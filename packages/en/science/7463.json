The miracle of miracles was growing\r\nto reality.\r\n\r\nFaintly now she breathed; vaguely her heart began to throb once more.\r\nShe stirred. She moaned, still for the moment powerless to cast off\r\nwholly the enshrouding incubus of that tremendous, dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\nThen her hands closed. The finely tapered fingers tangled themselves\r\nin the masses of thick, luxuriant hair which lay outspread all over\r\nand about her. The eyelids trembled.\r\n\r\nAnd, a moment later, Beatrice Kendrick was sitting up, dazed and\r\nutterly uncomprehending, peering about her at the strangest vision\r\nwhich since the world began had ever been the lot of any human\r\ncreature to behold--the vision of a place transformed beyond all power\r\nof the intellect to understand.\r\n\r\nFor of the room which she remembered, which had been her last sight\r\nwhen (so long, so very long, ago) her eyes had closed with that sudden\r\nand unconquerable drowsiness, of that room, I say, remained only\r\nwalls, ceiling, floor of rust-red steel and crumbling cement.\r\n\r\nQuite gone was all the plaster, as by magic. Here or there a heap of\r\nwhitish dust betrayed where some of its detritus still lay.\r\n\r\nGone was every picture, chart, and map--which--but an hour since, it\r\nseemed to her--had decked this office of Allan Stern, consulting\r\nengineer, this aerie up in the forty-eighth story of the Metropolitan\r\nTower.\r\n\r\nFurniture, there now was none. Over the still-intact glass of the\r\nwindows cobwebs were draped so thickly as almost to exclude the light\r\nof day--a strange, fly-infested curtain where once neat green\r\nshade-rollers had hung.\r\n\r\nEven as the bewildered girl sat there, lips parted, eyes wide with\r\namaze, a spider seized his buzzing prey and scampered back into a hole\r\nin the wall.\r\n\r\nA huge, leathery bat, suspended upside down in the far corner, cheeped\r\nwith dry, crepitant sounds of irritation.\r\n\r\nBeatrice rubbed her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" she said, quite slowly. \"Dreaming? How singular! I only wish I\r\ncould remember this when I wake up. Of all the dreams I've ever had,\r\nthis one's certainly the strangest. So real, so vivid! Why, I could\r\nswear I was awake--and yet--\"\r\n\r\nAll at once a sudden doubt flashed into her mind. An uneasy expression\r\ndawned across her face. Her eyes grew wild with a great fear; the fear\r\nof utter and absolute incomprehension.\r\n\r\nSomething about this room, this weird awakening, bore upon her\r\nconsciousness the dread tidings this was not a dream.\r\n\r\nSomething drove home to her the fact that it was real, objective,\r\npositive! And with a gasp of fright she struggled up amid the litter\r\nand the rubbish of that uncanny room.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she cried in terror, as a huge scorpion, malevolent, and with\r\nits tail raised to strike, scuttled away and vanished through a gaping\r\nvoid where once the corridor-door had swung. \"Oh, oh! Where _am_ I?\r\nWhat--_what has--happened?_\"\r\n\r\nHorrified beyond all words, pale and staring, both hands clutched to\r\nher breast, whereon her very clothing now had torn and crumbled, she\r\nfaced about.\r\n\r\nTo her it seemed as though some monstrous, evil thing were lurking in\r\nthe dim corner at her back. She tried to scream, but could utter no\r\nsound, save a choked gasp.\r\n\r\nThen she started toward the doorway. Even as she took the first few\r\nsteps her gown--a mere tattered mockery of garment--fell away from\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd, confronted by a new problem, she stopped short. About her she\r\npeered in vain for something to protect her disarray. There was\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\"Why--where's--where's my chair? My desk?\" she exclaimed thickly,\r\nstarting toward the place by the window where they should have been,\r\nand were not. Her shapely feet fell soundlessly in that strange and\r\nimpalpable dust which thickly coated everything.\r\n\r\n\"My typewriter? Is--can _that_ be my typewriter? Great Heavens! What's\r\nthe matter here, with everything? Am I mad?\"\r\n\r\nThere before her lay a somewhat larger pile of dust mixed with soft\r\nand punky splinters of rotten wood. Amid all this decay she saw some\r\nbits of rust, a corroded type-bar or two--even a few rubber key-caps,\r\nstill recognizable, though with the letters quite obliterated.\r\n\r\nAll about her, veiling her completely in a mantle of wondrous gloss\r\nand beauty, her lustrous hair fell, as she stooped to see this\r\nstrange, incomprehensible phenomenon. She tried to pick up one of the\r\nrubber caps. At her merest touch it crumbled to an impalpable white\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nBack with a shuddering cry the girl sprang, terrified.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Heavens!\" she supplicated. \"What--what does all this mean?\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment she stood there, her every power of thought, of motion,\r\nnumbed. Breathing not, she only stared in a wild kind of cringing\r\namazement, as perhaps you might do if you should see a dead man move.\r\n\r\nThen to the door she ran. Out into the hall she peered, this way and\r\nthat, down the dismantled corridor, up the wreckage of the stairs all\r\ncumbered, like the office itself, with dust and webs and vermin.\r\n\r\nAloud she hailed: \"Oh! Help, help, _help!_\" No answer. Even the echoes\r\nflung back only dull, vacuous sounds that deepened her sense of awful\r\nand incredible isolation.\r\n\r\nWhat? No noise of human life anywhere to be heard? None! No familiar\r\nhum of the metropolis now rose from what, when she had fallen asleep,\r\nhad been swarming streets and miles on miles of habitations.\r\n\r\nInstead, a blank, unbroken leaden silence, that seemed part of the\r\nmusty, choking atmosphere--a silence that weighed down on Beatrice\r\nlike funeral-palls.\r\n\r\nDumfounded by all this, and by the universal crumbling of every\r\nperishable thing, the girl ran, shuddering, back into the office.\r\nThere in the dust her foot struck something hard.\r\n\r\nShe stooped; she caught it up and stared at it.\r\n\r\n\"My glass ink-well! What? Only such things remain?\"\r\n\r\nNo dream, then, but reality! She knew at length that some catastrophe,\r\nincredibly vast, some disaster cosmic in the tragedy of its sweep, had\r\ndesolated the world.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my mother!\" cried she. \"My mother--_dead?_ Dead, now, how long?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not weep, but just stood cowering, a chill of anguished horror\r\nracking her. All at once her teeth began to chatter, her body to shake\r\nas with an ague.\r\n\r\nThus for a moment dazed and stunned she remained there, knowing not\r\nwhich way to turn nor what to do. Then her terror-stricken gaze fell\r\non the doorway leading from her outer office to the inner one, the one\r\nwhere Stern had had his laboratory and his consultation-room.\r\n\r\nThis door now hung, a few worm-eaten planks and splintered bits of\r\nwood, barely supported by the rusty hinges.\r\n\r\nToward it she staggered. About her she drew the sheltering masses of\r\nher hair, like a Godiva of another age; and to her eyes, womanlike,\r\nthe hot tears mounted. As she went, she cried in a voice of horror.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stern! Oh--Mr. Stern! Are--are _you_ dead, too? You _can't_\r\nbe--it's too frightful!\"\r\n\r\nShe reached the door. The mere touch of her outstretched hand\r\ndisintegrated it. Down in a crumbling mass it fell. Thick dust bellied\r\nup in a cloud, through which a single sun-ray that entered the\r\ncobwebbed pane shot a radiant arrow.\r\n\r\nPeering, hesitant, fearful of even greater terrors in that other room,\r\nBeatrice peered through this dust-haze. A sick foreboding of evil\r\npossessed her at thought of what she might find there--yet more afraid\r\nwas she of what she knew lay behind her.\r\n\r\nAn instant she stood within the ruined doorway, her left hand resting\r\non the moldy jam. Then, with a cry, she started forward--a cry in\r\nwhich terror had given place to joy, despair to hope.\r\n\r\nForgotten now the fact that, save for the shrouding of her messy hair,\r\nshe stood naked. Forgotten the wreck, the desolation everywhere.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--thank Heaven!\" gasped she.\r\n\r\nThere, in that inner office, half-rising from the wrack of many things\r\nthat had been and were now no more, her startled eyes beheld the\r\nfigure of a man--of Allan Stern!\r\n\r\nHe lived!\r\n\r\nAt her he peered with eyes that saw not, yet; toward her he groped a\r\nvague, unsteady hand.\r\n\r\nHe lived!\r\n\r\nNot quite alone in this world-ruin, not all alone was she!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nREALIZATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe joy in Beatrice's eyes gave way to poignant wonder as she\r\ngazed on him. Could this be _he?_\r\n\r\nYes, well she knew it was. She recognized him even through the\r\ngrotesquery of his clinging rags, even behind the mask of a long, red,\r\ndusty beard and formidable mustache, even despite the wild and staring\r\nincoherence of his whole expression.\r\n\r\nYet how incredible the metamorphosis! To her flashed a memory of this\r\nman, her other-time employer--keen and smooth-shaven, alert,\r\nwell-dressed, self-centered, dominant, the master of a hundred complex\r\nproblems, the directing mind of engineering works innumerable.\r\n\r\nFaltering and uncertain now he stood there. Then, at the sound of the\r\ngirl's voice, he staggered toward her with outflung hands. He stopped,\r\nand for a moment stared at her.\r\n\r\nFor he had had no time as yet to correlate his thoughts, to pull\r\nhimself together.\r\n\r\nAnd while one's heart might throb ten times, Beatrice saw terror in\r\nhis blinking, bloodshot eyes.\r\n\r\nBut almost at once the engineer mastered himself. Even as Beatrice\r\nwatched him, breathlessly, from the door, she saw his fear die out,\r\nshe saw his courage well up fresh and strong.\r\n\r\nIt was almost as though something tangible were limning the man's soul\r\nupon his face. She thrilled at sight of him.\r\n\r\nAnd though for a long moment no word was spoken, while the man and\r\nwoman stood looking at each other like two children in some dread and\r\nunfamiliar attic, an understanding leaped between them.\r\n\r\nThen, womanlike, instinctively as she breathed, the girl ran to him.\r\nForgetful of every convention and of her disarray, she seized his\r\nhand. And in a voice that trembled till it broke she cried:\r\n\r\n\"What is it? What does all this mean? Tell me!\"\r\n\r\nTo him she clung.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me the truth--and save me! Is it _real?_\"\r\n\r\nStern looked at her wonderingly. He smiled a strange, wan, mirthless\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nAll about him he looked. Then his lips moved, but for the moment no\r\nsound came.\r\n\r\nHe made another effort, this time successful.\r\n\r\n\"There, there,\" said he huskily, as though the dust and dryness of the\r\ninnumerable years had got into his very voice. \"There, now, don't be\r\nafraid!\r\n\r\n\"Something seems to have taken place here while--we've been asleep.\r\nWhat? What is it? I don't know yet. I'll find out. There's nothing to\r\nbe alarmed about, at any rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--_look!_\" She pointed at the hideous desolation.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see. But no matter. You're alive. I'm alive. That's two of us,\r\nanyhow. Maybe there are a lot more. We'll soon see. Whatever it may\r\nbe, we'll win.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and, trailing rags and streamers of rotten cloth that once\r\nhad been a business suit, he waded through the confusion of wreckage\r\non the floor to the window.\r\n\r\nIf you have seen a weather-beaten scarecrow flapping in the wind, you\r\nhave some notion of his outward guise. No tramp you ever laid eyes on\r\ncould have offered so preposterous an appearance.\r\n\r\nDown over his shoulders fell the matted, dusty hair. His tangled beard\r\nreached far below his waist. Even his eyebrows, naturally rather\r\nlight, had grown to a heavy thatch above his eyes.\r\n\r\nSave that he was not gray or bent, and that he still seemed to have\r\nkept the resilient force of vigorous manhood, you might have thought\r\nhim some incredibly ancient Rip Van Winkle come to life upon that\r\nsingular stage, there in the tower.\r\n\r\nBut little time gave he to introspection or the matter of his own\r\nappearance. With one quick gesture he swept away the shrouding tangle\r\nof webs, spiders, and dead flies that obscured the window. Out he\r\npeered.\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens!\" cried he, and started back a pace.\r\n\r\nShe ran to him.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" she breathlessly exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I don't know--yet. But this is something big! Something\r\nuniversal! It's--it's--no, no, you'd better not look out--not just\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must know everything. Let me see!\"\r\n\r\nNow she was at his side, and, like him, staring out into the clear\r\nsunshine, out over the vast expanses of the city.\r\n\r\nA moment's utter silence fell. Quite clearly hummed the protest of an\r\nimprisoned fly in a web at the top of the window. The breathing of the\r\nman and woman sounded quick and loud.\r\n\r\n\"All _wrecked!_\" cried Beatrice. \"But--then--\"\r\n\r\n\"Wrecked? It looks that way,\" the engineer made answer, with a strong\r\neffort holding his emotions in control. \"Why not be frank about this?\r\nYou'd better make up your mind at once to accept the very worst. I see\r\nno signs of anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"The worst? You mean--\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean just what we see out there. You can interpret it as well as\r\nI.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the silence while they looked, with emotions that could find no\r\nvoicing in words. Instinctively the engineer passed an arm about the\r\nfrightened girl and drew her close to him.\r\n\r\n\"And the last thing I remember,\" whispered she, \"was just--just after\r\nyou'd finished dictating those Taunton Bridge specifications. I\r\nsuddenly felt--oh, so sleepy! Only for a minute I thought I'd close my\r\neyes and rest, and then--then--\"\r\n\r\n\"_This?_\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Same here,\" said he. \"What the deuce _can_ have struck us? Us and\r\neverybody--and everything? Talk about your problems! Lucky I'm sane\r\nand sound, and--and--\"\r\n\r\nHe did not finish, but fell once more to studying the incomprehensible\r\nprospect.\r\n\r\nTheir view was towards the east, but over the river and the reaches of\r\nwhat had once upon a time been Long Island City and Brooklyn, as\r\nfamiliar a scene in the other days as could be possibly imagined. But\r\nnow how altered an aspect greeted them!\r\n\r\n\"It's surely all wiped out, all gone, gone into ruins,\" said Stern\r\nslowly and carefully, weighing each word. \"No hallucination about\r\n_that_.\" He swept the sky-line with his eyes, that now peered keenly\r\nout from beneath those bushy brows. Instinctively he brought his hand\r\nup to his breast. He started with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"What's this?\" he cried. \"Why, I--I've got a full yard of whiskers. My\r\ngood Lord! Whiskers on _me?_ And I used to say--\"\r\n\r\nHe burst out laughing. At his beard he plucked with merriment that\r\njangled horribly on the girl's tense nerves. Suddenly he grew serious.\r\nFor the first time he seemed to take clear notice of his companion's\r\nplight.\r\n\r\n\"Why, _what_ a time it must have been!\" cried he. \"Here's some\r\ncalculation all cut out for me, all right. But--you can't go that way,\r\nMiss Kendrick. It--it won't do, you know. Got to have something to put\r\non. Great Heavens what a situation!\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to peel off his remnant of a coat, but at the merest touch it\r\ntore to shreds and fell away. The girl restrained him.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said she, with quiet, modest dignity. \"My hair protects\r\nme very well for the present. If you and I are all that's left of the\r\npeople in the world, this is no time for trifles.\"\r\n\r\nA moment he studied her. Then he nodded, and grew very grave.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me,\" he whispered, laying a hand on her shoulder. Once more\r\nhe turned to the window and looked out.\r\n\r\n\"So then, it's all gone?\" he queried, speaking as to himself. \"Only a\r\nskyscraper standing here or there? And the bridges and the\r\nislands--all changed.\r\n\r\n\"Not a sign of life anywhere; not a sound; the forests growing thick\r\namong the ruins? A dead world if--if all the world is like this part\r\nof it! All dead, save _you_ and _me!_\"\r\n\r\nIn silence they stood there, striving to realize the full import of\r\nthe catastrophe. And Stern, deep down in his heart, caught some\r\nglimmering insight of the future and was glad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nON THE TOWER PLATFORM\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly the girl started, rebelling against the evidence of\r\nher own senses, striving again to force upon herself the belief that,\r\nafter all, it _could not_ be so.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no!\" she cried. \"This can't be true. It mustn't be. There's a\r\nmistake somewhere. This simply _must_ be all an illusion, a dream!\r\n\r\n\"If the whole world's dead, how does it happen _we're_ alive? How do\r\nwe know it's dead? Can we see it all from here? Why, all we see is\r\njust a little segment of things. Perhaps if we could know the truth,\r\nlook farther, and know--\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you'll find it's real enough,\" he answered, \"no matter how\r\nfar you look. But, just the same, it won't do any harm to extend our\r\nradius of observation.\r\n\r\n\"Come, let's go on up to the top of the tower, up to the\r\nobservation-platform. The quicker we know all the available facts the\r\nbetter. Now, if I only had a telescope--!\"\r\n\r\nHe thought hard a moment, then turned and strode over to a heap of\r\nfriable disintegration that lay where once his instrument case had\r\nstood, containing his surveying tools.\r\n\r\nDown on his ragged knees he fell; his rotten shreds of clothing tore\r\nand ripped at every movement, like so much water-soaked paper.\r\n\r\nA strange, hairy, dust-covered figure, he knelt there. Quickly he\r\nplunged his hands into the rubbish and began pawing it over and over\r\nwith eager haste.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he cried with triumph. \"Thank Heaven, brass and lenses haven't\r\ncrumbled yet!\"\r\n\r\nUp he stood again. In his hand the girl saw a peculiar telescope.\r\n\r\n\"My 'level,' see?\" he exclaimed, holding it up to view. \"The wooden\r\ntripod's long since gone. The fixtures that held it on won't bother me\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n\"Neither will the spirit-glass on top. The main thing is that the\r\ntelescope itself seems to be still intact. Now we'll see.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking, he dusted off the eye-piece and the objective with a bit of\r\nrag from his coat-sleeve.\r\n\r\nBeatrice noted that the brass tubes were all eaten and pitted with\r\nverdigris, but they still held firmly. And the lenses, when Stern had\r\nfinished cleaning them, showed as bright and clear as ever.\r\n\r\n\"Come, now; come with me,\" he bade.\r\n\r\nOut through the doorway into the hall he made his way while the girl\r\nfollowed. As she went she gathered her wondrous veil of hair more\r\nclosely about her.\r\n\r\nIn this universal disorganization, this wreck of all the world, how\r\nlittle the conventions counted!\r\n\r\nTogether, picking their way up the broken stairs, where now the\r\nrust-bitten steel showed through the corroded stone and cement in a\r\nthousand places, they cautiously climbed.\r\n\r\nHere, spider-webs thickly shrouded the way, and had to be brushed\r\ndown. There, still more bats bung and chippered in protest as the\r\nintruders passed.\r\n\r\nA fluffy little white owl blinked at them from a dark niche; and, well\r\ntoward the top of the climb, they flushed up a score of mud-swallows\r\nwhich had ensconced themselves comfortably along a broken balustrade.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, despite all unforeseen incidents of this sort, they\r\nreached the upper platform, nearly a thousand feet above the earth.\r\n\r\nOut through the relics of the revolving door they crept, he leading,\r\ntesting each foot of the way before the girl. They reached the narrow\r\nplatform of red tiling that surrounded the tower.\r\n\r\nEven here they saw with growing amazement that the hand of time and of\r\nthis maddening mystery had laid its heavy imprint.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" he exclaimed, pointing. \"What this all means we don't know\r\nyet. How long it's been we can't tell. But to judge by the appearance\r\nup here, it's even longer than I thought. See, the very tiles are\r\ncracked and crumbling.\r\n\r\n\"Tilework is usually considered highly recalcitrant--but _this_ is\r\ngone. There's grass growing in the dust that's settled between the\r\ntiles. And--why, here's a young oak that's taken root and forced a\r\ndozen slabs out of place.\"\r\n\r\n\"The winds and birds have carried seeds up here, and acorns,\" she\r\nanswered in an awed voice. \"Think of the time that must have passed.\r\nYears and years.\r\n\r\n\"But tell me,\" and her brow wrinkled with a sudden wonder, \"tell me\r\nhow we've ever lived so long? _I_ can't understand it.\r\n\r\n\"Not only have we escaped starvation, but we haven't frozen to death\r\nin all these bitter winters. How can _that_ have happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it all go as suspended animation till we learn the facts, if we\r\never do,\" he replied, glancing about with wonder.\r\n\r\n\"You know, of course, how toads have been known to live embedded in\r\nrock for centuries? How fish, hard-frozen, have been brought to life\r\nagain? Well--\"\r\n\r\n\"But we are human beings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. Certain unknown natural forces, however, might have made no\r\nmore of us than of non-mammalian and less highly organized creatures.\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother your head about these problems yet a while. On my word,\r\nwe've got enough to do for the present without much caring about how\r\nor why.\r\n\r\n\"All we definitely know is that some very long, undetermined period of\r\ntime has passed, leaving us still alive. The rest can wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long a time do you judge it?\" she anxiously inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible to say at once. But it must have been something\r\nextraordinary--probably far longer than either of us suspect.\r\n\r\n\"See, for example, the attrition of everything up here exposed to the\r\nweather.\" He pointed at the heavy stone railing. \"See how _that_ is\r\nwrecked, for instance.\"\r\n\r\nA whole segment, indeed, had fallen inward. Its debris lay in\r\nconfusion, blocking all the southern side of the platform.\r\n\r\nThe bronze bars, which Stern well remembered--two at each corner,\r\nslanting downward and bracing a rail--had now wasted to mere\r\npockmarked shells of metal.\r\n\r\nThree had broken entirely and sagged wantonly awry with the\r\ndisplacement of the stone blocks, between which the vines and grasses\r\nhad long been carrying on their destructive work.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" Stern cautioned. \"Don't lean against any of those stones.\"\r\nFirmly he held her back as she, eagerly inquisitive, started to\r\nadvance toward the railing.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go anywhere near the edge. It may all be rotten and undermined,\r\nfor anything we know. Keep back here, close to the wall.\"\r\n\r\nSharply he inspected it a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Facing stones are pretty well gone,\" said he, \"but, so far as I can\r\nsee, the steel frame isn't too bad. Putting everything together, I'll\r\nprobably be able before long to make some sort of calculation of the\r\ndate. But for now we'll have to call it 'X,' and let it go at that.\"\r\n\r\n\"The year X!\" she whispered under her breath. \"Good Heavens, am I as\r\nold as that?\"\r\n\r\nHe made no answer, but only drew her to him protectingly, while all\r\nabout them the warm summer wind swept onward to the sea, out over the\r\nsparkling expanses of the bay--alone unchanged in all that universal\r\nwreckage.\r\n\r\nIn the breeze her heavy masses of hair stirred luringly. He felt its\r\nsilken caress on his half-naked shoulder, and in his ears the blood\r\nbegan to pound with strange insistence.\r\n\r\nQuite gone now the daze and drowsiness of the first wakening. Stern\r\ndid not even feel weak or shaken. On the contrary, never had life\r\nbounded more warmly, more fully, in his veins.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the girl set his heart throbbing heavily, but he bit\r\nhis lip and restrained every untoward thought.\r\n\r\nOnly his arm tightened a little about that warmly clinging body.\r\nBeatrice did not shrink from him. She needed his protection as never\r\nsince the world began had woman needed man.\r\n\r\nTo her it seemed that come what might, his strength and comfort could\r\nnot fail. And, despite everything, she could not--for the moment--find\r\nunhappiness within her heart.\r\n\r\nQuite vanished now, even in those brief minutes since their awakening,\r\nwas all consciousness of their former relationship--employer and\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThe self-contained, courteous, yet unapproachable engineer had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nNow, through all the extraneous disguise of his outer self, there\r\nlived and breathed just a man, a young man, thewed with the vigor of\r\nhis plentitude. All else had been swept clean away by this great\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nThe girl was different, too. Was this strong woman, eager-eyed and\r\nbrave, the quiet, low-voiced stenographer he remembered, busy only\r\nwith her machine, her file-boxes, and her carbon-copies? Stern dared\r\nnot realize the transmutation. He ventured hardly fringe it in his\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nTo divert his wonderings and to ease a situation which oppressed him,\r\nhe began adjusting the \"level\" telescope to his eye.\r\n\r\nWith his back planted firmly against the tower, he studied a wide\r\nsection of the dead and buried world so very far below them. With\r\nastonishment he cried:\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ true, Beatrice! Everything's swept clean away. Nothing left,\r\nnothing at all--no signs of life!\r\n\r\n\"As far as I can reach with these lenses, universal ruin. We're all\r\nalone in this whole world, just you and I--and everything belongs to\r\nus!\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything--all ours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything! Even the future--the future of the human race!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly he felt her tremble at his side. Down at her he looked, a\r\ngreat new tenderness possessing him. He saw that tears were forming in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nBeatrice pressed both hands to her face and bowed her head. Filled\r\nwith strange emotions, the man watched her for a moment.\r\n\r\nThen in silence, realizing the uselessness of any words, knowing that\r\nin this monstrous Ragnarok of all humanity no ordinary relations of\r\nlife could bear either cogency or meaning, he took her in his arms.\r\n\r\nAnd there alone with her, far above the ruined world, high in the pure\r\nair of mid-heaven, he comforted the girl with words till then\r\nunthought-of and unknown to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE CITY OF DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently Beatrice grew calmer. For though grief and terror\r\nstill weighed upon her soul, she realized that this was no fit time to\r\nyield to any weakness--now when a thousand things were pressing for\r\naccomplishment, if their own lives, too, were not presently to be\r\nsnuffed out in all this universal death.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come,\" said Stern reassuringly. \"I want you, too, to get a\r\ncomplete idea of what has happened. From now on you must know all,\r\nshare all, with me.\" And, taking her by the hand he led her along the\r\ncrumbling and uncertain platform.\r\n\r\nTogether, very cautiously, they explored the three sides of the\r\nplatform still unchoked by ruins.\r\n\r\nOut over the incredible mausoleum of civilization they peered. Now and\r\nagain they fortified their vision by recourse to the telescope.\r\n\r\nNowhere, as he had said, was any slightest sign of life to be\r\ndiscerned. Nowhere a thread of smoke arose; nowhere a sound echoed\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nDead lay the city, between its rivers, whereon now no sail glinted in\r\nthe sunlight, no tug puffed vehemently with plumy jets of steam, no\r\nliner idled at anchor or nosed its slow course out to sea.\r\n\r\nThe Jersey shore, the Palisades, the Bronx and Long Island all lay\r\nburied in dense forests of conifers and oak, with only here and there\r\nsome skeleton mockery of a steel structure jutting through.\r\n\r\nThe islands in the harbor, too, were thickly overgrown. On Ellis, no\r\nsign of the immigrant station remained. Castle William was quite gone.\r\nAnd with a gasp of dismay and pain, Beatrice pointed out the fact that\r\nno longer Liberty held her bronze torch aloft.\r\n\r\nSave for a black, misshapen mass protruding through the tree-tops, the\r\nhuge gift of France was no more.\r\n\r\nFringing the water-front, all the way round, the mournful remains of\r\nthe docks and piers lay in a mere sodden jumble of decay, with an\r\noccasional hulk sunk alongside.\r\n\r\nEven over these wrecks of liners, vegetation was growing rank and\r\ngreen. All the wooden ships, barges and schooners had utterly\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nThe telescope showed only a stray, lolling mast of steel, here or\r\nyonder, thrusting up from the desolation, like a mute appealing hand\r\nraised to a Heaven that responded not.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" remarked Stern, \"up-town almost all the buildings seem to have\r\ncrumbled in upon themselves, or to have fallen outward into the\r\nstreets. What an inconceivable tangle of detritus those streets must\r\nbe!\r\n\r\n\"And, do you notice the park hardly shows at all? Everything's so\r\novergrown with trees you can't tell where it begins or ends. Nature\r\nhas her revenge at last, on man!\"\r\n\r\n\"The universal claim, made real,\" said Beatrice. \"Those rather clearer\r\nlines of green, I suppose, must be the larger streets. See how the\r\navenues stretch away and away, like ribbons of green velvet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everywhere that roots can hold at all, Mother Nature has set up her\r\nflags again. Hark! What's that?\"\r\n\r\nA moment they listened intently. Up to them, from very far, rose a\r\nwailing cry, tremulous, long-drawn, formidable.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Then there _are_ people, after all?\" faltered the girl, grasping\r\nStern's arm.\r\n\r\nHe laughed.\r\n\r\n\"No, hardly!\" answered he. \"I see you don't know the wolf-cry. I\r\ndidn't till I heard it in the Hudson Bay country, last winter--that\r\nis, last winter, plus X. Not very pleasant, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wolves! Then--there are--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? Probably all sorts of game on the island now. Why shouldn't\r\nthere be? All in Mother Nature's stock-in-trade, you know.\r\n\r\n\"But come, come, don't let that worry you. We're safe, for the\r\npresent. Time enough to consider hunting later. Let's creep around\r\nhere to the other side of the tower, and see what we can see.\"\r\n\r\nSilently she acquiesced. Together they reached the southern part of\r\nthe platform, making their way as far as the jumbled rocks of the\r\nfallen railing would permit.\r\n\r\nVery carefully they progressed, fearful every moment lest the support\r\nbreak beneath them and hurl them down along the sloping side of the\r\npinnacle to death.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" bade Stern, pointing. \"That very long green line there used to\r\nbe Broadway. Quite a respectable Forest of Arden now, isn't it?\" He\r\nswept his hand far outward.\r\n\r\n\"See those steel cages, those tiny, far-off ones with daylight shining\r\nthrough? You know them--the Park Row, the Singer, the Woolworth and\r\nall the rest. And the bridges, look at those!\"\r\n\r\nShe shivered at the desolate sight. Of the Brooklyn Bridge only the\r\ntowers were visible.\r\n\r\nThe watchers, two isolated castaways on their island in the sea of\r\nuttermost desolation, beheld a dragging mass of wreckage that drooped\r\nfrom these towers on either shore, down to the sparkling flood.\r\n\r\nThe other bridges, newer and stronger far, still remained standing.\r\nBut even from that distance Stern could quite plainly see, without the\r\ntelescope, that the Williamsburg Bridge had \"buckled\" downward and\r\nthat the farther span of the Blackwell's Island Bridge was in ruinous\r\ndisrepair.\r\n\r\n\"How horrible, how ghastly is all this waste and ruin!\" thought the\r\nengineer. \"Yet, even in their overthrow, how wonderful are the works\r\nof man!\"\r\n\r\nA vast wonder seized him as he stood there gazing; a fierce desire to\r\nrehabilitate all this wreckage, to set it right, to start the wheels\r\nof the world-machinery running once more.\r\n\r\nAt the thought of his own powerlessness a bitter smile curled his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nBeatrice seemed to share something of his wonder.\r\n\r\n\"Can it be possible,\" whispered she, \"that you and--and I--are really\r\nlike Macaulay's lone watcher of the world-wreck on London Bridge?\"\r\n\r\n\"That we are actually seeing the thing so often dreamed of by prophets\r\nand poets? That 'All this mighty heart is lying still,' at\r\nlast--forever? The heart of the world, never to beat again?\"\r\n\r\nHe made no answer, save to shake his head; but fast his thoughts were\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\nSo then, could he and Beatrice, just they two, be in stern reality the\r\nsole survivors of the entire human race? That race for whose material\r\nwelfare he had, once on a time, done such tremendous work?\r\n\r\nCould they be destined, he and she, to witness the closing chapter in\r\nthe long, painful, glorious Book of Evolution? Slightly he shivered\r\nand glanced round.\r\n\r\nTill he could adjust his reason to the facts, could learn the truth\r\nand weigh it, he knew he must not analyze too closely; he felt he must\r\ntry not to think. For _that_ way lay madness!\r\n\r\nFar out she gazed.\r\n\r\nThe sun, declining, shot a broad glory all across the sky. Purple and\r\ngold and crimson lay the light-bands over the breast of the Hudson.\r\n\r\nDark blue the shadows streamed across the ruined city with its\r\ncrowding forests, its blank-staring windows and sagging walls, its\r\nthousands of gaping vacancies, where wood and stone and brick had\r\ncrumbled down--the city where once the tides of human life had ebbed\r\nand flowed, roaring resistlessly.\r\n\r\nHigh overhead drifted a few rosy clouds, part of that changeless\r\nnature which alone did not repel or mystify these two beleaguered\r\nwaifs, these chance survivors, this man, this woman, left alone\r\ntogether by the hand of fate.\r\n\r\nThey were dazed, fascinated by the splendor of that sunset over a\r\nworld devoid of human life, for the moment giving up all efforts to\r\njudge or understand.\r\n\r\nStern and his mate peered closer, down at the interwoven jungles of\r\nUnion Square, the leafy frond-masses that marked the one-time course\r\nof Twenty-Third Street, the forest in Madison Square, and the\r\ntruncated column of the tower where no longer Diana turned her\r\nhuntress bow to every varying breeze.\r\n\r\nThey heard their own hearts beat. The intake of their breath sounded\r\nstrangely loud. Above them, on a broken cornice, some resting swallows\r\ntwittered.\r\n\r\nAll at once the girl spoke.\r\n\r\n\"See the Flatiron Building over there!\" said she. \"What a hideous\r\nwreck!\"\r\n\r\nFrom Stern she took the telescope, adjusted it, and gazed minutely at\r\nthe shattered pile of stone and metal.\r\n\r\nBlotched as with leprosy stood the walls, whence many hundreds of\r\nblocks had fallen into Broadway forming a vast moraine that for some\r\ndistance choked that thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nIn numberless places the steel frame peered through. The whole roof\r\nhad caved in, crushing down the upper stories, of which only a few\r\nsparse upstanding metal beams remained.\r\n\r\nThe girl's gaze was directed at a certain spot which she knew well.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can even see--into some of the offices on the eighteenth\r\nfloor!\" cried she. \"There, _look?_\" And she pointed. \"That one near\r\nthe front! I--I used to know--\"\r\n\r\nShe broke short off. In her trembling hands the telescope sank. Stern\r\nsaw that she was very pale.\r\n\r\n\"Take me down!\" she whispered. \"I can't stand it any longer--I can't,\r\npossibly! The sight of that wrecked office! Let's go down where I\r\ncan't see _that!_\"\r\n\r\nGently, as though she had been a frightened child, Stern led her round\r\nthe platform to the doorway, then down the crumbling stairs and so to\r\nthe wreckage and dust-strewn confusion of what had been his office.\r\n\r\nAnd there, his hand upon her shoulder, he bade her still be of good\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n\"Listen now, Beatrice,\" said he. \"Let's try to reason this thing out\r\ntogether, let's try to solve this problem like two intelligent human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\n\"Just what's happened, we don't know; we can't know yet a while, till\r\nI investigate. We don't even know what year this is.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know whether anybody else is still alive, anywhere in the\r\nworld. But we can find out--after we've made provision for the\r\nimmediate present and formed some rational plan of life.\r\n\r\n\"If all the rest _are_ gone, swept away, wiped out clean like figures\r\non a slate, then why _we_ should have happened to survive whatever it\r\nwas that struck the earth, is still a riddle far beyond our\r\ncomprehension.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised her face to his, noble despite all its grotesque\r\ndisfigurements; he looked into her eyes as though to read the very\r\nsoul of her, to judge whether she could share this fight, could brave\r\nthis coming struggle.\r\n\r\n\"All these things may yet be answered. Once I get the proper data for\r\nthis series of phenomena, I can find the solution, never fear!\r\n\r\n\"Some vast world-duty may be ours, far greater, infinitely more vital\r\nthan anything that either of us has ever dreamed. It's not our place,\r\nnow, to mourn or fear! Rather it is to read this mystery, to meet it\r\nand to conquer!\"\r\n\r\nThrough her tears the girl smiled up at him, trustingly, confidingly.\r\nAnd in the last declining rays of the sun that glinted through the\r\nwindow-pane, her eyes were very beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION\r\n\r\n\r\nCame now the evening, as they sat and talked together, talked\r\nlong and earnestly, there within that ruined place. Too eager for some\r\nknowledge of the truth, they, to feel hunger or to think of their lack\r\nof clothing.\r\n\r\nChairs they had none, nor even so much as a broom to clean the floor\r\nwith. But Stern, first-off, had wrenched a marble slab from the\r\nstairway.\r\n\r\nAnd with this plank of stone still strong enough to serve, he had\r\nscraped all one corner of the office floor free of rubbish. This gave\r\nthem a preliminary camping-place wherein to take their bearings and\r\ndiscuss what must be done.\r\n\r\n\"So then,\" the engineer was saying as the dusk grew deeper, \"so then,\r\nwe'll apparently have to make this building our headquarters for a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n\"As nearly as I can figure, this is about what must have happened.\r\nSome sudden, deadly, numbing plague or cataclysm must have struck the\r\nearth, long, long ago.\r\n\r\n\"It may have been an almost instantaneous onset of some new and highly\r\nfatal micro-organism, propagating with such marvelous rapidity that it\r\nswept the world clean in a day--doing its work before any resistance\r\ncould be organized or thought of.\r\n\r\n\"Again, some poisonous gas may have developed, either from a fissure\r\nin the earth's crust, or otherwise. Other hypotheses are possible, but\r\nof what practical value are they now?\r\n\r\n\"We only know that here, in this uppermost office of the Tower, you\r\nand I have somehow escaped with only a long period of completely\r\nsuspended animation. How long? God alone knows! That's a query I can't\r\neven guess the answer to as yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to judge by all the changes,\" Beatrice suggested thoughtfully,\r\n\"it can't have been less than a hundred years. Great Heavens!\" and she\r\nburst into a little satiric laugh. \"Am _I_ a hundred and twenty-four\r\nyears old? Think of that!\"\r\n\r\n\"You underestimate,\" Stern answered. \"But no matter about the time\r\nquestion for the present; we can't solve it now.\r\n\r\n\"Neither can we solve the other problem about Europe and Asia and all\r\nthe rest of the world. Whether London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and every\r\nother city, every other land, all have shared this fate, we simply\r\ndon't know.\r\n\r\n\"All we _can_ have is a feeling of strong probability that life, human\r\nlife I mean, is everywhere extinct--save right here in this room!\r\n\r\n\"Otherwise, don't you see, men would have made their way back here\r\nagain, back to New York, where all these incalculable treasures seem\r\nto have perished, and--\"\r\n\r\nHe broke short off. Again, far off, they heard a faint re-echoing roar.\r\nFor a moment they both sat speechless. What could it be? Some distant\r\nwall toppling down? A hungry beast scenting its prey? They could not\r\ntell. But Stern smiled.\r\n\r\n\"I guess,\" said he, \"guns will be about the first thing I'll look for,\r\nafter food. There ought to be good hunting down in the jungles of\r\nFifth Avenue and Broadway!\r\n\r\n\"You shoot, of course? No? Well, I'll soon teach you. Lots of things\r\nboth of us have got to learn now. No end of them!\"\r\n\r\nHe rose from his place on the floor, went over to the window and stood\r\nfor a minute peering out into the gloom. Then suddenly he turned.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with me, anyhow?\" he exclaimed with irritation.\r\n\"What right have I to be staying here, theorizing, when there's work\r\nto do? I ought to be busy this very minute!\r\n\r\n\"In some way or other I've got to find food, clothing, tools, arms--a\r\nthousand things. And above all, water! And here I've been speculating\r\nabout the past, fool that I am!\"\r\n\r\n\"You--you aren't going to leave me--not to-night?\" faltered the girl.\r\n\r\nStern seemed not to have heard her, so strong the imperative of action\r\nlay upon him now. He began to pace the floor, sliding and stumbling\r\nthrough the rubbish, a singular figure in his tatters and with his\r\npatriarchal hair and beard, a figure dimly seen by the faint light\r\nthat still gloomed through the window:\r\n\r\n\"In all that wreckage down below,\" said he, as though half to himself,\r\n\"in all that vast congeries of ruin which once was called New York,\r\nsurely enough must still remain intact for our small needs. Enough\r\ntill we can reach the land, the country, and raise food of our own!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't go _now!_\" pleaded Beatrice. She, too, stood up, and out she\r\nstretched her hands to him. \"Don't, please! We can get along some way\r\nor other till morning. At least, _I_ can!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, it isn't right! Down in the shops and stores, who knows but\r\nwe might find--\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're unarmed! And in the streets--in the forest, rather--\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" he commanded rather abruptly. \"This is no time for\r\nhesitating or for weakness. I know you'll stand your share of all that\r\nwe must suffer, dare and do together.\r\n\r\n\"Some way or other I've got to make you comfortable. I've got to\r\nlocate food and drink immediately. Got to get my bearings. Why, do you\r\nthink I'm going to let you, even for one night, go fasting and\r\nthirsty, sleep on bare cement, and all that sort of thing?\r\n\r\n\"If so, you're mistaken! No, you must spare me for an hour or two.\r\nInside of that time I ought to make a beginning!\"\r\n\r\n\"A whole hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two would probably be nearer it. I promise to be back inside of that\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" and her voice quivered just a trifle, \"but suppose some wolf or\r\nbear--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm not quite so foolhardy as all that!\" he retorted. \"I'm not\r\ngoing to venture outside till to-morrow. My idea is that I can find at\r\nleast a few essentials right here in this building.\r\n\r\n\"It's a city in itself--or was. Offices, stores, shops, everything\r\nright here together in a lump. It can't possibly take me very long to\r\ngo down and rummage out something for your comfort.\r\n\r\n\"Now that the first shock and surprise of our awakening are over, we\r\ncan't go on in this way, you know--h'm!--dressed in--well, such\r\nexceedingly primitive garb!\"\r\n\r\nSilently she looked at his dim figure in the dusk. Then she stretched\r\nout her hand.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go too,\" said she quite simply.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better stay. It's safer here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm going.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if we run into dangers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind. Take me with you.\"\r\n\r\nOver to her he came. He took her hand. In silence he pressed it. Thus\r\nfor a moment they stood. Then, arousing himself to action, he said:\r\n\"First of all, a light.\"\r\n\r\n\"A light? How can you make a light? Why, there isn't a match left\r\nanywhere in this whole world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, but there are other things. Probably my chemical flasks and\r\nvials aren't injured. Glass is practically imperishable. And if I'm\r\nnot mistaken, the bottles must be lying somewhere in that rubbish heap\r\nover by the window.\"\r\n\r\nHe left her wondering, and knelt among the litter. For a while he\r\nsilently delved through the triturated bits of punky wood and rust-red\r\nmetal that now represented the remains of his chemical cabinet.\r\n\r\nAll at once he exclaimed: \"Here's one! And here's another! This\r\ncertainly _is_ luck! H-m! I shouldn't wonder if I got almost all of\r\nthem back.\"\r\n\r\nOne by one he found a score of thick, ground-glass vials. Some were\r\nbroken, probably by the shock when they and the cabinet had fallen,\r\nbut a good many still remained intact.\r\n\r\nAmong these were the two essential ones. By the last dim ghost of\r\nlight through the window, and by the sense of touch, Stern was able to\r\nmake out the engraved symbols \"P\" and \"S\" on these bottles.\r\n\r\n\"Phosphorus and sulphur,\" he commented. \"Well, what more could I\r\nreasonably ask? Here's alcohol, too, hermetically sealed. Not too bad,\r\neh?\"\r\n\r\nWhile the girl watched, with wondering admiration, Stern thought hard\r\na moment. Then he set to work.\r\n\r\nFirst he took a piece of the corroded metal framework of the cabinet,\r\na steel strip about eighteen inches long, frail in places, but still\r\nsufficiently strong to serve his purpose.\r\n\r\nTearing off some rags from his coat-sleeve, he wadded them together\r\ninto a ball as big as his fist. Around this ball he twisted the metal\r\nstrip, so that it formed at once a holder and a handle for the\r\nrag-mass.\r\n\r\nWith considerable difficulty he worked the glass stopper out of the\r\nalcohol bottle, and with the fluid saturated the rags. Then, on a\r\nclear bit of the floor, he spilled out a small quantity of the\r\nphosphorus and sulphur.\r\n\r\n\"This beats getting fire by friction all hollow,\" he cheerfully\r\nremarked. \"I've tried that, too, and I guess it's only in books a\r\nwhite man ever succeeds at it. But this way you see, it's simplicity\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\nVery moderate friction, with a bit of wood from the wreckage of the\r\ndoor, sufficed to set the phosphorus ablaze. Stern heaped on a few\r\ntiny lumps of sulphur. Then, coughing as the acrid fumes arose from\r\nthe sputter of blue flame, he applied the alcohol-soaked torch.\r\n\r\nInstantly a puff of fire shot up, colorless and clear, throwing no\r\nvery satisfactory light, yet capable of dispelling the thickest of the\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nThe blaze showed Stern's eager face, long-bearded and dusty, as he\r\nbent over this crucial experiment.\r\n\r\nThe girl, watching closely, felt a strange new thrill of confidence\r\nand solace. Some realization of the engineer's resourcefulness came to\r\nher, and in her heart she had confidence that, though the whole wide\r\nworld had crumbled into ruin, yet _he_ would find a way to smooth her\r\npath, to be a strength and refuge for her.\r\n\r\nBut Stern had no time for any but matters of intensest practicality.\r\nFrom the floor he arose, holding the flambeau in one hand, the bottle\r\nof alcohol in the other.\r\n\r\n\"Come now,\" bade he, and raised the torch on high to light her way,\r\n\"You're still determined to go?\"\r\n\r\nFor an answer she nodded. Her eyes gleamed by the uncanny light.\r\n\r\nAnd so, together, he leading out of the room and along the wrecked\r\nhall, they started on their trip of exploration out into the unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTREASURE-TROVE\r\n\r\n\r\nNever before had either of them realized just what the meaning\r\nof forty-eight stories might be. For all their memories of this height\r\nwere associated with smooth-sliding elevators that had whisked them up\r\nas though the tremendous height had been the merest trifle.\r\n\r\nThis night, however, what with the broken stairs, the debris-cumbered\r\nhallways, the lurking darkness which the torch could hardly hold back\r\nfrom swallowing them, they came to a clear understanding of the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nEvery few minutes the flame burned low and Stern had to drop on more\r\nalcohol, holding the bottle high above the flame to avoid explosion.\r\n\r\nLong before they had compassed the distance to the ground floor the\r\ngirl lagged with weariness and shrank with nameless fears.\r\n\r\nEach black doorway that yawned along their path seemed ominous with\r\nmemories of life that had perished there, of death that now reigned\r\nall-supreme.\r\n\r\nEach corner, every niche and crevice, breathed out the spirit of the\r\npast and of the mystic tragedy which in so brief a time had wiped the\r\nhuman race from earth, \"as a mother wipes the milky lips of her\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Stern, though he said little save to guide Beatrice and warn her\r\nof unusual difficulties, felt the somber magic of the place. No poet,\r\nhe; only a man of hard and practical details. Yet he realized that,\r\nwere he dowered with the faculty, here lay matter for an Epic of Death\r\nsuch as no Homer ever dreamed, no Virgil ever could have penned.\r\n\r\nNow and then, along the corridors and down the stairways, they chanced\r\non curious little piles of dust, scattered at random in fantastic\r\nshapes.\r\n\r\nThese for a few minutes puzzled Stern, till stooping, he stirred one\r\nwith his hand. Something he saw there made him start back with a\r\nstifled exclamation.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" cried the girl, startled. \"Tell me!\"\r\n\r\nBut he, realizing the nature of his discovery--for he had seen a human\r\nincisor tooth, gold-filled, there in the odd little heap--straightened\r\nup quickly and assumed to smile.\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing, nothing at all!\" he answered. \"Come, we haven't got any\r\ntime to waste. If we're going to provide ourselves with even a few\r\nnecessaries before the alcohol's all gone, we've got to be at work!\"\r\n\r\nAnd onward, downward, ever farther and farther, he led her through the\r\ndark maze of ruin, which did not even echo to their barefoot tread.\r\n\r\nLike disheveled wraiths they passed, soundlessly, through eerie\r\nlabyrinths and ways which might have served as types of Coleridge's\r\n\"caverns measureless to man,\" so utterly drear they stretched out in\r\ntheir ghostly desolation.\r\n\r\nAt length, after an eternal time of weariness and labor, they managed\r\nto make their way down into the ruins of the once famous and beautiful\r\narcade which had formerly run from Madison Avenue to the square.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how horrible!\" gasped Beatrice, shrinking, as they clambered down\r\nthe stairs and emerged into this scene of chaos, darkness, death.\r\n\r\nWhere long ago the arcade had stretched its path of light and life and\r\nbeauty, of wealth and splendor, like an epitome of civilization all\r\ngathered in that constricted space, the little light disclosed stark\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nFeeble as a will-o'-the-wisp in that enshrouding dark, the torch\r\nshowed only hints of things--here a fallen pillar, there a shattered\r\nmass of wreckage where a huge section of the ceiling had fallen,\r\nyonder a gaping aperture left by the disintegration of a wall.\r\n\r\nThrough all this rubbish and confusion, over and through a score of\r\nthe little dust-piles which Stern had so carefully avoided explaining\r\nto Beatrice, they climbed and waded, and with infinite pains slowly\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\n\"What we need is more light!\" exclaimed the engineer presently. \"We've\r\ngot to have a bonfire here!\"\r\n\r\nAnd before long he had collected a considerable pile of wood, ripped\r\nfrom the door-ways and window-casings of the arcade. This he set fire\r\nto, in the middle of the floor.\r\n\r\nSoon a dull, wavering glow began to paint itself upon the walls, and\r\nto fling the comrades' shadows, huge and weird, in dancing mockery\r\nacross the desolation.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, many of the large plate-glass windows lining the\r\narcade still stood intact. They glittered with the uncanny reflections\r\nof the fire as the man and woman slowly made way down the passage.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" exclaimed Stern, pointing. \"See all these ruined shops?\r\nProbably almost everything is worthless. But there must be some things\r\nleft that we can use.\r\n\r\n\"See the post-office, down there on the left? Think of the millions in\r\nreal money, gold and silver, in all these safes here and all over the\r\ncity--in the banks and vaults! Millions! Billions!\r\n\r\n\"Jewels, diamonds, wealth simply inconceivable! Yet now a good water\r\nsupply, some bread, meat, coffee, salt, and so on, a couple of beds, a\r\ngun or two and some ordinary tools would outweigh them all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Clothes, too,\" the girl suggested. \"Plain cotton cloth is worth ten\r\nmillion dollars an inch now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" answered Stern, gazing about him with wonder.\r\n\r\n\"And I offer a bushel of diamonds for a razor and a pair of scissors.\"\r\nGrimly he smiled as he stroked his enormous beard.\r\n\r\n\"But come, this won't do. There'll be plenty of time to look around\r\nand discuss things in the morning. Just now we've got a definite\r\nerrand. Let's get busy!\"\r\n\r\nThus began their search for a few prime necessities of life, there in\r\nthat charnel-house of civilization, by the dull reflections of the\r\nfirelight and the pallid torch glow.\r\n\r\nThough they forced their way into ten or twelve of the arcade shops,\r\nthey found no clothing, no blankets or fabric of any kind that would\r\nserve for coverings or to sleep upon. Everything at all in the nature\r\nof cloth had either sunk back into moldering annihilation or had at\r\nbest grown far too fragile to be of the slightest service.\r\n\r\nThey found, however, a furrier's shop, and this they entered eagerly.\r\n\r\nFrom rusted metal hooks a few warped fragments of skins still hung,\r\nmoth-eaten, riddled with holes, ready to crumble at the merest touch.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing in any of these to help us,\" judged Stern. \"But maybe\r\nwe might find something else in here.\"\r\n\r\nCarefully they searched the littered place, all dust and horrible\r\ndisarray, which made sad mockery of the gold-leaf sign still visible\r\non the window: \"Lange, Importer. All the Latest Novelties.\"\r\n\r\nOn the floor Stern discovered three more of those little dust-middens\r\nwhich meant human bodies, pitiful remnants of an extinct race, of\r\nunknown people in the long ago. What had he now in common with them?\r\nThe remains did not even inspire repugnance in him. All at once\r\nBeatrice uttered a cry of startled gladness. \"Look here! A storage\r\nchest!\"\r\n\r\nTrue enough, there stood a cedar box, all seamed and cracked and\r\nbulging, yet still retaining a semblance of its original shape.\r\n\r\nThe copper bindings and the lock were still quite plainly to be seen,\r\nas the engineer held the torch close, though green and corroded with\r\nincredible age.\r\n\r\nOne effort of Stern's powerful arms sufficed to tip the chest quite\r\nover. As it fell it burst. Down in a mass of pulverized, worm-eaten\r\nsplinters it disintegrated.\r\n\r\nOut rolled furs, many and many of them, black, and yellow, and\r\nstriped--the pelts of the grizzly, of the leopard, the chetah, the\r\nroyal Bengal himself.\r\n\r\n\"Hurray!\" shouted the man, catching up first one, then another, and\r\nstill a third. \"Almost intact. A little imperfection here and there\r\ndoesn't matter. Now we've got clothes and beds.\r\n\r\n\"What's that? Yes, maybe they are a trifle warm for this season of the\r\nyear, but this is no time to be particular. See, now, how do you like\r\n_that?_\"\r\n\r\nOver the girl's shoulders, as he spoke, he flung the tiger-skin.\r\n\r\n\"Magnificent!\" he judged, standing back a pace or two and holding up\r\nthe torch to see her better. \"When I find you a big gold pin or clasp\r\nto fasten that with at the throat you'll make a picture of another and\r\nmore splendid Boadicea!\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to laugh at his own words, but merriment sat ill there in\r\nthat place, and with such a subject. For the woman, thus clad, had\r\nsuddenly assumed a wild, barbaric beauty.\r\n\r\nBright gleamed her gray eyes by the light of the flambeau; limpid, and\r\ndeep, and earnest, they looked at Stern. Her wonderful hair, shaken\r\nout in bewildering masses over the striped, tawny savagery of the\r\nrobe, made colorful contrasts, barbarous, seductive.\r\n\r\nHalf hidden, the woman's perfect body, beautiful as that of a\r\nwood-nymph or a pagan dryad, roused atavistic passions in the\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\nHe dared speak no other word for the moment, but bent beside the\r\nshattered chest again and fell to looking over the furs.\r\n\r\nA polar-bear skin attracted his attention, and this he chose. Then,\r\nwith it slung across his shoulder, he stood up.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said he, steadying his voice with an effort; \"come, we must be\r\ngoing now. Our light won't hold out very much longer. We've got to\r\nfind food and drink before the alcohol's all gone; got to look out for\r\npractical affairs, whatever happens. Let's be going.\"\r\n\r\nFortune favored them.\r\n\r\nIn the wreck of a small fancy grocer's booth down toward the end of\r\nthe arcade, where the post-office had been, they came upon a stock of\r\ngoods in glass jars.\r\n\r\nAll the tinned foods had long since perished, but the impermeable\r\nglass seemed to have preserved fruits and vegetables of the finer\r\nsort, and chipped beef and the like, in a state of perfect soundness.\r\n\r\nBest of all, they discovered the remains of a case of mineral water.\r\nThe case had crumbled to dust, but fourteen bottles of water were\r\nstill intact.\r\n\r\n\"Pile three or four of these into my fur robe here,\" directed Stern.\r\n\"Now, a few of the other jars--that's right. To-morrow we'll come down\r\nand clean up the whole stock. But we've got enough for now.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd best be getting back up the stairs again,\" said he. And so they\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to leave that fire burning?\" asked the girl, as they\r\npassed the middle of the arcade.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It can't do any harm. Nothing to catch here; only old metal and\r\ncement. Besides, it would take too much time and labor to put it out.\"\r\n\r\nThus they abandoned the gruesome place and began the long, exhausting\r\nclimb.\r\n\r\nIt must have taken them an hour and a half at least to reach their\r\neerie. Both found their strength taxed to the utmost.\r\n\r\nBefore they were much more than halfway up, the ultimate drop of\r\nalcohol had been burned.\r\n\r\nThe last few hundred feet had to be made by slow, laborious feeling,\r\naided only by such dim reflections of the gibbous moon as glimmered\r\nthrough a window, cobweb-hung, or through some break in the walls.\r\n\r\nAt length, however--for all things have an end--breathless and spent,\r\nthey found their refuge. And soon after that, clad in their savage\r\nrobes, they supped.\r\n\r\nAllan Stern, consulting engineer, and Beatrice Kendrick, stenographer,\r\nnow king and queen of the whole wide world domain (as they feared),\r\nsat together by a little blaze of punky wood fragments that flickered\r\non the eroded floor.\r\n\r\nThey ate with their fingers and drank out of the bottles, _sans_\r\napology. Strange were their speculations, their wonderings, their\r\nplans--now discussed specifically, now half-voiced by a mere word that\r\nthrilled them both with sudden, poignant emotion.\r\n\r\nAn so an hour passed, and the night deepened toward the birth of\r\nanother day. The fire burned low and died, for they had little to\r\nreplenish it with.\r\n\r\nDown sank the moon, her pale light dimming as she went, her faint\r\nillumination wanly creeping across the disordered, wrack-strewn floor.\r\n\r\nAnd at length Stern, in the outer office, Beatrice in the other, they\r\nwrapped themselves within their furs and laid them down to sleep.\r\n\r\nDespite the age-long trance from which they both had but so recently\r\nemerged, a strange lassitude weighed on them.\r\n\r\nYet long after Beatrice had lost herself in dreams, Stern lay and\r\nthought strange thoughts, yearning and eager thoughts, there in the\r\nimpenetrable gloom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE OUTER WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore daybreak the engineer was up again, and active. Now that\r\nhe faced the light of morning, with a thousand difficult problems\r\nclosing in on every hand, he put aside his softer moods, his visions\r\nand desires, and--like the scientific man he was--addressed himself to\r\nthe urgent matters in hand.\r\n\r\n\"The girl's safe enough alone, here, for a while,\" thought he, looking\r\nin upon her where she lay, calm as a child, folded within the clinging\r\nmasses of the tiger-skin.\r\n\r\n\"I must be out and away for two or three hours, at the very least. I\r\nhope she'll sleep till I get back. If not--what then?\"\r\n\r\nHe thought a moment; then, coming over to the charred remnants of last\r\nnight's fire, chose a bit of burnt wood. With this he scrawled in\r\nlarge, rough letters on a fairly smooth stretch of the wall:\r\n\r\n\"Back soon. All O. K. Don't worry.\"\r\n\r\nThen, turning, he set out on the long, painful descent again to the\r\nearth-level.\r\n\r\nGarish now, and doubly terrible, since seen with more than double\r\nclearness by the graying dawn, the world-ruin seemed to him.\r\n\r\nStrong of body and of nerve as he was, he could not help but shudder\r\nat the numberless traces of sudden and pitiless death which met his\r\ngaze.\r\n\r\nEverywhere lay those dust-heaps, with here or there a tooth, a ring, a\r\nbit of jewelry showing--everywhere he saw them, all the way down the\r\nstairs, in every room and office he peered into, and in the\r\ntime-ravished confusion of the arcade.\r\n\r\nBut this was scarcely the time for reflections of any sort. Life\r\ncalled, and labor, and duty; not mourning for the dead world, nor even\r\nwonder or pity at the tragedy which had so mysteriously--befallen.\r\n\r\nAnd as the man made his way over and through the universal wreckage,\r\nhe took counsel with himself.\r\n\r\n\"First of all, water!\" thought he. \"We can't depend on the bottled\r\nsupply. Of course, there's the Hudson; but it's brackish, if not\r\ndownright salt. I've got to find some fresh and pure supply, close at\r\nhand. That's the prime necessity of life.\r\n\r\n\"What with the canned stuff, and such game as I can kill, there's\r\nbound to be food enough for a while. But a good water-supply we must\r\nhave, and at once!\"\r\n\r\nYet, prudent rather for the sake of Beatrice than for his own, he\r\ndecided that he ought not to issue out, unarmed, into this new and\r\nsavage world, of which he had as yet no very definite knowledge. And\r\nfor a while he searched hoping to find some weapon or other.\r\n\r\n\"I've got to have an ax, first of all,\" said he. \"That's mans first\r\nneed, in any wilderness. Where shall I find one?\"\r\n\r\nHe thought a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! In the basements!\" exclaimed he. \"Maybe I can locate an\r\nengine-room, a store-room, or something of that sort. There's sure to\r\nbe tools in a place like that.\" And, laying off the bear-skin, he\r\nprepared to explore the regions under the ground-level.\r\n\r\nHe used more than half an hour, through devious ways and hard labor,\r\nto make his way to the desired spot. The ancient stair-way, leading\r\ndown, he could not find.\r\n\r\nBut by clambering down one of the elevator-shafts, digging toes and\r\nfingers into the crevices in the metal framework and the cracks in the\r\nconcrete, he managed at last to reach a vaulted sub-cellar, festooned\r\nwith webs, damp, noisome and obscure.\r\n\r\nConsiderable light glimmered in from a broken sidewalk-grating above,\r\nand through a gaping, jagged hole near one end of the cellar, beneath\r\nwhich lay a badly-broken stone.\r\n\r\nThe engineer figured that this block had fallen from the tower and\r\ncome to rest only here; and this awoke him to a new sense of\r\never-present peril. At any moment of the night or day, he realized,\r\nsome such mishap was imminent.\r\n\r\n\"Eternal vigilance!\" he whispered to himself. Then, dismissing useless\r\nfears, he set about the task in hand.\r\n\r\nBy the dim illumination from above, he was able to take cognizance of\r\nthe musty-smelling place, which, on the whole, was in a better state\r\nof repair than the arcade. The first cellar yielded nothing of value\r\nto him, but, making his way through a low vaulted door, he chanced\r\ninto what must have been one of the smaller, auxiliary engine-rooms.\r\n\r\nThis, he found, contained a battery of four dynamos, a small\r\nseepage-pump, and a crumbling marble switch-board with part of the\r\nwiring still comparatively intact.\r\n\r\nAt sight of all this valuable machinery scaled and pitted with rust,\r\nStern's brows contracted with a feeling akin to pain. The engineer\r\nloved mechanism of all sorts; its care and use had been his life.\r\n\r\nAnd now these mournful relics, strange as that may seem, affected him\r\nmore strongly than the little heaps of dust which marked the spots\r\nwhere human beings had fallen in sudden, inescapable death.\r\n\r\nYet even so, he had no time for musing.\r\n\r\n\"Tools!\" cried he, peering about the dimwit vault. \"Tools--I must have\r\nsome. Till I find tools, I'm helpless!\"\r\n\r\nSearch as he might, he discovered no ax in the place, but in place of\r\nit he unearthed a sledge-hammer. Though corroded, it was still quite\r\nserviceable. Oddly enough, the oak handle was almost intact.\r\n\r\n\"Kyanized wood, probably,\" reflected he, as he laid the sledge to one\r\nside and began delving into a bed of dust that had evidently been a\r\nwork-bench. \"Ah! And here's a chisel! A spanner, too! A heap of rusty\r\nold wire nails!\"\r\n\r\nDelightedly he examined these treasures.\r\n\r\n\"They're worth more to me,\" he exulted; \"than all the gold between\r\nhere and what's left of San Francisco!\"\r\n\r\nHe found nothing more of value in the litter. Everything else was\r\nrusted beyond use. So, having convinced himself that nothing more\r\nremained, he gathered up his finds and started back whence he had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nAfter some quarter-hour of hard labor, he managed to transport\r\neverything up into the arcade.\r\n\r\n\"Now for a glimpse of the outer world!\" quoth he.\r\n\r\nGripping the sledge well in hand, he made his way through the confused\r\nnexus of ruin. Disguised as everything now was, fallen and disjointed,\r\nmurdering, blighted by age incalculable, still the man recognized many\r\nfamiliar features.\r\n\r\nHere, he recalled, the telephone-booths had been; there the\r\ninformation desk. Yonder, again, he remembered the little curved\r\ncounter where once upon a time a man in uniform had sold tickets to\r\nsuch as had wanted to visit the tower.\r\n\r\nCounter now was dust; ticket-man only a crumble of fine, grayish\r\npowder. Stern shivered slightly, and pressed on.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the outer air, he noticed that many a grassy tuft and\r\ncreeping vine had rooted in the pavement of the arcade, up-prying the\r\nmarble slabs and cracking the once magnificent floor.\r\n\r\nThe doorway itself was almost choked by a tremendous Norway pine which\r\nhad struck root close to the building, and now insolently blocked that\r\nway where, other-time many thousand men and women every day had come\r\nand gone.\r\n\r\nBut Stern clambered out past this obstacle, testing the floor with his\r\nsledge, as he went, lest he fall through an unseen weak spots into the\r\ndepths of coal-cellars below. And presently he reached the outer air,\r\nunharmed.\r\n\r\n\"But--but, the sidewalk?\" cried he, amazed. \"The street--the Square?\r\nWhere are they?\" And in astonishment he stopped, staring.\r\n\r\nThe view from the tower, though it had told him something of the\r\nchanges wrought, had given him no adequate conception of their\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nHe had expected some remains of human life to show upon the earth,\r\nsome semblance of the metropolis to remain in the street. But no,\r\nnothing was there; nothing at all on the ground to show that he was in\r\nthe heart of a city.\r\n\r\nHe could, indeed, catch glimpses of a building here or there. Through\r\nthe tangled thickets that grew close up to the age-worn walls of the\r\nMetropolitan, he could make out a few bits of tottering construction\r\non the south side of what had been Twenty-Third Street.\r\n\r\nBut of the street itself, no trace remained--no pavement, no sidewalk,\r\nno curb. And even so near and so conspicuous an object as the wreck of\r\nthe Flatiron was now entirely concealed by the dense forest.\r\n\r\nSoil had formed thickly over all the surface. Huge oaks and pines\r\nflourished there as confidently as though in the heart of the Maine\r\nforest, crowding ash and beech for room.\r\n\r\nUnder the man's feet, even as he stood close by the building--which\r\nwas thickly overgrown with ivy and with ferns and bushes rooted in the\r\ncrannies--the pine-needles bent in deep, pungent beds.\r\n\r\nBirch, maple, poplar and all the natives of the American woods\r\nshouldered each other lustily. By the state of the fresh young leaves,\r\njust bursting their sheaths, Stern knew the season was mid-May.\r\n\r\nThrough the wind-swayed branches, little flickering patches of morning\r\nsunlight met his gaze, as they played and quivered on the forest moss\r\nor over the sere pine-spills.\r\n\r\nEven upon the huge, squared stones which here and there lay in\r\ndisorder, and which Stern knew must have fallen from the tower, the\r\nmoss grew very thick; and more than one such block had been rent by\r\nfrost and growing things.\r\n\r\n\"How long has it been, great Heavens! How long?\" cried the engineer, a\r\nsudden fear creeping into his heart. For this, the reasserted\r\ndominance of nature, bore in on him with more appalling force than\r\nanything he had yet seen.\r\n\r\nAbout him he looked, trying to get his bearings in that strange\r\nmilieu.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said he, quite slowly, \"it's--it's just as though some cosmic\r\njester, all-powerful, had scooped up the fragments of a ruined city\r\nand tossed them pell-mell into the core of the Adirondacks! It's\r\nhorrible--ghastly--incredible!\"\r\n\r\nDazed and awed, he stood as in a dream, a strange figure with his mane\r\nof hair, his flaming, trailing beard, his rags (for he had left the\r\nbear-skin in the arcade), his muscular arm, knotted as he held the\r\nsledge over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nWell might he have been a savage of old times; one of the early\r\nbarbarians of Britain, perhaps, peering in wonder at the ruins of some\r\ndeserted Roman camp.\r\n\r\nThe chatter of a squirrel high up somewhere in the branches of an oak,\r\nrecalled him to his wits. Down came spiralling a few bits of bark and\r\nacorn-shell, quite in the old familiar way.\r\n\r\nFarther off among the woods, a robin's throaty morning notes drifted\r\nto him on the odorous breeze. A wren, surprisingly tame, chippered\r\nbusily. It hopped about, not ten feet from him, entirely fearless.\r\n\r\nStern realized that it was now seeing a man for the first time in its\r\nlife, and that it had no fear. His bushy brows contracted as he\r\nwatched the little brown body jumping from twig to twig in the pine\r\nabove him.\r\n\r\nA deep, full breath he drew. Higher, still higher he raised his head.\r\nFar through the leafy screen he saw the overbending arch of sky in\r\ntiny patches of turquoise.\r\n\r\n\"The same old world, after all--the same, in spite of\r\neverything--thank God!\" he whispered, his very tone a prayer of\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly, though why he could not have told, the grim engineer's\r\neyes grew wet with tears that ran, unheeded, down his heavy-bearded\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA SIGN OF PERIL\r\n\r\n\r\nStern's weakness--as he judged it--lasted but a minute. Then,\r\nrealizing even more fully than ever the necessity for immediate labor\r\nand exploration, he tightened his grip upon the sledge and set forth\r\ninto the forest of Madison Square.\r\n\r\nAway from him scurried a cotton-tail. A snake slid, hissing, out of\r\nsight under a jungle of fern. A butterfly, dull brown and ocher,\r\nsettled upon a branch in the sunlight, where it began slowly opening\r\nand shutting its wings.\r\n\r\n\"Hem! That's a _Danaus plexippus_, right enough,\" commented the man.\r\n\"But there are some odd changes in it. Yes, indeed, certainly some\r\nevolutionary variants. Must be a tremendous time since we went to\r\nsleep, for sure; probably very much longer than I dare guess. That's a\r\nproblem I've got to go to work on, before many days!\"\r\n\r\nBut now for the present he dismissed it again; he pushed it aside in\r\nthe press of urgent matters. And, parting the undergrowth, he broke\r\nhis crackling way through the deep wood.\r\n\r\nHe had gone but a few hundred yards when an exclamation of surprised\r\ndelight burst from his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Water! Water!\" he cried. \"What? A spring, so close? A pool, right\r\nhere at hand? Good luck, by Jove, the very first thing!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, stopping where he stood, he gazed at it with keen, unalloyed\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nThere, so near to the massive bulk of the tower that the vast shadow\r\nlay broadly across it, Stern had suddenly come upon as beautiful a\r\nlittle watercourse as ever bubbled forth under the yews of Arden or\r\nlapped the willows of Hesperides.\r\n\r\nHe beheld a roughly circular depression in the woods, fern-banked and\r\nfringed with purple blooms; at the bottom sparkled a spring,\r\nleaf-bowered, cool, Elysian.\r\n\r\nFrom this, down through a channel which the water must have worn for\r\nitself by slow erosion, a small brook trickled, widening out into a\r\npool some fifteen feet across; whence, brimming over, it purled away\r\nthrough the young sweet-flags and rushes with tempting little woodland\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\n\"What a find!\" cried the engineer. Forward he strode. \"So, then?\r\nDeer-tracks?\" he exclaimed, noting a few dainty hoof-prints in the\r\nsandy margin. \"Great!\" And, filled with exultation, he dropped beside\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\nOver it he bent. Setting his bearded lips to the sweet water, he drank\r\nenormous, satisfying drafts.\r\n\r\nSated at last, he stood up again and peered about him. All at once he\r\nburst out into joyous laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Why, this is certainly an old friend of mine, or I'm a liar!\" he\r\ncried out. \"This spring is nothing more or less than the lineal\r\ndescendant of Madison Square fountain, what? But good Lord, what a\r\nchange!\r\n\r\n\"It would make a splendid subject for an article in the 'Annals of\r\nApplied Geology.' Only--well, there aren't any annals, now, and what's\r\nmore, no readers!\"\r\n\r\nDown to the wider pool he walked.\r\n\r\n\"Stern, my boy,\" said he, \"here's where you get an A-1, first-class\r\ndip!\"\r\n\r\nA minute later, stripped to the buff, the man lay splashing vigorously\r\nin the water. From top to toe he scrubbed himself vigorously with the\r\nfine, white sand. And when, some minutes later, he rose up again, the\r\ntingle and joy of life filled him in every nerve.\r\n\r\nFor a minute he looked contemptuously at his rags, lying there on the\r\nedge of the pool. Then with a grunt he kicked them aside.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we'll dispense with those,\" judged he. \"The bear-skin, back\r\nin the building, there, will be enough.\" He picked up his sledge, and,\r\nheaving a mighty breath of comfort, set out for the tower again.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but that was certainly fine!\" he exclaimed. \"I feel ten years\r\nyounger, already. Ten, from what? X minus ten, equals--?\"\r\n\r\nThoughtfully, as he walked across the elastic moss and over the\r\npine-needles, he stroked his beard.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if I could only get a hair-cut and shave!\" said he. \"Well, why\r\nnot? Wouldn't that surprise _her_, though?\"\r\n\r\nThe idea strong upon him, he hastened his steps, and soon was back at\r\nthe door close to the huge Norway pine. But here he did not enter.\r\nInstead, he turned to the right.\r\n\r\nPlowing through the woods, climbing over fallen columns and shattered\r\nbuilding-stones, flushing a covey of loud-winged partridges, parting\r\nthe bushes that grew thickly along the base of the wall, he now found\r\nhimself in what had long ago been Twenty-Third Street.\r\n\r\nNo sign, now of paving or car-tracks--nothing save, on the other side\r\nof the way, crumbling lines of ruin. As he worked his way among the\r\ndetritus of the Metropolitan, he kept sharp watch for the wreckage of\r\na hardware store.\r\n\r\nNot until he had crossed the ancient line of Madison Avenue and\r\npenetrated some hundred yards still further along Twenty-Third Street,\r\ndid he find what he sought. \"Ah!\" he suddenly cried. \"Here's something\r\nnow!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, scrambling over a pile of grass-grown rubbish with a couple of\r\ntime-bitten iron wheels peering out--evidently the wreckage of an\r\nelectric car--he made his way around a gaping hole where a side-walk\r\nhad caved in and so reached the interior of a shop.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, prospects here, certainly prospects!\" he decided carefully\r\ninspecting the place. \"If this didn't use to be Currier & Brown's\r\nplace, I'm away off my bearings. There ought to be _something_ left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Would you?\" and he flung a hastily-snatched rock at a rattlesnake\r\nthat had begun its dry, chirring defiance on top of what once had been\r\na counter.\r\n\r\nThe snake vanished, while the rock rebounding, crashed through glass.\r\n\r\nStern wheeled about with a cry of joy. For there, he saw, still stood\r\nnear the back of the shop a showcase from within which he caught a\r\nsheen of tarnished metal.\r\n\r\nQuickly he ran toward this, stumbling over the loose dooring, mossy\r\nand grass-grown. There in the case, preserved as you have seen\r\nEgyptian relics two or three thousand years old, in museums, the\r\nengineer beheld incalculable treasures. He thrilled with a savage,\r\nstrange delight.\r\n\r\nAnother blow, with the sledge, demolished the remaining glass.\r\n\r\nHe trembled with excitement as he chose what he most needed.\r\n\r\n\"I certainly do understand now,\" said he, \"why the New Zealanders took\r\nCaptain Cook's old barrel-hoops and refused his cash. Same here! All\r\nthe money in this town couldn't buy this rusty knife--\" as he seized a\r\ncorroded blade set in a horn handle, yellowed with age. And eagerly he\r\ncontinued the hunt.\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes later he had accumulated a pair of scissors, two\r\nrubber combs, another knife, a revolver, an automatic, several\r\nhandfuls of cartridges and a Cosmos bottle.\r\n\r\nAll these he stowed in a warped, mildewed remnant of a Gladstone bag,\r\ntaken from a corner where a broken glass sign, \"Leather Goods,\" lay\r\namong the rank confusion.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I've got enough, now, for the first load,\" he judged, more\r\nexcited than if he had chanced upon a blue-clay bed crammed with\r\nCullinan diamonds. \"It's a beginning, anyhow. Now for Beatrice!\"\r\n\r\nJoyously as a schoolboy with a pocketful of new-won marbles, he made\r\nhis exit from the ruins of the hardware store, and started back toward\r\nthe tower.\r\n\r\nBut hardly had he gone a hundred feet when all at once he drew back\r\nwith a sharp cry of wonder and alarm.\r\n\r\nThere at his feet, in plain view under a little maple sapling, lay\r\nsomething that held him frozen with astonishment.\r\n\r\nHe snatched it up, dropping the sledge to do so.\r\n\r\n\"What? _What?_\" he stammered; and at the thing he stared with widened,\r\nuncomprehending eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful God! How--what--?\" cried he.\r\n\r\nThe thing he held in his hand was a broad, fat, flint assegai-point!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nHEADWAY AGAINST ODDS\r\n\r\n\r\nStern gazed at this alarming object with far more trepidation\r\nthan he would have eyed a token authentically labeled: \"Direct from\r\nMars.\"\r\n\r\nFor the space of a full half-minute he found no word, grasped no\r\ncoherent thought, came to no action save to stand there,\r\nthunder-struck, holding the rotten leather bag in one hand, the\r\nspear-head in the other.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, he shouted a curse and made as though to fling it\r\nclean away. But ere it had left his grasp, he checked himself.\r\n\r\n\"No, there's no use in _that_,\" said he, quite slowly. \"If this thing\r\nis what it appears to be, if it isn't merely some freakish bit of\r\nstone weathered off somewhere, why, it means--my God, what _doesn't_\r\nit mean?\"\r\n\r\nHe shuddered, and glanced fearfully about him; all his calculations\r\nalready seemed crashing down about him; all his plans, half-formulated,\r\nappeared in ruin.\r\n\r\nNew, vast and unknown factors of the struggle broadened rapidly before\r\nhis mental vision, _if_ this thing were really what it looked to be.\r\n\r\nKeenly he peered at the bit of flint in his palm. There it lay, real\r\nenough, an almost perfect specimen of the flaker's art, showing\r\ndistinctly where the wood had been applied to the core to peel off the\r\nmany successive layers.\r\n\r\nIt could not have been above three and a half inches long, by one and\r\na quarter wide, at its broadest part. The heft, where it had been\r\nhollowed to hold the lashings, was well marked.\r\n\r\nA diminutive object and a skilfully-formed one. At any other time or\r\nplace, the engineer would have considered the finding a good fortune;\r\nbut now--!\r\n\r\n\"Yet after all,\" he said aloud, as if to convince himself, \"it's only\r\na bit of stone! What can it prove?\"\r\n\r\nHis subconsciousness seemed to make answer: \"So, too, the sign that\r\nRobinson Crusoe found on the beach was only a human foot-mark. Do not\r\ndeceive yourself!\"\r\n\r\nIn deep thought the engineer stood there a moment or two. Then, \"Bah!\"\r\ncried he. \"What does it matter, anyhow? Let it come--whatever it is!\r\nIf I hadn't just happened to find this, I'd have been none the wiser.\"\r\nAnd he dropped the bit of flint into the bag along with the other\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nAgain he picked up his sledge, and, now more cautiously, once more\r\nstarted forward.\r\n\r\n\"All I can do,\" he thought, \"is just to go right ahead as though this\r\nhadn't happened at all. If trouble comes, it comes, that's all. I\r\nguess I can meet it. Always _have_ got away with it, so far. We'll\r\nsee. What's on the cards has got to be played to a finish, and the\r\nbest hand wins!\"\r\n\r\nHe retraced his way to the spring, where he carefully rinsed and\r\nfilled the Cosmos bottle for Beatrice. Then back to the Metropolitan\r\nhe came, donned his bear--skin, which he fastened with a wire nail,\r\nand started the long climb. His sledge he carefully hid on the second\r\nfloor, in an office at the left of the stairway.\r\n\r\n\"Don't think much of this hammer, after all,\" said he. \"What I need is\r\nan ax. Perhaps this afternoon I can have another go at that hardware\r\nplace and find one.\r\n\r\n\"If the handle's gone, I can heft it with green wood. With a good ax\r\nand these two revolvers--till I find some rifles--I guess we're safe\r\nenough, spearheads or not!\"\r\n\r\nAbout him he glanced at the ever-present molder and decay. This\r\noffice, he could easily see, had been both spacious and luxurious, but\r\nnow it offered a sorry spectacle. In the dust over by a window\r\nsomething glittered dully.\r\n\r\nStern found it was a fragment of a beveled mirror, which had probably\r\nhung there and, when the frame rotted, had dropped. He brushed it off\r\nand looked eagerly into it.\r\n\r\nA cry of amazement burst from him.\r\n\r\n\"Do I look like _that?_\" he shouted. \"Well, I won't, for long!\"\r\n\r\nHe propped the glass up on the steel beam of the window-opening, and\r\ngot the scissors out of the bag. Ten minutes later, the face of Allan\r\nStern bore some resemblance to its original self. True enough, his\r\nhair remained a bit jagged, especially in the back, his brows were\r\nsomewhat uneven, and the point to which his beard was trimmed was far\r\nfrom perfect.\r\n\r\nBut none the less his wild savagery had given place to a certain\r\naspect of civilization that made the white bearskin over his shoulders\r\nlook doubly strange.\r\n\r\nStern, however, was well pleased. He smiled in satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"What will _she_ think, and say?\" he wondered, as he once more took up\r\nthe bag and started on the long, exhausting climb.\r\n\r\nSweating profusely, badly \"blown,\"--for he had not taken much time to\r\nrest on the way--the engineer at last reached his offices in the\r\ntower.\r\n\r\nBefore entering, he called the girl's name.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! Oh, Beatrice! Are you awake, and visible?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, come in!\" she answered cheerfully, and came to meet him in\r\nthe doorway. Out to him she stretched her hand, in welcome; and the\r\nsmile she gave him set his heart pounding.\r\n\r\nHe had to laugh at her astonishment and naive delight over his changed\r\nappearance; but all the time his eyes were eagerly devouring her\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nFor now, freshly-awakened, full of new life and vigor after a sound\r\nnight's sleep, the girl was magnificent.\r\n\r\nThe morning light disclosed new glints of color in her wondrous hair,\r\nas it lay broad and silken on the tiger-skin.\r\n\r\nThis she had secured at the throat and waist with bits of metal taken\r\nfrom the wreckage of the filing-cabinet.\r\n\r\nStern promised himself that ere long he would find her a profusion of\r\ngold pins and chains, in some of the Fifth Avenue shops, to serve her\r\npurposes till she could fashion real clothing.\r\n\r\nAs she gave him her hand, the Bengal skin fell back from her round,\r\nwarm, cream-white arm.\r\n\r\nAt sight of it, at vision of that messy crown of hair and of those\r\ngray, penetrant, questioning eyes, the man's spent breath quickened.\r\n\r\nHe turned his own eyes quickly away, lest she should read his thought,\r\nand began speaking--of what? He hardly knew. Anything, till he could\r\nmaster himself.\r\n\r\nBut through it all he knew that in his whole life, till now\r\nself-centered, analytical, cold, he never had felt such real,\r\nspontaneous happiness.\r\n\r\nThe touch of her fingers, soft and warm, dispelled his every anxiety.\r\nThe thought that he was working, now, for her; serving her; striving\r\nto preserve and keep her, thrilled him with joy.\r\n\r\nAnd as some foregleam of the future came to him, his fears dropped\r\nfrom him like those outworn rags he had discarded in the forest.\r\n\r\n\"Well, so we're both up and at it, again,\" he exclaimed,\r\ncommon-placely enough, his voice a bit uncertain. Stern had walked\r\nnarrow girders six hundred feet sheer up; he had worked in caissons\r\nunder tide-water, with the air-pumps driving full tilt to keep death\r\nout.\r\n\r\nHe had swung in a bosun's-chair down the face of the Yosemite Canyon\r\nat Cathedral Spires. But never had he felt emotions such as now. And\r\ngreatly he marveled.\r\n\r\n\"I've had luck,\" he continued. \"See here, and here?\"\r\n\r\nHe showed her his treasures, all the contents of the bag, except the\r\nspear-point. Then, giving her the Cosmos bottle, he bade her drink.\r\nGratefully she did so, while he explained to her the finding of the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nHer face aglow with eagerness and brave enthusiasts, she listened. But\r\nwhen he told her about the bathing-pool, an envious expression came to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"It's not fair,\" she protested, \"for you to monopolize that. If you'll\r\nshow me the place--and just stay around in the woods, to see that\r\nnothing hurts me--\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll take a dip, too?\"\r\n\r\nEagerly she nodded, her eyes beaming.\r\n\r\n\"I'm just dying for one!\" she exclaimed. \"Think! I haven't had a bath,\r\nnow, for _x_ years!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm at your service,\" declared the engineer. And for a moment a\r\nlittle silence came between them, a silence so profound that they\r\ncould even hear the faint, far cheepings of the mud-swallows in the\r\ntower stair, above.\r\n\r\nAt the back of Stern's brain still lurked a haunting fear of the wood,\r\nof what the assegai-point might portend, but he dispelled it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, come along down,\" bade he. \"It's getting late, already. But\r\nfirst, we must take just one more look, by this fresh morning light,\r\nfrom the platform up above, there?\"\r\n\r\nShe assented readily. Together, talking of their first urgent needs,\r\nof their plans for this new day and for this wonderful, strange life\r\nthat now confronted them, they climbed the stairs again. Once more\r\nthey issued out on to the weed-grown platform of red tiles.\r\n\r\nThere they stood a moment, looking out with wonder over that vast,\r\nstill, marvelous prospect of life-in-death. Suddenly the engineer\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" said he, \"where did you get that line of verse you quoted\r\nlast night? The one about this vast city--heart all lying still, you\r\nknow?\"\r\n\r\n\"That? Why, that was from Wordsworth's Sonnet on London Bridge, of\r\ncourse,\" she smiled up at him. \"You remember it now, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No-o,\" he disclaimed a trifle dubiously. \"I--that is, I never was\r\nmuch on poetry, you understand. It wasn't exactly in my line. But\r\nnever mind. How did it go? I'd like to hear it, tremendously.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't just recall the whole poem,\" she answered thoughtfully. \"But\r\nI know part of it ran:\r\n\r\n  '......This city now doth like a garment wear\r\n  The beauty of the morning. Silent, bare,\r\n    Ships, towers, domes, theaters, and temples lie\r\n    Open unto the fields and to the sky\r\n  All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.'\"\r\n\r\nA moment she paused to think. The sun, lancing its long and level rays\r\nacross the water and the vast dead city, irradiated her face.\r\n\r\nInstinctively, as she looked abroad over that wondrous panorama, she\r\nraised both bare arms; and, clad in the tiger-skin alone, stood for a\r\nlittle space like some Parsee priestess, sun-worshiping, on her tower\r\nof silence.\r\n\r\nStern looked at her, amazed.\r\n\r\nWas this, could this indeed be the girl he had employed, in the old\r\ndays--the other days of routine and of tedium, of orders and\r\nspecifications and dry-as-dust dictation? As though from a strange\r\nspell he aroused himself.\r\n\r\n\"The poem?\" exclaimed he. \"What next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that? I'd almost forgotten about that; I was dreaming. It goes\r\nthis way, I think:\r\n\r\n  'Never did the sun more beautifully steep\r\n    In his first splendor valley, rock, or hill,\r\n  Ne'er saw I, never felt a calm so deep;\r\n    The river glideth at his own sweet will.\r\n  Dear God! the very houses seem asleep,\r\n    And all this mighty heart is standing still!......'\"\r\n\r\nShe finished the tremendous classic almost in a whisper.\r\n\r\nThey both stood silent a moment, gazing out together on that strange,\r\ninexplicable fulfilment of the poet's vision.\r\n\r\nUp to them, through the crystal morning air, rose a faint, small sound\r\nof waters, from the brooklet in the forest. The nesting birds, below,\r\nwere busy \"in song and solace\"; and through the golden sky above, a\r\nswallow slanted on sharp wing toward some unseen, leafy goal.\r\n\r\nFar out upon the river, faint specks of white wheeled and hovered--a\r\nflock of swooping gulls, snowy and beautiful and free. Their pinions\r\nflashed, spiralled and sank to rest on the wide waters.\r\n\r\nStern breathed a sigh. His right arm slipped about the sinuous,\r\nfur-robed body of the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Come, now!\" said he, with returning practicality. \"Bath for you,\r\nbreakfast for both of us--then we must buckle down to work. _Come!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTERROR\r\n\r\n\r\nNoon found them far advanced in the preliminaries of their hard\r\nadventuring.\r\n\r\nWorking together in a strong and frank companionship--the past\r\ntemporarily forgotten and the future still put far away--half a day's\r\nlabor advanced them a long distance on the road to safety.\r\n\r\nEven these few hours sufficed to prove that, unless some strange,\r\nuntoward accident befell, they stood a more than equal chance of\r\nwinning out.\r\n\r\nRealizing to begin with, that a home on the forty-eighth story of the\r\ntower was entirely impractical, since it would mean that most of their\r\ntime would have to be used in laborious climbing, they quickly changed\r\ntheir dwelling.\r\n\r\nThey chose a suite of offices on the fifth floor, looking directly out\r\nover and into the cool green beauty of Madison Forest. In an hour or\r\nso, they cleared out the bats and spiders, the rubbish and the dust,\r\nand made the place very decently presentable.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's a good beginning, anyhow,\" remarked the engineer,\r\nstanding back and looking critically at the finished work.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why we shouldn't make a fairly comfortable home out of\r\nthis, for a while. It's not too high for ease, and it's high enough\r\nfor safety--to keep prowling bears and wolves and--and other things\r\nfrom exploring us in the night.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed, but memories of the spear-head tinged his merriment with\r\napprehension. \"In a day or two I'll make some kind of an outer door,\r\nor barricade. But first, I need that ax and some other things. Can you\r\nspare me for a while, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd _rather_ go along, too,\" she answered wistfully, from the\r\nwindow-sill where she sat resting.\r\n\r\n\"No, not this time, please!\" he entreated. \"First I've got to go 'way\r\nto the top of the tower and bring down my chemicals and all the other\r\nthings up there.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm going out on a hunt for dishes, a lamp, some oil and no end\r\nof things. You save your strength for a while; stay here and keep\r\nhouse and be a good girl!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" she acceded, smiling a little sadly. \"But really, I feel\r\nquite able to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"This afternoon, perhaps; not now. Good-by!\" And he started for the\r\ndoor. Then a thought struck him. He turned and came back.\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" said he, \"if we can fix up some kind of a holster, I'll\r\ntake one of those revolvers. With the best of this leather here,\"\r\nnodding at the Gladstone bag, \"I should imagine we could manufacture\r\nsomething serviceable.\"\r\n\r\nThey planned the holster together, and he cut it out with his knife,\r\nwhile she slit leather thongs to lash it with. Presently it was done,\r\nand a strap to tie it round his waist with--a crude, rough thing, but\r\njust as useful as though finished with the utmost skill.\r\n\r\n\"We'll make another for you when I get home this noon,\" he remarked\r\npicking up the automatic and a handful of cartridges. Quickly he\r\nfilled the magazine. The shells were green with verdigris, and many a\r\nrust-spot disfigured the one-time brightness of the arm.\r\n\r\nAs he stepped over to the window, aimed and pulled the trigger, a\r\nsharp and welcome report burst from the weapon. And a few leaves,\r\nclipped from an oak in the forest, zigzagged down in the bright, warm\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\n\"I guess she'll do all right!\" he laughed, sliding the ugly weapon\r\ninto his new holster. \"You see, the powder and fulminate, sealed up in\r\nthe cartridges, are practically imperishable. Here, let me load yours,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\"If you want something to do, you can practice on that dead limb out\r\nthere, see? And don't be afraid of wasting ammunition. There must be\r\nmillions of cartridges in this old burg--millions--all ours!\"\r\n\r\nAgain he laughed, and handing her the other pistol, now fully loaded,\r\ntook his leave. Before he had climbed a hundred feet up the tower\r\nstair, he heard a slow, uneven pop--pop--popping, and with\r\nsatisfaction knew that Beatrice was already perfecting herself in the\r\nuse of the revolver.\r\n\r\n\"And she may need it, too--we both may, badly--before we know it!\"\r\nthought he, frowning, as he kept upon his way.\r\n\r\nThis reflection weighed in so heavily upon him, all due to the flint\r\nassegai-point, that he made still another excuse that afternoon and so\r\ngot out of taking the girl into the forest with him on his exploring\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nThe excuse was all the more plausible inasmuch as he left her enough\r\nwork at home to do, making some real clothing and some sandals for\r\nthem both. This task, now that the girl had scissors to use, was not\r\ntoo hard.\r\n\r\nStern brought her great armfuls of the furs from the shop in the\r\narcade, and left her busily and happily employed.\r\n\r\nHe spent the afternoon in scouting through the entire neighborhood\r\nfrom Sixth Avenue as far east as Third and from Twenty-Seventh Street\r\ndown through Union Square.\r\n\r\nRevolver in his left hand, knife in his right to cut away troublesome\r\nbush or brambles, or to slit impeding vine-masses, he progressed\r\nslowly and observantly.\r\n\r\nHe kept his eyes open for big game, but--though he found moose-tracks\r\nat the corner of Broadway and Nineteenth--he ran into nothing more\r\nformidable than a lynx which snarled at him from a tree overhanging\r\nthe mournful ruins of the Farragut monument.\r\n\r\nOne shot sent it bounding and screaming with pain, out of view. Stern\r\nnoted with satisfaction that blood followed its trail.\r\n\r\n\"Guess I haven't forgotten how to shoot in all these _x_ years!\" he\r\ncommented, stooping to examine the spoor. \"That may come in handy\r\nlater!\"\r\n\r\nThen, still wary and watchful, he continued his exploration.\r\n\r\nHe found that the city, as such, had entirely ceased to be.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but lines and monstrous rubbish-heaps of ruins,\" he sized up\r\nthe situation, \"traversed by lanes of forest and overgrown with every\r\nsort of vegetation.\r\n\r\n\"Every wooden building completely wiped out. Brick and stone ones\r\npractically gone. Steel alone standing, and _that_ in rotten shape.\r\nNothing at all intact but the few concrete structures.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha!\" And he laughed satirically. \"If the builders of the\r\ntwentieth century could have foreseen this they wouldn't have thrown\r\nquite such a chest, eh? And _they_ talked of engineering!\"\r\n\r\nUseless though it was, he felt a certain pride in noting that the\r\nOsterhaut Building, on Seventeenth Street, had lasted rather better\r\nthan the average.\r\n\r\n\"_My_ work!\" said he, nodding with grim satisfaction, then passed on.\r\n\r\nInto the Subway he penetrated at Eighteenth Street, climbing with\r\ndifficulty down the choked stairway, through bushes and over masses of\r\nruin that had fallen from the roof. The great tube, he saw, was choked\r\nwith litter.\r\n\r\nSlimy and damp it was, with a mephitic smell and ugly pools of water\r\nsettled in the ancient road-bed. The rails were wholly gone in places.\r\nIn others only rotten fragments of steel remained.\r\n\r\nA goggle-eyed toad stared impudently at him from a long tangle of\r\nrubbish that had been a train--stalled there forever by the final\r\nblock-signal of death.\r\n\r\nThrough the broken arches overhead the rain and storms of ages had\r\nbeaten down, and lush grasses flourished here and there, where\r\nsunlight could penetrate.\r\n\r\nNo human dust-heaps here, as in the shelter of the arcade. Long since\r\nevery vestige of man had been swept away. Stern shuddered, more\r\ndepressed by the sight here than at any other place so far visited.\r\n\r\n\"And they boasted of a work for all time!\" whispered he, awed by the\r\nhorror of it. \"They boasted--like the financiers, the churchmen, the\r\nmerchants, everybody! Boasted of their institutions, their city, their\r\ncountry. And _now_--\"\r\n\r\nOut he clambered presently, terribly depressed by what he had\r\nwitnessed, and set to work laying in still more supplies from the\r\nwrecked shops. Now for the first time, his wonder and astonishment\r\nhaving largely abated, he began to feel the horror of this loneliness.\r\n\r\n\"No life here! Nobody to speak to--except the girl...\" he exclaimed\r\naloud, the sound of his own voice uncanny in that woodland street of\r\ndeath. \"All gone, everything! My Heavens, suppose I didn't have _her?_\r\nHow long could I go on alone, and keep my mind?\"\r\n\r\nThe thought terrified him. He put it resolutely away and went to work.\r\nWherever he stumbled upon anything of value he eagerly seized it.\r\n\r\nThe labor, he found, kept him from the subconscious dread of what\r\nmight happen to Beatrice or to himself if either should meet with any\r\nmishap. The consequences of either one dying, he knew, must be\r\nhorrible beyond all thinking for the survivor.\r\n\r\nUp Broadway he found much to keep--things which he garnered in the\r\nup-caught hem of his bearskin, things of all kinds and uses. He found\r\na clay pipe--all the wooden ones had vanished from the shop--and a\r\nglass jar of tobacco.\r\n\r\nThese he took as priceless treasures. More jars of edibles he\r\ndiscovered, also a stock of rare wines. Coffee and salt he came upon.\r\nIn the ruins of the little French brass-ware shop, opposite the\r\nFlatiron, he made a rich haul of cups and plates and a still\r\nserviceable lamp.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, it still had oil in it. The fluid hermetically\r\nsealed in, had not been able to evaporate.\r\n\r\nAt last, when the lengthening shadows in Madison Forest warned him\r\nthat day was ending, he betook himself, heavy laden, once more back\r\npast the spring, and so through the path which already was beginning\r\nto be visible back to the shelter of the Metropolitan.\r\n\r\n\"Now for a great surprise for the girl!\" thought he, laboriously\r\ntoiling up the stair with his burden: \"What will she say, I wonder,\r\nwhen she sees all these housekeeping treasures?\" Eagerly he hastened.\r\n\r\nBut before he had reached the third story he heard a cry from above.\r\nThen a spatter of revolver-shots punctured the air.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, listening in alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! Oh, Beatrice!\" he hailed, his voice falling flat and\r\nstifled in those ruinous passages.\r\n\r\nAnother shot.\r\n\r\n\"Answer!\" panted Stern. \"What's the matter _now?_\"\r\n\r\nHastily he put down his burden, and, spurred by a great terror,\r\nbounded up the broken stairs.\r\n\r\nInto their little shelter, their home, he ran, calling her name.\r\n\r\nNo reply came!\r\n\r\nStern stopped short, his face a livid gray.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Heaven!\" stammered he.\r\n\r\n_The girl was gone!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nA THOUSAND YEARS!\r\n\r\n\r\nSickened with a numbing anguish of fear such as in all his life\r\nhe had never known, Stern stood there a moment, motionless and lost.\r\n\r\nThen he turned. Out into the hall he ran, and his voice, re-echoing\r\nwildly, rang through those long-deserted aisles.\r\n\r\nAll at once he heard a laugh behind him--a hail.\r\n\r\nHe wheeled about, trembling and spent. Out his arms went, in eager\r\ngreeting. For the girl, laughing and flushed, and very beautiful, was\r\ncoming down the stair at the end of the hall.\r\n\r\nNever had the engineer beheld a sight so wonderful to him as this\r\nwoman, clad in the Bengal robe; this girl who smiled and ran to meet\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"What? Were you frightened?\" she asked, growing suddenly serious, as\r\nhe stood there speechless and pale. \"Why--what could happen to me\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\nHis only answer was to take her in his arms and whisper her name. But\r\nshe struggled to be free.\r\n\r\n\"Don't! you mustn't!\" she exclaimed. \"I didn't mean to alarm you.\r\nDidn't even know you were here!\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard the shots--I called--you didn't answer. Then--\"\r\n\r\n\"You found me gone? I didn't hear you. It was nothing, after all.\r\nNothing--much!\"\r\n\r\nHe led her back into the room.\r\n\r\n\"What happened? Tell me!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was really too absurd!\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only this,\" and she laughed again. \"I was getting supper ready, as\r\nyou see,\" with a nod at their provision laid out upon the\r\nclean-brushed floor. \"When--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, a blundering great hawk swooped in through the window there,\r\ncircled around, pounced on the last of our beef and tried to fly away\r\nwith it.\"\r\n\r\nStern heaved a sigh of relief. \"So that was all?\" asked he. \"But the\r\nshots? And your absence?\"\r\n\r\n\"I struck at him. He showed fight. I blocked the window. He was\r\ndetermined to get away with the food. I was determined he _shouldn't_.\r\nSo I snatched the revolver and opened fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"That confused him. He flapped out into the hall. I chased him. Away\r\nup the stairs he circled. I shot again. Then I pursued. Went up two\r\nstories. But he must have got away through some opening or other. Our\r\nbeef's all gone!\" And Beatrice looked very sober.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, I've got a lot more stuff down-stairs. But tell me, did\r\nyou wing him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid not,\" she admitted. \"There's a feather or two on the\r\nstairs, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good work!\" cried he laughing, his fear all swallowed in the joy of\r\nhaving found her again, safe and unhurt. \"But please don't give me\r\nanother such panic, will you? It's all right this time, however.\r\n\r\n\"And now if you'll just wait here and not get fighting with any more\r\nwild creatures, I'll go down and bring my latest finds. I like your\r\npluck,\" he added slowly, gazing earnestly at her.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't want you chasing things in this old shell of a building.\r\nNo telling what crevice you might fall into or what accident might\r\nhappen. Au revoir!\"\r\n\r\nHer smile as he left her was inscrutable, but her eyes, strangely\r\nbright, followed him till he had vanished once more down the stairs.\r\n\r\n   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nBroad strokes, a line here, one there, with much left to the\r\nimagining--such will serve best for the painting of a picture like\r\nthis--a picture wherein every ordinary bond of human life, the nexus\r\nof man's society, is shattered. Where everything must strive to\r\nreconstruct itself from the dust. Where the future, if any such there\r\nmay be, must rise from the ashes of a crumbling past.\r\n\r\nBroad strokes, for detailed ones would fill too vast a canvas.\r\nImpossible to describe a tenth of the activities of Beatrice and Stern\r\nthe next four days. Even to make a list of their hard-won possessions\r\nwould turn this chapter into a mere catalogue.\r\n\r\nSo let these pass for the most part. Day by day the man, issuing forth\r\nsometimes alone, sometimes with Beatrice, labored like a Titan among\r\nthe ruins of New York.\r\n\r\nThough more than ninety per cent. of the city's one-time wealth had\r\nlong since vanished, and though all standards of worth had wholly\r\nchanged, yet much remained to harvest.\r\n\r\nInfinitudes of things, more or less damaged, they bore up to their\r\nshelter, up the stairs which here and there Stern had repaired with\r\nrough-hewn logs.\r\n\r\nFor now he had an ax, found in that treasure-house of Currier &\r\nBrown's, brought to a sharp edge on a wet, flat stone by the spring,\r\nand hefted with a sapling.\r\n\r\nThis implement was of incredible use, and greatly enheartened the\r\nengineer. More valuable it was than a thousand tons of solid gold.\r\n\r\nThe same store yielded also a well-preserved enameled water-pail and\r\nsome smaller dishes of like ware, three more knives, quantities of\r\nnails, and some small tools; also the tremendous bonanza of a magazine\r\nrifle and a shotgun, both of which Stern judged would come into shape\r\nby the application of oil and by careful tinkering. Of ammunition,\r\nhere and elsewhere, the engineer had no doubt he could unearth\r\nunlimited quantities.\r\n\r\n\"With steel,\" he reflected, \"and with my flint spearhead, I can make\r\nfire at any time. Wood is plenty, and there's lots of 'punk.' So the\r\nfirst step in reestablishing civilization is secure. With fire,\r\neverything else becomes possible.\r\n\r\n\"After a while, perhaps, I can get around to manufacturing matches\r\nagain. But for the present my few ounces of phosphorus and the flint\r\nand steel will answer very well.\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice, like the true woman she was, addressed herself eagerly to\r\nthe fascinating task of making a real home out of the barren\r\ndesolation of the fifth floor offices. Her splendid energy was no less\r\nthan the engineer's. And very soon a comfortable air pervaded the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nStern manufactured a broom for her by cutting willow withes and\r\nlashing them with hide strips onto a trimmed branch. Spiders and dust\r\nall vanished. A true housekeeping appearance set in.\r\n\r\nTo supplement the supply of canned food that accumulated along one of\r\nthe walls, Stern shot what game he could--squirrels, partridges and\r\nrabbits.\r\n\r\nMetal dishes, especially of solid gold, ravished from Fifth Avenue\r\nshops, took their place on the crude table he had fashioned with his\r\nax. Not for esthetic effect did they now value gold, but merely\r\nbecause that metal had perfectly withstood the ravages of time.\r\n\r\nIn the ruins of a magnificent store near Thirty-First Street, Stern\r\nfound a vault burst open by frost and slow disintegration of the\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nHere something over a quart of loose diamonds, big and little, rough\r\nand cut, were lying in confusion all about. Stern took none of these.\r\nTheir value now was no greater than that of any pebble.\r\n\r\nBut he chose a massive clasp of gold for Beatrice, for that could\r\nserve to fasten her robe. And in addition he gathered up a few rings\r\nand onetime costly jewels which could be worn. For the girl, after\r\nall, was one of Eve's daughters.\r\n\r\nBit by bit he accumulated many necessary articles, including some\r\ntooth-brushes which he found sealed in glass bottles, and a variety of\r\ngold toilet articles. Use was his first consideration now. Beauty came\r\nfar behind.\r\n\r\nIn the corner of their rooms, after a time, stood a fair variety of\r\ntools, some already serviceable, others waiting to be polished, ground\r\nand hefted, and in some cases retempered. Two rough chairs made their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe north room, used only for cooking, became their forge and oven all\r\nin one. For here, close to a window where the smoke could drift out,\r\nStern built a circular stone fireplace.\r\n\r\nAnd here Beatrice presided over her copper casseroles and saucepans\r\nfrom the little shop on Broadway. Here, too, Stern planned to\r\nconstruct a pair of skin bellows, and presently to set up the altars\r\nof Vulcan and of Tubal Cain once more.\r\n\r\nBoth of them \"thanked whatever gods there be\" that the girl was a good\r\ncook. She amazed the engineer by the variety of dishes she managed to\r\nconcoct from the canned goods, the game that Stern shot, and fresh\r\ndandelion greens dug near the spring. These edibles, with the blackest\r\nof black coffee, soon had them in fine fettle.\r\n\r\n\"I certainly have begun to put on weight,\" laughed the man after\r\ndinner on the fourth day, as he lighted his fragrant pipe with a roll\r\nof blazing birch-bark.\r\n\r\n\"My bearskin is getting tight. You'll have to let it out for me, or\r\nelse stop such magic in the kitchen.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled back at him, sitting there at ease in the sunshine by the\r\nwindow, sipping her coffee out of a gold cup with a solid gold spoon.\r\n\r\nStern, feeling the May breeze upon his face, hearing the bird-songs in\r\nthe forest depths, felt a well-being, a glow of health and joy such as\r\nhe had never in his whole life known--the health of outdoor labor and\r\nsound sleep and perfect digestion, the joy of accomplishment and of\r\nthe girl's near presence.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we do live pretty well,\" she answered, surveying the\r\nremnants of the feast. \"Potted tongue and peas, fried squirrel,\r\npartridge and coffee ought to satisfy anybody. But still--\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I _would_ like some buttered toast and some cream for my coffee, and\r\nsome sugar.\"\r\n\r\nStern laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\"You don't want much!\" he exclaimed, vastly amused, the while he blew\r\na cloud of Latakia smoke. \"Well, you be patient, and everything will\r\ncome, in time.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't expect me to do magic. On the fourth day you don't\r\nimagine I've had time enough to round up the ten thousandth descendant\r\nof the erstwhile cow, do you?\r\n\r\n\"Or grow cane and make sugar? Or find grain for seed, clear some land,\r\nplow, harrow, plant, hoe, reap, winnow, grind and bolt and present you\r\nwith a bag of prime flour? Now really?\"\r\n\r\nShe pouted at his raillery. For a moment there was silence, while he\r\ndrew at his pipe. At the girl he looked a little while. Then, his eyes\r\na bit far-away, he remarked in a tone he tried to render casual:\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Beatrice, it occurs to me that we're doing rather well\r\nfor old people--very old.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up with a startled glance.\r\n\r\n\"_Very?_\" she exclaimed. \"You know how old then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very, indeed!\" he answered. \"Yes, I've got some sort of an idea about\r\nit. I hope it won't alarm you when you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--how so? Alarm me?\" she queried with a strange expression.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, because, you see, it's rather a long time since we went to\r\nsleep. Quite so. You see, I've been doing a little calculating, off\r\nand on, at odd times. Been putting two and two together, as it were.\r\n\r\n\"First, there was the matter of the dust in sheltered places, to guide\r\nme. The rate of deposition of what, in one or two spots, can't have\r\nbeen anything less than cosmic or star-dust, is fairly certain.\r\n\r\n\"Then again, the rate of this present deterioration of stone and steel\r\nhas furnished another index. And last night I had a little peek at the\r\npole-star, through my telescope, while you were asleep.\r\n\r\n\"The good old star has certainly shifted out of place a bit.\r\nFurthermore, I've been observing certain evolutionary changes in the\r\nanimals and plants about us. Those have helped, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"And--and what have you found out?\" asked she with tremulous interest.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think I've got the answer, more or less correctly. Of course\r\nit's only an approximate result, as we say in engineering. But the\r\ndifferent items check up with some degree of consistency.\r\n\r\n\"And I'm safe in believing I'm within at least a hundred years of the\r\ndate one way or the other. Not a bad factor of safety, that, with my\r\nlimited means of working.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's eyes widened. From her hand fell the empty gold cup; it\r\nrolled away across the clean-swept floor.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" cried she. \"You've got it, within a hundred years! Why,\r\nthen--you mean it's _more_ than a hundred?\"\r\n\r\nIndulgently the engineer smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Come, now,\" he coaxed. \"Just guess, for instance, how old you really\r\nare--and growing younger every day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred maybe? Oh surely not as old as that! It's horrible to\r\nthink of!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" bade he. \"If I count your twenty-four years, when you went\r\nto sleep, you're now--\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're now at the very minimum calculation, just about one thousand\r\nand twenty-four! Some age, that, eh?\"\r\n\r\nThen, as she stared at him wide-eyed he added with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"No disputing that fact, no dodging it. The thing's as certain as that\r\nyou're now the most beautiful woman in the whole wide world!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nDRAWING TOGETHER\r\n\r\n\r\nDays passed, busy days, full of hard labor and achievement,\r\nrich in experience and learning, in happiness, in dreams of what the\r\nfuture might yet bring.\r\n\r\nBeatrice made and finished a considerable wardrobe of garments for\r\nthem both. These, when the fur had been clipped close with the\r\nscissors, were not oppressively warm, and, even though on some days a\r\nbit uncomfortable, the man and woman tolerated them because they had\r\nno others.\r\n\r\nPlenty of bathing and good food put them in splendid physical\r\ncondition, to which their active exercise contributed much. And thus,\r\njudging partly by the state of the foliage, partly by the height of\r\nthe sun, which Stern determined with considerable accuracy by means of\r\na simple, home-made quadrant--they knew mid-May was past and June was\r\ndrawing near.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeping by no means took up all the girl's time. Often she\r\nwent out with him on what he called his \"pirating expeditions,\" that\r\nnow sometimes led them as far afield as the sad ruins of the wharves\r\nand piers, or to the stark desolation and wreckage of lower Broadway\r\nand the onetime busy hives of newspaperdom, or up to Central Park or\r\nto the great remains of the two railroad terminals.\r\n\r\nThese two places, the former tide-gates of the city's life, impressed\r\nStern most painfully of anything. The disintegrated tracks, the\r\njumbled remains of locomotives and luxurious Pullmans with weeds\r\ngrowing rank upon them, the sunlight beating down through the caved-in\r\nroof of the Pennsylvania station \"concourse,\" where millions of human\r\nbeings once had trod in all the haste of men's paltry, futile affairs,\r\nfilled him with melancholy, and he was glad to get away again leaving\r\nthe place to the jungle, the birds and beasts that now laid claim to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Sic transit gloria mundi!\" he murmured, as with sad eyes he mused\r\nupon the down-tumbled columns along the facade, the overgrown\r\nentrance-way, the cracked and falling arches and architraves. \"And\r\n_this_, they said, was builded for all time!\"\r\n\r\nIt was on one of these expeditions that the engineer found and\r\npocketed--unknown to Beatrice--another disconcerting relic.\r\n\r\nThis was a bone, broken and splintered, and of no very great age,\r\ngnawed with perfectly visible tooth-marks. He picked it up, by chance,\r\nnear the west side of the ruins of the old City Hall.\r\n\r\nStern recognized the manner in which the bone had been cracked open\r\nwith a stone to let the marrow be sucked out. The sight of this\r\ngruesome relic revived all his fears, tenfold more acutely than ever,\r\nand filled him with a sense of vague, impending evil, of peril deadly\r\nto them both.\r\n\r\nThis was the more keen, because the engineer knew at a glance that the\r\nbone was the upper end of a human femur--human, or, at the very least,\r\nbelonging to some highly anthropoid animal. And of apes or gorillas he\r\nhad, as yet, found no trace in the forests of Manhattan.\r\n\r\nLong he mused over his find. But not a single word did he ever say to\r\nBeatrice concerning it or the flint spear-point. Only he kept his eyes\r\nand ears well open for other bits of corroborative evidence.\r\n\r\nAnd he never ventured a foot from the building unless his rifle and\r\nrevolver were with him, their magazines full of high-power shells.\r\n\r\nThe girl always went armed, too, and soon grew to be such an expert\r\nshot that she could drop a squirrel from the tip of a fir, or wing a\r\nheron in full flight.\r\n\r\nOnce her quick eyes spied a deer in the tangles of the one-time\r\nGramercy Park, now no longer neatly hedged with iron palings, but\r\nspread in wild confusion that joined the riot of growth beyond.\r\n\r\nOn the instant she fired, wounding the creature.\r\n\r\nStern's shot, echoing hers, missed. Already the deer was away, out of\r\nrange through the forest. With some difficulty they pursued down a\r\nglen-like strip of woods that must have once been Irving Place.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred yards south of the park they sighted the animal again. And\r\nthe girl with a single shot sent it crashing to earth.\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, Diana!\" hurrahed Stern, running forward with enthusiasm. The\r\n\"deer fever\" was on him, as strong as in his old days in the Hudson\r\nBay country. Hot was the pleasure of the kill when that meant food. As\r\nhe ran he jerked his knife from the skin sheath the girl had made for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThus they had fresh venison to their heart's content--venison broiled\r\nover white-hot coals in the fireplace, juicy and savory--sweet beyond\r\nall telling.\r\n\r\nA good deal of the meat they smoked and salted down for future use.\r\nStern undertook to tan the hide with strips of hemlock bark laid in a\r\nwater pit dug near the spring. He added also some oak-bark, nut-galls\r\nand a good quantity of young sumac shoots.\r\n\r\n\"I guess _that_ ought to hit the mark if anything will,\" remarked he,\r\nas he immersed the skin and weighed it down with rocks.\r\n\r\n\"It's like the old 'shotgun' prescriptions of our extinct doctors--a\r\nlittle of everything, bound to do the trick, one way or another.\"\r\n\r\nThe great variety of labors now imposed upon him began to try his\r\ningenuity to the full. In spite of all his wealth of practical\r\nknowledge and his scientific skill, he was astounded at the huge\r\ndemands of even the simplest human life.\r\n\r\nThe girl and he now faced these, without the social cooperation which\r\nthey had formerly taken entirely for granted, and the change of\r\nconditions had begun to alter Stern's concepts of almost everything.\r\n\r\nHe was already beginning to realize how true the old saying was: \"One\r\nman is no man!\" and how the world had _been_ the world merely because\r\nof the interrelations, the interdependencies of human beings in vast\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nHe was commencing to get a glimpse of the vanished social problems\r\nthat had enmeshed civilization, in their true light, now that all he\r\nconfronted and had to struggle with was the unintelligent and\r\noverbearing dominance of nature.\r\n\r\nAll this was of huge value to the engineer. And the strong\r\nindividualism (essentially anarchistic) on which he had prided himself\r\na thousand years ago, was now beginning to receive some mortal blows,\r\neven during these first days of the new, solitary, unsocialized life.\r\n\r\nBut neither he nor the girl had very much time for introspective\r\nthought. Each moment brought its immediate task, and every day seemed\r\nbusier than the last had been.\r\n\r\nAt meals, however, or at evening, as they sat together by the light of\r\ntheir lamp in the now homelike offices, Stern and Beatrice found\r\npleasure in a little random speculation. Often they discussed the\r\ncatastrophe and their own escape.\r\n\r\nStern brought to mind some of Professor Raoul Pictet's experiments\r\nwith animals, in which the Frenchman had suspended animation for long\r\nperiods by sudden freezing. This method seemed to answer, in a way,\r\nthe girl's earlier questions as to how they had escaped death in the\r\nmany long winters since they had gone to sleep.\r\n\r\nAgain, they tried to imagine the scenes just following the\r\ncatastrophe, the horror of that long-past day, and the slow,\r\nirrevocable decay of all the monuments of the human race.\r\n\r\nOften they talked till past midnight, by the glow of their stone\r\nfireplace, and many were the aspects of the case that they developed.\r\nThese hours seemed to Stern the happiest of his life.\r\n\r\nFor the rapprochement between this beautiful woman and himself at\r\nsuch times became very close and fascinatingly intimate, and Stern\r\nfelt, little by little, that the love which now was growing deep\r\nwithin his heart for her was not without its answer in her own.\r\n\r\nBut for the present the man restrained himself and spoke no overt\r\nword. For that, he understood, would immediately have put all things\r\non a different basis--and there was urgent work still waiting to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\"There's no doubt in my mind,\" said he one day as they sat talking,\r\n\"that you and I are absolutely the last human beings--civilized I\r\nmean--left alive anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n\"If anybody else had been spared, whether in Chicago or San Francisco,\r\nin London, Paris or Hong-Kong, they'd have made some determined effort\r\nbefore now to get in touch with New York. This, the prime center of\r\nthe financial and industrial world, would have been their first\r\nobjective point.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose,\" asked she, \"there _were_ others, just a few here or\r\nthere, and they'd only recently waked up, like ourselves. Could they\r\nhave succeeded in making themselves known to us so soon?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook a dubious head.\r\n\r\n\"There may be some one else, somewhere,\" he answered slowly, \"but\r\nthere's nobody else in this part of the world, anyhow. Nobody in this\r\nparticular Eden but just you and me. To all intents and purposes I'm\r\nAdam. And you--well, you're Eve! But the tree? We haven't found\r\nthat--yet.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave him a quick, startled glance, then let her head fall, so that\r\nhe could not see her eyes. But up over her neck, her cheek and even to\r\nher temples, where the lustrous masses of hair fell away, he saw a\r\ntide of color mount.\r\n\r\nAnd for a little space the man forgot to smoke. At her he gazed, a\r\nstrange gleam in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd no word passed between them for a while. But their thoughts--?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT EXPERIMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea that there might possibly be others of their kind in\r\nfar-distant parts of the earth worked strongly on the mind of the\r\ngirl. Next day she broached the subject again to her companion.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" theorized she, \"there might be a few score of others, maybe\r\na few hundred, scattered here and there? They might awaken one by one,\r\nonly to die, if less favorably situated than we happen to be. Perhaps\r\nthousands may have slept, like us, only to wake up to starvation!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no telling, of course,\" he answered seriously. \"Undoubtedly\r\nthat may be very possible. Some may have escaped the great death, on\r\nhigh altitudes--on the Eiffel Tower, for instance, or on certain\r\nmountains or lofty plateaus. The most we can do for the moment is just\r\nto guess at the probabilities. And--\"\r\n\r\n\"But if there _are_ people elsewhere?\" she interrupted eagerly, her\r\neyes glowing with hope, \"isn't there any way to get in touch with\r\nthem? Why don't _we_ hunt? Suppose only one or two in each country\r\nshould have survived; if we could get them all together again in a\r\nsingle colony--don't you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the different languages and arts and all the rest might\r\nstill be preserved? The colony might grow and flourish, and mankind\r\nagain take possession of the earth and conquer it, in a few decades?\r\nYes, of course. But even though there shouldn't be anybody else,\r\nthere's no cause for despair. Of that, however, we won't speak now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why don't we try to find out about it?\" she persisted. \"If there\r\nwere only the remotest chance--\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, I _will_ try it!\" exclaimed the engineer, fired with a new\r\nthought, a fresh ambition. \"How? I don't know just yet, but I'll see.\r\nThere'll be a way, right enough, if I can only think it out!\"\r\n\r\nThat afternoon he made his way down Broadway, past the copper-shop, to\r\nthe remains of the telegraph office opposite the Flatiron.\r\n\r\nInto it he penetrated with some difficulty. A mournful sight it was,\r\nthis one-time busy ganglion of the nation's nerve-system. Benches and\r\ncounters were quite gone, instruments corroded past recognition,\r\neverything in hideous disorder.\r\n\r\nBut in a rear room Stern found a large quantity of copper wire. The\r\nwooden drums on which it had been wound were gone; the insulation had\r\nvanished, but the coils of wire still remained.\r\n\r\n\"Fine!\" said the explorer, gathering together several coils. \"Now when\r\nI get this over to the Metropolitan, I think the first step toward\r\nsuccess will have been taken.\"\r\n\r\nBy nightfall he had accumulated enough wire for his tentative\r\nexperiments. Next day he and the girl explored the remains of the old\r\nwireless station on the roof of the building, overlooking Madison\r\nAvenue.\r\n\r\nThey reached the roof by climbing out of a window on the east side of\r\nthe tower and descending a fifteen-foot ladder that Stern had built\r\nfor the purpose out of rough branches.\r\n\r\n\"You see it's fairly intact as yet,\" remarked the engineer, gesturing\r\nat the bread expanse. \"Only, falling stones have made holes here and\r\nthere. See how they yawn down into the rooms below! Well, come on,\r\nfollow me. I'll tap with the ax, and if the roof holds me you'll be\r\nsafe.\"\r\n\r\nThus, after a little while, they found a secure path to the little\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nThis diminutive building, fortunately constructed of concrete, still\r\nstood almost unharmed. Into it they penetrated through the crumbling\r\ndoor. The winds of heaven had centuries ago swept away all trace of\r\nthe ashes of the operator.\r\n\r\nBut there still stood the apparatus, rusted and sagging and\r\ndisordered, yet to Stern's practiced eye showing signs of promise. An\r\nhour's careful overhauling convinced the engineer that something might\r\nyet be accomplished.\r\n\r\nAnd thus they set to work in earnest.\r\n\r\nFirst, with the girl's help, he strung his copper-wire antennae from\r\nthe tiled platform of the tower to the roof of the wireless station.\r\nRough work this was, but answering the purpose as well as though of\r\nthe utmost finish.\r\n\r\nHe connected up the repaired apparatus with these antennae, and made\r\nsure all was well. Then he dropped the wires over the side of the\r\nbuilding to connect with one of the dynamos in the sub-basement.\r\n\r\nAll this took two and a half days of severe labor, in intervals of\r\nfood-getting, cooking and household tasks. At last, when it was done--\r\n\r\n\"Now for some power!\" exclaimed the engineer. And with his lamp he\r\nwent down to inspect the dynamos again and to assure himself that his\r\nbelief was correct, his faith that one or two of them could be put\r\ninto running order.\r\n\r\nThree of the machines gave little promise, for water had dripped in on\r\nthem and they were rusted beyond any apparent rehabilitation. The\r\nfourth, standing nearest Twenty-Third Street, had by some freak of\r\nchance been protected by a canvas cover.\r\n\r\nThis cover was now only a mass of rotten rags, but it had at least\r\nsafeguarded the machine for so long that no very serious deterioration\r\nhad set in.\r\n\r\nStern worked the better part of a week with such tools as he could\r\nfind or make--he had to forge a wrench for the largest nuts--\"taking\r\ndown\" the dynamo, oiling, filing, polishing and repairing it, part by\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThe commutator was in bad shape and the brushes terribly corroded. But\r\nhe tinkered and patched, hammered and heated and filed away, and at\r\nlast putting the machine together again with terrible exertion,\r\ndecided that it would run.\r\n\r\n\"Steam now!\" was his next watchword, when he had wired the dynamo to\r\nconnect with the station on the roof. And this was on the eighth day\r\nsince he had begun his labor.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the boiler-room, which he reached by moving a ton of\r\nfallen stone-work from the doorway into the dynamo-room, encouraged\r\nhim still further. As he penetrated into this place, feeble-shining\r\nlamp held on high, eyes eager to behold the prospect, he knew that\r\nsuccess was not far away.\r\n\r\nDown in these depths, almost as in the interior of the great Pyramid\r\nof Gizeh--though the place smelled dank and close and stifling--time\r\nseemed to have lost much of its destructive power. He chose one boiler\r\nthat looked sound, and began looking for coal.\r\n\r\nOf this he found a plentiful supply, well-preserved, in the bunkers.\r\nAll one afternoon he labored, wheeling it in a steel barrow and\r\ndumping it in front of the furnace.\r\n\r\nWhere the smoke-stack led to and what condition it was in he knew not.\r\nHe could not tell where the gases of combustion would escape to; but\r\nthis he decided to leave to chance.\r\n\r\nHe grimaced at sight of the rusted flues and the steam-pipes\r\nconnecting with the dynamo-room-pipes now denuded of their asbestos\r\npacking and leaky at several joints.\r\n\r\nA strange, gnome-like picture he presented as he poked and pried in\r\nthose dim regions, by the dim rays of the lamp. Spiders, roaches and a\r\ngreat gray rat or two were his only companions--those, and hope.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know but I'm a fool to try and carry this thing out,\" said\r\nhe, dubiously surveying the pipe. \"I'm liable to start something here\r\nthat I can't stop. Water-glasses leaky, gauges plugged up,\r\nsafety-valve rusted into its seat--the devil!\"\r\n\r\nBut still he kept on. Something drove him inexorably forward. For he\r\nwas an engineer--and an American.\r\n\r\nHis next task was to fill the boiler. This he had to do by bringing\r\nwater, two pails at a time from the spring. It took him three days.\r\n\r\nThus, after eleven days of heart-breaking lonely toil in that grimy\r\ndungeon, hampered for lack of tools, working with rotten materials,\r\nnaked and sweaty, grimed, spent, profane, exhausted, everything was\r\nready for the experiment--the strangest, surely, in the annals of the\r\nhuman race.\r\n\r\nHe lighted up the furnace with dry wood, then stoked it full of coal.\r\nAfter an hour and a half his heart thrilled with mingled fear and\r\nexultation at sight of the steam, first white, then blue and thin,\r\nthat began to hiss from the leaks in the long pipe.\r\n\r\n\"No way to estimate pressure, or anything,\" remarked he. \"It's bull\r\nluck whether I go to hell or not!\" And he stood back from the blinding\r\nglare of the furnace. With his naked arm he wiped the sweat from his\r\nstreaming forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Bull luck!\" repeated he. \"But by the Almighty, I'll send that Morse,\r\nor bust!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE MOVING LIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\nPanting with exhaustion and excitement, Stern made his way back\r\nto the engine-room. It was a strangely critical moment when he seized\r\nthe corroded throttle-wheel to start the dynamo. The wheel stuck, and\r\nwould not budge.\r\n\r\nStern, with a curse of sheer exasperation, snatched up his long\r\nspanner, shoved it through the spokes, and wrenched.\r\n\r\nGroaning, the wheel gave way. It turned. The engineer hauled again.\r\n\r\n\"Go on!\" shouted the man. \"Start! Move!\"\r\n\r\nWith a hissing plaint, as though rebellious against this awakening\r\nafter its age-long sleep, the engine creaked into motion.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all Stern's oiling, every journal and bearing squealed in\r\nanguish. A rickety tremble possessed the engine as it gained speed.\r\nThe dynamo began to hum with wild, strange protests of racked metal.\r\nThe ancient \"drive\" of tarred hemp strained and quivered, but held.\r\n\r\nAnd like the one-hoss shay about to collapse, the whole fabric of the\r\nresuscitated plant, leaking at a score of joints, creaking, whistling,\r\nshaking, voicing a hundred agonized mechanic woes, revived in a\r\ngrotesque, absurd and shocking imitation of its one-time beauty and\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAt sight of this ghastly resurrection, the engineer (whose whole life\r\nhad been passed in the love and service of machinery) felt a strange\r\nand sad emotion.\r\n\r\nHe sat down, exhausted, on the floor. In his hand the lamp trembled.\r\nYet, all covered with sweat and dirt and rust as he was, this moment\r\nof triumph was one of the sweetest he had ever known.\r\n\r\nHe realized that this was now no time for inaction. Much yet remained\r\nto be done. So up he got again, and set to work.\r\n\r\nFirst he made sure the dynamo was running with no serious defect and\r\nthat his wiring had been made properly. Then he heaped the furnace\r\nfull of coal, and closed the door, leaving only enough draft to insure\r\na fairly steady heat for an hour or so.\r\n\r\nThis done, he toiled back up to where Beatrice was eagerly awaiting\r\nhim in the little wireless station on the roof.\r\n\r\nIn he staggered, all but spent. Panting for breath, wild-eyed, his\r\ncoal-blackened arms stretching out from the whiteness of the\r\nbear-skin, he made a singular picture.\r\n\r\n\"It's going!\" he exclaimed. \"I've got current--it's good for a while,\r\nanyhow. Now--now for the test!\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment he leaned heavily against the concrete bench to which the\r\napparatus was clamped. Already the day had drawn close to its end. The\r\nglow of evening had begun to fade a trifle, along the distant skyline;\r\nand beyond the Palisades a dull purple pall was settling down.\r\n\r\nBy the dim light that filtered through the doorway, Beatrice looked at\r\nhis deep-lined, bearded face, now reeking with sweat and grimed with\r\ndust and coal. An ugly face--but not to her. For through that mask she\r\nread the dominance, the driving force, the courage of this versatile,\r\nunconquerable man.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" suddenly laughed Stern, with a strange accent in his voice,\r\n\"well then, here goes for the operator in the Eiffel Tower, eh?\"\r\n\r\nAgain he glanced keenly, in the failing light, at the apparatus there\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n\"She'll do, I guess,\" judged he, slipping on the rusted head-receiver.\r\nHe laid his hand upon the key and tried a few tentative dots and\r\ndashes.\r\n\r\nBreathless, the girl watched, daring no longer to question him. In the\r\ndielectric, the green sparks and spurts of living flame began to\r\ncrackle and to hiss like living spirits of an unknown power.\r\n\r\nStern, feeling again harnessed to his touch the life-force of the\r\nworld that once had been, exulted with a wild emotion. Yet,\r\nscience-worshiper that he was, something of reverent awe tinged the\r\nkeen triumph. A strange gleam dwelt within his eyes; and through his\r\nlips the breath came quick as he flung his very being into this\r\nsupreme experiment.\r\n\r\nHe reached for the ondometer. Carefully, slowly, he \"tuned up\" the\r\nwave-lengths; up, up to five thousand metres, then back again; he ran\r\nthe whole gamut of the wireless scale.\r\n\r\nOut, ever out into the thickening gloom, across the void and vacancy\r\nof the dead world, he flung his lightnings in a wild appeal. His face\r\ngrew hard and eager.\r\n\r\n\"Anything? Any answer?\" asked Beatrice, laying a hand upon his\r\nshoulder--a hand that trembled.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head in negation. Again he switched the roaring current\r\non; again he hurled out into ether his cry of warning and distress,\r\nof hope, of invitation--the last lone call of man to man--of the\r\nlast New Yorker to any other human being who, by the merest chance,\r\nmight possibly hear him in the wreck of other cities, other lands.\r\n\"S. O. S.!\" crackled the green flame. \"S. O. S.! _S. O. S.!_--\"\r\n\r\nThus came night, fully, as they waited, as they called and listened;\r\nas, together there in that tiny structure on the roof of the\r\ntremendous ruin, they swept the heavens and the earth with their wild\r\ncall--in vain.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour passed and still the engineer, grim as death, whirled the\r\nchained lightnings out and away.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing yet?\" cried Beatrice at last, unable to keep silence any\r\nlonger. \"Are you quite sure you can't--\"\r\n\r\nThe question was not finished.\r\n\r\nFor suddenly, far down below them, as though buried in the entrails of\r\nthe earth, shuddered a stifled, booming roar.\r\n\r\nThrough every rotten beam and fiber the vast wreck of the building\r\nvibrated. Some wall or other, somewhere, crumbled and went crashing\r\ndown with a long, deep droning thunder that ended in a sliding\r\ndiminuendo of noise.\r\n\r\n\"The boiler!\" shouted Stern.\r\n\r\nOff he flung the head-piece. He leaped up; he seized the girl.\r\n\r\nOut of the place he dragged her. She screamed as a huge weight from\r\nhigh aloft on the tower smashed bellowing through the roof, and with a\r\nshower of stones ripped its way down through the rubbish of the floors\r\nbelow, as easily as a bullet would pierce a newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe crash sent them recoiling. The whole roof shook and trembled like\r\nhoney-combed ice in a spring thaw.\r\n\r\nDown below, something rumbled, jarred, and came to rest.\r\n\r\nBoth of them expected nothing but that the entire structure would\r\ncollapse like a card-house and shatter down in ruins that would be\r\ntheir death.\r\n\r\nBut though it swayed and quivered, as in the grasp of an earthquake,\r\nit held.\r\n\r\nStern circled Beatrice with his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Courage, now! Steady now, _steady!_\" cried he.\r\n\r\nThe grinding, the booming of down-hurled stones and walls died away;\r\nthe echoes ceased. A wind-whipped cloud of steam and smoke burst up,\r\nfanlike, beyond the edge of the roof. It bellied away, dim in the\r\nnight, upon the stiff northerly breeze.\r\n\r\n\"Fire?\" ventured the girl.\r\n\r\n\"No! Nothing to burn. But come, come; let's get out o' this anyhow.\r\nThere's nothing doing, any more. All through! Too much risk staying up\r\nhere, now.\"\r\n\r\nSilent and dejected, they made their cautious way over the shaken\r\nroof. They walked with the greatest circumspection, to avoid falling\r\nthrough some new hole or freshly opened crevasse.\r\n\r\nTo Stern, especially, this accident was bitter. After nearly a\r\nfortnight's exhausting toil, the miserable fiasco was maddening.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" suddenly exclaimed the engineer, pointing. A vast, gaping\r\ncanyon of blackness opened at their very feet--a yawning gash forty\r\nfeet long and ten or twelve broad, with roughly jagged edges, leading\r\ndown into unfathomed depths below.\r\n\r\nStern gazed at it, puzzled, a moment, then peered up into the darkness\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\"H-m!\" said he. \"One of the half-ton hands of the big clock up there\r\nhas just taken a drop, that's all. One drop too much, I call it. Now\r\nif we--or our rooms--had just happened to be underneath? Some\r\nexcitement, eh?\"\r\n\r\nThey circled the opening and approached the tower wall. Stern picked\r\nup the rough ladder, which had been shaken down from its place, and\r\nonce more set it to the window through which they were to enter.\r\n\r\nBut even as Beatrice put her foot on the first rung, she started with\r\na cry. Stern felt the grip of her trembling hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" exclaimed he.\r\n\r\n\"Look! _Look!_\"\r\n\r\nImmobile with astonishment and fear, she stood pointing out and away,\r\nto westward, toward the Hudson.\r\n\r\nStern's eyes followed her hand.\r\n\r\nHe tried to cry out, but only stammered some broken, unintelligible\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nThere, very far away and very small, yet clearly visible in swarms\r\nupon the inky-black expanse of waters, a hundred, a thousand little\r\npoints of light were moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPORTENTS OF WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nStern and Beatrice stood there a few seconds at the foot of the\r\nladder, speechless, utterly at a loss for any words to voice the\r\nturmoil of confused thoughts awakened by this inexplicable apparition.\r\n\r\nBut all at once the girl, with a wordless cry, sank on her knees\r\nbeside the vast looming bulk of the tower. She covered her face with\r\nboth hands, and through her fingers the tears of joy began to flow.\r\n\r\n\"Saved--oh, we're saved!\" cried she. \"There _are_ people--and they're\r\ncoming for us!\"\r\n\r\nStern glanced down at her, an inscrutable expression on his face,\r\nwhich had grown hard and set and ugly. His lips moved, as though he\r\nwere saying something to himself; but no sound escaped them.\r\n\r\nThen, quite suddenly, he laughed a mirthless laugh. To him vividly\r\nflashed back the memory of the flint spear-head and the gnawed\r\nleg-bone, cracked open so the marrow could be sucked out, all gashed\r\nwith savage tooth-marks.\r\n\r\nA certain creepy sensation began to develop along his spine. He felt a\r\nprickling on the nape of his neck, as the hair stirred there.\r\nInstinctively he reached for his revolver.\r\n\r\n\"So, then,\" he sneered at himself, \"we're up against it, after all?\r\nAnd all my calculations about the world being swept clear, were so\r\nmuch punk? Well, well, this _is_ interesting! Oh, I see it coming, all\r\nright--good and plenty--and soon!\"\r\n\r\nBut the girl interrupted his ugly thoughts as he stood there straining\r\nhis eyes out into the dark.\r\n\r\n\"How splendid! How glorious!\" cried she. \"Only to think that we're\r\ngoing to see people again! Can you imagine it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's the matter? You--speak as though you weren't--_saved!_\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean to. It's--just surprise, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come! Let's signal them with a fire from the tower top. _I'll_ help\r\ncarry wood. Let's hurry down and run and meet them!\"\r\n\r\nHighly excited, the girl had got to her feet again, and now, clutched\r\nthe engineer's arm in burning eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go! Go--at once! This minute!\"\r\n\r\nBut he restrained her.\r\n\r\n\"You don't really think that would be quite prudent, do you?\" asked\r\nhe. \"Not just yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, can't you see? We--that is, there is no way to tell--\"\r\n\r\n\"But they're coming to save us, can't you see? Somehow, somewhere,\r\nthey must have caught that signal! And shall we wait, and perhaps let\r\nthem lose us, after all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not. But first we--why, we ought to make quite sure, you\r\nunderstand. Sure that they--they're really civilized, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they _must_ be, to have read the wireless!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you're counting on that, are you? Well, that's a big assumption.\r\nIt won't do. No, we've got to go slow in this game. Got to wait. Wait,\r\nand see. Easy does it!\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to speak boldly and with nonchalance, but the girl's keen ear\r\ndetected at least a little of the emotion that was troubling him. She\r\nkept a moment's silence, while the quivering lights drew on and on,\r\nsteadily, slowly, like a host of fireflies on the bosom of the night.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you get the telescope, and see?\" she asked, at length.\r\n\r\n\"No use. It isn't a night-glass. Couldn't see a thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But anyhow, those lights mean _men_, don't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally. But until we know what kind, we're better off right where\r\nwe are. I'm willing to welcome the coming guest, all right, if he's\r\npeaceful. Otherwise, it's powder and ball, hot water, stones and\r\nthings for him!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl stared a moment at the engineer, while this new idea took\r\nroot within her brain.\r\n\r\n\"You--you don't mean,\" she faltered at last, \"that these may\r\nbe--_savages!_\"\r\n\r\nHe started at the word. \"What makes you think that?\" he parried,\r\nstriving to spare her all needless alarm.\r\n\r\nShe pondered a moment, while the fire-dots, like a shoal of swimming\r\nstars, drew slowly nearer, nearer the Manhattan shore.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, _are_ they savages?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I know?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's easy enough to see you've got an opinion about it. You _think_\r\nthey're savages, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it's very possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if so--what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"What then? Why, in case they aren't mighty nice and kind, there'll be\r\na hot time in the old town, that's all. And somebody'll get hurt. It\r\nwon't be _us!_\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice asked no more, for a minute or two, but the engineer felt her\r\nfingers tighten on his arm.\r\n\r\n\"I'm with you, till the end!\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nAnother pregnant silence, while the nightwind stirred her hair and\r\nwafted the warm feminine perfume of her to his nostrils. Stern took a\r\nlong, deep breath. A sort of dizziness crept over him, as from a glass\r\nof wine on an empty stomach. The Call of Woman strove to master him,\r\nbut he repelled it. And, watching the creeping lights, he spoke; spoke\r\nto himself as much as to the girl; spoke, lest he think too much.\r\n\r\n\"There's a chance, a mere possibility,\" said he, \"that those boats,\r\ncanoes, coracles or whatever they may be, belong to white people, far\r\ndescendants of the few suppositions survivors of the cataclysm.\r\nThere's some slight chance that these people may be civilized, or\r\npartly so.\r\n\r\n\"Why they're coming across the Hudson, at this time o' night, with\r\nwhat object and to what place, we can't even guess. All we can do is\r\nwait, and watch and--be ready for anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"For anything!\" she echoed. \"You've seen me shoot! You know!\"\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, and pressed it. And silence fell again, as the long\r\nvigil started, there in the shadow of the tower, on the roof.\r\n\r\nFor some quarter of an hour, neither spoke. Then at last, said Stern:\r\n\r\n\"See, now! The lights seem to be winking out. The canoes must have\r\ncome close in toward the shore of the island. They're being masked\r\nbehind the trees. The people--whoever they are--will be landing\r\ndirectly now!\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait and see!\"\r\n\r\nThey resigned themselves to patience. The girl's breath came quickly,\r\nas she watched. Even the engineer felt his heart throb with\r\naccelerated haste.\r\n\r\nNow, far in the east, dim over the flat and dreary ruins of Long\r\nIsland, the sky began to silver, through a thin veil of cirrus cloud.\r\nA pallid moon was rising. Far below, a breeze stirred the tree-fronds\r\nin Madison Forest. A bat staggered drunkenly about the tower, then\r\nreeled away into the gloom; and, high aloft, an owl uttered its\r\nmelancholy plaint.\r\n\r\nBeatrice shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"They'll be here pretty soon!\" whispered she. \"Hadn't we better go\r\ndown, and get our guns? In case--\"\r\n\r\n\"Time enough,\" he answered. \"Wait a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hark! What's that?\" she exclaimed suddenly, holding her breath.\r\n\r\nOff to northward, dull, muffled, all but inaudible, they both heard a\r\nrhythmic pulsing, strangely barbaric.\r\n\r\n\"Heavens!\" ejaculated Stern. \"War-drums! Tom-toms, as I live!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE GATHERING OF THE HORDES\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Tom-toms? So they _are_ savages?\" exclaimed the girl, taking a quick\r\nbreath. \"But--what _then?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't just know, yet. It's a fact, though; they're certainly savages.\r\nTwo tribes, one with torches, one with drums. Two different kinds, I\r\nguess. And they're coming in here to parley or fight or something.\r\nRegular powwow on hand. Trouble ahead, whichever side wins!\"\r\n\r\n\"For us?\"\r\n\r\n\"That depends. Maybe we'll be able to lie hidden, here, till this\r\nthing blows over, whatever it may be. If not, and if they cut off our\r\nwater-supply, well--\"\r\n\r\nHe ended with a kind of growl. The sound gave Beatrice a strange\r\nsensation. She kept a moment's silence, then remarked:\r\n\r\n\"They're up around Central Park now, the drums are, don't you think\r\nso? How far do you make that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Close on to two miles. Come, let's be moving.\"\r\n\r\nIn silence they climbed the shaky ladder, reached the tower stairs and\r\ndescended the many stories to their dwelling.\r\n\r\nHere, the first thing Stern did was to strike a light, which he masked\r\nin a corner, behind a skin stretched like a screen from one wall to\r\nthe other. By this illumination, very dim yet adequate, he minutely\r\nexamined all their firearms.\r\n\r\nHe loaded every one to capacity and made sure all were in working\r\norder. Then he satisfied himself that the supply of cartridges was\r\nample. These he laid carefully along by the windows overlooking\r\nMadison Forest, by the door leading into the suite of offices, and by\r\nthe stair-head that gave access to the fifth floor.\r\n\r\nThen he blew out the light again.\r\n\r\n\"Two revolvers, one shotgun, and one rifle, all told,\" said he. \"All\r\nmagazine arms. I guess that'll hold them for a while, if it comes down\r\nto brass tacks! How's your nerve, Beatrice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never better!\" she whispered, from the dark. He saw the dim white\r\nblur that indicated her face, and it was very dear to him, all of a\r\nsudden--dearer, far, than he had ever realized.\r\n\r\n\"Good little girl!\" he exclaimed, giving her the rifle. A moment his\r\nhand pressed hers. Then with a quick intake of the breath, he strode\r\nover to the window and once more listened. She followed.\r\n\r\n\"Much nearer, now!\" judged he. \"Hear _that_, will you?\"\r\n\r\nAgain they listened.\r\n\r\nLouder now the drums sounded, dull, ominous, pulsating like the\r\nhammering of a fever-pulse inside a sick man's skull. A dull, confused\r\nhum, a noise as of a swarming mass of bees, drifted down-wind.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe they'll pass by?\" whispered Beatrice.\r\n\r\n\"It's Madison Forest they're aiming at!\" returned the engineer. \"See\r\nthere!\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed to westward.\r\n\r\nThere, far off along the forest-lane of Fourteenth Street, a sudden\r\ngleam of light flashed out among the trees, vanished, reappeared, was\r\njoined by two, ten, a hundred others. And now the whole approach to\r\nMadison Forest, by several streets, began to sparkle with these\r\nfeux-follets, weaving and flickering unsteadily toward the square.\r\n\r\nHere, there, everywhere through the dense masses of foliage, the\r\nwatchers could already see a dim and moving mass, fitfully illuminated\r\nby torches that now burned steady, now flared into red and smoky\r\ntourbillons of flame in the night-wind.\r\n\r\n\"Like monster glow-worms, crawling among the trees!\" the girl\r\nexclaimed. \"We _could_ mow them down, from here, already! God grant we\r\nsha'n't have to fight!\"\r\n\r\n\"S-h-h-h! Wait and see what's up!\"\r\n\r\nNow, from the other horde, coming from the north, sounds of warlike\r\npreparation were growing ever louder.\r\n\r\nWith quicker beats the insistent tom-toms throbbed their rhythmic\r\nmelancholy rune, hollow and dissonant. Then all at once the drums\r\nceased; and through the night air drifted a minor chant; a wail, that\r\nrose, fell, died, and came again, lagging as many strange voices\r\njoined it.\r\n\r\nAnd from the square, below, a shrill, high-pitched, half-animal cry\r\nresponded. Creeping shudders chilled the flesh along the engineer's\r\nbackbone.\r\n\r\n\"What I need, now,\" thought he, \"is about a hundred pounds of\r\nhigh-grade dynamite, or a gallon of nitroglycerin. Better still, a\r\ndozen capsules of my own invention, my 'Pulverite!'\r\n\r\n\"I guess _that_ would settle things mighty quick. It would be the\r\njoker in this game, all right! Well, why not make some? With what\r\nchemicals I've got left, couldn't I work up a half-pint? Bottled in\r\nglass flasks, I guess it would turn the trick on 'em!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they look black!\" suddenly interrupted the girl. \"See there--and\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed toward the spring. Stern saw moving shadows in the dark.\r\nThen, through an opening, he got a blurred impression of a hand,\r\nholding a torch. He saw a body, half-human.\r\n\r\nThe glimpse vanished, but he had seen enough.\r\n\r\n\"Black--yes, blue-black! They seem so, anyhow. And--why, did you see\r\nthe _size_ of them? No bigger than apes! Good Heaven!\"\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily he shuddered. For now, like a dream-horde of hideous\r\ncreatures seen in a nightmare, the torch-bearers had spread all\r\nthrough the forest at the base of the Metropolitan.\r\n\r\nAway from the building out across by the spring and even to Fifth\r\nAvenue the mob extended, here thick, there thin, without order or\r\ncoherence--a shifting, murmuring, formless, seemingly planless\r\ncongeries of dull brutality.\r\n\r\nHere or there, where the swaying of the trees parted the branches a\r\nlittle, the wavering lights brought some fragment of the mass to view.\r\n\r\nNo white thing showed anywhere. All was dark and vague. Indistinctly,\r\nwaveringly as in a vision, dusky heads could be made out. There showed\r\na naked arm, greasily shining for a second in the ruddy glow which now\r\ndiffused itself through the whole wood. Here the watchers saw a\r\nglistening back; again, an out-thrust leg, small and crooked, apelike\r\nand repulsive.\r\n\r\nAnd once again the engineer got a glimpse of a misshapen hand, a long,\r\nlean, hideous hand that clutched a spear. But, hardly seen, it\r\nvanished into obscurity once more.\r\n\r\n\"Seems as though malformed human members, black and bestial, had been\r\nflung at random into a ghastly kaleidoscope, turned by a madman!\"\r\nwhispered Stern. The girl answering nothing, peered out in fascinated\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nUp, up to the watchers rose a steady droning hum; and from the\r\nnorthward, ever louder, ever clearer, came now the war-song of the\r\nattacking party. The drums began again, suddenly. A high-pitched,\r\nscreaming laugh echoed and died among the woods beyond the ruins of\r\nTwenty-eighth street.\r\n\r\nStill in through the western approaches of the square, more and more\r\nlights kept straggling. Thicker and still more thick grew the press\r\nbelow. Now the torch-glow was strong enough to cast its lurid\r\nreflections on the vacant-staring wrecks of windows and of walls,\r\ngaping like the shattered skulls of a civilization which was no more.\r\nTo the nostrils of the man and woman up floated an acrid, pitchy\r\nsmell. And birds, dislodged from sleep, began to zigzag about,\r\naimlessly, with frightened cries. One even dashed against the\r\nbuilding, close at hand; and fell, a fluttering, broken thing, to\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nStern, with a word of hot anger, fingered his revolver. But Beatrice\r\nlaid her hand upon his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet!\" begged she.\r\n\r\nHe glanced down at her, where she stood beside him at the empty\r\nembrasure of the window. The dim light from the vast and empty\r\noverarch of sky, powdered with a wonder of stars, showed him the vague\r\noutline of her face. Wistful and pale she was, yet very brave. Through\r\nStern welled a sudden tenderness.\r\n\r\nHe put his arm around her, and for a moment her head lay on his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nBut only a moment.\r\n\r\nFor, all at once, a snarling cry rang through the wood; and, with a\r\nnorthward surge of the torch-bearers, a confused tumult of shrieks,\r\nhowls, simian chatterings and dull blows, the battle joined between\r\nthose two vague, strange forces down below in the black forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSTERN'S RESOLVE\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long it lasted, what its meaning, its details, the watchers\r\ncould not tell. Impossible, from that height and in that gloom, broken\r\nonly by an occasional pale gleam of moonlight through the drifting\r\ncloud-rack, to judge the fortunes of this primitive war.\r\n\r\nThey knew not the point at issue nor yet the tide of victory or loss.\r\nOnly they knew that back and forth the torches flared, the war-drums\r\nboomed and rattled, the yelling, slaughtering, demoniac hordes surged\r\nin a swirl of bestial murder-lust.\r\n\r\nAnd so time passed, and fewer grew the drums, yet the torches flared\r\non; and, as the first gray dawn went fingering up the sky there came a\r\nbreak, a flight, a merciless pursuit.\r\n\r\nDimly the man and woman, up aloft, saw things that ran and shrieked\r\nand were cut down--saw things, there in the forest, that died even as\r\nthey killed, and mingled the howl of triumph with the bubbling gasp of\r\ndissolution.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh! A beast war!\" shuddered the engineer, at length, drawing\r\nBeatrice away from the window. \"Come, it's getting light, again. It's\r\ntoo clear, now--come away!\"\r\n\r\nShe yielded, waking as it were from the horrid fascination that had\r\nheld her spell-bound. Down she sat on her bed of furs, covered her\r\neyes with her hands, and for a while remained quite motionless. Stern\r\nwatched her. And again his hand sought the revolver-butt.\r\n\r\n\"I ought to have waded into that bunch, long ago,\" thought he. \"We\r\nboth ought to have. What it's all about, who could tell? But it's an\r\noutrage against the night itself, against the world, even dead though\r\nit be. If it hadn't been for wasting good ammunition for nothing--!\"\r\n\r\nA curious, guttural whine, down there in the forest, attracted his\r\nattention. Over to the window he strode, and once again peered down.\r\n\r\nA change had come upon the scene, a sudden, radical change. No more\r\nthe sounds of combat rose; but now a dull, conclamant murmur as of\r\nvictory and preparation for some ghastly rite.\r\n\r\nAlready in the center of the wood, hard by the spring, a little fire\r\nhad been lighted. Even as Stern looked, dim, moving figures heaped on\r\nwood. The engineer saw whirling droves of sparks spiral upward; he saw\r\ndense smoke, followed by a larger flame.\r\n\r\nAnd, grouped around this, already some hundreds of the now paling\r\ntorches cast their livid glare.\r\n\r\nOff to one side he could just distinguish what seemed to be a group\r\nengaged in some activity--but what this might be, he could not\r\ndetermine. Yet, all at once a scream of pain burst out, therefrom; and\r\nthen a gasping cry that ended quickly and did not come again.\r\n\r\nAnother shriek, and still a third; and now into the leaping flames\r\nsome dark, misshapen things were flung, and a great shout arose.\r\n\r\nThen rose, also, a shrill, singsong whine; and suddenly drams roared,\r\nnow with a different cadence.\r\n\r\n\"Hark!\" said the engineer. \"The torchmen must have exterminated the\r\nother bunch, and got possession of the drums. They're using 'em,\r\nthemselves--and badly!\"\r\n\r\nBy the firelight vague shapes came and went, their shadows grotesquely\r\nflung against the leafy screens. The figures quickened their paces and\r\ntheir gestures; then suddenly, with cries, flung themselves into wild\r\nactivity. And all about the fire, Stern saw a wheeling, circling,\r\neddying mob of black and frightful shapes.\r\n\r\n\"The swine!\" he breathed. \"Wait--wait till I make a pint or two of\r\nPulverite!\"\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke, the concourse grew quiet with expectancy. A silence\r\nfell upon the forest. Something was being led forward toward the\r\nfire--something, for which the others all made way.\r\n\r\nThe wind freshened. With it, increased the volume of smoke. Another\r\nfrightened bird, cheeping forlornly, fluttered above the tree-tops.\r\n\r\nThen rose a cry, a shriek long-drawn and ghastly, that climbed till it\r\nbroke in a bubbling, choking gasp.\r\n\r\nCame a sharp clicking sound, a quick scuffle, a grunt; then silence\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nAnd all at once the drums crashed; and the dance began again, madder,\r\nmore obscenely hideous than ever.\r\n\r\n\"Voodoo!\" gulped Stern. \"Obeah-work! And--and the quicker I get my\r\nPulverite to working, the better!\"\r\n\r\nUndecided no longer, determined now on a course of definite action\r\nwithout further delay, the engineer turned back into the room. Upon\r\nhis forehead stood a cold and prickling sweat, of horror and disgust.\r\nBut to his lips he forced a smile, as, in the half light of the red\r\nand windy dawn, he drew close to Beatrice.\r\n\r\nThen all at once, to his unspeakable relief, he saw the girl was\r\nsleeping.\r\n\r\nUtterly worn out, exhausted and spent with the long strain, the\r\nterrible fatigues of the past thirty-six hours, she had lain down and\r\nhad dropped off to sleep. There she lay at full length. Very beautiful\r\nshe looked, half seen in the morning gloom. One arm crossed her full\r\nbosom; the other pillowed her cheek. And, bending close, Stern watched\r\nher a long minute.\r\n\r\nWith strange emotion he heard her even breathing; he caught the\r\nperfume of her warm, ripe womanhood. Never had she seemed to him so\r\nperfect, so infinitely to be loved, to be desired.\r\n\r\nAnd at thought of that beast-horde in the wood below, at realization\r\nof what _might_ be, if they two should chance to be discovered and\r\nmade captive, his face went hard as iron. An ugly, savage look\r\npossessed him, and he clenched both fists.\r\n\r\nFor a brief second he stooped still closer; he laid his lips\r\nsoundlessly, gently upon her hair. And when again he stood up, the\r\nlook in his eyes boded scant good to anything that might threaten the\r\nsleeping girl.\r\n\r\n\"So, now to work!\" said he.\r\n\r\nInto his own room he stepped quietly, his room where he had collected\r\nhis various implements and chemicals. First of all he set out, on the\r\nfloor, a two-quart copper tea-kettle; and beside this, choosing\r\ncarefully, he ranged the necessary ingredients for a \"making\" of his\r\nsecret explosive.\r\n\r\n\"Now, the wash-out water,\" said he, taking another larger dish.\r\n\r\nOver to the water-pail he walked. Then he stopped, suddenly, frowning\r\na black and puzzled frown.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" he exclaimed. \"But--there isn't a pint left, all together!\r\nHem! Now then, here _is_ a situation.\"\r\n\r\nHastily he recalled how the great labors of the previous day, the\r\nwireless experiments and all, had prevented him from going out to the\r\nspring to replenish his supply. Now, though he bitterly cursed himself\r\nfor his neglect, that did no good. The fact remained, there was no\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"Scant pint, maybe!\" said he. \"And I've got to have a gallon, at the\r\nvery least. To say nothing of drink for two people! _And_ the horde,\r\nthere, camping round the spring. Je-ru-salem!\"\r\n\r\nSoftly he whistled to himself; then, trying to solve this vital,\r\nunexpected problem, fell to pacing the floor.\r\n\r\nDay, slowly looming through the window, showed his features set and\r\nhard. Close at hand, the breath of morning winds stirred the treetops.\r\nBut of the usual busy twitter and gossip of birds among the branches,\r\nnow there was none. For down below there, in the forest, the ghoulish\r\nvampire revels still held sway.\r\n\r\nStern, at a loss, swore hotly under his breath.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he found himself; he came to a decision.\r\n\r\n\"_I'm_ going down,\" he vowed. \"I'm going down, to _see!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SUPREME QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that his course lay clear before him, the man felt an\r\ninstant and a huge relief. Whatever the risks, the dangers, this\r\nadventuring was better than a mere inaction, besieged there in the\r\ntower by that ugly, misshapen horde.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, as he had done on the first morning of the awakening,\r\nwhen he had left the girl asleep, he wrote a brief communication to\r\nforestall any possible alarm on her part. This, scrawled with charcoal\r\non a piece of smooth hide, ran:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Have had to go down to get water and lay of the land. Absolutely\r\nnecessary. Don't be afraid. Am between you and them, well armed. Will\r\nleave you both the rifle and the shotgun. Stay here, and have no fear.\r\nWill come back as soon as possible. ALLAN.\"\r\n\r\nHe laid this primitive letter where, on awakening, she could not fail\r\nto see it. Then, making sure again that all the arms were fully\r\ncharged, he put the rifle and the gun close beside his \"note,\" and saw\r\nto it that his revolvers lay loosely and conveniently in the holsters\r\nshe had made for him.\r\n\r\nOne more reconnaissance he made at the front window. This done, he\r\ntook the water-pail and set off quietly down the stairs. His feet were\r\nnoiseless as a cat's.\r\n\r\nAt every landing he stopped, listening intently. Down, ever down,\r\nstory by story he crept.\r\n\r\nTo his chagrin--though he had half expected worse--he found that the\r\nboiler-explosion of the previous night had really made the way\r\nimpassible, from the third story downward. These lowest flights of\r\nsteps had been so badly broken, that now they gave no access to the\r\narcade.\r\n\r\nAll that remained of them was a jumbled mass of wreckage, below the\r\ngaping hole in the third-floor hallway.\r\n\r\n\"_That_ means,\" said Stern to himself, \"I've got to find another way\r\ndown. And quick, too!\"\r\n\r\nHe set about the task with a will. Exploration of several lateral\r\ncorridors resulted in nothing; but at last good fortune led him to\r\nstairs that had remained comparatively uninjured. And down these he\r\nstole, pail in one hand, revolver ready in the other, listening,\r\ncreeping, every sense alert.\r\n\r\nHe found himself, at length, in the shattered and dismembered wreckage\r\nof the once-famed \"Marble Court.\" Fallen now were the carved and\r\ngilded pillars; gone, save here or there for a fragment, the wondrous\r\nbalustrade. One of the huge newel-posts at the bottom lay on the\r\ncracked floor of marble squares; the other, its metal chandelier still\r\nclinging to it, lolled drunkenly askew.\r\n\r\nBut Stern had neither time nor inclination to observe these woful\r\nchanges. Instead, he pressed still forward, and, after a certain time\r\nof effort, found himself in the arcade once more.\r\n\r\nHere the effects of the explosion were very marked. A ghastly hole\r\nopened into the subcellar below; masses of fallen ceiling blocked the\r\nway; and every pane of glass in the shop-fronts had shattered down.\r\nSmoke had blackened everything. Ashes and dirt, ad infinitum,\r\ncompleted the dreary picture, seen there by the still insufficient\r\nlight of morning.\r\n\r\nBut Stern cared nothing for all this. It even cheered him a trifle.\r\n\r\n\"In case of a mix-up,\" thought he, \"there couldn't be a better place\r\nfor ambushing these infernal cannibals--for mowing them down,\r\nwholesale--for sending them skyhooting to Tophet, in bunches!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a grim smile, he worked his way cautiously toward Madison\r\nForest and the pine-tree gate.\r\n\r\nAs he drew near, his care redoubled. His grip on the revolver-butt\r\ntightened.\r\n\r\n\"They mustn't see me--_first!_\" said he to himself.\r\n\r\nInto a littered wreck of an office at the right of the exit he\r\nsilently crept. Here, he knew, the outer wall of the building was\r\ndeeply fissured. He hoped he might be able to find some peep-hole\r\nwhere, unseen, he could peer out on the bestial mob.\r\n\r\nHe set his water-pail down, and on hands and knees, hardly breathing,\r\ntaking infinite pains not to stir the loose rubbish on the floor, not\r\neven to crunch the fallen lumps of mortar, forward he crawled.\r\n\r\nYes, there _was_ a glimmer of light through the crack in the wall.\r\nStern silently wormed in between a corroded steel I-beam and a cracked\r\ngranite block, about the edges of which the small green tendrils of a\r\nvine had laid their hold.\r\n\r\nThis way, then that, he craned his neck. And all at once, with a sharp\r\nbreath, he grew rigid in horrified, eager attention.\r\n\r\n\"Great Lord!\" he whispered. \"_What?_\"\r\n\r\nThough, from the upper stories and by torch-light, he had already\r\nformed some notion of the Horde, he had in no wise been prepared for\r\nwhat he now was actually beholding through a screen of sumacs that\r\ngrew along the wall outside.\r\n\r\n\"Why--why, this can't be real!\" thought he. \"It--must be some damned\r\nhallucination. Eh? Am I awake? What the deuce!\"\r\n\r\nPaling a little, his eyes staring, mouth agape, the engineer stayed\r\nthere for a long minute unable to credit his own senses. For now he,\r\nhe, the only white man living in the twenty-eighth century, was\r\nwitnessing the strangest sight that ever a civilized being had looked\r\nupon in the whole history of the world.\r\n\r\nNo vision of DeQuincey, no drug-born dream of Poe could equal it for\r\ngrisly fascination. Frankenstein, de Maupassant's \"Horla,\" all the\r\nfantastic literary monsters of the past faded to tawdry, childish\r\nbogeys beside the actual observations of Stern, the engineer, the man\r\nof science and cold fact.\r\n\r\n\"Why--what _are_ these?\" he asked himself, shuddering despite himself\r\nat the mere sight of what lay outside there in the forest. \"What? Men?\r\nAnimals? Neither! God help me, what--_what are these things?_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE UNKNOWN RACE\r\n\r\n\r\nAn almost irresistible repugnance, a compelling aversion, more\r\nof the spirit than of the flesh, instantly seized the man at sight of\r\neven the few members of the Horde which lay within his view.\r\n\r\nThough he had been expecting to see something disgusting, something\r\ngrotesque and horrible, his mind was wholly unprepared for the real\r\nhideousness of these creatures, now seen by the ever-strengthening\r\nlight of day.\r\n\r\nAnd slowly, as he stared, the knowledge dawned on him that here was a\r\nmonstrous problem to face, far greater and more urgent than he had\r\nforeseen; here were factors not yet understood; here, the product of\r\nforces till then not even dreamed of by his scientific mind.\r\n\r\n\"I--I certainly did expect to find a small race,\" thought he. \"Small,\r\nand possibly misshapen, the descendants, maybe, of a few survivors of\r\nthe cataclysm. But _this--!_\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, fascinated by the ghastly spectacle, he laid his eye to the\r\nchink in the wall, and looked.\r\n\r\nA tenuous fog still drifted slowly among the forest trees, veiling the\r\ndeeper recesses. Yet, near at hand, within the limited segment of\r\nvision which the engineer commanded, everything could be made out with\r\nreasonable distinctness.\r\n\r\nSome of the Things (for so he mentally named them, knowing no better\r\nterm) were squatting, lying or moving about, quite close at hand. The\r\nfire by the spring had now almost died down. It was evident that the\r\nrevel had ceased, and that the Horde was settling down to\r\nrest--glutted, no doubt, with the raw and bleeding flesh of the\r\nconquered foe.\r\n\r\nStern could easily have poked his pistol muzzle through the crack in\r\nthe wall and shot down many of them. For an instant the temptation lay\r\nstrong upon him to get rid of at least a dozen or a score; but\r\nprudence restrained his hand.\r\n\r\n\"No use!\" he told himself. \"Nothing to be gained by that. But, once I\r\nget my proper chance at them--!\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, striving to observe them with the cool and calculating eye\r\nof science, he studied the shifting, confused picture out there before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThen he realized that the feature which, above all else, struck him as\r\nghastly and unnatural, was the _color_ of the Things.\r\n\r\n\"Not black, not even brown,\" said he. \"I thought so, last night, but\r\ndaylight corrects the impression. Not red, either, or copper-colored.\r\n_What_ color, then? For Heaven's sake, what?\"\r\n\r\nHe could hardly name it. Through the fog, it struck him as a dull\r\nslate-gray, almost a blue. He recalled that once he had seen a child's\r\nmodeling-clay, much-used and very dirty, of the same shade, which\r\ncertainly had no designation in the chromatic scale. Some of the\r\nThings were darker, some a trifle lighter--these, no doubt, the\r\nyounger ones--but they all partook of this same characteristic tint.\r\nAnd the skin, moreover, looked dull and sickly, rather mottled and\r\nwholly repulsive, very like that of a Mexican dog.\r\n\r\nLike that dog's hide, too, it was sparsely overgrown with whitish\r\nbristles. Here or there, on the bodies of some of the larger Things,\r\nbulbous warts had formed, somewhat like those on a toad's back; and on\r\nthese warts the bristles clustered thickly. Stern saw the hair, on the\r\nneck of one of these creatures, crawl and rise like a jackal's, as a\r\nneighbor jostled him; and from the Thing's throat issued a clicking\r\ngrunt of purely animal resentment.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Heavens! What _are_ they?\" wondered Stern, again, utterly\r\nbaffled for any explanation. \"What _can_ they be?\"\r\n\r\nAnother, in the group close by, attracted his attention. It was lying\r\non its side, asleep maybe, its back directly toward the engineer.\r\nStern clearly saw the narrow shoulders and the thin, long arms,\r\ncovered with that white bristling hair.\r\n\r\nOne sprawling, spatulate, clawlike hand lay on the forest moss. The\r\ntwisted little apelike legs, disproportionately short, were curled up;\r\nthe feet, prehensile and with a well-marked thumb on each, twitched a\r\nlittle now and then. The head, enormously too big for the body, to\r\nwhich it was joined by a thin neck, seemed to be scantily covered with\r\na fine, curling down, of a dirty yellowish drab color.\r\n\r\n\"What a target!\" thought the engineer. \"At this distance, with my .38,\r\nI could drill it without half trying!\"\r\n\r\nAll at once, another of the group sat up, shoved away a burned-out\r\ntorch, and yawned with a noisy, doglike whine Stern got a quick yet\r\ndefinite glimpse of the sharp canine teeth; he saw that the Thing's\r\nfleshless lips and retreating chin were caked with dried blood. The\r\ntongue he saw was long and lithe and apparently rasped.\r\n\r\nThen the creature stood up, balancing on its absurd bandy legs, a\r\nspear in its hand--a flint-pointed spear of crude workmanship.\r\n\r\nAt full sight of the face, Stern shrank for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"I've known savages, as such,\" thought he. \"I understand them. I know\r\nanimals. They're animals, that's all. But _this_ creature--merciful\r\nHeaven!\"\r\n\r\nAnd at the realization that it was neither beast nor man, the\r\nengineer's blood chilled within his veins.\r\n\r\nYet he forced himself still to look and to observe, unseen. There was\r\npractically no forehead at all. The nose was but a formless lump of\r\ncartilage, the ears large and pendulous and hairy. Under heavy\r\nbrow-ridges, the dull, lackluster eyes blinked stupidly, bloodshot and\r\ncruel. As the mouth closed, Stern noted how the under incisors closed\r\nup over the upper lip, showing a gleam of dull yellowish ivory; a\r\nslaver dripped from the doglike corner of the mouth.\r\n\r\nStern shivered, and drew back.\r\n\r\nHe realized now that he was in the presence of an unknown semi-human\r\ntype, different in all probability from any that had ever yet existed.\r\nIt was less their bestiality that disgusted him, than their utter,\r\nhopeless, age-long degeneration from the man-standard.\r\n\r\nWhat race had they descended from? He could not tell. He thought he\r\ncould detect a trace of the Mongol in the region of the eye, in the\r\ncheek-bones and the general contour of what, by courtesy, might be\r\ncalled the face. There were indications, also, of the negroid type,\r\nstill stronger. But the color--whence could _that_ have come? And the\r\ngeneral characteristics, were not these distinctly simian?\r\n\r\nAgain he looked. And now one of the pot-bellied little horrors,\r\nshambling and bulbous-kneed, was scratching its warty, blue hide with\r\nits black claws as it trailed along through the forest. It looked up,\r\ngrinning and jabbering; Stern saw the teeth that should have been\r\nmolars. With repulsion he noted that they were not flat-crowned, but\r\nsharp like a dog's. Through the blue lips they clearly showed.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing herbivorous here,\" thought the scientist. \"All flesh--food\r\nof--who knows what sort!\"\r\n\r\nQuickly his mind ran over the outlines of the problem. He knew at once\r\nthat these Things were lower than any human race ever recorded, far\r\nlower even than the famed Australian bushmen, who could not even count\r\nas high as five. Yet, strange and more than strange, they had the use\r\nof fire, of the tom-tom, of some sort of voodooism, of flint, of\r\nspears, and of a rude sort of tanning--witness the loin-clouts of hide\r\nwhich they all wore.\r\n\r\n\"Worse than any troglodyte!\" he told himself. \"Far lower than De\r\nQuatrefage's Neanderthal man, to judge from the cephalic index--worse\r\nthan that Java skull, the pithecanthropus erectus, itself! And I am\r\nwith my living eyes beholding them!\"\r\n\r\nA slight sound, there behind him in the room, set his heart flailing\r\nmadly.\r\n\r\nHis hand froze to the butt of the automatic as he drew back from the\r\ncleft in the wall, and, staring, whirled about, ready to shoot on the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThen he started back. His jaw dropped, his eyes widened and limply\r\nfell his arm. The pistol swung loosely at his side.\r\n\r\n\"_You?_--\" he soundlessly breathed, \"You--_here?_\"\r\n\r\nThere at the door of the great empty room, magnificent m her\r\ntiger-skin, the Krag gripped in her supple hand, stood Beatrice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE CURIOSITY OF EVE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt him the girl peered eagerly, a second, as though to make\r\nquite sure he was not hurt in any way, to satisfy herself that he was\r\nsafe and sound.\r\n\r\nThen with a little gasp of relief, she ran to him. Her sandaled feet\r\nlightly disturbed the rubbish on the floor; dust rose. Stern checked\r\nher with an upraised hand.\r\n\r\n\"Back! Back! Go back, quick!\" he formed the words of command on his\r\ntrembling lips. The idea of this girl's close proximity to the\r\nbeast-horde terrified him, for the moment. \"Back! What on earth are\r\nyou _here_ for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I woke up. I found you gone!\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but didn't you read my letter? _This_ is no place for you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I had to come! How could I stay up there, alone, when you--were--oh!\r\nmaybe in danger--maybe in need of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" he commanded, in his perturbation heedless of the look she\r\ngave him. He took her hand. \"Come, we must get out of this! It's\r\ntoo--too near the--\"\r\n\r\n\"The _what?_ What _is_ it, Allan? Tell me, have you seen them? Do you\r\nknow?\"\r\n\r\nEven excited as the engineer was, he realized that for the first time\r\nthe girl had called him by his Christian name. Not even the perilous\r\nsituation could stifle the thrill that ran through him at the sound of\r\nit. But all he answered was:\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't know _what_ to call them. Have no idea, as yet. I've seen\r\nthem, yes; but what they are, Heaven knows--maybe!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see, too!\" she pleaded eagerly. \"Is it through that crack in\r\nthe wall? Is that the place to look?\"\r\n\r\nShe moved toward it, her face blanched with excitement, eyes shining,\r\nlips parted. But Stern held her back. By the shoulder he took her.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, little girl!\" he whispered. \"You--you mustn't! Really must\r\n_not_, you know. It's too awful!\"\r\n\r\nUp at him she looked, knowing not what to think or say for a moment.\r\nTheir eyes met, there in that wrecked and riven place, lighted by the\r\ndull, misty, morning gray. Then Stern spoke, for in her gaze abode\r\nquestions unnumbered.\r\n\r\n\"I'd much rather you wouldn't look out at them, not just yet,\" said\r\nhe, speaking very low, fearful lest the murmur of his voice might\r\npenetrate the wall. \"Just what they are, frankly, there's no telling.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come back into the arcade, where we'll be safer from discovery, and\r\nwe can talk. Not here. Come!\"\r\n\r\nShe obeyed. Together they retreated to the inner court.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he commented, nodding at the empty water-pail, \"I haven't\r\nbeen to the spring yet. Not very likely to get there for a while,\r\neither, unless--well, unless something pretty radical happens. I think\r\nthese chaps have settled down for a good long stay in their happy\r\nhunting-ground, after the fight and the big feast. It's sort of a\r\nnotion I've got, that this place, here, is some ancient, ceremonial\r\nground of theirs.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean, on account of the tower?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if they've got any religious ideas at all, or rather\r\nsuperstitions, such would very likely center round the most\r\nconspicuous object in their world. Probably the spring is a regular\r\nvoodoo hangout. The row, last night, must have been a sort of periodic\r\nargument to see who was going to run the show.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" exclaimed the girl, in alarm--\"but if they _do_ stay a while,\r\nwhat about us? We simply must have water!\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough. And, inasmuch as we can't drink brine and don't know\r\nwhere there's any other spring, it looks as though we'd either have to\r\nmake up to these fellows or wade into them, doesn't it? But we'll get\r\nwater safe enough, never fear. Just now, for the immediate present, I\r\nwant to get my bearings a little, before going to work. _They_ seem to\r\nbe resting up, a bit, after their pleasant little soiree. Now, if\r\nthey'd only all go to sleep, it'd be a walk-over!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at him, very seriously.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't go out there alone, whatever happens!\" she exclaimed. \"I\r\njust won't let you! But tell me,\" she questioned again, \"how much have\r\nyou really found out about them--whatever they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much. They seem to be part of a nomadic race of half-human\r\nthings, that's about all I can tell as yet. Perhaps all the white and\r\nyellow peoples perished utterly in the cataclysm, leaving only a few\r\nscattered blacks. You know blacks _are_ immune to several\r\ngerm-infections that destroy other races.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And you mean--?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's quite possible these fellows are the far-distant and degenerate\r\nsurvivors of that other time.\"\r\n\r\n\"So the whole world may have gone to pieces the way Liberia and Haiti\r\nand Santo Domingo once did, when white rule ceased?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, only a million times more so. I see you know your history! _If_\r\nmy hypothesis is correct, and only a few thousand blacks escaped, you\r\ncan easily imagine what must have happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"For a while, maybe fifty or a hundred years, they may have kept some\r\nsort of dwindling civilization. Probably the English language for a\r\nwhile continued, in ever more and more corrupt forms. There may have\r\nbeen some pretense of maintaining the school system, railroads,\r\nsteamship lines, newspapers and churches, banks and all the rest of\r\nthat wonderfully complex system we once knew. But after a while--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes? What _then?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the whole false shell crumbled, that's all. It must have!\r\nHistory shows it. It didn't take a hundred years after Toussaint\r\nL'Ouverture and Dessalines, in Haiti, for the blacks to shuck off\r\nFrench civilization and go back to grass huts and human sacrifice--to\r\nmake another little Central Africa out of it, in the backwoods\r\ndistricts, at any rate. And _we_--have had a thousand, Beatrice, since\r\nthe white man died!\"\r\n\r\nShe thought a moment, and shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"What a story,\" she murmured, \"what an incredible, horribly\r\nfascinating story that would make, if it could ever be known, or\r\nwritten! Think of the ebb-tide of everything! Railroads abandoned and\r\nfalling to pieces, cities crumbling, ships no longer sailing, language\r\nand arts and letters forgotten, agriculture shrinking back to a few\r\npatches of corn and potatoes, and then to nothing at all, everything\r\nchanging, dying, stopping--and the ever-increasing yet degenerating\r\npeople leaving the city ruins, which they could not rebuild--taking to\r\nthe fields, the forests, the mountains--going down, down, back toward\r\nthe primeval state, down through barbarism, through savagery,\r\nto--what?\"\r\n\r\n\"To what we see!\" answered the engineer, bitterly. \"To animals,\r\nretaining by ghastly mockery some use of fire and of tools. All this,\r\naccording to _one_ theory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there another?\" she asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I wish we had the shade of Darwin, of Haeckel or of Clodd\r\nhere with us to help us work it out!\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you imagine it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, like this. Maybe, after all, even the entire black race was\r\nswept out along with the others, too. Perhaps you and I were really\r\nthe only two human beings left alive in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but in that case, how--?\"\r\n\r\n\"How came _they_ here? Listen! May they not be the product of some\r\nentirely different process of development? May not some animal stock,\r\nunder changed environment, have easily evolved them? May not some\r\nother semi-human or near-human race be now in process of arising, here\r\non earth, eventually to conquer and subdue it all again?\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment she made no answer. Her breath came a little quickly as\r\nshe tried to grasp the full significance of this tremendous concept.\r\n\r\n\"In a million years, or so,\" the engineer continued, \"may not the\r\ndescendants of these things once more be men, or something very like\r\nthem? In other words, aren't we possibly witnessing the recreation of\r\nthe human type? Aren't _these_ the real pithecanthropi erecti,\r\nrather than the brown-skinned, reddish-haired creatures of the\r\nbiological text-books? There's our problem!\"\r\n\r\nShe made no answer, but a sudden overmastering curiosity leaped into\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see them for myself! I must! I will!\"\r\n\r\nAnd before he could detain her, the girl had started back into the\r\nroom whence they had come.\r\n\r\n\"No, no! No, Beatrice!\" he whispered, but she paid no heed to him.\r\nAcross the littered floor she made her way. And by the time Stern\r\ncould reach her side, she had set her face to the long, crumbling\r\ncrack in the wall and with a burning eagerness was peering out into\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nEVE BECOMES AN AMAZON\r\n\r\n\r\nStern laid a hand on her shoulder, striving to draw her away.\r\nThis spectacle, it seemed to him, was no fit sight for her to gaze on.\r\nBut she shrugged her shoulders as if to say: \"I'm not a child! I'm\r\nyour equal, now, and I must see!\" So the engineer desisted. And he,\r\ntoo, set his eye to the twisting aperture.\r\n\r\nAt sight of the narrow segment of forest visible through it, and of\r\nthe several members of the Horde, a strong revulsion came upon him.\r\n\r\nUp welled a deep-seated love for the memory of the race of men and\r\nwomen as they once had been--the people of the other days. Stern\r\nalmost seemed to behold them again, those tall, athletic,\r\nstraight-limbed men; those lithe, deep-breasted women, fair-skinned\r\nand with luxuriant hair; all alike now plunged for a thousand years in\r\nthe abyss of death and of eternal oblivion.\r\n\r\nNever before had the engineer realized how dear, how infinitely close\r\nto him his own race had been. Never had he so admired its diverse\r\ntypes of force and beauty, as now, now when all were but a dream.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh!\" thought he, disgusted beyond measure at the sight before him.\r\n\"And all _these_ things are just as much alike as so many ants in a\r\nhill! I question if they've got the reason and the socialized\r\nintelligence of ants!\"\r\n\r\nHe heard the girl breathe quick, as she, too, watched what was going\r\non outside. A certain change had taken place there. The mist had\r\nsomewhat thinned away, blown by the freshening breeze through Madison\r\nForest and by the higher-rising sun. Both watchers could new see\r\nfurther into the woods; and both perceived that the Horde was for the\r\nmost part disposing itself to sleep.\r\n\r\nOnly a few vague, uncertain figures were now moving about, with a\r\nstrangely unsteady gait, weak-kneed and simian.\r\n\r\nIn the nearest group, which Stern had already had a chance to study,\r\nall save one of the creatures had lain down. The man and woman could\r\nquite plainly hear the raucous and bestial snoring of some half-dozen\r\nof the gorged Things.\r\n\r\n\"Come away, you've seen enough, more than enough!\" he whispered in the\r\ngirl's ear.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" she answered, under her breath. \"How horrible--and yet, how\r\nwonderful!\"\r\n\r\nThen a misfortune happened; trivial yet how direly pregnant!\r\n\r\nFor Stern, trying to readjust his position, laid his right hand on the\r\nwall above his head.\r\n\r\nA little fragment of loose marble, long since ready to fall, dislodged\r\nitself and bounced with a sharp click against the steel I-beam over\r\nwhich they were both peeking.\r\n\r\nThe sound, perhaps, was no greater than you would make in snapping an\r\nordinary lead-pencil in your fingers; yet on the instant three of the\r\nThings raised their bulbous and exaggerated heads in an attitude of\r\nintense, suspicious listening. Plain to see that their senses, at\r\nleast, excelled those of the human being, even as a dog's might.\r\n\r\nThe individual which, alone of them all, had been standing, wheeled\r\nsuddenly round and made a step or two toward the building. Both\r\nwatchers saw him with terrible distinctness, there among the sumacs\r\nand birches, with the beauty of which he made a shocking contrast.\r\n\r\nPlain now was the simian aspect, plain the sidelong and uncertain\r\ngait, bent back and crooked legs, the long, pendulous arms and dully\r\nferocious face.\r\n\r\nAnd as the Thing listened, its hair bristling, it thrust its\r\nvillainous, apelike head well forward. Open fell the mouth, revealing\r\nthe dog-teeth and the blue, shriveled-looking gums.\r\n\r\nA wrinkle creased the low, dull brow. Watching with horrified\r\nfascination, Stern and Beatrice beheld--and heard--the creature sniff\r\nthe air, as though taking up some scent of danger or of the hunt.\r\n\r\nThen up came the right arm; they saw the claw-hand with a spear, poise\r\nitself a moment. From the open mouth burst with astounding force and\r\nsuddenness a snarling yowl, inarticulate, shrill, horrible beyond all\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nAn instant agitation took place all through the forest. The watchers\r\ncould see only a small, fan-like space of it--and even this, only a\r\nfew rods from the building--yet by the confused, vague noise that\r\nbegan, they knew the alarm had been given to the whole Horde.\r\n\r\nHere, there, the cry was repeated. A shifting, moving sound began. In\r\nthe visible group, the Things were getting to their handlike feet,\r\nstanding unsteadily on their loose-skinned, scaly legs, gawping about\r\nthem, whining and clicking with disgusting sounds.\r\n\r\nSudden, numbing fear seized Beatrice. Now for the first time she\r\nrealized the imminent peril; now she regretted her insistence on\r\nseeing the Horde at close range.\r\n\r\nShe turned, pale and shaken; and her trembling hand sought the\r\nengineer's.\r\n\r\nHe still, for a moment, kept his eye to the crack, fascinated by the\r\nvery horror of the sight. Then all at once another figure shambled\r\ninto view.\r\n\r\n\"A female one!\" he realized, shuddering. Too monstrously hideous, this\r\nsight, to be endured. With a gasp, the man turned back.\r\n\r\nAbout Beatrice he drew his arm. Together, almost as soundlessly as\r\nwraiths, they stole away, out through the office, out to the hallway,\r\ninto the dim light of the arcade once more.\r\n\r\nHere, for a few moments, they knew that they were safe. Retreat\r\nthrough the Marble Court and up the stairs was fairly clear. There was\r\nbut one entrance open into the arcade, the one through Pine Tree Gate;\r\nand this was blocked so narrowly by the giant bole that Stern knew\r\nthere could be no general mob-rush through it--no attack which he\r\ncould not for a while hold back, so long as his ammunition and the\r\ngirl's should last.\r\n\r\nThus they breathed more freely now. Most of the tumult outside had\r\nbeen cut off from their hearing, by the retirement into the arcade.\r\nThey paused, to plan their course.\r\n\r\nAt Stern the girl looked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, oh, Allan--how horrible!\" she whispered. \"It was all my fault for\r\nhaving been so headstrong, for having insisted on a look at them!\r\nForgive me!\"\r\n\r\n\"S-h!\" he cautioned again. \"No matter about that. The main thing, now,\r\nis whether we attack or wait?\"\r\n\r\n\"Attack? Now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think much of going up-stairs without that pail of water.\r\nWe'll have a frightful time with thirst, to say nothing of not being\r\nable to make the Pulverite. Water we must have! If it weren't for your\r\nbeing here, I'd mighty soon wade into that bunch and see who wins!\r\nBut--well, I haven't any right to endanger--\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice seized his hand and pulled him toward the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" cried she. \"If you and I aren't a match for _them_, we\r\ndon't deserve to live, that's all. You know how I can shoot now! Come\r\nalong!\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes gleamed with the light of battle, battle for liberty, for\r\nlife; her cheeks glowed with the tides of generous blood that coursed\r\nbeneath the skin. Never had Stern beheld her half so beautiful, so\r\nregal in that clinging, barbaric Bengal robe of black and yellow,\r\ncaught at the throat with the clasp of raw gold.\r\n\r\nA sudden impulse seized him, dominant, resistless. For a brief moment\r\nhe detained her; he held her back; about her supple body his arm\r\ntightened.\r\n\r\nShe raised her face in wonder. He bent, a little, and on the brow he\r\nkissed her rapturously.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God for such a comrade and a--friend!\" said he.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nGODS!\r\n\r\n\r\nSome few minutes later, together they approached Pine Tree\r\nGate, leading directly out into the Horde.\r\n\r\nThe girl, rosier than ever, held her Krag loosely in the hollow of her\r\nbare, warm right arm. One of Stern's revolvers lay in its holster. The\r\nother balanced itself in his right hand. His left held the precious\r\nwater-pail, so vital now to all their plans and hopes.\r\n\r\nGirt in his garb of fur, belted and sandaled, well over six feet tall\r\nand broad of shoulder, the man was magnificent. His red beard and\r\nmustache, close-cropped, gave him a savage air that now well fitted\r\nhim. For Stern was mad--mad clear through.\r\n\r\nThat Beatrice should suffer in any way, even from temporary thirst,\r\nraised up a savage resentment in his breast. The thought that perhaps\r\nit might _not_ be possible to gain access to the spring at all, that\r\nthese foul Things might try to blockade them and siege them to death,\r\nwrought powerfully on him.\r\n\r\nFor himself he cared nothing. The girl it was who now preoccupied his\r\nevery thought. And as they made their way through the litter of the\r\nexplosion, toward the exit, slowly and cautiously, he spied out every\r\nfoot of the place for possible danger.\r\n\r\nIf fight he must, he knew now it would be a brutal, utterly merciless\r\nfight--slaughter, extermination without any limit, to the end.\r\n\r\nBut there was scant time for thought. Already they could see daylight\r\nglimmering in through the gate, past me massive column of the conifer.\r\nDaylight--and with it came a thin and acrid smoke--and sounds of the\r\nuproused Horde in Madison Forest.\r\n\r\n\"Slow! Slow, now!\" whispered Stern. \"Don't let 'em know a thing until\r\nwe've got 'em covered! If we surprise 'em just right, who knows but\r\nthe whole infernal mob may duck and run? Don't shoot till you have to;\r\nbut when you _do_--!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know!\" breathed she.\r\n\r\nThen, all at once, there they were at the gate, at the big tree,\r\nstanding out there in the open, on the thick carpet of pine-spills.\r\n\r\nAnd before them lay the mossy, shaded forest aisles--with what a\r\nhorror camped all through that peaceful, wondrous place!\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" gasped Beatrice. The engineer stopped as though frozen. His hand\r\ntightened on the revolver-butt till the knuckles whitened. And thus,\r\nface to face with the Horde, they stood for a long minute.\r\n\r\nNeither of them realized exactly the details of that first impression.\r\nThe narrow slit of view which they had already got through the crack\r\nin the wall had only very imperfectly prepared them for any\r\nunderstanding of what these Things really were, en masse.\r\n\r\nBut both Beatrice and the engineer understood, even at the first\r\nmoment of their exit there, that they had entered an adventure whereof\r\nthe end could not be foreseen; that here before them lay possibilities\r\ninfinitely more serious than any they had contemplated.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, they had underestimated the numbers of the Horde. They\r\nhad thought, perhaps, there might be five hundred in all.\r\n\r\nThe torches had certainly numbered no more than that. But now they\r\nrealized that the torch-bearers had been but a very small fraction of\r\nthe whole; for, as their eyes swept out through the forest, whence the\r\nfog had almost wholly risen, they beheld a moving, swarming mass of\r\nthe creatures on every hand. A mass that seemed to extend on, on to\r\nindefinite vistas. A mass that moved, clicked, shifted, grunted,\r\nstank, snarled, quarreled. A mass of frightful hideousness, of\r\ninconceivable menace.\r\n\r\nThe girl's first impulse was to turn, to retreat back into the\r\nbuilding once more; but her native courage checked it. For Stern, she\r\nsaw, had no such purpose.\r\n\r\nSurprised though he was, he stood there like a rock, head up, revolver\r\nready, every muscle tense and ready for whatsoever might befall. And\r\nthrough the girl flashed a thrill of admiration for this virile,\r\nindomitable man, coping with every difficulty, facing every peril--for\r\nher sake.\r\n\r\nYet the words he uttered now were not of classic heroism. They were\r\nsimple, colloquial, inelegant. For Stern, his eyes blazing, said only:\r\n\r\n\"We're in bad, girl! They're on--we've got to bluff--bluff like the\r\ndevil!\"\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen a herd of cattle on the prairie, a herd of\r\nthousands, shift and face and, as by instinct, lower their horned\r\nheads against some enemy--a wolf-pack, maybe?\r\n\r\nYou know then, how this Horde of dwarfish, blue, warty, misformed\r\nlittle horrors woke to the presence of the unknown enemy.\r\n\r\nAlready half alarmed by the warning given by the one, which, near the\r\ncrack in the wall, had sniffed the intruders and had howled, the pack\r\nnow broke into commotion. Stern and Beatrice saw a confused upheaving,\r\na shifting and a tumult. They heard a yapping outcry. The long, thin\r\nspears began to bristle.\r\n\r\nAnd all at once, as a dull, ugly hornet-hum rose through the wood,\r\nthey knew the moment for quick action was upon them.\r\n\r\n\"Here goes!\" cried Stern, raging. \"Let's see how _this_ will strike\r\nthe hell-hounds!\"\r\n\r\nHis face white with passion and with loathing hate, he raised the\r\nautomatic. He aimed at none of the pack, for angry as he was he\r\nrealized that the time was not yet come for killing, if other means to\r\nreach the spring could possibly avail.\r\n\r\nInstead he pointed the ugly blue muzzle up toward the branches of a\r\nmaple, under which a dense swarm of the Horde had encamped and now was\r\nstaring, apelike, at him.\r\n\r\nThen his finger sought the trigger. And five crackling spurts of\r\nflame, five shots spat out into the calm and misty air of morning. A\r\nfew severed leaves swayed down, idly, with a swinging motion. A broken\r\ntwig fell, hung suspended a moment, then detached itself again and\r\ncrapped to earth.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord! Look a' _that_, will you?\" cried Stern.\r\n\r\nA startled cry broke from the girl's lips.\r\n\r\nBoth of them had expected some effect from the sudden fusillade, but\r\nnothing like that which actually resulted.\r\n\r\nFor, as the quick shots echoed to stillness again, and even before the\r\nfirst of the falling leaves had spiraled to the ground, an absolute,\r\nunbroken silence fell upon that vile rabble of beast-men--the silence\r\nof a numbing, paralyzing, sheer brute terror.\r\n\r\nSome stood motionless, crouching on their bandy legs, holding to\r\nwhatsoever tree or bush was nearest, staring with wild eyes.\r\n\r\nOthers dropped to their knees.\r\n\r\nBut by far the greater part, thousands on thousands of the little\r\nmonstrosities, fell prone and grovelling. Their hideous masklike faces\r\nhidden, there they lay on the moss and all among the undergrowth, the\r\ntrampled, desecrated, befouled undergrowth of Madison Forest.\r\n\r\nThen all at once, over and beyond them, Stern saw the blue-curling\r\nsmudge of the remains of the great fire by the spring.\r\n\r\nHe knew that, for a few brief, all-precious moments, the way might\r\npossibly be clear to come and go--to get water--to save Beatrice and\r\nhimself from the thirst--tortures--to procure the one necessary thing\r\nfor the making of his Pulverite.\r\n\r\nHis heart gave a great, up-bounding leap.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Beatrice!\" cried he, his voice ringing out over the\r\nterror-stricken things. \"Look--we're gods! While this lasts--_gods!_\r\nCome, now's our only chance! _Come on!_--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE OBEAH\r\n\r\n\r\nTogether, as in a dream--a nightmare, dazed, incredible,\r\ngrotesque--they advanced out into the dim-shaded forest aisles.\r\n\r\n\"Don't look!\" Stern exclaimed, shuddering at sight of the unspeakable\r\nhideousness of the Things, at glimpses of gnawed bones, grisly bits of\r\nflesh, dried gouts of blood upon the woodland carpet. \"Don't\r\nthink--just come along!\r\n\r\n\"Five minutes, and we're safe, there and back again. S-h-h-h! Don't\r\nhurry! Count, now--count your steps--one, two, three--four, five,\r\nsix--steady, steady!--\"\r\n\r\nNow they were ten yards from the tower, now twenty. Bravely they\r\nwalked, now straight ahead among the trees, now circling some\r\nindividual, some horrid group. Stern held the water-pail firmly. He\r\ngripped the revolver in a grasp of iron. The magazine-rifle lay in\r\nboth the girl's hands, ready for instant use.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Stern fired again, three shots.\r\n\r\n\"Some of 'em are moving, over there!\" he said in a crisp, ugly tone.\r\n\"I guess a little lead close to their ears will fix 'em for a while!\"\r\n\r\nHis voice went to a hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Gods!\" he repeated. \"Don't forget it, for a moment; don't lose that\r\nthought, for it may pull us through! These creatures here, _if_\r\nthey're descended from the blacks, must have some story, some\r\ntradition of the white man. Of his mastery, his power! We'll use it\r\nnow, by Heaven, as it never yet was used!\"\r\n\r\nThen he began to count again; and so, tense, watching with\r\neager-burning eyes and taut muscles, the man and woman made their way\r\nof frightful peril.\r\n\r\nA snuffling howl rose.\r\n\r\n\"You will, will you?\" Stern cried, adding another kick to the one he\r\nhad just dealt to one of the creatures, who had ventured to look up at\r\ntheir approach. \"Lie down, ape!\" And with the clangorous metal pail he\r\nsmote the ugly, brutish skull.\r\n\r\nBeatrice gasped with fear; but the bluff made good. The creature\r\ngrovelled, and again the pair strode forward, masterfully. Masterfully\r\nthey had to go, or not at all. Masterfully, or die. For now their\r\nall-in-all lay just in that grim, steel-hard sense of mastery.\r\n\r\nBefore the girl's eyes a sort of haze seemed forming. Her heart beat\r\nthick and heavy. Stern's counting sounded very far away and strange;\r\nshe hardly recognized his voice. To her came wild, disjointed,\r\nconfused impressions--now a bony and distorted back, now a simian\r\nhead; again a group that crouched and cowered in its filthy squalor,\r\nhideously.\r\n\r\nThen all at once, there right before her she saw the little woodland\r\npath that, slightly descending, led past a big oak she well knew, down\r\nto the margin of the pool.\r\n\r\n\"Steady, girl, steady!\" came the engineer's warning, tense as\r\npiano-wire. \"Almost there, now. What's _that?_\"\r\n\r\nFor a brief instant he hesitated. The girl felt his arm grow even more\r\ntaut, she heard his breath catch. Then she, too, looked--and saw.\r\n\r\nIt was enough, that sight, to have smitten with sick horror the\r\nbravest man who ever lived. For there, beside the smouldering embers\r\nof the great feast-fire, littered with bones and indescribable refuse,\r\na creature was squatting on its hams--one of the Horde, indeed, yet\r\nvastly different, tremendously more venomous, more dangerous of\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nStern knew at once that here, not prostrate nor yet crouching, was the\r\nchief of the blue Horde.\r\n\r\nHe knew it by the superior size and strength of the Thing, by the\r\nalmost manlike cunning of the low, gorilla face, the gleam of\r\nintelligence in the reddened eye, the crude wreath of maple-leaves\r\nupon the head, the necklace of finger-bones strung around the neck.\r\n\r\nBut most of all, he knew it by a thing that shocked him more than the\r\nsight of stark, outright cannibalism would have done. A simple thing,\r\nyet how ominous! A thing that argued reason in this reversion from the\r\nhuman; a thing that sent the shuddering chills along the engineer's\r\nspine.\r\n\r\nFor the chief, the obeah-man of this vile drove, rising now from\r\nbeside the fire with a gibbering chatter and a look of bestial malice,\r\nheld between his fangs a twisted brown leaf.\r\n\r\nStern knew at a glance the leaf was the rudely cured product of some\r\ndegenerated tobacco-plant. He saw a glow of red at the tip of the\r\nclose-rolled tobacco. Vapor issued from the chief's slit-mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord--he's--_smoking!_\" stammered the engineer. \"And _that_\r\nmeans--means an almost human brain. And--quick, Beatrice, the water! I\r\ndidn't expect this! Thought they were all alike. Back to the tower,\r\nquick! Here, fill the pail--I'll keep him covered!\"\r\n\r\nUp he brought the automatic, till the bead lay fair upon the naked,\r\nmuscular breast of the obeah.\r\n\r\nBeatrice handed Stern the rifle, then snatching the pail, dipped it,\r\nfilled it to the brim. Stern heard the water lap and gurgle. He knew\r\nit was but a few seconds, yet it seemed an hour to him, at the very\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nKeener than ever before in his whole life, his mental pictures now\r\nlimned themselves with lightning rapidity upon his brain.\r\n\r\nStamped on his consciousness was this lithe, lean, formidable body,\r\nshowing beyond dispute its human ancestry; the right hand that held a\r\n_steel-pointed_ spear; the horrible ornament (a withered little smoked\r\nhand) that dangled from the left wrist by a cord of platted fiber.\r\n\r\nVividly Stern beheld a deep gash or scar that ran from the chief's\r\nright eye--a dull, fishlike eye, evidently destroyed by that\r\nwound--down across the leathery cheek, across the prognathous jaw; a\r\nreddish-purple wale, which on that clay-blue skin produced an effect\r\nindescribably repulsive.\r\n\r\nThen the chief grunted, and moved forward, toward them. Stern saw that\r\nthe gait was almost human, not shuffling and uncertain like that of\r\nthe others, but firm and vigorous. He estimated the height at more\r\nthan five feet, eight inches; the weight at possibly one hundred and\r\nforty pounds. Even at that juncture, his scientific mind, always\r\naccustomed to judging, instinctively registered these data, with the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"Here, you, get back there!\" shouted Stern, as the girl rose again\r\nfrom filling the pail.\r\n\r\nThe cry was instinctive, for even as he uttered it, he knew it could\r\nnot be understood. A thousand years of rapid degeneration had long\r\nwiped all traces of English speech from the brute-men, who now, at\r\nmost, chattered some bestial gibberish. Yet the warning echoed loudly\r\nthrough Madison Forest; and the obeah hesitated.\r\n\r\nThe tone, perhaps, conveyed some meaning to that brain behind the\r\nsloping forehead. Perhaps some dim, racial memory of human speech\r\nstill lingered in that mind, in that strange organism which, by some\r\nfreak of atavism, had \"thrown back\" out of the mire of returning\r\nanimality almost to the human form and stature once again.\r\n\r\nHowever that may have been, the creature-chief halted in his advance.\r\nUndecided he stood a moment, leaning upon his spear, sucking at the\r\nrude mockery of a cigar. Stern remembered having seen Consul, the\r\ntrained chimpanzee, smoke in precisely the same manner, and a nameless\r\nloathing filled him at his mockery of the dead, buried past.\r\n\r\n\"Let me carry the pail!\" said he. \"We've got to hurry--hurry--or it\r\nmay be too late!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no--I'll keep the water!\" she answered, panting. \"You need both\r\nhands clear! Come!\"\r\n\r\nThus they turned, and, with a shuddering glance behind, started back\r\nfor the tower again.\r\n\r\nBut the obeah, with a whining plaint, spat away his tobacco-leaf. They\r\nheard a shuffle of feet. And, looking round again, both saw that he\r\nhad crossed the little brook.\r\n\r\nThere he stood now, his right hand out, palm upward, his lips curled\r\nin the ghastly imitation of a smile, blue gums and yellow lushes\r\nshowing, a sight to freeze the blood with horror. Yet through it all,\r\nthe meaning was most clearly evident.\r\n\r\nBeatrice, laden as she was with the heavy water-bucket, more precious\r\nnow to them than all the wealth of the dead world, would still have\r\nretreated, but with a word of stern command he bade her wait. He\r\nstopped short in his tracks.\r\n\r\n\"Not a step!\" commanded he. \"Hold on! _If_ he makes friends with\r\nus--with gods--that's a million times better every way! Hold on--wait,\r\nno--this is _his_ move.\"\r\n\r\nHe faced the obeah. His left hand gripped the repeating rifle, his\r\nright the automatic, held in readiness for instant action. The muzzle\r\nsight never for a second left its aim at the chief's heart.\r\n\r\nAnd for a second silence fell there in the forest. Save for the\r\nrustling murmur of the Horde, and a faint, woodland trickle of the\r\nstream, you might have thought the place untouched by life.\r\n\r\nYet death lurked there, and destiny--the destiny of the whole world,\r\nthe future, the human race, forever and ever without end; and the\r\ncords of Fate were being loosed for a new knitting.\r\n\r\nAnd Stern, with Beatrice there at his side, stood harsh and strong and\r\nvery grim; stood like an incarnation of man's life, waiting.\r\n\r\nAnd slowly, step by step, over the yielding, noiseless moss, the\r\ngrinning, one-eyed, ghastly obeah-man came nearer, nearer still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHT IN THE FOREST\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the Thing was close, very close to them, while a hush lay\r\nupon the watching Horde and on the forest. So close, that Stern could\r\nhear the soughing breath between those hideous lips and see the\r\ntwitching of the wrinkled lid over the black, glittering eye that\r\nblinked as you have often seen a chimpanzee's.\r\n\r\nAll at once the obeah stopped. Stopped and leered, his head craned\r\nforward, that ghastly rictus on his mouth.\r\n\r\nStern's hot anger welled up again. Thus to be detained, inspected and\r\nseemingly made mock of by a creature no more than three-quarters\r\nhuman, stung the engineer to rage.\r\n\r\n\"What do _you_ want?\" cried he, in a thick and unsteady voice.\r\n\"Anything I can do for you? If not, I'll be going.\"\r\n\r\nThe creature shook its head. Yet something of Stern's meaning may have\r\nwon to its smoldering intelligence. For now it raised a hand. It\r\npointed to the pail of water, then to its own mouth; again it\r\nindicated the pail, then stretched a long, repulsive finger at the\r\nmouth of Stern.\r\n\r\nThe meaning seemed clear. Stern, even as he stood there in anger--and\r\nin wonder, too, at the fearlessness of this superthing--grasped the\r\nsignificance of the action.\r\n\r\n\"Why, he must mean,\" said he, to Beatrice, \"he must be trying to ask\r\nwhether we intend to drink any of the water, what? Maybe it's\r\npoisoned, now, or something! Maybe he's trying to warn us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Warn us? Why should he?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell? It isn't entirely impossible that he still retains\r\nsome knowledge of his human ancestors. Perhaps that tradition may have\r\nbeen handed down, some way, and still exists in the form of a crude\r\nbeast-religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but then--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he wants to get in touch with us, again; learn from us; try\r\nto struggle up out of the mire of degeneration, who knows? If so--and\r\nit's possible--of course he'd try to warn us of a poisoned spring!\"\r\n\r\nActing on this hypothesis, of which he was now half-convinced, Stern\r\nnodded. By gesture-play he answered: Yes. Yes, this woman and he\r\nintended to drink of the water. The obeah-man, grinning, showed signs\r\nof lively interest. His eyes brightened, and a look of craft, of\r\nwizened cunning crept over his uncanny features.\r\n\r\nThen he raised his head and gave a long, shrill, throaty call,\r\nululating and unspeakably weird.\r\n\r\nSomething stirred in the forest. Stern heard a rustle and a creeping\r\nmurmur; and quick fear chilled his heart.\r\n\r\nTo him it seemed as though a voice were calling, perhaps the inner,\r\nsecret voice of his own subjective self--a voice that cried:\r\n\r\n\"You, who must drink water--now _he_ knows you are not gods, but\r\nmortal creatures. Tricked by his question and your answer, your peril\r\nnow is on you! _Flee!_\"\r\n\r\nThe voice died. Stern found himself, with a strange, taut eagerness\r\ntingling all through him, facing the obeah and--and _not daring to\r\nturn his back_.\r\n\r\nRetreat they must, he knew. Retreat, at once! Already in the forest he\r\nunderstood that heads were being lifted, beastlike ears were\r\nlistening, brute eyes peering and ape-hands clutching the little,\r\nflint-pointed spears. Already the girl and he should have been\r\nhalf-way back to the tower; yet still, inhibited by that slow,\r\ngrinning, staring advance of the chief, there the engineer stood.\r\n\r\nBut all at once the spell was broken.\r\n\r\nFor with a cry, a hoarse and frightful yell of passion, the obeah\r\nleaped--leaped like a huge and frightfully agile ape--leaped the whole\r\ndistance intervening.\r\n\r\nStern saw the Thing's red-gleaming eyes fixed on Beatrice. In those\r\neyes he clearly saw the hell-flame of lust. And as the woman screamed\r\nin terror, Stern pulled trigger with a savage curse.\r\n\r\nThe shot went wild. For at the instant--though he felt no pain--his\r\narm dropped down and sideways.\r\n\r\nAstounded, he looked. Something was wrong! What? His trigger-finger\r\nrefused to serve. It had lost all power, all control.\r\n\r\nFor God's sake, what could it be?\r\n\r\nThen--all this taking but a second--Stern saw; he knew the truth.\r\nStaring, pale and horrified, he understood.\r\n\r\nThere, through the fleshy part of his forearm, thrust clean from side\r\nto side by a lightning-swift stroke, he saw the obeah's spear!\r\n\r\nIt dangled strangely in the firm muscles. The steel barb and full\r\neighteen inches of the shaft were red and dripping.\r\n\r\nYet still the engineer felt no slightest twinge of pain.\r\n\r\nFrom his numbed, paralyzed hand the automatic dropped, fell\r\nnoiselessly into the moss.\r\n\r\nAnd with a formless roar of killing-rage, Stern swung on the obeah,\r\nwith the rifle.\r\n\r\nStern felt his heart about to burst with hate. He did not even think\r\nof the second revolver in the holster at his side. With only his left\r\nhand now to use, the weapon could only have given clumsy service.\r\n\r\nInstead, the man reverted instantly to the jungle stage, himself--to\r\nthe law of claw and fang, of clutching talon, of stone and club.\r\n\r\nThe beloved woman's cry, ringing in his ears, drove him mad. Up he\r\nwhirled the Krag again, up, up, by the muzzle; and down upon that\r\nvillainous skull he dashed it with a force that would have brained an\r\nox.\r\n\r\nThe obeah, screeching, reeled back. But he was not dead. Not dead,\r\nonly stunned a moment. And Stern, horrified, found himself holding\r\nonly a gun-barrel. The stock, shattered, had whirled away and vanished\r\namong the tall and waving ferns.\r\n\r\nBeatrice snatched up the fallen revolver. She stumbled; and the pail\r\nwas empty. Spurting, splashing away, the precious water flew. No time,\r\nnow, for any more.\r\n\r\nFor all about them, behind them and on every hand, the Things were\r\nclosing in.\r\n\r\nThey had seen blood--had heard the obeah's cry; they knew! Not gods,\r\nnow, but mortal creatures! _Not gods!_\r\n\r\n\"Run! _Run!_\" gasped Beatrice.\r\n\r\nThe spear still hanging from his arm, Stern wheeled and followed. High\r\nand hard he swung the rifle-barrel, like a war-club.\r\n\r\nNo counting of steps, now; no play at divinity. Panting,\r\nhorror-stricken, frenzied with rage, bleeding, they ran. It was a\r\nhunt--the hunt of the last two humans by the nightmare Horde.\r\n\r\nIn front, a bluish and confused mass seemed to dance and quiver\r\nthrough the forest; and a pattering rain of spears and little arrows\r\nbegan to fall about the fugitives.\r\n\r\nThen the girl's revolver sputtered in a quick volley; and again, for a\r\nspace, silence fell. The way again was clear. But in the path, silent\r\nand still, or writhing horribly, lay a few of the Things. And the\r\npine-needles and soft moss were very red, in spots.\r\n\r\nStern had his pistol out too, by now. For behind and on his flanks,\r\nlike ferrets hanging to a hunted creature, the swarm was closing in.\r\n\r\nThe engineer, his face very white and drawn, veins standing out on his\r\nsweat-beaded forehead, heard Beatrice cry out to him, but he could not\r\nunderstand her words.\r\n\r\nYet as they ran, he saw her level the pistol and snap the hammer\r\ntwice, thrice, with no result. The little dead click sounded like a\r\ndeath-warrant to him.\r\n\r\n\"Empty?\" cried he. \"Here, take this one! You can shoot better now than\r\nI can!\" And into her hand he thrust the second revolver.\r\n\r\nSomething stung him on the left shoulder. He glanced round. A dart was\r\nhanging there.\r\n\r\nWith an oath, the engineer wheeled about. His eyes burned and his lips\r\ndrew back, taut, from his fine white teeth.\r\n\r\nThere, already recovered from the blow which would have killed a man\r\nten times over, he saw the obeah snarling after him. Right down along\r\nthe path the monster was howling, beating his breast with both huge\r\nfists. And, now feeling fear no more than pain, Stern crouched to meet\r\nhis onslaught.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE GOAL, AND THROUGH IT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt all happened in a moment of time, a moment, long--in\r\nseeming--as an hour. The girl's revolver crackled, there behind him.\r\nStern saw a little round bluish hole take shape in the obeah's ear,\r\nand red drops start.\r\n\r\nThen with a ghastly screaming, the Thing was upon him.\r\n\r\nOut struck the engineer, with the rifle-barrel. All the force of his\r\nsplendid muscles lay behind that blow. The Thing tried to dodge. But\r\nStern had been too quick.\r\n\r\nEven as it sprang, with talons clutching for the man's throat, the\r\nsteel barrel drove home on the jaw.\r\n\r\nAn unearthly, piercing yell split the forest air. Then Stern saw the\r\nobeah, his jaw hanging oddly awry, all loose and shattered, fall\r\nheadlong in the path.\r\n\r\nBut before he could strike again, could batter in the base of the\r\ntough skull, a moan from Beatrice sent him to her aid.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, God!\" he cried, and sank beside her on his knees.\r\n\r\nOn her forehead, as she lay gasping among the bushes, he saw an ugly\r\nwelt.\r\n\r\n\"A stone? They've hit her with a stone! Killed her, perhaps?\"\r\n\r\nKneeling there, up he snatched the revolver, and in a deadly fire he\r\npoured out the last spitting shots, pointblank in the faces of the\r\ncrowding rabble.\r\n\r\nUp he leaped. The rifle barrel flashed and glittered as he whirled it.\r\nLike a reaper, laying a clean swath behind him, the engineer mowed\r\ndown a dozen of the beast-men.\r\n\r\nShrieks, grunts, snarls, mingled with his execrations.\r\n\r\nThen fair into a jabbering ape-face he flung the bloodstained barrel.\r\nThe face fell, faded, vanished, as hideous illusions fade in a dream.\r\n\r\nAnd Stern, with a strength he never dreamed was his, caught up the\r\nfainting girl in his left arm, as easily as though she had been a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nStill dragging the spear which pierced his right--his right that yet\r\nprotected her a little--he ran.\r\n\r\nStones, darts, spears, clattered in about him. He heard the swish and\r\ntang of them; heard the leaves flutter as the missiles whirled\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nStruck? Was he struck again?\r\n\r\nHe knew not, nor cared. Only he thought of shielding Beatrice. Nothing\r\nbut that, just that!\r\n\r\n\"The gate--oh, let me reach the gate! God! The gate--\"\r\n\r\nAnd all of a sudden, though how he could not tell, there he seemed to\r\nsee the gate before him. Could it be? Or was that, too, a dream? A\r\ncruel, vicious mockery of his disordered mind?\r\n\r\nYes--the gate! It must be! He recognized the giant pine, in a moment\r\nof lucidity. Then everything began to dance again, to quiver in the\r\nmocking sunlight.\r\n\r\n\"The gate!\" he gasped once more, and staggered on. Behind him, a\r\nlittle trail of blood-drops from his wounded arm fell on the trampled\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nSomething struck his bent head. Through it a blinding pain darted.\r\nThousands of beautiful and tiny lights of every color began to quiver,\r\nto leap and whirl.\r\n\r\n\"They've--set the building on fire!\" thought he; yet all the while he\r\nknew it was impossible, he understood it was only an illusion.\r\n\r\nHe heard the rustle of the wind through the forest. It blent and\r\nmingled with a horrid tumult of grunts, of clicking cries, of gnashing\r\nteeth and little bestial cries.\r\n\r\n\"The--gate!\" sobbed Stern, between hard-set teeth, and stumbled\r\nforward, ever forward, through the Horde.\r\n\r\nTo him, protectingly, he clasped the beautiful body in the tiger-skin.\r\n\r\nLiving? Was she living yet? A great, aching wonder filled him. Could\r\nhe reach the stair with her, and bear her up it? Hurl back these\r\ndevils? Save her, after all?\r\n\r\nThe pain had grown exquisite, in his head. Something seemed hammering\r\nthere, with regular strokes--a red-hot sledge upon an anvil of\r\nwhite-hot steel.\r\n\r\nTo him it looked as though a hundred, a thousand of the little blue\r\nfiends were leaping, shrieking, circling there in front of him. Ten\r\nthousand! And he must break through.\r\n\r\nBreak through!\r\n\r\nWhere had he heard those words? Ah--Yes--\r\n\r\nTo him instantly recurred a distant echo of a song, a Harvard\r\nfootball-song. He remembered. Now he was back again. Yale, 0; Harvard,\r\n17--New Haven, 1898. And see the thousands of cheering spectators! The\r\nhats flying through the air--flags waving--red, most of them!\r\nCrimson--like blood!\r\n\r\nCame the crash and boom of the old Harvard Band, with big Joe Foley\r\nbanging the drum till it was fit to burst, with Marsh blowing his\r\nlungs out on the cornet, and all the other fellows raising Cain.\r\n\r\nUproar! Cheering! And again the music. Everybody was singing now,\r\neverybody roaring out that brave old fighting chorus:\r\n\r\n  \".....Now--all to-geth-er,\r\n   Smash them--_and_--break--_through!_\"\r\n\r\nAnd see! Look there! The goal!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scene shifted, all at once, in a quite\r\nunaccountable and puzzling manner.\r\n\r\nSomehow, victory wasn't quite won, after all. Not quite yet. What was\r\nthe matter, then? What was wrong? Where _was_ he?\r\n\r\nAh, the Goal!\r\n\r\nYes, there through the rack and mass of the Blues, he saw it, again,\r\nquite clearly. He was sure of _that_, anyhow.\r\n\r\nThe goal-posts seemed a trifle near together, and they were certainly\r\nmade of crumbling stone, instead of straight wooden beams. Odd, that!\r\n\r\nHe wondered, too, why the management allowed trees to grow on the\r\nfield, trees and bushes--why a huge pine should be standing right\r\nthere by the left-hand post. That was certainly a matter to be\r\ninvestigated and complained of, later. But now was no time for kicks.\r\n\r\n\"Probably some Blue trick,\" thought Stern. \"No matter, it won't do 'em\r\nany good, this time!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAh! An opening! Stern's head went lower still.\r\nHe braced himself for a leap.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, come on!\" he yelled defiance.\r\n\r\nAgain he heard the cheering, once wind like a chorus of mad devils.\r\n\r\nAn opening? No, he was mistaken. Instead, the Blues were massing there\r\nby the Goal.\r\n\r\nBitterly he swore. Under his arm he tightened the ball. He ran!\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nThey were trying to tackle?\r\n\r\n\"Damn you!\" he cried, in boiling anger. \"I'll--I'll show you a trick\r\nor two--yet!\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, circled, dodged the clutching hands, feinted with a tactic\r\nlong unthought of, and broke into a straight, resistless dash for the\r\nposts.\r\n\r\nAs he ran, he yelled:\r\n\r\n\"_Smash_ them--and--break _through!_ . .....\"\r\n\r\nAll his waning strength upgathered for that run. Yet how strangely\r\ntired he felt--how heavy the ball was growing!\r\n\r\nWhat was the matter with his head? With his right arm? They both ached\r\nhideously. He must have got hurt, some way, in one of the \"downs.\"\r\nSome dirty work, somewhere. Rotten sport!\r\n\r\nHe ran. Never in all his many games had he seen such peculiar\r\ngridiron, all tangled and overgrown. Never, such host of tackles.\r\nHundreds of them! Where were the Crimsons? What? No support, no\r\ninterference? Hell!\r\n\r\nYet the Goal was surely just there, now right ahead. He ran.\r\n\r\n\"Foul!\" he shouted savagely, as a Blue struck at him, then another and\r\nanother, and many more. The taste of blood came to his tongue. He\r\nspat. \"Foul!\"\r\n\r\nRight and left he dashed them, with a giant's strength. They scattered\r\nin panic, with strange and unintelligible cries.\r\n\r\n\"The goal!\"\r\n\r\nHe reached it. And, as he crossed the line, he fell.\r\n\r\n\"_Down_, down!\" sobbed he.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nBEATRICE DARES\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour later, Stern and Beatrice sat weak and shaken in their\r\nstronghold on the fifth floor, resting, trying to gather up some\r\nstrength again, to pull together for resistance to the siege that had\r\nset in.\r\n\r\nWith the return of reason to the engineer--his free bleeding had\r\nsomewhat checked the onset of fever--and of consciousness to the girl,\r\nthey began to piece out, bit by bit, the stages of their retreat.\r\n\r\nNow that Stern had barricaded the stairs, two stories below, and that\r\nfor a little while they felt reasonably safe, they were able to take\r\ntheir bearings, to recall the flight, to plan a bit for the future, a\r\nfuture dark with menace, seemingly hopeless in its outlook.\r\n\r\n\"If it--hadn't been for you,\" Beatrice was saying, \"if you hadn't\r\npicked me up and carried me, when that stone struck, I--I--\"\r\n\r\n\"How's the ache now?\" Stern hastily interrupted, in a rather weak yet\r\nbrisk voice, which he was trying hard to render matter-of-fact. \"Of\r\ncourse the lack of water, except that half-pint or so, to bathe your\r\nbruise with, is a rank barbarity. But if we haven't got any, we\r\nhaven't--that's all. All--till we have another go at 'em!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Allan!\" she exclaimed, tremulously. \"Don't think of _me!_ Of me,\r\nwhen your back's gashed with a spear-cut, your head's battered, arm\r\npierced, and we've neither water nor bandages--nothing of any kind to\r\ntreat your wounds with!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come now, don't you bother about me!\" he objected trying hard to\r\nsmile, though racked with pain. \"I'll be O. K., fit as a fiddle, in no\r\ntime. Perfect health and all that sort of thing, you know. It'll heal\r\nright away.\r\n\r\n\"Head's clear again already, in spite of that whack with the war-club,\r\nor whatever it was they landed with. But for a while I certainly was\r\nseeing things. I had 'em--had 'em bad! Thought--well, strange things.\r\n\r\n\"My back? Only a scratch, that's all. It's begun to coagulate already,\r\nthe blood has, hasn't it?\" And he strove to peer over his own shoulder\r\nat the slash. But the pain made him desist. He could hardly keep back\r\na groan. His face twitched involuntarily.\r\n\r\nThe girl sank on her knees beside him. Her arm encircled him; her hand\r\nsmoothed his forehead; and with a strange look she studied his\r\nunnaturally pale face.\r\n\r\n\"It's your arm I'm thinking about, more than anything,\" said she.\r\n\"We've _got_ to have something to treat that with. Tell me, does it\r\nhurt you very much, Allan?\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to laugh, as he glanced down at the wounded arm, which,\r\nligatured about the spear-thrust with a thong, and supported by a\r\nrawhide sling, looked strangely blue and swollen.\r\n\r\n\"Hurt me? Nonsense! I'll be fine and dandy in no time. The only\r\ntrouble is, I'm not much good as a fighter this way. Southpaw, you\r\nsee. Can't shoot worth a--a cent, you know, with my left. Otherwise, I\r\nwouldn't mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoot? Trust _me_ for that now!\" she exclaimed. \"We've still got two\r\nrevolvers and the shotgun left, and lots of ammunition. I'll do the\r\nshooting--if there's got to be any done!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're all right, Beatrice!\" exclaimed the wounded man fervently.\r\n\"What would I do without you? And to think how near you came to--but\r\nnever mind. That's over now; forget it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but what next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know. Get well, maybe. Things might be worse. I might have a\r\nbroken arm, or something; laid up for weeks--slow starvation and all\r\nthat. What's a mere puncture? Nothing! Now that the spear's out, it'll\r\nbegin healing right away.\r\n\r\n\"Bet a million, though, that What's-His-Name down there, Big Chief the\r\nMonk, won't get out of _his_ scrape in a hurry. His face is certainly\r\nscrambled, or I miss my guess. You got him through the ear with one\r\nshot, by the way. Know that? Fact! Drilled it clean! Just a little to\r\nthe right and you'd have _had_ him for keeps. But never mind, we'll\r\nsave him for the encore--if there is any.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think they'll try again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't say. They've lost a lot of fighters, killed and wounded,\r\nalready. And they've had a pretty liberal taste of our style. That\r\nought to hold them for a while! We'll see, at any rate. And if luck\r\nstays good, we'll maybe have a thing or two to show them if they keep\r\non hanging round where they aren't wanted!\"\r\n\r\nCame now a little silence. Beside Stern the girl sat, half supporting\r\nhis wounded body with her firm, white arm. Thirst was beginning to\r\ntorment them both, particularly Stern, whose injuries had already\r\ngiven him a marked temperature. But water there was absolutely none.\r\nAnd so, still planless, glad only to recuperate a little, content that\r\nfor the present the Horde had been held back, they waited. Waiting,\r\nthey both thought. The girl's thoughts were all of him; but he,\r\nman-fashion, was trying to piece out what had happened, to frame some\r\ncoherent idea of it all, to analyze the urgent necessities that lay\r\nupon them both.\r\n\r\nHere and there, a disjointed bit recurred to him, even from out of the\r\ndelirium that had followed the blow on the head. From the time he had\r\nrecovered his senses in the building, things were clearer.\r\n\r\nHe knew that the Horde, temporarily frightened by his mad rush, had\r\ngiven him time to stumble up again and once more lift the girl, before\r\nthey had ventured to creep into the arcade in search of their prey.\r\n\r\nHe remembered that the spear had been gone then. Raving, he must have\r\nbroken and plucked it out. The blood, he recalled, was spurting freely\r\nas he had carried Beatrice through the wreckage and up to the first\r\nlanding, where she had regained partial consciousness.\r\n\r\nThen he shuddered at recollection of that stealthy, apelike creeping\r\nof the Horde scouts in among the ruins, furtive and silent; their\r\nsniffing after the blood-track; their frightful agility in clambering\r\nwith feet and hands alike, swinging themselves up like chimpanzees,\r\nswarming aloft on the death-hunt.\r\n\r\nHe had evaded them, from story to story. Beatrice, able now to walk,\r\nhad helped him roll down balustrades and building-stones, fling rocks,\r\nwrench stairs loose and block the way.\r\n\r\nAnd so, wounding their pursuers, yet tracked always by more and ever\r\nmore, they had come to the landing, where by aid of the rifle barrel\r\nas a lever they had been able to bring a whole wall crashing down, to\r\nchoke the passage. That had brought silence. For a time, at least,\r\npursuit had been abandoned. In the sliding, dusty avalanche of the\r\nwall, hurled down the stairway, Stern knew by the grunts and shrieks\r\nwhich had arisen that some of the Horde had surely perished--how many,\r\nhe could not tell. A score or two at the very least, he ardently\r\nhoped.\r\n\r\nFear, at any rate, had been temporarily injected into the rest. For\r\nthe attack had not yet been renewed. Outside in the forest, no sign of\r\nthe Horde, no sound. A disconcerting, ominous calm had settled like a\r\npall. Even the birds, recovered from their terrors, had begun to hop\r\nabout and take up their twittering little household tasks.\r\n\r\nAs in a kind of clairvoyance, the engineer seemed to know there would\r\nbe respite until night. For a little while, at least, there could be\r\nrest and peace. But when darkness should have settled down--\r\n\r\n\"If they'd only show themselves!\" thought he, his leaden eyes closing\r\nin an overmastering lassitude, a vast swooning weakness of blood-loss\r\nand exhaustion. Not even his parched thirst, a veritable torture now,\r\ncould keep his thoughts from wandering. \"If they'd tackle again, I\r\ncould score with--with lead--what's _that_ I'm thinking? I'm not\r\ndelirious, am I?\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment he brought himself back with a start, back to a full\r\nrealization of the place. But again the drowsiness gained on him.\r\n\r\n\"We've got guns now; guns and ammunition,\" thought he. \"We--could pick\r\nthem off--from the windows. Pick them--off--pick--them--off--\"\r\n\r\nHe slept. Thus, often, wounded soldiers sleep, with troubled dreams,\r\non the verge of renewed battle which may mean their death, their long\r\nand wakeless slumber.\r\n\r\nHe slept. And the girl, laying his gashed head gently back upon the\r\npile of furs, bent over him with infinite compassion. For a long\r\nminute, hardly breathing, she watched him there. More quickly came her\r\nbreath. A strange new light shone in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Only for me, those wounds!\" she whispered slowly. \"Only for me!\"\r\n\r\nTaking his head in both her hands, she kissed him as he lay\r\nunconscious. Kissed him twice, and then a third time.\r\n\r\nThen she arose.\r\n\r\nQuickly, as though with some definite plan, she chose from among their\r\nstore of utensils a large copper kettle, one which he had brought her\r\nthe week before from the little Broadway shop.\r\n\r\nShe took a long rawhide rope, braided by Stern during their long\r\nevenings together. This she knotted firmly to the bale of the kettle.\r\n\r\nThe revolvers, fully reloaded, she examined with care. One of them she\r\nlaid beside the sleeper. The other she slid into her full, warm bosom,\r\nwhere the clinging tiger-skin held it ready for her hand.\r\n\r\nThen she walked noiselessly to the door leading into the hallway.\r\n\r\nHere for a moment she stood, looking back at the wounded man. Tears\r\ndimmed her eyes, yet they were very glad.\r\n\r\n\"For your sake, now, everything!\" she said. \"Everything--all! Oh,\r\nAllan, if you only knew! And now--good-by!\"\r\n\r\nThen she was gone.\r\n\r\nAnd in the silent room, their home, which out of wreck and chaos they\r\nhad made, the fevered man lay very still, his pulses throbbing in his\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nOutside, very far, very faint in the forests, a muffled drum began to\r\nbeat again.\r\n\r\nAnd the slow shadows, lengthening across the floor, told that evening\r\nwas drawing nigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTO WORK!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe engineer awoke with a start--awoke to find daylight gone,\r\nto find that dusk had settled, had shrouded the whole place in gloom.\r\n\r\nConfused, he started up. He was about to call out, when prudence muted\r\nhis voice. For the moment he could not recollect just what had\r\nhappened or where he was; but a vast impending consciousness of evil\r\nand of danger weighed upon him. It warned him to keep still, to make\r\nno outcry. A burning thirst quickened his memory.\r\n\r\nThen his comprehension returned. Still weak and shaken, yet greatly\r\nbenefited by his sleep, he took a few steps toward the door. Where was\r\nthe girl? Was he alone? What could all this mean?\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! Oh, Beatrice!\" he called thickly, in guarded tones. \"Where\r\nare you? Answer me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here--coming!\" he heard her voice. And then he saw her, dimly, in the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n\"What is it? Where have you been? How long have I been asleep?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer his questions, but came quickly to him, took his\r\nhand, and with her own smoothed his brow.\r\n\r\n\"Better, now?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"Lots! I'll be all right in a little while. It's nothing. But what\r\nhave _you_ been doing all this time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, and I'll show you.\" She led him toward the other room.\r\n\r\nHe followed, in growing wonder.\r\n\r\n\"No attack, yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"None. But the drums have been beating for a long time now. Hear\r\n_that?_\"\r\n\r\nThey listened. To them drifted a dull, monotonous sound, harbinger of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nStern laughed bitterly, chokingly, by reason of his thirst.\r\n\r\n\"Much good their orchestra will do them,\" said he, \"when it comes to\r\nfacing soft-nosed .38's! But tell me, what was it you were going to\r\nshow me?\"\r\n\r\nQuickly she went over to their crude table, took up a dish and came\r\nback to him.\r\n\r\n\"Drink this!\" bade she.\r\n\r\nHe took it, wondering.\r\n\r\n\"What? _Coffee?_ But--\"\r\n\r\n\"Drink! I've had mine, already. Drink!\"\r\n\r\nHalf-stupefied, he obeyed. He drained the whole dish at a draft, then\r\ncaught his breath in a long sigh.\r\n\r\n\"But this means water!\" cried he, with renewed vigor. \"And--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" she directed, pointing. There on the circular hearth\r\nstood the copper kettle, three-quarters full.\r\n\r\n\"Water! You've got _water?_\" He started forward in amazement. \"While\r\nI've been sleeping? Where--?\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed with real enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing,\" she disclaimed. \"After what you've done for me, this\r\nis the merest trifle, Allan. You know that big cavity made by the\r\nboiler-explosion? Yes? Well, when we looked down into it, before we\r\nventured out to the spring, I noticed a good deal of water at the\r\nbottom, stagnant water, that had run out of the boiler and settled on\r\nthe hard clay floor and in among the cracked cement. I just merely\r\nbrought up some, and strained and boiled it, that's all. So you see--\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my Lord!\" burst out the man, \"d'you mean to say you--you went\r\ndown _there--alone?_\"\r\n\r\nOnce more the girl laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Not alone,\" she answered. \"One of the automatics was kind enough to\r\nbear me company. Of course the main stairway was impassable. But I\r\nfound another way, off through the east end of the building and down\r\nsome stairs we haven't used at all, yet. They may be useful, by the\r\nway, in case of--well--a retreat. Once I'd reached the arcade, the\r\nrest was easy. I had that leather rope tied to the kettle handle, you\r\nsee. So all I had to do was--\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Horde! The Horde?\"\r\n\r\n\"None of them down there, now--that is, alive. None when I was there.\r\nAll at the war-council, I imagine. I just happened to strike it right,\r\nyou see. It wasn't anything. We simply _had_ to have water, so I went\r\nand got some, that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all?\" echoed Stern, in a trembling voice. \"That's--_all!_\"\r\n\r\nThen, lest she see his face even by the dim light through the window,\r\nhe turned aside a minute. For the tears in his eyes, he felt, were a\r\nweakness which he would not care to reveal.\r\n\r\nBut presently he faced the girl again.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice,\" said he, \"words fall so flat, so hopelessly dead; they're\r\nso inadequate, so anticlimactic at a time like this, that I'm just\r\ngoing to skip them all. It's no use thanking you, or analyzing this\r\nthing, or saying any of the commonplace, stupid things. Let it pass.\r\nYou've got water, that's enough. You've made good, where I failed.\r\nWell--\"\r\n\r\nHis voice broke again, and he grew silent. But she, peering at him\r\nwith wonder, laid a hand upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said she, \"you must eat something, too. I've got a little\r\nsupper ready. After that, the Pulverite?\"\r\n\r\nHe started as though shot.\r\n\r\n\"That's so! I _can_ make it now!\" cried he, new life and energy\r\nsuffusing him. \"Even with my one hand, if you help me, I can make it!\r\nSupper? No, no! To _work!_\"\r\n\r\nBut she insisted, womanlike; and he at last consented to a bite. When\r\nthis was over, they began preparations for the manufacture of the\r\nterrible explosive, Stern's own secret and invention, which, had not\r\nthe cataclysm intervened, would have made him ten times over a\r\nmillionaire. More precious now to him, that knowledge, than all the\r\ngolden treasures of the dead, forsaken world!\r\n\r\n\"We've got to risk a light,\" said he. \"If it's turned low, and shaded,\r\nmaybe they won't learn our whereabouts. But however that may be, we\r\ncan't work in the dark. It would be too horribly perilous. One false\r\nmove, one wrong combination, even the addition of one ingredient at\r\nthe improper moment, and--well--you understand.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said she. \"And we don't want to quit--just _yet!_\"\r\n\r\nSo they lighted the smaller of their copper lamps, and set to work in\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\nOn the table, cleared of dishes and of food, Stern placed in order\r\neight glass bottles, containing the eight basic chemicals for his\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nBeside him, at his left hand, he set a large metal dish with three\r\nquarts of water, still warm. In front of him stood his copper\r\ntea-kettle--the strangest retort, surely in which the terrific\r\ncompound ever had been distilled.\r\n\r\n\"Now our chairs, and the lamp,\" said he, \"and we're ready to begin.\r\nBut first,\" and, looking earnestly at her, \"first, tell me frankly,\r\nwouldn't you just a little rather have me carry out this experiment\r\nalone? You could wait elsewhere, you know. With these uncertain\r\nmaterials and all the crude conditions we've got to work under,\r\nthere's no telling what--might happen.\r\n\r\n\"I've never yet found a man who would willingly stand by and see me\r\nbuild Pulverite, much less a woman. It's frightful, this stuff is!\r\nDon't be ashamed to tell me; are you afraid?\"\r\n\r\nFor a long moment the girl looked at him.\r\n\r\n\"Afraid--with _you?_\" said she.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE PULVERITE\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour passed. And now, under the circle of light cast by the\r\nhooded lamp upon the table, there in that bare, wrecked office-home of\r\ntheirs, the Pulverite was coming to its birth.\r\n\r\nAlready at the bottom of the metal dish lay a thin yellow cloud,\r\nsomething that looked like London fog on a December morning. There,\r\ncovered with the water, it gently swirled and curdled, with strange\r\nmetallic glints and oily sheens, as Beatrice with a gold spoon stirred\r\nit at the engineer's command.\r\n\r\nFrom moment to moment he dropped in a minute quantity of glycerin, out\r\nof a glass test-tube, graduated to the hundredth of an ounce. Keenly,\r\nunder the lamp-shine, he watched the final reaction; his face, very\r\npale and set, reflected a little of the mental stress that bound him.\r\n\r\nAlong the table-edge before him, limp in its sling, his wounded arm\r\nlay useless. Yet with his left hand he controlled the sleeping giant\r\nin the dish. And as he dropped the glycerin, he counted.\r\n\r\n\"Ten, eleven, twelve--fifteen, sixteen--twenty! Now! Now pour the\r\nwater off, quick! _Quick!_\"\r\n\r\nSplendidly the girl obeyed. The water ran, foaming strangely, out into\r\na glass jar set to receive it. Her hands trembled not, nor did she\r\nhesitate. Only, a line formed between her brows; and her breath,\r\nhalf-held, came quickly through her lips.\r\n\r\n\"_Stop!_\"\r\n\r\nHis voice rang like a shot.\r\n\r\n\"Now, decant it through this funnel, into the vials!\"\r\n\r\nAgain, using both hands for steadiness, she did his bidding.\r\n\r\nAnd one by one as she filled the little flasks of chained death, the\r\nengineer stoppered them with his left hand.\r\n\r\nWhen the last was done, Stern drew a tremendous sigh, and dashed the\r\nsweat from his forehead with a gesture of victory.\r\n\r\nInto the residue in the dish he poured a little nitric acid.\r\n\r\n\"_That's_ got no kick left in it, now, anyhow,\" said he relieved. \"The\r\nHNO3 tames it, quick enough. But the bottles--take care--don't tip one\r\nover, as you love your life!\"\r\n\r\nHe stood up, slowly, and for a moment remained there, his face in the\r\nshadow of the lamp-shade, holding to the table-edge for support, with\r\nhis left hand.\r\n\r\nAt him the girl looked.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" she began, \"now--?\"\r\n\r\nThe question had no time for completion. For even as she spoke, a\r\nswift little something flicked through the window, behind them.\r\n\r\nIt struck the opposite wall with a sharp _crack!_ then fell slithering\r\nto the floor.\r\n\r\nOutside, against the building, they heard another and another little\r\nshock; and all at once a second missile darted through the air.\r\n\r\nThis hit the lamp. Stern grabbed the shade and steadied it. Beatrice\r\nstooped and snatched up the thing from where it lay beside the table.\r\n\r\nOnly one glance Stern gave at it, as she held it up. A long reed stem\r\nhe saw wrapped at its base with cotton fibers--a fish-bone point,\r\nfirm-lashed--and on that point a dull red stain, a blotch of something\r\ndry and shiny.\r\n\r\n\"Blow-gun darts!\" cried he. \"Poisoned! They've seen the light--got our\r\nrange! They're up there in the tree-tops--shooting at us!\"\r\n\r\nWith one puff, the light was gone. By the wrist he seized Beatrice. He\r\ndragged her toward the front wall, off to one side, out of range.\r\n\r\n\"The flasks of Pulverite! Suppose a dart should hit one?\" exclaimed\r\nthe girl.\r\n\r\n\"That's so! Wait here--I'll get them!\"\r\n\r\nBut she was there beside him as, in the thick dark, he cautiously felt\r\nfor the deadly things and found them with a hand that _dared not_\r\ntremble. And though here, there, the little venom-stings whis-s-shed\r\nover them and past them, to shatter on the rear wall, she helped him\r\nbear the vials, all nine of them, to a place of safety in the\r\nleft-hand front corner where by no possibility could they be struck.\r\n\r\nTogether then, quietly as wraiths, they stole into the next room; and\r\nthere, from a window not as yet attacked, they spied out at the dark\r\ntree-tops that lay in dense masses almost brushing the walls.\r\n\r\n\"See? See there?\" whispered Stern in the girl's ear. He pointed where,\r\nnot ten yards away and below, a blacker shadow seemed to move along a\r\nhemlock branch. Forgotten now, his wounds. Forgotten his loss of\r\nblood, his fever and his weakness. The sight of that creeping stealthy\r\nattack nerved him with new vigor. And, even as the girl looked, Stern\r\ndrew his revolver.\r\n\r\nSpeaking no further word, he laid the ugly barrel firm across the\r\nsill.\r\n\r\nCarefully he sighted, as best he could in that gloom lit only by the\r\nstars. Coldly as though at a target-shot, he brought the muzzle-sight\r\nto bear on that deep, crawling shadow.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly a spurt of fire split the night. The crackling report\r\nechoed away. And with a bubbling scream, the shadow loosened from the\r\nlimb, as a ripe fruit loosens.\r\n\r\nVaguely they saw it fall, whirl, strike a branch, slide off, and\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nAll at once a pattering rain of darts flickered around them. Stern\r\nfelt one strike his fur jacket and bounce off. Another grazed the\r\ngirl's head. But to their work they stood, and flinched not.\r\n\r\nNow her revolver was speaking, in antiphony with his; and from the\r\nbranches, two, three, five, eight, ten of the ape-things fell.\r\n\r\n\"Give it to 'em!\" shouted the engineer, as though he had a regiment\r\nbehind him. \"_Give_ it to 'em!\" And again he pulled the trigger.\r\n\r\nThe revolver was empty.\r\n\r\nWith a cry he threw it down, and, running to where the shotgun stood,\r\nsnatched it up. He scooped into his pocket a handful of shells from\r\nthe box where they were stored; and as he darted back to the window,\r\nhe cocked both hammers.\r\n\r\n\"Poom! _Poom!_\"\r\n\r\nThe deep baying of the revolver roared out in twin jets of flame.\r\n\r\nStern broke the gun and jacked in two more shells.\r\n\r\nAgain he fired.\r\n\r\n\"Good Heaven! How many of 'em _are_ there in the trees?\" shouted he.\r\n\r\n\"Try the Pulverite!\" cried Beatrice. \"Maybe you might hit a branch!\"\r\n\r\nStern flung down the gun. To the corner where the vials were standing\r\nhe ran.\r\n\r\nUp he caught one--he dared not take two lest they should by some\r\naccident strike together.\r\n\r\n\"Here--here, now, take _this!_\" he bellowed.\r\n\r\nAnd from the window, aiming at a pine that stood seventy-five feet\r\naway--a pine whose branches seemed to hang thick with the Horde's\r\nblowgun-men--he slung it with all the strength of his uninjured arm.\r\n\r\nInto the gloom it vanished, the little meteorite of latent death, of\r\npotential horror and destruction.\r\n\r\n\"If it hits 'em, they'll think we _are_ gods, after all, what?\" cried\r\nthe engineer, peering eagerly. But for a moment, nothing happened.\r\n\r\n\"Missed it!\" he groaned. \"If I only had my right arm to use now, I\r\nmight--\"\r\n\r\nFar below, down there a hundred feet beneath them and out a long way\r\nfrom the tower base, night yawned wide in a burst of hellish glare.\r\n\r\nA vast conical hole of flame was gouged in the dark. For a fraction of\r\na second every tree, limb, twig stood out in vivid detail, as that\r\nblue-white glory shot aloft.\r\n\r\nAll up through the forest the girl and Stern got a momentary glimpse\r\nof little, clinging Things, crouching misshapen, hideous.\r\n\r\nThen, as a riven and distorted whirl burst upward in a huge geyser of\r\nannihilation, came a detonation that ripped, stunned, shattered; that\r\nsent both the defenders staggering backward from the window.\r\n\r\nDarkness closed again, like a gaping mouth that shuts. And all about\r\nthe building, through the trees, and down again in a titanic, slashing\r\nrain fell the wreckage of things that had been stone, and earth, and\r\nroot, and tree, and living creatures--that had been--that now were but\r\none indistinguishable mass of ruin and of death.\r\n\r\nAfter that, here and there, small dark objects came dropping,\r\nthudding, crashing down. You might have thought some cosmic gardener\r\nhad shaken his orchard, his orchard where the plums and pears were\r\nrotten-ripe.\r\n\r\n\"_One!_\" cried the engineer, in a strange, wild, exultant voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE ON THE STAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost like the echo of his shout, a faint snarling cry rose\r\nfrom the corridor, outside. They heard a clicking, sliding, ominous\r\nsound; and, with instant comprehension, knew the truth.\r\n\r\n\"They've got up, some of them--somehow!\" Stern cried. \"They'll be at\r\nour throats, here, in a moment! Load! _Load!_ You shoot--_I'll_ give\r\n'em Pulverite!\"\r\n\r\nNo time, now, for caution. While the girl hastily threw in more\r\ncartridges, Stern gathered up all the remaining vials of the\r\nexplosive.\r\n\r\nThese, garnered along his wounded arm which clasped them to his body,\r\nmade a little bristling row of death. His left hand remained free, to\r\nfling the little glass bombs.\r\n\r\n\"Come! Come, meet 'em--they mustn't trap us, here!\"\r\n\r\nAnd together they crept noiselessly into the other room and thence to\r\nthe corridor-door.\r\n\r\nOut they peered.\r\n\r\n\"Look! Torches!\" whispered he.\r\n\r\nThere at the far end of the hallway, a red glare already flickered on\r\nthe wall around the turn by the elevator-shaft. Already the confused\r\nsounds of the attackers were drawing near.\r\n\r\n\"They've managed to dig away the barricade, somehow,\" said Stern. \"And\r\nnow they're out for business--clubs, poisoned darts and all--and\r\nfangs, and claws! How many of 'em? God knows! A swarm, that's all!\"\r\n\r\nHis mouth felt hot and dry, with fever, and the mad excitement of the\r\nimpending battle. His skin seemed tense and drawn, especially upon the\r\nforehead. As he stood there, waiting, he heard the girl's quick\r\nbreathing. Though he could hardly see her in the gloom, he felt her\r\npresence and he loved it.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice,\" said he, and for a moment his hand sought hers, \"Beatrice,\r\nlittle girl o' mine, if this is the big finish, if we both go down\r\ntogether and there's no to-morrow, I want to tell you now--\"\r\n\r\nA yapping outcry interrupted him. The girl seized his arm. Brighter\r\nthe torchlight grew.\r\n\r\n\"Allan!\" she whispered. \"Come back, back, away from here. We've got to\r\nget up those stairs, there, at the other end of the hall. _This_ is no\r\nkind of place to meet them--we're exposed, here. There's no\r\nprotection!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right.\" he answered. \"Come!\"\r\n\r\nLike ghosts they slid away, noiselessly, through the enshrouding\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nEven as they gained the shelter of the winding stairway, the scouts of\r\nthe Horde, flaring their torches into each room they passed, came into\r\nview around the corner at the distant end.\r\n\r\nShuffling, hideous beyond all words by the fire-gleam, bent, wizened,\r\nblue, the Things swarmed toward them in a vague and shifting mass, a\r\nruck of horror.\r\n\r\nThe defenders, peering from behind the broken balustrade, could hear\r\nthe guttural jabber of their beast-talk, the clicking play of their\r\nfangs; could see the craning necks, the talons that held spears,\r\nbludgeons, blow-guns, even jagged rocks.\r\n\r\nOver all, the smoky gleams wavered in a ghastly interplay of light and\r\ndarkness. Uncanny shadows leaped along the walls. From every corner\r\nand recess and black, empty door, ghoulish shapes seemed creeping.\r\n\r\nTense, now, the moment hung.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the engineer bent forward, staring.\r\n\r\n\"The chief!\" he whispered. And as he spoke, Beatrice aimed.\r\n\r\nThere, shambling among the drove of things, they saw him clearly for a\r\nmoment: Uglier, more incredibly brutal than ever he looked, now, by\r\nthat uncanny light.\r\n\r\nStern saw--and rejoiced in the sight--that the obeah's jaw hung surely\r\nbroken, all awry. The quick-blinking, narrow-ridded eyes shuttled\r\nhere, there, as the creature sought to spy out his enemies. The\r\nnostrils dilated, to catch the spoor of man. Man, no longer god, but\r\nmortal.\r\n\r\nOne hand held a crackling pine-knot. The other gripped the heft of a\r\nstone ax, one blow of which would dash to pulp the stoutest skull.\r\n\r\nThis much Stern noted, as in a flash; when at his side the girl's\r\nrevolver spat.\r\n\r\nThe report roared heavily in that constricted space. For a moment the\r\nobeah stopped short. A look of brute pain, of wonder, then of\r\nquintupled rage passed over his face. A twitching grin of passion\r\ndistorted the huge, wounded gash of the mouth. He screamed. Up came\r\nthe stone ax.\r\n\r\n\"Again!\" shouted Stern. \"Give it to him again!\"\r\n\r\nShe fired on the instant. But already, with a chattering howl, the\r\nobeah was running forward. And after him, screaming, snarling, foaming\r\ntill their lips were all a slaver, the pack swept toward them.\r\n\r\nStern dragged the girl away, back to the landing.\r\n\r\n\"Up! _Up!_\" he yelled.\r\n\r\nThen, turning, he hurled the second bomb.\r\n\r\nA blinding glare dazzled him. A shock, as of a suddenly unleashed\r\nvolcano, all but flung him headlong.\r\n\r\nDazed, choked by the gush of fumes that burst in a billowing cloud out\r\nalong the hall and up the stairs, he staggered forward. Tightly to his\r\nbody he clutched the remaining vials. Where was Beatrice? He knew not.\r\nEverything boomed and echoed in his stunned ears. Below there, he\r\nheard thunderous crashes as wrecked walls and floors went reeling\r\ndown. And ever, all about him, eddied the strangling smoke.\r\n\r\nThen, how long after he knew not, he found himself gasping for air\r\nbeside a window.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice!\" he shouted with his first breath. Everything seemed\r\nstrangely still. No sound of pursuit, no howling now. Dead calm. Not\r\neven the drum-beat in the forest, far below.\r\n\r\n\"_Beatrice!_ Where are you? _Beatrice!_\"\r\n\r\nHis heart leaped gladly as he heard her answer.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Are you safe? Thank God! I--I was afraid--I didn't know--\"\r\n\r\nTo him she ran along the dark passageway.\r\n\r\n\"No more!\" she panted. \"No more Pulverite here in the building!\"\r\npleaded she. \"Or the whole tower will fall--and bury us! No more!\"\r\n\r\nStern laughed. Beatrice was unharmed; he had found her.\r\n\r\n\"I'll sow it broadcast outside,\" he answered, in a kind of exaltation,\r\nalmost a madness from the strain and horror of that night, the\r\nweakness of his fever and his loss of blood. \"Maybe the others, down\r\nthere still, may need it. Here goes!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, one by one, all seven of the bombs he hurled far out and away, to\r\nright, to left, straight ahead, slinging them in vast parabolas from\r\nthe height.\r\n\r\nAnd as they struck one by one, night blazed like noonday; and even to\r\nthe Palisades the crashing echoes roared.\r\n\r\nThe forest, swept as by a giant broom, became a jackstraw tangle of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThus it perished.\r\n\r\nWhen the last vial of wrath had been out-poured, when silence had once\r\nmore dropped its soothing mantle and the great brooding dark had come\r\nagain, \"girdled with gracious watchings of the stars,\" Stern spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Gods!\" he exclaimed exultantly. \"Gods we are now to them--to such of\r\nthem as may still live. Gods we are--gods we shall be forever!\r\n\r\n\"Whatever happens now, _they_ know us. The Great White Gods of Terror!\r\nThey'll flee before our very look! Unarmed, if we meet a thousand,\r\nwe'll be safe. _Gods!_\"\r\n\r\nAnother silence.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he knew that Beatrice was weeping.\r\n\r\nAnd forgetful of all save that, forgetful of his weakness and his\r\nwounds, he comforted her--as only a man can comfort the woman he\r\nloves, the woman who, in turn, loves him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nCONSUMMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a while, both calmer grown, they looked again from the\r\nhigh window.\r\n\r\n\"See!\" exclaimed the engineer, and pointed.\r\n\r\nThere, far away to westward, a few straggling lights--only a very\r\nfew--slowly and uncertainly were making their way across the broad\r\nblack breast of the river.\r\n\r\nEven as the man and woman watched, one vanished. Then another winked\r\nout, and did not reappear. No more than fifteen seemed to reach the\r\nJersey shore, there to creep vaguely, slowly away and vanish in the\r\ndense primeval woods.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said Stern at last. \"We must be going, too. The night's half\r\nspent. By morning we must be very far away.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? We've got to leave the city?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. There's no such thing as staying here now. The tower's quite\r\nuntenable. Racked and shaken as it is, it's liable to fall at any\r\ntime. But, even if it should stand, we can't live here any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--where now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't just know. Somewhere else, that's certain. Everything in this\r\nwhole vicinity is ruined. The spring's gone. Nothing remains of the\r\nforest, nothing but horror and death. Pestilence is bound to sweep\r\nthis place in the wake of such a--such an affair.\r\n\r\n\"The sights all about here aren't such as you should see. Neither\r\nshould I. We mustn't even think of them. Some way or other we can find\r\na path down out of here, away--away--\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" she cried anxiously, \"but all our treasures? All the tools and\r\ndishes, all the food and clothing, and everything? All our precious,\r\nhard-won things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing left of them now. Down on the fifth floor, at that end of the\r\nbuilding, I'm positive there's nothing but a vast hole blown out of\r\nthe side of the tower. So there's nothing left to salvage. Nothing at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you replace the things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? Wherever we settle down we can get along for a few days on\r\nwhat game I can snare or shoot with the few remaining cartridges. And\r\nafter that--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"After that, once we get established a little, I can come into the\r\ncity and go to raiding again. What we've lost is a mere trifle\r\ncompared to what's left in New York. Why, the latent resources of this\r\nvast ruin haven't been even touched yet! We've got our lives. That's\r\nthe only vital factor. With those everything else is possible. It all\r\nlooks dark and hard to you now, Beatrice. But in a few days--wait and\r\nsee!\"\r\n\r\n\"Allan!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, Beatrice?\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust you in everything. I'm in your hands. Lead me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, then, for the way is long before us. Come!\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, undaunted by the far howling of a wolfpack, as the\r\nwan crescent of the moon came up the untroubled sky, they reached the\r\nbrink of the river, almost due west of where the southern end of\r\nCentral Park hall been.\r\n\r\nThis course, they felt, would avoid any possible encounter with\r\nstragglers of the Horde. Through Madison Forest--or what remained of\r\nit--they had not gone; but had struck eastward from the building, then\r\nnorthward, and so in a wide detour had avoided all the horrors that\r\nthey knew lay near the wreck of the tower.\r\n\r\nThe river, flowing onward to the sea as calmly as though pain and\r\ndeath and ruin and all the dark tragedy of the past night, the past\r\ncenturies, had never been, filled their tired souls and bodies with a\r\ngrateful peace. Slowly, gently it lapped the wooded shore, where docks\r\nand slips had all gone back to nature; the moonlit ripples spoke of\r\nbeauty, life, hope, love.\r\n\r\nThough they could not drink the brackish waters, yet they laved their\r\nfaces, arms and hands, and felt refreshed. Then for some time in\r\nsilence they skirted the flood, ever northward, away from the dead\r\ncity's heart. And the moon rose even higher, higher still, and great\r\nthoughts welled within their hearts. The cool night breeze, freshening\r\nin from the vast salt wastes of the sea--unsailed forever now--cooled\r\ntheir cheeks and soothed the fever of their thoughts.\r\n\r\nWhere the grim ruin of Grant's Tomb looked down upon the river, they\r\ncame at length upon a strange, rude boat, another, then a third--a\r\nwhole flotilla, moored with plaited ropes of grass to trees along the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\"These must certainly be the canoes of the attacking force from\r\nnorthward, the force that fought the Horde the night before _we_ took\r\na hand in the matter; fought, and were beaten, and--devoured,\" said\r\nStern.\r\n\r\nAnd with a practical eye, wise and cool even despite the pain of his\r\nwounded arm, he examined three or four of the boats as best he could\r\nby moonlight.\r\n\r\nThe girl and he agreed on one to use.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this looks like the most suitable,\" judged the engineer,\r\nindicating a rough, banca-like craft nearly sixteen feet long, which\r\nhad been carved and scraped and burned out of a single log.\r\n\r\nHe helped Beatrice in, then cast off the rope. In the bottom lay six\r\npaddles of the most degraded state of workmanship. They showed no\r\ntrace of decoration whatsoever, and the lowest savages of the\r\npre-cataclysmic era had invariably attempted some crude form of art on\r\nnearly every implement.\r\n\r\nThe girl took up one of the paddles.\r\n\r\n\"Which way? Up-stream?\" asked she. \"No, no, you mustn't even try to\r\nuse that arm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why paddle at all?\" Stern answered. \"See here.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed where a short and crooked mast lay, unstopped, along the\r\nside. Lashed to it was a sail of rawhides, clumsily caught together\r\nwith thongs, heavy and stiff, yet full of promise.\r\n\r\nStern laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Back to the coracle stage again,\" said he. \"Back to Caesar's time,\r\nand way beyond!\" And he lifted one end of the mast. \"Here we've got\r\nthe Seuvian pellis pro velis, the 'skins for sails' all over\r\nagain--only more so. Well, no matter. Up she goes!\"\r\n\r\nTogether they stepped the mast and spread the sail. The engineer took\r\nhis place in the stern, a paddle in his left hand. He dipped it, and\r\nthe ripples glinted away.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, in a voice that left no room for argument, \"now, _you_\r\ncurl up in the tiger-skin and go to sleep! This is my job.\"\r\n\r\nThe sail caught the breath of the breeze. The banca moved slowly\r\nforward, trailing its wake like widening lines of silver in the\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\nAnd Beatrice, strong in her trust of him, her confidence and love, lay\r\ndown to sleep while the wounded man steered on and on, and watched her\r\nand protected her. And over all the stars, a glory in the summer sky,\r\nkept silent vigil.\r\n\r\nDawn broke, all a flame of gold and crimson, as they landed in a\r\nsheltered little bay on the west shore.\r\n\r\nHere, though the forest stood unbroken in thick ranges all along the\r\nbackground, it had not yet invaded the slope that led back from the\r\npebbly beach. And through the tangle of what once must have been a\r\nsplendid orchard, they caught a glimpse of white walls overgrown with\r\na mad profusion of wild roses, wisterias and columbines.\r\n\r\n\"This was once upon a time the summer-place, the big concrete bungalow\r\nand all, of Harrison Van Amburg. You know the billionaire, the wheat\r\nman? It used to be all his in the long ago. He built it for all time\r\nof a material that time can never change. It was his. Well, it's ours\r\nnow. Our home!\"\r\n\r\nTogether they stood upon the shelving beach, lapped by the river.\r\nSomewhere in the woods behind them a robin was caroling with liquid\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\nStern drew the rude boat up. Then, breathing deep, he faced the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\"You and I, Beatrice,\" said he, and took her hand. \"Just you--and I!\"\r\n\r\n\"And love!\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"And hope, and life! And the earth reborn. The arts and sciences,\r\nlanguage and letters, truth, 'all the glories of the world' handed\r\ndown through us!\r\n\r\n\"Listen! The race of men, our race, must live again--shall live! Again\r\nthe forests and the plains shall be the conquest of our blood. Once\r\nmore shall cities gleam and tower, ships sail the sea, and the world\r\ngo on to greater wisdom, better things!\r\n\r\n\"A kinder and a saner world this time. No misery, no war, no poverty,\r\nwoe, strife, creeds, oppression, tears--for we are wiser than those\r\nother folk, and there shall be no error.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, his face irradiate. To him recurred the prophecy of\r\nIngersoll, the greatest orator of that other time. And very slowly he\r\nspoke again:\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice, it shall be a world where thrones have crumbled and where\r\nkings are dust. The aristocracy of idleness shall reign no more! A\r\nworld without a slave. Man shall at last be free!\r\n\r\n\"'A world at peace, adorned by every form of art, with music's myriad\r\nvoices thrilled, while lips are rich with words of love and truth. A\r\nworld in which no exile sighs, no prisoner mourns; a world on which\r\nthe gibbet's shadow shall not fall.\r\n\r\n\"'A race without disease of flesh or brain, shapely and fair, the\r\nwedded harmony of form and function. And as I look, life lengthens,\r\njoy deepens, and over all in the great dome shines the eternal star of\r\nhuman hope!'\"\r\n\r\n\"And love?\" she smiled again, a deep and sacred meaning in her words.\r\nWithin her stirred the universal motherhood, the hope of everything,\r\nthe call of the unborn, the insistent voice of the race that was to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\"And love!\" he answered, his voice now very tender, very grave.\r\n\r\nTired, yet strong, he looked upon her. And as he looked his eyes grew\r\ndeep and eager.\r\n\r\nSweet as the honey of Hymettus was the perfume of the orchard, all a\r\npowder of white and rosy blooms, among which the bees, pollen-dusted,\r\nlabored, at their joyous, fructifying task. Fresh, the morning breeze.\r\nClear, warm, radiant, the sun of June; the summer sun uprising far\r\nbeyond the shining hills.\r\n\r\nLife everywhere--and love!\r\n\r\nLove, too, for them. For this man, this woman, love; the mystery, the\r\npleasure and the eternal pain.\r\n\r\nWith his unhurt arm he circled her. He bent, he drew her to him, as\r\nshe raised her face to his.\r\n\r\nAnd for the first time his mouth sought hers.\r\n\r\nTheir lips, long hungry for this madness, met there and blended in a\r\nkiss of passion and of joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nBEYOND THE GREAT OBLIVION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nBEGINNINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nA thousand years of darkness and decay! A thousand years of\r\nblight, brutality, and atavism; of Nature overwhelming all man's work,\r\nof crumbling cities and of forgotten civilization, of stupefaction, of\r\ndeath! A thousand years of night!\r\n\r\nTwo human beings, all alone in that vast wilderness--a woman and a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe past, irrevocable; the present, fraught with problems, perils, and\r\nalarms; the future--what?\r\n\r\nA thousand years!\r\n\r\nYet, though this thousand years had seemingly smeared away all\r\nsemblance of the world of men from the cosmic canvas, Allan Stern and\r\nBeatrice Kendrick thrilled with as vital a passion as though that\r\nvast, oblivious age lay not between them and the time that was.\r\n\r\nAnd their long kiss, there in sight of their new home-to-be--alone\r\nthere in that desolated world--was as natural as the summer breeze,\r\nthe liquid melody of the red-breast on the blossomy apple-bough above\r\ntheir heads, the white and purple spikes of odorous lilacs along the\r\nvine-grown stone wall, the gold and purple dawn now breaking over the\r\ndistant reaches of the river.\r\n\r\nThus were these two betrothed, this sole surviving pair of human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nThus, as the new day burned to living flame up the inverted bowl of\r\nsky, this woman and this man pledged each other their love and loyalty\r\nand trust.\r\n\r\nThus they stood together, his left arm about her warm, lithe body,\r\nclad as she was only in her tiger-skin. Their eyes met and held true,\r\nthere in the golden glory of the dawn. Unafraid, she read the message\r\nin the depths of his, the invitation, the command; and they both\r\nforeknew the future.\r\n\r\nBeatrice spoke first, flushing a little as she drew toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Allan,\" she said with infinite tenderness, even as a mother might\r\nspeak to a well-loved son, \"Allan, come now and let me dress your\r\nwound. That's the first thing to do. Come, let me see your arm.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled a little, and with his broad, brown hand stroked back the\r\nspun silk of her hair, its mass transfixed by the raw gold pins he had\r\nfound for her among the ruins of New York.\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" he objected. \"It's nothing--it's not worth bothering about.\r\nI'll be all right in a day or two. My flesh heals almost at once,\r\nwithout any care. You don't realize how healthy I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, dear, but it must hurt you terribly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurt? How could I feel any pain with your kiss on my mouth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" she again repeated with insistence, and pointed toward the\r\nbeach where their banca lay on the sand.\r\n\r\n\"Come, I'll dress your wound first. And after I find out just how\r\nbadly you're injured--\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to stop her mouth with kisses, but she evaded him.\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" she cried. \"Not now--not now!\"\r\n\r\nAllan had to cede. And now presently there he knelt on the fine white\r\nsand, his bearskin robe opened and flung back, his well-knit shoulder\r\nand sinewed arm bare and brown.\r\n\r\n\"Well, is it fatal?\" he jested. \"How long do you give me to survive\r\nit?\" as with her hand and the cold limpid water of the Hudson she\r\nstarted to lave the caked blood away from his gashed triceps.\r\n\r\nAt sight of the wound she looked grave, but made no comment. She had\r\nno bandages; but with the woodland skill she had developed in the past\r\nweeks of life in close touch with nature, she bound the cleansed wound\r\nwith cooling leaves and fastened them securely in place with lashings\r\nof leather thongs from the banca.\r\n\r\nPresently the task was done. Stern slipped his bearskin back in place.\r\nBeatrice, still solicitous, tried to clasp the silver buckle that held\r\nit; but he, unable to restrain himself, caught her hand in both of his\r\nand crushed it to his lips.\r\n\r\nThen he took her perfect face between his palms, and for a long moment\r\nstudied it. He looked at her waving hair, luxuriant and glinting rich\r\nbrown gleams in the sunlight; her thick, arched brows and hazel eyes,\r\nliquid and full of mystery as woodland pools; her skin, sun-browned\r\nand satiny, with abundant tides of life-blood coursing vigorously in\r\nits warm flush; her ripe lips. He studied her, and loved and yearned\r\ntoward her; and in him the passion leaped up like living flames.\r\n\r\nHis mouth met hers again.\r\n\r\n\"My beloved!\" breathed he.\r\n\r\nHer rounded arm, bare to the shoulder, circled his neck; she hid her\r\nface in his breast.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet--not yet!\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nOn the white and pink flowered bough above, the robin, unafraid,\r\ngushed into a very madness of golden song. And now the sun, higher\r\nrisen, had struck the river into a broad sheet of spun metal, over\r\nwhich the swallows--even as in the olden days--darted and spiraled,\r\nwith now and then a flick and dash of spray.\r\n\r\nFar off, wool-white winding-sheets of mist were lifting, lagging along\r\nthe purple hills, clothed with inviolate forest.\r\n\r\nAgain the man tried to raise her head, to burn his kisses on her\r\nmouth. But she, instilled with the eternal spirit of woman, denied\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"No, not now--not yet!\" she said; and in her eyes he read her meaning.\r\n\"You must let me go now, Allan. There's so much to do; we've got to be\r\npractical, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Practical! When I--I love--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know, dear. But there's so much to be done first.\" Her womanly\r\nhomemaking instinct would not be gainsaid. \"There's so much work!\r\nWe've got the place to explore, and the house to put in order,\r\nand--oh, thousands of things! And we must be very sensible and very\r\nwise, you and I, boy. We're not children, you know. Now that we've\r\nlost our home in the Metropolitan Tower, everything's got to be done\r\nover again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except to learn to love you!\" answered Stern, letting her go with\r\nreluctance.\r\n\r\nShe laughed back at him over her fur-clad shoulder as her sandaled\r\nfeet followed the dim remnants of what must once have been a broad\r\ndriveway from the river road along the beach, leading up to the\r\nbungalow.\r\n\r\nThrough the encroaching forest and the tangle of the degenerate\r\napple-trees they could see the concrete walls, with here or there a\r\nbit of white still gleaming through the enlacements of ancient vines\r\nthat had enveloped the whole structure--woodbine, ivy, wisterias, and\r\nthe maddest jungle of climbing roses, red and yellow, that ever made a\r\nnest for love.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, I'll go first and clear the way for you,\" he said cheerily. His\r\nbig bulk crashed down the undergrowth. His hands held back the thorns\r\nand briers and the whipping hardbacks. Together they slowly made way\r\ntoward the house.\r\n\r\nThe orchard had lost all semblance of regularity, for in the thousand\r\nyears since the hand of man had pruned or cared for it Mother Nature\r\nhad planted and replanted it times beyond counting. Small and gnarled\r\nand crooked the trees were, as the spine-tree souls in Dante's\r\ndolorosa selva.\r\n\r\nHere or there a pine had rooted and grown tall, killing the lesser\r\ntribe of green things underneath.\r\n\r\nWarm lay the sun there. A pleasant carpet of last year's leaves and\r\npine-spills covered the earth.\r\n\r\n\"It's all ready and waiting for us, all embowered and carpeted for\r\nlove,\" said Allan musingly. \"I wonder what old Van Amburg would think\r\nof his estate if he could see it now? And what would he say to our\r\nhaving it? You know, Van was pretty ugly to me at one time about my\r\npolitical opinion--but that's all past and forgotten now. Only this is\r\ncertainly an odd turn of fate.\"\r\n\r\nHe helped the girl over a fallen log, rotted with moss and lichens.\r\n\"It's one awful mess, sure as you're born. But as quick as my arm gets\r\nback into shape, we'll have order out of chaos before you know it.\r\nSome fine day you and I will drive our sixty horse-power car up an\r\nasphalt road here, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"A car? Why, what do you mean? There's not such a thing left in the\r\nwhole world as a car!\"\r\n\r\nThe engineer tapped his forehead with his finger.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, there is. I've got several models right here. You just wait\r\ntill you see the workshop I'm going to install on the bank of the\r\nriver with current-power, and with an electric light plant for the\r\nwhole place, and with--\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice laughed.\r\n\r\n\"You dear, big, dreaming boy!\" she interrupted. Then with a kiss she\r\ntook his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said she. \"We're home now. And there's work to do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSETTLING DOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nTogether, in the comradeship of love and trust and mutual\r\nunderstanding, they reached the somewhat open space before the\r\nbungalow, where once the road had ended in a stone-paved drive.\r\nAllan's wounded arm, had he but sensed it, was beginning to pain more\r\nthan a little. But he was oblivious. His love, the fire of spring that\r\nburned in his blood, the lure of this great adventuring, banished all\r\nconsciousness of ill.\r\n\r\nParting a thicket, they reached the steps. And for a while they stood\r\nthere, hand in hand, silent and thrilled with vast, strange thoughts,\r\ndreaming of what must be. In their eyes lay mirrored the future of the\r\nhuman race. The light that glowed in them evoked the glories of the\r\ndawn of life again, after ten centuries of black oblivion.\r\n\r\n\"Our home now!\" he told her, very gently, and again he kissed her, but\r\nthis time on the forehead. \"Ours when we shall have reclaimed it and\r\nmade it ours. See the yellow roses, dear? They symbolize our golden\r\nfuture. The red, red roses? Our passion and our pain!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl made no answer, but tears gathered in her eyes--tears from\r\nthe deepest wells of the soul. She brought his hand to her lips.\r\n\r\n\"Ours!\" she whispered tremblingly.\r\n\r\nThey stood there together for a little space, silent and glad. From an\r\noak that shaded the porch a squirrel chippered at them. A\r\nsparrow--larger now than the sparrows they remembered in the time that\r\nwas--peered out at them, wondering but unafraid, from its nest under\r\nthe eaves; at them, the first humans it had ever seen.\r\n\r\n\"We've got a tenant already, haven't we?\" smiled Allan. \"Well, I guess\r\nwe sha'n't have to disturb her, unless perhaps for a while, when I cut\r\naway this poison ivy here.\" He pointed at the glossy triple leaf. \"No\r\npoisonous thing, whether plant, snake, spider, or insect, is going to\r\nstay in this Eden!\" he concluded, with a laugh.\r\n\r\nTogether, with a strange sense of violating the spirit of the past,\r\nthey went up the concrete steps, untrodden now by human feet for ten\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThe massive blocks were still intact for the most part, for old Van\r\nAmburg had builded with endless care and with no remotest regard for\r\ncost. Here a vine, there a sapling had managed to insinuate a tap-root\r\nin some crack made by the frost, but the damage was trifling. Except\r\nfor the falling of a part of a cornice, the building was complete. But\r\nit was hidden in vines and mold. Moss, lichens and weeds grew on the\r\nsteps, flourishing in the detritus that had accumulated.\r\n\r\nAllan dug the toe of his sandal into the loose drift of dead leaves\r\nand pine-spills that littered the broad piazza.\r\n\r\n\"It'll need more than a vacuum cleaner to put this in shape!\" said he.\r\n\"Well, the sooner we get at it, the better. We'd do well to take a\r\nlook at the inside.\"\r\n\r\nThe front door, one-time built of oaken planks studded with\r\nhand-worked nails and banded with huge wrought-iron hinges, now hung\r\nthere a mere shell of itself, worm-eaten, crumbling, disintegrated.\r\n\r\nWith no tools but his naked hands Stern tore and battered it away. A\r\nthick, pungent haze of dust arose, yellow in the morning sunlight that\r\npresently, for the first time in a thousand years, fell warm and\r\nbright across the cob-webbed front hallway, through the aperture.\r\n\r\nRoom by room Allan and Beatrice explored. The bungalow was practically\r\nstripped bare by time.\r\n\r\n\"Only moth and rust,\" sighed the girl. \"The same story everywhere we\r\ngo. But--well, never mind. We'll soon have it looking homelike. Make\r\nme a broom, dear, and I'll sweep out the worst of it at once.\"\r\n\r\nTalking now in terms of practical detail, with romance for the hour\r\ndisplaced by harsh reality, they examined the entire house.\r\n\r\nOf the once magnificent furnishings, only dust-piles, splinters and\r\npunky rubbish remained. Through the rotted plank shutters, that hung\r\ndrunkenly awry from rust-eaten hinges, long spears of sunlight wanly\r\nilluminated the wreck of all that had once been the lavish home of a\r\nbillionaire.\r\n\r\nRugs, paintings, furniture, _bibelots_, treasures of all kinds now lay\r\ncommingled in mournful decay. In what had evidently been the music\r\nroom, overlooking the grounds to southward, the grand piano now was\r\nonly a mass of rusted frame, twisted and broken fragments of wire and\r\na considerable heap of wood-detritus, with a couple of corroded pedals\r\nburied in the pile.\r\n\r\n\"And _this_ was the famous hundred-thousand-dollar harp of Sara, his\r\ndaughter, that the papers used to talk so much about, you remember?\"\r\nasked the girl, stirring with her foot a few mournful bits of rubbish\r\nthat lay near the piano.\r\n\r\n\"Sic transit gloria mundi!\" growled Stern, shaking his head. \"You\r\nand she were the same age, almost. And now--\"\r\n\r\nSilent and full of strange thoughts they went on into what had been\r\nthe kitchen. The stove, though heavily bedded in rust, retained its\r\nform, for the solid steel had resisted even the fearful lapse of\r\nvanished time.\r\n\r\n\"After I scour that with sand and water,\" said Stern, \"and polish up\r\nthese aluminum utensils and reset that broken pane with a piece of\r\nglass from up-stairs where it isn't needed, you won't know this place.\r\nYes, and I'll have running water in here, too--and electricity from\r\nthe power-plant, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Allan,\" interrupted the girl, delightedly, \"this must have been\r\nthe dining room.\" She beckoned from a doorway. \"No end of dishes left\r\nfor us! Isn't it jolly? This is luxury compared to the way we had to\r\nstart in the tower!\"\r\n\r\nIn the dining-room a good number of the more solid cut-glass and china\r\npieces had resisted the shock of having fallen, centuries ago, to the\r\nfloor, when the shelves and cupboards of teak and mahogany had rotted\r\nand gone to pieces. Corroded silverware lay scattered all about; and\r\nthere was gold plate, too, intact save for the patina of extreme\r\nage--platters, dishes, beakers. But of the table and the chairs,\r\nnothing remained save dust.\r\n\r\nLike curious children they poked and pried.\r\n\r\n\"Dishes enough!\" exclaimed she. \"Gold, till you can't rest. But how\r\nabout something to put _on_ the dishes? We haven't had a bite since\r\nyesterday noon, and I'm about starved. Now that the fighting's all\r\nover, I begin to remember my healthy appetite!\"\r\n\r\nStern smiled.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have some breakfast, girlie,\" promised he. \"There'll be the\r\nwherewithal to garnish our 18-k, never fear. Just let's have a look\r\nup-stairs, and then I'll go after something for the larder.\"\r\n\r\nThey left the down-stairs rooms, silent save for a fly buzzing in a\r\nspider's web, and together ascended the dusty stairs. The railing was\r\nentirely gone; but the concrete steps remained.\r\n\r\nStern helped the girl, in spite of the twinge of pain it caused his\r\nwounded arm. His heart beat faster--so, too, did hers--as they gained\r\nthe upper story. The touch of her was, to him, like a lighted match\r\nflung into a powder magazine; but he bit his lip, and though his face\r\npaled, then flushed, he held his voice steady as he said:\r\n\r\n\"So then, bats up here? Well, how the deuce do they get in and out?\r\nAh! That broken window, where the elm-branch has knocked out the\r\nglass--I see! That's got to be fixed at once!\"\r\n\r\nHe brushed webs and dust from the remaining panes, and together they\r\npeered out over the orchard, out across the river, now a broad sheet\r\nof molten gold. His arm went about her; he drew her head against his\r\nheart, fast-beating; and silence fell.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Allan,\" said the girl at length, calmer than he. \"Let's see\r\nwhat we've got here to do with. Oh, I tell you to begin with,\" and she\r\nsmiled up frankly at him, \"I'm a tremendously practical sort of woman.\r\nYou may be an engineer, and know how to build wireless telegraphs and\r\nbridges and--and things; but when it comes to home--building--\"\r\n\r\n\"I admit it. Well, lead on,\" he answered; and together they explored\r\nthe upper rooms. The sense of intimacy now lay strong upon them, of\r\nunity and of indissoluble love and comradeship. This was quite another\r\nventure than the exploration of the tower, for now they were choosing\r\na home, _their_ home, and in them the mating instinct had begun to\r\nthrill, to burn.\r\n\r\nEach room, despite its ruin and decay, took on a special charm, a\r\ndignity, the foreshadowing of what must be. Yet intrinsically the\r\nplace was mournful, even after Stern had let the sunshine in.\r\n\r\nFor all was dark desolation. The rosewood and mahogany furniture,\r\npictures, rugs, brass beds, all alike lay reduced to dust and ashes. A\r\ngold clock, the porcelain fittings of the bath-room, and some fine\r\nclay and meerschaum pipes in what had evidently been Van Amburg's\r\nden--these constituted all that had escaped the tooth of time.\r\n\r\nIn a front room that probably had been Sara's, a mud-swallow had built\r\nits nest in the far corner. It flew out, frightened, when Stern thrust\r\nhis hand into the aperture to see if the nest were tenanted, fluttered\r\nabout with scared cries, then vanished up the broad fireplace.\r\n\r\n\"Eggs--warm!\" announced Stern. \"Well, this room will have to be shut\r\nup and left. We've got more than enough, anyhow. Less work for you,\r\ndear,\" he added, with a smile. \"We might use only the lower floor, if\r\nyou like. I don't want you killing yourself with housework, you\r\nunderstand.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed cheerily.\r\n\r\n\"You make me a broom and get all the dishes and things together,\" she\r\nanswered, \"and then leave the rest to me. In a week from now you won't\r\nknow this place. Once we clear out a little foothold here we can go\r\nback to the tower and fetch up a few loads of tools and supplies--\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, come on!\" he interrupted, taking her by the hand and leading\r\nher away. \"All such planning will do after breakfast, but I'm\r\nstarving! How about a five-pound bass on the coals, eh? Come on, let's\r\ngo fishing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE MASKALONGE\r\n\r\n\r\nWith characteristic resourcefulness Stein soon manufactured\r\nadequate tackle with a well-trimmed alder pole, a line of leather\r\nthongs and a hook of stout piano wire, properly bent to make a barb\r\nand rubbed to a fine point on a stone. He caught a dozen young frogs\r\namong the sedges in the marshy stretch at the north end of the\r\nlanding-beach, and confined them in the only available receptacle, the\r\nholster of his automatic.\r\n\r\nAll this hurt his arm severely, but he paid no heed.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he announced, \"we're quite ready for business. Come along!\"\r\n\r\nTogether they pushed the boat off; it glided smoothly out onto the\r\nbreast of the great current.\r\n\r\n\"I'll paddle,\" she volunteered. \"You mustn't, with your arm in the\r\ncondition it is. Which way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Up--over there into that cove beyond the point,\" he answered, baiting\r\nup his hook with a frog that kicked as naturally as though a full\r\nthousand years hadn't passed since any of its progenitors had been\r\nhandled thus. \"This certainly is far from being the kind of tackle\r\nthat Bob Davis or any of that gang used to swear by, but it's the best\r\nwe can do for now. When I get to making lines and hooks and things in\r\nearnest, there'll be some sport in this vicinity. Imagine water\r\nuntouched by the angler for ten hundred years or more!\"\r\n\r\nHe swung his clumsy line as he spoke, and cast. Far across the shining\r\nwater the circles spread, silver in the morning light; then the\r\ntrailing line cut a long series of V's as the girl paddled slowly\r\ntoward the cove. Behind the banca a rippling wake flashed metallic;\r\nthe cold, clear water caressed the primitive hull, murmuring with soft\r\ncadences, in the old, familiar music of the time when there were men\r\non earth. The witchery of it stirred Beatrice; she smiled, looked up\r\nwith joy and wonder at the beauty of that perfect morning, and in her\r\nclear voice began to sing, very low, very softly, to herself, a song\r\nwhereof--save in her brain--no memory now remained in the whole\r\nworld--\r\n\r\n  \"Stark wie der Fels,\r\n   Tief wie das Meer,\r\n   Muss deine Liebe, muss deine Liebe sein--\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ah!_\" cried the man, interrupting her.\r\n\r\nThe alder pole was jerking, quivering in his hands; the leather line\r\nwas taut.\r\n\r\n\"A strike, so help me! A big one!\"\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his feet, and, unmindful of the swaying of the banca,\r\nbegan to play the fish.\r\n\r\nBeatrice, her eyes a-sparkle, turned to watch; the paddle lay\r\nforgotten in her hands.\r\n\r\n\"Here he comes! Oh, _damn!_\" shouted Stern. \"If I only had a reel\r\nnow--\"\r\n\r\n\"Pull him right in, can't you?\" the girl suggested.\r\n\r\nHe groaned, between clenched teeth--for the strain on his arm was\r\ntorture.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and have him break the line!\" he cried. \"There he goes, under\r\nthe boat, now! Paddle! Go ahead--paddle!\"\r\n\r\nShe seized the oar, and while Stern fought the monster she set the\r\nbanca in motion again. Now the fish was leaping wildly from side to\r\nside, zig-zagging, shaking at the hook as a bull-dog shakes an old\r\nboot. The leather cord hummed through the water, ripping and\r\nvibrating, taut as a fiddle-string. A long, silvery line of bubbles\r\nfollowed the vibrant cord.\r\n\r\n_Flash!_\r\n\r\nHigh in air, lithe and graceful and very swift, a spurt of green and\r\nwhite--a long, slim curve of glistening power--a splash; and again the\r\ncord drew hard.\r\n\r\n\"Maskalonge!\" Stern cried. \"Oh, we've got to land him--got to! Fifteen\r\npounds if he's an ounce!\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice, flushed and eager, watched the fight with fascination.\r\n\r\n\"If I can bring him close, you strike--hit hard!\" the man directed.\r\n\"Give it to him! He's our breakfast!\"\r\n\r\nEven in the excitement of the battle Stern realized how very beautiful\r\nthis woman was. Her color was adorable--rose-leaves and cream. Her\r\neyes were shot full of light and life and the joy of living; her\r\nloosened hair, wavy and rich and brown, half hid the graceful curve of\r\nher neck as she leaned to watch, to help him.\r\n\r\nAnd strong determination seized him to master this great fish, to land\r\nit, to fling it at the woman's feet as his tribute and his trophy.\r\n\r\nHe had, in the days of long ago, fished in the Adirondack\r\nwildernesses. He had fished for tarpon in the Gulf; he had cast the\r\nfly along the brooks of Maine and lured the small-mouthed bass with\r\nfloating bait on many a lake and stream. He had even fished in a Rocky\r\nMountain torrent, and out on the far Columbia, when failure to succeed\r\nmeant hunger.\r\n\r\nBut this experience was unique. Never had he fished all alone in the\r\nworld with a loved woman who depended on his skill for her food, her\r\nlife, her everything.\r\n\r\nForgotten now the wounded arm, the crude and absurd implements;\r\nforgotten everything but just that sole, indomitable thought: \"I've\r\ngot to win!\"\r\n\r\nCame now a lull in the struggles of the monster. Stern hauled in.\r\nAnother rush, met by a paying-out, a gradual tautening of the line, a\r\nstrong and steady pull.\r\n\r\n\"He's tiring,\" exulted Stern. \"Be ready when I bring him close!\"\r\n\r\nAgain the fish broke cover; again it dived; but now its strength was\r\nlessening fast.\r\n\r\nAllan hauled in.\r\n\r\nNow, far down in the clear depths, they could both see the darting,\r\nflickering shaft of white and green.\r\n\r\n\"Up he comes now! Give it to him, hard!\"\r\n\r\nAs Stern brought him to the surface, Beatrice struck with the\r\npaddle--once, twice, with magnificent strength and judgment.\r\n\r\nOver the gunwale of the banca, in a sparkle of flying spray, silvery\r\nin the morning sun, the maskalonge gleamed.\r\n\r\nExcited and happy as a child, Beatrice clapped her hands. Stern seized\r\nthe paddle as she let it fall. A moment later the huge fish, stunned\r\nand dying, lay in the bottom of the boat, its gills rising, falling in\r\nconvulsive gasps, its body quivering, scales shining in the\r\nsunlight--a thing of wondrous beauty, a promise of the feast for two\r\nstrong, healthy humans.\r\n\r\nStern dried his brow on the back of his hand and drew a deep breath,\r\nfor the morning was already warm and the labor had been hard.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, and smiled, \"now a nice little pile of dead wood on\r\nthe beach, a curl of birch-bark and a handful of pine punk and\r\ngrass--a touch of the flint and steel! Then _this_,\" and he pointed at\r\nthe maskalonge, \"broiled on a pointed stick, with a handful of\r\ncheckerberries for dessert, and I think you and I will be about ready\r\nto begin work in earnest!\"\r\n\r\nHe knelt and kissed her--a kiss that she returned--and then, slowly,\r\nhappily, and filled with the joy of comradeship, they drove their\r\nbanca once more to the white and gleaming beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN AGE\r\n\r\n\r\nStern's plans of hard work for the immediate present had to be\r\ndeferred a little, for in spite of his perfect health, the\r\nspear-thrust in his arm--lacking the proper treatment, and irritated\r\nby his labor in catching the big fish--developed swelling and\r\nsoreness. A little fever even set in the second day. And though he was\r\neager to go out fishing again, Beatrice appointed herself his nurse\r\nand guardian, and withheld permission.\r\n\r\nThey lived for some days on the excellent flesh of the maskalonge, on\r\nclams from the beach--enormous clams of delicious flavor--on a new\r\nfruit with a pinkish meat, which grew abundantly in the thickets and\r\nsomewhat resembled breadfruit; on wild asparagus-sprouts, and on the\r\nfew squirrels that Stern was able to \"pot\" with his revolver from the\r\nshelter of the leafy little camping-place they had arranged near the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nThough Beatrice worked many hours all alone in the bungalow, sweeping\r\nit with a broom made of twigs lashed to a pole, and trying to bring\r\nthe place into order, it was still no fit habitation.\r\n\r\nShe would not even let the man try to help her, but insisted on his\r\nkeeping quiet in their camp. This lay under the shelter of a\r\nthick-foliaged oak at the southern end of the beach. The perfect\r\nweather and the presence of a three-quarters moon at night invited\r\nthem to sleep out under the sky.\r\n\r\n\"There'll be plenty of time for the bungalow,\" she said, \"when it\r\nrains. As long as we have fair June weather like this no roof shall\r\ncover me!\"\r\n\r\nSingularly enough, there were no mosquitoes. In the thousand years\r\nthat had elapsed, they might either have shifted their habitat from\r\neastern America, or else some obscure evolutionary process might have\r\nwiped them out entirely. At any rate, none existed, for which the two\r\nadventurers gave thanks.\r\n\r\nWild beasts they feared not. Though now and then they heard the yell\r\nof a wildcat far back in the woods, or the tramping of an occasional\r\nbulk through the forest, and though once a cinnamon bear poked his\r\nmuzzle out into the clearing, sniffed and departed with a grunt of\r\ndisapproval, they could not bring themselves to any realization of\r\nanimals as a real peril. Their camp-fire burned high all night, heaped\r\nwith driftwood and windfalls; and beyond this protection, Stern had\r\nhis automatic and a belt nearly full of cartridges. They discussed the\r\nquestion of a possible attack by some remnants of the Horde; but\r\ncommon sense assured them that these creatures would--such as\r\nsurvived--give them a wide berth.\r\n\r\n\"And in any event,\" Stern summed it up, \"if anything happens, we have\r\nthe bungalow to retreat into. Though in its present state, without any\r\ndoors or shutters, I think we're safer out among the trees, where, on\r\na pinch, we could go aloft.\"\r\n\r\nThus his convalescence progressed in the open air, under the clouds\r\nand sun and stars and lustrous moon of that deserted world.\r\n\r\nBeatrice showed both skill and ingenuity in her treatment. With a\r\nclam-shell she scraped and saved the rich fat from under the skins of\r\nthe squirrels, and this she \"tried out\" in a golden dish, over the\r\nfire. The oil thus got she used to anoint his healing wound. She used\r\na dressing of clay and leaves; and when the fever flushed him she made\r\nhim comfortable on his bed of spruce-tips, bathed his forehead and\r\ncheeks, and gave him cold water from a spring that trickled down over\r\nthe moss some fifty feet to westward of the camp.\r\n\r\nMany a long talk they had, too--he prone on the spruce, she sitting\r\nbeside him, tending the fire, holding his hand or letting his head lie\r\nin her lap, the while she stroked his hair. Ferns, flowers in\r\nprofusion--lilacs and clover and climbing roses and some new, strange\r\nscarlet blossoms--bowered their nest. And through the pain and fever,\r\nthe delay and disappointment, they both were glad and cheerful. No\r\nword of impatience or haste or repining escaped them. For they had\r\nlife; they had each other; they had love. And those days, as later\r\nthey looked back upon them, were among the happiest, the most purely\r\nbeautiful, the sweetest of their whole wondrous, strange experience.\r\n\r\nHe and she, perfect friends, comrades and lovers, were inseparable.\r\nEach was always conscious of the other's presence. The continuity of\r\nlove, care and sympathy was never broken. Even when, at daybreak, she\r\nwent away around the wooded point for her bath in the river, he could\r\nhear her splashing and singing and laughing happily in the cold water.\r\n\r\nIt was the Golden Age come back to earth again--the age of natural and\r\npure simplicity, truth, trust, honor, faith and joy, unspoiled by\r\nmalice or deceit, by lies, conventions, sordid ambitions, or the lust\r\nof wealth or power. Arcady, at last--in truth!\r\n\r\nTheir conversation was of many things. They talked of their awakening\r\nin the tower and their adventures there; of the possible cause of the\r\nworld-catastrophe that had wiped out the human race, save for their\r\nown survival; the Horde and the great battle; their escape, their\r\npresent condition, and their probable future; the possibility of their\r\never finding any other isolated human beings, and of reconstituting\r\nthe fragments of the world or of renewing the human race.\r\n\r\nAnd as they spoke of this, sometimes the girl would grow strangely\r\nsilent, and a look almost of inspiration--the universal mother--look\r\nof the race--would fill her wondrous eye's. Her hand would tremble in\r\nhis; but he would hold it tight, for he, too, understood.\r\n\r\n\"Afraid, little girl?\" he asked her once.\r\n\r\n\"No, not afraid,\" she answered; and their eyes met. \"Only--so much\r\ndepends on us--on you, on me! What strength we two must have, what\r\ncourage, what endurance! The future of the human race lies in our\r\nhands!\"\r\n\r\nHe made no answer; he, too, grew silent. And for a long while they sat\r\nand watched the embers of the fire; and the day waned. Slowly the sun\r\nset in its glory over the virgin hills; the far eastern spaces of the\r\nsky grew bathed in tender lavenders and purples. Haze drew its veils\r\nacross the world, and the air grew brown with evenfall.\r\n\r\nPresently the girl arose, to throw more wood on the fire. Clad only in\r\nher loose tiger-skin, clasped with gold, she moved like a primeval\r\ngoddess. Stern marked the supple play of her muscles, the unspoiled\r\ngrace and strength of that young body, the swelling warmth of her\r\nbosom. And as he looked he loved; he pressed a hand to his eyes; for a\r\nwhile he thought--it was as though he prayed.\r\n\r\nEvening came on--the warm, dark, mysterious night. Off there in the\r\nshallows gradually arose the million-voiced chorus of frogs, shrill\r\nand monotonous, plaintive, appealing--the cry of new life to the\r\noverarching, implacable mystery of the universe. The first faint\r\nsilvery powder of the stars came spangling out along the horizon.\r\nUnsteady bats began to reel across the sky. The solemn beauty of the\r\nscene awed the woman and the man to silence. But Stern, leaning his\r\nback against the bole of the great oak, encircled Beatrice with his\r\narm.\r\n\r\nHer beautiful dear head rested in the hollow of his throat; her warm,\r\nfragrant hair caressed his cheek; he felt the wholesome strength and\r\nsweetness of this woman whom he loved; and in his eyes--unseen by\r\nher--tears welled and gleamed in the firelight.\r\n\r\nBeatrice watched, like a contented child, the dancing showers of\r\nsparks that rose, wavering and whirling in complex sarabands--sparks\r\nred as passion, golden as the unknown future of their dreams. From the\r\nriver they heard the gentle lap-lap-lapping of the waves along the\r\nshore. All was rest and peace and beauty; this was Eden once\r\nagain--and there was no serpent to enter in.\r\n\r\nPresently Stern spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Dear,\" said he, \"do you know, I'm a bit puzzled in some ways,\r\nabout--well, about night and day, and temperature, and gravitation,\r\nand a number of little things like that. Puzzled. We're facing\r\nproblems here that we don't realize fully as yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Problems? What problems, except to make our home, and--and live?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, there's more to be considered than just that. In the first place,\r\nalthough I have no timepiece, I'm moderately certain the day and night\r\nare shorter now than they used to be before the smash-up. There must\r\nbe a difference of at least half an hour. Just as soon as I can get\r\naround to it, I'll build a clock, and see. Though if the force of\r\ngravity has changed, too, that, of course, will change the time of\r\nvibration of any pendulum, and so of course will invalidate my\r\nresults. It's a hard problem, right enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think gravitation has changed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you notice, yourself, that things seem a trifle lighter--things\r\nthat used to be heavy to lift are now comparatively easy?\"\r\n\r\n\"M-m-m-m-m--I don't know. I thought maybe it was because I was\r\nfeeling so much stronger, with this new kind of outdoor life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, that's worth considering,\" answered Stern, \"but there's\r\nmore in it than that. The world is certainly smaller than it was,\r\nthough how, or why, I can't say. Things are lighter, and the time of\r\nrotation is shorter. Another thing, the pole-star is certainly five\r\ndegrees out of place. The axis of the earth has been given an\r\nastonishing twist, some way or other.\r\n\r\n\"And don't you notice a distinct change in the climate? In the old\r\ndays there were none of these huge, palm-like ferns growing in this\r\npart of the world. We had no such gorgeous butterflies. And look at\r\nthe new varieties of flowers--and the breadfruit, or whatever it is,\r\ngrowing on the banks of the Hudson in the early part of June!\r\n\r\n\"Something, I tell you, has happened to the earth, in all these\r\ncenturies; something big! Maybe the cause of it all was the original\r\ncatastrophe; who knows? It's up to us to find out. We've got more to\r\ndo than make our home, and live, and hunt for other people--if any are\r\nstill alive. We've got to solve these world--problems; we've got work\r\nto do, little girl. Work--big work!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've got to rest _now_, anyhow,\" she dictated. \"Now, stop\r\nthinking and planning, and just rest! Till your wound is healed,\r\nyou're going to keep good and quiet.\"\r\n\r\nSilence fell again between them. Then, as the east brightened with the\r\napproach of the moon, she sang the song he loved best--\"Ave Maria,\r\nGratia Plena\"--in her soft, sweet voice, untrained, unspoiled by false\r\nconventions. And Stern, listening, forgot his problems and his plans;\r\npeace came to his soul, and rest and joy.\r\n\r\nThe song ended. And now the moon, with a silent majesty that shamed\r\nhuman speech, slid her bright silver plate up behind the fret of trees\r\non the far hills. Across the river a shimmering path of light grew,\r\nbroadening; and the world beamed in holy beauty, as on the primal\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAnd their souls drank that beauty. They were glad, as never yet. At\r\nlast Stern spoke.\r\n\r\n\"It's more like a dream than a reality, isn't it?\" said he. \"Too\r\nwonderful to be true. Makes me think of Alfred de Musset's 'Lucie.'\r\nYou remember the poem?\r\n\r\n  \"'Un soir, nous etions seuls,\r\n   J'etais assis pres d'elle . ..'\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know!\" she whispered. \"How could I forget it? And to think\r\nthat for a thousand years the moon's been shining just the same, and\r\nnobody--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but _is_ it the same?\" interrupted Stern suddenly, his practical\r\nturn of mind always reasserting itself. \"Don't you see a difference?\r\nYou remember the old-time face in the moon, of course. Where is it\r\nnow? The moon always presented only one side, the same side, to us in\r\nthe old days. How about it now? If I'm not mistaken, things have\r\nshifted up there. We're looking now at some other face of it. And if\r\nthat's so it means a far bigger disarrangement of the solar system and\r\nthe earth's orbit and lots of things than you or I suspect!\r\n\r\n\"Wait till we get back to New York for half a day, and visit the tower\r\nand gather up our things. Wait till I get hold of my binoculars again!\r\nPerhaps some of these questions may be resolved. We can't go on this\r\nway, surrounded by perpetual puzzles, problems, mysteries! We must--\"\r\n\r\n\"Do nothing but rest now!\" she dictated with mock severity.\r\n\r\nStern laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you're the boss,\" he answered, and leaned back against the oak.\r\n\"Only, may I propound one more question?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that dark patch in the sky? Sort of a roughly circular\r\nhole in the blue, as it were--right there?\" He pointed. \"Where there\r\naren't any stars?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--yes. What about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's moving, that's all. Every night that black patch moves among the\r\nstars, and cuts their light off; and one night it grazed the\r\nmoon--passed before the eastern limb of it, you understand. Made a\r\npartial eclipse. You were asleep; I didn't bother you about it. But if\r\nthere's a new body in the sky, it's up to us to know why, and what\r\nabout it, and all. So the quicker--\"\r\n\r\n\"The quicker you get well, the better all around!\"\r\n\r\nShe drew his head down and kissed him tenderly on the forehead with\r\nthat strange, innate maternal instinct which makes women love to\r\n\"mother\" men even ten years older than themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you worry your brains about all these problems and vexations\r\nto-night, Allan. Your getting well is the main thing. The whole\r\nworld's future hangs on just that! Do you realize what it means? Do\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, as far as the human brain _can_ realize so big a concept.\r\nLanguages, arts, science, all must be handed down to the race by us.\r\nThe world can't begin again on any higher plane than just the level of\r\nour collective intelligence. All that the world knows to-day is stored\r\nin your brain-cells and mine! And our speech, our methods, our ideals,\r\nwill shape the whole destiny of the earth. Our ideals! We must keep\r\nthem very pure!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pure and unspotted,\" she answered simply. Then with an adorable and\r\nfeminine anticlimax:\r\n\r\n\"Dear, does your shoulder pain you now? I'm awfully heavy to be\r\nleaning on you like this!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not hurting me a bit. On the contrary, your touch, your\r\npresence, are life to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite sure you're comfy, boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Positive.\"\r\n\r\n\"And happy?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the limit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm so glad. Because I am, too. I'm awfully sleepy, Allan. Do you\r\nmind if I take just a little, tiny nap?\"\r\n\r\nFor all answer he patted her, and smoothed her hair, her cheek, her\r\nfull, warm throat.\r\n\r\nPresently by her slow, gentle breathing he knew she was asleep.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he half-lay there against the oak, softly swathed in\r\nhis bear-skin, on the odorous bed of fir, holding her in his arms,\r\nlooking into the dancing firelight.\r\n\r\nAnd night wore on, calm, perfumed, gentle; and the thoughts of the man\r\nwere long, long thoughts--thoughts \"that do often lie too deep for\r\ntears.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDEADLY PERIL\r\n\r\n\r\nPages on pages would not tell the full details of the following\r\nweek--the talks they had, the snaring and shooting of small game, the\r\nfishing, the cleaning out of the bungalow, and the beginnings of some\r\norder in the estate, the rapid healing of Stern's arm, and all the\r\nmultifarious little events of their new beginnings of life there by\r\nthe river-bank.\r\n\r\nBut there are other matters of more import than such homely things; so\r\nnow we come to the time when Stern felt the pressing imperative of a\r\nreturn to the tower. For he lacked tools in every way; he needed them\r\nto build furniture, doors, shutters; to clear away the brush and make\r\nthe place orderly, rational and beautiful; to start work on his\r\nprojected laboratory and power-plant; for a thousand purposes.\r\n\r\nHe wanted his binoculars, his shotgun and rifles, and much ammunition,\r\nas well as a boat-load of canned supplies and other goods.\r\nInstruments, above all, he had to have.\r\n\r\nSo, though Beatrice still, with womanly conservatism, preferred to let\r\nwell enough alone for the present, and stay away from the scene of\r\nsuch ghastly deeds as had taken place on the last day of the invasion\r\nby the Horde, Stern eventually convinced and overargued her; and on\r\nwhat he calculated to be the 16th day of June, 2912--the tenth day\r\nsince the fight--they set sail for Manhattan. A favoring northerly\r\nbreeze, joined with a clear sky and sunshine of unusual brilliancy,\r\nmade the excursion a gala time for both. As they put their supplies of\r\nfish, squirrel-meat and breadfruit aboard the banca and shoved the\r\nrude craft off the sand, both she and he felt like children on an\r\nouting.\r\n\r\nAllan's arm was now so well that he permitted himself the luxury of a\r\nmorning plunge. The invigoration of this was still upon him as, with a\r\nsong, he raised the clumsy skin sail upon the rough-hewn mast.\r\nBeatrice curled down in her tiger-skin at the stern, took one of the\r\npaddles, and made ready to steer. He settled himself beside her, the\r\nthongs of his sail in his hand. Thus happy in comradeship, they sailed\r\naway to southward, down the blue wonder of the river, flanked by\r\nheadlands, wooded heights, crags, cliffs and Palisades, now all alike\r\ndeserted.\r\n\r\nNoon found them opposite the fluted columns of gray granite that once\r\nhad borne aloft the suburbs of Englewood. Stern recognized the\r\nconformation of the place; but though he looked hard, could find no\r\ntrace of the Interstate Park road that once had led from top to bottom\r\nof the Palisades, nor any remnant of the millionaires' palaces along\r\nthe heights there.\r\n\r\n\"Stone and brick have long since vanished as structures,\" he\r\ncommented. \"Only steel and concrete have stood the gaff of uncounted\r\nyears! Where all that fashion, wealth and beauty once would have\r\nscorned to notice us, girl, now what's left? Hear the cry of that\r\ngull? The barking of that fox? See that green flicker over the\r\npinnacle? Some new, bright bird, never dreamed of in this country! And\r\neven with the naked eye I can make out the palms and the lianas\r\ntangled over the verge of what must once have been magnificent\r\ngardens!\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed at the heights.\r\n\r\n\"Once,\" said he, \"I was consulted by a sausage-king named Breitkopf,\r\nwho wanted to sink an elevator-shaft from the top to the bottom of\r\nthis very cliff, so he could reach his hundred-thousand-dollar launch\r\nin ease. Breitkopf didn't like my price; he insulted me in several\r\nrather unpleasant ways. The cliff is still here, I see. So am I. But\r\nBreitkopf is--elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed, and swept the river with a glance.\r\n\r\n\"Steer over to the eastward, will you?\" he asked. \"We'll go in through\r\nSpuyten Duyvil and the Harlem. That'll bring us much nearer the tower\r\nthan by landing on the west shore of Manhattan.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours later they had run past the broken arches of Fordham,\r\nWashington, and High Bridges, and following the river--on both banks\r\nof which a few scattered ruins showed through the massed foliage--were\r\ndrawing toward Randall's and Ward's islands and Hell Gate.\r\n\r\nWind and tide still favored them. In safety they passed the ugly\r\nshoals and ledges. Here Stern took the paddle, while Beatrice went to\r\nthe bow and left all to his directing hand.\r\n\r\nBy three o'clock in the afternoon they were drawing past Blackwell's\r\nIsland. The Queensboro Bridge still stood, as did the railway bridges\r\nbehind them; but much wreckage had fallen into the river, and in one\r\nplace formed an ugly whirlpool, which Stern had to avoid by some hard\r\nwork with the paddle.\r\n\r\nThe whole structure was sagging badly to southward, as though the\r\nfoundations had given way. Long, rusted masses of steel hung from the\r\nspans, which drooped as though to break at any moment. Though all the\r\nflooring had vanished centuries before, Stern judged an active man\r\ncould still make his way across the bridge.\r\n\r\n\"That's their engineering,\" gibed he, as the little boat sailed under\r\nand they looked up like dwarfs at the legs of a Colossus. \"The old\r\nRoman bridges are good for practically eternity, but these jerry steel\r\nthings, run up for profits, go to pieces in a mere thousand years!\r\nWell, the steel magnates are gone now, and their profits with them.\r\nBut this junk remains as a lesson and a warning, Beta; the race to\r\ncome must build better than this, and sounder, every way!\"\r\n\r\nOn, on they sailed, marveling at the terrific destruction on either\r\nhand--the dense forests now grown over Brooklyn and New York alike.\r\n\r\n\"We'll be there before long now,\" said Allan. \"And if we have any luck\r\nat all, and nothing happens, we ought to be started for home by\r\nnightfall. You don't mind a moonlight sail up the Hudson, do you?\"\r\n\r\nIt was past four by the time the banca nosed her way slowly in among\r\nthe rotten docks and ruined hulks of steamships, and with a gentle\r\nrustling came to rest among the reeds and rushes now growing rank at\r\nthe foot of what had once been Twenty-Third Street.\r\n\r\nA huge sea-tortoise, disturbed, slid off the sand-bank where he had\r\nbeen sunning himself and paddled sulkily away. A blue heron flapped up\r\nfrom the thicket, and with a frog in its bill awkwardly took flight,\r\nits long neck crooked, legs dangling absurdly.\r\n\r\n\"Some mighty big changes, all right,\" commented Stern. \"Yes, there's\r\ngot to be a deal of work done here before things are right again. But\r\nthere's time enough, time enough--there's all the time we need, we and\r\nthe people who shall come after us!\"\r\n\r\nThey made the banca fast, noting that the tide was high and that the\r\nleather cord was securely tied to a gnarled willow that grew at the\r\nwater's edge. Half an hour later they had made their way across town\r\nto Madison Avenue.\r\n\r\nIt was with strange feelings they once more approached the scene of\r\ntheir battle against such frightful odds with the Horde. Stern was\r\nespecially curious to note the effect of his Pulverite, not only on\r\nthe building itself but on the square.\r\n\r\nThis effect exceeded his expectations. Less than two hundred feet of\r\nthe tower now stood and the whole western facade was but a mass of\r\ncracked and gaping ruin.\r\n\r\nOut on the Square the huge elms and pines had been uprooted and flung\r\nin titanic confusion, like a game of giants' jack-straws. And vast\r\nconical excavations showed, here and there, where vials of the\r\nexplosive had struck the earth. Gravel and rocks had even been thrown\r\nover the Metropolitan Building itself into the woodland glades of\r\nMadison Avenue. And, worse, bits of bone--a leg-bone, a\r\nshoulder-blade, a broken skull with flesh still adhering--here or\r\nthere met the eye.\r\n\r\n\"Mighty good thing the vultures have been busy here,\" commented Stern.\r\n\"If they hadn't, the place wouldn't be even approachable. Gad! I thank\r\nmy stars what we've got to do won't take more than an hour. If we had\r\nto stay here after dark I'd surely have the creeps, in spite of all my\r\nscientific materialism! Well, no use being retrospective. We're living\r\nin the present and future now; not the past. Got the plaited cords\r\nBeatrice? We'll need them before long to make up our bundle with.\"\r\n\r\nThus talking, Stern kept the girl from seeing too much or brooding\r\nover what she saw. He engaged her actively on the work in hand. Until\r\nhe had assured himself there was no danger from falling fragments in\r\nthe shattered halls and stairways that led up to the gaping ruin at\r\nthe truncated top of the tower he would not let her enter the\r\nbuilding, but set her to fashioning a kind of puckered bag with a huge\r\nskin taken from the furrier's shop in the Arcade, while he explored.\r\n\r\nHe returned after a while, and together they climbed over the debris\r\nand ruins to the upper rooms which had been their home during the\r\nfirst few days after the awakening.\r\n\r\nThe silence of death that lay over the place was appalling--that and\r\nthe relics of the frightful battle. But they had their work to do;\r\nthey had to face the facts.\r\n\r\n\"We're not children, Beta,\" said the man. \"Here we are for a purpose.\r\nThe quicker we get our work done the better. Come on, let's get busy!\"\r\n\r\nStifling the homesick feeling that tried to win upon them they set to\r\nwork. All the valuables they could recover they collected--canned\r\nsupplies, tools, instruments, weapons, ammunition and a hundred and\r\none miscellaneous articles they had formerly used.\r\n\r\nThis flotsam of a former civilization they carried down and piled in\r\nthe skin bag at the broken doorway. And darkness began to fall ere the\r\ntask was done.\r\n\r\nStill trickled the waters of the fountain in Madison Forest through\r\nthe dim evening aisles of the shattered forest. A solemn hush fell\r\nover the dead world; night was at hand.\r\n\r\n\"Come, let's be going,\" spoke the man, his voice lowered in spite of\r\nhimself, the awe of the Infinite Unknown upon him. \"We can eat in the\r\nbanca on the way. With the tide behind us, as it will be, we ought to\r\nget home by morning. And I'll be mighty glad never to see this place\r\nagain!\"\r\n\r\nHe slung a sack of cartridges over his shoulder and picked up one of\r\nthe cord loops of the bag wherein lay their treasure-trove. Beatrice\r\ntook the other.\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready,\" said she. Thus they started.\r\n\r\nAll at once she stopped short.\r\n\r\n\"Hark! What's that?\" she exclaimed under her breath.\r\n\r\nFar off to northward, plaintive, long-drawn and inexpressibly\r\nmournful, a wailing cry reechoed in the wilderness--fell, rose, died\r\naway, and left the stillness even more ghastly than before.\r\n\r\nStern stood rooted. In spite of all his aplomb and matter-of-fact\r\npracticality, he felt a strange thrill curdle through his blood, while\r\non the back of his neck the hair drew taut and stiff.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Beatrice again.\r\n\r\n\"That? Oh, some bird or other, I guess. It's nothing. Come on!\"\r\n\r\nAgain he started forward, trying to make light of the cry; but in his\r\nheart he knew it well.\r\n\r\nA thousand years before, far in the wilds near Ungava Bay, in\r\nLabrador, he had heard the same plaintive, starving call--and he\r\nremembered still the deadly peril, the long fight, the horror that had\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nHe knew the cry; and his soul quivered with the fear of it; fear not\r\nfor himself, but for the life of this girl whose keeping lay within\r\nthe hollow of his hand.\r\n\r\nFor the long wail that had trembled across the vague spaces of the\r\nforest, affronting the majesty and dignity of night and the coming\r\nstars with its blood-lusting plaint of famine, had been none other\r\nthan the summons to the hunt, the news of quarry, the signal of a\r\ngathering wolf-pack on their trail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTRAPPED!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That's not the truth you're telling me, Allan,\" said Beatrice very\r\ngravely. \"And if we don't tell each other the whole truth always, how\r\ncan we love each other perfectly and do the work we have to do? I\r\ndon't want you to spare me anything, even the most terrible things.\r\nThat's not the cry of a bird--it's wolves!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's what it is,\" the man admitted. \"I was in the wrong. But,\r\nyou see--it startled me at first. Don't be alarmed, little girl! We're\r\nwell armed you see, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we going to stay here in the tower if they attack?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. They might hold us prisoners for a week. There's no telling how\r\nmany there may be. Hundreds, perhaps thousands. Once they get the\r\nscent of game, they'll gather for miles and miles around; from all\r\nover the island. So you see--\"\r\n\r\n\"Our best plan, then, will be to make for the banca?\"\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly! It's only a matter of comparatively few minutes to reach\r\nit, and once we're aboard, we're safe. We can laugh at them and be on\r\nour homeward way at the same time. The quicker we start the better.\r\nCome on!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" she repeated. And they made their second start after Stern had\r\nassured himself his automatic hung easily in reach and that the guns\r\nwere loaded.\r\n\r\nTogether they took their way along the shadowy depths of the forest\r\nwhere once Twenty-Third Street had lain. Bravely and strongly the girl\r\nbore her half of the load as they broke through the undergrowth,\r\nclambered over fallen and rotten logs, or sank ankle-deep in mossy\r\nswales.\r\n\r\nEven though they felt the danger, perhaps at that very moment\r\nslinking, sneaking, crawling nearer off there in the vague, darkling\r\ndepths of the forest, they still sensed the splendid comradeship of\r\nthe adventure. No longer as a toy, a chattel, an instrument of\r\npleasure or amusement did the idea of woman now exist in the world. It\r\nhad altered, grown higher, nobler, purer--it had become that of mate\r\nand equal, comrade, friend, the indissoluble other half of man.\r\n\r\nBeatrice spoke.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't take more of the weight than I do, Allan,\" she insisted,\r\nas they struggled onward with their burden. \"Your wounded arm isn't\r\nstrong enough yet to--\"\r\n\r\n\"S-h-h-h!\" he cautioned. \"We've got to keep as quiet as possible. Come\r\non--the quicker we get these things aboard and push off the better!\r\nEverything depends on speed!\"\r\n\r\nBut speed was hard to make. The way seemed terribly long, now that\r\nevening had closed in and they could no longer be exactly sure of\r\ntheir path. The cumbersome burden impeded them at every step. In the\r\ngloom they stumbled, tripped over vines and creepers, and became\r\ninvolved among the close-crowding boles.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, once again the wolf-cry burst out, this time reechoed from\r\nanother and another savage throat, wailing and plaintive and full of\r\nfrightful portent.\r\n\r\nSo much nearer now it seemed that Beatrice and Allan both stopped\r\nshort. Panting with their labors, they stood still, fear-smitten.\r\n\r\n\"They can't be much farther off now than Thirty-Fifth Street,\" the man\r\nexclaimed under his breath. \"And we're hardly past Second Avenue\r\nyet--and look at the infernal thickets and brush we've got to beat\r\nthrough to reach the river! Here, I'd better get my revolver ready and\r\nhold it in my free hand. Will you change over? I can take the bag in\r\nmy left. I've got to have the right to shoot with!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not drop everything and run for the banca?\"\r\n\r\n\"And desert the job? Leave all we came for? And maybe not be able to\r\nget any of the things for Heaven knows how long? I guess not!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Allan--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! What? Abandon all our plans because of a few wolves? Let 'em\r\ncome! We'll show 'em a thing or two!\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me the revolver, then--you can have the rifle!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right--here!\"\r\n\r\nEach now with a firearm in the free hand, they started forward again.\r\nOn and on they lunged, they wallowed through the forest, half\r\ncarrying, half dragging the sack which now seemed to have grown ten\r\ntimes heavier and which at every moment caught on bushes, on limbs and\r\namong the dense undergrowth.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, look--look there!\" cried Beatrice. She stopped short again,\r\npointing the revolver, her finger on the trigger.\r\n\r\nAllan saw a lean, gray form, furtive and sneaking, slide across a dim\r\nopen space off toward the left, a space where once First Avenue had\r\ncut through the city from south to north.\r\n\r\n\"There's another!\" he whispered, a strange, choked feeling all around\r\nhis heart. \"And look--three more! They're working in ahead of us.\r\nHere, I'll have a shot at 'em, for luck!\"\r\n\r\nA howl followed the second spurt of flame in the dusk. One of the\r\ngray, gaunt portents of death licked, yapping, at his flank.\r\n\r\n\"Got you, all right!\" gibed Stern. \"The kind o' game you're after\r\nisn't as easy as you think, you devils!\"\r\n\r\nBut now from the other side, and from behind them, the slinking\r\ncreatures gathered. Their eyes glowed, gleamed, burned softly yellow\r\nthrough the dusk of the great wilderness that once had been the city's\r\nheart. The two last humans in the world could even catch the flick of\r\nivory fangs, the lolling wet redness of tongues--could hear the\r\nsoughing breath through those infernal jaws.\r\n\r\nStern raised the rifle again, then lowered it.\r\n\r\n\"No use,\" said he quite calmly. \"God knows how many there are. I might\r\nuse up all our ammunition and still leave enough of 'em to pick our\r\nbones. They'll be all around us in a minute; they'll be worrying at\r\nus, dragging us down! Come on--come on, the boat!\"\r\n\r\n\"Light a torch, Allan. They're afraid of fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grand idea, little girl!\"\r\n\r\nEven as he answered he was scrabbling up dry-kye. Came the rasp of his\r\nflint.\r\n\r\n\"Give 'em a few with the automatic, while I get this going!\" he\r\ncommanded.\r\n\r\nThe gun spat twice, thrice. Then rose a snapping, snarling wrangle.\r\nOff there in the gloom a hideous turmoil grew.\r\n\r\nIt ended in screams of pain and rage, suddenly throttled, choked, and\r\ntorn to nothing. A worrying, rending, gnashing told the story of the\r\nwounded wolf's last moment.\r\n\r\nStern sprang up, a dry flaming branch of resinous fir in his hand. The\r\nrifle he thrust back into the bag.\r\n\r\n\"Ate him, still warm, eh?\" he cried. \"Fine! And five shots left in the\r\ngun. You won't miss, Beta! You can't!\"\r\n\r\nForward they struggled once more.\r\n\r\n\"Gad, we'll hang to this bag _now_, whatever happens!\" panted Stern,\r\njerking it savagely off a jagged stub. \"Five minutes more and\r\nwe'll--arrh! _would_ you?\"\r\n\r\nThe flaring torch he dashed full at a grisly muzzle that snapped and\r\nslavered at his legs. To their nostrils the singe of burned hair\r\nwafted. Yelping, the beast swerved back.\r\n\r\nBut others ran in and in at them; and now the torch was failing. Both\r\nof them shouted and struck; and the revolver stabbed the night with\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nPandemonium rose in the forest. Cries, howls, long wails and snuffing\r\nbarks blent with the clicking of ivories, the pad-pad-pad of feet, the\r\ncrackling of the underbrush.\r\n\r\nAll around, wolves. On either side, behind, in front, the sliding,\r\nbristling, sneaking, suddenly bold horrors of the wild.\r\n\r\nAnd the ring was tightening; the attack was coming, now, more and more\r\nconcertedly. The swinging torch could not now drive them back so fast,\r\nso far.\r\n\r\nStrange gleams shot against the tree-trunks, wavered through the dusk,\r\nlighted the harsh, rage-contracted face of the man, fell on the\r\nlaboring, skin-clad figure of the woman as they still fought on and on\r\nwith their precious burden, hoping for a glimpse of water, for the\r\nriver, and salvation.\r\n\r\n\"Take--a tree?\" gasped Beatrice.\r\n\r\n\"And maybe stay there a week? And use up--all our ammunition? Not\r\nyet--no--no! The boat!\"\r\n\r\nOn, ever on, they struggled.\r\n\r\nA strange, unnatural exhilaration filled the girl, banishing thoughts\r\nof peril, sending the blood aglow through every vein and fiber of her\r\nwonderful young body.\r\n\r\nStern realized the peril more keenly. At any moment now he understood\r\nthat one of the devils in gray might hurl itself at the full throat of\r\nBeatrice or at his own.\r\n\r\nAnd once the taste of blood lay on those crimson tongues--good-by!\r\n\r\n\"The boat--the boat!\" he shouted, striking right and left like mad\r\nwith the smoky, half-extinguished flare.\r\n\r\n\"There--the river!\" suddenly cried Beatrice.\r\n\r\nThrough the columns of the forest she had seen at last the welcome\r\ngleam of water, starlit, beautiful and calm. Stern saw it, too. A\r\ndemon now, he charged the snarling ring. Back he drove them; he\r\nturned, seized the bag, and again plunged desperately ahead.\r\n\r\nTogether he and Beatrice crashed out among the willows and the alders\r\non the sedgy shore, with the vague, shifting, bristling horror of the\r\nwolf-pack at their heels.\r\n\r\n\"Here, beat 'em off while I cut the cord--while I get the bag in--and\r\nshove off!\" panted Stern.\r\n\r\nShe seized the torch from his hand. Up he snatched the rifle again,\r\nand with a pointblank volley flung three of the grays writhing and\r\nyelling all in the mud and weeds and trampled cattails on the river\r\nverge.\r\n\r\nDown he threw the gun. He turned and swept the dark shore, there\r\nbetween the ruins of the wharves, with a keen reconnoitering glance.\r\n\r\nWhat? What was this?\r\n\r\nThere stood the aged willow to which the banca had been tied. But the\r\nboat--where was it?\r\n\r\nWith a cry Stern leaped to the tree. His clutching hands fumbled at\r\nthe trunk.\r\n\r\n\"My God! Here's--here's the cord!\" he stammered. \"But it's--been cut!\r\nThe boat--_the boat's gone!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA NIGHT OF TOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour later, from the gnarled branches of the willow--up into\r\nwhich Stern had fairly flung her, and where he had himself clambered\r\nwith the beasts ravening at his legs--the two sole survivors of the\r\nhuman race watched the glowering eyes that dotted the velvet gloom.\r\n\r\n\"I estimate a couple of hundred, all told,\" judged Allan. \"Odd we\r\nnever ran across any of them before to-night. Must be some kind of a\r\nmigration under way--maybe some big shift of game, of deer, or\r\nbuffalo, or what-not. But then, in that case, they wouldn't be so\r\nstarved, so dead-set on white meat as they seem to be.\"\r\n\r\nBeta shifted her place on a horizontal limb.\r\n\r\n\"It's awfully hard for a _soft_ wood,\" she remarked. \"Do you think\r\nwe'll have to stay here long, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"That depends. I don't see that the fifteen we've killed since\r\nroosting here have served as any terrible examples to the others. And\r\nwe're about twenty cartridges to the bad. They're not worth it, these\r\ndevils. We've got to save our ammunition for something edible till I\r\ncan get my shop to running and begin making my own powder. No; must be\r\nthere's some other and better way.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what?\" asked the girl. \"We're safe enough here, but we're not\r\ngetting any nearer home--and I'm _so_ hungry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Same here,\" Stern coincided. \"And the lunch was all in the boat;\r\nworse luck! Who the deuce could have cut her loose? I thought we'd\r\npretty effectually cleared out those Hinkmatinks, or whatever the\r\nHorde consisted of. But evidently something, or somebody, is still\r\nleft alive with a terrific grudge against us, or an awful longing for\r\nnavigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the cord broken or cut?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see.\"\r\n\r\nStern clambered to a lower branch. With the trigger-guard of his rifle\r\nhe was able to catch the cord. All about the trunk, meanwhile, the\r\nwolves leaped snarling. The fetid animal smell of them was strong upon\r\nthe air--that, and the scent of blood and raw meat, where they had\r\nfeasted on the slain.\r\n\r\nWith the severed cord, Allan climbed back to where Beatrice sat.\r\n\r\n\"Hold the rifle, will you?\" asked he. A moment, and by the quick\r\nshowers of sparks that issued from his flint and steel, he was\r\nexamining the leather thong.\r\n\r\n\"_Cut!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut? But then, then--\"\r\n\r\n\"No tide or wind to blame. Some intelligence, even though rudimentary,\r\nhas been at work here--is at work--opposed to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what?\"\r\n\r\n\"No telling. There may be more things in this world yet than either of\r\nus dream. Perhaps we committed a very grave error to leave the\r\napparently peaceful little nook we've got, up there on the Hudson, and\r\ntackle this place again. But who could ever have thought of anything\r\nlike this after that terrible slaughter?\"\r\n\r\nThey kept silence a few minutes. The wolves now had sunk to a plane of\r\ncomparative insignificance. At the very worst Stern could annihilate\r\nthem, one by one, with a lavish expenditure of his ammunition.\r\nUnnoticed now, they yelped, and scratched and howled about the tree,\r\nsat on their haunches, waiting in the gloom, or sneaked--vague\r\nshadows--among the deeper dusks of the forest.\r\n\r\nAnd once again the east began to glow, even as when he and she had\r\nwatched the moon rise over the hills beyond the Hudson; and their\r\nhearts beat with joy for even that relief from the dark mystery of\r\nsolitude and night.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the man spoke.\r\n\r\n\"It's this way,\" said he. \"Whoever cut that cord and either let the\r\nbanca float away or else stole it, evidently doesn't want to come to\r\nclose quarters for the present, so long as these wolves are making\r\nthemselves friendly.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, in a way, the wolves are a factor in our favor; perhaps,\r\nwithout them, we might have had a poisoned arrow sticking into us, or\r\na spear or two, before now. My guess is that we'll get a wide berth so\r\nlong as the wolves stay in the neighborhood. I think the anthropoids,\r\nor whoever they were, must have been calculating on ambushing us as we\r\ncame back, and expected to 'get' us while we were hunting for the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\n\"They didn't reckon on this little diversion. When they heard it they\r\nprobably departed for other regions. They won't be coming around just\r\nyet, that's a safe wager. Mighty lucky, eh? Think what Ar targets we'd\r\nmake, up here in this willow, by moonlight!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Allan. But when it comes daylight we'll make better\r\nones. And I don't know that I enjoy sitting up here and starving to\r\ndeath, with a body-guard of wolves to keep away the Horde, very much\r\nmore than I would taking a chance with the arrows. It's two sixes,\r\neither way, and not a bit nice, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang the whole business! There must be some other way--some way out\r\nof this infernal pickle! Hold on--wait--I--I almost see it now!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your plan, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait! Let me think, a minute!\"\r\n\r\nShe kept silence. Together they sat among the spreading branches in\r\nthe growing moonlight. A bat reeled overhead, chippering weakly. Far\r\naway a whippoorwill began its fluty, insistent strain. A distant cry\r\nof some hunting beast echoed, unspeakably weird, among the dead,\r\ndeserted streets buried in oblivion. The brush crackled and snapped\r\nwith the movements of the wolf-pack; the continued snarling, whining,\r\nyapping, stilled the chorus of the frogs along the sedgy banks.\r\n\r\n\"If I could only snare a good, lively one!\" suddenly broke out Stern.\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, don't you see?\" And with sudden inspiration he expounded.\r\nTogether, eager as children, they planned. Beatrice clapped her hands\r\nwith sheer delight.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" she added pensively, \"it'll be a little hard on the wolf, won't\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nStern had to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he assented; \"but think how much he'll learn about the new kind\r\nof game he tried to hunt!\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later a grim old warrior of the pack, deftly and securely\r\ncaught by one hind leg with the slip-noosed leather cord, dangled\r\ninverted from a limb, high out of reach of the others.\r\n\r\nSlowly he swung, jerking, writhing, frothing as he fought in vain to\r\nsnap his jaws upon the cord he could not touch. And night grew\r\nhorrible with the stridor of his yells.\r\n\r\n\"Now then,\" remarked Stern calmly, \"to work. The moonlight's good\r\nenough to shoot by. No reason I should miss a single target.\"\r\n\r\nFollowed a time of frightful tumult as the living ate the dying and\r\nthe dead, worrying the flesh from bones that had as yet scarcely\r\nceased to move. Beatrice, pale and silent, yet very calm, watched the\r\nslaughter. Stern, as quietly methodical as though working out a\r\nreaction, sighted, fired, sighted, fired. And the work went on apace.\r\nThe bag of cartridges grew steadily lighter. The work was done long\r\nbefore all the wolves had died. For the survivors, gorged to\r\nrepletion, some wounded, others whole, slunk gradually away and\r\ndisappeared in the dim glades, there to sleep off their cannibal\r\ndebauch.\r\n\r\nAt last Stern judged the time was come to descend.\r\n\r\n\"Bark away, old boy!\" he exclaimed. \"The louder the better. You're our\r\ndanger-signal now. As long as those poor, dull anthropoid brains keep\r\nsensing you I guess we're safe!\"\r\n\r\nTo Beatrice he added:\r\n\r\n\"Come now, dear. I'll help you down. The quicker we tackle that raft\r\nand away, the sooner we'll be home!\"\r\n\r\n\"Home!\" she repeated. \"Oh, how glad I'll be to see our bungalow again!\r\nHow I hate the ruins of the city now! Look out, Allan--you'll have to\r\nlet me take a minute or two to straighten out in. You don't know how\r\nawfully cramped I am!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just slide into my arms--there, that's right!\" he answered, and swung\r\nher down as easily as though she had been a child. Her arms went round\r\nhis neck; their lips met and thrilled in a long kiss.\r\n\r\nBut not even the night-breeze and the moon could now beguile them to\r\nanother. For there was hard, desperate work to do, and time was short.\r\n\r\nA moment they stood there together, under the old tree wherein the\r\nwolf was dangling in loud-mouthed rage.\r\n\r\n\"Well, here's where I go at it!\" exclaimed the man.\r\n\r\nHe opened the big sack. Fumbling among the tools, he quickly found the\r\nax.\r\n\r\n\"You, Beta,\" he directed, \"get together all the plaited rope you can\r\ntake off the bag, and cut me some strips of hide. Cut a lot of them.\r\nI'll need all you can make. We've got to work fast--got to clear out\r\nof here before sunrise or there may be the devil to pay!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a labor of extraordinary difficulty, there in those dense and\r\ndim-lit thickets, felling a tall spruce, limbing it out and cutting it\r\ninto three sections. But Stern attacked it like a demon. Now and again\r\nhe stopped to listen or to jab tile suspended wolf with the ax-handle.\r\n\r\n\"Go on there, you alarm-signal!\" he commanded. \"Let's have plenty of\r\nmusic, good and loud, too. Maybe if you deliver the goods and hold\r\nout--well, you'll get away with your life. Otherwise, not!\"\r\n\r\nRobinson Crusoe's raft had been a mere nothing to build compared with\r\nthis one that the engineer had to construct there at the water's edge,\r\namong the sedges and the reeds For Crusoe had planks and beams and\r\nnails to help him; while Stern had naught but his ax, the forest, and\r\nsome rough cordage.\r\n\r\nHe had to labor in the gloom, as well, listening betimes for sounds of\r\nperil or stopping to stimulate the wolf. The dull and rusty ax\r\nretarded him; blisters rose upon his palms, and broke, and formed\r\nagain. But still he toiled.\r\n\r\nThe three longitudinal spruce timbers he lashed together with poles\r\nand with the cords that Beatrice prepared for him. On these, again, he\r\nlaid and lashed still other poles, rough-hewn.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour's hard work, while the moon began to sink to the\r\nwestward, he had stepped a crude mast and hewed a couple of\r\npunt-poles.\r\n\r\n\"No use our trying to row this monstrosity,\" he said to Beatrice,\r\nstopping a moment to dash the sweat off his forehead with a shaking\r\nhand. \"We either rig the skin sack in some way as a sail, or we drift\r\nup with the tide, tie at the ebb, and so on--and if we make the\r\nbungalow in three days we're lucky!\r\n\r\n\"Come on now, Beatrice. Lend a hand here and we'll launch her! Good\r\nthing the tide's coming up--she almost floats already. Now, one, two,\r\nthree!\"\r\n\r\nThe absurd raft yielded, moved, slid out upon the marshy water and was\r\nafloat!\r\n\r\n\"Get aboard!\" commanded Allan. \"Go forward to the _salon de luxe_.\r\nI'll stow the bag aft, so.\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted her in his arms and set her on the raft. The bag he\r\ncarefully deposited at what passed for the stern. The raft sank a bit\r\nand wallowed, but bore up.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, all aboard!\" cried Stern.\r\n\r\n\"The wolf, Allan, the wolf! How about _him?_\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, I almost plumb forgot! I guess he's earned his life,\r\nall right enough.\"\r\n\r\nQuickly he slashed the cord. The wolf dropped limp, tried to crawl,\r\nbut could not, and lay panting on its side, tongue lolling, eyes\r\nglazed and dim.\r\n\r\n\"He'll be a horrible example all his life of what it means to monkey\r\nwith the new kind of meat,\" remarked Allan, clambering aboard. \"If\r\nwolves or anthropoids can learn, they ought to learn from him!\"\r\n\r\nStrongly, steadily, they poled the raft out through the marshy slip,\r\non, on, past the crumbling wreckage of the pier-head.\r\n\r\n\"Now the tide's got us,\" exclaimed Allan with satisfaction, as the\r\nmoonlit current, all silver and rippling with calm beauty, swung them\r\nup-stream.\r\n\r\nBeatrice, still strong, and full of vigorous, pulsing life, in spite\r\nof the long vigil in the tree and the hard night of work, curled up at\r\nthe foot of the rough mast, on the mass of fir-tips Stern had piled\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\"You steer, boy,\" said she, \"and I'll go to work on making some kind\r\nof sail out of the big skin. By morning we ought to have our little\r\ncraft under full control.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's one beautiful boat, isn't it?\" mocked Stern, poling off from a\r\ngaunt hulk that barred the way.\r\n\r\n\"It mayn't be very beautiful,\" she answered softly, \"but it carries\r\nthe greatest, purest, noblest love that ever was since the world\r\nbegan--it carries the hope of the whole world, of all the ages--and\r\nit's taking us home!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE REBIRTH OF CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\n\r\nA month had hardly gone, before order and peace and the promise\r\nof bountiful harvests dwelt in and all about Hope Lodge, as they had\r\nnamed the bungalow.\r\n\r\nFrom the kitchen, where the stove and the aluminum utensils now shone\r\nbright and free from rust, to the bedrooms where fir-tips and soft\r\nskin rugs made wondrous sleeping places, the house was clean and sweet\r\nand beautiful again. Rough-hewn chairs and tables, strong, serviceable\r\nand eloquent of nature--through which this rebirth of the race all had\r\nto come--adorned the rooms. Fur rugs covered the floors.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of pictures, masses of flowers and great sprays of foliage\r\nstood in clay pots of Stern's own manufacture and firing. And on a\r\nrustic book-case in their living room, where the big fireplace was,\r\nand where the southern sun beat warmest in, stood their chief\r\ntreasure--a set of encyclopedias.\r\n\r\nStern had made leather bindings for these, with the deft help of\r\nBeatrice. The original bindings had vanished before the attacks of\r\ntime and insects centuries before. But the leaves were still intact.\r\nFor these were thin sheets of nickel, printed by the electrolysis\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\"Just a sheer streak of luck,\" Stern remarked, as he stood looking at\r\nthis huge piece of fortune with the girl. \"Just a kindly freak of\r\nfate, that Van Amburg should have bought one of Edison's first sets of\r\nnickel-sheet books.\r\n\r\n\"Except for the few sets of these in existence, here and there, not a\r\nbook remains on the surface of this entire earth. The finest hand-made\r\nlinen paper has disintegrated ages ago. And parchment has probably\r\ncrinkled and molded past all recognition. Besides, up-to-date\r\nscientific books, such as we need, weren't done on parchment. We're\r\nplaying into gorgeous luck with these cyclopedias, for everything I\r\nneed and can't remember is in them. But it certainly was one job to\r\nsort those scattered sheets out of the rubbish-pile in the library and\r\nrearrange them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that _was_ hard work, but it's done now. Come on out into the\r\ngarden, Allan, and see if our crops have grown any during the night!\"\r\n\r\nThe grounds about the bungalow were a delight to them. Like two\r\nchildren they worked, day by day, to enlarge and beautify their\r\nholdings, their lands won back from nature's greed.\r\n\r\nThough wild fruits--some new, others familiar--and fish and the\r\nplentiful game all about them offered abundant food, to be had for the\r\nmere seeking, they both agreed on the necessity of reestablishing\r\nagriculture. For they disliked the thought of being driven southward,\r\nwith the return of each successive winter. They wanted, if advisable,\r\nto be able to winter in the bungalow. And this meant some provision\r\nfor the unproductive season.\r\n\r\n\"It won't always be summer here, you know,\" Stern told her. \"This Eden\r\nwill sometime lie wet and dreary under the winter rains that I expect\r\nnow take the place of snow. And the eternal curse of Adam--toil--is\r\nnot yet lifted even from us two survivors of the fifteen hundred\r\nmillion that once ruled the earth. We, and those who shall come after,\r\nmust have the old-time foods again. And that means work!\"\r\n\r\nThey had cleared a patch of black, virgin soil, in a sunny hollow.\r\nHere Stern had transplanted all the wild descendants of the vegetables\r\nand grains of other time which in his still limited explorations he\r\nhad come across.\r\n\r\nThe work of clearing away the thorns and bushes, the tangled lianas\r\nand tall trees, was severe; but it strengthened him and hardened his\r\nwhip-cord muscles till they ridged his skin like iron. He burned and\r\npulled the stumps, spaded and harrowed and hoed all by hand, and made\r\nready the earth for the reception of its first crop in a thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nHe recalled enough of his anthropology and botany from university days\r\nto recognize the reverted, twisted and stringy little degenerate\r\nwild-potato root which had once served the Aztecs and Pueblo Indians\r\nfor food, and could again, with proper cultivation, be brought back to\r\nfull perfection. Likewise with the maize, the squash, the wild turnip,\r\nand many other vegetable forms.\r\n\r\n\"Three years of cultivation,\" he declared, \"and I can win them back to\r\nedibility. Five, and they'll be almost where they were before the\r\ngreat catastrophe. As for the fruits, the apple, cherry, and pear, all\r\nthey need is care and scientific grafting.\r\n\r\n\"I predict that ten years from to-day, orchards and cornfields and\r\ngardens shall surround this bungalow, and the heritage of man shall be\r\nbrought back to this old world!\"\r\n\r\n\"Always giving due credit to the encyclopedia,\" added Beatrice.\r\n\r\n\"And to _you!_\" he laughed happily. \"This is all on your account,\r\nanyhow. If I were alone in the world, you bet there'd be no gardens\r\nmade!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't believe there would,\" she agreed, a serious look on her\r\nface. \"But, then,\" she concluded, smiling again, \"you aren't alone,\r\nAllan. You've got _me!_\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to catch her in his arms, but she evaded him and ran back\r\ntoward the bungalow.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, you've got to work,\" she called to him from the porch. \"And\r\nso have I. Good-by!\" And with a wave of the hand, a strong, brown hand\r\nnow, slim and very beautiful, she vanished.\r\n\r\nStern stood in thought a moment, then shook his head, and, with a\r\nsingular expression, picked up his hoe, and once more fell to\r\ncultivating his precious little garden-patch, on which so infinitely\r\nmuch depended. But something lay upon his mind; he paused, reflecting;\r\nthen picked up a stone and weighed it in his hand, tried another, and\r\na third.\r\n\r\n\"I'm damned,\" he remarked, \"if these feel right to met I've been\r\nwondering about it for a week now--there's got to be some answer to\r\nit. A stone of this size in the old days would certainly have weighed\r\nmore. And that big boulder I rooted out from the middle of the\r\nfield--in the other days I couldn't have more than stirred it.\r\n\r\n\"Am I so very much stronger? So much as all that? Or have things grown\r\nlighter? Is that why I can leap farther, walk better, run faster?\r\nWhat's it all about, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\nHe could not work, but sat down on a rock to ponder. Numerous\r\nphenomena occurred to him, as they had while he had lain wounded under\r\nthe tree by the river during their first few days at the bungalow.\r\n\r\n\"My observations certainly show a day only twenty-two hours and\r\nfifty-seven minutes long; that's certain,\" he mused. \"So the earth is\r\nundoubtedly smaller. But what's that got to do with the mass of the\r\nearth? With weight? Hanged if I can make it out at all!\r\n\r\n\"Even though the earth has shrunk, it ought to have the same power of\r\ngravitation. If all the molecules and atoms really were pressed\r\ntogether, with no space between, probably the earth wouldn't be much\r\nbigger than a football, but it would weigh just that much, and a body\r\nwould fall toward it from space just as fast as now. Quite a hefty\r\nfootball, eh? For the life of me I can't see why the earth's having\r\nshrunk has affected the weight of everything!\"\r\n\r\nPerplexed, he went back to his work again. And though he tried to\r\nbanish the puzzle from his mind it still continued to haunt and to\r\nannoy him.\r\n\r\nEach day brought new and interesting activities. Now they made an\r\nexpedition to gather a certain kind of reeds which Beatrice could plat\r\ninto cordage and basketry; now they peeled quantities of birch-bark,\r\nwhich on rainy days they occupied themselves in splitting into thin\r\nsheets for paper. Stern manufactured a very excellent ink in his\r\nimprovised laboratory on the second floor, and the split and pointed\r\nquills of a wild goose served them for pens in taking notes and\r\nrecording their experiences.\r\n\r\n\"Paper will come later, when we've got things a little more settled,\"\r\nhe told her. \"But for now this will have to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess if you can get along with skin clothing for a while, I can do\r\nwith birch-bark for my correspondence,\" she replied laughing. \"Why not\r\ncatch some of those wild sheep that seem so plentiful on the hills to\r\nwestward? If we could domesticate them, that would mean wool and yarn\r\nand cloth--and milk, too, wouldn't it? And if milk, why not butter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so fast!\" he interposed. \"Just wait a while--we'll have cattle,\r\ngoats, and sheep, and the whole business in due time; but how much can\r\none pair of human beings undertake? For the present we'll have to be\r\ncontent with what mutton-chops and steaks and hams I can get with a\r\ngun--and we're mighty lucky to have those!\"\r\n\r\nSingularly enough, and contrary to all beliefs, they felt no need of\r\nsalt. Evidently the natural salts in their meat and in the fruits they\r\nate supplied their wants. And this was fortunate, because the quest of\r\nsalt might have been difficult; they might even had had to boil\r\nsea-water to obtain it.\r\n\r\nThey felt no craving for sweets, either; but when one day they came\r\nupon a bee-tree about three-quarters of a mile back in the woods to\r\nwestward of the river, and when Stern smoked out the bees and gathered\r\nfive pounds of honey in the closely platted rush basket lined with\r\nleaves, which they always carried for miscellaneous treasure-trove,\r\nthey found the flavor delicious. They decided to add honey to their\r\nmenu, and thereafter always kept it in a big pottery jar in their\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\nStern's hunting, fishing and gardening did not occupy his whole time.\r\nEvery day he made it a rule to work at least an hour, two if possible,\r\non the thirty-foot yawl that had already begun to take satisfactory\r\nshape on the timber ways which now stood on the river bank.\r\n\r\nAll through July and part of August he labored on this boat, building\r\nit stanch and true, calking it thoroughly, fitting a cabin, stepping a\r\nfir mast, and making all ready for the great migration which he felt\r\nmust inevitably be forced upon them by the arrival of cool weather.\r\n\r\nHe doubted very much, in view of the semitropic character of some of\r\nthe foliage, whether even in January the temperature would now go\r\nbelow freezing; but in any event he foresaw that there would be no\r\nfruits available, and he objected to a winter on flesh foods. In\r\npreparation for the trip he had built a little \"smoke-house\" near the\r\nbeach, and here he smoked considerable quantities of meat--deer-meat,\r\nbeef from a wild steer which he was so fortunate as to shoot during\r\nthe third week of their stay at the bungalow, and a good score of hams\r\nfrom the wild pigs which rooted now and then among the beech growth\r\nhalf a mile downstream.\r\n\r\nOften the girl and he discussed this coming trip, of an evening,\r\nsitting together by the river to watch the stars and moon and that\r\nstrange black wandering blotch that now and then obscured a portion of\r\nthe night sky--or perchance leaning back in their huge, rustic easy\r\nchairs lined with furs on the broad piazza; or again, if the night\r\nwere cool or rainy, in front of their blazing fire of pine knots and\r\ndriftwood, which burned with gorgeous blues and greens and crimsons in\r\nthe vast throat of Hope Lodge fireplace.\r\n\r\nOther matters, too, they talked of--strange speculations, impossible\r\nto solve, yet filling them with vague uneasiness, with wonder and a\r\nkind of mighty awe in face of the vast, unknowable mysteries\r\nsurrounding them; the forces and phenomena which might, though\r\nfriendly in their outward aspect, at any time precipitate catastrophe,\r\nruin and death upon them and extinguish in their persons all hopes of\r\na world reborn.\r\n\r\nThe haunting thought was never very far away: \"Should either one of us\r\nbe killed--what then?\"\r\n\r\nOne day Stern voiced his fear.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice,\" he said, \"if anything should ever happen to me, and you be\r\nleft alone in a world which, without me, would become instantly\r\nhostile and impossible, remember that the most scientific way out is a\r\nbullet. That's _my_ way if anything happens to _you!_ Understand?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded, and for a long time that day the silence of a great pact\r\nweighed upon their souls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPLANNING THE GREAT MIGRATION\r\n\r\n\r\nStern rigged a tripod for the powerful field-glasses he had\r\nrescued from the Metropolitan Building, and by an ingenious addition\r\nof a wooden tube and another lens carefully ground out of rock\r\ncrystal, succeeded in producing (on the right-hand barrel of the\r\nbinoculars) a telescope of reasonably high power. With this, of an\r\nevening, he often made long observations, after which he would spend\r\nhours figuring all over many sheets of the birch bark, which he then\r\ncarefully saved and bound up with leather strings for future\r\nreference.\r\n\r\nIn Van's set of encyclopedias he found a fairly large celestial map\r\nand thorough astronomic data. The results of his computations were of\r\nvital interest to him.\r\n\r\nHe said to Beatrice one evening:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, that wandering black patch in the sky moves in a regular\r\norbit of its own? It's a solid body, dark, irregular in outline, and\r\ncertainly not over five hundred miles above the surface of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can it be, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know yet. It puzzles me tremendously. Now, if it would only\r\nappear in the daytime once in a while, we might be able to get some\r\ninformation or knowledge about it; but, coming only at night, all it\r\nrecords itself as is just a black, moving thing. I'm working on the\r\nsize of it now, making some careful studies. In a while I shall\r\nprobably know its area and mass and density. But what it is I cannot\r\nsay--not yet.\"\r\n\r\nThey both pondered a while, absorbed in wonder. At last the engineer\r\nspoke again.\r\n\r\n\"Beta,\" said he, \"there's another curious fact to note. The axis of\r\nthe earth itself has shifted more than six degrees, thirty minutes!\"\r\n\r\n\"It has? Well--what about it?\" And she went on with her platting of\r\nreed cordage.\r\n\r\n\"You don't seem much concerned about it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not. Not in the least. It can shift all it wants to, for all of\r\nme. What hurt does it do? Doesn't it run just as well that way?\"\r\n\r\nStern looked at her a moment, then laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; it runs all right,\" he answered. \"Only I thought the\r\nannouncement that the pole-star had thrown up its job might startle\r\nyou a bit. But I see it doesn't. So far as practical results go, it\r\naccounts for the warmer climate and the decreased inclination to the\r\nplane of the ecliptic; or, rather, the decreased--\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, please, don't!\" she begged. \"There's nothing really wrong, is\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that depends on how you define it. Probably an astronomer might\r\nthink there was something very much wrong. I make it that the orbit of\r\nthe earth has altered its relative length and width by--\"\r\n\r\n\"No figures, Allan, there's a dear. You know I'm awfully bad at\r\narithmetic. Tell me what it means, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it means, for one thing, that we've maybe spent a far longer\r\ntime on this earth since the cataclysm than we even dare suspect. It\r\nmay be that what we've been calculating as about a thousand years, is\r\ntwice that, or even five times that--no telling. For another thing,\r\nI'm convinced by all these changes, and by the diminution of gravity\r\nand by the accelerated rate of revolution of the earth--\"\r\n\r\n\"Allan dear, please hand me those scissors, won't you?\"\r\n\r\nStern laughed again.\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" said he. \"I guess I'm not much good as a lecturer. But I tell\r\nyou one thing I'm going to do, and that's a one best bet. I'm going to\r\nhave a try at some really big telescope before a year's out, and know\r\nthe truth of this thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"A big telescope! Build one, you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily. All I need is a chance to make some accurate\r\nobservations, and I can find out all I need to know. Even though I\r\nhave been out of college for--let's see--\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifteen hundred years, at a guess,\" she suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, all of that. Even so, I remember a good bit of astronomy. And\r\nI've got my mind set on peeking through a first-class tube. If the\r\nearth has broken in two, or anything like that, and our part is\r\nskyhooting away toward the unknown regions of outer space beyond the\r\ngreat ring of the Milky Way and is getting into an unchartered place\r\nin the universe--as it seems to be--why, we ought to have a good look\r\nat things. We ought to know what's what, eh?\r\n\r\n\"Then there's the moon I want to investigate, too. No living man\r\nexcept myself has even seen the side that's now turned toward the\r\nearth. No telling what a good glass mightn't show.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so, dear,\" she answered. \"But where can you find the sort of\r\ntelescope you need?\"\r\n\r\n\"In Boston--in Cambridge, rather. The Harvard observatory has the\r\nbiggest one within striking distance. What do you say to our making\r\nour trial trip in the boat, up the Sound and around Cape Cod, to\r\nBoston? We can spend a week there, then slant away for wherever we may\r\ndecide to pass the winter. How does that suit you, Beta?\"\r\n\r\nShe put away her work, and for a moment sat looking in at the flames\r\nthat went leaping up the huge boulder chimney. The room glowed with\r\nwarmth and light that drove away the cheerlessness of a foggy, late\r\nAugust drizzle.\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think we're wise to--to leave our home, with winter\r\ncoming on?\" she asked at length, pensively, the firelight casting its\r\nglow across her cheek and glinting in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Wise? Yes. We can't stay here, that's certain. And what is there to\r\nfear out in the world? With our firearms and our knowledge of fire\r\nitself, our science and our human intelligence, we're far more than a\r\nmatch for all enemies, whether of the beast-world or of that race of\r\nthe Horde. I hate, in a way, to revisit the ruins of New York, for\r\nmore ammunition and canned stuffs. The place is to o ghastly, too\r\nhideous, now, after the big fight.\r\n\r\n\"Boston will be a clean ground for us, with infinite resources. And as\r\nI said before, there's the Cambridge observatory. It's only two or\r\nthree miles back in the forest, from the coast; maybe not more than\r\nhalf a mile from some part of the Charles River. We can sail up, camp\r\non Soldiers' Field, and visit it easily. Why not?\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the tiger-rug before the fire, near the girl. She drew\r\nhis head down into her lap; then, when he was lying comfortably, began\r\nplaying with his thick hair, as he loved so well to have her do.\r\n\r\n\"If you think it's all right, Allan,\" said she, \"we'll go. I want what\r\nyou want.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my good girl!\" exclaimed the engineer. \"We'll be ready to\r\nstart in a few days now. The boat's next thing to finished. What with\r\nthe breadfruit, smoked steer and buffalo meat, hams and canned goods\r\nnow on our shelves, we've certainly got enough supplies to stock her a\r\ntwo months' trip.\r\n\r\n\"Even with less, we'd be safe in starting. You see, the world's lain\r\nuntouched by mankind for so many centuries that all the blighting\r\neffect of man's folly and greed and general piracy has vanished.\r\n\r\n\"The soil's got back to its natural state, animal life abounds, and so\r\nlong as I still have a good supply of cartridges, we can live almost\r\nanywhere. Anthropoids? I don't think there's much danger. Oh, yes, I\r\nremember the line of blue smoke we saw yesterday over the hills to\r\nwestward; but what does that prove? Lightning may have started a\r\nfire--there's no telling. And we can't always stay here, Beta, just\r\nbecause there may be dangers out yonder!\"\r\n\r\nHe flung one arm toward the vast night, beyond the panes where the\r\nmist and storm were beating cheerlessly.\r\n\r\n\"No, we can't camp down here indefinitely. Now's the time to start. As\r\nI say, we've got all of sixty days' of downright civilized food on\r\nhand, for a good cruise in the Adventure. The chance of finding other\r\npeople somewhere is too precious not to make any risk worth while.\"\r\n\r\nSilence fell between them for a few minutes. Each saw visions in the\r\nflames. The man's thoughts dwelt, in particular, on this main factor\r\nof a possible rediscovery of other human beings somewhere.\r\n\r\nMore than the girl, he realized the prime importance of this\r\npossibility. Though he and she loved each other very dearly, though\r\nthey were all in all each to the other, yet he comprehended the\r\nloneliness she felt rather than analyzed--the infinite need of man for\r\nman, of woman for woman--the old social, group-instinct of the race\r\nbeginning to reassert itself even in their Eden.\r\n\r\nEach of them longed, with a longing they hardly realized as yet, to\r\nhear some other human voice, to see another face, clasp another hand\r\nand again feel the comradeship of man.\r\n\r\nDuring the past week or so, Stern had more than once caught himself\r\nlistening for some other sound of human life and activity. Once he had\r\nfound the girl standing on a wooded point among the pines, shading her\r\neyes with her hand and watching down-stream with an attitude of hope\r\nwhich spoke more fluently than words. He had stolen quietly away,\r\nsaying nothing, careful not to break her mood. For he had understood\r\nit; it had been his very own.\r\n\r\nThe mood expressed itself, at times, in long talks together of the\r\nseeming dream-age when there had been so many millions of men and\r\nwomen in the world. Beatrice and Stern found themselves dwelling with\r\na peculiar pleasure on memories and descriptions of throngs.\r\n\r\nThey would read the population statistics in Van's encyclopedia, and\r\nwonder greatly at them, for now these figures seemed the unreal\r\nchimeras of wild imaginings.\r\n\r\nThey would talk of the crowded streets, the \"L\" crushes and the jams\r\nat the Bridge entrance; of packed cars and trains and overflowing\r\ntheaters; of great concourses they had seen; of every kind and\r\ncondition of affairs where thousands of their kind had once rubbed\r\nelbows, all strangers to each other, yet all one vast kin and family\r\nready in case of need to succor one another, to use the collective\r\nintelligence for the benefit of each.\r\n\r\nSometimes they indulged in fanciful comparisons, trying to make their\r\npresent state seem wholly blest.\r\n\r\n\"This is a pretty fine way to live, after all,\" Stern said one day,\r\n\"even if it is a bit lonesome at times. There's no getting up in the\r\nmorning and rushing to an office. It's a perpetual vacation! There are\r\nno appointments to keeps no angry clients kicking because I can't make\r\nwater run up-hill or make cast-iron do the work of tool-steel. No\r\nsaloons or free-lunches, no subways to stifle the breath out of us, no\r\nbills to pay and no bill collectors to dodge; no laws except the laws\r\nof nature, and such as we make ourselves; no bores and no bad shows;\r\nno politics, no yellow journals, no styles--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear, how I'd like to see a milliner's window again!\" cried\r\nBeatrice, rudely shattering his thin-spun tissue of optimism. \"These\r\nskin-clothes, all the time, and no hats, and no chiffons and no--no\r\nnothing, at all--! Oh, I never half appreciated things till they were\r\nall taken away!\"\r\n\r\nStern, feeling that he had tapped the wrong vein, discreetly withdrew;\r\nand the sound of his calking-hammer from the beach, told that he was\r\nexpending a certain irritation on the hull of the Adventure.\r\n\r\nOne day he found a relic that seemed to stab him to the heart with a\r\nsudden realization of the tremendous gap between his own life and that\r\nwhich he had left.\r\n\r\nHunting in the forest, to westward of the bungalow, he came upon what\r\nat first glance seemed a very long, straight, level Indian mound or\r\nearthwork; but in a moment his trained eye told him it was a railway\r\nembankment.\r\n\r\nWith an almost childish eagerness he hunted for some trace of the\r\ntrack; and when, buried under earth-mold and rubbish, he found some\r\nrotten splinters of metal, they filled him with mingled pleasure and\r\ndepression.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" he exclaimed, \"is it possible that here, right where I\r\nstand, countless thousands of human beings once passed at tremendous\r\nvelocity, bent on business and on pleasure, now ages long vanished and\r\nmeaningless and void? That mighty engines whirled along this bank,\r\nwhere now the forest has been crowding for centuries? That all, all\r\nhas perished--forever?\r\n\r\n\"It shall not be!\" he cried hotly, and flung his hands out in\r\npassionate denial. \"All shall be thus again! All shall return--only\r\nfar better! The world's death shall not, cannot be!\"\r\n\r\nExperiences such as these, leaving both of them increasingly irritated\r\nand depressed as time went on, convinced Stern of the imperative\r\nnecessity for exploration. If human beings still existed anywhere in\r\nthe world, he and she must find them, even at the risk of losing life\r\nitself. Years of migration, he felt, would not be too high a price to\r\npay for the reward of coming once again in contact with his own\r\nspecies. The innate gregariousness of man was torturing them both.\r\n\r\nNow that the hour of departure was drawing nigh, a strange exultation\r\nfilled them both--the spirit of conquest and of victory.\r\n\r\nTogether they planned the last details of the trip.\r\n\r\n\"Is the sail coming along all right, Beta?\" asked Stern, the night\r\nwhen they decided to visit Cambridge. \"You expect to have it done in a\r\nday or two?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can finish it to-morrow. It's all woven now. Just as soon as I\r\nfinish binding one edge with leather strips, it'll be ready for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right; then we can get a good, early start, on Monday morning.\r\nNow for the details of the freight.\"\r\n\r\nThey worked out everything to its last minutiae. Nothing was\r\nforgotten, from ammunition to the soap which Stern had made out of\r\nmoose-fat and wood-ashes and had pressed into cakes; from\r\nfishing-tackle and canned goods to toothbrushes made of stiff\r\nvegetable fibers set in bone; from provisions even to a plentiful\r\nsupply of birch-bark leaves for taking notes.\r\n\r\n\"Monday morning we're off,\" Stern concluded, \"and it will be the\r\ngrandest lark two people ever had since time began! Built and stocked\r\nas the Adventure is, she's safe enough for anything from here to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\"Name the place you want to see, and it's yours. Florida? Bermuda?\r\nMediterranean? With the compass I've made and adjusted to the new\r\nmagnetic variations, and with the maps out of Van's set of books, I\r\nreckon we're good for anything, including a trip around the world.\r\n\r\n\"The survivors will be surprised to see a fully stocked yawl putting\r\nin to rescue them from savagery, eh? Imagine doing the Captain Cook\r\nstunt, with white people for subjects!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I'm not counting on their treating us the way Captain Cook\r\nwas; are you? And what if we shouldn't find anybody, dear? What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we help finding people? Could a billion and a half human\r\nbeings die, all at once, without leaving a single isolated group\r\nsomewhere or other?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you never succeeded in reaching them with the wireless from the\r\nMetropolitan, Allan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind--they weren't in a condition to pick up my messages;\r\nthat's all. We surely must find somebody in all the big cities we can\r\nreach by water, either along He coast or by running up the Mississippi\r\nor along the St. Lawrence and through the lakes. There's Boston, of\r\ncourse, and Philadelphia, New Orleans, San Francisco, St. Louis,\r\nChicago--dozens of others--no end of places!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if they're only not all like New York!\"\r\n\r\n\"That remains to be seen. There's all of Europe, too, and Africa and\r\nAsia--why, the whole wide world is ours! We're so rich, girl, that it\r\nstaggers the imagination--we're the richest people that have ever\r\nlived, you and I. The 'pluses' in the old days owned their millions;\r\nbut we own--we own the whole earth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if there's anybody else alive, dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so. Well, I'll be glad to share it with 'em, for the sake of a\r\nhandshake and a 'howdy,' and a chance to start things going again. Do\r\nyou know, I rather count on finding a few scattered remnants of folk\r\nin London, or Paris, or Berlin?\r\n\r\n\"Just the same as in our day, a handful of ragged shepherds descended\r\nfrom the Mesopotamian peoples extinct save for them--were tending\r\ntheir sheep at Kunyunjik, on those Babylonian ruins where once a\r\nmighty metropolis stood, and where five million people lived and\r\nmoved, trafficked, loved, hated, fought, conquered, died--so now\r\nto-day, perhaps, we may run across a handful of white savages\r\ncrouching in caves or rude huts among the debris of the Place de\r\nl'Opera, or Unter den Linden, or--\"\r\n\r\n\"And civilize them, Allan? And bring them back and start a colony and\r\nmake the world again? Oh, Allan, do you think we could?\" she\r\nexclaimed, her eyes sparkling with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"My plans include nothing less,\" he answered. \"It's mighty well worth\r\ntrying for, at any rate. Monday morning we start, then, little girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, if you say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impatient, now?\" he laughed. \"No, Monday will be time enough. Lots of\r\nthings yet to put in shape before we leave. And we'll have to trust\r\nour precious crops to luck, at that. Here's hoping the winter will\r\nbring nothing worse than rain. There's no help for it, whatever\r\nhappens. The larger venture calls us.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat there discussing many many other factors of the case, for a\r\nlong time. The fire burned low, fell together and dwindled to glowing\r\nembers on the hearth.\r\n\r\nIn the red gloom Allan felt her vague, warm, beautiful presence.\r\nStrong was she; vigorous, rosy as an Amazon, with the spirit and the\r\nbeauty of the great outdoors; the life lived as a part of nature's own\r\nself. He realized that never had a woman lived like her.\r\n\r\nDimly he saw her face, so sweet, so gentle in its wistful strength,\r\nshadowed with the hope and dreams of a whole race--the type, the\r\nsymbol, of the eternal motherhood.\r\n\r\nAnd from his hair he drew her hand down to his mouth and kissed it;\r\nand with a thrill of sudden tenderness blent with passion he knew all\r\nthat she meant to him--this perfect woman, his love, who sometime soon\r\nwas now to be his bride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTOWARD THE GREAT CATARACT\r\n\r\n\r\nPleasant and warm shone the sun that Monday morning, the 2d of\r\nSeptember, warm through the greenery of oak and pine and fern-tree.\r\nGolden it lay upon the brakes and mosses by the river-bank; silver\r\nupon the sands.\r\n\r\nSave for the chippering of the busy squirrels, a hush brooded over\r\nnature. The birds were silent. A far blue haze veiled the distant\r\nreaches of the stream. Over the world a vague, premonitory something\r\nhad fallen; it was summer still, but the first touch of dissolution,\r\nof decay, had laid the shadow of a pall upon it.\r\n\r\nAnd the two lovers felt their hearts gladden at thought of the long\r\nmigration out into the unknown, the migration that might lead them to\r\nsouthern shores and to perpetual plenty, perhaps to the great boon of\r\ncontact once again with humankind.\r\n\r\nFrom room to room they went, making all tight and fast for the long\r\nabsence, taking farewell of all the treasures that during their long\r\nweeks of occupancy had accumulated there about them.\r\n\r\nThough Stern was no sentimentalist, yet he, too, felt the tears well\r\nin his eyes, even as Beta did, when they locked the door and slowly\r\nwent down the broad steps to the walk he had cleared to the river.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by,\" said the girl simply, and kissed her hand to the bungalow.\r\nThen he drew his arm about her and together they went on down the\r\npath. Very sweet the thickets of bright blossoms were; very warm and\r\nsafe the little garden looked, cut out there from the forest that\r\nstood guard about it on all sides.\r\n\r\nThey lingered one last moment by the sun-dial he had carved on a flat\r\nboulder, set in a little grassy lawn. The shadow of the gnomon fell\r\nathwart the IX and touched the inscription he had graved about the\r\nedge:\r\n\r\n  I MARK NO HOURS BUT BRIGHT ONES.\r\n\r\nBeatrice pondered.\r\n\r\n\"We've never had any other kind, together--not one,\" said she, looking\r\nup quickly at the man as though with a new sort of self-realization.\r\n\"Do you know that, dear? In all this time, never one hour, never one\r\nsingle moment of unhappiness or disagreement. Never a harsh word, an\r\nunkind look or thought. 'No hours but bright ones!' Why, Allan, that's\r\nthe motto of our lives!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of our lives,\" he repeated gravely. \"Our lives, forever, as long\r\nas we live. But come, come--time's slipping on. See, the shadow's\r\nmoving ahead already. Come, say good-by to everything, dear, until\r\nnext spring. Now let's be off and away!\"\r\n\r\nThey went aboard the yawl, which, fully laden, now lay at a little\r\nstone wharf by the edge of the sweet wild wood, its mast overhung by\r\narching branches of a Gothic elm.\r\n\r\nAllan cast off the painter of braided leather, and with his boat-hook\r\npushed away. He poled out into the current, then raised the sail of\r\nwoven rushes like that of a Chinese junk.\r\n\r\nThe brisk north wind caught it, the sail crackled, filled and bellied\r\nhugely. He hauled it tight. A pleasant ripple began to murmur at the\r\nstern as the yawl gathered speed.\r\n\r\n\"Boston and way-stations!\" cried he. But through his jest a certain\r\nsadness seemed to vibrate. As the wooded point swallowed up their\r\nbungalow and blotted out all sight of their garden in the wilderness,\r\nthen as the little wharf vanished, and nothing now remained but\r\nmemories, he, too, felt the solemnity of a leave-taking which might\r\nwell be eternal.\r\n\r\nBeatrice pressed a spray of golden-rod to her lips.\r\n\r\n\"From our garden,\" said she. \"I'm going to keep it, wherever we go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" he answered. \"But this is no time, now, for\r\nretrospection. Everything's sunshine, life, hope--we've got a world to\r\nwin!\"\r\n\r\nThen as the yawl heeled to the breeze and foamed away down stream with\r\na speed and ease that bore witness to the correctness of her lines, he\r\nstruck up a song, and Beatrice joined in, and so their sadness\r\nvanished and a great, strong, confident joy thrilled both of them at\r\nprospect of what was yet to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy mid-afternoon they had safely navigated\r\nHarlem River and the upper reaches of East River, and were well up\r\ntoward Willett's Point, with Long Island Sound opening out before them\r\nbroadly.\r\n\r\nOf the towns and villages, the estates and magnificent palaces that\r\nonce had adorned the shores of the Sound, no trace remained. Nothing\r\nwas visible but unbroken lines of tall, blue forest in the distance;\r\nthe Sound appeared to have grown far wider, and what seemed like a\r\nstrong current set eastward in a manner certainly not produced by the\r\ntide, all of which puzzled Stern as he held the little yawl to her\r\ncourse, sole alone in that vast blue where once uncounted thousands of\r\nkeels had vexed the brine.\r\n\r\nNightfall found them abreast the ruins of Stamford, still holding a\r\nfair course about five or six miles off shore.\r\n\r\nSave for the gulls and one or two quick-scurrying flights of Mother\r\nCarey's chickens (now larger and swifter than in the old days), and a\r\nsingle \"V\" of noisy geese, no life had appeared all that afternoon.\r\nStern wondered at this. A kind of desolation seemed to lie over the\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\"Ten times more living things in our vicinity back home on the\r\nHudson,\" he remarked to Beatrice, who now lay 'midships, under the\r\nshelter of the cabin, warmly wrapped in furs against the keen cutting\r\nof the night wind. \"It seems as though something had happened around\r\nhere, doesn't it? I should have thought the Sound would be alive with\r\nbirds and fish. What can the matter be?\"\r\n\r\nShe had no hypothesis, and though they talked it over, they reached no\r\nconclusion. By eight o'clock she fell asleep in her warm nest, and\r\nStern steered on alone, by the stars, under promise to put into harbor\r\nwhere New Haven once had stood, and there himself get some much-needed\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nSwiftly the yawl split the waters of the Sound, for though her sail\r\nwas crude, her body was as fine and speedy as his long experience with\r\nboats could make it. Something of the vast mystery of night and sea\r\npenetrated his soul as he held the boat on her way.\r\n\r\nThe night was moonless; only the great untroubled stars wondered down\r\nat this daring venture into the unknown.\r\n\r\nStern hummed a tune to keep his spirits up. Running easily over the\r\nmonotonous dark swells with a fair following breeze, he passed an hour\r\nor two. He sat down, braced the tiller, and resigned himself to\r\ncontemplation of the mysteries that had been and that still must be.\r\nAnd very sweet to him was the sense of protection, of guardianship,\r\nwherein he held the sleeping girl, in the shelter of the little cabin.\r\n\r\nHe must have dozed, sitting there inactive and alone. How long? He\r\ncould not tell. All that he knew was, suddenly, that he had wakened to\r\nfull consciousness, and that a sense of uneasiness, of fear, of peril,\r\nhung about him.\r\n\r\nUp he started, with an exclamation which he suppressed just in time to\r\navoid waking Beatrice. Through all, over all, a vast, dull roar was\r\nmaking itself heard--a sound as though of mighty waters rushing,\r\nleaping, echoing to the sky that droned the echo back again.\r\n\r\nWhence came it? Stern could not tell. From nowhere, from everywhere;\r\nthe hum and vibrant blur of that tremendous sound seemed universal.\r\n\r\n\"My God, what's that?\" Allan exclaimed, peering ahead with eyes\r\nwidened by a sudden stabbing fear. \"I've got Beatrice aboard, here; I\r\ncan't let anything happen to her!\"\r\n\r\nThe gibbous moon, red and sullen, was just beginning to thrust its\r\nstrangely mottled face above the uneasy moving plain of waters. Far\r\noff to southward a dim headland showed; even as Stern looked it\r\ndrifted backward and away.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he got a terrifying sense of speed. The headland must have\r\nlain five miles to south of him; yet in a few moments, even as he\r\nwatched, it had gone into the vague obliteration of a vastly greater\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\"What's happening?\" thought Stern. The wind had died; it seemed as\r\nthough the waters were moving with the wind, as fast as the wind; the\r\nyawl was keeping pace with it, even as a floating balloon drifts in a\r\nstorm, unfeeling it.\r\n\r\nDeep, dull, booming, ominous, the roar continued. The sail flapped\r\nidle on the mast. Stern could distinguish a long line of foam that\r\nslid away, past the boat, as only foam slides on a swift current.\r\n\r\nHe peered, in the gloom, to port; and all at once, far on the horizon,\r\nsaw a thing that stopped his heart a moment, then thrashed it into\r\nfurious activity.\r\n\r\nOff there in a direction he judged as almost due northeast, a tenuous,\r\nrising veil of vapor blotted out the lesser stars and dimmed the\r\nbrighter ones.\r\n\r\nEven in that imperfect light he could see something of the sinuous\r\ndrift of that strange cloud.\r\n\r\nQuickly he lashed the tiller, crept forward and climbed the mast, his\r\nnight-glasses slung over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nHolding by one hand, he tried to concentrate his vision through the\r\nglasses, but they failed to show him even as much as the naked eye\r\ncould discern.\r\n\r\nThe sight was paralyzing in its omen of destruction. Only too well\r\nStern realized the meaning of the swift, strong current, the roar--now\r\never increasing, ever deepening in volume--the high and shifting vapor\r\nveil that climbed toward the dim zenith.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Heaven!\" gulped he. \"There's a cataract over there--a\r\nterrible chasm--a plunge--to what? And we're drifting toward it at\r\nexpress-train speed!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE PLUNGE!\r\n\r\n\r\nDazed though Stern was at his first realization of the\r\nimpending horror, yet through his fear for Beatrice, still asleep\r\namong her furs, struggled a vast wonder at the meaning, the\r\npossibility of such a phenomenon.\r\n\r\nHow could a current like that rush up along the Sound? How could there\r\nbe a cataract, sucking down the waters of the sea itself--whither\r\ncould it fall? Even at that crisis the man's scientific curiosity was\r\naroused; he felt, subconsciously, the interest of the trained observer\r\nthere in the midst of deadly peril.\r\n\r\nBut the moment demanded action.\r\n\r\nQuickly Stern dropped to the deck, and, noiseless as a cat in his\r\ndoe-skin sandals, ran aft.\r\n\r\nBut even before he had executed the instinctive tactic of shifting the\r\nhelm, paying off, and trying to beat up into the faint breeze that now\r\ndrifted over the swirling current, he realized its futility and\r\nabandoned it.\r\n\r\n\"No use,\" thought he. \"About as effective as trying to dip up the\r\nocean with a spoon. Any use to try the sweeps? Maybe she and I\r\ntogether could swing away out of the current--make the shore--nothing\r\nelse to do--I'll try it, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nBeside the girl he knelt.\r\n\r\n\"Beta! Beta!\" he whispered in her ear. He shook her gently by the arm.\r\n\"Come, wake up, girlie--there's work to do here!\"\r\n\r\nShe, submerged in healthy sleep, sighed deeply and murmured some\r\nunintelligible thing; but Stern persisted. And in a minute or so there\r\nshe was, sitting up in the bottom of the yawl among the furs.\r\n\r\nIn the dim moonlight her face seemed a vague sweet flower shadowed by\r\nthe dark, wind-blown masses of her hair. Stern felt the warmth,\r\nscented the perfume of her firm, full-blooded flesh. She put a hand to\r\nher hair; her tiger-skin robe, falling back to the shoulder, revealed\r\nher white and beautiful arm.\r\n\r\nAll at once she drew that arm about the man and brought him close to\r\nher breast.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Allan!\" she breathed. \"My boy! Where are we? What is it? Oh, I\r\nwas sleeping so soundly! Have we reached harbor yet? What's that\r\nnoise--that roaring sound? Surf?\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment he could not answer. She, sensing some trouble, peered\r\nclosely at him.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Allan?\" cried she, her woman's intuition telling her of\r\ntrouble. \"Tell me--is anything wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, dearest!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, what?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're in some kind of--of--\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it may be. I don't know yet. But there's something wrong. You\r\nsee--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Allan!\" she exclaimed, and started up. \"Why didn't you waken me\r\nbefore? What is it? What can I do to help?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think there's rough water ahead, dear,\" the engineer answered,\r\ntrying to steady his voice, which shook a trifle in spite of him. \"At\r\nany rate, it sounds like a waterfall of some kind or other; and see,\r\nthere's a line, a drift of vapor rising over there. We're being\r\ncarried toward it on a strong current.\"\r\n\r\nAnxiously she peered, now full awake. Then she turned to Allan.\r\n\r\n\"Can't we sail away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not enough wind. We might possibly row out of the current, and--and\r\nperhaps--\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me one of the sweeps quick, quick!\"\r\n\r\nHe put the sweeps out. No sooner had he braced himself against a rib\r\nof the yawl and thrown his muscles against the heavy bar than she,\r\ntoo, was pulling hard.\r\n\r\n\"Not too strong at first, dear,\" he cautioned. \"Don't use up all your\r\nstrength in the first few minutes. We may have a long fight for it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm in it with you--till the end--whichever way it ends,\" she\r\nanswered; and in the moonlight he saw the untrammeled swing and play\r\nof her magnificent body.\r\n\r\nThe yawl came round slowly till it was crosswise to the current,\r\nheaded toward the mainland shore. Now it began to make a little\r\nheadway. But the breeze slightly impeded it.\r\n\r\nStern whipped out his knife and slashed the sheets of platted rush.\r\nThe sail crumpled, crackled and slid down; and now under a bare pole\r\nthe boat cradled slowly ahead transversely across the foam-streaked\r\ncurrent that ran swiftly soughing toward the dim vapor-swirls away to\r\nthe northeast.\r\n\r\nNo word was spoken now. Both Beatrice and Stern lay to the sweeps;\r\nboth braced themselves and put the full force of back and arms into\r\neach long, powerful stroke. Yet Stern could see that, at the rate of\r\nprogress they were making over that black and oily swirl, they could\r\nnot gain ten feet while the current was carrying them a thousand.\r\n\r\nIn his heart he knew the futility of the fight, yet still he fought.\r\nStill Beatrice fought for life, too, there by his side. Human\r\ninstinct, the will to live, drove them on, on, where both understood\r\nthere was no hope.\r\n\r\nFor now already the current had quickened still more. The breeze had\r\nsprung up from the opposite direction; Stern knew the boiling rush of\r\nwaters had already reached a speed greater than that of the wind\r\nitself. No longer the stars trembled, reflected, in the waters. All\r\nugly, frothing, broken, the swift current foamed and leaped, in long,\r\nhorrible gulfs and crests of sickening velocity.\r\n\r\nAnd whirlpools now began to form. The yawl was twisted like a straw,\r\nwrenched, hurled, flung about with sickening violence.\r\n\r\n\"Row! _Row!_\" Stern cried none the less. And his muscles bunched and\r\nhardened with the labor; his veins stood out, and sweat dropped from\r\nhis brow, ran into his eyes, and all but blinded him.\r\n\r\nThe girl, too, was laboring with all her might. Stern heard her\r\nbreath, gasping and quick, above the roar and swash of the mad waters.\r\nAnd all at once revulsion seized him--rage, and a kind of mad\r\nexultation, a defiance of it all.\r\n\r\nHe dropped the sweep and sprang to her.\r\n\r\n\"Beta!\" he shouted, louder than the droning tumult. \"No use! No use at\r\nall! Here--come to me!\"\r\n\r\nHe drew the sweep inboard and flung it in the bottom of the yawl.\r\n\r\nAlready the vapors of the cataract ahead were drifting over them and\r\ndriving in their faces. A vibrant booming shuddered through the dark\r\nair, where now even the moon's faint light was all extinguished by the\r\nwhirling mists.\r\n\r\nHeaven and sea shook with the terrible concussion of falling waters.\r\nThough Stern had shouted, yet the girl could not have heard him now.\r\n\r\nIn the gloom he peered at her; he took her in his arms. Her face was\r\npale, but very calm. She showed no more fear than the man; each seemed\r\ninspired with some strange exultant thought of death, there with the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nHe drew her to his breast and covered her face; he knelt with her\r\namong the heaped-up furs, and then, as the yawl plunged more violently\r\nstill, they sank down in the poor shelter of the cabin and waited.\r\n\r\nHis arms were about her; her face was buried on his breast. He\r\nsmoothed her hair; his lips pressed her forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by!\" he whispered, though she could not hear.\r\n\r\nThey seemed now to hover on the very brink.\r\n\r\nA long, racing sluicelike incline of black waters, streaked with\r\nswirls of white, appeared before them. The boat plunged and whirled,\r\ndipped, righted, and sped on.\r\n\r\nBehind, a huge, rushing, wall-like mass of lathering, leaping surges.\r\nIn front, a vast nothingness, a black, unfathomable void, up through\r\nwhich gushed in clouds the mighty jets of vapor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCame a lurch, a swift plunge.\r\n\r\nThe boat hung suspended a moment.\r\n\r\nStern saw what seemed a long, clear, greenish slant of water. Deafened\r\nand dazed by the infernal pandemonium of noise, he bowed his head on\r\nhers, and his arms tightened.\r\n\r\nSuddenly everything dropped away. The universe crashed and bellowed.\r\n\r\nStern felt a heavy dash of brine--cold, strangling, irresistible.\r\n\r\nAll grew black.\r\n\r\n\"_Death!_\" thought he, and knew no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTRAPPED ON THE LEDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nConsciousness won back to Allan Stern--how long afterward he\r\ncould not tell--under the guise of a vast roaring tumult, a deafening\r\nthunder that rose, fell, leaped aloft again in huge, titanic cadences\r\nof sound.\r\n\r\nAnd coupled with this glimmering sense-impression, he felt the drive\r\nof water over him; he saw, vaguely as in the memory of a dream, a dim\r\ngray light that weakly filtered through the gloom.\r\n\r\nWeak, sick, dazed, the man realized that he still lived; and to his\r\nmind the thought \"Beatrice!\" flashed back again.\r\n\r\nWith a tremendous effort, gasping and shaken, weak, unnerved and\r\nwounded, he managed to raise himself upon one elbow and to peer about\r\nhim with wild eyes.\r\n\r\nA strange scene that. Even in the half light, with all his senses\r\ndistorted by confusion and by pain, he made shift to comprehend a\r\nlittle of what he saw.\r\n\r\nHe understood that, by some fluke of fate, life still remained in him;\r\nthat, in some way he never could discover, he had been cast upon a\r\nledge of rock there in the cataract--a ledge over which spray and foam\r\nhurled, seething, yet a ledge which, parting the gigantic flood,\r\noffered a chance of temporary safety.\r\n\r\nAbove him, sweeping in a vast smooth torrent of clear green, he saw\r\nthe steady downpour of the falls. Out at either side, as he lay there\r\nstill unable to rise, he caught glimpses through the spume-drive,\r\nglimpses of swift white water, that broke and creamed as it whirled\r\npast; that jetted high; that, hissing, swept away, away, to unknown\r\ndepths below that narrow, slippery ledge.\r\n\r\nRealization of all this had hardly forced itself upon his dazed\r\nperceptions when a stronger recrudescence of his thought about the\r\ngirl surged back upon him.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! Beatrice!\" he gasped, and struggled up.\r\n\r\nOn hands and knees, groping, half-blinded, deafened, he began to\r\ncrawl; and as he crawled, he shouted the girl's name, but the\r\nthundering of the vast tourbillions and eddies that swirled about the\r\nrock, white and ravening, drowned his voice. Vague yet terrible, in\r\nthe light of the dim moon that filtered through the mists, the racing\r\nflood howled past. And in Stern's heart, as he now came to more and\r\nbetter understanding, a vast despair took shape, a sickening fear\r\nsurged up.\r\n\r\nAgain he shouted, chokingly, creeping along the slippery ledge.\r\nThrough the driving mists he peered with agonized eyes. Where was the\r\nyawl now? Where the girl? Down there in that insane welter of the mad\r\ntorrent--swept away long since to annihilation? The thought maddened\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nClutching a projection of the rock, he hauled himself up to his feet,\r\nand for a moment stood there, swaying, a strange, tattered, dripping\r\nfigure in the dim moonlight, wounded, breathless and disheveled, with\r\nbloodshot eyes that sought to pierce the hissing spray.\r\n\r\nAll at once he gulped some unintelligible thing and staggered forward.\r\n\r\nThere, wedged in a crevice, he had caught sight of something--what it\r\nwas he could not tell, but toward it now he stumbled.\r\n\r\nHe reached the thing. Sobbing with realization of his incalculable\r\nloss and of the wreckage of all their hopes and plans and all that\r\nlife had meant, he fell upon his knees beside the object.\r\n\r\nHe groped about it as though blind; he felt that formless mass of\r\ndebris, a few shattered planks and part of the woven sail, now jammed\r\ninto the fissure in the ledge. And at touch of all that remained to\r\nhim, he crouched there, ghastly pale and racked with unspeakable\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\nBut hope and the indomitable spirit of the human heart still urged him\r\non. The further end of the ledge, overdashed with wild jets of spray\r\nand stinging drives of brine, still remained unexplored. And toward\r\nthis now he crept, bit by bit, fighting his way along, now clinging as\r\nsome more savage surge leaped over, now battling forward on hands and\r\nknees along the perilous strip of stone.\r\n\r\nOne false move, he knew, one slip and all was over. He, too, like the\r\nyawl itself, and perhaps like Beatrice, would whirl and fling away\r\ndown, down, into the nameless nothingness of that abyss.\r\n\r\nBetter thus, he dimly realized, better, after all, than to cling to\r\nthe ledge in case he could not find her. For it must be only a matter\r\nof time, and no very long time at that, when exhaustion and starvation\r\nwould weaken him and when he must inevitably be swept away.\r\n\r\nAnd in his mind he knew the future, which voiced itself in a\r\nhalf-spoken groan:\r\n\r\n\"If she's not there, or if she's there, but dead--good-by!\"\r\n\r\nEven as he sensed the truth he found her. Sheltered behind a jutting\r\nspur of granite, Beatrice was lying, where the shock of the impact had\r\nthrown her when the yawl had struck the ledge.\r\n\r\nDrenched and draggled in her water-soaked tiger-skin, her long hair\r\ntangled and disheveled over the rock, she lay as though asleep.\r\n\r\n\"_Dead!_\" gasped Allan, and caught her in his arms, all limp and cold.\r\nBack from her brow he flung the brine-soaked hair; he kissed her\r\nforehead and her lips, and with trembling hands began to chafe her\r\nface, her throat, her arms.\r\n\r\nTo her breast he laid his ear, listening for some flicker of life,\r\nsome promise of vitality again.\r\n\r\nAnd as he sensed a slight yet rhythmic pulsing there--as he detected a\r\nfaint breath, so vast a gratitude and love engulfed him that for a\r\nmoment all grew dazed and shaken and unreal.\r\n\r\nHe had to brace himself, to struggle for self-mastery.\r\n\r\n\"Beta! Beta!\" he cried. \"Oh, my God! You live--you live!\"\r\n\r\nDripping water, unconscious, lithe, she lay within his clasp, now\r\nstrong again. Forgotten his weakness and his pain, his bruises, his\r\nwounds, his fears All had vanished from his consciousness with the one\r\nsupreme realization--\"_She lives!_\"\r\n\r\nBack along the ledge he bore her, not slipping now, not crouching, but\r\nerect and bold and powerful, nerved to that effort and that daring by\r\nthe urge of the great love that flamed through all his veins.\r\n\r\nBack he bore her to the comparative safety of the other end, where\r\nonly an occasional breaker creamed across the rock and where, behind a\r\nnarrow shelf that projected diagonally upward and outward, he laid his\r\nprecious burden down.\r\n\r\nAnd now again he called her name; he rubbed and chafed her.\r\n\r\nOnly joy filled his soul. Nothing else mattered now. The total loss of\r\ntheir yawl and all its precious contents, the wreck of their\r\nexpedition almost at its very start, the fact that Beatrice and he\r\nwere now alone upon a narrow ledge of granite in the midst of a\r\nstupendous cataract that drained the ocean down to unknown,\r\nunthinkable depths, the knowledge that she and he now were without\r\narms, ammunition, food, shelter, fire, anything at all, defenseless in\r\na wilderness such as no humans ever yet had faced--all this meant\r\nnothing to Allan Stern.\r\n\r\nFor he had _her_; and as at last her lids twitched, then opened, and\r\nher dazed eyes looked at him; as she tried to struggle up while he\r\nrestrained her; as she chokingly called his name and stretched a\r\ntremulous hand to him, there in the thunderous half light of the\r\nfalls, he knew he could not ask for greater joy, though all of\r\ncivilization and of power might be his, without her.\r\n\r\nIn his own soul he knew he would choose this abandonment and all this\r\ndesperate peril with Beatrice, rather than safety, comfort, luxury,\r\nand the whole world as it once had been apart from her.\r\n\r\nYet, as sometimes happens in the supreme crises of life, his first\r\nspoken word was commonplace enough.\r\n\r\n\"There, there, lie still!\" he commanded, drawing her close to his\r\nbreast. \"You're all right, now--just keep quiet, Beatrice!\"\r\n\r\n\"What--what's happened--\" she gasped. \"_Where_--\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a little accident, that's all,\" he soothed the frightened girl.\r\nDazed by the roaring cadence of the torrent, she shuddered and hid her\r\nface against him; and his arms protected her as he crouched there\r\nbeside her in the scant shelter of the rocky shelf.\r\n\r\n\"We got carried over a waterfall, or something of that sort,\" he\r\nadded. \"We're on a ledge in the river, or whatever it is, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"You're hurt, Allan?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no--are _you?_\"\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing, boy!\" She looked up again, and even in the dim light he\r\nsaw her try to smile. \"Nothing matters so long as we have each other!\"\r\n\r\nSilence between them for a moment, while he drew her close and kissed\r\nher. He questioned her again, but found that save for bruises and a\r\ncruel blow on the temple, she had taken no hurt in the plunge that had\r\nstunned her. Both, they must have been flung from the yawl when it had\r\ngone to pieces. How long they had lain upon the rock they knew not.\r\nAll they could know was that the light woodwork of the boat had been\r\ndashed away with their supplies and that now they again faced the\r\nworld empty-handed--provided even that escape were possible from the\r\nmidst of that mad torrent.\r\n\r\nAn hour or so they huddled in the shelter of the rocky shelf till\r\nstrength and some degree of calm returned and till the growing light\r\nfar off to eastward through the haze and mist told them that day was\r\ndawning again.\r\n\r\nThen Allan set to work exploring once more carefully their little\r\nislet in the swirling flood.\r\n\r\n\"You stay here, Beta,\" said he. \"So long as you keep back of this\r\nprojection you're safe. I'm going to see just what the prospect is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, be careful, Allan!\" she entreated. \"Be so very, very careful,\r\nwon't you?\"\r\n\r\nHe promised and left her. Then, cautiously, step by step, he made his\r\nway along the ledge in the other direction from that where he had\r\nfound the senseless girl.\r\n\r\nTo the very end of the ledge he penetrated, but found no hope. Nothing\r\nwas to be seen through the mists save the mad foam-rush of the waters\r\nthat leaped and bounded like white-maned horses in a race of death.\r\nBold as the man was, he dared not look for long. Dizziness threatened\r\nto overwhelm him with sickening lure, its invitation to the plunge.\r\nSo, realizing that nothing was to be gained by staying there, he drew\r\nback and once more sought Beatrice.\r\n\r\n\"Any way out?\" she asked him, anxiously, her voice sounding clear and\r\npure through the tumult of the rushing waters.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, despairingly. And silence fell again, and each sat\r\nthinking long, long thoughts, and dawn came creeping grayly through\r\nthe spume-drive of the giant falls.\r\n\r\nMore than an hour must have passed before Stern noted a strange\r\nphenomenon--an hour in which they had said few words--an hour in which\r\nboth had abandoned hopes of life--and in which, she in her own way, he\r\nin his, they had reconciled themselves to the inevitable.\r\n\r\nBut at last, \"What's that?\" exclaimed the man; for now a different\r\ntone resounded in the cataract, a louder, angrier note, as though the\r\nplunge of waters at the bottom had in some strange, mysterious way\r\ndrawn nearer. \"What's that?\" he asked again.\r\n\r\nBelow there somewhere by the tenebrous light of morning he could\r\nsee--or thought that he could see--a green, dim, vaguely tossing drive\r\nof waters that now vanished in the whirling mists, now showed again\r\nand now again grew hidden.\r\n\r\nOut to the edge of the rocky shelf he crept once more. Yes, for a\r\ncertainty, now he could make out the seething plunge of the waters as\r\nthey roared into the foam-lashed flood below.\r\n\r\nBut how could this be? Stern's wonder sought to grasp analysis of the\r\nstrange phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\"If it's true that the water at the bottom's rising,\" thought he,\r\n\"then there must either be some kind of tide in that body of water or\r\nelse the cavity itself must be filling up. In either case, what if the\r\nprocess continues?\"\r\n\r\nAnd instantly a new fear smote him--a fear wherein lay buried like a\r\nfly in amber a hope for life, the only hope that had yet come to him\r\nsince his awakening there in that trap sealed round by sluicing\r\nmaelstroms.\r\n\r\nHe watched a few moments longer, then with a fresh resolve, desperate\r\nyet joyful in its strength, once more sought the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Beta,\" said he, \"how brave are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"How brave? Why, dear?\"\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, then replied: \"Because, if what I believe is true,\r\nin a few minutes you and I have got to make a fight for life--a harder\r\nfight than any we've made yet--a fight that may last for hours and\r\nmay, after all, end only in death. A battle royal! Are you strong for\r\nit? Are you brave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Try me!\" she answered, and their eyes met, and he knew the truth,\r\nthat come what might of life or death, of loss or gain, defeat or\r\nvictory, this woman was to be his mate and equal to the end.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, then!\" he commanded. \"This is our last, our only chance. And\r\nif it fails--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nON THE CREST OF THE MAELSTROM\r\n\r\n\r\nStern's observation of the rising flood proved correct. By\r\nwhatever theory it might or might not be explained, the fact was\r\npositive that now the water there below them was rising fast, and that\r\ninside of half an hour at the outside the torrent would engulf their\r\nledge.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though there must be some vast, rhythmic ebb and flux in\r\nthe unsounded abysses that yawned beneath them, some incalculable\r\nregurgitation of the sea, which periodically spewed forth a part, at\r\nleast, of the enormous torrent that for hours poured into that titanic\r\ngulf.\r\n\r\nAnd it was upon this flux, stormy and wild and full of seething\r\nwhirlpools, that Allan Stern and the girl now built their only\r\npossible hope of salvation and of life.\r\n\r\n\"Come, we must be at work!\" he told her, as together they peered over\r\nthe edge and now beheld the weltering flood creeping up, up along the\r\nthunderous plunge of the waterfall till it was within no more than a\r\nhundred feet of their shelter.\r\n\r\nAs the depth of the fall decreased the spray-drive lessened, and now,\r\nwith the full coming of day, some reflection of the golden morning sky\r\ncrept through the spray. Yet neither to right nor left could they see\r\nshore or anything save that long, swift, sliding wall of brine,\r\nfoam-tossed and terrible.\r\n\r\n\"To work!\" said he again. \"If we're going to save ourselves out of\r\nthis inferno we've got to make some kind of preparation. We can't just\r\nswim and trust to luck. We shall have to malice float of some sort or\r\nother, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but what with?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"With what remains of the yawl!\"\r\n\r\nAnd even as he spoke he led the way to the crevice where the\r\nsplintered boards and the torn sail had been wedged fast.\r\n\r\n\"A slim hope, I know,\" he admitted, \"but it's all we've got now.\"\r\n\r\nDriven home as the wreckage was by the terrific impact of the blow,\r\nStern had a man's work cut out for him to get it clear; but his was as\r\nthe strength of ten, and before half an hour had passed he had, with\r\nthe girl's help, freed all the planks and laid them out along the\r\nrock-shelf, the most sheltered spot of the ledge.\r\n\r\nAnother hour later the planks had been lashed into a rough sort of\r\nfloat with what cordage remained and with platted strips of the mat\r\nsail.\r\n\r\n\"It's not half big enough to hold us up altogether,\" judged the man,\r\n\"but if we merely use it to keep our heads out of water it will serve,\r\nand it's got the merit of being unsinkable, anyhow. God knows how long\r\nwe may have to be in the water, little girl. But whatever comes we've\r\ngot to face it. There's no other chance at all!\"\r\n\r\nThey waited now calmly, with the resignation of those who have no\r\nalternative to hardship. And steadily the flood mounted up, up, toward\r\nthe ledge, and now the seethe was very near. Now already the leaping\r\nfroth of the plunge was dashing up against their rock. In a few\r\nmoments the shelter would be submerged.\r\n\r\nHe put his lips close to her ear, for now his voice could not carry.\r\n\r\n\"Let's jump for it!\" he cried. \"If we wait till the flood reaches us\r\nhere we'll be crushed against the rock. Come on, Beatrice, we've got\r\nto plunge!\"\r\n\r\nShe answered with her eyes; he knew the girl was ready. To him he drew\r\nher and their kiss was one that spoke eternal farewell. But of this\r\nthought no word passed their lips.\r\n\r\n\"_Come!_\" bade the man once more.\r\n\r\nHow they leaped into that vortex of mad waters, how they vanished in\r\nthat thunderous welter, rose, sank, fought, strangled, rose again and\r\ncaught the air, and once more were whirled down and buried in that\r\ncrushing avalanche; how they clung to the lashed planks and with these\r\nspiraled in mad sarabands among the whirlpools and green eddies; how\r\nthey were flung out into smoother water, blinded and deafened, yet\r\nwith still the spark of life and consciousness within them, and how\r\nthey let the frail raft bear them, fainting and dazed, all their\r\nsenses concentrated just on gripping this support--all this they never\r\ncould have told.\r\n\r\nStern knew at last, with something of clarity, that he was floating\r\neasily along an oily current which ran, undulating, beneath a\r\nslate-gray mist; he realized that with one hand he was grasping the\r\nplanks, with the other arm upbearing the girl.\r\n\r\nPale and with closed eyes, she lay there in the hollow of his arm, her\r\nface free from water, her long hair floating out upon the tide.\r\n\r\nHe saw her lids twitch and knew she lived. Yet even as he thanked God\r\nand took a firmer hold on her, consciousness lapsed again, and with it\r\nall realization of time or of events.\r\n\r\nYet though the moments--or were they hours?--which followed left no\r\nimpress on his brain, some intelligence must have directed Stern. For\r\nwhen once more he knew, he found the mist and fog all gone; he saw a\r\ngolden sun that weltered all across the heaving flood in a brave\r\nsplendor; and, off to northward, a wooded line of hills, blue in the\r\ndistance, yet beautiful with their promise of salvation.\r\n\r\nStern understood, then, what must have happened. He saw that the\r\nupfilling of the abyss, whatever might have caused it, had flung them\r\nforth; he perceived that the temporary flood which had taken place\r\nbefore once more another terrific down-draft should pour into the\r\ngaping chasm, had cast them out, floated by their raft of planks, even\r\nas match-straws might be flung and floated on the outburst of a\r\ngeyser.\r\n\r\nHe understood; he knew that, fortune favoring, life still beckoned\r\nthere ahead.\r\n\r\nAnd in his heart resolve leaped up.\r\n\r\n\"Life! Life!\" he cried. \"Oh, Beatrice, look! See! There's land ahead,\r\nthere--_land!_\"\r\n\r\nBut the girl, still circled by his arm, lay senseless. Allan knew he\r\ncould make no progress in that manner. So by dint of great labor, he\r\nmanaged to draw her somewhat onto the float and there to lash her with\r\na loose end of cordage in such wise that she could breathe with no\r\ndanger of drowning.\r\n\r\nHimself he summoned all his forces, and now began to swim through the\r\nsmooth tides, which, warm with some grateful heat, vastly unlike the\r\nusual ocean chill, stretched lazily rolling away and away to that far\r\noff shore.\r\n\r\nThat day was long and bitter, an agony of toil, hope, despair, labor\r\nand struggle, and the girl, reviving, shared it toward the end. Only\r\ntheir frail raft fenced death away, but so long as the buoyant planks\r\nheld together they could not drown.\r\n\r\nThirst and exhaustion tortured them, but there was no hope of appeal\r\nto any help. In this manless world there could be no rescue. Here,\r\nthere, a few gulls wheeled and screamed above the flood; and once a\r\nschool of porpoises, glistening as they curved their shining backs in\r\nlong leaps through the brine, played past. Allan and the girl envied\r\nthe creatures, and renewed their fight for life.\r\n\r\nThe south wind favored, and what seemed a landward current drew them\r\non. Their own strength, too, in spite of the long fast and the\r\nincredible hardships, held out well. For now that civilization was a\r\nthing of the oblivious past, they shared the vital forces and the very\r\npowers of Mother Nature herself. And, like two favored children of\r\nthat all-mother, they slowly made their way to land.\r\n\r\nNight found them utterly exhausted and soaked to the marrow, yet\r\nalive, stretched out at full length, inert, upon the warm sands of a\r\nvirgin beach. There they lay, supine, above high tide, whither they\r\nhad dragged themselves with terrible exertion. And the stars wheeled\r\noverhead; and down upon them the strange-featured moon wondered with\r\nher pallid gleam.\r\n\r\nFireless, foodless and without shelter, unprotected in every way,\r\npossessing nothing now save just their own bodies and the draggled\r\ngarments that they wore, they lay and slept. In their supreme\r\nexhaustion they risked attack from wild beasts and from anthropoids.\r\nSleep to them was now the one vital, inevitable necessity.\r\n\r\nThus the long night hours passed and strength revived in them,\r\nup-welling like fresh tides of life; and once more a new day grayed\r\nthe east, then transmuted to bright gold and blazoned its insignia all\r\nup the eastern sky.\r\n\r\nStern woke first, dazed with the long sleep, toward mid-morning. A\r\nlittle while he lay as though adream, trying to realize what had\r\nhappened; but soon remembrance knitted up the fabric of the peril and\r\nthe close escape. And, arising stiffly from the sand, he stretched his\r\nsplendid muscles, rubbed his eyes, and stared about him.\r\n\r\nA burning thirst was tormenting him. His tongue clave to the roof of\r\nhis mouth; he found, by trial, that he could scarcely swallow.\r\n\r\n\"Water!\" gasped he, and peered at the deep green woods, which promised\r\nabundant brooks and streams.\r\n\r\nBut before he started on that quest he looked to see that Beatrice was\r\nsafe and sound. The girl still slept. Bending above her he made sure\r\nthat she was resting easily and that she had taken no harm. But the\r\nsun, he saw, was shining in her face.\r\n\r\n\"That won't do at all!\" he thought; and now with a double motive he\r\nstrode off up the beach, toward the dense forest that grew down to the\r\nline of shifting sands.\r\n\r\nTen minutes and he had discovered a spring that bubbled out beneath a\r\nmoss-hung rock, a spring whereof he drank till renewed life ran\r\nthrough his vigorous body. And after that he sought and found with no\r\ngreat labor a tree of the same species of breadfruit that grew all\r\nabout their bungalow on the Hudson.\r\n\r\nThen, bearing branches of fruit, and a huge, fronded tuft of the giant\r\nfern-trees that abounded there, he came back down the beach to the\r\nsleeping girl, who still lay unconscious in her tiger-skin, her heavy\r\nhair spread drying on the sands, her face buried in the warm, soft\r\nhollow of her arm.\r\n\r\nHe thrust the stalk of the fern-tree branch far down into the sand,\r\nbending it so that the thick leaves shaded her. He ate plentifully of\r\nthe fruit and left much for her. Then he knelt and kissed her forehead\r\nlightly, and with a smile upon his lips set off along the beach.\r\n\r\nA rocky point that rose boldly against the morning, a quarter-mile to\r\nsouthward, was his objective.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever's to be seen round here can be seen from there,\" said he.\r\n\"I've got _my_ job cut out for me, all right--here we are, stranded,\r\nwithout a thing to serve us, no tools, weapons or implements or\r\nsupplies of any kind--nothing but our bare hands to work with, and\r\nhundreds of miles between us and the place we call home. No boat, no\r\nconveyance at all. Unknown country, full of God knows what perils!\"\r\n\r\nThinking, he strode along the fine, smooth, even sands, where never\r\nyet a human foot had trodden. For the first time he seemed to realize\r\njust what this world now meant--a world devoid of others of his kind.\r\nWhile the girl and he had been among the ruins of Manhattan, or even\r\non the Hudson, they had felt some contact with the past; but here,\r\nStern's eye looked out over a world as virgin as on the primal morn.\r\nAnd a vast loneliness assailed him, a yearning almost insupportable.\r\nthat made him clench his fists and raise them to the impassive, empty\r\nsky that mocked him with its deep and azure calm.\r\n\r\nBut from the rocky point, when he had scaled its height, he saw far\r\noff to westward a rising column of vapor which for a while diverted\r\nhis thoughts. He recognized the column, even though he could not hear\r\nthe distant roaring of the cataract he knew lay under it. And,\r\nstanding erect and tall on the topmost pinnacle, eyes shaded under his\r\nlevel hand, he studied the strange sight.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the flood's rushing in again, down that vast chasm,\" he\r\nexclaimed. \"The chasm that nearly proved a grave to us! And every day\r\nthe same thing happens--but how and why? By Jove, here's a problem\r\nworthy a bigger brain than mine!\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can't solve it now. And there's enough to do, without\r\nbothering about the maelstrom--except to avoid it!\"\r\n\r\nHe swept the sea with his gaze. Far off to southward lay a dim, dark\r\nline, which at one time must have been Long Island; but it was\r\nirregular now and faint, and showed that the island had been\r\npractically submerged or swept away by the vast geodetic changes of\r\nthe age since the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nA broken shore-line, heavily wooded, stretched to east and west. Stern\r\nsought in vain for any landmark which might give him position on a\r\nshore once so familiar to him. Whether he now stood near the former\r\nsite of New Haven, whether he was in the vicinity of the one-time\r\nmouth of the Connecticut River, or whether the shore where he now\r\nstood had once been Rhode Island, there was no means of telling. Even\r\nthe far line of land on the horizon could not guide him.\r\n\r\n\"If that _is_ some remnant of Long Island,\" he mused, \"it would\r\nindicate that we're no further east than the Connecticut; but there's\r\nno way to be sure. Other islands may have been heaved up from the\r\nocean floor. There's nothing definite or certain about anything now,\r\nexcept that we're both alive, without a thing to help us but our wits\r\nand that I'm starving for something more substantial than that\r\nbreadfruit!\"\r\n\r\nWherewith he went back to Beatrice.\r\n\r\nHe found her, awake at last, sitting on the beach under the shadow of\r\nthe fern-tree branch, shaking out her hair and braiding it in two\r\nthick plaits. He brought her water in a cup deftly fashioned from a\r\nhuge leaf; and when she had drunk and eaten some of the fruit they sat\r\nand talked a while in the grateful warmth of the sun.\r\n\r\nShe seemed depressed and disheartened, at last, as they discussed what\r\nhad happened and spoke of the future.\r\n\r\n\"This last misfortune, Allan,\" said she, \"is too much. There's nothing\r\nnow except life--\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is everything!\" he interrupted, laughing. \"If we can weather a\r\ntime like that, nothing in store for us can have any terrors!\" His own\r\nspirits rose fast while he cheered the girl.\r\n\r\nHe drew his arm about her as they sat together on the beach.\r\n\r\n\"Just be patient, that's all,\" bade he. \"Just give me a day or so to\r\nfind out our location, and I'll get things going again, never fear. A\r\nweek from now we may be sailing into Boston Harbor--who knows?\"\r\n\r\nAnd, shipwrecked and destitute though they were, alone in the vast\r\nemptiness of that deserted world, yet with his optimism and his faith\r\nhe coaxed her back to cheerfulness and smiles again.\r\n\r\n\"The whole earth is ours, and the fulness thereof!\" he cried, and\r\nflung his arms defiantly outward. \"This is no time for hesitance or\r\nfear. Victory lies all before us yet. To work! To work!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nA FRESH START\r\n\r\n\r\nIndomitably the human spirit, temporarily beaten down and\r\ncrushed by misfortunes beyond all calculation, once more rose in\r\nrenewed strength to the tremendous task ahead. And, first of all,\r\nStern and the girl made a camping place in the edge of the forest,\r\nclose by the spring under the big rock.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to have a base of supplies, or something of that sort,\" the\r\nman declared. \"We can't start trekking away into the wilderness at\r\nonce, without consideration and at least some definite place where we\r\ncan store a few necessaries and to which we can retreat, in case of\r\nneed. A camp, and--if possible--a fire, these are our first\r\nrequisites.\"\r\n\r\nTheir camp they built (regardless of the protests of birds and\r\nsquirrels and many little woodland folk) roughly, yet strongly enough\r\nto offer protection from the rain, under a thick-leaved oak, which in\r\nitself gave shelter. This oak, through whose branches darted many a\r\ngay-plumaged bird of species unknown to Stern, grew up along the\r\noverhanging face of Spring Rock, as they christened it.\r\n\r\nBy filling in the space between the rock and the bole of the oak with\r\nmoss and stones, and then by building a heavy lean-to roof of leafy\r\nbranches, thatched with lashed bundles of marsh-grass, they\r\nconstructed in two days a fairly comfortable shack, hard by an\r\nabundant, never-failing supply of the finest water ever a human set\r\nlip to.\r\n\r\nHere Stern piled fragrant grasses in great quantity for the girl's\r\nbed. He himself volunteered to sleep at the doorway, on guard with his\r\nonly weapon--a jagged boulder lashed with leather thongs to a\r\nfour-foot heft, even in the; very fashion of the neolithic ancestors\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nTheir food supply reverted to such berries and fruits as they could\r\ngather in the fringes of the forest, for as yet they dared not\r\npenetrate far from the shore. To these they added a plentiful supply\r\nof clams, which they dug with sharp sticks, at low tide, far out\r\nacross the sand-flats--toiling for all the world like two of the\r\nidentical savages who in the long ago, a thousand or five thousand\r\nyears before the white man came to America, had left shell-heap\r\nmiddens along the north Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nThis shell-fish gathering brought the action of the tides to their\r\ncareful attention. The tide, they found, behaved ire an erratic\r\nmanner. Instead of two regular flows a day there was but one. And at\r\nthe ebb more than two miles of beach and sea-bottom lay exposed below\r\nthe spot where they had landed at the flood. Stern analyzed the\r\nprobable cause of this phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\"There must be two regular tides,\" he said, \"only they're lost in the\r\nfar larger flux and reflux caused by the vortex we escaped from. Any\r\nmarine geyser like that, able to, suck down water enough from the sea\r\nto lay bare two miles of beach every day and capable of throwing a\r\ncolumn of mist and spray like that across the sky, is worth investing\r\ngating. Some day you and I are going to know more about it--a lot\r\nmore!\"\r\n\r\nAnd that was truth; but little the engineer suspected how soon, or\r\nunder what surpassingly strange circus stances, the girl and he were\r\ndestined to behold once more the workings of that terrible and mighty\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nOn the third day Stern set himself to work on the problem of making\r\nfire. He had not even flint-and-steel now; nor any firearm. Had he\r\npossessed a pistol he could have collected a little birch-bark, sought\r\nout a rotten pine-stump, and discharged his weapon into the \"punk,\"\r\nthen blown the glow to a flame, and almost certainly have got a blaze.\r\nBut he lacked everything, and so was forced back to primitive man's\r\none simplest resource--friction.\r\n\r\nAs an assistant instructor in anthropology at Harvard University, he\r\nhad now and then produced fire for his class of expectant students by\r\nusing the Peruvian fire-drill; but even this simple expedient required\r\na head-strap and a jade bearing, a well-formed spindle and a bow.\r\nStern had none of these things, neither could he fashion them without\r\ntools. He had, therefore, to resort to the still more primitive method\r\nof \"fire-sawing,\" such as long, long ago the Australian bushmen had\r\nbeen wont to practice.\r\n\r\nHe was a strong man, determined and persistent; but two days more had\r\npassed, and many blisters covered his palms ere--after innumerable\r\nexperiments with different kinds of woods and varying strokes--the\r\nfirst tiny glow fell into the carefully scraped sawdust. And it was\r\nwith a fast-beating heart and tremulous breath that he blew his spark\r\nto a larger one, then laid on his shredded strips of bark and blew\r\nagain, and so at last, with a great up-welling triumph in his soul,\r\nbeheld the flicker of a flame once more.\r\n\r\nExhausted, he carefully fed that precious fire, while the girl clapped\r\nher hands with joy. In a few moments more the evening air in the dim\r\nforest aisles was gladdened by the ruddy blaze of a camp-fire at the\r\ndoor of the lean-to, and for the first time smoke went wafting up\r\namong the branches of that primeval wood.\r\n\r\n\"Now for some real meat!\" cried Stern with exultation. \"To-morrow I go\r\nhunting!\"\r\n\r\nThat evening they sat for hours feeding their fire with deadfalls,\r\nlistening to the trickle of the little spring and to the night sounds\r\nof the forest, watching the bats flicker among the dusky spaces, and\r\ngazing at the slow and solemn march of the stars beyond the leafy\r\nfretwork overhead. Stern slept but little that night, in his anxiety\r\nto keep the fire fed; and morning found him eager to be at his work\r\nwith throwing-sticks among the vistas of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nTogether they hunted that day. She carried what his skilful aim\r\nbrought down from the tangled greenery above. Birds, squirrels,\r\nchipmunks, all were welcome. Noon found them in possession of more\r\nthan thirty pieces of small game, including two hedgehogs. And for the\r\nfirst time in almost a week they tasted flesh again, roasted on a\r\nsharp stick over the glowing coals.\r\n\r\nStern hunted all that day and the next. He dressed the game with an\r\nextraordinarily large and sharp clamshell, which he whetted from time\r\nto time on a rock beside the spring. And soon the fire was overhung\r\nwith much meat, being smoked with a pine-cone smudge in preparation\r\nfor the journey into the unknown.\r\n\r\n\"Inside of a week, at this rate,\" he judged, \"we'll be able to start\r\nagain. You must set to work platting a couple of sacks. The grass\r\nalong the brook is tough and long. We can carry fifty or seventy-five\r\npounds of meat, for emergencies. Fruits we can gather on the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"And fire? Can we carry that?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can take a supply of properly dried-out woods with punk. I've\r\nalready had practice enough, so I ought to be able to get fire at any\r\ntime inside of half an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weapons?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll make you a battle-ax like my own, only lighter. That's the best\r\nwe can do for the present, till we strike some ruin or other where a\r\ncity used to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you're still bent on reaching Boston?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I reckon we're more than half-way there by now. It's the nearest\r\nbig ruin, the nearest place where we can refit and recoup the damage\r\ndone, get supplies and arms and tools, build another boat, and in\r\ngeneral take a fresh start. If we can make ten miles a day, we can\r\nreach it in; ten days or less. I think, all things considered, the\r\nBoston plan's the wisest possible one.\"\r\n\r\nShe gazed into the fire a moment before replying. Then, stirring the\r\ncoals with a stick, said she:\r\n\r\n\"All right, boy; but I've got a suggestion to make.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll do better to follow the shore all the way round.\"\r\n\r\n\"And double the distance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, even so. You know, this shore is--or used to be--flat and sandy\r\nmost of the way. We can make better progress along beaches and levels\r\nthan we can through the forest. And there's the matter of shell-fish\r\nto consider; and most important of all--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sea will guide us. We can't get lost, you understand. With the\r\nexception of cutting across the shank of Cape Cod, if the cape still\r\nexists, we needn't ever get out of sight of salt water. And it will\r\nbring us surely to the Hub.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, you're right!\" he cried enthusiastically. \"The shore-line\r\nhas it! And to-morrow morning at sunup we begin preparations in\r\nearnest. You'll weave the knapsacks while I go after still more meat.\r\nGad! Now that everything's decided, the quicker we're on our way the\r\nbetter. I'm keen to see old Tremont Hill again, and get my hands on a\r\ngood stock of arms and ammunition once more!\"\r\n\r\nThat night, long after Beatrice was sleeping soundly on her bed of\r\nodorous grasses, Allan lay musing by the lean-to door, in the red glow\r\nof the fire. He was thinking of the long and painful history of man,\r\nof the great catastrophe and of the terrible responsibility that now\r\nlay on his own shoulders.\r\n\r\nAs in a panorama, he saw the emergence of humanity from the animal\r\nstage, the primitive savagery of his kind; then the beginnings of the\r\nfamily, the nomadic epoch, the stone age, and the bronze age, and the\r\nage of iron; the struggle up to agriculturalism, and communism, and\r\nthe beginnings of the village groups, with all their petty tribal\r\nwars.\r\n\r\nHe saw the slow formation of small states, the era of slavery, then\r\nfeudalism and serfdom, and at last the birth of modern nations, the\r\ndevelopment of machinery, and the vast nexus of exploitation known as\r\ncapitalism--the stage which at one blow had been utterly destroyed\r\njust as it had been transmuting into collectivism.\r\n\r\nAnd at thought of this Stern felt a pang of infinite regret.\r\n\r\n\"The whole evolutionary process wiped out,\" mused he, \"just as it was\r\nabout to pass into its perfect form, toward which the history of all\r\nthe ages had conspired, for which oceans of blood had been spilled and\r\nmillions of men and women--billions!--lived and toiled and died!\r\n\r\n\"All gone, all vanished--it's all been in vain, the woe and travail of\r\nthe world since time began, unless she and I, just we two, preserve\r\nthe memory and the knowledge of the world's long, bitter fight, and\r\nhand them down to strong descendants.\r\n\r\n\"Our problem is to bridge this gap, to keep the fires of science and\r\nof truth alive, and, if that be possible, to start the world again on\r\na higher plane, where all the harsh and terrible phases will no longer\r\nhave to be lived through again. Our problem and our task! Were ever\r\ntwo beings weighed by such a one?\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he pondered, in the firelight, his thoughts and dreams and\r\nhopes all centered in the sleeping girl, there in the lean-to\r\nsheltered by his watchful care. But what those dreams were, what his\r\nvisions of the future--who shall set forth or fully understand?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nLABOR AND COMRADESHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nFour days later, having hastened all their preparations and\r\nworked with untiring energy, they broke camp for the long, perilous\r\ntrek in quest of the ruins of a dead and buried city.\r\n\r\nIt was at daylight that they started from the little shack in the edge\r\nof the forest. Both were refreshed by a long sleep and by a plunge in\r\nthe curling breakers that now, at high tide, were driven up the beach\r\nby a stiff sea-breeze.\r\n\r\nThe morning, which must have been toward the end of September--Stern\r\nhad lost accurate count but reckoned the day at about the\r\ntwenty-fifth--dawned clear and bracing, with just a tang of winelike\r\nexhilaration in the air. Before them the beach spread away and away to\r\neastward, beyond the line of vision, a broad and yellow road to bid\r\nthem travel on.\r\n\r\n\"Come, girl, _en marche!_\" cried the man cheerily, as he adjusted\r\nBeta's knapsack so that the platted cord should not chafe her\r\nshoulders, then swung his own across his back. And with a buoyant\r\nsense of conquest, yet a regret at leaving the little camp which,\r\nthough crude and rough, had yet been a home to them for a week, they\r\nturned their faces to the rising sun and set out on the journey into\r\nthe unexplored.\r\n\r\nMuch altered were they now from those days at Hope Villa, when they\r\nhad been able to restore most of the necessities and even some of the\r\nrefinements of civilization. Now the girl's hair hung in two thick\r\nbraids down over her worn tiger-skin, each braid as big as a strong\r\nman's wrist, for she lacked any means to do it up; she had not so much\r\nas a comb, nor could Stern, without a knife, fashion one for her.\r\nTheir sandals hung in tatters. Stern had tried to repair them with\r\nstrips of squirrel-skin clumsily hacked out with the sharp clam-shell,\r\nbut the result was crude.\r\n\r\nLong were his hair and beard, untrimmed now, unkempt and red. Clad in\r\nhis ragged fur garment, bare legged and bare armed, with the\r\ngrass-cloth sack slung over his sinewy shoulder and the heavy stone-ax\r\nin his hand, he looked the very image of prehistoric man--as she, too,\r\nseemed the woman of that distant age.\r\n\r\nBut though their outward guise was that of savages far cruder than the\r\nNorth American Indian was when Columbus first beheld him, yet in their\r\nbrains lay all the splendid inheritance of a world-civilization. And\r\nas the fire-materials in Stern's sack contained, in germ, all the\r\nmechanic arts, so their joint intelligence presaged everything that\r\nyet might be.\r\n\r\nThey traveled at an easy pace, like voyagers who foresee many hard\r\ndays of journeying and who are cautious not at first to drain their\r\nstrength. Five hours they walked, with now and then a pause. Stern\r\ncalculated they had made twelve miles or more before they camped\r\nbeside a stream that flowing thinly from the wood, sank into the sand\r\nand was lost before it reached the sea.\r\n\r\nHere they ate and rested till the sun began to pass its meridian, when\r\nonce more they started on their pilgrimage. That night, after a day\r\nwherein they had met no other sign of life than gulls and crows\r\nravaging the mussel-beds, they slept on piles of sun-dried kelp which\r\nthey heaped into some crevices under an overhanging brow of low cliffs\r\non a rocky point. And dawn found them again, traveling steadily\r\neastward, battle-axes swinging, hopes high, in perfect comradeship and\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nToward what must have been about ten o'clock of that morning they\r\nreached the mouth of a river, something like half a mile wide where it\r\njoined the sea. By following this up a mile or so they reached a\r\nnarrow point; but even here, burdened as they were, swimming was out\r\nof the question.\r\n\r\n\"The only thing to do,\" said Stern, \"will be to wait till the tide\r\nbacks up and gives us quiet water, then make our way across on a log\r\nor two\"--a plan they put into effect with good success. Mid-afternoon,\r\nand they were on their way again, east-bound.\r\n\r\n\"Was that the Connecticut?\" asked Beatrice. \"Car do you think we've\r\npassed that already?\"\r\n\r\n\"More likely to be the Thames,\" he answered. \"I figure that what used\r\nbe New London is less than five miles from here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not visit the ruins? There might be something there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not enough to bother with. We mustn't be diverted from the main\r\nissue, Boston! Forward, march!\"\r\n\r\nNext day Stern descried a point jutting far out to sea, which he\r\ndeclared was none other than Watch Hill Point, on the Rhode Island\r\nboundary. And on the afternoon of the following day they reached what\r\nwas indisputably Point Judith and Narragansett Bay.\r\n\r\nHere they were forced to turn northward; and when camping time came,\r\nafter they had dug their due allowance of clams and gathered their\r\nbreadfruit and made their fire in the edge of the woods, they held\r\nconclave about their future course.\r\n\r\nThe bay was, indeed, a factor neither Stern nor she had reckoned on.\r\nTo follow its detours all the way around would add seventy to a\r\nhundred miles to their journey, according as they hugged the shore or\r\nmade straight cuts across some of the wooded promontories.\r\n\r\n\"And from Providence, at the head of the bay, to Boston, is only forty\r\nmiles in a direct line northwest-by-north,\" said he, poking the fire\r\ncontemplatively.\r\n\r\n\"But if we miss our way?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we, if we follow the remains of the railroad? The cuts and\r\nembankments will guide us all the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know; but the forest is so thick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so thick but we can make at least five miles a day. That is,\r\ninside of eight days we can reach the Hub. And we shall have the help\r\nof tools and guns, remember. In a place the size of Providence there\r\nmust be a few ruins still containing something of value. Yes, by all\r\nmeans the overland route is best, from now on. It means forty miles\r\ninstead of probably two hundred.\"\r\n\r\nThus they agreed upon it; and, having settled matters, gave them no\r\nmore thought, but prepared for rest. And sunset came down once more;\r\nit faded, smoldering along the forest-line to westward; it burned to\r\ndull timbers and vague purples, then went out. And \"the wind that runs\r\nafter the sun awoke and sang softly among the tree-tops, a while, like\r\nthe intoning of a choir invisible, and was silent again.\"\r\n\r\nThere by the firelight he half saw, half sensed her presence, vague\r\nand beautiful despite the travel-worn, tattered skin that clothed her.\r\nHe felt her warm, vital nearness; his hand sought hers and pressed it,\r\nand the pressure was returned. And with a thrill of overwhelming\r\ntenderness he realized what this girl was to him and what his love\r\nmeant and what it all portended.\r\n\r\nUntil long after dark they sat and talked of the future, and of life\r\nand death, and of the soul and of the great mystery that had swept the\r\nearth clean of all of their kind and had left them, alone, of all\r\nthose fifteen hundred million human creatures.\r\n\r\nAnd overhead, blotting out a patch of sky and stars, moved slowly the\r\ndark object which had so puzzled Stern since the first time he had\r\nobserved it--the thing he meant to know about and solve, once he could\r\nreach the Cambridge Observatory. And of this, too, they talked; but\r\nneither he nor she could solve the riddle of its nature.\r\n\r\nTheir talk together, that night, was typical of the relationship that\r\nhad grown up between them in the long weeks since their awakening in\r\nthe Tower. Almost all, if not quite all, the old-time idea of sex had\r\nfaded--the old, false assumption on the part of the man that he was by\r\nhis very nature the superior of woman.\r\n\r\nStern and Beatrice now stood on a different footing; their friendship,\r\ncomradeship and love were based on the tacit recognition of absolute\r\nequality, save for Stern's accidental physical superiority. It was as\r\nthough they had been two men, one a little stronger and larger than\r\nthe other, so far as the notion of equality went; though this by no\r\nmeans destroyed that magnetic sex-emotion which, in other aspects,\r\nthrilled and attracted and infused them both.\r\n\r\nTheir love never for a moment obscured Stern's recognition of the girl\r\nas primarily a human being, his associate on even terms in this great\r\ngame that they were playing together, this tremendous problem they\r\nwere laboring to solve--the vastest and most vital problem that ever\r\nyet had confronted the human race, now represented in its totality by\r\nthese two living creatures.\r\n\r\nAnd as Beatrice recalled the world of other times, with all its false\r\nconventions, limitations and pettily stupid gallantries, she shuddered\r\nwith repulsion. In her heart she knew that, had the choice been hers,\r\nshe would not have gone back to that former state of half-chattel\r\npatronage, half-hypocritical homage and total misconception.\r\n\r\nContrasting her present state with her past one, and comparing this\r\nman--all ragged, unshaven and long-haired as he was, yet a true man in\r\nevery inch of his lithe, virile body--with others she remembered, she\r\nfound up-welling in her a love so deep and powerful, grounded on such\r\nbroad bases of respect and gratitude, mutual interest and latent\r\npassion, that she herself could not yet understand it in all its\r\nphases and its moods.\r\n\r\nThe relation which had grown up between them, comrades and partners in\r\nall things, partook of a fine tolerance, an exquisite and\r\nnever-failing tenderness, a wealth of all intimate, yet respectful\r\nadoration. It held elements of brotherhood and parenthood; it was the\r\nlove of coworkers striving toward a common goal, of companions in life\r\nand in learning, in striving, doing, accomplishing, even failing.\r\nFailure mattered nothing; for still the comradeship was there.\r\n\r\nAnd on this soil was growing daily and hourly a love such as never\r\nsince the world began had been equaled in purity and power, faith,\r\nhope, integrity. It purified all things, made easy all things, braved\r\nall things, pardoned all things; it was long-suffering and very kind.\r\n\r\nThey had no need to speak of it; it showed in every word and look and\r\nact, even in the humblest and most commonplace of services each for\r\neach. Their love was lived, not talked about.\r\n\r\nAll their trials and tremendous hardships, their narrow passes with\r\ndeath, and their hard-won escapes, the vicissitudes of a savage life\r\nin the open, with every imaginable difficulty and hard expedient,\r\ncould not destroy their illusions or do aught than bind them in closer\r\nbonds of unity.\r\n\r\nAnd each realized when the time should ripen for another and a more\r\nvital love, that, too, would circle them with deeper tenderness,\r\nbinding them in still more intense and poignant bonds of joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nFINDING THE BIPLANE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way up the shores of Narragansett Bay was full of\r\nexperiences for them both. Animal life revealed itself far more\r\nabundantly here than along the open sea.\r\n\r\n\"Some strange blight or other must lie in the proximity of that\r\nterrific maelstrom,\" judged Stern, \"something that repels all the\r\nlarger animals. But skirting this bay, there's life and to spare. How\r\nmany deer have we seen to-day? Three? And one bull-buffalo! With any\r\nkind of a gun, or even a revolver, I could have had them all. And that\r\nbig-muzzled, shaggy old moose we saw drinking at the pool, back there,\r\nwould have been meat for us if we had had a rifle. No danger of\r\nstarving here, Beatrice, once we get our hands on something that'll\r\nshoot again!\"\r\n\r\nThe night they camped on the way, Stern kept constant guard by the\r\nfire, in case of possible attack by wolves or other beasts. He slept\r\nonly an hour, when the girl insisted on taking his place; but when the\r\nsun arose, red and huge through the mists upon the bay, he started out\r\nagain on the difficult trail as strong and confident as though he had\r\nnot kept nine hours of vigil.\r\n\r\nEverywhere was change and desolation. As the travelers came into a\r\nregion which had at one time been more densely populated, they began\r\nto find here and there mournful relics of the life that once had\r\nbeen--traces of man, dim and all but obliterated, but now and then\r\npuissant in their revocation of the distant past.\r\n\r\nTwice they found the ruins of villages--a few vague hollows in the\r\nearth, where cellars had been, hollows in which huge trees were\r\nrooted, and where, perhaps, a grass-grown crumble of disintegrated\r\nbrick indicated the one-time presence of a chimney. They discovered\r\nseveral farms, with a few stunted apple-trees, the distant descendants\r\nof orchard growths, struggling against the larger forest strength, and\r\nwith perhaps a dismantled well-curb, a moss-covered fireplace or a few\r\nbits of iron that had possibly been a stove, for all relics of the\r\nother age. Mournful were the long stone walls, crumbling down yet\r\nstill discernible in places--walls that had cost the labor of\r\ngenerations of farmers and yet now lay useless and forgotten in the\r\nuniversal ruin of the world.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the fifth day since having left their lean-to by\r\nthe shore of Long Island Sound, they came upon a canyon which split\r\nthe hills north of the site of Greenwich, a gigantic \"fault\" in the\r\nrocks, richly striated and stratified with rose and red and umber, a\r\ngreat cleft on the other side of which the forest lay somber and\r\nrepellent in the slanting rays of the September sun.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, whatever it was that struck the earth,\" said Stern, \"must\r\nhave been good and plenty. The whole planet seems to be ripped up and\r\nbroken and shattered. No wonder it knocked down New York and killed\r\neverybody and put an end to civilization. Why, there's ten cubic miles\r\nof material gouged out right here in sight; here's a regular Panama\r\nCanal, or bigger, all scooped out in one piece! What the devil could\r\nhave happened?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer to the question. After an hour spent in studying\r\nthe formations along the lip of the cleft they made a detour eastward\r\nto the shore, crossed the fjord that ran into the canyon, and again\r\nkept to the north. Soon after this they struck a railroad embankment,\r\nand this they followed now, both because it afforded easier travel\r\nthan the shore, which now had grown rocky and broken, and also because\r\nit promised to guide them surely to the place they sought.\r\n\r\nIt was on the sixth day of their exploration that they at last\r\npenetrated the ruins of Providence. Here, as in New York, pavements\r\nand streets and squares were all grassed over and covered with pines\r\nand elms and oaks, rooting among the stones and shattered brickwork\r\nthat lay prone upon the earth. Only here or there a steel or concrete\r\nbuilding still defied the ravages of time.\r\n\r\n\"The wreckage is even more complete here than on Manhattan Island,\"\r\nStern judged as he and the girl stood in front of the ruins of the\r\npost-office surveying the debris. \"The smaller area, of course, would\r\nnaturally be covered sooner with the inroads of the forest. I doubt\r\nwhether there's enough left in the whole place to be of any real\r\nservice to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow will be time enough to see,\" answered the girl. \"It's too\r\nlate now for any more work to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThey camped that night in an upper story of the Pequot National Bank\r\nBuilding on Hampstead Street. Here, having cleared out the bats and\r\nspiders, they made themselves an eerie secure from attack, and slept\r\nlong and soundly. Dawn found them at work among the overgrown ruins,\r\nmuch as--three months before--they had labored in the Metropolitan\r\nTower and about it. Less, however, remained to salvage here. For the\r\nsmaller and lighter types of buildings had preserved far less of the\r\nrelics of civilization than had been left in the vast and solid\r\nstructures of New York.\r\n\r\nIn a few places, none the less, they still came upon the little piles\r\nof the gray ash that marked where men and women had fallen and died;\r\nbut these occurred only in the most sheltered spots. Stern paid no\r\nattention to them. His energies and his attention were now fixed on\r\nthe one task of getting skins, arms, ammunition and supplies. And\r\nbefore nightfall, by a systematic looting of such shops as\r\nremained--perhaps not above a score in all could even be entered--the\r\ngirl and he had gathered more than enough to last them on their way to\r\nBoston. One find which pleased him immensely was a dozen sealed glass\r\njars of tobacco.\r\n\r\n\"As for a pipe,\" said he, \"I can make that easily enough. What's more\r\nI will!\" More still, he did, that very evening, and the gloom was\r\nredolent again of good smoke. Thereafter he slept as not for a long,\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\nThey spent the next day in fashioning new garments and sandals; in\r\nputting to rights the two rifles Stern had chosen from the basement of\r\nthe State armory, and in making bandoliers to carry their supply of\r\ncartridges. The possession of a knife once more, and of steel\r\nwherewith readily to strike fire, delighted the man enormously. The\r\nscissors they found in a hardware-shop, though rusty, enabled him to\r\ntrim his beard and hair. Beatrice hailed a warped hard-rubber comb\r\nwith joy.\r\n\r\nBut the great discovery still awaited them, the one supreme find which\r\nin a moment changed every plan of travel, opened the world to them,\r\nand at a single stroke increased their hopes ten thousandfold--the\r\ndiscovery of the old Pauillac monoplane!\r\n\r\nThey came upon this machine, pregnant with such vast possibilities, in\r\na concrete hangar back of the Federal courthouse on Anderson Street.\r\nThe building attracted Stern's attention by its unusual state of\r\npreservation. He burst in one of the rusted iron shutters and climbed\r\nthrough the window to see what might be inside.\r\n\r\nA moment later Beatrice heard a cry of astonishment and joy.\r\n\r\n\"Great Heavens!\" the man exclaimed, appearing at the window. \"Come in!\r\nCome in--see what I've found!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he stretched out his hands to help her up and through the\r\naperture.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, boy? More arms? More--\"\r\n\r\n\"An aeroplane! Good God, think o' that, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"An aeroplane? But it's all to pieces, of course, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on in and look at it, I say!\" Excitedly he lifted her through\r\nthe window. \"See there, will you? Isn't that the eternal limit? And to\r\nthink I never even thought of trying to find one in New York!\"\r\n\r\nHe gestured at the dust-laden old machine that, forlorn and in\r\nsovereign disrepair, stood at the other end of the hangar. Together\r\nthey approached it.\r\n\r\n\"If it will work,\" the man exclaimed thickly; \"_if it will only\r\nwork--_\"\r\n\r\n\"But will it?\" the girl exclaimed, her eyes lighting with the\r\nexcitement of the find, heart beating fast at thought of what it might\r\nportend. \"Can you put it in shape, boy? Or--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Let me look! Who knows? Maybe--\"\r\n\r\nAnd already he was kneeling, peering at the mechanism, feeling the\r\nframe, the gear, the stays, with hands that trembled more than ever\r\nthey had trembled since their great adventure had begun.\r\n\r\nAs he examined the machine, while Beatrice stood by, he talked to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Good thing the framework is aluminum,\" said he, \"or it wouldn't be\r\nworth a tinker's dam after all this time. But as it is, it's taken no\r\nharm that I can see. Wire braces all gone, rusted out and disappeared.\r\nHave to be rewired throughout, if I can find steel wire; if not, I'll\r\nuse braided leather thongs. Petrol tank and feed pipe O. K. Girder\r\nboom needs a little attention. Steering and control column\r\nintact--they'll do!\"\r\n\r\nPart by part he handled the machine, his skilled eye leaping from\r\ndetail to detail.\r\n\r\n\"Canvas planes all gone, of course. Not a rag left; only the frame.\r\nBut, no matter, we can remedy that. Wooden levers, skids, and so on,\r\ngone. Easily replaced. Main thing is the engine. Looks as though it\r\nhad been carefully covered, but, of course, the covering has rotted\r\naway. No matter, we'll soon see. Now, this carbureter--\"\r\n\r\nHis inspection lasted half an hour, while the girl, lost among so many\r\ntechnicalities, sat down on the dusty concrete floor beside the\r\nmachine and listened in a kind of dazed admiration.\r\n\r\nHe gave her, finally, his opinion.\r\n\r\n\"This machine _will go_ if properly handled,\" said he, rising\r\ntriumphantly and slapping the dust off his palms. \"The chassis needs\r\ntruing up, the equilibrator has sagged out of plumb, and the ailerons\r\nhave got to be readjusted, but it's only a matter of a few days at the\r\noutside before she'll be in shape.\r\n\r\n\"The main thing is the engine, and so far as I can judge, that's\r\npretty nearly O. K. The magneto may have to be gone over, but that's a\r\nmere trifle. Odd, I never thought of either finding one of these\r\nmachines in New York, or building one! When I think of all the weary\r\nmiles we've tramped it makes me sick!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" she answered; \"but how about fuel? And another thing--have\r\nyou ever operated one? Could you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Run one?\" He laughed aloud. \"I'm the man who first taught Carlton\r\nHolmes to fly--you know Holmes, who won the Gordon-Craig cup for\r\naltitude record in 1916. I built the first--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, dear; but Holmes was killed at Schenectady, you remember, and\r\nthis machine is different from anything you're used to, isn't it?\"\r\nBeatrice asked.\r\n\r\n\"It won't be when I'm through with it! I tell you, Beatrice, we're\r\ngoing to fly. No more hiking through the woods or along beaches for\r\nus. From now on we travel in the air--and the world opens out to us as\r\nthough by magic.\r\n\r\n\"Distance ceases to mean anything. The whole continent is ours. If\r\nthere's another human creature on it we find him! And if there isn't\r\nthen, perhaps we may find some in Asia or in Europe, who knows?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you'd dare to attack the Atlantic with a patched-up machine\r\nmore than a thousand years old?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean that eventually I can and will build one that'll take us to\r\nAlaska, and so across the fifty-mile gap from Cape Prince of Wales to\r\nEast Cape. The whole world lies at our feet, girl, with this new idea,\r\nthis new possibility in mind!\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled at his enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"But fuel?\" asked she, practical even in her joy. \"I don't imagine\r\nthere's any gasoline left now, do you? A stuff as volatile as that,\r\nafter all these centuries? What metal could contain it for a thousand\r\nyears?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's alcohol,\" he answered. \"A raid on the ruins of a few saloons\r\nand drug-stores will give me all I need to carry me to Boston, where\r\nthere's plenty, never fear. A few slight adjustments of the engine\r\nwill fit it for burning alcohol. And as for the planes, good stout\r\nbuckskin, well sewn together and stretched on the frames, will do the\r\ntrick as well as canvas--better, maybe.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a little pessimist it is to-day!\" he interrupted. \"Always\r\ncoming at me with objections, eh?\" He took her in his arms and kissed\r\nher. \"I tell you Beta, this is no pipe-dream at all, or anything like\r\nit; the thing's reality--we're going to fly! But it'll mean the most\r\ntremendous lot of sewing and stitching for you!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a dear!\" she answered inconsequentially. \"I do believe if the\r\nwhole world fell apart you could put it together again.\"\r\n\r\n\"With your help, yes,\" said he. \"What's more, I'm going to--and a\r\nbetter world at that than ever yet was dreamed of. Wait and see!\"\r\n\r\nLaughing, he released her.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, we'll go to work,\" he concluded. \"Nothing's accomplished\r\nby mere words. Just lay hold of that lateral there, will you? And\r\nwe'll haul this old machine out where we can have a real good look at\r\nher, what do yore say? Now, then, one, two, three--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nALL ABOARD FOR BOSTON!\r\n\r\n\r\nNineteen days from the discovery of the biplane, a singular\r\nhappening for a desolate world took place on the broad beach that now\r\nedged the city where once the sluggish Providence River had flowed\r\nseaward.\r\n\r\nFor here, clad in a double suit of leather that Beatrice had made for\r\nhim, Allan Stern was preparing to give the rehabilitated Pauillac a\r\ntry-out.\r\n\r\nDay by day, working incessantly when not occupied in hunting or\r\nfishing, the man had rebuilt and overhauled the entire mechanism.\r\nTools he had found a-plenty in the ruins, tools which he had ground\r\nand readjusted with consummate care and skill. Alcohol he had gathered\r\ntogether from a score of sources. All the wooden parts, such as skids\r\nand levers and propellers, long since vanished and gone, he had\r\ncleverly rebuilt.\r\n\r\nAnd now the machine, its planes and rudders covered with strongly sewn\r\nbuckskin, stretched as tight as drum heads, its polished screw of the\r\nChauviere type gleaming in the morning sun, stood waiting on\r\nthe sands, while Stern gave it a painstaking inspection.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" he judged, as he tested the last stay and gave the engine\r\nits final adjustment. \"I think, upon my word, this machine's better\r\nto-day than when she was first built. If I'm not mistaken, buckskin's\r\na better material for planes than ever canvas was--it's far stronger\r\nand less porous, for one thing--and as for the stays, I prefer the\r\nbraided hide. Wire's so liable to snap.\r\n\r\n\"This compass I've rigged on gimbals here, beats anything Pauillac\r\nhimself ever had. What's the matter with my home-made gyrostat and\r\nanemometer? And hasn't this aneroid barometer got cards and spades\r\nover the old-style models?\"\r\n\r\nEnthusiastic as a boy, Stern shook his head and smiled delightedly at\r\nBeatrice as he expounded the merits of the biplane and its fittings.\r\nShe, half glad, half anxious at the possible outcome of the venture,\r\nstood by and listened and nodded as though she understood all the\r\nminutiae he explained.\r\n\r\n\"So then, you're ready to go up this morning?\" she asked, with just a\r\nquiver of nervousness in her voice. \"You're quite certain everything's\r\nall right--no chance of accident? For if anything happened--\"\r\n\r\n\"There, there, nothing can happen, nothing will!\" he reassured her.\r\n\"This motor's been run three hours in succession already without\r\nskipping an explosion. Everything's in absolute order, I tell you. And\r\nas for the human, personal equation, I can vouch for that myself!\"\r\n\r\nStern walked around to the back of the machine, picked up a long,\r\nstout stake he had prepared, took his ax, and at a distance of about\r\ntwelve feet behind the biplane drove the stake very deep into the hard\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nHe knotted a strong leather cord to the stake, brought it forward and\r\nsecured it to the frame of the machine.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Beatrice,\" he directed, \"when I'm ready you cut the cord. I\r\nhaven't any corps of assistants to hold me back till the right moment\r\nand then give me a shove, so the best I can do is this. Give a quick\r\nslash right here when I shout. And whatever happens don't be alarmed.\r\nI'll come back to you safe and sound, never fear. And this afternoon\r\nit's 'All Aboard for Boston!'\"\r\n\r\nSmiling and confident, he cranked the motor. It caught, and now a\r\nchattering tumult filled the air, rising, falling, as Stern\r\nmanipulated throttle and spark to test them once again.\r\n\r\nInto the driver's seat he climbed, strapped himself in and turned to\r\nsmile at Beatrice.\r\n\r\nThen with a practiced hand he threw the lever operating the\r\nfriction-clutch on the propeller-shaft. And now the great blades began\r\nto twirl, faster, faster, till they twinkled and buzzed in the\r\nsunlight with a hum like that of a gigantic electric fan.\r\n\r\nThe machine, yielding to the urge, tugged forward, straining at its\r\nbonds like a whippet eager for a race. Beatrice, her face flushed with\r\nexcitement, stood ready with the knife.\r\n\r\nLouder, faster whirled the blades, making a shiny blur; a breeze\r\nsprang out behind them; it became a wind, blowing the girl's hair back\r\nfrom her beautiful face.\r\n\r\nStern settled himself more firmly into the seat and gripped the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe engine was roaring like a battery of Northrup looms. Stern felt\r\nthe pull, the power, the life of the machine. And his heart leaped\r\nwithin him at his victory over the dead past, his triumph still to be!\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" he cried. \"Let go--_let go!_\"\r\n\r\nThe knife fell. The parted rope jerked back, writhing, like a wounded\r\nserpent.\r\n\r\nGently at first, then with greater and greater speed, shaking and\r\nbouncing a little on the broad, flat wheels that Stern had fitted to\r\nthe alighting gear, the plane rolled off along the firm-beaten sands.\r\n\r\nStern advanced the spark and now the screw sang a louder, higher\r\nthrenody. With ever-accelerating velocity the machine tooled forward\r\ndown the long stretch, while Beatrice stood gazing after it in rapt\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThen all at once, when it had sped some three hundred feet, Stern\r\nrotated the rising plane; and suddenly the machine lifted. In a long\r\nsmooth curve, she slid away up the air as though it had been a solid\r\nhill--up, up, up--swifter and swifter now, till a suddenly accelerated\r\nrush cleared the altitude of the tallest pines in the forest edging\r\nthe beach, and Stern knew his dream was true!\r\n\r\nWith a great shout of joy, he leaped the plane aloft! Its rise had all\r\nthe exhilarating suddenness of a seagull flinging up from the\r\nfoam-streaked surface of the breakers. And in that moment Stern felt\r\nthe bliss of conquest.\r\n\r\nBehind him, the spruce propellers were making a misty haze of humming\r\nenergy. In front, the engine spat and clattered. The vast spread of\r\nthe leather wings, sewn, stretched and tested, crackled and boomed as\r\nthe wind got under them and heaved them skyward.\r\n\r\nStern shouted again. The machine, he felt, was a thing of life,\r\nfriendly and true. Not since that time in the tower, months ago, when\r\nhe had repaired the big steamengine and actually made it run, had he\r\nenjoyed so real a sense of mastery over the world as now; had he\r\nsensed so definite a connection with the mechanical powers of the\r\nworld that was, the world that still should be.\r\n\r\nNo longer now was he fighting the forces of nature, all barehanded and\r\nalone. Now back of him lay the energy of a machine, a metal heart,\r\nthrobbing and inexhaustible and full of life! Now he had tapped the\r\nvein of Power! And in his ears the ripping volley of the exhaust\r\nsounded as sweetly as might the voice of a long-absent and beloved\r\ngirl returning to her sweetheart.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he felt a choking in his throat, a mist before his eyes.\r\nThis triumph stirred him emotionally, practical and cool and keen\r\nthough he was. His hand trembled a second; his heart leaped, throbbing\r\nlike the motor itself.\r\n\r\nBut almost immediately he was himself once more. The weakness passed.\r\nAnd with a sweep of his clear eyes, he saw the speeding landscape,\r\nwoods, hills, streams, that now were running there beneath him like a\r\nfluid map.\r\n\r\n\"My God, it's grand, though!\" he exclaimed, swerving the plane in a\r\nlong, ascending spiral. All the art, the knack of flight came back to\r\nhim, at the touch of the wheel, as readily as swimming to an expert in\r\nthe water. Fear? The thought no more occurred to him than to you,\r\nreading these words.\r\n\r\nHigher he mounted, higher still, his hair whipping out behind in the\r\nwild wind, till he could see the sparkle of Narragansett Bay, there in\r\nthe distance where the river broadened into it. At him the wind tore,\r\nlouder even than the spitting crackle of the motor. He only laughed,\r\nand soared again.\r\n\r\nBut now he thought of Beatrice; and, as he banked and came about, he\r\npeered far down for sight of her.\r\n\r\nYes, there she stood, a tiny dot upon the distant sand. And though he\r\nknew she could not hear, in sheer animal spirits and overwhelming joy\r\nhe shouted once again, a wild, mad triumphant hurrah that lost itself\r\nin empty space.\r\n\r\nThe test he gave the Pauillac convinced him she would carry all the\r\nload they would need put upon her, and more. He climbed, swooped,\r\nspiraled, volplaned, and rose again, executing a series of evolutions\r\nthat would have won him fame at any aero meet. And when, after half an\r\nhour's exhaustive trial, he swooped down toward the beach again, he\r\nfound the plane alighted as easily as she had risen.\r\n\r\nLike a sea-bird sinking with flat, outstretched wings, coming to rest\r\nwith perfect ease and beauty on the surface of the deep, the Pauillac\r\nslid down the long hill of air. Stern cut off power. The machine took\r\nthe sand with no more than vigorous bound, and, running forward\r\nperhaps fifty yards, came to a stand.\r\n\r\nStern had no sooner leaped from the seat than Beatrice was with him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, glorious!\" she cried, her face alight with joy and fine\r\nenthusiasm. All her spontaneity, her love and admiration were aroused.\r\nAnd she kissed him with so frank and glad a love that Stern felt his\r\nheart jump wildly. He thought she never yet had been so beautiful.\r\n\r\nBut all he said was:\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't run finer, little girl! Barring a little stiffness here and\r\nthere, she's perfect. So, then, when do we start, eh? To-morrow\r\nmorning, early?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not this afternoon? I'm sure we can get ready by then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Afternoon it is, if you say so! But we've got to work, to do it!\"\r\n\r\nBy noon they had gathered together all the freight they meant to\r\ncarry, and--though the sun had dimmed behind dull clouds of a peculiar\r\nslaty gray, that drifted in from eastward--had prepared for the flight\r\nto Boston. After a plentiful dinner of venison, berries and\r\nbreadfruit, they loaded the machine.\r\n\r\nStern calculated that, with Beatrice as a passenger, he could carry\r\nseventy-five or eighty pounds of freight. The two rifles, ammunition,\r\nknives, ax, tools and provisions they packed into the skin sack\r\nBeatrice had prepared, weighed no more than sixty. Thus Stern reckoned\r\nthere would be a fair \"coefficient of safety\" and more than enough\r\npower to carry them with safety and speed.\r\n\r\nIt was at 1:15 that the girl took her place in the passenger's seat\r\nand let Stern strap her in.\r\n\r\n\"Your first flight, little girl?\" he asked smiling, yet a trifle\r\ngrave. The barking motor almost drowned his voice.\r\n\r\nShe nodded but did not speak. He noted the pulse in her throat, a\r\nlittle quick, yet firm.\r\n\r\n\"You're positive you're not going to be afraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I, with you?\"\r\n\r\nHe made all secure, climbed up beside her, and strapped himself in his\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nThen he threw in the clutch and released the brake.\r\n\r\n\"Hold fast!\" cried he. \"All aboard for Boston! Hold fast!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE HURRICANE\r\n\r\n\r\nSoaring strongly even under the additional weight, humming with\r\nthe rush of air, the plane made the last turn of her spiral and\r\nstraightened out at the height of twelve hundred feet for her long\r\nnorthward run across the unbroken wilderness.\r\n\r\nStern preferred to fly a bit high, believing the air-currents more\r\ndependable there. Even as he rose above the forest-level, his\r\nexperienced eye saw possible trouble in the wind-clouds banked to\r\neastward and in the fall of the barometer. But with the thought, \"At\r\nthis rate we'll make Boston in three-quarters of an hour at the\r\noutside, and the storm can't strike so soon,\" he pushed the motor to\r\nstill greater speed and settled to the urgent business of steering a\r\nstraight course for Massachusetts Bay.\r\n\r\nOnly once did he dare turn aside his eyes even so much as to glance at\r\nBeatrice. She, magnificently unafraid on the quivering back of this\r\nhuge airdragon, showed the splendid excitement of the moment by the\r\nsparkle of her glance, the rush of eloquent blood to her cheeks.\r\n\r\nStern's achievement, typical of the invincible conquest of the human\r\nsoul over matter, time and space, thrilled her with unspeakable pride.\r\nAnd as she breathed for the first time the pure, thin air of those\r\nupper regions, her strong heart leaped within her breast, and she knew\r\nthat this man was worthy of her most profound, indissoluble love.\r\n\r\nFar down beneath them now the forest sped away to southward. The gleam\r\nof the river, dulled by the sunless sky, showed here and there through\r\nthe woods, which spread their unbroken carpet to the horizon,\r\nimpenetrable and filled with nameless perils. At thought of how he was\r\ncheating them all, Stern smiled to himself with grim satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Good old engine!\" he was thinking, as he let her out another notch.\r\n\"Some day I'll put you in a boat, and we'll go cruising. With you,\r\nthere's no limit to the possibilities. The world is really ours now,\r\nwith your help!\"\r\n\r\nBehind them now lay the debris of Pawtucket. Stern caught a glimpse of\r\na ruined building, a crumpled-in gas-tank with an elm growing up\r\nthrough the stark ribs of it, a jumble of wreckage, all small and\r\ntoylike, there below; then the plane swooped onward, and all lay deep\r\nburied in the wilderness again.\r\n\r\n\"A few minutes now,\" he said to himself, \"and we'll be across what\r\nused to be the line, and be spinning over Massachusetts. This\r\ncertainly beats walking all hollow! Whew!\" as the machine lurched\r\nforward and took an ugly drop. He jerked the rising-plane lever\r\nsavagely. \"Still the same kind of unreliable air, I see, that we used\r\nto have a thousand years ago!\"\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes the biplane hummed on and on in long rising and\r\nfalling slants, like a swallow skimming the surface of a lake. The\r\neven staccato of the exhaust, echoless in that height and vacancy,\r\nrippled with cadences like a monster mowing-machine. And Stern was\r\nbeginning to consider himself as good as in Boston already--was\r\nbeginning to wonder where the best place might be to land, whether\r\nalong the shore or on the Common, where, perhaps, some open space\r\nstill remained--when another formidable air-pocket dropped him with\r\nsickening speed.\r\n\r\nHe righted the plane with a wrench that made her creak and tremble.\r\n\r\n\"I've got to take a higher level, or a lower,\" he thought.\r\n\"Something's wrong here, that's certain!\"\r\n\r\nBut as he shot the biplane sharply upward, hoping to find a calmer\r\nlane, a glance at the sky showed trouble impending.\r\n\r\nOver the gray background of wind-clouds, a fine-shredded drive was\r\nbeginning to scud. The whole east had grown black. Only far off to\r\nwestward did a little patch of dull blue show; and even this was\r\nclosing up with singular rapidity. And, though the motion of the\r\nmachine made this hard to estimate, Stern thought to see by the\r\nlateral drift of the country below, that they were being carried\r\nwestward by what--to judge from the agitation of the tree-tops far\r\nbelow--must already be a considerable gale.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the engineer cursed his foolhardiness in having started\r\nin face of such a storm as now every moment threatened to break upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"I should have known,\" he told himself, \"that it was suicidal to\r\nattempt a flight when every indication showed a high wind coming. My\r\ninfernal impatience, as usual! We should have stayed safe in\r\nProvidence and let this blow itself out, before starting. But\r\nnow--well, it's too late.\"\r\n\r\nBut was it? Had he not time enough left to make a wide sweep and\r\ncircle back whence he had come? He glanced at the girl. If she showed\r\nfear he would return. But on her face he saw no signs of aught but\r\nconfidence and joy and courage. And at sight of her, his own\r\nresolution strengthened once again.\r\n\r\n\"Why retreat?\" he pondered, holding the machine to her long soaring\r\nrise. \"We must have made a good third of the distance already--perhaps\r\na half. In ten or fifteen minutes more we ought to sight the blue of\r\nthe big bay. No use in turning back now. And as for alighting and\r\nletting the storm blow over, that's impossible. Among these forests it\r\nwould mean only total wreckage. Even if we could land, we never could\r\nstart again. No; the only thing to do is to hold her to it and plow\r\nthrough, storm or no storm. I guess the good old Pauillac can stand\r\nthe racket, right enough!\"\r\n\r\nThus for a few moments longer he held the plane with her nose to the\r\nnortheast-by-north, his compass giving him direction, while far, far\r\nbelow, the world slid back and away in a vast green carpet of swaying\r\ntrees that stretched to the dim, dun horizon.\r\n\r\nStern could never afterward recall exactly how or when the hurricane\r\nstruck them. So stunning was the blow that hurled itself, shrieking,\r\nin a tumult of mad cross-currents, air maelstroms and frenzied whirls,\r\nall across the sky; so overpowering the chill tempest that burst from\r\nthose inky clouds; so sudden the darkness that fell, the slinging hail\r\nvolleys that lashed and pelted them, that any clear perception of\r\ntheir plight became impossible.\r\n\r\nAll the man knew was that direction and control had been knocked clean\r\nfrom his hands; that the world had suddenly vanished in a black drive\r\nof cloud and hail and wild-whipping vapor; that he no longer knew\r\nnorth from south, or east from west; but that--struggling now even to\r\nbreathe, filled with sick fears for the safety of the girl beside\r\nhim--he was fighting, wrenching, wrestling with the motor and the\r\nplanes and rudders, to keep the machine from up-ending, from turning\r\nturtle in mid-air, from sticking her nose under an air-layer and\r\nswooping, hurtling over and over, down, down, like a shattered rocket,\r\nto dash herself to pieces on the waiting earth below.\r\n\r\nThe first furious onset showed the engineer he could not hope to head\r\nup into that cyclone and live. He swung with it, therefore; and now,\r\ndriving across the sky like a filament of cloud-wrack, rode on the\r\ncrest of the great storm, his motor screaming its defiance at the\r\nshrieking wind.\r\n\r\nDid Beatrice shout out to him? Did she try to make him hear? He could\r\nnot tell. No human voice could have been audible in such a turmoil.\r\nStern had no time to think even of her at such a moment of deadly\r\nperil.\r\n\r\nAs a driver with a runaway stallion jerks and saws and strains upon\r\nthe leather to regain control, so now the man wrestled with his\r\nstorm-buffeted machine. A less expert aeronaut must have gone down to\r\ndeath in that mad nexus of conflicting currents; but Stern was cool\r\nand full of craft and science. Against the blows of the huge tempest\r\nhe pitted his own skill, the strength of the stout mechanism, the\r\ntrained instincts of the born mechanician.\r\n\r\nAnd, storm-driven, the biplane hurtled westward, ever westward,\r\nthrough the gloom. Nor could its two passengers by any sight or sound\r\ndetermine what speed they traveled at, whither they went, what lay\r\nbehind, or what ahead.\r\n\r\nConcepts of time, too, vanished. Did it last one hour or three? Five\r\nhours, or even more? Who could tell? Lacking any point of contact with\r\nreality, merged and whelmed in that stupendous chill nightmare, all\r\nwrought of savage gale, rain, hail-blasts, cloud and scudding vapor,\r\nthey sensed nothing but the fight for life itself, the struggle to\r\nkeep aloft till the cyclone should have blown itself out, and they\r\ncould seek the shelter of the earth once more.\r\n\r\nReality came back with a reft in the jetty sky, the faint shine of a\r\nlittle pale blue there, and--a while later--a glimpse of water, or\r\nwhat seemed to be such, very far below.\r\n\r\nMore steady now the currents grew. Stern volplaned again; and as the\r\nmachine slid down toward earth, came into a calmer and more peaceful\r\nstratum.\r\n\r\nDown, down through clouds that shifted, shredded and reassembled, he\r\nlet the plane coast, now under control once more; and all at once\r\nthere below him, less than three thousand feet beneath, he saw, dim\r\nand vague as though in the light of evening, a vast sheet of water\r\nthat stretched away, away, till the sight lost it in a bank of\r\nlow-hung vapors on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"_The sea?_\" thought Stern, with sudden terror. Who could tell?\r\nPerhaps the storm, westbound, had veered; perhaps it might have\r\ncarried them off the Atlantic coast! This might be the ocean, a\r\nhundred or two hundred miles from land. And if so, then good-by!\r\n\r\nChecking the descent, he drove forward on level wings, peering below\r\nwith wide eyes, while far above him the remnants of the storm fled,\r\nrouted, and let a shaft of pallid sunlight through.\r\n\r\nStern's eye caught the light of that setting beam, which still reached\r\nthat height, though all below, on earth, was dusk; and now he knew the\r\nwest again and found his sense of direction.\r\n\r\nThe wind, he perceived, still blew to westward; and with a thrill of\r\nrelief he felt, as though by intuition, that its course had not varied\r\nenough to drive him out to sea.\r\n\r\nThough he knew the ripping clatter of the engine drowned his voice, he\r\nshouted to the girl:\r\n\r\n\"Don't be alarmed! Only a lake down there!\" and with fresh courage\r\ngave the motor all that she would stand.\r\n\r\nA lake! But what lake? What sheet of water, of this size, lay in New\r\nEngland? And if not in New England, then where were they?\r\n\r\nA lake? One of the Great Lakes? Could that be? Could they have been\r\ndriven clear across Massachusetts, its whole length, and over New York\r\nState, four hundred miles or more from the sea, and now be speeding\r\nover Erie or Ontario?\r\n\r\nStern shuddered at the thought. Almost as well be lost over the sea as\r\nover any one of these tremendous bodies! Were not the land near,\r\nnothing but death now faced them; for already the fuel-gage showed but\r\na scant two gallons, and who could say how long the way might be to\r\nshore?\r\n\r\nFor a moment the engineer lost heart, but only for a moment.\r\n\r\nHis eye, sweeping the distance, caught sight of a long, dull, dark\r\nline on the horizon.\r\n\r\nA cloud-bank, was it? Land, was it? He could not tell.\r\n\r\n\"I'll chance it, anyhow,\" thought he, \"for it's our only hope now.\r\nWhen I don't know where I am, one direction's as good as any other.\r\nWe've got no other chance but that! Here goes!\"\r\n\r\nSkilfully banking, he hauled the plane about, and settled on a long,\r\nswift slant toward the dark line.\r\n\r\n\"If only the alcohol holds out, and nothing breaks!\" his thought was.\r\n\"If only that's the shore, and we can reach it in time!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nWESTWARD HO!\r\n\r\n\r\nFate meant that they should live, those two lone wanderers on\r\nthe face of the great desolation; and, though night had gathered now\r\nand all was cloaked in gloom, they landed with no worse than a hard\r\nshake-up on a level strip of beach that edged the confines of the\r\nunknown lake.\r\n\r\nExhausted by the strain and the long fight with death, chilled by that\r\nsojourn in the upper air, drenched and stiffened and half dead, they\r\nhad no strength to make a camp.\r\n\r\nThe most that they could do was drag themselves down to the water's\r\nedge and--finding the water fresh, not salt--drink deeply from\r\nhollowed palms. Then, too worn-out even to eat, they crawled under the\r\nshelter of the biplane's ample wings, and dropped instantly into the\r\nlong and dreamless sleep of utter weariness.\r\n\r\nMid-morning found them, still lame and stiff but rested, cooking\r\nbreakfast over a cheery fire on the beach near the machine. Save for\r\nhere and there a tree that had blown down in the forest, some dead\r\nbranches scattered on the sands, and a few washed-out places where the\r\ntorrent of yesterday's rain had gullied the earth, nature once more\r\nseemed fair and calm.\r\n\r\nThe full force of the terrific wind-storm had probably passed to\r\nnorthward; this land where they now found themselves--whatever it\r\nmight be--had doubtless borne only a small part of the attack. But\r\neven so, and even through the sky gleamed clear and blue and sunlit\r\nonce again, Stern and the girl knew the hurricane had been no ordinary\r\ntempest.\r\n\r\n\"It must have been a cyclone, nothing less,\" judged the engineer, as\r\nhe finished his meal and reached for his comforting pipe. \"And God\r\nknows where it's driven us to! So far as judging distances goes, in a\r\nhurricane like that it's impossible. This may be any one of the Great\r\nLakes; and, again, it may not. For all we know, we may be up in the\r\nHudson Bay region somewhere. This may be Winnipeg, Athabasca, or Great\r\nSlave. With the kind of storms that happen nowadays, anything's\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing matters, after all,\" the girl assured him, \"except that we're\r\nalive and unhurt; and the machine can still travel, for--\"\r\n\r\n\"Travel!\" cried Stern. \"With about a quart of fuel or less! How far,\r\nI'd like to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so; I never thought of that!\" the girl replied, dismayed. \"Oh,\r\ndear, what shall we do now?\"\r\n\r\nStern laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Hunt for a town, of course,\" he reassured her. \"There, there, don't\r\nworry! If we find alcohol, we're all right, anyhow. If not, we're\r\nbetter off than we were after the maelstrom almost got us, at any\r\nrate. Then we had no arms, ammunition, tools, or means to make fire,\r\nwhile now we've got them all. Forgive my speaking as I did, little\r\ngirl. Don't worry--everything will come right in the end.\"\r\n\r\nReassured, she sat before the fire, and for an hour or more they drew\r\nmaps and diagrams in the sand, made plans, and laid out their next\r\nstep in this long campaign against the savage power of a deserted\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAt last, their minds made up, they wheeled the plane back to the\r\nforest, where Stern cut out among the trees a space for its\r\nprotection. And, leaving it here, covered with branches of the\r\nthick-topped fern-tree, they took provisions and once more set out on\r\ntheir exploration.\r\n\r\nBut this time they had an ax and their two rifles, and as they strode\r\nnorthward along the shore they felt a match for any peril.\r\n\r\nAn hour's walk brought them to the ruins of a steel recreation-pier,\r\nwith numerous traces of a town along the lake behind it.\r\n\r\n\"That settles the Hudson Bay theory,\" Stern rejoiced, as they wandered\r\namong the debris. \"This is certainly one of the Great Lakes, though\r\nwhich one, of course, we can't tell as yet. And now if we can round up\r\nsome alcohol we'll be on our way before very long.\"\r\n\r\nThey found no alcohol, for the only ruin where drugs or liquors had\r\nevidently been sold had caved in, a mass of shattered brickwork,\r\nsmashing every bottle in the place. Stern found many splintered shards\r\nof glass; but that was all, so far as fuel was concerned. He\r\ndiscovered something else, however, that proved of tremendous\r\nvalue--the wreck of a printing-office.\r\n\r\nPresses and iron of all kind had gone to pieces, but some of the\r\nlarger lead types and quads still were recognizable. And, the crucial\r\nthing, he turned up a jagged bit of stereotype-sheet from under the\r\nprotection of a concrete plinth that had fallen into the cellar.\r\n\r\nAll corroded and discolored though it was, he still could make out a\r\nfew letters.\r\n\r\n\"A newspaper head, so help me!\" he exclaimed, as with a trembling\r\nfinger he pointed the letters out to Beatrice: \"Here's an 'H'--here's\r\n'mbur'--here's 'aily,' and 'ronicl'! Eh, what? 'Chronicle,' it must\r\nhave been! By Jove, you're right! And the whole thing used to spell\r\n'Hamburg Daily Chronicle,' or I'm a liar!\"\r\n\r\nHe thought a moment--thought hard--then burst out:\r\n\r\n\"Hamburg, eh? Hamburg, by a big lake? Well, the only Hamburg by a lake\r\nthat I know of used to be Hamburg, New York. I ought to remember. I\r\ndrew the plans for the New York Central bridge, just north of here,\r\nover the Spring Creek ravine.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, this certainly is Hamburg, New York. And this lake must be\r\nErie. Now, if I'm correct, just back up there on that hill we'll find\r\nthe remains of the railway cut, and less than ten miles north of here\r\nlies all that's left of Buffalo. Some luck, eh? Cast away, only\r\nfifteen miles or so from a place like that. And we might have gone to\r\nGreat Bear Lake, or to--h-m!--to any other place, for all the cyclone\r\ncared.\r\n\r\n\"Well, come on now, let's see if the railway cut is still there, and\r\nmy old bridge; and if so, it's Buffalo for ours!\"\r\n\r\nIt was all as he had said. The right-of-way of the railroad still\r\nshowed distinctly, in spite of the fact that ties and rails had long\r\nsince vanished. Of the bridge nothing was left but some rusted steel\r\nstringers lying entangled about the disintegrated concrete piers. But\r\nStern viewed them with a melancholy pride and interest--his own\r\nhandiwork in the very long ago.\r\n\r\nThey had no time, however, for retrospection; but, once more taking\r\nthe shore, kept steadily northward. And before noon they reached the\r\ndebris of Buffalo, stark and deserted by the lake where once its busy\r\ncommerce and its noisy life had thronged. By four o'clock that\r\nafternoon they had collected fuel enough for the plane to do that\r\ndistance on, and more. Late that night they were again back at the\r\nspot where they had landed the night before.\r\n\r\nAnd here, in high spirits and with every hope of better fortune now to\r\nfollow evil, they cooked their meal and spent an hour in planning\r\ntheir next move, then slept the sleep of well-earned rest.\r\n\r\nThey had now decided to abandon the idea of visiting Boston. This\r\nseeming change of front was not without its good reasons.\r\n\r\n\"We're half-way to Chicago as it is,\" Stern summed up next morning.\r\n\"Conditions are probably similar all along the Atlantic coast; there's\r\nno life to be found there: On the other hand, if we strike for the\r\nWest there's at least a chance of running across survivors. If we\r\ndon't find them there, then we probably sha'n't find them anywhere. In\r\nChicago we can live and restock for further explorations, and as for\r\nlocating a telescope, the University of Chicago ruins are as promising\r\nas those of Harvard. Chicago, by all means!\"\r\n\r\nThey set out at nine o'clock, and, having made a good start, reached\r\nBuffalo by twenty minutes past, flying easily along the shore at not\r\nmore than five hundred feet elevation.\r\n\r\nGaily the lake sparkled and wimpled in the morning sun, unvexed now by\r\nany steamer's prow, unshaded by any smoke from cities or roaring mills\r\nalong its banks.\r\n\r\nDespite the lateness of the season, the morning was warm; a mild\r\nbreeze swayed the treetops and set the little whitecaps foaming here\r\nand there over the broad expanse of blue. Beatrice and Stern felt the\r\njoy of life reborn in them at that sight.\r\n\r\n\"Magnificent!\" cried the engineer. \"Now for a swing up past Niagara,\r\nand we're off!\"\r\n\r\nThe river, they found as the plane swept onward, had dwindled to a\r\nbrook that they could almost leap across. The rapids now were but a\r\ndreary waste of blackened rocks, and the Falls themselves, dry save\r\nfor a desolate trickle down past Goat Island, presented a spectacle of\r\ndeath--the death of the world as Beatrice and Stern had known it,\r\nwhich depressed them both.\r\n\r\nThat this tremendous cataract could vanish thus; that the gorge and\r\nthe great Falls which for uncounted centuries had thundered to the\r\nrush and tumult of the mighty waters could now lie mute and dry and\r\nlifeless, saddened them both beyond measure.\r\n\r\nAnd they were glad when, with a wide sweep of her wings, the Pauillac\r\nveered to westward again along the north shore of Lake Erie and\r\nsettled into the long run of close on two hundred and fifty miles to\r\nDetroit, where Stern counted on making his first stop.\r\n\r\nWithout mishap, yet without sighting a single indication of the\r\npresence of man, they coasted down the shore and ate their dinner on\r\nthe banks of Lake Saint Clair, near the ruins of Windsor, with those\r\nof Detroit on the opposite side. For some reason or other, impossible\r\nto solve, the current now ran northward toward Huron, instead of south\r\nto Erie. But this phenomenon they could do little more than merely\r\nnote, for time lacked to give it any serious study.\r\n\r\nMid-afternoon found them getting under way again westbound.\r\n\r\n\"Chicago next,\" said Stern, making some slight but necessary\r\nadjustment of the air-feed in the carburetor. \"And here's hoping\r\nthere'll be some natives to greet us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen to that!\" answered the girl. \"If any life has survived at all,\r\nit ought to be on the great central plain of the country, say from\r\nIndiana out through Nebraska. But do you know, Allan, if it should\r\ncome right down to meeting any of our own kind of people--savages, of\r\ncourse, I mean, but white--I really believe I'd be awfully afraid of\r\nthem. Imagine white savages dressed in skins--\"\r\n\r\n\"Like us!\" interrupted Stern, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"And painted with woad, whatever woad is; I remember reading about it\r\nin the histories of England; all the early Britons used it. And\r\ncarrying nice, knobby stone creeks to stave in our heads! It _would_\r\nbe nice to meet a hundred or a thousand of them, eh? Rather a\r\ndifferent matter from dealing with a horde of those anthropoid\r\ncreatures, I imagine.\"\r\n\r\nStern only smiled, then answered:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll take _my_ chances with 'em. Better a fight, say I, with my\r\nown kind, than solitude like this--you and I all alone, girl, getting\r\nold some time and dying with never a hand-clasp save perhaps such as\r\nit may please fate to give us from whatever children are to be. But\r\ncome, come, girl. No time for gloomy speculations of trouble. In you\r\nget now, and off we go--westward bound again.\"\r\n\r\nOnly half an hour out of Detroit it was that they first became aware\r\nof some strange disturbance of the horizon, some inexplicable\r\nappearance such as neither of them had ever seen, a phenomenon so\r\npeculiar that, though both observed it at about the same time, neither\r\nStern could believe his own senses nor Beatrice hers.\r\n\r\nFor all at once it seemed to them the sky-line was drawing suddenly\r\nnearer; it seemed that the horizon was approaching at high speed.\r\n\r\nThe dark, untrodden forest mass still stretched away, away, until it\r\nvanished against the dim blue of the sky; but now, instead of that\r\nmeeting-line being forty miles off, it seemed no farther than twenty,\r\nand minute by minute it indubitably was rushing toward them with a\r\nspeed equal to their own.\r\n\r\nStern, puzzled and alarmed at this unusual sight, felt an impulse to\r\nslow, to swerve, to test the apparition in some way; but second\r\nthought convinced him it must be deception of some sort.\r\n\r\n\"Some peculiar state of the atmosphere,\" thought he, \"or perhaps we're\r\napproaching a high ridge, on the other side of which lie clouds that\r\ncut away the farther view. Or else--no, hang it! the world seems to\r\nend right there, with no clouds to veil it--nothing, only--what?\"\r\n\r\nHe saw the girl pointing in alarm. She, too, was clearly stirred by\r\nthe appearance.\r\n\r\nWhat to do? Stern felt indecision for the first time since he had\r\nstarted on this long, adventurous journey. Shut off and descend?\r\nImpossible among those forests. Swing about and return? Not to be\r\nthought of. Keep on and meet perils perhaps undreamed of? Yes--at all\r\nhazards he would keep on.\r\n\r\nAnd with a tightening of the jaw he drove the Pauillac onward, ever\r\nonward--toward the empty space that yawned ahead.\r\n\r\n\"End o' the world?\" thought he. \"All right, the old machine is good\r\nfor it, and so are we. Here goes!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nON THE LIP OF THE CHASM\r\n\r\n\r\nVery near, now, was the strange apparition. On, on, swift as a\r\nfalcon, the plane hurtled. Stern glanced at Beatrice. Never had he\r\nseen her more beautiful. About her face, rosy and full of life, the\r\nluxuriant loose hair was whipping. Her eyes sparkled with this new\r\nexcitement, and on her full red lips a smile betrayed her keen\r\nenjoyment. No trace of fear was there--nothing but confidence and\r\nstrength and joy in the adventure.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of the world's end--for nothing else describes it\r\nadequately--now appeared distinctly as a jagged line, beyond which\r\nnothing showed. It differed from the horizon line, inasmuch as it was\r\nclose at hand. Already the adventurers could peer down upon it at an\r\nacute angle.\r\n\r\nPlainly could they see the outlines of trees growing along the verge.\r\nBut beyond them, nothing.\r\n\r\nIt differed essentially from a canyon, because there was no other side\r\nat all. Strain his eye as he might, Stern could detect no opposite\r\nwall. And now, realizing something of the possibilities of such a\r\nchasm, he swung the Pauillac southward. Flying parallel to the edge of\r\nthis tremendous barrier, he sought to solve the mystery of its true\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\"If I go higher, perhaps I may be able to get some notion of it,\"\r\nthought he, and swinging up-wind, he spiraled till the barometer\r\nshowed he had gained another thousand feet.\r\n\r\nBut even this additional view profited him nothing. Half a mile to\r\nwestward the ragged tree-line still showed as before, with vacancy\r\nbehind it, and as far as Stern could see to north, to south, it\r\nstretched away till the dim blue of distance swallowed it. Yet,\r\nstraight across the gulf, no land appeared. Only the sky itself was\r\nvisible there, as calm and as unbroken as in the zenith, yet extending\r\nfar below where the horizon-line should have been--down, in fact, to\r\nwhere the tree-line cut it off from Stern's vision.\r\n\r\nThe effect was precisely that of coming to the edge of a vast plain,\r\nbeyond which nothing lay, save space, and peering over.\r\n\r\n\"The end of the world, indeed!\" thought the engineer, despite himself.\r\n\"But what can it mean? What can have happened to the sphere to have\r\nchanged it like this? Good Heavens, what a marvel--what a\r\ncatastrophe!\"\r\n\r\nDetermined at all hazards to know more of this titanic break or\r\n\"fault,\" or whatsoever it might be, he banked again, and now, on a\r\ndescending slant, veered down toward the lip of the chasm.\r\n\r\n\"Going out over it?\" cried Beatrice.\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"It may be miles deep!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't get killed any deader falling a hundred miles than you can\r\na hundred feet!\" he shouted back, above the droning racket of the\r\nmotor.\r\n\r\nAnd with a fresh grip on the wheel, head well forward, every sense\r\nalert and keen to meet whatever conditions might arise, to battle with\r\ncross-currents, \"air-holes,\" or any other vortices swirling up out of\r\nthose unknown depths, he skimmed the Pauillac fair toward the lip of\r\nthe monstrous vacancy.\r\n\r\nNow as they rushed almost above the verge he could see conclusively\r\nthey were not dealing here with a canyon like the Yosemite or like any\r\nother he had ever seen or heard of in the old days.\r\n\r\nThere was positively no bottom to the terrific thing!\r\n\r\nJust a sheer edge and beyond that--nothing.\r\n\r\nNowhere any sign of an opposite bank; nowhere the faintest trace of\r\nland. Far, far below, even a few faint clouds showed floating there as\r\nif in mid-heaven.\r\n\r\nThe effect was ghastly, unnerving and altogether terrible. Not that\r\nStern feared height. No, it was the unreality of the experience, the\r\ninexplicable character of this yawning edge of the world that almost\r\novercame him.\r\n\r\nOnly by a strong exercise of will-power could he hold the biplane to\r\nher course. His every instinct was to veer, to retreat back to solid\r\nearth, and land somewhere, and once more, at all hazards, get the\r\ncontact of reality.\r\n\r\nBut Stern resisted all these impulses, and now already had driven the\r\nPauillac right to the lip of the vast nothingness.\r\n\r\nNow they were over!\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" he cried, stunned by the realization of this thing. \"Sheer\r\nspace! No bottom anywhere!\"\r\n\r\nFor all at once they had shot, as it were, out into a void which\r\nseemed to hold no connection at all with the earth they now were\r\nquitting.\r\n\r\nStern caught a glimpse of the tall forest growing up to within a\r\nhundred yards of the edge, then of smaller trees, dwindling to bushes\r\nand grasses, and strange red sand that bordered the gap--sand and\r\nrocks, barren as though some up-draft from the void had killed off\r\nvegetable growth along the very brink.\r\n\r\nThen all slid back and away. The red-ribbed wall of the great chasm,\r\nshattered and broken as by some inconceivable disaster, some cosmic\r\ncataclysm, fell away and away, downward, dimmer and more dim, until it\r\nfaded gradually into a blue haze, then vanished utterly.\r\n\r\nAnd there below lay nothingness--and nothingness stretched out in\r\nfront to where the sight lost itself in pearly vapors that overdimmed\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nBeatrice glanced at Stern as the Pauillac sped true as an arrow in its\r\nflight, out into this strange and incomprehensible vacuity.\r\n\r\nJust a shade paler now he seemed. Despite the keen wind, a glister of\r\nsweat-drops studded his forehead. His jaw was set, set hard; she could\r\nsee the powerful maxillary muscles knotted there where the\r\nthroat-cords met the angle of the bone. And she understood that, for\r\nthe first time since their tremendous adventure had begun, the man\r\nfelt shaken by this latest and greatest of all the mysteries they had\r\nbeen called upon to face.\r\n\r\nAlready the verge lay far behind; and now the sense of empty space\r\nabove and on all sides and there below was overpowering.\r\n\r\nStern gasped with a peculiar choking sound. Then all at once, throwing\r\nthe front steering plane at an angle, he brought the machine about and\r\nheaded for the distant land.\r\n\r\nHe spoke no word, nor did she; but they both swept the edge of the\r\nchasm with anxious eyes, seeking a place to light.\r\n\r\nIt was with tremendous relief that they both saw the solid earth once\r\nmore below them. And when, five minutes later, having chosen a clear\r\nand sand-barren on the verge, some two miles southward along the\r\nabyss, Stern brought the machine to earth, they felt a gratitude and a\r\nrelief not to be voiced in words.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" exclaimed the man, lifting Beatrice from the seat, \"if that\r\nisn't enough to shake a man's nerve and upset all his ideas,\r\ngeological or otherwise, I'd like to know what is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Going to try to cross it?\" she asked anxiously; \"that is, if there is\r\nany other side? I know, of course, that if there is you'll find out,\r\nsome way or other!\"\r\n\r\n\"You overestimate me,\" he replied. \"All I can do, for now, is to camp\r\ndown here and try to figure the problem out--with your help. Whatever\r\nthis thing is, it's evident it stands between us and our plan. Either\r\nChicago lies on the other side--(provided, of course, as you say, that\r\nthere is one)--or else it's been swallowed up, ages ago, by whatever\r\ncatastrophe produced this yawning gulf.\r\n\r\n\"In either event we've got to try to discover the truth, and act\r\naccordingly. But for now, there's nothing we can do. It's getting late\r\nalready. We've had enough for one day, little girl. Come on, let's\r\nmake the machine ready for the night, and camp down here and have a\r\nbite to eat. Perhaps by to-morrow we may know just what we're up\r\nagainst!\"\r\n\r\nThe moon had risen, flooding the world with spectral light, before\r\nthe two adventurers had finished their meal. All during it they had\r\nkept an unusual silence. The presence of that terrible gulf, there not\r\ntwo hundred feet away to westward of them, imposed its awe upon their\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nAnd after the meal was done, by tacit understanding they refrained\r\nfrom trying to approach it or to peer over. Too great the risks by\r\nnight. They spoke but little, and presently exhausted by the trying\r\nevents of the day--sought sleep under the vanes of the Pauillac.\r\n\r\nBut for an hour, tired as he was, the engineer lay thinking of the\r\nchasm, trying in vain to solve its problem or to understand how they\r\nwere to follow any further the search for the ruins of Chicago, where\r\nfuel was to be had, or carry on the work of trying to find some living\r\nmembers of the human race.\r\n\r\nMorning found them revived and strengthened. Even before they made\r\ntheir fire or prepared their breakfast they were exploring along the\r\nedge of the gigantic cleft.\r\n\r\nGoing first to make sure no rock should crumble under the girl's\r\ntread, no danger threaten, Stern tested every foot of the way to the\r\nvery edge of the sheer chasm.\r\n\r\n\"Slowly, now!\" he cautioned, taking her hand. \"We've got to be careful\r\nhere. My God, what a drop!\"\r\n\r\nAwed, despite themselves, they stood there on a flat slab of schist\r\nthat projected boldly over the void. Seen from this point, the immense\r\nnothingness opened out below them even more terrible than it had\r\nseemed from the biplane.\r\n\r\nThe fact is common knowledge that a height, viewed from a balloon or\r\naeroplane, is always far less dizzying than from a lofty building or a\r\nmonument. Giddiness vanishes when no solid support lies under the\r\nfeet. This fact Stern and the girl appreciated to the full as they\r\npeered over the edge. Ten times more ominous and frightful the vast\r\nblue mystery beneath them now appeared than it had seemed before.\r\n\r\n\"Let's look sheer down,\" said the girl. \"By lying flat and peering\r\nover, there can't be any danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, but only on condition that I keep tight hold of you!\"\r\n\r\nCautiously they lay down and worked their way to the edge. The\r\nengineer circled Beta's supple waist with his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Steady, now!\" he warned. \"When you feel giddy, let me know, and we'll\r\ngo back.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of the chasm, from the very edge of the rock, was\r\nterrifying. It was like nothing ever seen by human eyes. Peering down\r\ninto the Grand Canyon of the Colorado would have been child's play\r\nbeside it. For this was no question of looking down a half-mile, a\r\nmile, or even five, to some solid bottom.\r\n\r\nBottom there was none--nothing save dull purple haze, shifting vapors,\r\nand an unearthly dim light which seemed to radiate upward as though\r\nthe sun's rays, reflected, were striving to beat up again.\r\n\r\n\"There must be miles and miles of air below us,\" said Stern, \"to\r\naccount for this curious light-effect. Air, of course, will eventually\r\ncut off the vision. Given a sufficiently thick layer, say a few\r\nhundred miles, it couldn't be seen through. So if there _is_ a bottom\r\nto this place, be it one hundred or even five hundred miles down, of\r\ncourse we couldn't see it. All we could see would be the air, which\r\nwould give this sort of blue effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but in that case how can we see the sun, or the moon, or stars?\"\r\n\r\n\"Light from above only has to pierce forty or fifty miles of really\r\ndense air. Above that height it's excessively rarified. While down\r\nbelow earth-level, of course, it would get more and more dense all the\r\ntime, till at the bottom of a five-hundred-mile drop the density and\r\npressure would be tremendous.\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice made no answer. The spectacle she was gazing at filled her\r\nwith solemn thoughts. Jagged, rent and riven, the rock extended\r\ndownward. Here vast and broken ledges ran along its flanks--red,\r\nyellow, black, all seared and burned and vitrified as by the fire of\r\nHell; there huge masses, up-piled, seemed about to fall into the\r\nabyss.\r\n\r\nA quarter-mile to southward, a rivulet had found its way over a\r\nprojecting ledge. Spraying and silvery it fell, till, dissipated by\r\nthe up-draft from the abyss, it dissolved in mist.\r\n\r\nThe ledge on which they were lying extended downward perhaps three\r\nhundred yards, then sloped backward, leaving sheer empty space beneath\r\nthem. They seemed to be poised in mid-heaven. It was totally unlike\r\nthe sensation on a mountain-top, or even floating among the clouds;\r\nfor a moment it seemed to Stern that he was looking up toward an\r\nunfathomable, infinite dome above him.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered, despite his cool and scientific spirit of observation.\r\n\r\n\"Some chemical action going on somewhere down there,\" said he, half to\r\ndivert his own attention from his thoughts. \"Smell that sulphur? If\r\nthis place wasn't once the scene of volcanic activities, I'm no\r\njudge!\"\r\n\r\nA moderate yet very steady wind blew upward from the chasm, freighted\r\nwith a scent of sulphur and some other substance new to Stern.\r\n\r\nBeatrice, all at once overcome by sudden giddiness, drew back and hid\r\nher face in both hands.\r\n\r\n\"No bottom to it--no end!\" she said in a scared tone. \"Here's the end\r\nof the world, right here, and beyond this very rock--nothing!\"\r\n\r\nStern, puzzled, shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"That's really impossible, absurd and ridiculous, of course,\" he\r\nanswered. \"There _must_ be something beyond. The way this stone falls\r\nproves that.\"\r\n\r\nHe pitched a two-pound lump of granite far out into the air. It fell\r\nvertically, whirling, and vanished with the speed of a meteor.\r\n\r\n\"If a whole side of the earth had split off, and what we see down\r\nbelow there were really sky, of course the earth's center of gravity\r\nwould have shifted,\" he explained, \"and that rock would have fallen in\r\ntoward the cliff below us, not straight down.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you be sure it doesn't fall that way after the impulse you\r\ngave it has been lost?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall have to make some close scientific tests here, lasting a day\r\nor two, before I'm positive; but my impression is that this, after\r\nall, is only a canyon--a split in the surface--rather than an actual\r\nend of the crust.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if it were a canyon, why should blue sky show down there at an\r\nangle of forty-five degrees?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to think that out, later,\" he replied. \"Directly under us,\r\nyou see all seems deep purple. That's another fact to consider. I tell\r\nyou, Beatrice, there's more to be figured out here than can be done in\r\nhalf an hour.\r\n\r\n\"As I see it, some vast catastrophe must have rent the earth, a\r\nthousand or fifteen hundred years ago, as a result of which everybody\r\nwas killed except you and me. We're standing now on the edge of the\r\nscar left by that explosion, or whatever it was. How deep or how wide\r\nthat scar is, I don't know. Everything depends on our finding out, or\r\nat least on our guessing it with some degree of accuracy.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, don't you see, this chasm stands between us and Chicago and\r\nthe West, and all our hopes of finding human life there. And--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not coast south along the edge here, and see if we can't run\r\nacross some ruined city or other where we can refill the tanks?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll think it over,\" the engineer answered. \"In the meantime we can\r\ncamp down here a couple of days or so, and rest; and I can make some\r\ncalculations with a pendulum and so on.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if you decide there's probably another side to this gulf, what\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"We cross,\" he said; then for a while stood silent, musing as he\r\npeered down into the bottomless abyss that stretched there hungrily\r\nbeneath their narrow observation-rock.\r\n\r\n\"We cross, that's all!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nLOST IN THE GREAT ABYSS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two days they camped beside the chasm, resting, planning,\r\ndiscussing, while Stern, with improvised transits, pendulums and other\r\napparatus, made tests and observations to determine, if possible, the\r\nproperties of the great gap.\r\n\r\nDuring this time they developed some theories regarding the\r\ncatastrophe which had swept the world a thousand years ago.\r\n\r\n\"It seems highly and increasingly probable to me,\" the engineer said,\r\nafter long thought, \"that we have here the actual cause of the vast\r\nblight of death that left us two alone in the world. I rather think\r\nthat at the time of the great explosion which produced this rent,\r\ncertain highly poisonous gases were thrown off, to impregnate the\r\nentire atmosphere of the world. Everybody must have been killed at\r\nonce. The poison must have swept the earth clean of human life.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did _we_ escape?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"That's hard telling. I figure it this way: The mephitic gas probably\r\nwas heavy and dense, thus keeping to the lower air-strata, following\r\nthem, over plain and hill and mountain, like a blanket of death.\r\n\r\n\"Just what happened to us, who can tell? Probably, tightly housed up\r\nthere in the tower, the very highest inhabited spot in the world, only\r\na very slight infiltration of the gas reached us. If my theory won't\r\nwork, can you suggest a better one? Frankly, I can't; and until we\r\nhave more facts, we've got to take what we have. No matter, the\r\ncondition remains--we're alive and all the rest are dead; and I'm\r\npositive this cleft here is the cause of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if everybody's dead, as you say, why hunt for men?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps a handful may have survived among the highlands of the\r\nRockies. I imagine that after the first great explosion there followed\r\na series of terrible storms, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, tidal\r\nwaves and so on. You remember how I found the bones of a whale in\r\nlower Broadway; and many of the ruins in New York show the action of\r\nthe sea--they're laid flat in such a manner as to indicate that the\r\nisland was washed on one or two occasions by monster waves.\r\n\r\n\"Well, all these disturbances probably finished up what few survivors\r\nescaped, except possibly among the mountains of the West. A few\r\nscattered colonies may have survived a while--mining camps, for\r\ninstance, or isolated prospectors, or what-not. They may all have died\r\nout, or again, they may have come together and reestablished some\r\nprimitive form of barbarous or even savage life by this time. There's\r\nno telling. Our imperative problem is to reach that section and\r\nexplore it thoroughly. For there, if anywhere, we'll find survivors of\r\nour race.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about that great maelstrom that nearly got us?\" asked the girl.\"\r\nCan you connect that with the catastrophe?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so. My idea is that, in some way or other, the sea is being\r\nsucked down into the interior of the earth and then hurled out again;\r\nmaybe there's a gradual residue being left; maybe a great central lake\r\nor sea has formed. Who knows? At any rate all the drainage system of\r\nthe country seems to have been changed and reversed in the most\r\ncurious and unaccountable manner. I think we should find, if we could\r\ninvestigate everything thoroughly, that this vast chasm here is\r\nintimately connected with the whole thing.\"\r\n\r\nThese and many other questions perplexed the travelers, but most of\r\nall they sought to know the breadth of the vast gap and to determine\r\nif it had, as they hoped, another side, or if it were indeed the edge\r\nof an enormous mass split bodily off the earth.\r\n\r\nStern believed he had an answer to this problem on the afternoon of\r\nthe second day. For many hours he had hung his pendulums over the\r\ncliff, noted deflections, taken triangulations, and covered the\r\nsurface of the smooth stone with X's, Y's, Z's, sines and cosines and\r\nabstruse formulae--all scrawled with charcoal, his only means of\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nAt last he finished the final equation, and, with a smile of triumph\r\nand relief, got to his feet again.\r\n\r\nBack to the girl, who was cooking over an odorous fire of cedar, he\r\nmade his way, rejoicing.\r\n\r\n\"I've got it!\" he shouted gladly. \"Making reasonable allowances for\r\ndepth, I've got it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Got what?\"\r\n\r\n\"The probable width!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" And she stood gazing at him in admiration, beautiful and strong\r\nand graceful. \"You mean to say--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm giving the chasm a hundred miles' depth. That's more than anybody\r\ncould believe possible--twice as much. On that assumption, my tests\r\nshow the distance to the other side--and there is another side, by the\r\nway!--can't be over--\"\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred miles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! Not over one hundred to one-fifty. I'm going on a liberal\r\nallowance for error, too. It may not be over seventy-five. The--\"\r\n\r\n\"But if that's as far as it is, why can't we see the other side?\"\r\n\r\n\"With all that chemicalized vapor rising constantly? Who knows what\r\nelements may be in it? Or what polarization may be taking place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Polarization?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, what deflection and alteration of light? No wonder we can't\r\nsee! But we can fly! And we're going to, what's more!\"\r\n\r\n\"Going to make a try for Chicago, then?\" she asked, her eyes lighting\r\nup joyfully at thought of the adventure.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow morning, sure!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the alcohol?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've still got what we started with from Detroit, minus only what\r\nwe've burned reaching this place. And we reckoned when we set out that\r\nit would far more than be enough. Oh, that part of it's all right!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know best,\" she answered. \"I trust you in all things,\r\nAllan. But now just look at this roast partridge; come, dear, let\r\nto-morrow take care of itself. It's supper-time now!\"\r\n\r\nAfter the meal they went to the flat rock and sat for an hour while\r\nthe sun went down beyond the void. Its disappearance seemed to\r\nsubstantiate the polarization theory. There was no sudden obliteration\r\nof the disk by a horizon. Rather the sun faded away, redder and\r\nduller; then slowly losing form and so becoming a mere blur of\r\ncrimson, which in turn grew purple and so gradually died away to\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nFor a long time they sat in the deepening gloom, their rifles close at\r\nhand, saying little, but thinking much. The coming of night had\r\nsobered them to a sense of what now inevitably lay ahead. The solemn\r\npurple pall that adumbrated the world and the huge nothingness before\r\nthem, so silent, so immutable and pregnant with terrible mysteries,\r\nbrought them close together.\r\n\r\nThe vague, untrodden forest behind them, where the night-sounds of the\r\nwild dimly reechoed now and then, filled them with indefinable\r\nemotions. And that night sleep was slow in coming.\r\n\r\nEach realized that, despite all calculations and all skill, the morrow\r\nmight be their last day of life. But the morning light, golden and\r\nclear above the eastern sky-line of tall conifers, dispelled all\r\nbrooding fears. They were both up early and astir, in preparation for\r\nthe crucial flight. Stern went over the edge of the chasm, while\r\nBeatrice prepared breakfast, and made some final observations of wind,\r\nair currents and atmosphere density.\r\n\r\nAn eagle which he saw soaring over the abyss, more than half a mile\r\nfrom its edge, convinced him a strong upward current existed to-day,\r\nas on the day when they had made their short flight over the void. The\r\nbird soared and circled and finally shot away to northward, without a\r\nwing-flap, almost in the manner of a vulture. Stern knew an eagle\r\ncould not imitate the feat without some aid in the way of an up-draft.\r\n\r\n\"And if that draft is steady and constant all the way across,\" thought\r\nhe, \"it will result in a big saving of fuel. Given a sufficient rising\r\ncurrent, we could volplane all the way across with a very slight\r\nexpenditure of alcohol. It looks now as though everything were coming\r\non first-rate. Couldn't be better. And what a day for an excursion!\"\r\n\r\nBy nine o'clock all was ready. Along the land a mild south wind was\r\nblowing. Though the day was probably the 5th of October or thereabout,\r\nno signs of autumn yet were blazoned in the forest. The morning was\r\nperfect, and the travelers' spirits rose in unison with the abounding\r\nbeauty of the day.\r\n\r\nStern had given the Pauillac another final going over, tightening the\r\nstays and laterals, screwing up here a loosened nut, there a bolt,\r\nmaking certain all was in perfect order.\r\n\r\nAt nine-fifteen, after he had had a comforting pipe, they made a clean\r\ngetaway, rising along the edge of the chasm, then soaring in huge\r\nspirals.\r\n\r\n\"I want all the altitude I can get,\" Stern shouted at the girl as they\r\nclimbed steadily higher. \"We may need it to coast on. And from a mile\r\nor two up maybe we can get a glimpse of the other side.\"\r\n\r\nBut though they ascended till the aneroid showed eight thousand five\r\nhundred feet, nothing met their gaze but the same pearly blue vapor\r\nwhich veiled the mystery before them. And Stern, satisfied now that\r\nnothing could be gained by any further ascent, turned the machine due\r\nwest, and sent her skimming like a swallow out over the tremendous\r\nnothingness below.\r\n\r\nAs the earth faded behind them they began to feel distinctly a warm\r\nand pungent wind that rose beneath--a steady current, as from some\r\nhuge chimney that lazily was pouring out its monstrous volume of hot\r\nvapors.\r\n\r\nAway and away behind them slid the lip of this gigantic gash across\r\nthe world; and now already with the swift rush of the plane the solid\r\nearth had begun to fade and to grow dim.\r\n\r\nStern only cast a glance at the sun and at his compass, hung there in\r\ngimbals before him, and with firm hand steadied the machine for the\r\nlong problematical flight to westward. Behind them the sun kept even\r\nwith their swift pace; and very far below and ahead, at times they\r\nthought to see the fleeing shadow of the biplane cast now and then on\r\nmasses of formless vapor that rose from the unsounded deeps.\r\n\r\nDefinitely committed now to this tremendous venture, both Stern and\r\nthe girl settled themselves more firmly in their seats. No time to\r\nfeel alarm, no time for introspection, or for thoughts of what might\r\nlie below, what fate theirs must be if the old Pauillac failed them\r\nnow!\r\n\r\nNo time save for confidence in the stout mechanism and in the skill of\r\nhand and brain that was driving the great planes, with a roaring rush\r\nlike a gigantic gull, a swooping rise and fall in long arcs over the\r\nhills of air, across the vast enigma of that space!\r\n\r\nStern's whole attention was fixed on driving, just on the manipulation\r\nof the swift machine. Exhaust and interplay, the rhythm of each\r\nwhirling cam and shaft, the chatter of the cylinders, the droning\r\ndiapason of the blades, all blent into one intricate yet perfect\r\nharmony of mechanism; and as a leader knows each instrument in the\r\ngreat orchestra and follows each, even as his eye reads the score, so\r\nStern's keen ear analyzed each sound and action and reaction and knew\r\nall were in perfect tune and resonance.\r\n\r\nThe machine--no early and experimental model, such as were used in the\r\nfirst days of flying, from 1900 to 1915, but one of the perfected and\r\nself-balancing types developed about 1920, the year when the Great\r\nDeath had struck the world--responded nobly to his skill and care.\r\nFrom her landing-skids to the farthest tip of her ailerons she seemed\r\nalive, instinct with conscious and eager intelligence.\r\n\r\nStern blessed her mentally with special pride and confidence in her\r\nmercury equalizing balances. Proud of his machine and of his skill,\r\nsuperb like Phaeton whirling the sun-chariot across the heavens, he\r\ngave her more and still more speed.\r\n\r\nBelow nothing, nothing save vapors, with here and there an open space\r\nwhere showed the strange dull purple of the abyss. Above, to right, to\r\nleft, nothing--absolute vacant space.\r\n\r\nGone now was all sight of the land that they had left. Unlike\r\nballoonists who always see dense clouds or else the earth, they now\r\nsaw nothing. All alone with the sun that rushed behind them in their\r\nskimming flight, they fled like wraiths across the emptiness of the\r\ngreat void.\r\n\r\nStern glanced at the barometer, and grunted with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"H'm! Twelve thousand four hundred and fifty feet--and I've been\r\njockeying to come down at least five hundred feet already!\" thought\r\nhe. \"How the devil can _that_ be?\"\r\n\r\nThe explanation came to him. But it surprised him almost as much as\r\nthe noted fact.\r\n\r\n\"Must be one devil of a wind blowing up out of that place,\" he\r\npondered, \"to carry us up nearly four thousand feet, when I've been\r\ntrying to descend. Well, it's all right, anyhow--it all helps.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at the spinning anemometer. It registered a speed of\r\nninety-seven miles an hour. Yet now that they were out of sight of any\r\nland, only the rush of the wind and the enormous vibration of the\r\nplane conveyed an idea of motion. They might as well have been hung in\r\nmid-space, like Mohammed's tomb, as have been rushing forward; there\r\nwas no visible means of judging what their motion really might be.\r\n\r\n\"Unique experience in the history of mankind!\" shouted Stern to the\r\ngirl. \"The world's invisible to us.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded and smiled back at him, her white teeth gleaming in the\r\nstrange, bluish light that now enveloped them.\r\n\r\nStern, keenly attentive to the engine, advanced the spark another\r\nnotch, and now the needle crept to 102 1/2.\r\n\r\n\"We'll be across before we know it,\" thought he. \"At this rate, I\r\nshouldn't be surprised to sight land any minute now.\"\r\n\r\nA quarter-hour more the Pauillac swooped along, cradling in her swift\r\nflight to westward.\r\n\r\nBut all at once the man started violently. Forward he bent, staring\r\nwith widened eyes at the tube of the fuel-gage.\r\n\r\nHe blinked, as though to convince himself he had not seen aright, then\r\nstared again; and as he looked a sudden grayness overspread his face.\r\n\r\n\"_What?_\" he exclaimed, then raised his head and for a moment sniffed,\r\nas though to catch some odor, elusive yet ominous, which he had for\r\nsome time half sensed yet paid no heed to.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he knew the truth; and with a cry of fear bent, peering\r\nat the fuel-tank.\r\n\r\nThere, quivering suspended from the metal edge of the aluminum tank,\r\nhung a single clear white drop--_alcohol!_\r\n\r\nEven as Stern looked it fell, and at once another took its place, and\r\nwas shaken off only to be succeeded by a third, a fourth, a fifth!\r\n\r\nThe man understood. The ancient metal, corroded almost through from\r\nthe inside, had been eaten away. That very morning a hole had formed\r\nin the tank. And now a leak--existing since what moment he could not\r\ntell--was draining the very life-blood of the machine.\r\n\r\n\"The alcohol!\" cried Stern in a hoarse, terrible voice, his wide eyes\r\ndenoting his agitation. With a quivering hand he pointed.\r\n\r\n\"My God! It's all leaked out--there's not a quart left in the tank!\r\nWe're lost--lost in the bottomless abyss!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nLIGHTS!\r\n\r\n\r\nAt realization of the ghastly situation that confronted them,\r\nStern's heart stopped beating for a moment. Despite his courage, a\r\nsick terror gripped his soul; he felt a sudden weakness, and in his\r\nears the rushing wind seemed shouting mockeries of death.\r\n\r\nAs in a dream he felt the girl's hand close in fear upon his arm, he\r\nheard her crying something--but what, he knew not.\r\n\r\nThen all at once he fought off the deadly horror. He realized that\r\nnow, if ever, he needed all his strength, resource, intelligence. And,\r\nwith a violent effort, he flung off his weakness. Again he gripped the\r\nwheel. Thought returned. Though the end might be at hand, thank God\r\nfor even a minute's respite!\r\n\r\nAgain he looked at the indicator.\r\n\r\nYes, only too truly it showed the terrible fact! No hallucination,\r\nthis. Not much more than a pint of the precious fluid now lay in the\r\nfuel tank. And though the engine still roared, he knew that in a\r\nminute or two it must slacken, stop and die.\r\n\r\nWhat then?\r\n\r\nEven as the question flashed to him, the engine barked its protest. It\r\nskipped, coughed, stuttered. Too well he knew the symptoms, the\r\nimperative cry: \"More fuel!\"\r\n\r\nBut he had none to give. In vain for him to open wide the supply\r\nvalve. Vain to adjust the carburetor. Even as he made a despairing,\r\ninstinctive motion to perform these useless acts--while Beatrice,\r\ndeathly pale and shaking with terror, clutched at him--the engine spat\r\nforth a last, convulsive bark, and grew silent.\r\n\r\nThe whirling screws hummed a lower note, then ceased their song and\r\ncame to rest.\r\n\r\nThe machine lurched forward, swooped, spiraled, and with a sickening\r\nrush, a flailing tumult of the stays and planes, plunged into\r\nnothingness!\r\n\r\nHad Stern and the girl not been securely strapped to their seats, they\r\nmust have been precipitated into space by the violent, erratic dashes,\r\ndrops, swerves and rushes of the uncontrolled Pauillac.\r\n\r\nFor a moment or two, instinctively despite the knowledge that it could\r\ndo no good, Stern wrenched at the levers. A thousand confused, wild,\r\nterrible impressions surged upon his consciousness.\r\n\r\nSwifter, swifter dropped the plane; and now the wind that seemed to\r\nrise had grown to be a hurricane! Its roaring in their ears was\r\ndeafening. They had to fight even for breath itself.\r\n\r\nBeatrice was leaning forward now, sheltering her face in the hollow of\r\nher arm. Had she fainted? Stern could not tell. He still was fighting\r\nwith the mechanism, striving to bring it into some control. But,\r\nwithout headway, it defied him. And like a wounded hawk, dying even as\r\nit struggled, the Pauillac staggered wildly down the unplumbed abyss.\r\n\r\nHow long did the first wild drop last? Stern knew not. He realized\r\nonly that, after a certain time, he felt a warm sensation; and,\r\nlooking, perceived that they were now plunging through vapors that\r\nsped upward--so it seemed--with vertiginous rapidity.\r\n\r\nNo sensation now was there of falling. All motion seemed to lie in the\r\nuprushing vapors, dense and warm and pale violet in hue. A vast and\r\nrhythmic spiraling had possessed the Pauillac. As you have seen a\r\nfalling leaf turn in air, so the plane circled, boring with terrific\r\nspeed down, down, down through the mists, down into the unknown!\r\n\r\nNothing to be seen but vapors. No solid body, no land, no earth to\r\nmark their fall and gauge it. Yet slowly, steadily, darkness was\r\nshrouding them. And Stern, breathing with great difficulty even in the\r\nshelter of his arms, could now hardly more than see as a pale blur the\r\nwhite face of the girl beside him.\r\n\r\nThe vast wings of the machine, swirling, swooping, plunging down,\r\nloomed hugely vague in the deepening shadows. Dizzy, sick with the\r\nmonstrous caroming through space, deafened by the thunderous roaring\r\nof the up-draft, Stern was still able to retain enough of his\r\nscientific curiosity to peer upward. The sun! Could he still see it?\r\n\r\nVanished utterly was now the glorious orb! There, seeming to circle\r\nround and round in drunken spirals, he beheld a weird, diffused,\r\nangry-looking blotch of light, tinted a hue different from any ever\r\nseen on earth by men. And involuntarily, at sight of this, he\r\nshuddered.\r\n\r\nAlready with the prescience of death full upon him, with a numb\r\ndespair clutching his soul, he shrank from that ghastly, hideous\r\naspect of what he knew must be his last sight of the sun.\r\n\r\nAround the girl he drew his right arm; she felt his muscles tauten as\r\nhe clasped her to him. Useless now, he knew, any further struggles\r\nwith the aeroplane. Its speed, its plummetlike drop checked only by\r\nthe huge sweep of its parachute wings, Stern knew now it must fall\r\nclear to the bottom of the abyss--if bottom there were. And if\r\nnot--what then?\r\n\r\nStern dared not think. All human concepts had been shattered by this\r\nstupendous catastrophe. The sickly and unnatural hue of the rushing\r\nvapors that tore and slatted the planes, confused his senses; and,\r\nadded to this, a stifling, numbing gas seemed diffused through the\r\ninchoate void. He tried to speak, but could not. Against the girl's\r\ncheek he pressed his own. Hers was cold!\r\n\r\nIn vain he struggled to cry out. Even had his parched tongue been able\r\nto voice a sound, the howling tempest they themselves were creating as\r\nthey fell, would have whipped the shout away and drowned it in the\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nIn Stern's ears roared a droning as of a billion hornets. He felt a\r\nvast, tremendous lassitude. Inside his head it seemed as though a\r\nhuge, merciless pressure were grinding at his very brain. His breath\r\ncame only slowly and with great difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" he panted. \"Oh, for a little fuel! Oh, for a chance--a\r\nchance to fight--for life!\"\r\n\r\nBut chance there was none, now. Before his eyes there seemed to\r\ndarken, to dazzle, a strange and moving curtain. Through it, piercing\r\nit with a supreme effort of the will, he caught dim sight of the dial\r\nof the chronometer. Subconsciously he noted that it marked 11.25.\r\n\r\nHow long had they been falling? In vain his wavering intelligence\r\nbattered at the problem. Now, as in a delirium, he fancied it had been\r\nonly minutes; then it seemed hours. Like an insane man he laughed--he\r\ntried to scream--he raved. And only the stout straps that had held\r\nthem both prevented him from leaping free of the hurtling machine.\r\n\r\n\"Crack!\"\r\n\r\nA lashing had given way! Part of the left hand plane had broken loose.\r\nDrunkenly, whirling head over like an albatross shot in mid-air, the\r\nPauillac plunged.\r\n\r\nIt righted, swerved, shot far ahead, then once again somersaulted.\r\n\r\nStern had disjointed, crazy thoughts of air-pressure, condensation and\r\ncompression, resistance, abstruse formulae. To him it seemed that some\r\ngigantic problem in stress-calculation were being hurled at him, to\r\nsolve--it seemed that, blind, deaf, dumb, some sinister and ghoul-like\r\ndemon were flailing him until he answered--and that he could not\r\nanswer!\r\n\r\nHe had a dim realization of straining madly at his straps till the\r\nveins started big and swollen in his hammering brows. Then\r\nconsciousness lapsed.\r\n\r\nLapsed, yet came again--and with it pain. An awful pain in the\r\near-drums, that roared and crackled without cease.\r\n\r\nBreath! He was fighting for breath!\r\n\r\nIt was a nightmare--a horrible dream of darkness and a mighty booming\r\nwind--a dream of stifling vapors and an endless void that sucked them\r\ndown, down, down, eternally!\r\n\r\nDelusions came, and mocking visions of safety. Both hands flung out as\r\nthough to clutch the roaring gale, he fought the intangible.\r\n\r\nAgain he lost all knowledge.\r\n\r\nAnd once again--how long after, how could he know?--he came to some\r\npartial realization of tortured existence.\r\n\r\nIn one of the mad downward rushes--rushes which ended in a long spiral\r\nslant--his staring, bloodshot eyes that sought to pierce the murk,\r\nseemed to behold a glimmer, a dull gleam of light.\r\n\r\nThe engineer screamed imprecations, mingled with wild, demoniac\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\"Another hallucination!\" was his thought. \"But if it's not--if it's\r\nHell--then welcome, Hell! Welcome even that, for a chance to stop!\"\r\n\r\nA sweep of the Pauillac hid the light from view. Even that faintest\r\nray vanished. But--what? It came again! Much nearer now, and brighter!\r\nAnd--another gleam! Another still! Three of them--and they were\r\nreal!\r\n\r\nWith a tremendous effort, Stern fixed his fevered eyes upon the\r\nlights.\r\n\r\nUp, up at a tremendous rate they seemed speeding. Blue and ghastly\r\nthrough the dense vapors, spinning in giddy gyrations, as the machine\r\nwheeled, catapulted and slid from one long slant to another, their\r\nrelative positions still remained fixed.\r\n\r\nAnd, with a final flicker of intelligence, Stern knew they were no\r\nfigment of his brain.\r\n\r\n\"Lights, Beatrice! Lights, lights, real lights!\" he sought to scream.\r\n\r\nBut even as he fought to shake her from the swoon that wrapped her\r\nsenses, his own last fragment of strength deserted him.\r\n\r\nHe had one final sense impression of a swift upshooting of the lights,\r\na sudden brightening of those three radiant points.\r\n\r\nThen came a sudden gleam as though of waters, black and still.\r\n\r\nA gleam, blue and uncanny, across the inky surface of some vast,\r\nmysterious, hidden sea.\r\n\r\nUp rushed the lights at him; up rushed the sea of jetty black!\r\n\r\nStern shouted some wild, incoherent thing.\r\n\r\nCrash!\r\n\r\nA shock! A frightful impact, swift, sudden, annihilating!\r\n\r\nThen in a mad and lashing struggle, all knowledge and all feeling\r\nvanished utterly. And the blackness of oblivion received him into its\r\ninsensate bosom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE BARBARIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nWarmth, wetness, and a knowledge of great weakness--these,\r\njoined with a singular lassitude, oppression of the lungs and stifling\r\nof the breath, were Allan Stern's sensations when conscious life\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nPain there was as well. His body felt sorely bruised and shaken. His\r\nfirst thought, his intense yearning wonder for the girl's welfare and\r\nhis sickening fear lest she be dead, mingled with some attempt to\r\nanalyze his own suffering; to learn, if possible, what damage he had\r\ntaken in flesh and bone.\r\n\r\nHe tried to move, but found he could not. Even lying inert, as he now\r\nfound himself, so great was the exertion to breathe that only by a\r\nfight could he keep the breath of life in his shaken frame.\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes.\r\n\r\nLight! Could it be? Light in that place?\r\n\r\nYes, the light was real, and it was shining directly in his face.\r\n\r\nAt first all that his disturbed, half-delirious vision could make out\r\nwas a confused bluish glare. But in a moment this resolved itself into\r\na smoking, blazing cresset. Stern could now distinctly see the metal\r\nbands of the fire-basket in which it lay, as well as a supporting\r\nstaff, about five feet long, that seemed to vanish downward in the\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nAnd, understanding nothing, filled with vague, half-insane\r\nhallucinations and wild wonders, he tried to struggle upward with a\r\nbabbling cry:\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! Oh, Beatrice--_where are you?_\"\r\n\r\nTo his intense astonishment, a human hand, bluish in the strange\r\nglare, laid itself upon his breast and pushed him down again.\r\n\r\nAbove him he saw a face, wrinkled, bearded and ghastly blue. And as he\r\nstruggled still he perceived by the unearthly light that a figure was\r\nbending over him.\r\n\r\n\"A man!\" he gulped. \"Man! _Man!_ Oh, my God! At last--a man!\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to raise himself upon his elbow, for his whole soul was\r\nflooded with a sudden gratitude and love and joy in presence of that\r\nlong-sought goal. But instantly, as soon as his dazed senses could\r\nconvey the terrible impression to his brain, his joy was curdled into\r\nblank astonishment and fear and grief.\r\n\r\nFor to his intense chagrin, strive as he might, he could move neither\r\nhand nor foot!\r\n\r\nDuring his unconsciousness, which had lasted he could not tell how\r\nlong, he had been securely bound. And now, awakening slowly, once\r\nmore, fighting his way up into consciousness, he found himself a\r\nprisoner!\r\n\r\n_A prisoner!_ With whom? Among what people--with what purpose? After\r\nthe long quest, the frightful hardships and the tremendous fall into\r\nthe abyss, a prisoner!\r\n\r\n\"Merciful God!\" groaned Stern, and in his sudden anguish, strained\r\nagainst the bonds, that drawn tight and fast, were already cutting\r\npainfully into his swollen, water sodden flesh.\r\n\r\nIn vain did he struggle. Terrible thoughts that Beatrice, too, might\r\nbe subjected to this peril and humiliation branded themselves upon his\r\nbrain. He shouted wildly, calling her name, with all the force of his\r\nspent lungs; but naught availed. There came no answer but the\r\nshrouding fogs.\r\n\r\nThe strange man bent above him, peering from beneath wrinkled brows.\r\nStern heard a few words in a singular, guttural tone--words rendered\r\ndull by the high compression of the air. What the words might be he\r\ncould not tell, yet their general sound seemed strangely familiar and\r\ntheir command was indubitable.\r\n\r\nBut, still half-delirious, Stern tried again to stretch up his arms,\r\nto greet this singular being, even as a sick man recovering from\r\netherization raves and half sees the nurses and doctors, yet dreams\r\nwild visions in the midst of pain.\r\n\r\nThe man, however, only shook his head, and with a broad, firm hand,\r\nagain held the engineer from trying to sit up. Stern, understanding\r\nnothing clearly, relapsed to quietude. To him the thought came: \"This\r\nis only another delusion after all!\" And then a vast and poignant woe\r\npossessed him--a wonder where the girl might be. But under the\r\ncompulsion of that powerful hand, he lay quite still.\r\n\r\nHalf consciously he seemed to realize that he was lying prone in the\r\nbottom of some strange kind of boat, rude and clumsy, strangely formed\r\nof singular materials, yet safe and dry and ample.\r\n\r\nTo his laboring nostrils penetrated a rank and pungent odor of fish,\r\nwith another the like of which he never had known--an odor not\r\nunpleasant, yet keenly penetrant and all-pervading. Wet through, the\r\nengineer lay reeking in heat and steam, wrapped in his suit of heavy\r\nfurs. Then he heard a ripple of water and felt the motion of the craft\r\nas it was driven forward.\r\n\r\nAnother voice spoke now and the strange man answered briefly. Again\r\nthe engineer half seemed to comprehend the meaning, though no word was\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the girl, you?\" he shouted with all his might. \"What have you\r\ndone with her? If you hurt her, damn you, you'll be sorry!\r\n_Where--where is she?_\"\r\n\r\nNo answer. It was evident that English speech conveyed no meaning to\r\nhis captors. Stern relapsed with a groan of anguish and sheer pain.\r\n\r\nThe boat rocked. Another man came creeping forward, holding to the\r\ngunwale to steady himself. Stern saw him vaguely through the drifting\r\nvapor by the blue-green light of the cresset at the bow.\r\n\r\nHe was clad in a coarse kind of brownish stuff, like the first,\r\nroughly and loosely woven. His long hair, pure white, was twisted up\r\nin a kind of topknot and fastened there by pins of dull gold. Bearded\r\nhe was, but not one hair upon his head or chin was other than silvery\r\nwhite--a color common to all these folk, as Stern was soon to know.\r\n\r\nThis man, evidently seeing with perfect clarity by a light which\r\npermitted the engineer only partial vision, also examined Stern and\r\nmade speech thereto and nodded with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThen he put half a dozen questions to the prisoner with evident\r\nslowness and an attempt to speak each word distinctly, but nothing\r\ncame of this. And with a contemptuous grunt he went back to his\r\npaddle.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, there!\" cried Stern. \"Can't you understand? There were two\r\nof us, in a--machine, you know! We fell. Fell from the surface of the\r\nearth--fell all the way down into this pit of hell, whatever it is.\r\nWhere's the girl? For God's sake, _tell me!_\"\r\n\r\nNeither man paid any heed, but the elder suddenly set hollowed palms\r\nto his lips and hailed; and from across the waters dully drifted\r\nanother answering cry.\r\n\r\nHe shouted a sentence or two with a volume of noise at which the\r\nengineer marveled, for so compressed was the air that Stern's best\r\neffort could hardly throw a sound fifty feet. This characteristic of\r\nthe atmosphere he well recognized from work he had often done in\r\nbridge and tunnel caissons. And a wonder possessed him, despite his\r\nkeen anxiety, how any race of men could live and grow and develop the\r\nevident physical force of these people under conditions so unnatural.\r\n\r\nTurning his head and wrenching his neck sidewise, he was able to catch\r\na glimpse of the water, over the low gunwale--a gunwale made, like the\r\nframework of the boat itself, of thin metallic strips cleverly\r\nriveted.\r\n\r\nThere, approaching through the mists, he got sight of another boat,\r\nalso provided with its cresset that flung an uncanny shaft of blue\r\nacross the jetty expanse--a boat now drawing near uncles the urge of\r\nhalf-seen oarsmen. And farther still another torch was visible; and\r\nbeyond that a dozen, a score or more, all moving with dim and ghostly\r\nslowness, through the blind abyss of fog and heat and drifting vapors.\r\n\r\nStern gathered strength for another appeal.\r\n\r\n\"Who _are_ you people?\" cried he passionately. \"What are you going to\r\ndo with us? Where are we--and what kind of a place are we in? Any way\r\nto get out, out to the world again? And the girl--that girl! Oh, great\r\nGod! _Can't_ you answer something?\"\r\n\r\nNo reply. Only that same slow, strong paddling, awful in its\r\npurposeful deliberation. Stern questioned in French, Spanish and\r\nGerman, but got not even the satisfaction of attracting their\r\nattention. He flung what few phrases of Latin and Esperanto he had at\r\nthem. No result. And a huge despair filled his soul, a feeling of\r\nutter and absolute helplessness.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life--that life which had covered a thousand\r\nyears or more--he found himself unable to make himself intelligible.\r\nHe had not now even recourse to gestures, to sign language. Bound hand\r\nand foot, trussed like a fowl, ignored by his captors (who, by all\r\nrules, should have been his hosts and shown him every courtesy), he\r\nfelt a profound and terrible anger growing in his heart.\r\n\r\nA sudden rage, unreasoning and insensate, blazed within him. His fists\r\nclenched; once more he tugged, straining at his stout bonds. He called\r\ndown maledictions on those two strange, impassive, wraithlike forms\r\nhardly more than half seen in the darkness and fog.\r\n\r\nThen, as delirium won again over his tortured senses and disjointed\r\nthoughts, he shouted the name of Beatrice time after time out into the\r\nechoing dark that brooded over the great waters. All at once he heard\r\nher voice, trembling and faint and weak, but still hers!\r\n\r\nFrom the other boat it came, the boat now drawing very near. And as\r\nthe craft loomed up through the vapors that rose incessantly from that\r\nStygian sea, he made a mighty effort, raised himself a little and\r\nsuddenly beheld her--dim, vague, uncertain in the shuddering bluish\r\nglare, yet still alive!\r\n\r\nShe was crouching midships of the canoe and, seemingly, was not bound.\r\nAt his hail she stretched forth a hand and answered with his name.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Allan! Allan!\" Her voice was tremulous and very weak.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! You're safe? Thank God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurt? Are you hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--nothing to speak of. These demons haven't done you any damage,\r\nhave they? If so--\"\r\n\r\n\"Demons? Why, Allan! They've rescued us, haven't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--and now they've got me tied here, hand and foot! I can't more\r\nthan just move about two or three inches, blast them! They haven't\r\ntied you, have they?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she answered. \"Not yet! But--what an outrage! I'll free you,\r\nnever fear. You and I together--\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't do anything, now, girl. There may be hundreds of these people.\r\nThousands, perhaps. And we're only two--two captives, and--well--hang\r\nit, Beatrice! I don't mean to be pessimistic or anything like that,\r\nbut it certainly looks bad!\"\r\n\r\n\"But who are they, boy? Who can they be? And where are we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hanged if I know! This certainly beats any dream I ever had. For\r\nsheer outrageous improbability--\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off short. Beatrice had leaned her head upon her arms, along\r\nthe gunwale of the other canoe which now was running parallel to\r\nStern's, and he knew the girl was weeping.\r\n\r\n\"There, there!\" he cried to her. \"Don't you be afraid, little girl!\r\nI've got my automatic yet; I can feel it under me, as I lie here in\r\nthis infernal boat. They haven't taken yours away?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" she answered, raising her head again. \"And before they ever do,\r\nI'll use it, that's all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good girl!\" he cheered her, across the space of water. \"That's the\r\nway to talk! Whatever happens, shoot straight if you have to shoot at\r\nall--and remember, at worst, the last cartridge is for yourself!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE LAND OF THE MERUCAANS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'll remember,\" she answered simply, and for a little space there\r\ncame silence between them.\r\n\r\nA vast longing possessed the man to take her in his arms and hold her\r\ntight, tight to his fast-throbbing heart. But he lay bound and\r\nhelpless. All he could do was call to her again, as the two canoes now\r\ndrew on, side by side and as still others, joining them, made a little\r\nfleet of strange, flare-lighted craft.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, whatever happens. Maybe there's no great harm done,\r\nafter all. We're still alive and sound--that's ninety-nine per cent of\r\nthe battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"How _could_ we have fallen like that and not been killed? A miracle!\"\r\n\r\n\"The machine must have struck the surface on one of its long slants.\r\nIf it had plunged straight down--well, we shouldn't be here, that's\r\nall. These infernal pirates, whoever they are, must have been close\r\nby, in their boats, and cut us loose from our straps before the\r\nmachine sank, and got us into their canoes. But--\"\r\n\r\n\"Without the machine, how are we ever going to get out of here again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother about that now! We've got other more important things to\r\nthink of. It's all a vast and complex problem, but we'll meet it,\r\nnever fear. You and I, together, are going to win! We've got to--for\r\nthe sake of the world!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if they'd only take us for gods, as the Horde did!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gods nothing! They're as white as we are--whiter, even. People that\r\ncan make boats like these, out of iron bars covered with pitched\r\nfabric, and weave cloth like this they're wearing, and use oil-flares\r\nin metal baskets, aren't mistaking us for gods. The way they've\r\nhandled me proves it. Might be a good thing if they weren't so\r\ndevilish intelligent!\"\r\n\r\nHe relapsed into silence, and for a while there came no sound but the\r\ncadenced dipping of many paddles as the boats, now perhaps a score in\r\nnumber, all slowly moved across the unfathomed black as though toward\r\nsome objective common point. Each craft bore at its bow a fire-basket\r\nfilled with some spongy substance, which, oil-soaked, blazed smokily\r\nwith that peculiar blue-green light so ghostly in its wavering\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nMany of the folk sat in these boats, among their brown fiber nets and\r\nlong, iron-tipped lances. All alike were pale and anemic-looking,\r\nthough well-muscled and of vigorous build. Even the youngest were\r\nwhite-haired. All wore their hair twisted in a knot upon the crown of\r\nthe head; none boasted anything even suggesting a hat or cap.\r\n\r\nBy contrast with their chalky skins, white eyebrows and lashes, their\r\npinkish eyes--for all the world like those of an albino--blinked oddly\r\nas they squinted ahead, as though to catch some sign of land. Every\r\none wore a kind of cassock of the brown coarse material; a few were\r\ngirdled with belts of skin, having well-wrought metal buckles. Their\r\npaddles were not of wood. Not one trace of wood, in fact, was anywhere\r\nto be seen. Light metal blades, well-shaped and riveted to iron\r\nhandles, served for propulsion.\r\n\r\nStern lay back, still faint and sick with the shock of the fall and\r\nwith the pain, humiliation and excitement of the capture. Yet through\r\nit all he rejoiced that the girl and he had escaped with life and were\r\nboth still sound of limb and faculty.\r\n\r\nEven the loss of the machine could not destroy all his natural\r\nenthusiasm, or kill his satisfaction in this great adventuring, his\r\njoy at having found after all, a remnant of the human race once more.\r\n\r\n\"Men, by the Almighty!\" thought he, peering keenly at such as he could\r\nsee through the coiling, spiraling wreaths of mist that arose from the\r\nblack water into the dun air. \"Men! _White_ men, too! Given such stock\r\nto work with--provided I get the chance--who shall say anything's\r\nimpossible? If only there's some way out of this infernal hole, what\r\nmay not happen?\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as he watched, he thrilled with nascent pride, with consciousness\r\nof a tremendous mission to perform; a sense that here--here in the\r\nactual living flesh--dwelt the potentialities of all his dreams, of\r\nall the many deep and noble plans which he and Beatrice had laid for a\r\nregenerated world!\r\n\r\nMen they certainly were, white men, Caucasians, even like himself.\r\nDespite all changes of superficial character, their build and cast of\r\nfeatures bore witness that these incredible folk, dwellers upon that\r\nnameless and buried sea, were the long-distant descendants of\r\nAmericans!\r\n\r\n\"Americans, so help me!\" he pondered as the boats drew onward toward\r\nwhat goal he knew not. \"Barbarians, yet Americans, still. And with\r\nhalf a chance at them, God! we'll work miracles yet, she and I!\"\r\n\r\nAgain he raised his voice, calling to Beatrice:\r\n\r\n\"Don't be afraid, little girl! They're our own people, after\r\nall--Americans!\"\r\n\r\nAt sound of that word a startled cry broke from the lips of Stern's\r\nelder boatman, a cry which, taken up from boat to boat, drifted dully\r\nthrough the fog, traversed the whole fleet of strange, slow-moving\r\ncraft, and lost itself in the vague gloom.\r\n\r\n\"Merucaans! Merucaans!\" the shout arose, with other words whereof\r\nStern knew not the meaning; and closer pressed the outlying boats. The\r\nengineer felt a thrill run through the strange, mysterious folk.\r\n\r\n\"They knew their name, anyhow! Hurrah!\" he exulted. \"God! If we had\r\nthe Stars and Stripes here, I wager a million they'd go mad about it!\r\nRemember? You bet they'll remember, when I learn their lingo and tell\r\nthem a few things! Just wait till I get a chance at 'em, that's all!\"\r\n\r\nForgotten now his bonds and all his pain. Forgotten even the perilous\r\nsituation. Stern's great vision of a reborn race had swallowed minor\r\nevils. And with a sudden glow of pride that some of his own race had\r\nstill survived the vast world catastrophe, he cheered again, eager as\r\nany schoolboy.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard the girl's voice calling to him:\r\n\r\n\"Something ahead, Allan--land, maybe. A big light through the mist!\"\r\n\r\nHe wrenched his head a trifle up and now perceived that through the\r\nvapors a dim yet steady glow was beginning to shine, and on each side\r\nof it there stretched a line of other, smaller, blue-green lights.\r\nThese, haloed by the vapor with the most beautiful prismatic rings,\r\nextended in an irregular row high above water level.\r\n\r\nLower down other lights were moving slowly to and fro, gathering for\r\nthe most part at a point toward which the boats were headed.\r\n\r\n\"A settlement, Beatrice! A town, maybe! At last--men, _men!_\" he\r\ncried.\r\n\r\nForward the boats moved, faster now, as the rowers bent to their\r\ntasks; and all at once, spontaneously, a song rose up. First from one\r\nboat, then another, that weird, strange melody drifted through the\r\ndark air. It blended into a spectral chorus, a vague, tremulous, eerie\r\nchant, ghostlike and awful, as though on the black stream of Acheron\r\nthe lost souls of a better world had joined in song.\r\n\r\nNothing could Stern catch of the words; but like some faint and far\r\nre-echoing of a half-heard melody, dream-music perhaps, a vaguely\r\nreminiscent undertone struck to his heart with an irresistible,\r\nmelancholy, penetrant appeal.\r\n\r\n\"That tune! I know it--if I could only think!\" the engineer exclaimed.\r\n\"Those words! I almost seem to know them!\"\r\n\r\nThen, with the suddenness characteristic of all that drew near in the\r\nfog, the shore-lights grew rapidly bigger and more bright.\r\n\r\nThe rowers lay back on their paddles at a sharp word of command from\r\none of the oarsmen in Stern's boat.\r\n\r\nCame a grating, a sliding of keels on pebbles. The boat stopped.\r\nOthers came up to land. From them men began clambering.\r\n\r\nThe song died. A sound of many voices rose, as the boatmen mingled\r\nwith those who, bearing torches, now began gathering about the two\r\ncanoes where Stern and Beatrice still were.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we're here, anyhow, wherever _here_ is!\" exclaimed the\r\nengineer. \"Hey, you fellows, let me loose, will you? What kind of a\r\nway is this to treat a stranger, I'd like to know?\"\r\n\r\nTwo of the men waded through the water, tepid as new milk, to where\r\nStern lay fast-bound, lifted him easily and carried him ashore. Black\r\nthough the water was, Stern saw that it was clear. As the torch-light\r\nstruck down through it, he could distinguish the clean and sandy\r\nbottom shining with metallic luster.\r\n\r\nA strange hissing sound pervaded all the air, now sinking to a dull\r\nroar, now rising shrill as a vast jet of escaping steam.\r\n\r\nAs the tone lowered, darkness seemed to gain, through the mists; its\r\nrising brought a clearer light. But what the phenomenon was, Stern\r\ncould not tell. For the source of the faint, diffused illumination\r\nthat verberated through the vapor was hidden; it seemed to be a huge\r\nand fluctuating glow, off there somewhere beyond the fog-curtain that\r\nveiled whatever land this strange weird place might be.\r\n\r\nVague, silent, dim, the wraithlike men stood by, peering with bent\r\nbrows, just as Dante described the lost souls in Hell peering at\r\nVirgil in the eternal night. A dream-crew they seemed. Even though\r\nStern felt the vigorous muscles of the pair who now had borne him up\r\nto land, he could scarce realize their living entity.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! Beatrice!\" he called. \"Are you all right? Don't mind about\r\nme--just look out for yourself! If they hurt you in any way, shoot!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right, I'm coming!\" He heard her voice, and then he saw the\r\ngirl herself. Unaided she had clambered from her boat; and now,\r\nbreaking through the throng, she sought to reach him. But hands held\r\nher back, and words of hard command rose from a score of lips.\r\n\r\nStern had only time to see that she was as yet unharmed when with a\r\nquick slash of a blade somebody cut the thongs that bound his feet.\r\n\r\nThen he was pushed forward, away from the dim and ghostly sea up an\r\nacclivity of smooth black pebbles all wet with mist.\r\n\r\nLimping stiffly, by reason of his cramped muscles, he stumbled onward,\r\nwhile all about him and behind him--as about the girl, who\r\nfollowed--came the throng of these strange people.\r\n\r\nTheir squinting, pinkish eyes and pallid faces showed ghastly by the\r\ntorch-glare, as, murmuring among themselves in their incomprehensible\r\nyet strangely familiar tongue, they climbed the slope.\r\n\r\nEven then, even there on that unknown beach beside an uncharted sea at\r\nthe bottom of the fathomless abyss, Stern thought with joy of his\r\nrevolver which still swung on his hip.\r\n\r\n\"God knows how we're going to talk to these people,\" reflected he, \"or\r\nwhat sort of trouble they've got ready to hand out to us. But, once I\r\nget my right hand free--I'm ready for whatever comes!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE DUNGEON OF THE SKELETONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the two interlopers from the outer world moved up the\r\nslippery beach toward the great, mist-dimmed flare, escorted by the\r\nstrange and spectral throng, Stern had time to analyze some factors of\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that diplomacy was now--unless in a sharp crisis--the\r\nonly role to play. How many of these people there might be he could\r\nnot tell. The present gathering he estimated at about a hundred and\r\nfifty or a hundred and seventy-five; and moment by moment more were\r\ncoming down the slope, looming through the vapor, each carrying a\r\ncresset on a staff or a swinging light attached to a chain.\r\n\r\n\"The village or settlement, or whatever it is,\" thought he, \"may\r\ncontain hundreds of them, thousands perhaps. And _we_ are only two!\r\nThe last thing in the world we want is a fight. But if it comes to\r\nfighting, Beatrice and I with our backs to the wall could certainly\r\nmake a mighty good showing against barbarians such as these.\r\n\r\n\"It's evident from the fact that they haven't taken our revolvers away\r\nthey don't know the use of firearms. Ages ago they must have forgotten\r\neven the tradition of such weapons. Their culture status seems to be a\r\nkind of advanced barbarism. Some job, here, to bring them up to\r\ncivilization again.\"\r\n\r\nSlow-moving, unemotional, peering dimly through the hot fog, their\r\nwraithlike appearance (as more and more came crowding) depressed and\r\nsaddened Stern beyond all telling.\r\n\r\nAnd at thought that these were the remnants of the race which once had\r\nconquered a vast continent, built tall cities and spanned abysses with\r\nsteel--the remnants of so many million keen, energetic, scientific\r\npeople--he groaned despairingly.\r\n\r\n\"What does all this mean?\" he exclaimed in a kind of passionate\r\noutburst. \"Where are we? How did you get here? Can't you understand\r\nme? We're Americans, I tell you--Americans! For God's sake, _can't you\r\nunderstand?_\"\r\n\r\nOnce more the word \"Merucaans\" passed round from mouth to mouth; but\r\nbeyond this Stern got no sign of comprehension.\r\n\r\n\"Village! Houses!\" shouted he. \"Shelter! Rest, eat, sleep!\"\r\n\r\nThey merely shoved him forward up the slope, together with the girl;\r\nand now Stern saw a curious kind of causeway, paved with slippery,\r\nwet, black stones that gleamed in the torchlight, a causeway slanting\r\nsharply upward, its further end hidden in the dense vapor behind\r\nwhich the great and unknown light shone with ever-clearer glowing.\r\n\r\nThis road wash bordered on either hand by a wall of carefully cut\r\nstone about three and a half feet high; and into the wall, at equal\r\ndistances of twenty feet or so, iron rods had been let. Each rod bore\r\na fire-basket, some only dully flickering, some burning bright and\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nNumbers of the strange folk were loitering on the causeway or coming\r\ndown to join the throng which now ascended; many clambered lithely up\r\nonto the wall, and, holding to the rods or to each other--for the\r\nstones, like everything here, were wet and glairy--watched with those\r\nsingular-hued and squinting eyes of theirs the passage of the\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nStern and Beatrice, their breathing now oppressed by the thickening\r\nsmoke which everywhere hung heavy, as well as by this fresh exertion\r\nin the densely compressed air, toiled, panting, up the steep incline.\r\n\r\nThe engineer was already bathed in a heavy sweat. The intense heat,\r\nwell above a hundred degrees, added to the humidity, almost stifled\r\nhim. His bound arms pained almost beyond endurance. Unable to balance\r\nhimself, he slipped and staggered.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice!\" he called chokingly. \"Try to make them understand I want\r\nmy hands freed. It's bad enough trying to clamber up this infernal\r\nroad, anyhow, without having to go at it all trussed up this way.\"\r\n\r\nShe, needing no second appeal, raised her free arms, pointed to her\r\nwrists and then at his, and made a gesture as of cutting. But the\r\nelder boatman of Stern's canoe--seemingly a person of some\r\nauthority--only shook his head and urged the prisoners upward, ever\r\nupward toward the great and growing light.\r\n\r\nNow they had reached the top of the ascent.\r\n\r\nOn either hand, vanishing in shadows and mist, heavy and high walls\r\nextended, all built of black, cut stone surmounted by cressets.\r\n\r\nThrough a gateway the throng passed, and the prisoners with them--a\r\ngateway built of two massive monoliths of dressed stone, octagonal and\r\nhighly polished, with a huge, straight plinth that Stern estimated at\r\na glance never could have weighed less than ten tons.\r\n\r\n\"Ironwork, heavy stonework, weaving, fisheries--a good beginning here\r\nto work on,\" thought the engineer. But there was little time for\r\nanalysis. For now already they were passing through a complex series\r\nof inner gateways, passages, detours and labyrinthic defenses\r\nwhich--all well lighted from above by fire-baskets--spoke only too\r\nplainly the character of the enclosure within.\r\n\r\n\"A walled town, heavily fortified,\" Stern realized as he and Beatrice\r\nwere thrust forward through the last gate. \"Evidently these people are\r\nliving here in constant fear of attack by formidable foes. I'll wager\r\nthere's been some terrible fighting in these narrow ways--and there\r\nmay be some more, too, before we're through with it. God, what a\r\nplace! Makes me think of the _machicoulis_ and pasterns at old\r\nCarcassonne. So far as this is concerned, we're back again in the Dark\r\nAges--dark, dark as Erebus!\"\r\n\r\nThen, all at once, out they issued into so strange a scene that,\r\ninvoluntarily, the two captives stopped short, staring about them with\r\nwide eyes.\r\n\r\nStretching away before them till the fog swallowed it--a fog now\r\nglowing with light from some source still mist-hidden--an open plaza\r\nstretched. This plaza was all surrounded, so far as they could see,\r\nwith singular huts, built of dressed stone, circular for the most\r\npart, and with conical roofs like monster beehives. Windows there were\r\nnone, but each hut had an open door facing the source of the strange,\r\nblue-green light.\r\n\r\nStern could now see the inside of the wall, topped with torches; its\r\ncrest rose some five feet above the level of the plaza; and, where he\r\ncould catch a glimpse of its base between the huts and through the\r\ncrowding folk, he noticed that huge quantities of boulders were piled\r\nas though for instant use in case of attack.\r\n\r\nA singular dripping of warmish water, here a huge drop, there another,\r\nattracted his attention; but though he looked up to determine its\r\nsource, if possible, he could see nothing except the glowing mist. The\r\nwhole floor of the enclosure seemed to be wet and shining with this\r\nwater; and all the roughly clad folk, now coming from the huts and\r\nconcentrating toward the captives, from every direction, were wet as\r\nwell, as though with this curious, constant, sparsely scattered rain.\r\n\r\nNot a quadruped of any kind was to be seen. Neither cat nor dog was\r\nthere, neither goat nor pig nor any other creature such as in the\r\nmeanest savage villages of other times might have been found upon the\r\nsurface of the earth. But, undisturbed and bold, numbers of a most\r\nextraordinary fowl--a long-legged, red-necked fowl, wattled and huge\r\nof beak--gravely waddled here and there or perched singly and in\r\nsolemn rows upon the huts.\r\n\r\n\"Great Heavens, Beatrice,\" exclaimed the engineer, \"what are we up\r\nagainst? Of all the incredible places! That light! That roaring!\"\r\n\r\nHe had difficulty in making himself even heard. For now the hissing\r\nroar which they had perceived from afar off seemed to fill the place\r\nwith a tremendous vibrant blur, rising, falling, as the light waxed\r\nand waned.\r\n\r\nTerribly confusing all these new sense-impressions were to Stern and\r\nBeatrice in their unnerved and weakened state. And, staring about them\r\nas they went, they slowly moved along with the motion of their captors\r\ntoward the great light.\r\n\r\nAll at once Stern stopped, with a startled cry.\r\n\r\n\"The infernal devils!\" he exclaimed, and recoiled with an involuntary\r\nshudder from the sight that met his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe girl, too, cried out in fear.\r\n\r\nSome air-current, some heated blast of vapor from the vast flame they\r\nnow saw shooting upward from the stone flooring of the plaza, momently\r\ndispelled the thick, white vapors.\r\n\r\nStern got a glimpse of a circular row of stone posts, each about nine\r\nfeet high--he saw not the complete circle, but enough of it to judge\r\nits diameter as some fifty feet. In the center stood a round and\r\nmassive building, and from each post to that building stretched a\r\nmetal rod perhaps twenty feet in length.\r\n\r\n\"Look! _Look!_\" gasped Beatrice, and pointed.\r\n\r\nThen, deadly pale, she hid her face in both her hands and crouched\r\naway, as though to blot the sight from her perception.\r\n\r\nEach metal bar was sagging with a hideous load--a row of human\r\nskeletons, stark, fleshless, frightful in their ghastliness. All were\r\nheadless. All, suspended by the cervical vertebrae, swayed lightly as\r\nthe blue-green light glared on them with its weird, unearthly\r\nradiance.\r\n\r\nBefore either Stern or the girl had time even to struggle or so much\r\nas recover from the shock of this fell sight, they were both pushed\r\nroughly between two of the posts into the frightful circle.\r\n\r\nStern saw a door yawn black before them in the massive hut of stone.\r\n\r\nToward this the Folk of the Abyss were thrusting them.\r\n\r\n\"No, you don't, damn you!\" he howled with sudden passion. \"None o'\r\nthat for _us!_ Shoot, Beta! _Shoot!_\"\r\n\r\nBut even as her hand jerked at the butt of the automatic, in its\r\nrawhide holster on her hip, an overmastering force flung them both\r\nforward into the foul dark of the round dungeon. A metal door clanged\r\nshut. Absolute darkness fell.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" cried Stern. \"Beta! Where are you? Beta! _Beta!_\"\r\n\r\nBut answer there was none. The girl had fainted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\"YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEven in his pain and rage and fear, Stern did not lose his\r\nwits. Too great the peril, he subconsciously realized, for any false\r\nstep now. Despite the fact that the stone prison could measure no more\r\nthan some ten feet in diameter, he knew that in its floors some pit or\r\nfissure might exist, frightfully deep, for their destruction.\r\n\r\nAnd other dangers, too, might lie hidden in this fearful place. So,\r\nrestraining himself with a strong effort, he stood there motionless a\r\nfew seconds, listening, trying to think. Severe now the pain from his\r\nlashed wrists had grown, but he no longer felt it. Strange visions\r\nseemed to dance before his eyes, for weakness and fever were at work\r\nupon him. In his ears still sounded, though muffled now, the constant\r\nhissing roar of the great flame, the mysterious and monstrous jet of\r\nfire which seemed to form the center of this unknown, incomprehensible\r\nlife in the abyss.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Heavens!\" gasped he. \"That fire--those skeletons--this black\r\ncell--what can they mean?\" He found no answer in his bewildered brain.\r\nOnce more he called, \"Beatrice! _Beatrice!_\" but only the close echo\r\nof the prison replied.\r\n\r\nHe listened, holding his breath in sickening fear. Was there, in\r\ntruth, some waiting, yawning chasm in the cell, and had she, thrust\r\nrudely forward, been hurled down it? At the thought he set his jaws\r\nwith terrible menace and swore, to the last drop of his blood,\r\nvengeance on these inhuman captors.\r\n\r\nBut as he listened, standing there with bound hands in the thick\r\ngloom, he seemed to catch a slow and sighing sound, as of troubled\r\nbreathing. Again he called. No answer. Then he understood the truth.\r\nAnd, unable to grope with his hands, he swung one foot slowly, gently,\r\nin the partial circumference of a circle.\r\n\r\nAt first he found nothing save the smooth and slippery stone of the\r\nfloor, but, having shifted his position very cautiously and tried\r\nagain, he experienced the great joy of feeling his sandaled foot come\r\nin contact with the girl's prostrate body.\r\n\r\nBeside her on the floor he knelt. He could not free his hands, but he\r\ncould call to her and kiss her face. And presently, even while the joy\r\nof this discovery was keen upon him, obscuring the hot rage he felt,\r\nshe moved, she spoke a few vague words, and reached her hands up to\r\nhim; she clasped him in her arms.\r\n\r\nAnd there in the close, fetid dark, imprisoned, helpless, doomed, they\r\nkissed again, and once more--though no word was spoken--plighted their\r\nlove and deep fidelity until the end.\r\n\r\n\"Hurt? Are you hurt?\" he panted eagerly, as she sat up on the hard\r\nfloor and with her hands smoothed back the hair from his hot, aching\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"I feel so weak and dizzy,\" she answered. \"And I'm afraid--oh, Allan,\r\nI'm afraid! But, no, I'm not hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God for that!\" he breathed fervently. \"Can you untie these\r\ninfernal knots? They're almost cutting my hands off!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, let me try!\"\r\n\r\nAnd presently the girl set to work; but even though she labored till\r\nher fingers ached, she could not start the tight and water-soaked\r\nligatures.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, wait a minute,\" directed he. \"Feel in my right-hand pocket.\r\nMaybe they forgot to take my knife.\"\r\n\r\nShe obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"They've got it,\" she announced. \"Even if they don't know the meaning\r\nof revolvers, they understand knives all right. It's gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pest!\" he ejaculated hotly. Then for a moment he sat thinking, while\r\nthe girl again tried vainly to loosen the hard-drawn knots.\r\n\r\n\"Can you find the iron door they shoved us through?\" asked he at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n\"I'll see!\"\r\n\r\nHe heard her creeping cautiously along the walls of stone, feeling as\r\nshe went.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" he warned. \"Keep testing the floor as you go. There may be\r\na crevice or pit or something of that kind.\"\r\n\r\nAll at once she cried: \"Here it is! I've found it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! Now, then, feel it all over and see if there's any rough place\r\non it. Any sharp edge of a plate, or anything of that kind, that I\r\ncould rub the cords on.\"\r\n\r\nAnother silence. Then the girl spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of that kind here,\" she answered depairingly. \"The door's as\r\nsmooth as if it had been filed and polished. There's not even a lock\r\nof any kind. It must be fastened from the outside in some way.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Heaven, this is certainly a hard proposition!\" exclaimed the\r\nengineer, groaning despite himself. \"What the deuce are we going to do\r\n_now?_\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment he remained sunk in a kind of dull and apathetic respair.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he gave a cry of joy.\r\n\r\n\"I've got it!\" he exclaimed. \"Your revolver, quick! Aim at the\r\nopposite wall, there, and fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoot, in here?\" she queried, astonished. \"Why--what for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind! Shoot!\"\r\n\r\nAmazed, she did his bidding. The crash of the report almost deafened\r\nthem in that narrow room. By the stabbing flare of the discharge they\r\nglimpsed the black and shining walls, a deadly circle all about them.\r\n\r\n\"Again?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"No. That's enough. Now, find the bullet. It's somewhere on the floor.\r\nThere's no pit; it's all solid. The bullet--find the bullet!\"\r\n\r\nQuestioning no more, yet still not understanding, she groped on hands\r\nand knees in the impenetrable blackness. The search lasted more than\r\nfive minutes before her hand fell on the jagged bit of metal.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried she. \"Here it is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! Tell me, is the steel jacket burst in any such way as to make a\r\njagged edge?\"\r\n\r\nA moment's silence, while her deft fingers examined the metal. Then\r\nsaid she:\r\n\r\n\"I think so. It's a terribly small bit to saw with, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"To work, then! I can't stand this much longer.\"\r\n\r\nWith splendid energy the girl attacked the tough and water-soaked\r\nbonds. She worked half an hour before the first one, thread by thread\r\nyielding, gave way. The second followed soon after; and now, with torn\r\nand bleeding fingers, she released the final bond.\r\n\r\n\"Thank Heaven!\" he breathed as she began chafing his numb wrists and\r\narms to bring the circulation back again; and presently, when he had\r\nregained some use of his own hands, he also rubbed his arms.\r\n\r\n\"No great damage done, after all,\" he judged, \"so far as this is\r\nconcerned. But, by the Almighty, we're in one frightful fix every\r\nother way! Hark! Hear those demons outside there? God knows what\r\nthey're up to now!\"\r\n\r\nBoth prisoners listened.\r\n\r\nEven through the massive walls of the circular dungeon they could hear\r\na dull and gruesome chant that rose, fell, died, and then resumed,\r\nseemingly in unison with the variant roaring of the flame.\r\n\r\nThereto, also, an irregular metallic sound, as of blows struck on\r\niron, and now and then a shrill, high-pitched cry. The effect of these\r\nstrange sounds, rendered vague and unreal by the density of the walls,\r\nand faintly penetrating the dreadful darkness, surpassed all efforts\r\nof the imagination.\r\n\r\nBeatrice and Stern, bold as they were, hardened to rough adventurings,\r\nfelt their hearts sink with bodings, and for a while they spoke\r\nno word. They sat there together on the floor of polished\r\nstone--perceptibly warm to the touch and greasy with a peculiarly\r\nrepellent substance--and thought long thoughts which neither one dared\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nBut at length the engineer, now much recovered from his pain and from\r\nthe oppression of the lungs caused by the compressed air, reached for\r\nthe girl's hand in the dark.\r\n\r\n\"Without you where should I be?\" he exclaimed. \"My good angel now, as\r\nalways!\"\r\n\r\nShe made no answer, but returned the pressure of his hand. And for a\r\nwhile silence fell between them there--silence broken only by their\r\ntroubled breathing and the cadenced roaring of the huge gas-well flame\r\noutside the prison wall.\r\n\r\nAt last Stern spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get some better idea of this place,\" said he. \"Maybe if we know\r\njust what we're up against we'll understand better what to do.\"\r\n\r\nAnd slowly, cautiously, with every sense alert, he began exploring the\r\ndungeon. Floor and walls he felt of, with minute care, reaching as\r\nhigh as he could and eagerly seeking some possible crevice, some\r\npromise--no matter how remote--of ultimate escape.\r\n\r\nBut the examination ended only in discouragement. Smooth almost as\r\nglass the walls were, and the floor as well, perhaps worn down by\r\ncountless prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe iron door, cleverly let into the wall, lay flush with it, and\r\noffered not the slightest irregularity to the touch. So nicely was it\r\nfitted that not even Stern's finger-nail could penetrate the joint.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing doing in the escape line,\" he passed judgment unwillingly.\r\n\"Barbarians these people certainly are, in some ways, but they've got\r\nthe arts of stone and iron working down fine. I, as an engineer, have\r\nto appreciate that, and give the remote descendants of our race credit\r\nfor it, even if it works our ruin. Gad, but they're clever, though!\"\r\n\r\nDiscouraged, in spite of all his attempted optimism, he sought the\r\ngirl again, there in the deep and velvet dark. To himself he drew her;\r\nand, his arm about her sinuous, supple body, tried to comfort her with\r\ncheering speech.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Beatrice, they haven't got us _yet!_ We're better off, on the\r\nwhole, than we had any right to hope for, after having fallen one or\r\ntwo hundred miles--maybe five hundred, who knows? If I can manage to\r\nget a word or two with these confounded barbarians, I'll maybe save\r\nour bacon yet! And, at worst--well, we're in a mighty good little fort\r\nhere. I pity anybody that tries to come in that door and get us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Allan--those skeletons, those headless skeletons!\" she whispered;\r\nand in his arms he felt her shudder with unconquerable fear.\r\n\r\n\"I know; but they aren't going to add _us_ to their little collection,\r\nyou mark my words! These men are white; they're our own kind, even\r\nthough they have slid back into barbarism. They'll listen to reason,\r\nonce I get a chance at them.\"\r\n\r\nThus, talking of the abyss and of their fall--now of one phase, now\r\nanother, of their frightful position--they passed an hour in the\r\nstifling dark.\r\n\r\nAnd, joining their observations and ideas, they were able to get some\r\ngeneral idea of the conditions under which these incredible folk were\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nFrom the warmth of the sea and the immense quantities of vapor that\r\nfilled the abyss, they concluded that it must be at a tremendous depth\r\nin the earth--perhaps as far down as Stern's extreme guess of five\r\nhundred miles--and also that it must be of very large extent.\r\n\r\nBeatrice had noted also that the water was salt. This led them to the\r\nconclusion that in some way or other, perhaps intermittently, the\r\noceans on the surface were supplying the subterranean sea.\r\n\r\n\"If I'm not much mistaken,\" judged the engineer, \"that tremendous\r\nmaelstrom near the site of New Haven--the cataract that almost got us,\r\njust after we started out--has something very vital to do with this\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\"In that case, and if there's a way for water to come down, why mayn't\r\nthere be a way for us to climb _up?_ Who knows?\"\r\n\r\n\"But if there were,\" she answered, \"wouldn't these people have found\r\nit, in all these hundreds and hundreds of years?\"\r\n\r\nThey discussed the question, pro and con, with many another that bore\r\non the folk--this strange and inexplicable imprisonment, the huge\r\nflame at the center of the community's life, the probable intentions\r\nof their captors, and the terrifying rows of headless skeletons.\r\n\r\n\"What those mean I don't know,\" said Stern. \"There may be human\r\nsacrifice here, and offerings of blood to some outlandish god they've\r\ninvented. Or these relics may be trophies of battle with other peoples\r\nof the abyss.\r\n\r\n\"To judge from the way this place is fortified, I rather think there\r\nmust be other tribes, with more or less constant warfare. The infernal\r\nfools! When the human race is all destroyed, as it is, except a few\r\nhandfuls of albino survivors, to make war and kill each other! It's on\r\na par with the old Maoris of New Zealand, who practically exterminated\r\neach other--fought till most of the tribes were wiped clean out and\r\nonly a remnant was left for the British to subdue!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm more interested in what they're going to do with us now,\" she\r\nanswered, shuddering, \"than in how many or how few survive! What are\r\nwe going to do, Allan? What on earth can we do now?\"\r\n\r\nHe thought a moment, while the strange chant, dimly heard, rose and\r\nfell outside, always in unison with the gigantic flame. Then said he:\r\n\r\n\"Do? Nothing, for the immediate present. Nothing, except wait, and\r\nkeep all the nerve and strength we can. No use in our shouting and\r\nmaking a row. They'd only take that as an admission of fear and\r\nweakness, just as any barbarians would. No use hammering on the iron\r\ndoor with our revolver-butts, and annoying our white brothers by\r\ninterrupting their song services.\r\n\r\n\"Positively the only thing I can see to do is just to make sure both\r\nautomatics are crammed full of cartridges, keep our wits about us, and\r\nplug the first man that comes in through that door with the notion of\r\nmaking sacrifices of us. I certainly don't hanker after martyrdom of\r\nthat sort, and, by God! the savage that lays hands on you, dies inside\r\nof one second by the stop-watch!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, boy; but against so many, what are two revolvers?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're everything! My guess is that a little target practice would\r\nput the fear of God into their hearts in a most extraordinary manner!\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to speak lightly and to cheer the girl, but in his breast his\r\nheart lay heavy as a lump of lead.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose they _don't_ come in, what then?\" suddenly resumed Beatrice.\r\n\"What if they leave us here till--\"\r\n\r\n\"There, there, little girl! Don't you go borrowing any trouble! We've\r\ngot enough of the real article, without manufacturing any!\"\r\n\r\nSilence again, and a long, dark, interminable waiting. In the black\r\ncell the air grew close and frightfully oppressive. Clad as they both\r\nwere in fur garments suitable to outdoor life and to aeroplaning at\r\ngreat altitudes, they were suffering intensely from the heat.\r\n\r\nStern's wrists and arms, moreover, still pained considerably, for they\r\nhad been very cruelly bruised with the ropes, which the barbarians had\r\ndrawn tight with a force that bespoke both skill and deftness. His\r\nneed of some occupation forced him to assure himself, a dozen times\r\nover, that both revolvers were completely filled. Fortunately, the\r\ncaptors had not known enough to rob either Beatrice or him of the\r\ncartridge-belts they wore.\r\n\r\nHow long a time passed? One hour, two, three?\r\n\r\nThey could not tell.\r\n\r\nBut, overcome by the vitiated air and the great heat, Beatrice slept\r\nat last, her head in the man's lap. He, utterly spent, leaned his back\r\nagainst the wall of black and polished stone, nodding with weariness\r\nand great exhaustion.\r\n\r\nHe, too, must have dropped off into a troubled sleep, for he did not\r\nhear the unbolting of the massive iron cell-door.\r\n\r\nBut all at once, with a quick start, he recovered consciousness. He\r\nfound himself broad awake, with the girl clutching at his arm and\r\npointing.\r\n\r\nWith dazzled eyes he stared--stared at a strange figure standing\r\nframed in a rectangle of blue and foggy light.\r\n\r\nEven as he shouted: \"Hold on, there! Get back out o' that, you!\" and\r\njerked his ugly pistol at the old man's breast--for very aged this man\r\nseemed, bent and feeble and trembling as he leaned upon an iron\r\nstaff--a voice spoke dully through the half-gloom, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Peace, friends! Peace be unto you!\"\r\n\r\nStern started up in wild amaze.\r\n\r\nFrom his nerveless fingers the pistol dropped. And, as it clattered on\r\nthe floor, he cried:\r\n\r\n\"English? You speak _English?_ Who _are_ you? English! English! Oh,\r\nmy God!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nDOOMED!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aged man stood for a moment as though tranced at sound of\r\nthe engineer's voice. Then, tapping feebly with his staff, he advanced\r\na pace or two into the dungeon. And Stern and Beatrice--who now had\r\nsprung up, too, and was likewise staring at this singular\r\napparition--heard once again the words:\r\n\r\n\"Peace, friends! Peace!\"\r\n\r\nStern snatched up the revolver and leveled it.\r\n\r\n\"Stop there!\" he shouted. \"Another step and I--I--\"\r\n\r\nThe old man hesitated, one hand holding the staff, the other groping\r\nout vacantly in front of him, as though to touch the prisoners. Behind\r\nhim, the dull blue light cast its vague glow. Stern, seeing his bald\r\nand shaking head, lean, corded hand, and trembling body wrapped in its\r\nmantle of coarse brown stuff, could not finish the threat.\r\n\r\nInstead, his pistol-hand dropped. He stood there for a moment as\r\nthough paralyzed with utter astonishment. Outside, the chant had\r\nceased. Through the doorway no living beings were visible--nothing but\r\na thin and tenuous vapor, radiant in the gas-flare which droned its\r\nnever-ending roar.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of Heaven, who--what--_are_ you?\" cried the engineer, at\r\nlength. \"A man who speaks English, _here? Here?_\"\r\n\r\nThe aged one nodded slowly, and once again groped out toward Stern.\r\n\r\nThen, in his strangely hollow voice, unreal and ghostly, and with\r\nuncertain hesitation, an accent that rendered the words all but\r\nunintelligible, he made answer:\r\n\r\n\"A man--yea, a living man. Not a ghost. A man! and I speak the\r\nEnglish. Verily, I am ancient. Blind, I go unto my fathers soon. But\r\nnot until I have had speech with you. Oh, this miracle--English speech\r\nwith those to whom it still be a living tongue!\"\r\n\r\nHe choked, and for a space could say no more. He trembled violently.\r\nStern saw his frail body shake, heard sobs, and knew the ancient one\r\nwas weeping.\r\n\r\n\"Well, great Scott! What d'you think of _that?_\" exclaimed the\r\nengineer. \"Say, Beatrice--am I dreaming? Do you see it, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course! He's a survivor, don't you understand?\" she answered, with\r\nquicker intuition than his. \"He's one of an elder generation--he\r\nremembers more! Perhaps he can help us!\" she added eagerly. And\r\nwithout more ado, running to the old man, she seized his hand and\r\npressed it to her bosom.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father!\" cried she. \"We are Americans in terrible distress! You\r\nunderstand us--you, alone, of all these people here. Save us, if you\r\ncan!\"\r\n\r\nThe patriarch shook his head, where still some sparse and feeble hairs\r\nclung, snowy-white.\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" he answered, intelligibly, yet still with that strange,\r\nhesitant accent of his--\"alas, what can I do? I am sent to you,\r\nverily, on a different mission. They do not understand, my people.\r\nThey have forgotten all. They have fallen back into the night of\r\nignorance. I alone remember; I only know. They mock me. But they fear\r\nme, also.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, woman!\"--and, dropping his staff a-clatter to the floor, he\r\nstretched out a quivering hand--\"oh, woman! and oh, man from\r\nabove--speak! Speak, that I may hear the English from living lips!\"\r\n\r\nStern, blinking with astonishment there in the half-gloom, drew near.\r\n\r\n\"English?\" he queried. \"Haven't you ever heard it spoken?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never! Yet, all my life, here in this lost place, have I studied and\r\ndreamed of that ancient tongue. Our race once spoke it. Now it is\r\nlost. That magnificent language, so rich and pure, all lost, forever\r\nlost! And we--\"\r\n\r\n\"But what _do_ you speak down here?\" exclaimed the engineer, with\r\neager interest. \"It seemed to me I could almost catch something of it;\r\nbut when it came down to the real meaning, I couldn't. If we could\r\nonly talk with these people here, your people, they might give us some\r\nkind of a show! Tell me!\"\r\n\r\n\"A--a show?\" queried the blind man, shaking his head and laying his\r\nother hand on Stern's shoulder. \"Verily, I cannot comprehend. An\r\nentertainment, you mean? Alas, no, friends; they are not hospitable,\r\nmy people. I fear me; I fear me greatly that--that--\"\r\n\r\nHe did not finish, but stood there blinking his sightless eyes, as\r\nthough with some vast effort of the will he might gain knowledge of\r\ntheir features. Then, very deftly, he ran his fingers over Stern's\r\nbearded face. Upon the engineer's lips his digits paused a second.\r\n\r\n\"Living English!\" he breathed in an awed voice. \"These lips speak it\r\nas a living language! Oh, tell me, friends, _are_ there now men of\r\nyour race--once our race--still living, up yonder? _Is_ there such a\r\nplace--is there a sky, a sun, moon, stars--verily such things now? Or\r\nis this all, as my people say, deriding me, only the babbling of old\r\nwives' tales?\"\r\n\r\nA thousand swift, conflicting thoughts seemed struggling in Stern's\r\nmind. Here, there, he seemed to catch a lucid bit; but for the moment\r\nhe could analyze nothing of these swarming impressions.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to see in this strange ancient-of-days some last and\r\nlingering relic of a former generation of the Folk of the Abyss, a\r\nrelic to whom perhaps had been handed down, through countless\r\ngenerations, some vague and wildly distorted traditions of the days\r\nbefore the cataclysm. A relic who still remembered a little English,\r\narchaic, formal, mispronounced, but who, with the tenacious memory of\r\nthe very aged, still treasured a few hundred words of what to him was\r\nbut a dead and forgotten tongue. A relic, still longing for knowledge\r\nof the outer world--still striving to keep alive in the degenerated\r\npeople some spark of memory of all that once had been!\r\n\r\nAnd as this realization, not yet very clear, but seemingly certain in\r\nits general form, dawned on the engineer, a sudden interest in the\r\nproblem and the tragedy of it all sprang up in him, so keen, so\r\npoignant in its appeal to his scientific sense, that for a moment it\r\nquite banished his distress and his desire for escape with Beatrice.\r\n\r\n\"Why, girl,\" he cried, \"here's a case parallel, in real life, to the\r\nwildest imaginings of fiction! It's as though a couple of ancient\r\nRomans had walked in upon some old archeologist who'd given his life\r\nto studying primitive Latin! Only you'd have to imagine he was the\r\nonly man in the world who remembered a word of Latin at all! Can you\r\ngrasp it? No wonder he's overcome!\r\n\r\n\"Gad! If we work this right,\" he added in a swift aside, \"this will be\r\ngood for a return ticket, all right!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man withdrew his hand from the grasp of Beatrice and folded\r\nboth arms across his breast with simple dignity.\r\n\r\n\"I rejoice that I have lived to this time,\" he stammered slowly,\r\ngropingly, as though each word, each distorted and mispronounced\r\nsyllable had to be sought with difficulty. \"I am glad that I have\r\nlived to touch you and to hear your voices. To know it is no mere\r\ntradition, but that, verily, there _was_ such a race and such a\r\nlanguage! The rest also, must be true--the earth, and the sun, and\r\neverything! Oh, this is a wonder and a miracle! Now I can die in a\r\ngreat peace, and they will know I have spoken truth to their mocking!\"\r\n\r\nHe kept silence a space, and the two captives looked fixedly at him,\r\nstrangely moved. On his withered cheeks they could see, by the dull\r\nbluish glow through the doorway, tears still wet. The long and\r\nvenerable beard of spotless white trembled as it fell freely over the\r\ncoarse mantle.\r\n\r\n\"What a subject for a painter--if there were any painters left!\"\r\nthought Stern.\r\n\r\nThe old man's lips moved again.\r\n\r\n\"Now I can go in peace to my appointed place in the Great Vortex,\"\r\nsaid he, and bowed his head, and whispered something in that other\r\nspeech they had already heard but could not understand.\r\n\r\nStern spoke first.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we call your name, father?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"Call me J'hungaav,\" he answered, pronouncing a name which neither of\r\nthem could correctly imitate. When they had tried he asked:\r\n\r\n\"And yours?\"\r\n\r\nStern gave both the girl's and his own. The old man caught them both\r\nreadily enough, though with a very different accent.\r\n\r\n\"Now, see here, father,\" the engineer resumed, \"you'll pardon us, I\r\nknow. There's a million things to talk about. A million we want to\r\nask, and that we can tell you! But we're very tired. We're hungry.\r\nThirsty. Understand? We've just been through a terrible experience.\r\nYou can't grasp it yet; but I'll tell you we've fallen, God knows how\r\nfar, in an aeroplane--\"\r\n\r\n\"Fallen? In an--an--\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter. We've fallen from the surface. From the world where\r\nthere's a sky, and sun, and stars, and all the rest of it. So far as\r\nwe know, this woman and I are the only two people--the original kind\r\nof people, I mean; the people of the time before--er--hang it!--it's\r\nmighty hard to explain!\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand. You are the only two now living of our former race? And\r\nyou have come from above? Verily, this is strange!\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet it is! I mean, verily. And now we re here, your people have\r\nthrown us into this prison, or whatever it is. And we don't like the\r\nlook of those skeletons on the iron rods outside a little bit! We--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I pray! I pray!\" exclaimed the patriarch, thrusting out both\r\nhands. \"Speak not of those! Not yet!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, father. What we want to ask is for something to eat and\r\ndrink, some other kind of clothes than the furs we're wearing, and a\r\nplace to sleep--a house, you know--we've got to rest! We mean no harm\r\nto your people. Wouldn't hurt a hair of their heads! Overjoyed to find\r\n'em! Now, I ask you, as man to man, can't you get us out of this, and\r\nmanage things so that we shall have a chance to explain?\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you the whole story, once we've recuperated. You can\r\ntranslate it to your people. I ask some consideration for myself, and\r\nI _demand_ it for this woman! Well?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man stood in silent thought a moment. Plain to see, his\r\ndistress was very keen. His face wrinkled still more, and on his\r\nbreast he bowed his majestic head, so eloquent of pain and sorrow and\r\nlong disappointment.\r\n\r\nStern, watching him narrowly, played his trump-card.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said he, \"I don't know why you were sent here to talk with\r\nus, or how they knew you _could_ talk with us even. I don't know what\r\nany of this treatment means. But I _do_ know that this girl and I are\r\nfrom the world of a thousand years ago--the world in which your\r\nancient forefathers used to dwell!\r\n\r\n\"She and I know all about that world. We know the language which to\r\nyou is only a precious memory, to us a living fact. We can tell you\r\nhundreds, thousands of things! We can teach you everything you want to\r\nknow! For a year--if you people _have_ years down here--we can sit and\r\ntalk to you, and instruct you, and make you far, far wiser than any of\r\nyour Folk!\r\n\r\n\"More, we can teach your Folk the arts of peace and war--a multitude\r\nof wonderful and useful things. We can raise them from barbarism to\r\ncivilization again! We can save them--save the world! And I appeal to\r\nyou, in the name of all the great and mighty past which to you is\r\nstill a memory, if not to them--_save us now!_\"\r\n\r\nHe ceased. The old man sighed deeply, and for a while kept silence.\r\nHis face might have served as the living personification of intense\r\nand hopeless woe.\r\n\r\nStern had an idea.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" he added--\"here, take this weapon in your hand!\" He thrust\r\nthe automatic into the patriarch's fingers. \"This is a revolver. Have\r\nyou ever heard that word? With this, and other weapons even stronger,\r\nour race, your race, used to fight. It can kill men at a distance in a\r\ntwinkling of an eye. It is swift and very powerful! Let this be the\r\nproof that we are what we say, survivors from the time that was! And\r\nin the name of that great day, and in the name of what we still can\r\nbring to pass for you and yours, save us from whatever evil\r\nthreatens!\"\r\n\r\nA moment the old man held the revolver. Then, shuddering as with a\r\nsudden chill, he thrust it back at Stern.\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" cried he. \"What am I against a thousand? A thousand, sunk in\r\nignorance and fear and hate? A thousand who mock at me? Who believe\r\nyou, verily, to be only some new and stronger kind of Lanskaarn, as we\r\ncall our ancient enemies on the great islands in the sea.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do? They have let me have speech with you merely because\r\nthey think me so old and so childish! Because they say my brain is\r\nsoft! Whatever I may tell them, they will only mock. Woe upon me that\r\nI have known this hour! That I have heard this ancient tongue, only\r\nnow forever to lose it! That I know the truth! That I know the world\r\nof old tradition _was_ true and _is_ true, only now to have no more,\r\nafter this moment, any hope ever to learn about it!\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil you say!\" cried Stern, with sudden anger. \"You mean they\r\nwon't listen to reason? You mean they're planning to butcher us, and\r\nhang us up there along with the rest of the captured Lanskaarns, or\r\nwhatever you call them? You mean they're going to take us--_us_, the\r\nonly chance they've got ever to get out of this, and stick us like a\r\ncouple of pigs, eh? Well, by God! You tell them--you tell--\"\r\n\r\nIn the doorway appeared another form, armed with an iron spear. Came a\r\nquick word of command.\r\n\r\nWith a cry of utter hopelessness and heartbreak, a wail that seemed to\r\npierce the very soul, the patriarch turned and stumbled to the door.\r\n\r\nHe paused. He turned, and, stretching out both feeble arms to them--to\r\nthem, who meant so infinitely much to him, so absolutely nothing to\r\nhis barbarous race--cried:\r\n\r\n\"Fare you well, O godlike people of that better time! Fare you well!\r\nBefore another tide has risen on our accursed black beach, verily both\r\nof you, the last survivors--\"\r\n\r\nWith a harsh word of anger, the spearsman thrust him back and away.\r\n\r\nStern leaped forward, revolver leveled.\r\n\r\nBut before he could pull trigger the iron door had clanged shut.\r\n\r\nOnce more darkness swallowed them.\r\n\r\nBlack though it was, it equaled not the blackness of their absolute\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE IN THE DARK\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a time no word passed between them. Stern took the girl in\r\nhis arms and comforted her as best he might; but his heart told him\r\nthere was now no hope.\r\n\r\nThe old man had spoken only too truly. There existed no way of\r\nconvincing these barbarians that their prisoners were not of some\r\nhated, hostile tribe. Evidently the tradition of the outer world had\r\nlong since perished as a belief among them. The patriarch's faith in\r\nit had come to be considered a mere doting second childhood vagary,\r\njust as the tradition of the Golden Age was held to be by the later\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\nThat Stern and Beatrice could in any way convince their captors of the\r\ntruth of this outer world and establish their identity as real\r\nsurvivors of the other time, lay wholly outside the bounds of the\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nAnd as the old man's prophecy of evil--interrupted, yet frightfully\r\nominous--recurred to Stern's mind, he knew the end of everything was\r\nvery close at hand.\r\n\r\n\"They won't get us, though, without a stiff fight, damn them!\" thought\r\nhe. \"That's one satisfaction. If they insist on extermination--if they\r\nwant war--they'll get it, all right enough! And it'll be what Sherman\r\nsaid war always was, too--_Hell!_\"\r\n\r\nCame now a long, a seemingly interminable wait. The door remained\r\nfast-barred. Oppression, heat, thirst, hunger tortured them, but\r\nrelief there was none.\r\n\r\nAnd at length the merciful sleep of stupefaction overcame them; and\r\nall their pain, their anguish and forebodings were numbed into a\r\nwelcome oblivion.\r\n\r\nThey were awakened by a confused noise--the sound of cries and shouts,\r\ndulled by the thick walls, yet evidently many-voiced--harsh commands,\r\nyells, and even some few sharp blows upon the prison stones.\r\n\r\nThe engineer started up, wide-eyed and all alert now in the gloom.\r\n\r\nGone were his lassitude, his weakness and his sense of pain. Every\r\nsense acute, he waited, hand clutching the pistol-butt, finger on\r\ntrigger.\r\n\r\n\"Ready there, Beatrice!\" cried he. \"Something's started at last! Maybe\r\nit's our turn now. Here, get behind me--but be ready to shoot when I\r\ntell you! Steady now, steady for the attack!\"\r\n\r\nTense as coiled springs they waited. And all at once a bar slid,\r\ncreaking. Around the edge of the metal door a thin blue line of light\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n\"_Stand back, you!_\" yelled Stern. \"The first man through that door's\r\na dead one!\"\r\n\r\nThe line of light remained a moment narrow, then suddenly it\r\nbroadened. From without a pandemonium of sound burst in--howls,\r\nshrieks, imprecations, cries of pain.\r\n\r\nEven in that perilous moment a quick wonder darted through Stern's\r\nbrain, what the meaning of this infernal tumult might be, and just\r\nwhat ghastly fate was to be theirs--what torments and indignities they\r\nmight still have to face before the end.\r\n\r\n\"Remember, Beatrice,\" he commanded, \"if I'm killed, use the revolver\r\non yourself before you let them take you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know!\" she cried. And, crouching beside him in the half light, she,\r\ntoo, awaited what seemed the inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe door swung open.\r\n\r\nThere stood the patriarch again, arms extended, face eager with a\r\npassionate hope and longing, a great pride even at that strange and\r\npregnant moment.\r\n\r\n\"Peace, friends!\" he cried. \"I give you peace! Strike me not down with\r\nthose terrible weapons of yours! For verily I bring you hope again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hope? What d'you mean?\" shouted Stern.\r\n\r\nThrough the opened door he caught vague glimpses in the luminous fog\r\nof many spearmen gathered near--of excited gestures and the wild\r\nwaving of arms--of other figures that, half seen, ran swiftly here and\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\"Speak up, you! What's the matter? What's wanted?\" demanded the\r\nengineer, keeping his automatic sighted at the doorway. \"What's all\r\nthis infernal row? If your people there think they're going to play\r\nhorse with us, they're mightily mistaken! You tell them the first man\r\nthat steps through that door to get us never'll take another step!\r\n_Quick! What's up?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" answered the aged man, his voice high and tremulous above the\r\nhowling tumult and the roar of the great gas-well. \"Come, now! The\r\n_Lanskaarn_--they attack! _Come!_ I have spoken of your weapons to my\r\npeople. _Come, fight for us!_ And verily, if we win--\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of a trick are you putting up on us, anyhow?\" roared Stern\r\nwith thrice-heated rage. \"None o' that now! If your people want us,\r\nlet 'em come in here and get us! But as for being fooled that way and\r\ntricked into coming out--\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear the truth!\" supplicated the patriarch, raising his withered\r\nhand on high. \"If you come not, you must verily die, oh, friends! But\r\nif you come--\"\r\n\r\n\"Your own life's the first to pay for any falsehood now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I give it gladly! _The truth, I swear it!_ Oh, listen, while there is\r\nstill time, and come! _Come!_\"\r\n\r\n\"What about it, girl?\" cried Stern. \"Are you with me? Will you take a\r\nchance on it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing else to do, Allan. They've got us, anyway. And--and I\r\nthink the old man's telling the truth. Hear _that_, now--\"\r\n\r\nOff somewhere toward the fortification wall that edged the beach,\r\nsounds of indisputable conflict were arising. The howls, cries,\r\nshrieks, blows were not to be mistaken.\r\n\r\nStern's resolution was instant.\r\n\r\n\"I'm with you, old man!\" he shouted. \"But remember your promise. And\r\nif you fail me--it's your finish!\r\n\r\n\"Come, Beta! Stick close to me! If we fall, we'll go down together.\r\nIt's both or neither. _Come on--come on!_\"\r\n\r\nOut into the glare of the great flame they issued warily, out into the\r\nstrangely glowing mist that covered the incredible village as with a\r\nvirescent pall.\r\n\r\nBlinking, they stared about them, not knowing for a moment whither to\r\nrun or where to shoot.\r\n\r\nBut the patriarch had Stern by the arm now; and in the midst of a\r\nconfused and shouting mass of the Folk--all armed with spears and\r\nslings, knobbed clubs and battle-maces--was pushing him out through\r\nthe circle of those ghastly posts whence dangled the headless\r\nskeletons.\r\n\r\n\"Where? Which way?\" cried Stern. \"Show me--I'll do the rest!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thither!\" the old man directed, pointing with one hand, while with\r\nthe other he shoved the engineer forward. Blind though he was, he knew\r\nthe right direction. \"_Thither--to the wall!_\"\r\n\r\nFor a second Stern had the thought of leaving Beatrice in the cell,\r\nwhere she might at least be safe from the keen peril of battle; but\r\ngreater dangers threatened her, he knew, in his absence.\r\n\r\nAt all hazards they must keep together. And with a cry: \"Come!\r\nCome--stick close to me!\" once more he broke into a run toward the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThrough the mists, which grew darker as he neared the wall with\r\nBeatrice close beside him and the troop that followed them, he could\r\ncatch glimpses of the battle.\r\n\r\nEvery hut seemed to have poured forth its inhabitants for now the\r\nplaza swarmed with life--men, women, event children, running this way\r\nand that, some with weapons rushing towards the wall, others running\r\nwildly hither and yon with unintelligible cries.\r\n\r\nA spear pierced the vapors; it fell clashing at Stern's feet and slid\r\nrattling away over the black stones, worn smooth and greasy by\r\nuncounted feet.\r\n\r\nPast him as he ran a man staggered; the whole side of his head was\r\nbashed in, as though by a frightful blow from a mace. Up the wounded\r\nman flung both arms, and fell twitching.\r\n\r\nThe fog covered him with its drifting folds. Stern shuddered that\r\nBeatrice should see such hideous sights; but even now he almost fell\r\nover another prostrate body, hideously wounded in the back, and still\r\nkicking.\r\n\r\n\"Ready, now!\" panted Stern. \"Ready with the pistols!\"\r\n\r\nWhere was the patriarch?\r\n\r\nHe no longer knew. About him the Folk pressed, but none molested\r\neither him or Beatrice.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion, the rush of the outskirts of battle, he could have\r\nshot down a score of them, but he was reserving his fire. It might,\r\nperhaps, be true, who could tell--that safety lay in battling now\r\nagainst the Lanskaarn!\r\n\r\nAll at once the captives saw vague fire-lights in the gloom--seemingly\r\nblazing comets of blue, that tossed and hurled and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThen came the nearer sound of shouting and the clash of arms.\r\n\r\nStern, with the atavistic instincts of even the most civilized man,\r\nscented the kill. And with a roar he whirled into the confused and\r\nsweltering mass of men which now, emerging from the darkening mists,\r\nhad suddenly become visible by the uncanny light of the cressets on\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\nBeside him the girl, her face aglow, nostrils dilated, breath quick,\r\nheld her revolver ready.\r\n\r\nAnd then, quite suddenly, they found themselves at the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Shoot! Shoot!\" bellowed Stern, and let drive, pointblank, at an ugly,\r\ngrinning face that like a nightmare-vision all at once projected over\r\nthe crest. His own revolver-fire was echoed by hers. The face\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nAll down there, below him on the beach, he caught a dim, confused\r\nimpression of the attacking swarm.\r\n\r\nSubconsciously he realized that he--he a man of the twentieth\r\ncentury--was witnessing again a scene such as made the whole history\r\nof the Middle Ages sanguinary--a siege, by force of human strength and\r\nrage!\r\n\r\nEven as he vaguely saw the swift and supple men, white-skinned yet\r\nlarger than the Folk, which crowded the whole beach as far as he could\r\npierce the mists with his straining sight, he knew that here was a\r\nbattle of huge scope and terrible danger.\r\n\r\nUp from the sea the attackers, the Lanskaarn, were swarming, from\r\ntheir dimly seen canoes. The place was alive with them.\r\n\r\nAt the base of the wall they were clotted in dense hordes; and\r\nsiege-ladders were being raised; and now up the ladders the lithe men\r\nof darkness were running like so many ants.\r\n\r\nAutomatically as the mechanism of his own gun which he pumped into\r\nthat dense mass as fast as he could pull trigger--while beside him the\r\ngirl was shooting hard and straight, as well--he seemed to be\r\nrecording these wonderful impressions.\r\n\r\nHere he caught a glimpse of a siege-ladder hurled backward by the\r\nFolk, backward and down to the beach. Amid frightful yells and screams\r\nit fell; and a score of crushed and mangled men lay writhing there\r\nunder the uncanny glare of the cressets.\r\n\r\nThere he saw fire-bales being hurled down from the walls--these, the\r\ncomet-like apparitions he had seen from a distance--hurled, blazing,\r\nright into the brown of the mob.\r\n\r\nBeyond, a party had scaled the wall, and there the fight was hand to\r\nhand--with gruntings, thrustings of spears, slashings of long knives\r\nthat dripped red and cut again and rose and fell with hideous\r\nregularity!\r\n\r\nHe jacked his pistol full of shells once more and thrust it into the\r\ngirl's hand--for she, excited beyond all control, was snapping the\r\nhammer of her weapon on empty steel.\r\n\r\n\"Give it to 'em! Shoot! Kill!\" he yelled. \"Our only chance now! If\r\nthey--get in--we're dead!\"\r\n\r\nHe snatched her weapon, reloaded, and again rained the steel-jacketed\r\nbolts of death against the attackers.\r\n\r\nIn the tumult and wild maelstrom of the fight the revolvers' crackling\r\nseemed to produce little effect. If Stern expected that this unknown\r\nweapon would at once bring panic and quick victory he reckoned without\r\nthe berserker madness and the stern mettle of this horde of raging\r\nLanskaarn.\r\n\r\nWhite men, like himself, they yielded not; but with strange cries and\r\nfrightful yells, pressed on and on, up to the walls, and up the\r\nladders ever; and now came flights of spears, hissing through the dark\r\nair--and now smooth black rocks from the beach, flung with terrible\r\nstrength and skill by the slingers below, mowed down the defenders.\r\n\r\nHere, there, men of the Folk were falling, pierced by the iron spears,\r\nshattered by the swift and heavy rocks.\r\n\r\nThe place was becoming a shambles where the blood of attackers and\r\nattacked mingled horribly in the gloom.\r\n\r\nOne ladder, pushed outward, dragged half a dozen of the Merucaans with\r\nit; and at the bottom of the wall a circling eddy of the Lanskaarn\r\ndespatched the fighting Folkmen who had been hauled to their\r\ndestruction by the grappling besiegers.\r\n\r\nBlows, howls and screams, hurtling fire-bales and great rocks flung\r\nfrom above--the rocks he had already noted laid along the inside of\r\nthe wall--these, and the smell of blood and fire, the horrid, sweaty\r\ncontact of struggling bodies, the press and jam of the battle that\r\nsurged round them, all gave Stern a kaleidoscopic picture of war--war\r\nas it once was, in the long ago--war, naked and terrible, such as he\r\nhad never even dreamed!\r\n\r\nBut, mad with the lust of the kill, he heeded nothing now.\r\n\r\n\"Shoot! Shoot!\" he kept howling, beside himself; and, tearing open the\r\nbandoliers where lay his cartridges, he crammed them with feverish\r\nfingers into the girl's weapon and his own--weapons now burning hot\r\nwith the quick, long-continued firing.\r\n\r\nThe battle seemed to dance, to waver there before his eyes, in the\r\nhaze of mist and smoke and stifling air. The dark scene, blue-lit by\r\nthe guttering torches, grew ever more sanguinary, more incredibly\r\nhideous. And still the attackers swarmed along the walls and up them,\r\nin front and on both sides, till the swirling mists hid them and the\r\ndefenders from view.\r\n\r\nHe heard Beatrice cry out with pain. He saw her stagger and fall back.\r\n\r\nTo her he leaped.\r\n\r\n\"Wounded?\" he gasped.\r\n\r\nShe answered nothing, but fell limp.\r\n\r\n\"God of Battles!\" he howled. \"Revenge!\"\r\n\r\nHe snatched her automatic from beneath the trampling, crowding feet;\r\nhe bore her back, away from the thick press. And in the shelter of a\r\nmassive hut he laid her down.\r\n\r\nThen, stark-mad, he turned and leaped into the battle-line that swayed\r\nand screamed along the wall.\r\n\r\nCritical now the moment. In half a dozen places the besiegers had\r\ngot their ladders planted. And, while dense masses of the\r\nLanskaarn--unminding fire-balls and boulders rained down upon\r\nthem--held these ladders firm, up the attackers came with a rush.\r\n\r\nStern saw the swing and crushing impact of the maces and iron clubs;\r\nhe saw the stabbing of the spears on both sides.\r\n\r\nSlippery and red the parapet became.\r\n\r\nMen, killed there, crawled and struggled and fell both outward and\r\ninside, and were trampled in indiscriminate heaps, besieged and\r\nbesiegers alike, still clawing, tearing, howling even in their death\r\nagony.\r\n\r\nNow one of the ladders was down--another fell, with horrid tumult--a\r\nthird!\r\n\r\nAn automatic in each hand, Stern scrambled to the glairy summit of the\r\nfortification.\r\n\r\nA mace swung at him. He leaped sidewise, firing as he sprang. With a\r\nscream the ax-man doubled up and fell, and vanished in the gloom below\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\nRaking the parapet with a hail of lead, he mowed down the attackers on\r\ntop of the fourth ladder. With a mighty shout, those inside staved it\r\naway with iron grapples. It, too, swayed drunkenly, held below, pushed\r\nmadly above. It reeled--then fell with a horrible, grinding crash!\r\n\r\n\"Hurray, boys! One more down! Give 'em Hell!\" he screamed. \"One more!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned. Subconsciously he felt that his right hand was wet, and\r\nhot, and dripping, but he felt no pain.\r\n\r\n\"One more! Now for another!\"\r\n\r\nAnd in the opposite direction along the wall he emptied his other\r\nrevolver.\r\n\r\nBefore the stinging swarm of the steel-jacketed wasps of death the\r\nLanskaarn writhed and melted down with screams such as Dante in his\r\nwildest vision never even dreamed.\r\n\r\nStern heard a great howl of triumph break from the mass of defenders\r\nfighting to overthrow the fifth ladder.\r\n\r\n\"Hold 'em! Hold 'em!\" he bellowed. \"Wait till I load up again--I'll--\"\r\n\r\nA swift and crashing impact dashed sheaves of radiant fire through his\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nEverything leaped and whirled.\r\n\r\nHe flung up both hands.\r\n\r\nClutching at empty air, then suddenly at the slippery parapet which\r\nseemed to have leaped up and struck him in the face, he fell.\r\n\r\nCame a strange numbness, then a stabbing pain.\r\n\r\nAnd darkness quenched all knowledge and all consciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nSHADOWS OF WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nA blue and flickering gleam of light, dim, yet persistent,\r\nseemed to enhalo a woman's face; and as Stern's weary eyes opened\r\nunder languid lids, closed, then opened again, the wounded engineer\r\nsmiled in his weakness.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice!\" he whispered, and tried to stretch a hand to her, as she\r\nsat beside his bed of seaweed covered with the coarse brown fabric.\r\n\"Oh, Beatrice! Is this--is this another--hallucination?\"\r\n\r\nShe took the hand and kissed it, then bent above him and kissed him\r\nagain, this time fair upon the lips.\r\n\r\n\"No, boy,\" she answered. \"No hallucination, but reality! You're all\r\nright now--and _I'm_ all right! You've had a little fever\r\nand--and--well, don't ask any questions, that's all. Here, drink this\r\nnow and go to sleep!\"\r\n\r\nShe set a massive golden bowl to his mouth, and very gently raised his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nUnquestioningly he drank, as though he had been a child and she his\r\nmother. The liquid, warm and somewhat sweet, had just a tang of some\r\nnew taste that he had never known. Singularly vitalizing it seemed,\r\nsoothing yet full of life. With a sigh of contentment, despite the\r\nnumb ache in his right temple, he lay back and once more closed his\r\neyes. Never had he felt such utter weakness. All his forces seemed\r\ndrained and spent; even to breathe was very difficult.\r\n\r\nFeebly he raised his hand to his head.\r\n\r\n\"Bandaged?\" he whispered. \"What does _that_ mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It means you're to go to sleep now!\" she commanded. \"That's all--just\r\ngo to sleep!\"\r\n\r\nHe lay quiet a moment, but sleep would not come. A score, a hundred\r\nthoughts confusedly crowded his brain.\r\n\r\nAnd once more looking up at her in the dim blue gloom of the hut where\r\nthey were, he breathed a question:\r\n\r\n\"Were you badly hurt, dear, in--in the battle?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Allan. Just stunned, that's all. Not even wounded. Be quiet now\r\nor I'll scold!\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his arms to her and, weak though he was, took her to his\r\nbreast and held her tight, tight.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" he whispered. \"Oh, I love you! I love you so! If you'd\r\nbeen killed--\"\r\n\r\nShe felt his tears hot upon his wasted cheeks, and unloosened his\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\"There, there!\" she soothed him. \"You'll get into a fever again if you\r\ndon't lie still and try not to think! You--\"\r\n\r\n\"When was it? Yesterday?\" he interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Sh-h-h-h! No more questions now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I want to know! And what happened to me? And the--the Lanskaarn?\r\nWhat about them? And--\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens, but you're inquisitive for a man that's just missed--I mean,\r\nthat's been as sick as you have!\" she exclaimed, taking his head in\r\nboth hands and gazing down at him with eyes more deeply tender than he\r\nhad ever seen them. \"Now do be good, boy, and don't worry about all\r\nthese things, but go to sleep--there's a dear. And when you wake up\r\nnext time--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" he insisted with passionate eagerness. \"I'm not that kind!\r\nI'm not a child, Beta! I've got to know--I can't go to sleep without\r\nknowing. Tell me a little about it, about what happened, and\r\nthen--then I'll sleep as long as you say!\"\r\n\r\nShe pondered a moment, weighing matters, then made answer:\r\n\r\n\"All right, boy, only remember your promise!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! Now listen. I'll tell you what the old man told me, for\r\nnaturally I don't remember the last part of the fight any better than\r\nyou do.\r\n\r\n\"I was struck by a flying stone, and--well, it wasn't anything\r\nserious. It just stunned me for a while. I came to in a hut.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where I carried you, dearest, just before I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know, just before the battle-ax--\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it an ax that hit me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But it was only a glancing blow. Your long hair helped save you,\r\ntoo. But even so--\"\r\n\r\n\"Skull cracked?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I guess concussion of the brain would be the right term for it.\"\r\nShe took his groping hand in both her own warm, strong ones and kissed\r\nit tenderly. \"But before you fell, your raking fire along the wall\r\nthere--you understand--\"\r\n\r\n\"Cleaned 'em out, eh?\" he queried eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"That's about it. It turned the tide against the Lanskaarn. And after\r\nthat--I guess it was just butchery. I don't know, of course, and the\r\nold man hasn't wanted to tell me much; but anyway, the ladders all\r\nwent down, and the Folk here made a sortie from the gate, down the\r\ncauseway, and--and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And they've got a lot more of those infernal skeletons hanging on the\r\npoles by the fire?\" he concluded in a rasping whisper.\r\n\r\nShe nodded, then kept a minute's silence.\r\n\r\n\"Did any of 'em get away in their canoes?\"\r\n\r\n\"A few. But in all their history the Folk never won such a victory.\r\nOh, it was glorious, glorious! And all because of you!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, dear!\"\r\n\r\n\"And now--now,\" she went on, \"we're not prisoners any more, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything coming our way? Is that it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it. They dragged you out, after the battle, from under a big\r\nheap of bodies under the wall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Outside or inside?\"\r\n\r\n\"Outside, on the beach. They brought you in, for dead, boy. And I\r\nguess they had an awful time about you, from what I've found out--\"\r\n\r\n\"Big powwow, and all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. If you'd died, they'd have gone on a huge war expedition out to\r\nthe islands, wherever those are, and simply wiped out the rest of the\r\nLanskaarn. But--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad I didn't,\" he interrupted. \"No more killing from now on! We\r\nwant all the living humans we can get; we need 'em in our business!\"\r\n\r\nStern was growing excited; the girl had to calm him once more.\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet, Allan, or I'll leave you this minute and you shan't know\r\nanother thing!\" she threatened.\r\n\r\n\"All right, I'll be good,\" he promised. \"What next? I'm the Big Chief\r\nnow, of course? What I say now _goes?_\"\r\n\r\nShe answered nothing, but a troubled wrinkle drew between her perfect\r\nbrows. For a moment there was silence, save for the dull and distant\r\nroaring of the flame.\r\n\r\nBy the glow of the bluish light in the hut, Stern looked up at her.\r\nNever had she seemed so beautiful. The heavy masses of her hair,\r\nparted in the middle and fastened with gold pins such as the Folk\r\nwore, framed her wonderful face with twilight shadows. He saw she was\r\nno longer clad in fur, but in a loose and flowing mantle of the brown\r\nfabric, caught up below the breast with a gold-clasped girdle.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Beatrice,\" he breathed, \"kiss me again!\"\r\n\r\nShe kissed him; but even in the caress he sensed an unvoiced anxiety,\r\na hidden fear.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asked he anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, dear. Now you _must_ be quiet! You're in the patriarch's\r\nhouse here. You're safe--for the present, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"For the present? What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"See here.\" the girl threatened, \"if you don't stop asking questions,\r\nand go to sleep again, I'll leave you alone!\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case I promise!\"\r\n\r\nAnd now obedient, he closed his eyes, relaxed, and let her soothingly\r\ncaress him. But still another thought obtruded on his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dearest.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long ago was that fight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a little while. Never mind now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but how long? Two days? Four? Five?\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't have days down here,\" she evaded.\r\n\r\n\"I know. But reckoning our way--five days?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nearer ten, Allan.\"\r\n\r\n\"_What?_ But then--\"\r\n\r\nThe girl withdrew her hand from him and arose.\r\n\r\n\"I see it's no use, Allan,\" she said decisively. \"So long as I stay\r\nwith you you'll ask questions and excite yourself. I'm going! Then\r\nyou'll _have_ to keep still!\"\r\n\r\n\"Beta! Beta!\" he implored. \"I'll be good! Don't leave me--you\r\n_mustn't!_\"\r\n\r\n\"All right; but if you ask me another question, a single one, mind,\r\nI'll truly go!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just give me your hand, girlie, that's all! Come here--sit down\r\nbeside me again--so!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned on his side, on the rude couch of coarse brown fabric\r\nstuffed with dried seaweed, laid his hollow cheek upon her hand, and\r\ngave a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I'm off,\" he murmured. \"Only, don't leave me, Beta!\"\r\n\r\nFor half an hour after his deep, slow breathing told that the wounded\r\nman was sleeping soundly--half an hour as time was measured where the\r\nsun shone, for down in the black depths of the abyss all such\r\ndivisions were as naught, Beatrice sat lovingly and tenderly beside\r\nthe primitive bed. Her right palm beneath his face, she stroked his\r\nlong hair and his wan cheek with her other hand; and now she smiled\r\nwith pride and reminiscence, now a grave, troubled look crossed her\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nThe light, a fiber wick burning in a stone cup of oil upon a\r\nstone-slab table in the center of the hut, \"uttered unsteadily,\r\ncasting huge and dancing shadows up the black walls.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my beloved!\" whispered the girl, and bent above him till the\r\nloosened sheaves of her hair swept his face. \"My love! Only for you,\r\nwhere should I be now? With you, how could I be afraid? And yet--\"\r\n\r\nShe turned at a sound from a narrow door opposite the larger one that\r\ngave upon the plaza, a door, like the other, closed by a heavy curtain\r\nplatted of seaweed.\r\n\r\nThere, holding the curtain back, stood the blind patriarch. His hut,\r\nlarger than most in the strange village, boasted two rooms. Now from\r\nthe inner one, where he had been resting, he came to speak with\r\nBeatrice.\r\n\r\n\"Peace, daughter!\" said the old man. \"Peace be unto you. He sleeps?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father. He's much better now, I think. His constitution is\r\nsimply marvelous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Verily, he is strong. But far stronger are those terrible and\r\nwonderful weapons of yours! If our Folk only had such!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're better off without them. But of course, if you want to\r\nunderstand them, he can explain them in due time. Those, and endless\r\nother things!\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that is truth.\" The patriarch advanced into the room, and\r\nfor a minute stood by the bedside with venerable dignity. \"The\r\ntraditions, I remember, tell of so many strange matters. I shall know\r\nthem, every one. All in time, all in time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your simple medicines, down here, are wonderful,\" said the girl\r\nadmiringly. \"What did you put into that draught I gave him to make him\r\nsleep this way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only the steeped root of our _n'gahar_ plant, my daughter--a simple\r\nweed brought up from the bottom of this sea by our strong divers. It\r\nis nothing, nothing.\"\r\n\r\nCame silence again. The aged man sat down upon a curved stone bench\r\nthat followed the contour of the farther wall. Presently he spoke once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\"Daughter,\" said he, \"it is now ten sleeping--times--nights, the\r\nEnglish speech calls them, if I remember what my grandfather taught\r\nme--since the battle. And my son, here, still lies weak and sick. I go\r\nsoon to get still other plants for him. Stronger plants, to make him\r\nwell and powerful again. For there is haste now--haste!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--Kamrou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yea, Kamrou! I know the temper of that evil man better than any\r\nother. He and his boats may return from the great fisheries in the\r\nWhite Gulf beyond the vortex at any time, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"But, father, after all we've done for the village here, and\r\nespecially after what Allan's done? After this wonderful victory, I\r\ncan't believe--\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not know that man!\" exclaimed the patriarch. \"_I_ know him!\r\nRather would he and his slay every living thing in this community than\r\nyield one smallest atom of power to any other.\"\r\n\r\nHe arose wearily and gathered his mantle all about him, then reached\r\nfor his staff that leaned beside the outer door.\r\n\r\n\"Peace!\" he exclaimed. \"Ah, when shall we have peace and learning and\r\na better life again? The teaching and the learning of the English\r\nspeech and all the arts you know, now lost to us--to us, the abandoned\r\nFolk in the abyss? When? When?\"\r\n\r\nHe raised the curtain to depart; but even then he paused once more,\r\nand turned to her.\r\n\r\n\"Verily, you have spoken truth,\" said he, \"when you have said that\r\nall, all _here_ are with us, with you and this wondrous man now lying\r\nweak and wounded in my house. But Kamrou--is different. Alas, you know\r\nhim not--you know him not!\r\n\r\n\"Watch well over my son, here! Soon must he grow strong again. Soon,\r\nsoon! Soon, against the coming of Kamrou. For if the chief returns and\r\nmy son be weak still, then woe to him, to you, to me! Woe to us all!\r\nWoe, Woe!\"\r\n\r\nThe curtain fell. The patriarch was gone. Outside, Beatrice heard the\r\nclick-click-click of his iron staff upon the smooth and flinty rock\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nAnd to her ears, mingled with the far roaring of the flame, drifted\r\nthe words:\r\n\r\n\"Woe, woe to him! Woe to us all--woe--woe!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the ministering care of Beatrice and the patriarch,\r\nStern's convalescence was rapid. The old man, consumed with terror\r\nlest the dreaded chief, Kamrou, return ere the stranger should have\r\nwholly recovered, spent himself in efforts to hasten the cure. And\r\nwith deft skill he brewed his potions, made his salves, and concocted\r\nrevivifying medicines from minerals which only he--despite his\r\nblindness--knew how to compound.\r\n\r\nThe blow that had so shrewdly clipped Stern's skull must have\r\ninevitably killed, as an ox is dropped in the slaughter-house, a man\r\nless powerfully endowed with splendid energies and full vitality.\r\n\r\nEven Stern's wonderful physique had a hard fight to regain its finely\r\nripened forces. But day by day he gained--we must speak of days,\r\nthough there were only sleeping-times and waking-times--until at\r\nlength, upon the fifth, he was able for the first time to leave his\r\nseaweed bed and sit a while weakly on the patriarch's bench, with\r\nBeatrice beside him.\r\n\r\nHand in hand they sat, while Stern asked many questions, and the old\r\nman, smiling, answered such as he saw fit. But of Kamrou neither he\r\nnor the girl yet breathed one syllable.\r\n\r\nNext day and the next, and so on every day, Stern was able to creep\r\nout of the hut, then walk a little, and finally--sometimes alone,\r\nsometimes with one or both his nurses--go all among the wondering and\r\nadmiring Folk, eagerly watch their labors of all kinds, try to talk\r\nwith them in the few halting words he was able to pick up, and learn\r\nmany things of use and deepest interest. A grave and serious Folk they\r\nwere, almost without games or sports, seemingly without religious\r\nrites of any kind, and lacking festivals such as on the surface every\r\nbarbarous people had always had.\r\n\r\nTheir fisheries, netmaking, weaving, ironwork, sewing with long iron\r\nneedles and coarse fiber-thread keenly interested him. Accustomed now\r\nto the roaring of the flame, he seemed no longer to hear this sound\r\nwhich had at first so sorely disconcerted him.\r\n\r\nHe found out nothing concerning their gold and copper supply; but\r\ntheir oil, he discovered, they collected in pits below the southern\r\nwall of the village, where it accumulated from deep fissures in the\r\nrock. With joy he noted the large number of children, for this bespoke\r\na race still vigorous and with all sorts of possibilities when\r\ntrained.\r\n\r\nOdd little, silent creatures the children were, white-faced and\r\nwhite-haired, playless and grave, laboring like their elders even from\r\nthe age of five or six. They followed him about in little troops,\r\nwatching him soberly; but when he turned and tried to talk with them\r\nthey scurried off like frightened rabbits and vanished in the\r\nalways-open huts of stone.\r\n\r\nThoroughly he explored every nook and corner of the village. As soon\r\nas his strength permitted, he even penetrated parts of the surrounding\r\nregion. He thought at times to detect among the Folk who followed and\r\nsurrounded him, unless he expressly waved them away, some hard looks\r\nhere or there. Instinctively he felt that a few of the people, here\r\none, there one, still held hate and bitterness against him as an alien\r\nand an interloper.\r\n\r\nBut the mass of them now outwardly _seemed_ so eager to serve and care\r\nfor him, so quick to obey, so grateful almost to adoration, that Stern\r\nfelt ashamed of his own suspicions and of the revolver that he still\r\nalways carried whenever outside the patriarch's hut.\r\n\r\nAnd in his heart he buried his fears as unworthy delusions, as the\r\nimaginings of a brain still hurt. The occasional black looks of one or\r\nanother of the people, or perchance some sullen, muttered word, he set\r\ndown as the crude manners of a primitive and barbarous race.\r\n\r\nHow little, despite all his skill and wit, he could foresee the truth!\r\n\r\nTo Beatrice he spoke no word of his occasional uneasiness, nor yet to\r\nthe old man. Yet one of the very first matters he attended to was the\r\noverhauling of the revolvers, which had been rescued out of the melee\r\nof the battle and been given to the patriarch, who had kept them with\r\na kind of religious devotion.\r\n\r\nStern put in half a day cleaning and oiling the weapons. He found\r\nthere still remained a hundred and six cartridges in his bandolier and\r\nthe girl's. These he now looked upon as his most precious treasure. He\r\ndivided them equally with Beatrice, and bade her never go out unless\r\nshe had her weapon securely belted on.\r\n\r\nTheir life at home was simple in the extreme. Beatrice had the inner\r\nroom of the hut for her own. Stern and the patriarch occupied the\r\nouter one. And there, often far into the hours of the sleeping-time,\r\nwhen Beatrice was resting within, he and the old man talked of the\r\nwonders of the past, of the outer world, of old traditions, of the\r\nabyss, and a thousand fascinating speculations.\r\n\r\nParticularly did the old man seek to understand some notions of the\r\nlost machine on which the strangers had come from the outer world;\r\nbut, though Stern tried most patiently to make him grasp the principle\r\nof the mechanism, he failed. This talk, however, set Stern thinking\r\nvery seriously about the biplane; and he asked a score of questions\r\nrelative to the qualities of the native oil, to currents in the sea,\r\nlocations, depths, and so on.\r\n\r\nAll that he could learn he noted mentally with the precision of the\r\ntrained engineer.\r\n\r\nWith accurate scientific observation he at once began to pile up\r\ninformation about the people and the village, the sea, the\r\nabyss--everything, in fact, that he could possibly learn. He felt that\r\neverything depended on a sound understanding of the topography and\r\nnature of the incredible community where he and the girl now found\r\nthemselves--perhaps for a life stay.\r\n\r\nBeatrice and he were clad now like the Folk; wore their hair twisted\r\nin similar fashion and fastened with heavy pins or spikes of gold,\r\ncleverly graven; were shod with sandals like theirs, made of the skin\r\nof a shark-like fish; and carried torches everywhere they\r\nwent--torches of dried weed, close-packed in a metal basket and\r\nimpregnated with oil.\r\n\r\nThis oil particularly interested Stern. Its peculiar blue flame struck\r\nhim as singular in the extreme. It had, moreover, the property of\r\nburning a very long time without being replenished. A wick immersed in\r\nit was never consumed or even charred, though the heat produced was\r\nintense.\r\n\r\n\"If I can't set up some kind of apparatus to distil that into\r\ngas-engine fuel, I'm no engineer, that's all,\" said Stern to himself.\r\n\"All in time, all in time--but first I must take thought how to raise\r\nthe old Pauillac from the sea.\"\r\n\r\nAlready the newcomers' lungs had become absolutely accustomed to the\r\ncondensed air, so that they breathed with entire ease and comfort.\r\nThey even found this air unusually stimulating and revivifying,\r\nbecause of its greater amount of oxygen to the cubic unit; and thus\r\nthey were able to endure greater exertions than formerly on the\r\nsurface of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe air never grew foul. A steady current set in the direction that\r\nStern's pocket-compass indicated as north. The heat no longer\r\noppressed them; they were even getting used to the constant fog and to\r\nthe darkness; and already could see far better than a fortnight\r\npreviously, when they had arrived.\r\n\r\nStern never could have believed he could learn to do without sunlight\r\nand starlight and the free winds of heaven; but now he found that even\r\nthese were not essential to human life.\r\n\r\nCertain phenomena excited his scientific interest very keenly--such as\r\nthe source of the great gas-flare in the village, the rhythmic\r\nvariations in the air-current, the small but well-marked tides on the\r\nsea, the diminished force of gravitation--indicating a very great\r\ndepth, indeed, toward the center of the earth--the greater density of\r\nthe seawater, the heavy vaporization, certain singular rock-strata of\r\nthe cliffs near the village, and many other matters.\r\n\r\nAll these Stern promised himself he would investigate as soon as time\r\nand strength allowed.\r\n\r\nThe village itself, he soon determined, was about half a mile long and\r\nperhaps a quarter-mile across, measuring from the fortified gate\r\ndirectly back to the huge flame near the dungeon and the place of\r\nbones.\r\n\r\nHe found, incidentally, that more than one hundred and sixty freshly\r\nboiled and headless skeletons were now dangling from the iron rods,\r\nbut wisely held his peace concerning them. Nor did the patriarch\r\nvolunteer any information about the loss of life of the Folk in the\r\nbattle. Stern estimated there were now some fifteen hundred people,\r\nmen, women and children, still remaining in the community; but since\r\nhe knew nothing of their number when he had arrived, he could not form\r\nmore than a rough idea of the total slaughter.\r\n\r\nHe found, however, on one of his excursions outside the walls--which\r\nat a distance of two hundred and fifty yards from the sea stretched in\r\na vast irregular arc abutting at each end against the cliff--the\r\ngraveyard of the Folk.\r\n\r\nThis awesome and peculiar place consisted of heaps of smooth black\r\nboulders piled upon the dead, each heap surmounted by a stone with\r\nsome crude emblem cut upon it, such as a circle, a square, a cluster\r\nof dots, even the rude figure of a bird, a fish, a tortoise, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nCertain of the figures he could make nothing of; but he concluded\r\nrightly they were totem-signs, and that they represented all which\r\nstill remained of the art of writing among those barbarous remnants of\r\nthe once dominant, powerful and highly cultured race of Americans.\r\n\r\nHe counted more than two hundred freshly built piles of stone, but\r\nwhether any of these contained more than one body of the Folk he\r\ncould, of course, not tell. Allowing, however, that only two hundred\r\nof the Folk and one hundred and sixty of the Lanskaarn had fallen, he\r\nreadily perceived that the battle had been, for intensity and high\r\npercentage of killing, sanguinary beyond all battles of his own time.\r\n\r\nUnder the walls, too, the vast numbers of boulders which had been\r\nthrown down, the debris of broken weapons, long and jaggedly barbed\r\niron spear-points and so on, indicated the military ardor and the\r\nboldness of the fighting men he now had to dominate and master.\r\n\r\nAnd in his soul he knew the problem of taming, civilizing, saving this\r\nrude and terrible people, was certainly the very greatest ever given\r\ninto the hands of one man and one woman, since time began!\r\n\r\nAlong the beach he found a goodly number of empty revolver-shells.\r\nThese he picked up, for possible reloading, in case he should be able\r\nat some later time to manufacture powder and some fulminating mixture.\r\n\r\nHe asked the patriarch to have search made for all such empty shells.\r\nThe Folk eagerly and intelligently cooperated.\r\n\r\nWith interest he watched the weird sight of scores of men with torches\r\nrolling the great stones about, seeking for the precious cartridges.\r\nFrom the beach they tossed the shells up to him as he walked along the\r\ntop of the fortifications so lately the scene of horrible combat; and\r\ndespite him his heart swelled with pride in his breast, to be already\r\ndirecting them in some concerted labor, even so slight as this.\r\n\r\nSave for some such interruption, the life of the community had now\r\nsettled back into its accustomed routine.\r\n\r\nWith diminished numbers, but indomitable energy, the Folk went on with\r\ntheir daily tasks. Stern concluded the great funeral ceremony, which\r\nmust have taken place over the fallen defenders, and the horrible\r\nrites attending the decapitation, boiling, and hanging up of the\r\ntrophies of war, the Lanskaarn skeletons, certainly must have formed a\r\nseries of barbaric pictures more ghastly than any drug-fiend's most\r\ndiabolical nightmare. He thanked God that the girl had been spared\r\nthese frightful scenes.\r\n\r\nHe could get the old man to tell him nothing concerning these terrific\r\nceremonies. But he discovered, some thirty yards to southward of the\r\ncircle of stone posts, a boiling geyserlike pool in the rock floor,\r\nwhence the thick steam continually arose, and which at times burst up\r\nin terrific seething.\r\n\r\nHere his keen eye detected traces of the recent rites. Here, he knew,\r\nthe enemies' corpses--and perhaps even some living captives--had been\r\nboiled.\r\n\r\nAnd as he stood on the sloping, slippery edge of the great natural\r\ncaldron, a pit perhaps forty feet in diameter--its margins all worn\r\nsmooth and greasy by innumerable feet--he shuddered in his soul.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" thought he. \"Imagine being flung in there!\"\r\n\r\nWhat was it, premonition or sheer repulsion, that caused him, brave as\r\nhe was, to turn away with a peculiar and intense horror?\r\n\r\nTry as he might, he could not banish from his mind the horrible\r\npicture of that boiling vat as it must have looked, crammed to the lip\r\nwith the tumbling, crowding bodies of the dead.\r\n\r\nHe seemed still to hear the groans of the wounded, the shrieks of the\r\nprisoners being dragged thither, being hurled into the spumy, scalding\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAnd in his heart he half despaired of ever bringing back to\r\ncivilization a people so wild and warlike, so cruel, so barbarous as\r\nthese abandoned People of the Abyss.\r\n\r\nCould he have guessed what lay in store for Beatrice and himself\r\nshould Kamrou, returning, find them still there, a keener and deadlier\r\nfear would have possessed his soul.\r\n\r\nBut of Kamrou he knew nothing yet. Even the chief's name he had not\r\nheard. And the patriarch, for reasons of his own, had not yet told the\r\ngirl a tenth part of the threatening danger.\r\n\r\nEven what he had told, he had forbidden her--for Allan's own sake--to\r\nlet him know.\r\n\r\nThus in a false and fancied sense of peace and calm security, Stern\r\nmade his observations, laid his plans, and day by day once more came\r\nback toward health and strength again.\r\n\r\nAnd day by day the unknown peril drew upon them both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nESCAPE?\r\n\r\n\r\nWho could, indeed, suspect aught of this threatening danger?\r\nOutwardly all now was peaceful. Each waking-time the fishers put forth\r\nin their long boats of metal strips covered with fish-skins. Every\r\nsleeping-time they returned laden with the fish that formed the\r\nprincipal staple of the community.\r\n\r\nThe weaving of seaweed fiber, the making of mats, blankets, nets and\r\nslings went on as probably for many centuries before.\r\n\r\nAt forges here and there, where gas-wells blazed, the smiths of the\r\nFolk shaped their iron implements or worked most skillfully in gold\r\nand copper; and the ringing of the hammers, through the dim-lit gloom\r\naround the strange blue fires, formed a chorus fit for Vulcan or the\r\ntempering of Siegfried's master-sword.\r\n\r\nStern took occasion to visit many of the huts. They were all similar.\r\nAs yet he could not talk freely with the Folk but he took keen\r\ninterest in examining their household arrangements, which were of the\r\nsimplest. Stone benches and tables, beds of weed, and coarse blankets,\r\nutensils of metal or bone--these completed the total.\r\n\r\nStern groaned inwardly at thought of all the arts he still must teach\r\nthem before they should once more even approximate the civilization\r\nwhence they had fallen since the great catastrophe.\r\n\r\nBehind the village rose a gigantic black cliff, always dripping and\r\nrunning with water from the condensation of the fogs. This water the\r\nFolk very sensibly and cleverly drained down into large tanks cut in\r\nthe rock floor. The tanks, always full, furnished their entire supply\r\nfor drinking and cooking. Flat, warm and tasteless though it was, it\r\nseemed reasonably pure. None of this water was ever used for bathing.\r\nWhat little bathing the Folk ever indulged in took place at certain\r\npoints along the shore, where the fine and jet-black sand made a good\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nAlong the base of the vast cliff, which, broken and jagged, rose\r\ngleaming in the light of the great flame till it gradually faded in\r\nthe luminous mist, they carried on their primitive cooking.\r\n\r\nOver cracks in the stone, whence gas escaped steadily and burned with\r\na blue flicker, hung copper pots fairly well fashioned, though of\r\nbizarre shapes. Here the communal cuisine went steadily forward,\r\ntended by the strange, white-haired, long-cloaked women; and odors of\r\nboiling and of frying, over hot iron plates, rose and mingled with the\r\nshifting, swirling vapors from the sea.\r\n\r\nBeatrice tried, a few times, to take some part in this work. She was\r\neager to teach the women better methods, but at last the patriarch\r\ntold her to let them alone, as she was only irritating them. Unlike\r\nthe men, who almost worshipped the revolvers, and would have handled\r\nthem, and even quickly learned to shoot, if Stern had allowed, the\r\nwomen clung sternly to their old ways.\r\n\r\nThe patriarch had a special cooking place made for Beatrice, and got\r\nher a lot of the clumsy utensils. Here she busied herself preparing\r\nfood for Allan and herself--and a strange sight that was, the American\r\ngirl, dressed in her long, brown robe, her thick hair full of gold\r\npins, cooking over natural gas in the Abyss, with heavy copper pans\r\nand kettles of incredible forms!\r\n\r\nAlmost at once, the old man abandoned the native cookery and grew\r\ndevoted to hers. Anything that told him of the other and better times,\r\nthe days about which he dreamed continually in his blindness, was very\r\ndear to him.\r\n\r\nThe Merucaans were, truly, barbarously dull about their ways of\r\npreparing food. Day after day they never varied. The menu was limited\r\nin the extreme. Stern felt astonished that a race could maintain\r\nitself in such fine condition and keep so splendidly energetic, so\r\nkeen and warlike, on such a miserable diet. The food must, he thought,\r\npossess nutritive qualities far beyond any expectation.\r\n\r\nFish was the basis of all--a score of strange and unnatural-looking\r\nvarieties, not one of which he had ever seen in surface waters. For\r\nthe most part, they were gray or white; two or three species showed\r\nsome rudiments of coloring. All were blind, with at most some faint\r\nvestigia of eye-structure, wholly degenerated and useless.\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of evolution,\" said the engineer, one day, to Beatrice, as\r\nthey stood on the black boulder-beach and watched the fishermen toss\r\ntheir weird freight out upon the slippery stones--\"these fish here\r\ngive a magnificent example of it. You see, where the use for an organ\r\nceases, the organ itself eventually perishes. But take these creatures\r\nand put them back into the surface-ocean--\"\r\n\r\n\"The eyes would develop again?\" she queried.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely! And so with everything! Take the Folk themselves, for\r\ninstance. Now that they've been living here a thousand or fifteen\r\nhundred years, away from the sunlight, all the protecting pigmentation\r\nthat used to shield the human race from the actinic sun rays has\r\ngradually faded out. So they've got white hair, colorless skins, and\r\npinkish eyes. Out in the world again, they'd gradually grow normal\r\nagain. How I wish some of my old-time opponents to the evolutionary\r\ntheory could stand here with me to-day in the Abyss! I bet a million I\r\ncould mighty soon upset their nonsense!\"\r\n\r\nSuch of the fish as were not eaten in their natural state were salted\r\ndown in vats hollowed in the rock, at the far end of the village.\r\nStill others were dried, strung by the gills on long cords of seaweed\r\nfiber, and hung in rows near the great flame. There were certain days\r\nfor this process.\r\n\r\nAt other times no fish were allowed anywhere near the fire. Why this\r\nwas, Stern could not discover. Even the patriarch would not tell him.\r\n\r\nBeside the fish, several seaweeds were cooked and eaten in the form of\r\nleaves, bulbs, and roots, which some of the Folk dived for or dragged\r\nfrom the bottom with iron grapples. All the weeds tasted alike to\r\nStern and Beatrice; but the old man assured them there were really\r\ngreat differences, and that certain of them were rare delicacies.\r\n\r\nA kind of huge, misshapen sea-turtle was the chief prize of all. Three\r\nwere taken during the strangers' first fortnight in the Abyss; but the\r\nfortunate boat-crews that brought them in devoured them, refusing to\r\nshare even a morsel with any other of the people.\r\n\r\nStern and the girl were warned against tasting any weed, fish, or\r\nmussel on their own initiative. The patriarch told them certain deadly\r\nspecies existed--species used only in preparing venoms in which to dip\r\nthe spear and lance-points of the fighting men.\r\n\r\nBeyond these foods the only others were the flesh and eggs of the\r\nhighly singular birds the strangers had seen on their first entry into\r\nthe village. These tasted rankly of fish, and were at first very\r\ndisagreeable. But gradually the newcomers were able to tolerate them\r\nwhen cooked by Beatrice in as near an approximation to modern methods\r\nas she could manage.\r\n\r\nThe birds made a peculiar feature of this weird, uncanny life. Long of\r\nleg, wattled and web-footed, with ungainly bodies, sparsely feathered,\r\nand bare necks, they were, Stern thought, absolutely the most hideous\r\nand unreal-appearing creatures he had ever seen. In size they somewhat\r\nresembled an albatross. The folk called them _kalamakee_. They were so\r\nfully domesticated as to make free with all the refuse of the village\r\nand even to waddle into the huts in croaking search of plunder; yet\r\nthey nested among the broken rocks along the cliff to northward of the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThere they built clumsy structures of weed for their eggs and their\r\nincredibly ugly young. Every day at a certain time they took their\r\nflight out into the fog, with hoarse and mournful cries, and stayed\r\nthe equivalent of some three hours.\r\n\r\nTheir number Stern could only estimate, but it must have mounted well\r\ntoward five or six thousand. One of the most singular sights the\r\nnewcomers had in the Abyss was the homecoming of the flight, the\r\nfeeding of the young--by discharging half-digested fish--and the\r\nsubsequent noisy powwow of the waddling multitude. All this, heard and\r\nseen by torch-light, produced a picture weirdly fascinating.\r\n\r\nFish, weeds, sea-fowl--these constituted the sum tote of food sources\r\nfor the Folk. There existed neither bread, flesh--meat, milk, fruit,\r\nsweets, or any of the abundant vegetables of the surface. Nor yet was\r\nthere any plant which might be dried and smoked, like tobacco, nor any\r\nwhence alcohol might be distilled. The folk had neither stimulants nor\r\nnarcotics.\r\n\r\nStern blessed fate for this. If any such had existed, he knew human\r\nnature well enough to feel certain that, there in the eternal gloom\r\nand fog, the race would soon have given itself over to excesses and\r\nhave miserably perished.\r\n\r\n\"To my mind,\" he said to Beatrice, one time, \"the survival of our race\r\nunder such conditions is one of the most marvelous things possibly to\r\nbe conceived.\" Out toward the black and mist-hidden sea that rolled\r\nforever in the gloom he gestured from the wall where they were\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\n\"Imagine!\" he continued. \"No sunlight--for centuries! Without that,\r\nnothing containing chlorophyl can grow; and science has always\r\nmaintained that human life must depend, at last analysis, on\r\nchlorophyl, on the green plants containing it. No grains, no soil, or\r\nagriculture, no mammals even! Why, the very Eskimo have to depend on\r\nmammals for their life!\r\n\r\n\"But these people here, and the Lanskaarn, and whatever other unknown\r\ntribes live in this vast Abyss, have to get their entire living from\r\nthis tepid sea. They don't even possess wood to work with! If this\r\ndoesn't prove the human race all but godlike in its skill and courage\r\nand adaptability, what does?\"\r\n\r\nShe stood a while in thought, plainly much troubled. It was evident\r\nher mind was far from following his analysis. At last she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Allan!\" she suddenly exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's still out there somewhere, isn't it? Out there, in those black,\r\nunsounded depths--the biplane?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why couldn't we raise it again, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course! You know I mean to try as soon as I have these people\r\nunder some control so I can get them to cooperate with me--get them to\r\nunderstand!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not till then? No escape till then? But, Allan, it may be too late!\"\r\nshe burst out with passionate eagerness.\r\n\r\nPuzzled, he turned and peered at her in the bluish gloom.\r\n\r\n\"Escape?\" he queried. \"Too late? Why, what do you mean? Escape from\r\nwhat? You mean that we should leave these people, here, before we've\r\neven begun to teach them? Before we've discovered some way out of the\r\nAbyss for them? Leave everything that means the regeneration of the\r\nhuman race, the world? Why--\"\r\n\r\nA touch upon his arm interrupted him.\r\n\r\nHe turned quickly to find the patriarch standing at his side. Silent\r\nand dim through the fog, he had come thither with sandaled feet, and\r\nnow stood with a strange, inscrutable smile on his long-bearded lips.\r\n\r\n\"What keeps my children here,\" asked he, \"when already it is long past\r\nthe sleeping-hour? Verily, this should not be! Come,\" he commanded.\r\n\"Come away! To-morrow will be time for speech.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, giving them no further opportunity to talk of this new problem,\r\nhe spoke of other matters, and so led them back to his hospitable hut\r\nof stone.\r\n\r\nBut for a long time Allan could not sleep. Weird thoughts and new\r\nsuspicions now aroused, he lay and pondered many things.\r\n\r\nWhat if, after all, this seeming friendliness and homage of the savage\r\nFolk were but a mask?\r\n\r\nA vision of the boiling geyser-pit rose to his memory. And the dreams\r\nhe dreamed that night were filled with strange, confused, disquieting\r\nimages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nHe woke to hear a drumming roar that seemed to fill the spaces\r\nof the Abyss with a wild tumult such as he had never known--a steady\r\nthunder, wonderful and wild.\r\n\r\nStarting up, he saw by the dim light that the patriarch was sitting\r\nthere upon the stone, thoughtful and calm, apparently giving no heed\r\nto this singular tumult. But Stern, not understanding, put a hasty\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"What's all this uproar, father? I never heard anything like that up\r\nin the surface-world!\"\r\n\r\n\"That? Only the rain, my son,\" the old man answered. \"Had you no rain\r\nthere? Verily, traditions tell of rain among the people of that day!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rain? Merciful Heavens!\" exclaimed the engineer. Two minutes later he\r\nwas at the fortifications, gazing out across the beach at the sea.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to describe accurately the picture that met his eyes.\r\nThe heaviest cloudburst that ever devastated a countryside was but a\r\ntrickle compared with this monstrous, terrifying deluge.\r\n\r\nSome five hundred miles of dense and saturated vapors, suddenly\r\ncondensing, were precipitating the water, not in drops but in great\r\nsolid masses, thundering, bellowing, crashing as they struck the sea,\r\nwhich, churned to a deep and raging froth, flung mighty waves even\r\nagainst the massive walls of the village itself.\r\n\r\nThe fog was gone now; but in its place the rushing walls of water\r\nblotted out the scene. Yet not a drop was falling in the village\r\nitself. Stern wondered for a moment. But, looking up, he understood.\r\n\r\nThe vast cliff was now dimly visible in the glare of the great flame,\r\nthe steady roar of which was drowned by the tumult of the rain.\r\n\r\nStern saw that the village was sheltered under a tremendous overhang\r\nof the black rock; he understood why the ancestors of the Folk, coming\r\nto these depths after incredible adventurings and long-forgotten\r\nstruggles, had settled here. Any exposed location would have been\r\nfatal; no hut could have withstood the torrent, nor could any man,\r\ncaught in it, have escaped drowning outright.\r\n\r\nAmazed and full of wonder at this terrific storm, so different from\r\nthose on the surface--for there was neither wind nor lightning, but\r\njust that steady, frightful sluicing down of solid tons of rain--Stern\r\nmade his way back to the patriarch's house.\r\n\r\nThere he met Beatrice, just awakened.\r\n\r\n\"No chance to raise the machine to-day!\" she called to him as he\r\nentered. \"He says this is apt to last for hours and hours!\" She nodded\r\ntoward the old man, much distressed.\r\n\r\n\"Patience!\" he murmured. \"Patience, friends--and peace!\"\r\n\r\nStern thought a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, at last, making himself heard only with difficulty,\r\n\"even so, we can spend the day in making ready.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, after the simple meal that served for breakfast, he sat down to\r\nthink out definitely some plan of campaign for the recovery of the\r\nlost Pauillac.\r\n\r\nThough Stern by no means understood the girl's anxiety to leave the\r\nAbyss, nor yet had any intention of trying to do so until he had begun\r\nthe education of the Folk and had perfected some means of trying to\r\ntransplant this group--and whatever other tribes he could find--to the\r\nsurface again, he realized the all-importance of getting the machine\r\ninto his possession once more.\r\n\r\nFor more than an hour he pondered the question, now asking a question\r\nof the patriarch--who seemed torn between desire to have the\r\nwonder-thing brought up, and fear lest he should lose the\r\nstrangers--now designing grapples, now formulating a definite line of\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nAt last, all things settled in his mind, he bade the old man get for\r\nhim ten strong ropes, such as the largest nets were made of. These\r\nropes which he had already seen coiled in huge masses along the wall\r\nat the northern end of the village, where they were twisted of the\r\ntough weed-fiber, averaged all of two hundred feet in length. When the\r\npatriarch had gone to see about having them brought to the hut, he\r\nhimself went across the plaza, with Beatrice, to the communal smithy.\r\n\r\nThere he appropriated a forge, hammers, and a quantity of iron bars,\r\nand energetically set to work fashioning a huge three-pronged hook.\r\n\r\nA couple of hours' hard labor at the anvil--labor which proved that he\r\nwas getting back his normal strength once more--completed the task.\r\nDeftly he heated, shaped and reshaped the iron, while vast\r\nBrocken-shadows danced and played along the titanic cliff behind him,\r\ncast by the wavering blue gas-flames of the forge. At length he found\r\nhimself in possession of a drag weighing about forty pounds and\r\nprovided with a stout ring at the top of the shank six inches in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he to Beatrice, as he surveyed the finished product, while\r\nall about them the inquisitive yet silent Folk watched them by the\r\nunsteady light, \"now I guess we're ready to get down to something\r\npractical. Just as soon as this infernal rain lets up a bit, we'll go\r\nangling for the biggest fish that ever came out of this sea!\"\r\n\r\nBut the storm was very far from being at an end. The patriarch told\r\nStern, when he brought the grapple to the hut--followed by a silent,\r\nall-observant crowd--that sometimes these torrential downpours lasted\r\nfrom three to ten sleep-times, with lulls between.\r\n\r\n\"And nobody can venture on the sea,\" he added, \"till we know--by\r\ncertain signs we have--that the great rain is verily at an end. To do\r\nthat would mean to court death; and we are wise, from very long\r\nexperience. So, my son, you must have patience in this as in all\r\nthings, and wait!\"\r\n\r\nPart of that afternoon of forced inactivity Stern spent in his\r\nfavorite habit of going about among the Folk, closely mingling with\r\nthem and watching all their industrial processes and social life, and\r\ntrying, as usual, to pick tip words and phrases of the very\r\nfar-degenerated speech that once had been English but was now a\r\ngrammarless and formless jumble of strange words.\r\n\r\nOnly a few of the most common words he found retained anything like\r\ntheir original forms--such as _w'hata_, water; _fohdu_, food;\r\n_yernuh_, iron; _vlaak_, black; _gomu_, come; _ghaa_, go; _fysha_,\r\nfish; and so on for about forty others.\r\n\r\nThousands upon thousands of terms, for which no longer any objects now\r\nexisted among the Folk, had been of course utterly forgotten; and some\r\nhundreds of new words, relative to new conditions, had been invented.\r\n\r\nThe entire construction was altered; the language now bore no more\r\nresemblance to English than English had borne to the primitive\r\nIndo-Germanic of the Aryan forefathers. Now that writing had been\r\nlost, nothing retarded changes; and Stern realized that here--were he\r\na trained philologist--lay a task incomparably interesting and\r\ndifficult, to learn this Merucaan speech and trace its development\r\nfrom his own tongue.\r\n\r\nBut Stern's skill was all in other lines. The most that he could do\r\nwas to make some rough vocabularies, learn a few common phrases, and\r\nhere or there try to teach a little English. A deeper study and\r\nteaching, he knew, would come later, when more important matters had\r\nbeen attended to.\r\n\r\nHis attempts to learn and to talk with these people--by pointing at\r\nobjects and listening to their names--were comparable to those,\r\nperhaps, of a prehistoric Goth turned loose in an American village of\r\nthe twentieth century. Only the patriarch had retained the\r\nmother-tongue, and that in an archaic, imperfect manner, so that even\r\nhis explanations often failed. Stern felt the baffling difficulties in\r\nhis way; but his determination only grew.\r\n\r\nThe rain steadily continued to drum down, now lessened, now again in\r\nterrific deluges of solid black water churned to white as they struck\r\nthe sea and flung the froth on high. The two Americans passed an hour\r\nthat afternoon in the old man's hut, drawing up a calendar on which to\r\ncheck as accurately as possible, the passage of time as reckoned in\r\nthe terms of life upon the surface.\r\n\r\nThey scratched this on a slab of slatelike rock, with a sharp iron\r\nawl; and, reckoning the present day as about October first, agreed\r\nthat every waking-time they would cross off one square.\r\n\r\n\"For,\" said the engineer, \"it's most important that we should keep\r\ntrack of the seasons up above. That may have much to do with our\r\nattempts to transplant this colony. It would never do to take a people\r\nlike this, accustomed to heat and vapor, and carry them out into even\r\nthe mild winter that now prevails in a present-day December. If we\r\ndon't get them to the surface before the last of this month, at\r\nlatest--\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to wait until another spring?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"Looks that way,\" he assented, putting a few final touches to the\r\ncalendar. \"So you see it's up to us to hurry--and certainly nothing\r\nmore inopportune than this devilish rain could possibly have happened!\r\nHaste, haste! We must make haste!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so!\" exclaimed Beatrice. \"Every day's precious, now. We--\"\r\n\r\n\"My children,\" hurriedly interrupted the patriarch, \"I never yet have\r\nshown you my book--my one and greatest treasure. The book!\r\n\r\n\"You have told me many things, of sun and moon and stars, which are\r\nmocked at as idle tales by my unbelieving people; of continents and\r\nseas, mountains, vast cities, great ships, strange engines moved by\r\nvapor and by lightning, tall houses; of words thrown along metal\r\nthreads or even through the air itself; of great nations and wars, of\r\na hundred wondrous matters that verily have passed away even from the\r\nremotest memories of us in the Abyss!\r\n\r\n\"But of our history I have told you little; nor have you seen the\r\nbook! Yet you must see it, for it alone remains to us of that other,\r\nbetter time. And though my folk mock at it as imposture and myth and\r\nfraud, you shall judge if it be true; you shall see what has kept the\r\nEnglish speech alive in me, kept memories of the upper world alive.\r\nOnly the book, the book!\"\r\n\r\nHis voice seemed strangely agitated. As he spoke he raised his hands\r\ntoward them, sitting on the stone bench in the hut, while outside the\r\nrain still thundered louder than the droning roar of the great flame.\r\nStern, his curiosity suddenly aroused, looked at the old man with keen\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\"The book?\" he queried. \"What book? What's the name of it? What date?\r\nWhat--who wrote it, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Patience, friends!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you've really got an English book here in this village? A--\"\r\n\r\n\"A book, verily, from the other days! But first, before I show you,\r\nlet me tell you the old tradition that was handed down to me by my\r\nfather and my father's fathers, down through centuries--I know not how\r\nmany.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the story of this Lost Folk in the Abyss?\"\r\n\r\n\"Verily! You have told me yours, of your awakening, of the ruined\r\nworld and all your struggles and your fall down into this cursed pit.\r\nListen now to mine!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE PATRIARCH'S TALE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning,\" he commanded, slowly and thoughtfully, \"our people\r\nwere as yours; they were the same. Our tradition tells that a great\r\nbreaking of the world took place very many centuries ago. Out of the\r\nearth a huge portion was split, and it became as the moon you tell of,\r\nonly dark. It circled about the earth--\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" cried Stern, and started to his feet. \"That dark patch in\r\nthe sky! That moving mystery we saw nights at the bungalow on the\r\nHudson!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--\" the girl exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"It's a new planetoid! Another satellite of the earth! It's the\r\nsplit-off part of the world!\"\r\n\r\n\"Another satellite?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course! Hang it, yes! See now? The great explosion that liberated\r\nthe poisonous gases and killed practically everybody in the world must\r\nhave gouged this new planet out of the flank of Mother Earth in the\r\nlatter part of 1920. The ejected portions, millions of millions of\r\ntons, hundreds of thousands of cubic miles of solid rock--and with\r\nthem the ruins of Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Omaha, and hundreds\r\nof smaller cities--are now all revolving in a fixed, regular orbit,\r\nsome few thousand miles or so from the surface!\r\n\r\n\"Think! Ours are the only living human eyes that have seen this new\r\nworld blotting out the stars! This explains everything--the singular\r\nchanges in the tides and in the direction of the magnetic pole,\r\ndecreased gravitation and all the other strange things we noticed, but\r\ncouldn't understand. By Gad! What a discovery!\"\r\n\r\nThe patriarch listened eagerly while Stern and the girl discussed the\r\nstrange phenomenon; but when their excitement had subsided and they\r\nwere ready again to hear him, he began anew:\r\n\r\n\"Verily, such was the first result of the great catastrophe. And, as\r\nyou know, millions died. But among the canyons of the Rocky\r\nMountains--so says the tradition; is it right? _Were_ there such\r\nmountains?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes! Go on!\"\r\n\r\n\"In those canyons a few handfuls of hardy people still survived. Some\r\nperished of famine and exposure; some ventured out into the lowlands\r\nand died of the gas that still hung heavy there. Some were destroyed\r\nin a great fire that the tradition says swept the earth after the\r\nexplosion. But a few still lived. At one time the number was only\r\neighteen men, twelve women and a few children, so the story goes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued the patriarch, his brow wrinkled in deep thought,\r\n\"then came the terrible, swift cold. The people, still keeping their\r\nEnglish tongue, now dead save for you two, and still with some tools\r\nand even a few books, retreated into caves and fissures in the\r\ncanyons. And so they came to the great descent.\"\r\n\r\n\"The what?\"\r\n\r\n\"The huge cleft which the story says once connected the upper world\r\nwith this Abyss. And--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it open _now_,\" cried Stern, leaning sharply forward.\r\n\r\n\"Alas, no; but you hurry me too much, good friend. You understand, for\r\na long time they lived the cave-life partly, and partly the upper\r\nlife. And they increased a great deal in the hundred years that\r\nfollowed the explosion. But they never could go into the plains, for\r\nstill the gas hung there, rising from a thousand wells--ten thousand,\r\nmayhap, all very deadly. And so they knew not if the rest of the world\r\nlived or died.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\" queried the engineer. \"Let's have it all in outline. What\r\nhappened?\"\r\n\r\n\"This, my son: that a still greater cold came upon the world, and the\r\nlife of the open became impossible. There were now ten or twelve\r\nthousand alive; but they were losing their skill, their knowledge,\r\neverything. Only a few men still kept the wisdom of reading or\r\nwriting, even. For life was a terrible fight. And they had to seek\r\nfood now in the cave-lakes; that was all remaining.\r\n\r\n\"After that, another fifty or a hundred years, came the second great\r\nexplosion. The ways were closed to the outer world. Nearly all died.\r\nWhat happened even the tradition does not tell. How many years the\r\nhandful of people wandered I do not know. Neither do I know how they\r\ncame here.\r\n\r\n\"The story says only eight or ten altogether reached this sea. It was\r\nmuch smaller then. The islands of the Lanskaarn, as we call them now,\r\nwere then joined to the land here. Great changes have taken place.\r\nVerily, all is different! Everything was lost--language and arts, and\r\neven the look of the Folk.\r\n\r\n\"We became as you see us. The tradition itself was forgotten save by a\r\nfew. Sometimes we increased, then came pestilences and famines,\r\noutbreaks of lava and hot mud and gases, and nearly all died. At one\r\ntime only seven remained--\"\r\n\r\n\"For all the world like the story of Pitcairn Island and the mutineers\r\nof the 'Bounty'!\" interrupted the engineer. \"Yes, yes--go on!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is little more to tell. The tradition says there was once a\r\nplace of records, where certain of the wisest men of our Folk placed\r\nall their lore to keep it; but even this place is lost. Only one\r\nfamily kept any knowledge of the English as a kind of inheritance and\r\nthe single book went with that family--\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Lanskaarn and the other peoples of the Abyss, where did\r\n_they_ come from?\" asked Stern eagerly.\r\n\r\nThe patriarch shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell?\" he answered. \"The tradition says nothing of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some other groups, probably,\" suggested Beatrice, \"that came in at\r\ndifferent times and through other ways.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly,\" Stern assented. \"Anything more to tell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more. We became as savages; we lost all thought of history or\r\nlearning. We only fought to live! All was forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"My grandfather taught the English to my father and he to me, and I\r\nhad no son. Nobody here would learn from me. Nobody cared for the\r\nbook. Even the tradition they laughed at, and they called my brain\r\nsoftened when I spoke of a place where in the air a light shone half\r\nthe time brighter even than the great flame! And in every way they\r\nmocked me!\r\n\r\n\"So I--I\"--the old man faltered, his voice tremulous, while tears\r\nglittered in his dim and sightless eyes--\"I ceased to speak of these\r\nthings. Then I grew blind and could not read the book. No longer could\r\nI refresh my mind with the English. So I said in my heart: 'It is\r\nfinished and will soon be wholly forgotten forever. This is the end.'\r\n\r\n\"Verily, I laid the book to rest as I soon must be laid to rest! Had\r\nyou not come from that better place, my thought would have been\r\ntrue--\"\r\n\r\n\"But it isn't, not by a jugful!\" exclaimed the engineer joyously, and\r\nstood up in the dim-lit little room. \"No, _sir!_ She and I, we're\r\ngoing to change the face of things considerably! How? Never mind just\r\nyet. But let's have a look at the old volume, father. Gad! That must\r\nbe some relic, eh? Imagine a book carried about for a thousand years\r\nand read by at least thirty generations of men! The book, father! The\r\nbook!\"\r\n\r\nAlready the patriarch had arisen and now he gestured at the heavy\r\nbench of stone.\r\n\r\n\"Can you move this, my son?\" asked he. \"The place of the book lies\r\nbeneath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Under there, eh? All right!\" And, needing no other invitation, he set\r\nhis strength against the massive block of gneiss.\r\n\r\nIt yielded at the second effort and, sliding ponderously to one side,\r\nrevealed a cavity in the stone floor some two feet long by about\r\neighteen inches in breadth.\r\n\r\nOver this the old man stooped.\r\n\r\n\"Help me, son,\" bade he. \"Once I could lift it with ease, but now the\r\nweight passes my strength.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? The weight of a book? But--where is it? In this packet, here?\"\r\n\r\nHe touched a large and close-wrapped bundle lying in the little crypt,\r\ndimly seen by the flicker of the oily wick.\r\n\r\n\"Yea. Raise it out that I may show you!\" answered the patriarch. His\r\nhands trembled with eagerness; in his blind eyes a sudden fever seemed\r\nto burn. For here was his dearest, his most sacred treasure, all that\r\nremained to him of the long-worshipped outer world--the world of the\r\nvague past and of his distant ancestors--the world that Stern and\r\nBeatrice had really known and seen, yet which to him was only \"all a\r\nwonder and a wild desire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lay the book upon the bench,\" he ordered. \"I will unwrap it!\"\r\n\r\nComplex the knots were, but his warped and palsied fingers deftly\r\nundid them as though long familiar with each turn and twist. Then off\r\ncame many a layer of the rough brown seaweed fabric and afterward\r\ncertain coverings of tough shark-skin neatly sewn.\r\n\r\n\"The book!\" cried the patriarch. \"Now behold it!\"\r\n\r\n\"_That?_\" exclaimed Beatrice. \"I never saw a book of that shape!\"\r\n\r\n\"Each page is separately preserved, wherefore it is so very thick,\"\r\nexplained the old man. \"See here?\"\r\n\r\nHe turned the leaves reverently. Stern, peering closely by the dim\r\nlight, saw that they were loosely hung together by loops of heavy gold\r\nwire. Each page was held between two large plates of mica, and these\r\nplates were securely sealed around the edges by some black substance\r\nlike varnish or bitumen.\r\n\r\n\"Only thus,\" explained the patriarch, \"could we hope to save this\r\nprecious thing. It was done many hundreds of years ago, and even then\r\nthe book was almost lost by age and use.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say so!\" ejaculated Stern. Even sealed in its air-tight\r\ncovering, he saw that every leaf was yellow, broken, rotten, till the\r\nmerest breath would have disintegrated it to powder. A sense of the\r\ninfinitudes of time bridged by this volume overwhelmed him; he drew a\r\ndeep breath, reached out his hand and touched the wondrous relic of\r\nthe world that was.\r\n\r\n\"Long ago,\" continued the old man, \"when the book began to crumble,\r\none of my ancestors copied it on gold plates, word by word, letter by\r\nletter, every point and line. And our family used only that book of\r\ngold and put away the other. But in my grandfather's time the\r\nLanskaarn raided our village and the gold plates went for loot to make\r\nthem trinkets, so they were lost.\r\n\r\n\"My father meant to begin the task again, but was killed in a raid. I,\r\ntoo, in my fighting youth, had plans for the work; but blindness\r\nstruck me before I could find peace to labor in. So now all that\r\nremains of the mother tongue here is my own knowledge and these\r\ntattered scraps. And, if you save us not, soon all, all will be lost\r\nforever!\"\r\n\r\nMuch moved, the engineer made no reply, yet thoughts came crowding to\r\nhis brain. Here visibly before him he beheld the final link that tied\r\nthese lost Folk to the other time, the last and breaking thread. What\r\nhistory could this book have told? What vast catastrophes, famines,\r\npestilences, wars, horrors had it passed through? In what unwritten\r\ncataclysms, in what anguish and despair and long degeneration had the\r\nhuman mind still clung to it and cherished it?\r\n\r\nNo one could tell; yet Stern felt the essence of its unknown story. An\r\ninfinite pathos haloed the ancient volume. And reverently he touched\r\nits pages once again; he bent and by the guttering light tried to make\r\nout a few words here or there upon the crackled, all but perished\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nHe came upon a crude old woodcut, vague and dim; then a line of text\r\ncaught his eye.\r\n\r\n\"By Gad! 'Pilgrim's Progress'!\" he exclaimed. \"Look,\r\nBeatrice--'Pilgrim's Progress,' of all books! No wonder he says\r\n'Verily' and talks archaic stuff and doesn't catch more than half we\r\nsay. Well, I'll be--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this then not the English of your time?\" asked the patriarch.\r\n\r\n\"Hardly! It was centuries old at the epoch of the catastrophe. Say,\r\nfather, the quicker you forget this and take a few lessons in the\r\nup-to-date language of the real world that perished, the better! I see\r\nnow why you don't get on to the idea of steamships and railroads,\r\ntelephones and wireless and all the rest of it. God! but you've got a\r\nlot to learn!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man closed up the precious volume and once more began wrapping\r\nit in its many coverings.\r\n\r\n\"Not for me, all this, I fear,\" he answered with deep melancholy. \"It\r\nis too late, too late--I cannot understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, you can, and will!\" the engineer assured him. \"Buck up,\r\nfather! Once I get my biplane to humming again you'll learn a few\r\nthings, never fear!\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped to the door of the hut and peered out.\r\n\r\n\"Rain's letting up a bit,\" he announced. \"How about it? Do the signs\r\nsay it's ready to quit for keeps? If so--all aboard for the dredging\r\nexpedition!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF KAMROU\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm, in fact, was now almost at an end, and when the\r\nengineer awoke next morning he found the rain had wholly ceased.\r\nThough the sea was still giving forth white vapors, yet these had not\r\nyet reached their usual density. From the fortifications he could see,\r\nby the reflected lights of the village and of the great flame, a\r\nconsiderable distance out across the dim, mysterious sea. He knew the\r\ntime was come to try for the recovery of the machine, if ever.\r\n\r\n\"If I don't make a go of it to-day,\" said he, \"I might as well quit\r\nfor good. There'll never be a better opportunity. And if it's left\r\ndown there very much longer, Heaven only knows what kind of shape\r\nit'll be in. I make good to-day or it's all off.\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice eagerly seconded his plans. The old man, too, was impatient\r\nas a child to learn more of this wonder of the upper world. And,\r\ntranslating to the Folk the directions that Stern gave him, he soon\r\nhad a great throng on the beach, where lay not only the Folk's canoes,\r\nbut also many left by the slaughtered and dispersed Lanskaarn.\r\n\r\nTwo hours after the crude meal that must be called breakfast for want\r\nof a better name, the expedition was ready to start.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five of the largest boats, some holding twelve men, set out, to\r\nthe accompaniment of shouting and singing much like that when the\r\ncaptives had been brought in. Stern, Beatrice and the patriarch all\r\nsat in one canoe with eight paddlers. In the bottom lay Stern's heavy\r\ngrapple with the ten long ropes, now twisted into a single cable,\r\nsecurely knotted to its ring.\r\n\r\nTo Stern it seemed impossible that any means existed for locating,\r\neven approximately, the spot where the machine had fallen. As the\r\nshore faded away and the village lights disappeared in the gloom and\r\nmist, all landmarks vanished. Everywhere about them the dim, oily sea\r\nstretched black and gloomy, with here and there the torches of the\r\nlittle fleet casting strange blue-green lights that wavered like\r\nghostly will-o'-the-wisps over the water.\r\n\r\nThe boatman's song wailed high, sank low, trembled and ceased; and for\r\na while came silence, save for the dipping of the paddles, the purling\r\nof the waters at the bow of the canoe. The engineer, despite his\r\nhard-headed practicality, shuddered a little and drew his mantle\r\ncloser round him.\r\n\r\nBeatrice, too, felt the eerie mystery of the scene. Stern put an arm\r\nabout her; she slid her hand into his, and thus in silence they sat\r\nthinking while the boats drew on and on.\r\n\r\n\"They really know where they're going, father?\" the engineer asked at\r\nlength. \"It all looks alike to me. How can they tell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Verily, I cannot explain that to you,\" the old man made answer. \"We\r\nknow, that is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\"\r\n\r\n\"Had I been always blind you could not expound sight to me. A deaf man\r\ncannot understand sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you've developed some new sense, some knowledge of direction\r\nand location that _we_ haven't got?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yea, it must be so. In all these many centuries among the dark mists\r\nwe have to know. And this gloom, this night, are the same to us as you\r\nhave told me a lake on the surface would be to you in the brightness\r\nof that sun which none of use have ever yet beheld.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that so? Well, hanged if I get it! However, no matter about that\r\njust so they locate the place. Can they find the exact spot, father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not so. But they will come near to it, my son. Only have\r\npatience; you shall see!\"\r\n\r\nStern and the girl relapsed into silence again, and for perhaps a\r\nquarter-hour the boats moved steadily forward through the vapors in a\r\nkind of crescent, the tips of which were hidden by the mist.\r\n\r\nThen all at once a sharp cry rang from a boat off to the right, a cry\r\ntaken up and echoed all along the line. The paddles ceased to ply; the\r\ncanoes now drifted idly forward, their wakes trailing out behind in\r\nlong \"slicks\" of greasy blackness flecked with sparkles from the\r\nreflected light of all those many torches.\r\n\r\nAnother word of command; the boatmen slowed their craft.\r\n\r\n\"Drop the iron here, son, and drag the bottom,\" said the patriarch.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" answered Stern, thrilled with excitement and wonder.\r\n\r\nHe pitched the dredge into the jetty sea. It sank silently as he payed\r\nout the cable. At a depth he estimated--from the amount of cable still\r\nleft in the boat--as about thirty fathoms, it struck bottom.\r\n\r\nHe let out another five fathoms.\r\n\r\n\"All right, father!\" he exclaimed sharply. \"Tell our boatmen to give\r\nway!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man translated the order: \"Ghaa vrouaad, m'yaun!\" (Go\r\nforward, men.) The paddles dipped again and Stern's canoe moved\r\nsilently over the inky surface.\r\n\r\nEvery sense alert, the engineer at the gunwale held the cable. For a\r\nfew seconds he felt nothing as the slack was taken up; then he\r\nperceived a tug and knew the grapple was dragging.\r\n\r\nNow intense silence reigned, broken only by the sputter of the smoking\r\ntorches. The canoes, spaced over the foggy sea, seemed floating in a\r\nvoid of nothingness; each reflected light quivered and danced with\r\nweird and tremulous patterns.\r\n\r\nStern played the cable as though it were a fish-line. All his senses\r\ncentered on interpreting the message it conveyed. Now he felt that it\r\nwas dragging over sand; now came rocks--and once it caught, held, then\r\njerked free. His heart leaped wildly. Oh, had it only been the\r\naeroplane!\r\n\r\nThe tension grew. Out, far out from the drifting line of boats the\r\ncanoe went forward; it turned at a word from the patriarch and dragged\r\nalong the front of the line. It criss-crossed on its path; Stern had\r\nto admire the skill and thoroughness with which the boatmen covered\r\nthe area where their mysterious sixth sense of location told them the\r\nmachine must lie.\r\n\r\nAll at once a tug, different from all others, yielding, yet firm, set\r\nhis pulses hammering again.\r\n\r\n\"Got it!\" he shouted, for he knew the truth. \"Hold fast, there--_she's\r\nhooked!_\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got it, Allan? Really got it?\" cried the girl, starting up.\r\n\"Oh--\"\r\n\r\n\"Feel this!\" he answered. \"Grab hold and pull!\"\r\n\r\nShe obeyed, trembling with eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"It's caught through one of the ailerons, or some yielding part, I\r\nthink,\" he said. \"Here, help me hold it tight, now; we mustn't let the\r\nhook slip out again!\" To the patriarch he added: \"Tell 'em to back up,\r\nthere--easy--easy!\"\r\n\r\nThe canoe backed, while Stern took up the slack again. When the pull\r\nfrom below was vertical he ordered the boat stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Now get nine other boats close in here,\" commanded he.\r\n\r\nThe old man gave the order. And presently nine canoes stood in near at\r\nhand, while all the rest lay irregularly grouped about them.\r\n\r\nNow Stern's plan of the tenfold cable developed itself. Already he was\r\nuntwisting the thick rope. One by one he passed the separate cords to\r\nmen in the other boats. And in a few minutes he and nine other men\r\nheld the ropes, which, all attached to the big iron ring below, spread\r\nupward like the ribs of an inverted umbrella.\r\n\r\nThe engineer's scheme was working to perfection. Well he had realized\r\nthat no one boat could have sufficed to lift the great weight of the\r\nmachine. Even the largest canoe would have been capsized and sunk long\r\nbefore a single portion of the Pauillac and its engine had been so\r\nmuch as stirred from the sandy bottom.\r\n\r\nBut with the buoyant power of ten canoes and twenty or thirty men all\r\napplied simultaneously, Stern figured he had a reasonable chance of\r\nraising the sunken aeroplane. The fact that it was submerged, together\r\nwith the diminished gravitation of the Abyss, also worked in his\r\nfavor. And as he saw the Folk-men grip the cords with muscular hands,\r\nawaiting his command, he thrilled with pride and with the sense of\r\nreal achievement.\r\n\r\n\"Come, now, boys!\" he cried. \"Pull! Heave-ho, there! Altogether, lift\r\nher! _Pull!_\"\r\n\r\nHe strained at the rope which he and two others held; the rest--each\r\nrope now held by three or four men--bent their back to the labor. As\r\nthe ropes drew tense, the canoes crowded and jostled together. Those\r\nmen who were not at the ropes, worked with the paddles to keep the\r\nboats apart, so that the ropes should not foul or bind. And in an\r\nirregular ring, all round the active canoes, the others drew. Lighted\r\nby so many torches, the misty waters glittered as broken waves, thrown\r\nout by the agitation of the canoes, radiated in all directions.\r\n\r\n\"Pull, boys, pull!\" shouted the engineer again. \"Up she comes! Now,\r\nall together!\"\r\n\r\nCame a jerk, a long and dragging resistance, then a terrific straining\r\non the many cords. The score and a half of men breathed hard; on their\r\nnaked arms the veins and muscles swelled; the torchlight gleamed blue\r\non their sweating faces and bodies.\r\n\r\nAnd spontaneously, as at all times of great endeavor among the Folk, a\r\nwailing song arose; it echoed through the gloom; it grew, taken up by\r\nthe outlying boats; and in the eternal dark of the Abyss it rose,\r\nuncanny, soul-shaking, weird beyond all telling.\r\n\r\nStern felt the shuddering chills chase each other up and down his\r\nspine, playing a nervous accompaniment to their chant.\r\n\r\n\"Gad!\" he muttered, shivering, \"what a situation for a hard-headed,\r\npractical man like me! It's more like a scene from some weird\r\npipe-dream magazine story of the remote past than solid reality!\"\r\n\r\nAgain the Folk strained at the ropes, Stern with them; and now the\r\ngreat weight below was surely rising, inch by inch, up, up, toward the\r\nblack and gleaming surface of the abysmal sea.\r\n\r\nStern's heart was pounding wildly. If only--incredible as it\r\nseemed--the Pauillac really were there at the end of the converging\r\nropes; and if it were still in condition to be repaired again! If only\r\nthe hook and the hard-taxed ropes held!\r\n\r\n\"Up, boys! Heave 'er!\" he shouted, pulling till his muscles hardened\r\nlike steel, and the canoe--balanced, though it was by five oarsmen and\r\nthe patriarch all at the other gunwale--tipped crazily. \"Pull!\r\n_Pull!_\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice sprang to the rope. Unable to restrain herself, she, too,\r\nlaid hold on the taut, dripping cord; and her white hands, firm,\r\nmuscular, shapely, gripped with a strength one could never have\r\nguessed lay in them.\r\n\r\nAnd now the ropes were sliding up out of the water, faster, ever\r\nfaster; and higher rose the song of all those laboring Folk and all\r\nwho watched from the outlying ring of boats.\r\n\r\n\"Up with it, men! _Up!_\" panted the engineer.\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke the waters beneath them began to boil and bubble\r\nstrangely, as though with the rising of a monstrous fish; and all at\r\nonce, with a heave, a sloshing splatter, a huge, weed-covered,\r\nwinglike object, sluicing brine, wallowed sharply out into the\r\ntorchlight.\r\n\r\nA great triumphal howl rose from the waiting Folk--a howl that drowned\r\nStern's cheer and that of Beatrice, and for a moment all was\r\nconfusion. The wing rose, fell, slid back; into the water and again\r\ndipped upward. The canoes canted; some took water; all were thrown\r\nagainst each other in the central group; and cries, shouts, orders and\r\na wild fencing off with paddles followed.\r\n\r\nStern yelled in vain orders that the old man could not even hear to\r\ntranslate; orders which would not, even though heard, have been\r\nobeyed. But after a moment or two comparative order was restored, and\r\nthe engineer, veins standing out on his temples, eyes ablaze,\r\nbellowed:\r\n\r\n\"Hold fast, you! No more, nor more--don't pull up any more, damn you!\r\nHey, stop that--you'll rip the hook clean out and lose it again!\r\n\r\n\"You, father--here--tell 'em to let it down a little, now--about six\r\nfeet, so. Easy--does it--_easy!_\"\r\n\r\nNow the Pauillac, sodden with water, hanging thickly with the\r\nluxuriant weed clusters which even in a fortnight had grown in that\r\nwarm sea, was suspended at the end of the ten cords about six or eight\r\nfeet below the keels of the canoes.\r\n\r\n\"Tell 'em to let it stay that way now,\" continued the engineer. \"Tell\r\n'em all to hold fast, those that have the ropes. The others paddle for\r\nthe shore as fast as they can--and damn the man that loafs _now!_\"\r\n\r\nThe patriarch conveyed the essence of these instructions to the\r\noarsmen, and now, convoyed by the outlying boats, the ten canoes moved\r\nvery slowly toward the village.\r\n\r\nRetarded by the vast, birdlike bulk that trailed below, they seemed\r\nhardly to make any progress at all. Stern ordered the free boats to\r\nhitch on and help by towing. Lines were passed, and after a while all\r\ntwenty-five canoes, driven by the power of two hundred and fifty pairs\r\nof sinewy arms, were dragging the Pauillac shoreward.\r\n\r\nStern's excitement--now that the machine was really almost in his\r\ngrasp again--far from diminishing, was every minute growing keener.\r\n\r\nThe delay until he could examine it and see its condition and its\r\nchances of repair, seemed interminable. Continually he urged the\r\npatriarch--himself profoundly moved--to force the rowers to still\r\ngreater exertion. At a paddle he labored, throwing every ounce of\r\nstrength into the toil. Each moment seemed an hour.\r\n\r\n\"Gad! If it's only possible to make it fly again!\" thought he.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour passed, and now at length the dim and clustered lights of\r\nthe village began to show vaguely through the mist.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, boys; now for it!\" shouted Stern. \"Land her for me and I'll\r\nshow you wonders you never even dreamed of!\"\r\n\r\nThey drew near the shore. Already Stern was formulating his plans for\r\nlanding the machine without injuring it, when out from the beach a\r\nlong and swift canoe put rapidly, driven by twenty men.\r\n\r\nAt sight of it the rowing in Stern's boats weakened, then stopped.\r\nConfused cries arose, altercations and strange shouts; then a hush of\r\nexpectancy, of fear, seemed to possess the boat crews.\r\n\r\nAnd ever nearer, larger, drew the long canoe, a two-pronged, blazing\r\ncresset at its bows.\r\n\r\nAcross the waters drifted a word.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, you! Row!\" cried Stern. \"Land the machine, I tell you! Say,\r\nfather, what's the matter _now?_ What are my men on strike for all of\r\na sudden? Why don't they finish the job?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man, perplexed, listened intently.\r\n\r\nBetween the group of canoes and the shore the single boat had stopped.\r\nA man was standing upright in it. Now came a clear hail, and now two\r\nor three sentences, peremptory, angry, harsh.\r\n\r\nAt sound of them consternation seized certain of the men. A number\r\ndropped the ropes, while others reached for the slings and spears that\r\nalways lay in the bottoms of the canoes.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil _now?_\" shouted Stern. \"You all gone crazy, or what?\"\r\n\r\nHe turned appealingly to the old man.\r\n\r\n\"For Heaven's sake, what's up?\" he cried. \"Tell me, can't you, before\r\nthe idiots drop my machine and ruin the whole thing? What--\"\r\n\r\n\"Misfortune, O my son!\" cried the patriarch in a strange, trembling\r\nvoice. \"The worst that could befall! In our absence _he_ has come\r\nback--_he_, Kamrou! And under pain of death he bids all men abandon\r\nevery task and haste to homage. _Kamrou the Terrible is here!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nFACE TO FACE WITH DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment Stern stared, speechless with amazement, at the\r\nold man, as though to determine whether or not he had gone mad. But\r\nthe commotion, the mingled fear and anger of the boat crews convinced\r\nhim the danger, though unknown, was very real.\r\n\r\nAnd, flaring into sudden rage at this untimely interruption just in\r\nthe very moment of success, he jerked his pistol from its holster, and\r\nstood up in the boat.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have no butting in here!\" he cried in a loud, harsh voice. \"Who\r\nthe devil is Kamrou, I'd like to know? Go on, _on, to shore!_\"\r\n\r\n\"My son--\"\r\n\r\n\"You order these men to grab those ropes again and go ashore or I warn\r\nyou there's going to be a whole big heap of trouble!\"\r\n\r\nOver the waters drifted another hail, and the strange long boat, under\r\nthe urge of vigorous arms, now began to move toward Stern's fleet. At\r\nthe same time, mingled cries arose on shore. Stern could see lights\r\nmoving back and forth; some confusion was under way there, though\r\nwhat, he could not imagine.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he cried, \"are you going to order these men to go forward? Or\r\nshall I--with _this?_\"\r\n\r\nAnd menacingly he raised the grim and ugly gun.\r\n\r\n\"Oh my son!\" exclaimed the patriarch, his lips twitching, his hands\r\noutstretched--while in the boats a babel of conflicting voices\r\nrose--\"O my son, if I have sinned in keeping this from you, now let me\r\ndie! I hid it from your knowledge, verily, to save my people--to keep\r\nyou with us till this thing should be accomplished! My reckoning was\r\nthat Kamrou and his men would stay beyond the Great Vortex, at their\r\nlabor, until after--\"\r\n\r\n\"_Kamrou?_\" shouted Stern again. \"What the deuce do I care about him?\r\nWho _is_ he, anyhow? A Lanskaarn, or--\"\r\n\r\nThe girl seized Allan's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, listen, listen!\" she implored. \"I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know about this? And never told me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Allan, he said our work could all be done before they--\"\r\n\r\n\"So you _did_ know, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said I must not tell you. Otherwise--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hang that! See here, Beatrice, what's the matter, anyhow? These\r\npeople have all gone crazy, just in a second, the old man and all! If\r\nyou know anything about it, for God's sake tell me! I can't stand much\r\nmore!\r\n\r\n\"I've got to get this machine to land before they go entirely nutty\r\nand drop it, and we lose all our work for nothing. What's up? Who's\r\nthis Kamrou they're talking about? For Heaven's sake, tell me!\"\r\n\r\n\"He's their chief. Allan--their chief! He's been gone a long time, he\r\nand his men. And--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do we care for _him?_ We're running this village now,\r\naren't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen. The old man says--\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a hard nut, eh? And won't stand for us--is that it?\" He turned\r\nto the patriarch. \"This Kamrou you're talking about doesn't want us,\r\nor our new ideas, or anything? Well, see here. There's no use beating\r\naround the bush, now. _This thing's going through, this plan of ours!_\r\nAnd if Kamrou or anybody else gets in the way of it--_good-by for\r\nhim!_\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean war?\"\r\n\r\n\"_War!_ And I know who'll win, at that! And now, father, you get these\r\nmen here to work again, or there'll be some sudden deaths round here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hearken, O my son! Already the feast of welcome to Kamrou is\r\nbeginning, around the flame. See now, the boat of his messenger is\r\nclose at hand, bidding all those in this party to hasten in, for\r\nhomage. Kamrou will not endure divided power. Trust me now and I can\r\nsave you yet. For the present, yield to him, or seem to, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"_Yield nothing!_\" fairly roared the engineer, angrier than he had\r\never been in his whole life. \"This is my affair now! Nobody else butts\r\nin on it at all! To shore with these boats, you hear? or I begin\r\nshooting again! And if I do--\"\r\n\r\n\"Allan!\" cried the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Not a word! Only get your gun ready, that's all. We've got to handle\r\nthis situation sharp, or it's all off! Come, father,\" he delivered his\r\nultimatum to the patriarch; \"come, order them ashore!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man, anguished and tremulous, spoke a few words. Answers\r\narose, here, there. He called something to the standing figure in the\r\ndespatch-boat, which slackened stopped, turned and headed for the\r\ndistant beach.\r\n\r\nWith some confusion the oarsmen of the fleet took up their task again.\r\nAnd now, in a grim silence, more disconcerting even than the previous\r\nuproar, the boats made way toward land.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later--minutes during which the two Americans kept their\r\nrevolvers ready for instant action--the aeroplane began to drag on the\r\nbottom. Despite the crowd now gathered on the beach, very near at hand\r\nand ominously silent, Stern would not let the machine lie even here,\r\nin shallow water, where it could easily have been recovered at any\r\ntime. Like a bulldog with its jaws set on an object, he clung to his\r\noriginal plan of landing the Pauillac at once.\r\n\r\nAnd, standing up in the boat with his pistol leveled, he commanded\r\nthem, through the mediumship of the patriarch, to shorten the ropes\r\nand paddle in still closer. When the beach was only a few rods distant\r\nhe gave orders that all should land, carrying the ropes with them. He\r\nhimself was one of the first to wade ashore, with Beatrice.\r\n\r\nIgnoring the silent, expectant crowd and the tall figure of Kamrou's\r\nmessenger--who now stood, arms crossed, amazed, indignant, almost at\r\nthe water's edge--he gave quick commands:\r\n\r\n\"Now, clear these boats away on both sides! Make a free space,\r\nhere--wider--so, that's right. Now, all you men get hold of the\r\nropes--all of you, here, take hold, you! Ready, now? Give way, then!\r\nOut she comes! Out with her!\"\r\n\r\nThe patriarch, standing in fear and keen anxiety beside him,\r\ntransmitted the orders. Truly the old man's plight was hard, torn as\r\nhe was between loyalty to the newcomers and terror of the implacable\r\nKamrou. But Stern had no time to think of aught but the machine and\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\nFor now already the great ungainly wings of the machine were wallowing\r\nup, up, out of the jetty waters; and now the body, now the engine\r\nshowed, weed-festooned, smeared with mud and slime, a strange and\r\nawesome apparition in that blue and ghastly torch-flare, as the\r\ntoiling men hauled it slowly, foot by foot, up the long slope of the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nDense silence held the waiting throng; silence and awe, in face of\r\nthis incomprehensible, tremendous thing.\r\n\r\nEven the messenger spoke not a word. He had lost somewhat of his\r\nassurance, his pride and overbearing haughtiness. Perhaps he had\r\nalready heard some tales of these interlopers' terrible weapons.\r\n\r\nStern saw the man's eyes follow the revolver, as he gestured with it;\r\nthe high-lights gleaming along the barrel seemed to fascinate the tall\r\nbarbarian. But still he drew no step backward. Still in silence, with\r\ncrossed arms, he waited, watched and took counsel only with himself.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God, it's out at last!\" exclaimed the engineer, and heaved a\r\nsigh of genuine, heartfelt relief. \"See, Beatrice, there s our old\r\nmachine again--and except for that broken rudder, this wing, here,\r\nbent, and the rent where the grapple tore the leather covering of the\r\nstarboard plane I can't see that it's taken any damage. Provided the\r\nengine's intact, the rest will be easy. Plenty of chance for\r\nmetalwork, here, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Going to take it right up to the village, now?\" queried she,\r\nanxiously glancing at the crowd of white and silent faces, all eagerly\r\nstaring--staring like so many wraiths in a strange dream.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"That depends,\" he answered. He seemed already to have forgotten\r\nKamrou and the threatening peril in the village, near the great flame.\r\nEven the sound of distant chanting and the thudding of dull drums\r\nstirred him not. Fascinated, he was walking all round the great\r\nmechanical bird, which now lay wounded, weed-covered, sodden and\r\ndripping, yet eloquent of infinite possibilities, there on that black,\r\nunearthly beach.\r\n\r\nAll at once he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Up to the village with it!\" he commanded, waving his pistol-hand\r\ntoward the causeway and the fortified gates. \"I can't risk leaving it\r\nhere. Come, father, speak to them! It's got to go into the village\r\nright now!\"\r\n\r\nThen Kamrou's messenger, grasping the sense if not the words of the\r\ncommand, strode forward--a tall, lithe figure of a man, well-knit and\r\nhard of face. Under the torchlight the dilated pupils of his pinkish\r\neyes seemed to shine as phosphorescent as a cat's.\r\n\r\nCrying out something unintelligible to Stern, he blocked the way.\r\nStern heard the name \"Kamrou! Kamrou!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you want now?\" shouted the engineer, a huge and sudden\r\nanger seizing him. Already super-excited by the labors of the day and\r\nby the nervous strain of having recovered the sunken biplane, all this\r\ntalk of Kamrou, all this persistent opposition just at the most\r\ninauspicious moment worked powerfully upon his irritated nerves.\r\n\r\nCool reason would have dictated diplomacy, parley, and, if possible,\r\ntruce. But Stern could not believe the Folk, for so long apparently\r\nloyal to him and dominated by his influence, could work against their\r\nvital interest and his own by deserting him now.\r\n\r\nAnd, all his saner judgment failing him, heeding nothing of the\r\npatriarch's entreaties or of the girl's remonstrance as she caught his\r\narm and tried to hold him back, he faced this cooly insolent\r\nbarbarian.\r\n\r\n\"You, damn you, what _d'you_ want?\" he cried again, his finger itching\r\non the trigger of the automatic. \"Think I'm going to quit for you, or\r\nKamrou, or anybody? Quit, _now?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Think a civilized white man, sweating his heart out to save your\r\npeople here, is going to knuckle under to any savage that happens to\r\nblow in and try to boss this job? If so, you've got another guess\r\ncoming! Stand back, you, or you'll get cold lead in just one minute!\"\r\n\r\nQuick words passed from the old man to the messenger and back again.\r\nThe patriarch cried again to him, and for a moment Stern saw the\r\nbarbarian's eyes flicker uneasily toward the revolver. But the calm\r\nand cruel face never changed, nor did the savage take one step\r\nbackward.\r\n\r\n\"All right, then!\" shouted Stern, \"seeing red\" in his overpowering\r\nrage. \"You want it--you'll get it--take it, so!\"\r\n\r\nUp he jerked the automatic, fair at the big barbarian's heart--a\r\nsplendid target by the torch-light, not ten feet distant; a sure shot.\r\n\r\nBut before he could pull trigger the strange two-pronged torch was\r\ntossed on high by somebody behind the messenger, and through the dull\r\nand foggy gloom a wild, fierce, penetrant cry wailed piercingly.\r\n\r\nCame a shooting, numbing pain in Stern's right elbow. The arm dropped,\r\nhelpless. The boulder which, flung with accurate aim, had destroyed\r\nhis aim, rolled at his feet. The pistol clattered over the wet,\r\nshining stones.\r\n\r\nStern, cursing madly, leaped and snatched for it with the other hand.\r\n\r\nBefore he could even reach it a swift foot tripped him powerfully.\r\nHeadlong he fell. And in a second one of the very ropes that had been\r\nused to drag the Pauillac from the depths was lashed about his wrists,\r\nhis ankles, his struggling, fighting body.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! Shoot! Kill!\" he shouted. \"Help here! _Help!_ The\r\nmachine--they'll wreck it! Everything--lost! _Help!_\"\r\n\r\nHis speech died in a choking mumble, stifled by the wet and sodden gag\r\nthey forced into his mouth.\r\n\r\nAbout him the mob seethed. Through his brain a quick anguish thrilled,\r\nthe thought of Beatrice unaided and alone. Then came a wonder when the\r\ndeath-stroke would fall--a frightful, sick despair that on the very\r\neve of triumph, of salvation for this Folk and for the world as well\r\nas for Beatrice and himself, this unforeseen catastrophe should have\r\nbefallen.\r\n\r\nHe struggled still to catch some glimpse of Beatrice, to cry aloud to\r\nher, to shield her; but, alone against five hundred, he was powerless.\r\n\r\nNowhere could he catch even a glimpse of the girl. In that shoving,\r\npushing, shouting horde, nothing could be made out. He knew not even\r\nwhether civil war had blazed or whether all alike had owned the rule\r\nof Kamrou the Terrible.\r\n\r\nLike buoys tossing upon the surface of a raging sea, the flaring\r\ntorches pitched and danced, rose, fell. And from a multitude of\r\nthroats, from beach and causeway, walls and town, strange shouts rang\r\nup into the all-embracing, vague, enshrouding vapor.\r\n\r\nStill striving to fight, bound as he was, he felt a great force\r\ndriving him along, on, on, up the beach and toward the village.\r\n\r\nMute, desperate, stark mad, he knew the Folk were half carrying, half\r\ndragging him up the causeway.\r\n\r\nAs in a dark dream, he vaguely saw the great fortified gate with its\r\nhuge, torch-lighted monolithic lintel. Even upon this some of the Folk\r\nwere crowded now to watch the strange, incredible spectacle of the man\r\nwho had once turned the tide of battle against the Lanskaarn and had\r\nsaved all their lives, now haled like a criminal back into the\r\ncommunity he had rescued in its hour of sorest need.\r\n\r\nHis mind leaped to their first entry into the village--it seemed\r\nmonths ago--also as prisoners. In a flash he recalled all that had\r\nhappened since and bitterly he mocked himself for having dared to\r\ndream that their influence had really altered these strange, barbarous\r\nsouls, or uplifted them, or taught them anything at all.\r\n\r\n\"Now, now just as the rescue of these people was at hand, just as the\r\nmachine might have carried us and them back into the world, slowly,\r\none by one--_now comes defeat and death!_\"\r\n\r\nAn exceeding great bitterness filled his soul once more at this harsh,\r\ncynic turn of fate. But most of all he yearned toward Beatrice. That\r\nhe should die mattered nothing; but the thought of this girl perishing\r\nat their hands there in the lost Abyss was dreadful as the pangs of\r\nall the fabled hells.\r\n\r\nAgain he fought to hold back, to try for some sight, even a fleeting\r\nglimpse of Beatrice; but the Folk with harsh cries drove him roughly\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nHe could not even see the patriarch. All was confusion, glare, smoke,\r\nnoise, as he was thrust through the fortified gate, out into the\r\nthronged plaza.\r\n\r\nEverywhere rose cries, shouts, vociferations, among which he could\r\ndistinguish only one a thousand times repeated: \"Kamrou! _Kamrou!_\"\r\n\r\nAnd through all his rage and bitter bafflement and pain, a sudden\r\ngreat desire welled up in him to see this chief of the Folk, at\r\nlast--to lay eyes on this formidable, this terrible one--to stand face\r\nto face with him in whose hand now lay everything, Kamrou!\r\n\r\nAcross the dim, fog-covered expanse of the plaza he saw the blue-green\r\nshimmer of the great flame.\r\n\r\nThither, toward that strange, eternal fire and the ghastly circle of\r\nthe headless skeletons the Folk were drifting now. Thither his captors\r\nwere dragging him.\r\n\r\nAnd there, he knew, Kamrou awaited Beatrice and him. There doom was to\r\nbe dealt out to them. There, and at once!\r\n\r\nThicker the press became. The flame was very near now, its droning\r\nroar almost drowning the great and growing babel of cries.\r\n\r\nOn, on the Folk bore him. All at once he saw again that two-pronged\r\ntorch raised before him, going ahead; and a way cleared through the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nAlong this way he was carried, no longer struggling, but eager now to\r\nknow the end, to meet it bravely and with calm philosophy, \"as fits a\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nAnd quite at once he found himself in sight of the many dangling\r\nskeletons. Now the quivering jet of the flame grew visible. Now,\r\nsuddenly, he was thrust forward into a smooth and open space. Silence\r\nfell.\r\n\r\nBefore him he saw Kamrou, Kamrou the Terrible, at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nGAGE OF BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief of the People of the Abyss was seated at his ease in\r\na large stone chair, over which heavy layers of weed-fabric had been\r\nthrown. He was flanked on either side by spearsmen and by drummers,\r\nwho still held their iron sticks poised above their copper drums with\r\nshark-skin heads.\r\n\r\nStern saw at a glance that he was a man well over six feet tall, with\r\nwhipcord muscles and a keen, eager, domineering air. Unlike any of the\r\nother Folk, his hair (snow-white) was not twisted into a fantastic\r\nknot and fastened with gold pins, but hung loose and was cut square\r\noff at about the level of his shoulders, forming a tremendous, bristly\r\nmass that reminded one of a lion's mane.\r\n\r\nAcross his left temple, and involving his left eye with a ghastly\r\nmutilation, ran a long, jagged, bright red scar, that stood out\r\nvividly against the milk-white skin. In his hands he held no mace, no\r\nsymbol of power; they rested loosely on his powerful knees; and in\r\ntheir half-crooked fingers, large and long, Stern knew there lay a\r\nformidable, an all but irresistible strength.\r\n\r\nAt sight of the captives--for Beatrice, too, now suddenly appeared,\r\nthrust forward through another lane among the Folk--Kamrou's keenly\r\ncruel face grew hard. His lips curled with a sneer of scorn and hate.\r\nHis pinkish eyes glittered with anticipation. Full on his face the\r\nflare of the great flame fell; Stern could see every line and wrinkle,\r\nand he knew that to beg mercy from this huge barbarian (even though he\r\nwould have begged), were a task wholly vain and futile.\r\n\r\nHe glanced along the circle of expectant faces that ringed the chief\r\nat a distance of some fifteen feet. Surely, thought he, some of the\r\nmany Folk that he and the girl had saved from butchery, some to whom\r\nthey had taught the rudiments of the world's lost arts, would now show\r\npity on them--would stand by them now!\r\n\r\nBut no; not one face of all that multitude--now that Kamrou had\r\nreturned--evinced other than eager interest to see the end of\r\neverything. To Stern flashed the thought that here, despite their\r\nseeming half-civilization in the use of metals, fire, dwellings,\r\nfabrics and all the rest, dwelt within them a savagery even below that\r\nof the ancient, long-extinct American Indians.\r\n\r\nAnd well he knew that if both he and Beatrice were not to die the\r\ndeath this day, only upon themselves they must depend!\r\n\r\nYes, one face showed pity. But only one--the patriarch's.\r\n\r\nStern suddenly caught sight of him, standing in the front rank of the\r\ncircled crowd, about twenty feet away to the left, just beyond the\r\ngirl. Tears gleamed in the old man's sightless eyes; his lips\r\nquivered; the engineer saw his hands tremble as he twisted the feeble,\r\nimpotent fingers together in anguish.\r\n\r\nAnd though he could catch no sound in that rising, falling,\r\never-roaring tumult of the flame, he knew the patriarch, with some\r\nvague and distant remnant of the old-time and vanished religion of the\r\nworld, was striving to pray.\r\n\r\nStern's eyes met the girl's. Neither could speak, for she, too, was\r\ngagged with a rough band of fabric which cruelly cut her beautiful,\r\nher tender mouth. At sight of her humiliation and her pain, the man's\r\nheart leaped hotly; he strained against his bonds till the veins\r\nswelled, and with eyes of terrible rage and hate stared at Kamrou.\r\n\r\nBut the chief's gaze was now fixed insolently upon Beatrice. She, as\r\nshe stood there, stripped even of her revolver and cartridge-belt,\r\nhands bound behind her, hair disheveled, had caught his barbarous\r\nfancy. And now in his look Stern saw the kindling of a savage passion\r\nso ardent, so consuming, that the man's heart turned sick within him.\r\n\r\n\"Ten thousand times better she should die!\" thought he, racked at the\r\nthought of what might be. \"Oh, God! If I only had my revolver for a\r\nsingle minute now! One shot for Kamrou--one for Beatrice--and after\r\nthat, nothing would matter; nothing!\"\r\n\r\nCame a disturbance in the Folk. Heads craned; a murmur of voices rose.\r\n\r\nThe patriarch, no longer trembling, but with his head held proudly up,\r\nboth hands outstretched, had stepped into the circle. And now,\r\nadvancing toward Kamrou, he spoke in quick and eager sentences--he\r\ngestured at the engineer, raised his hand on high, bowed and stepped\r\nback.\r\n\r\nAnd all at once a wild, harsh, swelling chorus of cries arose; every\r\nface turned toward Stern; the engineer, amazed, knew not what all this\r\nmeant, but to the ultimate drop in the arteries he pledged his\r\nfighting-blood to one last, bitter struggle.\r\n\r\nSilence again.\r\n\r\nKamrou had not stirred. Still his great hands rested on his knees; but\r\na thin, venomous smile lengthened his lips. He, too, looked at the\r\nengineer, who gave the stare back with redoubled hate. Tense grew the\r\nexpectation of the Folk.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil now?\" thought Stern, tautening event muscle for the\r\nexpected attack.\r\n\r\nBut attack there came none. Instead the patriarch asked a question of\r\nthose who stood near him; and hands now guided the old man toward the\r\nplace where Stern was standing, bound.\r\n\r\n\"O friend; O son!\" exclaimed the old man when he had come close. \"Now\r\nhearken! For, verily, this is the only way!\r\n\r\n\"It is an ancient custom of the Merucaans that any man captive or\r\nfree, can ever challenge our chief, whosoever he be, to the\r\ndeath-combat. If the chief wins, he remains chief. If he loses, the\r\nvictor takes his place. Many hundreds of years, I know not how long,\r\nthis has been our way. And many terrible combats have been seen here\r\namong our people.\r\n\r\n\"Kamrou has said that you must die, the girl must be his prize. Only\r\none way remains to save her and yourself--you must struggle with\r\nKamrou. I have delivered to him your challenge already. Let fate\r\ndecide the issue!\"\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to whirl before Stern's eyes, and for a moment all\r\ngrew black. In his ears sounded a great roaring, louder than the roar\r\nof the huge flame. Quick questions flashed through his mind. Fight\r\nKamrou? But how? A duel with revolvers? Spears? Maces?\r\n\r\nHe knew not. Only he knew that in whatever way the ancient combats\r\nmust be held he was ready!\r\n\r\n\"You affirm the challenge I have given in your behalf?\" demanded the\r\npatriarch. \"If you accept it, nod.\"\r\n\r\nStern nodded with all the vigor of his terrible rage. Kamrou's eyes\r\nnarrowed; his smile grew fixed and hard, but in it Stern perceived the\r\neasy contempt of a bully toward any chance weakling. And through him\r\nthrilled a passion of hate such as he had never dreamed in all his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nCame a quick word from the patriarch. Somebody was slashing the\r\nengineer's bonds. All at once the ropes gave way. Free and unfettered,\r\nhe stepped forward, stretching his arms, opening and closing his\r\ncramped, numbed hands, out into the ring toward Kamrou, the chief.\r\n\r\nOff came the gag. Stern could speak at last.\r\n\r\nHis first word was to the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice!\" he called to her, \"there's one chance left! I'm to fight\r\nthis ruffian here. If I beat him we're free--we own this tribe, body\r\nand soul! If not--\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off short. Even the possibility was not to be considered.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him and understood his secret thought. Well the man knew\r\nthat Beatrice would die by her own hand before Kamrou should have his\r\nway with her.\r\n\r\nThe patriarch spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"My son,\" said he, \"there is but one way for all these combats. It has\r\nbeen so these many centuries. By the smooth edge of the great boiling\r\npit the fights are held. Man against man it is. Verily, you two with\r\nonly your hands must fight! He who loses--\"\r\n\r\n\"Goes into the pit?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man nodded.\r\n\r\n\"There is no other way,\" he answered. \"The new, terrible weapons you\r\ncannot use. The arrows, slings and spears are all forbidden by ancient\r\ncustom. It is the naked grasp of the hands, the strong muscles of two\r\nmen against each other! So we decide our chief!\r\n\r\n\"I, alas, can help you in nothing. I am powerless, weak, old. Were I\r\nto interfere now and try to change this way, my own body would only go\r\nto the pit, and my old bones hang, headless, in the place of captives\r\nand criminals. All lies in your hands, my son!\r\n\r\n\"All; everything! Our whole future, and the future of the world! If\r\nyou lose, the wonderful machine will be destroyed and all its metal\r\nforged into spears and battle axes. Barbarism will conquer; darkness\r\nwill continue, and war, and death. All will be forever lost!\r\n\r\n\"The last ray of hope, of light, from the great past of the upper\r\nworld, will vanish forever! Your own death, my son, and the fate of\r\nthe girl, will be as nothing beside the terrible catastrophe, if you\r\nare beaten.\r\n\r\n\"For, verily, it will be the death of the world!\r\n\r\n\"And now, my son, now go to battle--to battle for this woman, for\r\nyourself, for us, for the future of our race, for everything!\r\n\r\n\"Kamrou is ready. The pit is boiling.\r\n\r\n\"Go now! Fight--and--and--\"\r\n\r\nHis voice was lost in a great tumult of cries, yells, shouts. Spears\r\nbrandished. Came a sound of shields struck with clubs and axes. The\r\ncopper drums again began to throb and clang.\r\n\r\nKamrou had risen from his seat.\r\n\r\nStern knew the supreme moment of his life was at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL STRUGGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nKamrou flung off his long and heavy cloak. He stood there in\r\nthe flamelight, broad-chested, beautifully muscled, lean of hip, the\r\nperfect picture of a fighting man. Naked he was, save for his\r\nloin-cloth. And still he smiled.\r\n\r\nStern likewise stripped away his own cloak. Clad only like the chief,\r\nhe faced him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now,\" said he, \"here goes! And may the best man win!\"\r\n\r\nKamrou waved the circle back at one side. It opened, revealing the\r\ngreat pit to southward of the flame. Stern saw the vapors rising,\r\nbluish in that strange light, from the perpetual boiling of the black\r\nwaters in its depths. Oddly enough, even at that moment a stray bit of\r\nscientific thought nicked into his consciousness--the memory that\r\nunder compressed air water boils only at very high temperatures. Down\r\nhere, in this great pressure, the water must easily be over three\r\nhundred degrees to seethe like that.\r\n\r\nHe, too, smiled.\r\n\r\n\"So much the better,\" thought he. \"The hotter, the sooner it's all\r\nover for the man who goes!\"\r\n\r\nUp rose numbers of the two-pronged torches. Stern got confused\r\nglimpses of the Folk--he saw the terrible, barbaric eagerness with\r\nwhich they now anticipated this inevitable tragedy of at least one\r\nhuman death in its most awful form.\r\n\r\nBeatrice he no longer saw. Where was she? He knew not. But in a long,\r\nlast cry of farewell he raised his voice. Then, with Kamrou, he strode\r\ntoward the steaming, boiling pit in the smooth rock floor.\r\n\r\nTwo tall men broke through the tensely eager throng. In their hands\r\nthey bore each a golden jar, curiously shaped and chiseled, and\r\nbearing a whimsical resemblance to a coffee-urn.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil now?\" wondered Stern, eager to be at work. He saw at\r\nonce the meaning of the jars. One of the bearers approached Kamrou.\r\nThe other came to him. They raised the vessels, and over the\r\nantagonists' bare bodies poured a thin, warm stream of some\r\nrank-smelling oil. All over the skin they rubbed it, till the bodies\r\nglistened strangely in the flamelight. Then, with muttered words he\r\ncould not catch, they withdrew.\r\n\r\nAll seemed confused and vague to Stern as in a painful dream. Images\r\nand pictures seemed to present themselves to his brain. The light, the\r\nfog and heat, the rising stream, the roaring of the flame, and over\r\nall the throb-throb-throb of those infernal copper drums worked\r\npowerfully on his senses.\r\n\r\nAlready he seemed to feel the grip of Kamrou, the pangs of the hard\r\nstruggle, the sudden plunge into the vat of scalding death.\r\n\r\nWith a strong effort he flung off these fancies and faced his sneering\r\nfoe, who now--his red-wealed face puckered into a malicious\r\ngrin--stood waiting.\r\n\r\nStern all at once saw the patriarch once more.\r\n\r\n\"Go, son!\" cried the old man. \"Now is the moment! When the drums\r\ncease, lay hold of him!\"\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke, the great drums slowed their beat, then stopped.\r\n\r\nStern, with a final thought of Beatrice, advanced.\r\n\r\nAll the advantage lay with Kamrou. Familiar with the place was he, and\r\nwith the rules of this incredible contest. Everywhere about him stood\r\ncrowding hundreds of his Foll; owing him their allegiance, hostile to\r\nthe newcomer, the man from another world. Out of all that multitude\r\nonly two hearts' beat in sympathy and hope for him; only two human\r\nbeings gave him their thoughts and their support--a helpless girl; a\r\nfeeble, blind old man.\r\n\r\nKamrou stood taller, too, than Stern, and certainly bulked heavier. He\r\nwas in perfect condition, while Stern had not yet fully recovered from\r\nthe fight in the Abyss, from the great change in living conditions\r\nthere in the depths, and--more important still--from the harsh blow of\r\nthe rock that had numbed his elbow on the beach.\r\n\r\nHis arms and hands, too, still felt the cramping of the cords that had\r\nbound him. He needed a few hours yet to work them into suppleness and\r\nperfect strength. But respite there was none.\r\n\r\nHe must fight now at once under all handicaps, or die--and in his\r\ndeath yield Beatrice to the barbaric passions of the chief.\r\n\r\nOddly enough there recurred to his mind, as he drew near the waiting,\r\nsneering Kamrou, that brave old war-cry of the Greeks of Xenophon as\r\nthey hurled themselves against the vastly greater army of the\r\nPersians--\"Zeus Sotor kai Nike!--Zeus Savior and victory!\"\r\n\r\nThe shout burst from his lips. Forward he ran, on to the battle where\r\neither he or the barbarian must perish in the boiling pit--forward,\r\n_to what? To victory--to death?_\r\n\r\nKamrou stood fast till Stern's right hand had almost gripped his\r\nthroat--for Stern, the challenger, had to deliver the first attack.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he slipped aside; and as Stern swerved for him, made a\r\nquick leap.\r\n\r\nWith an agility, a strength and skill tiger-like and marvelous, he\r\ncaught Stern round the waist, whirled him and would have dashed him\r\ntoward the pit. But already the engineer's right arm was under\r\nKamrou's left; the right hand had him by the throat, and Kamrou's head\r\nwent sharply back till the vertebrae strained hard.\r\n\r\nEel-like, elusive, oiled, the chief broke the hold, even as he flung a\r\nleg about one of Stern's.\r\n\r\nA moment they swayed, tugging, straining, panting. In the old days\r\nStern would not for one moment have been a match for this barbaric\r\nathlete, but the long months of life close to nature had hardened him\r\nand toughened every fiber. And now a stab of joy thrilled through him\r\nas he realized that in his muscles lay at least a force to balk the\r\nsavage for a little while.\r\n\r\nTo Stern came back his wrestling lore of the very long ago, the days\r\nof Harvard, in the dim, vanished past. He freed his left arm from the\r\ngorilla-like grip of Kamrou, and, quick as lightning, got a\r\njiu-jitsu stranglehold.\r\n\r\nThe savage choked, gurgled, writhed; his face grew purple with\r\nstagnant blood. Then he leaped, dragging the engineer with him; they\r\nfell, rolled, twisted--and Stern's hold was broken.\r\n\r\nA great shout rose as Kamrou struggled up and once more seized the\r\nAmerican. He raised him like a child, and took a step, two, three,\r\ntoward the infernal caldron in the rock floor.\r\n\r\nStern, desperate, wrenched his oiled arms clear. A second later they\r\nhad closed again about the chief's throat--the one point of attack\r\nthat Stern had chosen for his best.\r\n\r\nThe barbarian faltered. Grunting, panting, he shook the engineer as a\r\ndog shakes a rat, but the hold was secure. Kamrou's great arms wrapped\r\nthemselves in a formidable \"body-scissors\" grip; Stern felt the breath\r\nsqueezed from his body.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the chief's oily heel slipped on the smooth-worn rock,\r\nnot ten feet from the lip of the bubbling vat--and for the second time\r\nboth fell.\r\n\r\nThis time Stern was atop. Over they rolled, once, twice, straining\r\nwith madness. Stern's thumbs were sunk deep in the throat of the\r\nbarbarian at either side. As he gouged harder, deeper, he felt the\r\nterrific pounding of the chief's jugular. Hot on his own neck panted\r\nthe choking breath of Kamrou. Oh, could he only hold that grip a\r\nminute longer--even a half-minute!\r\n\r\nBut already his own breath was gone. A buzzing filled his ears;\r\nsparkling lights danced, quivering before his eyes. The blood seemed\r\nbursting his brain; far off and vague he heard the droning of the\r\nflame, the shouts and cries of the great horde of watchers.\r\n\r\nA whiff of steam--hot, damp, terrifying--passed across his face, in\r\nwhich the veins were starting from the oily skin. His eyes, half\r\nclosed, bulged from the sockets. He knew the pit was very close now;\r\ndully he heard its steady bubbling.\r\n\r\n\"If I go--he goes, too!\" the engineer swore to himself. \"He'll never\r\nhave--Beatrice--anyway!\"\r\n\r\nOver and over they rolled, their grips tight-locked as steel. Now\r\nKamrou was on top, now Stern. But the chief's muscles were still\r\nstrong as ever; Stern's already had begun to weaken.\r\n\r\nStrive as he might, he could not get another hold, nor could he throw\r\nanother ounce of power into that he already had. Up, up, slowly up\r\nslipped the chief's arms; Stern knew the savage meant to throttle him;\r\nand once those long, prehensile fingers reached his throat, good-by!\r\n\r\nThen it seemed to him a voice, very far and small, was speaking to\r\nhim, coolly, impersonally, in a matter-of-fact way as though\r\nsuggesting an experiment.\r\n\r\nDazed as he was, he recognized that voice--it was the voice of Dr.\r\nHarbutt, who once had taught him many a wily trick upon the mat;\r\nHarbutt, dead and gone these thousand years or more.\r\n\r\n\"Why not try the satsu-da, Stern?\" the voice was saying. \"Excellent,\r\nat times.\"\r\n\r\nThough Stern's face was black and swollen, eyes shut and mouth all\r\ntwisted awry in this titanic struggle with the ape-hold of the huge\r\nchief, yet the soul within him calmly smiled.\r\n\r\nThe satsu-da--yes, he remembered it now, strongest and best of all\r\nthe jiu-jitsu feats.\r\n\r\nAnd, suddenly loosening his hands from the chief's throat, he clenched\r\nhis right fist, hard as steel.\r\n\r\nA second later the \"killing-blow\" had fallen on the barbarian's neck,\r\njust where the swelling protuberance behind the ear marked the vital\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nTerrible was the force of that blow, struck for his own life, for the\r\nhonor of Beatrice, the salvation of the world.\r\n\r\nKamrou gave a strange grunt. His head fell backward. Both eyes closed;\r\nthe mouth lolled open and a glairy froth began to trickle down.\r\n\r\nThe frightful grip of the long, hairy arms relaxed. Exhausted, Stern\r\nfell prone right on the slippery edge of the boiling pit.\r\n\r\nHe felt a sudden scalding dash of water, steam and boiling spray; he\r\nheard a sudden splash, then a wild, barbarous, long-drawn howling of\r\nthe massed Folk.\r\n\r\nLying there, spent, gasping, all but dead in the thick steam-drift of\r\nthe vat, he opened his eyes.\r\n\r\nKamrou was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nSeemingly very distant, he heard the copper drums begin to beat once\r\nmore with feverish haste.\r\n\r\nA great, compelling lassitude enveloped him. He knew no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SUN OF SPRING\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What altitude now? Can you make-out, Allan?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. The aneroid's only good up to five miles. We must have made two\r\nhundred, vertically, since this morning. The way the propeller takes\r\nhold and the planes climb in this condensed air is just a miracle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Two passengers at that!\" Beatrice answered, leaning back in her seat\r\nagain. She turned to the patriarch, who, sitting in an extra place in\r\nthe thoroughly overhauled and newly equipped Pauillac, was holding\r\nwith nervous hands to the wire stays in front of him.\r\n\r\n\"Patience, father,\" she cheered him. \"Two hours more--not over three,\r\nat the outside--and you shall breathe the upper air again! For the\r\nfirst time the sunlight shall fall upon your face!\"\r\n\r\n\"The sun! The sun! Oh, is it possible?\" murmured the aged man.\r\n\"Verily, I had never thought to live until this day! _The sun!_\"\r\n\r\nCame silence between these three for a time, while the strong heart of\r\nthe machine beat steadily; and the engineer, with deft and skilful\r\nhand, guided it in wide-swept spirals upward, ever up, up, up, back\r\ntoward the realms of day, of life, once more; up through the fogs and\r\nclouds, away from heat and dark and mystery, toward the clear, pure,\r\nrefreshing air of heaven again.\r\n\r\nAt last Stern spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Well, father,\" said he, \"I never would have thought it; but you were\r\nright, after all! They're like so much clay in the potter's hand now,\r\nfor me. I see I can do with them whatever I will.\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid some of them might object, after all, to any such\r\nproposition. It's one thing for them to accept me as boss down there,\r\nand quite another for them to consent to wholesale transplanting, such\r\nas we've got under way. But I can't see any possible reason why--with\r\nplenty of time and patience--the thing can't be accomplished all\r\nright. The main difficulty was their consent; and now we've got that,\r\nthe rest is mere detail and routine work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Time and patience,\" repeated the girl. \"Those are our watchwords now,\r\nboy. And we've got lots of both, haven't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two passengers each trip,\" the engineer continued, more practical\r\nthan she, \"and three trips a week, at the most, makes six of the Folk\r\nlanded on the surface weekly. In other words, it'll take--\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter about that now!\" interrupted Beatrice. \"We've got all the\r\ntime there is! Even if it takes five years, what of that? What are\r\nmonths or even years in the life-history of the world?\"\r\n\r\nStern kept silence again. In his mind he was revolving a hundred vital\r\nquestions of shelter, feeding, acclimatization for these men, now to\r\nbe transported from a place of dark and damp and heat to the strange\r\nouter regions of the surface-world.\r\n\r\nPlainly he saw it would be a task of unparalleled skill, delicacy, and\r\ndifficult accomplishment; but his spirits rose only the higher as he\r\nfaced its actual details. After all that he and Beatrice had been\r\nthrough since their wakening in the tower, he feared no failure to\r\nsolve any questions that now might rise. By care, by keeping the Folk\r\nat first in caves, then gradually accustoming them to stronger and\r\nbrighter light, more air, more cold, he knew he could bridge the gap\r\nof centuries in a few years.\r\n\r\nEver adaptable, the human body would respond to changed environments.\r\nPatience and time--these would solve all!\r\n\r\nAnd as for this Folk's barbarism, it mattered not. Much better such\r\nstock to rebuild from than some mild, supine race of far higher\r\nculture. To fight the rough battles of life and re-establishment still\r\nahead, the bold and warlike Merucaans were all that he could wish.\r\n\r\n\"Imagine _me_ as a school-teacher,\" suddenly exclaimed the girl,\r\nlaughing: \"giving the children A B C and making them read: 'I see the\r\ncat'--when there _aren't_ any cats nowadays--no tame ones, anyhow!\r\nImagine--\"\r\n\r\n\"Sh-h-h!\" cautioned Stern. \"Don't waste your energies imagining\r\nthings just yet. There's more than enough real work, food-getting,\r\nhouse-building in caves, and all that, before we ever get to schools.\r\nThat's years ahead yet, education is!\"\r\n\r\nSilence again, save for the strong and ceaseless chatter of the\r\nengine, that, noisy as a score of mowing machines, flung its\r\nindomitable challenge to gravitation out into the fathomless void on\r\nevery hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Allan! Allan! Oh, a star! Look, look! _A\r\nstar!_\"\r\n\r\nThe girl was first to see that blest and wondrous thing. Hours had\r\npassed, long, weary hours; steadily the air-pressure had sunk, the\r\nvapors thinned; but light had not yet filtered through the mists. And\r\nAllan's mind had been sore troubled thereat. He had not thought of the\r\nsimple reason that they were reaching the surface at night.\r\n\r\nBut now he knew, and as she cried to him \"A star!\" he, too, looked and\r\nsaw it, and as though he had been a little child he felt the sudden\r\ntears start to his weary eyes.\r\n\r\n\"A star!\" he answered. \"Oh, thank God--a star!\"\r\n\r\nIt faded almost at once, as vapors shrouded it; but soon it came\r\nagain, and others, many more; and now the first breath of the cool and\r\nblessed outer air was wafted to them.\r\n\r\nUsed as they had been, all these long months--for now the year had\r\nturned again and early spring was coming up the world--used to the\r\nclosed and stifling atmosphere of the Abyss, its chemicalized fogs and\r\nmists, the first effect of the pure surface-air was almost\r\nintoxicating as they mounted higher, higher, toward the lip of the\r\ntitanic gulf.\r\n\r\nThe patriarch, trembling with eagerness and with exhaustion--for he\r\nwas very old and now his vital forces were all but spent--breathed it\r\nonly with difficulty. Rapid was his respiration; on either pallid\r\ncheek a strange and vivid patch of color showed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Stars? You see them--really see them?\" faltered he. \"Oh, for my sight\r\nagain! Oh, that I might see them once, only once, those wonderful\r\nthings of ancient story! Then, verily, I should be glad to die!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMidnight.\r\n\r\nHard-driven now for many hours, heated, yet still running true, the\r\nPauillac had at length made a safe landing on the western verge of the\r\nAbyss. Again the voyagers felt solid earth beneath their feet. By the\r\nclear starlight Stern had brought the machine to earth on a little\r\nplateau, wooded in part, partly bare sand. Numb and stiff, he had\r\nalighted from the driver's seat, and had helped both passengers\r\nalight,\r\n\r\nThe girl, radiant with joy, had kissed him full upon the lips; the\r\npatriarch had fallen on his knees, and, gathering a handful of the\r\nsand--the precious surface of the earth, long fabled among his Folk,\r\nlong worshipped in his deepest reveries--had clasped it to his thin\r\nand heaving breast.\r\n\r\nIf he had known how to pray he would have worshipped there. But even\r\nthough his lips were silent, his attitude, his soul were all one vast\r\nand heartfelt prayer--prayer to the mother-earth, the unseen stars,\r\nthe night, the wind upon his brow, the sweet and subtle airs of heaven\r\nthat enfolded him like a caress.\r\n\r\nStern wrapped the old man in a spare mantle, for the night was chill,\r\nthen made a crackling fire on the sands. Worn out, they rested, all.\r\nLittle they said. The beauty and majesty of night now--seen again\r\nafter long absence--a hundred times more solemn than they had ever\r\nknown it, kept the two Americans from speech. And the old man, buried\r\nin his own thoughts, sat by the fire, burning with a fever of\r\nimpatient longings for the dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive o'clock.\r\n\r\nNow all across the eastern sky, shrouded as it was with the slow,\r\nsilent mist-wreaths rising ghostly from the Abyss, delicate pink and\r\npearl-gray tints were spreading, shading above to light blues and to\r\npurples of exquisite depth and clarity.\r\n\r\nNo cloud flecked the sky, the wondrous sky of early spring. Dawn, pure\r\nas on the primal day, was climbing from the eastern depths. And,\r\nthrilled by that eternal miracle, the man and woman, hand in hand,\r\nawaited the full coming of the light.\r\n\r\nThe patriarch spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Is the sun nigh arisen now?\" he queried in a strange, awed voice,\r\ntrembling with eagerness and deep emotion. \"Is it coming, at last--the\r\nsun?\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll be here now before long, father,\" answered Stern.\r\n\r\n\"From which direction does it come? Am I facing it?\" he asked, with\r\npitiful anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"You're facing it. The first rays will fall on you. Only be patient. I\r\npromise you it shall not fail!\"\r\n\r\nA pause. Then the aged man spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"Remember, oh, my children,\" said he, with terrible earnestness, \"all\r\nthat I have told you, all that you must know. Remember how to deal\r\nwith my people. They are as children in your hands. Be very patient,\r\nvery firm and wise; all will be well.\r\n\r\n\"Remember my warnings of the Great Vortex, so very far below our sea,\r\nthe Lanskaarn, and all those other perils of the Abyss whereof I have\r\nspoken. Remember, too, all the traditions of the Cave of Records. Some\r\nday, when all else is accomplished, you may find that cave. I have\r\ntold you everything I know of its location. Seek it some day, and find\r\nthe history of the dead, buried past, from the time of the great\r\ncatastrophe to the final migration when my ancestors sought the lower\r\nsea.\"\r\n\r\nAnother silence. All three were too deeply moved for any speech. And\r\never mounting higher, brighter and more clear, dawn flung its glories\r\nwide across the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Help me that I may stand, to greet the day!\" at last the patriarch\r\nsaid. \"I cannot rise, alone.\"\r\n\r\nStern and the girl, each taking an arm, got him to his feet. He stood\r\nthere facing the east, priestlike in venerable and solemn worship of\r\nthe coming sun.\r\n\r\n\"Give me each a hand, my children,\" he commanded. In Stern's hand,\r\nstrong, corded, toil-worn, he laid the girl's.\r\n\r\n\"Thus do I give you each to each,\" said he. \"Thus do I make you one!\"\r\n\r\nStern drew Beatrice into his arms. Blind though the old man was, he\r\nsensed the act, and smiled. A great and holy peace had shrouded him.\r\n\r\n\"Only that I may feel the sun upon my face!\" breathed he.\r\n\r\nAll at once a thinning cloud-haze let the light glow through.\r\n\r\nBeatrice looked at Stern. He shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" he answered.\r\n\r\nSwiftly uprose the sun. The morning wind dispelled the shrouding\r\nvapors.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what is this warmth?\" exclaimed the patriarch, trembling\r\nviolently. \"What is this warmth, this glow upon my face? This life,\r\nthis--\"\r\n\r\nOut toward the east he stretched both hands. Instinctively the\r\npriestlike worship of the sun, old when the world was still in\r\ninfancy, surged back to him again after the long, lost centuries of\r\ndarkness and oblivion.\r\n\r\n\"The sun! _The sun!_\" he cried, his voice triumphant as a\r\ntrumpet-call. Tears coursed from his blind eyes; but on his lips a\r\nsmile of joy unutterable was set.\r\n\r\n\"The sun! _At last! The_--\"\r\n\r\nStern caught his feeble body as he fell.\r\n\r\nDown on the sands they laid him. To the stilled heart Stern laid his\r\near.\r\n\r\nTears were in his eyes, too, and in the girl's, as Stern shook his\r\nhead, silently.\r\n\r\nUp over the time-worn, the venerable, the kindly face they drew the\r\nmantle, but not before each had reverently kissed the wrinkled\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\"Better thus,\" whispered the engineer. \"Far better, every way. He had\r\nhis wish; he felt the sunshine on his face; his outgoing spirit must\r\nbe mingled with that worshipped light and air and sky--with dawn--with\r\nspringtime--\"\r\n\r\n\"With life itself!\" said Beatrice.\r\n\r\nAnd through her tears she smiled, while higher rose the warm,\r\nlife-giving sun of spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\nTHE AFTERGLOW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nDEATH, LIFE, AND LOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nLife! Life again, and light, the sun and the fresh winds of\r\nheaven, the perfect azure of a June sky, the perfume of the passionate\r\nred blooms along the lips of the chasm, the full-throated song of\r\nhidden birds within the wood to eastward--life, beauty, love--such,\r\nthe sunrise hour when Allan and the girl once more stood side by side\r\nin the outer world, delivered from the perils of the black Abyss.\r\n\r\nHardly more real than a disordered nightmare now, the terrible fall\r\ninto those depths, the captivity among the white barbarians, the\r\nbattles and the ghastly scenes of war, the labors, the perilous\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nAll seemed to fall and fade away from these two lovers, all save their\r\njoy in life and in each other, their longing for the inevitable\r\ngreater passion, pain and joy, their clear-eyed outlook into the vast\r\nand limitless possibilities of the future, their future and the\r\nworld's.\r\n\r\nAnd as they stood there, hand in hand beside the body of the fallen\r\npatriarch--he whose soul had passed in peace, even at the moment of\r\nhis life's fulfilment, his knowledge of the sun--awe overcame them\r\nboth. With a new tenderness, mingled with reverent adoration, Stern\r\ndrew the girl once more to him.\r\n\r\nHer face turned up to his and her arms tightened about his neck. He\r\nkissed her brow beneath the parted masses of her wondrous hair. His\r\nlips rested a moment on her eyes; and then his mouth sought hers and\r\nburned its passion into her very soul.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she pushed him back, panting. She had gone white; she\r\ntrembled in his clasp.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your kiss--oh, Allan, what is this I feel?--it seems to choke\r\nme!\" she gasped, clutching her full bosom where her heart leaped like\r\na prisoned creature. \"Your kiss--it is so different now! No, no--not\r\nagain--_not yet!_\"\r\n\r\nHe released her, for he, too was shaking in the grip of new, fierce\r\npassions.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me!\" he whispered. \"I--I forgot myself, a moment. Not\r\nyet--no, not yet. You're right, Beatrice. A thousand things are\r\npressing to be done. And love--must wait!\"\r\n\r\nHe clenched his fists and strode to the edge of the chasm, where, for\r\na while, he stood alone and silent, gazing far down and away,\r\nmastering himself, striving to get himself in leash once more.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he turned and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Beta,\" said he. \"All this must be forgotten. Let's get to work.\r\nThe whole world's waiting for us, for our labor. It's eager for our\r\ntoil!\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. In her eyes the fire had died, and now only the light of\r\ncomradeship and trust and hope glowed once again.\r\n\r\n\"Allan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our first duty--\" She gestured toward the body of the patriarch,\r\nnobly still beneath the rough folds of the mantle they had drawn over\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe understood.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" murmured he. \"And his grave shall be for all the future ages a\r\nplace of pilgrimage and solemn thought. Where first, one of lost Folk\r\nissued again into the world and where he died, this shall be a\r\nmonument of the new time now coming to its birth.\r\n\r\n\"His grave shall lie here on this height, where the first sun shall\r\neach day for ages fall upon it, supreme in its deep symbolism. Forever\r\nit shall be a memorial, not of death, but life, of liberty, of hope!\"\r\n\r\nThey kept a moment's silence, then Stern added.\r\n\r\n\"So now, to work!\" From the biplane he fetched the ax. With this he\r\ncut and trimmed a branch from a near-by fir. He sharpened it to a flat\r\nblade three or four inches across. In the deep red sand along the edge\r\nof the Abyss he set to work, scooping the patriarch's grave.\r\n\r\nIn silence Beatrice took the ax and also labored, throwing the sand\r\naway. Together, in an hour, they had dug a trench sufficiently deep\r\nand wide.\r\n\r\n\"This must do, for now,\" said Stern, looking up at last. \"Some time he\r\nshall have fitting burial, but for the present we can do no more. Let\r\nus now commit his body to the earth, the Great Mother which created\r\nand which waits always to give everlasting sleep, peace, rest.\"\r\n\r\nTogether, silently, they bore him to the grave, still wrapped in the\r\ncloak which now had become his shroud. Once more they gazed upon the\r\nnoble face of him they had grown to love in the long weeks of the\r\nAbyss, when only he had understood them or seemed near.\r\n\r\n\"What is this, Allan?\" asked the girl, touching a fine chain of gold\r\nabout the patriarch's neck, till now unnoticed.\r\n\r\nAllan drew at the chain, and a small golden cylinder was revealed,\r\ncuriously carven. Its lightness told him it was hollow.\r\n\r\n\"Some treasure of his, I imagine,\" judged he.\r\n\r\n\"Some record, perhaps? Oughtn't we to look?\"\r\n\r\nHe thought a moment in silence, then detached the chain.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said he. \"It can't help him now. It may help us. He himself\r\nwould have wanted us to have it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd into the pocket of his rough, brown cassock, woven of the\r\nweed-fiber of the dark sea, he slid the chain and golden cylinder.\r\n\r\nA final kiss they gave the patriarch, each; then, carefully wrapping\r\nhis face so that no smallest particle of sand should come in contact\r\nwith it, stood up. At each other they gazed, understandingly.\r\n\r\n\"Flowers? Some kind of service?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. All we can do for him will be too little!\"\r\n\r\nTogether they brought armfuls of the brilliant crimson and purple\r\nblooms along the edge of the sands, where forest and barren\r\nirregularly met; and with these, fir and spruce boughs, the longer to\r\nkeep his grave freshly green.\r\n\r\nAll about him they heaped the blossoms. The patriarch lay at rest\r\namong beauties he never had beheld, colors arid fragrances that to him\r\nhad been but dim traditions of antiquity.\r\n\r\n\"I can't preach,\" said Stern. \"I'm not that kind, anyway, and in this\r\nnew world all that sort of thing is out of place. Let's just say\r\ngood-by, as to a friend gone on a long, long journey.\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice could no longer keep back her grief. Kneeling beside the\r\ngrave, she arranged the flowers and the evergreens, on which her tears\r\nfell shining.\r\n\r\n\"Dust unto dust!\" Stern said. \"To you, oh Mother Nature, we give back\r\nthe body of this friend, your son. May the breeze blow gently here,\r\nthe sun shine warm, and the birds forever sing his requiem. And may\r\nthose who shall come after us, when we too sleep, remember that in him\r\nwe had a friend, without whom the world never again could have hoped\r\nfor any new birth, any life! To him we say good-by--eternally! Dust\r\nunto dust; good-by!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-by!\" whispered the girl. Then, greatly overcome, she arose and\r\nwalked away.\r\n\r\nStern, with his naked hands, filled the shallow grave and, this done,\r\nrolled three large boulders onto it, to protect it from the prowling\r\nbeasts of the wild.\r\n\r\nBeatrice returned. They strewed more flowers and green boughs, and in\r\nsilence stood a while, gazing at the lowlier bed of their one friend\r\non earth.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Stern took her hand and drew her toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, Beatrice,\" said he, \"he is not dead. He still lives in\r\nour memories. His body, aged and full of pain, is gone, but his spirit\r\nstill survives in us--that indomitable sold which, buried alive in\r\nblindness and the dark, still strove to keep alive the knowledge and\r\ntraditions of the upper world, hopes of attaining it, and visions of a\r\nbetter time to be!\r\n\r\n\"Was ever greater human courage, faith or strength? Let us not grieve.\r\nLet us rather go away strengthened and inspired by this wonderful life\r\nthat has just passed. In us, let all his hopes and aspirations come to\r\nreality.\r\n\r\n\"His death was happy. It was as he wished it, Beatrice, for his one\r\ngreat ambition was fully granted--to know the reality of the upper\r\nworld, the winds of heaven and the sun! Impossible for him to have\r\nsurvived the great change. Death was inevitable and right. He wanted\r\nrest, and rest is his, at last.\r\n\r\n\"We must be true to all he thought us, you and I--to all he believed\r\nus, even demigods! He shall inspire and enlighten us, O my love; and\r\nwith his memory to guide us, faith and fortitude shall not be lacking.\r\n\r\n\"Now, we must go. Work waits for us. Everything is yet to be planned\r\nand done. The world and its redemption lie before us. Come!\"\r\n\r\nHe led the girl away. As by mutual understanding they returned to\r\nwhere the biplane lay, symbol of their conquest of nature, epitome of\r\nhopes.\r\n\r\nNear it, on the edge of the Abyss, they rested, hand in hand. In\r\nsilence they sat thinking, for a space. And ever higher and more\r\nwarmly burned the sun; the breeze of June was sweet to them, long-used\r\nto fogs and damp and dark; the boundless flood of light across the\r\nazure thrilled them with aspiration and with joy.\r\n\r\nLife had begun again for them and for the world, life, even there in\r\nthe presence of death. Life was continuing, developing,\r\nexpanding--life and its immortal sister, Love!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEASTWARD HO!\r\n\r\n\r\nPractical matters now for a time thrust introspection, dreams\r\nand sentiment aside. The morning was already half spent, and in spite\r\nof sorrow, hunger had begun to assert itself; for since time was, no\r\ntwo such absolutely vigorous and healthy humans had ever set foot on\r\nearth as Beatrice and Allan.\r\n\r\nThe man gathered brush and dry-kye and proceeded to make a fire, not\r\nfar from the precipice, but well out of sight of the patriarch's\r\ngrave. He fetched a generous heap of wood from the neighboring forest,\r\nand presently a snapping blaze flung its smoke-banner down the breeze.\r\n\r\nSoon after Beatrice had raided the supplies on board the\r\nPauillac--fish, edible seaweed, and the eggs of the strange birds of\r\nthe Abyss--and with the skill and speed of long experience was getting\r\nan excellent meal. Allan meantime brought water from a spring near by.\r\nAnd the two ate in silence, cross-legged on the warm, dry sand.\r\n\r\n\"What first, now?\" queried the man, when they were satisfied. \"I've\r\nbeen thinking of about fifteen hundred separate things to tackle, each\r\none more important than all the others put together. How are we going\r\nto begin again? That's the question!\"\r\n\r\nShe drew from her warm bosom the golden cylinder and chain.\r\n\r\n\"Before we make any move at all,\" she answered, \"I think we ought to\r\nsee what's in this record--if it _is_ a record. Don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, you're right! Shall I open it for you?\"\r\n\r\nBut already the massively chased top lay unscrewed in her hand. Within\r\nthe cylinder a parchment roll appeared.\r\n\r\nA moment later she had spread it on her knee, taking care not to tear\r\nthe ancient, crackling skin whereon faint lines of writing showed.\r\n\r\nStern bent forward, eager and breathless. The girl, too, gazed with\r\nanxious eyes at the dim script, all but illegible with age and wear.\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Allan,\" said she. \"This _is_ some kind of record, some\r\ndirection as to the final history of the few survivors after the great\r\ncatastrophe. Oh! Look, Allan--it's fading already in the sunlight.\r\nQuick, read it quick, or we shall lose it all!\"\r\n\r\nOnly too true. The dim lines, perhaps fifteen hundred years old,\r\ncertainly never exposed to sunlight since more than a thousand, were\r\nalready growing weaker; and the parchment, too, seemed crumbling into\r\ndust. Its edges, where her fingers held it, already were breaking away\r\ninto a fine, impalpable powder.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, Allan! Quick!\"\r\n\r\nTogether they read the clumsy scrawl, their eyes leaping along the\r\nlines, striving to grasp the meaning ere it were too late.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ANY WHO AT ANY TIME MAY EVER REVISIT THE\r\nUPPER WORLD: Be it known that two records have been left covering our\r\nhistory from the time of the cataclysm in 1920 till we entered the\r\nChasm in 1957. One is in the Great Cave in Medicine Bow Range,\r\nColorado, near the ruins of Dexter. Exact location, 106 degrees, 11\r\nminutes, 3 seconds west; 40 degrees, 22 minutes, 6 seconds north.\r\nRecord is in left, or northern branch of Cave, 327 yards from mouth,\r\non south wall, 4 feet 6 inches from floor. The other--\r\n\r\n\"Where? Where?\" cried Beatrice. A portion of the record was gone; it\r\nhad crumbled even as they read.\r\n\r\n\"Easy does it, girl! Don't get excited,\" Allan cautioned, but his face\r\nwas pale and his hand trembled as he sought to steady and protect the\r\nparchment from the breeze.\r\n\r\nTogether they pieced out a few of the remaining words, for now the\r\nwriting was but a pale blur, momently becoming dimmer and more dim.\r\n\r\n... Cathedral on ... known as Storm King ... River ... crypt under ...\r\nthis was agreed on ... never returned but may possibly ... signed by\r\nus on this 12th day ...\r\n\r\nThey could read no more, for now the record was but a disintegrating\r\nshell in the girl's hands, and even as they looked the last of the\r\nwriting vanished, as breath evaporates from a window-pane.\r\n\r\nAllan whirled toward the fire, snatched out a still-glowing stick, and\r\nin the sand traced figures.\r\n\r\n\"Quick! What was that? 106-11-3, West--Forty--\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty, 22, north,\" she prompted.\r\n\r\n\"How many seconds? You remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" Slowly she shook her head. \"Five, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\nEagerly he peered at the record, but every trace was gone.\r\n\r\n\"Well, no matter about the seconds,\" he judged. \"I'll enter these data\r\non our diary, in the Pauillac, anyhow. We can remember the ruins of\r\nDexter and Medicine Bow Range; also the cathedral on Storm King. Put\r\nthe fragments of the parchment back into the case, Beta. Maybe we can\r\nyet preserve them, and by some chemical means or other bring out the\r\nwriting again. As it is, I guess we've got the most important facts;\r\nenough to go on, at any rate.\"\r\n\r\nShe replaced the crumbled record in the golden cylinder and once more\r\nscrewed on the cap. Allan got up and walked to the aeroplane, where,\r\namong their scanty effects, was the brief diary and set of notes he\r\nhad been keeping since the great battle with the Lanskaarn.\r\n\r\nWriting on his fish-skin tablets, with his bone stylus, dipped in his\r\nlittle stone jar of cuttle-fish ink, he carefully recorded the\r\ngeographical location. Then he went back to Beatrice, who still sat in\r\nthe midmorning sunlight by the fire, very beautiful and dear to him.\r\n\r\n\"If we can find those records, we'll have made a long step toward\r\nsolving the problem of how to handle the Folk. They aren't exactly\r\nwhat one would call an amenable tribe, at best. We need their history,\r\neven the little of it that the records must contain, for surely there\r\nmust be names and events in them of great value in our work of trying\r\nto bring these people to the surface and recivilize them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's to hinder our getting the records now?\" she asked\r\nseriously, with wonder in her gray and level gaze.\r\n\r\n\"_That_, for one thing!\"\r\n\r\nHe gestured at the Abyss.\r\n\r\n\"It's a good six or seven hundred miles wide, and we already know how\r\ndeep it is. I don't think we want to risk trying to cross it again and\r\nrunning out of fuel en route! Volplaning down to the village is\r\nquite a different proposition from a straight-away flight across!\"\r\n\r\nShe sat pensive a moment.\r\n\r\n\"There must be some way around,\" said she at last. \"Otherwise a party\r\nof survivors couldn't have set out for Storm King on the Hudson to\r\ndeposit a set of records there!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so, too. But--remember? 'Never returned.' I figure it this\r\nway: A party of the survivors probably started for New York,\r\nexploring. The big, concrete cathedral on Storm King--it was new in\r\n1916, you remember--was known the country over as the most massive\r\npiece of architecture this side of the pyramids. They must have\r\nplanned to leave one set of records there, in case the east, too, was\r\ndevastated. Well--\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose they succeeded?\"\r\n\r\n\"No telling. At any rate, there's a chance of it. And as for this\r\nRocky Mountain cache, that's manifestly out of the question, for now.\"\r\n\r\n\"So then?\" she queried eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"So then our job is to strike for Storm King. Incidentally we can\r\nrevisit Hope Villa, our bungalow on the banks of the Hudson. It's been\r\na year since we left it, almost--ten months, at any rate. Gad! What\r\nmarvels and miracles have happened since then, Beta--what perils, what\r\nescapes! Wouldn't you like to see our little nest again? We could rest\r\nup and plan and strengthen ourselves for the greater tasks ahead. And\r\nthen--\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, a change upon his face, his eyes lighting with a sudden\r\nglow. She saw and understood; and her breast rose with sudden keen\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n\"You mean,\" whispered she, \"in our own home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where better?\"\r\n\r\nShe paled as, kneeling beside her, he flung a powerful arm about her,\r\nand pulled her to him, breathing heavily.\r\n\r\n\"Don't! Don't!\" she forbade. \"No, no, Allan--there's so much work to\r\ndo--you mustn't!\"\r\n\r\nTo her a vision rose of dream-children--strong sons and daughters yet\r\nunborn. Their eyes seemed smiling, their fingers closing on hers.\r\nCloudlike, yet very real, they beckoned her, and in her stirred the\r\ncall of motherhood--of life to be. Her heart-strings echoed to that\r\nharmony; it seemed already as though a tiny head, downy--soft, was\r\nnestling in her bosom, while eager lips quested, quested.\r\n\r\n\"No, Allan! No!\"\r\n\r\nAlmost fiercely she flung him back and stood up.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" said she. \"Let us start at once. Nothing remains for us to do\r\nhere. Let us go--home!\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later the Pauillac spiralled far aloft, above the edge of the\r\nAbyss, then swept into its eastward tangent, and in swift, droning\r\nflight rushed toward the longed-for place of dreams, of rest, of love.\r\n\r\nBefore them stretched infinities of labor and tremendous struggle; but\r\nfor a little space they knew they now were free for this, the\r\nconsummation of their dreams, of all their hopes, their happiness,\r\ntheir joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCATASTROPHE!\r\n\r\n\r\nToward five o'clock next afternoon, from the swooping back of\r\nthe air-dragon they sighted a far blue ribbon winding among wooded\r\nheights, and knew Hudson once more lay before them.\r\n\r\nThe girl's heart leaped for joy at thought of once again seeing Hope\r\nVilla, the beach, the garden, the sun-dial--all the thousand and one\r\nlittle happy and pleasant things that, made by them in the heart of\r\nthe vast wilderness, had brought them such intimate and unforgetable\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\"There it is, Allan!\" cried she, pointing. \"There's the river again.\r\nWe'll soon be home now--home again!\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled and nodded, watchful at the wheel, and swung the biplane a\r\nlittle to southward, in the direction where he judged the bungalow\r\nmust lie.\r\n\r\nWeary they both were, yet full of life and strength. The trip from the\r\nchasm had been tedious, merely a long succession of hours in the\r\nrushing air, with unbroken forest, hills, lakes, rivers, and ever more\r\nforest steadily rolling away to westward like a vast carpet a thousand\r\nfeet below.\r\n\r\nNo sign of man, no life, no gap in nature's all-embracing sway. Even\r\nthe occasional heap of ruins marking the grave of some forgotten city\r\nserved only to intensify the old half-terror they had felt, when\r\nflying for the first time, at thought of the tremendous desolation of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe shining plain of Lake Erie had served the first day as a landmark\r\nto keep them true to their course.\r\n\r\nThat night they had stopped at the ruins of Buffalo, where they had\r\ncamped in the open, and where next morning Stern had fully replenished\r\nhis fuel-tanks with the usual supplies of alcohol from the debris of\r\ntwo or three large drug-stores.\r\n\r\nFrom Buffalo eastward, over almost the same course along which the\r\nhurricane of ten months ago had driven them, battling at random with\r\nthe gale, they steered by the compass. Toward mid-morning they saw a\r\nthin line of smoke arising in the far north, answered by still another\r\non the hills beyond, but to these signs they gave no heed.\r\n\r\nAlready they had seen and scorned them during their first stay at the\r\nbungalow. They felt that nothing more was to be seriously feared from\r\nsuch survivors of the Horde as had escaped the great Battle of the\r\nTower--a year and a half previously.\r\n\r\n\"Those chaps won't bother us again; I'm sure of that!\" said Allan,\r\nnodding toward the smoke-columns that rose, lazily blue, on the\r\nhorizon. \"The scare we threw into them in Madison Forest will last\r\nthem _one_ while!\"\r\n\r\nStill in this confident, defiant mood it was that they sighted the\r\nriver again and watched it rapidly broaden as the Pauillac, in a long\r\nseries of flat arcs, spurned the June air and whirled them onward\r\ntoward their goal.\r\n\r\nNearer the Hudson drew, and nearer still; and now its untroubled\r\nazure, calm save for a few cat's-paws of breeze that idled on the\r\nsurface, stretched almost beneath them in their rapid flight.\r\n\r\n\"We're still a little too far north, I see,\" the man judged, and swept\r\nthe biplane round to southward.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Newburgh lay presently upon their right. Soon after the\r\ncrumbled walls of West Point's pride slid past in silence, save for\r\nthe chatter of the engines, the whirling roar of the propeller-blades'\r\nvast energy.\r\n\r\nNo boat now vexed the flood. Upon its bosom neither steam nor sail now\r\nplowed a furrow. Along the banks no speeding train flung its\r\nsmoke-pennant to the wind. Primeval silence, universal calm, wrapped\r\nall things.\r\n\r\nBeatrice shuddered slightly. Now that they were nearing \"home\" the\r\ndesolation seemed more appalling.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Allan, is it possible all this will ever be peopled\r\nagain--_alive?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Certain to be! Once we get those records and begin transplanting the\r\nMerucaans, the rest will be only a matter of time!\"\r\n\r\nShe made no answer, but in her eyes shone pride that he could know\r\nsuch visions, have such faith.\r\n\r\nAlready they recognized the ruins of Nyack, and beyond them the point\r\nin the river behind which, they knew, lay Hope Villa, nestling in its\r\ngardens, its little sphere of cultivation hewn from the very heart of\r\nthe dense wilderness.\r\n\r\nAllan slackened speed, crossed to the eastern bank, and jockeyed for a\r\nsafe landing.\r\n\r\nThe point slipped backward and away. There, right ahead, they caught a\r\nglimpse of the long white beach where they had fished and bathed and\r\nbuilt their boat-house, and whence in their little yawl they had ten\r\nmonths before started on their trip of exploration--a trip destined to\r\nend so strangely in the Abyss.\r\n\r\n\"Home! Home!\" cried Beta, the quick tears starting to her lids. \"Oh,\r\nhome again!\"\r\n\r\nAlready the great plane was swooping downward toward the beach, hardly\r\na mile away, when a harsh shout escaped the man.\r\n\r\n\"Look! Canoes! My God--_what_--\"\r\n\r\nAs the drive of the Pauillac opened up the concave of the sand and\r\nbrought its whole length to view, Stern and the girl suddenly became\r\naware of trouble.\r\n\r\nThere, strung along the beach irregularly, they all at once made out\r\nten, twenty, thirty boats. Still afar, they could see these were the\r\nsame rough bancas such as they had seen after the battle--bancas in\r\none of which they two had escaped up-river!\r\n\r\n\"Boats! The Horde again!\"\r\n\r\nEven as he shouted a tiny, black, misshapen little figure ran\r\ncrouching out onto the sand. Another followed and a third, and now a\r\ndozen showed there, very distinct and hideous, upon the white\r\ncrescent.\r\n\r\nStern's heart went sick within him A terrible rage welled up--a hate\r\nsuch as he had never believed possible to feel.\r\n\r\nWild imprecations struggled to be voiced. He snapped his lips together\r\nin a thin line, his eyes narrowed, and his face went gray.\r\n\r\n\"The infernal little beasts!\" he gritted. \"Tried to trap us in the\r\ntower--cut our boat loose afterward--and now invading us! Don't know\r\nwhen they're licked, the swine!\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice had lost her color now. Milk-white her face was; her eyes\r\ngrew wide with terror; she strove to speak, but could not.\r\n\r\nHer hand went out in a wild, repelling gesture, as though by the very\r\npower of her love for home she could protect it now against the\r\nincursion of these foul, distorted, inhuman little monsters.\r\n\r\nStern acted quickly. He had been about to cut off power and coast for\r\nthe beach; but now he veered suddenly to eastward again, rotated the\r\nrising-plane, and brought the Pauillac up at a sharp tilt. Banking, he\r\nadvanced the spark a notch; the engine shrilled a half-tone higher,\r\nand with increased speed the aero lifted them bravely in a long and\r\nrising swoop.\r\n\r\nHe snatched his automatic from its holster on his hip and as the plane\r\nswept past the beach, down-stream, let fly a spatter of steel jacketed\r\nsouvenirs at the fast-thickening pack on the sand.\r\n\r\nFar up to the girl and him, half heard through the clatter of the\r\nmotors, they sensed a thin, defiant, barbarous yell--a yapping chorus,\r\nbestial and horrible.\r\n\r\nAgain Stern fired.\r\n\r\nHe could see quick spurts of water jet up along the edge of the sand,\r\nand one of the creatures fell, but this was only a chance shot.\r\n\r\nAt that distance, firing from a swift-skimming plane, he knew he could\r\ndo no execution, and with a curse slid the pistol back again into its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for a dirigible and a few Pulverite bombs, same as we had in the\r\ntower!\" he wished. \"I'd clean the blighters out mighty quick!\"\r\n\r\nBut now Beatrice was pointing, with a cry of dismay, down, away at the\r\nbungalow itself, which had for a moment become visible at the far end\r\nof the clearing as the Pauillac scudded past.\r\n\r\nEven as Stern thought: \"Odd, but they're not afraid of us--a\r\nflying-machine means nothing to them, does not terrify them as it\r\nwould human savages. They're too debased even to feel fear!\"--even as\r\nthis thought crossed his brain he, too, saw the terrible thing that\r\nthe girl had cried out at sight of.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" he shouted. \"This--this is too much!\"\r\n\r\nAll about the bungalow, their home, the scene of such happy hours, so\r\nmany dreams and hopes, such heart-enthralling labors, hundreds of the\r\nHorde were swarming.\r\n\r\nLike vicious parasites attacking prey, they overran the garden, the\r\ngrounds, even the house itself.\r\n\r\nAs in a flash, Stern knew all his work of months must be undone--the\r\nfruit-trees he had rescued from the forest be cut down or broken, the\r\nbulbs and roots in the garden uptorn, even the hedges and fences\r\ntrampled flat.\r\n\r\nWorse still, the bungalow was being destroyed! Rather, its contents,\r\nsince the concrete walls defied the venomous troop.\r\n\r\nThey knew, at any rate, the use of fire, and not so swiftly skimmed\r\nthe Pauillac as to prevent both Stern and Beatrice seeing a thin but\r\nominous thread of smoke out-curling on the June air from one of the\r\nliving-room windows.\r\n\r\nWith an imprecation of unutterable hate and rage, yet impotent to stay\r\nthe ravishment of Hope Villa, Stern brought the machine round in a\r\nlong spiral.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the wild, suicidal idea possessed him to land on the\r\nbeach, after all, and charge the little slate-blue devils who had\r\nevidently piled all the furnishings together in the bungalow and were\r\nnow burning them.\r\n\r\nHe longed for slaughter now; he lusted blood--the blood of the\r\nAnthropoid pack which from the beginning had hung upon his flank and\r\nbeen as a thorn unto his flesh.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to feel the joy of rushing them, an automatic in each hand\r\nspitting death, just as he had mown down the Lanskaarn in the Battle\r\nof the Wall, down below in the Abyss. Even though he knew the\r\ninevitable ends poisoned spear-thrust, a wound with one of those\r\nterribly envenomed arrows--he felt no fear.\r\n\r\nRevenge! If he could only feel its sweetness, death had no terrors.\r\n\r\nCommon sense instantly sobered him and dispelled these vain ideas. The\r\nbungalow, after all, was not vital to his future or the girl's.\r\nBarring the set of encyclopedias on metal plates, everything else\r\ncould be replaced with sufficient labor. Only a madman would risk a\r\nfight with such a Horde in company with a woman.\r\n\r\nNot now were he and Beatrice entrenched in a strong tower, with\r\nterrible explosives. Now they were in the open, armed only with\r\nrevolvers. For the present there was no redress.\r\n\r\n\"Beta,\" cried he, \"we're up against it this time for fair--and we\r\ncan't hit back!\"\r\n\r\n\"Our bungalow! Our precious home!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know.\" He saw that she was crying: \"It's a rotten shame and all\r\nthat, but it isn't fatal.\"\r\n\r\nHe brought the Pauillac down-wind again, coasting high over the\r\nbungalow, whence smoke now issued ever more and more thickly.\r\n\r\n\"We're simply hamstrung this time, that's all. Where those devils have\r\ncome from and how many there may be, God knows. Thousands, perhaps;\r\nthe woods may be full of em. It's lucky for us they didn't attack\r\nwhile we were there!\r\n\r\n\"Now--well, the only thing to do is let 'em have their way for the\r\npresent. Eventually--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, can't we _ever_ get rid of the horrid little beasts for good?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can and will!\" He spoke very grimly, soaring the machine still\r\nhigher over the river and once more coming round above the upper end\r\nof the beach. \"One of these days there's got to be a final reckoning,\r\nbut not yet!\"\r\n\r\n\"So it's good-by to Hope Villa, Allan? There's no way?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's good-by. Humanly speaking, none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we land, blockade ourselves in the boat-house, and--\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes sparkled with the boldness of the plan--its peril, its\r\npossibilities. But Allan only shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"And expose the Pauillac on the beach?\" he asked. \"One good swing with\r\na war-club into the motor and then a week's siege and slow starvation,\r\nwith a final rush--interesting, but not practical, little girl. No,\r\nno; the better part of valor is to recognize force majeure and\r\n_wait!_ Remember what we've said already? 'Je recule pour mieux\r\nsauter?' Wait till we get a fresh start on these hell-hounds; we'll\r\njump 'em far enough!\"\r\n\r\nThe bungalow now lay behind. The whole clearing seemed alive with the\r\nlittle blue demons, like vermin crawling everywhere. Thicker and\r\nthicker now the smoke was pouring upward. The scene was one of utter\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly it faded. The plane had borne its riders onward and away\r\nfrom the range of vision. Again only dense forest lay below, while to\r\neastward sparkled the broad reach where, in the first days of their\r\nhappiness at Hope Villa, the girl and Allan had fished and bathed.\r\n\r\nHer tears were unrestrained at last; but Allan, steadying the wheel\r\nwith one hand, drew an arm about her and kissed and comforted her.\r\n\r\n\"There, there, little girl! The world's not ended yet, even if they\r\n_have_ burned up our home-made mission furniture! Come, Beatrice, no\r\ntears--we've other things to think of now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where away, since our home's gone?\" she queried pitifully.\r\n\r\n\"Where away? Why, Storm King, of course! And the cathedral and the\r\nrecords, and--_and_--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\"TO-MORROW IS OUR WEDDING-DAY\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPurple and gold the light of that dying day still glowed across\r\nthe western sky when the stanch old Pauillac, heated yet throbbing\r\nwith power, skimmed the last league and swung the last great bend of\r\nthe river that hid old Storm King from the wanderers' eager sight.\r\n\r\nStern's eyes brightened at vision of that vast, rugged headland,\r\nforest-clad and superb in the approaching twilight. Beatrice, weary\r\nnow and spent--for the long journeys, the excitements and griefs of\r\nthe day had worn her down despite her strength--paled a little and\r\ngrew pensive as the massive structure of the cathedral loomed against\r\nthe sky-line.\r\n\r\nWhat thoughts were hers now that the goal lay near--what longings,\r\nfears and hopes, what exultation and what pain? She shivered slightly;\r\nbut perhaps the evening coolness at that height had pierced her cloak.\r\nHer hands clasped tightly, she tried to smile but could not.\r\n\r\nAllan could notice nothing of all this. His gaze was anxiously bent on\r\nthe earth below, to find a landing for the great machine. He skimmed\r\nthe broad brow of the mountain, hardly a hundred feet above the spires\r\nof the massive concrete pile that still reared itself steadfastly upon\r\nthe height facing the east.\r\n\r\nAll about it the dense unbroken forest spread impenetrable to the eye.\r\nBelow the bold breast of the cliff a narrow strip of beach appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Hard job to land, that's one sure thing!\" exclaimed the man, peering\r\nat the inhospitable contours of the land. \"No show to make it on top\r\nof the mountain, and if we take the beach it means a most tremendous\r\nclimb up the cliff or through the forest on the flank. Here _is_ a\r\nsituation, Beatrice! Now--ah--see there? Look! that barren ridge to\r\nwestward!\"\r\n\r\nHalf a mile back from the river on the western slope of the highlands,\r\na spur of Storm King stretched water-worn and bare, a sandy spit\r\ndotted only sparsely with scrub-pine.\r\n\r\n\"It's that, or nothing!\" cried the man, banking in a wide sweep.\r\n\r\n\"Can you make it? Even the clearest space at this end is terribly\r\nshort!\"\r\n\r\nAllan laughed and cut off power. In the old days not for ten thousand\r\ndollars would he have tried so ticklish a descent, but now his mettle\r\nwas of sterner stuff and his skill with the machine developed to a\r\npoint where man and biplane seemed almost one organism.\r\n\r\nWith a swift rush the Pauillac coasted down. He checked her at\r\nprecisely the right moment, as the sand seemed whirling up to meet\r\nthem, swerved to dodge a fire-blasted trunk, and with a shout took the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe plane bounced, creaked, skidded on the long runners he had fitted\r\nto her, and with a lurch came to rest not ten yards from an ugly stump\r\ndead ahead.\r\n\r\n\"Made it, by Heaven!\" he exulted. \"But a few feet more and it wouldn't\r\nhave been--well, no matter. We're here, anyhow. Now, supper and a good\r\nsleep. And to-morrow, the cathedral!\"\r\n\r\nHe helped the girl alight, for she was cramped and stiff. Presently\r\ntheir camp-fire cheered the down-drawing gloom, as so many other times\r\nin such strange places. And before long their evening meal was in\r\ncourse of preparation, close by a great glacial boulder at the edge of\r\nthe sand-barren.\r\n\r\nIn good comradeship they ate, then wheeled the biplane over to the\r\nrock, and under the shelter of its wide-spreading wings made their\r\ncamp for the night. An hour or so they sat talking of many\r\nthings--their escape from the Abyss, the patriarch's death, their trip\r\neast again, the loss of their little home, their plans, their hopes,\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\nBeatrice seemed to grieve more than Stern over the destruction of the\r\nbungalow. So much of her woman's heart had gone into the making of\r\nthat nest, so many thoughts had centered on a return to it once more,\r\nthat now when it lay in ruins through the spiteful mischief of the\r\nHorde, she found sorrow knocking insistently at the gates of her soul.\r\nBut Allan comforted her as best he might.\r\n\r\n\"Never you mind, little girl!\" said he bravely. \"It's only an\r\nincident, after all. A year from now another and a still more\r\nbeautiful home will shelter us in some more secure location. And\r\nthere'll be human companionship, too, about us. In a year many of the\r\nFolk will have been brought from the depths. In a year miracles may\r\nhappen--even the greatest one of all!\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes met his a moment by the ruddy fire-glow and held true.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered she, \"even the greatest in the world!\"\r\n\r\nA sudden tenderness swept over him at thought of all that had been and\r\nwas still to be, at sight of this woman's well-loved face irradiated\r\nby the leaping blaze--her face now just a little wan with long\r\nfatigues and sad as though with realization, with some compelling\r\ninner sense of vast, impending responsibilities.\r\n\r\nHe gathered her in his strong arms, he drew her yielding body close,\r\nand kissed her very gently.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow!\" he whispered. \"Do you realize it?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow,\" she made answer, her breath mingling with his.\r\n\"To-morrow, Allan--one page of life forever closed, another opened.\r\nOh, may it be for good--may we be very strong and very wise!\"\r\n\r\nNeither spoke for the space of a few heart-beats, while the wind made\r\na vague, melancholy music in the sentinel tree-tops and the snapping\r\nsparks danced upward by the rock.\r\n\r\n\"Life, all life--just dancing sparks--then gone!\" said Beatrice\r\nslowly. \"And yet--yet it is good to have lived, Allan. Good to have\r\nlighted the black mystery of the universe, formless and endless and\r\ninscrutable, by even so brief a flicker!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it my little pessimist to-night?\" he asked. \"Too tired, that's\r\nall. In the morning things will look different. You must smile, then,\r\nBeta, and not think of formless mystery or--or anything sad at all.\r\nFor to-morrow is our wedding-day.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt her catch her breath and tremble just a bit.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know. Our wedding-day, Allan. Surely the strangest since time\r\nbegan. No friends, no gifts, no witnesses, no minister, no--\"\r\n\r\n\"There, there!\" he interrupted, smiling. \"How can my little girl be so\r\nwrong-headed? Friends? Why, everything's our friend! All nature is our\r\nfriend--the whole life-process is our friend and ally! Gifts? What\r\nneed have we of gifts? Aren't you my gift, surely the best gift that a\r\nman ever had since the beginning of all things? Am I not yours?\r\n\r\n\"Minister? Priest? We need none! The world-to-be shall have got far\r\naway from such, far beyond its fairy-tale stage, its weaknesses and\r\nfears of the Unknown, which alone explain their existence. Here on\r\nStorm King, under the arches of the old cathedral our clasped hands,\r\nour--mutual words of love and trust and honor--these shall suffice.\r\nThe river and the winds and forest, the sunlight and the sky, the\r\nwhole infinite expanse of Nature herself shall be our priest and\r\nwitnesses. And never has a wedding been so true, so solemn and so holy\r\nas yours and mine shall be. For you are mine, my Beatrice, and I am\r\nyours--forever!\"\r\n\r\nA little silence, while the flames leaped higher and the shadows\r\ndeepened in the dim aisles of the fir-forest all about them. In the\r\nvast canopy of evening sky clustering star-points had begun to\r\nshimmer.\r\n\r\nRedly the camp-fire lighted man and woman there alone together in the\r\nwild. For them there was no sense of isolation nor any loneliness. She\r\nwas his world now, and he hers.\r\n\r\nUp into his eyes she looked fairly and bravely, and her full lips\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, Allan!\" she whispered. \"It was only a mood, that's all.\r\nIt's passed now--it won't come back. Only forgive me, boy!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, brave girl!\" he murmured, smoothing the thick hair back from\r\nher brow. \"Never complaining, never repining, never afraid!\"\r\n\r\nTheir lips met again and for a time the girl's heart throbbed on his.\r\n\r\nAfar a wolf's weird, tremulous call drifted down-wind. An owl,\r\ndisturbed in its nocturnal quest, hooted upon the slope above to\r\neastward; and across the darkening sky reeled an unsteady bat, far\r\nlarger than in the old days when there were cities on the earth and\r\nships upon the sea.\r\n\r\nThe fire burned low. Allan arose and flung fresh wood upon it, while\r\nsheaves of winking light gyrated upward through the air. Then he\r\nreturned to Beatrice and wrapped her in his cloak.\r\n\r\nAnd for a long, long time they both talked of many things--intimate,\r\nsolemn, wondrous things--together in the night.\r\n\r\nAnd the morrow was to be their wedding-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE SEARCH FOR THE RECORDS\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning found them early astir, to greet the glory of June\r\nsunlight over the shoulder of Storm King. A perfect morning, if ever\r\nany one was perfect since the world began--soft airs stirring in the\r\nforest, golden robins' full-throated song, the melody of the scarlet\r\ntropic birds they had named \"fire-birds\" for want of any more\r\ndescriptive title, the chatter of gray squirrels on the branches\r\noverhead, all blent, under a sky of wondrous azure, to tell them of\r\nlife, full and abundant, joyous and kind.\r\n\r\nTwo of the squirrels had to die, for breakfast, which Beta cooked\r\nwhile Allan quested the edges of the wood for the ever-present\r\nberries. They drank from a fern-embowered spring a hundred yards or so\r\nto south of their camp in the forest, and felt the vigorous tides of\r\nlife throb hotly through their splendid bodies.\r\n\r\nAllan got together the few simple implements at their disposal for the\r\nexpedition--his ax, a torch made of the brown weed of the Abyss,\r\noil-soaked and bound with wire that fastened it to a metal handle, and\r\na skin bag of the rude matches he had manufactured in the village of\r\nthe Folk.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, en marche!\" said he at length. \"The old cathedral and the\r\nrecords are awaiting a morning call from us--and there are all the\r\nwedding preparations to make as well. We've got no time to lose!\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed happily with a blush and gave him her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Lead on, Sir Knight!\" she jested. \"I'm yours by right of capture and\r\nconquest, as in the good old days!\"\r\n\r\n\"The good new days will have better and higher standards,\" he answered\r\ngravely. \"To-day, one age is closed, another opened for all time.\"\r\n\r\nHand in hand they ascended the barren spur to eastward, and presently\r\nreached the outposts of the forest that rose in close-ranked majesty\r\nover the brow of Storm King.\r\n\r\nThe going proved hard, for with the warmer climate that now favored\r\nthe country, undergrowth had sprung up far more luxuriantly than in\r\nthe days of the old-time civilization; but Stern and Beatrice were\r\nused to labor, and together--he ahead to break or cut a path--they\r\nstruggled through the wood.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour's climb brought them to their first dim sight of the\r\nmassive towers of the cathedral, rising beyond the tangle of trees,\r\nmajestic in the morning sun.\r\n\r\nSoon after they had made their way close up to the huge,\r\nlichen-crusted walls, and in the shadow of the gigantic pile slowly\r\nexplored round to the vast portals facing eastward over the Hudson.\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful work, magnificent proportions and design,\" Stern commented,\r\nas they stopped at last on the broad, debris-littered steps and drew\r\nbreath. \"Brick and stone have long since perished. Even steel has\r\ncrumbled. But concrete seems eternal. Why, the building's practically\r\nintact even to-day, after ten centuries of absolute abandonment. A\r\nweek's work with a force of men would quite restore it. The damage\r\nit's suffered is absolutely insignificant. Concrete. A lesson to be\r\nlearned, is it not, in our rebuilding of the world?\"\r\n\r\nThe mighty temple stood, in fact, almost as men had left it in the\r\nlong ago, when the breath of annihilation had swept a withering blast\r\nover the face of the earth. The broad grounds and driveways that had\r\nled up to the entrance had, of course, long since absolutely vanished\r\nunder rank growths.\r\n\r\nGrass flourished in the gutters and on the Gothic finials; the\r\ngargoyles were bearded with vines and fern-clusters; the flying\r\nbuttresses and mullions stood green with moss; and in the vegetable\r\nmold that had for centuries accumulated on the steps and in the\r\nvestibule--for the oaken doors had crumbled to powder--many a\r\nbright-flowered plant raised its blossoms to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe tall memorial windows and the great rose-window in the eastern\r\nfacade had long since been shattered out of their frames by hail and\r\ntempest. But the main body of the cathedral seemed yet as massively\r\nintact as when the master-builders of the twentieth century had taken\r\ndown the last scaffold, and when the gigantic organ had first pealed\r\nits \"Laus Deo\" through the vaulted apse.\r\n\r\nTogether they entered the vast silent space, and--awed despite\r\nthemselves--gazed in wonder at the beauties of this, the most\r\nmagnificent temple ever built in the western hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe marble floor was covered now with windrows of dead leaves and\r\npine-spills, and with the litter from myriads of birds'-nests that\r\nsheltered themselves on achitraves and galleries, and on the lofty\r\ncapitals of the fluted pillars which rose, vistalike, a hundred feet\r\nabove the clear-story, spraying out into a wondrous complexity of ribs\r\nto sustain the marvelous concrete vaultings full two hundred feet in\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThrough the shattered windows broad slants of sunshine fell athwart\r\nthe walls and floor. Swallows chirped and twittered far aloft, or\r\nwinged their swift way through the dusky upper spaces, passing at will\r\nin or out the mullioned gaps whence all the painted glass had long\r\nsince fallen.\r\n\r\nAn air of mystery, of long expectancy seemed brooding everywhere; it\r\nseemed almost as though the spirit of the past were waiting to receive\r\nthem--waiting now, as it had waited a thousand years, patiently,\r\ninexorably, untiringly for those to come who should some day reclaim\r\nthe hidden secrets in the crypt, once more awaken human echoes in the\r\nvault, and so redeem the world. \"Waiting!\" breathed Stern, as if the\r\nthought hung pregnant in the very air. \"Waiting all these long\r\ncenturies--for _us!_ For you, Beatrice, for me! And we are here, at\r\nlast, we of the newer time; and here we shall be one. The symbol of\r\nthe pillars, mounting, ever mounting toward the infinite, the hope of\r\nlife eternal, the majesty and mystery of this great temple, welcome\r\nus! Come!\"\r\n\r\nHe took her hand again and now in silence they walked forward\r\nnoiselessly over the thick leaf-carpet on the pavement of rare marble.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Allan, I feel so very small in here!\" she whispered, drawing\r\nclose to him. \"You and I, all alone in this tremendous place built for\r\nthousands--\"\r\n\r\n\"You and I are _the world_ to-day!\" he answered very gravely; and so\r\ntogether they made way toward the vast transept, arched with a\r\nbewildering lacery of vaultings.\r\n\r\nAll save the concrete had long vanished. No traces now remained of\r\npews, or railings, altars, pulpits, or any of the fittings of the vast\r\ncathedral.\r\n\r\nMajestic in its naked strength, the building stood in light and\r\nshadow, here banded with strong sun, there lost in cool purple shade\r\nthat foiled the eye far up among the hanging miracles of the roof.\r\n\r\nAt the transept-crossing they stood amazed; for here the flutings ran\r\nup five hundred feet inside the stupendous central spire, among a\r\nmarvelous filigree of windows which diminished toward the top--a\r\nlacework as of frost-patterns etched into the solid substance of the\r\nfleche.\r\n\r\n\"Higher than that, more massive and more beautiful the buildings of\r\nthe future shall arise,\" said Allan slowly after a pause. \"But they\r\nshall not serve creed or faction. They shall be for all mankind, for\r\nthe great race still to come. Beauty shall be its heritage, its right.\r\n\r\n  \"'And loveliness shall crown the waiting world\r\n   As with a garland of immortal joy!'\r\n\r\n\"But come, come, Beatrice--there's work to do. The records, girl! We\r\nmustn't stand here admiring architecture and dreaming dreams while\r\nthose records are still undiscovered. Down into the crypt we go, to\r\ndig among the relics of a vanished age!\"\r\n\r\n\"The crypt, Allan? Where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I remember rightly--and at the time this cathedral was built I\r\nfollowed the plans with some care--the entrance is back of the main\r\nsouthern cluster of pillars over there at the transept-crossing. Come\r\non, Beta. In a minute we can see whether thousand-year-old memories\r\nare any good or not!\"\r\n\r\nQuickly he led the way, ax and torch in hand, and as they rounded the\r\ngroup of massive buttresses whence sprang the pillars for the\r\ngroin-vaults aloft, a cry of satisfaction escaped him, followed by a\r\nword of quick astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Allan?\" exclaimed the girl. \"Anything wrong? Or--\"\r\n\r\nThe man stood peering with wide eyes; then suddenly he knelt and began\r\npawing over the little heap of vegetable drift that had accumulated\r\nalong the wall.\r\n\r\n\"It's here, all right,\" said he. \"There's the door, right in front of\r\nus--but what I don't understand is--_this!_\"\r\n\r\n\"What, Allan? Is there anything wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not wrong, perhaps, but devilish peculiar!\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking, he raised his hand to her. The fingers held an arrow-head of\r\nflint.\r\n\r\n\"There's been a battle here, that's sure,\" said he. \"Look,\r\nspear-points--shattered!\"\r\n\r\nHe had already uncovered three obsidian blades. The broken tips proved\r\nhow forcibly they had been driven against the stone in the long ago.\r\n\r\n\"What? A--\"\r\n\r\nHis fingers closed on a small, hollow shell of gold.\r\n\r\n\"A molar, so help me! All that's left of some forgotten white man who\r\nfell here, at the door, a thousand years ago!\"\r\n\r\nSpeechless, the girl took the shell from him and examined it.\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Allan,\" she answered. \"This certainly is a hollow gold\r\ncrown. Any one can see _that_, in spite of the patina that's formed\r\nover the metal. Why--what can it all mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Search _me!_ The patriarch's record gave the impression that this\r\neastern expedition set out within thirty years or so of the\r\ncatastrophe. Well, in that short time it doesn't seem possible there\r\ncould have developed savages fighting with flints and so on. But that\r\nthere certainly was a battle here at this door, and that the cathedral\r\nwas used as a fort against some kind of invasion is positively\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\n\"Why, look at the chips of concrete knocked off the jamb of the door\r\nhere! Must have been some tall mace-work where you're standing, Beta!\r\nIf we could know the complete story of this expedition, its probable\r\nfailure to reach New York, its entrapment here, the siege and the\r\ninevitable tragedy of its end--starvation, sorties, repulses,\r\nhand-to-hand fighting at the outer gates, in the nave, here at the\r\ncrypt door, perhaps on the stairs and in the vaults below--then defeat\r\nand slaughter and extinction--what a tremendous drama we could\r\nformulate!\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice nodded. Plain to see, the thought depressed her.\r\n\r\n\"Death, everywhere--\" she began, but Allan laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Life, you mean!\" he rallied. \"Come, now, this does no good, poking in\r\nthe rubbish of a distant tragedy. Real work awaits us. Come!\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up the torch, and with his primitive but serviceable matches\r\nlighted it. The smoke rose through the silent air of the cathedral, up\r\ninto a broad sunlit zone from a tall window in the transept, where it\r\nwrithed blue and luminous.\r\n\r\nA single blow of Allan's ax shattered the last few shreds of oaken\r\nplank that still hung from the eroded hinges of the door. In front of\r\nthe explorers a flight of concrete steps descended, winding darkly to\r\nthe crypt beneath.\r\n\r\nAllan went first, holding the torch high to light the way.\r\n\r\n\"The records!\" he exclaimed. \"Soon, soon we shall know the secrets of\r\nthe past!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTRAPPED!\r\n\r\n\r\nSome thirty steps the way descended, ending in a straight and\r\nvery narrow passage. The air, though somewhat chill, was absolutely\r\ndry and perfectly respirable, thanks to the enormously massive\r\nfoundation of solid concrete which formed practically one solid\r\nmonolith six hundred feet long by two hundred and fifty broad--a\r\nmonolith molded about the crypt and absolutely protecting it from\r\nevery outside influence.\r\n\r\n\"Not even the Great Pyramid of Ghizeh could afford a more\r\nperfect--hello, what's _this?_\"\r\n\r\nAllan stopped short, staring downward at the floor. His voice reechoed\r\nstrangely in the restricted space.\r\n\r\n\"A skeleton, so help me!\"\r\n\r\nTrue indeed. At one side of the passage, lying in a position that\r\nstrongly suggested death in a crouching, despairing attitude--death by\r\nstarvation rather than by violence--a little clutter of human bones\r\ngleamed white under the torch-flare.\r\n\r\n\"A skeleton--the first one of our vanished race we've ever found!\"\r\nexclaimed the man. \"All the remains in New York, you remember, down in\r\nthe subway or in any of the buildings, were invariably little piles of\r\nimpalpable dust mixed with coins and bits of rusted metal. But\r\nthis--it's absolutely intact!\"\r\n\r\n\"The dry air and all--\" suggested Beatrice.\r\n\r\nStern nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"Intact, so far. But--\"\r\n\r\nHe stirred the skull with his foot. Instantly it vanished into powder.\r\n\r\n\"Just as I thought,\" said he. \"No chance to give a decent burial to\r\nthis or any other human remains we may come across here. The slightest\r\ndisturbance totally disintegrates them. But with _this_ it's\r\ndifferent!\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up a revolver, hardly rusted at all, that lay near at hand.\r\n\r\n\"Cartridges; look!\" cried Beatrice, pointing.\r\n\r\n\"That's so, too--a score or more!\"\r\n\r\nLying in an irregular oval that plainly told of a vanished\r\ncartridge-belt, a string of cartridges trailed on the concrete floor.\r\n\r\n\"H-m-m-m! Just for an experiment, let's see!\" murmured the engineer.\r\n\r\nAlready he had slipped in a charge.\r\n\r\n\"Steady, Beatrice!\" he cautioned, and, pointing down the passage,\r\npulled trigger.\r\n\r\nFlame stabbed the half-dark and the crashing detonation rang in their\r\nears.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of _that?_\" cried Stern exultantly. \"Talk about\r\nyour miracles! A thousand years and--\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice grasped him by the arm and pointed downward. Astonished, he\r\nstared. The rest of the skeleton had vanished. In its place now only a\r\nfew handfuls of dust lay on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be--\" the man exclaimed. \"Even _that_ does the trick, eh?\r\nH-m! It would be a joke, now, wouldn't it, if the records should act\r\nthe same way? Come on, Beta; this is all very interesting, but it\r\nisn't getting us anywhere. We've got to be at work!\"\r\n\r\nHe pocketed the new-found gun and cartridges and once more, torch on\r\nhigh, started down the passage, with the girl at his side.\r\n\r\n\"See here, Allan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the wall here--a painted stripe?\"\r\n\r\nHe held the torch close and scrutinized the mark.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like it. Pretty well gone by now--just a flake here and a daub\r\nthere, but I guess it once was a broad band of white. A guide?\"\r\n\r\nThey moved forward again. The strip ended in a blur that might once\r\nhave been an inscription. Here, there, a letter faintly showed, but\r\nnot one word could now be made out.\r\n\r\n\"Too bad,\" he mused. \"It must have been mighty important or they\r\nwouldn't have--\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's a door, Allan!\"\r\n\r\n\"So? That's right. Now this looks like business at last!\"\r\n\r\nHe examined the door by the unsteady flicker of the torch. It was of\r\niron, still intact, and fastened by a long iron bar dropped into\r\nmassive metal staples.\r\n\r\n\"Beat it in with the ax?\" she queried.\r\n\r\n\"No. The concussion might reduce everything inside to dust. Ah! Here's\r\na padlock and a chain!\"\r\n\r\nCarefully he studied the chain beneath bent brows.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Beta, you hold the torch, so. That's right. Now then--\"\r\n\r\nAlready he had set the ax-blade between the padlock and the staple. A\r\nquick jerk--the lock flew open raspingly. Allan tried to lift the bar,\r\nbut it resisted.\r\n\r\nA tap of the ax and it gave, swinging upward on a pivot. Then a minute\r\nlater the door swung inward, yielding to his vigorous push.\r\n\r\nTogether they entered the crypt of solid concrete, a chamber forty\r\nfeet long by half as wide and vaulted overhead with arches, crowning\r\nperhaps twenty feet from the floor.\r\n\r\n\"More skeletons, so help me!\"\r\n\r\nAllan pointed at two more on the pavement at the left of the entrance.\r\n\r\n\"Why--how could _that_ happen?\" queried Beta, puzzled. \"The door was\r\nlocked outside!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so. Either there must be some other exit from this place or\r\nthere were dissensions and fightings among the party itself. Or these\r\nmen were wounded and were locked in here for safe-keeping while the\r\nothers made a sortie and never got back, or--_I_ don't know! Frankly,\r\nit's too much for me. If I were a story-writer I might figure it out,\r\nbut I'm not. No matter, they're here, anyhow; that's all. Here two of\r\nour own people died ten centuries ago, trying to preserve civilization\r\nand the world's history for future ages, if there were to be any such.\r\nTwo martyrs. I salute them!\"\r\n\r\nIn silence and awed sympathy they inspected the mournful relics of\r\nhumanity a minute, but took good care not to touch them.\r\n\r\n\"And now the records!\"\r\n\r\nEven as Stern spoke he saw again a dimly painted line, this time upon\r\nthe floor, all but invisible beneath the dust of centuries that had\r\ncome from God knows where.\r\n\r\n\"Come, let's follow the line!\" cried he.\r\n\r\nIt led them straight through the middle of the crypt and to a sort of\r\ntunnel-like vault at the far end. This they entered quickly and almost\r\nat once knew they had reached the goal of their long quest.\r\n\r\nIn front of them, about seven feet from the floor, a rough white star\r\nhad been smeared. Directly below it a kind of alcove or recess\r\nappeared, lined with shelves of concrete. What its original purpose\r\nmay have been it would be hard to say; perhaps it may have been\r\nintended as a storage-place for the cathedral archives.\r\n\r\nBut now the explorers saw it was partly filled with pile on pile of\r\ncuriously crinkled parchment not protected in any way from the air,\r\nnot covered or boxed in. To the right, however, stood a massive chest,\r\nseemingly of sheet-lead.\r\n\r\n\"Some sense to the lead,\" growled Stern; \"but why they left their\r\nrecords open to the air, blest if I can see!\"\r\n\r\nHe raised the torch and flared the light along the shelves, and then\r\nhe understood. For here, there, copper nails glinted dully, lying in\r\ndust that once upon a time had been wood.\r\n\r\n\"I'm wrong, Beta; I apologize to them,\" Stern exclaimed. \"These were\r\nall securely boxed once, but the boxes have gone to pieces long since.\r\nDry-rot, you know. Well, let's see what condition the parchments are\r\nin!\"\r\n\r\nShe held the torch while he tried to raise one, but it broke at the\r\nslightest touch. Again he assayed, and a third time. Same result.\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott!\" he ejaculated, nonplused. \"See what we're up against,\r\nwill you? We've found 'em and they're ours, but--\"\r\n\r\nThey stood considering a minute. All at once a dull metallic clang\r\nechoed heavily through the crypt. Despite herself, the girl shuddered.\r\nThe eerie depths, the gloom, the skeletons had all conspired to shake\r\nher nerves.\r\n\r\n\"What's _that?_\" she whispered, gripping Allan by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"That? Oh--nothing! Now _how_ the deuce are we going to get at\r\nthese--\"\r\n\r\n\"It _was_ something, Allan! But what?\"\r\n\r\nHe grew suddenly silent.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove--it sounded like--the door--\"\r\n\r\n\"The door? Oh, Allan, quick!\"\r\n\r\nA sudden, irresistible fear fingered at the strings of the man's\r\nheart. At the back of his neck he felt the hair begin to lift. Then he\r\nsmiled by very strength of will.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be absurd, Beatrice,\" he managed to say. \"It couldn't be, of\r\ncourse. There's no one here. It--\"\r\n\r\nBut already she was out of the alcove. With the torch held high in\r\nair, she stood there peering with wide eyes down the long blackness of\r\nthe crypt, striving to pierce the dark.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he heard her cry of terror.\r\n\r\n\"The door, Allan! The door! _It's shut!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE LEADEN CHEST\r\n\r\n\r\nNot at any time since the girl and he had wakened in the tower,\r\nmore than a year ago, had Allan felt so compelling a fear as overswept\r\nhim then. The siege of the Horde at Madison Forest, the plunge down\r\nthe cataract, the fall into the Abyss and the battle with the\r\nLanskaarn had all taxed his courage to the utmost, but he had met\r\nthese perils with more calm than he now faced the blank menace of that\r\nmetal door.\r\n\r\nFor now no sky overhung him, no human agency opposed him, no\r\ncounterplay of stress and strife thrilled his blood.\r\n\r\nNo; the girl and he now were far underground in a crypt, a tomb,\r\nwalled round with incalculable tons of concrete, barred from the upper\r\nworld, alone--and for the first time in his life the man knew\r\nsomething of the anguish of unreasoning fear.\r\n\r\nYet he was not bereft of powers of action. Only an instant he stood\r\nthere motionless and staring; then with a cry, wordless and harsh, he\r\nran toward the barrier.\r\n\r\nBeneath his spurning feet the friable skeletons crumbled and vanished;\r\nhe dashed himself against the door with a curse that was half a\r\nprayer; he strove with it--and staggered back, livid and shaken, for\r\nit held!\r\n\r\nNow Beatrice had reached it, too. In her hand the torch trembled and\r\nshook. She tried to speak, but could not. And as he faced her, there\r\nin the tomblike vault, their eyes met silently.\r\n\r\nA deathly stillness fell, with but their heart-beats and the\r\nsputtering of the torch to deepen it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she gasped, stretching out a hand. \"You--we--_can't_--\"\r\n\r\nHe licked his lips and tried to smile, but failed.\r\n\r\n\"Don't--don't be afraid, little girl!\" he stammered. \"This can't hold\r\nus, possibly. The chain--I broke it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but the bar, Allan--the bar! How did you leave the bar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Raised!\"\r\n\r\nThe one word seemed to seal their doom. A shudder passed through\r\nBeatrice.\r\n\r\n\"So then,\" she choked, \"some air-current swung the door shut--and the\r\nbar--fell--\"\r\n\r\nA sudden rage possessed the engineer.\r\n\r\n\"Damn that infernal staple!\" he gritted, and as he spoke the ax swung\r\ninto air.\r\n\r\n\"Crash!\"\r\n\r\nOn the metal plates it boomed and echoed thunderously. A ringing\r\nclangor vibrated the crypt.\r\n\r\n\"_Crash!_\"\r\n\r\nDid the door start? No; but in the long-eroded plates a jagged dent\r\ntook form.\r\n\r\nAgain the ax swung high. Cold though the vault was, sweat globuled his\r\nforehead, where the veins had swelled to twisting knots.\r\n\r\n\"_Crash!_\"\r\n\r\nWith a wild verberation, a scream of sundered metal and a clatter of\r\nflying fragments, the staple gave way. A crack showed round the edge\r\nof the iron barrier.\r\n\r\nStern flung his shoulder against the door. Creaking, it swung. He\r\nstaggered through. One hand groped out to steady him, against the\r\nwall. From the other the ax dropped crashing to the floor.\r\n\r\nOnly a second he stood thus, swaying; then he turned and gathered Beta\r\nin his arms. And on his breast she hid her face, from which the roses\r\nall had faded quite.\r\n\r\nHe felt her fighting back the tears, and raised her head and kissed\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"There, there!\" he soothed. \"It wasn't anything, after all, you see.\r\nBut--if we hadn't brought the ax with us--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Allan, let's go now! This crypt--I can't--\"\r\n\r\n\"We will go very soon. But there's no danger now, darling. We're not\r\nchildren, you know. We've still got work to do. We'll go soon; but\r\nfirst, those records!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how can you, after--after what might have been?\"\r\n\r\nHe found the strength to smile.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" he answered, \"but it didn't happen, after all. A miss is\r\nworth a million miles, dear. That's what life seems to mean to us, and\r\nhas meant ever since we woke in the tower, peril and risk, labor and\r\ntoil--and victory! Come, come, let's get to work again, for there's so\r\nendlessly much to do.\"\r\n\r\nCalmer grown, the girl found new courage in his eyes and in his strong\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Allan. I was a little fool to--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped her self-reproach with kisses, then picked up the torch\r\nfrom the floor where it had fallen from her nerveless hand.\r\n\r\n\"If you prefer,\" he offered. \"I'll take you back into the sunlight,\r\nand you can sit under the trees and watch the river, while I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Where you are, there am I! Come on, Allan; let's get it over with.\r\nOh, what a coward you must think me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you're a woman, and the bravest that ever lived!\" he\r\nexclaimed vehemently. \"Who but you could ever have gone through with\r\nme all that has happened? Who could be my mate and face the future as\r\nyou're doing? Oh, if you only understood my estimate of you!\r\n\r\n\"But now let's get at those records again. Time's passing, and there\r\nmust be still no end of things to do!\"\r\n\r\nHe recovered his ax, and with another blow demolished the last\r\nfragment of the staple, so that by no possibility could the door catch\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThen for the second time they penetrated the crypt and the tunnel and\r\nonce more reached the alcove of the records.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Allan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look! Gone--all gone!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Gone?_ Why, what do you mean? They're--\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone, I tell you! My God! Just a mass of rubbish, powder, dust--\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but how--\"\r\n\r\n\"The concussion of the ax! That must have done it! The violent\r\nsound-waves--the air in commotion!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Allan, it can't be! Surely there must be something left?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see?\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed at the shelves. She stood and peered, with him, at the sad\r\nhavoc wrought there. Then she stretched out a tentative finger and\r\nstirred a little of the detritus.\r\n\r\n\"Catastrophe!\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"Yes and no. At any rate, it may have been inevitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Inevitable?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Even if this hadn't happened, Beatrice, I'm afraid we never could\r\nhave moved any of these parchments, or read them, or handled them in\r\nany way. Perhaps if we'd had all kinds of proper appliances, glass\r\nplates, transparent adhesives, and so on, _and_ a year or two at our\r\ndisposal, we might have made something out of them, but even so, it's\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, in detective stories, Hawkshaw can take the ashes right\r\nout of the grate and piece them together and pour chemicals on them\r\nand decipher the mystery of the lost rubies, and all that. But this\r\nisn't a story, you see; and what's more, Hawkshaw doesn't have to work\r\nwith ashes nearly a thousand years old. Ten centuries of\r\ndry-rot--that's _some_ problem!\"\r\n\r\nShe stood aghast, hardly able to believe her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"But--but,\" she finally articulated, \"there's the other cache out\r\nthere in Medicine Bow Range. The cave, you know. And we have the\r\nbearings. And some time, when we've got all the leisure in the world\r\nand all the necessary appliances--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, perhaps. Although, of course, you realize the earth is seventeen\r\ndegrees out of its normal plane, and every reckoning's shifted. Still,\r\nit's a possibility. But for the present there's strictly nothing\r\ndoing, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about that leaden chest?\"\r\n\r\nShe wheeled about and pointed at the other side of the alcove, where\r\nstood the metal box, sullen, defiant, secure.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, that's so, tool Why, I'd all but forgotten that! You're a\r\nbrick, Beta! The box, by all means. Perhaps the most important things\r\nof all are still in safety there. Who knows?\"\r\n\r\n\"Open it, Allan, and let's see!\"\r\n\r\nHer recent terror almost forgotten in this new excitement, the girl\r\nhad begun to get back some of her splendid color. And now, as she\r\nstood gazing at the metal chest which still, perhaps, held the most\r\nvital of the records, she felt again a thrill of excitement at thought\r\nof all its possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe man, too, gazed at it with keen emotion.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to be careful this time, Beatrice!\" said he. \"No more\r\nmistakes. If we lose the contents of this chest, Heaven only knows\r\nwhen we may be able to get another glimpse into the past. Frankly, the\r\njob of opening it, without ruining the contents, looks pretty stiff.\r\nStill, with care it may be done. Let's see, now, what are we up\r\nagainst here?\"\r\n\r\nHe took the torch from her and minutely examined the leaden casket.\r\n\r\nIt stood on the concrete floor, massive and solid, about three and a\r\nhalf feet high by five long and four wide. So far as he could see,\r\nthere were neither locks nor hinges. The cover seemed to have been\r\nhermetically sealed on. Still visible were the marks of the\r\nsoldering-iron, in a ragged line, about three inches from the top.\r\n\r\n\"The only way to get in here is to cut it open,\" said Allan at last.\r\n\"If we had any means of melting the solder, that would be better, of\r\ncourse, but there's no way to heat a tool in this crypt. I take it the\r\nmen who did this work had a plumber's gasoline torch, or something of\r\nthat sort. We have practically nothing. As for building a fire in here\r\nand heating one of the aeroplane tools, that's out of the question. It\r\nwould stifle us both. No, we must cut. That's the best we can do.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew his hunting-knife from its sheath and, giving the torch back\r\nto Beatrice, knelt by the chest. Close under the line of soldering he\r\ndug the blade into the soft metal, and, boring with it, soon made a\r\npuncture through the leaden sheet.\r\n\r\n\"Only a quarter of an inch thick,\" he announced, with satisfaction.\r\n\"This oughtn't to be such a bad job!\"\r\n\r\nAlready he was at work, with infinite care not to shock or jar the\r\nprecious contents within. In his powerful hands the knife laid back\r\nthe metal in a jagged line. A quarter of an hour sufficed to cut\r\nacross the entire front.\r\n\r\nHe rested a little while.\r\n\r\n\"Seems to be another chest inside, of wood,\" he told the girl. \"Not\r\ndecayed, either. I shouldn't wonder if the lead had preserved things\r\nabsolutely intact. In that case this find is sure to be a rich one.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he set to work. In an hour from the time he had begun, the whole\r\ntop of the lead box--save only that portion against the wall--had been\r\ncut off.\r\n\r\n\"Do you dare to move it out, Allan?\" queried the girl anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Better not. I think we can raise the cover as it is.\"\r\n\r\nHe slit up the front corners, and then with comparative ease bent the\r\nentire top upward. To the explorer's eyes stood revealed a chest of\r\ncedar, its cover held with copper screws.\r\n\r\n\"Now for it!\" said the man. \"We ought to have one of the screw-drivers\r\nfrom the Pauillac, but that would take too much time. I guess the\r\nknife will do.\"\r\n\r\nWith the blade he attacked the screws, one by one, and by dint of\r\nlaborious patience in about an hour had removed all twenty of them.\r\n\r\nA minute later he had pried up the cover, had quite removed it, and\r\nhad set it on the floor.\r\n\r\nWithin, at one side, they saw a formless something swathed in oiled\r\ncanvas. The other half of the space was occupied by eighty or a\r\nhundred vertical compartments, in each of which stood something\r\ncarefully enveloped in the same material.\r\n\r\n\"Well, for all the world if it doesn't look like a set of big\r\nphonograph records!\" exclaimed the man. He drew one of the objects out\r\nand very carefully unwrapped it.\r\n\r\n\"Just what they are--records! On steel. The new Chalmers-Enemarck\r\nprocess--new, that is, in 1917. So, then, that's a phonograph, eh?\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed at the oiled canvas.\r\n\r\n\"Open it, quick, Allan!\" Beatrice exclaimed. \"If it _is_ a phonograph,\r\nwhy, we can hear the very voices of the past, the dead, a full\r\nthousand years ago!\"\r\n\r\nWith trembling fingers Stern slit the canvas wrappings.\r\n\r\n\"What a treasure! What a find!\" he exulted. \"Look, Beta--see what\r\nfortune has put into our hands!\"\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke he was lifting the great phonograph from the space\r\nwhere, absolutely uninjured and intact, it had reposed for ten\r\ncenturies. A silver plate caught his eye. He paused to read:\r\n\r\n  METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE,\r\n    New York City.\r\n\r\nThis Phonograph and these Records were immured in the vault of this\r\nbuilding September 28, 1918, by the Philavox Society, to be opened in\r\nthe year 2000.\r\n\r\n  Non Pereat Memoria Musicae Nostrae.\r\n\r\n\"Let not the memory of our music perish!\" he translated. \"Why, I\r\nremember well when these records were made and deposited in the\r\nMetropolitan! A similar thing was done in Paris, you remember, and in\r\nBerlin. But how does this machine come _here?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably the expedition reached New York, after all, and decided to\r\ntransfer this treasure to a safer place where it might be absolutely\r\nsafe and dry,\" she suggested. \"It's here, anyhow; that's the main\r\nthing, and we've found it. What fortune!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's lucky, all right enough,\" the man assented, setting the\r\nmagnificent machine down on the floor of the crypt. \"So far as I can\r\nsee, the mechanism is absolutely all right in every way. They've even\r\nput in a box of the special fiber needles for use on the steel plates,\r\nBeta. Everything's provided for.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, the expedition must have been a much larger one than we\r\nthought? It was no child's play to invade the ruins of New York,\r\nrescue all this, and transport it here, probably with savages dogging\r\ntheir heels every step. Those certainly were determined, vigorous men,\r\nand a goodly number at that. And the fight they must have put up in\r\nthe cathedral, defending their cache against the enemy, and dying for\r\nit, must been terrifically dramatic!\r\n\r\n\"But all that's done and forgotten now, and we can only guess a bit of\r\nit here and there. The tangible fact is this machine and these\r\nrecords, Beatrice. They're real, and we've got them. And the quicker\r\nwe see what they have to tell us the better, eh?\"\r\n\r\nShe clapped her hands with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"Put on a record, Allan, quick! Let's hear the voices of the past once\r\nmore--human voices--the voices of the age that was!\" she cried,\r\nexcited as a child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTILL DEATH US DO PART\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All right, my darling,\" he made answer. \"But not here. This is no\r\nplace for melody, down in this dark and gloomy crypt, surrounded by\r\nthe relics of the dead. We've been buried alive down here altogether\r\ntoo long as it is. _Brrr!_ The chill's beginning to get into my very\r\nbones! Don't you feel it, Beta?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, now I stop to think of it. Well, let's go up then. We'll have\r\nour music where it belongs, in the cathedral, with sunshine and air\r\nand birds to keep it company!\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later they had transported the magnificent phonograph and\r\nthe steel records out of the crypt and up the spiral stairway, into\r\nthe vast, majestic sweep of the transept.\r\n\r\nThey placed their find on the broad concrete steps that in the old\r\ndays had led up to the altar, and while Allan minutely examined the\r\nmechanism to make sure that all was right, the girl, sitting on the\r\ntop step, looked over the records.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Allan, here are instrumental as well as vocal masterpieces,\" she\r\nannounced with joy. \"Just listen--here's Rossini's 'Barbier de\r\nSeville,' and Grieg's 'Anitra's Dance' from the 'Peer Gynt Suite,' and\r\nhere's that most entrancing 'Barcarolle' from the 'Contes\r\nd'Hoffman'--you remember it?\"\r\n\r\nShe began to hum the air, then, as the harmony flowed through her\r\nsoul, sang a few lines, her voice like gold and honey:\r\n\r\n  Belle nuit, o nuit d'amour, souris a nos ivresses!\r\n  Nuit plus douce que le jour, o belle nuit d'amour!\r\n  Le temps fuit et sans retour emporte nos tendresses;\r\n  Loin de cet heureux sejour le temps fuit sans retour!\r\n    Zephyrs embrases, versez-nous vos caresses!\r\n    Ah! Donnez-nous vos baisers!\r\n\r\nThe echoes of Offenbach's wondrous air, a crystal stream of harmony,\r\nand of the passion-pulsing words, died through the vaulted heights. A\r\nmoment Allan sat silent, gazing at the girl, and then he smiled.\r\n\r\n\"It lives in you again, the past!\" he cried. \"In you the world shall\r\nbe made new once more! Beatrice, when I last heard that 'Barcarolle'\r\nit was sung by Farrar and Scotti at the Metropolitan, in the winter of\r\n1913. And now--you waken the whole scene in me again!\r\n\r\n\"I seem to behold the vast, clear-lighted space anew, the tiers of\r\ngilded galleries and boxes, the thousands of men and women hanging\r\neagerly on every silver note--I see the marvelous orchestra, many, yet\r\none; the Venetian scene, the moonlight on the Grand Canal, the\r\ngondolas, the merrymakers--I hear Giulietta and Nicklausse blending\r\nthose perfect tones! My heart leaps at the memory, beloved, and I\r\nbless you for once more awakening it!\"\r\n\r\n\"With my poor voice?\" she smiled. \"Play it, play the record, Allan,\r\nand let us hear it as it should be sung!\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he declared. \"Not after you have sung it. Your voice to me is\r\ninfinitely sweeter than any that the world of other days ever so much\r\nas dreamed of!\"\r\n\r\nHe bent above her, caressed her hair and kissed her; and for a little\r\nwhile they both forgot their music. But soon the girl recalled him to\r\nthe work in hand.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Allan, there's so much to do!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. Well now--let's see, what next?\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, a new thought in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Beta!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't find Mendelssohn's 'Wedding March,' do you? Look, dearest,\r\nsee if you can find it. Perhaps it may be there. If so--\"\r\n\r\nShe eyed him, her gaze widening.\r\n\r\n\"You mean?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Just so! Perhaps, after all, you and I can--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come and help me look for it, Allan!\" she cried enthusiastic as a\r\nchild in the joy of his new inspiration. \"If we only _could_ find it,\r\nwouldn't that be glorious?\"\r\n\r\nEagerly they searched together.\r\n\r\n\"'Ich Grolle Nicht,' by Schumann, no,\" Stern commented, as one by one\r\nthey examined the records. \"'Ave Maria,' Arcadelt-Liszt--no, though\r\nit's magnificent. That's the one you sing best of all, Beta. How often\r\nyou've sung it to me! Remember, at the bungalow, how I used to lay my\r\nhead in your lap while you played with my Samsonesque locks and sang\r\nme to sleep? Let's see--Brahms's 'Wiegenlied.' Cradle-song, eh? A\r\nlittle premature; that's coming later. Eh? Found it, by Jove! Here we\r\nare, the March itself, so help me! Shall I play it now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, Allan. Here, see what _I've_ found!\"\r\n\r\nShe handed him a record as they sat there together in a broad ribbon\r\nof mid-morning sunlight that flooded down through one of the\r\nclearstory windows.\r\n\r\n\"'The Form of the Solemnization of Matrimony, by Bishop Gibson,'\" he\r\nread. And silence fell, and for a long minute their eyes met.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know; I understand! So, after all, these words--\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall be spoken, O my love! Out of the dead past a voice shall speak\r\nto us and we shall hear! Beatrice, the words your mother heard, my\r\nmother heard, we shall hear, too. Come, Beatrice, for now the time is\r\nat hand!\"\r\n\r\nShe fell a trembling, and for a moment could not speak. Her eyes grew\r\nveiled in tears, but through them he saw a bright smile break, like\r\nsunlight after summer showers.\r\n\r\nShe stood up and held out her hand to him.\r\n\r\n\"My Allan!\"\r\n\r\nIn his arms he caught her.\r\n\r\n\"At last!\" he whispered. \"Oh, at last!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the majesty and beauty of the immortal\r\nmarriage hymn climbed the high vaults of the cathedral, waking the\r\nechoes of the vacant spaces, and when it rolled, pealing triumphantly,\r\nshe leaned her head upon his breast and, trembling, clung to him.\r\n\r\nWith his arm he clasped her; he leaned above her, shrouding her in his\r\nlove as in an everlasting benison. And through their souls thrilled\r\nwonder, awe and passion, and life held another meaning and another\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nThe words of solemn sacredness hallowed for centuries beyond the\r\nmemory of man, rose powerful, heart-thrilling, deep with symbolism,\r\nstrong with vibrant might--and, hand in hand, the woman and the man\r\nbowed their heads, listening:\r\n\r\n\"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join together this man and\r\nthis woman in holy matrimony--reverently, discreetly, advisedly,\r\nsoberly. Into this holy estate these two persons present now come to\r\nbe joined.\"\r\n\r\nHis hand tightened upon her hand, for he felt her trembling. But\r\nbravely she smiled up at him and upon her hair the golden sunlight\r\nmade an aureole.\r\n\r\nThe voice rose in its soul-shaking question--slow and powerful:\r\n\r\n\"Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife, to live together in\r\nthe holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor,\r\nand keep her in sickness and in health, and keep thee only unto her,\r\nso long as ye both shall live?\"\r\n\r\nAllan's \"_I will!_\" was as a hymn of joy upon the morning air.\r\n\r\n\"Wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband, to live together in\r\nthe holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou serve him, love, honor, and\r\nkeep him in sickness and in health, and keep thee only unto him, so\r\nlong as ye both shall live?\"\r\n\r\nShe answered proudly, bravely:\r\n\r\n\"I will!\"\r\n\r\nThen the man chorused the voice and said:\r\n\r\n\"I, Allan, take thee, Beatrice, to my wedded wife, to have and to\r\nhold from this day forward for better, for worse, for richer, for\r\npoorer, in sickness and in health to love and to cherish, till death\r\nus do part, and thereto I plight thee my troth.\"\r\n\r\nHer answer came, still led by the commanding voice, like an antiphony\r\nof love:\r\n\r\n\"I, Beatrice, take thee, Allan, to my wedded husband, to have and to\r\nhold from this day forward for better, for worse, for richer, for\r\npoorer, in sickness and in health to love and to cherish, till death\r\nus do part, and thereto I give thee my troth!\"\r\n\r\nAlready Allan had drawn from his little finger the plain gold ring he\r\nhad worn there so many centuries. Upon her finger he placed the ring\r\nand kissed it, and, following the voice, he said:\r\n\r\n\"With this ring I thee wed, and with all my worldly goods I thee\r\nendow. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy\r\nGhost. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nForest, river, sky and golden sunlight greeted them as they stood on\r\nthe broad porch of the cathedral, and the clear song of many birds,\r\nunafraid in the virgin wilderness, made music to their ears such as\r\nmust have greeted the primal day.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Allan caught and crushed her in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"My wife!\" he whispered.\r\n\r\nThe satin of her skin from breast to brow surged into sudden flame.\r\nHer eyes closed and between her eager lips the breath came fast.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Allan--_husband!_ I feel--I hear--\"\r\n\r\n\"The voice of the unborn, crying to us from out the dark, 'O father,\r\nmother, give us life!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nAT SETTLEMENT CLIFFS\r\n\r\n\r\nTen days later the two lovers--now man and wife--were back\r\nagain at the eastern lip of the Abyss. With them on the biplane they\r\nhad brought the phonograph and records, all securely wrapped in oiled\r\ncanvas, the same which had enveloped the precious objects in the\r\nleaden chest.\r\n\r\nThey made a camp, which was to serve them for a while as headquarters\r\nin their tremendous undertaking of bringing the Merucaans to the\r\nsurface, and here carefully stored their treasure in a deep cleft of\r\nrock, secure from rain and weather.\r\n\r\nThey had not revisited the bungalow on the return trip. The sight of\r\ntheir little home and garden, now totally devastated, they knew would\r\nonly sadden them unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\"Let it pass, dearest, as a happy memory that was and is no more,\"\r\nStern cheered the girl as he held her in his arms the first night of\r\ntheir stay in the new camp, and as together they watched the purple\r\nhaze of sunset beyond the chasm. \"Some day, perhaps, we may go back\r\nand once more restore Hope Villa and live there again, but for the\r\npresent many other and far more weighty matters press. It will be\r\nwisest for a while to leave the East alone. Too many of the Horde are\r\nstill left there. Here, west of the Ohio River Valley, they don't seem\r\nto have penetrated--and what's more, they never shall! Just now we\r\nmust ignore them--though the day of reckoning will surely come! We've\r\ngot our hands full for a while with the gigantic task ahead of us.\r\nIt's the biggest and the hardest that one man and one woman ever\r\ntackled since the beginning of time!\"\r\n\r\nShe drew his head down and kissed him, and for a little while they\r\nkept the silence of perfect comradeship. But at last she questioned:\r\n\r\n\"You've got it all worked out at last, Allan? You know just the steps\r\nto take? One false move--\"\r\n\r\n\"There shall be no false moves. Reason, deliberation, care will solve\r\nthis problem like all the others. Given some fifteen hundred people,\r\nat a depth of five hundred miles, and given an aeroplane and plenty of\r\ntime--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course, they can be brought to the surface. But after that,\r\nwhat? The dangers are tremendous! The patriarch died at the first\r\ntouch of sunlight. We can't afford to take chances with the rest!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've planned on all that. Our first move must be to locate a rocky\r\nledge, a cave, or something of the sort, where the transplanting\r\nprocess can be carried out. There mustn't be any exposure to the\r\nactual daylight for a long time after they're on the surface. The\r\ndetails of food and water have all got to be arranged, too. It means\r\nwork, work, _work!_ God, what work! But--it's our task, Beta, all our\r\nown. And I glory in it. I thank Heaven for it--a man's-size labor! And\r\nif we're strong and brave enough, patient and wise enough, we're bound\r\nto win.\"\r\n\r\n\"Win? Of course we'll win!\" she answered, her faith in him touching\r\nthe sublime. \"We must! The life of the whole world's at stake!\"\r\n\r\nNight came, and redder glowed the firelight in the gloom. They spoke\r\nof life, of love, of destiny; and over them seemed to brood the\r\nmystery of all that was to be.\r\n\r\nThe very purpose of the universe enwrapped itself about their passion,\r\nand the untroubled stars kept vigils till the dawn.\r\n\r\nDaylight called them to begin the epic campaign they had mapped\r\nout--the rescue of a race.\r\n\r\nAfter a visit to the patriarch's grave, which they decked anew with\r\nblossoms and fresh leaves, they prepared for the journey in search of\r\na suitable temporary home for the Folk.\r\n\r\nNine o'clock found them once more on the wing. Stern laid a southerly\r\ncourse along the edge of the Abyss. He and Beatrice had definitely\r\ndecided that the new home of humanity was not to be the distant\r\nregions of the East, involving so long and perilous a journey, but\r\nrather some location in the vast, warm, central plain of what had once\r\nbeen the United States.\r\n\r\nThey judged they were now somewhere in the one-time State of Indiana,\r\nnot far from Indianapolis. So much warmer had the climate grown that\r\nfor some months to come at least the Folk could without doubt accustom\r\nthemselves to the change from the hot and muggy atmosphere of the\r\nAbyss to the semitropic heat.\r\n\r\nThe main object now was to discover suitable caves near a good water\r\nsupply, where by night the Folk could prosecute their accustomed\r\nfisheries. Agriculture and the care of domestic animals by daylight\r\nwould have to be postponed for some time, possibly for a year or more.\r\nAbove all, the health of the prospective colonists must be\r\nsafeguarded.\r\n\r\nIt was not until nearly nightfall of the next day, and after stops had\r\nbeen made at the ruins of two considerable but unidentified towns--for\r\nfuel, as well as to fit up an electric search-light and hooded lamps\r\nto illuminate the instruments in the Abyss--that the explorers found\r\nwhat they were seeking.\r\n\r\nAbout half past five that afternoon they sighted a very considerable\r\nriver, flowing westward down a rugged and irregular valley, in the\r\ndirection of the chasm.\r\n\r\n\"This can't be the Ohio,\" judged Stern. \"We must have long since\r\npassed its bed, now probably dried up. I don't remember any such hilly\r\nregion as this in the old days along the Mississippi Valley. All these\r\nformations must be the result of the cataclysm. Well, no matter, just\r\nso we find what we're after.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are we now?\" she asked, peering downward anxiously. \"Over what\r\nState--can you tell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably Tennessee or northern Alabama. See the change in vegetation?\r\nNo conifers here, but many palms and fern-trees, and new, strange\r\ngrowths. Fertile isn't the name for it! Once we clear some land here,\r\ncrops will grow themselves! I don't think we'll do better than this,\r\nBeta. Shall we land and see?\"\r\n\r\nA quarter-hour later the Pauillac had safely deposited them on a high,\r\nrocky plateau about half a mile back from the edge of the river\r\ncanyon. Stern, in his eagerness, was all for cave-hunting that very\r\nevening, but the girl restrained him.\r\n\r\n\"Not so impatient, dear!\" she cautioned. \"'Too fast arrives as tardy\r\nas too slow!' To-morrow's time enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ruling me with quotations from Shakespeare, eh?\" he laughed, with a\r\nkiss. \"All right, have your way--_Mrs._ Stern!\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed, too, at this, the first time she had heard her new name.\r\nSo they made camp and postponed further labors till daylight again.\r\n\r\nMorning found them early astir and at work. Together they traversed\r\nthe tropic-seeming woods, aflame with brilliant flowers, dank with\r\nferns and laced with twining lianas.\r\n\r\nIn the treetops--strange trees, fruit laden--parrakeets and flashing\r\ngreen and crimson birds of paradise disturbed the little monkey-folk\r\nthat chattered at the intruders. Once a coral-red snake whipped away,\r\nhissing, but not quick enough to dodge a ball from Stern's revolver.\r\n\r\nStern viewed the ugly, triangular head with apprehension. Well he knew\r\nthat venom dwelt there, but he said nothing. The one and only chance\r\nof successfully transplanting the Folk must be to regions warm as\r\nthese. All dangers must be braved a time till they could grow\r\nacclimated to the upper air. After that--but the vastness of the\r\nfuture deterred even speculation. Perils were inevitable. The more\r\nthere were to overcome the greater the victory.\r\n\r\n\"On to the cliffs!\" said he, clasping the girl's hand in his own and\r\nmaking a path for her.\r\n\r\nThus presently they reached the edge of the canyon.\r\n\r\n\"Magnificent!\" cried Beatrice as they came out on the overhang of the\r\nrock wall. \"With these fruitful woods behind, that river in front, and\r\nthese natural fortifications for our home, what more could we want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing except caves,\" Stern answered. \"Let's call this New Hope\r\nRiver, eh? And the cliffs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Settlement Cliffs!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Done! Well, now let's see.\"\r\n\r\nFor the better part of the morning they explored the face of the\r\npalisade. Its height, they estimated, ranged from two to three hundred\r\nfeet, shelving down in rough terraces to the rocky debris through and\r\nbeyond which foamed the strong current of New Hope River, a stream\r\naveraging about two hundred yards in width.\r\n\r\nUp-current a broader pool gave promise of excellent fishing. It\r\noverflowed into violent rapids, with swift, white waters noisily\r\ncascading.\r\n\r\n\"There, incidentally,\" Stern remarked, with the practical perception\r\nof the engineer, \"there's power enough, when properly harnessed, to\r\nlight a city and to turn machinery ad libitum. I don't see how we\r\ncould better this site, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if you think there are good chances for cave-dwellings,\" she made\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\"From what we've seen already, it looks promising. Of course, there'll\r\nbe a deal of work to do; but there are excellent possibilities here.\r\nFirst rate.\"\r\n\r\nFortune seemed bent on favoring them. The limestone cliff,\r\nfantastically eroded, offered a score of shelters, some shallow and\r\nneeding to be walled up in front, others deep and tortuous. All was in\r\nutter confusion.\r\n\r\nStern saw that the terraces would have to be blasted and leveled,\r\nroads and stairs built along the face of the rock and down to the\r\nriver, stalactites and stalagmites cut away, chambers fashioned, and a\r\nvast deal of labor done; but the rough framework of a cliff colony\r\nundeniably existed here. He doubted whether it would be possible to\r\nfind a more favorable site without long and tedious travels.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we'll take the apartments and sign the lease,\" he decided\r\ntoward noon, after they had clambered, pried, explored with improvised\r\ntorches, and penetrated far into some of the grottoes. \"The main thing\r\nto consider is that we can find darkness and humidity for the Folk by\r\nday. They mustn't be let out at first except in the night. It may be\r\nweeks or months before they can stand the direct sunlight. But that,\r\ntoo, will come. Patience, girl--patience and time--and all will yet be\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nYet, even as he spoke, a strange anxiety, a prescience of tremendous\r\ndifficulties, brooded in his soul. These were not cattle that he had\r\nto deal with, but _men_.\r\n\r\nCould he and Beatrice, rulers of the Folk though they now were, could\r\nthey--with their paltry knowledge of the people's language,\r\nsuperstitions, prejudices and inner life--really bring about this\r\ngreat migration?\r\n\r\nCould they ravish a nation from its accustomed home, transplant it\r\nbodily, force new conditions on it, train, teach, civilize it? All\r\nthis without rebellion, anarchy and failure?\r\n\r\n\"God!\" thought the engineer. \"The labors of Hercules were child's play\r\nbeside this problem!\"\r\n\r\nHis heart quaked at the thought of all that lay ahead; yet through\r\neverything, deep in the basic strata of his being, he knew that all\r\nshould be and must be as he planned.\r\n\r\nBarring death only, the seemingly impossible should come to pass.\r\n\r\n\"I swear it!\" he murmured to himself. \"For _her_ sake, for theirs, and\r\nfor the world's, I swear it shall be!\"\r\n\r\nAt high noon they emerged once more from the caverns, climbed the\r\nsteep cliff face, and again stood on the heights.\r\n\r\nFacing northward, their gaze swept the lower river-bank opposite, and\r\nreached away, away, over the rolling hills and plains that lay, a\r\nvirgin forest, to the dim horizon, brooding, mysterious, quivering\r\nwith fertility and wild, strange life.\r\n\r\n\"Some time,\" he prophesied, sweeping his arm out toward the\r\nwilderness--\"some time all _that_--and far beyond--shall be dotted\r\nwith clearings and rich farms, with cottages, schools, towns, cities.\r\nBroad highways shall traverse it. The hum of motors, of machinery, of\r\nindustry--of life itself--shall one day displace the cry of beast and\r\nbird.\r\n\r\n\"Some time the English tongue shall reign here again--here and beyond.\r\nHere strong men shall toil and build and reap and rest. Here love\r\nshall reign and women be called 'mother.' Here children shall play and\r\nlearn and grow to manhood and to womanhood, secure and free.\r\n\r\n\"Some time all good things shall here come to realization. Oppression\r\nand slavery, alone, shall be undreamed of. These, and poverty and\r\npain, shall never enter into the new world that is to be.\r\n\r\n\"Some time, here, 'all shall be better than well.' _Some time!_\"\r\n\r\nHe circled her with his arm, and for a while they stood surveying this\r\ncradle of the new race. Much moved, Beatrice drew very close to him.\r\nThey made no speech.\r\n\r\nFor the dreams they two were dreaming, as the golden sun irradiated\r\nall that vast, magnificent wilderness, passed any power of words.\r\n\r\nOnly she whispered \"Some time!\" too, and Allan knew she shared with\r\nhim the glory of his vast, tremendous vision!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSEPARATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThey spent the remainder of that day and all the next in hard\r\nwork, making practical preparations for the arrival of the first\r\nsettlers. Allan assured himself the waters of New Hope River were soft\r\nand pure and that an ample supply of fish dwelt in the pool as well as\r\nin the rapids--trout, salmon and pike of new varieties and great size,\r\nas well as other species.\r\n\r\nBeatrice and he, working together, put the largest and darkest of the\r\ncaves into habitable order. They also prepared, for their own use, a\r\nsunny grotto, which they thought could with reasonable labor be made\r\ninto a comfortable temporary home.\r\n\r\n\"Though it isn't our own cozy bungalow, and never can be,\" she\r\nremarked rather mournfully, surveying the fireplace of roughly piled\r\nstones Allan had built. \"Oh, dear, if we only could have had that to\r\nlive in while--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped her yearning with a kiss.\r\n\r\n\"There, there, little girl,\" he cheered her, \"don't be impatient. All\r\nin good time we'll have another, garden and sun-dial and everything.\r\nAll in good time. The more we have to overcome, the more we'll\r\nappreciate results, eh? The only really serious matter to consider now\r\nis _you!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Me, Allan? Why, what do you mean? What about me?\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the rough-hewn bench of logs that he had fashioned and\r\ndrew her to him.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Beta. This is very serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, Allan? Has anything happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, and nothing must, either. That's what's troubling me now. Our\r\nseparation, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our--why, what--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see? Can't you understand? We've got to be apart a while. I\r\nmust go alone--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no, Allan! You mustn't; I can't let you!\"\r\n\r\n\"You've _got_ to let me, darling! The machine will only carry, at\r\nmost, three persons and a little freight. Now if you take the trip\r\nback into the Abyss I can only bring one, just one of the Folk back\r\nwith me. And at that rate you can see for yourself how long it will\r\ntake to make even a beginning at colonization. I figure three or four\r\ndays for the round trip, at the inside. If you go we'll be all summer\r\nand more getting even twenty-five or thirty colonists here. Whereas,\r\nif you can manage to let me do this work alone, we'll have fifty in\r\nthe caves by October. So you see--\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't want to go and leave me, Allan?\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid! Shall I abandon the whole attempt and settle down with\r\nyou here, all alone, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no! Not that, Allan!\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew you'd say so. After all, the future of the race means more\r\nthan our own welfare or comfort or anything. Even our safety has got\r\nto be risked for it. So you see--\"\r\n\r\nShe thought a moment, clinging to him, somewhat pale and shaken, but\r\nwith an indefinable courage in her eyes. Then asked she:\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it be possible in some way--for you can do anything,\r\nAllan--wouldn't it be possible for you to build another machine?\r\nSurely in the ruins of some city not too far away, in Nashville,\r\nCincinnati, or Detroit, you could find materials! Couldn't you make\r\nanother aeroplane and teach me how to fly, so I could help you? I'd\r\nlearn, Allan! I'd dare, and be brave--awfully brave, for your sake,\r\nand theirs, and--\"\r\n\r\nHe gravely shook his head in negation.\r\n\r\n\"I know you would, dearest, but you mustn't. Half my real reason for\r\nnot wanting you to go with me is just this danger of flying. You'll be\r\nsafer here. With plenty of supplies and your pistol you'll be all\r\nright. I know it seems heartless to talk of leaving you, even for\r\nthree days, but, after all, it's far the wisest way. We'll build a\r\nbarricade and make a regular fort for you and stock it with supplies.\r\nThen you can wait for me and the first two settlers. And after that\r\nyou'll have company. Why, you'll have _subjects_--for, until they're\r\neducated, we've simply got to rule these people. It'll be only the\r\nfirst trip that will make you lonely, and it won't be long.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know; but suppose anything should happen to you!\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed confidently.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" he exclaimed. \"You know nothing ever _does_ happen to me!\r\nEverything will be all right, my best--beloved. Only a little patience\r\nand a little courage, that's all we need now. You'll see!\"\r\n\r\nTill late that night, sheltered in their cave, they talked of this\r\nmomentous step. Redly their firelight glowed upon their walls and\r\nroof, where sparkled myriads of tiny rock-facets. Far below the rapids\r\nof New Hope River murmured a contra-bass to their voices.\r\n\r\nAnd in the canyon the sighing of the night-wind, pierced now and then\r\nby some strange cry of beast-life from the forest beyond, heightened\r\ntheir pleasant sense of security. Only the knowledge of approaching\r\nseparation weighed heavy on their souls.\r\n\r\nFrom every possible standpoint they discussed the situation. Allan's\r\nplan, viewed with the eye of reason, was really the only sane one.\r\nNothing could have been more absurdly wasteful of time and energy than\r\nthe idea of carrying the girl down into the Abyss each time and\r\nbringing her up with every return.\r\n\r\nNot only would it expose her needlessly to very grave perils, but it\r\nwould bisect the efficiency of the Pauillac. Allan realized, moreover,\r\nthat in the rebuilding of the world a time must inevitably come when\r\nhe could not always stand by her side. She must learn self-reliance,\r\nharsh as that teaching might seem.\r\n\r\nAll this and much more he pointed out to her. And before midnight she,\r\ntoo, agreed. It was definitely decided that he was to undertake the\r\ntransportation work alone.\r\n\r\nThus the matter was settled. But on that night there was little sleep\r\nfor either of them. For, on the day after the morrow was to commence\r\ntheir first separation since the time they had awakened in the tower,\r\nmore than a year ago.\r\n\r\nSeparation!\r\n\r\nThe thought weighed leaden on Allan's heart. As for Beatrice, though\r\nin the dark she hid her tears, she felt that grief could plumb no\r\nblacker depths save utter loss. Only the thought of the new world and\r\nall that it must mean steeled her to resignation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning dawned, aflare with light and color, as\r\nonly a June morning in that semitropic wilderness could glow. Allan\r\nand Beatrice, early at work, resolutely attacked their labor of\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nFirst of all they laid in adequate supplies of fruit and game, both of\r\nwhich, in that virgin wild, were to be had in a profusion undreamed of\r\nin the old days of civilization. With an improvised lance Ahan also\r\nspeared three salmon in the rapids. The game and fish he dressed for\r\nher and packed among green leaves in the cool recesses at the extreme\r\ninner end of the cavern.\r\n\r\n\"No need whatever for you to leave the cave while I'm gone,\" he warned\r\nher. \"I'm not forbidding you to, because I'm not your master. All I\r\nsay is I'll be far happier if you stay close at home. Will you promise\r\nme that, whatever happens, you won't wander from the cave?\"\r\n\r\n\"I needn't promise, dearest. All I need to know is your wish. That's\r\nenough for me!\"\r\n\r\nTogether they set about fortifying the place. They built a rough but\r\nstrong barricade of rocks across the mouth of the cavern, leaving only\r\none small aperture, just sufficient to admit a single person on hands\r\nand knees.\r\n\r\nAllan fetched a rounded stone that she could roll into this door by\r\nnight and arranged a stout sapling to brace the stone immovably. He\r\nsupplied her well with fire-wood and saw to it that her bandoliers\r\nwere full of cartridges. In addition, he left her the extra gun and\r\nammunition they had found in the crypt under the cathedral.\r\n\r\nWith a torch he carefully explored every crevice of the cave to make\r\nsure no noxious spiders, centipedes, or serpents were sheltered there.\r\n\r\nFrom the Pauillac he brought his own cloak, which he insisted on her\r\nkeeping. This, with hers, would add to the comfort of the bed they had\r\nmade with fragrant ferns and grasses.\r\n\r\nHe fashioned, out of the tenacious clay of an earth-bank about half a\r\nmile down stream, two large water-jars, and baked them for some hours\r\nin a huge fire on the terrace in front of the cave.\r\n\r\nWhen properly hardened he scoured them carefully with river-sand and\r\nfilled them one at a time, struggling up the hard ascent with a stout\r\nheart--for all this toil meant safety for the girl; it was all another\r\nstep on the hard pathway toward the goal.\r\n\r\nIn her sleep that night he bent above her, kissed her tenderly, and\r\nrealized how inexpressibly dear she was to him.\r\n\r\nThe thought: \"To-morrow I must leave her!\" weighed heavy on him. And\r\nfor a long time he could not sleep, but lay listening to the night\r\nsounds of the forest and the brawling stream. Once a deep, booming\r\nroar echoed throughout the canyon, and thereto, hollow blows.\r\n\r\nBut Allan could not think their meaning. Only he knew the wild was\r\nfull of perils; and in his mind he reviewed the precautions he had\r\ntaken for her welfare. Bit by bit he analyzed them. He knew that he\r\ncould do no more Now Fate must solve the rest.\r\n\r\nHe slept at length, not to waken till morning with its garish eye\r\npeeped in around the crevices of the rock doorway. Returning from his\r\nswim in the pool, he found Beatrice already making breakfast. They ate\r\nin silence, overborne with sad and bodeful thoughts.\r\n\r\nBut now the decision had been made, nothing remained save to execute\r\nit. Such a contingency as backing out of an undertaking once begun lay\r\nfar outside their scheme of things.\r\n\r\nThe leave-taking was not delayed. They both realized that an early\r\nstart was necessary if he were to reach the village of the Folk before\r\nsleep should assail him. Still more, they dreaded the departure less\r\nthan the suspense.\r\n\r\nTogether they provisioned the Pauillac, back there on the rocky\r\nbarren, and made sure everything was in order. Allan assured himself\r\nespecially that he had fuel enough to last four or five hours.\r\n\r\n\"In that time,\" he told the girl, \"I can easily reach the rim of the\r\nAbyss. You see, I needn't fly northward to the point where we emerged.\r\nThat would be only an unnecessary waste of time and energy. I'm\r\npositive the chasm extends all the way up and down what was once the\r\nMississippi Valley, and that the Great Central Sea is fed by that and\r\nother rivers. In that case, by striking almost due west, I can reach\r\nthe rim. After that I can volplane easily till I sight the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the power goes on again and I scout for the west shore and the\r\nvillage. The sustaining power of that lower-level air is simply\r\nmiraculous. I realize perfectly well it's no child's play, but I can\r\ndo it, Beta. I can find the place again. You see, I'm perfectly\r\nfamiliar with conditions down there now. The first time it was all new\r\nand strange. This time, after all those months in the Abyss, why, it\r\nwill be almost like getting back home again. It'll be quite a\r\ntriumphal return, won't it? The chief getting back to his tribe, eh?\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to speak lightly, but his lips refused to smile. She frankly\r\nwept.\r\n\r\n\"There, there, little girl,\" he soothed her. \"Now let's go back to the\r\ncave and see that you're all right and safe. Then I'll be going.\r\nRemember on the third night to kindle the big fire we've agreed on\r\njust outside your door on the terrace--the beacon-fire, you know. I'll\r\nhave to reckon by the chronometer, so as to make the return by night.\r\nThe risk of bringing any of the Folk into daylight is prohibitive. And\r\nthe fire will be tremendously important. I can sight it a long way\r\noff. It will guide me home--to you!\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded silently, for she did not trust herself to speak.. Hand in\r\nhand they returned along the path they had beaten through the rank\r\nhalf-tropic growth.\r\n\r\nOne last inspection he gave to all things necessary for her comfort.\r\nThen, standing in the warm, bright sunlight on the ledge before the\r\nnew home, he took her in his arms.\r\n\r\nA long embrace, a parting kiss that clung; then he was gone.\r\n\r\nNot long after the girl, still standing there upon the windswept\r\nterrace overlooking New Hope River, heard the rapid chatter of the\r\nengine high in air and rapidly approaching.\r\n\r\nA swift black shadow leaped the canyon and swept away across the\r\nplain. Far aloft she saw the skimming Pauillac, very small and black\r\nagainst the dazzling blue.\r\n\r\nDid Allan wave a hand to her? Could she hear his farewell cry?\r\n\r\nImpossible to tell. Her ears, confused by the roaring of the rapids,\r\nher eyes dazzled by the shimmer of the morning heavens and dimmed by\r\nburning tears, refused to serve her.\r\n\r\nBut bravely she waved her cloak on high. Bravely she strove to watch\r\nthe arrow-flight of the swift bird-man till the tiny machine dwindled\r\nto a moving blur, a point, a mere speck on the far horizon, then\r\nvanished in the blue.\r\n\r\nChoked with anguish, against which all her courage, all her philosophy\r\ncould not make way, Beatrice sank down upon the rocky ledge and\r\nabandoned herself to grief.\r\n\r\nAllan was gone at last! Gone--ever to return? At last she was alone in\r\nthe unbroken wilderness!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\"HAIL TO THE MASTER!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEleven hours of incessant labor, care, watchfulness and\r\nfatigue, three hours of flight and eight of coasting into the terrific\r\ndepths, brought Allan once more through the fogs, the dark, the heat,\r\nto sight of the vast sunken sea, five hundred miles below the surface.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole stupendous labor he thanked Heaven the girl was\r\nsafely left behind, nor forced to share this travail and exhaustion.\r\nMyriad anxieties and fears assailed him--fears he had taken good care\r\nnot to let her know or dream of.\r\n\r\nAlways existed the chance that something might go wrong about the\r\nmachine and it be hurled, with him, into that black and steaming sea;\r\nthe possibility of landing not among the Folk, but in some settlement\r\nof the Lanskaarn on the rumored islands he had never seen; the menace\r\nof the Great Vortex, of which he knew nothing save the little that the\r\npatriarch had told him.\r\n\r\nAll these and many other perils sought to force themselves upon his\r\nmind. But Allan put them resolutely back and, guided by his\r\ninstruments, his reason, and that marvelous sixth sense of location\r\nwhich his long months of battling with the wilderness had brought to\r\nbirth in him, swiftly yet carefully slid in vast spirals down the\r\npurple, then the black and terrifying void that yawned interminably\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThe beam of his underslung searchlight, shifting at his will, shot its\r\nwhite ray in a long, fading pencil downward as he coasted. And hour\r\nafter hour it found nothing whereon to rest. It, too, seemed lost\r\nforever in the welter of uprushing, choking vapors from the pit.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! _At last!_\"\r\n\r\nThe cry, dull in that compressed air, burst triumphantly from his lips\r\nas the light-ray, suddenly piercing a rift of cloud, sparkled dimly on\r\na surface shiny-black as newly cleft anthracite.\r\n\r\nAllan threw in the motor once more and quickly got the Pauillac under\r\ncontrol. In a long downward slant he rushed, like some vast swallow\r\nskimming a pool, over the mysterious plain of steaming waters. And\r\never, peering eagerly ahead, he sought a twinkle of the fishermen's\r\noil-flares wimpling across the sunken sea.\r\n\r\nMoment by moment he consulted his instruments and the chart he had\r\nstretched before him under the gleam of the hooded bulbs.\r\n\r\n\"Inside of half an hour now,\" said he, \"I ought to sight the first\r\nflash of the flares upon the parapet--the glow of the flaming well!\"\r\n\r\nAnd a singular eagerness all at once possessed him, a strange yearning\r\nto behold once more the strange, fog-shrouded, reeking City of the\r\nLost People, almost as though it had been home, as though these white\r\nbarbarians had been his own people.\r\n\r\nMen! To see men once more! The idea leaped up and gripped him with a\r\npowerful fascination.\r\n\r\nSo it was that when in reality the first faint twinkle of the\r\nfishing-boats peeped through the mist--and beyond, a tiny necklace of\r\ngleaming points that he knew marked the walls of the town--his heart\r\nthrobbed hotly and a cry of eager greeting welled from his soul.\r\n\r\nQuickly the Pauillac swept him onward. Manoeuvering cautiously,\r\njockeying the great machine with that consummate skill he had acquired\r\nfrom long practice, he soon beheld the dim outlines of the vast cliff,\r\nthe long walls, the dull reflections of the fire-plume, the slanting\r\nslope of beach.\r\n\r\nAnd with keen exultation, thrilled with his triumph and his greeting\r\nto the Folk he came to rescue, he landed with a whir upon the reeking\r\nslope.\r\n\r\nTo him, even before he had been able to free his cramped body from\r\nthe saddle, came swarming the people, with loud cries of welcome and\r\nrejoicing. Powerfully the automatics he and Beatrice had used in the\r\nBattle of the Walls had impressed their simple minds with almost\r\nsuperstitious reverence. More powerfully still his terrible fight with\r\nKamrou, ending with the death of that great chief in the boiling vat.\r\nAnd now, acknowledging him their overlord and ruler, whom they had\r\nfeared to lose forever, they trooped in wild, disordered throngs to\r\ndo him reverence.\r\n\r\nIn from the sea, summoned by waving flares, the fishing-boats came\r\nplowing mightily, driven by many paddles in the hands of the strange,\r\nwhite-haired men.\r\n\r\nAlong the beach the townsfolk thronged, and down the causeway, beneath\r\nthe vast monolithic plinth of the fortified gate, jostled and pushed\r\nan ever-growing multitude.\r\n\r\nCries of \"Kromno h'viat! Tai Kromno!\" reechoed--\"The chief has come\r\nback! The great master!\"--and the confusion swelled to a mighty roar,\r\nclose-pent under the heavy mists blued by the naphtha-torches.\r\n\r\nBut Stern noticed, and rejoiced to see it, that none prostrated\r\nthemselves. None fell to earth or groveled in his presence. Disorderly\r\nand wild the greeting was, but it was the greeting of men, not slaves.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God, I've got a race of real men to deal with here!\" thought\r\nhe, surveying the pressing throng. \"Hard they may be to rule, and even\r\nturbulent, but they're not servile. Rude, brave, bold--what better\r\nstock could I have hoped for in this great adventuring?\"\r\n\r\nFor a while even thoughts of Beatrice were crowded back by the\r\nexcitement of the arrival. In all his wonderful experience never\r\nbefore had he sensed a feeling such as this.\r\n\r\nTo be returning, master and lord of a race of long-buried people, his\r\nown people, after all--to be acknowledged chieftain--to hold their\r\ndestinies within his hand for good or evil--the magnitude of the\r\nsituation, the tremendous difficulties and responsibilities, almost\r\noverwhelmed him.\r\n\r\nHe felt a need to rest, and think, and plan, to recuperate from the\r\nlong journey and to recover poise and strength.\r\n\r\nAnd with relief, as he raised his hand for silence, he perceived the\r\nwrinkled face of one Vreenya, head councillor of Kamrou, his\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\nHim he summoned to come close, and to him gave his orders. With some\r\ndegree of fluency--for in the months Beatrice and he had spent in the\r\nAbyss they had acquired much of the Merucaan tongue--he said:\r\n\r\n\"I greet you, Vreenya. I greet my people, all. Harken. I have made a\r\nlong journey to return to you. I am tired and would rest. There be\r\nmany things to tell you, but not now. I would sleep and eat. Is my\r\nhouse in readiness?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is in readiness--the house of the Kromno. Your word is our law.\r\nIt shall be as you have spoken.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is good. Now it is my will that this air-boat on which I ride\r\nshould be carried close up to the walls and carefully covered with\r\nmantles, especially this part,\" and he gestured at the engines. \"After\r\nthat I rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it shall be,\" Vreenya made answer, while the Folk listened. \"But,\r\nmaster, where is the woman? Where is the ancient man, J'hungaav, who\r\nsailed with you in the air-boat to those upper regions we know not\r\nof?\"\r\n\r\n\"The woman is well. She awaits in a place we have prepared for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well. And the ancient man?\"\r\n\r\nStern thought quickly. To confess the patriarch's death would\r\ncertainly be fatal to the undertaking. These simple minds would judge\r\nfrom it that certain destruction must be the portion of any who should\r\ndare venture into those mysterious upper regions which to them were\r\nbut a myth, a strange tradition--almost a terror.\r\n\r\nAnd though the truth was dear to him, yet under stress of the greater\r\ngood he uttered falsehood by implication.\r\n\r\n\"The ancient man awaits you, too. He is resting in the far places. He\r\nwould desire you to come to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is at peace? He found the upper world good?\"\r\n\r\n\"He found it good, Vreenya. And he is at peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well. Now the commands of Tai Kromno shall be done. His house\r\nis ready!\"\r\n\r\nWhile Stern clambered out of the machine and stretched his\r\nhalf-paralyzed limbs, the news ran, a murmur of many voices, through\r\nthe massed Folk. Stern's heart swelled with pride at the success so\r\nfar of his mission. If all should go as well from now on, his mighty\r\nobject could and would be accomplished. But if not--\r\n\r\nHe shuddered slightly despite himself, for to his mind arose the\r\never-present possibility of the Folk's custom of trial by combat--the\r\nchance that some rebellious one might challenge him--that the outcome\r\nmight another time turn against him.\r\n\r\nHe remembered still the scream of Kamrou as the deposed chieftain had\r\nplunged into the boiling pool. What if this fate should some time yet\r\nbe _his?_ And once more thoughts of Beatrice obtruded; and, despite\r\nhimself, he felt the clutch of terror at his heart.\r\n\r\nHe put it resolutely away, however, for he realized that all depended\r\nnow on maintaining good courage and a bold, commanding air. The\r\nslightest weakness might at any time prove fatal.\r\n\r\nHe understood enough of the barbarian psychology to know the value of\r\ndominance. And with a command to Vreenya: \"Make way for me, your\r\nmaster!\" he advanced through the lane which the crowding Folk made for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAs, followed by the councillor and the elders, he climbed the slippery\r\ncauseway and passed through the labyrinthine passes of the great gate,\r\nstrange emotions stirred him.\r\n\r\nThe scene was still the same as when he first had witnessed it. Still\r\nflared the torches in the hands of the populace and along the walls,\r\nwhere, perched on the very ledge of the one-time battle with the\r\nLanskaarn, the strange waterfowl still blinked their ghostly eyes.\r\n\r\nNo change was to be witnessed in the enclosure, the huts, the wide\r\nplaza, stretching away to the cliff, to the fire-pit, and the Dungeon\r\nof Skeletons. But still how different was it all!\r\n\r\nOnly too clearly he remembered the first time he and Beatrice had been\r\nthrust into this weird community, bound and captive; with only too\r\nvivid distinctness he recalled the frightful indignities, perils and\r\nhardships inflicted on them.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the kindly patriarch saddened him; and, too, the fact\r\nthat now no Beatrice was with him there.\r\n\r\nSlowly, wearily, he moved along the slippery rock-floor toward his\r\nwaiting house, unutterably lonesome even in this pushing throng that\r\nnow acclaimed him, yet thanking God that the girl, at least, was far\r\nfrom the buried town of such hard ways and latent perils.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the round, conical stone hut that had been Kamrou's and\r\nnow was his--so long as he could hold the chieftainship by sheer force\r\nof will and power--he paused a moment and faced the eager throng.\r\n\r\n\"Peace to you, my people!\" he exclaimed, once more raising his hand on\r\nhigh. \"Soon I shall tell you many wonders and things strange to\r\nhear--many things of great import and good tidings.\r\n\r\n\"When I have slept I shall speak with you. Now I go to rest. Await me,\r\nfor the day of your deliverance is at hand!\"\r\n\r\nA face caught his attention, a sinister and, brutal face, doubly\r\nominous in the flaring cresset-glare. He knew the man--H'yemba, the\r\ncunning ironsmith, one who in other days had before now crossed his\r\nwill and, dog-like, snarled as much as he had dared. Now a peculiarly\r\nmalevolent expression lay upon the evil countenance. The dead-white\r\nskin wrinkled evilly; the pink eyes gleamed with disconcerting malice.\r\n\r\nBut Stern, dead tired, only glanced at H'yemba for a second, then with\r\nVreenya entered the hut and bade the door be closed.\r\n\r\nAll dressed as he was, he flung himself upon the rude bed of seaweed\r\ncovered with the coarse brown stuff woven by the Folk.\r\n\r\n\"Sleep, master,\" Vreenya said. \"I will sit here and watch. But before\r\nyou sleep loosen the terrible fire-bow that shoots the bolts of lead\r\nand lay it near at hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--there may be trouble here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sleep!\" was all the councillor would answer. \"When you have rested\r\nthere will be many things to ask and tell.\"\r\n\r\nSpent beyond the power of any further effort, Stern laid his automatic\r\nhandy and disposed himself to rest.\r\n\r\nAs his weary eyelids closed and the first outposts of consciousness\r\nbegan to fall before the attacking power of slumber, his thoughts, his\r\nlove, his enduring passion, reverted to the girl, the wife, now so\r\ninfinitely far away in the cavern beside the brawling canyon-stream.\r\nYearning and tenderness unspeakable flooded his soul.\r\n\r\nBut once or twice her face faded from his mental vision and in its\r\nstead he seemed to see again the surly stare, the evil eyes, and\r\nvenomously sinister expression of H'yemba, the resourceful man of fire\r\nand of steel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCHALLENGED!\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter many hours of profound and dreamless sleep, Allan awoke\r\nfilled with fresh vigor for the tasks that lay ahead. His splendid\r\nvitality, quickly recuperating, calmed his mind; and now the problems,\r\nthe anxieties and fears of the day before--to call it such, though\r\nthere was neither night nor day in this strange place--seemed\r\nnegligible.\r\n\r\nOnly a certain haunting uneasiness about the girl still clung to him.\r\nBut, sending her many a thought of love, he reflected that soon he\r\nshould be back again with her; and so, resolutely grasping the labor\r\nthat now awaited him, he felt fresh confidence and hope.\r\n\r\nAfter a breakfast of the familiar sea-weeds, bulbs, fish and eggs, he\r\nbade Vreenya (who seemed devotion incarnate) summon the folk for a\r\ngreat charweg, or tribal council, at the Place of Skeletons.\r\n\r\nHere they gathered, men, women and children, all of fifteen hundred,\r\nin close-packed, silent masses, leaving only the inner circle under\r\nthe stone posts and iron rods clear for Allan and for Vreenya and some\r\nhalf-dozen elders.\r\n\r\nThe rocky plaza-floor sloping upward somewhat from the dungeon, formed\r\na very shallow natural amphitheater, so that the majority could see as\r\nwell as hear.\r\n\r\nNo platform was there for their Kromno to speak from. He had not\r\neven a block of stone. In the true native style he was expected to\r\naddress them on their own level, pacing back and forth the while.\r\n\r\nIn his early days among them he had seen one or two such gatherings.\r\nHis quick wit prompted a close imitation of their ceremonies and\r\nancient customs.\r\n\r\nFirst, Vreenya sprinkled the open space between the poles and the\r\ndungeon with a kind of sea-weed swab dipped in the waters of the\r\nboiling vat, then with a bit of the coarse brown cloth washed Allan's\r\nlips--a pledge of truth.\r\n\r\nThe councillor raised both hands toward the roaring flame back there\r\nby the cliff, and all inclined themselves thereto, the only trace of\r\nany religious ceremony still remaining among them.\r\n\r\nAllan likewise saluted the flame; then he faced the multitude.\r\n\r\n\"O my people,\" he began, striving to speak clearly above the noise of\r\nthe fire-jet, his voice sounding dull and heavy in that compressed\r\natmosphere, \"O Folk of the Merucaans, I greet you! There be many\r\nthings to tell that you must know and believe. I have come back to you\r\nwith great peril in my flying-boat to tell you of the upper world and\r\nall its goodness.\r\n\r\n\"Easily could I have stayed in those places of light and plenty, but\r\nmy heart was warm for my people. I thought of my people night and day.\r\nThe woman Beatrice thought of you. The ancient man thought of you.\r\nAlone, we could not enjoy those happy places. So I returned to tell\r\nyou and to show you the way to liberty. Thus have we proved our love\r\nfor you, my folk!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused. Silence overhung the assemblage save for the fretful cry of\r\nchildren here and there, squeezed in the press or clinging to their\r\nmothers' backs after the fashion of the Merucaans.\r\n\r\nAfar, on the walls, the faint and raucous quarreling of the sea-birds\r\ndrifted through the fog. Allan drew breath and began again:\r\n\r\n\"In those places, my people, those far places whence your forefathers\r\ncame, are many wonders. Betimes it is dark, as always here. Betimes a\r\ngreat fire mounts into the upper air and make the whole world brighter\r\nthan around your flaming well. In the dark time lesser fires travel in\r\nthe air. Of birds there are many kinds, strangely colored. Of beasts,\r\nmany kinds--I cannot make you understand because none of you have ever\r\nseen any animal but fish and bird. But I speak truth. There be many\r\nother creatures with good flesh to eat, and the skins of them are\r\nproper for soft clothing.\r\n\r\n\"Here you have only weeds of the sea. There we have tall growing\r\nthings, many hundred spedi high, and rich fruit, delicious to the\r\ntaste, grows on some kinds. In a few words, it is a place of wondrous\r\nplenty, where you can all live more easily than here, and with more\r\npleasure--far--\"\r\n\r\nAgain he ceased his discourse, but still continued to pace up and down\r\nthe open space under the swaying skeletons on the poles above.\r\n\r\nThrough the dense press of the Folk murmurs were wandering. Man spoke\r\nto man, and many a new thought was coming now to birth among those\r\nwhite barbarians.\r\n\r\nThe elders, too, were whispering together: \"So runs the ancient\r\ntradition. So said the ancient man! Can it be true, indeed?\"\r\n\r\nStern continued, more and more earnestly, with the sweat now beginning\r\nto dot his brow:\r\n\r\n\"It were too long, my people, to tell you everything about that land\r\nof ours above. Only remember it is richer far and far more beautiful\r\nthan this, your place of darkness and of clouds. It is the ancient\r\nhome of your fathers in the very long ago. It is waiting for you once\r\nagain, more fertile and more beautiful than ever.\r\n\r\n\"My errand is to carry you thither--two or three at a time. At last I\r\nshall be able to take you all.\r\n\r\n\"Then the world will begin to be as it once was, before the great\r\nexplosion destroyed all but a few of your people, who were my people\r\nonce. Will any of you--any two bold men--believe my words and go with\r\nme? Will any be as brave as--the patriarch?\"\r\n\r\nHe flung the veiled taunt loudly at them, with a raising of both arms.\r\n\r\n\"I have spoken truth! Now answer!\"\r\n\r\nHe ceased, and for a short minute there was silence. Then spoke\r\nVreenya:\r\n\r\n\"O Kromno, master! We would question you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will answer and say only the thing that is.\"\r\n\r\n\"First, can our people live in that other, lighter air?\"\r\n\r\n\"They can live. We have prepared caves for you. At first you shall not\r\nsee the light. Only little by little you shall see it, and you and\r\nyour children will change, till at last you shall be as I am and as\r\nyour people were in the old days!\"\r\n\r\nVreenya pondered, while tense interest held the elders and the Folk.\r\nThen he nodded, for his understanding--like that of all--was keen in\r\nspite of his savagery.\r\n\r\n\"And we can eat, O Kromno? This flesh off beasts you speak of may be\r\ngood. This strange fruit may be good. I know not. It may also be as\r\nthe poison weeds of our sea to us. But, if so, there are fish in those\r\nwaters of the upper world?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are fish, Vreenya, and of the best, and many! Near the caves\r\nruns a river--\"\r\n\r\n\"A what, master?\"\r\n\r\n\"A going of the waters. In those waters live fish without number. At\r\nthe dark times you can catch them with nets, even as here. The dark\r\ntimes are half of each day. You shall have many hours for the fishing.\r\nEven that will suffice to live; but the flesh and fruits will not hurt\r\nyou. They are good. There will be food for all, and far more than\r\nenough for all!\"\r\n\r\nVreenya pondered again.\r\n\r\n\"We would talk together, we elders,\" he said, simply.\r\n\r\n\"It meets my pleasure,\" answered Allan. \"And when ye have talked, I\r\ndesire your answer!\"\r\n\r\nHe crossed his arms, faced the multitude, and waited, while the elders\r\ngathered in a little group by the dungeon and for some minutes\r\nconferred in low and earnest tones.\r\n\r\nOutwardly, the man seemed calm, but his soul burned within him and his\r\nheart was racing violently.\r\n\r\nFor on this moment, he well knew, hung the world's destiny. Should\r\nthey decide to venture forth into the outer world all would be well.\r\nIf not, the long labor, the plans, the hopes were lost forever.\r\n\r\nWell he knew the stubborn nature of the Folk. Once their minds set,\r\nnothing on earth could ever stir them.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God I managed that lie about the patriarch!\" thought Allen\r\nquickly. \"If I'd slipped up on that, and told them he died at the very\r\nminute the sunlight struck him, it would have been all off, world\r\nwithout end. Hope it doesn't make a row later. But if it does, I'll\r\nface it. The main and only thing now is to get 'em started. They've\r\n_got_ to go, that's all there is about it.\r\n\r\n\"Gad! After all, it's a terrific proposition I'm putting up to these\r\nsimple fishers of the Abyss. I'm asking them, just on my say-so, to\r\nroot up the life, the habits, the traditions of more than a thousand\r\nyears and make a leap into the dark--into the light, I mean.\r\n\r\n\"I'm asking them to leave everything they've ever known for thirty\r\ngenerations and take a chance on what to them must be the wildest and\r\nmost hare-brained adventure possible to imagine. To risk homes,\r\nfamilies, lives, everything, just on my unsupported word. Jove!\r\nColumbus's proposal to his men was a mere afternoon jaunt compared\r\nwith _this!_ If they refuse, how can I blame them? But if they\r\naccept--God! what stuff I'll know they're made of! With material like\r\nthat to work with, the conquest of the world's in sight already.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes, wandering nervously along the front ranks of the waiting\r\nFolk, dimly illumined by the dull blue glow of the fire-well that\r\nshone through the mist, suddenly stopped with apprehension. His brows\r\ncontracted, and on his heart it seemed as though a gripping hand had\r\nsuddenly laid hold.\r\n\r\n\"H'yemba, the smith, again! Damn him! H'yemba!\" he muttered, in sudden\r\nanger strongly tinged with fear.\r\n\r\nThe smith, in fact, was standing there a little to the left of him,\r\nhuge and sinewed hands loosely clasped in front of him, face sinister,\r\neyes glowing like two malevolent evil fires.\r\n\r\nAllan noted the defiant poise of the body, the vast breadth of the\r\nshoulders, the heavy hang of the arms, biceped like a gorilla's.\r\n\r\nFor a minute the two men looked each other steadfastly in the eye,\r\neach measuring the other. Then suddenly the voice of Vreenya broke the\r\ntension.\r\n\r\n\"O Kromno, we have spoken. Will you hear us?\"\r\n\r\nStern faced him, a strange sinking at his heart, almost as though the\r\nforeman of a jury stood before him to announce either freedom or\r\nsentence of death.\r\n\r\nBut, holding himself in check, lest any sign of fear or nervousness\r\nbetray him, he made answer:\r\n\r\n\"I will hear you. Speak!\"\r\n\r\n\"We have listened to your words. We believe you speak truth. Yet--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet _what?_ Out with it, man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet will we not compel any man to go. All shall be free--\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" breathed Allan, with a mighty sigh.\r\n\r\n\"--Free to stay or go, as they will. Our village is too full, even\r\nnow. We have many children. It were well that some should make room\r\nfor others. Those who dare, have our consent. Now, speak _you_ to the\r\npeople, your people, O Kromno, and see who chooses the upper world\r\nwith you!\"\r\n\r\nOnce more Allan turned toward the assemblage. But before he had found\r\ntime to frame the first question in this unfamiliar speech, a\r\ndisturbance somewhat to the left interrupted him.\r\n\r\nThere came a jostling, a pushing, a sound of voices in amazement,\r\nanger, approbation, doubt.\r\n\r\nInto the clear space stepped H'yemba, the smith. His powerful right\r\nhand he raised on high. And boldly, in a loud voice, he cried:\r\n\r\n\"Folk of the Merucaans, this cannot be!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE RAVISHED NEST\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be? Who says it cannot be? _Who dares stand out and\r\nchallenge me?_\"\r\n\r\n\"I, H'yemba, the man of iron and of flame!\"\r\n\r\nStern faced him, every nerve and fiber quivering with sudden passion.\r\nAt realization that in the exact psychological moment when success lay\r\nalmost in his hand, this surly brute might baffle him, he felt a wave\r\nof murderous hate.\r\n\r\nHe realized that the dreaded catastrophe had indeed come to pass. Now\r\nhis sole claim to chieftainship lay in his power to defend the title.\r\nFailure meant--death.\r\n\r\n\"You?\" he shouted, advancing on the smith.\r\n\r\nHis opponent only leered and grimaced offensively. Then without even\r\nhaving vouchsafed an answer, he swung toward the elders.\r\n\r\n\"I challenge!\" he exclaimed. \"I have the right of words!\"\r\n\r\nVreenya nodded, fingering his long white beard.\r\n\r\n\"Speak on!\" he answered. \"Such is our ancient custom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, people,\" cried the smith, suddenly facing the throng, \"will ye\r\nfollow one who breaks the tribal manners of our folk? One who disdains\r\nour law? Who has neglected to obey it? Will ye trust yourselves into\r\nhands stained with law-breaking of our blood?\"\r\n\r\nA murmur, doubtful, wondering, obscure, spread through the people. By\r\nthe greenish flare-light Stern could see looks of wonder and dismay.\r\nSome frowned, others stared at him or at the smith, and many muttered.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil and all have I broken _now?_\" wondered Allan. \"Plague\r\ntake these barbarous customs! Jove, they're worse than the taboos of\r\nthe old Maoris, in the ancient days! What's up?\"\r\n\r\nHe had not long to wonder, for of a sudden H'yemba wheeled on him,\r\npointed him out with vibrant hands, and in a voice of terrible anger\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n\"The law, the law of old! No man shall be chief who does not take a\r\nwife from out our people! None who weds one of the Lanskaarn, the\r\nisland folk, or the yellow-haired Skeri beyond the Vortex, none such\r\nshall ever rule us. Yet this man, this stranger who speaks such great\r\nthings very hard to be believed, scorns our custom. No woman from\r\namong us he has taken, but instead, that vuedma of his own kind!\r\nWhat? Will ye--\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke no further, for Allan was upon him with one leap. At sound of\r\nthat word, the most injurious in their tongue, the fires of Hell burst\r\nloose in Stern.\r\n\r\nReckoning no consequences, staying for no parley or diplomacy, he\r\nsprang; and as he sprang, he struck.\r\n\r\nThe blow went home on the smith's jaw with a smash like a pile-driver.\r\nH'yemba, reeling, swung at him--no skill, no science, just a wild,\r\nbarbaric, sledge-hammer sweep.\r\n\r\nIt would have killed had it landed, but Allan was not there. In point\r\nof tactics, the twentieth century met the tenth.\r\n\r\nAnd as the smith whirled to recover, a terrible left-hander met him\r\njust below the short ribs.\r\n\r\nWith a grunt the man doubled, sprawled and fell. By some strange\r\natavism, which he never afterward could understand, Allan counted, in\r\nthe Folk's tongue: \"Hathi, ko, zem, baku\" and so up to \"lamnu\"--ten.\r\n\r\nStill the smith did not rise, but only lay and groaned and sought to\r\ncatch the breath that would not come.\r\n\r\n\"I have won!\" cried Allan in a loud voice. \"Here, you people, take\r\nthis greun, this child, away! And let there be no further idle talk\r\nof a dead law--for surely, in your custom, a law dies when its\r\nchampion is beaten! Come, quick, away with him!\"\r\n\r\nTwo stout men came forward, bowed to Allan with hands clasped upon\r\ntheir breasts in signal of fresh allegiance, and without ceremony took\r\nthe insensible smith, neck-and-heels, and lugged him off as though he\r\nhad only been a net heavily laden with fish.\r\n\r\nThe crowd opened in awed silence to let them pass. By the glare Allan\r\nnoticed that the man's jaw hung oddly awry, even as the obeah's had\r\nhung, in Madison Forest.\r\n\r\n\"Jove, what a wallop that must have been!\" thought he, now perceiving\r\nfor the first time that his knuckles were cut and bleeding. \"Old\r\nMonahan himself taught me that in the Harvard gym a thousand odd years\r\nago--and it still works. _One_ question settled, mighty quick; and\r\nH'yemba won't have much to say for a few weeks at least. Not till his\r\njawbone knits again, anyhow!\"\r\n\r\nUpon his arm he felt a hand. Turning, he saw Vreenya, the aged\r\ncounselor.\r\n\r\n\"Surely, O master, he shall not live, now you have conquered him? The\r\nboiling pit awaits. It is our custom--if you will!\"\r\n\r\nAllan only shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"All customs change, these times,\" he answered. \"_I_ am your law! This\r\nman's life is needed, for he has good skill with metals. He shall\r\nlive, but never shall he speak before the Folk again. I have said it!\"\r\n\r\nTo the waiting throng he turned again.\r\n\r\n\"Ye have witnessed!\" he cried, in a loud voice. \"Now, have fear of me,\r\nyour master! Once in the Battle of the Walls ye beheld death raining\r\nfrom my fire-bow. Once ye watched me vanquish your ruler, even the\r\ngreat Kamrou himself, and fling him far into the pit that boils. And\r\nnow, for the third time, ye have seen. Remember well!\"\r\n\r\nA stir ran through the multitude. He felt its potent meaning, and he\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n\"I am the law!\" he flung at them once more. \"Declare it, all! Repeat!\"\r\n\r\nThe thousand-throated chorus: \"_Thou art the law!_\" boomed upward\r\nthrough the fog, rolled mightily against the towering cliff, and\r\nechoed thunderlike across the hot, black sea.\r\n\r\n\"It is well!\" he cried. \"One more sleep, and then--then I choose from\r\namong ye two for the journey, two of your boldest and best. And that\r\nshall be the first journey of many, up to the better places that await\r\nye, far beyond the pit!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nStraining his eyes in the night, pierced only\r\nby the electric beam that ran and quavered rapidly over the broken\r\nforest-tops far below, Allan peered down and far ahead. The fire, the\r\nsignal-fire he had told Beatrice to build upon the ledge--would he\r\nnever sight it?\r\n\r\nEagerly he scanned the dark horizon only just visible in the\r\nstar-shine. Warmly the rushing night wind fanned his cheek; the roar\r\nof the motor and propellers, pulsating mightily, made music to his\r\nears. For it sang: \"Home again! Beatrice, and love once more!\"\r\n\r\nMany long hours had passed since, his fuel-tanks replenished from the\r\napparatus for distilling the crude naphtha, which he had installed\r\nduring his first stay in the Abyss, he had risen a second time into\r\nthat heavy, humid, purple-vapored air.\r\n\r\nWith him he now bore Bremilu, the strong, and Zangamon, most expert of\r\nall the fishermen. Slung in the baggage-crate aft lay a large seine,\r\ncertain supplies of fish, weed and eggs, and--from time to time\r\nnoisily squawking--some half-dozen of the strange sea-birds, in a\r\nmetal basket.\r\n\r\nThe pioneers had insisted on taking these impedimenta with them, to\r\nbridge the gap of changed conditions, a precaution Stern had\r\nrecognized as eminently sensible.\r\n\r\n\"Gad!\" thought he, as the Pauillac swept its long, flat-arc'd\r\ntrajectory through the night, \"under any circumstances this must be a\r\nterrific wrench for them. Talk about nerve! If _they_ haven't got it,\r\nwho has? This trip of these subterranean barbarians, thus flung\r\nsuddenly into midair, out into a world of which they know absolutely\r\nnothing, must be exactly what a journey to Mars would mean to me.\r\nMore, far more, to their simple minds. I wonder myself at their\r\ncourage in taking such a tremendous step.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in his heart a new and keener admiration for the basic stamina of\r\nthe Merucaans took root.\r\n\r\n\"They'll do!\" he murmured, as he scanned his lighted chart once more,\r\nand cast up reckonings from the dials of his delicately adjusted\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour more of rapid flight and he deemed New Hope River could\r\nnot now be far.\r\n\r\n\"No use to try and hear it, though, with this racket of the propellers\r\nin my ears,\" thought he. \"The searchlight might possibly pick up a\r\ngleam of water, if we fly over it. But even that's a small index to go\r\nby. The signal-fire must be my only real guide--and where is it, now,\r\nthat fire?\"\r\n\r\nA vague uneasiness began to oppress him. The fire, he reckoned, should\r\nhave shown ere now in the far distance. Without it, how find his way?\r\nAnd what of Beatrice?\r\n\r\nHis uneasy reflections were suddenly interrupted by a word from\r\nZangamon, at his right.\r\n\r\n\"O Kromno, master, see?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"A fire, very distant, master!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" queried Stern eagerly, his heart leaping with joy. \"I see no\r\nfire. Your eyes, used to the dark places and the fogs, now far surpass\r\nmine, even as mine will yours when the time of light shall come. Where\r\nis the fire, Zangamon?\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher pointed, a dim huge figure in the star-lit gloom. \"There,\r\nmaster. On thy left hand, thus.\"\r\n\r\nStern shifted his course to southwest by west, and for some minutes\r\nheld it true, so that the needle hardly trembled on the compass dial.\r\n\r\nThen all at once he, too, saw the welcome signal, a tiniest pin-prick\r\nof light far on the edge of the world, no different from the\r\nsixth-magnitude stars that hung just above it on the horizon, save for\r\nits redness.\r\n\r\nA gush of gratitude and love welled in the fountains of his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Home!\" he whispered. \"Home--for where _you_ are that's home to me!\r\nOh, Beatrice, I'm coming--coming home to you!\"\r\n\r\nSlowly at first, then with greater and ever greater swiftness, the\r\nsignal star crept nearer; and now even the flames were visible, and\r\nnow behind them he caught dim sight of the rock-wall.\r\n\r\nOn and on, a very vulture of the upper air, planed the Pauillac. Stern\r\nshouted with all his strength. The girl might possibly hear him and\r\nmight come out of their cave. She might even signal--and the nearness\r\nof her presence mounted upon him like a heady wine.\r\n\r\nHe swung the searchlight on the canyon, as they swept above it. He\r\nflung the pencil of radiance in a wide sweep up the cliff and down\r\nalong the terrace.\r\n\r\nIt gave no sight, no sign of Beatrice.\r\n\r\n\"Sleeping, of course,\" he reflected.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Hope River past, and the canyon swallowed by the dense\r\nforest, he flung his light once more ahead. With it he felt out the\r\nrocky barrens for a landing-place.\r\n\r\nNot more than twenty minutes later, followed by Bremilu and Zangamon,\r\nStern was making way through the thick-laced wood and jungle.\r\n\r\nAwed, terrified by their first sight of trees and by the upper world\r\nwhich to them was naught but marvel and danger, the two Merucaans\r\nfollowed close behind their guide. Even so would you or I cling to the\r\nMartian who should land us on that ruddy planet and pilot us through\r\nsome huge, inchoate and grotesque growth of things to us perfectly\r\nunimaginable.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, master, we shall see the patriarch soon?\" asked Bremilu, in a\r\nstrange voice--a voice to him astonishingly loud, in the clear air of\r\nnight upon the surface of the world. \"Soon shall we speak with him\r\nand--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hark! What's that?\" interrupted Stern, pausing, the while he gripped\r\nhis pistol tighter.\r\n\r\nFrom afar, though in which direction he could not say, a vague, dull\r\nroar made itself heard through the forest.\r\n\r\nSonorous, vibrant, menacing, it echoed and died; and then again, as\r\nonce before, Stern heard that strange, hollow booming, as of some\r\nmighty drum struck by a muffled fist.\r\n\r\nA cry? Was that a cry, so distant and so faint? Beast-cry, or call of\r\nnight-bird, shrill and far?\r\n\r\nStern shuddered, and with redoubled haste once more pushed through the\r\nvague path he and Beatrice had made from the barrens to Settlement\r\nMiffs.\r\n\r\nPresently, followed by the two colonists who dared not let him for a\r\nmoment out of their sight, he reached the brow of the canyon. His hand\r\nflash-lamp showed him the rough path to the terrace.\r\n\r\nWith fast-beating heart he ran down it, unmindful of the unprotected\r\nedge or the sheer drop to the rocks of New Hope River, far below.\r\n\r\nBremilu and Zangamon, seeing perfectly in the gloom, hurried close\r\nbehind, with words of awe, wonder and admiration in their own tongue.\r\n\r\n\"Beta! Oh, Beatrice! Home again!\" Stern shouted triumphantly. \"Where\r\nare you, Beta? Come! I'm home again!\"\r\n\r\nQuickly he scrambled along the broken terrace, stumbling in his haste\r\nover loose rocks and debris. Now he had reached the turn. The fire was\r\nin sight.\r\n\r\n\"Beta!\" again he hailed. \"O-he! Beatrice!\"\r\n\r\nStill no answer, nor any sign from her. As he came to the fire he\r\nnoted, despite his strong emotions, that it had for the most part\r\nburned down to glowing embers.\r\n\r\nOnly one or two resinous knots still flamed. It could not have been\r\nreplenished for some time, perhaps two hours or more.\r\n\r\nAgain, his quick eye caught the fact that cinders, ashes and\r\nhalf-burned sticks lay scattered about in strange disorder.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Beatrice never makes a fire like that!\" the thought pierced\r\nthrough his mind.\r\n\r\nAnd--though as yet on no very definite grounds--a quick prescience of\r\ncatastrophe battered at his heart.\r\n\r\n\"What's _this?_\"\r\n\r\nSomething lying on the rock-ledge, near the fire, caught his eye. He\r\nsnatched it up.\r\n\r\n\"What--what can _this_ mean?\"\r\n\r\nThe colonists stood, frightened and confused, peering at him in the\r\ndark. His face, in the ruddy fire-glow, as he studied the thing he now\r\nheld in his hand, must have been very terrible.\r\n\r\n\"_Cloth!_ Torn! But--but _then_--\"\r\n\r\nHe flung from him the bit of the girl's cloak which, ripped and\r\nshredded as though by a powerful hand, cried disaster.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice!\" he shouted. \"Where are you? Beatrice!\"\r\n\r\nTo the doorway in the cliff he ran, shaken and trembling.\r\n\r\nThe stone had been pushed away; it lay inside the cave. Ominously the\r\nblack entrance seemed staring at him in the dull gleam of the\r\nfirelight.\r\n\r\nOn hands and knees he fell, and hastily crawled through. As he went,\r\nhe flashed his lamp here, there, everywhere.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! _Beatrice!_\"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nIn the far corner still flickered some remainder of the cooking-fire.\r\nBut there, too, ashes and half-burned sticks lay scattered all about.\r\n\r\nTo the bed he ran. It was empty and cold.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! Oh, my God!\"\r\n\r\nA glint of something metallic on the floor drew his bewildered,\r\nterror-smitten gaze.\r\n\r\nHe sprang, seized the object, and for a moment stood staring, while\r\nall about him the very universe seemed thundering and crashing down.\r\n\r\nThe object in his hand was the girl's gun. One cartridge, and only\r\none, had been exploded.\r\n\r\nThe barrel had been twisted almost off, as though by the wrenching\r\nclutch of a hand inhuman in its ghastly power.\r\n\r\nOn the stock, distinctly nicked into the hard rubber as Stern held the\r\nflash-lamp to it, were the unmistakable imprints of teeth.\r\n\r\nWith a groan, Allan started backward. The revolver fell with a clatter\r\nto the cave floor.\r\n\r\nHis foot slid in something wet, something sticky.\r\n\r\n\"_Blood!_\" he gasped.\r\n\r\nHalf-crazed, he reeled toward the door.\r\n\r\nThe flash-lamp in his hand flung its white brush of radiance along the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nWith a chattering cry he recoiled.\r\n\r\nThere, roughly yet unmistakably imprinted on the white limestone\r\nsurface, he saw the print, in crimson, of a huge, a horrible, a\r\nbrutally distorted hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nON THE TRAIL OF THE MONSTER\r\n\r\n\r\nStern's cry of horror as he scrambled from the ravaged,\r\ndesecrated cave, and the ghastly horror of his face, seen by the\r\nfirelight, brought Zangamon and Bremilu to him, in terror.\r\n\r\n\"Master! Master! What--\"\r\n\r\n\"My God! The girl--she's gone!\" he stammered, leaning against the\r\ncliff in mortal anguish.\r\n\r\n\"Gone, master? Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone! Dead, perhaps! Find her for me! Find her! You can see--in the\r\ndark! I--I am as though blind! Quick, on the trail!\"\r\n\r\n\"But tell us--\"\r\n\r\n\"Something has taken her! Some savage thing! Some wild man! Even now\r\nhe may be killing her! _Quick--after them!_\"\r\n\r\nBremilu stood staring for a moment, unable to grasp this catastrophe\r\non the very moment of arrival. But Zangamon, of swifter wit, had\r\nalready fallen on his knees, there by the mouth of the cave, and\r\nnow--seeing clearly by the dim light which more than sufficed for\r\nhim--was studying the traces of the struggle.\r\n\r\nStern, meanwhile, clutching his head between both hands, dumb-mad with\r\nagony, was choking with dry sobs.\r\n\r\n\"Master! See!\"\r\n\r\nZangamon held up a piece of splintered wood, with the bark deeply\r\nscarred by teeth.\r\n\r\nStern snatched it.\r\n\r\n\"Part of the pole I gave her to brace the rock with,\" he realized.\r\n\"Even that was of no avail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Master--this way they went!\"\r\n\r\nZangamon pointed up along the rock-terrace. Stern's eyes could\r\ndistinguish no slightest trace on the stone, but the Merucaan spoke\r\nwith certainty. He added:\r\n\r\n\"There was fighting, all the way along here, master. And then, here,\r\nthe girl was dragged.\"\r\n\r\nStern stumbled blindly after him as he led the way.\r\n\r\n\"There was fighting here? She struggled?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God! She was alive here, anyhow! She wasn't killed in the cave.\r\nMaybe, in the open, she might--\"\r\n\r\n\"Now there is no more fighting, master. The wild thing carried her\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed at the rock. Stern, trembling and very sick, flashed his\r\nelectric-lamp upon it. With eyes of dread and horror he looked for\r\nblood-stains.\r\n\r\nWhat? A drop! With a dull, shuddering groan, he pressed forward again.\r\n\r\nOut he jerked his pistol and fired, straight up, their prearranged\r\nsignal: One shot, then a pause, then two. Some bare possibility\r\nexisted and that she still might live and hear and know that rescue\r\ncame--if it could come before it were eternally too late!\r\n\r\n\"On, on!\" cried Allan. \"Go on, Zangamon! Quick! Lead me on the trail!\"\r\n\r\nThe Merucaan, now aided by Bremilu, who had recovered his wits,\r\nscouted ahead like a blood-hound on the spoor of a fugitive. One\r\ngripped his stone ax, the other a javelin.\r\n\r\nBent half double, scrutinizing in the dark the stony path which Allan\r\nfollowed behind them only by the aid of his flash, they proceeded\r\ncautiously up toward the brow of the cliff again.\r\n\r\nBut ere they reached the top they branched off onto another lateral\r\npath, still rougher and more tortuous, that led along the breast of\r\nthe canyon.\r\n\r\n\"This way, master. It was here, most surely, the thing carried her.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of marks? Do you see signs of claws?\"\r\n\r\n\"Claws? What are claws?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sharp, long nails, like our nails, only much larger and longer. Do\r\nyou see any such marks?\"\r\n\r\nZangamon paused a second to peer.\r\n\r\n\"I seem to see marks as of hands, master, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter! On! We must find her! Quick--lead the way!\"\r\n\r\nFive minutes of agonizing suspense for Allan brought him, still\r\nfollowing the guides, without whom all would have been utterly lost,\r\nto a kind of thickly wooded dell that descended sharply to the edge of\r\nthe canyon. Into this the trail led.\r\n\r\nEven he himself could now here and there make out, by the aid of his\r\nlight, a broken twig, trampled ferns and down-crushed grass. Once he\r\ndistinguished a blood-stain on a limb--fresh blood, not coagulated. A\r\ngroan burst from between his chattering teeth.\r\n\r\nHe turned his light on the grass beneath. All at once a blade moved.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank God!\" he wheezed. \"They passed here only a few minutes ago.\r\nThey can't be far now!\"\r\n\r\nSomething drew his attention. He snatched at a sapling.\r\n\r\n\"Hair!\"\r\n\r\nCaught in a roughness of the bark a few short, stiff, wiry hairs,\r\nreddish-brown, were twisted.\r\n\r\n\"_One of the Horde?_\" he stammered.\r\n\r\nA lightning-flash of memory carried him back to Madison Forest, more\r\nthan a year ago. He seemed to see again the obeah, as that monster\r\nadvanced upon the girl, clutching, supremely hideous.\r\n\r\n\"The hair! The same kind of hair! In the power of the Horde!\" he\r\ngasped.\r\n\r\nA mental picture of extermination flashed before his mind's eye.\r\nWhether the girl lived or died, he knew now that his life work was to\r\ninclude a total slaughter of the Anthropoids. The destruction he had\r\nalready wrought among them was but child's play to what would be.\r\n\r\nAnd in his soul flamed the foreknowledge of a hunt a\r\nl'outrance, to the bitter end. So long as one, a single one of that\r\nfoul breed should live, he would not rest from killing.\r\n\r\n\"Master! This way! Here, master!\"\r\n\r\nThe voice of Zangamon sent him once more crashing through the jungle,\r\nafter his questing guides. Again he fired the signal-shot, and now\r\nwith the full power of his lungs he yelled.\r\n\r\nHis voice rang, echoing, through the black and tangled growths,\r\nstartling the night-life of the depths. Something chippered overhead.\r\nNear-by a serpent slid away, hissing venomously. Death lurked on every\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nStern took no thought of it, but pressed forward, shouting the girl's\r\nname, hallooing, beating down the undergrowth with mad fury. And here,\r\nthere, all about he flung the light-beam.\r\n\r\nPerhaps she might yet hear his hails; perhaps she might even catch\r\nsome distant glimmer of his light, and know that help was coming, that\r\nrescuers were fighting onward to her.\r\n\r\nSilent, lithe, confident even among these new and terribly strange\r\nconditions, the two men of the Folk slid through the jungle.\r\n\r\nNo hounds ever trailed fugitive more surely and with greater skill\r\nthan these strange, white barbarians from the underworld. Through all\r\nhis fear and agony, Stern blessed their courage and their skill.\r\n\r\n\"Men, by God! They're _men!_\" he muttered, as he thrashed his painful\r\nway behind them in the night.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden, there somewhere ahead, far ahead in the wilderness--a\r\ncry?\r\n\r\nAllan stopped short, his heart leaping.\r\n\r\nAgain he fired, and his voice set all the echoes ringing.\r\n\r\nA cry! He knew it now. There could be no mistake--_a cry!_\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice!\" he shouted in a terrible voice, leaping forward. The\r\nguides broke into a crouching run. All three crashed through the\r\nthickets, split the fern-masses, struggled through the tall\r\nsaber-grass that here and there rose higher than their heads.\r\n\r\nAllan cursed himself for a fool. That other cry he had heard while on\r\nhis way from the Pauillac to Settlement Cliffs--that had been her cry\r\nfor help--and he had neither known nor heeded.\r\n\r\n\"Fool that I was! Oh, damnable idiot that I was!\" he panted as he ran.\r\n\r\nFrom moment to moment he fired. He paused a few seconds to jack a\r\nfresh cartridge-clip into the automatic.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God I've got a belt full of ammunition!\" thought he, and again\r\nsmashed along with the two Merucaans.\r\n\r\nAll at once a formidable roar gave them pause.\r\n\r\nHollow, booming, deep, yet rising to a wild shriek of rage and horrid\r\nbrutality, the beast-cry flung itself through the jungle.\r\n\r\nAnd, following it, they heard again that muffled drumming, as though\r\ngigantic fists were flailing a tremendous tambour in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Master!\" whispered Zangamon, recoiling a step. \"Oh, Kromno, what is\r\n_that?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Never have we heard such in our place!\" added Bremilu, gripping his\r\nax the tighter. \"Is that a man-cry, or the cry of a beast--one of the\r\nbeasts you told us of, that we have never seen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both! A man-beast! Kill! Kill!\"\r\n\r\nNow, Allan, sure of his direction, took the lead. No longer he flashed\r\nthe light, and only once more he called:\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! O Beatrice! We're coming!\"\r\n\r\nAgain he heard her cry, but suddenly it died as though swiftly choked\r\nin her very throat. Allan spat a blasphemy and surged on.\r\n\r\nThe two white barbarians followed, peering with those strange, pinkish\r\neyes of theirs, courageous still, yet utterly at a loss to know what\r\nmanner of thing they were now drawing near.\r\n\r\nThey burst through a thicket, waded a marshy swale and went splashing,\r\nstaggering and slipping among tufts of coarse and knife-edged grasses,\r\nthe haunt of unknown venomous reptiles.\r\n\r\nUp a slope they won; and now, all at once the roar burst forth again\r\nclose at hand, a rending tumult, wild, earthshaking, inexpressibly\r\nterrible.\r\n\r\nAll three stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! Are you there? Answer!\" shouted Stern.\r\n\r\nSilence, save for a peculiar mumbling snuffle off ahead, among the\r\ndeeper shadows of a fern-tree thicket.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice!\"\r\n\r\nNo answer. With a groan Allan shot his light toward the thicket. He\r\nseemed to distinguish something moving. To his ears now came a sound\r\nof twigs and brushwood snapping.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely void of fear he pressed forward, and the two colonists with\r\nhim, their weapons ready. Stern held his revolver poised for instant\r\naction. His heart was hammering, and his breath surged pantingly; but\r\nwithin him his consciousness and soul lay calm.\r\n\r\nFor he knew one of two things were now to happen. Either that beast\r\nahead there in the gloom, or he, must die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nIN THE GRIP OF TERROR\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the three pursuers steadily advanced, the thing roared once\r\nmore, and again they heard the hammering, drumming boom. Zangamon\r\nwhispered some unintelligible phrase.\r\n\r\nAllan projected the light forward again, and at sight of a moving\r\nmass, vague and intangible, among the gigantic fronds, leveled his\r\nautomatic.\r\n\r\nBut on the instant Bremilu seized his arm.\r\n\r\n\"O master! Do not throw the fire of death!\" he warned. \"You cannot\r\nsee, but we can! Do not throw the fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? What _is_ that thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems a man, yet it is different, master. It is all hair, and very\r\nthick and strong, and hideous! Do not shoot, O Kromno!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Behold! That strange man-thing holds the woman, Beatrice, in his left\r\narm. Of a truth, you may kill her, and not the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nAllan steadied himself against a palm. His brain seemed whirling, and\r\nfor a moment all grew vague and like a dream.\r\n\r\nShe was there--Beatrice was there, and they could see her. There, in\r\nthe clutches of some monster, horrible and foul! Living yet? _Dead?_\r\n\r\n\"Tell me! Does she live?\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot say, O Kromno. But do not shoot. We will creep close--we,\r\nourselves, will slay, and never touch the woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! If you do he'll strangle her--provided she still lives! Don't\r\ngo! Wait! Let me think a second.\"\r\n\r\nWith a tremendous effort Allan mastered himself. The situation far\r\nsurpassed, in horror, any he had ever known.\r\n\r\nThere not a hundred yards distant in the dense blackness was Beatrice,\r\nin the grip of some unknown and hideous creature. Advance, Allan dared\r\nnot, lest the creature rend her to tatters. Shoot, he dared not.\r\n\r\nYet something must be done, and quickly, for every second, every\r\nfraction of a second, was golden. The merest accident might now mean\r\ndeath or life--life, if the girl still lived!\r\n\r\n\"Zangamon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yea, master?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be very bold! Do my bidding!\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak only the word, Kromno, and I obey!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go you, then, very quietly, very swiftly, to the other side of these\r\ngreat growing things--these trees, we call them. Then call, so that\r\nthis thing shall turn toward you. Thus, I may shoot, and perhaps not\r\nkill the woman. It is the only way!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear, master. I go!\"\r\n\r\nAllan and Bremilu waited, while from the thicket came, at intervals,\r\nthe savage snuffling, with now and then a grumbling mutter.\r\n\r\nAll at once a call sounded from far ahead.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" commanded Allan. Together he and Bremilu crept through the\r\njungle toward the thicket.\r\n\r\nWide-eyed, yet seeing almost nothing, Allan crawled noiselessly,\r\nautomatic in hand. The Merucaan slid along, silent as an Apache.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me if you see the thing again--if you see it turn!\" whispered\r\nStern. \"Tell me, for you can see.\"\r\n\r\nNow the distance was cut in half; now only a third of it remained.\r\nBefore Stern it seemed a fathomless pit of black was opening. Under\r\nthe close-woven arches of the giant fern-trees the night was\r\nimpenetrable.\r\n\r\nAnd as yet he dared not dart the light-beam into that pit of darkness,\r\nfor fear of precipitating an unthinkable tragedy--if, indeed, the\r\nhorror had not already been cons summated.\r\n\r\nBut now Bremilu gripped his arm. Afar, on the other side of the\r\nthicket, they heard a singular commotion, cries, shouts, and the\r\nvigorous beating of the fern-trees.\r\n\r\n\"The thing has turned, master!\" the Merucaan exclaimed, at Allan's\r\nside. \"Now throw the fire-death! Etvur! Quickly, throw!\"\r\n\r\nStern swept the thicket with his beam.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! There--_there!_\"\r\n\r\nThe light caught a moving, hairy mass of brown--a huge, squat,\r\nterrible creature, its back now toward them. At one side Stern saw a\r\nvague blackness--the long, unbound hair of Beatrice!\r\n\r\nHe glimpsed a white arm dangling limp; and in his breast the heart\r\nflamed at white-heat of rage and passion.\r\n\r\nBut his hand was steel. Never in his life had he drawn so fine a bead.\r\n\r\n\"Hold the light for me!\" he whispered, passing it to his companion. \"I\r\nwant both hands for this!\"\r\n\r\nBremilu held the beam true, blinking strangely with his pink eyes.\r\nStern, resting his pistol hand in the hollow of his left elbow,\r\nsighted true.\r\n\r\nA fraction of a hair to the left, and the bullet might crash through\r\nthe brain of Beatrice!\r\n\r\n\"Oh, God--if there be any God--speed the shot true--\" he prayed, and\r\nfired.\r\n\r\nA hideous yell, ripping the night to shreds, burst in a raw and rising\r\ndiscord through the forest--a scream as of a damned soul flung upon\r\nthe brimstone.\r\n\r\nThen, as he glimpsed the white arm falling and knew the thing had\r\nloosed its grip, the light died. Bremilu, starting at the sudden\r\ndischarge close to his ear, had pressed the ivory button.\r\n\r\nStern snatched for the flash-lamp, fumbled it, and dropped it there\r\namong the lush growths underfoot.\r\n\r\nBefore he could more than stoop to feel for it a heavy crash through\r\nthe wood told that the thing was charging.\r\n\r\nWith bubbling yells it came, trampling the undergrowth, drumming on\r\nits huge breast, gibbeting with demoniac rage and pain--came swiftly,\r\nlike the terrific things that people nightmares.\r\n\r\nBehind it, shouts echoed. Stern heard the voice of Zangamon as, spear\r\nin hand, the Merucaan pursued.\r\n\r\nHe raised his revolver once more, but dared not fire.\r\n\r\nYet only an instant he hesitated, in the fear of killing Zangamon.\r\n\r\nFor, quick-looming through the darkness, a huge bulk, panting,\r\nsnarling, chattering, sprang--an avalanche of muscle, bone, fur, mad\r\nwith murder--rage.\r\n\r\n_Crack!_ spoke the automatic, point-blank at this rushing horror, this\r\nblacker shadow in the blackness.\r\n\r\nThe fire-stab revealed a grinning white-fanged face close to his own,\r\nand clutching hands, and terrible, thick, hairy arms.\r\n\r\nThen something hurled itself on Stern; something bore him\r\nbackward--something beside which his strength was as a\r\nbaby's--something vast, irresistible, hideous beyond all telling.\r\n\r\nStern felt the flesh of his left arm ripped up. Crushed, doubled,\r\nimpotent, he fell.\r\n\r\nAnd at his throat long fingers clutched. A fetid, stinking breath\r\ngushed hot upon his face. He heard the raving chatter of ivories,\r\nsnapping to rend him.\r\n\r\nUp sprang another shadow. High it swung a weapon. The blow thudded\r\nhollow, smashing, annihilating.\r\n\r\nHot liquid gushed over Allan's hand as he sought to beat the monster\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThen, fair upon him, fell a crushing weight.\r\n\r\nSwooning, he knew no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nA RESPITE FROM TOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bright beam of the flash-lamp in his face roused Allan to a\r\nconsciousness that he was bruised and suffering, and that his left arm\r\nached with dull insistence. Dazed, he brought it up and saw his sleeve\r\nof dull brown stuff was dripping red.\r\n\r\nBeside him, in the trampled grass, he vaguely made out a hairy bulk,\r\nmotionless and huge. Bremilu was kneeling beside his master, with\r\nwords of cheer.\r\n\r\n\"It is dead, O Kromno! The man-beast is dead! My stone ax broke its\r\nskull. See, now it lies here harmless!\"\r\n\r\nThe currents of thought began to flow once more. Allan struggled up,\r\nunmindful of his wounds.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! _Where is the girl?_\" he gasped.\r\n\r\nAs though by way of answer, the tall growths swayed and crackled, and\r\nthrough them a dim figure loomed--a man with something in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Zangamon!\" panted Allan, springing toward him. \"Have you got her? The\r\ngirl--is she alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"She lives, master!\" replied a voice. \"But as yet she remains without\r\nknowledge of aught.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wounded? Is she wounded?\"\r\n\r\nAlready he had reached Zangamon, and, injured though he was, had taken\r\nthe beloved form in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! Beatrice!\" he called, pressing kisses to her brow, her\r\neyes, her mouth--still warm, thank God!\r\n\r\nHe sank down among the underbrush and gathered her to his breast,\r\ncradling her, cherishing her to him as though to bring back life and\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nTo her heart he laid his ear. It beat! She breathed!\r\n\r\n\"The light, here! Quick!\"\r\n\r\nBy its clear ray he saw her hair disheveled; her coarse mantle of\r\nbrown stuff ripped and torn, and on her throat long scratches.\r\n\r\nBruises showed on her hands and arms, as from a terrible fight she had\r\nput up against the monster. And his heart bled; and to his lips rose\r\nexecrations, mingled with the tenderest words of pity and love.\r\n\r\n\"We must get her back to the cave at once!\" he exclaimed. \"Quick!\r\nBreak branches. Make a litter--a bed--to carry her on! Everything\r\ndepends on getting her to shelter now!\"\r\n\r\nBut the two Merucaans did not understand. All this was beyond their\r\nknowledge. Ignoring his hurts, Allan laid the girl down very gently,\r\nand with them set to work, directing the making of the litter.\r\n\r\nThey obeyed eagerly. In a few minutes the litter was ready-made of\r\nfern-tree branches thickly covered with leaves and odorous grasses.\r\n\r\nOn this he placed the girl.\r\n\r\n\"You, Zangamon, take these boughs here. Bremilu, those others. Now I\r\nwill hold the light. Back to the cave, now--quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"We need not the light, master. We see better without it. It dazzles\r\nour eyes. Use it for yourself. We need it not!\" exclaimed Bremilu,\r\nstooping above the body of the dead monster to recover his ax.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily Allan turned the beam upon the horrible creature. There\r\nstood Bremilu, his foot upon the hairy shoulder, tugging hard at the\r\nax-handle. Thrice he had to pull with all his might to loosen the\r\nblade which had buried itself deep in the shattered skull.\r\n\r\n\"A giant gorilla, so help me!\" he cried, shuddering. \"My God,\r\nBeatrice--what a ghastly terror you've been through!\"\r\n\r\nStill grinning ferociously, in death, with blood-smeared face and\r\nglazed, staring eyes, the creature shocked and horrified even Allan's\r\nsteady nerves. He gazed upon it only a moment, then turned away.\r\n\r\n\"Enough!\" said he. \"To the cave!\"\r\n\r\nA quarter-hour had passed before they reached shelter again. Allan\r\nbade the Merucaans heap dry wood on the embers in the cavern, while he\r\nhimself laid Beatrice upon the bed.\r\n\r\nWith a piece of their brown cloth dipped in one of the water-jars he\r\nbathed her face and bruised throat.\r\n\r\n\"Fresh water! Fetch a jar of fresh water from the river below!\" he\r\ncommanded Zangamon.\r\n\r\nBut even as the white barbarian started to obey, the girl stirred,\r\nraised a hand, and feebly spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Allan--oh--are you here again? Allan--my love!\"\r\n\r\nHe strained her to his breast and kissed her; and his eyes grew hot\r\nwith tears.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice!\"\r\n\r\nHer arms were round his neck, and their lips clung.\r\n\r\n\"Hurt? Are you hurt?\" he cried. \"Tell me--how--\"\r\n\r\n\"Allen! The monster--is he dead?\" she shivered, sitting up and staring\r\nwildly round at the cave walls on which the fresh-built fire was\r\nbeginning to throw dancing lights.\r\n\r\n\"Dead, yes. But hush, Beta! Don't think of that now. Everything's all\r\nright--you're safe! I'm here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Those men--\"\r\n\r\n\"Two of our own Folk. I brought them back with me--just in time,\r\ndarling. Without them--\"\r\n\r\nHe broke short off. Not for worlds would he have told her how near the\r\nborderland she had been.\r\n\r\n\"You heard my shouts? You heard our signal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--I don't know Allan. I can't think, yet--it's all so terrible--so\r\nconfused--\"\r\n\r\n\"There, there, sweetheart; don't think about it any more. Just lie\r\ndown and rest. Go to sleep. I'll watch here beside you. You're safe.\r\nNothing can hurt you now!\"\r\n\r\nShe lay back with a sigh, and for a while kept silence while he sat\r\nbeside her, his uninjured arm beneath her head.\r\n\r\nHis one ambition, now that he found she was not seriously hurt in\r\nbody, was to keep her from talking of the horrible affair--from\r\nexciting herself and rehearsing her terrors. Above all, she must be\r\nquieted and kept calm.\r\n\r\nAt last, in her own natural voice, she spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"Allan?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, sweetheart?\"\r\n\r\n\"I owe you my life once more! If I was yours before, I'm ten times\r\nmore yours now!\"\r\n\r\nHe bent and kissed her, and presently her deepened breathing told him\r\nshe had drifted over the borderline into the sleep of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nHe blessed her strength and courage.\r\n\r\n\"No futility here,\" thought he. \"No useless questions or hysterics; no\r\nscene. Strong! Gad, but she's strong! She realized she was safe and I\r\nwas with her again; that sufficed. Was there ever another woman like\r\nher since the world began?\"\r\n\r\nOnly now that the girl slept did he pay attention to the two Merucaans\r\nwho, sitting by the cave door, were regarding him with troubled looks.\r\n\r\n\"Master!\" said Zangamon, arising and coming toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it now?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are wounded, O Kromno! Your arm still bleeds. Let us bind it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing--only a scratch!\"\r\n\r\nBut Zangamon insisted.\r\n\r\n\"Master,\" said he, \"in this we cannot obey you. See? While you and the\r\nwoman talked I fetched water, as you commanded. Now I must wash your\r\nhurts and bind them.\"\r\n\r\nAllan had to accede. Together the two Merucaans examined the injuries\r\nwith words of commiseration. The \"scratch\" turned out to be three\r\nsevere lacerations of the forearm. The gorilla's teeth had missed the\r\nradial artery only by a fluke of fortune.\r\n\r\nThey bathed away the clotted blood and bandaged the arm not\r\nunskilfully. Allan pressed the hand of Zangamon, then that of his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"No thanks of mine can tell you what I feel!\" he exclaimed straight\r\nfrom the heart. \"Only for you to guide me, to drive the man-brute, to\r\nstrike it down when it was just about to throttle me--only for you,\r\nboth _she_ and _I_--\"\r\n\r\nHe could not finish. The words choked him. He felt, as never before, a\r\nsudden, warm, human touch of kinship with the Merucaans--a strong,\r\nnascent affection. Till now they had been savages to him--inferiors.\r\n\r\nNow he perceived their inner worth--the strong and manly stamina of\r\nsoul and body; and through him thrilled a love for these strange men,\r\nhis saviors and the girl's.\r\n\r\nOnce more he seemed to see a vision of the future--a world peopled by\r\nthe descendants of this hardy and resourceful folk, \"without disease\r\nof flesh or brain, shapely and fair, the married harmony of form and\r\nfunction\"--and, as with a gesture, he dismissed them wondering, not\r\nunderstanding in the least why he should thank them, he knew the world\r\nalready had begun once more to come back under the hand, under the\r\nstrong control of man.\r\n\r\n\"Sleep now, master,\" Bremilu entreated. \"We who are new to this\r\nstrange world will sit outside the door upon the rock and watch those\r\nfires so far above that you call stars. And the big sun-fire that is\r\ncoming, too--we would see that!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not yet!\" Stern commanded. \"You cannot bear it for a while. Stay\r\nwithin and roll the rock against the door and sleep. The great fire\r\nmight injure you or even kill you, as it did the--\"\r\n\r\nHe checked himself just in time, for \"the patriarch\" had all but\r\nescaped him. Zangamon, with sudden understanding, once more advanced\r\ntoward him as he sat there by the girl.\r\n\r\n\"O master! You mean the ancient man? He is dead?\"\r\n\r\nStern nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"He was so old and weak, the touch of the fire in\r\nthe sky--he could not bear it. But his death was happy, for at least\r\nhe felt its warmth upon his brow!\"\r\n\r\nThe Merucaans kept silence for a moment, then Stern heard them\r\nmurmuring together, and a vague uneasiness crept over him.\r\n\r\nHe strove, however, to put it away; though in his heart the shame of\r\nthe lie he had been forced to tell would not be quieted.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, however, made no further speech, but presently rolled\r\nthe rock in front of the cave entrance, then wrapped themselves in\r\ntheir long cloaks and lay down by the fire.\r\n\r\nSoon, like the healthy savages they were, they were fast asleep, with\r\nvigorous snorings.\r\n\r\nThus the night passed, while Stern kept watch over the girl; and\r\nanother day crept slowly up the sky, and in the cave now rested four\r\nhuman beings--the vanguard of the coming nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE DISTANT MENACE\r\n\r\n\r\nStern never knew when he, too, drifted off to sleep; but he\r\nawoke to find Zangamon sitting beside him, with his cloak drawn over\r\nhis head, while Beatrice and Bremilu still slept.\r\n\r\n\"The light, master--it is like knives to me! Like spears to my eyes,\r\nmaster! I cannot bear it!\" whispered the Merucaan, pointing to where,\r\naround the interstices of the doorway, bright white gleams were\r\nstreaming in.\r\n\r\nAllan considered with perplexity.\r\n\r\n\"It hurts, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Kromno! Once or twice I have tried to watch that strange fire,\r\nbut I cannot. The pain is very great!\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" thought Allan. \"This may be a more serious factor than I've\r\nreckoned on. These people are albinos. White hair and pink eyes--not a\r\nparticle of protecting pigmentation. For thirty or so generations\r\nthey've been subjected to nothing but torchlight. The actinic rays of\r\nthe sun are infinitely more penetrating than anything they've ever\r\nknown. It may take months, years even, to accustom them to sunlight!\"\r\n\r\nAnd disquieting situations presented themselves to his mind. True, if\r\nit were necessary, the Folk could work and take the air only at night.\r\n\r\nThey could fish, hunt and till the soil by star and moonlight, and\r\nsleep by day; but this was by no means the veritable reestablishment\r\nof a real, human civilization.\r\n\r\nThen an idea struck him.\r\n\r\n\"The very thing!\" cried he. \"Once I can put it into effect, it will\r\nsolve the question. And the second generation, at the outside, will be\r\nnormal. They'll 'throw back' to remote ancestry under changed\r\nconditions. In time, even if only a long time, all will yet be well!\"\r\n\r\nBut now immediate labors and difficult problems were pressing. The\r\nfuture would have to look out for itself.\r\n\r\nStern felt positive that to let the Merucaans out of the cave would\r\nnot only blind them, but might also kill them outright as well.\r\n\r\nTheir unprotected skins would inevitably burn to a blister under the\r\nrays of the sun, and they would in all probability die. So said he:\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Zangamon! You must stay here till the dark comes again, which\r\nwill not be very long. The woman and I will prepare another cave for\r\nyour dwelling. When it is dark you can fish in the flowing water\r\nbeneath. In the mean time we will bring you your accustomed food and\r\nyour nets from the flying boat.\r\n\r\n\"You must be patient. In a short time all things shall be as you wish,\r\nand you shall see the wonderful and beautiful world up into which I\r\nhave brought you!\"\r\n\r\nThe man nodded, yet Stern clearly saw his face betrayed uneasiness,\r\ndistrust and pain. In all fairness, the Merucaans' first experience of\r\nthe upper world had been enough to shake the faith even of a\r\nphilosopher--how much more so that of simple and untaught barbarians!\r\n\r\nTerror, violence, slaughter and insecurity--these all had greeted the\r\ncolonists; and now, in addition, they found the patriarch was dead.\r\nAbove all, they were virtually prisoners in this gloomy cavern of the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nBut Stern was very wise. He by no means thought of commiserating or\r\nexcusing. His only course was to make light of trials and hardships,\r\nand, if need were, to command.\r\n\r\nHe arose, carefully stopped up the chinks around the rock at the\r\ndoorway, and bade Zangamon replenish the fire with dry sticks. Then,\r\nBremilu awakening, they prepared food.\r\n\r\nNow Beatrice, too, awoke. Allan took her in his arms, unmindful of the\r\nnewcomers, and there were words of love and joy, and self-reproaches,\r\nand a new faith plighted between them once again.\r\n\r\nShe was unharmed, except for a few bruises and scratches. Her nerves\r\nhad already recovered something of their usual strength. But at sight\r\nof Allan's bandaged arni she turned pale, and not even his assurances\r\ncould comfort her.\r\n\r\nThey talked of the terrible adventure.\r\n\r\n\"It was all my fault, Allan--every bit my fault!\" she exclaimed\r\nremorsefully. \"It all came from my not obeying orders. You see, I was\r\nexpecting you last night. Instead of staying in the cave, with the\r\ndoor barricaded, I lingered on the terrace, after having piled the\r\nsignal-fire high with wood.\r\n\r\n\"I sat down and watched the sky, and listened to the river down below,\r\nand thought of you. I must have dozed a little, for all of a sudden I\r\ncame wide-awake, shuddering with a terror I couldn't understand. Then\r\nI heard something moving down the path--something that grunted and\r\nsnuffled savagely.\r\n\r\n\"I started up, ran for the cave, and just got inside when the brute\r\nreached it. I rolled the stone in place, Allan, but before I could\r\nbrace it with the pole it was hurled back, and in crawled the gorilla,\r\nroaring and snapping like a demon!\"\r\n\r\nShe hid her face in both hands, shuddering at the terrible memory.\r\nBut, forcing herself to be calm, she went on again:\r\n\r\n\"I snatched up the pistol and fired. Then--\"\r\n\r\n\"You hit him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must have, for he screeched most horribly and pawed at his\r\nbreast--\"\r\n\r\n\"So, then, that explains the blood-marks on the floor and the great\r\nhand-print on the wall?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hand-print? Was there one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but no matter now. Go on!\"\r\n\r\n\"After that--oh, it was too ghastly! He seized me and I fought--I\r\nstruggled against that huge, hairy chest; he gripped me like iron. My\r\nblows were no more than so many pats to him.\r\n\r\n\"I tried to fire again, but he wrenched the pistol away, and bent it\r\nin his huge teeth and flung it down. But, though he was raging, he\r\ndidn't wound me--didn't try to kill me, or anything. He seemed to want\r\nto capture me alive--\"\r\n\r\nAllan shuddered. Only too well he understood. Gorilla nature had not\r\nchanged in fifteen hundred years.\r\n\r\n\"After that?\" he questioned eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, after that I don't remember much. I must have fainted. Next thing\r\nI knew, everything was dark and the forest was all about. I screamed\r\nand then again I knew nothing. Once more I seemed to sense things, and\r\nonce more all grew black. And after that--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--I was here on the bed, and you were beside me, Allan--and these\r\nmen of our Folk were here! But how it all happened, God knows!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you some time. You shall have the story from our side some\r\nday, but not now. Only one thing--if it hadn't been for Zangamon here\r\nand Bremilu--well--\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean they helped rescue me?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Without them I'd have been helpless as a child. They traced you in\r\nthe dark, for they could see as plainly as we see by day. It was a\r\nblow from Bremilu's stone ax that killed the brute. _They_ saved you,\r\nBeatrice! Not I!\"\r\n\r\nShe kept a little silence, then said thoughtfully:\r\n\r\n\"How can I ever thank them, Allan? How can I thank them best?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't thank them. There's no way. I tried it, but they didn't\r\nunderstand. They only did what seemed natural to them. They're\r\nsavages, remember; not civilized men. It's impossible to thank them!\r\nThe only thing you can do, or I can do, is work for them now. The\r\ngreatest efforts and sacrifices for these men will be small payment\r\nfor their deed. And if--as I believe--the whole race is dowered with\r\nthe same spirit and indomitable courage--the courage we certainly did\r\nsee in the Battle of the Wall--then we need have no fear of our\r\ntransplanted nation dying out!\"\r\n\r\nMuch more there might have been to say, but now the meal was ready,\r\nand hunger spoke in no uncertain tones. All four of the adventurers\r\nate in silence, thoughtful and grave, cross-legged, about the meat and\r\ndrink, which lay on palm-leaves or in clay bowls hard-burned and red.\r\n\r\nA kind of embarrassment seemed to rest on all, for this was the first\r\ntime they had eaten together--these barbarians with the two folk of\r\nthe upper world.\r\n\r\nBut the meal was soon at an end, and the prospect of labors to be\r\nundertaken cheered Allan's spirit. Despite his stiff and painful arm,\r\nhe felt courage and energy throbbing in his veins, and longed to be at\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\"The very first thing we must do,\" said he, \"is fix up a place for our\r\nguests. They've got to stay here, out of the light, till nightfall.\r\nThat will give us plenty of time. I want to get them settled in their\r\nown quarters, and bring them into some regular routine of life and\r\nlabor, before they have a chance to get homesick and dejected.\"\r\n\r\nHe warned the Merucaans to cover their heads with their cloaks while\r\nBeatrice and he opened the doorway.\r\n\r\nHe closed it then, with other rocks outside, and covered it with his\r\nown outer cloak; then, wearing only his belted tunic, he rejoined\r\nBeatrice half-way up the path to the cliff-top. Both were armed; he\r\nwith his own automatic, she with the one they had found in the crypt.\r\n\r\n\"Our first move,\" said he, \"will be to transport the various things\r\nfrom the aeroplane. It will be something of a task, but I don't dare\r\nleave them out there on the barrens till night, when the men\r\nthemselves could bring them in. The sooner we get things to rights the\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\nShe agreed, and together they took the path toward the landing-place,\r\nwhich they had christened Newport Heights. Stern felt grateful that\r\nhis right arm, his gun arm, was uninjured. The other mattered little\r\nfor the present.\r\n\r\nAn idea crossed his mind to seek out the dead gorilla and make a\r\ntrophy of the pelt; but he dismissed it at once. The beast was so\r\nrepellent that the very thought of it fair sickened him.\r\n\r\nThey reached the plane in some few minutes, found everything\r\nuninjured, and loaded themselves with the Merucaans' goods and\r\nchattels. Stern took the bags of edible seaweed and the metal crate of\r\nfowl; she draped the big net over her shoulders, and together, not\r\nwithout difficulty, they returned to Settlement Cliffs.\r\n\r\nPass, now, all the minute details of the installation. By noon they\r\nhad prepared a habitation for the newcomers, deep in a far recess of a\r\nwinding gallery which thoroughly excluded all direct sunlight.\r\n\r\nOnly the dimmest glow penetrated even at high noon. Here they stowed\r\nthe freight, built a rock fireplace, and threw down quantities of the\r\nlong, fragrant grass for bedding.\r\n\r\nThey returned to their own cave, bade the colonists once more cover\r\ntheir heads, and entered, carefully closing the doorway after them.\r\nAll four dined together, in true Merucaan style, on the familiar food\r\nof the Abyss. The colonists seemed a little more reassured, but talk\r\nlanguished none the less.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was spent in preparing a second cave; for, in spite of\r\nall the girl's entreaties, Allan was determined to make another visit\r\nto the village of the Lost Folk as soon as his arm should permit.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing can happen this time, dear girl,\" he assured her as they sat\r\nresting by the mouth of the newly prepared dwelling. \"You'll have two\r\nabsolutely faithful and efficient guards always within call by night.\r\nBy day you can barricade yourself with them, if there's any sign of\r\ndanger.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, Allan, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no other way! Our work is just begun!\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded silently, then said in a low tone:\r\n\r\n\"Yours the labor; mine the waiting, the watching, and the fear!\"\r\n\r\n\"The fear? Since when have you grown timid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only for you, Allan! Only for you! Suppose, some time, you should not\r\ncome back!\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed.\r\n\r\n\"We thrashed that all out the first time. It's old straw, Beta. My end\r\nof the task is getting these people here. Yours is waiting,\r\nwatching--and being strong!\"\r\n\r\nHer hand tightened on his, and for a little while they sat quite still\r\nand without speech, watching the day draw to its close.\r\n\r\nFar below, New Hope River chattered its incessant gossip to the vexing\r\nboulders. Above, in the sky, lazy June clouds, wool-white, drifted to\r\nwestward, as though seeking the glory that there promised to transmute\r\nthem into gold and crimson.\r\n\r\nA pleasant wind swayed the forest, wherein the scarlet birds flitted\r\nlike flashes of flame. The beauty of the outlook thrilled their\r\nhearts, leaving no room for words.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly Allan's eyes narrowed, and with a singular hardening of\r\nexpression, a tightening of the jaw, he peered away at the dim,\r\nhaze-shrouded line of far horizon to northeastward.\r\n\r\nHe cast a sidelong glance at Beatrice. She had noticed nothing.\r\n\r\nOne moment he made as though to speak, then repressed the words, and\r\nonce more gazed at the horizon.\r\n\r\nThere, so vague as almost to leave a doubt in mind, yet, after all,\r\nonly too terribly real, his keen sight had detected something which\r\ncaused his heart to throb the quicker and his eye to gleam with hate.\r\n\r\nFor, at the very rim of the world, dim, pale, ominous, three tiny\r\nthreads of smoke were hanging in the evening air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE ANNUNCIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nA week later all was ready for Allan's second trip into the\r\nAbyss.\r\n\r\nHis arm had recovered its usual strength and suppleness, for his\r\nflesh, healthy as any savage's, now had the power of healing with a\r\nrapidity unknown to civilized men in the old days.\r\n\r\nAnd his abounding vigor dictated action--always action, progress, and\r\naccomplishment. Only one thing depressed him--idleness.\r\n\r\nIt was on the second day of July, according to the rude calendar they\r\nwere keeping, that he once more bade farewell to Beatrice and, borne\r\nby the Pauillac, headed for the village of the Lost Folk.\r\n\r\nHe left behind him all matters in a state of much improvement.\r\nZangamon and Bremilu were now well installed in the new environment\r\nand seemingly content. By night they fished in New Hope Pool, making\r\nhauls such as their steaming sea had never yielded.\r\n\r\nThey wandered--not too far, however--in the forest, gradually making\r\nthe acquaintance of the wondrous upper world, and with their strangely\r\nacute instincts finding fruits, bulbs and plants that well agreed with\r\nthem for food.\r\n\r\nAllan had carefully instructed them in the use of the wonderful\r\n\"fire-bow\"--the revolver--warning them, however, not to waste\r\nammunition. They learned quickly, and now Beatrice found her larder\r\nsupplied each night with game, which they dressed and brought her in\r\nthe evening gloom, eager to serve their mistress in all possible ways.\r\n\r\nThey fished for her as well, and all the choicest fruits were her\r\nportion. She, in turn, cooked for them in their own cave. And for an\r\nhour or two each night she instructed them in English.\r\n\r\nShort are the annals of peace--and peace reigned at Settlement Cliffs\r\nthose few days at least. Progress!\r\n\r\nShe could feel it, see it, every hour. And her thoughts of Allan, now\r\nabandoning their melancholy hue, began to thrill with a new and even\r\ngreater pride.\r\n\r\n\"Only he, only he could have brought these things to pass!\" she\r\nmurmured sometimes. \"Only he could have planned all this, dreamed this\r\ndream, and brought it to reality; only he could labor for the future\r\nso strongly and so well!\"\r\n\r\nAnd in her heart the love that had been that of a girl became that of\r\na woman. It broadened, deepened and grew calmer.\r\n\r\nIts fever cooled into a finer, purer glow. It strengthened day by day,\r\ntransmuting to a perfect trust and confidence and peace.\r\n\r\nAllan returned safely inside the week with two more of the\r\nFolk--warriors and fishers both. Beatrice would have welcomed the\r\narrival of even one woman to bear her some kind of company, but she\r\nrealized the wisdom of his plan.\r\n\r\n\"The main thing at first,\" he explained, as they sat again on the\r\nterrace the evening of his return, \"the very most essential thing is\r\nto build up even a small force of fighting men to hold the colony and\r\nprotect it--a stalwart advance-guard, as if this were a military\r\nexpedition. After that the women and children can come. But for the\r\npresent there's no place for them.\"\r\n\r\nNow that there were four Merucaans, all seemed more contented. The\r\nlittle group settled down into some real semblance of a community.\r\n\r\nWork became systematized. Life was beginning to take firm root in the\r\nworld again, and already the outlines of the future colony were\r\ncommencing to be sketched in.\r\n\r\nSo far as Stern could discover, no disaffection as yet existed. The\r\nFolk, in any event, were singularly stolid, here as in their own home.\r\nIf the colonists sometimes muttered together against conditions or\r\nconcerning the lie Allan had told about the patriarch, he could never\r\ndiscover the fact.\r\n\r\nHe derived a singular sense of power and exaltation from watching his\r\nsettlers at their work.\r\n\r\nStrange figures they made in the upper world, descending the cliff at\r\nnight, their torches flaring on their pure-white hair bound with gold\r\nornaments, their nets slung over their brown-clad shoulders.\r\n\r\nStrange, too, were the sensations of Beta and Allan as they beheld the\r\nflambeaux gleaming silently along the pool or over the surface when\r\nthe Folk put forth on the rude rafts Allan had helped them build.\r\n\r\nAnd as, with the same weird song they had used in the under world, the\r\nheavy-laden Merucaans clambered again up the terraces to their\r\ndwelling in the rock, something drew very powerfully at Allan's heart.\r\n\r\nHe analyzed it not, being a man of deeds rather than of introspection;\r\nyet it was \"the strong man yearning toward his kind,\" the very love of\r\nhis own race within him--the thrill, the inspiration of the master\r\nbuilder laying the foundations for better things to be.\r\n\r\nAllan and the girl had long talks about the character of the future\r\ncivilization they meant to raise.\r\n\r\n\"We must begin right this time at all hazards,\" he told her. \"The\r\nworld we used to know just happened; it just grew up, hit-or-miss,\r\nwithout scientific planning or thought or care. It was partly the\r\nresult of chance, partly of ignorance and greed. The kind of human\r\nnature it developed was in essence a beast nature, with 'Grab!' for\r\nits creed.\r\n\r\n\"We must do better than that! From the very start, now, we must nip\r\noff the evil bud that might later blossom into private property and\r\nwealth, exploitation and misery. There shall be no rich men in our\r\nworld now and no slaves. No idlers and no oppressed. 'Service' must be\r\nour watchword, and our motto 'Each for all and all for each!'\r\n\r\n\"While there are fish within the river and fruit upon the palm, none\r\nshall starve and none shall hoard. Superstition and dogma, fear and\r\ncruelty, shall have no place with us. We understand--you and I; and\r\nwhat we know we shall teach. And nothing shall survive of the world\r\nthat was, save such things as were good. For the old order has passed\r\naway--and the new day shall be a better one.\"\r\n\r\nThus for hours at a time, by starlight and moonlight on the\r\nrock-terrace or by fire-glow in their cave--now homelike with\r\nrough-hewn furniture and mats of plaited grass--they talked and\r\ndreamed and planned.\r\n\r\nAnd executed, too; for they drew up a few basic, simple laws, and\r\nthese they taught their little colony even now, for from the very\r\nbeginning they meant the germs of the new society should root in the\r\nhearts of the rescued race.\r\n\r\nThe third trip was delayed by a tremendous rain that poured with\r\ntropic suddenness and fury over the face of the world, driven on the\r\nbreath of a wild-shouting tempest.\r\n\r\nFor the space of two days heaven and earth were blotted out by the\r\ngray, hurling sheets of wind-driven water, while down the canyon New\r\nHope River roared and foamed in thunder cadences.\r\n\r\nBeta and Allan, warmly and snugly sheltered in their cave, cared\r\nnothing for the storm. It only served to remind them of that other\r\ntorrential downpour, soon after they had reached the village of the\r\nFolk; but now how altered the situation! Captives then, they were\r\nmasters now; and the dread chasms of the Abyss were now exchanged for\r\nthe beauties and the freedom of the upper world.\r\n\r\nNo wind could shake, no deluge invade, their house among the\r\neverlasting rock-ribs. Bright crackled their fire, and on the broad\r\ndivan of cedar he had hewn and covered thick with furs, they two could\r\nlie and talk and dream, and let the storm rage, careless of its\r\nimpotent fury.\r\n\r\n\"There's only one sorrow in my heart,\" whispered Beta, drawing his\r\nhead down on her breast and smoothing his hair with that familiar,\r\nwell-loved caress. \"Just one, dear--can you guess it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No millinery shops to visit, you mean?\" he rallied her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Allan, when I'm so much in earnest, how can you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's the trouble, sweetheart?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the storm ends you're going to leave me again! I wish--I almost\r\nwish it would rain forever!\"\r\n\r\nHe made no answer, and she, as one who sees strange and sad visions,\r\ngazed into the leaping flames, and in her deep gray eyes lay tears\r\nunshed.\r\n\r\n\"Sing to me!\" he murmured presently.\r\n\r\nStroking his head and brow, she sang as aforetime at the bungalow upon\r\nthe Hudson:\r\n\r\n  Stark wie der Fels,\r\n  Tief wie das Meer,\r\n  Muss deine Liebe,\r\n  Muss deine Liebe sein! ...\r\n\r\nThe third trip was made in safety, and others after it, and steadily\r\nthe colony took shape and growth.\r\n\r\nMore and more the caves came to be occupied. Stern set the Merucaans\r\nto work excavating the limestone, piercing tunnels and chimneys,\r\nmaking passageways and preparing for the ever-increasing number of\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\nTheir native arts and crafts began to flourish. In the gloomy recesses\r\nfires glowed hot. Ores began to be smelted, with primitive bellows and\r\ntechnique as in the Under-world, and through the night--stillness\r\nsounded the ring and clangor of anvils mightily smitten.\r\n\r\nPalm-fibers yielded cordage for more nets or finer thread for the\r\nlooms that now began to clack--for at last some few women had arrived,\r\nand even a couple of the strong, pale children, who had traveled\r\nstowed in crates like the water-fowl.\r\n\r\nBy night the pool and river gleamed more and more brightly. Boats\r\nnavigated even the rapids, for these were hardy water-people, whose\r\nwhole life had been semi-aquatic.\r\n\r\nThe strange fowl nested in the cliff below the settlement, hiding by\r\nday, flying abroad by night, swimming and diving in the river, even\r\nrearing their broods of squawking, naked little monsters in rough\r\nnests of twigs and mud.\r\n\r\nSome of the hardier of the first-arrived colonists had already--far\r\nsooner than Allan had hoped--begun to tolerate a little daylight.\r\n\r\nFollowing his original idea, he prepared some sets of brown mica\r\neye-shields, and by the aid of these a number of the Merucaans were\r\nable to endure an hour or two of early dawn and late evening in the\r\nopen air.\r\n\r\nThe children, he found, were far less sensitive to light than the\r\nadults--a natural sequence of the atavistic principle well known to\r\nall biologists.\r\n\r\nHe hoped that in a year or so many of the Folk might even bear the\r\nnoon-day sun. Once he could get them to working with him by daylight\r\nhis progress would leap forward mightily in many lines of activity\r\nthat he had planned.\r\n\r\nAn occasional short raid with the Pauillac had stocked the colony with\r\nfirearms, chemicals and necessary drugs, cutlery, ammunition and some\r\nglassware, from the dismantled cities of Nashville, Cincinnati,\r\nIndianapolis and other places unidentified.\r\n\r\nAllan foresaw almost infinite possibilities in these raids.\r\nCivilization he felt, would surge onward with amazing rapidity\r\nfostered by this detritus of the distant past.\r\n\r\nHe also unearthed and brought back to Settlement Cliffs the\r\nphonographs and records, sealed in their oiled canvas and hidden in\r\nthe rock-cleft near the patriarch's grave.\r\n\r\nThereafter of an evening the voices of other days sang in the cave.\r\nAround the entrance, now protected by stout and ample timber doors,\r\ngathered an eager, wondering, fascinated group, understanding the\r\nuniversal appeal of harmony, softened and humanized by the music of\r\nthe world that was. And thus, too, was the education of the Folk\r\nmaking giant strides.\r\n\r\nProgress, tremendous progress, toward the goal!\r\n\r\n\r\nAutumn came down the world, and the sun paled a\r\nlittle as it sank to southward in the heavens. Warmth and luxuriant\r\nfertility, fecundity without parallel, still pervaded the earth, but a\r\ncertain change had even so become well marked. Slowly the year was\r\ndying, that another might be born.\r\n\r\nIt was of a glorious purple evening late in October that Allan made\r\nthe great discovery.\r\n\r\nHe had come in from working with two or three of the hardier Folk on\r\nthe temporary hangar he was building for the Pauillac on Newport\r\nHeights, to which a broad and well-graded roadway now extended through\r\nthe jungle.\r\n\r\nEntering the home-cave suddenly--and it was home now indeed, with its\r\nbroad stone fireplace, its comfortable furnishings, its furs, its mats\r\nof clean, sweet-smelling rushes--he stopped, toil-worn and weary, to\r\nview the well-loved place.\r\n\r\n\"Well, little wife! Busy, as usual? Always busy, sweetheart?\"\r\n\r\nAt his greeting Beatrice looked up as though startled. She was sitting\r\nin a low easy-chair he had made for her of split bamboos cleverly\r\nlashed and softly cushioned.\r\n\r\nAt her left hand, on the palm-wood table, stood a heavy bronze lamp\r\nfrom some forgotten millionaire's palace in Atlanta. Its soft radiance\r\nillumined her face in profile, making a wondrous aureole of her\r\nclustered hair, as in old paintings of the Madonna at the\r\nAnnunciation.\r\n\r\nA presage gripped the man's heart, drawing powerfully at its strings\r\nwith pain, yet with delicious hope and joy as she turned toward him.\r\n\r\nFor something in her face, some new, beatified, maternal loveliness,\r\nnot to be analyzed or understood, betrayed her wondrous secret.\r\n\r\nWith a little gasp, she dropped into her lap the bit of needlework and\r\nsought to hide it with her hands--a gesture wholly girlish yet--to\r\nhide and guard it with those hands, so useful and beautiful, so\r\nprecious and so dearly loved.\r\n\r\nBut Allan, breathing hard and deep, strode to her, his face aflame\r\nwith hope and adoration. He caught them up together in the gentle\r\nstrength of his rough hands and pressed them to his heart.\r\n\r\nBeside her he knelt silently; he encircled her with his right arm.\r\nThen he took up the tiny garment, smiling.\r\n\r\nFor a long minute their eyes met.\r\n\r\nHis brimmed with sudden tears. Hers fell, and her head drooped down\r\nupon his breast, and--as once before, at the cathedral--an eloquent\r\ntide of crimson mounted from breast to throat, from cheek to\r\ntendrilled hair.\r\n\r\nAbout his neck her arms slid, trembled, tightened.\r\n\r\nNo word was uttered there under the golden lamp-glow; but the strong\r\nkiss he pressed, reverently, proudly, upon her brow, renewed with\r\nten-time depth their eternal sacrament of love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE MASTER OF HIS RACE\r\n\r\n\r\nDays, busy days, lengthened into weeks, and these to months\r\nhappy and full of labor; and in the ever-growing colony progress and\r\nchange came steadily forward.\r\n\r\nAll along the cliff-face and the terraces the cave-dwellings now\r\nextended, and the smoke from a score of chimneys fashioned among the\r\nclefts rose on the temperate air of that sub-tropic winter.\r\n\r\nAt the doors, nets hung drying. On the pool, boats were anchored at\r\nseveral well-built stone wharfs. The terraces had been walled with\r\npalisades on their outer edge and smooth roadways fashioned, leading\r\nto all the dwellings as well as to the river below.\r\n\r\nOn top of the cliff and about three hundred yards back from the edge\r\nanother palisade had been built of stout timbers set firmly in the\r\nearth, interlaced with cordage and propped with strong braces.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed space, bounded to east and west by the barrier which\r\nswung toward and touched the canyon, had all been cleared, save for a\r\nfew palms and fern-trees left for shade.\r\n\r\nBeside drying-frames for fish and game and a well-smoothed plaza for\r\npublic assemblies and the giving of the Law, it now contained Stern's\r\npermanent hangar. The Pauillac had been brought along the road from\r\nNewport Heights and housed there.\r\n\r\nThis road passed through strong gates of hewn planks hinged with\r\nwell-wrought ironwork forged by some of the Folk under the direction\r\nof H'yemba, the smith. For H'yemba, be it known, had been brought up\r\nby Stern early in December.\r\n\r\nThe man was essential to progress, for none knew so well as he the\r\narts of smelting and of metal-work. Stern still felt suspicious of\r\nhim, but by no word or act did the smith now betray any rebellious\r\nspirit, any animosity, or aught but faithful service.\r\n\r\nAllan, however, could not trust him yet. No telling what fires might\r\nstill be smoldering under the peaceful and industrious exterior. And\r\nthe master's eye often rested keenly on the powerful figure of the\r\nblacksmith.\r\n\r\nAcross the canyon, from a point about fifty yards to eastward of Cliff\r\nVilla--as Beta and Allan had christened their home--a light bridge had\r\nbeen flung, connecting the northern with the southern bank and saving\r\nlaborious toil in crossing via the river-bed.\r\n\r\nThis bridge, of simple construction, was merely temporary. Allan\r\ncounted on eventually putting up a first-class cantilever; but for now\r\nhe was content with two stout fiber cables anchored to palm-trunks,\r\nfloored with rough boards lashed in place with cordage, and railed\r\nwith strong rope.\r\n\r\nThis bridge opened up a whole new tract of country to northward and\r\nvastly widened the fruit and game supply. Plenty reigned at Settlement\r\nCliffs; and a prosperity such as the Folk had never known in the\r\nAbyss, a well-being, a luxurious variety of foodstuffs--fruits, meats,\r\nwild vegetables--as well as a profusion of furs for clothing, banished\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\nBarring a little temporary depression and lassitude due to the great\r\nalteration of environment, the Folk experienced but slight ill effects\r\nfrom the change.\r\n\r\nAnd, once they grew acclimated, their health and vigor rapidly\r\nimproved. Strangest of all, a phenomenon most marked in the children,\r\nAllan noticed that after a few weeks under the altered conditions of\r\nfood and exposure to the actinic rays of the sun as reflected by the\r\nmoonlight, pigmentation began to develop. A certain clouding of the\r\niris began to show, premonitory of color-deposit. The skin lost\r\nsomething of its chalky hue, while at the roots of the hair, as it\r\ngrew, a distinct infiltration of pigment-cells was visible. And at\r\nthis sight Allan rejoiced exceedingly.\r\n\r\nBeatrice did not now go much abroad with him, on account of her\r\ncondition. She hardly ventured farther than the top of the cliff, and\r\nmany days she sat in her low chair on the terrace, resting, watching\r\nthe river and the forest, thinking, dreaming, sewing for the little\r\nnew colonist soon to arrive. Some of their most happy hours were spent\r\nthus, as Allan sat beside her in the sun, talking of their future. The\r\nbond between them had grown closer and more intimate. They two, linked\r\nby another still unseen, were one.\r\n\r\n\"Will you be very angry with me, dear, if it's a girl?\" she asked one\r\nday, smiling a little wistfully.\r\n\r\n\"Angry? Have I ever been angry with you, darling? Could I ever be?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"No; but you might if I disappointed you now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! Of course, the world's work demands a chief, a head, a\r\nleader, to come after me and take up the reins when they fall from my\r\nhands, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if it's a girl--only a girl--you'll love me just the same?\"\r\n\r\nHis answer was a pressure of her hand, which he brought to his lips\r\nand held there a long minute. She smiled again and in the following\r\nsilence their souls spoke together though their lips were mute.\r\n\r\nBut Beta had her work to do those days as well as Allan.\r\n\r\nWhile he planned the public works of the colony and directed their\r\nconstruction at night, or made his routine weekly trip into the Abyss\r\nfor more and ever more of the Folk--a greatly shortened trip, now that\r\nhe knew the way so well and needed stop below ground only long enough\r\nto rest a bit and take on oil and fuel--she was busy with her teaching\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nThey had carefully discussed this matter, and had decided to impose\r\nEnglish bodily and arbitrarily upon the colonists. Every evening\r\nBeatrice gathered a class of the younger men and women, always\r\nincluding the children, and for an hour or two drilled them in simple\r\nwords and sentences.\r\n\r\nShe used their familiar occupations, and taught them to speak of\r\nfishing, metal-working, weaving, dyeing, and the preparation of food.\r\n\r\nAnd always after they had learned a certain thing, in speaking to them\r\nshe used English for that thing. The Folk, keen-witted and retentive\r\nof memory as barbarians often are, made astonishing strides in this\r\nnew language.\r\n\r\nThey realized fully now that it was the speech of their remote and\r\nsuperior ancestors, and that it far surpassed their own crude and\r\nlimited tongue.\r\n\r\nThus they learned with enthusiasm; and before long, among them in\r\ntheir own daily lives and labors, you could hear words, phrases, and\r\nbits of song in English. And at sound of this both Allan and the girl\r\nthrilled with pride and joy.\r\n\r\nAllan felt confident of ultimate success along this line.\r\n\r\n\"We must teach the children, above all,\" he said to her one day.\r\n\"English must come to be a secondary tongue to them, familiar as\r\nMerucaan. The next generation will speak English from birth and\r\ngradually the other language will decay and perish--save as we record\r\nit for the sake of history.\r\n\r\n\"It can't be otherwise, Beatrice. The superior tongue is always bound\r\nto replace the inferior. All the science and technical work I teach\r\nthese people must be explained in English.\r\n\r\n\"They have no words for all these things. Bridges, flying-machines,\r\nengines, water-pipes for the new aqueduct we're putting in to supply\r\nthe colony from the big spring up back there, tools, processes,\r\neverything of importance, will enforce English. The very trend of\r\ntheir whole evolution will drive them to it, even if they were\r\nunwilling, which they aren't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course,\" she answered. \"Yet, after all, we're only two--\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll be three soon.\"\r\n\r\nShe blushed.\r\n\r\n\"Three, then, if you say so. So few among so many--it will be a hard\r\nfight, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, but we shall win. Old man Adams and one or two others, at the\r\ntime of the mutiny of the 'Bounty' taught English to all their one or\r\ntwo score wives and numerous children on Pitcairn.\r\n\r\n\"The Tahitan was soon forgotten, and the brown half-breeds all spoke\r\ngood English right up to the time of the catastrophe, when, of course,\r\nthey were all wiped out. So you see, history proves the thing can be\r\ndone--and will be.\"\r\n\r\nCame an evening toward the beginning of spring again--an evening of\r\nsurpassing loveliness, soft, warm, perfumed with the first crimson\r\nblossoms of the season--when Bremilu ran swiftly up the path to the\r\ncliff-top and sought Allan in the palisaded enclosure, working with\r\nhis men on the new aqueduct.\r\n\r\n\"Come, master, for they seek you now!\" he panted.\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"The mistress and old Gesafam, the aged woman, skilled in all\r\nmaladies! Come swiftly, O Kromno!\"\r\n\r\nAllan started, dropped his lantern, and turned very white.\r\n\r\n\"You mean--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yea, master! Come!\"\r\n\r\nHe found Beatrice in bed, the bronze lamp shining on her face, pale as\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\n\"Come, boy!\" she whispered. \"Let me kiss you just once\r\nbefore--before--\"\r\n\r\nHe knelt, and on her brow his lips seemed to burn. She kissed him,\r\nthen with a smile of happiness in all her pain said:\r\n\r\n\"Go, dearest! You must go now!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as he lingered, old Gesafam, chattering shrilly, seized him by\r\nthe arm and pushed him toward the doorway.\r\n\r\nDazed and in silence he submitted. But when the door had closed behind\r\nhim, and he stood alone there in the moonlight above the rushing\r\nriver, a sudden exaltation thrilled him.\r\n\r\nHe knelt again by the rough sill and kissed the doorway of the house\r\nof pain, the house of life; and his soul flamed into prayer to\r\nwhatsoever Principle or Power wrought the mysteries of the\r\never-changing universe.\r\n\r\nAnd for hours, keeping all far away, he held his vigil; and the stars\r\nwatched above him, too, mysterious and far.\r\n\r\nBut with the coming of the dawn, hark! a cry within! The cry--the\r\nthrilling, never-to-be-forgotten, heart-wringing cry of the\r\nfirst-born!\r\n\r\n\"Oh, God!\" breathed Allan, while down his cheeks hot tears gushed\r\nunrestrained.\r\n\r\nThe door opened. Gesafam beckoned.\r\n\r\nTrembling, weak as a child, the man faltered in. Still burned the lamp\r\nupon the table. He saw the heavy masses of Beta's hair upon the pillow\r\nof deerskin, and something in his heart yearned toward her as never\r\nuntil now.\r\n\r\n\"Allan!\"\r\n\r\nChoking, unable to formulate a word, shaking, he sank beside the bed,\r\nburied his face upon it, and with his hand sought hers.\r\n\r\n\"Allan, behold your son!\"\r\n\r\nInto his quivering arms she laid a tiny bundle wrapped in the finest\r\ncloth the Folk could weave of soft palm-fibers.\r\n\r\nHis son!\r\n\r\nAgainst his face he held the child, sobbing. One hand sheltered it;\r\nthe other pressed the weak and trembling hand of Beatrice.\r\n\r\nAnd as the knowledge and the joy and pain of realization, of full\r\nachievement, of fatherhood, surged through him, the strong man's tears\r\nbaptized the future master of the race!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nDISASTER!\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening, the evening of the same day, Allan presented the\r\nman-child to his assembled Folk.\r\n\r\nEager, silent, awed, the white barbarians gathered on the terrace, all\r\nup and down the slope of it, before the door of their Kromno's house,\r\nwaiting to behold the son of him they all obeyed, of him who was their\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nAllan took the child and bore it to the doorway; and in the presence\r\nof all he held it up, and in the yellow moonlight dedicated it to\r\ntheir service and the service of the world.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, O folk of the Merucaans!\" he cried. \"I show you and I give\r\nyou, now, into your keeping and protection forever, this first-born\r\nchild of ours!\r\n\r\n\"This is the first American, the first of the ancient race that once\r\nwas, the same race whence you, too, have descended, to be born in the\r\nupper world! His name shall be my name--Allan. To him shall be taught\r\nall good and useful things of body and of mind. He shall be your\r\nmaster, but more than master; he shall be your friend, your teacher,\r\nyour strength, your guide in the days yet to come! To you his life is\r\ngiven. Not for himself shall he live, not for power or oppression, but\r\nfor service in the good of all!\r\n\r\n\"To you and your children is he given, to those who shall come after,\r\nto the new and better time. When we, his parents, and when you, too,\r\nshall all be gone from here, this man-child shall carry on the work\r\nwith your descendants. His race shall be your race, his love and care\r\nall for your welfare, his every thought and labor for the common good!\r\n\r\n\"Thus do I consecrate and give him to you, O my Folk! And from this\r\nhour of his naming I give you, too, a name. No longer shall you be\r\n_Merucaans_, but now _Americans_ again. The ancient name shall live\r\nonce more. He, an American, salutes you, Americans! You are his elder\r\nbrothers, and between you the bond shall never loosen till the end.\r\n\r\n\"I have spoken unto you. This is the Law!\"\r\n\r\nIn silence they received it, in silence made obeisance; and, as Allan\r\nonce more carried the child back to its mother, silently they all\r\ndeparted to their homes and labors.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment Allan believed his rule established now by stronger\r\nbonds of love than any force could be. And through all the\r\nintoxication of success and consummated power he felt a love for\r\nBeatrice, who had rendered all this possible, such as no human words\r\ncould ever say.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllan, Junior, grew lustily, waxed strong, and\r\nfilled the colony with joy. A new spirit pervaded Settlement Cliffs.\r\nThe vital fact of new life born there, an augury of strength and\r\nincrease and world-dominance once more, cemented all the social bonds.\r\n\r\nAn esprit de corps, an admirable and powerful cooperative sense\r\ndeveloped, and the work of reconstruction, of learning, of progress\r\nwent on more rapidly than ever.\r\n\r\nBeatrice, seated at the door of Cliff Villa with the child upon her\r\nknee, made a veritable heart and center for all thought and labor. She\r\nand Allan, Junior, became objects almost of worship for the simple\r\nFolk.\r\n\r\nIt was heart-touching to see the eager interest, the love and\r\nveneration of the people, the hesitant yet fascinated way in which\r\nthey contemplated this strange boy, blue-eyed and with yellow hair\r\nbeginning to grow already; this, the first child they had ever seen to\r\nshow them what the children of their one-time ancestors had been.\r\n\r\nThe hunters, now growing very expert in the use of firearms, fairly\r\noverloaded the larder of the villa with rare game-birds and venison.\r\nThe fishers outdid themselves to catch choice fish for their master's\r\nfamily. And every morning fruits and flowers were piled at the doorway\r\nfor their rulers' pleasure.\r\n\r\nEven then, when so much still remained to do, it seemed as though the\r\nGolden Age of Allan's dreams already was beginning to take form. These\r\nwere by far the happiest days Beta and he had ever lived. Love, work,\r\nhopes and plans filled their waking hours.\r\n\r\nPut far away were all discouragements and fears. All dangers seemed\r\nforever to have vanished. Even the portent of the signal-fires, from\r\ntime to time seen on the northern or eastern horizons, were ignored.\r\nAnd for a while all was peace and joy.\r\n\r\nHow little they foresaw the future; how little realized the terrible,\r\nthe inevitable events now already closing down about them!\r\n\r\nAllan made no further trips into the Abyss for about two months and a\r\nhalf. Before bringing any more of the people to the surface, he\r\npreferred to put all things in readiness for their reception.\r\n\r\nHe now had a working force of fifty-four men and twelve women.\r\nIncluding his own son, there were some seven children at Settlement\r\nCliffs. The labor of civilization waxed apace.\r\n\r\nWith large plans in view, he dammed the rapids and set up a small mill\r\nand power-plant, the precursor of a far larger one in the future.\r\nVarious short flights to the ruins of neighboring towns put him in\r\npossession, bit by bit, of machinery which he could adapt into needful\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nIn a year or two he knew he would have to clear land and make\r\npreparations for agriculture. A grist-mill would soon be essential. He\r\ncould not always depend upon the woods and streams for food for the\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nThere must be cultivation of fruits and grains; the taming of wild\r\nfowl, cattle, horses, sheep and goats--but no swine; and a regular\r\nevolution up through the stages again by which the society of the past\r\nhad reached its climax.\r\n\r\nAnd to his ears the whirring of his turbine as the waters of New Hope\r\nRiver swirled through the penstocks, the spinning of the wheels, the\r\nslapping of the deerskin belting, made music only second to the voices\r\nof Beatrice and his son.\r\n\r\nAllan brought piecemeal and fitted up a small dynamo from some\r\nextensive ruins to southeastward. He brought wiring and several still\r\nintact incandescent lights. Before long Cliff Villa shone resplendent,\r\nto the awe and marvel of the Folk.\r\n\r\nBut Allan made no mystery of it. He explained it all to Zangamon,\r\nBremilu and H'yemba, the smith; and when they seemed to understand,\r\nbade them tell the rest.\r\n\r\nThus every day some new improvement was installed, or some fresh\r\nknowledge spread among the colonists.\r\n\r\nJune had drawn on again, and the hot weather had become oppressive,\r\nbefore Allan thought once more of still further trips into the Abyss.\r\nBeatrice tried to dissuade him. Her heart shrank from further\r\nseparation, risk and fear.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, dearest,\" she entreated as they sat by young Allan's bedside,\r\none sultry, breathless night. \"I think you've risked enough; really I\r\ndo. You've got a boy now to keep you here, even if I can't! Please\r\ndon't go! Follow out the plan you spoke to me about yesterday, but\r\ndon't go yourself!\"\r\n\r\n\"The plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, _you_ know. Your idea of training three or four of the most\r\nintelligent men to fly, and perhaps building one or two more\r\nplanes--that is, establishing a regular service to and from the Abyss.\r\nThat would be so much wiser, Allan! Think how deadly imprudent it is\r\nfor you, you personally, to take this risk every time! Why, if\r\nanything should happen--\"\r\n\r\n\"But it won't! It can't!\"\r\n\r\n\"--What would become of the colony? We haven't got anything like\r\nenough of a start to go ahead with, lacking you! I speak now without\r\nsentiment or foolish, womanly fears, but just on a common-sense,\r\npractical basis. Viewed at that angle, ought you to take the risk\r\nagain?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no time now, darling, to build more planes! No time to teach\r\nflying! We've got to recruit the colony as fast as possible, in case\r\nof emergencies. Why, I haven't made a trip since--since God knows\r\nwhen! It's time I was off now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Allan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you _never_ went again? With the population we now have, and\r\nthe natural increase, wouldn't civilization reestablish itself in\r\ntime?\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly. But think how long it would take! Every additional\r\nperson imported puts us ahead tremendously. I may never be able to\r\nbring all the Folk, all the Lanskaarn, and those other mysterious\r\nyellow-haired people they talk about from beyond the Great Vortex. But\r\nI can do my share, anyhow. Our boy here may have to complete the\r\nprocess. It may take a lifetime to accomplish the rescue, but it must\r\nbe done!\"\r\n\r\n\"So you're determined to go again?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am! I must!\"\r\n\r\nShe seized his hand imploringly.\r\n\r\n\"And leave us? Leave your boy? Leave _me?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Only to return soon, darling! Very soon!\"\r\n\r\n\"But after this one trip, will you promise to train somebody else to\r\ngo in your place?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see, dearest!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! Not that! Promise!\"\r\n\r\nShe had drawn his head down, and now her face close to his, was\r\ntrembling in her eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"Promise! Promise me, Allan! You must!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly moved by her entreaty, he yielded.\r\n\r\n\"I promise, Beta!\" he exclaimed. \"Gad, I didn't know you were so\r\ndeadly afraid of my little expeditions! If I'd understood, I might\r\nhave been arranging otherwise already. But I certainly will change\r\nmatters when I get back. Only let me go once more, darling--that'll be\r\nthe last time, I swear it to you!\"\r\n\r\nShe gave a great sigh of relief unspeakable and kept silence. But in\r\nher eyes he saw the shine of sudden tears.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllan had been gone more than four days and a\r\nhalf before Beatrice allowed herself to realize or to acknowledge the\r\nsick terror that for some hours had been growing in her soul.\r\n\r\nHis usual time of return had hitherto been just a little over three\r\ndays. Sometimes, with favorable winds to the brink of the Abyss, and\r\nunusually strong rising currents of vapors from the sunken sea--from\r\nthe Vortex, perhaps?--he had been able to make the round trip in sixty\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nBut now over a hundred and eight hours had lagged by since Beatrice,\r\ncarrying the boy, had accompanied him up the steep path to the hangar\r\nin the palisaded clearing.\r\n\r\nHow light-hearted, confident, strong he had been, filled with great\r\ndreams and hopes and visions! No thought of peril, accident, or\r\npossible failure had clouded his mind.\r\n\r\nShe recalled his farewell kiss given to the child and to herself, his\r\ncareful inspection of the machine, his short and vigorous orders, and\r\nthe supreme skill with which he had leaped aloft upon its back and\r\ngone whirring up the sky till distance far to the northwestward had\r\nswallowed him.\r\n\r\nAnd since that hour no sign of return. No speck against the blue. No\r\nwelcome chatter of the engine far aloft, no hum of huge blades beating\r\nthe summer air! Nothing!\r\n\r\nNothing save ever-growing fear and anguish, vain hopes, fruitless\r\npeerings toward the dim horizon, agonizing expectations always\r\nfrustrated, a vast and swiftly growing terror.\r\n\r\nBeatrice cringed from her own thoughts. She dared not face the truth.\r\n\r\nFor that way, she felt instinctively, lay madness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nALLAN RETURNS NOT\r\n\r\n\r\nFive days dragged past, then six, then seven, and still no sign\r\nof Allan came to lighten the terrible and growing anguish of the\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nAll day long now she would watch for him--save at such times as the\r\ncare and nursing of her child mercifully distracted her attention a\r\nlittle while from the intolerable grief and woe consuming her.\r\n\r\nShe would stand for hours on the rock terrace, peering into the\r\nnorthwest; she would climb the steep path a dozen times a day, and in\r\ndistraction pace the cliff-top inside the palisaded area, where now\r\nsome few wild sheep and goats were penned in process of domestication.\r\n\r\nHere she would walk, calling in vain his name to the uncaring winds of\r\nheaven. With the telescope she would untiringly sweep the far reaches\r\nof the horizon, hoping, ever hoping, that at each moment a vague and\r\ndistant speck might spring to view, wing its swift way southeastward,\r\nresolve itself into that one and only blessed sight her whole soul\r\ncraved and burned for--the Pauillac and her husband!\r\n\r\nAnd so, till night fell, and her strained eyes could no longer\r\ndistinguish anything but swimming mists and vapors, she would watch,\r\nher every thought a prayer, her every hope a torment--for each hope\r\nwas destined only to end in disappointment bitterer far than death.\r\n\r\nAnd when the shrouding dark had robbed her of all possibility for\r\nfurther watching she would descend with slow and halting steps,\r\ngrief-broken, dazed, half-maddened, to the home-cavern--empty now, in\r\nspite of her child's presence there--empty, and terrible, and drear!\r\n\r\nThen would begin the long night vigil. Daylight gave some simulacrum\r\nof relief in action, some slight deadening of pain in the very\r\nsearching of the sky, the strong, determined hope against what had now\r\nbecome an inner conviction of defeat and utter loss. But night--\r\n\r\nNight! Nothing, then, but to sit and think, and think, and think, to\r\nmadness! Sleep was impossible. At most, exhausted nature snatched only\r\na few brief spells of semi-consciousness.\r\n\r\nEven the sight of the boy, lying there sunk in his deep and healthy\r\nslumber, only kindled fresh fires of woe. For he was Allan's child--he\r\nspoke to her by his mere presence of the absent, the lost, perhaps the\r\ndead man.\r\n\r\nAnd at thought that now she might be already widowed and her boy\r\nfatherless, she would pace the rock-floor in terrible, writhen crises\r\nof agony, hands clenched till the nails pierced the delicate flesh,\r\neyes staring, face waxen, only for the sake of the child suppressing\r\nthe sobs and heart-torn cries that sought to burst from her\r\noverburdened soul.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Allan! Allan!\" she would entreat, as though he could know and\r\nhear. \"Oh, come back to me! What has happened? Where are you? Come\r\nback, come back to your boy--to me!\"\r\n\r\nThen, betimes, she would catch up the child and strain it to her\r\nbreast, even though it awakened. Its cries would mingle with her\r\nanguished weeping; and in the firelit gloom of the cave they two--she\r\nwho knew, and he who knew not--would in some measure comfort one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day she sustained a terrible shock, a sudden joy\r\nfollowed by so poignant a despair that for a moment it seemed to her\r\nhuman nature could endure no more and she must die.\r\n\r\nFor, eagerly watching the cloud-patched sky with the telescope, from\r\nthe cliff-top--while on the terrace old Gesafam tended the child--she\r\nthought suddenly to behold a distant vision of the aeroplane!\r\n\r\nA tiny spot in the heavens, truly, was moving across the field of\r\nvision!\r\n\r\nWith a cry, a sudden flushing of her face, now so wan and colorless,\r\nshe seemed to throw all her senses into one sense, the power of sight.\r\nAnd though her hand began to shake so terribly that she could only\r\nwith a great effort hold the glass, she steadied it against a\r\nfern-tree and thus managed to find again and hold the moving speck.\r\n\r\nThe Pauillac! Was it indeed the Pauillac and Allan?\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Heaven!\" she stammered. \"Bring him back--to me!\"\r\n\r\nAgain she watched, her whole soul aflame with hope and eagerness and\r\ntremulous joy, ready to burst into a blaze of happiness--and then came\r\ndisillusion and despair, blacker than ever and more terrible.\r\n\r\nFor suddenly the moving speck turned, wheeled and rose. One second she\r\ncaught sight of wings. She knew now it was only some huge, tropic\r\nbird, afar on the horizon--some condor, vulture, or other creature of\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nThen, as with a quick swoop, the vulture slid away and vanished behind\r\na blue hill-shoulder, the woman dropped her glass, sank to earth,\r\nand--half-fainting--burst into a terrible, dry, sobbing plaint. Her\r\ntears, long since exhausted, would not flow. Grief could pass no\r\nfurther limits.\r\n\r\nAfter a time she grew calmer, arose and thought of her child once\r\nmore. Slowly she returned down the via dolorosa of the terrace-path,\r\nthe walk where she and Allan had so often and so gaily trodden; the\r\npath now so barren, so hateful, so solitary.\r\n\r\nTo her little son she returned, and in her arms she cherished him--in\r\nher trembling arms--and the tears came at last, welcome and\r\nheart-stilling.\r\n\r\nOld Gesafam, gazing compassionately with troubled eyes that blinked\r\nbehind their mica shields, laid a comforting hand on the girl's\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Do not weep, O Yulcia, mistress!\" she exclaimed in her own tongue.\r\n\"Weep not, for there is still hope. See, all things are going on, as\r\nbefore, in the colony!\" She gestured toward the lower caves, whence\r\nthe sounds of smithy-work and other toil drifted upward. \"All is yet\r\nwell with us. Only our Kromno is away. And he will yet come! He will\r\ncome back to us--to the child, to you, to all who love and obey him!\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice seized the old woman's hand and kissed it in a burst of\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--if I could only believe you!\" she sobbed.\r\n\r\n\"It will be so! What could happen to him, so strong, so brave? He must\r\ncome back! He will!\"\r\n\r\n\"What could happen? A hundred things, Gesafam! One tiny break in the\r\nflying boat and he might be hurled to earth or down the Abyss, to\r\ndeath! Or, among your Folk, he may have been defeated, for many of the\r\nFolk are still savage and very cruel! Or, the Horde--\"\r\n\r\n\"The Horde? But the Horde, of which you have so often spoken, is now\r\nafar.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Gesafam. Even to-day I saw their signal-fires on the horizon.\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman drew an arm about the girl. All barbarian that she was,\r\nthe eternal, universal spirit of the feminine, pervading her, made her\r\nakin with the sorrowing wife.\r\n\r\n\"Go rest,\" she whispered. \"I understand. I, too have wept and mourned,\r\nthough that was very long ago in the Abyss. My man, my Nausaak, a very\r\nbrave and strong catcher of fish, fought with the Lanskaarn--and he\r\ndied. I understand, Yulcia! You must think no more of this now. The\r\nchild needs your strength. You must rest. Go!\"\r\n\r\nGently, yet with firmness that was not to be disputed, she forced\r\nBeatrice into the cave, made her lie down, and prepared a drink for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThough Beta knew it not, the wise old woman had steeped therein a few\r\nleaves of the ronyilu weed, brought from the Abyss, a powerful\r\nsoporific. And presently a certain calm and peace began to win\r\npossession of her soul.\r\n\r\nFor a time, however, distressing visions still continued to float\r\nbefore her disordered mind. Now she seemed to behold the Pauillac,\r\nflaming and shattered, whirling down, over and over, meteor-swift,\r\ninto the purple mists and vapors of the Abyss.\r\n\r\nNow the scene changed; and she saw it, crushed and broken, lying on\r\nsome far rock-ledge, amid impenetrable forests, while from beneath a\r\nformless tangle of wreckage protruded a hand--his hand--and a thin,\r\ndripping stream of red.\r\n\r\nGasping, she sought to struggle up and stare about her; but the\r\ndrugged draft was too potent, and she could not move. Yet still the\r\nvisions came again--and now it seemed that Allan lay there, in the\r\nwoods, somewhere afar, transfixed with an envenomed spear, while in a\r\ncrowding, hideous, jabbering swarm the distorted, beast-like\r\nanthropoids jostled triumphantly all about him, hacked at him with\r\nflints and knives, flayed and dismembered him, inflicted unimaginable\r\nmutilations--\r\n\r\nShe knew no more. Thanks to the wondrous beneficence of the ronyilu,\r\nshe slept a deep and dreamless slumber. Even the child being laid on\r\nher breast by the old woman--who smiled, though in her eyes stood\r\ntears--even this did not arouse her.\r\n\r\nShe slept. And for a few blessed hours she had respite from woe and\r\npain unspeakable.\r\n\r\nAt last her dreams grew troubled. She seemed caught in a\r\nthunder-storm, an earthquake. She heard the smashing of the lightning\r\nbolts, the roaring shock of the reverberation, then the crash of\r\nshattered buildings.\r\n\r\nA sudden shock awoke her. She thought a falling block of stone had\r\nstruck her arm. But it was only old Gesafam shaking her in terror.\r\n\r\n\"_Oh, Yulcia, noa!_\" the nurse was crying in terror. \"Up! Waken! The\r\ncliff falls! Awake, awake!\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice sat up in bed, conscious through all the daze of dreams quick\r\nbroken, that some calamity--some vast and unknown peril--had smitten\r\nthe colony at Settlement Cliffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE TREASON OF H'YEMBA\r\n\r\n\r\nNot yet even fully awake, Beatrice was conscious of a sudden,\r\nvast responsibility laid on her shoulders. She felt the thrill of\r\nleadership and command, for in her hands alone now rested the fate of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nOut of bed she sprang, her grief for the moment crushed aside, aquiver\r\nnow with the spirit of defense against all ills that might menace the\r\ncolony and her child.\r\n\r\n\"The cliff falls?\" she cried, starting for the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Yea, mistress! Hark!\"\r\n\r\nBoth women heard a grating, crushing sound. The whole fabric of the\r\ncavern trembled again, as though shuddering; then, far below, a\r\ngrinding crash reechoed--and now rose shouts, cries, wails of pain.\r\n\r\nAlready Beatrice was out of the door and running down the terrace.\r\n\r\n\"Yulcia! Yulcia!\" the old woman stood screaming after her. \"You must\r\nnot go!\"\r\n\r\nShe answered nothing, but ran the faster. Already she could see dust\r\nrising from the river-brink; and louder now the cries blended in an\r\nanguished chorus as she sped down the terrace.\r\n\r\nWhat could have happened? How great was the catastrophe? What might\r\nthe death-roll be?\r\n\r\nHer terrors about Allan had at last been thrown into the background of\r\nher mind. She forgot the boy, herself, everything save the crushing\r\nfact of some stupendous calamity.\r\n\r\nAll at once she stopped with a gasp of terror.\r\n\r\nShe had reached the turn in the path whence now all the further reach\r\nof the cliff was visible. But, where the crag had towered, now\r\nappeared only a great and jagged rent in the limestone, through which\r\nthe sky peered down.\r\n\r\nAn indescribable chaos of fragments, blocks, debris, detritus of all\r\nkinds half choked the river below; and the swift current, suddenly\r\nblocked, now foamed and chafed with lathering fury through the newly\r\nfallen obstacle.\r\n\r\nBroken short off, the path stopped not a hundred yards in front of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAs she stood there, dazed and dumb, harkening the terrible cries that\r\nrose from those still not dead in the ruins, she perceived some of the\r\nFolk gathered along the brink of the new chasm. More and more kept\r\ncoming from the scant half of the caves still left. And all, dazed and\r\nnumbed like herself, stood there peering down with vacant looks.\r\n\r\nBeatrice first recovered wit. Dimly she understood the truth. The\r\ncavern digging of the Folk, the burrowing and honeycombing through the\r\ncliff, must have sprung some keystone, started some \"fault,\" or broken\r\ndown some vital rib of the structure.\r\n\r\nWith irresistible might it had torn loose, slid, crashed, leaped into\r\nthe canyon, carrying with it how many lives she knew not.\r\n\r\nAll she knew now was that rescues must be made of such as still lived,\r\nand that the bodies of the dead must be recovered.\r\n\r\nSo with fresh strength, utterly forgetful of self, she ran once more\r\ndown the steep terrace, calling to her folk:\r\n\r\n\"Men! My people! Down to the river, quickly! Take hammers, bars,\r\ntools--go swiftly! Save the wounded! Go!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no sleep for any in the colony that day, that night, or the\r\nnext day. The vast pile of debris rang with the sledge blows, louder\r\nthan ever anvil rang, and the torches flared and sparkled over the\r\njumble of broken rock, beneath which now lay buried many dead--none\r\nknew how many--nevermore to be seen of man. Great iron bars bent\r\ndouble with the prying of strong arms.\r\n\r\nBeatrice herself, flambeau in hand, directed the labor. And as, one by\r\none, the wounded and the broken were released, she ordered them borne\r\nto the great cave of Bremilu, the Strong.\r\n\r\nBremilu had been in the house of one Jukkos at the time of the\r\ncatastrophe. His body was one of the first to be found. Beta\r\ntransformed his cave into a hospital.\r\n\r\nAnd there, working with the help of three or four women, hampered in\r\nevery way for lack of proper materials, she labored hour after hour\r\ndressing wounds, setting broken bones, watching no few die, even\r\ndespite the best that she could do.\r\n\r\nOld Gesafam came to seek her there with news that the child cried of\r\nhunger. Dazed, Beta went to nurse it; and then returned, in spite of\r\nthe old woman's pleadings; and so a long time passed--how long she\r\nnever knew.\r\n\r\nDisaster! This was her one clear realization through all those hours\r\nof dark and labor, anguish and despair. For the first time the girl\r\nfelt beaten.\r\n\r\nTill now, through every peril, exposure and hardship, she had kept\r\nhope and courage. Allan had always been beside her--wise, and very\r\nstrong to counsel and to act.\r\n\r\nBut now, alone there--all alone in face of this sudden\r\ndevastation--she felt at the end of her resources. She had to struggle\r\nto hold her reason, to use her native judgment, common sense and\r\nskill.\r\n\r\nThe work of rescue came to an end at last. All were saved who could\r\nbe. All the bodies that could be reached had been carried into still\r\nanother cave, not far from the path of the disaster. All the wounds\r\nand injuries had been dressed, and now Beatrice knew her force was at\r\nan end. She could do no more.\r\n\r\nDrained of energy, spent, broken, she dragged herself up the path\r\nagain. In front of the cave of H'yemba, the smith, a group of\r\nsurvivors had gathered.\r\n\r\nDimly she sensed that the ugly fellow was haranguing them with loud\r\nand bitter words. As she came past, the speech died; but many lowering\r\nand evil looks were cast on her, and a low murmur--sullen and\r\nominous--followed her on up the terrace.\r\n\r\nToo exhausted even to note it or to care, she staggered back to Cliff\r\nVilla, flung herself on the bed, and slept.\r\n\r\nHow long? She could not tell when she awoke again. Only she knew that\r\na dim light, as of evening, was glimmering in at the doorway, and that\r\nher child was in the bed beside her.\r\n\r\n\"Gesafam!\" she called, for she heard some one moving in the cave.\r\n\"Bring me water!\"\r\n\r\nThere came no answer. Beta repeated the command. A curious, sneering\r\nmockery startled her. Still clad in her loose brown cloak, belted at\r\nthe waist--for she had thrown herself upon the bed fully clad--she sat\r\nup, peering by the light of the fireplace into the half dark of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nA third time she called the old woman.\r\n\r\n\"It is useless!\" cried a voice. \"She will not come to help you. See, I\r\nhave bound her--and now she lies in that further chamber of the cave,\r\nhelpless. For it is not with her I would speak, but with you. And you\r\nshall hear me.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'yemba!\" cried Beatrice, startled, suddenly recognizing the squat\r\nand brutal figure that now, a threat in every gesture, approached the\r\nbed. \"Out! Out of here, I say! How dare you enter my house? You shall\r\npay heavily for this great insult when the master comes. Out and\r\naway!\"\r\n\r\nThe ugly fellow only laughed menacingly.\r\n\r\n\"No, I shall not go, and there will be no payment,\" he retorted in his\r\nown speech. \"And you must hear me, for now I, and not he, shall be the\r\nmaster here.\"\r\n\r\nBeta sprang from the bed and faced him.\r\n\r\n\"Go, or I shoot you down like a dog!\" she threatened.\r\n\r\nHe sneered.\r\n\r\n\"There will be no shooting,\" he answered coolly. \"But there will be\r\nspeech for you to hear. Now listen! _This_ is what ye brought us here\r\nto? The man and you? _This?_ To death and woe? To accidents and\r\nperishings?\r\n\r\n\"Ye brought us to hardship and to battle, not to peace! With lies,\r\ndeceptions and false promises ye enticed us! We were safe and happy in\r\nour homes in the Abyss beside the sunless sea, till _ye_ fell thither\r\nin your air-boat from these cursed regions. We--\"\r\n\r\n\"For this speech ye shall surely die when the master comes!\" cried\r\nshe. \"This is treason, and the penalty of it is death!\"\r\n\r\nHe continued, paying no heed:\r\n\r\n\"We had no need of you, your ways, or your place. But the man Allan\r\nwould rule or he would ruin. He overthrew and killed our chief, the\r\ngreat Kamrou himself--Kamrou the Terrible! To us he brought\r\ndissensions. From us he bore the patriarch away and slew him, and then\r\nmade us a great falsehood in that matter.\r\n\r\n\"So he enticed us all. And ye behold the great disaster and the death!\r\nThe man Allan has deserted us all to perish here. Coward in his heart,\r\nhe has abandoned _you_ as well! Gone once more to safety and ease,\r\nbelow in the Abyss, there to rule the rest of the Folk, there to take\r\nwives according to our law, while _we_ die here!\"\r\n\r\nMenacingly he advanced toward the dumb-stricken woman, his face ablaze\r\nwith evil passion.\r\n\r\n\"Gremnya!\" (coward) he shouted. \"Weakling at heart. Great boaster,\r\ndoer of little deeds! Even you, who would be our mistress, he has\r\nabandoned--even his own son he has forsaken. A rotten breed, truly!\r\nAnd we die!\r\n\r\n\"But listen now. This shall not be! I, H'yemba, the smith, the\r\nstrongest of all, will not permit it. I will be ruler here, if any\r\nlive to be ruled! And you shall be my serving-maid--your son my\r\nslave!\"\r\n\r\nAghast, struck dumb by this wild tempest of rebellion, Beatrice\r\nrecoiled. His face showed like a white blur in the gloom.\r\n\r\n\"Allan!\" she gasped. \"My Allan--\"\r\n\r\nThe huge smith laughed a venomous laugh that echoed through the cave.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Ye call on the coward?\" he mocked, advancing on her. \"On the\r\ncoward who cannot hear, and would not save you if he could? Behold now\r\nye shall kneel to me and call me master! And my words from now ye\r\nshall obey!\"\r\n\r\nShe snatched for her pistol. It was not there. In the excitement of\r\nthe past hours she had forgotten to buckle it on. She was unarmed.\r\n\r\nH'yemba already grasped for her, to force her down upon the floor,\r\nkneeling to him--to make her call him master.\r\n\r\nAlready his strong and hairy fingers had all but seized her robe.\r\n\r\nBut she, lithe and agile, evaded the grip. To the fire she sprang. She\r\ncaught up a flaming stick that lay upon the hearth. With a cry she\r\ndashed it full into his glaring eyes.\r\n\r\nSo sudden was the attack that H'yemba had no time even to ward it off\r\nwith his hands. Fair in the face the scorching flame struck home.\r\n\r\nHowling, blinded, stricken, he staggered back; beat the air with vain\r\nblows and retreated toward the door.\r\n\r\nAs he went he poured upon her a torrent of the most hideous\r\nimprecations known to their speech--and they were many.\r\n\r\nBut she, undaunted now, feeling her power and her strength again,\r\nfollowed close. And like blows of a flail, the sputtering, flaring\r\nflame beat down upon his head, neck, shoulders.\r\n\r\nHis hair was blazing now; a smell of scorched flesh diffused itself\r\nthrough the cavern.\r\n\r\n\"Go! _Go, dog!_\" she shouted, maddened and furious, in consuming rage\r\nand hate. \"Coward! Slanderer and liar! Go, ere I kill you now!\"\r\n\r\nIn panic-stricken fright, unable to see, trying in vain to ward off\r\nthe devastating, torturing whip of flame and to extinguish the fire\r\nravaging his hair, the brute half ran, half fell out of the cave.\r\n\r\nDown the steep path he staggered, yelling curses; down, away,\r\nanywhere--away from this pursuing fury.\r\n\r\nBut the woman, outraged in all her inmost sacred tendernesses, her\r\nlove for child and husband, still drove him with the blazing\r\nscourge--drove, till the torch was beaten to extinction--drove, till\r\nthe smith took refuge in his own cave.\r\n\r\nThere, being spent and weary, she let him lie and howl. Exhausted,\r\nterribly shaken in body and soul, yet her eyes triumphant, she once\r\nmore climbed the precipitous path to her own dwelling. The torch she\r\nflung away, down the canyon into the river.\r\n\r\nShe ran to the far recess of the cave, found Gesafam indeed bound and\r\nhelpless, and quickly freed her.\r\n\r\nThe old woman was shaking like a leaf, and could give no coherent\r\naccount of what had happened. Beta made her lie down on the couch, and\r\nherself prepared a bowl of hot broth for the faithful nurse.\r\n\r\nThen she bethought herself of the pistol Allan had given her.\r\n\r\n\"I must never take that off again, whatever happens,\" said she.\r\n\"But--where is it now?\"\r\n\r\nIn vain she hunted for it on the table, the floor, the shelves, and in\r\nthe closets Allan had built. In vain she ransacked the whole cave.\r\n\r\nThe pistol, belt, and cartridges--all were gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN OF THE MASTER\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly finding herself very much alarmed and shaken, Beatrice\r\nsat down in the low chair beside her bed, and covering her face with\r\nboth hands tried to think.\r\n\r\nThe old woman, somewhat recovered, moved about with words of pity and\r\nindignation, and sought to make speech with her, but she paid no heed.\r\nNow, if ever, she had need of self-searching--of courage and\r\nenterprise. And all at once she found that, despite everything, she\r\nwas only a woman.\r\n\r\nHer passion spent, she felt a desperate need of a man's strength,\r\nadvice, support. In disarray she sat there, striving to collect her\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nHer robe was torn, and her loosened hair, escaping from its golden\r\npins, cascaded all about her shoulders. Loudly her heart throbbed; a\r\ncertain shivering had taken possession of her, and all at once she\r\nnoticed that her brow was burning.\r\n\r\nResolutely she tried to put her weakness from her, and marshalled her\r\nthoughts. In the bed her son still slept quietly, his fat fist\r\nprotruding from the clothes, his ruddy, healthy little face half\r\nburied in the pillow.\r\n\r\nA great, overpowering wave of mother-love swept her heart. She leaned\r\nforward, and through lids now tear-dimmed, with eyes no longer angry,\r\npeered at the child--her child and Allan's.\r\n\r\n\"For your sake--for yours if not for mine,\" she whispered, \"I must be\r\nstrong!\"\r\n\r\nShe thought.\r\n\r\n\"Evidently some great conspiracy is going on here. Beyond and apart\r\nfrom the calamity of the landslide, some other and even greater peril\r\nmenaces the colony!\"\r\n\r\nShe reflected on the incident of her pistol and ammunition being\r\nstolen.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt that H'yemba did that,\" she decided. \"In the\r\nconfusion of the catastrophe he has disarmed me. That means\r\nwell-planned rebellion--and at this time it will be fatal! Now, above\r\nall else, we must work in harmony, stand fast, close up the ranks!\r\nThis must not be!\"\r\n\r\nYet she could see no way clear to crush the danger. What could she do\r\nagainst so many--nearly all provided with firearms? Why had H'yemba\r\neven taken the trouble to steal her weapon?\r\n\r\n\"Coward!\" she exclaimed. \"Afraid for his own life--afraid even to face\r\nme, so long as I had a pistol! As I live, and heaven is above me, in\r\ncase of civil war he shall be the first to die!\"\r\n\r\nShe summoned Gesafam.\r\n\r\n\"Go, now!\" she commanded; \"go among the remaining Folk and secretly\r\nfind me a pistol, with ammunition. Steal them if you must. Say\r\nnothing, and return as quickly as you can. There be many guns among\r\nthe Folk. I must have one. Go!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, Yulcia, will there be fighting again?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not. Ask no questions, but obey!\"\r\n\r\nTrembling--shaking her head and muttering strange things, the old\r\nwoman departed.\r\n\r\nShe returned in a quarter-hour with not only one, but two pistols and\r\nseveral ammunition-belts cleverly concealed beneath her robe. Beta\r\nseized them gladly with a sudden return of confidence.\r\n\r\nBut the old woman, though she said no word, eyed her mistress in a\r\nstrange, disquieting manner. What had she heard, or seen, down in the\r\ncaves? Beatrice had now neither time nor inclination to ask.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, old mother,\" she commanded. \"I am now going to leave you and\r\nmy son here together. After I am gone lock the door. Let no one in. I\r\nalone shall enter. My signal shall be two knocks on the door, then a\r\npause, then three. Do not open till you hear that signal. You\r\nunderstand me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand and I obey, O Yulcia noa!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well. Guard my son as your life. Now I go to see the wounded\r\nand the sick again!\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman let her out and carefully barred the door behind her.\r\nBeatrice, unafraid, with both her weapons lying loose in their\r\nholsters, belted under her robe, advanced alone down the terrace path.\r\n\r\nHer hair had once more been bound up. She had recovered something of\r\nher poise and strength. The realization of her mission inspired her to\r\nany sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\"It's all for your sake, Allan,\" she whispered as she went. \"All for\r\nyours--and our boy's!\"\r\n\r\nFar beneath her New Hope River purled and sparkled in the morning sun.\r\nBeyond, the far and vivid tropic forest stretched in wild beauty to\r\nthe hills that marked the world's end--those hills beyond which--\r\n\r\nShe put away the thought, refusing to admit even the possibility of\r\nAllan's failure, or accident, or death.\r\n\r\n\"He will come back to me!\" she said bravely and proudly, for a moment\r\nstopping to face the sun. \"He will come back from beyond those hills\r\nand trackless woods! He will come back--to us!\"\r\n\r\nAgain she turned, and descending some dozen steps in the terrace path,\r\nonce more reached the doorway of the hospital cave.\r\n\r\nPausing not, hesitating not, she lifted the rude latch and pushed.\r\n\r\nThe door refused to give.\r\n\r\nAgain she tried more forcibly.\r\n\r\nIt still resisted.\r\n\r\nThrowing all her strength against the barrier, she fought to thrust it\r\ninward. It would not budge.\r\n\r\n\"Barred!\" she exclaimed, aghast.\r\n\r\nOnly too true. During her absence, though how or by whom she could not\r\nknow, the door had been impassably closed to keep her out!\r\n\r\nWho, now, was working against her will? Could it be that H'yemba, all\r\nburned and blinded as he was, could have returned so soon and once\r\nmore set himself to thwart her? And if not the smith, then who?\r\n\r\n\"Rebellion!\" she exclaimed. \"It's spreading--growing--now, at the very\r\nminute when I should have help, faith and cooperation!\r\n\r\n\"Open! Open, in the name of the law that has been given you--our law!\"\r\nshe cried loudly in the Merucaan tongue.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nShe snatched out a pistol, and with the butt loudly smote the planks\r\nof palm-wood. Within, the echoes rumbled dully, but no human voice\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"Traitors! Cowards!\" she defied the opposing power. \"I, a woman, your\r\nmistress, am come to save you, and you bar me out! Woe on you! Woe!\"\r\n\r\nWaiting not, but now with greater haste, she ran down along the\r\npathway toward the next door.\r\n\r\nThat, too, was sealed. And the next, and the fourth, and all, every\r\none, both on the upper and the lower terrace, all--all were\r\nbarricaded, even to the great gap made by the landslide.\r\n\r\nFrom within no sound, no reply, no slightest sign that any heard or\r\nnoticed her. Dumb, mute, passive, invincible rebellion!\r\n\r\nIn vain she called, commanded, pleaded, explained, entreated. No\r\nanswer. The white barbarians, all banded against her now, had shut\r\nthemselves up with their wounded and their dying, to wait their\r\ndestiny alone.\r\n\r\nHow many were already dead? How many might yet be saved, who would die\r\nwithout her help? She could not tell. The uncertainty maddened her.\r\n\r\n\"If they den up, that way,\" she said, \"pestilence may break out among\r\nthem and all may die! And then what? If I'm left all alone in the\r\nwilderness with Gesafam and the boy--what then?\"\r\n\r\nThe thought was too horrible for contemplation. So many blows had\r\ncrashed home to her soul the past week--even the past few hours--that\r\nthe girl felt numbed and dazed as in a nightmare.\r\n\r\nIt was, it must be, all some frightful unreality--Allan's absence, the\r\navalanche, H'yemba's attack, and this widespread, silent defiance of\r\nher power.\r\n\r\nOnly a few days before Allan had been there with her--strong,\r\nvigorous, confident.\r\n\r\nAuthority had been supreme. Labor, content, prosperity had reigned.\r\nHealth and life and vigor had been everywhere. On the horizon of\r\nexistence no cloud; none over the sun of progress.\r\n\r\nAnd now, suddenly--annihilation!\r\n\r\nWith a groan that was a sob, her face drawn and pale, eyes fixed and\r\nunseeing, Beatrice turned back up the terrace path, back up the steep,\r\ntoward the only door still at her command--Hope Villa.\r\n\r\nBack toward the only one of these strange Folk still loyal; back\r\ntoward her child.\r\n\r\nHer head felt strangely giddy. The depths at her left hand, below the\r\nparapet of stone, seemed to be calling--calling insistently. Before\r\nher sight something like a veil was drawn; and yet it was not a veil,\r\nbut a peculiar haze, now and then intershot with sparkles of pale\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThrough her mind flittered for the first time something like an\r\nadequate realization of the vast, abysmal gulf in culture-status still\r\nyawning between these barbarians and Allan and herself.\r\n\r\n\"Civilization,\" she stammered in an odd voice; \"why that\r\nmeans--generations!\"\r\n\r\nAll at once she wondered if she were going to faint. A sudden pain had\r\nstabbed her temples; a humming had attacked her ears.\r\n\r\nShe put out her hand against the rock wall of the cliff at the right\r\nto steady herself. Her mouth felt hot and very dry.\r\n\r\n\"I--I must get back home,\" she said weakly. \"I'm not at all well--this\r\nmorning. Overexertion--\"\r\n\r\nPainfully she began to climb the stepped path toward the upper level\r\nand Cliff Villa. And again it seemed to her the depths were calling;\r\nbut now she felt positive she heard a voice--a voice she knew but\r\ncould not exactly place--a hail very far away yet near--all very\r\nstrange, unreal and terrifying.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--am I going to be ill?\" she panted. \"No, no! I mustn't! For the\r\nboy's sake, I mustn't! I can't!\"\r\n\r\nWith a tremendous effort, now crawling rather than walking--for her\r\nknees were as water--the girl dragged herself up the path almost to\r\nher doorway.\r\n\r\nAgain she heard the call, this time no hallucination, but reality.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! _Beatrice!_\" the voice was shouting. \"O-he! Beatrice!\"\r\n\r\nHis hail! Allan's!\r\n\r\nHer heart stopped, a long minute, and then, leaping with joy, a very\r\nanguish of revulsion from long pain, thrashed terribly in her breast.\r\n\r\nGasping with emotion, burned with the first sudden onset of a\r\nconsuming fever, half-blind, shivering, parched and in agony, the girl\r\nmade a tremendous effort to hear, to see, to understand.\r\n\r\n\"Allan! Allan!\" she shouted wildly. \"Where are you? _Where?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! Here! On the bridge! _I'm coming!_\"\r\n\r\nShe turned her dimming eyes toward the suspension bridge hung high\r\nabove the swift and lashing rapids of New Hope River--the bridge, a\r\ncobweb-strand in space, across the chasm.\r\n\r\nThere it seemed to her, though now she could be sure of nothing, so\r\nstrangely did the earth and sky and cliffs, the bridge, the jungle,\r\nall dance and interplay--there, it seemed, she saw a moving figure.\r\n\r\nDisheveled, torn, almost naked, lame and slow, yet with something\r\nstill of power and command in its bearing, this figure was advancing\r\nover the swaying path of bamboo-rods lashed to the cables of twisted\r\nfiber.\r\n\r\nNow it halted as in exhaustion and great pain; now, once more, it\r\nstruggled forward, limping, foot by foot; crawling, hanging fast to\r\nthe ropes like some great insect meshed in the wind-swung filaments.\r\n\r\nShe saw it, and she knew the truth at last.\r\n\r\n\"Allan! Allan--come quick! _Help me--help!_\"\r\n\r\nThen she collapsed. At her door she fell. All things blent and\r\nswirled, faded, darkened.\r\n\r\nShe knew no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE BOY IS GONE!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man, weak, wounded, racked with exhaustion from the\r\nterrible ordeal of the past days, felt fresh vigor leap through his\r\nspent veins at sight of her distress, afar.\r\n\r\nHe broke into a strange, limping run across the slight and shaking\r\nbridge; and as he ran he called to her, words of cheer and greeting,\r\nwords of encouragement and love.\r\n\r\nBut when, having penetrated the palisaded area and stumbled down the\r\nterraces, he reached her side, he stopped short, shaking, speechless,\r\nwith wide and terror-stricken eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Beatrice! Beta! My God, what's--_what's happened here?_\" he\r\nstammered, kneeling beside her, raising her in his weakened arms,\r\ncovering her pallid face with kisses, chafing her throat, her temples,\r\nher hands.\r\n\r\nThe girl gave no sign of returning consciousness. Allan stared about\r\nhim, sensing a great and devastating change since his departure, but\r\nas yet unable to comprehend its nature.\r\n\r\nGiddy himself with loss of blood and terrible fatigues, he hardly more\r\nthan half saw what lay before him; yet he knew catastrophe had\r\nbefallen Settlement Cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe river now foamed through strange new obstructions. A whole section\r\nof the cliff was gone. No sign of life at all was to be seen anywhere\r\ndown the terraces or paths.\r\n\r\nNone of the Folk, their blinking eyes shielded by their mica glasses\r\nfrom the morning sun, were drying fish or fruit at the frames.\r\n\r\nThe nets hung brown, and stiff, and dry; they should, at this hour,\r\nhave been limp and wet, from the night's fishing. The life of the\r\ncolony, he knew, had suddenly and for some incomprehensible reason\r\nstopped, as a watch stops when the spring is broken.\r\n\r\nAnd, worse than all, here Beatrice now lay in his arms, stricken by\r\nsome strange malady. He could not know the cause--the sleepless\r\nnights, the terrible toil, the shattering nervous strain of\r\ncatastrophe, of nursing, of the swift rebellion.\r\n\r\nBut he saw plainly now, the girl was burning with fever. And, raising\r\nhis face to heaven, he uttered a cry, half a groan, half a sob--the\r\ncry of a soul racked too long upon the torture-wheel of fate.\r\n\r\n\"But--but where's the boy?\" he asked himself, striving to recover his\r\nself-control; trying to understand, to act, to save. \"What's happened\r\nhere? God knows! An earthquake? Disaster, at any rate! Beatrice! Oh,\r\nmy Beta! Speak to me!\"\r\n\r\nUnable to solve any of the terrible problems now beating in upon him,\r\nhe raised her still higher in his arms.\r\n\r\nLoudly he shouted for help down the terrace, calling on his Folk to\r\nshow themselves; to come to him and to obey.\r\n\r\nBut though the shattered cliff rang with his commands, no one\r\nappeared. In all seeming as deserted and as void of human life as on\r\nthe first day he and Beta had set foot there, the canyon brooded under\r\nthe morning sun, and for all answer rose only the foaming tumult of\r\nthe rapids far below.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Heavens, I've got to do _something!_\" cried Allan,\r\nforgetting his own lacerations and his pain, in this supreme crisis.\r\n\"She--she's sick! She's got a fever! I've got to put her to bed\r\nanyhow! After that we'll see!\"\r\n\r\nWith a strength he knew not lay now in his wasted arms, he lifted her\r\nbodily and carried her to the door of Cliff Villa, their home among\r\nthe massive buttresses of rock.\r\n\r\nBut, to his vast astonishment and terror, he found the door refused to\r\nopen. It was fast barred inside.\r\n\r\nEven from his own house he found himself shut out, an exile and a\r\nstranger!\r\n\r\nLoudly he shouted for admission, savagely beat upon the planks, all to\r\nno purpose. There came no sound from within, no answering word or\r\nsign.\r\n\r\nEagerly listening for perhaps the cry of his child, he heard nothing.\r\nA tomblike silence brooded there, as in all the stricken colony.\r\n\r\nThen Allan, fired with a burning fury, laid the girl down again, and\r\nseizing a great boulder from the top of the parapet that guarded the\r\nterraced walk, dashed it against the door. The planks groaned and\r\nquivered, but held.\r\n\r\nRecoiling, exhausted by even this single effort, the disheveled,\r\nwounded man stared with haggard eyes at the barrier.\r\n\r\nThe very strength he had put into that door to guard his treasures,\r\nhis wife and his son, now defied him. And a curse, bitter as death,\r\nburst from his trembling lips.\r\n\r\nBut now he heard a sound, a word, a phrase or two of incoherent\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nWhirling, he saw the girl's mouth move. In her delirium she was\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nHe knelt again beside her, cradled her in his arms, kissed and\r\ncherished her--and he heard broken, disjointed words--words that\r\nfilled him with passionate rage and overpowering woe.\r\n\r\n\"So many dead--so many!--And so many dying.--_You_, H'yemba! You\r\nbeast! Let me go!--Oh, when the master comes!\"\r\n\r\nAllan understood at last. His mind, now clear, despite the maddening\r\ntorments of the past week, grasped the situation in a kind of\r\nsupersensitive clairvoyance.\r\n\r\nAs by a lightning-flash on a dark night, so now the blackness of his\r\nwonder, of this mystery, all stood instantly illumined. He understood.\r\n\r\n\"What incredible fiendishness!\" he exclaimed, quite slowly, as though\r\nunable to imagine it in human bounds. \"At a time of disaster and of\r\ndeath, such as has smitten the colony--what hellish villainy!\"\r\n\r\nHe said no more, but in his eyes burned the fire that meant death,\r\ninstant and without reprieve.\r\n\r\nFirst he looked to his automatic; but, alas, not one cartridge\r\nremained either in its magazine or in the pouches of his belt. The\r\nfouled and blackened barrel told something of the terrible story of\r\nthe past few days.\r\n\r\n\"Gone, all gone,\" he muttered; but, with sudden inspiration, bent over\r\nthe girl.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Ammunition again!\"\r\n\r\nQuickly he reloaded from her belts. One belt he buckled round his\r\nwaist. Then, pistol in hand, he thought swiftly.\r\n\r\nThus his mind ran: \"The first thing to do is look out for Beatrice,\r\nand make her comfortable--find out what the matter is with her, and\r\ngive treatment. I need fresh water, but I daren't go down to the river\r\nfor it and leave her here. At any minute H'yemba may appear. And when\r\nhe does, I must see him first.\r\n\r\n\"Evidently the thing most necessary is to gain access to our home. How\r\ncan it be locked, inside, when Beatrice is here? Heaven only knows!\r\nThere may be enemies in there at this minute. H'yemba may be there--\"\r\n\r\nAnguish pierced his soul at thought of his son now possibly in the\r\nsmith's power.\r\n\r\n\"By God!\" he cried, \"something has got to be done, and quick!\"\r\n\r\nHis rage was growing by leaps and bounds.\r\n\r\nHe advanced to the door, and putting the muzzle of his automatic\r\nalmost on the lock, shattered it with six heavy bullets.\r\n\r\nAgain he dashed the boulder against the door. It groaned and gave.\r\n\r\nReloading ere he ventured in, he now set his shoulder to the door and\r\nforced it slowly open, with the pistol always ready in his right hand.\r\n\r\nKeenly his eyes sought out the darkened corners of the room. Here,\r\nthere they pierced, striving to determine whether any ambushed foe\r\nwere lying there in wait for him.\r\n\r\n\"Surrender!\" he cried loudly in the Merucaan tongue. \"If there be any\r\nhere who war with me, surrender! _At the first sign of fight, you\r\ndie!_\"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nStill leaving the girl beside the broken door till he should feel\r\npositive there was no peril--and always filled with a vast wonder how\r\nthe door could have been locked from within--Allan advanced slowly,\r\ncautiously, into their home.\r\n\r\nHe was cool now--cool and strong again. The frightful perils and\r\nexposures of the week past seemed to have fallen from him like an\r\noutworn mantle.\r\n\r\nHe ignored his pain and weakness as though such things were not. And,\r\nwith index on trigger, eyes watchful and keen, he scouted down the\r\ncave-dwelling.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Who's there?\" he challenged loudly.\r\n\r\nAt the left of the room, not far from the big fireplace, he had\r\nperceived a dim, vague figure, prone upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\"_Answer, or I shoot!_\"\r\n\r\nBut the figure remained motionless. Allan realized there was no fight\r\nin it. Still cautiously, however, he advanced.\r\n\r\nNow he touched the figure with his foot, now bent above it and peered\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\"Old Gesafam! Heaven above! Wounded! What does this mean?\"\r\n\r\nStarting back, he stared in horror at the old woman, stunned and\r\nmotionless, with the blood coagulating along an ugly cut on her\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nThen, as though a prescience had swept his being, he sprang to the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n\"My son! My boy! Where are you?\" he shouted hoarsely.\r\n\r\nWith a shaking hand he flung down the bedclothes of finely woven palm\r\nfiber.\r\n\r\n\"My boy! My boy!\"\r\n\r\nThe bed was empty. His son had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF H'YEMBA\r\n\r\n\r\nBlinded with staggering grief and terror, stunned, stricken,\r\nall but annihilated, the man recoiled.\r\n\r\nThen, with a cry, he sprang to the bed again, and now in a very\r\npassion of eagerness explored it. His trembling hands dragged all the\r\nbedding off and threw it broadcast. By the dim light he peered with\r\nwide and terror-smitten eyes.\r\n\r\n\"My boy!\" he choked. \"_My boy!_\"\r\n\r\nBut beyond all manner of doubt the boy had been stolen.\r\n\r\nUnable to understand, or think, or plan, Allan stood there, his face\r\nghastly, his heart quivering within him.\r\n\r\nWhat could have happened? How and why? If the door had been securely\r\nlocked and the old nurse been with the child, how could the kidnapper\r\nhave borne him away?\r\n\r\nWhat? How? Why?\r\n\r\nMore, ever more, questions crowded the man's brain, all equally\r\nwithout answer.\r\n\r\nBut now, he dimly realized, was no time for solving problems. The\r\nminute demanded swift and drastic action. He must find, must save, his\r\nson! After that other riddles could he unraveled.\r\n\r\n\"H'yemba!\" he cried hoarsely. \"This is H'yemba's work! Revenge and\r\nhate have driven him to rebel again. To try to seize Beatrice! To\r\nsteal my son! At this time of peril and affliction, above all others!\r\nH'yemba! The smith must die!\"\r\n\r\nBut first he realized he must get Beatrice into safety.\r\n\r\nIn haste he ran to the door, picked up the girl and carried her to the\r\nbed. Here he disposed her at ease, covered her with the bedding, and\r\nbathed her face and hands with water from the cooling-jar.\r\n\r\nThe old nurse he laid upon the broad couch by the fire and likewise\r\ntended. He saw now she had been struck with a stone ax, a glancing\r\nblow, severe, but not necessarily fatal.\r\n\r\n\"Probably trying to defend the boy!\" thought he. \"Brave heart!\r\nFaithful even unto death--if death be your reward!\"\r\n\r\nLeaving her, he returned to his wife.\r\n\r\nNow, he well understood, he had no time for emotion. There must be no\r\nfalse move. Even at the expense of a little time, he must plan the\r\ncampaign with skill and execute it with relentless energy.\r\n\r\nHe alone now stood for power, rule, order, law, in this disintegrated\r\ncommunity--this colony racked with disaster, anarchy and death.\r\n\r\nUpon him alone now depended its whole fate and future, and, with it,\r\nthe fate and future of the world.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Lord, what a situation!\" he whispered. \"At home, disruption\r\nand savagery. Outside, the Horde--the Horde now pressing onward after\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down beside the bed and forced himself to think. Weak as he was\r\nand wounded with a spear-thrust in the lower leg as well as a jagged\r\ncut across the breast, he felt that he might still keep strength\r\nenough for a few hours more of toil.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden he realized an over-powering thirst. Till now he had not\r\nfelt it. He arose, drank deeply from the jar, then--something cooler\r\nand more calm--once more returned to Beatrice.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing is to help her,\" he said. \"No use in losing my wits\r\nand rushing out unprepared to find the boy. If H'yemba has stolen him\r\nit's certain the boy is hidden beyond my present power in some far\r\nrecess of the inter-communicating rabbit-warren of caves below there\r\nin the cliff.\r\n\r\n\"I feel positive no bodily harm will be done the child. H'yemba will\r\nhold him for power over me. He will try to exact terms--even to\r\nleadership in the colony, even to possession of Beatrice. And the\r\npenalty of refusal may be the boy's death--\"\r\n\r\nHe shuddered profoundly, and with both wasted hands covered his face.\r\nFor a moment madness sought to possess him.\r\n\r\nHe felt a wild desire to shout imprecations, to rush out, fling\r\nhimself against the cave-door of H'yemba and riddle it with\r\nbullets--but presently calm returned again. For in Stern's nature lay\r\nnothing of hysteria. Reason and calm judgment dominated. And before he\r\nacted he always reckoned every pro and con.\r\n\r\n\"It must be a battle of wits as well as force,\" thought he. \"A little\r\ntime will decide all that. For now Beatrice demands my first care and\r\nthought!\"\r\n\r\nNow he examined the girl once more. Closing the door and lighting the\r\nbronze lamp, he carefully studied the sick woman, noting her symptoms,\r\npulse and respiration.\r\n\r\n\"What to do?\" he asked himself. \"What means to tale?\"\r\n\r\nHe arose and rummaged the stores for drugs. Above all, he must break\r\nthe fever. He therefore prepared and administered a powerful\r\nfebrifuge, covered the girl with all the available bedding, and\r\ndetermined, if possible, to make her sweat. This done, he found no\r\nfurther means at hand and now turned his attention once more to\r\nGesafam.\r\n\r\nHer wound he bathed and bandaged and, having given her a stiff drink\r\nof brandy, poured between resisting teeth which he had to separate\r\nwith his knife-blade, he presently perceived some signs of returning\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nBut, though he questioned the old woman and tried desperately to make\r\nher answer, he could get no coherent information.\r\n\r\nOnly the name of H'yemba and some few disconnected mutterings of\r\nterror rewarded him. He knew now, however, with positive certainty\r\nthat the smith was responsible for the kidnapping of his son.\r\n\r\n\"And that,\" said he, \"means I must seek him out at once. All I ask is\r\njust one sight of him. One sight, one bullet--and the score is paid!\"\r\n\r\nHe arose and, again making sure his automatic was in complete\r\nreadiness, stood for a second in thought. Whatever he was now to do\r\nmust be done quickly.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours, at the outside, he knew the vanguard of the pursuing\r\nHorde would enter the last valley on the other side of the canyon. By\r\nafternoon another battle might be on.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever happens, I must get my grip on the colony again at once!\" he\r\nrealized. \"Such of the Folk as are still sound must be rallied.\r\nOtherwise nothing but annihilation awaits us all!\"\r\n\r\nBut, even as he faced the exit of Cliff Villa, all at once the door\r\nwas hurled violently open and a harsh, discordant cry of hatred and\r\ndefiance burst into the cave.\r\n\r\nStern saw the detested figure of H'yemba standing there, loose-hung,\r\npowerful, barbaric, his eyes blinking evilly behind the mica screens\r\nthat Allan himself had made for him.\r\n\r\nWith a cry Allan started forward.\r\n\r\n\"My son!\" he gasped.\r\n\r\nThere, clutched in the smith's left arm, lay the boy!\r\n\r\nAllan heard his child crying as in pain, and rage swept every caution\r\nto the winds.\r\n\r\nHe sprang toward H'yemba, cursing; but the smith, with a beast-laugh,\r\nraised his right hand.\r\n\r\n\"Master!\" he mocked. \"No nearer or ye die!\"\r\n\r\nAllan, aghast, saw the flicker of sunlight on a pistol-barrel. With\r\nonly too true an aim, H'yemba had him covered.\r\n\r\nCame a little pause, tense as steel wire. Somewhere down the terrace\r\nsounded a murmur of voices. Allan seemed to sense that the rebel had\r\nnow gathered his forces and that a general attack was imminent.\r\n\r\nTime! At all hazards he must gain a moment's time!\r\n\r\n\"H'yemba!\" cried he. \"What is your speech with me, your master?\"\r\n\r\n\"Master?\" sneered the smith again. \"My slave! Power has passed from\r\nyou to me. From you, who speak the false, who entrap us here to suffer\r\nand die, who slay and ruin us, to me, who will yet lead the people\r\nback to their far home, to safety and to life!\"\r\n\r\n\"You lie, hound!\"\r\n\r\nThe smith laughed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"That shall be seen--who lies!\" he gibed. \"But now power is mine. I\r\nhave your son in my hand. Move only and I fling him from the cliff!\"\r\n\r\nAllan felt his brain whirl; all things seemed to turn about him. But\r\nhe fought off his faintness, and in a shaken voice once more demanded:\r\n\r\n\"What terms, H'yemba?\"\r\n\r\n\"Slavery for you and yours! Your son shall be my serf; your woman my\r\nchattel! Ha, that woman! She has already fought me, like one of these\r\nstrange woods-beasts you have made us kill! See! My hair is burned and\r\nmy flesh blistered with her fire-beating! But when I hold her in these\r\nhands then she shall pay for all, the vuedma!\"\r\n\r\nStern's hand twitched, with the automatic gripped in the fingers, but\r\nthe blacksmith cried a warning.\r\n\r\n\"Raise not that hand, slave!\" he ordered. \"You cannot shoot without\r\nthe danger of killing this vile spawn of yours! And remember, too, the\r\nriver lies far below, and very sharp are the waiting rocks!\r\n\r\n\"Fool that you are, that think yourself so wise! To leave this place\r\nwith me! With me, skilled in all labors of metal and stone, strong to\r\ncut passage-ways--\"\r\n\r\n\"You devil! You hewed a way into my house?\"\r\n\r\nH'yemba laughed brutally.\r\n\r\n\"Silently, steadily, I labored!\" he boasted. \"And behold the reward!\r\nPower for me; eternal slavery for you and all your blood--if any\r\nlive!\"\r\n\r\nInsane with rage and hate, Allan nevertheless realized that now all\r\ndepended on keeping his thought and nerve.\r\n\r\nOne single premature move and his son would inevitably be hurled over\r\nthe parapet, down two hundred and fifty feet to the river-bed below.\r\nAt all hazards, he must keep cool!\r\n\r\nThe smith, after all only a barbarian and of limited intelligence, had\r\nnot even thought of the obvious command to make Stern drop his pistol\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\nUpon this oversight now hung all Allan's hopes.\r\n\r\nEven though the man's retainers might rush the cave and slaughter all,\r\nyet in Allan's heart burned a clear and steady flame of hot desire to\r\ncompass H'yemba's death.\r\n\r\nAnd as the smith now loudly boasted, insulted, vilified, in the true\r\nmanner of the savage, imperceptibly, inch by inch, Allan was turning\r\nhis pistol-barrel upward.\r\n\r\nHigher, higher, bit by bit it crept toward the horizontal.\r\nUnaccustomed to shoot from the hip, Allan realized that right before\r\nhim lay a supreme test of nerve and marksmanship and skill.\r\n\r\nTo shoot and kill his boy--the thought was too hideous even to be\r\nconsidered. His father-heart yearned toward the frightened, crying\r\nchild there in the traitor's grip.\r\n\r\nThe unconscious form of Beatrice fever-burned and panting on the bed,\r\nseemed calling aloud to him: \"Aim true, Allan! _Aim true!_\"\r\n\r\nFor one false shot inevitably sealed the child's death. To wound\r\nH'yemba and not kill him meant the catastrophe. If the bullet failed\r\nto enter brain or heart, H'yemba--though mortally hurt--would of a\r\nsurety, with his last quiver of strength, sling the boy outward over\r\nthe dizzying parapet.\r\n\r\nAllan prayed; yet his prayer was wordless, formless and unconscious.\r\n\r\nHe dared not glance down at the automatic. His eyes must hold the\r\nsmith's. And he must speak, must parley, at all hazards must still\r\ngain another moment's respite.\r\n\r\nWhat Allan said in those last terrible, eternal seconds he could never\r\nafterward recall.\r\n\r\nHe only knew he was treating with the enemy, making terms, listening,\r\nanswering--all with mechanical sub-consciousness.\r\n\r\nHis real personality, his true ego, was absolutely absorbed in the one\r\nvital, all-deciding problem of that stiffening pistol-hand.\r\n\r\nSuddenly something seemed to cry in his ear:\r\n\r\n\"You have it now! Fire!\"\r\n\r\nHis hand leaped back with the crashing discharge, loud-echoing in the\r\ncave.\r\n\r\nH'yemba did not even yell. But at the second when he seemed to crumple\r\nall together, falling as an empty sack falls, some involuntary jerk of\r\nhis finger sent a bullet zooming into the cave.\r\n\r\nIt shattered beyond Allan in a little shower of steel and lead\r\nfragments, mingled with rock-dust.\r\n\r\nBefore these had even fallen Allan was upon him.\r\n\r\nNeglecting for an instant the bruised and screaming child, who lay\r\nthere struggling on the terrace-path, Allan seized the still-twitching\r\nbody of the monstrous traitor.\r\n\r\nWith passionate strength he dragged it to the parapet.\r\n\r\nBelow, down the path, he caught a swift glimpse of grouped Folk,\r\nwondering, staring, aghast.\r\n\r\nTo them he gave no heed.\r\n\r\nHe lifted the body, dripping bright blood.\r\n\r\nSilent, indomitable, disheveled, he raised it on high.\r\n\r\nThen, with a cry: \"See, ye people, how I answer traitors!\" he\r\nwhirled it outward into the void.\r\n\r\nOver and over it gyrated through vacant space. Then, with an echoing\r\nsplash, the river took it, and the swift current, white-foaming,\r\nboisterous, wild, rolled it and tumbled it away, away forever, into\r\nthe unknown.\r\n\r\nWith harsh cries and a wild spatter of bullets aimed high above them,\r\nAllan drove the cowed and beaten partizans of H'yemba jostling,\r\nfleeing, howling for mercy, down the terrace-path between the cliff\r\nand parapet.\r\n\r\nOnly then, when he knew victory was secure and his own dominance once\r\nmore sealed on them, did he run swiftly back to his boy.\r\n\r\nSnatching up the child, he retreated into the home cave again; and now\r\nfor the first time he realized his wan and sunken cheeks were wet with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF THE HORDE\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that, for an hour or two at least, he felt himself free and\r\nmaster of the situation, Allan devoted himself with energy to the\r\nimmediate situation in Cliff Villa.\r\n\r\nThough still weak and dazed, old Gesafam had now recovered strength\r\nand wit enough to soothe and care for the child.\r\n\r\nAllan heard from her, in a few disjointed words, all she knew of the\r\nkidnapping. H'yemba, she said, had suddenly appeared to her, from the\r\nremote end of the cave, and had tried to snatch the child.\r\n\r\nShe had fought, but one blow of his ax had stunned her. Beyond this,\r\nshe remembered nothing.\r\n\r\nAllan sought and quickly found the aperture made by the smith through\r\nthe limestone.\r\n\r\n\"Evidently he'd been planning this coup for a long time,\" thought he.\r\n\"The great catastrophe of the land-slide broke the last bonds of order\r\nand restraint, and gave him his opportunity. Well, it's his last\r\nvillainy! I'll have this passageway cemented up. That's all the\r\nmonument he'll ever get. It's more than he deserves!\"\r\n\r\nHe returned to Beatrice. The girl still lay there, moaning a little in\r\nher fevered sleep. Allan watched her in anguish.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if she should die--if she should die!\" thought he, and felt the\r\nsweat start on his forehead. \"She must not! She can't! I won't let\r\nher!\"\r\n\r\nA touch on his arm aroused him from his vigil. Turning, he saw\r\nGesafam.\r\n\r\n\"The child, O Kromno, hungers. It is crying for food!\" Allan thought.\r\nHe saw at once the impossibility of letting the boy come near its\r\nmother. Some other arrangement must be made.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" thought he. \"I have it!\"\r\n\r\nHe gestured toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"Go,\" he commanded. \"Go up the path, to the palisaded place. Take this\r\nrope. Bring back, with you a she-goat. Thus shall the child be fed!\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman obeyed. In a quarter-hour she had returned, dragging a\r\nwild goat that bleated in terror.\r\n\r\nThen, while she watched with amazement, Allan succeeded in milking the\r\ncreature; though he had to lash securely all four feet and throw it to\r\nthe cave-floor before it would submit.\r\n\r\nHe modified the milk with water and bade the old woman administer it\r\nby means of a bit of soft cloth. Allan, Junior, protested with yells,\r\nbut had to make the best of hard necessity; and, after a long and\r\npainful process, was surfeited and dozed off. Gesafam put him to bed\r\non the divan by the fire.\r\n\r\n\"A poor substitute,\" thought Allan, \"but it will sustain life. He's\r\nhealthy; he can stand it--he's _got_ to. Thank God for that goat!\r\nWithout it he might easily have starved.\"\r\n\r\nHe tied the animal at the rear of the cave, and had Gesafam fetch a\r\ngood supply of grass. Thus for the present one problem at least was\r\nsolved.\r\n\r\nBeatrice's condition remained unchanged. Now and then she called for\r\nwater, which he gave her plentifully. Once he thought she recognized\r\nhim, but he could not be certain.\r\n\r\nAnd day wore on; and now the hour of noon was at hand. Allan knew that\r\nother duties called him. He must go down among the Folk and save them,\r\ntoo, if possible.\r\n\r\nEating a little at random and making sure as always that his pistols\r\nwere well loaded, he consigned Beatrice and the child into the old\r\nwoman's keeping and left the cave.\r\n\r\nOn the terrace he stopped a moment, gazing triumphantly at the\r\nbloodmarks now thickly coagulated down the rocks.\r\n\r\nThen, out over the canyon and the forest to northward he peered. His\r\neyes caught the signal-fires he knew must be there now, not ten miles\r\naway; and with a nod he smiled.\r\n\r\n\"They've certainly trailed me close, the devils!\" sneered he. \"Since\r\nthe minute they first attacked my two men and me, trying to repair the\r\ndisabled Pauillac in that infernal valley so far to northward, they\r\nhaven't given me an hour's respite! Before night there'll be war!\r\nWell, let them come. The quicker now the better!\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned, and with a determined step, still clad in his\r\ngrotesque rags, descended toward the caves of the Folk, such as still\r\nwere left.\r\n\r\nWhere all had been resistance and defiant surliness before, now all\r\nhad become obedience and worship. He understood enough of the\r\nbarbarian psychology to know that power, strength and dominance--and\r\nthese alone--commanded respect with the Folk.\r\n\r\nAnd among them all, those who had not seen as well as those that had,\r\nthe sudden, dramatic, annihilating downfall of H'yemba had again\r\ncemented the bonds of solidarity more closely than ever.\r\n\r\nThe sight of that arch-rebel's body hurled from the parapet had\r\neffectually tamed them, every one. No longer was there any murmur in\r\ntheir caves, no thought save of obedience and worship.\r\n\r\n\"It's not what I want,\" reflected Allan. \"I want intelligent\r\ncooperation, not adulation. I want democracy! But, damn it! if they\r\ncan't understand, then I must rule a while. And rule I will--and they\r\nshall obey or die!\"\r\n\r\nQuickly he got in touch with the situation. From cave to cave he went,\r\nestimating the damage. At the great gap in the terrace he stood and\r\ncarefully observed the wreckage in the river-bed below.\r\n\r\nHe visited the hospital-cave, administered medicines, changed\r\ndressings and labored for his Folk as though no shadow of rebellion\r\never had come 'twixt them and him. The news of Bremilu's death moved\r\nhim profoundly. Bremilu had been one of his two most competent and\r\ntrusted followers, and Allan, too, felt a strong personal affection\r\nfor the man who had saved his life that first night at the cliffs.\r\n\r\nBeside the body he stood, in the morgue-cave whither it had been\r\nborne. With bowed head the master looked upon the man; and from his\r\neyes fell tears; and in his heart he felt a vacant place not soon to\r\nbe made whole.\r\n\r\nWith profound emotion he took Bremilu's cold hand in his--the hand\r\nthat had so deftly and so powerfully stricken down the gorilla--and\r\nfor a while held it, gazing on the dead man's face.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by,\" said he at length. \"You were a brave heart and a true.\r\nNever shall you be forgotten. Good-by!\"\r\n\r\nHe summoned a huge fellow named Frumuos, now the most intelligent of\r\nthe Folk remaining, and together they directed the work of carrying\r\nthe bodies up to the cliff-top and there burying them.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the afternoon some semblance of order and control had\r\nbecome organized in the colony. He returned to Cliff Villa, leaving\r\nstrict orders for Frumuos to call him in case of need.\r\n\r\nVery beautiful the world was that afternoon. In the soft south wind\r\nthe fronded palms across the river were bowing and nodding gracefully.\r\nOverhead, dazzling clouds drifted northward.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him he could almost hear the rustle of the dry\r\nundergrowth, parched by the past fortnight of exceptionally hot\r\nweather; but, above all, rose the eternal babble of the rapids. High\r\nin air, a vulture wheeled its untiring spirals. At sight of it he\r\nfrowned. It reminded him of the Pauillac, now wrecked far beyond the\r\nhorizon, where the Horde had trapped him. He shuddered, for the\r\nmemories of the past week were infinitely horrible, and he longed only\r\nto forget.\r\n\r\nWith a last glance at the scene, over which the ominous threads of\r\nsmoke now drifted in considerable numbers, he frowned. He reentered\r\nthe villa.\r\n\r\n\"No matter _what_ happens now,\" he muttered, \"I've got to snatch a few\r\nminutes rest. Otherwise, I'm liable to drop in my tracks. And, above\r\nall, I must try to pull through. For on me, and me alone, now\r\neverything depends!\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down by the bed again, too stupefied by the toxins of fatigue\r\nand exhaustion to do more than note that Beatrice was, at any rate, no\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nHuman effort and emotion had, in fact, reached their extreme climax in\r\nhim. He felt numb all over, in body, mind and soul. A weaker man would\r\nhave succumbed long ago to but half the hardships he had struggled\r\nthrough. Now he must rest a bit.\r\n\r\n\"Bring water, Gesafam!\" he commanded. When she had obeyed, he let her\r\nwash his wounds and dress them with leaves and ointment. Then he\r\nhimself bandaged them, his head nodding, eyes already drooping shut\r\nfrom moment to moment.\r\n\r\nHis head sank on the bed, and one hand sought the girl's. Despite his\r\nwonderful vitality and strength, Allan was on the verge of collapse.\r\n\r\nVague and confused thoughts wandered through his unsettled brain.\r\n\r\nWhat was the destiny of the colony to be, now that the Pauillac was\r\nlost and so many of the Folk wiped out? Were there any hopes of\r\nultimate success? And the Horde, what of that? How long a respite\r\nmight be counted on before the inevitable, decisive battle?\r\n\r\nA score, a hundred questions, more and more illusory, blent and faded\r\nand reformed in his overtaxed mind.\r\n\r\nThen, blessed as a balm, sleep took him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA violent shaking roused him from dead slumber.\r\nOld Gesafam stood there beside him. She had him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Waken, O master!\" she was crying. \"O Kromno, rouse! For now there is\r\ngreat need!\"\r\n\r\nDazed, he started up.\r\n\r\n\"What--what is it now? More trouble?\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"Beyond there, master! Beyond the river there be many moving\r\ncreatures! Darts and arrows have begun to fall against the cliff. See,\r\none has even come into the cave! What shall be done, master?\"\r\n\r\nBroad awake now, Allan ran to the door and peered out.\r\n\r\nDaylight was fading. He must have slept an hour or two; it had seemed\r\nbut a second. In the west the sun was burning its way toward the\r\nhorizon, through a thick set of haze that cloaked the rim of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\"Here, master! See!\"\r\n\r\nStooping, she picked up a long, slight object and handed it to him.\r\n\r\n\"One of their poisoned darts, so help me!\" he exclaimed. \"Cast that\r\ninto the fire, Gesafam. And have a care lest it wound you, for the\r\nslightest scratch is death!\"\r\n\r\nWhile she, wondering, obeyed, he hastily reconnoitered the situation.\r\n\r\nHe had felt positive the Horde, after his escape from it by devious\r\nand terrible ways, would track him down.\r\n\r\nHe had known the army of the hideous little beast-folk, that for a\r\nyear now had been slowly gathering from north and east for one final\r\nassault, would eventually find Settlement Cliffs and there make still\r\nanother attempt to crush him and his.\r\n\r\nBut, knowing all this, knowing even that the whole region beyond the\r\nriver now swarmed with these ghastly monstrosities, the actuality\r\nappalled him.\r\n\r\nNow that the attack was really at hand, he felt a strange and sudden\r\nsense of helplessness.\r\n\r\nAnd with a bitter curse he shook his fist at the dark forest across\r\nthe canyon where--even as he looked--he saw a movement of crouching,\r\nfurtive things; he heard a dull thump-thump as of clubs beating hollow\r\nlogs.\r\n\r\n\"You devils!\" he execrated. \"Oh, for a ton of Pulverite to drop among\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"Look, master, look! The bridge! The bridge!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned quickly as old Gesafam pointed up-stream.\r\n\r\nThere, clearly outlined against the sky, he saw a dozen--a score of\r\nlittle, crouching figures emerge from the forest on the north bank,\r\nand at a clumsy run defile along the swaying footpath high above the\r\nrapids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nWAR!\r\n\r\n\r\nAt sight of the advance-guard of the Horde now already loping,\r\ncrouched and ugly, over the narrow bridge to Settlement Cliffs Allan's\r\nfirst impulse was one of absolute despair.\r\n\r\nHe had expected an attack ere night, but at least he had hoped an\r\nhour's respite to recover a little of his strength and to muster all\r\nthe still valid men of the Folk for resistance. Now, however, he saw\r\neven this was to be denied him. For already the leaders of the Horde\r\nscouts had passed the center of the bridge.\r\n\r\nThree or four minutes more and they would be inside the palisade, upon\r\nthe cliff!\r\n\r\n\"God! If they once get in there, we're gone!\" cried Allan. \"We're cut\r\noff from everything. Our animals will be slaughtered. The boy will\r\ndie! They can bombard us with rocks from aloft. It means\r\nannihilation!\"\r\n\r\nAlready he was running up the path toward the palisade. Not one second\r\nwas to be lost. There was no time even to call a single man of the\r\nFolk to reenforce him. Single-handed and alone he must meet the\r\ninvaders' first attack.\r\n\r\nPanting, sweating, stumbling, he scrambled up the steep terrace. And\r\nas he ran his thoughts outdistanced him.\r\n\r\n\"Fool that I was to have left the bridge!\" choked he. \"My first act\r\nwhen I set foot on solid land should have been to cut the ropes and\r\ndrop the whole thing into the rapids! I might have known this would\r\nhappen--fool that I was!\"\r\n\r\nThe safety, the life, of the whole colony, including his wife and son,\r\nnow depended solely on his reaching the southern end of the bridge\r\nbefore the vanguard of the Horde.\r\n\r\nWith a heart-racking burst of energy he sprang to the defence, and as\r\nhe ran he drew his hunting-knife.\r\n\r\nReeling with exhaustion, spent, winded, yet still in desperation\r\nstruggling onward, he won the top of the cliff, swung to the left\r\nalong the path that led to the bridge, and--more dead than\r\nalive--rushed onward in a last, supreme effort.\r\n\r\nAlready he saw the Anthropoids were within a hundred feet of the\r\nabutment. He could plainly see their squat, hideous bodies, their\r\nhairy and pendent arms, and the ugly shuffle of their preposterous\r\nlegs, as at their best speed they made for the cliff.\r\n\r\nThree or four poisoned darts fell clicking on the stones about him.\r\nHowls and yells of rage burst from the file of beast-men.\r\n\r\nOne of the horrible creatures even--with apelike agility--sprang up\r\ninto the guy ropes of the bridge, clung there, and discharged an arrow\r\nfrom its bamboo blow-gun, chattering with rage.\r\n\r\nStern, running but the faster, plugged him with a forty-four. The\r\nAnthropoid, still clinging, yowled hideously, then all at once dropped\r\noff and vanished in the depths.\r\n\r\nFull drive, Allan hurled himself toward the entrance of the bridge. It\r\nseemed to him the beasts were almost on him now.\r\n\r\nPlainly he could hear the slavering click of their tushes and see the\r\nred, bleared winking of their deep-set eyes.\r\n\r\nNow he was at the rope-anchorage, where the cables were lashed to two\r\nstout palms.\r\n\r\nHe emptied his automatic point-blank into the pack.\r\n\r\nPausing not to note effects, he slashed furiously at the left-hand\r\nrope.\r\n\r\nOne strand gave. It sprang apart and began untwisting. Again he hewed\r\nwith mad rage.\r\n\r\n\"_Crack!_\"\r\n\r\nThe cable parted with a report like a pistol-shot. From the bridge a\r\nwild, hideous tumult of yells and shrieks arose. The whole fabric, now\r\nunsupported on one side, dropped awry. Covered from end to end with\r\nAnthropoids, it swayed heavily.\r\n\r\nHad _men_ been on it, all must have been flung into the rapids by the\r\nshock. But these beast-things, used to arboreal work, to scaling\r\ncliffs, to every kind of dangerous adventuring, nearly all succeeded\r\nin clinging.\r\n\r\nOnly three or four were shaken off, to catapult over and over down\r\ninto the foaming lash of the river.\r\n\r\nAnd still, now creeping with hideous agility along the racked and\r\nswinging bridge that hung by but a single rope, they continued to make\r\nway, howling and screaming like damned souls.\r\n\r\nOne gained the shore! At Allan it bounded, crouching, ferocious,\r\ndeadly. He saw the tiny, venomous lance raised for the throw.\r\n\r\n\"_Flick!_\"\r\n\r\nHe felt a twitch on his arm. Was he wounded? He knew not. Only he knew\r\nthat with blind rage he had flung himself on the second rope, and now\r\nwith demon-rage was hacking at it desperately.\r\n\r\nThe snapping whirl of the cable as it parted flung him backward.\r\n\r\nHe had an instant's vision of the whole bridge-structure crumpling.\r\nThen it vanished. From the depths rose the most awful scream, quickly\r\nsmothered, that he had ever heard.\r\n\r\nAnd as the bestial bodies went tumbling, rolling, fighting, down the\r\nrapids, he suddenly beheld the bridge footway hanging limp and swaying\r\nagainst the further cliff.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God! In time, in time!\" he panted, staggering like a drunken\r\nman.\r\n\r\nBut all at once he beheld two of the Horde still there in front of\r\nhim--the one that had flung the dart and another. They were advancing\r\nat a lope.\r\n\r\nAllan turned and fled.\r\n\r\nHis ammunition was all spent, he knew that to face them was madness.\r\n\r\n\"I must load up again,\" thought he. \"Then I'll make short work of\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\nFortunately he could far outstrip them in flight. That, and that\r\nalone, had already saved him in the past week of horrible pursuit\r\nthrough the forests to northward. And quickly now he ran down the\r\nterrace again--down to the caves below. As he ran he shouted in\r\nMerucaan:\r\n\r\n\"Out, my people! Out with you! Out to battle! Out to war!\"\r\n\r\nHalf way upward down to Cliff Villa he met Frumuos toiling upward. Him\r\nhe greeted and quickly informed of the situation.\r\n\r\n\"The bridge is down!\" he panted. \"I cut it! The further shore is\r\nswarming with enemies. Two have reached this side!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is this, O Kromno?\" asked the man anxiously, pointing at Allan's\r\nshoulder. \"Have they wounded you?\"\r\n\r\nAllan looked and saw a poisoned dart hanging loosely in his left\r\nsleeve. As he moved he could feel the point rubbing against his naked\r\nskin.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Heaven!\" he exclaimed. \"Has it scratched me?\"\r\n\r\nWith infinite precautions he loosened and threw off his outer garment.\r\nHe flung it, with the dart still adhering, down over the cliff.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Frumuos!\" he commanded. \"Search carefully and see if there be\r\nany scratch on the skin!\"\r\n\r\nThe man obeyed, making a minute inspection through his mica\r\neye-shields. Then he shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No, Kromno,\" he answered. \"I see nothing. But the arrow came near,\r\nnear!\"\r\n\r\nStern, tremendously relieved, gestured toward the caves.\r\n\r\n\"Go swiftly!\" he commanded. \"Bring up every man who still can fight.\r\nAll must have full burdens of cartridges. Even though the bridge be\r\ndown, the enemy will still attack!\"\r\n\r\n\"But how, since the great river lies between?\"\r\n\r\n\"They can climb down those cliffs and swim the river and scramble up\r\nthis side as easily as we can walk on level ground. Go swiftly! There\r\nis no time to lose!\"\r\n\r\n\"I go, master. But tell me, the two who have already reached this\r\nside--shall we not first slay them?\"\r\n\r\nAllan thought. For the first time he now realized clearly the terrible\r\nperil that lay in these two Anthropoids already inside the limits of\r\nthe colony.\r\n\r\nHe peered up the pathway. No sign of them above. Their animal cunning\r\nhad warned them not to descend to certain death.\r\n\r\nNow Allan knew they were at liberty inside the palisades, waiting,\r\nwatching, constituting a deadly menace at every turn.\r\n\r\nIn any one of a thousand places they could lie ambushed, behind trees\r\nor bushes, or in the limbs aloft, and thence, unseen, they could\r\ndischarge an indefinite number of darts.\r\n\r\nIt was now perilous in the extreme even to venture back to the\r\npalisade. Any moment might bring a flicking, stinging messenger of\r\ndeath. Those two, alone, might easily decimate the remaining men of\r\nthe colony--and now each man was incalculably precious.\r\n\r\n\"Go, Frumuos,\" Allan again commanded. \"For the moment we must leave\r\nthose two up there. Go, muster all the fighting men and bring them up\r\nhere along the terrace. I must think! Go!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, before the messenger had even had time to disappear round\r\nthe first bend in the path, Allan found his inspiration.\r\n\r\n\"Regular warfare will never do it!\" he exclaimed decisively. \"They\r\nhave thousands where we have tens. Before we could pick them off with\r\nour firearms they'd have exhausted all our ammunition and have rushed\r\nus--and everything would be all over.\r\n\r\n\"No; there must be some quicker and more drastic way! Even dynamite or\r\nPulverite could never reach them all, swarming over there through\r\nmiles of forest. Only one thing can stand against them--_fire!_\r\n\r\n\"With fire we must sweep and purge the world, even though we destroy\r\nit! _With fire we must sweep the world!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE BESOM OF FLAME\r\n\r\n\r\nStern was not long in carrying out his plan.\r\n\r\nEven before Frumnos had returned, with the seventeen men still able to\r\nbear arms, he was at work.\r\n\r\nIn Cliff Villa he hastily lashed up half a dozen fireballs, of coarse\r\ncloth, thoroughly soaked them in oil, and, with a blazing torch,\r\nbrought them out to the terrace. Old Gesafam, at his command, bolted\r\nthe door behind him. At all hazards, Beta and the child must be\r\nprotected from any possibility of peril.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Frumnos!\" cried Stern.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master?\"\r\n\r\n\"Run quickly! Fetch the strongest bow in the colony and many arrows!\"\r\n\r\n\"I go, master!\"\r\n\r\nOnce more the man departed, running.\r\n\r\n\"Gad! If I only had my oxygen-containing bullets ready!\" thought\r\nStern, his mind reverting to an unfinished experiment down there in\r\nhis laboratory in the Rapids power-house. \"_They_ would turn the\r\ntrick, sure enough! They'd burst and rain fire everywhere. But they\r\naren't ready yet; and even if they were, nobody could venture down\r\nthere now!\"\r\n\r\nFor already, plainly visible on the farther edge of the canyon, scores\r\nand hundreds of the hideous little beast-men were beginning to swarm.\r\nTheir cries, despite the contrary stiff wind, carried across the\r\nriver; and here and there a dart broke against the cliff.\r\n\r\nAlready a few of the Anthropoids were beginning to scramble down the\r\nopposite wall of stone.\r\n\r\n\"Men!\" cried Allan commandingly, \"not one of those creatures must ever\r\nreach this terrace! Take good aim. Waste no single shot. Every bullet\r\nmust do its work!\"\r\n\r\nChoosing six of the best marksmen, he stationed them along the parapet\r\nwith rifles. The firing began at once.\r\n\r\nIrregularly the shots barked from the line of sharpshooters; and the\r\nlittle stabs of smoke, drifting out across the river, blent in a thin\r\nblue haze. Every moment or two, one of the Horde would writhe, scream,\r\nfall--or hang there twitching, to the cliff, with terrible, wild\r\nyells.\r\n\r\nStern greeted the return of Frumuos with eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" he exclaimed, scattering the arrows among half a dozen men.\r\n\"Bind these fireballs fast to the arrowheads!\"\r\n\r\nHe dealt out cord. In a moment the task was done.\r\n\r\n\"Sivad!\" he called a man by name. \"You, the best bowman of all! Here\r\nquickly!\"\r\n\r\nEven as Sivad fitted the first arrow to the string, and Stern was\r\nabout to apply the torch, a rattling crash from above caused all to\r\ncringe and leap aside.\r\n\r\nDown, leaping, ricochetting, thundering, hurtled a great boulder,\r\nspurning the cliff-face with a tremendous uproar.\r\n\r\nIt struck the parapet like a thirteen-inch shell, smashed out two\r\nyards of wall, and vanished in the depths. And after it, sliding,\r\nrattling and bouncing down, followed a rain of pebbles, fragments and\r\ndetritus.\r\n\r\n\"Those two above--they're attacking!\" shouted Stern. \"Quick--after\r\nthem! _You, you, you!_\"\r\n\r\nHe told off half a dozen men with rifles and revolvers.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, before they can hide! Look out for their darts! _Kill! Kill!_\"\r\n\r\nThe detachment started up the path at a run, eager for the hunt.\r\n\r\nStern set the flaring torch to the first fireball. It burst into\r\nbright flame.\r\n\r\n\"Shoot, Sivad! Shoot!\" he commanded. \"Shoot high, shoot far. Plant\r\nyour arrow there in the dry undergrowth where the wind whips the\r\njungle! Shoot and fail not!\"\r\n\r\nThe stout bowman drew his arrow to the head, back, back till the flame\r\nlicked his left hand.\r\n\r\n\"Zing-g-g-g-g!\"\r\n\r\nThe humming bowspring sang in harmony with the zooning arrow. A swift\r\nblue streak split the air, high above the river. In a quick trajectory\r\nit leaped.\r\n\r\nIt vanished in the wind-swept forest. Almost before it had\r\ndisappeared, Sivad had snatched another flaming arrow and had planted\r\nit farther down stream.\r\n\r\nOne by one, till all were gone, the marksman sowed the seed of\r\nconflagration. And all the while, from the rifles along the parapet,\r\ndeath went spitting at the forefront of invasion.\r\n\r\nAnother boulder fell from aloft, this time working havoc; for as one\r\nof the riflemen sprang to dodge, it struck a shoulder of limestone,\r\nbounded, and took him fair on the back.\r\n\r\nHis cry was smashed clean out; he and the stone, together, plumbed the\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nBut, as though to echo it, shots began to clatter up above. Then all\r\nat once they ceased; and a cheer floated away across the canyon.\r\n\r\n\"_They're_ done, those two up there, damn them!\" shouted Stern. \"And\r\nlook, men, look! The fire takes! _The woods begin to burn!_\"\r\n\r\nTrue! Already in three places, coils of greasy smoke were beginning to\r\nwrithe upward, as the resinous, dry undergrowth blossomed into red\r\nbouquets of flame.\r\n\r\nNow another fire burst out; then the two remaining ones. From six\r\ncenters the conflagration was already swiftly spreading.\r\n\r\nSmoke-clouds began to drift downwind; and from the forest depths arose\r\nnot only harsh cries from the panic-stricken Horde, but also beast and\r\nbird-calls as the startled fauna sought to flee this new, red terror.\r\n\r\nShouts and cheers of triumph burst from the little band of defenders\r\non the terrace as the sweeping wind, flailing the flame through the\r\nsun-dried underbrush, whirled it crackling aloft in a quick-leaping\r\nstorm of fire.\r\n\r\nBut Stern was silent as he watched the fierce and sudden onset of the\r\nconflagration. Between narrowed lids, as though calculating a grave\r\nproblem, he observed the crazed birds taking sudden flight, launching\r\ninto air and whirling drunkenly hither and yon with harsh cries for\r\ntheir last brief bit of life.\r\n\r\nHe listened to the animal calls in the forest and to the strange\r\ncrashings of the underwood as the creatures broke cover and in vain\r\nsought safety.\r\n\r\nMingled with these sounds were others--yells, shrieks, and\r\ngibberings--the tumult of the perishing Horde.\r\n\r\nSwiftly the fire spread to right and left, even as it ate northward\r\nfrom the river.\r\n\r\nThe mass of Anthropoids inevitably found themselves trapped; their\r\nslouching, awkward figures could here or there be seen in some clear\r\nspace, running wildly. Then, with a gust of flame, that space, too,\r\nvanished, and all was one red glare.\r\n\r\nThe riflemen, meanwhile, were steadily potting such of the little\r\ndemons as still were crawling up or down the cliffside opposite.\r\nSurely, relentlessly, they shot the invaders down. And, even as Stern\r\nwatched, the enemy melted and vanished before his eyes.\r\n\r\nAllan was thinking.\r\n\r\n\"What may this not result in?\" he wondered as he observed the swift\r\nand angry leap of the forest-fire to northward. \"It may ravage\r\nthousands of square miles before rain puts an end to it. It may\r\ndevastate the whole country. A change in the wind may even drive it\r\nback on us, across the river, sweeping all before it. This may mean\r\nruin!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, then said aloud:\r\n\r\n\"Ruin, perhaps. Yes; but the alternative was death! There was no other\r\nway!\"\r\n\r\nNow none of the attackers remained save a few feebly twitching,\r\nwrithing bodies caught on some protuberance of rock. Here, there, one\r\nof these fell, and like the rest was borne away down stream.\r\n\r\nThrough the heated air already verberated a strange roar as the\r\nforest-fire leaped up the opposite hillside in one clear lick of\r\nincandescence. This roar hummed through the heavens and trembled over\r\nthe long reaches of the river.\r\n\r\nThe fire jumped a little valley and took the second hill, burning as\r\nclear as any furnace, with a swift onward, upward slant as the wind\r\nfanned it forward through the dry brush and among the crowded palms.\r\n\r\nNow and then, with a muffled explosion, a sap-filled palm burst. Here,\r\nor yonder, some brighter flare showed where the fire had run at one\r\nclear leap right to the fronded top of a fern-tree.\r\n\r\nFire-brands and dry-kye, caught up by the swirl, spiralled through the\r\nthick air and fell far in advance of the main fire-army, each outpost\r\ncolonizing into swift destruction.\r\n\r\nAlready the nearer portion of the opposite cliff-edge was barren and\r\nsmoking, swept clean of life as a broom might sweep an ant-hill.\r\nTourbillons of dense smoke obscured the sky.\r\n\r\nThe air flew thick with brands, live coals and flaring bits of bark,\r\nall whirling aloft on the breath of the fire-demon. Showers of burning\r\njewels were sown broadcast by the resistless wind.\r\n\r\nStern, unspeakably saddened in spite of victory by this wholesale\r\ndestruction of forest, fruit and game, turned away from the\r\nmagnificent, the terrifying spectacle.\r\n\r\nHe left his riflemen staring at it, amazed and awed to silence by the\r\nsplendor of the flame-tempest, which they watched through their\r\neye-shields in absolute astonishment.\r\n\r\nBack to Cliff Villa he returned, his step heavy and his heart like\r\nlead. In a few brief hours, how great, how terrible, how devastating\r\nthe changes that had come upon Settlement Cliffs!\r\n\r\nAttack, destruction, pestilence and flame had all worked their will\r\nthere; and many a dream, a plan, a hope now lay in ashes, even like\r\nthose smoldering cinder-piles across the river--those pyres that\r\nmarked the death-field of the hateful, venomous, inhuman Horde!\r\n\r\nNumb with exhaustion and emotions, he staggered up the path, knocked,\r\nand was admitted to his home by the old nurse.\r\n\r\nHe heard the crying of his son, vigorously protesting against some\r\ninfant grievance, and his tired heart yearned with strong father-love.\r\n\r\n\"A hard world, boy!\" thought he. \"A hard fight, all the way through.\r\nGod grant, before you come to take the burden and the shock, I may\r\nhave been able to lighten both for you?\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman touched his arm.\r\n\r\n\"O, master! Is the fighting past?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is past and done, Gesafam. _That_ enemy, at least, will never come\r\nagain! But tell me, what causes the boy to cry?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is hungered, master. And I--I do not know the way to milk the\r\nstrange animal!\"\r\n\r\nDespite his exhaustion, pain and dour forebodings, Allan had to smile\r\na second.\r\n\r\n\"That's one thing you've got to learn, old mother!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\"I'll milk presently. But not just yet!\"\r\n\r\nFor first of all he must see Beatrice again. The boy must cry a bit,\r\ntill he had seen her!\r\n\r\nTo the bed he hastened, and beside it fell on his knees. His eager\r\neyes devoured the girl's face; his trembling hand sought her brow.\r\n\r\nThen a glad cry broke from his lips.\r\n\r\nHer face no longer burned with fever, and her pulse was slower now. A\r\nprofuse and saving perspiration told him the crisis had been passed.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God! Thank God!\" he breathed from his inmost soul. In his arms\r\nhe caught her. He drew her to his breast.\r\n\r\nAnd even in that hour of confusion and distress he knew the greatest\r\njoy of life was his.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nALLAN'S NARRATIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe week that followed was one of terrible labor, vigil and\r\nresponsibility for Stern. Not yet recovered from his wounds nor fully\r\nrested from his flight before the Horde--now forever happily wiped\r\nout--the man nevertheless plunged with untiring energy into the\r\nstupendous tasks before him.\r\n\r\nHe was at once the life, the brain, the inspiration of the colony.\r\nWithout him all must have perished. In the hollow of his hand he held\r\nthem, every one; and he alone it was who wrought some measure of\r\nreconstruction in the smitten settlement.\r\n\r\nOnce Beatrice was out of danger, he turned his attention to the\r\nothers. He administered his treatment and regimen with a strong hand,\r\nand allowed no opposition. Under his direction a little cemetery grew\r\nin the palisade--a mournful sight for this early stage in the\r\nreconstruction of the world.\r\n\r\nHere the Folk, according to their own custom, marked the graves with\r\ntotem emblems as down in the Abyss, and at night they wailed and\r\nchanted there under the bright or misty moon; and day by day the\r\nnumber of graves increased till more than twenty crowned the cliff.\r\n\r\nThe two Anthropoids were not buried, however, but were thrown into the\r\nriver from the place where they had been shot down while rolling rocks\r\nover the edge. They vanished in a tumbling, eddying swirl, misshapen\r\nand hideous to the last.\r\n\r\nWith his accustomed energy he set his men to work repairing the damage\r\nas well as possible, rearranging the living quarters, and bringing\r\norder out of chaos. Beta was now able to sit up a little. Allan\r\ndecided she must have had a touch of brain-fever.\r\n\r\nBut in his thankfulness at her recovery he took no great thought as to\r\nthe nature of the disease.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God, you're on the road to full recovery now, dear!\" he said to\r\nher on the tenth day as they sat together in the sun before the home\r\ncave. \"A mighty close call for you--and for the boy, too! Without that\r\ngood old goat what mightn't have happened? She'll be a privileged\r\ncharacter for life in these diggings.\"\r\n\r\nBeta laughed, and with a thin hand stroked his hair as he bent over\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember those funny goat-pictures Powers used to draw, a\r\nthousand years ago?\" she asked. \"Well, he ought to be here now to make\r\na sketch of you handing one to our kiddums? But--it was no joke, after\r\nall, was it? It was life and death for him!\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her tenderly, and for a while they said nothing. Then he\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"You're really feeling much--much better to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Awfully much! Why, I'm nearly well again! In a day or two I'll be at\r\nwork, just as though nothing had happened at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; you must rest a while. Just so you're better, that's enough\r\nfor me.\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice was really gaining fast. The fever had at least left her with\r\nan insatiable appetite.\r\n\r\nAllan decided she was now well enough again to nurse the baby. So he\r\nand the famous goat were mutually spared many a _mauvais quart\r\nd'heure_.\r\n\r\nTallying up matters and things on the evening of the twelfth day, as\r\nthey sat once more on the terrace in front of Cliff Villa, he\r\ninventoried the situation thus:\r\n\r\n  1--Twenty-six of the Folk are dead.\r\n  2--H'yemba is disposed of--praise be!\r\n  3--Forty still survive--twenty-eight men, nine women, three children.\r\n     Of these forty, thirty-three are sound.\r\n  4--The Pauillac is lost.\r\n  5--The bridge is destroyed, and eight of the caves are gone.\r\n  6--The entire forest area to the northward, as far as the eye can\r\n     reach, is totally devastated.\r\n  7--The Horde is wiped out.\r\n\r\n\"Some good items and some bad, you see, in this trial balance,\" he\r\ncommented as he checked up the items. \"It means a fresh start in some\r\nways, and no end of work. But, after all, the damage isn't fatal, as\r\nit might easily have been. We're about a thousand times better off\r\nthan there was any hope for.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't counted in your own wounds just healing, or the terrific\r\ntime you had with the Horde,\" suggested Beatrice. \"How in this world\r\nyou ever got through I don't see.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't either. It was a miracle, that's all. From the place where I\r\ndescended for a little repair work, and where they suddenly attacked\r\nus, to the colony, can't be less than one hundred and fifty miles. And\r\nsuch hills, valleys, jungles! Perfectly unimaginable difficulties,\r\nBeta! Now that I look back on it myself, I don't see how I ever got\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"They killed both the men you had with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but one of them not till the second day. You see, the carburetor\r\ngot clogged and wouldn't spray properly. I realized I could never\r\nreach Settlement Cliffs without overhauling it. So I scouted for a\r\nlikely place to land, far from any sign of the cursed signal-fires.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we hadn't been on the ground fifteen minutes before I'm blest\r\nif one of my men didn't hear the brushwood crackling to eastward.\r\n\r\n\"'O Kromno, master!' said he, clutching my arm, 'there come\r\ncreatures--many creatures--through the forest! Let us go!'\r\n\r\n\"I listened and heard it, too; and somehow--subconsciously, I guess--I\r\nknew an advance-guard of the Horde was on us!\r\n\r\n\"It was night, of course. My search-light was still burning, throwing\r\na powerful white glare into the thicket about a quarter-mile away,\r\nbeyond the sand-barren where I had taken earth. I turned it off, for I\r\nremembered how much better the Folk could see without artificial light\r\nin our night atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\"'Tell me, do you see anything?' I whispered.\r\n\r\n\"The other fellow pointed.\r\n\r\n\"'There, there!' he exclaimed. 'Little people! Many little people\r\ncoming through the trees!'\r\n\r\n\"For a moment I was paralyzed. What to do? There was no time now for a\r\ngetaway, even if the machine hadn't been out of order. My mind was in\r\na whirl, a rout, an utter panic. I confess, Beatrice, for once I was\r\nscared absolutely blue--\"\r\n\r\n\"No wonder! Who could have helped being?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you see, there was no way out. Lord knew how many of the\r\nlittle fiends were closing in on us; they might be on all sides. The\r\ncountry was much broken and absolutely new to me. I had no defenses to\r\nfight from, and it was night. Could anything have been worse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on, dear! What next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the Horde was coming on fast, and the darts beginning to patter\r\nin, so I saw we couldn't stay there. I had some vague idea of\r\nstratagem, I remember--some notion of leading the devils away on a\r\nlong chase, outdistancing them and then swinging round to the machine\r\nagain by daylight, and possibly fixing it up in time to skip out for\r\nhome. But--\"\r\n\r\n\"But it didn't work out that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly! I emptied my automatics into the brown of the advancing pack,\r\nand then retreated, flanked by my two men. They were keen to fight,\r\nthe Merucaans were--always ready for a mix--but I knew too much about\r\nthe poisoned arrows to let 'em. We stumbled off through the woods at a\r\ngood gait, crashing away like elephants, while always, apelike,\r\ncreeping and hideous, the little hairy beast-people stole and\r\nslithered among the palms.\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"Heavens!\" she exclaimed. \"I--I'd have died of sheer fright!\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't feel like dying of fright, but I infernally near died of\r\nrage when in about five minutes I saw a flicker of flame through the\r\njungle, and then a brighter glare.\"\r\n\r\n\"They burned the Pauillac?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess so. I never went back to see. They probably burned the\r\nplanes, and tried to batter up the rest of it with rocks and things.\r\nThey wrecked it all right enough, I guess. _That_ was for the attack\r\nwe made on 'em from its safe elevation at the bungalow. Well--\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can hardly remember. We trekked south, as near as I could reckon\r\nit, or south by east, with New Hope River as our objective-point. Oh,\r\nwhat's the use trying to tell it all? You know the jungle at night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wild beasts, you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"And snakes, Beta! _Some_ sensation to step on a copperhead and then\r\nleap off just in time to miss the snap of the fangs, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't Allan! Don't!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right; I'll skip that part. Anyhow, we hiked till daybreak, when\r\nmy men began to complain of severe pain in the eyes. I had to stop and\r\nrig up some shields for them, and smear their hands and faces with mud\r\nto keep off the sun. Well, we managed to eat a little fruit and get a\r\ndrink of water; but as for rest, there was none. For inside an hour,\r\nhanged if the darts didn't begin dropping again!\"\r\n\r\n\"They'd come up with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe. Or else it was another group of 'em. No telling. The whole\r\ncountry seemed to swarm with the devils. Anyhow, we had to mosey\r\nagain. But--well--one of the darts got home on my best fighter.\r\nAnd--h-m!--he didn't last five minutes. He turned a kind of\r\nbluish-green, too. And swelled a good bit. I'll spare you the details,\r\nBeta. At any rate, we had to leave him. So there were only two of us\r\nnow, and God knew where home was, or how many thousand of the hairy\r\ndevils were lying in ambush on the way. So then--\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do?\" she asked, shuddering.\r\n\r\n\"We hiked, and kept on hiking! All day we beat and trampled through\r\nthe forest, and toward night there was no more go in us. So we decided\r\nto make a stand. Pretty objects we were, too, torn and bruised, mired\r\nfrom swamps clear to our waists, and a mass of scratches and bruises!\r\nWell, we hadn't long to wait when the attack was on again.\r\n\r\n\"I gave my one remaining man the spare automatic, and showed him how\r\nto handle it; and for about an hour we stood off the devils. But they\r\nflanked us, and all at once my man grunted and pitched forward. I'm\r\ndamned if they hadn't driven a spear clean through his lungs!\r\n\r\n\"After that, good God! it was just a man-hunt, endless and horrible,\r\nthrough trackless wilds, over hills and mountains, through valleys,\r\nacross rivers, Heaven knows where! But I always tried to keep my wits\r\nand beat to southward, hoping, ever hoping I might reach the New Hope.\r\nWell--now and then I could get far enough ahead to snatch a bite or a\r\ndrink. Twice I slept--twice, in about a week; think of that, will you?\r\nOnce in a hollow tree, and once under a rock-ledge. Only a few hours\r\nin all. But it helped. Without that I couldn't have got through.\"\r\n\r\nShe took his hand, and kissed and caressed it.\r\n\r\n\"My Allan!\" she whispered, while in her eyes the tears started hot.\r\n\"You suffered all that just to come home again?\"\r\n\r\n\"What else was there to do? The last few days I hardly knew anything\r\nat all. It was a daze, a dream, a nightmare. There was so much pain in\r\nevery part that no one part could hurt very much. The bushes pretty\r\nnearly stripped every rag of clothes off me--and the skin, as well. My\r\nsandals went all to pieces. I lost my sense of direction a hundred\r\ntimes, and must have often doubled on my tracks. I ate and drank what\r\nI could get, like an animal. Once, in a period of lucidity, I remember\r\nfinding a nest of fledgling birds. I crunched them down alive,\r\npin-feathers and all! Well--\"\r\n\r\n\"My boy! My poor, lost, tortured boy!\"\r\n\r\n\"When they wounded me I never even knew. All I know is that the spear\r\nwasn't one of the poisoned ones. Otherwise--\"\r\n\r\n\"There, there! Don't think about it any more, darling! Don't tell me\r\nany more. I know enough. It's too awful! Let's both try to forget!\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess that's the best way, after all,\" he answered. \"I found the\r\nriver somehow, after a thousand or two eternities. Instinct must have\r\nguided me, for I turned upstream in the right direction. And after\r\nthat, all I remember is seeing the bridge across to Settlement\r\nCliffs.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so you came home to us again, darling?\"\r\n\r\n\"So I came home. Love led me, Beatrice. It was my chart and compass\r\nthrough the wilderness. Not even pain and hunger could confuse them.\r\nNothing but death could ever blot them out!\"\r\n\r\n\"And after all you'd been through, dear, you did what you did for us?\r\nWithout resting? Without delay or respite?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's life,\" he answered simply. \"That's the price of the new world.\r\nHe who would build must suffer!\"\r\n\r\nHer arms embraced him, her breath was warm upon his face, and in the\r\nkiss that burned itself upon his eager lips he knew some measure of\r\nthe sweetness of reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nINTO THE FIRE-SWEPT WILDERNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nLess than three weeks after the extermination of the Horde,\r\nStern had already completed important measures looking toward the\r\nrehabilitation of the colony.\r\n\r\nThe damage had been largely repaired. Now only some half-dozen\r\nconvalescent cases still remained on the sick-list. What the colony\r\nhad lost in numbers it had gained in solidarity and a truer loyalty\r\nthan ever before felt there.\r\n\r\nAll the survivors, now vastly more faithful to the common cause than\r\nin the beginning, showed an eager longing to lay hold of the impending\r\nproblems with Stern, and to labor faithfully for the future of the\r\ngreat undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe fishing, hunting and domestication of wild animals all were\r\nresumed, and again the sound of hammers and anvils clanked through the\r\ncaves.\r\n\r\nUnder Stern's direction, half a dozen men crossed the pools in boats,\r\ndescended the north bank of the river, and got hold of the cut bridge\r\ncables.\r\n\r\nStern shot a thin line over to them by means of a bow and arrow. With\r\nthis they pulled a stouter cord across, and finally a strong cable.\r\nAll hands together soon brought the bridge once more up the cliff,\r\nwhere it was lashed to its old moorings.\r\n\r\nBarring a few broken floor-planks, easily replaced, only slight damage\r\nhad been done. One day's labor sufficed to put it in repair again.\r\n\r\nThe parapet was rebuilt and a wall constructed across the end of the\r\nbroken terrace. Work was begun on new cave dwellings, with great care\r\nnot to weaken the strata and so invite another disaster.\r\n\r\nStern, very wise by now in gauging the barbarian mentality, undertook\r\nno direct punishment of such as had been led away by H'yemba. But he\r\ngathered all the Folk together in the palisade, and there--close to\r\nthe mutely eloquent object-lesson of the little cemetery--he made them\r\na charweg, a talk in their own speech.\r\n\r\n\"My people!\" cried he, erect and strong before them all, \"listen now,\r\nfor this thing ye must know!\r\n\r\n\"The evil of your hearts, thinking to prevail against me and the Law,\r\nhath brought ye misery and death! Ye have rebelled against the Law,\r\nand behold, many are now dead--innocent as well as guilty. The\r\nlandslide smote ye, and enemies came enemies far more terrible than\r\nthe dreaded Lanskaarn ye fought in the Abyss! But a little more and ye\r\nhad all died with battle and disaster. Only my hand alone saved\r\nye--all who still live to breathe this upper air.\r\n\r\n\"Men! Ye beheld my doing with the earthquake and the Horde! Ye beheld,\r\ntoo, my answer to H'yemba, the evil man, the rebel and traitor. Him ye\r\nsaw hurled, bleeding, from the parapet! That was my answer to his\r\ninsolence! And if not he, then who can ever stand against me?\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, and swept them with his glance, letting the lesson sink\r\ndeep home. Before him their eyes were lowered; their heads bowed; and\r\nthrough them all ran murmurs of fear and supplication.\r\n\r\n\"My Folk! Rightly might I be angered with you, and require sacrifice\r\nand still more blood; but I am merciful. I shall not punish; I shall\r\nonly teach, and guide, and help! For my heart is your heart, and ye\r\nare precious in my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"But, hark ye now, and think, and judge for yourselves! If any ever\r\nspeak again of rebellion, or of treason, and seek to break the Law, on\r\nhis head shall be the blood of all. For surely woe shall come again on\r\nus. In your own behalf I warn you, and ye shall be the judges. Now\r\nanswer me, O my Folk, what shall be done unto any who rebels?\"\r\n\r\n\"He shall die!\" boomed the voice of Zangamon. The loyal fighter, now\r\nlean and gaunt with great labors, but still powerful, raised his\r\ncorded hand on high. \"Of a truth, that man shall die!\"\r\n\r\n\"What death?\" cried Stern.\r\n\r\n\"Even the death of H'yemba! Let him be cast from the parapet to death\r\nin the white rushing river far below!\"\r\n\r\nAll echoed the cry: \"Death to all traitors, from the rock!\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it, then,\" Stern concluded. \"Ye have spoken, and it shall be\r\nwritten as a Law. From Execution Rock shall all conspirators be cast.\r\nNow go!\"\r\n\r\nHe dismissed them. While they departed and filed down the terraces to\r\ntheir own homes, he stood there with folded arms, watching them very\r\ngravely. The last one vanished. He nodded.\r\n\r\n\"They'll do now!\" said he to himself. \"No more trouble from that\r\nsource! Another milestone passed along the road of self-control,\r\nself-government and communal spirit. Ah, but the road's a long one\r\nyet--a long and hard and stony road to follow!\"\r\n\r\nNext day Stern began making his plans for the recovery of the lost\r\naeroplane.\r\n\r\n\"This is by far the most important matter now before the colony,\" he\r\ntold Beatrice, watching her nurse the boy as they sat by the fire,\r\nwhile outside the rain drummed over cliff and canyon, hill and plain.\r\n\"Our very life depends on keeping a free means of communication open\r\nwith the mother-country of the Folk, so to call it, and with the\r\ncity-ruins that supply us with so many necessary articles. No other\r\nform of transportation will do. At all hazards we _must_ have an\r\naeroplane--one at least, more later, if possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" she answered; \"but why not make one here? Down there in\r\nyour workshop--\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the equipment yet,\" he interrupted; \"nor yet the necessary\r\nmetal, the wire, a hundred things. All that will come in time when we\r\nget some mines to work and start a few blast-furnaces. But for the\r\npresent, the best and quickest thing to do will be to look up the old\r\nmachine again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" she objected, terrified at thought of losing him again: \"but I\r\nthought you said the Horde wrecked it!\"\r\n\r\n\"So they did; but beasts like that probably couldn't destroy the vital\r\nmechanism beyond possibility of repair. That is, not unless they\r\nheaped a lot of wood all over it, and heated it white-hot, which I\r\ndon't think they had intelligence enough to do. In any event, what's\r\nleft will serve me as a model, for another machine. I really think\r\nI'll have to have a try for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Allan! You aren't going to venture out into the wilderness\r\nagain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not, dearest? You must remember the forest is all burned now;\r\nperhaps for hundreds of miles. And the Horde, the one greatest peril\r\nthat has dogged us ever since those days in the tower, has been swept\r\nout with the besom of flame!\"\r\n\r\n\"Which has also surely destroyed the machine, even if _they_ haven't!\"\r\nshe exclaimed, using every possible argument to discourage him.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly think so,\" he judged. \"You see, I left it in a wide\r\nsand-barren. I think, on the whole, it will pay me to make the\r\nexpedition. Of course I shan't take less than a dozen men to help me\r\nbring it back--what's left of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Allan, can you find your way?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got to! That machine must positively be recovered! Otherwise\r\nwe're totally cut off from the Abyss. Colonizing stops, and all kinds\r\nof hell may break loose below ground before I can build another\r\nmachine entire. There are no railroads running now to the brink,\" he\r\nadded smiling; \"and no elevators to the basement of the world. It's\r\nthe old Pauillac again or nothing!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl exhausted all her arguments and entreaties in vain. Once\r\nAllan's mind was definitely made up along the line of duty, he went\r\nstraight forward, though the heavens fell.\r\n\r\nFour days later the expedition set out.\r\n\r\nAllan had made adequate preparations in every way. He left a strong\r\nand well-armed guard to protect Settlement Cliffs. By careful thought\r\nand chart-drawing he was able to approximate the probable position of\r\nthe machine. With him he took fifteen men, headed by Zangamon, who now\r\ninsisted he was well enough to go, and ably seconded by Frumuos.\r\n\r\nEach man carried an automatic, and six had rifles. They bore an\r\naverage of one hundred cartridges apiece, and in knapsacks of\r\ngoat-leather, dried rations for a week. Each also carried fish hooks\r\nand a stout fiber line.\r\n\r\nThe party counted on being able to supplement their supplies with\r\ntrout, bass and pickerel from countless untouched streams. They might,\r\ntoo, come into wooded country, if the fire had left any to northward,\r\nand here they knew game would be plentiful.\r\n\r\nOne thing seemed positive in that new world: starvation could not\r\nthreaten.\r\n\r\nCloudy and dull the morning was--yet well-suited to the needs of the\r\nFolk--when the expedition left Settlement Cliffs. The convoy, each man\r\nprovided with eye-guards and his hands and face well painted with\r\nprotecting pigment, waited impatiently in the palisade, while Allan\r\nsaid farewell to Beta and the little chap.\r\n\r\nFor a long moment he strained them both to his breast, then, the\r\nwoman's kiss still hot upon his lips, ran quickly up the path and\r\njoined his picked troop of scouts.\r\n\r\n\"Forward, men!\" cried he, taking the lead with Zangamon.\r\n\r\nSome minutes later Beatrice saw them defiling over the long, shaking\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nThrough her tears she watched them, waving her hand to Allan--even\r\nmaking the baby shake its little hand as well--and throwing kisses to\r\nhim, who returned them gaily.\r\n\r\nOn the far bank the party halted a minute to shout a few last words to\r\nthe assembled colonists that lined the parapet of the terrace.\r\n\r\nThen they turned, and, striking northwest, plunged boldly into the\r\nburned and blackened waste.\r\n\r\nLong after the marching column had disappeared over the crest of the\r\nsecond hill Beatrice still watched. Up on the cliff-top, with the\r\npowerful telescope at her eye, she followed the faint, drifting line\r\nof dust and ash that marked the line of march.\r\n\r\nOnly when this, too, had disappeared, merged in the somber gray of the\r\nhorizon, did she sadly and very slowly descend the path once more,\r\nback to the loneliness of a home where now no husband's presence\r\ngreeted her.\r\n\r\nThough she tried to smile--tried to believe all would yet be well, old\r\nGesafam, glancing up from her labors at the cooking-hearth, saw tears\r\nwere shining in her beautiful gray eyes.\r\n\r\nBarbarian though the ancient beldame was, she knew, she understood\r\nthat after all, now as for all time, in every venture and in every\r\ntask, the woman's portion was the harder one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nA STRANGE APPARITION\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a good round pace, where open going permitted, the party\r\nmade way, striking boldly across country in the probable direction of\r\nthe lost aeroplane.\r\n\r\nSome marched in silence, thoughtfully; others sang, as though setting\r\nout upon the Great Sunken Sea in fishing boats. But one common purpose\r\nand ambition thrilled them all.\r\n\r\nA man less boldly resourceful than Allan Stern must have thought long,\r\nand long hesitated, before thus plunging into a desolated and unknown\r\nterritory on such a hunt.\r\n\r\nFor, to speak truth, the finding of the needle in the haystack would\r\nhave been as easy as any hope of ever locating the machine in all\r\nthose thousands of square miles of devastation.\r\n\r\nBut Stern felt no fear. The great need of the colony made the\r\nexpedition imperative; his supreme self-trust rendered it possible.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of things, back there in the tower overlooking\r\nMadison Forest, he had never even admitted the possibility of failure\r\nin any undertaking. Defeat lay wholly outside his scheme of things.\r\nThat it could ever be his portion simply never had occurred to him.\r\n\r\nAs they progressed he carefully reviewed everything in his mind. Plans\r\nand equipment seemed perfectly adequate. In addition to the\r\nimpedimenta already mentioned, a few necessary tools, a supply of\r\ncordage for transporting the machine, and three bottles of brandy for\r\nemergencies had been judiciously added to the men's burdens.\r\n\r\nEach, in addition, carried a small flat water-jug, tightly stopped,\r\nslung over his shoulder. Allan counted on streams being plentiful; but\r\nhe meant to look out even for the unexpected, too.\r\n\r\nHe had wisely taken means to protect their feet for the long tramp. In\r\nspite of all their opposition he had made them prepare and bind on\r\nsandals of goat's leather. Hitherto they had gone barefooted at\r\nSettlement Cliffs; but now that w as no longer permissible.\r\n\r\nThe total equipment of each man weighed not less than one hundred\r\npounds, including tools and all. No weaklings, like the men of the\r\ntwentieth century, could have stood the gaff marching under such a\r\nload; but these huge fellows, muscular and lithe, walked off with it\r\nas though it had been a mere nothing.\r\n\r\nAllan himself bore an equal burden. In addition to arms and provisions\r\nhe carried a powerful binocular, the spoil of a wrecked optician's\r\nshop in Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nUnderfoot, as the column advanced in a long line, loose dust and\r\nwood-ashes rose in clouds. The air grew thick and irritating to the\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\nNow and then they had to make a detour round a charred and fallen\r\ntrunk, or cut their way and clamber through a calcined barricade of\r\ntwisted limbs and branches. Not infrequently they saw burned bones of\r\nanimals or of Anthropoids.\r\n\r\nHere and there they even stumbled on a distorted, half-consumed\r\nbody--a hideous reminder of the vanquished enemy--the half-man that\r\nhad tried to pit itself against the whole-man, with inevitable\r\nannihilation as the only possible result.\r\n\r\nThe distorted attitudes of some of these ghastly, incredibly ugly\r\ncarcasses told with eloquence the terrified, vain flight of the Horde\r\nbefore the all-consuming storm of fire, the panic and the anguish of\r\ntheir extinction.\r\n\r\nBut Allan only grunted or smiled grimly at sight of the horrible\r\nlittle bodies. Pity he felt no more than for a crushed and hideous\r\ncopperhead.\r\n\r\nThe country had been swept clean by the fire-broom. Not a living\r\ncreature remained visible. Moles there still might be, and perhaps\r\nhares and foxes, woodchucks, groundhogs and a few such animals that by\r\nchance had taken earth; but even of these there was no trace.\r\nCertainly all larger breeds had been destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhere paradise-birds, macaws and paroquets had screamed and flitted,\r\nhumming-birds darted with a whir of gauzy wings, serpents writhed,\r\ndeer browsed, monkeys and apes swung chattering from the\r\nliana-festooned fern-trees, now all was silence, charred ashes,\r\ndust--the universal, blank awfulness of death.\r\n\r\nNaked and ugly the country stretched away, away to its black horizon,\r\nridge after ridge of rolling land stubbled with sparse, limbless\r\ntrunks and carpeted with cinders.\r\n\r\nA dead world truly, it seemed--how infinitely different from the lush,\r\ngreen beauty of the territory south of the New Hope, a region Stern\r\nstill could make out as a bluish blur, far to southward, through his\r\nbinoculars.\r\n\r\nBy night, after having eaten dinner beside a turbid, brackish pool,\r\nthey had made more than twenty miles to northwestward. Stern thought\r\nscornfully of the distance. In his Pauillac he would have covered it\r\neasily in as many minutes.\r\n\r\nBut now all was different. Nothing remained save slow, laborious\r\nplodding, foot by foot, through the choking desolation of the burned\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThey camped near a small stream for the night, and cast their lines,\r\nbut took nothing. Stern gave this matter no great weight. He thought,\r\nperhaps, it might be a mere accident, and still felt confident of\r\nfinding fish elsewhere.\r\n\r\nEven the discovery of three or four dead perch, floating belly up,\r\nround and round in an eddy, gave him no clue to the total destruction\r\nof all life. He did not understand even yet that the terrific\r\nconflagration, far more stupendous than any ever known in the old\r\ndays, had even heated the streams and killed there the very fish\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nYet already a vague, half-sensed uneasiness had begun to creep over\r\nhim--not yet a definite presentiment of disaster, but rather a\r\nsubconscious feeling that the odds against him were too great.\r\n\r\nAnd once a thought of Napoleon crossed his mind as he sat there\r\nsilently, camped with his men; and he remembered Moscow, with a\r\nstrange, new apprehension.\r\n\r\nNext morning, having refilled their canteens, they set out again,\r\nstill in the same direction. Stern often consulted his chart, to be\r\nsure they were proceeding in what he took to be the proper course.\r\n\r\nThe distance between Settlement Cliffs and the machine was wholly\r\nproblematical; yet, once he should come within striking distance of\r\nthe scene of his disaster, he felt positive of being able to recognize\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNot far to the south of the spot, he remembered, a very steep and\r\nnoisy stream flowed toward the east, and, off to northwest of it rose\r\na peculiarly formed, double-peaked mountain, easily recognizable.\r\n\r\nThe sand-barren itself, where he had been obliged to abandon the\r\nmachine, lay in a kind of broad valley, flanked on one hand by cliffs,\r\nwhile the other sloped gradually upward to the foot-hills of the\r\ndouble mountain in question.\r\n\r\n\"Once I get anywhere within twenty miles of it I'm all right,\" thought\r\nAllan, anxiously sweeping the horizon with his binoculars as the party\r\npaused on a high ridge to rest. \"The great problem is to locate that\r\nmountain. After that the rest will be easy.\"\r\n\r\nAt noon they camped again, ate sparingly, and rested an hour. Here\r\nAllan brought his second map up to date. This map, a large sheet of\r\nparchment, served as a record of distances and directions traveled.\r\n\r\nStarting at Settlement Cliffs he had painstakingly entered on it every\r\nstage of the journey, every ridge and valley, watercourse, camp and\r\nlandmark. Once the goal reached, this record would prove invaluable in\r\nretracing their way.\r\n\r\n\"If the rest of the trip were only indicated as well as what's past!\"\r\nhe muttered, working out his position. \"One of these days, when other\r\nthings are attended to, we must have a geodetic survey, complete maps\r\nand plans, and accurate information about the whole topography of this\r\naltered continent. Some time--along with a few million other necessary\r\nthings!\"\r\n\r\nThe third day brought them nowhere. Still the brule stretched\r\non and on before them, though now, far to right, Allan occasionally\r\ncould glimpse a wooded mountain-spur through the binoculars, as though\r\nthe limits of the vast conflagration were in sight at least in one\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nBut to left and ahead nothing still showed but devastated land.\r\n\r\nThe character of the country, however, had begun to change. The\r\nvalleys had grown deeper and the ridges higher. Allan felt that they\r\nwere now coming into a more mountainous region.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's encouraging, anyhow,\" he reflected. \"Any time, now, I\r\nmay sight the double-peaked mountain. It can't heave in sight any too\r\nsoon to suit _me!_\"\r\n\r\nThere was need of sighting it, indeed, for already the party had begun\r\nto suffer not a little. The perpetual tramping through ashes had\r\nstarted cracks and sores forming on the men's feet. Most of them were\r\ncoughing and sneezing much of the time, with a kind of influenza\r\ncaused by the acrid and biting dust.\r\n\r\nThe dried food, too, had started an intolerable thirst, and water was\r\nterribly scarce. The canteens were now almost always empty; and more\r\nthan one brook or pool, to which the men eagerly hastened, turned out\r\nto be saline or hopelessly fouled by fallen forest wreckage, festering\r\nand green-slimed in the cooking sun.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the eye-shields and pigments, some of the men were already\r\nsuffering from sunburn and ophthalmia, which greatly impaired their\r\nefficiency. Their failure to take fish was also beginning to\r\ndishearten them.\r\n\r\nAllan pondered the advisability of suspending day travel and trekking\r\nonly by night, but had to give over this plan, for it would obviate\r\nall possibility of his sighting the landmark, the cleft mountain.\r\nThough he said nothing, the pangs of apprehension were biting deep\r\ninto his soul.\r\n\r\nFor the first time that night the idea was strongly borne in upon him\r\nthat, after all, this might be little better than a wild-goose chase,\r\nand that--despite his desperate need of the Pauillac engine--perhaps\r\nthe better part of valor might be discretion, retreat, return to\r\nSettlement Cliffs while there might still be time.\r\n\r\nYet even the few hours of troubled sleep he got that night, camped in\r\na blackened ravine, served to strengthen his determination to push on\r\nagain at all hazards.\r\n\r\n\"It can't be far now!\" thought he. \"The place simply can't be very\r\nfar! We must have made the best part of the distance already. What\r\nmadness to turn back now and lose all we've struggled so hard to gain!\r\nNo, no--on we go again! Forward to success!\"\r\n\r\nNext morning, therefore--the fourth since having left New Hope\r\nRiver--the party pushed forward again. It was now a strange\r\nprocession, limping and slow, the men blinking through their shields,\r\ntheir hands and faces smeared with mud and ashes.\r\n\r\nPainfully, yet without a word of complaint or rebellion, they once\r\nmore trailed over the fire-blasted hills on the quest of the wrecked\r\nPauillac.\r\n\r\nHour by hour they were now forced to pause for rest. Some of the\r\nimpedimenta had to be discarded. During the forenoon Allan commanded\r\nthat most of the fishing-gear and part of the cordage should be thrown\r\naway.\r\n\r\nToward mid-afternoon he sorted out the tools, and kept only an\r\nessential minimum. Now that they had seen no possible need for\r\nammunition, he decided to leave half of that also.\r\n\r\nThe tools and ammunition he carefully cached under a rock-cairn and\r\nset a tall, burned pole up over it, with a cross-piece lashed near the\r\ntop. The position of this cairn he minutely noted on his map. Some day\r\nhe would return and get the valuables again.\r\n\r\nNothing could be spared from the provision packets, but these were\r\nmuch lighter, anyhow. This helped a little. But Allan could see that\r\nthe strength of his men, and his own force as well, was diminishing\r\nfaster than the burden.\r\n\r\nSo, with a heavy heart, now half inclined to abandon the task and turn\r\nback, he surveyed the horizon for the last time that night in vain\r\nsearch for the landmark mountain of his hopes.\r\n\r\nMorning dawned again pitilessly hot and sun-parched. By five o'clock\r\nthe party was under way, to make at least a few miles before the\r\ngreatest heat should set in.\r\n\r\nAllan realized that this must be the crucial day. Either by nightfall\r\nhe must sight the mountain or he must turn back. And with\r\nfever-burning eagerness he urged his limping men to greater speed,\r\nchafed at every delay, constantly examined the horizon, and with\r\nconsuming wrath cursed the Horde which in its venomous hate had\r\nbrought this anguish and disaster on his people.\r\n\r\nJust a little past eight o'clock a cry suddenly burst from Zangamon,\r\nwho had left the line during a pause to look for water in a near-by\r\nhollow.\r\n\r\nStern heard the man's hoarse voice unmistakably resonant with terror.\r\nTo him he ran.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Zangamon?\" he cried thickly, for his tongue was parched\r\nand swollen. \"What have you found? Quick, tell me!\"\r\n\r\n\"See, O Kromno! Behold!\" exclaimed the man, pointing.\r\n\r\nStern looked--and saw a human body, charred and distorted, face\r\ndownward on the blackened earth. Up through the back something\r\nprojected--something hard and sharp.\r\n\r\nHe stooped, wide-eyed, staring at the thing.\r\n\r\n\"A spear-head, so help me!\"\r\n\r\nThen he realized the truth. They had found one of his slaughtered\r\ncompanions of the terrible flight from the Horde!\r\n\r\nStern recoiled. Shocked though he was, yet a certain joy possessed\r\nhim. For now he knew he could not be far from the path of success. The\r\nwrecked machine, he knew, could not lie more than one or two days'\r\nmarch ahead. If the party could only last that long--\r\n\r\nThe others came hobbling. When they, too, saw the mournful object and\r\nknew and understood, a deep silence fell upon them. In a circle they\r\nsurrounded the corpse of their murdered comrade, and for a while they\r\nlooked on it with woe.\r\n\r\nAllan realized that he must not let inaction, thought and fear prey on\r\nthem, so he commanded immediate burial of the body.\r\n\r\nThey therefore dug a shallow grave in the baked soil, and, taking good\r\ncare not to touch the poisoned spear-head, carefully laid their\r\ncompanion to rest. Over the filled-in grave they heaved rocks.\r\n\r\n\"Does anybody know his name?\" asked Allan.\r\n\r\n\"He was called Relzang,\" answered Frumnos. \"I knew him well--a\r\nmetal-worker, of the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so--now I remember,\" assented Stern. \"What was his totem?\"\r\n\r\n\"A circle, with a bird's head within.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it be placed here, then.\"\r\n\r\nTheir best stone-cutter roughly hewed the mark in a great boulder,\r\nwhich was set on top of the pile. Then nothing more remaining to do,\r\nthe exploring party once more pushed forward.\r\n\r\nBut Allan could sense that now even its diminished strength had\r\ngreatly lessened. Discouragement and forebodings of certain death were\r\nworking among the men.\r\n\r\nHe knew he could not hold them more than a few hours longer at the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nDuring the noonday halt and rest, under a low cliff, he made a\r\ncharweg, saying:\r\n\r\n\"O my people, barring the matter of the patriarch's death, I have\r\nalways spoken truth to you. Now I speak truth. This shall be the last\r\nday. Ye have been brave and strong, uncomplaining in great trials, and\r\nobedient. I shall reward ye greatly. But I am wise. I will not drive\r\nye too far. The end is at hand.\r\n\r\n\"Either I see the cleft mountain by to-morrow night or we return. I\r\nshall push no farther forward than the march of one day and a half.\r\nAfter that I shall either have the flying boat or we shall go quickly\r\nto our safe home at Settlement Cliffs.\r\n\r\n\"Be of good heart, therefore. The return will be much easier and\r\nshorter. We can follow the picture of the way that I have made.\r\nDespair not. All shall be well. I have spoken.\"\r\n\r\nThey greeted his promise with murmurs of approbation, but made no\r\nanswer, for body and soul were grievously tried. When he gave the\r\norder to advance again, however, they buckled into the toil with a\r\ngood heart. Their morale, he plainly saw, had been markedly improved\r\nby his few words.\r\n\r\nAnd, now filled with hot, new hope, once more he led the painful\r\nmarch, his binoculars every few minutes swinging round the far horizon\r\nin a vain attempt to sight the longed for height.\r\n\r\nBut other events were destined and were written on the book of fate.\r\nFor, as they topped a high ridge about five o'clock that\r\nafternoon--dragging themselves along, parched and spent, rather than\r\nmarching--Allan made a halt for careful observations from this\r\nvantage-post.\r\n\r\nThe men sank down, eager to lie prone even for a few minutes on the\r\nash-covered soil, to hide their eyes and pant like hard-run hunting\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\nAllan himself felt hardly the strength to remain upright; but he\r\nforced himself to stand there, and with a tremendous effort held the\r\nglass true as it slowly scoured the sky-line to north and west.\r\n\r\nAll at once he uttered a choking cry. The glass shook in his wasted\r\nhands. His eyes, staring, refused their office, and a strange purple\r\nblur seemed to blot the horizon from his sight.\r\n\r\nWith the binoculars he stared at a point N. N. W., where he had\r\nthought to see the incredible apparition; but now nothing appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Hallucinations, so soon?\" he muttered, rubbing his eyes. \"Come, come,\r\nbuck up! This won't do at all!\"\r\n\r\nAnd again he searched the place with his powerful lenses.\r\n\r\n\"My God! but I _do_ see them--and they're real--they're moving, too!\"\r\nhe exclaimed. \"No hallucination, no mirage! They're _there!_ But--but\r\nwhat--_What can this mean? Who can they be?_\"\r\n\r\nTiny and clear against the dazzling background of the afternoon sky he\r\nhad perceived a long line of human figures trekking to southeast over\r\nthe distant hill-top, almost directly toward the point where his\r\nexhausted troop now lay inert and panting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE MEETING OF THE BANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nConvinced though Stern now was of the reality of the amazing\r\nsight he had just witnessed through his binoculars, yet for a long\r\nmoment he remained silent and staring, utterly at a loss for any\r\nrational explanation of the remarkable apparition.\r\n\r\nExhausted in body and confused in mind, he could hit upon no answer to\r\nthe riddle.\r\n\r\nMight these be some detached and belated members of the Horde? No; for\r\ntheir figures and their gait, as he now for the third time studied\r\nthem through the glass, were unmistakably human.\r\n\r\nBut if not Anthropoids, then what? Enemies? Potential friends? Some\r\nnew and strange race, until now undiscovered?\r\n\r\nA score of possible explanations struggled in his mind, only to be\r\nrejected. But this was now no time for questions, analysis, or\r\nthought. For, even as he looked, the end of the line came to view,\r\nthen vanished down the blackened hillside.\r\n\r\nInvisible, now that they no longer stood silhouetted against the\r\nsky-line, the strange company had disappeared as though swallowed up\r\nby the earth. Yet Stern well knew that they were coming almost\r\ndirectly down upon him and his little party. Already there was\r\npressing need for swift decision.\r\n\r\nWhat should he do? Advance to meet these strangers? Risk all on a mere\r\nchance? Or turn, retreat and hide? Or ambush them, and kill?\r\n\r\nHe found himself, for the moment, unable to make up his mind. Yet,\r\nshould a pinch arise and the last contingency become necessary, he\r\nfelt a powerful advantage. He was positive his little band, armed as\r\nthey were, could easily wipe out this column. But, after all, must he\r\nfight?\r\n\r\nHis questions all unsettled and his mind confused from the terrible\r\nexhaustions of the march, he waited. He surveyed the neighborhood,\r\nwith a view to possible battle.\r\n\r\nOn his left rose a ridge that swung to northward between the advancing\r\ncolumn and his own position. On his right an arroyo or gully, choked\r\nwith fallen tree-trunks and burned forest wreckage, descended in an\r\neasterly direction toward a rather deep valley. In this gully he saw\r\nwas ample hiding-place for his whole force.\r\n\r\n\"Men!\" he addressed them; \"it is strange to tell, but there be others\r\nwho come against us there!\" He pointed at the far crest of the sawlike\r\nhighlands, where now he thought to see a hazy, floating pall of dust.\r\n\r\n\"Until we know their purpose and their temper we must have care. We\r\nmust hide ourselves and wait. Come, then, quickly! And prepare your\r\nguns against the need of battle!\"\r\n\r\nHis words aroused and heartened his exhausted men. The prospect even\r\nof war was welcome--anything in place of this unending trek through\r\nthe burned wilderness.\r\n\r\nZangamon cried: \"Where be those that come, O Kromno? And what manner\r\nof men?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yonder,\" indicated Stern. \"I know not who, save that they be men.\r\nWait but a little and you shall know. Now to the ravine!\"\r\n\r\nAll got up, and with more energy than they had shown for some time,\r\nthey trailed to the gully. Here they were soon well entrenched, with\r\nweapons ready. Stern now felt confident of the situation, however it\r\nmight turn.\r\n\r\nThey waited. Some little talk trickled up and down the line, but for\r\nthe most part the men kept quiet, watching eagerly.\r\n\r\nNow already the dust of the advancing column had grown unmistakably\r\nvisible, drifting downwind in a thin haze that ever advanced more and\r\nmore to the southeast, came nearer always, and rose higher in their\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\"Be ready, men,\" cautioned Stern. \"In a few minutes, now, the foremost\r\nwill pass over that blackened hilltop there ahead of us!\"\r\n\r\nHigher and thicker grew the dust. A far, shrill cry sounded; and some\r\nminutes later the breaking of wood became audible as the column cut\r\nthrough a charred barrier.\r\n\r\nStern was half standing, half lying in the arroyo, only his head\r\nprojecting over a charcoal mass that once had been a date-palm.\r\n\r\nHis weapon hung, well balanced, in his hand. All along the edge of the\r\ngully other pistol and rifle barrels were poked through debris.\r\nForgotten now were sore and wounded feet, thirst, hunger, ophthalmia,\r\ndiscouragement--everything. This new excitement had wiped all pain\r\naway.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Allan started, and a little nervous thrill ran down his\r\nspine. Over the top of the hill they all were watching a moving object\r\nhad suddenly become visible--a head!\r\n\r\nAnother followed, and then a third, and many more; and now the\r\nshoulders and the bodies had begun to show; and now the whole advance\r\nguard of the mysterious marching column was plainly to be seen, not\r\nmore than a quarter-mile away.\r\n\r\nAllan jerked the binoculars to his eyes, and for a long moment peered\r\nthrough them.\r\n\r\nHis eyes widened. An expression of blank amazement, supreme wonder and\r\nvast incredulity overspread his face.\r\n\r\n\"_What?_\" he exclaimed. \"But--it's impossible! I--it _can't_ be--\"\r\n\r\nAgain he looked, and this time was forced to believe what seemed to\r\nhim beyond all bounds of possibility.\r\n\r\n\"_Our own people! The Folk!_\" he cried in a loud voice. And before his\r\nmen could sense it he was out of the ravine.\r\n\r\nHis first thought was a relief expedition from Settlement Cliffs; but\r\nhow could there be so many? Those who had remained at the colony were\r\nonly twenty-five, all told, and in this long line that still at a good\r\npace was defiling down the hillside already more than fifty had come\r\nto view, with more and ever more still topping the rise.\r\n\r\nUtterly at a loss though he was, incapable of seeing any clue to the\r\ntremendous riddle, he still retained enough wit to hail the column,\r\nnow passing down the slope some three or four hundred yards to\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\n\"Ohe, Merucaan v'yolku!\" he shouted between hollowed palms. \"Yomnu!\r\nTroin iska ieri!\"\r\n\r\nAlready his men had scrambled from concealment, and were waving hands\r\nand weapons, cloaks, burned brush wood, anything they could lay hands\r\non, to attract attention. Their shouts and hails drowned out the\r\nmaster's.\r\n\r\nBut the meaning of the words mattered little. For the column on the\r\nhillside, understanding, had stopped short in its tracks.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, with yells, it dissolved into confusion of its\r\ncomponent parts; and at a run the People of the Abyss swarmed to the\r\ngreeting of their kinsmen and their own, the colonists.\r\n\r\nBarbarians as the folk still were, they met with a vociferous\r\naffection. A regular tangi, or joy-wailing, followed, and all\r\ncrowded vociferously about Stern, with hails of \"Kromno! Long live\r\nour Kromno, our great chief!\" in their own speech.\r\n\r\nBut Allan, dumfounded by this incredible happening, broke the ceremony\r\nas short as possible. The sight of these unexpected reenforcements\r\ndazed him. He managed to keep some coherence of thought, however, and\r\nflung rapid questions, to which he got scant answers.\r\n\r\nAmazed, he stared at the newcomers, now shouting with their relatives\r\nfrom the colony in wild abandon. To his vast astonishment he saw that\r\nthey had contrived eye-shields similar to those of his own party, and\r\nthat they had likewise painted their faces.\r\n\r\nThey had supplies as well-dried fish, seaweed, crated waterfowl, and\r\neven fresh game. Allan's astonishment knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nHe laid a compelling hand on the shoulder of one, Rigvin, whom he\r\nremembered as a mighty caster of the nets on the Great Sunken Sea.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Rigvin!\" he commanded. \"Come aside with me. I must have speech at\r\nonce!\"\r\n\r\n\"I come, O Kromno. Speak, and I make answer!\"\r\n\r\n\"How came ye here without the flying boat? How did ye escape from the\r\nAbyss? Whither went ye? Tell me all!\"\r\n\r\n\"We waited, Kromno, but you came not. Did you forget your people in\r\nthe darkness?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Rigvin. There has been great distress in Settlement Cliffs. The\r\nflying boat is lost. Even now we seek it. Enemies attacked. We\r\ndestroyed them, but had to sweep the world with fire, as ye see. Many\r\nthings have happened to keep me from my people. But how came ye here?\r\nHow have ye done this strange thing, always deemed impossible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Harken, master, that I may tell it in few words! Later, when we reach\r\nthe colony whereof you have spoken, we can make all things clear; but\r\nnow is no time for a great talking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on quickly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yea, I speak. We waited for you many days, O Kromno; but you came not\r\nagain. Days on days we waited, as you measure time. Sleepings and\r\nwakings we waited eagerly, but no sign of you was seen. Then\r\nuneasiness and fear and sorrow fell upon us all.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"We held a great charweg there at the Place of Bones, near the\r\nBlazing Well, to take thought what was best to do. For you were our\r\nchief; and our very ancient law commands that if any chief be in\r\ndistress, or deemed lost, the Folk must risk all, even life, to save\r\nand bring him once more to his own.\r\n\r\n\"For many hours our wisest men spoke. Some declared you had deserted\r\nus, but them the Folk cried down; and barely they escaped the boiling\r\nvat. We agreed some calamity had befallen. Then we swore to go to\r\nrescue you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye did?\" exclaimed Stern, much moved. \"Gods, what devotion! But--how\r\ndid ye ever get out of the Abyss? How find your way so straight toward\r\nSettlement Cliffs?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a strange story, and very long, O Kromno! All our elders took\r\nthought of what ye had told us so often, and they made a picture of\r\nthe way. We fashioned protections for the eyes and skin, as ye had\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Then the wise men recalled all the ancient traditions, which we had\r\nlong deemed myths. They looked, also, upon certain records graven in\r\nthe rock beyond the walls, past the place of burial. They decided the\r\nway might still be open past the Great Vortex and through the long\r\ncleft, whereby our distant fathers came.\r\n\r\n\"But they said it might mean death to try to pass the Vortex. They\r\nforced none to go. Only such as would need try.\"\r\n\r\n\"A volunteer expedition, eh?\" thought Allan. \"And look at the size of\r\nit, will you? These people are without even the slightest\r\nunderstanding of fear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus it was arranged, master,\" continued Rigvin. \"Eight score and\r\nmore of us offered to go. All things were quickly made ready, and much\r\nfood was packed, and many weapons. In fifteen long canoes we started,\r\nafter a great singing. Men went in each canoe to bring back the\r\nboats--\"\r\n\r\n\"They didn't even wait for you? But if ye had been lost, and sought to\r\nreturn, what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was to be no return, master. All swore either to find you or\r\ndie!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on!\" exclaimed Allan, deeply moved.\r\n\r\n\"We sailed across the Sunken Sea, O Kromno, and reached the islands of\r\nthe Lanskaarn. There we had to fight and thirty were killed. But we\r\nkept on, and in two days, watching for the quiet time between the\r\ngreat tempests, entered the Vortex.\"\r\n\r\n\"You all got through?\"\r\n\r\n\"No master. There was not time. Many were lost; but still we kept on.\r\nThen on the fourth day we reached the great cleft, even as our\r\ntraditions said. And here we camped, and sang again, and once more\r\nswore to find you. Then the boats all returned, and we pushed forward,\r\nupward, through the cleft.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\nRigvin shook his head and sighed.\r\n\r\n\"O Kromno,\" he answered, \"the story is too long! We be weary, and\r\nwould reach the place whereof ye have told us. Later there will be\r\ntime for talk. But now we cannot tell it all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye speak truth, Rigvin!\" he exclaimed. \"I, too, have many things to\r\ntell. It cannot be this day. We will lead ye to the colony. We, too,\r\nneed rest. My men are in sore straits, as ye see!\"\r\n\r\nHe gestured at the groups gathered along the edge of the ravine. A\r\ngreat noise of talking rose against the heated air; and food and\r\nwater, too, were being given to the Settlement men by the newcomers.\r\n\r\nStern knew the day was saved. Deep gratitude upwelled in his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing that I can ever do will repay men like these!\" thought he.\r\nThen, all at once, a sudden hope thrilled him, and he cried:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Rigvin, one thing more! Tell me, in your long journey from the\r\nbrink, have ye chanced to see a cleft mountain with two peaks on\r\neither hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean, master--\"\r\n\r\n\"A mountain; a high jut of land, with two tops, side by side--like two\r\ngrave-mounds?\"\r\n\r\nRigvin stood a moment in thought, his soot-smeared brows wrinkled with\r\nthe effort of trying to remember. Then all at once he looked up\r\nquickly with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Yea, master!\" he cried. \"We saw such!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where, where? For God's sake, where was it?\" ejaculated Stern,\r\ngripping him by the arm with a hand that shook with sudden keen\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n\"Where was it, master? Thus one day's marching.\"\r\n\r\nRigvin wheeled and pointed to northwestward.\r\n\r\n\"And ye can find it again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly, yes. Why, master?\"\r\n\r\n\"There, near that mountain, lies the wreck of the vlyn b'hotu, the\r\nflying boat, Rigvin! Lead us thither! We must find it. And then\r\nSettlement Cliffs!\"\r\n\r\nThrough all his exhaustion and his pain he knew that now the goal was\r\nclose at hand. And beyond toil, suffering and hardship once more\r\nbeckoned prosperity and peace and love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nFIVE YEARS LATER\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before daybreak that morning, the thriving village of\r\nSettlement Cliffs, capital and market-town of the New Hope Colony, was\r\nawake and astir.\r\n\r\nFor the great festival day was at hand, the fifth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the colony, to be celebrated by the arrival of the last\r\nMerucaans from the depths of the Abyss.\r\n\r\nThe old caves, now abandoned save for grain, fruit and fish\r\nstorehouses were closed and silent. No labor was going forward there.\r\nThe nets hung dry. From the forges, smithies and work-shops along the\r\nriver-bank at the rapids arose no sounds of the accustomed industry.\r\n\r\nThe road and bridge-builders were idle; and from the farms now dotting\r\nthe rich brule across the river--each snug stone house, tiled\r\nwith red or green, standing among its crops and growing orchards--the\r\nFolk were coming in to town for the feast-day.\r\n\r\nThe broad wooden trestle-bridge across the New Hope echoed with hollow\r\nverberations beneath the measured tread of two and four-ox teams\r\nhauling creaking wains heaped high with meats, fruits, casks of cider,\r\ngenerous wines, and all the richness of that virgin soil.\r\n\r\nOn the summer morning air rose laughter from the youths and maidens\r\ncoming in afoot. Sounded the cries of the teamsters, the barking of\r\ndogs, the mingled murmur of speech--English speech again; and the\r\nfresh wind, bearing away a fine, golden dust from the long roads,\r\nswayed the palm-tops and the fern-trees with a gentle and caressing\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\nAll up and down the broad, well-paved street of the village--a street\r\nlined with stone cottages, bordered with luxuriant tropic gardens, and\r\nbranching into a dozen smaller thoroughfares--a happy throng was\r\nidling.\r\n\r\nWell clad in plain yet substantial weaves from the vine-festooned\r\nwork-shops below the cliff, abundantly fed, vigorous and strong, not\r\none showed sickness or deformity, such as had scourged the human race\r\nin the old, evil days of long ago.\r\n\r\nLoose-belted garb, sandals and a complete absence of hats all had\r\ntheir part in this abounding health. Open-air life and rational food\r\ncompleted the work.\r\n\r\nNo drugs, save three or four essential ones, and no poisons, ever had\r\ncrept in to menace life. Wine there was, rich and unfermented; but the\r\ncurse of alcohol existed not. And in the Law it was forever banned.\r\n\r\nOn the broad porch of their home, a boulder-built cottage facing the\r\nbroad plaza where palms shaded the graveled paths, and purple, yellow\r\nand scarlet blooms lured humming-birds and butterflies, stood Beatrice\r\nand Allan.\r\n\r\nBoth were smiling in the clear June sunlight of that early morning. A\r\ncradle rocked by Gesafam--a little older and more bent, yet still\r\nhardy--gave glimpses of another olive-branch, this one a girl.\r\n\r\nThe piazza was littered at its farthest end with serviceable,\r\nhome-made playthings; but Allan, Junior, had no use for them to-day.\r\nOut there on the lawn of the plaza he was rolling and running with a\r\ntroop of other children--many, many children, indeed.\r\n\r\nAs Beatrice and Allan watched the play they smiled; and through the\r\nman's arm crept the woman's hand, and with the confidence of perfect\r\ntrust she leaned her head against his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever could have thought,\" said he at last, \"that all this really\r\ncould come true? In those dark hours when the Horde had all but\r\nswallowed us, when we fell into the Abyss, when those terrible\r\nadventures racked our souls down beside the Sunken Sea, and later,\r\nhere, when everything seemed lost--who could have foreseen _this?_\"\r\n\r\n\"You could and did!\" she answered. \"From the beginning you planned\r\neverything, Allan. It was all foreseen and nothing ever stopped you,\r\njust as the future beyond this time is all foreseen by you and must\r\nand shall be as you plan it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall be, with your help!\" he murmured, and silence came again.\r\nTogether they watched the holiday crowd gradually congregating in the\r\nvast plaza where once the palisade had been. Now the old wooden\r\nstockade had long vanished. Cleared land and farms extended far beyond\r\neven Newport Heights, where the Pauillac had first come to earth at\r\nNew Hope.\r\n\r\nWell-kept roads connected them all with the settlement. And for some\r\nmiles to southward the primeval forests had been vanquished by the\r\never-extending hand of this new, swiftly growing race.\r\n\r\n\"With my help and theirs!\" she rejoined presently. \"Never forget,\r\ndear, how wonderfully they've taken hold, how they've labored,\r\ndeveloped and grown in every way. You'd be surprised--really you\r\nwould--if you came in contact with them as I do in the schools, to see\r\nthe marvelous way they learn--old and young alike. It's a miracle,\r\nthat's all!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not exactly,\" he explained. \"It's atavism. These people of ours\r\nwere really civilized in essence, despite all the overlying ages of\r\nbarbarism. Civilization was latent in them, that's all. Just as all\r\nthe children born here under normal conditions have reverted to\r\npigmented skin and hair and eyes, so even the grown-ups have thrown\r\nback to civilization. Two or three years at the outside have put back\r\nthe coloring matter in every newcomer's iris and epidermis. Just so--\"\r\n\r\nA sudden and quickly-growing tumult in the plaza and down the long,\r\nbroad street interrupted him. He saw a waving of hands, a general\r\ncraning of necks, a drift toward the north side of the square, the\r\nriver side.\r\n\r\nThe shouts and cheers increased and cries of \"_They come! They come!_\"\r\nrose on the morning air.\r\n\r\n\"Already?\" exclaimed Allan in surprise. \"These new machines certainly\r\ndo surprise me with their speed and power. In the old days the\r\nPauillac wouldn't have been here before noon from the Abyss!\"\r\n\r\nTogether, Beatrice and he walked round the wide piazza to the rear of\r\nthe bungalow. The home estate sloped gently down toward the cement and\r\nboulder wall edging the cliff. In its broad garden stood the stable,\r\nwhere half a dozen horses--caught on the northern savannas and\r\ncarefully tamed--disputed their master's favor with the touring car he\r\nhad built up from half a dozen partly ruined machines in Atlanta and\r\nother cities.\r\n\r\nUp the cliff still roared the thunder of the rapids, to-day untamed by\r\nthe many turbines and power-plants along the shore. But louder than\r\nthe river rose the tumult of the rejoicing throng: \"They come! They\r\ncome!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" questioned Beta. \"See them, boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"There! Look! How swift! My trained men can outfly _me_ now--more luck\r\nto them!\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed far to northwestward, over the wide and rolling sea of\r\ngreen, farm-dotted, that had sprung up with marvelous fecundity in the\r\nwake of the great fire.\r\n\r\nLooking now out over the very same country where, five years and a\r\nmonth before, she had strained her tear-blinded eyes for some sign of\r\nAllan's return, Beatrice suddenly beheld three high, swift little\r\nspecks skimming up the heavens with incredible velocity.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Allan boyishly. \"Here they come--the last of my\r\nFolk!\"\r\n\r\nHe ran to the corner of the piazza and on the tall staff that\r\ndominated the canyon and the river-valley dipped the stars and stripes\r\nthree times in signal of welcome.\r\n\r\nAnd already, ere the salute was done, the rushing planes had slipped\r\nfull half the distance from the place where they had first been\r\nsighted.\r\n\r\nA messenger ran down the gravel driveway and saluted.\r\n\r\n\"O Kromno!\" he began. \"Master--\"\r\n\r\n\"Master no longer!\" Allan interrupted. \"Brother now, only!\"\r\n\r\nThe lad stared, amazed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it?\" smiled Allan.\r\n\r\n\"The Council of the Elders prays you to come to help greet the\r\nlast-comers. And after that the feast!\"\r\n\r\n\"I come!\" he answered. The lad bowed and vanished.\r\n\r\n\"They aren't going to let me out of it, after all,\" he sighed. \"I'd so\r\nmuch rather let them run their own festival to-day. But no--they've\r\ngot to ring me in, as usual! You'll come, too, of course?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded, and a moment later they were walking over the fine lawn\r\ntoward the plaza.\r\n\r\nOn the far side, in a wide, open stretch that served the children\r\nsometimes as a playground, stood the great hangars of the community's\r\nair-fleet. Beyond them rose workshops, their machinery driven by\r\nelectric power from the turbines at the rapids.\r\n\r\nEven as Allan and Beatrice passed through the cheering crowd, now\r\ndrifting toward the hangars, a sound of music wafted down-wind--a\r\nlittle harsh at times, but still with promise of far better things to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nMany flags fluttered in the air, and even the rollicking children on\r\nthe lawns paused to wonder as swift shadows cut across the park.\r\n\r\nOn high was heard the droning hum of the propellers. It ceased, and in\r\nwide, sure, evenly balanced spirals the great planes one by one slid\r\ndown and took the earth as easily as a gull sinks to rest upon the\r\nbosom of a quiet sea.\r\n\r\n\"They _do_ work well, my equilibrators!\" murmured Allan, unable to\r\nsuppress a thrill of pride. \"Simple, too; but, after all, how\r\nwonderfully effective!\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd parted to let him through with Beatrice. Two minutes later\r\nhe was clasping the hands of the last Folk ever to be brought from the\r\nstrange, buried village under the cliff beside the Sunless Sea.\r\n\r\nHe summoned Zangamon and Frumuos, together with Sivad and the three\r\naviators.\r\n\r\n\"Well done!\" said he; and that was all--all, yet enough. Then, while\r\nthe people cheered again and, crowding round, greeted their kinsfolk,\r\nhe gave orders for the housing and the care of the travel-wearied\r\nnewcomers.\r\n\r\nThrough the summer air drifted slow smoke. Off on the edge of the\r\ngrove that flanked the plaza to southward the crackling of new-built\r\nfires was heard.\r\n\r\nAllan turned to Beta with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Getting ready for the barbecue already!\" said he, \"With that and the\r\ngames and all, they ought to have enough to keep them busy for one\r\nday. Don't you think they'll have to let us go a while? There are\r\nstill a few finishing touches to put to the new laws I'm going to hand\r\nthe Council this afternoon for the Folk to hear. Yes, by all means,\r\nthey'll have to let us go.\"\r\n\r\nTogether they walked back to their bungalow amid its gardens of\r\npalm-growths, ferns and flowers. Here they stopped a moment\r\nto chat with some good friend, there to watch the children\r\nand--parentlike--make sure young Allan was safe and only normally\r\ndirty and grass-stained.\r\n\r\nThey gained their broad piazza at length, turned, and for a while\r\nwatched the busy, happy scene in the shaded street, the plaza and the\r\nplayground.\r\n\r\nThen Beta sat down by the cradle--still in that same low chair Allan\r\nhad built for her five years ago, a chair she had steadily refused to\r\nbarter for a finer one.\r\n\r\nHe drew up another beside her. From his pocket he drew a paper--the\r\nnew laws--and for a minute studied it with bent brows.\r\n\r\nThe soft wind stirred the woman's hair as she sat there half dreaming,\r\nher blue-gray eyes, a little moist, seeing far more than just what lay\r\nbefore them. On his head a shaft of sunlight fell, and had you looked\r\nyou might have seen the crisp, black hair none too sparingly lined\r\nwith gray.\r\n\r\nBut his gaze was strong and level and his smile the same as in bygone\r\nyears, as with his left hand he pressed hers and, with a look eloquent\r\nof many things, said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, sweetheart, if you're quite ready--?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND ROSES\r\n\r\n\r\nAllan sat writing in his library. Ten years had now slipped\r\npast since the last of the Folk had been brought to the surface and\r\nthe ancient settlement in the bowels of the earth forever abandoned.\r\nHeavily sprinkled with gray, the man's hair showed the stress of time\r\nand labors incredible.\r\n\r\nLines marked his face with the record of their character-building,\r\neven as his rapid pen traced on white paper the all but completing\r\nhistory of the new world whereat he had been laboring so long.\r\n\r\nThrough the open window, where the midsummer breeze swayed the silken\r\ncurtains, drifted a hum from the long file of bee-hives in the garden.\r\nFarther away sounded the comfortable gossip of hens as they breasted\r\ntheir soft feathers into the dust-baths behind the stables. A dog\r\nbarked.\r\n\r\nCame voices from without. Along the street growled a motor. Laughter\r\nof children echoed from the playground. Allan ceased writing a moment,\r\nwith a smile, and gazed about him as though waking from a dream.\r\n\r\n\"Can this be true?\" he murmured. \"After having worked over the records\r\nof the earlier time _they_ still seem the reality and this the dream!\"\r\n\r\nOn the garden-path sounded footfalls. Then the voice of Beatrice\r\ncalling:\r\n\r\n\"Come out, boy! See my new roses--just opened this morning!\"\r\n\r\nHe got up and went to the window. She--matronly now and of ampler\r\nbosom, yet still very beautiful to look upon--was standing there by\r\nthe rose-tree, scissors in hand.\r\n\r\nAllan, Junior, now a rugged, hardy-looking chap of nearly\r\nsixteen--tall, well built and with his father's peculiar alertness of\r\nbearing--was bending down a high branch for his mother.\r\n\r\nBeyond, on the lawn, the ten-year-old daughter, Frances, had young\r\nHarold in charge, swinging him high in a stout hammock under the\r\napple-trees.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you come out a minute, dear?\" asked Beatrice imploringly. \"Let\r\nyour work go for once! Surely these new roses are worth more than a\r\nhundred pages of dry statistics that nobody'll ever read, anyhow!\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed merrily, threw her a kiss, and answered:\r\n\r\n\"Still a girl, I see! Ah, well, don't tempt me, Beta. It's hard enough\r\nto work on such a day, anyhow, without your trying to entice me out!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Won't_ you come, Allan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just give me half an hour more and I'll call it off for to-day!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right; but make it a short half-hour, boy!\"\r\n\r\nHe returned to his desk. The library, like the whole house now, was\r\nfully and beautifully furnished. The spoils of twenty cities had\r\ncontributed to the adornment of \"The Nest,\" as they had christened\r\ntheir home.\r\n\r\nIn time Allan planned even to bring art-works from Europe to grace it\r\nstill further. As yet he had not attempted to cross the Atlantic, but\r\nin his seaport near the ruins of Mobile a powerful one hundred and\r\nfifty-foot motor-yacht was building.\r\n\r\nIn less than six months he counted on making the first voyage of\r\ndiscovery to the Old World.\r\n\r\nContentedly he glanced around the familiar room. Upon the mantel over\r\nthe capacious fireplace stood rare and beautiful bronzes. Priceless\r\nrugs adorned the polished floor.\r\n\r\nThe broad windows admitted floods of sunlight that fell across the\r\ngreat jars of flowers Beta always kept there for him and lighted up\r\nthe heavy tiers of books in their mahogany cases. Books\r\neverywhere--under the window-seats, up the walls, even lining a deep\r\nalcove in the far corner. Books, hundreds upon hundreds, precious and\r\ncherished above all else.\r\n\r\n\"Who ever would have thought, after all,\" murmured he, \"that we'd find\r\nbooks intact as we did? A miracle--nothing less! With our\r\nprinting-plant already at work under the cliff, all the art, science\r\nand literature of the ages--all that's worth preserving--can be still\r\nkept for mankind. But if I hadn't happened to find a library of books\r\nin a New York bonded warehouse all cased up for transportation, the\r\nwork of preservation would have been forever impossible!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned back to his history, and before writing again idly thumbed\r\nover a few pages of his voluminous manuscript. He read:\r\n\r\n\"March 1, A. D. 2930. The astronomical observatory on Round Top Hill,\r\none mile south of Newport Heights, was finished to-day and the last of\r\nthe apparatus from Cambridge, Lick, and other ruins was installed. I\r\nfind my data for reckoning time are unreliable, and have therefore\r\nassumed this date arbitrarily and readjusted the calendar accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"Our Daily Messenger, circulating through the entire community and\r\neducating the people both in English and in scientific thought, will\r\nsoon popularize the new date.\r\n\r\n\"Just as I have substituted the metric system for the old-time chaotic\r\nhodge-podge we once used, so I shall substitute English for Merucaan\r\ndefinitely inside of a few years. Already the younger generation\r\nhardly understands the native Merucaan speech. It will eventually\r\nbecome a dead, historically interesting language, like all other\r\nformer tongues. The catastrophe has rendered possible, as nothing else\r\ncould have done, the realization of universal speech, labor-unit\r\nexchange values in place of money, and a political and economic\r\ndemocracy unhampered by ideas of selfish, personal gain.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned a few pages, his face glowing with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"April 15--The first ten-yearly census was completed to-day. Even with\r\nthe aid of Frumuos and Zangamon, I have been at work on this nearly\r\ntwo months, for now our outlying farms, villages and settlements have\r\npushed away fifteen or twenty miles from the original focus at the\r\nCliffs, or 'Cliffton,' as the capital is becoming generally known.\r\n\r\n\"Population, 5,072, indicating a high birth-rate and an exceptionally\r\nlow mortality. Our one greatest need is large families. With the whole\r\nworld to reconquer, we must have men.\r\n\r\n\"Area now under cultivation, under grazing and under forests being\r\nactively exploited, 42,076 acres. Domestic animals, 26,011. Horses are\r\nalready being replaced by motors, save for pleasure-riding.\r\nPower-plants and manufacturing establishments, 32. Aerial fleet, 17 of\r\nthe large biplanes, 8 of the swifter monoplanes for scout work. One\r\nshipyard at Mobile.\r\n\r\n\"Total roads, macadamized and other, 832 miles. Air-motors and\r\nsun-motors in use or under construction, 41; mines being worked, 13;\r\nschools, 27, including the technical school at Intervale, under my\r\npersonal instruction. Military force, zero--praise be! Likewise jails,\r\nsaloons, penitentiaries, gallows, hospitals, vagrants, prostitutes,\r\npoliticians, diseases, beggars, charities--all zero, now and forever!\"\r\n\r\nAllan turned to the unfinished end of the manuscript, poised his pen a\r\nmoment, and then began writing once more where he had left off when\r\ncalled by Beatrice:\r\n\r\n\"The great monument in memory of the patriarch, first of all our\r\npeople to perish in the upper world, was finished on June 18. Memorial\r\nexercises will be held next month.\r\n\r\n\"On June 22 the new satellite, which passes darkly among the stars\r\nevery forty-eight hours, was named Discus. Its distance is 3,246\r\nmiles; dimensions, 720 miles by 432; weight, six and three-quarter\r\nbillion tons.\r\n\r\n\"On July 2, I discovered unmistakable traces either of habitations or\r\nof their ruins on the new and till now unobserved face of the moon,\r\nhidden in the old days. This problem still remains for further\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\"July 4, our national holiday, a viva-voce election and Council of\r\nthe Elders was held. They still insist on choosing me as Kromno. I\r\nweary of the task, and would gladly give it over to some younger man.\r\n\r\n\"At this Council, held on the great meeting-ground beyond the hangars,\r\nI again and for the third time submitted the question of trying to\r\ncolonize from the races still in the Abyss. If feasible, this would\r\nrapidly add to our population. The Folk are now civilized to a point\r\nwhere they could rapidly assimilate outside stock.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to the Lanskaarn, a strong and active race known to exist\r\non the Central Island in the Sunken Sea, there remain persistent\r\ntraditions of a strange, yellow-haired race somewhere on the western\r\ncoasts of that sea, beyond the Great Vortex. Two parties exist among\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"The minority is anxious for exploration and conquest. The majority\r\nvotes for peace and quiet growth. It may well be that the Lanskaarn\r\nand the other people never will be rescued. I, for one, cannot attempt\r\nit. I grow a little weary. But if the younger generation so decides,\r\nthat must be their problem and their labor, like the rebuilding of the\r\ngreat cities and the reconquest of the entire continent from sea to\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\"In the mean time--\"\r\n\r\nAt the window appeared Beatrice. Smiling, she flung a yellow rose. It\r\nlanded on Allan's desk, spilling its petals all across his manuscript.\r\n\r\nHe looked up, startled. His frown became a smile.\r\n\r\n\"My time's up?\" he queried. \"Why, I didn't know I'd been working five\r\nminutes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Up? Long ago! Now, Allan, you just simply _must_ leave that history\r\nand come out and see my roses, or--or--\"\r\n\r\n\"No threats!\" he implored with mock earnestness. \"I'm coming, dearest.\r\nJust give me time--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not another minute, do you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"--to put my work away, and I'm with you!\"\r\n\r\nHe carefully arranged the pages of his manuscript in order, while she\r\nstood waiting at the window, daring not leave lest he plunge back\r\nagain into his absorbing toil.\r\n\r\nInto his desk-drawer he slid the precious record of the community's\r\nlabor, growth, achievement, triumph. Then, with a boyish twinkle in\r\nhis eyes, he left the library.\r\n\r\nShe turned, expecting him to meet her by the broad piazza; but all at\r\nonce he stole quietly round the other corner of the bungalow, his\r\nfootsteps noiseless in the thick grass.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he seized her, unsuspecting, in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"My prisoner!\" he laughed. \"Roses? Here's the most beautiful one in\r\nour whole garden!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" she asked, not understanding.\r\n\r\n\"This red one, here!\"\r\n\r\nAnd full upon the mouth he kissed her in the leaf-shaded sunshine of\r\nthat wondrous summer day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE AFTERGLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nEvening!\r\n\r\nFar in the west, beyond the canyon of the New Hope River--now a\r\nbeautifully terraced park and pleasure-ground--the rolling hills,\r\nfertile and farm-covered, lay resting as the sun died in a glory of\r\ncrimson, gold and green.\r\n\r\nThe reflections of the passing day spread a purple haze through the\r\npalm and fern-tree aisles of the woodland. Only a slight breeze swayed\r\nthe branches. Infinite in its serenity brooded a vast peace from the\r\nglowing sky.\r\n\r\nA few questing swallows shot here and there like arrows, blackly\r\noutlined with swift and crooked wing against the vermilion of the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nOver the countryside, the distant farms and hills, a thin and rosy\r\nvapor hovered, fading slowly as the sun sank lower still.\r\n\r\nScarcely moved by the summer breeze, a few slow clouds drifted\r\naway--away to westward--gently and calmly as the first promises of\r\nnight stole up the world.\r\n\r\nAn arbor, bowered with wistarias and the waxen spikes of the new\r\nfleur de vie, stood near the woodbine-covered wall edging the cliff.\r\nAmong its leaves the soft air rustled very lovingly. A scent of many\r\nblossoms hung over the perfumed evening.\r\n\r\nUpon the lawn one last, belated robin still lingered. Its mate called\r\nfrom a sycamore beyond the hedge, and with an answering note it rose\r\nand winged away; it vanished from the sight.\r\n\r\nAllan and Beatrice, watching it from the arbor, smiled; and through\r\nthe smile it seemed there might be still a trace of deeper thought.\r\n\r\n\"How quickly it obeyed the call of love!\" said Allan musingly. \"When\r\n_that_ comes what matters else?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered presently. \"That call is still supreme. Our\r\nFrances--\"\r\n\r\nShe paused, but her eyes sought the half-glimpsed outlines of another\r\ncottage there beyond the hedge.\r\n\r\n\"We never realized, did we?\" said Allan, voicing her thought. \"It came\r\nso suddenly. But we haven't lost her, after all. And there are still\r\nthe others, too. And when grandchildren come--\"\r\n\r\n\"That means a kind of youth all over again, doesn't it? Well--\"\r\n\r\nHer hand stole into his, and for a while they sat in silence, thinking\r\nthe thoughts that \"do sometime lie too deep for tears.\"\r\n\r\nThe flaming red in the west had faded now to orange and dull umber.\r\nHigher in the sky yellows and greens gave place to blue as deep as\r\nthat in the Aegean grottos. The zenith, a dark purple, began to show a\r\nsilver twinkle here and there of stars.\r\n\r\nA whirring, roaring sound grew audible to eastward. It strengthened\r\nquickly. And all at once, far above the river, a long, swift train,\r\nits windows already lighted, sped with a smooth, rapid flight.\r\n\r\nAllan watched the monorail vanish beyond the huge north tower of the\r\ncable bridge, sink through the trees, and finally fade into the\r\ngathering gloom.\r\n\r\n\"The Great Lakes Express,\" said he. \"In the old days we thought\r\nseventy miles an hour something stupendous. Now two hundred is mere\r\nordinary schedule-time. Yes--something has been accomplished even now.\r\nThe greater time still to be--we can't hope to see it.\r\n\r\n\"But we can catch a glimpse of what it shall be, here and there. We\r\nmust be content to have built foundations. On them those who shall\r\ncome in the future shall raise a fairer and a mightier world than any\r\nwe have ever dreamed.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he relapsed into silence; but his arm drew round Beatrice, and\r\ntogether they sat watching the age-old yet ever-new drama of the birth\r\nof night.\r\n\r\nHalf heard, mingled with the eternal turmoil of the rapids, rose the\r\nfar purring of the giant dynamos in the power-houses below the cliff.\r\nHere, there, lights began to gleam in the city; and on the rolling\r\nfarmlands to northward, too, little winking eyes of light opened one\r\nby one, each one a home.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the man spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"More than a hundred thousand of us already!\" he exulted. \"Over a\r\ntenth of a million--and every year the growth is faster, ever faster,\r\nin swift progressions. A hundred thousand English-speaking people,\r\nBeta; a civilization already, even in a material sense, superior to\r\nthe old one that was swept away; in a spiritual, moral sense, how\r\nvastly far ahead!\r\n\r\n\"A hundred thousand! Some time, before long, it will be a million;\r\nthen two, five, twenty, a hundred, with no racial discords, no mutual\r\nantipathies, no barriers of name or blood; but for the first time a\r\nuniversal race, all sound and pure, starting right, living right,\r\nstriving toward a goal which even we cannot foresee!\r\n\r\n\"Not only shall this land be filled, but Europe, Asia, Africa and all\r\nthe islands of the Seven Seas shall know the hand of man again, and\r\nown his sovereignty, from pole to pole!\"\r\n\r\nHis clasp about Beatrice tightened; she felt his heart beat strong\r\nwith deep emotion as he spoke again:\r\n\r\n\"Already the cities are beginning to arise from their ashes of a\r\nthousand oblivious years. Already a score of thriving colonies have\r\nscattered from the capital, all yet bound to it with monorail cables,\r\nwith electric wires and with the ether-borne magic of the wireless.\r\n\r\n\"Already our boy, our son--can you imagine him really a man of thirty,\r\ndarling?--elected President on our last Council Day, guides a free\r\npeople--a people self-reliant and strong, energetic, capable,\r\ndominant.\r\n\r\n\"Already the inconceivable fertility of the earth is yielding its\r\nbounties a hundred fold; and trade-routes circle the ends of the great\r\nAbyss; and all the vast territory once the United States has begun to\r\nopen again before the magic touch of man!\r\n\r\n\"Of man--now free at last! No more slavery! No more the lash of hunger\r\ndriving men to their tasks. No more greed and grasping; no lust of\r\ngold, no bitter cry of crushed and hopeless serfdom! No buying and\r\nselling for the lure of profit; no speculating in the people's means\r\nof life; no squeezing of their blood for wealth! But free, strong\r\nlabor, gladly done. The making of useful and beautiful things,\r\nBeatrice, and their exchange for human need and service--this, and the\r\nold dream of joy in righteous toil, this is the blessing of our world\r\nto-day!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused. A little, swift-moving light upon the far horizon drew his\r\neye. It seemed a star, traveling among its sister stars that now\r\nalready had begun to twinkle palely in the darkening sky. But Allan\r\nknew its meaning.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" cried he and pointed. \"Look, Beatrice! The West Coast\r\nMail--the plane from southern California. The wireless told us it had\r\nstarted only three hours ago--and here it is already!\"\r\n\r\n\"And but for you,\" she murmured, \"none of all this could ever possibly\r\nhave been. Oh, Allan, remember that song--our song? In the days of our\r\nfirst love, there on the Hudson, remember how I sang to you:\r\n\r\n  \"Stark wie der Fels,\r\n   Tief wie das Meer,\r\n   Muss deine Liebe,\r\n   Muss deine Liebe sein?\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember! And it has been so?\"\r\n\r\nHer answer was to draw his hand up to her lips and print a kiss there,\r\nand as she laid her cheek upon it he felt it wet with tears.\r\n\r\nAnd night came; and now the wind lay dead; and upon the brooding\r\nearth, spangled with home-lights over hill and vale, the stars gazed\r\ncalmly down.\r\n\r\nThe steady, powerful droning of the power-plant rose, blent with the\r\nsoothing murmur of the rapids and the river.\r\n\r\n\"Seems like a lullaby--doesn't it, dearest?\" murmured Allan. \"You\r\nknow--it won't be long now before it's good-by and--good night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" she answered. \"We've _lived_, haven't we? Oh, Allan, no one\r\never lived, ever in all this world--lived as much as you and I have\r\nlived! Think of it all from the beginning till now. No one ever so\r\nmuch, so richly, so happily, so well!\"\r\n\r\n\"No one, darling!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, after toil, rest--rest is sweet, too. I shall be ready for it\r\nwhen it summons me. I shall go to it, content and brave and smiling.\r\nOnly--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only this I pray, just this and nothing more--that I mayn't have to\r\nstay awake, alone, after--after _you're_ sleeping, Allan!\"\r\n\r\nA long time they sat together, silent, in the sweet-scented gloom\r\nwithin the flower-girt arbor.\r\n\r\nAt last he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"The wonder and the glory of it all!\" he whispered. \"Oh, the wonder of\r\na dream, a vision come to pass, before our eyes!\r\n\r\n\"For, see! Has not the prophecy come true? What was then only a\r\nyearning and a hope, is it not now reality? Is it not now all even as\r\nwe dreamed so very, very long ago, there in our little bungalow beside\r\nthe broad, slow-moving Hudson?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is _this_ not true?\"\r\n\r\nI see a world where thrones have crumbled and where kings are dust.\r\nThe aristocracy of idleness has perished from the earth.\r\n\r\nI see a world without a slave. Man at last is free. Nature's forces\r\nhave by science been enslaved. Lightning and light, wind and wave,\r\nfrost and flame, and all the secret, subtle powers of earth and air\r\nare the tireless toilers for the human race.\r\n\r\nI see a world at peace, adorned with every form of art, with music's\r\nmyriad voices thrilled, while lips are rich with words of love and\r\ntruth--a world in which no exile sighs, no prisoner mourns; a world on\r\nwhich the gibbet's shadow does not fall; a world where labor reaps its\r\nfull reward--where work and worth go hand in hand!\r\n\r\nI see a world without the beggar's outstretched palm, the miser's\r\nheartless, stony stare, the piteous wail of want, the livid lips of\r\nlies, the cruel eyes of scorn.\r\n\r\nI see a race without disease of flesh or brain, shapely and fair, the\r\nmarried harmony of form and function; and, as I look, life lengthens,\r\njoy deepens, love canopies the earth--and over all, in the great dome,\r\nshines the eternal star of human hope!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Darkness and Dawn, by George Allan England",
