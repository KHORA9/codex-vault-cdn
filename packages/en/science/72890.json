She flits over\r\nthe scenes of Italian and English holidays, or wings her way with\r\neven less justification towards the countries of the future. She or\r\nhe.

It is lighted neither by window nor by lamp, yet it is filled\r\nwith a soft radiance. There are no apertures for ventilation, yet the\r\nair is fresh. There are no musical instruments, and yet, at the moment\r\nthat my meditation opens, this room is throbbing with melodious sounds.\r\nAn arm-chair is in the centre, by its side a reading-desk--that is\r\nall the furniture. And in the arm-chair there sits a swaddled lump of\r\nflesh--a woman, about five feet high, with a face as white as a fungus.\r\nIt is to her that the little room belongs.\r\n\r\nAn electric bell rang.\r\n\r\nThe woman touched a switch and the music was silent.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I must see who it is,\" she thought, and set her chair in\r\nmotion. The chair, like the music, was worked by machinery, and it\r\nrolled her to the other side of the room, where the bell still rang\r\nimportunately.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\" she called. Her voice was irritable, for she had been\r\ninterrupted often since the music began. She knew several thousand\r\npeople; in certain directions human intercourse had advanced enormously.\r\n\r\nBut when she listened into the receiver, her white face wrinkled into\r\nsmiles, and she said:\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Let us talk, I will isolate myself. I do not expect\r\nanything important will happen for the next five minutes--for I can\r\ngive you fully five minutes, Kuno. Then I must deliver my lecture on\r\n'Music during the Australian Period.'\"\r\n\r\nShe touched the isolation knob, so that no one else could speak to\r\nher. Then she touched the lighting apparatus, and the little room was\r\nplunged into darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Be quick!\" she called, her irritation returning. \"Be quick, Kuno; here\r\nI am in the dark wasting my time.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was fully fifteen seconds before the round plate that she\r\nheld in her hands began to glow. A faint blue light shot across it,\r\ndarkening to purple, and presently she could see the image of her son,\r\nwho lived on the other side of the earth, and he could see her.\r\n\r\n\"Kuno, how slow you are.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled gravely.\r\n\r\n\"I really believe you enjoy dawdling.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have called you before, mother, but you were always busy or\r\nisolated. I have something particular to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, dearest boy? Be quick. Why could you not send it by\r\npneumatic post?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I prefer saying such a thing. I want----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to come and see me.\"\r\n\r\nVashti watched his face in the blue plate.\r\n\r\n\"But I can see you!\" she exclaimed. \"What more do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to see you not through the Machine,\" said Kuno. \"I want to\r\nspeak to you not through the wearisome Machine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hush!\" said his mother, vaguely shocked. \"You mustn't say anything\r\nagainst the Machine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"One mustn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"You talk as if a god had made the Machine,\" cried the other. \"I\r\nbelieve that you pray to it when you are unhappy. Men made it, do not\r\nforget that. Great men, but men. The Machine is much, but it is not\r\neverything. I see something like you in this plate, but I do not see\r\nyou. I hear something like you through this telephone, but I do not\r\nhear you. That is why I want you to come. Come and stop with me. Pay\r\nme a visit, so that we can meet face to face, and talk about the hopes\r\nthat are in my mind.\"\r\n\r\nShe replied that she could scarcely spare the time for a visit.\r\n\r\n\"The air-ship barely takes two days to fly between me and you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dislike air-ships.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dislike seeing the horrible brown earth, and the sea, and the stars\r\nwhen it is dark. I get no ideas in an air-ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not get them anywhere else.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of ideas can the air give you?\"\r\n\r\nHe paused for an instant.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not know four big stars that form an oblong, and three stars\r\nclose together in the middle of the oblong, and hanging from these\r\nstars, three other stars?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I do not. I dislike the stars. But did they give you an idea? How\r\ninteresting; tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had an idea that they were like a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"The four big stars are the man's shoulders and his knees. The three\r\nstars in the middle are like the belts that men wore once, and the\r\nthree stars hanging are like a sword.\"\r\n\r\n\"A sword?\"\r\n\r\n\"Men carried swords about with them, to kill animals and other men.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not strike me as a very good idea, but it is certainly\r\noriginal. When did it come to you first?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the air-ship----\" He broke off, and she fancied that he looked\r\nsad. She could not be sure, for the Machine did not transmit _nuances_\r\nof expression. It only gave a general idea of people--an idea that\r\nwas good enough for all practical purposes, Vashti thought. The\r\nimponderable bloom, declared by a discredited philosophy to be the\r\nactual essence of intercourse, was rightly ignored by the Machine, just\r\nas the imponderable bloom of the grape was ignored by the manufacturers\r\nof artificial fruit. Something \"good enough\" had long since been\r\naccepted by our race.\r\n\r\n\"The truth is,\" he continued, \"that I want to see these stars again.\r\nThey are curious stars. I want to see them not from the air-ship, but\r\nfrom the surface of the earth, as our ancestors did, thousands of\r\nyears ago. I want to visit the surface of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nShe was shocked again.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, you must come, if only to explain to me what is the harm of\r\nvisiting the surface of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"No harm,\" she replied, controlling herself. \"But no advantage. The\r\nsurface of the earth is only dust and mud, no life remains on it, and\r\nyou would need a respirator, or the cold of the outer air would kill\r\nyou. One dies immediately in the outer air.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know; of course I shall take all precautions.\"\r\n\r\n\"And besides----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\nShe considered, and chose her words with care. Her son had a queer\r\ntemper, and she wished to dissuade him from the expedition.\r\n\r\n\"It is contrary to the spirit of the age,\" she asserted.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean by that, contrary to the Machine?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a sense, but----\"\r\n\r\nHis image in the blue plate faded.\r\n\r\n\"Kuno!\"\r\n\r\nHe had isolated himself.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Vashti felt lonely.\r\n\r\nThen she generated the light, and the sight of her room, flooded with\r\nradiance and studded with electric buttons, revived her. There were\r\nbuttons and switches everywhere--buttons to call for food, for music,\r\nfor clothing. There was the hot-bath button, by pressure of which a\r\nbasin of (imitation) marble rose out of the floor, filled to the brim\r\nwith a warm deodorised liquid. There was the cold-bath button. There\r\nwas the button that produced literature. And there were of course the\r\nbuttons by which she communicated with her friends. The room, though\r\nit contained nothing, was in touch with all that she cared for in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nVashti's next move was to turn off the isolation-switch, and all the\r\naccumulations of the last three minutes burst upon her. The room was\r\nfilled with the noise of bells, and speaking-tubes. What was the new\r\nfood like? Could she recommend it? Had she had any ideas lately? Might\r\none tell her one's own ideas? Would she make an engagement to visit the\r\npublic nurseries at an early date?--say this day month.\r\n\r\nTo most of these questions she replied with irritation--a growing\r\nquality in that accelerated age. She said that the new food was\r\nhorrible. That she could not visit the public nurseries through press\r\nof engagements. That she had no ideas of her own but had just been\r\ntold one--that four stars and three in the middle were like a man: she\r\ndoubted there was much in it. Then she switched off her correspondents,\r\nfor it was time to deliver her lecture on Australian music.\r\n\r\nThe clumsy system of public gatherings had been long since abandoned;\r\nneither Vashti nor her audience stirred from their rooms. Seated in\r\nher arm-chair she spoke, while they in their arm-chairs heard her,\r\nfairly well, and saw her, fairly well. She opened with a humorous\r\naccount of music in the pre-Mongolian epoch, and went on to describe\r\nthe great outburst of song that followed the Chinese conquest. Remote\r\nand primæval as were the methods of I-San-So and the Brisbane school,\r\nshe yet felt (she said) that study of them might repay the musician of\r\ntoday: they had freshness; they had, above all, ideas.\r\n\r\nHer lecture, which lasted ten minutes, was well received, and at its\r\nconclusion she and many of her audience listened to a lecture on the\r\nsea; there were ideas to be got from the sea; the speaker had donned a\r\nrespirator and visited it lately. Then she fed, talked to many friends,\r\nhad a bath, talked again, and summoned her bed.\r\n\r\nThe bed was not to her liking. It was too large, and she had a feeling\r\nfor a small bed. Complaint was useless, for beds were of the same\r\ndimension all over the world, and to have had an alternative size\r\nwould have involved vast alterations in the Machine. Vashti isolated\r\nherself--it was necessary, for neither day nor night existed under the\r\nground--and reviewed all that had happened since she had summoned the\r\nbed last. Ideas? Scarcely any. Events--was Kuno's invitation an event?\r\n\r\nBy her side, on the little reading-desk, was a survival from the ages\r\nof litter--one book. This was the Book of the Machine. In it were\r\ninstructions against every possible contingency. If she was hot or\r\ncold or dyspeptic or at loss for a word, she went to the book, and it\r\ntold her which button to press. The Central Committee published it. In\r\naccordance with a growing habit, it was richly bound.\r\n\r\nSitting up in the bed, she took it reverently in her hands. She glanced\r\nround the glowing room as if some one might be watching her. Then, half\r\nashamed, half joyful, she murmured \"O Machine! O Machine!\" and raised\r\nthe volume to her lips. Thrice she kissed it, thrice inclined her head,\r\nthrice she felt the delirium of acquiescence. Her ritual performed,\r\nshe turned to page 1367, which gave the times of the departure of the\r\nair-ships from the island in the southern hemisphere, under whose soil\r\nshe lived, to the island in the northern hemisphere, whereunder lived\r\nher son.\r\n\r\nShe thought, \"I have not the time.\"\r\n\r\nShe made the room dark and slept; she awoke and made the room light;\r\nshe ate and exchanged ideas with her friends, and listened to music\r\nand attended lectures; she made the room dark and slept. Above her,\r\nbeneath her, and around her, the Machine hummed eternally; she did not\r\nnotice the noise, for she had been born with it in her ears. The earth,\r\ncarrying her, hummed as it sped through silence, turning her now to the\r\ninvisible sun, now to the invisible stars. She awoke and made the room\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\"Kuno!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not talk to you,\" he answered, \"until you come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been on the surface of the earth since we spoke last?\"\r\n\r\nHis image faded.\r\n\r\nAgain she consulted the book. She became very nervous and lay back\r\nin her chair palpitating. Think of her as without teeth or hair.\r\nPresently she directed the chair to the wall, and pressed an unfamiliar\r\nbutton. The wall swung apart slowly. Through the opening she saw a\r\ntunnel that curved slightly, so that its goal was not visible. Should\r\nshe go to see her son, here was the beginning of the journey.\r\n\r\nOf course she knew all about the communication-system. There was\r\nnothing mysterious in it. She would summon a car and it would fly with\r\nher down the tunnel until it reached the lift that communicated with\r\nthe air-ship station: the system had been in use for many, many years,\r\nlong before the universal establishment of the Machine. And of course\r\nshe had studied the civilisation that had immediately preceded her\r\nown--the civilisation that had mistaken the functions of the system,\r\nand had used it for bringing people to things, instead of for bringing\r\nthings to people. Those funny old days, when men went for change of air\r\ninstead of changing the air in their rooms! And yet--she was frightened\r\nof the tunnel: she had not seen it since her last child was born. It\r\ncurved--but not quite as she remembered; it was brilliant--but not\r\nquite as brilliant as a lecturer had suggested. Vashti was seized with\r\nthe terrors of direct experience. She shrank back into the room, and\r\nthe wall closed up again.\r\n\r\n\"Kuno,\" she said, \"I cannot come to see you. I am not well.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately an enormous apparatus fell on to her out of the ceiling, a\r\nthermometer was automatically inserted between her lips, a stethoscope\r\nwas automatically laid upon her heart. She lay powerless. Cool pads\r\nsoothed her forehead. Kuno had telegraphed to her doctor.\r\n\r\nSo the human passions still blundered up and down in the Machine.\r\nVashti drank the medicine that the doctor projected into her mouth, and\r\nthe machinery retired into the ceiling. The voice of Kuno was heard\r\nasking how she felt.\r\n\r\n\"Better.\" Then with irritation: \"But why do you not come to me\r\ninstead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I cannot leave this place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, any moment, something tremendous may happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been on the surface of the earth yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not tell you through the Machine.\"\r\n\r\nShe resumed her life.\r\n\r\nBut she thought of Kuno as a baby, his birth, his removal to the public\r\nnurseries, her one visit to him there, his visits to her--visits which\r\nstopped when the Machine had assigned him a room on the other side of\r\nthe earth. \"Parents, duties of,\" said the book of the Machine, \"cease\r\nat the moment of birth. P. 422327483.\" True, but there was something\r\nspecial about Kuno--indeed there had been something special about\r\nall her children--and, after all, she must brave the journey if he\r\ndesired it. And \"something tremendous might happen.\" What did that\r\nmean? The nonsense of a youthful man, no doubt, but she must go. Again\r\nshe pressed the unfamiliar button, again the wall swung back, and she\r\nsaw the tunnel that curved out of sight. Clasping the Book, she rose,\r\ntottered on to the platform, and summoned the car. Her room closed\r\nbehind her: the journey to the northern hemisphere had begun.\r\n\r\nOf course it was perfectly easy. The car approached and in it she\r\nfound arm-chairs exactly like her own. When she signalled, it stopped,\r\nand she tottered into the lift. One other passenger was in the lift,\r\nthe first fellow creature she had seen face to face for months. Few\r\ntravelled in these days, for, thanks to the advance of science, the\r\nearth was exactly alike all over. Rapid intercourse, from which the\r\nprevious civilisation had hoped so much, had ended by defeating itself.\r\nWhat was the good of going to Pekin when it was just like Shrewsbury?\r\nWhy return to Shrewsbury when it would be just like Pekin? Men seldom\r\nmoved their bodies; all unrest was concentrated in the soul.\r\n\r\nThe air-ship service was a relic from the former age. It was kept up,\r\nbecause it was easier to keep it up than to stop it or to diminish\r\nit, but it now far exceeded the wants of the population. Vessel after\r\nvessel would rise from the vomitories of Rye or of Christchurch (I use\r\nthe antique names), would sail into the crowded sky, and would draw up\r\nat the wharves of the south--empty. So nicely adjusted was the system,\r\nso independent of meteorology, that the sky, whether calm or cloudy,\r\nresembled a vast kaleidoscope whereon the same patterns periodically\r\nrecurred. The ship on which Vashti sailed started now at sunset, now\r\nat dawn. But always, as it passed above Rheims, it would neighbour the\r\nship that served between Helsingfors and the Brazils, and, every third\r\ntime it surmounted the Alps, the fleet of Palermo would cross its track\r\nbehind. Night and day, wind and storm, tide and earthquake, impeded man\r\nno longer. He had harnessed Leviathan. All the old literature, with its\r\npraise of Nature, and its fear of Nature, rang false as the prattle of\r\na child.\r\n\r\nYet as Vashti saw the vast flank of the ship, stained with exposure\r\nto the outer air, her horror of direct experience returned. It was\r\nnot quite like the air-ship in the cinematophote. For one thing it\r\nsmelt--not strongly or unpleasantly, but it did smell, and with her\r\neyes shut she should have known that a new thing was close to her. Then\r\nshe had to walk to it from the lift, had to submit to glances from the\r\nother passengers. The man in front dropped his Book--no great matter,\r\nbut it disquieted them all. In the rooms, if the Book was dropped, the\r\nfloor raised it mechanically, but the gangway to the air-ship was not\r\nso prepared, and the sacred volume lay motionless. They stopped--the\r\nthing was unforeseen--and the man, instead of picking up his property,\r\nfelt the muscles of his arm to see how they had failed him. Then some\r\none actually said with direct utterance: \"We shall be late\"--and they\r\ntrooped on board, Vashti treading on the pages as she did so.\r\n\r\nInside, her anxiety increased. The arrangements were old-fashioned and\r\nrough. There was even a female attendant, to whom she would have to\r\nannounce her wants during the voyage. Of course a revolving platform\r\nran the length of the boat, but she was expected to walk from it to her\r\ncabin. Some cabins were better than others, and she did not get the\r\nbest. She thought the attendant had been unfair, and spasms of rage\r\nshook her. The glass valves had closed, she could not go back. She saw,\r\nat the end of the vestibule, the lift in which she had ascended going\r\nquietly up and down, empty. Beneath those corridors of shining tiles\r\nwere rooms, tier below tier, reaching far into the earth, and in each\r\nroom there sat a human being, eating, or sleeping, or producing ideas.\r\nAnd buried deep in the hive was her own room. Vashti was afraid.\r\n\r\n\"O Machine! O Machine!\" she murmured, and caressed her Book, and was\r\ncomforted.\r\n\r\nThen the sides of the vestibule seemed to melt together, as do the\r\npassages that we see in dreams, the lift vanished, the Book that had\r\nbeen dropped slid to the left and vanished, polished tiles rushed\r\nby like a stream of water, there was a slight jar, and the air-ship,\r\nissuing from its tunnel, soared above the waters of a tropical ocean.\r\n\r\nIt was night. For a moment she saw the coast of Sumatra edged by the\r\nphosphorescence of waves, and crowned by lighthouses, still sending\r\nforth their disregarded beams. These also vanished, and only the\r\nstars distracted her. They were not motionless, but swayed to and fro\r\nabove her head, thronging out of one skylight into another, as if the\r\nuniverse and not the air-ship was careening. And, as often happens on\r\nclear nights, they seemed now to be in perspective, now on a plane;\r\nnow piled tier beyond tier into the infinite heavens, now concealing\r\ninfinity, a roof limiting for ever the visions of men. In either case\r\nthey seemed intolerable. \"Are we to travel in the dark?\" called the\r\npassengers angrily, and the attendant, who had been careless, generated\r\nthe light, and pulled down the blinds of pliable metal. When the\r\nair-ships had been built, the desire to look direct at things still\r\nlingered in the world. Hence the extraordinary number of skylights and\r\nwindows, and the proportionate discomfort to those who were civilised\r\nand refined. Even in Vashti's cabin one star peeped through a flaw in\r\nthe blind, and after a few hours' uneasy slumber, she was disturbed by\r\nan unfamiliar glow, which was the dawn.\r\n\r\nQuick as the ship had sped westwards, the earth had rolled eastwards\r\nquicker still, and had dragged back Vashti and her companions towards\r\nthe sun. Science could prolong the night, but only for a little,\r\nand those high hopes of neutralising the earth's diurnal revolution\r\nhad passed, together with hopes that were possibly higher. To \"keep\r\npace with the sun,\" or even to outstrip it, had been the aim of the\r\ncivilisation preceding this. Racing aeroplanes had been built for\r\nthe purpose, capable of enormous speed, and steered by the greatest\r\nintellects of the epoch. Round the globe they went, round and round,\r\nwestward, westward, round and round, amidst humanity's applause. In\r\nvain. The globe went eastward quicker still, horrible accidents\r\noccurred, and the Committee of the Machine, at the time rising into\r\nprominence, declared the pursuit illegal, unmechanical, and punishable\r\nby Homelessness.\r\n\r\nOf Homelessness more will be said later.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the Committee was right. Yet the attempt to \"defeat the sun\"\r\naroused the last common interest that our race experienced about the\r\nheavenly bodies, or indeed about anything. It was the last time that\r\nmen were compacted by thinking of a power outside the world. The sun\r\nhad conquered, yet it was the end of his spiritual dominion. Dawn,\r\nmidday, twilight, the zodiacal path, touched neither men's lives nor\r\ntheir hearts, and science retreated into the ground, to concentrate\r\nherself upon problems that she was certain of solving.\r\n\r\nSo when Vashti found her cabin invaded by a rosy finger of light,\r\nshe was annoyed, and tried to adjust the blind. But the blind flew\r\nup altogether, and she saw through the skylight small pink clouds,\r\nswaying against a background of blue, and as the sun crept higher, its\r\nradiance entered direct, brimming down the wall, like a golden sea. It\r\nrose and fell with the air-ship's motion, just as waves rise and fall,\r\nbut it advanced steadily, as a tide advances. Unless she was careful,\r\nit would strike her face. A spasm of horror shook her and she rang\r\nfor the attendant. The attendant too was horrified, but she could do\r\nnothing; it was not her place to mend the blind. She could only suggest\r\nthat the lady should change her cabin, which she accordingly prepared\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nPeople were almost exactly alike all over the world, but the attendant\r\nof the air-ship, perhaps owing to her exceptional duties, had grown\r\na little out of the common. She had often to address passengers\r\nwith direct speech, and this had given her a certain roughness and\r\noriginality of manner. When Vashti swerved away from the sunbeams with\r\na cry, she behaved barbarically--she put out her hand to steady her.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you!\" exclaimed the passenger. \"You forget yourself!\"\r\n\r\nThe woman was confused, and apologised for not having let her fall.\r\nPeople never touched one another. The custom had become obsolete, owing\r\nto the Machine.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we now?\" asked Vashti haughtily.\r\n\r\n\"We are over Asia,\" said the attendant, anxious to be polite.\r\n\r\n\"Asia?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must excuse my common way of speaking. I have got into the habit\r\nof calling places over which I pass by their unmechanical names.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I remember Asia. The Mongols came from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beneath us, in the open air, stood a city that was once called Simla.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever heard of the Mongols and of the Brisbane school?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brisbane also stood in the open air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those mountains to the right--let me show you them.\" She pushed back\r\na metal blind. The main chain of the Himalayas was revealed. \"They were\r\nonce called the Roof of the World, those mountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a foolish name!\"\r\n\r\n\"You must remember that, before the dawn of civilisation, they seemed\r\nto be an impenetrable wall that touched the stars. It was supposed\r\nthat no one but the gods could exist above their summits. How we have\r\nadvanced, thanks to the Machine!\"\r\n\r\n\"How we have advanced, thanks to the Machine!\" said Vashti.\r\n\r\n\"How we have advanced, thanks to the Machine!\" echoed the passenger\r\nwho had dropped his Book the night before, and who was standing in the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\"And that white stuff in the cracks?--what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have forgotten its name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cover the window, please. These mountains give me no ideas.\"\r\n\r\nThe northern aspect of the Himalayas was in deep shadow: on the Indian\r\nslope the sun had just prevailed. The forests had been destroyed\r\nduring the literature epoch for the purpose of making newspaper-pulp,\r\nbut the snows were awakening to their morning glory, and clouds still\r\nhung on the breasts of Kinchinjunga. In the plain were seen the ruins\r\nof cities, with diminished rivers creeping by their walls, and by the\r\nsides of these were sometimes the signs of vomitories, marking the\r\ncities of today. Over the whole prospect air-ships rushed, crossing and\r\nintercrossing with incredible _aplomb_, and rising nonchalantly when\r\nthey desired to escape the perturbations of the lower atmosphere and to\r\ntraverse the Roof of the World.\r\n\r\n\"We have indeed advanced, thanks to the Machine,\" repeated the\r\nattendant, and hid the Himalayas behind a metal blind.\r\n\r\nThe day dragged wearily forward. The passengers sat each in his cabin,\r\navoiding one another with an almost physical repulsion and longing to\r\nbe once more under the surface of the earth. There were eight or ten of\r\nthem, mostly young males, sent out from the public nurseries to inhabit\r\nthe rooms of those who had died in various parts of the earth. The man\r\nwho had dropped his Book was on the homeward journey. He had been sent\r\nto Sumatra for the purpose of propagating the race. Vashti alone was\r\ntravelling by her private will.\r\n\r\nAt midday she took a second glance at the earth. The air-ship was\r\ncrossing another range of mountains, but she could see little, owing to\r\nclouds. Masses of black rock hovered below her, and merged indistinctly\r\ninto grey. Their shapes were fantastic; one of them resembled a\r\nprostrate man.\r\n\r\n\"No ideas here,\" murmured Vashti, and hid the Caucasus behind a metal\r\nblind.\r\n\r\nIn the evening she looked again. They were crossing a golden sea, in\r\nwhich lay many small islands and one peninsula.\r\n\r\nShe repeated, \"No ideas here,\" and hid Greece behind a metal blind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Part II_\r\n\r\n                         THE MENDING APPARATUS\r\n\r\nBy a vestibule, by a lift, by a tubular railway, by a platform, by a\r\nsliding door--by reversing all the steps of her departure did Vashti\r\narrive at her son's room, which exactly resembled her own. She might\r\nwell declare that the visit was superfluous. The buttons, the knobs,\r\nthe reading-desk with the Book, the temperature, the atmosphere, the\r\nillumination--all were exactly the same. And if Kuno himself, flesh of\r\nher flesh, stood close beside her at last, what profit was there in\r\nthat? She was too well-bred to shake him by the hand.\r\n\r\nAverting her eyes, she spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Here I am. I have had the most terrible journey and greatly retarded\r\nthe development of my soul. It is not worth it, Kuno, it is not worth\r\nit. My time is too precious. The sunlight almost touched me, and I have\r\nmet with the rudest people. I can only stop a few minutes. Say what\r\nyou want to say, and then I must return.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been threatened with Homelessness,\" said Kuno.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him now.\r\n\r\n\"I have been threatened with Homelessness, and I could not tell you\r\nsuch a thing through the Machine.\"\r\n\r\nHomelessness means death. The victim is exposed to the air, which kills\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"I have been outside since I spoke to you last. The tremendous thing\r\nhas happened, and they have discovered me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why shouldn't you go outside!\" she exclaimed. \"It is perfectly\r\nlegal, perfectly mechanical, to visit the surface of the earth. I have\r\nlately been to a lecture on the sea; there is no objection to that; one\r\nsimply summons a respirator and gets an Egression-permit. It is not the\r\nkind of thing that spiritually-minded people do, and I begged you not\r\nto do it, but there is no legal objection to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not get an Egression-permit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how did you get out?\"\r\n\r\n\"I found out a way of my own.\"\r\n\r\nThe phrase conveyed no meaning to her, and he had to repeat it.\r\n\r\n\"A way of your own?\" she whispered. \"But that would be wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\nThe question shocked her beyond measure.\r\n\r\n\"You are beginning to worship the Machine,\" he said coldly. \"You think\r\nit irreligious of me to have found out a way of my own. It was just\r\nwhat the Committee thought, when they threatened me with Homelessness.\"\r\n\r\nAt this she grew angry. \"I worship nothing!\" she cried. \"I am most\r\nadvanced. I don't think you irreligious, for there is no such thing as\r\nreligion left. All the fear and the superstition that existed once have\r\nbeen destroyed by the Machine. I only meant that to find out a way of\r\nyour own was----Besides, there is no new way out.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is always supposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except through the vomitories, for which one must have an\r\nEgression-permit, it is impossible to get out. The Book says so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the Book's wrong, for I have been out on my feet.\"\r\n\r\nFor Kuno was possessed of a certain physical strength.\r\n\r\nBy these days it was a demerit to be muscular. Each infant was\r\nexamined at birth, and all who promised undue strength were destroyed.\r\nHumanitarians may protest, but it would have been no true kindness to\r\nlet an athlete live; he would never have been happy in that state of\r\nlife to which the Machine had called him; he would have yearned for\r\ntrees to climb, rivers to bathe in, meadows and hills against which he\r\nmight measure his body. Man must be adapted to his surroundings, must\r\nhe not? In the dawn of the world our weakly must be exposed on Mount\r\nTaygetus, in its twilight our strong will suffer euthanasia, that the\r\nMachine may progress, that the Machine may progress, that the Machine\r\nmay progress eternally.\r\n\r\n\"You know that we have lost the sense of space. We say 'space is\r\nannihilated,' but we have annihilated not space, but the sense thereof.\r\nWe have lost a part of ourselves. I determined to recover it, and I\r\nbegan by walking up and down the platform of the railway outside my\r\nroom. Up and down, until I was tired, and so did recapture the meaning\r\nof 'Near' and 'Far.' 'Near' is a place to which I can get quickly _on\r\nmy feet_, not a place to which the train or the air-ship will take me\r\nquickly. 'Far' is a place to which I cannot get quickly on my feet;\r\nthe vomitory is 'far,' though I could be there in thirty-eight seconds\r\nby summoning the train. Man is the measure. That was my first lesson.\r\nMan's feet are the measure for distance, his hands are the measure\r\nfor ownership, his body is the measure for all that is lovable and\r\ndesirable and strong. Then I went further: it was then that I called to\r\nyou for the first time, and you would not come.\r\n\r\n\"This city, as you know, is built deep beneath the surface of the\r\nearth, with only the vomitories protruding. Having paced the platform\r\noutside my own room, I took the lift to the next platform and paced\r\nthat also, and so with each in turn, until I came to the topmost, above\r\nwhich begins the earth. All the platforms were exactly alike, and all\r\nthat I gained by visiting them was to develop my sense of space and\r\nmy muscles. I think I should have been content with this--it is not a\r\nlittle thing--but as I walked and brooded, it occurred to me that our\r\ncities had been built in the days when men still breathed the outer\r\nair, and that there had been ventilation shafts for the workmen. I\r\ncould think of nothing but these ventilation shafts. Had they been\r\ndestroyed by all the food-tubes and medicine-tubes and music-tubes\r\nthat the Machine has evolved lately? Or did traces of them remain? One\r\nthing was certain. If I came upon them anywhere, it would be in the\r\nrailway-tunnels of the topmost story. Everywhere else, all space was\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\n\"I am telling my story quickly, but don't think that I was not a coward\r\nor that your answers never depressed me. It is not the proper thing, it\r\nis not mechanical, it is not decent to walk along a railway-tunnel.\r\nI did not fear that I might tread upon a live rail and be killed. I\r\nfeared something far more intangible--doing what was not contemplated\r\nby the Machine. Then I said to myself, 'Man is the measure,' and I\r\nwent, and after many visits I found an opening.\r\n\r\n\"The tunnels, of course, were lighted. Everything is light, artificial\r\nlight; darkness is the exception. So when I saw a black gap in the\r\ntiles, I knew that it was an exception, and rejoiced. I put in my\r\narm--I could put in no more at first--and waved it round and round\r\nin ecstasy. I loosened another tile, and put in my head, and shouted\r\ninto the darkness: 'I am coming, I shall do it yet,' and my voice\r\nreverberated down endless passages. I seemed to hear the spirits of\r\nthose dead workmen who had returned each evening to the starlight and\r\nto their wives, and all the generations who had lived in the open air\r\ncalled back to me, 'You will do it yet, you are coming.'\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, and, absurd as he was, his last words moved her. For Kuno\r\nhad lately asked to be a father, and his request had been refused by\r\nthe Committee. His was not a type that the Machine desired to hand on.\r\n\r\n\"Then a train passed. It brushed by me, but I thrust my head and arms\r\ninto the hole. I had done enough for one day, so I crawled back to the\r\nplatform, went down in the lift, and summoned my bed. Ah, what dreams!\r\nAnd again I called you, and again you refused.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and said:\r\n\r\n\"Don't. Don't talk of these terrible things. You make me miserable. You\r\nare throwing civilisation away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I had got back the sense of space and a man cannot rest then.\r\nI determined to get in at the hole and climb the shaft. And so I\r\nexercised my arms. Day after day I went through ridiculous movements,\r\nuntil my flesh ached, and I could hang by my hands and hold the pillow\r\nof my bed outstretched for many minutes. Then I summoned a respirator,\r\nand started.\r\n\r\n\"It was easy at first. The mortar had somehow rotted, and I soon pushed\r\nsome more tiles in, and clambered after them into the darkness, and the\r\nspirits of the dead comforted me. I don't know what I mean by that.\r\nI just say what I felt. I felt, for the first time, that a protest\r\nhad been lodged against corruption, and that even as the dead were\r\ncomforting me, so I was comforting the unborn. I felt that humanity\r\nexisted, and that it existed without clothes. How can I possibly\r\nexplain this? It was naked, humanity seemed naked, and all these tubes\r\nand buttons and machineries neither came into the world with us, nor\r\nwill they follow us out, nor do they matter supremely while we are\r\nhere. Had I been strong, I would have torn off every garment I had, and\r\ngone out into the outer air unswaddled. But this is not for me, nor\r\nperhaps for my generation. I climbed with my respirator and my hygienic\r\nclothes and my dietetic tabloids! Better thus than not at all.\r\n\r\n\"There was a ladder, made of some primæval metal. The light from the\r\nrailway fell upon its lowest rungs, and I saw that it led straight\r\nupwards out of the rubble at the bottom of the shaft. Perhaps our\r\nancestors ran up and down it a dozen times daily, in their building. As\r\nI climbed, the rough edges cut through my gloves so that my hands bled.\r\nThe light helped me for a little, and then came darkness and, worse\r\nstill, silence which pierced my ears like a sword. The Machine hums!\r\nDid you know that? Its hum penetrates our blood, and may even guide our\r\nthoughts. Who knows! I was getting beyond its power. Then I thought:\r\n'This silence means that I am doing wrong.' But I heard voices in the\r\nsilence, and again they strengthened me.\" He laughed. \"I had need of\r\nthem. The next moment I cracked my head against something.\"\r\n\r\nShe sighed.\r\n\r\n\"I had reached one of those pneumatic stoppers that defend us from\r\nthe outer air. You may have noticed them on the air-ship. Pitch dark,\r\nmy feet on the rungs of an invisible ladder, my hands cut; I cannot\r\nexplain how I lived through this part, but the voices still comforted\r\nme, and I felt for fastenings. The stopper, I suppose, was about eight\r\nfeet across. I passed my hand over it as far as I could reach. It was\r\nperfectly smooth. I felt it almost to the centre. Not quite to the\r\ncentre, for my arm was too short. Then the voice said: 'Jump. It is\r\nworth it. There may be a handle in the centre, and you may catch hold\r\nof it and so come to us your own way. And if there is no handle, so\r\nthat you may fall and are dashed to pieces--it is still worth it: you\r\nwill still come to us your own way.' So I jumped. There was a handle,\r\nand----\"\r\n\r\nHe paused. Tears gathered in his mother's eyes. She knew that he was\r\nfated. If he did not die today he would die tomorrow. There was not\r\nroom for such a person in the world. And with her pity disgust mingled.\r\nShe was ashamed at having borne such a son, she who had always been so\r\nrespectable and so full of ideas. Was he really the little boy to whom\r\nshe had taught the use of his stops and buttons, and to whom she had\r\ngiven his first lessons in the Book? The very hair that disfigured his\r\nlip showed that he was reverting to some savage type. On atavism the\r\nMachine can have no mercy.\r\n\r\n\"There was a handle, and I did catch it. I hung tranced over the\r\ndarkness and heard the hum of these workings as the last whisper in\r\na dying dream. All the things I had cared about and all the people\r\nI had spoken to through tubes appeared infinitely little. Meanwhile\r\nthe handle revolved. My weight had set something in motion and I span\r\nslowly, and then----\r\n\r\n\"I cannot describe it. I was lying with my face to the sunshine. Blood\r\npoured from my nose and ears and I heard a tremendous roaring. The\r\nstopper, with me clinging to it, had simply been blown out of the\r\nearth, and the air that we make down here was escaping through the vent\r\ninto the air above. It burst up like a fountain. I crawled back to\r\nit--for the upper air hurts--and, as it were, I took great sips from\r\nthe edge. My respirator had flown goodness knows where, my clothes\r\nwere torn. I just lay with my lips close to the hole, and I sipped\r\nuntil the bleeding stopped. You can imagine nothing so curious. This\r\nhollow in the grass--I will speak of it in a minute,--the sun shining\r\ninto it, not brilliantly but through marbled clouds,--the peace, the\r\nnonchalance, the sense of space, and, brushing my cheek, the roaring\r\nfountain of our artificial air! Soon I spied my respirator, bobbing\r\nup and down in the current high above my head, and higher still were\r\nmany air-ships. But no one ever looks out of air-ships, and in my case\r\nthey could not have picked me up. There I was, stranded. The sun shone\r\na little way down the shaft, and revealed the topmost rung of the\r\nladder, but it was hopeless trying to reach it. I should either have\r\nbeen tossed up again by the escape, or else have fallen in, and died. I\r\ncould only lie on the grass, sipping and sipping, and from time to time\r\nglancing around me.\r\n\r\n\"I knew that I was in Wessex, for I had taken care to go to a lecture\r\non the subject before starting. Wessex lies above the room in which\r\nwe are talking now. It was once an important state. Its kings held\r\nall the southern coast from the Andredswald to Cornwall, while the\r\nWansdyke protected them on the north, running over the high ground. The\r\nlecturer was only concerned with the rise of Wessex, so I do not know\r\nhow long it remained an international power, nor would the knowledge\r\nhave assisted me. To tell the truth I could do nothing but laugh,\r\nduring this part. There was I, with a pneumatic stopper by my side and\r\na respirator bobbing over my head, imprisoned, all three of us, in a\r\ngrass-grown hollow that was edged with fern.\"\r\n\r\nThen he grew grave again.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky for me that it was a hollow. For the air began to fall back into\r\nit and to fill it as water fills a bowl. I could crawl about. Presently\r\nI stood. I breathed a mixture, in which the air that hurts predominated\r\nwhenever I tried to climb the sides. This was not so bad. I had not\r\nlost my tabloids and remained ridiculously cheerful, and as for the\r\nMachine, I forgot about it altogether. My one aim now was to get to\r\nthe top, where the ferns were, and to view whatever objects lay beyond.\r\n\r\n\"I rushed the slope. The new air was still too bitter for me and I came\r\nrolling back, after a momentary vision of something grey. The sun grew\r\nvery feeble, and I remembered that he was in Scorpio--I had been to a\r\nlecture on that too. If the sun is in Scorpio and you are in Wessex, it\r\nmeans that you must be as quick as you can, or it will get too dark.\r\n(This is the first bit of useful information I have ever got from a\r\nlecture, and I expect it will be the last.) It made me try frantically\r\nto breathe the new air, and to advance as far as I dared out of my\r\npond. The hollow filled so slowly. At times I thought that the fountain\r\nplayed with less vigour. My respirator seemed to dance nearer the\r\nearth; the roar was decreasing.\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think this is interesting you. The rest will interest you even\r\nless. There are no ideas in it, and I wish that I had not troubled you\r\nto come. We are too different, mother.\"\r\n\r\nShe told him to continue.\r\n\r\n\"It was evening before I climbed the bank. The sun had very nearly\r\nslipped out of the sky by this time, and I could not get a good view.\r\nYou, who have just crossed the Roof of the World, will not want to hear\r\nan account of the little hills that I saw--low colourless hills. But to\r\nme they were living and the turf that covered them was a skin, under\r\nwhich their muscles rippled, and I felt that those hills had called\r\nwith incalculable force to men in the past, and that men had loved\r\nthem. Now they sleep--perhaps for ever. They commune with humanity in\r\ndreams. Happy the man, happy the woman, who awakes the hills of Wessex.\r\nFor though they sleep, they will never die.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice rose passionately.\r\n\r\n\"Cannot you see, cannot all your lecturers see, that it is we who are\r\ndying, and that down here the only thing that really lives is the\r\nMachine? We created the Machine, to do our will, but we cannot make it\r\ndo our will now. It has robbed us of the sense of space and of the\r\nsense of touch, it has blurred every human relation and narrowed down\r\nlove to a carnal act, it has paralysed our bodies and our wills, and\r\nnow it compels us to worship it. The Machine develops--but not on our\r\nlines. The Machine proceeds--but not to our goal. We only exist as the\r\nblood corpuscles that course through its arteries, and if it could work\r\nwithout us, it would let us die. Oh, I have no remedy--or, at least,\r\nonly one--to tell men again and again that I have seen the hills of\r\nWessex as Ælfrid saw them when he overthrew the Danes.\r\n\r\n\"So the sun set. I forgot to mention that a belt of mist lay between my\r\nhill and other hills, and that it was the colour of pearl.\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off for the second time.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said his mother wearily.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Go on. Nothing that you say can distress me now. I am hardened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had meant to tell you the rest, but I cannot: I know that I cannot:\r\ngood-bye.\"\r\n\r\nVashti stood irresolute. All her nerves were tingling with his\r\nblasphemies. But she was also inquisitive.\r\n\r\n\"This is unfair,\" she complained. \"You have called me across the\r\nworld to hear your story, and hear it I will. Tell me--as briefly as\r\npossible, for this is a disastrous waste of time--tell me how you\r\nreturned to civilisation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--that!\" he said, starting. \"You would like to hear about\r\ncivilisation. Certainly. Had I got to where my respirator fell down?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--but I understand everything now. You put on your respirator, and\r\nmanaged to walk along the surface of the earth to a vomitory, and there\r\nyour conduct was reported to the Central Committee.\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means.\"\r\n\r\nHe passed his hand over his forehead, as if dispelling some strong\r\nimpression. Then, resuming his narrative, he warmed to it again.\r\n\r\n\"My respirator fell about sunset. I had mentioned that the fountain\r\nseemed feebler, had I not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"About sunset, it let the respirator fall. As I said, I had entirely\r\nforgotten about the Machine, and I paid no great attention at the time,\r\nbeing occupied with other things. I had my pool of air, into which I\r\ncould dip when the outer keenness became intolerable, and which would\r\npossibly remain for days, provided that no wind sprang up to disperse\r\nit. Not until it was too late, did I realize what the stoppage of the\r\nescape implied. You see--the gap in the tunnel had been mended; the\r\nMending Apparatus; the Mending Apparatus, was after me.\r\n\r\n\"One other warning I had, but I neglected it. The sky at night was\r\nclearer than it had been in the day, and the moon, which was about\r\nhalf the sky behind the sun, shone into the dell at moments quite\r\nbrightly. I was in my usual place--on the boundary between the two\r\natmospheres--when I thought I saw something dark move across the\r\nbottom of the dell, and vanish into the shaft. In my folly, I ran down.\r\nI bent over and listened, and I thought I heard a faint scraping noise\r\nin the depths.\r\n\r\n\"At this--but it was too late--I took alarm. I determined to put on my\r\nrespirator and to walk right out of the dell. But my respirator had\r\ngone. I knew exactly where it had fallen--between the stopper and the\r\naperture--and I could even feel the mark that it had made in the turf.\r\nIt had gone, and I realized that something evil was at work, and I had\r\nbetter escape to the other air, and, if I must die, die running towards\r\nthe cloud that had been the colour of a pearl. I never started. Out of\r\nthe shaft--it is too horrible. A worm, a long white worm, had crawled\r\nout of the shaft and was gliding over the moonlit grass.\r\n\r\n\"I screamed. I did everything that I should not have done, I stamped\r\nupon the creature instead of flying from it, and it at once curled\r\nround the ankle. Then we fought. The worm let me run all over the\r\ndell, but edged up my leg as I ran. 'Help!' I cried. (That part is\r\ntoo awful. It belongs to the part that you will never know.) 'Help!'\r\nI cried. (Why cannot we suffer in silence?) 'Help!' I cried. Then my\r\nfeet were wound together, I fell, I was dragged away from the dear\r\nferns and the living hills, and past the great metal stopper (I can\r\ntell you this part), and I thought it might save me again if I caught\r\nhold of the handle. It also was enwrapped, it also. Oh, the whole dell\r\nwas full of the things. They were searching it in all directions,\r\nthey were denuding it, and the white snouts of others peeped out\r\nof the hole, ready if needed. Everything that could be moved they\r\nbrought--brushwood, bundles of fern, everything, and down we all went\r\nintertwined into hell. The last things that I saw, ere the stopper\r\nclosed after us, were certain stars, and I felt that a man of my sort\r\nlived in the sky. For I did fight, I fought till the very end, and it\r\nwas only my head hitting against the ladder that quieted me. I woke up\r\nin this room. The worms had vanished. I was surrounded by artificial\r\nair, artificial light, artificial peace, and my friends were calling to\r\nme down speaking-tubes to know whether I had come across any new ideas\r\nlately.\"\r\n\r\nHere his story ended. Discussion of it was impossible, and Vashti\r\nturned to go.\r\n\r\n\"It will end in Homelessness,\" she said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"I wish it would,\" retorted Kuno.\r\n\r\n\"The Machine has been most merciful.\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer the mercy of God.\"\r\n\r\n\"By that superstitious phrase, do you mean that you could live in the\r\nouter air?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever seen, round the vomitories, the bones of those who were\r\nextruded after the Great Rebellion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were left where they perished for our edification. A few crawled\r\naway, but they perished, too--who can doubt it? And so with the\r\nHomeless of our own day. The surface of the earth supports life no\r\nlonger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ferns and a little grass may survive, but all higher forms have\r\nperished. Has any air-ship detected them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has any lecturer dealt with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why this obstinacy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have seen them,\" he exploded.\r\n\r\n\"Seen _what_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have seen her in the twilight--because she came to my help\r\nwhen I called--because she, too, was entangled by the worms, and,\r\nluckier than I, was killed by one of them piercing her throat.\"\r\n\r\nHe was mad. Vashti departed, nor, in the troubles that followed, did\r\nshe ever see his face again.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Part III_\r\n\r\n                             THE HOMELESS\r\n\r\nDuring the years that followed Kuno's escapade, two important\r\ndevelopments took place in the Machine. On the surface they were\r\nrevolutionary, but in either case men's minds had been prepared\r\nbeforehand, and they did but express tendencies that were latent\r\nalready.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was the abolition of respirators.\r\n\r\nAdvanced thinkers, like Vashti, had always held it foolish to visit\r\nthe surface of the earth. Air-ships might be necessary, but what was\r\nthe good of going out for mere curiosity and crawling along for a\r\nmile or two in a terrestrial motor? The habit was vulgar and perhaps\r\nfaintly improper: it was unproductive of ideas, and had no connection\r\nwith the habits that really mattered. So respirators were abolished,\r\nand with them, of course, the terrestrial motors, and except for a\r\nfew lecturers, who complained that they were debarred access to their\r\nsubject-matter, the development was accepted quietly. Those who still\r\nwanted to know what the earth was like had after all only to listen\r\nto some gramophone, or to look into some cinematophote. And even the\r\nlecturers acquiesced when they found that a lecture on the sea was\r\nnone the less stimulating when compiled out of other lectures that\r\nhad already been delivered on the same subject. \"Beware of first-hand\r\nideas!\" exclaimed one of the most advanced of them. \"First-hand ideas\r\ndo not really exist. They are but the physical impressions produced\r\nby love and fear, and on this gross foundation who could erect a\r\nphilosophy? Let your ideas be second-hand, and if possible tenth-hand,\r\nfor then they will be far removed from that disturbing element--direct\r\nobservation. Do not learn anything about this subject of mine--the\r\nFrench Revolution. Learn instead what I think that Enicharmon thought\r\nUrizen thought Gutch thought Ho-Yung thought Chi-Bo-Sing thought\r\nLafcadio Hearn thought Carlyle thought Mirabeau said about the French\r\nRevolution. Through the medium of these eight great minds, the blood\r\nthat was shed at Paris and the windows that were broken at Versailles\r\nwill be clarified to an idea which you may employ most profitably in\r\nyour daily lives. But be sure that the intermediates are many and\r\nvaried, for in history one authority exists to counteract another.\r\nUrizen must counteract the scepticism of Ho-Yung and Enicharmon, I must\r\nmyself counteract the impetuosity of Gutch. You who listen to me are\r\nin a better position to judge about the French Revolution than I am.\r\nYour descendants will be even in a better position than you, for they\r\nwill learn what you think I think, and yet another intermediate will be\r\nadded to the chain. And in time\"--his voice rose--\"there will come a\r\ngeneration that has got beyond facts, beyond impressions, a generation\r\nabsolutely colourless, a generation\r\n\r\n      'seraphically free\r\n    From taint of personality,'\r\n\r\nwhich will see the French Revolution not as it happened, nor as they\r\nwould like it to have happened, but as it would have happened, had it\r\ntaken place in the days of the Machine.\"\r\n\r\nTremendous applause greeted this lecture, which did but voice a feeling\r\nalready latent in the minds of men--a feeling that terrestrial facts\r\nmust be ignored, and that the abolition of respirators was a positive\r\ngain. It was even suggested that air-ships should be abolished too.\r\nThis was not done, because air-ships had somehow worked themselves\r\ninto the Machine's system. But year by year they were used less, and\r\nmentioned less by thoughtful men.\r\n\r\nThe second great development was the re-establishment of religion.\r\n\r\nThis, too, had been voiced in the celebrated lecture. No one could\r\nmistake the reverent tone in which the peroration had concluded, and\r\nit awakened a responsive echo in the heart of each. Those who had long\r\nworshipped silently, now began to talk. They described the strange\r\nfeeling of peace that came over them when they handled the Book of the\r\nMachine, the pleasure that it was to repeat certain numerals out of it,\r\nhowever little meaning those numerals conveyed to the outward ear, the\r\necstasy of touching a button, however unimportant, or of ringing an\r\nelectric bell, however superfluously.\r\n\r\n\"The Machine,\" they exclaimed, \"feeds us and clothes us and houses us;\r\nthrough it we speak to one another, through it we see one another, in\r\nit we have our being. The Machine is the friend of ideas and the enemy\r\nof superstition: the Machine is omnipotent, eternal; blessed is the\r\nMachine.\" And before long this allocution was printed on the first\r\npage of the Book, and in subsequent editions the ritual swelled into\r\na complicated system of praise and prayer. The word \"religion\" was\r\nsedulously avoided, and in theory the Machine was still the creation\r\nand the implement of man. But in practice all, save a few retrogrades,\r\nworshipped it as divine. Nor was it worshipped in unity. One believer\r\nwould be chiefly impressed by the blue optic plates, through which he\r\nsaw other believers; another by the mending apparatus, which sinful\r\nKuno had compared to worms; another by the lifts, another by the Book.\r\nAnd each would pray to this or to that, and ask it to intercede for\r\nhim with the Machine as a whole. Persecution--that also was present.\r\nIt did not break out, for reasons that will be set forward shortly.\r\nBut it was latent, and all who did not accept the minimum known as\r\n\"undenominational Mechanism\" lived in danger of Homelessness, which\r\nmeans death, as we know.\r\n\r\nTo attribute these two great developments to the Central Committee,\r\nis to take a very narrow view of civilisation. The Central Committee\r\nannounced the developments, it is true, but they were no more the cause\r\nof them than were the kings of the imperialistic period the cause of\r\nwar. Rather did they yield to some invincible pressure, which came no\r\none knew whither, and which, when gratified, was succeeded by some\r\nnew pressure equally invincible. To such a state of affairs it is\r\nconvenient to give the name of progress. No one confessed the Machine\r\nwas out of hand. Year by year it was served with increased efficiency\r\nand decreased intelligence. The better a man knew his own duties upon\r\nit, the less he understood the duties of his neighbour, and in all the\r\nworld there was not one who understood the monster as a whole. Those\r\nmaster brains had perished. They had left full directions, it is true,\r\nand their successors had each of them mastered a portion of those\r\ndirections. But Humanity, in its desire for comfort, had over-reached\r\nitself. It had exploited the riches of nature too far. Quietly and\r\ncomplacently, it was sinking into decadence, and progress had come to\r\nmean the progress of the Machine.\r\n\r\nAs for Vashti, her life went peacefully forward until the final\r\ndisaster. She made her room dark and slept; she awoke and made the room\r\nlight. She lectured and attended lectures. She exchanged ideas with her\r\ninnumerable friends and believed she was growing more spiritual. At\r\ntimes a friend was granted Euthanasia, and left his or her room for\r\nthe homelessness that is beyond all human conception. Vashti did not\r\nmuch mind. After an unsuccessful lecture, she would sometimes ask for\r\nEuthanasia herself. But the death-rate was not permitted to exceed the\r\nbirth-rate, and the Machine had hitherto refused it to her.\r\n\r\nThe troubles began quietly, long before she was conscious of them.\r\n\r\nOne day she was astonished at receiving a message from her son. They\r\nnever communicated, having nothing in common, and she had only heard\r\nindirectly that he was still alive, and had been transferred from the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, where he had behaved so mischievously, to the\r\nsouthern--indeed, to a room not far from her own.\r\n\r\n\"Does he want me to visit him?\" she thought. \"Never again, never. And I\r\nhave not the time.\"\r\n\r\nNo, it was madness of another kind.\r\n\r\nHe refused to visualize his face upon the blue plate, and speaking out\r\nof the darkness with solemnity said:\r\n\r\n\"The Machine stops.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Machine is stopping, I know it, I know the signs.\"\r\n\r\nShe burst into a peal of laughter. He heard her and was angry, and they\r\nspoke no more.\r\n\r\n\"Can you imagine anything more absurd?\" she cried to a friend. \"A man\r\nwho was my son believes that the Machine is stopping. It would be\r\nimpious if it was not mad.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Machine is stopping?\" her friend replied. \"What does that mean?\r\nThe phrase conveys nothing to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"He does not refer, I suppose, to the trouble there has been lately\r\nwith the music?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, of course not. Let us talk about music.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you complained to the authorities?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and they say it wants mending, and referred me to the Committee\r\nof the Mending Apparatus. I complained of those curious gasping sighs\r\nthat disfigure the symphonies of the Brisbane school. They sound like\r\nsome one in pain. The Committee of the Mending Apparatus say that it\r\nshall be remedied shortly.\"\r\n\r\nObscurely worried, she resumed her life. For one thing, the defect in\r\nthe music irritated her. For another thing, she could not forget Kuno's\r\nspeech. If he had known that the music was out of repair--he could not\r\nknow it, for he detested music--if he had known that it was wrong,\r\n\"the Machine stops\" was exactly the venomous sort of remark he would\r\nhave made. Of course he had made it at a venture, but the coincidence\r\nannoyed her, and she spoke with some petulance to the Committee of the\r\nMending Apparatus.\r\n\r\nThey replied, as before, that the defect would be set right shortly.\r\n\r\n\"Shortly! At once!\" she retorted. \"Why should I be worried by imperfect\r\nmusic? Things are always put right at once. If you do not mend it at\r\nonce, I shall complain to the Central Committee.\"\r\n\r\n\"No personal complaints are received by the Central Committee,\" the\r\nCommittee of the Mending Apparatus replied.\r\n\r\n\"Through whom am I to make my complaint, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Through us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I complain then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your complaint shall be forwarded in its turn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have others complained?\"\r\n\r\nThis question was unmechanical, and the Committee of the Mending\r\nApparatus refused to answer it.\r\n\r\n\"It is too bad!\" she exclaimed to another of her friends. \"There never\r\nwas such an unfortunate woman as myself. I can never be sure of my\r\nmusic now. It gets worse and worse each time I summon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I too have my troubles,\" the friend replied. \"Sometimes my ideas are\r\ninterrupted by a slight jarring noise.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know whether it is inside my head, or inside the wall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Complain, in either case.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have complained, and my complaint will be forwarded in its turn to\r\nthe Central Committee.\"\r\n\r\nTime passed, and they resented the defects no longer. The defects\r\nhad not been remedied, but the human tissues in that latter day had\r\nbecome so subservient, that they readily adapted themselves to every\r\ncaprice of the Machine. The sigh at the crisis of the Brisbane symphony\r\nno longer irritated Vashti; she accepted it as part of the melody.\r\nThe jarring noise, whether in the head or in the wall, was no longer\r\nresented by her friend. And so with the mouldy artificial fruit, so\r\nwith the bath water that began to stink, so with the defective rhymes\r\nthat the poetry machine had taken to emit. All were bitterly complained\r\nof at first, and then acquiesced in and forgotten. Things went from\r\nbad to worse unchallenged.\r\n\r\nIt was otherwise with the failure of the sleeping apparatus. That\r\nwas a more serious stoppage. There came a day when over the whole\r\nworld--in Sumatra, in Wessex, in the innumerable cities of Courland\r\nand Brazil--the beds, when summoned by their tired owners, failed\r\nto appear. It may seem a ludicrous matter, but from it we may date\r\nthe collapse of humanity. The Committee responsible for the failure\r\nwas assailed by complainants, whom it referred, as usual, to the\r\nCommittee of the Mending Apparatus, who in its turn assured them that\r\ntheir complaints would be forwarded to the Central Committee. But the\r\ndiscontent grew, for mankind was not yet sufficiently adaptable to do\r\nwithout sleeping.\r\n\r\n\"Some one is meddling with the Machine----\" they began.\r\n\r\n\"Some one is trying to make himself king, to reintroduce the personal\r\nelement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Punish that man with Homelessness.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the rescue! Avenge the Machine! Avenge the Machine!\"\r\n\r\n\"War! Kill the man!\"\r\n\r\nBut the Committee of the Mending Apparatus now came forward, and\r\nallayed the panic with well-chosen words. It confessed that the Mending\r\nApparatus was itself in need of repair.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this frank confession was admirable.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said a famous lecturer--he of the French Revolution, who\r\ngilded each new decay with splendour--\"of course we shall not press our\r\ncomplaints now. The Mending Apparatus has treated us so well in the\r\npast that we all sympathize with it, and will wait patiently for its\r\nrecovery. In its own good time it will resume its duties. Meanwhile let\r\nus do without our beds, our tabloids, our other little wants. Such, I\r\nfeel sure, would be the wish of the Machine.\"\r\n\r\nThousands of miles away his audience applauded. The Machine still\r\nlinked them. Under the seas, beneath the roots of the mountains, ran\r\nthe wires through which they saw and heard, the enormous eyes and ears\r\nthat were their heritage, and the hum of many workings clothed their\r\nthoughts in one garment of subserviency. Only the old and the sick\r\nremained ungrateful, for it was rumoured that Euthanasia, too, was out\r\nof order, and that pain had reappeared among men.\r\n\r\nIt became difficult to read. A blight entered the atmosphere and dulled\r\nits luminosity. At times Vashti could scarcely see across her room. The\r\nair, too, was foul. Loud were the complaints, impotent the remedies,\r\nheroic the tone of the lecturer as he cried: \"Courage, courage! What\r\nmatter so long as the Machine goes on? To it the darkness and the\r\nlight are one.\" And though things improved again after a time, the old\r\nbrilliancy was never recaptured, and humanity never recovered from its\r\nentrance into twilight. There was an hysterical talk of \"measures,\"\r\nof \"provisional dictatorship,\" and the inhabitants of Sumatra were\r\nasked to familiarize themselves with the workings of the central\r\npower station, the said power station being situated in France. But\r\nfor the most part panic reigned, and men spent their strength praying\r\nto their Books, tangible proofs of the Machine's omnipotence. There\r\nwere gradations of terror--at times came rumours of hope--the Mending\r\nApparatus was almost mended--the enemies of the Machine had been got\r\nunder--new \"nerve-centres\" were evolving which would do the work even\r\nmore magnificently than before. But there came a day when, without the\r\nslightest warning, without any previous hint of feebleness, the entire\r\ncommunication-system broke down, all over the world, and the world, as\r\nthey understood it, ended.\r\n\r\nVashti was lecturing at the time and her earlier remarks had been\r\npunctuated with applause. As she proceeded the audience became silent,\r\nand at the conclusion there was no sound. Somewhat displeased, she\r\ncalled to a friend who was a specialist in sympathy. No sound:\r\ndoubtless the friend was sleeping. And so with the next friend whom\r\nshe tried to summon, and so with the next, until she remembered Kuno's\r\ncryptic remark, \"The Machine stops.\"\r\n\r\nThe phrase still conveyed nothing. If Eternity was stopping it would of\r\ncourse be set going shortly.\r\n\r\nFor example, there was still a little light and air--the atmosphere had\r\nimproved a few hours previously. There was still the Book, and while\r\nthere was the Book there was security.\r\n\r\nThen she broke down, for with the cessation of activity came an\r\nunexpected terror--silence.\r\n\r\nShe had never known silence, and the coming of it nearly killed\r\nher--it did kill many thousands of people outright. Ever since her\r\nbirth she had been surrounded by the steady hum. It was to the ear\r\nwhat artificial air was to the lungs, and agonizing pains shot across\r\nher head. And scarcely knowing what she did, she stumbled forward and\r\npressed the unfamiliar button, the one that opened the door of her cell.\r\n\r\nNow the door of the cell worked on a simple hinge of its own. It was\r\nnot connected with the central power station, dying far away in France.\r\nIt opened, rousing immoderate hopes in Vashti, for she thought that the\r\nMachine had been mended. It opened, and she saw the dim tunnel that\r\ncurved far away towards freedom. One look, and then she shrank back.\r\nFor the tunnel was full of people--she was almost the last in that city\r\nto have taken alarm.\r\n\r\nPeople at any time repelled her, and these were nightmares from her\r\nworst dreams. People were crawling about, people were screaming,\r\nwhimpering, gasping for breath, touching each other, vanishing in the\r\ndark, and ever and anon being pushed off the platform on to the live\r\nrail. Some were fighting round the electric bells, trying to summon\r\ntrains which could not be summoned. Others were yelling for Euthanasia\r\nor for respirators, or blaspheming the Machine. Others stood at the\r\ndoors of their cells fearing, like herself, either to stop in them or\r\nto leave them. And behind all the uproar was silence--the silence which\r\nis the voice of the earth and of the generations who have gone.\r\n\r\nNo--it was worse than solitude. She closed the door again and sat\r\ndown to wait for the end. The disintegration went on, accompanied by\r\nhorrible cracks and rumbling. The valves that restrained the Medical\r\nApparatus must have been weakened, for it ruptured and hung hideously\r\nfrom the ceiling. The floor heaved and fell and flung her from her\r\nchair. A tube oozed towards her serpent fashion. And at last the final\r\nhorror approached--light began to ebb, and she knew that civilisation's\r\nlong day was closing.\r\n\r\nShe whirled round, praying to be saved from this, at any rate, kissing\r\nthe Book, pressing button after button. The uproar outside was\r\nincreasing, and even penetrated the wall. Slowly the brilliancy of her\r\ncell was dimmed, the reflections faded from her metal switches. Now\r\nshe could not see the reading-stand, now not the Book, though she held\r\nit in her hand. Light followed the flight of sound, air was following\r\nlight, and the original void returned to the cavern from which it had\r\nbeen so long excluded. Vashti continued to whirl, like the devotees of\r\nan earlier religion, screaming, praying, striking at the buttons with\r\nbleeding hands.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that she opened her prison and escaped--escaped in the\r\nspirit: at least so it seems to me, ere my meditation closes. That she\r\nescapes in the body--I cannot perceive that. She struck, by chance, the\r\nswitch that released the door, and the rush of foul air on her skin,\r\nthe loud throbbing whispers in her ears, told her that she was facing\r\nthe tunnel again, and that tremendous platform on which she had seen\r\nmen fighting. They were not fighting now. Only the whispers remained,\r\nand the little whimpering groans. They were dying by hundreds out in\r\nthe dark.\r\n\r\nShe burst into tears.\r\n\r\nTears answered her.\r\n\r\nThey wept for humanity, those two, not for themselves. They could not\r\nbear that this should be the end. Ere silence was completed their\r\nhearts were opened, and they knew what had been important on the earth.\r\nMan, the flower of all flesh, the noblest of all creatures visible,\r\nman who had once made god in his image, and had mirrored his strength\r\non the constellations, beautiful naked man was dying, strangled in the\r\ngarments that he had woven. Century after century had he toiled, and\r\nhere was his reward. Truly the garment had seemed heavenly at first,\r\nshot with the colours of culture, sewn with the threads of self-denial.\r\nAnd heavenly it had been so long as it was a garment and no more, so\r\nlong as man could shed it at will and live by the essence that is\r\nhis soul, and the essence, equally divine, that is his body. The sin\r\nagainst the body--it was for that they wept in chief; the centuries of\r\nwrong against the muscles and the nerves, and those five portals by\r\nwhich we can alone apprehend--glozing it over with talk of evolution,\r\nuntil the body was white pap, the home of ideas as colourless, last\r\nsloshy stirrings of a spirit that had grasped the stars.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you?\" she sobbed.\r\n\r\nHis voice in the darkness said, \"Here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any hope, Kuno?\"\r\n\r\n\"None for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you?\"\r\n\r\nShe crawled towards him over the bodies of the dead. His blood spurted\r\nover her hands.\r\n\r\n\"Quicker,\" he gasped, \"I am dying--but we touch, we talk, not through\r\nthe Machine.\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her.\r\n\r\n\"We have come back to our own. We die, but we have recaptured life,\r\nas it was in Wessex, when Ælfrid overthrew the Danes. We know what\r\nthey know outside, they who dwelt in the cloud that is the colour of a\r\npearl.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Kuno, is it true? Are there still men on the surface of the\r\nearth? Is this--this tunnel, this poisoned darkness--really not the\r\nend?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied:\r\n\r\n\"I have seen them, spoken to them, loved them. They are hiding in the\r\nmist and the ferns until our civilisation stops. Today they are the\r\nHomeless--tomorrow----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, tomorrow--some fool will start the Machine again, tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" said Kuno, \"never. Humanity has learnt its lesson.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the whole city was broken like a honeycomb. An air-ship\r\nhad sailed in through the vomitory into a ruined wharf. It crashed\r\ndownwards, exploding as it went, rending gallery after gallery with its\r\nwings of steel. For a moment they saw the nations of the dead, and,\r\nbefore they joined them, scraps of the untainted sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE POINT OF IT\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\n\"I don't see the point of it,\" said Micky, through much imbecile\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nHarold went on rowing. They had spent too long on the sand-dunes,\r\nand now the tide was running out of the estuary strongly. The sun\r\nwas setting, the fields on the opposite bank shone bright, and the\r\nfarm-house where they were stopping glowed from its upper windows as\r\nthough filled to the brim with fire.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to be carried out to sea,\" Micky continued. \"You'll never\r\nwin unless you bust yourself a bit, and you a poor invalid, too. I back\r\nthe sea.\"\r\n\r\nThey were reaching the central channel, the backbone, as it were,\r\nof the retreating waters. Once past it, the force of the tide would\r\nslacken, and they would have easy going until they beached under the\r\nfarm. It was a glorious evening. It had been a most glorious day. They\r\nhad rowed out to the dunes at the slack, bathed, raced, eaten, slept,\r\nbathed and raced and eaten again. Micky was in roaring spirits. God had\r\nnever thwarted him hitherto, and he could not suppose that they would\r\nreally be made late for supper by an ebbing tide. When they came to\r\nthe channel, and the boat, which had been slowly edging upstream, hung\r\nmotionless among the moving waters, he lost all semblance of sanity,\r\nand shouted:\r\n\r\n    \"It may be that the gulfs will wash us down,\r\n    It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,\r\n    And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.\"\r\n\r\nHarold, who did not care for poetry, only shouted. His spirits also\r\nwere roaring, and he neither looked nor felt a poor invalid. Science\r\nhad talked to him seriously of late, shaking her head at his sunburnt\r\nbody. What should Science know? She had sent him down to the sea to\r\nrecruit, and Micky to see that he did not tire himself. Micky had been\r\na nuisance at first, but common sense had prevailed, as it always does\r\namong the young. A fortnight ago, he would not let the patient handle\r\nan oar. Now he bid him \"bust\" himself, and Harold took him at his word\r\nand did so. He made himself all will and muscle. He began not to know\r\nwhere he was. The thrill of the stretcher against his feet, and of the\r\ntide up his arms, merged with his friend's voice towards one nameless\r\nsensation; he was approaching the mystic state that is the athlete's\r\ntrue though unacknowledged goal: he was beginning to be.\r\n\r\nMicky chanted, \"One, two--one, two,\" and tried to help by twitching the\r\nrudder. But Micky had imagination. He looked at the flaming windows and\r\nfancied that the farm was a star and the boat its attendant satellite.\r\nThen the tide was the rushing ether stream of the universe, the\r\ninterstellar surge that beats for ever. How jolly! He did not formulate\r\nhis joys, after the weary fashion of older people. He was far too happy\r\nto be thankful. \"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth,\"\r\nare the words of one who has left his youth behind, and all that Micky\r\nsang was \"One, two.\"\r\n\r\nHarold laughed without hearing. Sweat poured off his forehead. He put\r\non a spurt, as did the tide.\r\n\r\n\"Wish the doctor could see you,\" cried Micky.\r\n\r\nNo answer. Setting his teeth, he went berserk. His ancestors called to\r\nhim that it was better to die than to be beaten by the sea. He rowed\r\nwith gasps and angry little cries, while the voice of the helmsman\r\nlashed him to fury.\r\n\r\n\"That's right--one, two--plug it in harder.... Oh, I say, this is a bit\r\nstiff, though. Let's give it up, old man, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\nThe gulls were about them now. Some wheeled overhead, others bobbed\r\npast on the furrowed waters. The song of a lark came faintly from the\r\nland, and Micky saw the doctor's trap driving along the road that led\r\nto the farm. He felt ashamed.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Harold, you oughtn't to--I oughtn't to have let you. I--I\r\ndon't see the point of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you?\" said Harold with curious distinctness. \"Well, you will\r\nsome day,\" and so saying dropped both oars. The boat spun round at\r\nthis, the farm, the trap, the song of the lark vanished, and he fell\r\nheavily against the rowlock. Micky caught at him. He had strained his\r\nheart. Half in the boat and half out of it, he died, a rotten business.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nA rotten business. It happened when Michael was twenty-two, and he\r\nexpected never to be happy again. The sound of his own voice shouting\r\nas he was carried out, the doctor's voice saying, \"I consider you\r\nresponsible,\" the coming of Harold's parents, the voice of the curate\r\nsummarizing Harold's relations with the unseen--all these things\r\naffected him so deeply that he supposed they would affect him for\r\never. They did not, because he lived to be over seventy, and with the\r\nbest will in the world, it is impossible to remember clearly for so\r\nlong. The mind, however sensitive and affectionate, is coated with new\r\nexperiences daily; it cannot clear itself of the steady accretion,\r\nand is forced either to forget the past or to distort it. So it was\r\nwith Michael. In time only the more dramatic incidents survived.\r\nHe remembered Harold's final gesture (one hand grasping his own,\r\nthe other plunged deep into the sea), because there was a certain\r\næsthetic quality about it, not because it was the last of his friend.\r\nHe remembered the final words for the same reason. \"Don't you see the\r\npoint of it? Well, you will some day.\" The phrase struck his fancy, and\r\npassed into his own stock; after thirty or forty years he forgot its\r\norigin. He is not to blame; the business of life snowed him under.\r\n\r\nThere is also this to say: he and Harold had nothing in common except\r\nyouth. No spiritual bond could survive. They had never discussed\r\ntheology or social reform, or any of the problems that were thronging\r\nMichael's brain, and consequently, though they had been intimate\r\nenough, there was nothing to remember. Harold melted the more one\r\nthought of him. Robbed of his body, he was so shadowy. Nor could one\r\nimagine him as a departed spirit, for the world beyond death is surely\r\naugust. Neither in heaven nor hell is there place for athletics and\r\naimless good temper, and if these were taken from Harold, what was\r\nleft? Even if the unseen life should prove an archetype of this, even\r\nif it should contain a sun and stars of its own, the sunburn of earth\r\nmust fade off our faces as we look at it, the muscles of earth must\r\nwither before we can go rowing on its infinite sea. Michael sadly\r\nresigned his friend to God's mercy. He himself could do nothing, for\r\nmen can only immortalize those who leave behind them some strong\r\nimpression of poetry or wisdom.\r\n\r\nFor himself he expected another fate. With all humility, he knew that\r\nhe was not as Harold. It was no merit of his own, but he had been born\r\nof a more intellectual stock, and had inherited powers that rendered\r\nhim worthier of life, and of whatever may come after it. He cared for\r\nthe universe, for the tiny tangle in it that we call civilisation,\r\nfor his fellow-men who had made the tangle and who transcended it.\r\nLove, the love of humanity, warmed him; and even when he was thinking\r\nof other matters, was looking at Orion perhaps in the cold winter\r\nevenings, a pang of joy, too sweet for description, would thrill him,\r\nand he would feel sure that our highest impulses have some eternal\r\nvalue, and will be completed hereafter. So full a nature could not\r\nbrood over death.\r\n\r\nTo summarize his career.\r\n\r\nSoon after the tragedy, when he in his turn was recruiting, he met the\r\nwoman who was to become his helpmate through life. He had met her once\r\nbefore, and had not liked her; she had seemed uncharitable and hard.\r\nNow he saw that her hardness sprang from a morality that he himself\r\nlacked. If he believed in love, Janet believed in truth. She tested all\r\nmen and all things. She had no patience with the sentimentalist who\r\nshelters from the world's rough and tumble. Engaged at that time to\r\nanother man, she spoke more freely to Michael than she would otherwise\r\nhave done, and told him that it is not enough to feel good and to\r\nfeel that others are good; one's business is to make others better,\r\nand she urged him to adopt a profession. The beauty of honest work\r\ndawned upon the youth as she spoke. Mentally and physically, he came to\r\nfull manhood, and, after due preparation, he entered the Home Civil\r\nService--the British Museum.\r\n\r\nHere began a career that was rather notable, and wholly beneficial\r\nto humanity. With his ideals of conduct and culture, Michael was not\r\ncontent with the official routine. He desired to help others, and,\r\nsince he was gifted with tact, they consented to the operation. Before\r\nlong he became a conciliatory force in his department. He could mollify\r\nhis superiors, encourage his inferiors, soothe foreign scholars, and\r\nshow that there is something to be said for all sides. Janet, who\r\nwatched his rise, taxed him again with instability. But now she was\r\nwrong. The young man was not a mere opportunist. He always had a\r\nsincere opinion of his own, or he could not have retained the respect\r\nof his colleagues. It was really the inherent sweetness of his nature\r\nat work, turned by a woman's influence towards fruitful ends.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a ten years' acquaintance the two married. In the\r\ninterval Janet had suffered much pain, for the man to whom she had been\r\nengaged had proved unworthy of her. Her character was set when she\r\ncame to Michael, and, as he knew, strongly contrasted with his own;\r\nand perhaps they had already interchanged all the good they could. But\r\nthe marriage proved durable and sufficiently happy. He, in particular,\r\nmade endless allowances, for toleration and sympathy were becoming the\r\ncardinal points of his nature. If his wife was unfair to the official\r\nmind, or if his brother-in-law, an atheist, denounced religion, he\r\nwould say to himself, \"They cannot help it; they are made thus, and\r\nhave the qualities of their defects. Let me rather think of my own, and\r\nstrive for a wider outlook ceaselessly.\" He grew sweeter every day.\r\n\r\nIt was partly this desire for a wider outlook that turned him to\r\nliterature. As he was crossing the forties it occurred to him to write\r\na few essays, somewhat retrospective in tone, and thoughtful rather\r\nthan profound in content. They had some success. Their good taste,\r\ntheir lucid style, the tempered Christianity of their ethics, whetted\r\nthe half-educated public, and made it think and feel. They were not,\r\nand were not intended to be, great literature, but they opened the\r\ndoors to it, and were indubitably a power for good. The first volume\r\nwas followed by \"The Confessions of a Middle-aged Man.\" In it Michael\r\npaid melodious tribute to youth, but showed that ripeness is all.\r\nExperience, he taught, is the only humanizer; sympathy, balance and\r\nmany-sidedness cannot come to a man until he is elderly. It is always\r\npleasant to be told that the best is yet to be, and the sale of the\r\nbook was large. Perhaps he would have become a popular author, but\r\nhis wife's influence restrained him from writing anything that he did\r\nnot sincerely feel. She had borne him three children by now--Henry,\r\nCatherine, and Adam. On the whole they were a happy family. Henry never\r\ngave any trouble. Catherine took after her mother. Adam, who was wild\r\nand uncouth, caused his father some anxiety. He could not understand\r\nhim, in spite of careful observation, and they never became real\r\nfriends. Still, it was but a little cloud in a large horizon. At home,\r\nas in his work, Michael was more successful than most men.\r\n\r\nThus he slipped into the fifties. On the death of his father he\r\ninherited a house in the Surrey hills, and Janet, whose real interests\r\nwere horticultural, settled down there. After all, she had not proved\r\nan intellectual woman. Her fierce manner had misled him and perhaps\r\nherself into believing it. She was efficient enough in London society,\r\nbut it bored her, for she lacked her husband's pliancy, and aged more\r\nrapidly than he did. Nor did the country suit her. She grew querulous,\r\ndisputing with other ladies about the names of flowers. And, of course,\r\nthe years were not without their effect on him, too. By now he was\r\nsomewhat of a valetudinarian. He had given up all outdoor sports, and,\r\nthough his health remained good, grew bald, and rather stout and timid.\r\nHe was against late hours, violent exercise, night walks, swimming when\r\nhot, muddling about in open boats, and he often had to check himself\r\nfrom fidgeting the children. Henry, a charming sympathetic lad, would\r\nsqueeze his hand and say, \"All right, father.\" But Catherine and Adam\r\nsometimes frowned. He thought of the children more and more. Now that\r\nhis wife was declining, they were the future, and he was determined to\r\nkeep in touch with them, remembering how his own father had failed with\r\nhim. He believed in gentleness, and often stood between them and their\r\nmother. When the boys grew up he let them choose their own friends.\r\nWhen Catherine, at the age of nineteen, asked if she might go away and\r\nearn some money as a lady gardener, he let her go. In this case he had\r\nhis reward, for Catherine, having killed the flowers, returned. She\r\nwas a restless, scowling young woman, a trial to her mother, who could\r\nnot imagine what girls were coming to. Then she married and improved\r\ngreatly; indeed, she proved his chief support in the coming years.\r\n\r\nFor, soon after her marriage, a great trouble fell on him. Janet became\r\nbedridden, and, after a protracted illness, passed into the unknown.\r\nSir Michael--for he had been knighted--declared that he should not\r\nsurvive her. They were so accustomed to each other, so mutually\r\nnecessary, that he fully expected to pass away after her. In this he\r\nwas mistaken. She died when he was sixty, and he lived to be over\r\nseventy. His character had passed beyond the clutch of circumstance and\r\nhe still retained his old interests and his unconquerable benignity.\r\n\r\nA second trouble followed hard on the first. It transpired that Adam\r\nwas devoted to his mother, and had only tolerated home life for her\r\nsake. After a brutal scene he left. He wrote from the Argentine that he\r\nwas sorry, but wanted to start for himself. \"I don't see the point of\r\nit,\" quavered Sir Michael. \"Have I ever stopped him or any of you from\r\nstarting?\" Henry and Catherine agreed with him. Yet he felt that they\r\nunderstood their brother better than he did. \"I have given him freedom\r\nall his life,\" he continued. \"I have given him freedom, what more does\r\nhe want?\" Henry, after hesitation, said, \"There are some people who\r\nfeel that freedom cannot be given. At least I have heard so. Perhaps\r\nAdam is like that. Unless he took freedom he might not feel free.\" Sir\r\nMichael disagreed. \"I have now studied adolescence for many years,\" he\r\nreplied, \"and your conclusions, my dear boy, are ridiculous.\"\r\n\r\nThe two rallied to their father gallantly; and, after all, he spent a\r\ndignified old age. Having retired from the British Museum, he produced\r\na little aftermath of literature. The great public had forgotten him,\r\nbut the courtliness of his \"Musings of a Pensioner\" procured him\r\nsome circulation among elderly and educated audiences. And he found\r\na new spiritual consolation. _Anima naturaliter Anglicana_, he had\r\nnever been hostile to the Established Church; and, when he criticized\r\nher worldliness and occasional inhumanity, had spoken as one who\r\nwas outside her rather than against her. After his wife's death and\r\nthe flight of his son he lost any lingering taste for speculation.\r\nThe experience of years disposed him to accept the experience of\r\ncenturies, and to merge his feeble personal note in the great voice of\r\ntradition. Yes; a serene and dignified old age. Few grudged it to him.\r\nOf course, he had enemies, who professed to see through him, and said\r\nthat Adam had seen through him too; but no impartial observer agreed.\r\nNo ulterior motive had ever biased Sir Michael. The purity of his\r\nrecord was not due to luck, but to purity within, and his conciliatory\r\nmanner sprang from a conciliated soul. He could look back on failures\r\nand mistakes, and he had not carried out the ideals of his youth. Who\r\nhas? But he had succeeded better than most men in modifying those\r\nideals to fit the world of facts, and if love had been modified into\r\nsympathy and sympathy into compromise, let one of his contemporaries\r\ncast the first stone.\r\n\r\nOne fact remained--the fact of death. Hitherto, Sir Michael had never\r\ndied, and at times he was bestially afraid. But more often death\r\nappeared as a prolongation of his present career. He saw himself\r\nquietly and tactfully organizing some corner in infinity with his\r\nwife's assistance; Janet would be greatly improved. He saw himself\r\npassing from a sphere in which he had been efficient into a sphere\r\nwhich combined the familiar with the eternal, and in which he would\r\nbe equally efficient--passing into it with dignity and without pain.\r\nThis life is a preparation for the next. Those who live longest are\r\nconsequently the best prepared. Experience is the great teacher;\r\nblessed are the experienced, for they need not further modify their\r\nideals.\r\n\r\nThe manner of his death was as follows. He, too, met with an accident.\r\nHe was walking from his town house to Catherine's by a short cut\r\nthrough a slum; some women were quarrelling about a fish, and as he\r\npassed they appealed to him. Always courteous, the old man stopped,\r\nsaid that he had not sufficient data to judge on, and advised them to\r\nlay the fish aside for twenty-four hours. This chanced to annoy them,\r\nand they grew more angry with him than with one another. They accused\r\nhim of \"doing them,\" of \"getting round them,\" and one, who was the\r\nworse for drink, said, \"See if he gets round that,\" and slapped him\r\nwith the fish in the face. He fell. When he came to himself he was\r\nlying in bed with one of his headaches.\r\n\r\nHe could hear Catherine's voice. She annoyed him. If he did not open\r\nhis eyes, it was only because he did not choose.\r\n\r\n\"He has been like this for nearly two years,\" said Henry's voice.\r\n\r\nIt was, at the most, ten minutes since he had fallen in the slum. But\r\nhe did not choose to argue.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he's pretty well played out,\" said a third voice--actually the\r\nvoice of Adam; how and when had Adam returned? \"But, then, he's been\r\nthat for the last thirty years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gently, old boy,\" said Henry.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he has,\" said Adam. \"I don't believe in cant. He never did\r\nanything since Mother died, and damned little before. They've forgotten\r\nhis books because they aren't first-hand; they're rearranging the cases\r\nhe arranged in the British Museum. That's the lot. What else has he\r\ndone except tell people to dress warmly, but not too warm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Adam, you really mustn't----\"\r\n\r\n\"It's because nobody speaks up that men of the old man's type\r\nget famous. It's a sign of your sloppy civilisation. You're all\r\nafraid--afraid of originality, afraid of work, afraid of hurting\r\none another's feelings. You let any one come to the top who doesn't\r\nfrighten you, and as soon as he dies you forget him and knight some\r\nother figurehead instead.\"\r\n\r\nAn unknown voice said, \"Shocking, Mr. Adam, shocking. Such a dear old\r\nman, and quite celebrated, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll soon get used to me, nurse.\"\r\n\r\nThe nurse laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Adam, it is a relief to have you,\" said Catherine after a pause. \"I\r\nwant you and your boy to help me with mine.\" Her voice sounded dimmer;\r\nshe had turned from her father without a word of farewell. \"One must\r\nprofit by the mistakes of others ... after all, more heroism.... I am\r\ndetermined to keep in touch with my boy----\"\r\n\r\n\"Larrup him,\" said Adam. \"That's the secret.\" He followed his sister\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\nThen Henry's delightful laugh sounded for the last time. \"You make us\r\nall feel twenty years younger,\" he said; \"more like when----\"\r\n\r\nThe door shut.\r\n\r\nSir Michael grew cold with rage. This was life, this was what the\r\nyounger generation had been thinking. Adam he ignored, but at the\r\nrecollection of Henry and Catherine he determined to die. If he chose,\r\nhe could have risen from bed and driven the whole pack into the\r\nstreet. But he did not choose. He chose rather to leave this shoddy\r\nand ungrateful world. The immense and super-human cynicism that is\r\nlatent in all of us came at last to the top and transformed him. He saw\r\nthe absurdity of love, and the vision so tickled him that he began to\r\nlaugh. The nurse, who had called him a dear old man, bent over him, and\r\nat the same moment two boys came into the sick-room.\r\n\r\n\"How's grandpapa?\" asked one of them--Catherine's boy.\r\n\r\n\"Not so well,\" the nurse answered.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Then the other boy said, \"Come along, let's cut.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they told us not to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should we do what old people tell us! Dad's pretty well played\r\nout, and so's your mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shocking; be off with you both,\" said the nurse; and, with a little\r\ncroon of admiration, Catherine's boy followed his cousin out of the\r\nroom. Their grandfather's mirth increased. He rolled about in the bed;\r\nand, just as he was grasping the full irony of the situation, he died,\r\nand pursued it into the unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nMicky was still in bed. He was aware of so much through long melancholy\r\ndreams. But when he opened his mouth to laugh, it filled with dust.\r\nChoosing to open his eyes, he found that he had swollen enormously, and\r\nlay sunk in the sand of an illimitable plain. As he expected, he had no\r\noccasion greatly to modify his ideals; infinity had merely taken the\r\nplace of his bedroom and of London. Nothing moved on its surface except\r\na few sand-pillars, which would sometimes merge into each other as\r\nthough confabulating, and then fall with a slight hiss. Save for these,\r\nthere was no motion, no noise, nor could he feel any wind.\r\n\r\nHow long had he lain here? Perhaps for years, long before death\r\nperhaps, while his body seemed to be walking among men. Life is so\r\nshort and trivial, that who knows whether we arrive for it entirely,\r\nwhether more than a fraction of the soul is aroused to put on flesh?\r\nThe bud and the blossom perish in a moment, the husk endures, and may\r\nnot the soul be a husk? It seemed to Micky that he had lain in the\r\ndust for ever, suffering and sneering, and that the essence of all\r\nthings, the primal power that lies behind the stars, is senility. Age,\r\ntoothless, dropsical age; ungenerous to age and to youth; born before\r\nall ages, and outlasting them; the universe as old age.\r\n\r\nThe place degraded while it tortured. It was vast, yet ignoble. It\r\nsloped downward into darkness and upward into cloud, but into what\r\ndarkness, what clouds! No tragic splendour glorified them. When he\r\nlooked at them he understood why he was so unhappy, for they were\r\nlooking at him, sneering at him while he sneered. Their dirtiness was\r\nmore ancient than the hues of day and night, their irony more profound;\r\nhe was part of their jest, even as youth was part of his, and slowly he\r\nrealized that he was, and had for some years been, in Hell.\r\n\r\nAll around him lay other figures, huge and fungous. It was as if\r\nthe plain had festered. Some of them could sit up, others scarcely\r\nprotruded from the sand, and he knew that they had made the same\r\nmistake in life as himself, though he did not know yet what the mistake\r\nhad been; probably some little slip, easily avoided had one but been\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nSpeech was permissible. Presently a voice said, \"Is not ours a heavenly\r\nsky? Is it not beautiful?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most beautiful,\" answered Micky, and found each word a stab of pain.\r\nThen he knew that one of the sins here punished was appreciation;\r\nhe was suffering for all the praise that he had given to the bad\r\nand mediocre upon earth; when he had praised out of idleness, or to\r\nplease people, or to encourage people; for all the praise that had\r\nnot been winged with passion. He repeated \"Most beautiful,\" and the\r\nsky quivered, for he was entering into fuller torments now. One ray\r\nof happiness survived: his wife could not be in this place. She had\r\nnot sinned with the people of the plain, and could not suffer their\r\ndistortion. Her view of life had proved right after all; and, in his\r\nutter misery, this comforted him. Janet should again be his religion,\r\nand as eternity dragged forward and returned upon itself and dragged\r\nforward she would show him that old age, if rightly managed, can be\r\nbeautiful; that experience, if rightly received, can lead the soul of\r\nman to bliss. Then he turned to his neighbour, who was continuing his\r\nhymn of praise.\r\n\r\n\"I could lie here for ever,\" he was saying. \"When I think of my\r\nrestlessness during life--that is to say, during what men miscall life,\r\nfor it is death really--this is life--when I think of my restlessness\r\non earth, I am overcome by so much goodness and mercy, I could lie here\r\nfor ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will you?\" asked Micky.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that is the crowning blessing--I shall, and so will you.\"\r\n\r\nHere a pillar of sand passed between them. It was long before they\r\ncould speak or see. Then Micky took up the song, chafed by the\r\nparticles that were working into his soul.\r\n\r\n\"I, too, regret my wasted hours,\" he said, \"especially the hours of my\r\nyouth. I regret all the time I spent in the sun. In later years I did\r\nrepent, and that is why I am admitted here where there is no sun; yes,\r\nand no wind and none of the stars that drove me almost mad at night\r\nonce. It would be appalling, would it not, to see Orion again, the\r\ncentral star of whose sword is not a star but a nebula, the golden seed\r\nof worlds to be. How I dreaded the autumn on earth when Orion rises,\r\nfor he recalled adventure and my youth. It was appalling. How thankful\r\nI am to see him no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but it was worse,\" cried the other, \"to look high leftward from\r\nOrion and see the Twins. Castor and Pollux were brothers, one human,\r\nthe other divine; and Castor died. But Pollux went down to Hell that he\r\nmight be with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; that is so. Pollux went into Hell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the gods had pity on both, and raised them aloft to be stars whom\r\nsailors worship, and all who love and are young. Zeus was their father,\r\nHelen their sister, who brought the Greeks against Troy. I dreaded them\r\nmore than Orion.\"\r\n\r\nThey were silent, watching their own sky. It approved. They had been\r\ncultivated men on earth, and these are capable of the nicer torments\r\nhereafter. Their memories will strike exquisite images to enhance\r\ntheir pain. \"I will speak no more,\" said Micky to himself. \"I will be\r\nsilent through eternity.\" But the darkness prised open his lips, and\r\nimmediately he was speaking.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me more about this abode of bliss,\" he asked. \"Are there grades\r\nin it? Are there ranks in our heaven?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are two heavens,\" the other replied, \"the heaven of the hard and\r\nof the soft. We here lie in the heaven of the soft. It is a sufficient\r\narrangement, for all men grow either hard or soft as they grow old.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the clouds lifted, and, looking up the slope of the\r\nplain, Micky saw that in the distance it was bounded by mountains of\r\nstone, and he knew, without being told, that among those mountains\r\nJanet lay, rigid, and that he should never see her. She had not been\r\nsaved. The darkness would mock her, too, for ever. With him lay the\r\nsentimentalists, the conciliators, the peace-makers, the humanists,\r\nand all who have trusted the warmer vision; with his wife were the\r\nreformers and ascetics and all sword-like souls. By different paths\r\nthey had come to Hell, and Micky now saw what the bustle of life\r\nconceals: that the years are bound either to liquefy a man or to\r\nstiffen him, and that Love and Truth, who seem to contend for our souls\r\nlike angels, hold each the seeds of our decay.\r\n\r\n\"It is, indeed, a sufficient arrangement,\" he said; \"both sufficient\r\nand simple. But answer one question more that my bliss may be\r\nperfected; in which of these two heavens are the young?\"\r\n\r\nHis neighbour answered, \"In neither; there are no young.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke no more, and settled himself more deeply in the dust. Micky\r\ndid the same. He had vague memories of men and women who had died\r\nbefore reaching maturity, of boys and unwedded maidens and youths\r\nlowered into the grave before their parents' eyes. Whither had they\r\ngone, that undeveloped minority? What was the point of their brief\r\nexistence? Had they vanished utterly, or were they given another chance\r\nof accreting experiences until they became like Janet or himself? One\r\nthing was certain: there were no young, either in the mountains or the\r\nplain, and perhaps the very memory of such creatures was an illusion\r\nfostered by cloud.\r\n\r\nThe time was now ripe for a review of his life on earth. He traced his\r\ndecomposition--his work had been soft, his books soft, he had softened\r\nhis relations with other men. He had seen good in everything, and this\r\nis itself a sign of decay. Whatever occurred he had been appreciative,\r\ntolerant, pliant. Consequently he had been a success; Adam was right;\r\nit was the moment in civilisation for his type. He had mistaken\r\nself-criticism for self-discipline, he had muffled in himself and\r\nothers the keen, heroic edge. Yet the luxury of repentance was denied\r\nhim. The fault was his, but the fate humanity's, for every one grows\r\nhard or soft as he grows old.\r\n\r\n\"This is my life,\" thought Micky; \"my books forgotten, my work\r\nsuperseded. This is the whole of my life.\" And his agony increased,\r\nbecause all the same there had been in that life an elusive joy which,\r\nif only he could have distilled it, would have sweetened infinity. It\r\nwas part of the jest that he should try, and should eternally oscillate\r\nbetween disgust and desire. For there is nothing ultimate in Hell; men\r\nwill not lay aside all hope on entering it, or they would attain to the\r\nsplendour of despair. To have made a poem about Hell is to mistake its\r\nvery essence; it is the imagination of men, who will have beauty, that\r\nfashions it as ice or flame. Old, but capable of growing older, Micky\r\nlay in the sandy country, remembering that once he had remembered a\r\ncountry--a country that had not been sand....\r\n\r\nHe was aroused by the mutterings of the spirits round him. An\r\nuneasiness such as he had not noted in them before had arisen. \"A\r\npillar of sand,\" said one. Another said, \"It is not; it comes from the\r\nriver.\"\r\n\r\nHe asked, \"What river?\"\r\n\r\n\"The spirits of the damned dwell over it; we never speak of that river.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it a broad river?\"\r\n\r\n\"Swift, and very broad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do the damned ever cross it?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are permitted, we know not why, to cross it now and again.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in these answers he caught a new tone, as if his companions were\r\nfrightened, and were finding means to express their fear. When he said,\r\n\"With permission, they can do us no harm,\" he was answered, \"They\r\nharm us with light and a song.\" And again, \"They harm us because they\r\nremember and try to remind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what would they remind us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the hour when we were as they.\"\r\n\r\nAs he questioned a whisper arose from the low-lying verges. The spirits\r\nwere crying to each other faintly. He heard, \"It is coming; drive\r\nit back over the river, shatter it, compel it to be old.\" And then\r\nthe darkness was cloven, and a star of pain broke in his soul. He\r\nunderstood now; a torment greater than any was at hand.\r\n\r\n\"I was before choice,\" came the song. \"I was before hardness and\r\nsoftness were divided. I was in the days when truth was love. And I am.\"\r\n\r\nAll the plain was convulsed. But the invader could not be shattered.\r\nWhen it pressed the air parted and the sand-pillars fell, and its path\r\nwas filled with senile weeping.\r\n\r\n\"I have been all men, but all men have forgotten me. I transfigured\r\nthe world for them until they preferred the world. They came to me as\r\nchildren, afraid; I taught them, and they despised me. Childhood is a\r\ndream about me, experience a slow forgetting: I govern the magic years\r\nbetween them, and am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why trouble us?\" moaned the shades. \"We could bear our torment, just\r\nbear it, until there was light and a song. Go back again over the\r\nriver. This is Heaven, we were saying, that darkness is God; we could\r\npraise them till you came. The book of our deeds is closed; why open\r\nit? We were damned from our birth; leave it there. O supreme jester,\r\nleave us. We have sinned, we know it, and this place is death and Hell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Death comes,\" the voice pealed, \"and death is not a dream or a\r\nforgetting. Death is real. But I, too, am real, and whom I will I save.\r\nI see the scheme of things, and in it no place for me, the brain and\r\nthe body against me. Therefore I rend the scheme in two, and make a\r\nplace, and under countless names have harrowed Hell. Come.\" Then, in\r\ntones of inexpressible sweetness, \"Come to me all who remember. Come\r\nout of your eternity into mine. It is easy, for I am still at your\r\neyes, waiting to look out of them; still in your hearts, waiting to\r\nbeat. The years that I dwelt with you seemed short, but they were\r\nmagical, and they outrun time.\"\r\n\r\nThe shades were silent. They could not remember.\r\n\r\n\"Who desires to remember? Desire is enough. There is no abiding home\r\nfor strength and beauty among men. The flower fades, the seas dry up in\r\nthe sun, the sun and all the stars fade as a flower. But the desire for\r\nsuch things, that is eternal, that can abide, and he who desires me is\r\nI.\"\r\n\r\nThen Micky died a second death. This time he dissolved through terrible\r\npain, scorched by the glare, pierced by the voice. But as he died he\r\nsaid, \"I do desire,\" and immediately the invader vanished, and he\r\nwas standing alone on the sandy plain. It had been merely a dream.\r\nBut he was standing. How was that? Why had he not thought to stand\r\nbefore? He had been unhappy in Hell, and all that he had to do was to\r\ngo elsewhere. He passed downwards, pained no longer by the mockery\r\nof its cloud. The pillars brushed against him and fell, the nether\r\ndarkness went over his head. On he went till he came to the banks of\r\nthe infernal stream, and there he stumbled--stumbled over a piece of\r\nwood, no vague substance, but a piece of wood that had once belonged\r\nto a tree. At his impact it moved, and water gurgled against it. He\r\nhad embarked. Some one was rowing. He could see the blades of oars\r\nmoving towards him through the foam, but the rower was invisible in\r\ncloud. As they neared mid-channel the boat went more slowly, for the\r\ntide was ebbing, and Micky knew that once carried out he would be\r\nlost eternally; there was no second hope of salvation. He could not\r\nspeak, but his heart beat time to the oars--one, two. Hell made her\r\nlast effort, and all that is evil in creation, all the distortions of\r\nlove and truth by which we are vexed, came surging down the estuary,\r\nand the boat hung motionless. Micky heard the pant of breath through\r\nthe roaring, the crack of angelic muscles; then he heard a voice say,\r\n\"The point of it ...\" and a weight fell off his body and he crossed\r\nmid-stream.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious evening. The boat had sped without prelude into\r\nsunshine. The sky was cloudless, the earth gold, and gulls were riding\r\nup and down on the furrowed waters. On the bank they had left were some\r\nsand-dunes rising to majestic hills; on the bank in front was a farm,\r\nfull to the brim with fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MR. ANDREWS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe souls of the dead were ascending towards the Judgment Seat and the\r\nGate of Heaven. The world soul pressed them on every side, just as the\r\natmosphere presses upon rising bubbles, striving to vanquish them, to\r\nbreak their thin envelope of personality, to mingle their virtue with\r\nits own. But they resisted, remembering their glorious individual life\r\non earth, and hoping for an individual life to come.\r\n\r\nAmong them ascended the soul of a Mr. Andrews who, after a beneficent\r\nand honourable life, had recently deceased at his house in town.\r\nHe knew himself to be kind, upright and religious, and though he\r\napproached his trial with all humility, he could not be doubtful of\r\nits result. God was not now a jealous God. He would not deny salvation\r\nmerely because it was expected. A righteous soul may reasonably be\r\nconscious of its own righteousness and Mr. Andrews was conscious of his.\r\n\r\n\"The way is long,\" said a voice, \"but by pleasant converse the way\r\nbecomes shorter. Might I travel in your company?\"\r\n\r\n\"Willingly,\" said Mr. Andrews. He held out his hand, and the two souls\r\nfloated upwards together.\r\n\r\n\"I was slain fighting the infidel,\" said the other exultantly, \"and I\r\ngo straight to those joys of which the Prophet speaks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you not a Christian?\" asked Mr. Andrews gravely.\r\n\r\n\"No, I am a Believer. But you are a Moslem, surely?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not,\" said Mr. Andrews. \"I am a Believer.\"\r\n\r\nThe two souls floated upwards in silence, but did not release each\r\nother's hands. \"I am broad church,\" he added gently. The word \"broad\"\r\nquavered strangely amid the interspaces.\r\n\r\n\"Relate to me your career,\" said the Turk at last.\r\n\r\n\"I was born of a decent middle-class family, and had my education at\r\nWinchester and Oxford. I thought of becoming a missionary, but was\r\noffered a post in the Board of Trade, which I accepted. At thirty-two I\r\nmarried, and had four children, two of whom have died. My wife survives\r\nme. If I had lived a little longer I should have been knighted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I will relate my career. I was never sure of my father, and my\r\nmother does not signify. I grew up in the slums of Salonika. Then I\r\njoined a band and we plundered the villages of the infidel. I prospered\r\nand had three wives, all of whom survive me. Had I lived a little\r\nlonger I should have had a band of my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"A son of mine was killed travelling in Macedonia. Perhaps you killed\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very possible.\"\r\n\r\nThe two souls floated upward, hand in hand. Mr. Andrews did not speak\r\nagain, for he was filled with horror at the approaching tragedy. This\r\nman, so godless, so lawless, so cruel, so lustful, believed that he\r\nwould be admitted into Heaven. And into what a heaven--a place full\r\nof the crude pleasures of a ruffian's life on earth! But Mr. Andrews\r\nfelt neither disgust nor moral indignation. He was only conscious of an\r\nimmense pity, and his own virtues confronted him not at all. He longed\r\nto save the man whose hand he held more tightly, who, he thought, was\r\nnow holding more tightly on to him. And when he reached the Gate of\r\nHeaven, instead of saying, \"Can I enter?\" as he had intended, he cried\r\nout, \"Cannot _he_ enter?\"\r\n\r\nAnd at the same moment the Turk uttered the same cry. For the same\r\nspirit was working in each of them.\r\n\r\nFrom the gateway a voice replied, \"Both can enter.\" They were filled\r\nwith joy and pressed forward together.\r\n\r\nThen the voice said, \"In what clothes will you enter?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my best clothes,\" shouted the Turk, \"the ones I stole.\" And he clad\r\nhimself in a splendid turban and a waistcoat embroidered with silver,\r\nand baggy trousers, and a great belt in which were stuck pipes and\r\npistols and knives.\r\n\r\n\"And in what clothes will you enter?\" said the voice to Mr. Andrews.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews thought of his best clothes, but he had no wish to wear\r\nthem again. At last he remembered and said, \"Robes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what colour and fashion?\" asked the voice.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews had never thought about the matter much. He replied, in\r\nhesitating tones, \"White, I suppose, of some flowing soft material,\"\r\nand he was immediately given a garment such as he had described. \"Do I\r\nwear it rightly?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Wear it as it pleases you,\" replied the voice. \"What else do you\r\ndesire?\"\r\n\r\n\"A harp,\" suggested Mr. Andrews. \"A small one.\"\r\n\r\nA small gold harp was placed in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"And a palm--no, I cannot have a palm, for it is the reward of\r\nmartyrdom; my life has been tranquil and happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can have a palm if you desire it.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Andrews refused the palm, and hurried in his white robes after\r\nthe Turk, who had already entered Heaven. As he passed in at the open\r\ngate, a man, dressed like himself, passed out with gestures of despair.\r\n\r\n\"Why is he not happy?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe voice did not reply.\r\n\r\n\"And who are all those figures, seated inside on thrones and mountains?\r\nWhy are some of them terrible, and sad, and ugly?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. Mr. Andrews entered, and then he saw that those\r\nseated figures were all the gods who were then being worshipped on the\r\nearth. A group of souls stood round each, singing his praises. But the\r\ngods paid no heed, for they were listening to the prayers of living\r\nmen, which alone brought them nourishment. Sometimes a faith would\r\ngrow weak, and then the god of that faith also drooped and dwindled\r\nand fainted for his daily portion of incense. And sometimes, owing to\r\na revivalist movement, or to a great commemoration, or to some other\r\ncause, a faith would grow strong, and the god of that faith grow strong\r\nalso. And, more frequently still, a faith would alter, so that the\r\nfeatures of its god altered and became contradictory, and passed from\r\necstasy to respectability, or from mildness and universal love to the\r\nferocity of battle. And at times a god would divide into two gods,\r\nor three, or more, each with his own ritual and precarious supply of\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews saw Buddha, and Vishnu, and Allah, and Jehovah, and the\r\nElohim. He saw little ugly determined gods who were worshipped by a\r\nfew savages in the same way. He saw the vast shadowy outlines of the\r\nneo-Pagan Zeus. There were cruel gods, and coarse gods, and tortured\r\ngods, and, worse still, there were gods who were peevish, or deceitful,\r\nor vulgar. No aspiration of humanity was unfulfilled. There was even\r\nan intermediate state for those who wished it, and for the Christian\r\nScientists a place where they could demonstrate that they had not died.\r\n\r\nHe did not play his harp for long, but hunted vainly for one of his\r\ndead friends. And though souls were continually entering Heaven, it\r\nstill seemed curiously empty. Though he had all that he expected, he\r\nwas conscious of no great happiness, no mystic contemplation of beauty,\r\nno mystic union with good. There was nothing to compare with that\r\nmoment outside the gate, when he prayed that the Turk might enter and\r\nheard the Turk uttering the same prayer for him. And when at last he\r\nsaw his companion, he hailed him with a cry of human joy.\r\n\r\nThe Turk was seated in thought, and round him, by sevens, sat the\r\nvirgins who are promised in the Koran.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear friend!\" he called out. \"Come here and we will never be\r\nparted, and such as my pleasures are, they shall be yours also. Where\r\nare my other friends? Where are the men whom I love, or whom I have\r\nkilled?\"\r\n\r\n\"I, too, have only found you,\" said Mr. Andrews. He sat down by the\r\nTurk, and the virgins, who were all exactly alike, ogled them with coal\r\nblack eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Though I have all that I expected,\" said the Turk, \"I am conscious\r\nof no great happiness. There is nothing to compare with that moment\r\noutside the gate when I prayed that you might enter, and heard you\r\nuttering the same prayer for me. These virgins are as beautiful and\r\ngood as I had fashioned, yet I could wish that they were better.\"\r\n\r\nAs he wished, the forms of the virgins became more rounded, and their\r\neyes grew larger and blacker than before. And Mr. Andrews, by a wish\r\nsimilar in kind, increased the purity and softness of his garment and\r\nthe glitter of his harp. For in that place their expectations were\r\nfulfilled, but not their hopes.\r\n\r\n\"I am going,\" said Mr. Andrews at last. \"We desire infinity and we\r\ncannot imagine it. How can we expect it to be granted? I have never\r\nimagined anything infinitely good or beautiful excepting in my dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going with you,\" said the other.\r\n\r\nTogether they sought the entrance gate, and the Turk parted with his\r\nvirgins and his best clothes, and Mr. Andrews cast away his robes and\r\nhis harp.\r\n\r\n\"Can we depart?\" they asked.\r\n\r\n\"You can both depart if you wish,\" said the voice, \"but remember what\r\nlies outside.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as they passed the gate, they felt again the pressure of\r\nthe world soul. For a moment they stood hand in hand resisting it.\r\nThen they suffered it to break in upon them, and they, and all the\r\nexperience they had gained, and all the love and wisdom they had\r\ngenerated, passed into it, and made it better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CO-ORDINATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Don't thump,\" said Miss Haddon. \"And each run ought to be like a\r\nstring of pearls. It is not. Why is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ellen, you beast, you've got my note.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I haven't. You've got mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, whose note is it?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Haddon looked between their pigtails. \"It is Mildred's note,\" she\r\ndecided. \"Go back to the double bars. And don't thump.\"\r\n\r\nThe girls went back, and again the little finger of Mildred's right\r\nhand disputed for middle G with the little finger of Ellen's left.\r\n\r\n\"It can't be done,\" they said. \"It's the man who wrote it's fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can easily be done if you don't hold on so long, Ellen,\" said Miss\r\nHaddon.\r\n\r\nFour o'clock struck. Mildred and Ellen went, and Rose and Enid\r\nsucceeded them. They played the duet worse than Mildred, but not\r\nas badly as Ellen. At four-fifteen Margaret and Jane came. They\r\nplayed worse than Rose and Enid, but not as badly as Ellen. At\r\nfour-thirty Dolores and Violet came. They played worse than Ellen.\r\nAt four-forty-five Miss Haddon went to tea with the Principal, who\r\nexplained why she desired all the pupils to learn the same duet.\r\nIt was part of her new co-ordinative system. The school was taking\r\none subject for the year, only one--Napoleon--and all the studies\r\nwere to bear on that one subject. Thus--not to mention French and\r\nHistory--the Repetition class was learning Wordsworth's political\r\npoems, the literature class was reading extracts from \"War and Peace,\"\r\nthe drawing class copied something of David's, the needlework class\r\ndesigned Empire gowns, and the music pupils--they, of course, were\r\npractising Beethoven's \"Eroica\" Symphony, which had been begun (though\r\nnot finished) in honour of the Emperor. Several of the other mistresses\r\nwere at tea, and they exclaimed that they loved co-ordinating, and\r\nthat it was a lovely system: it made work so much more interesting to\r\nthem as well as to the girls. But Miss Haddon did not respond. There\r\nhad been no co-ordination in her day, and she could not understand it.\r\nShe only knew that she was growing old, and teaching music worse and\r\nworse, and she wondered how soon the Principal would find this out and\r\ndismiss her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, high up in heaven Beethoven sat, and all around him,\r\nranged on smaller clouds, sat his clerks. Each made entries in a\r\nledger, and he whose ledger was entitled \"'Eroica' Symphony: arranged\r\nfor four hands, by Carl Müller,\" was making the following entries:\r\n\"3.45, Mildred and Ellen; conductor, Miss Haddon. 4.0, Rose and Enid;\r\nconductor, Miss Haddon. 4.15, Margaret and Jane; conductor, Miss\r\nHaddon. 4.30----\"\r\n\r\nBeethoven interrupted. \"Who is this Miss Haddon,\" he asked, \"whose name\r\nrecurs like the beat of a drum?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has interpreted you for many years.\"\r\n\r\n\"And her orchestra?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are maidens of the upper middle classes, who perform the 'Eroica'\r\nin her presence every day and all day. The sound of it never ceases. It\r\nfloats out of the window like a continual incense, and is heard up and\r\ndown the street.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they perform with insight?\"\r\n\r\nSince Beethoven is deaf, the clerk could reply, \"With most intimate\r\ninsight. There was a time when Ellen was further from your spirit than\r\nthe rest, but that has not been the case since Dolores and Violet\r\narrived.\"\r\n\r\n\"New comrades have inspired her. I understand.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk was silent.\r\n\r\n\"I approve,\" continued Beethoven, \"and in token of my approval I decree\r\nthat Miss Haddon and her orchestra and all in their house shall this\r\nvery evening hear a perfect performance of my A minor quartette.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the decree was being entered, and while the staff was wondering\r\nhow it would be executed, a scene of even greater splendour was taking\r\nplace in another part of the empyrean. There Napoleon sat, surrounded\r\nby his clerks, who were so numerous that the thrones of the outermost\r\nlooked no larger than cirro-cumuli clouds. They were busy entering all\r\nthe references made on earth to their employer, a task for which he\r\nhimself had organized them. Every few moments he asked, \"And what is\r\nour latest phase?\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk whose ledger was entitled \"Hommages de Wordsworth\" answered:\r\n\"5.0, Mildred, Ellen, Rose, Enid, Margaret and Jane, all recited the\r\nsonnet, 'Once did she hold the gorgeous East in fee.' Dolores and\r\nViolet attempted to recite it, but failed.\"\r\n\r\n\"The poet there celebrates my conquest of the Venetian Republic,\"\r\nsaid the Emperor, \"and the greatness of the theme overcame Violet and\r\nDolores. It is natural that they should fail. And the next phase?\"\r\n\r\nAnother clerk said, \"5.15, Mildred, Ellen, Rose, Enid, Margaret and\r\nJane, are sketching in the left front leg of Pauline Buonaparte's\r\ncouch. Dolores and Violet are still learning their sonnet.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said Napoleon, \"that I have heard these charming\r\nnames before.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are in my ledger, too,\" said a third clerk. \"You may remember,\r\nsire, that about an hour ago they performed Beethoven's 'Eroica'----\"\r\n\r\n\"Written in my honour,\" concluded the Emperor. \"I approve.\"\r\n\r\n\"5.30,\" said a fourth clerk, \"with the exception of Dolores and Violet,\r\nwho have been sent to sharpen pencils, the whole company sings the\r\n'Marseillaise.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It needed but that,\" cried Napoleon, rising to his feet. \"Ces\r\ndemoiselles ont un vrai élan vers la gloire. I decree in recompense\r\nthat they and all their house shall participate tomorrow morning in the\r\nvictory of Austerlitz.\"\r\n\r\nThe decree was entered.\r\n\r\nEvening prep. was at 7.30. The girls settled down gloomily, for they\r\nwere already bored to tears by the new system. But a wonderful thing\r\nhappened. A regiment of cavalry rode past the school, headed by the\r\nmost spiffing band. The girls went off their heads with joy. They\r\nrose from their seats, they sang, they advanced, they danced, they\r\npranced, they made trumpets out of paper and used the blackboard as a\r\nkettle-drum. They were able to do this because Miss Haddon, who ought\r\nto have been supervising, had left the room to find a genealogical tree\r\nof Marie Louise; the history mistress had asked her particularly to\r\ntake it to prep. for the girls to climb about in, but she had forgotten\r\nit. \"I am no good at all,\" thought Miss Haddon, as she stretched out\r\nher hand for the tree; it lay with some other papers under a shell\r\nwhich the Principal had procured from St. Helena. \"I am stupid and\r\ntired and old; I wish that I was dead.\" Thus thinking, she lifted the\r\nshell mechanically to her ear; her father, who was a sailor, had often\r\ndone the same to her when she was young....\r\n\r\nShe heard the sea; at first it was the tide whispering over mud-flats\r\nor chattering against stones, or the short, crisp break of a wave on\r\nsand, or the long, echoing roar of a wave against rocks, or the sounds\r\nof the central ocean, where the waters pile themselves into mountains\r\nand part into ravines; or when fog descends, and the deep rises and\r\nfalls gently; or when the air is so fresh that the big waves and the\r\nlittle waves that live in the big waves all sing for joy, and send one\r\nanother kisses of white foam. She heard them all, but in the end she\r\nheard the sea itself, and knew that it was hers for ever.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Haddon!\" said the Principal. \"Miss Haddon! How is it you are not\r\nsupervising the girls?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Haddon removed the shell from her ear, and faced her employer with\r\na growing determination.\r\n\r\n\"I can hear Ellen's voice though we are at the other side of the\r\nhouse,\" she continued. \"I half thought it was the elocution hour. Put\r\ndown that paper-weight at once, please, Miss Haddon, and return to your\r\nduties.\"\r\n\r\nShe took the shell from the music mistress's hand, intending to place\r\nit on its proper shelf. But the force of example caused her to raise it\r\nto her own ear. She, too, listened....\r\n\r\nShe heard the rustling of trees in a wood. It was no wood that she had\r\never known, but all the people she had known were riding about in it,\r\nand calling softly to each other on horns. It was night, and they were\r\nhunting. Now and then beasts rustled, and once there was an \"Halloo!\"\r\nand a chase, but more often her friends rode quietly, and she with\r\nthem, penetrating the wood in every direction and for ever.\r\n\r\nAnd while she heard this with one ear, Miss Haddon was speaking as\r\nfollows into the other:\r\n\r\n\"I will not return to my duties. I have neglected them ever since I\r\ncame here, and once more will make little difference. I am not musical.\r\nI have deceived the pupils and the parents and you. I am not musical,\r\nbut pretended that I was to make money. What will happen to me now I do\r\nnot know, but I can pretend no longer. I give notice.\"\r\n\r\nThe Principal was surprised to learn that her music mistress was not\r\nmusical; the sound of pianos had continued for so many years that\r\nshe had assumed all was well. In ordinary circumstances she would\r\nhave answered scathingly, for she was an accomplished woman, but the\r\nmurmuring forest caused her to reply, \"Oh, Miss Haddon, not now; let's\r\ntalk it over tomorrow morning. Now, if you will, I want you to lie down\r\nin my sitting-room while I take preparation instead, for it always\r\nrests me to be with the girls.\"\r\n\r\nSo Miss Haddon lay down, and as she dozed the soul of the sea returned\r\nto her. And the Principal, her head full of forest murmurs, went to the\r\npreparation-room, and gave her cough three times before she opened the\r\ndoor. All the girls were at their desks except Dolores and Violet, and\r\nthem she affected not to notice. After a time she went to fetch the\r\ntree of Marie Louise, which she had forgotten, and during her absence\r\nthe cavalry passed again....\r\n\r\nIn the morning Miss Haddon said, \"I still wish to go, but I wish I had\r\nwaited to speak to you. I have had some extraordinary news. Many years\r\nago my father saved a man from drowning. That man has just died, and he\r\nhas left me a cottage by the edge of the sea, and money to live in it.\r\nI need not work any more; so if only I had waited till today I could\r\nhave been more civil to you and\"--she blushed a little--\"to myself.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Principal shook her by both hands and kissed her. \"I am glad\r\nthat you did not wait,\" she said. \"What you said yesterday was a word\r\nof truth, a clear call through the thicket. I wish that I, too----\" She\r\nstopped. \"But the next step is to give the school a whole holiday.\"\r\n\r\nSo the girls were summoned, and the Principal made a speech, and\r\nMiss Haddon another, giving every one the address of the cottage,\r\nand inviting them to visit her at it. Then Rose was sent to the\r\npastrycook's for ices, and Enid to the greengrocer's for fruit, and\r\nMildred to the sweetshop for lemonade, and Jane to the livery stables\r\nfor brakes, and they all drove out an immense distance into the\r\ncountry, and played disorganized games. Every one hid and nobody\r\nsought; every one batted and nobody fielded; no one knew whose side she\r\nwas on, and no mistress tried to tell her; and it was even possible\r\nto play two games at once, and to be Clumps in one and Peter Pan in\r\nthe other. As for the co-ordinative system, it was never mentioned, or\r\nmentioned in derision. For example, Ellen composed a song against it,\r\nwhich ran:\r\n\r\n    Silly old Boney\r\n    Sat on his Pony,\r\n      Eating his Christmas Pie,\r\n    He put in his thumb\r\n    And pulled out a plum,\r\n      And said, \"What a good boy am I,\"\r\n\r\nand the smaller girls sang it without stopping for three hours.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day the Principal summoned the whole party round Miss\r\nHaddon and herself. She was ringed with happy, tired faces. The sun\r\nwas setting, the dust that the day had disturbed was sinking. \"Well,\r\ngirls,\" she said, laughing, but just a little shy, \"so you don't seem\r\nto value my co-ordinative system?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lauks, we don't!\" \"Not much!\" and so on, replied the girls.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must make a confession,\" the Principal continued. \"No more do\r\nI. In fact, I hate it. But I was obliged to take it up, because that\r\ntype of thing impresses the Board of Education.\"\r\n\r\nAt this all the mistresses and girls laughed and cheered, and Dolores\r\nand Violet, who thought that the Board of Education was a new round\r\ngame, laughed too.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow it may be readily imagined that this discreditable affair did not\r\nescape the attention of Mephistopheles. At the earliest opportunity\r\nhe sought the Judgment Seat, bearing an immense scroll inscribed\r\n\"J'accuse!\" Half-way up he met the angel Raphael, who asked him in his\r\ncourteous manner whether he could help him in any way.\r\n\r\n\"Not this time, thank you,\" Mephistopheles replied. \"I really have a\r\ncase now.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might be better to show it to me,\" suggested the archangel.\r\n\"It would be a pity to fly so far for nothing, and you had such a\r\ndisappointment over Job.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that was different.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then there was Faust; the verdict there was ultimately against\r\nyou, if I remember rightly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that was so different again. No, I am certain this time. I can\r\nprove the futility of genius. Great men think that they are understood,\r\nand are not; men think that they understand them, and do not.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you can prove that, you have indeed a case,\" said Raphael. \"For\r\nthis universe is supposed to rest on co-ordination, all creatures\r\nco-ordinating according to their powers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen. Charge one: Beethoven decrees that certain females shall\r\nhear a performance of his A minor quartette. They hear--some of them\r\na band, others a shell. Charge two: Napoleon decrees that the same\r\nshall participate in the victory of Austerlitz. Result--a legacy,\r\nfollowed by a school treat. Charge three: Females perform Beethoven.\r\nBeing deaf, and being served by dishonest clerks, he supposes they\r\nare performing him with insight. Charge four: To impress the Board of\r\nEducation, females study Napoleon. He is led to suppose that they are\r\nstudying him properly. I have other points, but these will suffice. The\r\ngenius and the ordinary man have never co-ordinated once since Abel was\r\nkilled by Cain.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now for your case,\" said Raphael, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\"My case?\" stammered Mephistopheles. \"Why, this is my case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, innocent devil,\" cried the other. \"Oh, candid if infernal soul.\r\nGo back to the earth and walk up and down it again. For these people\r\nhave co-ordinated, Mephistopheles. They have co-ordinated through the\r\ncentral sources of Melody and Victory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE STORY OF THE SIREN\r\n\r\n\r\nFew things have been more beautiful than my notebook on the\r\nDeist Controversy as it fell downward through the waters of the\r\nMediterranean. It dived, like a piece of black slate, but opened soon,\r\ndisclosing leaves of pale green, which quivered into blue. Now it had\r\nvanished, now it was a piece of magical india-rubber stretching out\r\nto infinity, now it was a book again, but bigger than the book of all\r\nknowledge. It grew more fantastic as it reached the bottom, where a\r\npuff of sand welcomed it and obscured it from view. But it reappeared,\r\nquite sane though a little tremulous, lying decently open on its back,\r\nwhile unseen fingers fidgeted among its leaves.\r\n\r\n\"It is such pity,\" said my aunt, \"that you will not finish your work\r\nin the hotel. Then you would be free to enjoy yourself and this would\r\nnever have happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of it but will change into something rich and strange,\"\r\nwarbled the chaplain, while his sister said, \"Why, it's gone in the\r\nwater!\" As for the boatmen, one of them laughed, while the other,\r\nwithout a word of warning, stood up and began to take his clothes off.\r\n\r\n\"Holy Moses,\" cried the Colonel. \"Is the fellow mad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thank him, dear,\" said my aunt: \"that is to say, tell him he is\r\nvery kind, but perhaps another time.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the same I do want my book back,\" I complained. \"It's for my\r\nFellowship Dissertation. There won't be much left of it by another\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have an idea,\" said some woman or other through her parasol. \"Let\r\nus leave this child of nature to dive for the book while we go on to\r\nthe other grotto. We can land him either on this rock or on the ledge\r\ninside, and he will be ready when we return.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea seemed good; and I improved it by saying I would be left\r\nbehind too, to lighten the boat. So the two of us were deposited\r\noutside the little grotto on a great sunlit rock that guarded the\r\nharmonies within. Let us call them blue, though they suggest rather the\r\nspirit of what is clean--cleanliness passed from the domestic to the\r\nsublime, the cleanliness of all the sea gathered together and radiating\r\nlight. The Blue Grotto at Capri contains only more blue water, not\r\nbluer water. That colour and that spirit are the heritage of every cave\r\nin the Mediterranean into which the sun can shine and the sea flow.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the boat left I realized how imprudent I had been to trust\r\nmyself on a sloping rock with an unknown Sicilian. With a jerk he\r\nbecame alive, seizing my arm and saying, \"Go to the end of the grotto,\r\nand I will show you something beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nHe made me jump off the rock on to the ledge over a dazzling crack of\r\nsea; he drew me away from the light till I was standing on the tiny\r\nbeach of sand which emerged like powdered turquoise at the farther end.\r\nThere he left me with his clothes, and returned swiftly to the summit\r\nof the entrance rock. For a moment he stood naked in the brilliant sun,\r\nlooking down at the spot where the book lay. Then he crossed himself,\r\nraised his hands above his head, and dived.\r\n\r\nIf the book was wonderful, the man is past all description. His effect\r\nwas that of a silver statue, alive beneath the sea, through whom life\r\nthrobbed in blue and green. Something infinitely happy, infinitely\r\nwise--but it was impossible that it should emerge from the depths\r\nsunburned and dripping, holding the notebook on the Deist Controversy\r\nbetween its teeth.\r\n\r\nA gratuity is generally expected by those who bathe. Whatever I\r\noffered, he was sure to want more, and I was disinclined for an\r\nargument in a place so beautiful and also so solitary. It was a relief\r\nthat he should say in conversational tones, \"In a place like this one\r\nmight see the Siren.\"\r\n\r\nI was delighted with him for thus falling into the key of his\r\nsurroundings. We had been left together in a magic world, apart from\r\nall the commonplaces that are called reality, a world of blue whose\r\nfloor was the sea and whose walls and roof of rock trembled with the\r\nsea's reflections. Here only the fantastic would be tolerable, and it\r\nwas in that spirit I echoed his words, \"One might easily see the Siren.\"\r\n\r\nHe watched me curiously while he dressed. I was parting the sticky\r\nleaves of the notebook as I sat on the sand.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" he said at last. \"You may have read the little book that was\r\nprinted last year. Who would have thought that our Siren would have\r\ngiven the foreigners pleasure!\"\r\n\r\n(I read it afterwards. Its account is, not unnaturally, incomplete, in\r\nspite of there being a woodcut of the young person, and the words of\r\nher song.)\r\n\r\n\"She comes out of this blue water, doesn't she,\" I suggested, \"and sits\r\non the rock at the entrance, combing her hair.\"\r\n\r\nI wanted to draw him out, for I was interested in his sudden gravity,\r\nand there was a suggestion of irony in his last remark that puzzled me.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever seen her?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Often and often.\"\r\n\r\n\"I, never.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have heard her sing?\"\r\n\r\nHe put on his coat and said impatiently, \"How can she sing under the\r\nwater? Who could? She sometimes tries, but nothing comes from her but\r\ngreat bubbles.\"\r\n\r\n\"She should climb on to the rock.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can she?\" he cried again, quite angry. \"The priests have blessed\r\nthe air, so she cannot breathe it, and blessed the rocks, so that she\r\ncannot sit on them. But the sea no man can bless, because it is too\r\nbig, and always changing. So she lives in the sea.\"\r\n\r\nI was silent.\r\n\r\nAt this his face took a gentler expression. He looked at me as though\r\nsomething was on his mind, and going out to the entrance rock gazed at\r\nthe external blue. Then returning into our twilight he said, \"As a rule\r\nonly good people see the Siren.\"\r\n\r\nI made no comment. There was a pause, and he continued. \"That is a very\r\nstrange thing, and the priests do not know how to account for it, for\r\nshe of course is wicked. Not only those who fast and go to Mass are in\r\ndanger, but even those who are merely good in daily life. No one in\r\nthe village had seen her for two generations. I am not surprised. We\r\nall cross ourselves before we enter the water, but it is unnecessary.\r\nGiuseppe, we thought, was safer than most. We loved him, and many of us\r\nhe loved: but that is a different thing from being good.\"\r\n\r\nI asked who Giuseppe was.\r\n\r\n\"That day--I was seventeen and my brother was twenty and a great deal\r\nstronger than I was, and it was the year when the visitors, who have\r\nbrought such prosperity and so many alterations into the village, first\r\nbegan to come. One English lady in particular, of very high birth,\r\ncame, and has written a book about the place, and it was through her\r\nthat the Improvement Syndicate was formed, which is about to connect\r\nthe hotels with the station by a funicular railway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't tell me about that lady in here,\" I observed.\r\n\r\n\"That day we took her and her friends to see the grottoes. As we rowed\r\nclose under the cliffs I put out my hand, as one does, and caught a\r\nlittle crab, and having pulled off its claws offered it as a curiosity.\r\nThe ladies groaned, but a gentleman was pleased, and held out money.\r\nBeing inexperienced, I refused it, saying that his pleasure was\r\nsufficient reward! Giuseppe, who was rowing behind, was very angry with\r\nme and reached out with his hand and hit me on the side of the mouth,\r\nso that a tooth cut my lip, and I bled. I tried to hit him back, but\r\nhe always was too quick for me, and as I stretched round he kicked me\r\nunder the armpit, so that for a moment I could not even row. There was\r\na great noise among the ladies, and I heard afterward that they were\r\nplanning to take me away from my brother and train me as a waiter.\r\nThat, at all events, never came to pass.\r\n\r\n\"When we reached the grotto--not here, but a larger one--the gentleman\r\nwas very anxious that one of us should dive for money, and the ladies\r\nconsented, as they sometimes do. Giuseppe, who had discovered how much\r\npleasure it gives foreigners to see us in the water, refused to dive\r\nfor anything but silver, and the gentleman threw in a two-lira piece.\r\n\r\n\"Just before my brother sprang off he caught sight of me holding my\r\nbruise, and crying, for I could not help it. He laughed and said, 'This\r\ntime, at all events, I shall not see the Siren!' and went into the\r\nwater without crossing himself. But he saw her.\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off and accepted a cigarette. I watched the golden entrance\r\nrock and the quivering walls and the magic water through which great\r\nbubbles constantly rose.\r\n\r\nAt last he dropped his hot ash into the ripples and turned his head\r\naway, and said, \"He came up without the coin. We pulled him into the\r\nboat, and he was so large that he seemed to fill it, and so wet that\r\nwe could not dress him. I have never seen a man so wet. I and the\r\ngentleman rowed back, and we covered Giuseppe with sacking and propped\r\nhim up in the stern.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was drowned, then?\" I murmured, supposing that to be the point.\r\n\r\n\"He was not,\" he cried angrily. \"He saw the Siren. I told you.\"\r\n\r\nI was silenced again.\r\n\r\n\"We put him to bed, though he was not ill. The doctor came, and took\r\nmoney, and the priest came and spattered him with holy water. But it\r\nwas no good. He was too big--like a piece of the sea. He kissed the\r\nthumb-bones of San Biagio and they never dried till evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he look like?\" I ventured.\r\n\r\n\"Like any one who has seen the Siren. If you have seen her 'often and\r\noften' how is it you do not know? Unhappy, unhappy because he knew\r\neverything. Every living thing made him unhappy because he knew it\r\nwould die. And all he cared to do was sleep.\"\r\n\r\nI bent over my notebook.\r\n\r\n\"He did no work, he forgot to eat, he forgot whether he had his clothes\r\non. All the work fell on me, and my sister had to go out to service. We\r\ntried to make him into a beggar, but he was too robust to inspire pity,\r\nand as for an idiot, he had not the right look in his eyes. He would\r\nstand in the street looking at people, and the more he looked at them\r\nthe more unhappy he became. When a child was born he would cover his\r\nface with his hands. If any one was married--he was terrible then, and\r\nwould frighten them as they came out of church. Who would have believed\r\nhe would marry himself! I caused that, I. I was reading out of the\r\npaper how a girl at Ragusa had 'gone mad through bathing in the sea.'\r\nGiuseppe got up, and in a week he and that girl came in.\r\n\r\n\"He never told me anything, but it seems that he went straight to her\r\nhouse, broke into her room, and carried her off. She was the daughter\r\nof a rich mineowner, so you may imagine our peril. Her father came\r\ndown, with a clever lawyer, but they could do no more than I. They\r\nargued and they threatened, but at last they had to go back and we\r\nlost nothing--that is to say, no money. We took Giuseppe and Maria to\r\nthe church and had them married. Ugh! that wedding! The priest made no\r\njokes afterward, and coming out the children threw stones.... I think I\r\nwould have died to make her happy; but as always happens, one could do\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were they unhappy together then?\"\r\n\r\n\"They loved each other, but love is not happiness. We can all get love.\r\nLove is nothing. I had two people to work for now, for she was like\r\nhim in everything--one never knew which of them was speaking. I had to\r\nsell our own boat and work under the bad old man you have today. Worst\r\nof all, people began to hate us. The children first--everything begins\r\nwith them--and then the women and last of all the men. For the cause of\r\nevery misfortune was--You will not betray me?\"\r\n\r\nI promised good faith, and immediately he burst into the frantic\r\nblasphemy of one who has escaped from supervision, cursing the priests,\r\nwho had ruined his life, he said. \"Thus are we tricked!\" was his cry,\r\nand he stood up and kicked at the azure ripples with his feet, till he\r\nhad obscured them with a cloud of sand.\r\n\r\nI too was moved. The story of Giuseppe, for all its absurdity and\r\nsuperstition, came nearer to reality than anything I had known before.\r\nI don't know why, but it filled me with desire to help others--the\r\ngreatest of all our desires, I suppose, and the most fruitless. The\r\ndesire soon passed.\r\n\r\n\"She was about to have a child. That was the end of everything. People\r\nsaid to me, 'When will your charming nephew be born? What a cheerful,\r\nattractive child he will be, with such a father and mother!' I kept my\r\nface steady and replied, 'I think he may be. Out of sadness shall come\r\ngladness'--it is one of our proverbs. And my answer frightened them\r\nvery much, and they told the priests, who were frightened too. Then the\r\nwhisper started that the child would be Antichrist. You need not be\r\nafraid: he was never born.\r\n\r\n\"An old witch began to prophesy, and no one stopped her. Giuseppe and\r\nthe girl, she said, had silent devils, who could do little harm. But\r\nthe child would always be speaking and laughing and perverting, and\r\nlast of all he would go into the sea and fetch up the Siren into the\r\nair and all the world would see her and hear her sing. As soon as\r\nshe sang, the Seven Vials would be opened and the Pope would die and\r\nMongibello flame, and the veil of Santa Agata would be burned. Then the\r\nboy and the Siren would marry, and together they would rule the world,\r\nfor ever and ever.\r\n\r\n\"The whole village was in tumult, and the hotel-keepers became alarmed,\r\nfor the tourist season was just beginning. They met together and\r\ndecided that Giuseppe and the girl must be sent inland until the child\r\nwas born, and they subscribed the money. The night before they were\r\nto start there was a full moon and wind from the east, and all along\r\nthe coast the sea shot up over the cliffs in silver clouds. It is a\r\nwonderful sight, and Maria said she must see it once more.\r\n\r\n\"'Do not go,' I said. 'I saw the priest go by, and some one with him.\r\nAnd the hotel-keepers do not like you to be seen, and if we displease\r\nthem also we shall starve.'\r\n\r\n\"'I want to go,' she replied. 'The sea is stormy, and I may never feel\r\nit again.'\r\n\r\n\"'No, he is right,' said Giuseppe. 'Do not go--or let one of us go with\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n\"'I want to go alone,' she said; and she went alone.\r\n\r\n\"I tied up their luggage in a piece of cloth, and then I was so unhappy\r\nat thinking I should lose them that I went and sat down by my brother\r\nand put my arm round his neck, and he put his arm round me, which\r\nhe had not done for more than a year, and we remained thus I don't\r\nremember how long.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly the door flew open and moonlight and wind came in together,\r\nand a child's voice said laughing, 'They have pushed her over the\r\ncliffs into the sea.'\r\n\r\n\"I stepped to the drawer where I keep my knives.\r\n\r\n\"'Sit down again,' said Giuseppe--Giuseppe of all people! 'If she is\r\ndead, why should others die too?'\r\n\r\n\"'I guess who it is,' I cried, 'and I will kill him.'\r\n\r\n\"I was almost out of the door, and he tripped me up and, kneeling upon\r\nme, took hold of both my hands and sprained my wrists; first my right\r\none, then my left. No one but Giuseppe would have thought of such a\r\nthing. It hurt more than you would suppose, and I fainted. When I woke\r\nup, he was gone, and I never saw him again.\"\r\n\r\nBut Giuseppe disgusted me.\r\n\r\n\"I told you he was wicked,\" he said. \"No one would have expected him to\r\nsee the Siren.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know he did see her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he did not see her 'often and often,' but once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you love him if he is wicked?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed for the first time. That was his only reply.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the end?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I never killed her murderer, for by the time my wrists were well he\r\nwas in America; and one cannot kill a priest. As for Giuseppe, he went\r\nall over the world too, looking for some one else who had seen the\r\nSiren--either a man, or, better still, a woman, for then the child\r\nmight still have been born. At last he came to Liverpool--is the\r\ndistrict probable?--and there he began to cough, and spat blood until\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\n\"I do not suppose there is any one living now who has seen her. There\r\nhas seldom been more than one in a generation, and never in my life\r\nwill there be both a man and a woman from whom that child can be born,\r\nwho will fetch up the Siren from the sea, and destroy silence, and save\r\nthe world!\"\r\n\r\n\"Save the world?\" I cried. \"Did the prophecy end like that?\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned back against the rock, breathing deep. Through all the\r\nblue-green reflections I saw him colour. I heard him say: \"Silence and\r\nloneliness cannot last for ever. It may be a hundred or a thousand\r\nyears, but the sea lasts longer, and she shall come out of it and\r\nsing.\" I would have asked him more, but at that moment the whole cave\r\ndarkened, and there rode in through its narrow entrance the returning\r\nboat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE ETERNAL MOMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that mountain just behind Elizabeth's toque? A young man\r\nfell in love with me there so nicely twenty years ago. Bob your head a\r\nminute, would you, Elizabeth, kindly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm,\" said Elizabeth, falling forward on the box like an unstiffened\r\ndoll. Colonel Leyland put on his pince-nez, and looked at the mountain\r\nwhere the young man had fallen in love.\r\n\r\n\"Was he a nice young man?\" he asked, smiling, though he lowered his\r\nvoice a little on account of the maid.\r\n\r\n\"I never knew. But it is a very gratifying incident to remember at my\r\nage. Thank you, Elizabeth.\"\r\n\r\n\"May one ask who he was?\"\r\n\r\n\"A porter,\" answered Miss Raby in her usual tones. \"Not even a\r\ncertificated guide. A male person who was hired to carry the luggage,\r\nwhich he dropped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! well! What did you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"What a young lady should. Screamed and thanked him not to insult me.\r\nRan, which was quite unnecessary, fell, sprained my ankle, screamed\r\nagain; and he had to carry me half a mile, so penitent that I thought\r\nhe would fling me over a precipice. In that state we reached a certain\r\nMrs. Harbottle, at sight of whom I burst into tears. But she was so\r\nmuch stupider than I was, that I recovered quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you said it was all your own fault?\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust I did,\" she said more seriously. \"Mrs. Harbottle, who, like\r\nmost people, was always right, had warned me against him; we had had\r\nhim for expeditions before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt whether you do. Hitherto he had known his place. But he was\r\ntoo cheap: he gave us more than our money's worth. That, as you know,\r\nis an ominous sign in a low-born person.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how was this your fault?\"\r\n\r\n\"I encouraged him: I greatly preferred him to Mrs. Harbottle. He was\r\nhandsome and what I call agreeable; and he wore beautiful clothes.\r\nWe lagged behind, and he picked me flowers. I held out my hand for\r\nthem--instead of which he seized it and delivered a love oration which\r\nhe had prepared out of _I Promessi Sposi_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! an Italian.\"\r\n\r\nThey were crossing the frontier at that moment. On a little bridge amid\r\nfir trees were two poles, one painted red, white and green, and the\r\nother black and yellow.\r\n\r\n\"He lived in Italia Irredenta,\" said Miss Raby. \"But we were to fly to\r\nthe Kingdom. I wonder what would have happened if we had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" said Colonel Leyland, in sudden disgust. On the box\r\nElizabeth trembled.\r\n\r\n\"But it might have been a most successful match.\"\r\n\r\nShe was in the habit of talking in this mildly unconventional way.\r\nColonel Leyland, who made allowances for her brilliancy, managed to\r\nexclaim: \"Rather! yes, rather!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned on him with: \"Do you think I'm laughing at him?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked a little bewildered, smiled, and did not reply. Their\r\ncarriage was now crawling round the base of the notorious mountain.\r\nThe road was built over the debris which had fallen and which still\r\nfell from its sides; and it had scarred the pine woods with devastating\r\nrivers of white stone. But farther up, Miss Raby remembered, on its\r\ngentler eastern slope, it possessed tranquil hollows, and flower-clad\r\nrocks, and a most tremendous view. She had not been quite as facetious\r\nas her companion supposed. The incident, certainly, had been ludicrous.\r\nBut she was somehow able to laugh at it without laughing much at the\r\nactors or the stage.\r\n\r\n\"I had rather he made me a fool than that I thought he was one,\" she\r\nsaid, after a long pause.\r\n\r\n\"Here is the Custom House,\" said Colonel Leyland, changing the subject.\r\n\r\nThey had come to the land of _Ach_ and _Ja_. Miss Raby sighed; for she\r\nloved the Latins, as every one must who is not pressed for time. But\r\nColonel Leyland, a military man, respected Teutonia.\r\n\r\n\"They still talk Italian for seven miles,\" she said, comforting herself\r\nlike a child.\r\n\r\n\"German is the coming language,\" answered Colonel Leyland. \"All the\r\nimportant books on any subject are written in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But all the books on any important subject are written in Italian.\r\nElizabeth--tell me an important subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Human Nature, ma'am,\" said the maid, half shy, half impertinent.\r\n\r\n\"Elizabeth is a novelist, like her mistress,\" said Colonel Leyland. He\r\nturned away to look at the scenery, for he did not like being entangled\r\nin a mixed conversation. He noted that the farms were more prosperous,\r\nthat begging had stopped, that the women were uglier and the men more\r\nrotund, that more nourishing food was being eaten outside the wayside\r\ninns.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Leyland, shall we go to the _Grand Hôtel des Alpes_, to\r\nthe _Hôtel de Londres_, to the _Pension Liebig_, to the _Pension\r\nAtherley-Simon_, to the _Pension Belle Vue_, to the _Pension\r\nOld-England_, or to the _Albergo Biscione_?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you would prefer the _Biscione_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I really shouldn't mind the _Grand Hôtel des Alpes_. The _Biscione_\r\npeople own both, I hear. They have become quite rich.\"\r\n\r\n\"You should have a splendid reception--if such people know what\r\ngratitude is.\"\r\n\r\nFor Miss Raby's novel, \"The Eternal Moment,\" which had made her\r\nreputation, had also made the reputation of Vorta.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I was properly thanked. Signor Cantù wrote to me about three years\r\nafter I had published. The letter struck me as a little pathetic,\r\nthough it was very prosperous: I don't like transfiguring people's\r\nlives. I wonder whether they live in their old house or in the new one.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Leyland had come to Vorta to be with Miss Raby; but he was\r\nvery willing that they should be in different hotels. She, indifferent\r\nto such subtleties, saw no reason why they should not stop under the\r\nsame roof, just as she could not see why they should not travel in the\r\nsame carriage. On the other hand, she hated anything smart. He had\r\ndecided on the _Grand Hôtel des Alpes_, and she was drifting towards\r\nthe _Biscione_, when the tiresome Elizabeth said: \"My friend's lady is\r\nstaying at the _Alpes_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! if Elizabeth's friend is there that settles it: we'll all go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well'm,\" said Elizabeth, studiously avoiding even the appearance\r\nof gratitude. Colonel Leyland's face grew severe over the want of\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\n\"You spoil her,\" he murmured, when they had all descended to walk up a\r\nhill.\r\n\r\n\"There speaks the military man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I have had too much to do with Tommies to enter into what\r\nyou call 'human relations.' A little sentimentality, and the whole army\r\nwould go to pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know; but the whole world isn't an army. So why should I pretend\r\nI'm an officer. You remind me of my Anglo-Indian friends, who were so\r\nshocked when I would be pleasant to some natives. They proved, quite\r\nconclusively, that it would never do for them, and have never seen that\r\nthe proof didn't apply. The unlucky people here are always trying to\r\nlead the lucky; and it must be stopped. You've been unlucky: all your\r\nlife you've had to command men, and exact prompt obedience and other\r\nunprofitable virtues. I'm lucky: I needn't do the same--and I won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't then,\" he said, smiling. \"But take care that the world isn't an\r\narmy after all. And take care, besides, that you aren't being unjust to\r\nthe unlucky people: we're fairly kind to your beloved lower orders, for\r\ninstance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" she said dreamily, as if he had made her no concession.\r\n\"It's becoming usual. But they see through it. They, like ourselves,\r\nknow that only one thing in the world is worth having.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! yes,\" he sighed. \"It's a commercial age.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" exclaimed Miss Raby, so irritably that Elizabeth looked back to\r\nsee what was wrong. \"You are stupid. Kindness and money are both quite\r\neasy to part with. The only thing worth giving away is yourself. Did\r\nyou ever give yourself away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Frequently.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, did you ever, intentionally, make a fool of yourself before\r\nyour inferiors?\"\r\n\r\n\"Intentionally, never.\" He saw at last what she was driving at. It was\r\nher pleasure to pretend that such self-exposure was the only possible\r\nbasis of true intercourse, the only gate in the spiritual barrier\r\nthat divided class from class. One of her books had dealt with the\r\nsubject; and very agreeable reading it made. \"What about you?\" he added\r\nplayfully.\r\n\r\n\"I've never done it properly. Hitherto I've never felt a really big\r\nfool; but when I do, I hope I shall show it plainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I be there!\"\r\n\r\n\"You might not like it,\" she replied. \"I may feel it at any moment and\r\nin mixed company. Anything might set me off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Behold Vorta!\" cried the driver, cutting short the sprightly\r\nconversation. He and Elizabeth and the carriage had reached the top of\r\nthe hill. The black woods ceased; and they emerged into a valley whose\r\nsides were emerald lawns, rippling and doubling and merging each into\r\neach, yet always with an upward trend, so that it was 2000 feet to\r\nwhere the rock burst out of the grass and made great mountains, whose\r\npinnacles were delicate in the purity of evening.\r\n\r\nThe driver, who had the gift of repetition, said: \"Vorta! Vorta!\"\r\n\r\nFar up the valley was a large white village, tossing on undulating\r\nmeadows like a ship in the sea, and at its prow, breasting a sharp\r\nincline, stood a majestic tower of new grey stone. As they looked at\r\nthe tower it became vocal and spoke magnificently to the mountains, who\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\nThey were again informed that this was Vorta, and that that was the\r\nnew campanile--like the campanile of Venice, only finer--and that the\r\nsound was the sound of the campanile's new bell.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you; exactly,\" said Colonel Leyland, while Miss Raby rejoiced\r\nthat the village had made such use of its prosperity. She had feared to\r\nreturn to the place she had once loved so well, lest she should find\r\nsomething new. It had never occurred to her that the new thing might be\r\nbeautiful. The architect had indeed gone south for his inspiration, and\r\nthe tower which stood among the mountains was akin to the tower which\r\nhad once stood beside the lagoons. But the birthplace of the bell it\r\nwas impossible to determine, for there is no nationality in sound.\r\n\r\nThey drove forward into the lovely scene, pleased and silent. Approving\r\ntourists took them for a well-matched couple. There was indeed nothing\r\noffensively literary in Miss Raby's kind angular face; and Colonel\r\nLeyland's profession had made him neat rather than aggressive. They\r\ndid very well for a cultured and refined husband and wife, who had\r\nspent their lives admiring the beautiful things with which the world is\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nAs they approached, other churches, hitherto unnoticed, replied--tiny\r\nchurches, ugly churches, churches painted pink with towers like\r\npumpkins, churches painted white with shingle spires, churches hidden\r\naltogether in the glades of a wood or the folds of a meadow--till the\r\nevening air was full of little voices, with the great voice singing in\r\ntheir midst. Only the English church, lately built in the Early English\r\nstyle, kept chaste silence.\r\n\r\nThe bells ceased, and all the little churches receded into darkness.\r\nInstead, there was a sound of dressing-gongs, and a vision of\r\ntired tourists hurrying back for dinner. A landau, with _Pension\r\nAtherly-Simon_ upon it, was trotting to meet the diligence, which was\r\njust due. A lady was talking to her mother about an evening dress.\r\nYoung men with rackets were talking to young men with alpenstocks.\r\nThen, across the darkness, a fiery finger wrote _Grand Hôtel des\r\nAlpes_.\r\n\r\n\"Behold the electric light!\" said the driver, hearing his passengers\r\nexclaim.\r\n\r\n_Pension Belle Vue_ started out against a pine-wood, and from the\r\nbrink of the river the _Hôtel de Londres_ replied. _Pensions Liebig_\r\nand _Lorelei_ were announced in green and amber respectively. The\r\n_Old-England_ appeared in scarlet. The illuminations covered a large\r\narea, for the best hotels stood outside the village, in elevated or\r\nromantic situations. This display took place every evening in the\r\nseason, but only while the diligence arrived. As soon as the last\r\ntourist was suited, the lights went out, and the hotel-keepers, cursing\r\nor rejoicing, retired to their cigars.\r\n\r\n\"Horrible!\" said Miss Raby.\r\n\r\n\"Horrible people!\" said Colonel Leyland.\r\n\r\nThe _Hôtel des Alpes_ was an enormous building, which, being made of\r\nwood, suggested a distended chalet. But this impression was corrected\r\nby a costly and magnificent view-terrace, the squared stones of which\r\nwere visible for miles, and from which, as from some great reservoir,\r\nasphalt paths trickled over the adjacent country. Their carriage,\r\nhaving ascended a private drive, drew up under a vaulted portico of\r\npitch-pine, which opened on to this terrace on one side, and into the\r\ncovered lounge on the other. There was a whirl of officials--men with\r\ngold braid, smarter men with more gold braid, men smarter still with\r\nno gold braid. Elizabeth assumed an arrogant air, and carried a small\r\nstraw basket with difficulty. Colonel Leyland became every inch a\r\nsoldier. Miss Raby, whom, in spite of long experience, a large hotel\r\nalways flustered, was hurried into an expensive bedroom, and advised to\r\ndress herself immediately if she wished to partake of table d'hôte.\r\n\r\nAs she came up the staircase, she had seen the dining-room filling with\r\nEnglish and Americans and with rich, hungry Germans. She liked company,\r\nbut tonight she was curiously depressed. She seemed to be confronted\r\nwith an unpleasing vision, the outlines of which were still obscure.\r\n\r\n\"I will eat in my room,\" she told Elizabeth. \"Go to your dinner: I'll\r\ndo the unpacking.\"\r\n\r\nShe wandered round, looking at the list of rules, the list of prices,\r\nthe list of excursions, the red plush sofa, the jugs and basins on\r\nwhich was lithographed a view of the mountains. Where amid such\r\nsplendour was there a place for Signor Cantù with his china-bowled\r\npipe, and for Signora Cantù with her snuff-coloured shawl?\r\n\r\nWhen the waiter at last brought up her dinner, she asked after her host\r\nand hostess.\r\n\r\nHe replied, in cosmopolitan English, that they were both well.\r\n\r\n\"Do they live here, or at the _Biscione_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, why yes. Only poor tourists go the _Biscione_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who lives there, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The mother of Signor Cantù. She is unconnected,\" he continued, like\r\none who has learnt a lesson, \"she is unconnected absolutely with us.\r\nFifteen years back, yes. But now, where is the _Biscione_? I beg you\r\ncontradict if we are spoken about together.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Raby said quietly: \"I have made a mistake. Would you kindly give\r\nnotice that I shall not want my room, and say that the luggage is to be\r\ntaken, immediately, to the _Biscione_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly! certainly!\" said the waiter, who was well trained. He added\r\nwith a vicious snort, \"You will have to pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Miss Raby.\r\n\r\nThe elaborate machinery which had so recently sucked her in began to\r\ndisgorge her. The trunks were carried down, the vehicle in which she\r\nhad arrived was recalled. Elizabeth, white with indignation, appeared\r\nin the hall. She paid for beds in which they had not slept, and for\r\nfood which they had never eaten. Amidst the whirl of gold-laced\r\nofficials, who hoped even in that space of time to have established\r\na claim to be tipped, she moved towards the door. The guests in the\r\nlounge observed her with amusement, concluding that she had found the\r\nhotel too dear.\r\n\r\n\"What is it? Whatever is it? Are you not comfortable?\" Colonel Leyland\r\nin his evening dress ran after her.\r\n\r\n\"Not that; I've made a mistake. This hotel belongs to the son; I must\r\ngo to the _Biscione_. He's quarrelled with the old people: I think the\r\nfather's dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"But really--if you are comfortable here----\"\r\n\r\n\"I must find out tonight whether it is true. And I must also\"--her\r\nvoice quivered--\"find out whether it is my fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"How in the name of goodness----\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall bear it if it is,\" she continued gently. \"I am too old to be a\r\ntragedy queen as well as an evil genius.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does she mean? Whatever does she mean?\" he murmured, as he\r\nwatched the carriage lights descending the hill. \"What harm has she\r\ndone? What harm is there for that matter? Hotel-keepers always quarrel:\r\nit's no business of ours.\" He ate a good dinner in silence. Then his\r\nthoughts were turned by the arrival of his letters from the post office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"DEAREST EDWIN,--It is with the greatest diffidence that I write to\r\n    you, and I know you will believe me when I say that I do not write\r\n    from curiosity. I only require an answer to one plain question. Are\r\n    you engaged to Miss Raby or no? Fashions have altered even since my\r\n    young days. But, for all that an engagement is still an engagement,\r\n    and should be announced at once, to save all parties discomfort.\r\n    Though your health has broken down and you have abandoned your\r\n    profession, you can still protect the family honour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Drivel!\" exclaimed Colonel Leyland. Acquaintance with Miss Raby had\r\nmade his sight keener. He recognized in this part of his sister's\r\nletter nothing but an automatic conventionality. He was no more moved\r\nby its perusal than she had been by its composition.\r\n\r\n    \"As for the maid whom the Bannons mentioned to me, she is not a\r\n    chaperone--nothing but a sop to throw in the eyes of the world.\r\n    I am not saying a word against Miss Raby, whose books we always\r\n    read. Literary people are always unpractical, and we are confident\r\n    that she does not know. Perhaps I do not think her the wife for\r\n    you; but that is another matter.\r\n\r\n    \"My babes, who all send love (so does Lionel), are at present an\r\n    unmitigated joy. One's only anxiety is for the future, when the\r\n    crushing expenses of good education will have to be taken into\r\n    account.\r\n\r\n                                                   \"Your loving NELLY.\"\r\n\r\nHow could he explain the peculiar charm of the relations between\r\nhimself and Miss Raby? There had never been a word of marriage, and\r\nwould probably never be a word of love. If, instead of seeing each\r\nother frequently, they should come to see each other always it would\r\nbe as sage companions, familiar with life, not as egoistic lovers,\r\ncraving for infinities of passion which they had no right to demand and\r\nno power to supply. Neither professed to be a virgin soul, or to be\r\nignorant of the other's limitations and inconsistencies. They scarcely\r\neven made allowances for each other. Toleration implies reserve; and\r\nthe greatest safeguard of unruffled intercourse is knowledge. Colonel\r\nLeyland had courage of no mean order: he cared little for the opinion\r\nof people whom he understood. Nelly and Lionel and their babes were\r\nwelcome to be shocked or displeased. Miss Raby was an authoress, a kind\r\nof radical; he a soldier, a kind of aristocrat. But the time for their\r\nactivities was passing; he was ceasing to fight, she to write. They\r\ncould pleasantly spend together their autumn. Nor might they prove the\r\nworst companions for a winter.\r\n\r\nHe was too delicate to admit, even to himself, the desirability of\r\nmarrying two thousand a year. But it lent an unacknowledged perfume to\r\nhis thoughts. He tore Nelly's letter into little pieces, and dropped\r\nthem into the darkness out of the bedroom window.\r\n\r\n\"Funny lady!\" he murmured, as he looked towards Vorta, trying to detect\r\nthe campanile in the growing light of the moon. \"Why have you gone to\r\nbe uncomfortable? Why will you interfere in the quarrels of people who\r\ncan't understand you, and whom you don't understand? How silly you are\r\nto think you've caused them. You think you've written a book which has\r\nspoilt the place and made the inhabitants corrupt and sordid. I know\r\njust how you think. So you will make yourself unhappy, and go about\r\ntrying to put right what never was right. Funny lady!\"\r\n\r\nClose below him he could now see the white fragments of his sister's\r\nletter. In the valley the campanile appeared, rising out of wisps of\r\nsilvery vapour.\r\n\r\n\"Dear lady!\" he whispered, making towards the village a little movement\r\nwith his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nMiss Raby's first novel, \"The Eternal Moment,\" was written round the\r\nidea that man does not live by time alone, that an evening gone may\r\nbecome like a thousand ages in the courts of heaven--the idea that was\r\nafterwards expounded more philosophically by Maeterlinck. She herself\r\nnow declared that it was a tiresome, affected book, and that the title\r\nsuggested the dentist's chair. But she had written it when she was\r\nfeeling young and happy; and that, rather than maturity, is the hour in\r\nwhich to formulate a creed. As years pass, the conception may become\r\nmore solid, but the desire and the power to impart it to others are\r\nalike weakened. It did not altogether displease her that her earliest\r\nwork had been her most ambitious.\r\n\r\nBy a strange fate, the book made a great sensation, especially in\r\nunimaginative circles. Idle people interpreted it to mean that there\r\nwas no harm in wasting time, vulgar people that there was no harm in\r\nbeing fickle, pious people interpreted it as an attack upon morality.\r\nThe authoress became well known in society, where her enthusiasm for\r\nthe lower classes only lent her an additional charm. That very year\r\nLady Anstey, Mrs. Heriot, the Marquis of Bamburgh, and many others,\r\npenetrated to Vorta, where the scene of the book was laid. They\r\nreturned enthusiastic. Lady Anstey exhibited her water-colour drawings;\r\nMrs. Heriot, who photographed, wrote an article in _The Strand_; while\r\n_The Nineteenth Century_ published a long description of the place\r\nby the Marquis of Bamburgh, entitled \"The Modern Peasant, and his\r\nRelations with Roman Catholicism.\"\r\n\r\nThanks to these efforts, Vorta became a rising place, and people who\r\nliked being off the beaten track went there, and pointed out the way\r\nto others. Miss Raby, by a series of trivial accidents, had never\r\nreturned to the village whose rise was so intimately connected with\r\nher own. She had heard from time to time of its progress. It had also\r\nbeen whispered that an inferior class of tourist was finding it out,\r\nand, fearing to find something spoilt, she had at last a certain\r\ndiffidence in returning to scenes which once had given her so much\r\npleasure. Colonel Leyland persuaded her; he wanted a cool healthy spot\r\nfor the summer, where he could read and talk and find walks suitable\r\nfor an athletic invalid. Their friends laughed; their acquaintances\r\ngossiped; their relatives were furious. But he was courageous and she\r\nwas indifferent. They had accomplished the expedition under the scanty\r\nægis of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nHer arrival was saddening. It displeased her to see the great hotels in\r\na great circle, standing away from the village where all life should\r\nhave centred. Their illuminated titles, branded on the tranquil evening\r\nslopes, still danced in her eyes. And the monstrous _Hôtel des Alpes_\r\nhaunted her like a nightmare. In her dreams she recalled the portico,\r\nthe ostentatious lounge, the polished walnut bureau, the vast rack for\r\nthe bedroom keys, the panoramic bedroom crockery, the uniforms of the\r\nofficials, and the smell of smart people--which is to some nostrils\r\nquite as depressing as the smell of poor ones. She was not enthusiastic\r\nover the progress of civilisation, knowing by Eastern experiences that\r\ncivilisation rarely puts her best foot foremost, and is apt to make\r\nthe barbarians immoral and vicious before her compensating qualities\r\narrive. And here there was no question of progress: the world had more\r\nto learn from the village than the village from the world.\r\n\r\nAt the _Biscione_, indeed, she had found little change--only the\r\npathos of a survival. The old landlord had died, and the old landlady\r\nwas ill in bed, but the antique spirit had not yet departed. On the\r\ntimbered front was still painted the dragon swallowing the child--the\r\narms of the Milanese Visconti, from whom the Cantùs might well be\r\ndescended. For there was something about the little hotel which\r\ncompelled a sympathetic guest to believe, for the time at all events,\r\nin aristocracy. The great manner, only to be obtained without effort,\r\nruled throughout. In each bedroom were three or four beautiful\r\nthings--a little piece of silk tapestry, a fragment of rococo carving,\r\nsome blue tiles, framed and hung upon the whitewashed wall. There were\r\npictures in the sitting-rooms and on the stairs--eighteenth-century\r\npictures in the style of Carlo Dolce and the Caracci--a blue-robed\r\nMater Dolorosa, a fluttering saint, a magnanimous Alexander with\r\na receding chin. A debased style--so the superior person and the\r\ntextbooks say. Yet, at times, it may have more freshness and\r\nsignificance than a newly-purchased Fra Angelico. Miss Raby, who had\r\nvisited dukes in their residences without a perceptible tremor, felt\r\nherself blatant and modern when she entered the _Albergo Biscione_.\r\nThe most trivial things--the sofa cushions, the table cloths, the\r\ncases for the pillows--though they might be made of poor materials and\r\nbe æsthetically incorrect, inspired her with reverence and humility.\r\nThrough this cleanly, gracious dwelling there had once moved Signor\r\nCantù with his china-bowled pipe, Signora Cantù in her snuff-coloured\r\nshawl, and Bartolommeo Cantù, now proprietor of the _Grand Hôtel des\r\nAlpes_.\r\n\r\nShe sat down to breakfast next morning in a mood which she tried to\r\nattribute to her bad night and her increasing age. Never, she thought,\r\nhad she seen people more unattractive and more unworthy than her\r\nfellow-guests. A black-browed woman was holding forth on patriotism and\r\nthe duty of English tourists to present an undivided front to foreign\r\nnations. Another woman kept up a feeble lament, like a dribbling tap\r\nwhich never gathers flow yet never quite ceases, complaining of the\r\nfood, the charges, the noise, the clouds, the dust. She liked coming\r\nhere herself, she said; but she hardly liked to recommend it to her\r\nfriends: it was the kind of hotel one felt like that about. Males were\r\nrare, and in great demand; a young one was describing, amid fits of\r\nlaughter, the steps he had taken to astonish the natives.\r\n\r\nMiss Raby was sitting opposite the famous fresco, which formed the only\r\ndecoration of the room. It had been discovered during some repairs;\r\nand, though the surface had been injured in places, the colours were\r\nstill bright. Signora Cantù attributed it now to Titian, now to Giotto,\r\nand declared that no one could interpret its meaning; professors and\r\nartists had puzzled themselves in vain. This she said because it\r\npleased her to say it; the meaning was perfectly clear, and had been\r\nfrequently explained to her. Those four figures were sibyls, holding\r\nprophecies of the Nativity. It was uncertain for what original reason\r\nthey had been painted high up in the mountains, at the extreme boundary\r\nof Italian art. Now, at all events, they were an invaluable source of\r\nconversation; and many an acquaintance had been opened, and argument\r\naverted, by their timely presence on the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't those saints cunning!\" said an American lady, following Miss\r\nRaby's glance.\r\n\r\nThe lady's father muttered something about superstition. They were\r\na lugubrious couple, lately returned from the Holy Land, where they\r\nhad been cheated shamefully, and their attitude towards religion had\r\nsuffered in consequence.\r\n\r\nMiss Raby said, rather sharply, that the saints were sibyls.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't recall sibyls,\" said the lady, \"either in the N.T. or the\r\nO.\"\r\n\r\n\"Inventions of the priests to deceive the peasantry,\" said the father\r\nsadly. \"Same as their churches; tinsel pretending to be gold, cotton\r\npretending to be silk, stucco pretending to be marble; same as their\r\nprocessions, same as their--(he swore)--campaniles.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father,\" said the lady, bending forward, \"he does suffer so from\r\ninsomnia. Fancy a bell every morning at six!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am; you profit. We've stopped it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stopped the early bell ringing?\" cried Miss Raby.\r\n\r\nPeople looked up to see who she was. Some one whispered that she wrote.\r\n\r\nHe replied that he had come up all these feet for rest, and that if he\r\ndid not get it he would move on to another centre. The English and\r\nAmerican visitors had co-operated, and forced the hotel-keepers to\r\ntake action. Now the priests rang a dinner bell, which was endurable.\r\nHe believed that \"corperation\" would do anything: it had been the same\r\nwith the peasants.\r\n\r\n\"How did the tourists interfere with the peasants?\" asked Miss Raby,\r\ngetting very hot, and trembling all over.\r\n\r\n\"We said the same; we had come for rest, and we would have it. Every\r\nweek they got drunk and sang till two. Is that a proper way to go on,\r\nanyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember,\" said Miss Raby, \"that some of them did get drunk. But I\r\nalso remember how they sang.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. Till two,\" he retorted.\r\n\r\nThey parted in mutual irritation. She left him holding forth on the\r\nnecessity of a new universal religion of the open air. Over his head\r\nstood the four sibyls, gracious for all their clumsiness and crudity,\r\neach proffering a tablet inscribed with concise promise of redemption.\r\nIf the old religions had indeed become insufficient for humanity, it\r\ndid not seem probable that an adequate substitute would be produced in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIt was too early to pay her promised visit to Signora Cantù. Nor was\r\nElizabeth, who had been rude overnight and was now tiresomely penitent,\r\na possible companion. There were a few tables outside the inn, at which\r\nsome women sat, drinking beer. Pollarded chestnuts shaded them; and a\r\nlow wooden balustrade fenced them off from the village street. On this\r\nbalustrade Miss Raby perched, for it gave her a view of the campanile.\r\nA critical eye could discover plenty of faults in its architecture. But\r\nshe looked at it all with increasing pleasure, in which was mingled a\r\ncertain gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe German waitress came out and suggested very civilly that she should\r\nfind a more comfortable seat. This was the place where the lower\r\nclasses ate; would she not go to the drawing-room?\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, no; for how many years have you classified your guests\r\naccording to their birth?\"\r\n\r\n\"For many years. It was necessary,\" replied the admirable woman. She\r\nreturned to the house full of meat and common sense, one of the many\r\nsigns that the Teuton was gaining on the Latin in this debatable valley.\r\n\r\nA grey-haired lady came out next, shading her eyes from the sun, and\r\ncrackling _The Morning Post_. She glanced at Miss Raby pleasantly, blew\r\nher nose, apologized for speaking, and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"This evening, I wonder if you know, there is a concert in aid of the\r\nstained-glass window for the English Church. Might I persuade you to\r\ntake tickets? As has been said, it is so important that English people\r\nshould have a rallying point, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most important,\" said Miss Raby; \"but I wish the rallying point could\r\nbe in England.\"\r\n\r\nThe grey-haired lady smiled. Then she looked puzzled. Then she realized\r\nthat she had been insulted, and, crackling _The Morning Post_,\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n\"I have been rude,\" thought Miss Raby dejectedly. \"Rude to a lady as\r\nsilly and as grey-haired as myself. This is not a day on which I ought\r\nto talk to people.\"\r\n\r\nHer life had been successful, and on the whole happy. She was\r\nunaccustomed to that mood, which is termed depressed, but which\r\ncertainly gives visions of wider, if greyer, horizons. That morning\r\nher outlook altered. She walked through the village, scarcely noticing\r\nthe mountains by which it was still surrounded, or the unaltered\r\nradiance of its sun. But she was fully conscious of something new; of\r\nthe indefinable corruption which is produced by the passage of a large\r\nnumber of people.\r\n\r\nEven at that time the air was heavy with meat and drink, to which were\r\nadded dust and tobacco smoke and the smell of tired horses. Carriages\r\nwere huddled against the church, and underneath the campanile a\r\nwoman was guarding a stack of bicycles. The season had been bad for\r\nclimbing; and groups of young men in smart Norfolk suits were idling\r\nup and down, waiting to be hired as guides. Two large inexpensive\r\nhotels stood opposite the post office; and in front of them innumerable\r\nlittle tables surged out into the street. Here, from an early hour in\r\nthe morning, eating had gone on, and would continue till a late hour\r\nat night. The customers, chiefly German, refreshed themselves with\r\ncries and with laughter, passing their arms round the waists of their\r\nwives. Then, rising heavily, they departed in single file towards some\r\nview-point, whereon a red flag indicated the possibility of another\r\nmeal. The whole population was employed, even down to the little girls,\r\nwho worried the guests to buy picture postcards and edelweiss. Vorta\r\nhad taken to the tourist trade.\r\n\r\nA village must have some trade; and this village had always been full\r\nof virility and power. Obscure and happy, its splendid energies had\r\nfound employment in wresting a livelihood out of the earth, whence\r\nhad come a certain dignity, and kindliness, and love for other men.\r\nCivilisation did not relax these energies, but it had diverted them;\r\nand all the precious qualities, which might have helped to heal the\r\nworld, had been destroyed. The family affection, the affection for\r\nthe commune, the sane pastoral virtues--all had perished while the\r\ncampanile which was to embody them was being built. No villain had\r\ndone this thing: it was the work of ladies and gentlemen who were good\r\nand rich and often clever--who, if they thought about the matter at\r\nall, thought that they were conferring a benefit, moral as well as\r\ncommercial, on any place in which they chose to stop.\r\n\r\nNever before had Miss Raby been conscious of such universal misdoing.\r\nShe returned to the _Biscione_ shattered and exhausted, remembering\r\nthat terrible text in which there is much semblance of justice: \"But\r\nwoe to him through whom the offence cometh.\"\r\n\r\nSignora Cantù, somewhat over-excited, was lying in a dark room on the\r\nground floor. The walls were bare; for all the beautiful things were\r\nin the rooms of her guests whom she loved as a good queen might love\r\nher subjects--and the walls were dirty also, for this was Signora\r\nCantù's own room. But no palace had so fair a ceiling; for from the\r\nwooden beams were suspended a whole dowry of copper vessels--pails,\r\ncauldrons, water pots, of every colour from lustrous black to the\r\npalest pink. It pleased the old lady to look up at these tokens of\r\nprosperity. An American lady had lately departed without them, more\r\npuzzled than angry.\r\n\r\nThe two women had little in common; for Signora Cantù was an inflexible\r\naristocrat. Had she been a great lady of the great century, she\r\nwould have gone speedily to the guillotine, and Miss Raby would have\r\nhowled approval. Now, with her scanty hair in curl-papers, and the\r\nsnuff-coloured shawl spread over her, she entertained the distinguished\r\nauthoress with accounts of other distinguished people who had\r\nstopped, and might again stop, at the _Biscione_. At first her tone\r\nwas dignified. But before long she proceeded to village news, and a\r\ncertain bitterness began to show itself. She chronicled deaths with\r\na kind of melancholy pride. Being old herself, she liked to meditate\r\non the fairness of Fate, which had not spared her contemporaries, and\r\noften had not spared her juniors. Miss Raby was unaccustomed to extract\r\nsuch consolation. She too was growing old, but it would have pleased\r\nher better if others could have remained young. She remembered few of\r\nthese people well, but deaths were symbolical, just as the death of a\r\nflower may symbolize the passing of all the spring.\r\n\r\nSignora Cantù then went on to her own misfortunes, beginning with an\r\naccount of a landslip, which had destroyed her little farm. A landslip,\r\nin that valley, never hurried. Under the green coat of turf water\r\nwould collect, just as an abscess is formed under the skin. There\r\nwould be a lump on the sloping meadow, then the lump would break and\r\ndischarge a slowly-moving stream of mud and stones. Then the whole area\r\nseemed to be corrupted; on every side the grass cracked and doubled\r\ninto fantastic creases, the trees grew awry, the barns and cottages\r\ncollapsed, all the beauty turned gradually to indistinguishable pulp,\r\nwhich slid downwards till it was washed away by some stream.\r\n\r\nFrom the farm they proceeded to other grievances, over which Miss Raby\r\nbecame almost too depressed to sympathize. It was a bad season; the\r\nguests did not understand the ways of the hotel; the servants did not\r\nunderstand the guests; she was told she ought to have a concierge. But\r\nwhat was the good of a concierge?\r\n\r\n\"I have no idea,\" said Miss Raby, feeling that no concierge would ever\r\nrestore the fortunes of the _Biscione_.\r\n\r\n\"They say he would meet the diligence and entrap the new arrivals. What\r\npleasure should I have from guests I entrapped?\"\r\n\r\n\"The other hotels do it,\" said Miss Raby, sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. Every day a man comes down from the _Alpes_.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an awkward silence. Hitherto they had avoided mentioning that\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\"He takes them all,\" she continued, in a burst of passion. \"My son\r\ntakes all my guests. He has taken all the English nobility, and the\r\nbest Americans, and all my old Milanese friends. He slanders me up and\r\ndown the valley, saying that the drains are bad. The hotel-keepers\r\nwill not recommend me; they send on their guests to him, because he\r\npays them five per cent. for every one they send. He pays the drivers,\r\nhe pays the porters, he pays the guides. He pays the band, so that it\r\nhardly ever plays down in the village. He even pays the little children\r\nto say my drains are bad. He and his wife and his concierge, they mean\r\nto ruin me, they would like to see me die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't--don't say these things, Signora Cantù.\" Miss Raby began to walk\r\nabout the room, speaking, as was her habit, what was true rather than\r\nwhat was intelligible. \"Try not to be so angry with your son. You don't\r\nknow what he had to contend with. You don't know who led him into it.\r\nSome one else may be to blame. And whoever it may be--you will remember\r\nthem in your prayers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am a Christian!\" exclaimed the angry old lady. \"But he\r\nwill not ruin me. I seem poor, but he has borrowed--too much. That\r\nhotel will fail!\"\r\n\r\n\"And perhaps,\" continued Miss Raby, \"there is not much wickedness in\r\nthe world. Most of the evil we see is the result of little faults--of\r\nstupidity or vanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I even know who led him into it--his wife, and the man who is now\r\nhis concierge.\"\r\n\r\n\"This habit of talking, of self-expression--it seems so pleasant and\r\nnecessary--yet it does harm----\"\r\n\r\nThey were both interrupted by an uproar in the street. Miss Raby opened\r\nthe window; and a cloud of dust, heavy with petrol, entered. A passing\r\nmotor car had twitched over a table. Much beer had been spilt, and a\r\nlittle blood.\r\n\r\nSignora Cantù sighed peevishly at the noise. Her ill-temper had\r\nexhausted her, and she lay motionless, with closed eyes. Over her head\r\ntwo copper vases clinked gently in the sudden gust of wind. Miss Raby\r\nhad been on the point of a great dramatic confession, of a touching\r\nappeal for forgiveness. Her words were ready; her words always were\r\nready. But she looked at those closed eyes, that suffering enfeebled\r\nframe, and she knew that she had no right to claim the luxury of pardon.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her that with this interview her life had ended. She had\r\ndone all that was possible. She had done much evil. It only remained\r\nfor her to fold her hands and to wait, till her ugliness and her\r\nincompetence went the way of beauty and strength. Before her eyes\r\nthere arose the pleasant face of Colonel Leyland, with whom she might\r\nharmlessly conclude her days. He would not be stimulating, but it did\r\nnot seem desirable that she should be stimulated. It would be better if\r\nher faculties did close, if the senseless activity of her brain and\r\nher tongue were gradually numbed. For the first time in her life, she\r\nwas tempted to become old.\r\n\r\nSignora Cantù was still speaking of her son's wife and concierge; of\r\nthe vulgarity of the former and the ingratitude of the latter, whom\r\nshe had been kind to long ago, when he first wandered up from Italy,\r\nan obscure boy. Now he had sided against her. Such was the reward of\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\n\"And what is his name?\" asked Miss Raby absently.\r\n\r\n\"Feo Ginori,\" she replied. \"You would not remember him. He used to\r\ncarry----\"\r\n\r\nFrom the new campanile there burst a flood of sound to which the copper\r\nvessels vibrated responsively. Miss Raby lifted her hands, not to her\r\nears but to her eyes. In her enfeebled state, the throbbing note of the\r\nbell had the curious effect of blood returning into frozen veins.\r\n\r\n\"I remember that man perfectly,\" she said at last; \"and I shall see him\r\nthis afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nMiss Raby and Elizabeth were seated together in the lounge of the\r\n_Hôtel des Alpes_. They had walked up from the _Biscione_ to see\r\nColonel Leyland. But he, apparently, had walked down there to see\r\nthem, and the only thing to do was to wait, and to justify the wait\r\nby ordering some refreshment. So Miss Raby had afternoon tea, while\r\nElizabeth behaved like a perfect lady over an ice, occasionally\r\nturning the spoon upside down in the mouth when she saw that no one\r\nwas looking. The under-waiters were clearing cups and glasses off the\r\nmarble-topped tables, and the gold-laced officials were rearranging\r\nthe wicker chairs into seductive groups of three and two. Here and\r\nthere the visitors lingered among their crumbs, and the Russian\r\nPrince had fallen asleep in a prominent and ungraceful position. But\r\nmost people had started for a little walk before dinner, or had\r\ngone to play tennis, or had taken a book under a tree. The weather\r\nwas delightful, and the sun had so far declined that its light had\r\nbecome spiritualized, suggesting new substance as well as new colour\r\nin everything on which it fell. From her seat Miss Raby could see\r\nthe great precipices under which they had passed the day before; and\r\nbeyond those precipices she could see Italy--the Val d'Aprile, the Val\r\nSenese and the mountains she had named \"The Beasts of the South.\" All\r\nday those mountains were insignificant--distant chips of white or grey\r\nstone. But the evening sun transfigured them, and they would sit up\r\nlike purple bears against the southern sky.\r\n\r\n\"It is a sin you should not be out, Elizabeth. Find your friend if you\r\ncan, and make her go with you. If you see Colonel Leyland, tell him I\r\nam here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all, ma'am?\" Elizabeth was fond of her eccentric mistress, and\r\nher heart had been softened by the ice. She saw that Miss Raby did not\r\nlook well. Possibly the course of love was running roughly. And indeed\r\ngentlemen must be treated with tact, especially when both parties are\r\ngetting on.\r\n\r\n\"Don't give pennies to the children: that is the only other thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe guests had disappeared, and the number of officials visibly\r\ndiminished. From the hall behind came the genteel sniggers of those two\r\nmost vile creatures, a young lady behind the bureau and a young man in\r\na frock coat who shows new arrivals to their rooms. Some of the porters\r\njoined them, standing at a suitable distance. At last only Miss Raby,\r\nthe Russian Prince, and the concierge were left in the lounge.\r\n\r\nThe concierge was a competent European of forty or so, who spoke\r\nall languages fluently, and some well. He was still active, and had\r\nevidently once been muscular. But either his life or his time of life\r\nhad been unkind to his figure: in a few years he would certainly\r\nbe fat. His face was less easy to decipher. He was engaged in the\r\nunquestioning performance of his duty, and that is not a moment for\r\nself-revelation. He opened the windows, he filled the match-boxes, he\r\nflicked the little tables with a duster, always keeping an eye on the\r\ndoor in case any one arrived without luggage, or left without paying.\r\nHe touched an electric bell, and a waiter flew up and cleared away\r\nMiss Raby's tea things. He touched another bell, and sent an underling\r\nto tidy up some fragments of paper which had fallen out of a bedroom\r\nwindow. Then \"Excuse me, madam!\" and he had picked up Miss Raby's\r\nhandkerchief with a slight bow. He seemed to bear her no grudge for her\r\nabrupt departure of the preceding evening. Perhaps it was into his hand\r\nthat she had dropped a tip. Perhaps he did not remember she had been\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe gesture with which he returned the handkerchief troubled her\r\nwith vague memories. Before she could thank him he was back in the\r\ndoorway, standing sideways, so that the slight curve of his stomach was\r\noutlined against the view. He was speaking to a youth of athletic but\r\nmelancholy appearance, who was fidgeting in the portico without. \"I\r\ntold you the percentage,\" she heard. \"If you had agreed to it, I would\r\nhave recommended you. Now it is too late. I have enough guides.\"\r\n\r\nOur generosity benefits more people than we suppose. We tip the\r\ncabman, and something goes to the man who whistled for him. We tip\r\nthe man who lights up the stalactite grotto with magnesium wire, and\r\nsomething goes to the boatman who brought us there. We tip the waiter\r\nin the restaurant, and something goes off the waiter's wages. A vast\r\nmachinery, whose existence we seldom realize, promotes the distribution\r\nof our wealth. When the concierge returned, Miss Raby asked: \"And what\r\nis the percentage?\"\r\n\r\nShe asked with the definite intention of disconcerting him, not because\r\nshe was unkind, but because she wished to discover what qualities, if\r\nany, lurked beneath that civil, efficient exterior. And the spirit of\r\nher inquiry was sentimental rather than scientific.\r\n\r\nWith an educated man she would have succeeded. In attempting to reply\r\nto her question, he would have revealed something. But the concierge\r\nhad no reason to pay even lip service to logic. He replied: \"Yes,\r\nmadam! this is perfect weather, both for our visitors and for the hay,\"\r\nand hurried to help a bishop, who was selecting a picture postcard.\r\n\r\nMiss Raby, instead of moralizing on the inferior resources of the\r\nlower classes, acknowledged a defeat. She watched the man spreading\r\nout the postcards, helpful yet not obtrusive, alert yet deferential.\r\nShe watched him make the bishop buy more than he wanted. This was the\r\nman who had talked of love to her upon the mountain. But hitherto\r\nhe had only revealed his identity by chance gestures bequeathed to\r\nhim at birth. Intercourse with the gentle classes had required new\r\nqualities--civility, omniscience, imperturbability. It was the old\r\nanswer: the gentle classes were responsible for him. It is inevitable,\r\nas well as desirable, that we should bear each other's burdens.\r\n\r\nIt was absurd to blame Feo for his worldliness--for his essential\r\nvulgarity. He had not made himself. It was even absurd to regret\r\nhis transformation from an athlete: his greasy stoutness, his big\r\nblack kiss-curl, his waxed moustache, his chin which was dividing\r\nand propagating itself like some primitive form of life. In England,\r\nnearly twenty years before, she had altered his figure as well as his\r\ncharacter. He was one of the products of \"The Eternal Moment.\"\r\n\r\nA great tenderness overcame her--the sadness of an unskilful demiurge,\r\nwho makes a world and beholds that it is bad. She desired to ask pardon\r\nof her creatures, even though they were too poorly formed to grant it.\r\nThe longing to confess, which she had suppressed that morning beside\r\nthe bed of Signora Cantù, broke out again with the violence of a\r\nphysical desire. When the bishop had gone she renewed the conversation,\r\nthough on different lines, saying: \"Yes, it is beautiful weather. I\r\nhave just been enjoying a walk up from the _Biscione_. I am stopping\r\nthere!\"\r\n\r\nHe saw that she was willing to talk, and replied pleasantly: \"The\r\n_Biscione_ must be a very nice hotel: many people speak well of it.\r\nThe fresco is very beautiful.\" He was too shrewd to object to a little\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\n\"What lots of new hotels there are!\" She lowered her voice in order not\r\nto rouse the Prince, whose presence weighed on her curiously.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, madam! I should indeed think so. When I was a lad--Excuse me one\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\nAn American girl, who was new to the country, came up with her hand\r\nfull of coins, and asked him hopelessly \"whatever they were worth.\" He\r\nexplained, and gave her change: Miss Raby was not sure that he gave her\r\nright change.\r\n\r\n\"When I was a lad----\" He was again interrupted, to speed two parting\r\nguests. One of them tipped him; he said, \"Thank you.\" The other did not\r\ntip him; he said, \"Thank you,\" all the same but not in the same way.\r\nObviously he had as yet no recollections of Miss Raby.\r\n\r\n\"When I was a lad, Vorta was a poor little place.\"\r\n\r\n\"But a pleasant place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very pleasant, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kouf!\" said the Russian Prince, suddenly waking up and startling\r\nthem both. He clapped on a felt hat, and departed at full speed for a\r\nconstitutional. Miss Raby and Feo were left together.\r\n\r\nIt was then that she ceased to hesitate, and determined to remind him\r\nthat they had met before. All day she had sought for a spark of life,\r\nand it might be summoned by pointing to that other fire which she\r\ndiscerned, far back in the travelled distance, high up in the mountains\r\nof youth. What he would do, if he also discerned it, she did not know;\r\nbut she hoped that he would become alive, that he at all events would\r\nescape the general doom which she had prepared for the place and the\r\npeople. And what she would do, during their joint contemplation, she\r\ndid not even consider.\r\n\r\nShe would hardly have ventured if the sufferings of the day had not\r\nhardened her. After much pain, respectability becomes ludicrous. And\r\nshe had only to overcome the difficulty of Feo's being a man, not the\r\ndifficulty of his being a concierge. She had never observed that\r\nspiritual reticence towards social inferiors which is usual at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n\"This is my second visit,\" she said boldly. \"I stayed at the _Biscione_\r\ntwenty years ago.\"\r\n\r\nHe showed the first sign of emotion: _that_ reference to the _Biscione_\r\nannoyed him.\r\n\r\n\"I was told I should find you up here,\" continued Miss Raby. \"I\r\nremember you very well. You used to take us over the passes.\"\r\n\r\nShe watched his face intently. She did not expect it to relax into an\r\nexpansive smile. \"Ah!\" he said, taking off his peaked cap, \"I remember\r\nyou perfectly, madam. What a pleasure, if I may say so, to meet you\r\nagain!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am pleased, too,\" said the lady, looking at him doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"You and another lady, madam, was it not? Miss----\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Harbottle.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure; I carried your luggage. I often remember your kindness.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up. He was standing near an open window, and the whole\r\nof fairyland stretched behind him. Her sanity forsook her, and she\r\nsaid gently: \"Will you misunderstand me, if I say that I have never\r\nforgotten your kindness either?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied: \"The kindness was yours, madam; I only did my duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Duty?\" she cried; \"what about duty?\"\r\n\r\n\"You and Miss Harbottle were such generous ladies. I well remember how\r\ngrateful I was: you always paid me above the tariff fare----\"\r\n\r\nThen she realized that he had forgotten everything; forgotten her,\r\nforgotten what had happened, even forgotten what he was like when he\r\nwas young.\r\n\r\n\"Stop being polite,\" she said coldly. \"You were not polite when I saw\r\nyou last.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry,\" he exclaimed, suddenly alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"Turn round. Look at the mountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes.\" His fishy eyes blinked nervously. He fiddled with his watch\r\nchain which lay in a furrow of his waistcoat. He ran away to warn some\r\npoorly dressed children off the view-terrace. When he returned she\r\nstill insisted.\r\n\r\n\"I must tell you,\" she said, in calm, business-like tones. \"Look at\r\nthat great mountain, round which the road goes south. Look half-way up,\r\non its eastern side--where the flowers are. It was there that you once\r\ngave yourself away.\"\r\n\r\nHe gaped at her in horror. He remembered. He was inexpressibly shocked.\r\n\r\nIt was at that moment that Colonel Leyland returned.\r\n\r\nShe walked up to him, saying, \"This is the man I spoke of yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon; what man?\" said Colonel Leyland fussily. He saw that\r\nshe was flushed, and concluded that some one had been rude to her.\r\nSince their relations were somewhat anomalous, he was all the more\r\nparticular that she should be treated with respect.\r\n\r\n\"The man who fell in love with me when I was young.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is untrue!\" cried the wretched Feo, seeing at once the trap that\r\nhad been laid for him. \"The lady imagined it. I swear, sir--I meant\r\nnothing. I was a lad. It was before I learnt behaviour. I had even\r\nforgotten it. She reminded me. She has disturbed me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" said Colonel Leyland. \"Good Lord!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall lose my place, sir; and I have a wife and children. I shall be\r\nruined.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sufficient!\" cried Colonel Leyland. \"Whatever Miss Raby's intentions\r\nmay be, she does not intend to ruin you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have misunderstood me, Feo,\" said Miss Raby gently.\r\n\r\n\"How unlucky we have been missing each other,\" said Colonel Leyland, in\r\ntrembling tones that were meant to be nonchalant. \"Shall we go a little\r\nwalk before dinner? I hope that you are stopping.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not attend. She was watching Feo. His alarm had subsided; and\r\nhe revealed a new emotion, even less agreeable to her. His shoulders\r\nstraightened, he developed an irresistible smile, and, when he saw that\r\nshe was looking and that Colonel Leyland was not, he winked at her.\r\n\r\nIt was a ghastly sight, perhaps the most hopelessly depressing of all\r\nthe things she had seen at Vorta. But its effect on her was memorable.\r\nIt evoked a complete vision of that same man as he had been twenty\r\nyears before. She could see him to the smallest detail of his clothes\r\nor his hair, the flowers in his hand, the graze on his wrist, the heavy\r\nbundle that he had loosed from his back, so that he might speak as a\r\nfreeman. She could hear his voice, neither insolent nor diffident,\r\nnever threatening, never apologizing, urging her first in the studied\r\nphrases he had learnt from books, then, as his passion grew, becoming\r\nincoherent, crying that she must believe him, that she must love him\r\nin return, that she must fly with him to Italy, where they would live\r\nfor ever, always happy, always young. She had cried out then, as a\r\nyoung lady should, and had thanked him not to insult her. And now, in\r\nher middle age, she cried out again, because the sudden shock and the\r\ncontrast had worked a revelation. \"Don't think I'm in love with you\r\nnow!\" she cried.\r\n\r\nFor she realized that only now was she not in love with him: that the\r\nincident upon the mountain had been one of the great moments of her\r\nlife--perhaps the greatest, certainly the most enduring: that she had\r\ndrawn unacknowledged power and inspiration from it, just as trees draw\r\nvigour from a subterranean spring. Never again could she think of it\r\nas a half-humorous episode in her development. There was more reality\r\nin it than in all the years of success and varied achievement which\r\nhad followed, and which it had rendered possible. For all her correct\r\nbehaviour and lady-like display, she had been in love with Feo, and\r\nshe had never loved so greatly again. A presumptuous boy had taken her\r\nto the gates of heaven; and, though she would not enter with him, the\r\neternal remembrance of the vision had made life seem endurable and\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nColonel Leyland, by her side, babbled respectabilities, trying to pass\r\nthe situation off as normal. He was saving her, for he liked her very\r\nmuch, and it pained him when she was foolish. But her last remark to\r\nFeo had frightened him; and he began to feel that he must save himself.\r\nThey were no longer alone. The bureau lady and the young gentleman\r\nwere listening breathlessly, and the porters were tittering at the\r\ndiscomfiture of their superior. A French lady had spread amongst the\r\nguests the agreeable news that an Englishman had surprised his wife\r\nmaking love to the concierge. On the terrace outside, a mother waved\r\naway her daughters. The bishop was preparing, very leisurely, for a\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Raby was oblivious. \"How little I know!\" she said. \"I never\r\nknew till now that I had loved him and that it was a mere chance--a\r\nlittle catch, a kink--that I never told him so.\"\r\n\r\nIt was her habit to speak out; and there was no present passion to\r\ndisturb or prevent her. She was still detached, looking back at a fire\r\nupon the mountains, marvelling at its increased radiance, but too far\r\noff to feel its heat. And by speaking out she believed, pathetically\r\nenough, that she was making herself intelligible. Her remark seemed\r\ninexpressibly coarse to Colonel Leyland.\r\n\r\n\"But these beautiful thoughts are a poor business, are they not?\" she\r\ncontinued, addressing Feo, who was losing his gallant air, and becoming\r\nbewildered. \"They're hardly enough to grow old on. I think I would give\r\nall my imagination, all my skill with words, if I could recapture one\r\ncrude fact, if I could replace one single person whom I have broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so, madam,\" he responded, with downcast eyes.\r\n\r\n\"If only I could find some one here who would understand me, to whom I\r\ncould confess, I think I should be happier. I have done so much harm in\r\nVorta, dear Feo----\"\r\n\r\nFeo raised his eyes. Colonel Leyland struck his stick on the parquetry\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\"--and at last I thought I would speak to you, in case you understood\r\nme. I remembered that you had once been very gracious to me--yes,\r\ngracious: there is no other word. But I have harmed you also: how could\r\nyou understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, I understand perfectly,\" said the concierge, who had recovered\r\na little, and was determined to end the distressing scene, in which his\r\nreputation was endangered, and his vanity aroused only to be rebuffed.\r\n\"It is you who are mistaken. You have done me no harm at all. You have\r\nbenefited me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" said Colonel Leyland. \"That is the conclusion of the whole\r\nmatter. Miss Raby has been the making of Vorta.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, sir. After the lady's book, foreigners come, hotels are\r\nbuilt, we all grow richer. When I first came here, I was a common\r\nignorant porter who carried luggage over the passes; I worked, I found\r\nopportunities, I was pleasing to the visitors--and now!\" He checked\r\nhimself suddenly. \"Of course I am still but a poor man. My wife and\r\nchildren----\"\r\n\r\n\"Children!\" cried Miss Raby, suddenly seeing a path of salvation. \"What\r\nchildren have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three dear little boys,\" he replied, without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"How old is the youngest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, five.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me have that child,\" she said impressively, \"and I will bring him\r\nup. He shall live among rich people. He shall see that they are not the\r\nvile creatures he supposes, always clamouring for respect and deference\r\nand trying to buy them with money. Rich people are good: they are\r\ncapable of sympathy and love: they are fond of the truth; and when they\r\nare with each other they are clever. Your boy shall learn this, and he\r\nshall try to teach it to you. And when he grows up, if God is good to\r\nhim he shall teach the rich: he shall teach them not to be stupid to\r\nthe poor. I have tried myself, and people buy my books and say that\r\nthey are good, and smile and lay them down. But I know this: so long as\r\nthe stupidity exists, not only our charities and missions and schools,\r\nbut the whole of our civilization, is vain.\"\r\n\r\nIt was painful for Colonel Leyland to listen to such phrases. He made\r\none more effort to rescue Miss Raby. \"Je vous prie de ne pas----\" he\r\nbegan gruffly, and then stopped, for he remembered that the concierge\r\nmust know French. But Feo was not attending, nor, of course, had\r\nhe attended to the lady's prophecies. He was wondering if he could\r\npersuade his wife to give up the little boy, and, if he did, how much\r\nthey dare ask from Miss Raby without repulsing her.\r\n\r\n\"That will be my pardon,\" she continued, \"if out of the place where\r\nI have done so much evil I bring some good. I am tired of memories,\r\nthough they have been very beautiful. Now, Feo, I want you to give me\r\nsomething else: a living boy. I shall always puzzle you; and I cannot\r\nhelp it. I have changed so much since we met, and I have changed you\r\nalso. We are both new people. Remember that; for I want to ask you one\r\nquestion before we part, and I cannot see why you shouldn't answer it.\r\nFeo! I want you to attend.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, madam,\" said the concierge, rousing himself from\r\nhis calculations. \"Is there anything I can do for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Answer 'yes' or 'no'; that day when you said you were in love with\r\nme--was it true?\"\r\n\r\nIt was doubtful whether he could have answered, whether he had now any\r\nopinion about that day at all. But he did not make the attempt. He saw\r\nagain that he was menaced by an ugly, withered, elderly woman, who was\r\ntrying to destroy his reputation and his domestic peace. He shrank\r\ntowards Colonel Leyland, and faltered: \"Madam, you must excuse me, but\r\nI had rather you did not see my wife; she is so sharp. You are most\r\nkind about my little boy; but, madam, no, she would never permit it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have insulted a lady!\" shouted the colonel, and made a chivalrous\r\nmovement of attack. From the hall behind came exclamations of horror\r\nand expectancy. Some one ran for the manager.\r\n\r\nMiss Raby interposed, saying, \"He will never think me respectable.\"\r\nShe looked at the dishevelled Feo, fat, perspiring, and unattractive,\r\nand smiled sadly at her own stupidity, not at his. It was useless to\r\nspeak to him again; her talk had scared away his competence and his\r\ncivility, and scarcely anything was left. He was hardly more human than\r\na frightened rabbit. \"Poor man,\" she murmured, \"I have only vexed him.\r\nBut I wish he would have given me the boy. And I wish he would have\r\nanswered my question, if only out of pity. He does not know the sort\r\nof thing that keeps me alive.\" She was looking at Colonel Leyland, and\r\nso discovered that he too was discomposed. It was her peculiarity that\r\nshe could only attend to the person she was speaking with, and forgot\r\nthe personality of the listeners. \"I have been vexing you as well: I am\r\nvery silly.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a little late to think about me,\" said Colonel Leyland grimly.\r\n\r\nShe remembered their conversation of yesterday, and understood him at\r\nonce. But for him she had no careful explanation, no tender pity.\r\nHere was a man who was well born and well educated, who had all those\r\nthings called advantages, who imagined himself full of insight and\r\ncultivation and knowledge of mankind. And he had proved himself to be\r\nat the exact spiritual level of the man who had no advantages, who was\r\npoor and had been made vulgar, whose early virtue had been destroyed by\r\ncircumstance, whose manliness and simplicity had perished in serving\r\nthe rich. If Colonel Leyland also believed that she was now in love\r\nwith Feo, she would not exert herself to undeceive him. Nor indeed\r\nwould she have found it possible.\r\n\r\nFrom the darkening valley there rose up the first strong singing note\r\nof the campanile, and she turned from the men towards it with a motion\r\nof love. But that day was not to close without the frustration of every\r\nhope. The sound inspired Feo to make conversation and, as the mountains\r\nreverberated, he said: \"Is it not unfortunate, sir? A gentleman went to\r\nsee our fine new tower this morning and he believes that the land is\r\nslipping from underneath, and that it will fall. Of course it will not\r\nharm us up here.\"\r\n\r\nHis speech was successful. The stormy scene came to an abrupt and\r\nplacid conclusion. Before they had realized it, she had taken up her\r\n_Baedeker_ and left them, with no tragic gesture. In that moment of\r\nfinal failure, there had been vouchsafed to her a vision of herself,\r\nand she saw that she had lived worthily. She was conscious of a triumph\r\nover experience and earthly facts, a triumph magnificent, cold, hardly\r\nhuman, whose existence no one but herself would ever surmise. From the\r\nview-terrace she looked down on the perishing and perishable beauty\r\nof the valley, and, though she loved it no less, it seemed to be\r\ninfinitely distant, like a valley in a star. At that moment, if kind\r\nvoices had called her from the hotel, she would not have returned. \"I\r\nsuppose this is old age,\" she thought. \"It's not so very dreadful.\"\r\n\r\nNo one did call her. Colonel Leyland would have liked to do so; for\r\nhe knew she must be unhappy. But she had hurt him too much; she had\r\nexposed her thoughts and desires to a man of another class. Not only\r\nshe, but he himself and all their equals, were degraded by it. She had\r\ndiscovered their nakedness to the alien.\r\n\r\nPeople came in to dress for dinner and for the concert. From the hall\r\nthere pressed out a stream of excited servants, filling the lounge as\r\nan operatic chorus fills the stage, and announcing the approach of the\r\nmanager. It was impossible to pretend that nothing had happened. The\r\nscandal would be immense, and must be diminished as it best might.\r\n\r\nMuch as Colonel Leyland disliked touching people he took Feo by the\r\narm, and then quickly raised his finger to his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, sir,\" whispered the concierge. \"Of course we\r\nunderstand----Oh, thank you, sir, thank you very much: thank you very\r\nmuch indeed!\"",
