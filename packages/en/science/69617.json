Take, for instance, the discoveries of Nobel--powerful\r\nexplosives have made it possible for men to achieve admirable things,\r\nbut they are also a terrible means of destruction in the hands of those\r\ngreat criminals who draw nations into war. I am among those who believe\r\nwith Nobel that humanity will obtain more good than evil from future\r\ndiscoveries.\"\r\n\r\n              PIERRE CURIE,\r\n\r\n                   _Nobel Conference, 1903._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATORS' NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe translators wish to acknowledge their obligations to Dr. R. B.\r\nMoore, Chief Chemist, U. S. Bureau of Mines, and an American authority\r\non radium, who kindly read the whole translation in manuscript in order\r\nto assure its accuracy as to the technical details referred to by Madame\r\nCurie in her account of the work of her husband and herself on radium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not without hesitation that I have undertaken to write the\r\nbiography of Pierre Curie. I should have preferred confiding this task\r\nto some relative or some friend of his infancy who had followed his\r\nwhole life intimately and possessed as full a knowledge of his earliest\r\nyears as of those after his marriage. Jacques Curie, Pierre's brother\r\nand the companion of his youth, was bound to him by the tenderest\r\naffection. But after his appointment to the University of Montpellier, he\r\nlived far from Pierre, and he therefore insisted that I should write the\r\nbiography, believing that no one else better knew and understood the\r\nlife of his brother. He communicated to me all his personal memories;\r\nand to this important contribution, which I have utilized in full, I\r\nhave added details related by my husband himself and a few of his\r\nfriends. Thus I have reconstituted as best I could that part of his\r\nexistence that I did not know directly. I have, in addition, tried\r\nfaithfully to express the profound impression his personality made upon\r\nme during the years of our life together.\r\n\r\nThis narrative is, to be sure, neither complete nor perfect. I hope,\r\nnevertheless, that the picture it gives of Pierre Curie is not deformed,\r\nand that it will help to conserve his memory. I wish, too, that it might\r\nremind those who knew him of the reasons for which they loved him.\r\n\r\n                             M.

WILLIAM BROWN MELONEY\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery little while a man or a woman is born to serve in some big way.\r\nSuch a one surely is Marie Curie. Her discovery of radium has advanced\r\nscience, relieved human suffering and enriched the world. The spirit in\r\nwhich she has done her work has challenged the minds and souls of men.\r\n\r\nOne morning in the spring of 1898, when the United States was going to\r\nwar with Spain, Madame Curie stepped forth from a crude shack on the\r\noutskirts of Paris, with the greatest secret of the century literally in\r\nthe palm of her hand.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the silent, unheralded great moments in the world's\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe discovery which had become a fact that morning was no accident. It\r\nwas a triumph over hardship and doubting men. It represented years of\r\npatient labor. Madame Curie and her husband, Pierre Curie, had wrested\r\nfrom Mother Earth one of her most priceless secrets.\r\n\r\nI have been asked to tell why I undertook the Marie Curie Radium\r\nCampaign and how I persuaded Madame Curie to write this book.\r\n\r\nIt is with much hesitancy that I venture to write a preface to this\r\nbook. She once chided me, in her gentle way, for an article in which I\r\nhad stated facts with some feeling--although the facts praised her. \"In\r\nscience,\" she said, \"we should be interested in things, not persons.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Curie is the most modest of women. It is only after long\r\npersuasion that she has consented to record the autobiographical notes\r\ncontained in this book. Still, so much has been left unsaid,\r\nuninterpreted, that I feel an obligation to say a word toward a fuller\r\nunderstanding of this great and noble character.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 I wrote in my editor's suggestion book: \"Greatest woman's story\r\nin the world--Marie Curie, discoverer of radium.\"\r\n\r\nFor the next four years scarcely any writer of prominence went abroad\r\nwithout a commission from me to bring back the story of Madame Curie.\r\nAlways they returned with the report: \"She was not to be found,\" or \"She\r\nwas at the front somewhere,\" or \"She won't see journalists.\" My own\r\nletters to Madame Curie brought no reply. I did not know then that great\r\nbags of mail from all parts of the world lay piled up in her laboratory\r\nwhere there was no secretary, while Madame Curie with her X-ray\r\napparatus was at the front, relieving suffering and saving lives.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1919, another mission took me to Paris and I resolved to see\r\nMadame Curie myself. My friend, Stéphane Lauzanne, Editor-in-Chief of\r\n_Le Matin_, said: \"Give it up. Become interested in something else; she\r\nwill see no one. She does nothing but work.\"\r\n\r\nI began to ask questions.\r\n\r\n\"She is very simple and exceedingly retiring,\" said Lauzanne. \"Few\r\nthings in life are more distasteful to her than publicity. Her mind is\r\nas exact and logical as science itself. She cannot accept or understand\r\nexaggerations and inaccurate quotations. She cannot understand why\r\nscientists, rather than science, should be discussed in the press. There\r\nare but two things for her--her little family and her work.\r\n\r\n\"After the death of Pierre Curie, the faculty and officials of the\r\nUniversity of Paris decided to depart from all precedent and appoint a\r\nwoman to a full professorship at the Sorbonne. Madame Curie accepted the\r\nappointment and the date was set for her installation.\r\n\r\n\"It was the history-making afternoon of October 5th, 1906. The members\r\nof the class which had formerly been instructed by Professor Pierre\r\nCurie were seated in one group.\r\n\r\n\"There was present a large crowd--celebrities, statesmen, academicians,\r\nall the faculty. Suddenly through a small side door entered a woman all\r\nin black, with pale hands and high arched forehead. The magnificent\r\nforehead won notice first. It was not merely a woman who stood before\r\nus, but a brain--a living thought. Her appearance was enthusiastically\r\napplauded for five minutes. When the applause died down, Madame Curie\r\nbent forward with slightly trembling lips. We wondered what she was\r\nabout to say. It was important. It was history, whatever she said.\r\n\r\n\"In the foreground sat a stenographer, ready to record her words. Would\r\nshe speak of her husband? Would she thank the Minister and the public?\r\nNo, she began quite simply as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'When we consider the progress made by the theories of radio-activity\r\nsince the beginning of the Nineteenth Century--' The important thing to\r\nthis great woman is work. Time should not be wasted in idle words. And\r\nso, dispensing with all superficial formality, with no betrayal of the\r\ntremendous emotion which all but overcame her--except by the extreme\r\npallor of her face and the trembling of her lips--she continued her\r\nlecture in clear, well-modulated tones.\r\n\r\n\"It was typical of this great soul that she should carry on their work\r\ncourageously and without faltering.\r\n\r\n\"You will see,\" concluded Lauzanne, \"it is useless to try to interrupt\r\nher work for interviews.\"\r\n\r\nLater I met one of Madame Curie's fellow scientists who sympathized with\r\nmy desire, but who agreed with Lauzanne that an interview was\r\nimpossible. Finally, however, he promised to carry a letter to Madame\r\nCurie.\r\n\r\nI wrote ten letters and destroyed them. In one I said: \"My father, who\r\nwas a medical man, wrote: 'It is impossible to exaggerate the\r\nunimportance of people.' But you have been important to me for twenty\r\nyears, and I want to see you a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer came within an hour. I was to go to the laboratory the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nI had been in Mr. Edison's laboratory a few weeks before sailing from\r\nhome. Edison is rich in the material things--as he should be. Every kind\r\nof equipment is at his command. He is a power in the financial as well\r\nas the scientific world. In my childhood I had lived near Alexander\r\nGraham Bell; had admired his great house and his fine horses. A short\r\ntime before, I had been in Pittsburgh, where the sky is plumed by the\r\ntall smoke stacks of the greatest radium reduction plants in the world.\r\n\r\nI remembered that millions of dollars had been spent on radium watches\r\nand radium gun sights. Several millions of dollars' worth of radium was\r\neven then stored in various parts of the United States. I had been\r\nprepared to meet a woman of the world, enriched by her own efforts and\r\nestablished in one of the white palaces of the Champs d'Elysées or some\r\nother beautiful boulevard of Paris.\r\n\r\nI found a simple woman, working in an inadequate laboratory and living\r\nin a simple apartment on the meager pay of a French professor.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the new building at Number One Rue Pierre Curie, which\r\nstands out conspicuously among the old walls of the University of Paris,\r\nI had already formed a picture of the laboratory of the discoverer of\r\nradium.\r\n\r\nI waited a few minutes in the bare little office which might have been\r\nfurnished from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Then the door opened and I saw a\r\npale, timid little woman in a black cotton dress, with the saddest face\r\nI had ever looked upon.\r\n\r\nHer well-formed hands were rough. I noticed a characteristic, nervous\r\nlittle habit of rubbing the tips of her fingers over the pad of her\r\nthumb in quick succession. I learned later that working with radium had\r\nmade them numb. Her kind, patient, beautiful face had the detached\r\nexpression of a scholar. Suddenly I felt like an intruder.\r\n\r\nI was struck dumb. My timidity exceeded her own. I had been a trained\r\ninterrogator for twenty years, but I could not ask a single question of\r\nthis gentle woman in a black cotton dress. I tried to explain that\r\nAmerican women were interested in her great work, and found myself\r\napologizing for intruding upon her precious time. To put me at my ease,\r\nMadame Curie began to talk about America. She had for many years wanted\r\nto visit my country, but she could not be separated from her children.\r\n\r\n\"America,\" she said, \"has about fifty grammes of radium. Four of these\r\nare in Baltimore, six in Denver, seven in New York.\" She went on naming\r\nthe location of every grain.\r\n\r\n\"And in France?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"My laboratory,\" she replied simply, \"has hardly more than a gramme.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_ have only a gramme?\" I exclaimed. That meant less than\r\none-twenty-ninth of an ounce.\r\n\r\n\"I? Oh, I have none,\" she corrected. \"It belongs to my laboratory.\"\r\n\r\nI suggested royalties on her patents. Surely she had protected her right\r\nto the processes by which radium is produced. The revenue from such\r\npatents should have made her a very rich woman.\r\n\r\nQuietly, and without any seeming consciousness of the tremendous\r\nrenunciation, she said, \"There were no patents. We were working in the\r\ninterests of science. Radium was not to enrich any one. Radium is an\r\nelement. It belongs to all people.\"\r\n\r\nShe had contributed to the progress of science and the relief of human\r\nsuffering, and yet, in the prime of her life she was without the tools\r\nwhich would enable her to make further contribution of her genius.\r\n\r\n\"If you had the whole world to choose from,\" I asked impulsively, \"what\r\nwould you take?\" It was a silly question, perhaps, but as it happened,\r\na fateful one.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to have everything in the world you need to go on with your\r\nwork,\" I said. \"Some one must undertake this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who will?\" she asked rather hopelessly.\r\n\r\n\"The women of America,\" I promised--and then I rose to go.\r\n\r\nThat week I learned that the market price of a gramme of radium was one\r\nhundred thousand dollars. I also learned that Madame Curie's laboratory,\r\nalthough practically a new building, was without sufficient equipment;\r\nthat the radium held there was used at that time only for extracting\r\nemanations for hospital use in cancer treatment.\r\n\r\nI saw Madame Curie at the Institute again and then in her own home--a\r\nsmall apartment in the Ile St. Louis, where she lived with her two\r\ndaughters. It was a happy, busy little family. They had no protest\r\nagainst life except to regret that lack of equipment interfered with the\r\nimportant research work Madame Curie and her daughter, Irene, should\r\nhave been doing.\r\n\r\nIt was my hope when I arrived in New York, a few weeks afterwards, to\r\nfind ten women to subscribe ten thousand dollars each for the purchase\r\nof a gramme of radium, and in this way to enable Madame Curie to go on\r\nwith her work, without the publicity of a general campaign. That hope\r\nwas soon dashed. I found one or two such women, but not ten.\r\n\r\nThere were not ten to buy that gramme of radium but there were a hundred\r\nthousand women and a group of men to help, who determined the money must\r\nbe raised.\r\n\r\nMy first direct and substantial support came from Mrs. William Vaughn\r\nMoody, widow of the American poet and playwright.\r\n\r\nWhen we found it would be necessary to launch a national campaign, Mrs.\r\nRobert G. Mead, a doctor's daughter, and one who had been a standby in\r\ncancer prevention work, became secretary, and Mrs. Nicholas F. Brady an\r\nexecutive member of the committee. Behind these women stood a group of\r\nscientific men, who knew what radium had meant to humanity, among them\r\nDr. Robert Abbe, the first American surgeon to use radium, and Dr.\r\nFrancis Carter Wood.\r\n\r\nIn less than a year the fund had been raised.\r\n\r\nStéphane Lauzanne describes a second impressive moment in the life of\r\nMadame Curie. It was nearly a year after my talk with her. It was\r\nfifteen years since that scene at the University of Paris. These years\r\nhad been spent in her laboratory; she had made no public appearance. It\r\nwas in March, 1921, that Monsieur Lauzanne heard her voice again.\r\n\r\n\"I lifted the telephone receiver,\" he relates, \"and heard these words:\r\n'Madame Curie wishes to speak to you.' What extraordinary event--what\r\ntragedy, perhaps, might this not mean? And suddenly, over the wire came\r\nthe sound of the voice which I had heard only once before, but which had\r\nstayed in my memory--the same voice which had once pronounced the words,\r\n'When we consider the progress made by the theories of radio-activity\r\nsince the beginning of the Nineteenth Century----'\r\n\r\n\"'I wanted to tell you that I am going to America,' she said. 'It was\r\nvery hard for me to decide to go, because America is so far and so big.\r\nIf some one did not come for me, I should probably never have made the\r\ntrip. I should have been too frightened. But to this fear is added a\r\ngreat joy. I have devoted my life to the science of radio-activity and I\r\nknow all we owe to America in the field of science. I am told you are\r\namong those who strongly favor this distant trip, so I wanted to tell\r\nyou I have decided to go, but please don't let any one know about it.'\r\n\r\n\"This great woman--the greatest woman in France--was speaking haltingly,\r\ntremblingly, almost like a little girl. She, who handles daily a\r\nparticle of radium more dangerous than lightning, was afraid when\r\nconfronted by the necessity of appearing before the public.\"\r\n\r\nA little later, when Madame Curie and I had embarked for America, where\r\nshe was to receive her radium and other experimental material, I asked\r\nher if, the day I had first given her the promise, she had believed that\r\nAmerican women would rally to her aid.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she confessed honestly, \"but I knew you were sincere.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the time of her marriage, one of her relatives gave Madame Curie a\r\ngift of money to be used for a trousseau. It was not a great sum, but\r\nimportant to the poor student in Paris. To understand the significance\r\nof the use to which she put this fund, it is necessary to remember that\r\nMarie Sklodowska was young, and possessed physical beauty and charm. She\r\nwas not without appreciation of the beautiful, and she could not\r\npossibly have been utterly unconscious of her own appearance. She had a\r\nyoung girl's natural interest in pretty clothes. She considered the\r\npurchase of a wedding gown and other personal belongings, and then, with\r\nher characteristic exactness, measured her needs and the future.\r\n\r\nShe was married in a simple dress she had brought from Poland, and her\r\ntrousseau fund was spent on two bicycles, so that she and Pierre Curie\r\nmight enjoy the beautiful country of France. That was their honeymoon.\r\n\r\nOne dream that Madame Curie held, and still holds unrealized, is the\r\nhope of a quiet little home of her own with a garden and hedge, and\r\nflowers and birds. During her American travels, she would frequently\r\nglance through the window as the train passed through a small town, and,\r\nspying some modest little house with a garden, would say, \"I have always\r\nwanted such a little home.\"\r\n\r\nBut owning a house was secondary in the life of both Pierre and Marie\r\nCurie. They simply made a home wherever they lived, for such money as\r\nmight have gone for the purchase of her little dream house was always\r\nneeded in the laboratory. She told me one day, with deep feeling, that\r\none of the regrets of her life was that Pierre Curie had died without\r\never having had a permanent laboratory.\r\n\r\nShe had, as I have said, refused opportunities to come to the United\r\nStates because she could not endure separation from her children. She\r\nwas, I think, finally persuaded to face the long trip and the terrifying\r\npublicity attending it, partly because of her gratitude for the support\r\ngiven her scientific work, but principally because it offered a splendid\r\nopportunity for travel to her daughters.\r\n\r\nThere is in Madame Curie none of the legendary coldness and\r\nthoughtlessness attributed to the scientist. During the war, when she\r\nran her own radiological truck and lived on the march from hospital to\r\nhospital in the zone of operations, she washed and dried and pressed her\r\nown clothes. Once during our American travels, we stayed in a home where\r\nthere were several other house guests besides our party of five. I\r\nentered Madame Curie's room and found her washing her underclothes.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing at all,\" she said, when I protested. \"I know perfectly\r\nwell how to do it, and with all of these extra guests in the house, the\r\nservants have enough to do.\"\r\n\r\nOn the night before the reception at the White House, at which President\r\nHarding was to present the gramme of radium to Madame Curie, the Deed\r\nwas brought to Madame Curie. It was a beautifully engraved scroll,\r\nprepared in the office of Coudert Brothers, vesting all rights to a\r\ngramme of radium, the gift of American women, in Madame Curie.\r\n\r\nShe read the paper carefully, and then, after a few moments of thought,\r\nsaid: \"It is very fine and generous, but it must not be left this way.\r\nThis gramme of radium represents a great deal of money, but more than\r\nthat, it represents the women of this country. It is not for me; it is\r\nfor science. I am not well; I may die any day. My daughter Eve is not of\r\nlegal age, and if I should die it would mean that this radium would go\r\nto my estate and would be divided between my daughters. It is not for\r\nthat purpose. This radium must be consecrated for all time to the use of\r\nscience. Will you have your lawyer draw a paper which will make this\r\nvery clear?\"\r\n\r\nI said that it would be done in a few days.\r\n\r\n\"It must be done to-night,\" she said. \"To-morrow I receive the radium,\r\nand I might die tomorrow. Too much is at stake.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, late as it was on that hot May evening, after some difficulty,\r\nwe secured the services of a lawyer, who prepared the paper from a draft\r\nMadame Curie herself had written. She signed it before starting for\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThis document read:\r\n\r\n\"In the event of my death I give to the Institut du Radium, of Paris,\r\nfor exclusive use in the Laboratoire Curie, the gramme of radium which\r\nwas given to me by the Executive Committee of Women of the Marie Curie\r\nRadium Fund, pursuant to an agreement dated the 19th day of May, 1921.\"\r\n\r\nThis act was consistent with the whole life of the discoverer of radium;\r\nwith the answer she had made to my question a year before:\r\n\r\n\"Radium is not to enrich any one. It is an element; it is for all\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nDuring her American travels, I repeatedly requested Madame Curie to\r\nwrite the story of her life. I urged its importance to history and its\r\ninfluence among students preparing to consecrate their lives to science.\r\n\r\nFinally she consented. \"But it will not be much of a book,\" she said.\r\n\"It is such an uneventful, simple little story. I was born in Warsaw of\r\na family of teachers. I married Pierre Curie and had two children. I\r\nhave done my work in France.\"\r\n\r\nA simple statement, but fraught with what meaning! When most of us shall\r\nhave been forgotten, when even the Great World War shall have dwindled\r\nto a few pages in the history books, when Governments shall have fallen\r\nand risen and fallen again, the work of Marie Curie will be remembered.\r\n\r\nOf her work and her husband's, volumes--veritable libraries--have been\r\nwritten since that spring morning in 1898, when after an all night vigil\r\nin a shack on the outskirts of Paris, she came forth with the great gift\r\nof radium to mankind. Scientists will go on adding to the bibliography\r\nof the marvelous element. But of Marie Curie herself, the woman, it is\r\nunlikely that the world will ever read more than the brief notes which\r\ncompose this small book.\r\n\r\nIt is her conviction, her philosophy, that \"In science we should be\r\ninterested in things, not persons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE CURIE FAMILY. INFANCY AND FIRST\r\nSTUDIES OF PIERRE CURIE\r\n\r\n\r\nPierre Curie's parents, who were educated and intelligent, formed a part\r\nof the _petite bourgeoisie_ of small means. They did not frequent\r\nfashionable society, but confined themselves entirely to the\r\ncompanionship of their relatives and a few intimate friends.\r\n\r\nEugène Curie, Pierre's father, was a physician and the son of a\r\nphysician. He knew very few kinsmen of his name, and very little about\r\nthe Curie family, which was of Alsatian (Eugène Curie was born at\r\nMulhouse in 1827) and Protestant origin. Even though his father was\r\nestablished in London, Eugène had been brought up in Paris, where he\r\npursued his studies in the natural sciences and medicine, and worked as\r\npreparator under Gratiollet in the laboratories of the Museum.\r\n\r\nDoctor Eugène Curie's remarkable personality impressed all who\r\napproached him. He was a tall man, who in youth must have been blonde,\r\nwith beautiful blue eyes of a clearness and brilliancy that were\r\nstriking even in an advanced old age. These eyes, which had retained a\r\nchild-like expression, reflected goodness and intelligence. He had\r\nindeed unusual intellectual capacities, a very live aptitude for the\r\nnatural sciences, and the temperament of a scholar.\r\n\r\nAlthough he wished to consecrate his life to scientific work, family\r\nresponsibilities following his marriage and the birth of two sons forced\r\nhim to renounce this desire. The necessities of life obliged him to\r\npractice his medical profession. He continued, however, such\r\nexperimental research as his means permitted, in particular undertaking\r\nan investigation upon inoculation for tuberculosis at a time when the\r\nbacterial nature of this malady was not yet established. His scientific\r\navocations developed in him the habit of making excursions in search of\r\nthe plants and animals necessary to his experiments, and this habit, as\r\nwell as his love of Nature, gave him a marked preference for country\r\nlife. Until the end of his life he conserved his love for science, and,\r\nwithout doubt, also, his regret at not having been able to devote\r\nhimself exclusively to it.\r\n\r\nHis medical career remained always a modest one, but it revealed\r\nremarkable qualities of devotion and disinterestedness. At the time of\r\nthe Revolution of 1848, when he was still a student, the Government of\r\nthe Republic conferred on him a medal, \"for his honorable and courageous\r\nconduct\" in serving the wounded. He himself had been struck, on February\r\n24th, by a ball which shattered a part of his jaw. A little later,\r\nduring a cholera epidemic, he installed himself, in order that he might\r\nlook after the sick, in a quarter of Paris deserted by physicians.\r\nDuring the Commune he established a hospital in his apartment (rue de la\r\nVisitation) near which there was a barricade, and there he cared for the\r\nwounded. Through this act of civism and because of his advanced\r\nconvictions he lost a part of his _bourgeois_ patronage. At this time he\r\naccepted the position of medical inspector of the organization for the\r\nprotection of young children. The duties of this post permitted him to\r\nlive in the suburbs of Paris where health conditions for himself and his\r\nfamily were much better than those of the city.\r\n\r\nDoctor Curie had very pronounced political convictions. Temperamentally\r\nan idealist, he had embraced with ardor that republican doctrine which\r\ninspired the revolutionaries of 1848. He was united in friendship with\r\nHenri Brisson and the men of his group. Like them, a free thinker and an\r\nanticlerical, he did not have his sons baptized, nor did he have them\r\npractice any form of religion.\r\n\r\nPierre's mother, Claire Depouilly, was the daughter of a prominent\r\nmanufacturer of Puteaux, near Paris. Her father and brothers\r\ndistinguished themselves through their numerous inventions connected\r\nwith the making of dyes and special tissues. The family, which was of\r\nSavoy, was caught in the business catastrophe caused by the Revolution\r\nof 1848, and ruined. And these reverses of fortune, added to those which\r\nDoctor Curie had experienced during his career, meant that he and his\r\nfamily lived always in comparatively straightened circumstances, with\r\nthe difficulties of existence often renewed. Even though raised for a\r\nlife of ease, Pierre's mother accepted with tranquil courage the\r\nprecarious conditions which life brought her, and gave proof of an\r\nextreme devotion as she made life easier for her husband and children by\r\nher activity and her good will.\r\n\r\nIf the circumstances in which Jacques and Pierre grew up were modest and\r\nnot free from cares, nevertheless there reigned in the family an\r\natmosphere of gentleness and affection. In speaking to me for the first\r\ntime of his parents, Pierre Curie said that they were \"exquisite.\"\r\nThey were, in truth, that. The father's spirit was a little\r\nauthoritative--always awake and active. And he possessed a rare\r\nunselfishness. He neither wished nor knew how to profit by personal\r\nrelations to ameliorate his condition. He loved his wife and sons\r\ntenderly, and was ever ready to aid all who needed him. The mother was\r\nslight, vivid in character, and, even though her health had suffered\r\nthrough the birth of her sons, was always gay and active in the simple\r\nhome that she so well knew how to make attractive and hospitable.\r\n\r\nWhen I first knew them they lived at Sceaux, rue des Sablons (to-day rue\r\nPierre Curie) in a little house of ancient construction half concealed\r\namidst the verdure of a pretty garden. Their life was peaceful. Doctor\r\nCurie went where his duties called him, either in Sceaux or in\r\nneighboring localities. Beyond this he occupied himself with his garden\r\nor his reading. Near relatives and neighbors came to visit on Sundays,\r\nwhen bowling and chess were the favorite amusements. From time to time\r\nHenri Brisson sought out his old companion in his tranquil retreat.\r\nGreat calm and serenity enveloped the garden, the dwelling, and its\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nPierre Curie was born the 15th of May, 1859, in a house facing the\r\nJardin des Plantes, rue Cuvier, where his parents lived at the time when\r\nhis father was working in the Museum laboratories. He was the second son\r\nof Doctor Curie and three and a half years younger than his brother\r\nJacques. In after life he retained few particularly characteristic\r\nmemories of his childhood in Paris; yet he did tell me how vividly\r\npresent in his mind were the days of the Commune, the battle on the\r\nbarricade so near the house where he then lived, the hospital\r\nestablished by his father, and the expeditions, on which his brother\r\naccompanied him, in search of the wounded.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1883 that Pierre moved with his parents from the capital to\r\nthe suburbs of Paris, living first, from 1883 to 1892, at\r\nFontenay-aux-Roses, then at Sceaux from 1892 to 1895, the year of our\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nPierre passed his childhood entirely within the family circle; he never\r\nwent to the elementary school nor to the lycée. His earliest\r\ninstruction was given him first by his mother and was then continued by\r\nhis father and his elder brother, who himself had never followed in any\r\ncomplete way the course of the lycée. Pierre's intellectual capacities\r\nwere not those which would permit the rapid assimilation of a prescribed\r\ncourse of studies. His dreamer's spirit would not submit itself to the\r\nordering of the intellectual effort imposed by the school. The\r\ndifficulty he experienced in following such a program was usually\r\nattributed to a certain slowness of mind. He himself believed that he\r\nhad this slow mind and often said so. I think, however, that this belief\r\nwas not entirely justified. It seems to me, rather, that already from\r\nhis early youth it was necessary for him to concentrate his thought with\r\ngreat intensity upon a certain definite object, in order to obtain a\r\nprecise result, and that it was impossible for him to interrupt or to\r\nmodify the course of his reflections to suit exterior circumstances. It\r\nis clear that a mind of this kind can hold within itself great future\r\npossibilities. But it is no less clear that no system of education has\r\nbeen especially provided by the public school for persons of this\r\nintellectual category, which nevertheless includes more representatives\r\nthan one would believe at first sight.\r\n\r\nVery fortunately for Pierre, who could not, as we can see, become a\r\nbrilliant pupil in a lycée, his parents had a sufficiently keen\r\nintelligence to understand his difficulty, and they refrained from\r\ndemanding of their son an effort which would have been prejudicial to\r\nhis development. If, then, Pierre's earliest instruction was irregular\r\nand incomplete, it had the advantage of not so weighing on his\r\nintelligence as to deform it by dogmas, prejudices or preconceived\r\nideas. And he was always grateful to his parents for this very liberal\r\nattitude. He grew up in all freedom, developing his taste for natural\r\nscience through his excursions into the country, where he collected\r\nplants and animals for his father. These excursions, which he made\r\neither alone or with one of the family, helped to awake in him a great\r\nlove of Nature, a passion which endured to the end of his life.\r\n\r\nIntimate contact with Nature, which, because of the artificial\r\nconditions of city life and of traditional education, few children can\r\nknow, had a decisive influence on Pierre's development. Guided by his\r\nfather, he learned to observe facts and to interpret them correctly. He\r\nbecame familiar with the animals and plants of the environs of Paris. He\r\nknew which ones could be found at each season of the year in the forests\r\nand fields, the streams and ponds. The ponds in particular had for him\r\nan ever new attraction with their characteristic vegetation and their\r\npopulation of frogs, tritons, salamanders, dragonflies, and other\r\ndenizens of air and water. No efforts to obtain the objects of his\r\ninterests seemed too great for him. He never hesitated to take any\r\nanimal in his hands in order to examine it more closely. Later, after\r\nour marriage, in our walks together, if I made some objection to letting\r\nhim put a frog into my hands, he would exclaim: \"But no, see how pretty\r\nit is!\" He loved always, too, to bring back bouquets of wild flowers\r\nfrom his walks.\r\n\r\nThus his knowledge of natural history progressed rapidly. At the same\r\ntime, also, he was mastering the elements of mathematics. His classical\r\nstudies, on the contrary, had been much neglected, and it was\r\nprincipally through general reading that he acquired a knowledge of\r\nliterature and history. His father, who was widely cultured, possessed a\r\nlibrary containing many French and foreign works. Having himself a very\r\npronounced taste for reading, he was able to communicate it to his son.\r\n\r\nWhen he was about fourteen years old, a very happy event occurred in\r\nPierre's education. He was put under an excellent professor, A. Bazille,\r\nwho taught him elementary and advanced mathematics. This master was able\r\nto appreciate his young pupil, became much attached to him, and directed\r\nhis work with the greatest solicitude. He even helped him to advance in\r\nhis study of Latin, in which he was very much behind. At the same time\r\nPierre and Albert Bazille, his professor's son, became friends.\r\n\r\nThis teaching had, I am sure, a great influence on the mind of Pierre,\r\naiding him to develop and to sound the depth of his faculties and to\r\nrealize his capacities for science. He had a remarkable aptitude for\r\nmathematics, which expressed itself chiefly by a characteristic\r\ngeometric spirit and a great power of spatial vision. He, therefore,\r\nprogressed rapidly and joyfully in his studies under M. Bazille, for\r\nwhom he always felt an unalterable gratitude.\r\n\r\nHe once told me something which proved that even at this time he was not\r\ncontent solely to follow a fixed program of studies, but that he had\r\nalready begun to launch out into personal investigation. Strongly\r\nattracted by the theory of determinants, which he had just mastered, he\r\nundertook to realize an analogous conception, but in three dimensions,\r\nand endeavored to discover the properties and uses of these \"cubical\r\ndeterminants.\" Needless to say that at his age, and with the knowledge\r\nthen at his disposal, such an enterprise was beyond his powers. The\r\nattempt, however, was none the less indicative of his awakening\r\ninventive spirit.\r\n\r\nSeveral years later, when preoccupied with reflections upon symmetry, he\r\nasked himself the question: \"Could not one find a general method for the\r\nsolution of any equation whatever? Everything is a question of\r\nsymmetry.\" He did not then know of Galois' theory of groups which had\r\nmade it possible to attack this problem. But he was happy later to learn\r\nits results in the geometric applications to the case of equations of\r\nthe 5th degree.\r\n\r\nThanks to his rapid progress in mathematics and physics, Pierre Curie\r\nwas made a bachelor of science at the age of sixteen years. With this he\r\npassed his most difficult stage of formal education. The only thing with\r\nwhich he had to concern himself in the future was the acquisition of\r\nknowledge through his personal and independent effort in a field of\r\nscience freely chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nDREAMS OF YOUTH. FIRST SCIENTIFIC WORK.\r\nDISCOVERY OF PIEZO-ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\n\r\nPierre Curie was still very young when he began his higher studies in\r\npreparation for the licentiate in physics. He followed the lectures and\r\nlaboratory work at the Sorbonne and had, besides, access to the\r\nlaboratory of Professor Leroux in the School of Pharmacy, where he\r\nassisted in the preparation of the physics courses. At the same time he\r\nbecame further acquainted with laboratory methods by working with his\r\nbrother Jacques, who was then preparator of chemistry courses under\r\nRiche and Jungfleisch.\r\n\r\nPierre received his licentiate in physical sciences at the age of\r\neighteen. During his studies he had attracted the attention of Desains,\r\ndirector of the University laboratory, and of Mouton, assistant director\r\nof the same laboratory. Thanks to their appreciation he was appointed,\r\nwhen only nineteen years old, preparator for Desains and placed in\r\ncharge of the students' laboratory work in physics. He held this\r\nposition five years, and it was during this time that he began his\r\nexperimental research.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that because of his financial situation Pierre was\r\nobliged, at this early age of nineteen, to accept the post of preparator\r\ninstead of being able to give his whole time for two or three years\r\nlonger to his University studies. With his time thus absorbed by his\r\nprofessional duties and his investigations he had to give up following\r\nthe lectures in higher mathematics, and he therefore passed no further\r\nexaminations. In compensation, however, he was released from military\r\nservice in conformity with the privileges at that time accorded young\r\nmen who undertook to serve as teachers in the public-school system.\r\n\r\nHe was by this time a tall and slender young man with chestnut-colored\r\nhair and a shy and reserved expression. At the same time his youthful\r\nface mirrored a profound inner life. One has such an impression of him\r\nas he appears in a good group photograph of Doctor Curie's family. His\r\nhead is resting on his hand in a pose of abstraction and reverie, and\r\none cannot but be struck by the expression of the large, limpid eyes\r\nthat seem to be following some inner vision. Beside him the brown-haired\r\nbrother offers a striking contrast, his vivacious eyes and whole\r\nappearance suggesting decision.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers loved each other tenderly and lived as good comrades,\r\nbeing accustomed to work together in the laboratory and walk together in\r\ntheir free hours. They also kept up affectionate relations with a few of\r\ntheir childhood friends: Louis Depouilly, their cousin, who became a\r\nphysician; Louis Vauthier, also later a physician; and Albert Bazille,\r\nwho became an engineer in the post and telegraph service.\r\n\r\nPierre used to tell me of the vivid memories he had of the vacations\r\npassed at Draveil on the Seine, where, with his brother Jacques, he took\r\nlong walks beside the river, agreeably interrupted by swimming and\r\ndiving in the stream. Both brothers were excellent swimmers. Sometimes\r\nthey tramped for entire days. They had, at an early age, acquired the\r\nhabit of visiting the suburbs of Paris on foot. At times also Pierre\r\nmade solitary excursions which well suited his meditative spirit. On\r\nthese occasions he lost all sense of time, and went to the extreme limit\r\nof his physical forces. Absorbed in delightful contemplation of the\r\nthings about him, he was not conscious of material difficulties.\r\n\r\nOn the pages of a diary written in 1879,[1] he thus expressed the\r\nsalutary influence of the country upon him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a good time I have passed there in that gracious solitude, so\r\nfar from the thousand little worrying things that torment me in Paris.\r\nNo, I do not regret my nights passed in the woods, and my solitary days.\r\nIf I had the time I would let myself recount all my musings. I would\r\nalso describe my delicious valley, filled with the perfume of aromatic\r\nplants, the beautiful mass of foliage, so fresh and so humid, that hung\r\nover the Bièvre, the fairy palace with its colonnades of hops, the\r\nstony hills, red with heather, where it was so good to be. Oh, I shall\r\nremember always with gratitude the forest of the Minière; of all the\r\nwoods I have seen, it is this one that I have loved most and where I\r\nhave been happiest. Often in the evening I would start out and ascend\r\nagain this valley, and I would return with twenty ideas in my head.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, for Pierre Curie, the sensation of well-being he experienced in\r\nthe country was derived from the opportunity for tranquil reflection.\r\nDaily life in Paris with its numerous interruptions did not permit of\r\nundisturbed concentration, and this was to him a cause of inquietude and\r\nsuffering. He felt himself destined for scientific research; for him the\r\nnecessity was imperative of comprehending the phenomena of Nature in\r\norder to form a satisfactory theory to explain them. But when trying to\r\nfix his mind on some problem he had frequently to turn aside because of\r\nthe multiplicity of futile things that disturbed his reflections and\r\nplunged him into discouragement.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading, \"A day like too many others,\" he enumerated in his\r\ndiary a list of the puerile happenings that had completely filled one of\r\nhis days, leaving no time for useful work. He then concluded: \"There is\r\nmy day, and I have accomplished nothing. Why?\" Further on he returns to\r\nthe same theme under a title borrowed from Victor Hugo's \"Le Roi\r\nS'Amuse,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To deafen with little bells the spirit that would think.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In order that, weak one that I am, I shall not let my head turn with\r\nall the winds, yielding to the least breath that touches it, it is\r\nnecessary that all should be immobile about me, or that, like a spinning\r\ntop, movement alone should render me insensible to external objects.\r\n\r\n\"When, in the process of turning slowly upon myself, I try to gain\r\nmomentum, a nothing, a word, a story, a paper, a visit stops me and is\r\nable to put off or retard forever the moment when, granted a sufficient\r\nswiftness I might have, in spite of my surroundings, concentrated on my\r\nown intention.... We must eat, drink, sleep, be idle, love, touch the\r\nsweetest things of life and yet not succumb to them. It is necessary\r\nthat, in doing all this, the higher thoughts to which one is dedicated\r\nremain dominant and continue their unmoved course in our poor heads. It\r\nis necessary to make a dream of life, and to make of a dream a reality.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis acute analysis, sufficiently surprising in a young man of twenty\r\nyears, suggests in an admirable manner the conditions necessary to the\r\nhighest manifestations of the intellect. It carries a lesson which, if\r\nit were sufficiently understood, would facilitate the way of all\r\ncontemplative spirits capable of opening new paths for humanity.\r\n\r\nThe unity of thought toward which Pierre Curie strove was troubled not\r\nonly by professional and social obligations but also by his tastes,\r\nwhich urged him towards a broad literary and artistic culture. Like his\r\nfather, he loved reading, and did not fear to undertake arduous literary\r\ntasks. To some criticism made in this connection, he responded readily:\r\n\"I do not dislike tedious books.\" This meant that he was fascinated by\r\nthe search after truth which is sometimes associated with writing devoid\r\nof charm. He also loved painting and music, and went gladly to look at\r\npictures or to attend a concert. A few fragments of poetry in his\r\nhandwriting were left among his papers.\r\n\r\nBut all these preoccupations were subordinated in his mind to what he\r\nconsidered his true task, and when his scientific imagination was not in\r\nfull activity, he felt himself, in a sense, an incomplete being. He\r\nexpressed this inquietude with an emotion born of his suffering during\r\nmomentary periods of depression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What shall I become?\" he wrote. \"Very rarely have I command of all\r\nmyself; ordinarily a part of me sleeps. My poor spirit, are you then so\r\nweak that you cannot control my body? Oh, my thoughts, you count indeed\r\nfor very little! I should have the greatest confidence in the power of\r\nmy imagination to pull me out of the rut, but I greatly fear that my\r\nimagination is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut despite hesitations, doubts, and lost moments, the young man was\r\nlittle by little striking out his path and strengthening his will. He\r\nwas resolutely carrying on fruitful investigations at an age when many\r\nmen who were to become savants were as yet only pupils.\r\n\r\nHis first work, done in collaboration with Desains, concerned the\r\ndetermination of the lengths of heat waves with the aid of a\r\nthermoelectric element and a metallic wire grating, a process, then\r\nentirely new, which has since often been employed in the study of this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nFollowing this he undertook an investigation on crystals in\r\ncollaboration with his brother, who had passed his licentiate and was\r\npreparator for Friedel in the laboratory of mineralogy at the Sorbonne.\r\nTheir experiments led the two young physicists to a great success: the\r\ndiscovery of the hitherto unknown phenomena of piezo-electricity, which\r\nconsists of an electric polarization produced by the compression or the\r\nexpansion of crystals in the direction of the axis of symmetry. This was\r\nby no means a chance discovery. It was the result of much reflection on\r\nthe symmetry of crystalline matter, which enabled the brothers to\r\nforesee the possibilities of such polarization. The first part of the\r\ninvestigation was made in Friedel's laboratory. With an experimental\r\nskill rare at their age, the young men succeeded in making a complete\r\nstudy of the new phenomenon, established the conditions of symmetry\r\nnecessary to its production in crystals, and stated its remarkably\r\nsimple quantitative laws, as well as its absolute magnitude for certain\r\ncrystals. Several well-known scientists of other nations (Roentgen,\r\nKundt, Voigt, Riecke) have made further investigations along this new\r\nroad opened by Jacques and Pierre Curie.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the work, and much more difficult to realize\r\nexperimentally, concerned the compression resulting in piezo-electric\r\ncrystals when they are exposed to the action of an electric field. This\r\nphenomenon, foreseen by Lippmann, was demonstrated by the Curie\r\nbrothers. The difficulty of the experiment lay in the minuteness of the\r\ndeformations that had to be observed. Fortunately Desains and Mouton\r\nplaced a small room adjoining the physics laboratory at the disposal of\r\nthe brothers so that they might proceed successfully with their delicate\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nFrom these researches, as much theoretical as experimental, they\r\nimmediately deduced a practical application, in the form of a new\r\napparatus, a piezo-electric quartz electrometer, which measures in\r\nabsolute terms small quantities of electricity, as well as electric\r\ncurrents of low intensity. This apparatus has since then rendered great\r\nservice in experiments in radioactivity.[2]\r\n\r\nDuring the course of their experiments on piezo-electricity the Curies\r\nwere obliged to employ electrometric apparatus, and, not being able to\r\nuse the quadrant electrometer known at that time, they developed a new\r\nform of that instrument, better adapted to their necessities. This\r\nbecame known in France as the Curie electrometer. Thus these years of\r\ncollaboration between the two brothers, always intimately united, proved\r\nboth happy and fruitful. Their devotion and their common interest in\r\nscience were to them both a stimulant and a support. During their work\r\nthe vivacity and energy of Jacques were of precious aid to Pierre,\r\nalways more easily absorbed by his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHowever, this beautiful and close collaboration lasted only a few years.\r\nIn 1883, Pierre and Jacques were obliged to separate; Jacques left for\r\nthe University of Montpellier as Head Lecturer in Mineralogy (_Maître de\r\nConferences_). Pierre was made Director of Laboratory Work in the School\r\nof Industrial Physics and Chemistry founded by the city of Paris at the\r\nsuggestion of Friedel and of Schützenberger, who became its first\r\ndirector. Their remarkable researches with crystals won for the brothers\r\nin 1895--very late, it is true--the Planté prize.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pierre Curie did not leave a veritable diary but only a few\r\npages as chance permitted, covering but a short period of his life.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The piezo-electric property of quartz has recently had an\r\nimportant application; it has been utilized by P. Langevin in the\r\nproduction of elastic waves of high frequency (beyond sound) sent out in\r\nwater with the aim of detecting submarine obstacles. This same method\r\ncan serve in a more general manner to explore ocean depths. We see,\r\nhere, once again, how pure speculation can lead to discoveries that will\r\nbe useful later in unforeseen directions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nLIFE AS THE DIRECTOR OF LABORATORY WORK\r\nIN THE SCHOOL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY.\r\nGENERALIZATION OF THE PRINCIPLE\r\nOF SYMMETRY. INVESTIGATIONS OF MAGNETISM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the School of Physics, in the old buildings of the Collège\r\nRollin, that Pierre Curie was destined to work, first as Director of\r\nLaboratory Work, then as Professor, for twenty-two years, a period\r\ncovering practically the whole of his scientific life. His memory seemed\r\nto cling to these old buildings, now destroyed, in which he had passed\r\nall his days, returning only in the evening to his parents in the\r\ncountry. He counted himself fortunate since he enjoyed the favor of the\r\nFounder-Director Schützenberger, and the esteem and good will of his\r\nstudents, many of whom became his disciples and friends. In alluding to\r\nthis experience, at the close of an address delivered at the Sorbonne\r\nnear the end of his life, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I desire to recall here that we have made all our investigations in the\r\nSchool of Physics and Chemistry of the city of Paris. In all creative\r\nscientific work the influence of the surroundings in which one works is\r\nof great importance, and a part of the result is due to that influence.\r\nFor more than twenty years I have worked in the School of Physics and\r\nChemistry. Schützenberger, the first director of the School, was an\r\neminent scientist. I remember with gratitude that he procured for me\r\nopportunities for my own investigations when I was yet but an assistant.\r\nLater, he permitted Madame Curie to work beside me, an authorization\r\nwhich was at that time far from an ordinary innovation.\r\n\r\n\"Schützenberger allowed us all great liberty; his direction made itself\r\nfelt chiefly through his inspiring love of science. The professors of\r\nthe School of Physics and Chemistry, and the students who have gone from\r\nit, have created a kindly and stimulating atmosphere that has been\r\nextremely helpful to me. It is among the old students of the school that\r\nwe have found our collaborators and our friends. I am happy to be able,\r\nhere, to thank them all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe newly appointed director of the laboratory was, when he first\r\nassumed his duties, scarcely older than his students, who loved him\r\nbecause of his extreme simplicity of manner, which was much more that of\r\na comrade than of a master. Some of these students recall with emotion\r\ntheir work carried on with him and his discussion at the blackboard,\r\nwhere he readily allowed himself to be led to debate scientific matters\r\nto their great profit both in information and in kindled enthusiasm. At\r\na dinner given in 1903 by the Association of Former Students of the\r\nSchool, which he attended, he laughingly recalled an incident of this\r\nperiod. One day after lingering late with several students in the\r\nlaboratory, he found the door locked, and they all had to climb down\r\nfrom the first floor single file, along a pipe that ran near one of the\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nBecause of his reserve and shyness he did not make acquaintances easily,\r\nbut those whose work brought them near him loved him because of his\r\nkindliness. This was true of his subordinates during his entire life. In\r\nthe school his laboratory helper, whom he had aided under trying\r\ncircumstances, thought of him with the greatest gratitude, in fact, with\r\nveritable adoration.\r\n\r\nAlthough separated from his brother, he remained bound to him by their\r\nformer bond of love and confidence. During vacations, Jacques Curie\r\nwould come to him that they might renew again that valuable\r\ncollaboration to which both willingly sacrificed their periods of\r\nliberty. At times it was Pierre who joined Jacques, who was engaged in\r\nmaking a geological chart of the Auvergne country, and there they\r\ncovered together the daily distances necessary to the tracing of such a\r\nmap.\r\n\r\nHere are a few memories of these long walks, extracts from a letter\r\nwritten to me shortly before our marriage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have been very happy to pass a little time with my brother. We have\r\nbeen far from all immediate care, and so isolated by our manner of\r\nliving that we have not even been able to receive a letter, never\r\nknowing one night where we would sleep the next. At times it seemed to\r\nme that we had gone back to the days when we lived entirely together.\r\nThen we always arrived at the same opinions about all things, with the\r\nresult that it was no longer necessary for us to speak in order to\r\nunderstand each other. This was all the more astonishing because we\r\ndiffered so entirely in character.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of scientific investigation, one must recognize\r\nthat the nomination of Pierre Curie to the School of Physics and\r\nChemistry retarded from the very first his experimental research.\r\nIndeed, at the time of his appointment nothing yet existed in that\r\nestablishment; everything had to be created. Even the walls and the\r\npartitions were hardly yet in place. He had, therefore, to organize\r\ncompletely the laboratory and its work, and he acquitted himself of this\r\ntask in a remarkable manner, injecting into it the spirit of precision\r\nand originality so characteristic of him.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the laboratory work of the large number of students\r\n(thirty by promotion) was alone a strain on a young man, assisted as he\r\nwas only by one laboratory helper. The first years were, therefore, hard\r\nyears of assiduous work, of benefit chiefly to the students trained and\r\ndeveloped by the young laboratory director.\r\n\r\nHe himself profited by this enforced interruption of his experimental\r\nresearch by trying to complete his scientific studies and, in\r\nparticular, his knowledge of mathematics. At the same time he became\r\nengrossed in considerations of a theoretical nature on the relations\r\nbetween crystallography and physics.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 he published a memoir on questions of the order and repetition\r\nthat are at the base of the study of the symmetry of crystals. This was\r\nfollowed in the same year by a more general treatment of the same\r\nsubject. Another article on symmetry and its repetitions appeared in\r\n1885. In that year he published, too, a very important theoretical\r\nwork[3] on the formation of crystals, and the capillary constants of\r\nthe different faces.\r\n\r\nThis rapid succession of investigations shows how completely engrossed\r\nPierre Curie was in the subject of the physics of crystals. Both his\r\ntheoretical and his experimental research in this domain grouped itself\r\naround a very general principle, the principle of symmetry, that he had\r\narrived at step by step, and which he only definitely enunciated in\r\nmemoirs published between the years 1893 and 1895.\r\n\r\nThe following is the form, already classic, in which he made his\r\nannouncement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When certain causes produce certain effects, the elements of symmetry\r\nin the causes ought to reappear in the effects produced.\r\n\r\n\"When certain effects reveal a certain dissymmetry, this dissymmetry\r\nshould be apparent in the causes which have given them birth.\r\n\r\n\"The converse of these two statements does not hold, at least\r\npractically; that is to say, the effects produced can be more\r\nsymmetrical than their causes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe capital importance of this statement, perfect in its simplicity,\r\nlies in the fact that the elements of symmetry which it introduces are\r\nrelated to all the phenomena of physics without exception.\r\n\r\nGuided by an exhaustive study of the groups of symmetry which might\r\nexist in nature, Pierre Curie showed how one should use this revelation\r\nin character at once geometric and physical, in order to foresee whether\r\na particular phenomenon can reproduce itself, or whether its\r\nreproduction is impossible under the given conditions. At the beginning\r\nof a certain memoir, he insists in these terms:\r\n\r\n\"I think it is necessary to introduce into physics the ideas of symmetry\r\nfamiliar to crystallographers.\"\r\n\r\nHis work in this field is fundamental, and even though he was led away\r\nfrom it later by other investigations, he always retained a passionate\r\ninterest in the physics of crystals, as well as in projects of further\r\nresearch in this domain.\r\n\r\nThe principle of symmetry to which Pierre Curie had so eagerly devoted\r\nhimself is one of the small number of great principles which dominate\r\nthe study of the phenomena of physics, and which, having their root in\r\nideas derived by experiment, yet little by little detach themselves and\r\nassume a form more and more general and more and more perfect. It is in\r\nthis way that the idea of the equivalence of heat and of work, added to\r\nthe earlier notion of the equivalence of kinetic and potential energies,\r\nbrought about the establishment of the principle of the conservation of\r\nenergy whose application is entirely general. In the same way the law of\r\nthe conservation of mass grew out of the experiments of Lavoisier, which\r\nbelong to the foundations of chemistry. Recently an admirable synthesis\r\nhas made it possible for us to attain a still higher degree of\r\ngeneralization through the union of these two principles, for it has\r\nbeen proved that the mass of a body is proportional to its internal\r\nenergy. The study of electrical phenomena led Lippmann to announce the\r\ngeneral law of the conservation of electricity. The principle of Carnot,\r\nborn of considerations on the functioning of thermal machines, has\r\nacquired also so general a significance, that it made possible the\r\nforeseeing of the most probable character of spontaneous evolution for\r\nall material systems.\r\n\r\nThe principle of symmetry furnishes an example of an analogous\r\nevolution. To begin with, observation of Nature was able to suggest the\r\nidea of symmetry; though such observations reveal only imperfectly any\r\nregular dispositions in the aspects of animals and plants. The\r\nregularity becomes very much more perfect in the case of crystallized\r\nminerals. We may consider that Nature furnishes us the idea of a plane\r\nof symmetry and of an axis of symmetry. An object possesses a plane of\r\nsymmetry, or a plane of reflection, if this plane divides the object\r\ninto two parts, of which each one may be thought of as the image of the\r\nother reflected in the plane as in a mirror. It is this, approximately,\r\nthat occurs in the external appearance of man and of numerous animals.\r\nAn object possesses an axis of symmetry of the order _n_, if it\r\npreserves the same appearance after a rotation on this axis of the nth\r\npart of a revolution. Thus a regular flower of four petals has an axis\r\nof symmetry of the order four, or a quarternary axis. Crystals like those\r\nof rock salt or of alum possess many planes of symmetry and many axes of\r\nsymmetry of different orders.\r\n\r\nGeometry teaches us to study the elements of symmetry of a limited\r\nfigure such, for instance, as a polyhedron; and to discover the\r\nrelations between its parts which permit us to reunite different\r\nsymmetries in groups. The knowledge of these groups is of the greatest\r\nusefulness in establishing a rational classification of crystal forms in\r\na small number of systems each of which is derived from a simple\r\ngeometric form. Thus the regular octahedron belongs to the same system\r\nas the cube, for in the case of each the group formed by the axes and\r\nthe planes of symmetry is the same.\r\n\r\nIn the study of the physical properties of crystalline matter it is\r\nnecessary to take account of the symmetry of such matter. This is, in\r\ngeneral, _anisotropic_; that is to say, it has not the same properties\r\nin all directions. On the other hand, media such as glass or water are\r\nisotropic, having equivalent properties in all directions. It was the\r\nstudy of optics which first showed that the propagation of light in a\r\ncrystal is dependent upon the elements of symmetry in that crystal. The\r\nsame thing is true for the conduction of heat or electricity, for\r\nmagnetization, for polarization, etc.\r\n\r\nIt was in reflecting upon the relations between cause and effect that\r\ngovern these phenomena that Pierre Curie was led to complete and extend\r\nthe idea of symmetry, by considering it as a condition of space\r\ncharacteristic of the medium in which a given phenomenon occurs. To\r\ndefine this condition it is necessary to consider not only the\r\nconstitution of the medium but also its condition of movement and the\r\nphysical agents to which it is subordinated. Thus a right circular\r\ncylinder possesses a plane of symmetry perpendicular to its axis in its\r\nposition, and an infinity of planes of symmetry pass through its axis.\r\nIf the same cylinder is in rotation on its axis, the first plane of\r\nsymmetry persists, but all the others are suppressed. Furthermore, if an\r\nelectric current traverses the cylinder lengthwise, no plane of symmetry\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nIn every phenomenon the elements of symmetry compatible with its\r\nexistence may be determined. Certain elements can coexist with certain\r\nphenomena, but they are not necessary to them. That which is necessary\r\nis that certain ones among these elements shall not exist. It is\r\n_dissymmetry_ that creates the phenomenon. When several phenomena are\r\nsuperposed in the same system, the dissymmetries are added together.\r\n\"Works of Pierre Curie,\" page 127.\r\n\r\nIt was from the above considerations that Pierre Curie announced the\r\ngeneral law whose text, already cited, attains the highest degree of\r\ngeneralization. The synthesis thus obtained seems complete, and all that\r\nwas further needed was to deduce from it all the developments of which\r\nit admits.\r\n\r\nFor this it is convenient to define the particular symmetry of each\r\nphenomenon and to introduce a classification which makes clear the\r\nprincipal groups of symmetry. Mass, electric charge, temperature, have\r\nthe same symmetry, of a type called _scalar_, that of the sphere. A\r\ncurrent of water and a rectilineal electric current have the symmetry of\r\nan arrow, of the type _polar vector_. The symmetry of an upright\r\ncircular cylinder is of the type _tensor_. All of the physics of\r\ncrystals can be expressed in a form in which the particular phenomena in\r\nquestion are not specified, but in which are examined only the\r\ngeometrical and analytical relations between the types of quantities\r\nwhere certain ones are considered as causes and the other as effects.\r\n\r\nThus, the study of electrical polarization by the application of an\r\nelectric field becomes the examination of the relation between two\r\nsystems of vectors, and the writing out of a system of linear equations\r\nhaving 9 coefficients. The same system of equations holds for the\r\nrelation between an electric field and an electric current in\r\ncrystalline conductors; or for that between the temperature gradient and\r\nthe heat current, except that the meaning of the coefficients must be\r\nchanged. Similarly, a study of the general relations between a vector\r\nand a system of tensors can reveal all the characteristics of\r\npiezo-electric phenomena. And all the rich variety of the phenomena of\r\nelasticity depends on the relation between two sets of tensors which\r\nrequire, in principle, 36 coefficients.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing brief exposition reveals the high philosophic import of\r\nthese conceptions of symmetry which touch all natural phenomena, and\r\nwhose profound significance Pierre Curie so clearly set forth. It is\r\ninteresting in this connection to recall the relation which Pasteur saw\r\nbetween these same conceptions and the manifestations of life. \"The\r\nuniverse,\" he said, \"is a dissymmetric whole. I am led to believe that\r\nlife, as it is revealed to us, must be a function of the dissymmetry of\r\nthe universe, or of the consequences that it involves.\"\r\n\r\nAs his organization of his work in the School progressed, Pierre Curie\r\ncould begin to dream of going forward again with his experimental\r\nresearch. He could do so, however, only under most precarious\r\nconditions, for he had not even a laboratory for his personal work, nor\r\na room of any kind entirely at his disposition. Besides, he possessed no\r\nfunds to support his investigations. It was only after he had been\r\nseveral years at the School that he obtained, thanks to the influence of\r\nSchützenberger, a small annual subvention for his work. Up to that time\r\nthe materials necessary for him were provided, thanks to the kindness of\r\nhis superiors, to the extent possible, by drawing upon a very limited\r\ngeneral fund of the teaching laboratory. As for a place to work in, he\r\nhad to content himself with very little. He set up certain of his\r\nexperiments in the rooms of his pupils when these were not in use. But\r\nmore frequently he worked in an outside corridor running between a\r\nstairway and a laboratory. It was there that he conducted, in\r\nparticular, his long research on magnetism.\r\n\r\nThis abnormal state of affairs was manifestly prejudicial to his work,\r\nbut it had, nevertheless, the happy result of bringing his students\r\ncloser to him, for it allowed them, at times, to share in his personal\r\nscientific interests.\r\n\r\nHis return to experimental research is marked by a profound study of the\r\n\"direct reading periodic precision balance for least weights.\" (1889,\r\n1890, 1891.) In this balance, the use of small weights is suppressed by\r\nthe employment of a microscope by means of which one reads a micrometer\r\nattached to the extremity of one of the arms of the balance. The reading\r\nis made when the oscillation of the balance is arrested, which can occur\r\nvery rapidly, thanks to the use of pneumatic dampeners conveniently\r\nconstructed. This balance marks a considerable advance over old systems.\r\nIt has shown itself particularly valuable in laboratories for chemical\r\nanalysis, where the rapidity of the weighings is frequently a test of\r\nprecision. We can say that the introduction of the Curie balances marks\r\nan epoch in the construction of these instruments. The work done in this\r\nfield was far from empirical; it comprised a study of the theory of\r\ndamped movements and the construction of numerous curves established\r\nwith the aid of some of his students.\r\n\r\nIt was toward 1891 that Pierre Curie began a long series of\r\ninvestigations on the magnetic properties of bodies at divers\r\ntemperatures, from the normal up to 1400° C. These investigations,\r\ncovering years, were presented as a Doctor's thesis before the Faculty\r\nof Sciences of the University of Paris in 1895. In it he stated\r\nprecisely in the following few words the object and results of his work:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"From the point of view of their magnetic properties, bodies may be\r\ndivided into two groups: _diamagnetic_ bodies, bodies only feebly\r\nmagnetic, and _paramagnetic_ bodies.[4] At first sight the two groups\r\nseem entirely separate. The principal aim of this research has been to\r\ndiscover if there exist transitions between these two states of matter,\r\nand if it is possible to make a given body pass progressively through\r\nthem. To determine this I have examined the properties of a great number\r\nof bodies at temperatures differing as much as possible, in magnetic\r\nfields of varying intensities.\r\n\r\n\"My experiments failed to prove any relation between the properties of\r\n_diamagnetic_ and those of _paramagnetic_ bodies. _And the results\r\nsupport the theories which attribute magnetism and diamagnetism to\r\ncauses of a different nature_. On the contrary, the properties of\r\n_ferro-magnetic_ bodies and of bodies _feebly magnetic_ are intimately\r\nunited.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis experimental work presented many difficulties, for it necessitated\r\nthe measuring of very minute forces (of the order of ¹⁄₁₀₀ of a\r\nmilligramme weight) within a container where the temperature could\r\nattain 400° C.\r\n\r\nAs Pierre Curie well understood, the results he obtained are, from a\r\ntheoretic point of view, of fundamental importance. The Curie law,\r\naccording to which the coefficient of magnetization of a body feebly\r\nmagnetized varies in inverse ratio to the absolute temperature, is a\r\nremarkably simple law. It is quite comparable to the Gay-Lussac law\r\nrelating to the variation of the density of a perfect gas with the\r\ntemperature. In his well known theory of magnetism P. Langevin, in 1905,\r\ntook into account the Curie law and arrived again, theoretically, at the\r\ndifference between the origins of diamagnetism and paramagnetism. His\r\nwork, as well as the important investigations of P. Weiss, demonstrated\r\nthe accuracy of Pierre Curie's conclusions, as well as the importance of\r\nthe analogy that he perceived between the intensity of magnetization and\r\nthe density of a fluid--the paramagnetic state being comparable to a\r\ngaseous state, and the ferro-magnetic state to the state of\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this work, Pierre Curie spent some time in the search\r\nfor unknown phenomena whose existence did not seem, _a priori_,\r\nimpossible to him. He sought for bodies strongly diamagnetic, but found\r\nnone. He tried to discover, too, if there were bodies that acted as\r\nconductors of magnetism, and if magnetism can exist in a \"free state,\"\r\nlike electricity. Here also the result was negative. He never published\r\nany of these investigations, for he had the habit of thus engaging in\r\nthe pursuit of phenomena, often with little hope of success, solely for\r\nthe love of the unforeseen, and without ever thinking of publication.\r\n\r\nBecause of this entirely disinterested passion for scientific research\r\nthe presentation of a doctor's thesis which would give an account of\r\nthese early investigations had never appealed to him. He was already\r\nthirty-five years old when he decided to gather together, in such a\r\nthesis, the results of his beautiful work on magnetism.\r\n\r\nI have a very vivid memory of how he sustained his thesis before the\r\nexaminers, for he had invited me, because of the friendship that already\r\nexisted between us, to be present on the occasion. The jury was composed\r\nof Professors Bonty, Lippmann, and Hautefeuille. In the audience were\r\nsome of his friends, among them his aged father, extremely happy in his\r\nson's success. I remember the simplicity and the clarity of the\r\nexposition, the esteem indicated by the attitude of the professors, and\r\nthe conversation between them and the candidate which reminded one of a\r\nmeeting of the Physics Society. I was greatly impressed; it seemed to me\r\nthat the little room that day sheltered the exaltation of human thought.\r\n\r\nIn recalling this period in the life of Pierre Curie, between 1883 and\r\n1895, we can appreciate the great progress the young physicist had made\r\nwhile acting as Chief of Laboratory. He had succeeded during this time\r\nin organizing an entirely new teaching service; he had published an\r\nimportant series of theoretical memoirs, as well as the results of\r\nexperimental research of the first order. In addition, he had\r\nconstructed new apparatus of great perfection--and all this in spite of\r\nvery insufficient accommodations and resources. This achievement\r\nsuggests the distance he had traveled since the doubts and hesitations\r\nof his early youth in learning to discipline his methods of work, and to\r\nderive from them the full advantage of his exceptional capacities.\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed a growing esteem in France, and in foreign countries. He was\r\nlistened to with interest at the meetings of the learned societies\r\n(Society of Physics, Society of Mineralogy, Society of Electricians),\r\nwhere he was in the habit of presenting his communications and where he\r\njoined readily in the discussion of various scientific questions.\r\n\r\nAmong foreign scholars who already at this time appreciated him highly,\r\nI can name, in the first place, the illustrious English physicist, Lord\r\nKelvin, who joined with him in a certain scientific discussion, and who\r\noften expressed for him, from that time on, both esteem and sympathy.\r\nDuring one of his visits to Paris, Lord Kelvin was present at a meeting\r\nof the Society of Physics when Pierre Curie made a statement regarding\r\nthe construction and the use of standard condensers with guard ring. In\r\nthis statement he recommended the use of an apparatus which involved the\r\ncharging of the central part of the guard ring plate by a galvanic cell\r\nand in uniting the guard ring with the earth. One uses then, as a\r\nmeasure, the charge induced on the second plate. Even though the\r\nresulting disposition of lines of the field be complex, the charge\r\ninduced can be calculated by a theorem of electrostatics, with the same\r\nsimple formula as is used for an ordinary apparatus in a uniform field,\r\nand one has the benefit of a better isolation. Lord Kelvin believed at\r\nfirst that this reasoning was inexact. Despite his great repute and his\r\nadvanced age, he went the following day to the laboratory to find the\r\nyoung Director. Here he discussed the matter with him before the\r\nblackboard. He was completely convinced, and seemed even delighted to\r\nconcede the point to his companion.[5]\r\n\r\nIt may seem astonishing that Pierre Curie, in spite of his merits,\r\ncontinued during twelve years in the small position of Chief of\r\nLaboratory. Without doubt this was largely due to the fact that it is\r\neasy to overlook those who have not the active support of influential\r\npersons. It was due also to the fact that it was impossible for him to\r\ntake the many steps that the pushing of any candidature involves. Then,\r\ntoo, his independence of character ill fitted him to ask for an advance,\r\nand this notwithstanding the fact that his position was very modest.\r\nIndeed his salary, then comparable to that of a day laborer (about 300\r\nfrancs a month), was scarcely sufficient to enable him to lead the\r\nsimple life that would yet permit him to carry on his work.\r\n\r\nHe expressed his feelings on this subject in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have heard that perhaps one of the professors will resign, and that I\r\nmight, in that case, make application to succeed him. What an ugly\r\nnecessity is this of seeking any position whatsoever; I am not\r\naccustomed to this form of activity, demoralizing to the highest degree.\r\nI am sorry that I spoke to you about it. I think that nothing is more\r\nunhealthy to the spirit than to allow oneself to be occupied by things\r\nof this character and to listen to the petty gossip that people come to\r\nreport to you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf he disliked soliciting an advancement in position, he was even less\r\ninclined to hope for honors. He had, in fact, a very decided opinion on\r\nthe subject of honorary distinctions. Not only did he believe that they\r\nwere not helpful, but he considered them frankly harmful. He felt that\r\nthe desire to obtain them is a cause of trouble, and that it can degrade\r\nthe worthiest aim of man, which is, work for the pure love of it.\r\n\r\nSince he possessed great moral probity, he did not hesitate to make his\r\nacts conform to his opinions. When Schützenberger, in order to offer\r\nhim a mark of esteem, wished to propose him for the _Palmes\r\nacadémiques_ he refused this distinction, despite the advantages which,\r\naccording to general belief, it would confer. And he wrote to his\r\ndirector:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have been informed that you intend to propose me again to the\r\n_prefet_ for the decoration. I pray you do not do so. If you procure for\r\nme this honor, you will place me under the necessity of refusing it, for\r\nI have firmly decided not to accept a decoration of any kind. I hope\r\nthat you will be good enough to avoid taking a step that will make me\r\nappear a little ridiculous in the eyes of many people. If your aim is to\r\noffer me a testimony of your interest, you have already done that, and\r\nin a very much more effective manner which touched me greatly, for you\r\nhave made it possible for me to work without worry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFaithful to this firm opinion, he later declined the decoration of the\r\nLégion d'Honneur, which was offered him in 1903.\r\n\r\nBut even though Pierre Curie refused to take steps to change his\r\nsituation it was at last improved. In 1895 the well-known physicist,\r\nMascart, professor in the Collège de France, impressed with his\r\nability, and with Lord Kelvin's opinion of him, insisted that\r\nSchützenberger create a new Chair of Physics at the School of Physics\r\nand Chemistry. Pierre Curie was then named professor under conditions in\r\nwhich his talents were duly recognized. However, nothing was done at\r\nthis time to ameliorate the inadequate material conditions under which,\r\nas we have already seen, he was carrying on his personal investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: In this very brief memoir is presented, for the first time,\r\na theory which explains why crystals develop certain faces\r\nsimultaneously, in a particular direction, and consequently why crystals\r\npossess a determined form.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Paramagnetic_ bodies are those which are magnetized in the\r\nsame manner as iron, either strongly (_ferro-magnetic_) or feebly.\r\n_Diamagnetic_ bodies are those whose very feeble magnetization is\r\nopposed to that which iron takes in the same magnetic field.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The following is the text of a letter from this\r\ndistinguished savant to Pierre Curie, written during one of his visits\r\nto Paris:\r\n\r\n                   October, 1893.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR MR. CURIE:\r\n\r\n\"I am much obliged to you for your letter of Saturday and the\r\ninformation contained in it, which is exceedingly interesting to me.\r\n\r\n\"If I call at your laboratory between 10 and 11 tomorrow morning should\r\nI find you there? There are two or three things I would like to speak to\r\nyou about; and I would like also to see more of your curves representing\r\nthe magnetization of iron at different temperatures.\r\n\r\n                  \"Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                            \"KELVIN.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE AND ORGANIZATION OF THE FAMILY\r\nLIFE. PERSONALITY AND CHARACTER\r\n\r\n\r\nI met Pierre Curie for the first time in the spring of the year 1894. I\r\nwas then living in Paris where for three years I[6] had been studying at\r\nthe Sorbonne. I had passed the examinations for the licentiate in\r\nphysics, and was preparing for those in mathematics. At the same time I\r\nhad begun to work in the research laboratory of Professor Lippmann. A\r\nPolish physicist whom I knew, and who was a great admirer of Pierre\r\nCurie, one day invited us together to spend the evening with himself and\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the room, Pierre Curie was standing in the recess of a\r\nFrench window opening on a balcony. He seemed to me very young, though\r\nhe was at that time thirty-five years old. I was struck by the open\r\nexpression of his face and by the slight suggestion of detachment in his\r\nwhole attitude. His speech, rather slow and deliberate, his simplicity,\r\nand his smile, at once grave and youthful, inspired confidence. We began\r\na conversation which soon became friendly. It first concerned certain\r\nscientific matters about which I was very glad to be able to ask his\r\nopinion. Then we discussed certain social and humanitarian subjects\r\nwhich interested us both. There was, between his conceptions and mine,\r\ndespite the difference between our native countries, a surprising\r\nkinship, no doubt attributable to a certain likeness in the moral\r\natmosphere in which we were both raised by our families.\r\n\r\nWe met again at the Physics Society and in the laboratory. Then he asked\r\nif he might call upon me. I lived at that time in a room on the sixth\r\nfloor of a house situated near the schools. It was a poor little room,\r\nfor my resources were extremely limited. I was, nevertheless, very happy\r\nin it for I was now first realizing, although already twenty-five years\r\nold, the ardent desire I had so long cherished of carrying on advanced\r\nstudies in science.\r\n\r\nPierre Curie came to see me, and showed a simple and sincere sympathy\r\nwith my student life. Soon he caught the habit of speaking to me of his\r\ndream of an existence consecrated entirely to scientific research, and\r\nhe asked me to share that life. It was not, however, easy for me to make\r\nsuch a decision, for it meant separation from my country and my family,\r\nand the renouncement of certain social projects that were dear to me.\r\nHaving grown up in an atmosphere of patriotism kept alive by the\r\noppression of Poland, I wished, like many other young people of my\r\ncountry, to contribute my effort toward the conservation of our national\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nSo matters stood, when at the beginning of my vacation I left Paris to\r\ngo to my father in Poland. Our correspondence during this separation\r\nhelped to strengthen the bond of affection between us.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1894 Pierre Curie wrote me letters that seem to me\r\nadmirable in their form. No one of them was very long, for he had the\r\nhabit of concise expression, but all were written in a spirit of\r\nsincerity and with an evident anxiety to make the one he desired as a\r\ncompanion know him as he was. The very quality of the expression has\r\nalways seemed to me remarkable. No other one could describe in a few\r\nlines, as he could, a state of mind, or a situation, and by the simplest\r\nmeans make that description evoke a seizing image of truth. Because of\r\nthis gift, he might, I believe, have been a great writer. I have already\r\ncited a few fragments of his letters, and others will follow. It is\r\nappropriate to quote here a few lines which express how he looked on the\r\npossibility of our marriage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We have promised each other (is it not true?) to have, the one for the\r\nother, at least a great affection. Provided that you do not change your\r\nmind! For there are no promises which hold; these are things that do not\r\nadmit of compulsion.\r\n\r\n\"It would, nevertheless, be a beautiful thing in which I hardly dare\r\nbelieve, to pass through life together hypnotized in our dreams: your\r\ndream for your country; our dream for humanity; our dream for science.\r\nOf all these dreams, I believe the last, alone, is legitimate. I mean to\r\nsay by this that we are powerless to change the social order. Even if\r\nthis were not true we should not know what to do. And in working without\r\nunderstanding we should never be sure that we were not doing more harm\r\nthan good, by retarding some inevitable evolution. From the point of\r\nview of science, on the contrary, we can pretend to accomplish\r\nsomething. The territory here is more solid and obvious, and however\r\nsmall it is, it is truly in our possession.\r\n\r\n\"I strongly advise you to return to Paris in October. I shall be very\r\nunhappy if you do not come this year, but it is not my friend's\r\nselfishness that makes me ask you to return. I ask it because I believe\r\nyou will work better here and that you can accomplish here something\r\nmore substantial and more useful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOne can understand, from this letter, that for Pierre Curie there was\r\nonly one way of looking at the future. He had dedicated his life to his\r\ndream of science: he felt the need of a companion who could live his\r\ndream with him. He told me many times that the reason he had not married\r\nuntil he was thirty-six was because he did not believe in the\r\npossibility of a marriage which would meet this, his absolute necessity.\r\n\r\nWhen he was twenty-two years old he wrote in his diary:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Women, much more than men, love life for life's sake. Women of genius\r\nare rare. And when, pushed by some mystic love, we wish to enter into a\r\nlife opposed to nature, when we give all our thoughts to some work which\r\nremoves us from those immediately about us, it is with women that we\r\nhave to struggle, and the struggle is nearly always an unequal one. For\r\nin the name of life and of nature they seek to lead us back.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can see, however, in the letters I have quoted earlier, the\r\nunshakeable faith that Pierre Curie had in science and in its power to\r\nfurther the general good of humanity. It seems appropriate to apply to\r\nhim the sentiment expressed by Pasteur in words so well known: \"I\r\nbelieve invincibly that science and peace will triumph over ignorance\r\nand war.\"\r\n\r\nThis confidence in the solutions of science made Pierre Curie little\r\ninclined to take an active part in politics. He was attached, by\r\neducation and by conviction, to democratic and socialistic ideas, but he\r\nwas not dominated by any party doctrine. However, he always fulfilled,\r\nas his father did, his obligations as a voter. In public life, as in\r\nprivate life, he was opposed to the use of violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What would you think,\" he wrote me, \"of a person who would knock his\r\nhead against a stone wall with the intention of overthrowing it? Such an\r\nidea might be the result of very beautiful feelings, but in realization\r\nit would be ridiculous and stupid. I believe that certain questions\r\ndemand a general solution, and do not admit, today, of specific\r\nsolutions, and that one who begins a course that has no issue, may do\r\nmuch harm. I believe, further, that justice is not of this world, and\r\nthat the strongest system or rather the one best developed from the\r\neconomic point of view will be that which will stand. A man may exhaust\r\nhimself by work, and yet live, at best, miserably. This is a revolting\r\nfact, but it will not, because of that, cease. It will disappear\r\nprobably because man is a kind of machine, and it is of economic\r\nadvantage to make every machine work in its normal manner, without\r\nforcing it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe felt the same necessity for clarity and understanding in considering\r\nhis own inner life as in examining a general problem. A great necessity\r\nof loyalty to himself and toward others made him suffer from the\r\ncompromises imposed by life, even though he reduced them to a minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We are all the slaves of our affections,\" he wrote, \"slaves of the\r\nprejudices of those we love. Besides, we must make a living, and this\r\nforces us to become a wheel in the machine. The most painful are the\r\nconcessions we are forced to make to the prejudices of the society in\r\nwhich we live. We must make more or fewer compromises according as we\r\nfeel ourselves feebler or stronger. If one does not make enough\r\nconcessions he is crushed; if he makes too many he is ignoble and\r\ndespises himself. I find myself far from the principles I held ten years\r\nago. At that time I believed it necessary to be excessive in everything,\r\nand to make no concessions whatsoever to one's environment. I believed\r\nit necessary to exaggerate one's faults as well as one's virtues.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the _credo_ of the man who, without fortune himself, desired to\r\nshare his life with that of a student also without fortune, whom he had\r\nmet by chance.\r\n\r\nAfter my return from my vacation our friendship grew more and more\r\nprecious to us; each realized that he or she could find no better life\r\ncompanion. We decided, therefore, to marry, and the ceremony took place\r\nin July, 1895. In conformity with our mutual wish it was the simplest\r\nservice possible,--a civil ceremony, for Pierre Curie professed no\r\nreligion, and I myself did not practice any. My husband's parents\r\nreceived me with great cordiality, and reciprocally my father and my\r\nsisters, who were present at our marriage, were happy in knowing the\r\nfamily to which I was to belong.\r\n\r\nOur first home, an extremely simple one, consisted of a little apartment\r\nof three rooms in the rue de la Glacière, not far from the School of\r\nPhysics. Its chief attraction was its view of a large garden. It was\r\nfurnished very simply with objects that had belonged to our families.\r\nOur means did not permit our having servants, so that I had to assume\r\npractically all the household duties, as I had been in the habit of\r\ndoing during my student days.\r\n\r\nProfessor Curie's salary was 6000 francs a year, and we held that he\r\nshould not undertake any supplementary work, at least in the beginning.\r\nAs for myself, I was preparing to take the examination for the\r\n_agregation_ of young women, in view of obtaining a teaching post. These\r\nI passed in 1896. We ordered our life to suit our scientific work and\r\nour days were passed in the laboratory, where Schützenberger permitted\r\nthat I might work with my husband.\r\n\r\nHe was then engaged in a research on the growth of crystals, which\r\ninterested him keenly. He wished to know if certain faces of a crystal\r\nhad a preferential development chiefly because they have a different\r\nrapidity of growth or because their solubility is different. He quickly\r\nobtained interesting results (not published) but he had to interrupt his\r\ninvestigations to undertake others on radioactivity. And he often\r\nregretted that he was never able to return to them. I was occupied at\r\nthis time with the study of the magnetization of tempered steel.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of his class lectures was for Pierre Curie a genuine\r\ncare. The Chair was a new one, and carried no prescribed course of\r\nstudy. He divided his lectures, at first, between crystallography and\r\nelectricity. Then, as he recognized more and more the utility of a\r\nserious theoretical course in electricity for future engineers, he\r\ndevoted himself entirely to this subject, and succeeded in establishing\r\na course (of about 120 lectures) that was the most complete and modern\r\nthen to be had in Paris. This cost him a considerable effort, of which I\r\nwas the daily witness; for he was always anxious to give a complete\r\npicture of the phenomena and of the evolution of theories, and of ideas.\r\nHe was always anxious, too, that his mode of exposition should be clear\r\nand precise. He thought of publishing a treatise summing up this course,\r\nbut unfortunately the many preoccupations of the following years\r\nprevented him from putting this plan into execution.\r\n\r\nWe lived a very single life, interested in common, as we were, in our\r\nlaboratory experiments and in the preparation of lectures and\r\nexaminations. During eleven years we were scarcely ever separated, which\r\nmeans that there are very few lines of existing correspondence between\r\nus, representing that period. We spent our rest days and our vacations\r\nwalking or bicycling either in the country near Paris, or along the sea,\r\nor in the mountains. My husband was so engrossed in his researches,\r\nhowever, that it was very difficult for him to remain for any length of\r\ntime in a place where he lacked facilities for work. After a few days he\r\nwould say: \"It seems to me a very long time since we have accomplished\r\nanything.\" And yet he liked the excursions which covered successive\r\ndays, and enjoyed to the full our walks together, just as he had\r\nformerly enjoyed those with his brother. But his joy in seeing beautiful\r\nthings never drew his thoughts away from the scientific questions that\r\nabsorbed him. In these free times, we traversed the region of the\r\nCevennes and of the Monts d'Auvergne, as well as the coast of France,\r\nand some of its great forests.\r\n\r\nThese days in the open, filled with beautiful sights, made a deep\r\nimpression on us, and we loved to recall them. One of our radiant\r\nmemories was of a sunny day, when after a long and wearying climb, we\r\nreached the fresh, green meadow of the Aubrac, in the pure air of the\r\nhigh plateaus. Another vivid memory was that of an evening, when,\r\nlingering until twilight in the gorge of the Truyère, we were enchanted\r\nto hear a popular air dying away in the distance, carried to us from a\r\nlittle boat that descended the stream. We had taken so little notice of\r\nthe time that we did not regain our lodging before dawn. At one point we\r\nhad an encounter with carts whose horses were frightened by our\r\nbicycles, and we were obliged to cut across ploughed fields. At length\r\nwe regained our route on the high plateau, bathed in the unreal light of\r\nthe moon. And cows that were passing the night in enclosures came\r\ngravely to contemplate us with their large, tranquil eyes.\r\n\r\nThe forest of Compiegne charmed us in the spring, with its mass of green\r\nfoliage stretching far as the eye could see, and its periwinkles and\r\nanemones. On the border of the forest of Fontainebleau, the banks of the\r\nLoing, covered with water buttercups, were an object of delight for\r\nPierre Curie. We loved the melancholy coasts of Brittany and the reaches\r\nof heather and gorse, stretching to the very points of Finistère, which\r\nseemed like claws or teeth burying themselves in the water which forever\r\nrages at them.\r\n\r\nLater, when we had our baby with us, we passed our vacations in some one\r\nlocality, without traveling about. We lived then as simply as possible\r\nin retired villages where we could scarcely be distinguished from the\r\nvillagers themselves. I remember the stupefaction of an American\r\njournalist when he found us one day at Pouldu, at a moment when I was\r\nsitting on one of the stone steps of our house in the act of shaking the\r\nsand from my sandals. However, his embarrassment was short-lived and,\r\nadapting himself to the situation, he sat down beside me and began\r\njotting down in his notebook my answers to his questions.\r\n\r\nThe most affectionate relations existed between my husband's parents and\r\nmyself. We often went to Sceaux, where the room my husband used to have\r\nbefore our marriage was always reserved for us. I had also a very tender\r\naffection for Jacques Curie and his family (he was married and had two\r\nchildren); for Pierre's brother became mine, and has always remained so.\r\n\r\nOur eldest daughter, Irene, was born in September, 1897, and only a few\r\ndays afterwards my husband suffered a great loss in the death of his\r\nmother. Doctor Curie came to live with us in a house which had a garden\r\nand was situated on the old fortifications of Paris (108 Boulevard\r\nKellermann) near the park of Montsouris. Pierre Curie lived in this\r\nhouse until the end of his life.\r\n\r\nWith the birth of our child, the difficulties of carrying on our work\r\nwere augmented: for I had to give more time to the household. Very\r\nfortunately for us I could leave my little girl with her grandfather,\r\nwho much enjoyed taking care of her. But we had to think also of\r\nincreasing our resources to meet the needs of our larger family and to\r\nenable us to secure someone to help me in the house, a necessity from\r\nnow on. However, our situation remained as it was during the following\r\ntwo years, which we consecrated to intensive laboratory research on\r\nradioactivity. It was, indeed, not relieved until 1900, to the\r\ndetriment, it is true, of the amount of time we could give to our\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nAll formal social obligations were excluded from our life. Pierre Curie\r\nhad for such things an unconquerable repugnance. Neither in his earlier\r\nnor his later life would he pay visits or undertake to involve himself\r\nin relations without special interest. By nature grave and silent, he\r\npreferred to abandon himself to his own reflections, rather than to\r\nengage in an exchange of banal words. On the other hand, he valued\r\ngreatly his boyhood friends, and those to whom he was bound by a common\r\ninterest in science.\r\n\r\nAmong the latter, E. Gouy, professor of the faculty of sciences at Lyon,\r\nshould be named. His friendly relations with Pierre Curie dated from the\r\ntime when they were both preparators at the Sorbonne. They carried on\r\nregularly a scientific correspondence, and took great pleasure in seeing\r\neach other again during the various brief visits of E. Gouy to Paris, on\r\nwhich occasions they were inseparable. There existed also a friendship\r\nof long standing between my husband and Ch. Ed. Guillaume, now director\r\nof the International Bureau of Weights and Measures of Sèvres. They met\r\nat the Physics Society and occasionally on Sundays at Sèvres or Sceaux.\r\nLater a group of younger men formed themselves about Pierre Curie. They\r\nwere investigators engaged, as he was, in physical and chemical research\r\nin the newest fields of these sciences. Among these men were André\r\nDebierne, my husband's intimate friend and collaborator in the work on\r\nradioactivity; George Sagnac, his collaborator in a study of the X-rays;\r\nPaul Langevin, who became a professor in the Collège de France; Jean\r\nPerrin, at present professor of physical chemistry in the Sorbonne; and\r\nGeorges Urbain, student of the School of Physics and later professor in\r\nthe Sorbonne. Often one or the other came to see us in our quiet house\r\nin the Boulevard Kellermann. Then we engaged in discussions of recent or\r\nfuture experiments, or of new ideas and theories, and never tired of\r\nrejoicing over the marvelous development of modern physics.\r\n\r\nThere were not many large reunions in our house, for my husband did not\r\nfeel the need of them. He was more at his ease in a conversation with\r\nsome one or few persons, and rarely attended any meetings except those\r\nof the scientific societies. If by chance he found himself in a\r\ngathering where the general conversation did not interest him, he took\r\nrefuge in a tranquil corner where he could forget the company as he\r\npursued his own thoughts.\r\n\r\nOur relations with our families were very restricted on his side as on\r\nmine; for he had few relatives and mine were far away. He was, however,\r\nvery devoted to those of my family who could come to visit me in Paris,\r\nor during our vacations.\r\n\r\nIn 1899, Pierre Curie made a journey with me to the Carpathians of\r\nAustrian Poland, where one of my sisters, married to Doctor Dluski and\r\nherself a physician, directed, with him, a large sanatorium. Through a\r\ntouching desire to know all that was dear to me, my husband, though he\r\nknew little of foreign languages, wished to learn Polish, something\r\nwhich I had not thought of suggesting because I did not believe it could\r\nprove sufficiently useful to him. He felt a sincere sympathy for my\r\ncountry and believed in the future Establishment of a free Poland.\r\n\r\nIn our life together it was given to me to know him as he had hoped I\r\nmight, and to penetrate each day further into his thought. He was as\r\nmuch and much more than all I had dreamed at the time of our union. My\r\nadmiration of his unusual qualities grew continually; he lived on a\r\nplane so rare and so elevated that he sometimes seemed to me a being\r\nunique in his freedom from all vanity and from the littlenesses that one\r\ndiscovers in oneself and in others, and which one judges with indulgence\r\nalthough aspiring to a more perfect ideal.\r\n\r\nIn this lay, without doubt, the secret of that infinite charm of his to\r\nwhich one could not long rest insensible. His thoughtful expression and\r\nthe directness of his look were strongly attractive and this attraction\r\nwas increased by his kindliness and gentleness of character. He\r\nsometimes said that he never felt combative, and this was entirely true.\r\nOne could not enter into a dispute with him because he could not become\r\nangry. \"Getting angry is not one of my strong points,\" he would say,\r\nsmiling. If he had few friends, he had no enemies; for he could not\r\ninjure anyone, even by inadvertence. But at the same time no one could\r\nforce him to deviate from his line of action, something which led his\r\nfather to nickname him the \"gentle stubborn one.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he expressed his opinion he did so frankly, for he was convinced\r\nthat diplomatic methods are puerile, and that directness is at once\r\neasiest and best. Because of this practice, he acquired a certain\r\nreputation for naïveté; in reality he was acting on a well-considered\r\ndecision, rather than by instinct. It was perhaps because he was able to\r\njudge himself and to retire within himself, that he was so capable of\r\nclearly appreciating the springs of action, the intention, and the\r\nthoughts of others. And if he sometimes neglected details, he was rarely\r\ndeceived in the essentials. Usually he kept his sure judgments to\r\nhimself; but once he had made up his mind he sometimes expressed them\r\nwithout reticence, in the assurance that he was doing something useful.\r\n\r\nIn his scientific relations he showed no sharpness, and did not permit\r\nhimself to be influenced by considerations of personal credit or by\r\npersonal sentiments. Every beautiful success gave him pleasure, even if\r\nachieved in a domain where he felt himself to have priority. He said:\r\n\"What does it matter if I have not published such and such\r\ninvestigations, if another has published them?\" For he held that in\r\nscience we should be interested in things and not in persons. He was so\r\ngenuinely against every form of emulation that he opposed even the\r\ncompetitions and gradings of the lycées, as well as all forms of\r\nhonorary distinction. He never failed to give counsel and encouragement\r\nto any of those who showed an aptitude for science, and certain among\r\nthem still remain profoundly grateful to him.\r\n\r\nIf his attitude was that of one of the élite who have attained the\r\nhighest summit of civilization, his acts were those of a truly good man\r\nendowed with the sentiment of human solidarity intimately bound to his\r\nintellectual conceptions, and full of understanding and indulgence. He\r\nwas always ready to aid, as far as his means allowed, any person in a\r\ndifficult situation, even if helping meant giving some of his time,\r\nwhich was always the greatest sacrifice he could make. His generosity\r\nwas so spontaneous that one scarcely noticed it. He believed that the\r\nonly advantage of material means, beyond that of providing the\r\nnecessities of a simple life, was in the opportunity they offered of\r\naiding others, and of pursuing the work of one's preference.\r\n\r\nWhat shall I say, finally, of his love for his own, and of his qualities\r\nas friend? His friendship, which he gave rarely, was sure and faithful,\r\nfor it rested on a community of ideas and opinions. And still more\r\nrarely did he give affection; but how complete was his gift to his\r\nbrother and to me! He could forsake his customary reserve for an\r\nunconstraint which established harmony and confidence. His tenderness\r\nwas the most exquisite of blessings, sure and helpful, full of\r\ngentleness and solicitude. It was good to be surrounded by this\r\ntenderness; it was cruel to lose it after having lived in an atmosphere\r\ncompletely permeated by it. But I will let his own words tell how\r\ncompletely he gave himself:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I think of you who fill my life, and I long for new powers. It seems to\r\nme that in concentrating my mind exclusively upon you, as I am doing,\r\nthat I should succeed in seeing you, and in following what you are\r\ndoing; and that I should be able to make you feel that I am altogether\r\nyours at this moment,--but the image does not come.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were not warranted in having great confidence in our health, nor in\r\nour strength so often put to severe tests. And from time to time, as\r\nhappens to those who know the value of sharing a common life, the fear\r\nof the irreparable touched our minds. In such moments his simple courage\r\nled him always to the same inevitable conclusion: \"Whatever happens,\r\neven if one should become like a body without a soul, still one must\r\nalways work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The following are a few brief biographical details:\r\n\r\nMy name is Marie Sklodowska. My father and mother belonged to Catholic\r\nPolish families. Both were teachers in secondary schools in Warsaw (at\r\nthat time under Russia). I was born in Warsaw and attended a lycée\r\nthere. Following the lycée, I taught several years. Then in 1892 I came\r\nto Paris in order to study science.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE DREAM BECOME A REALITY. THE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already said that in 1897 Pierre Curie was occupied with an\r\ninvestigation on the growth of crystals. I myself had finished, by the\r\nbeginning of vacation, a study of the magnetization of tempered steels\r\nwhich had resulted in our getting a small subvention from the Society\r\nfor the Encouragement of National Industry. Our daughter Irene was born\r\nin September, and as soon as I was well again, I resumed my work in the\r\nlaboratory with the intention of preparing a doctor's thesis.\r\n\r\nOur attention was caught by a curious phenomenon discovered in 1896 by\r\nHenri Becquerel. The discovery of the X-ray by Roentgen had excited the\r\nimagination, and many physicians were trying to discover if similar rays\r\nwere not emitted by fluorescent bodies under the action of light. With\r\nthis question in mind Henri Becquerel was studying uranium salts, and,\r\nas sometimes occurs, came upon a phenomenon different from that he was\r\nlooking for: the spontaneous emission by uranium salts of rays of a\r\npeculiar character. This was the discovery of radioactivity.\r\n\r\nThe particular phenomenon discovered by Becquerel was as follows:\r\nuranium compound placed upon a photographic plate covered with black\r\npaper produces on that plate an impression analogous to that which light\r\nwould make. The impression is due to uranium rays that traverse the\r\npaper. These same rays can, like X-rays, discharge an electroscope, by\r\nmaking the air which surrounds it a conductor.\r\n\r\nHenri Becquerel assured himself that these properties do not depend on a\r\npreliminary isolation, and that they persist when the uranium compound\r\nis kept in darkness during several months. The next step was to ask\r\nwhence came this energy, of minute quantity, it is true, but constantly\r\ngiven off by uranium compounds under the form of radiations.\r\n\r\nThe study of this phenomenon seemed to us very attractive and all the\r\nmore so because the question was entirely new and nothing yet had been\r\nwritten upon it. I decided to undertake an investigation of it.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to find a place in which to conduct the experiments. My\r\nhusband obtained from the director of the School the authorization to\r\nuse a glassed-in study on the ground floor which was then being used as\r\na storeroom and machine shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Henri Manuel, Paris._\r\n\r\nPierre and Marie Curie in their laboratory, where radium was\r\ndiscovered.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to go beyond the results reached by Becquerel, it was necessary\r\nto employ a precise quantitative method. The phenomenon that best lent\r\nitself to measurement was the conductibility produced in the air by\r\nuranium rays. This phenomenon, which is called _ionization_, is produced\r\nalso by X-rays and investigation of it in connection with them had made\r\nknown its principal characteristics.\r\n\r\nFor measuring the very feeble currents that one can make pass through\r\nair ionized by uranium rays, I had at my disposition an excellent method\r\ndeveloped and applied by Pierre and Jacques Curie. This method consists\r\nin counterbalancing on a sensitive electrometer the quantity of\r\nelectricity carried by the current with that which a piezo-electric\r\nquartz can furnish. The installation therefore required a Curie\r\nelectrometer, a piezo-electric quartz, and a chamber of ionization,\r\nwhich last was formed by a plate condenser whose higher plate was joined\r\nto the electrometer, while the lower plate, charged with a known\r\npotential, was covered with a thin layer of the substance to be\r\nexamined. Needless to say, the place for such an electrometric\r\ninstallation was hardly the crowded and damp little room in which I had\r\nto set it up.\r\n\r\nMy experiments proved that the radiation of uranium compounds can be\r\nmeasured with precision under determined conditions, and that this\r\nradiation is an atomic property of the element of uranium. Its intensity\r\nis proportional to the quantity of uranium contained in the compound,\r\nand depends neither on conditions of chemical combination, nor on\r\nexternal circumstances, such as light or temperature.\r\n\r\nI undertook next to discover if there were other elements possessing the\r\nsame property, and with this aim I examined all the elements then known,\r\neither in their pure state or in compounds. I found that among these\r\nbodies, thorium compounds are the only ones which emit rays similar to\r\nthose of uranium. The radiation of thorium has an intensity of the same\r\norder as that of uranium, and is, as in the case of uranium, an atomic\r\nproperty of the element.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary at this point to find a new term to define this new\r\nproperty of matter manifested by the elements of uranium and thorium. I\r\nproposed the word radioactivity which has since become generally\r\nadopted; the radioactive elements have been called radio elements.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of my research, I had had occasion to examine not only\r\nsimple compounds, salts and oxides, but also a great number of minerals.\r\nCertain ones proved radioactive; these were those containing uranium and\r\nthorium; but their radioactivity seemed abnormal, for it was much\r\ngreater than the amount I had found in uranium and thorium had led me to\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\nThis abnormality greatly surprised us. When I had assured myself that it\r\nwas not due to an error in the experiment, it became necessary to find\r\nan explanation. I then made the hypothesis that the ores uranium and\r\nthorium contain in small quantity a substance much more strongly\r\nradioactive than either uranium or thorium. This substance could not be\r\none of the known elements, because these had already been examined; it\r\nmust, therefore, be a new chemical element.\r\n\r\nI had a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as\r\npossible. And Pierre Curie, keenly interested in the question, abandoned\r\nhis work on crystals (provisionally, he thought) to join me in the\r\nsearch for this unknown substance.\r\n\r\nWe chose, for our work, the ore pitchblende, a uranium ore, which in its\r\npure state is about four times more active than oxide of uranium.\r\n\r\nSince the composition of this ore was known through very careful\r\nchemical analysis, we could expect to find, at a maximum, 1 per cent of\r\nnew substance. The result of our experiment proved that there were in\r\nreality new radioactive elements in pitchblende, but that their\r\nproportion did not reach even a millionth per cent!\r\n\r\nThe method we employed is a _new method in chemical research based on\r\nradioactivity_. It consists in inducing separation by the ordinary means\r\nof chemical analysis, and of measuring, under suitable conditions, the\r\nradioactivity of all the separate products. By this means one can note\r\nthe chemical character of the radioactive element sought for, for it\r\nwill become concentrated in those products which will become more and\r\nmore radioactive as the separation progresses. We soon recognized that\r\nthe radioactivity was concentrated principally in two different chemical\r\nfractions, and we became able to recognize in pitchblende the presence\r\nof at least two new radioactive elements: polonium and radium. We\r\nannounced the existence of polonium in July, 1898, and of radium in\r\nDecember of the same year.[7]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this relatively rapid progress, our work was far from\r\nfinished. In our opinion, there could be no doubt of the existence of\r\nthese new elements, but to make chemists admit their existence, it was\r\nnecessary to isolate them. Now, in our most strongly radioactive\r\nproducts (several hundred times more active than uranium), the polonium\r\nand radium were present only as traces. The polonium occurred associated\r\nwith bismuth extracted from pitchblende, and radium accompanied the\r\nbarium extracted from the same mineral. We already knew by what methods\r\nwe might hope to separate polonium from bismuth and radium from barium;\r\nbut to accomplish such a separation we had to have at our disposition\r\nmuch larger quantities of the primary ore than we had.\r\n\r\nIt was during this period of our research that we were extremely\r\nhandicapped by inadequate conditions, by the lack of a proper place to\r\nwork in, by the lack of money and of personnel.\r\n\r\nPitchblende was an expensive mineral, and we could not afford to buy a\r\nsufficient quantity. At that time the principal source of this mineral\r\nwas at St. Joachimsthal (Bohemia) where there was a mine which the\r\nAustrian government worked for the extraction of uranium. We believed\r\nthat we would find all the radium and a part of the polonium in the\r\nresidues of this mine, residues which had so far not been used at all.\r\nThanks to the influence of the Academy of Sciences of Vienna, we secured\r\nseveral tons of these residues at an advantageous price, and we used it\r\nas our primary material. In the beginning we had to draw on our private\r\nresources to pay the costs of our experiment; later we were given a few\r\nsubventions and some help from outside sources.\r\n\r\nThe question of quarters was particularly serious; we did not know where\r\nwe could conduct our chemical treatments. We had been obliged to start\r\nthem in an abandoned storeroom across a court from the workroom where we\r\nhad our electrometric installation. This was a wooden shed with a\r\nbituminous floor and a glass roof which did not keep the rain out, and\r\nwithout any interior arrangements. The only objects it contained were\r\nsome worn pine tables, a cast-iron stove, which worked badly, and the\r\nblackboard which Pierre Curie loved to use. There were no hoods to carry\r\naway the poisonous gases thrown off in our chemical treatments, so that\r\nit was necessary to carry them on outside in the court, but when the\r\nweather was unfavorable we went on with them inside, leaving the windows\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A view of the extraction of radium in the old\r\nshed where the first radium was obtained.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this makeshift laboratory we worked practically unaided during two\r\nyears, occupying ourselves as much with chemical research as with the\r\nstudy of the radiation of the increasingly active products we were\r\nobtaining. Then it became necessary for us to divide our work. Pierre\r\nCurie continued the investigations on the properties of radium, while I\r\nwent ahead with the chemical experiments which had as their objective\r\nthe preparation of pure radium salts. I had to work with as much as\r\ntwenty kilogrammes of material at a time, so that the hangar was filled\r\nwith great vessels full of precipitates and of liquids. It was\r\nexhausting work to move the containers about, to transfer the liquids,\r\nand to stir for hours at a time, with an iron bar, the boiling material\r\nin the cast-iron basin. I extracted from the mineral the radium-bearing\r\nbarium and this, in the state of chloride, I submitted to a fractional\r\ncrystallization. The radium accumulated in the least soluble parts, and\r\nI believed that this process must lead to the separation of the chloride\r\nof radium. The very delicate operations of the last crystallizations\r\nwere exceedingly difficult to carry out in that laboratory, where it was\r\nimpossible to find protection from the iron and coal dust. At the end of\r\na year, results indicated clearly that it would be easier to separate\r\nradium than polonium; that is why we concentrated our efforts in this\r\ndirection. We examined the radium salts we obtained with the aim of\r\ndiscovering their powers and we loaned samples of the salts to several\r\nscientists,[8] in particular to Henri Becquerel.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1899 and 1900, Pierre Curie published with me a memoir\r\non the discovery of the induced radioactivity produced by radium. We\r\npublished another paper on the effects of the rays: the luminous\r\neffects, the chemical effects, etc.; and still another on the electric\r\ncharge carried by certain of the rays. And, finally, we made a general\r\nreport on the new radioactive substances and their radiations, for the\r\nCongress of Physics which met in Paris in 1900. My husband published,\r\nbesides, a study of the action of a magnetic field on radium rays.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pierre Curie with the quartz piezo-electroscope\r\nhe invented, by which rays of radium are measured.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main result of our investigations and of those of other scientists\r\nduring these years, was to make known the nature of the rays emitted by\r\nradium, and to prove that they belonged to three different categories.\r\nRadium emits a stream of active corpuscles moving with great speed.\r\nCertain of them carry a positive charge and form the Alpha rays; others,\r\nmuch smaller, carry a negative charge and form Beta rays. The movements\r\nof these two groups are influenced by a magnet. A third group is\r\nconstituted by the rays that are insensible to the action of a magnet,\r\nand that, we know to-day, are a radiation similar to light and to\r\nX-rays.\r\n\r\nWe had an especial joy in observing that our products containing\r\nconcentrated radium were all spontaneously luminous. My husband who had\r\nhoped to see them show beautiful colorations had to agree that this\r\nother unhoped-for characteristic gave him even a greater satisfaction\r\nthan that he had aspired to.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of 1900 offered us an opportunity to make known, at closer\r\nrange, to foreign scientists, our new radioactive bodies. This was one\r\nof the points on which the interest of this Congress chiefly centered.\r\n\r\nWe were at this time entirely absorbed in the new field that opened\r\nbefore us, thanks to the discovery so little expected. And we were very\r\nhappy in spite of the difficult conditions under which we worked. We\r\npassed our days at the laboratory, often eating a simple student's lunch\r\nthere. A great tranquillity reigned in our poor, shabby hangar;\r\noccasionally, while observing an operation, we would walk up and down\r\ntalking of our work, present and future. When we were cold, a cup of hot\r\ntea, drunk beside the stove, cheered us. We lived in a preoccupation as\r\ncomplete as that of a dream.\r\n\r\nSometimes we returned in the evening after dinner for another survey of\r\nour domain. Our precious products, for which we had no shelter, were\r\narranged on tables and boards; from all sides we could see their\r\nslightly luminous silhouettes, and these gleamings, which seemed\r\nsuspended in the darkness, stirred us with ever new emotion and\r\nenchantment.\r\n\r\nActually, the employees of the School owed Pierre Curie no service. But\r\nnevertheless the laboratory helper whom he had had to aid him when he\r\nwas laboratory chief had always continued to help him as much as he\r\ncould in the time at his disposal. This good man, whose name was Petit,\r\nfelt a real affection and solicitude for us, and many things were made\r\neasier because of his good will and the interest he took in our success.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A view of the extraction of radium in the old\r\nshed where the first radium was obtained.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had begun our research in radioactivity quite alone, but because of\r\nthe magnitude of the undertaking, we were more and more convinced of the\r\nutility of inviting collaboration. Already in 1898, one of the\r\nlaboratory chiefs of the School, G. Bemont, had given us temporary aid.\r\nAnd toward 1900 Pierre Curie associated with him a young chemist, André\r\nDebierne, preparator under Friedel, who held him in high esteem. André\r\nDebierne gladly accepted Pierre Curie's proposal that he occupy himself\r\nwith the investigation of radioactivity; and he undertook, in\r\nparticular, the search for a new radio element, which we suspected\r\nexisted in the iron group and in rare earths. He discovered the element\r\nactinium. Even though he carried on his work in the laboratory of\r\nphysical chemistry at the Sorbonne, directed by Jean Perrin, he\r\nfrequently came to visit us in our storeroom, and was soon an intimate\r\nfriend of ours, and of Doctor Curie and the children.\r\n\r\nAbout this same time, George Sagnac, a young physicist engaged in the\r\nstudy of X-rays, often came to discuss with my husband the analogies one\r\ncould expect to find between these rays, and their secondary rays, and\r\nthe radiations of radioactive bodies. They worked together on the\r\ninvestigation of the electric charge carried by the secondary rays.\r\n\r\nBesides our collaborators we saw very few persons in the laboratory;\r\nhowever, from time to time some physicist or chemist came to see our\r\nexperiments, or to ask Pierre Curie for advice or information; for his\r\nauthority in several branches of physics was very well recognized. And\r\nthen there were discussions before the blackboard,--discussions which\r\nare pleasantly remembered to-day, because they stimulated an interest in\r\nscience and an ardor for work without interrupting any course of\r\nreflection, and without troubling that atmosphere of peace and\r\ncontemplation which is the true atmosphere of the laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: This last publication was issued in common with G.\r\nBemont, who had collaborated with us in our experiments.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: I quote, as an example, a letter addressed to Pierre Curie\r\nby A. Paulsen, thanking him for radioactive products loaned him in 1899:\r\n\r\n                  \"Den Damke Nordl's Expedition\r\n                      Akureyi, 16 Oct. 1899.\r\n\r\nMonsieur, and most honored colleague,\r\n\r\n\"I thank you warmly for your letter of August 1, which I have just\r\nreceived in the north of Iceland.\r\n\r\n\"We have abandoned all the methods hitherto employed to establish in a\r\nfixed conductor the potential that exists at certain points in the mass\r\nof air that surrounds it, and are using only your radiant powder.\r\n\r\n\"Accept, Monsieur, and most honored colleague, my respectful salutations\r\nand my renewed thanks for the great services you have rendered my\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n                            \"ADAM PAULSEN.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR MEANS TO WORK. THE\r\nBURDEN OF CELEBRITY. THE FIRST ASSISTANCE\r\nFROM THE STATE. IT COMES TOO LATE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of our desire to concentrate our entire effort on the work in\r\nwhich we were engaged, and in spite of the fact that our needs were so\r\nmodest, we were forced to recognize, toward 1900, that some increase in\r\nour income was indispensable. Pierre Curie had few illusions about his\r\nchances of obtaining an important chair in the University of Paris,\r\nwhich would, even though it meant no large salary, have sufficed for the\r\nsmall needs of our family, and enabled us to live without a\r\nsupplementary revenue. Since he was neither a graduate of the Normal\r\nSchool nor of the Polytechnic, he lacked the support, often decisive,\r\nwhich these big schools give their pupils; and the posts to which he\r\nmight justly have aspired, because of his achievements, were given to\r\nothers, without anyone's even thinking of him as a possible candidate.\r\nAt the beginning of 1898, he asked, without success, for the Chair of\r\nPhysical Chemistry left vacant by the death of Salet, and this failure\r\nconvinced him that he had no chance of advancement. He was appointed,\r\nhowever, in March, 1900, to the position of assistant professor\r\n(_répétiteur_) in the Polytechnic School, but he kept his post only\r\nsix months.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1900, there came an unexpected offer, that of the Chair\r\nof Physics in the University of Geneva. The doyen of that University\r\nmade the invitation in the most cordial manner, and insisted that the\r\nUniversity was ready to make an exceptional effort to secure a scientist\r\nof such high repute. The advantages of this position were that the\r\nsalary was larger than the average one, that it carried the promise of\r\nthe development of a Physics Laboratory adequate to our needs, and that\r\nan official position for me would be provided in this laboratory. Such a\r\nproposition merited a most careful consideration, so we made a visit to\r\nthe University of Geneva, where our reception was the most encouraging\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThis was a grave decision for us to make. Geneva presented material\r\nadvantages, and the opportunity of a life comparable in its tranquillity\r\nwith that in the country. Pierre Curie was, therefore, tempted to\r\naccept, and it was only our immediate interest in our researches in\r\nradium that made him finally decide not to. He feared the interruption\r\nof our investigations which such a change must involve.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Chair of Physics in the physics, chemistry and\r\nnatural history course at the Sorbonne, obligatory for students of\r\nmedicine, and familiarly known as P.C.N., was vacant; he applied, and\r\nwas appointed, due to the influence of Henri Poincaré, who was anxious\r\nto free him from the necessity of quitting France. At the same time I\r\nwas given charge of the physics lectures in the Normal School for Girls\r\nat Sèvres.\r\n\r\nSo we remained in Paris, and with our income increased. But we were at\r\nthe same time working under increasingly difficult conditions. Pierre\r\nCurie was doing double teaching; and that in the P.C.N., with its very\r\nlarge number of students, fatigued him greatly. As for myself, I had to\r\ngive much time to the preparation of my lectures at Sèvres, and to the\r\norganization of the laboratory work there, which I found very\r\ninsufficient.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Pierre Curie's new position did not bring with it a\r\nlaboratory; a little office and a single work room were all that he had\r\nat his disposition in the annex (12 rue Cuvier) of the Sorbonne, which\r\nserved as teaching quarters for the P.C.N. And yet he felt it absolutely\r\nnecessary to go ahead with his own work. In fact, the rapid extension of\r\nhis investigations in radioactivity had made him determine that in his\r\nnew position at the Sorbonne he would receive students and start them in\r\nresearch. He therefore took steps to find larger available working\r\nquarters. Those who have taken similar steps realize the wall of\r\nfinancial and administrative obstacles against which he was throwing\r\nhimself, and realize the large number of official letters, visits, and\r\nof requests the least success entailed. All this thoroughly wearied and\r\ndiscouraged Pierre Curie. He was obliged, too, constantly, to keep\r\ntraveling back and forth between the laboratories of the P.C.N. and the\r\nhangar of the School of Physics where we still continued our work.\r\n\r\nAnd besides these difficulties, we found that we could not make further\r\nprogress without the aid of industrial means of treating our raw\r\nmaterial. Fortunately certain expedients and generous assistance solved\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1899 Pierre Curie succeeded in organizing a first industrial\r\nexperiment, using for it a chance installation placed at his disposition\r\nby the Central Society of Chemical Products, with which he had had\r\nrelations in connection with the construction of his balances. The\r\ntechnical details had been arranged very successfully by André\r\nDebierne, and the operations brought good results, even though it had\r\nbeen necessary to train a special personnel for this chemical work which\r\ndemanded special precautions.\r\n\r\nOur investigations had started a general scientific movement, and\r\nsimilar work was being undertaken in other countries. Toward these\r\nefforts Pierre Curie maintained a most disinterested and liberal\r\nattitude. With my agreement he refused to draw any material profit from\r\nour discovery. We took no copyright, and published without reserve all\r\nthe results of our research, as well as the exact processes of the\r\npreparation of radium. In addition, we gave to those interested whatever\r\ninformation they asked of us. This was of great benefit to the radium\r\nindustry, which could thus develop in full freedom, first in France,\r\nthen in foreign countries, and furnish to scientists and to physicians\r\nthe products which they needed. This industry still employs to-day, with\r\nscarcely any modifications, the processes indicated by us.[9]\r\n\r\nEven though our industrial experiment yielded good results, again our\r\nslender resources made it difficult to make further progress. Inspired\r\nby our attempt, a French industrial, Armet de Lisle, had the idea, which\r\nseemed daring at that epoch, of founding a veritable radium factory that\r\nwould furnish this product to physicians, whose interest in the\r\nbiological effects of radium and its possible therapeutic applications\r\nhad been aroused by the publication of various investigations. The\r\nproject proved a success because he could employ men already trained by\r\nus in the delicate processes of this manufacture. Radium was then\r\nregularly placed on sale, at a high price, it is true, because of the\r\nspecial conditions under which it had to be made, and because, too, of\r\nthe immediate rise in the cost of the minerals necessary to its\r\nproduction.[10]\r\n\r\nI should like to express, here, our appreciation of the spirit in which\r\nArmet de Lisle offered to cooperate with us. In an entirely\r\ndisinterested manner he placed at our disposition a little working place\r\nin his factory and a part of the means necessary for us to use it. Other\r\nfunds were added either by ourselves, or came through subventions, of\r\nwhich the most important, accorded in 1902 by the Academy of Sciences,\r\namounted to 20,000 francs.\r\n\r\nIt was in this way that we were able to utilize the ore we had acquired\r\nlittle by little in the preparation of a certain quantity of radium,\r\nwhich we used constantly in our research. The radium-bearing barium was\r\nextracted in the factory, and I carried on its purification and\r\nfractional crystallization in the laboratory. In 1902 I succeeded in\r\npreparing a decigramme of chloride of pure radium which gave only the\r\nspectrum of the new element, radium. I made a first determination of the\r\natomic weight of this new element, an atomic weight much higher than\r\nthat of barium. Thus the chemical individuality of radium was completely\r\nestablished, and the reality of radioelements was a known fact about\r\nwhich there could be no further controversy.\r\n\r\nI based my doctor's thesis, presented in 1903, on these investigations.\r\n\r\nLater, the quantity of radium extracted for the laboratory was\r\nincreased, and in 1907 I was able to make a second and more precise\r\ndetermination of the atomic weight as 225.35--one accepts now the number\r\n226. I succeeded, too, jointly with André Debierne, in obtaining radium\r\nin the state of metal. The total quantity of radium I prepared and gave\r\nto the laboratory, in agreement with Pierre Curie's desire, amounted to\r\nmore than a gramme of radium element.\r\n\r\nThe activity of pure radium exceeded all our expectations. For equal\r\nweights this substance emits a radiation more than a million times more\r\nintense than uranium. To offset this, the quantity of radium contained\r\nin uranium minerals is scarcely more than three decigrammes of radium to\r\nthe ton of uranium. There is a very close relation between these two\r\nsubstances. In fact, we know to-day that radium is produced in the\r\nminerals at the expense of uranium.\r\n\r\nThe years that followed his nomination to the P.C.N. were hard for\r\nPierre Curie. He had to face the many anxieties incident to the\r\norganization of a complicated system of work when his happiness depended\r\non his being able to concentrate his efforts on a single determined\r\nsubject. The physical fatigue due to the numerous courses he was obliged\r\nto give was so great that he suffered from attacks of acute pain, which\r\nin his overtaxed condition became more and more frequent.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore vitally important, if he was to spare his energy and\r\nkeep his health, that the burden of his professional duties be\r\nlightened. He decided to apply for the Chair of Mineralogy, which was\r\nvacant, at the Sorbonne, for which he was entirely qualified because of\r\nhis profound knowledge and his important publications on the theories of\r\nthe physics of crystals. Yet his candidacy failed.\r\n\r\nDuring this painful period he nevertheless managed, by a truly\r\nsuperhuman effort, successfully to complete and publish several\r\ninvestigations that he had made either alone or in collaboration:\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestigations on induced radioactivity (in collaboration\r\n  with A. Debierne).\r\n\r\nInvestigations on the same subject (in collaboration\r\n  with J. Danne).\r\n\r\nInvestigations on the conductibility provoked in\r\n  dielectric liquids by the rays of radium and the\r\n  Roentgen rays.\r\n\r\nInvestigations on the law of the decrease of the\r\n  emanation of radium and on the radioactive\r\n  constants that characterize this emanation and\r\n  its active deposit.\r\n\r\nDiscovery of the liberation of heat produced by\r\n  radium (in collaboration with A. Laborde).\r\n\r\nInvestigations on the diffusion of the emanation of\r\n  radium in the air (in collaboration with J.\r\n  Danne).\r\n\r\nInvestigation on the radioactivity of gases from\r\n  thermal springs (in collaboration with A.\r\n  Laborde).\r\n\r\nInvestigation on the physiological effects of\r\n  radium rays (in common with Henri Becquerel).\r\n\r\nInvestigation on the physiological action of the\r\n  radium emanation (in common with Bouchard\r\n  and Balthazard).\r\n\r\nNotes on the apparatus for the determination of\r\n  magnetic constants (in common with C. Cheneveau).\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these investigations in radioactivity are fundamental and touch very\r\nvaried subjects. Several have as their aim the study of the emanation,\r\nthat strange gaseous body that radium produces and which is largely\r\nresponsible for the intense radiation commonly attributed to the radium\r\nitself. Pierre Curie demonstrated by a searching examination the\r\nrigorous and invariable law according to which the emanation destroys\r\nitself, no matter what the conditions are in which it finds itself.\r\nTo-day the emanation of radium, harvested in tiny phials, is commonly\r\nemployed by physicians as a therapeutic agent. Technical considerations\r\nmake its employment preferable to the direct use of radium, and in this\r\ncase no physician can proceed without consulting the numerical chart\r\nwhich tells how much of this emanation has disappeared each day, despite\r\nthe fact that it is cloistered in its little glass prison. It is this\r\nsame emanation that is found in small quantities in mineral waters, and\r\nthat plays a part in their curative effects.\r\n\r\nMore striking still was the discovery of the discharge of heat from\r\nradium. Without any alteration in appearance this substance releases\r\neach hour a quantity of heat sufficient to melt its own weight of ice.\r\nWhen well protected against this external loss, radium heats itself. Its\r\ntemperature can rise 10 degrees or more above that of the surrounding\r\natmosphere. This defied all contemporary scientific experience.\r\n\r\nFinally, I cannot pass in silence, because of their various\r\nrepercussions, the experiments connected with the physiological effects\r\nof radium.\r\n\r\nIn order to test the results that had just been announced by F. Giesel,\r\nPierre Curie voluntarily exposed his arm to the action of radium during\r\nseveral hours. This resulted in a lesion resembling a burn, that\r\ndeveloped progressively and required several months to heal. Henri\r\nBecquerel had by accident a similar burn as a result of carrying in his\r\nvest pocket a glass tube containing radium salt. He came to tell us of\r\nthis evil effect of radium, exclaiming in a manner at once delighted and\r\nannoyed: \"I love it, but I owe it a grudge!\"\r\n\r\nSince he realized the interest in these physiological effects of radium,\r\nPierre Curie undertook, in collaboration with physicians, the\r\ninvestigations to which I have just referred, submitting animals to the\r\naction of radium emanation. These studies formed the point of departure\r\nin radium therapy. The first attempts at treatment with radium were made\r\nwith products loaned by Pierre Curie, and had as their object the cure\r\nof lupus and other skin lesions. Thus radium therapy, an important\r\nbranch of medicine, and frequently designated as _Curietherapie_, was\r\nborn in France, and was developed first through the investigations of\r\nFrench physicians (Danlos, Oudin, Wickham, Dominici, Cheron, Degrais,\r\nand others).[11]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the great impetus given to the study of radioactivity\r\nabroad led to a rapid succession of new discoveries. Many scientists\r\nengaged in the search for other radio elements, using the new method of\r\nchemical analysis, with the aid of radiation, that we had inaugurated.\r\nThus were found the mesothorium now used by physicians and manufactured\r\nindustrially, radio-thorium, ionium, protoactinium, radio-lead, and\r\nother substances. At present we know, in all, about thirty radio\r\nelements (among which three are gases, or emanations), but among them\r\nall radium still plays the most important part, because of the great\r\nintensity of its radiation, which diminishes only extremely slowly\r\nduring the course of years.\r\n\r\nThe year 1903 was especially important in the development of the new\r\nscience. In this year the investigation of radium, the new chemical\r\nelement, was achieved, and Pierre Curie demonstrated the astonishing\r\ndischarge of heat by this element, which nevertheless remained unaltered\r\nin appearance. In England, Ramsay and Soddy announced a great discovery.\r\nThey proved that radium continually produces helium gas and under\r\nconditions that force one to believe in an atomic transformation. If,\r\nindeed, radium salt heated to its melting point is confined for some\r\ntime in a sealed glass tube, entirely emptied of air, one can, in\r\nreheating it, make it throw off a small quantity of helium, easy to\r\nmeasure and to recognize from the character of its spectrum. This\r\nfundamental experiment has received numerous confirmations. It furnished\r\nus the first example of a transformation of atoms, independent, it is\r\ntrue, of our will, but at the same time it reduces to nothing the theory\r\nof the absolute fixity of the atomic edifice.\r\n\r\nAll these facts, along with others formerly known, were made the object\r\nof a synthesis of the highest value, in a work by E. Rutherford and F.\r\nSoddy, who proposed a theory of radioactive transformations, to-day\r\nuniversally adopted. According to this theory, each radio element, even\r\nwhen it appears unchanged, is undergoing a spontaneous transformation,\r\nand the more rapid the transformation, the more intense is the\r\nradiation.[12]\r\n\r\nA radioactive atom can transform itself in two ways: it can expel from\r\nitself an atom of helium, which, thrown off at an enormous speed and\r\nwith a positive charge, constitutes an Alpha ray. Or, instead, it can\r\ndetach from its structure a much smaller fragment, one of those\r\nelectrons to which we have become accustomed in modern physics, and\r\nwhose mass, 1800 times smaller than that of an atom of hydrogen when its\r\nspeed is moderate, grows excessively when its speed approaches that of\r\nlight. These electrons, which carry a negative charge, form the Beta\r\nrays. Whatever the detached fragment, the residual atom no longer\r\nresembles the primitive atom. Thus when the atom of radium has expelled\r\nan atom of helium, the residue is an atom of gaseous emanation. This\r\nresidue changes in its turn, and the process is not arrested until the\r\nattainment of a last residue which is stable and does not give off any\r\nradiation. This stable matter is inactive matter.\r\n\r\nThus the Alpha and Beta rays result from the fragmentation of atoms.\r\nGamma-rays are a radiation analogous to light, which accompanies the\r\ncataclysm of the atomic transformation. They are very penetrating, and\r\nare the ones most used in the therapeutic methods so far developed.[13]\r\n\r\nWe can see in all this that radio elements form families, in which each\r\nmember derives from a preceding member by direct descent the primary\r\nelements being uranium and thorium. We can in particular prove that\r\nradium is a descendant of uranium, and that polonium is a descendant of\r\nradium. Since each radio element, at the same time that it is formed by\r\nthe mother substance, destroys itself, it cannot accumulate in the\r\npresence of this mother substance beyond a determined proportion, which\r\nexplains why the relation between radium and uranium remains constant in\r\nthe very ancient unaltered minerals.\r\n\r\nThe spontaneous destruction of radio elements takes place according to a\r\nfundamental law, called the _exponential law_, according to which the\r\nquantity of each radio element diminishes by one-half in a time always\r\nthe same, called a period, this time-period making it possible to\r\ndetermine without ambiguity the element under consideration. These\r\nperiods, which can be measured by diverse methods, vary greatly. The\r\nperiod of uranium is several billions of years; that of radium is about\r\n1600 years; that of its emanation a little less than four days; and\r\nthere are among the following descendants some whose period is the small\r\nfraction of a second. The exponential law has a profound philosophic\r\nbearing; it indicates that the transformation is produced according to\r\nthe laws of probability. The causes that determine the transformation\r\nare a mystery to us, and we do not yet know if they derive from causal\r\nconditions outside the atom, or from conditions of internal instability.\r\nIn many cases, up to the present, no exterior action has shown itself\r\neffective in influencing the transformation.\r\n\r\nThis rapid succession of discoveries which overthrew familiar scientific\r\nconceptions long held in physics and chemistry did not fail to meet, at\r\nfirst, with doubts and incredulity. But the great part of the scientific\r\nworld received them with enthusiasm. At the same time Pierre Curie's\r\nfame grew in France and in foreign countries. Already in 1901 the\r\nAcademy of Sciences had awarded him the Lacaze prize. In 1902, Mascart,\r\nwho had many times given him most valuable aid, decided to propose him\r\nas a member of the Academy of Sciences. It was not easy for Pierre Curie\r\nto agree to this, believing, as he did, that the Academy should elect\r\nits members without the necessity of any preliminary solicitation or\r\npaying of calls. Nevertheless, because of the friendly insistence of\r\nMascart, and above all because the Physics Section of the Academy had\r\nalready declared itself unanimously in his favor, he presented himself.\r\nIn spite of this, however, he failed of election, and it was only in\r\n1905 that he became a member of the Institute, a membership which did\r\nnot last even a year. He was also elected to several academies and\r\nscientific societies in other countries, and given an honorary doctor's\r\ndegree by several universities.\r\n\r\nDuring 1903 we went to London at the invitation of the Royal\r\nInstitution, before which my husband was to lecture on radium. On this\r\noccasion he had a most enthusiastic reception. He was especially happy\r\nto see here again Lord Kelvin, who had always expressed an affection for\r\nhim, and who, despite his advanced age, preserved an interest,\r\nperennially young, in science. The illustrious scientist showed, with\r\ntouching satisfaction, a glass vial containing a grain of radium salt\r\nthat Pierre Curie had given him. We met here also other celebrated\r\nscientists, as Crookes, Ramsay, and J. Dewar. In collaboration with the\r\nlatter, Pierre Curie published investigations on the discharge of heat\r\nby radium at very low temperatures, and upon the formation of helium in\r\nradium salt.\r\n\r\nA few months later the Davy medal was conferred upon him (and also upon\r\nme) by the Royal Society of London, and at almost the same time, we\r\nreceived, together with Henri Becquerel, the Nobel prize for physics.\r\nOur health prevented us from attending the ceremony for the awarding of\r\nthis prize in December, and it was only in June, 1905, that we were able\r\nto go to Stockholm where Pierre Curie gave his Nobel lecture. We were\r\nmost cordially received and had the felicity of seeing the admirable\r\nSwedish nature in its most brilliant aspect.\r\n\r\nThe award of the Nobel prize was an important event for us because of\r\nthe prestige carried by the Nobel foundation, only recently founded\r\n(1901). Also, from a financial point of view, the half of the prize\r\nrepresented an important sum. It meant that in the future Pierre Curie\r\ncould turn over his teaching in the School of Physics to Paul Langevin,\r\none of his former students, and a physicist of great competence. He\r\ncould also engage a preparator to aid him in his work.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time the publicity this very happy event entailed bore\r\nvery heavily on a man who was neither prepared for it, nor accustomed to\r\nit. There followed an avalanche of visits, of letters, of demands for\r\narticles and lectures, which meant a constant enervation, fatigue, and\r\nloss of time. He was kind and did not like to refuse a request; but on\r\nthe other hand, he had to recognize that he could not accede to the\r\nsolicitations that overwhelmed him without disastrous results to his\r\nhealth, as well as to his peace of mind, and his work. In a letter to\r\nCh. Ed. Guillaume, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"People ask me for articles and lectures, and after a few years are\r\npassed, the very persons who make these demands will be astonished to\r\nsee that we have not accomplished any work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in other letters of the same period, written to E. Gouy, he\r\nexpressed himself as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \"20 March 1902\r\n\r\n\"As you have seen, fortune favors us at this moment; but these favors of\r\nfortune do not come without many worries. We have never been less\r\ntranquil than at this moment. There are days when we scarcely have time\r\nto breathe. And to think that we dreamed of living in the wild, quite\r\nremoved from human beings!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \"22 January 1904\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND:\r\n\r\n\"I have wanted to write to you for a long time; excuse me if I have not\r\ndone so. The cause is the stupid life which I lead at present. You have\r\nseen this sudden infatuation for radium, which has resulted for us in\r\nall the advantages of a moment of popularity. We have been pursued by\r\njournalists and photographers from all countries of the world; they have\r\ngone even so far as to report the conversation between my daughter and\r\nher nurse, and to describe the black-and-white cat that lives with\r\nus.... Further, we have had a great many appeals for money.... Finally,\r\nthe collectors of autographs, snobs, society people, and even at times,\r\nscientists, have come to see us--in our magnificent and tranquil\r\nquarters in the laboratory--and every evening there has been a\r\nvoluminous correspondence to send off. With such a state of things I\r\nfeel myself invaded by a kind of stupor. And yet all this turmoil will\r\nnot perhaps have been in vain, if it results in my getting a chair and\r\na laboratory. To tell the truth, it will be necessary to create the\r\nchair, and I shall not have the laboratory at first. I should have\r\npreferred the reverse, but Liard wishes to take advantage of the present\r\nmoment to bring about the creation of a new chair that will later be\r\nacquired for the university. They are to establish a chair without a\r\nfixed program, which will be something like a course in the Collège de\r\nFrance, and I believe I shall be obliged to change my subject each year,\r\nwhich will be a great trial to me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \"31 January 1905\r\n\r\n\"... I have had to give up going to Sweden. We are, as you see, most\r\nirregular in our relations with the Swedish Academy; but, to tell the\r\ntruth, I can only keep up by avoiding all physical fatigue. And my wife\r\nis in the same condition; we can no longer dream of the great work days\r\nof times gone by.\r\n\r\n\"As to research, I am doing nothing at present. With my course, my\r\nstudents, apparatus to install, and the interminable procession of\r\npeople who come to disturb me without serious reason, the days pass\r\nwithout my having been able to achieve anything useful at this end.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \"25 July 1905\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND:\r\n\r\n\"We have regretted so much being deprived of your visit this year, but\r\nhope to see you in October. If we do not make an effort from time to\r\ntime, we end by losing touch with our best and most congenial friends,\r\nand in keeping company with others for the simple reason that it is easy\r\nto meet them.\r\n\r\n\"We continue to lead the same life of people who are extremely occupied,\r\nwithout being able to accomplish anything interesting. It is now more\r\nthan a year since I have been able to engage in any research, and I have\r\nno moment to myself. Clearly I have not yet discovered a means to defend\r\nourselves against this frittering away of our time which is nevertheless\r\nextremely necessary. Intellectually, it is a question of life or death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \"7 November 1905\r\n\r\n\"I begin my course tomorrow but under very bad conditions for the\r\npreparation of my experiments. The lecture room is at the Sorbonne, and\r\nmy laboratory is in the rue Cuvier. Besides, a great number of other\r\ncourses are given in the same lecture room, and I can use it only one\r\nmorning for the preparation of my own.\r\n\r\n\"I am neither very well, nor very ill; but I am easily fatigued, and I\r\nhave left but very little capacity for work. My wife, on the contrary,\r\nleads a very active life, between her children, the School at Sèvres,\r\nand the laboratory. She does not lose a minute, and occupies herself\r\nmore regularly than I can with the direction of the laboratory in which\r\nshe passes the greater part of the day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo sum up: despite these outside complications, our life, by a common\r\neffort of will, remained as simple and as retired as formerly. Toward\r\nthe close of 1904 our family was increased by the birth of a second\r\ndaughter. Eve Denise was born in the modest house in Boulevard\r\nKellermann, where we still lived with Doctor Curie, seeing only a few\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nAs our elder daughter grew up, she began to be a little companion to her\r\nfather, who took a lively interest in her education and gladly went for\r\nwalks with her in his free times, especially on his vacation days. He\r\ncarried on serious conversations with her, replying to all her questions\r\nand delighting in the progressive development of her young mind. From\r\ntheir early age, his children enjoyed his tender affection, and he never\r\nwearied of trying to understand these little beings, in order to be able\r\nto give them the best he had to give.\r\n\r\nWith his great success in other countries, the complete appreciation of\r\nPierre Curie in France, however tardily, did at last follow. At\r\nforty-five he found himself in the first rank of French scientists and\r\nyet, as a teacher, he occupied an inferior position. This abnormal state\r\nof affairs aroused public opinion in his favor, and under the influence\r\nof this wave of feeling, the director of the Academy of Paris, L. Liard,\r\nasked Parliament to create a new professorship in the Sorbonne, and at\r\nthe beginning of the academic year 1904-05 Pierre Curie was named\r\ntitular professor of the Faculty of Sciences of Paris. A year later he\r\ndefinitely quitted the School of Physics where his substitute, Paul\r\nLangevin, succeeded him.\r\n\r\nThis new professorship was not established without a few difficulties.\r\nThe first project had provided for a new chair, but not for a\r\nlaboratory. And Pierre Curie felt that he could not accept a situation\r\nwhich involved the risk of losing even the mediocre means of work that\r\nhe then had, instead of offering better ones. He wrote, therefore, to\r\nhis chiefs, that he had decided to remain at the P.C.N. His firmness won\r\nthe day. To the new chair was added a fund for a laboratory and\r\npersonnel for the new work (a chief of laboratory, a preparator, and a\r\nlaboratory boy). The position of chief of laboratory was offered to me,\r\nwhich was a cause of very great satisfaction to my husband.\r\n\r\nIt was not without regret that we left the School of Physics, where we\r\nhad known such happy work days, despite their attendant difficulties. We\r\nhad become particularly attached to our hangar, which continued to\r\nstand, though in a state of increasing decay, for several years, and we\r\nwent to visit it from time to time. Later it had to be pulled down to\r\nmake way for a new building for the Physics School, but we have\r\npreserved photographs of it. Warned of its approaching destruction by\r\nthe faithful Petit, I made my last pilgrimage there, alas, alone. On the\r\nblackboard there was still the writing of him who had been the soul of\r\nthe place; the humble refuge for his research was all impregnated with\r\nhis memory. The cruel reality seemed some bad dream; I almost expected\r\nto see the tall figure appear, and to hear the sound of the familiar\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nEven though Parliament had voted the creation of a new chair, it did not\r\ngo so far as to consider the simultaneous founding of a laboratory which\r\nwas, nevertheless, necessary to the development of the new science of\r\nradioactivity. Pierre Curie therefore kept the little workroom at the\r\nP.C.N., and secured as a temporary solution of his difficulty the use of\r\na large room, then not being used by the P.C.N. He arranged, too, to\r\nhave a little building consisting of two rooms and a study set up in the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nOne cannot help feeling sorrow in realizing that this was a last\r\nconcession, and that actually one of the first French scientists never\r\nhad an adequate laboratory to work in, and this even though his genius\r\nhad revealed itself as early as his twentieth year. Without doubt if he\r\nhad lived longer, he would have had the benefit of satisfactory\r\nconditions for his work, but he was still deprived of them at his death\r\nat the premature age of forty-eight. Can we fully imagine the regret of\r\nan enthusiastic and disinterested worker in a great work, who is\r\nretarded in the realization of his dream by the constant lack of means?\r\nAnd can we think without a feeling of profound grief of the waste--the\r\none irreparable one--of the nation's greatest asset: the genius, the\r\npowers, and the courage of its best children?\r\n\r\nPierre Curie had always in mind his urgent need for a good laboratory.\r\nWhen, because of his great reputation, his chiefs felt obliged to try to\r\ninduce him, in 1903, to accept the decoration of the Légion d'Honneur,\r\nhe declined that distinction, remaining true to the opinion already\r\nreferred to in a preceding chapter. And the letter he wrote on this\r\noccasion was inspired by the same feeling as that in the one previously\r\nquoted, when he wrote to his director to refuse the _palmes\r\nacadémiques_. I quote an extract:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I pray you to thank the Minister, and to inform him that I do not in\r\nthe least feel the need of a decoration, but that I do feel the greatest\r\nneed for a laboratory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter he was named professor at the Sorbonne, Pierre Curie had to\r\nprepare a new course. The position had been given a very personal\r\ncharacter and a very general scope. He was left great freedom in the\r\nchoice of the matter he would present. Taking advantage of this freedom\r\nhe returned to a subject that was dear to him, and devoted part of his\r\nlectures to the laws of symmetry, the study of fields of vectors and\r\ntensors, and to the application of these ideas to the physics of\r\ncrystals. He intended to carry these lessons further, and to work out a\r\ncourse that would completely cover the physics of crystallized matter\r\nwhich would have been especially useful because this subject was so\r\nlittle known in France. His other lessons dealt with radioactivity, set\r\nforth the discoveries made in this new domain, and the revolution they\r\nhad caused in science.\r\n\r\nEven though he was very much absorbed in the preparation of his course,\r\nand often ill, my husband continued, nevertheless, to work in the\r\nlaboratory, which was becoming better and better organized. He had a\r\nlittle more space now, and could receive a few students. In\r\ncollaboration with A. Laborde, he carried on investigations in mineral\r\nwaters and gases discharged from springs. This was the last work he\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nHis intellectual faculties were at this time at their height. One could\r\nbut admire the surety and rigor of his reasoning on the theories of\r\nphysics, his clear comprehension of fundamental principles, and a\r\ncertain profound sense of phenomena which he had by instinct, but which\r\nhe perfected during the course of a life entirely consecrated to\r\nresearch and reflection. His skill in experiment, remarkable from the\r\nbeginning, was increased by practice. He experienced the pleasure of an\r\nartist when he succeeded with a delicate installation. He enjoyed, too,\r\ndevising and constructing new apparatus, and I used jokingly to tell him\r\nthat he would not be happy unless he made at least an attempt of this\r\nkind once every six months. His natural curiosity and vivid imagination\r\npushed him to undertakings in very varied directions; he could change\r\nthe object of his research with surprising ease.\r\n\r\nHe was scrupulously careful of scientific probity and of complete\r\naccuracy in his publications. These are very perfect in form, and none\r\nthe less so in those parts where he applies the critical spirit to\r\nhimself, expressing his determination never to affirm anything that does\r\nnot seem entirely clear. He expresses his thought on this point in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In the study of unknown phenomena, one can make very general hypotheses\r\nand then advance step by step with the help of experience. This method\r\nof progress is sure but necessarily slow. One can, on the contrary, make\r\ndaring hypotheses in which he specifies the mechanism of phenomena. Such\r\na method of procedure has the advantage of suggesting certain\r\nexperiments, and, above all, of facilitating reasoning by rendering it\r\nless abstract through the employment of an image. But on the other hand,\r\none cannot hope thus to conceive a complex theory in accord with\r\nexperiment. The precise hypothesis almost certainly includes a portion\r\nof error along with a portion of truth. And this last portion, if it\r\nexists, forms only a part of a more general proposition to which it will\r\nbe necessary in the end to return.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, even though he never hesitated to make hypotheses, he never\r\npermitted their premature publication. He could never accustom himself\r\nto a system of work which involved hasty publications, and was always\r\nhappier in a domain in which but a few investigators were quietly\r\nworking. The considerable vogue of radioactivity made him wish to\r\nabandon this field of research for a time, and to return to his\r\ninterrupted studies of the physics of crystals. He dreamed also of\r\nmaking an examination of diverse theoretical questions.\r\n\r\nHe gave much thought to his teaching, which constantly improved, and\r\nwhich suggested to him ideas on the general orientation of studies and\r\non methods of teaching, which he believed should be based on contact\r\nwith experience and nature. He hoped to see his views adopted by the\r\nAssociation of Professors as soon as it was formed, and to obtain the\r\ndeclaration \"that the teaching of the sciences must be the dominant\r\nteaching of both the boys' and girls' lycées.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he said, \"such a notion would have little chance of success.\"\r\n\r\nBut this last period of his life, so fecund, was, alas, soon to end. His\r\nadmirable scientific career was to be suddenly broken at the very moment\r\nwhen he could hope that the years of work to come would be less hard\r\nthan those which had preceded.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, quite ill and tired, he went with me and the children to spend\r\nEaster in the Chevreuse Valley. Those were two sweet days under a mild\r\nsun, and Pierre Curie felt the weight of weariness lighten in a healing\r\nrepose near to those who were dear to him. He amused himself in the\r\nmeadows with his little girls, and talked with me of their present and\r\ntheir future.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Paris for a reunion and dinner of the Physics Society.\r\nThere he sat beside Henri Poincaré and had a long conversation with him\r\non methods of teaching. As we were returning on foot to our house, he\r\ncontinued to develop his ideas on the culture that he dreamed of, happy\r\nin the consciousness that I shared his views.\r\n\r\nThe following day, the 19th of April, 1906, he attended a reunion of the\r\nAssociation of Professors of the Faculties of the Sciences, where he\r\ntalked with them very cordially about the aims which the Association\r\nmight adopt. As he went out from this reunion and was crossing the rue\r\nDauphine, he was struck by a truck coming from the Pont Neuf, and fell\r\nunder its wheels. A concussion of the brain brought instantaneous death.\r\n\r\nSo perished the hope founded on the wonderful being who thus ceased to\r\nhe. In the study room to which he was never to return, the water\r\nbuttercups he had brought from the country were still fresh.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: During my recent visit to America, where a gramme of radium\r\nwas generously offered me by American women, the Buffalo Society of\r\nNatural Sciences presented me, as a souvenir, with a publication\r\nreviewing the development of the radium industry in the United States.\r\nThis included photographic reproductions of letters from Pierre Curie in\r\nwhich he replied in as complete a manner as possible to the questions\r\nasked by American engineers. (1902 and 1903.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The price of a milligramme of the element of radium was\r\nthen fixed at about 750 francs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: These physicians were aided by the manufacturer, Armet de\r\nLisle, who placed at their disposition the radium needed for their first\r\nundertakings. He founded, besides, in 1906, a laboratory for clinical\r\nstudy, provided with a supply of radium. And he subventioned the first\r\nspecial publication devoted to radioactivity and its applications, as a\r\njournal under the name _Radium_, edited by J. Danne. This is an example\r\nof generous support of science by industry, in reality still very rare\r\nbut which one wishes might become general, in the common interest of\r\nthese two branches of human activity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: The hypothesis according to which radioactivity is bound\r\nup with the atomic transformation of elements was first envisaged by\r\nPierre Curie and by me, along with other possible hypotheses, before it\r\nwas utilized by E. Rutherford. (See _Revue Scientifique_, 1900, Mme.\r\nCurie, etc.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: By using the unusual energy of Alpha-rays E. Rutherford\r\nhas obtained recently the rupture of certain light atoms, like those of\r\nnitrogen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE NATION'S SORROW. THE LABORATORIES:\r\n\"SACRED PLACES\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to describe the grief of the family left by Pierre\r\nCurie. By what I have earlier said in this narrative one can understand\r\nwhat he meant to his father, his brother, and his wife. He was, too, a\r\ndevoted father, tender in his love for his children, and happy to occupy\r\nhimself with them. But our daughters were still too young at this time\r\nto realize the calamity that had befallen us. Their grandfather and I,\r\nunited in our common suffering, did what we could to see that their\r\nchildhood should not be too much darkened by the disaster.\r\n\r\nThe news of the catastrophe caused veritable consternation in the\r\nscientific world of France, as well as in that of other countries. The\r\nheads of the university and the professors expressed their emotion in\r\nletters full of sympathy, and a great number of foreign scientists also\r\nsent letters and telegrams. No less deep was the impression produced on\r\nthe public with whom Pierre Curie, despite his reserve, enjoyed great\r\nrenown. This feeling was expressed in numerous private letters coming\r\nnot only from those whom we knew, but also from persons entirely unknown\r\nto us. At the same time the press printed articles of regret, bearing\r\nthe stamp of deep sincerity. The French government sent its condolences,\r\nand a few rulers of foreign countries sent their personal expressions of\r\nsympathy. One of the purest glories of France had been extinguished, and\r\neach understood that this was a nation's sorrow.[14]\r\n\r\nFaithful to the memory of him who had left us, we wished a simple\r\ninterment in the family vault in the little cemetery at Sceaux. There\r\nwas neither official ceremony nor address, and only his friends\r\naccompanied him to his last home. As he thought of him who was no more,\r\nhis brother Jacques said to me: \"He had all the gifts; there were not\r\ntwo like him.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to assure the continuance of his work, the Faculty of Sciences\r\nof Paris paid me the very great honor of asking me to take the place\r\nthat he had occupied. I accepted this heavy heritage, in the hope that I\r\nmight build up some day, in his memory, a laboratory worthy of him,\r\nwhich he had never had, but where others would be able to work to\r\ndevelop his idea. This hope is now partly realized, thanks to the common\r\ninitiative of the University and the Pasteur Institute, which have aimed\r\nat the creation of a Radium Institute, composed of two laboratories, the\r\nCurie and the Pasteur, destined for the physicochemical and the\r\nbiological study of radium rays. In touching homage to him who had\r\ndisappeared the new street leading to the Institute was named rue Pierre\r\nCurie.\r\n\r\nThis Institute is, however, insufficient in view of the considerable\r\ndevelopment of radioactivity and of its therapeutic applications. The\r\nbest authorized persons now recognize that France must possess a Radium\r\nInstitute comparable to those of England and America for the\r\n_Curietherapie_ which has become an efficacious means in the battle\r\nagainst cancer. It is to be hoped that with generous and far-seeing aid,\r\nwe shall have, in a few years, a Radium Institute complete and enlarged,\r\nworthy of our country.\r\n\r\nTo honor the memory of Pierre Curie, the French Society of Physics\r\ndecided to issue a complete publication of his works. This publication,\r\narranged by P. Langevin and C. Cheneveau, comprises but a single volume\r\nof about 600 pages, which appeared in 1908, and for which I wrote a\r\npreface. This unique volume, which includes a work as important as it is\r\nvaried, is a faithful reflection of the mentality of the author. One\r\nfinds in it a great richness of ideas and of experimental facts leading\r\nto clear and well-established results, but the exposition is limited to\r\nthe strictly necessary, and is irreproachable, one might even say\r\nclassical, in form. It is to be regretted that Pierre Curie did not use\r\nhis gifts as scientist and author in writing extended memoirs or books.\r\nIt was not the desire that was lacking; he had several cherished\r\nprojects of this nature. But he could never put them into execution\r\nbecause of the difficulties with which he had to struggle during all his\r\nworking life.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, let us glance at this narrative as a whole, in which I have\r\nattempted to evoke the image of a man who, inflexibly devoted to the\r\nservice of his ideal, honored humanity by an existence lived in silence,\r\nin the simple grandeur of his genius and his character. He had the faith\r\nof those who open new ways. He knew that he had a high mission to fulfil\r\nand the mystic dream of his youth pushed him invincibly beyond the usual\r\npath of life into a way which he called anti-natural because it\r\nsignified the renunciation of the pleasures of life. Nevertheless, he\r\nresolutely subordinated his thoughts and desires to this dream, adapting\r\nhimself to it and identifying himself with it more and more completely.\r\nBelieving only in the pacific might of science and of reason, he lived\r\nfor the search of truth. Without prejudice or _parti pris_, he carried\r\nthe same loyalty into his study of things that he used in his\r\nunderstanding of other men and of himself. Detached from every common\r\npassion, seeking neither supremacy nor honors, he had no enemies, even\r\nthough the effort he had achieved in the control of himself had made of\r\nhim one of those elect whom we find in advance of their time in all the\r\nepochs of civilization. Like them he was able to exercise a profound\r\ninfluence merely by the radiation of his inner strength.\r\n\r\nIt is useful to learn how much sacrifice such a life represents. The\r\nlife of a great scientist in his laboratory is not, as many may think, a\r\npeaceful idyll. More often it is a bitter battle with things, with one's\r\nsurroundings, and above all with oneself. A great discovery does not\r\nleap completely achieved from the brain of the scientist, as Minerva\r\nsprang, all panoplied, from the head of Jupiter; it is the fruit of\r\naccumulated preliminary work. Between the days of fecund productivity\r\nare inserted days of uncertainty when nothing seems to succeed, and when\r\neven matter itself seems hostile; and it is then that one must hold out\r\nagainst discouragement. Thus without ever forsaking his inexhaustible\r\npatience, Pierre Curie used sometimes to say to me: \"It is nevertheless\r\nhard, this life that we have chosen.\"\r\n\r\nFor the admirable gift of himself, and for the magnificent service he\r\nrenders humanity, what reward does our society offer the scientist? Have\r\nthese servants of an idea the necessary means of work? Have they an\r\nassured existence, sheltered from care? The example of Pierre Curie, and\r\nof others, shows that they have none of these things; and that more\r\noften, before they can secure possible working conditions, they have to\r\nexhaust their youth and their powers in daily anxieties. Our society, in\r\nwhich reigns an eager desire for riches and luxury, does not understand\r\nthe value of science. It does not realize that science is a most\r\nprecious part of its moral patrimony. Nor does it take sufficient\r\ncognizance of the fact that science is at the base of all the progress\r\nthat lightens the burden of life and lessens its suffering. Neither\r\npublic powers nor private generosity actually accord to science and to\r\nscientists the support and the subsidies indispensable to fully\r\neffective work.\r\n\r\nI invoke, in closing, the admirable pleading of Pasteur:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If the conquests useful for humanity touch your heart, if you are\r\noverwhelmed before the astonishing results of electric telegraphy, of\r\nthe daguerrotype, of anesthesia, and of other wonderful discoveries, if\r\nyou are jealous of the part your country may claim in the spreading of\r\nthese marvelous things, take an interest, I beg of you, in those sacred\r\nplaces to which we give the expressive name of laboratories. Demand that\r\nthey be multiplied and ornamented, for these are the temples of the\r\nfuture, of wealth, and of well-being. It is in them that humanity grows,\r\nfortifies itself, and becomes better. There it may learn to read in the\r\nworks of nature the story of progress and of universal harmony, even\r\nwhile its own creations are too often those of barbarism, fanaticism,\r\nand destruction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMay this truth be widely spread, and deeply penetrate public opinion,\r\nthat the future may be less hard for the pioneers who must open up new\r\ndomains for the general good of humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extracts from Published Appreciations_\r\n\r\n\r\nI have chosen certain extracts from various published appreciations of\r\nPierre Curie in order to complete my account by a few moving testimonies\r\nfrom eminent men of science.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Henri Poincaré_:\r\n\r\n\"Curie was one of those on whom Science and France believed they had the\r\nright to count. His age permitted far-reaching hopes; what he had\r\nalready given seemed a promise, and we knew that, living, he would not\r\nhave failed. On the night preceding his death (pardon this personal\r\nmemory) I sat next to him and he talked with me of his plans and his\r\nideas. I admired the fecundity and the depth of his thought, the new\r\naspect which physical phenomena took on when looked at through that\r\noriginal and lucid mind. I felt that I better understood the grandeur of\r\nhuman intelligence--and the following day, in an instant, all was\r\nannihilated. A stupid accident brutally reminded us how little place\r\nthought holds in the face of the thousand blind forces that hurl\r\nthemselves across the world without knowing whither they go, crushing\r\nall in their passage.\r\n\r\n\"His friends, his colleagues understood at once the import of the loss\r\nthey suffered, but the grief extended far beyond them. In foreign\r\ncountries the most illustrious scientists joined in trying to show the\r\nesteem in which they held our compatriot, while in our own land there\r\nwas no Frenchman, however ignorant, who did not feel more or less\r\nvaguely what a force his nation and humanity had lost.\r\n\r\n\"Curie brought to his study of physical phenomena I do not know what\r\nvery fine sense which made him divine unsuspected analogies, and made it\r\npossible for him to orient himself in a labyrinth of complex appearances\r\nwhere others would have gone astray.... True physicists, like Curie,\r\nneither look within themselves, nor on the surface of things, but they\r\nknow how to look through things.\r\n\r\n\"All those who knew him knew their pleasure and surety in his\r\nacquaintance, and the delicate charm that was exhaled, one might say, by\r\nhis gentle modesty, by his naïve directness, by the fineness of his\r\nspirit. Always ready to efface himself before his family, before his\r\nfriends, and even before his rivals, he was what one calls a 'poor\r\ncandidate'; but in our democracy candidates are the least thing we lack.\r\n\r\n\"Who would have thought that so much gentleness concealed an\r\nintransigeant soul? He did not compromise with those general principles\r\non which he was nourished, nor with the particular moral ideal he had\r\nbeen taught to love, that ideal of absolute sincerity, too high,\r\nperhaps, for the world in which we live. He did not know the thousand\r\nlittle accommodations with which our weakness contents itself. Moreover,\r\nhe never separated the worship of this ideal from what he rendered to\r\nscience, and he gave us a shining example of the high conception of duty\r\nthat may spring from a simple and pure love of truth. It matters little\r\nin what God he believed; it is not the God, but faith, that performs\r\nmiracles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Institut de France_: Written about P. Curie by M. D. Gernez.\r\n\r\n\"All for work, all for science: this sums up the life of Pierre Curie, a\r\nlife so rich in brilliant discoveries and in the outlook of genius that\r\nit won him practically universal admiration. In the full maturity of his\r\ninvestigations whose progress he so eagerly pursued his work was ended,\r\nto the consternation of us all, by a terrible catastrophe on the 19th of\r\nApril, 1906....\r\n\r\n\"All these honors did not dazzle him; he was and he will remain a\r\nremarkable figure among those who make the scientific history of our\r\nepoch. His contemporaries found in him a precious example of a devotion\r\nto science at once unyielding and disinterested. There have been few\r\nlives more pure and more justly famous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jean Perrin_:\r\n\r\n\"Pierre Curie, whom all called a master, and whom we had the joy to\r\ncall, too, our friend, died suddenly in the fullness of his powers....\r\nWe will try to show through him, as an example, what part a powerful\r\ngenius can return to sincerity, to liberty, to the strong and calm\r\naudacity of thought which nothing can enchain and nothing can astonish.\r\nWe acknowledge also all the greatness of the soul where these fine\r\nqualities of intelligence and character were united in a most noble\r\nunselfishness and most exquisite goodness.\r\n\r\n\"Those who have known Pierre Curie, know that, near him one felt awaken\r\nthe need to do and to understand. We will try to honor his memory by\r\nspreading abroad this impression, and we will ask his pale and beautiful\r\nface for the secret of that radiation which made all those who\r\napproached him better men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. Cheneveau_:\r\n\r\n\"... In order to realize our irreparable loss we must remember Curie's\r\nattachment to his students.... Some of us offered him, with reason, a\r\nveritable worship.... For myself, he was, next to my own family, one of\r\nthose I loved most. How well he knew how to surround his simple\r\ncollaborator with a great and tender affection. His immense kindness\r\nextended even to his most humble helpers, who adored him. I have never\r\nseen more sincere and more heart-breaking tears than those shed by the\r\nlaboratory boys on the news of his sudden death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paul Langevin_:\r\n\r\n\"... The hours when one could meet him and in which one loved to talk\r\nabout his science and in which one thought with him, return each day to\r\nrecall his memory, to bring back his kindly and thoughtful face, his\r\nluminous eyes and his beautiful, expressive head modeled by twenty-five\r\nyears passed in the laboratory, and by a life of unremittent work and\r\ncomplete simplicity.\r\n\r\n\"... It is in his laboratory that my memories, still so recent, most\r\nreadily bring him back to me, as he would appear to those near to whom\r\nhe had grown older, scarcely changed by the eighteen years that have\r\npassed since. Timid and often awkward, I began under him my laboratory\r\neducation....\r\n\r\n\"Surrounded by apparatus for the greater part conceived or modified by\r\nhimself, he manipulated it with extreme dexterity, with the familiar\r\ngestures of the long white hands of the physicist....\r\n\r\n\"He was twenty-nine years old when I entered as a student. The mastery\r\nwhich ten years, passed entirely in the laboratory, had given him,\r\nimposed itself even on us, despite our ignorance, by the surety of his\r\nmovements and explanations, and the ease, shaded by timidity, of his\r\nmanner. We returned always with joy to the laboratory, where it was good\r\nto work near him because we felt him working near to us in that large,\r\nlight room filled with apparatus whose forms were still a little\r\nmysterious to us. We did not fear to enter it often to consult him, and\r\nhe sometimes admitted us, too, to perform some particularly delicate\r\nmanipulation. Probably my finest memories of my school years are those\r\nof moments passed there standing before the blackboard where he took\r\npleasure in talking with us, in awakening in us fruitful ideas, and in\r\ndiscussions of research which formed our taste for the things of\r\nscience. His live and contagious curiosity, the fullness and surety of\r\nhis information made him an admirable awakener of spirits.\"\r\n\r\nI have wished above all, in gathering together here these few memories,\r\nin a bouquet reverently placed upon his tomb, to help, if I can, to fix\r\nthe image of a man truly great in character and in thought, of a\r\nwonderful representative of the genius of our race. Entirely\r\nunfranchised from ancient servitudes, and passionately loving reason and\r\nclarity, he was an example--as is a prophet inspired by truths of the\r\nfuture--of what may be realized in moral beauty and goodness by a free\r\nand upright spirit, of constant courage, and of a mental honesty which\r\nmade him repulse what he did not understand, and place his life in\r\naccord with this dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: From the great number of letters and telegrams of\r\ncondolence, I quote, as examples, these lines written by three great\r\nscientists, today no longer living.\r\n\r\nFrom M.

Many of our feelings change with the years, and, when faded\r\naway, may seem altogether strange; incidents lose their momentary\r\ninterest and may be remembered as if they have occurred to some other\r\nperson. But there may be in a life some general direction, some\r\ncontinuous thread, due to a few dominant ideas and a few strong\r\nfeelings, that explain the life and are characteristic of a human\r\npersonality. Of my life, which has not been easy on the whole, I have\r\ndescribed the general course and the essential features, and I trust\r\nthat my story gives an understanding of the state of mind in which I\r\nhave lived and worked.\r\n\r\nMy family is of Polish origin, and my name is Marie Sklodowska. My\r\nfather and my mother both came from among the small Polish landed\r\nproprietors. In my country this class is composed of a large number of\r\nfamilies, owners of small and medium-sized estates, frequently\r\ninterrelated. It has been, until recently, chiefly from this group that\r\nPoland has drawn her intellectual recruits.\r\n\r\nWhile my paternal grandfather had divided his time between agriculture\r\nand directing a provincial college, my father, more strongly drawn to\r\nstudy, followed the course of the University of Petrograd, and later\r\ndefinitely established himself at Warsaw as Professor of Physics and\r\nMathematics in one of the lyceums of that city. He married a young woman\r\nwhose mode of life was congenial to his; for, although very young, she\r\nhad, what was, for that time, a very serious education, and was the\r\ndirector of one of the best Warsaw schools for young girls.\r\n\r\nMy father and mother worshiped their profession in the highest degree\r\nand have left, all over their country, a lasting remembrance with their\r\npupils. I cannot, even to-day, go into Polish society without meeting\r\npersons who have tender memories of my parents.\r\n\r\nAlthough my parents adopted a university career, they continued to keep\r\nin close touch with their numerous family in the country. It was with\r\ntheir relatives that I frequently spent my vacation, living in all\r\nfreedom and finding opportunities to know the field life by which I was\r\ndeeply attracted. To these conditions, so different from the usual\r\nvillegiature, I believe, I owe my love for the country and nature.\r\n\r\nBorn at Warsaw, on the 7th of November, 1867, I was the last of five\r\nchildren, but my oldest sister died at the early age of fourteen, and we\r\nwere left, three sisters and a brother. Cruelly struck by the loss of\r\nher daughter and worn away by a grave illness, my mother died at\r\nforty-two, leaving her husband in the deepest sorrow with his children.\r\nI was then only nine years old, and my eldest brother was hardly\r\nthirteen.\r\n\r\nThis catastrophe was the first great sorrow of my life and threw me into\r\na profound depression. My mother had an exceptional personality. With\r\nall her intellectuality she had a big heart and a very high sense of\r\nduty. And, though possessing infinite indulgence and good nature, she\r\nstill held in the family a remarkable moral authority. She had an ardent\r\npiety (my parents were both Catholics), but she was never intolerant;\r\ndifferences in religious belief did not trouble her; she was equally\r\nkind to any one not sharing her opinions. Her influence over me was\r\nextraordinary, for in me the natural love of the little girl for her\r\nmother was united with a passionate admiration.\r\n\r\nVery much affected by the death of my mother, my father devoted himself\r\nentirely to his work and to the care of our education. His professional\r\nobligations were heavy and left him little leisure time. For many years\r\nwe all felt weighing on us the loss of the one who had been the soul of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nWe all started our studies very young. I was only six years old, and,\r\nbecause I was the youngest and smallest in the class, was frequently\r\nbrought forward to recite when there were visitors. This was a great\r\ntrial to me, because of my timidity; I wanted always to run away and\r\nhide. My father, an excellent educator, was interested in our work and\r\nknew how to direct it, but the conditions of our education were\r\ndifficult. We began our studies in private schools and finished them in\r\nthose of the government.\r\n\r\nWarsaw was then under Russian domination, and one of the worst aspects\r\nof this control was the oppression exerted on the school and the child.\r\nThe private schools directed by Poles were closely watched by the police\r\nand overburdened with the necessity of teaching the Russian language\r\neven to children so young that they could scarcely speak their native\r\nPolish. Nevertheless, since the teachers were nearly all of Polish\r\nnationality, they endeavored in every possible way to mitigate the\r\ndifficulties resulting from the national persecution. These schools,\r\nhowever, could not legally give diplomas, which were obtainable only in\r\nthose of the government.\r\n\r\nThe latter, entirely Russian, were directly opposed to the Polish\r\nnational spirit. All instruction was given in Russian, by Russian\r\nprofessors, who, being hostile to the Polish nation, treated their\r\npupils as enemies. Men of moral and intellectual distinction could\r\nscarcely agree to teach in schools where an alien attitude was forced\r\nupon them. So what the pupils were taught was of questionable value, and\r\nthe moral atmosphere was altogether unbearable. Constantly held in\r\nsuspicion and spied upon, the children knew that a single conversation\r\nin Polish, or an imprudent word, might seriously harm, not only\r\nthemselves, but also their families. Amidst these hostilities, they lost\r\nall the joy of life, and precocious feelings of distrust and indignation\r\nweighed upon their childhood. On the other side, this abnormal situation\r\nresulted in exciting the patriotic feeling of Polish youths to the\r\nhighest degree.\r\n\r\nYet of this period of my early youth, darkened though it was by\r\nmourning and the sorrow of oppression, I still keep more than one\r\npleasant remembrance. In our quiet but occupied life, reunions of\r\nrelatives and friends of our family brought some joy. My father was very\r\ninterested in literature and well acquainted with Polish and foreign\r\npoetry; he even composed poetry himself and was able to translate it\r\nfrom foreign languages into Polish in a very successful way. His little\r\npoems on family events were our delight. On Saturday evenings he used to\r\nrecite or read to us the masterpieces of Polish prose and poetry. These\r\nevenings were for us a great pleasure and a source of renewed patriotic\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nSince my childhood I have had a strong taste for poetry, and I willingly\r\nlearned by heart long passages from our great poets, the favorite ones\r\nbeing Mickiewecz, Krasinski and Slowacki. This taste was even more\r\ndeveloped when I became acquainted with foreign literatures; my early\r\nstudies included the knowledge of French, German, and Russian, and I\r\nsoon became familiar with the fine works written in these languages.\r\nLater I felt the need of knowing English and succeeded in acquiring the\r\nknowledge of that language and its literature.\r\n\r\nMy musical studies have been very scarce. My mother was a musician and\r\nhad a beautiful voice. She wanted us to have musical training. After her\r\ndeath, having no more encouragement from her, I soon abandoned this\r\neffort, which I often regretted afterwards.\r\n\r\nI learned easily mathematics and physics, as far as these sciences were\r\ntaken in consideration in the school. I found in this ready help from my\r\nfather, who loved science and had to teach it himself. He enjoyed any\r\nexplanation he could give us about Nature and her ways. Unhappily, he\r\nhad no laboratory and could not perform experiments.\r\n\r\nThe periods of vacations were particularly comforting, when, escaping\r\nthe strict watch of the police in the city, we took refuge with\r\nrelatives or friends in the country. There we found the free life of the\r\nold-fashioned family estate; races in the woods and joyous participation\r\nin work in the far-stretching, level grain-fields. At other times we\r\npassed the border of our Russian-ruled division (Congress Poland) and\r\nwent southwards into the mountain country of Galicia, where the Austrian\r\npolitical control was less oppressive than that which we suffered. There\r\nwe could speak Polish in all freedom and sing patriotic songs without\r\ngoing to prison.\r\n\r\nMy first impression of the mountains was very vivid, because I had been\r\nbrought up in the plains. So I enjoyed immensely our life in the\r\nCarpathian villages, the view of the pikes, the excursions to the\r\nvalleys and to the high mountain lakes with picturesque names such as:\r\n\"The Eye of the Sea.\" However, I never lost my attachment to the open\r\nhorizon and the gentle views of a plain hill country.\r\n\r\nLater I had the opportunity to spend a vacation with my father far more\r\nsouth in Podolia, and to have the first view of the sea at Odessa, and\r\nafterwards at the Baltic shore. This was a thrilling experience. But it\r\nwas in France that I become acquainted with the big waves of the ocean\r\nand the ever-changing tide. All my life through, the new sights of\r\nNature made me rejoice like a child.\r\n\r\nThus passed the period of our school life. We all had much facility for\r\nintellectual work. My brother, Doctor Sklodowski, having finished his\r\nmedical studies, became later the chief physician in one of the\r\nprincipal Warsaw hospitals. My sisters and I intended to take up\r\nteaching as our parents had done. However, my elder sister, when grown\r\nup, changed her mind and decided to study medicine. She took the degree\r\nof doctor at the Paris University, married Doctor Dluski, a Polish\r\nphysician, and together they established an important sanatorium in a\r\nwonderfully beautiful Carpathian mountain place of Austrian Poland. My\r\nsecond sister, married in Warsaw, Mrs. Szalay, was for many years a\r\nteacher in the schools, where she rendered great service. Later she was\r\nappointed in one of the lyceums of free Poland.\r\n\r\nI was but fifteen when I finished my high-school studies, always having\r\nheld first rank in my class. The fatigue of growth and study compelled\r\nme to take almost a year's rest in the country. I then returned to my\r\nfather in Warsaw, hoping to teach in the free schools. But family\r\ncircumstances obliged me to change my decision. My father, now aged and\r\ntired, needed rest; his fortune was very modest. So I resolved to accept\r\na position as governess for several children. Thus, when scarcely\r\nseventeen, I left my father's house to begin an independent life.\r\n\r\nThat going away remains one of the most vivid memories of my youth. My\r\nheart was heavy as I climbed into the railway car. It was to carry me\r\nfor several hours, away from those I loved. And after the railway\r\njourney I must drive for five hours longer. What experience was awaiting\r\nme? So I questioned as I sat close to the car window looking out across\r\nthe wide plains.\r\n\r\nThe father of the family to which I went was an agriculturist. His\r\noldest daughter was about my age, and although working with me, was my\r\ncompanion rather than my pupil. There were two younger children, a boy\r\nand a girl. My relations with my pupils were friendly; after our lessons\r\nwe went together for daily walks. Loving the country, I did not feel\r\nlonesome, and although this particular country was not especially\r\npicturesque, I was satisfied with it in all seasons. I took the greatest\r\ninterest in the agricultural development of the estate where the methods\r\nwere considered as models for the region. I knew the progressive details\r\nof the work, the distribution of crops in the fields; I eagerly followed\r\nthe growth of the plants, and in the stables of the farm I knew the\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nIn winter the vast plains, covered with snow, were not lacking in charm,\r\nand we went for long sleigh rides. Sometimes we could hardly see the\r\nroad. \"Look out for the ditch!\" I would call to the driver. \"You are\r\ngoing straight into it,\" and \"Never fear!\" he would answer, as over we\r\nwent! But these tumbles only added to the gayety of our excursions.\r\n\r\nI remember the marvelous snow house we made one winter when the snow was\r\nvery high in the fields; we could sit in it and look out across the\r\nrose-tinted snow plains. We also used to skate on the ice of the river\r\nand to watch the weather anxiously, to make sure that the ice was not\r\ngoing to give way, depriving us of our pleasure.\r\n\r\nSince my duties with my pupils did not take up all my time, I organized\r\na small class for the children of the village who could not be educated\r\nunder the Russian government. In this the oldest daughter of the house\r\naided me. We taught the little children and the girls who wished to come\r\nhow to read and write, and we put in circulation Polish books which were\r\nappreciated, too, by the parents. Even this innocent work presented\r\ndanger, as all initiative of this kind was forbidden by the government\r\nand might bring imprisonment or deportation to Siberia.\r\n\r\nMy evenings I generally devoted to study. I had heard that a few women\r\nhad succeeded in following certain courses in Petrograd or in foreign\r\ncountries, and I was determined to prepare myself by preliminary work to\r\nfollow their example.\r\n\r\nI had not yet decided what path I would choose. I was as much interested\r\nin literature and sociology as in science. However, during these years\r\nof isolated work, trying little by little to find my real preferences, I\r\nfinally turned towards mathematics and physics, and resolutely undertook\r\na serious preparation for future work. This work I proposed doing in\r\nParis, and I hoped to save enough money to be able to live and work in\r\nthat city for some time.\r\n\r\nMy solitary study was beset with difficulties. The scientific education\r\nI had received at the lyceum was very incomplete; it was well under the\r\nbachelorship program of a French lyceum; I tried to add to it in my own\r\nway, with the help of books picked up at random. This method could not\r\nbe greatly productive, yet it was not without results. I acquired the\r\nhabit of independent work, and learned a few things which were to be of\r\nuse later on.\r\n\r\nI had to modify my plans for the future when my eldest sister decided to\r\ngo to Paris to study medicine. We had promised each other mutual aid,\r\nbut our means did not permit of our leaving together. So I kept my\r\nposition for three and a half years, and, having finished my work with\r\nmy pupils, I returned to Warsaw, where a position, similar to the one I\r\nhad left, was awaiting me.\r\n\r\nI kept this new place for only a year and then went back to my father,\r\nwho had retired some time before and was living alone. Together we\r\npassed an excellent year, he occupying himself with some literary work,\r\nwhile I increased our funds by giving private lessons. Meantime I\r\ncontinued my efforts to educate myself. This was no easy task under the\r\nRussian government of Warsaw; yet I found more opportunities than in the\r\ncountry. To my great joy, I was able, for the first time in my life, to\r\nfind access to a laboratory: a small municipal physical laboratory\r\ndirected by one of my cousins. I found little time to work there, except\r\nin the evenings and on Sundays, and was generally left to myself. I\r\ntried out various experiments described in treatises on physics and\r\nchemistry, and the results were sometimes unexpected. At times I would\r\nbe encouraged by a little unhoped-for success, at others I would be in\r\nthe deepest despair because of accidents and failures resulting from my\r\ninexperience. But on the whole, though I was taught that the way of\r\nprogress is neither swift nor easy, this first trial confirmed in me the\r\ntaste for experimental research in the fields of physics and chemistry.\r\n\r\nOther means of instruction came to me through my being one of an\r\nenthusiastic group of young men and women of Warsaw, who united in a\r\ncommon desire to study, and whose activities were at the same time\r\nsocial and patriotic. It was one of those groups of Polish youths who\r\nbelieved that the hope of their country lay in a great effort to develop\r\nthe intellectual and moral strength of the nation, and that such an\r\neffort would lead to a better national situation. The nearest purpose\r\nwas to work at one's own instruction and to provide means of instruction\r\nfor workmen and peasants. In accordance with this program we agreed\r\namong ourselves to give evening courses, each one teaching what he knew\r\nbest. There is no need to say that this was a secret organization, which\r\nmade everything extremely difficult. There were in our group very\r\ndevoted young people who, as I still believe today, could do truly\r\nuseful work.\r\n\r\nI have a bright remembrance of the sympathetic intellectual and social\r\ncompanionship which I enjoyed at that time. Truly the means of action\r\nwere poor and the results obtained could not be considerable; yet I\r\nstill believe that the ideas which inspired us then are the only way to\r\nreal social progress. You cannot hope to build a better world without\r\nimproving the individuals. To that end each of us must work for his own\r\nimprovement, and at the same time share a general responsibility for all\r\nhumanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can\r\nbe most useful.\r\n\r\nAll the experiences of this period intensified my longing for further\r\nstudy. And, in his affection for me, my father, in spite of limited\r\nresources, helped me to hasten the execution of my early project. My\r\nsister had just married at Paris, and it was decided that I should go\r\nthere to live with her. My father and I hoped that, once my studies were\r\nfinished, we would again live happily together. Fate was to decide\r\notherwise, since my marriage was to hold me in France. My father, who in\r\nhis own youth had wished to do scientific work, was consoled in our\r\nseparation by the progressive success of my work. I keep a tender memory\r\nof his kindness and disinterestedness. He lived with the family of my\r\nmarried brother, and, like an excellent grandfather, brought up the\r\nchildren. We had the sorrow of losing him in 1902, when he had just\r\npassed seventy.\r\n\r\nSo it was in November, 1891, at the age of twenty-four, that I was able\r\nto realize the dream that had been always present in my mind for several\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in Paris I was affectionately welcomed by my sister and\r\nbrother-in-law, but I stayed with them only for a few months, for they\r\nlived in one of the outside quarters of Paris where my brother-in-law\r\nwas beginning a medical practice, and I needed to get nearer to the\r\nschools. I was finally installed, like many other students of my\r\ncountry, in a modest little room for which I gathered some furniture. I\r\nkept to this way of living during the four years of my student life.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to tell of all the good these years brought to\r\nme. Undistracted by any outside occupation, I was entirely absorbed in\r\nthe joy of learning and understanding. Yet, all the while, my living\r\nconditions were far from easy, my own funds being small and my family\r\nnot having the means to aid me as they would have liked to do. However,\r\nmy situation was not exceptional; it was the familiar experience of many\r\nof the Polish students whom I knew. The room I lived in was in a garret,\r\nvery cold in winter, for it was insufficiently heated by a small stove\r\nwhich often lacked coal. During a particularly rigorous winter, it was\r\nnot unusual for the water to freeze in the basin in the night; to be\r\nable to sleep I was obliged to pile all my clothes on the bedcovers. In\r\nthe same room I prepared my meals with the aid of an alcohol lamp and a\r\nfew kitchen utensils. These meals were often reduced to bread with a cup\r\nof chocolate, eggs or fruit. I had no help in housekeeping and I myself\r\ncarried the little coal I used up the six flights.\r\n\r\nThis life, painful from certain points of view, had, for all that, a\r\nreal charm for me. It gave me a very precious sense of liberty and\r\nindependence. Unknown in Paris, I was lost in the great city, but the\r\nfeeling of living there alone, taking care of myself without any aid,\r\ndid not at all depress me. If sometimes I felt lonesome, my usual state\r\nof mind was one of calm and great moral satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAll my mind was centered on my studies, which, especially at the\r\nbeginning, were difficult. In fact, I was insufficiently prepared to\r\nfollow the physical science course at the Sorbonne, for, despite all my\r\nefforts, I had not succeeded in acquiring in Poland a preparation as\r\ncomplete as that of the French students following the same course. So I\r\nwas obliged to supply this deficiency, especially in mathematics. I\r\ndivided my time between courses, experimental work, and study in the\r\nlibrary. In the evening I worked in my room, sometimes very late into\r\nthe night. All that I saw and learned that was new delighted me. It was\r\nlike a new world opened to me, the world of science, which I was at last\r\npermitted to know in all liberty.\r\n\r\nI have pleasant memories of my relations with my student companions.\r\nReserved and shy at the beginning, it was not long before I noticed that\r\nthe students, nearly all of whom worked seriously, were disposed to be\r\nfriendly. Our conversations about our studies deepened our interest in\r\nthe problems we discussed.\r\n\r\nAmong the Polish students I did not have any companions in my studies.\r\nNevertheless, my relations with their small colony had a certain\r\nintimacy. From time to time we would gather in one another's bare rooms,\r\nwhere we could talk over national questions and feel less isolated. We\r\nwould also go for walks together, or attend public reunions, for we were\r\nall interested in politics. By the end of the first year, however, I was\r\nforced to give up these relationships, for I found that all my energy\r\nhad to be concentrated on my studies, in order to achieve them as soon\r\nas possible. I was even obliged to devote most of my vacation time to\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\nMy persistent efforts were not in vain. I was able to make up for the\r\ndeficiency of my training and to pass examinations at the same time with\r\nthe other students. I even had the satisfaction of graduating in first\r\nrank as \"_licenciée es sciences physiques_\" in 1893, and in second rank\r\nas \"_licenciée es sciences mathématiques_\" in 1894.\r\n\r\nMy brother-in-law, recalling later these years of work under the\r\nconditions I have just described, jokingly referred to them as \"the\r\nheroic period of my sister-in-law's life.\" For myself, I shall always\r\nconsider one of the best memories of my life that period of solitary\r\nyears exclusively devoted to the studies, finally within my reach, for\r\nwhich I had waited so long.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1894 that I first met Pierre Curie. One of my compatriots, a\r\nprofessor at the University of Fribourg, having called upon me, invited\r\nme to his home, with a young physicist of Paris, whom he knew and\r\nesteemed highly. Upon entering the room I perceived, standing framed by\r\nthe French window opening on the balcony, a tall young man with auburn\r\nhair and large, limpid eyes. I noticed the grave and gentle expression\r\nof his face, as well as a certain abandon in his attitude, suggesting\r\nthe dreamer absorbed in his reflections. He showed me a simple\r\ncordiality and seemed to me very sympathetic. After that first interview\r\nhe expressed the desire to see me again and to continue our conversation\r\nof that evening on scientific and social subjects in which he and I were\r\nboth interested, and on which we seemed to have similar opinions.\r\n\r\nSome time later, he came to me in my student room and we became good\r\nfriends. He described to me his days, filled with work, and his dream of\r\nan existence entirely devoted to science. He was not long in asking me\r\nto share that existence, but I could not decide at once; I hesitated\r\nbefore a decision that meant abandoning my country and my family.\r\n\r\nI went back to Poland for my vacation, without knowing whether or not I\r\nwas to return to Paris. But circumstances permitted me again to take up\r\nmy work there in the autumn of that year. I entered one of the physics\r\nlaboratories at the Sorbonne, to begin experimental research in\r\npreparation for my doctor's thesis.\r\n\r\nAgain I saw Pierre Curie. Our work drew us closer and closer, until we\r\nwere both convinced that neither of us could find a better life\r\ncompanion. So our marriage was decided upon and took place a little\r\nlater, in July, 1895.\r\n\r\nPierre Curie had just received his doctor's degree and had been made\r\nprofessor in the School of Physics and Chemistry of the City of Paris.\r\nHe was thirty-six years old, and already a physicist known and\r\nappreciated in France and abroad. Solely preoccupied with scientific\r\ninvestigation, he had paid little attention to his career, and his\r\nmaterial resources were very modest. He lived at Sceaux, in the suburbs\r\nof Paris, with his old parents, whom he loved tenderly, and whom he\r\ndescribed as \"exquisite\" the first time he spoke to me about them. In\r\nfact, they were so: the father was an elderly physician of high\r\nintellect and strong character, and the mother the most excellent of\r\nwomen, entirely devoted to her husband and her sons. Pierre's elder\r\nbrother, who was then professor at the University of Montpellier, was\r\nalways his best friend. So I had the privilege of entering into a family\r\nworthy of affection and esteem, and where I found the warmest welcome.\r\n\r\nWe were married in the simplest way. I wore no unusual dress on my\r\nmarriage day, and only a few friends were present at the ceremony, but\r\nI had the joy of having my father and my second sister come from Poland.\r\n\r\nWe did not care for more than a quiet place in which to live and to\r\nwork, and were happy to find a little apartment of three rooms with a\r\nbeautiful view of a garden. A few pieces of furniture came to us from\r\nour parents. With a money gift from a relative we acquired two bicycles\r\nto take us out into the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nWith my marriage there began for me a new existence entirely different\r\nfrom the solitary life that I had known during the preceding years. My\r\nhusband and I were so closely united by our affection and our common\r\nwork that we passed nearly all of our time together. I have only a few\r\nletters from him, for we were so little apart. My husband spent all the\r\ntime he could spare from his teaching at his research work in the\r\nlaboratory of the school in which he was professor and I obtained\r\nauthorization to work with him.\r\n\r\nOur living apartment was near the school, so we lost little time in\r\ngoing and coming. As our material resources were limited, I was obliged\r\nto attend to most of the housekeeping myself, particularly the\r\npreparation of meals. It was not easy to reconcile these household\r\nduties with my scientific work, yet, with good will, I managed it. The\r\ngreat thing was that we were alone together in the little home which\r\ngave us a peace and intimacy that were very enjoyable for us.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that I was working in the laboratory, I still had to\r\ntake a few study courses, for I had decided to take part in the\r\nexamination for a certificate that would allow me to teach young girls.\r\nIf I succeeded in this, I would be entitled to be named professor. In\r\nAugust, 1896, after having devoted several months to preparation, I came\r\nout first in the examination.\r\n\r\nOur principal distraction from the close work of the laboratory\r\nconsisted in walks or bicycle rides in the country. My husband greatly\r\nenjoyed the out-of-doors and took great interest in the plants and\r\nanimals of woods and meadows. Hardly a corner in the vicinity of Paris\r\nwas unknown to him. I also loved the country and these excursions were a\r\ngreat joy for me as well as to him, relieving our mind from the tension\r\nof the scientific work. We used to bring home bunches of flowers.\r\nSometimes we forgot all about the time and got back late at night. We\r\nvisited regularly my husband's parents where our room was always ready.\r\n\r\nIn the vacation we went on longer outings by means of our bicycles. In\r\nthis way we covered much ground in Auvergne and in the Cevennes and\r\nvisited several regions at the seashore. We took a great delight in\r\nthese long all-day excursions, arriving at night always in a new place.\r\nIf we stayed in one place too long, my husband began to wish to get back\r\nto the laboratory. It is also in vacation time that we visited once my\r\nfamily in the Carpathian mountains. My husband learned some Polish in\r\nview of this journey to Poland.\r\n\r\nBut first of all in our life was our scientific work. My husband gave\r\nmuch care to the preparation of his courses, and I gave him some\r\nassistance in this, which, at the time, helped me in my education.\r\nHowever, most of our time was devoted to our laboratory researches.\r\n\r\nMy husband did not then have a private laboratory. He could, to some\r\nextent, use the laboratory of the school for his own work, but found\r\nmore freedom by installing himself in some unused corner of the Physics\r\nSchool building. I thus learned from his example that one could work\r\nhappily even in very insufficient quarters. At this time my husband was\r\noccupied with researches on crystals, while I undertook an investigation\r\nof the magnetic properties of steel. This work was completed and\r\npublished in 1897.\r\n\r\nIn that same year the birth of our first daughter brought a great change\r\nin our life. A few weeks later my husband's mother died and his father\r\ncame to live with us. We took a small house with a garden at the border\r\nof Paris and continued to occupy this house as long as my husband lived.\r\n\r\nIt became a serious problem how to take care of our little Irene and of\r\nour home without giving up my scientific work. Such a renunciation would\r\nhave been very painful to me, and my husband would not even think of it;\r\nhe used to say that he had got a wife made expressly for him to share\r\nall his preoccupations. Neither of us would contemplate abandoning what\r\nwas so precious to both.\r\n\r\nOf course we had to have a servant, but I personally saw to all the\r\ndetails of the child's care. While I was in the laboratory, she was in\r\nthe care of her grandfather, who loved her tenderly and whose own life\r\nwas made brighter by her. So the close union of our family enabled me to\r\nmeet my obligations. Things were particularly difficult only in case of\r\nmore exceptional events, such as a child's illness, when sleepless\r\nnights interrupted the normal course of life.\r\n\r\nIt can be easily understood that there was no place in our life for\r\nworldly relations. We saw but a few friends, scientific workers, like\r\nourselves, with whom we talked in our home or in our garden, while I did\r\nsome sewing for my little girl. We also maintained affectionate\r\nrelations with my husband's brother and his family. But I was separated\r\nfrom all my relatives, as my sister had left Paris with her husband to\r\nlive in Poland.\r\n\r\nIt was under this mode of quiet living, organized according to our\r\ndesires, that we achieved the great work of our lives, work begun about\r\nthe end of 1897 and lasting for many years.\r\n\r\nI had decided on a theme for my doctorate. My attention had been drawn\r\nto the interesting experiments of Henri Becquerel on the salts of the\r\nrare metal uranium. Becquerel had shown that by placing some uranium\r\nsalt on a photographic plate, covered with black paper, the plate would\r\nbe affected as if light had fallen on it. The effect is produced by\r\nspecial rays which are emitted by the uranium salt and are different\r\nfrom ordinary luminous rays as they can pass through black paper.\r\nBecquerel also showed that these rays can discharge an electroscope. He\r\nat first thought that the uranium rays were produced as a result of\r\nexposing the uranium salt to light, but experiment showed that salts\r\nkept for several months in the dark continued the peculiar rays.\r\n\r\nMy husband and I were much excited by this new phenomenon, and I\r\nresolved to undertake the special study of it. It seemed to me that the\r\nfirst thing to do was to measure the phenomenon with precision. In this\r\nI decided to use that property of the rays which enabled them to\r\ndischarge an electroscope. However, instead of the usual electroscope, I\r\nused a more perfect apparatus. One of the models of the apparatus used\r\nby me for these first measurements is now in the College of Physicians\r\nand Surgeons in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nI was not long in obtaining interesting results. My determinations\r\nshowed that the emission of the rays is an atomic property of the\r\nuranium, whatever the physical or chemical conditions of the salt were.\r\nAny substance containing uranium is as much more active in emitting\r\nrays, as it contains more of this element.\r\n\r\nI then thought to find out if there were other substances possessing\r\nthis remarkable property of uranium, and soon found that substances\r\ncontaining thorium behaved in a similar way, and that this behavior\r\ndepended similarly on an atomic property of thorium. I was now about to\r\nundertake a detailed study of the uranium and thorium rays when I\r\ndiscovered a new interesting fact.\r\n\r\nI had occasion to examine a certain number of minerals. A few of them\r\nshowed activity; they were those containing either uranium or thorium.\r\nThe activity of these minerals would have had nothing astonishing about\r\nit, if it had been in proportion to the quantities of uranium or thorium\r\ncontained in them. But it was not so. Some of these minerals revealed an\r\nactivity three or four times greater than that of uranium. I verified\r\nthis surprising fact carefully, and could not doubt its truth.\r\nSpeculating about the reason for this, there seemed to be but one\r\nexplanation. There must be, I thought, some unknown substance, very\r\nactive, in these minerals. My husband agreed with me and I urged that we\r\nsearch at once for this hypothetical substance, thinking that, with\r\njoined efforts, a result would be quickly obtained. Neither of us could\r\nforesee that in beginning this work we were to enter the path of a new\r\nscience which we should follow for all our future.\r\n\r\nOf course, I did not expect, even at the beginning, to find a new\r\nelement in any large quantity, as the minerals had already been analyzed\r\nwith some precision. At least, I thought there might be as much as one\r\nper cent of the unknown substance in the minerals. But the more we\r\nworked, the clearer we realized that the new radioactive element could\r\nexist only in quite minute proportion and that, in consequence, its\r\nactivity must be very great. Would we have insisted, despite the\r\nscarcity of our means of research, if we had known the true proportion\r\nof what we were searching for, no one can tell; all that can be said now\r\nis that the constant progress of our work held us absorbed in a\r\npassionate research, while the difficulties were ever increasing. As a\r\nmatter of fact, it was only after several years of most arduous labor\r\nthat we finally succeeded in completely separating the new substance,\r\nnow known to everybody as radium. Here is, briefly, the story of the\r\nsearch and discovery.\r\n\r\nAs we did not know, at the beginning, any of the chemical properties of\r\nthe unknown substance, but only that it emits rays, it was by these rays\r\nthat we had to search. We first undertook the analysis of a pitchblende\r\nfrom St. Joachimsthal. Analyzing this ore by the usual chemical methods,\r\nwe added an examination of its different parts for radioactivity, by the\r\nuse of our delicate electrical apparatus. This was the foundation of a\r\nnew method of chemical analysis which, following our work, has been\r\nextended, with the result that a large number of radioactive elements\r\nhave been discovered.\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks we could be convinced that our prevision had been right,\r\nfor the activity was concentrating in a regular way. And, in a few\r\nmonths, we could separate from the pitchblende a substance accompanying\r\nthe bismuth, much more active than uranium, and having well defined\r\nchemical properties. In July, 1898, we announced the existence of this\r\nnew substance, to which I gave the name of polonium, in memory of my\r\nnative country.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in this work on polonium, we had also discovered that,\r\naccompanying the barium separated from the pitchblende, there was\r\nanother new element. After several months more of close work we were\r\nable to separate this second new substance, which was afterwards shown\r\nto be much more important than polonium. In December, 1898, we could\r\nannounce the discovery of this new and now famous element, to which we\r\ngave the name of radium.\r\n\r\nHowever, the greatest part of the material work had yet to be done. We\r\nhad, to be sure, discovered the existence of the remarkable new\r\nelements, but it was chiefly by their radiant properties that these new\r\nsubstances were distinguished from the bismuth and barium with which\r\nthey were mixed in minute quantities. We had still to separate them as\r\npure elements. On this work we now started.\r\n\r\nWe were very poorly equipped with facilities for this purpose. It was\r\nnecessary to subject large quantities of ore to careful chemical\r\ntreatment. We had no money, no suitable laboratory, no personal help for\r\nour great and difficult undertaking. It was like creating something out\r\nof nothing, and if my earlier studying years had once been called by my\r\nbrother-in-law the heroic period of my life, I can say without\r\nexaggeration that the period on which my husband and I now entered was\r\ntruly the heroic one of our common life.\r\n\r\nWe knew by our experiments that in the treatment of pitchblende at the\r\nuranium plant of St. Joachimsthal, radium must have been left in the\r\nresidues, and, with the permission of the Austrian government, which\r\nowned the plant, we succeeded in securing a certain quantity of these\r\nresidues, then quite valueless,--and used them for extraction of radium.\r\nHow glad I was when the sacks arrived, with the brown dust mixed with\r\npine needles, and when the activity proved even greater than that of the\r\nprimitive ore! It was a stroke of luck that the residues had not been\r\nthrown far away or disposed of in some way, but left in a heap in the\r\npine wood near the plant. Some time later, the Austrian government, on\r\nthe proposition of the Academy of Science of Vienna, let us have several\r\ntons of similar residues at a low price. With this material was prepared\r\nall the radium I had in my laboratory up to the date when I received the\r\nprecious gift from the American women.\r\n\r\nThe School of Physics could give us no suitable premises, but for lack\r\nof anything better, the Director permitted us to use an abandoned shed\r\nwhich had been in service as a dissecting room of the School of\r\nMedicine. Its glass roof did not afford complete shelter against rain;\r\nthe heat was suffocating in summer, and the bitter cold of winter was\r\nonly a little lessened by the iron stove, except in its immediate\r\nvicinity. There was no question of obtaining the needed proper apparatus\r\nin common use by chemists. We simply had some old pine-wood tables with\r\nfurnaces and gas burners. We had to use the adjoining yard for those of\r\nour chemical operations that involved producing irritating gases; even\r\nthen the gas often filled our shed. With this equipment we entered on\r\nour exhausting work.\r\n\r\nYet it was in this miserable old shed that we passed the best and\r\nhappiest years of our life, devoting our entire days to our work. Often\r\nI had to prepare our lunch in the shed, so as not to interrupt some\r\nparticularly important operation. Sometimes I had to spend a whole day\r\nmixing a boiling mass with a heavy iron rod nearly as large as myself. I\r\nwould be broken with fatigue at the day's end. Other days, on the\r\ncontrary, the work would be a most minute and delicate fractional\r\ncrystallization, in the effort to concentrate the radium. I was then\r\nannoyed by the floating dust of iron and coal from which I could not\r\nprotect my precious products. But I shall never be able to express the\r\njoy of the untroubled quietness of this atmosphere of research and the\r\nexcitement of actual progress with the confident hope of still better\r\nresults. The feeling of discouragement that sometimes came after some\r\nunsuccessful toil did not last long and gave way to renewed activity. We\r\nhad happy moments devoted to a quiet discussion of our work, walking\r\naround our shed.\r\n\r\nOne of our joys was to go into our workroom at night; we then perceived\r\non all sides the feebly luminous silhouettes of the bottles or capsules\r\ncontaining our products. It was really a lovely sight and one always new\r\nto us. The glowing tubes looked like faint, fairy lights.\r\n\r\nThus the months passed, and our efforts, hardly interrupted by short\r\nvacations, brought forth more and more complete evidence. Our faith grew\r\never stronger, and our work being more and more known, we found means to\r\nget new quantities of raw material and to carry on some of our crude\r\nprocesses in a factory, allowing me to give more time to the delicate\r\nfinishing treatment.\r\n\r\nAt this stage I devoted myself especially to the purification of the\r\nradium, my husband being absorbed by the study of the physical\r\nproperties of the rays emitted by the new substances. It was only after\r\ntreating one ton of pitchblende residues that I could get definite\r\nresults. Indeed we know to-day that even in the best minerals there are\r\nnot more than a few decigrammes of radium in a ton of raw material.\r\n\r\nAt last the time came when the isolated substances showed all the\r\ncharacters of a pure chemical body. This body, the radium, gives a\r\ncharacteristic spectrum, and I was able to determine for it an atomic\r\nweight much higher than that of the barium. This was achieved in 1902. I\r\nthen possessed one decigramme of very pure radium chloride. It had taken\r\nme almost four years to produce the kind of evidence which chemical\r\nscience demands, that radium is truly a new element. One year would\r\nprobably have been enough for the same purpose, if reasonable means had\r\nbeen at my disposal. The demonstration that cost so much effort was the\r\nbasis of the new science of radioactivity.\r\n\r\nIn later years I was able to prepare several decigrammes of pure radium\r\nsalt, to make a more accurate determination of the atomic weight and\r\neven to isolate the pure radium metal. However, 1902 was the year in\r\nwhich the existence and character of radium were definitely established.\r\n\r\nWe had been able to live for several years entirely engrossed in the\r\nwork of research, but gradually circumstances changed. In 1900 my\r\nhusband was offered a professorship in the University of Geneva, but\r\nalmost simultaneously he obtained a position of assistant professor at\r\nthe Sorbonne, and I was made professor at the Normal Superior School for\r\nyoung girls at Sèvres. So we remained in Paris.\r\n\r\nI became much interested in my work in the Normal School, and endeavored\r\nto develop more fully the practical laboratory exercises of the pupils.\r\nThese pupils were girls of about twenty years who had entered the school\r\nafter severe examination and had still to work very seriously to meet\r\nthe requirements that would enable them to be named professors in the\r\nlycées. All these young women worked with great eagerness, and it was a\r\npleasure for me to direct their studies in physics.\r\n\r\nBut a growing notoriety, because of the announcement of our discoveries,\r\nbegan to trouble our quiet work in the laboratory, and, little by\r\nlittle, life became more difficult. In 1903 I finished my doctor's\r\nthesis and obtained the degree. At the end of the same year the Nobel\r\nprize was awarded jointly to Becquerel, my husband and me for the\r\ndiscovery of radioactivity and new radioactive elements.\r\n\r\nThis event greatly increased the publicity of our work. For some time\r\nthere was no more peace. Visitors and demands for lectures and articles\r\ninterrupted every day.\r\n\r\nThe award of the Nobel prize was a great honor. It is also known that\r\nthe material means provided by this prize was much greater than is usual\r\nin prizes for science. This was a great help in the continuation of our\r\nresearches. Unhappily, we were overtired and had a succession of\r\nfailures of health for the one or the other of us, so that it was not\r\nuntil 1905 that we were able to go to Stockholm, where my husband gave\r\nhis Nobel lecture and where we were well received.\r\n\r\nThe fatigue resulting from the effort exceeding our forces, imposed by\r\nthe unsatisfactory conditions of our labor, was augmented by the\r\ninvasion of publicity. The overturn of our voluntary isolation was a\r\ncause of real suffering for us and had all the effect of disaster. It\r\nwas serious trouble brought into the organization of our life, and I\r\nhave already explained how indispensable was our freedom from external\r\ndistraction, in order to maintain our family life and our scientific\r\nactivity. Of course, people who contribute to that kind of trouble\r\ngenerally mean it kindly. It is only that they do not realize the\r\nconditions of the problem.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 our second daughter. Eve Denise, came to us. I had, of course,\r\nto interrupt my work in the laboratory for a while. In the same year,\r\nbecause of the awarding of the Nobel prize and the general public\r\nrecognition, a new chair of physics was created in Sorbonne, and my\r\nhusband was named as its occupant. At the same time I was named chief of\r\nwork in the laboratory that was to be created for him. But in reality\r\nthe laboratory was not constructed then, and only a few rooms taken from\r\nother uses were available to us.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 just as we were definitely giving up the old shed laboratory\r\nwhere we had been so happy, there came the dreadful catastrophe which\r\ntook my husband away from me and left me alone to bring up our children\r\nand, at the same time, to continue our work of research.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to express the profoundness and importance of\r\nthe crisis brought into my life by the loss of the one who had been my\r\nclosest companion and best friend. Crushed by the blow, I did not feel\r\nable to face the future. I could not forget, however, what my husband\r\nused sometimes to say, that, even deprived of him, I ought to continue\r\nmy work.\r\n\r\nThe death of my husband, coming immediately after the general knowledge\r\nof the discoveries with which his name is associated, was felt by the\r\npublic, and especially by the scientific circles, to be a national\r\nmisfortune. It was largely under the influence of this emotion that the\r\nFaculty of Sciences of Paris decided to offer me the chair, as\r\nprofessor, which my husband had occupied only one year and a half in the\r\nSorbonne. It was an exceptional decision, as up to then no woman had\r\nheld such a position. The University by doing this offered me a precious\r\nmark of esteem and gave me opportunity to pursue the researches which\r\notherwise might have had to be abandoned. I had not expected a gift of\r\nthis kind; I never had any other ambition than to be able to work freely\r\nfor science. The honor that now came to me was deeply painful under the\r\ncruel circumstances of its coming. Besides I wondered whether I would be\r\nable to face such a grave responsibility. After much hesitation, I\r\ndecided that I ought at least to try to meet the task, and so I began in\r\n1906 my teaching in the Sorbonne, as assistant professor, and two years\r\nlater I was named titular professor.\r\n\r\nIn my new situation the difficulties of my life were considerably\r\naugmented, as I alone had now to carry the burden formerly weighing on\r\nmy husband and me together. The cares of my young children required\r\nclose vigilance; in this, my husband's father, who continued to live\r\nwith us, willingly took his share. He was happy to be occupied with the\r\nlittle girls, whose company was his chief consolation after his son's\r\ndeath. By his effort and mine, the children had a bright home, even if\r\nwe lived with our inner grief, which they were too young to realize. The\r\nstrong desire of my father-in-law being to live in the country, we took\r\na house with a garden in Sceaux, a suburb of Paris, from which I could\r\nreach the city in half an hour.\r\n\r\nThis country life had great advantages, not only for my father-in-law,\r\nwho enjoyed his new surroundings, and especially his garden, but also\r\nfor my girls, who had the benefit of walks in the open country. But they\r\nwere more separated from me, and it became necessary to have a governess\r\nfor them. This position was filled first by one of my cousins, and then\r\nby a devoted woman who had already brought up the daughter of one of my\r\nsisters. Both of them were Polish, and in this way my daughters learned\r\nmy native tongue. From time to time, some one of my Polish family came\r\nto see me in my grief, and we managed to meet in vacation time, at the\r\nseashore in France, and once in the mountains of Poland.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 we suffered the loss of my very dear father-in-law, after a long\r\nillness, which brought me many sorrowful days. I used to spend at his\r\nbedside as much time as I could, listening to his remembrances of passed\r\nyears. His death affected deeply my elder daughter, who, at twelve, knew\r\nthe value of the cheerful hours spent in his company.\r\n\r\nThere were few resources for the education of my daughters in Sceaux.\r\nThe youngest one, a small child, needed principally a hygienic life,\r\noutdoor walks and quite elementary schooling. She had already shown a\r\nvivid intelligence and an unusual disposition for music. Her elder\r\nsister resembled her father in the form of her intelligence. She was not\r\nquick, but one could already see that she had a gift of reasoning power\r\nand that she would like science. She had some training in a private\r\nschool in Paris, but I had not wanted to keep her in a lycée, as I have\r\nalways found the class hours in these schools too long for the health of\r\nthe children.\r\n\r\nMy view is that in the education of children the requirement of their\r\ngrowth and physical evolution should be respected, and that some time\r\nshould be left for their artistic culture. In most schools, as they\r\nexist to-day, the time spent in various reading and writing exercises is\r\ntoo great, and the study required to be done at home too much. I also\r\nfind these schools lacking, in general, in practical exercises to\r\naccompany the scientific studies.\r\n\r\nWith a few friends in the university circle who shared these views, we\r\norganized, therefore, a cooperative group for the education of our\r\nchildren, each of us taking charge of the teaching of a particular\r\nsubject to all of the young people. We were all very busy with other\r\nthings, and the children varied in age. Nevertheless, the little\r\nexperiment thus made was very interesting. With a small number of\r\nclasses we yet succeeded in reuniting the scientific and literary\r\nelements of a desirable culture. The courses in science were accompanied\r\nby practical exercises in which the children took great interest.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement, which lasted two years, proved to be very beneficial\r\nfor most of the children; it was certainly so for my elder daughter.\r\nFollowing this preparation, she was able to enter a higher class in one\r\nof the _collèges_ of Paris, and had no difficulty in passing her\r\nbachelor's examination before the usual age, after which she continued\r\nher scientific studies in the Sorbonne.\r\n\r\nMy second daughter, although not benefiting by a similar arrangement for\r\nher earlier studies, at first followed the classes of a _collège_ only\r\npartially, and later completely. She showed herself a good pupil, doing\r\nsatisfactory work in all directions.\r\n\r\nI wanted very much to assure for my children a rational physical\r\neducation. Next to outdoor walks, I attach a great importance to\r\ngymnastics and sports. This side of a girl's education is still rather\r\nneglected in France. I took care that my children did gymnastics\r\nregularly. I was also careful to have them spend vacations either in the\r\nmountains or at the seashore. They can canoe and swim very well and are\r\nnot afraid of a long walk or a bicycle ride.\r\n\r\nBut of course the care of my children's education was only a part of my\r\nduties, my professional occupations taking most of my time. I have been\r\nfrequently questioned, especially by women, how I could reconcile family\r\nlife with a scientific career. Well, it has not been easy; it required a\r\ngreat deal of decision and of self-sacrifice. However, the family bond\r\nhas been preserved between me and my now grown-up daughters, and life is\r\nmade brighter by the mutual affection and understanding in our home,\r\nwhere I could not suffer a harsh word or selfish behavior.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, when I succeeded my husband at the Sorbonne, I had only a\r\nprovisional laboratory with little space and most limited equipment. A\r\nfew scientists and students had already been admitted to work there with\r\nmy husband and me. With their help, I was able to continue the course of\r\nresearch with good success.\r\n\r\nIn 1907, I received a precious mark of sympathy from Mr. Andrew\r\nCarnegie, who donated to my laboratory an annual income for research\r\nfellowships which enabled some advanced students or scientists to devote\r\ntheir whole time to investigation. Such foundations are very encouraging\r\nto those whose inclinations and talents are such as to warrant their\r\nentire devotion to research work. They ought to be multiplied in the\r\ninterest of science.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, I had to devote again a great deal of time to the\r\npreparation of several decigrammes of very pure radium chloride. With\r\nthis I achieved, in 1907, a new determination of the atomic weight of\r\nradium, and in 1910 I was able to isolate the metal. The operation, an\r\nextremely delicate one, was performed with the assistance of a\r\ndistinguished chemist belonging to the laboratory staff. It has never\r\nbeen repeated since that time, because it involves a serious danger of\r\nloss of radium, which can be avoided only with utmost care. So I saw at\r\nlast the mysterious white metal, but could not keep it in this state,\r\nfor it was required for further experiments.\r\n\r\nAs for the polonium, I have not been able to isolate it, its quantity in\r\nthe mineral being even much less than the quantity of radium. However,\r\nvery concentrated polonium has been prepared in my laboratory, and\r\nimportant experiments have been performed with this substance,\r\nconcerning especially the production of helium by radiation of polonium.\r\n\r\nI had to devote special care to the improvement of the measuring methods\r\nin the laboratory. I have told how important precise measurements were\r\nin the discovery of radium. It is still to be hoped that efficient\r\nmethods of quantitative determination may lead to new discoveries.\r\n\r\nI devised a very satisfactory method for determining the quantity of\r\nradium by the means of a radioactive gas produced by it and called\r\n\"emanation.\" This method, frequently used in my laboratory, permits of\r\nthe measurement of very small quantities of radium (less than a\r\nthousandth of a milligramme), with a fair precision. More important\r\nquantities are often measured by their penetrating radiation, named\r\nGamma-rays. For this we also possess in my laboratory a suitable\r\nequipment. It is easier and more satisfactory to measure the radium by\r\nthe emitted rays, than to weigh it in a balance. However, these\r\nmeasurements require the disposition of reliable standards. So the\r\nquestion of a radium standard had to be taken into careful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of radium had to be established on a solid basis, for\r\nthe benefit of laboratories and scientific research, which, of course,\r\nis in itself an important reason, and moreover, the growing medical\r\nutilization of this substance made it necessary to control the relative\r\npurity of commercially produced radium.\r\n\r\nThe first experiments on the biological properties of radium were\r\nsuccessfully made in France with samples from our laboratory, while my\r\nhusband was living. The results were, at once, encouraging, so that the\r\nnew branch of medical science, called radiumtherapy (in France,\r\n_Curietherapy_), developed rapidly, first in France and later in other\r\ncountries. To supply the radium wanted for this purpose, a\r\nradium-producing industry was established. The first plant was created\r\nin France and worked very successfully, but afterwards manufactures were\r\nfounded in other countries, the most important of which are now in\r\nAmerica, where great quantities of radium ore, named \"carnotite,\" are\r\navailable. The radiumtherapy and the radium production developed\r\nconjointly, and the results were more and more important, for the\r\ntreatment of several diseases, and particularly of cancer. As a\r\nconsequence of this, several institutes have been founded, in the large\r\ncities, for the application of the new therapy. Some of these institutes\r\nown several grammes of radium, the commercial price of the gramme being\r\nnow about $70,000, the cost of production depending on the very small\r\nproportion of radium in the ore.\r\n\r\nIt may be easily understood how deeply I appreciated the privilege of\r\nrealizing that our discovery had become a benefit to mankind, not only\r\nthrough its great scientific importance, but also by its power of\r\nefficient action against human suffering and terrible disease. This was\r\nindeed a splendid reward for our years of hard toil.\r\n\r\nThe success of the therapy depends, of course, on the precise knowledge\r\nof the quantity of radium which is used, so that the measurements of\r\nradium are as important for industry and for medicine as for\r\nphysicochemical research.\r\n\r\nConsidering all these needs, a commission of scientific men of different\r\ncountries was formed who agreed to take as a base an international\r\nstandard, formed of a carefully weighed quantity of pure radium salt.\r\nSecondary standards were then to be prepared for each country, and\r\ncompared to the basic standard by means of their radiation. I was\r\nappointed to prepare the primary standard.\r\n\r\nThis was a very delicate operation, as the weight of the standard\r\nsample, quite small (about 21 milligrammes of chloride), had to be\r\ndetermined with great precision. I performed the preparation in 1911.\r\nThe standard is a thin glass tube, of a few centimeters in length,\r\ncontaining the pure salt which was used for the determination of atomic\r\nweight. It was accepted by the Commission and is deposited in the\r\nInternational Bureau of Weights and Measures at Sèvres, near Paris.\r\nSeveral secondary standards, compared with the primary one, have been\r\nput into service by the Commission. In France the control of radium\r\ntubes, by the measurement of their radiation, takes place in my\r\nlaboratory, where any one may bring the radium to be tested; in the\r\nUnited States this is done in the Bureau of Standards.\r\n\r\nNear the end of the year 1910, I was proposed for the decoration of the\r\nLégion of Honor. A similar proposal was made earlier in favor of my\r\nhusband, who, however, being opposed to all honorary distinctions, did\r\nnot accept the nomination. As my husband and I were too united in all\r\nthings for me to act differently from him in this matter, I did not\r\naccept the decoration, in spite of the insistence of the Ministry. At\r\nthat time also, several colleagues persuaded me to be a candidate for\r\nelection to the Academy of Sciences of Paris, of which my husband was a\r\nmember during the last months of his life. I hesitated very much, as\r\nsuch a candidacy requires, by custom, a great number of personal visits\r\nto Academy members. However, I consented to offer myself a candidate,\r\nbecause of the advantages an election would have for my laboratory. My\r\ncandidacy provoked a vivid public interest, especially because it\r\ninvolved the question of the admission of women to the Academy. Many of\r\nthe Academicians were opposed to this in principle, and when the\r\nscrutiny was made, I had a few votes less than was necessary. I do not\r\never wish to renew my candidacy, because of my strong distaste for the\r\npersonal solicitation required. I believe that all such elections should\r\nbe based wholly on a spontaneous decision, without any personal efforts\r\ninvolved, as was the case for several Academies and Societies which made\r\nme a member without any demand or initiative on my part.\r\n\r\nAs a result of all the cares devolving on me, I fell seriously ill at\r\nthe end of 1911, when, for the second time, I received, this time alone,\r\nthe award of the Nobel prize. This was a very exceptional honor, a high\r\nrecognition of the discovery of the new elements and of the preparation\r\nof pure radium. Suffering though I was, I went to Stockholm to receive\r\nthe prize. The journey was extremely painful for me. I was accompanied\r\nby my eldest sister and my young daughter Irene. The ceremony of\r\ndelivery of the Nobel prizes is very impressive, having the features of\r\na national solemnity. A most generous reception was accorded me,\r\nspecially by the women of Sweden. This was a great comfort to me, but I\r\nwas suffering so much that when I returned I had to stay in bed for\r\nseveral months. This grave illness, as well as the necessities of my\r\nchildren's education, obliged me to move my home from Sceaux to Paris.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1912 I had the opportunity of collaborating in the\r\ncreation of a laboratory of radium at Warsaw. This laboratory was\r\nfounded by the Scientific Society of Warsaw which offered me its\r\ndirection. I could not leave France to go back to my native country, but\r\nI willingly agreed to occupy myself with the organization of the studies\r\nin the new laboratory. In 1913, having improved my health, I was able to\r\nattend an inauguration fête in Warsaw, where a touching reception was\r\ngiven, leaving me an unforgettable memory of national sentiment which\r\nsucceeded in creating useful work under particularly difficult political\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nWhile still only partially recovered from my illness, I renewed my\r\nefforts for the construction of a suitable laboratory in Paris. Finally\r\nit was arranged for, and work began in 1912. The Pasteur Institute\r\nwished to be associated with this laboratory, and, in accord with the\r\nUniversity, it was decided to create an Institute of Radium, with two\r\nlaboratories, one of physics and one of biology, the first to be devoted\r\nto studies of the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive\r\nelements, the second to the study of their biological and medical\r\napplications. But, because of the lack of financial means, the\r\nconstruction work proceeded very slowly, and was not yet entirely\r\nfinished when the war broke out in 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1914, it happened, as it often had in other years, that my daughters\r\nhad left Paris for their summer vacation before me. They were\r\naccompanied by their governess, in whom I had all confidence, and were\r\nliving in a small house on the seashore in Brittany, at a place where\r\nthere were also the families of several of our good friends. My work did\r\nnot generally permit me to pass the entire vacation near them without\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nThat year I was preparing to join them in the last days of July, when I\r\nwas stopped by the bad political news, with its premonitions of an\r\nimminent military mobilization. It did not seem possible for me to leave\r\nunder these conditions, and I waited for further events. The\r\nmobilization was announced on August 1st, immediately followed by\r\nGermany's declaration of war on France. The few men of the laboratory\r\nstaff and the students were mobilized, and I was left alone with our\r\nmechanic who could not join the army because of a serious heart trouble.\r\n\r\nThe historic events that followed are known to every one, but only those\r\nwho lived in Paris through the days of August and September, 1914, can\r\never really know the state of mind in the capital and the quiet courage\r\nshown by it. The mobilization was a general wave of all France passing\r\nout to the border for the defense of the land. All our interest now\r\ncentered on the news from the front.\r\n\r\nAfter the uncertainties of the first days this news became more and more\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nFirst, it was the invasion of Belgium and the heroic resistance of that\r\nlittle country; then the victorious march of the German army through the\r\nvalley of the Oise toward Paris; and soon the departure of the French\r\ngovernment to Bordeaux, followed by the leaving of those Parisians who\r\ncould not, or would not, face the possible danger of German occupation.\r\nThe overloaded trains took into the country a great number of people,\r\nmostly of the well-to-do class. But, on the whole, the people of Paris\r\ngave a strong impression of calm and quiet decision in that fateful year\r\nof 1914. In the end of August and the beginning of September the weather\r\nwas radiant, and under the glorious sky of those days the great city\r\nwith its architectural treasures seemed to be particularly dear to those\r\nwho remained in it.\r\n\r\nWhen the danger of German attack on Paris became pressing, I felt\r\nobliged to put in security the supply of radium then in my laboratory,\r\nand I was charged by the government to take it to Bordeaux for safety.\r\nBut I did not want to be away long, and hence decided to return\r\nimmediately. I left by one of the trains that were carrying government\r\nstaff and baggage, and I well remember the aspect of the national\r\nhighway which is at intervals in view from the train; it showed a long\r\nline of motor-cars carrying their owners from the capital.\r\n\r\nArriving at Bordeaux in the evening, I was very embarrassed with my\r\nheavy bag including the radium protected by lead. I was not able to\r\ncarry it and waited in a public place, while a friendly ministry\r\nemployee who came by the same train managed to find a room for me in a\r\nprivate apartment, the hotels being overcrowded. The next morning I\r\nhurried to put the radium in a safe place, and succeeded, although not\r\nwithout difficulty, in taking a military train back to Paris in the\r\nevening of the same day. Having opportunity for exchanging a few\r\nsentences with persons on the place who wanted to ask information from\r\npeople coming by the train, I was interested to notice how they seemed\r\nsurprised and comforted to learn of some one who found it natural to\r\nreturn to Paris.\r\n\r\nMy trip back was troubled by delays; for several hours the train rested\r\nimmovable on the rails, while the travelers accepted a little bread from\r\nthe soldiers who were provided with it. Finally arriving in Paris, I\r\nlearned that the German army had turned; the battle of the Marne had\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nIn Paris I shared the alternating hope and grief of the inhabitants\r\nduring the course of that great battle, and had the constant worry of\r\nforeseeing a long separation from my children in case the Germans\r\nsucceeded in occupying the city. Yet I felt that I must stay at my post.\r\nAfter the successful outcome of the battle, however, any immediate\r\ndanger of occupation being removed, I was able to have my daughters come\r\nback from Brittany to Paris and again take up their studies. This was\r\nthe great desire of my children, who did not want to stay away from me\r\nand from their work, even if many other families thought it wiser to\r\nstay in the country, far from the front.\r\n\r\nThe dominant duty imposed on every one at that time was to help the\r\ncountry in whatever way possible during the extreme crisis that it\r\nfaced. No general instructions to this were given to the members of the\r\nUniversity. It was left to each to take his own initiative and means of\r\naction. I therefore sought to discover the most efficient way to do\r\nuseful work, turning my scientific knowledge to most profit.\r\n\r\nDuring the rapid succession of events in August, 1914, it was clearly\r\nproved that the preparation for defense was insufficient. Public feeling\r\nwas especially aroused by the realization of the grave failings which\r\nappeared in the organization of the Health Service. My own attention was\r\nparticularly drawn to this situation, and I soon found a field of\r\nactivity which, once entered upon, absorbed the greatest part of my time\r\nand efforts until the end of the war, and even for some time thereafter.\r\nThe work was the organization of radiologic and radiotherapeutic\r\nservices for the military hospitals. But I also had to make the change,\r\nduring these difficult war years, of my laboratory into the new building\r\nof the Institute of Radium and to continue, in the measure possible to\r\nme, regular teaching, as well as to investigate certain problems\r\nespecially interesting the military service.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the X-rays offer surgeons and doctors extremely\r\nuseful means for the examination of the sick and wounded. They make\r\npossible the discovery and the exact location of projectiles which have\r\nentered the body, and this is a great help in their extraction. These\r\nrays also reveal lesions of bones and of the internal organs and permit\r\none to follow the progress of recovery from internal injuries. The use\r\nof the X-rays during the war saved the lives of many wounded men; it\r\nalso saved many from long suffering and lasting infirmity. To all the\r\nwounded it gave a greater chance of recovery.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the beginning of the war, the Military Board of Health had\r\nno organization of radiology, while the civil organization was also but\r\nlittle developed. Radiologic installations existed in only a small\r\nnumber of important hospitals, and there were only a few specialists in\r\nthe large cities. The numerous new hospitals that were established all\r\nover France in the first months of the war had, as a rule, no\r\ninstallation for the use of X-rays.\r\n\r\nTo meet this need I first gathered together all the apparatus I could\r\nfind in the laboratories and stores. With this equipment I established\r\nin August and September, 1914, several stations of radiology, the\r\noperation of which was assured by volunteer helpers to whom I gave\r\ninstruction. These stations rendered great service during the battle of\r\nthe Marne. But as they could not satisfy the needs of all the hospitals\r\nof the Paris region, I fitted up, with the help of the Red Cross, a\r\nradiologic car. It was simply a touring motor-car, arranged for the\r\ntransport of a complete radiologic apparatus, together with a dynamo\r\nthat was worked by the engine of the car, and furnished the electric\r\ncurrent necessary for the production of the rays. This car could come at\r\nthe call of any of the hospitals, large or small, in the surroundings of\r\nParis. Cases of urgent need were frequent, for these hospitals had to\r\ntake care of the wounded who could not be transported to more distant\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nThe first results of this work showed that it was necessary to do more.\r\nThanks to special donations and to the help of a very efficient relief\r\ncommittee called \"le Patronage National des Blessés,\" I succeeded in\r\ndeveloping my initiative to a considerable extent. About two hundred\r\nradiologic installations were established or materially improved through\r\nmy efforts in the zone of the French and Belgian armies, and in the\r\nregions of France not occupied by the army. I was able, besides, to\r\nequip in my laboratory and give to the army twenty radiologic cars. The\r\nframes of these cars were donated by various persons who wished to be\r\nhelpful; some of them offered also the equipment. The cars were of the\r\ngreatest service to the army.\r\n\r\nThese privately developed installations were particularly important in\r\nthe first two years of the war, when the regular military service\r\npossessed but few radiologic instruments. Later the Board of Health\r\ncreated, little by little, a considerable radiologic service of its own,\r\nas the utility of the stations was more clearly realized owing to the\r\nexample given by private initiative. But the needs of the armies were so\r\ngreat, that my cooperation continued necessary to the end of the war,\r\nand even afterwards.\r\n\r\nI could not have accomplished this work without seeing for myself the\r\nneeds of the ambulance stations and hospitals. Thanks to the help of the\r\nRed Cross and to the agreement of the Board of Health, I was able to\r\nmake several journeys to the army zones and to the other parts of\r\nFrance. Several times I visited the ambulance stations of the armies of\r\nthe north and in the Belgian zone, going to Amiens, Calais, Dunkirk,\r\nFurnes, and Poperinghe. I went to Verdun, Nancy, Luneville, Belfort, to\r\nCompiegne, and Villers-Cotterets. In the regions distant from the front,\r\nI took care of many hospitals which had to do very intensive work with\r\nlittle aid. And I keep as a precious recollection of that time, many\r\nletters of warm recognition from those to whom I brought help in their\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nThe motive of my starting on a journey was usually a demand from\r\nsurgeons. I went with a radiologic car which I kept for my personal use.\r\nIn examining the wounded in the hospital, I could gain information of\r\nthe special needs of the region. When back in Paris, I got the necessary\r\nequipment to meet these needs and returned to install it myself, for\r\nvery often the people on the ground could not do it. I had then to find\r\ncompetent persons to handle the apparatus and show them how to do it, in\r\nfull detail. After a few days of hard toil, the manipulator knew enough\r\nto work the apparatus himself, and at the same time a large number of\r\nwounded had been examined. In addition, the surgeons of the region had\r\ngained an idea of the usefulness of the radiologic examination (which\r\nfew of them knew at that time), and friendly relations were established\r\nwhich made the later development of my work much easier.\r\n\r\nOn several of my trips I was accompanied by my elder daughter, Irene,\r\nwho was then seventeen years old, and, having finished her preparatory\r\nstudies, was beginning higher studies at the Sorbonne. Because she\r\ngreatly desired to be useful, she now studied nursing and learned\r\nradiology, and did her best to help me under the most varied\r\ncircumstances. She did ambulance work at the front between Furnes and\r\nYpres, and also at Amiens, receiving, from the Chiefs of Service,\r\ntestimonials of work satisfactorily performed and, at the end of the\r\nwar, a medal.\r\n\r\nOf the hospital life of those years, we keep many a remembrance, my\r\ndaughter and I. Traveling conditions were extraordinarily difficult; we\r\nwere often not sure of being able to press forward, to say nothing of\r\nthe uncertainty of finding lodgings and food. However, things always\r\nended in arranging themselves, thanks to our persistence and to the good\r\nwill we met. Wherever we went I had to look after each detail myself and\r\nsee innumerable military chiefs to obtain passes and permissions for\r\ntransportation. Many a time I loaded my apparatus on to the train\r\nmyself, with the help of the employees, to make sure that it would go\r\nforward instead of remaining behind several days at the station. And on\r\narrival I also went to extract them from the encumbered station.\r\n\r\nWhen I traveled with the radiologic car, other problems presented\r\nthemselves. I had, for instance, to find safe places for the car, to get\r\nlodgings for the assistants and to secure the automobile accessories.\r\nSince chauffeurs were scarce, I learned to drive the car, and did it\r\nwhen necessary. Owing to all this personal supervision, my installations\r\nwere usually swiftly made, whereas appeal to the Central Health Service\r\nwas answered slowly. So the military chiefs greatly appreciated the\r\nassistance they could get from me, especially in cases of urgent need.\r\n\r\nWe both, my daughter and myself, have pleasant and grateful memories of\r\nthe personnel of the hospitals, and were on the best terms with the\r\nsurgeons and nurses. One could not but admire these men and women who\r\nwere giving their services without counting, and whose task was often\r\noverwhelming. Our collaboration was easy, for my daughter and I tried to\r\nwork in their spirit; and we felt that we were standing side by side\r\nwith friends.\r\n\r\nWhile we were attached to the Belgian Ambulance Service, we were present\r\nseveral times during visits of King Albert and Queen Elizabeth. We\r\nappreciated deeply their devotion, their solicitude for the wounded,\r\ntheir extreme simplicity, and the cordiality of their behavior.\r\n\r\nBut nothing was so moving as to be with the wounded and to take care of\r\nthem. We were drawn to them because of their suffering and because of\r\nthe patience with which they bore it. Almost everyone did his best to\r\nfacilitate the X-ray examination, notwithstanding the pain caused by any\r\ndisplacement. One learned very soon to know them individually and to\r\nexchange with them a few friendly words. Those who were not familiar\r\nwith the examination, wanted very much to be reassured about the effect\r\nof the strange apparatus they were going to experience.\r\n\r\nI can never forget the terrible impression of all that destruction of\r\nhuman life and health. To hate the very idea of war, it ought to be\r\nsufficient to see once what I have seen so many times, all through those\r\nyears: men and boys brought to the advanced ambulance in a mixture of\r\nmud and blood, many of them dying of their injuries, many others\r\nrecovering but slowly through months of pain and suffering.\r\n\r\nOne of my difficult problems was to find the necessary trained\r\nassistants to operate my apparatus. At the beginning of the war there\r\nwas little knowledge of radiology, and apparatus in the hands of those\r\nwho did not understand how to handle it deteriorated quickly and was\r\nsoon useless. The practice of radiology in most hospitals in war-time\r\ndoes not require much medical knowledge; it can be sufficiently grasped\r\nby intelligent persons who know how to study and who have some notion of\r\nelectrical machinery. Professors, engineers, or university students\r\noften made good manipulators. I had to look for those who were\r\ntemporarily free from military service, or who happened to be stationed\r\nin the locality where I needed them. But even after I had secured them,\r\nthese operators were often transferred by military orders, and I had to\r\nsearch again for others to fill their places. For this reason, I\r\ndetermined to train women to do this work.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I proposed to the Health Service to add a department of\r\nradiology to the Nurses' School which had just been founded at the Edith\r\nCavell Hospital. This they agreed to do. And so, in 1916, the course was\r\norganized at the Radium Institute, and provided in the following years\r\nof war for the training of one hundred and fifty operators. Most of the\r\npupils who applied had only an elementary education, but could succeed\r\nif working in a proper way. The course comprised theoretical studies and\r\nvery extended practical training; it included also some instruction in\r\nanatomy. It was given by a few persons of good will, among them my\r\ndaughter. Our graduates formed an excellent personnel very genuinely\r\nappreciated by the Board of Health. Theoretically, they were supposed to\r\nserve as aides to physicians, but several of them proved capable of\r\nindependent work.\r\n\r\nMy continued and various experience in war radiology gave me a wide\r\nknowledge of that subject, which I felt should be made more familiar to\r\nthe public. So I wrote a small book called \"Radiology and the War,\" in\r\nwhich I aimed to demonstrate the vital importance of radiology and to\r\ncompare its development during war time with its use in the previous\r\ntime of peace.\r\n\r\nI come now to the account of the founding of the service of\r\nradiumtherapy at the Radium Institute.\r\n\r\nIn 1915, the radium, which had been safely deposited in Bordeaux, was\r\nbrought back to Paris, and not having time for regular scientific\r\nresearch, I decided to use it to cure the wounded, without, however,\r\nrisking the loss of this precious material. I proceeded to place at the\r\ndisposal of the Health Service not the radium itself, but the emanation\r\nwhich can be obtained from it at regular intervals. The technique of the\r\nuse of the emanation can readily be employed in the larger radiumtherapy\r\ninstitutes, and, in many ways, is more practicable than the direct use\r\nof radium. In France, however, there was no national institute of\r\nradiumtherapy, and the emanation was not used in hospitals.\r\n\r\nI offered to furnish regularly to the Health Service bulbs of radium\r\nemanation. The offer was accepted, and the \"Emanation Service,\" started\r\nin 1916, was continued until the end of the war and even longer. Having\r\nno assistants, I had, for a long time, to prepare these emanation bulbs\r\nalone, and their preparation is very delicate. Numbers of wounded and\r\nsick, military and civil, were treated by means of these bulbs.\r\n\r\nDuring the bombardment of Paris, the Health Board took special measures\r\nto protect from shells the laboratory in which the bulbs were prepared.\r\nSince the handling of radium is far from being free of danger (several\r\ntimes I have felt a discomfort which I consider a result of this cause),\r\nmeasures were taken to prevent harmful effects of the rays on the\r\npersons preparing emanation.\r\n\r\nWhile the work in connection with the hospitals remained my major\r\ninterest, I had many other preoccupations during the war.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of the German offensive in the summer of 1918, at the\r\nrequest of the Italian government, I went to Italy to study the question\r\nof her natural resources in radioactive materials. I remained a month\r\nand was able to obtain certain results in interesting the public\r\nauthorities in the importance of this new subject.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1915 that I had to move my laboratory to the new building in\r\nthe rue Pierre Curie. This was a trying and complicated experience, for\r\nwhich, once more, I had no money nor any help. So it was only between my\r\njourneys that I was able, little by little, to do the transportation of\r\nmy laboratory equipment, in my radiologic cars. Afterwards, I had much\r\nwork in classifying and distributing my materials, and arranging the new\r\nplace in general, with the help of my daughter and of my mechanic, who,\r\nunfortunately, was often ill.\r\n\r\nOne of my first cares was to have trees planted in the limited grounds\r\nof my laboratory. I feel it very necessary for the eyes to have the\r\ncomfort of fresh leaves in spring and summer time. So I tried to make\r\nthings pleasant for those who were to work in the new building. We\r\nplanted a few lime trees and plane trees, as many as there was room for,\r\nand did not forget flowerbeds and roses. I well remember the first day\r\nof bombardment of Paris with the big German gun; we had gone, in the\r\nearly morning, to the flower-market, and spent all that day busy with\r\nour plantation, while a few shells fell in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the great difficulties, the new laboratory was organized\r\nlittle by little, and I had the satisfaction of having it quite ready\r\nfor the beginning of the school-year 1919-20, the period of\r\ndemobilization. In the spring of 1919, I organized special courses for\r\nsome American soldier students, who also studied with much zeal the\r\npractical exercises directed by my daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by U. S. Signal Corps._\r\n\r\nMme. Curie instructing American soldiers in her Paris laboratory.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entire period of the war was for me, as for many others, a period of\r\ngreat fatigue. I took almost no vacation, except for a few days, now and\r\nthen, when I went to see my daughters on their holidays. My older\r\ndaughter would scarcely take any, and I was obliged to send her away\r\nsometimes to preserve her health. She was continuing her studies in the\r\nSorbonne, and besides, as said before, was helping me with my war work,\r\nwhile the younger daughter was still in the preparatory college. Neither\r\nof them wished to leave Paris during the bombardment.\r\n\r\nAfter more than four years of a war which caused ravages without\r\nprecedent, the armistice came at last, in the autumn of 1918, followed\r\nby laborious efforts to reëstablish peace, which is not yet general nor\r\ncomplete. It was a great relief to France to see the end of that dark\r\nperiod of cruel losses. But the griefs are too recent and life still too\r\nhard for calm and happiness yet to be restored.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a great joy came to me as a consequence of the victory\r\nobtained by the sacrifice of so many human lives. I had lived, though I\r\nhad scarcely expected it, to see the reparation of more than a century\r\nof injustice that had been done to Poland, my native country, and that\r\nhad kept her in slavery, her territories and people divided among her\r\nenemies. It was a deserved resurrection for the Polish nation, which\r\nshowed herself faithful to her national memories during the long period\r\nof oppression, almost without hope. The dream that appeared so difficult\r\nto realize, although so dear, became a reality following the storm that\r\nswept over Europe. In these new conditions I went to Warsaw and saw my\r\nfamily again, after many years of separation, in the capital of free\r\nPoland. But how difficult are the conditions of life of the new Polish\r\nrepublic, and how complicated is the problem of reorganization after so\r\nmany years of abnormal life!\r\n\r\nIn France, partly devastated and suffering from the loss of so many of\r\nher citizens, the difficulties created by the war are not yet effaced,\r\nand the return to normal work is being attained only gradually. The\r\nscientific laboratories feel this state of affairs and the same\r\ncondition prevails for the Radium Institute.\r\n\r\nThe various radiologic organizations created during the war still\r\npartially exist. The Radiographic Nurses' School has been maintained at\r\nthe request of the Board of Health. The emanation service, which could\r\nnot be abandoned, is also continued in a considerably enlarged form. It\r\nhas passed under the direction of Doctor Regaud, Director of the Pasteur\r\nLaboratory of the Radium Institute, and is developing into a great\r\nnational service of radiumtherapy.\r\n\r\nThe work of the laboratory has been reorganized, with the return of the\r\nmobilized personnel and the students. But in the restrained\r\ncircumstances under which the country still exists, the laboratory lacks\r\nways and means for its efficient development. Particularly are wanted an\r\nindependent hospital for radiumtherapy (which is called _Curietherapy_\r\nin France), and an experimental station, outside of Paris, for\r\nexperiments on great quantities of material, such as are needed for the\r\nprogress of our knowledge of radioactive elements.\r\n\r\nI myself am no longer young, and I frequently ask myself whether, in\r\nspite of recent efforts of the government aided by some private\r\ndonations, I shall ever succeed in building up for those who will come\r\nafter me an Institute of Radium, such as I wish to the memory of Pierre\r\nCurie and to the highest interest of humanity.\r\n\r\nHowever, a precious encouragement came to me in the year 1921. On the\r\ninitiative of a generous daughter of the United States, Mrs. W. B.\r\nMeloney, the women of that great American country collected a fund, the\r\n\"Marie Curie Radium Fund,\" and offered me the gift of a gramme of radium\r\nto be placed entirely at my disposal for scientific research. Mrs.\r\nMeloney invited me with my daughters to come to America and to receive\r\nthe gift, or the symbol of it, from the hands of the President of the\r\ngreat republic, at the White House.\r\n\r\nThe fund was collected by a public subscription, as well by small as by\r\nimportant gifts, and I was very thankful to my sisters of America for\r\nthis genuine proof of their affection. So I started for New York at the\r\nbeginning of May, after a ceremony given in my honor at the Opera of\r\nParis, to greet me before my departing.\r\n\r\nI keep a grateful memory of my sojourn in the United States for several\r\nweeks, of the impressive reception at the White House, where President\r\nHarding addressed me in generous and affectionate words, of my visits to\r\nthe universities and colleges which welcomed me and bestowed on me their\r\nhonorary degrees, of the public reunions where I could not but feel the\r\ndeep sympathy of those who came to meet me and to wish me good luck.\r\n\r\n\r\n[[Illustration: _Henri Manuel, Paris._\r\n\r\nMadame Curie in her laboratory at the Institut Curie, Paris.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI had also the opportunity of a visit to the Niagara Falls and to the\r\nGrand Canyon, and admired immensely these marvelous creations of nature.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, the precarious state of my health did not permit of the\r\ncomplete fulfilment of the general plan established by my visit to\r\nAmerica. However, I saw and learned much, and my daughters enjoyed to a\r\nfull extent the opportunities of their unexpected vacation and the pride\r\nin the recognition of their mother's work. We left for Europe at the end\r\nof June, with the real sorrow of parting from excellent friends whom we\r\nwould not forget.\r\n\r\nI came back to my work, made easier by the precious gift, with an even\r\nstronger desire to carry it forward with renewed courage. But as my aims\r\nare still wanting support in essential parts, I am frequently compelled\r\nto give thought to a very fundamental question concerning the view a\r\nscientist ought to take of his discovery.\r\n\r\nMy husband, as well as myself, always refused to draw from our discovery\r\nany material profit. We have published, since the beginning, without any\r\nreserve, the process that we used to prepare the radium. We took out no\r\npatent and we did not reserve any advantage in any industrial\r\nexploitation. No detail was kept secret, and it is due to the\r\ninformation we gave in our publications that the industry of radium has\r\nbeen rapidly developed. Up to the present time this industry hardly uses\r\nany methods except those established by us. The treatment of the\r\nminerals and the fractional crystallizations are still performed in the\r\nsame way, as I did it in my laboratory, even if the material means are\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nAs for the radium prepared by me out of the ore we managed to obtain in\r\nthe first years of our work, I have given it all to my laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe price of radium is very high since it is found in minerals in very\r\nsmall quantities, and the profits of its manufacture have been great, as\r\nthis substance is used to cure a number of diseases. So it is a fortune\r\nwhich we have sacrificed in renouncing the exploitation of our\r\ndiscovery, a fortune that could, after us, have gone to our children.\r\nBut what is even more to be considered is the objection of many of our\r\nfriends, who have argued, not without reason, that if we had guaranteed\r\nour rights, we could have had the financial means of founding a\r\nsatisfactory Institute of Radium, without experiencing any of the\r\ndifficulties that have been such a handicap to both of us, and are still\r\na handicap to me. Yet, I still believe that we have done right.\r\n\r\nHumanity, surely, needs practical men who make the best of their work\r\nfor the sake of their own interests, without forgetting the general\r\ninterest. But it also needs dreamers, for whom the unselfish following\r\nof a purpose is so imperative that it becomes impossible for them to\r\ndevote much attention to their own material benefit. No doubt it could\r\nbe said that these idealists do not deserve riches since they do not\r\nhave the desire for them. It seems, however, that a society well\r\norganized ought to assure to these workers the means for efficient\r\nlabor, in a life from which material care is excluded so that this life\r\nmay be freely devoted to the service of scientific research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nMy beautiful voyage to the United States of America resulted, as is\r\nknown, from the generous initiative of an American woman, Mrs. Meloney,\r\neditor of an important magazine, the _Delineator_, who, having planned\r\nthe gift of a gramme of radium to me by her countrywomen, succeeded in a\r\nfew months in bringing this plan to execution, and asked me to come over\r\nand receive the gift personally.\r\n\r\nThe idea was that the gift would come exclusively from the American\r\nwomen. A committee including several prominent women and distinguished\r\nscientific men received some important gifts, and made an appeal for a\r\npublic subscription, to which a great number of women's organizations,\r\nespecially colleges and clubs, responded. In many cases gifts came from\r\npersons who had experienced the benefit of radiumtherapy. In this way\r\nwas collected the \"Marie Curie Radium Fund\" of more than one hundred\r\nthousand dollars for the purchase of a gramme of radium. The President\r\nof the United States, Mr. Harding, kindly agreed to deliver the gift in\r\na ceremony at the White House.\r\n\r\nThe Committee invited me and my daughters to the United States in May,\r\nand even though it was not vacation time for me, I accepted the\r\ninvitation with the consent of the University of Paris.\r\n\r\nAll care of the voyage was taken away from me. Mrs. Meloney came to\r\nFrance in time to be present at a manifestation organized on the 28th of\r\nApril in favor of the Radium Institute of Paris by the magazine _Je Sais\r\nTout_, and accompanied by sincere expressions of sympathy for the\r\nAmerican nation. On May 4th, we took passage at Cherbourg on the\r\n_Olympic_ for New York.\r\n\r\nThe program of my voyage prepared by the Committee seemed very\r\nintimidating. It was announced that I would not only attend the ceremony\r\nat the White House, but also visit many universities and colleges in\r\nseveral towns. Some of these institutions had contributed to the Fund;\r\nall desired to offer me honors. The vitality and the activity of the\r\nAmerican nation produces programs on a large scale. On the other hand,\r\nthe wideness of the country has developed in American citizens the\r\ncustom of long travel. But during all that travel I was protected with\r\nthe greatest care, in order to lighten as far as possible the inevitable\r\nfatigue of the voyage and the receptions. America not only gave me a\r\ngenerous welcome, but also true friends whom I could not thank enough\r\nfor their kindness and their devotion.\r\n\r\nAfter having admired the grand view of the harbors of New York, and\r\nhaving been greeted by groups of students, Girl Scouts, and Polish\r\ndelegates, and welcomed by many gifts of flowers, we took possession of\r\na peaceful apartment in town. The following day I made the acquaintance\r\nof the Reception Committee at a luncheon given by Mrs. Carnegie in her\r\nbeautiful home still filled with memories of her husband, Andrew\r\nCarnegie, whose philanthropic achievements are well known in France. The\r\nfollowing day we went for a visit of a few days to Smith College, and\r\nVassar College, a few hours from New York. Later I also visited the\r\ncolleges of Bryn Mawr and Wellesley, and I saw some others on my way.\r\n\r\nThese colleges, or universities for women, are very characteristic of\r\nAmerican life and culture. My short visit could not permit me to give an\r\nauthorized opinion on the intellectual training, but even in such a\r\nvisit as I made one may notice important differences between the French\r\nand American conception of girls' education, and some of these\r\ndifferences would not be in favor of our country. Two points have\r\nparticularly drawn my attention: the care of the health and the physical\r\ndevelopment of the students, and the very independent organization of\r\ntheir life which allows a large degree of individual initiative.\r\n\r\nThe colleges are excellent in their construction and organization. They\r\nare composed of several buildings, often scattered in very large grounds\r\nbetween lawns and trees. Smith is on the shore of a charming river. The\r\nequipment is comfortable and hygienic, of extreme cleanliness, with\r\nbathrooms, showers, distribution of cold and hot water. The students\r\nhave cheerful private rooms and common gathering rooms. A very complete\r\norganization of games and sports exists in every college. The students\r\nplay tennis and baseball; they have gymnasium, canoeing, swimming, and\r\nhorseback riding. Their health is under the constant care of medical\r\nadvisers. It seems to be a frequent opinion of American mothers that the\r\nexisting atmosphere of cities like New York is not favorable to the\r\neducation of young girls, and that a life in the country in the open air\r\ngives more suitable conditions for the health and the tranquillity of\r\nstudying.\r\n\r\nIn every college the young girls form an association and elect a\r\ncommittee which has to establish the internal rules of the college. The\r\nstudents display a great activity: they take part in educational work;\r\nthey publish a paper; they are devoted to songs and music; they write\r\nplays, and act them in college and out of it. These plays have\r\ninterested me very much in their subjects and the execution. The\r\nstudents are also of different social conditions. Many of them are of\r\nwealthy families, but many others live on scholarships. The whole\r\norganization may be considered as democratic. A few students are\r\nforeigners, and we have met some French students very well pleased with\r\nthe college life and the studies.\r\n\r\nEvery college takes four years of study with examinations from time to\r\ntime. Some students afterwards do personal work, and acquire the degree\r\nof Doctor, which does not exactly correspond to the same title in\r\nFrance. The colleges have laboratories with many good facilities for\r\nexperimentation.\r\n\r\nI have been strongly impressed by the joy of life animating these young\r\ngirls and expanding on every occasion, like that of one of my visit. If\r\nthe ceremonies of the reception were performed in a nearly military\r\norder, a spontaneity of youth and happiness expressed itself in the\r\nsongs of greeting composed by the students, in the smiling and excited\r\nfaces, and in the rushing over the lawns to greet me at my arrival. This\r\nwas indeed a charming impression which I could not forget.\r\n\r\nBack in New York, several ceremonies awaited me before my leaving for\r\nWashington. A luncheon of the Chemists, a reception at the Museum of\r\nNatural History and the Mineralogical Club, a dinner at the Institute of\r\nSocial Sciences, and a great meeting at Carnegie Hall, where many\r\ndelegations represented the faculties and students of women's colleges\r\nand universities. At all these receptions I was greeted in warm\r\naddresses by prominent men and women, and I received honors very\r\nprecious to me because of the sincerity of the givers. Neither has the\r\npart of national friendships been forgotten; the address of\r\nVice-President Coolidge was a noble recognition of the past where French\r\nand Polish citizens have been helpful to the young American Republic,\r\nand is also a statement of fraternity strengthened by the tempest of the\r\nlast years.\r\n\r\nIt was in this atmosphere of affection created by the convergence of\r\nintellectual and social sympathies that there took place on May 20th the\r\nbeautiful ceremony at the White House. It was a deeply moving ceremony\r\nin all its simplicity, occurring before a democratic gathering including\r\nthe President and Mrs. Harding, cabinet officers, Judges of the Supreme\r\nCourt, high officers of Army and Navy, foreign diplomats,\r\nrepresentatives of women's clubs and societies, and prominent citizens\r\nof Washington and other cities. It comprised a short presentation by the\r\nFrench ambassador, M. Jusserand, a speech by Mrs. Meloney for the\r\nAmerican women, the address of President Harding, a few words of\r\ngratitude said by me, a defile of the guests, and a group picture for a\r\nsouvenir, all this in the admirable setting of the White House, peaceful\r\nand dignified, white indeed between its green lawns with wide prospects\r\non that beautiful afternoon of May. A remembrance never to be forgotten\r\nwas left by this reception in which the chief representative of a great\r\nnation offered me homage of infinite value, the testimonial of the\r\nrecognition of his country's citizens.\r\n\r\nThe address of the President had been inspired by the same sentiments as\r\nthat of Vice-President Coolidge, as far as concerned his appreciation of\r\nFrance and Poland. This address gave also an expression of the American\r\nfeeling which was emphasized by an exceptional solemnity in the\r\ndelivering of the gift.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright International._\r\n\r\nMme. Curie and President Harding at the White House, May 20, 1921, when\r\na gram of radium was presented to its discoverer by the women of\r\nAmerica.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American nation is generous, and always ready to appreciate an\r\naction inspired by considerations of general interest. If the discovery\r\nof radium has so much sympathy in America, it is not only because of its\r\nscientific value, and of the importance of medical utilization; it is\r\nalso because the discovery has been given to humanity without\r\nreservation or material benefits to the discoverers. Our American\r\nfriends wanted to honor this spirit animating the French science.\r\n\r\nThe radium itself was not brought to the ceremony. The President\r\npresented me with the symbol of the gift, a small golden key opening the\r\ncasket devised for the transportation of the radium.\r\n\r\nOur sojourn at Washington following the principal ceremony included a\r\nvery agreeable reception at the French Embassy and the Polish Legation,\r\na reception at the National Museum, and some laboratory visits.\r\n\r\nThe itinerary of our journey from Washington included visits to the\r\ncities of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Buffalo, Boston, and New\r\nHaven, a visit to the Grand Canyon, and to Niagara Falls. On that trip I\r\nwas the guest of several universities which did me the honor of\r\nbestowing honorary degrees on me. I have to thank for these the\r\nuniversities of Pennsylvania, of Pittsburgh, of Chicago, the\r\nNorthwestern University, Columbia University, Yale University, the\r\nWomen's Medical College of Pennsylvania, the University of Pennsylvania,\r\nSmith College, and Wellesley College, while I thank Harvard University\r\nfor her reception.\r\n\r\nThe delivery of honorary degrees in American universities is accompanied\r\nby solemnities. In principle, the presence of the candidate is required,\r\nand the delivery takes place at the annual commencement, but, in some\r\ncases, special ceremonies were organized in my favor. The university\r\nceremonies in America are more frequent than in France, and play a more\r\nimportant part in the university life. Especially is this true at the\r\nannual commencement, which begins with an academic procession over the\r\ngrounds of the university, the procession including the officials, the\r\nprofessors, and graduates in academic caps and gowns. Afterwards all\r\nassemble in a hall where are announced the diplomas corresponding to the\r\ngrades of bachelor, master, and doctor. There is always a musical part\r\nin the program, and addresses are delivered by the officials of the\r\nuniversity or invited orators. These addresses are naturally devoted to\r\ndignifying the ideals and the humanitarian purposes of education; but in\r\ncertain cases it seems permitted to introduced point of American humor.\r\nThese ceremonies are on the whole very impressive, and certainly\r\ncontribute to keep a bond between the university and the alumni. This is\r\na favorable circumstance for those great American universities which are\r\nsustained entirely on private foundations. It is only in more recent\r\ntimes that most States have created universities supported by the State.\r\n\r\nAt Yale University I had the pleasure of representing the University of\r\nParis at the inauguration of President Angell, fourteenth president of\r\nthe University. I was also pleased to attend at Philadelphia a meeting\r\nof the American Philosophical Society and a meeting of the College of\r\nPhysicians, and at Chicago a meeting of the American Chemical Society at\r\nwhich I delivered a lecture on the Discovery of Radium. The medals of\r\nJohn Scott, Benjamin Franklin, and Willard Gibbs have been presented to\r\nme by these societies.\r\n\r\nSeveral meetings organized in my honor by the American women's\r\norganizations have particularly interested the American public. I have\r\nalready mentioned the meeting of the University Women at Carnegie Hall\r\nof New York; a similar meeting was held at Chicago, where I was also\r\nreceived by the Association of Polish Women. I was also greeted by\r\nwomen's organizations in the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh, and by a\r\ndelegation of Canadian university women at Buffalo. In all these\r\nmeetings it was impossible not to recognize the sincerity of the emotion\r\nin the women who gave me their best wishes, at the same time expressing\r\ntheir confidence in the future of feminine intelligence and activity. I\r\ndid not feel any opposition between these feministic aspirations and the\r\nmasculine opinion. As far as I could notice, the men in America approve\r\nof these aspirations and encourage them. This is a very favorable\r\ncondition for the social activity of the American women which reveals\r\nitself in a strong interest in work for education, for hygiene, and for\r\nthe improvement of conditions of labor. But any other unselfish purpose\r\nmay rely on their support, as is proved by the success of Mrs. Meloney's\r\nplan, and by the sympathy this plan encountered in women of all social\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nI could not, to my deep regret, give time enough to the visit to\r\nlaboratories and scientific institutes. These too brief visits were of\r\ngreat interest to me. I found everywhere the greatest care for\r\ndeveloping scientific activity and for improving the facilities. New\r\nlaboratories are in building, and in older laboratories very modern\r\nequipment may be found. The available room never gives that impression\r\nof insufficiency from which we suffer too often in France. The means are\r\nprovided by private initiative expressed in gifts and foundations of\r\nvarious kinds. There exists also a National Council of Research\r\nestablished by private funds for stimulating and improving scientific\r\nwork, and for assuring its connection with industry.\r\n\r\nI have visited with special interest the Bureau of Standards, a very\r\nimportant national institution at Washington for scientific measurements\r\nand for study connected with them. The tubes of radium presented to me\r\nwere at the Bureau, whose officials had kindly offered to make the\r\nmeasurements, and to take care of the packing and delivery to the ship.\r\n\r\nA new laboratory has been created at Washington for researches on very\r\nlow temperatures with the use of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium. I\r\nhad the honor of dedicating this laboratory to its service.\r\n\r\nI had the great pleasure of meeting in their laboratories several very\r\nimportant American scientific men. The hours I spent in their company\r\nare among the best of my travel.\r\n\r\nThe United States possesses several hospitals for radiumtherapy. These\r\nhospitals are generally provided with laboratories for the extraction of\r\nradium emanation which is sealed up in small tubes for medical use.\r\nThese institutions own important quantities of radium, have a very good\r\nequipment, and treat a great number of patients. I have visited some of\r\nthem, and this made me feel more deeply, if possible, the regret of not\r\nhaving in France even one national institute capable of rendering the\r\nsame services. I hope that this lack will be filled in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe industry of radium has been started in France, but it is in America\r\nthat it has had its greatest development, owing to the presence of a\r\nsufficient supply of the ore carnotite.[15] I was very much interested\r\nin my visit to the most important of the factories, and I gladly\r\nrecognize the spirit of initiative in this undertaking. The factory owns\r\na collection of documentary films which enable one to appreciate the\r\neffort made each day in collecting the ore scattered in the immense\r\nfields of Colorado, in carrying and concentrating this ore originally\r\nvery poor in radium. On the other hand, the means of extraction of\r\nradium are still the same which have been described in earlier chapters.\r\n\r\nThe greatest courtesy was paid me in my visit to the radium plant and\r\nlaboratory. I found the same reception at a factory of mesothorium which\r\npresented me with some material, and where the officials expressed the\r\ndesire to help in my scientific work.\r\n\r\nTo make complete these travel impressions it would be necessary to speak\r\nof the nature of the country. I recoil before the task, being incapable\r\nof expressing in a few words the immensity and the variety of the spaces\r\nwhich opened before my eyes. The general impression is one of unlimited\r\npossibilities for the future. I keep a particularly vivid remembrance of\r\nthe great falls of Niagara, and of the magnificent colors of the Grand\r\nCanyon.\r\n\r\nOn June 28th I embarked in New York on the same ship which had brought\r\nme to the United States less than two months before. I would not take\r\nthe liberty, after so short a period of time, of giving an opinion on\r\nAmerica and the Americans. I would only say how deeply I have been\r\ntouched by the warm reception which was tendered everywhere to me and my\r\ndaughters. Our hosts wanted to make us feel that we were not with\r\nstrangers; and, on the other hand, many of them assured me that they\r\nfelt in entirely friendly surroundings when on the soil of France. I got\r\nback to France with a feeling of gratitude for the precious gift of the\r\nAmerican women, and with a feeling of affection for their great country\r\ntied with ours by a mutual sympathy which gives confidence in a peaceful\r\nfuture for humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Quite recently there has been started near Anverst an\r\nimportant radium industry as a result of the discovery of uranium ore in\r\nthe Belgian Congo.]",
