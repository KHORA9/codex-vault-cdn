Some words of apology are also due that\r\nI, a learner myself, should aspire to instruct others. I cannot do\r\nbetter, therefore, than tell the history of this book from its birth,\r\nand in so doing cancel both obligations. The little history will be a\r\nsort of _OPHIDIANA_, or gossip about snakes; and in this I only follow\r\nthe example of most herpetologists, who, when writing exclusively on\r\nthese reptiles, preface their work with some outline of the history of\r\nophiology, and generally with an excuse for introducing the unwelcome\r\nsubject at all. There is still reason to lament that traditional\r\nprejudice invests everything in the shape of a serpent with repulsive\r\nqualities, and that these prejudices are being only very slowly swept\r\naway by the besom of science.\r\n\r\nSerpents are intimately associated with our religious beliefs. Not\r\nthat we _worship_ them! Far otherwise. Many excellent and orthodox\r\npersons associate with a serpent all the sin and misery which ever\r\nexisted on our globe, and are persuaded that the sooner everything in\r\nthe shape of one is exterminated the better.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those who can look at a snake with unprejudiced eyes\r\nand study its habits, find continual reason to wonder at and admire the\r\nextraordinary features which exhibit themselves in its organization.\r\nOwing to their retiring habits, many of them nocturnal, and partly in\r\nconsequence of preconceived errors, less is understood about them than\r\nalmost any other natural group of animals; therefore—as the reader\r\nwill discover—a student, when left to himself, has to wade through\r\nages of writers in order to find out what to believe regarding them.\r\nScientific ophiologists are still engaged in settling mooted questions\r\nconcerning them. But apart from science there is a glamour of poetry,\r\nromance, and mystery about snakes, and not without reason. There has\r\nbeen a great deal of what we may call ‘Drawing-room Natural History’\r\nof late years—charmingly sensational and romantic; attractive also in\r\nillustrations and colouring, but not always intended as reliable guides\r\nfor students.\r\n\r\nAll travellers are not naturalists; and though they may contribute\r\nvaluable information in one branch of science, it is possible they may\r\nmislead in another; and from the very popularity of their books, such\r\nerrors are rapidly disseminated. I aspire to a place on drawing-room\r\ntables for my book also, but let me assure my readers that my aim has\r\nbeen to assist by diligent search to establish truthfulness. Whatever\r\nof romance or sensation attaches to it, is due to the marvellous powers\r\nof the creatures who fill its pages, and whose true nature I have\r\nlaboured to comprehend.\r\n\r\nSchlegel and Dumeril are two authorities on serpents much quoted by\r\nEnglish writers, and both give us a list of all the naturalists of\r\nrepute who have done service to herpetology, up to the date of their\r\nworks. As many of these are introduced in the body of my work, let\r\nus glance at the progress of ophiology since the date of these two\r\ndistinguished authors. In zoology as much as in any branch of science\r\nprogressiveness is observable; and in zoology the advance of ophiology\r\nhas of late years been remarkable. In 1843, when Schlegel’s _Essai sur\r\nla Physionomie des Serpents_, 1837, was translated into English by Dr.\r\nThos. Stewart Traill, of the University of Edinburgh, he mentioned as a\r\nreason for curtailing the original (and not adding the atlas containing\r\n421 figures, with charts and tables), that the low state of ophiology\r\nin this country did not invite a larger work, and ‘deters booksellers\r\nfrom undertaking such costly illustrations;’ but he hoped to be useful\r\nto science by cultivating a branch of zoology hitherto neglected. Ten\r\nyears prior to that date, viz. 1833, the monthly scientific magazine\r\n_The Zoologist_ was started; in introducing which the Editor, Mr. Ed.\r\nNewman, wrote: ‘To begin, the attempt to combine scientific truths with\r\nreadable English has been considered by my friends one of surpassing\r\nrashness;’ that he had ‘many solicitations to desist from so hopeless\r\na task,’ and many ‘supplications to introduce a few Latin descriptions\r\nto give it a scientific character,’ science being then confined to\r\nthe scientific alone. Nevertheless the _Zoologist_ has survived half a\r\ncentury, and under able editorship has taken its stand as a popular as\r\nwell as scientific journal. Formerly you might have hunted the pages of\r\nsuch magazines year after year without finding mention of an ‘odious\r\nsnake;’ but within the last decade, not only this but other periodicals\r\nhave frequently opened their pages to ophiology, and a considerable\r\nremoval of prejudice is noticeable.\r\n\r\nMr. Newman felt encouraged by the success attending the publication\r\nof White’s _Selborne_, that being one of the first works to induce a\r\npractical study of nature. Yet, until the appearance of Bell’s _British\r\nReptiles_ in 1849, our present subject occupied but very stinted space\r\nin literature. Indeed, we must admit that as a nation we English have\r\n_followed_, not _taken_, the lead as naturalists. So long ago as\r\n1709, Lawson in his _History of Carolina_ lamented the ‘misfortune\r\nthat most of our Travellers who go to this vast Continent are of the\r\nmeaner Sort, and generally of very slender Education; hired laborers\r\nand merchants to trade among the Indians in remote parts.’ ... ‘The\r\nFrench outstrip us in nice Observations,’ he said. ‘First by their\r\nnumerous Clergy; their Missionaries being obedient to their Superiors.’\r\nSecondly by gentlemen accompanying these religious missions, sent out\r\nto explore and make discoveries and to keep strict journals, which duly\r\nwere handed over to science. And what Lawson remarked of the American\r\ncolonies was extended to wherever the French, Portuguese, and Italians\r\nestablished religious communities. We find our book-shelves ever\r\nenriched by foreign naturalists.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, also, ophiology was far in advance of us. Lenz, Helmann,\r\nEffeldt, and many others pursued the study practically; and produced\r\nsome valuable results in their printed works, which unfortunately are\r\ntoo little known in England. Doubtless because we in England have so\r\nfew native reptiles, there is less inducement to concern ourselves\r\nabout them. Not so in America, where herpetology soon found many\r\nenthusiasts; and the researches of Holbrooke, Emmons, De Kay, and Weir\r\nMitchell were published within a few years of each other. Dr. Cantor\r\nin India, and Dr. Andrew Smith in South Africa, Drs. Gray and Günther\r\nand P. H. Gosse in England, all enriched ophiological literature\r\nprevious to 1850, to say nothing of the valuable additions to the\r\nscience dispersed among the _Reports_ and _Transactions_ of the various\r\nscientific Societies. After the appearance of Dr. Günther’s important\r\nwork, _The Reptiles of British India_, in 1864, published under the\r\nauspices of the Ray Society, another fresh impetus was observable, and\r\nwe had Krefft’s _Snakes of Australia_, 1869; _Indian Snakes_, by Dr. E.\r\nNicholson, 1870; culminating in _The Thanatophidia of India_, by Sir\r\nJoseph, then Dr. Fayrer, F.R.S., C.S.I., etc., Surgeon-Major of the\r\nBengal Army, in 1872, which brings me to the commencement of my own\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I knew nothing whatever about snakes; and to them,\r\nthough deriving my chief pleasures from an inherited love of all\r\nthings in nature, a faint interest _at a respectful distance_, was\r\nall I accorded. In Virginia and Florida, where a country life and a\r\ngorgeous flora enticed my steps into wild and secluded districts, we\r\nnot unfrequently saw them and one or two ‘narrow escapes’ seasoned\r\nthe pages of my notebook. When in such rambles we caught sight of one,\r\nwe flew at our utmost speed, encountering the far greater danger of\r\ntreading on a venomous one in our precipitous flight, than in shunning\r\nthe probably innocent one from which we were fleeing.\r\n\r\nMy first startling adventure in Virginia was more ridiculous than\r\ndangerous. We were about to cross a little rivulet that ran rippling\r\nthrough a wood, in which there were many such to ford. Often fallen\r\nboughs or drifting logs, dragged into the shallow parts by the negroes,\r\nserved as stepping-stones. These becoming blackened in the water, and\r\npartially covered with tangled drift-weed, were so familiar a sight\r\nthat, without pausing to observe, I was making a spring, when my\r\ncompanion caught hold of my dress, crying out, ‘Don’t step on them!\r\nThey will bite you!’ The supposed shining and tangled boughs were\r\ntwo large black snakes commonly known as ‘Racers,’ enjoying a bath;\r\nbut until I had hastily regained the top of the bank, alarmed at the\r\nexcitement of my young friend, I did not discover the nature of our\r\nintended stepping-stones. The snakes were not venomous, but very\r\n‘spiteful,’ and might have resented the interruption by sharp bites. In\r\nmoving, they probably would have caused me to fall upon them and into\r\nthe water, when they might have attacked me with unpleasant results.\r\nNow, however, my chief vexation was that they got away so quickly, I\r\ncould learn nothing about them.\r\n\r\nAnother ‘escape’ was on an intensely hot day, when in early morning\r\nwe had started for a botanical ramble. Our way lay along a sloping\r\nbit of pasture land, bounded on the east and higher ground by a dense\r\nwood, which afforded shelter from the sun. Beguiled on and on, among\r\nthe lovely copses of exquisite flowering shrubs and a wealth of floral\r\ntreasures which carpeted the turfy slopes, we were unconscious of time.\r\n\r\nThough only in the merry month of May, blackberries of enormous size\r\nand delicious flavour, trailing on long briars yards and yards over the\r\nmossy grass, invited us to break our fast; and, all unmindful of the\r\nbreakfast-hour, we feasted and rested.\r\n\r\nSuddenly we found ourselves no longer shaded by the wood to the east\r\nof us, for the sun had mounted high; and at the first touch of his\r\nscorching rays as we rose to our feet, we glanced at each other in\r\ndismay, for we had open ground to cross in getting home. My Virginia\r\ncompanion said that it would be better to ford the streams in the wood,\r\nthan risk sunstroke by crossing a cornfield, our nearest way home.\r\n\r\nThis we decided to do, and having surmounted all obstacles, were almost\r\nwithin earshot of the house, when Ella, with a shriek, started and ran\r\nback, exclaiming, ‘A moccasin!’\r\n\r\n‘What? where?’ I eagerly inquired, trying to follow the direction of\r\nher eye.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, Miss Hopley, come back! Quick! Come away! Water moccasins are\r\nworse than rattlesnakes, for they dart at you!’\r\n\r\nSufficiently alarming, certainly; yet I wanted to _see_ the terrible\r\nobject, and ascertain how far off it was, and at length discovered\r\nthe head and neck of a snake erect. About a foot of it was visible,\r\nand might have been taken for a slight stem or stick standing\r\nperpendicularly out of the swampy herbage bordering the narrow path.\r\nThe fixed eyes and darting ‘sting’—which I then thought the tongue to\r\nbe—seemed to endorse the character my young friend had given it. Yet\r\nI lingered, ‘fascinated,’ no doubt, by its gaze, the fascination in my\r\ncase partaking of curiosity chiefly. The reptile remained so rigid that\r\nI was inclined to venture nearer; nor did I welcome the idea of having\r\nto retrace our steps and risk the open field under that Virginia sun.\r\nBut Ella would not hear of passing the deadly snake. There were others,\r\nshe was sure, in that swampy part.\r\n\r\nWell, we reached home at last, more dead than alive, having discarded\r\nour treasured specimens and substituted sprays of enormous leaves with\r\nwhich to shield our heads from the sun. And I have ever reflected, that\r\nof the two dangers—snakes and sunstroke—we risked the greater in\r\ntraversing that cornfield at such an hour.\r\n\r\nBesides that ‘deadly moccasin’ and frequent ‘black snakes,’ there\r\nwere ‘whip snakes,’ ‘milk snakes,’ and many others which the negroes\r\nwould bring home as trophies of their courageous slaughter; but by no\r\nscientific names were they known there. Except this name _moccasin_\r\nor _mokeson_, which probably conveyed some especial meaning to the\r\naborigines, few of the Indian vernaculars have been preserved in the\r\nUnited States, as we find them in other parts of America, which latter\r\nare treated of in chapters xxii. and xxiii. of this work; but common\r\nEnglish names prevail.\r\n\r\nAfter a time I proposed to write a book about snakes, starting with the\r\nstereotyped ideas that they all ‘stung’ in some incomprehensible way;\r\nthat the larger kinds crushed up horses and cattle like wisps of straw;\r\nand that all, having viciously taken the life of the victim, proceeded\r\nwith epicurean gusto to lick it all over and smear it with saliva, that\r\nit might glide down their throat like an oyster! There are those who to\r\nthis day believe the same.\r\n\r\nMy proposed book was, however, simply to recount some adventures\r\namong the snakes which were encountered in our American rambles. It\r\nwas intended for the amusement of juvenile readers, and to supplement\r\nthe little work about my pet birds[1], which had met with so kind and\r\nencouraging a reception.\r\n\r\nBut in order to merely recount an adventure with a snake, some\r\nknowledge of the reptile is essential. One must, at least, be sure\r\nof the correct name of the ‘horrid thing’ which lifted its ‘menacing\r\nhead’ a few feet in front of us; such local names as ‘black snake’ and\r\n‘moccasin snake’ affording no satisfactory information.\r\n\r\nNor were hasty references to books much more satisfactory. Mr. P. H.\r\nGosse had been over the same ground, gathering many interesting items\r\nof natural history; but in his _Letters from Alabama_ I could not\r\ndecide on my moccasin snake. From this and his other works, and then\r\nfrom the authors quoted by him, I discovered only that there were\r\nmany ‘black snakes,’ some deadly, others harmless. The same with the\r\n‘moccasin’ snake, which was now of this colour, now of that. While one\r\nwriter expatiates on the beauty of the ‘emerald snake,’ a ‘living\r\ngem, which the dark damsels of southern climes wind round their necks\r\nand arms,’ another describes snakes of emerald green which are dreaded\r\nand avoided. One traveller tells of a ‘coral snake’ whose bite is\r\nfatal within an hour; while elsewhere a ‘coral snake’ is petted and\r\nhandled. Equally perplexing were the ‘carpet snakes,’ ‘whip snakes,’\r\n‘Jararacas,’ and ‘brown snakes.’\r\n\r\nNor were names the only puzzle to unravel; for in almost every other\r\nparticular writers on snakes are at variance.\r\n\r\nThose ‘moccasin snakes’ in Virginia were venomous, I was sure, having\r\nknown of accidents from their bite. Hoping to become enlightened as to\r\ntheir true name and character, I repaired to the Zoological Gardens to\r\nascertain if they were known there. Yes; there were several together\r\nin one cage, labelled ‘Moccasins’ (_Tropidonotus fasciatus_) ‘from\r\nAmerica;’ but to identify them with the one in Virginia, of which I\r\nhad seen only a short portion from a distance, was impossible. To add\r\nto the perplexity, Holland the keeper assured me these were ‘quite\r\nharmless.’\r\n\r\n‘But are you _sure_ these are harmless snakes? They are poisonous in\r\nAmerica.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, miss, they have bitten my finger often enough for me to know,’\r\nreturned Holland.\r\n\r\n‘Then there must be _two_ kinds of moccasin snakes,’ I argued, ‘for\r\nthe others are _extremely_ venomous;’ and I related my Virginia\r\nexperiences, and that I had known of a horse bitten by one that had\r\ndied in an hour or so, fearfully swollen.\r\n\r\n‘They have never hurt me,’ persisted Holland.\r\n\r\nSubsequently I discovered that in the United States this name\r\n_moccasin_ is a common vernacular, first and chiefly applied to a\r\nreally dangerous viper, _Ancistrodon pugnax_ or _piscivorus_, the\r\none, most likely, that we saw in the wood; and secondly, to a number\r\nof harmless snakes which are _supposed_ to be dangerous, and of which\r\nthose at the Gardens, _Tropidonotus fasciatus_, are among the latter.\r\nThus at the very outset the puzzles began.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, after some research I learnt enough of snake nature to\r\nfeel safe in proceeding with my book of _Adventures_, and in presenting\r\nit to a publisher.\r\n\r\n‘As a gift-book no one would look at it, and as an educational work\r\nthere would be no demand for it,’ was its encouraging reception.\r\n\r\nThis was about ten years ago; and so far from inducing me to relinquish\r\nthe subject, I began to aspire to become a means of assisting to\r\novercome these prejudices. For the space of two years the anticipated\r\n‘sequel’ to my _American Pets_ went the round of the London publishers\r\nof juvenile works, and to several in Scotland. It was read by many\r\nof them, who professed to have been unexpectedly and ‘extremely\r\ninterested’ in it—‘_but_’—none could be persuaded to ‘entertain so\r\nrepulsive a subject.’ One member of a publishing house distinguished\r\nfor the high standard of its literature, positively admitted among\r\nhis insurmountable objections, that when a child his mother had never\r\npermitted him to look through a certain favourite volume late in\r\nthe day, ‘for fear the pictures of snakes in it should prevent his\r\nsleeping!’\r\n\r\nAn editor of a magazine told me he should lose his subscribers if he\r\nput snakes in its pages; and another made excuse that his children\r\nwould not look at the magazine with a snake in it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is not so surprising when we reflect that until within\r\na late date snakes in children’s books, if represented at all,\r\nare depicted as if with full intent of creating horror. They are\r\nrepresented with enormously extended jaws, and—by comparison with\r\nthe surrounding trees or bushes—of several hundred feet in length;\r\nsometimes extending up a bank or over a hedge into the next field, or\r\nwinding round a rock or a gnarled trunk, that must be—if the landscape\r\nhave any pretensions to perspective—a long way off. Slender little\r\ntree snakes of two or three feet long are represented winding round\r\nand round thick stems and branches strong enough to support you. Into\r\nthe chasm of a mouth from which an enormous instrument (intended for a\r\ntongue) is protruding, a deer the size of a squirrel (by comparison),\r\nor a squirrel the size of a mouse, is on the point of running meekly to\r\nits doom.\r\n\r\nNo wonder children ‘skip’ the few pages devoted to snakes in\r\ntheir natural history books, and grow up full of ignorance and\r\nprejudices regarding them. In no class of literature are original and\r\nconscientious illustrations more required than to replace some of those\r\nwhich reappear again and again, and have passed down from encyclopædias\r\ninto popular works, conveying the same erroneous impressions to each\r\nunthinking reader.\r\n\r\nThe strongly-expressed opinions of publishers convinced me that the\r\nprejudices of adults must first be overcome before children could be\r\npersuaded to look at a snake as they would look at a bird or a fish,\r\nor to enter the Reptile House at the Zoological Gardens without the\r\npremeditated ‘Aughs!’ and ‘Ughs!’ and shudders.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years that witnessed the MS. of _Aunt Jenny’s\r\nAdventures_ lying in first one and then another publishing house, an\r\nespecial occurrence acted as a great stimulant, and induced an almost\r\nobstinate persistence in my apparently hopeless studies.\r\n\r\nThis was the sensation caused by the daily papers in reporting the\r\ncase of ‘Cockburn _versus_ Mann;’ and the ‘SNAKES IN CHANCERY.’ To\r\nthe horror and dismay of the ‘general public,’ Mr. Mann, of Chelsea,\r\nwas represented as ‘keeping for his amusement _all manner of venomous\r\nserpents_;’ or, as another paper put it, ‘Mr. Mann had a peculiar\r\npenchant for keeping as domestic pets a large number of venomous\r\nsnakes.’ (I copy verbatim from the papers of that date.) That these\r\n‘water vipers and puff adders’ were ‘apt to stray in search of\r\nfreedom;’ or, ‘being accustomed to take their walks abroad,’ had\r\nstrayed into the neighbours’ gardens, to the terror of maid-servants\r\nand children;’ and were ‘now roaming up and down Cheyne Walk,’ and\r\n‘turning the College groves into a garden of Eden.’ So an action was\r\nbrought against Mr. Mann: for the neighbours decided that ‘there was no\r\nbetter remedy for a stray cobra than a suit in Chancery.’ ‘Everybody’\r\nduring July 1872 was reading those delightfully sensational articles,\r\nand asking, ‘_Have_ you heard about Mr. Mann’s cobras?’\r\n\r\nMr. Frank Buckland was brave enough to venture into the dangerous\r\nprecincts of Cheyne Walk, and even into the house of Mr. Mann, to test\r\nthe virtues and vices of both the ‘pets’ and their possessors. He\r\nfinally tranquillized the public mind by publishing accounts of his\r\nvisit, affirming that not _one_ of the snakes was venomous, but, on\r\nthe contrary, were charmingly interesting and as tame as kittens. The\r\ntestimony of so popular an authority served not only to allay local\r\nterrors, but to modify the sentence that might otherwise have been\r\npassed on the ophiophilist, who was merely cautioned by the honourable\r\njudge to keep his pets within due bounds.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Mr. and Mrs. Mann and their domesticated ophidians held\r\ndaily receptions. I was invited to see them, and in company with a\r\nclerical friend repaired to Chelsea. It was the first family party\r\nof snakes I had ever joined, and I must confess to considerable\r\nfluctuations of courage as we knocked at the door. Nor could one quite\r\ndivest oneself of apprehension lest the boa-constrictors to which we\r\nwere introduced should suddenly make a spring and constrict us into a\r\npulp. But they didn’t. On the contrary, towards ourselves they were\r\ndisappointingly undemonstrative, and only evinced their consciousness\r\nof the presence of strangers by entwining themselves about the members\r\nof the family, as if soliciting their protection. They were very\r\njealous of each other, Mr. Mann said; jealous also of other company, as\r\nif unwilling to lose their share of attention. There were half-a-dozen\r\nor more snakes—viz., several boas, of whom ‘Cleo,’ or Cleopatra, has\r\nbecome historical; two or three lacertine snakes from North Africa; and\r\na common English snake. The smaller ones were regaled on frogs for our\r\nspecial edification. At that time I had never been to the Reptilium at\r\nthe Zoological Gardens on feeding days, and when Mr. Mann permitted a\r\nfrog to hop about the table, and we saw the ring snake glide swiftly\r\ntowards it and catch it in its mouth, we could not comprehend what was\r\nto happen next. ‘What _will_ he do with it?’ we both exclaimed. We had\r\nnot long to wait. Somehow or other the frog, caught by its hind leg,\r\ngot turned round till its head was in the snake’s mouth and the hind\r\nlegs were sprawling and kicking, but in vain. Then head-foremost it\r\nvanished by degrees into the jaws of the snake; while the head of the\r\nlatter, ‘poor thing,’ seemed dislocated out of all shape! It was a\r\nwonderful but painful sight; for how the snake’s head stretched in that\r\namazing manner, and how the frog was drawn into the mouth, was past our\r\ncomprehension.\r\n\r\nAn equally wonderful but far more attractive sight was Mrs. Mann,\r\na graceful and charming little lady in black velvet, with Cleo\r\ncoiling around her in Laocoon-like curves. The rich colouring of the\r\nbeautifully-marked reptile entwining the slender form of the woman, the\r\npicturesque and caressing actions of Cleo, and the responsive repose\r\nof Mrs. Mann as the snake was now round her waist, now undulating\r\naround and over her head and neck, was altogether a sight never to\r\nbe forgotten. Two sweet little children were equally familiar with\r\nthe other boas, that seemed quite to know who were their friends and\r\nplay-fellows, for the children handled them and patted and talked to\r\nthem as we talk to pet birds and cats.\r\n\r\nSuch were the ‘vipers, cobras, and puff adders’ that had figured in the\r\ndaily papers.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the reptile house at the Zoological Gardens became a\r\nnew attraction. From there to the bookshelves and back again to the\r\nGardens, my little book of adventures was discarded for a more\r\nambitious work; but still was confronted by disaffected publishers,\r\nwhom even the Chelsea snakes failed to convince of public interest.\r\n\r\nFriends protested—and still demand—even while I write—‘How _can_\r\nyou give your mind to such odious, loathsome, slimy creatures?’ and\r\nI boldly reply, ‘In the hope of inducing you to believe that they\r\nare _not_ odious and loathsome, and especially not “slimy,” but in\r\nthe majority graceful, useful, beautiful, _wonderful_!’ And I invite\r\nthem to accompany me to the Zoological Gardens, and endeavour there\r\nto contemplate a reptile as they look at the other denizens of the\r\nGardens, simply as a member of the wide family of the brute creation,\r\nappointed by the Great All-wise to live and feed and enjoy existence\r\nas much as the rest, and that have to accomplish the purpose for which\r\nthey were created equally with the feathered families which we admire\r\nand—devour!\r\n\r\nAnd as whatever may be original or novel in this book has been obtained\r\nat the Zoological Gardens, I now invite my readers to accompany me in\r\nimagination to the Ophidarium, where we may learn how that little ring\r\nsnake was able to swallow his prodigious mouthful without separating it\r\nlimb from limb, as a carnivorous mammal would divide the lamb it has\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\n‘But’—you exclaim in horror—‘we do not wish to contemplate so\r\npainful, so repulsive a spectacle! How _could_ you, how _can_ you,\r\nstand coolly there and see that poor frog tortured and swallowed alive?’\r\n\r\nDear, tender-hearted reader, I did not, I _could_ not, unmoved,\r\ncontemplate this sight at first; nor for a very long while could I\r\nbring myself to watch a living creature being drawn into that living\r\ntrap. Nor could we—you and I—feel aught but horror in visiting a\r\nslaughter-house and watching a poor calf slowly die. Nor could we, for\r\npleasure merely, look coolly on at a painful surgical operation. Yet we\r\nknow that such things must be. The life of the snake is as important\r\nas that of the frog. If we are to talk about cruelty, this book of\r\nnatural history, and of intended—let me say, of hoped-for—usefulness,\r\nwould become one of political economy instead. We might discuss the\r\nsport of the angler, the huntsman; the affairs of the War Office;\r\nof railroad managers and of road-makers; the matters of the Society\r\nfor the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; followed by an examination\r\ninto the questions that have been ventilated in so-called ‘benevolent\r\norgans;’ and how some of them employ writers who in every tenth line\r\nbetray their ignorance of the creatures they attempt to describe. Not\r\neven theology could be dispensed with in this work; for, since the time\r\nwhen Adam was told to have ‘dominion over the fish of the sea, and\r\nover the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon\r\nthe earth,’ the question of ‘cruelty’ has never been satisfactorily\r\nsolved. Morally and broadly, let us understand it to mean _unnecessary_\r\ntorture—pain and suffering that can be _avoided_, and which offers\r\na very wide scope indeed. In the animal world, ‘every creature is\r\ndestined to be the food of some other creature;’ and by these economies\r\nonly is the balance of nature maintained. Happily we are spared the\r\ntoo vivid realization of the destruction of life ceaselessly going on\r\nthroughout creation; the myriads of insects destroyed each moment by\r\nbirds, the sufferings inflicted by the feline families and by birds\r\nof prey, the countless shoals of the smaller fish devoured—swallowed\r\n_alive_ too!—by larger ones, or caught (and not too tenderly) for\r\nour own use. These things we dismiss from our minds, and accept as\r\ninevitable. We do not ventilate them in daily journals. Nor do we\r\ntake our children to the slaughter-house or the surgery for their\r\nentertainment; or repair thither ourselves for the sake of minutely\r\ndiscussing afterwards the sufferings we have witnessed. You will,\r\nI hope, discover that the pain inflicted by the constrictor or the\r\nviper is not, after all, so acute as it is by some imagined to be. The\r\nvenomous bite of the latter causes almost immediate insensibility; the\r\nfrog which the ring snake ate probably died of suffocation, which also\r\nproduces insensibility; the constriction of the boa—in its natural\r\ncondition—produces also a speedy death. Besides, as Dr. Andrew Wilson,\r\nin a paper on this subject, has explained to us, the sufferings of a\r\nfrog or a rat are not like _our_ sufferings. Their brain and nerves are\r\nof a lower order.[2]\r\n\r\nPermit me, therefore, in the outset, to dismiss from these pages the\r\nquestion of cruelty as not being a branch of zoology; and as we cannot\r\nprevent snakes from eating frogs, or the vipers from catching field\r\nmice (nor need we wish to do so, or the small quarry would soon become\r\ntoo many for us), let us examine the curious construction of a snake’s\r\nhead and jaw-bones that enables it to accomplish the task so easily.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the rapid development of science, it has been said\r\nthat a scientific work is old as soon as the printer’s ink is dry. Up\r\nto the moment of sending my concluding pages to press, I realize this;\r\nand remarkably so in the growing interest in the Ophidia. Writings on\r\nthis subject are becoming so frequent that, while correcting proofs, I\r\nam tempted to add footnotes enough almost for another volume.\r\n\r\nSeveral circumstances have combined to enrich ophiological literature\r\nwithin a few years; one which, in 1872, I quite think established a\r\nsort of new era in this branch of zoology, was the appearance of Dr.\r\nFayrer’s magnificent work, _The Thanatophidia of India_. Mr. Bullen,\r\nthen the Superintendent of the Reading-Room at the British Museum,\r\nknowing that the subject was engaging my attention, informed me of the\r\narrival of this book, and, with his ever kind thought for students,\r\nordered it into the room for my express use; and I think I may affirm,\r\nthat I was the very first ‘reader’ who had the privilege of inspecting\r\nthe work, and, I hope, of helping to make it popular. For as day after\r\nday those huge folio leaves stood open, with the conspicuous and\r\nlifelike illustrations almost moving before your eyes, readers would\r\nlinger and gaze, acquaintances would stop to inquire and inspect; some\r\nwith a shudder would ask ‘how on earth I could endure the sight of such\r\nfearful creatures?’ while a few would manifest sufficient interest and\r\nintelligence to be indulged with a full display, and to whom I eagerly\r\naired my convictions of the tremendous errors afloat concerning the\r\nsnake tribe.\r\n\r\n‘Beyond the pale of science but little is known of Ophiology,’ were\r\nFayrer’s words. Two years previously to this, in 1870, Dr. Edward\r\nNicholson wrote his book, _Indian Snakes_, ‘in the hope of dispelling\r\nthe lamentable ignorance regarding some of the _most beautiful and\r\nharmless_ of God’s creatures.’\r\n\r\nThis enthusiasm is gradually spreading, and we now not unfrequently\r\nhear of domesticated snakes in English homes; both from friends\r\nwho keep them, and from the correspondence of the _Field, Land and\r\nWater_, and similar papers, in whose columns inquiries for information\r\nare often made regarding ophidian pets. Lord Lilford, one of the\r\nkindest patrons of the London Reptilium, has, I believe, for many\r\nyears been a practical ophiologist. There is one little favourite\r\nsnake that figures in these pages of which his lordship gave an\r\nexcellent character from personal acquaintance, ‘the beautiful species\r\n_Elaphis-quater-radiatus_, as being the most naturally tame of all the\r\ncolubrines, never hissing or trying to bite though frequently handled.’\r\nA noble lady not long since carried a pet snake to the Gardens. It was\r\ntwined round her arm, where it remained quiet and content, though to\r\nthe alarm of some monkeys who caught sight of it. Some members of our\r\nRoyal Family, with the enlightened intelligence which displays itself\r\nin them all, have more than once paid visits to the Reptile House at\r\nthe Zoological Gardens, where the keeper has enjoyed the high honour of\r\ntaking snakes out of their cages to place in royal hands. The good-will\r\nand interest towards the inmates of the Ophidarium are likewise\r\ndisplayed by some country gentlemen in presents of game, in the form\r\nof ring snakes for the Ophiophagus and frogs for the lesser fry. Lord\r\nArthur Russell, Lord Lilford, and other distinguished personages set\r\nexcellent examples of this kind. All of which proofs of prejudices\r\novercome are features in the history of ophiology, and especially in\r\nthe last decade.\r\n\r\nThen, in glancing at recent literature, a great change is discernible,\r\nmore particularly so during the last two years, since the popular\r\ncontributions of Dr. Arthur Stradling, a corresponding member of the\r\nZoological Society, have imparted a novel interest to this branch of\r\nzoology. To this gentleman my own most grateful acknowledgments are\r\ndue, as will be evident to the reader, not only for the zest imparted\r\nby his correspondence from Brazil, but for some important specimens\r\npresented to me by him, which have enabled me to describe them\r\nminutely from personal observations, as well as to add some original\r\nillustrations from them. Though my work and my studies were far\r\nadvanced, previous to his valued acquaintance, yet I have been able to\r\nenrich my pages from his experience, and have added footnotes from his\r\npublished writings.\r\n\r\nAlready, however, some few dispassionate students of nature among\r\neditors were promoters of herpetology, and I must here express my\r\nacknowledgments to the talented daughters of the lamented Mrs. Alfred\r\nGatty (and editresses of that _facile princeps_ among juvenile\r\nperiodicals, _Aunt Judy’s Magazine_), for having been the first\r\nto encourage and accept from my pen a snake in their pages, and\r\nsubsequently several papers on ophidian manners and habits for their\r\nmagazine.\r\n\r\nIn preparing ‘Sketches of the Ophidians’ for the _Dublin University\r\nMagazine_, December 1875, and January and February 1876 (in all, about\r\nforty closely-written pages), I, by request of the editor, included\r\na paper on the venom and the various remedies, though, reluctant to\r\nintrude within the arena of professional science, a sort of summing\r\nup of evidence was all that I attempted. Having been thus required to\r\nglean some crude ideas from technical writings (which necessitated\r\nglossaries and dictionaries to be ever at hand), I again add a chapter\r\non the ‘Venoms’ to my present work. Left entirely to my own independent\r\nconclusions, if I have ventured to think in opposition to some popular\r\nwriters, and have even presumed to offer some suggestions of my own, I\r\ntrust I may be treated with clemency.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the terrible death-rate from snake-bite in India, it\r\ndoes, however, appear to me that journalists who hold up their hands\r\nin horror, and write strong articles on this subject, lose sight of\r\nthe religious and social condition of the low-caste Hindûs, who are\r\nthe chief sufferers, and whose superstition is so fatal to them.\r\n_Snake-worship_ is the root of the evil! _Education_ must lower the\r\ndeath-rate. During the visit of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales to India,\r\nthe entire programme was on one occasion interrupted because some\r\nHindû children, to whom a feast was to be given, could not eat in\r\nthe presence of Christians, whose ‘shadow would have polluted their\r\nfood,’ or some obstacle of this nature. Similar difficulties arise when\r\nthey are snake-bitten; their creed prohibits their having recourse to\r\napproved remedies. ‘Snake-charmers’ and native quacks are sent for\r\ninstead, and often when cures are possible the fatalists submit to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nTo Professor Owen, who six years ago permitted me the honour of\r\ndedicating this contemplated work to him, and to others who were then\r\nled to expect its early appearance, I may be allowed to offer an excuse\r\nfor tardiness. Like the creatures which fill its pages, I succumb to\r\nthe chills of winter, and depend on the suns of summer for renewed\r\nvigour and activity. At one time impaired health, and the enforced\r\nsuspension of literary pursuits under the threatened loss of the use of\r\nmy right hand, were grievous interruptions.\r\n\r\nFilial duties and domestic bereavements caused another two years’\r\ndelay. Banished to the seaside, and the pen prohibited during the\r\nwinter of 1874-75, I had almost despaired of turning my studies to\r\naccount, when a new impulse arrived in the shape of a note from the\r\neditor of _Chambers’s Journal_, begging to know if my ‘work on the\r\nOphidia was out, and by whom published’? My ‘work on the Ophidia’?\r\nCould that mean my poor, despised little book that had been long ago\r\nsubmitted among others to those Edinburgh publishers? _My work on the\r\nOphidia!_ I began to get better from that day; and from that date,\r\nMarch 1875, I have had the inexpressible pleasure and privilege of\r\nincluding among my kindest and most sympathetic ophiological friends,\r\nthe Editor of that popular journal. On the Ophidia, he entrusted me\r\nwith work in various directions, encouraged by which I again returned\r\nto town, and to the Zoological Gardens.\r\n\r\nIf I am so fortunate as to afford instruction or entertainment in the\r\nfollowing pages, my readers will join me in congratulating ourselves\r\non the possession of so large and valuable a zoological collection as\r\nthat in the Regent’s Park, without which this book could not have been\r\nattempted. And I may embrace this opportunity of expressing my sincere\r\nthanks to the President and Council of the Zoological Society for the\r\nprivileges and facilities afforded me at their Gardens, where not only\r\nthe Reptilium but the annual series of zoological lectures there, given\r\nby the first biologists of the day, have been of inexpressible use to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI would also express my thanks to Professor Flower, Hunterian Professor\r\nat the Royal College of Surgeons, London, for his invariable courtesy\r\nin facilitating my examination of the ophiological specimens in the\r\nmuseum of that College, to which my honoured father (himself a member)\r\nattributed all the love of the study of natural history which from our\r\nearliest recollections were encouraged in his children. My thanks are\r\nalso due to Dr. Günther of the British Museum for similar facilities\r\nthere. Indeed, the words of encouragement given me, no less than six\r\nyears ago, by the distinguished heads of the zoological department\r\nof our great national collection, sustained my courage in opposition\r\nto all counter influences _outside_ the British Museum. When first\r\ncontemplating and presenting some outline of this work to Dr. Günther,\r\nhe honoured me by expressing his opinion that such a book was ‘much\r\nneeded;’ that it would be ‘extremely useful and interesting.’ He was\r\neven so kind as to promise to state this opinion in writing to any\r\npublisher who might consult him on the subject. I here claim the\r\npleasure of thanking my present publishers for dispensing with the\r\nnecessity of troubling Dr. Günther, and for entrusting me with the\r\npreparation of this book, which, before a chapter of it was completed,\r\nthey engaged to publish. Deficient as I feel it to be, it is at length\r\nlaunched on the doubtful waters of public criticism. If any scientific\r\neyes honour it with a glance, they will with clemency remember that,\r\nwith no scientific knowledge whatever to start with, I have had to\r\ngrope my way unaided, plodding over technicalities which in themselves\r\nwere studies; and if, as no doubt is the case, any misapprehension of\r\nsuch technicalities has here and there crept in and misinterpreted the\r\ntrue meaning, I anxiously trust that the truth has not been altogether\r\nobliterated by such obscurities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me not omit a grateful tribute to the invariable\r\nkindness of the heads of the Reading-Room at the British Museum;\r\nand for their assistance in obtaining books of which I might never\r\nhave known. The kindness of Mr. Garnett extended even beyond the\r\nReading-Room; for while I was invalided at the seaside, and could only\r\nread, _not write_, he translated and forwarded to me some important\r\npages from Lenz, a German ophiologist. To him, therefore, the thanks of\r\nthe reader are also due.\r\n\r\nIn the choice of illustrations my aim has been rather to exemplify a\r\nfew leading features than to attract by brilliantly-figured examples.\r\nSome of the woodcuts are borrowed from Günther’s and Fayrer’s works;\r\nothers I have drawn faithfully from natural specimens; but in them\r\nall I am indebted to the kind and patient work of Mr. A. T. Elwes in\r\nreproducing my own imperfect attempts. And as it was impossible to draw\r\na snake _in action_ from life, or to witness a second time the precise\r\ncoils or movements which had at first struck me as remarkable, the\r\ncomposition of some of these subjects was by no means an easy one. Our\r\nunited efforts have been to represent the natural actions as far as\r\npossible, and this I hope may commend them to the reader.\r\n\r\nThere are few English persons who have not relatives in India,\r\nAustralia, America, and Africa, and from whom they are continually\r\nhearing of escapes or accidents from snakes. Many letters from these\r\nfriends beyond the seas find place in the columns of the daily\r\njournals. Whether, therefore, naturalists or not, a very large class of\r\nthe intelligent public claims an anxious interest in the Serpent race,\r\nand to all of whom my OPHIDIANA or snake gossip is hopefully addressed.\r\n\r\n  CATHERINE C. HOPLEY.\r\n\r\n  LONDON, _October 1882_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNAKES:\r\n\r\n_CURIOSITIES AND WONDERS OF SERPENT LIFE._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n_SEEING A SNAKE FEED._\r\n\r\n\r\nIN any person who for the first time witnesses a snake with prey\r\njust captured, the predominant feeling must be one of surprise at\r\nthe seemingly unmanageable size of the animal it has seized; and he\r\nprobably exclaims to himself, or to his companion, as we did on the\r\noccasion described in the introduction, ‘What will he do with it?’\r\nLet us again take our common ring snake, _Coluber natrix_, that ate a\r\nfrog for our edification; only, in the present instance, instead of\r\nseeing a tame snake in a private residence at Chelsea, we will suppose\r\nourselves to be watching one on the banks of a stream in fine summer\r\nweather. A slight movement in the grass causes us to turn our eyes\r\ntowards the spot, and we are just in time to see the quick dash, and\r\nthe next instant a recalcitrant frog held aloft in the jaws of a snake\r\nthat with elevated head glides up the bank. Coluber’s head is no bigger\r\nthan a filbert, and the frog is nearly full grown, its body inflated\r\nto twice its original size, and its legs, of impracticable length and\r\nangles, kicking remonstrantly.\r\n\r\n‘How in the world is the snake going to manage it?’ again you exclaim,\r\nand your amazement is not exceptional. It is what has been witnessed\r\nand heard weekly in London when the public were admitted to the\r\nReptilium on feeding days, and it is what the reader will recall in his\r\nown case when first informed that a snake was going to swallow that\r\nmonstrous mouthful undivided.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance, the injury to froggie’s feelings thus far\r\npartakes more of moral than of physical pain, for the grasp of the\r\nsnake is not violent, and he finds that the more he struggles the\r\nmore he injures himself. Yet he kicks and struggles on, at thus being\r\nforcibly detained against his will. In the mouth of the snake he is\r\nas proportionately large as the shoulder of mutton in the jaws of\r\nthe dog that has just stolen it from the butcher’s shop. How do the\r\ncanines manage unwieldy food? The dog can tackle the joint of meat, big\r\nthough it be, because he has limbs to aid him, and he was prepared for\r\nemergencies before he stole it. He knew of a certain deserted yard up\r\na passage close by, and of some lumber stacked there; he watched his\r\nopportunity, and is off to his hiding-place; and once hidden behind the\r\nlumber, he settles down quietly with his ill-gotten dinner firmly held\r\nbetween his fore-paws, while, with eyes and ears on the alert, he gnaws\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe snake, no doubt, knows of a hole in the bank, or in a hollow\r\ntree, in which he can hide if alarmed; but he cannot set his frog down\r\nfor one instant, nor can he relax his jaws in the slightest degree,\r\nor his dinner hops away, and he has to pursue it, or wait for another\r\nfrog, when the same thing may happen again. He has only his teeth to\r\ntrust to, and these have all the work of paws and claws, and nails\r\nand talons, to accomplish, while yet, not for one instant, must they\r\nrelinquish their hold.\r\n\r\n‘Besides!—how much too big that frog is for Coluber’s small mouth!’\r\nAnd we continue to gaze in wonderment, filled with amazement that\r\nbrings us to the bookshelves, to endeavour to comprehend the\r\nphenomenon. Not, however, until we have seen the end of that frog on\r\nthe banks of the stream, where the reader is supposed to be waiting.\r\n\r\nFirst, let me explain that in the manner of feeding, snakes may\r\nbe divided into three classes, viz. those that kill their prey by\r\nconstriction or by smothering it in the coils of their body; those\r\nthat kill by poison; and some smaller kinds, which, like the ring\r\nsnake, eat it alive—the latter a quick process, which may also be\r\nsaid to be death by suffocation. Our little Coluber is in a spot where\r\nwe can watch it easily; so we keep rigidly still, and soon perceive\r\nthat though the snake just now had hold of froggie’s side, he now has\r\nthe head in his mouth. How can this be? and how has he managed to\r\nshift it thus, almost imperceptibly, while seeming to hold it still?\r\nNow the head begins to disappear, and the snake’s jaws stretch in a\r\nmost distorted fashion, as if dislocated; its head expands out of all\r\noriginal shape, while slowly, slowly, the frog is drawn in as if by\r\nsuction. Now its legs are passive; they no longer kick right and left,\r\nbut lie parallel, as by degrees they also vanish, and only the four\r\nfeet remain in sight. These presently have been sucked in, and the\r\nskin of the snake is stretched like a knitted stocking over the lump\r\nwhich tells us just how far down Coluber’s neck the frog has reached.\r\nGradually the lump gets farther and farther down, but is less evident\r\nas it reaches the larger part of the body. The snake remains still for\r\na few moments till his jaws are comfortably in place again; then he\r\nyawns once or twice, and finally retires for his siesta, and we to the\r\nbookshelves.\r\n\r\n‘Snakes work their prey down through the collapsed pharynx,’ says\r\nGünther. That is, the muscles of the throat seize upon what is\r\npresented to them, and do their part, as in other animals. Only, in\r\nmost other animals there is the _action_ of swallowing, one mouthful\r\nat a time; whereas in serpents the action is continuous, the throat\r\ngoing on with the work begun by the teeth, which in a snake is\r\nonly grasping and working the food in with a motion so gradual as\r\nto simulate suction. The reason why the head and jaws have been so\r\nenormously stretched and distorted, is because all the bones are, in\r\ncommon language, _loose_; that is, they are not consolidated like the\r\nhead-bones of higher animals, but united by ligaments so elastic as\r\nto enable them to separate in the way we have seen. This extends to\r\nthe jaws, and even to the palate, which is also armed with teeth, two\r\nrows extending backwards. The lower jaw or mandible being extremely\r\nlong, the elastic ligament by which the pair of bones is connected\r\nin front, forming the chin, enables them to separate widely and move\r\nindependently. This is the case in a lesser degree with the palate\r\nbones, and the upper jaw-bones, all six being furnished with long,\r\nfine, recurved, close-set teeth, adapted for _grasping_ and _holding_,\r\nbut not for dividing or for mastication in any way.\r\n\r\nFor, as we have seen, if a snake were to open its mouth one moment\r\nfor the purpose of what we call _biting_, the prey would escape. In\r\naddition to a very unusual length, the lower jaw is joined to the\r\nskull by an extra bone,—one which is not found in mammals, but only,\r\nI think, in birds,—a long ‘tympanic’ bone, which forms an elbow, and\r\npermits of that wide expansion of the throat necessary for the passage\r\nof such large undivided prey.\r\n\r\nThe illustration of the skeleton of a cobra, on p. 33, will enable\r\nthe student to distinguish the principal head-bones. There is so much\r\nsimilarity of construction throughout the whole ophidian families\r\nthat a cobra is chosen here, because the unusually long anterior ribs\r\nwhich form the hood can be observed, and the expansion of which is\r\ndescribed elsewhere. The longer teeth in the upper jaw are here fangs;\r\nthe inclination of the other rows of teeth and the bones sufficiently\r\nillustrate those of the non-venomous kinds generally, such as the\r\nlittle ring snake that has just swallowed his frog. A few of the larger\r\nconstricting snakes possess an additional bone—an intermaxillary in\r\nfront between the upper jaws, very small, yet sometimes furnished with\r\ntwo or four teeth, thus facilitating the expansion of the jaws as well\r\nas the retention of the food.\r\n\r\nIt is this adaptive development of head-bones that enabled _Coluber\r\nnatrix_ to turn his frog round to a more convenient position, and then\r\ndraw it into his mouth so gradually that we scarcely comprehended how\r\nit disappeared. The six rows of small teeth form six jaws so to speak,\r\neach one of which advanced a very little, while the other five were\r\nengaged in holding firmly. In those largest pythons which have the\r\nlittle bone in front between the two upper jaw-bones (intermaxillary)\r\nwe may say there are _seven_ jaws. As those gigantic snakes have to\r\ndeal with proportionately large and strong prey, they are thus enabled\r\nto retain and manage it.\r\n\r\nIn the graphic language of Professor Owen let me recapitulate.\r\n\r\nThe mouth can be opened laterally or transversely, as in insects, as\r\nwell as vertically, as in other vertebrates. The six jaws are four\r\nabove and two below, each of which can be protruded or retracted\r\nindependently of the others. ‘The prey having been caught and held,\r\none jaw is then unfixed by the teeth of that jaw being withdrawn and\r\npushed forward, when they are again unfixed farther back upon the prey;\r\nanother jaw is then unfixed, protruded, and re-attached, and so with\r\nthe rest in succession. This movement of protraction, being almost\r\nthe only one of which they are susceptible, while stretched apart to\r\nthe utmost by the bulk of the animal encompassed by them: and thus by\r\ntheir successive movements, the prey is slowly introduced into the\r\ngullet.’[3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Skeleton of a Cobra (from Owen’s _Anatomy of the\r\nVertebrates_).]\r\n\r\nThis working of the jaws would be almost imperceptible excepting to\r\na very close observer. In the lower jaw-bones the independent action\r\ncan be more readily perceived and is often very grotesque, one side of\r\nthe mouth opening while the other is closed, conveying the idea of the\r\nreptile making grimaces at you; but the gradual disappearance of the\r\nprey so much more bulky than the snake itself is quite incomprehensible\r\nuntil we are acquainted with the remarkable phenomena of the six rows\r\nof teeth acting independently. Thus, in turning the frog round to\r\nadjust it to a more convenient position, the jaws acted like hands in\r\nmoving, dragging, or shifting some cumbrous article, say a carpet or\r\na plank, when the left hand follows the movement of the right hand\r\nuntil the plank or carpet is worked round or forward in the required\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe form and arrangement of the fine claw-shaped teeth assist the\r\nprocess. They are too close together, and the pressure is too slight\r\nto inflict a wound; they merely retain what they hold, and it is in\r\nvain for the prey to struggle against them, or it might get some ugly\r\nscratches as they all incline backwards. In chapter xix. illustrations\r\nof teeth, life-size, show their forms and direction; here it only need\r\nbe added regarding them, that the above description refers chiefly to\r\nthe non-venomous snakes.\r\n\r\nThe palate being covered with that armoury of teeth, the snake must\r\nhave but a slight sense of taste, which is to its advantage, we should\r\nsay; for having no assistant in the shape of beak or limbs to divide\r\nits prey, hair, fur, feathers, dust—all must be swallowed with the\r\nmeal, completely disguising whatever flesh they cover, so that we\r\nshould suppose the process of feeding could be productive of very\r\nlittle enjoyment to the reptile. Perhaps out of this state of things\r\nhas developed their habit of eating so seldom, but when they do take\r\nthe trouble of feeding, of doing it thoroughly, so that their meal\r\nlasts them a long while.\r\n\r\nDeglutition is greatly facilitated by an abundant supply of saliva,\r\nwhich lubricates that uncomfortable coating of feathers or fur; but\r\n‘lubrication’ is understood to refer merely to the natural secretions\r\nof the mouth, in which the tongue performs no part at all.\r\n\r\nThe salivary apparatus of snakes is peculiar to them, and very\r\ncomplicated. Even the nasal and lachrymal glands pour their superfluous\r\nsecretions through small canals into the mouth.[4] These active and\r\nabundant glands are excited by hunger or the sight of food, just as in\r\nmammals; and for the more common expression of the mouth ‘watering’\r\nthat of ‘lubrication’ is here used, because over the rough-coated\r\nprey these salivary secretions act as a great aid in deglutition. The\r\nerroneous impressions that have obtained on this subject are touched\r\nupon in describing the tongue (chap. vi.).\r\n\r\nA circumstance happened at the London Zoological Gardens a few years\r\nago, which, although familiar to many, may be referred to as bearing\r\non two of the above features—namely, the dull sense of taste in a\r\nsnake, and the abundant supply of mucous secretions. It was in the case\r\nof a large boa which swallowed her blanket. She was about to change\r\nher skin, and, as usual on such occasions, was partially blind, as\r\nalso indifferent to food. The rabbits given to her dodged her grasp,\r\nand her appreciation of flavours was not sufficient to enable her to\r\ndiscriminate between blanket and rabbit fur; so, seizing a portion of\r\nthe rug, she with natural instinct constricted this, and proceeded to\r\nswallow it. She was, however, made to disgorge it afterwards, when it\r\nwas scarcely recognisable from the thick and abundant coating of mucous\r\nin which it was enveloped. Mr. F. Buckland described its appearance as\r\nthat of a ‘long flannel sausage.’\r\n\r\nThese highly-developed salivary glands are beneficent provisions in\r\nthe economy of the serpent race. The reptile cannot, as we said, tear\r\nflesh from bones, and discard the latter; nor separate the food from\r\nthe enveloping feathers or fur; nor reject whatever unsavoury portions\r\nother animals might detach and leave uneaten. All must be swallowed by\r\na snake, and all digested; and its digestion, sufficiently powerful, is\r\naided by the excessive flow of saliva, or the insalivation of such food.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to make snakes disgorge their food. They often\r\ndo so on their own account, when, after swallowing some bulky meal,\r\nthey are alarmed or pursued, and escape is less easy with that load to\r\ncarry. The illustration exhibiting the numerous ribs, which are all\r\nloosely articulated with the spinal column, enables us to comprehend\r\nthe capacity for bulk, and the ease with which these fine ribs would\r\nexpand to accommodate a body even broader than the snake itself. We\r\ncomprehend, also, why it is that a creature swallowed alive need not\r\nbe injured or wounded by the mere fact of being swallowed, but would\r\ndie of suffocation after all. A frog has been known to turn round and\r\nescape from the body of the snake, if the latter indulge in a prolonged\r\nyawn; and yawning almost always does follow as soon as the prey is\r\nswallowed, because the snake has for the time breathed less regularly,\r\nand now requires to take in a fresh supply of air. In this act you see\r\nthe two jaws extended to an enormous degree, almost, indeed, to form\r\none straight line perpendicularly. In such condition the teeth are well\r\nout of the way, and the adjustable ribs, expansile covering, and loose\r\nhead bones render them not insurmountable obstacles to an escape when\r\nthe prey is uninjured.\r\n\r\nOne sometimes hears of the egg-stealing snakes, cobras, etc., when\r\nsurprised and pursued, first relieving themselves of their plunder\r\nbefore they attempt to escape. Often it may be observed, when two\r\nsnakes are in a cage together, and both get hold of the same frog\r\nor rat, that they each advance upon it till their heads meet, when\r\neither the stronger or the larger snake will gain the day, and\r\nfinish his frog, and then proceed to swallow his friend; or else\r\none will relinquish his hold, when, even in those few minutes, the\r\nhalf-swallowed prey will be completely disguised in the mucous saliva\r\nwhich has already enveloped it.\r\n\r\nSome snakes, though not quarrelsome at other times, for some reason\r\ninexplicable to the looker-on, persistently set their heart on the same\r\nbird or frog, though many are presented for their choice. In a pair\r\nof _Tropidonoti_ at the Gardens this occurs almost every week; and in\r\nsuch instances the keeper keeps a sharp watch over them; for as neither\r\nsnake will relinquish its capture, the one that begins first comes in\r\ncontact with the head of his comrade, who will assuredly be swallowed\r\ntoo, were not a little moral, or rather physical coercion in the shape\r\nof a good shaking administered. Sometimes both get their ears boxed,\r\nfiguratively; yet the discipline has no more than a passing effect,\r\nand next week the same thing happens again.\r\n\r\nNot many months ago a very valuable snake was thus rescued literally\r\nfrom the jaws of death. A South American rat snake (_Geoptyas\r\ncollaris_) began to eat a rabbit that was put in the cage for a python,\r\nwhich also began to eat it. _Collaris_ would not let it go, and so the\r\npython continued to advance upon it until he came to his comrade, and\r\nproceeded with this prolonged repast. _Collaris_ is a rather large\r\nsnake of some eight or ten feet long. When nearly the whole of him had\r\nvanished, the keeper—who, of course, had been occupied at each cage in\r\nturn—fortunately discovered about a foot of tail fast disappearing in\r\nthe mouth of the python, the whole of _Collaris_, excepting this caudal\r\nportion, having been swallowed. Just in time to rescue the victim,\r\nthe keeper, by his experienced manipulation, made the python open his\r\nmouth, while the assistant helped to pull at _Collaris_. At last they\r\npulled back all the seven feet of snake, which sustained no further\r\ninjury than a slight scratch or two against the python’s teeth; but he\r\nseemed none the worse, and was no sooner free than he seized a rat,\r\nconstricted and ate it with a celerity which seemed to say he would\r\nmake sure of a meal this time.\r\n\r\nOn the following Friday the very same thing was about to occur again.\r\n_Collaris_ had begun to swallow the python’s rabbit, the latter having\r\nprior hold; but the keeper was on the watch, and administered a little\r\npractical reproof which made the rat snake loosen his hold. Matters\r\nwere further complicated on this occasion by the python throwing some\r\ncoils around his intended feast, so that to get a purchase and manage\r\nthese two constrictors was less easy than on the previous occasion,\r\nthough then the snake had been swallowed. In the same cage were also\r\ntwo other pythons, quite strong enough to strangle a person had\r\nthey taken a fancy to hug him round the neck. Both were aroused and\r\ndispleased at the commotion, and ready to ‘fly’ at the men, who, on the\r\nwhole, had an exciting time with the four constrictors, all from eight\r\nto twelve feet long.\r\n\r\nCannibalism is very common in snakes, particularly among the _Elapidæ_,\r\nwhich have small and narrow heads, and can therefore more conveniently\r\nswallow a fellow-creature than a bird or a quadruped. The keeper told\r\nme that often a box arrives at the Gardens labelled ‘Ten cobras,’\r\nor ‘twelve,’ as may be; when, on opening the box, the number falls\r\nshort; suggesting that cannibalism has diminished the company. It is\r\na curious fact, however, that snakes, as a rule, seize prey whose\r\nbulk far exceeds their own, even when a more manageable kind could be\r\neasily caught. It is as if they were aware of the accommodating nature\r\nof their multifold ribs; as a snake longer than themselves must be\r\ndoubled up in their stomach, and those broader than themselves must,\r\none would imagine, be a most uncomfortable meal to dispose of. Yet this\r\nis common. Mr. H. W. Bates found in a jarraraca an amphisbœna larger\r\nthan itself, and in another snake a lizard whose bulk exceeded its own.\r\nMy Brazilian correspondent, Dr. Arthur Stradling, wrote me of a similar\r\ncircumstance. He received a little _Elaps lemniscatus_ in Maceio, which\r\npresented a singularly bloated appearance. It no doubt felt itself\r\nin a condition not favourable to rapid escape; or captivity impaired\r\nits digestion, for ‘the next morning it disgorged an amphisbœna or\r\nsmall serpent (it was half digested) actually longer than itself, and\r\nweighing half as much again.’\r\n\r\nProdigious meals engender drowsiness, and thus the Ophidia habitually\r\nrepose a long while after taking food.\r\n\r\nThis habit of gorging enormous prey being one of the most striking\r\nof ophidian characteristics, it has been introduced thus early in my\r\nwork, as affording opportunity for a general glance at the anatomical\r\nstructure. In the next chapter we will enumerate a few other peculiar\r\nfeatures, ere proceeding to examine in detail some of the most\r\nimportant organs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_SNAKES OF FICTION AND OF FACT._\r\n\r\n\r\nIN a celebrated lecture on ‘Snakes,’ given by Mr. Ruskin at the London\r\nInstitution in March 1880, he introduced his subject with the three\r\nconsiderations: ‘What has been thought about them?’ ‘What is truly\r\nknown about them?’—extremely little, as he suggested;—and, ‘What is\r\nwisely asked about them, and what is desirable to know?’\r\n\r\nThe three questions exactly agree with the object of my work, this\r\nchapter especially; and I will invite my readers to seek in their own\r\nminds the answer to the first question, which will also furnish a\r\nsolution to the second, and, I trust, incite some interest in the third.\r\n\r\nThe learned lecturer carried us through the realms of fancy, to conjure\r\nup all the grotesque creatures which, under the name of ‘serpents,’\r\nhave figured in heraldry and mythology. By these, and by the light\r\nof the poets of old, and in later times through the naturalists of\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, we learn what a ‘serpent’\r\nwas to them, and what it included. In remote antiquity it was an\r\nembodiment of the hideous and the terrible; and in spite of Aristotle\r\n(a comparatively recent authority), dragons and such-like chimærical\r\ncreatures have pervaded the mind both of the erudite and the ignorant,\r\nin association with serpents, till within three hundred years, and are\r\nnot even yet altogether discarded.\r\n\r\nNor am I inclined to believe that the terror-inspiring representations\r\nof classic days are so unreal as might be supposed. Palæontology is\r\ncontinually bringing to light new evidences of the presence of man\r\non the earth in ages far remote; and we do not know for certain what\r\nstrange forms of animal life were his contemporaries, or when the\r\nfaculty of speech was so far developed in him as to enable him to learn\r\nabout his predecessors, which were still more terrible. We do know that\r\nfossils of mammoth creatures, passing strange, are coeval with fossil\r\nhuman remains, and to those early types of humanity a knowledge of\r\nstill stranger creatures of reptilian forms may have been handed down\r\nfrom mouth to mouth; for there is generally a germ of truth at the root\r\nof a myth. Fossil remains tell us of the gigantic forms of ancient\r\nreptiles, or compound reptile-fish or reptile-birds, and quadrupeds\r\nwhich have gradually diminished in size or become altogether extinct as\r\nour own period has been approached.\r\n\r\nSaid Professor Huxley, at the British Association in 1878, ‘Within the\r\nlast twenty years we have an astonishing accumulation of evidence of\r\nthe existence of man in ages antecedent to those of which we have any\r\nhistorical record. Beyond all question, man, and what is more to the\r\npurpose, intelligent man, existed at a time when the whole physical\r\nconformation of the country was totally different from that which now\r\ncharacterizes it.’\r\n\r\nDid these intelligent beings know anything of the _Dinotherium_\r\n(dreadful beast), or the _Dinornis_ (dreadful bird), or any other of\r\nthose fearful forms which have furnished historic ages with a dragon?\r\n\r\nComing down to our own era, and the time when travel and education\r\nfirst induced the observation and study of animals with a view to learn\r\ntheir habits, and to arrange them under some system of classification,\r\nwe begin to see the perplexities that presented themselves to\r\nnaturalists, especially with regard to egg-producing creatures. To\r\nTopsell, a writer of the seventeenth century, every creeping or\r\ncrawling thing was ‘a Serpente,’ and many insects were included in his\r\ncategory. To Lawson, on the contrary, every egg-producing creature, if\r\nnot a bird, was an ‘Insect.’ In his _History of Carolina_, 1709, he\r\ndescribes, under ‘Insects of Carolina,’ all the snakes he saw, also\r\nthe alligators, lizards, etc., and thus continues: ‘The Reptiles or\r\nsmaller Insects are too numerous to relate here, the Country affording\r\ninnumerable quantities thereof; as the Flying Stags with Horns,\r\nBeetles, Butterflies, Grasshoppers, Locusts, and several hundred of\r\nuncouth Shapes.’ Having thus gone through the ‘Insects,’ except the\r\n‘Eel-snake’ (which turns out to be a ‘Loach’ or _leech_), he gets\r\npuzzled over a ‘Tortois, vulgarly called Turtle, which I have ranked\r\namong the Insects, because they lay Eggs, and I did not know well\r\nwhere to put them.’ And Lawson was not alone in not knowing ‘where to\r\nput’ a countless number of other creatures that go to form the endless\r\nlinks in the long chain of living organisms; even plants, which, to\r\nuse Darwin’s words, ‘with animals, though most remote in the scale of\r\nnature, are bound together by a web of complex relations.’ You may\r\nplace the dove at one end of the chain and the crocodile at the other,\r\nwithout one broken link. The earliest bird which palæontology has\r\nrevealed had teeth in its bill, claws on the end of its wings, and a\r\nlong tail with feathers growing out of it, like a pinnate leaf.\r\n\r\nWe see those strange forms reproduced in the gardens of the Crystal\r\nPalace. Lizards with the head of a bird and other combinations, the\r\nPterosauria or winged-lizards, Ichthyosauria or fish-lizards, of which\r\nsome representative types still exist in the African _Lepidosiren_\r\nand the Mexican _Axolotl_, which have puzzled modern physiologists as\r\nmuch as the Carolina tortoise puzzled Lawson; for whether to call them\r\nreptiles or fishes was long a disputed question. Dr. Carpenter, in his\r\n_Zoology_, reckons fifty-eight of such links among reptiles; as, for\r\ninstance, the transition from turtles to crocodiles, from tortoises\r\nto lizards, in which latter we find the legs growing shorter, till\r\nthey are gone altogether in the blindworms and amphisbænas. These\r\nagain branch off to the cecilias, and the cecilias to worms on one\r\nside, and to frogs on the other, having the form of a snake, but the\r\nskin of the batrachian. There are the Ophiosaurians, snake-lizards,\r\nand Saurophidians, lizard-snakes; there are lizard-like frogs and\r\nfrog-like lizards; some of them beginning life with gills, and becoming\r\nair-breathers afterwards, others of saurian aspect retaining their\r\ngills through life; and from these, again, is the transition between\r\nreptiles and fishes. There are diminutive snakes of worm-like aspect,\r\nand gigantic worms which might be mistaken for snakes; and among modern\r\nnaturalists, that is to say within one hundred years, worms have been\r\nclassed with reptiles when none such enormous species as those lately\r\nfound in Africa were dreamed of.\r\n\r\nThere is in no branch of zoology so much confusion as in herpetology;\r\nand if the reader will, with a sweep of the imagination, embrace the\r\ninnumerable forms that come under the class _Reptilia_, their various\r\ncoverings, and their close gradations, he will not wonder at this. Let\r\nus glance at a few of the systems adopted by Linnæus and others of his\r\ntime, who, we must remember, had to combat not only inherited ideas\r\nof ‘creeping things,’ but the difficulties presented by badly stuffed\r\nor bottled specimens; the latter often having been so long in alcohol\r\nthat their colours had flown, or their covering changed in texture. The\r\nAtlantic was not crossed in a week in those days; and three months,\r\ninstead of three weeks, barely sufficed to reach India, to say nothing\r\nof inland journeys when you got there. If foreign specimens came home\r\nafter the manipulations of a taxidermist, he had done his very best to\r\nrender them as hideous as tradition painted them. Sometimes a wooden\r\nhead on a stuffed body; teeth that might furnish the jaws of the\r\nlargest felines, and a tongue to match; while with external cleansings,\r\nscrapings, and polishings, it were hard to discover what manner of skin\r\nhad originally clothed the creature.\r\n\r\nCarefully chosen was Aristotle’s name for reptiles, ‘the terrestrial,\r\noviparous, sanguineous animals;’ for those which we are considering,\r\nbreathe by lungs, and are therefore red-blooded. Cuvier divided the\r\negg-producing animals into oviparous quadrupeds (lizards, turtles,\r\ncrocodiles, and frogs); bipeds, the birds; insects and serpents.\r\nLinnæus—who, by the way, preceded Cuvier—called all reptiles\r\n‘amphibious animals,’ of which serpents were the second order, those\r\n‘without limbs.’ He also divided them into orders, genera, and species;\r\nbut in the Ophidia was guided too much by the scales, which has caused\r\nconfusion ever since, as both poisonous and harmless snakes often\r\npresent similar characters in this respect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf the reader will turn to the illustration of scales (p. 193), he will\r\nsee an example of the large scutæ or ventral plates that are possessed\r\nby the majority of the true Ophidia. The burrowing snakes, most of\r\nthem small and allied to lizards in their structure, are protected by\r\na cuirass of hard, close-set, polished scales, _alike all round_; or\r\nelse with a thick, smooth skin arranged in rings. Some very poisonous\r\nserpents, notably the sea-snakes, have also the scales alike all round,\r\nbecause they do not require the hold which those large ventral scales\r\nafford to land serpents in progression; but it will at once be seen\r\nthat on so slight a resemblance it would be unsuitable to arrange such\r\nwidely-differing families in the same group. The majority of snakes\r\nhave the scales under the tail different from those under the body;\r\nand a very large number, both of venomous and innocuous snakes, have\r\nbroad ventral scales, as far as the termination of the body, and then a\r\ndouble row where the tail commences. The accompanying illustration is\r\nsufficient to convey a general idea of the arrangement of the scales\r\nbefore and after the anus.\r\n\r\nLinnæus called all serpents with these two rows of sub-caudal scales,\r\n_Colubers_, including under this name many both large and small,\r\nland and water, poisonous and harmless snakes. In respect for the\r\ngreat talent and vast work accomplished by this eminent naturalist,\r\nas well as his then paramount and diffusive knowledge, his systems\r\nprevailed for a very long while. Cuvier, after Linnæus, became also a\r\ngreat authority for a time. He recognised distinctions in the fangs\r\nof venomous snakes, and would reform some previous errors regarding\r\nscales. ‘_Boa_ comprenaient autrefois tous les serpens venimeux ou\r\nnon, dont le dessous du corps et de la queue est garni de bandes d’une\r\nseul pièce.’[5] It was equally unsuitable to mingle those with the\r\ndouble rows, as it put a viper and a coluber together. Cuvier also\r\nmade closer distinctions between the lizard-like snakes and the true\r\nOphidia, ‘_serpens proprement dit_.’ The words _herpetology_ (from the\r\nGreek), and _serpents_ (from the Latin _serpo_), formerly embraced a\r\nmuch larger variety; the former may include _all_ reptiles, while the\r\nmore recently adopted one of _ophiology_ comprises snakes only. And the\r\nhistory of the word tells of the history of the distinctions gradually\r\nadopted as above described, as the true snakes or serpents, without\r\nexternal limbs, were separated from the rest.\r\n\r\nThe various names for a snake—Anguis, Serpens, Coluber, etc.—having\r\nbeen made generic distinctions by some of the older naturalists, cause\r\nconsiderable puzzle to the student, who finds these words applied\r\nalike to many varying species in as many books, because a writer has\r\noften taken one author for his guide, instead of comparing a number.\r\nMany modern writers on ophiology give us a list of synonymes, which\r\nin time are found to unravel the above perplexities, but which are at\r\nfirst more puzzling than not, because a single snake is presented to\r\nyou under so many different names. This will be apparent in the course\r\nof this work, wherein much that is merely suggestive in the present\r\nchapter will be treated more fully under various headings, without, I\r\ntrust, offering a too wearisome repetition. Indeed, the whole study of\r\nthe Ophidia presents so many exceptions that recapitulations may be\r\nacceptable rather than otherwise. An interlacing of subjects has not\r\nhere been avoided so much as contrived, in the hope of presenting the\r\nwhole more clearly to the mind of the student.\r\n\r\nRuskin favoured his audience with printed lists of the ‘names of the\r\nsnake tribe in the great languages.’ And these I gladly reproduce for\r\nthe benefit of my readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘NAMES OF THE SNAKE TRIBE IN THE GREAT LANGUAGES.’\r\n\r\n 1. Ophis (Greek), ‘the seeing’ (creature, understood). Meaning\r\n especially one that sees all round it.\r\n\r\n 2. Dracon (Greek), Drachen (German), ‘the beholding.’ Meaning one that\r\n looks well into a thing, or person.\r\n\r\n 3. Anguis (Latin), ‘the strangling.’\r\n\r\n 4. Serpens (Latin), ‘the winding.’\r\n\r\n 5. Coluber (Latin), Couleuvre (French), ‘the coiling.’\r\n\r\n 6. Adder (Saxon), ‘the grovelling.’\r\n\r\n 7. Snake (Saxon), Schlange (German), ‘the crawling’ (with sense of\r\n dragging, and of smoothness).\r\n\r\nThe first, and _Ophidion_, a small serpent, _Ophiodes_, etc., have\r\ngiven the name _Ophiology_ to the science; the second was also a\r\n‘serpente’ in days of yore. The third, _Anguis_, is now applied to some\r\nof the smooth, burrowing snakes; and the rest speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nBefore quite taking leave of obsolete teachings, a few lines from\r\ntwo very distinguished authors of the seventeenth century must be\r\nquoted, the influence of both having no doubt gone a great way towards\r\ndiffusing beliefs. Lord Bacon—in his book, _Of the Proficience and\r\nAduancement of Learning, Diuine and Humane_. To the King. 1605—writes,\r\n‘It is not possible to join Serpentine Wisdom with the Columbine\r\nInnocency, except men know exactly all the conditions of the Serpent;\r\nhis Baseness and going upon his Belly, his Volubility and Lubricity,\r\nhis Envy and Sting; for without this, Virtue lyeth unfenced.’\r\n\r\nWhat quality is to be understood by ‘Volubility,’ the reader must\r\ndecide. Of the other five offences, all except that of crawling are\r\nsimply imaginary. By ‘Lubricity,’ a supposed sliminess may be intended,\r\nor the old fable of ‘licking’ the prey; and the only reasonable\r\ninterpretation of the ‘Sting’ is that the old Saxon word _styng_ did\r\nimply a wound punctured or pierced with any fine, sharp instrument; and\r\nthe venomous tooth is not so very unlike an insect’s sting after all.\r\n\r\nThe next is from _Pepys’ Diary_, vol. i. p. 322.—Feb. 4th,\r\n1661:—‘Mr. Templer, an ingenious Man, discoursing of the Nature of\r\nSerpents, told us that some in the waste Places of Lincolnshire do grow\r\nto a Great Bigness, and do feed upon Larkes which they take thus:—They\r\nobserve when the Larke is soared to the Highest, and do crawl till they\r\ncome to be just underneath them, and there they place themselves with\r\ntheir mouth uppermost; and there, as it is conceived, they do eject\r\nPoyson upon the Bird; for the Bird do suddenly come down again in its\r\ncourse of a Circle, and falls directly into the Mouth of the Snake.’\r\n\r\nThis story, founded on fact, is related by a beholder who, to use the\r\nwords of Dr. Andrew Wilson when discoursing on ‘Zoological Myths,’ made\r\n‘an unscientific use of his imagination.’ Our largest English snake has\r\nno poison to ‘eject, as it was conceived.’ Quite possible that it might\r\nhave looked up towards the singing lark, and with the swiftness of the\r\nbird in its descent, glided towards the spot, ready to pounce upon it.\r\nThe absurdity of poison being ejected upwards through a needle-like\r\nfang,—had the snake possessed such an instrument,—and to such a\r\nheight, is evident.\r\n\r\nHaving reduced a very large circle of anomalous reptiles, till the\r\nOphidia only are in possession of the enclosure, let me endeavour\r\nto dispose of these according to the present accepted methods—not\r\nof classification, or this volume would be mere lists of names. In\r\n1858, when Dr. Günther arranged and classified the collection in\r\nthe British Museum, there were 3100 colubrine snakes (those with no\r\nviperine features); and when you think of these three thousand odd\r\nhaving, on an average, a dozen names each (the reason for which is\r\ndeferred till the later chapters), my readers will cheerfully dispense\r\nwith much in the way of classes and orders, especially as the present\r\nmethods are reckoned very defective, and there is a loud cry for a new\r\nclassification of the _Reptilia_. Already the reader can surmise some\r\nof the difficulties, and they will be more evident as we proceed.\r\n\r\nThe whole order of Ophidia may be divided into the venomous and the\r\nnon-venomous, or into other two divisions, viz. those which approach\r\nthe Saurians, having scales alike all round, vestiges of shoulder bones\r\nand hind limbs, and with ribs nearly encircling the body; and those\r\nwhich have the broad ventral plates, no rudimentary limbs, and a tongue\r\nfar more extensible than the previous group.\r\n\r\nIt will not, I trust, be out of place to introduce a table as presented\r\nto us at some of the ‘Davis Lectures’ at the London Zoological Gardens;\r\nfor I think I am safe in saying this arrangement is adopted by nearly\r\nall our living authorities. To go back to the days of our childhood\r\nand the game of ‘Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral?’—the original three\r\nkingdoms of Nature,—the first heads our table: ANIMAL KINGDOM. Next\r\ncomes the sub-kingdom, comprising five divisions, namely mammals,\r\nbirds, reptiles, frogs, and fishes, each of which is divided into\r\nclass, order, family, genus, species, with sometimes a sub-class or\r\na sub-order. Professor St. George Mivart divides the whole of the\r\nreptiles into—(1) _Chelonia_, the tortoises; (2) _Ophidia_, the\r\nsnakes; (3) _Crocodilia_, or _Loricata_, the crocodiles; (4) _Sauria_,\r\nthe lizards. _Batrachia_, the frogs, he separates, because they begin\r\nlife as a fish. Originally there were nine orders of reptiles; then\r\nfor a long while we were taught that there were four,—Chelonians,\r\nOphidians, Saurians, and Batrachians. Every one of the above so merges\r\ninto the others that many herpetologists differ in drawing the lines\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nIf we were asked to define our little friend, the ring snake, that ate\r\na frog while we were studying his anatomy, we would say that he belongs\r\nto the—\r\n\r\n  1. ANIMAL KINGDOM.\r\n  2. SUB-KINGDOM, _Vertebrata_.\r\n  3. CLASS, _Reptilia_.\r\n  4. ORDER, _Ophidia_.\r\n  5. FAMILY, _Tropidonotus_.\r\n  6. GENUS, _Coluber_.\r\n  7. SPECIES, _Natrix_.\r\n\r\nHe is most frequently known as _Coluber natrix_, though as both words\r\nmean simply a snake, the name is inadequate. In fact, our common\r\nEnglish snake has been rather neglected in the way of titles, the\r\nonly generic name which is at all descriptive being _Tropidonotus_,\r\nso called from the keel which characterizes the scales. So he is\r\n_Tropidonotus natrix_, and _Natrix tropidonotus_, and _Natrix torquata_\r\nof the different authors, the last-named specific presumably given on\r\naccount of the collar which he wears, and which being often yellow,\r\nhas gained for him the name of ‘ring snake.’ _Coluber natrix_, having\r\nso few synonymes, they are all given, in illustration of what has\r\nbeen already said of the perplexity of names assigned by different\r\nnaturalists. And, by the way, this ‘ring’ or ‘collar’ is not an\r\ninvariable mark. Sometimes the yellow is wanting altogether, and only\r\na white collar is displayed. At the time of writing[6] there is one\r\nof these snakes at the Zoological Gardens with not the least tint of\r\nyellow on its neck; and I have before me in alcohol a very young and\r\nbeautiful little specimen in which the white collar is very bright\r\nand large, and set off with deep black behind it, but there is not an\r\napproach to yellow or to a ring, the throat being pure white. His Latin\r\nspecific is therefore more appropriate than his English one, the collar\r\nbeing always there, but not always the ring.\r\n\r\nDr. Günther divides the whole of the Ophidia into five groups, and in\r\nbriefly describing these I shall hope to conduct my readers towards\r\na consideration of those remarkable features which will be discussed\r\nunder their various heads, and which will exhibit the class as unique\r\nin their marvellous organization and physical powers.\r\n\r\nThe five groups are—\r\n\r\n  1. BURROWING SNAKES.\r\n  2. GROUND SNAKES.\r\n  3. TREE SNAKES.\r\n  4. FRESH-WATER SNAKES.\r\n  5. SEA SNAKES.\r\n\r\n(1) The _Burrowing Snakes_ live chiefly underground, some of them\r\nworking their way down like the worms; and to fit them for this life\r\nthey are characterized by having short stiff bodies covered with hard,\r\nfirm, close scales, to form an armour. Most of them have short and\r\nrather curious tails, as described in chap. xi.; but many that burrow\r\nand hide in the ground live a good deal on the surface as well. Our\r\nlittle native slow-worm (_Anguis fragilis_) is allied to these. Their\r\nheads are small and narrow, their muzzle smooth and strong to help them\r\nto work their way. Their jaws do not stretch apart, nor does their head\r\nget out of shape in eating, the bones being all more consolidated;\r\nand their food being chiefly insects, slugs, worms, etc., they seize\r\nupon these, and hold them, and then with quick snaps get them down\r\ntheir throats. Many of them have rudiments of a sternum, and pelvic\r\nbones—_vestiges_, perhaps, is a more correct term, as we shall find\r\nby and by, for their saurian ancestors had perfect limbs. The group is\r\nlarge, perfectly harmless, and has representatives in most countries\r\nwhere a snake or a lizard is to be found. None are of great size.\r\n\r\n(2) The _Ground Snakes_ include by far the greatest number and\r\ndiversity, and though passing their time chiefly on the surface like\r\nour ‘ring-snake,’ can both climb trees and enjoy the water. Some of the\r\nmost venomous as well as the harmless and gentle kinds, and some of the\r\nlargest as well as the smallest, live habitually on the ground. To fit\r\nthem for progression, they have the broad ventral scales described on\r\np. 46, wide dilatable jaws like _Coluber natrix_, and scales of various\r\npatterns and colourings. Vipers, the cobras, the coronellas, the boas,\r\nmoccasins, ‘carpet snakes,’ and other familiar names belong to this\r\nlarge group.\r\n\r\n(3) _Tree Snakes_ include both venomous and innocent genera. They are\r\nnone of them large, many of them of a brilliant green, and some of them\r\nexquisitely beautiful. Slender and active, the harmless kinds skim\r\namong the branches, which scarcely bend beneath their weight. Many of\r\nthem have small and peculiarly arranged ventral shields, not requiring\r\nto hold on in progression; many also have long prehensile tails, which\r\nwind and cling while the little acrobats swing to and fro, or hang down\r\nto take a young bird or an egg out of the nest. The poisonous kinds\r\nof tree snakes abound in India, have a thick body, broad head, and a\r\ndull, sluggish habit, but still are handsome as to colour, and mostly\r\ngreen. They hide in the trunks of trees, or in the hollow forks of the\r\nbranches, and rarely venture upon the ground. Some, however, live only\r\nin bushy foliage lower down, while other arboreal species frequent the\r\nhighest branches, where, moving with amazing celerity, they are as much\r\nat home as the feathered inhabitants.\r\n\r\n(4) _Fresh-Water Snakes_ are especially adapted for an aquatic\r\nexistence, and have their nostrils on the top of the snout, to enable\r\nthem to breathe easily when in the water. Some of them can hold on\r\nto weeds or other things by their tails. They swim and dive, and are\r\nas active as eels. None are very large, and all are harmless. But a\r\ngood many of the second group that are poisonous, spend so much of\r\ntheir time in the water that they are known as ‘water vipers,’ ‘water\r\nmoccasins,’ etc., though not truly water snakes.\r\n\r\n(5) _Sea Snakes._—All highly venomous. These, as also the fresh-water\r\nsnakes, are treated fully in chapters xiii. and xiv. The five divisions\r\nassist the student towards grasping an idea of the principal groups,\r\nbut the whole five pass into each other by intermediate forms and\r\nimperceptible degrees.\r\n\r\nSome other general characteristics of the Ophidia are that all\r\nare carnivorous, catching their prey alive; all are oviparous;\r\nand in organization and intelligence they rank between birds and\r\nfishes,—higher than fishes in having lungs, and lower than birds,\r\nwhich are warm-blooded animals. Their heart is so formed as to send\r\nonly a portion of blood to the lungs on each contraction of it;\r\ntheir temperature, therefore, is that of the surrounding atmosphere\r\n(see p. 142). Their normal condition, particularly that of the\r\nvenomous species, is one of lethargic repose and indolence, with a\r\ndisposition to retreat and hide, rather than to obtrude themselves.\r\nOn this account, and also because so many of them are nocturnal in\r\ntheir habits, less has been truly known of serpents than of most\r\nother creatures, prejudice having added to a prevailing indifference\r\nregarding them. The duration of their lives is uncertain, or whether\r\nthey have a stated period of growth. Some naturalists think they grow\r\nall their lives; but this must not be taken literally, or that if a\r\nsmall snake happened to escape dangers, and live a very long while, it\r\nwould acquire the dimensions of a python. Some think that formerly the\r\nconstrictors did attain more formidable proportions than those of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nSnakes have small brains, slight intelligence, and slow sensations,\r\namounting almost to insensibility to pain. They can live a long while\r\nwithout their brains and without their heart; while the latter, if\r\ntaken from the body, will continue its pulsations for a considerable\r\ntime. Also if the head be severed, the body will for a certain time\r\ncontinue to move, coil, and even spring, and the head will try to bite,\r\nand the tongue dart out as in life.\r\n\r\nPersons who dislike snakes continually ask, ‘What is the use of them?’\r\nThat they are not without a use will, I hope, appear in the course of\r\nthis work, were it necessary to preach that _all_ things have their\r\nuse. But in one habit that offended Lord Bacon, viz. of ‘going on\r\ntheir belly,’ lies one of their greatest uses, because that, together\r\nwith their internal conformation and external covering, enables them\r\nto penetrate where no larger carnivorous animal could venture, into\r\ndense and noisome morasses, bogs, jungles, swamps, amid the tangled\r\nvegetation of the tropics, where swarms of the lesser reptiles, on\r\nwhich so many of them feed, would otherwise outbalance the harmony\r\nof nature, die, and produce pestilences. Wondrously and exquisitely\r\nconstructed for their habitat, they are able to exist where the higher\r\nanimals could not; and while they help to clear those inaccessible\r\nplaces of the lesser vermin, they themselves supply food for a number\r\nof the smaller mammalia, which, with many carnivorous birds, devour\r\nvast numbers of young snakes. The hedgehog, weasel, ichneumon, rat,\r\npeccary, badger, hog, goat, and an immense number of birds keep snakes\r\nwithin due limits, while the latter perform their part among the\r\ngrain-devouring and herbivorous lesser creatures. Thus beautifully is\r\nthe balance of nature maintained.\r\n\r\nDr. Kirtland, an eminent naturalist of Ohio, who lived at a time when\r\nthat State was being very rapidly settled, namely, during the early\r\nand middle part of the present century, observed a great increase of\r\ncertain snakes as game birds which fed on them decreased. The latter\r\nwere, of course, in request for the market, and the snakes, the ‘black\r\nsnake’ particularly, having fewer enemies to consume him, flourished\r\naccordingly. It would be worth while to ascertain whether the farmer\r\nin Ohio had reason to rejoice over this redundancy of rat and vermin\r\nconsumers. At the present time, when so much of the land is under\r\ncultivation, snakes have decreased again through human agency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_OPHIDIAN TASTE FOR BIRDS’ EGGS._\r\n\r\n\r\nCAN we correctly say that snakes have a ‘taste’ for eggs? What flavour\r\ncan there be in an egg-shell, and what pleasure or gratification can\r\na snake derive from swallowing a hard, round, tasteless, apparently\r\nodourless, and inconvenient mass like a large egg?\r\n\r\nThat snakes do devour eggs and swallow them whole, though the\r\nfact is often questioned in zoological journals, is well known in\r\ncountries where snakes abound. Therefore, we are led to consider by\r\nwhat extraordinary insight or perception a snake discovers that this\r\nuncompromising solid contains suitable food? Avoiding, as snakes do as\r\na rule, all dead or even motionless food, it is the more surprising\r\nthat eggs should prove an exception. And not merely the small and\r\nsoft-shelled eggs of little birds, that can be got easily into the\r\nmouth and swallowed, but the eggs of poultry and the larger birds,\r\nwhich must in the first place be difficult to grasp, and in the second\r\nplace to which the jaws so wonderfully adjust themselves that the egg\r\npasses down entire into the stomach.\r\n\r\nMany snakes which do not habitually live in trees, will climb them\r\nin search of birds’ eggs; and many others, not so agile in climbing,\r\nconsume vast numbers of eggs from the nests of birds which build upon\r\nthe ground. In countries where snakes are numerous and population\r\nsparse, their depredations in the poultry-yards of secluded residences\r\nare of common occurrence. And it is a noteworthy fact that the crawling\r\nculprits possess an excellent memory for the localities of hens’ nests,\r\nso that when once the eggs have been missing, and the snake’s tracks\r\ndiscovered, the farm-hands well know that the offence will be repeated,\r\nand watch for the thief, to whom no mercy is shown. But between their\r\nvirtues as mousers and their vices as egg-thieves, an American farmer\r\ndoes sometimes hesitate in destroying certain non-venomous snakes, and\r\nmay occasionally feel disposed to save his crops, to the sacrifice of\r\nhis wife’s poultry-yard.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, long a resident in India, informed me that a cobra once\r\ngot through a chink into his hen-house, and ate so many eggs from under\r\na sitting hen, that it could not effect its exit through the same\r\nchink, and so remained half in and half out, where the next morning it\r\nwas discovered in a very surfeited condition. It was immediately killed\r\nand cut open, when, as the eggs were found to be unbroken and still\r\nwarm, the experiment was tried of replacing them under the mother,\r\nwho in due time hatched the brood none the worse for this singular\r\n‘departure’ in their process of incubation.\r\n\r\nIn another poultry-yard a cobra was found coiled in a hen’s nest, from\r\nwhich all the eggs were gone but two. In this case, also, the snake\r\nhad swallowed more than it could conveniently manage, but either alarm,\r\ncapture, or greediness so impaired its digestion that all the eggs were\r\nejected entire!\r\n\r\nA similar incident was recorded in the _Field_ newspaper, in May 1867,\r\nthe editor introducing the narrator as one of undoubted intelligence\r\nand veracity.\r\n\r\nHis gardener informed him that a cobra had attacked a guinea-fowl’s\r\nnest in the compound. He took his gun and repaired immediately to\r\nthe spot, where he saw the cobra making off, followed by a host of\r\nscreaming fowls. The gentleman shot the culprit through the head, and\r\nthen observed a tumour-like swelling, as of an egg recently swallowed.\r\nThe gardener cut the reptile open, and took out the egg safe and sound.\r\nThe gentleman marked the egg, and set it with fourteen others under a\r\nguinea-fowl. In due time the young chick was hatched; and this he also\r\nmarked, in order to observe whether it would grow up a healthy bird,\r\nwhich it did.\r\n\r\nSeveral other well-authenticated instances of this nature might be\r\nrelated; but those who have friends or relatives in India are no doubt\r\nsufficiently familiar with such stories to dispense with them here.\r\n\r\nAware of a cobra’s penchant for eggs, the snake-catchers, or those who\r\npack them for transportation to Europe, sometimes place a supply in the\r\ncages, as convenient food for the snakes during the voyage. The keeper\r\nof the Ophidarium[7] at the London Zoological Gardens frequently finds\r\nhens’ eggs unbroken on opening a case containing the newly-arrived\r\ncobras. How many eggs were originally in the box, and how many had\r\nbeen eaten and digested, or reproduced during the voyage, it would be\r\ninteresting to ascertain if possible.\r\n\r\nSnakes are fastidious feeders and long fasters during confinement.\r\nThose cobras may have fasted during the whole journey, or they may have\r\nswallowed and disgorged the eggs through terror, like their friends\r\nat home. Two things are clear, viz. that the eggs were deposited in\r\nthe cage as a favourite delicacy, and that a hen’s egg is not a too\r\ncumbrous morsel for even the small-headed cobra to manage.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, accustomed to snakes, on hearing of this, regarded the\r\neggs found intact in the box as a proof against their egg-eating\r\npropensities, and pointed to the Ophiophagus which, for lack of his\r\nordinary food one winter, had in vain been tempted with both pigeons’\r\nand hens’ eggs. ‘He won’t eat them, he won’t notice them,’ was the\r\nkeeper’s testimony; but, then, other snakes often decline food, even\r\ntheir habitual and favourite food, when in confinement; and so far as\r\nthe Indian snakes are concerned, their egg-eating habits are confirmed\r\nby many writers, including Sir Joseph Fayrer, who affirms that ‘they\r\nwill eat and swallow the eggs whole.’ ‘Snakes are all carnivorous,\r\nexisting on animals and birds’ eggs,’ he again remarks.[8] ‘Cobras rob\r\nhen-roosts, and swallow the eggs whole.’[9]\r\n\r\nAnd does not the very fact of the eggs being placed in the cages by the\r\nnatives for their food during a journey, show that these latter knew\r\nwhat would be most likely to tempt them?\r\n\r\nThe Indian vernacular of the Ophiophagus is _Sunkerchor_, which means,\r\nas Fayrer tells us, ‘a breaker of shells.’ I have taken some pains to\r\nascertain a more definite reason for this name being assigned to the\r\nOphiophagus, or snake-eater, but without success. Is it because he is\r\nan _exception_ to the rule of eggs being swallowed _whole_, he having\r\nfor his size a particularly small mouth and swallow; and that he, like\r\nhis relatives the cobras, being unwilling to relinquish the dainty,\r\nmanages them clumsily, and breaks the shells? There must be some reason\r\nfor his being known as the ‘shell-breaker.’\r\n\r\nBeing a tree snake, it may be that ‘Sunkerchor,’ the shell-breaker,\r\nattempts the smaller birds’ eggs, which are too tender to be swallowed\r\nwithout fracture.\r\n\r\nThe cobra-worshipping Hindûs on their festivals place eggs for their\r\ngods, that they also may partake of the feast.\r\n\r\nBut examples of egg-eating snakes are not confined to India. America,\r\nthe Cape colonies, and all snake countries are prolific of them.\r\n\r\nMr. P. H. Gosse in Jamaica killed a yellow boa (_Chilobothrus\r\ninornatus_), inside of which he found seven unbroken hen’s eggs. It had\r\nbeen caught in a rat trap.\r\n\r\nCatesby, the early American naturalist, in describing the corn-coloured\r\nsnake, says ‘it is harmless except as a robber of hens’ roosts.’\r\nLawson, the still earlier traveller, in his quaint description of the\r\n‘Racer,’ or ‘black snake’ (_Coluber constrictor_), says:—‘He is an\r\nexcellent Egg Merchant, for he does not suck the Eggs, but swallows\r\nthem whole. He will often swallow all the Eggs from under a Hen that\r\nsits, and coil himself under the Hen in the nest, where sometimes the\r\nHousewife finds him.’ Lawson, also, describes the ‘Egg and Chicken\r\nSnake’ (a doubtful vernacular), ‘so called because it is frequent about\r\nthe Hen-Yard, and eats Eggs and Chickens.’ The early American settlers\r\nguarded their poultry-yards against snakes as vigilantly as against\r\nrats, foxes, and other such predators. As for the ‘black snake,’ though\r\nnon-venomous, all rearers of poultry visit him with vengeance.\r\n\r\nOften in our rambles through the woods in Virginia we saw these snakes,\r\nand the swiftness with which they would vanish through the grass like\r\na flash of steel, proved how well they merited their name of ‘Racer.’\r\nThese are the ‘black snakes’ _par excellence_, in distinction to the\r\nblack water-viper and several other kinds which have more or less black\r\nabout them. Sometimes they lay basking in our path, probably after a\r\nmeal, when they become sleepy and inactive. On one such occasion I had\r\nan excellent opportunity of examining one of them, and of measuring\r\nit. It was exactly six feet long, and in the largest part as thick as\r\na man’s arm. Its scales were beautifully bright, like an armour of\r\nsteel, the white throat and pale under tints completing the resemblance\r\nof polished metal. It was sleeping on a soft carpet of moss and grass\r\nwhich bordered our sandy path, and which showed the Racer to great\r\nadvantage. My young companion, a Virginian boy to whom no sport came\r\namiss, espied it with delight, and ran to pick up a stout stick.\r\nKnowing that it was harmless, and so excellent a mouser, I pleaded for\r\nits life; for in truth the nocturnal visitors in the shape of rats\r\nat our country dwelling were so noisy and numerous, that I regarded\r\nthe Racer as a friend rather to be encouraged and domesticated than\r\nruthlessly slain. Its couch now, in its spring green and freshness,\r\nwas enamelled with the star-like partridge-berry (_Mitchella repens_),\r\ndotted here and there with twin coral berries that had lingered through\r\nthe winter; the bright-leaved, white-flowered winter green (_Chimaphila\r\nmaculata_); the Bluets (_Oldenlandia purpurea_), and other exquisite\r\nlittle flowers too lovely to be crushed and tainted; while a sunbeam\r\nglancing through the trees, and showing up the polished scales of the\r\nunconscious Racer, all seemed eloquent with mercy.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time I had been close enough to touch so large a\r\nsnake; and the whole scene is vividly before me now. Culprit though it\r\nmight be, it was splendid and beautiful; and I entreated Johnny to wait\r\nand wake it up, so that we might watch its actions.\r\n\r\n‘All very fine!’ cried the boy, not yet in his teens, ‘and fourteen\r\nmore eggs gone from the hen-house last night!’\r\n\r\nSo he pounced upon a fallen bough, which he rapidly trimmed to suit\r\nhis purpose, then with one sharp blow across the poor thing’s back,\r\ndisabled it. I think the snake was quite killed by the blows the boy\r\nsubsequently dealt, for I do not remember that it moved at all.\r\n\r\n‘_Now_ you can look at it as much as you please,’ said the juvenile\r\nsportsman as he straightened the reptile out to its full length. Then I\r\nexamined and measured it, and found it was more than two lengths of my\r\nlong-handled parasol. Black creatures with two hands and two legs were\r\nfar more likely to be the egg-stealers than that poor Racer far off in\r\nthe woods.\r\n\r\nThis ‘black snake’ climbs trees with ease, and hangs from a branch to\r\nreach a nest below him. ‘He is the nimblest creature living,’ says an\r\nold writer on Virginia, for he not only has the credit of stealing\r\nhens’ eggs, but he ‘even swallows the eggs of small birds, without\r\nbreaking them,’ which again is a proof of the remarkable control these\r\ncreatures possess of regulating the pressure of their powerful jaws.\r\n\r\nMany of the African snakes climb trees, and also suspend themselves\r\nfrom a branch while reaching into a bird’s nest lower down for the\r\neggs it may contain. Both Livingstone and Dr. Andrew Smith[10] make\r\nparticular mention of some of the egg-eating snakes of South Africa,\r\nthe latter in his general description of ophidians stating that ‘many,\r\nperhaps all snakes, devour eggs when they have an opportunity. A few\r\nfeed entirely on eggs,’ notably some of the small tree snakes, to which\r\nthe name _Oligodon_ (few teeth) has been given, this family having no\r\nteeth on the palate, like all other snakes. Their food, therefore,\r\ncannot be of a nature to require a very strong grasp, though we have no\r\nauthority for stating that the _Oligodons_ feed exclusively on eggs.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one of the family with a dentition so remarkable\r\nthat it has been considered a distinct type, and Dr. Andrew Smith,\r\nwho was the first to observe its habits, gave it the generic name\r\nof _Anodon_ (toothless), the jaws being merely roughened with the\r\nrudiments of teeth. This little snake, of about two feet in length, is\r\nexclusively an egg-feeder. ‘Its business,’ says Professor Owen in his\r\n_Odontography_, ‘is to restrain the undue increase of small birds by\r\ndevouring their eggs.’ Its remarkable organization is favourable for\r\nthe passage of these thin-shelled eggs unbroken until far back in the\r\nthroat or gullet, when the egg comes in contact with certain ‘gular\r\nteeth,’ which then break the shell without any loss of the contents to\r\nthe feeder. These gular teeth are a curious modification of some of\r\nthe spinal processes, presenting a singular anomaly in the presence of\r\npoints of enamel on the extremity of some of them.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen has very fully described this remarkable\r\ndevelopment,[11] and as his works have been the text-books of many\r\nlater physiologists, his words may here be quoted, even at the risk of\r\nrepetition.\r\n\r\n‘In the rough tree snake, _Deirodon scaber_, with 256 vertebræ,\r\na hypapophysis—from ὑπὸ (Latin, _sub_), an offshoot from\r\nbeneath—projects from the 32 anterior ones, which are directed\r\nbackwards in the first ten, and incline forwards in the last ten,\r\nwhere they are unusually long, and tipped with a layer of hard cement\r\n(dentine). These perforate the dorsal parietes of the œsophagus, and\r\nserve as teeth.\r\n\r\n‘Those who are acquainted with the habits and food of this species\r\nhave shown how admirably this apparent defect—viz. the lack of\r\nteeth—is adapted to its well-being. Now, if the teeth had existed\r\nof the ordinary form and proportions in the maxillary and palatal\r\nregions, the egg must have been broken as soon as it was seized, and\r\nmuch of the nutritious contents would have escaped from the lipless\r\nmouth; but owing to the almost edentulous state of the jaws, the\r\negg glides along the expanded mouth unbroken, and not until it has\r\nreached the gullet, and the closed mouth prevents the escape of any\r\nof the nutritious matter, is it exposed to the instruments adapted to\r\nits perforation. These instruments consist of the inferior spinous\r\nprocesses,’ etc., already described. ‘They may be readily seen even in\r\nvery small subjects, in the interior of that tube in which their points\r\nare directed backwards. The shell being sawed open longitudinally by\r\nthese vertebral teeth, the egg is crushed by the contractions of the\r\ngullet, and is carried to the stomach, where the shell is no doubt soon\r\ndissolved by the acid gastric juice.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nPortion of spine of the Deirodon, from Andrew Smith’s\r\n_Zoology of South Africa_.\r\n\r\nGular teeth penetrating into the gullet, _ib._\r\n\r\nPortion of spine from a skeleton at the museum of the R.\r\nC. S., natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe two from Smith’s _Zoology_ must be much magnified; the third, from\r\nthe skeleton, being the true size, excepting that the ribs are broken\r\nshort off, some entirely so. The minute processes extend two or more\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nAs the learned professor has described the _Deirodon_ (neck-toothed)\r\nboth under the head of teeth, and also of vertebrated animals, the two\r\naccounts are blended, but given _verbatim_ as far as possible.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the _Deirodon_ is of a brightish or yellowish brown, very\r\nminutely spotted with white. Such few true teeth as some individuals\r\nmay possess are extremely small and conical, discovered only towards\r\nthe angle of the mouth.\r\n\r\nDr. Andrew Smith first examined a specimen in 1829, when he found that\r\nthe gular teeth commence exactly 2-1/4 inches behind the apex of the\r\nlower jaw, and penetrate the œsophagal canal through small holes in its\r\ntunics, and that each point is armed with enamel. He had observed that\r\nthe living specimens which he had in captivity always, when feeding,\r\nretained the egg stationary about two inches from their head, and while\r\nthere, used great efforts to crush it. Dissecting a specimen in order\r\nto investigate this strange action, he discovered the gular teeth just\r\nwhere the egg had stopped, and which, he felt satisfied, had assisted\r\nin fixing it there, and also in breaking the shell when subjected to\r\nthe muscular action of the surrounding parts. The gular teeth are\r\ndeveloped in very young _Deirodons_.\r\n\r\nDr. Smith saw that the broken shell was ejected, while the fluid\r\ncontents were conveyed onwards; but this may have been an exceptional\r\ncase, because by a snake in health egg-shells are easily digested.\r\nProbably those snakes watched by Dr. A. Smith being captives, and\r\npresumably not altogether as happy and healthy as in their sylvan\r\nhomes, found the shells too much for them, and so ejected them; as\r\nthe cobras above described disgorged the stolen eggs. This habit of\r\ndisgorging food appears to be sometimes voluntary.\r\n\r\nSnakes have been known to pass the egg through their body entire, but\r\nthis also must be owing to an abnormal state of health or of habit, as\r\nthe strong juices of the stomach, which can convert even bones and horn\r\nto nutriment, ordinarily dissolve an egg-shell.\r\n\r\nThroughout nature we find that, whatever the habits of the creature may\r\nbe, its structure and capacities are adapted to it. Every need is, as\r\nit were, anticipated in the process of development; and wherever, as\r\nin this harmless little tree snake, we find a departure from general\r\nrules, it is because some especial requirements are met, and in order\r\nthat the creature may be the better prepared for the struggle for\r\nexistence. In the present example we find a marvellous adaptation of\r\nspine bones to dental purposes; how many ages it has taken to develop\r\nthem we cannot conjecture. All we know is that these spinal projections\r\nare just the sort of teeth that the egg-swallower requires, and that\r\nits natural teeth are gradually becoming obsolete from disuse.\r\n\r\nA writer who was quoted at some length in the _Zoologist_ for 1875, and\r\nin several other contemporary journals, stated that some snakes ‘suck\r\nout the contents of hen’s eggs by making a hole at the end.’[12]\r\n\r\nWe are not told with what instrument these evidently scientific\r\nserpents punctured the shell. Some skill is required, as schoolboys\r\ngive us to understand, to prick an egg-shell without breaking it; and\r\neven when the hole _is_ bored, additional care is required to suck out\r\nthe contents. How a snake could first grasp firmly, and then puncture a\r\nfowl’s egg, is incomprehensible; how the sucking process is achieved\r\nis still more so. We can understand that a snake which discovered a\r\nbroken egg might seem to lap some of the contents, because, as we shall\r\nby and by show, the tongue habitually investigates, and is immediately\r\nin requisition under all circumstances. But to lap up an egg would be a\r\nvery slow process for so slender an instrument. One is reminded of the\r\ndinner which Sir Reynard invited his friend the Stork to partake with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhile still marvelling over these South African egg-suckers, I\r\nwatched some lizards with a broken egg in their cage. Their tongues\r\nwere long, thin, blade-like, and bifid, much better adapted for\r\nthe purpose of lapping than that of a snake, yet stupidly slow and\r\ninefficient was this ribbon-like tongue. The lizards threw it out,\r\nspatula-fashion, into the midst of the pool of egg which was spreading\r\nitself over the floor, and caught whatever of the fluid adhered to it.\r\nHad the lizards possessed lips adapted for such a purpose, and, in\r\naddition, intelligence enough to ‘suck,’ they might have drawn some\r\nof the cohesive mass into their throats, but they only obeyed their\r\ninstinctive habit of lapping. Snakes would do the same. Their habit\r\nis to moisten the tongue in lapping; and I fear we must not place too\r\nmuch credence in the exceptional intelligence of that South African\r\negg-sucker, but rather regret the loose account which conveys so\r\nerroneous an impression. I watched those lizards for many minutes, and\r\ndecided that the egg would be dried up long before it could be consumed\r\nby lizard-lapping.\r\n\r\nThe tongue of a snake is undoubtedly an important and highly-developed\r\norgan. That its sensitiveness assists the smell, we have reason to\r\nbelieve, and possibly it possesses other faculties of which we are at\r\npresent ignorant. In the case of an unbroken egg, for instance, the\r\ntongue has told the snake that there is something good inside it; and\r\ninstinct immediately leads the reptile to get the awkward mouthful\r\nbetween its jaws, which expand just so far as to retain it safely,\r\nyet just so lightly that not one of those rows of long, sharp teeth\r\nshall penetrate the shell or fracture it in the slightest degree. How\r\ndelicate must be the adjustment whereby those six jaws, all bristling\r\nwith fine, needle-like teeth, grasp and yet not break the delicate\r\nshell! for, after all, an egg _is_ a fragile substance in proportion to\r\nthe size of the feeder and its muscular power.\r\n\r\nSnakes have been known to get choked in attempting to swallow an egg,\r\nas they have also come to grief with other impediments, such as horns\r\nof cattle; but this we must attribute to their not being able to\r\nestimate their own swallowing capacities, or to some other untoward\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nThe Messrs. Woodward’s scientific snake would not have crept into\r\nthese pages had it not previously figured in the _Zoologist_, and\r\nthence copied in other prints, thereby misleading many readers. It\r\nalso proved a subject worth discussing by thinking persons, and was\r\nalluded to very particularly by an ophiological friend and publisher\r\nin a letter to myself, which may be here usefully quoted. My friend,\r\nwho has long stimulated me by his kind encouragement of my work, and by\r\nthe assistance of his experience and judgment, was pleased to express\r\nmuch interest in a little paper on the _Deirodon_[13], which I had\r\nwritten for _Aunt Judy’s Magazine_, he having read it shortly before\r\nthe appearance of the Messrs. Woodward’s statement in the _Zoologist_,\r\nApril 1875:—\r\n\r\n‘In this month’s _Zoologist_,’ wrote my friend, ‘a writer says that a\r\ncertain snake makes havoc of the hen-house, by boring a hole in the\r\negg and sucking its contents! Can this be true? To a letter of mine to\r\nMr. Newman (the then editor of the _Zoologist_), on the subject, he\r\nreplies, “With regard to snakes eating eggs, it has been repeated so\r\noften that I cannot help fearing Mr. Woodward may have _imbibed the\r\nnotion from American sources_. It is so common in the United States to\r\nfind snakes in holes in the bottoms of trees made by woodpeckers, that\r\nit seems almost impossible to resist the conviction that they enter\r\nthese holes to get the birds themselves, or their young, or their eggs.\r\nIt must be regretted that those witnesses who come into court with\r\nsuch evidence are not, generally speaking, the kind of close observers\r\nin whose dicta we can place implicit reliance.” This,’ continues my\r\ncorrespondent, ‘Mr. Newman writes after I had suggested that some\r\nfamilies of snakes have triturating powers (learned from _Aunt Judy_)\r\nin the throat, independent altogether of palatal teeth. The subject\r\nseems to be as much steeped in the unknown, as are the ways of the\r\nbeautiful creatures themselves.’\r\n\r\nThis from a well-known and highly-popular publisher, a man of\r\neducation, culture, and scientific attainments, though snakes hitherto\r\nhad not been his specialty, any more than that of the late editor of\r\nthe _Zoologist_. The latter, however, admitting his doubts on the\r\nsubject of ophidian egg-feeders, would have done well to have added\r\na note to that effect to the account given by Mr. Woodward, which,\r\nsimply from its appearance in a scientific journal, might be received\r\nas authority.\r\n\r\nA few more well-known proofs of ophidian taste for eggs may conclude\r\nthis chapter. Of our own green or ring snake (_Coluber natrix_), Mr.\r\nBell says, ‘It feeds upon young birds, _eggs_, and mice, but prefers\r\nfrogs.’ In Balfour’s _India_, on the subject of cobra-worship, mention\r\nis made of the snakes getting into larders for _eggs_ and milk, and\r\nbeing protected as the good genius of the house on such occasions.\r\n\r\nBut the Hindû custom of placing eggs for snakes at their serpent\r\nfestivals must be too familiar to most of my readers to need further\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_DO SNAKES DRINK?_\r\n\r\n\r\nPERHAPS in no other branch of natural history has such a degree of\r\ninterest been awakened during the last decade, and such an advance made\r\nas in ophiology. The result of a spirit of inquiry thus set afloat is\r\nthat information is being continually elicited from travellers and\r\nobservers. Those who now entertain predilections for this branch of\r\nscience, will many of them admit that whatever interest they feel in\r\nthe subject has been of a comparatively recent date; that since they\r\nhave at all studied snake nature, they have repeatedly had to combat\r\nwith preconceived notions. Again and again they have been ‘surprised to\r\nlearn that so-and-so’—some now established fact, perhaps—is the case,\r\nwhen they had ‘_always_ thought’—probably something quite the contrary.\r\n\r\nThis has been frequently verified in my own experience in my\r\ncorrespondence with really scholarly men, who have generously admitted\r\nas much. Not a few, during my ten years’ study of the Ophidia, have\r\ntraced their interest in snakes to my own enthusiasm. Preconceived\r\nerrors are not to be wondered at when we consider that, apart from\r\nscientific works, so much that has been related of serpents has\r\nbeen mingled with prejudice, fable, and tradition, clouding our\r\nintelligence at the very outset. Nor need we hesitate in admitting our\r\nmisconceptions, when we find scientific men themselves devoting page\r\nafter page to a mooted question, and after all, sometimes venturing to\r\nsum up a given subject with a modest doubt only. (Would that the less\r\nscientific writers were equally cautious in their statements!) Whether\r\nsnakes drink, and _what_ they drink, have been among these debated\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThose who possess a love for natural history are, of course, acquainted\r\nwith the works of the eminent naturalist, Dr. Thomas Bell, on our\r\nnative fauna; and those who admit their interest in the much-maligned\r\nsnakes have included in their studies his _British Reptiles_.[14] In\r\none portion of that work, where science is so charmingly blended with\r\npersonal observations, we are carried on to the heaths and commons to\r\nwatch our pretty little agile lizards skim across the grass, and flit\r\naway with legs too fleet for us to follow them.\r\n\r\nWe linger on the banks of a stream where a ring snake lies in wait for\r\na frog; and then we are conducted into Mr. Bell’s study, where the same\r\nharmless creature, now tamed, is nestling in his sleeve, or lapping\r\nmilk from his hand.\r\n\r\nMost of my readers also, whether naturalists or not, are familiar\r\nwith some of the numerous works on India, its creeds, customs, and\r\nsuperstitions, where mention is so frequently made of cobra-worship,\r\nand of the natives setting saucers of milk near its hole to conciliate\r\nand propitiate the serpent. Familiar to us all, too, is the picture of\r\na little child with a bowl of milk on its lap, and a snake receiving\r\na tap with the spoon to check the too greedy intrusion of its head\r\ninto the bowl, but into which, according to the story, it had been\r\naccustomed and permitted to dip its tongue. Some persons place that\r\nstory in Wales; others, and with better reason, trace it to New\r\nEngland. The child and its surroundings, the size of the snake, all\r\njustify this latter belief, and that the intruder is the notorious\r\nmilk-stealer so common in the United States, the ‘black snake,’ or\r\nRacer (introduced p. 64).\r\n\r\nIn the face of these well-known facts, it may seem strange to propose\r\nthe question, ‘Do snakes ever drink?’ and still stranger to affirm that\r\nthis was lately a disputed point among some of our scientific writers.\r\n‘On s’ignore,’ says Schlegel, ‘si les serpents boivent, et s’il est\r\njuste d’opiner pour la negative; toutefois on n’a jamais aperçu des\r\nfluides dans ceux dont on a examiné l’estomac.’[15]\r\n\r\nSchlegel, when he wrote, had not the benefit of Mr. Bell’s experience,\r\nand as a foreigner, probably he had not read Jesse’s _Gleanings_ nor\r\nWhite’s _Selborne_; nor, as a scientific student, had he time to bestow\r\non promiscuous works on India, which, by the way, were not so numerous\r\nthen as now. But there are several well-known milk-drinking snakes\r\nin America which had been described by writers prior to Schlegel.\r\nThis learned author, however, puts down the milk-loving snakes among\r\nthe ‘fables’ and ‘prejudices;’ and, as we have seen, dismissed the\r\nwater-drinkers with a doubt.\r\n\r\nMr. Bell’s work has enjoyed upwards of thirty years’ popularity, and\r\nhis milk-drinking pet has been quoted by scores of writers of both\r\nadult and juvenile books. Thomas Bell, F.L.S., F.G.S., was secretary\r\nto the Royal Society; Professor of Zoology of King’s College, London;\r\nand one of the Council of the Zoological Society of London. He was\r\nalso a ‘corresponding member’ of the learned societies of Paris and\r\nPhiladelphia, and of the Boston Society of Natural History.\r\n\r\nAs a gentleman of widely recognised learning and veracity, therefore,\r\nit may be considered that Mr. Bell, and with good reason, entertained\r\nno doubt whatever as to snakes drinking, and also drinking milk. Mr.\r\nBell, moreover, had known of the celebrated python at Paris (see chap.\r\nxxiv.), which in 1841 evinced a thirstiness that has become historical\r\nin all zoological annals. The circumstance was fully recorded by M.\r\nValenciennes at the time; when a no less distinguished ophiologist\r\nthan M. Dumeril,[16] _Professeur d’Erpétologie au Musée à Paris_,\r\nwas especially appointed to the management of the reptile department\r\nthere. That very distinguished ophidian lady, the python, need be\r\nreferred to here only as regards the drinking question, the rest of her\r\nhistory coming in its place in this book. It will be remembered that\r\nshe laid eggs, and to the surprise of all, coiled herself upon them\r\nto hatch them. ‘Pendant tout le temps d’incubation la femelle n’a pas\r\nvoulu manger’ (she began to incubate on the 6th May); ‘mais le 25^e de\r\nmai, après vingt jours de couvaison, son gardien, Vallée, homme très\r\nsoigneux et très intelligent, la voyant plus inquiète que de coutume,\r\nremeuée la tête, et lui présenta de l’eau dans un petit basin; elle\r\ny plongea le bout de son museau, et l’animal en _but_ avec avidité\r\nenvirons de deux verres. Elle a ensuite bu quatre fois pendant le reste\r\ndu temps de sa couvaison: le 4 juin, 13, 19, 26.’ (Her eggs began to\r\nhatch early in July.)\r\n\r\nThe interesting invalid, ordinarily tame and gentle, had latterly\r\ndisplayed anger and irritability on being disturbed, pushing away\r\nthe hand if touched; but in her present state the want of water was\r\nso great that she evinced uneasiness to her guardian, and permitted\r\nhim to move and turn her head, so that she could dip the end of her\r\nmuzzle into the basin. The narrator argued, from this remarkable\r\ndemonstration, that the incubation (in which a rise of temperature was\r\nobservable) produced a sort of feverishness which caused her to decline\r\nsolid food, though her thirst was so great that she almost asked for\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nWhen eight of the fifteen eggs were hatched, the little pythons ate\r\nnothing until after their first moult (which happened to them all\r\nwithin a fortnight), but during those early days of their existence\r\nthey ‘_drank several times_, and also bathed themselves.’\r\n\r\nThis event perhaps established the fact beyond any doubt that snakes\r\ndo drink, so far as modern and scientific ophiologists had ventured to\r\ndecide; and M. Dumeril, from long observation, is able to tell us how.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the tongue of a snake, this experienced naturalist informs\r\nus that ‘cette langue fort longue sert-elle comme on l’a observée\r\nquelquefois à faire pénétrer un peu de liquide dans la bouche, car nous\r\navons vu nous-même des couleuvres laper ainsi l’eau, que nous avions\r\nplacée auprès d’elles dans la cage, où nous les tenions renfermées\r\npour les observer à loisir.’[17]\r\n\r\nBut, as he goes on to describe, ‘quelques serpents avalent de l’eau\r\nsans se servir de la langue pour laper. Alors ils tiennent la tête\r\nenfoncée sous l’eau au-dessous du niveau, ils écartent un peu les\r\nmâchoires, et font baisser le fond de la gorge, dans laquelle l’eau\r\ndescend par son propres poids.’ You can then perceive the slight\r\nmovements of swallowing, like a thirsty man gulping down a beverage (_à\r\nla régalade_).\r\n\r\nWhat follows affords an explanation of M. Schlegel’s statement that\r\nhe had never discovered water in a snake which he had dissected, this\r\nlearned author not having gone so thoroughly into the matter. ‘Cette\r\neau,’ says M. Dumeril, ‘sert à laver les intestines; car elle est\r\nrendue liquide avec les fèces, elle ne parait pas expulsée par les\r\nvoies urinaires.’\r\n\r\nM. Dumeril speaks very clearly on this point both in his introductory\r\npreface, and again in vol. vi., under the more detailed descriptions of\r\neach especial sense and organ.\r\n\r\nSnakes rarely drink (that is, not every day, as most animals do),\r\nmost of them living in dry regions or forests, where for long periods\r\nthey are deprived of water. The live prey upon which they subsist\r\nsupplies them with sufficient liquid. This may be known by the natural\r\ndischarges, which are usually of a liquid nature. Nevertheless, a large\r\nnumber of serpents live close to water, and love to plunge and to swim.\r\nThese truly drink,—lapping with the tongue, as above described; at\r\nother times with the head under water, and the neck still lower, so\r\nthat the water _falls into the mouth by its own weight_, and is then\r\nswallowed. But this, he repeats, does not go into the blood, or _very\r\nlittle_ of it, _car ils rendent en grand partie_, etc., as above, its\r\nfunction being principally to moisten the intestines.\r\n\r\nLenz, a German ophiologist of still earlier date than Schlegel,\r\nwent very conscientiously into the subject of whether snakes drink\r\nor not,[18] having adopted various means in order to test them. His\r\npersonal experience was, however, of a more limited range.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to bear in mind the dates of some of these writings,\r\nboth that we may watch the gradual advance of ophidian knowledge, and\r\nalso that we may the better appreciate the vast amount of time, care,\r\nlabour, and research by which we are finally put in possession of facts\r\nof natural history.\r\n\r\nAs a comparatively modern writer, Lenz, without doubt, made very\r\nvaluable contributions to the science of ophiology, and at a time when\r\nfact was only beginning to be sifted from fable. It will be seen that,\r\nthough writing several years before Schlegel, he had arrived at the\r\nsame conclusions.\r\n\r\n‘The numerous snakes and other animals which inhabit arid mountains,\r\nor plains destitute of water, can only quench their thirst with rain\r\nor dew. Snakes require but little water as long as they live in the\r\nopen air. It is an established rule that no water is found in the maw,\r\nstomach, or entrails of snakes killed in the open air, even when\r\ndestroyed by or in a piece of water. _Snakes are never seen to go to\r\ndrink in any part of the world._’\r\n\r\nThis last clause is, as we have now seen, a too positive assertion,\r\nand one not subsequently borne out by other equally conscientious and\r\nintelligent writers. Livingstone, who was a close observer of nature,\r\ninforms us that he has known some of the African snakes _come a long\r\nway to pools and rivers to drink_. Dr. Theodore Cantor, who is one of\r\nthe best authorities on the Indian sea snakes, and who was a member\r\nof the Zoological Society, tells us that he has seen snakes ‘both\r\ndrink and also moisten the tongue; _two distinct operations_,’ he\r\nexplains.[19] This conviction having been stated prior to Dumeril’s\r\nelaborate and much-prized work, is valuable testimony. The majority of\r\nsnakes in India are partial to water, he tells us, with the exception\r\nof the arboreal species, which probably obtain sufficient moisture from\r\nthe rain or dew upon the leaves; and as it is not in their nature to be\r\non the ground, their organization doubtless renders them independent of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWe of late so often see it said of any particular snakes in captivity\r\nthat ‘they neither ate nor drank at first;’ or that ‘they drank, though\r\nthey would not eat,’ that we almost wonder their bibulous propensities\r\nwere ever doubted; especially as the majority of snakes are fond of\r\nwater, and swim readily. We are surprised, therefore, that the second\r\nedition of Mr. Lenz’ really valuable work, published so lately as 1870,\r\nshould still retain the assertion that snakes have never been _seen_ to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nMr. Frank Buckland saw his Coronella drink frequently, though she\r\nate nothing; and as the discovery and captivity of this interesting\r\nlady and her brood, born in London in 1862,[20] formed the subject of\r\nmany papers in the scientific journals at the time, one would suppose\r\nthat they would have been heard of in Germany, where the species (_C.\r\nlævis_) is well known.\r\n\r\n‘Though not to be tempted with food, they are very fond of water,’ says\r\nMr. F. Buckland.\r\n\r\nLenz’ experiments are, however, well worth noticing, because subsequent\r\nobservations have in many instances confirmed this author’s conclusions.\r\n\r\n‘In confinement,’ he says, ‘snakes are more easily induced to lick up\r\ndrops sprinkled on grass than to drink from a vessel.’ Naturally so. In\r\ntheir native haunts they are not accustomed to pans of water or saucers\r\nof milk, but they _are_ accustomed to moisten their tongues on the\r\nblades of grass or the leaves of plants which hold the drops of rain\r\nor dew. Lenz then mentions some experiments which he himself made with\r\nsnakes. He placed a ring snake and an adder in an empty box, and kept\r\nthem there without food for a fortnight, at the end of which period he\r\nplaced them in a tub containing half an inch of water, and left them\r\nthere for half an hour. He then killed them both, and on dissection\r\nfound no water inside of them. This led him to the conclusion that\r\nthey had not drank at all; but, in the first place, had they occupied\r\nthe whole half-hour in lapping with their thread-like tongue, it may\r\nbe doubted whether any appreciable quantity could be imbibed during\r\nthat time; and in the second place, the sudden transition and strange\r\nsituation in which they found themselves would, through fright,\r\nentirely destroy whatever inclination they might have had to appease\r\nhunger or thirst.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that snakes are exceedingly capricious in taking food;\r\nand that when in an abnormal or strange locality they rarely feed for\r\na long while. Mr. Lenz himself is of opinion that, had he left them\r\nlonger in the water, or placed them in a dry tub where liquid could\r\nbe got at, they would or might have drunk. Thus, the experiments only\r\ngo to corroborate what all keepers of snakes have observed, viz. that\r\ncaptivity or strange surroundings render them averse to feed.\r\n\r\nM. Lenz placed his snakes among the cows in order to test the foolish\r\nbelief that obtains in some countries that snakes will ‘suck’ the\r\nudders; but of course, and for similar reasons, even could such an\r\nachievement be possible, the snakes attempted no such thing.\r\n\r\nHis snakes were strict members of a temperance society also, for not\r\neven wine could tempt them to drink, though this and other liquids\r\nwere placed within reach to entice their taste. Not so Pliny’s snakes,\r\nfor he would have us believe that they show ‘a great liking for wine,’\r\nwhenever an opportunity presented itself for their tasting it!\r\n\r\nBut how came the idea to obtain that snakes suck cows,—a fact so\r\nfrequently asserted by the older naturalists? One old writer goes so\r\nfar as to state that a certain American snake ‘causes cows to give\r\nforth bloody milk.’ And yet, to the thinking or observing person,\r\nthe origin of the belief may be easily accounted for. That snakes\r\nhave partiality for milk no longer admits of a doubt; that they like\r\nwarmth and shelter is an equally established fact. Therefore, they\r\nfind their way into cattle-sheds, and hide in the straw or any snug\r\ncorner, possibly even among the recumbent cattle; and, being there,\r\ntheir ever busy exploring tongues discover a savour of milk, and the\r\nsnake is led by this intelligent tongue to the very fountain of their\r\nfavourite drop. The irritated cow would then naturally stir or kick,\r\nand endeavour to shake off the strange intruder, who, in its turn\r\nalarmed or angered, would bite the udder, and fetch blood. This, in the\r\ndark ages of natural history, and during the period when the serpent\r\nwas invested with all manner of cruel and revolting wilfulness, would\r\nsuffice to give rise to the belief that has so long prevailed. The\r\nrat snake (_Ptyas mucosus_) and the _Clothonia_ of India are ‘said’\r\nto suck the teats of cows; so also are the ‘hoop snake’ and several\r\nother American species, which, with their climbing propensities, may\r\nsometimes twine themselves about the legs of cattle, and thus reach the\r\nudders, where persons have discovered them. It is just possible that\r\nthe snakes may get the teat into their mouths, and advance upon it,\r\nwith the intention of swallowing it, not knowing that it was only a\r\nteat, with a cow inconveniently attached to it, and not some small and\r\nmore manageable prey.\r\n\r\nAmong the American milk-drinking snakes is _Coluber eximius_, known as\r\nthe ‘milk snake,’ one of the dairy frequenters, which is said to seek\r\nmilk with avidity. This snake is mentioned by De Kay,[21] Emmons,[22]\r\nand Holbrooke,[23] who all describe it as being very beautiful and\r\n‘innocent’ (except in the eyes of the farmers’ wives). It is of a pale,\r\npearly white, sometimes tinged with pink, and with rich chocolate spots\r\non its back. The Racer, of egg-stealing notoriety, is also a sad milk\r\nthief, and, like our own little ring snake, has been known to retrace\r\nits way into dairies. Such depredations were more frequent formerly\r\nwhen the snakes were more numerous. Of the Racer, Lawson[24] says,\r\n‘This Whipster haunts the Dairies of careless Housewives, and never\r\nmisses to skim the Milk clear of the Cream.’\r\n\r\nThe same love of warmth which takes the reptiles among cattle, guides\r\nthem into dwellings, particularly during the night; and in hot\r\ncountries where nursing-women of the poorer classes lie exposed, snakes\r\nhave been found upon their breasts, and absurd stories have been told\r\nof their sucking the teats of women. In India, Australia, and America,\r\nsuch stories are common.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it does not seem surprising that snakes should like milk.\r\nBeing carnivorous by nature, they would at once detect an animal\r\nflavour in the liquid by the agency of their sensitive tongue.\r\n\r\nNow turning to India, we find that the love of snakes for milk is\r\nmentioned by numerous writers on the manners and customs of the Hindûs,\r\nas well as by travellers and naturalists. Balfour[25] tells us ‘when\r\na snake discovers how to get at the eggs and _milk_ in a larder, no\r\nnative will on any account kill it, because it is regarded as the good\r\ngenius of the house.’ And again, ‘that the cobra is fed with _milk_ in\r\nsome of the temples where it is worshipped.’\r\n\r\nDr. Shortt of Madras keeps a man to attend to his cobras, and finds\r\nthey thrive excellently on sour milk, which is administered once in\r\nten or twelve days.[26] ‘Snakes feed on eggs and _milk_,’ says Sir J.\r\nFayrer.\r\n\r\nWhen we read similar facts mentioned incidentally, and with no especial\r\nobject, we may give them credence even more than if a prejudiced writer\r\nwere endeavouring to prove such or such a thing. For instance, during\r\nthe visit of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales to India, the exhibition\r\nof snakes and snake-charming formed a not unimportant item in the\r\nprogramme, and furnished many columns of cobra performances and\r\ncobra traditions to the papers. More than one of the journalists\r\nunintentionally corroborated what Balfour and other writers tell us\r\nabout the ‘good luck’ of having a cobra in the _chuppur_ of the hut,\r\nthe fearlessness with which the children regard their ‘uncle,’ as they\r\ncall it, and their care in placing _milk_ and eggs for it each evening.\r\n\r\nBut I am reminded of a singular case which came to me through a\r\npersonal acquaintance from India who was present at the time.\r\n\r\nFour officers sitting in a bungalow in India were deep in a game of\r\nwhist. Suddenly one of them, turning deadly pale, made signs that no\r\none should move or speak. In a hushed voice he exclaimed, ‘Keep still,\r\nfor God’s sake! I feel a cobra crawling about my legs!’ He knew that\r\ntimidity was one of the strongest characteristics of this snake, and\r\nthat if not disturbed or alarmed, it would in due time depart of its\r\nown accord. All present were accustomed to the stealthy intruders, and\r\ndid not, happily, lose their presence of mind. They very noiselessly\r\nbent down so as to take a survey beneath the table, when, sure enough,\r\nthere was the unwelcome visitor, a full-sized cobra, twining and\r\ngliding about the legs of their hapless friend. Literally death was at\r\nhis feet! A movement, a noise, even an agitated tremble might have been\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\nLuckily one of the four was acquainted with the milk-loving habit of\r\nthe cobra, and rising from his seat with quiet and cautious movements,\r\nnot daring to hasten, yet dreading delay, he managed to steal from\r\nthe room, while he signed the rest to remain motionless. Quickly he\r\ncrept back with a saucer of milk in his hand, and still with noiseless\r\nmovements set the saucer under the table as close to the terrible\r\nreptile as it was safe to venture.\r\n\r\nThat fearful strain on their nerves was happily of not long duration,\r\nfor presently they were relieved by seeing the creature gradually\r\nuntwine itself and go to the milk.\r\n\r\nNever before or since did that officer leap from his seat as he did\r\nthen, the moment he felt himself free from the coils of the cobra, and\r\nread in the faces of his comrades that he was saved. Short thrift,\r\nhowever, had Mr. Cobra, for sticks and whip-handles were freely\r\nadministered, even before the saucer was reached.\r\n\r\nThe enemy got rid of, the game was resumed; and it is worth the while\r\nof those in India to bear this narrow escape in mind, and bring milk to\r\nthe rescue in case of similar danger.\r\n\r\nThat snakes drink, and occasionally drink milk, is sufficiently\r\nestablished. Modern authorities now affirm it decidedly. Says Dr.\r\nGünther in his great work, published by the Ray Society,[27] ‘All\r\nsnakes drink, and _die_ when deprived of water.’ Dr. Edward Nicholson,\r\nanother of our practical ophiologists, speaking of one of his pet\r\nsnakes, a _Tropidonotus_, says ‘the offer of a drink of water will at\r\nonce gain its heart.’ In watching snakes drinking, he has frequently\r\ncounted one hundred gulps before the drinker is satisfied.[28] If\r\n_Anguis fragilis_, the common blindworm, from its snake-like form, may\r\nbe cited here, I may mention one of my own, which, after being shut up\r\nin a box for safety during my absence from home for some days, drank\r\nfor such a long while when first released from captivity, that I was\r\nreally tired of waiting to watch her. She almost immediately went to\r\na flower-pot saucer of water, with which she was familiar, and which\r\nI placed near her. For some time I watched the tongue thrown out and\r\nwithdrawn, till I began to wonder how much longer she would remain\r\ndipping that little bifid organ. I then began to count, and she dipped\r\nit seventy-five times more, after drinking at least as long as that\r\npreviously. Then she moved away, and explored among the books on the\r\ntable, but soon returned to the saucer and dipped her tongue again\r\nupwards of seventy times. How much more I cannot affirm, as I could\r\nnot remain any longer waiting for her, and left her still drinking.\r\n(‘Lizzie,’ thus named from her lizard nature, must claim a chapter\r\nto herself in this book, for she greatly distinguished herself in\r\nlacertine doings.)\r\n\r\nWhile puzzling over this drinking question, I find a favourite author,\r\nP. H. Gosse, affirm, ‘Snakes drink by suction, not by lapping,’ and\r\nthat ‘serpents are said to lap up fluids with their forked tongue,\r\nwhich, however, seems to be ill suited to such an operation.’[29]\r\n\r\nThen one naturally turns to the encyclopedias, where we grow still more\r\nperplexed, for no two agree precisely on all points.\r\n\r\n‘The use of the tongue in serpents is not exactly known.’[30] And\r\nagain, ‘It is believed that serpents never drink.’[31] It is true that\r\nthe compiler of the article _Reptilia_ quotes Schlegel a good deal;\r\nbut unfortunately that is the very point on which Schlegel speaks\r\ndoubtfully. Nor do we presume to include the learned Schlegel as one\r\nof the inaccurately informed individuals, though he does discredit\r\nthe milk-drinkers. Of him Dumeril thus writes, or of his work rather,\r\nwhich he pronounced to be ‘le plus detaillé et le plus complet qui\r\nait paru jusqu’ici (1844), et auquel nous serons sans cesse obligé\r\nd’avoir recours.’ Schlegel is also quoted by Cantor, 1841; by Dr. J. E.\r\nGray, 1849; by Dr. A. Günther, 1864; and, in fact, by most scientific\r\nophiologists. Natural history is an ever-advancing science, more so,\r\nperhaps, than any other. Linnæus and Cuvier were great in their day,\r\nbut their systems obtain no longer.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a dozen book-makers and a thousand journalists seek\r\nno farther than encyclopedias when they are ‘reading up’ a subject;\r\nand not until too late, if at all, or after long searchings and a\r\nrealization of the importance of dates, do these wide spreaders of\r\ninformation discover the error. Compilers of articles for encyclopedias\r\nare always limited as to space, and often as to time; and life would\r\nnot be long enough to wade through _Zoological Records_ covering fifty\r\nyears, or _Annales des sciences naturelles_ which date from 1824 to the\r\npresent time. Only, the compilers of articles on the _Reptilia_ should\r\nsurely have known of Mr. Bell’s _Coluber natrix_, and of the Paris\r\npython, and of the _Amphisbæna_ of the Zoological Gardens, all ophidian\r\ncelebrities in their day.\r\n\r\nThe mention of the Zoological Gardens reminds me of my promise\r\nto conduct my readers thither as an agreeable change from the\r\nbook-shelves. Therefore, without further wearying them with the\r\nconflicting statements of fifty writers, let us repair thither, and see\r\nwhat Holland, the keeper, tells us about his thirsty snakes.\r\n\r\nFirst, we observe that most of the cages are furnished with a tank or\r\na pan of water, and this not for the watersnakes only. Many of the\r\nothers, also, are lying in their bath, coiled up in apparent enjoyment.\r\nQuestioning the intelligent keeper, he tells us that when fresh\r\nophidian inmates arrive, they almost invariably go to the water, and\r\nthough for a time they refuse food, they _always drink_. On several\r\noccasions some have drunk so eagerly that the water has visibly sunk in\r\nthe tank. These were the larger snakes, of course. He does ‘not believe\r\nthey would live without water.’ He then tells us the story of the\r\n_Amphisbæna_ over again, the snake that lived for six months on milk\r\nonly, and which was chronicled in the zoological magazines of the day,\r\nand has figured in books ever since.\r\n\r\nMr. Mann confirmed all these facts in his own ophidian pets, and going\r\nto see these interesting individuals, we felt no doubt about it when a\r\nsaucer of water was in the way.\r\n\r\nBut I do feel inclined to doubt whether the use of the tongue in\r\n‘lapping,’ as it has been called, is not rather to moisten that organ\r\nthan to quench the thirst. We shall see in the following chapter what\r\nit does for its owner, and we shall see the necessity for this delicate\r\norgan to be well lubricated. Both it and its sheath require to be\r\nconstantly moistened; how else could it glide in and out with that\r\nwonderful activity? how in a dry and parched condition could it retain\r\nits exceeding flexibility and delicacy of perception?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the position of the tanks in the cages at the London\r\nZoological Gardens, and the stone ledge in front of them, prevent the\r\nvisitors from watching the actions of the snakes in the water, either\r\nwhen swimming or drinking. Occasionally one of the inmates of the\r\nlarger cages may be seen in a pan of water, though their motions are\r\nnecessarily restricted there. One day, however, the yellow Jamaica\r\nboa, when drinking from the pan, afforded an excellent opportunity for\r\nobservation. And he was a long time imbibing. There was no perceptible\r\naction of the lips, which were barely parted. The snake kept its mouth\r\njust below the level of the water, and the only action or movement\r\nseen was at the back of the head, or on each side of the neck, like\r\na pulsation, as the water passed down in short gulps. This is the\r\n‘suction’ which writers describe, a drawing in of the liquid; but the\r\nlips do not take part in the act. When, therefore, we read that snakes\r\ndrink both by lapping and also by suction, we may surmise that the\r\nformer is for the benefit of the tongue, the latter of the body; and\r\na large quantity of liquid is often drawn in by this sort of suction,\r\nvery distinct from ‘sucking,’ the reputed way of enjoying milk from the\r\nliving fountain, and a process impossible to creatures that have not\r\nsoft lips and a broad tongue. The Jamaica boa drew in those perceptible\r\ngulps for a long time, then raised his head, and rested awhile, and\r\npresently drank again, and this several times while we were watching.\r\nIt was what Dumeril described _à la régalade_.\r\n\r\nMr. Sam Lockwood of New Jersey, writing in the _American Naturalist_,\r\nvol. ix. 1875, describes the pine snake drinking. ‘It lays its head\r\nflat upon the water, letting the lower jaw just sink a little below the\r\nsurface, when with a very uniform movement the water is drawn up into\r\nthe mouth and passed into the throat. It is true drinking, like that of\r\na horse.’ One that he watched drank five minutes by the clock without\r\ntaking breath. Then it paused, looked about for three minutes, and then\r\ndrank again for five minutes more. ‘In all, it drank a little over a\r\ngill. Previously it has been without water for four weeks.’\r\n\r\nIn size this pine snake differs not much from the Jamaica boa\r\n(_Chilobothrus inornatus_), that we watched at the Gardens, and the\r\nmanner and time were very similar. True, we did not time him by a\r\nwatch, nor could we tell exactly how much he drank, nor how long\r\npreviously he had been without drinking; but, at a guess, he could not\r\nhave been much less than five minutes without taking breath. _Anguis\r\nfragilis_, that lapped seventy times, and stopped, and lapped again,\r\nmust also have been some minutes without breathing, because hers was\r\nthe most leisurely lapping I ever saw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_THE TONGUE OF A SNAKE._\r\n\r\nPART I.—WHAT IT IS _NOT_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOSSIP from the Zoological Gardens to confirm what has been so often\r\nsaid, namely, that nine out of every ten of the visitors to the\r\nOphidarium will point to the tongue of a snake and exclaim, ‘Look\r\nat its sting!’ seems too trivial and too defiantly challenging the\r\ncredulity of my readers, to introduce here. Nevertheless, that it is\r\nnecessary emphatically to state not only that the tongue of a snake is\r\nnot its sting, but that a snake has no sting at all, you will admit\r\nthe very next time you go there. You will hear not only the Monday,\r\nbut the _Sunday_ visitors—well dressed, and apparently well educated\r\npersons—say to each other when watching a snake, ‘That’s its sting!’ I\r\nmust be permitted, therefore, to ‘gossip’ a moment in confirmation.\r\n\r\nOne Friday, in April 1881, just before the time when the public were\r\nexcluded at feeding hours, we were watching the movements of a pretty\r\nlittle harmless snake, the rapid quivering of whose tongue denoted\r\nexcitement of some kind. Probably it was anticipating the frog in\r\nstore for it, as this was feeding day. Its tongue was unusually active,\r\nand was exserted to its extreme length, its motions being almost\r\ninvisible in their rapidity.\r\n\r\nTwo gentlemen drew near, and also stopped before this cage. One of\r\nthem, a tall, dark man, looked like a foreigner; but he was talking\r\npure English to his friend, and had been talking a good deal about the\r\nsnakes, as if he were familiar with their habits. ‘From the Tropics,’\r\nobserved my companion, _sotto voce_, and looking as if we might hear\r\nsomething worth knowing from this large, loud-voiced visitor.\r\n\r\n‘See _that_?’ he presently exclaimed to his friend. ‘Look there!’\r\n\r\n‘That thing it keeps putting out of its mouth?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes. That’s its sting. One touch of that, just one little touch, and\r\nyou’re a dead man. There’s no cure for it!’\r\n\r\nNo less than four different parties made similar remarks in our hearing\r\nduring our short visit to the reptile house that day, and these not of\r\nthe common crowd either.\r\n\r\nFirst, two lads who looked as if they ought to have known better. Next,\r\na party of several persons, of whom the one more particularly addressed\r\nwhen his friend informed him, ‘That’s the sting that it jerks out so,’\r\nreplied, ‘Ah, but they extract it!’ Thirdly, a young gentleman remarked\r\nto his lady companion, ‘See how it keeps darting out its sting!’ to\r\nwhom she ejaculated, ‘Oh, the fearful creature!’ Fourthly, the tall\r\nman. And all this of poor little innocent _Tropidonotus_ (our common\r\nring snake), with not even a fang to injure you!\r\n\r\nLike many other of the zoological myths not yet extinct, this\r\n‘stinging tongue’ has its origin in mystery. Long before a deadly\r\nserpent was examined by an intelligent reasoner, and the nature of its\r\nfatal stroke comprehended, the mysterious ‘dart’ was seen to play;\r\nthis, to the ignorant, being the only visible and possible instrument\r\nof such fatality. But that the fable should still obtain is amazing.\r\nEven some learned men of the present century, if they do not happen to\r\nhave included natural history in their studies, assist in disseminating\r\nthe error. Can they, however, be acquainted with classical writers?\r\nPliny, to whom many of the old-time errors in natural history have\r\nbeen traced, must be acquitted as regards the poisonous tongue; for\r\nthough he speaks of the ‘sting’ of a serpent, I do not recall that he\r\nonce attributed the injury to the tongue. Aristotle, whose reputation\r\nas a naturalist ranks far higher, distinctly and frequently speaks of\r\nthe _bite_, and the degrees of injury inflicted by the various kinds\r\nof serpent bites. It is possible that some classical writers may have\r\nsupposed the tongue to be an instrument of death, as it is certain\r\nthat some of the sacred writers did. But our inherited faith in Bible\r\nhistory has, until recently, checked all doubt and even inquiry. Now,\r\nhowever, that a new version of Holy Writ has been deemed essential, it\r\nis to be hoped that an efficient naturalist is included in the Council.\r\n\r\nIn justification of the above criticism I may be permitted to quote\r\njust one of the many unquestioning writers. The author of the _History\r\nof Egypt_, W. Holt Yates, M.R.C.P. of London, President of the Royal\r\nMedical Society of Edinburgh, Physician to the General Dispensary,\r\netc., says in a footnote (vol. i. p. 322), ‘It is a mistake to suppose\r\nthat snakes hurt only with their teeth. Some have no teeth, but only\r\nhard gums. Others only attack with their tongue—the same end is\r\nattained in either case by the insertion of the poison.’\r\n\r\nNow were you to ask that writer, as I have several times asked persons\r\nwho were under the same impression, ‘What reason have you to suppose\r\nthat the snake’s tongue is poisonous?’ he would very likely reply,\r\n‘Oh! well—it _is_ venomous. I always thought so.’ Then, reflectively,\r\nhe might add, ‘Poisonous-tongued?—“whose tongue outvenoms”—“with\r\ndeadlier tongue than thine, thou serpent”’—or some such familiar\r\nwords, proving that his idea was poetical, imaginative, and acquired he\r\ncan scarcely explain how.\r\n\r\nWhat very little he knew about snakes, then, was learned from\r\nShakspeare—we say Shakspeare, for what other author has been read and\r\nre-read, and committed to memory, and quoted during the last three\r\ncenturies like the Bard of Avon? The bard, genius though he was, and\r\nwide his field of information, was certainly _not_ a naturalist. Nor\r\ndid he make any pretensions to be one. He was as unconscious of the\r\nerrors in natural history which he was handing down to posterity, as\r\nhe was unconscious of his own enduring fame; or that he would be ‘the\r\nimmortal bard’ three hundred years later, with every probability of\r\never living in the human mind as such.\r\n\r\nHis idea of the poisonous tongue of a snake was the prevalent one of\r\nhis day. It was an inherited prejudice, which he had never stopped\r\nto question, any more than nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every\r\nthousand of his readers have ever stopped to question the fact of an\r\nadder’s _tongue_ being poisonous, Shakspeare having affirmed that it is\r\nso.\r\n\r\nPeople do not read Shakspeare to learn natural history, you say. True;\r\nbut his poetry, his similes, take hold of the mind, fix themselves in\r\nthe memory, and take root; and an assertion, as in the case of the\r\ngentle little ‘blindworm,’ takes very deep root, as it seems, and\r\nthrives for three hundred years; or naturalists of the present day\r\nwould not feel called upon to explain that it is neither ‘blind,’ nor\r\n‘deaf,’ nor ‘venomous.’\r\n\r\nStill you reject the idea that Shakspeare through his immense and\r\nuniversal popularity is responsible for a ridiculous error. Not\r\nShakspeare alone, then, or culpably so. But since the idea has\r\nprevailed for thousands of years, even to the present time, and since\r\npersons are more likely to quote Shakspeare on the subject than any\r\nother author, let us glance at the literature of Shakspeare’s time,\r\nand endeavour to account for his fixed impression as to a serpent’s\r\ntongue being poisonous. Let us also try to recall from any one of the\r\nwriters of the same era, or those who wrote in English previously, any\r\nsingle line on the present subject that has become so engrafted on the\r\nmind, so incorporated with our education, as those, for example, above\r\nquoted. There was a host of other play-writers in Shakspeare’s time,\r\nbut very few naturalists.\r\n\r\nPoetry, plays, and Protestantism characterized the literature of the\r\nperiod. But familiar to us _by name_ as are his contemporaries, it will\r\nbe as easy to find one educated person who has read the whole of their\r\nworks, as it would be to find one educated person who has not read\r\nShakspeare.\r\n\r\nThere were travels and histories written, the great maritime\r\ndiscoveries of the age giving birth to this new class of literature.\r\nHakluyt’s voyages were printed when Shakspeare was only twenty-five\r\nyears of age, and even if he read them he would not have learned much\r\nabout serpents there. Nor in Sir Walter Raleigh’s histories either,\r\nwhich were written chiefly during his prison life, he being liberated\r\nthe same year that saw the death of Shakspeare, 1616.\r\n\r\nMany other well-known authors will occur to the reader, to say nothing\r\nof the writers of the previous eras, the great divines and scholars who\r\nwrote in Latin, and the many English ballad-writers more likely to be\r\nperused by ‘the Bard.’\r\n\r\nAs for natural history, it found no place on those shelves, for as a\r\nscience it did not as yet exist in England. Lord Bacon, Shakspeare’s\r\ncelebrated contemporary, did make some pretensions to be a naturalist;\r\nbut his _Novum Organum_ was written in Latin, and we are not led to\r\nbelieve that the poet enjoyed any very great educational and classical\r\nadvantages, having had\r\n\r\n  ‘Small Latin and less Greek,’\r\n\r\naccording to his friend and eulogist, Ben Jonson.\r\n\r\nAnd even if Shakspeare did read what was then _the Book_ of the period,\r\nLord Bacon unfortunately fell into some of the popular errors, or made\r\nvery hazardous conjectures, so far as natural history was understood;\r\nand of him Dr. Carpenter says, ‘So far from contributing to our\r\nknowledge of natural history, he often gave additional force to error\r\nby the weight of his authority.’\r\n\r\nIn recalling some lines from Shakspeare, the reader will find how very\r\nfamiliar to the mind are the serpent similes. Some of them prove that\r\nthe poet was cognizant of a tooth being also a source of evil; but\r\nit is evident that he thought the tongue was so also, especially the\r\ntongue of the ‘blindworm.’\r\n\r\nFor a few out of the many in which Shakspeare’s plays abound, _vide_\r\n_Timon of Athens_, Act iv. Scene 3: ‘The gilded newt and eyeless\r\nvenomed worm.’\r\n\r\n_Midsummer Night’s Dream_, Act iii. Scene 2. When Hermia thinks\r\nthat Demetrius has killed Lysander while sleeping, she scathingly\r\nejaculates: ‘O brave touch! Could not a worm, an adder do so much? An\r\nadder did it; for with deadlier tongue than thine, thou serpent, never\r\nadder stung!’\r\n\r\nIn _Cymbeline_, Act iii. Scene 2, Pisanio says: ‘What false Italian, as\r\npoisonous tongued as handed, hath prevailed on thy too ready hearing?’\r\nAgain, in Scene 4 of the same Act, Pisanio would not hear evil of his\r\nmistress, and cries: ‘No, ‘tis slander; whose edge is sharper than the\r\nsword, whose tongue outvenoms all the worms.’\r\n\r\n_Henry VI._, Act ii. Scene 2, Clifford says to the King: ‘Who ‘scapes\r\nthe lurking serpent’s mortal sting!’ Act iii. Scene 2: ‘Their touch\r\naffrights me as a serpent’s sting.... What! art thou like the adder\r\nwaxen deaf? Be poisonous too!’\r\n\r\n_Much Ado about Nothing_, Act v. Scene 1, Antonio says: ‘As I dare take\r\na serpent by the tongue.’\r\n\r\nAnd in _King John_, Act ii. Scene 1, Randolph says to King Philip,\r\n‘France, thou may’st hold a serpent by the tongue!’\r\n\r\nNot snakes only, but toads, lizards, spiders, and other ‘creeping\r\nthings,’ were thought venomous in Shakspeare’s time.\r\n\r\nSong in _Midsummer Night’s Dream_: ‘You spotted snakes, with double\r\ntongue.’ Then, in appeal to the ‘serpents’ not to injure the Fairy\r\nQueen: ‘Newts and blindworms, do no wrong.’\r\n\r\nThe nearest approach to a scientific work on natural history written in\r\nEnglish at that time was a curious volume published in 1608, in whose\r\nfolio pages may be seen most astonishing ‘Serpentes,’ combinations\r\nof worms and feathered fowls, saurian, ophidian, and batrachian,\r\nwonderfully adorned with horns, gills, wings, spear-shaped or forked\r\ntongues, and arrow-shaped tails. The zoological illustrations of that\r\nwork give us some idea of what a snake was supposed to be. Among them\r\nis one with a human head, and another with a crown, because he is ‘the\r\nKing of Serpentes for his Magnitude or Greatnesse.’ There is also a\r\n‘Dragon’ with horns, wings, scales, claws, two rows of robust teeth,\r\nand an arrow-headed tongue. Mingled fable and fancy with some few\r\nfacts, these anomalies are solemnly described as ‘The Naturall Historie\r\nof Serpentes,’ the said serpents including bees, wasps, ‘frogges,’\r\ntoads, earthworms, lizards, spiders, etc., and a ‘cockatrice.’\r\n\r\nThe author, E. Topsell, addresses the ‘gentle and pious Reader’ on the\r\n‘publishing of this Treatise of Venomous Beasts,’ and more particularly\r\nof ‘Serpentes, Divine, Morall, and Naturell, their Poyson and Bitings,\r\nsince the gentle and pious Reader will see how that the Historie of\r\nSerpentes begineth at the Creation.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fabulous tongues.]\r\n\r\nThus we see that the ideal snake was a religious principle, carried\r\nout in illustrations and architectural embellishments, where ‘that\r\nold serpent the devil’ was depicted as a creature as terrible as\r\nimagination could conceive it; and of course with a highly-developed\r\ntongue in the form of a dart or a spear, more or less alarming.\r\n\r\nFar in advance of Topsell, and far in advance of England, were the\r\nnaturalists of Southern Europe. Gesner, professor of philosophy at\r\nZurich, published his _Historia Animalium_ in 1551; and Aldrovanus,\r\nprofessor of philosophy and physic at Bologna, wrote thirteen folio\r\nvolumes of natural history, four only of which were published during\r\nhis lifetime, and the rest after his death, which was in 1605. These\r\ntwo authors, though out of date at the present day, have left their\r\nnames perpetuated in plants and animals examined by them.\r\n\r\nAs one of the objects of this work is to trace the origin of some of\r\nthe many errors that have obtained regarding the serpent race, and to\r\nnote the gradual enlightenment observable in successive writers, it is\r\na part of our duty to quote the Bible; and this we do with reverence,\r\nemboldened by the fact that the present state of knowledge has demanded\r\na new translation to satisfy the intellect of the age.\r\n\r\nShakspeare himself might have had the Bible devoutly in his mind when\r\nhe talked of the adder’s ‘sting.’\r\n\r\nAmong the many commentators and exponents of Holy Writ, Cruden (A.D.\r\n1794) says, ‘Some place the venom of the serpent in its gall, others\r\nin its tongue, and others in its teeth.’ David seems to place it in\r\nits tongue:—Ps. cxl. 3, ‘They have sharpened their tongues like a\r\nserpent.’ So also Job, xx. 16, ‘The viper’s tongue shall slay him.’\r\n\r\nThe sacred writers, however, quite understood that serpents did bite as\r\nwell as ‘sting.’ Solomon made the same distinction that is observable\r\nin Shakspeare, ‘biteth like a serpent, stingeth like an adder.’\r\n\r\nIn fact, the _tongue_ of an adder, whether in allusion to ‘the worm of\r\nthe Nile,’ or to our own pretty little ‘deaf-adder,’ seems still to\r\nbear the evil character which it has borne from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nSuperstition, prejudice, and ignorance are still rampant whenever a\r\nsnake is thought of. Inherited and educated antipathies regarding them\r\nare still so strong that some persons will not even allow themselves to\r\n_un_learn their misconceptions; others by misrepresentations do their\r\nbest to prevent a true comprehension of their habits from being better\r\nunderstood; and, again, there are those who know better, and who are\r\neven engaged in instructing others by their pen, but who fall into the\r\nhabit of encouraging horror and hatred, instead of reason, truth, and a\r\ntolerance towards a creature wisely produced to fulfil its part and to\r\nperform its duties in the great balance of organized beings.\r\n\r\nSome journalists religiously keep up the delusion about the tongue\r\nof a snake, by using a prejudicial prefix. From a pile of newspaper\r\ncuttings and other printed matter relative to snakes, I transcribe a\r\nfew sentences at random, to illustrate what is meant:—‘Its horrid\r\nforked tongue.’ ‘Its slithering tongue.’ ‘Its villanous poisonous\r\ntongue,’ etc. And if sensationalism seem to demand still more forcible\r\nlanguage, as, for instance, in describing an injury or an escape, our\r\njournalist tells us of the ‘forked tongue darting defiance.’ ‘The\r\nwicked-looking serpent tongue protruded with lightning-like swiftness.’\r\n‘To see the reptile run its devilish tongue out at you.’ ‘Its horrid\r\nlancinating tongue protruded,’ etc. These are only a few of such\r\nsentences copied _verbatim_, but they are unfortunately too common,\r\neven with the better-informed writers.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a snake being sufficiently intelligent, reasoning, and\r\nreflective to deliberately ‘run its tongue out at you,’ as if conscious\r\nof its own moral power and your moral weakness, is too ludicrous.\r\nIf the snake could truly inflict injury with those soft, flexible,\r\ndelicate filaments,—if it could, with one rapid touch, insert poison,\r\nas the tall talker at the Zoological Gardens affirmed, the threatening\r\nquiver could only be in friendly warning. Let the poor reptile at least\r\nbe thanked for that.\r\n\r\nOur lamented friend, Frank Buckland, fell into the same error (or\r\ninadvertency, since he quite understood that the tongue could do no\r\nharm) when he wrote thus of the tongue in his _Curiosities of Natural\r\nHistory_:—‘The tongue is generally protruded in order to intimidate\r\nthe bystanders;’ and, ‘The tongue acts as a sort of intimidation\r\nto its aggressors;’ thus giving the snake the credit of a waggish\r\nsort of intelligence, far more complimentary to the reptile than\r\nto the bystander. In imagination we behold a solemn Convention of\r\nsnakes, held in ages long ago, and a resolution to this effect passed\r\nunanimously:—‘Now these poor ignorant mortals think we can kill them\r\nwith our soft and tender tongues. Though so tall, and powerful, and\r\nterrible to us, they look dreadfully frightened whenever we use our\r\ntongues in our own service. Therefore, whenever any of these two-legged\r\ncreatures come near us, we will put out our tongues at them, and\r\nfrighten them off,’—a resolution which has answered admirably well\r\ndown to the present time. ‘Down to the present time’ is written and\r\nrepeated in all seriousness.\r\n\r\nLet me be pardoned for introducing a little more gossip here, as it is\r\nthe fashion to relate what is seen and heard at the Zoological Gardens.\r\nAnd so much is related, and has been related, and even printed, to\r\nmislead the public, that, in the earnest hope and aspiration of\r\nassisting in correcting false impressions, I claim to repeat what was\r\nheard as well as the rest. Besides, when persons talk as loudly as if\r\nthey were delivering a lecture, and apparently with the benevolent\r\nintention of instructing the public generally, one feels justified in\r\nquoting them.\r\n\r\nEight years ago, when first contemplating this work, and anxiously\r\nseeking to ascertain precisely what could be learned, and what was\r\nalready understood about snakes, so far as the reptile house at the\r\nZoological Gardens was a means of instruction, I made very careful\r\nnotes of what I saw there, and occasionally of what I _heard_ there.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1874 some well-dressed children, accompanied by their\r\nparents, were watching the pythons in the largest cage, when one of\r\nthe little ones asked, ‘Papa, what is that thing that the snake keeps\r\nputting out of its mouth?’ ‘Oh, that is its poisonous sting,’ replied\r\nthe father. The eldest girl (in her teens), with an affected shudder,\r\ncried ‘Ugh!’ and a boy exclaimed, ‘I am glad it can’t put it through\r\nthe glass at _us_!’\r\n\r\nAugust 3, 1877.—A gentleman, to all appearance well-bred and\r\nintelligent, told his two boys, ‘That’s the sting,’ as they were\r\nwatching the play of a snake’s tongue in one of the cages. The boys\r\nlooked wonderingly at the terrible instrument, and were evidently\r\nanxious to know more about it, and turned to ask their father. But he\r\nhad passed on, and was then calling to them to look at something else.\r\n\r\nJuly 1880.—A lady, apparently the governess of two girls of about\r\ntwelve and fourteen, and of a boy of about eight, who were with her,\r\nwas conscientiously endeavouring to blend instruction with amusement,\r\nand was telling them some strange and hitherto unheard-of facts\r\nabout the snakes; as, for instance, that the rattlesnake was now\r\ngoing to ‘crush a guinea-pig by winding itself round it;’ for it was\r\nfeeding-day, and the keeper had just put poor piggy into the cage.\r\nBut the children got tired of waiting to see what did not occur; the\r\nrattlesnake was merely investigating matters by means of its useful\r\ntongue. ‘Now, watch it!’ cried the lady eagerly, ‘and you’ll see it\r\nlick the guinea-pig with its poisonous tongue.’\r\n\r\nNeither was this feat performed by the Crotalus, and as the children\r\ngot tired of waiting, and were impatient to ‘see something else,’ the\r\nparty moved on.\r\n\r\nBut the reader will be weary of hearing what the tongue of a snake is\r\n_not_, and be desirous of knowing what it _is_; and to this purpose we\r\nwill devote another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n_THE TONGUE OF A SNAKE._\r\n\r\nPART II.—WHAT IT _IS_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIF only by the law of compensation, another chapter must be devoted to\r\nthe innocent tongue of a snake. It has been an object of hatred and\r\naversion for untold ages, and the misrepresentation of it, and the\r\nabuse of it, would fill many chapters. Were it endowed with speech, and\r\nthe words of St. James applied to it,—‘the tongue is a fire, a world\r\nof iniquity,’—no stronger animosity could be displayed.\r\n\r\nHappily, this animosity is by degrees dying away; but only by degrees,\r\nas we have seen, some writers during the last twenty years having\r\nbeen undergoing a sort of transition state with regard to the use of\r\nthe tongue, inasmuch as, while they have arrived at the conviction\r\nthat it does not ‘sting,’ they are not yet quite clear as to what it\r\ndoes do. Some few have even clung to the lubrication theory. _Popular\r\nwriters_, to speak more correctly, not scientific ones. Still, it is\r\nthe popular writers who most influence the casual reader. To satisfy a\r\npassing interest, we turn to these, to the books they quote, and next\r\nto encyclopedias, and not to scientific text-books, where we are beset\r\nby technicalities which are in themselves a study to be first mastered.\r\nOtherwise, from scientific works a good deal might have been learned\r\nlong ago about this exceedingly wonderful organ, the tongue of a snake.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that a good many of our drawing-room\r\nnaturalists have not thought it necessary to first devote themselves to\r\nthe scientific study of a snake’s tongue before they ventured to write\r\nabout it; therefore they remained only partially enlightened. To such\r\nan extent has the supposed ‘lubrication’ prevailed, that ophiologists\r\nof the day have not thought it too trivial to speak of and to refute.\r\nThe same visitors to the Zoological Gardens who tell their friends or\r\nchildren to look at the snake’s ‘sting,’ also wait to ‘see the snake\r\nlick the rabbit all over before it begins to swallow it.’\r\n\r\nWere a painter to set to work to paint a house, or a mason to whitewash\r\nthe ceiling, with a camel’s-hair pencil, it would not be a more tedious\r\nand impossible process than that of a snake ‘licking all over with its\r\ntongue’ the body of the animal it is about to devour. Illustrations, in\r\norder to be as startling as possible, and to feed the educated horror\r\nof snakes, often represent a boa or an anaconda coiled round a bull or\r\nsome other equally large and rough-coated animal, which, as the writer\r\ninforms us, ‘it was seen to lick all over and cover with its mucus.’\r\n\r\nLet the reader reflect a moment, and he will perceive what supply\r\nof moisture this degree of lubrication would demand. Even were the\r\nsnake’s whole body furnished with salivary glands, and were it provided\r\nwith a broad, flat tongue to work with, what must the rate of secretion\r\nbe to enable the snake to go through such a task, and to enable it to\r\nperform it in a period of time in which a spectator (supposing he had\r\nsufficient powers of endurance) could stand by and watch the process!\r\n\r\nSnakes are, it is true, supplied very abundantly with a mucous saliva.\r\nDescribing the mode of swallowing, Dr. Günther says: ‘But for the\r\nquantity of saliva discharged over the body of the prey, deglutition\r\nwould be slow.’ Slow in comparison with the feeding of other animals\r\nit is, under any circumstances, and it would be painfully tedious,\r\nalmost impossible, for the unfortunate reptile to feed at all, were\r\nits difficulties not relieved by this ‘abundant supply’ of saliva.\r\nBut this is not saying that the tongue performs any office in\r\nsystematic lubrication. It simply means that the mouth of the hungry\r\nsnake ‘waters’ over its food, and waters far more freely than is the\r\nusual case with other animals. We ourselves know something of this\r\nstimulation of the salivary glands at the sight or smell of food when\r\nwe are hungry; but snakes are beneficently provided with the salivary\r\napparatus (described in the first chapter), and the mouth waters\r\nover its prey, as much when the tongue is in its sheath as when the\r\ntongue is engaged in its own peculiar and distinct functions. What the\r\nspectator does see is this tongue fulfilling its office of feeling,\r\nexamining, exploring, investigating, ascertaining whether the prey is\r\nthoroughly dead, and the best way of setting to work on the great task\r\nof swallowing the huge, rough mass. All this work the tongue does for\r\nits owner; and we shall, as I hope, see before we have done with it,\r\nthat so far from exciting our hatred and disgust, there is perhaps no\r\nother feature or organ belonging to the helpless snake so important\r\nto it, so worthy of our own observation and admiration, as this\r\nmuch-abused tongue.\r\n\r\nWe have an admirable opportunity for study in our visits to the\r\nZoological Gardens, and there the lover of nature can decide for\r\nhimself. Hours and hours has one watched, and I admit (in the early\r\ndays of my studies) _waited_, to see this lubrication which, as the\r\nbooks told me, was performed by the tongue. Often and often one has\r\nheard visitors say to each other when they have seen the prey about to\r\nbe devoured, ‘Now we shall see, or you will see’ (as the case might be)\r\n‘the snake lick it all over before he swallows it.’\r\n\r\nAn observation to this effect was once made in our hearing while I was\r\non the point of asking the keeper if he had ever observed anything of\r\nthe kind, and was telling him how often it had been so stated in print.\r\n\r\n‘Snakes never did, and never _will_, lick their prey, ma’am,’ returned\r\nHolland emphatically; ‘but I have seen the saliva flow, it is so\r\nplentiful.’ And so have I, and so may you, patient reader, if you are\r\nsufficiently interested in the subject. You will soon become convinced\r\nthat such a process as ‘licking’ is impossible, and you will soon\r\ndecide that if the reptile did this instinctively, its tongue would\r\nhave developed into something more like that of a cat, strong and rough\r\nwith tiny spines, or some organ better adapted to the performance than\r\na thin pencil or fork of tender flesh.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that a number of anecdotes which describe\r\nthis ‘lubrication’ have been retained and quoted over and over again in\r\nbooks on snakes. Writers who are conscientiously instructing us, and\r\nwho are even telling us ‘snakes do _not_ lick their prey,’ quote the\r\nanecdotes which tell us that they _do_, and thus appear to favour the\r\nassumed mistake.\r\n\r\nSpace will not permit of the numerous examples which might be here\r\nintroduced in proof of this. Nor is it necessary to name more than\r\ntwo or three of these misleading anecdotes; the reader will at once\r\nrecognise them, for they appear everywhere.\r\n\r\nFirst comes the M’Leod narrative, which has found favour with popular\r\nwriters for no less than sixty-three years! The first edition of the\r\n_Voyage of the Alceste_, by Dr. M’Leod, the surgeon on board, was\r\npublished in London in 1817, a second edition in 1818, and a third\r\n(so popular was the work) in 1819. His account of feeding the boa\r\nconstrictor was not the least popular part of the little book; for in\r\nthose days there were few who knew what to believe where a snake was\r\nconcerned. The account of a goat being swallowed fills several pages,\r\nwritten in a style to exaggerate horrors, and apparently deny to the\r\nreptile any right to obey nature’s laws. ‘The python fixed a deadly and\r\nmalignant eye on the goat:’ ... ‘first operation was to dart out its\r\nforked tongue:’ ... ‘continued to grasp with its fangs:’ ... ‘began\r\nto prepare for swallowing:’ and ‘commenced by lubricating with its\r\nsaliva:’ ... ‘commission of this murder,’ etc.\r\n\r\nMaunder, in his _Treasury of Natural History_, quotes this, having\r\npreviously stated (under the head Boa Constrictor): ‘The prey is\r\nthen prepared for being swallowed, which the creature accomplished by\r\npushing the limbs into the most convenient position, and _then covering\r\nthe surface with a glutinous saliva_.’ Though not positively asserted\r\nthat the tongue is the agent in this ‘covering,’ the reader naturally\r\njumps to this conclusion. The ‘Penny’ and several other encyclopedias\r\nquote the M’Leod story, among them the _Encyclopedia Britannica_, ed.\r\n1856, notwithstanding the compiler of the article ‘Reptilia’ affirms,\r\n‘The use of the tongue is not exactly known.’ Surely this licking over\r\nan enormous mass of fur or wool, each time the reptile partakes of\r\nfood, would be a very important use indeed of the tongue, did such a\r\nprocess take place.\r\n\r\nMr. Philip Henry Gosse, in his _Natural History of Reptiles_, 1860,\r\nrepeats the M’Leod story but he follows it up by also quoting a writer,\r\nBroderip, who carefully considered the subject, and who doubted the\r\npossibility of such a tongue performing this office.\r\n\r\nMr. Gosse is one of the most popular of our ‘drawing-room’ naturalists.\r\nA careful and conscientious writer, he has contributed in his various\r\nworks a great deal of valuable information, and has done as much, if\r\nnot more, towards inducing a taste for natural history than any other\r\nauthor of his day and class.\r\n\r\nAnother popular anecdote much used is that of Sir R. Ker Porter,\r\nwho (_cir._ 1820-24) sent an anaconda to the United Service Museum,\r\naccompanied by an account of its seizing its prey. ‘In an instant every\r\nbone is broken, and the long, fleshy tongue passes over the entire form\r\nof the lifeless beast, leaving on it a sort of glutinous saliva which\r\ngreatly facilitates deglutition.’ This last clause was particularly\r\nstriking, and you find those three words, ‘greatly facilitates\r\ndeglutition,’ used ever since by more writers than one can enumerate.\r\n\r\nA third of the many well-worn anecdotes in which the ‘lubrication’ is\r\nconspicuous, is taken from a German journal, the _Ephemerides_, in\r\nwhich a combat between a boa constrictor and a buffalo is described in\r\nthe approved sensational style, and this sentence occurs:—‘In order to\r\nmake the body slip down the throat more glibly, it (the snake) was seen\r\nto lick the whole body over, and thus cover it with its mucus.’\r\n\r\nPerhaps these three anecdotes, copied from book to book for, say, only\r\nfifty years, have done as much to mislead regarding the second reputed\r\nuse of the tongue, as Shakspeare and his predecessors did regarding the\r\nstinging theory.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Ker Porter published two very handsome quarto volumes\r\n(illustrated) of his _Travels in Georgia, Persia, and the East_, during\r\nthe years 1817 to 1821. Such a work from a distinguished traveller in\r\nthat day would soon grow into popularity; but, like Dr. M’Leod, he does\r\nnot describe his snake by the cool light of science.\r\n\r\nIn a very able article, ‘Boa’ in the good old _Penny Cyclopedia_,\r\ndated 1835, the writer, quoted by Mr. Philip Henry Gosse, mildly\r\ncriticises the lubrication theory, and gives at length an excellent\r\npaper on the subject, contributed to the _Zoological Journal_ in 1826\r\nby the distinguished naturalist, W. J. Broderip, F.L.S., etc.[32]\r\nVery courteously Mr. Broderip discusses Dr. McLeod’s description,\r\nand in giving an account of what he himself witnessed in the manner\r\nof a boa feeding, speaks of ‘the secretion of lubricating mucus\r\nbeing excessive,’ and that ‘the jaws dripped with the mucus which had\r\nlubricated the parts,’ but not once mentioning the tongue as having any\r\npart in this function. The writer in the _Penny Cyclopedia_ concludes\r\nby saying that he had himself frequently watched the snakes while\r\nfeeding, and they ‘never covered the victim; the tongue was thrust\r\nforth, but only,’ etc. And yet so many book-makers who must have read\r\nthis have copied the anecdotes without the comment, and have thus\r\npopularized the lingual lubrication!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n_THE TONGUE OF A SNAKE._\r\n\r\nPART III.—_ITS USES_.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE more function in which the tongue has no part it is important first\r\nto mention. ‘It is supposed to be concerned in the function of voice,\r\nthat is, hissing,’ says Mr. Frank Buckland in his _Curiosities of\r\nNatural History_, 1860. Now, as this is an extremely popular book, and\r\nas Mr. Buckland was a very popular writer, and much quoted and believed\r\nin from his pleasant and genial style, and his many opportunities, it\r\nis necessary to explain that the tongue is often or generally in its\r\nsheath while the snake hisses, and therefore has _no part whatever_ in\r\nthe ‘function of voice.’\r\n\r\nMore recently still, a writer in 1876 is under the same impression.\r\nIt is well known that the contributors to that excellent magazine,\r\nthe _Leisure Hour_, are for the most part persons of good literary\r\nstanding. However, in the matter of snakes we are all only learners.\r\n\r\nThere are in the magazine referred to, three chapters ‘On Snakes,’\r\noccupying, with the illustrations, about eight pages, in which the\r\ngeneral subject is treated.\r\n\r\n‘It is a very general belief that the sting of a poisonous snake is in\r\nits tongue,’ says this writer, ‘and to any one who has seen an adder\r\nready for attack, with its body coiled, its head and neck reared aloft,\r\nand its long, narrow tongue, split for a considerable distance from\r\nthe point inwards, and thus resembling a two-pronged fork, vibrating\r\nrapidly, accompanied by a hissing sound, the needle-like points of the\r\ntongue have a decidedly stinging aspect. It need hardly be said that\r\nthe tongue is only responsible for the hissing.’ The hissing is from\r\nthe lungs (see chap. ix.), and, as may be repeated, often while the\r\ntongue is within its sheath, the opening of which is forward in the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nThe tongue of a snake occupies much the same place in the lower jaw as\r\nthat of other animals; only being, while passive, within its sheath,\r\nwhich opens at the tip, the tongue can move but in one direction,\r\nnamely, _forwards_.\r\n\r\nThe illustration in the _Leisure Hour_ which accompanies the above\r\nwriter’s explanation, displays a rattlesnake with widely-extended jaws,\r\nand a tongue which, by comparison, must be from root to tip half a foot\r\nin length, and represented as coming from far back in the throat, as if\r\nno sheath existed.\r\n\r\nThe tongue of a snake not being so planted, and not by any possibility\r\nintercepting the breath, it is needless to repeat that it can never\r\nbe any agent of the voice, _i.e._ ‘hissing,’ nor is it every snake\r\nthat does hiss (see chap. ix.). Illustrations conveying an entirely\r\nerroneous impression are very much to be regretted, and unfortunately\r\nthis misplacing of the snake’s tongue is an extremely common error,\r\nand we recognise the familiar woodcut again and again in a number of\r\ndifferent publications, misconceptions thus being seriously multiplied.\r\nBad illustrations, even more than printed errors, are responsible,\r\nbecause more persons turn the leaves of a book to look at these, than\r\nthose who read the page, and a glance either instructs or misinforms\r\nthe eye.\r\n\r\nThe hissing of a snake, as we may here add, is merely an escape or\r\nexpulsion of air from the lungs, more or less quick or ‘loud,’ as\r\nthe reptile is more or less alarmed or angry. Conjecturally, one may\r\nsuppose this hissing to correspond with the agitated breathing or\r\npanting of other animals, or of an excited person.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, when travellers were visiting for the first\r\ntime the newly-settled colonies in America and Africa, and when the\r\nearly explorers in various parts of the world were sending home stuffed\r\nspecimens of animals (in the days when taxidermy, like other sciences,\r\nwas in its infancy), a stuffed snake was furnished with a huge, broad,\r\nfleshy tongue, big enough to crowd its entire mouth, minus teeth and\r\ngums.[33] Whether this broad tongue was to favour the delusion of\r\n‘licking,’ or whether the licking was presupposed from the look of the\r\ntongue, we cannot say, but that the stuffed specimens did encourage the\r\ndelusion is clear.\r\n\r\nOur Philosophical Society, founded about the middle of that century,\r\nand the ‘Philosophical Transactions’ of those days record the first\r\narrival of tropical serpents in England, and the marvellous beliefs\r\nconcerning them. From them we learn, nevertheless, that many things\r\nsaid to be ‘new to science’ in our own time, were not unknown two\r\ncenturies ago.\r\n\r\nPassing by a large number of writers on snakes, who, being convinced\r\nthat the tongue neither ‘stings’ nor ‘licks’ nor ‘aids in hissing,’\r\nand who, therefore, cursorily dismiss it with, ‘the use of the tongue\r\nis not known,’ let us thoroughly examine for ourselves this mysterious\r\norgan; and this we can do with the assistance of those who have devoted\r\ncareful attention to the subject.\r\n\r\nQuoting first our English authorities, Dr. J. E. Gray tells us: ‘Tongue\r\nvery long, retractile into a sheath at its base. Apex forked, very\r\nlong, slender, and tapering.’\r\n\r\nSays Dr. Günther: ‘Tongue long, vermiform, forked; an organ of touch;\r\nfrequently and rapidly exserted to examine an object. The slightest\r\nprovocation brings the tongue into play.’\r\n\r\nRymer Jones, in his _Organization of the Animal Kingdom_, tells us that\r\n‘in snakes the bulk of the tongue is reduced to the utmost extent. The\r\nwhole organ seems converted into a slender, bifid instrument of touch,\r\nand is covered with a delicate membrane.’ Again, in Todd’s _Cyclopedia\r\nof Anatomy_, the same writer says that ‘the tongue of a snake seems to\r\nperform functions, the nature of which is not so obvious’ (as that of\r\nsome other reptiles).\r\n\r\nDer Hœven (Clark’s translation) tells us ‘the tongue of a snake is an\r\norgan of feeling or tact, and much used, as the antennæ of insects.’\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that while no two of the above writers use\r\nprecisely the same words, each helps us to picture the tongue\r\nmore accurately, and we glean from each some new particular. The\r\n_Encyclopedia Britannica_, after telling us ‘the use of the tongue is\r\nnot exactly known,’ adds, ‘they (the snakes) are continually lancing it\r\ninto the air, and may possibly in this way gather moisture from grass\r\nor herbage’ (alluding to the question of ‘drinking,’ see chap. iv.).\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen still further defines it as a pair of muscles, or\r\na double muscle partly connected and partly free. The reader will\r\nprefer the learned Professor’s own words, notwithstanding the slight\r\nrepetition.\r\n\r\nIn his _Anatomy of the Vertebrates_, p. 463, after describing the\r\nprehensile character of the tongue in some reptiles, notably the toad\r\nand the chameleon, he says: ‘In serpents the tongue takes no other\r\nshare in the prehension of food than by the degree in which it may\r\nassist in the art of drinking. It is very long, slender, cylindrical,\r\nprotractile, consisting of a pair of muscular cylinders in close\r\nconnection along the two basal thirds, but liberated from each other,\r\nand tapering each to a point at the anterior third; these are in\r\nconstant vibration when the tongue is protruded, and are in great\r\npart withdrawn with the undivided body of the tongue into a sheath\r\nwhen the organ is retracted.’ The pair of parallel muscles can be\r\ndistinguished in the largest of the accompanying illustrations, viz.\r\nthe tongue of a Jamaica boa of about 8 feet long. It was cut out and\r\ngiven me immediately after the death of the reptile, and while soft\r\nand flexible was carefully copied. The hair-like points diminish to an\r\nalmost invisible fineness impossible to represent with pen or pencil.\r\nThe _slender_ little tongue is that of the young _Jararaca_; and the\r\nshortest is that of the African viperling. I have drawn only as much as\r\nis usually exserted when in use. The entire tongues are much longer,\r\nof a pale flesh tint, and somewhat thicker towards the root. It is\r\nobservable that the organs, like their possessors, are either shorter\r\nand stouter, or longer and more slender.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three tongues from nature (exact size).]\r\n\r\nThe reader will concur with Mr. P. H. Gosse and the _Penny Cyclopedia_,\r\nthat ‘no instrument is less adapted for licking.’\r\n\r\nThere is yet one more of our English scientific writers who must be\r\nquoted, and who, though he wrote so far back as 1834, shows us that\r\neven then this tongue was far better understood by the French and\r\nGerman zoologists than ourselves. Roget, in his _Animal Physiology_\r\n(one of the Bridgewater Treatises), says: ‘Hellmann has shown us that\r\nthe slender, bifurcated tongue of snakes is used for the purposes of\r\ntouch.’\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that we have no translation of this and of\r\nseveral other German ophiologists of whom mention is made by Roget and\r\nothers. Lenz gives us to understand that in 1817 Hellmann had decided\r\nthat a snake uses its tongue as an insect does its antennæ. And in\r\nwatching with unprejudiced eyes the varying play of the organ, the\r\nsimilarity of action will at once be recognised.\r\n\r\nAfter all, how little can we ever know of these organs beyond\r\nconjecture! Who shall say whether each or both may not possess a\r\nsense of which we ourselves have no true perception? Close observers\r\nare convinced that the tongue of a snake is endowed with peculiar\r\nsensibilities; and it is the more astonishing, therefore, that reason\r\nand observation have so long been blinded and enslaved by prejudice\r\nregarding it.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists think that the sense of smell lies in antennæ. The\r\nsense of smell itself is dull in snakes; yet they have means of\r\nascertaining what other animals learn by smell. Says Huxley, ‘The\r\ngreat majority of the sensations we call taste are in reality complex\r\nsensations, into which smell and even touch largely enter.’[34] It is\r\ncertain that the snake’s tongue is in constant use for some purpose or\r\nother, though beyond what we see of its form and actions we can only\r\nspeculate, or, at best, draw conclusions from observation.\r\n\r\nBoth Dumeril and Lenz give the result of their own observations. The\r\nformer, however, devotes so many pages to the tongue and its functions\r\nunder the various headings of ‘touch,’ ‘nutrition,’ ‘the senses,’ etc.,\r\nthat it will be necessary to curtail a good deal, particularly as this\r\ngreat author has been quoted by those other physiologists whose words\r\nwere given above. Of the sheath into which the tongue is received he\r\nsays:—‘Une gaîne cylindrique, charnue; mais l’extrémité de cette\r\nlangue est fourchue, ou divisée en deux pointes mobiles, vibrantes,\r\nsusceptible de se mouvoir indépendamment l’une de l’autre, de s’écarter\r\net d’être lancées, pour ainsi dire: ce que la fait regarder par le\r\nvulgaire comme une sorte de darte, auquel même quelques peintres ont\r\ndonné dans leurs tableaux la forme d’un fer de flêche. Le vrai est que\r\ncette langue est molle, humide, très faible, et que l’on a fait des\r\nconjectures, plutôt sur les usages auquels on l’a cru destinée, que\r\nsur l’utilité réelle dont elle peut être aux serpents dans l’acte de\r\nla deglutition; car les serpents ne mâchent jamais leurs alimens.’[35]\r\n‘Quoiqu’on ignore le véritable usage de la langue humide et charnue que\r\nles serpents brandissent et font continuellement sortir de la bouche\r\net vibrer dans l’air, il est facile de concevoir qu’à cause de la\r\nforme cylindrique et de son etroitesse elle ne pourrait faciliter la\r\nmastication, quand même les dents seraient propres de cet usage.’[36]\r\n\r\nThis first volume of _Erpétologie générale_ treats of all reptiles\r\ninclusively; but in the sixth volume, where the _ophidia_ particularly\r\nare introduced, the tongue is, with the rest of the organs, more\r\nminutely described. Some repetition necessarily occurs; but there is\r\nstill a good deal that will repay perusal.\r\n\r\nAfter stating that in serpents the sense of touch is dull, on account\r\nof the integument, and the absence of what may be regarded as tactile\r\norgans, and that the sense of smell is dull, the nostrils being feebly\r\ndeveloped, Dumeril adds: ‘The tongue, though fleshy, very mobile, and\r\nconstantly moist, is rather an especial instrument for touch, for the\r\naction of lapping, and for other functions, than to perceive the nature\r\nof liquids;’ in other words, than as an organ of _taste_. ‘It is,\r\nhowever, very remarkable; though smooth and even above, it is furnished\r\nwith little fringes or papillæ along the sides. Notwithstanding its\r\nlength and narrowness, it is singularly protractile and retractile; and\r\nin its exceedingly rapid vibrations has impressed the vulgar with the\r\nidea that it is formed with the two spear-like points. It is clothed\r\nwith a delicate skin.’[37]\r\n\r\nLenz made many interesting experiments. In his work he gives us the\r\nresult of these, and also what some other German ophiologists had seen\r\nand done. He observed how entirely the snake trusted to its tongue\r\nin any unusual circumstances; the all-important member was then in\r\nceaseless activity. Confined in a glass jar containing wine or any\r\nliquid that the snake did not like, the tongue was ever agitated.\r\nCrawling up the side, the tongue was in constant request to feel the\r\nglass (as may be often seen at the Zoological Gardens); and on arriving\r\nat the top, the head was turned this way and that, and then bent over\r\nthe edge, as if to make certain that no further obstacle existed; the\r\ntongue not for one instant quiet, but exserted sometimes as far forward\r\nas the whole length of the head, telling to its owner all that the\r\nother senses could not discover.\r\n\r\nPermitting it to touch his hand, he felt it like the sweep of a thread,\r\nso light and delicate. Too fine and flexible to injure any surface, the\r\nslightest touch of one or both the tips suffices for intelligence. Nay,\r\nsometimes without even touching—that is, without positive contact, but\r\nby some subtle sense, it seems to act as guide.\r\n\r\nWhen the snake is excited by fear or alarm, or when in a strange place,\r\nthe activity of the tongue is so great, the vibrations are so rapid,\r\nthat the eye cannot follow them. It is like the play of electricity.\r\n\r\nSo far from participating in deglutition, the snake withdraws the\r\nslender instrument into its sheath, which, while feeding, is safely\r\nclosed. For this highly-endowed organ is so guarded against injury,\r\nthat the reptile has not only a place of safety provided, but power\r\nto close the mouth of its scabbard, lest dust or other irritating\r\nparticles should enter.\r\n\r\nWe have only to reflect upon and to observe the habits of snakes to\r\nperceive the importance of their tongue to them. For the most part\r\nnocturnal, winding their way under tangled masses of vegetation, often\r\nin dark caves, holes, crevices, and obscure retreats, with their eyes\r\nso placed that they can see neither before nor under them, and with\r\nother senses only feebly developed, the tongue with its sensitive\r\npapillæ feels its way, and conveys impressions to its owner.\r\n\r\nCats have their whiskers to help them in the dark; moles and mice have\r\ntheir quick sense of smell to guide them; all nocturnal animals are\r\ngifted in some manner or another, but snakes have only their tongue.\r\n\r\nWe can now imagine the helpless condition of the reptile if deprived of\r\nthe tongue! Rudolph Effeldt, of whom Lenz speaks as the ‘most eminent\r\nobserver of living snakes,’ found that when deprived of the tongue,\r\nthey would neither eat nor drink, and, of course, died after a while.\r\nBut Lenz had some snakes sent him which had been deprived of their\r\ntongues, and he observed that though for a time dull and declining,\r\nthey did recover, and by and by ate as usual. From which we can only\r\nconclude that snakes, like other animals, differ in their powers of\r\nendurance. Some survive mutilation and suffering, some do not.\r\n\r\nAnother error in illustrations is to represent the tongue far extended\r\nwhile the mouth is wide open. Snakes very rarely open their mouths and\r\nuse their tongues at the same time. Indeed, excepting to gape, the\r\nsnake does _not_ generally open its mouth; nor invariably keep it open\r\nwhile advancing on its prey, as illustrations often represent.\r\n\r\nNature has further provided for the safety of the tongue by leaving a\r\nsmall opening in the upper lip, or at the point of the muzzle, just\r\nwhere no teeth are in the way, so that the snake can use its tongue\r\nwithout exposing the sheath and mouth to injury. This ‘chink in the\r\nrostral shield,’ to use technical language, permits the free exit of\r\nthe tongue and the independent actions of the two muscles of which\r\nit is formed, enabling the reptile to hold the two fine tips close\r\ntogether as one tip, while passing the tongue through the narrow chink,\r\nand to expand them afterwards.\r\n\r\nLenz never observed any dust or small particles adhering to the tongue;\r\nbut Mr. Arthur Nicols, the author of _Zoological Notes_, informs me\r\nthat he _has_ noticed little fragments of rubbish cling to the tongue\r\nand carried into the mouth. Dr. Cantor also says: ‘Sea snakes make no\r\nuse of the tongue while _in_ the water, but considerable use of it as\r\na feeler when out of the water.’ He has noticed ‘several Indian land\r\nsnakes use it to bring into the mouth various small bodies, as stones,\r\nsand, twigs, which they swallow to stimulate digestion.’\r\n\r\nThis is curious and noteworthy. The power or volition which can control\r\nthe sheath and close the valve can, no doubt, exclude these foreign\r\nparticles; as, while lapping, the mouth must be moistened as well as\r\nthe interior of the sheath, both it and the tongue requiring frequent\r\nlubrication.\r\n\r\nBut we have now reached the confines of speculation. There is enough of\r\nreal fact about this ‘horrid forked tongue’ to interest and astonish\r\nus. We find it guarded, aided, especially provided for, and especially\r\nconstructed and endowed; especially _harmless_ also. To the owner its\r\nimportance ranks not second even to the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the antennæ to insects is evident to all who have\r\never watched the play of those active and beautifully-elaborate organs,\r\ntheir infinitely varying forms (often many times the length of the\r\ninsect itself), their ceaseless play and independent action. Constantly\r\nwaving, they lightly touch every contiguous object; investigating on\r\nall sides, they convey to insect intelligence all it requires to know\r\nregarding its environments. Like a herald or a scout, they literally\r\n‘spy out the land,’ and thus become a guide and a guard to the tiny\r\nfeeble creature which possesses them. Through them the owner learns all\r\nthat is needful for its well-being.\r\n\r\nMuch as an insect uses these exquisitely-constructed antennæ, so does\r\na snake its long, slender, pliant, bifurcate, and highly-sensitive\r\ntongue. Ever busy, ever vigilant, exploring while barely touching each\r\nsurface within reach, yet by night and by day conveying with that\r\nslight contact all necessary information to its owner. Sent out with\r\nthe speed of a flash, it telegraphs back with like quickness the result\r\nof its discoveries.\r\n\r\nIf we may assign intelligence to any single organ, we might affirm that\r\nthere is more of what we consider rational intelligence in the tongue\r\nof a snake than in any other of its perceptive faculties. Probably the\r\nmost important knowledge demanded by the reptile is conveyed, or, at\r\nleast, confirmed by this organ.\r\n\r\n‘_Colorée_,’ says Dumeril of the tongue, as botanists say of the part\r\nof a plant ordinarily green, as, for instance, a calyx; ‘coloured,’ but\r\nnot what colour. This is precisely as we may describe the colour of a\r\nsnake’s tongue. My attention was first drawn to this on reading one of\r\nDr. Arthur Stradling’s communications to _Land and Water_, April 2,\r\n1881. ‘It would be interesting to know why some snakes have red tongues\r\nand others black,’ he writes. ‘Here beside me, in a glass case, are two\r\nlittle snakes, both belonging to the same genus (_Tropidonotus_)—a\r\nseven-banded (_T. leberis_), and a moccasin (_T. fasciatus_), both\r\nhailing from the United States, and both alike in their habits and\r\nchoice of food; yet it is a case of _rouge et noir_ with their lingual\r\nappendages.’\r\n\r\nAfter reading this, I noticed the varieties of colour in all the\r\n‘forked tongues’ that exhibited themselves at the Zoological Gardens.\r\nBlack or very dark tongues, I think, predominate; and next to black,\r\nbrownish or olive tints, resembling those of the snake itself. But\r\nnot as a rule; for some very light snakes have dark tongues, and the\r\nconverse. In two small green tree snakes of distinct genera, one had\r\na pale pink or flesh-coloured tongue, and the other a black one. Some\r\ntongues are almost white, while a few are red. There seems to be as\r\nmuch caprice as in the colour of the human hair and eyes; and as\r\nphysiologists have traced some sort of connection or relationship with\r\ncomplexions and constitutions in these, so ophiologists may, after a\r\ntime, discover a similar relation or sympathy between the colour of a\r\nsnake’s tongue and its integument or eyes. At present, I have observed\r\nonly so far as that two entirely black and two entirely green snakes\r\nmay present four distinct colours as regards their four tongues, and\r\nthat many tints of brown, black, and pink may be seen in the tongues of\r\nas many snakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n_THE GLOTTIS._\r\n\r\n\r\nONE Friday in august 1873, while watching a large python, at the\r\nZoological Gardens, swallowing a duck which it had just killed, I was\r\nstruck by a singular something projecting or hanging from the side of\r\nthe snake’s mouth. It looked like a kind of tube or pipe, about one\r\ninch and a half or two inches of which were visible. The python had\r\nrather an awkward hold of the duck, having begun at the breast with the\r\nneck doubled back, the head forming some temporary impediment to the\r\nprogress of the jaws upon the prey. So the strange protuberance gave\r\none a ‘sort of turn,’ and a shudder. It looked as if it might be some\r\npart of the crushed bird, and then again it had the appearance of some\r\ninternal arrangement; and another shudder crept over one as the idea\r\nsuggested itself that the poor snake had ruptured its throat in some\r\nway. What _could_ this queer thing be, hanging on one side, as you see\r\nthe tongue of a horse or dog sometimes lolling sideways over its lower\r\njaw? While intently pondering and observing this strange tube-like\r\nobject, in size somewhat as big as the edge of a thimble, I saw the\r\nend of it moving of itself, an orifice contracting and closing tight,\r\nby the loose skin puckering up, so to speak. Presently it opened, and\r\nby and by again closed tight, as you see the breathing orifice of the\r\noctopus contract and expand, open and close, at regular intervals, only\r\nin the present case the intervals were not regular. This strange tube,\r\nthen, had life and volition in it! What could it be?\r\n\r\nSuddenly a certain day of one’s childhood flashed into my mind, and a\r\ncertain scene of home. One Michaelmas Day it was, when, having stolen\r\nsurreptitiously into the kitchen to coax the cook to ‘_let_ me see\r\nthe goose!’ I found her busy preparing the bird, and clambered into a\r\nchair to watch her. ‘What’s _that_?’ I demanded, seeing part of a long,\r\npipe-like looking thing lying there.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, that’s the windpipe. That’s like what _you’ve_ got in _your_\r\nthroat; and that’s where the crumbs get to make you choke so,’ in\r\nallusion to a recent occurrence.\r\n\r\nI gazed with awe and interest at that very strange thing, and wondered\r\nif it really could be like anything in my own throat, and where it\r\nbegan and ended, and so on. And that goose’s windpipe was indelibly\r\nstamped on my memory.\r\n\r\nAnd now that scene came vividly back to me, for there was a windpipe\r\nsort of look about this appendage to the snake’s jaw, only it did not\r\nappear to be bruised or injured in any way. Nor from the position of\r\nthe duck (by this time half swallowed) could it belong to the bird.\r\nAnd, again, it moved with an independent motion!\r\n\r\nAnd now the snake threw up its head, to free the legs of the duck from\r\nits folds where it had been held, and as you see horses toss up their\r\nheads to get the grain in the bag hung on their noses, and I saw the\r\ntube-like object still more plainly. Then, with a strange, awe-struck\r\nfeeling, came a conviction that this could be nothing less than the\r\npoor snake’s windpipe, and that something must be very wrong with it.\r\n\r\nI beckoned to the keeper, and pointed to it, telling him, ‘I do think\r\nthat must be its windpipe. Is it hurt?’\r\n\r\nThe keeper said, ‘No, the snake was not hurt. That he had often seen\r\nit like that when the snakes were feeding; and that he also thought it\r\nmust be the windpipe, to enable the snake to breathe while feeding.’\r\n\r\nNext day, with eager steps and excited curiosity, I hurried to the\r\nBritish Museum reading-room, thinking I had made a wonderful discovery,\r\nfor I had never heard this strange phenomenon alluded to, and the\r\nkeeper evidently knew very little about it.\r\n\r\nWith this great secret on my mind, I flew to the well-known shelves, to\r\nsecure those books which would certainly enlighten me if information\r\nwere to be had. Alas! for my wonderful discovery, though it really had\r\nbeen a portion of the windpipe which was thus extended from the mouth,\r\nit was what had been known long ago by those physiologists who had\r\nstudied the anatomy of the ophidia, and it was as coolly described as\r\nif it were the commonest occurrence in the world for creatures to do\r\nwhat they pleased with their windpipe!\r\n\r\nSays Professor Owen in his _Anatomy of the Vertebrates_, vol. i. p.\r\n525: ‘The glottis of serpents can be drawn forward and protruded\r\nfrom the mouth by the action of’ (certain surrounding) ‘muscles. In\r\nmarine serpents the glottis is situated very near the fore part of the\r\nmouth, and the air can be inspired at the surface of the water without\r\nexposure of the jaws.’\r\n\r\nThe lungs of snakes, then, are supplied with air through that moveable\r\ntube, and the ‘glottis,’ which is the mouth or opening of what may here\r\nbe called the air-tube, not to venture on scientific terms, was what I\r\nhad seen ‘puckered up,’ as it appeared.\r\n\r\nWe may briefly remind the reader that our own throats contain two\r\npassages, one to the lungs, the other to the stomach; and in order that\r\nthe air passage may be safely guarded from the entrance of any foreign\r\nparticles, there are various parts, valves, and muscles which come\r\ninto play with the action of swallowing, each and all having technical\r\nnames, larynx, pharynx, glottis, epiglottis, etc., which need not be\r\nhere described. But in the adaptive development of those wonderful\r\ncreatures, snakes, the entrance or mouth of the windpipe—which begins\r\n_in_ their mouth—can not only be closed at will, but still further to\r\nprotect the passage, and also to enable the reptiles to breathe during\r\nthe long process of swallowing, they can absolutely bring the apparatus\r\nforward, even _beyond_ their mouths; and this was what had so surprised\r\nme on witnessing it.\r\n\r\nThe glottis, being the soft, membranous end or aperture, was what\r\nopened and closed, expanded and contracted, by that sort of puckering\r\nup and loosening again that was observable, and which here was rounded,\r\nbut in the higher animals is a narrow, lip-like slit.\r\n\r\nSome physiologists, in describing this ‘air-tube’ of serpents, speak\r\nof it as the _larynx_, which is what we unscientific folk would call\r\nthe entrance to, or the upper portion of, the true windpipe or trachea.\r\nOthers, again, affirm that they saw the ‘windpipe’ projecting. After\r\nall, much less has been said about it than one could wish; and what\r\nis said is somewhat conflicting, perhaps on account of the obscurity\r\nconnected with this surprising adaptation of means to necessities.\r\nA thorough examination of the position of the trachea of snakes\r\n_while feeding_, and a perfect realization of its functions, could\r\nonly be obtained were it possible to arrest the process of feeding\r\nby the instantaneous death of the feeder, and while every muscle of\r\nthe snake’s mouth remained in position. Even then, one could not be\r\npositive, as snakes are endowed with the astonishing power of carrying\r\nout their intentions, or, in common language, ‘going on with their\r\nbusiness,’ even after death. That is to say, owing to the irritability\r\nof their muscles, the action which they were about to perform (as,\r\nfor instance, springing at a foe) continues should the head be shot\r\noff at the moment of making the attempt. In p. 56 and chap. xxi. some\r\nremarkable elucidations of this are given.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of a windpipe is familiar to every one. It\r\nis formed of a series of rings or hoops, partially cartilaginous in\r\nmammals; that is to say, they are incomplete behind, where their\r\nends are united by muscle and membrane, and come in contact with the\r\ngullet; but in serpents the rings are entire, the ends of each being\r\njoined together by an elastic substance. The rings themselves are\r\nalso connected with each other by elastic membranes, so that the\r\nwindpipe is capable of being extended like an india-rubber tube, and of\r\nregaining its former position.\r\n\r\nThe length of it naturally varies according to the size and species\r\nof serpent; but as a rule it is always much longer comparatively than\r\nin man. In a full-sized rattlesnake, the trachea is about twenty\r\ninches long. In a boa constrictor, also, though a much larger snake,\r\nit measures about the same. In smaller snakes it is, of course, much\r\nshorter; but there is the same singular diversity in this as we find in\r\nother serpent anomalies, viz. a great variation in the length in snakes\r\nof equal size, and without any very apparent reason.\r\n\r\nBingley, in his _Animal Biography_, 1820, describes the appearance of\r\na large snake (M’Leod’s celebrated boa) when gorging a goat; but the\r\naccount, like those of that time, is more sensational than scientific.\r\n‘His cheeks were immensely dilated, and appeared to be bursting, and\r\nhis _windpipe_ projected three inches beyond his jaws.’\r\n\r\nBroderip, a few years later, 1825, more lucidly and dispassionately\r\ndescribes what he had observed. ‘I have uniformly found that the larynx\r\nis, during the operation of swallowing, protruded sometimes as much as\r\na quarter of an inch beyond the edge of the dilated lower jaw. I have\r\nseen, in company with others, the valves of the glottis open and shut,\r\nand the dead rabbit’s fur immediately before the aperture stirred,\r\napparently by the serpent’s breath, when his jaws and throat were\r\nstiff, and stretched to excess’ (_Zoological Journal_, ii. 1826). This\r\naccount is quoted from the paper entitled, ‘Some Account of the Mode in\r\nwhich the Boa Constrictor takes its Prey, and of the Adaptation of its\r\nOrganization to its Habits,’ by W. J. Broderip, Esq., F.L.S. The paper\r\nwas written as a criticism of the M’Leod story.\r\n\r\nI, also, on several occasions, saw the fur or feathers stirred by\r\nair when the mouth or valve opened of what we may safely call the\r\n_air-tube_, whether larynx or trachea.\r\n\r\nThough so rarely mentioned in popular books on snakes, this\r\nsurprising modification of the breathing apparatus was described by\r\nthe indefatigable Dr. Edward Tyson, on his dissection of the first\r\nrattlesnake that fell into the hands of the Royal Society, 1683, and\r\nwhose paper on the _Vipera caudisona_, as he named it, is quoted in\r\nchapters xvi. and xx. ‘Over the tongue did lye the _larynx_, not formed\r\nwith that variety of cartilages as is usual in other animals, but so as\r\nto make a rime or slit for receiving or conveying out the air. Nor was\r\nthere any epiglottis for preventing other bodies from slipping in, this\r\nbeing sufficiently provided for by the strict closure of it.’[38]\r\n\r\nDr. Tyson examined only a dead specimen, and could not therefore\r\nwitness the action observable in life; but his remarkable accuracy in\r\ndescribing the parts will be evident in comparing what he said with\r\nDumeril, who did observe the living reptiles. The confusion which\r\nsometimes occurs in distinguishing the parts may be also explained by\r\nthe less complicated structure of the tube, which in higher animals\r\npresents the nicer distinctions of the parts, glottis, epiglottis,\r\nlarynx, etc.\r\n\r\n‘Il n’y a pas de véritable larynx, une petite languette mobile qui\r\ns’ajuste, sur l’ouverture linéaire; c’est la glotte.... La glotte,\r\nsituée au-dessous de la victime, se porte en avant, et l’acte de\r\nrespiration ne se trouve point empêché. C’est que nous avons indiqué à\r\nl’article de la déglutition; car on voit distinctement alors la glotte\r\nse fermer et se délater.’[39]\r\n\r\nThis _petite languette_ became a new object of curiosity, and soon\r\ncame fresh opportunities for observation, namely, when some of the\r\nlarger snakes were engaged in yawning. On account of its extreme\r\nmobility, you do not always detect the form of this little point on\r\nthe upper lip, which as often as not presents a rounded opening; but\r\noccasionally the little tongue—which can be nothing but an apology for\r\nan epiglottis—is very distinct, and may be compared with the moveable,\r\npointed snout of some of the large pachyderms, or, still better, with\r\nan exactly similar formation at the end of the elephant’s trunk, and\r\nwhich, though for a different purpose, moves similarly.\r\n\r\nAs to the _exact position_ of this glottis when at rest, a word or two\r\nmust be said; for a number of prepositions have been used to describe\r\nit. One writer says ‘beneath’ the tongue sheath, others say ‘beyond,’\r\nothers again ‘before;’ ‘over,’ ‘above,’ ‘behind,’ ‘in front of,’ have\r\nbeen variously used, and all depending on which way the snake is\r\nviewed; but without drawing upon half a score of prepositions to puzzle\r\nthe reader, as I myself was sorely puzzled until a yawning snake was so\r\nkind as to afford me an ocular scrutiny of its lingual arrangements, we\r\ncan easily comprehend where a passage to the windpipe and lungs must\r\nnecessarily be, and which, it is clear, is not _under_ the tongue.\r\nWhen a snake’s head is raised, as in crawling up a wall or a tree,\r\nthe glottis may be said to be ‘beneath’ or ‘under;’ but the general\r\nposition of a snake being horizontal, the mouth then opened would show\r\nyou the opening of the tongue sheath _nearest_ to you and to the front;\r\nand beyond that, behind, over, or _upon_ the tongue sheath, is another\r\naperture, which is the glottis or entrance to the larynx and trachea or\r\nwindpipe.\r\n\r\nSo there are in fact two sheaths or tubes lying one upon the other,\r\nviz. the tongue sheath, and upon this and parallel with it, the\r\nwindpipe.\r\n\r\nAfter becoming better acquainted with the nature of that tube which\r\nhad impressed me so strangely, I lost no opportunity of making further\r\nobservations, and on the following feeding day at the Gardens I saw the\r\nair-tubes of several snakes plainly. In September of that year, a new\r\n‘Horseshoe’ snake (_Zamenis hippocrepis_) arrived from Morocco. It was\r\na small and very pretty snake, and while enjoying the privilege of a\r\nprivate inspection, the keeper got its mouth open for me, enabling me\r\nto see the glottis, as well as to both see and _feel_ the four upper\r\nrows of its beautiful little teeth, closely placed, and as sharp as\r\nthe finest pins. But the action of the air-tube was very distinct.\r\nProbably little _Zamenis_ was breathing harder and nervously under the\r\ndetention, but no word better describes the formation of the aperture\r\nof the perfectly rounded tube, and the movement of it, than the _petite\r\nlanguette_.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, there were opportunities of observing the air-tube in\r\ntwo of the large African vipers, the ‘River Jack’ or ‘Nose-horned’\r\nvipers (_Vipera rhinosceros_) occupying the same cage. Each struck a\r\nguinea-pig and held it. One of them began to eat his before it was\r\nquite dead, and had finished it before his friend had begun. In his\r\ncase, the air-pipe was at the side of his distended jaws. In the other,\r\nit projected more than half an inch _beneath_, nearly in the centre.\r\n\r\nThis happened on a mild, damp day in November 1873, and after that\r\nI saw the tube in ‘several snakes,’ but I regret the names were not\r\nentered in my notebook at the time. In the smaller non-venomous snakes,\r\nor in the lacertines—of which there were then a large number—I do\r\nnot remember to have observed it. They despatch their frog or mouse so\r\nquickly that they would scarcely need a fresh supply of air meanwhile.\r\nIn the larger vipers, rattlesnakes, and constrictors, the air-tube\r\nwas undoubtedly witnessed. Winter then terminated my observations,\r\nand afterwards a prolonged absence from town. Unfortunately, when\r\nobservations were about to be resumed, the change of the plans at\r\nthe Zoological Gardens, and the exclusion of the public, defeated my\r\nintentions, though on one occasion I did see the windpipe of little\r\n_Natrix torquata_ very distinctly; and this was the smallest snake in\r\nwhich I had ever observed it. _Natrix_ had nearly disposed of a large\r\nfrog. The whole of it was in his mouth, which was widely expanded,\r\nand the air-tube was protruded sideways, not _out_ of the mouth, but\r\nsufficiently forward to enable one to distinguish its form, and the\r\naction of the _petite languette_. The prey being unusually large, the\r\nsnake had needed air while swallowing it.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions in snakes recently dead, and of various sizes, one\r\nhas been able to notice how admirably this tube, which lies along the\r\nmouth like a soft cushion, somewhat in the form of a parrot’s tongue,\r\nis supplied with space in the roof, arched to fit it, the palate teeth\r\nenclosing it on each side, while the opening, or glottis, exactly meets\r\nthe nostrils, _les arrières nez_, bringing it into communication with\r\nthe outer air.\r\n\r\nIn a little _Coluber_, just dead, I again had an opportunity of making\r\nobservations. The membranous coating was so thin and transparent that\r\nthe rings of the windpipe could be very distinctly traced from a quite\r\nforward position in the mouth, and beginning on and over the tongue\r\nsheath. The surrounding skin or membrane was also loose and abundant,\r\nso that with the point of a needle the upper part of the windpipe could\r\nbe easily drawn forward _beyond_ the lips. In life the little snake\r\ncould thus have voluntarily protruded it as occasion required.\r\n\r\nAnother day the large reticulated python seemed to intentionally\r\ngratify my curiosity by affording me a most leisurely and excellent\r\nopportunity for observation. His head was raised, and so close to the\r\nglass that the process of swallowing could be watched conveniently.\r\nThe final swallow, or successive efforts at the last were, as usual,\r\nattended with frequent yawns. The glottis, as could on these occasions\r\nbe distinctly seen, was repeatedly opened and closed, and after being\r\nextended beyond the mouth, it gradually resumed its natural position.\r\nWhile the prey occupied the entire space between the gaping jaws, one\r\ncould see the air-tube pushed forward _beneath_; but as by degrees\r\nthe duck disappeared down the throat, the interior of the mouth could\r\nbe better and better observed. In this large snake the membrane or\r\nskin was too thick to enable one to discern rings as in the little\r\n_Coluber_; but as the larynx is merely the upper part of the trachea,\r\nand as the glottis is the mere membranous opening to the larynx, it\r\nseems evident that the windpipe itself is also extensible, the windpipe\r\nbeing, indeed, the only portion of the air-tube sufficiently firm and\r\nresisting to aid the purpose of respiration under such conditions.\r\n\r\nThe exact distance which the tube is extended cannot be accurately\r\nstated. It would not be equally protruded in snakes of different sizes\r\nnor under different conditions. Broderip saw it ‘as much as a quarter\r\nof an inch.’ Bingley, an earlier and a less safe authority, says ‘the\r\nwindpipe projected _three inches_ beyond his jaws.’ The keeper at the\r\nGardens thought he had sometimes seen it ‘as much as two inches in the\r\nlargest snakes;’ and my own impression was, one inch, at least, in the\r\npython, and almost that in the large vipers.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly one of those interesting features worthy of further\r\ninvestigation, and one is surprised that more accurate information\r\nregarding it has not appeared in our later encyclopedias and in the\r\n‘Proceedings of the Zoological Societies.’\r\n\r\nSo long ago as 1826, it was observed and confirmed by the distinguished\r\nauthor of _Zoological Researches_, and _Leaves from the Notebook of\r\na Naturalist_. The author of _British Reptiles_, who conducted the\r\n_Zoological Journal_ when Mr. Broderip contributed the valuable paper\r\nabove quoted, added a note by special request, stating that his own\r\n‘not unfrequent observations have on every point been completely\r\nconfirmatory of those above recorded’ by W. J. Broderip, Esq.\r\n\r\nA very good account of the whole is quoted in the _Penny Magazine_,\r\n1836, and we are therein further enlightened by reading that Joseph\r\nHenry Green, Esq., F.R.S., in one of his lectures at the Royal College\r\nof Surgeons, alluded to Broderip’s paper ‘On the Mode in which\r\nConstrictors swallow their Prey,’ and which had drawn his attention to\r\nthe statement about the larynx, and led him to examine the mouth of a\r\nsnake.\r\n\r\nIn process of dissection, he detected two muscles in the lower jaw,\r\nevidently intended for the purpose of bringing the larynx forward; how\r\nfar forward and how much of the true windpipe was also brought forward,\r\nhe did not say. But this in a dead specimen could scarcely be affirmed\r\nwith certainty.\r\n\r\nFrom the large size of their prey, and the jaws being stretched\r\nopen and gorged to their utmost capacity, it is plain that snakes\r\ncannot breathe freely in the ordinary manner while feeding, a process\r\nsometimes of an hour or more. Owing to the construction of their lungs\r\nand their capability to contain a large volume of air, they do not\r\nrequire to breathe frequently; still they do occasionally take a fresh\r\ninspiration, and their needs are met by this wonderful arrangement of\r\nthe breathing apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n_BREATHING AND HISSING OF SNAKES._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLLOWING on the subject of the last chapter comes that of respiration;\r\nand in connection with breathing is the ‘voice,’ so far as this class\r\nof animals can be said to possess a voice.\r\n\r\nAs already seen in the description of the glottis, serpents do not\r\nbreathe in the ordinary way, with short and regular inspirations, but\r\nwhen they do respire, they take in a supply of air to last them for\r\nsome time. Their lungs, instead of occupying one particular portion of\r\nthe body corresponding with the chest of the higher animals, are less\r\ndeveloped. One lung—or what Professor Owen calls the long pulmonary\r\nbag—of snakes extends along more than half of their body; in some\r\nspecies nearly to the anus. Only one lung is normal, the other is\r\nrudimentary. The circulation is so arranged that on each contraction\r\nof the heart only a part of the blood is exposed to the influence of\r\nthe air and becomes oxygenated, the rest returning to the parts without\r\nhaving undergone the action of respiration at all. The blood is, in\r\nconsequence, poor in red corpuscles, its circulation is comparatively\r\nlanguid, the reptile becomes easily torpid, and its temperature is\r\ninfluenced by the surrounding atmosphere more than by the vigour of its\r\nown functions. This is why, when not excited to activity by external\r\nwarmth, reptiles can pass a long time without food. Having no fixed\r\ntemperature to maintain, one important source of demand for food is\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe air enters their lungs chiefly in a direct course from the\r\nnostrils, only by the mouth when open. If you observe the flatness of\r\nthe head, and the very short space that can exist between the nose and\r\nthe mouth of snakes, you will readily trace the communication between\r\nthe entrance to the trachea and the outer air through the nostrils\r\nwhen the glottis is not closed. Professor Owen, in his _Anatomy of\r\nthe Vertebrates_, vol. i. p. 528, describes this process fully. In\r\nthe foregoing description I have borrowed from him, as well as from\r\nDr. Carpenter, Todd, and others; but as there is nothing like ‘seeing\r\nfor oneself,’ I would persuade my readers to watch a snake for a few\r\nminutes. An inspiration at intervals will be easily discerned by the\r\nexpansion of the body. You will also perceive partial or slighter\r\nbreathings, and the trunk dilating and expanding gently through a sort\r\nof internal respiration which is going on; every now and then comes the\r\ndeeper, fuller breath.\r\n\r\nYou may perceive that sometimes one short portion of the body expands,\r\nas if the lung in that part only were at work. This is more easily seen\r\nin the larger snakes. I have watched these for a quarter of an hour or\r\nmore at a time, during which period only a comparatively short portion\r\nof the body showed any signs of breathing. Schlegel, who carefully\r\nstudied this action, observed sometimes as many as thirty such partial\r\ndilatations of the trunk and lung between two full inspirations.\r\n\r\nIn the large reticulated python I once saw that about two feet of the\r\nbody, viz. four to six feet from the head, dilated with occasional and\r\nirregular inspirations, and no other part. By and by slight indications\r\nof breathing were observable much lower down, many feet apart from\r\nthe previous action, while during the whole time I was watching I saw\r\nnot one full and entire inflation of the lungs. This was on a rather\r\nchilly September afternoon, and the python had partaken of a couple of\r\nducks for dinner the previous day, and it was a time when inactivity is\r\nusual. In a rattlesnake, on the same day, similar partial and irregular\r\nrespirations were observable, this serpent having caused four rats to\r\ndisappear at his last night’s supper.\r\n\r\nSometimes you can discern no indication whatever of breathing for a\r\nvery long time. When the reptiles are not in health, when they are\r\nabout to cast their skin, or when in a half-torpid condition, you may\r\nobserve this.\r\n\r\nWhen a snake yawns—a long and leisurely proceeding—the lungs are\r\ndoubtless greatly refreshed; otherwise these reptiles do not rest with\r\ntheir mouths open, and the only possible access of outer air by the\r\nlips being through the chink appropriated to the service of the tongue\r\n(and which is as exactly opposite the opening of the tongue-sheath as\r\nthe nostrils are opposite to the glottis), they must breathe almost\r\nentirely through the nose, _except when yawning_.\r\n\r\nFrom the elongated form of the pulmonary bag, and the large volume\r\nof air which it contains, we can understand not only how a temporary\r\nsuspension of respiration can be supported, but we comprehend how it is\r\nthat these reptiles can remain under water for long periods, as they\r\noften do,—not because they breathe _in_ the water, but because they\r\ncan for a while do without breathing.\r\n\r\nSnakes have been seen to remain perfectly quiet at the bottom of a\r\nclear stream for half an hour or more. Sometimes in this totally\r\nquiescent state one has been supposed to be dead, until, on a stone\r\nbeing thrown, it has darted away like a fish. None of the aquatic birds\r\nor the cetaceous mammalia can remain so long under water without coming\r\nto the surface to breathe as serpents can.\r\n\r\nAt the Zoological Gardens they remain for hours at a time in their\r\ntanks. Often you will see a head peeping out—which, unfortunately, is\r\nall we _can_ see—while the bath is being enjoyed, but as often the\r\nhead is also immersed, though, of course, for a shorter interval, the\r\nsnake lifting it to breathe occasionally.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine also the great assistance in swimming which this long\r\nair-receptacle must be, these reptiles deriving from it the same\r\nadvantage, says Professor Owen, ‘as an eel from its swim-bladder.’ In\r\nchap. XII. is described the almost swimming motion of the more active\r\nsnakes when gliding through long grass, or effecting progress over\r\na very smooth surface. In the water the action is similar—that is,\r\nthe progression is by lateral undulations, the tail being the chief\r\npropelling power. Whether through the resisting medium of water, or\r\nbeating the air, so to speak, when skimming over smooth or unresisting\r\nsurfaces, this swimming motion is ever easy and graceful. In the\r\nchapter on Tails, we shall see what an important agent in progression\r\nis this limb, whether by pressure, as in the burrowing snakes, or by\r\nits oar-like or paddle-like use in rapid motion.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate the above in a few words—first, respiration warms the\r\nblood; snakes are cold-blooded because only a portion of the blood\r\npasses through the lungs to become oxygenated, and in proportion to the\r\ndiminution of the quantity of blood transmitted to the lungs, so does\r\nrespiration become weaker; therefore reptiles are less dependent on\r\nbreathing.\r\n\r\nRegarding the ‘voice’ of serpents, so surprising are the qualities\r\nattributed to it, that one would imagine the existence of varieties of\r\nsnakes of widely differing organizations, if we were to believe all we\r\nread of the sounds they produce. ‘Hissing loudly,’ or ‘whistling,’ is\r\nthe rule. No ordinary writer or traveller who says a word about a snake\r\never heard it hiss anything but ‘loudly,’ a statement traceable to\r\nthe same sentiment which causes persons to talk of the ‘horrid forked\r\ntongue.’ A benevolently-disposed snake who would warn you away with\r\nthat terrible tongue would also strengthen his argument by a prolonged\r\nhiss, and the louder the better.\r\n\r\nBut let us turn to the hard, cold, unpoetical, unimaginative language\r\nof science, and see what a snake can really do in the vocal expression\r\nof its feelings.\r\n\r\nSays Dr. Carpenter: ‘In all air-breathing vertebrata the production\r\nof sound depends upon the passage of air through a certain portion\r\nof the respiratory tube, which is so constructed as to set the air\r\nin vibration. In reptiles and mammals it is at the point where the\r\nwindpipe opens into the front of the pharynx, that this vibrating\r\napparatus is situated. Few of the animals of the former class, however,\r\ncan produce any other sound than a _hiss_, occasioned by the passage of\r\nair through the narrow chink by which the trachea communicates with the\r\npharynx; but this sound, owing to the great capacity of their lungs, is\r\noften very much prolonged’ (_Animal Physiology_),—prolonged, but not\r\npowerful, be it observed.\r\n\r\nSays Professor Owen: ‘The true “_chordæ vocales_” are absent in\r\nserpents, and the voice is reduced to a hissing sound, produced by the\r\naction of the expired air upon the margins of the glottis’ (_Anatomy of\r\nthe Vertebrates_).\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the escape of air from the lungs, Dumeril says: ‘Lorsqu’il\r\nest passé plus vivement il laisse entendre une sorte de vibration, qui\r\nle plus souvent, ne consiste que dans le bruit d’un soufflement.’[40]\r\n\r\nSometimes, according to the position of a snake, or when the passage is\r\nwell open and uninterrupted, the hiss partakes somewhat of a whistling\r\nsound, like the blowing through a quill. I observed this particularly\r\nin a ‘tree boa’ (_Epicratis cenchris_), which hissed at me angrily one\r\nday because I took the liberty of touching it when the keeper opened\r\nits cage to arrange its blanket. The ‘hiss,’ not loud, or by any means\r\nmusical, differed from the ordinary blowing only as a current of\r\nair passing through a round tube would differ from the same current\r\npassing through a narrow slit. A true ‘hiss,’ such as we produce\r\nwith closed teeth in prolonging the sound of _s_, a serpent can never\r\nexpress. The nearest approach to it in the human voice is when the\r\ntongue is in the position as if we are about to say _ye_ or _he_, and\r\nthen prolong the breath; that is to say, breathe out while the tongue\r\nis so placed before the word is uttered.\r\n\r\nNaturally the larger the snake the stronger the ‘hiss;’ the more rapid\r\nthe expiration, the more powerful will be the volume of air with its\r\nattendant _soufflement_.\r\n\r\nThe sound and action, as well as degree, are easily seen in the ‘puff\r\nadder’ (_Clotho_, or _Vipera arietans_). When angry or alarmed, it\r\ndraws in a full breath, and its body swells perceptibly; then you hear\r\nthe escaping air like a prolonged sigh or blowing till the lungs are\r\nempty. This process is repeated as long as the provocation lasts.\r\n\r\nThese alternate inspirations and expirations, with their accompanying\r\nmovements, the swelling and then diminishing of the trunk and the\r\nregular _soufflants_, are so precisely like those of a pair of bellows,\r\nthat excepting in shape, we require no more complete comparison. The\r\n_degree_ or strength of hiss is in this reptile very perceptible. When\r\nrecently imported and easily excited, its violent ‘puffing’ corresponds\r\nwith a very large pair of bellows; but in time it grows less alarmed\r\nat the appearance of the human beings who unceremoniously stare at it;\r\nand at length the puffing is very slight, ceasing altogether after\r\nthe snake becomes accustomed to its surroundings. But if molested and\r\nalarmed, you then see the full play of the lungs, and the whole body\r\nalternately expanding and contracting as before.\r\n\r\nWe may almost compare this pulmonary action to the panting or full\r\nbreathings of ourselves under alarm or agitation. Only, in comparison\r\nas the lung of snakes is elongated, and there is so much of it to fill\r\nwith air, so is the sound prolonged, and the breathing a slower process.\r\n\r\nThere is another viper, the small Cape adder (_Vipera atropos_), a most\r\ndeadly little reptile, in which a similar sound to that of the ‘puff\r\nadder’ may be heard. When this creature is disturbed, it draws in a\r\nlong breath which expands its whole body in the same manner, and then\r\nin expelling the air, a long sort of wheeze or blowing is audible.\r\nEven in drawing the breath in, a slight sound is heard (as it also is\r\nin our native viper and some others); but instead of the prolonged\r\nhiss by which most snakes display their agitation, this little adder\r\nexpresses itself in long successive blowings, like its larger relative\r\n_arietans_, only a little less regularly. In the present instance, I\r\nsaw the lung inflated with an agitated undulating motion, as if the\r\nfluid air were entering in little waves. I do not state positively that\r\nthis is invariably the case from having witnessed it in one specimen.\r\nThis might be the normal process, or this viper’s lungs and health may\r\nhave been impaired. I am thus precise because it is unsafe to establish\r\nas an invariable fact in natural history what may have been seen only\r\noccasionally, a habit which has so often led to the promulgation of\r\nerroneous impressions.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged sound of the hiss in snakes is due to the size of the\r\nlung, they having a large supply of air to draw upon. Some serpents\r\nexpand their bodies under excitement without any perceptible hiss:\r\nthe cobra both hisses and expands, so do some others; but all these\r\nmovements are, no doubt, connected with respiration in some way, just\r\nas in human beings, sighing, sobbing, panting, etc., in which the\r\nribs take part, are only modifications of the ordinary movements of\r\nrespiration, and chiefly emotional.\r\n\r\nVery similar also to the manner of the puff adder is that of _Vipera\r\nrhinosceros_, one of the largest African poisonous serpents, known as\r\nthe ‘River Jack,’ being fond of water. One of these was in the London\r\ncollection for several years, and I observed that whenever disturbed,\r\nits body swelled considerably, while the ‘hissing,’ or expulsion of\r\nbreath, alternated with this expansion.\r\n\r\nSnakes, like other animals, probably differ in temper or in\r\nnervousness; for while some are noted hissers, others hiss only on\r\ngreat provocation, and others, again, not at all. One remarkable\r\nexample of a non-hissing snake, though from no amiability of temper,\r\nis the little carpet viper of India (_Echis carinata_). Unless you\r\nwere positively assured by learned authorities that this exceedingly\r\nirritable little viper never hisses, you would scarcely believe your\r\nears, so sibilant is the sound it causes by rustling its scales\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Fayrer, in the _Thanatophidia_, describes this as a very\r\nfierce and aggressive little viper, always ready to attack and be on\r\nthe defensive. It throws itself into a double coil, and its agitated\r\nmotion causes the rough, carinated scales to rub against each other,\r\nand make a sound like hissing, but ‘_it does not hiss_.’\r\n\r\nThis rustling is very much like the sound of the crotalus rattle, and\r\nthe dry scales must be raised in a sort of way, or ruffled, as an\r\nalarmed hen ruffles her feathers. ‘The outer scales are prominent,\r\nand at a different angle to the rest,’ says Fayrer. It generally lies\r\ncoiled in a compact form, often like a ‘w,’ as may be seen in the\r\nfrontispiece, with its head in the centre, but always towards the point\r\nof supposed danger, which in a cage is facing the spectator.\r\n\r\nCurious and wonderful is the agitation into which this carpet snake\r\nthrows itself when disturbed, every inch of it, excepting the head, in\r\nmotion. The head retains its fixed position, the eyes intently keeping\r\nguard, while the body moves in every conceivable curve, like wheels\r\nwithin wheels, yet retaining the same outline, or occupying the same\r\nplace and space, though every muscle must be in activity.\r\n\r\nOne can liken this behaviour only to what is seen in the blending\r\nof liquids of different densities. As you look down into a glass\r\ncontaining one fluid while drop after drop of another is falling, you\r\nperceive fresh currents and curves in every direction. Watching one\r\nof these, it has changed places with another, you lose trace of it,\r\neach drop is lost in the commingling of the whole. So it is with this\r\nwonderful little echis. It is almost impossible to follow with the eye\r\nany one portion or coil of its moving length; but each inch changes\r\nplaces and mingles with the rest, like blending fluids.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of an American snake (_Pituophis melanoleucus_), in which a\r\nsimilar excitement is observable, Mr. Samuel Lockwood[41] likens it\r\nto a ‘mystic wheel.’ ‘The movement consists of numberless units of\r\nindividual activities,’ he says, ‘and all regulated by and under the\r\nperfect control of one will that is felt in every curved line.’ There\r\nis some likeness to the ‘thousand personal activities of a regiment of\r\nsoldiers on their winding way.’ He has watched the creature ‘melting\r\ninto movements so intricate and delicate that the lithe and limbless\r\nthing looks like gossamer incarnate.’\r\n\r\nThis Pine snake is very smooth, and in the excited actions thus\r\ngraphically described, it makes no noise like the little Indian viper;\r\nbut Mr. Lockwood’s words are so appropriate to both snakes that\r\nthe reader has only to add in imagination the rustling noise that\r\naccompanies the quivering echis.\r\n\r\nAmong other of the ophidians remarkable for their hissing is _Psamophis\r\nsibilans_, the ‘hissing sand snake,’ a very slender little creature.\r\nSeveral mentioned by the earlier naturalists as ‘the hissing snake,’\r\nare evidently _Heterodons_. Catesby, Lawson, and others mention one as\r\nthe ‘blowing viper;’ _Blauser_ of the Dutch, also the ‘chequered’ or\r\n‘spreading-adder,’ which leaves no difficulty in identifying _Heterodon\r\nplatyrhinos_. An American writer indulges in a figure of speech while\r\ndescribing this little Coluber by saying, ‘It emits a succession\r\nof hisses, “sibilant sounds,” similar to letting off steam from a\r\nsmall steam engine.’ He at the same time admits that it is harmless\r\nand inoffensive in spite of its threatening aspect when flattening\r\nits head.’ This is the ‘spread head’ alluded to in chap. xxii., an\r\nunfortunate demonstration of alarm which has gained for it its venomous\r\ntitles. Several of this species have from time to time been added to\r\nthe collection at the Zoological Gardens, and the chief drawback to\r\ntheir anticipated attractions is that they so soon become tame and\r\npeaceful that you can scarcely provoke them to exhibit their reputed\r\npower. I have seen one flatten its head so slightly as to be barely\r\nnoticeable, but I never heard it ‘hiss.’\r\n\r\n‘Its spots become visibly brighter through rage,’ wrote Carver in 1796,\r\n‘and at the same time it blows from its mouth with great force a subtle\r\nwind that is reported to be of a nauseous smell.’ Chateaubriand, of\r\ncourse, had something to say of ‘the hissing snake,’ frequent in the\r\nwarmer States of America. ‘When approached it becomes flat, appears\r\nof different colours, and opens its mouth hissing. Great caution is\r\nnecessary not to enter the atmosphere which surrounds it. It decomposes\r\nthe air, which, imprudently inhaled, induces languor. The person wastes\r\naway, the lungs are affected, and in the course of four months he dies\r\nof consumption!’ Of another snake this author says, ‘He hisses like a\r\nmountain eagle, he bellows like a bull!’\r\n\r\nIt may be objected, ‘Why occupy space by quoting such old wives’\r\nfables?’ I reply, because they have already been so abundantly quoted;\r\nand to such fables are in great part due the erroneous impressions\r\nwhich exist to the present day. Several members of the _Heterodon_\r\nfamily have from time to time been in our London collection. Friends\r\nof mine have had _Heterodons_ in their keeping as pets; I have often\r\nhandled them, and found them gentle and inoffensive in every way. They\r\nare indeed so popularly and peculiarly interesting that they will claim\r\na page presently, the present chapter being devoted exclusively to\r\nophidian lungs, not human lungs, supposed to be destroyed by them!\r\n\r\nWhile admitting various degrees and qualities of hissing, we may give\r\na passing mention to Du Chaillu’s snakes, all of which appear to be of\r\nthe whistling, as well as of the ‘springing’ kind. He saw ‘an enormous\r\nblack shining snake, loathsome and horrid.’ ... ‘Then the fellow gave a\r\nspring, and whistled in a most horrid manner.’ And when he was wounded,\r\nhe again ‘gave a sharp whistle.’ On another occasion, while a Goree man\r\nwas playing with a large Naja, ‘the air around seemed to be filled with\r\nthe whistling sound of the creature,’ and so on.\r\n\r\nAnother African snake, the ‘Green Mamba,’ has such very bad manners\r\nthat it not only hisses, but spits and darts at you. In this instance\r\nmy informant was a young lady, who had ‘seen it!’\r\n\r\nSomewhat more perplexing, because more deserving of notice, is what\r\nLivingstone tells us of a serpent called _Nega-put-sane_, or ‘serpent\r\nof a kid,’ which ‘utters a cry by night exactly like the bleating of\r\nthat animal,’ and that he had ‘heard one at a spot where no kid could\r\npossibly have been.’[42]\r\n\r\n‘_Il canta como un gallo_,’ said Albert Seba of an astonishing snake in\r\nHayti and St. Domingo once.\r\n\r\n‘Beyond a hissing and often a peculiar drumming noise, snakes emit\r\nno sound,’ says Krefft, one of our very able authorities.[43] This\r\nexperienced writer does not positively affirm that the ‘drumming’\r\nis produced by the voice, and it is more likely to proceed from\r\nthe beating of an agitated tail, an action which may be frequently\r\nwitnessed in excited snakes.\r\n\r\nDr. Otto Wucherer saw this in a South American snake, _Xenodon\r\ncolubrinus_. ‘It has the habit of striking the ground rapidly with the\r\ntail when irritated’ (_Zoo. Soc. Proc._ 1861).\r\n\r\nSo do _Spilotes variabilis_, and some others. So also does the Pine\r\nsnake, whose tail ends in a horny tip, ‘like a four-sided spike,’ and\r\nwhich vibrates like a crotalus in rudiment, or strikes the ground.\r\n\r\nSeveral American naturalists have contributed interesting accounts\r\nof this last species, known as the ‘Bull’ or ‘Pine snake,’ or ‘Pilot\r\nsnake,’ the largest of the N. American Colubers. It was this species\r\n(_Pituophis melanoleucus_) whose actions Mr. Sam. Lockwood described as\r\nmystic circles, and its activity as almost equal to that of the ‘Racer’\r\n(_American Naturalist_, vol. ix. 1875). But it is called the Bull snake\r\nbecause it ‘roars like a bull.’ Bartram went so far as to say like\r\nthunder! ‘Said to hiss like thunder,’ or ‘resembling distant thunder,’\r\nis the cautious testimony of Holbrooke, who adds, ‘but I never heard\r\nit, though well acquainted with it.’\r\n\r\nMr. Lockwood minutely described one in his possession. In reading\r\nhis account we can but notice the similarity of action between this\r\n‘Bull snake’ and the African vipers in ‘puffing,’ though regarding\r\nthe nature of the sound, the writer positively affirms that ‘there is\r\nnothing sibilant in this blowing, not the slightest hiss about it.’\r\nMr. Lockwood records his experience of several that he had seen and\r\nheard, and of a fight between one and a rat. ‘Now began that fearful\r\nblowing. The snake slowly fills its lungs with air, and then expels it\r\nwith a bellowing sound that is really formidable.’ And again, in the\r\nsame volume, in reference to the former account, he says: ‘As there\r\nnoted, the _Pituophis_, when alarmed or enraged, slowly inflates itself\r\nwith air, thus nearly doubling its normal size along its entire length,\r\nexcept the tail. It then slowly expels the air with its own peculiar\r\nsound.’ He recalls his boyish terror on once hearing this sound, which\r\ncame upon him suddenly in a field, ‘like the restrained roaring of a\r\nbull.’ This was in New Jersey; but the _Pituophis_ family extends to\r\nthe Western States, and to the Rocky Mountains, where ‘Bull snakes’\r\nare frequently seen. In the reports of the United States Exploring\r\nExpeditions, mention has been made of the prairie Bull snake, and of\r\nothers in Nebraska and as far west as California.\r\n\r\nSome attain to seven feet in length; Holbrooke mentions one of nine\r\nfeet, and ‘as thick as your arm,’ in common parlance. An angry snake of\r\nthis size could, of course, blow with considerable force, and the term\r\n‘bellowing’ might not unreasonably be applied to the sound; as it is\r\nalso applied to the croaking of the ‘bull frog’ (_Rana mugiens_), the\r\nsound of which is really so like the lowing of cattle, that, on hearing\r\none for the first time in the woods of Virginia, I looked round, quite\r\nexpecting to see a young heifer in close proximity.[44] Probably, had\r\nthe bovine lungs sounded at the same moment, the reptilian ‘bellow’\r\nwould have proved but a feeble imitation. A sound out of place, so\r\nto speak, or unanticipated, strikes upon the ear more forcibly than\r\nwhen expected. But if one reptile, and that a very small one, can so\r\nwell imitate a bull as it is universally known the bull frog does,\r\nwhy may not another do the same?—an argument which I venture to use\r\nnotwithstanding many herpetologists accept doubtfully the possibility\r\nof a snake producing such a sound. ‘Il est difficile à concevoir\r\ncomment les serpents auraient la faculté de siffler, comme on pretend\r\nque peuvent le faire certaines espèces de couleuvres, et comme les\r\npoëtes se plaisent à nous les representer. Jamais nous n’avons pu\r\nentendre qu’un soufflement très sourd, provenant de l’air qui sortait\r\navec plus ou moins de rapidité de l’interieur de leur poumon que l’on\r\nvoyait s’affaisser en trouvant une issue par la glotte, à travers\r\nles trous des narines ou directement par la bouche dont la mâchoire\r\nsuperieure est naturellement echanchrée. Alors la bruit était seulement\r\ncomparable à celui qui resulterait du passage rapide et continue de\r\nl’air dans un tube ou par un tuyau sec et etroit, comme serait celui\r\nd’une plume.’[45]\r\n\r\nThis no doubt answers to the ordinary ‘hissing’ of the majority of\r\nsnakes; but that the sound varies under certain conditions, and in the\r\nsame serpent, cannot be denied. A. R. Wallace relates an incident which\r\nmay well be introduced here, as affording both a proof of the length\r\nof time snakes can sustain a sort of half suffocation, and also the\r\nexpression or power of ‘voice’ in breathing. A young boa was caught,\r\nand in order to prevent its escape, its captors, while preparing a box\r\nin which to convey it away, tied it tightly round the neck to a thick\r\nstick, which not only fettered its movements, but appeared to nearly\r\nstop its respiration. It lay writhing in much discomfort, sometimes\r\nopening its mouth with a suspicious yawn, as if trying hard to\r\nbreathe. By and by, when relieved from its clog and safely consigned\r\nto a box with bars on the top, it began to make up for loss of time by\r\nbreathing violently, ‘the expirations sounding like high-pressure steam\r\nescaping from a locomotive. This continued for some hours, of four and\r\na half respirations a minute,’ when the breathing—in this case we may\r\nsay panting—gradually subsided, and then the poor thing settled down\r\ninto silence.[46]\r\n\r\nThe expression of feelings by the tail in so many snakes, producing a\r\nsibilant sound in rustling dead leaves, and in some which are supposed\r\nnever to hiss, is a subject well worth the attention of scientific\r\nnaturalists. It would be interesting to ascertain if any peculiarity of\r\ntrachea or of glottis exist in these.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n_HIBERNATION._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE periodical torpor known as the winter sleep of reptiles is\r\nintimately connected with respiration, and a chapter must now be\r\ndevoted to this subject.\r\n\r\n‘Reptiles are obedient to the external atmosphere,’ has been aptly said\r\nof them. Thus, they obey the sun; for if exposed to his rays, they\r\nwarm into life and activity. They obey the frost; for when exposed to\r\nits influence, their functions grow feeble or fail altogether, and\r\nthey succumb to within a verge of lifelessness. They obey all the\r\nintermediate variations of temperature during the changing year, by\r\ndisplaying degrees of animation and activity responsive to the degree\r\nof warmth externally which they do not possess in themselves.\r\n\r\nBell speaks of hibernation as ‘amongst the most remarkable and\r\ninteresting phenomena which occur in the history of animals.’ It is\r\nnot a state of suffering, like that of a warm-blooded creature that is\r\nfrozen to death; but with one common impulse, reptiles all retire, and\r\nremain in an almost lifeless repose, with every function so nearly\r\nsuspended, that no external signs of existence are visible. For them it\r\nis a sort of rest, and we may cease to wonder at their longevity since\r\nthey live only half their lives. It is, indeed, a convenient mode of\r\ngetting through life, reminding us of a theory or proposal ventilated\r\nnot long since, by which convicts were to be economically provided\r\nfor by submitting them to a certain freezing process, and disposing\r\nthem neatly on rows of shelves until the expiration of their term of\r\npunishment; all to be done then was to dust them thoroughly—perhaps\r\nscrub them a little—and restore them to the world and life again. And\r\nthey were promised to be none the worse, not even to have lost their\r\nmemory or to have acquired the rheumatism. Unfortunately the wonderful\r\nprocess has never been made clear to anxious inquirers, or some others\r\nof us, who are _not_ convicts, might gladly resort to this method of\r\nrest occasionally, and of freezing out the worries of existence.\r\n\r\nOn the principle of political economy, this would be all very well, and\r\nin the great routine of nature there is beneficence in the hibernation\r\nof creatures, whether reptiles or other animals, that are sent to\r\nsleep at the very time when food fails them. The smaller members of\r\nthe class have no longer insects and molluscs; the larger ones feed\r\nchiefly on rodents and birds which have also retired or migrated, or on\r\ntheir lesser kinsfolk, that no longer abound where most wanted by them.\r\nTherefore, this going to sleep every winter, and doing without food\r\nwhen there is no food to be had, is most convenient for a considerable\r\nsection of animated nature.\r\n\r\nThere is something strangely analogous in the almost total suspension\r\nof vital forces in reptiles to that which vegetation undergoes.\r\nCirculation stops, the juices become stagnant, whether in a tree or\r\nin a snake, and it is sometimes difficult to decide in either case\r\nwhether life is extinct or not. But with returning warmth comes renewed\r\nvitality; the fluids, whether of the animal or the vegetable organism,\r\nare thawed by the revivifying solar rays, which set them circulating\r\nand start the pulsation; and the animal machinery, like a watch wound\r\nup, is set in working order again.\r\n\r\nIt is owing to this lack of warmth in themselves that snakes can live\r\nonly in hot countries, or in cooler latitudes, during the warmer\r\nweather, and not at all in the frigid zones. In speaking of them,\r\nDumeril says Linnæus was right in calling them cold animals in hot\r\ncountries. ‘Aussi la plupart des Ophidiens habitent-ils les climats\r\nchauds, et c’est en parlant d’eux que Linné a pu dire avec raison:\r\n“Frigida æstuantium animalia.”’[47]\r\n\r\nDumeril describes their respiration as arbitrary, suspended, retarded,\r\nor accelerated at will. ‘La respiration étant volontairement accélerée\r\nou retardée, les actions chimiques et vitales qui en resultent doivent\r\nêtre naturellement excitées ou ralenties par cette cause.’[48] ‘The\r\nelectric fluid,’ says Latreille, ‘is one of the great agents in\r\nanimating living beings; and upon reptiles it operates in conjunction\r\nwith warmth in rousing them from their inactivity.’\r\n\r\nThe periodical torpor and insensibility which reptiles undergo cannot,\r\nhowever, be always associated with extremes of cold, nor in all cases\r\ncalled strictly a ‘_winter_’ sleep; because it is during the hottest\r\nseasons in the tropics that they resign themselves similarly to an\r\nalmost death-like repose and temporary tomb, burying themselves in the\r\nmud, which is hard-baked around and over them, almost hermetically\r\nsealed until the rainy season loosens the soil, and frees them from\r\nthis literal sarcophagus. In this case the so-called ‘hibernation’ is\r\nthe result of drought. It is moisture now which revivifies them, rain\r\nwhich restores their vital functions, and like the chrysalis bursting\r\nits shell and emerging a new and brilliant creature, the reptile lives\r\nanew, doffs his muddy coat, and reappears in all his resplendent\r\ncolouring.\r\n\r\nThe prairie rattlesnake (_Crotalus confluentus_) is known to undergo\r\nthis species of torpor, which is, in fact, estivation. It is described\r\nas having been found in this ‘stupid condition’ in the dry cañons of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains during the droughts of July and August. American\r\nnaturalists who accompany the Exploring Expeditions affirm that this\r\npartial torpor is common to many species of snakes, and analogous to\r\nhibernation. They are ‘sluggish, stupid, blind, striking wildly,’ says\r\none of the official Reports.\r\n\r\nSnakes remain torpid on an average half the year. It is a winter sleep\r\nin colder and temperate climates, and a summer sleep in hot ones.\r\nThe green garter-snake of the United States hibernates eight months\r\nout of the twelve. So do some of the Australian snakes, others being\r\nunderground five months in the year, Krefft tells us. The duration of\r\ninsensibility varies, of course, with the climate and season.\r\n\r\nSnakes in menageries have been known to manifest inactivity and\r\ndisinclination for food as early as September if the season be\r\nunusually cold, at other times in October; but, on the contrary,\r\nduring a milder season they keep active until November, while some do\r\nnot hibernate at all. Their habits there can, however, scarcely be\r\ncited as normal, since the artificial heat regularly maintained in the\r\nOphidarium never permits the rigours of an out-door winter to affect\r\nthem. Nevertheless they manifest the disposition for repose; and if\r\nit could be so arranged that the tropical snakes could be submitted\r\nto tropical heat and drought, and those of cooler countries to frosty\r\nair, as in a state of nature, we might witness both estivation and\r\nhibernation under the same roof.\r\n\r\nA partial hibernation is observable in reptiles in captivity when,\r\nthough not absolutely inactive, they decline food. For twenty-two\r\nweeks a python at the Zoological Gardens fasted during one winter; at\r\nanother time, twenty weeks. The large python (_reticulatus_) fasted\r\nfor one year and eleven months, covering two winters, but fed well\r\nand retained its health after this. Meanwhile, during this prolonged\r\nfast, should a gleam of sunshine penetrate the foggy atmosphere of our\r\nLondon winters, and shine through the glass roof upon a constrictor’s\r\ncoverlet, he may slowly emerge therefrom, displaying a few feet of his\r\nlazy length for an hour or so, thus verifying the words, ‘obedient\r\nto the external atmosphere.’ No creatures are so susceptible of the\r\nchanges of temperature; and the same degree which caused them to seek a\r\nretreat will, on the return of spring, reanimate them. And warmth—in\r\nthem almost another word for vitality—equally affects their appetite.\r\nIn the very height of summer, should their feeding-day prove a chilly\r\none, a much lighter drain on the larder is observable, while a warm,\r\nbright day will show a heavy poulterer’s bill _in re Ophidarium_. Dr.\r\nA. Stradling, a practical ophiologist, found that the common English\r\nsnakes ‘thrive exceedingly by reason of their increased appetites,’\r\nwhen taken to the tropics. ‘It is impossible to say what degree of heat\r\na reptile will not stand and enjoy,’ says this writer (_Field_, July\r\n28, 1881). ‘On the hottest days in the hottest places on earth, one\r\nsurprises snakes and lizards basking in the blazing sun-glare, on sands\r\nand rocks which it would almost blister the hand to touch.’ Florida is\r\nthe most southern extreme of my own experience; but during a summer\r\nthere one could not rest the hand on the almost burning stones and\r\nwalls on which the reptiles delightedly reposed; and even in England,\r\nduring a hot August, my little Bournemouth lizards were positively\r\nhot to the touch when basking in the full power of a bright noon sun.\r\nDumeril corroborates these facts when he says some reptiles can endure\r\na temperature higher than blood-heat. Sometimes in early spring he\r\nfound a snake seeming to be asleep under a very hot wall which had been\r\nexposed to the mid-day sun, but which had been several hours in shadow.\r\nSo tenaciously had the reptile retained the heat it had then absorbed,\r\nthat though the air now felt cold, the snake imparted _une chaleur très\r\nnotable_ when he touched it. Many times, in taking up a lizard from a\r\nsunny rock in summer, it really has _brulé les doigts_.[49] The old\r\nfable about salamanders living in fire no doubt originates in the fact\r\nof reptiles loving heat as they do. Many pages might be filled with\r\ninstances of this, and of their approaching fire to a suicidal extent.\r\n\r\nEqually strange is the degree of cold to which they can sometimes\r\nsubmit, and yet recover. But we must conclude that this is when they\r\nare overcome _gradually_, not suddenly, by it, and not exposed to the\r\nouter air so that the tissues would be injured. Dr. Carpenter mentions\r\nreptiles having been kept three years in an ice-house, and recovering\r\non being gradually restored to warmth. Too recklessly acting upon this,\r\nI deposited my pet lizards in a small, shallow box containing moss,\r\nsand, and soft rubbish, and left them outside a window to hibernate.\r\nThey buried themselves as deeply as they could go,—only a few inches,\r\nalas!—but a sudden and severe frost set in, and the poor little\r\nvictims were frozen stiff at the bottom of their prison-house. It was\r\nin a bleak north-eastern aspect, and the sharp frost easily striking\r\nthrough the wood, that slight box must have proved a very different\r\nsort of nest to what they would have chosen on their native heath,—far\r\ndown, and well protected from the icy winds. In a strong, deep box, or\r\nan earthenware jar, with sufficient earth and rubbish in it, they might\r\nhave survived.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum of Paris in 1875-76, sixteen rattlesnakes are said to\r\nhave died of cold. The heating apparatus at the Jardin des Plantes is\r\nless effective than our own in London, where very few of the snakes\r\nhave been known to suffer from lowered temperature.\r\n\r\nSnakes are abundantly supplied with oily fat; thick layers of it line\r\ntheir intestines in autumn, and this is gradually absorbed during\r\ntheir torpor. They therefore lose weight, and awake in an enfeebled\r\ncondition, only gradually recovering their normal strength after some\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe power of endurance in serpents, and their independence of a large\r\nsupply of oxygen, render them important agents in the economy of\r\nnature. In the swamps and morasses where malaria abounds, reptiles\r\nare most numerous. Many such places under canopies of pestilential\r\nvapours, swarm with insects, molluscs, worms, caterpillars, and the\r\nsmaller reptiles on which snakes mostly feed. They are, therefore, the\r\nscavengers of such localities; they fulfil a great law by keeping up\r\nthe balance of nature even to the extent of rendering certain countries\r\nhabitable.\r\n\r\nThose ophidian families which prefer higher lands, sandy or rocky\r\ndistricts, select the sunny hill-sides when the frost sets in, and\r\nhide themselves under stones or in caves where, as described in the\r\nchapter on rattlesnakes, they congregate in vast numbers. Piles and\r\nconvolutions of serpents in this condition have often been discovered,\r\nand as often described. It is as if the small degree of animal\r\nwarmth each one possessed were harvested for their mutual good, and\r\nto the benefit of the whole community. Nor are these assemblages\r\nat all exclusive as to kind, but are dens of discordant materials,\r\nwhere, as an American wrote, ‘the liberal terms of admission seemed\r\nonly to require the evidence of snakeship.’ Lizards, too, though\r\nof widely-branching kinship, are guided by the same instinct, and\r\nsometimes share the retreat.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, near Hayward’s Heath in Sussex, some men who were\r\nlevelling the ground for building, dug out of a bank at a depth of from\r\nfour to five feet, upwards of one hundred slow worms and as many small\r\nlizards, all in a torpid state. It was during February.\r\n\r\nAt the end of September more recently, a farmer in Wales, who with his\r\nlabourers was removing a heap of manure, came upon an extraordinary\r\nbed of snakes and slow worms, and no less than 352 were killed,\r\ntogether with an enormous quantity of eggs; ‘thousands in clusters were\r\ndestroyed.’ Three of the snakes were of immense size, and one hundred\r\nof them nine to twelve inches long.’ These latter were probably slow\r\nworms, and the three ‘immense’ ones ring snakes. One feels curious\r\nto know whether judgment for this act of wanton cruelty visited that\r\nfarmer in a destruction of his crops next year by the mice and insects\r\nfrom which these harmless reptiles would have saved them!\r\n\r\nThe general reptilian instincts are the same in all climates where\r\nthe temperature is similar. In Australia, as Krefft tells us, this is\r\na grand time among schoolboys for ‘snake-hunting.’ They lay traps of\r\nlarge flat stones on open sunny ridges where the reptiles are likely\r\nto resort. Six to ten specimens of different species are often taken\r\nunder one such stone. Even the venomous kinds may be easily captured\r\nand transferred to a bag in their half-dormant condition. Sometimes\r\nin lifting a stone, a dozen or more handsome and beautiful lizards\r\nare found among their ophidian cousins. The Wallaby hunters generally\r\nprovide themselves with a collecting-bag, and thousands of snakes have\r\nthus been transferred to museums. So expert do the hunters become,\r\nthat in eight years, the same author affirms, not one accident has\r\noccurred from a venomous species. From May to September in Australia,\r\ntimid persons need be in no fear of snakes in the ‘scrub.’ The larger\r\nand more dangerous species retire deep into the ground, and only the\r\nyoung ones under stones. Warm days entice them out for an hour or two,\r\nand they retire again at night, just as is the case with those of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were aware of this hibernation of reptiles; and Pliny,\r\nwho, having sometimes a foundation of fact to build upon, is all the\r\nmore dangerous from his fabulous superstructure, writes, ‘The viper\r\nis the only serpent that conceals itself in the earth. It can live\r\nthere without taking food for a whole year. _They are not venomous\r\nwhen they are asleep_,’ he sagely adds. Vipers can live without food\r\nfor even more than a year, and so can other snakes; but this often is\r\nirrespective of hibernation, and of this more will be said presently.\r\n\r\nA still stronger evidence of vitality or suspended animation is\r\nwitnessed in the extraordinary custom of packing the poor wretched\r\nsnakes in air-tight bottles, which some barbarous (the word here in\r\nboth senses may be used) people adopt. A Cerastes arrived in England\r\nin a bottle, which had been hermetically closed for six weeks, and\r\nit revived. It was so crowded into the bottle as to look quite dead,\r\nbut revived directly it was released, and struck a fowl, which died\r\ninstantly! Sometimes a bottle or jar is literally crowded with ophidian\r\ncaptives, that are certainly out of harm’s way so far as others are\r\nconcerned, and travel in a compact compass; but it stands to reason\r\nthat even when they survive this close imprisonment, they are not in a\r\nvery lively condition, and the large mortality which is found in most\r\ncollections may be imputed to a great extent to the unhealthy condition\r\nin which they arrive after injudicious packing. Nailed up in air-tight\r\nboxes, is a very ordinary mode of transportation, a species of cruelty\r\nwhich would raise a cry of horror were the captive any other than a\r\ndespised ‘reptile!’ In connection with breathing or not breathing, and\r\npowers of endurance, _such packing_ receives only a passing mention\r\nhere, but is one that should be thoroughly exposed in the _Animal\r\nWorld_ and similar papers.\r\n\r\nOne more singular example of periodical repose, but which can scarcely\r\nbe called either hibernation or estivation, is seen in the sea snakes,\r\nthe _Hydrophidæ_ of the Eastern Ocean. Of these Dr. Cantor affirms\r\nthat they are seen so soundly asleep on the surface of the water,\r\nthat a ship passing among them does not awaken them. This is the more\r\nremarkable because the eyes of sea snakes are organized to endure\r\nthe glare of light only when modified or subdued through water, and\r\nare easily affected when out of it, the reptiles becoming dazzled,\r\nand even blinded, by bright sunshine. So that we must suppose some\r\npeculiar insensibility of nerve in these, or a cessation of active\r\nfunctions during their repose analogous to the hibernation of land\r\nsnakes. Another interesting inquiry suggests itself: viz. How does\r\none ascertain that an open-eyed snake is ‘_asleep_’? We called that\r\nRacer (p. 64) ‘asleep,’ as it appeared to be quite unconscious of\r\ninterruption, and did not move at our approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n_THE TAIL OF A SNAKE._\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTING aside for the present the true death-dealing powers of\r\nthe ophidians, viz. the fangs of the poisonous families and the\r\nconstricting powers of the larger non-venomous kinds, another\r\n_supposed_ medium of mischief, second only to the tongue, is the tail!\r\n\r\nThe old-time fables of the ‘stinging tails’ have always obtained\r\ncredence, and do so still among the ignorant classes in many countries.\r\nNor is the belief without some apparent reason, for the tail of a large\r\nnumber of snakes, both of the poisonous and the non-poisonous families,\r\nterminates in a horny spine more or less hard and pointed. In a few,\r\nthis sharp spine is curved with an undeniably weapon-like aspect. Some\r\nof these thorn-like tips might even be capable of inflicting a slight\r\nwound were the owners conscious of this, and had they a disposition to\r\navail themselves of it. But, as a weapon, snakes do _not_ instinctively\r\nuse their pointed tails; they are chiefly assistants in locomotion. As\r\na fulcrum, and sometimes a propeller, certain species make constant\r\nand important use of them. You may observe that when in a position\r\nof danger, many snakes trust greatly to the pressure of their tails,\r\nwhether pointed or not, as a balance or even a support. This pressure,\r\nwhich is forcible, but not aggressive, no doubt gave rise in the first\r\ninstance to the belief that the snake was intentionally endeavouring to\r\ninflict a wound—a myth which, like all the other ophidian myths, is so\r\nhard to eradicate.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Browne, in his _Pseudoxia_, more than two hundred years\r\nago, mentioned this as one of the ‘Vulgar Errours.’ As very little\r\nwas known of foreign snakes at that time, 1672, excepting through\r\nclassic writers, one must suppose that our poor little native _Anguis\r\nfragilis_ was included among the weapon-tailed snakes, ‘that worm with\r\nvenomed tongue’ which does really in a remarkable manner make important\r\nthough innocent use of its very blunt tail as a means of progression.\r\nHe says, ‘That Snakes and Vipers do sting, or transmit their Mischief\r\nby the Tail, is a common Expression, not easy to be justified.... The\r\nPoison lying about their Teeth and communicated by Bite in such as are\r\ndestructive. And Bitings mentioned in Scripture are differentially set\r\ndown from such as Mischief by Stings.’[50] ‘God commanded Moses to\r\ntake up the Serpent by the Tail,’ Sir Thomas Browne reminds us, as if\r\nin proof that the caudal extremity was perfectly harmless. ‘Nor are\r\nall Snakes of such empoisoning Qualities as common Opinion presumeth,’\r\nthe author endeavours to impress upon his readers, because there are\r\nseveral histories of domestic snakes from ‘Ophiophagous Nations and\r\nsuch as feed on Serpents.’ Then follows an opinion equally wise and\r\nwitty. ‘Surely the destructive Delusion of Satan in this Shape hath\r\nmuch enlarged the Opinion of their Mischief. Which was not so high with\r\nthe Heathens, in whom the Devil had wrought a better Opinion of this\r\nAnimal, it being sacred unto the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, and the\r\ncommon symbol of Sanity.’\r\n\r\nBut, alas! many spiny-tailed snakes have sprung to light in various\r\ncountries, long since Sir Thomas Browne so wisely instructed his\r\nreaders; and even now, the ‘death adder of Australia (_Acanthophis\r\nantarctica_) is much dreaded on account of its thorn-like tail.’\r\nKrefft’s[51] description of the repulsive aspect of this snake is\r\nsufficiently terrifying, apart altogether from its looks alone, its\r\nragged-looking head, with its loose scales, thick body, and its\r\nshort, rough, unmistakeable tail, terminating in a suspicious-looking\r\npoint, as if one sharp spine had taken root there, and was capable of\r\ninflicting a wound. The tail spine hardens only in age, he tells us,\r\nand ‘is really not a weapon either of attack or defence.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Death Adder (from Krefft’s _Snakes of Australia_).]\r\n\r\nAnother tail of evil repute belongs to the Water Viper of the United\r\nStates, vernacularly known as the ‘Thorn-tail’ snake, _Trigonocephalus\r\npiscivorus_ of American herpetologists.\r\n\r\nJohn Lawson, in his _History of Carolina_, published in 1707, was one\r\nof the first to describe it. After him we hear of it from Catesby. The\r\nquaint descriptions of each of these early travellers are amusing; and\r\nfrom such accounts the progress of science is traced.\r\n\r\n‘Of the Horn Snake,’ says Lawson, ‘I never saw but two that I remember.\r\nThey are like the Rattlesnake in Colour, but rather lighter. They hiss\r\nexactly like a Goose when anything approaches them. They strike at\r\ntheir Enemy with their Tail, and kill whatsoever they wound with it,\r\nwhich is armed at the End with a Horny Substance like a Cock’s Spur.\r\nThis is their Weapon. I have heard it credibly reported by those who\r\nsaid they were Eye-Witnesses, that a small Locust Tree, about the\r\nThickness of a Man’s Arm, being struck by one of these Snakes at Ten\r\no’clock in the Morning, then verdant and flourishing, at Four in the\r\nAfternoon was dead, and the Leaves dead and withered.’ (Probably the\r\ntree had been struck by lightning during the interval, a very frequent\r\noccurrence in those parts.) ‘Doubtless, be it how it will, they are\r\nvery venomous. I think the Indians do not pretend to cure their wound.’\r\n\r\nWhen Lawson travelled, setting out in December 1700, as an appointed\r\n‘Surveyor-General’ of the newly settled colony of North Carolina, very\r\nlittle was known of the natural history and productions of those parts,\r\nand he relied on the native tribes for much of his information.\r\n\r\nHis work was dedicated ‘To His Excellency, William Lord Craven,\r\nPalatine; The Most Noble Henry, Duke of Beaufort; The Right Hon. John\r\nLord Carteret; and the rest of the True and Absolute Lords, Proprietors\r\nof the Province of Carolina in America.’\r\n\r\n‘As a Debt of Gratitude the Sheets were laid at their Lordships’ Feet,\r\nhaving nothing to recommend them but Truth, a Gift which every Author\r\nmay be Master of if he will.’\r\n\r\nWith ever so praiseworthy an _intention_ of telling ‘the Truth,’ Lawson\r\ndid not possess the scientific knowledge to enable him to guard against\r\nerror. Neither did Colonel Beverley, who wrote a _History of Virginia_,\r\npublished in London in 1722, and who perpetuated the ‘stinging tail.’\r\n‘There is likewise a Horn Snake, so called from a Sharp Horn it carries\r\nin its Tail, with which it assaults anything that offends it, with that\r\nForce that, as it is said, it will strike its Tail into the Butt End of\r\na Musket, from whence it is not able to disengage itself.’\r\n\r\nA few years later, Catesby went over the same ground as a professed\r\nnaturalist, and afforded a more rational account of this ‘horn snake,’\r\nto which he assigned the name of _Vipera aquatica_, ‘Water viper,’ or\r\n‘Water rattlesnake.’ ‘Not that it hath a Rattle. The Tail of this Viper\r\nis small towards the End, and terminates in a blunt, horny Point, about\r\nhalf an Inch long. This harmless little Thing has given a dreadful\r\nCharacter to its Owner, imposing a Belief on the Credulous that he is\r\nthe terrible Horn Snake armed with Death at both Ends, thus attributing\r\nto him another Instrument of Death besides that he had before, though\r\nin reality of equal Truth with that of the Two-headed Amphisbæna. Yet\r\nwe are told that this fatal Horn, by a Jerk of the Tail, not only\r\nmortally wounds Men and other Animals but if by Chance struck into a\r\nyoung Tree, whose Bark is more easily penetrated than an old one, the\r\nTree instantly withers, and turns black and dies.’[52]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in mentioning the ‘Horn snake,’ many subsequent writers,\r\nseizing on the marvellous rather than the rational, have omitted the\r\nqualifying ‘it is said to inflict a wound,’ and Catesby’s exposition of\r\nthe absurdity; thus handing down as a fact that the tail was truly a\r\nterrible weapon!\r\n\r\nIt was probably this water viper which Chateaubriand had in his mind\r\nwhen, towards the end of that century, he described the ‘Prickly snake,\r\nshort and thick. It has a sting in its tail, the wound of which is\r\nmortal!’ Chateaubriand was much quoted for a long period.\r\n\r\nDr. J. E. Holbrooke, in his _North American Herpetology_, published\r\nat New York in 1842, corroborates all Catesby further said regarding\r\nthe fish-loving tastes of the ‘Thorn-tail’ snake, and which obtained\r\nfor it the specific name _piscivorus_. It frequents damp and swampy\r\nplaces, and is never seen far from water. In the summer (during\r\nCatesby’s time), great numbers might be seen lying on the low boughs\r\nof trees overhanging a river, whence they would drop into the water\r\nand pursue the fish with great swiftness. Few fish exceed its velocity\r\nin swimming. _Cenchris_ or _Trigonocephalus piscivorus_ is the name by\r\nwhich American herpetologists now recognise it. It is becoming rare\r\nwhere formerly it abounded, but is still found in the wilder districts\r\nof the less settled States, and in the hot weather may be seen lying\r\nmotionless on the low branches, and often so like a portion of the\r\nbough as not to be observed till the sudden plunge tells that a deadly\r\nsnake was close at hand. It is a cannibal besides, and other snakes\r\nare afraid of it and give it a wide berth. The horny spine (which is\r\na mere hardening and consolidation of the terminal scales) and another\r\nfeature, namely the ‘pit’ in its cheeks, described in chap. xxi., prove\r\nit to be allied to the rattlesnake. It is therefore included among the\r\n_Crotalidæ_, of which more hereafter.[53]\r\n\r\nA number of the ‘Pit vipers’ and _Trigonocephali_ are furnished with\r\nhard-pointed tails, and when they vibrate them rapidly, as many snakes\r\ndo under excitement, the rustling against the dead leaves produces a\r\nsound very similar to the sibilation of the true _Crotalus_ tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tail of _Lachesis mutus_ (exact size).]\r\n\r\n_Trigonocephalus contortrix_, the ‘Copper-head,’ is another of these.\r\nAlso the renowned ‘Bushmaster’ of Guiana and Brazil (_Lachesis mutus_,\r\nor _Crotalus mutus_), of which latter Darwin wrote, confirming Cuvier’s\r\nreasons for making it a sub-genus of the rattlesnake:—‘I observed a\r\nfact which appears to me very curious, as showing how every character,\r\neven though it may be independent of structure, has a tendency to vary\r\nby slow degrees. The extremity of the tail of this snake is terminated\r\nby a horny point, which is slightly enlarged, and as the animal glides\r\nalong, it constantly vibrates the last inch or so; and this part,\r\nstriking against the dry grass and brushwood, produces a rattling\r\nnoise which can be distinctly heard at the distance of six feet. As\r\noften as the animal was irritated or surprised, its tail was shaken,\r\nand its vibrations were extremely rapid. This _Trigonocephalus_ has,\r\ntherefore, in some respects the structure of a viper with the habits of\r\na rattlesnake.’\r\n\r\nDr. Günther and Sir Joseph Fayrer both mention a peculiarity of this\r\nkind in some of the Eastern representatives of the _Crotalus_, viz.\r\nthe _Trimeresuri_, Indian tree snakes. The former writes: ‘Some have\r\nprehensile tails, which, when not so occupied, vibrate rapidly,\r\nproducing a rustling sound among the leaves.’[54] Others of the family\r\nhave horny tails.\r\n\r\nDr. Andrew Smith, in his _Zoology of South Africa_, mentions _Vipera\r\ncaudalis_ especially, as having a ‘tail distinctly recognised, at the\r\ntermination of his very thick body, and which is not often seen.’ In\r\nthe vipers, however, more than others, tails are distinguishable,\r\nthose of many of them being short as well as suddenly tapering to a\r\npoint. The deadly Puff adder is called _Brachyura_ on this account, its\r\ntail being extremely short for the size of the snake. One exceedingly\r\ndangerous kind in St. Lucia is known as the ‘Rat-tailed snake.’ For\r\nclimbing, and as a propelling power, this slender tail can be of little\r\nservice. In St. Lucia is also a ‘Rat snake,’ _Crebo_ or _Cribo_ in\r\nvernacular (_Spilotes variabilis_), one of the active non-venomous\r\nkinds which, not content with rats and mice for food, wages war on its\r\nmost venomous fellow-reptiles; as the ‘Racer’ and the ‘King snake’\r\ndo against the rattlesnake of the United States. This _Crebo_ is a\r\ngraceful, elegant creature, and on account of its twofold virtues of\r\nmouser and ‘rat-tail’ catcher, is domesticated and petted in some of\r\nthe islands.[55]\r\n\r\nIn many of the Colubrine snakes it is almost impossible to distinguish\r\nwhere the ribs cease and the tail begins, except by the anus, so very\r\ngradually does the body taper. Nor does there appear to be any certain\r\nrule about the _length_ of tails, which in some snakes are even longer\r\nthan their bodies, and in others not one-tenth the length.\r\n\r\nIn giving the length of a few snakes (not in feet or inches, but in\r\nthe number of their vertebræ), the reader will obtain a clear idea of\r\nthis variation in tails. One species of rattlesnake has 194 vertebræ,\r\nof which 168 support each a pair of ribs, leaving 24 for its tail,\r\nor one-eighth. The python has 291 vertebræ, of which the 3d to the\r\n251st support a pair of ribs, leaving 40 for its tail, or less than\r\none-seventh of its length.\r\n\r\nLet me explain a seeming discrepancy of arithmetic. The spine of the\r\nboa constrictor consists of 304 vertebræ, of which 2 next the head\r\nsupport no ribs, and 252 support each a pair of ribs. Taking away the\r\nfirst two, which, having _no ribs_, may be said to form the neck of the\r\nsnake, that leaves fifty joints for the tail, or about one-sixth of the\r\nentire length. Our little sums, therefore, are as follows, in reckoning\r\nthe vertebræ:—\r\n\r\n    RATTLESNAKE.           BOA CONSTRICTOR.         PYTHON.\r\n\r\n  Neck,               2   Neck,               2   Neck,         2\r\n  Supporting ribs,  168   Supporting ribs,  252   With ribs,  249\r\n  Tail,              24   Tail,              50   Tail,        40\r\n                   ——                    ——              ——\r\n           Total,   194            Total,   304       Total,  291\r\n\r\nThough in form the ‘neck’ of a snake is often as undistinguishable as\r\nthe tail—‘une tête sans col, et une queue, dont l’origine se confond\r\navec le reste du corps,’ as Dumeril expresses it—there is the one\r\ninvariable rule belonging to it, namely, that the first two joints of\r\na snake’s spine are ribless, and that the ribs begin at the third.\r\nPhysiologists tell us a snake has no neck, and for reasons which will\r\nbe explained in the next chapter; yet, by way of distinction, all speak\r\nof ‘the neck’ as an accepted fact.\r\n\r\nNo invariable rule as to tails can, however, be established, either as\r\nregards length, shape, or character. Firstly, the length of the tail\r\nvaries from inches to feet in snakes of nearly the same size. Secondly,\r\nboth venomous and harmless ones are occasionally furnished with horny\r\ntips, and both vibrate them with equal rapidity. Thirdly, snakes that\r\nhave long _spineless_ tails also vibrate them rapidly; as do snakes\r\nwith short spineless tails; so that one cannot say that spines are\r\nconfined to one genus, any more than is their use or their action.\r\nThe vibration of the tail is, in fact, only ‘an outlet for suppressed\r\nenergy,’ as Professor Shaler of the United States has lucidly put it.\r\nExcitement displays itself in the tail of a snake as much as in the\r\ntail of a dog. This may be observed at the Ophidarium, or wherever\r\nan active snake can be watched. In the rattlesnake it is, of course,\r\nmore conspicuous, and always audible when agitated; but many others\r\nsimilarly display their feelings in their eloquent caudal terminations.\r\n\r\nA handsome young python, of about eight feet long, at the Zoological\r\nGardens, has a tail of which the last few inches taper so suddenly that\r\nthe extreme end of this reptile appears almost ludicrously trivial for\r\nso fine a possessor. One inch of this—hardly thicker than a rat’s\r\ntail—you may see wriggling so rapidly that you can scarcely follow its\r\nmovements, or believe that it is a part of the large quiescent body to\r\nwhich it is attached. In pursuit of its prey the python itself glides\r\nwith slow dignity, while the trifling little terminal inch or so of\r\ntail is in a perpetual but most _un_dignified wriggle.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Racer,’ already familiar to the reader, the tail is one-fourth\r\nthe length of the body; in the ‘milk snake’ (_Coluber eximius_),\r\nintroduced in chapter iv., it is one-fifth. The extensive variation in\r\ntails may be comprehended by their number of vertebræ, which in some\r\nsnakes amount to 200, and in others are reduced to 5.\r\n\r\nOf the practical uses of the snake’s tail, the _natural_ uses,—those\r\nabove mentioned being either imaginary ones, or a mere expression\r\nof feeling,—the prehensile power is one of the greatest. ‘Strictly\r\nspeaking, the true prehensile tail is found only in the boa,’ Schlegel,\r\nOwen, and other physiologists tell us; but that statement refers to\r\nsome peculiar anatomical construction, enabling the tail to twine and\r\ngrasp with extraordinary force, because nearly all snakes can manage to\r\nclimb, or to raise themselves when occasion requires it, making use of\r\ntheir tails, as was stated at the commencement of this chapter. ‘Even\r\nthe clumsy, ugly death adder can climb well,’ Krefft assures us, and\r\nthat it can support itself against a wall with only a portion of its\r\ntail on the ground.\r\n\r\nMany writers and observers, in describing this power or force in\r\nthe snake, have given rise to the idea that snakes can _stand_ on\r\ntheir tails. Erect themselves nearly upright they certainly do, even\r\nwithout extraneous support for a few moments, and _with_ support for a\r\nconsiderable time.\r\n\r\nCobras can do this. A personal friend, Colonel C——, when in India,\r\nonce heard a sort of muffled sound at his door, which caused him to\r\nopen it suddenly, when a cobra, which had raised itself three or more\r\nfeet against it, fell straight into the room. He sprang quickly aside,\r\nand ran to fetch a stick, but when he got back the cobra was gone.\r\n\r\nBut to return to their prehensile powers. Snakes which are not habitual\r\nclimbers are often found in trees, suspending themselves from or\r\nsupporting themselves upon the branches, as instanced in the chapter\r\non the egg-eaters. The _Hamadryad_ is also much in trees, as its name\r\nimplies, and is seen hanging from the branches. This latter, and also\r\nthe Indian tree snakes, _Trimeresuri_, are poisonous, and far removed\r\nfrom the boas with the true prehensile tail. Familiar to every one are\r\nillustrations of tropical scenery, in which the boa constrictor and\r\nthe anaconda, hanging from trees, are important features. Dumeril, in\r\ngeneral terms, says: ‘Les ophidiens rampent, glissent, s’accrochent,\r\nse suspendent, gravissent en s’aidant de la totalité de leur corps,\r\nsautent, s’élancent, bondissent, nagent, et plongent,’[56] in every\r\none of which movements the tail is an important agent. _S’accrocher_\r\nand _se suspendre_ must be mainly by the agency of the tail. Schlegel\r\nfollows up his statement, ‘tail strictly prehensile found only in\r\nboas,’ by explaining, nevertheless, that a short tail is sufficiently\r\nvigorous to _attach_ itself to any point, and support the whole\r\nbody.[57] In the non-venomous tree snakes the tail is long and slender,\r\nand no squirrel or bird is more active and at home in a tree than\r\nthese. They glide, swing, climb, and almost fly from branch to branch,\r\nscarcely disturbing a leaf.\r\n\r\nOur ‘excellent egg merchant,’ introduced as the Racer, though a\r\nground snake, is equally at home in a tree, and holds on by its tail\r\nwith remarkable adroitness, but then the Racer or ‘Pilot snake’ is a\r\ntrue boa also. (The true ‘boa’ is distinguished by its dentition and\r\nformation of jaw-bones, the term ‘boa,’ so variously and perplexingly\r\nused by some of the older naturalists, being now restricted to certain\r\nnon-venomous species which possess such anatomical structure.)\r\n\r\nLawson’s description of this ‘Racer’ is graphic. ‘The long black Snake\r\nfrequents the Land altogether, and is the nimblest Creature living. His\r\nBite has no more Venom than a Prick with a Pin. He is the best Mouser\r\nthat can be; for he leaves not one of that Vermin alive where he comes.\r\nHe also kills the Rattlesnake wherever he meets him by twisting his\r\nHead about the Neck of the Rattlesnake, and whipping him to Death with\r\nhis Tail. This Whipster, for all his Agility, is so brittle that when\r\nhe is pursued, and gets his Head into the Hole of a Tree, if anybody\r\ngets hold of the other End, he will twist and break himself in the\r\nMiddle.’\r\n\r\nLawson does not appear to have understood the nature of constrictors.\r\n‘Whipping’ the rattlesnake was probably only the tail lashed in anger,\r\nor used in controlling the exceedingly active movements of the captor.\r\nAs for its ‘breaking itself in halves,’ many exaggerated stories are\r\ntold by unscientific spectators of the ‘brittleness’ of snakes, the\r\nsimple explanation being that all are alike irritated and terrified\r\nwhen rendered helpless by their tail being fettered, and may then\r\nstruggle until they injure themselves. The common blindworm (_Anguis\r\nfragilis_) has been seen to so-call ‘break itself in halves;’ but this\r\nwill be explained in its place (chap. xxv.).\r\n\r\nThis sensitiveness—_sensibility_, one may almost term it—in the\r\ntail of snakes has been pointed out by the late Frank Buckland, Dr.\r\nStradling, and others of like practical experience, affording useful\r\ninformation in case of danger. ‘If attacked by a boa constrictor, it\r\nis of no use to pull and haul, but catch held of the tip of the tail\r\nand unwind him.’ Also, ‘when striking, aim at the tail. The spinal cord\r\nthere being only thinly covered with bone, it is more easily wounded;\r\nand when the spine is broken, the animal is disabled.’[58]\r\n\r\nCertain it is, that by the muscular power of the tail snakes perform\r\nwonderful feats, not only erecting themselves, and maintaining their\r\nbalance for a short time, as a long pole is balanced by an acrobat\r\non his chin or his nose; hanging by an inch or so of the tip, as an\r\nacrobat hangs for a time on one foot or one finger; raising themselves\r\nagainst a smooth surface, as you see the large pythons at the Gardens\r\ndo against the smooth sides or glass fronts of their cages, even to the\r\nvery top, but springing, ‘executing leaps,’ as Roget and others term\r\nit. For though the ‘leap’ is not strictly like the action of a frog or\r\na grasshopper, or a man whose two limbs act in concert and together,\r\nthe result is the same,—the reptile accomplishes a long distance with\r\nquickness, decision, and aim. Professor Owen[59] calls it a saltatory\r\nmotion, ‘the sudden extension of the coils of the body reacting upon\r\nthe point of earth on which the tail presses, throwing the serpent\r\nforward.’ Sometimes, when the creature lies closely coiled, the sudden\r\nunbending has the effect of a spiral spring; and occasionally, when\r\nthe tail is brought suddenly up to the head, and the serpent springs\r\nforward again, and continues to do this in pursuit, as has often been\r\nwitnessed, the effect is that of a rolling hoop, and has given rise to\r\na belief among the ignorant that the reptile really rolls along.\r\n\r\nOne in America, known as the ‘Hoop snake,’ is reported to ‘roll down\r\nhill,’ the idea originating possibly from the optical illusion in\r\nconsequence of the rapid changes of position—an effect which we see in\r\nthat amusing toy, the zoetrope.\r\n\r\nThe ‘black snake’ of Australia, _Hoplocephalus pseudechis_, is one of\r\nthe very active venomous kinds, whose motions in pursuit or escape are\r\nalmost like leaps, and present the appearance of a hoop or circle.\r\nReputed ‘hoop snakes’ are there also. The reptile rapidly extends\r\nitself to full length, then brings up its posterior portion in a loop,\r\nand so springs forward again, continuing to do this with amazing\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nThe most easy and natural convolutions of a snake are _lateral_. As\r\nclosely as their body can be coiled on a given space, as close as a\r\nribbon or a rope, they can curl themselves round sideways, that is,\r\nwith the ventral scales all prone to the ground, and the vertebral\r\ncolumn upwards; nor could they, from the construction of their spine,\r\ncoil themselves similarly in a vertical position, as a hedgehog and\r\na dormouse roll themselves up. But temporarily and partially they\r\n_can_ bend themselves vertically; for you see a snake often with a\r\npart of its body raised vertically against a wall, while the rest is\r\nhorizontally along the ground, and consequently one part is at right\r\nangles with the other part, and as the creature rises against the wall\r\nevery joint has in turn taken this position. Also, when coiled round\r\na branch, you do occasionally see that the curves are not invariably\r\nand unexceptionally lateral, but sometimes vertical, although not so\r\nclosely so as in the more natural coils. I have very narrowly observed\r\nthis, because the ‘hoop’-like motion is often ridiculed; but it seems\r\na not impossible action when a large circle is described by the body,\r\nthough close coils would be less possible.[60]\r\n\r\nA clergyman of Australia had a narrow escape from one of these\r\n‘rolling’ creatures. His daughter gave me an account of the\r\ncircumstance, she also, when a resident there, having been well\r\nacquainted with such scenes. Her father accidentally trod on one of\r\nthose dangerous serpents, which immediately made a spring at him,\r\nbut which he expertly eluded, and took to his heels with all speed,\r\nknowing the vicious nature of that snake. Looking back, he saw the\r\nreptile pursuing him with ‘strides’ or ‘bounds,’ stretching itself to\r\nfull length, then bringing up its tail and springing forward again\r\nwith terrific vigour. In its excitement it seemed almost to fly, now\r\ngaining on him, and now, as an occasional obstacle had to be avoided,\r\ngiving his victim some slight advantage. For the space of three whole\r\nfields, ‘paddocks,’ he was thus chased, he the while using his utmost\r\nspeed. His home was in the bush, and when, almost dropping with\r\nexcessive fatigue and terror, he came within sight of it, one of his\r\nfarm-servants saw him thus tearing along, and, guessing the cause,\r\nseized his gun, and hastened to meet the fugitive, and put an end to\r\nthe chase.\r\n\r\nDu Chaillu’s snakes were almost always ‘springing’ at him, and very\r\nprobably some of them did so. At the same time, most of his snakes had\r\n‘fangs’ as well; but then, in his ‘_Wild Life_’ he witnessed many other\r\nanomalies.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the most active are the non-venomous kinds; yet among\r\nthe venomous colubrines, the slender _elapidæ_, of which the above\r\nAustralian snake is one, we find much activity.\r\n\r\nMr. P. H. Gosse was struck with the amazing springing power of the\r\nyellow Jamaica boa (_Chilobothrus inornatus_), and by a similar use\r\nof its tail as a propelling power.[61] It rears itself up and leaps\r\nan incredible distance, he tells us; one covered nearly twenty feet\r\nin such a spring, but that was on the incline of a hill. He noticed\r\nanother suspending itself from a branch, not with its tail _curled_\r\nround, but with a mere tip of it lying longitudinally, pressure alone\r\nsupporting the reptile. The slightest contact suffices to maintain the\r\nhold.\r\n\r\nThere is still one more offending tail to describe. It belongs to a\r\nWest Indian relative of our own little ‘blindworm,’ bearing also the\r\nfamily name, and for more justifiable reasons, inasmuch as the eyes\r\nof the Jamaica species really are not easily distinguished. It is\r\nworm-like in aspect, and of about the same size as _Anguis fragilis_,\r\nsimilarly smooth and polished, and so active that it is difficult to\r\nhold it. _Typhlops lumbricalis_ is its name, the first word signifying\r\nblind, and the second worm-like. It moves backwards and forwards with\r\nequal facility, and is therefore commonly called the ‘two-headed\r\nsnake.’ The coloured people are dreadfully afraid of its short blunt\r\ntail, which they think can ‘sting,’ and which terminates in a minute\r\nhorny nipple on a shining round plate or scale. Being a burrowing\r\nsnake, this hard, protected tail is of great use as a fulcrum; but when\r\noff the ground, taken up by the hand, for instance, the little shining\r\nworm makes still further use of its tail, as its English cousin does,\r\npressing the tip firmly against the fingers, or whatever surface is\r\nnear it, to support itself, and to the terror of those who hold it, and\r\nwho forthwith dash it down, though it is wholly powerless to injure.\r\n\r\nIn Australia it has some allies, whose tails are remarkably developed\r\ninto this useful point. The reptiles being as round as rulers and as\r\nsmooth, the difficulty of progression without this aid as a fulcrum\r\nwill be evident. Below are three tails, which will suffice to\r\nexemplify their purpose and utility.\r\n\r\nA curious modification is seen in the centre tail, belonging to\r\n_Uropeltis philippinus_, which, as the name implies, terminates in a\r\nround disk or shield. This snake is also one of the smooth cylindrical\r\nforms, ‘admirably adapted to burrowing,’ says Dr. Günther. Its\r\ntruncated appearance is as if it were chopped clean in halves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tails of three burrowing snakes.]\r\n\r\nAnother is the _Cylindrophis_, from its form. Several of the burrowing\r\nfamily are remarkable for a similarity of head and tail, obscure\r\nfeatures, inconspicuous eyes, and very small mouth, rendering it\r\ndifficult on first sight to decide which is the head and which the\r\ntail. All being feeble, inoffensive, and entirely harmless, the evil\r\nattached to them of having ‘two heads’ is only another proof of the\r\nprejudice and animosity displayed towards every creature in the shape\r\nof a snake, however innocent. These poor little ‘blindworms,’ admirably\r\norganized to dig and burrow and find their food in deep and hidden\r\nplaces, have their uses. In countries where dangerous ants swarm, we\r\nmight well tremble for the consequences, had not nature anticipated\r\nsuch evils by providing insectivorous reptiles, as well as birds and\r\nant-eaters, to keep them in check.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit one other of the family of burrowing snakes, which\r\nfrom the very earliest ages has been supposititiously endowed with two\r\nheads. Its name, _Amphisbæna_, or ‘double-walker’ (going both ways),\r\nhowever, is well merited, because, like _Typhlops_, it can progress\r\neither way, forwards or backwards, with equal facility. This is the one\r\nalluded to by Catesby (p. 174). We can comprehend the advantage of the\r\nretrogressing power to these otherwise unprotected little reptiles,\r\nwhen they cautiously peep from their narrow burrow in the ground, and\r\nespy one of their many enemies in the shape of a much larger ophidian,\r\nor a carnivorous bird. Quick as thought, back they glide, and are safe.\r\nLiving chiefly among the ants, on which they feed, their cuirass of\r\nhard, polished, close-set scales protects them from a bite or sting.\r\nAnother beautiful provision of nature is, that the young ones, on being\r\nhatched, find food ready at hand—at mouth, rather—the eggs having\r\nbeen laid, or the young ones born, in the nest of the ants.\r\n\r\nOf this harmless and useful reptile, Pliny seriously wrote: ‘The\r\namphisbæna has two heads; that is, it has a second one at its tail, as\r\nthough one mouth were too little for the discharge of all its venom!’\r\n\r\nEven at the present day this belief in ‘two heads,’ or ‘two tails,’ and\r\n‘death at both ends,’ is not wholly eradicated, and not merely among\r\nthe lower classes either.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to say that when two heads have really appeared—and\r\nthere are several such cases on record—they are simply monstrosities,\r\nmalformations, as found in other animals occasionally. An example of\r\nthis kind may be seen at the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.\r\nAnother was described by Frank Buckland in _Land and Water_, April\r\n1872. It was sent to him by his friend Dr. Bowerbank of St. Leonard’s.\r\n\r\nA curious jumble of the _Amphisbæna_ and the Cobra, with its elevated\r\nand expanded neck, is found in the _Philosophical Transactions_, vol.\r\niii. p. 863, for 1665. There had been a correspondence on the subject\r\nof two heads, and a reader was evidently sceptical, for the writer thus\r\nprotests that he is telling the truth:—\r\n\r\n‘There are indeed such Serpents in these Parts (Java Naja) which have\r\nan Head on each End of their Body, called _Capra capella_. They are\r\nesteemed Sacred by these People, and fortunate to those in whose House\r\nand Lands they are found; but pernicious to whomsoever doth them Harm.’\r\n\r\nThis credulous gentleman writes from the East, and cannot corroborate\r\nwhat he has been told by a personal acquaintance with even an\r\nAmphisbæna, which might really deceive a casual observer. But that\r\nthe belief prevailed extensively prior to this, we find from a\r\ndistinguished physician of his day, F. Hermandez, or Fernandez, who, in\r\nhis work, _Animalium Mexicanum_, 1628, represents a creature that would\r\nfill one of these pages, with two heads like a ram with wattles and\r\nother ample appendages, and distinguishes it as _Amphisbæna Europæa_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Amphisbæna Europæa._]\r\n\r\n‘It is not for us to question the Ancients,’ says the much too\r\nmodest author, betraying a lurking misgiving as to the reality of\r\nthe creature, but nevertheless doing his best to represent it as his\r\nimagination depicts it. It is here much reduced in size, but may be\r\nfound on p. 797 of the above very interesting volume.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Browne includes this among his ‘Vulgar Errours,’ and traces\r\nit to Nicander, Galen, and other classic writers, but to ‘Ælian\r\nmost confidently.’ He discusses the creature with dispassionate\r\nintelligence, and shows us that ‘poets have been more reasonable than\r\nphilosophers’ about it.[62] Again, if such a thing there were, it were\r\nnot to be obtruded by the name of _Amphisbæna_, or as an animal of one\r\ndenomination, with a duplicity of hearts and heads,’ he argues, giving\r\nhonour to the head, and therefore that the creature must be dual.\r\n\r\nThere are frequently some of the smooth, ruler-like snakes in our\r\nLondon Reptilium; their very small eyes and mouth, and blunt, shapeless\r\nhead, render it difficult to decide at the moment between head and\r\ntail. Any with sheep’s heads we are not likely to see, and those that\r\nhave had the malformation of two reptilian heads generally present\r\nsomething of two necks as well. The writers, however, whom we have\r\nquoted were not thinking of monstrosities, but had profound faith in a\r\nveritable _Amphisbæna Europæa_, which an artist with an unscientific\r\nimagination has handed down to posterity!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n_OPHIDIAN ACROBATS: CONSTRUCTION AND CONSTRICTION._\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE discussing the most remarkable of all ophidian caudal\r\nappendages, the _Crotalus_ rattle, and the many speculations regarding\r\nit, we will enumerate some other acrobatic achievements of which snakes\r\nare capable; as, in accounting for these, some interesting facts\r\nappertaining to their anatomical structure can be described.\r\n\r\nA humorous journalist has said, ‘There is apparently nothing that a\r\nsnake can _not_ do, except swallow a porcupine.’[63] Presuming that\r\nhe alludes to physical feats, he is not far from wrong. For all that,\r\nthe Western pioneers of America tell us of yet one more thing that\r\nthese reptiles cannot accomplish, and that is, cross over a rope\r\nof horse-hair. Having by accident discovered that they turn aside\r\nfrom this, some Western settlers, when camping out, have effectually\r\nentrenched themselves within a circle of horse-hair rope as a barrier\r\nto rattlesnakes while sleeping.\r\n\r\nLet us try to account for this.\r\n\r\nMany of my readers have seen the cast-off coat of a snake. Those who\r\nhave not can have the pleasure of examining one or several the next\r\ntime they go to the Zoological Gardens, where the obliging keeper\r\nwill cheerfully exhibit them. Others at a distance may not enjoy this\r\nfacility, and for these the accompanying diagrams may be a slight\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of slough of a rattlesnake (exact size).\r\n\r\nVentral scales of the same, and a section.]\r\n\r\nThe whole cuticle or epidermis of a serpent is composed of these\r\noverlapping scales, of which the above illustrations are only\r\nfragments. Thus when we speak of their _scales_, we do not mean\r\ndistinct and separable laminæ, like the scales of some fishes, each\r\nof which may be scraped or plucked off, and which overlie each other\r\nlike the feathers of birds. The covering of a snake is one entire\r\npiece, loose-fitting, and so arranged as to lie in those scale-like\r\nfolds which accommodate themselves to every movement of the body. The\r\nventral or under scales are, in fact, a regular kilting, as may be seen\r\nby the section; and the upper ones correspond somewhat with what our\r\nlady friends call the shell or the leaf pattern in knitting work. The\r\nouter or exposed folds are stronger, thicker, and more hardened than\r\nthe inner parts, just as the knitter ‘throws up’ her pattern with a\r\ncoarser wool or larger needles, and knits the less conspicuous parts in\r\na softer material. The naked space of thinner skin between these scales\r\nbeing very considerable, one can therefore easily understand how,\r\nwhen a snake would attempt to pass over a horse-hair rope, the sharp,\r\nprickly hairs, standing out _chevaux-de-frise_ fashion, would insinuate\r\nthemselves unpleasantly in those softer and more vulnerable interstices\r\nwhich become exposed by the sinuations of the body. Probably, if we\r\nknew it, or had an opportunity of observing, we should ascertain that\r\nsnakes do not crawl over furze bushes, or thistles, or the prickly pear\r\n(_opuntia_), or any similar vegetation of tropical climates, and for\r\nthe same reason. The close-scaled burrowing snakes, with their hard\r\nand strong cuirass all round them, might have nothing to fear from a\r\nfurze bush; but this is mere speculation. That fine, sharp spines or\r\nprickles, and therefore a horse-hair rope, would incommode the tender\r\nintermediate epidermal folds of other snakes, we can well suppose. Had\r\nthey sense enough to _leap_ the obstacle, this they could easily do,\r\nafter the manner of ‘leaping’ already described; but the ‘leap’ is only\r\nan instinctive action used in pursuit or escape; and it may be equally\r\ninstinctive to turn aside from uncomfortable obstacles, whether prickly\r\npears or horse-hair ropes.\r\n\r\nMr. Ruskin, in his highly-entertaining lecture on ‘Snakes,’ at the\r\nLondon Institution, March 1880 (a lecture which, by the way, was\r\nartistic, poetic, figurative, imaginative—‘Snakes’ from a Ruskin, but\r\nnot a zoological, point of view), remarked ‘that no scientific book\r\ntells us why the reptile _is_ a “serpent,” _i.e._ serpentine in its\r\nmotions, and why it cannot go straight.’ Now, may not the fact that\r\nsnakes have acquired these ever-varying sinuations arise from their\r\nsensitiveness to the slightest, and what would be to other creatures\r\nalmost impalpable, obstructions in their path?—mere inequalities which\r\nin their lazy nature it is easier, they know not why, to circumvent\r\nthan to surmount; because they _can_ go straight, and _do_ go straight\r\nwhen the way is plain.\r\n\r\nRymer Jones, in his _Organization of the Animal Kingdom_, thinks that\r\ntheir sense of touch from the nature of their integument must be\r\nextremely imperfect; they being ‘deprived of any limbs which can be\r\nregarded as tactile organs,’ p. 753. But close observation leads one\r\nto agree rather with a much older writer, Roget, who, in his _Animal\r\nPhysiology_, intimates that the peculiar conformation of serpents must\r\nbe exceedingly favourable to the acquisition of correct perceptions of\r\ntouch, and that these perceptions which lead to a perfect acquaintance\r\nwith the tangible properties of surrounding bodies must contribute much\r\nto the sagacity of snakes;—that their whole body is a hand, conferring\r\nsome of the advantages of that instrument.\r\n\r\nThat this latter faculty is strictly and marvellously the case, we\r\nshall presently see, owing to the flexibility of the spine, and its\r\ncapability of grasping and twining round objects of almost any shape,\r\nand of taking, as Roget says, ‘their exact measure.’ For this grasping\r\npower is not confined to the constricting snakes only. In all snakes\r\na great flexibility is abundantly provided for in the construction\r\nof ‘these lithe and elegant beings,’ as Rymer Jones in unprejudiced\r\nlanguage calls them (p. 724 of the book above quoted); ‘the spinal\r\ncolumn admits the utmost pliancy of motion in any required direction.’\r\n\r\nThough snakes have no limbs externally, ‘the work of hands, feet, and\r\nfins is performed by a modification of the vertebral column.’[64]\r\n‘Except flying, there is no limit to their locomotion,’ said Professor\r\nHuxley in _his_ lecture on ‘Snakes,’ a few weeks previously to that of\r\nRuskin, and under the same roof. To both these lectures we shall again\r\nrefer, as the reader will feel sure that all coming from such sources\r\nmust add value to the present writer’s arguments.\r\n\r\nAs ‘flying,’ the swift motions of many snakes have been described by\r\nancient writers, as, for example, the ‘flying serpents’ of Scripture,\r\nthough these are by many supposed to be the _Dracunculi_, the earliest\r\nknown of human parasites. The astonishing movements of serpents were,\r\nhowever, in superstitious ages ascribed to supernatural agency. Says\r\nPliny: ‘The Jaculus darts from trees, flies through the air as if\r\nit were hurled from an engine.’ The ‘wisest of men’ admitted that\r\nthe actions of serpents were beyond his comprehension; ‘the way of a\r\nserpent on a rock’ was ‘too wonderful’ for him.\r\n\r\nEven in intermediate ages, when travellers and naturalists began to\r\nconfront fiction with fact, even in the days of Buffon and Lacepède,\r\na serpent was regarded as a living allegory rather than a zoological\r\nreality by many intelligent, albeit unscientific persons. Of such\r\nwas Chateaubriand, whose contemplation of the serpent partook of\r\nreligious awe. ‘Everything is mysterious, secret, astonishing in this\r\nincomprehensible reptile. His movements differ from those of all\r\nother animals. It is impossible to say where his locomotive principle\r\nlies, for he has neither fins, nor feet, nor wings; and yet he flits\r\nlike a shadow, he vanishes as if by magic, he reappears, and is gone\r\nagain like a light azure vapour on the gleams of a sabre in the dark.\r\nNow he curls himself into a circle, and projects a tongue of fire;\r\nnow standing erect upon the extremity of his tail he moves as if by\r\nenchantment. He rolls himself into a ball, rises and falls like a\r\nspiral line, gives to his rings the undulations of a wave, twines round\r\nthe branches of trees, glides under the grass of the meadow, or skims\r\nalong the surface of the water,’ and so forth.[65]\r\n\r\nExcepting the ‘tongue of fire,’ the whole of this poetic description is\r\nso far true and unexaggerated, that Chateaubriand has not attributed\r\nto the reptile one action of which it is not capable, and which, to\r\nthe untutored mind, might well seem supernatural. Roget, Schlegel,\r\nHuxley, and others tell us the same things in the language of science.\r\nTo quote them all is impossible; the reader will be content with one\r\nscientific assurance of ophidian capabilities, not less poetic than\r\nChateaubriand’s.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen, in describing the bony structure of the Ophidia,\r\nand in allusion to the scriptural text—‘Upon thy belly shalt thou\r\ngo’—affirms that so far from the reptiles being degraded from a higher\r\ntype, their whole organization demonstrates how exquisitely their parts\r\nare adapted to their necessities, and thus proceeds: ‘They can outclimb\r\nthe monkey, outswim the fish, outleap the jerboa, and suddenly loosing\r\nthe coils of their crouching spiral, they can spring into the air and\r\nseize the bird upon its wing.’\r\n\r\nThe active snakes can always ‘leap’ their own length, whether upwards\r\nto seize a bird, or horizontally, and, as in the case of the Jamaica\r\nboa (described p. 186), can leap much farther from a similar impetus\r\nwhen the direction is _downwards_. Indeed, they can let themselves fall\r\nfrom a certain elevation with an additional impetus to progress, as a\r\nboy first runs in order to leap a ditch.\r\n\r\n‘With neither hands nor talons, they can out-wrestle the athlete,\r\nand crush their prey in the embrace of their ponderous, overlapping\r\nfolds.... Instead of licking up its food as it glides along, the\r\nserpent uplifts its crushed prey, and presents it grasped in its\r\ndeath-like coil, as in a hand, to its gaping mouth.’[66]\r\n\r\nA similarly graphic account is given by Rymer Jones, p. 718 of his\r\nwork,[67] that will be read with interest by those who wish to pursue\r\nthe study scientifically.\r\n\r\nIn watching the larger constricting snakes while feeding, you see\r\nhow _dexterously_ they manage.—(One may use this word here, because\r\nthose above quoted, ‘as in a hand,’ are literally, scientifically\r\ntrue; therefore we may suppose fingers as well as a hand, and say how\r\ndexterously the creatures bring their coils to their aid.)\r\n\r\nThey have quickly strangled and begun to eat, say an opossum or\r\na turkey buzzard, when a part of the prey not swallowed offers\r\nsome impediment to the expanded jaws; the wings or legs may be\r\ninconveniently extended, or have become wedged between some immoveable\r\nobstacles—a log, a narrow space, or under a portion of themselves.\r\nTheir mouth, the only apparent grasping agent, is already occupied, and\r\na strain sufficiently powerful, while the jaws are thus retaining the\r\nprey, would be painful to the feeder, might even drag back the food,\r\nto the injury of the engaged teeth. How does the reptile proceed in\r\nthis emergency? With the lightness and deftness of enormous strength,\r\nit applies two folds of its body, two loops of its own coils, and with\r\nthem drags forth, lifts up, or otherwise adjusts its prey in a more\r\nconvenient position—in fact, ‘presents it as in a hand’ to its own\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable instance of a constricting snake thus using its\r\ncoils is related by Dr. Elliott Coues, of the United States army,\r\nlate surgeon and naturalist to the United States Northern Boundary\r\nCommission. He witnessed one of those frequent combats between the\r\nRacer and the Rattlesnake, in which the former—and in far less time\r\nthan it takes to read one line of this page—threw two folds or coils\r\nround his adversary, one coil of the anterior portion of his own body\r\nround one part, and a second coil of the posterior portion of his own\r\nbody round another part, and then, by a sudden extension of himself,\r\ntore the rattlesnake in halves. And this was done with greater ease\r\nand swiftness than we could snap a thread which we must first secure\r\nround the fingers of our two hands. As if indeed possessed of two\r\nhands, the constrictor snapped his foe in twain. This is Lawson’s\r\n‘Whipster,’ p. 182.\r\n\r\nThe coiling of the constricting snakes is like lightning; you cannot\r\nfollow the movements. In this case death must have been instantaneous,\r\nand indeed it is doubtful whether any beast or bird of prey puts his\r\nvictim to a more speedy and less torturing death than the constrictors\r\nwhen following their own instincts.\r\n\r\nRepairing to the Zoological Gardens in the hope of witnessing the\r\nwonderful adaptation of coils to manual uses, after reading what\r\nRoget and Owen had affirmed, one soon had a favourable opportunity\r\nin watching a python. It was, I think, in June 1874, and the poor\r\npython had a ruptured side. In spite of which—as my zoological notes\r\nrecord—‘it helped by the folds of its body to get the wings of the\r\nduck down flat and close, so as to swallow it more easily. With reason\r\ndoes Roget say, “Its whole body is a hand,” for it used its loops to\r\nhold and to push and to flatten in a manner truly intelligent.’\r\n\r\nSuch was my first entry and observation. Subsequently, and indeed\r\nalmost on every feeding day, the same kind of thing was to be seen at\r\nthe Gardens. Many such examples are recorded in my notebook; but of\r\nthese one or two later notes will suffice to illustrate the subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘Totsey,’ a python born in the Gardens, June 30, 1877,\r\ntaking her supper, Sept. 24, 1880.]\r\n\r\nA young python was hanging from a branch, more than half its body\r\ncurved as in the accompanying sketch, remaining motionless and\r\nquiescent, watching some sparrows which the keeper had just put into\r\nthe cage. The birds, eyeing certain insects among the gravel, seemed\r\nall unconscious of the pair of glistening eyes looking down upon them.\r\nSuddenly a movement, a flicker, like the flash of a whip, and the snake\r\nhad changed its position. Too quick for us to follow the motion, but in\r\nthat flash of time it now hung like a pendulum, with a sparrow almost\r\nhidden in its coils. The snake had precisely measured its distance,\r\nreached down, and recoiled with the swiftness of an elastic spring.\r\nAfter a few minutes, _feeling_ that its prey was dead, it prepared to\r\nswallow it, holding it encircled in a portion of its body, while the\r\nhead was free to commence the usual examination. Still hanging there,\r\nit held and devoured the bird.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, one of the larger pythons caught a guinea-pig\r\nin the same manner. This also was so quick in its movements that one\r\nscarcely knew what had happened until the snake was seen to have\r\nchanged its position, some of the anterior coils had embraced a\r\nsomething, and a quadruped was missing. This snake also still hung\r\nwhile eating its meal, the whole process occupying less than ten\r\nminutes. In both these cases we saw the prehensile tail in its natural\r\nuse, while the rest of the body was free for action.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable cases of what we may call independent\r\nconstricting powers, that is, two or more parts of the reptile being\r\nengaged at the same time, was in some very hungry, or very greedy, or\r\nvery sagacious little constrictors, the ‘four-rayed snakes,’ _Elaphis\r\nquater-radiatus_.\r\n\r\nThey are slender for their length, which may be from three to five\r\nfeet, of an inconspicuous colour, but with two black lines on each\r\nside, running the whole length of their body; hence their name,\r\n‘four-lined,’ or ‘four-rayed.’ In the present instance, there were in\r\nthe same cage three of these, also one young royal python, one small\r\ncommon boa, and one ‘thick-necked tree boa’ (_Epicratis cenchris_), all\r\nconstrictors. The day was close and warm for April, and the snakes,\r\nreviving from their winter torpor, seemed particularly active and\r\nlively. Probably they had not fed much of late, and thought now was\r\ntheir opportunity, for the keeper no sooner threw the birds—finches,\r\nand plenty of them for all—into the cage, than there was a general\r\nscuffle. Each of the six snakes seized its bird and entwined it,\r\nthen on the part of the reptiles all was comparatively still. The\r\nrest of the poor little birds, fluttering hither and thither, were,\r\nhowever, not disregarded, for although each snake was constricting its\r\ncaptive, several of them captured another bird by pressing it beneath\r\nthem, and holding it down with a disengaged part of themselves. One\r\nof the four-rayed snakes felt its held-down victim struggling, and\r\ninstantaneously a second coil was thrown round it. Then another caught\r\na second bird in its mouth, for its head and neck were not occupied\r\nwith the bird already held, and in order to have coils at its disposal,\r\nslipped down its first captive, or rather passed itself onwards to\r\nconstrict the second, the earlier coils not changing in form in the\r\nslightest degree, any more than a ring passed down a cord would change\r\nits form. The next moment I saw one of those two hungry ones with\r\nthree birds under its control. It had already begun to eat the first,\r\na second was coiled about eight inches behind, and a good deal of\r\nthe posterior portion of the reptile was still disengaged when a bird\r\npassed across its tail, and instantly that was captured. All this was\r\ndone by a sense of feeling only, as the snakes did not once turn their\r\nheads. Two of these ‘four-rayed’ snakes were so close together, so\r\nrapid in their movements, so excited and eager for their prey, that\r\nwhich of them first began his bird, and which one caught the third, it\r\nis impossible to affirm confidently.\r\n\r\nWhenever either of them was in the same position for one quiet minute,\r\na few hurried strokes of the pencil fixed them in my notebook, and of\r\nthe hasty though faithful sketches thus made, I present three to the\r\nreader on the opposite page.\r\n\r\nApril 1st, 1881.—After this date nothing more was to be seen!\r\nHenceforth visitors were to be excluded, and the reptiles were to be\r\nfed _after sunset_.\r\n\r\nNow, however painfully and sympathetically we may regard those poor\r\nlittle birds so unceremoniously seized, crushed, and devoured, we can\r\nbut reverently, and almost with awe, admire the astonishing facility\r\nwith which these limbless, toolless reptiles provide themselves\r\nwith food. With still deeper awe and reverence we shall admire when\r\nwe examine their anatomical structure, and see by what marvellous\r\ndevelopment it has been adapted to their necessities.\r\n\r\nWe feel sadly for the finches, it is true; because finches are often\r\nour pets, and are sweet songsters. Were a toad or a rat thus treated,\r\nwe should care less, perhaps; because there is as much repugnance\r\ntowards toads and ‘vermin,’ as towards snakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First bird caught and a second held down.\r\n\r\nFirst bird dead, the second coiled, and a third bird caught.\r\n\r\nFirst bird half eaten, two others in coils.\r\n\r\n_April 1st, 1881._]\r\n\r\nBut if the finches did not become the prey of snakes, they would become\r\nthe victims of bird-catchers and milliners; and if they escaped these\r\nwanton spoilers, they would fall victims to birds of prey, as much\r\nlarger birds fall victims to our own need of food.\r\n\r\nReptiles also have existence and requirements, and an organization\r\nadapted to such requirements. This should be their claim upon our\r\ntolerance; and if they do not win our admiration, we cannot deny them\r\nthe right to live, the right to feed according to their instincts,\r\nand to secure their natural food in their own way, which—begging the\r\nreader to pardon this feeble moralizing—we find to be a very wonderful\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThough the term ‘reptile’ is applied to a whole tribe of crawling\r\ncreatures, whether four-legged or limbless, that are covered with\r\nscales, horny plates, or a skin more or less hardened, imbricated, or\r\nrugose (viz. crocodiles, lizards, frogs, toads, serpents, and their\r\ncongeners), snakes are more truly reptiles, being limbless, from\r\n_repo_, to creep. Hence serpents (from _serpo_, to creep, and its\r\nderivatives serpentine, serpentize, etc., from _serpens_, winding)\r\nhave been separated from the rest. The true serpents, therefore, are\r\nthose without feet, and which move only close to the ground, by the\r\nsinuations of their body.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the constricting snakes use this body as a substitute\r\nfor hands, literally _managing_ with it; but though they are externally\r\nlegless, and _apodal_ (without feet), the truth is that few creatures,\r\nnone perhaps, not even millipedes, are more liberally furnished with\r\nlegs and feet than serpents. One curious exception to general rules is,\r\nthat while other creatures have the same number of feet as legs, that\r\nis, one foot to each leg, a snake has only one foot to each pair of\r\nlegs!\r\n\r\nMany of my observant readers have already discovered for themselves\r\nwhere and what these numerous legs and feet are. In the early days of\r\nmy ophidian studies, which then consisted chiefly of observations, I\r\nnoticed the action of limbs beneath the skin of the pythons as they\r\nmoved about, and more particularly when they were climbing up the glass\r\nin front of their cages, and as in the case of the glottis, I thought\r\nI had made a grand discovery; and so I had, as far as myself was\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nDeductions from personal observation, which in the history of many\r\nsciences have again and again been claimed as original discoveries by\r\nrival thinkers or experimentalists, no doubt _were_ original on the\r\npart of each.\r\n\r\nProbably, also, many other persons have noticed this leg-like action\r\nof the ribs, but who, not being specially interested in snakeology,\r\nhave never troubled themselves to ascertain ‘further particulars,’ or\r\ncared whether any one else had observed this or not. But it _is_ a very\r\nevident and unmistakeable action, and one quite worth studying on your\r\nnext visit to the Reptilium.\r\n\r\nBooks on ophiology tell us that Sir Joseph Banks was the first to\r\nobserve this limb-like action of the ribs. Sir Everard—then Mr.—Home,\r\nF.R.S, and the most distinguished anatomist of his time, was, however,\r\nthe first to publish a scientific description of the fact; his account\r\nand the illustrations accompanying it having been subsequently adopted\r\nby most ophiologists.\r\n\r\nIn vol. cii. of the _Philosophical Transactions_ of 1812, p. 163, is a\r\npaper which was read before the Royal Society in February of that year,\r\nby Everard Home, Esq., F.R.S. It is entitled, ‘Observations to show\r\nthat the Progressive Motion of Snakes is partly performed by the Ribs.’\r\n\r\nWe give his introductory words, not only because the ‘discovery’ was\r\na great event in the history of ophiology, but as showing that to see\r\nand examine a foreign snake was at that time a rare if not a novel\r\noccurrence. He tells us that on a former occasion in 1804, he had\r\ndescribed the anterior ribs of a cobra, those which form the ‘hood.’ At\r\nthat time he was ‘not in possession of the bodies of snakes,’ so that\r\nhe could compare their structure, but had _since_ found out a good deal\r\nmore about their anatomy, and then he proceeds: ‘A Coluber of unusual\r\nsize lately brought to London to be exhibited, was shown to Sir Joseph\r\nBanks. The animal was lively and moved along the carpet briskly; while\r\nit was doing so, Sir Joseph thought he saw the ribs come forward in\r\nsuccession, like the feet of a caterpillar. This remark he immediately\r\ncommunicated to me, and gave me an opportunity of seeing the snake\r\nand making my own observations. The fact was already established, and\r\nI could feel the ribs with my fingers as they were brought forward.\r\nI placed my hand under the snake, and the ribs were felt distinctly\r\nupon the palm as the animal passed over it. This becomes the more\r\ninteresting discovery as it constitutes a new species of progressive\r\nmotion, and one widely different from those already known.’\r\n\r\nThe ‘unusually large Coluber’ was probably a python. Had a previous\r\nopportunity presented itself to this scientific and thoughtful\r\nobserver, Sir Joseph Banks might not have been the one to carry off\r\nthe palm in this discovery. Home had already described the peculiarity\r\nof the cobra’s anterior ribs (chap. xviii.), and, as already suggested,\r\nit is scarcely possible to watch one of those larger constrictors\r\n_without_ perceiving the mode of progression. We shall see in the\r\ncourse of this book that snake observers have arrived at the same\r\nconclusions on several points, while wholly ignorant of what others had\r\nsaid or decided regarding the same.\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter the number of vertebræ forming the spinal\r\ncolumn of three or four snakes was given, but this number varies\r\ngreatly, not only in snakes but in species. In some species there are\r\nabove 400 vertebræ or joints in a snake’s spine. But here is a puzzle\r\nthat baffles the student. ‘Every one knows,’ says Schlegel, ‘that their\r\nnumber differs’ (speaking of the vertebræ), ‘not only according to the\r\nspecies, but also in individuals, so that sometimes we find in serpents\r\nof the same species a difference of thirty or forty vertebræ more or\r\nless.’[68]\r\n\r\nTaking this literally according to the text, one might expect to find\r\none ring-snake in a family of ten measuring two feet, while his brother\r\nmeasured two yards, and a third four feet, and so on, as if each had a\r\ndifferent number of vertebræ.\r\n\r\n‘The same species,’ that is, two anacondas or two cobras! ‘A\r\nmistranslation,’ one naturally decided, and proceeded to consult the\r\noriginal. But no. The translator had faithfully and unquestioningly\r\nfollowed the original French; but the fact was so irreconcilable that I\r\nsought Dr. Günther’s kind assistance in comprehending the passage.\r\n\r\n‘Evidently an oversight. Manifestly impossible,’ that learned authority\r\nat once decided. (As Schlegel stands high as a scientific ophiologist,\r\nthe misprint is pointed out for the benefit of future students.)\r\n\r\nThus lengths, _as to the number of vertebræ_, vary in species of the\r\nsame genus, but _not_ in ‘individuals of the same species.’ And this\r\nalone is sufficiently perplexing.\r\n\r\nFor example, we read in one work that a rattlesnake has 194 vertebræ,\r\nand in another that ‘it,’ viz. ‘a rattlesnake,’ has 207 vertebræ. Both\r\nequally correct, because two distinct species are described. Again,\r\nDr. Carpenter, in his _Animal Physiology_ (edition of 1872), gives a\r\ntable of the vertebræ of various animals, in which ‘a python’ has 422\r\njoints, while Owen gives ‘a python’ 291 joints, each learned anatomist\r\nhaving examined a different species. By these facts we comprehend what\r\nSchlegel intended to say.\r\n\r\nThe little constrictors caught their finches with five feet of body\r\nat their disposal. An anaconda, with five yards of body to work with,\r\nmight with equal ease coil three opossums.\r\n\r\n‘The skeleton of a snake exhibits the greatest possible simplicity\r\nto which a vertebrate animal can be reduced,’ says Roget. It is\r\n‘merely a lengthened spinal column.’ It is ‘simple’ in the same way\r\nthat botanists call a stem simple when it has no branches, or bracts,\r\nor leaves, to interrupt its uniformity. For this reason, having no\r\nlimbs, and therefore none of those bones which in quadrupeds connect\r\nthe limbs to the trunk, the spine is, in unscientific language, alike\r\nall the way down; ‘_un corps tout en tronc_.’ And because those two\r\nfirst joints of the spine which have no ribs attached to them are in\r\nform precisely like the other joints, physiologists tell us that a\r\nsnake has ‘no neck.’ By way of simplifying matters we just now called\r\nthose two joints an invariable neck. But in the way of _cervical_ or\r\nneck vertebræ, however, we must bear in mind that a true anatomical\r\nneck, in the eyes of science, a snake has not. Some of the four-legged\r\nreptiles have a true neck, that is, they have cervical vertebræ which\r\ndiffer from dorsal, lumbar, etc. vertebræ, as we ourselves and mammals\r\nin general have; because four-legged reptiles have a breast-bone and\r\nlimbs to support, and their neck varies in length. For example, a\r\ntortoise has nine cervical or neck joints, a monitor lizard six, and a\r\nsalamander only one.\r\n\r\nBut so also do the necks of mammals vary very greatly _in length_,\r\nwhile all, without exception, are formed of seven joints, _only seven\r\nvertebræ_; a man, a whale, a giraffe, and a mouse possess each seven\r\ncervical vertebræ, different in form from the rest of the joints of the\r\nspinal column. We might say that in appearance a whale has no neck,\r\nbut its seven neck joints are flat and close as seven cards or seven\r\npennies, while those of the giraffe are extraordinarily prolonged; and\r\nin ourselves—well, of course, the reader will admit the perfection\r\nof symmetry in our own necks, and the seven joints, therefore, are\r\nprecisely of the proper size.\r\n\r\nWhile the spine of a snake is ‘simple’ in respect of its joints being\r\nall formed on the same plan, it is the reverse of simple in its\r\nwonderfully complex structure. Professor Huxley, in his delightful\r\nlecture, said that ‘the most beautiful piece of anatomy he knew was\r\nthe vertebra of a snake.’ Professor Owen thus anatomically describes\r\nit: ‘The vertebræ of serpents articulate with each other by eight\r\njoints, in addition to those of the cup and ball on the centrum; and\r\ninterlock by parts reciprocally receiving and entering one another,\r\nlike the joints called tenon and mortice in carpentry’ (_Anatomy of the\r\nVertebrates_, p. 54).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Front and back view of a vertebra.]\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that each of these highly complicated joints supports\r\na pair of moveable ribs, and that the ends of these ribs are connected\r\nby muscles with the large stiff scutes or scales crossing the under\r\nsurface of the body (see illustrations, p. 193), which move with the\r\nribs, one foot-like scale to each pair, we comprehend how snakes exceed\r\nmillipedes in the number of their _limbs_, if not true legs, and how\r\nthey excel the insect also in variety of movement. Those ‘ball and\r\nsocket’ joints admit of free lateral flexion, and every variety of\r\ncurvature—‘_the utmost pliancy of motion_,’ to repeat the words of\r\nRymer Jones; and also of that surprisingly independent motion which\r\nenables the constrictors to surpass even the _Bimana_ (except practised\r\nexperts) in doing _several things at once_.\r\n\r\nThoughtful persons who can contemplate this wondrous organization with\r\ndue reverence, and witness it in activity—as we admiringly observe the\r\nworks of a watch in motion—will forget to censure those who supply\r\nfood to this piece of animated mechanism, and even pardon a hungry\r\nlittle snake for so expertly securing three birds at once.\r\n\r\nThink of 300 back-bones and 300 pairs of legs, all requiring wholesome\r\nexercise. Some snakes have 300 pairs of ribs—each pair capable of\r\nindependent motion, and articulated with that complex spine; and each\r\npair moving together, and carrying along with them a foot in the shape\r\nof a broad ventral scale. ‘This scutum by its posterior edge lays hold\r\nof the ground,’ says Sir Everard Home, ‘and becomes a fixed point\r\nwhence to set out anew.’\r\n\r\nThe hold which the ventral scales have of the ground obviously renders\r\nit easier for the reptiles to pass over a rough than a smooth surface;\r\nwhat are obstacles to other creatures are facilities to them. But they\r\nappear to be never at a loss. On a boarded room, or even a marble\r\nfloor, they will manage progression of some sort,—many by the pressure\r\nof the tail to push themselves forward, and others with an action that\r\ncan be compared only with swimming. With the same rapid, undulating\r\nmotion as swimming, the active snakes skim through the grass, or over\r\nsoft herbage, on which they seem to make no impression. Their swift\r\nsinuations are almost invisible to the eye. You only know that a snake\r\n_was_ there, and now has vanished. The ‘Rat’ snake of Ceylon (_Ptyas\r\nmucosus_) (see frontispiece) and the ‘Pilot’ snakes of America are\r\namong the best known of these swift-flitting or gliding creatures.\r\n\r\nRats are fleet little quadrupeds, but their enemies, the Rat snakes\r\nof India, are more than their match. Sir Emerson Tennant, in his\r\n_History of Ceylon_, describes an encounter with one. _Ptyas mucosus_\r\ncaught a rat, and both captor and captive were promptly covered with\r\na glass shade to be watched. With an instinct to escape stronger than\r\nhunger, _Ptyas_ relinquished his hold, and manifested uneasiness. Then\r\nthe glass shade was raised a trifle, and instantly away ran the rat;\r\nbut the snake was after it like a flash, caught it, and glided away\r\nswiftly, with head erect and the rat in its mouth.\r\n\r\nAt one of the Davis lectures at the Zoological Gardens, a fine Rat\r\nsnake in the Society’s collection was exhibited, and was permitted to\r\nbe handled by a favoured few. To hold it _still_ was not possible,\r\nfor the creature glided through the hand, and entwined itself about\r\none as if a dozen snakes had you in possession. It was very tame, and\r\naccustomed to be handled by the keeper, whose especial pet it was;\r\notherwise _Ptyas_ is a powerful snake, and quite capable of strangling\r\nyou should it take a fancy to constrict your neck. On another occasion\r\nthis same snake constricted my arm sufficiently to make my fingers\r\nswell; but that was not so much in anger as for safety, because it\r\ndid not like to be fettered in its movements, or to be somewhat\r\nunceremoniously examined. A younger and less tame specimen tried to\r\nbite me, and squeezed my fingers blue by constricting them.\r\n\r\nThere is no circumventing these ‘lithe and elegant beings.’ They will\r\nget into your pocket, or up your sleeve; and while you think you have\r\nthe head safely in your hand, the whole twelve feet of snake will have\r\nglided through, and be making its way to the book shelves, or where you\r\nleast expect to see it.\r\n\r\nWhen frequently handling the young constrictors, one has been able\r\nto _feel_ as well as to observe the action of the ribs. As they pass\r\nthrough the hand, you feel them expanded, so as to present a flatter\r\nunder surface. In _Ptyas_ the back is remarkably keeled when crawling,\r\na section of his body presenting the form of the middle diagram given\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSchlegel describes the forms which the bodies of various snakes assume\r\nin swimming, climbing, clinging, etc. Sometimes they are laterally\r\ncompressed, at others flattened. The three figures above are on a much\r\nreduced scale, but give an idea of the sections of three different\r\nsnakes, though each snake is capable of several such changes of form.\r\nWhen snakes climb against the glass of their cages, you may easily\r\ndiscern the flattening of their bodies. In this action there seems to\r\nbe a compressing power, any hold of the scutæ against a polished plane\r\nbeing, of course, impossible; yet without holding they seem to cling;\r\nand the ribs advance in wave-like intervals just the same, with an\r\nintermediate space at rest until in turn the wave is there and passes\r\non, while from an anterior portion another wave approaches, and so on.\r\nYet the _compressure_ strikes one forcibly. There is also the evident\r\nsupport of the tail in a large python thus crawling to the very top of\r\nhis cage.\r\n\r\nMr. Gosse observed the dilatation and flattening of the body in the\r\nclimbing snakes, and that they had no more difficulty in gliding up a\r\ntree or a wall in a straight line than on the ground. In the _Anecdotes\r\nof Serpents_, revised for the Messrs. W. & R. Chambers, of Edinburgh,\r\nin 1875, from the tract by the late John Keast Lord, I also recorded my\r\nobservations on this peculiarity.\r\n\r\nSome young Jamaica boas crawled to the top of their cage as soon as\r\nthey were born. I saw them the same day; _held_ them, as well as it\r\nwas possible to hold threads of quicksilver; _felt_ them, too, for\r\nthe exceedingly juvenile constrictors tied up my fingers cleverly. So\r\ndid some young boa constrictors, born alive at the Gardens, June 30,\r\n1877. They were from fifteen to twenty inches in length, and had teeth\r\nsufficiently developed to draw blood from Holland’s hand, showing fight\r\nand ingratitude at the same time. They were exceedingly active, and fed\r\non young mice, which they constricted instinctively. One of them, known\r\nas ‘Totsey,’ subsequently _hung_ for her portrait, as on p. 201.\r\n\r\nIn vol. xx. of _Nature_, p. 528, is a very clever paper on the\r\nprogression of snakes, by H. F. Hutchinson, who has evidently\r\nobserved them closely. He arrives at the conclusion that they have\r\nthree different modes, viz. ‘on smooth plane surfaces by means of\r\ntheir rib-legs;’ ... ‘through high grass by rapid, almost invisible,\r\nsinuous onward movement, like swimming;’ in climbing straight walls\r\nor ascending smooth surfaces by creating a vacuum with the ventral\r\nscales. He reminds us that cobras, kraits, the rat snake, and other\r\nslender and active kinds are constantly found on house roofs, walls,\r\nstraight smooth trees, etc., and asks how they got there. He has seen\r\nthe ‘abdominal scales creating a vacuum like the pedal scales of house\r\nlizards.’ He put some active little snakes on the ground, where there\r\nwas no hold for the scutæ, and they ‘flew about in all directions.’ He\r\nsaw that they moved on by these quick, sinuous curves—‘rapid wriggles.’\r\n\r\nIn company with my esteemed friend, Mr. Robert Chambers of Edinburgh,\r\nwe made similar experiments by placing some of the smooth-scaled,\r\nactive snakes on a boarded floor. Being extremely wild, they displayed\r\ntheir anger and skill to perfection, and literally _swam_ along,\r\nscarcely touching the floor, and so swiftly that we had difficulty in\r\npursuing and securing them again. Some very young _Tropidonoti_ when\r\ndisturbed flew or ‘swam’ about their cage in the same manner. We also\r\nsaw pythons climb up a window-frame, and a corner of the room where no\r\nvisible hold could be obtained; and after the example of Sir Everard\r\nHome, we allowed the reptiles to crawl over our hands, when we could\r\nfeel the expansion and flattening of the body by the spreading of the\r\nribs. I incline to agree, therefore, with the writer in _Nature_, that\r\nthere is a sort of vacuum created by the ventral scales. Dr. Stradling\r\nobserved that on occasions of retreat, some snakes move in such rapid\r\nand ever-varying sinuations as to baffle you completely when you\r\nattempt to lay hold of them; the part you thought to grasp is gone.[69]\r\nSuch are the movements of _Pituophis_ and of _Echis_ (p. 151).\r\n\r\nAt the risk of being tedious, a few more words must be added on this\r\nsubject of progression, because we so constantly see it asserted that\r\nsnakes ‘move with difficulty over smooth surfaces.’ Their actions have\r\nnot excited sufficient attention and study. Have you ever watched them\r\nmoving about in their bath at the Zoological Gardens? The motions of\r\na python once particularly struck me. The earthenware pan was smooth\r\npolished ware, and with enough water in it to render it smoother, if\r\nthat be possible. The reptile was not swimming, for the thicker part\r\nof its body was not even wholly submersed. The pan was too shallow\r\nfor that, and too small to permit of any portion of the python being\r\nfully extended. It moved in ever-varying coils and curves, yet with\r\nthe greatest ease, its head slightly raised, so that the nostrils and\r\nmouth were out of water. It seemed to be enjoying its bath, as it\r\nactively glided, turned, and curved in that wonderful fashion which\r\nRuskin described as ‘a bit one way, a bit another, and some of him not\r\nat all.’ There could be no hold for the scutæ in this case, nor could\r\nI detect any action of the ribs as in crawling over a less smooth\r\nsurface. The creature seemed to move by its easy sinuations, and with\r\nno more effort than you see in the fish at an aquarium. Perfectly\r\nincomprehensible is this lax and leisurely movement in shallow\r\nwater. Even the inert little slow-worm astonishes us by its physical\r\nachievements, which will be duly described in its especial chapter.\r\n\r\nBut among the most characteristically active are the small and slender\r\ntree snakes, the _Dryadidæ_ and _Dendrophidæ_, mostly of a brilliant\r\ngreen. These and the Whip snakes are exceedingly long and slender,\r\nthe tails of many of them very gradually diminishing to a fine and\r\nattenuated point. Some of them are closely allied to the lizards, and\r\nskim and dash through the foliage with a scarcely perceptible weight.\r\nThese are the true acrobats, full of gracile ease and activity. Many\r\nare over four feet in length, and not much thicker than a pencil.\r\n\r\nThey are found in the hot countries of both hemispheres. The Siamese\r\ncall some of them ‘sunbeams,’ from their combination of grace and\r\nsplendour, and in Brazil some have the brilliant tints of the\r\nhumming-birds. These little creatures in your hand feel like soft,\r\nfine, satin cords endowed with life.\r\n\r\nDr. Wucherer, writing from Brazil, enthusiastically declared that he\r\nwas always delighted to find one of them in his garden. He discovered\r\nthem coiled in a bird’s nest, their body of two feet long occupying a\r\nspace no larger than the hollow of your hand. ‘In an instant they dart\r\nupwards between the branches and over the leaves, which scarcely bend\r\nbeneath their weight. A moment more, and you have lost them.’[70]\r\n\r\nKrefft, of Australia, had some of the active snakes, which were\r\nconfined in an empty room, but one day could not be found. At last they\r\nwere discovered upon the moulding of a door, nine feet from the floor!\r\nThey must have climbed up the smooth wood-work in their own mysterious\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nEre concluding this chapter, one slight exception to the extremely\r\n‘simple’ spinal column must be named. This is that certain families,\r\nmore nearly allied to the lizards, or most far removed from the vipers,\r\nhave rudiments of pelvic bones, or those which in bipeds connect the\r\nlegs with the trunk. In a few families there is even a pair of these\r\nrudiments externally, though only in the form of a spur or claw, as\r\nseen in the boa constrictor, the pythons, and some of the blindworms,\r\nand usually more developed in the male.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, the true skeleton of a claw beneath the skin,\r\ncomposed of several bones, and presenting somewhat the form of a bird’s\r\nclaw, hinting at the common ancestry between snakes and lizards. These\r\nspurs, though mere vestiges of limbs, must still be of some use to the\r\nlarge constrictors when climbing trees and hanging from the branches.\r\nThey are found in the boa, python, eryx, and tortrix, four groups\r\nwhich approach the lizard characteristics; also in _Boa aquatica_, the\r\nanaconda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n_FRESH-WATER SNAKES._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE frequent allusion to water snakes in the preceding chapters seems\r\nto render this a suitable place to describe them more in detail; and\r\namong them are of course the sea snakes, and ‘The Great Sea Serpent’\r\nmust not be omitted.\r\n\r\nIn many books on natural history, particularly if herpetology occupy\r\nany space, we find the subject wound up with a chapter on ‘The Sea\r\nSerpent,’ forming a sort of apologetic little addendum, as if the\r\ncreature of questionable existence must claim no space in the heart of\r\nthe volume, yet is not quite so unimportant as to be omitted altogether.\r\n\r\nOn the part of some other authors, a total and summary dismissal of the\r\n‘monster’ is apt to exclude with it any reference to the smaller sea\r\nsnakes, whose actual existence is therefore a fact less known than it\r\nshould be; and many persons, seeing the doubt cast upon the celebrated\r\nindividual whose reputed reappearance on the prorogation of Parliament\r\nhas become an annual joke, conclude that all sea snakes are similarly\r\nmythical.\r\n\r\nAdmitting it to be a dubious creature, with neither name nor\r\nancestry in ophidian annals, I must not give it precedence of the\r\nrecognised water snakes; but it shall figure in the heart of my book\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\n‘_Fresh-water snakes_’ form the fourth, and ‘_Sea snakes_’ the fifth\r\nof the five groups into which Dr. Günther has separated the ophidian\r\nfamilies; but the gradations between the land and the fresh-water\r\nspecies, and between the latter and the salt-water snakes or the true\r\n_Hydrophidæ_, are, like all other herpetological features, extremely\r\nclose. There are water-loving land snakes and land-frequenting water\r\nsnakes, that is, those which are equally at home in both. In the\r\ntrue water species, however, we find modifications of ordinary rules\r\nwhich show them to be peculiarly protected and adapted for an aquatic\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nOne notable characteristic in all, both salt-water and fresh, is the\r\nposition of the nostrils on the top of the snout, and in many these are\r\nprotected by a valve which closes at will. As air-breathing animals\r\nthey must come to the surface, but the timid, stealthy ophidian\r\ninstinct which seeks to hide from observation can be indulged even\r\nin the water, with the nostrils so situated that only a very small\r\nsurface of the head need be exposed. Could we examine the interior\r\nof the mouth we should doubtless find some slight variation in the\r\nposition of the glottis also. In a foregoing chapter we saw that the\r\ntrachea opens exactly opposite to and close behind what Dumeril calls\r\nthe ‘arrière-narines;’ ‘leur glotte qui est à deux lèvres et qui\r\nrepresente un larynx très simple, s’ouvre dans la bouche derrière\r\nle fourreau de la langue ... elle s’élève pour se presenter dilatée\r\nsous les arrière-narines.’[71] The glottis of water snakes must have a\r\nstill more upward direction to present itself to those air passages.\r\nPerhaps water snakes do not require to yawn so frequently as is the\r\nhabit of their terrestrial relatives; and if they do, it must be a rare\r\nprivilege to be able to inspect the process, as one can so frequently\r\ndo with the pythons and vipers at home. Our authorities do not give us\r\nmuch information on this point.[72]\r\n\r\nTheir moderately long tapering tail is used as a propelling power.\r\nExteriorly, too, water snakes have smooth non-imbricated scales, though\r\nexceptions exist in those species which frequent both land and water,\r\nas the _Tropidonoti_, a large family of which our common English ring\r\nsnake is a member, and which, as their name denotes, have all keeled\r\nscales, from τρόπις, τρόπιδος, _a keel_. These, also, can elevate\r\ntheir ribs, and so flatten the body in the water, another assistant in\r\nswimming.\r\n\r\nA marked exception to the smooth-scaled, water-loving snakes is the\r\nAfrican viper, known as the ‘River Jack’ from its partiality to water.\r\n_Vipera rhinosceros_, from the spinous scales which have the appearance\r\nof horns on its nose, is allied to those described in the 18th chapter.\r\nThough not strictly a water snake, it much frequents it, and glides\r\nthrough it with ease, the more remarkable because, in common with those\r\nother ‘horned vipers’ of Africa, it has a short, insignificant little\r\ntail, which can be of little use as a propelling power. Altogether,\r\nit is one of the ugliest and most ferocious-looking of the whole\r\nserpent tribe, with a thick, heavy body, a dingy, rough exterior, and\r\nstrongly-carinated scales. Excepting in colour, and a more horizontal\r\ninclination of its horns, it is not unlike the _V. nasicornis_ of the\r\ncoloured illustration, chap. xviii.\r\n\r\nWhile all the _Homalopsidæ_ or true fresh-water snakes are innocent,\r\nthere are many other venomous kinds known as ‘water serpents,’ both\r\nin Africa and America. For example, the ‘water viper,’ or ‘water\r\nmoccasin,’ _Cenchris piscivorus_, whose aquatic and fish-eating\r\npropensities were described in the chapter on Tails. This ‘thorn-tail’\r\nviper has not, however, the nostrils of the true fresh-water snakes or\r\n_Homalopsidæ_. In Australia also are several poisonous species, known\r\nvernacularly as ‘water snakes;’ but strictly speaking, and on the\r\nauthority of Günther, the true _Homalopsidæ_ are all non-venomous.\r\n\r\nTo describe these more minutely from Günther, Krefft, and Dr. E.\r\nNicholson, ‘they have a body moderately cylindrical, a tail somewhat\r\ncompressed at the root, and more or less prehensile. Many of them have\r\na distinctly prehensile tail, by which they hold on to projecting\r\nobjects;’ and in times of storms and strong currents we can imagine\r\nthe importance of this security to them. Their eyes, though prominent,\r\nare small, and thus less exposed to injury; and the nostrils, as\r\nalready stated, are on the upper surface of the head, and provided\r\nwith a valvule. Another peculiarity is that the last or back tooth of\r\nthe maxillary bone is a grooved fang, a transitional tooth between an\r\nordinary one and a fang; but there is no evidence of any poisonous\r\nsaliva connected with it. Indeed, as we may repeat, Dr. Günther\r\ndistinctly affirms that all the fresh-water snakes are harmless and\r\n_thoroughly aquatic_, though a few are occasionally found on the\r\nbeach. They inhabit rivers and estuaries, feeding on fish, and rarely\r\ncoming to land; some of them frequent brackish waters, and even enter\r\nthe sea. These latter in their organization approach the true marine\r\nserpents. One Indian example, _Hydrinus_, is semi-pelagic. They are all\r\nviviparous, producing their young in the water; and they belong to the\r\ntropical or semi-tropical regions. In Australia they are found only\r\nin the far north; but in America some so-called ‘water snakes,’ which\r\nspend most of their time in the water, frequent rivers which are frozen\r\nover in winter, during which season they probably undergo hibernation\r\nin holes near the banks.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the older naturalists describe ‘water snakes’ in words which\r\nleave us no doubt as to the _numbers_, though of their name we cannot\r\nbe so certain. Carver in 1796 mentioned some small islands near the\r\nwestern end of Lake Erie, so infested with snakes that it was dangerous\r\nto land upon them. It is impossible that any place can produce a\r\ngreater number of all kinds of snakes, particularly the ‘water snake,’\r\nthan this. He says: ‘The lake is covered near the banks of the islands\r\nwith the large pond lily, the leaves of which lie on the surface of the\r\nwater so thick as to cover it entirely for many acres together, and\r\non each of these lay wreaths of water snakes, amounting to myriads,\r\nbasking in the sun.’ A sight of the last century this. I have passed\r\nover that part of Lake Erie and through the Detroit river, and remember\r\nthe islands and the water-lilies and other attractive objects, but\r\n‘wreaths of water snakes’ were not of these.\r\n\r\nLawson, too, can assure us of their habitat, but not their name, and\r\nhis account is of worth chiefly to verify their swarming numbers. It is\r\npossible that some of those which he describes are now extinct or very\r\nrare. ‘Of water Snakes there are four sorts. The first is of the Horn\r\nSnake’s Colour, though less.’ (This might be the young of the ‘water\r\nmoccasin,’ _Cenchris_, or _Trigonoceph. piscivorus_.) ‘The next is a\r\nvery long Snake, differing in Colour, and will make nothing to swim\r\nover a River a League wide. They hang upon Birches and other Trees by\r\nthe Water Side. I had the Fortune once to have one of them leap into\r\nmy Boat as I was going up a narrow River. The Boat was full of Mats,\r\nwhich I was glad to take out and so get rid of him. They are reckoned\r\npoisonous. A third is much of an English Adder Colour, but always\r\nfrequents the Salts, and lies under the drift Seaweed, where they are\r\nin Abundance, and are accounted mischievous when they bite. The last\r\nis of a sooty, black Colour, and frequents Ponds and Ditches. What his\r\nQualities are, I cannot tell.’\r\n\r\nCatesby is responsible for having called _Tropidonotus fasciatus_\r\n‘the brown water viper,’ a stumbling-block to many ever since, much\r\nconfusion existing between this and the true ‘water viper,’ the\r\ndangerous moccasin snake. Occasionally they are very dark. They are\r\nrather thick and viperish-looking as well, but are perfectly harmless.\r\n\r\nThis is the snake to which almost this book owes its origin, the\r\nspecimens at the Zoological Gardens called ‘Moccasins’ tripping me up\r\nat the outset, as my preface sets forth. Holbrooke describes it as\r\nspending most of its time in the water, or about pond and river banks.\r\nIt swims rapidly, and hundreds may be seen darting in all directions\r\nthrough the water. They are very common in the United States, and might\r\nhave formed the ‘wreathed myriads’ on Lake Erie formerly. In summer\r\nthey roost on the lower branches of trees, overhanging the water, like\r\n_Trigonocephalus piscivorus_, the true ‘water moccasin,’ or ‘cotton\r\nmouth.’ At the time of writing there are examples of both these at\r\nthe Gardens, the harmless ‘moccasin,’ a rather handsome snake, and\r\nthe venomous one (not there recognised as the well-known moccasin of\r\nthe United States), so nearly black that we can account for its being\r\noccasionally called the ‘black water viper.’\r\n\r\nIt is probably _Tropidonotus_ which Parker Gilmore describes as ‘water\r\nvipers.’[73] At Vincennes in Indiana, he says, ‘On the side where some\r\nalder bushes grow in the water, I have seen, on a very warm and bright\r\nday, such numbers of water vipers twined round the limbs and trunks\r\nwhich margin the pond, that it would be almost impossible to wade a\r\nyard without being within reach of one of them. They certainly have all\r\nthe appearance of being venomous; the inhabitants say, however, they\r\nare harmless. They feed principally on fish, frogs, and small birds.’\r\n\r\nOf American water snakes, the anaconda deserves special mention. Of\r\nit Seba says, ‘Ce serpent habite plus les eaux que les rochers;’ and\r\nin its having the nostrils situated on the top of the head, and in\r\npossessing some other features in common with the _Homalopsidæ_, we\r\nare justified in calling it a water serpent, notwithstanding it is a\r\ntrue constrictor. ‘Mother of waters,’ the aborigines of South America\r\ncall it. It is the _Boa aquatica_ of Neuwied, and _Eunectes murinus_\r\nof Wagler, the latter name being the one most frequently used by\r\nmodern herpetologists. Dumeril adopts it, _l’Eunect murin_, giving the\r\norigin of the generic name, _bon nageur_, from the Greek εὐ, _bien_,\r\n_fort_, and νηϰτής, _nageur_—_qui nage bien_. As to the meaning of the\r\nspecific name _murinus_, there can be but little doubt, though some\r\nhave attributed it to its mouse-coloured skin or spots. _Le mangeur de\r\nrats_, Bonnat called it; _le rativoro_, Lacepède. Seba, who was one of\r\nthe first to describe it, says, ‘Il font guerre aux rats;’ and Bonnat,\r\non his authority, says, ‘Il se nourrit d’une espèce de rats.’ ‘Serpent\r\nd’Amerique à moucheteur de tortue,’ Seba also describes it, and with\r\n‘jolies écailles magnifiquement madrées de grandes taches, semblable de\r\ncelles des tortues; taches semées sans ordres, grands, petits,’ etc.\r\n_Murinus_, therefore, clearly refers to its food, not its colour.\r\n\r\nDumeril’s description is of more scientific exactness: ‘Pas de\r\nfossettes aux lèvres. On peut aisément reconnaitre les Eunectes seul\r\nentre les boa, ils ont les narines percées à la face supérieure du bout\r\ndu museau et directement tournées vers le ciel.’ These, being extremely\r\nsmall, and with a power to close hermetically, declare its aquatic\r\nhabits. Its eyes are prominent, and so placed that the reptile can see\r\nbefore it, and also below—that is, down into the waters.\r\n\r\nOn first sight it might be a matter of wonder that so large a serpent\r\nshould condescend to a meal of rats and mice; but to explain this we\r\nmust again go back to the early naturalists, when we discover that what\r\nSeba called _le rat d’Amerique_ was a rodent quite worth constricting\r\nfor dinner. Under the order _Muridæ_ were included in those days a\r\nnumber of the larger rodents, such as the Paca, _Mus Braziliensis_; the\r\nCoypu, _Mus coypus_; _Myopotamus_, the Capybara; the Murine opossum,\r\nand several others, aquatic in their habits, and large enough to\r\nattract the ‘Giant of the Waters.’\r\n\r\nFrom the vernacular _Matatoro_, or ‘Bull killer,’ also a whole century\r\nof misrepresentations have arisen, the said ‘bull’ being really as\r\nsmall in proportion as the ‘rats’ and ‘mice’ were large. ‘The deer\r\nswallower’ is another of its local titles, showing that it is a serpent\r\nof varying tastes. Stories are told of this ‘monster’ killing itself\r\nin attempting to gorge large animals with enormously extended horns,\r\nanimals not to be found among the Brazilian fauna; and familiar to\r\nmost persons are the illustrations of anacondas of untraceable length,\r\nthe posterior portion coiled round a branch fifty feet high, and the\r\nanterior coiled round a bull as big as a prize ox. These illustrations\r\nare the offspring of ignorance rather than reality, and though\r\noccasionally _Eunectes_ might come to grief by attacking a somewhat\r\nunmanageable meal, yet its recognised specific, _murinus_ or _murina_,\r\npoints more clearly the true nature of its food, viz. rodents of at\r\nmost some two feet long.\r\n\r\nNo less exaggerated than its appetite is its length. Possibly anacondas\r\nmay have attained greater size formerly when there were fewer enemies\r\nthan at present, if it be true, as some have affirmed, that serpents\r\ngrow all their lives. Thirty feet is the utmost length on record.\r\nWallace affirms that he has never seen one exceeding twenty feet. Those\r\nindividuals at the Zoological Gardens have rarely exceeded this, and\r\nGünther gives twenty-two feet as their average length in the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nOf those known in South Africa as ‘water snakes,’ one is _Avusamans_\r\nvernacularly, a black one and common, and another, _Iffulu_, of a\r\nbeautiful bright green. Mr. Woodward, whose scientific egg-sucker\r\nhas been already mentioned in chap. iii., states that both these are\r\npoisonous, that he never saw the green one out of water, and that\r\nit is unsafe to bathe where they are. On referring to Dr. Andrew\r\nSmith’s _Zoology of South Africa_, I am not able to identify these\r\nwith certainty, and do not, therefore, give the above as scientific\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nBut before concluding this part of the subject, I would add a word or\r\ntwo on the importance of an accurate description of the snake, as far\r\nas possible, when one is found in some unusual situation; because a\r\nsnake being found in the water is no proof that it is a water snake, or\r\neven that it was there by choice. Livingstone, in his _Expedition to\r\nthe Zambesi_, p. 150, describes the number of venomous creatures, such\r\nas scorpions, centipedes, etc., that were found on board, ‘having been\r\nbrought into the ship with wood.’ ‘Snakes also came sometimes with the\r\nwood, but oftener floated down the river to us, climbing easily by the\r\nchain cable. Some poisonous ones were caught in the cabin. A green one\r\nwas there several weeks, hiding in the daytime.’\r\n\r\nOften in newspapers are stories of ‘sea snakes’ as having appeared\r\nquite out of their geographical range. These on investigation may\r\nreasonably be traced to land snakes which have been carried out by the\r\ntidal rivers. In _Land and Water_ of Jan. 5, 1878, was such a story.\r\nAgain, March 31, the following year, a correspondent, ‘J. J. A.,’ on\r\n‘Animal Life in New Caledonia,’ stated that the sea inside the reefs\r\nis sometimes covered with both dead and living creatures carried out\r\nby the violence of the currents after heavy rains. ‘The flooded rivers\r\nrush with great force from the mountains,’ and numbers of reptiles were\r\namong the victims of that force. He saw ‘incredible numbers of snakes,’\r\nand described the common sea snakes as ‘stupid, fearless things, that\r\nwill not get out of your way.... The small sand-islands are literally\r\nalive with them.’ The writer made no pretensions to be a naturalist, or\r\nto state confidently what the snakes were specifically. New Caledonia\r\nwould seem to be rather beyond the range of sea snakes proper, and\r\nthose ‘incredible numbers’ may have been only land snakes involuntarily\r\ntaking a sea bath, or certain species frequenting brackish waters, like\r\nthose in South Carolina described by Lawson.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time an American newspaper contained an account given\r\nby Captain O. A. Pitfield, of the steamship _Mexico_, who stated that\r\nhe had ‘passed through a tangled mass of snakes’ off the Tortuga\r\nislands, at the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico. The ship was ‘more\r\nthan an hour’ in passing them. ‘They were of all sizes, from the\r\nordinary green water snake of two feet long, to monsters, genuine “sea\r\nserpents,” of fourteen to fifteen feet in length.’ I replied to both\r\nthese communications at the time (_Land and Water_, April 5, 1879),\r\ninviting further information, and describing the features by which\r\ntrue water and true sea snakes could be easily distinguished. Nothing\r\nfurther appeared on the subject, and I have little doubt but that, in\r\nboth cases, the ‘shoals of sea snakes’ were land species that had been\r\nmerely carried out to sea by force of rivers. I have since been more\r\nstrongly inclined to this opinion on learning from Dr. Stradling that\r\nsimilar transportations of snakes occur through the force of some of\r\nthe South American rivers. ‘Do you know the snakes which belong to the\r\nRiver Plate proper?’ he asks me by letter. ‘So many are brought down by\r\nfloods from Paraguay—even the big constrictors—that it is difficult\r\nto determine from occasional specimens.’\r\n\r\nI could not, unfortunately, refer to any books that afforded much\r\ninformation on this subject; for amongst the greatest literary needs\r\nexperienced by an ophiologist is some complete and special work on\r\nthe South American snakes, corresponding with Günther’s _Reptiles of\r\nBritish India_, and Krefft’s _Snakes of Australia_.\r\n\r\nOther writers have mentioned the occurrence of boa constrictors and\r\nanacondas far out at sea occasionally, beguiling the unsophisticated\r\ninto reporting a veritable ‘sea serpent’ to the _Times_ by the first\r\nhomeward-bound mail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n_THE PELAGIC OR SEA SNAKES._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE modifications of ordinary forms which are seen in the fresh-water\r\nsnakes are still more beautifully developed in the _Hydrophidæ_, or\r\ntrue marine serpents. The former, being never out of easy reach of\r\nshore, could easily find a safe harbour from violent torrents, in holes\r\nin the banks or among the strong aquatic weeds along the borders of\r\nlakes and rivers; and to be enabled to hold on to these in times of\r\ndanger or of repose, they possess a prehensile power of tail. In a\r\nrough and stormy ocean, a much more powerful propeller and rudder would\r\nbe necessary for the guidance of the reptile, and to afford resistance\r\nagainst the denser medium of sea water; therefore the tail of sea\r\nsnakes is not only prehensile but strongly compressed, so as to almost\r\nform a vertical fin, answering altogether to that of a fish. This is\r\ntheir most conspicuous and striking feature, and one that would leave\r\nno doubt in the mind of the observer between the true marine and those\r\nfresh-water species which may by accident drift out to sea by force of\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nAnother distinguishing feature is the absence of ventral scales in\r\nmost of the species. In land snakes we saw how admirably adapted are\r\nthe broad, ventral plates for assisting those reptiles over rough\r\nsurfaces, as affording hold; but the _Hydrophidæ_ requiring no such aid\r\nin a fluid, those scutæ would be useless; they are therefore, excepting\r\nin one or two species, entirely absent, or but slightly developed, and\r\nthe belly is ridged instead, like the keel of a boat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of the under side of a sea snake, above and\r\nbelow the anus, with no distinction in tail scales.]\r\n\r\nThe nostrils are small, placed horizontally on the top of the snout,\r\nas in the _Homalopsidæ_, and in most of the sea snakes they are\r\ncontiguous. They are, moreover, furnished with a valve, which is under\r\ncontrol of the will, opening to admit air, and closing to exclude water\r\nwhen diving. For, be it remembered, these marine reptiles breathe\r\nthrough their nostrils even more entirely than terrestrial snakes, the\r\nlatter being better able to indulge their yawning propensities, or to\r\noccasionally respire slightly, and through parted lips and the tongue\r\nchink as well. Sea snakes, on the contrary, not requiring the continual\r\nuse of their tongue to feel and explore surroundings, and not using\r\nit below water, are not provided with the little centre chink for its\r\nexsertion; but the middle plate of the upper lip, _i.e._ the ‘rostral\r\nshield’ (see illus. p. 238), is altogether of a different form. Indeed,\r\nthe centre plates or shields in both lips are conspicuously modified,\r\nthe upper one often inclining downwards in a point which fits into the\r\nlower one shaped to receive it, so that the mouth is firmly closed\r\nto keep out the water. Less required, the tongue is shorter and less\r\ndeveloped, the tips are less hair-like, as only these, if at all,\r\nare exposed to the sea water, and a very small notch on each side of\r\nthe pointed rostral shield of some permits the slight egress of these\r\ntips. When out of their natural element, the tongue is brought into\r\nmore active service, for then the bewildered reptiles require its\r\nassistance, and it is then seen to be exserted as in land snakes. Their\r\nlungs extend the whole length of the body to the anus, and by retaining\r\na large supply of air, these animals are enabled to float easily, as\r\nthey do for a long while on the surface of the calm tropical seas, not\r\nonly while sleeping, as mentioned in the chapter on hibernation, but in\r\npure enjoyment, and probably in the lazy _postprandial_ condition.\r\n\r\nAs has been already stated, the eyes of sea snakes are adapted to\r\nsee better through the medium of water than through the brilliant\r\natmosphere of their native latitudes. They are very small, and soon\r\nblinded by light; consequently, though among the swiftest and most\r\ngracile of serpents in their native element, the movements of the\r\n_Hydrophidæ_ on land are uncertain and ‘maladroit.’\r\n\r\nSome forty years ago, Dr. Theodore Cantor, F.Z.S., devoted a good deal\r\nof time to the study of the pelagic serpents, and wrote a somewhat\r\ndetailed account of them to the Zoological Society. His paper,\r\npublished in the _Zoological Society Transactions_, 1842, vol. ii., was\r\nconsidered the most important that had as yet appeared. He, therefore,\r\nhas been one of our first authorities. Subsequently we are indebted to\r\nGünther, Dr. E. Nicholson, Gerard Krefft, and Sir Joseph Fayrer for the\r\nresults of their individual observations. In my foregoing descriptions\r\nI have culled from each of these, and as most modern writers on this\r\nsubject merely reproduce from the works of Günther, Cantor, and Fayrer,\r\nI will keep chiefly to these in what further has to be said of sea\r\nsnakes.\r\n\r\nFirst, they belong to the tropical seas of the Eastern hemisphere,\r\nand are most numerous in the Indian Ocean, where they abound. The\r\ngeographical range of a few is, however, somewhat extensive, viz. from\r\nMadagascar and that part of the African coast to northern Australia,\r\nthe Bay of Bengal, and even to the western coasts of Panama; while\r\nothers are restricted to certain localities. All are highly venomous.\r\nThey are wild and ferocious as well, and therefore peculiarly\r\ndangerous, and are the great dread of fishermen, who carefully avoid\r\nthem. Accidents, nevertheless, frequently happen through their being\r\ncaught in the nets, when, from their exceeding activity, it is\r\ndifficult to disengage them and set them free again. When out of the\r\nwater they try to bite at the nearest objects, and being dazzled by the\r\nlight, strike wildly, unable to aim correctly. Cantor informs us that\r\nhe has known them to turn and strike their own bodies in their rage,\r\nand that he has found difficulty in disengaging their fangs and teeth\r\nfrom their own flesh.\r\n\r\nOwing to the great danger attending their capture, and also the almost\r\nimpossibility of keeping them alive when out of the sea, less is\r\naccurately known of the pelagic than most other snakes. Even if placed\r\nin a large hole in the ground filled with sea water, or a capacious\r\ntank similarly supplied, they die very rapidly. Sir Joseph Fayrer\r\nin his experiments resorted to every means in order to keep them\r\nalive, but informs us that their exceeding delicacy caused their rapid\r\ndeath in spite of the utmost care. Dr. Vincent Richards, however, has\r\nsucceeded in keeping some alive several weeks.\r\n\r\nIn length they vary from two to ten feet. Krefft says that the largest\r\nhe ever saw was nine feet long. Günther states that they sometimes\r\nattain twelve feet, and sea snakes of even fourteen feet in length have\r\nbeen occasionally reported, though not perhaps from well authenticated\r\nsources. It is probable that, like all other reptiles, they attain\r\ntheir greatest proportions in the hottest regions.\r\n\r\nThough purely oceanic, and no more found in fresh water than on dry\r\nground, yet they come some distance up the rivers as far as brackish\r\nwater. When washed on shore by the surf, they are helpless and blind,\r\nand at such times ‘peaceable,’ by reason of their helplessness.\r\nOccasionally they are seen coiled up asleep on the beach, where they\r\nhave probably been washed by the tide, and where the next tide will no\r\ndoubt release them from their uncongenial bed. Those species which have\r\na less keeled body and the partially developed ventral scales might\r\neven manage to get back to sea independently of the tide. Even those\r\nwithout ventral scales contrive to wriggle along in their own fashion.\r\n\r\nSuch an occurrence is related by Mr. E. H. Pringle in the _Field_\r\nnewspaper of 3d September 1881. He tracked an _Enhydrina_ fifty feet\r\nalong the sands, making its way back to the sea from a salt-water pool,\r\nwhere it had probably been left by the tide. This species is the one\r\npeculiarly favoured in having tiny orifices for the egress of the\r\ntongue tips on each side of its lobulated snout.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Enhydrina._ From Fayrer’s _Thanatophidia_.]\r\n\r\nIts profile, being somewhat remarkable, is here presented to the\r\nreader, who will perhaps detect a certain determination in that very\r\nbeak-like snout. This species is found along the Burman coast. Another,\r\nthough keeping to its native element, has explored the Pacific to the\r\nvery borders of America, and has been seen on the western coast of\r\nPanama. This is _Pelamis bicolor_, of distinct black and yellow, like\r\na striped satin ribbon. The back is black, and the belly brown or\r\nyellowish, and its rather short, flat tail is spotted with a bluish\r\ncolour as well. None of his relatives venture so far from the oriental\r\nislands as _Pelamis_. His presence as far north as New Caledonia has\r\nnot, that I am aware of, been authoritatively recorded; we cannot\r\nsuggest, therefore, the probability of ‘J. J. A.’s’ sea snakes, ‘stupid\r\nand fearless,’ being ‘incredible numbers’ of the _Pelamis_ family. Dr.\r\nStradling affirms that they are ‘not unfrequently met with along the\r\neastern coast of South America, and that one found its way on board the\r\nroyal mail steamship _Douro_, and concealed itself under the covering\r\nof the patent lead, having probably climbed up the quarter line as she\r\nlay made fast to the wharf at Santos.’[74]\r\n\r\nSome slight controversy on the possibility of _Pelamis_ ‘climbing’\r\nfollowed this statement. But Mr. F. Buckland also recorded one ‘which\r\ncrawled up the anchor-chain of a man-of-war, when she was moored in\r\nthe mouth of the Ganges. The midshipman of the watch saw something\r\nmoving along the chain, and without thinking went to pick it up, when\r\nit turned upon him, and bit him. The poor young midshipman did not live\r\nmany hours after the accident’ (_Land and Water_, Nov. 15, 1879).\r\n\r\nIn the same issue the writer described one which was caught in the\r\ntelegraph wire of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. One of the\r\ncables was being raised, and when it came to the surface, the snake\r\nwas found coiled tightly round it. _Hydrophis_ was here exercising his\r\nprehensile powers, not understanding the reason of the violent motion.\r\nSnakes, as has been already affirmed, are not restricted in their\r\nacrobatic achievements; so that even sea snakes, not naturally either\r\nclimbers or crawlers, can do both on an occasion.\r\n\r\nThe more interesting question regarding Dr. Stradling’s cable climber\r\nis, was it a true _Pelamis_, or one of the _Hydrophidæ_ at all? If so,\r\nit was more likely to be an entirely distinct species from those of the\r\noriental seas. Either Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope would be far\r\ntoo southward for their range, they being essentially tropical. When\r\nPanama comes to be severed by water communication, some enterprising\r\n_Pelamis_ or _Enhydrina_ may find its way through, and get down even to\r\nSantos; but at present, as Dr. Stradling did not _see_ the snake, but\r\nonly _heard_ of it, the evidence of the presence of _Hydrophidæ_ on the\r\neastern coast of South America cannot be fully established.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Natural size.\r\n\r\nSame magnified.\r\n\r\nSea snakes’ scales. From the _Thanatophidia_.]\r\n\r\nA further facility to their agile and graceful movements in the water\r\nare their smooth, non-imbricated, or only slightly imbricated scales.\r\nThese, though mostly hexagonal, and laid side by side, different from\r\nthose of land snakes, yet vary much in size and form; and the head\r\nshields particularly are so abnormal, that, as Günther affirms, you can\r\ntell a sea snake at once by them (see illustrations, chap. xviii.).\r\n\r\nTo distinguish a pelagic from a fresh-water snake is, however, far\r\neasier than to distinguish species among themselves. They present great\r\nvarieties of form and colour, but the transitions are very gradual,\r\nand the female is generally larger than the male, and sometimes of a\r\ndifferent colour, which adds to the difficulty.\r\n\r\nThey are all viviparous, and produce their young in the water, where\r\nthe little ones are at once able to take care of themselves, and feed\r\non small fish or molluscs. The full-grown _Hydrophidæ_ feed on fish\r\ncorresponding with their own dimensions, and swallowed head foremost.\r\nEven spiny fish are managed by them, notwithstanding that they have a\r\nsmaller jaw than most land snakes. Being killed by the poison of the\r\nbite on being caught, Günther explains, the muscles of the fish are\r\nrelaxed, and the prey being commenced at the head, the armature does\r\nnot interfere, but folds back flat as the fish is gradually drawn into\r\nthe jaws.\r\n\r\nAn interesting study to the lover of nature it is to watch the\r\nwonderful movements of these sea reptiles. Swimming and diving with\r\nequal facility, flashing into sight and disappearing again in twos or\r\nscores, or in large shoals, pursuing fish, many of them of bright\r\ncolouring, they offer constant amusement to the beholder. Sometimes,\r\nwhen the sailors are throwing their nets, they disappear beneath the\r\nwaves, and are no longer seen for half an hour or more; when presently,\r\nfar away from the spot where they vanished so suddenly, up they come to\r\nthe surface again, to sport once more, or take in a fresh supply of air.\r\n\r\nPity they possess such evil qualities to blind us to their beauties,\r\nfor they rank among the most venomous of serpents. They belong to the\r\nsub-order of venomous colubrine snakes, or _Ophidia colubriformes\r\nVenenosi_, those which outwardly have the aspect of harmless snakes,\r\nwhile yet furnished with poison fangs. In the chapter on Dentition,\r\nthese distinctions, facilitated by the illustrations, are more fully\r\nexplained; here it need only be said that though they have smaller\r\njaws and shorter fangs than many other venomous snakes of their size,\r\nthe virus is plentiful, and so active that the danger from the bite is\r\ngreat. All the pelagic serpents have also a few simple teeth behind\r\nthe fangs; therefore, as Fayrer warns the natives, it does not do to\r\ntrust to the _appearance_ of the wound, which, though looking like the\r\nbite of a harmless snake, would demand immediate remedies. A certain\r\nconviction of danger is that the bite being inflicted in salt water,\r\nwould leave no doubt as to the nature of the snake. Even a painless\r\nwound it is not safe to trust; and Sir Joseph Fayrer gives several such\r\nwarnings among his cases of bite from sea snakes, two of which I will\r\nquote.\r\n\r\nCaptain S——, while bathing in a tidal river, felt what he thought was\r\nthe pinch of a crab on his leg, but took no notice of it, and after\r\nhis bath called on some friends, being to all appearance exceedingly\r\nwell. He remained about an hour, playing the concertina to amuse the\r\nchildren, and declaring himself never in better health. In about two\r\nhours, feeling strange symptoms of suffocation, enlargement of the\r\ntongue, and a rigidity of muscles, he sent for a doctor, but still\r\nhaving no suspicion of danger. The next morning a native detected\r\nthe peculiar symptoms which usually follow the bite of a sea snake;\r\nand Captain S——, then examining the foot which the supposed crab\r\nhad nipped, found marks of fangs no bigger than mosquito bites on\r\nthe tendon Achilles near the ankle. Immediate steps were taken, and\r\nremedies applied which seemed to promise favourable results for a time;\r\nbut in the evening of the third day the victim was seized with spasms,\r\nand died, seventy-one hours after the accident. In this case, owing to\r\nthe sound health of the captain, and no local pain ensuing to warn him,\r\ntogether with the stimulants and remedies applied, and the bite being\r\nwhere absorption was slow, his death was protracted; otherwise death\r\noften occurs within twenty-four hours from that species of snake.[75]\r\n\r\nThe second case was that of a man who was bitten in the finger by a sea\r\nsnake, and thinking lightly of it, used no means whatever to arrest the\r\npoison, and was dead in four hours.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the victim becomes quickly insensible, when, if no aid is\r\nnear, he never wakes to consciousness. Immediate stimulants revive the\r\npatient, and if he can be kept awake, these, with local applications,\r\n_at once applied_, may save his life. ‘Hope itself is a powerful\r\nstimulant,’ adds the learned experimentalist.\r\n\r\nMany other cases are given by Fayrer of bites by sea snakes, some of\r\nwhich yielded to remedies and others were fatal; but for these the\r\nreader is referred to the _Thanatophidia_.\r\n\r\nDr. Cantor had previously made many experiments on various dumb\r\ncreatures in order to ascertain the virulence of the poison of these\r\nhitherto unstudied reptiles. He found that a fowl died in violent\r\nspasms eight minutes after a bite; and a second fowl, bitten directly\r\nafterwards by the same snake, with its half-exhausted venom, in ten\r\nminutes. Fish died in ten minutes; a tortoise in twenty-eight minutes,\r\nfrom the bite of another species; and a harmless snake was paralyzed\r\nwithin half an hour.\r\n\r\nAmong the fresh-water snakes, Dr. Günther tells us of one, _Hydrinus_,\r\nwhich is semi-pelagic, and which indulges in little excursions down the\r\nrivers to exchange greetings with his marine relatives, some of whom,\r\non their part, occasionally go a certain distance up the rivers. Again,\r\namong the sea snakes is one who rambles for change of air or diversity\r\nof diet over the fields and far away. In him, Dr. Günther describes one\r\nof those many transitions found in every class and order throughout\r\nnature. _Platurus_ is his name; he has the ventral scales of land\r\nsnakes to enable him to wander over the salt water marshes which he\r\nloves. His nostrils are on the side of his head instead of on the top,\r\nand his head shields differ from those of all his relatives. His venom\r\nfangs are small, and his tail is not prehensile, presenting the united\r\ncharacters of fresh and salt water and land snakes. Thus we have links\r\nbetween sea and land snakes, between fresh water and salt, and between\r\nthese latter and fishes, for in many instances the affinities are so\r\nclose that naturalists have doubted in which class to place them.\r\nWhen that remarkable animal, the _Lepidosiren_, which Darwin calls a\r\nliving fossil, was first brought from Africa some thirty years ago,\r\nit was found to present so many characteristics in common with both\r\nreptiles and fishes, that it was for some time a mooted question in\r\nwhich class to place it. In appearance it more resembles the former,\r\nwith its four curious filamentary limbs, which Owen considers ‘the\r\nbeginnings of organs which attain full functional development in the\r\nhigher vertebrates.’ The same high authority has decided that the\r\nonly character which absolutely distinguishes fishes from reptiles,\r\nso closely are some of them allied, is whether or not there is an\r\nopen passage from the nostrils to the mouth; and the ‘Lepidosiren’ is\r\nnow known as ‘the mud-fish of the Gambia,’ the ichthyic characters\r\npredominating.\r\n\r\nSea snakes were not unknown to the ancients. Aristotle mentions\r\nthem (Taylor’s Translation, 1812, Book ii. vol. 6), ‘Of sanguineous\r\nanimals, however, there remains the genus of serpents. But they partake\r\nof the nature both of terrestrial and aquatic animals. For most of\r\nthem are terrestrial, and not a few are aquatic, and which live in\r\npotable water. There are also marine serpents similar in form to the\r\nterrestrial genus, except that their head more resembles that of a\r\nconger. There are, however, many genera of marine serpents, and they\r\nare an all-various colour; but they are not generated in very deep\r\nplaces.’\r\n\r\nThese latter words suggest what has not been mentioned as a positive\r\nfact, while yet in part it is corroborated by Cantor, who tells us\r\nthat the young sea snakes feed on soft-shelled molluscs; we may argue,\r\ntherefore, that the mother snakes come into shallow water to give\r\nbirth to their young, where small fish and suitable food may abound.\r\nAristotle was evidently aware of the distinctions between fresh and\r\nsalt water snakes, and gives us the former as frequenting rivers\r\n(‘potable waters’).\r\n\r\nThe Greek mariners who frequented the tropical seas knew of the\r\npoisonous snakes with wholesome dread. Sir Emerson Tennant tells us\r\nthat the fishermen on the west coast of Ceylon are still in perpetual\r\nfear of them. They say there are some with the head hooded like the\r\ncobra, that coil themselves up like serpents on land, not only biting\r\nwith their teeth, but ‘crushing their prey in their coils.’\r\n\r\nThe ‘hood’ part of the story is not borne out by any scientific writer;\r\nand as for the ‘crushing in coils,’ the sailors may possibly mistake\r\nthe prehensile actions of holding on—even to a large fish—possibly\r\nfor the action of crushing in the way of constricting. In\r\nself-protection, or for safety, venomous serpents do entwine themselves\r\npretty tightly round an object sometimes. An instance of this was just\r\nnow given. But constricting for the purpose of killing is happily\r\nconfined to the non-venomous families. It would indeed be terrible if\r\nthe ‘giants of the waters’ could both constrict and bite with poison\r\nfang; and of this a word or two will be said in the following chapter.\r\nAdmittedly but little has been accurately ascertained about the marine\r\nserpents in comparison with the terrestrial ones. And there really\r\nmay be species hitherto unobserved. The great sea serpent question is\r\nnot yet satisfactorily settled; and among the lesser kind, the true\r\npelagians, varieties are frequently occurring. Krefft describes one in\r\nthe Australian Museum which, not being like any other that he had seen,\r\nhe sets down as a new type. Forty-eight distinct species were described\r\nby Cantor. The whole family comprises seven genera, four of which\r\nbelong to the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n‘_THE GREAT SEA SERPENT._’\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE question of varieties and of constriction brings us to ‘The Great\r\nSea Serpent;’ for, putting all the evidence together, if the creature\r\nexist at all he must be a constrictor.\r\n\r\nI do not intend to trouble my readers with the detailed history of this\r\ngreat unknown, for his literature would more than exceed the limits of\r\nthis whole volume. Those who are sufficiently interested in him will\r\nfind ample reading in most of the encyclopedias, which again refer\r\nus to various books in which he has figured from his first supposed\r\nappearance in modern times.\r\n\r\nEver and again, when a new ‘sea monster’ has been reported, the\r\nnewspapers take up the theme, and often give a _resumé_ of its history,\r\nfrom Bishop Pontoppidan’s down to the most recent specimen. References\r\nto the most important of the journalistic authorities usually accompany\r\nthe more detailed accounts; but among them an excellent abridgement of\r\n‘sea serpent’ literature, which appeared in the _Illustrated London\r\nNews_ of October 1848, is worth studying. Another of interest was in\r\nthe _Echo_ of January 15, 1877. In _Silliman’s Journal of Science_,\r\n1835, was also an excellent paper. One of the best digests is that\r\ngiven by P. H. Gosse, in his _Romance of Natural History_, of the ed.\r\n1860. This author, after weighing all the published evidence both from\r\nordinary and scientific sources, and presenting it in a well-arranged\r\nand lucid form, sums up as follows:—\r\n\r\n‘In conclusion, I express my own confident persuasion that there exists\r\nsome oceanic animal of immense proportions, which has not yet been\r\nreceived into the category of scientific zoology; and my strong opinion\r\nthat it possesses close affinities with the fossil _enaliosauria_ of\r\nthe lias.’\r\n\r\nHaving respect for the opinion of so thoughtful a writer, and further\r\nencouraged by the fact that some of our most eminent physiologists have\r\nnot thought it beneath them to give their attention to the various\r\nserpentine appearances which from time to time are seen at sea, and\r\nthat the majority of them believe in the possibility of an unknown\r\nmarine reptile, let us accept this idea as the basis of an endeavour to\r\nlay before my readers another summing up of evidence gathered from the\r\nstill more recent writings on ‘The Great Sea Serpent’ of modern times.\r\n\r\nThose who have honoured this book with attentive perusal thus far,\r\nwill have become initiated in certain ophidian manners, actions, and\r\nappearances which would enable them at once to identify a snake were\r\nthey to have a complete view of one. But to those who are not familiar\r\nwith such peculiarities, and possess only a vague idea of the ophidian\r\nform, many a merely elongated outline at sea may be, and has been,\r\nset down as a ‘serpent,’ which on closer inspection, or by the light\r\nof science, has proved something entirely different. Ribbon-fish,\r\nstrings of porpoises and other cetaceans, long lines of sea-birds on\r\nthe surface of the waves, even logs of drifting wood or bamboo, with\r\nbunches of seaweed doing service as ‘manes’ or ‘fins,’ have in turn,\r\nand by the aid of the imagination, been dubbed ‘the sea serpent’\r\nagain and again. These may be dismissed by the mere mention of a few\r\nsuch as examples. For instance, in _Nature_, vol. xviii., 1878, Dr.\r\nDean describes a reported ‘sea serpent,’ which resolved itself into\r\na flight of birds. E. H. Pringle describes the serpentine appearance\r\nof a bamboo swaying up and down, which at a distance had deceived the\r\nbeholders into the idea of the sea serpent; others explained that long\r\nlines of birds or of sea-weeds had again similarly deceived sailors. In\r\n_Land and Water_, Sept. 22, 1877, we read that the crew of the barque\r\n_Aberfoyle_, off the coast of Scotland, thought they really had got\r\none this time, and approaching the ‘monster,’ lowered and manned a\r\nboat, and seized a harpoon to ‘catch’ the singularly passive creature,\r\nwhich proved to be a mass of ‘a sort of jelly-fish description,’\r\nsome of which they bottled and corked down air-tight; but, alas! it\r\n‘deliquesced’!\r\n\r\nAgain, in _Nature_, Feb. 10, 1881, an imaginary sea serpent seen from\r\nthe _City of Baltimore_ (a ship in which the present writer crossed the\r\nAtlantic, though unfortunately not on that voyage) was pronounced to be\r\na species of whale, the _Zeuglodontia_.\r\n\r\nOne more out of scores of similar reports, which go to show that if\r\nsome unknown marine animal of a longish form is caught, those who\r\nhave anything to do with it immediately label it ‘the sea serpent.’\r\nIn _Land and Water_, Aug. 24, 1878, Mr. Frank Buckland published a\r\ncommunication from an Australian correspondent, regarding a ‘most\r\nremarkable fish,’ of nearly fifteen feet long, and eight inches in\r\ndiameter at the thickest part. It has ‘no scales,’ but ‘a skin like\r\npolished silver,’ is of a tapering form, has a very queer mouth,\r\na ‘mane’ on the neck, and ‘two feelers under the chin, thirty-two\r\ninches long.’ And this unsnake-like thing was taken to the Mechanics’\r\nInstitute of that town, and unhesitatingly. labelled ‘Sea Serpent!’ Dr.\r\nBuckland suggested that it was a ribbon fish.\r\n\r\nThus, we may repeat that it is almost impossible for an unscientific\r\nperson even to _see_, far less to describe, unfamiliar living forms in\r\na manner that would prove sound data for zoologists to decide upon.\r\n\r\nIn a rather detailed communication to _Land and Water_ on this subject,\r\nby Dr. Andrew Wilson, September 15, 1877, he also reminds us how easily\r\nand frequently we may trace supposed resemblances to animals or faces,\r\nwhere none can possibly exist; as, for instance, ‘in the gnarled trunks\r\nand branches of trees.’ Much more true resemblances to serpentine\r\nforms are really seen at sea; as, for example, those ‘floating trunks\r\nand roots of trees serving as a nucleus, around which sea-weed has\r\ncollected.’ In one instance, as Dr. Wilson relates, some such object,\r\nseen from the deck of a yacht, was so deceptive even to intelligent men\r\nwho scrutinized it through the telescope, that the course of the ship\r\nwas changed on purpose to inspect it closely. Dr. Wilson regrets the\r\nunfortunate discredit which has been cast upon all sea-serpent stories\r\nthrough such erroneous observations, causing even the more trustworthy\r\naccounts to be received with almost universal ridicule, and as already\r\nobserved in the opening of chap. xiii., almost to the ignoring of the\r\ntrue sea snakes, which are too often included among the mythical.\r\n\r\nBriefly to enumerate some of those which appear to have recently had\r\nthe chiefest claims to attention as really living creatures, otherwise\r\nthan flights of birds or shoals of fish, but making due allowance for\r\nunscientific observations, and vague or exaggerated representations, we\r\nfind that gigantic marine animals were observed as follows:—\r\n\r\n 1734. Off Greenland.\r\n\r\n 1740. Off Norway; described by Bishop Pontoppidan as 600 feet in\r\n length.\r\n\r\n 1809. Off the Hebrides.\r\n\r\n 1815. Near Boston, U.S.\r\n\r\n 1817. Ditto.\r\n\r\n 1819. Ditto. From 80 to 250 yards in length!\r\n\r\n 1819. One seen for a month off Norway.\r\n\r\n 1822. Ditto; and again 600 feet long.\r\n\r\n 1827. Ditto.\r\n\r\n 1829. Mr. Davidson, surgeon, R.N., described one seen in the Indian\r\n seas as precisely similar to that seen afterwards from the _Dædalus_\r\n in 1848. He wrote of it during the controversy that passed regarding\r\n the latter. Mr. Gosse regarded his testimony as of much value.\r\n\r\n 1833. One seen by five British officers off Halifax, and described by\r\n P. H. Gosse.\r\n\r\n 1837. Again off Norway.\r\n\r\n 1846. Off Norway, and in the same locality as one seen about one\r\n hundred years previously; also during the hottest part of the summer.\r\n This individual had two ‘fins,’ and ‘the movements were like those of\r\n a snake forty to fifty feet long.’\r\n\r\n 1848. The one seen from the _Dædalus_.\r\n\r\n 1850. Off Norway.\r\n\r\n 1851. Ditto.\r\n\r\n 1852. One described by Captain Steele, mentioned by Gosse.\r\n\r\n 1857. One described by Captain Harrison, and considered trustworthy\r\n evidence.\r\n\r\n 1875. One seen from the _Pauline_, July 8, in lat. 5° 30´ S., long.\r\n 35° W. Also on July 13, ‘a similar serpent’ seen from the same barque\r\n _Pauline_.\r\n\r\n 1875. September 11. ‘An enormous marine salamander’ in the Straits of\r\n Malacca, seen from the _Nestor_.\r\n\r\n 1877. Large marine animal seen from the royal yacht _Osborne_ off\r\n Sicily.\r\n\r\n 1879. Colonel Leathes, of Herring Fleet Hall, Yarmouth, informs Mr.\r\n F. Buckland of sea serpents seen from the _White Adder_ off Aden, and\r\n again off New Guinea and the Cape. (See _Land and Water_, Sept. 6,\r\n 1879.)\r\n\r\nIn the above list we are struck by the fact that the coast of Norway\r\nand the northern seas _during the hottest weather_ are the favourite\r\nplaygrounds of these gigantic marine animals, though as for the\r\n‘600’ feet, we must first be assured of Norwegian measurement before\r\nforming any estimate beyond that the creatures were doubtless of great\r\nlength. ‘Witnesses of unimpeachable character’ have produced so much\r\ntrustworthy evidence as far as Norway is concerned, that no doubt any\r\nlonger exists there as to ‘the’ or _a_ ‘marine animal’ of enormous\r\nlength. ‘There is scarcely a sailor who has not seen one,’ it has been\r\nbroadly stated; and Norwegians wonder that English naturalists are so\r\nsceptical on the subject.\r\n\r\nOf still more marvellous proportions was the one seen off the American\r\ncoast in 1819, and which is vaguely described as from 80 to 250 yards!\r\nThat outdoes Norway altogether; but then, of course, an American sea\r\nserpent _would_ exceed all others.\r\n\r\nNext to the Norwegian, the American coast was at one time so favoured\r\nby strange marine ‘monsters,’ that they were commonly reported as ‘the\r\nAmerican sea serpent.’ Excepting these northern Atlantic visitants,\r\nothers have been observed mostly in the eastern seas, rarely in the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThis has given rise to the question, ‘How is it that they are seen\r\nalmost exclusively in the north?’ One reason may be that there are\r\nmore persons to see them, and because marine traffic is far greater\r\nin the north than in similar southern latitudes; and another reason\r\nmay be, that the rocky coasts of both continents in those latitudes\r\nmay afford congenial retreats for mammoth marine reptiles. We have\r\nseen that reptiles exist for a very long period without breathing,\r\nand even without air; as, for instance, those encased in baked mud in\r\nthe tropics, and those frozen up or bottled up tight and hermetically\r\nsealed, as the examples given in preceding chapters.\r\n\r\nFrom long observation of ophidian habits, I venture to offer certain\r\nsuggestions in addition to published opinions; and I may remind my\r\nreaders that as all reptiles undergo a species of hibernation, we may\r\nreasonably conclude that these huge marine ones form no exception to\r\nthe rule. They may lie for months dormant in the deep recesses of the\r\nocean, and reappear during the long days and hot weather like their\r\nland relatives. It seems strange that so far from this having been\r\ntaken into consideration, it has become the fashion to ridicule the\r\n‘reappearance of the great sea serpent’ at the very time when all other\r\nreptiles reappear as a matter of course. Long days are more favourable\r\nfor observations, and probably log-books record many other creatures,\r\nwhether mammal, bird, or fish, seen during the summer and not in other\r\nseasons, as well as ‘sea serpents.’ Not because this is the slack time\r\nof journalists, therefore, who are supposed to be at their wits’ end\r\nfor subjects, but simply because ships coming home at this time bring\r\nreports of their summer observations.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that these reports have come to be\r\nassociated with ‘the gigantic gooseberry,’ and such seasonable wonders,\r\nbecause the door to investigation is thus closed. It is also, to be\r\nregretted that many hoaxes have undeniably been committed to print,\r\nreally to fill up newspaper columns, and feed a love of the marvellous.\r\nProfessor Owen’s words may well be repeated here, ‘It is far harder to\r\nestablish a truth than to kill an untruth.’\r\n\r\nOne more little matter is also to be seriously deplored; and this\r\nis the unscientific habit of calling all these unfamiliar animals\r\n‘monsters,’ a word signifying truly a _monstrosity_, a creature with\r\ntwo heads, a beast with five or six legs instead of four, or other such\r\nmalformations. These are truly monsters, and to use the term otherwise\r\nonly creates mistaken impressions. Inadvertently even scientific men\r\nfall into this habit; naturalists and well-known authorities are seen\r\nin print to talk of these sea ‘monsters,’ but who in the same page\r\ndenounce exaggerated expressions.\r\n\r\nIn _Land and Water_ of September 8, 1877, several of our distinguished\r\nnaturalists contributed papers on the evidence of the officers of\r\nthe royal yacht _Osborne_, relative to a large marine animal seen\r\noff Sicily on June 3 of that year. Professor Owen also acceded to\r\nan earnest request to add a few words on the subject, and it was\r\nnoticeable that more than once in his few pithy lines this eminent\r\nauthority delicately hinted at the mistake of calling animals\r\n‘_monsters_’ without just reason for so doing: ‘The phenomena were\r\nnot necessarily caused by a _monster_,’ he writes; ‘and the words\r\n... denote rather a cetacean than a _monster_.’ Again, ‘There are no\r\ngrounds for calling it a _monster_.’\r\n\r\nOn the occasion referred to, the official reports of the animal seen\r\nwere sent to the Admiralty; and the Right Hon. R. A. Cross, then\r\nSecretary of State for the Home Department, requested the opinion of\r\nMr. Frank Buckland on the matter, the result being a full account given\r\nto the readers of _Land and Water_, to which Mr. F. Buckland was so\r\npopular a contributor. In addition to Owen’s valued opinion, the public\r\nwere favoured with able papers by Mr. A. D. Bartlett, of the Zoological\r\nGardens, Captain David Gray, of the whaling ship _Eclipse_, Mr. Henry\r\nLee, and Frank Buckland himself.\r\n\r\nFrom the discrepancies in the records of the four officers, and the\r\nsketches of nothing in nature which accompanied those records, not one\r\nof those able writers ventured an assertion as to what the strange\r\nanimal could possibly be. The captain—Commander Pearson—‘saw the\r\nfish through a telescope;’ a ‘seal-shaped head of immense size, large\r\nflappers, and part of a huge body.’\r\n\r\nLieutenant Haynes saw ‘a ridge of fins above the surface of the water,\r\nextending about thirty feet, and varying from five to six feet in\r\nheight.’ Through the telescope he saw ‘a head, two flappers, and about\r\n_thirty_ feet of an animal’s shoulder; the shoulder was about _fifteen_\r\nfeet across.’ The animal propelled itself by its two ‘fins.’\r\n\r\nMr. Douglas M. Forsyth saw ‘a huge monster, having a head about fifteen\r\nto twenty feet in length.’ The part of the body not in the water ‘was\r\ncertainly not under forty-five or fifty feet in length.’\r\n\r\nMr. Moore, the engineer, observed ‘an uneven ridge of what appeared\r\nto be the fins of a fish above the surface of the water, varying in\r\nheight, and as near as he could judge, from seven to eight feet above\r\nthe water, and extending about forty feet along the surface.’\r\n\r\nThough we are not able to say what this strange animal really was, we\r\ncan positively affirm what it was _not_. A snake has neither fins,\r\nflippers, flappers, nor ‘shoulders fifteen feet broad;’ therefore\r\nthis assuredly was no ‘sea serpent.’ Nor would it be introduced here,\r\nexcepting as inviting further comment on its mysterious existence.\r\n\r\nAnd curious enough it is to remark the persistence with which all these\r\nanomalies are announced as ‘_the_ sea serpent,’ as if the sea produced\r\nbut one solitary specimen, which is now the shape of a ‘turtle;’ next\r\nof a ‘frog,’ with ‘one hundred and fifty feet of tail;’ then a creature\r\nwith ‘fins’ and a ‘mane,’ ‘flippers’ and ‘flappers’ and ‘ridges of\r\nfins.’ All these appendages are one after the other described, and yet\r\nas belonging to a ‘serpent,’ which has no such appendages.\r\n\r\nA few of the recorders do really describe something more of the true\r\nophidian, and those who do this, not being familiar with ophidian\r\nmanners, are more useful as witnesses than those who at once report a\r\n‘serpent,’ and afterwards proceed unknowingly to disprove their own\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nAmong the more noteworthy, the following account, copied from the\r\nLiverpool papers at the time, is worth considering:—\r\n\r\n ‘The story of the mate and crew of the barque _Pauline_, of London,\r\n said to have arrived in port from a twenty months’ voyage to Akyab,\r\n about having seen a “sea serpent” while on a voyage in the Indian\r\n seas, was yesterday declared to on oath before Mr. Raffles, the\r\n stipendiary magistrate at the police court. The affidavit was made in\r\n consequence of the doubtfulness with which\r\n\r\nanything about the sea serpent has hitherto been received; and to show\r\nthe genuine character of the story, it has been placed judicially on\r\nrecord. The following is a copy of the declaration, which will be\r\nregarded as unprecedented in its way:—\r\n\r\n\r\n‘“_Borough of Liverpool, in the County Palatine of Lancaster, to wit._\r\n\r\n ‘“We, the undersigned, captain, officers, and crew of the barque\r\n _Pauline_ (of London), of Liverpool, in the county of Lancaster, in\r\n the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, do solemnly and\r\n sincerely declare that, on July 8, 1875, in lat. 5° 13´ S., long. 35°\r\n W., we observed three large sperm whales, and one of them was gripped\r\n round the body with two turns of what appeared to be a huge serpent.\r\n The head and tail appeared to have a length beyond the coils of about\r\n thirty feet, and its girth eight or nine feet. The serpent whirled its\r\n victim round and round for about fifteen minutes, and then suddenly\r\n dragged the whale to the bottom, head first.\r\n\r\n  ‘“GEORGE DREVAR, _Master_.\r\n  ‘“HORATIO THOMPSON.\r\n  ‘“JOHN HENDERSON LANDELLS.\r\n  ‘“OWEN BAKER.\r\n  ‘“WILLIAM LEWARN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n ‘“Again, on July 13, a similar serpent was seen about two hundred\r\n yards off, shooting itself along the surface, head and neck being out\r\n of the water several feet. This was seen only by the captain and one\r\n ordinary seaman, whose signatures are affixed.\r\n\r\n  ‘“GEORGE DREVAR, _Master_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n ‘“A few moments after, it was seen elevated some sixty feet\r\n perpendicularly in the air, by the chief officer and the following\r\n able seamen, whose signatures are also affixed:—\r\n\r\n  ‘“HORATIO THOMPSON.\r\n  ‘“WILLIAM LEWARN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n ‘“And we make this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the\r\n same to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of an Act made and\r\n passed in the sixth year of the reign of his late Majesty, intituled\r\n an Act to repeal an Act of the present session of Parliament,\r\n intituled an Act for the more effectual abolition of oaths and\r\n affirmations, taken and made in various departments of the State, and\r\n to substitute declarations in lieu thereof, and for the more entire\r\n suppression of voluntary and extra-judicial oaths and affidavits, and\r\n to make other provisions for the abolition of unnecessary oaths.\r\n\r\n  ‘“GEORGE DREVAR, _Master_.\r\n  ‘“WILLIAM LEWARN, _Steward_.\r\n  ‘“HORATIO THOMPSON, _Chief Officer_.\r\n  ‘“JOHN HENDERSON LANDELLS, _Second Officer_.\r\n  ‘“OWEN BAKER.\r\n\r\n ‘“Severally declared and subscribed at Liverpool aforesaid, the tenth\r\n day of January, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven, before\r\n T. S. Raffles, J.P. for Liverpool.”’\r\n\r\nIn the above descriptions there is no mention of fins, flippers, or\r\nmane, but simply the manners of a huge constrictor, with the head\r\nand the tail free, and the middle portion of its body engaged in\r\ncrushing the prey, a process which may at any time be seen in a captive\r\nconstrictor seizing its food. The ‘whirling its victim’ was, no doubt,\r\nin the struggle between the two, the whale using its powerful efforts\r\nto escape, but being overcome at last. Nor in comparison with the size\r\nof the described serpent would a whale be impracticably large.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the next one seen, the true serpent motion is unintentionally\r\nexhibited in the ‘shooting itself along the surface, the head and neck\r\nbeing several feet out of water.’ Snakes continually advance with their\r\nheads elevated; and their rapid, darting movements are well expressed\r\nby ‘shooting.’\r\n\r\n‘A few minutes after, it was seen elevated some sixty feet\r\nperpendicularly in the air.’ _Sixty feet_ at a guess. Unless some mast,\r\nthe precise height of which was known, or some other perpendicular\r\nobject were in close proximity, it would be exceedingly difficult to\r\nestimate the height. To an unaccustomed eye even twenty or thirty\r\nfeet of snake suddenly darting upright from the waves would be a\r\nstartling and bewildering spectacle; yet we know that land snakes raise\r\nthemselves in this manner one-third, one-half, or for a moment even\r\nmore than that; ‘stand erect,’ some physiologists have stated (see\r\np. 181); so again, unintentionally, and by those not likely to be\r\nfamiliar with ophidian capabilities, is a natural action described.\r\n\r\nIn several other instances, the animal seen has raised its head many\r\nfeet, and ‘let it down suddenly;’ exactly what land snakes do.\r\n\r\nThe one seen from on board H.M.S. _Dædalus_ in 1848 is considered one\r\nof the most circumstantially recorded evidences of some really existing\r\nserpentine animal within the memory of many still living. It was much\r\ncommented upon in the journals of that year, and claims a passing\r\nmention here.\r\n\r\nCaptain M’Quhæ, who commanded the _Dædalus_, in an official report to\r\nthe Admiralty, gave the date of the ‘monster’s’ appearance as August\r\n6, 1848, and its exact locality in the afternoon of that day as lat.\r\n24° 44’ S., and long. 9° 22’ E., which would be somewhere between the\r\nCape of Good Hope and St. Helena. In his own mind the captain had\r\nno doubt whatever as to the nature of the animal, which he simply\r\nreported as an ‘enormous serpent, with head and shoulders kept about\r\nfour feet constantly above the surface of the sea; and as nearly as\r\nwe could approximate, by comparing it with the length of what our\r\nmain-topsail yard would show in the water, there was, at the very\r\nleast, sixty feet of the animal _à fleur d’eau_, no portion of which\r\nwas, to our perception, used in propelling it through the water, either\r\nby vertical or horizontal undulations. There seemed to be as much as\r\nthirty to forty feet of tail as well.’ The animal passed the ship\r\n‘rapidly, but so close under our lee-quarter, that, had it been a man\r\nof my acquaintance, I should easily have recognised his features with\r\nthe naked eye.’ The size of the creature is given as about fifteen\r\nor sixteen inches diameter in the neck ‘behind the head, which was,\r\nwithout doubt, that of a snake.’ No fins were seen, but ‘something like\r\nthe mane of a horse, or rather a bunch of seaweed washing about its\r\nback.’ Its progress was about fifteen miles an hour, and it remained\r\ntwenty minutes in sight.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Drummond, also of the _Dædalus_, reported what he saw, and\r\nfrom his log-book, while the captain’s was from memory. The lieutenant\r\nthought he saw ‘a back fin ten feet long, and also a tail fin.’ The\r\nhead was ‘rather raised, and occasionally dipping, and gave him the\r\nidea of that of a large eel.’\r\n\r\nWithout being an ophiologist, Captain M’Quhæ also unintentionally\r\ndescribes a creature of ophidian habits and proportions. He\r\ninadvertently says ‘shoulders,’ when, as my readers know, a snake has\r\nanatomically no shoulders, any more than ‘neck.’ But for all that, the\r\nraised head, and the absence of any striking movements in the part\r\nvisible, are the manners of a serpent in the water, when propelled\r\nby its tail, which would be out of sight; and the captain simply\r\ndescribing what he saw, but giving no name, those acquainted with\r\nherpetology would at once decide that he described a long-necked and\r\nslender reptile of some sort, perhaps some enormous saurian, whose feet\r\nwere under water, if not a serpent.\r\n\r\nThere were many learned discussions concerning this creature, and for\r\nthese I refer my reader to the journals and scientific publications of\r\nthe time. No one doubted the fact that some strange animal was seen,\r\nbut the wisest refrained from giving it a name. Very similar was the\r\nverdict on the more recent object seen from the _Osborne_ in 1877;\r\nbut in those thirty intervening years a vast stride had been made in\r\nzoological knowledge; and in the very able papers written on this later\r\nphenomenon, we now find a general disposition to accept the fact that\r\nthere _are_ gigantic forms of marine animals existing, that have not as\r\nyet been scientifically described and received into systematic zoology.\r\n\r\nMr. A. D. Bartlett, in the discussion already alluded to, after\r\ndispassionately reviewing and criticizing the evidence of H.M.’s\r\nofficers, thus concludes:—\r\n\r\n ‘When we consider the vast extent of the ocean, its great depth,\r\n the rocky, cavernous nature of the bottom,—of many parts of which\r\n we know really nothing,—who can say what may be hidden for ages,\r\n and may still remain a mystery for generations yet to come; for we\r\n have evidence on land that there exists some of the largest mammals,\r\n probably by thousands, of which only one solitary individual has been\r\n caught or brought to notice. I allude to the Hairy-eared Two-horned\r\n Rhinoceros (_R. lasiotis_), captured in 1868 at Chittagong (where it\r\n was found stranded in the mud), and now known as an inhabitant of the\r\n Zoological Gardens.\r\n\r\n ‘This animal remains unique, and no part or portion was previously\r\n known to exist in any museum at home or abroad.\r\n\r\n ‘(We have here an instance of the existence of a species found on the\r\n continent of India, where for many years collectors and naturalists\r\n have worked and published lists of all the animals met with, and have\r\n hitherto failed to meet with or obtain any knowledge of this great\r\n beast.)\r\n\r\n ‘May I not therefore presume that in the vast and mighty ocean,\r\n animals, perhaps of nocturnal habits (and therefore never, except by\r\n some extraordinary accident, forced into sight), may exist, whose form\r\n may resemble the extinct reptiles whose fossil remains we find in such\r\n abundance.\r\n\r\n ‘As far as I am able to judge from the evidence before me, I have\r\n reason to believe that aquatic reptiles of vast size have been seen\r\n and described by those persons who have endeavoured to explain what\r\n they have witnessed.\r\n\r\n ‘One thing is certain, that many well-known reptiles have the power\r\n of remaining for long periods (months, in fact) at the bottom, under\r\n water or imbedded in soft mud, being so provided with organs of\r\n circulation and respiration that they need not come to the surface\r\n to breathe. The large crocodiles, alligators, and turtles have this\r\n power, and I see no valid reason to doubt but that there may and do\r\n exist in the unknown regions of the ocean, creatures so constructed.\r\n\r\n ‘It may be argued that if such animals still live, they must from\r\n time to time die, and their bodies would float, and their carcases\r\n would be found, or parts of them would wash on shore. To this I say:\r\n however reasonable such arguments may appear, most animals that die\r\n or are killed in the water, sink at first to the bottom, where they\r\n are likely to have the flesh and soft parts devoured by other animals,\r\n such as crustacea, fishes, etc. etc., and sinking in the deep, the\r\n bones, being heavier than the other parts, may soon become imbedded,\r\n and thus concealed from sight.’\r\n\r\nIt was gratifying to me to find my own ideas of hibernation thus\r\nsupported, the above allusion to the probability of temporary repose in\r\nmarine reptiles being the first I had met with.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Lee, in the same issue, reminds us that the existence of\r\ngigantic cuttle-fish was popularly disbelieved until within the past\r\nfive or six years, during which period several specimens—some of them\r\nfifty feet in total length—have been taken, and all doubts upon the\r\nsubject have been removed. He argues, also, that during the deep-sea\r\ndredgings of H.M. ships _Lightning_, _Porcupine_, and _Challenger_,\r\nmany new species of mollusca, supposed to have been extinct ever since\r\nthe Chalk epoch, were brought to light, and that there were brought up\r\nby the deep-sea trawlings from great depths _fishes of unknown species,\r\nwhich could not exist near the surface owing to the distension and\r\nrupture of their air-bladder when removed from the pressure of deep\r\nwater_.\r\n\r\nForcibly suggestive are such facts of still further undiscovered\r\ndenizens of the deep! And as to _what_ they are, fish, mammal, or\r\nreptile, or a compound of either two or all three of these, why doubt\r\n_any_ possibility when we know that on land are similarly complicated\r\norganisms which so lately have perplexed our most able physiologists?\r\nTake, for example, that curious anomaly, the mud-fish of the Gambia,\r\n_Lepidosiren_, referred to in the last chapter, and which, to look at,\r\nis as much like a lizard as a fish, with its four singular appendages\r\nwhere either legs or fins might be. Again, we have that paradox in\r\nnature—bird, reptile, and quadruped combined—in the Australian\r\n_Platypus_, a semi-aquatic animal. ‘These two fresh-water animals\r\nare,’ says Darwin, ‘among the most anomalous forms now found in the\r\nworld; and like fossils, they connect, to a certain extent, orders\r\nat present widely sundered in the natural scale.’[76] Other equally\r\nremarkable links between the various groups might be cited to prepare\r\nus for any marine anomalies which may hereafter surprise us. Taking\r\ninto consideration, also, that many of our smaller aquatic animals\r\nhave their representatives on a huge scale in the ocean, why should\r\nthere not be gigantic ophidian forms to correspond with the terrestrial\r\npythons and anacondas? As in point of size salt-water fishes exceed\r\nthose of our rivers, and as the enormous marine mammalia exceed those\r\non land, we might the rather wonder if there were not _one_ ‘great\r\nsea serpent,’ but many unsuspected species of reptiles, compound\r\nophiosaurians, or saurophidians, or who shall say what, in those\r\ninaccessible depths.\r\n\r\n‘How is it none have ever been captured?’ it is asked. In reply, Has\r\nany one ever captured a swiftly-retreating land snake escaping pursuit?\r\nWho can overtake or circumvent it when in its tropical vigour? And\r\nhow vastly must the powers and swiftness of those immense pelagians\r\nexceed the kinds with which we are familiar! ‘Then, Why have no bones\r\nbeen found?’ Mr. Bartlett’s reason is one of those assigned, and in\r\naddition I may suggest that the love of locality, so strong in land\r\nreptiles, may also exist in marine ones, which probably retire to the\r\nrecesses of their submarine habitats to die.\r\n\r\n‘How is it none have ever been killed?’ Well! A cannon ball on the\r\ninstant, and not much less, would be required to ‘kill it on the spot,’\r\nas some have sagely recommended.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Lee, among others, does not regard capture as impossible\r\nand in support of my own speculations—more correctly speaking\r\n_imagination_, perhaps—I give the concluding words of his paper:—\r\n\r\n ‘I therefore think it by no means impossible—first, that there may\r\n be gigantic marine animals unknown to science having their ordinary\r\n _habitat_ in the great depths of the sea, only occasionally coming\r\n to the surface, and perhaps avoiding habitually the light of day;\r\n and, second, that there may still exist, though supposed to have been\r\n long extinct, some of the old sea reptiles whose fossil remains tell\r\n of their magnitude and habits, or others of species unknown even to\r\n palæontologists.\r\n\r\n ‘The evidence is, to my mind, conclusive that enormous animals, with\r\n which zoologists are at present unacquainted, exist in the “great and\r\n wide sea,” and I look forward hopefully to the capture of one or more\r\n of them, and the settlement of this vexed question.’\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this chapter without further reference to one\r\nother of our very popular physiologists, Dr. Andrew Wilson. The week\r\nfollowing that in which Owen, Captain Gray, and Messrs. Lee, Buckland,\r\nand Bartlett contributed their opinions to _Land and Water_, September\r\n8, 1877, Dr. Wilson also favoured its readers with two closely written\r\npages on ‘The Sea Serpent of Science.’ Some of his introductory words\r\nhave been already quoted. He then presents the claims to attention\r\nwhich these various ‘sea monsters’ offer, as reported by thoroughly\r\ntrustworthy witnesses, suggesting that the idea of a ‘serpent’ is too\r\nrestricted.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding much already said, the opinion of Dr. Wilson will be\r\nvalued by many of my readers, and I therefore give portions in his own\r\nwords:—\r\n\r\n ‘As far as I have been able to ascertain, zoologists and other writers\r\n on this subject have never made allowance for the _abnormal and huge\r\n development of ordinary marine animals_. My own convictions on this\r\n matter find in these the most reasonable and likely explanation of the\r\n personality of the sea serpent, and also the reconciliation of such\r\n discrepancies as the various narratives may be shown to evince.... I\r\n think we may build up a most reasonable case both for their existence\r\n and for the explanation of their true nature, by taking into account\r\n the fact that _the term “sea serpent,” as ordinarily employed, must be\r\n extended to include other forms of vertebrate animals which possess\r\n elongated bodies: and that cases of the abnormally large development\r\n of ordinary serpents and of serpent-like animals will reasonably\r\n account for the occurrence of the animals popularly named “sea\r\n serpents.”_ ...\r\n\r\n ‘Whilst to my mind the only feasible explanation of the narrative of\r\n the crew of the _Pauline_ must be founded on the idea that the animals\r\n observed by them were gigantic snakes, the habits of the animals\r\n in attacking the whales evidently point to a close correspondence\r\n with those of terrestrial serpents of large size, such as the boas\r\n and pythons; whilst the fact of the animals being described in the\r\n various narratives as swimming with the head out of the water would\r\n seem to indicate that, like all reptiles, they were air-breathers,\r\n and required to come more or less frequently to the surface for the\r\n purpose of respiration.’\r\n\r\nApology is due to so eminent a physiologist for having first given\r\nexpression to my own opinion on the _Pauline_ serpent, though in\r\ntardily quoting a high authority I may risk suspicion of plagiarism.\r\nI must be permitted to explain, therefore, that on seeing the subject\r\nventilated in _Land and Water_ (to which I had for some years been a\r\ncontributor on ophidian matters), I also, though uninvited, prepared a\r\npaper on ‘the sea serpent.’ In a letter to the Editors, I even presumed\r\nto criticise part of what had lately appeared, enclosing MS. with yet\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIn reply, I was informed that the subject would not be continued or\r\n‘re-opened,’ and my returned MS. is still before me, much of it now\r\nfor the first time being presented to the public. To proceed with Dr.\r\nWilson:—\r\n\r\n ‘The most important feature in my theory, ... and that which really\r\n constitutes the strong point of this explanation, is the probability\r\n of the development of a huge or gigantic size of ordinary marine\r\n serpents....\r\n\r\n ‘Is there anything more improbable, I ask, in the idea of a gigantic\r\n development of an ordinary marine snake into a veritable giant of its\r\n race; or, for that matter, in the existence of distinct species of\r\n monster sea serpents, than in the production of huge cuttle-fishes,\r\n which, until within the past few years, remained unknown to the\r\n foremost pioneers of science? In the idea of the gigantic developments\r\n of snakes or snake-like animals, be they fishes or reptiles, I hold we\r\n have at least a feasible and rational explanation of the primary fact\r\n of the actual existence of such organisms.’\r\n\r\nIn a most interesting lecture on ‘Zoological Myths,’ delivered at St.\r\nGeorge’s Hall, January 2, 1881, Dr. Andrew Wilson again laid much\r\nstress on the ‘gigantic development of an ordinary marine snake into’\r\none of those amazing individuals which, say, at the very least, are\r\nover a hundred feet in length!\r\n\r\nHow long would the poison fang of such a reptile be? How many ounces of\r\nvenom would its glands contain? Or does the Dr. wish us to understand\r\nthat as the vertebræ of a _Hydrophis_ has gradually developed into\r\nthe complicated structure of a constrictor, so has the poison-fang\r\nbecome gradually obsolete? Appalling, indeed, would it be were those\r\nenormous developments armed with poison-fangs! Monarchs of the deep\r\nthey truly would be. Happily, venomous serpents are restricted in\r\ntheir size; but an interesting speculation has been opened in the\r\nabove theory of abnormal development, and I trust it may be followed\r\nup by abler reasoners than the present humble writer. In the previous\r\nchapter the distinguishing characteristics of the true marine snakes\r\nwere described, and I feel more disposed to agree with Dr. Andrew\r\nWilson when he says, ‘_or for the matter of that, in the existence of\r\ndistinct species of monster sea serpents_,’ than in the development of\r\na small venomous one into an amazing constrictor. Except the ‘monster.’\r\nWhy should not the gigantic forms be perfect in themselves, with an\r\ninherited anatomical structure? In volume xviii. of _Nature_, 1878, Dr.\r\nAndrew Wilson again discusses the sea serpent, and thus concludes:’ ...\r\nand as a firm believer from the standpoint of zoology that the large\r\ndevelopment of the marine ophidians of warmer seas offers the true\r\nexplanation of the sea-serpent mystery.’\r\n\r\nTheir physical constitution, then, as well as structure, must have very\r\nmuch changed to enable them to exist so far from the tropics.\r\n\r\nAnd still there are the creatures with flippers, and flappers, and fins\r\nto decide upon. And then the gigantic salamander with a hundred and\r\nfifty feet of tail! But these not being ophidians, and certainly not\r\n‘sea serpents,’ must not intrude themselves here.\r\n\r\nIn their enormous development alone the supporters of Darwin may justly\r\nexult, for surely in them we shall see ‘the survival of the fittest.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n_RATTLESNAKE HISTORY._\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM the peculiar rattling appendage, with which this snake is armed,\r\nit has excited the notice of European explorers since the very first\r\nsettlement of the American Continent. Whenever a traveller attempted\r\nany printed account of the New World and its products, mention was made\r\nof this ‘viper with the bell.’\r\n\r\nBy and by, in 1762, a live specimen was brought to England, where it\r\narrested the attention of the members of the Royal Society and the\r\nscientific ‘Chirugions’ of the day.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the rattlesnake began to be honoured with a literature\r\nof its own—one which equals if not exceeds in interest that of any\r\nother ophidian history handed down to us; for Cleopatra’s asp has its\r\nliterature, and the _Cobra capella_, and M’Leod’s boa, and some few\r\nother distinguished ophidians, but none so voluminous and inexhaustible\r\nas the American _Crotalus_ with its sonorous tail.\r\n\r\nAnd despite the attention of naturalists for above two hundred years,\r\nit is not yet done with. First its rattle, then its fangs, next its\r\nmaternal affection and the security offered to its young in ‘its own\r\nbosom,’ then its ‘pit,’ and again its rattle—each and all in turn\r\nhave continued to occupy the pen of zoologists as, with the advance of\r\nscience, fresh light has been thrown upon ophiology.\r\n\r\nAmerican naturalists have continually something new to tell us about\r\nthe _Crotalus_, and not even yet have they decided among themselves of\r\nwhat precise use that remarkable rattle is, either to its owner or its\r\nauditors.\r\n\r\nThe various theories regarding its construction, mode of growth, its\r\nage and supposed uses, will occupy the second part of the present\r\nsubject; other rattlesnake features will come in their places, but\r\nfirst an outline of what the early English writers had to say about it\r\nwill not be devoid of interest.\r\n\r\nNatural history as a science was then in its infancy. The Royal Society\r\nof England had as yet no existence; snakes were ‘insects,’ because they\r\nlay eggs; insects were ‘serpents,’ because they creep; and the majority\r\nof all such ‘creeping things’ were ‘venomous,’ of course.\r\n\r\nIn those early days of science there was little or no recognition of\r\nspecies, two, or at most three, different kinds of rattlesnakes being\r\nnamed. The distinguishing rattle seemed enough to separate them from\r\nall other snakes: they were ‘the vipers with the bell,’ or ‘the vipers\r\nwith the sounding tail.’ ‘Vipers’ they were at once decided to be,\r\nconformably with the old idea that vipers, in distinction to every\r\nother kind of snake, produced their young alive. In this respect those\r\nearly observers were correct; and from their general characteristics\r\nthey are still _vipers_ in the eyes of science: that is, they belong\r\nto the sub-order _Viperina_, though their dentition more than any other\r\nfeature separates them from the rest, and we know now that several\r\nnon-venomous snakes produce live young as well as the vipers.\r\n\r\nIn appearance the rattlesnake is so well known that a minute\r\ndescription of it is uncalled for. Throughout the whole genera of the\r\n_Crotalidæ_ the viperine character is seen in the broad, angular,\r\nflattish head; the thinner neck, distinct between it and the thicker\r\nbody; a short, tapering tail, and a generally repulsive appearance with\r\nan evil expression about it, as if no further warning were required to\r\nannounce its deadly qualities.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, many of the rattlesnakes possess an undeniably handsome\r\nexterior. Their colours are for the most part dark and rich, relieved\r\nwith lighter markings and velvety black; often wearing a brilliant\r\nprismatic hue, which still further enriches their tints. And then the\r\nrattle at once announces the name of its owner.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to decide on the writer or traveller from whom we\r\nget the first mention of the rattlesnake, which has an extensive\r\ngeographical range on both the American continents. It was undoubtedly\r\nsome South American explorer early in the sixteenth century, and long\r\nbefore any settlement in the New World had been made by the English.\r\n\r\nIn a rare old book, the first edition of which was published in London,\r\n1614, viz. ‘_Samvel Purchas. His Pilgrimage in all Ages; being an\r\naccount of all the Places discovered since the Creation of the World_,’\r\nwe hear of many Spanish and Portuguese authors who are but little known\r\nin England, and from each and all of whom the indefatigable ‘Pilgrim’\r\nhas culled information. Indeed, the book is a careful compilation\r\nfrom all the previous writers of any worth, though those only who\r\nmentioned the Brazilian serpents need be here introduced to the reader.\r\nThese, in describing some unchanging peculiarities, and in giving us\r\nthe vernacular names then common, have been of much use in assisting\r\nsubsequent writers to identify certain species.\r\n\r\nHakluyt, Hernandez, Master Anthony Kniuet, and many others are quoted\r\nby Purchas, but of them all, ‘No man hath written so absolute a\r\nDiscourse of Brazil as was taken from a Portugall Frier and sold to\r\nMaster Hakluit,’ he tells us; giving at the same time a history of the\r\npersecution and imprisonment of this unfortunate friar, whose unusual\r\nintelligence seems to have rendered him an object of suspicion. Thus do\r\nwe who come after benefit by the misfortunes of our predecessors, and\r\nthus has the stolen ‘Discourse’ of the sixteenth century been turned to\r\naccount for our edification in the nineteenth.\r\n\r\nIn the Portuguese friar’s description of animals, it is not difficult\r\nto separate the true snakes from the ‘Serpentes with foure Legges and\r\na Taile,’ or to identify the rattlesnakes among them. Says the writer,\r\n‘The Boycininga is a Snake called of the Bell: it is of a great Poison,\r\nbut it maketh such a Noise with a Bell it hath in its Tayle that it\r\ncatcheth very few: though it be so swift that they call it the flying\r\nSnake. His Length is twelve or thirteen Spannes long. There is another\r\n_Boycininpeba_. This also hath a Bell, but smaller. It is blacke and\r\nvery venomous.’\r\n\r\nThese two may be _Crotalus horridus_ and _Crotalus durissus_, the two\r\ncommonest; or they may be only one species of a different size, age,\r\nand colouring—a confusion which frequently occurs with even more\r\nrecent and more scientific worthies than the good ‘Pilgrim’ Purchas. In\r\na later edition he says: ‘Other Serpents there are that carrie upon the\r\nTippe of their Tayle a certaine little roundelle, like a Bell, which\r\nringeth as they goe.’\r\n\r\nMarcgrave, in his _Travels in Brazil_, 1648, further helps us to label\r\nthe right snake with the long vernaculars by figuring a rattlesnake\r\nand calling it by the same name, only with an additional syllable,\r\n_Boicinininga_, _quem Cascavel_, the latter euphonious Spanish word,\r\nfor a little round bell, having widely obtained ever since.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first English colony was settled in North America, the\r\nrattlesnake again comes upon the stage. Captain John Smith, whom we may\r\ncall the founder of Virginia (since it was owing to his good judgment,\r\nendurance, and intelligence that the colony did not share the fate of\r\nSir W. Raleigh’s adventurers), tells us of the ornaments worn by the\r\nIndians, and the favour in which certain _Rattells_ were held by them\r\nas amulets. In his _Generall Historie of Virginia_, 1632, Captain Smith\r\ndescribes their barbarous adornments,—birds’ claws, serpent skins,\r\nfeathers with a ‘rattell’ tied on to them, which ‘Rattells they take\r\nfrom the Taile of a Snake,’ and regard with superstitious veneration.\r\n\r\nWith the spirit of enterprise which marked that era, and the discovery\r\nof new countries and strange creatures, ‘Natural History’ began to be a\r\nrecognised science in Europe. Aldrovanus and Gesner had produced their\r\nponderous tomes, and the authors quoted by Purchas were eagerly read\r\nby Ingenious Chirugions, who in England appear to have taken the lead\r\nin science; while at Florence an assembly of ‘Knowing Physicians’ were\r\nexperimentalizing with all the Vipers procurable in Southern Europe,\r\nholding council as to the source of their ‘Mischiefs’ and specific\r\n‘Remedies for their Bitings,’ etc., with just such tests with the\r\n‘Master Teeth’ of both living and dead vipers as have of late again\r\noccupied the attention of living scientists. In 1660 the learned Redi\r\nof Florence published his book on Vipers, and soon after M. Moyse\r\nCharas, a Frenchman, produced a work which would not be a bad textbook\r\neven now.\r\n\r\nAnd for the Scientific World what greater stimulus could arise than\r\nthe foundation of the ROYAL SOCIETY by Charles II., and the channel\r\nfor ventilating discoveries and inventions which their published\r\n_Transactions_ afforded? Very early in these do we find that viper\r\npoison was engaging professional attention, and soon did communications\r\nappear from those ‘knowing physicians’ at Florence. A correspondence\r\nsprang up between M.D.’s of England, France, and Italy; and the\r\ndetails of their experiments proved very inciting to the members of\r\nthe Royal Society of London, who with the limited subjects at their\r\ndisposal—virtually only our own little English viper—also set\r\nthemselves to work to analyze the ‘Poyson Bag.’\r\n\r\nOne enthusiast, Mr. Platt, addressing the Royal Society from Florence,\r\nwith an account of some of the experiments then going on, made mention\r\nof the M. Charas who had written such an important work, and ended by\r\nhoping to animate the _virtuosi_ here to ‘do something that may be not\r\nunworthy your knowlege.’[77]\r\n\r\nThat the work of M. Moyse Charas was translated into English the\r\nfollowing year, proves that the English _virtuosi_ had really become\r\n‘animated’ in the looked-for direction.[78]\r\n\r\nIn the preface of his book we read: ‘If Reflexion be made on the many\r\nWonders that are found in the Body of this Animal’ (the viper), ‘it\r\nwill be easily granted that it cannot be inquir’d into with too much\r\nExactness: and that it is not a Work that can be finish’t at one or two\r\nSittings.’\r\n\r\nThis little digression from the rattlesnake is not without its object;\r\nfor from this correspondence through the _Philosophical Transactions_\r\nwe may date the birth of ophiological science in England; and the\r\nreader will be able to place himself on that standpoint in order to\r\nreciprocate the kind of interest with which such an entirely strange\r\nand as yet unknown serpent as a rattlesnake was received a short time\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nIn vol. x. 1676, there is ‘An Account of Virginia, its Situation,\r\nTemperature,’ etc., communicated by Mr. Thomas Glover, ‘an ingenious\r\nChirugion that hath lived some years in the Country.’\r\n\r\nThis gentleman tells us of the climate and productions of the new\r\ncolony, not omitting those of the animal and vegetable kingdoms;\r\namong the various strange creatures which he describes in the crude\r\nlanguage of the time are five or six sorts of snakes, amongst which\r\n‘the Rattlesnake is the most remarkable, being about the bigness of a\r\nMan’s Legg, and for the most part a yard and a half long. He hath a\r\nRattle at the End of his Tail, wherewith he maketh a Noise when any one\r\napproacheth nigh him: which seemeth to be a peculiar Providence of God\r\nto warn People to avoid the Danger; for this Creature is so venomous\r\nthat the Bite of it is of most dangerous Consequence, unless they make\r\nuse of the proper Antidote, of which I shall take occasion to speak\r\nsomewhat hereafter.’\r\n\r\nSuch accounts, coupled with the interest awakened in the members of\r\nthe Royal Society by the Florentine experimentalists, caused the first\r\narrival of a rattlesnake in England to be a grand era in ophiological\r\nannals; and with its eventful appearance began its scientific history.\r\n\r\nThe published records of the _Philosophical Transactions_ again\r\nperpetuate the impressions it created, and also many collateral points\r\nof interest.\r\n\r\nA paper entitled _Vipera Caudisona Americana; or, The Anatomy of a\r\nRattle-Snake_, was read by Dr. Edward Tyson, of the Royal Medical\r\nCollege of London, in 1683; who dissected one at the repository of the\r\nRoyal Society in Jan. 1682. (The above scientific name is erroneously\r\nattributed to Laurenti, 1768.)\r\n\r\nThat nothing of much value to science was previously known about\r\nthe reptile we gather from Dr. Tyson’s introductory words. ‘It were\r\nmightily to be wisht that we had the most compleat account of so\r\n_Curious_ an _Animal_. This which we _Dissected_ was sent to Mr. Henry\r\nLoades, a merchant in London, from Virginia, who was pleased not only\r\nto gratify the _Curiosity_ of the Royal Society, in showing it them\r\nalive, but likewise gave it them when dead.’\r\n\r\nThus did Mr. Loades unconsciously immortalize himself in the history\r\nof rattlesnakes. Merchants in those days were not F.Z.S.’s; and it is\r\nprobable that he thought of nothing beyond ingratiating himself with\r\nthe members of a learned Society by presenting them with a ‘serpente’\r\ndead, whose ‘Bell’ had excited their curiosity when living; and he\r\nlittle dreamed that the origin and use of this strange _bell_ would not\r\nbe determined two hundred years afterwards.\r\n\r\nSays Dr. Tyson: ‘I find the inward parts so conformable to those of a\r\nViper that I have taken the liberty of placing it in that Classe and\r\n(since it has not that I know of any Latine Name) of giving it that of\r\n_Vipera Caudisona_: for as I am informed by Merchants ‘tis Viviparous,\r\nand the Epithet sufficiently differences it from those that have no\r\nRattle.’\r\n\r\nThis scholarly anatomist had evidently devoted much careful labour to\r\nthe task of hunting up all the literature that could throw any light on\r\nhis much-prized specimen. He had no doubt been one of those ‘animated’\r\nby the Florentine savants, and had made himself acquainted with all\r\nthe viperine characters. He had doubtless read all that had already\r\nappeared in the _Philosophical Transactions_, and also the narratives\r\nof such _voyageurs_ as Hakluyt, Hernandez, Piso, and Marcgravius.\r\n\r\nAmong the useful results of his researches he is able to give us many,\r\nwe may say most, of its vernaculars in the countries of the New World\r\nsettled by Europeans up to that date; and as in subsequent books of\r\ntravel we hear of the rattlesnake frequently under these vernaculars,\r\nuntil, as of later years, its ordinary English name has been familiar\r\nto all, we have had a good deal to thank him for, were it only this.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the authors already named, he gives us Guliemus Piso,\r\nJohnston, Merembergius, and ‘others that have wrot of it, and its\r\nanatomy, under the names of Boigininga or Boiginininga and Boiquira,\r\nwhich are its Brazile Names. By the Portuguese it is called Casca\r\nvela and Tangador: by the Dutch, Raetel Sclange; by those of Mexico,\r\nTeutlaco-cauehqui or Teuhtlacotl zauhqui, _i.e. Domina Serpentum_: and\r\nfrom its swift motion on the Rocks like the wind, Hoacoatl.’\r\n\r\nMinutely and scientifically was that ‘viper with the sounding tail’\r\ndissected and studied out by Dr. Tyson just two hundred years ago; and\r\nthe excellent illustrations with which his description was elucidated\r\nwere subsequently used in many first-class physiological works.\r\n\r\nNot even the ‘pit’ escaped the notice of that nice anatomist,—the\r\n‘nasal fosse,’ or ‘sort of second nostril,’ as it was for a long while\r\ncalled,—and its use conjectured, and which has given to a very large\r\ngroup of venomous serpents the name of ‘pit vipers,’ the peculiar\r\norifice not being confined to the American _Crotalus_ alone (see chap.\r\nxxi.).\r\n\r\n‘Between the nostrils and eyes are two other orifices which at first\r\nI took to be Ears,’ he tells us, speaking of this ‘pit,’ ‘but after\r\nfound they only led into a Bone that had a pretty large cavity, but\r\nno perforation.’ He had seen that vipers—the European vipers which\r\nhe had previously known—had not these orifices. Then he comments on\r\nthe great Provision of Nature in furnishing the strong, smooth ‘belly\r\nscales,’ (see illustration, p. 193), and the ‘very long trachea of 20\r\ninches. _Nature_ is mightily provident in supplying them with _Air_, in\r\nbestowing on them so large a Receptacle for receiving it.’\r\n\r\nTyson quotes from the ‘contests between the noble Italian Redi, and\r\nthe Frenchman M. Charas,’ as to the source of the poison in vipers,\r\nand makes discoveries for himself, as for instance the mobility of the\r\njaw in elevating and depressing the fang, the structure of the teeth,\r\nand various other matters which in this book are discussed in their\r\nseveral chapters, but which were then for the first time scientifically\r\ndescribed in English by Tyson.\r\n\r\nTrue that a little traditional gossip about the rattle, which he had\r\ngathered from less competent sources, creeps in towards the conclusion\r\nof the paper. While the learned M.D. writes from his own observations\r\nand scientific knowledge, he affords valuable information; and we can\r\ndispense with the hearsay of the day. However, all honour be to Dr.\r\nTyson of two hundred years ago, who was the first to give us ‘The\r\nAnatomy of the Rattlesnake,’ and its first scientific name.\r\n\r\nAs the two American continents became more widely known to Europeans,\r\nand Englishmen were seized with a desire to visit the new colonies,\r\nbooks of travels and descriptions multiplied too rapidly for even a\r\npassing mention in these pages; though wherever the slightest approach\r\nto natural history was included, the rattlesnake figured conspicuously.\r\nOf those works frequently quoted by naturalists, Seba’s _Rerum\r\nNaturalium Thesauri_ in 1735, of four ponderous volumes, containing\r\ntext in both Latin and French, and profusely illustrated, must not be\r\nomitted, though about the _Crotalus_ he has not much new to tell us.\r\nHe quotes Tyson and others, and explains that the many nearly similar\r\nnames are ‘_selon la difference de prononciation des Bresiliens,\r\nqui la nomme aussi Boiquira_;’ and he thinks all these names ‘_ne\r\ndésignent qu’une seule et même vipère_.’ To these various titles of\r\n‘one and the same viper,’ we shall refer again in chap. xxiii. To\r\nthe list he adds that the English call it ‘rattlesnake;’ the French,\r\n‘_serpent à sonnettes_;’ and Latin authors, _Anguis crotalophorus_\r\n(or the rattle-bearing snake). He also gives us another Mexican name,\r\n‘_Ecacoatl, qui signifie le Vent, parce qu’elle rampe avec une extrème\r\nvitesse sur les rochers_.’\r\n\r\nThis extreme activity in the rattlesnake is not in accordance with\r\nour alien experience. Still we hear of it from more than one writer\r\nand in widely separated habitats. The Mexican and Brazilian words may\r\nhave alluded to the rapidity of motion in striking its prey, and which\r\nin its swiftness can scarcely be followed. Or it is possible that the\r\nreptile which as a captive in our chilling climate is so slow and\r\nsluggish, may, when stimulated by a tropical sun and under peculiar\r\nexcitement, occasionally exhibit a vivacity incredible to us who see it\r\nonly in menageries. Regarding other species of viperine snakes, we have\r\nsometimes similar evidence; and there is nothing in the structure of\r\nthe _Crotalus_ to contradict it.\r\n\r\nOne more of the unpronounceable Mexican names we must inflict on the\r\nreader, to show how this serpent was distinguished among all others\r\neven in length of title. F. Fernandez, or Hernandez, in his _Animalium\r\nMexicanum_, p. 63, A.D. 1628, calls it Teuchlacotzauhqui, because it\r\nsurpasses all others in ‘_l’horrible bruit de sa sonnette_.’\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, anybody who could see this remarkable snake on its\r\nnative soil was ready to tell something about it; and from the time\r\nthat Dr. Tyson dissected his specimen and made it better known to the\r\n‘Curious,’ many other communications saw light through the pages of\r\nthe _Philosophical Transactions_ during the next few years.\r\n\r\nIn experimenting to discover the source of the ‘mischief,’ one skilful\r\n‘Chyrurgeon’ proved that the gall of vipers is not venomous, only\r\nbitter.\r\n\r\nA Mr. John Clayton, in an _Account of the Beasts in Virginia_, 1694,\r\ntells us the rattlesnake’s ‘Tayle is composed of perished Joynts like\r\na dry Husk. The Old shake and shiver these Rattles with wonderful\r\nNimbleness; the Snake is a Majestick sort of Creature, and will scarce\r\nmeddle with anything unless provoked.’ He also describes the ‘fistulous\r\nTeeth’ and the poison being injected through these ‘into the very mass\r\nof the blood.’ Effective remedies are spoken of, as if not much doubt\r\nof a cure existed. An Indian was bitten in the arm, who ‘clapt a hot\r\nburning coal thereon and singed it stoutly.’\r\n\r\nIn Italy experiments still went on, and a Mr. C. J. Sprengle wrote to\r\nthe Royal Society from Milan (1722), that in a room opened at the top\r\nwere sixty vipers from all parts of Italy. ‘Whereupon we catch’d some\r\nmice and threw them in, one at a time, among all that number of vipers;\r\nbut not one concerned himself about the mice, only one pregnant viper\r\nwho interchanged eyes with the mouse, which took a turn or two, giving\r\nnow and then a squeak, and then ran with great swiftness into the chops\r\nof the viper, where it gradually sunk down the gullet.’ And from this\r\nsinister proceeding on the part of the viper, Mr. Sprengle argues a\r\nfact generally borne out in zoological collections ever since, namely,\r\nthat venomous snakes in captivity will not eat until they become\r\nreconciled.\r\n\r\nAnd so by degrees these many interesting ophiological facts have been\r\nworked out and established. In 1733, vol. xxxviii., some experiments\r\nmade by Sir Hans Sloane are recorded. A dog was made to tread on a\r\nrattlesnake which bit him. In one minute of time the dog was paralytic\r\nin the hinder legs, and was dead in less than three minutes.\r\n\r\nAnother subject of subsequent interest and even importance was some\r\nobservations made by Sir Hans Sloane on the ‘Charms, Inchantments, or\r\nFascinations of Snakes,’ in reply to communications by Paul Dudley,\r\nEsq., F.R.S., and Col. Beverley, both of whom believed that the\r\nrattlesnake could bring a bird or a squirrel from a tree into their\r\nmouths by the power of their eye.\r\n\r\nA word on fascination will come in its place, but as a part of\r\nrattlesnake history Sir Hans Sloane may be quoted here. And yet a\r\nreason so long ago suggested by him, who _thoughtfully_ watched a\r\nsnake, seems almost entirely to have escaped notice. He thinks ‘the\r\nwhole mystery of charming or enchanting any Creature is simply this.\r\nSmall Animals or Birds bitten, the poison allows them time to run a\r\nlittle way (as perhaps a bird to fly up into a tree), where the snakes\r\nwatch them with great earnestness, till they fall down, when the snakes\r\nswallow them.’[79]\r\n\r\nSir Hans Sloane quotes a good deal from the work by Colonel\r\nBeverley,[80] and the observations made by him; particularly one which\r\nthe author remarks is a ‘curiosity which he never met with in print,’\r\nviz. the instinct which displays itself so strongly _after death_ in\r\nthe rattlesnake. A man chopped off the head and a few inches of the\r\nneck of a rattlesnake, and then on touching the ‘springing teeth with\r\na stick, the head gave a sudden champ with its mouth,’ thus displaying\r\nthe impulse to bite. He noticed the action of the springing teeth ‘when\r\nthey are raised, which I take to be only at the will of the snake to do\r\nmischief.’ Strange to tell, many of the above peculiarities have been\r\ndescribed as ‘new to science’ within forty years.\r\n\r\nBut among those who wrote of our American colonies, Lawson must not\r\nbe omitted. Describing the ‘Insects of Carolina,’ viz. alligators,\r\nrattlesnakes, water snakes, swamp snakes, frogs, great loach, lizards,\r\nworms, etc., he tells us what was then new about the subject of this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n‘The Rattlesnakes are found on all the Main of America that I ever had\r\nany Account of: being so called from the Rattle at the End of their\r\nTails, which is a Connexion of jointed Coverings of an excrementitious\r\nMatter, betwixt the Substance of a Nail and a Horn, though each Tegment\r\nis very thin. Nature seems to have designed these on purpose to give\r\nWarning of such an approaching Danger as the venomous Bite of these\r\nSnakes is. Some of them grow to a very great Bigness, as six Feet\r\nin Length; their Middle being the Thickness of the Small of a lusty\r\nMan’s Leg. They are of an orange, tawny, and blackish Colour on the\r\nBack, differing (as all Snakes do) in Colour on the Belly; being of an\r\nAsh Colour inclining to Lead. The Male is easily distinguished from\r\nthe Female by a black Velvet Spot on his Head; and besides his Head\r\nis smaller-shaped and long. Their Bite is venomous if not speedily\r\nremedied; especially if the Wound be in a Vein, Nerve, Tendon, or\r\nSinew, when it is very difficult to cure. The Indians are the best\r\nPhysicians for the Bite of these, and all other venomous Creatures of\r\nthis Country. The Rattle-Snakes are accounted the peaceablest in the\r\nWorld, for they never attack any One or injure them unless trodden\r\nupon or molested. The most Danger of being bit by these Snakes is for\r\nthose that survey Land in Carolina; yet I never heard of any Surveyor\r\nthat was killed or hurt by them. I have myself gone over several of\r\nthis Sort; yet it pleased God I never came to any Harm. They have the\r\nPower or Art (I know not which to call it) to charm Squirrels, Hares,\r\nPartridges, or any such Thing, in such a Manner that they run directly\r\ninto their Mouths. This I have seen,’ and so forth.... ‘Rattle-Snakes\r\nhave many small Teeth of which I cannot see they make any Use; for they\r\nswallow every Thing whole; but the Teeth which poison are only four;\r\ntwo on each side of their Upper-Jaws. These are bent like a Sickle,\r\nand hang loose, as if by a Joint. Towards the setting on of these,\r\nthere is in each Tooth a little Hole, wherein you may just get in the\r\nPoint of a small Needle. And here it is that the Poison comes out and\r\nfollows the Wound made by the Point of their Teeth. They are much more\r\nvenomous in the Months of June and July than they are in March, April,\r\nor September. The hotter the Weather the more poisonous. Neither may\r\nwe suppose they can renew their Poison as oft as they will; for we\r\nhave had a Person bit by one of these who never rightly recovered it,\r\nand very hardly escaped with Life; and a second Person bit in the same\r\nPlace by the same Snake and received no more Harm than if bitten with a\r\nRat. They cast their Skins every Year and commonly abide in the Place\r\nwhere the old Skin lies. These cast Skins are used for Physick, and\r\nthe Rattles are reckoned good to expedite the Birth.’ ... ‘Gall mixed\r\nwith Clay and made into Pills are kept for Use and accounted a noble\r\nRemedy.’ ... ‘This Snake has two Nostrils on each Side its Nose. Their\r\nVenom I have Reason to believe effects no Harm any otherwise than when\r\ndarted into the Wound by the Serpent’s Teeth.’\r\n\r\nThis description, being an early and excellent illustration of what has\r\nsince been termed ‘Practical Natural History,’ is given at length, and\r\nbecause Lawson has been a good deal quoted by subsequent writers.\r\n\r\nSo again is Catesby, who went to Virginia in 1712, staying seven\r\nyears ‘to gratify a passionate desire to view animal and vegetable\r\nproductions in their native country.’ He was the first to figure and\r\nto describe two distinct species. It is admitted that he did much\r\nfor natural history, and his drawings are by far the best that had\r\nas yet appeared. Catesby therefore claims a conspicuous place among\r\nrattlesnake historians.\r\n\r\nBy this time, 1731, nine or ten of the American colonies had celebrated\r\ntheir first centenary, and had made considerable advances towards\r\ncivilisation. In the parts visited by Catesby a good deal of the old\r\nEnglish refinement marked the character and manners of the people. But\r\na little domestic incident in the house where he was staying is related\r\nby him, and affords us an insight of a less attractive character in\r\nplantation life.\r\n\r\nThe largest rattlesnake Catesby ever saw was eight feet long, and\r\nweighed eight or nine pounds. ‘This Monster was gliding into the House\r\nof Col. Blake, and had certainly taken up his Abode there undiscovered,\r\nhad not the Domestic Animals alarmed the Family with their repeated\r\nOutcries: the Hogs, Dogs, and Poultry united in their Hatred to him,\r\nshowing the greatest Consternation by erecting their Bristles and\r\nFeathers, and showing their Wrath and Indignation surrounded him; but\r\ncarefully kept their Distance, while he, regardless of their Threats,\r\nglided slowly along.’\r\n\r\nIt was not at all an uncommon occurrence for rattlesnakes to come into\r\nhouses at that time, nor indeed has it been long since then in secluded\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nCatesby himself had a narrow escape once, when he occupied a room on\r\nthe ground floor, and a rattlesnake was found snugly coiled in his bed.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding a growing acquaintance with the rattlesnake among the\r\nF.R.S.’s, to the general public it was still almost unknown.\r\n\r\nEven in the middle of the eighteenth century an itinerant exhibitor\r\ncould say what he pleased about it to a too credulous public. An\r\nextract from an old newspaper suggests an ancestral Barnum joining\r\nhands with a journalist to make a fortune out of one thus exhibited.\r\nNot so much was expected of journalists in those days; but even now,\r\nso far as snakes are concerned, a vast number of errors creep into\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n ‘A BEAUTIFUL RATTLESNAKE ALIVE.\r\n\r\n ‘This exotic Animal is extremely well worthy the Observation of\r\n the Curious: Its Eyes are of great Lustre, even equal to that of a\r\n Diamond, and its Skin so exquisitely mottled and of such surpassing\r\n Beauty as baffles the Art of the most celebrated Painter: It is about\r\n five Feet long, and so sagacious, that it will rattle whenever the\r\n Keeper commands it: There is not the least cause for Fear, though\r\n it were at Liberty in the Room: but that the Ladies may be under no\r\n Apprehension on that Account, it is kept in a Glass-Case. It is very\r\n Active, and is the first ever shown alive in England.’—From _The\r\n General Advertiser_, LONDON, Sat., Jan. 4th, 1752.\r\n\r\nAny ‘sagacity’ displayed in this exhibition was on the part of the\r\nkeeper, who had discovered the exceeding timidity of this reptile, and\r\nhad observed that it used its rattle whenever alarmed or provoked.\r\nHowever, the timidity answered very well for obedience, and no doubt\r\ndrew many spectators.\r\n\r\nA notable feature in the rattlesnake was its fecundity and prevalence.\r\n\r\nThis we gather from all who in the early days of American history\r\nhad anything to tell us of the country and its inhabitants. Whether\r\nthe subject of their pen were Topography, Indians, or Productions, a\r\nrattlesnake crept in. Collateral evidence of this kind, given with no\r\nmotive for exaggeration, nor even as ‘natural history,’ may therefore\r\nbe accredited.\r\n\r\nA slaughter of rattlesnakes was as much an annual custom as the\r\nslaughter of hogs. Regularly as a crop of hay came a crop of\r\nrattlesnakes. On account of the oil manufactured from their fat, the\r\nslaughter partook also of a commercial character; but more commonly\r\nit was a war of extinction, like the battles with the Indians.\r\nUsually an annual, frequently a biennial, crusade was undertaken, the\r\nsettlers being well acquainted with their habits and retreats. It was\r\na well-known fact that, towards the close of summer, and on the first\r\nindication of frost, the reptiles returned simultaneously and in vast\r\nnumbers to a favourite spot. Not only hundreds but thousands make for\r\nthis winter rendezvous year after year.\r\n\r\nCatlin, the Indian historian, tells us that near Wilkesbarre, in\r\nPennsylvania, his birth-place, was a cavern in the mountains called\r\nRattlesnake Den; and to this cavern the snakes made an annual\r\npilgrimage, collecting from vast distances, no matter what obstacles\r\nwere in their way. Across rivers and lakes, and up mountain sides,\r\nstraight to their Den they would go, and in those unapproachable\r\ncaverns lie _en masse_ in a torpid state until aroused by the coming\r\nsummer, when they would venture forth again and descend into the\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\nThese were the times for the grand _battues_, one of which, an event of\r\nCatlin’s boyhood, is narrated by him.\r\n\r\nOne of the first spring days, when the creatures creep out to sun\r\nthemselves for only a few hours, retiring again at night, was the time\r\nchosen for the onslaught. The snakes were known to come forth from\r\nRattlesnake Den on to a certain ledge of rock near their cavern; and a\r\ncouncil of war was held as to the best approach and mode of attack. Ten\r\nyears previously a similar war had been waged, when the reptiles had\r\nbeen almost exterminated; but of late so many accidents had occurred\r\namong the inhabitants through the fast-increasing serpents, that the\r\nfarmers agreed to climb to the den and once more reduce their numbers.\r\nThe boy Catlin was privileged to be of the party, and he was told\r\nto creep cautiously to an overhanging rock, whence he could see the\r\nreptiles sunning themselves on their ledge below. The rest of the party\r\nstood in readiness, club in hand. At a signal young Catlin fired a\r\nfowling-piece into their midst. There was a knot of them ‘like a huge\r\nmat wound and twisted and interlocked together, with all their heads\r\nlike scores of hydras standing up from the mass.’ Into this horrible\r\ncluster he ‘let fly,’ when the party, rushing with their clubs, broke\r\nthe spine of hundreds by a single blow to each, while hundreds more\r\nwere saving themselves by a quick return to their den.\r\n\r\nWhile counting the five or six hundred slain, and holding another\r\ncouncil of war on the battle-field, a rattle was heard of one which in\r\nthe death-struggle had escaped over a ledge instead of into its cave.\r\nWith a forked stick a man approached that misguided reptile and held\r\ndown its head, while another brave expert seized it by the neck so\r\nclose to its head that it could not turn and bite him.\r\n\r\nIt was a very large snake, and young Catlin, inspired by the sudden\r\nthought, exclaimed, ‘Tie a powder-horn to its tail and fasten a slow\r\nfuse to it, and let it go back into its den.’\r\n\r\n‘George, you are the best hunter in the Valley of Ocquago!’ cried the\r\nman who held the snake; and forthwith the plan was agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThe largest powder-horn in the party was filled to the brim from the\r\nother horns, and tied to the snake’s tail by a string of several feet\r\nlong; and to the horn was fixed a slow fuse of about a yard in length,\r\nmade of wetted, twisted tow, in which gunpowder was rolled. This\r\naccomplished while the reptile was still firmly held, it was then set\r\nfree close to the mouth of its den, the whole party speedily escaping\r\nto a safe distance.\r\n\r\nListening, they heard the horn rattling over the rocky floor as the\r\nsnake was carrying it home into the midst of its comrades, when, after\r\nthe silence of a minute or so, an explosion like a clap of thunder\r\nshook the ground on which they stood, and blue streams issued forth\r\nbetween the crevices around the den, and a thick volume from its mouth.\r\n\r\nRattlesnake Den was thus cleared of its inhabitants for many long years.\r\n\r\nCatlin affirms that the Valley of the Wyoming used to be more infested\r\nwith these terrible pests than any other portion of the globe. Every\r\nsummer the lives of persons as well as cattle were destroyed by them,\r\nand the ‘happy little valley’ would have been rendered uninhabitable\r\nbut for the periodical _battues_.[81]\r\n\r\nHowe in his Histories of Ohio and of Virginia relates many similar\r\nfacts. A Mr. Stone, one of the first settlers of the ‘Western Reserve’\r\nalong the shore of Lake Erie, has immortalized himself as a slayer of\r\nrattlesnakes. They were ‘in great plenty along the track,’ and he being\r\nthe first to ‘survey’ the land in 1796, had the honour of doing battle\r\nwith them. In Trumbull County they abounded. One year, about the first\r\nof May 1799, a large party armed with cudgels proceeded to a sunny\r\nlevel of rock on which hosts of the reptiles had crept. Approaching\r\ncautiously, step by step, the enemy came upon them suddenly, and then\r\nbegan to cudgel with all their might. Hot and furious was the fight;\r\nthe rattles were ringing as the snakes beat a retreat up the hill, and\r\nthe ground was strewed with the slain: four hundred and eighty-six were\r\nthat day collected, most of them over five feet in length.\r\n\r\nIn another of these spring campaigns eight hundred rattlesnakes were\r\nkilled, including a few of their relatives the copper-head, and\r\nhundreds more of harmless snakes of which the slayers ‘took no account.’\r\n\r\nHolbrooke records that once in New York State two men in three days\r\nkilled 1104 rattlesnakes on an eastern slope of Tongue mountain.\r\n\r\nMany hairbreadth escapes during these adventures form the subjects of\r\nexciting stories in the domestic annals of American settlers, but are\r\nbecoming more and more histories of the past. In many localities where\r\nformerly rattlesnakes swarmed, they have almost totally disappeared or\r\nhave become very rare. Probably with their friends the Indians, they\r\nwill in time become wholly extinct.\r\n\r\nNew species have, however, been discovered by the explorers of the new\r\nWestern States and in Tropical America, where, in the sparsely-settled\r\ndistricts, they still come into houses as of yore, and where the\r\nrattlesnake campaign is still an annual sport for the venturesome\r\npioneers. In 1872, two thousand of the species _Crotalus confluentus_\r\nwere killed in the Yellowstone Region.\r\n\r\nOne other question in the history of the rattlesnake—‘Does it swallow\r\nits young in times of danger?’ or more correctly speaking, ‘Does\r\nit receive its young into its œsophagus as a place of safety?’—is\r\nconsidered in chap. xxvii.\r\n\r\nOther discussions of modern times, both in assemblies of zoologists\r\nand through printed correspondence, have been on the rattle, when and\r\nwhy vibrated, how affected by damp, etc., all claiming a place in\r\nrattlesnake history, but considered elsewhere in this work. A whole\r\nvolume might be written on this rattling tail, evolved out of the\r\nscant materials of the sixteenth century into the prolific matter of\r\nthe nineteenth. You can scarcely take up one of the many scientific\r\njournals of the United States, in which zoology forms a part, without\r\nfinding mention of a rattlesnake. Within a very few years the subject\r\nhas been popularized in our own zoological journals also.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the venom come of course the cures, concerning\r\nwhich the experiments of Dr. Weir Mitchell form a notable point in\r\nrattlesnake history. But serpent venom and its remedies, so far as lies\r\nwithin my province to discuss them, come also in a special chapter.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this one, I will roughly enumerate the species of\r\nrattlesnakes now best known. We have seen that formerly only one or\r\ntwo different kinds were noticed, and the subsequent multiplication\r\nof species is due almost as much to science and to a more careful\r\nobservation of the distinguishing features, as to the discovery of\r\nabsolutely new ones.\r\n\r\nThe frequent Exploring Expeditions fitted out by the United States\r\nGovernment for Geographical Boundaries, Pacific Railroads, Geological\r\nSurveys, etc., with always a zoologist on their Staff of Scientific\r\nMen, have added much to our knowledge of natural history; and in the\r\nReports and Bulletins of these may be sifted out information in every\r\nbranch of Science. Thus in _Crotalus_ chronicles, our two original\r\nrattlesnakes have increased and are still increasing. In 1831, the\r\nlate Dr. J. E. Gray, of the British Museum Natural History Department,\r\nenumerated six genera and eleven species belonging to America. In 1860,\r\nDr. Weir Mitchell gave about twenty species as belonging to two genera\r\nonly, and distinguished by their head scales.\r\n\r\nAs this book has no scientific pretensions, and as its aim is rather to\r\ninterest a large class of readers than systematically to instruct the\r\nfew, I will not attempt a list of genera and species with all their\r\nperplexing names, if indeed a true list of all the now known species\r\neven exist. They are distinguished by the shields or plates on the\r\nhead, and by the varying tails. Some have rattles so small as barely to\r\nentitle them to the name of _Crotalus_.\r\n\r\nThen, again, a new name is frequently adopted by the discoverer of\r\na new feature; and a number of American genera, _minus_ a rattle\r\naltogether, are included among the _Crotalidæ_, an anomaly which will\r\nbe presently explained. Here we have to do with only the rattlesnake\r\nproper, viz. the ‘Viper with the Bell,’ _Vipera caudisona_ of Tyson,\r\nand the _Crotalus_ of Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis word _Crotalus_, simply a rattle, from the Greek word _crotalon_,\r\nand the Latin _crotalia_ and _crotalum_, a kind of castanets, is as\r\nsuitable as any that could possibly have been assigned to the snake;\r\nand most of the generic names are compounds of it: _Crotalophorus_,\r\nrattle-bearing; _Crotalina_, little rattle; _Crotaloidæ_;\r\n_Urocrotalon_, rattling tail; or simply _Crotalus_. Then the specific\r\nname more especially describes the snake in colour, size, character,\r\nlocality, etc., as _Oregonus_, from Oregon; _Kirtlandii_, from Dr.\r\nKirtland of Ohio, who first described that species; _horridus_, from\r\nthe hideous, terrible character of this large snake; _miliarius_, a\r\nvery small one; _caudisona_, sounding tail; and so on.\r\n\r\nTheir geographical range is from about 45° north, to the Gulf of\r\nMexico, Texas, and southward; and in South America to about the same\r\ndegree of climate and temperature as in the northern latitudes. They\r\nare most virulent in the hottest seasons, the tropical regions, and\r\naccording to their size; though, as is the case with other venomous\r\nsnakes, a small species in hot weather and with a large store of venom\r\nmay be more noxious than the largest in a half-torpid state and with a\r\nsmall supply of venom.\r\n\r\nThere is one known as the ‘Prairie rattlesnake;’ another frequents the\r\nmarshy districts of Ohio; another, the swamps of the Southern States\r\nalong the coast; a fourth is known as the ‘Western rattlesnake;’ some\r\nof the 20 species described in the United States being more abundant in\r\nthe mountainous regions, others near the rivers.\r\n\r\nIn the wilder regions of Central and South America they also abound;\r\nbut less is known of them where there are no United States Exploring\r\nExpeditions to record them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n_THE RATTLE._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS _Crepitaculum caude_, as an American has called it, has been the\r\ntheme of many speculations. Its origin and its use have been discussed\r\nalike by the scientific and the unscientific, nor have they even now\r\narrived at any very definite conclusions on these two points. There\r\nare theories as to its development, its form and size, its age and its\r\nutility, the caprice witnessed in all of these adding to the romance\r\nof its history; and whether its length increases by a link annually,\r\nor on each occasion of desquamation, have been among the questions\r\nconnected with it. If we believe what the American Indians declare,\r\nan additional joint to the rattle grows whenever a human being falls\r\na victim to that particular snake—a tradition more poetical than\r\nrational. The Indians also think the rattle vibrates more in dry than\r\nin wet weather, and are therefore cautious in traversing the woods\r\nduring rainy seasons. This belief has given rise to the idea that the\r\nrattle is affected by damp—a fact which was affirmed so long ago\r\nas 1722.[82] The most reasonable clue to this is, that there may be\r\nless to disturb the reptile at a time when all animated nature is to a\r\ncertain extent inclined to retirement and repose; for if the reptile\r\nbe disturbed, rain or no rain, the rattle vibrates. In English as well\r\nas in American scientific journals, the subject of the rattle is ever\r\nand again ventilated by physiologists, and new suggestions are thrown\r\nout. In the present chapter I will endeavour to give a sort of digest\r\nof all these theories, venturing to offer in addition the results of my\r\nown observations. Appended is a drawing of the first rattle I ever saw\r\nor had in my possession. It is associated with a delightful visit of\r\nseveral months to some very dear friends in Iowa, and it recalls more\r\nparticularly one lovely September afternoon. We were driving along a\r\nwild country road, where the prairie on either side was radiant with\r\nits floral carpet, and where the Mississippi gleamed like a succession\r\nof lakes between the wooded and picturesque bluffs that formed the\r\nbackground to the east.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the horses refused to advance, and without any visible reason\r\nto _me_; but the friend who was driving us recognised, in what seemed\r\nto be merely a little dry twig in the middle of the road, nothing less\r\nthan a young rattlesnake.\r\n\r\nNow, to see a rattlesnake and to hear its rattle had been the great\r\nambition of my prairie sojourn, and as my friend threw the reins to his\r\nwife and alighted to deal a death-blow, I entreated him to spare it for\r\na few minutes only that I might examine and hear the as yet unfamiliar\r\nappendage.\r\n\r\nAlas! the creature had no rattle. ‘It is too young: there is only\r\nthe _button_,’ as my friend called the rudimentary promise of one. I\r\nprofited by the occasion, however, to have a good though disappointed\r\nlook, not unmixed with contempt, at the juvenile Crotalus, being so\r\nvery small and unworthy the ceremony. A foot or so in length, it began\r\nto make its escape into the long grass, when by one quick stamp of his\r\nheel our champion disabled it.\r\n\r\nThen, throwing it into a pool of water, he remounted, and the horses\r\nfearlessly proceeded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A fully developed rattle of a rather small snake (life\r\nsize).]\r\n\r\nA few days after this, to compensate my disappointment, I was presented\r\nwith a ‘full-grown rattle’ from a Kentucky snake, and here it is.\r\n\r\nAsking how he knew it was ‘full grown,’ my friend explained that the\r\nlinks being all of a nearly uniform size, proved that the snake had\r\nalso attained a certain growth during the development of that rattle.\r\nThis will be more readily comprehended on seeing the next specimen,\r\nwhich is the rattle of a Mexican snake during early and rapid growth,\r\nand a very perfect one, presenting no flaw or friction; proving that it\r\nhas not been subject to very long or very rough usage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A very perfect rattle (natural size).]\r\n\r\nIn texture this is scarcely so stout as the shaft of a quill, nor so\r\npale, but almost as transparent. As regards size, the terminal link or\r\n‘button’ may be compared to the nail of a young child, the intermediate\r\nlinks gradually increasing with the growth of the snake to the nails of\r\nolder children, and the largest link to that of a full-grown person.\r\nFrom the form of this rattle—an accurate copy of the original—we\r\nmay infer that it grew rapidly at first, and that the snake was large\r\nduring the development of the later links.\r\n\r\nThe next, reduced in size, is the rattle of a snake which had attained\r\nfull growth, but from which the younger or earlier links with the\r\nterminal ‘button’ are gone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of a long rattle, much reduced in size.]\r\n\r\nExtending this specimen by imaginary converging lines, we form an idea\r\nof what its length might have been if perfect, probably about twenty\r\njoints, which is a not unusual number; but we perceive at once that\r\na rattle, as we happen to see it, is no criterion of its age or its\r\noriginal form. Rarely is a snake seen with a long rattle perfect and\r\nentire. But whenever it gradually tapers and ends with the pointed\r\nterminal link, we may decide that that rattle has escaped injury from\r\nits earliest development.\r\n\r\nIn form it is not unsymmetrical, and in substance it is horny, like\r\nhair, nails, quills, and hardened skin, a sort of dense and corneous\r\nintegument, yet less solid than horns and claws. The links, being\r\nonly interlocked and yet elastic, can be easily separated, and are\r\nconsequently easily injured. An animal treading on the rattle of a\r\nsnake would cause a portion at least to be lost; or in being drawn\r\namong roots and entangled vegetation, a rattle might easily get\r\ndamaged: the number of links can never, therefore, be an infallible\r\nclue to the age of the reptile.\r\n\r\nLike hair, horns, nails, it is also subject to a caprice in growth,\r\nor to the vigour of the individual; at one time comparatively at a\r\nstand-still, at another growing rapidly; in one season gaining perhaps\r\nseveral links, in another season none.\r\n\r\nNeither does the number of joints bear any relation to the casting of\r\nthe skin, any more than the growth of hair or nails depends on the\r\nhealing of a scar. The slough, cast more or less frequently, may leave\r\nthe rattle intact, or a new link may appear at such a time. Dr. Cotton,\r\nof Tennessee, had a rattlesnake which shed its skin on an average twice\r\na year, and he observed a new link to the rattle on each shedding.\r\nOn the contrary, a rattlesnake at the London Zoological Gardens,\r\nand in the collection for about ten years, had never a rattle worth\r\nmentioning. Quite a young snake of only 15 inches when brought, it grew\r\ninto a fine healthy specimen, fully five feet long, and yet had never\r\nmore than what Americans call the button—not quite even that, but\r\nmerely an abortive pretence of unhealthy growth, as if one or two links\r\nwere consolidated. I watched that rattle for several years with much\r\ninterest. Thus it was when my attention was first drawn towards it;\r\nand though it sometimes gave promise of growing, and once did indeed\r\ngain another link, it soon got broken off, and never attained more than\r\nthree misshapen joints.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: All there was of it! From life.]\r\n\r\nThough no rattle is ordinarily developed until the snakeling is some\r\nmonths old, several cases are on record where young snakes have been\r\nborn with the ‘button,’ and even with perfectly formed links. Mr.\r\nBenjamin Smith Barton, an American who wrote a good deal about the\r\nCrotalus, communicated to Prof. Zimmermann in 1800 that he had found\r\nin a parent some young ones with three rattles, _i.e._ ‘links,’ each.\r\nSimilar and more recent cases are on record.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Transparent rattle (p. 296), held against the light.]\r\n\r\nIn colour a rattle is of a dark brown, or dull rusty black,\r\noccasionally lighter when fresh and uninjured, and then more plainly\r\ndisplaying its horny texture. In the Mexican rattle (p. 296) the\r\nlinks were semi-transparent; sufficiently so to enable us to trace\r\nthe form of the interior links if held against the light. This\r\nafforded an admirable opportunity to comprehend the structure and\r\nthe production of the sound, which is simply and truly a rattling of\r\nthese loosely-fitting links as they are partially embraced, each one\r\nby the previous link. That is to say, each new link grows up into\r\nits predecessor, pushing it forward towards the tip of the rattle.\r\nThrough this unusually clear rattle you can trace each link passing up\r\nand fitting into the preceding (prior) one, just as so many thimbles\r\nor cups would fit into each other. Only, in the case of thimbles or\r\ncups, there is nothing to keep them in place, and the slightest shake\r\nwould detach the whole pile; whereas the lobes or bulging sections of\r\neach link prevent any such detachment in a rattle, except by force or\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nThe next is the rattle of a small Oregon snake. This, as is\r\nobservable, is old and very much worn; so much so, indeed, that one has\r\nto handle it with care. It is, however, pulled apart intentionally to\r\nshow that the links vary in form from those of the tapering specimen.\r\nAny rattle can thus be separated without much effort, as, owing to the\r\nelasticity of the substance, not much resistance presents itself. The\r\nlinks are just loose enough to produce that sibilant effect, like the\r\nrustling of dry leaves, or of ripe beans in a pod; or still more, like\r\nthe seed vessel of our own native plant the Yellow Rattle, _Rhinanthus\r\nCrista galli_, and the American ‘Rattle-Box,’ _Crotalaria sagittalis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Small divided rattle.]\r\n\r\nYet just so securely fitting it is as to permit of the continual\r\nvibration without loss of links.\r\n\r\nWhat we _see_, therefore, is only the base or lower lobe of each joint,\r\nthe rest running up into the next two or even three bases, as may be\r\ntraced in the section here given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of rattle.]\r\n\r\nIn reading about the construction of a rattle, some perplexity may\r\noccur from the various adverbs before, behind, first, last, previous\r\nlink, etc., some referring to age, others to place. Descriptions\r\nof the rattle met with in popular physiological works prove the\r\nabove perplexities, and verify what is so often demonstrated, viz.\r\nthe ‘inability of unscientific persons to read scientific matter\r\ncorrectly.’ The ‘last’ link means the one last grown, not the end one\r\nof the tail; ‘pushing the preceding one _forward_’ is not towards the\r\n_head_ of the reptile, but literally _outward_ and _backward_ towards\r\nthe tip of the tail. ‘Previous’ may mean in time, or the age of the\r\nlink, or it may mean position; but a knowledge of the development\r\nassists the comprehension of such passages.\r\n\r\nIn the above illustrations it will be seen that not only do rattles\r\ndiffer in form in various species of snakes, but that the links\r\nthemselves differ in form in one and the same rattle. Some of them are\r\nbroader than others, some wider, and some more compressed. In all the\r\nabove drawings I carefully and faithfully copied the originals. And\r\nin this variability we can only refer again to claws, nails, horns,\r\nfeathers, etc., which are seen to differ in the same individual,\r\naccording to health, season, or accident.\r\n\r\nWhere great numbers of rattlesnakes have been killed in one locality,\r\nas, for instance, during the ‘spring campaigns,’ their tails\r\nhave presented on an average from fifteen to twenty links each.\r\nHolbrooke[83] has seen one of twenty-one links. A Crotalus at the\r\nLondon Reptilium had twenty-five links at one time; then ten of them\r\ngot broken off, but still a respectably-sized rattle remained. The\r\nlonger the rattle, the greater the risk of injury. Oliver Wendell\r\nHolmes, in his wonderful story _Elsie Venner_, states that a snake\r\nin the locality where the Rocklands ‘Rattlesnake Den’ existed, had\r\nforty joints in its rattle, and was supposed, after Indian traditions,\r\nto have killed forty people. He tells us that the inhabitants of\r\nthose parts were remarkable for acute hearing even in old age, from\r\nthe practice of keeping their ears open for the sound of the rattle\r\nwhenever they were walking through grass or in the woods. And whenever\r\nthey heard the rattling of a dry bean-pod, they would exclaim, ‘Lord,\r\nhave mercy upon us!’ the sound so strongly resembling that of the\r\ndreaded Crotalus.\r\n\r\nAnother American naturalist records a snake with forty-four links\r\nto its rattle, but adds that this occurrence is rare and ‘a great\r\ncuriosity.’ So one would imagine, and that the fortunate possessor of\r\nsuch an ensign must have flourished in smooth places. More favoured\r\nstill was a snake mentioned in the vol. of the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ just now quoted, and in which Paul Dudley had ‘heard it\r\nattested by a Man of Credit that he had killed a Rattlesnake that had\r\nbetween 70 and 80 Rattles (_i.e._ links), and with a sprinkling of grey\r\nHairs, like Bristles, all over its Body.’ As this venerable Crotalus\r\nmust have rusticated nearly two hundred years ago, we must accept the\r\ntale or tail with caution.\r\n\r\nThe family of the _Crotalidæ_, it will be borne in mind, embraces a\r\nlarge number of serpents with only a rudimentary rattle; a number with\r\nonly the horny spine (see p. 176); and a few with a rattle so small\r\neven when fully developed, that they are received into the family by\r\ncourtesy rather than by their ‘sounding tail.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA small snake with this pretence of a rattle is dangerous because it is\r\nso indistinctly heard.\r\n\r\nThis is also the case with _Crotalus miliarius_, whose rattle is so\r\nfeeble as to be scarcely audible a few feet off.\r\n\r\nSo much for the size of rattles. Now for the development of them.\r\n\r\nThe theory that the rattle is the remains of cast-off cuticle, as some\r\nherpetologists have supposed, may be dismissed at once; for what would\r\ncause such vestiges to harden into a complicated and symmetrical form?\r\n\r\nTo Dumeril we owe some of our best conceptions of the growth of the\r\nrattle, which, whether it has or has not been evolved from the mere\r\nhorny spine that terminates the tails of so many snakes, has certainly\r\n_now_ an express provision for its production.\r\n\r\nLike hair, claws, or nails, the rattle is horny matter excreted and\r\nhardened. In his _Elementary Lessons in Physiology_, Prof. Huxley\r\nshows us how in the growth of a nail new epidermic cells are added to\r\nthe base, constraining it to move forward. ‘The nail, thus constantly\r\nreceiving additions from below and from behind, slides forward over\r\nits bed and projects beyond the end of the finger.’ If the reader will\r\nlook at his finger nail, and suppose the end bone of the Crotalus spine\r\nto be the ‘bed’ of the nail, he will to a certain extent be able to\r\ncomprehend how the rattle grows out; but that the links become detached\r\nin succession is a phenomenon so astonishing and at the same time so\r\ndifficult to comprehend, that few naturalists have ventured to state\r\npositively how this occurs. Conjecturally only and diffidently do I,\r\ntherefore, presume to offer a supposition; and if my readers will\r\nonce more pardon reference to human nails, and lend the aid of their\r\nimagination, they may be able to evolve a true theory out of my crude\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nThe young readers of _Aunt Judy’s Magazine_ were also, a few years\r\nago,[84] invited to lend the aid of their pink little finger nails to\r\nthe illustrative development of a supposed rattle; and we will again\r\nimagine the whole tip of a finger to be covered with a round nail-cap,\r\nproceeding from the first joint, and to have grown so from birth. In\r\ngrowing out, this curious, cup-like nail, being never cut, would become\r\nhollow like a thimble. Pointed or tapering it would of course be,\r\nbecause, as the baby finger grew, the base or new portion of nail grew\r\nlarger with it. We will also suppose that the joint whence the nail\r\nsprang was in constant activity, and so articulated that it _could_\r\nmove with a quick and regular action or vibration; the hollow nail-cap,\r\nhaving attained a certain size, would become withered, and (as the\r\nconstant bending of a piece of card or metal in time divides it) would\r\nbe worn, and at length detached at its base. Meanwhile the growth of\r\nnail has not been arrested, but a new cap is forming within. The old,\r\ndry, and withered cap has now nothing to retain it, and would drop off,\r\non account of its simple, conical form, like a loose-fitting thimble.\r\nBut Dumeril explains to us that the terminal bones of the rattlesnake’s\r\nspine present a peculiar form, several of them coalescing.\r\n\r\n ‘Dans les Crotales cette extremité de la queue, au lieu d’être\r\n pointue, se trouve comme tronquée, et, par une bizarrerie que nous\r\n n’expliquons pas, il paraîtrait que les trois dernières pièces de la\r\n colonne vertébrale se seraient soudées entre elles, et comme aplaties\r\n pour composer un seul os triangulaire, avec trois bourrelets latéraux\r\n simulant des restes d’apophyses transverses des vertèbres, ainsi\r\n qu’on les voir souvent dans les trois dernières pièces du coccyx\r\n chez l’homme. Cet os anormale a été disséqué chez un Crotale, on a\r\n reconnu qu’il est recouvert d’une sorte de matière cartilagineuse dans\r\n laquelle aurait été secretée la substance cornée, comme un epiderme\r\n solide, qui conserve en effet extérieurement la forme de la pièce\r\n osseuse, sur laquelle elle a été en quelque sorte moulée et qu’elle\r\n semble destinée ainsi à protéger contre l’exfoliation, comme cela\r\n s’observe dans ceux des animaux ruminants dont la corne revêt les\r\n chevilles osseuse du véritable coronal prolongé en pointe et devenu de\r\n cette façon une arme d’attaque, et surtout de defence.’[85]\r\n\r\nDumeril also tells us that the peculiar structure of those few terminal\r\nvertebræ, with their knobs or pads (‘_bourrelets_’) upon which the skin\r\nis moulded, tends to a movement lateral rather than up and down,—that\r\nquick action which we perceive when the rattle is being vibrated.\r\nThus the horny covering takes the form of this bone with its lobes\r\nor bulges, which instead of permitting the supposed cup-like nail to\r\nfall off as in our finger illustration, causes the links as they are\r\npushed out to hang or cling together; and we can only suppose that the\r\nconstant action loosens, and not only loosens when dead or detached,\r\nbut loosens, that is to say, enlarges, the link while growing. For if\r\nyou examine the spine of a skeleton Crotalus and the rattle that grew\r\nupon that spine, you will perceive that the links are a great deal\r\nlarger than the ‘_pièce osseuse sur laquelle elle a été en quelque\r\nsorte moulée_.’\r\n\r\nThere is one other peculiarity observable in a detached rattle, which I\r\ncannot pretend to explain in any way. If you hold one up by its base or\r\nlargest link, you will find it invariably hangs in a slight curve and\r\nnot perpendicularly. You can straighten it, but you will not be able to\r\ncurve it in the opposite direction, proving that it naturally inclines\r\none way, whether to the right or the left of the animal while living, I\r\ncannot assert. But it is a curious feature, and one that can no doubt\r\nbe accounted for by scientific observers. Thus, as in the illustration\r\nbelow, you can curve a rattle so as to discern the interior links on\r\none side, but not on the other. I have made the attempt with many\r\nrattles, but always with the same result. The centre fig. below is a\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Natural position when held.\r\n\r\nStraightened by force.\r\n\r\nThis fine specimen, natural size, and also the Tapering Rattle, both\r\nfrom Mexico, were lent to me by J. G. Braden, Esq. of Lewes, and copied\r\naccurately.]\r\n\r\nNot the least important of all the speculations to which the rattling\r\ntail has given rise, is the question, ‘Of what use is it?’ for we know\r\nthat nothing exists in vain. Apart from the fact that the American\r\nsavages make some medicinal use of the rattle, this elaborated,\r\ncurious, and not unsightly instrument has as yet had no special and\r\ndetermined office assigned to it to the advantage of its possessor,\r\nthough theories regarding it are numerous.\r\n\r\nFormerly, when only the dangerous powers of the reptile were\r\nunderstood, it was sufficient to say of it in a tone of pious\r\nthankfulness, that the Almighty had so armed this serpent as a warning\r\nto its enemies. Some of those early writers introduce the rattlesnake\r\nto us as the most benevolent and disinterested of dumb animals,\r\nconscientiously living up to his duties, obedient to that ‘peculiar\r\nProvidence’ which has given him a rattle ‘to warn the inadvertent\r\nintruder of danger.’ ‘He maketh such a noise that he catcheth very\r\nfew,’ an evidence of imprudence wholly inconsistent with his inherited\r\n‘wisdom.’ Indeed, between the character given of this ‘superb reptile’\r\nby Chateaubriand, and the self-sacrificing qualities assigned it by\r\nsome other writers, we can only wonder how a hungry rattlesnake ever\r\nmanaged to survive at all, and how it is that the race is not extinct\r\nlong ago.\r\n\r\nThat the early and unscientific travellers, speaking from a thankful\r\nexperience of having escaped a rattlesnake through _hearing_ where\r\nit was, should seek no further for the utility of the rattle, is not\r\nmuch to be wondered at. But so lately as 1871 one of our popular\r\nphysiologists, whose work is a textbook, has expatiated on this\r\ntheme so positively that it is necessary to quote his words on this\r\n‘admirable provision of nature,’ which apparently has elaborated a\r\nunique appendage for the purpose of starving its proprietor!\r\n\r\n‘The intention of this organ is so obvious, that the most obtuse\r\ncannot contemplate it without at once appreciating the beauty of the\r\ncontrivance.... It (the snake) announces the place of its concealment,\r\neven when at rest, to caution the inadvertent intruder against too near\r\nan approach.’[86]\r\n\r\nIf all the venomous serpents were thus beneficently armed (the cobras\r\nof India especially), the crusade against snakes would be at an end, or\r\nnever need have been instituted; for supposing the heedless loiterer to\r\nhave been a bird, squirrel, guinea-pig, or any of the lesser mammalia\r\nwhich form the food of most snakes, these happy creatures would have\r\nhad the world to themselves long ago, while vipers had kindly starved\r\nthemselves out of all traces.\r\n\r\n‘Every creature of God is good,’ we must repeat and ponder over. Even\r\na deadly rattlesnake, and every part of that rattlesnake, has its\r\nappointed use.\r\n\r\nThe ‘inadvertence’ (in this instance on the part of the writer who thus\r\nexpressed himself) has not been without its use as well, for a more\r\ncareful attention has been given to the rattle in consequence; and much\r\ncontroversy has since arisen among some of the ablest herpetologists,\r\nparticularly in America, where much that was new and suggestive soon\r\nfound its way into the scientific journals.\r\n\r\nBriefly to summarize some of the arguments, I will repeat a few of them\r\nas suggested by some well-known naturalists. In that able periodical,\r\nthe _American Naturalist_, vol. vi. 1872, the subject was thoroughly\r\ndiscussed. Professor Shaler, in a paper on ‘The Rattlesnake and Natural\r\nSelection,’ admitted that whereas he had hitherto thought and taught\r\nthat the rattle did more harm than good to its owner, he now knew that\r\nthe sound is so similar to that of the stridulating insects upon which\r\nsome birds feed, that he had no doubt of its use in attracting these\r\nto the snake. He himself had mistaken the sound for a locust. ‘Does\r\nit invite its enemies or entice its prey?’ he asks. ‘Those snakes\r\nthat can best attract birds, are best fed.’ In reply to this, a Mr.\r\nJ. W. Beal of Michigan affirmed that he had often mistaken the sound\r\nfor grasshoppers; which educed many similar accounts from persons who\r\nhad been in danger of treading on a Crotalus through ‘inadvertent\r\napproach,’ supposing that only an insect were there. A child had taken\r\nit for a cicada, some one else for a locust, etc. Any one who is\r\nacquainted with the wild parts of the American Continent, is familiar\r\nwith the ceaseless chirps and whizzings of those ubiquitous insects\r\nwhich are furnished with the stridulating apparatus, and which lead you\r\nalmost to expect to see a scissors-grinder behind every tree. These\r\nare all the more deceptive on account of their varying cadences, now\r\nlouder, now softer, approaching or receding, just as the sound of the\r\nrattle varies by increased or less rapid vibrations, or according to\r\nits individual size and strength. In a paper read before the Zoological\r\nSociety by Mr. A. R. Wallace in 1871, he invited attention to this fact\r\nof the resemblance between the sound of the rattle and the singing of a\r\ncricket, and that its use seemed to be to decoy insectivorous animals.\r\n\r\nDr. Elliott Coues is also of this opinion, viz. that to an unpractised\r\near the sound cannot be distinguished from the crepitation of the large\r\nWestern grasshopper. A case has been reported, he tells us, of a bird\r\nobserved to be drawn within reach, thinking it was a grasshopper. Dr.\r\nCoues also affirms that the sound has been heard when no perceptible\r\nirritation disturbed the snake.[87]\r\n\r\nThus we see that the ‘inadvertent intruder,’ so far from being warned\r\naway, is beguiled to his injury, both in the case of human beings not\r\nquick to discriminate sounds, or not having rattlesnakes in their\r\nminds, and with animals in their early experience who perhaps hear one\r\nfor the first time.\r\n\r\nAnother question is, ‘Does the snake sound its rattles when seeking to\r\ncapture prey?’\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _American Naturalist_ in the volume already quoted,\r\nthinks they do not systematically set up a rattling for this purpose;\r\nand as far as observation of snakes in confinement can be of use, this\r\nopinion may be confirmed. Probably a captive snake may have learned\r\nby experience that, hungry or not, it must wait for its periodical\r\ndinner, and that its ‘dinner bell’ avails it nothing. Nevertheless, we\r\ndo not find that the snake uses its rattle upon food being placed in\r\nits cage, unless the rat or the guinea-pig come tumbling unexpectedly\r\nor unceremoniously upon the snake, when it would sound its rattle in\r\nalarm; but it waits quietly, silently, rather receding than advancing\r\ntowards the destined prey, and then, after cautious observation,\r\nstealthily approaching to give the fatal bite. Mr. Arthur Nicols,\r\nauthor of _Zoological Notes_, etc., has there discussed this point,\r\nbut dismisses it by declaring he has no faith in ‘the dinner-bell\r\ntheory.’[88]\r\n\r\nNor can the rattle be designed to terrify enemies or as a menace, since\r\nthe sound would invite the attack of those very animals which the snake\r\nhas most cause to fear, namely goats, hogs, and the large carnivorous\r\nbirds that devour it. If, besides, it were used as a warning, why have\r\nthe young ones, which are more in need of protection, no rattle?\r\n\r\nDarwin, in the sixth edition of his _Origin of Species_, 1872, writes\r\nas follows, p. 162:—\r\n\r\n‘It is admitted that the rattlesnake has a poison-fang for its own\r\ndefence and for the destruction of its prey; but some authors suppose\r\nthat at the same time it is furnished with a rattle for its own injury,\r\nnamely to warn its prey. I would almost as soon believe that the cat\r\ncurls the end of its tail when preparing to spring in order to warn\r\nthe doomed mouse. It is a much more probable view that the rattlesnake\r\nuses its rattle, the cobra expands its frill, and the puffadder swells\r\nwhilst hissing so loudly and harshly, in order to alarm the many birds\r\nand beasts which are known to attack even the most venomous species.\r\nSnakes act on the same principle which makes a hen ruffle her feathers\r\nand expand her wings when a dog approaches her chickens.’ This profound\r\nthinker, then, is one of those who include the rattle among ‘the many\r\nways by which animals endeavour to frighten away their enemies.’\r\n\r\nWe may reasonably conclude that the _Crotalus_, in common with other\r\nsnakes, also with dogs and cats, expresses a variety of feelings with\r\nits sounding tail, fear being the most predominant one. The Indians\r\nrecognise its utility as a warning by gratefully abstaining from\r\nkilling one that rattles. They superstitiously regard it as protective\r\nto themselves if not to the snake, and they in turn carefully protect\r\nthe reptile. Backwoodsmen display little or no fear when they _hear_\r\nthe _Crotalus_, and though they do not spare it, regard it with less\r\nbitter animosity than they display towards its cousin the Copper-head;\r\nbecause, as a facetious writer has testified of it, ‘it never bites\r\nwithout provocation, living up to the laws of honour, and by his\r\nrattles giving challenge in an honourable way.’\r\n\r\nThat the sound has a language of its own is known by the fact that\r\nwhen disturbed and one rattle is sprung, all other rattlesnakes within\r\nhearing take up the chorus. That the sexes also understand each other\r\nthrough crotaline eloquence is generally believed. In fact, to each\r\nother and to themselves they have, no doubt, as many variations in the\r\nuse of their rattles, as any other animal in the expression of its\r\ntail; and probably all the above enumerated examples are at one time or\r\nanother its legitimate uses. Those who have most closely observed them\r\nhave detected a variety of cadences in one and the same rattle.\r\n\r\nThose also who have carefully watched rattlesnakes under various\r\ncircumstances, must perceive that timidity is one of the strongest\r\nfeatures in this reptile. In chap. xxx. I will give examples of this.\r\nAlready convinced by observation, I attributed to excessive timidity\r\nthe chief agitation of the rattle, when writing on the Ophidia in the\r\n_Dublin University Magazine_, December 1875, and again in _Aunt Judy’s\r\nMagazine_, July 1877. Fear causes some snakes to puff themselves;\r\nothers to expand or flatten the body; fear excites the cobra to erect\r\nits anterior ribs and display its ‘hood;’ and, above all, fear causes\r\nmost snakes to hiss. Fear is coupled with anger, in these attempts\r\nto do their best towards repelling the offender. Dr. E. Coues, in\r\nspeaking of the rattle, supposes it to have possibly ‘resulted in the\r\ncourse of time from the continual agitation of the caudal extremity\r\nof these _highly nervous and irritable creatures_.’ Dr. Weir Mitchell\r\nhas known captive snakes to vibrate the rattle for hours at a time;\r\nand probably, if there were opportunities of becoming more intimately\r\nacquainted with crotaline idiosyncrasies, we should discover some\r\nsnakes to be more or less afflicted with temper, nervousness, terror,\r\nor other emotions which induce an animal to express its feelings in its\r\nown way.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable peculiarity in this snake is that no other\r\nway _is_ in its power: _a rattlesnake never hisses_. Throughout the\r\nnumerous arguments, theories, explanations, and suggestions, there is\r\nsuch an absence of allusion to this fact that we must suppose it to\r\nbe very little known. Says Dumeril in describing _les petits étuis\r\ncornés, comparé à celui que feraient plusieurs grelots peu sonorés:\r\n‘Les Crotales diffèrent de tous les autres serpents connus par la\r\nfaculté qu’ils ont de produire des sons sourds et rapides, cu plutôt\r\ndes bruits continus et prolongés à l’aide d’un organe spécial, qui\r\nsupléerait—pour ainsi dire—à la voix, dont ces serpents sont toujours\r\nprivés.’_[89] But the sibilations of the rattle are often so like\r\nhissing that they have been compared to the whistling of wind among\r\nthe leaves, to the escape of water through a pipe, to the whizzing of\r\ninsects, the rattling of seed pods, and many similar sounds, showing at\r\nthe same time the character of the noise and its variability.\r\n\r\nConcisely recapitulating what this rattle does, we understand that in\r\nthe first place it is a substitute for the voice—so far as hissing can\r\nbe called voice; and that what would cause other excessively nervous,\r\ntimid, terrified snakes to hiss, causes the rattle to vibrate. It may\r\nattract insectivorous birds; it may alarm other timid creatures; it\r\nmay summon its mate; and, as is well known, it has sympathy with its\r\nmate; for a second rattle is almost sure to be sounded, and they have\r\nbeen observed to sound in pairs or numbers responsively—it may be\r\nto express anger, fear, and for aught we know _pleasure_, in a state\r\nof liberty and enjoyment, feelings expressed by the tail of other\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\nWhy it is formed as it is, so wholly different from all other tails;\r\nfrom what it has been evolved; and how long in evolving,—all these are\r\nproblems to be solved by future Darwins and future Evolutionists.\r\n\r\nThis chapter, therefore, closes with only feeble speculations after\r\nfeeble attempts to explain an inexplicable phenomenon. The simplest and\r\ntruest solution seems to be found in those few words, ‘_qui supléerait\r\nà la voix, dont ces serpents sont toujours privés_.’\r\n\r\nAgain, we wonder whether in the non-hissing serpents any peculiarity of\r\ntrachea may be observed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n_THE INTEGUMENT—‘HORNS,’ AND OTHER EPIDERMAL APPENDAGES._\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING decided that in animal organization nothing exists without its\r\nespecial use; assuming also that the peculiar development of cuticle\r\nforming the rattle is to supply the deficiency of voice, we are next\r\ninduced to examine those other appendages in serpents which are also\r\nmodifications of the integument, such as the ‘horns’ of the Cerastes,\r\nthe tentacles, snout-protuberances, and developments occasionally seen\r\nabout the head of snakes, and which have all, no doubt, their uses.\r\n\r\n‘Serpents are naked,’ says Günther—that is, they have no separate\r\nepidermal productions in the way of fur, feathers, hair, or wool,\r\nand all the variations of form in scales are but the folds of the\r\nepidermis.[90] The ‘variations of form’ include, therefore, the\r\nappendages above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe heads of most snakes are covered with non-imbricated plates or\r\nshields. The form and position of these shields are in a great measure\r\nused in classification; ‘are of the greatest value for distinction\r\nof species and genera.’[91] For this reason each and all of the head\r\nshields are specially named.\r\n\r\nOphiologists differ slightly in distinguishing them as regards\r\nassigning the exact position of some of the shields, which, like all\r\nother ophidian features, vary in closely allied species. As, for\r\nexample, while one naturalist may decide that a certain shield is\r\nexactly over the eye, another may consider it somewhat to the right or\r\nthe left.\r\n\r\nGünther’s classification being the one now generally adopted, I copy\r\nthe names assigned by him, and the diagrams given in his work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n_Fig. 1._ Top of the head of a Colubrine snake. _r_, rostral; _f’_,\r\nanterior frontal; _f_, posterior frontal; _v_, vertical; _s_,\r\nsupraciliary; _o_, occipital; _t_, temporal.\r\n\r\n_Fig. 2._ Profile of the same. _t_, temporal; _p_, posterior ocular or\r\norbital; _a_, anterior ocular or præorbital; _l_, loreal; _n_, nasals;\r\n_uu_, upper labials; **, lower labials.\r\n\r\n_Fig. 3._ Under side of the same. **, lower labials; _cc_,\r\nchin-shields; _m_, mental or median lower labial.]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that some of these shields can be seen both in the\r\nprofile and the others as well; as, for instance, the temporal and the\r\nlabial or lip shields. The study of them is simplified by the initial\r\nletter of each name being used in reference to them. The names used\r\nalso speak for themselves; as _mental_, the chin shield; _nasals_, near\r\nthe nostril; _rostral_, the beak shields.\r\n\r\nOphiologists in deciding species, etc., enumerate those which are more\r\nthan a pair as ‘upper labials’ so many, ‘lower labials’ so many. In\r\nsome snakes these shields are so large as to cover nearly the entire\r\nhead; in others, they are almost inconspicuously small, or absent\r\naltogether, and much varied, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nIn the vipers the head is generally covered with small, rigid,\r\nimbricated, or overlapping scales instead of plates, and in some\r\nthe scales are so extremely fine and closely arranged as almost\r\nto represent short bristles. This is noticeable in the African\r\n‘nose-horned viper’ (_Vipera nasicornis_), p. 322, where they present a\r\ncuriously complicated structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Magnified carinated scale.\r\n\r\nMagnified head-scale of _Vipera nasicornis_, of the\r\ncoloured illustration.]\r\n\r\nToo minute to examine except under the magnifying-glass, or to attempt\r\nto illustrate, we can convey only a general idea of these curious viper\r\nscales, which to the touch are spinous, and rough as a coarse brush.\r\nThey must form an unpleasant perch for a bird, if it be true that the\r\nlatter is enticed by the horns of some vipers to come and peck at them,\r\nas at a worm. These rigid head-scales become gradually larger and more\r\nsimple on the body, but are still comparatively small for so large a\r\nserpent. In some few of the viperine snakes, plates are present as\r\nwell as the fine scales, though chiefly about the nose and mouth,\r\nexceptions which are now and then found in non-venomous ones also.\r\nThe preceding three illustrations are the head shields of a Colubrine\r\nsnake, in which a greater uniformity prevails. Below are given four\r\nother types, though even here variations are constantly occurring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Fig. a._ One of the Indian _Crotalidæ_. It has two conspicuous\r\nsupraciliary shields, two equally conspicuous anterior frontals over\r\nthe nostril. The rest are small, and those on the top are absent\r\naltogether. The scales are all finely carinated.\r\n\r\n_Fig. b._ The head of a Colubrine snake in which the same scales appear\r\nas those in Fig. 1 of the preceding page, viz. two orbitals, etc., but\r\nare all much smaller, and do not therefore more than half cover the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n_Fig. c._ The head of a sea snake, which as to design is really pretty,\r\nand, as Günther affirms, so different from land snakes in respect to\r\nhead shields, that without any further investigation an ophiologist can\r\nat once distinguish the _hydrophidæ_.\r\n\r\n_Fig. d._ The head of a viper in which only very small supraciliary\r\nand nasal (or anterior frontal) shields are seen. The angular form of\r\nthe viperine head is here noteworthy. In some of the Tropical American\r\nviperine species (the _Crotalidæ_) the angular head is so marked as\r\nto be separated into a genus—the _Trigonocephali_, three-cornered\r\nheads. One head is sagittate or arrow-shaped to such an extent that the\r\nserpent is known as the _Fer de lance_, the dreaded _Trigonocephalus\r\nlanceolatus_ of the Antilles. There are _Trigonocephali_ among the\r\nIndian Thanatophidia also.\r\n\r\nOne other very remarkable exception must not be omitted—namely, that\r\nin pythons may be seen an angular head, which makes the neck thin and\r\nconspicuous, only in a less degree; and also the absence of large head\r\nshields. In addition to this, many of the pythons have particularly\r\nshort and very pointed tails—three singular viperine features in\r\nnon-venomous snakes, which can only be inherited from a common ancestry.\r\n\r\nAnother caprice is seen in the carinated or keel-shaped body scales,\r\nwhich are found in venomous and non-venomous, land and water, ground\r\nand tree snakes indifferently; though I think one may be safe in\r\naffirming that none of the true vipers have unkeeled and polished\r\nscales. Nicholson has observed that in several allied species, some\r\nhave and some have not the keel, and that those without do as well as\r\nthose with. ‘The history of the keel is not known,’ says this author.\r\nIn appearance it reminds one of the mid-rib of a leaf or of a feather,\r\nand may probably be an inherited feature in common with birds whose\r\nreptilian ancestry in process of ages had fluttered their scales into\r\nfeathers. In fact, in many snakes where no keel is found, there is\r\nsome slight indication of a centre line, even if it take the form of\r\na groove or depression. In the _Tropidonoti_ the keel is so developed\r\nas to distinguish the group; yet many with keels have comparatively\r\nsmooth skins. The carinated scales of vipers (from _carina_, a keel)\r\nare sharply defined, like the keel at the prow of a ship, or like the\r\nbreast-bone of the swift-flying birds which Mr. Sclater, in one of\r\nhis zoological lectures, described as the carinate birds. It is these\r\nsharply-defined, stiff; and dull scales belonging to the vipers which\r\nproduce the rustling noise when the snake is agitated, as described in\r\nthe little Indian _Echis carinata_ in the chapter on hissing. In the\r\n_Cerastes_ I have witnessed the same agitated convolutions accompanied\r\nby the audible rustling produced by the rough scales. See illus. p. 317.\r\n\r\nWhat are called ‘horns’ in some of the African vipers are\r\ncuriously-modified scales, which, under close examination, present the\r\nappearance of half-curled leaves, sometimes of ears, like those of a\r\nrabbit or a mouse. Being only cuticle, and liable to injury, these\r\n‘horns’ vary in size and colour as well as form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The sloughed horns of _Vipera nasicornis_ (exact size).]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying figure is from the slough of the _Vipera nasicornis_\r\nof the coloured illustration. They were not reversed in desquamation,\r\nbut came off with a portion of the fine spiny head scales. They were\r\nso dry and shrivelled at the time, that it is hard to conceive how\r\nthey could possibly be reversed, the rest of the bristly head-scales\r\npeeling off in pieces. Yet we cannot conclude from this that the horns\r\nare _never reversed_ in sloughing; the individual in question having\r\nundergone long captivity in a close box during her journey from West\r\nAfrica, and arriving at the Zoological Gardens in such a miserable\r\nplight that it was difficult to distinguish species or colouring for\r\nmany days. In this condition she remained for five weeks, when one fine\r\nSunday afternoon she presented the Society with forty-six viperlings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIPERA NASICORNIS AND YOUNG ONE.\r\n\r\nAFRICA.\r\n\r\nMother over five feet long, Viperling 9 inches.]\r\n\r\nSoon after this event she discarded her way-worn and bedraggled\r\ngarment, and shone resplendent in gorgeous colouring, as presented to\r\nthe reader in the coloured illustration.\r\n\r\nHer portrait was not taken until some weeks afterwards, when the horns\r\nwere therefore a little dry and shrivelled again. With the new dress\r\nthey presented a well-defined and perfect curve, tapering to a point,\r\nand without any break in their outline. By degrees they became curled\r\nin the manner here represented. Her colours were of a rich prismatic\r\nhue on the sides, where the brilliant tints are so blended that to\r\npaint them is impossible. Only on the back and in the darker markings\r\ncan the pattern be fairly represented. Her children all resembled her\r\nin their rich tints, and were so handsome that one almost forgot their\r\nevil propensities.\r\n\r\nForty of them died within a week. I begged hard for one of the\r\ndeceased. The keeper of course had no power in his hands. All were\r\nwanted for scientific experimentalists. Alas, I was no scientist, but\r\nonly a woman! The following Sunday, when I was at the Gardens, the\r\nforty-first baby viper had just died. The Superintendent ‘happened\r\nalong,’ and was greeted with another appeal from me. He would ‘consider\r\nof it’ and let me know ‘to-morrow.’ ‘Oh, why not _now_?’ pleaded the\r\nreader’s devoted servant. ‘You can’t want forty-one little dead vipers!’\r\n\r\nSuddenly to the rescue appeared on the scene no less a personage\r\nthan Dr. Günther, and to him I urged my request. ‘Well,’ said he in\r\nresponse to my eagerness, ‘one of Our Council is here, and’—Yes, the\r\nF.Z.S. referred to had, with the Superintendent, just passed the iron\r\nbarrier to view the interesting little survivors, and Dr. Günther\r\nfollowed, while I discreetly remained outside. My suspense was not of\r\nlong duration, for soon reappeared the amiable Superintendent daintily\r\ncarrying a little paper bag which might have contained bon-bons.\r\n‘Fortunately,’ said he, ‘two of Our Council happen to be here, and so,’\r\netc., and I became the happy possessor of the scarcely cold viperling,\r\nhere faithfully represented by the side of its mother. Exultantly I\r\ncarried it off to a sequestered spot,—thinking chiefly of _you_, dear\r\nreaders,—and examined its ‘horns,’ which wore the appearance of an\r\nornamental top-knot rather than horns. They were like a bow, or two\r\nlittle ears, or half-unfolded leaves. Its colouring was gorgeous, but\r\nthe pattern is too fine and complicated to represent on so small a\r\nscale. The black triangular mark on the head of both mother and child\r\nwas like velvet in its density. Nor was this appearance lessened\r\nunder the lens; for quickly I ran off with my treasure, and spent\r\na delightful ‘evening at home’ in studying its ‘points,’ not even\r\nexcepting those of tongue and fangs. The former is represented on p.\r\n120, and the latter on p. 360. The other results of my investigations\r\ncome under their separate heads in this book.\r\n\r\nAnother of the horned serpents, _Vipera cornuta_, has a cluster of\r\nleaf-like scales in three distinct pairs decorating its nose. These in\r\nthe individual at the Zoological Gardens were particularly ear-like,\r\nand there was a remarkable peculiarity about them which was not found\r\nin either of the other horned specimens when dead. It was, that when\r\none horn was moved divergently with the finger, its fellow moved\r\n_without being touched_ to correspond, and when let go _both_ sprang\r\nback to their original position. I at first was merely feeling and\r\nexamining them when this singularly sympathetic movement arrested my\r\nattention. Then I tried it with each of the six scales or ‘horns’\r\nseveral times, and always with the same result. Whichever one of them\r\nwas held back, the opposite one diverged at a corresponding angle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n1. Natural position.\r\n\r\n2. Three held back to their utmost.\r\n\r\n3. Three held back partly.]\r\n\r\nTheir natural position is nearly erect, and when one horn—say the\r\nlongest to the right in Fig. 1—was pressed or pulled outwards, we\r\nmight suppose that in a dead specimen it would drag its fellow that way\r\nalso, should any movement at all take place; instead of which, it flew\r\noff in the opposite direction, like two negative or two positive poles\r\nrepelling each other. If I pressed the three to the right as much as in\r\nthe centre figure, the other three receded similarly to the left. Each\r\npair acted in concert in this remarkable manner, or each two pairs, or\r\nall three pairs.\r\n\r\nThe three sketches are given merely in illustration of a phenomenon\r\nwhich I cannot attempt to explain or even to comprehend. They\r\nwere drawn from memory, and are not therefore offered as exact\r\nrepresentations, though near enough to serve our purpose. The movement\r\nseems to argue some peculiar muscular or nervous connection between\r\neach pair. The serpent had not been long dead; and as no others of\r\nthis species have since been at the Gardens, I cannot tell whether\r\nthe same sympathetic movement would be seen in the living viper. I\r\nhave attentively watched the horns of the other vipers, but never\r\ndetected the slightest voluntary action in them. Nor do the horns of\r\n_V. nasicornis_ respond to the touch in the same way. A third of the\r\nhorned vipers is the _Cerastes_ of classic times. Illustrators of books\r\nfrom descriptions only have presented us with this serpent adorned\r\nwith horns like a young heifer. They are simply scaly appendages like\r\nthe rest, but when perfect do certainly curve backwards and upwards\r\nin a rather bovine fashion. It happened that a _Cerastes_ was brought\r\nto the Gardens just after the six-horned viper had died, affording me\r\na happy opportunity of examining it. It was of this viper that Pliny\r\nwrote: ‘It moves its little horns, often 4 in number, to attract\r\nbirds, the rest of its body lying concealed.’ It is the habit of all\r\nthose inhabiting sandy deserts thus to hide themselves, probably to\r\nescape the scorching, drying sunshine, and with perhaps the nose and\r\nupper part of the head exposed for breathing. I have carefully watched\r\nseveral of the horned vipers for a long while together, but have never\r\ndetected the slightest volitional movement in their horns. A bird might\r\ncome and peck at them, nevertheless. Another belonging to South Africa\r\n(_Lophophrys_) has a bunch of irregular and much shorter horns standing\r\nerect and apparently unpaired. Incipient horny scales often accompany\r\nthe regular pairs, making it difficult to decide exactly which was\r\nPliny’s of the ‘four horns,’ and which is the _Hexacornis_ of Shaw.\r\nVarieties exist and add to the perplexity; probably also hybrids occur\r\namong these as among non-viperine snakes.\r\n\r\nA curious variety of the nasal appendages appears in the _Langaha_ with\r\nthe _crête de coq_; only the crest is on the snout instead of on the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThese spurs are merely modifications of the epidermis like the rest;\r\nbut are, no doubt, endowed with peculiar sensitiveness, so that\r\npossibly they act as a sort of herald in the dark, like a cat’s\r\nwhiskers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Profile of _Langaha_.]\r\n\r\nThere are the pointed-nosed Dryophidians also, with scaly\r\nprotuberances, and others with variously-elongated snouts terminating\r\nin long, scaly, horn-like appendages, all, no doubt, more or less\r\nsensitive, to enable the owners to feel their way, or ascertain the\r\nnature of their surroundings, especially if they are of nocturnal\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nIn some of the tree snakes, notably _Passerita_, there is no appendage,\r\nbut the long snout is itself endowed with mobility. This is a nocturnal\r\nsnake; a harmless and exceedingly slender, graceful creature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Profile of _Passerita_.]\r\n\r\nBut of these curious developments or prolongations, one of the Indian\r\nfresh-water snakes presents a remarkable example, almost allying\r\nit to some of the fishes with long tentacular appendages. _Herpeton\r\ntentaculum_ is its name, its pair of tentacles being scaly and\r\nflexible, and in appearance somewhat like the African viper’s horns,\r\nsticking out horizontally from its snout. They are employed under water\r\nas organs of touch, and probably to discern food.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the most striking head-appendages; though in the way\r\nof pug-nosed ophidians and curious profiles we might give a whole page\r\nof illustrations.\r\n\r\nIn the acrobatic chapter, mention was made of a pair of rudimentary\r\nhind limbs in some of the boas. Externally the derm is condensed into\r\n‘claws’ or ‘hooks.’ In form they are merely long, simple appendages,\r\nwhich in the largest boas are about as big as a finger. Claws and hooks\r\nthey are in the matter of use, being a pair, and they no doubt assist\r\nthe climbing snakes in grasping.\r\n\r\nAs a condensed form of the tegument, they are included in this chapter;\r\nbut as they are truly vestiges of limbs, I will digress a moment to add\r\na word.\r\n\r\nSays Darwin on rudimentary and atrophied limbs: ‘The disuse of parts\r\nleads to their reduced size: and the result is inherited.’ Some tame\r\nlittle lizards in my possession—our native species—when crawling\r\nabout their cages scratching the sand or pushing their way among the\r\nmoss and rubbish, frequently made use of their fore legs only, allowing\r\nthe hind legs to drag after them, not because the latter were in any\r\nway injured, but simply because the lizards could do well enough\r\nwithout them. They were folded back or permitted to lie passively\r\nprone against the tail, while the arms and exquisite little hands were\r\nsufficient for the work required. They reminded one of Darwin’s words,\r\nand though my style of talking to my pets was such as to suit lizard\r\ncomprehension solely, I did sometimes warn them in plain English. ‘If\r\nyou don’t give your legs sufficient exercise, they will dwindle away by\r\nand by, and your descendants will have no hind legs at all!’\r\n\r\nAfter thus moralizing to the unheeding lacertines, it was with secret\r\ngratification that one heard Professor Huxley, in his Lecture on\r\n‘Snakes’ at the London Institution, Dec. 1, 1879, say—as nearly as I\r\ncan remember—‘In evolution or a gradual change, the lizard found it\r\nprofitable to lose its legs and become a snake; all modifications are\r\nan improvement to the creature, putting it in a better condition.’ In\r\nthis ‘better condition,’ therefore, does the slow-worm find itself,\r\nwhen it glides noiselessly, and almost without stirring a blade of\r\ngrass, into its burrow. In other lizards one may sometimes observe\r\nthat the _hind_ legs are most used in scratching and pushing the earth\r\naway. Thus, in the constricting snakes—these descendants of some\r\npre-ophidian lizards—the unused limbs have become obsolete; and the\r\nspine, gaining strength with increased action, has at length become to\r\nthe constrictors their hands, feet, arms, and legs, and endowed with\r\nthose wondrous capabilities which were described in chap. xii.\r\n\r\nTo return to the integument. As one of its developments, the hood of\r\nthe cobra may be included in this chapter, the skin here exhibiting\r\nits extensile or expansive construction. It is the longer ribs, about\r\ntwenty pairs nearest the head (see p. 33), which really do form\r\nthe hood. These anterior ribs, gradually increasing in length and\r\ndecreasing again, are not connected with the ventral scales in the\r\nsame way as those on which the snake progresses, but can be elevated\r\nor expanded in the manner familiar to the reader; they then support\r\nthe extended skin exactly in the way that the ribs of a lined parasol\r\nsupport the fabric; only while the ribs of the parasol spring from a\r\ncommon centre, the ribs of the cobra are attached to its vertebræ,\r\nrequiring no other agency than the will of the owner. The action of\r\nthe ribs as expressive of emotion, in several species of snakes, was\r\nmentioned page 150. In the ‘hooded’ snakes (_naja_), it is seen in an\r\nextreme degree. Facing you, the angry cobra displays these umbra-like\r\nexpanded ribs, while the form of the ‘neck’ or vertebral column in the\r\ncentre is prominently perceptible. When at rest, they all lie flat one\r\nover the other, like the ribs of a closed parasol.\r\n\r\nIn the way of external peculiarities the ‘gular fissure’ may be\r\nmentioned. It is merely a slight groove or crease extending from\r\nthe chin longitudinally under the throat for a few inches or more,\r\naccording to the size of the snake; a sort of wrinkle (_fosse_) to\r\nadmit of expansion during the swallowing of prey.\r\n\r\nExternally snakes have no indication of ears; therefore, in the way of\r\nintegument, there is nothing to describe in their organ of hearing. But\r\nthe eye covering is a beautiful and wonderful arrangement.\r\n\r\nSnakes have no eyelids, and can therefore never close their eyes, a\r\nfact which has given rise to a vulgar belief that they never sleep.\r\nTheir eyes are, however, well developed, particularly in those\r\nsnakes which live above ground, and are covered with a transparent\r\nlayer of the epidermis, forming a capsule which is moulted with\r\nthe cuticle. Physiologists tell us that it is moistened with the\r\nlachrymal fluid. Bright and glistening is the serpent’s eye, except\r\nprevious to desquamation, when, from the new skin forming beneath, it\r\nbecomes opaque and dull, and the snake is blind for a few days more or\r\nless, according to its health at the time. Rymer Jones considers the\r\ntransparent membrane cast with the slough a real eyelid in a framework\r\nof regular scales; Huxley (in the lecture already alluded to) said\r\nsnakes’ eyelids are as if our two eyelids were joined. In form and\r\nappearance this moulted cuticle is singularly clear and shapely: on the\r\nouter side, like a miniature watchglass; but within it is a perfect\r\ncup, standing up and out from the surrounding scales like a cup in a\r\nsaucer, the rounded base of which is the transparent skin, as here seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Illustration of eye covering.]\r\n\r\nFor the process of sloughing or casting the skin, the term\r\ndesquamation—literally, an unscaling—is often used; but this word\r\nseems rather to imply an unhealthy action, as if the cuticle peels off\r\nin pieces, than the normal operation, which is to shed it entire.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of surprise—if we are to believe what we read—that\r\nfew naturalists seem to have witnessed this process, so as to be able\r\nto describe it from their own observations; but this must be due more\r\nto lack of interest than of opportunity, since the occurrence is very\r\nfrequent. Those in the vicinity of Zoological Gardens have no excuse\r\nfor not observing it; yet so lately as Oct. 1879, we find a writer in\r\n_Nature_, vol. xx. p. 530, attempting to describe the ‘skin-shedding,’\r\nwith the admission that he has never witnessed the process, nor, he\r\nbelieves, ‘has any observer’! He thinks snakes shed the skin ‘as if you\r\nturned a narrow hem, or a glove-finger by a knotted thread fastened at\r\nthe tip,’ and which of course would draw the tip _inside_ the finger.\r\nThe glove tip is to represent the tail of the snake, which, as he\r\nsupposes, adhering _at the tip_, is drawn along _inwards_ as the snake\r\nproceeds to crawl out of its own mouth, or its cuticle’s mouth—which\r\nhas already become loosened round the lips. This, in the mind of that\r\nwriter, satisfactorily accounts for the skin being usually found\r\nreversed! Can he have never seen a silkworm change its skin; or found\r\nthe slough of a common caterpillar adhering to its tail; or observed\r\nthe appearance of its mouth previous to the moulting? True, a slow-worm\r\nsometimes leaves its slough in a crumpled-up condition, exactly like\r\nthe silk-worm’s. This I have seen. On the other hand, the same little\r\nreptile, on another occasion, crawled out of its coat, leaving it\r\nperfect and unreversed through its entire length. Both sloughs have\r\nbeen preserved. As a more general rule the slough is reversed; but in\r\nthe process it folds back and over the body, _outside_ of it, in the\r\nmanner of a stocking drawn off from knee-wards, and turning back till\r\nentirely reversed it leaves the foot. This common and apt illustration\r\nis easily understood if we suppose the top of the stocking to be the\r\nmouth of the slough, and the toe its tail. But as the toes might\r\nsometimes slip out of a stocking when nearly off, so does the tail\r\nof a snake sometimes slip out; this portion therefore is often found\r\n_unreversed_. More than a hundred years ago the sloughing of snakes was\r\nunderstood and described in the _Phil. Trans._ for 1747, vol. xl.; as\r\nalso of lizards ‘slipping off their skins as vipers do.’ Some young\r\nvipers changed at six weeks old, and again in two months after that.\r\n‘They always began at the mouth,’ said the writer. The process has been\r\nwitnessed and described by many since that, though more by foreign than\r\nby English naturalists.\r\n\r\nSome of the older writers have told us that ‘a snake frequents the spot\r\nwhere it has cast its skin,’ or, in other words, that it selects that\r\nlocality for its nest—a fact as curiously stated as if you related of\r\na person that he chose for his home the house in which he performed his\r\ntoilet. Snakes have a strong affection for locality; and where their\r\nnest is, there, or near it, their garments are naturally renewed.\r\n\r\nAnother mooted question has been the precise period of sloughing;\r\nformerly the accepted opinion was that once a year, viz. in the spring,\r\nwas the usual habit. This was probably from so many coils of skins\r\nbeing found at this season. That they do change in the spring may\r\nbe established as an almost invariable rule; but not then only. No\r\nprecise periods can be given with certainty, because it depends on the\r\nindividual, its health and surroundings. The ophidian is a fastidious\r\ncreature, and when his garment becomes soiled or uncomfortable he\r\ndiscards it. Thus after hibernation, when for some months numbers\r\nof snakes have been coiled in masses in a cave or under stones\r\nand rubbish, and they emerge into daylight, aroused by the sun’s\r\nrevivifying rays, what more natural than to cast off the old winter\r\ngarb for a more comfortable suit?\r\n\r\nAlmost invariably, soon after a long journey, and on being established\r\nin a new home, a snake re-attires. We have seen what their travelling\r\ncages are! Closely nailed up, and often in air-tight boxes in which the\r\npoor things are tumbled over and over with as little mercy as ceremony\r\nduring removal from one conveyance to another, they arrive—as in the\r\ncase of the African viper (coloured illustration)—in such a pitiable\r\nplight that it is next to impossible to identify them. Another almost\r\ninvariable rule is sloughing soon after birth—that is, in from a\r\nweek to a fortnight; also, during early and rapid growth, the young\r\nsnake will change frequently. Most ophiologists fix upon two months\r\nas an average time, taking one snake with another; for while one may\r\ndesquamate every few weeks, another may keep his coat unsoiled for six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Fayrer made careful notes on this subject. He had one cobra\r\nwhich changed in rather less than a month—viz. first on Oct. 17th,\r\nnext on Nov. 10th, and again on Dec. 7th. A _Liophis_ at the London\r\nGardens changed every few weeks, and a _Ptyas_—he of the lecture\r\nexhibition (p. 214)—changed almost once a month on an average.\r\n\r\nA curiously beautiful object is the cast-off coat, and well worth\r\nan examination. You discern the exact form of the reptile’s head,\r\nmouth, and nostrils, the exquisitely transparent eye-covering, the\r\nvarious forms of the overlapping or imbricated folds or ‘scales,’ and\r\nhow admirably the broad ventral plates are adapted for locomotion;\r\nparticularly noteworthy too is the perfect reversion of this coat of\r\nsome feet or some yards in length, turned inside out as you may turn a\r\nsleeve.\r\n\r\nThe first time I watched the process was with the celebrated Hamadryad\r\nsoon after it was installed as a distinguished inmate at the Zoological\r\nGardens. The interest attached to this _Ophiophagus_ or snake-eater had\r\ncaused me to observe it on all possible occasions; and as the whole\r\nfront of its cage was clear glass at that time, the spectator could\r\neasily see all that occurred within.\r\n\r\nWill the reader once more accompany me in imagination to the Gardens,\r\nand see how a snake performs its toilet? I have watched many since\r\nthen, and have observed the same proceeding in them all, those in\r\ngood health and able to assist themselves; in others it is a literal\r\ndesquamation or peeling off of scales or fragments in a dry state.\r\nEncouraged by the very recent statement in a highly scientific journal,\r\nthat no one is supposed ever to have witnessed the sloughing of snakes,\r\nI venture to again describe what I saw, having already done so in\r\nthe _Dublin University Magazine_ in Dec. 1875, and in _Aunt Judy’s\r\nMagazine_ (Sept. 1874), and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe stand before the cage of the interesting Hamadryad (_Ophiophagus\r\nelaps_). His name at once tells us that he is fond of trees as well\r\nas of snakes; but, alas! there is no tree in his cage, not even an\r\nold bough on which to exercise his climbing propensities. He is\r\nwonderfully restless to-day, crawling ceaselessly about as if in\r\nsearch of something. This, however, cannot be his object; for his head\r\nis not raised in observation, but is close to the shingle, as if too\r\nheavy to lift. He seems to be pushing it before him in a very strange\r\nmanner, and is evidently suffering discomfort of some sort. All round\r\nhis cage he goes, against the edge of the tank, still pushing and\r\nrubbing his head, now under his blanket, or against any projecting\r\nsurface, under again, close to the floor, restlessly on and on in these\r\nuntiring perambulations; what can be the cause? After a tedious while\r\n‘Ophio’—as his admirers call him—varies his movements, but only to\r\nturn the chin upwards and push his head sideways over the shingle.\r\nNow the other side he pushes along: the action is like that of a cat\r\nrubbing her head against your chair. Now he turns his head completely\r\nover, so that the top of it may come in for its share of rubbing;\r\nand such for a considerable time are his persistent movements, while\r\nwe watch him wonderingly, and at length point him out to the keeper\r\ninquiringly.\r\n\r\n‘Going to change,’ said Holland. ‘That’s the way they always do.’\r\n\r\nTo you and me, dear reader, the sight is novel and interesting; so let\r\nus continue to watch, glad that nothing more serious is the matter with\r\nthis rare and valuable snake than doffing an old coat.\r\n\r\nAnd soon we see the skin separating at the lips, where, no doubt, it\r\nhas caused irritation and induced that incessant rubbing. Now the\r\nentire upper lip is free, and the loose portion laps back as Ophio\r\npursues his course. Next we see the skin of the under lip detaching\r\nitself; and that is also reversed, the two portions above and below\r\nthe jaw increasing every moment and folding farther and farther back\r\nwith the ceaseless friction until they look like a cape or hood round\r\nOphio’s neck, from which his clean bright head emerges. Hitherto the\r\nprocess has been tedious, but now the ribs are reached, and they take\r\npart in the work and facilitate matters greatly. The snake has no\r\nlonger to rub himself so vigorously, but simply to keep moving; and at\r\nevery step, so to speak—that is, with every pair of ribs in succession\r\nbeginning at the neck—the large ventral scale belonging to that pair\r\nis shoved off, carrying with it the complete circle of scales. With an\r\nalmost imperceptible nudge each pair of ribs eases off a portion, which\r\ncontinually lengthening as it is vacated, and reversed of course, folds\r\nback more and more, till Ophio looks as if he were crawling out of a\r\nsilken tube. As he thus proceeds, now very rapidly, he emerges bright\r\nand beautiful—six inches, a foot, two feet; and all the while each\r\npair of ribs successively performs its part with that nudging sort of\r\naction, like elbowing off a coat sleeve. If we had begun to count from\r\nthe very first pair, and if he had not gone under his blanket during\r\nthe process, we could have told the precise number of pairs of ribs\r\nwhich he has to assist his toilet. He had two yards and a half of old\r\ncoat to walk out of, but this he achieves in far less time than it\r\ntook him to get his head clear. In his native tree or jungle he would\r\nhave found leaves and underbrush to aid the operation; and it would\r\nbe a great kindness to snakes in captivity to provide them with wisps\r\nof straw, when sloughing, or some rough rubbish in their cages. Soft\r\nblankets and smooth wood-work do not offer sufficient resistance for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe constricting snakes are less at a loss. From their pliancy of\r\nmotion, and their habits of coiling—from the fact of their ‘whole body\r\nbeing a hand,’ as we have already seen, they can assist themselves by\r\ntheir own coils passing through them, and so helping to drag off the\r\nslough.\r\n\r\nThose who have kept snakes tell us that the tame ones will even leave\r\nthe slough in the hand, if you hold them during the process, and permit\r\nthem to pass gently through the closed fingers. Owen, in his _Anatomy\r\nof the Vertebrates_, mentions as a not unfrequent action, that when the\r\nhead is free from the slough the snake brings forward the tail, and\r\ncoils it transversely round the head, then pushes itself through the\r\ncoil, threading its body through this caudal ring.\r\n\r\nBut we have left our captive with still about a foot and a half of\r\ngarment to get rid of and this is not much less difficult to accomplish\r\nthan the head-gear. He has arrived at the last pair of ribs, and\r\nnow, without such agency to free the tail cuticle, he more than ever\r\nneeds some opposing obstacle. He has only his blanket, however, to\r\npass under; and at last, by dragging himself along, the process is\r\ncompleted, the extreme few inches sliding off unreversed.\r\n\r\nOn several subsequent occasions the Hamadryad has left the entire\r\ntail, often _nearly_ all of it, unreversed, as do many other snakes.\r\nSometimes by a succession of jerks they manage to get rid of this\r\nportion; sometimes a comrade happens to pass over the slough—a great\r\nassistance, as affording resistance. I observed this particularly in\r\na small constrictor, one of the three that entrapped two or three\r\nsparrows in as many coils at the same moment. In this case the whole\r\nprocess occupied less than ten minutes. After rubbing its head against\r\nthe gravel, and turning it completely over to free itself from\r\nthe upper shields, its ribs took chief part as usual, and I noted\r\nparticularly that each pair moved in concert, and not alternately. This\r\nlittle snake went round close under the slanting edge of his bath-pan,\r\nwhich afforded him some assistance, and by the time he reappeared in\r\nfront the whole slough was discarded, excepting a few inches of tail.\r\nThese few inches caused some trouble, until his friend the python\r\nhappened to pass over it, when with one final jerk the slough was free\r\nand entire from lip to tip. It was the quickest and most complete\r\nsloughing I have ever watched.\r\n\r\nWhen all was over, the large, beautiful black eyes of this four-striped\r\nor ‘four-rayed’ snake were particularly brilliant, as the little\r\nconstrictor looked about and watched observantly, rejoicing in his\r\nnewly-found faculty, after the blindness of the preceding days. Often\r\nthe snakes are shy, and change at night; the tamer ones, however,\r\nundress when it suits them, affording frequent opportunities for\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThe slough when first discarded is moist and flabby; but it soon dries,\r\nand then in substance is as much like what is called ‘gold-beater’s\r\nskin’ as anything else, though a stronger texture is observable in the\r\nhead-shields and the ventral scales.\r\n\r\nThe size of the scales does not appear to bear any very regular\r\ncorrespondence with the size of their owner; for you will notice that\r\nsome snakes only three feet in length, have larger scales than others\r\nthree yards in length. Some of the immense pythons have smaller scales\r\nthan a rattlesnake; and again, snakes of similar dimensions have scales\r\ndifferent both in size and form. As great a variety is seen in the form\r\nand arrangement of scales as of shields.\r\n\r\nSnakes are to a certain extent invalids previous to the shedding of\r\ntheir skin, temporarily blind, courting retirement, and declining food;\r\nbut they recover triumphantly the moment the slough is discarded.\r\nThey then appear to rejoice in a new existence, their functions are in\r\nfullest activity, their appetite keen. At this time the poisonous kinds\r\nare most to be dreaded, probably from the venom having accumulated\r\nduring the quiescent condition.\r\n\r\nAt this time, too, their colours show to the greatest advantage, their\r\neyes are brightest, and their personal comfort no doubt is enhanced in\r\nevery way.\r\n\r\nBefore taking leave of the integument, a few words about the markings\r\nor patterns and colouring of serpents may not come amiss. Mr. Ruskin,\r\nin his celebrated lecture on Snakes, exhibited to his delighted\r\naudience a fine anaconda skin, and drew attention to the ‘disorderly\r\nspots, without system,’ with which this snake is marked. _Taches à\r\ntortue_, as it was at first described; and by Dumeril as marked ‘_avec\r\nde grandes taches semées sans ordre_.’ Notwithstanding the irregularity\r\nthe skin is handsome. The oval spots of various sizes and at unequal\r\ndistances have still a character of their own, as much as the spots of\r\nthe leopard or the stripes of the zebra, no two of which are placed\r\nwith mathematical precision. Mr. Ruskin had but few kind words to\r\nbestow on ophidian reptiles, but the disorderly patterns of their coats\r\nhe greatly disapproved. Moreover, the great artist was inclined to\r\npronounce a sweeping verdict on the conspicuous ‘ugliness of the whole\r\n_poisonous_ families’ without exception.\r\n\r\nNow unfortunately we have had occasion to lament the good looks of many\r\nvenomous kinds which are easily mistaken for harmless snakes. Some\r\nof the American _elapidæ_ are amongst the most beautiful, with their\r\nblack, white, and crimson rings. The African viper and her young one\r\nbaffle the artist’s palette in their prismatic hues, as do several\r\nother of the horned snakes. Indeed, for rich colourings the venomous\r\nkinds rather carry the day. The _form_, it is true, is often clumsy\r\nand ungraceful in the vipers, but as an exception we have ‘_vipera\r\nelegans_,’ and others of less ugly and slighter forms.\r\n\r\nSince the subject was thus presented to us, I have, however, observed\r\nthe markings more closely; and it really is curious as well as\r\ninteresting to note how very nearly the various patterns approach to a\r\nperfectly geometrical design, yet failing in the same manner that a bad\r\nworkman would fail in imitating the pattern given him to copy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of design.]\r\n\r\nTo Dr. Stradling I am indebted for a very handsome boa skin from\r\nBrazil. Spread upon the carpet it is like a piece of oilcloth, and at\r\nthe first glance I exclaimed, ‘Even Mr. Ruskin could not disapprove of\r\nthis.’ But on closer inspection one was obliged to admit ‘disorder’\r\nthroughout. The skin is about ten feet long, and the whole way down the\r\ncentre of the back runs a pattern which an accomplished artificer would\r\nthus represent. There is evident intention of two straight lines with\r\npoints at equal distances, a very pretty centre of rich brown, picked\r\nout with darker shades and spots of white. Throughout the entire ten\r\nfeet of skin most of the points and intermediate centres had a splash\r\nor spot of white, and most of the points were opposite, but no two feet\r\nconsecutively could I find with better finished markings than this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Exact pattern with the lateral spots.]\r\n\r\nThe outer spots also were evidently of triangular intentions, and\r\nfor the most part occupying the spaces midway between the points.\r\nThese, of lighter tints, also run the whole length of the snake, the\r\npattern of course diminishing with the size tailwards, but varying in\r\nno other way. The question is not whether the strictly geometrical or\r\nthe less perfect design would be the handsomer, or we might give the\r\npreference to the pattern as we find it; but looking closely at any\r\nelaborately-marked snake, it certainly _is_ curious to perceive that\r\nin every case there is this same attempt at something too difficult to\r\naccomplish, as when a novice in fancy-work does her stitches wrong.\r\nThe same thing is seen in the snakes of the frontispiece, and the same\r\nis seen again even in this simple pattern, a chain running down the\r\nback of little _Echis carinata_. The spaces are unequal, the black\r\ncross bands imperfect, and the centre spots some round, some oval, some\r\nalmost absent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pattern of a snake.]\r\n\r\nMay we conclude that this incompleteness is a sign that the design is\r\nnot fixed by long inheritance? But if it were so, and presented to us\r\nwith geometrical precision, it is doubtful whether we could admire it\r\nequally!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n_DENTITION._\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the preceding pages it may have been observed that the adage, ‘There\r\nare no rules without exceptions,’ occurs so frequently in ophidian\r\nphysiology that the latter are almost in the majority. Concerning the\r\nteeth especially, the forms of dentition in the various families, the\r\ndistinction of species by them, the size and position of poison fangs,\r\netc., the rules involve so many exceptions that we can perhaps render\r\nthe subject less perplexing by dispensing with rules altogether. ‘The\r\ngradations of teeth are very imperceptible,’ said Prof. Huxley in\r\nhis lecture at the London Institution. So numerous are their stages\r\nof development that there is really no well-defined gap between the\r\nvenomous and the non-venomous species. ‘We do not know for certain\r\nwhether the ordinary teeth are poisonous or not,’ Huxley also said.\r\nThe recent researches into the nature of salivary secretions will\r\nthrow more light on this subject. A large non-venomous snake, like\r\nother normally harmless animals, if biting angrily, with its abundant\r\nsalivary glands pouring secretions into its mouth, might inflict a\r\nvery ugly wound, especially on a feeble or frightened victim.\r\n\r\nA few rules may, however, safely be offered as ‘without exception,’ and\r\nthese I will point out in order to clear the way a little towards a\r\nbetter comprehension of the exceptional ones.\r\n\r\nAll true snakes, poisonous or not, that have teeth at all, have the six\r\njaws described in the first chapter, viz. the right and left upper jaw,\r\nthe right and left lower jaw, and the right and left palate jaw. The\r\nlatter are called ‘jaws,’ not anatomically, but merely as answering the\r\nsame purpose, being furnished with teeth; each true jaw and the palate\r\nbeing considered as two or a pair, on account of the independent action\r\nimparted to each by the especial muscles and the elastic tissue which\r\nunites them, where in the higher animals they are consolidated.\r\n\r\nWith but one exception (the _egg-eating Oligodon_ or _Anodon_ family)\r\nall other true serpents, whether venomous or not, possess the two rows\r\nof palate teeth.\r\n\r\nAll can move or use each of the six jaws, or any two, three, or more of\r\nthem independently, as we observed in feeding, some of the six holding\r\nthe prey while others move on. Some writers have conveyed the idea\r\nthat there is a regular alternation and even rotation of the jaws in\r\nfeeding, No. 1, 2, and so on in succession till all the six have moved,\r\nand then No. 1 in its turn again; but observation inclines me rather\r\nto decide that there is no other rule than the feeder’s individual\r\nconvenience, according to what its teeth may be grasping, any more than\r\nthere is in other creatures that without reflection or intent, and not\r\nstrictly in turn, eat now on one side of the mouth and now on the\r\nother (except in the case of some poor mortal with the toothache, when,\r\nhaving only the two jaws, his distressful efforts are chiefly directed\r\ntowards relieving that side of its ordinary duties). Snakes, for aught\r\nwe know, may have the toothache: loose teeth they frequently have; they\r\nsuffer from gum and mouth affections too, and no doubt can at such\r\ntimes relieve a whole jaw of its work.\r\n\r\nIn all true snakes the teeth are long, conical, and curved: not planted\r\nperpendicularly, but directed backwards; these long, fine, claw-shaped\r\ninstruments presenting a formidable obstacle against the retreat of a\r\ncreature once seized by them. Their arrangement is a species of trap,\r\nlike the wires of a mouse-trap: to enter being easy enough, but to\r\nescape against the spikes being impossible.\r\n\r\nAll snakes renew their teeth throughout life. Except fishes, therefore,\r\nno creatures are so abundantly supplied with teeth as are the Ophidia.\r\n\r\nOn account of this continual loss and replacement of teeth, the number\r\nis rarely so fixed and determinate as to be characteristic of the\r\nspecies. Probably no two snakes, not even brothers and sisters of the\r\nsame brood, may possess precisely the same number of teeth at a given\r\nage; because they are so easily loosened and lost, that the normal\r\nnumber might rarely occur in all the members of the same family at the\r\nsame time. In the scientific language of Rymer Jones, ‘the facility for\r\ndeveloping new tooth germs is unlimited, and the phenomena of dental\r\ndecadence and replacement are manifested in every period of life.’\r\n\r\nSays Nicholson, ‘The teeth are replaced not merely when accident has\r\nbroken off the old ones, but they are all shed at more or less regular\r\nintervals, coinciding with the casting of the epidermis.’ Not on _each\r\noccasion_ of sloughing, as we may, I think, understand this, but, like\r\nthe casting of cuticle, contingently, according to the condition of the\r\nindividual. Not altogether, either, or at certain periods of life, as\r\na child loses his first teeth and gets a second crop, or as an adult\r\ncuts his wisdom teeth, but ‘a crop of young teeth work their way into\r\nthe intervals of the old teeth, and gradually expel these latter.’ All\r\nthe spaces and depressions between the maxillary and palatine rows are\r\noccupied by the matrix of tooth germs. Not a cut can be made in this\r\npart of the palate without the knife turning up a number of young teeth\r\nin every stage of development.[92]\r\n\r\nIndependently of this accidental number, the maxillary presents certain\r\nphases which characterize families. For instance, a true viperine snake\r\nhas in the upper jaw fangs _only_: non-venomous snakes have a whole row\r\nof from fifteen to twenty-five maxillary teeth, and in intermediate\r\nspecies their normal numbers vary considerably. Some of the highly\r\npoisonous families, notably the cobras and the sea snakes, have a few\r\nsimple teeth in addition to fangs. The length of the jaw, therefore,\r\ndiminishes in proportion to the number of teeth it bears. Only the\r\nviperine snakes are limited to the poison fang in the upper jaw; but\r\nfangs, like the simple teeth, are shed, broken, or lost, and renewed\r\ncontinually.\r\n\r\nBehind the one in use—the functional fang—others in various stages of\r\ndevelopment are found—‘a perfect storehouse of new fangs,’ as Mr. F.\r\nBuckland in his facetious style called them; ‘lying one behind another\r\nlike a row of pandean pipes.’ In the skeletons of viperine snakes these\r\nmay readily be observed. In the living example they are enclosed in a\r\ncapsule, hidden by the loose gum sheath, called a gingeval envelope. So\r\nwhen the functional fang meets with an accident, or falls out in the\r\norder of things, the supplementary fangs in turn supply its place, each\r\nbecoming in time firmly fixed to the jaw-bone, and ready to perform the\r\noffice of its predecessor.\r\n\r\nPoison fangs succeed each other from behind, _forwards_; the simple\r\nteeth from the inner side, _outwards_.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further, it may be well to explain that what is\r\nmeant by the _true_ snakes in the foregoing rules, are those which do\r\nnot possess the lizard features; _Anguis fragilis_, and some of the\r\nburrowing snakes which approach the lizards, not having the palate\r\nteeth. But here again we are tripped up with exceptions, since we are\r\ntold that in dentition the boas are allied to the lizards; yet they\r\nhave palate teeth.\r\n\r\nThe importance of dentition in distinguishing snakes is seen in the\r\nnames assigned to them from their teeth alone. In giving a few of these\r\nterms we enable the reader to perceive at once, not only how very\r\nvaried are the systems of dentition, but in what way they vary, the\r\nwords themselves conveying the description.\r\n\r\nThe names here given are without reference to venomous or non-venomous\r\nserpents, but only as belonging to certain families whose teeth present\r\ncharacteristics sufficiently marked to be named by them.\r\n\r\nFrom _odous_, _odontos_, a tooth.\r\n\r\n  Anodon,     Toothless.\r\n  Boodon,     Ox tooth.\r\n  Cynodon,    Dog’s tooth.\r\n  Deirodon,   Neck tooth.\r\n  Dinodon,    Double tooth.\r\n  Glyphodon,  Grooved or carved tooth.\r\n  Heterodon,  Abnormal tooth.\r\n  Isodon,     Equal toothed.\r\n  Lycodon,    Wolf’s tooth.\r\n  Ogmodon,    Furrowed or grooved tooth.\r\n  Oligodon,   Few toothed.\r\n  Rachiodon,  Spine toothed.\r\n  Sepedon,    Noxious tooth, or a tooth causing putridity.\r\n  Tomodon,    Stump tooth.\r\n  Xenodon,    Strange tooth.\r\n\r\nIn Dumeril’s system very many families, including sometimes several of\r\nthe above, are grouped according to their teeth, thus:—\r\n\r\n      _Aglyphodontes_,   Teeth not carved or notched.\r\n      _Holodontes_,      Whole or entire teeth.\r\n      _Anholodontes_,    Without whole or entire teeth.\r\n      _Aproterodontes_,  Without front teeth.\r\n      _Isodontiens_,     With even teeth.\r\n      _Apistoglyphes_,   Grooved at the back, or the back teeth grooved.\r\n      _Proteroglyphes_,  Grooved in front, or the front teeth grooved.\r\n      _Solenoglyphes_,   Cut or carved with a canal.\r\n  And some others whose names are equally descriptive.\r\n\r\nThese various characters, with the exception of _Aproterodontes_, which\r\nrefers to the under jaw, have reference to the upper jaw only. It might\r\nbe tedious to the reader to enter into a minute description of each of\r\nthe above groups: sufficient for our present purpose is it to show that\r\nsuch varieties exist, and that a simple, even row of teeth, as a family\r\ndistinction, is oftener the exception than the rule. Some of the teeth\r\nincrease in size posteriorly, others are largest anteriorly; others,\r\nagain, are larger towards the middle of the jaw, and decrease at either\r\nend. Some harmless snakes have ‘fangs,’ that is to say, fang-like\r\nteeth, but not connected with any poison gland, and at the back\r\ninstead of the front of the jaw. Again, there are some non-venomous\r\nspecies that have the power of moving these fang-like teeth, raising\r\nor depressing them as vipers move their fangs, and as will be further\r\ndescribed presently. Some grooved teeth convey an acrid saliva, others\r\nare without any modification of saliva, the long teeth being of use in\r\nholding thick-skinned prey.\r\n\r\nThus we find every gradation both in number and in form until we come\r\nto the true fang, the ‘murderous tooth’ of the terrible cobra, the\r\n_hydrophidæ_, and the _viperidæ_. And noteworthy it is that the fewer\r\nthe teeth in the maxillary bone the more terrible are they. Fig. A of\r\nthe four illustrations given opposite is the jaw-bone of the Indian\r\nRat snake, _Ptyas mucosus_, already ‘honourably mentioned’ in these\r\npages. The illustration being taken from Fayrer’s _Thanatophidia_,\r\nmay be received as a faithful representation. This conveys a good\r\nidea of jaws generally in non-venomous snakes of that size, say from\r\nsix to ten feet long. In some of the smaller kinds the jaw and palate\r\nteeth are so fine as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. To\r\nthe touch they feel like points of the finest pins. Draw your finger\r\nalong or press it against a row of ‘minikin pins,’ and you will form a\r\ncorrect idea of these tiny weapons. I have often _felt_ when I could\r\nnot _see_ them in the mouth of a small harmless snake. Pass the tip of\r\nyour little finger gently along them towards the throat, and they are\r\nalmost imperceptible even to the touch; but in withdrawing your finger\r\n_against_ the points, you feel how excessively fine they are.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustrations are from nature, and exemplify the\r\nvarious lengths of jaw in four snakes, not differing very greatly in\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Four jaws. From Fayrer’s _Thanatophidia of India_.]\r\n\r\n_Fig. A._ _Ptyas mucosus_, with simple teeth only. That they are not\r\nvery regular is probably owing to the stages of growth in those that\r\nhave replaced others.\r\n\r\n_Fig. B._ A venomous snake, _Bungarus_, the ‘Krait,’ with a fixed fang\r\nin front and a few simple teeth behind it.\r\n\r\n_Fig. C._ Jaw of the cobra, with a longer fixed fang, and one or two\r\nsimple teeth behind it.\r\n\r\n_Fig. D._ The shortest jaw of them all, that of the Indian viper\r\n_Daboia_, in which the maxillary is reduced to a mere wedge of\r\nbone. These, with four or five reserve fangs, are here folded back\r\n‘depressed.’ A few palate teeth are also seen.\r\n\r\nHaving given a slight sketch of the various forms of dentition, and\r\narrived at ‘fangs,’ we may recapitulate, in what Nicholson calls\r\n‘roughly speaking,’ four stages of development in these latter.\r\n\r\n_First_, the ‘fangs’ of the harmless snakes, such as _Lycodon_,\r\n_Xenodon_, _Heterodon_, etc., which have no poison gland, but whose\r\nsaliva may be slightly and occasionally injurious.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, those having a salivary gland secreting poison and a\r\ngrooved fang in front of some simple teeth, _Hydrophidæ_.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, the maxillary bone shorter, bearing one poison fang with a\r\nperfect canal, and one or two teeth behind it. In some of these there\r\nis a slight mobility.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly_, the maxillary bone so reduced as to be higher than long,\r\nand bearing only a single tooth, viz. a long, curved, and very mobile\r\nfang, _Viperina_.\r\n\r\nThese four classes, be it observed, are only designated ‘roughly\r\nspeaking.’ Nicholson describes a close gradation in the development of\r\nthe poison glands also to correspond with those almost imperceptible\r\nstages. The poison gland is after all only a modified salivary gland.\r\nIt lies behind the eye, whence the venom is conveyed by a duct to the\r\nbase of the fang, down along it, and sometimes through it, and is\r\nemitted at what we may for the present call the point, into the wound\r\nmade by it, something on the principle of an insect’s sting. As when\r\ninserting the sting the pressure forces the poison out of a gland at\r\nits base, so does the pressure of certain muscles act upon the poison\r\ngland when a snake opens its mouth to strike. In some of the most\r\nvenomous, viz. the viperine families, the largely developed glands give\r\nthat peculiar breadth to the head. There is a hideous, repulsive look\r\nabout some of these, that seems to announce their deadly character,\r\neven to those who see one for the first time. The evil expression of\r\nthe eye, with its linear pupil; the peculiar curve of the mouth, with\r\nits very wide gape downwards, and then up again, are unmistakeably\r\ntreacherous, venomous, vicious.\r\n\r\nLike all other animal secretions, the poison is produced, expended,\r\nand renewed, but not always with equal rapidity; climate, season, and\r\ntemperature, as well as the vigour of the reptile, influencing this\r\nsecretion. The hotter the weather, the more active the serpent and all\r\nits functions. When the poison gland is full and the snake angry, you\r\nmay see the venom exuding from the point of the fang, and by a forcible\r\nexpiration the reptile can eject it. I have seen this in the little\r\n_Echis carinata_ and its congener the _Cerastes_. I am not certain\r\nwhether the _Cerastes_ hisses or not, but under terror or excitement\r\nit moves itself about in ‘mystic coils’ as Echis does, producing a\r\nsimilar rustling noise with its scales; but both of them, if angry,\r\nwill strike at you with a sound which may be compared with a sneeze or\r\na spit, at the same time _gnashing_ their mobile fangs and letting you\r\nsee that they have plenty of venom at your service. They may almost be\r\nsaid to ‘spit’ at you, though literally it is the mouth ‘watering with\r\npoison,’ combined with the natural impulse to strike, which produces\r\nthis effect. We can, however, by this judge of the force with which the\r\nvenom is expelled, which in a large viper must be considerable.\r\n\r\nTravellers have told us that a serpent ‘spouts poison into your eye.’\r\nIf an angry one strike, but miss its aim, the poison is then seen to\r\nfly from its mouth, sometimes to a distance of several feet. Whether a\r\nsnake is so good a marksman as to take certain aim with this terrible\r\nprojectile, or whether he possess sufficient intelligence to attempt\r\nit, we may doubt. Dr. Andrew Smith tells us that this belief prevails\r\namong the natives of South Africa.\r\n\r\nA bright object always attracts snakes, and some victimized traveller’s\r\neyes may have been remarkably brilliant, and in consequence smarted\r\nunder the accident. Be that as it may, the poison is sometimes so\r\nabundant that you may see it flow from the mouth over the prey. The\r\nglands being excited, just as are the salivary glands of mammals, the\r\nmouth ‘waters’ with poison. In the Hamadryad I have seen it flow, or\r\nmore correctly ‘dribble,’ down over the snake it was eating. This\r\nnoxious secretion assists digestion in the same way that the ordinary\r\nsaliva in the human mouth does. Says Dr. Carpenter, ‘The saliva\r\nprepares food for the business of the stomach; and if the ordinary\r\noperations of mastication and insalivation be neglected, the stomach\r\nhas to do the whole work of preparation as well as its own especial\r\nduty of the digestion.’ That the digestive powers of snakes are strong,\r\nwe know from the fact that nearly all animal substances are converted\r\nto nutriment in the stomach of a healthy snake. The abundant saliva\r\nmust be a powerful agent in the process, because mastication takes no\r\nshare in the work. This has become more than mere conjecture, since\r\nrecent experiments have shown that snake venom possesses strong peptic\r\nqualities; that, like pancreatic juice, it will even dissolve raw meat\r\nand albuminous substances. Recent experiments have also shown that\r\nthe salivary gland is the laboratory in which the poison of venomous\r\nserpents is elaborated; that ordinary saliva is there intensified,\r\nconcentrated, and endowed with its toxic properties.\r\n\r\nDuring the two hundred years that have witnessed the development of\r\nnatural history into a science, many and various have been the methods\r\nof zoological and particularly of ophiological classification. A\r\nfew of these methods are sketched out in chap. ii. It will be seen\r\nthat the character of the teeth had not for a long while much weight\r\nin classifying snakes. According to Schlegel, Klein in 1755 was\r\nthe first to separate the venomous from the non-venomous snakes in\r\nclassification. But after him Linnæus, then the greatest naturalist of\r\nmodern times, distinguished snakes chiefly by the form of the ventral\r\nand sub-caudal plates; so that in the six genera which he established\r\n(_Amphisbæna_, _Cecilia_, _Crotalus_, _Boa_, _Coluber_, and _Anguis_),\r\nrattlesnakes and boas, colubers and vipers, with others of the most\r\nopposite characters, were jumbled up together; and the little burrowing\r\nblindworm and the venomous sea snakes were supposed to be related,\r\nbecause they neither of them had ventral scales! On account of his\r\nvast researches and great reputation, subsequent naturalists were slow\r\nto entirely overthrow his system and to venture on reforms of their\r\nown, and our cyclopedias are suffering to the present day from the\r\nconfusion of the various methods of classification adopted by so many\r\nnaturalists, as a few quotations presently will show. Dandin, 1802,\r\nthough his work was reckoned by Schlegel the most complete up to his\r\ntime, comprehended all the venomous snakes under the head of ‘vipers.’\r\nCuvier divided the vipers (with _crochets mobiles_) from those with\r\nfixed fangs; but yet was unsound in many other respects, confounding\r\nthe _Elapidæ_ with the _Viperidæ_, although he professed to separate\r\nthem. Another confusion arose out of the word _cobra_, Portuguese\r\nfor snake, so that wherever the Portuguese settled most snakes were\r\n_Cobras_. In India the English have retained the name _Cobra_ for the\r\nsnakes with the hood, which name is now confined to the one group,\r\n_Capella_.\r\n\r\n‘The characters of dentition offer in a great many cases a decisive\r\nmethod for distinguishing the species,’ says Günther; ‘but as regards\r\nthe combination of species into genera and families, it is of no\r\ngreater importance than any other external character by itself....\r\nStill I am always glad to use the dentition as one of the characters of\r\ngenera and species whenever possible—namely, whenever it corresponds\r\nwith the mode of life, the general habits, and the physiology.’[93]\r\n\r\nSince the publication of Dr. Günther’s work, _The Reptiles of British\r\nIndia_, 1864, the distinctions of the various types of dentition\r\nseem to have been more clearly comprehended; and as this work is the\r\naccepted authority among English ophiologists, and will best commend\r\nitself to the reader, it shall be our guide in the present attempt to\r\nsimplify much complication.\r\n\r\nThe five groups of snakes described in chap. ii. are divided into three\r\nsub-orders of Ophidia as follows:—1. _Ophidia colubriformes_ (the\r\nharmless snakes). 2. _Ophidia colubriformes venenosi_ (those which, not\r\nhaving the viperine aspect just now described, are the more dangerous\r\nfrom their innocent appearance). 3. _Ophidia viperiformes_ (the\r\nviperine snakes).\r\n\r\nAlthough apparently named from their form only, it is the teeth which\r\nhave chiefly to do with these latter distinctions, as will be seen on\r\nreference to the dotted examples of upper jaws. The first have the six\r\nrows of simple teeth (four above, as seen, and the lower jaw teeth),\r\nin all from 80 to 100 perhaps. The second have the two rows of palate\r\nteeth, the lower jaw teeth, and a _fixed_ fang on each upper jaw, with\r\none, two, or more simple teeth in addition. The Australian poisonous\r\nserpents are nearly all of this group, the only viperish-looking one,\r\nthe ‘Death adder,’ having fixed fangs like the cobras. The sea snakes\r\nand the _Elapidæ_ are included. The third have only four rows of simple\r\nteeth, viz. those of the lower jaws and those of the palate, with a\r\nsolitary moveable fang in each upper jaw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Fayrer’s _Thanatophidia_. The four larger dots\r\nrepresent fangs.]\r\n\r\nFayrer divides the poisonous snakes of India, again, into four\r\nfamilies, viz. _Elapidæ_ and _Hydrophidæ_, with fixed fangs; and\r\n_Viperidæ_ and _Crotalidæ_, with mobile fangs.\r\n\r\nBut without so many perplexing distinctions, I hope to be able to\r\ninterest the reader in that wonderful piece of mechanism, the poison\r\nfang, and by the aid of the authorities to represent it in simple\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nWe have long been accustomed to read that a serpent’s fang is a\r\n‘perforated tooth’ or a ‘hollow tube,’ as if a miniature tusk had a\r\nhole bored through its entire length, the poison entering at the root\r\nand flowing out again at the point. This is not strictly the case.\r\nFangs in their construction are not absolutely ‘hollow,’ with ivory on\r\nthe outside and pulp on the inside, but are as if you had flattened\r\nout an ivory tusk and folded or wrapped it over again, so as to form a\r\npointed tube. It would then have dentine both on the outer and inner\r\nsurface. This involution may be compared with that seen in a long\r\nnarrow leaf, in which the larva of an insect has enwrapped itself. The\r\nvarious degrees of involution are extremely close, as also would be\r\nthe forms of leaves and the extent of curling which each caterpillar\r\nhad effected. Some fangs are folded so as to leave the—_join_, we\r\nwill call it, easily perceptible. Others leave a groove more or\r\nless evident; while in others the fold is so complete as to have\r\ndisappeared entirely. Schlegel, in describing the insensible passage\r\nfrom solid teeth to fangs, affirms that traces of the groove are always\r\nperceptible: ‘_On découvre toujours les traces de la fente qui réunit\r\nles deux orifices pour le venin._’[94]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two fangs magnified, showing the slit more or less\r\ncomplete. _c_, a section. From Fayrer’s _Thanatophidia_.]\r\n\r\nIn a mixed collection of thirty odd fangs of various snakes lent to\r\nme by Holland, the keeper, for examination, and sent all together in a\r\nlittle box, there were few in which I could not discern the join. The\r\nkeeper was not sure to which snakes each belonged, excepting one or two\r\nof the largest, which were those of a puff adder. Those of the larger\r\n_Crotalidæ_ I could identify by the peculiar curve. In a functional\r\nfang of the ‘bushmaster’ (_Lachesis mutus_), which I myself took from\r\nits jaw, there is a well-defined line, like a crack, the whole way\r\ndown, from the base to the slit; in a rattlesnake fang, also in my\r\npossession, there is a faint appearance of this line or join; and in a\r\nyoung Crotalus fang it is still there,—only a faint crack, such as you\r\nwould contemplate with alarm in your egg-shell china, still there it is.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to explain that fangs differ in size in\r\ndifferent families, as well as proportionately to the size of the\r\npossessor. In sea snakes they are not much larger than the simple teeth\r\nbehind them. In the Cobra they are larger than in the Bungarus; in the\r\nviper they attain their largest size.\r\n\r\nBut in one respect all fangs agree, and that is in their delicacy and\r\nfineness. Under the microscope, the stronger the lens the greater the\r\ndegree of exquisite polish and sharpness revealed. To handle those\r\nof very young vipers is as difficult as it would be to handle fine\r\nneedle-points of similar length. One can compare them with nothing\r\nelse, except perhaps the fine thorns of the sweet briar, which are\r\nequally unmanageable, and, as compared with manufactured articles,\r\nequally exquisite.\r\n\r\nSir Samuel Baker describes the fangs (both functional and\r\nsupplementary) of a puff adder which he found. His words, if not\r\nstrictly scientific, are so graphic as to convey a true idea of these\r\nterrible weapons. The viper was five feet four inches long, and fifteen\r\ninches in girth in its largest part. The head was two and a half inches\r\nbroad. Sir Samuel counted ‘eight teeth’ (fangs), and secured five of\r\nthem, the two most prominent being nearly one inch long. ‘The poison\r\nfangs are artfully contrived, by some diabolical freak of nature, as\r\npointed tubes, through which the poison is injected into the base of\r\nthe wound inflicted. The extreme point of the fang is solid, and is so\r\nfinely sharpened that beneath a powerful microscope it is perfectly\r\nsmooth, although the point of the finest needle is rough!’[95] He\r\ndescribes the aperture in the fang as like a tiny slit cut in a quill.\r\n\r\nThis ‘slit’ is a very important feature in the fang, and is the cause\r\nof much trouble in deciding whether a bitten person has been poisoned\r\nor not. It is in reality a very small space _near_ the point, where the\r\ninvolution of the fang is incomplete, that is, where it has remained\r\nunjoined. This is to permit the emission of the venom. It is not\r\nclose to the point, which, as Sir S. Baker affirms, is solid. Being\r\nsolid, it is stronger and sharper, penetrating the skin of the victim\r\nmore easily, and making way for the venom which in viperine fangs\r\nthen follows and escapes through the slit into the wound. By this we\r\ncomprehend how a person may receive a puncture only, or a scratch with\r\nthis extreme but solid point, but not deep enough for the poison to\r\nenter. The space between the lines at _a_ in the next illustration\r\nshows where this slit in the fang is found. In the larger fangs it\r\nmay be readily discerned with the naked eye: under a magnifying glass\r\nit is distinguishable in all. It is distinct in the fangs of the young\r\nJararacas now before me, and extends nearly half-way up the fang in\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nThe examples of fangs here given are all from nature, and as near to\r\nthe exact size as it is possible to be in delineating objects of such\r\nexceeding fineness and delicacy. Excepting the _Xenodon’s_ and the baby\r\nviper’s, the others belong to the _Crotalidæ_, whose fangs are mostly\r\ndistinguishable by a slight double curve or flange. The viperine fang\r\nis a continuous curve (see _f_), but in the _Crotalus_ the point curves\r\nvery slightly back again and downwards.\r\n\r\nFor the Brazilian specimens, I am indebted to Dr. Arthur Stradling, who\r\npresented me with the snakes, out of whose jaws I myself procured them.\r\nIn this _Lachesis_ there were two fangs _visible_ on one side, and\r\nonly one on the other, viz. the functional pair, and one nearly ready\r\nto replace one of these. In addition to the pair were four reserve\r\nfangs hidden under the functional one on the right side. I say ‘under,’\r\nbecause anatomically they were _beneath_, though locally _above_ when\r\nthe snake was in its natural position. All these five fangs I got from\r\nonly one side, and in addition some others too small to represent.\r\nThere may be yet more in the membranous capsule, as mine was a sadly\r\nunscientific search for them, and without any very powerful magnifier.\r\nLike Charas, I ‘grovelled’ for them! From a young _Jararaca_ I also got\r\nout the functional and four or five supplementary fangs from one side,\r\nalso an exceedingly small and short jaw-bone, leaving the other side\r\nundisturbed. Even the principal fang (_d_) is too fine to represent\r\nfaithfully in printer’s ink; the others are to the naked eye and to the\r\ntouch almost impalpable. When we reflect on the exquisite sharpness and\r\nfinish of these minute weapons, and the fatal injury they are capable\r\nof inflicting, we are filled with awe and amazement at the virulence of\r\nthe subtle fluid which oozes through that almost invisible aperture.\r\nThe brother of this tiny African viper (_f_), when only a few hours\r\nold, struck a mouse, which was dead in less than one minute. The whole\r\nforty-six of them (p. 321) were born with the ‘murderous teeth’ in\r\ntheir vicious little jaws. The fang here represented was loose in its\r\nmouth. A pair of perfect functional fangs remained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fangs and some simple teeth from my specimens.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Functional fang and four supplementary fangs from _Lachesis\r\n       mutus_ (Brazil).\r\n  _b._ Rattlesnake fang.\r\n  _c._ Fang of young rattlesnake (Brazil).\r\n  _d._ Fang of young _Jararaca_ (Brazil).\r\n  _e._ Pseudo ‘fang’ of _Xenodon_ (Brazil).\r\n  _f._ Loose fang from the mouth of _Vipera nasicornis_, aged one week.\r\n  _g._ Portion of palate bone bearing four teeth, from _Lachesis mutus_\r\n       (Brazil).\r\n  _h._ Two lower teeth from the same.]\r\n\r\nPicture to yourselves the intensity of that invisible molecule of\r\nvenom, which could ooze through an equally invisible aperture in this\r\nlast diminutive weapon, and be fatal to life in a minute of time! From\r\nthe effects observed on victims, I am inclined to place these large\r\nAfrican vipers amongst the most venomous of all serpents of their size.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to remark that the fang of the baby viper found\r\nloose in its mouth does not resemble those remaining, either in form\r\nor structure. That it cannot be a jaw tooth is evident from its size.\r\nJaw and palate teeth there are, but discernible only to the touch,\r\nand under a magnifying glass. The fixed fang from the side on which\r\nI found this loose one, is a trifle shorter, and much finer than its\r\nfellow. In the loose one here given I can hardly discern any involution\r\nat all, but on touching it with the inky point of a fine needle, the\r\nstain shows it be hollow, and clearly so, at its base. In the two fixed\r\nfangs, however, the involution is so incomplete that, minute as they\r\nare, the point of a very fine needle can be drawn all down them without\r\nslipping off.\r\n\r\nOne of them, the larger, on being touched with ink, revealed this\r\nopen groove or incomplete involution so distinctly that I tried the\r\nother and was convinced at once. The loose one may be a first and\r\nonly half-developed fang. They are almost as transparent as glass. I\r\nrequested the keeper to look into the mouths of those subsequently\r\ndead, but he found no other loose fangs. Of the remaining forty-five\r\ndeceased, let us hope those into whose hands they have fallen will be\r\nable to throw some further light on the development of fangs in very\r\nyoung vipers. Fayrer tells us that a young cobra is not venomous until\r\nit has cast its first skin, which is usually within a fortnight. White\r\nof Selborne found no trace of fangs in young vipers which he examined\r\nwith a lens; but these had not yet been born. The possible cause of\r\nfunctional development in this little viper’s fangs may be found in\r\nchap. xxiv. of this work.\r\n\r\nAnother erroneous impression regarding fangs has been produced by\r\nconfusing those that are ‘fixed’ and those that are ‘moveable.’ All\r\ntruly are fixed firmly into the jaw; but in the viperine snakes the\r\nvery short bone itself is moveable by a volitionary action, so that it\r\npartially ‘rotates,’ and with it the fang. The _Elapidæ_ have fixed or\r\n‘permanently erect’ fangs, and when the mouth is closed these fit into\r\na depression in the lower jaw. Viperine fangs only can be erected or\r\ndepressed at pleasure. It is those which spring into place for use like\r\na pen-knife half opened, and which when at rest are folded back, like\r\nthe knife shut up again. This action has been most lucidly described by\r\nCoues in connection with the _Crotalidæ_, under which head I will quote\r\nfrom his paper. Schlegel himself is not very clear in his distinctions\r\nbetween those serpents that have ‘moveable’ fangs and those which have\r\nnot, but Cuvier had already described them as _crochets mobiles_.\r\nIndeed, it is since the date of Schlegel’s work that more complete\r\ninvestigations have revealed closer anatomical distinctions. We\r\ntherefore find in some of our highest-class encyclopedias, if not of\r\nrecent date, mis-statements regarding fangs which unfortunately have\r\nbeen quoted in many works. ‘Venomous serpents depress their fangs,’\r\nsays Schlegel’s translator, true to the text, but as if it were common\r\nto all. Describing deglutition, Schlegel says ‘the same in all’ ‘_sans\r\nen excepter les venimeux, qui lors de cet acte redressent leur crochets\r\net les cachent dans la gaine des gencives, pour ne point les exposer\r\nà des injures_.’[96] This, however, is the case with the _Viperina_\r\nonly. It is common, for the reasons just now assigned, to find the\r\ncobra classed among the vipers, in some popular encyclopedias; and in\r\none, a valuable and generally trustworthy American edition of 1875, we\r\nread, ‘moveable fangs like the cobra, viper, and rattlesnake.’ A cobra\r\nhas _not_ moveable fangs. Another, an excellent English edition, but of\r\nnot very recent date, includes _all_ venomous snakes under the head of\r\n‘vipers;’ a third in general terms states that ‘venomous snakes have no\r\nteeth in the upper jaws, excepting the fangs, and that the opening of\r\nthe mouth brings these into position;’ whereas it is now known that a\r\nviper can open its mouth and yet keep its fangs depressed and sheathed.\r\nIn several other encyclopedias the description of fangs is suited to\r\nvipers only.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to designate names, as these things will be set\r\nright in the new editions. They are mentioned more with a view to\r\nshow that ophiology has advanced with rapid strides of late, rather\r\nthan presumptuously to criticise our standard works. Perhaps in\r\nanother twenty years my own poor efforts will be exposed as ‘old-time\r\nmisconceptions.’\r\n\r\nThe renewal of poison fangs is another subject of interest to\r\nophiologists: how the next supplementary fang becomes fixed,\r\n_anchylosed_ to the jaw-bone; and how and when the connection with\r\nthe poison duct is completed. Mr. Tombes, in a paper read before the\r\nRoyal Society in 1875, describes a ‘scaffolding’ of bone thrown out\r\nto meet and grasp the new fang, to ‘interdigitate and fix it in its\r\nplace; this soft bone rapidly developing and hardening.’ Sufficiently\r\nmarvellous is the functional fang in itself; the insertion of the\r\nvenom, a mode of subcutaneous injection invented long before the\r\ndoctors thought of it. ‘A most perfect hypodermic syringe,’ Huxley\r\ncalls it. Suddenly the hypodermic syringe is removed, say by accident,\r\nby force, or by gradual decay, and all connection with the gland is cut\r\noff; yet within a given period a second, a third, an unlimited number\r\nin turn replace it: the connection is restored and the hypodermic\r\nsyringe is ready for action again. How the new one is brought into\r\nrelation with the poison duct has afforded much speculation, and\r\nin the American scientific journals, as well as those of Europe,\r\npapers on this subject appear from time to time. Dr. Weir Mitchell of\r\nPhiladelphia affirms that when the fang is lost by natural process\r\nit is replaced in a few days: when by violence, several weeks elapse\r\nbefore the next is firmly fixed.[97] He speaks of the rattlesnake\r\nchiefly. Fayrer gives the periods in several cobra experiments. In one\r\ncobra whose fangs were carefully drawn out on Oct. 7th, new fangs were\r\n‘anchylosed’ to the bone in twenty-four days. In another, thirty-one\r\ndays elapsed before the new ones were ready for use; and in two others,\r\neighteen days. In all of these cases the new fangs were capable of\r\ninflicting deadly injury by the time stated.\r\n\r\nBut the perfection of mechanism culminates in the viper fangs; and\r\nreasoning from analogy, the intensity of poison in their glands also.\r\nWhen at rest, these lie supine along the jaw, but can be ‘erected,’\r\n_i.e._ sprung down, for use by a special muscle. The two fangs above\r\nthe dotted illustration of viperine dentition (p. 355) show both\r\npositions. Nicholson affirms that the Indian viper Daboia can inject\r\nas much poison in half a second as a cobra can in three seconds; ‘that\r\nwhereas a cobra’s virus flows in small droplets, the viper’s runs in\r\na fine stream.’ Though a much smaller snake than the cobra, Daboia’s\r\nfangs are nearly double the size, as may be observed by comparing the\r\nfigs. _C_ and _D_ (p. 349). There seems reason to believe also that\r\nthis viper (which in its features Fayrer considers a true Indian type)\r\ncan inflict injury with more than the pair of functional fangs. ‘In\r\nreference to the connection of the poison fangs with the maxillary\r\nbones,’ says this learned experimentalist, ‘I would note that second\r\nor even third supplementary fangs may be anchylosed with the principal\r\none to the maxillary bone. I have before me the skull of a Daboia, for\r\nwhich I am indebted to Mr. Sceva, in which this is the case; and where\r\nthere are five well-developed poison fangs on each side, of which on\r\none side two are anchylosed to the bone.’[98] (Described by Mr. Tombes,\r\n_Phil. Trans._ vol. clxvi. p. 146.)\r\n\r\nThis may explain what we so often read in the description of venomous\r\nsnakes found with two, three, or more fangs on each side. In my\r\n_Lachesis_ two were distinctly visible before I began to dig for those\r\nhidden in the loose membrane, of which there seemed an abundance, and\r\nI am nearly certain that the second one had its own particular sheath.\r\nThe spirit in which the specimen had so long been immersed, as well as\r\nmy awkward probings, forbid me to speak with certainty regarding this\r\nsecond sheath.\r\n\r\nAfter one of his rattlesnake bites—twenty days after—Dr. Stradling\r\ninformed me by letter: ‘My little _durissus_ is shedding its skin; but\r\nwhen that is over, I shall certainly examine its mouth. Now that my arm\r\nis on the verge of ulceration, I find what I had not noticed before,\r\nthat each puncture is _double_—two large ones and a tiny second one,\r\nabout 1/12 inch behind each, standing out in black relief against the\r\nscarlet skin.’\r\n\r\nNeither of these experimentalists stated positively that the reserve\r\nfangs were in connection with the duct, a phenomenon which I believe\r\nis still unexplained. Fayrer removed the functional fangs from an\r\n_Echis carinata_, and observed that there were no others fixed at the\r\ntime, though there were others loose in the mucous membrane. _On the\r\nfifth day another pair were anchylosed and ready for use!_ As will be\r\npresently seen, this little viper of sixteen or eighteen inches (almost\r\ntoo small to recognise near the great python in the frontispiece),\r\ndisplays corresponding vigour both in the potency of its venom and in\r\nthe renewal of its weapons.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing illustrations of numerous pointed teeth, the\r\nquestion might arise, ‘How are they disposed of when the mouth is\r\nclosed? and from the narrow space which is apparent in the flat head\r\nof a snake, and the close fit of the jaws, how do the four or six rows\r\nmeet without interfering with each other?’ This difficulty is obviated\r\nby the teeth _not_ closing one upon the other as ours do. Nor are the\r\npalate teeth in the centre, or they would wound the upper part of the\r\ntrachea and the tongue sheath, which occupy considerable space. They\r\nclose down on each side of these organs. ‘Every relief on one surface\r\nfits into a corresponding depression on the other surface, and accurate\r\napposition of every part is obtained,’ Nicholson explains to us. ‘The\r\nfour upper rows of teeth divide the roof into three parts, and the\r\nlower jaw teeth fit between the upper maxillary and palatine teeth.’\r\n\r\nThere remains yet much more to describe in connection with the poison\r\nfang, which might come in the present chapter; but as the two following\r\nwill treat of the _Viperidæ_ and the _Crotalidæ_—the dentition being\r\nthe same in both—the viperine fangs shall claim further space under\r\nthose heads. These three consecutive chapters, and also chap. xxii.\r\non some exceptional forms of dentition, must necessarily be somewhat\r\nblended; but I divide them thus in order to present the distinct\r\nfamilies more clearly, and render the subject less tedious to the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n_VIPERINE FANGS._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGH the ensuing chapter will be devoted more exclusively to the\r\n_Crotalidæ_ or rattlesnakes, it were well to repeat here that the two\r\nfamilies _Viperidæ_ and _Crotalidæ_ comprise the sub-order of Ophidia\r\n‘VIPERINA,’—those that have the isolated, moveable fangs, the term\r\n_isolated_ having reference to the functional fang only. It may appear\r\nincongruous to present the illustration of a viperine jaw with a whole\r\ncluster of fangs, while affirming that there is the one pair only; but\r\nthe pair in use are ‘solitary,’ because the jaw bears no simple teeth,\r\nas in those with fixed or permanently erect fangs.\r\n\r\nThe first observation of the mobility of the viperine fang and its\r\npeculiar structure is ascribed to Felix Fontana,[99] an eminent\r\nnaturalist and Professor of Philosophy at Pisa, in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. He formed the cabinet of Natural History at Florence, and died\r\n1805, in his 75th year. But the _mobility_ or action of rattlesnake\r\nfangs was known long prior to Fontana, and he probably borrowed the\r\nexpression ‘dog-teeth’ from the old Virginia writers who thus called\r\nthe fangs. Purchas (1614), quoted in chap. xvi., describes ‘venomous\r\nSerpentes, one ten Spannes long, with great Tuskes, which they hide and\r\nstretch out at pleasure.’[100] And again, in describing ‘foure kinds\r\nof venomous Snakes. The first is greatest, Jararacucu, that is great\r\nJararaca, and they are ten Spannes long: they have great Tuskes hidden\r\nin the Mouth along their Gummes, and when they bite they stretch them\r\nlike a Finger of the Hand; they have their Poyson in their Gummes,\r\ntheir Teeth crooked, and a Stroake vpon them whereby the Poison\r\nrunneth. Others say they have it within the Tooth which is hollow\r\nwithin. It hath so vehement a Poison that in foure-and-twentie Houres\r\nand lesse it killeth a Man.’[101]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt but that viperine fangs are here described, those\r\nbelonging to the South American _Crotalidæ_, under their vernacular\r\nbut then their only names. Dr. Ed. Tyson, who dissected the first\r\nrattlesnake that was handed over to science (p. 275), quite understood\r\nthe mobility of the fangs, and of the existence of supplementary teeth,\r\nthough not fully comprehending the nature of these latter; which ‘I\r\ncould not perceive were fastened to any Bone, but to Muscles or Tendons\r\nthere. These Fangs were not to be perceived upon first opening the\r\nMouth, they lying couched under a strong Membrane or Sheath, but so as\r\ndid make a large Riseing there on the Outside of the lesser Teeth of\r\nthe Maxilla’ (meaning the reserve fangs), ‘but at Pleasure when alive\r\nthey could raise them to do Execution with, not unlike as a Lyon or a\r\nCat does its Claws.’[102]\r\n\r\nHe found seven reserve fangs on each side; and though they were not, as\r\nhe tells us, ‘fastened to any bone,’ the illustration represents them\r\ngrowing in regular order according to size in the jaw.\r\n\r\nIn another paper read before the Royal Society in 1726, also anterior\r\nto Fontana, on the ‘Fangs of the Rattlesnake,’ the writer, Captain\r\nHall, describes the dissection, which was under the direction of Sir\r\nHans Sloane; and ‘then the Muscles that raise the poisonous Fangs\r\nappear.’ This anatomist also found reserve fangs. ‘Putting by this\r\nMembrane, the fatal Fangs appear, which on first View seemed only one\r\non each Side, till searching further there appeared four more. The\r\nfirst and largest is fixed in a Bone;’ four others were loose in the\r\nmembrane.[103]\r\n\r\nSeveral of the old authors quoted in the chapter on Rattlesnake History\r\nof the Seventeenth Century were quite aware of the action of the\r\n‘Springing Teeth,’ ‘Master Teeth,’ or ‘Canine Teeth,’ as the fangs were\r\nvariously called; and Lawson, 1707, describes ‘the Teeth which poison\r\nare two on each side of the Upper Jaws. These are bent like a Sickle,\r\nand hang loose as if by a Joint.’ Fontana’s observations were possibly\r\nof greater scientific importance, otherwise it is singular that his\r\nequally thoughtful predecessors, from whom he no doubt culled much\r\nimportant information, should have been overlooked.\r\n\r\nIn these viperine fangs there is an analogy between the vipers and the\r\nlophius, a fish with moveable teeth; only in the fish, as Owen tells\r\nus, the action is not volitional,—the teeth bend back to admit food,\r\nand then by elastic muscles spring up again to retain it.\r\n\r\nThe true nature of the reserve fangs was surmised by Mr. John Bartram,\r\nwho in 1734 wrote from German Town, in the American colonies, to a\r\nF.R.S., ‘On a Cluster of Small Teeth at the Root of each Fang or Great\r\nTooth.’[104] He had a rattlesnake, ‘now a Rarity near our Settlements,’\r\nand dissected it, when he ‘found in the Head what has not been observed\r\nbefore by any that I can remember; _i.e._ a Cluster of Teeth on each\r\nside of the Upper Jaw at the Root of the Great Fangs through which\r\nthe Poison is ejected. In the same Case that the two main Teeth were\r\nsheathed in, lay four others at the Root of each Tooth in a Cluster of\r\nthe same Shape and Figure as the great ones, and I am apt to think for\r\nthe same Use and Purposes, if by an Accident the main Teeth happen to\r\nbe broken. May not these be placed to supply a Defect successively, for\r\nthe Support of this Creature?’\r\n\r\nMr. Bartram was singularly correct in his diffidently-offered surmises;\r\nnor is it likely that in such a remote district as German Town then\r\nwas, he had ready access to foreign publications, or would have claimed\r\noriginality had he been cognisant of the work of M. Moyse Charas,\r\n_New Experiments upon Vipers_, translated from the original French\r\nin 1673. Charas, after describing the ‘_Great Teeth_,’ refers to the\r\n‘smaller teeth’ (reserve fangs) ‘that are there in a Nursery, and are,\r\nif we may say so, in expectation to serve instead of the many Teeth,\r\nwhether these come to fail of their force, or fall out of themselves.’\r\nThe author, to add weight to conclusions evidently originating from\r\npersonal investigations, tells us that he had ‘taken Pains to grovel\r\nwith a good deal of Patience in the Gums of innumerable Vipers.’\r\n\r\nThe Italian Redi, even prior to Charas, had also ‘grovelled’ in\r\nthe gums of Vipers, and observed the canal or slit in the fang,\r\n‘_si fendono per lo lungo dalla radice alla punta_,’ and that these\r\ncanaliculated teeth in the moveable jaws (_ossi mobili_) were for the\r\nconveyance of the venom.[105]\r\n\r\nThus, one hundred years prior to the work of Fontana, the structure of\r\nthe viperine jaw was understood and described by several—we may almost\r\nsay many—anatomists, to whom let due honour be rendered for their\r\nindividual and independent researches; from all of which Fontana had\r\ndoubtless benefited.\r\n\r\nAnd so from numerous sources we might go on culling and quoting;\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ of France, Florence, Germany, and America,\r\nas well as of England, showing us that little by little the scientific\r\nworkers examine, compare, correspond, till out of their life’s labours\r\na fact is established that may be printed and learned in six lines, but\r\nwhich—as is well worth remembering—often represents the brain and\r\neyes and time of ages of scientists.\r\n\r\nNext to engage attention was the _structure_ of the fang and the\r\n‘involution’ described in the last chapter. A paper on this subject by\r\nThos. Smith, Esq., F.R.S., was read before the Royal Society in 1818.\r\nMr. Smith claims to have been the first to observe this involution as\r\nbeing altogether different from the perforation of the pulp originally\r\nsupposed to be the case. He first noticed the slit in a cobra’s fang\r\n(he being in India), and afterwards in a Hydrus (sea snake), and it\r\nled him to further investigations. With a microscope the slit was\r\nperceptible in a rattlesnake fang (which was also observed by the\r\npresent writer before reading this account).\r\n\r\nOne more paper in the _Philosophical Transactions_ on this subject\r\nmust be commended to the interested student. It is the one already\r\nquoted (p. 363), ‘On the Succession of Poison Fangs,’ by Charles\r\nTombes, M.A., vol. clxvi. p. 470, 1876. In this paper is presented the\r\nresult of all the most recent investigations, enriched by still deeper\r\nresearches, but of too scientific a character to be introduced in this\r\nsimple narrative of the progress of ophiology. We may, however, say\r\nthat Mr. Tombes finds the character or function of succession differs\r\nin the vipers from that of the venomous colubrines; and this, as the\r\nconstruction of their fangs and maxillary jaw differs, is what we might\r\nlook for.\r\n\r\nA few more words descriptive of the external aspect of the _Viperidæ_\r\nmay summarize what has already been said of them. Schlegel suggests\r\nthat their ‘noxious character is expressed in all their parts.’\r\nWith the exception of brilliant colouring, this may be accepted as\r\na rule. The broad, flat, angular head, rendering the ‘neck’ thin\r\nand conspicuous, has gained for many of them the generic, sometimes\r\nspecific name of _Trigonocephalus_. From their deadly qualities,\r\n_Clotho_, _Severa Atrox_, _Lachesis_, and _Atropos_ are among their\r\nnames; while _caudalis_ and _brachyura_ describe the short, thin tail\r\nas opposed to the long and tapering tails of most colubrines. The true\r\nvipers—those that have not the nasal fosse—belong particularly to\r\nAfrica, the _Crotalidæ_ proper to America, the chief distinction being\r\nthat the _Crotalidæ_ have and the _Viperidæ_ have _not_ the ‘pit’ (see\r\np. 277), of which more in the next chapter. The rigid, lanceolate\r\nscales covering the head are another viperine characteristic; also\r\nthick, heavy bodies, tapering at each end, and rough, carinated scales.\r\nThey inhabit for the most part dry, arid deserts and sandy uncultivated\r\nplaces of the Old World, Africa being their most congenial habitat. The\r\ncoloured viper and young one convey a good idea of their general aspect.\r\n\r\nOphiologists do not agree in the arrangement of genera and species,\r\non account of the forms running so much into each other. Gray gives\r\nnine genera and twenty species; Wallace, three genera and twenty-two\r\nspecies; and Dumeril, six genera and seventeen species. The Death\r\nadder of Australia (p. 172) is a heterogeneous species. Its aspect\r\nis viperine, yet it has not viperine fangs, and does not therefore\r\nbelong to this chapter. Schlegel thinks it ought not to be separated\r\nfrom the true vipers, but Krefft does not state positively that it is\r\nviviparous, so it is altogether anomalous.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Dr. Weir Mitchel of Philadelphia have been of great\r\nvalue to ophiologists. For two whole years he gave the best portion\r\nof his time to the study of rattlesnakes, having a number of them\r\nunder constant observation. An exhaustive paper by him was published\r\nin the _Smithsonian Contributions_, Washington, D.C., in 1860, giving\r\ndetails of experiments with the venom and the treatments adopted. But\r\nof especial interest here are his observations on the fangs and their\r\nvolitional action, it having previously been supposed that the mere\r\nopening of the mouth brought the fangs into position, which is not the\r\ncase. As the _Crotalus_ can move each side of its mouth independently,\r\nso it can use one or both fangs. ‘When the mouth is opened widely,\r\nit still has perfect control over the fang, raising or depressing it\r\nat will.’ Dr. Mitchel saw that though both fangs were present, both\r\nwere not always used. When a viperine snake yawns extensively, as it\r\nso often does, you may sometimes perceive the fangs partially erected\r\nor entirely so, or the ‘vibratile motion’ in them observed by Fayrer.\r\nWhen the snake is angry, this vibratile action is much like that of\r\na cat gnashing the teeth; but when only in a yawn, the partial and\r\nunequal erection of one or both fangs has the appearance of being\r\ninvoluntary. In this I speak from observation. The effect is similar to\r\nthat seen about a person’s mouth in trying to suppress a yawn—a sort\r\nof convulsive, nervous twitching. Whatever the cause, you perceive the\r\nfangs moving, but _not_ moving always in accord.\r\n\r\nThe shedding or replacement of the fangs is, Dr. Mitchel thinks, a\r\nregular process, as in the teeth of some fishes, though not regular\r\nas to time. Sometimes, but not always, they are shed with the casting\r\nof the cuticle. He ‘cannot suppose that the almost mature secondaries\r\nare awaiting an accident;’ which agrees precisely with the opinions\r\nof Dr. Edward Nicholson and other physiologists quoted in the last\r\nchapter: ‘A crop of young teeth’ (or of fangs) ‘work their way into the\r\nintervals of the old teeth, and gradually expel these latter.’ When\r\nlost by accident or by violence, therefore, the process of replacement\r\nis slower, as we can readily conceive, the ‘secondary’ next in turn not\r\nbeing as yet ready for duty.\r\n\r\nThough the American scientific journals devoted to zoology are rich\r\nin ophidian literature, there are few available to English students;\r\nand I regret I am unable to ascertain from across the Atlantic the\r\nlatest researches and conclusions regarding this and several other\r\ncorrelative points. To Professor Martin Duncan I am indebted for the\r\nloan of a volume which forms one of the ‘Bulletins’ of the United\r\nStates Geological Surveys, containing a valuable ‘Report’ on the\r\nCrotalus by Dr. Elliot Coues, of the United States army, late surgeon\r\nand naturalist to the United States Northern Boundary Commission, 1878.\r\n\r\nIt is these frequent Exploring Expeditions of America that have done so\r\nmuch to enrich science in all its branches; as to them are appointed\r\nefficient geologists, botanists, naturalists, and other scientists, who\r\nsend in their ‘Reports’ to Government, to be soon reproduced in the\r\nform of large, handsomely-illustrated volumes. Copies of these (often\r\nconsisting of ten to eighteen thick quartos) are presented to the\r\nmembers of Congress, governors of States, and to many others in office,\r\nalso to literary institutions. You may have access to them in almost\r\nevery large town in America; and there is no information connected\r\nwith the history and natural productions of the nation (including\r\nthe aborigines) that cannot be found in their pages. And as our\r\nTransatlantic cousins are always exploring some new territory, and have\r\nstill untold square miles of mountain and valley to explore, their\r\nscientific ‘Reports’ in huge quarto tomes can be more easily imagined\r\nthan counted.\r\n\r\nThis little digression from the viperine fangs is by way of introducing\r\nDr. Elliot Coues. The volume in question was not forthcoming at the\r\nBritish Museum, therefore I ventured to trouble Professor Duncan with\r\nsome inquiries, which were kindly responded to by the sight of the work\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThere is in Dr. Coues’ paper a good deal of what has been here already\r\ndescribed; but there is also so much that is of additional interest,\r\nthat for the benefit of those students who are not within reach of the\r\nBritish Museum (where, no doubt, the fast arriving quartos will get\r\ncatalogued in due time), I will transcribe from the text some of the\r\npassages as relating to viperine fangs generally.\r\n\r\n‘The active instruments are a pair of fangs.’ ... They are ‘somewhat\r\nconical and scythe shaped, with an extremely fine point; the\r\nconvexity looks forward, the front downward and backward’ (referring\r\nto the slight double curve in the Crotalus fang as shown in the\r\nillustration, p. 360). They are hollow by folding, ‘till they meet,\r\nconverting an exterior surface first into a groove, finally into a\r\ntube.’ ... The fang is ‘moveable, and was formerly supposed to be\r\nhinged in its socket. But it is firmly socketed, and the maxillary\r\nitself moves, which rocks to and fro by a singular contrivance. The\r\nmaxillary is a small, stout, triangular bone, moveably articulated\r\nabove with a smaller bone, the lachrymal, which is itself hinged upon\r\nthe frontal.... This forward impulse of the palatal and pterygoid\r\nis communicated to the maxillary, against which they abut, causing\r\nthe latter to rotate upon the lachrymal. In this rocking forward of\r\nthe maxillary, the socket of the fang, and with it the tooth itself,\r\nrotates in such a manner that the apex of the tooth describes the arc\r\nof a circle, and finally points downward instead of backward. This\r\nprotrusion of the fang is not an automatic motion, consequent upon the\r\nmere opening of the mouth, as formerly supposed, but a volitional act,\r\nas the reverse motion, viz. the folding back of the fang, also is;\r\nso that in simply feeding the fangs are not erected.’ (But I think I\r\nmay affirm positively that sometimes the vipers do use their fangs in\r\nfeeding. When they open their mouths—or rather the jaws alternately\r\nvery wide—I have seen first one and then the other fang occasionally\r\nengaged in the food and again disengaged unsheathed. On other occasions\r\nthe fangs have been folded. In some large African vipers, the ‘River\r\nJack’ and others that were in the Society’s Gardens a few years ago, I\r\nwas able to observe this easily.)\r\n\r\nThe fang is folded back ‘with an action comparable to the shutting of\r\nthe blade of a pocket-knife; ... one set of muscles prepares the fangs\r\nfor action, the other set stows them away when not wanted.... The\r\nfangs are further protected by a contrivance for sheathing them, like\r\na sword in its scabbard. A fold of mucous membrane envelops the tooth\r\nlike a hood.... The erection causes the sheath to slip, like the finger\r\nof a glove, and gather in folds round its base.... It can be examined\r\nwithout dissection.’ (And with the naked eye in a large viper, even\r\nduring life, you may sometimes perceive this sheath or hood half off.)\r\n‘Each developing fang is enclosed in a separate capsule,’ says Dr.\r\nMitchel, which is just what I thought I saw in ‘grovelling’ up the poor\r\nBushmaster’s reserve fangs. There was an immense deal of loose skin to\r\nremove, which under skilful manipulation would doubtless have presented\r\nthe form of sheaths of various sizes. At last I came to a great deep\r\ncavity as big as a bean or a hazel nut, and this I left neat and\r\nuninjured for some one else to explore. It might have been the poison\r\ngland! The young Jararaca’s mouth is too small to reveal its mysteries.\r\n\r\nBut now we come to the most amazing of all the wondrous detail of\r\nthis living hypodermic syringe. Those who have seen a viper or a\r\nrattlesnake strike its prey, are cognisant of the lightning-like\r\nrapidity of the action. So swift is it that often a spectator is not\r\nsure whether the snake touched the victim or not. A flicker, a flash,\r\nand the bite has been given. Dr. Mitchel, describing the singular\r\ninactivity of rattlesnakes in confinement, points out the striking\r\ncontrast between this repose and the perilous rapidity of their\r\nstroke. Now let us look at the amount of business transacted in that\r\nflash of time. Says Dr. Elliot Coues: ‘The train of action is first\r\nreaching the object; secondly, the blow; thirdly, the penetration;\r\nfourthly, the injection; and fifthly, the enlargement of the wound\r\n(the latter by dragging upon it the whole weight of the body by the\r\ncontraction of certain muscles, which cause the fangs to be buried\r\ndeeper and thus enlarge the puncture); and all these five actions\r\naccomplished in that instantaneous stroke!’ This is what Fayrer means\r\nwhen explaining that ‘the real bite is when the snake seizes, retains\r\nits hold, and thoroughly imbeds its fangs.’ ‘Sometimes the lower teeth\r\nand the palatine become entangled (and sometimes a fang is left in the\r\nwound).... The force of ejection may be seen when a serpent striking\r\nviolently misses its aim, and the stream has been seen to spirt five\r\nor six feet. A blow given in anger is always accompanied by the spirt\r\nof venom, even if the fangs fail to engage.’ ... Another curious piece\r\nof mechanism, and one not previously described that I am aware of, is\r\na provision for the fangs when they fail to bite. ‘A serpent always\r\nsnaps his jaws together, and thoroughly _closes them_ when he strikes;\r\ntherefore, if the fangs failed to engage, they would penetrate the\r\nlower jaw. But there is a certain movement among the loose bones of the\r\nskull (perhaps not yet thoroughly made out), the result of which is\r\nto spread the points of the fangs apart, so that they clear the inner\r\nsides of the under jaw, instead of injuring them.’ Coues here describes\r\nrattlesnakes particularly, but no doubt the same extends throughout the\r\nviperines.... ‘In a large snake the entire gland may be an inch long\r\nand one-fourth as wide, having the capacity of ten or fifteen drops\r\nof fluid. There is no special reservoir for the venom other than the\r\ncentral cavity of the gland. Formerly there was thought to be such a\r\nstorehouse; but when the tooth is folded back, certain muscles press\r\nor compress the canal to prevent a wasteful flow: in other words, the\r\ncommunication is shut off!’\r\n\r\nIn this wonderful exhibition of the ivory hypodermic syringe there\r\nhas not, I trust, been so much repetition as to render the subject\r\ntedious. Presented in such graphic language and from such a source, it\r\nmust attract almost every intelligent reader, while the viperine fang\r\nis absolutely acting before his eyes. On this subject, then, no more\r\nneed be said; though on the Crotalus family generally some interesting\r\nmatter still remains to be told.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n_THE CROTALIDÆ._\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the several chapters in which the rattlesnake has been introduced,\r\nthe reader has seen that for about 250 years it has been an object of\r\ninterest and of study among naturalists, and that first one and then\r\nanother has made fresh examinations of its various parts, giving to the\r\nworld new items of information as the results of such observations.\r\n\r\nAnd can there remain anything further to find out about it? we may\r\nask in surprise. Yes, there is. There yet remains to comprehend and\r\ndecide upon one feature which thus far has defeated conjecture and\r\ninvestigation—the ‘pit’ (p. 277). Possibly among the indefatigable\r\nobservers in the land of rattlesnakes, recent labours may have been\r\nrewarded by some new evidence of the utility of this peculiar orifice,\r\nand already their zoological journals may have enlightened ophiologists\r\non its functions. At the present moment I am not aware of such\r\ninformation; and time will not permit of further delay to enable me to\r\nsend a message of inquiry across the great deep.\r\n\r\nHitherto the pit has certainly plagued not only zoologists, but all\r\nclassifiers of the Ophidia; because serpents that have this facial\r\ndepression embrace so many widely differing genera, some of them\r\nresembling in all other respects the true vipers, and others the\r\nrattlesnakes, so that they have come to be distinguished as the ‘pit\r\nvipers.’\r\n\r\nOne of our most able biologists, A. R. Wallace, in his _Geographical\r\nDistribution of Animals_,[106] informs us that ‘the _Crotalidæ_,\r\nincluding the deadly rattlesnakes, abound most in the oriental regions’\r\n(though not a single rattlesnake is found there, or in the Old World at\r\nall). Let us seek for the reason of this apparent incongruity, and how\r\nit is that a large number of serpents which have no rattle come to be\r\nplaced among those which have an instrument specially constructed to\r\nproduce a rattling sound.\r\n\r\nNot to weary the reader by attempting to describe the various systems\r\nof classification adopted by the many herpetologists who were the\r\ncontemporaries and immediate successors of Linnæus, we will rather\r\ninvite his imagination to picture the geographical history of our\r\nglobe during that age. Travels, explorations, the establishment of\r\nnew colonies, and the settlement of new territories marked the era;\r\nand, as a sequence, new and hitherto unknown fauna were continually\r\nbrought home to Europe. We have seen, too, how natural history had been\r\ngrowing into a science, and how travellers and zoologists stimulated\r\neach other by their researches and writings. To recall a few of the\r\nnames with whom reptiles are associated, and to remind the reader that\r\none arranged them according to their scales, another their form, a\r\nfourth their teeth, a fifth their habits, and so on, and that even\r\nat the present day the classification of them is far from complete,\r\nthe present writer will be absolved from attempting anything beyond\r\ngeneralization.\r\n\r\nStudying snakes towards the end of the last century, were Laurenti,\r\nBuffon, Bonnat, Lacepède, Klein, Seba, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the present century were Latreille, Shaw,\r\nDaudin, Oppel, Merrem, Wagler, Neuwied, Cuvier, and many others till\r\nwe come to Gray, Fitzinger, and Dumeril, 1844. This last author, in\r\nhis introduction to _Les serpents solenoglyphes, dit Thanatophides_,\r\nincluding the most deadly snakes, devotes several pages to the subject\r\nof the ‘pit,’ and why it had especially occupied the attention of\r\nthose herpetologists who were endeavouring to improve the previously\r\nimperfect systems. Wagler in 1824 assigned the name _Bothrops_ (from\r\nβὀθρος, any hole, or pit, or hollow dug) to vipers with the pit that\r\nhad only scales and no plates or shields on their head, separating\r\nthese from the rattlesnakes and from those that have shields (see\r\nillus. p. 318). This nomenclature of Wagler’s did not commend itself to\r\nother herpetologists, and Fitzinger, in his _Systema Reptilium_, 1843,\r\nextending the group, retained the name for one of the five families\r\ninto which he divided all the venomous snakes. Fitzinger’s fifth\r\nfamily, the _Bothrophides_, included some of the Indian pit vipers; but\r\nas some of these latter have shields on their head, they could not be\r\nadmitted into Wagler’s group with scales only. As the present object is\r\nto demonstrate some of the perplexities of naturalists, and to arrive\r\nat the reason why so many snakes without the _crotalon_ are called\r\n_Crotalidæ_, we will quote Dumeril’s reasons, inviting the reader to\r\npicture to himself the interest with which new examples were brought\r\nhome for investigation, and the obstacles presenting themselves to\r\nherpetologists, who find one feature claiming alliance to this snake,\r\nwhile another feature points an alliance to an entirely opposite one.\r\n\r\nSo Dumeril shows us why some of the herpetologists wished to admit\r\n_every species that has the nasal fosse_ under the generic name\r\n_Bothrophidæ_, and others would have limited the term to a few, because\r\nthe name does not suit them all equally well. ‘_Beaucoup d’autres\r\nserpents presentent aussi des enfoncements creusés sur la tête et sur\r\nle bord des lèvres._’ These depressions, called by Professor Owen\r\n‘secreting follicles,’ may be easily distinguished on the upper lip\r\nof some of the larger constrictors. In the Reticulated python you can\r\ncount these pits like deep dimples round the mouth. In the Diamond\r\nsnake (_Morelia spilotes_) they are remarkably deep along the lower lip.\r\n\r\nOf those ‘follicles’ in the _Crotalidæ_ Dumeril writes: ‘_Les fossettes\r\nparaissent devoir être des organes particuliers dont l’usage ou la\r\nfonction n’est pas connu il est vraix, mais qui semble avoir quelque\r\nimportance par leur position constante entre les orifices réels des\r\nnarines et les yeux, at leur structure anatomique assez compliquée.\r\nÀ cause de la grande analogie qu’ils ont tous avec les serpents à\r\nsonnettes, nous avons preféré appeler ceux-ci les crotaliens._’[107]\r\n\r\nThe above words are under the head of ‘_Les Crotaliens_,’ a name\r\nretained, he had already explained why. ‘_Les solenoglyphes qui ont les\r\nnarines doubles en apparence seront pour nous les Crotaliens quoique\r\ncette dénomination puisse, à tort, porter à croire que ces espèces\r\nfont du bruit avec leur queue: elle indique seulement leur rapports\r\navec les crotales établis d’après la présence des fausses narines\r\nou fossettes dont nous venons de parler. On nomme quelquefois ces\r\nOphidiens Bothrops._’[108] ... ‘_Comme ce caractère conviendrait à tous\r\nles Crotaliens parcequ’ils ont tous des fossettes dites lacrymales, ce\r\nnom (Bothrops) deviant par conséquent trop général._’[109]\r\n\r\nIn retaining _Bothrops_ as a generic distinction, a large number of\r\nnon-venomous and constricting serpents must have been included, which\r\nprobably induced Wagler’s opposers to say of him that he ‘created a\r\nsystem in which the venomous and non-venomous were huddled together\r\npell mell.’\r\n\r\nThus we see that on account of the nasal fosse the Indian crotaline\r\nsnakes could not be true vipers; they could not be exclusively\r\n_Bothrophidæ_, for the reasons given above, and they certainly are not\r\nrattlesnakes; but for want of a better name they are ‘_Crotalidæ_,’ as\r\nthey have (minus the rattle) more features in common with rattlesnakes\r\nthan with any others.\r\n\r\nIn the slough of a rattlesnake you may see the form of this pit. It is\r\nlined with scales, and reversed in sloughing, perfectly shaped as a\r\ntiny glove finger.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. J. E. Gray, F.R.S., etc., edited a short-lived little magazine\r\nin 1831 called the _Zoological Miscellany_, the whole of the known\r\n_Crotalidæ_ consisted of ten genera and thirty species, of which\r\nsixteen species belonged to Asia and its adjacent islands, one to South\r\nAfrica, and the rest to America. When he published his catalogue of\r\nsnakes belonging to the British Museum in 1849, he enumerated eleven\r\ngenera and thirty-seven species. Wallace, 1876, gives eleven genera and\r\nforty species, the eastern examples of which belong to India, Siam,\r\nJava, Borneo, Tartary, Thibet, Japan, and Formosa. Still more recently\r\nsome belonging to the Western States of America have, I believe, been\r\nadded by Cope or Coues, the latter informing us that up to the date of\r\nhis paper, 1878, eighteen species and upwards of the rattlesnake proper\r\nhad been described in the United States, nearly all in the west and\r\nsouth-west. So, as those vast deserts are being explored, new species\r\nare continually discovered.\r\n\r\nOf the Indian species of _Crotalidæ_, those minus a rattle, Fayrer\r\nsays that they are chiefly in Malaya and Indo-China. Many of them,\r\nthe _Trimeresuri_, are arboreal, and like the foliage in colour. They\r\nhave the viperine aspect, but are ‘less formidable than their American\r\ncongeners,’ being of much smaller dimensions. Only one, _Halys_, has\r\nanything approaching to a rudimentary rattle, a tail ending in a spine.\r\nOf the _Trimeresuri_, the tree species, Fayrer affirms that few deaths\r\nare ascribed to them. Some attain to above three feet in length. He\r\nthinks a feeble person might die of their bite. They are of a sluggish\r\nhabit, and lie quietly hidden among the leaves of low bushes and ferns.\r\nThey will even suffer themselves to be moved without attempting to\r\nbite, but one that was pressed to the ground with a stick struck so\r\nhard as to break both its fangs. They feed chiefly on insects. Their\r\nhabits are crepuscular if not nocturnal, and Fayrer does not state\r\npositively that they or any of the Indian _Crotalidæ_ are viviparous.\r\n\r\nOf the principal American _Crotalidæ_ that are not true rattlesnakes,\r\nthe ‘Bushmaster’ (_Lachesis mutus_) stands first. This is undoubtedly\r\nthe largest venomous serpent known. In length it equals the Hamadryad;\r\nand in thickness, the large African vipers. On looking closely at the\r\nillustration of this reptile’s tail (p. 176), it will be seen that\r\nin addition to the spine which terminates it, there are several rows\r\nof fine, elaborated scales, which under the microscope appear almost\r\nas curiously pointed as those on the head of _Vipera nasicornis_.\r\nDumeril thus describes the tail: ‘_Ponctuée, et précédée de dix ou\r\ndouze rangées d’écailles épineuses, un peu courbées en crochets à\r\nla pointe._’ This is the snake called _Crotalus muet_, or ‘dumb\r\nrattlesnake,’ by Linnæus, and which is supposed to simulate the sound\r\nof the rattle by vibrating this point against the leaves; but many\r\nother snakes do this whether their tail is pointed or not, as we saw\r\nin chap. xi. Any small thing, such as a twig rustling among dead\r\nleaves, would produce the same sound. The near approach of _Lachesis_\r\nto _Crotalus horridus_ of the same habitat is, however, seen in this\r\nrudimentary rattle, the agitation of which may similarly be attributed\r\nto the timidity of these ‘highly nervous and irritable creatures,’ to\r\nrepeat Coues’ words; for deadly as they are, timidity strongly displays\r\nitself. Watching the venomous snakes when their food is dropped into\r\ntheir cages, their excessive caution, amounting to cowardice, is\r\nremarkable, and this with the rattlesnakes especially. One will fix\r\nits eyes on the rat which is running about, and shrink back terrified\r\nif it approach too closely. Then if the quadruped is a moment quiet,\r\nthe snake appears to be considering whether it will be advisable to\r\nattack it or not. Stealthily and slowly it approaches its head, but on\r\nthe slightest movement of the little animal, recedes in alarm, and is\r\nsome time before it makes a second venture. I have seen a rattlesnake\r\nthus timidly advancing and recoiling three or four times before it\r\nhas the courage to give the fatal stroke. Even after the bite it\r\nwatches its victim with a steadiness in which terror is the strongest\r\nexpression; and when the rat has remained motionless for a time, and\r\nthe rattlesnake ventures near to investigate and make sure it is\r\ndead, one faint gasp or dying struggle will cause the reptile to dart\r\nback in excessive alarm, and wait again some minutes before venturing\r\nnear. After long and patient observations, I am still doubtful whether\r\nstupidity or timidity predominates in viperine natures.\r\n\r\nOf the other well-known and formidable American _Crotalidæ_ is the\r\n‘_Fer de lance_’ (_Trigonocephalus lanceolatus_) of the Antilles\r\nand Central America. This has also a pointed tail. The Jararaca of\r\nGray (_Craspedocephalus Braziliensis_) is another, but without the\r\npoint. Of the true rattlesnakes, Dumeril gave five genera in 1844,\r\nviz. _Crotalophorus_, _Crotalus_, _Caudisona_, _Urocrotalon_, and\r\n_Urosophus_.\r\n\r\nFrom the two species originally known, we see how they have gradually\r\nmultiplied as the country has been more thoroughly explored. In 1860,\r\nDr. Weir Mitchel affirmed that twenty species had been then described;\r\nprobably the most recent ‘Reports’ or Bulletins will tell us of yet\r\nothers. And these latter are exclusive of the non-rattle-bearing\r\n_Crotalidæ_.\r\n\r\nDr. Mitchel’s experiments were with the northern species, chiefly\r\n_Cro. durissus_; and as a relief from this wearisome classification,\r\nsome of his observations will be welcome. One very noteworthy result\r\nis that the Crotalus does occasionally produce a sound independently\r\nof the rattle. Not a prolonged hiss, or by any means so loud as the\r\ninnocent snakes, but merely ‘the expiration of air from the lungs just\r\nbefore striking.’ I have never observed or heard this in our London\r\nrattlesnakes, but it no doubt is of the same character and degree of\r\nsound as that produced by the _Cerastes_ and the little _Echis_, and\r\nwhich more resembled a short, feeble, spitting sound. Still, as we are\r\ninformed by Dumeril that rattlesnakes are ‘deprived of voice,’ it is\r\ninteresting to know that, on the authority of Dr. Weir Mitchel, some\r\nslight sound, though not a regular hiss, does sometimes accompany the\r\naction of striking.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry has lately met the eye in one of our scientific journals\r\nas to whether a rattlesnake drinks. Dr. Mitchel clears away all\r\ndoubts on that subject by impressing upon those who keep these\r\ncreatures the importance of giving them plenty of water, particularly\r\nwhen changing the skin. Deprived of it, the cuticle comes off\r\nunhealthily—_desquamates_, in fact, in bits. At the casting of the\r\ncuticle, or previous to the process, they will not only drink, he tells\r\nus, but lie for hours in the water. When they were disinclined to eat,\r\nand had fasted long enough to endanger their health, he fed them by\r\nforce with milk and insects, and the way he managed was to get their\r\nmouths open and insert a tunnel a safe distance down their throat.\r\nWhile held in this position, a repast consisting of insects and milk\r\nwas pushed down the tube of the tunnel in sufficient quantities. The\r\nmost surprising circumstance in connection with this style of feeding,\r\nand also with the process adopted by Dr. Shortt of Madras in filling\r\nhis cobras ‘as full as they could hold’ with sour milk, is that these\r\nfastidious and frightened reptiles did not disgorge the diet. Both\r\nexperimentalists, however, found it answer, reminding us of some\r\nadvice given to the keeper at the London Ophidarium in the case of the\r\nHamadryad, which, having no snakes to dine off one winter, elected to\r\nfast. To force frogs or fish down its throat was suggested; but no one\r\ncould be found brave enough to undertake the task, and happily ‘Ophio’\r\nsurvived till a relay of ring snakes arrived.\r\n\r\nBoth Mitchel and Coues corroborate what has been observed by others\r\nregarding the increased virulence of the bite when moulting; but both\r\nare of opinion that this is owing to an accumulation of venom, as the\r\nsnakes have not been feeding or expending their store for some days.\r\nEven while not feeding, their venom is secreted all the same, and they\r\nsurvive many months, even a whole year and more, without food. Dumeril\r\nmentions one that lived twenty-five months without feeding.\r\n\r\nA startling and almost horrifying demonstration of what physiologists\r\nwould perhaps attribute to nervous or to muscular irritability is\r\ndescribed by Dr. Mitchel, namely, an action that had been begun in\r\nlife, carried out in a headless snake. On p. 281 was described the\r\nastonishment of Colonel Beverley, who observed the severed head of a\r\nrattlesnake attempting to bite. ‘Then the head gave a sudden champ.’\r\nLong after a snake is dead the tongue will be exserted as in life;\r\nand in other actions they, as it were, carry out their intentions\r\nthough deprived of vitality. ‘The headless trunk will strike,’ says Dr.\r\nMitchel, and continue to do this when touched or irritated as if it\r\nstill had its head and its fangs to strike with!\r\n\r\nMr. George Catlin in his _Life among the Indians_ relates a\r\ncircumstance of this kind which may well be introduced here, as\r\nillustrative of this amazing fact—a rattlesnake coiling and springing\r\nafter it is decapitated. His party were going down a river, and had\r\njust landed to explore a little, when he saw a large Crotalus, and\r\nseizing his gun fired at its head. At the same moment it leaped and\r\nsprang towards him, apparently striking him on the breast, Mr. Catlin\r\nbeing on the point of leaping back into the boat. He thought he had\r\nfired and missed his aim, and was a dead man, nevertheless much\r\nwondering at having missed his mark. Meantime, an Indian, seeing a spot\r\nof blood on the front of Mr. Catlin’s linen smock, exclaimed, ‘You are\r\nbitten!’ and without ceremony the smock and flannel shirt were torn\r\nopen, and a spot of blood on his breast was exposed to view. Promptly\r\nthe blood was washed off, and the Indian on his knees had his mouth\r\nat the wound preparing to suck out the poison. Quickly looking up,\r\nhowever, he rose to his feet, and with a smile of exultation said,\r\n‘There’s no harm! You’ll find the snake without its head.’\r\n\r\nStepping ashore again, and pushing aside the long grass, there, sure\r\nenough, was the headless rattlesnake, coiled up where it had fallen,\r\nand with its headless trunk erect, ready for another spring. Mr. Catlin\r\nhad _not_ missed fire, but the creature so near the spring, was so\r\nready at the instant with its aim made, that it leapt and struck Mr.\r\nCatlin probably on the very spot where it would have bitten him had the\r\nsportsman missed his mark. The bleeding trunk had printed its stroke\r\nwith blood, driving the stain through the dress to the skin. ‘How\r\ncurious it is,’ Mr. Catlin remarks at the conclusion of his narrative,\r\n‘that if you cut off the head of a rattlesnake, its body will live\r\nfor hours, and jump at you if you touch it with a stick, when if you\r\nbreak his spine near the tail, with even a feeble blow, it is dead in a\r\nminute. This we proved on several occasions.’\r\n\r\nMr. Catlin also helps to confirm what has been already stated in these\r\npages, viz. the certainty of the mate being within hearing of the\r\nrattle, and responding when one of them sounds an alarm; also that\r\n‘they can track each other and never lose company, though when met are\r\nnot always seen together, so that if we kill one over-night and leave\r\nits dead body, the other will be found by its side in the morning.’\r\n\r\nA near relative of the rattlesnake is the ‘copper-head,’\r\n_Trigonocephalus contortrix_ of the United States, known also as the\r\n‘Red adder,’ and the ‘Dumb rattlesnake.’ It is the _Boa contortrix_ of\r\nLinnæus, who, as we explained above, and also in chap. ii., divided the\r\nOphidia into only three or four families, calling an immense number,\r\nboth venomous and harmless, ‘boas.’\r\n\r\nThis member of the _Crotalidæ_ is said to be as venomous as the\r\nrattlesnake, and is much more dreaded, because it has no rattle to give\r\nwarning of its proximity. When a bitten person survives, the effects\r\nof its bite are said to be felt annually, as in the case of the\r\nrattlesnake, and the injured limb ‘turns the colour of the snake.’ In\r\nregard to this latter symptom, said to show itself in the case of so\r\nmany snakes, the bitten limb assumes all manner of horrible tints in\r\nmost cases, and it does not require a great stretch of imagination to\r\ndetect colours resembling the also many-tinted aggressors. Still there\r\nmay be more in this than we at present know of.\r\n\r\nIn the cranberry swamps and tamarack marshes in the northern districts\r\nof Ohio formerly were found immense numbers of a small and very\r\ndark brown rattlesnake known as the _Massasauga_. It is seen lying\r\nin clusters like small twigs on dry leaves, and still is found in\r\nconsiderable numbers in some remote districts. The illustration of the\r\nsmall rattle (p. 302) was sent me from that neighbourhood, and is, I\r\nbelieve, from a true ‘Massasauga.’ This is the one (as I think I am\r\nsafe in stating) that was first (1810) described by Dr. Kirtland, a\r\ndistinguished naturalist of Ohio, and after him named _Crotalophorus\r\nKirtlandi_. Its range is confined to the swampy districts of Northern\r\nOhio and Southern Michigan. Its rattle being scarcely audible,\r\nthis little snake gets frequently trodden upon, and persons are as\r\nfrequently bitten; but Dr. Kirtland stated that he had never known any\r\none to die of its bite, which is scarcely worse than the sting of a\r\nhornet. It is a link between the last-named snake, the ‘copper-head,’\r\nand the rattlesnake, having head-shields like the former, and tail of\r\nthe latter. These small species no doubt help to add to the confusion\r\nof evidence regarding the virulence of rattlesnake bites, one person\r\naffirming that they are deadly, and another, that recovery is common.\r\nThe degree of venom between the smallest and the largest of the\r\n_Crotalidæ_ can no more be compared than can the constriction of\r\nthe little slow-worm round your fingers with the constriction of the\r\nanaconda.\r\n\r\nA word in conclusion about the rattlesnake’s enemies; and of these hogs\r\ncome first, next to man. Wild hogs, peccaries, and deer in their native\r\nhaunts, and doubtless an immense number of snake-eating birds, devour\r\nyoung rattlesnakes. Deer strike them with their hoofs, jumping on them\r\nwith wonderful adroitness, so as to pin them down with all four feet.\r\nPigs in the west derive no small part of their subsistence from snakes;\r\nand, as is now a well-known fact, the introduction of hogs has done\r\nmore than anything else—not even excepting the annual _battue_—to\r\ndiminish the number of rattlesnakes. The venom being ‘innocuous to\r\nhogs,’ is a fact only partially stated. A thin hog, bitten on a vein,\r\nmight die as speedily as any other victim. It is because the venom\r\nfails to penetrate the fat, or, as Dr. Coues more ably expresses it,\r\n‘the fluid fails to enter the circulation through the layer of adipose\r\ntissue.’ Pigs are not invariably exempt, any more than is the mongoose,\r\nfrom the cobra’s bite. In both cases adroitness assists the animals to\r\nevade the strike, and in the latter case the thick fur of the mongoose\r\nis as great a protection to it as the fat is to the hog.\r\n\r\nDr. Coues mentions a danger not often anticipated in dealing with\r\nrattlesnakes when you wish to examine them. This is their habit of\r\ntwining themselves around the arm, or wherever they can get hold.\r\n‘Grasp it fearlessly at the back of the neck,’ he says; ‘but even then\r\na large one can constrict enough to paralyze both arms.’ A man who was\r\nthus trammelled had to be relieved by a bystander. We are not always\r\nprepared for constricting rattlesnakes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n_THE XENODONS._\r\n\r\n_AND MY ‘DISCOVERY.’_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGH there are only about eight species that have a legitimate\r\nright to this patronymic, there are—as my readers have seen in chap.\r\nxix.—great numbers of ‘strange-toothed’ snakes that have a zoological,\r\nor rather a dentitional right to it. The present chapter, however,\r\nwill comprise only a few of those most nearly allied to the recognised\r\n_Xenodons_, which with _Heterodon_ must occupy some pages.\r\n\r\nThe _Xenodons_ have an especial interest, not only on account of their\r\nremarkable dentition, but their vernacular names, which in Brazil,\r\nwhere these snakes are common, have led to much and frequent confusion.\r\nThis can be remedied only after considerable lapse of time, for the\r\nconfusion has unfortunately been disseminated in print, and the\r\nvernaculars, confused by local prejudices, still obtain. The incident\r\nof my own first acquaintance with a _Xenodon_ will in part explain the\r\nkind of puzzle which prevails; and a little personal gossip about this\r\nmay, I trust, be tolerated.\r\n\r\nA snake mentioned by a number of writers and travellers as the\r\n_Jararaca_ had plagued me long and terribly, from the contradictory\r\naccounts of it. What _is_ this Jararaca? And is it the same as the\r\n_Iarraracca_ or the _Ibiracua_ or the _Iraracuassa_ or the _Shiraraca_,\r\nor several other nearly similar names which appear in books about\r\nBrazil. Had one gone straight to Gray or Dumeril, the recognised and\r\nscientific name for it could have been ascertained at once; but we do\r\nnot so readily find out which _are_ the right books to pounce upon,\r\nnor had I in those days learnt the necessity of trusting to scientific\r\nworks only for the unravelling of travellers’ tales; but I hunted in\r\ndictionaries and encyclopedias and travels and those old authors again,\r\nbut with no better success.\r\n\r\nIn Wallace’s _Travels in the Amazon_ we read: ‘Hanging up under\r\nthe eaves of our shed was a dried head of a snake which had been\r\nkilled a short time before. It was a _Jaráraca_, a species of\r\n_Craspedocephalus_, and must have been of formidable size, for its\r\npoison fangs, four in number, were nearly an inch long.... The bite of\r\nsuch would be certain death.’\r\n\r\nWith this picture of a large Brazilian serpent, drawn by such an\r\nauthority as Wallace, one read in Ogilvy’s dictionary: ‘_Jararaca_.\r\nA species of serpent in America, seldom exceeding eighteen inches in\r\nlength; having prominent veins on the head, and of a dusky, brownish\r\ncolour, variegated with red and black spots.’\r\n\r\nThen Webster—evidently from the same source: ‘A species of serpent\r\nin America,’—word for word the same as far as the black spots—‘very\r\npoisonous. Native name in Surinam.’ And in a newer edition, Webster, in\r\naddition, gives its scientific name, _Bothrops Jararaca_; and that it\r\nis ‘a native to (_sic_) Brazil.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! if a _Bothrops_, then it is one of the _Crotalidæ_,’ was\r\nthe decision arrived at. Kingsley, in his _At Last_, mentions a\r\n‘mangrove snake, much dreaded by being so like the deadly Cascobel,\r\nviz. _Trigonocephalus jararaca_.’ Thus with our puzzle we combine a\r\n_Bothrops_ with the ‘pit;’ a _Trigonocephalus_ with the worst of the\r\nviperine heads; and according to Wallace, a _Craspedocephalus_, which,\r\nat a guess, must be that it has something rough about the head to\r\nentitle it to this specific.\r\n\r\nFew of the encyclopedias described it individually, or threw more light\r\nupon it. Worcester’s dictionary states that the Jararaca is ‘a species\r\nof venomous American serpent seldom exceeding eighteen inches;’ and\r\ngives Wright as an authority. Spix and Martin[110] in their list of\r\nvenomous snakes describe _Jararacucu_, called also _Shiraraca_, as a\r\n_Bothrops_; and also a _Jararaca mirim_, a small one. Marcgravius[111]\r\nfigures a _Iararaca_, a small snake of a bright red with black spots.\r\n\r\nAnd now for our old friend the Pilgrim Purchas. ‘Of snakes that have\r\nPoison, _Iararaca_ is a Name that comprehendeth foure kinds. The first\r\nis the greatest _J_. There are other smaller _Jararacas_, about half a\r\nYard long. They have certaine Veines in their Head like the Vipers.’\r\n\r\nHave those ‘prominent veins anything to do with its name\r\n_Craspedocephalus_’? But how about its being only eighteen inches?\r\nThis was the pursuit of snakes under difficulties, the clearing away\r\nof which was accomplished only by slow degrees, as one book after\r\nanother offered new contradictions with still other varieties of\r\nspelling. Without doubt this perplexing reptile was viperine, rough,\r\nangular-headed, crotaline, and probably hideous; but as for colouring\r\nthere were many doubts about that.\r\n\r\nAfter several years’ familiarity with the _name_ of this puzzling\r\n‘Jararaca,’ and curiosity increasing at a corresponding ratio, the\r\nreader can imagine the effect produced by unexpectedly seeing at the\r\nLondon Zoological Gardens one day in September 1880 a new label to\r\none of the cages in the Ophidarium thus inscribed, ‘CRASPEDOCEPHALUS\r\nBRAZILIENSIS. THE JARRARACCA. Presented by Dr. Stradling.’\r\n\r\nA live Jararaca at last! Now we shall know all about it.\r\n\r\nBut how is this? The serpent before me was not a viper, not\r\nrough-headed, not a _Bothrops_, because it had only one pair\r\nof nostrils. It had smooth, polished scales, large, beautiful,\r\nround eyes, with no ‘red spots’ and not a spice of venom or of\r\nviperishness about it. And I stood staring and wondering, and—I must\r\nconfess—_disappointed_ at this meek-looking, smallish snake being a\r\nrepresentative of the terrible, ‘formidable’ picture that had been\r\nconjured up. ‘I don’t believe that’s a _Jararaca_!’ were my inward\r\nconclusions. ‘I am _sure_ it isn’t! It _can’t_ be. It does not agree\r\nin any way.’ Then came the keeper to the cage, to tell me of this\r\nnew and valuable addition; but I only repeated aloud my already firm\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\n‘Here’s the gentleman who brought it from Brazil, and he ought to\r\nknow,’ returned the keeper in justifiable argument as he motioned\r\nwith his hand towards a stranger by his side. The name of Dr. Arthur\r\nStradling, a Corresponding Member of the Zoological Society, was\r\nalready known to me. Though personally unacquainted, he had, indeed,\r\nthrough the columns of _Land and Water_, replied to some communications\r\nof my own. This informal introduction, therefore, led easily to the\r\nexchange of a few words about this contradictory ‘Jararaca,’ the\r\nname by which—as he assured me—the snake was known in Brazil. He\r\nhad not, he said, examined the mouth of this snake during the voyage\r\nhome, knowing its deadly character; and had simply accepted it as the\r\n‘Jarraracca,’ according to its Brazilian vernacular. I ventured to\r\npoint out the non-viperine aspect of the so-called ‘deadly’ reptile\r\nbefore us, and suggested that if it were indeed venomous it could only\r\nbe an elaps, also that there were probably several that were known by\r\nthis name. This led to a correspondence, both by letter and through the\r\ncolumns of _Land and Water_ (Oct. 1880), on the subject of vernacular\r\nnames; but as these belong more especially to the ensuing chapter, I\r\nneed only say here that Dr. Stradling returned to Brazil determined\r\nto investigate this confusion of names, and I thus gained a valuable\r\nally in my endeavours to identify some of the perplexing vernaculars of\r\nBrazil with the scientific descriptions.\r\n\r\nOn a subsequent voyage, Dr. Stradling obtained three more of these\r\nso-called Jararacas, and described them by letter, and subsequently in\r\n_Land and Water_.\r\n\r\nEchoing my own perplexities, he asks, ‘_Is_ there such a snake as the\r\n_Jarraracca_? When I got three more living specimens of the same this\r\nlast voyage in Pernambuco, I began to have my doubts, for I could not\r\nreconcile them with the description at all. One died, which fact I did\r\nnot, by ill luck, discover till it was worthless; but I observed, as\r\nI thought, a well-developed fang. A few days later a good opportunity\r\npresented itself for picking up one of the survivors and examining its\r\nmouth; then to my surprise I found that the supposed fang was really\r\na large curved tooth, situated quite out of the natural position of a\r\nfang, but symmetric with one on the opposite side. Then I looked at\r\nthe other one, and finally let both bite me, which settled the matter.\r\nI set it down as _Xenodon_ (a harmless snake), and was gratified to\r\nfind on reaching home that Dr. Günther had pronounced my specimen\r\nat the Gardens’ (the one brought the previous September) ‘_Xenodon\r\nrhabdocephalus_, the long-headed snake, on its death. But I don’t find\r\nany mention of this extraordinary isolated tooth anywhere, though I\r\nhave a vague idea that Dr. Wucherer, who has perhaps been the most\r\nearnest student of the Brazilian Thanatophidia, spoke of it in a\r\ncommunication to the Society some years ago. The real “Jarraracca”\r\nis still veiled in mystery.’ I also was ‘gratified’ to find the\r\nCorresponding Member of the Zoological Society so generously justifying\r\nmy doubts about the supposed _Jararaca_, both in his letter to me and\r\nin a paper to _Land and Water_, 2d April 1881.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time I had ever heard of a _Xenodon_, a name which\r\nDr. Günther was then so good as to explain meant ‘strange tooth;’\r\nand he drew a little diagram of the jaw with five simple teeth\r\ncurving back, and then a long, fang-like back tooth. Strange indeed!\r\n_Heterodon_ I knew possessed a large, fang-like tooth, which had caused\r\nit to be called ugly names. Now here is more heterodox dentition.\r\n\r\nDr. Wucherer’s account of the _Xenodon_ was discovered in the\r\n_Zoological Society Proceedings_ for 1861. He also had been a\r\nC.M.Z.S.[112] in the same region, and his report of the curious\r\n_Xenodon rhabdocephalus_ is that it is very voracious, feeding chiefly\r\non frogs, but will swallow his friend too, should the latter have hold\r\nof one on which he has set his heart. It flattens itself remarkably,\r\nand thus gets through a very narrow chink. It is a fresh-water snake,\r\ncalled _Cobra d’aqua_ in Brazil, also _Surucucu_ (from its evil\r\nreputation). But Dr. Wucherer says not a word of those fang-like teeth.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Dr. Stradling had most kindly sent me the magnificent\r\nspecimen of ‘_Curucucu_’ (_Lachesis mutus_), in spirits; and this,\r\ntogether with the investigation of certain other vernaculars, made\r\nthe _Xenodon_ of only secondary interest in our correspondence until\r\nexactly six months afterwards, when, on landing, June 1881, he wrote\r\nthat he was sending a _Heterodon_ and another _Xenodon_ to the Gardens.\r\n\r\n‘Where are the new snakes?’ I asked the keeper, hurrying to the\r\nReptilium early next day.\r\n\r\n‘What new snakes, ma’am? There are none fresh since you were last here.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, well, they are coming! Most _interesting_ kinds. I shall wait for\r\nthem.’\r\n\r\nSure enough, ere long a boy was seen approaching from the office with a\r\n‘box of snakes.’ He also brought the news that the Doctor was expected\r\n‘directly.’\r\n\r\nConsigned to their cage, how I hovered about those ‘strange-toothed’\r\nColubers that long midsummer day! How I wished they would bring their\r\nheads close to the glass and yawn the widest of yawns, and how I waited\r\nfor the ophiological dentist to come and exhibit their ‘fangs!’ for the\r\ndonor of these valuable acquisitions had been devoting himself to the\r\ndiscovery of antitoxics, and was supposed to be snake-proof, and to do\r\nwhat he pleased with both venomous and non-venomous kinds. But the long\r\nmidsummer day waxed on, and I gazed at the _Xenodon_ till I knew every\r\nmark of his leaf-like pattern; and the day began to wane, and my hopes\r\nof seeing the wonderful teeth began to wane also. And I felt I had a\r\nsort of claim upon this _Xenodon_, the ‘Jarraracca’ about which we had\r\ncorresponded.\r\n\r\nI had relied so much on having the pseudo-fangs scientifically\r\ndisplayed to me, that when the visitors were departing and the keeper\r\nwas at liberty, I told him about these strange teeth which I was so\r\nanxious to see, and at last persuaded him to open _Xenodon’s_ mouth for\r\nme, and to hold it open (which operation the keepers understand very\r\nwell) while I made the dental examination myself.\r\n\r\nAfter all there was nothing in the shape of a fang to be seen!\r\n\r\n‘Posterior tooth long, compressed’! ‘Last tooth very long, compressed,\r\nensiform’! and so on, said the authorities; but nothing of the kind\r\nwas here! I could see to its very throat, and the rows of tiny palate\r\nteeth and the four rows of jaw teeth, all exceedingly small, but never\r\na fang. So I stared and wondered, and then in my bewildered amazement\r\nand vexation I passed my little finger along the jaws and _felt_ the\r\nupper teeth.\r\n\r\nThis practical investigation no doubt greatly offended the imprisoned\r\npatient, for suddenly down came a pair of regular fangs—they _looked_\r\nlike fangs;—and as my finger pressed the jaw on one or on the other\r\nside, I saw these fang-like teeth move, vibrate, exactly like the\r\nviperine fangs. When my finger was removed, up they went, folded back\r\nin their sheath in true viperine fashion. My finger got a slight prick,\r\nfor they were exceedingly sharp; but knowing there was no venom in\r\nthem, that did not concern me, and in a few minutes the sensation was\r\ngone. But how was it that Dr. Stradling had made no mention of this\r\nextraordinary viperine mobility of the fangs? And what kind of jaw\r\nmust a snake have to move its back teeth in this manner! For we saw in\r\nthe previous chapters that the mobility of the fangs is in proportion\r\nto the diminishing length of the maxillary bone, that the excessive\r\nmobility of the viperine fang is owing to the greatly reduced size\r\nof that bone, that a slight mobility is observable where the jaw is\r\nsomewhat less reduced, and so on; but here is a harmless Coluber with\r\na jaw long enough to hold five or six fixed, simple teeth, and then an\r\nextremely mobile long one at the back. Can the jaw be divided in the\r\nmiddle? Thus I marvelled.\r\n\r\n‘Now let us look at Heterodon.’\r\n\r\nBut that pretty little snake positively refused to open its mouth; so,\r\nfearing to alarm it, or cause it to disgorge its last meal, I did not\r\nencourage its forcible detention.\r\n\r\nNot to lose a moment, I then and there pencilled a note to Dr.\r\nStradling, begging him to tell me if he had observed anything unusual\r\nin _Xenodon’s_ ‘fangs.’ That I had examined them and seen what appeared\r\nvery extraordinary; but before describing it, was desirous of having my\r\nobservations confirmed by him.\r\n\r\nBut the Dr. had been unexpectedly appointed to another ship, which\r\nwould sail immediately. Many weeks must, therefore, elapse before his\r\nreply could reach me.\r\n\r\nThat day there was but one direction to which my ophidian compass\r\ndirected my steps, viz. the British Museum; and several days were spent\r\nthere hunting every possible book to find any mention of _Xenodon’s_\r\nmoveable teeth, but in vain. Surely a feature so exceptional would have\r\nbeen described had it been observed. Pardon, kind reader, these many\r\nwords about ‘so small an affair;’ but you who are naturalists know\r\nthe peculiar charm of finding ‘something new,’ producing, as Charles\r\nKingsley described, ‘emotions not unmixed with awe,’ that among the\r\nhappy memories of study or of travel ‘stand out as beacon points.’ It\r\nwas my great ambition to add ‘something new’ to science. But here was\r\nI with a secret ‘discovery,’ and not knowing what to do with it. And\r\n‘if anything should happen’ to _Xenodon_ meanwhile! Then the keeper\r\nwould be reprimanded. Plainly, courtesy demanded that the secretary\r\nof the London Zoological Society should receive an explanation of my\r\ninfringement of rules; therefore, in a letter to him, I described\r\n_Xenodon’s_ whole history. I also wrote a detailed account of _Xenodon_\r\nto a friend who edited a zoological publication, under the delusion\r\nthat I should be invited to contribute a full, true, and particular\r\naccount of these wonderful teeth to half the zoological journals of\r\nEurope! ‘First observed by C. C. H.!’ But no!\r\n\r\nWeeks of wondering suspense passed by. Then everybody went ‘out\r\nof town.’ On meeting Dr. Günther one day at the British Museum, I\r\ntold him what I had seen. ‘The teeth or the jaw moves?’ he asked\r\ncatechetically. That I could not explain, as it was precisely what one\r\nwished to ascertain. ‘You must dissect that snake,’ he said, adding\r\nthat he had had no time to examine it yet. All this was duly reported\r\nto my Brazilian correspondent, who with a generous impulse promised\r\nto send me ‘the very first _Xenodon_’ he got. Alas! as I told him,\r\nit was useless to give it to _me_, who could neither kill nor cut\r\nup snakes. He did not inform me whether he, also, had observed any\r\nmobility in the ‘fangs;’ so I could not yet flatter myself that I had\r\n‘added to science’ in any way. Professor Halford, when in England,\r\nhad dissected the head of the dead specimen at the Zoological Gardens\r\n(the supposed _Jarraracca_) for poison glands, but of course found\r\nnone; and I trusted to some scientific friend ‘happening by’ who would\r\nfurther examine its maxillary bone and report to me; but ophiological\r\nanatomists do not present themselves every day. Dr. Stradling was\r\nabsent; so unless other enthusiasts proceed to an examination before\r\nthis page meets the public eye, there will still remain these\r\n‘strange-toothed’ maxillaries inviting dissection.\r\n\r\nDr. Stradling, however, after a while informed me that he had _not_\r\nobserved the mobility of the fangs, nor had he seen any mention of such\r\nanywhere excepting in my paper to _Land and Water_ (July 9, 1881).\r\nHe thought those pseudo-fangs ‘of considerable importance in bearing\r\non the experiments that were then being carried on in Brazil with\r\npermanganate of potash, and particularly should a non-ophiologist be\r\nthe experimenter.’ A snake is brought as a ‘Jararaca,’ a name applied\r\nby the authorities to one of the very deadly viperine snakes. This\r\nsnake—the so-called ‘Jararaca’—bears an evil character. It has\r\nalso very suspicious-looking ‘fangs.’ It bites an animal which is\r\nput under treatment, and though requiring no treatment whatever, a\r\nsupposed ‘antidote’ might get all the credit of a ‘cure.’ He did not\r\nfor a moment infer that such had been the case in Brazil with those\r\nscientific experimentalists, but only what might be in consequence\r\nof the confusion in names. And the correspondence on this subject\r\nthat appeared in the papers during the latter part of October 1881\r\ncertainly did betray some confusion between the various _Jararacas_ and\r\n_Jararacucus_ that had inflicted bites.\r\n\r\nDr. Stradling had also looked in the mouth of the dead specimen of\r\n_Xenodon rhabdocephalus_, and he informed me that one of the ‘fangs’\r\ncame out in his hand. ‘It did not break off,’ he wrote; ‘and its\r\narticulation with the bone, if any, must be loose and ligamentous.’ I\r\nmust not presume to offer any opinion about its ‘articulation,’ except\r\nthat its being ‘loose’ might be only in consequence of a new tooth\r\npushing it out, or that it was about to fall out of itself. My readers\r\nwill unite in thanking Dr. Stradling for considerately forwarding me\r\nthis ‘fang,’ which so conveniently detached itself in time to be added\r\nto the rest of the illustrations, fig. _e_, presented on p. 360. It\r\nwill be observed that it is a stouter and less symmetrical tooth than\r\nthe true fangs; but it was very large in proportion to the simple\r\nteeth in the same jaw and on the palate, and which are not bigger than\r\nthe palate teeth seen behind the recumbent fangs of _Daboia_, p. 349.\r\n\r\nOf these true _Xenodons_ there are eight species; but the\r\nstrange-toothed group includes _Tomodon_, _Heterodon_, _Simotes_,\r\n_Liophis_, and several others that have large posterior teeth, some of\r\nwhich are grooved, others not, but all without a poison gland.\r\n\r\nSearching page after page about _Xenodon_, something one day suddenly\r\ncaught my eye that had hitherto escaped notice. In his _Odontography_,\r\nOwen, describing the South African snakes _Bucephali_, says: ‘Their\r\nlong grooved fangs are firmly fixed to the maxillary bone, _or are\r\nslightly moveable_ according to their period of growth; they are\r\nconcealed by a sheath of thick, soft gum, containing loose, recumbent,\r\ngrooved teeth ready to succeed those in place.’\r\n\r\n‘So, then, a mobile tooth was already known to science.’ Of _Bucephali\r\nviridis_, Dr. Andrew Smith describes the ‘posterior or _mobile_ and\r\ngrooved teeth of the maxilla.’ He says: ‘Some are placed for immediate\r\nuse, the rest are recumbent between those and the inner portion of the\r\nspongy sheath which envelops them; anterior teeth fixed.’ He considered\r\nthese back teeth not poisonous, but only for holding or preventing the\r\nescape of food. ‘They may convey an acrid saliva.’ Still we are not\r\ninformed _how_ the teeth move.[113]\r\n\r\nThese snakes—the Bucephali—like the far-famed horse of Alexander\r\nthe Great, owe their name to their large, ox-shaped head. They are\r\nthe ‘Boomslange’ or tree snake of the Dutch settlers, and are by some\r\nophiologists included among the _Dendrophidæ_, or true tree snakes,\r\nas they live in trees; but Dr. Andrew Smith considers that their teeth\r\nsufficiently separate them from these.\r\n\r\nThat there is something exceedingly interesting to study out in the\r\n_Xenodon_ family cannot be doubted. ‘The transition begun in the\r\nBucephali,’ says Owen,[114] ‘is completed in the poisonous serpents,’\r\nbut where the virulent character of the saliva begins it is hard to say.\r\n\r\nDespairing of any distinct comprehension of a jaw-bone which permits of\r\nmoveable back teeth, the last resource was to hunt up a skeleton. At\r\nthe Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons none was to be found; but\r\nthrough the kindness of the officials at the British Museum, one was at\r\nlength unearthed from the subterranean labyrinths of untold treasures\r\nthere. It was the skull of _X. gigas_, the largest of the family, and\r\na splendid specimen for examination. There were two large posterior\r\nfangs on each side. On one side were two or three more large reserve\r\nfangs—a cluster of them. All were recumbent. They were all much larger\r\nthan that of _X. rhabdocephalus_, those in reserve varying in size\r\nrelatively to their development and position. In this specimen there\r\nwere also two double rows of palate teeth, and an abundant but most\r\ndisorderly row of simple teeth in the lower jaw, with some reserve ones\r\npacked closely on the inner side below the row in use. They exactly\r\nillustrated the words of Nicholson and others, ‘the crop of young teeth\r\neverywhere working their way into the intervals of the old ones.’\r\n\r\nIn the skulls of _Liophis meremii_ and _Liophis cobella_, of which Dr.\r\nWucherer says, ‘Dentition similar to Xenodon,’ the former had teeth\r\ngradually increasing a trifle posteriorly, but nothing like fangs. _L.\r\ncobella_ had a very long jaw of fifteen or sixteen teeth, but no fangs.\r\n\r\nOn a second occasion I made a dental examination of the living\r\n_Xenodon_ in order to be fully convinced of the nature of its back\r\nteeth, and in both instances the fangs were depressed until the snake\r\nwas provoked into displaying them. It exhibited no spitefulness or\r\nattempt to bite, and in both cases folded back its fangs the moment my\r\nfinger was removed, as if glad that the ceremony was over.\r\n\r\n_Heterodon d’Orbignyi_, being a small and delicate snake, was not again\r\nenticed to exhibit its jaws; but my forbearance was otherwise rewarded.\r\nOne day it was dining off a rather large frog, and its mouth, close\r\nto the glass, was stretched open to its fullest extent. The frog had\r\ndisappeared so far as to be within the mouth, wedging it wide open; and\r\nI then saw a fang well erected and in use, _moving_, being detached,\r\nin fact, from the food. It appeared to be somewhat nearer to the front\r\nthan _Xenodon’s_ fangs, with perhaps only three or four simple teeth\r\nbefore it. But that it was a sheathed fang and _mobile_ I have no doubt\r\nwhatever, having seen it very distinctly. I told Tyrrell at the time\r\nthat _Heterodon’s_ fangs were also moveable; but now for the first\r\ntime I impart this new secret to the public. _Xenodon_ also greedily\r\nseizes upon inconveniently large frogs, but it has never displayed its\r\nfangs to me while feeding, as the pretty little _Heterodon_ did. One\r\nmore singular thing did this little _Heterodon_, and that was to assist\r\nitself by coiling its body round an unmanageable frog one day. It\r\ndid not regularly constrict it in order to kill it; but _when caught_\r\nin the mouth, it helped itself to restrain the straggling limbs by a\r\nfew coils. Dr. Wucherer affirms that he had never seen its congeners\r\n_Liophis_ or _Xenodon_ squeeze or coil themselves round their prey, but\r\n_Heterodon d’Orbignyi_ certainly does.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of the American _Heterodons_ is that of flattening\r\ntheir heads and the upper part of the body when angry or molested. It\r\nis this, together with their pseudo-fangs, that have procured them the\r\nname of ‘spread-head,’ ‘spreading-adder’, ‘puffing-adder’ or ‘blowing\r\nviper’,—because at the same time they hiss violently,—or simply ‘the\r\nadder,’ and ‘_blausser_,’ or the blower.\r\n\r\nThere are several species of them, all, with the exception of _H.\r\nd’Orbignyi_, having undeniably ugly, viperish-looking heads, ‘_Anguis\r\ncapitæ viperino_,’ or ‘_Serpent à la tête de vipère_.’ The snout\r\nterminates in a large, conspicuous, recurved scale which gives them a\r\npug-nosed or rather a hog-nosed appearance. Catesby, who was the first\r\nto describe the ‘hog-nosed snake,’ said ‘it hath a visage terrible and\r\nugly.’ In _H. niger_ and _H. platirhinos_ this is most apparent. They\r\nbelong mostly to the New World, both north and south. One in Virginia\r\nis called, from its bright markings, the ‘calico snake,’ the word\r\ncalico in America being applied chiefly to coloured prints used for\r\ndresses. Another is called ‘the mountain moccasin,’ the latter name in\r\nthe United States being applied to venomous kinds.\r\n\r\nIn the flattening of the head and body, _Xenodon_ and _Heterodon_\r\napproach the cobras; in the strange dentition they approach the vipers;\r\nin their true nature they are harmless colubers: thus do we see the\r\nwonderful links or gradations between opposite families, which have\r\nbeen such a perplexity to the early naturalist.\r\n\r\nThe _Heterodons_ have the reputation of ‘feigning death’ when annoyed.\r\nThis peculiarity has been commented on by many who have experimented\r\nupon the snake for this purpose. Holbrooke observed it in _H.\r\nplatirhinos_, and came to the conclusion that it was done at will.\r\n‘It will deceive its tormentor by feigning death, remaining flat and\r\nmotionless.’ It otherwise ‘flattens the head and upper part of the\r\nneck, which it lifts and waves, hissing loudly.’ This is the true cobra\r\nmanner. He often worried it and tried to make it bite, when it only\r\nprojected its head in that menacing way, but with closed mouth. On\r\nthe contrary, other experimentalists describe it with widely expanded\r\njaws when thus annoyed. In an excellent American magazine, _Science\r\nNews_, the _Heterodons_ formed the subject of several papers a few\r\nyears ago. To my friend, Mr. J. E. Harting, I am indebted for some\r\nnumbers of _Science News_, in which _Heterodons’_ performances are\r\nfully described. One, on being intercepted in its retreat, ‘threw its\r\nhead back with widely expanded jaws; but instead of striking, it turned\r\ncompletely over on its back, remaining stiff and motionless, with jaws\r\nfixed in rigid expansion, feigning death.’ Reptilian intellect was,\r\nhowever, insufficient to carry out the feint, inasmuch as its full\r\nmuscular power was exercised to maintain its position. ‘On concealing\r\nmyself,’ continues the narrator, ‘it cautiously righted itself and made\r\noff; but only to repeat the _ruse_ when again caught.’[115] Dr. J.\r\nSchneck, in the March number for the same year, describes a similar\r\naction on his worrying them with a switch, when, after making futile\r\nefforts to attack, they would seem to bite themselves (which they\r\nreally never do), and then turn on their backs as if dead. After a\r\nfew moments of quiet they would turn over and beat a hasty retreat.\r\nSeveral other writers in _Science News_ confirm Holbrooke’s experience,\r\nthat ‘under no provocation can it be induced to bite.’ Those we have\r\nseen at the Gardens verify this; exhibiting an extremely inoffensive\r\nnature, though no death-feigning or summersault performances. And I\r\nam more inclined to attribute the rigidity to a sort of paralyzed\r\nterror than to any pretence of being dead. The same thing is observed\r\nin some insects. If you blow on them or alarm them, they will flatten\r\nthemselves against whatever they may be crawling on, and cling close\r\nand stiff as if dead, but presently escape. Some other snakes, also,\r\nas well as the _Heterodons_, keep rigidly still as if paralyzed when\r\nmolested, previous to attempting any escape, though I do not remember\r\nany others that turn over on their backs in so singular a fashion.\r\n\r\nA few more words about the _Deirodon_ with its still stranger teeth\r\nmust come in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n_OPHIDIAN NOMENCLATURE AND VERNACULARS._\r\n\r\n\r\nIN a lecture on ‘Chameleons’ at the Zoological Gardens, Professor\r\nSt. George Mivart described in his peculiarly lucid, facile manner,\r\nsome of the features possessed in common by totally different\r\nzoological families, and facetiously added, ‘It is tiresome how a\r\nsingle species will come and interfere with our nice definitions in\r\nclassification.’[116] I will devote a chapter to the confusion arising\r\nfrom some such mixed features.\r\n\r\nIn the classification of the Ophidia these tiresome complications\r\npresent themselves more, perhaps, than in any other creatures. We\r\nhave seen how snakes of entirely opposite families may possess one\r\nsingle feature in common and differ in other generic respects; as, for\r\ninstance, in the moveable but innocuous fang of the _Xenodons_; in\r\nthose ‘pits’ or depressions in the face; the viperine form of head;\r\nthe position and number of head-shields; the sub-caudal plates, and so\r\non; and in such resemblances I am strongly inclined to suspect that\r\nthere are other interfering causes than a common ancestry, though this,\r\nno doubt, has much to do with it.\r\n\r\n‘What is to prevent our having one fixed name, and keeping to it?’\r\nexclaim the sorely-puzzled amateur naturalists. And well they may, on\r\nseeing in some works on ophiology a list of synonyms sometimes filling\r\nseveral pages.\r\n\r\nBy way of illustration let us take the little spine-toothed snake\r\ndescribed among the egg-eaters in chap. iii. This snake was known\r\nto be _edentulus_ by Linnæus, who nevertheless gave it the generic\r\nname of _Coluber_, because it has two rows of sub-caudal plates; and\r\nthe specific _scaber_, because it has roughly-carinated scales—both\r\nnames equally applicable to a score of other snakes, and not at\r\nall describing its unique dentition. This latter was first made a\r\ndistinguishing feature by Jourdan, 1833, who assigned it the generic\r\nname of _Rachiodon_, spine-toothed. Lacepède called it simply _La\r\nrude_; Wagler, _Dasypeltis_, thick or rough-scaled, the integument\r\nrather than the dentition still receiving prior attention by the\r\nmajority of observers.\r\n\r\nDr. Andrew Smith in 1829 more closely watched its habits, and\r\nconsidered that its peculiar dentition was sufficient to separate it\r\nfrom the _Oligodon_ (few-toothed) family, under the new generic name\r\nof _Anodon_, with the specific _typus_ to mark it as a distinct type.\r\nAfterwards he found that the word _Anodon_ had been already adopted\r\nby naturalists for a shell-fish, and he contented himself therefore\r\nwith Wagler’s name _Dasypeltis_, adding _inornatus_ for its specific,\r\notherwise _D. scaber_. It is a small, slender snake, rarely exceeding\r\n2-1/2 feet in length, and of an inconspicuous brownish colour. That it\r\nis an extremely slender little snake is evident from the portion of\r\nspine copied from the skeleton in the museum of R. C. S., and given in\r\nthe chapter on egg-eating snakes. Jourdan’s name _Rachiodon_, though\r\nthe best that had hitherto been assigned to the spine-toothed tree\r\nsnake, was yet rather vague, as the teeth might be anywhere along the\r\nspinal column; and Professor Owen still further improved upon this\r\nname by calling it _Deirodon_, neck-toothed; for though, as already\r\nstated, a snake has no true ‘neck,’ the word _Deirodon_ designates the\r\nposition of those gular teeth; and for convenience, everybody speaks\r\nof a snake’s ‘neck’ in allusion to the part immediately behind the\r\nhead. So the little egg-eating tree snake is equally well entitled\r\nto the generic names of _Oligodon_, few teeth; _Rachiodon_, spine\r\nteeth; _Anodon_, toothless (as far as true teeth are concerned); and\r\n_Deirodon_, neck-toothed. In habits it differs entirely from the\r\n_Oligodontidæ_ family, which are ground snakes. The Deirodons are\r\nfrequently found concealed under the loose bark of dead trees; and Dr.\r\nA. Smith observed three species all having a like organization, which\r\ninduced him to conclude that all feed alike on birds’ eggs.\r\n\r\nAs very few snakes have such an exceptionally distinguishing\r\norganization as the _Deirodon_, few are so happy as to escape with\r\nonly half a score of titles. Many species that have been longer known\r\nhave had their names similarly improved upon by fifty naturalists,\r\nand are still undergoing renomination as new observers discover closer\r\nalliances with one or another family. This is particularly the case in\r\nAmerica, where a nomenclature entirely differing from our own is often\r\nadopted. It will probably be the same in Australia as the science of\r\nophiology advances and as native naturalists increase. Says Krefft,\r\nin allusion to these commingling features and many synonyms: ‘It is\r\ndifficult for even the scholar to master the vexatious question of\r\nsnake classification.’ Add to the scientific names an equal number\r\nof vernacular ones, and we encounter a list sufficient to dismay the\r\nmerely lukewarm student at the very outset.\r\n\r\nLet me here suggest the utility of first getting at the _meaning_\r\nof scientific terms as an immense assistance towards fixing them in\r\nthe memory. In the construction of generic and specific names some\r\npeculiarity is, or should be, described. This I have endeavoured to\r\nkeep before the reader throughout this volume; and by first looking\r\nat the _meaning_ of the word, it is at once simplified, while that\r\npeculiar feature for which it is named is also grasped. Occasionally a\r\nname baffles us, it is true, and one fails to see cause or reason in\r\nit; but this is an exception. Other names without apparent reason are\r\nfrom persons, as, for instance, when a Mr. Smith thinks to immortalize\r\nhimself by calling a snake _Coluber smithii_. Probably the next\r\nobserver would find this too general to be of much use, and discover\r\nsome peculiarity more worthy of a specific.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, when Lacerda was experimenting with our distinguished\r\nophidian, the ‘Curucucu’ (_Bothrops_ or _Lachesis rhombeata_), it\r\nwas variously introduced to the public through the daily press,\r\nas the _Bothraps rhambeata_, the _Hachesis rhambeata_, and the\r\n_Lachesis rhambeata_. It is doubtful whether many of the ‘general\r\npublic’ imagined these three names to represent the same snake, or\r\nwhether—except possibly from the last generic one—they could form\r\nany idea of the reptile therefrom. Of the many papers that fell under\r\none’s notice, _Land and Water_ alone on this occasion spelt the words\r\ncorrectly. As yet there is no journal devoted to the Reptilia, and the\r\nstudy is evidently not attractive. Nor do we expect all naturalists to\r\nbe ophiologists; but those of the editors who were zoologists might\r\nhave hazarded a guess and made sense of the generic _Lachesis_, seeing\r\nthat a deadly, fateful serpent was intended. Some of the scientific\r\n‘weeklies’ having started the wrong names, unscientific ‘dailies’\r\ndeferentially transcribed them. The errors were chiefly traceable\r\nto caligraphy, and are mentioned here to exemplify the advantage\r\nof seeking a meaning in scientific appellations, the meanings of\r\nsome names being so obvious that in spite of a wrong letter you may\r\nfrequently decide upon them.\r\n\r\nThis fateful _Lachesis_ of South America has been as perplexingly\r\ndescribed by unscientific travellers as the _Jararaca_, and as hard to\r\nidentify. It has been a stumbling-block and a snare ever since the time\r\nof Waterton, who thus wrote of it:[117]—‘Unrivalled in the display of\r\nevery lovely colour of the rainbow, and unmatched in the effects of his\r\ndeadly poison, the _counacouchi_ glides undaunted on, sole monarch of\r\nthese forests. He sometimes grows to the length of fourteen feet. He is\r\ncommonly known by the name of _Bushmaster_. Man and beast fly before\r\nhim,’ etc. Waterton ‘wandered’ between the years 1812-1824, making\r\nseveral journeys to South America, primarily with the view to ascertain\r\nthe composition and effects of the Wourali poison, and on this subject\r\nhis information was of value. But his descriptions of serpents partook\r\nof the prejudices of that date, and were more picturesque than\r\nzoological. What he saw and wrote of possessed the charm of novelty in\r\nthose days, and Sir Joseph Banks addressed a letter to him expressing\r\n‘abundant thanks for the very instructive lesson you have favoured us\r\nwith, which far excels in real utility anything I have yet seen.’\r\n\r\nEndorsed by such an authority, what wonder that fourteen feet of\r\nradiantly splendid ‘Bushmaster’ should figure in the encyclopedias\r\nof the day, and be copied by book-makers and magazine contributors\r\nfor years and years—even to the recent date of 1874! Hartwig,\r\n1873,[118] gives Waterton’s ‘rainbow hues’ nearly word for word, with\r\nthe addition of one of the scientific names, _Lachesis rhombeata_.\r\nKingston, 1874,[119] aided by his imagination, improves on Waterton.\r\nThe _Curucucu_, or _Couanacouchi_, ‘sometimes fourteen feet, is the\r\nlargest known poisonous snake. It is remarkable for the glowing\r\nradiance of its fearful beauty, displaying all the prismatic colours.\r\nIt mounts trees with the greatest ease,’ etc. (It lies half concealed\r\n_under_ the trees among dead leaves.) Another writer of _Travels round\r\nthe World_ (meaning the British Museum Reading-room) contents himself\r\nwith simply a ‘rainbow-coloured’ Bushmaster; so now in imagination\r\nwe add indigo, blue, green, etc., to the ‘fearful beauty.’ Meanwhile\r\nother writers on Brazil introduce it as the Surucuru, Sorococo,\r\nCouroucoucou, Souroucoucou, Surukuku, and similar names, varied only\r\nby a transposition of letters and the addition of accents. Tschudi\r\nmentions it under its scientific name, _Lachesis rhombeata_, the\r\n‘Flammon’ in Peru.[120] Sulivan,[121] who, like Waterton, rambled in\r\nSouth America, tells us ‘the Couni Couchi or Bushmaster is the most\r\ndreaded of all the South America serpents; and, as his name implies, he\r\nroams absolute master of the forest. They do not fly from man, but will\r\neven pursue and attack him. They are fat, clumsy-looking animals, about\r\nfour’ (not fourteen) ‘feet long, and nearly as thick as a man’s arm.\r\nThey strike with immense force.’ A man had been bitten in the thigh and\r\ndied, and ‘the wound was as if two four-inch nails had been driven into\r\nthe flesh. So long are the fangs, and so deep the wounds, that there\r\nis no hope of being cured.’ P. H. Gosse quotes Sulivan regarding the\r\nenormous fangs, both of these latter writers judiciously omitting the\r\n‘rainbow’ colouring.\r\n\r\nMost snakes, even the dingiest, occasionally display an iridescence\r\nwhich is certainly beautiful; and Waterton may have seen his\r\nCounicouchi when the sun lighted up the recently-renewed epidermis and\r\nshowed him off in unusual brilliance; only, unfortunately, the copyists\r\nhave imagined the greens and crimsons and blues of the rainbow, and\r\nrendered it a tedious business to poor patient plodders to arrive at\r\nthe truth. In the _Encyclopædia Metropolitana_, 1845, we find another\r\nclue to identification. ‘_Trigonocephalus mutus_, a native of the\r\nBrazils and Guiana, and from six to seven feet long, is known to the\r\nBrazilians as _Surukuku_, and is probably the _Boschmeester_ of the\r\nDutch and the _Cœnicoussi_ of the native inhabitants.’\r\n\r\nMany writers of travels give the vernacular names only, while the\r\nmore scientific who do give generic and specific names, may each give\r\na different one and perhaps omit the vernaculars; and in none of the\r\nauthorities does one discover the name ‘Bushmaster’ at all; while as to\r\ncolour and the true size we can be sure of nothing.\r\n\r\nPresenting these complications to Dr. Stradling, whose kindly proffered\r\nco-operation I had gladly accepted, he wrote: ‘The vulgar names are\r\noften _local_ in a limited area, so that the same snake may be known\r\nby half-a-dozen different synonyms in as many different provinces—not\r\nonly that, but these names are often applied to other snakes; and\r\nthus, while some species are blended together, many imaginary ones are\r\ncreated.’\r\n\r\nThis in part explains the varieties of spelling seen above; the two\r\nnames _couanacouchi_ and _curucoocu_ being applied to one snake by\r\ndifferent tribes of the native races extending over a rather wide area.\r\n\r\nFurther confirmation of these indiscriminate terms we find in three\r\nother writers, viz.:—First, Dr. Dalton:[122] ‘The boa constrictor\r\nis known as “Bushmaster” by the colonists. “Camoudi” is a name\r\nindiscriminately applied to all large snakes. There is the land\r\nCamoudi, and the water Camoudi, while the Kunikusi or Courracouchi\r\nof the Indians is _Crotalus mutus_, which is termed “Bushmaster” in\r\nthe forests.’ Secondly, H. W. Bates[123] says: ‘The natives called\r\n_Trigonocephalus atrox_ the Jararaca.’ Thirdly, Dr. Otho Wucherer[124]\r\naffirms that a ‘venomous tree snake (_Craspedocephalus bilineatus_)\r\nis called _Surucucu patyoba_, from the palm on which it is found, and\r\nanother tree snake is _Suru. Uricana_, from another palm in which it\r\nresides; while _the_ Surucucu (_Lachesis mutus_) lives in holes in\r\nthe ground. It is about ten feet long.’ This latter is called _Suru.\r\nbico di jacca_, from the resemblance of its strongly-keeled scales to\r\nthe prominences on the ‘jack fruit;’ _Xenodon rhabdocephalus_ is also\r\n_surucucu_, while the true ‘Jararaca’ is _Craspedocephalus atrox_.\r\n\r\nHere are contradictory _Curucucus_ and _Jararacas_ in plenty, all\r\nimpressing upon us the importance of comparing evidence if we wish to\r\narrive at a truth.\r\n\r\n‘Why spend so much time about a mere name?’ Well, as in the solution\r\nof a problem, you desire to ‘get it right.’ Besides, you ask, ‘Why so\r\nmany names to one snake?’ and in sifting out this _Curucucu_ and the\r\n_Jararaca_, we discover reasons for the many synonyms.\r\n\r\nA. R. Wallace once more presents a clue:[125] ‘At Säo Gabriel I saw\r\non the rocks asleep one of the most deadly serpents in South America,\r\nthe “Surucurú” (_Lachesis mutus_). It is very handsomely marked with\r\nrich amber brown, and armed with terrific poison fangs, two on each\r\nside.’ Here we are enabled to associate a scientific and a vernacular\r\nname with a ‘handsome,’ though not a ‘rainbow-coloured’ serpent. Sir\r\nJ. Fayrer describes the _Ophiophagus_ as the largest known venomous\r\nserpent ‘_except_ the Bushmaster, which is said to attain fourteen\r\nfeet.’\r\n\r\nBy this time, in addition to the ever-varying vernaculars, we learn of\r\nWaterton’s ‘Bushmaster’ as _Lachesis mutus_; _L. rhombeatus_; _Crotalus\r\nmutus_; _Trigonocephalus mutus_.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the word _Trigonocephalus_ is used as a\r\ngeneric name by some naturalists, and as a specific by others; and it\r\nmay with reason be applied to most of the American thanatophidia which\r\nare not _elapidæ_. It therefore, at least, enables us to ascertain\r\nthat the snake of doubtful identity has this viperine characteristic\r\nof the angular head; and as there is only one very small true viper at\r\npresent known in the New World, we may further decide that not being\r\nan _Elaps_, our puzzler is a _Bothrops_ with the _doubles narines_,\r\nand therefore equally meriting either of the descriptives _atropos_,\r\n_atrox_, _furia_, _megæra_, _clotho_, _cophias_, and other such fearful\r\nappellatives freely used to designate the deadly qualities of the worst\r\nclass of serpents. In reply to a communication of mine to _Land and\r\nWater_, of 2d October 1880, Dr. Stradling[126] entered more fully into\r\nthis question of vernaculars, and what he says of Brazil we find to be\r\nthe case everywhere:—\r\n\r\n ‘Whatever meaning the colloquial titles have is generally grounded on\r\n some popular error.’\r\n\r\nThis we saw in the case of _Xenodon_ and _Heterodon_, both called all\r\nsorts of bad names on account of their supposed fangs.\r\n\r\n ‘In Brazil, _Jeboia_ and _Cascavel_ are the universal names for the\r\n boa and rattlesnake; every snake with red in its markings is a coral\r\n snake (“corral,” from the Spanish word for a ring), every one found\r\n in or near the water would be a _Cobra de agua_, and every other is a\r\n Jarraracca or a Curucucu.\r\n\r\n ‘I believe every country has a pet bugbear among serpents.\r\n “Fer-de-lance” is the cry in St. Lucia when a snake rustles away in\r\n the bush or inflicts a bite unseen, “Bushmaster” in Demerara, “Toboba”\r\n in Nicaragua, “Vaia” in Mexico, “Vivera de la cruz” in the River\r\n Plate. Over and over again have I had snakes of widely different\r\n species sent to me, each guaranteed to be a genuine Jarraracca, until\r\n I began to doubt whether the Jarraracca had any existence at all. I\r\n believe that the one I sent to the Zoological Gardens the other day\r\n is the real thing—_Craspedocephalus Brasiliensis_—at last’ (the\r\n _Xenodon_ after all!) ‘and I think I have sifted the Curucucu down by\r\n elimination till I can fix the term on _Trigonocephalus atrox_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n ‘I fear we shall never get a decent classification till some competent\r\n observer studies them on their native soil; the excellence of the\r\n books on Indian reptiles is doubtless due to this. We want a man in\r\n authority to settle the very vernacular for us—one who can say, “This\r\n and no other shall be the Jarraracca, this the Bushmaster,” etc., for\r\n it is undoubtedly a great advantage to have a well-defined native or\r\n local synonym. The marvel is that the present classification should be\r\n so good as it is. Look at the difficulties. When people see a snake\r\n they rush at it, smash it with sticks or stones, pick up what is left\r\n of it and put it in a bottle of cauha, cachasse, rum, or other coarse\r\n spirit, label it with a wrong name, and send it home. And these are\r\n the materials an ophiologist has to build on.’[127]\r\n\r\nKrefft, speaking of the confusion of vernaculars in Australia, also\r\nsays: ‘To make a work on ophiology useful to all, _co-operation is\r\nnecessary_; and as a good, sound English name is prefixed to every\r\nspecies, it is to be hoped that such name will, if possible, be\r\nretained.’ He is referring more particularly to the ‘Diamond snake,’\r\nwhich on the mainland is the harmless _Python molurus_, and in Tasmania\r\nthe venomous _Hoplocephalus superbus_, with very broad scales.\r\nTherefore he ‘hopes that Tasmanian friends will accept the designation\r\n“Broad-scaled snake” in lieu of “Diamond” for their poisonous species.’\r\nIn the accounts sent to England, the indiscriminate use of such\r\nprefixes as the _black_ snake, the _brown_ snake, causes infinite\r\nperplexity, and not unfrequently furnishes argumentative articles\r\nto the journals. ‘Carpet’ snake is another vernacular applied to a\r\nharmless species in Australia, and to the extremely venomous little\r\n_Echis_ of India. Then every country has its ‘Deaf adder’ which is\r\nneither an ‘adder’ nor ‘deaf.’ And the ‘moccasin’ of the United States\r\nis a still existing stumbling-block.\r\n\r\nAnother great confusion in classification has been in consequence of\r\nsome of the earlier naturalists representing young snakes, or those of\r\nvarying colours, as distinct species. It is very common for a young\r\nsnake to differ in colour from the parent, and also common for those\r\nof the same brood to differ from each other. Of _Coluber canis_ Dr. A.\r\nSmith says scarcely any two are marked and coloured alike. In a brood\r\nof the broad-scaled Tasmanian snake, _H. superbus_, there were upwards\r\nof thirty young ones, some of which Krefft describes as banded, and of\r\na light colour, the rest being black. Our English slow-worm varies from\r\ndead black to nearly white, or flesh colour, one of the latter being an\r\ninmate of the Gardens at the time of writing, March 1882. The English\r\nviper also varies in colour, and we have heard of a perfectly yellow\r\nring snake.\r\n\r\nIn England we have so few snakes, viz. the ring snake, the coronella,\r\nand one viper, and these three so distinct, that we are not likely to\r\nbe perplexed with many varieties; but in tropical or semi-tropical\r\nregions, where closely-allied species abound, it may be suspected that\r\n_hybrids_ not unfrequently create confusion as well as a multiplication\r\nof supposed ‘species’ not likely to cease. In our small London\r\ncollection, hybrids have been produced at least twice within a few\r\nyears; and we fear that the habit of hibernating in mixed multitudes\r\nleads to some immorality among the Ophidia. It is like the overcrowded\r\ndwellings of the poor, and the ‘free-lovers’ of America; and perhaps to\r\nophidian unions between congeners occasionally may be traced not a few\r\nof the varieties which so curiously and closely blend different species\r\nand are a plague to classifiers. This is mere speculation.\r\n\r\nThe Indian vernaculars are as abundant and perplexing as those of\r\nBrazil. Of the cobras, Sir J. Fayrer says there are many varieties\r\nwhich the natives consider different species. ‘The snake charmers\r\nare poor naturalists, and disseminate many false notions as well\r\nas dangerous ones about the cobras.’ In the _Thanatophidia_ nine\r\nor ten varieties are figured, all of the one single species (_Naja\r\ntripudians_), though all bear different vernaculars. The two chief\r\ndistinctions in the markings are the spots on the back of the ‘neck,’\r\nwhich, when the hood is distended, are easily distinguished. One with\r\na single ocellus is the _Keautiah_, known as ‘Kala samp,’ ‘Nag samp,’\r\netc., being chiefly of the field or jungle. The other with the double\r\nocellus is the ‘spectacled cobra,’ and essentially of the town. This is\r\nthe ‘Gokurrah’ of the natives, and the favourite of the snake charmers.\r\nBeing common all over a country which boasts of thirty-six written\r\nlanguages, the reader can imagine the number of vernaculars bestowed\r\nupon the _Cobra capella_.\r\n\r\nThe _ophiophagus_ is almost equally favoured, as this snake also varies\r\nin colour, particularly in the young ones, which Fayrer affirms might\r\neasily be mistaken for a different species. Probably wherever snakes\r\nabound, the vernaculars are correspondingly numerous.\r\n\r\n‘And after all which _is_ the Curucucu, and which _is_ the Jararaca?’\r\nBeing the proud possessor of both, I may describe them from nature;\r\nbut conflicting opinions as to their identity still exist, because\r\nthere are features in common among congeneric species, and what one\r\nauthor may decide is the _Curucucu_ another will call the _Jararaca_.\r\nDumeril, Gray, Günther, and other modern ophiologists have, however, so\r\nfar simplified difficulties, as to recognise only one of each in our\r\nzoological collections, notwithstanding the liberal use of both terms\r\nin Brazil.\r\n\r\n_Our_ _Curucucu_, then, _Lachesis_ or _Crotalus mutus_, has the flat,\r\nviperine head, covered with fine scales. The only plates are the\r\nupper and lower labials, one over the eye, and a pair of rather large\r\nones under the chin. The ‘pit’ is very distinct, showing it to be a\r\n_Bothrops_ and one of the _Crotalidæ_. The body colour is of a pale\r\nmaize, approaching umber towards the back, and lighter on the belly,\r\nwith a chain of rich chocolate-brown, jagged, rhomboid spots, edged\r\nwith darker tints, along the back. It is undeniably handsome, and in\r\nlife no doubt was iridescent, but alas for the ‘rainbow splendours,’\r\nthey have vanished! In length it is about nine feet, and in girth as\r\nbig as one’s arm in the largest part. Its tail tapers suddenly. One\r\nsees in the strongly-keeled scales the ‘prominences’ alluded to by\r\nDr. Wucherer; and as the fangs are represented life-size on p. 360,\r\nthe reader can judge for himself about the ‘four-inch nails.’ Mine\r\nis probably a nearly full-grown serpent, therefore an average-size\r\nspecimen, and much the same as the one brought to the Gardens in the\r\nsummer of 1881, which lingered a pitiable object for six or eight\r\nmonths, eating nothing, and gradually wasting.\r\n\r\nThe _Jararaca_ is a slighter snake, and in colour of an olive tint with\r\ndarker markings, not unlike Xenodon’s jagged leaf pattern along the\r\nback. Its right to the name of _Craspedocephalus_ (_craspedo_, derived\r\nfrom a Greek word signifying an edge or border) is recognised by a\r\npeculiar ridge round its flat, angular, and almost lance-shaped head.\r\nIt is also a _Trigonocephalus_ and a _Bothrops_. My specimen being only\r\nhalf-grown is about three feet long, and the thickness of your little\r\nfinger. ‘Is there not great confusion in the application of the terms\r\n_craspedoceph._ and _trigonoceph._?’ wrote Dr. Stradling, on sending me\r\nthese much-prized specimens. Yes, there certainly is; but by this time\r\nthe reader sees the reason for this, and also for the many appellatives\r\nwhich they derive from the Fates and the Furies. Not to weary the\r\nreader with further lists of names, I will refer him to Gray’s\r\n_Catalogue of the British Museum Snakes_, p. 5, for _the_ accepted\r\n_Jararaca_ of the authorities, and to Dumeril, tome vii. pt. ii. p.\r\n1509, for the same; both authors giving the numerous synonyms, and the\r\nlatter the reasons for many of them. The student will there see how\r\nWagler is supposed to have described young snakes as different species;\r\nand if further investigation be invited, a good deal of entertainment\r\nmay be had from Wagler himself and his folio volume,[128] _Serpentum\r\nBraziliensis_, with its wonderful coloured illustrations. Then for\r\nthe _Curucucu_, the _Lachesis mutus_ of modern ophiologists, see p.\r\n13 of Gray, and p. 1486, tome vii. pt. ii. of Dumeril et Bibron. From\r\nthese authors we may go back to Marcgrave, 1648, for the ‘_Cvrvcvcv\r\nBraziliensibus_, fifteen palms long, truculent and much to be feared.’\r\nMarcgrave’s book is embellished with marvellous pictures which are not\r\nlikely to enlighten us much; but through him we are enabled to identify\r\nsome of his serpents with the vernaculars, for, like the Pilgrim\r\nPurchas, the vernaculars were all he had to guide him.\r\n\r\nAuthorities recognise six or seven species of _Craspedocephalus_,\r\npresumably all having the easily distinguishable edge like a thin cord\r\nround their heads, and which doubtless were the ‘prominent Veines’\r\ndescribed by Purchas in the Brazilian species, now generally recognised\r\nas ‘_the_ Jararaca.’ I will invite my readers to ‘co-operate’ and\r\ncall no harmless little snakes by this name, which originally implied\r\nsomething terrible.\r\n\r\n‘And what is the outcome of all this etymological jumble?’\r\n\r\n‘Well, we at least learn that as in English the words snake, adder,\r\nserpent, have a somewhat general signification, so have some of the\r\nBrazilian vernaculars. But I cannot help thinking that many of these\r\nnames had more of natural history in them than we are apt to suspect,\r\nthough no doubt the original meaning has become much corrupted during\r\nthree hundred years’ colonization. The native races knew quite well\r\nthat some snakes were dangerous and some harmless, which is more than\r\ncan be said for the present occupiers of South America, who think all\r\nvenomous as a matter of a course.\r\n\r\nThe differences in spelling the same word may guide us in the\r\npronunciation of it; as, for example, the _c_ sometimes as _k_, in\r\nCamoudi, or Kamoodi, and as _s_ in Curucoocu or Sooroocoocoo. In these\r\nlatter words we also find the _u_ identical with _oo_, as in the Hindû\r\nor Hindoo words. Again, the _j_ is as _i_ in _Jararaca_ or _Iararacca_,\r\nor more probably a sound with which we are unfamiliar, as the word is\r\nsometimes _Shiraraca_. The frequent transposition of syllables hints\r\nat a meaning which may be worth seeking by a philologist, should he be\r\nalso an ophiophilist. Some local information on these points I much\r\nhoped to obtain; but alas! (_for this chapter_) the trips to Brazil of\r\nmy excellent ally came to an end! Independently of which, the native\r\ndialects could only be studied in the far interior, where, here and\r\nthere, some tribes may still be found in their pristine simplicity,\r\nthough it is very doubtful whether their dialects to-day are those\r\nfrom which the first European settlers obtained their _Curucucus_ and\r\n_Jararacas_.\r\n\r\nThe repetition of syllables in these strange dialects seems to point\r\nat some intention. Can those frequently occurring _raras_ and _cucus_\r\nrepresent degrees? For instance, we are told that the Jarrara_cucu_\r\nis ‘the largest of the Jarraracas.’ And we are quite sure that the\r\n_Cucu_rijuba, ‘which killeth by winding certain turnes of his tayle,’\r\nis the boa constrictor; and that the _Cururiubù_, ‘which keepeth\r\nalwaies in the water,’ is the anaconda, these syllables evidently\r\nrepresenting bulk or something formidable: as we have them abounding\r\nin _curucucu_, the most formidable of all serpents. Then _Ibibo_ might\r\nimply beauty or gay colouring. A snake, _Ibiboco_, with red and black\r\nrings, ‘the fairest but of foulest venom,’ is undoubtedly _Elaps\r\nlemniscatus_; while Ibiboboca, ‘_ainsi nommé par sa grande beauté_,’ is\r\n‘_harmlesse_.’ _Peba_ as a termination may imply danger; as there is\r\nthe Jararac_peba_, ‘most venomous,’ and a ‘very venomous’ rattlesnake,\r\nBoicininin_peba_. The curious repetition of _in_ in _Boycininga_,\r\nrattlesnake (p. 272), seems to hint at the length of its rattle and\r\nthe degree of crepitation it produces, especially as we find the\r\nsubstitution of _g_ for _c_ in some of these words, and the soft _gi_\r\nrapidly repeated is not unlike the true sound.\r\n\r\nThere is a long and slender tree snake ‘that eateth eggs, and goeth\r\nfaster on the trees than any man can runne on the ground, with\r\na motion not unlike swimming.’ Its correspondingly long name is\r\n_Guiaranpiaquana_! Vain indeed would be any speculation as to what that\r\nmay mean. Vain also, and I fear tedious, may all this guess-work be to\r\ndiscover meaning and poetry in what may probably be dead languages.\r\nWho shall say how many thousand years ago these singular repetitions\r\nconveyed to the savage mind (but _was_ it savage?) an idea of the\r\ncreatures around them?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n_DO SNAKES INCUBATE THEIR EGGS?_\r\n\r\n\r\nWE come now to treat of facts no less interesting than surprising in\r\nophidian biographies. Already we have recounted almost marvellous\r\npowers possessed by this class of animals—functions which are\r\nvolitionary, such as the management of their trachea, the voluntary\r\nfolding back or unfolding of certain teeth, the practical adaptation of\r\ntheir ribs and coils to what we may almost call manual work, and now,\r\nmost astonishing of all, the voluntary deposition or retention of ova,\r\neven of young.\r\n\r\n‘Snakes are either oviparous or viviparous,’ is what we are accustomed\r\nto read, followed by the explanation that the former are those which\r\nlay eggs, and the latter those which produce their young alive. To\r\nthese two chief distinctions, the more recent one of ovoviviparous\r\nhas been added, to describe some intermediate cases where the egg is\r\nruptured in parturition, so that again a fully-formed young one is\r\nborn. For broad distinctions the three terms do well enough, though\r\nmany exceptions exist. The grand distinction of ‘_viper_’ as applied\r\nto those snakes which produce live young, was adopted when snakes were\r\nfirst observed and described by classic writers.\r\n\r\n‘Vipers alone are viviparous,’ wrote Aristotle. ‘Sometimes the little\r\nvipers eat through their mother and come forth. The viper brings forth\r\none at a time in one day, but she brings forth more than twenty little\r\nvipers. Other serpents produce their eggs externally, and these eggs\r\nare connected with each other like the necklaces of women. But when\r\nthey bring forth, they deposit their eggs in the earth, _and there\r\nincubate them_. These eggs they disclose the following year.’ We do not\r\nquote the above as all fact, but rather to show how very much there has\r\nbeen to _unlearn_ since Aristotle was accepted as an authority. The\r\nshadow of truth and the mention of a possible fact as an invariable\r\nrule are dangerous mistakes, for, as we have already shown, where a\r\nsnake is concerned, one can rarely feel safe in asserting anything as\r\npositive. It is not impossible that, owing to disease or accident,\r\nsome gravid viper may have been so wounded as to enable her young to\r\nmake their début through her ruptured side. Such an occurrence has\r\nbeen seen in our own time. Aristotle or his authority may even have\r\nwitnessed such an accident, and recorded it under the supposition that\r\nit was normal. In whatever way the error may have originated, it is\r\nonly one out of many that are propagated even to the present day by the\r\nuninformed.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of writing, we read in one of our first-class ‘dailies,’\r\nalluding to a brood of young vipers lately born at the Zoological\r\nGardens: ‘The young viper comes into the world in the shape of an\r\negg, and its first business is to push through the filmy membrane\r\nwhich envelops it in its imprisoned form.’ This is contrary to our\r\naccepted ideas, though partially true in this instance. The word\r\nviper is generally supposed to be derived from the Latin _vipera_, a\r\ncontraction of _vivipara_, to produce alive. The above words therefore\r\nare inapplicable as a rule.\r\n\r\nSo far as was known in Aristotle’s time, only certain venomous species\r\ncommon in the countries with which classic writers were best acquainted\r\ndid produce live young, and they were mostly what are still known as\r\n‘vipers,’ a term restricted to these and explained as being derived\r\nfrom such signification.\r\n\r\nOpportunities of study and of observation afforded in menageries and\r\nzoological gardens at the present day have caused the term _viper_ as\r\nrelating to gestation to be discarded, or many non-venomous snakes must\r\nbe included, thus overthrowing all our notions of vipers. As was shown\r\nin the preceding chapters, the name is now associated with dentition.\r\n\r\nGerman and French ophiologists affirm that the three distinctions of\r\n_oviparous_, _viviparous_, and _ovoviviparous_ are founded on no other\r\nground than the greater or less development of the fœtus at the time of\r\ndeposition.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the egg-covering or ‘shell’ has also to do with this. In\r\neggs which take a longer time to mature or to ‘hatch,’ the external\r\ncovering is thicker and more leathery; in those which are hatched\r\neither before or on deposition, the shell is thinner, more membranous.\r\nAlways, however, there is a calcareous element in the shell, and the\r\neggs are generally, _but not invariably_, linked together.\r\n\r\nHeat and moisture are essential to the hatching of eggs. When at\r\nliberty the snake selects some spot among decaying leaves, or in a\r\nmanure heap where decomposition produces sufficient warmth. In the\r\ntropics, where the sun’s rays alone suffice, a soft moist bed is more\r\neasily found, and here it is that immense broods are produced.\r\n\r\nThe period of gestation can scarcely be pronounced upon with certainty.\r\nIt depends not only on the size of the snake, but on the degree of\r\nwarmth that can be enjoyed as an assistant to mature the eggs. Schlegel\r\nmentions three or four months from copulation to the laying of eggs in\r\nthe species indigenous to France. But as other circumstances combine to\r\ncause variations in these periods, it is very unsafe to fix upon the\r\nprecise time of gestation.\r\n\r\nSays Rymer Jones, ‘Reptiles do not sit (_sic_) upon their eggs, hence\r\nthe latter have only a membranous envelope. In many of the reptiles\r\nwhich lay eggs, especially the _Colubri_ (colubrine snakes), the\r\nyoung one is already formed and considerably advanced in the egg at\r\nthe moment when the mother lays it; and it is the same with those\r\nspecies which may at pleasure be rendered viviparous by retarding their\r\nlaying.’[129] The latter words are traced to Cuvier, and prove that\r\nthis most remarkable power has long been recognised.\r\n\r\nIn the first few words of the above, Jones spoke of reptiles generally\r\nfrom toads to turtles; with the latter, soft eggs would certainly fare\r\nbadly did they attempt to incubate them. Still the term ‘reptiles’ is\r\nmisleading, because, as is now well known, some snakes do incubate,\r\nand some lizards are suspected of doing the same. Even our common ring\r\nsnake has been found coiled upon her eggs.\r\n\r\nSerpents are allied to birds in producing young from eggs, but in\r\nreptiles the eggs differ from those of birds in undergoing a sort of\r\nincubation from the very first; so that at whatever period a snake’s\r\negg is examined, whether it has been laid or not, the embryo will\r\nbe found more or less advanced. Sometimes in an egg just deposited,\r\na perfectly formed fœtus will be found. ‘Serpents are _always_\r\noviparous,’ says Schlegel; ‘and it is a mistake to suppose that all\r\nvenomous snakes produce live young, and all non-venomous kinds lay\r\neggs. Neither has the diversity of generation any relation to the\r\norganization of the animal itself. _Coronella lævis_ produces living\r\nyoung, but other _coronellas_ lay eggs. In 1862, when very little was\r\nknown of the _Coronella lævis_, Mr. Frank Buckland had one in a cage in\r\nLondon, which to the surprise of most persons produced live young ones.\r\nThis may have been solely owing to her captivity and her retention\r\nof eggs till hatched. Some boas lay eggs, others are viviparous. In\r\nthe latter case the young are enclosed in a thin membrane, which they\r\ntear or break at the moment of birth. In those that are a long while\r\nhatching, the tunic is of a thick, coriaceous texture, not easily\r\nruptured. Thus, to sum up with one other authority, Der Hœven: ‘In many\r\nserpents and lizards the development begins in the body of the parent\r\nbefore the egg is laid, and in some the membrane of the egg is broken\r\nby the young one before birth.’\r\n\r\nThis latter condition has been considered viperine, but even in a\r\nviper the young have been produced in a membrane. This was the case\r\nwith _Vipera nasicornis_ at the London Zoological Gardens, on Sunday,\r\nNovember 6th, 1881, that gave birth to forty-six viperlings. Some of\r\nthem had no vestige of membrane clinging about them; others had, but\r\nburst it immediately and began to crawl; while yet others did not burst\r\ntheir ‘shell’ at all,—if indeed so filmy and thin a membrane could\r\nbe called a shell,—but died within it. When the membrane burst, it\r\nwas seen to collapse and shrivel up into nothing, as children’s air\r\nballs do when they are torn; but the texture of these balls is strong\r\nin comparison with the extreme tenuity of the viperine egg tunic. Yet\r\nit was strong enough to contain a young one, as in the case of those\r\nunbroken. There is no means of ascertaining the precise length of time\r\nthis viper had been in captivity; but as her young ones had all such\r\nfully-developed fangs, and the precocity to strike and kill a mouse as\r\nsoon as born, this was probably another case of postponed deposition.\r\nOn a previous occasion, September 1875, a family of young vipers born\r\nat the Ophidarium were ‘_some quite clean and others with the remains\r\nof the egg covering about them_.’ The quotation from my notebook refers\r\nto the Daboia of India, ‘Russell’s viper’ (_Vipera elegans_). Still\r\nthese may be exceptional and possibly abnormal cases, but are examples\r\nworth noting, and another proof of the many exceptions to what we are\r\naccustomed to believe invariable rules.\r\n\r\nWhite, in his _History of Selborne_, mentions the capture of a viper\r\nin which he found fifteen young, the shortest being seven inches. They\r\nwere active, spiteful, and menacing, and yet ‘had no manner of fangs\r\nthat we could find, even with the help of our glasses.’\r\n\r\nMr. Frank Buckland tells of a man who cut open a string of snake’s\r\neggs, and the young, thus prematurely introduced into the world,\r\n‘showed fight.’\r\n\r\nOf historical ophidians which have figured in many pages, first comes\r\nchronologically the Paris python, that in 1841 laid fifteen eggs and\r\nincubated them. She has already been alluded to in chap. iv., but\r\nclaims further mention presently.\r\n\r\nA python in the Amsterdam collection next hatched twenty-two eggs.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 a python at the London Gardens laid above a hundred\r\neggs,—‘more than a bushel,’ according to the keeper,—and settled\r\nherself to hatch them. Much interest attaches itself to this lady’s\r\nhistory; but first to complete our list chronologically, the following\r\nharmless species in the London collection have within the last ten\r\nyears produced live young, being examples of that ‘diversity of\r\ngeneration’ of which Schlegel speaks.\r\n\r\nAugust 1872, the ‘seven-banded snake’ (_Trop. leberis_) had five young\r\nand some eggs at the same time.\r\n\r\nJune 1873, a _Coluber natrix_ had seven young ones. (I cannot affirm\r\npositively that these were born alive; I think not, from an especial\r\nentry in my notebook concerning them; but the records of the Zoological\r\nSociety in which I have sought for confirmation do not announce them as\r\n‘hatched.’)\r\n\r\nAugust 1873, a yellow Jamaica boa (_Chilobothrus inornatus_) gave birth\r\nto fourteen young ones, ten of which survived. They crawled up to the\r\ntop of their cage as soon as they saw daylight, and showed signs of\r\nfight. One little aggressor struck at me when I held it, and tried\r\nto bite me through my glove,—an impertinence which was permitted in\r\norder to test its powers. It constricted my fingers as tightly as if\r\na strong cord were wound round them, and when not thus occupied it\r\nwriggled and twisted itself about in such energetic contortions that\r\nI could scarcely hold it. The activity and daring of the whole fry\r\nproved their perfect development. On another occasion the same species\r\nproduced eight, and on a third occasion thirty-three young ones, but of\r\nthese dates I am not quite sure. In some cases a few eggs were produced\r\nat the same time, but they were hard and bad and of the consistency\r\nof soap. The manners and actions of the three equally well-developed\r\nfamilies were similar. They were always on the defensive, and able to\r\nfight their own battles. When the keeper put his hand into the cage,\r\nthey seized upon it and held on with their teeth so tightly that on\r\nraising it they hung wriggling and undulating like a living, waving\r\ntassel.\r\n\r\nAnother boa from Panama, on 30th June 1877, had twenty young, which\r\ndisplayed ability to take care of themselves forthwith by leaving\r\nthe marks of their teeth on Holland’s fingers. These twenty were all\r\nproduced during the night, or before the arrival of the keeper the next\r\nmorning, and were lively and spiteful, biting any one who attempted\r\nto touch them, and sharply enough to draw blood. Mr. E. W. Searle,\r\nwho described them in _Land and Water_ at the time, July 1877, said:\r\n‘This is probably the first recorded instance of the breeding of boa\r\nconstrictors in captivity.’ He seemed also to infer that this proved\r\nthe boa to be viviparous instead of oviparous, as ‘had been always\r\nunderstood.’ Having already known of cases of abnormal, and also of\r\npostponed production of eggs or of young, I ventured at the time to\r\ncite such cases in _Land and Water_, July 7, 1877, adding: ‘We must not\r\ntoo hastily conclude that because one boa constrictor produced a family\r\nof lively young ones, this species is invariably viviparous.’ Also in\r\nthe _Field_, July 14, 1877, I suggested that ‘the circumstance might be\r\nreceived rather as a further example of snakes breeding under abnormal\r\nconditions,’—opinions further confirmed by subsequent observations.\r\n\r\nThe little fry were supplied with young mice, which they constricted\r\nas if they had served an apprenticeship; but the mother left them\r\nentirely to themselves, and betrayed no other unusual feelings than to\r\nhiss when disturbed. When they were seven weeks old, they in one night\r\nate twenty-four mice and a few young rats between them. They all cast\r\ntheir first coat before they were a week old. The mother had been in\r\nthe Gardens about eight years. All but one of this fine family were\r\nalive in the following November, and two are still living at the time\r\nof going to press, viz. ‘Totsey’ (illus. p. 201) and one brother.\r\n\r\nThe dates of these few following cases are a little uncertain, also\r\nexactly how many survived of those that were born.\r\n\r\nA ‘seven-banded’ snake (_Trop. leberis_) had six.\r\n\r\nA ‘chicken snake’ (_Col. eximius_).\r\n\r\nA ‘moccasin snake’ (_Tropidonotus fasciatus_) had nine young ones.\r\nThis species has sometimes produced young and eggs at the same time.\r\n\r\nA ‘garter snake’ (_Tropidonotus ordinatus_).\r\n\r\nA boa constrictor had eight pretty little active snakelings that at\r\ntwo days old pretended to constrict my fingers, and forcibly enough to\r\nprove their powers.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions at the Gardens within the time specified, hybrids have\r\nbeen born between _Epicratis angulifer_ and _Chilobothrus inornatus_,\r\nand I can but think that occurrences of this nature must happen among\r\nsnakes in their wild state occasionally, which may throw some light on\r\nthe perplexities of classifiers.\r\n\r\nIn August 1878, three were born alive; and in recording the event the\r\nSecretary to the Zoological Society, P. Lutley Sclater, Esq., Ph.D.,\r\nF.R.S., etc., writes that there can be no question as to the pairing\r\nof these two snakes, both in the same cage, and as there was no male\r\n_Epicratis_ in the collection. Three were alive and six bad eggs were\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nIn September 1879, two more hybrids were born between the same pair;\r\nwho, at any rate, remained constant to each other.\r\n\r\nOf the venomous serpents that have fallen under my own notice at\r\nthe Zoological Gardens, the little Indian viper (_Echis carinata_)\r\nhad three young ones in July 1875. Only two survived a few weeks.\r\nThey changed their coat at an early day, but ate nothing; nor did\r\nthe mother, who soon died. One may mention here that the vipers in\r\ncollections rarely do survive long after giving birth to young. This\r\nmay be only owing to an unhealthy condition in captivity, but merits\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nFour common adders (_Vipera berus_) and several broods of the Daboia\r\nhave also been produced.\r\n\r\nThe African viper of the coloured illustration is another example, as\r\nhaving afforded opportunities for observation.\r\n\r\nIn point of numbers we find the families varying from three or four\r\nto upwards of a hundred. When the parent is in health, the young\r\nare produced easily and rapidly. _Vipera nasicornis_ deposited her\r\nforty-six children within about three hours. A Java snake (though\r\nnot in our London Ophidarium) produced twenty-four young ones in\r\ntwenty minutes. Anaconda, in April 1877, on the contrary, exhibited\r\nconsiderable protraction, extruding bad eggs at irregular intervals for\r\nmany days. She will form the subject of the next chapter.\r\n\r\nIncubation, or the hatching of eggs by the maternal warmth, seems not\r\nto have been suspected by ophiologists until a comparatively recent\r\ndate; but by the non-scientific, the barbarian and the untutored\r\nnatives of hot countries, who see, but dream not that in future ages\r\nwhat they saw and incidentally spoke of would be of weight to the\r\nenlightened of as yet unexisting nations,—by such the fact was known\r\nlong ere its worth _as a fact_ was recognised. Yet, as has been already\r\nseen in these pages, evidence given without intent and purpose often\r\nis of scientific importance. Aristotle spoke of incubation; but with\r\nclassic writers the difficulty of sifting fact from fable may cause the\r\nwhole to be rejected.\r\n\r\nWe owe to Zoological Societies and menageries the confirmation of\r\nthe _couvaison_ of at least one species of serpents. Subsequently we\r\nare told, ‘The python only incubates,’ this snake being generally\r\nmentioned as the one exception; and only within a very few years has\r\nmaternal affection been accredited to any others. Mr. P. H. Gosse was\r\ninformed by the negroes in Jamaica of the habits of the yellow boa. Sir\r\nJoseph Fayrer was informed by the jugglers that ‘over and over again\r\nthey had dug cobras out of their holes _sitting on their eggs_.’ Dr. E.\r\nNicholson was informed ‘on trustworthy authority that the Hamadryad has\r\nbeen found coiled upon a nest of evidently artificial construction.’ He\r\nthinks snakes always watch over their eggs, and frequent the locality\r\nwhere they have deposited them. The keeper at the Gardens confirms\r\nthis by his own observations. ‘They do care for their eggs in their\r\nown way,’ he assured me, and display unusual irritability and wildness\r\nat such times.[130] In menageries, however, their habits are always\r\nmore or less artificial; they cannot seek spots for themselves, or\r\nexercise maternal instinct beyond doing the best they can under the\r\ncircumstances. Anything in the way of extra indulgences, such as soft\r\nrubbish, moss, or sand, is duly appreciated when eggs are about to be\r\ndeposited, and we find maternal ophidians resort at once to this.\r\n\r\nIn a footnote, vol. xvi. p. 65 of the _Annales des sciences\r\nnaturelles_, we read:—‘_Il parait que l’incubation des serpents\r\nest un fait si connu dans l’Inde, qu’il entre même dans leur contes\r\npopulaires. M. Roulin m’a fait remarquer dans le second voyage de\r\nSindbad le marin_ (_nouvelle traduction Anglaise des ‘Mille et une\r\nnuits’ par W. Lane_, tom. iii. p. 20) _le passage suivant: Alors je\r\nregardai dans la caverne, et vis, au fond, un enorme serpent endormi\r\nsur ses œufs_.’\r\n\r\nHere again, by accident, an ophidian habit known in the 8th century has\r\nbeen revealed to the scientific of the 19th century.\r\n\r\nIn the 17th century, when the Royal Society was founded and scientific\r\ninformation of all descriptions was welcome in their published\r\n_Transactions_, the subject of serpent brooding appeared in those\r\npages. In vol. i. p. 138, a few terse words exactly express what modern\r\nophiologists have of late years verified. ‘Several have taken notice\r\nthat there is a difference between the brooding of Snakes and Vipers;\r\nthose laying their Eggs in Dung-hills by whose warmth they are hatched,\r\nbut these (Vipers) brooding their Eggs within their Bellies, and\r\nbringing forth live Vipers. To which may be added,—That some affirm to\r\nhave seen Snakes lye upon their Eggs as Hens sit upon theirs.’ This was\r\npublished in 1665.\r\n\r\nThe truth of ophidian incubation in at least one species was finally\r\nestablished at the _Musée d’Histoire_ at Paris in 1841, when _Python\r\nbivittatus_ or _Python à deux-raies_—named from two black lines\r\ndiverging from the mouth—incubated her fifteen eggs. This celebrated\r\nserpent has enriched zoological annals in several points of interest.\r\nShe assisted to confirm the question of whether snakes drink, and, as\r\nwill be seen, whether they will take dead food. In connection with\r\nthe present subject, the observations made by M. Dumeril during her\r\nincubation in the months of May and June 1841 are of such interest\r\nthat I will translate from a paper read at the _Academy of Sciences_\r\nin Paris, by M. Valenciennes, 19th July 1841, and published in the\r\n_Annales des sciences naturelles_, tom. xvi. 2^{me} série, p. 65. It\r\nwill be remembered that M. Dumeril (to whom we are indebted for the\r\nmost complete work on _Erpétologie générale_ that graces the shelves of\r\nour Great National Library) was at that time Professeur d’Erpétologie\r\nau Musée de Paris, and specially charged with the management of that\r\npart of the menagerie.\r\n\r\nM. Valenciennes began his paper by reminding his audience that the\r\ntemperature of birds rises in various degrees during the period of\r\nincubation, proposing the questions, ‘Do reptiles not offer a similar\r\nphenomenon?’ ‘Do they never brood on their eggs?’ As far as was known\r\nof native reptiles, the answer would be in the negative. However, M.\r\nLamarrepiquot, in his travels in Chandernagor and the isle of Bourbon,\r\nseems to show that a large serpent of India, and some other species,\r\n_se plaçait sur ses œufs et les echauffait en developpant pendant ce\r\ntemps une chaleur notable_. Many eminent naturalists doubted this,\r\nuntil it was confirmed in the Paris python, in which was an example of\r\nprolonged and uninterrupted incubation for the space of fifty-six days.\r\n\r\nM. Valenciennes proceeded to describe that she was in a cage with\r\nothers, and that a temperature higher than the outside air was\r\nmaintained. During January and February she coupled several times,\r\nand in February ate six or seven pounds of raw beef that was tied on\r\nto a live rabbit of middling size. Food offered her afterwards, for\r\nthree weeks in succession, she refused; but, as described in chap.\r\niv., she drank no less than five times during her brooding. Sloughing\r\noccurred on the 4th April. Generally gentle and quiet, she became\r\nexcited on the 5th May, and tried to bite any one who approached her.\r\nHer condition being evident, she had been left alone and undisturbed\r\nin her cage; and at six o’clock on the morning of the 6th of May, laid\r\nan egg, fourteen others being deposited by half-past nine A.M. The\r\neggs were soft at first, of an oval form, and an ashy-grey colour,\r\nbut afterwards became rounder and of a clear white. They were all\r\nseparate. She collected them in a cone-shaped pile, and rolled herself\r\nround them, so as to completely hide every one, her head being at the\r\nsummit of the cone. For fifty-six days she kept perfectly motionless,\r\nexcepting when manifesting impatience if any one attempted to touch\r\nher eggs. Notwithstanding this want of trustfulness on the part of the\r\ninteresting invalid, M. Dumeril achieved some important experiments\r\nregarding her temperature.\r\n\r\nReptiles are ‘obedient to the surrounding temperature,’ we may repeat,\r\nbut in the present instance there was warmth in her perceptible to\r\nthe touch (_une chaleur notable_). The temperature of the cage was\r\n20° (Reaumur?), that under the woollen coverlet where she reposed\r\nwas 21°; but in her coils, where M. Dumeril inserted one of the best\r\nthermometers that could be procured, she was 41°, and always of a\r\nhigher temperature by some 20°. Placing the thermometer either upon\r\nher or between the folds of her body, only a slight variation was\r\nperceptible, but it was invariably higher than the surrounding air.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of July one of the shells split (_la coque s’est\r\nfendillée_), and the head of a little python appeared. During that\r\nday the little creature only twisted about within its shell, now its\r\nhead, now its tail being visible outside, and withdrawn again. The next\r\nday the wee snake made its debut altogether, and began to crawl about\r\n(_s’est mise à ramper_). It lost no time in exploring to the remotest\r\ncorners of its blanket, and by degrees showed itself to the world.\r\nDuring the next four days eight were similarly hatched, the seven\r\nremaining eggs, at various stages of development, having apparently\r\nbeen crushed by superincumbent weight.\r\n\r\nThe mother, on the 3rd of July, ate six more pounds of beef, after her\r\nfast of nearly five months; but with the posterior part of her body\r\nstill folded over the eggs. She then quitted them, and displayed no\r\nfurther care, having covered them for so long a time, and even defended\r\nthem with such assiduity. From ten to fourteen days after being\r\nhatched, the young ones all changed their coats, and then ate some\r\nlittle sparrows, throwing themselves upon them, and constricting them\r\nlike grown-up pythons.\r\n\r\nM. Valenciennes drew attention to the circumstance that only in hot\r\ncountries do serpents incubate their eggs, _i.e._ only the serpents\r\nindigenous to hot countries. In temperate ones, where the average\r\nwarmth is insufficient, they resort to artificial heat; as, for\r\ninstance, manure heaps, or decaying vegetation.\r\n\r\nThus was this important question settled, and the hatching of the young\r\nbrood in Paris became a chronological era in ophidian annals.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore, in January 1862, twenty-one years afterwards, a python\r\n_seba_ in our own Gardens laid upwards of a hundred eggs, immense\r\ninterest and curiosity were excited among the zoologists of the day,\r\nfor here at home in London was a grand opportunity for observing the\r\none only snake which at that time was supposed to exhibit any sort of\r\nmaternal instinct. Plenty of damp moss had been supplied to her, the\r\ntemperature maintained in the cage being supposed sufficient for her\r\nwell-being. She pushed the moss into a kind of nest, and when the ‘long\r\nstring of eggs’ were deposited, she arranged them in a nearly level\r\nmass, and then coiled herself over and around them so as to hide and\r\ncover them as much as possible. Sometimes she changed her position a\r\nlittle, and re-arranged her eggs, and in various ways rendered herself\r\nworthy of record.\r\n\r\nOphiologists had scientific facts to verify: this opportunity must\r\nnot be neglected for ascertaining whether so cold a nature, and in\r\nmidwinter, could produce sufficient warmth by lying there day after\r\nday upon her bushel of eggs. So thermometers were ever and anon thrust\r\nbetween her coils, or held close to her; first here, then there, after\r\nthe example of M. Dumeril in Paris. Other disturbances in the way of\r\ncleaning out the cage and supplying her companion in captivity with\r\nfood and water were angrily resented by the poor patient, who had no\r\nchance of the tranquillity that she would have sought for herself in\r\nher native tropics. Besides which, the chances against hatching were\r\nfar greater in her case than in the Paris and Amsterdam pythons. The\r\nformer saved only eight out of her fifteen, and here we had, in round\r\nnumbers, one hundred, more than she could successfully cover at one\r\ntime. Moreover, a most untoward accident happened one night by the tank\r\noverflowing among her eggs, necessitating a complete disturbance of\r\nthem. What wonder, then, that she was irritable and even savage during\r\nthe whole time of her incubation! One egg, examined fifteen days after\r\nit was laid, contained a living embryo, so there were hopes of some\r\nat least maturing. For more than seven weeks she remained patiently\r\nbrooding, when all hope of hatching any of the eggs had vanished, and\r\nit became necessary to take them from her. This was done by degrees,\r\nand the task was no easy one. The keeper watched his opportunity to\r\nraise the sliding door at the back of the cage, make a snatch at those\r\nnearest him, and shut down the slide with celerity, or the exasperated\r\nmother would have seized him. He nearly got his arm broken more than\r\nonce by the despatch he was compelled to use. Sometimes, so quick was\r\nshe, that in thrusting down the slide she was nearly jammed by it.\r\nHolland protected himself by holding up a corner of the rug so as to\r\nhide himself when he had occasion to open the slide door; yet one day\r\nshe ‘jumped’ at him, seizing the rug, and with a toss of her head\r\njerking it back with such violence that a shower of the gravel came\r\nhailing upon the glass in front of the cage, to the consternation and\r\nalarm of the spectators gathered there, and who at the moment imagined\r\nthe glass was broken, and that the infuriated reptile would be among\r\nthem. But they were behind her; it was only towards the keeper that her\r\nfury was directed: he had taken away the last of her eggs. When, then,\r\nhe shut down the slide, she kept her angry eyes fixed upon it for a\r\nlong while. Presently she sought in her empty nest, upon which, so long\r\nas any eggs had remained to her, she had re-settled herself after each\r\nirruption. At last she took to her bath, in which she remained for a\r\nlong while.\r\n\r\nAfter the scenes witnessed during those seven weeks, no one could doubt\r\nthe existence of maternal affection; and this was worth proving, as\r\nsome authors would have persuaded us that snakes, and particularly the\r\nnon-venomous ones, manifest total indifference regarding their eggs.\r\nThe other important fact, an increased temperature, was also again\r\nobservable, proving that a serpent can really hatch her eggs by the\r\nwarmth of her own body.\r\n\r\nLast summer, 1881, another python laid about twenty eggs at the London\r\nOphidarium, but, alas! neither were any of that brood hatched. For\r\nfuture broods, now that the fact of a raised temperature has been\r\nproved, the next scientific triumph will be to develop the young ones,\r\ndispensing with thermometers, and substituting perfect tranquillity,\r\nwith every possible aid and comfort to the mother.\r\n\r\nThat snakes under these peculiar circumstances do appreciate little\r\n‘delicate attentions,’ ample proof has been afforded in the Jamaica\r\n‘yellow boa’ (_Chilobothrus inornatus_), the species which on several\r\noccasions has produced broods in London, and the one in which Mr. P.\r\nH. Gosse verified the marvellous instinct of withholding its eggs when\r\ncircumstances were not propitious for their deposition. This is one of\r\nthe ‘Colubri’ alluded to by T. Rymer Jones, ‘which may at pleasure be\r\nrendered’ (_i.e._ render themselves) ‘viviparous by retarding their\r\nlaying.’\r\n\r\nBut when Gosse published his work on Jamaica (1851), he did not appear\r\nto be aware of what Jones and Cuvier had said on this subject, but\r\nstated the result of his own observations. He had become convinced that\r\nthis species of snake forms a sort of nest, and incubates its eggs;\r\nwhen subsequently, one that he had in captivity produced living young,\r\nhe was staggered. ‘Is it possible,’ he wrote, ‘that a serpent normally\r\noviparous, might retain the eggs within the oviduct until the birth of\r\nher young, when circumstances were not propitious?’\r\n\r\n‘Is it possible,’ again asks an American naturalist, so lately as\r\n1879,—‘can it be true that _Heterodon platyrhinos_ and _Tropidonotus\r\nsipedon_’ (both harmless) ‘are sometimes viviparous and sometimes\r\novoviviparous?’ This writer, F. W. Cragin, had been told that the two\r\nabove species were ovoviviparous (a word of no value as a definition),\r\nand he writes in the _American Naturalist_, vol. xiii. p. 710, that out\r\nof twenty-two eggs of Heterodon, ploughed up out of the sand in Long\r\nIsland, one he put into alcohol to preserve it as found, and the others\r\nwere hatched on the fourth day, showing that sometimes at least it is\r\noviparous, as supposed are some of the _Eutænias_.\r\n\r\nMr. Gosse describes one Jamaica boa in confinement, that was ill\r\nand inactive, refusing food. It was unusually vicious, and bit hard\r\nenough to draw blood, the effect of the fine teeth being like a severe\r\ncat-scratch. It rendered itself further offensive when disturbed, by\r\nemitting an insufferable odour, and at length gave birth to living\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nThat this snake when at liberty lays eggs, he had seen, and in a nest\r\nof artificial construction. One that he knew of was excavated in a\r\nbank. The snake was seen issuing from a narrow passage just large\r\nenough to admit it. Dry, crumbled earth had been discharged at the\r\nentrance of the passage, where it lay in a heap. The bank being dug\r\ninto, the passage was found to lead to a cavity lined with soft\r\nrubbish, leaves, etc., which must have been carried there. Mr. Gosse\r\ndoes not pretend to affirm positively that the snake constructed that\r\nsecluded nest for itself. It might have done so, pushing out the mould\r\nby the lateral undulations of its body, as the burrowing snakes do,\r\nand carrying back the soft trash in its mouth or, if it only chose a\r\nnest formed by some other animal, this proved maternal care. There\r\nwere eggs in the nest, the shell being like ‘white kid.’ ‘On snipping\r\none, a clear glaire exuded, in which was a large, whitish vitellus,\r\nstained with blood vessels, and containing a young snake seven inches\r\nlong, but immature.’ One fœtus writhed. The fœtus being formed and\r\ncapable of motion, proved, Mr. Gosse thought, that the eggs had been\r\nsome time laid. Incubation is a characteristic of that family, the\r\nauthor affirms. Of the various cases he knew, one female boa brought\r\nforth eleven snakes. In another snake that was killed, ten or twelve\r\nfully-formed young ones were found.\r\n\r\nOne of these ‘yellow boas’ in a private collection displayed unusual\r\nrestlessness and uneasiness, crawling about its cage as if in search\r\nof something. Those who had the care of it suspected that she was with\r\neggs, and supplied her with fine sand. This appeased her somewhat, and\r\nafter twirling herself around to form it into a kind of nest, she laid\r\nsome eggs. One of the same kind at the Gardens accepted gratefully some\r\nsoft cotton wool which a lady brought for her and her young progeny,\r\nall of whom nestled themselves in it contentedly and speedily.\r\n\r\nTwo other noteworthy cases have to be recorded, but they shall form the\r\nsubject of the ensuing chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n_ANACONDA AND ANGUIS FRAGILIS._\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMUS and MINIMUS. Yet by right of its name _Anguis_, our little\r\nslow-worm—truly a lizard—claims a place in these pages; by right\r\nof form also, and by right of promise; and still further, because on\r\nthe authority of some of our eminent physiologists there is in the\r\ndentition of some of the boas an affinity with lizards; and inasmuch\r\nas this little limbless lizard affords a good example of those whose\r\nancestry, as Huxley tells us, found it profitable to do without their\r\nlegs and become snakes, she shall be introduced in company with the\r\nlargest of all her ophidian cousins.\r\n\r\nAnaconda also, in having vestiges of hind limbs, affords in these\r\nanother example of what Darwin calls atrophied organs, remnants of what\r\nwere once, no doubt, a pair of very excellent saurian legs.\r\n\r\nIllustrious naturalists who were authorities in their day—as, for\r\ninstance, Linnæus and Cuvier—included slow-worms with serpents, the\r\nlinks between them being so close. They have also been included among\r\nthe burrowing snakes, many of which have no better right to the name\r\nof _Anguis_. With the advance of herpetology more minute distinctions\r\nof classification occur, and anatomy now proves in the ‘brittle snake’\r\na stronger relationship to lizards than to serpents. It has eyelids,\r\nlike the lizards; no palate teeth, non-extensible jaw-bones, and more\r\nconsolidated head-bones; so that you never see the facial distortion\r\nin these lizard-snakes when feeding, that is so striking in the true\r\nophidians. It has scales alike all round, and also a distinct neck and\r\na vestige of sternum and pelvic bones whence formerly two pairs of legs\r\nproceeded. From an evolutionary point of view, therefore, it is even in\r\nadvance of Anaconda, which has still its ‘spurs’ to get rid of.\r\n\r\nSpace need not here be occupied in a recapitulation of other features\r\nand the manners and habits of _Anguis fragilis_ beyond what the subject\r\nin hand demands; and in connection with this our two anguine heroines\r\nwill be found to display one other striking feature in common. For the\r\nrest, in Bell’s _British Reptiles_ it is treated at length. In Wood’s\r\n_Natural History_, also, there is a long and minute account of the\r\nslow-worm, including details of a most interesting character, as being\r\ngathered from personal observations.\r\n\r\nAnaconda, however, claims historical priority.\r\n\r\nAs a water snake it has already been partially described (p. 228), and\r\nsome of its synonyms were given in explanation of its scientific name\r\n_Eunectes_, to trace its right to be included among the water snakes,\r\nand _murinus_, to show the nature of its food. Being a native of\r\ntropical America—which embraces many extensive countries and includes\r\nnumerous tribes of the aboriginal inhabitants—this serpent is also\r\nknown under numerous vernaculars, puzzling enough to the reader of\r\ntravels who does not at first sight realize that the book in which he\r\nnow reads of the _Matatoro_ describes one region, and the volume in\r\nwhich he has read of the _Sucariuba_ or of the _Jacumama_ describes\r\nanother, and that these are one and the same snake. The spelling and\r\npronunciation of even the same word among adjacent tribes add to the\r\nperplexity. Among other of Anaconda’s familiar vernaculars, which we\r\nmeet with in all South American books of travel, are _Aboma_, _Cucuriù_\r\nor _Cucuriubù_, _El trago venado_, _Camoudi_ or _Kamoudi_, _Sucurujù_,\r\nand others. The name by which it is now generally known, _Anaconda_, or\r\n_Anacondo_, was fixed by Cuvier in 1817.\r\n\r\nVery exaggerated ideas as to its size have obtained, probably traceable\r\nto Waterton, who tells us the Spaniards of the Oroonoque positively\r\naffirm that he grows to the length of from seventy to eighty feet; and\r\nthat as his name _Matatoro_ implies, he will eat the largest bull.\r\nBefore yielding full faith to such stories, we must ascertain whether\r\nthat ‘bull’ corresponded in dimensions with our Durham prize ox, or the\r\nminiature bovines of the Himalayas. Hartwig improves upon Anaconda’s\r\ndinner capacities in telling us that the ‘Hideous Reptile will engulph\r\na horse and its rider, or a whole ox’ (prize ox, no doubt) ‘as far as\r\nits horns.’\r\n\r\nTurn we to science and to ocular proof of what Anaconda really is—for\r\nthere are and have been living examples in our zoological collections,\r\nand whatever she may have been ‘formerly,’ her modern dimensions rarely\r\nexceed thirty feet.\r\n\r\nIn the present case her interest lies in her maternal aspect, for\r\nit is the one that was brought to London in 1877 of which we now\r\nspeak, and who astonished the ophiological public by giving birth to\r\nfully-developed young ones in April of that year.\r\n\r\nIn _Land and Water_ of the preceding February, Mr. Frank Buckland\r\ndescribed the arrival of this snake at Liverpool in a box, which with\r\nits occupant weighed over 2 cwt., and of the necessary examination\r\n‘he’ (the snake) was obliged to undergo by Mr. Bartlette previous to\r\npurchase. Being at length conveyed to the Zoological Gardens, ‘he’ was\r\nreported as being thin and as having no inclination to feed, but glad\r\nto remain in ‘his’ bath almost continuously.\r\n\r\nIt was brought from the vicinity of the Amazons, and must have been\r\ncramped up for many months in this close prison. No wonder it turned at\r\nonce into its native element, although the small tank restricted its\r\nmovements almost as much as its travelling box. The poor thing was seen\r\nto be suffering discomfort, presumably from its long journey and close\r\nconfinement; and one day, when endeavouring to extend itself and move\r\nmore at ease in the narrow space between the tank and the front glass,\r\nit forced out the entire frame by the power of its coils. Fortunately\r\nthe huge python and two other Anacondas in the same cage at the time\r\nwere in a torpid condition; or had those four powerful snakes been\r\nlively or spiteful, and all at liberty at this crisis, grave results\r\nmight have accrued. Aid being at hand, the loosened frame was promptly\r\nre-adjusted; but this practical illustration of Anaconda’s powers was a\r\nuseful lesson to snake keepers.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar condition of this snake not being suspected, not even\r\nher sex, the appearance of two fully-developed though dead young ones\r\non April 2d was an important event in the Ophidarium, and one to be\r\nforthwith chronicled in the _Zoological Society’s Proceedings_. The\r\nsecretary, at the ensuing meeting, exhibited the two young Anacondas,\r\nand afforded some interesting details concerning the mother. During\r\nthe next few days four more young ones were born, but all dead; and\r\nduring several weeks, others in a high state of decomposition were\r\nproduced. ‘She might have had a hundred!’ said the keeper, who felt\r\nfully persuaded that she had voluntarily ‘kept them back.’ Four were\r\nwell developed; one was partly coiled in the ruptured shell, which was\r\nof a tough, coriaceous texture, white, and as thick as orange peel.\r\n\r\nOccurrences of this nature send us to our book-shelves. The python and\r\nsome of the boas had laid eggs, and Anaconda might have been expected\r\nto do the same, as we read in the papers that wrote ‘leaders’ on the\r\nevent. But suddenly we all discover (‘_we_’ second and third rate\r\nnaturalists, who regard the biological professors at a respectful\r\ndistance, and aspire only to a printed half column in a similarly\r\naspiring journal),—we all discover that Cuvier had long ago pointed\r\nout that _l’Eunect murin_ is viviparous (like the regular water\r\nsnakes), and that Schlegel had subsequently confirmed the fact from\r\npersonal observation. Thus we learn as we go.\r\n\r\nThose born dead in London offered no exception, therefore, to the rule,\r\nbut were rather to be regarded as one of those cases in which the\r\nmother, under circumstances unpropitious for the production of her\r\nprogeny, retards the deposition of her eggs or her young.\r\n\r\nLet us picture to ourselves the condition of this poor Anaconda. Just\r\nat the very time when instinct would have guided her to the spot most\r\nfavourable for the coming brood, she is transferred from her native\r\nlagoons, and crowded into a dark close box just large enough to contain\r\nher. Though without water for many months, this ‘good swimmer’ arrives\r\nalive, a proof of her astonishing powers of endurance; but she has now\r\nno morass, no lagoon or refreshing river in which to invigorate herself\r\nand aid her natural functions, and the young ones die unborn. The poor\r\nmother soon showed evidence of disease and suffering, and was after a\r\ntime mercifully put to death.\r\n\r\nThere was no possibility of ascertaining the period of gestation in\r\nher case, but there was every reason to regard it as one of postponed\r\nfunctions, and another illustration of that astonishing capability\r\ndescribed by ophiologists of snakes which ‘may at pleasure,’ _i.e._ at\r\nwill, retard the laying of eggs or birth of young!\r\n\r\nThe prejudice against snakes has been so strong, that there are persons\r\nwho would even exclude them from zoological collections. Should these\r\npages fall under the eye of such persons, they must admit that the\r\nOphidia in captivity present grand opportunities towards the attainment\r\nof scientific knowledge. These important results far outweigh the less\r\npleasing spectacles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now for our little _Anguis fragilis_, with all her wrong names and\r\nthe wrong impressions produced thereby, which, with some particulars\r\nof her behaviour in captivity, shall form the subject of the next\r\nchapter. Here she will, I think, be accepted among those examples of\r\nabnormal incubation which belong to the present one.\r\n\r\nSearching for the lovely little _Drosera_ and its attendant exquisite\r\nmosses on ‘The Common’ at Bournemouth (the one close to the town), on\r\nthe look-out for lizards also, I saw what at first sight appeared to\r\nbe an extremely long, black slug, lying on a smooth little patch of\r\ngrass in the sunshine. Approaching to inspect this shining nondescript,\r\nI at once recognised a slow-worm. Being not only entirely and deeply\r\nblack, but unusually short and proportionately thicker than any I had\r\never seen, the familiar ‘worm’ had not at first sight been identified.\r\nIts short, blunt tail had evidently lost an inch or two; and its bulk\r\nsuggested a speedy increase of family. Already I had four others and\r\na green lizard, the male _Lacerta agilis_, which I had also captured.\r\nThe date of ‘Blackie’s’ capture was August 26, 1879; the precise time\r\nbeing important, because, as just now stated, the period of gestation\r\ndepends much on the degree of external warmth that can be had to assist\r\nin maturing the embryo; and, as many of my readers will recollect, very\r\nlittle sunshine had we that summer. Chilly rains and cloudy weather\r\nmarked the season; and to this I attributed the fact that at the end of\r\nAugust the slow-worm was still enceinte, when, as Bell informs us, its\r\nordinary time to produce young is June or July.\r\n\r\nTaking her up, ‘Blackie’ struggled and kicked, if such a remnant\r\nof tail can be said to ‘kick’ (the action being very similar), and\r\ndisplayed activity enough to show that she could be quick enough when\r\noccasion required it. Knowing her shy, burrowing instincts, I at once\r\nlaid her on the mosses which filled my little basket, and down she\r\nretreated, there remaining without further trouble.\r\n\r\nDeposited in a box with the others, she acted similarly, remaining\r\nhidden under the sand and moss, and never showing herself on the\r\nsurface, as the rest did whenever a hopeful gleam of sunshine tempted\r\nthem. Just the tip of her little black, shining nose was sometimes\r\nvisible, as if she were getting a breath of fresh air on the sly.\r\n\r\nOne of the other slow-worms—already several weeks in my\r\npossession—had appeared to be in a similar condition, and was much\r\nwilder than the rest, effecting escape and circumventing me in a\r\nvariety of ways, while her companions were comparatively tame and\r\ncontented. The green lizard, also, had to be well watched, being\r\nexceedingly active, darting away like a flash whenever the cover of the\r\nbox was removed for an instant. Their cage was necessarily and cruelly\r\nsmall, in anticipation of a journey to London, and that I might have\r\nthem in my own keeping while on the move, which I expected to be for\r\nsome weeks. It was covered with a net secured by a strong elastic; but\r\nthey could easily reach the top, and managed most cleverly to push up\r\nthis net, and so get out. The way in which one of them called ‘Lizzie’\r\nachieved this, is described in the ensuing chapter. Here we must keep\r\nto our subject.\r\n\r\nThe box was generally close to an open window, in order to catch any\r\nchance ray of sunshine; but the truant propensities of the inmates\r\nnecessitated a frequent investigation, and a raking up of the moss\r\nand sand with which they were supplied, much too often for Blackie’s\r\npeace of mind. She continued wild and alarmed, defeating search by\r\nquick movements below. The ever active lizard, too, had frequently to\r\nbe hunted out; for whether he had retreated below, or had gone off\r\naltogether, could not be ascertained unless the box and its inmates\r\nwere turned out bodily to count heads—a species of roll-call not\r\ntending to tranquillize the unquiet pair. These trifles are mentioned\r\nto show the sort of life the poor little captives led for many weeks.\r\nThey were raked over or turned out literally topsy-turvy every few\r\nhours. Only at night had they any peace; for being well disposed\r\nreptiles, who kept regular hours and retired early to rest, but _not_\r\nrising betimes in the morning, they could be safely left uncovered\r\nuntil and unless sunshine enticed them upwards.\r\n\r\nAll ate and drank regularly but Blackie, who, so far as I was able to\r\nascertain, was a total abstainer.\r\n\r\nThus, in their incommodious box, they lived until the middle of\r\nOctober, when (after making visits on the way, and secretly harbouring\r\nmy ‘snakes’ like stolen booty) I arrived in London. At that time the\r\nsun seemed trying to atone for its summer deficiencies, and whenever\r\nany of its grateful warmth could be obtained through the London\r\natmosphere the lizards were deposited in a window, but Blackie remained\r\nalways below. Suddenly she also grew refractory. She got out of the\r\nbox, and had frequent falls from the table to the floor. So had the\r\nother restless one, necessitating still more frequent roll-calls, and\r\nbringing troublous times on themselves. I had observed in a former pet,\r\nthat when the season of hibernation was approaching, _Anguis fragilis_\r\nhad exhibited an errant disposition, and I had attributed it to a\r\nnatural instinct to seek a winter retreat; but in the present case only\r\nthese two tried to get away, and in both there appeared to be a similar\r\nmotive.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, late in October, Blackie could not be found for\r\nseveral days, and was even given up for lost, when, on removing a\r\nnumber of books that, when unpacked, had been temporarily stacked\r\nagainst the wall, there lay the little black slow-worm in so narrow a\r\nspace between a quarto volume and the wall that it seemed impossible\r\nshe could have got there. Strange to tell, the poor little thing no\r\nlonger struggled to get away, but seemed even glad to be lifted and\r\nfondled and restored to her moss.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd November, some frosty days having arrived, and no more\r\nworms and flies being procurable, I thought it time to put them away\r\nfor their winter sleep, having been so instructed by Mr. Green, the\r\ntaxidermist at Bournemouth, of whom I had purchased several. So, having\r\ndismissed all idea of an increase in their numbers, I prepared a large\r\ndeep jar and furnished it with soft hay, moss, and sand, enough for\r\nthem to burrow into, intending to consign it and them to an attic.\r\n\r\nThe first thing on the morning of the cold foggy 3rd of November\r\n1879, I went as usual to examine the box and its inmates—as yet in\r\nmy sitting-room. Lifting the moss to count heads, I saw what on the\r\nfirst glance in that half daylight seemed to be a small tender snail,\r\napparently injured in some way, and crawling extended in a wonderfully\r\nthin line from its shell. What presented a snail to my thoughts was\r\nbecause a few days previously—insects being now no more, and other\r\nfood hard to procure—my maid had brought in some small snails as an\r\noffering for the ‘snakes.’ These having been declined, I wondered to\r\nsee one in the box, but turned away faint-hearted from the unpleasant\r\nduty of removing a half-crushed snail, as I took it to be.\r\n\r\nAfter being fortified with a hot breakfast, daylight being now\r\nbrighter, I began with dainty fingers to remove the moss. Judge of\r\nmy amazement to find three of the loveliest little tiny scraps of\r\nlife, wriggling, twisting, diving, and defiantly—let me rather say\r\nintelligently, or instinctively—using their tongues like grown-up\r\nslow-worms. They were Blackie’s children. Not a doubt about it! Three\r\nwere free from the shell, one of which was still connected with it by\r\nan inch or more of the umbilical cord; and within the shell—a mere\r\nmembrane—was some yellow yoke and a good deal of glaire, so that the\r\nmembrane still retained the rounded form. Possibly I had ruptured\r\nthis egg in disturbing the moss. There was another egg quite perfect,\r\nand within that could be discerned the little creature curled up, and\r\npresenting those convolutions which in the half light had looked so\r\nlike a small snail shell. On tenderly taking up this perfect egg, the\r\nwee reptile within threw itself into such an agitation that it burst\r\nits prison house, and emerged prematurely into the cold, rough world. A\r\nyolk as big as a hemp seed and much of the glaire remained behind. It\r\nwas a precisely similar case to that of a young Typhlops in Jamaica,\r\ndescribed by Gosse, where the reptile ‘crawled nimbly out of a ruptured\r\negg, but remained attached to the vitellus.’ In the present instance\r\nthe umbilical slit was ominously gaping, showing that the poor little\r\ncreature was not nearly ready to battle with life. In the other that\r\nwas not yet wholly detached, the slit was less, and in the two which\r\nhad hatched themselves (no doubt during the night) it was nearly closed.\r\n\r\nDuring the day six more were born, and four of the six in the\r\nmembranous shell. _Anguis fragilis_ is always considered to be\r\nviviparous; but so are vipers, and here in three distinct cases under\r\npublic observation the young have been produced in a membranous\r\ncovering.\r\n\r\nThe activity of these tiny creatures was marvellous. If meddled with,\r\nthey seemed as if agitated by a galvanic battery. Their whole length\r\nvibrated with nervous irritability. In colour they were black beneath\r\nand a silvery white above, with a spot of black on the head, and a\r\nfine, thread-like line of black all down their back. The head was the\r\nlargest part, the body tapering gradually to the tail. They were in\r\nlength about 2-1/2 inches. Very bright black eyes had they, and manners\r\nlike the adults, pressing their head against the hand, or wherever\r\nthey were, with the instinct to burrow and hide. Their silvery aspect,\r\ntogether with their mobile susceptibility, was truly mercurial. To hold\r\nor retain them was simply impossible; as well try to restrain a stream\r\nof quicksilver. In a fury of agitation they would leap and turn over\r\nand twist themselves away like eels. Flaccid and tender and apparently\r\nboneless, the difficulty of taking up and restraining such shreds of\r\nvitality was no less difficult than interesting. The wee, half-matured\r\nfury that rushed impetuously into the world spent itself in restless\r\nefforts to dive into the earth. It grew gradually more feeble, and died\r\nthe third day. Altogether there were eight or more. Three were hatched\r\nbefore I saw them, the rest were produced in the membranous ‘shell,’\r\nand in all the shells the remains of the yolk were seen. A remarkable\r\nfeature was that these remains of egg all vanished in a manner that\r\nwholly baffled my investigations. The yellow yolk was too palpable to\r\nbecome absorbed in the moss and sand; it could not have escaped notice.\r\nWith the greatest care I searched and examined every spray of moss,\r\nevery blade of grass, over and over again, but could discern no trace;\r\nneither the skin nor any slimy glaire, nor one tinge of yolk, nor any\r\nglobulous collections of moisture whatever. Blackie did not eat them;\r\nfor she remained at the bottom of the box while the cares of maternity\r\nwere upon her, never moving. There was no possible doubt about her\r\nbeing the mother of the brood. Her companions in captivity came to the\r\nsurface as usual during an hour or two of sunshine, and then retired\r\nunderground.\r\n\r\nIn removing the moss that first day to look for Blackie, I saw by an\r\nenlargement at the lower part of the body that her family was still\r\nincreasing; and if such a creature _can_ appeal, the look with which\r\nshe feebly raised her head as if to entreat not to be disturbed, was\r\none not to be disregarded. So I left her unmolested the whole day, and\r\nindeed until she began to show herself and move about like the rest,\r\ncoming up if enticed by sunshine, and retiring early below, as they all\r\ndid daily.\r\n\r\nI communicated this interesting event to Mr. Frank Buckland at the\r\ntime, and to the editor of a zoological journal, inviting both to\r\ninspect the interesting family. I also sent a short account of the\r\nNovember brood to _Land and Water_. Mr. Buckland was, I believe, absent\r\nfrom town; and my MS. (now before me) was returned from _Land and\r\nWater_ for ‘want of space.’\r\n\r\nEvidently the November brood were after all but sorry little\r\nslow-worms, beneath the notice of scientific eyes, and unduly endowed\r\nwith imaginary importance in the estimation of their enthusiastic\r\nguardian!\r\n\r\nIn my careful examination of the contents of the cage next day, in\r\norder to ascertain the chance of yet other silvery shreds of life,\r\nI observed a little dry, globular substance, which had a somewhat\r\nsuspicious look. It was firm to the touch, and on breaking it, showed\r\na veiny sort of conglomerate appearance, as of layers or convolutions.\r\nSeveral of these hard, dry masses I afterwards found, all on being\r\nbroken presenting a similar appearance. Then it suddenly occurred to\r\nme that they must be dried-up eggs of the other slow-worm, and that\r\nshe must have deposited them some time previously. The surface of sand\r\nwas easily accounted for by the frequent turning over and stirring up\r\nof the soft rubbish in the cage. At first thinking only of Blackie,\r\nand being satisfied that these singular little masses contained no\r\nlife, I threw them away; when, too late, resolving to keep some and\r\ninvestigate their nature, only one more could be found; but this one\r\nwas preserved in spirits of wine, together with two or three of the\r\ntiny slow-worms. The female that conjecturally laid them had frequently\r\ngot out of the box and sustained many falls to the floor; which, even\r\nhad other circumstances been propitious, might sufficiently account\r\nfor the destruction of embryo life. But in addition to accidents were\r\nthe extremely cold and sunless summer and the ten weeks of disturbed\r\nand comfortless existence; and then the green lizard was for ever\r\nscrambling about and scratching the earth in all directions. He alone\r\nwas enough to make a conglomerate of the unmatured eggs.\r\n\r\nThe remaining one of the supposed eggs was put aside with other\r\nspecimens, and almost forgotten till the present time. Looking at it\r\nnow after it has been two years in the spirits of wine, I find the\r\nsandy surface washed off and deposited as sediment, and in a partly\r\ntorn and ruptured membrane behold a perfect little _Anguis fragilis_\r\nquite as big as those others which were hatched. Whether this happens\r\nto be a more perfect embryo than those that were hardened, or whether\r\nit has grown softer and more distinguishable through being in liquid,\r\nit is impossible to say, except that here it is. There were, then,\r\n_two broods_, as had been anticipated, and in both cases eight or\r\nnine. The precise date of the hard eggs is not clear; probably they\r\nwere produced first. The warmth of the room at length did for Blackie\r\nwhat the sun had failed to do; and even then her young ones were not\r\nfully matured. The other one, through many vicissitudes, in common\r\nwith her big cousin Anaconda, produced bad eggs. Truly are not these\r\ntwo—or say only one—is not Blackie’s case a verification of what the\r\nauthor of _British Reptiles_ affirmed of these slow-worms: ‘There is\r\nno doubt that the duration of the period of gestation must depend on\r\nthe temperature to which the animal is exposed,’ even if this be not\r\nanother instance of retarded deposition.\r\n\r\nA word more, in conclusion, about the tiny progeny.\r\n\r\nTo the touch having no more bone or substance than an earth-worm of\r\nthe same size, their ability to burrow seemed marvellous. When placed\r\nin the sunshine—such as there was of it—they basked in apparent\r\nsatisfaction, retiring betimes and working themselves underground to\r\nthe depth of four or five inches. Often two or more were missing,\r\nwhen every scrap of earth and moss had to be spread on a newspaper\r\nand minutely separated to search for them. Indeed, I have never felt\r\ncertain whether the family originally consisted of eight, nine, or\r\nten, having a strong suspicion that their grown-up relatives or the\r\nlizard had supposed them to be worms placed there for their express\r\ndelectation. And when, one day, the number was reduced to six, and the\r\ngreen lizard looked unusually plump and impudent, the young fry were\r\nquickly transferred to a separate home, a glass bowl, through which\r\nthey could be watched without molestation, and up which they could not\r\npossibly crawl. The smallest of worms (the weather being warm again)\r\nand a cockle-shell of water, the softest of sand and the prettiest of\r\nmosses, ministered to their comfort; but though they grew very slightly\r\nand their colour became more defined, I do not think they partook of\r\nfood or water during the whole six weeks that they were thus watched\r\nand cared for. One from the first day was always livelier than the\r\nrest. It was one of those that had been hatched first or possibly\r\nborn alive, being perfect, and with the navel closed when I had first\r\ndiscovered it. Through the glass we could see them deep down in the\r\nearth, and so close to the side that they could nearly always be easily\r\ncounted. Not at all sociable were the little ones, one here, another\r\nthere, as if getting as far apart as their home permitted. In the\r\nevening, if placed on the table near the lamp, they seemed to mistake\r\nthat for sunlight, and would come up and ramble restlessly about on the\r\nsurface for several hours. Their vitality was amazing.\r\n\r\nOne evening when showing them to a friend and permitting their antics\r\nupon the table, one of them was suddenly and mysteriously missing. We\r\nhad carefully guarded the edge of the table; indeed, they were well in\r\nthe centre of it, and it seemed impossible for them to fall off. We\r\nsearched the carpet, notwithstanding, and with most careful scrutiny;\r\nand finally deciding that the truant must have been replaced with some\r\nmoss unobserved, gave up the search.\r\n\r\nNext morning, on entering the room, my maid thus greeted me: ‘Lor’,\r\nMa’am! if I didn’t find one of your little snakes down on the carpet\r\nclose to your chair, and for all the world I as near as possible\r\ntramped on it. I put it in along with the others, and it worked its way\r\ndown in no time!’\r\n\r\nImagine that poor little shred of life passing the night in frantic\r\nefforts to burrow into the carpet and retire below according to custom!\r\nWhenever held or touched, their first impulse was to conceal themselves\r\nbeneath, and they would dive and butt with impetuous agitation in their\r\nendeavours to push themselves out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe event in the family had caused me to postpone the hibernating\r\narrangements; so as long as the others ate (a thaw enabling us to dig\r\nup worms again) and courted daylight, I kept them in the warm room. But\r\nas will be remembered, very severe frost set in that winter (1879-80),\r\nand no more worms could be dug up. While hibernating, no pangs of\r\nhunger could assail them; and though it cost me an effort to consign\r\nthose beautiful wee things to the cold and gloom of a temporary tomb,\r\nyet it seemed the kindest thing to do under the circumstances; so, in\r\ncompany with their unsympathizing mother and cousins, they were stowed\r\naway in moss and darkness, but in a box instead of the jar. Well!—that\r\nis all! My ignorance and its sad results were alluded to on p. 165. I\r\ncan only hope the poor little victims died insensible to their cruel\r\nfate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n‘_LIZZIE._’\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS tame slow-worm was promised a chapter to herself in my book, and I\r\ntrust my readers will not tire of her doings, but vouchsafe their kind\r\nattention to an exhibition of still other feats in which the little\r\n_Anguis fragilis_ vies with the Great Anaconda.\r\n\r\nIn her maternal aspect we have done with her. The heroine of the\r\npresent chapter was for a much longer time in my possession than\r\n‘Blackie’ and those other poor victims, and therefore tamer. When\r\nmy friends exclaimed, ‘Why on earth do you call that little snake\r\n“Lizzie”?’ the simple reply was: ‘Because she is not a snake, but a\r\nlizard.’ In what respects the slow-worm is a lizard my readers already\r\nknow; I will therefore describe what I hope may prove of zoological\r\ninterest. Already ‘Lizzie’ has ingratiated herself with the readers of\r\n_Aunt Judy’s Magazine_,[131] as also with her personal acquaintance for\r\nher gentle and innocent manners.\r\n\r\nFirst let us briefly review her many wrong names, ‘blindworm,’\r\n‘slow-worm,’ ‘deaf-adder,’ ‘brittle-snake,’ and endeavour to account\r\nfor them. Of her name ‘snake’ (_Anguis_), from its external aspect,\r\nenough has already been said. The ‘brittleness’ shared in common with\r\nseveral of her foreign relatives, known as ‘glass snakes,’ proceeds\r\nfrom a power of contracting the muscles into rigidity when molested:\r\nthat is, when, on finding themselves in a helpless condition,\r\nslow-worms grasp firmly whatever they can attach themselves to. In\r\nfact, this little snake only displays constricting powers as far as it\r\nis able; for it really does constrict the fingers which detain it, with\r\na force as great for its size as its cousin Anaconda uses in killing\r\nits prey. Were the giant constrictors to entwine us with proportionate\r\npower, they would gain the day. In the case of _Anguis fragilis_, _we_\r\nare the masters; and were we to attempt violently to unwind one from\r\nour fingers, it would break ‘in halves’ in its resistance, or rather\r\nin its redoubled efforts to cling the tighter and so save itself. May\r\nit not in this respect, also, claim kinship with its giant rivals, and\r\nshow their common ancestry? On pp. 183 and 187 reference was made to\r\nthe ‘blindworm’ in connection with other ‘brittle’ snakes, and in the\r\nuse of their pointed tails. Our native ‘blindworm,’ in not having the\r\nhard point at the end, has escaped the imputation of trying to ‘sting’\r\nwith that imaginary weapon, although it uses its tail with equal\r\nand similar force, and for the same purpose. In handling the little\r\nreptile, you will feel it pressing the tip of its tail against whatever\r\npart comes in contact with it, as a hold, a fulcrum, and motive power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lizzie; never at a loss.]\r\n\r\nUpon a smooth surface it would be entirely helpless without this\r\nassistant to progression, its scales being too even and polished to\r\nafford hold of any kind. You will see it sweeping its long tail this\r\nway and that, in search of some hold or obstacle against which to\r\npush itself forward; and failing this, the point is pressed close to\r\nthe table or floor as may be. When in any unaccustomed position, as,\r\nfor instance, when held in the hand, you will see the tail instantly\r\ntwining itself about the fingers for safety, the creature trusting\r\nitself entirely to its aid, and being helpless when its movements are\r\nfettered in any way. If not strictly prehensile in the way of affording\r\nsupport, as the tail of a true boa does, that of _Anguis fragilis_ is\r\nnot far removed from it. Hold one that is accustomed to be handled\r\nand in good health, and permit it to hang by the mere tip, as in the\r\naccompanying illustration. So far from falling, the little creature\r\nwill at once draw itself upwards and backwards with perfect facility,\r\ntill it feels itself equally balanced, when the tail will be sent in\r\nsearch of hold; it will cling quickly round a finger, and then _Anguis_\r\nfeels itself safe once more. My tame slow-worms accomplished this with\r\nperfect ease whenever so suspended.\r\n\r\nOthers, unaccustomed to such a position, or in a not very robust\r\ncondition, must be treated cautiously under this experiment, and not\r\npermitted to fall; but in every case the tail will be seen to be a\r\nvery important agent to the reptile. It is longer in the male than in\r\nthe female slow-worm—more than half the entire length in the former,\r\nand less than half in the latter. The males are, therefore, longer on\r\nthe whole, though the body itself is longest in the female. Regard\r\nshould be had to this, when, roughly speaking, they are said to ‘break\r\nthemselves in _halves_;’ because it is not the body which breaks, but\r\nonly the tail, or a portion of it, in common with other lizards.\r\n\r\nThe power of the tail in this reptile was again seen when its home was\r\na bell-glass, such as is used for gold-fish. The one in which my first\r\nfamily of slow-worms dwelt, was almost as high as their own length,\r\nso that I considered them sufficiently secure without any cover to\r\nit. But after a little while they effected an exit. _How_, was at\r\nfirst a mystery, until I saw them perseveringly raising themselves in\r\na perpendicular direction against the side. Many a slip and many a\r\ntrial had they, but they rarely desisted until success crowned their\r\nefforts. When their head had once gained the edge of the glass, they\r\neasily drew themselves up and over it, and let themselves down on the\r\noutside, as you would draw a cord over the edge. The perfect smoothness\r\nof the glass, the nice balance required, and the gradual lowering of\r\nthemselves, rendered this proceeding still more astonishing; for as\r\nthe glass was on a stand there was a considerable distance between\r\nthe edge and the table. A slow-worm’s progression is truly marvellous.\r\nIn this little creature one can detect no action of the ribs; they are\r\ntoo fine and too close. Its scaly armour, moreover, is smooth and firm;\r\nand as for ventral scutæ to ‘afford hold,’ it has none. Yet with ease\r\nit draws itself over that polished rim, as it draws itself up and over\r\nyour finger, when suspended by the mere tip of its tail.\r\n\r\nSoon the slow-worms accomplished this feat so knowingly that it became\r\nnecessary to cover them over, which was done with gauze having a strong\r\nelastic cord hemmed into it. They practised their climbing powers all\r\nthe same, and though not able to get over the edge, tried and pushed\r\nhard enough to stretch the gauze considerably; so that, unless well\r\npulled down, it lay only loosely and bagging over the top.\r\n\r\nJudge, then, of my amazement one day to find Lizzie _outside_ the\r\nglass, resting contentedly in the loose fold round the edge above the\r\nelastic. The little creature had absolutely got over the edge, but the\r\ntightness of the elastic baffling the outside descent, there it lay.\r\n\r\nIn _Nature_, vol. xx. p. 529, Mr. Hutchinson describes and illustrates\r\nan exactly similar feat accomplished by a ‘little snake’ nine inches\r\nlong. It was put in a glass jar ten inches high, having also for a\r\ncover a bit of coarse muslin secured by an elastic band. The reptile\r\nwas missing, the muslin and the band were intact, when, after a\r\nmysterious surprise and search, the little snake was found under the\r\nrim of the jar _inside_ the muslin. The writer does not say what snake\r\nit was, but he afterwards observed it ‘ascending easily,’ standing\r\non the tip of its tail, and supporting itself against the side of the\r\njar by the abdominal scales creating a vacuum, ‘like the pedal scales\r\nof a common house lizard;’ it was not a slow-worm, therefore. He felt\r\nquite satisfied about this adaptation of the scutæ, a mode which, in\r\ndescribing the larger snakes climbing up their glass cages, I called\r\n‘compressure,’ p. 215. Mr. Hutchinson does not tell us, either, how\r\nmuch earth or rubbish covered the floor of the jar, though there must\r\nhave been an inch or more, to enable a snake of nine inches to raise\r\nits head over a ledge ten inches high. Lizzie not having ventral scales\r\nto help her, used her tail only as a support, then nicely maintaining\r\nthe perpendicular. Many times she failed in achieving success, but she\r\ndid achieve it, and grew so enterprising in consequence that I shall\r\nnow confine my story to her. At first she lived in a box, the top of\r\nwhich she could easily look over, and she was occasionally permitted\r\nto get out and ramble among some ferns on the same table. Sometimes\r\nthis box was also covered with a muslin, having elastic hemmed into it,\r\nand she soon discovered that this with persevering attempts could be\r\nraised. The use of the tail was here remarkable. With it she maintained\r\nher ‘stand,’ so to speak, while with her head and the forepart of her\r\nbody she tried to loosen the net; using persistent and powerful efforts\r\nto lift it, by repeatedly tossing back her head. She acted in every\r\nway as if determined not to be baffled, and with an apparent intention\r\nor reflection that was, without doubt, the result of experience. In\r\nhigher creatures this application of force to produce a certain result\r\nwould be pronounced ‘intelligence.’ In the little slow-worm there was\r\nundeniably a perception of cause and effect. On one occasion when she\r\nhad got her tail on the edge of the box, and her whole length in the\r\nstretched muslin along the top, she so far succeeded with the forcible\r\naction of the head that she worked the very strong and tight elastic\r\nup, but not at all to her own satisfaction; for it instantly contracted\r\nunder her, bagging her most effectually. She was caught in a trap of\r\nher own construction.\r\n\r\nSeeing her so wonderfully energetic, and by no means ‘slow,’ either in\r\naction or intelligence, the next thing was to ascertain whether Lizzie\r\nwas ‘deaf’ in addition to her other pseudo-failings; but by the various\r\ntests used to exercise her aural faculties, I am inclined to think her\r\npowers of hearing served her almost better than those of sight. When\r\npermitted to ramble among the plants and over the table, the _sound_\r\nmuch more than the _sight_ of her box and its contents attracted her.\r\nNever averse to go home and retreat into her moss, the rustling of this\r\nor the scraping and rubbing the sides of the box—any _noise_ with it\r\nwith which she was familiar, would cause her to turn towards it, when\r\nthe sight of it alone failed to entice her. After a time she turned\r\nher head, if even from across the room I made a sudden and sharp noise\r\nto attract her attention,—such as the tapping of a spoon against a\r\ncup, or the peculiar talk I indulged in for educational purposes. She\r\nundoubtedly became familiar with certain sounds, which were repeated\r\ntill she did look round. Not—as I am bound to confess—that it was a\r\nstrikingly intelligent look! rather the contrary, I fear: still, as the\r\nobject was to test her powers of hearing, the result was satisfactory.\r\nThe origin of this reputed deafness is difficult to conjecture. In\r\nthe way of external ears, those of the slow-worm are less distinct\r\nthan those of lizards generally, but more so than in snakes, which\r\nhave no visible aural apertures; whereas in the slow-worms they can be\r\ndiscerned if sought for, though they are very small and indistinct.\r\n\r\nNot much less perplexing is the supposititious ‘blindness’ of\r\nthe slow-worm. This must have had its origin in days long before\r\n‘gentle-folk’ took rural walks for the purpose of observing natural\r\nobjects; long before Shakspeare’s time, and when slow-worms were far\r\nmore numerous than now. Probably those who saw most of them were the\r\npeasantry, and that in winter time, when, in their out-door work, they\r\nwould discover a number hibernating. A score or two of slow-worms in\r\ncompany with a few snakes and adders brought to light in turning up\r\nstones or earth, would attract the rustics, when a stray one in summer\r\ntime would pass unnoticed or, at any rate, unexamined. Though the\r\nlarger reptiles would be equally torpid, their eyes would show all the\r\nsame, while the slow-worm’s eyes would be so tightly closed that their\r\nplace could hardly be found. Thus they were presumably ‘blind.’ This\r\nis mere conjecture in seeking a reason, but ‘blind worms’ they were in\r\nEngland long before the _typhlops_ (p. 187) of the tropics was known,\r\nand long before any other ‘naturalist’ than Topsell and his like wrote\r\nupon ‘Serpentes’ and the _Amphisbæna Europæa_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lizzie in a knot.]\r\n\r\nTopsell, by the way, whom we quoted on the subject of tongues, thought\r\nhe knew all about slow-worms, and gave them credit for a length and\r\npower of tail far exceeding those of the present day. ‘They have been\r\nseen to suck a Cow, for then they twist their Tailes about the Cowe’s\r\nLegges. The Slow-worm biteth mortallie, and the Cow dyeth!’ Consistent\r\nthis with the ‘Blind-worm’s sting’ of the poet of that day. Of the six\r\nor seven that have been in my keeping at one time or another, not one\r\nhas, under any provocation, attempted to bite me. They were handled\r\ncontinually, twirled about, and tied into knots (with gentle treatment,\r\nof course), but not one of them ever broke itself in ‘halves’ or opened\r\nits mouth with malice intent. Lizzie sometimes in winding about my\r\nfingers got herself into very pretty knots, and in such tied-up fashion\r\nwhen placed on the table she would remain motionless for a time, and\r\nthen begin to move away. Curious was the effect at this juncture. The\r\nknot was not loosened at all; but as the little reptile began to move,\r\nthe knot passed downwards, and she crawled out of it, while its form\r\nremained the same to the very end of the tail. It was similar to what\r\nwe saw when the little four-rayed snakes constricted their birds;\r\nthe form of their coils altering no more than would a slide passed\r\nalong a rope. Neither did such a knot disturb Lizzie. She appeared\r\nquite unconscious of it, and simply crawled out of it. Perhaps any\r\n‘brittleness’ discoverable may have been from rough handling, as one\r\ncan easily suppose a too abrupt untwining of the reptile when clinging\r\nround the fingers would so alarm it that it would cling the tighter.\r\nA gentleman assured me that he had seen one break in ‘halves,’ and\r\nthe two portions lying on the table. Not being a scientific observer,\r\nhe could not describe the appearance of the fractured part, except\r\nthat they seemed to contract; and this is what I have observed in the\r\ntail of lizards when accidentally abridged. The owners do not appear,\r\nhowever, to concern themselves about it.\r\n\r\nThe name ‘worm’ given to this little reptile is merely as a creeping\r\nthing, a ‘worm of the earth,’ in common with many other small crawling\r\ncreatures which are not earth-_worms_. Its quality of ‘slowness’ is\r\nonly another name for caution. Quick and active it can be; but in\r\nretreating down among the moss or hay, or whatever you provide in its\r\ncage, then you see the perfection of slowness. Not a blade stirs, not a\r\nsound is heard, and one may repeat here that the manner of progression\r\nin _Anguis fragilis_ is not the least of all the ophidian wonders we\r\nhave witnessed. In the earth it can burrow itself to the depth of\r\nseveral feet. In soft rubbish it simply vanishes slowly; its hard,\r\npolished scales permitting it, as it were, to slide down into and among\r\nthe hay with that gently gliding motion which enables us to perceive\r\nhow very well it does manage without the ancestral limbs.\r\n\r\nOne other name it has, ‘adder,’ which, perhaps from association with\r\nthe true adder or viper, has gained it its evil character of being\r\nvenomous.\r\n\r\nBut this word ‘adder,’ like ‘worm,’ was formerly used for many creeping\r\nthings, and is derived from old Saxon and Danish words _atter_,\r\n_eddre_, _ætter_, etc., and the German _natter_, which has a similar\r\nsignification, any low-lying or crawling creature. Even in this\r\nnineteenth century the ‘slow-worm’ still bears an evil character in\r\nsome rural districts, and in Wales more particularly.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, a Welsh lady, hearing me speak of my tame slow-worms,\r\nasked if I were not afraid to handle them.\r\n\r\n‘Why?’ one naturally asked.\r\n\r\n‘Because they are so poisonous,’ she replied.\r\n\r\nI explained that this erroneous idea had probably originated in the\r\nlittle creature being sometimes called an ‘adder,’ and so forth.\r\n\r\nMy friend did not take the explanation kindly, but rather resented the\r\npossibility of her being mistaken. ‘They are so very common in Wales,’\r\nshe said, ‘and I am sure they are venomous there.’\r\n\r\nAnother lady of the company, subsequently speaking of this, remarked,\r\n‘I should certainly be inclined to believe what Miss F. says about them\r\n(the slow-worms), because she lives so much in the country and is such\r\nan observer.’\r\n\r\nThis speaker was a lady of really superior intellectual attainments;\r\nbut she had never attempted to overcome a strong prejudice against\r\nanything in the shape of a snake. She would not _permit_ herself to be\r\nconvinced that any of them were either harmless, clean, or beautiful;\r\nbut, like the monks who would not look through Galileo’s telescope, for\r\nfear of seeing what it was heresy to believe, my friend preferred to\r\nhug her prejudices!\r\n\r\nOne little bit more of gossip in taking leave of Lizzie. The party\r\nwere young gentlemen, all of them of studious and intellectual tastes\r\nand good position. ‘How _could_ I endure to touch those horrible slimy\r\nsnakes?’ one of them exclaimed, on hearing a lady inquire about my\r\npets. I assured him they were as clean and dry as the ruler on the\r\ntable. The young gentlemen exchanged dubious glances, and nearly all of\r\nthem attributed to my undue partiality the assurance that they were not\r\n‘slimy.’ ‘I always thought they were,—didn’t _you_?’ they said to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA word must be added on the subject of skin-shedding in the slow-worms,\r\nvarious processes having been described; as that it is ‘always shed in\r\npieces,’ ‘always splits on the head first,’ etc. As no two of my pets\r\ndoffed their coats at regular periods, or precisely in the same manner,\r\nI judged that, as in snakes, the sloughing depended principally on\r\nthe health of the individual, or the temperature. They all invariably\r\nbegan at the lips, rubbing their heads till the skin separated round\r\nthe mouth exactly as snakes do, and then crawled out of it. In one\r\ncase the skin was shed _unreversed_ throughout the entire length. This\r\nwas pushed off and left behind in a crumpled form, but in picking it\r\nup it extended uninjured to its original length, perfect from mouth\r\nto tail. Others were reversed as far as the tail, which slipped out\r\n‘like a sword out of its scabbard,’ as described by Mr. Bell; others\r\nwere reversed throughout the length. Sometimes they were in pieces, and\r\nthis was, I think, attributable to insufficient moisture. One did not\r\nchange after August; others changed several times during the summer; so\r\nthat there appears to be the same sort of caprice, or more probably of\r\nunascertained causes for variable processes, in casting the cuticle as\r\nin snakes.\r\n\r\n‘Lizzie’s’ bibulous propensities were mentioned p. 89. In vain was she\r\ntempted with milk, but water appeared to be almost more necessary than\r\nfood; at least, after being deprived of both, she took that first and\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\nSo much has been said of the burrowing habits of the slow-worms, that\r\nI must mention a remarkable exception. Never did I see mine _ascend_,\r\nexcept when attempting to escape; nor, when placed among the plants on\r\na flower-stand, did they ever _raise_ their head, but would work their\r\nway downwards, clinging and holding on by their tail till they reached\r\nthe floor. Always _down_ was their instinct, even down the stairs on\r\nseveral occasions; never up. But since the completion of this chapter,\r\nsome slow-worms have been deposited at the Zoological Gardens that\r\nevince a climbing tendency; and this strikes me as being so novel a\r\nfeat that I add a line. The little creatures—one of which is of a pale\r\nflesh-colour, almost white—live in a cage with some tree frogs, behind\r\nthe door on entering the Reptilium. Here they are, May 1882, often seen\r\nlodged in the branches of the shrub, and reposing there at ease, as if\r\nin quiet enjoyment. The ‘white’ one I first observed in the tree, and\r\nsubsequently others. So frequently may they be seen reposing in this\r\nway among the leaves, that to climb seems to have become a confirmed\r\nhabit or taste; and in concluding the history of _Anguis fragilis_, I\r\nrecord this singular diversity of habit as one other strong feature in\r\ncommon with the giant Anaconda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n_DO SNAKES AFFORD A REFUGE TO THEIR YOUNG?_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE question, ‘Do vipers swallow their young in times of danger?’ is\r\none less easy to solve to the satisfaction of the unbelievers than\r\nsome of the preceding inquiries, because the proof demanded is an\r\nalmost unattainable one. ‘Bring me a viper with its mouth tied up,\r\nand all her young ones in her _throat_, and then I will believe you,’\r\nsay the sceptics. Now, in the first place, a man does not go hedging\r\nand ditching, or to reap corn, nor does a gentleman go to his field\r\nsports, or for a country stroll, ready provided with a cord and a bag\r\nand an assistant for the express purpose of capturing maternal vipers,\r\nwho at sight of him receive all their little ones into their mouths;\r\nand, in the second place, if he did so, making it the one business of\r\nhis walk to seek for and entrap such vipers, he might spend a great\r\nmany summers in the search before his trouble was rewarded. Even were\r\nhe so fortunate, it is doubtful whether he would be believed by all\r\npersons; for viper-swallowing, like ‘the Great Sea Serpent,’ has been\r\na subject so contemptuously dismissed that investigation is arrested,\r\nand few in England would now risk their reputation by committing their\r\nnames to print in connection with it. It is much to be regretted that\r\nthis has of late years been the case with several English publications\r\nwhose columns should be open to a fair examination of evidence on\r\nall zoological questions. The influence of such journals, therefore,\r\nchecks progress; for until prejudice is got rid of, there can be no\r\nadvancement in any science.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the late Mr. Frank Buckland was to the last sceptical\r\non this question. His specialty was not ophiology; but the mass of\r\nreaders do not stop to inquire about this; and he, being a popular\r\nwriter as well as a popular character, was accredited by thousands who\r\nquoted him, while themselves no naturalists, nor in any position to\r\nform an independent opinion. Some contemporary journals unfortunately\r\ndisplay the same prejudices, even at the time of writing, causing\r\nzoological publications, which should embrace every branch of biology,\r\nto be devoted almost exclusively to the specialties of an editor.\r\n\r\nHappily this scepticism is not universal. In the American publications\r\ndevoted to zoology, information in every branch is welcomed as worthy\r\nof consideration; and though truth has often to be sifted out from a\r\nvery gigantic pile of rubbish, still it is worth the search; and we\r\ncan but feel that the rapid advance of our Transatlantic relatives in\r\nevery branch of science is due, in a great measure, to the dismissal of\r\nprejudice and to the encouragement of every new idea.\r\n\r\nSo far as snakes are concerned, their field is wide, it is true. In\r\nEngland our observations are limited to our one viper, whereas America\r\nis the land of snakes, no less than are India and Australia; and while\r\nour native viper is growing rarer every year, the opportunities for\r\nobservation in the Western World are wherever a new settlement is\r\nplanted.\r\n\r\nThus, when, in February 1873, Professor G. Browne Goode, of Middletown\r\nUniversity, Connecticut, invited, through the columns of the _American\r\nAgriculturist_, all the authentic information that could be procured on\r\nthe question, ‘Do snakes swallow their young?’ he received, as he tells\r\nus, no less than 120 testimonies from as many persons in various parts\r\nof the United States that single season.\r\n\r\nThe area in which information was collected included twenty-four States\r\nand counties, ‘almost all the evidence being valuable.’\r\n\r\nProfessor Goode was intending to bring the subject before the _American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science_, to convene at Portland,\r\nMaine, the following August; and he spent the summer in collecting\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nAt that session of 1873, in the Biological Section of the Association,\r\n‘A Science Convention on Snakes’ was held, and a paper was read\r\nby Professor G. Browne Goode, the subject offered for discussion\r\nbeing—‘_Do snakes offer a temporary refuge for their young in their\r\nthroats, whence they emerge when the danger is past?_’ On this occasion\r\nthe chair was occupied by Mr. F. W. Putnam, one of the editors of the\r\n_American Naturalist_, and secretary to the Association. Professor\r\nJoseph Lovering was the new President on Professor Lawrence Smith’s\r\nretiring; and among those who took part in the discussion were several\r\neminent naturalists New York and other journals published reports of\r\nthe Convention at the time; and the entire paper by Professor Goode was\r\ngiven to the world in the Annual Reports of the _American Association_.\r\n\r\nFrom these I will condense the principal matter, quoting also from a\r\npaper on the same subject written by F. W. Putnam in vol. ii. of the\r\n_American Naturalist_ for 1869. Indeed, the two accounts are so blended\r\nthat I can only recommend both to the perusal of the interested reader,\r\nProfessor Goode having reproduced much from Putnam’s paper in the\r\n_American Naturalist_, which, as he informs us, was the first that led\r\nhim to take an interest in the subject.\r\n\r\nHe began by reminding his audience that it had long been a popular\r\nbelief that the young of certain snakes seek a temporary protection\r\nfrom danger by gliding down the open throat of the mother, though it\r\nhad been of late doubted by so many naturalists as to be classed among\r\nthe superstitions; but that now a summing up of the evidence would show\r\nconclusively that the popular idea is sustained by facts.\r\n\r\nThe traditions of the North American Indians show that the belief has\r\nprevailed with them from prehistoric times. In England also, as he\r\nreminded us, as early as the sixteenth century, allusions to it are\r\nfound in Spencer’s _Faerie Queene_, 1590, Canto I. vv. 14, 15, 22, 25.\r\nFrom this a word or two only need be quoted regarding the\r\n\r\n  ‘Half serpent, half woman,’\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n  ‘One thousand young ones sucking upon her poison dugs,’\r\n\r\nwhen she is disturbed in her dark cave:\r\n\r\n  ‘Soon as that uncouth light upon them shone,\r\n  Into her mouth they crept, and suddaine all were gone.’\r\n\r\nAgain, in Sir Thomas Browne’s _Pseudoxia_, or ‘Vulgar Errours,\r\npublished in 1672, we find: ‘For the young ones will upon any fright,\r\nfor protection run into the belly of the Dam. For then the old one\r\nreceives them into her mouth, which way, the fright being passed, they\r\nwill returne againe; which is a peculiar way of refuge.’\r\n\r\nHe quotes from the _Humorous Lieutenant_ of Beaumont and Fletcher the\r\nwords, ‘This is the old viper, and all the young ones creep every night\r\ninto her belly.’\r\n\r\nThe Professor also mentioned the American traveller, Mr. Jonathan\r\nCarver, who, towards the end of the last century, recorded that he had\r\nseen a large brood of young rattlesnakes retire for safety into the\r\nthroat of the parent, which he killed, when no less than seventy young\r\nones made their escape. Practical experience demands, How had he time\r\nto reckon up these active, wriggling, tangled fugitives? Nevertheless\r\nhis story found favour and has been subsequently recited as probable.\r\nChateaubriand believed the fact, and glowingly expatiates on the\r\n‘Superb Reptile which presents to man a pattern of tenderness.’ ...\r\n‘When her offspring are pursued, she receives them into her mouth:\r\ndissatisfied with every other place of concealment, she hides them\r\nwithin herself, concluding that no asylum can be safer for her progeny\r\nthan the bosom of a mother. A perfect example of sublime love, she\r\nrefuses to survive the loss of her young, for it is impossible to\r\ndeprive her of them without tearing out her entrails.’ Elsewhere, with\r\nless of admiration for the exemplary _crotalus_, Chateaubriand says,\r\n‘By a singular faculty the female can introduce into her body the\r\nlittle monsters to which she has given birth.’\r\n\r\nOne of the early writers who witnessed this offer of refuge was M. de\r\nBeauvoir, who saw a disturbed rattlesnake open her jaws to receive five\r\nyoung ones. This amazed spectator retired to quietly watch the result,\r\nwhen, after the lapse of some minutes, the mother snake recovered\r\nconfidence, and she again opened her mouth and ‘discharged’ her little\r\nfamily. Professor Palisot de Beauvoir was an eminent French naturalist\r\nof the beginning of this century, and the author of _Observations sur\r\nles serpents_, published in _Daudin’s Histoire naturelle_, Paris,\r\n1803. He was accepted as an authority on many other points of natural\r\nhistory; and it is not improbable that he influenced Cuvier’s belief in\r\nthe ophidian maternal refuge.\r\n\r\nIt certainly does seem incredible that an occurrence so unprecedented\r\nshould have been conceived of in the first instance without some ocular\r\ndemonstration of it.\r\n\r\nAnother American traveller, whose testimony Professor Goode considered\r\nof worth, was St. John Dunn Hunter,[132] who saw young ones rush into\r\nthe rattlesnake’s mouth, and reappear when ‘the parent gave a sort of\r\ncontractile motion of the throat as a sign that danger was past.’\r\n\r\nComing down to our own times, Professor Goode mentioned Dr. Edward\r\nPalmer, of the Smithsonian Institute of Washington, a well-known\r\ntraveller and collector, who in Paraguay saw seven young _crotali_\r\nrun into their mother’s mouth. After the snake was killed, they all\r\nran out. The parent and her brood are now in the National Museum at\r\nWashington, D.C. Similar occurrences were witnessed by Professor\r\nSydney J. Smith, of Yale College; the Rev. Chauncey Loomis, M.D.,\r\nof Middletown University; Dr. D. L. Phares; Mr. Thomas Meham of\r\nPhiladelphia; a member of the Convention then present; and other\r\n‘gentlemen whose statements as naturalists were not to be doubted.’\r\n‘Due weight should be given to the wide distribution of the witnesses\r\nand the remarkable concurrence of their statements,’ said the speaker.\r\n\r\nProfessors Wyman and Gill, and other physiologists then present, showed\r\nthat there is no physical reason why young snakes should not remain\r\nfor a time in the body of the mother. The gastric juice acts slowly\r\non living tissues, and as for respiration, it is almost impossible to\r\nsmother reptiles. ‘Snakes can live for a long time immersed in water,\r\nand even in bottles hermetically sealed, and why not in a place of\r\nrefuge?’ argued Mr. Putnam. Instances were given of frogs escaping\r\nfrom the stomach of snakes; also of other snakes swallowed by a larger\r\nspecies returning to the light of day.\r\n\r\nAs a habit, if the swallowing ‘is not protective there is no parallel;\r\nif protective, a similar habit is seen in some fishes of the South\r\nAmerican waters, of the genera _Arius_, _Bagrus_, and _Geophagus_,\r\nwhere the males carry the eggs for safety in their mouths and gill\r\nopenings.’ Mr. Putnam instanced the Pipe-fish (_Syngnathus Peckianus_),\r\nwhose young when in an aquarium have been seen to go in and out of the\r\npouch of the male fish; and that a belief prevails among some sailors\r\nthat young sharks which suddenly disappear have gone into the mouth of\r\nthe mother. Some South American fishes carry their eggs in their mouth,\r\nand why should there not exist an equally motherly regard on the part\r\nof snakes?\r\n\r\nMr. F. W. Putnam, secretary to the Association, had made himself\r\nacquainted with all the English ‘viper-swallowing’ literature of\r\nany importance up to the date of his paper on the subject in the\r\n_American Naturalist_, 1869. Previous to that date, _Science Gossip_,\r\nthe _Field_, the _Zoologist_, and other English journals had devoted\r\nmore space to the subject than subsequently; and from these Mr.\r\nPutnam cited many records from intelligent observers, in proof ‘that\r\nsnakes _do afford refuge to their young_.’ Of especial importance,\r\nas corroborative evidence, were the statements and anatomical\r\ninvestigations of Dr. Edwardes Crispe, F.Z.S., etc., who had for a long\r\nwhile been studying the physiological possibility of such a retreat.\r\nOn the question, Would not the young snakes be rapidly digested in the\r\nstomach of the parent? this anatomist showed that they would not come\r\nin contact with the gastric juice at all, and that there is ample room\r\nin the expansile œsophagus to receive them. He had made experiments\r\nwith various snakes by filling the stomach with water, in order to\r\nascertain its capacity in bulk. In 1855, Dr. E. Crispe had read a paper\r\non this subject at one of the meetings of the Zoological Society, and\r\nagain in 1862, when his previous opinions had become confirmed. He\r\nhad ‘positive evidence enabling him to state with certainty that the\r\nEnglish viper and some other venomous snakes do swallow their young at\r\nan early period.’\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the last century, Gilbert White, in his _History of\r\nSelborne_, refers to the prevalent theory, and the instances recorded\r\nby him are by the earlier editors of his works regarded rather as\r\nevidence than the contrary. In the edition of 1851, the editor Jesse,\r\nhimself a naturalist, took pains to ascertain facts concerning vipers,\r\nand he believed in the evidence given him. He had found vipers in their\r\nmother’s ‘stomach’ (he does not say oviduct) ‘of a much larger size\r\n(seven inches) than they would be when first excluded.’\r\n\r\n(In the later editions of the _History of Selborne_, it is much to be\r\nregretted that doubts are again thrown on the subject; and this in face\r\nof the opinions of men of eminence, who had written from observation,\r\nand had physiologically shown the possibility of such a refuge.)\r\n\r\nMr. Putnam also quoted Mr. M. C. Cooke, the author of _Our Reptiles_,\r\nand at that time editor of _Science Gossip_. Here is a herpetologist\r\nwell able to form an unbiassed opinion, and who in his work says on\r\nthis question: ‘Men of science and repute, clergymen, naturalists, in\r\ncommon with those who make no profession of learning, have combined in\r\nthis belief. Add to these, gentlemen whose statements in other branches\r\nof natural history would not be doubted.’ Among them were Henry\r\nDoubleday, Esq. of Epping, a well-known entomologist; the Rev. H. Bond,\r\nof South Pellerton, Somerset; T. H. Gurney, of Calton Hall, Norwich,\r\na well-known ornithologist; and several others of similar scientific\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nCuriously, no one appears to doubt a similar maternal instinct as\r\ndisplayed in our little native lizard, _Zootica vivipara_! Mr.\r\nDoubleday related the case of one being accidentally trodden upon,\r\nwhen three young ones ran out of her mouth. It was immediately killed\r\nand opened, and two others that had been too much injured by the foot\r\nto make their escape were still within the parent. At the time when\r\na controversy on the viper question was going on, Mr. Edward Newman\r\nedited the _Zoologist_, and he himself related a most confirmatory case\r\nof this viviparous lizard. A gentleman who was collecting, caught one\r\nwith two young ones; all three were consigned to his pocket _vasculum_.\r\nOn reaching home the two young ones had disappeared, and the mother\r\nlooked in such goodly condition that he thought she must have made a\r\nmeal of her offspring. Next morning, behold! there were the two little\r\nones and their devoted parent all safe and sound. She had sheltered\r\nthem within her body! And, as Mr. Newman added, ‘the narrators are of\r\nthat class who do know what to observe and how to observe it.’\r\n\r\nIn May 1865 a clergyman in Norfolk communicated to _Science Gossip_\r\nthat he had seen six or seven young vipers run helter-skelter down\r\ntheir mother’s throat. He killed the parent and ‘out came the little\r\nones.’ In July another correspondent of the same paper saw several\r\nyoung vipers vanish in a like manner, adding, ‘By the way the mother\r\nopened her mouth to receive them, he would say they were accustomed to\r\nthat sort of thing.’ Mr. J. H. Gurney recorded that a viper with young\r\nones was disturbed, when two of the latter ran into her open mouth, the\r\nsecond one after getting half in wriggling out again. The viper was\r\ncut open to seek a reason for this, when a recently swallowed mouse\r\nwas found stopping up the way. The first had managed to get into safe\r\nquarters, but the second could not pass.\r\n\r\nIn Oct. 1866 the question was revived by Mr. Thomas Rider, who wrote\r\nto the _Field_ newspaper that on September 21st he had seen a number of\r\nlittle vipers about three inches long run down their mother’s throat.\r\nHis account was followed by a number of letters from various persons,\r\nwho very lamely tried to convince him that his eyes had deceived him;\r\nthat what he had seen was the wriggling tongue, and a good deal more\r\nof such feeble talk, which Mr. Rider took in gentlemanly good-humour.\r\nHe further described that at first he clearly saw the young ones _at\r\na distance_ from the parent; that, the latter being killed, the young\r\nwere found _within_ her; that in carrying her, two of them had _fallen\r\nout of her mouth_; that he felt quite sure that what he stated was\r\ncorrect. His description was so graphic and evidently truthful that\r\nthe distinguished naturalist Thomas Bell wrote also to the _Field_ to\r\nexpress his great satisfaction at so authentic an account, confirming\r\nhis own previous impressions. ‘I did not doubt the fact before,’ he\r\nsaid, in the _Field_ of October 27th, 1866, ‘but such an attestation as\r\nthis from such an authority’ (an educated country gentleman) ‘must be\r\nconsidered as settling the question.’\r\n\r\nFor the next few weeks in the Natural History columns of the _Field_\r\na number of letters from various persons appeared, the majority\r\ntaking up the cudgels to resent the insult offered to Mr. Rider and\r\nthe eminent herpetologist Thomas Bell, F.L.S., F.R.S., and one of the\r\nCouncil of the Zoological Society; and to quote still other cases of\r\nviper-swallowing. ‘Only a purblind, stupid person,’ wrote one of them,\r\n‘could possibly mistake young vipers for a tongue.’\r\n\r\nJ. Scott Hayward, Esq. of Folkington, Sussex, wrote that three of his\r\nmen while haymaking found a viper, and one of them crushed its head\r\nwith his boot. A young viper ‘scrabbled’ about his boot after its\r\nmother. They then cut off the viper’s head, and seven young vipers\r\ncrawled out at the neck. The other had been too late, but was evidently\r\ntrying to follow the rest. There was no possibility of mistaking\r\nseven little vipers for one hair-like tongue in this case; but a man\r\n‘convinced against his will,’ etc., and therefore the editor again\r\nabruptly closed the subject.\r\n\r\nOf the hundred or more instances occurring in America, and now\r\npresented to the assembly, those considered of especial interest\r\nwere published in the Reports of the Association; and after some\r\nfurther discussion Professor Gill said that he considered the evidence\r\nsufficient to finally decide the matter. ‘Since many important facts in\r\nbiology are accepted on the statements of one single observer, these\r\ntestimonies are claimed to be sufficient to set the matter for ever at\r\nrest.’\r\n\r\nThis was the conclusion arrived at by the members of the American\r\n‘Science Convention on Snakes,’ in 1873.\r\n\r\nOf the witnesses introduced on that occasion, Professor Goode dismissed\r\nthose who had only _found_ the young snakes within the parent, but had\r\nnot _seen_ them enter. ‘Let us not trust to untrained observations,’\r\nhe said; those whose testimony was accepted being, in addition to the\r\nwell-known men already mentioned—‘an intelligent class of farmers,\r\nplanters, and business men, intelligent readers of an agricultural\r\nmagazine.’ ... ‘The well-attested cases included many non-venomous\r\nspecies, the habit probably extending to _all those which are known\r\nas oviparous_, as well as the _Crotalidæ_. The examples embraced the\r\ngarter snake, _Eutania sirtalis_ and _E. saurita_; the water snake,\r\n_Tropidonotus sipedon_; the rattlesnake, _Caudisona horridus_; the\r\ncopper-head and moccasin, _Ancistrodon contortrix_ and _piscivorus_;\r\nthe “_Massasauga_,” _Crotalus tergiminus_; the English viper, _Pelias\r\nberus_; and the mountain black snake, _Coluber Alleghaniensis_.\r\nProbably all the _Crotalidæ_ might be included. It remains to be shown\r\nwhether the habit extends to the egg-laying snakes, but as yet no\r\nproof had occurred. The Professors then present invited still further\r\nobservations and reports, affirming that the breeding habits of more\r\nthan twenty-five of the North American genera were entirely unknown.’\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of the cases recorded.\r\n\r\nA ‘water moccasin’ (probably _Ancistrodon piscivorus_) had been seen\r\nfor several days unwelcomely close to a southern residence. A gentleman\r\nwishing to entice her away from the water so as the better to kill her,\r\nhad a rabbit placed near, which by and by she seized and had nearly\r\nswallowed, when those on the watch made a noise to alarm her. She\r\nquickly disgorged it, gave a shrill whistling noise, and five young\r\nsnakes ran from under a log down her throat. The men cut off her head\r\nand found the five young which tried to get away.\r\n\r\n‘A farmer who was mowing saw a number of little snakes and a large\r\none. He went a short distance to fetch a fork to kill them, and on his\r\nreturn found only the large one left. He struck it on the back, and\r\nseven ran out of her mouth.’\r\n\r\n‘Another farmer saw a “striped snake,” and noticed a number of young\r\nones near to her head. He alarmed them, and the young ones rushed in\r\nat her open mouth. He stepped back and watched to see what next would\r\nhappen, when presently some of them came out. He killed the mother, and\r\nall the rest ran out.’\r\n\r\nA gentleman in Ohio saw a water snake on a bank. He got a pole, and\r\nwith one stroke of it wounded her, but not so much as to disable her.\r\nShe instantly made for the water, swam about her own length, when\r\nshe ‘wheeled round’ with difficulty, and placing her under jaw just\r\nabove the level of the water, opened her mouth wide, when some ten\r\nor twelve young snakes ran or swam down her throat; after which she\r\nwent in search of a hiding-place. She was, however, killed and opened,\r\nand ‘about twenty’ living young snakes were found within her, ‘two or\r\nthree of which were seven or eight inches long.’ Out of the 120 cases\r\nrecorded, sixty-seven of the witnesses saw and described the actions\r\nso distinctly as to leave no doubt in the minds of their hearers; and\r\nof these, twenty-two heard the parents’ signal ‘whistle,’ or hiss, or\r\nclick, or rattles, according to the species observed.\r\n\r\nA man Charles Smith was ploughing near Chicago, when his plough caught\r\nand turned over a large flat stone (‘rock,’ as they call it there),\r\nexposing a very large rattlesnake and her young ones. The mother\r\nrattled the alarm, and all the young ones ran down her throat. Smith\r\nkilled the old one, and immediately the young ones began to crawl back\r\nfrom her mouth and were killed by him. Thirteen of them were five or\r\nsix inches long.\r\n\r\nSome of the witnesses, after killing the snake into which they had seen\r\nthe young ones retire, saw them shaken out again by dogs which had\r\nseized the mother. A few of the observers went on several successive\r\ndays to watch a certain snake that was known to have a nest close by;\r\nand on each occasion when alarmed, the young ran into the parent’s\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nMr. Putnam also mentioned a ‘striped snake’ (which he had considered\r\novoviviparous) bringing forth live young ones at the end of August; she\r\n‘having been a long while in confinement.’ (This was no doubt a case of\r\nretarded functions.)\r\n\r\nIn vol. iii. of the _American Naturalist_, 1870, an interesting record\r\nof the ‘blowing snake’ (_Heterodon platyrhinos_) appears. One of\r\nthese snakes had been wounded in her side, and over one hundred young\r\nones from 6 to 8 inches long came forth from the wound. They were\r\nall active, all blowing and flattening their bodies like thoroughly\r\nwide-awake _Heterodons_. Sixty-three of them being uninjured died in\r\nalcohol, thirteen were much lacerated, as was the mother, and the rest\r\nescaped. Says the narrator, ‘We _know_ that this snake is oviparous.\r\nHad she swallowed them, or can she be also ovoviviparous?’ (Well, she\r\nmight be either or both as occasion demanded!) This is one of those\r\nexamples which might have given rise to the supposition handed down by\r\nAristotle, and explained p. 431.\r\n\r\nOne hundred snakelings from 6 to 8 inches long seems almost incredible\r\nfrom the space they would occupy. Yet in bulk they would not be more\r\nthan one large snake which the mother could easily swallow. The\r\naccommodating ribs render such habits more feasible than at first sight\r\nwould appear. _Heterodon platyrhinos_ is a wonderfully prolific snake.\r\nIn the _Zoological Society Proceedings_, vol. vi. 1869, S. S. Ruthven\r\nstates that he has observed it to bring forth over one hundred _live_\r\nyoung at a time.\r\n\r\nOne more example shall be added, of what Professor Goode considered a\r\nremarkable instance of hereditary instinct. In a hay-field was found\r\na nest of eggs, one of which was cut open, when a small but perfectly\r\nformed ‘milk adder’ within immediately assumed a menacing attitude\r\nand ‘brandished’ its tongue. Some of the other eggs were then torn\r\nopen, the young in which acted in a similar manner. Then the old snake\r\nappeared, and after endeavours to encourage this unexpected family,\r\nput her head on a level with the ground and opened her mouth, when the\r\nyoung ones vanished down her throat.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that in many of the above cases the mother\r\nsnake made a signal noise, that the young ones understood this\r\nsignal, and that she opened her mouth in a manner which they readily\r\ncomprehended. ‘This concurrence of testimony is not to be disregarded,’\r\nsays Professor Goode. And the reader will admit the force of these\r\nevidences. Those witnesses, dispersed over thousands of square miles,\r\nhad entered into no compact to make their accounts agree; nor did one\r\nspectator in Kansas know what another in New Jersey was looking at or\r\nwriting about.\r\n\r\nAfter such a weight of evidence, and in face of the decision arrived\r\nat by the American Convention, it is greatly to be lamented that\r\nthe _Field_, so far from advancing like our American friends, now\r\nretrogrades on this question. So lately as October 1881, when another\r\ncase was cited of the maternal refuge, the Editor closes his columns\r\nagainst investigation; and refuses to be convinced unless he were to\r\nsee ‘the young vipers at the Zoological Gardens obligingly run in\r\nand out of their mothers’ mouths,’ which is a performance we are\r\nnever likely to witness. For, in the first place, the young are often\r\nproduced in mid-day, in the presence of the crowd of visitors. Thus,\r\nfrom their birth accustomed to publicity, they have not the motive as\r\nwhen in their native haunts they are suddenly alarmed at the first\r\nsight of an apparition in human form. And in the second place, the\r\nyoung are generally removed at once into a separate cage, and they lose\r\nall knowledge of their mother. Both mother and progeny are familiar\r\nwith humanity; and the former is much more likely at the sight of the\r\nkeeper to open her mouth for a mouse than to invite her children to\r\nenter therein.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing portions of this volume I have been able frequently\r\nto bring personal observations to verify what books have taught me.\r\nWith the present subject this cannot be the case. I have neither seen a\r\nviper in the act of giving refuge to her young ones by receiving them\r\ninto her mouth, nor have I ever had the circumstance described to me\r\nby any one who has witnessed the proceeding. This is not surprising,\r\nseeing that my studies have been prosecuted almost entirely in London.\r\nFor any information obtained at the Gardens I am indebted solely to the\r\nkeepers, whose opportunities of observation when aided by intelligence\r\nand experience merit the confidence of the inquirer.\r\n\r\nSo astonishing a phase of ophidian habits—let us say only _reputed\r\nhabits_—was, however, to me one to excite very special interest, as\r\nwell as to induce inquiry and a possible solution of the mystery; and\r\ntowards this solution the facts related in chap. xxiv. and xxv. appear\r\nto me to come foremost in our aid. All snakes that are ovoviviparous,\r\nwas the decision arrived at by the American ophiologists; or\r\n_viviparous_, for we have seen that the two words have but little value\r\nas a distinction. I would venture so far as to render it thus:—\r\n\r\n_In snakes which are either viviparous, or in which from some cause or\r\nother extrusion has been so postponed that the young are conscious of\r\nexistence before birth._ Conscious also when born that they had been\r\nsafer in that pre-natal condition than now when assailed on all sides\r\nby dangers hitherto unknown. This idea—and probably an untenable,\r\nunphysiological, and foolish idea, which science might laugh to scorn\r\nin an instant—still the idea did flash into my mind one day in the\r\nsummer of 1873, when Holland, announcing a brood of young ring snakes\r\nwhich had just been hatched at the Gardens, and describing their baby\r\nterrors, said, ‘It is funny to see how they all try to wriggle back\r\ninto their shells again.’\r\n\r\n‘Then those little Colubers had been conscious of security before they\r\nwere hatched,’ I reflected, ‘and conscious when they did emerge into\r\nactivity that the shell had been a safe refuge to them.’ (This was\r\nprior to the American Convention, of which I knew nothing until long\r\nafterwards.)\r\n\r\nConsciousness of locality must, I think, have a good deal to do with\r\nthe maternal refuge; and that snakes possess this consciousness in a\r\nstrong degree has been already shown in their habit of returning to\r\nthe same spot to hibernate year after year: and not only for winter\r\nquarters; but a strong love of locality and a memory of home are\r\nobserved wherever snakes abound. ‘They remain in a hole or a crevice\r\nof the wall for years,’ Fayrer affirms. In his _Prairie Folk_,\r\nParker Gilmore tells of a family of ‘Puff adders’ (by which probably\r\n_Heterodon platyrhinos_ is meant) that had taken up their abode under\r\nthe boards of a porch for several years and could not be routed out.\r\nNicholson, also, in his _Indian Snakes_, informs us that when he was\r\nstationed at Kamptee in 1868, a cobra and a pair of _Bungarus acutus_\r\nlived in his bungalow for a long while. He could not find where\r\nthe cobra lived, but the Bungari made themselves at home in a hole\r\nof the wall under his dressing-table. He never saw either of these\r\ninterlopers, but identified them by the skins which they ‘periodically\r\ncast;’ taking advantage of his absence, no doubt, or of his nocturnal\r\nsomnolence, to perform their toilet under his looking-glass!\r\n\r\nThe often recounted tale of an Indian who had a tame rattlesnake\r\nthat went away every spring, and returned regularly each autumn to\r\na certain tub which it had appropriated for its home, is only an\r\nexample of affection for locality; but by those who were not cognisant\r\nof this habit, the story has been produced with a strong flavour\r\nof the marvellous, and the Indian who knew by the season when to\r\nexpect his creeping friend, was not slow to attribute the regular\r\nreturn to especial regard for his own person. That _crotalus_ coming\r\nalone so regularly, was probably a lone widow or widower; because\r\nwe also know that the _pair_ of snakes are usually seen together,\r\nand that they follow each other with strong conjugal affection. This\r\nis not irrelevant to the present subject; because the _affection_\r\nof ophidians, whether conjugal or maternal, is what we are now\r\nconsidering. The quality was well known in classic ages, though it\r\nhas been denied them in modern times. Many writers on snakes, while\r\naffirming that they ‘exhibit no phase of affection,’ describe their\r\nconstantly going in pairs; or the fact that they become ‘vicious if\r\ntheir retreat is cut off.’ ‘In their peregrinations male and female\r\nare always in company,’ says Catlin; ‘and when only one is seen, the\r\nother is sure to be within hearing.’ When a female has been killed and\r\nleft on the spot, the male always comes. The Indians profit by this\r\nknowledge of conjugal devotion to lie in wait and kill the mate. They\r\nplace the dead one near the hole of their retreat, and watch the egress\r\nof the survivor, which is sure to come and inspect its dead companion.\r\n\r\nSir Emerson Tennant observed a decided affection between the sexes of\r\nthe cobra. In his _History of Ceylon_ he gives several proofs, as for\r\ninstance a cobra being killed in a bath, and the next day the mate\r\nbeing found there. In Baird’s Report of one of the Pacific exploring\r\nexpeditions, a good deal is said about the Bull snake (_Pituophis_),\r\nwhich follows its mate by the scent. Once a fine individual having been\r\ncaptured and placed in a barrel near the tent, a large one of the same\r\nspecies was shortly afterwards found close by, and in a direct line\r\nfrom where its mate was caught.\r\n\r\nSo much for conjugal affection. As regards maternal devotion, we\r\ncertainly had a proof in the pythons remaining week after week on\r\ntheir eggs. True, they took no notice of the little ones when hatched,\r\nbecause they were well able to take care of themselves. The mothers\r\nhad fulfilled their duties beforehand. Snakes which are vicious at no\r\nother time, menace those who approach their nests or cut off their\r\nretreat. This is a fact universally recognised, alike in Africa, India,\r\nAustralia, and America: wherever a traveller, a hunter, or a resident\r\nincidentally mentions snake habits, he confirms this home affection.\r\n\r\n‘Snakes, if aggressive at no other time, are always spiteful when they\r\nhave young,’ says Fayrer. And an anecdote is related of a man who\r\nstumbled on a nest of young Hamadryads, and was pursued a long distance\r\nby the angry mother. Terror added wings to his flight, as she came\r\nfast upon him. In despair he plunged into a river and swam across,\r\nbut on reaching the opposite bank, up reared the furious Hamadryad,\r\nits dilated eyes glistening with rage, ready to bury its fangs in his\r\ntrembling body. Escape now seemed hopeless, and as a last resource he\r\ntore off his turban and threw that at the enemy. With characteristic\r\nstupidity the snake plunged its fangs into this, biting it furiously.\r\nAfter wreaking its vengeance upon the turban, it glided back to its\r\nnest and its young ones and so the man escaped.\r\n\r\n_Apropos_ of Indian snakes, Nicholson, though a practical ophiologist,\r\nnever heard of snakes swallowing their young in India. This may be\r\nbecause so large a proportion of them are egg-laying, and because the\r\nonly two vipers, _Daboia_ and _Echis_, are nocturnal, very shy, and\r\nnot so frequent. Most of the other members of the Indian _viperine_\r\nsnakes, the _Crotalidæ_, are tree snakes, which, like the sea snakes,\r\nare more likely to be dispersed and separated from their progeny,\r\nand to take refuge in flight. They are, besides, less frequent, shy,\r\nnocturnal, or crepuscular; and belong more to Malay and Hindoo China,\r\nthan to the localities in which observations are more feasible. Fayrer\r\ndoes not even state positively that they are viviparous. At the same\r\ntime Nicholson will ‘say nothing certain about the young going down\r\nthe throat, but sees no reason why not.’ ‘They can do without air for\r\nhalf an hour or so, and a snake’s throat is sufficiently capacious to\r\nallow a frog to croak _de profundis clamavi_ when he is two feet from\r\ndaylight.’\r\n\r\nAmong unprejudiced observers there are still some who are inclined\r\nto attribute to optical delusion the sudden disappearance of young\r\nsnakes; arguing from their astonishing rapidity of motion, and the\r\nalmost inappreciable space into which they can creep and hide in their\r\nmother’s coils. Mr. Arthur Nicols, in his interesting papers on Snakes,\r\npublished in _The Country_ newspaper, in 1878-79, describes a case of\r\nthis kind from personal observation when in Australia. He disturbed a\r\nsnake with a number of young around her, the latter quickly vanishing.\r\nHe discharged his gun, and the old snake was almost cut to pieces with\r\nshot. Approaching, he found all the young ones hidden beneath and about\r\nher, and when he stirred them up they persisted in hiding among the\r\nshattered coils, returning thither to the last.\r\n\r\nMr. Nicols states only that it was a poisonous snake, not giving the\r\nspecific name. She had probably incubated her eggs, and the young had\r\nremembered the shelter of their mother’s coils. That it was a display\r\nof filial refuge is, however, undeniable.\r\n\r\nA similar occurrence is related in the _Field_ of November 10th, 1866,\r\nby a Mr. Brittain, as an argument against the swallowing process.\r\nHe had seen young vipers run to their mother for protection, and so\r\ncompletely out of sight that only on disturbing them they were found to\r\nhave secreted themselves in her coils. These may have been at a more\r\nadvanced age, and had ceased to enter the mouth.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that hitherto, excepting in _Pelias berus_, we hear\r\nof this maternal display as peculiar to America only. Whether a more\r\nintimate acquaintance with the snakes of other countries will reveal\r\nnew instances in the course of time, we cannot conjecture. It is\r\nto be wished that observations on this head may be published, and\r\ninvestigations encouraged; or in the minds of the million, the maternal\r\nœsophagal refuge will still be classed among the fables.\r\n\r\nTaking it for granted, then, in deference to the American ‘Convention,’\r\nthat snakes do offer refuge to their young, it is curious to speculate\r\nas to how the habit originated and became a confirmed one. Maternal\r\ninstincts have, without doubt, been strong from the first; and we must\r\nsuppose that similar dangers to those which induce a snake now to\r\nsummon her young ones had also been the cause of postponed functions in\r\nthe mother, and that hers were precocious little reptiles before they\r\never saw light.\r\n\r\nBecause we cannot assume that in a state of _security_ an oviparous\r\nsnake would ‘retard its laying’ and become ovoviviparous or viviparous;\r\nnor that a viper would intentionally retain her young until their fangs\r\nwere developed (see p. 360), so that they should be able to take care\r\nof themselves; or a rattlesnake till its young had rattles as well as\r\nfangs (see p. 299), these being the principal species which do shelter\r\ntheir young. And the habit must have had a beginning; there must have\r\nbeen some training, some development of instinct, to lead up to what we\r\nnow see, viz. a snake deliberately giving a signal, lowering her head\r\nto the level of the ground or water, opening wide her mouth to receive\r\nher young, and giving them a second sign when they might safely venture\r\nforth again.\r\n\r\nThis is the state of things supposed to exist at the present time;\r\nand it would seem to be an organized habit, perfected in process of\r\nages, and one in which the mother’s instinct, and a _consciousness of\r\nharbouring active young ones before introducing them to surrounding\r\ndangers_, must have had a considerable share.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this speculative chapter, I can only humbly beg to\r\n‘second the motion’ put to the learned assembly at Portland, Maine,\r\nin 1873, to the effect that the subject will receive the attention of\r\nophiologists in all the snake countries of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n_SERPENT WORSHIP, ‘CHARMING,’ ETC._\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the preceding pages it has been my endeavour to resolve some of the\r\nsuperstitious myths into zoological facts, and to explain by the light\r\nof science those peculiar features and manners of the Ophidia which\r\nfrom the earliest traditions of the human race have been regarded as\r\nsupernatural.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the general organization of these reptiles, their\r\nmarvellous powers and habits, can we wonder at the impressions they\r\nhave created in untutored minds? Let us picture to ourselves our\r\nearliest ancestors with their dawning intellect contemplating the\r\ninstantaneous coil of a constrictor; or the almost invisible action\r\nin a flash of time with which the death-dealing stroke of the poison\r\nfang is effected. From a source which was incomprehensible, like the\r\nburning, scathing fluid from the skies, came a ‘sting,’ an agony,\r\ndeath! Awe-struck and filled with sacred terror were the beholders, as\r\nbefore them lay the paralyzed, tortured victim. Can we wonder that the\r\nslender, gliding ‘worm’ which inflicted this mortal injury should have\r\nbeen regarded as an evil spirit, a devil, and invested with maleficence?\r\n\r\nAdd to the two great death-dealing powers of the serpent\r\nrace—constriction and venom—those other peculiarities which have\r\nhere been faithfully recorded, the seeming renewal of life after the\r\nannual sleep, a mystery enhanced by the restored brilliancy and beauty\r\nof the reptile on its change of cuticle; let us picture to ourselves\r\nthose wondering savages now watching the limbless creature as it glides\r\ninto sight and is gone again, or as with fixed and glittering eyes it\r\nflickers that mysterious little tongue; let us imagine them crowding\r\nnear to behold a serpent feeding, or to witness the still more amazing\r\nspectacle of a brood of young ones vanishing down their mother’s\r\nthroat. There is enough of the mysterious in an ophidian to excite the\r\nawe and wonder of even a nineteenth-century beholder, taking each one\r\nof these surprising doings singly; but considering that any one serpent\r\nmay be endowed with nearly all of these phenomenal powers, let us\r\nimagine the effect produced by them in the savage mind. To worship such\r\nan incomprehensible creature was only consistent with all we know of\r\nthe influences which first awakened faith in a supernatural Being.\r\n\r\nConsequently we find that in every country where a serpent was known,\r\nit plays its part in the mythology and religion of that country. We may\r\nexamine the antiquities of any nation which has left a monument of its\r\nhistory and beliefs, and a serpent will be represented. Scarcely an\r\nEgyptian sculpture (in its entirety) can be found in which the serpent\r\ndoes not appear. The same may be said of the Hindoo monuments, their\r\ntemples, buildings, and sculptured caves; also of Mexican, Japanese,\r\nChinese, and other ancient mythologies.\r\n\r\nSingularly, too, no other object in nature—no birds or flowers\r\nor beautiful things—have been so universally adopted in personal\r\nornaments as the serpent idea. And in times of remote antiquity—as\r\nrelics prove—personal adornments, bracelets, coronets, and rings in\r\nthe form of serpents were as much in favour as at the present day. We\r\nmay, indeed, affirm that the modern bracelet is but a reproduction or\r\na restoration of those of antiquity, dating as far back as artificers\r\nin metals can be traced. Rough and rude representations of still\r\nearlier times are extant. And where the human race in its savage state\r\nhad no knowledge of art, the reptile itself, or such relics of it as\r\ncould be preserved, were adopted as personal decorations. Thus were\r\nthe American Indians found by the early colonists, with their belts of\r\nsnake skins, with the rattles of the Crotalus strung in their ears,\r\nand with necklaces and chains of snake bones and ‘rattels.’ Mackeney,\r\nCatlin, Schoolcraft, and other historians of the American Indians\r\nrelate numerous instances in proof of the universal veneration and\r\nsuperstition with which the serpent is regarded by those savages. If\r\nthey kill a rattlesnake, it is immediately skinned and distributed\r\nin small pieces among the tribe for their medicine bags, while the\r\ncaptor is pompously decorated with the skin. If on a journey they\r\nmeet a rattlesnake in their direct path, this is taken to be a sign\r\nthat they must go no farther. Some of the Indian traditions bear a\r\nremarkable resemblance to the prophetic symbols of the Hebrew faith.\r\n‘If thou bruise its head, it shall bruise thy heel.’ This in their eyes\r\nis regarded as ‘destiny,’ and they will on no account kill one that\r\nlies in their path, lest it should cause the death of the destroyer’s\r\nrelatives. The Indians are also supposed to possess the art of\r\nsnake-taming to an extraordinary degree. We are assured by more than\r\none writer that they also pet rattlesnakes, investing them with divine\r\nattributes, and sheltering them during the winter; though in this case\r\nthe ‘tameness’ may be partially due to the inertness resulting from the\r\nseason of the year. On returning spring they permit their _Penates_ to\r\nissue forth again.\r\n\r\nThe ancient temples of Mexico were richly embellished with carvings\r\nof serpents. One of them represents a serpent idol of not less than\r\nseventy feet long, in the act of swallowing a human being. Also, there\r\nis the ‘God of the Air,’ a feathered rattlesnake; and an edifice\r\nknown as the ‘Wall of Serpents,’ from the numerous reptilian forms\r\ncrowded upon it. But it is not necessary to enumerate antiquities,\r\nwith most of which the reader must be already acquainted, the object\r\nhere being rather to endeavour to account for those other attributes\r\nwhich have grown out of serpent worship, such as ‘fascinating,’ taming,\r\n‘charming,’ ‘dancing to music,’ etc.\r\n\r\nNot that serpent worship is extinct by any means. In India it is still\r\nso strong as to amount to a fatality; for the high annual death-rate\r\nfrom snake bites there is not half so much because the natives can’t\r\nbe cured, as because they _won’t_ be cured of what they regard as a\r\njust punishment from their deity. This we shall have occasion to show\r\nfurther on. That serpent superstitions are still rampant among the\r\nlow-caste Hindoos, is borne out by all modern writers on the native\r\nfaiths or customs. A. K. Forbes in his _Hindoo Annals_, or _Râs Mala_,\r\ntells us that cobras are looked upon as guardian angels. One cobra\r\n‘guarded’ a cave in which treasures were deposited; another cobra\r\n‘guarded’ a garden; and very good guards we should say they were, as\r\nfew persons would venture too near to such an ‘angel.’ One of the\r\nsupposed ‘Divinities’ is the _Poorwug Dev_, or spirit personified by\r\na snake, which is not allowed to be killed or injured; and if it bite\r\na person, that individual is supposed to be justly punished for some\r\nfault. Fatalism forbids any attempt to cure that unhappy victim, and he\r\nswells the annual death-rate. Due honours are paid to these ‘guardian\r\nangels’ found in most hamlets. Periodical festivals are held to them:\r\ntheir retreats are then garlanded with flowers, and, as already\r\nstated, eggs and milk are placed as propitiatory offerings. One of the\r\nBengalese traditions is, that a male infant auspiciously shaded by a\r\ncobra will come to the throne.\r\n\r\nAnd is the reptile which brings such distinction and honour into a\r\nfamily to be ruthlessly destroyed? ‘No Hindoo will willingly kill a\r\ncobra,’ Colonel Meadows Taylor tells us, in his _People of India_.\r\nShould one be killed accidentally within the precincts of a guarded\r\nvillage, a piece of copper money is put into its mouth, and the body is\r\nburned with offerings to avert the anticipated evil. The _najas_, or\r\nhooded snakes, from their habit of erecting themselves on the approach\r\nof persons, are those especially regarded as guardians. It was the same\r\nin Egypt. In the _najas_ are also supposed to dwell the spirits of\r\nhighly-favoured persons, or those whose lives had been of remarkable\r\npurity and goodness,—another motive for their being protected. It is\r\nstill the same in many parts of Africa, where the natives think ill\r\nluck follows the death of a python.\r\n\r\nIn works where medical statistics are given, such as Fayrer’s\r\n_Thanatophidia_, we learn the fatal results of these superstitions.\r\nWhen the natives find a cobra in their houses, as is not unfrequently\r\nthe case, says Fayrer, ‘they will conciliate it, feed and protect it,\r\nas though to injure it were to invoke misfortune on the house and\r\nfamily. Even should the death of some relative, bitten by accident,\r\noccur, the serpent is not killed, but caught and deferentially deported\r\nto the field or jungle, where it is set free.’ No one can peruse the\r\nabove without seeing how largely the percentage of deaths is traceable\r\nto native superstition. Fayrer also shows us the fatal consequences of\r\nthe confidence placed in the snake ‘charmers,’ who are considered to be\r\nespecially favoured by their deities, and endowed with curative powers.\r\nMuch interesting reading, apart from medical science, will be found in\r\nthe _Thanatophidia_ on the Hindoo faith in the _müntras_ or spells and\r\nincantations used by the charmers in cases of snake-bite. Out of some\r\nninety such cases selected by Fayrer from returns sent in by medical\r\nofficers in the Bengal Presidency, nearly half proved that either no\r\nremedies at all were tried, or that recourse was had to native nostrums\r\nor _müntras_. Briefly to enumerate a few of the reports: ‘Boy bitten\r\nby _keautiah_, charms and incantations; died in half an hour.’ ‘Man\r\nkeeping a krait (Bungarus) for “Poojah” (worship) was bitten, and\r\ndied in seven hours, notwithstanding native nostrums.’ A woman bitten\r\ndied in three hours ‘_in spite of incantations_’! ‘A man bitten while\r\nasleep had “_leaves to smell_,” but nevertheless died in three hours!’\r\n‘Woman bitten at night, got up and had _müntras_ (chantings) to expel\r\nthe poison. She died four hours after the bite notwithstanding; and\r\nher infant at the breast died two hours after partaking the maternal\r\nnutriment.’ And many similar cases. What wonder, then, with this\r\nmiserable fatalism prevailing over that vast and densely-populated\r\ncountry, that death by snake-bites should amount to many thousands\r\nannually? One more case must be recorded to show how deeply rooted the\r\nfaith. A tall, strong young man was bitten in the hand, while sleeping\r\nout of doors. No medicine was given, but _incantations_ were muttered\r\nover him. In an hour he was a corpse: yet the village where this\r\nhappened continues to do Poojah (adoration) to the cause of the evil.\r\nBy far the largest percentage of deaths is attributable to the cobra,\r\nthough this is not a proof that its numbers predominate so much above\r\nother snakes, as of the religious veneration in which it is everywhere\r\nheld. It is found all over the peninsula, even as high as 8000 feet on\r\nthe sunny slopes of the Himalayas. The names of castes, _Nâg_, _Nâgo_,\r\n_Nâgojee_, _Nâgowa_, etc., found among all classes of Hindoos, have\r\nall reference to the _Nâg_ or _Nâja_ deities, says Colonel Meadows\r\nTaylor. To this author, as well as to Forbes, Ferguson,[133] Fayrer,\r\nand Miss Frere,[134] the reader is referred in verification of the\r\nabove. If further to pursue the subject of snake worship, _The Serpent\r\nMyths of Ancient Egypt_, by W. R. Cooper, 1873; _The Serpent Symbol_,\r\nby Squires, 1851; _Sun and Serpent Worship_, by J. S. Phené; and\r\n_The Native Races of the Pacific States of North America_, by H. H.\r\nBancroft, are some of the many books that afford interesting matter.\r\nThese latter, however, allude more particularly to ancient nations.\r\nAmong many living and semi-barbarous tribes serpent superstitions\r\nexist, though, perhaps, more strongly in West Africa than elsewhere,\r\nexcepting India at the present time. In Africa, not the venomous so\r\nmuch as the large constricting snakes are the objects of care and\r\nveneration. In _Dahomey and the Dahomeans_, F. E. Forbes relates some\r\namusing instances of the sacred devotion of the Fetish women, or\r\nguardians and slaves of the python deities at Whydah. A Fetish house\r\nor temple devoted to the snakes was built round a large cotton-tree,\r\nand in this a number of pythons were permitted to roam about at their\r\npleasure. When they ventured beyond the precincts, their Fetish\r\nattendants went in search of them, and by gentle persuasions (probably\r\nin the form of poultry or other dietetic arguments) induced them to go\r\nhome: while all who met them bowed down and kissed the dust of their\r\npath. Morning and evening the devotees prostrated themselves before the\r\nsacred abode of these ophidian deities, either to worship the invisible\r\ngod _Seh_, or his representatives in serpentine form.\r\n\r\nFrom frequent and gentle handling, snakes thus protected naturally grow\r\ntame. The Fetish attendants become skilled in managing their reptile\r\ngods, and are not slow in investing themselves with especial powers for\r\ntheir office. And to this may the origin of the so-called ‘charmers’ be\r\ntraced; for ‘snake charming,’ like snake worship, dates back to the\r\nvery earliest ages. With a more intimate knowledge of the reptilian\r\nclass which modern zoology has brought about, comes happily a clearer\r\ninsight into the tricks of the snakemen, jugglers, and charmers of\r\nEgypt and the East. Snake-taming to-day is not confined to _Saadees_\r\nand _Samp Wallahs_; it is not even confined to non-venomous snakes,\r\nof which pythons have always proved very amenable pets. Mr. Mann’s\r\ntame pythons (see ‘Introduction’) were popular performers at the time\r\nthey were introduced in Chancery, and his pet constrictor, ‘Cleo,’ was\r\nhonoured with an obituary notice from the pen of Mr. Frank Buckland,\r\nin _Land and Water_, after she died ‘of grief,’ as was said, at the\r\nillness of her master.[135] The amiable ‘Cleo’ (or Cleopatra) was the\r\n‘constant companion’ of Mr. and Mrs. Mann for several years, and they\r\nsoon learned her wishes when she ‘asked’ for either food, drink, or\r\nfresh air. ‘A short time before her death she contracted a friendship\r\nfor a young kitten,’ was always ‘fond of children,’ who displayed no\r\nfear of that sociable ophidian. But she was shy of strangers; and this\r\nI myself realized on paying my respects to her; for not until she was\r\nfully convinced that I had no evil intentions, and not without much\r\ncoaxing and persuasion on the part of her guardians, could Cleo be\r\ninduced to approach me.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the constricting snakes at the Zoological Gardens of even\r\nlarger size than Cleo are exceedingly tame, permitting themselves\r\nto be handled. One of them, a temporary inmate during the winter of\r\n1881-82, was introduced to the public by Dr. Stradling through the\r\ncolumns of _Land and Water_, April 3, 1880, as ‘Totsey,’ together\r\nwith her brother ‘Snap,’ the latter named ‘from a trifling infirmity\r\nof temper when young.’ These two were the offspring of the Panama boa\r\nwho gave birth to 20 live young at the Gardens, June 30, 1877. Of\r\nthese twenty, Mr. Sclater notified, at one of the Zoological Society’s\r\nmeetings in the following November, that all but one were still alive.\r\nOf the two which became the property of Dr. Stradling and were tamed\r\nby him, he wrote, ‘Any one can handle them with impunity;’ and that\r\nthey recognised him among others in the dark, permitting him only to\r\ntouch them at such a time. ‘Lolo’ and ‘Menina’ are the pretty names of\r\ntwo other tame constrictors belonging to this ophiophilist, and whose\r\namiable and interesting manners were recorded in the above journal. Of\r\n‘Totsey’ the Dr. writes, ‘She is the most gentle and affectionate snake\r\nI ever had.’ As this same Miss Ophidia happened to be an inmate at the\r\nGardens in January 1882, when the pair of illustrations (p. 205) were\r\nin preparation, she adorns that page; though in truth it was one of her\r\nbrothers or sisters, then rather smaller, that really did hang thus on\r\nthe branch as I sketched it at the time, September 24, 1880.\r\n\r\nThat some of the most venomous serpents are also capable of being\r\ntamed we have many proofs. They use their fangs in self-defence,\r\nactuated by fear or hunger; and where no fear exists, a serpent\r\nwould not deliberately crawl about, expending its precious and only\r\nprotective power, _venom_, on any object it met with. Would a cobra or\r\na crotalus in its native woods approach any living thing it saw and\r\nindiscriminately strike it with its poison fangs? No. Its primary\r\nimpulse would be to escape. It strikes only under provocation or\r\nhunger. Therefore if a venomous snake in captivity become so familiar\r\nwith your presence as to cease to fear you, it would also abstain\r\nfrom biting you. Not that one would recommend Jararacas or cobras for\r\npets, notwithstanding the assurance of some residents in India that\r\nthe latter are capital guards to a dwelling, and in some are even\r\nencouraged instead of dogs, as the less liable to bite of the two! Miss\r\nFrere, in her interesting reminiscences of India, _Old Deccan Days_,\r\ngives instances of children playing with the cobra without injury.\r\nShe mentions a Brahman boy who could without any other music than his\r\nown voice attract and handle with impunity any venomous serpents that\r\nmight be within hearing. They would come out of a thicket or a dry\r\nstone wall—their favourite refuge. Such instances are sufficiently\r\nrare to be regarded as miraculous, adds the authoress, still they do\r\noccur. ‘How much is due to gentleness of touch and fearlessness, how\r\nmuch to any personal peculiarity which pleases the senses of the snake,\r\nit is difficult to say.’ The boy above alluded to was believed to be\r\nthe incarnation of some divinity, and the magistrate took note of his\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nBut at last, through some inadvertency, he got bitten; when he\r\ndied, notwithstanding the divinity he was supposed to enshrine,\r\nnotwithstanding the spells and _müntras_ which might be pronounced over\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe cobra is supposed to have originally had seven heads, as we see\r\nrepresented on Hindoo temples. The ‘hood’ is believed to be the remains\r\nof these seven heads; and the _Gokurrah_, whose pattern of the double\r\nocellus had gained it the name of the ‘spectacled cobra,’ is held\r\nin the highest esteem of all from the two spots being considered the\r\nfootprints of the god _Krishna_. These are the especial favourites of\r\nthe professional snake charmers.\r\n\r\nWhen it is borne in mind that snakes have been tamed by persons of\r\nonly slight experience, we can easily comprehend that with a life’s\r\npractice, and with inherited facilities, the Oriental jugglers must\r\nacquire peculiar expertness in dealing with their ‘charmed’ specimens.\r\nOriginally, no doubt, the office of the professed snake tamer was\r\nconnected with the sacred rites of serpent-worshipping communities, but\r\nhas now greatly degenerated into the trade of jugglers and tricksters.\r\nThat some of these do acquire extraordinary skill in dealing with their\r\ndangerous captives cannot be denied. Profound faith is placed in their\r\nperformances by the natives, who attribute to them supernatural agency.\r\nFrom being close observers of reptile character, they know how far to\r\nventure on familiarities. They thoroughly understand the movements\r\nof the sluggish and timid serpents with which they are toying; and\r\nwhile keeping up a perpetual gabble to divert the attention of the\r\nspectators, aggravated by the tum-tumming and so-called ‘music’ to\r\nwhich the snakes are supposed to ‘dance,’ they themselves keep just\r\nbeyond striking reach, and provoke the snake to follow the waving\r\nmotion of their hands. The true object or impulse of the snake is to\r\nbite the irritating cause, the pretended motive is ‘dancing.’ To follow\r\nthe movement of the object which provokes them is instinctive, music\r\nor not; and without any din and cackle and jargon, the cobras would do\r\nthis all the same. Long practice and an intimate acquaintance have\r\ngiven the jugglers confidence and dexterity, while on the part of the\r\nsnake fear is the chief characteristic. Even the tamest cobra is only\r\nwatching the opportunity to escape, and the moment the juggler ceases\r\nhis performance, down it drops, and makes for its basket. Should\r\nthe performance not be ended, the snakes are called to attention by\r\nbeing sharply pulled back by their tail, when up they rise with hood\r\nexpanded, and with just enough of power and spirit left in them to\r\nrecommence the ‘dance,’ more truly to make one more futile attempt to\r\nstrike their tyrannical masters. It is only a repetition of the same\r\nkind of ‘obedience’ and ‘intelligence’ that was accredited to that\r\nfirst rattlesnake ever exhibited in England.\r\n\r\nThat showman (introduced p. 285) had become well acquainted with\r\ncrotalus idiosyncracies, and knew how to turn them to account before an\r\nignorant crowd.\r\n\r\nThose who have to deal with venomous serpents tell us, that with\r\ncaution and expertness they are not difficult to handle; and this\r\nis verified by all who describe the performances of Oriental\r\nsnake-charmers. Not only cobras with fangs extracted, or mouths sewn\r\nup, or composition ‘cerastes’ with artificial horns fastened on to the\r\nheads of harmless snakes, but those with perfect fangs and well-filled\r\npoison glands, are handled with equal facility. By pressing down the\r\nsnake’s head gently with a stick and then seizing it firmly close\r\nbehind the head, so close that it has no power to turn it, you fetter\r\nits movements. Or to snatch up a venomous snake by its tail and quickly\r\nsupport it festooned on a stick which you draw gently towards the\r\nhead, and then secure that as above, is another method adopted; or,\r\nagain, to seize the tail and pass the hand swiftly along the body\r\ntill the head is reached, and _then_ grasp the neck. These are among\r\nthe various ways of handling poisonous serpents, according to the\r\npurposes required of them. Every movement must be carefully watched,\r\nhowever, and the head not released until the entire snake is free to be\r\nreturned straight into its cage. Even wild and vicious cobras are thus\r\nfearlessly dealt with by experts; and those which are in process of\r\ntaming are put through a daily training. They are made comfortable in a\r\nbasket, conciliated with food and milk, soothed by softly stroking them\r\nwith a brush and by kind and gentle handling.\r\n\r\nI once stood by and looked on while the keeper unpacked a box of\r\ncobras. He took each one out by its tail, and dropped it into another\r\nbox with such expedition that the fearful reptile had not time to turn\r\nand bite him. Not that he ventured to lower his hand into the midst\r\nof the writhing angry tangle of snakes, but first, at a respectful\r\ndistance (the writer still more deferentially contemplating the\r\ntransfer from afar), he, with a long-handled hook, contrived to draw\r\nout a snake tail first, and getting the tip over the edge of the box,\r\nthis he seized, thus, one after the other, shifting eight of the dozen\r\ncobras. Both boxes had lids, of course—glass slides, which were\r\ncautiously but quickly drawn aside, and as sharply closed again.[136]\r\nThese deadly reptiles, after being some weeks, perhaps months, in\r\na small close box, were not, as may be supposed, in a very lively\r\ncondition, but sufficiently so to erect themselves and hiss like a\r\nflock of geese, striking at the lid and the glass, and doing their\r\nbest to alarm the manipulator, and also to suspend the breath of my\r\nawe-struck self. Calmly and safely, however, Holland concluded his task.\r\n\r\nBy pressing down the head with a stick, or seizing it quickly by the\r\ntail, American Indians similarly manage the rattlesnakes. Not they\r\nalone, however, are skilled in taming these deadly reptiles. Here, at\r\nhome in England, domesticated _Crotali_ are not unknown. Dr. Stradling\r\nthinks they may be rendered as harmless as non-venomous kinds, by a\r\ngradual training; and has succeeded in so far taming one that he felt\r\nsafe in offering it as a gift to even an unskilled non-charmer. ‘I have\r\na very _nice_ tame rattlesnake between four and five feet long, in good\r\ncondition and feeding well, which I shall be delighted to send you,’\r\nhe wrote me, August 1881. ‘It has got so tame that you might handle it\r\nwithout fear at any time you wished to investigate any part of it.’ It\r\nis perhaps superfluous to add that this amiable and exemplary reptile\r\nwas gratefully declined.\r\n\r\nThe reader’s devoted servant had not undergone a course of\r\nprophylactics as the Doctor had. He is both an expert and to a certain\r\nextent venom-proof at the same time; but for all that the snake was, as\r\nhe affirmed, tame enough to be handled with impunity by those who might\r\nhave sufficient courage to venture. That interesting and accommodating\r\nrattlesnake is no more, but was even more honoured in death than in\r\nlife. A true martyr to science, it was sacrificed that its friend and\r\nteacher might prosecute his experiments, and also swallow some of\r\nthe contents of its poison gland, in order to convince two or three\r\nchallenging sceptics that he could do this with impunity.[137]\r\n\r\nAs in all other trades, there are various grades among the Oriental\r\nsnake-tamers. The legitimate ‘charmer’ of India—the _Samp\r\nWallah_—prides himself on being a descendant of the prophet, and the\r\nsecret of his art is cherished as an heirloom in his family. This\r\nalso is the case in Arabia and Egypt, where the astonishing feats\r\nwhich, without any doubt, are performed by professional ‘snake men,’\r\nare attributed to special and secret powers, jealously guarded from\r\nage to age. It may be possible that, like the Psylli of old, they may\r\nhave recourse to some drug which renders their person repugnant to the\r\nserpent, and thus provides immunity from a bite. Not yet altogether\r\ndiscarded, either, is the ancient belief that in the body of the\r\nviper itself is found a specific for its poison. Since the days of\r\nÆsculapius, decoctions of vipers and recipes enough to form an Ophidian\r\ncookery-book and pharmacopeia combined, have found favour not only\r\namong the ‘faculty’ of classic days, but among all our ancestral dames.\r\nWe are told that vipers abound in volatile salts that are cures for\r\nmany ills. Certain it is that ‘viper wine,’ viper broth, viperine\r\nsalts, the powder of dried vipers, preparations from the dejecta,\r\nthe oil, and even the slough have all enjoyed a high reputation,\r\nand I believe are—_some_ of these at any rate—still in vogue in\r\nsecluded districts where the refinements of medical science have not\r\nyet replaced them. It is remarkable, too, that for skin affections\r\ntheir virtues chiefly commend themselves. The ancient belief that to\r\ndevour vipers proved a specific for their bite, has to the present\r\nday prevailed among the snake-charmers of Egypt, who—whether or not\r\nfrom this practice—are said so to assimilate their bodies that the\r\nvenom does not harm them. The Bushmen of South Africa, it is asserted,\r\nswallow poison to render themselves proof against its effects; and\r\nhistory records many other tribes who have had such confidence in their\r\nown and an inherited immunity, that they hesitated not in exposing\r\ntheir infants to deadly serpents. The Persian word _Bezoar_, a popular\r\ndrug, means counter-poison; in allusion to the immunity from poison\r\nwhich persons who feed on venomous snakes are believed to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThough much discredit has been thrown on these so-called ‘immunities,’\r\nand though it is so very difficult to know what to believe where a\r\nserpent is concerned, the possibility does appear to be borne out by\r\nsome authentic writers of our own time. The late John Keast Lord, when\r\nin Egypt, had frequent opportunities of observing the tricks of the\r\njugglers; and not only he, but, as he assures us, many intelligent and\r\neducated Europeans, fully believed that some secret power was practised\r\nby the ‘high-caste’ charmers, who really did exhibit astonishing feats\r\nwith their snakes. Of these, the habit of devouring the reptiles alive\r\ncan here admit only of bare allusion.[138]\r\n\r\nIn _Dahomey and the Dahomeans_, F. E. Forbes tells of the natives\r\nwalking fearlessly bare legged in the grass where snakes abound, and\r\nthat on one occasion on alluding to the danger, a boy said to him: ‘No\r\nfear; if my father is bitten, he knows of an herb that will cure him.’\r\n\r\nAnother recent authority whom we are bound to respect is Schliemann. In\r\nhis work _Troy and its Remains_, published in 1875, he writes (p. 117):\r\n‘We still find poisonous snakes among the stones as far down as from\r\nthirty-three to thirty-six feet, and I have hitherto been astonished\r\nto see my workmen take hold of the reptiles with their hands and play\r\nwith them: nay, yesterday I saw one of the men bitten twice by a viper,\r\nwithout seeming to trouble himself about it. When I expressed my\r\nhorror, he laughed, and said that he and all his comrades knew there\r\nwere a great many snakes in this hill, and they had therefore all\r\ndrunk a decoction of the snake-weed, which grows in the district, and\r\nwhich renders the bite harmless. Of course I ordered a decoction to be\r\nbrought to me, so that I also may be safe from these bites. I should,\r\nhowever, like to know whether this decoction would be a safeguard\r\nagainst the fatal effects of the bite of the hooded cobra, of which\r\nin India I have seen a man die within half an hour. If it were so, it\r\nwould be a good speculation to cultivate snake-weed in India.’\r\n\r\nA correspondent in _Land and Water_, signed ‘R. C.,’ quoting\r\nSchliemann, inquired the name of this snake-weed, but without eliciting\r\ninformation. Most of the countries in which snakes abound would seem to\r\nrejoice in ‘snake-weeds’ and ‘snake-roots.’ ‘It has pleased nature that\r\nthere should be nothing without its antidote,’ said Pliny; and though\r\n‘the faculty’ tell us that no antidote for snake venom has as yet been\r\ndiscovered, it nevertheless appears to be certain that the Arabs, the\r\nNubians, Egyptians, and other nations seek to procure immunity from\r\nsnake-bite by the use of certain plants, of which the _Aristolochias_\r\nseem to be most frequent. The juice or a decoction is drunk, the root\r\nchewed, and an infusion used for washing the skin. The South American\r\nIndians are said to be able thus to protect themselves; and we have\r\nthe high authority of Humboldt in support of the theory that the\r\nfamous _huaco_, and other poisonous plants with which they inoculate\r\nthemselves, may impart an odour to their bodies which is repugnant to\r\nthe snakes.\r\n\r\nIt would be well to obtain definite information as to what the\r\n‘snake-weed’ of Schliemann was, _botanically_. It is also important to\r\nascertain the species of ‘viper’ that is there so abundant; then there\r\nwould be a basis for investigation. The testimony of a traveller like\r\nSchliemann is not to be disregarded. Besides him, Livingstone, P. H.\r\nGosse, and others have affirmed the same thing, viz. the existence of\r\nantidotal plants, but which, in the hands of science, seem never to\r\ndisclose their virtues!\r\n\r\nAs a part of the present subject comes a serpent’s supposed love of\r\n‘music,’ and on this head again the evidence is contradictory. Setting\r\naside the idea of ‘music,’ in the way of melody or harmony, we may\r\nbe able to arrive at a clue to the undeniable fact that snakes do\r\nexhibit some consciousness of _noise_. ‘Music,’ properly so called,\r\nis certainly very far removed from the gourd-rapping and tum-tumming\r\nof the Oriental jugglers; yet the snakes display a consciousness of\r\nthese uncouth sounds. Mr. Mann affirmed that Cleo and his other pet\r\nboas manifested undoubted feeling—let us call it consciousness—when\r\nthe piano was being played. Dr. Arthur Stradling, on the contrary,\r\ntells us that his own snakes ‘are almost always within hearing of a\r\npiano, and never show the slightest emotion at the sound.’[139] His\r\nobservations, I believe, refer chiefly to his life at sea, where his\r\ncabin did duty as concert-room, menagerie, and all else combined, and\r\nwhere, apart from piano, there would be ceaseless noise and jarring;\r\nor even if on shore, the ‘always’ would rather support my own theory\r\nor speculation as to any feasible solution of the fact that serpents\r\nare affected by _noise_, not ‘music.’ And my idea is, that it is the\r\njarring or vibration _through solids_, and not the mere sound, that\r\nthus affects the snakes. Since first venturing to express this idea\r\nin the _Dublin University Magazine_, Jan. 1876, I have continued to\r\nobserve the effect on snakes of what we may call _disturbing noises_.\r\nAt the Gardens, where they become accustomed to noises of all kinds,\r\nit is less easy to arouse them; but when the place is unusually quiet,\r\nthe experiment may be tried. The ‘snake men’ of the East, whose trade\r\nis to hunt out snakes by means of sound, effect this by _rapping_ on\r\nthe wall or ceiling, or by making loud, clucking noises with their\r\ntongue as much as by their so-called ‘music;’ and Pliny,—if we may\r\ncite Pliny to suit our purpose and discard him otherwise,—or whoever\r\n_he_ quotes, affirms that snakes are more easily aroused by the _sound_\r\nof footsteps than by the sight of the approaching person. A custom is\r\nprevalent in Ceylon, we are told, of using a jingling stick in the dark\r\nto strike the ground in order to frighten snakes out of the path. The\r\njingling ‘music’ here is disturbing, not alluring, but as regards the\r\nknocking it proves sensitiveness to vibration conveyed by the ground.\r\nThe American Indians are _experts_ in the way of ascertaining sounds\r\nas conveyed by the ground. They throw themselves prone upon the earth,\r\npressing their ear close to it, and are able to decide with great\r\naccuracy the direction, the distance, and the nature of a far-off\r\nsound. May we not conclude, then, that the perception of sound to a\r\nserpent is through solids, a feeling more than a hearing of noises?\r\nThe creature, always prone to the ground or other solids, and with an\r\ninternal aural apparatus, must be peculiarly sensitive to vibrations\r\nthus conveyed.\r\n\r\n‘Lizzie,’ the heroine of chap. xxvi., was proved to be sensitive to\r\ndisturbing noises, and her ophidian relatives are probably similarly\r\naffected. As to _tune_, any sharp sound will answer; and as to time, it\r\nis not the ‘music,’ but, as we have already hinted, the waving hand or\r\nknee, or bright colours used by the _charmers_, to which the movements\r\nof the serpents respond. This also is a subject quite worth scientific\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nA word in conclusion about the ‘fascination of the serpent’s eye,’ a\r\nfable of so remote a date that it is as hard as any to eradicate. Even\r\nscientific observers admit that there is a _something_ that attracts\r\nthe eyes of birds or small mammals such as squirrels, timid creatures\r\nwhich often stare fixedly at ourselves as much as at a snake. Dr. A.\r\nSmith says: ‘Whatever may be said in ridicule of fascination, it is\r\nnevertheless true that birds and even quadrupeds are, under certain\r\ncircumstances, unable to retire from the presence of their enemies, and\r\nwhat is even more extraordinary, unable to resist the propensity to\r\nadvance from a situation of actual safety into one of danger.[140] He\r\nhas seen birds collect round the African tree snakes, particularly the\r\nBoomslange (described p. 407), and fly to and fro, shrieking, until\r\none of them almost touches its lips.’ Exactly so. We are not _told_ as\r\nmuch, but every one who knows anything of snake life will feel quite\r\nsure that those tree snakes were making good use of their delicate\r\ntongues in order to ascertain all they could about those enticing\r\nshriekers; and that the birds were equally desirous of knowing what\r\ndainty in the shape of worm or flitting creature that tongue might be.\r\nIn the case of the rattlesnake the ‘fascinated’ birds are probably\r\nenticed by the insect they think they _hear_, as well as that they\r\nthink they _see_, in the supposed worm wriggling so temptingly and\r\nvanishing so strangely. The snake remains rigidly still the while, the\r\nonly moving thing being that investigating tongue.\r\n\r\nMy observations at the Zoological Gardens first led me to this\r\nconclusion. On the feeding days several years ago, when watching to\r\ndetect the ‘fascination’ one had been led to expect, I noticed that\r\nthe birds—even the sparrows and finches—were attracted by the tongue\r\nof the snake, and would stop when hopping about the cage and look\r\nintently and curiously on the vibrating tongue. Some would venture on a\r\ncloser inspection, and remain gazing, or would even peck at it, until a\r\nmovement of the snake told them that the motionless object from which\r\nthat wriggling thing protruded was a living animal. Then they might hop\r\naway indifferently, happily unconscious that what they had perched on\r\nas a branch or a log was animated with a hungering after themselves.\r\n\r\nAny further ‘spell,’ or ‘fascination,’ or attraction might be\r\nattributed to a soporific or paralytic rather than a pleasurable\r\ninfluence; and arising from the noxious breath of a venomous serpent,\r\nor the fixity of its eyes, never blinking. Horses, dogs, and other\r\nanimals have an intuitive perception of the vicinity of a snake, and\r\nrefuse to advance; is it therefore reasonable to conclude that the\r\nlesser animals are not similarly affected? It is serpent nature to\r\nwait motionless for its prey. Any creature coming unexpectedly upon\r\nthat rigid object, with its fixed, glittering eyes, would, actuated\r\nby mingled alarm and curiosity, stop to make itself acquainted with\r\nthe extraordinary sight, the only life or motion in which would be\r\nthe tongue suddenly and silently appearing and disappearing. A bird\r\nmight be beguiled within striking distance, or might stop spell-bound.\r\nWe ourselves are sometimes impelled to approach an unaccountable yet\r\nterrifying object. Fear has also a paralyzing effect, and we remain\r\nmotionless, breathless, with eyes as fixed as a serpent’s.\r\n\r\nObservation of nature and an inquiry into causes will often present\r\nvery commonplace reasons for what appears to savour of the marvellous.\r\nA snake has just made a meal of some fledgelings. The mother bird has\r\nwitnessed her offspring vanishing by degrees, and she frantically\r\nhovers over the reptile, fluttering to and fro, and probably uttering\r\ncries of distress or of enticement, in the hope of her young ones’\r\nreturn. Birds have been observed thus endeavouring to rescue a\r\nhalf-swallowed fledgeling. The naturalist at once comprehends the\r\nreason; the poet thinks the birds are ‘fascinated.’\r\n\r\nI am not aware that any other ophiologist than Dr. Stradling, in\r\ndiscussing the ‘fascination’ idea, has attributed to the tongue of a\r\nsnake an allurement in the shape of a prospective meal. In one of his\r\npapers to _Land and Water_ (April 2, 1881) he described a hen that had\r\nbeen put into the cage for his anaconda’s dinner, making ‘a determined\r\ndab at the snake’s tongue, sometimes two or three dabs in quick\r\nsuccession,’ every time the quivering black line caught her eye. ‘Now\r\nwhy does she do that?’ he asks. ‘Certainly from no animosity towards\r\nthe snake, in whose presence she has not the slightest consciousness\r\nof danger, as she was otherwise engaged in pecking up the maize that\r\nwas in the cage. My own idea is that she mistakes the tongue for a\r\nwriggling worm,’ adds the observer in almost the very words I had used\r\nmore than six years previously,[141] long before we had exchanged a\r\nword on the subject or were even acquainted. He further described in\r\nthe same issue of _Land and Water_, and also in the _Field_ (June 3,\r\n1882), how a scarlet _tanager_ in Costa Rica had been attracted out\r\nof a tree down close to a snake by its quivering tongue, the only\r\nmoving thing about it. Dr. Stradling had seen a frog similarly snapping\r\nat the tongue of a snake, and thinks that one of the chief uses of\r\nthe mysterious little organ is to attract insectivorous animals. My\r\nown observations prove the tongue to be a _successful_ lure, which\r\nmay go a good way towards explaining ‘fascination;’ but whether an\r\n_intentional_ lure, any more than an intentional intimidation, as\r\ndiscussed in chap. v., I hesitate to affirm.\r\n\r\n‘Fascination,’ then, may be sometimes imputed to curiosity, sometimes\r\nto an anticipated morsel. It may partake of fear, or it may be an\r\ninvoluntary approach; it may be the struggles of a poisoned creature\r\nunable to get away, or the maternal anxieties of a bird or small mammal\r\nwhose offspring has fallen a victim to the snake. Divesting it of\r\nall poetry or magic, it will admit of several matter-of-fact, albeit\r\nsometimes tragic explanations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n_THE VENOMS AND THEIR REMEDIES._\r\n\r\n\r\nON a subject which has baffled research in all ages, viz. the endeavour\r\nto discover an antidote for snake venom, it scarcely becomes me to\r\nspeak. Yet, as in the foregoing chapters, I may at least venture to lay\r\nbefore my readers some general account of the various remedies used in\r\nsnake regions, and, for the benefit of residents in those countries,\r\ndescribe the most approved means of treating the bites of venomous\r\nserpents. Information of this kind will not, I trust, be wholly useless.\r\n\r\nFirst, it may be as well to impressively repeat what has been already\r\nconstantly affirmed by all our scientific experimentalists on snake\r\nvenoms, that ‘as yet _no antidote to them has been found_.’ Remedies\r\nthere are in abundance; and it is just as great an error to believe\r\nthat all snake venom is incurable—_i.e._ that a bitten person must\r\nnecessarily die—as that there are countless ‘antidotes,’ as persons\r\nbroadly and loosely call the various means of cure.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Professor Halford’s treatment by subcutaneous\r\ninjections of ammonia were so popularly discussed, you might read week\r\nafter week of ‘Halford’s newly-discovered antidote for snake-bites.’\r\nProfessor Halford, so far from claiming the discovery of an ‘antidote,’\r\nemphatically explained that ammonia thus used was ‘only a mode of\r\ntreatment.’ ‘It must never be forgotten,’ he said, ‘that ammonia cannot\r\n_destroy_ the venom;’ by which we comprehend what the scientific mean\r\nby an ‘antidote,’ something that effectually _destroys, neutralizes,\r\nand annihilates_ the poison. Sir Joseph Fayrer, after long and\r\nelaborate experiments with the Indian thanatophidia, prescribes various\r\nremedies and modes of treatment, ‘but do not confuse these with\r\n_antidotes_!’ he urges.[142] ‘To conceive of an _antidote_ to snake\r\npoison in the true sense of the term,’ he explains, ‘one must imagine\r\na substance so subtle as to follow, overtake, and neutralize the\r\nvenom in the blood, or that shall have the power of counteracting and\r\nneutralizing the deadly influence it has exerted on the vital forces.\r\nSuch a substance has still to be found, and our present experience of\r\nthe action of drugs does not lead to hopeful anticipation that we shall\r\nfind it.’\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these confident assertions, we are continually\r\nreading of ‘an infallible cure for snake-bite, never known to fail;’\r\n‘another antidote to snake-bite;’ or that ‘at length an antidote\r\nhas been discovered,’ which on investigation may be something tried\r\nlong ago, and occasionally with success, or it may be a plant or a\r\nchemical preparation which under certain circumstances effects a cure,\r\nbut none of which will stand the above definition of _antidote_.\r\nEach new attempt is announced as ‘an antidote’ nevertheless. Dr.\r\nArthur Stradling was severely hauled over the coals for ‘boasting\r\nof an antidote,’ when it accidentally transpired that he had been\r\nexperimenting on himself ‘with a view to discovering, _not an\r\nantidote_, but a prophylactic against the venom,’ to use his own\r\nwords.[143]\r\n\r\nMore recently still permanganate of potash has been announced as\r\nan antidote; and no doubt in some cases it has proved a successful\r\n_remedy_, as occasionally, but not invariably, other treatments have\r\nbeen. There still, however, appears to be the same lack of substantial\r\nevidence with regard to its being an ‘infallible antidote’ in the\r\nchemical acceptation of the term; and indeed as venoms themselves\r\nvary, a remedy that might prove effectual in one case might fail in\r\nanother. Dr. Stradling, than whom perhaps few are more competent\r\nto offer opinions on the subject (he having for five or six years\r\nsubjected himself to experiments and carefully noted the effects on\r\nhis own person, as others have noted the effects on animals and birds\r\nbitten), says that you might as well hunt through the pharmacopeia for\r\na drug that will be a specific in every kind of fever, or ‘to look for\r\na general antidote to opium, strychnine, bella donna, arsenic, and\r\nmercury poisoning,’ as to expect to find one antidote for every kind of\r\nsnake venom. ‘When we know how many different venoms there are, we may\r\nlook for an antidote to each,’ he has explained.\r\n\r\nYears ago the venoms were classed under the heads of _Viperine_,\r\n_Echidnine_, _Crotaline_, etc.; but Dr. Stradling states that he has\r\nfound very different venoms in _Crotalus horridus_ and _Crotalus\r\ndurissus_, and that he prepared himself differently for each species\r\nof snake with which he experimented, having in five different species\r\nfound five distinct and separate venoms. The bite of one snake more\r\nrapidly affects the blood, that of another the nerves; while the local\r\nand the constitutional symptoms also vary; but ‘all are attended\r\nmore or less with rigors, delirium, syncope, convulsions, paralysis,\r\nand coma.’ Many of the so-called cures have not been cures at all,\r\nbecause, as was afterwards found, the snakes that inflicted the bites\r\nwere not venomous. This we can understand from the indiscriminate use\r\nof such vernaculars as ‘adder,’ ‘jararaca,’ ‘cobra,’ as explained\r\nin previous chapters. Or, if undoubtedly a bite has been given by\r\nan undoubtedly venomous kind, it does not follow that a full charge\r\nof venom accompanied the bite. The glands may have been previously\r\nexhausted, the snake may have been feeble, or it might not have\r\nexpended its poison. For among other marvels we are led to believe that\r\nvipers, perhaps also the _elapidæ_, have a control over their store\r\nof venom, and do not involuntarily expend it, that is, when _forced_\r\nto bite. ‘Great doubt exists as to the efficacy of forced bites,’\r\nsays Nicholson. Dr. Weir Mitchel came to the same conclusion in his\r\nrattlesnake experiments, viz. that a snake ‘is able voluntarily to\r\ncontrol the shedding of its poison when inflicting a wound or grasping\r\nan object with its jaws.’ This accounts for many bites not having\r\nproved fatal, and for reputed antidotes having effected ‘cures.’ Nor,\r\nwhen we come to think of it, does this control of the venom appear\r\nso extraordinary after all. The poison gland is a modification of\r\nordinary salivary glands; and, if we may have recourse to a not very\r\nelegant comparison, a person or an animal can simulate the _action_ of\r\nbiting or of spitting without ejecting saliva. Again, as Dr. Stradling\r\nexpresses it, ‘snake virus is a natural secretion provided for the\r\ndistinct physiological purpose of enabling the reptile to secure its\r\nprey.’[144] Fayrer also explains that some snakes, naturally sluggish,\r\n‘bite reluctantly;’ but, if irritated and made angry, then ‘with great\r\nforce and determination.’ In the one instance a bitten person might\r\nrecover, in the second case die, because here the snake ‘thoroughly\r\nimbedded its fangs’ (p. 379).\r\n\r\nIt is often asked, ‘Which is the most poisonous snake?’—a question\r\nas difficult to answer as, ‘Which is the most poisonous plant?’ Dr.\r\nGünther’s opinion is that the degree of danger depends less on the\r\n_species_ which inflicts the wound, than on the bulk of the snake, the\r\nquantity of its venom, the season or temperature, and the place of the\r\nwound. Quantity for quantity, the virus of one snake is more active or\r\nmore powerful than another, and different in its effects; but then the\r\nlesser discharge of poison directly into a vein might be more serious\r\nthan a full discharge in a part where absorption is slow. Also exactly\r\nthe same quantity, minim for minim, would more seriously affect a\r\nwarm than a cold blooded animal, more seriously affect a feeble and\r\ntimid person or animal than the brave and vigorous. Yet, as there is\r\na notable gradation in the development of the poison apparatus, the\r\nperfection of which culminates in the viper, it seems not unreasonable\r\nto decide that as a rule a viper is more virulent than an elaps of the\r\nsame size—let us say _bulk_, because the viperine snakes are short and\r\nthick and the _elapidæ_ long and slight. Each snake is supplied with\r\nvenom adequate to its own requirements, that is, enough to kill the\r\nprey on which it subsists, a large viper with a larger supply for a\r\nlarger animal; and a small elaps with enough to kill its little bird\r\nor mouse. There may be exceptions; as, for instance, in the _Callophis\r\nintestinalis_, whose glands are abnormally developed, though it is not\r\na large snake; still accidents or experiments rather go to prove that\r\na viper is more noxious than an elaps under similar conditions. Fayrer\r\nproved the virulence of _Echis carinata_, the little Indian 18-inch\r\nviper’s poison, by diluting a quarter of a drop of its venom in ten\r\ndrops of water and injecting it into the leg of a fowl, which died in\r\nten minutes; while the same proportions of cobra venom killed a fowl in\r\nthirty minutes. Nicholson affirms that the Russell’s viper can eject\r\nas much poison in half a second as a cobra can in three seconds. But\r\nif the viper be in a torpid condition, it might eject little or none.\r\nA strong Daboia bit a feeble bull, which died; but two feeble Daboias\r\nbit a strong bull, which recovered. These latter vipers were moulting,\r\nand their functions were inactive—the bites feeble, perhaps. In fact,\r\nthe conditions are so many and great, that after all it is hazardous\r\nto form any definite conclusion. Some notes of the effects on bitten\r\nanimals, taken at the Zoological Gardens while the snakes were being\r\nfed, shall be faithfully recorded in the ensuing chapter.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the many drugs used in various countries for the cure of\r\nsnake-bite, it is curious to note that, as a rule, they are procured\r\nfrom the most deadly plants. As ‘like cures like,’ so poison cures\r\npoison. Most of them are powerful stimulants, in which lies their\r\nchief virtue. Among them are _aristolochia_, _opium_, _ipecacuanha_,\r\n_senega-root_, _guaco_ or _huaco_, _asclepias_, _liatris_, _euphorbia_,\r\n_polygala_, _ophiorrhiza_, etc. A long list might be written. It is\r\nnoteworthy, too, that the natives of the countries in which these\r\nplants are variously found, have strong faith in them, and indeed\r\nuse them with more or less of success. The early writers on America\r\nentertained no sort of doubt as to the efficacy of the plants or\r\npreparations used by the Indians. Purchas, in 1626, after describing\r\nthe ‘_Ibiracua_, which causeth by his biting the Bloud to issue thorow\r\nall Parts of the Bodie, Eyes, Mouth, Nose, Eares,’ etc., says: ‘But\r\nthe Indians are acquainted with a certaine Herbe that will heal their\r\nWoundes.’ Lawson, Berkeley, and Catesby tell us the Indians were\r\nnever without a remedy, which they carried about with them, but the\r\npreparation of which differed in each tribe. Border Americans of the\r\npresent day, also, are never at a loss when snake-bitten, though the\r\nmost popular of modern remedies is whisky. (Not that this offers any\r\nexception to the rule, that poison kills poison; the comic philosophy\r\nbeing that whisky, as the stronger poison of the two, ‘goes in for\r\nfirst innings, so to speak.’)\r\n\r\nSome of the poisonous antidotal plants in South America are used in the\r\npreparation of the celebrated _wourali_ or _curare_, with which the\r\nIndians poison their arrows. Snake-venom and pounded fangs are also\r\nconstituents of this, which is why the effect in the blood—as has been\r\nshown in experiments—is similar to that of snake-bite. Some of the\r\ntribes are said to acquire immunity from the most virulent snakes by\r\nswallowing the potent herbs of their region. Inoculation with deadly\r\nvegetable juices is another of their remedies; and Tschudi informs us\r\nthat after this inoculation, snake-bites are harmless for some time,\r\nbut that the process has to be repeated. Sullivan has not much faith\r\nin the process; nor has Dr. Stradling. But there is one undeniable\r\nfact connected with the poisonous snakes of most countries, viz. that\r\ndeath by them is comparatively rare; and only in India do we hear of\r\nthousands dying annually. Dr. Carpenter, Humboldt, and, I believe,\r\nother writers of equal weight, have suggested that the poisonous plants\r\nused by native tribes, both internally and externally, may impart to\r\nthe person an odour which is repugnant to snakes; and if this be the\r\ncase, how would it be to institute compulsory inoculation among the\r\nlow-caste Hindoos, who are the chief sufferers in India? Or, could\r\nnot a few pariah dogs there be inoculated with the juice of some of\r\nthe native plants, such as the ‘earth gall’ of Malay (_Ophiorrhiza\r\nmungos_), as the Indians of the Orinoco protect themselves with the\r\n_Vejuco de huaco_? Should the process succeed with valueless animals,\r\nit might afterwards be attempted in human beings. Perhaps already it\r\nhas been attempted, and it would be gratifying could I flatter myself\r\nthat it was through my suggestions of several years ago. Or I may be\r\nonly betraying my own ignorance of surgery and of the pharmacopeia in\r\nsuggesting it at all.\r\n\r\nThere are many popular vegetable ‘antidotes’ of the log cabin and the\r\nrough border-clearings of America, but the ‘faculty’ form no high\r\nestimate of them. Dr. Weir Mitchel tested some twenty or thirty plants\r\nwhich owe their reputation to Indian traditions, but without success.\r\n‘In the hands of science they failed.’ But then is there not always\r\nsome delay before the patient can reach the hands of science? It is\r\nthe prompt treatment, and having the remedies always ready, that may\r\nensure success among the natives. Probably many a bitten person, if\r\nalone in the desert, dies, and there are none to record his death.\r\nNevertheless we have good reason for believing that the natives do\r\nlearn how to manage deadly snakes or to avoid them. In South Africa\r\nit is very rare to hear of a person dying of snake-bite; and the\r\nnatives go bare-footed there as much as in India. Some of the deadliest\r\nserpents also are found in Africa. In Australia, where there is a\r\nstill larger majority of poisonous snakes (more than two-thirds of the\r\nwhole number), and also bare-footed natives, deaths are comparatively\r\ninfrequent. Krefft gives us a list which may be of interest to the\r\nresidents there, viz. the proportions of the venomous to the harmless\r\nspecies of snakes:—\r\n\r\n                   Venomous.  Harmless.\r\n\r\n  New South Wales,     21 out of 30\r\n\r\n  Victoria,             8    ”   12\r\n\r\n  South Australia,     13    ”   15\r\n\r\n  West Australia,      11    ”   15\r\n\r\n  Queensland,          28    ”   42\r\n\r\nWhereas in India, including Ceylon, the venomous families are five\r\nto the thirty-five innocuous ones. In India alone Günther describes\r\ntwenty families of snakes, out of which four only are venomous. When,\r\ntherefore, we read the annual statistics of India, and the enormous\r\ndeath-rate, which suggest resolutions towards the extermination of\r\nsnakes, we may again hint that education must join hands with science\r\nin order to find remedies. Europeans are seldom bitten; you might count\r\nthe numbers on your fingers in as many years. Dr. Edward Nicholson\r\nhas shown that while in twelve years (1860-1871 inclusive) only four\r\nBritish soldiers died from snake-bite, thirty-eight died from the bite\r\nof mad dogs; and he thinks it would be more beneficial to the community\r\nto kill off some of the hordes of these dangerous animals which infest\r\nthe country during the summer months. Moreover, that ‘_in comparison\r\nwith preventible diseases and a percentage of the entire population,\r\nsnake-bites are sensational trifles_.’ He thinks the savage crusade\r\nagainst snakes worse than useless, and argues that it would be better\r\nto seek remedies for diseases that harm more Europeans in a week than\r\nsnakes do in a century. Others tell us that the number of deaths is\r\ngreatly exaggerated, and that many by violence or through fatalism and\r\nbarbarities are set down to snakes.\r\n\r\nBut to return to remedies, one would suppose that drugs or plants which\r\nkill venomous snakes would be also cures for their bites. It is an old\r\nbelief that vipers contain in themselves an ‘antidote’ to their venom,\r\nand hence the number of popular medicines prepared from their bodies.\r\nConversely, some of the deadly poisons of the pharmacopeia are death to\r\nsnakes. _Aristolochia_ produces powerful effects on the African vipers;\r\nthe white ash (_Fraxinius Americanus_) is an equally rapid poison\r\nto the rattlesnake, as Prof. Silliman proved. It is said that these\r\nreptiles are never found in the vicinity of this tree. It was the white\r\nash which Oliver Wendell Holmes introduced into his story of ‘Elsie\r\nVenner,’ as being destructive to _crotalus_ life, and the novelist\r\nwrote from his experience of its effects. Similar cases have been\r\nrecorded in the _Philosophical Transactions_. Pennyroyal, says Charas,\r\nwas held to the nose of a viper, ‘who by turning and wriggling laboured\r\nhard to avoid it; and in half an hour’s time was killed by it. This\r\nwas in July, at which season these creatures are computed to be in the\r\ngreatest vigour of their poison’ (1657).\r\n\r\nAnother drug which is poison to a venomous snake is _tobacco_, within\r\nthe reach of most persons. This, among native remedies, has always been\r\nin favour, and we have heard of its efficacy ever since ‘the weed’\r\nwas known to Europeans. Various species of tobacco and its allies\r\nare indigenous to most tropical countries, and probably were in use\r\nfor both man and snake-bites long before civilised nations took such\r\ncomfort in smoking. In classic ages it was believed that human saliva\r\nwas fatal to vipers, and it is even affirmed that the Hottentots often\r\nkill a puff adder by merely spitting upon it. One must infer from this\r\nthat their saliva is saturated with some drug which they chew; and\r\nfrom classic authors we might discover that the practice of chewing\r\ntobacco, opium, or other drugs obnoxious to snakes, was in use from\r\nvery early ages. Those classic authors who tell us that human saliva is\r\nfatal to snakes had not studied snake nature enough to assign a reason\r\nfor this, though in all probability a reason did exist. ‘Man carries\r\nmore poison in his mouth than a snake,’ said an old Virginian writer,\r\nalluding to _nicotine_. ‘He can poison a rattlesnake more quickly than\r\nit can him.’ Nicholson states that it also rapidly affects a cobra, and\r\nhe recommends it, should you wish to destroy the snake uninjured: ‘You\r\nhave,’ he says, ‘but to blow into its mouth a drop or two of the oil\r\nfrom a dirty tobacco-pipe.’\r\n\r\nTwo young men chopping wood together in Virginia espied a rattlesnake.\r\nWith a forked stick one of them held its head close to the ground,\r\nkeeping its body constrained with his foot, while his comrade took\r\nfrom his own mouth a quid of tobacco, which he forced into that of the\r\nsnake. The reptile was then released, and had not crawled a couple of\r\nyards before it was convulsed, swelling and dying within a short time.\r\nLeaves of tobacco as a plaister, or chopped tobacco as a poultice,\r\nare applied to a bite by the American backwoodsmen, after the custom\r\nof the Indians; or finely chopped tobacco, mixed with moist gunpowder\r\nand some pulverized sulphur, formed into a plaister, and laid on the\r\nwound, and then set fire to. Tschudi, in his _Travels in Peru_, p. 434,\r\nsaw this remedy successfully applied by an Indian to his wife’s bitten\r\nfoot. A nausea-exciting drug was swallowed at the same time. With the\r\ncopper-head snake (_Ancistrodon contortrix_) it is equally efficacious.\r\nThese and rattlesnakes are said to be never found in tobacco fields.\r\n\r\nStrychnine appears to have a similar effect to tobacco on snakes.\r\nFayrer found cobras extremely susceptible to the influence of\r\nstrychnine. An almost impalpable quantity caused a cobra to ‘twist\r\nitself up in a rigid series of coils and die.’\r\n\r\nA good many experiments have been tried by a subcutaneous injection\r\nof strychnine into dogs and other animals, immediately after being\r\nbitten, but without sufficient success to warrant the adoption of it\r\nas an infallible remedy. In some of the cases, indeed, the deaths from\r\ntetanus suggest the question, ‘Did the cats and dogs die from venom,\r\nor from strychnine?’ As virulent poisons are administered in virulent\r\ncases, how would it be to _swallow_ strychnine in chemically-prepared\r\ndoses?\r\n\r\nCarbolic acid is another drug which produces powerful effects, causing\r\nthe reptile to ‘double itself up in numerous folds, remaining as stiff\r\nas if cast in metal.’ Creosote, also, snakes hate, Fayrer tells us, and\r\nrecommends that these two drugs may at least be of use in driving them\r\naway from dwellings, as many of them have an objectionably domestic\r\ndisposition. A few drops of carbolic acid poured on the floor of their\r\ncages kill venomous snakes in a very short time. A large _Bungarus_\r\ndied in ten minutes in this way.\r\n\r\nDr. Weir Mitchel approves of carbolic acid so far as to recommend\r\nevery backwoodsman to supply himself with a little of it, which is\r\neasily portable and manageable in capillary tubes. In several of his\r\nexperiments with _crotalus_ venom, carbolic acid applied to the wound\r\nwas attended with success. But it must be _done at once_. The whole\r\nsecret of cures—when cures can be effected at all—lies in promptness.\r\nIt is celerity on the part of the Indians which ensures their success.\r\nIn an instant, if his comrade be bitten, the savage is on his knees,\r\nsucking the wound, grasping the limb firmly, or strapping it tightly\r\nabove and below the bite, knowing quite well the importance of checking\r\nthe circulation. He has his ‘poison pills,’ and tobacco in his pouch.\r\nHe explodes gunpowder on the wound and loses not an instant. Nor does\r\nthe victim lose heart. He submits with courage and confidence, and\r\nin these lie another element of success. Many cases are on record\r\nof persons being at death’s door through fear alone, when bitten by\r\na harmless snake, but recovering on being assured that there was no\r\ndanger. And other cases are well known where bitten persons have died\r\nof fright and the depressing influences surrounding the accident, when\r\nthey might possibly have recovered.\r\n\r\nAnd assuredly the remedies are generally so severe as to be in\r\nthemselves sufficiently terrifying. ‘No time for reflection;’ ‘no\r\nmercy must be shown,’ declares Sir Joseph Fayrer, in describing the\r\nincredible rapidity with which the venom inoculates the blood ‘in a\r\nmoment of time.’ Where a deep wound has been inflicted by a highly\r\nvenomous snake on a small animal, death has been known to occur in a\r\nfew seconds, especially if the bite were on a large vein or an artery.\r\nTherefore if the bite be on a limb, to tie a ligature is the first\r\nthing to be done. A thong of leather, a tape, a string, a cord, a\r\ngarment torn in shreds, anything that can be caught up, must at once\r\nbe tied round the limb. Every instant of delay increases the danger.\r\nIncredible force must be used to tighten the ligature, which even with\r\na tourniquet or a stick to twist the cord to the utmost is scarcely\r\nsufficient to completely stop the circulation in the fleshy part of\r\na limb. So tight as to cut into the flesh is frequently necessary.\r\nIn the case of a dog whose hind leg had been bitten, such amazing\r\nforce was required, in one of Fayrer’s experiments, that with the\r\nstrength of a pair of hands it was almost impossible to tighten the\r\nligature sufficiently to effect complete strangulation. In another of\r\nhis experiments a chicken had a ligature tightened round its thigh\r\n‘with the greatest amount of tension that a man’s hand could exert.’\r\nThe poor chicken (already half dead with terror and pain, as one must\r\nconjecture) was then bitten below the ligature by a cobra, but in spite\r\nof the thorough strangulation of the limb, the fowl showed signs of\r\npoison in twenty-three minutes, and in three-quarters of an hour was\r\ndead. These two among other cases are cited to show that the mere\r\ntying of a tape or a pocket handkerchief round a bitten limb is of very\r\nlittle use, provided it is not drawn tight enough to almost cut into\r\nthe flesh. Yet this is only the first step; for if assistants are at\r\nhand, let them tie a second or even a third such ligature above and\r\nbelow the bite when possible, while whoever is best able to operate\r\nmust scarify the wound by cutting it across deeply, or by immediately\r\ncupping, letting it bleed freely; ‘better still,’ says Sir Joseph, ‘cut\r\nit out deeply and quickly.’ In the case of a finger or a toe, ‘amputate\r\ninstantly; for if once the venom is absorbed into the system, there\r\nis but the slenderest chance of life.’ If the wound be in a fleshy\r\npart, force a red-hot iron to the very bottom of it, and burn it out\r\nto the depth of half an inch, or when excised fill it with gunpowder\r\nand explode that, or force a live coal into it, or burn it out with\r\ncarbolic or nitric acid! Agonizing though the remedies be, they are\r\ninevitable, should the bite be inflicted by one of the larger and\r\ndeadlier snakes in a part where absorption is rapid. ‘Do not relax the\r\nligament till the part be cold and livid,’ adds Fayrer.\r\n\r\nNor, when we look at the effects of a bite, can we wonder at the\r\nseverity of the remedies.\r\n\r\n‘Vomiting black fluid,’ ‘bleeding at every orifice of the body,’ are\r\namong the horrible sufferings at the time; an injured constitution and\r\nhideous sores likely to break out afresh periodically in various parts,\r\nmay be some of the after consequences should the patient recover.\r\n\r\nAs the effect of the bite is depressing, the system must be kept up\r\nwith strong stimulants. Food is of little use, because the functions\r\nare too feeble to digest it. But great faith is placed in stimulants.\r\nHence the popularity of ammonia, which is quickly diffusible. The\r\nvenom exhausts the vital forces; therefore, excepting in the local\r\nsurgical treatment, all the best remedies are volatile and alcoholic\r\nstimulants. Ammonia in the form of _eau de luce_ has long been\r\napproved, both taken internally and rubbed into the wound. Professor\r\nHalford’s plan of subcutaneously injecting it has been very successful\r\nin some cases of Australian snake-bites, and the popularity of this\r\nmode has been seen in the large number of hypodermic syringes purchased\r\nby persons in the bush. But the use of these requires surgical skill;\r\nand awkward attempts by the laity have produced wounds which have been\r\nprejudicial to the originator; for though it is said that some attempts\r\nof this kind were made by Fontana about one hundred years ago, Halford\r\ncould not have been aware of that, since he claims to be the first who\r\nventured to throw ammonia directly into the blood. ‘Previously to my\r\nexperiments in 1868,’ he says, ‘it had never been thought possible to\r\nthrow ten or twenty minims of the strongest liquid ammonia directly\r\ninto the veins without killing the man on the spot.’[145] He first\r\ntried it on animals, and finding it successful, at length ventured\r\nthis ‘mode of treatment’ with human beings; since which other doctors\r\nin Australia have also practised it. Still he does not claim for it\r\ninfallibility, though giving some cases in which the action of ammonia\r\non the blood and on the heart’s action produced rapid recovery in\r\npersons apparently dying.\r\n\r\nAny technical explanation must not be attempted by me; but those who\r\nare interested in this subject will find Prof. Halford’s own accounts\r\nin the _Medical Times_ for 1873 and ensuing years, also in his paper\r\n‘On the Condition of the Blood from Snake-bite,’ 1867.\r\n\r\nIn India similar kinds of experiments were not attended with success;\r\nleading to the conclusion that the Indian snakes were more deadly\r\nthan those in Australia. Climate, latitude, season, and many other\r\ncircumstances affect the virulence of snakes, as we may here repeat.\r\nThe ‘Brown’ or ‘Tiger snake’ (_Hoplocephalus curtus_), the ‘Black\r\nsnake’ (_Pseudechis porphyriacus_), _Hoplocephalus superbus_, and some\r\nother of the larger venomous kinds _within the tropics_ are thought to\r\nbe equal in virulence to the Indian ones of the same bulk in the same\r\nseason. Many of them erect themselves and distend their necks like the\r\n_najas_.\r\n\r\nAnd now for a few words about the most popular and perhaps most\r\nattainable of all remedies—alcohol! No wonder the backwoodsman resorts\r\nto this, which without any chopping off of fingers or toes, or personal\r\npyrotechnics, or other local tortures, deadens his sensibilities,\r\nrenders him unconscious of suffering, and sends him into a happy\r\nobliviousness of danger. It is not a refined mode of treatment, nor one\r\nthat presents many opportunities of exhibiting professional skill; and\r\nit is no doubt somewhat derogatory to admit that to become dead drunk\r\nis an effective victory against snake venom! Other old and inelegant\r\nremedies we hear of as practised by the Bushmen of South Africa,\r\nand savage tribes elsewhere, but revolting in the hands of refined\r\npractitioners. Deference to science and loyalty to the profession\r\ndemand some more elaborate means. Yet the efficacy of whisky or brandy\r\nis admitted by all, and the pioneer who has not a doctor within miles\r\nof him has his demijohn of whisky at hand.\r\n\r\nDuring a sojourn in Iowa some years ago, when wild and uncleared lands\r\nformed the ‘streets’ of the town in which I was staying—Lyons on the\r\nMississippi river, and as lovely a spot as artists and botanists can\r\nwish to revel in—it was by no means an infrequent occurrence to hear\r\nof rattlesnake bites. ‘What was done to the man?’ ‘Is he alive?’ were\r\nquestions naturally asked.\r\n\r\n‘He drank a quart of raw whisky, and got dead drunk.’\r\n\r\nGenerally a quart had the desired effect—that is, of causing\r\nintoxication. Persons unused to intoxicants might be affected by a less\r\nquantity, but so violent is the combat between venom and whisky that a\r\nlarge dose must be swallowed before any effects at all are produced. In\r\nthe southern and hotter States it was similarly used. Indeed, a planter\r\nhimself told me that Sambo would sometimes prick his hand or foot with\r\na thorn, and crying out ‘Rattlesnake!’ fall into well-assumed agonies,\r\nin his preference for a spirituous somniferousness to cotton-picking.\r\nBut when the fraud was detected and less enticing remedies were\r\nadopted, rattlesnake or copper-head bites became less frequent. I\r\nheard of a man in Nevada, George Terhune, a teamster (I give his name,\r\nhaving every reason to believe the truth of the story), who was bitten\r\nin the hand by a rattlesnake while stooping to reach some water out\r\nof a spring. The man was alone and far away from human habitations.\r\nIt was an instinctive and momentary business to first kill the snake\r\nthen rushing to his waggon, he drew the bung from a keg of whisky and\r\ntook a large draught of the contents. After swallowing as much as\r\nhe could, he took some tobacco from his pocket, saturated that with\r\nwhisky, and applied this poultice to his hand. He then proceeded with\r\nhis team, drinking whisky at intervals until he reached a dwelling,\r\nwhen he removed the poultice and found that the wound had turned green.\r\nApplying another of the same kind, he resumed his journey and his\r\npotent doses, reaching his destination next day ‘as sober as a judge,’\r\nhaving imbibed enough ‘fire-water’ to intoxicate a dozen men with no\r\n_crotalus_ venom in their veins. The quantity sometimes swallowed under\r\nsuch circumstances is utterly incredible.\r\n\r\nProfessor Halford describes a case of snake-bite near Melbourne,\r\nin which two bottles of brandy were drunk without any symptoms of\r\nintoxication; and another of a girl of fourteen, who, when bitten by\r\nan Australian snake, drank three bottles without being intoxicated!\r\nShe recovered. ‘Alcohol has powerful attractions for oxygen,’ writes\r\nProfessor Halford, on the theory that the venom has produced foreign\r\ncells in the blood, ‘so that if alcohol engage the oxygen absorbed by\r\nthe poison, the cells perish and recovery ensues.’ Others among the\r\nablest experimentalists similarly recognise the efficacy of alcohol.\r\nDr. Shortt of Madras says: ‘Bring the patient under the influence\r\nof intoxication as speedily as possible. Make him drunk, and keep\r\nhim drunk, until the virus is overcome.’ Dr. Weir Mitchel found that\r\ndelicate women and young children under the influence of snake poison\r\ncould take ‘quarts of brandy without injury, and almost without\r\neffect.’ One man brought to him—a man of temperate habits—took\r\none quart of brandy and half a pint of whisky, which ‘only slightly\r\nintoxicated him for about four hours.’ Another man bitten in the throat\r\nwas cured at the end of twenty-four hours, during which time he had\r\nhad two quarts of whisky in one night, and renewed as the pulse fell,\r\nbesides red pepper and other stimulants.[146]\r\n\r\nIn South Africa, too, the alcoholic remedies seem to be successfully\r\nadopted, so far as we may judge by occasional reports of them which\r\nfind their way into print. In the _Field_ of January 14th, 1882, a\r\nMr. Walter Nightingale records that a boy of fifteen, bitten by a\r\npuff adder, drank two bottles of brandy before it had any effect;\r\nand a little girl two years old, bitten in the hand by a ‘horned\r\nviper’ (which might have been a _Lophophrys_ or _Vipera nasicornis_),\r\nhad administered to her brandy and milk in occasional doses without\r\nany visible effects, until a whole bottle of brandy had been thus\r\nswallowed! The child recovered; and the force of the argument seemed to\r\nrest on the astounding quantity of strong spirit that could be taken\r\nto overcome the venom without producing intoxication. Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, a wine-glassful of brandy would have made either of\r\nthose children tipsy, yet the infant of two years did not reel under\r\na whole bottleful, and the boy of fifteen under two bottles full—a\r\nquantity that would have killed many outright.\r\n\r\nYet whisky is not an ‘antidote’ chemically, any more than is ammonia,\r\nor tobacco, or artificial respiration, which latter has been tried\r\nwith success by Drs. Vincent Richards and Lauder Bruton. So rapidly\r\ndestructive to every vital function is snake venom, that anything that\r\nwill keep life going until the poison is eliminated is desirable; and\r\nwhat would themselves be poisons in other cases here act only as\r\ncounterfoils. ‘A septic of astounding virulence,’ Weir Mitchel has\r\nproved _crotalus_ venom to be; and the scientific experimentalists on\r\nthe Oriental thanatophidia confirm his words as regard the _najas_ and\r\nvipers of their own regions. A subtle, malignant, mysterious fluid, to\r\nwhich all animal life succumbs. Even vegetables are affected by it, as\r\nMitchel proved. Inoculated with it, they looked dead next day as if\r\nscathed by lightning. So those old writers on Virginian serpents might\r\nnot have been so far wrong after all, so far as the injurious effect\r\nof venom on a young tree; only they made a slight mistake in supposing\r\nthat the ‘thorny tail’ inflicted the mischief (p. 174).\r\n\r\nIt is not within the compass of this work to attempt to describe\r\nin detail the many remedies which from time to time have enjoyed a\r\nshort-lived popularity; such as ‘snake stones,’ the ‘Tangore pill,’\r\nand other preparations. Conventions have within the last twenty\r\nyears been held in India, in Australia, in America, and London; and\r\nCommissioners from among our most distinguished M.D.’s have been\r\nappointed to investigate all the reputed ‘antidotes’ and popular\r\nremedies that could be got together. The names of Dr. Ewart, Dr. Lauder\r\nBruton, and Dr. Vincent Richards of the Indian Medical Department,\r\nas associated with artificial respiration, must be familiar to many.\r\nDr. Shortt, of Madras, claims originality in the use of potash, _liq.\r\npotassæ_, which both by the mouth and by injection has been attended\r\nwith success. He has recorded several cures by _liq. pot._, ‘not as\r\nmiraculous, but as rational.’ He affirms that it has the property of\r\nneutralizing the venom, and that brandy expedites it by carrying it\r\nrapidly through the system. Potash or soda plentifully applied to the\r\nwound is a popular remedy also among the border pioneers of America,\r\nwho, on the theory that venom is of an acid nature, make frequent use\r\nof alkalis. The child of a gentleman whom I knew in Virginia was bitten\r\non the foot by a rattlesnake; his whole body quickly exhibited the\r\nsymptoms of the poison. But the father was so confident of the success\r\nof his own domestic treatment that he did not even send for a doctor.\r\n‘_Saleratus_’ (used in cookery) was bound upon the bitten spot, and the\r\nchild was dosed with apple brandy until stupefied. Next day he was well.\r\n\r\nFrom all the ‘recoveries’ above quoted, it may be said that the bites\r\ncould not have been very deep, or that the snakes could not have been\r\nvery virulent; and in the many hundreds of experiments tried in India\r\nand elsewhere, the doctors have arrived at similar conclusions. _A full\r\ncharge of venom injected directly into the veins, should no remedy be\r\nattempted, is almost certain to be fatal._ Within half an hour a man\r\nmight die from a vigorous _crotalus_, _fer de lance_, or large _elaps_.\r\n\r\nIt is important to impress this on the reader, lest from the cures\r\nabove cited, I appear to argue that snake-bite is not so serious an\r\naffair after all. Notwithstanding that the South American Indians, in\r\nthe midst of the most deadly of the _Crotalidæ_, do fly confidently to\r\ntheir _guaco_ and their traditional remedies, they know so well when\r\nthere is no chance of recovery that they attempt no cures whatever.\r\nTravellers tell us they lay themselves down to die when bitten by\r\ncertain snakes; probably they know that, from the position of the bite,\r\nor the accidental lack of essential remedies, there is no hope for\r\nthem. They are said to resign hope when bitten by the little Peruvian\r\nviper (_Echis ocellata_), in the very heart of the tropics, and as\r\ndeadly as the little _echis_ of India. In every case the symptoms point\r\nto the exhaustion of the nerve centres, and the rapid decomposition of\r\nthe blood.\r\n\r\nThe venom appears to be an indestructible fluid. Toxically it remains\r\nunaltered whether boiled or frozen, or mixed with the strongest\r\ncorrosives. Diluted in water, alcohol, or blood, it is still equally\r\ninjurious. The blood of an animal killed by a bite, if injected into\r\nthe veins of another animal, kills that one also; and the blood of\r\nthe second one killed is similarly fatal to a third, and the third\r\nto the fourth, and so on through a series of animals. Also so small\r\na quantity is fatal where no remedies are attempted, that a venomous\r\nserpent can kill six or eight animals one after another; each one,\r\nbitten in succession, succumbing more slowly, it is true, but still\r\ndying at last. Fayrer found that no less than nine creatures could\r\nthus be affected by one cobra. A dog, a pigeon, and seven fowls were\r\nbitten one after the other: the dog, first bitten and receiving the\r\nlargest injection of venom, died in thirty-three minutes; a fowl, next\r\nbitten, in three minutes; the third, in ten minutes; the fourth bitten,\r\nin eleven; the fifth, in seventeen minutes; but the ninth bitten, a\r\nfowl, when the poison gland was exhausted, recovered after a time. And\r\nthe same effect is seen in much larger animals than fowls. Fayrer also\r\ntells of four men bitten in succession by one cobra, only the last one\r\nbitten receiving treatment, and recovering-slowly after many days. The\r\nfacts prove the fatal confidence placed in snake-charmers, if further\r\nproofs be needed. The four men, on payment of money, were to be taught\r\nthe ‘spells,’ _müntras_, etc., and, as they hoped, to be endowed with\r\ncurative powers. The professional ‘snake men’ bullied them into playing\r\nwith a cobra and irritating it, with the promise that no harm should\r\nfollow, even if they were bitten, which one of them very soon was,\r\nfalling senseless immediately, and dying within an hour. Not warned by\r\nthe utter failure of ‘charms’ to restore their comrade, the other three\r\npermitted themselves to be bitten. The strongest charge of venom having\r\nbeen expended in the first bite, the man next bitten did not fail so\r\nrapidly, the third still more slowly, but both died the next day. When\r\nthe fourth was bitten, the police were informed of what was going on,\r\nand they carried him off to the hospital, and the charmers to prison.\r\nThus is the death-rate swelled.\r\n\r\nThough the venom may be swallowed with impunity by a thoroughly healthy\r\nperson, there is always danger of its being absorbed through the\r\ndelicate membranes of the throat and stomach. In cases of sore throat,\r\ninjured gums or lips, or internal maladies, the risk would be great,\r\nof course. Animals killed by the venom are constantly eaten, Fayrer\r\nstates; and that the hungry natives eagerly carried off the fowls\r\nupon which he had experimented. Since those celebrated experiments\r\nat Florence by the ‘Florentine Philosopher,’ Redi, and those other\r\n‘Knowing Physicians’ above two hundred years ago, the venom has been\r\nswallowed by many. The great point of discussion then was to ascertain\r\nthe source of the ‘Mischiefs;’ whether they arose in the gall or the\r\n‘Juyce of the Bag at the root of the Master Teeth;’ and Redi tasted\r\nboth the Gall and the ‘Spittle from the Bag’ in order to test this\r\ngreat question, and found ‘the Gall sharp and the Spittle flat.’ As the\r\nlearned physicians of the nineteenth century have been again trying\r\neffects, so did those ‘Knowing Physicians’ work out similar problems\r\nin 1670, no doubt suggesting many things that have subsequently been\r\nsolved and perfected. One Francini was hard to convince that only a\r\ntooth and not a demoniacal spirit inflicted the injury; whereupon,\r\nto convince that unbeliever, they thrust a thorn and a pin into the\r\nbreast of a fowl, which betrayed no ill effects; but a splinter of wood\r\ncovered with ‘Spittle from the Bag’ killed a pigeon as quickly as the\r\n‘Master Tooth.’ They showed, also, that a dissevered head was able to\r\nbite, and its ‘Biting is as dangerous as when the Viper is entire.’\r\nThey proved other things, too numerous to recount; and particularly,\r\nthat venom was not injurious in a healthy stomach, the question from\r\nwhich we have strayed to Florence.\r\n\r\nLately we have been led to think that it is something more than\r\nharmless. Through the researches of Professors Selmi, Lacerda, Gautier,\r\nand others, we learn that from the powerful peptic properties of\r\nthe venom it may become a valuable medicine. I think I am correct\r\nin stating that a Dr. C. Hering of Philadelphia, when practising in\r\nBritish Guiana some forty years ago, introduced the venom of our\r\ncelebrated Curucucu (_Lachesis mutus_) into medicine; and that since\r\nthen, serpent venoms have held an important place in the Homœopathic\r\nPharmacopeia. Already we have hinted at the digestive properties of\r\nvenom to the serpents themselves, that neither masticate nor take\r\nexercise otherwise to promote digestion; and there are those among\r\nus who, not lacking energy so much as time, and whose busy brains\r\npermit them but little leisure for either exercise or the unhurried\r\nmeal, may be glad by and by to resort to a poison pill to cure the\r\n‘dyspepsia’ they thus bring upon themselves. Our American cousins will\r\nhail with joy such a discovery. Perhaps even now they are anticipating\r\na prize medal at the next Great International Exhibition, for a\r\nnewly-invented ‘Extract of Bushmaster’ as the infallible remedy.\r\n_American Bothropine_.—‘One drop of this extract in a wine-glassful of\r\nwater taken immediately after dinner ensures that meal being swallowed\r\nin three minutes with impunity.’ Would not this deserve a gold medal in\r\nthese days when one man tries to do the work of three?\r\n\r\nDrs. Lacerda and Netto of Brazil have proved that crotaline venom acts\r\nas a solvent on hard-boiled egg and other albuminous substances,—that\r\nit can, as it were, digest living tissues; and Dr. Stradling thinks\r\nthat this solvent or disintegrating power will in some measure\r\naccount for the intense local severity of a venomous snake-bite, ‘so\r\ndisproportionately wide-spread to the tiny punctures made by the\r\nneedle-like tooth.’\r\n\r\nThe excision of the fang does not check the function of the poison\r\ngland any more than the extraction of a tooth will check the salivary\r\nsecretions in a human mouth, because (as was described in the chapter\r\non ‘Dentition’) there are other fangs coming forward and requiring\r\nsimilar supplies.\r\n\r\nOne great value in experimental snake-bites by subcutaneous injection\r\nis knowing which specific venom, or how much of it, produces certain\r\neffects. But there is this to be said with regard to the creatures\r\noperated upon, that the restraint, terror, and pain necessarily\r\ninflicted before the venom is injected, must do a great deal towards\r\nrendering that victim predisposed to succumb under ever so small a\r\ndose; and in some cases 6, 8, or 10 drops of venom have been injected.\r\nIf terror and timidity act so strongly on a nervous human subject,\r\nthey must act similarly on such feeble, frightened creatures as fowls,\r\nrabbits, and guinea-pigs, that are held, strapped down, and tortured by\r\nligaments and lancets.\r\n\r\nHuman beings may take courage in reflecting that in some of the\r\nexperiments under which animals have died, _in spite of immediate\r\nremedies_, a far larger dose of venom has been injected than could\r\npossibly pass through the fang in one normal bite. The virulence of the\r\nvenom in ever so minute a quantity has been proved sadly enough; yet\r\nthe possibility and hope of recovery are also evident.\r\n\r\n‘As prevention is better than cure,’ those who run risk in the tropics\r\ncan guard against bites by wearing thick coverings to their feet and\r\nankles in the way of gaiters, leather boots; and denser materials for\r\nclothing, in preference to those which the finely-pointed fangs can\r\neasily penetrate. The cloth or leather may then receive the principal\r\ncharge of venom. Silk as a lining is good, and has the advantage of\r\ncoolness. Anything rather than bare feet. Then supplies of ammonia,\r\ntobacco, carbolic acid, and strong tape are easily portable, and\r\nplenty of good whisky, if the bearer can courageously _keep it for\r\nemergencies_.\r\n\r\nThe mongoose of classic reputation must have a passing mention;\r\nthough it is now pretty well understood that this little animal\r\nowes its safety to its own bravery and adroitness, more than to any\r\nsupposititious herb to which it flies. Not but what instinct may\r\ninduce it to eat of the plants nature provides to animals as to men,\r\nand as a cat eats grass when nature dictates a necessity for physic.\r\nThe mongoose has been known to die of snake-bite like other bitten\r\nanimals, though it certainly succumbs more slowly than many. Vitality\r\nis stronger in some animals than in others. A rat is hard to kill;\r\nand a cat will resist the poison as long as a dog of three times its\r\nsize. Then if mongooses feed on venomous snakes, they may enjoy in\r\nthemselves a sort of protective or prophylactic security. Their long\r\nfur is also protective, leaving but few vulnerable points; and their\r\nstrong vitality enables them to escape and probably overcome the bite\r\nif slight, or to hide away and die unseen.\r\n\r\nThe question of immunity from bites suggests yet one other point on\r\nwhich some uncertainty exists, viz. Do snakes die of their own bites?\r\nDr. E. Nicholson only shall be quoted here, because I shall be able\r\nto introduce some cases from personal observation in the ensuing\r\nchapter, concluding this with just one foreign example which may be\r\nrelied upon. ‘According to my experience,’ says Nicholson, ‘the poison\r\nof venomous snakes affects not only harmless ones, but also venomous\r\nsnakes of other genera.’ My own opinion is that they can kill not only\r\nother snakes, but even themselves if the charge of venom be strong\r\nenough. What has occasionally been seen in print of ‘snakes committing\r\nsuicide,’ is, I think, only from an instinct in the serpent to strike\r\nat what injured it _where_ injured. It feels a sudden pain and turns\r\nto avenge the injury, striking itself on the spot where the pain\r\ndirects. A case was recorded in a paper of a cobra having been struck\r\nby a bullet, and instantly twisting round to bite itself on the spot,\r\nand presently dying; and this was called ‘snake suicide.’ It died in\r\npart perhaps from the bullet, and partly from its own venom, which\r\ninjected in anger would be powerful. Several similar cases have come to\r\nmy notice, where snakes have thus attacked themselves when the instinct\r\nhas been evidently to strike the _cause of pain_.\r\n\r\nIn vol. xxii. of _Nature_, p. 40, the case recorded by Mr. S. H. Wintle\r\nfrom Tasmania will, I think, bear this explanation. He pinned a ‘black\r\nsnake’ (probably _Pseudechis porphyriacus_) to the ground with a forked\r\nstick by the middle of the body; instantly coiling round the stick, the\r\nangry snake turned and buried its fangs in itself, making the part wet\r\nwith viscid slime. Hardly had it done this than the coils relaxed; a\r\nperceptible quiver ran through its body; in a few moments more it lay\r\nextended and motionless, open mouthed and gasping, and in three minutes\r\nwas dead. Mr. Wintle examined the snake after death, and found the body\r\n‘bloodless,’ as though the poison had destroyed the colouring matter.\r\nHe tried the blood on a mouse, which died in five minutes; and on a\r\nlizard, which died in fourteen minutes.\r\n\r\nIf the saliva of an angrily-excited human being or a dog be more\r\ninjurious at one time than another, how much more so that of a venomous\r\nserpent. The flow would be greater, the character more noxious. It\r\nseems therefore a mere question of power or virulence, the greater over\r\nthe less. In some cases one serpent might kill another, in other cases\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n_NOTES FROM THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS._\r\n\r\n\r\nARRANGING the following examples, not so much in chronological sequence\r\nas in elucidation of special facts, I will first give some cases of\r\nvenomous serpents killing themselves and each other. My notes began\r\nin 1872, after the interest so strongly awakened in Cheyne Walk,\r\nChelsea, when those tame snakes were fed to gratify our curiosity (see\r\nIntroduction).\r\n\r\nHolland was then the keeper at the Reptile House of the London\r\nZoological Society’s Gardens, and had occupied this place upwards of\r\ntwenty years, gathering much experience and knowledge of reptilian\r\nhabits. Incidents known to him, when not witnessed by myself, may\r\ntherefore be received as trustworthy.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, July 20th, 1873, a ‘River Jack’ (_Vipera rhinoceros_), from\r\nWest Africa, really did kill itself, though the act can scarcely be\r\ncalled intentional ‘suicide.’ It was from dashing its head against\r\nits cage either in anger or pain. Holland was of opinion that it had\r\nbeen severely bitten by one of the others of the same kind in the\r\ncage at the time; for he had known snakes to die from bites in this\r\nway, sometimes from their own bites. On one occasion three Puff adders\r\n(_Vipera arietans_) all died through quarrelling and biting each other.\r\nOne of the three survived ten days, the others dying sooner.\r\n\r\nOne day in April 1873 or 1874, on going to the Gardens, I was informed\r\nthat a water viper (_Cenchris piscivorus_) had been found in the tank\r\nin its cage, presenting a very unusual appearance, and enormously\r\nswelled. On going his rounds that morning, the keeper observed it, and\r\ntouching it with his iron rod, he discovered that it was quite dead.\r\nHe said these vipers frequently quarrel, biting each other and causing\r\nthis great inflation of the body, as if blown out by wind. The vitality\r\nof this species is very strong. From such bites the inflation is\r\nsometimes only temporary, and they recover, but not always. One of them\r\nlived a long while with a broken back. It was endeavouring to escape\r\nby the sliding door, which was raised while the keeper was making some\r\narrangements. The movements of the reptile were so swift that Holland\r\nwas obliged to suddenly drop the slide; and though he succeeded in\r\npartly pushing back the snake, it got caught and was jammed under it,\r\ncompletely dislocating its spine. But it did not appear to suffer very\r\nmuch, he said, and entirely recovered from the injury.\r\n\r\nSome ‘viperine snakes’ (named from their aspect, but not really\r\nvenomous) not only bit each other, but killed and swallowed each other.\r\n\r\nSeveral cases of cobras injuring each other and themselves are on\r\nrecord at the Gardens. On one occasion a cobra got loose, and, as may\r\nbe supposed, created considerable terror. While being caught, it turned\r\nand bit itself, burying its fangs in its own flesh. I could not learn\r\nexactly the spot where it wounded itself; but it was no doubt where the\r\nhooked rod, or the snake tongs, had been offendingly applied.\r\n\r\nA couple of cobras were presented by Sir Joseph Fayrer. One of them\r\nbit the other repeatedly, and in so many places that it was ‘torn\r\nto pieces,’ in the language of the keeper. ‘The body was all over\r\nsores.’ Notwithstanding this, it was several weeks dying. This painful\r\nspectacle did not fall under my own observation, happily, but there is\r\nno reason to doubt the occurrence.\r\n\r\nNext to the rattlesnakes few are more nervously timid than cobras;\r\nonly, while the former displays fear by a shrinking retreat, a cobra\r\nis aggressive, inasmuch as it raises itself with a threatening aspect\r\nand distended hood. It is on account of their extreme timidity that the\r\ncobras’ cages are screened with painted glass at the lower part, or\r\nthe reptiles, in aiming at offending spectators, would be continually\r\ndashing their heads against the front, to their own detriment. In this\r\nmanner snakes wound themselves very seriously, producing various mouth\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nBefore writing another word of what, as a student, I have witnessed at\r\nthe Gardens, I must here affirm that any distressful occurrences are\r\nnot related to gratify a morbid curiosity in those who read only to be\r\namused, but to enable other students to acquire a better insight into\r\nophidian habits and physiology, and as a duty which I have set myself\r\nto accomplish—a duty which has cost much moral courage to carry\r\nout, and which demands, as I now discover, an equal amount of moral\r\ncourage to commit to writing. A good deal is painful, if not revolting;\r\ntherefore I would commend the perusal of this chapter only to those\r\nwho, as naturalists, wish to be informed on these subjects.\r\n\r\n‘Lip fungus,’ gum boils, canker, and abscesses are among the\r\nmouth diseases to which snakes in confinement are subject, and\r\nfor these, very delicate surgical operations have sometimes to be\r\nperformed,—‘very delicate’ often, by reason of the dangerous character\r\nof the patient, and in consideration for the operator as much as for\r\nthe sufferer. The keepers have sometimes to lance the gums, sometimes\r\nto wash the sores! One very venomous patient was so covered with sores\r\nthat the keeper’s only resource was to throw the lotion all over the\r\nreptile.\r\n\r\n‘Why not let the odious serpent die, or kill it at once?’ some will\r\nexclaim. Well, in the first place, many snakes cost large sums of\r\nmoney to purchase; secondly, humanity as well as economy demands that\r\ntheir sufferings should be allayed wherever possible. And in return,\r\nthey frequently reward such care by recovering and entertaining the\r\nvisitors, climbing with renewed vigour about their cages.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, so tenacious of life are some snakes, that they\r\nmight survive as disgusting objects a long while—not in a state to\r\nbe exhibited at all, but only to be an additional care and trouble to\r\nthose whose duty it is to attend to them. One very astonishing instance\r\nof tenacity of life must be introduced. It was in a rattlesnake which\r\nwould not feed, and must have greatly suffered in some way, whether\r\nphysically or from nervous terror cannot be determined; but the\r\nreptile struck its head so repeatedly against the side of its cage,\r\nthat, in the keeper’s words, ‘it completely smashed it.’ At last it\r\ndied, its head one mass of putrid sores; and in that state it had\r\nsustained life for many months. It had eaten nothing for ten months.\r\n\r\nIt must be owing to the excessive and nervous timidity of snakes, that\r\nsome of them reject food for so long a time during the first months of\r\ntheir captivity. I think for even more than two years snakes have been\r\nknown to fast, and to recover their appetite afterwards. So strong a\r\ndisinclination for food do cobras show, when first brought that it is\r\nof no use whatever to put mice into their cages. Now and then, if no\r\none is near them, they will partake of a mouse or a sparrow, but never\r\nuntil they become somewhat reconciled to their surroundings.\r\n\r\nAlmost equally alarmed and irreconciled was the Hamadryad, which is\r\nclosely allied to the cobras. When first brought to the Gardens in\r\nthe spring of 1875, he did little else than suspiciously watch for\r\nsome weeks. With his head elevated in front of the glass, and his hood\r\nexpanded, he made a dash whenever any one approached or stopped to\r\nlook at him, and ate nothing for many days. Within a year these fears\r\ngradually subsided, and he became so tame as to watch for the keeper\r\ninstead of for supposed enemies, raising himself to the roof of his\r\ncage, and remaining close to the little trapdoor at the top, awaiting\r\nthe snake which, as he had already learned, made its appearance through\r\nthere for dinner. Much caution is requisite in feeding him; for though\r\nhe does not now display spite or anger, once let his head find egress\r\nthrough that little trapdoor when raised, he, one of the most venomous\r\nsnakes in existence, would be through in a moment, creating a stampede\r\nindeed among the visitors, to say nothing of danger both to them and to\r\nhimself. He well recognised a change of guardianship when poor Holland\r\nwas compelled from ill-health to resign his place; and not even yet,\r\nin spite of the kindest treatment, will he trust his present keeper\r\nas he trusted Holland. During the interregnum and frequent change of\r\nattendants, his nerves were tried in a manner that he has been slow to\r\nrecover.\r\n\r\nThe Hamadryad’s appointed diet is one ring snake per week; but ‘Ophi,’\r\nas we now call him, is occasionally required—and with no sacrifice of\r\nhis principles either—to eat an extra snake to satisfy the curiosity\r\nof some distinguished visitor. Sometimes, too, colubers are plentiful,\r\nand two small ones are not too much for his ten or twelve feet of\r\nappetite. This splendid serpent has rewarded care by remaining in\r\nperfect health, and growing several feet. He was between eight and\r\nnine feet long when he came, and is now not far short of twelve, and\r\nproportionately larger in circumference. Sometimes during winter,\r\nwhen ring snakes are scarce, ‘Ophio’ is compelled to fast; for, as\r\nrelated p. 62, he is not to be tempted with other food. During the\r\nfirst year of his residence in the Gardens, the supply was good, and\r\nhe ate no less than eighty-two fellow-creatures before the winter was\r\nwell over. Towards spring, however, the supply ran short, and only two\r\nmore remained for him. He had now fasted two entire weeks, and looked\r\nhungry and eager. The keeper offered him a guinea-pig, at which he\r\ntook great offence, spreading his hood and hissing angrily for a long\r\nwhile. Eggs he declined, also a lizard and a rat, in great disgust. In\r\nIndia the Ophiophagi are said to feed on lizards and fish occasionally,\r\nbut _our_ Ophiophagus preferred to fast. At last one of the two ring\r\nsnakes was produced, and Ophio was to be regaled. It was the 31st of\r\nMarch 1876, and he had been a denizen of the Gardens just one year. My\r\nnotebook informs me that it was a lovely, soft spring day, and that\r\nOphio was quite lively. He had rejected frogs on his own account, but\r\nin the uncertainty of more ring snakes arriving, he was now decoyed\r\ninto eating half a dozen. Holland contrived that the snake destined for\r\nhis dinner should answer the purpose of a feast, and had allowed it to\r\neat as many frogs as it chose. Like the poor wretch who, doomed to the\r\ngallows, is permitted to fare sumptuously the last morning of his life,\r\nthe ring snake ate three frogs, by which the Ophiophagus was to derive\r\nchief benefit; he, all unconscious of the cause of his victim’s unusual\r\nplumpness, swallowing him speedily.\r\n\r\nSoon after this Ophio doffed his winter coat entire, and having again\r\nfasted for ten days, was at once rewarded by the last remaining ring\r\nsnake in a similarly plethoric condition, namely, with three more frogs\r\ninside him. Now and then during the winter months the scarcity of\r\nring snakes has compelled the sacrifice of some far rarer colubers to\r\nOphio’s cannibal tastes. And yet each year we hear of hundreds of ring\r\nsnakes being ruthlessly killed in country districts, while at great\r\ncost and trouble others are purchased or brought from the Continent for\r\nthe Hamadryad’s sustenance. Lord Lilford, one of the Ophidarium’s best\r\npatrons, sometimes sends presents of game in the shape of ring snakes\r\nto the Hamadryad.\r\n\r\nWhile watching this snake-eater over his dinner, one is struck with the\r\nremarkable tenacity of life exhibited in the victim, or the slow action\r\nof the venom if poisoned in the first grasp. The Ophiophagus seizes it\r\nanywhere, that is, at whichever part happens to come first, and then,\r\nafter holding it quietly for a time, works his jaws up to the head\r\nin the usual hand-over-hand, or ‘jaw-after-jaw’ fashion, invariably\r\nswallowing the snake head first. On one occasion when I watched\r\nattentively, Ophio, having seized a ring snake by the middle, held it\r\ndoggedly still for one quarter of an hour, while the lesser snake did\r\nits very best to work its way out of the jaws, and also to fetter his\r\ncaptor by twirling itself over his head and coiling round his neck.\r\nThis continued while Ophio, with his head and neck raised, remained\r\nmotionless, and after the quarter of an hour commenced to work his\r\njaws up towards the head of the ring snake, which, as more and more of\r\nits own body was free for action, twirled itself about, and at length\r\ncoiled its tail round the bit of branch nailed into the cage.\r\n\r\nPersistently, like a sailor making his vessel fast to the windlass, the\r\nring snake lashed as much of himself as was free round the branch a\r\nfoot off, and so pulled and pulled till he looked in danger of severing\r\nhimself in two. Meanwhile Ophio, slowly but surely advancing, caused\r\nits head and neck to disappear, grasping tightly with his venomous\r\njaws, as if he would say, ‘We’ll see who is master.’ It was a close\r\ntussle, so firmly did the little coluber retain his hold on the ‘tree;’\r\nbut as the upper part of him was gradually drawn into those unrelaxing\r\njaws, he by degrees gave way, and by and by was gone.\r\n\r\nNot far short of an hour was occupied in this meal, during which the\r\nvictim showed no signs of being poisoned, nor were his coils round the\r\nstump relaxed in the slightest degree, till Ophio reached the tail. The\r\nring snake is not a constrictor, yet he thus tied himself round the\r\ntree by the coils of his tail.\r\n\r\nOne more singular case of tenacity of life must be recorded. A ring\r\nsnake had been caught in the usual way, and the usual struggle ensued\r\nbetween captor and captive. Coluber, with its head tightly gripped in\r\nthe jaws of his enemy, had still all the rest of himself at liberty\r\nand in full activity, and after wriggling a violent protest, he coiled\r\nwhat was left of himself so closely round the neck of his persecutor\r\nthat the latter made little or no progress with his dinner for a time.\r\nHe seemed to be deliberating how to proceed next, and asking, ‘What is\r\nthe meaning of this?’ then shook his head, lowered it to the shingle,\r\nand tried to rub off the coils. The only result thus achieved was that\r\nthe extreme end of coluber’s tail was loosened for a moment, but only\r\nto coil afresh round Ophio’s jaws, which nevertheless slowly and surely\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nFor nearly an hour the progress was very slow; but when the ring snake\r\nwas all swallowed except a few inches of tail, these became so tight a\r\nmuzzle that Ophio in turn was the victim. Shaking his head and vainly\r\nendeavouring to free his jaws of this muzzle, a minute or two elapsed,\r\nduring which he seemed to suffer some discomfort, when suddenly his\r\nmouth opened widely, and out crawled Natrix, apparently none the worse\r\nfor this temporary entombment. He had turned round when two or three\r\nfeet from daylight, and come back to see the world once more. But it so\r\nhappened that Ophio closed his jaws in time over the few inches of tail\r\nwhich still remained between them. Nor did he once relax his grasp of\r\nthis, but quickly and patiently began to work his way up to the head\r\nand recommence his meal, and this time with better success. An hour\r\nand a quarter I watched, nor was any evidence of poison seen, so as to\r\nreduce the powers of the bitten snake for bitten it must have been in\r\nthose prolonged and forcible grasps.\r\n\r\nIn these conflicts one could but observe a dogged stupidity on the part\r\nof the venomous snake, who, had he but brought coils to his aid, might\r\nhave simplified matters so easily. The little Heterodons and even the\r\nLacertines often assist themselves with coils in managing their prey,\r\nthough not themselves constrictors but the venomous ones have not the\r\nslightest notion of helping themselves in this way, as if confident\r\nthat in time their venom would do its work. In self-protection,\r\nhowever, we have seen that a rattlesnake can coil, p.394.\r\n\r\nThis Ophiophagus has caused to vanish, on an average, not far short\r\nof a hundred snakes per annum since his arrival in England, say seven\r\nhundred in all. In his native haunts, actively moving and climbing\r\namidst plenty of other snakes, one might multiply the consumption by\r\nat least three, and give to the Hamadryads the credit of assisting\r\nGovernment in exterminating snakes to the extent of 300 each per annum.\r\nThese snakes, therefore, should be much prized by the Government\r\nsnake-exterminators, and in reward for services rendered, have their\r\nown lives spared. They are not very common, nor very obtrusive; and we\r\ndo not hear of so many deaths laid to their charge as to cobras and\r\nBungari. So long as you do not molest their nests or their young, they\r\nget out of your way; but for all that, they might be turned to very\r\ngood account as snake consumers.\r\n\r\nSo might some in Australia and in South America, and elsewhere; for\r\nalthough this especial Hamadryad usurps the name of ‘Snake-eater,’\r\nthere are Ophiophagi in many parts of the world. They are chiefly\r\n_Elapidæ_. Probably on account of the small head and slender form of\r\nthese snakes, a fellow-creature is more convenient to swallow than an\r\nanimal all joints and elbows, and fur-covered. Many snakes are also\r\ninvoluntarily or rather unintentionally cannibals, as in the case of\r\nthe Tropidonoti, when two seize the same frog, or the python swallowing\r\nGeoptyas (p. 38). In such cases the swallower does not first seize his\r\ncomrade with the intention of devouring him; but both having hold on\r\na meal which neither chooses to relinquish, it is a mere question of\r\nwhich one first reaches the jaws of the other, and which pair of jaws\r\nhappens to be most widely extended. A case is recorded in _Nature_,\r\nMarch 8th, 1877, of a Mr. L. Heiligbrodt in Texas capturing an\r\nunusually thick ‘Water moccasin’ (_Ancistrodon pugnax_), and on opening\r\nit finding a large ‘Copper-head’ (_Ancistrodon contortrix_), recently\r\nswallowed.\r\n\r\nThis was ‘the only case on record,’ for it is very unusual for the\r\n_Crotalidæ_ to eat each other; and very probably, in this instance, the\r\ncause was a mutual meal. ‘Moccasins’ (_Tropidonoti_) at the Gardens\r\nsometimes have such a hard grip on each other as to fetch blood. I\r\nonce saw two of these rearing themselves high in their scuffle for\r\nthe unhappy frog of which both had equal hold. The keeper was obliged\r\nto administer corporeal reproof, which caused one of them to let go,\r\nwhen the other swallowed the frog almost at one gulp, as you might\r\nswallow an oyster. Nor do they invariably turn the frog round to\r\nswallow it head first. This is done if the frog is likely to escape.\r\nThese so-called ‘moccasins’ are of a very pugnacious disposition. One\r\nof them once startled me by dashing at me through the glass, with\r\nsuch violence that I thought the glass would have been broken. I was\r\ndoing nothing whatever to alarm it, and I knew the snakes quite well.\r\nBut in that angry mood its aspect seemed so changed, that I asked the\r\nkeeper if that were a new snake and a venomous one, which it certainly\r\nresembled at the moment. I may here mention that Professor Brown Goode\r\n(who presided over the ‘American Science Convention on Snakes’) once\r\ncaught a _Tropidonotus fasciatus_ in Florida, which was so like the\r\n‘dreaded moccasin’ (_Ancistrodon piscivorus_), that not until he had\r\nexamined the mouth and found it was harmless could he identify it.\r\nThese _Tropidonoti_ have been known to take raw meat occasionally; so\r\nhas the Xenodon, and so has a rattlesnake at the Gardens. Indeed, of\r\none of these the keeper said, ‘It will eat any dead thing;’ and he\r\nfound it convenient sometimes to give it a rat or a guinea-pig which a\r\nneighbouring snake had killed by poisoning, but not eaten. The Crotalus\r\nin such cases imbibed some foreign venom with his dinner. One Crotalus\r\nat the Gardens would eat only rats, others prefer guinea-pigs.\r\n\r\n‘Look at that rat!’ exclaimed a lady to her friend, when the keeper\r\ngave the rattlesnake a good-sized guinea-pig.\r\n\r\n‘I think it must be a rabbit; it is too big for a rat,’ returned the\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nBefore they could decide this zoological question, it lay dead. The\r\nrattlesnake struck it and left it. It gave one gasp, fell over, and\r\nin half a minute was dead. Another day a guinea-pig was six minutes\r\ndying, but on this occasion the rattlesnake had expended some of its\r\nvenom in angrily striking the iron rod with which the keeper was moving\r\nsomething in the cage. When the guinea-pig seemed to be dead, the\r\nCrotalus, after eyeing and smelling it all over, that is, investigating\r\nit with its tongue as if to be assured, was about to take it, when the\r\nlittle animal had one slight spasm more, and the snake darted back its\r\nhead and rapidly retreated. Watching them as I have done for years,\r\nI am still undecided whether excessive timidity or their low order\r\nof intelligence is paramount in the rattlesnakes. They are so slow\r\nand sluggish of movement, that those accustomed to them hold them in\r\ntolerable contempt. I have seen Holland watch his opportunity, open\r\nthe cage, and put his hand in to snatch away a guinea-pig to give to\r\nanother snake if the Crotalus did not want it.\r\n\r\n‘They always coil before striking,’ is often said. They certainly take\r\ntime to think about an attack and to make ready by having plenty of\r\ncoils—slack rope, as it were—at their command, in order to reach\r\ntheir aim, the ‘always coiling’ not truly meaning that they wind\r\nthemselves round and round as a sailor coils a rope, with their head\r\nin the middle. The ‘coiling’ has been thus described by persons with\r\n‘unscientific imaginations;’ but having its head in the centre of such\r\na coil, the snake would _not_ easily reach its object. Often the coils\r\nare like those of ‘Totsey’ when taking her choice of a bird, having\r\nloose folds near the head, which is always _forward_ in readiness for\r\nthe attack.\r\n\r\nExcellent opportunities of observing the relative venoms present\r\nthemselves in zoological collections—not only the degrees of poison\r\nseen in the different serpents, but the effects produced by one serpent\r\nat different times. Of those species when in full vigour there is no\r\ndoubt but that the South American rattlesnake (_Crotalus horridus_) is\r\none of the most virulent. Sometimes this species will strike at a young\r\nrabbit or a guinea-pig, and death is almost instantaneous. One such\r\ninstance was observed when a rattlesnake struck a guinea-pig on the\r\nhead, the little animal falling as if shot, and in such a flash of time\r\nthat Holland examined it to ascertain the cause, and ‘its brains had\r\nturned quite green directly.’\r\n\r\n‘A new rattlesnake’ was introduced in the autumn of 1873. Not new to\r\nscience, but this, I regret to find, is all that my notebook records\r\nin heading some observations made September 26th of that year, ‘a very\r\nwarm day’ for the season. A guinea-pig was put into the cage, when\r\nthe snake (I _think_ it was _Crotalus durissus_) approached its head\r\nclosely and stealthily till quite near to the little animal, shrinking\r\nback at the slightest movement on the part of the guinea-pig, which sat\r\nstaring and blinking in a corner. Each time the snake recoiled, even\r\nat a blink, it kept its eyes fixed in alarm on the piggy, who stupidly\r\nreturned the gaze, not knowing what to make of the snake or of the\r\npeople so close to him. By and by the snake, regaining courage, again\r\nventured nearer, and again when nearly close started back at a slight\r\nmovement of the guinea-pig. Three times a similar approach was made\r\nbefore the snake ventured to strike, betraying its extreme caution and\r\ntimidity. As soon as struck, the guinea-pig was convulsed, and falling\r\non its side was dead in three minutes.\r\n\r\nRats do not succumb to the poison nearly so quickly as rabbits,\r\nguinea-pigs, and birds.\r\n\r\nAnother guinea-pig struck by a rattlesnake immediately fell over on its\r\nside, and died, panting hard, in _about_ three minutes. One could not\r\ndiscern the precise moment of its last gasp; but in this case there\r\nwere no convulsive jerkings of the limbs.\r\n\r\nThe rattlesnakes always strike and then recede quickly, keeping a\r\nstealthy watch over their prey until it is perfectly still, often\r\nmuch longer. Puff adders and some others of the African vipers,\r\non the contrary, retain their hold after biting. Cobras sometimes\r\nstrike and retain their hold, and sometimes let the prey go and wait\r\nfor it to die. On a small creature the effect of Puff-adder venom\r\nis instantaneous; and a remarkable difference is observable between\r\nthe effect on a timid victim and on a rat. One of these adders ate a\r\nsparrow alive August 20, 1874, that is, struck and held it, swallowing\r\nit so quickly that it had not time to die. A sparrow is, however, a\r\nvery small prey for so large a serpent. Another Puff adder, about to\r\ncast its coat, bit a guinea-pig, which was rapidly convulsed, as with\r\nspasms, accompanied by sharp jerkings of the limbs for nearly five\r\nminutes, when it became motionless. In this case the charge of venom\r\nmight be feeble. In September of that year a Puff adder (I think the\r\nsame as the last named) bit a rat, which at first ran about trying\r\nto escape, going close to the viper, as if unconscious of an enemy,\r\nand apparently unharmed during the first minute. Then it became aware\r\nof pain, and began to lash its tail, whisking it round and round in\r\na frantic manner. Then one of its hind legs kicked out, probably the\r\nbitten limb, jerking violently for a time, and the rat lay helpless\r\nthus for about two minutes. In four minutes from the bite it gasped,\r\nand continued to gasp harder and harder for nearly three minutes more.\r\nIt then bled at the mouth. The Puff adder then bit it again, when,\r\nafter two or three more minutes, it leaped violently in convulsions\r\nfrom the effect of the second bite. The convulsions became gradually\r\nless; but fully twenty minutes elapsed, in spite of a double charge of\r\nvenom, before the rat was dead. In all similar cases I noticed that\r\nrats were very tenacious of life. A guinea-pig has been killed in five\r\nseconds from the bite of a Puff adder.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, a ‘nose-horned viper’ (_Vipera nasicornis_) struck a\r\nrabbit, which immediately ran and started spasmodically, panting as if\r\nastonished and wondering what had hurt him. Then he leaped into the\r\nwell at the back of the cage, but in that short moment was too feeble\r\nto crawl back again. He attempted to run, but sank quickly. Being out\r\nof sight, it was impossible to state the exact moment in which it died,\r\nbut the whole was in less than two minutes. These vipers are no doubt\r\nintensely virulent. Another day one of them with a bad swelled face\r\nfrom abscess bit a guinea-pig, which in thirty seconds fell over on its\r\nside. It squeaked convulsively the moment it was bitten, and several\r\ntimes afterwards. It lay motionless for half a minute, appearing to be\r\ndead, but gave one slight start afterwards, and was perfectly still\r\nbefore three minutes expired.\r\n\r\nIn stating these periods of time decisively, it is by the watch. When I\r\ndid not keep my watch in hand, I do not state the time so positively.\r\n\r\nBetween those larger African vipers, when all are in full vigour, there\r\nwould appear to be not much difference in power of bite. A ‘River Jack’\r\n(_Vipera rhinoceros_) struck a guinea-pig, holding it in his mouth till\r\ndead, which was in less than two minutes. Poor little piggy struggled\r\nconvulsively the first few moments as if in pain; then only gasped as\r\nif labouring to breathe, but soon was insensible.\r\n\r\nThe poison of _Cenchris piscivorus_, though a much slighter snake,\r\nseems as potent as that of the rattlesnake. One of these struck\r\na guinea-pig—the action being so swift that some of us who were\r\nattentively observing were not sure that the animal had been bitten\r\nat all, except from the instantaneous effects, the guinea-pig leaping\r\nfrantically and dashing itself about for a few seconds; then it sank\r\ngasping heavily, and kicking convulsively, until in a few minutes\r\nlife was extinct. Some of the creatures live ten minutes, others not\r\nten seconds. I was glad to observe that in most cases insensibility\r\nrapidly overcame them. And without exception, it was observable that\r\nof the two—the snake or the destined food—the first named was by far\r\nthe most alarmed, or ‘charmed.’ In the actions of the little creatures\r\nthrown into the cages, there was a fearless, unsuspicious freedom, when\r\nonce they had recovered the surprise of finding themselves suddenly\r\nthere instead of in a dark box. Rabbits hop about and over the snakes,\r\nand then sit up and clean themselves. Birds plume themselves and look\r\nabout to see what they can pick up, perching upon the snake as if it\r\nwere a log of wood. Rats run hither and thither to find something to\r\neat, and then wash _their_ faces. Many of the little animals run over\r\nthe snakes, quite unconscious of their being live enemies, or force\r\ntheir noses under them, to the evident alarm and discomfort of the\r\nOphidian, should he be disinclined to move. Sometimes, if faint and\r\nlanguid, and huddled together in a corner, it is because they—the\r\nvictims—are oppressed with the closeness of the cage and the vitiated\r\nair, but quite apart from any ‘spell’ or magnetic influence. They may\r\nstare at the serpent that is staring at them, and as they stare in\r\nalarm at the people, but they have never seen a python, a puff adder,\r\nor a rattlesnake before in their lives, and have not the slightest idea\r\nthat they are going to be eaten by one. And for this reason you so\r\noften see the startled and surprised look the moment of being struck.\r\nThus far they have been unconscious of danger; and when a shock does\r\ncome, it is incomprehensible, because instinct does not guide them\r\nunder the circumstances.\r\n\r\nOn account of the excessive timidity of cobras, it is seldom that they\r\ncan be observed when feeding, which is frequently in the night, or\r\n‘when no one is looking,’ to repeat the keeper’s words; but the little\r\nIndian viper (_Echis carinata_) should not be omitted in these notes,\r\nbecause there is difference of opinion regarding its virulence. Being\r\none of the smallest vipers, only from sixteen to eighteen inches in\r\nlength, one would argue extraordinary power from effects seen. A friend\r\nwho had resided in India expressed great astonishment on hearing it\r\nsaid that a cobra was supposed to be more deadly than this one, known\r\nas the ‘carpet viper’ or the ‘whip snake,’ which, he said, could kill\r\na man in a half-hour, and that he had seen men thus die. ‘If a cobra\r\nbite you, you have at least four or five hours to live,’ he said;\r\n‘but half an hour for the whip snake, and you are a dead man.’ The\r\nindividual brought to the Gardens in 1875 died the day after it gave\r\nbirth to three young ones. While alive it ate nothing, and, as it was\r\nthen thought, because it had not its natural food, Dr. Günther having\r\ndiscovered nothing but _scolopendræ_ in the specimens which he had\r\nexamined. Now it would be interesting to discover whether, as Aristotle\r\naffirmed, the bites of all venomous animals are more pernicious if\r\nthey have devoured each other, or if snakes have devoured scorpions,\r\nand whether the toxic powers of the little Echis are aggravated by the\r\nvenomous food it evidently prefers at home. ‘In India is a certain\r\nlittle serpent for the bite of which alone the natives have no remedy,’\r\nsaid Aristotle; and one can scarcely err in deciding this to be the\r\nEchis, being not only the smallest venomous snake there, but the only\r\nviper, except Russell’s viper, a much larger snake.\r\n\r\nOnly twice could I observe the toxic effects of the _Echis carinata_ at\r\npresent (1882) in the collection; both cases being in hot weather. It\r\nhas so far conformed to circumstances in England, as to consent to dine\r\non small white mice, failing scorpions. In the first case it struck\r\nthe mouse savagely as soon as it was dropped into the cage, and the\r\nmouse died in less than two minutes. Echis approached it stealthily\r\nand timidly, but having at last got courage to seize it, ate it very\r\nquickly; and as the snake moved and dragged it, the mouse appeared\r\nto be quite stiff in that short time. On the second occasion, it bit\r\na mouse on the leg, and it was five minutes dying. At first only the\r\nleg was paralyzed; then a spasm followed, and the mouse fell over and\r\nlay extended flat and still as if dead; but presently a spasmodic\r\nconvulsion followed. It again appeared to be dead, and the little viper\r\napproached; but on a very slight spasm receded swiftly, not once taking\r\nits eyes off the mouse, which was dying slowly. The viper was at least\r\nfive minutes swallowing this, and as if it did not much care about it.\r\nOne must argue, therefore, that the charge of venom had been scantily\r\nexpended, as the difference between this and the previous victim was\r\nremarkable. Echis poison has been seen to take instantaneous effect.\r\nThe small _Vipera atropos_ from the South African mountains is also\r\nastoundingly virulent. One in the collection in 1881 struck a mouse as\r\nsoon as it arrived, and death occurred in fifty seconds by the watch.\r\nA large store of poison must have accumulated during its journey and\r\nsince its previous meal.\r\n\r\nOne more African snake must be mentioned before I conclude the painful\r\nduty of describing the inevitable—though happily short—sufferings\r\ninflicted by venomous serpents.\r\n\r\nThree young _Najas_, the well-known _Ring Halsschlange_ of South\r\nAfrica, were brought in the spring of, I think, 1877. They were very\r\nblack and very shy, and for a long while one could see nothing more\r\nof them than three little heads in a row peeping out from under\r\ntheir blanket, and watching with their large round black eyes, but\r\nvanishing like a shot at your approach. ‘They cut away the moment you\r\ngo near them,’ said the keeper. When they did give us an opportunity\r\nof looking at them, we found that one was quite black, and another\r\nwas speckled with white; they erected their heads and distended their\r\nnecks defiantly. Their eyes had a white rim round them, and were bright\r\nand undeniably beautiful, even though belonging to a venomous snake.\r\nWhether because they were young and inexperienced, or naturally stupid,\r\nI could not decide but of all the snakes none ever went so awkwardly\r\nto work in feeding, or put their victims to such unnecessary torture,\r\nas did these ridiculous little _Najas_. The feeding observations were\r\nmade in August, when they had grown considerably, and had become\r\naccustomed to their home. They seemed to bite the prey anywhere without\r\nmuch effect, sometimes retaining it in their mouth, and at other times\r\nbeginning at once to eat it. One frog was ten minutes from the time\r\nit was struck until it was swallowed, and for no reason beyond the\r\nfeeder’s awkwardness. The little snake began at a hind leg, and not\r\nbeing able to get the frog into its mouth, put it down and began again\r\nat the side, but with no better result, the legs being in the way. Then\r\nhe gave it up and let the frog go, and presently his comrade struck\r\nthe half-dead thing and took five minutes to eat it. One might decide\r\nfrom this that frogs were not their natural food; but with very young\r\nsparrows the same mismanagement was observable. The bird was awkwardly\r\nbitten on the tip of the wing, and the snake held it helplessly for\r\na quarter of an hour while the bird was struggling violently. Not\r\ngetting good hold, the snake put it down and began again, so that the\r\npoor little sparrow was twenty minutes in being swallowed, gasping to\r\nthe last, and evidently only very feebly poisoned. One of the Najas bit\r\nhis companion, and held on for about ten minutes, and for no reason\r\nwhatever that one could discern. In no other venomous snakes have I\r\nseen such prolonged suffering caused by such stupidity or bungling\r\nas in those young African ‘Ring Hals.’ Their fangs are, however,\r\nexceedingly short, as I found on examining a dead one, and this may\r\naccount for the slow effect of them.\r\n\r\nThree other heads were often seen in a row peeping out, but belonging\r\nto harmless ‘glass snakes,’ and there was intelligence in their looks;\r\nfor they recognised the keeper, and advanced to the glass whenever he\r\npassed, asking for their dinner as plainly as little snakes could ask.\r\nA _Heterodon_ exhibited equal intelligence when it was dinner-time,\r\nand sprang at the glass when he saw the keeper coming. Some of the\r\npythons display intelligence too, on feeding days, but of quite an\r\nepicure form. One day in May 1876, on remarking that the pythons were\r\ndisinclined to eat, Holland said ‘they were waiting for young ducks,’\r\nonly elderly birds being in their cage at the time. Even in summer they\r\ndon’t eat the old ducks so eagerly, because the large, hard quills\r\nannoy them. A bunch of these quills passes undigested. Hair or feathers\r\nin a desiccated mass pass through the snakes, and occasionally, when\r\nthey are not in health, digestible but undigested substances too, also\r\nthe beaks of the ducks.\r\n\r\nVegetable substances have been found in snakes, from which it has been\r\nargued that they sometimes eat vegetables. But it rather argues that\r\nthey don’t digest vegetables, which have probably been swallowed in the\r\nstomach of a rabbit or some other herbivorous animal that they have\r\ncaught.\r\n\r\nAn indifference to food was noticeable in the snakes in ungenial\r\nweather. One cold, raw, foggy day in October 1873, a python caught\r\na duck and partially coiled it, but so feebly that the bird, after\r\npassively submitting for a time, at last disengaged her feet and walked\r\naway to shake herself, and then turn and stare as if to discover what\r\npossibly had kept her there.\r\n\r\nA similar disinclination to exert themselves was seen that same chilly\r\nday in the largest cage, where were three large pythons. One of them\r\nhaving killed a duck, could not get a satisfactory hold of its head,\r\nand let go repeatedly. Another held a duck, but not to crush it or\r\nhurt it; for it, like the one above named, only gazed deliberately\r\naround, and as if asking the meaning of its detention. A third duck\r\nwas put into the den for the third python, who, however, only lazily\r\nstared at it and made no attempt to seize it; while the bird gazed in\r\nastonishment at the one in the embrace of the other snake, as if to\r\ninquire, ‘What are you doing there?’ Presently this duck also got away,\r\nand was again caught and only partially coiled. The python seemed too\r\nlarge and fat to constrict so small a thing as a duck. It was like\r\ntying up a pill-box with a rope. Some of the spectators expressed\r\nsatisfaction that the duck was not more tightly coiled, and hoped it\r\nwould succeed in getting away (the duck was not worth two shillings,\r\nthe python could not be bought for twenty pounds), and were far more\r\nhorrified when a vigorous constrictor caught and killed its prey in\r\none flash, as when an extended watch-spring flies back to its original\r\nposition. But a half-constricted creature does suffer, and happily\r\nthis does not often occur, the chilly weather that day diminishing\r\nophidian energy considerably. A gentleman, disappointed because they\r\ndid not eat, and wishing to assign some reason for such unaccountable\r\nabstinence, remarked to his friend, ‘I have an idea they sting\r\nthemselves.’\r\n\r\nWatching these gigantic ophidians on one of those half-wintry days,\r\nit happened that two of them were lazily gliding, partially hidden by\r\ntheir blanket, and with neither heads nor tails visible, so that the\r\ntwo bodies seemed as only one snake. Two youths stood watching and\r\nvainly endeavouring to calculate the numbers of feet or of yards which\r\nwere entwined and entwisted in those moving coils. Portions and loops\r\nof two other pythons in the same cage were visible beyond the rug, but\r\nonly one head of all the four snakes was to be seen; and to distinguish\r\nto which of the gliding, shining curves that head belonged, was\r\nimpossible. ‘It seems to me that snake’s such a length that he doesn’t\r\nknow the other part belongs to him,’ remarked one boy to his friend.\r\n\r\n‘I don’t think he knows where it is,’ returned the other boy\r\nsympathetically.\r\n\r\nNot a little are the keepers sometimes tried in replying to the\r\ninquiries of visitors desirous of improving their minds. Let me repeat\r\none or two conversations overheard on those Fridays.\r\n\r\n‘Is that duck put in there for the snake to eat?’ asked a respectably\r\ndressed man of the keeper on one of those autumnal days, when a duck\r\nsat pluming itself as if settling itself for the evening.\r\n\r\n‘Yes, sir,’ replied the keeper.\r\n\r\n‘Will he swallow it whole?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, sir.’\r\n\r\n‘Choke him! I should think?’\r\n\r\n‘No, sir; no—it won’t choke him.’\r\n\r\nThe man studied the duck, and studied the size of the python’s head\r\nand throat for some time. The duck apparently going to rest, but not\r\nquite reconciled at so many persons intruding upon her, the man looked\r\ndisappointed, and again began:\r\n\r\n‘Now is that duck charmed, sitting there?’\r\n\r\n‘I should think, sir, she was not at all charmed with the prospect,’\r\nsedately replied Holland.\r\n\r\n‘Does that duck _know_ it’s going to be eaten?’ then inquired the man\r\nafter fresh scrutiny.\r\n\r\n‘No, sir,’ returned the keeper with the utmost gravity.\r\n\r\n‘That snake don’t seem to be hungry,’ then said the disappointed\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\n‘No, sir. He’ll eat well enough next Friday. He’s going to change his\r\nskin.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh!’ said the man to a boy by his side, satisfied, though still rather\r\npuzzled, ‘that snake’s going to change his skin next Friday.’\r\n\r\nThough there are always on an average fifty snakes in the Reptile\r\nHouse, and on an average each casts its coat three times a year, the\r\nvisitors are for the most part much mystified about this phenomenon.\r\nA snake that had just completed a new toilet had a portion of the old\r\nslough still adhering to its tail, when a boy drew attention to it,\r\nsaying, ‘Papa, that snake is all ragged and torn on its tail.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, my dear, it is casting its tail.’ Papa must have been reading\r\nAristotle, who wrote: ‘Tails, also, of serpents and lizards when cut\r\noff are reproduced.’ With regard to the reproduction of their eyes,\r\nAristotle spake more cautiously. ‘It is reported that the eyes of\r\nserpents, if dug out, will be reproduced.’ But, on the contrary, the\r\neyes of snakes are easily injured, and _not_ easily healed; snakes are\r\ntherefore frequently seen partially blind. As need scarcely be said,\r\nonly lizards ‘reproduce’ a tail that has been accidentally abridged;\r\nand the repair is after all only a boneless one. The truncated member\r\ngradually heals, and by and by a short point is again formed, but can\r\nalways be recognised as a repaired, and not the original, tail; and\r\nas far as I have been able to observe, viz. for three or four months,\r\nno bone was reproduced. Probably also a snake’s tail might heal in\r\nthe same way, and to a casual observer appear quite perfect; but the\r\nanatomical structure in either case would not, I imagine, be restored.\r\n\r\nThat boy was not far wrong when he said he thought the python did not\r\nknow which was its own tail. At all events, it is not endowed with much\r\nexternal sensation, as one might judge by the way in which the rats and\r\nguinea-pigs take liberties with it. This must be owing to the thickness\r\nof the cuticle, because, as we have seen in the constricting snakes,\r\nthere is keen muscular sensibility in the tail. I may cite an instance\r\nof each case. One day a young rabbit caught hold of a small python\r\nwith its teeth and held firmly on. The reptile was moving across the\r\ncage, and did not appear to feel any hindrance. Indeed, being much the\r\nstronger of the two, the persistent bunny was compelled to hop along at\r\nthe same pace, still holding on by its teeth. But presently, from the\r\nposition of the snake, the rabbit was obliged to let go, when it next\r\ncaught hold of the tip of the python’s tail, and again holding tight,\r\nhopped after the retreating reptile as if enjoying the joke. In this\r\ncase I do not think the snake was conscious of the insult, as perhaps\r\nthe rabbit had hold of the skin only.\r\n\r\nOn the other occasion a guinea-pig was biting a coiled and passive\r\nconstrictor, _Python sebœ_. The snake wished to be quiet, but piggy\r\ngot among its coils and worried it, hopping over it and biting its\r\ntail. The python on this, moving only the end of its tail, pushed away\r\nthe guinea-pig, which soon returned to the attack. The snake again\r\ngave the little animal a caudal hint that his fidgeting was annoying;\r\nbut as the guinea-pig did not take the hint, and still nibbled and\r\nteased the snake, the latter with two coils of the tail put an end\r\nto the annoyance, not once turning its head, but just tucking up its\r\npersecutor in the end of its tail as you might tuck up a parcel under\r\nyour arm. The python was not hungry, and took no more notice of the\r\noffender, though thus effectually punishing the offence with the last\r\ntwo feet of its practical tail. Could we suppose such a quality as\r\nmuscular intelligence, we might think the tails of those constricting\r\nsnakes were surely endowed with it. As in other instances already\r\ndescribed in chaps. xi. and xii., the eyes took no part in directing\r\nthe movements of the snake; the whole nine or ten feet of the animal\r\nremaining passively coiled, while only the extremity of the tail\r\nexerted itself. When reptiles are in a partially torpid condition,\r\ntheir sensations are slow; when hibernating, they are reduced to a\r\nminimum. At such times, the creatures being half dead, they may be\r\nmaimed or injured without any apparent effect. Rats have been known to\r\nattack and nibble snakes under these circumstances, and even to eat\r\nbits out of them, the snakes being at the time unconscious of injury,\r\nthough possibly dying from the after effects.\r\n\r\nA good deal of very interesting matter might be added on the economics\r\nof the reptilian _ménage_, the mode of ventilating and warming it, the\r\ncost of its larder, and the best means of preserving the health of the\r\ninmates. There are, besides, some incidental experiences not devoid\r\nof sensationalism in connection with snake guardianship, but my own\r\nherpetological experience does not extend beyond the keeping of pet\r\nlizards, including blindworms. I may add a word, however, in reply to\r\nsome often-heard lamentations of disappointed spectators who object to\r\nthe coverlets, after sometimes waiting in vain to see the snakes emerge\r\nfrom beneath them.\r\n\r\n‘Those horrid blankets! Why not give the snakes moss or hay in their\r\ncages? or turf and sand and dead leaves? Much more natural for them\r\nthan those woollen rugs.’\r\n\r\nI, too, may have echoed such plaints until a better comprehension of\r\nophidian nature showed the wisdom of what is certainly a somewhat\r\ndisappointing arrangement. And those who have honoured these pages\r\nwith a patient perusal, and discovered the nervous timidity and\r\nsensitiveness of these reptiles, their proneness to reject or to\r\ndisgorge their food, to injure themselves or each other when molested,\r\nnot to mention the danger of meddling with the venomous kinds and\r\nthe easy escape of the swifter snakes, will admit the importance of\r\nproviding them with such retreat and shelter as can be most speedily\r\narranged, and which will secure the least annoyance to the terrified\r\nserpents while the keepers are doing their best to preserve order and\r\ncleanliness.\r\n\r\nThe allusion to lizards tempts me to add a word or two on the\r\nexceptional species which has lately become an inmate of our Zoological\r\nGardens. There are certain features in it so much in common with\r\nviperine snakes, that I may be pardoned for dragging a lizard into\r\nthese pages. I allude to the Heloderm (_Heloderma horridum_) from\r\nMexico, presented to the Zoological Society in July 1882 by Sir John\r\nLubbock. Its advent was an event in reptilian annals; and being\r\nsurrounded by a halo of curiosity, it claims a passing notice. We have\r\nbeen at some pains to exonerate saurians from the evil character which\r\nour ancestors were apt to give them; but suddenly—and to the surprise\r\nof even some herpetological authorities—there comes a lizard that with\r\none grip of his jaws caused a frog to fall dead in a moment, and a\r\nguinea-pig in three minutes, the symptoms appearing to be the same as\r\nthose produced by deadly snakes. The Heloderm is ‘said’ to be furnished\r\nwith poison glands in both jaws! But until a dead specimen has been\r\nfurther examined and described, the signification of ‘poison gland’\r\nmust be restricted. Its teeth—many and strong—are grooved with a deep\r\nfurrow; its salivary glands are largely developed; and under excitement\r\na thick, acrid secretion flows abundantly from its jaws. Yet so far as\r\npresent observations enable us to form an opinion, the reptile does\r\nnot use these formidable teeth to secure its prey, or even in feeding.\r\nIt did not devour the victims of its bite, nor has it since killed any\r\ncreature for the express purpose of eating it. Up to the date at which\r\nI write (Oct. 1882), eggs have formed its chief diet, varied by an\r\noccasional dead mouse. Now it certainly does not require deeply-grooved\r\nteeth and venomous saliva to bite raw eggs and dead mice. Nor does\r\nthe noxious secretion flow continuously from its gums in repose, but\r\nabundantly so when irritated.\r\n\r\nThough a stranger in England, this lizard was known more than two\r\nhundred years ago. Hernandez, in his _Nova Animalium Mexicanum_,\r\npublished at Rome in 1651, described its bite as ‘hurtful, but not\r\ndeadly;’ and that it was ‘more dreadful in appearance than reality.’\r\nIts Mexican name, _Acaltetepon_, is (or was then) applied to all large\r\nand suspicious-looking lizards. _Scorpione_ is its modern name. As\r\n_Heloderma horridum_ was awarded plenty of space in the journals at\r\nthe time of its arrival, full accounts of it will be found elsewhere;\r\nit is introduced here merely as one of the venomous reptiles that form\r\nthe chief subjects of this chapter, and to trace its analogy with them.\r\nIn its slow, stealthy movements there is the same striking contrast\r\nbetween the Heloderm and most other lizards, that there is between the\r\ndeadly vipers and the active colubrine snakes; and the inquiry suggests\r\nitself, Can the venom elaborated in their system so act upon themselves\r\nas to produce this habitual lethargy? Drowsiness and coma are almost\r\ninvariable effects of snake venom in the blood, and why is it that the\r\ndeadly serpents are so constitutionally different from others? The\r\nHeloderm has a round, heavy tail, of no service to it in swimming,\r\nand short, weak fingers, ill suited to climbing; and it passes its\r\nlethargic existence on the sandy plains of Mexico, manifesting in its\r\nactions, or rather in its inactivity and stealthiness, a conscious\r\ntimidity and cowardice. Motionless for hours, with an impulse to\r\nretreat if molested, but attempting to bite if angered, its noxious\r\nsaliva would seem to be rather protective than aggressive. It may have\r\nformidable enemies at home; and by all we see of it here, it does not\r\nuse its teeth as a means of obtaining food. In this respect, therefore,\r\nit is an exception to deadly serpents, and cannot take its venom into\r\nits stomach as they do. And, again, the remarkable development of its\r\ntongue suggests a peculiarity of food. In lapping the egg, the action\r\nof it is apparently perfected by practice; the tongue is twisted,\r\nextended, twined under, then over, now used as a shovel, a scoop, or a\r\nbroom, as occasion requires. It is the very reverse of what I noticed\r\nin some other lizards feebly lapping up an egg (see p. 71), for in a\r\nmost expeditious manner does Heloderm cause its raw eggs to disappear.\r\n\r\nA word _à propos_ of its name _horridum_, supposed by many to refer\r\nto its objectionable qualities. Unfortunately the word ‘horrid’ has\r\nalmost entirely lost its original signification and become mere slang\r\nin English. But when Wiegmann assigned it the name of _Heloderma\r\nhorridum_ in 1829, ‘horrid’ was understood according to its original\r\nmeaning, from _horridus_, rough, rugged, etc.; and as this reptile has\r\na remarkable skin, dotted over with little prominences, like knobs\r\nor warts (hence its generic name, _Heloderma_, warty skin), there\r\ncan be but little doubt as to the intention of _horridum_. In a\r\ncommunication to _Knowledge_ (Sept. 29), I ventured to call this the\r\n‘Warty-skinned Lizard,’ in consequence of the confused accounts of it\r\nwhich have appeared in print. There are several other warty-skinned or\r\n‘tuberculous lizards.’ The specific _horridus_, as applied to the South\r\nAmerican Crotalus, also signified its terrible or dreadful character,\r\nand not the ‘horrid’ which spectators apply indiscriminately to snakes\r\nand their blankets.\r\n\r\nWith the rapid advance of ophiology comes the splendid new home for\r\nsnakes which will shortly grace our Zoological Gardens; and in taking\r\nleave of my readers, I cannot offer them a kinder wish than that their\r\nvisits there to _observe_ the snakes will be productive to them of as\r\nmuch pleasure as has been mine to describe them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS.\r\n\r\n Am., American;

Nor can the\r\nspectator form any idea of their swimming capacities, their dark,\r\nnarrow tank barely enabling them to extend themselves full length.\r\nHerpetologists differ in assigning the above name, and in deciding\r\nwhich is really the ‘Thorn-tail’ or ‘Horn snake’ of Lawson and Catesby.\r\nThose at the Zoological Gardens, notwithstanding their specific name,\r\nare never regaled on fish.\r\n\r\n[54] _Reptiles of British India._\r\n\r\n[55] Dr. A. Stradling affirms that these two snakes do not invariably\r\nmolest each other. He had the Rat-tail (_Fer de lance_) and two\r\n_Cribos_ with others in one cage, living on peaceful terms.\r\n\r\n[56] _Erpélogie générale_, tome i. p. 47.\r\n\r\n[57] _Essai sur la physiognomie des serpents_, par Herman Schlegel.\r\nAmsterdam, 1837.\r\n\r\n[58] _Curiosities of Natural History_, by F. Buckland.\r\n\r\n[59] _Anatomy of the Vertebrates_, p. 260.\r\n\r\n[60] Since the above was in type, I have on several occasions observed\r\nvertical coils in constricting snakes. Twice a python constricted an\r\nanimal in _distinct vertical coils_. I drew the attention of Keeper\r\nTyrrell to this, and we were both convinced that no lateral coils\r\nwhatever were used. On another occasion, while Mr. Elwes was studying\r\nthe action of _Elaphis quater-radiatus_ for the illustration, p. 205,\r\nits coils were entirely vertical, _not_ lateral.\r\n\r\n[61] _A Naturalist in Jamaica_, by P. H. Gosse.\r\n\r\n[62] _Pseudoxia_, Book iii. chap. xx. p. 155.\r\n\r\n[63] Since this was in type, I find that not even a porcupine is safe\r\nfrom a hungry snake. In vol. xliii. of the _Philosophical Transactions_\r\n(1744), p. 271, is a letter from a gentleman in India, who states that\r\non an island near Bombay a dead snake was found with the quills of a\r\nporcupine ‘sticking out of its Belly.’ The snake had ‘sucked it in Head\r\nforemost, while the Quills were flatted down. Afterwards they rose and\r\nran through the Snake’s Belly, and so killed it.’ The pressure of the\r\njaws had ‘flatted’ the quills, but not killed the animal, which, when\r\nin its expansile tomb, had, though vainly, erected its natural armour.\r\n\r\n[64] Owen’s _Anatomy of the Vertebrates_, p. 261.\r\n\r\n[65] _Genius of Christianity._\r\n\r\n[66] _Anatomy of the Vertebrates_, vol. iii. p. 260 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[67] _Organization of the Animal Kingdom._\r\n\r\n[68] _Essay on the Physiology of Serpents._ Translated from the\r\noriginal by Thomas Stewart Trail, M.D., F.R.S.E., etc. Edin. 1843.\r\n\r\n[69] ‘On the Movements of Snakes in Flight,’ by Dr. Arthur Stradling,\r\nC.M.Z.S., _Nature_, Feb. 1882.\r\n\r\n[70] Letter to Sir Emerson Tennant.\r\n\r\n[71] Dumeril et Bibron, _Erpétologie générale_, tome i. p. 179.\r\n\r\n[72] Since this has been in type, there has been brought to the Gardens\r\nan Indian ‘River snake’ (_Tropidonotus quincunciatus_), affording me\r\nan opportunity to observe that there is a notable modification of the\r\nglottis, as also of the nostrils. Not a true water snake, but one of\r\nthe intermediate families, so do we find the nostrils somewhat higher\r\nthan those of land snakes, while yet not quite on the top of the snout\r\nas in sea snakes; the glottis has a corresponding upward direction\r\nto meet them, and is a more elongated, longitudinal slit than those\r\nfurnished with the _petite languette_.—June 1882.\r\n\r\n[73] _Prairie Farms and Prairie Folk_, vol. ii. pp. 83, 84.\r\n\r\n[74] See _Field_ newspaper, June 25, 1881.\r\n\r\n[75] _Thanatophidia of India_, 1st ed.\r\n\r\n[76] _Origin of Species_, 6th ed. 1872, p. 83.\r\n\r\n[77] See _Philosophical Transactions_, London, 1672.\r\n\r\n[78] _New Experiments upon Vipers, with Exquisite Remedies that may\r\nbe drawn from them: as well as Cure for their Bitings, as for that of\r\nother Maladies._ By M.

A remarkable proof of her care for them\r\nwas seen in her trying to bite when disturbed. He had never before\r\nknown _Coluber natrix_ to display this anger. In the _Zoologist_ of\r\nSeptember 1882, the Doctor contributed a long and important account of\r\nthis incubation with its attendant features.\r\n\r\n[131] ‘Wrongly named; or, Poor Little Lizzie,’ by Catherine C.
