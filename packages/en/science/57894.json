Here is a very simple experiment that will\r\nprove this truth to anyone.\r\n\r\nPile up ten draughtsmen, as shown in Fig. 1. Before this pile place\r\nanother piece on edge, and pressing its circumference with the\r\nforefinger, let it glide from underneath so that it strikes the pile\r\nwith considerable force. The piece so thrown must, you will think,\r\nupset the whole pile of draughts; but no: the piece thus sharply sent\r\nforward will strike only one piece of the pile, and this alone will be\r\ndislodged without putting the others out of their equilibrium, and the\r\nwhole column above will settle down together on the bottom piece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nIn effect, the force of the impulse, making itself felt on the piece\r\nthat is touched, the latter leaves the pile without transmitting its\r\nmovement to the other pieces, which, following another physical law,\r\nthat of gravity, descend vertically to fill the place left vacant.\r\n\r\nThe experiment may be varied by using a knife and striking with it a\r\nsharp horizontal blow on one of the pieces. The piece struck will fall\r\nout of the pile without disturbing the symmetry of the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Decanter, Card, and Coin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis law of “Inertia” will provide us with a few more experiments as\r\ncurious as they are conclusive.\r\n\r\nPlace a playing or an ordinary visiting card on a decanter; upon the\r\ncard and just in the center, over the aperture of the decanter, put a\r\nsmall coin (a dime). Now, if with a sharp fillip, given horizontally\r\non the edge of the card, you succeed in whisking it off (which is\r\nvery easy), the coin will fall to the bottom of the decanter. The\r\nfollowing phenomenon has taken place: the movement was too rapid to be\r\ntransmitted to the coin, and the card alone was whisked off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe coin being no longer sustained by the card falls, of course,\r\nvertically, without having in the least come out of position.\r\n\r\nA sharp horizontal knock given with a penholder or small stick on the\r\nedge of the card, will produce the same result, but the fillip is more\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Clever Blow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a thin stick about a yard long, and thrust a pin firmly in each of\r\nits extremities. This done, place the stick on the bowls of two pipes,\r\nwhich a couple of persons hold by the stems, in such a manner that the\r\npins only rest on the pipes. A third person then strikes the stick\r\nsharply in the middle, and it will break without injuring the pipes.\r\n\r\nOrdinary clay pipes will do very well, as the more brittle the pipes\r\nare, the more striking is the experiment. How is this explained?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe mechanical effect of the shock has not time to reach the bowls of\r\nthe pipes (inertia), and is only manifested at the very point on which\r\nthe blow falls, hence the stick unable to resist the force of the blow\r\nat the one point breaks in two pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Obedient Coin.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake an ordinary wooden matchbox, and remove the drawer holding the\r\nmatches. In the center place a small coin, a cent will be the best for\r\nthe experiment, the object of which is to make the coin fall into the\r\ninterior without touching it. Tap lightly on that side of the box to\r\nwhich you desire the coin to come, until it rests upon the edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen slightly raise the end of the box whereon the coin rests, and\r\nlightly tap with the finger once more. At once the coin will fall into\r\nthe box. The secret of the experiment is this: the taps on the box only\r\nmove the box, while the coin retains its position by reason of its own\r\ninertia, until the edge of the box reaches it. The last tap knocks\r\naway the support, and the coin, obedient to the law of gravity, falls\r\nvertically into the interior of the box. This little experiment is\r\neasily performed, and extremely interesting when done neatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Cut a String With Your Hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a little practice, and some briskness of movement, you may be able\r\nto break a string of considerable thickness by proceeding as follows:\r\n\r\nWind the string round your left hand, so as to make a loop, as shown in\r\nthe figure. Pass it three or four times round the fingers to insure the\r\nsolidity of the loop. Seize firmly the other end of the string with\r\nyour right hand, around which you wind it three or four times, then\r\ngive a brisk pull. The string will be clean cut at the junction of the\r\nloop in the left hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the knack is well acquired, one may break the string on two\r\nfingers only, by following always the same theory as above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rebound.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the neck of a bottle place a cork in an upright position. The cork\r\nmust be large enough to rest on the neck without falling in.\r\n\r\nNow give a sharp fillip on the neck of the bottle, and you will see the\r\ncork fall, not on the other side of the bottle as most people expect,\r\nbut forward in the direction of the hand giving the blow. This, again,\r\nis an illustration of the principle of inertia. A rapid blow tends to\r\npush the bottle from the cork before the movement is transmitted to the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nFew people will execute this experiment properly the first time,\r\nfor the instinctive fear to break the bottle and cut their fingers,\r\nwill prevent them giving a blow sharp enough to make this experiment\r\nsuccessfully at the first attempt; but with a little perseverance, the\r\nnecessary degree of force will be gauged to a nicety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fiery Catapult.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a match-box and place it upright edge-wise and place two matches\r\nin each side between the inner and outer box, heads up. They must be\r\ninserted deeply enough to stick firmly.\r\n\r\nPlace a third match cross-wise between them and it will stay there by\r\nthe pressure the latter exercises on them.\r\n\r\nNow light the middle of the horizontal match and wait. What do you\r\nthink will happen? Ask the bystanders which will first catch fire?\r\n\r\nThe natural conclusion they will draw will be the following.\r\n\r\nFrom the middle the frame will spread of course to the two extremities\r\nand light the other two matches, probably this side first where the two\r\nphosphorous heads meet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWell, nothing of the sort happens. When the volume of the burning match\r\nhas diminished, and consequently its rigidity also, the force of its\r\nresistance grows weaker as the combustion proceeds.\r\n\r\nA moment comes when the two vertical matches, trying to assume again\r\ntheir original position, throw off, with a sway, the burning horizontal\r\nmatch.\r\n\r\nThe burning match was rendered flexible in the middle, and is not at\r\nall burned at the ends, and the two matches remain standing as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Make an Exact Balance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo construct by yourselves, with the help of simple materials a balance\r\nof great precision may seem impossible. Nevertheless it can be done.\r\n\r\nA ruler, a tin box, (in which blacking was contained, for example)\r\nthree blocks of wood, two pins, thread, four nails, a small piece of\r\nglass, and cardboard are all the necessary materials, and now to work.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the center of the ruler, and on a cross line\r\nwith one another, stick two pins so that they come out a little on the\r\nother side. At one end of the ruler, in C, nail a small piece of your\r\nbox.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt the spot, where the hook to which the scale is suspended, is to\r\nhang, make an indentation with the point of a nail, so that the hook\r\ndoes not shift at the other extremity, in A, fasten a flat piece of\r\ntin, which will form one of the scales of your balance.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this pan solder a pin point downwards. Your second scale,\r\nB, destined to contain the object or substances to be weighed, will be\r\nformed by the lid of the blacking-tin.\r\n\r\nOn its rim at nearly equal distances pierce four holes, on which the\r\nsuspension-strings will be tied, the latter at their upper end being\r\nunited together in one string, which is tied to a hook (a bent pin or\r\nfishing hook will do.)\r\n\r\nNow the point of support remains to be constructed. On a wooden square,\r\nrather thick, E, fix another block, G, on which gum a piece of glass.\r\nIn the largest block knock four nails to prevent the shaft of the\r\nbalance swerving from right to left.\r\n\r\nThe small truncated pyramid, D, which you perceive on the left of the\r\ndesign, and which is graduated, serves as bench-mark.\r\n\r\nIn order to weigh you use the method due to Borda, called the method of\r\ndouble weights.\r\n\r\nPlace in the scale A a weight which you think is slightly over the\r\none of the substance or object to be weighed. Then the scale B being\r\noccupied, get equilibrium by shifting more or less towards the ruler,\r\nthe weight on the scale A.\r\n\r\nThen note the division indicated by the pin point, and take from scale\r\nB the article placed there, and put therein weights until the point\r\nof scale A tells you that the equilibrium is the same as when the\r\nsubstance was in the scale.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that this balance be exact, provided it answers the\r\nvery small differences in the pans.\r\n\r\nThe one we have indicated will weigh down to a fifty-thousandth part of\r\na pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Recomposition of Light.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a great pity that exquisitely beautiful facts and mysteries are\r\nwrapped up in the crack-jaw terms of foreign languages, and so made to\r\nappear ugly.\r\n\r\nThere is no branch of knowledge more fascinating than light. To follow\r\nup its study is like walking along a shady lane, where at certain\r\ndistances apart the wayfarer lights upon jewels of great brilliance.\r\n\r\nIt has been said above that white light is formed by the union or\r\ncombination of seven colors. When a ray of light passes through a prism\r\nit is split up into the parts of which it is composed, and seven colors\r\nas in the rainbow appear.\r\n\r\nThese colors shade off into one another with every variety of tint,\r\nlike a band of rainbow-colored ribbon. This band is called a spectrum.\r\n\r\nNow, where science classes are held there may be seen a complicated\r\ninstrument, which is used to show how the seven colors unite to form\r\nwhite light. It is a disc on which the colors of the spectrum are\r\npainted, and it is made to spin round with great rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe impression received by the eye, when looking at the revolving disc\r\nis total abstinence of color. In other words it is white light.\r\n\r\nFortunately, you can satisfy yourselves on this point without any other\r\nmaterials than a cardboard disc and a piece of string. On this disc\r\npaint in small sections the colors of the spectrum, repeating them\r\nfour or five times in the following order: red, orange, yellow, green,\r\nblue, indigo, violet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThat the experiment may be entirely successful, the sections must be\r\nmarked off according to the following scale of width of section. Let\r\norange, next to the circumference represent 2: then\r\n\r\n  Red will be represented by 5\r\n  Orange     “    “    “     2\r\n  Yellow     “    “    “     5\r\n  Green      “    “    “     4\r\n  Blue       “    “    “     5\r\n  Indigo     “    “    “     3\r\n  Violet     “    “    “     5\r\n\r\nNow, in any diameter of the disc bore two holes not too near the edge.\r\nThrough them pass a piece of string, and knot the two ends together.\r\nTake hold of the string with both hands, and make the disc spin round.\r\n\r\nThen extend and approach the hands alternately to give a very rapid\r\nmovement to the disc. When revolving rapidly enough you will not be\r\nable to distinguish the separate colors. They all become blended into\r\nwhite light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mysterious Apple.\r\n\r\n\r\nPierce an apple in such a manner as to obtain two holes tending toward\r\nthe middle, and forming a pretty large angle as shown in the figure.\r\nTwo quills or tin tubes should be inserted to make the inside passages\r\nsmooth. Pass a string through the hole and your apple is prepared for a\r\nlittle trick, which, you may be sure will astonish all persons before\r\nwhom you practice it, and who of course are not yet initiated.\r\n\r\nYou fasten one extremity of the string to your foot, and take the\r\nother in your hand so as to produce at will the rigidity of the string.\r\nYou can then command the apple to go down, or to stop, and it will obey\r\nyour order immediately. Indeed, when you straighten the string, the\r\npart which enters the apple pushes against the angle formed by the two\r\npassages, and by the pressure, holds the apple. When on the contrary\r\nyou let go a little, you take away the rigidity and the apple glides\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYou can therefore alternately let the apple go down or stop its course,\r\nand we repeat it, persons not in the secret cannot imagine by what\r\nmeans you get this curious result.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of an apple one takes a wooden ball, the experiment will be\r\nmore interesting and the article will last longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomical Letter-Scales.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a watch or small clock spring, and fix it by the center on a\r\nstick. At the other end attach a small brass hook to hold letters,\r\netc., as shown in the figure.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the hook fix horizontally a small band, running over a\r\nstrip of cardboard, likewise hanging on the stick.\r\n\r\nNow graduate the cardboard strip with real weights, or their exact\r\nequivalents, and after this any small articles may be weighed with\r\nsufficient accuracy. The spring, being of steel, always turns to its\r\noriginal position when the scale is empty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracing a Spiral.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn geometry the process for tracing a spiral by the help of compasses\r\nis pretty long and tedious. The following method will enable you to do\r\nit far more quickly and as accurately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTake a wooden or cardboard cylinder, with a diameter equal to a fourth\r\npart of the distance you require between the spires (or trelices) to be\r\ntraced. On this cylinder fasten one end of a string, B, and wind it up,\r\nand attach to the other end a pencil, C, or a point, according to what\r\nyou want to do.\r\n\r\nNow you have only to turn to right or left according to the direction\r\nin which the string was wound up, by holding the pencil down and\r\nkeeping the string tight, and a spiral of perfect regularity will be\r\ntraced.\r\n\r\nThe above figure clearly shows the process. The cylinder A has a\r\ndiameter equal to the distance R S divided by 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Inclined Plane.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a piece of paper, roll it up into a tube large enough to hold a\r\nmarble, and gum it lengthwise. Then introduce a marble and close the\r\nextremities with a strip of paper as shown below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen you think that it is well dried you place it upright on the upper\r\nend of an inclined board, or flat ruler, leaning on a pile of books for\r\nexample. You will then see the paper cylinder lie down, get up and so\r\non till it reaches the bottom of its course.\r\n\r\nThe effect is very curious and will be more so if you are somewhat of\r\nan artist, and able to draw or paint a figure on the cylinder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Cut a Bottle With a String.\r\n\r\n\r\nGum first two circular pads of paper on each side of the spot where you\r\nintend to cut your bottle. These pads are obtained by gumming several\r\nstrips of paper one over the other, so as to leave between them a\r\ngroove on which you wind the string round once.\r\n\r\nCatch hold of the extremities of the string, and draw it to and fro,\r\nsee-saw fashion, by which friction the part of the glass operated on\r\nwill be heated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs soon as you think that the glass is hot enough, plunge the bottle in\r\ncold water, which you will have placed handy before, and at the spot\r\nwhere the friction was exercised the glass will be clean cut. According\r\nto the thickness of the glass, more or less heat must be produced.\r\nThis process is infallible.\r\n\r\nThe same result can also be produced in another way. It is, when once\r\nthe heat is sufficient to let glide a few drops of water along the\r\nstring. The string must be well wetted. The cut will be as clean as by\r\nthe other process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEquilibrium of a Knife in Mid-Air.\r\n\r\n\r\nBe reassured dear readers, we are not going to ask you to make a\r\nbalance in mid air, that would be too much for our weak capabilities.\r\nThe question is simply to swing a knife horizontally in the space which\r\nsurrounds us. The experiment is curious and easily executed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTake the cork of a champagne bottle. Pierce it lengthwise with a sharp\r\nknife, and let the knife stick out a third of its length from the thin\r\nend of the cork. Then insert into each side of the cork the prongs of\r\ntwo forks, so that they are perpendicular with the blade of the knife\r\nas shown in figure.\r\n\r\nThis operation accomplished, you have only to suspend the point of the\r\nblade on the loop of a string, and the knife will hang horizontally.\r\nYou may then swing it if you choose, and the movement will not destroy\r\nthe equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Trick With Four Matches.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking of matches, there is yet one more trick to be played with four\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nAt the non-phosphoric ends of two matches cut a small notch so that\r\nthey fit into each other. Stretch the matches apart so as to form an\r\nangle, and place them vertically upon the table. Then lean a third\r\nmatch against them so as to form a tripod, standing by itself.\r\n\r\nThe question now is to take up this trivet with a fourth match and\r\ncarry it to another place without disturbing the harmony of the little\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt first sight this seems impossible; it is, however, easily done. You\r\nhave only to slide the fourth match between the two stuck together, and\r\nthe one serving as support.\r\n\r\nBy lightly pressing against the two first ones the third one will\r\nslide, and its upper extremity will come between the angle formed\r\nby the two others. By taking it up briskly, this extremity will be\r\nmaintained, and you are then enabled to carry the little tripod to\r\nanother place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Distance of an Inaccessible Point.\r\n\r\n\r\nEveryone knows what an angle is, and you say at once it is the\r\ninclination of two lines that meet each other. These lines by their\r\nbranching off form an opening more or less wide. This opening is\r\nmeasured by the aid of an instrument called a _protractor_ made\r\nof brass or horn, which finds its place in nearly every box of\r\nmathematical instruments.\r\n\r\nIt represents a semi-circumference, divided into 180 equal parts,\r\ncalled degrees, written thus: 180°. Each degree is divided into 60\r\nminutes, expressed thus: 60 min.; and finally the minutes are divided\r\nagain in 60 parts, called seconds, indicated thus: 60 sec. There are\r\ntherefore in a whole circumference, 360 deg., 2,160 min., and 12,960\r\nsec.\r\n\r\nOne degree, therefore, is the 360th part of a circumference, and thus\r\nwe have a measure independent of all dimensions. For example, on a\r\nround table of 36 yards in circumference, one degree will be marked\r\nby one tenth of a yard; on a pond of 360 yards in circumference, one\r\ndegree will be equal to one yard.\r\n\r\nThe degree, therefore, may be more or less, but it is always the 360th\r\npart of the circumference of a circle. Let it be quite understood that,\r\nwhether an angle is to be on a sheet of paper, or in the skies, the\r\ndivisions do not change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis must be well grasped, it is of the utmost importance for the\r\nexplanations which follow. It is therefore settled: the measure of the\r\nangles has nothing to do whatever with a measure of length.\r\n\r\nWe have shown how to measure an angle. Let us examine now what is a\r\ntriangle, without pondering too much over this geometrical figure,\r\nwhich every one knows. The essential property of this three-cornered\r\nfigure is that the sum of its three angles is always equal to 180\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the protractor placed successively at each angle will\r\ngive three numbers, which, added, make up 180 degrees. Keep this\r\nproperty well in mind, as it will serve us hereafter.\r\n\r\nNow, to what distance does a degree correspond? For example, take a\r\nyardstick, and with the _graphometer_ (an instrument by which angles\r\nare measured), in readiness, carry it from the latter instrument to a\r\ncertain distance, till the two extremities of the yardstick measure one\r\ndegree; this yard is then said to subtend an angle of one degree.\r\n\r\nNow, measure the distance which divides the yardstick from the\r\ninstrument, and you will find it to be 57 yards. Therefore, one degree\r\ncorresponds to an object being at a distance of 57 times its height. A\r\nman two yards high at a distance of 57 times his height, or 114 yards\r\nwill measure one degree.\r\n\r\nOne minute will be represented by a piece of cardboard of a hundreth\r\npart of a yard long seen from a distance of 34 yards; and finally, a\r\nsecond will be given by a card a hundreth part of a yard seen from a\r\ndistance of 2062 yards.\r\n\r\nA hair seen at 20 yards about represents a second. This perhaps, you\r\nthink to be too small to be seen by the naked eye.\r\n\r\nSuppose that you to measure the distance of a church situated on a\r\nheight, and from which you are separated by a river (see fig.) Choose\r\non the river’s bank two spots from which the steeple C can be seen, say\r\nA and B. At B plant a surveying-staff, and with the graphometer, go to\r\nA and find the angle formed by B A C.\r\n\r\nSuppose for example, it reads 84 degrees. Repeating the operation at\r\nB for the measure of the angle C B A, suppose it to be 95 degrees.\r\nMeasure the distance from A to B and let it be 80 yards.\r\n\r\nNow here is the statement of our problem:\r\n\r\nHow to resolve a triangle of which the base is known to be 10 yards,\r\nand two of its angles. Well, we have said above that the sum of the\r\nthree angles is always the same, equal to 180 degrees, having on one\r\nside 84, and on the other 95, that makes together 84 by 95, equal to\r\n179 degrees. The difference between this number and 180 is 1 degree,\r\ntherefore the angle ABC measures one degree.\r\n\r\nWe know that an angle of one degree corresponds to a distance of 57\r\nyards. Multiply the base of our triangle by 57 yards and you obtain a\r\ndistance of the church from the points A and B, 10 by 57, equal to 570\r\nyards. Nothing is more simple than this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe smaller the measured angle the further off the object will be. As\r\nseen in our figure, the upright lines, _m o_, _m’ o’_, _m, o,_, do not\r\nvary, but according to their distances from point C, they form various\r\nangles, _ac_, _a’c’_, _a,c,_, becoming smaller and smaller.\r\n\r\nA graphometer is not always to be had. When approximate distances\r\nonly are required, the following contrivance may be used. Trace on a\r\ncardboard of large size a semi-circumference which one divides first\r\ninto 180 equal parts, then each of these is divided again in 2, 3, 4\r\ndivisions, etc., according to the size given to the circumference,\r\nwhich constitutes a large protractor.\r\n\r\nTo measure an angle place the cardboard upright in an horizontal\r\nposition, supporting it by the center of the semi-circumference by\r\nmeans of a screw fixed on a stick. Then proceed as stated above.\r\n\r\nFrom a pin stuck in the center mark the spot where the visual ray\r\npasses, go to A and to B, and you get approximately the desired result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPractical Tracing of a Meridian Line.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meridian line of a place is an imaginary line passing through this\r\nplace and the center of the sun, when the latter is at the highest\r\npoint of the arc of the circle, which it daily describes. At that very\r\nmoment it is noonday exactly at the place in question.\r\n\r\nAs the position of the earth changes from day to day, the sun does not\r\nevery day touch the meridian line at noon; sometimes it is in advance,\r\nsometimes behind.\r\n\r\nVarious instruments have been invented to indicate in a practical\r\nmanner the meridian of a place. We owe the following construction to\r\nMr. E. Brunner of the longitudinal office.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn a window-sill in a southerly position, fix in a solid, permanent\r\nmanner, a small cupful of quicksilver; cover it with a lid made of\r\nvarnished metal, and pierced in its center by a small round hole about\r\na quarter of an inch in diameter. This lid must fit well, but not too\r\ntightly, so as to permit its being lowered in close proximity to the\r\nsurface of the quicksilver.\r\n\r\nWhen the window is open the solitary ray reflected on the mercury will\r\nbe projected on the ceiling of the room. At the exact noonday the\r\ncenter of the mirror and the center of the reflected image are in the\r\nmeridian plane. It remains only to be traced.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of its passage one marks in B, for example, a spot\r\ncorresponding to the center of the reflected image; one knocks a\r\nsmall nail there, and with a string connect this point with another\r\noutside the window, so that the string passes through the center of the\r\ndiaphragm, M. The line, B M, is the meridian plane. From A, suspend a\r\nlead-line which meets the string, B M.\r\n\r\nAll you have to do now is to join on the ceiling the points, A B, and\r\ncontinue them to D. A black thread may be stretched to serve as the\r\nline, and this is the meridian required.\r\n\r\nTo get the mean time one has only to note the exact passage, and deduct\r\nthe corrections given in various astronomical papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Measure the Height of a Mountain.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne can, without instruments, take the height of a building or a\r\nmountain, provided you are able to measure their base. A yardstick and\r\ntwo ordinary sticks are enough. Suppose the height of the tower, E F,\r\nis to be taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSome distance off plant a stick, a yard high, A B; one yard from this\r\nwe plant another and longer one, C D. Measure exactly the distance,\r\nB F, and applying the eye at A, we aim at the summit of the tower, E;\r\nmark on the stick, C D, the point where the visual ray meets the stick,\r\n_i.e._, point G.\r\n\r\nThen, by measuring the distance, D G, and subtracting one yard you get\r\nG I, and may be expressed in the following statement:\r\n\r\n  A H : A I :: E H : G I\r\n\r\nIn the given example let us suppose that A H = 150 yards, A I will, of\r\ncourse, be equal to one yard; G I =, say four fifths of a yard; the\r\nproblem will be: 150 yards : 1 yard :: _x_ : four fifths of a yard.\r\nWork the sum out, and the value of _x_ is 120 yards.\r\n\r\nHaving taken our lease, A H, at one yard from the ground, we must add\r\none yard to 120, making 121 yards, which is the height of the tower\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Take Up Four Knives with One.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is one more trick of equilibrium, which appears to be interesting\r\nenough to find a place among these experiments.\r\n\r\nWe need not give any long explanations, for our figure fully\r\nillustrates the way in which it has to be executed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFirst place a knife straight before you, then two others which you\r\nplace, blade upon blade, over the first. Finally, the two last ones\r\nare arranged transversely, their blades passing over those of the two\r\nknives put down in the second instance, and below the blade of the\r\nfirst knife.\r\n\r\nBy taking hold of the handle of the first knife, you can lift them up\r\nall at once without breaking the equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tack in the Ceiling.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo nail a tack in the ceiling without hammer, using a ladder or chair\r\nto reach it, seems as impossible as pulling the moon down from the sky.\r\nYet, with a little cleverness, it is quite an easy thing to do.\r\n\r\nPlace a tack, head downwards, on a half dollar, then place a small\r\npiece of tissue paper over it, so that the point of the tack passes\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen turn the sides of the paper down round the coin. Throw the whole,\r\npoint upwards, violently against the ceiling, trying to keep this\r\nprojectile of a new description from turning over on its course.\r\n\r\nWith a little practice the knack is soon acquired. The tack enters the\r\nceiling, the violence of the shock tears the paper, which, carried away\r\nby the coin, falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nSuppose you have a light object to suspend on the ceiling; you may do\r\nit in this manner without much trouble. Simply tie a thread to the\r\ntack, the object being attached to the other end.\r\n\r\nIf the projectile is well thrown the tack will go right in, and stick\r\nvery firmly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jumping Pea.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake an unbroken straw, four or five inches long, not closed by knots,\r\nbut forming a tube, and about one twentieth of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nDivide one of its extremities to a length of about half an inch in\r\nfour, five or six parts, which separate slightly, so as to form a\r\ntruncated cone.\r\n\r\nAfter having thus prepared the straw, take a dry pea, with a larger\r\ndiameter than that of the tube, and place it in the cone. Hold the tube\r\nupwards, and blow into it at the opposite end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe pea will be forced upward by the air column which you blow into\r\nthe tube. It will remain suspended in the air as long as the interior\r\npressure continues, then fall back into the arms of the cone.\r\n\r\nTo vary that experiment pass a long pin through the pea, the point of\r\nwhich is turned into the tube. When well thrown up, the pea can be\r\nmaintained at a distance of two or three inches from the mouth of the\r\nstraw. According to the stronger or weaker blast of breath, the pea\r\nwill go up or down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Acquire a True Eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a peculiar and clever recreation, easily performed, though at\r\nfirst sight it may appear difficult.\r\n\r\nPut a tumbler upside down. By means of bread crumbs, fix a match\r\nvertically on the top. On the edge of the table place another match,\r\npartly raised on a piece of cork or wood.\r\n\r\nStoop down and aim at the vertical match on the glass, so that the one\r\non the table is in the exact line of fire.\r\n\r\nWhen you think it is aimed straight, give it a fillip on the lower end,\r\nit will shoot up and touch the one placed on the glass if the aim be\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf you succeed, you may congratulate yourself on having good eyes--a\r\nvery desirable gift if you should have to handle a gun, as a soldier or\r\na sportsman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Air-Tight Stopper.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many times has it happened to you, when wanting to cork a bottle,\r\nthat the intended cork was too large to enter the neck?\r\n\r\nWhat have you done? Cut the cork all round, and obtained, but\r\nimperfectly, the desired end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNext time when the same occasion arises, turn the difficulty in this\r\nway: Instead of attacking the sides, cut four notches, bevel-shaped,\r\ninto the cork as shown in the figure.\r\n\r\nTreated in this manner your cork will fit, and close the bottle\r\nhermetically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fusee Rocket.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this you only want a simple match box. Take out a match, and\r\nholding it on to the box as shown in figure, _i.e._, hold the box a\r\nlittle slanting, between the thumb and forefinger, and place the match\r\nhead downwards on the side of the emery paper, where the match ignites\r\nwhen rubbed against.\r\n\r\nWith medium force press on the match and with the other hand give it a\r\nfillip in the direction indicated by the arrow.\r\n\r\nThe little missile will fly into the air all ablaze, and fall down at a\r\ndistance of four, five, or even six yards.\r\n\r\nWith a little practice you will succeed each time. It looks like a\r\nsmall rocket, especially when done in complete darkness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBe careful to make the experiment only where there is no danger of\r\nsetting anything on fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Novel Table Mat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo construct this original table mat 6 objects, always at hand when\r\ntable is laid for a meal, are required; 3 knives and three tumblers\r\nof equal size and arrange the tumblers upside down, in the form of a\r\ntriangle, and on each of them rest the handle of a knife. Cross the\r\nblades so that the first laid passes over the second and the second\r\nover the third, this latter passing over the first X.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe blades sustain themselves and you may place on them a dish or any\r\nother heavy object, without being afraid of a collapse.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement is sufficiently shown in the design with out requiring\r\nmore detailed explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeometrical Paper Band.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a band of paper, say a postal wrapper; you observe that it has\r\ntwo lines and two surfaces (interior surface and exterior surface.)\r\nThe problem is to arrange it so that it presents only one line and one\r\nsurface. It may seem improbable, yet it is possible as you will see.\r\nCut the band and gum together again the two pieces thus separated,\r\nafter having turned over one of them as shown in figure as above.\r\nArranged in this manner the paper has but one line and one surface, for\r\nit has the aspect of a screw without end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotographic Camera.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a simple way to construct a camera for a pocket photographic\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nCut out of strong cardboard a piece of about 2 to 2-1/4 inches square.\r\nIn the middle cut out a circle a little smaller than the lens with\r\nwhich you cover it, so that this lens holds on the edge of the hole.\r\n\r\nCut out also two triangles of cardboard, having one side equal to the\r\nsquare, and a length in proportion to the focus of the lens; say for a\r\nsimple lens of 3 inch focus, and one inch diameter, a length of one and\r\na half inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nPaste the two triangles on the square at A and B, their base C must\r\nhold a rectangular mirror of the same dimensions as the side C of the\r\nsquare and the side of the triangles. On side D fix a roughened glass\r\npane, or instead, a thin transparent sheet of paper; tissue paper for\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nCut a black piece of cardboard as indicated in Fig. 3 C; the dotted\r\nlines indicate the sides to be turned down. This shade is fixed on to\r\nthe camera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nPass through the holes, S S, an iron rod or a long needle, which must\r\npass likewise through the upper angle of the triangles, forming the\r\nsides, (Fig. 1). When your lens has been fixed on the round hole of the\r\nsquare your camera is complete.\r\n\r\nThe shade produces complete obscurity so that the operator can see in\r\nthe middle of the camera the object or person he wishes to photograph.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix it on the photographic apparatus, one may fasten a\r\nwire, in the form of an elongated U, just below the mirror at E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Phantom Needle.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know that when you sit at a window with a looking-glass in your\r\nhand, you can catch a beam of sunlight on the glass and throw it into\r\nthe eyes of a person on the other side of the street.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhat have you done in this case? You answer at once that you have bent\r\nthe sunlight out of its course and turned it in another direction. If\r\nthe glass were not there it would fall in a straight line on the window\r\nseat. This bending out of the straight line is called reflection.\r\n\r\nNow for an experiment; cut a small round piece of cork, not quite half\r\nan inch thick. Run a needle into its center and place it in a tumbler\r\ntwo-thirds full of water, needle downwards.\r\n\r\nLooking down on the cork you cannot see the needle. Now alter your\r\nposition, and stoop down so that your eye is on level with the table on\r\nwhich the glass stands. Then you will perceive the needle to be on the\r\ntop of the cork.\r\n\r\nThis apparent topsy-turveydom is called total reflection. The needle is\r\nreflected on the top of the water, and as the ray from your eye meets\r\nthe top of the water, you see the needle, as it were, on the top of the\r\ncork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmphitrite.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt fairs, and in halls of mysteries a variety of optical illusions are\r\npresented. Under the name of Amphitrite, the spectacle is sometimes\r\nof a woman who seems to rise from the deep, moves about in the empty\r\nspace, apparently without being sustained by anything or anybody.\r\n\r\nShe seems completely isolated in mid-air. She turns about, sometimes\r\nin a circle, moving now the legs, then the arms. Then after several\r\ngraceful evolutions in all directions, she stands straight and descends\r\nrapidly, seemingly precipitated into a decorated scenery representing\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe illusion is produced in this way: Behind a well-stretched muslin\r\ncurtain, M M, is painted D D, with the sky and clouds, below a canvas\r\nrepresenting the sea. In front, in the direction of G G, is a mirror,\r\nwithout quicksilver back, inclined at an angle of forty-five degrees.\r\n\r\nBelow the mirror is a round table moving on a pivot, and on this the\r\nactress, who takes the part of the Amphitrite, lays down.\r\n\r\nIn executing various movements, the table in turning, reflects in the\r\nglass the image of the person on whom a vivid light is thrown. The\r\nspectators placed at S see the image on the canvas at the back, D D.\r\nWhen the time comes for making the lady disappear altogether, the\r\ntable, which glides on rails, is drawn off the stage, and Amphitrite\r\nseems to plunge into the waters. It is by this process that the\r\nspecters and ghosts at the theaters are produced.\r\n\r\nYou can perform this illusion, based on the reflection of the light at\r\nhome, in reducing its construction to the simple proportions of a small\r\ntheater of marionettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOptical Illusions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllusions of the eye are numberless, and afford a wide field for\r\nexperiment. For example, if you ask any one wearing a silk high hat,\r\nto what height he thinks his hat would reach if placed on the ground\r\nagainst the wall or door. Nine times out of ten the mark of the height\r\nguessed will be half as much again, at least a third over the real\r\nheight of the hat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAgain, represents two triangles. Ask which is the one whose center is\r\nthe better indicated. Every one will say, “triangle A.” Well, every one\r\nwill be wrong, it is B. Take a pair of compasses and you will easily\r\nprove it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe same occurs with the above figure. The two parallelograms, A B, are\r\nabsolutely equal, and yet A appears to be larger than B. The two lines,\r\nA and B are both of equal length; yet B seems a third longer than A.\r\n\r\nThe sides, AB, CD, BD of the middle figure, BE, AM, EM, etc., are\r\nequal, yet it seems to the eye that the surface, A B E M, is longer\r\nthan the square A B C D.\r\n\r\nThere is another deception the eye is liable to. On a sheet of paper\r\ntrace several circles, having the same center. Place the sheet on your\r\nthumb and turn it horizontally, it will then seem to you as if the\r\nrounds turned, though you watch with the utmost attention, the illusion\r\nwill be complete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn order to terminate this series, which can be varied infinitely, we\r\nwill, in our turn, ask you this question: Which is the tallest man\r\nof the three personages appearing in the adjoining figure? Is it the\r\nfirst, the last, or the middle one?\r\n\r\nTry to find out without any instrument of course, simply by the aid\r\nof your eyes which you suppose exact and true. It will appear to you\r\nat first sight that the artist has made a mistake, and has made a\r\nbad drawing. The last _seems_ the tallest, whereas the first seems\r\nshortened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHowever, measure with a pair of compasses, and the illusion will at\r\nonce disappear. The draughtsman was not mistaken; the first _is_ the\r\ntallest, and the two others go diminishing in height.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis terminates our experiments on optical illusions and you will now\r\nenter upon another field of knowledge altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Insensible Coin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCut a piece of cardboard about six inches long, and by sticking the\r\nextremities together with a pin, or with gum, form a circle or ring.\r\nBalance it carefully on the neck of a wine bottle or decanter, and on\r\nthe top of the ring place a dime, exactly over the neck of the bottle.\r\nNow the trick to be performed is to take off the ring so that, without\r\ntouching it, the coin falls into the bottle. On the inner side of the\r\nring give a sharp knock with the finger, or, better still, with the\r\nthumb and forefinger, as in shooting a marble, as shown in figure. The\r\nring will come off, and the coin which on account of its inertia, does\r\nnot participate in the movement, will infallibly fall into the bottle.\r\nIt is absolutely necessary to strike the interior of the circle,\r\nbecause in striking it from the outside one would not get any result at\r\nall, on account of the elasticity of the cardboard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Asses’ Bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery schoolboy knows which is the famous geometrical theorem, commonly\r\ncalled the Asses’ Bridge, and which is propounded as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe square constructed on the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle is\r\nequivalent to the sum of the squares constructed on the two other sides.\r\n\r\nIf we had only to propound this terrible theorem, it would be an easy\r\nmatter, but the question is to prove it by A and B, and by means of\r\nthe triangles, similar angles, equivalents, etc. Well, instead of all\r\nthis, we give here a very simple way to prove the truth; if not quite\r\npedagogic, it is none the less real.\r\n\r\nTrace on a piece of cardboard or thick paper a square, and divide into\r\n49 parts. This done, cut it out in following the big lines. Take out\r\non the center one division, which add to the small square, and then\r\nconstruct the figure 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe right-angled triangle A C D will be found by the sides of the\r\nthree squares, and the sum of the two small squares constructed on\r\nthe two sides of the triangle will be equivalent to the great square\r\nconstructed on the hypotenuse. Effectively:\r\n\r\n  Square No. 1 has  9 divisions.\r\n  Square No. 2 has 16 divisions.\r\n                   --\r\n       Together    25\r\n                   ==\r\n\r\nAnd the square No. 3 has also 25 divisions. Therefore the theorem is\r\nproved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother Way to Prove the Preceding Theorem.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a square A B D C, trace four similar and equal triangles; cut them\r\nout and dispose them as shown in Fig. 1. You will have in the middle an\r\nempty space forming a great square, which just has one of the sides of\r\nthe hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle A E B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTrace the outlines of this square and remount the triangles one against\r\nthe other, H C E, against A E B, and C D G, against B F G, you will get\r\nthe Fig. below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe successively covered and uncovered parts of the two squares have\r\nnot changed in extent. But this time the uncovered part is formed of\r\nthe two squares 2 and 3 which correspond to those constructed on the\r\ntwo other sides of the triangle, A E B.\r\n\r\nThis very simple demonstration has the advantage of being applicable to\r\nany rectangle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndented Angles.\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven two sheets of paper of the same size and form of a rectangle,\r\nfold them both in four equal parts, one lengthwise and the other\r\nsideways, as shown below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nWhen so folded take a fourth part off each. Part A in the figures. The\r\nquestion is now to cover quite exactly one of the remaining surfaces\r\nwith the other, in cutting the latter in two perfectly equal parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nTo resolve this question take the surface (parts A having been\r\ndetached), with which it is intended to cover the other, fold it again\r\ninto equal parts, but this time in the opposite way to the one in\r\nwhich it was folded first, as indicated in Fig. 4: cut it out then in\r\nfollowing the dotted line, F L, formed by the marks of the fold; this\r\ndone one will obtain two parts absolutely equal, F L.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nIn order to cover the other surface, Fig. 3, all that is now necessary\r\nis to lower the angles, viz.: angle A’, must be in front of angle A,\r\nangle B’ in front of angle B, and angle C’ in front of angle C. When\r\nthe angles are lowered in this way, the two surfaces will be quite\r\nsimilar, and can be covered one by the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nThis experiment can be made either with one or the other sheet, in\r\nlowering or raising the angles.\r\n\r\nIn the example shown here it is the fourth Figure which is destined to\r\ncover the other one.\r\n\r\nWhen the operation is terminated as indicated above, part M, of Fig. 4,\r\nwill be at M’ of Fig. 3, and part O at O’ of the covert figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Cheap Shooting Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a whalebone stay busk, make a bow and draw a target on a card. For\r\nthe arrows, divide lengthwise a steel nib, choosing long shaped ones in\r\nthe form of a lance and fix each part at the end of a match. You now\r\nhave complete a saloon shooting gallery, inoffensive and sufficiently\r\nrecreative at least for your smaller friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coin in Equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a curious demonstration of the balancing of bodies having their\r\ncenter of gravity displaced by a counterpoise.\r\n\r\nWe propose to keep a coin horizontally in equilibrium on the rim of a\r\ntumbler, and it must rest on the glass only by its extreme edge, as\r\nshown by the figure which gives the complete demonstration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTake a silver dollar and place it between the prongs of two forks\r\ncovering each other, then place the edge of the coin upon the glass\r\nand draw the handles of the forks together, or distend them till the\r\nwhole are balanced. The center of gravity will then be at the point of\r\ncontact, and you may give a slight swing without the risk of breaking\r\nthe equilibrium thus obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Submerged Coin.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to make the previous experiment more significant, you may\r\npresent it also in the following manner: In a soup plate place a coin;\r\nbeside the latter an inverted glass, then pour water into the plate\r\njust to cover the coin. You then inform the spectators that you will\r\nwithdraw the coin from the plate without wetting your fingers. You will\r\nmeet with a great deal of disbelief from many of your friends looking\r\non. Leave them in doubt as to the success of your operation.\r\n\r\nCut a round piece off a cork, on the top of which place some pieces\r\nof paper and matches, push the whole underneath the glass, light the\r\nmatches and wait. As soon as the combustion is over, you will see the\r\nwater leave the plate and enter the glass, wherein it rises, leaving\r\nthe piece absolutely dry at the bottom of the plate. You can then\r\nexecute what you offered at first--take out the coin without wetting\r\nyour fingers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs a variation of the preceding experiment, obtain a flat-bottomed\r\ntumbler or glass goblet (but the bottom must be flat), a pocket\r\nhandkerchief and a coin. These are to be seen by everybody present.\r\n\r\nProcure a watch glass, or a round piece of glass like an eye-glass.\r\nThis is not to be shown.\r\n\r\nNow show to the bystanders that you place the coin (say a fifty-cent\r\npiece, for example) in the middle of the handkerchief, and, throwing\r\nback two sides of the latter, point out again that the coin is still in\r\nits place.\r\n\r\nTo show that there is no deception ask someone to hold the coin in the\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\nThen place underneath it a glass containing a little water and call\r\nout, “Hey, Presto! Fly!”\r\n\r\nThe person lets go of the coin and the noise of its falling to the\r\nbottom of the glass is plainly heard.\r\n\r\nYou take up the handkerchief, and every one is astonished at the\r\ndisappearance of the coin, which you can produce from another person’s\r\nhat.\r\n\r\nReally the trick is very simple. For the coin supposed to be held in\r\nthe handkerchief you must dexterously substitute the watch glass or eye\r\nglass. The person holding it, of course, declares he has the coin fast.\r\n\r\nWhen he drops the eye glass it makes the same noise against the tumbler\r\nas would the coin, though, of course, it cannot be seen in the water.\r\n\r\nIt is a capital trick if smoothly performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Smoke Rings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the air of a room is very calm, have you ever noticed that tobacco\r\nsmoke rises slowly and in a nearly vertical direction? Have you never\r\nwatched with interest the grayish or bluish streaks of smoke issuing\r\nfrom the smoke of a cigar or pipe? And in seeing the smoke rise in such\r\na capricious fashion, have you ever ascertained that it is due to the\r\ncalm of the surrounding air?\r\n\r\nOne may get some amusement out of the agitation of the atmosphere.\r\nFor the materials you only require a square or round cardboard box,\r\nin the lid of which cut a round hole of about two inches in diameter.\r\nIn the interior of the box place two sheets of blotting paper, the\r\none impregnated with muriatic acid, the other with ammoniac, in equal\r\nquantities. Immediately a whitish smoke will escape through the hole\r\nand rise straight to the ceiling. If with both hands you give a series\r\nof simultaneous taps on the sides of the box, you will see the smoke\r\nissue in well defined rings, which will disperse rapidly in the air,\r\nand succeed each other as long as you continue the pressure. These\r\nrings are the result of the concussion of the air which you occasion in\r\nthe box. The experiments can be made also with ordinary tobacco smoke,\r\nbut it will last longer in the way we have indicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Walking Cork.\r\n\r\n\r\nStick two knives in a cork, on the same level, and opposite each\r\nother, so as to form a balance. In the bottom of the cork, at an\r\nequal distance, insert two pins, sufficiently deep not to bend under\r\nthe weight which they will have to carry. Rest the pins on a flat\r\nruler, slightly inclined, and give them a slight balancing movement.\r\nThe weight of the apparatus will fall on the pin, A, on which the\r\nwhole turns the knife placed at the side, B, will knock against the\r\nsupport, and will tend to bring the apparatus again into its original\r\nposition as the oscillating movement continues, pin, B, will, in its\r\nturn, support the whole weight, and pin, A, will shift on to the\r\nother point, A, indicated in the figure. The walking cork will thus\r\ncontinue its movement till it has gone over the course assigned to it.\r\nThis recreation is interesting, for it demonstrates once more that all\r\nbodies are attracted by the earth, and that, as soon as they are thrown\r\noff their balance they obey the force which constantly draws them down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Obstinate Cork.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a glass or metal tube, closed at one end, and cut a stopper\r\nin cork or india-rubber to its size so that it closes the tube\r\nhermetically, and take care that it glides in the tube without\r\ndifficulty, and pierce it with a hole. On the top of this hole adapt\r\na small piece of leather, rather larger than the hole, which you must\r\ntake care to wet before proceeding with the following experiment. In\r\norder to be able to withdraw the cork when in the tube, you take the\r\nprecaution to fasten in it both ends of a piece of string, as indicated\r\nin the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese various objects being prepared, will serve to demonstrate once\r\nmore the atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nLift the valve up, force the cork into the tube towards the middle, and\r\nwhen there, put the valve in its place again, and pull quickly on the\r\nstring as if trying to pull the cork out. The latter will not come out,\r\nfor the reason that producing a vacuum before itself, the atmospheric\r\nprepare will prevent it from coming out. But if instead you draw it\r\ngently towards you, it will offer much less resistance, because the\r\nouter air will enter through the smallest interval between the cork\r\nand the glass, and partly destroy the exterior pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetroleum Pulverizer.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the aid of the compressed air reservoir you are able to conduct\r\nvarious soldering operations, requiring often great heat.\r\n\r\nLet us construct the following pulverizer:\r\n\r\nInto a bottle of the shape shown in the figure, put some petroleum, and\r\nintroduce a glass tube that does not quite reach the bottom. Close with\r\nwax that no air can enter, and at the upper extremity of the tube let a\r\nfitting be embedded, a section of which is shown in the engraving. This\r\nfitting has three openings, two horizontals and one corresponding with\r\nthe tube that is plugged into the petroleum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAdjust the india-rubber tube to the reservoir, and when the pressure\r\nis exercised on the surface of the liquid it will force the petroleum\r\nupwards through the tube, and thence it will be blown in a fine spray,\r\nwhich burns as if coming out of an ordinary burner. The particles of\r\noil are mixed with air, and consequently the atoms of air are heated to\r\na high degree. This jet develops a heat of great intensity.\r\n\r\nThis pulverizer may serve also to disinfect rooms. You have only to\r\nreplace the petroleum with an antiseptic liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectric Attraction and Repulsion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poles of the same sign repel, and the contrary poles attract each\r\nother, or, in other words, the negative, or the positive electricity\r\nattracts the electricity of a contrary sign, whereas the electricities\r\nof the same signs repel each other.\r\n\r\nIn order to demonstrate this principle we will contrive a little\r\nplaything which will be as interesting as amusing to see in operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor a pivot take a needle stuck in a cork, and, as magnetic needles,\r\ntwo old corset steels will do very well. If these cannot be had a clock\r\nspring may do instead.\r\n\r\nMagnetize these two steel rods by rubbing them with a magnet. In the\r\nmiddle of one of the rods punch a small hollow so that it may freely\r\nmove on the needle in the cork without fear of falling off. You have\r\nthus manufactured a rough compass.\r\n\r\nThen cut out four dolls in paper, two gentlemen and two ladies, and\r\nstick them in the extremities of the two magnetized needles. Remember\r\nto put at each end a figure of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nNow, each time you present a man to the other man, which is placed on\r\nthe magnetized needle, they will repel each other; if to a lady, the\r\ndolls are attracted.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is easy. You will have taken care to put the puppets\r\non contrary poles: a man on the positive pole, a lady on the negative\r\npole. In this way the principle enunciated above is thoroughly proved\r\nand easily grasped.\r\n\r\nOne may easily vary this experiment by replacing the gentlemen and\r\nladies by personages of actual notoriety, or of the company, in placing\r\nthem in groups which have a mutual dislike to each other, such as the\r\nschoolmaster and pupil, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bust of the Sage.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery person wonders how the sensational decapitation scene is produced.\r\n\r\nTo all appearance a head is thrust through the neck opening of a\r\nguillotine, the knife descends and the head is cut off. However, in\r\norder that none of the fair sex may be alarmed, it may be varied as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nIn a cabinet a mirror is set across, sloping from the top at the back\r\nto the front. It reflects the ceiling, which is covered with the same\r\nmaterial as that which is seen of the floor in front of the mirror.\r\nIn the center of the glass is cut a hole which admits of the passing\r\nthrough of a man’s head. He sits or stands in under the glass at his\r\nease. The front edge of the mirror is concealed by a few astronomical\r\nand geographical instruments, old folio books, skulls, etc.\r\n\r\nThe head and shoulders are made up and draped like one of the seven\r\nwise men of Greece, and he answers questions in a grave, portentous\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Witchery of the Hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the existence of animal magnetism the following\r\napparatus, very simple, and not at all difficult to construct, answers\r\nperfectly.\r\n\r\nStick a pin in a cork, point upwards. On that pivot place horizontally\r\na sheet of paper so that it remains in perfect equilibrium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf you now put your hand over the sheet of paper, a rotary movement\r\nwill manifest itself, the sheet swerving from right to left. This\r\nmovement is caused by the influence of the hand’s magnetism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Perspectograph.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis simple instrument, invented by Mr. Jarlot, renders the tracing\r\nof a sketch extremely easy, besides avoiding absolutely faults of\r\nperspective, which is, without doubt, the principal advantage of this\r\ninstrument. Thanks to it, one obtains an easy reproduction on one plane\r\nof objects placed on different planes.\r\n\r\nHere is a description of this very simple instrument. A wooden frame A\r\nB C D, with a slot in the side, A B, in which a pane of glass can slide\r\nso as to cover the whole space of the frame, _a, b, c, d_, is fixed on\r\na stand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe frame is maintained in a perfectly horizontal position by means of\r\na water level _n n’_, placed on the lower side of the frame. At E is a\r\nsmall rule moving on a hinge at E, allowing the angle to be varied at\r\nthe plane A B C D, by resting it on two supports E E’.\r\n\r\nThe supports themselves move round on an axle fixed on the rule. At the\r\nextremity E’ of this rule is fixed a copper blade curved in E’, C’, and\r\npierced by a small hole of about an eighth of an inch in circumference,\r\nthe edges are made thinner as represented in the diagram placed above;\r\nthe widened part is turned toward the frame.\r\n\r\nSo much for the body of the instrument, now for the accessories. In the\r\nslot left in side, A B C D, lower a glass pane covering the space, _a,\r\nb, c, d_, which is not, however, a necessary condition, it depends on\r\nthe size of the design you desire to take.\r\n\r\nThis pane requires a little preparation. It is done in this way: One\r\nchooses a pane of the desired glass, as free as possible from defects.\r\nCover one side only with turpentine, and which you know is a natural\r\nvarnish.\r\n\r\nSee that this coating is as thin as possible, and to ensure this, go\r\nover the surface with a very soft brush steeped in the liquid. When\r\nyou see that the latter does not run any more, leave off brushing. Let\r\nit dry for two days if necessary; take care, meanwhile, to protect the\r\nvarnished side from dust.\r\n\r\nNow it remains only to show the use of the instrument. Put yourself in\r\nfront of the object you wish to represent. Put the frame in a perfectly\r\nhorizontal position, slide the pane in it, and dispose the rule, E E’\r\n(Fig. 2), in such a manner that, when looking through the little hole,\r\nO, you are able to see the object you want to draw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nThen, with a blue or other colored pencil, trace the outlines of the\r\nobject on the glass coated with turpentine, the use of the latter being\r\nto allow the pencil marks to fix itself on the surface. One sees that\r\nthe outlines thus obtained will be those of the real object as clearly\r\nas possible because they are traced as seen, so to speak.\r\n\r\nBut the principal object of the instrument is not so much exactness of\r\noutline as to get the exact proportion existing between the different\r\nsizes of the objects placed in different planes. We will try to show\r\nthis last result by means of another figure.\r\n\r\nSuppose A B to be an object situated at a certain distance from the eye\r\nposted at _o_, the rays from the eye, O A O B, meets the instrument at\r\n_a_ and _b_, and the image of this object is given by the line, _a b_.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose A’ B’ to be another object situated beyond A B; the eye\r\nhas not changed position, it cannot do so, with reference to the glass,\r\non account of the small rule which is fixed; the image of the object\r\nA’ B’, will be _a’ b’_; thus, one has the true dimensions of A’ B’, in\r\nrespect to A B.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely this proportion which must exist between the sizes of\r\nthe objects placed in different planes, which constitute perspective.\r\nThe instrument, therefore, well deserves its name of Perspectograph.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this apparatus obviates two difficulties:\r\n1, that of the exactness of the sketch, in copying nature as it is\r\npresented to the eye; 2, that of perspective. Having the sketch on\r\nglass it is easy to transfer it on paper. Lift up the rule, E E’, so as\r\nnot to be in the way, place oiled or transparent paper on the glass,\r\nand counter-draw the sketch on it.\r\n\r\nYou can then stick this paper on a cardboard, and, if the operator is\r\na designer, he may reproduce in crayon a very fine drawing. For the\r\nshading he must use his own talent, the aim of the instrument not being\r\nto give a finished drawing, but only a sketch, vigorously exact, and in\r\nunexceptionable perspective.\r\n\r\nThis instrument is often very convenient. When wishing to have a\r\ntrue sketch, you trace it on the glass; you then transfer it to an\r\noil-paper, and again on drawing paper if the former is not to be\r\nused. Besides, if one has an exact sketch on whatever paper, you may\r\nreproduce it in freehand, if you are blessed with any idea of drawing.\r\n\r\nIf the varnished plane has to serve again, wash it with warm water,\r\nand let it get dry; then the varnishing can be done over again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCamphor in Water.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you put very small pieces of camphor on the water, you will see them\r\nturn round each other with great velocity. These movements are due to\r\nthe diminution of the superficial tension of the liquid in the vicinity\r\nof the pieces of camphor.\r\n\r\nIn order to stop them throw a drop of oil in the water, and you will\r\nproduce a perfect calm. One may utilize the camphor for an amusing\r\nrecreation.\r\n\r\nConstruct a small paper or cardboard boat and fasten underneath on the\r\nhind part or stern a piece of camphor. Your boat will maneuver on the\r\nwater. Persons not initiated will be much puzzled, and be long to find\r\nout by what contrivance this small craft is propelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Simple Multiplier.\r\n\r\n\r\nWrite on a card or strong paper the letters, figures, etc., which you\r\nwant to reproduce. Then all along the lines or tracing, with a needle,\r\nprick holes in close proximity at equal distances.\r\n\r\nPlace the sheet so prepared on a pad made of several sheets of blotting\r\npaper, smeared with blue analine ink, or a mixture of lamp-black and\r\noil.\r\n\r\nFix the corners with tacks or drawing pins, and draw your copies by\r\nsimply placing the blank sheets over the pricked one, and press them\r\ndown. The words, figures or designs will be reproduced in dotted lines\r\nif the holes have been well pricked. In this way a good number of\r\ncopies can be drawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Drawing Room Mirror.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn one of the faces of a pane of glass smear some lamp-black mixed with\r\noil. If you place this glass, thus prepared, vertically on an engraving\r\nrepresenting flowers, fruits, birds, etc., you will obtain an infinity\r\nof forms, some of which will be very striking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf you want to reproduce these, to fix their outlines, you have only to\r\ninterpose a transparent paper, to draw along the glass pane a line in\r\npencil and to trace over the part of the picture which terminates at\r\nthe foot of the pane.\r\n\r\nFold the transparent paper along this pencil line, and to get the\r\nwhole reproduced you have only to copy over the designs just traced.\r\nThe glass, which does the duty of a mirror, doubles the forms in a\r\nsymmetrical way, and as it is moved new forms come to view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElementary Gas-Burner.\r\n\r\n\r\nFill an old round tin box, at least two inches high, with sawdust and\r\npieces of blotting paper. Close it as well as possible, and introduce a\r\nsmall metal, or glass, tube in the lid to a depth of about one-third of\r\nthe box.\r\n\r\nMake the joint tight with putty. Put this box on any two supports and\r\nplace the flame of a lamp or candle underneath it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSoon the overheated sawdust and blotting paper will evolve vapors of\r\nalcohol and combustible gases. Approach a lighted match to the upper\r\nend of the tube and you will see the gas ignite and continue to burn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRapid Vegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA cheap sponge can be converted into a hanging bunch of greenery for\r\nroom decoration. Plunge it into hot water, press it dry, then put\r\nin its holes or pores seeds of millet, red clover, barley, linseed,\r\ngrasses, etc., in fact any species of plants which germinate easily\r\nand produce, as far as possible, leaves or blades of different shades.\r\nPlace the sponge thus prepared on a vase or in a saucer, or better\r\nstill, suspend it in the recess of a window, where it may get as much\r\nsunshine as possible. Every morning, for a week, sprinkle its surface\r\nlightly with water. Soon the seeds will germinate and grow. In a short\r\ntime they will form a ball of greenery, making a charming decoration\r\nfor a room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiniature Volcanoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a rather large porcelain or glazed earthenware basin place a small\r\nquantity of nitrate of lead. This may be obtained for a few cents from\r\nany painters’ supplies store. Then upon it throw some flakes of sal\r\nammoniac. Immediately a number of conical elevations will be formed,\r\nwhich give off vapors and burst with a popping noise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAltogether the experiment represents very exactly, volcanoes in a state\r\nof eruption. When the eruption ceases, the rough, broken state of the\r\nremaining mats, represents as nearly as a thing on this earth of ours\r\ncan, the appearance of the moon through a powerful telescope.\r\n\r\nIndeed the moon at one time of its history was undoubtedly in the soft\r\nlava-like state that you will observe in the basin, during the first\r\nstage of this elegant and instructive experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE END.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUSEFUL AND INSTRUCTIVE BOOKS.\r\n\r\nHOW TO DO THE BLACK ART--Containing a complete description of the\r\nmysteries of Magic and Sleight-of-Hand, together with many wonderful\r\nexperiments.
