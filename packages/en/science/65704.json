Old hills and valleys had vanished, new ones had formed, and a\r\nmantle of unconsolidated rock material, the burden carried by the ice\r\nand dropped as the ice melted, lay over most of the region.\r\n\r\nMost of this material, called glacial drift, was brought in by the ice\r\nduring the last two of the four major periods of glaciation—the\r\nIllinoian period 100,000 to 150,000 years ago and the Wisconsinan 5,000\r\nto 50,000 years ago. The older drift introduced during the Kansan and\r\nNebraskan glacial periods is almost entirely buried beneath the later\r\ndrifts.\r\n\r\nThe glaciers covered all of Illinois except the northwestern corner, the\r\nsouthwestern edge along the Mississippi River, and extreme southern\r\nIllinois, as shown in figure 1. In those areas the land is much as it\r\nwas before the glaciers came. In the glaciated portion of the state,\r\nhowever, the bedrock generally is covered by the rock debris the ice\r\ncarried from as far away as Canada. As the fringes of the ice melted,\r\nthese loads of rock material were, in some places, dumped as ridges\r\n(moraines) which are the hills and mounds on the flat prairies of the\r\npresent landscape. Such material also filled ancient river valleys, but\r\nnew valleys were cut by torrents of water released by the melting ice.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 1—A mantle of glacial drift covers the bedrock\r\n    in much of Illinois.]\r\n\r\n  WISCONSINAN GLACIAL DRIFT\r\n  KANSAN GLACIAL DRIFT\r\n  ILLINOIAN GLACIAL DRIFT\r\n\r\nThe glacial drift belongs to the youngest (topmost layer) of the major\r\ndivisions of our rocks, which geologists have named the Pleistocene\r\n(scientific name for Ice Age deposits).\r\n\r\nMost of the drift is an unsorted mixture of clay, pebbles, and boulders\r\ncalled “till,” but some glacial deposits consist of water-sorted sand\r\nand gravel carried and deposited by meltwater from the glaciers. Other\r\nmaterials were deposited by the wind—sand was piled into shifting dunes\r\nand fine silts were spread like a blanket over the land. This mantle of\r\nsilt is called loess.\r\n\r\nThe glacial deposits contain a wide variety of rocks, some brought from\r\nregions to the north, others scoured from the layers of native rock in\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nThe limits of the Illinoian, the Wisconsinan, and the Kansan glaciations\r\nare shown in figure 1. Some of the more prominent moraines are sketched\r\nwith dark gray lines on plate 1. Within this area, glacial drift covers\r\nthe bedrock except along valleys where streams have cut through and\r\nremoved it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BEDROCK GEOLOGY\r\n\r\nBeneath the glacial drift of Illinois many layers of rocks overlie a\r\nbase of ancient crystalline rocks that in Illinois occur at depths of\r\n2,000 to as much as 15,000 feet. The geologic map (plate 1, in pocket)\r\nis drawn as if the mantle of glacial drift had been removed to expose\r\nthe layers of bedrock, which are largely limestone, shale, and\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\nThe key on the map shows the age sequence of the rocks, arranged with\r\nthe youngest at the top, and gives the names that geologists have\r\nassigned to the various systems of rocks. Each system consists of rocks\r\nthat were deposited during a long period of time. The complete sequence\r\nof rocks might be likened to a book of earth history, and each system\r\nlikened to a chapter. Systems are divided into formations, which might\r\nbe regarded as pages in the book.\r\n\r\nAs shown on the generalized rock column in figure 2, the rocks next\r\nolder than the glacial drift (Pleistocene) are the Tertiary and\r\nCretaceous sands, gravels, and clays, mostly unconsolidated. They occur\r\nonly at the extreme southern tip of Illinois and were deposited when\r\nthat area was covered by a northward extension of the Gulf of Mexico.\r\nThe Tertiary rocks are shown on the map in grayed pink (T) and the\r\nCretaceous in red-violet (K).\r\n\r\nNext older than the Cretaceous are the Pennsylvanian rocks, named for\r\nthe state of Pennsylvania where they are well exposed and were first\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvanian System is divided into two areas on the map (P¹ and\r\nP²). The rocks shown in lightest gray (P²) lie above the No. 6 Coal in\r\nthe sequence and those in medium gray (P¹) lie below it. The No. 6 Coal\r\nis one of the thickest, most valuable coals in the state. Pennsylvanian\r\nrocks occur under the glacial drift, and their thickness ranges from a\r\nfew feet to as much as 3,000 feet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 2—Diagram of layers of rocks in Illinois. The\r\n    oldest rocks are at the bottom, the youngest at the top. Names are\r\n    the standard ones applied by geologists to the subdivisions of the\r\n    geologic eras.]\r\n\r\n Era                                 General Types of Rocks\r\n    Period or System and Thickness\r\n       Epoch\r\n\r\n CENOZOIC “Recent Life”\r\n Age of Mammals\r\n    Quaternary\r\n    0-500′\r\n       Pleistocene or Glacial Age\r\n                        Recent—alluvium in river valleys\r\n                        Glacial till, glacial outwash, gravel, sand,\r\n                        silt lake deposits of clay and silt, loess and\r\n                        sand dunes; covers nearly all of state except\r\n                        northwest corner and southern tip\r\n    Tertiary\r\n    0-500′\r\n       Pliocene         Chert gravel; present in northern, southern, and\r\n                        western Illinois\r\n       Eocene           Mostly micaceous sand with some silt and clay;\r\n                        present only in southern Illinois\r\n       Paleocene        Mostly clay, little sand; present only in\r\n                        southern Illinois\r\n MESOZOIC “Middle Life”\r\n Age of Reptiles\r\n    Cretaceous          Mostly sand, some thin beds of clay and,\r\n    0-300’              locally, gravel; present only in southern\r\n                        Illinois\r\n PALEOZOIC “Ancient Life”\r\n    Age of Amphibians and Early Plants\r\n    Pennsylvanian       Largely shale and sandstone with beds of coal,\r\n    0-3,000′            limestone, and clay\r\n    (“Coal Measures”)\r\n    Mississippian       Black and gray shale at base; middle zone of\r\n    0-3,500’            thick limestone that grades to siltstone, chert,\r\n                        and shale; upper zone of interbedded sandstone,\r\n                        shale and limestone\r\n    Age of Fishes\r\n    Devonian            Thick limestone, minor sandstones and shales;\r\n    0-1,500’            largely chert and cherty limestone in southern\r\n                        Illinois\r\n    Age of Invertebrates\r\n    Silurian            Principally dolomite and limestone\r\n    0-1,000’\r\n    Ordovician          Largely dolomite and limestone but contains\r\n    500-2,000’          sandstone, shale, and siltstone formations\r\n    Cambrian            Chiefly sandstones with some dolomite and shale;\r\n    1,500-3,000’        exposed only in small areas in north-central\r\n                        Illinois\r\n ARCHEOZOIC and PROTEROZOIC\r\n                        Igneous and metamorphic rocks; known in Illinois\r\n                        only from deep wells\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvanian System contains many different kinds of rocks,\r\nincluding all of our minable coals. It also contains important deposits\r\nof limestone, shale, and clay, and at places oil and gas.\r\n\r\nNext below the Pennsylvanian are the rocks of the Mississippian System,\r\nshown in blue on the map (M¹ and M²). The lower and middle Mississippian\r\nrocks (M¹) are largely limestone in and near the areas mapped, but in\r\nthe central and eastern part of the state where they are buried under\r\nPennsylvanian rocks they contain much siltstone and cherty limestone.\r\nThe upper Mississippian rocks (M²) consist of a succession of sandstone,\r\nshale, and limestone formations.\r\n\r\nThis system of rocks takes its name from the Mississippi River because\r\nthere are excellent exposures of these strata along the Mississippi\r\nValley in western Illinois, southeastern Iowa, and eastern Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippian rocks are a source of limestone, fluorspar, zinc, and\r\nganister, and are of greatest economic significance in southeastern\r\nIllinois where they are the most important of our oil-producing rocks.\r\n\r\nThe Devonian (D, dark gray on the map), Silurian, (S, violet),\r\nOrdovician (O, light pink), and Cambrian (C, deep pink) rocks, in the\r\norder named, are older than the Mississippian strata. In general, they\r\ninclude dolomite, limestone, shale, and sandstone. Except for small\r\nareas along the Mississippi and Illinois River Valleys, these older\r\nrocks are found at the surface only in the northern quarter of the state\r\nand locally in Alexander, Hardin, Jackson, Monroe, Pike, and Union\r\nCounties. They are nevertheless economically important because they\r\nyield limestone, dolomite, silica sand, oil, zinc and lead, tripoli,\r\nnovaculite, and novaculite gravel.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Cambrian through Pennsylvanian Systems belong to the\r\nPaleozoic Era. The Paleozoic rocks overlie crystalline rocks, such as\r\ngranites, that extend to unknown depths in the crust of the earth. The\r\ncrystalline rocks are not exposed in Illinois but are encountered in the\r\ndrilling of some deep wells and may be seen in the nearby Missouri\r\nOzarks and in central Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe rock formations appear to lie flat in most of Illinois, but they are\r\nslightly inclined in most places. In some areas they are down-warped\r\ninto basins and troughs (synclines), upfolded into domes and arches\r\n(anticlines), or broken by faults.\r\n\r\nThe largest structural feature in Illinois is a great spoon-shaped\r\nbasin—the Illinois Basin—that extends southeastward into Indiana and\r\nKentucky. The deepest part of the basin is in southeastern Illinois.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 3—When rocks are down-warped and the surface\r\n    is leveled by erosion, the youngest rocks are preserved in the\r\n    center and the older rocks are exposed at the margins.]\r\n\r\nBecause the entire region, including the basin, has been eroded by rain,\r\nice, wind, and many rivers and streams, the youngest Paleozoic rocks\r\n(top-most layers) are preserved only in the middle of the basin, as\r\nshown in figures 3, 6, and 7. This is why the map shows the coal-bearing\r\nrocks of Pennsylvanian age in the center of the state and the older\r\nrocks cropping out in successive bands around the margins of the basin\r\nin southern, western, and northern Illinois.\r\n\r\nDistribution of bedrock in northern Illinois is influenced by a broad\r\nupfold or arch (see figures 4, 6, and 7). The map (plate 1) shows the\r\nolder rocks (Cambrian and Ordovician) exposed at the center of the arch\r\nand surrounded by younger Silurian and Devonian rocks. Another elongated\r\nupfold (anticlinal belt) extends from the vicinity of Dixon\r\nsoutheastward into Indiana. The crest of the upfold is indicated on the\r\nmap by patches of Silurian and Devonian rocks in Champaign and Douglas\r\nCounties.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 4—When rocks are upfolded and the surface is\r\n    eroded, the older rocks are exposed at the crest of the dome or\r\n    anticline.]\r\n\r\nIn extreme southern Illinois and in north-central Illinois, the rock\r\nlayers are broken by great faults (see figures 5 and 6) which displace\r\nthe layers of rocks by as little as a few inches to as much as 3,000\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe structural map of Illinois (figure 6) shows the position of the\r\nmajor geologic structures. The big basin is indicated by shading, with\r\nthe darkest pattern showing where the basin is deepest. The same strata\r\nthat lie at sea level at the basin’s outer edge are downwarped to 6,000\r\nfeet below sea level in its deepest part. Axes of some small anticlines\r\nand locations of major fault zones also are shown.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 5—When rocks are faulted by earth stresses,\r\n    the layers of rock are displaced or offset.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 6—Major structural features of Illinois—the\r\n    Illinois Basin, anticlines, and faults.

The geologist must examine, or read, each rock layer, from the\r\nyoungest at the top to the oldest at the bottom, searching for clues to\r\nits origin, age, and development from which he can reconstruct the past.\r\n\r\nOne of the clues to the past is the fossil remains of plants and animals\r\nfound in the rocks. For instance, if a certain coral is known to have\r\nlived only during one span of time, all rocks containing that coral\r\nfossil must have been formed within that span.\r\n\r\nRecords of wells (well logs) and rock cores or samples collected when\r\ntest holes are drilled into the bedrock also reveal much about the\r\nsequence of rock strata beneath the surface. The kinds of rocks\r\nencountered tell, in addition, something about ancient geography, for\r\nsome were formed on land and others were deposited in long-departed\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nSuch knowledge is extremely important in finding and developing mineral\r\nresources such as coal and oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ECONOMIC GEOLOGY\r\n\r\nMinerals produced commercially in Illinois include crude oil, coal,\r\nlimestone, dolomite, clay, sand, gravel, fluorspar, tripoli, ganister,\r\nnovaculite gravel, silica sand, and the metals zinc and lead. The\r\ndistribution of mineral industries, shown in the several maps of figures\r\n8 through 12, is, of course, related to the distribution of the rocks\r\n(plate 1). For example, the coal mines are scattered along the margin of\r\nthe area of Pennsylvanian rocks where the coals are at relatively\r\nshallow depths.\r\n\r\nThe mineral fuels, coal and petroleum, are the leading mineral products\r\nof Illinois, making up about 70 percent of the annual value of all\r\nminerals produced in the state. For many years coal was at the top of\r\nthe list, but petroleum now holds first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Petroleum\r\n\r\nIn recent years production of petroleum has averaged about 78 million\r\nbarrels each year, making Illinois the eighth largest petroleum\r\nproducing state. The major oil area is the deep part of the Illinois\r\nBasin in the southcentral and southeastern parts of the state, but\r\nsignificant discoveries have been made recently in central and western\r\nIllinois. There are about 490 oil fields in Illinois, ranging from a few\r\nto several thousand acres in size.\r\n\r\nOil has been discovered in rocks of the Pennsylvanian, Mississippian,\r\nDevonian, Silurian, and Ordovician Systems, but the Mississippian are\r\nthe most productive and account for about 76 percent of our total oil\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 8—Oil pools in Illinois as of January 1, 1961.\r\n    The pools are concentrated mainly in the Illinois Basin and along\r\n    the LaSalle Anticlinal Belt.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 9—Active coal mines are scattered around the\r\n    margin of the basin where the coals are at relatively shallow\r\n    depths.]\r\n\r\n  KEY\r\n    SHIPPING MINES\r\n      Underground\r\n      Strip\r\n      Slope\r\n    LOCAL MINES OVER 25,000 TONS\r\n      Underground\r\n      Strip\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Coal\r\n\r\nIllinois ranks fourth in the nation among states that produce bituminous\r\ncoal, the type of coal most widely mined in the United States. Coal is\r\nused by many manufacturing industries, by public utilities companies\r\nthat burn coal to generate electricity, and by individuals for heating\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nAll Illinois coal deposits are found in the Pennsylvanian System. Of the\r\nmany coals, only a few are thick enough to be mined profitably. The coal\r\nis of bituminous rank, but it varies in quality. Illinois coal reserves\r\nin strata more than 28 inches thick are estimated at 137 billion tons\r\nand are larger than those of any other state.\r\n\r\nAround the edge of the coal basin where the coal lies at shallow depths,\r\nit is commonly mined in open pits (strip mines). However, in the past,\r\nmost coal has been mined underground, and more than half of Illinois\r\ncoal is still produced from such mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Limestone and Dolomite\r\n\r\nThere are two types of carbonate rocks in Illinois, limestone and\r\ndolomite. In appearance they are almost indistinguishable, although they\r\nare different chemically. Limestone is composed mainly of calcium\r\ncarbonate (the mineral calcite), whereas dolomite is calcium magnesium\r\ncarbonate (the mineral dolomite).\r\n\r\nLimestone deposits are found at many places in the western,\r\nsouthwestern, and southern marginal portions of the state. They are\r\nlargely of Mississippian and Ordovician age. Lesser deposits of\r\nPennsylvanian limestone are found in the central portion of the state.\r\nIn the northern fifth of the state, dolomites of Silurian and Ordovician\r\nage are exposed at many places.\r\n\r\nLimestone and dolomite are quarried for a variety of uses, including\r\naggregate for concrete, agricultural limestone, railroad ballast, chips\r\nfor bituminous roads, and for use in metallurgical and chemical\r\nprocesses. They also are quarried for building stone at some places, and\r\nmarble is produced in southern Illinois.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 10—Limestone and dolomite are quarried at many\r\n    places, but fluorspar, zinc, and lead are produced in restricted\r\n    mineralized areas.]\r\n\r\n  KEY\r\n    Quarry, Limestone or Dolomite\r\n    Cement or Lime\r\n    Fluorspar\r\n    Zinc and Lead\r\n\r\nLimestone and shale or clay are burned together in kilns to produce\r\nportland cement. Portland cement is manufactured from a Pennsylvanian\r\nlimestone in LaSalle County and from an Ordovician limestone in Lee\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nLimestone or dolomite also is burned in kilns to make lime.\r\nMississippian limestone is used in Adams County and Silurian dolomite is\r\nused in Cook County for lime making.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Clay and Clay Products\r\n\r\nIllinois commercial clays are found in glacial, Cretaceous, Tertiary,\r\nand Pennsylvanian deposits. Pennsylvanian shales also are sources of\r\nclays. Glacial clays, which occur as loess (wind-blown materials),\r\nalluvial (water-deposited) sediments, and glacial till, are widespread\r\nin the state. Cretaceous and Tertiary clays, at the extreme southern tip\r\nof the state, are valuable for the manufacture of heat-resistant bricks\r\nand coatings and for floor-sweeping compounds.\r\n\r\nPennsylvanian clays and shales are the most important source of clay for\r\nmanufacturing such products as pottery, stoneware, drain tile, sewer\r\npipe, flue tile, building tile, brick, and special heat-resistant\r\nfire-brick.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Sand and Gravel\r\n\r\nDeposits of sand and gravel, found in many parts of Illinois, provide\r\nlarge quantities of material for concrete, railroad ballast, road\r\ngravel, building sand, molding sand, and other uses. Glacial deposits\r\nare the principal sources of sand and gravel, but in extreme southern\r\nIllinois where there is no glacial drift the main source of supply is\r\nTertiary gravel and Devonian chert gravel.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 11—The clay industry is scattered widely in\r\n    Illinois. Many manufacturing plants are located at the clay pits.]\r\n\r\n  KEY\r\n    Pit or Plant\r\n\r\nAlmost every county has some sand and gravel, but the major areas of\r\nproduction are northeastern Illinois and some of the major rivers.\r\nConsiderable tonnages of sand and gravel are dredged from bars in the\r\nchannels of the Mississippi, Ohio, and Wabash Rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Silica Sand\r\n\r\nSilica sand is used in making glass, for sand blasting, as grinding\r\nsand, as molding sand for casting steel, and in the fracture treatment\r\nof oil wells to increase oil production. Some of the sand is finely\r\npulverized into a powder that is used as a filler, a fine abrasive, as a\r\nceramic material, and for many other purposes.\r\n\r\nThis special sand, composed of grains of the mineral quartz (silica),\r\ncomes from a sandstone of Ordovician age that is mined in LaSalle and\r\nOgle Counties.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Tripoli and Ganister\r\n\r\nTripoli, or “amorphous” silica, is mined from Devonian rocks in\r\nAlexander County. The silica is finely ground for use as a polishing\r\nagent, as a filler, in buffing compounds, and for other purposes.\r\n\r\nGanister, a granular material with a high silica content, also is mined\r\nin extreme southern Illinois. It is used in making products that can\r\nwithstand high temperatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Fluorspar\r\n\r\nFor many years Illinois has led the nation in the production of\r\nfluorspar, accounting annually for about half the total United States\r\noutput. The industry is centered in Hardin and Pope Counties where the\r\ndeposits occur in veins and beds in rocks of the Mississippian System.\r\nReserves of fluorspar are adequate to supply the industry for many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 12—Sand and gravel is produced at many places\r\n    in the state. Silica sand is produced only from a sandstone in\r\n    northern Illinois.

Deposits\r\nare found in Jo Daviess County in northwestern Illinois and in the\r\nfluorspar area of Hardin and Pope Counties in extreme southern Illinois.\r\nIn northwestern Illinois the ore occurs in rocks of Ordovician age, but\r\nin southeastern Illinois it is associated with fluorspar in rocks of\r\nMississippian age.\r\n\r\nBetween 1820 and 1865, the mining area of which northwestern Illinois is\r\na part was the nation’s principal producer of lead ore. In recent years\r\nproduction of zinc has increased and that of lead has decreased.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Water Supplies\r\n\r\nWater, too, is a mineral resource, and our most necessary one. The\r\nsource of nearly all water is rain and snow, which collect in lakes and\r\nstreams or seep into the ground to form our two types of water\r\nsupplies—surface water and ground water.\r\n\r\nGround water in Illinois collects underground in deposits of sand and\r\ngravel or in the porous sandstone or limestone layers of bedrock. These\r\nrock materials are called “aquifers” because of their ability to hold\r\nwater and to allow it to flow into wells that are drilled into them.\r\n\r\nThe aquifers are not equally distributed throughout Illinois, so\r\nground-water supplies are abundant in some parts of the state but are\r\nscarce in others. Some Illinois cities depend wholly or partly on\r\nsurface supplies from lakes and rivers.\r\n\r\nThe sand and gravel aquifers yield more ground water than any others in\r\nIllinois. The major sand and gravel aquifers were deposited by streams\r\nand lie along river valleys. Some of these river valleys are no longer\r\nvisible to us because they were buried by glacial drift. They are\r\nrecognized, however, from well records or drilling records.\r\n\r\nThe northern third of Illinois has the most abundant supplies of ground\r\nwater. Bedrock formations of Devonian through Cambrian age are favorable\r\naquifers and supply drinkable (potable) water at depths of from 200 to\r\n2,000 feet. These formations, however, lie much deeper in the Illinois\r\nBasin, where the water they furnish is too salty for most uses.\r\n\r\nWest of the Illinois River and at the southern tip of the state, the\r\nMississippian, Devonian, and Silurian limestones are the chief aquifers.\r\nTheir yield, however, is small.\r\n\r\nIn the Illinois Basin all these formations are overlain by Pennsylvanian\r\nrocks which offer only small, scattered supplies of ground water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ILLINOIS STATE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY\r\n\r\n\r\nA city or farmer needs a new water supply. Where can suitable\r\nwater-bearing formations be found? A new limestone quarry is considered.\r\nWhere are the most suitable limestone deposits? A coal mine is being\r\nplanned. How deep must a shaft be sunk to reach the nearest minable coal\r\nand what will the mining conditions be? A land owner has a clay deposit\r\non his land. What uses can be made of it? A road is to be constructed.\r\nAre sand and gravel or limestone deposits available nearby for\r\nconstruction materials? A farmer wants to know whether there might be\r\noil on his property. Are oil-bearing structures present and, if so, at\r\nwhat depth?\r\n\r\nThese are typical questions brought to the Illinois State Geological\r\nSurvey by the industries and people of Illinois. From its accumulated\r\nstore of information and experience, the Survey provides answers. This\r\nstorehouse of knowledge is the result of the Survey’s continuous program\r\nof geologic exploration, mapping, research, and organization and\r\ninterpretation of data.\r\n\r\nThe Survey explores and maps the geology and mineral resources of the\r\nstate, does research to find new and improved uses for our mineral\r\nresources, and organizes and interprets basic geologic information\r\ngathered from well logs, rock samples, and field studies, putting them\r\nall into usable form.\r\n\r\nSuch knowledge is shared with the public through publications, maps,\r\nlectures, and personal consultations with industries, drillers,\r\nengineers, land owners, teachers, and others in need of geologic\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of facts about the rich mineral resources of Illinois has,\r\nin effect, only begun, and it is the task of the Geological Survey to\r\ncontinue to collect and apply new information so that our resources can\r\nbe used to the best advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     EDUCATIONAL EXTENSION PROGRAM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Educational Extension Section of the Geological Survey conducts six\r\nfield trips each year, in various parts of the state, for teachers,\r\nstudents, and laymen. It also assembles and distributes rock and mineral\r\ncollections for Illinois educational groups, gives lectures, prepares\r\nexhibits, and identifies rocks and minerals for the public.\r\n\r\n\r\nEducational Extension publications, such as this book, are simplified\r\ndiscussions of geological subjects. Available for 25 cents each, these\r\ninclude:\r\n\r\n    Educational Series 4: Guide for Beginning Fossil Hunters, by Charles\r\n          W. Collinson.\r\n    Educational Series 5: Guide to Rocks and Minerals of Illinois.\r\n    Educational Series 6: Field Book of Pennsylvanian Plant Fossils of\r\n          Illinois, by Charles Collinson and Romayne Skartvedt.\r\n\r\nMany technical discussions of the various phases of Illinois geology\r\nalso are published by the Geological Survey. Regional reports on the\r\ngeology and mineral resources of some areas are available in many school\r\nand public libraries or they may be purchased from the Survey.
