APPLETON AND COMPANY,\r\n   1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE knowledge of the origin of cultivated plants is interesting to\r\nagriculturists, to botanists, and even to historians and philosophers\r\nconcerned with the dawnings of civilization.\r\n\r\nI went into this question of origin in a chapter in my work on\r\ngeographical botany; but the book has become scarce, and, moreover,\r\nsince 1855 important facts have been discovered by travellers,\r\nbotanists, and archæologists. Instead of publishing a second edition, I\r\nhave drawn up an entirely new and more extended work, which treats of\r\nthe origin of almost double the number of species belonging to the\r\ntropics and the temperate zones. It includes almost all plants which are\r\ncultivated, either on a large scale for economic purposes, or in\r\norchards and kitchen gardens.\r\n\r\nI have always aimed at discovering the condition and the habitat of each\r\nspecies before it was cultivated. It was needful to this end to\r\ndistinguish from among innumerable varieties that which should be\r\nregarded as the most ancient, and to find out from what quarter of the\r\nglobe it came. The problem is more difficult than it appears at first\r\nsight. In the last century and up to the middle of the present authors\r\nmade little account of it, and the most able have contributed to the\r\npropagation of erroneous ideas. I believe that three out of four of\r\nLinnæus’ indications of the original home of cultivated plants are\r\nincomplete or incorrect. His statements have since been repeated, and in\r\nspite of what modern writers have proved touching several species, they\r\nare still repeated in periodicals and popular works. It is time that\r\nmistakes, which date in some cases from the Greeks and Romans, should be\r\ncorrected. The actual condition of science allows of such correction,\r\nprovided we rely upon evidence of varied character, of which some\r\nportion is quite recent, and even unpublished; and this evidence should\r\nbe sifted as we sift evidence in historical research. It is one of the\r\nrare cases in which a science founded on observation should make use of\r\ntestimonial proof. It will be seen that this method leads to\r\nsatisfactory results, since I have been able to determine the origin of\r\nalmost all the species, sometimes with absolute certainty, and sometimes\r\nwith a high degree of probability.\r\n\r\nI have also endeavoured to establish the number of centuries or\r\nthousands of years during which each species has been in cultivation,\r\nand how its culture spread in different directions at successive epochs.\r\n\r\nA few plants cultivated for more than two thousand years, and even some\r\nothers, are not now known in a spontaneous, that is, wild condition, or\r\nat any rate this condition is not proved. Questions of this nature are\r\nsubtle. They, like the distinction of species, require much research in\r\nbooks and in herbaria. I have even been obliged to appeal to the\r\ncourtesy of travellers or botanists in all parts of the world to obtain\r\nrecent information. I shall mention these in each case with the\r\nexpression of my grateful thanks.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these records, and of all my researches, there still remain\r\nseveral species which are unknown wild. In the cases where these come\r\nfrom regions not completely explored by botanists, or where they belong\r\nto genera as yet insufficiently studied, there is hope that the wild\r\nplant may be one day discovered. But this hope is fallacious in the case\r\nof well-known species and countries. We are here led to form one of two\r\nhypotheses; either these plants have since history began so changed in\r\nform in their wild as well as in their cultivated condition that they\r\nare no longer recognized as belonging to the same species, or they are\r\nextinct species. The lentil, the chick-pea, probably no longer exist in\r\nnature; and other species, as wheat, maize, the broad bean, carthamine,\r\nvery rarely found wild, appear to be in course of extinction. The number\r\nof cultivated plants with which I am here concerned being two hundred\r\nand forty-nine, the three, four, or five species, extinct or nearly\r\nextinct, is a large proportion, representing a thousand species, out of\r\nthe whole number of phanerogams. This destruction of forms must have\r\ntaken place during the short period of a few hundred centuries, on\r\ncontinents where they might have spread, and under circumstances which\r\nare commonly considered unvarying. This shows how the history of\r\ncultivated plants is allied to the most important problems of the\r\ngeneral history of organized beings.\r\n\r\n   GENEVA, 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n   PART I.\r\n\r\n   GENERAL REMARKS.\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER                                                      PAGE\r\n\r\n    I.

There are reasons why this should be the case with\r\nthe first attempts at agriculture or horticulture. Between the custom of\r\ngathering wild fruits, grain, and roots, and that of the regular\r\ncultivation of the plants which produce them, there are several steps. A\r\nfamily may scatter seeds around its dwelling, and provide itself the\r\nnext year with the same product in the forest. Certain fruit trees may\r\nexist near a dwelling without our knowing whether they were planted, or\r\nwhether the hut was built beside them in order to profit by them. War\r\nand the chase often interrupt attempts at cultivation. Rivalry and\r\nmistrust cause the imitation of one tribe by another to make but slow\r\nprogress. If some great personage command the cultivation of a plant,\r\nand institute some ceremonial to show its utility, it is probably\r\nbecause obscure and unknown men have previously spoken of it, and that\r\nsuccessful experiments have been already made. A longer or shorter\r\nsuccession of local and short-lived experiments must have occurred\r\nbefore such a display, which is calculated to impress an already\r\nnumerous public. It is easy to understand that there must have been\r\ndetermining causes to excite these attempts, to renew them, to make them\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe first cause is that such or such a plant, offering some of those\r\nadvantages which all men seek, must be within reach. The lowest savages\r\nknow the plants of their country; but the example of the Australians and\r\nPatagonians shows that if they do not consider them productive and easy\r\nto rear, they do not entertain the idea of cultivating them. Other\r\nconditions are sufficiently evident: a not too rigorous climate; in hot\r\ncountries, the moderate duration of drought; some degree of security and\r\nsettlement; lastly, a pressing necessity, due to insufficient resources\r\nin fishing, hunting, or in the production of indigenous and nutritious\r\nplants, such as the chestnut, the date-palm, the banana, or the\r\nbreadfruit tree. When men can live without work it is what they like\r\nbest. Besides, the element of hazard in hunting and fishing attracts\r\nprimitive, and sometimes civilized man, more than the rude and regular\r\nlabour of cultivation.\r\n\r\nI return to the species which savages are disposed to cultivate. They\r\nsometimes find them in their own country, but often receive them from\r\nneighbouring peoples, more favoured than themselves by natural\r\nconditions, or already possessed of some sort of civilization. When a\r\npeople is not established on an island, or in some place difficult of\r\naccess, they soon adopt certain plants, discovered elsewhere, of which\r\nthe advantage is evident, and are thereby diverted from the cultivation\r\nof the poorer species of their own country. History shows us that\r\nwheat, maize, the sweet potato, several species of the genus Panicum,\r\ntobacco, and other plants, especially annuals, were widely diffused\r\nbefore the historical period. These useful species opposed and arrested\r\nthe timid attempts made here and there on less productive or less\r\nagreeable plants. And we see in our own day, in various countries,\r\nbarley replaced by wheat, maize preferred to buckwheat and many kinds of\r\nmillet, while some vegetables and other cultivated plants fall into\r\ndisrepute because other species, sometimes brought from a distance, are\r\nmore profitable. The difference in value, however great, which is found\r\namong plants already improved by culture, is less than that which exists\r\nbetween cultivated plants and others completely wild. Selection, that\r\ngreat factor which Darwin has had the merit of introducing so happily\r\ninto science, plays an important part when once agriculture is\r\nestablished; but in every epoch, and especially in its earliest stage,\r\nthe choice of species is more important than the selection of varieties.\r\n\r\nThe various causes which favour or obstruct the beginnings of\r\nagriculture, explain why certain regions have been for thousands of\r\nyears peopled by husbandmen, while others are still inhabited by nomadic\r\ntribes. It is clear that, owing to their well-known qualities and to the\r\nfavourable conditions of climate, it was at an early period found easy\r\nto cultivate rice and several leguminous plants in Southern Asia, barley\r\nand wheat in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, several species of Panicum in\r\nAfrica, maize, the potato, the sweet potato, and manioc in America.\r\nCentres were thus formed whence the most useful species were diffused.\r\nIn the north of Asia, of Europe, and of America, the climate is\r\nunfavourable, and the indigenous plants are unproductive; but as hunting\r\nand fishing offered their resources, agriculture must have been\r\nintroduced there late, and it was possible to dispense with the good\r\nspecies of the south without great suffering. It was different in\r\nAustralia, Patagonia, and even in the south of Africa. The plants of the\r\ntemperate region in our hemisphere could not reach these countries by\r\nreason of the distance, and those of the intertropical zone were\r\nexcluded by great drought or by the absence of a high temperature. At\r\nthe same time, the indigenous species are very poor. It is not merely\r\nthe want of intelligence or of security which has prevented the\r\ninhabitants from cultivating them. The nature of the indigenous flora\r\nhas so much to do with it, that the Europeans, established in these\r\ncountries for a hundred years, have only cultivated a single species,\r\nthe _Tetragonia_, an insignificant green vegetable. I am aware that Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker[1] has enumerated more than a hundred Australian species\r\nwhich may be used in some way; but as a matter of fact they were not\r\ncultivated by the natives, and, in spite of the improved methods of the\r\nEnglish colonists, no one does cultivate them. This clearly demonstrates\r\nthe principle of which I spoke just now, that the choice of species is\r\nmore important than the selection of varieties, and that there must be\r\nvaluable qualities in a wild plant in order to lead to its cultivation.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the obscurity of the beginnings of cultivation in each\r\nregion, it is certain that they occurred at very different periods. One\r\nof the most ancient examples of cultivated plants is in a drawing\r\nrepresenting figs, found in Egypt in the pyramid of Gizeh. The epoch of\r\nthe construction of this monument is uncertain. Authors have assigned a\r\ndate varying between fifteen hundred and four thousand two hundred years\r\nbefore the Christian era. Supposing it to be two thousand years, its\r\nactual age would be four thousand years. Now, the construction of the\r\npyramids could only have been the work of a numerous, organized people,\r\npossessing a certain degree of civilization, and consequently an\r\nestablished agriculture, dating from some centuries back at least. In\r\nChina, two thousand seven hundred years before Christ, the Emperor\r\nChenming instituted the ceremony at which every year five species of\r\nuseful plants are sown—rice, sweet potato, wheat, and two kinds of\r\nmillet.[2] These plants must have been cultivated for some time in\r\ncertain localities before they attracted the emperor’s attention to such\r\na degree. Agriculture appears, then, to be as ancient in China as in\r\nEgypt. The constant relations between Egypt and Mesopotamia lead us to\r\nsuppose that an almost contemporaneous cultivation existed in the\r\nvalleys of the Euphrates and the Nile. And it may have been equally\r\nearly in India and in the Malay Archipelago. The history of the\r\nDravidian and Malay peoples does not reach far back, and is sufficiently\r\nobscure, but there is no reason to believe that cultivation has not been\r\nknown among them for a very long time, particularly along the banks of\r\nthe rivers.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians and the Phœnicians propagated many plants in the\r\nregion of the Mediterranean, and the Aryan nations, whose migrations\r\ntowards Europe began about 2500, or at latest 2000 years B.C., carried\r\nwith them several species already cultivated in Western Asia. We shall\r\nsee, in studying the history of several species, that some plants were\r\nprobably cultivated in Europe and in the north of Africa prior to the\r\nAryan migration. This is shown by names in languages more ancient than\r\nthe Aryan tongues; for instance, Finn, Basque, Berber, and the speech of\r\nthe Guanchos of the Canary Isles. However, the remains, called\r\nkitchen-middens, of ancient Danish dwellings, have hitherto furnished no\r\nproof of cultivation or any indication of the possession of metal.[3]\r\nThe Scandinavians of that period lived principally by fishing and\r\nhunting, and perhaps eked out their subsistence by indigenous plants,\r\nsuch as the cabbage, the nature of which does not admit any remnant of\r\ntraces in the dung-heaps and rubbish, and which, moreover, did not\r\nrequire cultivation. The absence of metals does not in these northern\r\ncountries argue a greater antiquity than the age of Pericles, or even\r\nthe palmy days of the Roman republic. Later, when bronze was known in\r\nSweden—a region far removed from the then civilized\r\ncountries—agriculture had at length been introduced. Among the remains\r\nof that epoch was found a carving of a cart drawn by two oxen and driven\r\nby a man.[4]\r\n\r\nThe ancient inhabitants of Eastern Switzerland, at a time when they\r\npossessed instruments of polished stone and no metals, cultivated\r\nseveral plants, of which some were of Asiatic origin. Heer[5] has shown,\r\nin his admirable work on the lake-dwellings, that the inhabitants had\r\nintercourse with the countries south of the Alps. They may also have\r\nreceived plants cultivated by the Iberians, who occupied Gaul before the\r\nKelts. At the period when the lake-dwellers of Switzerland and Savoy\r\npossessed bronze, their agriculture was more varied. It seems that the\r\nlake-dwellers of Italy, when in possession of this metal, cultivated\r\nfewer species than those of Savoy,[6] and this may be due either to a\r\ngreater antiquity or to local circumstances. The remains of the\r\nlake-dwellers of Laybach and of the Mondsee in Austria prove likewise a\r\ncompletely primitive agriculture; no cereals have been found at Laybach,\r\nand but a single grain of wheat at the Mondsee.[7] The backward\r\ncondition of agriculture in this eastern part of Europe is contrary to\r\nthe hypothesis, based on a few words used by ancient historians, that\r\nthe Aryans sojourned first in the region of the Danube, and that Thrace\r\nwas civilized before Greece. In spite of this example, agriculture\r\nappears in general to have been more ancient in the temperate parts of\r\nEurope than we should be inclined to believe from the Greeks, who were\r\ndisposed, like certain modern writers, to attribute the origin of all\r\nprogress to their own nation.\r\n\r\nIn America, agriculture is perhaps not quite so ancient as in Asia and\r\nEgypt, if we are to judge from the civilization of Mexico and Peru,\r\nwhich does not date even from the first centuries of the Christian era.\r\nHowever, the widespread cultivation of certain plants, such as maize,\r\ntobacco, and the sweet potato, argues a considerable antiquity, perhaps\r\ntwo thousand years or thereabouts. History is at fault in this matter,\r\nand we can only hope to be enlightened by the discoveries of archæology\r\nand geology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMETHODS FOR DISCOVERING OR PROVING THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _General reflections._ As most cultivated plants have been under\r\nculture from an early period, and the manner of their introduction into\r\ncultivation is often little known, different means are necessary in\r\norder to ascertain their origin. For each species we need a research\r\nsimilar to those made by historians and archæologists—a varied research,\r\nin which sometimes one process is employed, sometimes another; and these\r\nare afterwards combined and estimated according to their relative value.\r\nThe naturalist is here no longer in his ordinary domain of observation\r\nand description; he must support himself by historical proof, which is\r\nnever demanded in the laboratory; and botanical facts are required, not\r\nwith respect to the physiology of plants—a favourite study of the\r\npresent day—but with regard to the distinction of species and their\r\ngeographical distribution.\r\n\r\nI shall, therefore, have to make use of methods of which some are\r\nforeign to naturalists, others to persons versed in historical learning.\r\nI shall say a few words of each, to explain how they should be employed\r\nand what is their value.\r\n\r\n2. _Botany._ One of the most direct means of discovering the\r\ngeographical origin of a cultivated species, is to seek in what country\r\nit grows spontaneously, and without the help of man. The question\r\nappears at the first glance to be a simple one. It seems, indeed, that\r\nby consulting floras, works upon species in general, or herbaria, we\r\nought to be able to solve it easily in each particular case.\r\nUnfortunately it is, on the contrary, a question which demands a special\r\nknowledge of botany, especially of geographical botany, and an estimate\r\nof botanists and of collectors, founded on a long experience. Learned\r\nmen, occupied with history or with the interpretation of ancient\r\nauthors, are liable to grave mistakes when they content themselves with\r\nthe first testimony they may happen to light upon in a botanical work.\r\nOn the other hand, travellers who collect plants for a herbarium are not\r\nalways sufficiently observant of the places and circumstances in which\r\nthey find them. They often neglect to note down what they have remarked\r\non the subject. We know, however, that a plant may have sprung from\r\nothers cultivated in the neighbourhood; that birds, winds, etc., may\r\nhave borne the seeds to great distances; that they are sometimes brought\r\nin the ballast of vessels or mixed with their cargoes. Such cases\r\npresent themselves with respect to common species, much more so with\r\nrespect to cultivated plants which abound near human dwellings. A\r\ncollector or traveller had need be a keen observer to judge if a plant\r\nhas sprung from a wild stock belonging to the flora of the country, or\r\nif it is of foreign origin. When the plant is growing near dwellings, on\r\nwalls, among rubbish-heaps, by the wayside, etc., we should be cautious\r\nin forming an opinion.\r\n\r\nIt may also happen that a plant strays from cultivation, even to a\r\ndistance from suspicious localities, and has nevertheless but a short\r\nduration, because it cannot in the long run support the conditions of\r\nthe climate or the struggle with the indigenous species. This is what is\r\ncalled in botany an _adventive_ species. It appears and disappears, a\r\nproof that it is not a native of the country. Every flora offers\r\nnumerous examples of this kind. When these are more abundant than usual,\r\nthe public is struck by the circumstance. Thus, the troops hastily\r\nsummoned from Algeria into France in 1870, disseminated by fodder and\r\notherwise a number of African and southern species which excited wonder,\r\nbut of which no trace remained after two or three winters.\r\n\r\nSome collectors and authors of floras are very careful in noting these\r\nfacts. Thanks to personal relations with some of them, and to frequent\r\nreferences to their herbaria and botanical works, I flatter myself I am\r\nacquainted with them. I shall, therefore, willingly cite their testimony\r\nin doubtful cases. For certain countries and certain species I have\r\naddressed myself directly to these eminent naturalists. I have appealed\r\nto their memory, to their notes, to their herbaria, and from the answers\r\nthey have been so kind as to return, I have been enabled to add\r\nunpublished documents to those found in works already made public. My\r\nsincere thanks are due for information of this nature received from Mr.\r\nC. B. Clarke on the plants of India, from M. Boissier on those of the\r\nEast, from M. Sagot on the species of French Guiana, from M. Cosson on\r\nthose of Algeria, from MM. Decaisne and Bretschneider on the plants of\r\nChina, from M. Pancic on the cereals of Servia, from Messrs. Bentham and\r\nBaker on the specimens of the herbarium at Kew, lastly from M. Edouard\r\nAndré on the plants of America. This zealous traveller was kind enough\r\nto lend me some most interesting specimens of species cultivated in\r\nSouth America, which he found presenting every appearance of indigenous\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nA more difficult question, and one which cannot be solved at once, is\r\nwhether a plant growing wild, with all the appearance of the indigenous\r\nspecies, has existed in the country from a very early period, or has\r\nbeen introduced at a more or less ancient date.\r\n\r\nFor there are naturalized species, that is, those that are introduced\r\namong the plants of the ancient flora, and which, although of foreign\r\norigin, persist there in such a manner that observation alone cannot\r\ndistinguish them, so that historical records or botanical\r\nconsiderations, whether simple or geographical, are needed for their\r\ndetection. In a very general sense, taking into consideration the\r\nlengthened periods with which science is concerned, nearly all species,\r\nespecially in the regions lying outside the tropics, have been once\r\nnaturalized; that is to say, they have, from geographical and physical\r\ncircumstances, passed from one region to another. When, in 1855, I put\r\nforward the idea that conditions anterior to our epoch determined the\r\ngreater number of the facts of the actual distribution of plants—this\r\nwas the sense of several of the articles, and of the conclusion of my\r\ntwo volumes of geographical botany[8]—it was received with considerable\r\nsurprise. It is true that general considerations of palæontology had\r\njust led Dr. Unger,[9] a German savant, to adopt similar ideas, and\r\nbefore him Edward Forbes had, with regard to some species of the\r\nsouthern counties of the British Isles, suggested the hypothesis of an\r\nancient connection with Spain.[10] But the proof that it is impossible\r\nto explain the habitations of the whole number of present species by\r\nmeans of the conditions existing for some thousands of years, made a\r\ngreater impression, because it belonged more especially to the\r\ndepartment of botanists, and did not relate to only a few plants of a\r\nsingle country. The hypothesis suggested by Forbes became an assured\r\nfact and capable of general application, and is now a truism of science.\r\nAll that is written on geographical or zoological botany rests upon this\r\nbasis, which is no longer contested.\r\n\r\nThis principle, in its application to each country and each species,\r\npresents a number of difficulties; for when a cause is once recognized,\r\nit is not always easy to discover how it has affected each particular\r\ncase. Luckily, so far as cultivated plants are concerned, the questions\r\nwhich occur do not make it necessary to go back to very ancient times,\r\nnor to dates which cannot be defined by a given number of years or\r\ncenturies. No doubt the modern specific forms date from a period earlier\r\nthan the great extension of glaciers in the northern hemisphere—a\r\nphenomenon of several thousand years’ duration, if we are to judge from\r\nthe size of the deposits transported by the ice; but cultivation began\r\nafter this epoch, and even in many instances within historic time. We\r\nhave little to do with previous events. Cultivated species may have\r\nchanged their abode before cultivation, or in the course of a longer\r\ntime they may have changed their form; this belongs to the general study\r\nof all organized life, and we are concerned only with the examination of\r\neach species since its cultivation or in the time immediately before it.\r\nThis is a great simplification.\r\n\r\nThe question of age, thus limited, may be approached by means of\r\nhistorical or other records, of which I shall presently speak, and by\r\nthe principles of geographical botany.\r\n\r\nI shall briefly enumerate these, in order to show in what manner they\r\ncan aid in the discovery of the geographical origin of a given plant.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the abode of each species is constant, or nearly constant. It\r\nis, however, sometimes disconnected; that is to say, that the\r\nindividuals of which it is composed are found in widely separated\r\nregions. These cases, which are extremely interesting in the study of\r\nthe vegetable kingdom and of the surface of the globe, are far from\r\nforming the majority. Therefore, when a cultivated species is found\r\nwild, frequently in Europe, more rarely in the United States, it is\r\nprobable that, in spite of its indigenous appearance in America, it has\r\nbecome naturalized after being accidentally transported thither.\r\n\r\nThe genera of the vegetable kingdom, although usually composed of\r\nseveral species, are often confined to a single region. It follows, that\r\nthe more species included in a genus all belonging to the same quarter\r\nof the globe, the more probable it is that one of the species,\r\napparently indigenous in another part of the world, has been transported\r\nthither and has become naturalized there, by escaping from cultivation.\r\nThis is especially the case with tropical genera, because they are more\r\noften restricted either to the old or to the new world.\r\n\r\nGeographical botany teaches us what countries have genera and even\r\nspecies in common, in spite of a certain distance, and what, on the\r\ncontrary, are very different, in spite of similarity of climate or\r\ninconsiderable distance. It also teaches us what species, genera, and\r\nfamilies are scattered over a wide area, and the more limited extent of\r\nothers. These data are of great assistance in determining the probable\r\norigin of a given species. Naturalized plants spread rapidly. I have\r\nquoted examples elsewhere[11] of instances within the last two\r\ncenturies, and similar facts have been noted from year to year. The\r\nrapidity of the recent invasion of _Anacharis Alsinastrum_ into the\r\nrivers of Europe is well known, and that of many European plants in New\r\nZealand, Australia, California, etc., mentioned in several floras or\r\nmodern travels.\r\n\r\nThe great abundance of a species is no proof of its antiquity. _Agave\r\nAmericana_, so common on the shores of the Mediterranean, although\r\nintroduced from America, and our cardoon, which now covers a great part\r\nof the Pampas of La Plata, are remarkable instances in point. As a rule,\r\nan invading species makes rapid way, while extinction is, on the\r\ncontrary, the result of the strife of several centuries against\r\nunfavourable circumstances.[12]\r\n\r\nThe designation which should be adopted for allied species, or, to speak\r\nscientifically, allied forms, is a problem often presented in natural\r\nhistory, and more often in the category of cultivated species than in\r\nothers. These plants are changed by cultivation. Man adopts new and\r\nconvenient forms, and propagates them by artificial means, such as\r\nbudding, grafting, the choice of seeds, etc. It is clear that, in order\r\nto discover the origin of one of these species, we must eliminate as far\r\nas possible the forms which appear to be artificial, and concentrate our\r\nattention on the others. A simple reflection may guide this choice,\r\nnamely, that a cultivated species varies chiefly in those parts for\r\nwhich it is cultivated. The others remain unmodified, or present\r\ntrifling alterations, of which the cultivator takes no note, because\r\nthey are useless to him. We may expect, therefore, to find the fruit of\r\na wild fruit tree small and of a doubtfully agreeable flavour, the grain\r\nof a cereal in its wild state small, the tubercles of a wild potato\r\nsmall, the leaves of indigenous tobacco narrow, etc., without, however,\r\ngoing so far as to imagine that the species developed rapidly under\r\ncultivation, for man would not have begun to cultivate it if it had not\r\nfrom the beginning presented some useful or agreeable qualities.\r\n\r\nWhen once a cultivated plant has been reduced to such a condition as\r\npermits of its being reasonably compared with analogous spontaneous\r\nforms, we have still to decide what group of nearly similar plants it is\r\nproper to designate as constituting a species. Botanists alone are\r\ncompetent to pronounce an opinion on this question, since they are\r\naccustomed to appreciate differences and resemblances, and know the\r\nconfusion of certain works in the matter of nomenclature. This is not\r\nthe place to discuss what may reasonably be termed a species. I have\r\nstated in some of my articles the principles which seem to me the best.\r\nAs their application would often require a study which has not been\r\nmade, I have thought it well occasionally to treat quasi-specific forms\r\nas a group which appears to me to correspond to a species, and I have\r\nsought the geographical origin of these forms as though they were really\r\nspecific.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: botany furnishes valuable means of guessing or proving the\r\norigin of cultivated plants and for avoiding mistakes. We must, however,\r\nby no means forget that practical observation must be supplemented by\r\nresearch in the study. After gaining information from the collector who\r\nsees the plants in a given spot or district, and who draws up a flora or\r\na catalogue of species, it is indispensable to study the known or\r\nprobable geographical distribution in books and in herbaria, and to\r\nreflect upon the principles of geographical botany and on the questions\r\nof classification, which cannot be done by travelling or collecting.\r\nOther researches, of which I shall speak presently, must be combined\r\nwith those of botany if we would arrive at satisfactory conclusions.\r\n\r\n3. _Archæology and Palæontology._ The most direct proof which can be\r\nconceived of the ancient existence of a species in a given country is to\r\nsee its recognizable fragments in old buildings or deposits, of a more\r\nor less certain date.\r\n\r\nThe fruits, seeds, and different portions of plants taken from ancient\r\nEgyptian tombs, and the drawings which surround them in the pyramids,\r\nhave given rise to most important researches, which I shall often have\r\nto mention. Nevertheless, there is a possible source of error; the\r\nfraudulent introduction of modern plants into the sarcophagi of the\r\nmummies. This was easily discovered in the case of some grains of maize,\r\nfor instance, a plant of American origin, which were introduced by the\r\nArabs; but species cultivated in Egypt within the last two or three\r\nthousand years may have been added, which would thus appear to have\r\nbelonged to an earlier period. The tumuli or mounds of North America,\r\nand the monuments of the ancient Mexicans and Peruvians, have furnished\r\nrecords about the plants cultivated in that part of the world. Here we\r\nare concerned with an epoch subsequent to the pyramids of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of the Swiss lake-dwellings have been the subject of\r\nimportant treatises, among which that of Heer, quoted just now, holds\r\nthe first place. Similar works have been published on the vegetable\r\nremains found in other lakes or peat mosses of Switzerland, Savoy,\r\nGermany, and Italy. I shall quote them with reference to several\r\nspecies. Dr. Gross has been kind enough to send me seeds and fruits\r\ntaken from the lake-dwellings of Neuchâtel; and my colleague, Professor\r\nHeer, has favoured me with several facts collected at Zürich since the\r\npublication of his work. I have already said that the rubbish-heaps of\r\nthe Scandinavian countries, called kitchen-middens, have furnished no\r\ntrace of cultivated vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe tufa of the south of France contains leaves and other remains of\r\nplants, which have been discovered by MM. Martins, Planchon, de Saporta,\r\nand other savants. Their date is not, perhaps, always earlier than that\r\nof the first lacustrine deposits, and it is possible that it agrees with\r\nthat of ancient Egyptian monuments, and of ancient Chinese books.\r\nLastly, the mineralogic strata, with which geologists are specially\r\nconcerned, tell us much about the succession of vegetable forms in\r\ndifferent countries; but here we are dealing with epochs far anterior to\r\nagriculture, and it would be a strange and certainly a most valuable\r\nchance if a modern cultivated species were discovered in the European\r\ntertiary epoch. No such discovery has hitherto been made with any\r\ncertainty, though uncultivated species have been recognized in strata\r\nprior to the glacial epoch of the northern hemisphere. For the rest, if\r\nwe do not succeed in finding them, the consequences will not be clear,\r\nsince it may be said, either that such a plant came at a later date from\r\na different region, or that it had formerly another form which renders\r\nits recognition impossible in a fossil state.\r\n\r\n4. _History._ Historical records are important in order to determine the\r\ndate of certain cultures in each country. They also give indications as\r\nto the geographical origin of plants when they have been propagated by\r\nthe migrations of ancient peoples, by travellers, or by military\r\nexpeditions.\r\n\r\nThe assertions of authors must not, however, be accepted without\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of ancient historians have confused the fact of the\r\ncultivation of a species in a country with that of its previous\r\nexistence there in a wild state. It has been commonly asserted, even in\r\nour own day, that a species cultivated in America or China is a native\r\nof America or China. A no less common error is the belief that a species\r\ncomes originally from a given country because it has come to us from\r\nthence, and not direct from the place in which it is really indigenous.\r\nThus the Greeks and Romans called the peach the Persian apple, because\r\nthey had seen it cultivated in Persia, where it probably did not grow\r\nwild. It was a native of China, as I have elsewhere shown. They called\r\nthe pomegranate, which had spread gradually from garden to garden from\r\nPersia to Mauritania, the apple of Carthage (_Malum Punicum_). Very\r\nancient authors, such as Herodotus and Berosius, are yet more liable to\r\nerror, in spite of their desire to be accurate.\r\n\r\nWe shall see, when we speak of maize, that historical documents which\r\nare complete forgeries may deceive us about the origin of a species. It\r\nis curious, for it seems to be no one’s interest to lie about such\r\nagricultural facts. Fortunately, facts of botany and archæology enable\r\nus to detect errors of this nature.\r\n\r\nThe principal difficulty, which commonly occurs in the case of ancient\r\nhistorians, is to find the exact translation of the names of plants,\r\nwhich in their books always bear the common names. I shall speak\r\npresently of the value of these names and how the science of language\r\nmay be brought to bear on the questions with which we are occupied, but\r\nI must first indicate those historical notions which are most useful in\r\nthe study of cultivated plants.\r\n\r\nAgriculture came originally, at least so far as the principal species\r\nare concerned, from three great regions, in which certain plants grew,\r\nregions which had no communication with each other. These are—China, the\r\nsouth-west of Asia (with Egypt), and intertropical America. I do not\r\nmean to say that in Europe, in Africa, and elsewhere savage tribes may\r\nnot have cultivated a few species locally, at an early epoch, as an\r\naddition to the resources of hunting and fishing; but the great\r\ncivilizations based upon agriculture began in the three regions I have\r\nindicated. It is worthy of note that in the old world agricultural\r\ncommunities established themselves along the banks of the rivers,\r\nwhereas in America they dwelt on the high lands of Mexico and Peru. This\r\nmay perhaps have been due to the original situation of the plants\r\nsuitable for cultivation, for the banks of the Mississippi, of the\r\nAmazon, of the Orinoco, are not more unhealthy than those of the rivers\r\nof the old world.\r\n\r\nA few words about each of the three regions.\r\n\r\nChina had already possessed for some thousands of years a flourishing\r\nagriculture and even horticulture, when she entered for the first time\r\ninto relations with Western Asia, by the mission of Chang-Kien, during\r\nthe reign of the Emperor Wu-ti, in the second century before the\r\nChristian era. The records, known as Pent-sao, written in our Middle\r\nAges, state that he brought back the bean, the cucumber, the lucern, the\r\nsaffron, the sesame, the walnut, the pea, spinach, the water-melon, and\r\nother western plants,[13] then unknown to the Chinese. Chang-Kien, it\r\nwill be observed, was no ordinary ambassador. He considerably enlarged\r\nthe geographical knowledge, and improved the economic condition of his\r\ncountrymen. It is true that he was constrained to dwell ten years in the\r\nWest, and that he belonged to an already civilized people, one of whose\r\nemperors had, 2700 B.C., consecrated with imposing ceremonies the\r\ncultivation of certain plants. The Mongolians were too barbarous, and\r\ncame from too cold a country, to have been able to introduce many useful\r\nspecies into China; but when we consider the origin of the peach and the\r\napricot, we shall see that these plants were brought into China from\r\nWestern Asia, probably by isolated travellers, merchants or others, who\r\npassed north of the Himalayas. A few species spread in the same way into\r\nChina from the West before the embassy of Chang-Kien.\r\n\r\nRegular communication between China and India only began in the time of\r\nChang-Kien, and by the circuitous way of Bactriana;[14] but gradual\r\ntransmissions from place to place may have been effected through the\r\nMalay Peninsula and Cochin-China. The writers of Northern China may have\r\nbeen ignorant of them, and especially since the southern provinces were\r\nonly united to the empire in the second century before Christ.[15]\r\n\r\nRegular communications between China and Japan only took place about the\r\nyear 57 of our era, when an ambassador was sent; and the Chinese had no\r\nreal knowledge of their eastern neighbours until the third century, when\r\nthe Chinese character was introduced into Japan.[16]\r\n\r\nThe vast region which stretches from the Ganges to Armenia and the Nile\r\nwas not in ancient times so isolated as China. Its inhabitants exchanged\r\ncultivated plants with great facility, and even transported them to a\r\ndistance. It is enough to remember that ancient migrations and conquests\r\ncontinually intermixed the Turanian, Aryan, and Semitic peoples between\r\nthe Caspian Sea, Mesopotamia, and the Nile. Great states were formed\r\nnearly at the same time on the banks of the Euphrates and in Egypt, but\r\nthey succeeded to tribes which had already cultivated certain plants.\r\nAgriculture is older in that region than Babylon and the first Egyptian\r\ndynasties, which date from more than four thousand years ago. The\r\nAssyrian and Egyptian empires afterwards fought for supremacy, and in\r\ntheir struggles they transported whole nations, which could not fail to\r\nspread cultivated species. On the other hand, the Aryan tribes who dwelt\r\noriginally to the north of Mesopotamia, in a land less favourable to\r\nagriculture, spread westward and southward, driving out or subjugating\r\nthe Turanian and Dravidian nations. Their speech, and those which are\r\nderived from it in Europe and Hindustan, show that they knew and\r\ntransported several useful species.[17] After these ancient events, of\r\nwhich the dates are for the most part uncertain, the voyages of the\r\nPhœnicians, the wars between the Greeks and Persians, Alexander’s\r\nexpedition into India, and finally the Roman rule, completed the spread\r\nof cultivation in the interior of Western Asia, and even introduced it\r\ninto Europe and the north of Africa, wherever the climate permitted.\r\n\r\nLater, at the time of the crusades, very few useful plants yet remained\r\nto be brought from the East. A few varieties of fruit trees which the\r\nRomans did not possess, and some ornamental plants, were, however, then\r\nbrought to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America in 1492 was the last great event which caused\r\nthe diffusion of cultivated plants into all countries. The American\r\nspecies, such as the potato, maize, the prickly pear, tobacco, etc.,\r\nwere first imported into Europe and Asia. Then a number of species from\r\nthe old world were introduced into America. The voyage of Magellan\r\n(1520-1521) was the first direct communication between South America and\r\nAsia. In the same century the slave trade multiplied communications\r\nbetween Africa and America. Lastly, the discovery of the Pacific Islands\r\nin the eighteenth century, and the growing facility of the means of\r\ncommunication, combined with a general idea of improvement, produced\r\nthat more general dispersion of useful plants of which we are witnesses\r\nat the present day.\r\n\r\n5. _Philology._ The common names of cultivated plants are usually well\r\nknown, and may afford indications touching the history of a species, but\r\nthere are examples in which they are absurd, based upon errors, or vague\r\nand doubtful, and this involves a certain caution in their use.\r\n\r\nI could quote a number of such names in all languages; it is enough to\r\nmention, in French, _blé de Turquie_, maize, a plant which is not a\r\nwheat, and which comes from America; in English, Jerusalem artichoke\r\n(_Helianthus tuberosus_), which does not come from Jerusalem, but from\r\nNorth America, and is no artichoke.\r\n\r\nA number of names given to foreign plants by Europeans when they are\r\nsettled in the colonies, express false or insignificant analogies. For\r\ninstance, the _New Zealand flax_ resembles the true flax as little as\r\npossible; it is merely that a textile substance is obtained from its\r\nleaves. The _mahogany apple_ (cashew) of the French West India Isles is\r\nnot an apple, nor even the fruit of a pomaceous tree, and has nothing to\r\ndo with mahogany.\r\n\r\nSometimes the common names have changed, in passing from one language to\r\nanother, in such a manner as to give a false or absurd meaning. Thus the\r\ntree of Judea of the French (_Cercis Siliquastrum_) has become the\r\nJudas tree in English. The fruit called by the Mexicans _ahuaca_, is\r\nbecome the _avocat_ (lawyer) of the French colonists.\r\n\r\nNot unfrequently names of plants have been taken by the same people at\r\nsuccessive epochs or in different provinces, sometimes as generic,\r\nsometimes as specific names. The French word _blé_, for instance, may\r\nmean several species of the genus Triticum, and even of very different\r\nnutritious plants (maize and wheat), or a given species of wheat.\r\n\r\nSeveral common names have been transferred from one plant to another\r\nthrough error or ignorance. Thus the confusion made by early travellers\r\nbetween the sweet potato (_Convolvulus Batatas_) and the potato\r\n(_Solanum tuberosum_) has caused the latter to be called potato in\r\nEnglish and _patatas_ in Spanish.\r\n\r\nIf modern, civilized peoples, who have great facilities for comparing\r\nspecies, learning their origin and verifying their names in books, have\r\nmade such mistakes, it is probable that ancient nations have made many\r\nand more grave errors. Scholars display vast learning in explaining the\r\nphilological origin of a name, or its modifications in derived\r\nlanguages, but they cannot discover popular errors or absurdities. It is\r\nleft for botanists to discover and point them out. We may note, in\r\npassing, that the double or compound names are the most doubtful. They\r\nmay consist of two mistakes; one in the root or principal name, the\r\nother in the addition or accessory name, destined almost always to\r\nindicate the geographical origin, some visible quality, or some\r\ncomparison with other species. The shorter a name is, the better it\r\nmerits consideration in questions of origin or antiquity; for it is by\r\nthe succession of years, of the migrations of peoples, and of the\r\ntransport of plants, that the addition of often erroneous epithets takes\r\nplace. Similarly, in symbolic writing, like that of the Chinese and the\r\nEgyptians, unique and simple signs indicate long-known species, not\r\nimported from foreign countries, while complicated signs are doubtful or\r\nindicate a foreign origin. We must not forget, however, that the signs\r\nhave often been rebuses, based on chance resemblances in the words, or\r\non superstitious and fanciful ideas.\r\n\r\nThe identity of a common name for a given species in several languages\r\nmay have two very different explanations. It may be because a plant has\r\nbeen spread by a people which has been dispersed and scattered. It may\r\nalso result from the transmission of a plant from one people to another\r\nwith the name it bore in its original home. The first case is that of\r\nthe hemp, of which the name is similar, at least as to the root, in all\r\nthe tongues derived from the primitive Aryan stock. The second is seen\r\nin the American name of tobacco, the Chinese of tea, which have spread\r\ninto a number of countries, without any philological or ethnographic\r\nfiliation. This case has occurred oftener in modern than in ancient\r\ntimes, because the rapidity of communications allows of the simultaneous\r\nintroduction of a plant and of its name, even where the distance is\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nThe diversity of names for the same species may also spring from various\r\ncauses. As a rule, it indicates an early existence in different\r\ncountries, but it may also arise from the mixture of races, or from\r\nnames of varieties which take the place of the original name. Thus in\r\nEngland we find, according to the county, a Keltic, Saxon, Danish, or\r\nLatin name; and flax bears in Germany the names of _flachs_ and _lein_,\r\nwords which are evidently of different origin.\r\n\r\nWhen we desire to make use of the common names to gather from them\r\ncertain probabilities regarding the origin of species, it is necessary\r\nto consult dictionaries and the dissertations of philologists; but we\r\nmust take into account the chances of error in these learned men, who,\r\nsince they are neither cultivators nor botanists, may have made mistakes\r\nin the application of a name to a species.\r\n\r\nThe most considerable collection of common names is that of Nemnich,\r\npublished in 1793.[18] I have another in manuscript which is yet more\r\ncomplete, drawn up in our library by an old pupil of mine, Moritzi, by\r\nmeans of floras and of several books of travel written by botanists.\r\nThere are, besides, dictionaries of the names of the species in given\r\ncountries or in some special language. This kind of glossary does not\r\noften contain explanations of etymology; but in spite of what Hehn[19]\r\nmay say, a naturalist possessed of an ordinary general education can\r\nrecognize the connection or the fundamental differences between certain\r\nnames in different languages, and need not confound modern with ancient\r\nlanguages. It is not necessary to be initiated into the mysteries of\r\nsuffixes or affixes, of dentals and labials. No doubt the researches of\r\na philologist into etymologies are more profound and valuable, but this\r\nis rarely necessary when our researches have to do with cultivated\r\nplants. Other sciences are more useful, especially that of botany; and\r\nphilologists are more often deficient in these than naturalists are\r\ndeficient in philology, for the very evident reason that more place is\r\ngiven to languages than to natural history in general education. It\r\nappears to me, moreover, that philologists, notably those who are\r\noccupied with Sanskrit, are always too eager to find the etymology of\r\nevery name. They do not allow sufficiently for human stupidity, which\r\nhas in all time given rise to absurd words, without any real basis, and\r\nderived only from error or superstition.\r\n\r\nThe filiation of modern European tongues is known to every one. That of\r\nancient languages has, for more than half a century, been the object of\r\nimportant labours. Of these I cannot here give even a brief notice. It\r\nis sufficient to recall that all modern European languages are derived\r\nfrom the speech of the Western Aryans, who came from Asia, with the\r\nexception of Basque (derived from the Iberian language), Finnish,\r\nTurkish, and Hungarian, into which, moreover, words of Aryan origin have\r\nbeen introduced. On the other hand, several modern languages of India,\r\nCeylon, and Java, are derived from the Sanskrit of the Eastern Aryans,\r\nwho left Central Asia after the Western Aryans. It is supposed, with\r\nsufficient probability, that the first Western Aryans came into Europe\r\n2500 B.C., and the Eastern Aryans into India a thousand years later.\r\n\r\nBasque (or Iberian), the speech of the Guanchos of the Canary Isles, of\r\nwhich a few plant names are known, and Berber, are probably connected\r\nwith the ancient tongues of the north of Africa.\r\n\r\nBotanists are in many cases forced to doubt the common names attributed\r\nto plants by travellers, historians, and philologists. This is a\r\nconsequence of their own doubts respecting the distinction of species\r\nand of the well-known difficulty of ascertaining the common name of a\r\nplant. The uncertainty becomes yet greater in the case of species which\r\nare more easily confounded or less generally known, or in the case of\r\nthe languages of little-civilized nations. There are, so to speak,\r\ndegrees of languages in this respect, and the names should be accepted\r\nmore or less readily according to these degrees.\r\n\r\nIn the first rank, for certainty, are placed those languages which\r\npossess botanical works. For instance, it is possible to recognize a\r\nspecies by means of a Greek description by Dioscorides or Theophrastus,\r\nand by the less complete Latin texts of Cato, Columella, or Pliny.\r\nChinese books also give descriptions. Dr. Bretschneider, of the Russian\r\nlegation at Pekin, has written some excellent papers upon these books,\r\nfrom which I shall often quote.[20]\r\n\r\nThe second degree is that of languages possessing a literature composed\r\nonly of theological and poetical works, or of chronicles of kings and\r\nbattles. Such works make mention here and there of plants, with epithets\r\nor reflections on their mode of flowering, their ripening, their use,\r\netc., which allow their names to be divined, and to be referred to\r\nmodern botanical nomenclature. With the added help of a knowledge of the\r\nflora of the country, and of the common names in the languages derived\r\nfrom the dead language, it is possible to discover approximately the\r\nsense of some words. This is the case with Sanskrit,[21] Hebrew,[22] and\r\nArmenian.[23]\r\n\r\nLastly, a third category of dead languages offers no certainty, but\r\nmerely presumptions or hypothetical and rare indications. It comprehends\r\nthose tongues in which there is no written work, such as Keltic, with\r\nits dialects, the ancient Sclavonic, Pelasgic, Iberian, the speech of\r\nthe primitive Aryans, Turanians, etc. It is possible to guess certain\r\nnames or their approximate form in these dead languages by two methods,\r\nboth of which should be employed with caution.\r\n\r\nThe first and best is to consult the languages derived, or which we\r\nbelieve to be derived, directly from the ancient tongues, as Basque for\r\nthe Iberian language, Albanian for the Pelasgic, Breton, Erse, and\r\nGaelic for Keltic. The danger lies in the possibility of mistake in the\r\nfiliation of the languages, and especially in a mistaken belief in the\r\nantiquity of a plant-name which may have been introduced by another\r\npeople. Thus the Basque language contains many words which seem to have\r\nbeen taken from the Latin at the time of the Roman rule. Berber is full\r\nof Arab words, and Persian of words of every origin, which probably did\r\nnot exist in Zend.\r\n\r\nThe other method consists in reconstructing a dead language which had no\r\nliterature, by means of those which are derived from it; for instance,\r\nthe speech of the Western Aryans, by means of the words common to\r\nseveral European languages which have sprung from it. Fick’s dictionary\r\nwill hardly serve for the words of ancient Aryan languages, for he gives\r\nbut few plant-names, and his arrangement renders it unintelligible to\r\nthose who have no knowledge of Sanskrit. Adolphe Pictet’s work[24] is\r\nfar more important to naturalists, and a second edition, augmented and\r\nimproved, has been published since the author’s death. Plant-names and\r\nagricultural terms are explained and discussed in this work, in a manner\r\nall the more satisfactory that an accurate knowledge of botany is\r\ncombined with philology. If the author attributes perhaps too much\r\nimportance to doubtful etymologies, he makes up for it by other\r\nknowledge, and by his excellent method and lucidity.\r\n\r\nThe plant-names of the Euskarian or Basque language have been considered\r\nfrom the point of view of their probable etymology by the Comte de\r\nCharencey, in _Les Actes de la Société Philologique_ (vol. i. No. 1,\r\n1869). I shall have occasion to quote this work, of which the\r\ndifficulties were great, in the absence of all literature and of all\r\nderived languages.\r\n\r\n6. _The necessity for combining the different methods._ The various\r\nmethods of which I have spoken are of unequal value. It is clear that\r\nwhen we have archæological records about a given species, like those of\r\nthe Egyptian monuments, or of the Swiss lake-dwellings, these are facts\r\nof remarkable accuracy. Then come the data furnished by botany,\r\nespecially those on the spontaneous existence of a species in a given\r\ncountry. These, if examined with care, may be very important. The\r\nassertions contained in the works of historians or even of naturalists\r\nrespecting an epoch at which science was only beginning, have not the\r\nsame value. Lastly, the common names are only an accessory means,\r\nespecially in modern languages, and a means which, as we have seen, is\r\nnot entirely trustworthy. So much may be said in a general way, but\r\nin each particular case one method or the other may be more or less\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nEach can only lead to probabilities, since we are dealing with facts of\r\nancient date which are beyond the reach of direct and actual\r\nobservation. Fortunately, if the same probability is attained in three\r\nor four different ways, we approach very near to certainty. The same\r\nrule holds good for researches into the history of plants as for\r\nresearches into the history of nations. A good author consults\r\nhistorians who have spoken of events, the archives in which unpublished\r\ndocuments are found, the inscriptions on ancient monuments, the\r\nnewspapers, private letters, finally memoirs and even tradition. He\r\ngathers probabilities from every source, and then compares these\r\nprobabilities, weighs and discusses them before deciding. It is a labour\r\nof the mind which requires intelligence and judgment. This labour\r\ndiffers widely from observation employed in natural history, and from\r\npure reason which is proper to the exact sciences. Nevertheless, when,\r\nby several methods, we reach the same probability, I repeat that the\r\nlatter is very nearly a certainty. We may even say that it is as much a\r\ncertainty as historical science can pretend to attain.\r\n\r\nI have the proof of this when I compare my present work with that which\r\nI composed by the same methods in 1855. For the species which I then\r\nstudied, I have now more authorities and better authenticated facts, but\r\nmy conclusions on the origin of each species have scarcely altered. As\r\nthey were already based on a combination of methods, probabilities have\r\nusually become certainties, and I have not been led to conclusions\r\nabsolutely contrary to those previously formed.\r\n\r\nArchæological, philological, and botanical data become more and more\r\nnumerous. By their means the history of cultivated plants is perfected,\r\nwhile the assertions of ancient authors lose instead of gaining in\r\nimportance. From the discoveries of antiquaries and philologists,\r\nmoderns are better acquainted than the Greeks with Chaldea and ancient\r\nEgypt. They can prove mistakes in Herodotus. Botanists on their side\r\ncorrect Theophrastus, Dioscorides, and Pliny from their knowledge of the\r\nflora of Greece and Italy, while the study of classical authors to which\r\nlearned men have applied themselves for three centuries has already\r\nfurnished all that it has to give. I cannot help smiling when, at the\r\npresent day, savants repeat well-known Greek and Latin phrases, and draw\r\nfrom them what they call conclusions. It is trying to extract juice from\r\na lemon which has already been repeatedly squeezed. We must say it\r\nfrankly, the works which repeat and commentate on the ancient authors of\r\nGreece and Rome without giving the first place to botanical and\r\narchæological facts, are no longer on a level with the science of the\r\nday. Nevertheless, I could name several German works which have attained\r\nto the honour of a third edition. It would have been better to reprint\r\nthe earlier publications of Fraas and Lenz, of Targioni and Heldreich,\r\nwhich have always given more weight to the modern data of botany, than\r\nto the vague descriptions of classic authors; that is to say, to facts\r\nthan to words and phrases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n   On the Study of Species, considered as to their Origin, their\r\n   early Cultivation, and the Principal Facts of their\r\n   Diffusion.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPLANTS CULTIVATED FOR THEIR SUBTERRANEAN PARTS, SUCH AS ROOTS,\r\nTUBERCLES, OR BULBS.[26]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Radish.+—_Raphanus sativus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe radish is cultivated for what is called the root, which is, properly\r\nspeaking, the lower part of the stem with the tap root.[27] Every one\r\nknows how the size, shape, and colour of those organs which become\r\nfleshy vary according to the soil or the variety.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the species is indigenous in the temperate\r\nregions of the old world; but, as it has been cultivated in gardens from\r\nthe earliest historic times, from China and Japan to Europe, and as it\r\nsows itself frequently round cultivated plots, it is difficult to fix\r\nupon its starting-point.\r\n\r\nFormerly _Raphanus sativus_ was confounded with kindred species of the\r\nMediterranean region, to which certain Greek names were attributed; but\r\nGay, the botanist, who has done a good deal towards eliminating these\r\nanalogous forms,[28] considered _R. sativus_ as a native of the East,\r\nperhaps of China. Linnæus also supposed this plant to be of Chinese\r\norigin, or at least that variety which is cultivated in China for the\r\nsake of extracting oil from the seeds.[29] Several floras of the south\r\nof Europe mention the species as subspontaneous or escaped from\r\ncultivation, never as spontaneous. Ledebour had seen a specimen found\r\nnear Mount Ararat, had sown the seeds of it and verified the\r\nspecies.[30] However, Boissier,[31] in 1867, in his _Eastern Flora_,\r\nsays that it is only subspontaneous in the cultivated parts of Anatolia,\r\nnear Mersivan (according to Wied), in Palestine (on his own authority),\r\nin Armenia (according to Ledebour), and probably elsewhere, which agrees\r\nwith the assertions found in European floras.[32] Buhse names a\r\nlocality, the Ssahend mountains, to the south of the Caucasus, which\r\nappears to be far enough from cultivation. The recent _Flora of British\r\nIndia_[33] and the earlier _Flora of Cochin-China_ by Loureiro, mention\r\nthe radish only as a cultivated species. Maximowicz saw it in a garden\r\nin the north-east of China.[34] Thunberg speaks of it as a plant of\r\ngeneral cultivation in Japan, and growing also by the side of the\r\nroads,[35] but the latter fact is not repeated by modern authors, who\r\nare probably better informed.[36]\r\n\r\nHerodotus (_Hist._, 1. 2, c. 125) speaks of a radish which he calls\r\n_surmaia_, used by the builders of the pyramid of Cheops, according to\r\nan inscription upon the monument. Unger[37] copied from Lepsius’ work\r\ntwo drawings from the temple of Karnak, of which the first, at any rate,\r\nappears to represent the radish.\r\n\r\nFrom all this we gather, first, that the species spreads easily from\r\ncultivation in the west of Asia and the south of Europe, while it does\r\nnot appear with certainty in the flora of Eastern Asia; and secondly,\r\nthat in the regions south of the Caucasus it is found without any sign\r\nof culture, so that we are led to suppose that the plant is wild there.\r\nFrom these two reasons it appears to have come originally from Western\r\nAsia between Palestine, Anatolia, and the Caucasus, perhaps also from\r\nGreece; its cultivation spreading east and west from a very early\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe common names support these hypotheses. In Europe they offer little\r\ninterest when they refer to the quality of the root (_radis_), or to\r\nsome comparison with the turnip (_ravanello_ in Italian, _rabica_ in\r\nSpanish, etc.), but the ancient Greeks coined the special name\r\n_raphanos_ (easily reared). The Italian word _ramoraccio_ is derived\r\nfrom the Greek _armoracia_, which was used for _R. sativus_ or some\r\nallied species. Modern interpreters have erroneously referred this name\r\nto _Cochlearia Armoracia_ or horse-radish, which I shall come to\r\npresently. Semitic[38] languages have quite different names (_fugla_ in\r\nHebrew, _fuil_, _fidgel_, _figl_, etc., in Arab.). In India, according\r\nto Roxburgh,[39] the common name of a variety with an enormous root, as\r\nlarge sometimes as a man’s leg, is _moola_ or _moolee_, in Sanskrit\r\n_mooluka_. Lastly, for Cochin-China, China, and Japan, authors give\r\nvarious names which differ very much one from the other. From this\r\ndiversity a cultivation which ranged from Greece to Japan must be very\r\nancient, but nothing can thence be concluded as to its original home as\r\na spontaneous plant.\r\n\r\nA totally different opinion exists on the latter point, which we must\r\nalso examine. Several botanists[40] suspect that _Raphanus sativus_ is\r\nsimply a particular condition, with enlarged root and non-articulated\r\nfruit, of _Raphanus raphanistrum_, a very common plant in the temperate\r\ncultivated districts of Europe and Asia, and which is also found in a\r\nwild state in sand and light soil near the sea—for instance, at St.\r\nSebastian, in Dalmatia, and at Trebizond.[41] Its usual haunts are in\r\ndeserted fields; and many common names which signify wild radish, show\r\nthe affinity of the two plants. I should not insist upon this point if\r\ntheir supposed identity were a mere presumption, but it rests upon\r\nexperiments and observations which it is important to know.\r\n\r\nIn _R. raphanistrum_ the siliqua is articulated, that is to say,\r\ncontracted at intervals, and the seeds placed each in a division. In _R.\r\nsativus_ the siliqua is continuous, and forms a single cavity. Some\r\nbotanists had made this difference the basis of two distinct genera,\r\n_Raphanistrum_ and _Raphanus_. But three accurate observers, Webb, Gay,\r\nand Spach, have noticed among plants of _Raphanus sativus_, raised from\r\nthe same seed, both unilocular and articulated pods, some of them\r\nbilocular, others plurilocular. Webb[42] arrived at the same results\r\nwhen he afterwards repeated these experiments, and he observed yet\r\nanother fact of some importance: the radish which sows itself by chance,\r\nand is not cultivated, produced the siliquæ of _Raphanistrum_.[43]\r\nAnother difference between the two plants is in the root, fleshy in _R.\r\nsativus_, slender in _R. raphanistrum_; but this changes with\r\ncultivation, as appears from the experiments of Carrière, the head\r\ngardener of the nurseries of the Natural History Museum in Paris.[44] It\r\noccurred to him to sow the seeds of the slender-rooted _Raphanistrum_ in\r\nboth stiff and light soil, and in the fourth generation he obtained\r\nfleshy radishes, of varied colour and form like those of our gardens. He\r\neven gives the figures, which are really curious and conclusive. The\r\npungent taste of the radish was not wanting. To obtain these changes,\r\nCarrière sowed in September, so as to make the plant almost biennial\r\ninstead of annual. The thickening of the root was the natural result,\r\nsince many biennial plants have fleshy roots.\r\n\r\nThe inverse experiment remains to be tried—to sow cultivated radishes in\r\na poor soil. Probably the roots would become poorer and poorer, while\r\nthe siliquæ would become more and more articulated.\r\n\r\nFrom all the experiments I have mentioned, _Raphanus sativus_ might well\r\nbe a variety of _R. raphanistrum_, an unstable variety determined by the\r\nexistence of several generations in a fertile soil. We cannot suppose\r\nthat ancient uncivilized peoples made essays like those of Carrière, but\r\nthey may have noticed plants of _Raphanistrum_ grown in richly manured\r\nsoil, with more or less fleshy roots; and this soon suggested the idea\r\nof cultivating them.\r\n\r\nI have, however, one objection to make, founded on geographical botany.\r\n_Raphanus raphanistrum_ is a European plant which does not exist in\r\nAsia.[45] It cannot, therefore, be this species that has furnished the\r\ninhabitants of India, China, and Japan with the radishes which they have\r\ncultivated for centuries. On the other hand, how could _R.\r\nraphanistrum_, which is supposed to have been modified in Europe, have\r\nbeen transmitted in ancient times across the whole of Asia? The\r\ntransport of cultivated plants has commonly proceeded from Asia into\r\nEurope. Chang-Kien certainly brought vegetables from Bactriana into\r\nChina in the second century B.C., but the radish is not named among the\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Horse-radish+—_Cochlearia Armoracia_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis Crucifer, whose rather hard root has the taste of mustard, was\r\nsometimes called in French _cran_, or _cranson de Bretagne_. This was an\r\nerror caused by the old botanical name _Armoracia_, which was taken for\r\na corruption of _Armorica_ (Brittany). _Armoracia_ occurs in Pliny, and\r\nwas applied to a crucifer of the Pontine province, which was perhaps\r\n_Raphanus sativus._ After I had formerly[46] pointed out this confusion,\r\nI expressed myself as follows on the mistaken origin of the\r\nspecies:—_Cochlearia Armoracia_ is not wild in Brittany, a fact now\r\nestablished by the researches of botanists in the west of France. The\r\nAbbé Delalande mentions it in his little work, entitled _Hœdic et\r\nHouat_,[47] in which he gives so interesting an account of the customs\r\nand productions of these two little islands of Brittany. He quotes the\r\nopinion of M. le Gall, who, in an unpublished flora of Morbihan,\r\ndeclares the plant foreign to Brittany. This proof, however, is less\r\nstrong than others, since the south coast of the peninsula of Brittany\r\nis not yet sufficiently known to botanists, and the ancient Armorica\r\nextended over a portion of Normandy where the wild horse-radish is now\r\nfound.[48] This leads me to speak of the original home of the species.\r\nEnglish botanists mention it as wild in Great Britain, but are doubtful\r\nabout its origin. Watson[49] considers it as introduced by cultivation.\r\nThe difficulty of extirpating it, he says, from places where it is\r\ncultivated, is well known to gardeners. It is therefore not surprising\r\nthat this plant should take possession of waste ground, and persist\r\nthere so as to appear indigenous. Babington[50] mentions only one spot\r\nwhere the species appears to be really wild, namely, Swansea. We will\r\ntry to solve the problem by further arguments.\r\n\r\n_Cochlearia Armoracia_ is a plant belonging to the temperate, and\r\nespecially to the eastern regions of Europe. It is diffused from Finland\r\nto Astrakhan, and to the desert of Cuman.[51] Grisebach mentions also\r\nseveral localities in Turkey in Europe, near Enos, for instance, where\r\nit abounds on the sea-shore.[52]\r\n\r\nThe further we advance towards the west of Europe, the less the authors\r\nof floras appear sure that the plant is indigenous, and the localities\r\nassigned to it are more scattered and doubtful. The species is rarer in\r\nNorway than in Sweden,[53] in the British Isles than in Holland, where a\r\nforeign origin is not attributed to it.[54]\r\n\r\nThe specific names confirm the impression of its origin in the east\r\nrather than in the west of Europe; thus the name _chren_[55] in Russia\r\nrecurs in all the Sclavonic languages, _krenai_ in Lithuanian, _chren_\r\nin Illyrian,[56] etc. It has introduced itself into a few German\r\ndialects, round Vienna,[57] for instance, where it persists, in spite of\r\nthe spread of the German tongue. We owe to it also the French names\r\n_cran_ or _cranson_. The word used in Germany, _Meerretig_, and in\r\nHolland, _meer-radys_, whence the Italian Swiss dialect has taken the\r\nname _méridi_, or _mérédi_, means sea-radish, and is not primitive like\r\nthe word _chren_. It comes probably from the fact that the plant grows\r\nwell near the sea, a circumstance common to many of the _Cruciferæ_, and\r\nwhich should be the case with this species, for it is wild in the east\r\nof Russia where there is a good deal of salt soil. The Swedish name\r\n_peppar-rot_[58] suggests the idea that the species came into Sweden\r\nlater than the introduction of pepper by commerce into the north of\r\nEurope. However, the name may have taken the place of an older one,\r\nwhich has remained unknown to us. The English name of horse-radish is\r\nnot of such an original nature as to lead to a belief in the existence\r\nof the species in the country before the Saxon conquest. It means a very\r\nstrong radish. The Welsh name _rhuddygl maurth_[59] is only the\r\ntranslation of the English word, whence we may infer that the Kelts of\r\nGreat Britain had no special name, and were not acquainted with the\r\nspecies. In the west of France, the name _raifort_, which is the\r\ncommonest, merely means strong root. Formerly it bore in France the\r\nnames of German, or Capuchin mustard, which shows a foreign and recent\r\norigin. On the contrary, the word _chren_ is in all the Sclavonic\r\nlanguages, a word which has penetrated into some German and French\r\ndialects under the forms of _kreen_, _cran_, and _cranson_, and which is\r\ncertainly of a primitive nature, and shows the antiquity of the species\r\nin temperate Eastern Europe. It is therefore most probable that\r\ncultivation has propagated and naturalized the plant westward from the\r\neast for about a thousand years.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Turnips+—_Brassica species et varietates radice in crassata._\r\n\r\nThe innumerable varieties and sub-varieties of the turnip known as\r\nswedes, Kohl-rabi, etc., may be all attributed to one of the four\r\nspecies of Linnæus—_Brassica napus_, _Br. oleracea_, _Br. rapa_, _Br.\r\ncampestris_—of which the two last should, according to modern authors,\r\nbe fused into one. Other varieties of the species are cultivated for the\r\nleaves (cabbages), for the inflorescence (cauliflowers), or for the oil\r\nwhich is extracted from the seed (colza, rape, etc.). When the root or\r\nthe lower part of the stem[60] is fleshy, the seed is not abundant, nor\r\nworth the trouble of extracting the oil; when those organs are slender,\r\nthe production of the seed, on the contrary, becomes more important, and\r\ndecides the economic use of the plant. In other words, the store of\r\nnutritious matter is placed sometimes in the lower, sometimes in the\r\nupper part of the plant, although the organization of the flower and\r\nfruit is similar, or nearly so.\r\n\r\nTouching the question of origin, we need not occupy ourselves with the\r\nbotanical limits of the species, and with the classification of the\r\nraces, varieties, and sub-varieties,[61] since all the _Brassicæ_ are of\r\nEuropean and Siberian origin, and are still to be seen in these regions\r\nwild, or half wild, in some form or other.\r\n\r\nPlants so commonly cultivated and whose germination is so easy often\r\nspread round cultivated places; hence some uncertainty regarding the\r\nreally wild nature of the plants found in the open country.\r\nNevertheless, Linnæus mentions that _Brassica napus_ grows in the sand\r\non the sea-coast in Sweden (Gothland), Holland, and England, which is\r\nconfirmed, as far as Sweden is concerned, by Fries,[62] who, with his\r\nusual attention to questions of this nature, mentions _Br. Campestris_,\r\nL. (type of the _Rapa_ with slender roots), as really wild in the whole\r\nScandinavian peninsula, in Finland and Denmark. Ledebour[63] indicates\r\nit in the whole of Russia, Siberia, and the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\nThe floras of temperate and southern Asia mention rapes and turnips as\r\ncultivated plants, never as escaped from cultivation.[64] This is\r\nalready an indication of foreign origin. The evidence of philology is no\r\nless significant.\r\n\r\nThere is no Sanskrit name for these plants, but only modern Hindu and\r\nBengalee names, and those only for _Brassica rapa_ and _B.\r\noleracea_.[65] Kæmpfer[66] gives Japanese names for the turnip—_busei_,\r\nor more commonly _aona_—but there is nothing to show that these names\r\nare ancient. Bretschneider, who has made a careful study of Chinese\r\nauthors, mentions no _Brassica_. Apparently they do not occur in any of\r\nthe ancient works on botany and agriculture, although several varieties\r\nare now cultivated in China.\r\n\r\nIt is just the reverse in Europe. The old languages have a number of\r\nnames which seem to be original. _Brassica rapa_ is called _meipen_ or\r\n_erfinen_[67] in Wales; _repa_ and _rippa_ in several Slav tongues,[68]\r\nwhich answers to the Latin _rapa_, and is allied to the _neipa_ of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons. The _Brassica napus_ is in Welsh _bresych yr yd_; in Erse\r\n_braisscagh buigh_, according to Threlkeld,[69] who sees in _braisscagh_\r\nthe root of the Latin _Brassica_. A Polish name, _karpiele_, a\r\nLithuanian, _jellazoji_,[70] are also given, without speaking of a host\r\nof other names, transferred sometimes in popular speech from one\r\nspecies to another. I shall speak of the names of _Brassica oleracea_\r\nwhen I come to vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrews had no names for cabbages, rapes, and turnips,[71] but there\r\nare Arab names: _selgam_ for the _Br. napus_, and _subjum_ or _subjumi_\r\nfor _Br. rapa_; words which recur in Persian and even in Bengali,\r\ntransferred perhaps from one species to another. The cultivation of\r\nthese plants has therefore been diffused in the south-west of Asia since\r\nHebrew antiquity.\r\n\r\nFinally, every method, whether botanical, historical, or philological,\r\nleads us to the following conclusions:—\r\n\r\nFirstly, the _Brassicæ_ with fleshy roots were originally natives of\r\ntemperate Europe.\r\n\r\nSecondly, their cultivation was diffused in Europe before, and in Asia\r\nafter, the Aryan invasion.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the primitive slender-rooted form of _Brassica napus_, called\r\n_Br. campestris_, had probably from the beginning a more extended range,\r\nfrom the Scandinavian peninsula towards Siberia and the Caucasus. Its\r\ncultivation was perhaps introduced into China and Japan, through\r\nSiberia, at an epoch which appears not to be much earlier than\r\nGreco-Roman civilization.\r\n\r\nFourthly, the cultivation of the various forms or species of _Brassica_\r\nwas diffused throughout the south-west of Asia at an epoch later than\r\nthat of the ancient Hebrews.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Skirret+—_Sium Sisarum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis vivacious Umbellifer, furnished with several diverging roots in the\r\nform of a carrot, is believed to come from Eastern Asia. Linnæus\r\nindicates China, doubtfully; and Loureiro,[72] China and Cochin-China,\r\nwhere he says it is cultivated. Others have mentioned Japan and the\r\nCorea, but in these countries there are species which it is easy to\r\nconfound with the one in question, particularly _Sium Ninsi_ and _Panax\r\nGinseng_. Maximowicz,[73] who has seen these plants in China and in\r\nJapan, and who has studied the herbariums of St. Petersburgh, recognizes\r\nonly the Altaic region of Siberia and the North of Persia as the home of\r\nthe wild _Sium Sisarum_. I am very doubtful whether it is to be found in\r\nthe Himalayas or in China, since modern works on the region of the river\r\nAmoor and on British India make no mention of it.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the ancient Greeks and Romans knew this plant.\r\nThe names _Sisaron_ of Dioscorides, _Siser_ of Columella and of\r\nPliny,[74] are attributed to it. Certainly the modern Italian name\r\n_sisaro_ or _sisero_ seems to confirm this idea; but how could these\r\nauthors have failed to notice that several roots descend from the base\r\nof the stem, whereas all the other umbels cultivated in Europe have but\r\na single tap-root? It is just possible that the _siser_ of Columella, a\r\ncultivated plant, may have been the parsnip; but what Pliny says of the\r\n_siser_ does not apply to it. According to him it was a medicinal plant,\r\n_inter medica dicendum_.[75] He says that Tiberius caused a quantity to\r\nbe brought every year from Germany, which proves, he adds, that it\r\nthrives in cold countries.\r\n\r\nIf the Greeks had received the plant direct from Persia, Theophrastus\r\nwould probably have known it. It came perhaps from Siberia into Russia,\r\nand thence into Germany, in which case the anecdote about Tiberius might\r\nwell apply to the skirret. I cannot find any Russian name, certainly,\r\nbut the Germans have original names, _Krizel_ or _Grizel_, _Görlein_ or\r\n_Gierlein_, which indicate an ancient cultivation, more than the\r\nordinary name _Zuckerwurzel_, or sugar-root.[76] The Danish name has the\r\nsame meaning—_sokerot_, whence the English _skirret_. The name _sisaron_\r\nis not known in modern Greece; nor was it known there even in the Middle\r\nAges, and the plant is not now cultivated in that country.[77] There are\r\nreasons for doubt as to the true sense of the words _sisaron_ and\r\n_siser_. Some botanists of the sixteenth century thought that _sisaron_\r\nwas perhaps the _parsnip_ proper, and Sprengel[78] supports this idea.\r\n\r\nThe French names _chervis_ and _girole_[79] would perhaps teach us\r\nsomething if we knew their origin. Littré derives _chervis_ from the\r\nSpanish _chirivia_, but the latter is more likely derived from the\r\nFrench. Bauhin[80] mentions the low Latin names _servillum_,\r\n_chervillum_, or _servillam_, words which are not in Ducange’s\r\ndictionary. This may well be the origin of _chervis_, but whence came\r\n_servillum_ or _chervillum_?\r\n\r\n\r\n+Arracacha+ or +Arracacia+—_Arracacha esculenta_, de Candolle.\r\n\r\nAn umbel generally cultivated in Venezuela, New Granada, and Ecuador as\r\na nutritious plant. In the temperate regions of those countries it bears\r\ncomparison with the potato, and even yields, we are assured, a lighter\r\nand more agreeable _fecula_. The lower part of the stem is swelled into\r\na bulb, on which, when the plant thrives well, tubercles, or lateral\r\nbulbs, form themselves, and persist for several months, which are more\r\nprized than the central bulb, and serve for future planting.[81]\r\n\r\nThe species is probably indigenous in the region where it is cultivated,\r\nbut I do not find in any author a positive assertion of the fact. The\r\nexisting descriptions are drawn from cultivated stocks. Grisebach indeed\r\nsays that he has seen (presumably in the herbarium at Kew) specimens\r\ngathered in New Granada, in Peru, and in Trinidad,[82] but he does not\r\nsay whether they were wild. The other species of the same genus, to the\r\nnumber of a dozen, grow in the same districts of America, which renders\r\nthe above-mentioned origin more probable.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the arracacha into Europe has been attempted several\r\ntimes without success. The damp climate of England accounts for the\r\nfailure of Sir William Hooker’s attempts; but ours, made at two\r\ndifferent times, under very different conditions, have met with no\r\nbetter success. The lateral bulbs did not form, and the central bulb\r\ndied in the house where it was placed for the winter. The bulbs\r\npresented to different botanical gardens in France and Italy and\r\nelsewhere shared the same fate. It is clear that if the plant is in\r\nAmerica really equal to the potato in productiveness and taste, this\r\nwill never be the case in Europe. Its cultivation does not in America\r\nspread as far as Chili and Mexico, like that of the potato and sweet\r\npotato, which confirms the difficulty of propagation observed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Madder+—_Rubia tinctorum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe madder is certainly wild in Italy, Greece, the Crimea, Asia Minor,\r\nSyria, Persia, Armenia, and near Lenkoran.[83] As we advance westward in\r\nthe south of Europe, the wild, indigenous nature of the plant becomes\r\nmore and more doubtful. There is uncertainty even in France. In the\r\nnorth and east the plant appears to be “naturalized in hedges and on\r\nwalls,”[84] or “subspontaneous,” escaped from former cultivation.[85] In\r\nProvence and Languedoc it is more spontaneous or wild, but here also it\r\nmay have spread from a somewhat extensive cultivation. In the Iberian\r\npeninsula it is mentioned as “subspontaneous.”[86] It is the same in the\r\nnorth of Africa.[87] Evidently the natural, ancient, and undoubted\r\nhabitation is western temperate Asia and the south-east of Europe. It\r\ndoes not appear that the plant has been found beyond the Caspian Sea in\r\nthe land formerly occupied by the Indo-Europeans, but this region is\r\nstill little known. The species only exists in India as a cultivated\r\nplant, and has no Sanskrit name.[88]\r\n\r\nNeither is there any known Hebrew name, while the Greeks, Romans, Slavs,\r\nGermans, and Kelts had various names, which a philologist could perhaps\r\ntrace to one or two roots, but which nevertheless indicate by their\r\nnumerous modifications an ancient date. Probably the wild roots were\r\ngathered in the fields before the idea of cultivating the species was\r\nsuggested. Pliny, however, says[89] that it was cultivated in Italy in\r\nhis time, and it is possible that the custom was of older date in Greece\r\nand Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of madder is often mentioned in French records of the\r\nMiddle Ages.[90] It was afterwards neglected or abandoned, until Althen\r\nreintroduced it into the neighbourhood of Avignon in the middle of the\r\neighteenth century. It flourished formerly in Alsace, Germany, Holland,\r\nand especially in Greece, Asia Minor, and Syria, whence the exportation\r\nwas considerable; but the discovery of dyes extracted from inorganic\r\nsubstances has suppressed this cultivation, to the great detriment of\r\nthe provinces which drew large profits from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Jerusalem Artichoke+—_Helianthus tuberosus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1616 that European botanists first mentioned this\r\nComposite, with a large root better adapted for the food of animals than\r\nof man. Columna[91] had seen it in the garden of Cardinal Farnese, and\r\ncalled it _Aster peruanus tuberosus_. Other authors of the same century\r\ngave it epithets showing that it was believed to come from Brazil, or\r\nfrom Canada, or from the Indies, that is to say, America. Linnæus[92]\r\nadopted, on Parkinson’s authority, the opinion of a Canadian origin, of\r\nwhich, however, he had no proof. I pointed out formerly[93] that there\r\nare no species of the genus Helianthus in Brazil, and that they are, on\r\nthe contrary, numerous in North America.\r\n\r\nSchlechtendal,[94] after having proved that the Jerusalem artichoke can\r\nresist the severe winters of the centre of Europe, observes that this\r\nfact is in favour of the idea of a Canadian origin, and contrary to the\r\nbelief of its coming from some southern region. Decaisne[95] has\r\neliminated from the synonymy of _H. tuberosus_ several quotations which\r\nhad occasioned the belief in a South American or Mexican origin. Like\r\nthe American botanists, he recalls what ancient travellers had narrated\r\nof certain customs of the aborigines of the Northern States and of\r\nCanada. Thus Champlain, in 1603, had seen, “in their hands, roots which\r\nthey cultivate, and which taste like an artichoke.” Lescarbot[96] speaks\r\nof these roots with the artichoke flavour, which multiply freely, and\r\nwhich he had brought back to France, where they began to be sold under\r\nthe name of _topinambaux_. The savages, he says, call them _chiquebi_.\r\nDecaisne also quotes two French horticulturists of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, Colin and Sagard, who evidently speak of the Jerusalem\r\nartichoke, and say it came from Canada. It is to be noted that the name\r\nCanada had at that time a vague meaning, and comprehended some parts of\r\nthe modern United States. Gookin, an American writer on the customs of\r\nthe aborigines, says that they put pieces of the Jerusalem artichoke\r\ninto their soups.[97]\r\n\r\nBotanical analogies and the testimony of contemporaries agree, as we\r\nhave seen, in considering this plant to be a native of the north-east of\r\nAmerica. Dr. Asa Gray, seeing that it is not found wild, had formerly\r\nsupposed it to be a variety of _H. doronicoides_ of Lamarck, but he has\r\nsince abandoned this idea (_American Journal of Science_, 1883, p. 224).\r\nAn author gives it as wild in the State of Indiana.[98] The French name\r\n_topinambour_ comes apparently from some real or supposed Indian name.\r\nThe English name Jerusalem artichoke is a corruption of the Italian\r\n_girasole_, sunflower, combined with an allusion to the artichoke\r\nflavour of the root.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Salsify+—_Tragopogon porrifolium_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe salsify was more cultivated a century or two ago than it is now. It\r\nis a biennial composite, found wild in Greece, Dalmatia, Italy, and even\r\nin Algeria.[99] It frequently escapes from gardens in the west of\r\nEurope, and becomes half-naturalized.[100]\r\n\r\nCommentators[101] give the name _Tragopogon_ (goat’s beard) of\r\nTheophrastus sometimes to the modern species, sometimes to _Tragopogon\r\ncrocifolium_, which also grows in Greece. It is difficult to know if the\r\nancients cultivated the salsify or gathered it wild in the country. In\r\nthe sixteenth century Olivier de Serres says it was a new culture in his\r\ncountry, the south of France. Our word _Salsifis_ comes from the Italian\r\n_Sassefrica_, that which rubs stones, a senseless term.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Scorzonera+—_Scorzonera hispanica_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis plant is sometimes called the Spanish salsify, from its resemblance\r\nto _Tragopogon porrifolium_; but its root has a brown skin, whence its\r\nbotanical name, and the popular name _écorce noire_ in some French\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nIt is wild in Europe, from Spain, where it abounds, the south of France,\r\nand Germany, to the region of Caucasus, and perhaps even as far as\r\nSiberia, but it is wanting in Sicily and Greece.[102] In several parts\r\nof Germany the species is probably naturalized from cultivation.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this plant has only been cultivated within the last\r\nhundred or hundred and fifty years. The botanists of the sixteenth\r\ncentury speak of it as a wild species introduced occasionally into\r\nbotanical gardens. Olivier de Serres does not mention it.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly supposed to be an antidote against the bite of adders,\r\nand was sometimes called the viper’s plant. As to the etymology of the\r\nname _Scorzonera_, it is so evident, that it is difficult to understand\r\nhow early writers, even Tournefort,[103] have declared the origin of\r\nthe word to be _escorso_, viper in Spanish or Catalan. Viper is in\r\nSpanish more commonly _vibora_.\r\n\r\nThere exists in Sicily a _Scorzonera deliciosa_, Gussone, whose very\r\nsugary root is used in the confection of bonbons and sherbets, at\r\nPalermo.[104] How is it that its cultivation has not been tried? It is\r\ntrue that I tasted at Naples _Scorzonera_ ices, and found them\r\ndetestable, but they were perhaps made of the common species\r\n(_Scorzonera hispanica_).\r\n\r\n\r\n+Potato+—_Solanum tuberosum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 I stated and discussed what was then known about the origin of\r\nthe potato, and about its introduction into Europe.[105] I will now add\r\nthe result of the researches of the last quarter of a century. It will\r\nbe seen that the data formerly acquired have become more certain, and\r\nthat several somewhat doubtful accessory questions have remained\r\nuncertain, though the probabilities in favour of what formerly seemed\r\nthe truth have grown stronger.\r\n\r\nIt is proved beyond a doubt that at the time of the discovery of America\r\nthe cultivation of the potato was practised, with every appearance of\r\nancient usage, in the temperate regions extending from Chili to New\r\nGranada, at altitudes varying with the latitude. This appears from the\r\ntestimony of all the early travellers, among whom I shall name Acosta\r\nfor Peru,[106] and Pedro Cieca, quoted by de l’Ecluse,[107] for Quito.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern temperate region of South America, on the heights of\r\nGuiana and Brazil, for instance, the potato was not known to the\r\naborigines, or if they were acquainted with a similar plant, it was\r\n_Solanum Commersonii_, which has also a tuberous root, and is found wild\r\nin Montevideo and in the south of Brazil. The true potato is certainly\r\nnow cultivated in the latter country, but it is of such recent\r\nintroduction that it has received the name of the English Batata.[108]\r\nAccording to Humboldt it was unknown in Mexico,[109] a fact confirmed\r\nby the silence of subsequent authors, but to a certain degree\r\ncontradicted by another historical fact. It is said that Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh, or rather Thomas Herriott, his companion in several voyages,\r\nbrought back to Ireland, in 1585 or 1586, some tubers of the Virginian\r\npotato.[110] Its name in its own country was _openawk_. From Herriott’s\r\ndescription of the plant, quoted by Sir Joseph Banks,[111] there is no\r\ndoubt that it was the potato, and not the batata, which at that period\r\nwas sometimes confounded with it. Besides, Gerard[112] tells us that he\r\nreceived from Virginia the potato which he cultivated in his garden, and\r\nof which he gives an illustration which agrees in all points with\r\n_Solanum tuberosum_. He was so proud of it that he is represented, in\r\nhis portrait at the beginning of the work, holding in his hand a\r\nflowering branch of this plant.\r\n\r\nThe species could scarcely have been introduced into Virginia or\r\nCarolina in Raleigh’s time (1585), unless the ancient Mexicans had\r\npossessed it, and its cultivation had been diffused among the aborigines\r\nto the north of Mexico. Dr. Roulin, who has carefully studied the works\r\non North America, has assured me that he has found no signs of the\r\npotato in the United States before the arrival of the Europeans. Dr. Asa\r\nGray also told me so, adding that Mr. Harris, one of the men most\r\nintimately acquainted with the language and customs of North American\r\ntribes, was of the same opinion. I have read nothing to the contrary in\r\nrecent publications, and we must not forget that a plant so easy of\r\ncultivation would have spread itself even among nomadic tribes, had they\r\npossessed it. It seems to me most likely that some inhabitants of\r\nVirginia—perhaps English colonists—received tubers from Spanish or\r\nother travellers, traders or adventurers, during the ninety years which\r\nhad elapsed since the discovery of America. Evidently, dating from the\r\nconquest of Peru and Chili, in 1535 to 1585, many vessels could have\r\ncarried tubers of the potato as provisions, and Sir Walter Raleigh,\r\nmaking war on the Spaniards as a privateer, may have pillaged some\r\nvessel which contained them. This is the less improbable, since the\r\nSpaniards had introduced the plant into Europe before 1585.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Banks[113] and Dunal[114] were right to insist upon the fact\r\nthat the potato was first introduced by the Spaniard, since for a long\r\ntime the credit was generally given to Sir Walter Raleigh, who was the\r\nsecond introducer, and even to other Englishmen, who had introduced, not\r\nthe potato but the _batata_ (sweet potato), which is more or less\r\nconfounded with it.[115] A celebrated botanist, de l’Ecluse,[116] had\r\nnevertheless defined the facts in a remarkable manner. It is he who\r\npublished the first good description and illustration of the potato,\r\nunder the significant name of _Papas Peruanorum_. From what he says, the\r\nspecies has little changed under the culture of nearly three centuries,\r\nfor it yielded in the beginning as many as fifty tubers of unequal size,\r\nfrom one to two inches long, irregularly ovoid, reddish, ripening in\r\nNovember (at Vienna). The flower was more or less pink externally, and\r\nreddish within, with five longitudinal stripes of green, as is often\r\nseen now. No doubt numerous varieties have been obtained, but the\r\noriginal form has not been lost. De l’Ecluse compares the scent of the\r\nflower with that of the lime, the only difference from our modern plant.\r\nHe sowed seeds which produced a white-flowered variety, such as we\r\nsometimes see now.\r\n\r\nThe plants described by de l’Ecluse were sent to him in 1588, by\r\nPhilippe de Sivry, Seigneur of Waldheim and Governor of Mons, who had\r\nreceived them from some one in attendance on the papal legate in\r\nBelgium. De l’Ecluse adds that the species had been introduced into\r\nItaly from Spain or America (_certum est vel ex Hispania, vel ex America\r\nhabuisse_), and he wonders that, although the plant had become so common\r\nin Italy that it was eaten like a turnip and given to the pigs, the\r\nlearned men of the University of Padua only became acquainted with it by\r\nmeans of the tuber which he sent them from Germany. Targioni[117] has\r\nnot been able to discover any proof that the potato was as widely\r\ncultivated in Italy at the end of the sixteenth century as de l’Ecluse\r\nasserts, but he quotes Father Magazzini of Vallombrosa, whose posthumous\r\nwork, published in 1623, mentions the species as one previously brought,\r\nwithout naming the date, from Spain or Portugal by barefooted friars. It\r\nwas, therefore, towards the end of the sixteenth or at the beginning of\r\nthe seventeenth century that the cultivation of the potato became known\r\nin Tuscany. Independently of what de l’Ecluse and the agriculturist of\r\nVallombrosa say of its introduction from the Iberian peninsula, it is\r\nnot at all likely that the Italians had any dealings with Raleigh’s\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nNo one can doubt that the potato is of American origin; but in order to\r\nknow from what part of that vast continent it was brought, it is\r\nnecessary to know if the plant is found wild there, and in what\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nTo answer this question clearly, we must first remove two causes of\r\nerror: the confusion of allied species of the genus _Solanum_ with the\r\npotato; and the other, the mistakes made by travellers as to the wild\r\ncharacter of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe allied species are _Solanum Commersonii_ of Dunal, of which I have\r\nalready spoken; _S. maglia_ of Molina, a Chili species; _S. immite_ of\r\nDunal, a native of Peru; and _S. verrucosum_[118] of Schlechtendal,\r\nwhich grows in Mexico. These three kinds of _Solanum_ have smaller\r\ntubers than _S. tuberosum_, and differ also in other characteristics\r\nindicated in special works on botany. Theoretically, it may be believed\r\nthat all these, and other forms growing in America, are derived from a\r\nsingle earlier species, but in our geological epoch they present\r\nthemselves with differences which seem to me to justify specific\r\ndistinctions, and no experiments have proved that by crossing one with\r\nanother a product would be obtained of which the seed (not the tubers)\r\nwould propagate the race. Leaving these more or less doubtful questions\r\nof species, let us try to ascertain whether the common form of _Solanum\r\ntuberosum_ has been found wild, and merely remark that the abundance of\r\ntuberous solanums growing in the temperate regions of America, from\r\nChili or Buenos Ayres as far as Mexico, confirms the fact of an American\r\norigin. If we knew nothing more, this would be a strong presumption in\r\nfavour of this country being the original home of the potato.\r\n\r\nThe second cause of error is very clearly explained by the botanist\r\nWeddell,[119] who has carefully explored Bolivia and the neighbouring\r\ncountries. “When we reflect,” he says, “that on the arid Cordillera the\r\nIndians often establish their little plots of cultivation on points\r\nwhich would appear almost inaccessible to the great majority of our\r\nEuropean farmers, we understand that when a traveller chances to visit\r\none of these cultivated plots, long since abandoned, and finds there a\r\nplant of _Solanum tuberosum_ which has accidentally persisted, he\r\ngathers it in the belief that it is really wild; but of this there is no\r\nproof.”\r\n\r\nWe come now to facts. These abound concerning the wild character of the\r\nplant in Chili.\r\n\r\nIn 1822, Alexander Caldcleugh,[120] English consul, sent to the London\r\nHorticultural Society some tubers of the potato which he had found in\r\nthe ravines round Valparaiso. He says that these tubers are small,\r\nsometimes red, sometimes yellowish, and rather bitter in taste.[121] “I\r\nbelieve,” he adds, “that this plant exists over a great extent of the\r\nlittoral, for it is found in the south of Chili, where the aborigines\r\ncall it _maglia_.” This is probably a confusion with _S. maglia_ of\r\nbotanists; but the tubers of Valparaiso, planted in London, produced the\r\ntrue potato, as we see from a glance at Sabine’s coloured figure in the\r\n_Transactions of the Horticultural Society_. The cultivation of this\r\nplant was continued for some time, and Lindley certified anew, in 1847,\r\nits identity with the common potato.[122] Here is the account of the\r\nValparaiso plant, given by a traveller to Sir William Hooker.[123] “I\r\nnoticed the potato on the shore as far as fifteen leagues to the north\r\nof this town, and to the south, but I do not know how far it extends. It\r\ngrows on cliffs and hills near the sea, and I do not remember to have\r\nseen it more than two or three leagues from the coast. Although it is\r\nfound in mountainous places, far from cultivation, it does not exist in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood of the fields and gardens where it is\r\nplanted, excepting when a stream crosses these enclosures and carries\r\nthe tubers into uncultivated places.” The potato described by these two\r\ntravellers had white flowers, as is seen in some cultivated European\r\nvarieties, and like the plant formerly reared by de l’Ecluse. We may\r\nassume that this is the natural colour of the species, or at least one\r\nof the most common in its wild state.\r\n\r\nDarwin, in his voyage in the _Beagle_, found the potato growing wild in\r\ngreat abundance on the sand of the sea-shore, in the archipelago of\r\nSouthern Chili, and growing with a remarkable vigour, which may be\r\nattributed to the damp climate. The tallest plants attained to the\r\nheight of four feet. The tubers were small as a rule, though one of them\r\nwas two inches in diameter. They were watery, insipid, but with no bad\r\ntaste when cooked. “The plant is undoubtedly wild,” says the\r\nauthor,[124] “and its specific identity has been confirmed first by\r\nHenslow, and afterwards by Sir Joseph Hooker in his _Flora\r\nAntarctica_.[125]”\r\n\r\nA specimen in the herbarium collected by Claude Gay, considered by Dunal\r\nto be _Solanum tuberosum_, bears this inscription: “From the centre of\r\nthe Cordilleras of Talcagouay, and of Cauquenes, in places visited only\r\nby botanists and geologists.” The same author, Gay, in his _Flora\r\nChilena_,[126] insists upon the abundance of the wild potato in Chili,\r\neven among the Araucanians in the mountains of Malvarco, where, he says,\r\nthe soldiers of Pincheira used to go and seek it for food. This evidence\r\nsufficiently proves its wild state in Chili, so that I may omit other\r\nless convincing testimony—for instance, that of Molina and Meyen, whose\r\nspecimens from Chili have not been examined.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the coast of Chili is continued upon the heights as we\r\nfollow the chain of the Andes, and the cultivation of the potato is of\r\nancient date in the temperate regions of Peru, but the wild character of\r\nthe species there is not so entirely proved as in the case of\r\nChili.[127] Pavon declared he found it on the coast at Chancay, and near\r\nLima. The heat of these districts seems very great for a species which\r\nrequires a temperate or even a rather cold climate. Moreover, the\r\nspecimen in Boissier’s herbarium, gathered by Pavon, belongs, according\r\nto Dunal,[128] to another species, to which he has given the name of _S.\r\nimmite_. I have seen the authentic specimen, and have no doubt that it\r\nbelongs to a species distinct from the _S. tuberosum_. Sir W.\r\nHooker[129] speaks of McLean’s specimen, gathered in the hills round\r\nLima, without any information as to whether it was found wild. The\r\nspecimens (more or less wild) which Matthews sent from Peru to Sir W.\r\nHooker belong, according to Sir Joseph,[130] to varieties which differ a\r\nlittle from the true potato. Mr. Hemsley,[131] who has seen them\r\nrecently in the herbarium at Kew, believes them to be “distinct forms,\r\nnot more distinct, however, than certain varieties of the species.”\r\n\r\nWeddell,[132] whose caution in this matter we already know, expresses\r\nhimself as follows:—“I have never found _Solanum tuberosum_ in Peru\r\nunder such circumstances as left no doubt that it was indigenous; and I\r\neven declare that I do not attach more belief to the wild nature of\r\nother plants found scattered on the Andes outside Chili, hitherto\r\nconsidered as indigenous.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand. M. Ed. André[133] collected with great care, in two\r\nelevated and wild districts of Columbia, and in another near Lima,\r\nspecimens which he believed he might attribute to _S. tuberosum_. M.\r\nAndré has been kind enough to lend them to me. I have compared them\r\nattentively with the types of Dunal’s species in my herbarium and in\r\nthat of M. Boissier. None of these Solanaceæ belong, in my opinion, to\r\n_S. tuberosum_, although that of La Union, near the river Cauca, comes\r\nnearer than the rest. None—and this is yet more certain—answers to _S.\r\nimmite_ of Dunal. They are nearer to _S. columbianum_ of the same author\r\nthan to _S. tuberosum_ or _S. immite_. The specimen from Mount Quindio\r\npresents a singular characteristic—it has pointed ovoid berries.[134]\r\n\r\nIn Mexico the tuberous Solanums attributed to _S. tuberosum_, or,\r\naccording to Hemsley,[135] to allied forms, do not appear to be\r\nidentical with the cultivated plant. They belong to _S. Fendleri_, which\r\nDr. Asa Gray considered at first as a separate species, and\r\nafterwards[136] as a variety of _S. tuberosum_ or of _S. verrucosum_.\r\n\r\nWe may sum up as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. The potato is wild in Chili, in a form which is still seen in our\r\ncultivated plants.\r\n\r\n2. It is very doubtful whether its natural home extends to Peru and New\r\nGranada.\r\n\r\n3. Its cultivation was diffused before the discovery of America from\r\nChili to New Granada.\r\n\r\n4. It was introduced, probably in the latter half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, into that part of the United States now known as Virginia and\r\nNorth Carolina.\r\n\r\n5. It was imported into Europe between 1580 and 1585, first by the\r\nSpaniards, and afterwards by the English, at the time of Raleigh’s\r\nvoyages to Virginia.[137]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Batata+, or +Sweet Potato+—_Convolvulus batatas_, Linnæus; _Batatas\r\nedulis_, Choisy.\r\n\r\nThe roots of this plant, swelled into tubers, resemble potatoes, whence\r\nit arose that sixteenth-century navigators applied the same name to\r\nthese two very different species. The sweet potato belongs to the\r\nConvolvulus family, the potato to the Solanum family; the fleshy parts\r\nof the former are roots, those of the latter subterranean branches.[138]\r\nThe sweet potato is sugary as well as farinaceous. It is cultivated in\r\nall countries within or near the tropics, and perhaps more in the new\r\nthan in the old world.[139]\r\n\r\nIts origin is, according to a great number of authors, doubtful.\r\nHumboldt,[140] Meyen,[141] and Boissier[142] hold to its American,\r\nBoyer,[143] Choisy,[144] etc., to its Asiatic origin. The same diversity\r\nis observed in earlier works. The question is the more difficult since\r\nthe Convolvulaceæ is one of the most widely diffused families, either\r\nfrom a very early epoch or in consequence of modern transportation.\r\n\r\nThere are powerful arguments in favour of an American origin. The\r\nfifteen known species of the genus _Batatas_ are all found in America;\r\neleven in that continent alone, four both in America and the old world,\r\nwith possibility or probability of transportation. The cultivation of\r\nthe common sweet potato is widely diffused in America. It dates from a\r\nvery early epoch. Marcgraff[145] mentions it in Brazil under the name of\r\n_jetica_. Humboldt says that the name _camote_ comes from a Mexican\r\nword. The word _Batatas_ (whence comes by a mistaken transfer the word\r\npotato) is given as American. Sloane and Hughes[146] speak of the sweet\r\npotato as of a plant much cultivated, and having several varieties in\r\nthe West Indies. They do not appear to suspect that it had a foreign\r\norigin. Clusius, who was one of the first to mention the sweet potato,\r\nsays he had eaten some in the south of Spain, where it was supposed to\r\nhave come from the new world.[147] He quotes the names _Batatas_,\r\n_camotes_, _amotes_, _ajes_,[148] which were foreign to the languages of\r\nthe old world. The date of his book is 1601. Humboldt[149] says that,\r\naccording to Gomara, Christopher Columbus, when he appeared for the\r\nfirst time before Queen Isabella, offered her various productions from\r\nthe new world, sweet potatoes among others. Thus, he adds, the\r\ncultivation of this plant was already common in Spain from the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century. Oviedo,[150] writing in 1526, had seen the\r\nsweet potato freely cultivated by the natives of St. Domingo, and had\r\nintroduced it himself at Avila, in Spain. Rumphius[151] says positively\r\nthat, according to the general opinion, sweet potatoes were brought by\r\nthe Spanish Americans to Manilla and the Moluccas, whence the Portuguese\r\ndiffused it throughout the Malay Archipelago. He quotes the popular\r\nnames, which are not Malay, and which indicate an introduction by the\r\nCastillians. Lastly, it is certain that the sweet potato was unknown to\r\nthe Greeks, Romans, and Arabs; that it was not cultivated in Egypt even\r\neighty years ago,[152] a fact which it would be hard to explain if we\r\nsupposed its origin to be in the old world.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are arguments in favour of an Asiatic origin.\r\nThe Chinese _Encyclopædia of Agriculture_ speaks of the sweet potato,\r\nand mentions different varieties;[153] but Bretschneider[154] has proved\r\nthat the species is described for the first time in a book of the second\r\nor third century of our era. According to Thunberg,[155] the sweet\r\npotato was brought to Japan by the Portuguese. Lastly, the plant\r\ncultivated at Tahiti, in the neighbouring islands, and in New Zealand,\r\nunder the names _umara_, _gumarra_, and _gumalla_, described by\r\nForster[156] under the name of _Convolvulus chrysorhizus_, is, according\r\nto Sir Joseph Hooker, the sweet potato.[157] Seemann[158] remarks that\r\nthese names resemble the Quichuen name of the sweet potato in America,\r\nwhich is, he says, _cumar_. The cultivation of the sweet potato became\r\ngeneral in Hindustan in the eighteenth century.[159] Several popular\r\nnames are attributed to it, and even, according to Piddington,[160] a\r\nSanskrit name, _ruktalu_, which has no analogy with any name known to\r\nme, and is not in Wilson’s Sanskrit Dictionary. According to a note\r\ngiven me by Adolphe Pictet, _ruktalu_ seems a Bengalee name composed\r\nfrom the Sanskrit _alu_ (_Rukta_ plus _âlu_, the name of _Arum\r\ncampanulatum_). This name in modern dialects designates the yam and the\r\npotato. However, Wallich[161] gives several names omitted by Piddington.\r\nRoxburgh[162] mentions no Sanskrit name. Rheede[163] says the plant was\r\ncultivated in Malabar, and mentions common Indian names.\r\n\r\nThe arguments in favour of an American origin seem to me much stronger.\r\nIf the sweet potato had been known in Hindustan at the epoch of the\r\nSanskrit language it would have become diffused in the old world, since\r\nits propagation is easy and its utility evident. It seems, on the\r\ncontrary, that this cultivation remained long unknown in the Sunda\r\nIsles, Egypt, etc. Perhaps an attentive examination might lead us to\r\nshare the opinion of Meyer,[164] who distinguished the Asiatic plant\r\nfrom the American species. However, this author has not been generally\r\nfollowed, and I suspect that if there is a different Asiatic species it\r\nis not, as Meyer believed, the sweet potato described by Rumphius, which\r\nthe latter says was brought from America, but the Indian plant of\r\nRoxburgh.\r\n\r\nSweet potatoes are grown in Africa; but either the cultivation is rare,\r\nor the species are different. Robert Brown[165] says that the traveller\r\nLockhardt had not seen the sweet potato of whose cultivation the\r\nPortuguese missionaries make mention. Thonning[166] does not name it.\r\nVogel brought back a species cultivated on the western coast, which is\r\ncertainly, according to the authors of the _Flora Nigritiana_, _Batatas\r\npaniculata_ of Choisy. It was, therefore, a plant cultivated for\r\nornament or for medicinal purposes, for its root is purgative.[167] It\r\nmight be supposed that in certain countries in the old or new world\r\n_Ipomœa tuberosa_. L., had been confounded with the sweet potato; but\r\nSloane[168] tells us that its enormous roots are not eatable.[169]\r\n\r\n_Ipomœa mammosa_, Choisy (_Convolvulus mammosus_, Loureiro; _Batata\r\nmammosa_, Rumphius), is a Convolvulaceous plant with an edible root,\r\nwhich may well be confounded with the sweet potato, but whose botanical\r\ncharacter is nevertheless distinct. This species grows wild near Amboyna\r\n(Rumphius), where it is also cultivated. It is prized in Cochin-China.\r\n\r\nAs for the sweet potato (_Batatas edulis_), no botanist, as far as I\r\nknow, has asserted that he found it wild himself, either in India or\r\nAmerica.[170] Clusius[171] affirms upon hearsay that it grows wild in\r\nthe new world and in the neighbouring islands.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the probability of an American origin, there remains, as we\r\nhave seen, much that is unknown or uncertain touching the original home\r\nand the transport of this species, which is a valuable one in hot\r\ncountries. Whether it was a native of the new or of the old world, it is\r\ndifficult to explain its transportation from America to China at the\r\nbeginning of our era, and to the South Sea Islands at an early epoch, or\r\nfrom Asia and from Australia to America at a time sufficiently remote\r\nfor its cultivation to have been early diffused from the Southern States\r\nto Brazil and Chili. We must assume a prehistoric communication between\r\nAsia and America, or adopt another hypothesis, which is not inapplicable\r\nto the present case. The order _Convolvulaceæ_ is one of those rare\r\nfamilies of dicotyledons in which certain species have a widely extended\r\narea, extending even to distant continents.[172] A species which can at\r\nthe present day endure the different climates of Virginia and Japan may\r\nwell have existed further north before the epoch of the great extension\r\nof glaciers in our hemisphere, and prehistoric men may have transported\r\nit southward when the climatic conditions altered. According to this\r\nhypothesis, cultivation alone preserved the species, unless it is at\r\nlast discovered in some spot in its ancient habitation—in Mexico or\r\nColumbia, for instance.[173]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Beetroot+—_Beta vulgaris_ and _B. maritima_, Linnæus; _Beta vulgaris_,\r\nMoquin.\r\n\r\nThis plant is cultivated sometimes for its fleshy root (red beet),\r\nsometimes for its leaves, which are used as a vegetable (white beet),\r\nbut botanists are generally agreed in not dividing the species. It is\r\nknown from other examples that plants slender rooted by nature easily\r\nbecome fleshy rooted from the effects of soil or cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe slender-rooted variety grows wild in sandy soil, and especially near\r\nthe sea in the Canary Isles, and all along the coasts of the\r\nMediterranean Sea, and as far as the Caspian Sea, Persia, and\r\nBabylon,[174] perhaps even as far as the west of India, whence a\r\nspecimen was brought by Jaquemont, although it is not certain that it\r\nwas growing wild. Roxburgh’s Indian flora, and Aitchison’s more recent\r\nflora of the Punjab and of the Sindh, only mention the plant as a\r\ncultivated species.\r\n\r\nIt has no Sanskrit name,[175] whence it may be inferred that the Aryans\r\nhad not brought it from western temperate Asia, where it exists. The\r\nnations of Aryan race who had previously migrated into Europe probably\r\ndid not cultivate it, for I find no name common to the Indo-European\r\nlanguages. The ancient Greeks, who used the leaves and roots, called the\r\nspecies _teutlion_;[176] the Romans, _beta_. Heldreich[177] gives also\r\nthe ancient Greek name _sevkle_, or _sfekelie_ which resembles the Arab\r\nname _selg_, _silq_,[178] among the Nabatheans. The Arab name has passed\r\ninto the Portuguese _selga_. No Hebrew name is known. Everything shows\r\nthat its cultivation does not date from more than three or four\r\ncenturies before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe red and white roots were known to the ancients, but the number of\r\nvarieties has greatly increased in modern times, especially since the\r\nbeetroot has been cultivated on a large scale for the food of cattle and\r\nfor the production of sugar. It is one of the plants most easily\r\nimproved by selection, as the experiments of Vilmorin have proved.[179]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Manioc+—_Manihot utilissima_, Pohl; _Jatropha manihot_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe manioc is a shrub belonging to the Euphorbia family, of which\r\nseveral roots swell in their first year; they take the form of an\r\nirregular ellipse, and contain a fecula (tapioca) with a more or less\r\npoisonous juice.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly cultivated in the equatorial or tropical regions,\r\nespecially in America from Brazil to the West Indies. In Africa the\r\ncultivation is less general, and seems to be more recent. In certain\r\nAsiatic colonies it is decidedly of modern introduction. It is\r\npropagated by budding.\r\n\r\nBotanists are divided in opinion whether the innumerable varieties of\r\nmanioc should be regarded as forming one, two, or several different\r\nspecies. Pohl[180] admitted several besides his _Manihot utilissima_,\r\nand Dr. Müller,[181] in his monograph on the Euphorbiaceæ, places the\r\nvariety _aipi_ in an allied species, _M. palmata_, a plant cultivated\r\nwith the others in Brazil, and of which the root is not poisonous. This\r\nlast character is not so distinct as might be believed from certain\r\nbooks and even from the assertions of the natives. Dr. Sagot,[182] who\r\nhas compared a dozen varieties of manioc cultivated at Cayenne, says\r\nexpressly, “There are maniocs more poisonous than others, but I doubt\r\nwhether any are entirely free from noxious principles.”\r\n\r\nIt is possible to account for these singular differences of properties\r\nin very similar plants by the example of the potato. The _Manihot_ and\r\n_Solanum tuberosum_ both belong to suspected families (_Euphorbiaceæ_\r\nand _Solanaceæ_). Several of their species are poisonous in some of\r\ntheir organs; but the fecula, wherever it is found, is never harmful,\r\nand the same holds good of the cellular tissue, freed from all deposit;\r\nthat is to say, reduced to cellulose. In the preparation of cassava, or\r\nmanioc flour, great care is taken to scrape the outer skin of the root,\r\nthen to pound or crush the fleshy part so as to express the more or\r\nless poisonous juice, and finally the paste is submitted to a baking\r\nwhich expels the volatile parts.[183] Tapioca is the pure fecula without\r\nthe mixture of the tissues which still exist in the cassava. In the\r\npotato the outer pellicle contracts noxious qualities when it is allowed\r\nto become green by exposure to the light, and it is well known that\r\nunripe or diseased tubers, containing too small a proportion of fecula\r\nwith much sap, are not good to eat, and would cause positive harm to\r\npersons who consumed any quantity of them. All potatoes, and probably\r\nall maniocs, contain something harmful, which is observed even in the\r\nproducts of distillation, and which varies with several causes; but only\r\nmatter foreign to the fecula should be mistrusted.\r\n\r\nThe doubts about the number of species into which the cultivated\r\nmanihots should be divided are no source of difficulty regarding the\r\nquestion of geographic origin. On the contrary, we shall see that they\r\nare an important means of proving an American origin.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Raynal had formerly spread the erroneous opinion that the\r\nmanioc was imported into America from Africa. Robert Brown[184] denied\r\nthis in 1818, but without giving reasons in support of his opinion; and\r\nHumboldt,[185] Moreau de Jonnes,[186] and Saint Hilaire[187] insisted\r\nupon its American origin. It can hardly be doubted for the following\r\nreasons:—\r\n\r\n1. Maniocs were cultivated by the natives of Brazil, Guiana, and the\r\nwarm region of Mexico before the arrival of the Europeans, as all early\r\ntravellers testify. In the West Indies this cultivation was, according\r\nto Acosta,[188] common enough in the sixteenth century to inspire the\r\nbelief that it was also there of a certain antiquity.\r\n\r\n2. It is less widely diffused in Africa, especially in regions at a\r\ndistance from the west coast. It is known that manioc was introduced\r\ninto the Isle of Bourbon by the Governour Labourdonnais.[189] In Asiatic\r\ncountries, where a plant so easy to cultivate would probably have spread\r\nhad it been long known on the African continent, it is mentioned here\r\nand there as an object of curiosity of foreign origin.[190]\r\n\r\n3. The natives of America had several ancient names for the varieties of\r\nmanioc, especially in Brazil,[191] which does not appear to have been\r\nthe case in Africa, even on the coast of Guinea.[192]\r\n\r\n4. The varieties cultivated in Brazil, in Guiana, and in the West Indies\r\nare very numerous, whence we may presume a very ancient cultivation.\r\nThis is not the case in Africa.\r\n\r\n5. The forty-two known species of the genus _Manihot_, without counting\r\n_M. utilissima_, are all wild in America; most of them in Brazil, some\r\nin Guiana, Peru, and Mexico; not one in the old world.[193] It is very\r\nunlikely that a single species, and that the cultivated one, was a\r\nnative both of the old and of the new world, and all the more so since\r\nin the family _Euphorbiaceæ_ the area of the woody species is usually\r\nrestricted, and since phanerogamous plants are very rarely common to\r\nAfrica and America.\r\n\r\nThe American origin of the manioc being thus established, it may be\r\nasked how the species has been introduced into Guinea and Congo. It was\r\nprobably the result of the frequent communications established in the\r\nsixteenth century by Portuguese merchants and slave-traders.\r\n\r\nThe _Manihot utilissima_ and the allied species or variety called\r\n_aipi_, which is also cultivated, have not been found in an undoubtedly\r\nwild state. Humboldt and Bonpland, indeed, found upon the banks of the\r\nMagdalena a plant of _Manihot utilissima_ which they called _almost_\r\nwild,[194] but Dr. Sagot assures me that it has not been found in\r\nGuiana, and that botanists who have explored the hot region in Brazil\r\nhave not been more fortunate. We gather as much from the expressions of\r\nPohl, who has carefully studied these plants, and who was acquainted\r\nwith the collections of Martius, and had no doubt of their American\r\norigin. If he had observed a wild variety identical with those which are\r\ncultivated, he would not have suggested the hypothesis that the manioc\r\nis obtained from his _Manihot pusilla_[195] of the province of Goyaz, a\r\nplant of small size, and considered as a true species or as a variety of\r\n_Manihot palmata_.[196] Martius declared in 1867, that is after having\r\nreceived a quantity of information of a later date than his journey,\r\nthat the plant was not known in a wild state.[197] An early traveller,\r\nusually accurate, Piso,[198] speaks of a wild _mandihoca_, of which the\r\nTapuyeris, the natives of the coast to the north of Rio Janeiro, ate the\r\nroots. “It is,” he says, “very like the cultivated plant;” but the\r\nillustration he gives of it appears unsatisfactory to authors who have\r\nstudied the maniocs. Pohl attributes it to his _M. aipi_, and Dr. Müller\r\npasses it over in silence. For my part, I am disposed to believe what\r\nPiso says, and his figure does not seem to me entirely unsatisfactory.\r\nIt is better than that by Vellozo, of a wild manioc which is doubtfully\r\nattributed to _M. aipi_.[199] If we do not accept the origin in eastern\r\ntropical Brazil, we must have recourse to two hypotheses: either the\r\ncultivated maniocs are obtained from one of the wild species modified by\r\ncultivation, or they are varieties which exist only by the agency of man\r\nafter the disappearance of their fellows from modern wild vegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Garlic+—_Allium sativum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nLinnæus, in his _Species Plantarum_, indicates Sicily as the home of the\r\ncommon garlic; but in his _Hortus Cliffortianus_, where he is usually\r\nmore accurate, he does not give its origin. The fact is that, according\r\nto all the most recent and complete floras of Sicily, Italy, Greece,\r\nFrance, Spain, and Algeria, garlic is not considered to be indigenous,\r\nalthough specimens have been gathered here and there which had more or\r\nless the appearance of being so. A plant so constantly cultivated and so\r\neasily propagated may spread from gardens and persist for a considerable\r\ntime without being wild by nature. I do not know on what authority\r\nKunth[200] mentions that the species is found in Egypt. According to\r\nauthors who are more accurate[201] in their accounts of the plants of\r\nthat country, it is only found there under cultivation. Boissier, whose\r\nherbarium is so rich in Eastern plants, possesses no wild specimens of\r\nit. The only country where garlic has been found in a wild state, with\r\nthe certainty of its really being so, is the desert of the Kirghis of\r\nSungari; bulbs were brought thence and cultivated at Dorpat,[202] and\r\nspecimens were afterwards seen by Regel.[203] The latter author also\r\nsays that he saw a specimen which Wallich had gathered as wild in\r\nBritish India; but Baker,[204] who had access to the rich herbarium at\r\nKew, does not speak of it in his review of the “_Alliums_ of India,\r\nChina, and Japan.”\r\n\r\nLet us see whether historical and philological records confirm the fact\r\nof an origin in the south-west of Siberia alone.\r\n\r\nGarlic has been long cultivated in China under the name of _suan_. It is\r\nwritten in Chinese by a single sign, which usually indicates a long\r\nknown and even a wild species.[205] The floras of Japan[206] do not\r\nmention it, whence I gather that the species was not wild in Eastern\r\nSiberia and Dahuria, but that the Mongols brought it into China.\r\n\r\nAccording to Herodotus, the ancient Egyptians made great use of it.\r\nArchæologists have not found the proof of this in the monuments, but\r\nthis may be because the plant was considered unclean by the\r\npriests.[207]\r\n\r\nThere is a Sanskrit name, _mahoushouda_,[208] become _loshoun_ in\r\nBengali, and to which appears to be related the Hebrew name _schoum_ or\r\n_schumin_,[209] which has produced the Arab _thoum_ or _toum_. The\r\nBasque name _baratchouria_ is thought by de Charencey[210] to be allied\r\nwith Aryan names. In support of his hypothesis I may add that the Berber\r\nname, _tiskert_, is quite different, and that consequently the Iberians\r\nseem to have received the plant and its name rather from the Aryans than\r\nfrom their probable ancestors of Northern Africa. The Lettons call it\r\n_kiplohks_, the Esthonians _krunslauk_, whence probably the German\r\n_Knoblauch_. The ancient Greek name appears to have been _scorodon_, in\r\nmodern Greek _scordon_. The names given by the Slavs of Illyria are\r\n_bili_ and _cesan_. The Bretons say _quinen_,[211] the Welsh _craf_,\r\n_cenhinnen_, or _garlleg_, whence the English _garlic_. The Latin\r\n_allium_ has passed into the languages of Latin origin.[212] This great\r\ndiversity of names intimates a long acquaintance with the plant, and\r\neven an ancient cultivation in Western Asia and in Europe. On the other\r\nhand, if the species has existed only in the land of the Kirghis, where\r\nit is now found, the Aryans might have cultivated it and carried it into\r\nIndia and Europe; but this does not explain the existence of so many\r\nKeltic, Slav, Greek, and Latin names which differ from the Sanskrit. To\r\nexplain this diversity, we must suppose that its original abode extended\r\nfarther to the west than that known at the present day, an extension\r\nanterior to the migrations of the Aryans.\r\n\r\nIf the genus Allium were once made, as a whole, the object of such a\r\nserious study as that of Gay on some of its species,[213] perhaps it\r\nmight be found that certain wild European forms, included by authors\r\nunder _A. arenarium_, L., _A. arenarium_, Sm., or _A. scorodoprasum_,\r\nL., are only varieties of _A. sativum_. In that case everything would\r\nagree to show that the earliest peoples of Europe and Western Asia\r\ncultivated such form of the species just as they found it from Tartary\r\nto Spain, giving it names more or less different.\r\n\r\nONION—_Allium Cepa_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nI will state first what was known in 1855;[214] I will then add the\r\nrecent botanical observations which confirm the inferences from\r\nphilological data.\r\n\r\nThe onion is one of the earliest of cultivated species. Its original\r\ncountry is, according to Kunth, unknown.[215] Let us see if it is\r\npossible to discover it. The modern Greeks call _Allium Cepa_, which\r\nthey cultivate in abundance, _krommunda_.[216] This is a good reason for\r\nbelieving that the _krommuon_ of Theophrastus[217] is the same species,\r\nas sixteenth-century writers already supposed.[218] Pliny[219]\r\ntranslated the word by _cœpa_. The ancient Greeks and Romans knew\r\nseveral varieties, which they distinguished by the names of countries:\r\n_Cyprium_, _Cretense_, _Samothraciae_, etc. One variety cultivated in\r\nEgypt[220] was held to be so excellent that it received divine honours,\r\nto the great amusement of the Romans.[221] Modern Egyptians designate\r\n_A. Cepa_ by the name of _basal_[222] or _bussul_,[223] whence it is\r\nprobable that the _bezalim_ of the Hebrews is the same species, as\r\ncommentators have said.[224] There are several distinct names—_palandu_,\r\n_latarka_, _sakandaka_,[225] and a number of modern Indian names. The\r\nspecies is commonly cultivated in India, Cochin-China, China,[226] and\r\neven in Japan.[227] It was largely consumed by the ancient Egyptians.\r\nThe drawings on their monuments often represent this species.[228] Thus\r\nits cultivation in Southern Asia and the eastern region of the\r\nMediterranean dates from a very early epoch. Moreover, the Chinese,\r\nSanskrit, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin names have no apparent connection.\r\nFrom this last fact we may deduce the hypothesis that its cultivation\r\nwas begun after the separation of the Indo-European nations, the species\r\nbeing found ready to hand in different countries at once. This, however,\r\nis not the present state of things, for we hardly find even vague\r\nindications of the wild state of _A. Cepa_. I have not discovered it in\r\nEuropean or Caucasian floras; but Hasselquist[229] says, “It grows in\r\nthe plains near the sea in the environs of Jericho.” Dr. Wallich\r\nmentioned in his list of Indian plants, No. 5072, specimens which he saw\r\nin districts of Bengal, without mentioning whether they were cultivated.\r\nThis indication, however insufficient, together with the antiquity of\r\nthe Sanskrit and Hebrew names, and the communication which is known to\r\nhave existed between the peoples of India and of Egypt, lead me to\r\nsuppose that this plant occupied a vast area in Western Asia, extending\r\nperhaps from Palestine to India. Allied species, sometimes mistaken for\r\n_A. Cepa_, exist in Siberia.[230]\r\n\r\nThe specimens collected by Anglo-Indian botanists, of which Wallich gave\r\nthe first idea, are now better known. Stokes discovered _Allium Cepa_\r\nwild in Beluchistan. He says, “wild on the Chehil Tun.” Griffith brought\r\nit from Afghanistan and Thomson from Lahore, to say nothing of other\r\ncollectors, who are not explicit as to the wild or cultivated nature of\r\ntheir specimens.[231] Boissier possesses a wild specimen found in the\r\nmountainous regions of the Khorassan. The umbels are smaller than in\r\nthe cultivated plant, but there is no other difference. Dr. Regel, jun.,\r\nfound it to the south of Kuldscha, in Western Siberia.[232] Thus my\r\nformer conjectures are completely justified; and it is not unlikely that\r\nits habitation extends even as far as Palestine, as Hasselquist said.\r\n\r\nThe onion is designated in China by a single sign (pronounced _tsung_),\r\nwhich may suggest a long existence there as an indigenous plant.[233] I\r\nvery much doubt, however, that the area extends so far to the east.\r\n\r\nHumboldt[234] says that the Americans have always been acquainted with\r\nonions, in Mexican _xonacatl_. “Cortes,” he says, “speaking of the\r\ncomestibles sold at the market of the ancient Tenochtillan, mentions\r\nonions, leeks, and garlic.” I cannot believe, however, that these names\r\napplied to the species cultivated in Europe. Sloane, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, had only seen one _Allium_ cultivated in Jamaica (_A. Cepa_),\r\nand that was in a garden with other European vegetables.[235] The word\r\n_xonacatl_ is not in Hernandez, and Acosta[236] says distinctly that the\r\nonions and garlics of Peru are of European origin. The species of the\r\ngenus Allium are rare in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Spring+, or +Welsh Onion+—_Allium fistulosum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis species was for a long time mentioned in floras and works on\r\nhorticulture as of unknown origin; but Russian botanists have found it\r\nwild in Siberia towards the Altaï mountains, on the Lake Baikal in the\r\nland of the Kirghis.[237] The ancients did not know the plant.[238] It\r\nmust have come into Europe through Russia in the Middle Ages, or a\r\nlittle later. Dodoens,[239] an author of the sixteenth century, has\r\ngiven a figure of it, hardly recognizable, under the name of _Cepa\r\noblonga_.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Shallot+—_Allium ascalonicum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nIt was believed, according to Pliny,[240] that this plant took its name\r\nfrom Ascalon, in Judæa; but Dr. Fournier[241] thinks that the Latin\r\nauthor mistook the meaning of the word _Askalônion_ of Theophrastus.\r\nHowever this may be, the word has been retained in modern languages\r\nunder the form of _échalote_ in French, _chalote_ in Spanish, _scalogno_\r\nin Italian, _Aschaluch_ or _Eschlauch_ in German.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 I had spoken of the species as follows:[242]—\r\n\r\n“According to Roxburgh,[243] _Allium ascalonicum_ is much cultivated in\r\nIndia. The Sanskrit name _pulandu_ is attributed to it, a word nearly\r\nidentical with _palandu_, attributed to _A. Cepa_.[244] Evidently the\r\ndistinction between the two species is not clear in Indian or\r\nAnglo-Indian works.\r\n\r\n“Loureiro says he saw _Allium ascalonicum_ cultivated in\r\nCochin-China,[245] but he does not mention China, and Thunberg does not\r\nindicate this species in Japan. Its cultivation, therefore, is not\r\nuniversal in the east of Asia. This fact, and the doubt about the\r\nSanskrit name, lead me to think that it is not ancient in Southern Asia.\r\nNeither, in spite of the name of the species, am I convinced that it\r\nexisted in Western Asia. Rauwolf, Forskal, and Delile do not mention it\r\nin Siberia, in Arabia, or in Egypt. Linnæus[246] mentions Hasselquist as\r\nhaving found the species in Palestine. Unfortunately, he gives no\r\ndetails about the locality, nor about its wild condition. In the\r\n_Travels_ of Hasselquist[247] I find a _Cepa montana_ mentioned as\r\ngrowing on Mount Tabor and on a neighbouring mountain, but there is\r\nnothing to prove that it was this species. In his article on the onions\r\nand garlics of the Hebrews he mentions only _Allium Cepa_, then _A.\r\nporrum_ and _A. sativum_. Sibthorp did not find it in Greece,[248] and\r\nFraas[249] does not mention it as now cultivated in that country.\r\nAccording to Koch,[250] it is naturalized among the vines near Fiume.\r\nHowever, Viviani[251] only speaks of it as a cultivated plant in\r\nDalmatia.\r\n\r\n“From all these facts I am led to believe that _Allium ascalonicum_ is\r\nnot a species. It is enough to render its primitive existence doubtful,\r\nto remark: (1) that Theophrastus and ancient writers in general have\r\nspoken of it as a form of the _Allium Cepa_, having the same importance\r\nas the varieties cultivated in Greece, Thrace, and elsewhere; (2) that\r\nits existence in a wild state cannot be proved; (3) that it is little\r\ncultivated, or not all, in the countries where it is supposed to have\r\nhad its origin, as in Syria, Egypt, and Greece; (4) that it is commonly\r\nwithout flowers, whence the name of _Cepa sterilis_ given by Bauhin, and\r\nthe number of its bulbs is an allied fact; (5) when it does flower, the\r\norgans of the flower are similar to those of _A. Cepa_, or at least no\r\ndifference has been hitherto discovered, and according to Koch[252] the\r\nonly difference in the whole plant is that the stalk and leaves are less\r\nswelled, although fistulous.”\r\n\r\nSuch was formerly my opinion.[253] The facts published since 1855 do not\r\ndestroy my doubts, but, on the contrary, justify them. Regel, in 1875,\r\nin his monograph of the genus Allium, declares he has only seen the\r\nshallot as a cultivated species. Aucher Eloy has distributed a plant\r\nfrom Asia Minor under the name of _A. ascalonicum_, but judging from my\r\nspecimen this is certainly not the species. Boissier tells me that he\r\nhas never seen _A. ascalonicum_ in the East, and it is not in his\r\nherbarium. The plant from the Morea which bears this name in the flora\r\nof Bory and Chaubard is quite a different species, which he has named\r\n_A. gomphrenoides_. Baker,[254] in his review of the Alliums of India,\r\nChina, and Japan, mentions _A. ascalonicum_ in districts of Bengal and\r\nof the Punjab, from specimens of Griffith and Aitchison; but he adds,\r\n“They are probably cultivated plants.” He attributes to _A. ascalonicum\r\nAllium sulvia_, Ham., of Nepal, a plant little known, and whose wild\r\ncharacter is uncertain. The shallot produces many bulbs, which may be\r\npropagated or preserved in the neighbourhood of cultivation, and thus\r\ncause mistakes as to its origin.\r\n\r\nFinally, in spite of the progress of botanical investigations in the\r\nEast and in India, this form of Allium has not been found wild with\r\ncertainty. It appears to me, therefore, more probable than ever that it\r\nis a modification of _A. Cepa_, dating from about the beginning of the\r\nChristian era—a modification less considerable than many of those\r\nobserved in other cultivated plants, as, for instance, in the cabbage.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Rocambole+—_Allium scorodoprasum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nIf we cast a glance at the descriptions and names of _A. scorodoprasum_\r\nin works on botany since the time of Linnæus, we shall see that the only\r\npoint on which authors are agreed is the common name of _rocambole_. As\r\nto the distinctive characters, they sometimes approximate the plant to\r\n_Allium sativum_, sometimes regard it as altogether distinct. With such\r\ndifferent definitions, it is difficult to know in what country the\r\nplant, well known in its cultivated state as the _rocambole_, is found\r\nwild. According to Cosson and Germain,[255] it grows in the environs of\r\nParis. According to Grenier and Godron,[256] the same form grows in the\r\neast of France. Burnat says he found the species undoubtedly wild in the\r\nAlpes-Maritimes, and he gave specimens of it to Boissier. Willkomm and\r\nLange do not consider it to be wild in Spain,[257] though one of the\r\nFrench names of the cultivated plant is _ail_ or _eschalote d’Espagne_.\r\nMany other European localities seem to me doubtful, since the specific\r\ncharacters are so uncertain. I mention, however, that, according to\r\nLedebour,[258] the plant which he calls _A. scorodoprasum_ is very\r\ncommon in Russia from Finland to the Crimea. Boissier received a\r\nspecimen of it from Dobrutscha, sent by the botanist Sintenis. The\r\nnatural habitat of the species borders, therefore, on that of _Allium\r\nsativum_, or else an attentive study of all these forms will show that a\r\nsingle species, comprising several varieties, extends over a great part\r\nof Europe and the bordering countries of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this species of onion does not appear to be of\r\nancient date. It is not mentioned by Greek and Roman authors, nor in the\r\nlist of plants recommended by Charlemagne to the intendants of his\r\ngardens.[259] Neither does Olivier de Serres speak of it. We can only\r\ngive a small number of original common names among ancient peoples. The\r\nmost distinctive are in the North. _Skovlög_ in Denmark, _keipe_ and\r\n_rackenboll_ in Sweden.[260] _Rockenbolle_, whence comes the French\r\nname, is German. It has not the meaning given by Littré. Its etymology\r\nis _Bolle_, onion, growing among the rocks, _Rocken_.[261]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Chives+—_Allium schœnoprasum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis species occupies an extensive area in the northern hemisphere. It\r\nis found all over Europe, from Corsica and Greece to the south of\r\nSweden, in Siberia as far as Kamtschatka, and also in North America, but\r\nonly near the Lakes Huron and Superior and further north[262]—a\r\nremarkable circumstance, considering its European habitat. The variety\r\nfound in the Alps is the nearest to the cultivated form.[263]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans must certainly have known the species,\r\nsince it is wild in Italy and Greece. Targioni believes it to be the\r\n_Scorodon schiston_ of Theophrastus; but we are dealing with words\r\nwithout descriptions, and authors whose specialty is the interpretation\r\nof Greek text like Fraas and Lenz, are prudent enough to affirm nothing.\r\nIf the ancient names are doubtful, the fact of the cultivation of the\r\nplant at this epoch is yet more so. It is possible that the custom of\r\ngathering it in the fields existed.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Colocasia+—_Arum esculentum_, Linnæus; _Colocasia antiquorum_,\r\nSchott.[264]\r\n\r\nThis species is cultivated in the damp districts of the tropics, for the\r\nswelled lower portion of the stem, which forms an edible rhizome similar\r\nto the subterraneous part of the iris. The petioles and the young leaves\r\nare also utilized as a vegetable. Since the different forms of the\r\nspecies have been properly classed, and since we have possessed more\r\ncertain information about the floras of the south of Asia, we cannot\r\ndoubt that this plant is wild in India, as Roxburgh[265] formerly, and\r\nWight[266] and others have more recently asserted; likewise in\r\nCeylon,[267] Sumatra,[268] and several islands of the Malay\r\nArchipelago.[269]\r\n\r\nChinese books make no mention of it before a work of the year 100\r\nB.C.[270] The first European navigators saw it cultivated in Japan and\r\nas far as the north of New Zealand,[271] in consequence probably of an\r\nearly introduction, and without the certain co-existence of wild stocks.\r\nWhen portions of the stem or of the tuber are thrown away by the side of\r\nstreams, they naturalize themselves easily. This was perhaps the case in\r\nJapan and the Fiji Islands,[272] judging from the localities indicated.\r\nThe colocasia is cultivated here and there in the West Indies, and\r\nelsewhere in tropical America, but much less than in Asia or Africa, and\r\nwithout the least indication of an American origin.\r\n\r\nIn the countries where the species is wild there are common names,\r\nsometimes very ancient, totally different from each other, which\r\nconfirms their local origin. Thus the Sanskrit name is _kuchoo_, which\r\npersists in modern Hindu languages—in Bengali, for instance.[273] In\r\nCeylon the wild plant is styled _gahala_, the cultivated plant\r\n_kandalla_.[274] The Malay names are _kelady_,[275] _tallus_, _tallas_,\r\n_tales_, or _taloes_,[276] from which perhaps comes the well-known name\r\nof the Otahitans and New Zealanders—_tallo_ or _tarro_,[277] _dalo_[278]\r\nin the Fiji Islands. The Japanese have a totally distinct name,\r\n_imo_,[279] which shows an existence of long duration either indigenous\r\nor cultivated.\r\n\r\nEuropean botanists first knew the colocasia in Egypt, where it has\r\nperhaps not been very long cultivated. The monuments of ancient Egypt\r\nfurnish no indication of it, but Pliny[280] spoke of it as the _Arum\r\nÆgyptium_. Prosper Alpin saw it in the sixteenth century, and speaks of\r\nit at length.[281] He says that its name in its country is _culcas_,\r\nwhich Delile[282] writes _qolkas_, and _koulkas_. It is clear that this\r\nArab name of the Egyptian arum has some analogy with the Sanskrit\r\n_kuchoo_, which is a confirmation of the hypothesis, sufficiently\r\nprobable, of an introduction from India or Ceylon. De l’Ecluse[283] had\r\nseen the plant cultivated in Portugal, as introduced from Africa, under\r\nthe name _alcoleaz_, evidently of Arab origin. In some parts of the\r\nsouth of Italy, where the plant has become naturalized, it is, according\r\nto Parlatore, called _aro di Egitto_.[284]\r\n\r\nThe name _colocasia_, given by the Greeks to a plant of which the root\r\nwas used by the Egyptians, may evidently come from _colcas_, but it has\r\nbeen transferred to a plant differing from the true colcas. Indeed,\r\nDioscorides applies it to the Egyptian bean, or _nelumbo_,[285] which\r\nhas a large root, or rather rhizome, rather stringy and not good to eat.\r\nThe two plants are very different, especially in the flower. The one\r\nbelongs to the _Araceæ_, the other to the _Nymphæaceæ_; the one belongs\r\nto the class of _Monocotyledons_, the other to that of the\r\n_Dicotyledons_. The nelumbo of Indian origin has ceased to grow in\r\nEgypt, while the colocasia of modern botanists has persisted there. If\r\nthere is any confusion, as seems probable in the Greek authors, it must\r\nbe explained by the fact that the colcas rarely flowers, at least in\r\nEgypt. From the point of view of botanical nomenclature, it matters\r\nlittle that mistakes were formerly made about the plants to which the\r\nname colocasia should be applied. Fortunately, modern scientific names\r\nare not based upon the doubtful definitions of the ancient Greeks and\r\nRomans, and it is sufficient to say now, if the etymology is insisted\r\nupon, that colocasia comes from colcas in consequence of an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Apé+, or +Large-rooted Alocasia+—_Alocasia macrorrhiza_, Schott; _Arum\r\nmacrorrhizum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis araceous plant, which Schott places now in the genus Colocasia, now\r\nin the Alocasia, and whose names are far more complicated than might be\r\nsupposed from those indicated above,[286] is less frequently cultivated\r\nthan the common colocasia, but in the same manner and nearly in the same\r\ncountries. Its rhizomes attain the length of a man’s arm. They have a\r\ndistinctly bitter taste, which it is indispensable to remove by cooking.\r\n\r\nThe aborigines of Otahiti call it _apé_, and those of the Friendly Isles\r\n_kappe_.[287] In Ceylon, the common name is _habara_, according to\r\nThwaites.[288] It has other names in the Malay Archipelago, which argues\r\nan existence prior to that of the more recent peoples of these regions.\r\n\r\nThe plant appears to be wild, especially in Otahiti.[289] It is also\r\nwild in Ceylon, according to Thwaites, who has studied botany for a\r\nlong time in that island. It is mentioned also in India[290] and in\r\nAustralia,[291] but its wild condition is not affirmed—a fact always\r\ndifficult to establish in the case of a species cultivated on the banks\r\nof streams, and which is propagated by bulbs. Moreover, it is sometimes\r\nconfounded with the _Colocasia indica_ of Kunth, which grows in the same\r\nmanner, and is found here and there in cultivated ground; and this\r\nspecies grows wild, or is naturalized in the ditches and streams of\r\nSouthern Asia, although its history is not yet well known.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Konjak+—_Amorphophallus Konjak_, Koch; _Amorphophallus Rivieri_, du\r\nRieu, var. _Konjak_, Engler.[292]\r\n\r\nThe konjak is a tuberous plant of the family Araceæ, extensively\r\ncultivated by the Japanese, a culture of which Vidal has given full\r\ndetails in the _Bulletin de la Société d’Acclimatation_ of July, 1877.\r\nIt is considered by Engler as a variety of _Amorphophallus Rivieri_, of\r\nCochin-China, of which horticultural periodicals have given several\r\nillustrations in the last few years.[293] It can be cultivated in the\r\nsouth of Europe, like the dahlia, as a curiosity; but to estimate the\r\nvalue of the bulbs as food, they should be prepared with lime-water, in\r\nJapanese fashion, so as to ascertain the amount of fecula which a given\r\narea will produce.\r\n\r\nDr. Vidal gives no proof that the Japanese plant is wild in that\r\ncountry. He supposes it to be so from the meaning of the common name,\r\nwhich is, he says, _konniyakou_ or _yamagonniyakou_, _yama_ meaning\r\n“mountain.” Franchet and Savatier[294] have only seen the plant in\r\ngardens. The Cochin-China variety, believed to belong to the same\r\nspecies, grows in gardens, and there is no proof of its being wild in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Yams+—_Dioscorea sativa_, _D. batatas_, _D. japonica_ and _D. alata_.\r\n\r\nThe yams, monocotyledonous plants, belonging to the family\r\n_Dioscorideæ_, constitute the genus _Dioscorea_, of which botanists have\r\ndescribed about two hundred species, scattered over all tropical and\r\nsub-tropical countries. They usually have rhizomes, that is, underground\r\nstems or branches of stems, more or less fleshy, which become larger\r\nwhen the annual, exposed part of the plant is near its decay.[295]\r\nSeveral species are cultivated in different countries for these\r\nfarinaceous rhizomes, which are cooked and eaten like potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe botanical distinction of the species has always presented\r\ndifficulties, because the male and female flowers are on different\r\nindividuals, and because the characters of the rhizomes and the lower\r\npart of the exposed stems cannot be studied in the herbarium. The last\r\ncomplete work is that of Kunth,[296] published in 1850. It requires\r\nrevision on account of the number of specimens brought home by\r\ntravellers in these last few years. Fortunately, with regard to the\r\norigin of cultivated species, certain historical and philological\r\nconsiderations will serve as a guide, without the absolute necessity of\r\nknowing and estimating the botanical characters of each.\r\n\r\nRoxburgh enumerates several _Dioscoreæ_[297] cultivated in India, but he\r\nfound none of them wild, and neither he nor Piddington[298] mentions\r\nSanskrit names. This last point argues a recent cultivation, or one of\r\noriginally small extent, in India, arising either from indigenous\r\nspecies as yet undefined, or from foreign species cultivated elsewhere.\r\nThe Bengali and Hindu generic name is _alu_, preceded by a special name\r\nfor each species or variety; _kam alu_, for instance, is _Dioscorea\r\nalata_. The absence of distinct names in each province also argues a\r\nrecent cultivation. In Ceylon, Thwaites[299] indicates six wild species,\r\nand he adds that _D. sativa_, L., _D. alata_, L., and _D. purpurea_,\r\nRoxb., are cultivated in gardens, but are not found wild.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese yam, _Dioscorea batatas_ of Decaisne,[300] extensively\r\ncultivated by the Chinese under the name of _Sain-in_, and introduced by\r\nM. de Montigny into European gardens, where it remains as a luxury, has\r\nnot hitherto been found wild in China. Other less-known species are also\r\ncultivated by the Chinese, especially the _chou-yu_, _tou-tchou_,\r\n_chan-yu_, mentioned in their ancient works on agriculture, and which\r\nhas spherical rhizomes (instead of the pyriform spindles of the _D.\r\nbatatas_). The names mean, according to Stanislas Julien, mountain arum,\r\nwhence we may conclude the plant is really a native of the country. Dr.\r\nBretschneider[301] gives three _Dioscoreæ_ as cultivated in China (_D.\r\nbatatas_, _alata_, _sativa_), adding, “The _Dioscorea_ is indigenous in\r\nChina, for it is mentioned in the oldest work on medicine, that of the\r\nEmperor Schen-nung.”\r\n\r\n_Dioscorea japonica_, Thunberg, cultivated in Japan, has also been found\r\nin clearings in various localities, but Franchet and Savatier[302] say\r\nthat it is not positively known to what degree it is wild or has strayed\r\nfrom cultivation. Another species, more often cultivated in Japan, grows\r\nhere and there in the country according to the same authors. They assign\r\nit to _Dioscorea sativa_ of Linnæus; but it is known that the famous\r\nSwede had confounded several Asiatic and American species under that\r\nname, which must either be abandoned or restricted to one of the species\r\nof the Indian Archipelago. If we choose the latter course, the true _D.\r\nsativa_ would be the plant cultivated in Ceylon with which Linnæus was\r\nacquainted, and which Thwaites calls the _D. sativa_ of Linnæus. Various\r\nauthors admitted the identity of the Ceylon plant with others cultivated\r\non the Malabar coast, in Sumatra, Java, the Philippine Isles, etc.\r\nBlume[303] asserts that _D. sativa_, L., to which he attributes pl. 51\r\nin Rheede’s _Hortus Malabaricus_, vol. viii., grows in damp places in\r\nthe mountains of Java and of Malabar. In order to put faith in these\r\nassertions, it would be necessary to have carefully studied the\r\nquestion of species from authentic specimens.\r\n\r\nThe yam, which is most commonly cultivated in the Pacific Isles under\r\nthe name _ubi_, is the _Dioscorea alata_ of Linnæus. The authors of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries speak of it as widely spread in\r\nTahiti, in New Guinea, in the Moluccas, etc.[304] It is divided into\r\nseveral varieties, according to the shape of the rhizome. No one\r\npretends to have found this species in a wild state, but the flora of\r\nthe islands whence it probably came, in particular that of Celebes and\r\nof New Guinea, is as yet little known.\r\n\r\nPassing to America, we find there also several species of this genus\r\ngrowing wild, in Brazil and Guiana, for instance, but it seems more\r\nprobable that the cultivated varieties were introduced. Authors indicate\r\nbut few cultivated species or varieties (Plumier one, Sloane two) and\r\nfew common names. The most widely spread is _yam_, _igname_, or\r\n_inhame_, which is of African origin, according to Hughes, and so also\r\nis the plant cultivated in his time in Barbados.[305]\r\n\r\nHe says that the word _yam_ means “to eat,” in several negro dialects on\r\nthe coast of Guinea. It is true that two travellers nearer to the date\r\nof the discovery of America, whom Humboldt quotes,[306] heard the word\r\n_igname_ pronounced on the American continent: Vespucci in 1497, on the\r\ncoast of Paria; Cabral in 1500, in Brazil. According to the latter, the\r\nname was given to a root of which bread was made, which would better\r\napply to the manioc, and leads me to think there must be some mistake,\r\nmore especially since a passage from Vespucci, quoted elsewhere by\r\nHumboldt,[307] shows the confusion he made between the manioc and the\r\nyam. _D. Cliffortiana_, Lam., grows wild in Peru[308] and in\r\nBrazil,[309] but it is not proved to be cultivated. Presl says\r\n_verosimiliter colitur_, and the _Flora Brasiliensis_ does not mention\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThe species chiefly cultivated in French Guiana, according to\r\nSagot,[310] is _Dioscoreæ triloba_, Lam., called Indian yam, which is\r\nalso common in Brazil and the West India Islands. The common name argues\r\na native origin, whereas another species, _D. cayennensis_, Kunth, also\r\ncultivated in Guiana, but under the name of _negro-country yam_, was\r\nmost likely brought from Africa, an opinion the more probable that Sir\r\nW. Hooker likens a yam cultivated in Africa on the banks of the Nun and\r\nthe Quorra,[311] to _D. cayennensis_. Lastly, the _free yam_ of Guiana\r\nis, according to Dr. Sagot, _D. alata_ introduced from the Malay\r\nArchipelago and Polynesia.\r\n\r\nIn Africa there are fewer indigenous _Dioscoreæ_ than in Asia and\r\nAmerica, and the culture of yams is less widely spread. On the west\r\ncoast, according to Thonning,[312] only one or two species are\r\ncultivated; Lockhardt[313] only saw one in Congo, and that only in one\r\nlocality. Bojer[314] mentions four cultivated species in Mauritius,\r\nwhich are, he says, of Asiatic origin, and one, _D. bulbifera_, Lam.,\r\nfrom India, if the name be correct. He asserts that it came from\r\nMadagascar, and has spread into the woods beyond the plantations. In\r\nMauritius it bears the name _Cambare marron_. Now, _cambare_ is\r\nsomething like the Hindu name _kam_, and _marron_ (marroon) indicates a\r\nplant escaped from cultivation. The ancient Egyptians cultivated no\r\nyams, which argues a cultivation less ancient in India than that of the\r\ncolocasia. Forskal and Delile mention no yams cultivated in Egypt at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: several _Dioscoreæ_ wild in Asia (especially in the Asiatic\r\nArchipelago), and others less numerous growing in America and in Africa,\r\nhave been introduced into cultivation as alimentary plants, probably\r\nmore recently than many other species. This last conjecture is based on\r\nthe absence of a Sanskrit name, on the limited geographical range of\r\ncultivation, and on the date, which appears to be not very ancient, of\r\nthe inhabitants of the Pacific Isles.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Arrowroot+—_Maranta arundinacea_, Linnæus. A plant of the family of the\r\n_Scitamineæ_, allied to the genus _Canna_, of which the underground\r\nsuckers[315] produce the excellent fecula called arrowroot. It is\r\ncultivated in the West India Islands and in several tropical countries\r\nof continental America. It has also been introduced into the old\r\nworld—on the coast of Guinea, for instance.[316]\r\n\r\n_Maranta arundinacea_ is certainly American. According to Sloane,[317]\r\nit was brought from Dominica to Barbados, and thence to Jamaica, which\r\nleads us to suppose that it was not indigenous in the West Indies.\r\nKörnicke, the last author who studied the genus Maranta,[318] saw\r\nseveral specimens which were gathered in Guadaloupe, in St. Thomas, in\r\nMexico, in Central America, in Guiana, and in Brazil; but he did not\r\nconcern himself to discover whether they were taken from wild,\r\ncultivated, or naturalized plants. Collectors hardly ever indicate this;\r\nand for the study of the American continent (excepting the United\r\nStates) we are unprovided with local floras, and especially with floras\r\nmade by botanists residing in the country. In published works I find the\r\nspecies mentioned as cultivated[319] or growing in plantations,[320] or\r\nwithout any explanation. A locality in Brazil, in the thinly peopled\r\nprovince of Matto Grosso, mentioned by Körnicke, supposes an absence of\r\ncultivation. Seemann[321] mentions that the species is found in sunny\r\nspots near Panama.\r\n\r\nA species is also cultivated in the West Indies, Maranta_ indica_,\r\nwhich, Tussac says, was brought from the East Indies. Körnicke believes\r\nthat _M. ramosissima_ of Wallich found at Sillet, in India, is the same\r\nspecies, and thinks it is a variety of _M. arundinacea_. Out of\r\nthirty-six more or less known species of the genus Maranta, thirty at\r\nleast are of American origin. It is therefore unlikely that two or three\r\nothers should be Asiatic. Until Sir Joseph Hooker’s _Flora of British\r\nIndia_ is completed, these questions on the species of the _Scitamineæ_\r\nand their origin will be very obscure.\r\n\r\nAnglo-Indians obtain arrowroot from another plant of the same family,\r\n_Curcuma angustifolia_, Roxburgh, which grows in the forests of the\r\nDeccan and in Malabar.[322] I do not know whether it is cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPLANTS CULTIVATED FOR THEIR STEMS OR LEAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Article I._—+Vegetables+.\r\n\r\n+Common Cabbage+—_Brassica oleracea_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe cabbage in its wild state, as it is represented in _Eng. Bot._, t.\r\n637, the _Flora Danica_, t. 2056, and elsewhere, is found on the rocks\r\nby the sea-shore: (1) in the Isle of Laland, in Denmark, the island of\r\nHeligoland, the south of England and Ireland, the Channel Isles, and the\r\nislands off the coast of Charente Inférieure;[323] (2) on the north\r\ncoast of the Mediterranean, near Nice, Genoa, and Lucca.[324] A\r\ntraveller of the last century, Sibthorp, said that he found it at Mount\r\nAthos, but this has not been confirmed by any modern botanist, and the\r\nspecies appears to be foreign in Greece, on the shores of the Caspian,\r\nas also in Siberia, where Pallas formerly said he had seen it, and in\r\nPersia.[325] Not only the numerous travellers who have explored these\r\ncountries have not found the cabbage, but the winters of the east of\r\nEurope and of Siberia appear to be too severe for it. Its distribution\r\ninto somewhat isolated places, and in two different regions of Europe,\r\nsuggests the suspicion either that plants apparently indigenous may in\r\nseveral cases be the result of self-sowing from cultivation,[326] or\r\nthat the species was formerly common, and is tending to disappear. Its\r\npresence in the western islands of Europe favours the latter hypothesis,\r\nbut its absence in the islands of the Mediterranean is opposed to\r\nit.[327]\r\n\r\nLet us see whether historical and philological data add anything to the\r\nfacts of geographical botany.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is in Europe that the countless varieties of\r\ncabbage have been formed,[328] principally since the days of the ancient\r\nGreeks. Theophrastus distinguished three, Pliny double that number,\r\nTournefort twenty, De Candolle more than thirty. These modifications did\r\nnot come from the East—another sign of an ancient cultivation in Europe\r\nand of a European origin.\r\n\r\nThe common names are also numerous in European languages, and rare or\r\nmodern in those of Asia. Without repeating a number of names I have\r\ngiven elsewhere,[329] I shall mention the five or six distinct and\r\nancient roots from which the European names are derived.\r\n\r\n_Kap_ or _kab_ in several Keltic and Slav names. The French name _cabus_\r\ncomes from it. Its origin is clearly the same as that of _caput_,\r\nbecause of the head-shaped form of the cabbage.\r\n\r\n_Caul_, _kohl_, in several Latin (_caulis_, stem or cabbage), German\r\n(_Chôli_ in Old German, _Kohl_ in modern German, _kaal_ in Danish), and\r\nKeltic languages (_kaol_ and _kol_ in Breton, _cal_ in Irish).[330]\r\n\r\n_Bresic_, _bresych_, _brassic_, of the Keltic and Latin (_brassica_)\r\nlanguages, whence, probably, _berza_ and _verza_ of the Spaniards and\r\nPortuguese, _varza_ of the Roumanians.[331]\r\n\r\n_Aza_ of the Basques (Iberians), considered by de Charencey[332] as\r\nproper to the Euskarian tongue, but which differs little from the\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\n_Krambai_, _crambe_, of the Greeks and Latins.\r\n\r\nThe variety of names in Keltic languages tends to show the existence of\r\nthe species on the west coast of Europe. If the Aryan Kelts had brought\r\nthe plant from Asia, they would probably not have invented names taken\r\nfrom three different sources. It is easy to admit, on the contrary, that\r\nthe Aryan nations, seeing the cabbage wild, and perhaps already used in\r\nEurope by the Iberians or the Ligurians, either invented names or\r\nadopted those of the earlier inhabitants.\r\n\r\nPhilologists have connected the _krambai_ of the Greeks with the Persian\r\nname _karamb_, _karam_, _kalam_, the Kurdish _kalam_, the Armenian\r\n_gaghamb_;[333] others with a root of the supposed mother-tongue of the\r\nAryans; but they do not agree in matters of detail. According to\r\nFick,[334] _karambha_, in the primitive Indo-Germanic tongue, signifies\r\n“_Gemüsepflanze_ (vegetable), _Kohl_ (cabbage), _karambha_ meaning\r\nstalk, like _caulis_.” He adds that _karambha_, in Sanskrit, is the name\r\nof two vegetables. Anglo-Indian writers do not mention this supposed\r\nSanskrit name, but only a name from a modern Hindu dialect,\r\n_kopee_.[335] Pictet, on his side, speaks of the Sanskrit word\r\n_kalamba_, “vegetable stalk, applied to the cabbage.”\r\n\r\nI have considerable difficulty, I must own, in admitting these Eastern\r\netymologies for the Greco-Latin word _crambe_. The meaning of the\r\nSanskrit word (if it exists) is very doubtful, and as to the Persian\r\nword, we ought to know if it is ancient. I doubt it, for if the cabbage\r\nhad existed in ancient Persia, the Hebrews would have known it.[336]\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons, the species appears to me of European origin. The\r\ndate of its cultivation is probably very ancient, earlier than the Aryan\r\ninvasions, but no doubt the wild plant was gathered before it was\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Garden-Cress+—_Lepidium sativum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis little Crucifer, now used as a salad, was valued in ancient times\r\nfor certain properties of the seeds. Some authors believe that it\r\nanswers to a certain _cardamon_ of Dioscorides; while others apply that\r\nname to _Erucaria aleppica_.[337] In the absence of sufficient\r\ndescription, as the modern common name is _cardamon_,[338] the first of\r\nthese two suppositions is probably correct.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the species must date from ancient times and be\r\nwidely diffused, for very different names exist: _reschad_ in Arab,\r\n_turehtezuk_[339] in Persian, _diéges_[340] in Albanian, a language\r\nderived from the Pelasgic; without mentioning names drawn from the\r\nsimilarity of taste with that of the water-cress (_Nasturtium\r\nofficinale_). There are very distinct names in Hindustani and Bengali,\r\nbut none are known in Sanskrit.[341]\r\n\r\nAt the present day the plant is cultivated in Europe, in the north of\r\nAfrica, in Eastern Asia, India, and elsewhere, but its origin is\r\nsomewhat obscure. I possess several specimens gathered in India, where\r\nSir Joseph Hooker[342] does not consider the species indigenous. Kotschy\r\nbrought it back from Karrak, or Karek Island, in the Persian Gulf. The\r\nlabel does not say that it was a cultivated plant. Boissier[343]\r\nmentions it without comment, and he afterwards speaks of specimens from\r\nIspahan and Egypt gathered in cultivated ground. Olivier is quoted as\r\nhaving found the cress in Persia, but it is not said whether it was\r\ngrowing wild.[344] It has been asserted that Sibthorp found it in\r\nCyprus, but reference to his work shows it was in the fields.[345] Poech\r\ndoes not mention it in Cyprus.[346] Unger and Kotschy[347] do not\r\nconsider it to be wild in that island. According to Ledebour,[348] Koch\r\nfound it round the convent on Mount Ararat; Pallas near Sarepta; Falk on\r\nthe banks of the Oka, a tributary of the Volga; lastly, H. Martius\r\nmentions it in his flora of Moscow; but there is no proof that it was\r\nwild in these various localities. Lindemann,[349] in 1860, did not\r\nreckon the species among those of Russia, and he only indicates it as\r\ncultivated in the Crimea.[350] According to Nyman,[351] the botanist\r\nSchur found it wild in Transylvania, while the Austro-Hungarian floras\r\neither do not mention the species, or give it as cultivated, or growing\r\nin cultivated ground.\r\n\r\nI am led to believe, by this assemblage of more or less doubtful facts,\r\nthat the plant is of Persian origin, whence it may have spread, after\r\nthe Sanskrit epoch, into the gardens of India, Syria, Greece, and Egypt,\r\nand even as far as Abyssinia.[352]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Purslane+—_Portulaca oleracea_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nPurslane is one of the kitchen garden plants most widely diffused\r\nthroughout the old world from the earliest times. It has been\r\ntransported into America,[353] where it spreads itself, as in Europe, in\r\ngardens, among rubbish, by the wayside, etc. It is more or less used as\r\na vegetable, a medicinal plant, and is excellent food for pigs.\r\n\r\nA Sanskrit name for it is known, _lonica_ or _lounia_, which recurs in\r\nthe modern languages of India.[354] The Greek name _andrachne_ and the\r\nLatin _portulaca_ are very different, as also the group of names,\r\n_cholza_ in Persian, _khursa_ or _koursa_ in Hindustani, _kourfa\r\nkara-or_ in Arab and Tartar, which seem to be the origin of _kurza noka_\r\nin Polish, _kurj-noha_ in Bohemian, _Kreusel_ in German, without\r\nspeaking of the Russian name _schrucha_, and some others of Eastern\r\nAsia.[355] One need not be a philologist to see certain derivations in\r\nthese names showing that the Asiatic peoples in their migrations\r\ntransported with them their names for the plant, but this does not prove\r\nthat they transported the plant itself. They may have found it in the\r\ncountries to which they came. On the other hand, the existence of three\r\nor four different roots shows that European peoples anterior to the\r\nAsiatic migrations had already names for the species, which is\r\nconsequently very ancient in Europe as well as in Asia.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to discover in the case of a plant so widely\r\ndiffused, and which propagates itself so easily by means of its enormous\r\nnumber of little seeds, whether a specimen is cultivated, naturalized by\r\nspreading from cultivation, or really wild.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear to be so ancient in the east as in the west of the\r\nAsiatic continent, and authors never say that it is a wild plant.[356]\r\nIn India the case is very different. Sir Joseph Hooker says[357] that it\r\ngrows in India to the height of five thousand feet in the Himalayas. He\r\nalso mentions having found in the north-west of India the variety with\r\nupright stem, which is cultivated together with the common species in\r\nEurope. I find nothing positive about the localities in Persia, but so\r\nmany are mentioned, and in countries so little cultivated, on the shores\r\nof the Caspian Sea, in the neighbourhood of the Caucasus, and even in\r\nthe south of Russia,[358] that it is difficult not to admit that the\r\nplant is indigenous in that central region whence the Asiatic peoples\r\noverran Europe. In Greece the plant is wild as well as cultivated.[359]\r\nFurther to the west, in Italy, etc., we begin to find it indicated in\r\nfloras, but only growing in fields, gardens, rubbish-heaps, and other\r\nsuspicious localities.[360]\r\n\r\nThus the evidence of philology and botany alike show that the species is\r\nindigenous in the whole of the region which extends from the western\r\nHimalayas to the south of Russia and Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\n+New Zealand Spinach+—_Tetragonia expansa_, Murray.\r\n\r\nThis plant was brought from New Zealand at the time of Cook’s famous\r\nvoyage, and cultivated by Sir Joseph Banks, and hence its name. It is a\r\nsingular plant from a double point of view. In the first place, it is\r\nthe only cultivated species which comes from New Zealand; and secondly,\r\nit belongs to an order of usually fleshy plants, the _Ficoideæ_, of\r\nwhich no other species is used. Horticulturists[361] recommend it as an\r\nannual vegetable, of which the taste resembles that of spinach, but\r\nwhich bears drought better, and is therefore a resource in seasons when\r\nspinach fails.\r\n\r\nSince Cook’s voyage it has been found wild chiefly on the sea coast, not\r\nonly in New Zealand but also in Tasmania, in the south and west of\r\nAustralia, in Japan, and in South America.[362] It remains to be\r\ndiscovered whether in the latter places it is not naturalized, for it is\r\nfound in the neighbourhood of towns in Japan and Chili.[363]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Garden Celery+—_Apium graveolens_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nLike many Umbellifers which grow in damp places, wild celery has a wide\r\nrange. It extends from Sweden to Algeria, Egypt, Abyssinia, and in Asia\r\nfrom the Caucasus to Beluchistan, and the mountains of British\r\nIndia.[364]\r\n\r\nIt is spoken of in the _Odyssey_ under the name of _selinon_, and in\r\nTheophrastus; but later, Dioscorides and Pliny[365] distinguish between\r\nthe wild and cultivated celery. In the latter the leaves are blanched,\r\nwhich greatly diminishes their bitterness. The long course of\r\ncultivation explains the numerous garden varieties. The one which\r\ndiffers more widely from the wild plant is that of which the fleshy\r\nroot is eaten cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Chervil+—_Scandix cerefolium_, Linnæus; _Anthriscus cerefolium_,\r\nHoffmann.\r\n\r\nNot long ago the origin of this little Umbellifer, so common in our\r\ngardens, was unknown. Like many annuals, it sprang up on rubbish-heaps,\r\nin hedges, in waste places, and it was doubted whether it should be\r\nconsidered wild. In the west and south of Europe it seems to have been\r\nintroduced, and more or less naturalized; but in the south-east of\r\nRussia and in western temperate Asia it appears to be indigenous.\r\nSteven[366] tells us that it is found “here and there in the woods of\r\nthe Crimea.” Boissier[367] received several specimens from the provinces\r\nto the south of the Caucasus, from Turcomania and the mountains of the\r\nnorth of Persia, localities of which the species is probably a native.\r\nIt is wanting in the floras of India and the east of Asia.\r\n\r\nGreek authors do not mention it. The first mention of the plant by\r\nancient writers occurs in Columella and Pliny,[368] that is, at the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era. It was then cultivated. Pliny calls it\r\n_cerefolium_. The species was probably introduced into the Greco-Roman\r\nworld after the time of Theophrastus, that is in the course of the three\r\ncenturies which preceded our era.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Parsley+—_Petroselinum sativum_, Mœnch.\r\n\r\nThis biennial Umbellifer is wild in the south of Europe, from Spain to\r\nTurkey. It has also been found at Tlemcen in Algeria, and in\r\nLebanon.[369]\r\n\r\nDioscorides and Pliny speak of it under the names of _Petroselinon_ and\r\n_Petroselinum_,[370] but only as a wild medicinal plant. Nothing proves\r\nthat it was cultivated in their time. In the Middle Ages Charlemagne\r\ncounted it among the plants which he ordered to be cultivated in his\r\ngardens.[371] Olivier de Serres in the sixteenth century cultivated\r\nparsley. English gardeners received it in 1548.[372] Although this\r\ncultivation is neither ancient nor important, it has already developed\r\ntwo varieties, which would be called species if they were found wild;\r\nthe parsley with crinkled leaves, and that of which the fleshy root is\r\nedible.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Smyrnium+, or +Alexanders+—_Smyrnium olus-atrum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nOf all the Umbellifers used as vegetables, this was one of the commonest\r\nin gardens for nearly fifteen centuries, and it is now abandoned. We can\r\ntrace its beginning and end. Theophrastus spoke of it as a medicinal\r\nplant under the name of _Ipposelinon_, but three centuries later\r\nDioscorides[373] says that either the root or the leaves might be eaten,\r\nwhich implies cultivation. The Latins called it _olus-atrum_,\r\nCharlemagne _olisatum_, and commanded it to be sown in his farms.[374]\r\nThe Italians made great use of it under the name _macerone_.[375] At the\r\nend of the eighteenth century the tradition existed in England that this\r\nplant had been formerly cultivated; later English and French\r\nhorticulturists do not mention it.[376]\r\n\r\nThe _Smyrnium olus-atrum_ is wild throughout Southern Europe, in\r\nAlgeria, Syria, and Asia Minor.[377]\r\n\r\n+Corn Salad+, or +Lamb’s Lettuce+—_Valerianella olitoria_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nFrequently cultivated as a salad, this annual, of the Valerian family,\r\nis found wild throughout temperate Europe to about the sixtieth degree\r\nof latitude, in Southern Europe, in the Canary Isles, Madeira, and the\r\nAzores, in the north of Africa, Asia Minor, and the Caucasus.[378] It\r\noften grows in cultivated ground, near villages, etc., which renders it\r\nsomewhat difficult to know where it grew before cultivation. It is\r\nmentioned, however, in Sardinia and Sicily, in the meadows and mountain\r\npastures.[379] I suspect that it is indigenous only in these islands,\r\nand that everywhere else it is introduced or naturalized. The grounds\r\nfor this opinion are the fact that no name which it seems possible to\r\nassign to this plant has been found in Greek or Latin authors. We cannot\r\neven name any botanist of the Middle Ages or of the sixteenth century\r\nwho has spoken of it. Neither is it mentioned among the vegetables used\r\nin France in the seventeenth century, either by the _Jardinier Français_\r\nof 1651, or by Laurenberg’s work, _Horticultura_ (Frankfurt, 1632). The\r\ncultivation and even the use of this salad appear to be modern, a fact\r\nwhich has not been noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Cardoon+—_Cynara cardunculus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\n+Artichoke+—_Cynara scolymus_, Linnæus; _C. cardunculus_, var. _sativa_,\r\nMoris.\r\n\r\nFor a long time botanists have held the opinion that the artichoke is\r\nprobably a form obtained by cultivation from the wild cardoon.[380]\r\nCareful observations have lately proved this hypothesis. Moris,[381] for\r\ninstance, having cultivated, in the garden at Turin, the wild Sardinian\r\nplant side by side with the artichoke, affirmed that true characteristic\r\ndistinctions no longer existed.\r\n\r\nWillkomm and Lange,[382] who have carefully observed the plant in Spain,\r\nboth wild and cultivated, share the same opinion. Moreover, the\r\nartichoke has not been found out of gardens; and since the Mediterranean\r\nregion, the home of all the _Cynaræ_, has been thoroughly explored, it\r\nmay safely be asserted that it exists nowhere wild.\r\n\r\nThe cardoon, in which we must also include _C. horrida_ of Sibthorp, is\r\nindigenous in Madeira and in the Canary Isles, in the mountains of\r\nMarocco near Mogador, in the south and east of the Iberian peninsula,\r\nthe south of France, of Italy, of Greece, and in the islands of the\r\nMediterranean Sea as far as Cyprus.[383] Munby[384] does not allow _C.\r\ncardunculus_ to be wild in Algeria, but he does admit _Cynara humilis_\r\nof Linnæus, which is considered by a few authors as a variety.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated cardoon varies a good deal with regard to the division of\r\nthe leaves, the number of spines, and the size—diversities which\r\nindicate long cultivation. The Romans eat the receptacle which bears the\r\nflowers, and the Italians also eat it, under the name of _girello_.\r\nModern nations cultivate the cardoon for the fleshy part of the leaves,\r\na custom which is not yet introduced into Greece.[385]\r\n\r\nThe artichoke offers fewer varieties, which bears out the opinion that\r\nit is a form derived from the cardoon. Targioni,[386] in an excellent\r\narticle upon this plant, relates that the artichoke was brought from\r\nNaples to Florence in 1466, and he proves that ancient writers, even\r\nAthenæus, were not acquainted with the artichoke, but only with the wild\r\nand cultivated cardoons. I must mention, however, as a sign of its\r\nantiquity in the north of Africa, that the Berbers have two entirely\r\ndistinct names for the two plants: _addad_ for the cardoon, _taga_ for\r\nthe artichoke.[387]\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the _kactos_, _kinara_, and _scolimos_ of the\r\nGreeks, and the _carduus_ of Roman horticulturists, were _Cynara\r\ncardunculus_,[388] although the most detailed description, that of\r\nTheophrastus, is sufficiently confused. “The plant,” he said, “grows in\r\nSicily”—as it does to this day—“and,” he added, “not in Greece.” It is,\r\ntherefore, possible that the plants observed in our day in that country\r\nmay have been naturalized from cultivation. According to Athenæus,[389]\r\nthe Egyptian king Ptolemy Energetes, of the second century before\r\nChrist, had found in Libya a great quantity of wild _kinara_, by which\r\nhis soldiers had profited.\r\n\r\nAlthough the indigenous species was to be found at such a little\r\ndistance, I am very doubtful whether the ancient Egyptians cultivated\r\nthe cardoon or the artichoke. Pickering and Unger[390] believed they\r\nrecognized it in some of the drawings on the monuments; but the two\r\nfigures which Unger considers the most admissible seem to me extremely\r\ndoubtful. Moreover, no Hebrew name is known, and the Jews would probably\r\nhave spoken of this vegetable had they seen it in Egypt. The diffusion\r\nof the species in Asia must have taken place somewhat late. There is an\r\nArab name, _hirschuff_ or _kerschouff_, and a Persian name,\r\n_kunghir_,[391] but no Sanskrit name, and the Hindus have taken the\r\nPersian word _kunjir_,[392] which shows that it was introduced at a late\r\nepoch. Chinese authors do not mention any _Cynara_.[393] The cultivation\r\nof the artichoke was only introduced into England in 1548.[394] One of\r\nthe most curious facts in the history of _Cynara cardanculus_ is its\r\nnaturalization in the present century over a vast extent of the Pampas\r\nof Buenos Ayres, where its abundance is a hindrance to travellers.[395]\r\nIt is becoming equally troublesome in Chili.[396] It is not asserted\r\nthat the artichoke has anywhere been naturalized in this manner, and\r\nthis is another sign of its artificial origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Lettuce+—_Latuca Scariola_, var. _sativa_.\r\n\r\nBotanists are agreed in considering the cultivated lettuce as a\r\nmodification of the wild species called _Latuca Scariola_.[397] The\r\nlatter grows in temperate and southern Europe, in the Canary Isles,\r\nMadeira,[398] Algeria,[399] Abyssinia,[400] and in the temperate\r\nregions of Eastern Asia. Boissier speaks of specimens from Arabia Petrea\r\nto Mesopotamia and the Caucasus.[401] He mentions a variety with\r\ncrinkled leaves, similar therefore to some of our garden lettuces, which\r\nthe traveller Hausknecht brought with him from the mountains of\r\nKurdistan. I have a specimen from Siberia, found near the river Irtysch,\r\nand it is now known with certainty that the species grows in the north\r\nof India, in Kashmir, and in Nepal.[402] In all these countries it is\r\noften near cultivated ground or among rubbish, but often also in rocky\r\nground, clearings, or meadows, as a really wild plant.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated lettuce often spreads from gardens, and sows itself in\r\nthe open country. No one, as far as I know, has observed it in such a\r\ncase for several generations, or has tried to cultivate the wild _L.\r\nScariola_, to see whether the transition is easy from the one form to\r\nthe other. It is possible that the original habitat of the species has\r\nbeen enlarged by the diffusion of cultivated lettuces reverting to the\r\nwild form. It is known that there has been a great increase in the\r\nnumber of cultivated varieties in the course of the last two thousand\r\nyears. Theophrastus indicated three;[403] _le Bon Jardinier_ of 1880\r\ngives forty varieties existing in France.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans cultivated the lettuce, especially as a\r\nsalad. In the East its cultivation possibly dates from an earlier epoch.\r\nNevertheless it does not appear, from the original common names both in\r\nAsia and Europe, that this plant was generally or very anciently\r\ncultivated. There is no Sanskrit nor Hebrew name known, nor any in the\r\nreconstructed Aryan tongue. A Greek name exists, _tridax_; Latin,\r\n_latuca_; Persian and Hindu, _kahn_; and the analogous Arabic form\r\n_chuss_ or _chass_. The Latin form exists also, slightly modified, in\r\nthe Slav and Germanic languages,[404] which may indicate either that the\r\nWestern Aryans diffused the plant, or that its cultivation spread with\r\nits name at a later date from the south to the north of Europe.\r\n\r\nDr. Bretschneider has confirmed my supposition[405] that the lettuce is\r\nnot very ancient in China, and that it was introduced there from the\r\nWest. He says that the first work in which it is mentioned dates from\r\nA.D. 600 to A.D. 900.[406]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Wild Chicory+—_Cichorium Intybus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe wild perennial chicory, which is cultivated as a salad, as a\r\nvegetable, as fodder, and for its roots, which are used to mix with\r\ncoffee, grows throughout Europe, except in Lapland, in Marocco, and\r\nAlgeria,[407] from Eastern Europe to Afghanistan and Beluchistan,[408]\r\nin the Punjab and Kashmir,[409] and from Russia to Lake Baikal in\r\nSiberia.[410] The plant is certainly wild in most of these countries;\r\nbut as it often grows by the side of roads and fields, it is probable\r\nthat it has been transported by man from its original home. This must be\r\nthe case in India, for there is no known Sanskrit name.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks and Romans employed this species wild and cultivated,[411]\r\nbut their notices of it are too brief to be clear. According to\r\nHeldreich, the modern Greeks apply the general name of _lachana_, a\r\nvegetable or salad, to seventeen different chicories, of which he gives\r\na list.[412] He says that the species commonly cultivated is _Cichorium\r\ndivaricatum_, Schousboe (_C. pumilum_, Jacquin); but it is an annual,\r\nand the chicory of which Theophrastus speaks was perennial.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Endive+—_Cichorium Endivia_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe white chicories or endives of our gardens are distinguished from\r\n_Cichorium Intybus_, in that they are annuals, and less bitter to the\r\ntaste. Moreover, the hairs of the pappus which crowns the seed are four\r\ntimes longer, and unequal instead of being equal. As long as this plant\r\nwas compared with _C. Intybus_, it was difficult not to admit two\r\nspecies. The origin of _C. Endivia_ is uncertain. When we received,\r\nforty years ago, specimens of an Indian _Cichorium_, which Hamilton\r\nnamed _C. cosmia_, they seemed to us so like the endive that we supposed\r\nthe latter to have an Indian origin, as has been sometimes\r\nsuggested;[413] but Anglo-Indian botanists said, and continue to assert,\r\nthat in India the plant only grows under cultivation.[414] The\r\nuncertainty persisted as to the geographical origin. After this, several\r\nbotanists[415] conceived the idea of comparing the endive with an annual\r\nspecies, wild in the region of the Mediterranean, _Cichorium pumilum_,\r\nJacquin (_C. divaricatum_, Schousboe), and the differences were found to\r\nbe so slight that some have suspected, and others have affirmed, their\r\nspecific identity. For my part, after having seen wild specimens from\r\nSicily, and compared the good illustrations published by Reichenbach\r\n(_Icones_, vol. xix., pls. 1357, 1358), I am disposed to take the\r\ncultivated endives for varieties of the same species as _C. pumilum_. In\r\nthis case the oldest name being _C. Endivia_, it is the one which ought\r\nto be retained, as has been done by Schultz. It resembles, moreover, a\r\npopular name common to several languages.\r\n\r\nThe wild plant exists in the whole region, of which the Mediterranean is\r\nthe centre, from Madeira,[416] Marocco,[417] and Algeria,[418] as far as\r\nPalestine,[419] the Caucasus, and Turkestan.[420] It is very common in\r\nthe islands of the Mediterranean and in Greece. Towards the west, in\r\nSpain and Madeira, for instance, it is probable that it has become\r\nnaturalized from cultivation, judging from the positions it occupies in\r\nthe fields and by the wayside.\r\n\r\nNo positive proof is found in ancient authors of the use of this plant\r\nby the Greeks and Romans;[421] but it is probable that they made use of\r\nit and several other _Cichoria_. The common names tell us nothing, since\r\nthey may have been applied to two different species. These names vary\r\nlittle,[422] and suggest a cultivation of Græco-Roman origin. A Hindu\r\nname, _kasni_, and a Tamul one, _koschi_,[423] are mentioned, but no\r\nSanskrit name, and this indicates that the cultivation of this plant was\r\nof late origin in the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Spinach+—_Spinacia oleracea_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis vegetable was unknown to the Greeks and Romans.[424] It was new to\r\nEurope in the sixteenth century,[425] and it has been a matter of\r\ndispute whether it should be called _spanacha_, as coming from Spain, or\r\n_spinacia_, from its prickly fruit.[426] It was afterwards shown that\r\nthe name comes from the Arabic _isfânâdsch_, _esbanach_, or _sepanach_,\r\naccording to different authors.[427] The Persian name is _ispany_, or\r\n_ispanaj_,[428] and the Hindu _isfany_, or _palak_, according to\r\nPiddington, and also _pinnis_, according to the same and to Roxburgh.\r\nThe absence of any Sanskrit name shows a cultivation of no great\r\nantiquity in these regions. Loureiro saw the spinach cultivated at\r\nCanton, and Maximowicz in Mantschuria;[429] but Bretschneider tells us\r\nthat the Chinese name signifies _herb of Persia_, and that Western\r\nvegetables were commonly introduced into China a century before the\r\nChristian era.[430] It is therefore probable that the cultivation of\r\nthis plant began in Persia from the time of the Græco-Roman\r\ncivilization, or that it did not quickly spread either to the east or to\r\nthe west of its Persian origin. No Hebrew name is known, so that the\r\nArabs must have received both plant and name from the Persians. Nothing\r\nleads us to suppose that they carried this vegetable into Spain. Ebn\r\nBaithar, who was living in 1235, was of Malaga; but the Arabic works he\r\nquotes do not say where the plant was cultivated, except one of them,\r\nwhich says that its cultivation was common at Nineveh and Babylon.\r\nHerrera’s work on Spanish agriculture does not mention the species,\r\nalthough it is inserted in a supplement of recent date, whence it is\r\nprobable that the edition of 1513 did not speak of it; so that the\r\nEuropean cultivation must have come from the East about the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nSome popular works repeat that spinach is a native of Northern Asia, but\r\nthere is nothing to confirm this supposition. It evidently comes from\r\nthe empire of the ancient Medes and Persians. According to Bosc,[431]\r\nthe traveller, Olivier brought back some seeds of it, found in the East\r\nin the open country. This would be a positive proof, if the produce of\r\nthese seeds had been examined by a botanist in order to ascertain the\r\nspecies and the variety. In the present state of our knowledge it must\r\nbe owned that spinach has not yet been found in a wild state, unless it\r\nbe a cultivated modification of _Spinacia tetandra_, Steven, which is\r\nwild to the south of the Caucasus, in Turkestan, in Persia, and in\r\nAfghanistan, and which is used as a vegetable under the name of\r\n_schamum_.[432]\r\n\r\nWithout entering here into a purely botanical discussion, I may say\r\nthat, after reading the descriptions quoted by Boissier, and looking at\r\nWight’s[433] plate of _Spinacia tetandra_, Roxb., cultivated in India,\r\nand the specimens of several herbaria, I see no decided difference\r\nbetween this plant and the cultivated spinach with prickly fruit. The\r\nterm _tetandra_ implies that one of the plants has five and the other\r\nfour stamens, but the number varies in our cultivated spinaches.[434]\r\n\r\nIf, as seems probable, the two plants are two varieties, the one\r\ncultivated, the other sometimes wild and sometimes cultivated, the\r\noldest name, _S. oleracea_, ought to persist, especially as the two\r\nplants are found in the cultivated grounds of their original country.\r\n\r\nThe _Dutch_ or _great spinach_, of which the fruit has no spines, is\r\nevidently a garden product. Tragus, or Bock was the first to mention it\r\nin the sixteenth century.[435]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Amaranth+—_Amarantus gangeticus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nSeveral annual amaranths are cultivated as a green vegetable in\r\nMauritius, Bourbon, and the Seychelles Isles, under the name of _brède\r\nde Malabar_.[436] This appears to be the principal species. It is much\r\ncultivated in India. Anglo-Indian botanists mistook it for a time for\r\n_Amarantus oleraceus_ of Linnæus, and Wight gives an illustration of it\r\nunder this name,[437] but it is now acknowledged to be a different\r\nspecies, and belongs to _A. gangeticus_. Its numerous varieties,\r\ndiffering in size, colour, etc., are called in the Telinga dialect _tota\r\nkura_, with the occasional addition of an adjective for each. There\r\nare other names in Bengali and Hindustani. The young shoots sometimes\r\ntake the place of asparagus at the table of the English.[438] _A.\r\nmelancholicus_, often grown as an ornamental plant in European gardens,\r\nis considered one of the forms of this species.\r\n\r\nIts original home is perhaps India, but I cannot discover that the plant\r\nhas ever been found there in a wild state; at least, this is not\r\nasserted by any author. All the species of the genus _Amarantus_ spread\r\nthemselves in cultivated ground, on rubbish-heaps by the wayside, and\r\nthus become half-naturalized in hot countries as well as in Europe.\r\nHence the extreme difficulty in distinguishing the species, and above\r\nall in guessing or proving their origin. The species most nearly akin to\r\n_A. gangeticus_ appear to be Asiatic.\r\n\r\n_A. gangeticus_ is said by trustworthy authorities to be wild in Egypt\r\nand Abyssinia;[439] but this is perhaps only the result of such\r\nnaturalization as I spoke of just now. The existence of numerous\r\nvarieties and of different names in India, render its Indian origin most\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese cultivate as vegetables _A. caudatus_, _A. mangostanus_,\r\nand _A. melancholicus_ (or _gangeticus_) of Linnæus,[440] but there is\r\nno proof that any of them are indigenous. In Java _A. polystachyus_,\r\nBlume, is cultivated; it is very common among rubbish, by the wayside,\r\netc.[441]\r\n\r\nI shall speak presently of the species grown for the seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Leek+—_Allium ampeloprasum_, var. _Porrum_.\r\n\r\nAccording to the careful monograph by J. Gay,[442] the leek, as early\r\nwriters[443] suspected, is only a cultivated variety of _Allium\r\nampeloprasum_ of Linnæus, so common in the East, and in the\r\nMediterranean region, especially in Algeria, which in Central Europe\r\nsometimes becomes naturalized in vineyards and round ancient\r\ncultivations.[444] Gay seems to have mistrusted the indications of the\r\nfloras of the south of Europe, for, contrary to his method with other\r\nspecies of which he gives the localities out of Algeria, he only quotes\r\nin the present case the Algerian localities; admitting, however, the\r\nidentity of name in the authors for other countries.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated variety of _Porrum_ has not been found wild. It is only\r\nmentioned in doubtful localities, such as vineyards, gardens, etc.\r\nLedebour[445] indicates for _A. ampeloprasum_ the borders of the Crimea,\r\nand the provinces to the south of the Caucasus. Wallich brought a\r\nspecimen from Kamaon, in India,[446] but we cannot be sure that it was\r\nwild. The works on Cochin-China (Loureiro), China (Bretschneider), and\r\nJapan (Franchet and Savatier) make no mention of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Article II._—+Fodder.+\r\n\r\n\r\n+Lucern+—_Medicago sativa_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe lucern was known to the Greeks and Romans. They called it in Greek\r\n_medicai_, in Latin medica, or _herba medica_, because it had been\r\nbrought from Media at the time of the Persian war, about 470 years\r\nbefore the Christian era.[447] The Romans often cultivated it, at any\r\nrate from the beginning of the first or second century. Cato does not\r\nspeak of it,[448] but it is mentioned by Varro, Columella, and Virgil.\r\nDe Gasparin[449] notices that Crescenz, in 1478, does not mention it in\r\nItaly, and that in 1711 Tull had not seen it beyond the Alps. Targioni,\r\nhowever, who could not be mistaken on this head, says that the\r\ncultivation of lucern was maintained in Italy, especially in Tuscany,\r\nfrom ancient times.[450] It is rare in modern Greece.[451] French\r\ncultivators have often given to the lucern the name of _sainfoin_, which\r\nbelongs properly to _Onobrychis sativa_; and this transposition still\r\nexists, for instance in the neighbourhood of Geneva. The name _lucern_\r\nhas been supposed to come from the valley of Luzerne, in Piedmont; but\r\nthere is another and more probable origin. The Spaniards had an old\r\nname, _eruye_, mentioned by J. Bauhin,[452] and the Catalans call it\r\n_userdas_[453] whence perhaps the patois name in the south of France,\r\n_laouzerdo_, nearly akin to _luzerne_. It was so commonly cultivated in\r\nSpain that the Italians have sometimes called it _herba spagna_.[454]\r\nThe Spaniards have, besides the names already given, _mielga_, or\r\n_melga_, which appears to come from _Medica_, but they principally used\r\nnames derived from the Arabic—_alfafa_, _alfasafat_, _alfalfa_. In the\r\nthirteenth century, the famous physician Ebn Baithar, who wrote at\r\nMalaga, uses the Arab word _fisfisat_, which he derives from the Persian\r\n_isfist_.[455] It will be seen that, if we are to trust to the common\r\nnames, the origin of the plant would be either in Spain, Piedmont, or\r\nPersia. Fortunately botanists can furnish direct and possible proofs of\r\nthe original home of the species.\r\n\r\nIt has been found wild, with every appearance of an indigenous plant, in\r\nseveral provinces of Anatolia, to the south of the Caucasus, in several\r\nparts of Persia, in Afghanistan, in Beluchistan,[456] and in\r\nKashmir.[457] In the south of Russia, a locality mentioned by some\r\nauthors, it is perhaps the result of cultivation as well as in the south\r\nof Europe. The Greeks may, therefore, have introduced the plant from\r\nAsia Minor as well as from India, which extended from the north of\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\nThis origin of the lucern, which is well established, makes me note as a\r\nsingular fact that no Sanskrit name is known.[458] Clover and sainfoin\r\nhave none either, which leads us to suppose that the Aryans had no\r\nartificial meadows.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Sainfoin+—_Hedysarum Onobrychis_, Linnæus; _Onobrychis sativa_,\r\nLamarck.\r\n\r\nThis leguminous plant, of which the usefulness in the dry and chalky\r\nsoils of temperate regions is incontestable, has not been long in\r\ncultivation. The Greeks did not grow it, and their descendants have not\r\nintroduced it into their agriculture to this day.[459] The plant called\r\n_Onobrychis_ by Dioscorides and Pliny, is _Onobrychis Caput-Galli_ of\r\nmodern botanists,[460] a species wild in Greece and elsewhere, which is\r\nnot cultivated. The sainfoin, or _lupinella_ of the Italians, was highly\r\nesteemed as fodder in the south of France in the time of Olivier de\r\nSerres,[461] that is to say, in the sixteenth century; but in Italy it\r\nwas only in the eighteenth century that this cultivation spread,\r\nparticularly in Tuscany.[462]\r\n\r\nSainfoin is a herbaceous plant, which grows wild in the temperate parts\r\nof Europe, to the south of the Caucasus, round the Caspian Sea,[463] and\r\neven beyond Lake Baikal.[464] In the south of Europe it grows only on\r\nthe hills. Gussone does not reckon it among the wild species of Sicily,\r\nnor Moris among those of Sardinia, nor Munby among those of Algeria.\r\n\r\nNo Sanskrit, Persian, or Arabic names are known. Everything tends to\r\nshow that the cultivation of this plant originated in the south of\r\nFrance as late perhaps as the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n+French Honeysuckle+, or +Spanish Sainfoin+—_Hedysarum coronarium_,\r\nLinnæus.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this leguminous plant, akin to the sainfoin, and of\r\nwhich a good illustration may be found in the _Flora des Serres et des\r\nJardins_, vol. xiii. pl. 1382, has been diffused in modern times through\r\nItaly, Sicily, Malta, and the Balearic Isles.[465] Marquis Grimaldi, who\r\nfirst pointed it out to cultivators in 1766, had seen it at Seminara,\r\nin Lower Calabria; De Gasparin[466] recommends it for Algeria, and it is\r\nprobable that cultivators under similar conditions in Australia, at the\r\nCape, in South America or Mexico, would do well to try it. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Orange, in Algeria, the plant did not survive the cold\r\nof 6° centigrade.\r\n\r\n_Hedysarum coronarium_ grows in Italy from Genoa to Sicily and\r\nSardinia,[467] in the south of Spain[468] and in Algeria,[469] where it\r\nis rare. It is, therefore, a species of limited geographical area.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Purple Clover+—_Trifolium pratense_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nClover was not cultivated in ancient times, although the plant was\r\ndoubtless known to nearly all the peoples of Europe and of temperate\r\nWestern Asia. Its use was first introduced into Flanders in the\r\nsixteenth century, perhaps even earlier, and, according to Schwerz, the\r\nProtestants expelled by the Spaniards carried it into Germany, where\r\nthey established themselves under the protection of the Elector\r\nPalatine. It was also from Flanders that the English received it in\r\n1633, through the influence of Weston, Earl of Portland, then Lord\r\nChancellor.[470]\r\n\r\n_Trifolium pratense_ is wild throughout Europe, in Algeria,[471] on the\r\nmountains of Anatolia, in Armenia, and in Turkestan,[472] in Siberia\r\ntowards the Altaï Mountains,[473] and in Kashmir and Garwhall.[474]\r\n\r\nThe species existed, therefore, in Asia, in the land of the Aryan\r\nnations; but no Sanskrit name is known, whence it may be inferred that\r\nit was not cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Crimson+ or +Italian Clover+—_Trifolium incarnatum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nAn annual plant grown for fodder, whose cultivation, says Vilmorin, long\r\nconfined to a few of the southern departments, becomes every day more\r\ncommon in France.[475] De Candolle, at the beginning of the present\r\ncentury, had only seen it in the department of Ariège.[476] It has\r\nexisted for about sixty years in the neighbourhood of Geneva. Targioni\r\ndoes not think that it is of ancient date in Italy,[477] and the trivial\r\nname _trafoglio_ strengthens his opinion.\r\n\r\nThe Catalan _fé_, _fench_,[478] and, in the patois of the south of\r\nFrance,[479] _farradje_ (Roussillon), _farratage_ (Languedoc),\r\n_feroutgé_ (Gascony), whence the French name _farouch_, have, on the\r\nother hand, an original character, which indicates an ancient\r\ncultivation round the Pyrenees. The term which is sometimes used,\r\n“clover of Roussillon,” also shows this.\r\n\r\nThe wild plant exists in Galicia, in Biscaya, and Catalonia,[480] but\r\nnot in the Balearic Isles;[481] it is found in Sardinia[482] and in the\r\nprovince of Algiers.[483] It appears in several localities in France,\r\nItaly, and Dalmatia, in the valley of the Danube and Macedonia, but in\r\nmany cases it is not known whether it may not have strayed from\r\nneighbouring cultivation. A singular locality in which it appears to be\r\nindigenous, according to English authors, is on the coast of Cornwall,\r\nnear the Lizard. In this place, according to Bentham, it is the pale\r\nyellow variety, which is truly wild on the Continent, while the crimson\r\nvariety is only naturalized in England from cultivation.[484] I do not\r\nknow to what degree this remark of Bentham’s as to the wild nature of\r\nthe sole variety of a yellow colour (var. _Molinerii_, Seringe) is\r\nconfirmed in all the countries where the species grows. It is the only\r\none indicated by Moris in Sardinia, and in Dalmatia by Viviani,[485] in\r\nthe localities which appear natural (_in pascuis collinis_, _in\r\nmontanis_, _in herbidis_). The authors of the _Bon Jardinier_[486]\r\naffirm with Bentham that _Trifolium Molinerii_ is wild in the north of\r\nFrance, that with crimson flowers being introduced from the south; and\r\nwhile they admit the absence of a good specific distinction, they note\r\nthat in cultivation the variety _Molinerii_ is of slower growth, often\r\nbiennial instead of annual.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Alexandrine+ or +Egyptian Clover+—_Trifolium Alexandrinum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis species is extensively cultivated in Egypt as fodder. Its Arab name\r\nis _bersym_ or _berzun_.[487] There is nothing to show that it has been\r\nlong in use; the name does not occur in Hebrew and Armenian botanical\r\nworks. The species is not wild in Egypt, but it is certainly wild in\r\nSyria and Asia Minor.[488]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Ervilia+—_Ervum Ervilia_, Linnæus; _Vicia Ervilia_, Willdenow.\r\n\r\nBertoloni[489] gives no less than ten common Italian names—_ervo_,\r\n_lero_, _zirlo_, etc. This is an indication of an ancient and general\r\nculture. Heldreich[490] says that the modern Greeks cultivate the plant\r\nin abundance as fodder. They call it _robai_, from the ancient Greek\r\n_orobos_, as _ervos_ comes from the Latin _ervum_. The cultivation of\r\nthe species is mentioned by ancient Greek and Latin authors.[491] The\r\nGreeks made use of the seed; for some has been discovered in the\r\nexcavations on the site of Troy.[492] There are a number of common names\r\nin Spain, some of them Arabic,[493] but the species has not been so\r\nwidely cultivated there for several centuries.[494] In France it is so\r\nlittle grown that many modern works on agriculture do not mention it. It\r\nis unknown in British India.[495]\r\n\r\nGeneral botanical works indicate _Ervum Ervilia_ as growing in Southern\r\nEurope, but if we take severally the best floras, it will be seen that\r\nit is in such localities as fields, vineyards, or cultivated ground. It\r\nis the same in Western Asia, where Boissier[496] speaks of specimens\r\nfrom Syria, Persia, and Afghanistan. Sometimes, in abridged\r\ncatalogues,[497] the locality is not given, but nowhere do I find it\r\nasserted that the plant has been seen wild in places far from\r\ncultivation. The specimens in my own herbarium furnish no further proof\r\non this head.\r\n\r\nIn all likelihood the species was formerly wild in Greece, Italy, and\r\nperhaps Spain and Algeria, but the frequency of its cultivation in the\r\nvery regions where it existed prevent us from now finding the wild\r\nstocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Tare+, or +Common Vetch+—_Vicia sativa_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\n_Vicia sativa_ is an annual leguminous plant wild throughout Europe,\r\nexcept in Lapland. It is also common in Algeria,[498] and to the south\r\nof the Caucasus as far as the province of Talysch.[499] Roxburgh\r\npronounces it to be wild in the north-west provinces and in Bengal, but\r\nSir Joseph Hooker admits this only as far as the variety called\r\n_angustifolia_[500] is concerned. No Sanskrit name is known, and in the\r\nmodern languages of India only Hindu names.[501] Targioni believes it to\r\nbe the _ketsach_ of the Hebrews.[502] I have received specimens from the\r\nCape and from California. The species is certainly not indigenous in the\r\ntwo last-named regions, but has escaped from cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe Romans sowed this plant both for the sake of the seed and as fodder\r\nas early as the time of Cato.[503] I have discovered no proof of a more\r\nancient cultivation. The name _vik_, whence _vicia_, dates from a very\r\nremote epoch in Europe, for it exists in Albanian,[504] which is\r\nbelieved to be the language of the Pelasgians, and among the Slav,\r\nSwedish, and Germanic nations, with slight modifications. This does not\r\nprove that the species was cultivated. It is distinct enough and useful\r\nenough to herbivorous animals to have received common names from the\r\nearliest times.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Flat-podded Pea+—_Lathyrus Cicera_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nAn annual leguminous plant, esteemed as fodder, but whose seed, if used\r\nas food in any quantity, becomes dangerous.[505]\r\n\r\nIt is grown in Italy under the name of _mochi_.[506] Some authors\r\nsuspect that it is the _cicera_ of Columella and the _ervilia_ of\r\nVarro,[507] but the common Italian name is very different to these. The\r\nspecies is not cultivated in Greece.[508] It is more or less grown in\r\nFrance and Spain, without anything to show that its use dates from\r\nancient times. However, Wittmack[509] attributes to it, but doubtfully,\r\nsome seeds brought by Virchow from the Trojan excavations.\r\n\r\nAccording to the floras, it is evidently wild in dry places, beyond the\r\nlimits of cultivation in Spain and Italy.[510] It is also wild in Lower\r\nEgypt, according to Schweinfurth and Ascherson;[511] but there is no\r\ntrace of ancient cultivation in this country or among the Hebrews.\r\nTowards the East its wild character becomes less certain. Boissier\r\nindicates the plant “in cultivated ground from Turkey in Europe, and\r\nEgypt as far as the south of the Caucasus and Babylon.”[512] It is not\r\nmentioned in India either as wild or cultivated, and has no Sanskrit\r\nname.[513]\r\n\r\nThe species is probably a native of the region comprised between Spain\r\nand Greece, perhaps also of Algeria,[514] and diffused by a\r\ncultivation, not of very ancient date, over Western Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Chickling Vetch+—_Lathyrus sativus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nAn annual leguminous plant, cultivated in the South of Europe, from a\r\nvery early age, as fodder, and also for the seeds. The Greeks called it\r\n_lathyros_[515] and the Latins _cicercula_.[516] It is also cultivated\r\nin the temperate regions of Western Asia, and even in the north of\r\nIndia;[517] but it has no Hebrew[518] nor Sanskrit name,[519] which\r\nargues a not very ancient cultivation in these regions.\r\n\r\nNearly all the floras of the south of Europe and of Algeria give the\r\nplant as cultivated and half-wild, rarely and only in a few localities\r\nas truly wild. It is easy to understand the difficulty of recognizing\r\nthe wild character of a species often mixed with cereals, and which\r\npersists and spreads itself after cultivation. Heldreich does not allow\r\nthat it is indigenous in Greece.[520] This is a strong presumption that\r\nin the rest of Europe and in Algeria the plant has escaped from\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this was not the case in Western Asia; for authors\r\ncite sufficiently wild localities, where agriculture plays a less\r\nconsiderable part than in Europe. Ledebour,[521] for instance, mentions\r\nspecimens gathered in the desert, near the Caspian Sea, and in the\r\nprovince of Lenkoran. Meyer[522] confirms the assertion with respect to\r\nLenkoran. Baker, in his flora of British India, after indicating the\r\nspecies as scattered here and there in the northern provinces, adds,\r\n“often cultivated,” whence it may be inferred that he considers it as\r\nindigenous, at least in the north. Boissier asserts nothing with regard\r\nto the localities in Persia which he mentions in his Oriental\r\nflora.[523]\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I think it probable that the species was indigenous before\r\ncultivation in the region extending from the south of the Caucasus, or\r\nof the Caspian Sea, to the north of India, and that it spread towards\r\nEurope in the track of ancient cultivation, mixed perhaps with cereals.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Ochrus+—_Pisum ochrus_, Linnæus; _Lathyrus ochrus_, de Candolle.\r\n\r\nCultivated as an annual fodder in Catalonia, under the name of\r\n_tapisots_,[524] and in Greece, particularly in the island of Crete,\r\nunder that of _ochros_,[525] mentioned by Theophrastus,[526] but without\r\na word of description. Latin authors do not speak of it, which argues a\r\nrare and local cultivation in ancient times.\r\n\r\nThe species is certainly wild in Tuscany.[527] It appears to be wild\r\nalso in Greece and Sardinia, where it is found in hedges,[528] and in\r\nSpain, where it grows in uncultivated ground;[529] but as for the south\r\nof France, Algeria, and Sicily, authors are either silent as to the\r\nlocality, or mention only fields and cultivated ground. The plant is\r\nunknown further east than Syria,[530] where probably it is not wild.\r\n\r\nThe fine plate published by Sibthorp, _Flora Græca_, 589, suggests that\r\nthe species is worthy of more general cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Trigonel+, or +Fenugreek+—Trigonella fænum-græcum, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this annual leguminous plant was common in ancient\r\nGreece and Italy,[531] either for spring forage, or for the medicinal\r\nproperties of its seeds. Abandoned almost everywhere in Europe, and\r\nnotably in Greece,[532] it is maintained in the East and in India,[533]\r\nwhere it is probably of very ancient date, and throughout the Nile\r\nValley.[534] The species is wild in the Punjab and in Kashmir,[535] in\r\nthe deserts of Mesopotamia and of Persia,[536] and in Asia Minor,[537]\r\nwhere, however, the localities cited do not appear sufficiently distinct\r\nfrom the cultivated ground. It is also indicated[538] in several places\r\nin Southern Europe, such as Mount Hymettus and other localities in\r\nGreece, the hills above Bologna and Genoa, and a few waste places in\r\nSpain; but the further west we go the more we find mentioned such\r\nlocalities as fields, cultivated ground, etc.; and careful authors do\r\nnot fail to note that the species has probably escaped from\r\ncultivation.[539] I do not hesitate to say that if a plant of this\r\nnature were indigenous in Southern Europe, it would be far more common,\r\nand would not be wanting to the insular floras, such as those of Sicily,\r\nIschia, and the Balearic Isles.[540]\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of the species and of its use in India is confirmed by the\r\nexistence of several different names in different dialects, and above\r\nall of a Sanskrit and modern Hindu name, _methi_.[541] There is a\r\nPersian name, _schemlit_, and an Arab name, _helbeh_;[542] but none is\r\nknown in Hebrew.[543] One of the names of the plant in ancient Greek,\r\n_tailis_ τηλις, may, perhaps, be considered by philologists as akin to\r\nthe Sanskrit name,[544] but of this I am no judge. The species may have\r\nbeen introduced by the Aryans, and the primitive name have left no trace\r\nin northern languages, since it can only live in the south of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Bird’s Foot+—_Ornithopus sativus_, Brotero; _O. isthmocarpus_, Cosson.\r\n\r\nThe true bird’s foot, wild and cultivated in Portugal, was described for\r\nthe first time in 1804 by Brotero,[545] and Cosson has distinguished it\r\nmore clearly from allied species.[546] Some authors had confounded it\r\nwith _Ornithopus roseus_ of Dufour, and agriculturists have sometimes\r\ngiven it the name of a very different species, _O. perpusillus_, which\r\nby reason of its small size is unsuited for cultivation. It is only\r\nnecessary to see the pod of _Ornithopus sativus_ to make certain of the\r\nspecies, for it is when ripe contracted at intervals and considerably\r\nbent. If there are in the fields plants of a similar appearance, but\r\nwhose pods are straight and not contracted, they are the result of a\r\ncross with _O. roseus_, or, if the pod is curved but not contracted,\r\nwith _O. compressus_. From the appearance of these plants, it seems that\r\nthey might be grown in the same manner, and would present, I suppose,\r\nthe same advantages.\r\n\r\nThe bird’s foot is only suited to a dry and sandy soil. It is an annual\r\nwhich furnishes in Portugal a very early spring fodder. Its cultivation\r\nhas been successfully introduced into Campine.[547]\r\n\r\n_O. sativus_ appears to be wild in several districts of Portugal and the\r\nsouth of Spain. I have a specimen from Tangier; and Cosson found it in\r\nAlgeria. It is often found in abandoned fields, and even elsewhere. It\r\nis difficult to say whether the specimens are not from plants escaped\r\nfrom cultivation, but localities are cited where this seems improbable;\r\nfor instance, a pine wood near Chiclana, in the south of Spain\r\n(Willkomm).\r\n\r\n\r\n+Spergula+, or +Corn Spurry+—_Spergula arvensis_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis annual, belonging to the family of the Caryophylaceæ, grows in\r\nsandy fields and similar places in Europe, in North Africa and\r\nAbyssinia,[548] in Western Asia as far as Hindustan,[549] and even in\r\nJava.[550] It is difficult to know over what extent of the old world it\r\nwas originally indigenous. In many localities we do not know if it is\r\nreally wild or naturalized from cultivation. Sometimes a recent\r\nintroduction may be suspected. In India, for instance, numerous\r\nspecimens have been gathered in the last few years; but Roxburgh, who\r\nwas so diligent a collector at the end of the last and the beginning of\r\nthe present century, does not mention the species. No Sanskrit or modern\r\nHindu name is known,[551] and it has not been found in the countries\r\nbetween India and Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe common names may tell us something with regard to the origin of the\r\nspecies and to its cultivation.\r\n\r\nNo Greek or Latin name is known. _Spergula_, in Italian _spergola_,\r\nseems to be a common name long in use in Italy. Another Italian name,\r\n_erba renaiola_, indicates only its growth in the sand (_rena_). The\r\nFrench (_spargoule_), Spanish (_esparcillas_), Portuguese (_espargata_),\r\nand German (_Spark_), have all the same root. It seems that throughout\r\nthe south of Europe the species was taken from country to country by the\r\nRomans, before the division of the Latin languages. In the north the\r\ncase is very different. There is a Russian name, _toritsa_;[552] several\r\nDanish names, _humb_ or _hum_, _girr_ or _kirr_;[553] and Swedish,\r\n_knutt_, _fryle_, _nägde_, _skorff_.[554] This great diversity shows\r\nthat attention had long been drawn to this plant in this part of Europe,\r\nand argues an ancient cultivation. It was cultivated in the\r\nneighbourhood of Montbelliard in the sixteenth century,[555] and it is\r\nnot stated that it was then of recent introduction. Probably it arose in\r\nthe south of Europe during the Roman occupation, and perhaps earlier in\r\nthe north. In any case, its original home must have been Europe.\r\n\r\nAgriculturists distinguish a taller variety of spergula,[556] but\r\nbotanists are not agreed with them in finding in it sufficient\r\ncharacteristics of a distinct species, and some do not even make it a\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Guinea Grass+—_Panicum maximum_, Jacquin.[557]\r\n\r\nThis perennial grass has a great reputation in countries lying between\r\nthe tropics as a nutritious fodder, easy of cultivation. With a little\r\ncare a meadow of guinea grass will last for twenty years.[558]\r\n\r\nIts cultivation appears to have begun in the West Indies. P. Browne\r\nspeaks of it in his work on Jamaica, published in the middle of the last\r\ncentury, and it is subsequently mentioned by Swartz.\r\n\r\nThe former mentions the name guinea grass, without any remarks on the\r\noriginal home of the species. The latter says, “formerly brought from\r\nthe coast of Africa to the Antilles.” He probably trusted to the\r\nindication given by the common name; but we know how fallacious such\r\nindications of origin sometimes are. Witness the so-called Turkey wheat,\r\nwhich comes from America.\r\n\r\nSwartz, who is an excellent botanist, says that the plant grows in the\r\ndry cultivated pastures of the West Indies, where it is also wild, which\r\nmay imply that it has become naturalized in places where it was formerly\r\ncultivated. I cannot find it anywhere asserted that it is really wild in\r\nthe West Indies. It is otherwise in Brazil. From data collected by de\r\nMartius and studied by Nees,[559] data afterwards increased and more\r\ncarefully studied by Dœll,[560] _Panicum maximum_ grows in the clearings\r\nof the forests of the Amazon valley, near Santarem, in the provinces of\r\nBalria, Ceara, Rio de Janeiro, and Saint Paul. Although the plant is\r\noften cultivated in these countries, the localities given, by their\r\nnumber and nature, prove that it is indigenous. Dœll has also seen\r\nspecimens from French Guiana and New Granada.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Africa, Sir William Hooker[561] mentioned specimens\r\nbrought from Sierra Leone, from Aguapim, from the banks of the Quorra,\r\nand from the Island of St. Thomas, in Western Africa. Nees[562]\r\nindicates the species in several districts of Cape Colony, even in the\r\nbush and in mountainous country. Richard[563] mentions places in\r\nAbyssinia, which also seem to be beyond the limits of cultivation, but\r\nhe owns to being not very sure of the species. Anderson, on the\r\ncontrary, positively asserts that _Panicum maximum_ was brought from the\r\nbanks of the Mozambique and of the Zambesi rivers by the traveller\r\nPeters.[564]\r\n\r\nThe species is known to have been introduced into Mauritius by the\r\nGovernour Labourdonnais,[565] and to have become naturalized from\r\ncultivation as in Rodriguez and the Seychelles Isles. Its introduction\r\ninto Asia must be recent, for Roxburgh and Miquel do not mention the\r\nspecies. In Ceylon it is only cultivated.[566]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it seems to me that the probabilities are in favour of an\r\nAfrican origin, as its name indicates, and this is confirmed by the\r\ngeneral, but insufficiently grounded opinion of authors.[567] However,\r\nas the plant spreads so rapidly, it is strange that it has not reached\r\nEgypt from the Mozambique or Abyssinia, and that it was introduced so\r\nlate into the islands to the east of Africa. If the co-existence of\r\nphanerogamous species in Africa and America previous to cultivation were\r\nnot extremely rare, it might be inferred in this case; but this is\r\nunlikely in the case of a cultivated plant of which the diffusion is\r\nevidently very easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Article III._—+Various Uses of the Stem and Leaves.+\r\n\r\n\r\n+Tea+—_Thea sinensis_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the eighteenth century, when the shrub which produces\r\ntea was still very little known, Linnæus gave it the name of _Thea\r\nsinensis_. Soon afterwards, in the second edition of the _Species\r\nPlantarum_, he judged it better to distinguish two species, _Thea bohea_\r\nand _Thea viridis_, which he believed to correspond to the commercial\r\ndistinction between black and green teas. It has since been proved that\r\nthere is but one species, comprehending several varieties, from all of\r\nwhich either black or green tea may be obtained according to the process\r\nof manufacture. This question was settled, when another was raised, as\r\nto whether _Thea_ really forms a genus by itself distinct from the genus\r\n_Camellia_. Some authors make _Thea_ a section of the old genus\r\n_Camellia_; but from the characters indicated with great precision by\r\nSeemann,[568] it seems to me that we are justified in retaining the\r\ngenus _Thea_, together with the old nomenclature of the principal\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nA Japanese legend, related by Kæmpfer,[569] is often quoted. A priest\r\nwho came from India into China in A.D. 519, having succumbed to sleep\r\nwhen he had wished to watch and pray, in a movement of anger cut off his\r\ntwo eyelids, which were changed into a shrub, the tea tree, whose\r\nleaves are eminently calculated to prevent sleep. Unfortunately for\r\nthose people who readily admit legends in whole or in part, the Chinese\r\nhave never heard of this story, although the event is said to have taken\r\nplace in their country. Tea was known to them long before 519, and\r\nprobably it was not brought from India. This is what Bretschneider tells\r\nus in his little work, rich in botanical and philological facts.[570]\r\nThe _Pent-sao_, he says, mentions tea 2700 B.C., the _Rye_ 300 or 600\r\nB.C.; and the commentator of the latter work, in the fourth century of\r\nour era, gave details about the plant and about the infusion of the\r\nleaves. Its use is, therefore, of very ancient date in China. It is\r\nperhaps more recent in Japan, and if it has been long known in\r\nCochin-China, it is possible, but not proved, that it formerly spread\r\nthither from India; authors cite no Sanskrit name, nor even any name in\r\nmodern Indian languages. This fact will appear strange when contrasted\r\nwith what we have to say on the natural habitat of the species.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the tea-plant often sow themselves beyond the limits of\r\ncultivation, thereby inspiring doubt among botanists as to the wild\r\nnature of plants encountered here and there. Thunberg believed the\r\nspecies to be wild in Japan, but Franchet and Savatier[571] absolutely\r\ndeny this. Fortune,[572] who has so carefully examined the cultivation\r\nof tea in China, does not speak of the wild plant. Fontanier[573] says\r\nthat the tea-plant grows wild abundantly in Mantschuria. It is probable\r\nthat it exists in the mountainous districts of South-eastern China,\r\nwhere naturalists have not yet penetrated. Loureiro says that it is\r\nfound both “cultivated and uncultivated” in Cochin-China.[574] What is\r\nmore certain is, that English travellers gathered specimens in Upper\r\nAssam[575] and in the province of Cachar.[576] So that the tea-plant\r\nmust be wild in the mountainous region which separates the plains of\r\nIndia from those of China, but the use of the leaves was not formerly\r\nknown in India.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of tea, now introduced into several colonies, has\r\nproduced admirable results in Assam. Not only is the product of a\r\nsuperior quality to that of average Chinese teas, but the quantity\r\nobtained increases rapidly. In 1870, three million pounds of tea were\r\nproduced in British India; in 1878, thirty-seven million pounds; and in\r\n1880, a harvest of seventy million pounds was looked for.[577] Tea will\r\nnot bear frost, and suffers from drought. As I have elsewhere\r\nstated,[578] the conditions which favour it are the opposite to those\r\nwhich suit the vine. On the other hand, it has been observed that tea\r\nflourishes in Azores, where good wine is made;[579] but it is possible\r\nto cultivate in gardens, or on a small scale, many plants which will not\r\nbe profitable on a large scale. The vine grows in China, yet the\r\nmanufacture of wine is unimportant. Conversely, no wine-growing country\r\ngrows tea for exportation. After China, Japan, and Assam, it is in Java,\r\nCeylon, and Brazil that tea is most largely grown, where, certainly, the\r\nvine is little cultivated, or not at all; while the wines of dry\r\nregions, such as Australia and the Cape, are already known in the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Flax+—_Linum usitatissimum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the origin of flax, or rather of the cultivated flax,\r\nis one of those which give rise to most interesting researches.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the difficulties which it presents, we must first\r\nascertain what nearly allied forms authors designate—sometimes as\r\ndistinct species of the genus _Linum_, and sometimes as varieties of a\r\nsingle species.\r\n\r\nThe first important work on this subject was by Planchon, in 1848.[580]\r\nHe clearly showed the differences between _Linum usitatissimum_, _L.\r\nhumile_, and _L. angustifolium_, which were little known. Afterwards\r\nHeer,[581] when making profound researches into ancient cultivation,\r\nwent again into the characters indicated, and by adding the study of two\r\nintermediate forms, as well as the comparison of a great number of\r\nspecimens, he arrived at the conclusion that there was a single species,\r\ncomposed of several slightly different forms. I give a translation of\r\nhis Latin summary of the characters, only adding a name for each\r\ndistinct form, in accordance with the custom of botanical works.\r\n\r\n_Linum usitatissimum._\r\n\r\n1. _Annuum_ (annual). Root annual; stem single, upright; capsules 7 to 8\r\nmm. long; seeds 4 to 6 mm., terminating in a point. α _Vulgare_\r\n(common). Capsules 7 mm., not opening when ripe, and displaying glabrous\r\npartitions. German names, _Schliesslein_, _Dreschlein_. β. _Humile_\r\n(low). Capsules 8 mm., opening suddenly when ripe; the partitions hairy.\r\n_Linum humile_, Miller; _L. crepitans_, Böninghausen. German names,\r\n_Klanglein_, _Springlein_.\r\n\r\n2. _Hyemale_ (winter). Root annual or biennial; stems numerous,\r\nspreading at the base, and bent; capsules 7 mm., terminating in a point.\r\n_Linum hyemale romanum._ In German, _Winterlein_.\r\n\r\n3. _Ambiguum_ (doubtful). Root annual or perennial; stems numerous,\r\nleaves acuminate; capsules 7 mm., with partitions nearly free from\r\nhairs; seeds 4 mm., ending in a short point. _Linum ambiguum_, Jordan.\r\n\r\n4. _Angustifolium_ (narrow-leaved). Root annual or perennial; stems\r\nnumerous, spreading at the base, and bent; capsules 6 mm., with hairy\r\npartitions; seeds 3 mm., slightly hooked at the top. _Linum\r\nangustifolium._\r\n\r\nIt may be seen how easily one form passes into another. The quality of\r\nannual, biennial, or perennial, which Heer suspected to be uncertain, is\r\nvague, especially for the _angustifolium_; for Loret, who has observed\r\nthis flax in the neighbourhood of Montpellier, says,[582] “In very hot\r\ncountries it is nearly always an annual, and this is the case in Sicily\r\naccording to Gussone; with us it is annual, biennial, or perennial,\r\naccording to the nature of the soil in which it grows; and this may be\r\nascertained by observing it on the shore, notably at Maguelone. There it\r\nmay be seen that along the borders of trodden paths it lasts longer than\r\non the sand, where the sun soon dries up the roots and the acidity of\r\nthe soil prevents the plant from enduring more than a year.”\r\n\r\nWhen forms and physiological conditions pass from one into another, and\r\nare distinguished by characters which vary according to circumstances,\r\nwe are led to consider the individuals as constituting a single species,\r\nalthough these forms and conditions possess a certain degree of\r\nheredity, and date perhaps from very early times. We are, however,\r\nforced to consider them separately in our researches into their origin.\r\nI shall first indicate in what country each variety has been discovered\r\nin a wild or half-wild state. I shall then speak of cultivation, and we\r\nshall see how far geographical and historical facts confirm the opinion\r\nof the unity of species.\r\n\r\nThe _common annual flax_ has not yet been discovered, with absolute\r\ncertainty, in a wild state. I possess several specimens of it from\r\nIndia, and Planchon saw others in the herbarium at Kew; but Anglo-Indian\r\nbotanists do not admit that the plant is indigenous in British India.\r\nThe recent flora of Sir Joseph Hooker speaks of it as a species\r\ncultivated principally for the oil extracted from the seeds; and Mr. C.\r\nB. Clarke, formerly director of the botanical gardens in Calcutta,\r\nwrites to me that the specimens must have been cultivated, its\r\ncultivation being very common in winter in the north of India.\r\nBoissier[583] mentions _L. humile_, with narrow leaves, which Kotschy\r\ngathered “near Schiraz in Persia, at the foot of the mountain called\r\nSabst Buchom.” This is, perhaps, a spot far removed from cultivation;\r\nbut I cannot give satisfactory information on this head. Hohenacker\r\nfound _L. usitatissimum_ “half wild” in the province of _Talysch_, to\r\nthe south of the Caucasus, towards the Caspian Sea.[584] Steven is more\r\npositive with regard to Southern Russia.[585] According to him, it “is\r\nfound pretty often on the barren hills to the south of the Crimea,\r\nbetween Jalta and Nikita; and Nordmann found it on the eastern coast of\r\nthe Black Sea.” Advancing westward in Southern Russia, or in the region\r\nof the Mediterranean, the species is but rarely mentioned, and only as\r\nescaped from cultivation, or half wild. In spite of doubts and of the\r\nscanty data which we possess, I think it very possible that the annual\r\nflax, in one or other of these two forms, may be wild in the district\r\nbetween the south of Persia and the Crimea, at least in a few\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nThe _winter flax_ is only known under cultivation in a few provinces of\r\nItaly.[586]\r\n\r\nThe _Linum ambiguum_ of Jordan grows on the coast of Provence and of\r\nLanguedoc in dry places.[587]\r\n\r\nLastly, _Linum angustifolium_, which hardly differs from the preceding,\r\nhas a well-defined and rather large area. It grows wild, especially on\r\nhills throughout the region of which the Mediterranean forms the centre;\r\nthat is, in the Canaries and Madeira, in Marocco,[588] Algeria,[589] and\r\nas far as the Cyrenaic;[590] from the south of Europe, as far as\r\nEngland,[591] the Alps, and the Balkan Mountains; and lastly, in Asia\r\nfrom the south of the Caucasus[592] to Lebanon and Palestine.[593] I do\r\nnot find it mentioned in the Crimea, nor beyond the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the cultivation of flax, destined in most instances\r\nto furnish a textile substance, often also to yield oil, and cultivated\r\namong certain peoples for the nutritious properties of the seed. I first\r\nstudied the question of its origin in 1855,[594] and with the following\r\nresult:—\r\n\r\nIt was abundantly shown that the ancient Egyptians and the Hebrews made\r\nuse of linen stuffs. Herodotus affirms this. Moreover, the plant may be\r\nseen figured in the ancient Egyptian drawings, and the microscope\r\nindubitably shows that the bandages which bind the mummies are of\r\nlinen.[595] The culture of flax is of ancient date in Europe; it was\r\nknown to the Kelts, and in India according to history. Lastly, the\r\nwidely different common names indicate likewise an ancient cultivation\r\nor long use in different countries. The Keltic name _lin_, and\r\nGreco-Latin _linon_ or _linum_, has no analogy with the Hebrew\r\n_pischta_,[596] nor with the Sanskrit names _ooma_, _atasi_,\r\n_utasi_.[597] A few botanists mention the flax as “nearly wild” in the\r\nsouth-east of Russia, to the south of the Caucasus and to the east of\r\nSiberia, but it was not known to be truly wild. I then summed up the\r\nprobabilities, saying, “The varying etymology of the names, the\r\nantiquity of cultivation in Egypt, in Europe, and in the north of India,\r\nthe circumstance that in the latter district flax is cultivated for the\r\nyield of oil alone, lead me to believe that two or three species of\r\ndifferent origin, confounded by most authors under the name of _Linum\r\nusitatissimum_, were formerly cultivated in different countries, without\r\nimitation or communication the one with the other.... I am very doubtful\r\nwhether the species cultivated by the ancient Egyptians was the species\r\nindigenous in Russia and in Siberia.”\r\n\r\nMy conjectures were confirmed ten years later by a very curious\r\ndiscovery made by Oswald Heer. The lake-dwellers of Eastern Switzerland,\r\nat a time when they only used stone implements, and did not know the use\r\nof hemp, cultivated and wove a flax which is not our common annual\r\nflax, but the perennial flax called _Linum angustifolium_, which is wild\r\nsouth of the Alps. This is shown by the examination of the capsules,\r\nseeds, and especially of the lower part of a plant carefully extracted\r\nfrom the sediment at Robenhausen.[598] The illustration published by\r\nHeer shows distinctly a root surmounted by from two to four stems after\r\nthe manner of perennial plants. The stems had been cut, whereas our\r\ncommon flax is plucked up by the roots, another proof of the persistent\r\nnature of the plant. With the remains of the Robenhausen flax some\r\ngrains of _Silene cretica_ were found, a species which is also foreign\r\nto Switzerland, and abundant in Italy in the fields of flax.[599] Hence\r\nHeer concluded that the Swiss lake-dwellers imported the seeds of the\r\nItalian flax. This was apparently the case, unless we suppose that the\r\nclimate of Switzerland at that time differed from that of our own epoch,\r\nfor the perennial flax would not at the present day survive the winters\r\nof Eastern Switzerland.[600] Heer’s opinion is supported by the\r\nsurprising fact that flax has not been found among the remains of the\r\nlake-dwellings of Laybach and Mondsee of the Austrian States, where\r\nbronze has been discovered.[601] The late epoch of the introduction of\r\nflax into this region excludes the hypothesis that the inhabitants of\r\nSwitzerland received it from Eastern Europe, from which, moreover, they\r\nwere separated by immense forests.\r\n\r\nSince the ingenious observations of the Zürich _savant_, a flax has been\r\ndiscovered which was employed by the prehistoric inhabitants of the\r\npeat-mosses of Lagozza, in Lombardy; and Sordelli has shown that it was\r\nthe same as that of Robenhausen, _L. angustifolium_.[602] This ancient\r\npeople was ignorant of the use of hemp and of metals, but they possessed\r\nthe same cereals as the Swiss lake-dwellers of the stone age, and ate\r\nlike them the acorns of _Quercus robur_, var. _sessiliflora_. There was,\r\ntherefore, a civilization which had reached a certain development on\r\nboth sides of the Alps, before metals, even bronze, were in common use,\r\nand before hemp and the domestic fowl were known.[603] It was probably\r\nbefore the arrival of the Aryans in Europe, or soon after that\r\nevent.[604]\r\n\r\nThe common names of the flax in ancient European languages may throw\r\nsome light on this question.\r\n\r\nThe name _lin_, _llin_, _linu_, _linon_, _linum_, _lein_, _lan_, exists\r\nin all the European languages of Aryan origin of the centre and south of\r\nEurope, Keltic, Slavonic, Greek, or Latin. This name is, however, not\r\ncommon to the Aryan languages of India; consequently, as Pictet[605]\r\njustly says, the cultivation must have been begun by the western Aryans,\r\nand before their arrival in Europe. Another idea occurred to me which\r\nled me into further researches, but they were unproductive. I thought\r\nthat, since this flax was cultivated by the lake-dwellers of Switzerland\r\nand Italy before the arrival of the Aryan peoples, it was probably also\r\ngrown by the Iberians, who then occupied Spain and Gaul; and perhaps\r\nsome special name for it has remained among the Basques, the supposed\r\ndescendants of the Iberians. Now, according to several dictionaries of\r\ntheir language,[606] _liho_, _lino_, or _li_, according to the dialects,\r\nsignifies flax, which agrees with the name diffused throughout Southern\r\nEurope. The Basques seem, therefore, to have received flax from peoples\r\nof Aryan origin, or perhaps they have lost the ancient name and\r\nsubstituted that of the Kelts and Romans. The name _flachs_ or _flax_ of\r\nthe Teutonic languages comes from the Old German _flahs_. There are also\r\nspecial names in the north-west of Europe—_pellawa_, _aiwina_, in\r\nFinnish;[607] _hor_, _härr_, _hor_, in Danish;[608] _hor_ and _tone_ in\r\nancient Gothic.[609] _Haar_ exists in the German of Salzburg.[610] This\r\nword may be in the ordinary sense of the German for thread or hair, as\r\nthe name _li_ may be connected with the same root as _ligare_, to bind,\r\nand as _hör_, in the plural _hörvar_, is connected by philologists[611]\r\nwith _harva_, the German root for _Flachs_; but it is, nevertheless, a\r\nfact that in Scandinavian countries and in Finland terms have been used\r\nwhich differ from those employed throughout the south of Europe. This\r\nvariety shows the antiquity of the cultivation, and agrees with the fact\r\nthat the lake-dwellers of Switzerland and Italy cultivated a species of\r\nflax before the first invasion of the Aryans. It is possible, I might\r\neven say probable, that the latter imported the name _li_ rather than\r\nthe plant or its cultivation; but as there is no wild flax in the north\r\nof Europe, an ancient people, the Finns, of Turanian origin, introduced\r\nthe flax into the north before the Aryans. In this case they must have\r\ncultivated the annual flax, for the perennial variety will not bear the\r\nseverity of the northern winters; while we know how favourable the\r\nclimate of Riga is in summer to the cultivation of the annual flax. Its\r\nfirst introduction into Gaul, Switzerland, and Italy may have been from\r\nthe south, by the Iberians, and in Finland by the Finns; and the Aryans\r\nmay have afterwards diffused those names which were commonest among\r\nthemselves—that of _linum_ in the south, and of _flahs_ in the north.\r\nPerhaps the Aryans and Finns had brought the annual flax from Asia,\r\nwhich would soon have been substituted for the perennial variety, which\r\nis less productive and less adapted to cold countries. It is not known\r\nprecisely at what epoch the cultivation of the annual flax in Italy took\r\nthe place of that of the perennial _linum angustifolium_, but it must\r\nhave been before the Christian era; for Latin authors speak of a\r\nwell-established cultivation, and Pliny says that the flax was sown in\r\nspring and rooted up in the summer.[612] Metal implements were not then\r\nwanting, and therefore the flax would have been cut if it had been\r\nperennial. Moreover, the latter, if sown in spring, would not have\r\nripened till autumn.\r\n\r\nFor the same reasons the flax cultivated by the ancient Egyptians must\r\nhave been an annual. Hitherto neither entire plants nor a great number\r\nof capsules have been found in the catacombs of a nature to furnish\r\ndirect and incontestable proof. Unger[613] alone was able to examine a\r\ncapsule taken from the bricks of a monument, which Leipsius attributes\r\nto the thirteenth or fourteenth century before Christ, and he found it\r\nmore like those of _L. usitatissimum_ than of _L. angustifolium_. Out of\r\nthree seeds which Braun[614] saw in the Berlin Museum, mixed with those\r\nof other cultivated plants, one appeared to him to belong to _L.\r\nangustifolium_, and the other to _L. humile_; but it must be owned that\r\na single seed without plant or capsule is not sufficient proof. Ancient\r\nEgyptian paintings show that flax was not reaped with a sickle like\r\ncereals, but uprooted.[615] In Egypt flax is cultivated in the winter,\r\nfor the summer drought would no more allow of a perennial variety, than\r\nthe cold of northern countries, where it is sown in spring, to be\r\ngathered in summer. It may be added that the annual flax of the variety\r\ncalled _humile_ is the only one now grown in Abyssinia, and also the\r\nonly one that modern collectors have seen in Egypt.[616]\r\n\r\nHeer suggests that the ancient Egyptians may have cultivated _L.\r\nangustifolium_ of the Mediterranean region, sowing it as an annual\r\nplant.[617] I am more inclined to believe that they had previously\r\nimported or received their flax from Egypt, already in the form of the\r\nspecies _L. humile_. Their modes of cultivation, and the figures on the\r\nmonuments, show that their knowledge of the plant dated from a remote\r\nantiquity. Now it is known that the Egyptians of the first dynasties\r\nbefore Cheops belonged to a proto-semitic race, which came into Egypt by\r\nthe isthmus of Suez.[618] Flax has been found in a tomb of ancient\r\nChaldea prior to the existence of Babylon,[619] and its use in this\r\nregion is lost in the remotest antiquity. Thus the first Egyptians of\r\nwhite race may have imported the cultivated flax, or their immediate\r\nsuccessors may have received it from Asia before the epoch of the\r\nPhœnician colonies in Greece, and before direct communication was\r\nestablished between Greece and Egypt under the fourteenth dynasty.[620]\r\n\r\nA very early introduction of the plant into Egypt from Asia does not\r\nprevent us from admitting that it was at different times taken from the\r\nEast to the West at a later epoch than that of the first Egyptian\r\ndynasties. Thus the western Aryans and the Phœnicians may have\r\nintroduced into Europe a flax more advantageous than _L. angustifolium_\r\nduring the period from 2500 to 1200 years before our era.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the plant by the Aryans must have extended further\r\nnorth than that by the Phœnicians. In Greece, at the time of the Trojan\r\nwar, fine linen stuffs were still imported from Colchis; that is to say,\r\nfrom that region at the foot of the Caucasus where the common annual\r\nflax has been found wild in modern times. It does not appear that the\r\nGreeks cultivated the plant at that epoch.[621] The Aryans had perhaps\r\nalready introduced its cultivation into the valley of the Danube.\r\nHowever, I noticed just now that the lacustrine remains of Mondsee and\r\nLaybach show no trace of any flax. In the last centuries before the\r\nChristian era the Romans procured very fine linen from Spain, although\r\nthe names of the plant in that country do not tend to show that the\r\nPhœnicians introduced it. There is not any Oriental name existing in\r\nEurope belonging either to antiquity or to the Middle Ages. The Arabic\r\nname _kattan_, _kettane_, or _kittane_, of Persian origin,[622] has\r\nspread westward only among the Kabyles of Algeria.[623]\r\n\r\nThe sum of facts and probabilities appear to me to lead to the following\r\nstatements, which may be accepted until they are modified by further\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\n1. _Linum angustifolium_, usually perennial, rarely biennial or annual,\r\nwhich is found wild from the Canary Isles to Palestine and the Caucasus,\r\nwas cultivated in Switzerland and the north of Italy by peoples more\r\nancient than the conquerors of Aryan race. Its cultivation was replaced\r\nby that of the annual flax.\r\n\r\n2. The annual flax (_L. usitatissimum_), cultivated for at least four\r\nthousand or five thousand years in Mesopotamia, Assyria, and Egypt, was\r\nand still is wild in the districts included between the Persian Gulf,\r\nthe Caspian Sea, and the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n3. This annual flax appears to have been introduced into the north of\r\nEurope by the Finns (of Turanian race), afterwards into the rest of\r\nEurope by the western Aryans, and perhaps here and there by the\r\nPhœnicians; lastly into Hindustan by the eastern Aryans, after their\r\nseparation from the European Aryans.\r\n\r\n4. These two principal forms or conditions of flax exist in cultivation,\r\nand have probably been wild in their modern areas for the last five\r\nthousand years at least. It is not possible to guess at their previous\r\ncondition. Their transitions and varieties are so numerous that they may\r\nbe considered as one species comprising two or three hereditary\r\nvarieties, which are each again divided into sub-varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Jute+—_Corchorus capsularis_ and _Corchorus olitorius_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe fibres of the jute, imported in great quantities in the last few\r\nyears, especially into England, are taken from the stem of these two\r\nspecies of Corchorus, annuals of the family of the Tiliaceæ. The leaves\r\nare also used as a vegetable.\r\n\r\n_C. capsularis_ has a nearly spherical fruit, flattened at the top, and\r\nsurrounded by longitudinal ridges. There is a good coloured illustration\r\nof it in the work of the younger Jacquin, _Eclogæ_, pl. 119. _C.\r\nolitorius_, on the contrary, has a long fruit, like the pod of a\r\nCrucifer. It is figured in the _Botanical Magazine_, fig. 2810, and in\r\nLamarck, fig. 478.\r\n\r\nThe species of the genus are distributed nearly equally in the warm\r\nregions of Asia, Africa, and America; consequently the origin of each\r\ncannot be guessed. It must be sought in floras and herbaria, with the\r\nhelp of historical and other data.\r\n\r\n_Corchorus capsularis_ is commonly cultivated in the Sunda Islands, in\r\nCeylon, in the peninsula of Hindustan, in Bengal, in Southern China, in\r\nthe Philippine Islands,[624] generally in Southern Asia. Forster does\r\nnot mention it in his work on the plants in use among the inhabitants of\r\nthe Pacific, whence it may be inferred that at the time of Cook’s\r\nvoyages, a century ago, its cultivation had not spread in that\r\ndirection. It may even be suspected from this fact that it does not date\r\nfrom a very remote epoch in the isles of the Indian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nBlume says that _Corchorus capsularis_ grows in the marshes of Java near\r\nParang,[625] and I have two specimens from Java which are not given as\r\ncultivated.[626] Thwaites mentions it as “very common” in Ceylon.[627]\r\n\r\nOn the continent of Asia, authors speak more of it as a plant cultivated\r\nin Bengal and China. Wight, who gives a good illustration of the plant,\r\ndoes not mention its native place. Edgeworth,[628] who has studied on\r\nthe spot the flora of the district of Banda, says that it is found in\r\n“the fields.” In the _Flora of British India_, Masters, who drew up the\r\narticle on the Tiliaceæ from the herbarium at Kew, says “in the hottest\r\nregions of India, cultivated in most tropical countries.”[629] I have a\r\nspecimen from Bengal which is not given as cultivated. Loureiro says\r\n“wild, and cultivated in the province of Canton in China,”[630] which\r\nprobably means wild in Cochin-China, and cultivated in Canton. In Japan\r\nthe plant grows in cultivated soil.[631] In conclusion, I am not\r\nconvinced that the species exists in a truly wild state north of\r\nCalcutta, although it may perhaps have spread from cultivation and have\r\nsown itself here and there.\r\n\r\n_C. capsularis_ has been introduced into various parts of tropical\r\nAfrica and even of America, but it is only cultivated on a large scale\r\nfor the production of jute thread in Southern Asia, and especially in\r\nBengal.\r\n\r\n_C. olitorius_ is more used as a vegetable than for its fibres. Out of\r\nAsia it is employed exclusively for the leaves. It is one of the\r\ncommonest of culinary plants among the modern Egyptians and Syrians, who\r\ncall it in Arabic _melokych_, but it is not likely that they had any\r\nknowledge of it in ancient times, as we know of no Hebrew name.[632] The\r\npresent inhabitants of Crete cultivate it under the name of\r\n_mouchlia_,[633] evidently derived from the Arabic, and the ancient\r\nGreeks were not acquainted with it.\r\n\r\nAccording to several authors[634] this species of Corchorus is wild in\r\nseveral provinces of British India. Thwaites says it is common in the\r\nhot districts of Ceylon; but in Java, Blume only mentions it as growing\r\namong rubbish (_in ruderatis_). I cannot find it mentioned in\r\nCochin-China or Japan. Boissier saw specimens from Mesopotamia,\r\nAfghanistan, Syria, and Anatolia, but gives as a general indication,\r\n“culta, et in ruderatis subspontanea.” No Sanskrit name for the two\r\ncultivated species of Corchorus is known.[635]\r\n\r\nTouching the indigenous character of the plant in Africa, Masters, in\r\nOliver’s _Flora of Tropical Africa_ (i. p. 262), says, “wild, or\r\ncultivated as a vegetable throughout tropical Africa.” He attributes to\r\nthe same species two plants from Guinea which G. Don had described as\r\ndifferent, and as to whose wild nature he probably knew nothing. I have\r\na specimen from Kordofan gathered by Kotschy, No. 45, “on the borders of\r\nthe fields of sorghum.” Peters, as far as I know, is the only author who\r\nasserts that the plant is wild. He found _C. olitorius_ “in dry places,\r\nand also in the meadows in the neighbourhood of Sena and Tette.”\r\nSchweinfurth only gives it as a cultivated plant in the whole Nile\r\nValley.[636] This is also the case in the flora of Senegambia by\r\nGuillemin, Perrottet, and Richard.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, _C. olitorius_ seems to be wild in the moderately warm\r\nregions of Western India, of Kordofan, and probably of some intermediate\r\ncountries. It must have spread from the coast of Timor, and as far as\r\nNorthern Australia, into Africa and towards Anatolia, in the wake of a\r\ncultivation not perhaps of earlier date than the Christian era, even at\r\nits origin.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the assertions made in various works, the cultivation of\r\nthis plant is rarely indicated in America. I note, however, on\r\nGrisebach’s authority,[637] that it has become naturalized in Jamaica\r\nfrom gardens, as often happens in the case of cultivated annuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Sumach.+—_Rhus coriaria._\r\n\r\nThis tree is cultivated in Spain and Italy[638] for the young shoots and\r\nleaves, which are dried and made into a powder for tanning. I recently\r\nsaw a plantation in Sicily, of which the product was exported to\r\nAmerica. As oak-bark becomes more rare and substances for tanning are\r\nmore in demand, it is probable that this cultivation will spread; all\r\nthe more that it is suitable to sandy, sterile regions. In Algeria,\r\nAustralia, at the Cape, and in the Argentine Republic, it might be\r\nintroduced with advantage.[639] Ancient peoples used the slightly acid\r\nfruits as a seasoning, and the custom has lingered here and there; but I\r\nfind no proof that they cultivated the species.\r\n\r\nIt grows wild in the Canaries and in Madeira, in the Mediterranean\r\nregion and in the neighbourhood of the Black Sea, preferring dry and\r\nstony ground. In Asia its area extends as far as the south of the\r\nCaucasus, the Caspian Sea, and Persia.[640] The species is so common\r\nthat it may have been in use before it was cultivated.\r\n\r\nSumach is the Persian and Tartar name;[641] _rous_, _rhus_, the ancient\r\nname among the Greeks and Romans.[642] A proof of the persistence of\r\ncertain common names is found in the French “Currier’s _roux_ or\r\n_roure_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n+Khât+, or +Arab Tea+—_Catha edulis_, Forskal; _Celastrus edulis_, Vahl.\r\n\r\nThis shrub, belonging to the family of the _Celastraceæ_, is largely\r\ncultivated in Abyssinia, under the name of _tchut_ or _tchat_, and in\r\nArabia under that of _cat_ or _gat_. Its leaves are chewed, when green,\r\nlike those of the coca in America, and they have the same exciting and\r\nstrengthening properties. Those of uncultivated plants have a stronger\r\ntaste, and are even intoxicating. Botta saw that in Yemen as much\r\nimportance is attributed to the cultivation of the _Catha_ as to that of\r\ncoffee, and he mentions that a sheik, who is obliged to receive many\r\nvisits of ceremony, bought as much as a hundred francs’ worth of leaves\r\na day.[643] In Abyssinia an infusion is also made from the leaves.[644]\r\nIn spite of the eagerness with which stimulants are sought, this species\r\nhas not spread into the adjoining countries, such as Beluchistan,\r\nSouthern India, etc., where it might succeed.\r\n\r\nThe _Catha_ is wild in Abyssinia,[645] but has not yet been found wild\r\nin Arabia. It is true that the interior of the country is nearly unknown\r\nto botanists. It cannot be ascertained from Botta’s account whether the\r\nwild plants he mentions are wild and indigenous, or escaped from\r\ncultivation and more or less naturalized. Perhaps the _Catha_ was\r\nintroduced from Abyssinia with the coffee plant, which likewise has not\r\nbeen discovered wild in Arabia.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Maté+—_Ilex paraguariensis_, Saint-Hilaire.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Brazil and of Paraguay have employed from time\r\nimmemorial the leaves of this shrub, as the Chinese have those of the\r\ntea plant. They gather them especially in the damp forests of the\r\ninterior, between the degrees of 20 and 30 south latitude, and commerce\r\ntransports them dried to great distances throughout the greater part of\r\nSouth America. These leaves contain, with aroma and tannin, a principle\r\nanalogous to that of tea and coffee; they are not, however, much liked\r\nin the countries where Chinese tea is known. The plantations of maté are\r\nnot yet as important as the product of the wild shrub, but they may\r\nincrease as the population increases. Moreover, the preparation is\r\nsimpler than that of tea, as the leaves are not rolled.\r\n\r\nIllustrations and descriptions of the species, with a number of details\r\nabout its use and properties, may be found in the works of\r\nSaint-Hilaire, of Sir William Hooker, and of Martius.[646]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Coca.+—_Erythroxylon Coca_, Lamarck.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Peru and of the neighbouring provinces, at least in the\r\nhot moist regions, cultivate this shrub, of which they chew the leaves,\r\nas the natives of India chew the leaves of the betel. It is a very\r\nancient custom, which has spread even into elevated regions, where the\r\nspecies cannot live. Now that it is known how to extract the essential\r\npart of the coca, and its virtues are recognized as a tonic, which gives\r\nstrength to endure fatigue without having the drawbacks of alcoholic\r\nliquors, it is probable that an attempt will be made to extend its\r\ncultivation in America and elsewhere. In Guiana, for instance, the Malay\r\nArchipelago, or the valleys of Sikkim and Assam, or in Hindustan, since\r\nboth moisture and heat are requisite. Frost is very injurious to the\r\nspecies. The best sites are the slopes of hills where water cannot lie.\r\nAn attempt made in the neighbourhood of Lima failed, because of the\r\ninfrequency of rain and perhaps because of insufficient heat.[647]\r\n\r\nI shall not repeat here what may be found in several excellent treatises\r\non the coca;[648] I need only say that the original home of the species\r\nin America is not yet clearly ascertained. Gosse has shown that early\r\nauthors, such as Joseph de Jussieu, Lamarck, and Cavanilles, had only\r\nseen cultivated specimens. Mathews gathered it in Peru, in the ravine\r\n(_quebrada_) of Chinchao,[649] which appears to be a place beyond the\r\nlimits of cultivation. Some specimens from Cuchero, collected by\r\nPoeppig,[650] are said to be wild; but the traveller himself was not\r\nconvinced of their wild nature.[651] D’Orbigny thinks he saw the wild\r\ncoca on a hill in the eastern part of Bolivia.[652] Lastly, M. André has\r\nhad the courtesy to send me the specimens of _Erythroxylon_ in his\r\nherbarium, and I recognized the coca in several specimens from the\r\nvalley of the river Cauca in New Granada, with the note “in abundance,\r\nwild or half-wild.” Triana, however, does not admit that the species is\r\nwild in his country, New Granada.[653] Its extreme importance in Peru at\r\nthe time of the Incas, compared to the rarity of its use in New Granada,\r\nseems to show that it has escaped from cultivation in places where it\r\noccurs in the latter country, and that the species is indigenous only in\r\nthe east of Peru and Bolivia, according to the indications of the\r\ntravellers mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Dyer’s Indigo.+—_Indigofera tinctoria_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe Sanskrit name is _nili_.[654] The Latin name, _indicum_, shows that\r\nthe Romans knew that the indigo was a substance brought from India. As\r\nto the wild nature of the plant, Roxburgh says, “Native place unknown,\r\nfor, though it is now common in a wild state in most of the provinces of\r\nIndia, it is seldom found far from the districts where it is now\r\ncultivated, or has been cultivated formerly.” Wight and Royle, who have\r\npublished illustrations of the species, tell us nothing on this head,\r\nand more recent Indian floras mention the plant as cultivated.[655]\r\nSeveral other indigoes are wild in India.\r\n\r\nThis species has been found in the sands of Senegal,[656] but it is not\r\nmentioned in other African localities, and as it is often cultivated in\r\nSenegal, it seems probable that it is naturalized. The existence of a\r\nSanskrit name renders its Asiatic origin most probable.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Silver Indigo+—_Indigofera argentea._\r\n\r\nThis species is certainly wild in Abyssinia, Nubia, Kordofan, and\r\nSenaar.[657] It is cultivated in Egypt and Arabia. Hence we might\r\nsuppose that it was from this species that the ancient Egyptians\r\nextracted a blue dye;[658] but perhaps they imported their indigo from\r\nIndia, for its cultivation in Egypt is probably not of earlier date than\r\nthe Middle Ages.[659]\r\n\r\nA slightly different form, which Roxburgh gives as a separate species\r\n(_Indigofera cærulea_), and which appears rather to be a variety, is\r\nwild in the plains of the peninsula of Hindustan and of Beluchistan.\r\n\r\n\r\n+American Indigoes.+\r\n\r\nThere are probably one or two indigoes indigenous in America, but ill\r\ndefined, and often intermixed in cultivation with the species of the old\r\nworld, and naturalized beyond the limits of cultivation. This\r\ninterchange makes the matter too uncertain for me to venture upon any\r\nresearches into their original habitat. Some authors have thought that\r\n_I. Anil_, Linnæus, was one of these species. Linnæus, however, says\r\nthat his plant came from India (_Mantissa_, p. 273). The blue dye of the\r\nancient Mexicans was extracted from a plant which, according to\r\nHernandez’ account,[660] differs widely from the indigoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Henna+—_Lawsonia alba_, Lamarck (_Lawsonia inermis_ and _L. spinosa_ of\r\ndifferent authors).\r\n\r\nThe custom among Eastern women of staining their nails red with the\r\njuice of henna-leaves dates from a remote antiquity, as ancient Egyptian\r\npaintings and mummies show.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to know when and in what country this species was first\r\ncultivated to fulfil the requirements of a fashion as absurd as it is\r\npersistent, but it may be from a very early epoch, since the inhabitants\r\nof Babylon, Nineveh, and the towns of Egypt had gardens. It may be left\r\nto scholars to show whether the practice of staining the nails began in\r\nEgypt under this or that dynasty, before or after certain relations were\r\nestablished with Eastern nations. It is enough for our purpose to know\r\nthat _Lawsonia_, a shrub belonging to the order of the Lythraceæ, is\r\nmore or less wild in the warm regions of Western Asia and of Africa to\r\nthe north of the equator.\r\n\r\nI have in my possession specimens from India, Java, Timor, even from\r\nChina[661] and Nubia, which are not said to be taken from cultivated\r\nplants, and others from Guiana and the West Indies, which are doubtless\r\nfurnished by the imported species. Stocks found it indigenous in\r\nBeluchistan.[662] Roxburgh also considered it to be wild on the\r\nCoromandel[663] coast, and Thwaites[664] mentions it in Ceylon in a\r\nmanner which seems to show that it is wild there. Clarke[665] says,\r\n“very common, and cultivated in India, perhaps wild in the eastern\r\npart.” It is possible that it spread into India from its original home,\r\nas into Amboyna[666] in the seventeenth century, and perhaps more\r\nrecently into the West Indies,[667] in the wake of cultivation; for the\r\nplant is valued for the scent of its flowers, as well as for the dye,\r\nand is easily propagated by seed. There is the same doubt as to whether\r\nit is indigenous in Persia, Arabia, and Egypt (an essentially cultivated\r\ncountry), in Nubia, and even in Guinea, where specimens have been\r\ngathered.[668] It is even possible that the area of this shrub extends\r\nfrom India to Nubia. Such a wide geographical distribution is, however,\r\nalways somewhat rare. The common names may furnish some indication.\r\n\r\nA Sanskrit name, _sakachera_,[669] is attributed to the species, but as\r\nit has left no trace in the different modern languages of India, I am\r\ninclined to doubt its reality. The Persian name _hanna_ is more widely\r\ndiffused and retained than any other (_hina_ of the Hindus, _henneh_ and\r\n_alhenna_ of the Arabs, _kinna_ of the modern Greeks). That of _cypros_,\r\nused by the Syrians of the time of Dioscorides,[670] has not found so\r\nmuch favour. This fact supports the opinion that the species grew\r\noriginally on the borders of Persia, and that its use as well as its\r\ncultivation spread from the East to the West, from Asia into Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Tobacco+—_Nicotiana Tabacum_, Linnæus; and other species of\r\n_Nicotiana_.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the discovery of America, the custom of smoking, of\r\nsnuff-taking, or of chewing tobacco was diffused over the greater part\r\nof this vast continent. The accounts of the earliest travellers, of\r\nwhich the famous anatomist Tiedemann[671] has made a very complete\r\ncollection, show that the inhabitants of South America did not smoke,\r\nbut chewed tobacco or took snuff, except in the district of La Plata,\r\nUruguay, and Paraguay, where no form of tobacco was used. In North\r\nAmerica, from the Isthmus of Panama and the West Indies as far as Canada\r\nand California, the custom of smoking was universal, and circumstances\r\nshow that it was also very ancient. Pipes, in great numbers and of\r\nwonderful workmanship, have been discovered in the tombs of the Aztecs\r\nin Mexico[672] and in the mounds of the United States; some of them\r\nrepresent animals foreign to North America.[673]\r\n\r\nAs the tobacco plant is an annual which gives a great quantity of seeds,\r\nit was easy to sow and to cultivate or naturalize them more or less in\r\nthe neighbourhood of dwellings, but it must be noted that different\r\nspecies of the genus Nicotiana were employed in different parts of\r\nAmerica, which shows that they had not all the same origin. _Nicotiana\r\nTabacum_, commonly cultivated, was the most widely diffused, and\r\nsometimes the only one in use in South America and the West Indies. The\r\nuse of tobacco was introduced into La Plata, Paraguay,[674] and Uruguay\r\nby the Spaniards, consequently we must look further to the north for the\r\norigin of the plant. De Martius does not think it was indigenous in\r\nBrazil,[675] and he adds that the ancient Brazilians smoked the leaves\r\nof a species belonging to their country known to botanists as _Nicotiana\r\nLangsdorfii_. When I went into the question in 1855,[676] I had not been\r\nable to discover any wild specimens of _Nicotiana Tabacum_ except those\r\nsent by Blanchet from the province of Bahia, numbered 3223, _a_. No\r\nauthor, either before or since that time, has been more fortunate, and I\r\nsee that Messrs. Flückiger and Hanbury, in their excellent work on\r\nvegetable drugs,[677] say positively, “The common tobacco is a native of\r\nthe new world, though not now known in a wild state.” I venture to\r\ngainsay this assertion, although the wild nature of a plant may always\r\nbe disputed in the case of a plant which spreads so easily from\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nWe find in herbaria a number of specimens gathered in Peru without\r\nindication that they were cultivated or that they grew near plantations.\r\nBoissier’s herbarium contains two specimens collected by Pavon, from\r\ndifferent localities.[678] Pavon says in his flora that the species\r\ngrows in the moist warm forests of the Peruvian Andes, and that it is\r\ncultivated. But—and this is more significant—Edouard André gathered\r\nspecimens in the republic of Ecquador at Saint Nicholas, on the western\r\nslope of the volcano of Corazon in a virgin forest. These he was kind\r\nenough to send me. They are evidently the tall variety (four to six\r\nfeet) of _N. Tabacum_, with the upper leaves narrow and acuminate, as\r\nthey are represented in the plates of Hayne and Miller.[679] The lower\r\nleaves are wanting. The flower, which gives the true characters of the\r\nspecies, is certainly that of _N. Tabacum_, and it is well known that\r\nthe height of this plant and the breadth of the leaves vary in\r\ncultivation.[680] It is very possible that its original country extended\r\nnorth as far as Mexico, as far south as Bolivia, and eastward to\r\nVenezuela.\r\n\r\n_Nicotiana rustica_, Linnæus, a species with yellow flowers, very\r\ndifferent from _Tabacum_,[681] and which yields a coarse kind of\r\ntobacco, was more often cultivated by the Mexicans and the native tribes\r\nnorth of Mexico. I have a specimen brought from California by Douglas in\r\n1837, a time when colonists were still few; but American authorities do\r\nnot admit that the plant is wild, and Dr. Asa Gray says that it sows\r\nitself in waste places.[682] This was perhaps the case with the\r\nspecimens in Boissier’s herbarium, gathered in Peru by Pavon, and which\r\nhe does not mention in the Peruvian flora. The species grows in\r\nabundance about Cordova in the Argentine Republic,[683] but from what\r\nepoch is unknown. From the ancient use of the plant and the home of the\r\nmost analogous species, the probabilities are in favour of a Mexican,\r\nTexan, or Californian origin.\r\n\r\nSeveral botanists, even Americans, have believed that the species came\r\nfrom the old world. This is certainly a mistake, although the plant has\r\nspread here and there even into our forests, and sometimes in\r\nabundance,[684] having escaped from cultivation. Authors of the\r\nsixteenth century spoke of it as a foreign plant introduced into gardens\r\nand sometimes spreading from them.[685] It occurs in some herbaria under\r\nthe names of _N. tartarica_, _turcica_, or _sibirica_; but these are\r\ngarden-grown specimens, and no botanist has found the species in Asia,\r\nor on the borders of Asia, with any appearance of wildness.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to refute a widespread and more persistent error, in spite\r\nof what I proved in 1855, namely, that of regarding some species ill\r\ndescribed from cultivated specimens as natives of the old world, of Asia\r\nin particular. The proofs of an American origin are so numerous and\r\nconsistent that, without entering much into detail, I may sum them up as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n_A._ Out of fifty species of the genus Nicotiana found in a wild state,\r\ntwo only are foreign to America; namely, _N. suavolens_ of New Holland,\r\nwith which is joined _N. rotundifolia_ of the same country, and that\r\nwhich Ventinat had wrongly styled _N. undulata_; and _N. fragans_,\r\nHooker, of the Isle of Pines, near New Caledonia, which differs very\r\nlittle from the preceding.\r\n\r\n_B._ Though the Asiatic people are great lovers of tobacco, and have\r\nfrom a very early epoch sought the smoke of certain narcotic plants,\r\nnone of them made use of tobacco before the discovery of America.\r\nTiedemann has distinctly proved this fact by thorough researches into\r\nthe writings of travellers in the Middle Ages.[686] He even quotes for a\r\nlater epoch, not long after the discovery of America, between 1540 and\r\n1603, the fact that several travellers, some of whom were botanists,\r\nsuch as Belon and Rauwolf, who travelled through the Turkish and Persian\r\nempires, observing their customs with much attention, have not once\r\nmentioned tobacco. It was evidently introduced into Turkey at the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century, and the Persians soon received it\r\nfrom the Turks. The first European who mentions the smoking of tobacco\r\nin Persia is Thomas Herbert, in 1626. No later travellers have omitted\r\nto notice the use of the hookah as well established. Olearius describes\r\nthis apparatus, which he saw in 1633. The first mention of tobacco in\r\nIndia is in 1605,[687] and it is probable that it was of European\r\nintroduction. It was first introduced at Arracan and Pegu, in 1619,\r\naccording to the traveller Methold.[688] There are doubts about Java,\r\nbecause Rumphius, a very accurate observer, who wrote in the second half\r\nof the seventeenth century, says[689] that, according to the tradition\r\nof some old people, tobacco had been employed as a medicine before the\r\narrival of the Portuguese in 1496, and that only the practice of smoking\r\nit had been communicated by the Europeans. Rumphius adds, it is true,\r\nthat the name _tabaco_ or _tambuco_, which is in use in all these\r\nplaces, is of foreign origin. Sir Stamford Raffles,[690] in his numerous\r\nhistorical researches on Java, gives, on the other hand, the year 1601\r\nas the date of the introduction of tobacco into Java. The Portuguese had\r\ncertainly discovered the coasts of Brazil between 1500 and 1504, but\r\nVasco di Gama and his successors went to Asia round the Cape, or through\r\nthe Red Sea, so that they could hardly have established frequent or\r\ndirect communications between America and Java. Nicot had seen the plant\r\nin Portugal in 1560, so that the Portuguese probably introduced it into\r\nAsia in the latter half of the sixteenth century. Thunberg affirms[691]\r\nthat the use of tobacco was introduced into Japan by the Portuguese, and\r\naccording to early travellers quoted by Tiedemann, this was at the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century. Lastly, the Chinese have no\r\noriginal and ancient sign for tobacco; their paintings on china in the\r\nDresden collection often present, from the year 1700 and never before\r\nthat date, details relating to tobacco,[692] and Chinese students are\r\nagreed that Chinese works do not mention the plant before the end of the\r\nsixteenth century.[693] If it be remembered with what rapidity the use\r\nof tobacco has spread wherever it has been introduced, these data about\r\nAsia have an incontestable force.\r\n\r\n_C_. The common names of tobacco confirm its American origin. If there\r\nhad been any indigenous species in the old world there would be a great\r\nnumber of different names; but, on the contrary, the Chinese, Japanese,\r\nJavanese, Indian, Persian, etc., names are derived from the American\r\nnames, _petum_, or _tabak_, _tabok_, _tamboc_, slightly modified. It is\r\ntrue that Piddington gives Sanskrit names, _dhumrapatra_ and\r\n_tamrakouta_,[694] but Adolphe Pictet informs me that the first of these\r\nnames, which is not in Wilson’s dictionary, means only leaf for smoking,\r\nand appears to be of modern composition; while the second is probably no\r\nolder, and seems to be a modern modification of the American names. The\r\nArabic word _docchan_ simply means smoke.[695]\r\n\r\nLastly, we must inquire into the two so-called Asiatic _Nicotianæ_. The\r\none, called by Lehmann _Nicotiana chinensis_, came from the Russian\r\nbotanist Fischer, who said it was Chinese. Lehmann said he had seen it\r\nin a garden. Now, it is well known how often an erroneous origin is\r\nattributed to plants grown by horticulturists, and besides, from the\r\ndescription, it seems that it was simply _N. Tabacum_, of which the\r\nseeds had perhaps come from China.[696] The second species is _N.\r\npersica_, Lindley, figured in the _Botanical Register_ (pl. 1592), of\r\nwhich the seeds had been sent from Ispahan to the Horticultural Society\r\nof London, as those of the best tobacco cultivated in Persia, that of\r\nSchiraz. Lindley did not observe that it corresponded exactly to _N.\r\nalata_, drawn three years before by Link and Otto[697] from a plant in\r\nthe gardens at Berlin. The latter was grown from seed sent by Sello from\r\nSouthern Brazil. It is certainly a Brazilian species, with a white\r\nelongated corolla, allied to _N. suaveolens_ of New Holland. Thus the\r\ntobacco cultivated sometimes in Persia along with the common species, is\r\nof American origin, as I declared in my _Geographical Botany_ of 1855. I\r\ndo not understand how this species was introduced into Persia. It must\r\nhave been from seed taken from a garden, or brought by chance from\r\nAmerica, and it is not likely that its cultivation is common in Persia,\r\nfor Olivier and Bruguière, and other naturalists who have observed the\r\ntobacco plantations in that country, make no mention of it.\r\n\r\nFrom all these reasons I conclude that no species of tobacco is a native\r\nof Asia. They are all American, except _N. suaveolens_ of New Holland,\r\nand _N. fragrans_ of the Isle of Pines to the south of New Caledonia.\r\n\r\nSeveral _Nicotianæ_, besides _N. tabacum_ and _N. rustica_, have been\r\ncultivated here and there by savages, or as a curiosity by Europeans. It\r\nis strange that so little notice is taken of these attempts, by means of\r\nwhich very choice tobacco might be obtained. The species with white\r\nflowers would yield probably a light and perfumed tobacco, and as some\r\nsmokers seek the strongest tobaccos and the most disagreeable to\r\nnon-smokers, I would recommend to their notice _N. angustifolia_ of\r\nChili, which the natives call _tabaco del diablo_.[698]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Cinnamon+—_Cinnamonum zeylanicum_, Breyn.\r\n\r\nThis little tree, belonging to the laurel tribe, of which the bark of\r\nthe young branches forms the cinnamon of commerce, grows in great\r\nquantities in the forests of Ceylon. Certain varieties which grow wild\r\non the continent of India were formerly considered to be so many\r\ndistinct species, but Anglo-Indian botanists are agreed in connecting\r\nthem with that of Ceylon.[699]\r\n\r\nThe bark of _C. zeylanicum_, and that of several uncultivated species of\r\n_Cinnamonum_, which produce the _cassia_, or _Chinese cassia_, have been\r\nan important article of commerce from a very early period. Flückiger and\r\nHanbury[700] have treated of this historical question with so much\r\nlearning and thoroughness, that we need only refer to their work,\r\nentitled _Pharmacographia, or History of the Principal Drugs of\r\nVegetable Origin_. It is important from our point of view to note how\r\nmodern the culture is of the cinnamon tree in comparison with the trade\r\nin its product. It was only between 1765 and 1770 that a Ceylon\r\ncolonist, named de Koke, aided by Falck, the governor of the island,\r\nmade some plantations which were wonderfully successful. They have\r\ndiminished in Ceylon in the last few years, but others have been\r\nestablished in the tropical regions of the old and new worlds. The\r\nspecies becomes easily naturalized beyond the limits of\r\ncultivation,[701] as birds are fond of the fruit, and drop the seeds in\r\nthe forests.\r\n\r\n\r\n+China Grass+—_Boehmeria nivea_, Hooker and Arnott.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this valuable _Urticacea_ has been introduced into\r\nthe south of France and of the United States for about thirty years, but\r\ncommerce had previously acquainted us with the great value of its\r\nfibres, more tenacious than hemp and in some cases flexible as silk.\r\nInteresting details on the manner of cultivating the plant and of\r\nextracting its fibres[702] may be found in several books; I shall\r\nconfine myself here to defining as clearly as I can its geographical\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nTo attain this end we must not trust to the vague expressions of most\r\nauthors, nor to the labels attached to the specimens in herbaria, since\r\nfrequently no distinction has been made between cultivated, naturalized,\r\nor truly wild plants, and the two varieties of _Boehmeria nivea_\r\n(_Urtica nivea_, Linnæus), and _Boehmeria tenacissima_, Gaudichaud, or\r\n_B. candicans_, Hasskarl, have been confounded together; forms which\r\nappear to be varieties of the same species, because transitions between\r\nthem have been observed by botanists. There is also a sub-variety, with\r\nleaves green on both sides, cultivated by Americans and by M. de\r\nMalartic in the south of France.\r\n\r\nThe variety earliest known (_Urtica nivea_, L.), with leaves white on\r\nthe under side, is said to grow in China and some neighbouring\r\ncountries. Linnæus says it is found on walls in China, which would imply\r\na plant naturalized on rubbish-heaps from cultivation. But Loureiro[703]\r\nsays, “_habitat et abundanter colitur in Cochin-China et China_,” and\r\naccording to Bentham,[704] the collector Champion found it in abundance\r\nin the ravines of the island of Hongkong. According to Franchet and\r\nSavatier,[705] it exists in Japan in clearings and hedges (_in\r\nfruticetis umbrosis et sepibus_). Blanco[706] says it is common in the\r\nPhilippine Isles. I find no proof that it is wild in Java, Sumatra, and\r\nother islands of the Malay Archipelago. Rumphius[707] knew it only as a\r\ncultivated plant. Roxburgh[708] believed it to be a native of Sumatra,\r\nbut Miquel[709] does not confirm this belief. The other varieties have\r\nnowhere been found wild, which supports the theory that they are only\r\nthe result of cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Hemp+—_Cannabis sativa_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nHemp is mentioned, in its two forms, male and female, in the most\r\nancient Chinese works, particularly in the _Shu-King_, written 500\r\nB.C.[710]\r\n\r\nIt has Sanskrit names, _bhanga_ and _gangika_.[711] The root of these\r\nwords, _ang_ or _an_, recurs in all the Indo-European and modern\r\nSemitic languages: _bang_ in Hindu and Persian, _ganga_ in Bengali,[712]\r\n_hanf_ in German, _hemp_ in English, _chanvre_ in French, _kanas_ in\r\nKeltic and modern Breton,[713] _cannabis_ in Greek and Latin, _cannab_\r\nin Arabic.[714]\r\n\r\nAccording to Herodotus (born 484 B.C.), the Scythians used hemp, but in\r\nhis time the Greeks were scarcely acquainted with it.[715] Hiero II.,\r\nKing of Syracuse, bought the hemp used for the cordage of his vessels in\r\nGaul, and Lucilius is the earliest Roman writer who speaks of the plant\r\n(100 B.C.). Hebrew books do not mention hemp.[716] It was not used in\r\nthe fabrics which enveloped the mummies of ancient Egypt. Even at the\r\nend of the eighteenth century it was only cultivated in Egypt for the\r\nsake of an intoxicating liquid extracted from the plant.[717] The\r\ncompilation of Jewish laws known as the Talmud, made under the Roman\r\ndominion, speaks of its textile properties as of a little-known\r\nfact.[718] It seems probable that the Scythians transported this plant\r\nfrom Central Asia and from Russia when they migrated westward about 1500\r\nB.C., a little before the Trojan war. It may also have been introduced\r\nby the earlier incursions of the Aryans into Thrace and Western Europe;\r\nyet in that case it would have been earlier known in Italy. Hemp has not\r\nbeen found in the lake-dwellings of Switzerland[719] and Northern\r\nItaly.[720]\r\n\r\nThe observations on the habitat of _Cannabis sativa_ agree perfectly\r\nwith the data furnished by history and philology. I have treated\r\nspecially of this subject in a monograph in _Prodromus_, 1869.[721]\r\n\r\nThe species has been found wild, beyond a doubt, to the south of the\r\nCaspian Sea,[722] in Siberia, near the Irtysch, in the desert of the\r\nKirghiz, beyond Lake Baikal, in Dahuria (government of Irkutsh). Authors\r\nmention it also throughout Southern and Central Russia, and to the south\r\nof the Caucasus,[723] but its wild nature is here less certain, seeing\r\nthat these are populous countries, and that the seeds of the hemp are\r\neasily diffused from gardens. The antiquity of the cultivation of hemp\r\nin China leads me to believe that its area extends further to the east,\r\nalthough this has not yet been proved by botanists.[724] Boissier\r\nmentions the species as “almost wild in Persia.” I doubt whether it is\r\nindigenous there, since in that case the Greeks and Hebrews would have\r\nknown of it at an earlier period.\r\n\r\n\r\n+White Mulberry+—_Morus alba_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe mulberry tree, which is most commonly used in Europe for rearing\r\nsilkworms, is _Morus alba_. Its very numerous varieties have been\r\ncarefully described by Seringe,[725] and more recently by Bureau.[726]\r\nThat most widely cultivated in India, _Morus indica_, Linnæus (_Morus\r\nalba_, var. _Indica_, Bureau), is wild in the Punjab and in Sikkim,\r\naccording to Brandis, inspector-general of forests in British\r\nIndia.[727] Two other varieties, _serrata_ and _cuspidata_, are also\r\nsaid to be wild in different provinces of Northern India.[728] The Abbé\r\nDavid found a perfectly wild variety in Mongolia, described under the\r\nname of _mongolica_ by Bureau; and Dr. Bretschneider[729] quotes a name\r\n_yen_, from ancient Chinese authors, for the wild mulberry.\r\n\r\nIt is true he does not say whether this name applies to the white\r\nmulberry, _pe-sang_, of the Chinese plantations.[730] The antiquity of\r\nits culture in China,[731] and in Japan, and the number of different\r\nvarieties grown there, lead us to believe that its original area\r\nextended eastward as far as Japan; but the indigenous flora of Southern\r\nChina is little known, and the most trustworthy authors do not affirm\r\nthat the plant is indigenous in Japan. Franchet and Savatier[732] say\r\nthat it is “cultivated from time immemorial, and become wild here and\r\nthere.” It is worthy of note also that the white mulberry appears to\r\nthrive especially in mountainous and temperate countries, whence it may\r\nbe argued that it was formerly introduced from the north of China into\r\nthe plains of the south. It is known that birds are fond of the fruit,\r\nand bear the seeds to great distances and into uncultivated ground, and\r\nthis makes it difficult to discover its really original habitat.\r\n\r\nThis facility of naturalization doubtless explains the presence in\r\nsuccessive epochs of the white mulberry in Western Asia and the south of\r\nEurope. This must have occurred especially after the monks brought the\r\nsilkworm to Constantinople under Justinian in the sixth century, and as\r\nthe culture of silkworms was gradually propagated westwards. However,\r\nTargioni has proved that only the black mulberry, _M. nigra_, was known\r\nin Sicily and Italy when the manufacture of silk was introduced into\r\nSicily in 1148, and two centuries later into Tuscany.[733] According to\r\nthe same author, the introduction of the white mulberry into Tuscany\r\ndates at the earliest from the year 1340. In like manner the manufacture\r\nof silk may have begun in China, because the silkworm is natural to that\r\ncountry; but it is very probable that the tree grew also in the north of\r\nIndia, where so many travellers have found it wild. In Persia, Armenia,\r\nand Asia Minor, I am inclined to believe that it was naturalized at a\r\nvery early epoch, rather than to share Grisebach’s opinion that it is\r\nindigenous in the basin of the Caspian Sea. Boissier does not give it\r\nas wild in that region.[734] Buhse[735] found it in Persia, near Erivan\r\nand Bashnaruschin, and he adds, “naturalized in abundance in Ghilan and\r\nMasenderan.” Ledebour,[736] in his Russian flora, mentions numerous\r\nlocalities round the Caucasus, but he does not specify whether the\r\nspecies is wild or naturalized. In the Crimea, Greece, and Italy, it\r\nexists only in a cultivated state.[737] A variety, _tatarica_, often\r\ncultivated in the south of Russia, has become naturalized near the\r\nVolga.[738]\r\n\r\nIf the white mulberry did not originally exist in Persia and in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Caspian Sea, it must have penetrated there a long\r\nwhile ago. I may quote in proof of this the name _tut_, _tutti_, _tuta_,\r\nwhich is Persian, Arabic, Turkish, and Tartar. There is a Sanskrit name,\r\n_tula_,[739] which must be connected with the same root as the Persian\r\nname; but no Hebrew name is known, which is a confirmation of the theory\r\nof a successive extension towards the west of Asia.\r\n\r\nI refer those of my readers who may desire more detailed information\r\nabout the introduction of the mulberry and of silkworms to the able\r\nworks of Targioni and Ritter, to which I have already referred. Recent\r\ndiscoveries made by various botanists have permitted me to add more\r\nprecise data than those of Ritter on the question of origin, and if\r\nthere are some apparent contradictions in our opinions on other points,\r\nit is because the famous geographer has considered a number of varieties\r\nas so many different species, whereas botanists, after a careful\r\nexamination, have classed them together.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Black Mulberry+—_Morus nigra_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis tree is more valued for its fruit than for its leaves, and on that\r\naccount I should have included it in the list of fruit trees; but its\r\nhistory can hardly be separated from that of the white mulberry.\r\nMoreover, its leaves are employed in many countries for the feeding of\r\nsilkworms, although the silk produced is of inferior quality.\r\n\r\nThe black mulberry is distinguished from the white by several characters\r\nindependently of the black colour of the fruit, which occurs also in a\r\nfew varieties of the _M. alba_.[740] It has not a great number of\r\nvarieties like the latter, which argues a less ancient and a less\r\ngeneral cultivation and a narrower primitive area.\r\n\r\nGreek and Latin authors, even the poets, have mentioned _Morus nigra_,\r\nwhich they compare to _Ficus sycomorus_, and which they even confounded\r\noriginally with this Egyptian tree.\r\n\r\nCommentators for the last two centuries have quoted a number of passages\r\nwhich leave no doubt on this head, but which are devoid of interest in\r\nthemselves.[741] They furnish no proof touching the origin of the\r\nspecies, which is presumably Persian, unless we are to take seriously\r\nthe fable of Pyramus and Thisbe, of which the scene was in Babylonia,\r\naccording to Ovid.\r\n\r\nBotanists have not yet furnished any certain proof that this species is\r\nindigenous in Persia. Boissier, who is the most learned in the floras of\r\nthe East, contents himself with quoting Hohenacker as the discoverer of\r\n_M. nigra_ in the forests of Lenkoran, on the south coast of the Caspian\r\nSea, and he adds, “probably wild in the north of Persia near the Caspian\r\nSea.”[742] Ledebour, in his Russian flora, had previously indicated, on\r\nthe authority of different travellers, the Crimea and the provinces\r\nsouth of the Caucasus;[743] but Steven denies the existence of the\r\nspecies in the Crimea except in a cultivated state.[744] Tchihatcheff\r\nand Koch found the black mulberry in high wild districts of Armenia. It\r\nis very probable that in the region to the south of the Caucasus and of\r\nthe Caspian Sea _Morus nigra_ is wild and indigenous rather than\r\nnaturalized. What leads me to this belief is (1) that it is not known,\r\neven in a cultivated state, in India, China, or Japan; (2) that it has\r\nno Sanskrit name; (3) that it was so early introduced into Greece, a\r\ncountry which had intercourse with Armenia at an early period.[745]\r\n\r\n_Morus nigra_ spread so little to the south of Persia, that no certain\r\nHebrew name is known for it, nor even a Persian name distinct from that\r\nof _Morus alba_. It was widely cultivated in Italy until the superiority\r\nof the white mulberry for the rearing of silkworms was recognized. In\r\nGreece the black mulberry is still the most cultivated.[746] It has\r\nbecome naturalized here and there in these countries and in Spain.[747]\r\n\r\n\r\n+American Aloe+—_Agave Americana_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis ligneous plant, of the order of _Amaryllidaceæ_, has been\r\ncultivated from time immemorial in Mexico under the names _maguey_ or\r\n_metl_, in order to extract from it, at the moment when the flower stem\r\nis developed, the wine known as _pulque_. Humboldt has given a full\r\ndescription of this culture,[748] and he tells us elsewhere[749] that\r\nthe species grows in the whole of South America as far as five thousand\r\nfeet of altitude. It is mentioned[750] in Jamaica, Antigua, Dominica,\r\nand Cuba, but it must be observed that it multiplies easily by suckers,\r\nand that it is often planted far from dwellings to form fences or to\r\nextract from it the fibre known as _pite_, and this makes it difficult\r\nto ascertain its original habitat. Transported long since into the\r\ncountries which border the Mediterranean, it occurs there with every\r\nappearance of an indigenous species, although there is no doubt as to\r\nits origin.[751] Probably, to judge from the various uses made of it in\r\nMexico before the arrival of the Europeans, it came originally from\r\nthence.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Sugar-Cane+—_Saccharum officinarum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the sugar-cane, of its cultivation, and of the manufacture\r\nof sugar, are the subject of a very remarkable work by the geographer,\r\nKarl Ritter.[752] I need not follow his purely agricultural and\r\neconomical details; but for that which interests us particularly, the\r\nprimitive habitat of the species, he is the best guide, and the facts\r\nobserved during the last forty years for the most part support or\r\nconfirm his opinions.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-cane is cultivated at the present day in all the warm regions\r\nof the globe, but a number of historical facts testify that it was first\r\ngrown in Southern Asia, whence it spread into Africa, and later into\r\nAmerica. The question is, therefore, to discover in what districts of\r\nthe continent, or in which of the southern islands of Asia, the plant\r\nexists, or existed at the time it was first employed.\r\n\r\nRitter has followed the best methods of arriving at a solution. He notes\r\nfirst that all the species known in a wild state, and undoubtedly\r\nbelonging to the genus _Saccharum_, grow in India, except one in\r\nEgypt.[753] Five species have since been described, growing in Java, New\r\nGuinea, Timor, and the Philippine Isles.[754] The probabilities are all\r\nin favour of an Asiatic origin, to judge from the data furnished by\r\ngeographical botany.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately no botanist had discovered at the time when Ritter wrote,\r\nor has since discovered, _Saccharum officinarum_ wild in India, in the\r\nadjacent countries or in the archipelago to the south of Asia. All\r\nAnglo-Indian authors, Roxburgh, Wallich, Royle, etc., and more recently\r\nAitchison,[755] only mention the plant as a cultivated one. Roxburgh,\r\nwho was so long a collector in India, says expressly, “where wild I do\r\nnot know.” The family of the _Gramineæ_ has not yet appeared in Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker’s flora. For the island of Ceylon, Thwaites does not even\r\nmention the cultivated plant.[756] Rumphius, who has carefully described\r\nits cultivation in the Dutch colonies, says nothing about the home of\r\nthe species. Miquel, Hasskarl, and Blanco mention no wild specimen in\r\nSumatra, Java, or the Philippine Isles. Crawfurd tried to discover it,\r\nbut failed to do so.[757] At the time of Cook’s voyage Forster found the\r\nsugar-cane only as a cultivated plant in the small islands of the\r\nPacific.[758] The natives of New Caledonia cultivate a number of\r\nvarieties of the sugar-cane, and use it constantly, sucking the syrup\r\nfrom the cane; but Vieillard[759] takes care to say, “From the fact that\r\nisolated plants of _Saccharum officinarum_ are often found in the middle\r\nof the bush and even on the mountains, it would be wrong to conclude\r\nthat the plant is indigenous; for these specimens, poor and weak, only\r\nmark the site of old plantations, or are sprung from fragments of cane\r\nleft by the natives, who seldom travel without a piece of cane in the\r\nhand.” In 1861, Bentham, who had access to the rich herbarium of Kew,\r\nsays, in his _Flora of Hongkong_, “We have no authentic and certain\r\nproof of a locality where the common sugar-cane is wild.”\r\n\r\nI do not know, however, why Ritter and every one else has neglected an\r\nassertion of Loureiro, in his _Flora of Cochin-China_,[760] “Habitat, et\r\ncolitur abundantissime in omnibus provinciis regni Cochin-Chinensis:\r\nsimul in aliquibus imperii sinensis, sed minori copia.” The word\r\n_habitat_, separated by a comma from the rest, is a distinct assertion.\r\nLoureiro could not have been mistaken about the _Saccharum officinarum_,\r\nwhich he saw cultivated all about him, and of which he enumerates the\r\nprincipal varieties. He must have seen plants wild, at least in\r\nappearance. They may have spread from some neighbouring plantation, but\r\nI know nothing which makes it unlikely that the plant should be\r\nindigenous in this warm moist district of the continent of Asia.\r\n\r\nForskal[761] mentions the species as wild in the mountains of Arabia,\r\nunder a name which he believes to be Indian. If it came from Arabia, it\r\nwould have spread into Egypt long ago, and the Hebrews would have known\r\nit.\r\n\r\nRoxburgh had received in the botanical gardens of Calcutta in 1796, and\r\nhad introduced into the plantations in Bengal, a _Saccharum_ to which he\r\ngave the name of _S. sinense_, and of which he published an illustration\r\nin his great work _Plantæ Coromandelianæ_, vol. iii. pl. 232. It is\r\nperhaps only a form of _S. officinarum_, and moreover, as it is only\r\nknown in a cultivated state, it tells nothing about the primitive\r\ncountry either of this or of any other variety.\r\n\r\nA few botanists have asserted that the sugar-cane flowers more often in\r\nAsia than in America or Africa, and even that it produces seed[762] on\r\nthe banks of the Ganges, which they regard as a proof that it is\r\nindigenous. Macfadyen says so without giving any proof. It was an\r\nassertion made to him in Jamaica by some traveller; but Sir W. Hooker\r\nadds in a note, “Dr. Roxburgh, in spite of his long residence on the\r\nbanks of the Ganges, has never seen the seeds of the sugar-cane.” It\r\nrarely flowers, and still more rarely bears fruit, as is commonly the\r\ncase with plants propagated by buds or suckers, and if any variety of\r\nsugar-cane were disposed to seed, it would probably be less productive\r\nof sugar and would soon be abandoned. Rumphius, a better observer than\r\nmany modern botanists, has given a good description of the cultivated\r\ncane in the Dutch colonies, and makes an interesting remark.[763] “It\r\nnever produces flowers or fruit unless it has remained several years in\r\na stony place.” Neither he, nor any one else to my knowledge, has\r\ndescribed or drawn the seed. The flower, on the contrary, has often been\r\nfigured, and I have a fine specimen from Martinique.[764] Schacht is the\r\nonly person who has given a good analysis of the flower, including the\r\npistil; he had not seen the seed ripe.[765] De Tussac,[766] who gives a\r\npoor analysis, speaks of the seed, but he only saw it young in the\r\novary.\r\n\r\nIn default of precise information as to the native country of the\r\nspecies, accessory means, linguistic and historical, of proving an\r\nAsiatic origin, are of some interest. Ritter gives them carefully; I\r\nwill content myself with an epitome. The Sanskrit name of the sugar-cane\r\nwas _ikshu_, _ikshura_, or _ikshava_, but the sugar was called\r\n_sarkara_, or _sakkara_, and all its names in our European languages of\r\nAryan origin, beginning with the ancient ones—Greek, for example—are\r\nclearly derived from this. This is an indication of Asiatic origin, and\r\nthat the produce of the cane was of ancient use in the southern regions\r\nof Asia with which the ancient Sanskrit-speaking nation may have had\r\ncommercial dealings. The two Sanskrit words have remained in Bengali\r\nunder the forms _ik_ and _akh_.[767] But in other languages beyond the\r\nIndus, we find a singular variety of names, at least when they are not\r\nakin to that of the Aryans; for instance: _panchadara_ in Telinga,\r\n_kyam_ in Burmese, _mia_ in the dialect of Cochin-China, _kan_ and\r\n_tche_, or _tsche_, in Chinese; and further south, among the Malays,\r\n_tubu_ or _tabu_ for the plant, and _gula_ for the product. This\r\ndiversity proves the great antiquity of its cultivation in those\r\nregions of Asia in which botanical indications point out the origin of\r\nthe species.\r\n\r\nThe epoch of its introduction into different countries agrees with the\r\nidea that its origin was in India, Cochin-China, or the Malay\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese were not acquainted with the sugar-cane at a very remote\r\nperiod, and they received it from the West. Ritter contradicts those\r\nauthors who speak of a very ancient cultivation, and I find most\r\npositive confirmation of his opinion in Dr. Bretschneider’s pamphlet,\r\ndrawn up at Pekin with the aid of all the resources of Chinese\r\nliterature.[768] “I have not been able to discover,” he says, “any\r\nallusion to the sugar-cane in the most ancient Chinese books (the five\r\nclassics).” It appears to have been mentioned for the first time by the\r\nauthors of the second century before Christ. The first description of it\r\nappears in the _Nan-fang-tsao-mu-chuang_, in the fourth century: “The\r\n_chê chê, kan-chê_ (_kan_, sweet, _chê_, bamboo) grows,” it says, “in\r\nCochin-China. It is several inches in circumference, and resembles the\r\nbamboo. The stem, broken into pieces, is eatable and very sweet. The sap\r\nwhich is drawn from it is dried in the sun. After a few days it becomes\r\nsugar (here a compound Chinese character), which melts in the mouth....\r\nIn the year 286 (of our era) the kingdom of Funan (in India, beyond the\r\nGanges) sent sugar as a tribute.” According to the _Pent-Sao_, an\r\nemperor who reigned from 627 to 650 A.D., sent a man into the Indian\r\nprovince of Behar to learn how to manufacture sugar.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing said in these works of the plant growing wild in China;\r\non the contrary, the origin in Cochin-China, indicated by Loureiro,\r\nfinds an unexpected confirmation. It seems to me most probable that its\r\nprimitive range extended from Bengal to Cochin-China. It may have\r\nincluded the Sunda Isles and the Moluccas, whose climate is very\r\nsimilar; but there are quite as many reasons for believing that it was\r\nearly introduced into these from Cochin-China or the Malay peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe propagation of the sugar-cane from India westward is well known. The\r\nGreco-Roman world had a vague idea of the reed (_calamus_) which the\r\nIndians delighted to chew, and from which they obtained sugar.[769] On\r\nthe other hand, the Hebrew writings do not mention sugar;[770] whence we\r\nmay infer that the cultivation of the sugar-cane did not exist west of\r\nthe Indus at the time of the Jewish captivity at Babylon. The Arabs in\r\nthe Middle Ages introduced it into Egypt, Sicily, and the south of\r\nSpain,[771] where it flourished until the abundance of sugar in the\r\ncolonies caused it to be abandoned. Don Henriquez transported the\r\nsugar-cane from Sicily to Madeira, whence it was taken to the Canaries\r\nin 1503.[772] Hence it was introduced into Brazil in the beginning of\r\nthe sixteenth century.[773] It was taken to St. Domingo about 1520, and\r\nshortly afterwards to Mexico;[774] to Guadeloupe in 1644, to Martinique\r\nabout 1650, to Bourbon when the colony was founded.[775] The variety\r\nknown as _Otahiti_, which is not, however, wild in that island, and\r\nwhich is also called _Bourbon_, was introduced into the French and\r\nEnglish colonies at the end of the last and the beginning of the present\r\ncentury.[776]\r\n\r\nThe processes of cultivation and preparation of the sugar are described\r\nin a number of works, among which the following may be recommended: de\r\nTussac, _Flore des Antilles_, 3 vols., Paris; vol. i. pp. 151-182; and\r\nMacfadyen, in Hooker’s _Botanical Miscellany_, 1830, vol. i. pp.\r\n103-116.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPLANTS CULTIVATED FOR THEIR FLOWERS, OR FOR THE ORGANS WHICH ENVELOP\r\nTHEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Clove+—_Caryophyllus aromaticus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe clove used for domestic purposes is the calix and flower-bud of a\r\nplant belonging to the order of Myrtaceæ. Although the plant has been\r\noften described and very well drawn from cultivated specimens, some\r\ndoubt remains as to its nature when wild. I spoke of it in my\r\n_Geographical Botany_ in 1855, but it does not appear that the question\r\nhas made any further progress since then, which induces me to repeat\r\nhere what I said then.\r\n\r\n“The clove must have come originally from the Moluccas,” as Rumphius\r\nasserts,[777] for its cultivation was limited two centuries ago to a few\r\nlittle islands in this archipelago. I cannot, however, find any proof\r\nthat the true clove tree, with peduncles and aromatic buds, has been\r\nfound in a wild state. Rumphius[778] considers that a plant of which he\r\ngives a description, and a drawing under the name _Caryophyllum\r\nsylvestre_, belongs to the same species, and this plant is wild\r\nthroughout the Moluccas. A native told him that the cultivated clove\r\ntrees degenerate into this form, and Rumphius himself found a plant of\r\n_C. sylvestre_ in a deserted plantation of cultivated cloves.\r\nNevertheless plate 3 differs from plate 1 of the cultivated clove in the\r\nshape of the leaves and of the teeth of the calix. I do not speak of\r\nplate 2, which appears to be an abnormal form of the cultivated clove.\r\nRumphius says that _C. sylvestre_ has no aromatic properties; now, as a\r\nrule, the aromatic properties are more developed in the wild plants of a\r\nspecies than in the cultivated plants. Sonnerat[779] also publishes\r\nfigures of the true clove and of a spurious clove found in a small\r\nisland near the country of the Papuans. It is easy to see that his\r\nfalse clove differs completely by its blunt leaves from the true clove,\r\nand also from the two species of Rumphius. I cannot make up my mind to\r\nclass all these different plants, wild and cultivated, together, as all\r\nauthors have done.[780] It is especially necessary to exclude plate 120\r\nof Sonnerat, which is admitted in the _Botanical Magazine_. An\r\nhistorical account of the cultivation of the clove, and of its\r\nintroduction into different countries, will be found in the last-named\r\nwork, in the _Dictionnaire d’Agriculture_, and in the dictionaries of\r\nnatural history.\r\n\r\nIf it be true, as Roxburgh says,[781] that the Sanskrit language had a\r\nname, _luvunga_, for the clove, the trade in this spice must date from a\r\nvery early epoch, even supposing the name to be more modern than the\r\ntrue Sanskrit. But I doubt its genuine character, for the Romans would\r\nhave known of a substance so easily transported, and it does not appear\r\nthat it was introduced into Europe before the discovery of the Moluccas\r\nby the Portuguese.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Hop+—_Humulus Lupulus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe hop is wild in Europe from England and Sweden as far south as the\r\nmountains of the Mediterranean basin, and in Asia as far as Damascus, as\r\nthe south of the Caspian Sea, and of Eastern Siberia,[782] but it is not\r\nfound in India, the north of China, or the basin of the river Amur.[783]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the entirely wild appearance of the hop in Europe in\r\ndistricts far from cultivation, it has been sometimes asked if it is not\r\nof Asiatic origin.[784] I do not think this can be proved, nor even that\r\nit is likely. The fact that the Greeks and Latins have not spoken of the\r\nuse of the hop in making beer is easily explained, as they were almost\r\nentirely unacquainted with this drink. If the Greeks have not mentioned\r\nthe plant, it is simply perhaps because it is rare in their country.\r\nFrom the Italian name _lupulo_ it seems likely that Pliny speaks of it\r\nwith other vegetables under the name _lupus salictarius_.[785] That the\r\ncustom of brewing with hops only became general in the Middle Ages\r\nproves nothing, except that other plants were formerly employed, as is\r\nstill the case in some districts. The Kelts, the Germans, other peoples\r\nof the north and even of the south who had the vine, made beer[786]\r\neither of barley or of other fermented grain, adding in certain cases\r\ndifferent vegetable substances—the bark of the oak or of the tamarisk,\r\nfor instance, or the fruits of _Myrica gale_.[787] It is very possible\r\nthat they did not soon discover the advantages of the hop, and that even\r\nafter these were recognized, they employed wild hops before beginning to\r\ncultivate them. The first mention of hop-gardens occurs in an act of\r\ndonation made by Pepin, father of Charlemagne, in 768.[788] In the\r\nfourteenth century it was an important object of culture in Germany, but\r\nit began in England only under Henry VIII.[789]\r\n\r\nThe common names of the hop only furnish negative indications as to its\r\norigin. There is no Sanskrit name,[790] and this agrees with the absence\r\nof the species in the region of the Himalayas, and shows that the early\r\nAryan peoples had not noticed and employed it. I have quoted before[791]\r\nsome of the European names, showing their diversity, although some few\r\nof them may be derived from a common stock. Hehn, the philologist, has\r\ntreated of their etymology, and shown how obscure it is, but he has not\r\nmentioned the names totally distinct from _humle_, _hopf_ or _hop_, and\r\n_chmeli_ of the Scandinavian, Gothic, and Slav races; for example,\r\n_Apini_ in Lette, _Apwynis_ in Lithuanian, _tap_ in Esthonian, _blust_\r\nin Illyrian,[792] which have evidently other roots. This variety tends\r\nto confirm the theory that the species existed in Europe before the\r\narrival of the Aryan nations. Several different peoples must have\r\ndistinguished, known, and used this plant successively, which confirms\r\nits extension in Europe and in Asia before it was used in brewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Carthamine+—_Carthamus tinctorius_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe composite annual which produces the dye called carthamine is one of\r\nthe most ancient cultivated species. Its flowers are used for dyeing in\r\nred or yellow, and the seeds yield oil.\r\n\r\nThe grave-cloths which wrap the ancient Egyptian mummies are dyed with\r\ncarthamine,[793] and quite recently fragments of the plant have been\r\nfound in the tombs discovered at Deir el Bahari.[794] Its cultivation\r\nmust also be ancient in India, since there are two Sanskrit names for\r\nit, _cusumbha_ and _kamalottara_, of which the first has several\r\nderivatives in the modern languages of the peninsula.[795] The Chinese\r\nonly received carthamine in the second century B.C., when Chang-kien\r\nbrought it back from Bactriana.[796] The Greeks and Latins were probably\r\nnot acquainted with it, for it is very doubtful whether this is the\r\nplant which they knew as _cnikos_ or _cnicus_.[797] At a later period\r\nthe Arabs contributed largely to diffuse the cultivation of carthamine,\r\nwhich they named _qorton_, _kurtum_, whence _carthamine_, or _usfur_, or\r\n_ihridh_, or _morabu_,[798] a diversity indicating an ancient existence\r\nin several countries of Western Asia or of Africa. The progress of\r\nchemistry threatens to do away with the cultivation of this plant as of\r\nmany others, but it still subsists in the south of Europe, in the East,\r\nand throughout the valley of the Nile.[799]\r\n\r\nNo botanist has found the carthamine in a really wild state. Authors\r\ndoubtfully assign to it an origin in India or Africa, in Abyssinia in\r\nparticular, but they have never seen it except in a cultivated state, or\r\nwith every appearance of having escaped from cultivation.[800]\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke,[801] formerly director of the Botanical Gardens in Calcutta,\r\nwho has lately studied the _Compositæ_ of India, includes the species\r\nonly as a cultivated one. The summary of our modern knowledge of the\r\nplants of the Nile region, including Abyssinia, by Schweinfurth and\r\nAscherson,[802] only indicates it as a cultivated species, nor does the\r\nlist of the plants observed by Rohlfs on his recent journey mention a\r\nwild carthamine.[803]\r\n\r\nAs the species has not been found wild either in India or in Africa, and\r\nas it has been cultivated for thousands of years in both countries, the\r\nidea occurred to me of seeking its origin in the intermediate region; a\r\nmethod which had been successful in other cases.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the interior of Arabia is almost unknown. Forskal, who\r\nhas visited the coasts of Yemen has learnt nothing about the carthamine;\r\nnor is it mentioned among the plants of Botta and of Bové. But an Arab,\r\nAbu Anifa, quoted by Ebn Baithar, a thirteenth-century writer, expressed\r\nhimself as follows:[804]—“_Usfur_, this plant furnishes a substance used\r\nas a dye; there are two kinds, one cultivated and one wild, which both\r\ngrow in Arabia, of which the seeds are called _elkurthum_.” Abu Anifa\r\nwas very likely right.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Saffron+—_Crocus sativus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe saffron was cultivated in very early times in the west of Asia. The\r\nRomans praised the saffron of Cilicia, which they preferred to that\r\ngrown in Italy.[805] Asia Minor, Persia, and Kashmir have been for a\r\nlong time the countries which export the most. India gets it from\r\nKashmir[806] at the present day. Roxburgh and Wallich do not mention it\r\nin their works. The two Sanskrit names mentioned by Piddington[807]\r\nprobably applied to the substance saffron brought from the West, for the\r\nname _kasmirajamma_ appears to indicate its origin in Kashmir. The other\r\nname is _kunkuma_. The Hebrew word _karkom_ is commonly translated\r\nsaffron, but it more probably applies to carthamine, to judge from the\r\nname of the latter in Arabic.[808] Besides, the saffron is not\r\ncultivated in Egypt or in Arabia. The Greek name is _krokos_.[809]\r\nSaffron, which recurs in all modern European languages, comes from the\r\nArabic _sahafaran_,[810] _zafran_.[811] The Spaniards, nearer to the\r\nArabs, call it _azafran_. The Arabic name itself comes from _assfar_,\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nTrustworthy authors say that _C. sativus_ is wild in Greece[812] and in\r\nthe Abruzzi mountains in Italy.[813] Maw, who is preparing a monograph\r\nof the genus Crocus, based on a long series of observations in gardens\r\nand in herbaria, connects with _C. sativus_ six forms which are found\r\nwild in mountainous districts from Italy to Kurdistan. None of these, he\r\nsays,[814] are identical with the cultivated variety; but certain forms\r\ndescribed under other names (_C. Orisnii_, _C. Cartwrightianus_, _C.\r\nThomasii_), hardly differ from it. These are from Italy and Greece.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of saffron, of which the conditions are given in the\r\n_Cours d’Agriculture_ by Gasparin, and in the _Bulletin de la Société\r\nd’Acclimatation_ for 1870, is becoming more and more rare in Europe and\r\nAsia.[815] It has sometimes had the effect of naturalizing the species\r\nfor a few years at least in localities where it appears to be wild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPLANTS CULTIVATED FOR THEIR FRUITS.[816]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Sweet Sop, Sugar Apple+[817]—_Anona squamosa_, Linnæus. (In British\r\nIndia, +Custard Apple+; but this is the name of _Anona muricata_ in\r\nAmerica.)\r\n\r\nThe original home of this and other cultivated Anonaceæ has been the\r\nsubject of doubts, which make it an interesting problem. I attempted to\r\nresolve them in 1855. The opinion at which I then arrived has been\r\nconfirmed by the subsequent observations of travellers, and as it is\r\nuseful to show how far probabilities based upon sound methods lead to\r\ntrue assertions, I will transcribe what I then said,[818] mentioning\r\nafterwards the more recent discoveries.\r\n\r\n“Robert Brown proved in 1818 that all the species of the genus Anona,\r\nexcepting _Anona senegalensis_, belong to America, and none to Asia.\r\nAug. de Saint-Hilaire says that, according to Vellozo, _A. squamosa_ was\r\nintroduced into Brazil, that it is known there under the name of\r\n_pinha_, from its resemblance to a fir-cone, and of _ata_, evidently\r\nborrowed from the names _attoa_ and _atis_, which are those of the same\r\nplant in Asia, and which belong to Eastern languages. Therefore, adds de\r\nSaint-Hilaire,[819] the Portuguese transported _A. squamosa_ from their\r\nIndian to their American possessions, etc.”\r\n\r\nHaving made in 1832 a review of the family of the Anonaceæ,[820] I\r\nnoticed how Mr. Brown’s botanical argument was ever growing stronger;\r\nfor in spite of the considerable increase in the number of described\r\nAnonaceæ, no Anona, nor even any species of Anonaceæ with united\r\novaries, had been found to be a native of Asia. I admitted[821] the\r\nprobability that the species came from the West Indies or from the\r\nneighbouring part of the American continent; but I inadvertently\r\nattributed this opinion to Mr. Brown, who had merely indicated an\r\nAmerican origin in general.[822]\r\n\r\nFacts of different kinds have since confirmed this view.\r\n\r\n“_Anona squamosa_ has been found wild in Asia, apparently as a\r\nnaturalized plant; in Africa, and especially in America, with all the\r\nconditions of an indigenous plant. In fact, according to Dr. Royle,[823]\r\nthe species has been naturalized in several parts of India; but he only\r\nsaw it apparently growing wild on the side of the mountain near the fort\r\nof Adjeegurh in Bundlecund, among teak trees. When so remarkable a tree,\r\nin a country so thoroughly explored by botanists, has only been\r\ndiscovered in a single locality beyond the limits of cultivation, it is\r\nmost probable that it is not indigenous in the country. Sir Joseph\r\nHooker found it in the isle of St. Iago, of the Cape Verde group,\r\nforming woods on the hills which overlook the valley of St.\r\nDomingo.[824] Since _A. squamosa_ is only known as a cultivated plant on\r\nthe neighbouring continent;[825] as it is not even indicated in Guinea\r\nby Thonning,[826] nor in Congo,[827] nor in Senegambia,[828] nor in\r\nAbyssinia and Egypt, which proves a recent introduction into Africa;\r\nlastly, as the Cape Verde Isles have lost a great part of their\r\nprimitive forests, I believe that this is a case of naturalization from\r\nseed escaped from gardens. Authors are agreed in considering the species\r\nwild in Jamaica. Formerly the assertions of Sloane[829] and Brown[830]\r\nmight have been disregarded, but they are confirmed by Macfadyen.[831]\r\nMartius found the species wild in the virgin forests of Para.[832] He\r\neven says, ‘_Sylvescentem in nemoribus paraensibus inveni_,’ whence it\r\nmay be inferred that these trees alone formed a forest.\r\nSplitgerber[833] found it in the forests of Surinam, but he says, ‘_An\r\nspontanea_?’ The number of localities in this part of America is\r\nsignificant. I need not remind my readers that no tree growing elsewhere\r\nthan on the coast has been found truly indigenous at once in tropical\r\nAsia, Africa, and America.[834] The result of my researches renders such\r\na fact almost impossible, and if a tree were robust enough to extend\r\nover such an area, it would be extremely common in all tropical\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, historical and philological facts tend also to confirm the\r\ntheory of an American origin. The details given by Rumphius[835] show\r\nthat _Anona squamosa_ was a plant newly cultivated in most of the\r\nislands of the Malay Archipelago. Forster does not mention the\r\ncultivation of any Anonacea in the small islands of the Pacific.[836]\r\nRheede[837] says that _A. squamosa_ is an exotic in Malabar, but was\r\nbrought to India, first by the Chinese and the Arabs, afterwards by the\r\nPortuguese. It is certainly cultivated in China and in\r\nCochin-China,[838] and in the Philippine Isles,[839] but we do not know\r\nfrom what epoch. It is doubtful whether the Arabs cultivate it.[840] It\r\nwas cultivated in India in Roxburgh’s day;[841] he had not seen the wild\r\nplant, and only mentions one common name in a modern language, the\r\nBengali _ata_, which is already in Rheede. Later the name\r\n_gunda-gatra_[842] was believed to be Sanskrit, but Dr. Royle[843]\r\nhaving consulted Wilson, the famous author of the Sanskrit dictionary,\r\ntouching the antiquity of this name, he replied that it was taken from\r\nthe _Sabda Chanrika_, a comparatively modern compilation. The names of\r\n_ata_, _ati_, are found in Rheede and Rumphius.[844] This is doubtless\r\nthe foundation of Saint-Hilaire’s argument; but a nearly similar name is\r\ngiven to _Anona squamosa_ in Mexico. This name is _ate_, _ahate di\r\nPanucho_, found in Hernandez[845] with two similar and rather poor\r\nfigures which may be attributed either to _A. squamosa_, as Dunal[846]\r\nthinks, or to _A. cherimolia_, according to Martius.[847] Oviedo uses\r\nthe name _anon_.[848] It is very possible that the name _ata_ was\r\nintroduced into Brazil from Mexico and the neighbouring countries. It\r\nmay also, I confess, have come from the Portuguese colonies in the East\r\nIndies. Martius says, however, that the species was imported from the\r\nWest India Islands.[849] I do not know whether he had any proof of this,\r\nor whether he speaks on the authority of Oviedo’s work, which he quotes\r\nand which I cannot consult. Oviedo’s article, translated by\r\nMarcgraf,[850] describes _A. squamosa_ without speaking of its origin.\r\n\r\n“The sum total of the facts is altogether in favour of an American\r\norigin. The locality where the species usually appears wild is in the\r\nforests of Para. Its cultivation is ancient in America, since Oviedo is\r\none of the first authors (1535) who has written about this country. No\r\ndoubt its cultivation is of ancient date in Asia likewise, and this\r\nrenders the problem curious. It is not proved, however, that it was\r\nanterior to the discovery of America, and it seems to me that a tree of\r\nwhich the fruit is so agreeable would have been more widely diffused in\r\nthe old world if it had always existed there. Moreover, it would be\r\ndifficult to explain its cultivation in America in the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century, on the hypothesis of an origin in the old world.”\r\n\r\nSince I wrote the above, I find the following facts published by\r\ndifferent authors:—\r\n\r\n1. The argument drawn from the fact that there is no Asiatic species of\r\nthe genus Anona is stronger than ever. _A. Asiatica_, Linnæus, was based\r\nupon errors (see my note in the _Géogr. Bot._, p. 862). _A. obtusifolia_\r\n(Tussac, _Fl. des Antilles_, i. p. 191, pl. 28), cultivated formerly in\r\nSt. Domingo as of Asiatic origin, is also perhaps founded upon a\r\nmistake. I suspect that the drawing represents the flower of one species\r\n(_A. muricata_) and the fruit of another (_A. squamosa_). No Anona has\r\nbeen discovered in Asia, but four or five are now known in Africa\r\ninstead of only one or two,[851] and a larger number than formerly in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n2. The authors of recent Asiatic floras do not hesitate to consider the\r\nAnonæ, particularly _A. squamosa_, which is here and there found\r\napparently wild, as naturalized in the neighbourhood of cultivated\r\nground and of European settlements.[852]\r\n\r\n3. In the new African floras already quoted, _A. squamosa_ and the\r\nothers of which I shall speak presently are always mentioned as\r\ncultivated species.\r\n\r\n4. McNab, the horticulturist, found _A. squamosa_ in the dry plains of\r\nJamaica,[853] which confirms the assertions of previous authors. Eggers\r\nsays[854] that the species is common in the thickets of Santa Cruz and\r\nVirgin Islands. I do not find that it has been discovered wild in Cuba.\r\n\r\n5. On the American continent it is given as cultivated.[855] However, M.\r\nAndré sent me a specimen from a stony district in the Magdalena valley,\r\nwhich appears to belong to this species and to be wild. The fruit is\r\nwanting, which renders the matter doubtful. From the note on the ticket,\r\nit is a delicious fruit like that of _A. squamosa_. Warming[856]\r\nmentions the species as cultivated at Lagoa Santa in Brazil. It appears,\r\ntherefore, to be cultivated or naturalized from cultivation in Para,\r\nGuiana, and New Granada.\r\n\r\nIn fine, it can hardly be doubted, in my opinion, that its original\r\ncountry is America, and in especial the West India Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Sour Sop+—_Anona muricata_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis fruit-tree,[857] introduced into all the colonies in tropical\r\ncountries is wild in the West Indies; at least, its existence has been\r\nproved in the islands of Cuba, St. Domingo, Jamaica, and several of the\r\nsmaller islands.[858] It is sometimes naturalized on the continent of\r\nSouth America near dwellings.[859] André brought specimens from the\r\ndistrict of Cauca in New Granada, but he does not say they were wild,\r\nand I see that Triana (_Prodr. Fl. Granat._) only mentions it as\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Custard Apple+ in the West Indies, +Bullock’s Heart+ in the East\r\nIndies—_Anona reticulata_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis Anona, figured in Descourtilz, _Flore Médicale des Antilles_, ii.\r\npl. 82, and in the _Botanical Magazine_, pl. 2912, is wild in Cuba,\r\nJamaica, St. Vincent, Guadeloupe, Santa Cruz, and Barbados,[860] and\r\nalso in the island of Tobago in the Bay of Panama,[861] and in the\r\nprovince of Antioquia in New Granada.[862] If it is wild in the\r\nlast-named localities as well as in the West Indies, its area probably\r\nextends into several states of Central America and of New Granada.\r\n\r\nAlthough the bullock’s heart is not much esteemed as a fruit, the\r\nspecies has been introduced into most tropical colonies. Rheede and\r\nRumphius found it in plantations in Southern Asia. According to\r\nWelwitsch, it has naturalized itself from cultivation in Angola, in\r\nWestern Africa,[863] and this has also taken place in British\r\nIndia.[864]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Chirimoya+—_Anona Cherimolia_, Lamarck.\r\n\r\nThe chirimoya is not so generally cultivated in the colonies as the\r\npreceding species, although the fruit is excellent. This is probably the\r\nreason that there is no illustration of the fruit better than that of\r\nFeuillée (_Obs._, iii. pl. 17), while the flower is well represented in\r\npl. 2011 of the _Botanical Magazine_, under the name of _A. tripetala_.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, I wrote as follows, touching the origin of the species:[865]\r\n“The chirimoya is mentioned by Lamarck and Dunal as growing in Peru; but\r\nFeuillée, who was the first to speak of it,[866] says that it is\r\ncultivated. Macfadyen[867] says it abounds in the Port Royal Mountains,\r\nJamaica; but he adds that it came originally from Peru, and must have\r\nbeen introduced long ago, whence it appears that the species is\r\ncultivated in the higher plantations, rather than wild. Sloane does not\r\nmention it. Humboldt and Bonpland saw it cultivated in Venezuela and New\r\nGranada; Martius in Brazil,[868] where the seeds had been introduced\r\nfrom Peru. The species is cultivated in the Cape Verde Islands, and on\r\nthe coast of Guinea,[869] but it does not appear to have been introduced\r\ninto Asia. Its American origin is evident. I might even go further, and\r\nassert that it is a native of Peru, rather than of New Granada or\r\nMexico. It will probably be found wild in one of these countries. Meyen\r\nhas not brought it from Peru.”[870]\r\n\r\nMy doubts are now lessened, thanks to a kind communication from M. Ed.\r\nAndré. I may mention first, that I have seen specimens from Mexico\r\ngathered by Botteri and Bourgeau, and that authors often speak of\r\nfinding the species in this region, in the West Indies, in Central\r\nAmerica, and New Granada. It is true, they do not say that it is wild.\r\nOn the contrary, they remark that it is cultivated, or that it has\r\nescaped from gardens and become naturalized.[871] Grisebach asserts that\r\nit is wild from Peru to Mexico, but he gives no proof. André gathered,\r\nin a valley in the south-west of Ecuador, specimens which certainly\r\nbelong to the species as far as it can be asserted without seeing the\r\nfruit. He says nothing as to its wild nature, but the care with which he\r\npoints out in other cases plants cultivated or perhaps escaped from\r\ncultivation, leads me to think that he regards these specimens as wild.\r\nClaude Gay says that the species has been cultivated in Chili from time\r\nimmemorial.[872] However, Molina, who mentions several fruit-trees in\r\nthe ancient plantations of the country, does not speak of it.[873]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I consider it most probable that the species is\r\nindigenous in Ecuador, and perhaps in the neighbouring part of Peru.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Oranges and Lemons+—_Citrus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of citrons, lemons, oranges, shaddocks, etc.,\r\ncultivated in gardens have been the subject of remarkable works by\r\nseveral horticulturists, among which Gallesio and Risso[874] hold the\r\nfirst rank. The difficulty of observing and classifying so many\r\nvarieties was very great. Fair results have been obtained, but it must\r\nbe owned that the method was wrong from the beginning, since the plants\r\nfrom which the observations were taken were all cultivated, that is to\r\nsay, more or less artificial, and perhaps in some cases hybrids.\r\nBotanists are now more fortunate. Thanks to the discoveries of\r\ntravellers in British India, they are able to distinguish the wild and\r\ntherefore the true and natural species. According to Sir Joseph\r\nHooker,[875] who was himself a collector in India, the work of\r\nBrandis[876] is the best on the _Citrus_ of this region, and he follows\r\nit in his flora. I shall do likewise in default of a monograph of the\r\ngenus, remarking also that the multitude of garden varieties which have\r\nbeen described and figured for centuries, ought to be identified as far\r\nas possible with the wild species.[877]\r\n\r\nThe same species, and perhaps others also, probably grow wild in\r\nCochin-China and in China; but this has not been proved in the country\r\nitself, nor by means of specimens examined by botanists. Perhaps the\r\nimportant works of Pierre, now in course of publication, will give\r\ninformation on this head for Cochin-China. With regard to China, I will\r\nquote the following passage from Dr. Bretschneider,[878] which is\r\ninteresting from the special knowledge of the writer:—“Oranges, of which\r\nthere are a great variety in China, are counted by the Chinese among\r\ntheir wild fruits. It cannot be doubted that most of them are\r\nindigenous, and have been cultivated from very early times. The proof of\r\nthis is that each species or variety bears a distinct name, besides\r\nbeing in most cases represented by a particular character, and is\r\nmentioned in the _Shu-king, Rh-ya_, and other ancient works.”\r\n\r\nMen and birds disperse the seeds of Aurantiaceæ, whence results the\r\nextension of its area, and its naturalization in all the warm regions of\r\nthe two worlds. It was observed[879] in America from the first century\r\nafter the conquest, and now groves of orange trees have sprung up even\r\nin the south of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Shaddock+—_Citrus decumana_, Willdenow.\r\n\r\nI take this species first, because its botanical character is more\r\nmarked than that of the others. It is a larger tree, and this species\r\nalone has down on the young shoots and the under sides of the leaves.\r\nThe fruit is spherical, or nearly spherical, larger than an orange,\r\nsometimes even as large as a man’s head. The juice is slightly acid, the\r\nrind remarkably thick. Good illustrations of the fruit may be seen in\r\nDuhamel, _Traité des Arbres_, edit. 2, vii. pl. 42, and in Tussac,\r\n_Flore des Antilles_, iii. pls. 17, 18. The number of varieties in the\r\nMalay Archipelago indicates an ancient cultivation. Its original country\r\nis not yet accurately known, because the trees which appear indigenous\r\nmay be the result of naturalization, following frequent cultivation.\r\nRoxburgh says that the species was brought to Calcutta from Java,[880]\r\nand Rumphius[881] believed it to be a native of Southern China.\r\nNeither he nor modern botanists saw it wild in the Malay\r\nArchipelago.[882] In China the species has a simple name, _yu_; but its\r\nwritten character[883] appears too complicated for a truly indigenous\r\nplant. According to Loureiro, the tree is common in China and\r\nCochin-China, but this does not imply that it is wild.[884] It is in the\r\nislands to the east of the Malay Archipelago that the clearest\r\nindications of a wild existence are found. Forster[885] formerly said of\r\nthis species, “very common in the Friendly Isles.” Seemann[886] is yet\r\nmore positive about the Fiji Isles. “Extremely common,” he says, “and\r\ncovering the banks of the rivers.”\r\n\r\nIt would be strange if a tree, so much cultivated in the south of Asia,\r\nshould have become naturalized to such a degree in certain islands of\r\nthe Pacific, while it has scarcely been seen elsewhere. It is probably\r\nindigenous to them, and may perhaps yet be discovered wild in some\r\nislands nearer to Java.\r\n\r\nThe French name, _pompelmouse_, is from the Dutch _pompelmoes_. Shaddock\r\nwas the name of a captain who first introduced the species into the West\r\nIndies.[887]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Citron, Lemon+—_Citrus medica_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis tree, like the common orange, is glabrous in all its parts. Its\r\nfruit, longer than it is wide, is surmounted in most of its varieties by\r\na sort of nipple. The juice is more or less acid. The young shoots and\r\nthe petals are frequently tinted red. The rind of the fruit is often\r\nrough, and very thick in some sub-varieties.[888]\r\n\r\nBrandis and Sir Joseph Hooker distinguish four cultivated varieties:—\r\n\r\n1. _Citrus medica proper_ (_citron_ in English, _cedratier_ in French,\r\n_cedro_ in Italian), with large, not spherical fruit, whose highly\r\naromatic rind is covered with lumps, and of which the juice is neither\r\nabundant nor very acid. According to Brandis, it was called _vijapûra_\r\nin Sanskrit.\r\n\r\n2. _Citrus medica Limonum_ (_citronnier_ in French, _lemon_ in English).\r\nFruit of average size, not spherical, and abundant acid juice.\r\n\r\n3. _Citrus medica acida_ (_C. acida_, Roxburgh). Lime in English. Small\r\nflowers, fruit small and variable in shape, juice very acid. According\r\nto Brandis, the Sanskrit name was _jambira_.\r\n\r\n4. _Citrus medica Limetta_ (_C. Limetta_ and _C. Lumia_ of Risso), with\r\nflowers like those of the preceding variety, but with spherical fruit\r\nand sweet, non-aromatic juice. In India it is called the _sweet lime_.\r\n\r\nThe botanist Wight affirms that this last variety is wild in the\r\nNilgherry Hills. Other forms, which answer more or less exactly to the\r\nthree other varieties, have been found wild by several Anglo-Indian\r\nbotanists[889] in the warm districts at the foot of the Himalayas, from\r\nGarwal to Sikkim, in the south-east at Chittagong and in Burmah, and in\r\nthe south-west in the western Ghauts and the Satpura Mountains. From\r\nthis it cannot be doubted that the species is indigenous in India, and\r\neven under different forms of prehistoric antiquity.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether its area includes China or the Malay Archipelago.\r\nLoureiro mentions _Citrus medica_ in Cochin-China only as a cultivated\r\nplant, and Bretschneider tells us that the lemon has Chinese names which\r\ndo not exist in the ancient writings, and for which the written\r\ncharacters are complicated, indications of a foreign species. It may, he\r\nsays, have been introduced. In Japan the species is only a cultivated\r\none.[890] Lastly, several of Rumphius’ illustrations show varieties\r\ncultivated in the Sunda Islands, but none of these are considered by the\r\nauthor as really wild and indigenous to the country. To indicate the\r\nlocality, he sometimes used the expression “_in hortis sylvestribus_,”\r\nwhich might be translated shrubberies. Speaking of his _Lemon sussu_\r\n(vol. ii. pl. 25), which is a _Citrus medica_ with ellipsoidal acid\r\nfruit, he says it has been introduced into Amboyna, but that it is\r\ncommoner in Java, “usually in forests.” This may be the result of an\r\naccidental naturalization from cultivation. Miquel, in his modern flora\r\nof the Dutch Indies,[891] does not hesitate to say that _Citrus medica_\r\nand _C. Limonum_ are only cultivated in the archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of more or less acid varieties spread into Western Asia\r\nat an early date, at least into Mesopotamia and Media. This can hardly\r\nbe doubted, for two varieties had Sanskrit names; and, moreover, the\r\nGreeks knew the fruit through the Medes, whence the name _Citrus\r\nmedica_. Theophrastus[892] was the first to speak of it under the name\r\nof apple of Media and of Persia, in a phrase often repeated and\r\ncommented on in the last two centuries.[893] It evidently applies to\r\n_Citrus medica_; but while he explains how the seed is first sown in\r\nvases, to be afterwards transplanted, the author does not say whether\r\nthis was the Greek custom, or whether he was describing the practice of\r\nthe Medes. Probably the citron was not then cultivated in Greece, for\r\nthe Romans did not grow it in their gardens at the beginning of the\r\nChristian era.\r\n\r\nDioscorides,[894] born in Cilicia, and who wrote in the first century,\r\nspeaks of it in almost the same terms as Theophrastus. It is supposed\r\nthat the species was, after many attempts,[895] cultivated in Italy in\r\nthe third or fourth century. Palladius, in the fifth century, speaks of\r\nit as well established.\r\n\r\nThe ignorance of the Romans of the classic period touching foreign\r\nplants has caused them to confound, under the name of _lignum citreum_,\r\nthe wood of _Citrus_, with that of _Cedrus_, of which fine tables were\r\nmade, and which was a cedar, or a _Thuya_, of the totally different\r\nfamily of Coniferæ.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrews must have known the citron before the Romans, because of\r\ntheir frequent relations with Persia, Media and the adjacent countries.\r\nThe custom of the modern Jews of presenting themselves at the synagogue\r\non the day of the Feast of Tabernacles, with a citron in their hand,\r\ngave rise to the belief that the word _hadar_ in Leviticus signified\r\nlemon or citron; but Risso has shown, by comparing the ancient texts,\r\nthat it signifies a fine fruit, or the fruit of a fine tree. He even\r\nthinks that the Hebrews did not know the citron or lemon at the\r\nbeginning of our era, because the Septuagint Version translates _hadar_\r\nby fruit of a fine tree. Nevertheless, as the Greeks had seen the citron\r\nin Media and in Persia in the time of Theophrastus, three centuries\r\nbefore Christ, it would be strange if the Hebrews had not become\r\nacquainted with it at the time of the Babylonish Captivity. Besides, the\r\nhistorian Josephus says that in his time the Jews bore Persian apples,\r\n_malum persicum_, at their feasts, one of the Greek names for the\r\ncitron.\r\n\r\nThe varieties with very acid fruit, like _Limonum_ and _acida_, did not\r\nperhaps attract attention so early as the citron, however the strongly\r\naromatic odour mentioned by Dioscorides and Theophrastus appears to\r\nindicate them. The Arabs extended the cultivation of the lemon in Africa\r\nand Europe. According to Gallesio, they transported it, in the tenth\r\ncentury of our era, from the gardens of Oman into Palestine and Egypt.\r\nJacques de Vitry, in the thirteenth century, well described the lemon\r\nwhich he had seen in Palestine. An author named Falcando mentions in\r\n1260 some very acid “_lumias_” which were cultivated near Palermo, and\r\nTuscany had them also towards the same period.[896]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Orange+—_Citrus Aurantium_, Linnæus (excl. var. γ); _Citrus\r\nAurantium_, Risso.\r\n\r\nOranges are distinguished from shaddocks (_C. decumana_) by the complete\r\nabsence of down on the young shoots and leaves, by their smaller fruit,\r\nalways spherical, and by a thinner rind. They differ from lemons and\r\ncitrons in their pure white flowers; in the fruit, which is never\r\nelongated, and without a nipple on the summit; in the rind, smooth or\r\nnearly so, and adhering but lightly to the pulp.\r\n\r\nNeither Risso, in his excellent monograph of _Citrus_, nor modern\r\nauthors, as Brandis and Sir Joseph Hooker, have been able to discover\r\nany other character than the taste to distinguish the sweet orange from\r\nmore or less bitter fruits. This difference appeared to me of such\r\nslight importance from the botanical point of view, when I studied the\r\nquestion of origin in 1855, that I was inclined, with Risso, to consider\r\nthese two sorts of orange as simple varieties. Modern Anglo-Indian\r\nauthors do the same. They add a third variety, which they call\r\n_Bergamia_, for the bergamot orange, of which the flower is smaller, and\r\nthe fruit spherical or pyriform, and smaller than the common orange,\r\naromatic and slightly acid. This last form has not been found wild, and\r\nappears to me to be rather a product of cultivation.\r\n\r\nIt is often asked whether the seeds of sweet oranges yield sweet\r\noranges, and of bitter, bitter oranges. It matters little from the point\r\nof view of the distinction into species or varieties, for we know that\r\nboth in the animal and vegetable kingdoms all characters are more or\r\nless hereditary, that certain varieties are habitually so, to such a\r\ndegree that they should be called races, and that the distinction into\r\nspecies must consequently be founded upon other considerations, such as\r\nthe absence of intermediate forms, or the failure of crossed\r\nfertilization to produce fertile hybrids. However, the question is not\r\ndevoid of interest in the present case, and I must answer that\r\nexperiments have given results which are at times contradictory.\r\n\r\nGallesio, an excellent observer, expresses himself as follows:—“I have\r\nduring a long series of years sown pips of sweet oranges, taken\r\nsometimes from the natural tree, sometimes from oranges grafted on\r\nbitter orange trees or lemon trees. The result has always been trees\r\nbearing sweet fruit; and the same has been observed for more than sixty\r\nyears by all the gardeners of Finale. There is no instance of a bitter\r\norange tree from seed of sweet oranges, nor of a sweet orange tree from\r\nthe seed of bitter oranges.... In 1709, the orange trees of Finale\r\nhaving been killed by frost, the practice of raising sweet orange trees\r\nfrom seed was introduced, and every one of these plants produced the\r\nsweet-juiced fruit.”[897]\r\n\r\nMacfadyen,[898] on the contrary, in his _Flora of Jamaica_, says, “It is\r\na well-established fact, familiar to every one who has been any length\r\nof time in this island, that the seed of the sweet orange very\r\nfrequently grows up into a tree bearing the bitter fruit, numerous\r\nwell-attested instances of which have come to my own knowledge. I am not\r\naware, however, that the seed of the bitter orange has ever grown up\r\ninto the sweet-fruited variety.... We may therefore conclude,” the\r\nauthor judiciously goes on to say, “that the bitter orange was the\r\noriginal stock.” He asserts that in calcareous soil the sweet orange may\r\nbe raised from seed, but that in other soils it produces fruits more or\r\nless sour or bitter. Duchassaing says that in Guadeloupe the seeds of\r\nsweet oranges often yield bitter fruit,[899] while, according to Dr.\r\nErnst, at Caracas they sometimes yield sour but not bitter fruit.[900]\r\nBrandis relates that at Khasia, in India, as far as he can verify the\r\nfact, the extensive plantations of sweet oranges are from seed. These\r\ndifferences show the variable degree of heredity, and confirm the\r\nopinion that these two kinds of orange should be considered as two\r\nvarieties, not two species.\r\n\r\nI am, however, obliged to take them in succession, to explain their\r\norigin and the extent of their cultivation at different epochs.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Bitter Orange+—_Arancio forte_ in Italian, _bigaradier_ in French,\r\n_pomeranze_ in German. _Citrus vulgaris_, Risso; _C. aurantium_ (var.\r\n_bigaradia_), Brandis and Hooker.\r\n\r\nIt was unknown to the Greeks and Romans, as well as the sweet orange. As\r\nthey had had communication with India and Ceylon, Gallesio supposed that\r\nthese trees were not cultivated in their time in the west of India. He\r\nhad studied from this point of view, ancient travellers and geographers,\r\nsuch as Diodorus Siculus, Nearchus, Arianus, and he finds no mention of\r\nthe orange in them. However, there was a Sanskrit name for the\r\norange—_nagarunga_, _nagrunga_.[901] It is from this that the word\r\norange came, for the Hindus turned it into _narungee_ (pron.\r\n_naroudji_), according to Royle, _nerunga_ according to Piddington; the\r\nArabs into _narunj_, according to Gallesio, the Italians into _naranzi_,\r\n_arangi_, and in the mediæval Latin it was _arancium_, _arangium_,\r\nafterwards _aurantium_.[902] But did the Sanskrit name apply to the\r\nbitter or to the sweet orange? The philologist Adolphe Pictet formerly\r\ngave me some curious information on this head. He had sought in Sanskrit\r\nworks the descriptive names given to the orange or to the tree, and had\r\nfound seventeen, which all allude to the colour, the odour, its acid\r\nnature (_danta catha_, harmful to the teeth), the place of growth, etc.,\r\nnever to a sweet or agreeable taste. This multitude of names similar to\r\nepithets show that the fruit had long been known, but that its taste was\r\nvery different to that of the sweet orange. Besides, the Arabs, who\r\ncarried the orange tree with them towards the West, were first\r\nacquainted with the bitter orange, and gave it the name _narunj_,[903]\r\nand their physicians from the tenth century prescribed the bitter juice\r\nof this fruit.[904] The exhaustive researches of Gallesio show that\r\nafter the fall of the Empire the species advanced from the coast of the\r\nPersian Gulf, and by the end of the ninth century had reached Arabia,\r\nthrough Oman, Bassora, Irak, and Syria, according to the Arabian author\r\nMassoudi. The Crusaders saw the bitter orange tree in Palestine. It was\r\ncultivated in Sicily from the year 1002, probably a result of the\r\nincursions of the Arabs. It was they who introduced it into Spain, and\r\nmost likely also into the east of Africa. The Portuguese found it on\r\nthat coast when they doubled the Cape in 1498.[905] There is no ground\r\nfor supposing that either the bitter or the sweet orange existed in\r\nAfrica before the Middle Ages, for the myth of the garden of Hesperides\r\nmay refer to any species of the order _Aurantiaceæ_, and its site is\r\naltogether arbitrary, since the imagination of the ancients was\r\nwonderfully fertile.\r\n\r\nThe early Anglo-Indian botanists, such as Roxburgh, Royle, Griffith,\r\nWight, had not come across the bitter orange wild; but there is every\r\nprobability that the eastern region of India was its original country.\r\nWallich mentions Silhet,[906] but without asserting that the species was\r\nwild in this locality. Later, Sir Joseph Hooker[907] saw the bitter\r\norange certainly wild in several districts to the south of the\r\nHimalayas, from Garwal and Sikkim as far as Khasia. The fruit was\r\nspherical or slightly flattened, two inches in diameter, bright in\r\ncolour, and uneatable, of mawkish and bitter taste (“if I remember\r\nright,” says the author). _Citrus fusca_, Loureiro,[908] similar, he\r\nsays, to pl. 23 of Rumphius, and wild in Cochin-China and China, may\r\nvery likely be the bitter orange whose area extends to the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Sweet Orange+—Italian, _Arancio dolce_; German, _Apfelsine_. _Citrus\r\nAurantium sinense_, Gallesio.\r\n\r\nRoyle[909] says that sweet oranges grow wild at Silhet and in the\r\nNilgherry Hills, but his assertion is not accompanied with sufficient\r\ndetail to give it importance. According to the same author, Turner’s\r\nexpedition gathered “delicious” wild oranges at Buxedwar, a locality to\r\nthe north-east of Rungpoor, in the province of Bengal. On the other\r\nhand, Brandis and Sir Joseph Hooker do not mention the sweet orange as\r\nwild in British India; they only give it as cultivated. Kurz does not\r\nmention it in his forest flora of British Burmah. Further east, in\r\nCochin-China, Loureiro[910] describes a _C. Aurantium_, with\r\nbitter-sweet (_acido-dulcis_) pulp, which appears to be the sweet\r\norange, and which is found both wild and cultivated in China and\r\nCochin-China. Chinese authors consider orange trees in general as\r\nnatives of their country, but precise information about each species and\r\nvariety is wanting on this head.\r\n\r\nFrom the collected facts, it seems that the sweet orange is a native of\r\nSouthern China and of Cochin-China, with a doubtful and accidental\r\nextension of area by seed into India.\r\n\r\nBy seeking in what country it was first cultivated, and how it was\r\npropagated, some light may be thrown upon the origin, and upon the\r\ndistinction between the bitter and sweet orange. So large a fruit, and\r\none so agreeable to the palate as the sweet orange, can hardly have\r\nexisted in any district, without some attempts having been made to\r\ncultivate it. It is easily raised from seed, and nearly always produces\r\nthe wished-for quality. Neither can ancient travellers and historians\r\nhave neglected to notice the introduction of so remarkable a fruit tree.\r\nOn this historical point Gallesio’s study of ancient authors has\r\nproduced extremely interesting results.\r\n\r\nHe first proves that the orange trees brought from India by the Arabs\r\ninto Palestine, Egypt, the south of Europe, and the east coast of\r\nAfrica, were not the sweet-fruited tree. Up to the fifteenth century,\r\nArab books and chronicles only mention bitter, or sour oranges. However,\r\nwhen the Portuguese arrived in the islands of Southern Asia, they found\r\nthe sweet orange, and apparently it had not previously been unknown to\r\nthem. The Florentine who accompanied Vasco de Gama, and who published an\r\naccount of the voyage, says, “_Sonvi melarancie assai, ma tutte dolci_”\r\n(there are plenty of oranges, but all sweet.) Neither this writer nor\r\nsubsequent travellers expressed surprise at the pleasant taste of the\r\nfruit. Hence Gallesio infers that the Portuguese were not the first to\r\nbring the sweet orange from India, which they reached in 1498, nor from\r\nChina, which they reached in 1518. Besides, a number of writers in the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century speak of the sweet orange as a fruit\r\nalready cultivated in Spain and Italy. There are several testimonies for\r\nthe years 1523, and 1525. Gallesio goes no further than the idea that\r\nthe sweet orange was introduced into Europe towards the beginning of the\r\nfifteenth century;[911] but Targioni quotes from Valeriani a statute of\r\nFermo, of the fourteenth century, referring to citrons, sweet oranges,\r\netc.;[912] and the information recently collected from early authors by\r\nGoeze,[913] about the introduction into Spain and Portugal, agrees with\r\nthis date. It therefore appears to me probable that the oranges imported\r\nlater from China by the Portuguese were only of better quality than\r\nthose already known in Europe, and that the common expressions, Portugal\r\nand Lisbon oranges, are due to this circumstance.\r\n\r\nIf the sweet orange had been cultivated at a very early date in India,\r\nit would have had a special name in Sanskrit; the Greeks would have\r\nknown it after Alexander’s expedition, and the Hebrews would have early\r\nreceived it through Mesopotamia. This fruit would certainly have been\r\nvalued, cultivated, and propagated in the Roman empire, in preference to\r\nthe lemon, citron, and bitter orange. Its existence in India must,\r\ntherefore, be less ancient.\r\n\r\nIn the Malay Archipelago the sweet orange was believed to come from\r\nChina.[914] It was but little diffused in the Pacific Isles at the time\r\nof Cook’s voyages.[915]\r\n\r\nWe come back thus by all sorts of ways to the idea that the sweet\r\nvariety of the orange came from China and Cochin-China, and that it\r\nspread into India perhaps towards the beginning of the Christian era. It\r\nmay have become naturalized from cultivation in many parts of India and\r\nin all tropical countries, but we have seen that the seed does not\r\nalways yield trees bearing sweet fruit. This defect in heredity in\r\ncertain cases is in support of the theory that the sweet orange was\r\nderived from the bitter, at some remote epoch, in China or Cochin-China,\r\nand has since been carefully propagated on account of its horticultural\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Mandarin+—_Citrus nobilis_, Loureiro.\r\n\r\nThis species, characterized by its smaller fruit, uneven on the surface,\r\nspherical, but flattened at the top, and of a peculiar flavour, is now\r\nprized in Europe as it has been from the earliest times in China and\r\nCochin-China. The Chinese call it _kan_.[916] Rumphius had seen it\r\ncultivated in all the Sunda Islands,[917] and says that it was\r\nintroduced thither from China, but it had not spread into India.\r\nRoxburgh and Sir Joseph Hooker do not mention it, but Clarke informs me\r\nthat its culture has been greatly extended in the district of Khasia. It\r\nwas new to European gardens at the beginning of the present century,\r\nwhen Andrews published a good illustration of it in the _Botanist’s\r\nRepository_ (pl. 608).\r\n\r\nAccording to Loureiro,[918] this tree, of average size, grows in\r\nCochin-China, and also, he adds, in China, although he had not seen it\r\nin Canton. This is not very precise information as to its wild\r\ncharacter, but no other origin can be supposed. According to Kurz,[919]\r\nthe species is only cultivated in British Burmah. If this is confirmed,\r\nits area would be restricted to Cochin-China and a few provinces in\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Mangosteen+—_Garcinia mangostana_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThere is a good illustration in the _Botanical Magazine_, pl. 4847, of\r\nthis tree, belonging to the order Guttiferæ, of which the fruit is\r\nconsidered one of the best in existence. It demands a very hot climate,\r\nfor Roxburgh could not make it grow north of twenty-three and a half\r\ndegrees of latitude in India,[920] and, transported to Jamaica, it bears\r\nbut poor fruit.[921] It is cultivated in the Sunda Islands, in the Malay\r\nPeninsula, and in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe species is certainly wild in the forests of the Sunda Islands[922]\r\nand of the Malay Peninsula.[923] Among cultivated plants it is one of\r\nthe most local, both in its origin, habitation, and in cultivation. It\r\nbelongs, it is true, to one of those families in which the mean area of\r\nthe species is most restricted.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Mamey+, or +Mammee Apple+—_Mammea Americana_, Jacquin.\r\n\r\nThis tree, of the order Guttiferæ, requires, like the mangosteen, great\r\nheat. Although much cultivated in the West Indies and in the hottest\r\nparts of Venezuela,[924] its culture has seldom been attempted, or has\r\nmet with but little success, in Asia and Africa, if we are to judge by\r\nthe silence of most authors.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly indigenous in the forests of most of the West\r\nIndies.[925] Jacquin mentions it also for the neighbouring continent,\r\nbut I do not find this confirmed by modern authors. The best\r\nillustration is that in Tussac’s _Flore des Antilles_, iii. pl. 7, and\r\nthis author gives a number of details respecting the use of the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Ochro+, or +Gombo+—_Hibiscus esculentus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe young fruits of this annual, of the order of Malvaceæ, form one of\r\nthe most delicate of tropical vegetables. Tussac’s _Flore des Antilles_\r\ncontains a fine plate of the species, and gives all the details a\r\n_gourmet_ could desire on the manner of preparing the _caloulou_, so\r\nmuch esteemed by the creoles of the French colonies.\r\n\r\nWhen I formerly[926] tried to discover whence this plant, cultivated in\r\nthe old and new worlds, came originally, the absence of a Sanskrit name,\r\nand the fact that the first writers on the Indian flora had not seen it\r\nwild, led me to put aside the hypothesis of an Asiatic origin. However,\r\nas the modern flora of British India[927] mentions it as “probably of\r\nnative origin,” I was constrained to make further researches.\r\n\r\nAlthough Southern Asia has been thoroughly explored during the last\r\nthirty years, no locality is mentioned where the _Gombo_ is wild or half\r\nwild. There is no indication, even, of an ancient cultivation in Asia.\r\nThe doubt, therefore, lies between Africa and America. The plant has\r\nbeen seen wild in the West Indies by a good observer,[928] but I can\r\ndiscover no similar assertion on the part of any other botanist, either\r\nwith respect to the islands or to the American continent. The earliest\r\nwriter on Jamaica, Sloane, had only seen the species in a state of\r\ncultivation. Marcgraf[929] had observed it in Brazilian plantations, and\r\nas he mentions a name from the Congo and Angola country, _quillobo_,\r\nwhich the Portuguese corrupted into _quingombo_, the African origin is\r\nhereby indicated.\r\n\r\nSchweinfurth and Ascherson[930] saw the plant wild in the Nile Valley in\r\nNubia, Kordofan, Senaar, Abyssinia, and in the Baar-el-Abiad, where,\r\nindeed, it is cultivated. Other travellers are mentioned as having\r\ngathered specimens in Africa, but it is not specified whether these\r\nplants were cultivated or wild at a distance from habitations. We should\r\nstill be in doubt if Flückiger and Hanbury[931] had not made a\r\nbibliographical discovery which settles the question. The Arabs call the\r\nfruit _bamyah_, or _bâmiat_, and Abul-Abas-Elnabati, who visited Egypt\r\nlong before the discovery of America, in 1216, has distinctly described\r\nthe _gombo_ then cultivated by the Egyptians.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its undoubtedly African origin, it does not appear that the\r\nspecies was cultivated in Lower Egypt before the Arab rule. No proof has\r\nbeen found in ancient monuments, although Rosellini thought he\r\nrecognized the plant in a drawing, which differs widely from it\r\naccording to Unger.[932] The existence of one name in modern Indian\r\nlanguages, according to Piddington, confirms the idea of its propagation\r\ntowards the East after the beginning of the Christian era.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Vine+—_Vitis vinifera_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe vine grows wild in the temperate regions of Western Asia, Southern\r\nEurope, Algeria, and Marocco.[933] It is especially in the Pontus, in\r\nArmenia, to the south of the Caucasus and of the Caspian Sea, that it\r\ngrows with the luxuriant wildness of a tropical creeper, clinging to\r\ntall trees and producing abundant fruit without pruning or cultivation.\r\nIts vigorous growth is mentioned in ancient Bactriana, Cabul, Kashmir,\r\nand even in Badakkhan to the north of the Hindu Koosh.[934] Of course,\r\nit is a question whether the plants found there, as elsewhere, are not\r\nsprung from seeds carried from vineyards by birds. I notice, however,\r\nthat the most trustworthy botanists, those who have most thoroughly\r\nexplored the Transcaucasian provinces of Russia, do not hesitate to say\r\nthat the plant is wild and indigenous in this region. It is as we\r\nadvance towards India and Arabia, Europe and the north of Africa, that\r\nwe frequently find in floras the expression that the vine is\r\n“subspontaneous,” perhaps wild, or become wild (_verwildert_ is the\r\nexpressive German term).\r\n\r\nThe dissemination by birds must have begun very early, as soon as the\r\nfruit existed, before cultivation, before the migration of the most\r\nancient Asiatic peoples, perhaps before the existence of man in Europe\r\nor even in Asia. Nevertheless, the frequency of cultivation, and the\r\nmultitude of forms of the cultivated grape, may have extended\r\nnaturalization and introduced among wild vines varieties which\r\noriginated in cultivation. In fact, natural agents, such as birds,\r\nwinds, and currents, have always widened the area of species,\r\nindependently of man, as far as the limits imposed in each age by\r\ngeographical and physical conditions, together with the hostile action\r\nof other plants and animals, allow. An absolutely primitive habitation\r\nis more or less mythical, but habitations successively extended or\r\nrestricted are in accordance with the nature of things. They constitute\r\nareas more or less ancient and real, provided that the species has\r\nmaintained itself wild without the constant addition of fresh seed.\r\n\r\nConcerning the vine, we have proofs of its great antiquity in Europe as\r\nin Asia. Seeds of the grape have been found in the lake-dwellings of\r\nCastione, near Parma, which date from the age of bronze,[935] in a\r\nprehistoric settlement of Lake Varese,[936] and in the lake-dwellings of\r\nWangen, Switzerland, but in the latter instance at an uncertain\r\ndepth.[937] And, what is more, vine-leaves have been found in the tufa\r\nround Montpellier, where they were probably deposited before the\r\nhistorical epoch, and in the tufa of Meyrargue in Provence, which is\r\ncertainly prehistoric,[938] though later than the tertiary epoch of\r\ngeologists.[939]\r\n\r\nA Russian botanist, Kolenati,[940] has made some very interesting\r\nobservations on the different varieties of the vine, both wild and\r\ncultivated, in the country which may be called the central, and perhaps\r\nthe most ancient home of the species, the south of the Caucasus. I\r\nconsider his opinion the more important that the author has based his\r\nclassification of varieties with reference to the downy character and\r\nveining of the leaves, points absolutely indifferent to cultivators, and\r\nwhich consequently must far better represent the natural conditions of\r\nthe plant. He says that the wild vines, of which he had seen an immense\r\nquantity between the Black and Caspian Seas, may be grouped into two\r\nsub-species which he describes, and declares are recognizable at a\r\ndistance, and which are the point of departure of cultivated vines, at\r\nleast in Armenia and the neighbourhood. He recognized them near Mount\r\nArarat, at an altitude where the vine is not cultivated, where, indeed,\r\nit could not be cultivated. Other characters—for instance, the shape\r\nand colour of the grapes—vary in each of the sub-species. We cannot enter\r\nhere into the purely botanical details of Kolenati’s paper, any more\r\nthan into those of Regel’s more recent work on the genus _Vitis_;[941]\r\nbut it is well to note that a species cultivated from a very remote\r\nepoch, and which has perhaps two thousand described varieties, presents\r\nin the district where it is most ancient, and probably presented before\r\nall cultivation, at least two principal forms, with others of minor\r\nimportance. If the wild vines of Persia and Kashmir, of Lebanon and\r\nGreece, were observed with the same care, perhaps other sub-species of\r\nprehistoric antiquity might be found. The idea of collecting the juice\r\nof the grape and of allowing it to ferment may have occurred to\r\ndifferent peoples, principally in Western Asia, where the vine abounds\r\nand thrives. Adolphe Pictet,[942] who has, in common with numerous\r\nauthors, but in a more scientific manner, considered the historical,\r\nphilological, and even mythological questions relating to the vine among\r\nancient peoples, admits that both Semitic and Aryan nations knew the use\r\nof wine, so that they may have introduced it into all the countries into\r\nwhich they migrated, into India and Egypt and Europe. This they were the\r\nbetter able to do, since they found the vine wild in several of these\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThe records of the cultivation of the grape and of the making of wine in\r\nEgypt go back five or six thousand years.[943] In the West the\r\npropagation of its culture by the Phœnicians, Greeks, and Romans is\r\npretty well known, but to the east of Asia it took place at a late\r\nperiod. The Chinese who now cultivate the vine in their northern\r\nprovinces did not possess it earlier than the year 122 B.C.[944]\r\n\r\nIt is known that several wild vines exist in the north of China, but I\r\ncannot agree with M. Regel in considering _Vitis Amurensis_, Ruprecht,\r\nthe one most analogous to our vine, as identical in species. The seeds\r\ndrawn in the _Gartenflora_, 1861, pl. 33, differ too widely. If the\r\nfruit of these vines of Eastern Asia had any value, the Chinese would\r\ncertainly have turned them to account.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Common Jujube+—_Zizyphus vulgaris_, Lamarck.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pliny,[945] the jujube tree was brought from Syria to Rome\r\nby the consul Sextus Papinius, towards the end of the reign of Augustus.\r\nBotanists, however, have observed that the species is common in rocky\r\nplaces in Italy,[946] and that, moreover, it has not yet been found wild\r\nin Syria, although it is cultivated there, as in the whole region\r\nextending from the Mediterranean to China and Japan.[947]\r\n\r\nThe result of the search for the origin of the jujube tree as a wild\r\nplant bears out Pliny’s assertion, in spite of the objections I have\r\njust mentioned. According to plant collectors and authors of floras, the\r\nspecies appears to be more wild and more anciently cultivated in the\r\neast than in the west of its present wide area. Thus, in the north of\r\nChina, de Bunge says it is “very common and very troublesome (on account\r\nof its thorns) in mountainous places.” He had seen the thornless variety\r\nin gardens. Bretschneider[948] mentions the jujube as one of the fruits\r\nmost prized by the Chinese, who give it the simple name _tsao_. He also\r\nmentions the two varieties, with and without thorns, the former\r\nwild.[949] The species does not grow in the south of China and in India\r\nproper, because of the heat and moisture of the climate. It is found\r\nagain wild in the Punjab, in Persia, and Armenia.\r\n\r\nBrandis[950] gives seven different names for the jujube tree (or for its\r\nvarieties) in modern Indian languages, but no Sanskrit name is known.\r\nThe species was therefore probably introduced into India from China, at\r\nno very distant epoch, and it must have escaped from cultivation and\r\nhave become wild in the dry provinces of the west. The Persian name is\r\n_anob_, the Arabic _unab_. No Hebrew name is known, a further sign that\r\nthe species is not very ancient in the west of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks do not mention the common jujube, but only another\r\nspecies, _Zizyphus lotus_. At least, such is the opinion of the critic\r\nand modern botanist, Lenz.[951] It must be confessed that the modern\r\nGreek name _pritzuphuia_ has no connection with the names formerly\r\nattributed in Theophrastus and Dioscorides to some Zizyphus, but is\r\nallied to the Latin name _zizyphus_ (fruit _zizyphum_) of Pliny, which\r\ndoes not occur in earlier authors, and seems to be rather of an Oriental\r\nthan of a Latin character. Heldreich[952] does not admit that the jujube\r\ntree is wild in Greece, and others say “naturalized, half-wild,” which\r\nconfirms the hypothesis of a recent introduction. The same arguments\r\napply to Italy. The species may have become naturalized there after the\r\nintroduction into gardens mentioned by Pliny.\r\n\r\nIn Algeria the jujube is only cultivated or half-wild.[953] So also in\r\nSpain. It is not mentioned in Marocco, nor in the Canary Isles, which\r\nargues no very ancient existence in the Mediterranean basin.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me probable, therefore, that the species is a native of\r\nthe north of China; that it was introduced and became naturalized in the\r\nwest of Asia after the epoch of the Sanskrit language, perhaps two\r\nthousand five hundred or three thousand years ago; that the Greeks and\r\nRomans became acquainted with it at the beginning of our era, and that\r\nthe latter carried it into Barbary and Spain, where it became partially\r\nnaturalized by the effect of cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Lotus Jujube+—_Zizyphus lotus_, Desfontaines.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of this jujube is not worthy of attention except from an\r\nhistorical point of view. It is said to have been the food of the\r\nlotus-eater, a people of the Lybian coast, of whom Herod and\r\nHerodotos[954] have given a more or less accurate account. The\r\ninhabitants of this country must have been very poor or very temperate,\r\nfor a berry the size of a small cherry, tasteless, or slightly sweet,\r\nwould not satisfy ordinary men. There is no proof that the lotus-eaters\r\ncultivated this little tree or shrub. They doubtless gathered the fruit\r\nin the open country, for the species is common in the north of Africa.\r\nOne edition of Theophrastus[955] asserts, however, that there were some\r\nspecies of lotus without stones, which would imply cultivation. They\r\nwere planted in gardens, as is still done in modern Egypt,[956] but it\r\ndoes not seem to have been a common custom even among the ancients.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, widely different opinions have been held touching the\r\nlotus of the lotus-eaters,[957] and it is needless to insist upon a\r\npoint so obscure, in which so much must be allowed for the imagination\r\nof a poet and for popular ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe jujube tree is now wild in dry places from Egypt to Marocco, in the\r\nsouth of Spain, Terracina, and the neighbourhood of Palermo.[958] In\r\nisolated Italian localities it has probably escaped from cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Indian Jujube+[959]—_Zizyphus jujube_, Lamarck; _ber_ among the Hindus\r\nand Anglo-Indians, _masson_ in the Mauritius.\r\n\r\nThis jujube is cultivated further south than the common kind, but its\r\narea is equally extensive. The fruit is sometimes like an unripe cherry,\r\nsometimes like an olive, as is shown in the plate published by Bouton in\r\nHooker’s _Journal of Botany_, i. pl. 140. The great number of known\r\nvarieties indicates an ancient cultivation. It extends at the present\r\nday from Southern China, the Malay Archipelago, and Queensland, through\r\nArabia and Egypt as far as Marocco, and even to Senegal, Guinea, and\r\nAngola.[960] It grows also in Mauritius, but it does not appear to have\r\nbeen introduced into America as yet, unless perhaps into Brazil, as it\r\nseems from a specimen in my herbarium.[961] The fruit is preferable to\r\nthe common jujube, according to some writers.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to know what was the habitation of the species before all\r\ncultivation, because the stones sow themselves readily and the plant\r\nbecomes naturalized outside gardens.[962] If we are guided by its\r\nabundance in a wild state, it would seem that Burmah and British India\r\nare its original abode. I have in my herbarium several specimens\r\ngathered by Wallich in the kingdom of Burmah, and Kurz has often seen it\r\nin the dry forests of that country, near Ava and Prome.[963] Beddone\r\nadmits the species to be wild in the forests of British India, but\r\nBrandis had only found it in the neighbourhood of native\r\nsettlements.[964] In the seventeenth century Rheede[965] described this\r\ntree as wild on the Malabar coast, and botanists of the sixteenth\r\ncentury had received it from Bengal. In support of an Indian origin, I\r\nmay mention the existence of three Sanskrit names, and of eleven other\r\nnames in modern Indian languages.[966]\r\n\r\nIt had been recently introduced into the eastern islands of the Amboyna\r\ngroup when Rumphius was living there,[967] and he says himself that it\r\nis an Indian species. It was perhaps originally in Sumatra and in other\r\nislands near to the Malay Peninsula. Ancient Chinese authors do not\r\nmention it; at least Bretschneider did not know of it. Its extension and\r\nnaturalization to the east of the continent of India appear, therefore,\r\nto have been recent.\r\n\r\nIts introduction into Arabia and Egypt appears to be of yet later date.\r\nNot only no ancient name is known, but Forskal, a hundred years ago, and\r\nDelile at the beginning of the present century, had not seen the\r\nspecies, of which Schweinfurth has recently spoken as cultivated. It\r\nmust have spread to Zanzibar from Asia, and by degrees across Africa or\r\nin European vessels as far as the west coast. This must have been quite\r\nrecently, as Robert Brown (_Bot. of Congo_) and Thonning did not see the\r\nspecies in Guinea.[968]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Cashew+—_Anacardium occidentale_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe most erroneous assertions about the origin of this species were\r\nformerly made,[969] and in spite of what I said on the subject in\r\n1855,[970] I find them occasionally reproduced.\r\n\r\nThe French name _Pommier d’acajou_ (mahogany apple tree) is as absurd as\r\nit is possible to be. It is a tree belonging to the order of\r\n_Terebintaceæ_ or _Anacardiaceæ_, very different from the Rosaceæ and\r\nthe Meliaceæ, to which the apple and the mahogany belong. The edible\r\npart is more like a pear than an apple, and botanically speaking is not\r\na fruit, but the receptacle or support of the fruit, which resembles a\r\nlarge bean. The two names, French and English, are both derived from a\r\nname given to it by the natives of Brazil, _acaju_, _acajaiba_, quoted\r\nby early travellers.[971] The species is certainly wild in the forests\r\nof tropical America, and indeed occupies a wide area in that region; it\r\nis found, for example, in Brazil, Guiana, the Isthmus of Panama, and the\r\nWest Indies.[972] Dr. Ernst[973] believes it is only indigenous in the\r\nbasin of the Amazon River, although he had seen it also in Cuba, Panama,\r\nEcuador, and New Granada. His opinion is founded upon the absence of all\r\nmention of the plant in Spanish authors of the time of the Conquest—a\r\nnegative proof, which establishes a mere probability.\r\n\r\nRheede and Rumphius had also indicated this plant in the south of Asia.\r\nThe former says it is common on the Malabar coast.[974] The existence of\r\nthe same tropical arborescent species in Asia and America was so little\r\nprobable, that it was at first suspected that there was a difference of\r\nspecies, or at least of variety; but this was not confirmed. Different\r\nhistorical and philological proofs have convinced me that its origin is\r\nnot Asiatic.[975] Moreover, Rumphius, who is always accurate, spoke of\r\nan ancient introduction by the Portuguese into the Malay Archipelago\r\nfrom America. The Malay name he gives, _cadju_, is American; that used\r\nat Amboyna means Portugal fruit, that of Macassar was taken from the\r\nresemblance of the fruit to that of the _jambosa_. Rumphius says that\r\nthe species was not widely diffused in the islands. Garcia ab Orto did\r\nnot find it at Goa in 1550, but Acosta afterwards saw it at Couchin, and\r\nthe Portuguese propagated it in India and the Malay Archipelago.\r\nAccording to Blume and Miquel, the species is only cultivated in Java.\r\nRheede, it is true, says it is abundant (_provenit ubique_) on the coast\r\nof Malabar, but he only quotes one name which seems to be Indian, _kapa\r\nmava_; all the others are derived from the American name. Piddington\r\ngives no Sanskrit name. Lastly, Anglo-Indian colonists, after some\r\nhesitation as to its origin, now admit the importation of the species\r\nfrom America at an early period. They add that it has become naturalized\r\nin the forests of British India.[976]\r\n\r\nIt is yet more doubtful that the tree is indigenous in Africa, indeed it\r\nis easy to disprove the assertion. Loureiro[977] had seen the species on\r\nthe east coast of this continent, but he supposed it to have been of\r\nAmerican origin. Thonning had not seen it in Guinea, nor Brown in\r\nCongo.[978] It is true that specimens from the last-named country and\r\nfrom the islands in the Gulf of Guinea were sent to the herbarium at\r\nKew, but Oliver says it is cultivated there.[979] A tree which occupies\r\nsuch a large area in America, and which has become naturalized in\r\nseveral districts of India within the last two centuries, would exist\r\nover a great extent of tropical Africa if it were indigenous in that\r\nquarter of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Mango+—_Mangifera indica_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nBelonging to the same order as the _Cashew_, this tree nevertheless\r\nproduces a true fruit, something the colour of the apricot.[980]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to doubt that it is a native of the south of Asia or of\r\nthe Malay Archipelago, when we see the multitude of varieties cultivated\r\nin these countries, the number of ancient common names, in particular a\r\nSanskrit name,[981] its abundance in the gardens of Bengal, of the\r\nDekkan Peninsula, and of Ceylon, even in Rheede’s time. Its cultivation\r\nwas less diffused in the direction of China, for Loureiro only mentions\r\nits existence in Cochin-China. According to Rumphius,[982] it had been\r\nintroduced into certain islands of the Asiatic Archipelago within the\r\nmemory of living men. Forster does not mention it in his work on the\r\nfruits of the Pacific Islands at the time of Cook’s expedition. The name\r\ncommon in the Philippine Isles, _manga_,[983] shows a foreign origin,\r\nfor it is the Malay and Spanish name. The common name in Ceylon is\r\n_ambe_, akin to the Sanskrit _amra_, whence the Persian and Arab\r\n_amb_,[984] the modern Indian names, and perhaps the Malay, _mangka_,\r\n_manga_, _manpelaan_, indicated by Rumphius. There are, however, other\r\nnames used in the Sunda Islands, in the Moluccas, and in Cochin-China.\r\nThe variety of these names argues an ancient introduction into the East\r\nIndian Archipelago, in spite of the opinion of Rumphius.\r\n\r\nThe _Mangifera_ which this author had seen wild in Java, and _Mangifera\r\nsylvatiea_ which Roxburgh had discovered at Silhet, are other species;\r\nbut the true mango is indicated by modern authors as wild in the forests\r\nof Ceylon, the regions at the base of the Himalayas, especially towards\r\nthe east, in Arracan, Pegu, and the Andaman Isles.[985] Miquel does not\r\nmention it as wild in any of the islands of the Malay Archipelago. In\r\nspite of its growing in Ceylon, and the indications, less positive\r\ncertainly, of Sir Joseph Hooker in the _Flora of British India_, the\r\nspecies is probably rare or only naturalized in the Indian Peninsula.\r\nThe size of the stone is too great to allow of its being transported by\r\nbirds, but the frequency of its cultivation causes a dispersion by man’s\r\nagency. If the mango is only naturalized in the west of British India,\r\nthis must have occurred at a remote epoch, as the existence of a\r\nSanskrit name shows. On the other hand, the peoples of Western Asia must\r\nhave known it late, since they did not transport the species into Egypt\r\nor elsewhere towards the west.\r\n\r\nIt is cultivated at the present day in tropical Africa, and even in\r\nMauritius and the Seychelles, where it has become to some extent\r\nnaturalized in the woods.[986]\r\n\r\nIn the new world it was first introduced into Brazil, for the seeds were\r\nbrought thence to Barbados in the middle of the last century.[987] A\r\nFrench vessel was carrying some young trees from Bourbon to Saint\r\nDomingo in 1782, when it was taken by the English, who took them to\r\nJamaica, where they succeeded wonderfully. When the coffee plantations\r\nwere abandoned, at the time of the emancipation of the slaves, the\r\nmango, whose stones the negroes scattered everywhere, formed forests in\r\nevery part of the islands, and these are now valued both for their shade\r\nand as a form of food.[988] It was not cultivated in Cayenne in the time\r\nof Aublet, at the end of the eighteenth century, but now there are\r\nmangoes of the finest kind in this colony. They are grafted, and it is\r\nobserved that their stones produce better fruit than that of the\r\noriginal stock.[989]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Tahiti Apple+—_Spondias dulcis_, Forster.\r\n\r\nThis tree belongs to the family of the _Anacardiaceæ_, and is indigenous\r\nin the Society, Friendly, and Fiji Islands.[990] The natives consumed\r\nquantities of the fruit at the time of Cook’s voyage. It is like a large\r\nplum, of the colour of an apple, and contains a stone covered with long\r\nhooked bristles.[991] The flavour, according to travellers, is\r\nexcellent. It is not among the fruits most widely diffused in tropical\r\ncolonies. It is, however, cultivated in Mauritius and Bourbon, under the\r\nprimitive Polynesian name _evi_ or _hevi_,[992] and in the West Indies.\r\nIt was introduced into Jamaica in 1782, and thence into Saint Domingo.\r\nIts absence in many of the hot countries of Asia and Africa is probably\r\nowing to the fact that the species was discovered, only a century ago,\r\nin small islands which have no communications with other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Strawberry+—_Fragaria vesca_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nOur common strawberry is one of the most widely diffused plants, partly\r\nowing to the small size of its seeds, which birds, attracted by the\r\nfleshy part on which they are found, carry to great distances.\r\n\r\nIt grows wild in Europe, from Lapland and the Shetland Isles[993] to the\r\nmountain ranges in the south; in Madeira, Spain, Sicily, and in\r\nGreece.[994] It is also found in Asia, from Armenia and the north of\r\nSyria[995] to Dahuria. The strawberries of the Himalayas and of\r\nJapan,[996] which several authors have attributed to this species, do\r\nnot perhaps belong to it,[997] and this makes me doubt the assertion of\r\na missionary[998] that it is found in China. It is wild in Iceland,[999]\r\nin the north-east of the United States,[1000] round Fort Cumberland, and\r\non the north-west coast,[1001] perhaps even in the Sierra-Nevada of\r\nCalifornia.[1002] Thus its area extends round the north pole, except in\r\nEastern Siberia and the basin of the river Amur, since the species is\r\nnot mentioned by Maximowicz in his _Primitiæ Floræ Amurensis_. In\r\nAmerica its area is extended along the highlands of Mexico; for\r\n_Fragaria mexicana_, cultivated in the _Jardin des Plantes_, and\r\nexamined by Gay, is _F. vesca_. It also grows round Quito, according to\r\nthe same botanist, who is an authority on this question.[1003]\r\n\r\nThe Greeks and Romans did not cultivate the strawberry. Its cultivation\r\nwas probably introduced in the fifteenth or sixteenth century. Champier,\r\nin the sixteenth century, speaks of it as a novelty in the north of\r\nFrance,[1004] but it already existed in the south, and in England.[1005]\r\n\r\nTransported into gardens in the colonies, the strawberry has become\r\nnaturalized in a few cool localities far from dwellings. This is the\r\ncase in Jamaica,[1006] in Mauritius,[1007] and in Bourbon, where some\r\nplants had been placed by Commerson on the table-land known as the\r\nKaffirs’ Plain. Bory Saint-Vincent relates that in 1801 he found\r\ndistricts quite red with strawberries, and that it was impossible to\r\ncross them without staining the feet red with the juice, mixed with\r\nvolcanic dust.[1008] It is probable that similar cases of naturalization\r\nmay be seen in Tasmania and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe genus Fragaria has been studied with more care than many others, by\r\nDuchesne (_fils_), the Comte de Lambertye, Jacques Gay, and especially\r\nby Madame Eliza Vilmorin, whose faculty of observation was worthy of the\r\nname she bore. A summary of their works, with excellent coloured plates,\r\nis published in the _Jardin Fruitier du Muséum_ by Decaisne. These\r\nauthors have overcome great difficulties in distinguishing the varieties\r\nand hybrids which are multiplied in gardens from the true species, and\r\nin defining these by well-marked characters. Some strawberries whose\r\nfruit is poor have been abandoned, and the finest are the result of the\r\ncrossing of the species of Virginia and Chili, of which I am about to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Virginian Strawberry+—_Fragaria virginiana_, Ehrarht.\r\n\r\nThe scarlet strawberry of French gardens. This species, indigenous in\r\nCanada and in the eastern States of America, and of which one variety\r\nextends west as far as the Rocky Mountains, perhaps even to\r\nOregon,[1009] was introduced into English gardens in 1629.[1010] It was\r\nmuch cultivated in France in the last century, but its hybrids with\r\nother species are now more esteemed.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Chili Strawberry+—_Fragaria Chiloensis_, Duchesne.\r\n\r\nA species common in Southern Chili, at Conception, Valdivia, and\r\nChiloe,[1011] and often cultivated in that country. It was brought to\r\nFrance by Frezier in the year 1715. Cultivated in the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory in France, it spread to England and elsewhere. The large size of\r\nthe berry and its excellent flavour have produced by different\r\ncrossings, especially with _F. virginiana_, the highly prized varieties\r\n_Ananas_, _Victoria_, _Trollope_, _Rubis_, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Bird-Cherry+—_Prunus avium_, Linnæus; _Süsskirschbaum_ in German.\r\n\r\nI use the word cherry because it is customary, and has no inconvenience\r\nwhen speaking of cultivated species or varieties, but the study of\r\nallied wild species confirms the opinion of Linnæus, that the cherries\r\ndo not form a separate genus from the plums.\r\n\r\nAll the varieties of the cultivated cherry belong to two species, which\r\nare found wild: 1. _Prunus avium_, Linnæus, tall, with no suckers from\r\nthe roots, leaves downy on the under side, the fruit sweet; 2. _Prunus\r\ncerasus_, Linnæus, shorter, with suckers from the roots, leaves\r\nglabrous, and fruit more or less sour or bitter.\r\n\r\nThe first of these species, from which the white and black cherries are\r\ndeveloped, is wild in Asia; in the forest of Ghilan (north of Persia),\r\nin the Russian provinces to the south of the Caucasus and in\r\nArmenia;[1012] in Europe in the south of Russia proper, and generally\r\nfrom the south of Sweden to the mountainous parts of Greece, Italy, and\r\nSpain.[1013] It even exists in Algeria.[1014]\r\n\r\nAs we leave the district to the south of the Caspian and Black Seas, the\r\nbird-cherry becomes less common, less natural, and determined more\r\nperhaps by the birds which seek its fruit and carry the seeds from place\r\nto place.[1015] It cannot be doubted that it was thus naturalized, from\r\ncultivation, in the north of India,[1016] in many of the plains of the\r\nsouth of Europe, in Madeira,[1017] and here and there in the United\r\nStates;[1018] but it is probable that in the greater part of Europe this\r\ntook place in prehistoric times, seeing that the agency of birds was\r\nemployed before the first migrations of nations, perhaps before there\r\nwere men in Europe. Its area must have extended in this region as the\r\nglaciers diminished.\r\n\r\nThe common names in ancient languages have been the subject of a learned\r\narticle by Adolphe Pictet,[1019] but nothing relative to the origin of\r\nthe species can be deduced from them; and besides, the different species\r\nand varieties have often been confused in popular nomenclature. It is\r\nfar more important to know whether archæology can tell us anything about\r\nthe presence of the bird-cherry in Europe in prehistoric times.\r\n\r\nHeer gives an illustration of the stones of _Prunus avium_, in his paper\r\non the lake-dwellings of Western Switzerland.[1020] From what he was\r\nkind enough to write to me, April 14, 1881, these stones were found in\r\nthe peat formed above the ancient deposits of the age of stone. De\r\nMortillet[1021] found similar cherry-stones in the lake-dwellings of\r\nBourget belonging to an epoch not very remote, more recent than the\r\nstone age. Dr. Gross sent me some from the locality, also comparatively\r\nrecent, of Corcelette on Lake Neuchâtel, and Strobel and Pigorini\r\ndiscovered some in the “terra-mare” of Parma.[1022] All these are\r\nsettlements posterior to the stone age, and perhaps belonging to\r\nhistoric time. If no more ancient stones of this species are found in\r\nEurope, it will seem probable that naturalization took place after the\r\nAryan migrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Sour Cherry+—_Prunus cerasus_, Linnæus; _Cerasus vulgaris_, Miller;\r\n_Baumweichsel_, _Sauerkirschen_, in German.\r\n\r\nThe _Montmorency_ and _griotte_ cherries, and several other kinds known\r\nto horticulturists, are derived from this species.[1023]\r\n\r\nHohenacker[1024] saw _Prunus cerasus_ at Lenkoran, near the Caspian Sea,\r\nand Koch[1025] in the forests of Asia Minor, that is to say, in the\r\nnorth-east of that country, as that was the region in which he\r\ntravelled. Ancient authors found it at Elisabethpol and Erivan,\r\naccording to Ledebour.[1026] Grisebach[1027] indicates it on Mount\r\nOlympus of Bithynia, and adds that it is nearly wild on the plains of\r\nMacedonia. The true and really ancient habitation seems to extend from\r\nthe Caspian Sea to the environs of Constantinople; but in this very\r\nregion _Prunus avium_ is more common. Indeed, Boissier and Tchihatcheff\r\ndo not appear to have seen _P. cerasus_ even in the Pontus, though they\r\nreceived or brought back several specimens of _P. avium_.[1028]\r\n\r\nIn the north of India, _P. cerasus_ exists only as a cultivated\r\nplant.[1029] The Chinese do not appear to have been acquainted with our\r\ntwo kinds of cherry. Hence it may be assumed that it was not very early\r\nintroduced into India, and the absence of a Sanskrit name confirms this.\r\nWe have seen that, according to Grisebach, _P. cerasus_ is nearly wild\r\nin Macedonia. It was said to be wild in the Crimea, but Steven[1030]\r\nonly saw it cultivated; and Rehmann[1031] gives only the allied species,\r\n_P. chamæcerasus_, Jacquin, as wild in the south of Russia. I very much\r\ndoubt its wild character in any locality north of the Caucasus. Even in\r\nGreece, where Fraas said he saw this tree wild, Heldreich only knows it\r\nas a cultivated species.[1032] In Dalmatia,[1033] a particular variety\r\nor allied species, _P. Marasca_, is found really wild; it is used in\r\nmaking Maraschino wine. _P. cerasus_ is wild in mountainous parts of\r\nItaly[1034] and in the centre of France,[1035] but farther to the west\r\nand north, and in Spain, the species is only found cultivated, and\r\nnaturalized here and there as a bush. _P. cerasus_, more than the\r\nbird-cherry, evidently presents itself in Europe, as a foreign tree not\r\ncompletely naturalized.\r\n\r\nNone of the often-quoted passages[1036] in Theophrastus, Pliny, and\r\nother ancient authors appear to apply to _P. cerasus_.[1037] The most\r\nimportant, that of Theophrastus, belongs to _Prunus avium_, because of\r\nthe height of the tree, a character which distinguishes it from _P.\r\ncerasus_. _Kerasos_ being the name for the bird-cherry in Theophrastus,\r\nas now _kerasaia_ among the modern Greeks, I notice a linguistic proof\r\nof the antiquity of _P. cerasus_. The Albanians, descendants of the\r\nPelasgians, call the latter _vyssine_, an ancient name which reappears\r\nin the German _Wechsel_, and the Italian _visciolo_.[1038] As the\r\nAlbanians have also the name _kerasie_ for _P. avium_, it is probable\r\nthat their ancestors very clearly distinguished the two species by\r\ndifferent names, perhaps before the arrival of the Hellenes in Greece.\r\n\r\nAnother indication of antiquity may be seen in Virgil (_Geor._ ii. 17)—\r\n\r\n   “Pullulat ab radice aliis densissima silva\r\n    Ut cerasis ulmisque”—\r\n\r\nwhich applies to _P. cerasus_, not to _P. avium_.\r\n\r\nTwo paintings of the cherry tree were found at Pompeii, but it seems\r\nthat it cannot be discovered to which of the two species they should be\r\nattributed.[1039] Comes calls them _Prunus cerasus_.\r\n\r\nAny archæological discovery would be more convincing. The stones of the\r\ntwo species present a difference in the furrow or groove, which has not\r\nescaped the observation of Heer and Sordelli. Unfortunately, only one\r\nstone of _P. cerasus_ has been found in the prehistoric settlements of\r\nItaly and Switzerland, and what is more, it is not quite certain from\r\nwhat stratum it was taken. It appears that it was a non-archæological\r\nstratum.[1040]\r\n\r\nFrom all these data, somewhat contradictory and sufficiently vague, I am\r\ninclined to admit that _Prunus cerasus_ was known and already becoming\r\nnaturalized at the beginning of Greek civilization, and a little later\r\nin Italy before the epoch when Lucullus brought a cherry tree from Asia\r\nMinor. Pages might be transcribed from authors, even modern ones, who\r\nattribute, after Pliny, the introduction of the cherry into Italy to\r\nthis rich Roman, in the year 65 B.C. Since this error is perpetuated by\r\nits incessant repetition in classical schools, it must once more be said\r\nthat cherry trees (at least the bird-cherry) existed in Italy before\r\nLucullus, and that the famous _gourmet_ did not need to go far to seek\r\nthe species with sour or bitter fruit. I have no doubt that he pleased\r\nthe Romans with a good variety cultivated in the Pontus, and that\r\ncultivators hastened to propagate it by grafting, but Lucullus’ share in\r\nthe matter was confined to this.\r\n\r\nFrom what is now known of Kerasunt and the ancient names of the cherry\r\ntree, I venture to maintain, contrary to the received opinion, that it\r\nwas a variety of the bird-cherry of which the fleshy fruit is of a sweet\r\nflavour. I am inclined to think so because _Kerasos_ in Theophrastus is\r\nthe name of _Prunus avium_, which is far the commoner of the two in Asia\r\nMinor. The town of Kerasunt took its name from the tree, and it is\r\nprobable that the abundance of _Prunus avium_ in the neighbouring woods\r\nhad induced the inhabitants to seek the trees which yielded the best\r\nfruits in order to plant them in their gardens. Certainly, if Lucullus\r\nbrought fine white-heart cherries to Rome, his countrymen who only knew\r\nthe little wild cherry may well have said, “It is a fruit which we have\r\nnot.” Pliny affirms nothing more.\r\n\r\nI must not conclude without suggesting a hypothesis about the two kinds\r\nof cherry. They differ but little in character, and, what is very rare,\r\ntheir two ancient habitations, which are most clearly proved, are\r\nsimilar (from the Caspian Sea to Western Anatolia). The two species have\r\nspread towards the West, but unequally. That which is commonest in its\r\noriginal home and the stronger of the two (_P. avium_) has extended\r\nfurther and at an earlier epoch, and has become better naturalized _P.\r\ncerasus_ is, therefore, perhaps derived from the other in prehistoric\r\ntimes. I come thus, by a different road, to an idea suggested by\r\nCaruel;[1041] only, instead of saying that it would perhaps be better to\r\nunite them now in one species, I consider them actually distinct, and\r\ncontent myself with supposing a descent, which for the rest it would not\r\nbe easy to prove.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Cultivated Plums.+\r\n\r\nPliny[1042] speaks of the immense quantity of plums known in his time:\r\n_ingens turba prunorum_. Horticulturists now number more than three\r\nhundred. Some botanists have tried to attribute these to distinct wild\r\nspecies, but they have not always agreed, and judging from the specific\r\nnames especially they seem to have had very different ideas. This\r\ndiversity is on two heads; first as to the descent of a given cultivated\r\nvariety, and secondly as to the distinction of the wild forms into\r\nspecies or varieties.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to classify the innumerable cultivated forms, and I\r\nthink that labour useless when dealing with the question of geographical\r\norigin, for the differences lie principally in the shape, size, colour,\r\nand taste of the fruit, in characters, that is to say, which it has been\r\nthe interest of horticulturists to cultivate when they occur, and even\r\nto create as far as it was in their power to do so. It is better to\r\ninsist upon the distinction of the forms observed in a wild state,\r\nespecially upon those from which man derives no advantage, and which\r\nhave probably remained as they were before the existence of gardens.\r\n\r\nIt is probably only for about thirty years that botanists have given\r\nreally comparative characters for the three species or varieties which\r\nexist in nature.[1043] They may be summed up as follows:—\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_, Linnæus. Tree or tall shrub, without thorns; young\r\nbranches glabrous; flowers appearing with the leaves, their peduncles\r\nusually downy; fruit pendulous, ovoid and of a sweet flavour.\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_, Linnæus. Tree or tall shrub, without thorns; young\r\nshoots covered with a velvet down; flowers appearing with the leaves,\r\nwith peduncles covered with a fine down, or glabrous; fruit pendulous,\r\nround or slightly elliptical, of a sweet flavour.\r\n\r\n_Prunus spinosa,_ Linnæus. A thorny shrub, with branches spreading out\r\nat right angles; young shoots downy; flowers appearing before the\r\nleaves; pedicles glabrous; fruit upright, round, and very sour.\r\n\r\nThis third form, so common in our hedges (sloe or blackthorn), is very\r\ndifferent from the other two. Therefore, unless we interpret by\r\nhypothesis what may have happened before all observation, it seems to me\r\nimpossible to consider the three forms as constituting one and the same\r\nspecies, unless we can show transitions from one to the other in those\r\norgans which have not been modified by cultivation, and hitherto this\r\nhas not been done. At most the fusion of the two first categories can be\r\nadmitted. The two forms with naturally sweet fruit occur in few\r\ncountries. These must have tempted cultivators more than _Prunus\r\nspinosa_, whose fruit is so sour. It is, therefore, in these that we\r\nmust seek to find the originals of cultivated plums. For greater\r\nclearness I shall speak of them as two species.[1044]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Common Plum+—_Prunus domestica_, Linnæus; _Zwetchen_ in German.\r\n\r\nSeveral botanists[1045] have found this variety wild throughout\r\nAnatolia, the region to the south of the Caucasus and Northern Persia,\r\nin the neighbourhood of Mount Elbruz, for example.\r\n\r\nI know of no proof for the localities of Kashmir, the country of the\r\nKirghis and of China, which are mentioned in some floras. The species is\r\noften doubtful, and it is probably rather _Prunus insititia_; in other\r\ncases it is its true and ancient wild character which is uncertain, for\r\nthe stones have evidently been dispersed from cultivation. Its area does\r\nnot appear to extend as far as Lebanon, although the plums cultivated at\r\nDamascus (damascenes, or damsons) have a reputation which dates from the\r\ndays of Pliny. It is supposed that this was the species referred to by\r\nDioscorides[1046] under the name of _Syrian coccumelea_, growing at\r\nDamascus. Karl Koch relates that the merchants trading on the borders of\r\nChina told him that the species was common in the forests of the western\r\npart of the empire. It is true that the Chinese have cultivated\r\ndifferent kinds of plums from time immemorial, but we do not know them\r\nwell enough to judge of them, and we cannot be sure that they are\r\nindigenous. As none of our kinds of plum has been found wild in Japan or\r\nin the basin of the river Amur, it is very probable that the species\r\nseen in China are different to ours. This appears also to be the result\r\nof Bretschneider’s statements.[1047]\r\n\r\nIt is very doubtful if _Prunus domestica_ is indigenous in Europe. In\r\nthe south, where it is given, it grows chiefly in hedges, near\r\ndwellings, with all the appearance of a tree scarcely naturalized, and\r\nmaintained here and there by the constant bringing of stones from\r\nplantations. Authors who have seen the species in the East do not\r\nhesitate to say that it is “subspontaneous.” Fraas[1048] affirms that it\r\nis not wild in Greece, and this is confirmed as far as Attica is\r\nconcerned by Heldreich.[1049] Steven[1050] says the same for the Crimea.\r\nIf this is the case near Asia Minor, it must be the more readily\r\nadmitted for the rest of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the abundance of plums cultivated formerly by the Romans, no\r\nkind is found represented in the frescoes at Pompeii.[1051] Neither has\r\n_Prunus domestica_ been found among the remains of the lake-dwellings of\r\nItaly, Switzerland, and Savoy, where, however, stones of _Prunus\r\ninsititia_ and _spinosa_ have been discovered. From these facts, and the\r\nsmall number of words attributable to this species in Greek authors, it\r\nmay be inferred that its half-wild or half-naturalized state dates in\r\nEurope from two thousand years at most.\r\n\r\nPrunes and damsons are ranked with this species.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Bullace+—_Prunus insititia_, Linnæus;[1052] _Pflauenbaum_ and\r\n_Haferschlehen_ in German.\r\n\r\nThis kind of plum grows wild in the south of Europe.[1053] It has also\r\nbeen found in Cilicia, Armenia, to the south of the Caucasus, and in the\r\nprovince of Talysch near the Caspian Sea.[1054] It is especially in\r\nTurkey in Europe and to the south of the Caucasus that it appears to be\r\ntruly wild. In Italy and in Spain it is perhaps less so, although\r\ntrustworthy authors who have seen the plant growing have no doubt about\r\nit. In the localities named north of the Alps, even as far as Denmark,\r\nit is probably naturalized from cultivation. The species is commonly\r\nfound in hedges not far from dwellings, and apparently not truly wild.\r\n\r\nAll this agrees with archæological and historical data. The ancient\r\nGreeks distinguished the _Coccumelea_ of their country from those of\r\nSyria,[1055] whence it is inferred that the former were _Prunus\r\ninsititia_. This seems the more likely that the modern Greeks call it\r\n_coromeleia_.[1056] The Albanians say _corombile_,[1057] which has led\r\nsome people to suppose an ancient Pelasgian origin. For the rest, we\r\nmust not insist upon the common names of the plum which each nation may\r\nhave given to one or another species, perhaps also to some cultivated\r\nvariety, without any rule. The names which have been much commented upon\r\nin learned works generally, appear to me to apply to any plum or plum\r\ntree without having any very defined meaning.\r\n\r\nNo stones of _P. insititia_ have yet been found in the _terra-mare_ of\r\nItaly, but Heer has described and given illustrations of some which were\r\nfound in the lake-dwellings of Robenhausen.[1058] The species does not\r\nseem to be now indigenous in this part of Switzerland, but we must not\r\nforget that, as we saw in the history of flax, the lake-dwellers of the\r\ncanton of Zürich, in the age of stone, had communications with Italy.\r\nThese ancient Swiss were not hard to please in the matter of food, for\r\nthey also gathered the berries of the blackthorn, which are, as we\r\nthink, uneatable. It is probable that they ate them cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Apricot+—_Prunus armeniaca_, Linnæus; _Armenica vulgaris_, Lamarck.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks and Romans received the apricot about the beginning of the\r\nChristian era. Unknown in the time of Theophrastus, Dioscorides[1059]\r\nmentions it under the name of _mailon armeniacon_. He says that the\r\nLatins called it _praikokion_. It is, in fact, one of the fruits\r\nmentioned briefly by Pliny,[1060] under the name of _præcocium_, so\r\ncalled from the precocity of the species.[1061] Its Armenian origin is\r\nindicated by the Greek name, but this name might mean only that the\r\nspecies was cultivated in Armenia. Modern botanists have long had good\r\nreason to believe that the species is wild in that country. Pallas,\r\nGuldenstadt, and Hohenacker say they found it in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Caucasus Mountains, on the north, on the banks of the Terek, and to\r\nthe south between the Caspian and Black Seas.[1062] Boissier[1063]\r\nadmits all these localities, but without saying anything about the wild\r\ncharacter of the species. He saw a specimen gathered by Hohenacker, near\r\nElisabethpol. On the other hand, Tchihatcheff[1064] who has crossed\r\nAnatolia and Armenia several times, does not seem to have seen the wild\r\napricot; and what is still more significant, Karl Koch, who travelled\r\nthrough the region to the south of the Caucasus, in order to observe\r\nfacts of this nature, expresses himself as follows:[1065] “Native\r\ncountry unknown. At least, during my long sojourn in Armenia, I nowhere\r\nfound the apricot wild, and I have rarely seen it even cultivated.”\r\n\r\nA traveller, W. J. Hamilton,[1066] said he found it wild near Orgou and\r\nOutch Hisar in Anatolia: but this assertion has not been verified by a\r\nbotanist. The supposed wild apricot of the ruins of Baalbek, described\r\nby Eusèbe de Salle[1067] is, from what he says of the leaf and fruit,\r\ntotally different to the common apricot. Boissier, and the different\r\ncollectors who sent him plants from Syria and Lebanon, do not appear to\r\nhave seen the species. Spach[1068] asserts that it is indigenous in\r\nPersia, but he gives no proof. Boissier and Buhse[1069] do not mention\r\nit in their list of the plants of Transcaucasia and Persia. It is\r\nuseless to seek its origin in Africa. The apricots which Reynier[1070]\r\nsays he saw, “almost wild,” in Upper Egypt must have sprung from stones\r\ngrown in cultivated ground, as is seen in Algeria.[1071] Schweinfurth\r\nand Ascherson,[1072] in their catalogue of the plants of Egypt and\r\nAbyssinia, only mention the species as cultivated. Besides, if it had\r\nexisted formerly in the north of Africa it would have been early known\r\nto the Hebrews and the Romans. Now there is no Hebrew name, and Pliny\r\nsays its introduction at Rome took place thirty years before he wrote.\r\n\r\nCarrying our researches eastward, we find that Anglo-Indian\r\nbotanists[1073] are agreed in considering that the apricot, which is\r\ngenerally cultivated in the north of India and in Thibet, is not wild in\r\nthose regions; but they add that it has a tendency to become\r\nnaturalized, and that it is found upon the site of ruined villages.\r\nMessrs. Schlagintweit brought specimens from the north-west provinces of\r\nIndia, and from Thibet, which Westmael verified,[1074] but he was kind\r\nenough to write to me that he cannot affirm that it was wild, since the\r\ncollector’s label gives no information on that head.\r\n\r\nRoxburgh,[1075] who did not neglect the question of origin, says,\r\nspeaking of the apricot, “native of China as well as the west of Asia.”\r\nI read in Dr. Bretschneider’s curious little work,[1076] drawn up at\r\nPekin, the following passage, which seems to me to decide the question\r\nin favour of a Chinese origin:—“_Sing_, as is well known, is the\r\napricot (_Prunus armeniaca_). The character (a Chinese sign printed on\r\np. 10) does not exist as indicating a fruit, either in the _Shu-king_,\r\nor in the _Shi-king_, _Cihouli_, etc., but the _Shan-hai-king_ says that\r\nseveral _sings_ grow upon the hills (here a Chinese character). Besides,\r\nthe name of the apricot is represented by a particular sign which may\r\nshow that it is indigenous in China.” The _Shan-hai-king_ is attributed\r\nto the Emperor Yü, who lived in 2205-2198 B.C. Decaisne,[1077] who was\r\nthe first to suspect the Chinese origin of the apricot, has recently\r\nreceived from Dr. Bretschneider some specimens accompanied by the\r\nfollowing note:—“No. 24, apricot wild in the mountains of Pekin, where\r\nit grows in abundance; the fruit is small (an inch and a quarter in\r\ndiameter), the skin red and yellow; the flesh salmon colour, sour, but\r\neatable. No. 25, the stone of the apricot cultivated round Pekin. The\r\nfruit is twice as large as that of the wild tree.”[1078] Decaisne adds,\r\nin the letter he was good enough to write to me, “In shape and surface\r\nthe stones are exactly like those of our small apricots; they are smooth\r\nand not pitted.” The leaves he sent me are certainly those of the\r\napricot.\r\n\r\nThe apricot is not mentioned in Japan, or in the basin of the river\r\nAmoor.[1079] Perhaps the cold of the winter is too great. If we\r\nrecollect the absence of communication in ancient times between China\r\nand India, and the assertions that the plant is indigenous in both\r\ncountries, we are at first tempted to believe that the ancient area\r\nextended from the north-west of India to China. However, if we wish to\r\nadopt this hypothesis, we must also admit that the culture of the\r\napricot spread very late towards the West.[1080] For no Sanskrit or\r\nHebrew name is known, but only a Hindu name, _zard alu_, and a Persian\r\nname, _mischmisch_, which has passed into Arabic.[1081] How is it to be\r\nsupposed that so excellent a fruit, and one which grows in abundance in\r\nWestern Asia, spread so slowly from the north-west of India towards the\r\nGræco-Roman world? The Chinese knew it two or three thousand years\r\nbefore the Christian era. Chang-kien went as far as Bactriana, a century\r\nbefore our era, and he was the first to make the West known to his\r\nfellow-countrymen.[1082] It was then, perhaps, that the apricot was\r\nintroduced in Western Asia, and that it was cultivated and became\r\nnaturalized here and there in the north-west of India, and at the foot\r\nof the Caucasus, by the scattering of the stones beyond the limits of\r\nthe plantations.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Almond+—_Amygdalus communis_, Linnæus; _Pruni species_, Baillon;\r\n_Prunus Amygdalus_, Hooker.\r\n\r\nThe almond grows apparently wild or half wild in the warm, dry regions\r\nof the Mediterranean basin and of western temperate Asia. As the nuts\r\nfrom cultivated trees naturalize the species very easily, we must have\r\nrecourse to various indications to discern its ancient home.\r\n\r\nWe may first discard the notion of its origin in Eastern Asia. Japanese\r\nfloras make no mention of the almond. That which M. de Bonge saw\r\ncultivated in the north of China was the _Persica Davidiana_.[1083] Dr.\r\nBretschneider,[1084] in his classical work, tells us that he has never\r\nseen the almond cultivated in China, and that the compilation entitled\r\n_Pent-sao_, published in the tenth or eleventh century of our era,\r\ndescribes it as a tree of the country of the Mahometans, which signifies\r\nthe north-west of India, or Persia.\r\n\r\nAnglo-Indian botanists[1085] say that the almond is cultivated in the\r\ncool parts of India, but some add that it does not thrive, and that many\r\nalmonds are brought from Persia.[1086] No Sanskrit name is known, nor\r\neven any in the languages derived from Sanskrit. Evidently the\r\nnorth-west of India is not the original home of the species.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are many localities in the region extending\r\nfrom Mesopotamia and Turkestan to Algeria, where excellent botanists\r\nhave found the almond tree quite wild. Boissier[1087] has seen specimens\r\ngathered in rocky ground in Mesopotamia, Aderbijan, Turkestan,\r\nKurdistan, and in the forests of the Anti-Lebanon. Karl Koch[1088] has\r\nnot found it wild to the south of the Caucasus, nor Tchihatcheff in Asia\r\nMinor. Cosson[1089] found natural woods of almond trees near Saida in\r\nAlgeria. It is also regarded as wild on the coasts of Sicily and of\r\nGreece;[1090] but there, and still more in the localities in which it\r\noccurs in Italy, Spain, and France, it is probable, and almost certain,\r\nthat it springs from the casual dispersal of the nuts from cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of its existence in Western Asia is proved by Hebrew names\r\nfor the almond tree—_schaked_, _luz_ or _lus_ (which recurs in the\r\nArabic _louz_), and _schekedim_ for the nut.[1091] The Persians have\r\nanother name, _badam_, but I do not know how old this is. Theophrastus\r\nand Dioscorides[1092] mention the almond by an entirely different name,\r\n_amugdalai_, translated by the Latins into _amygdalus_. It may be\r\ninferred from this that the Greeks did not receive the species from the\r\ninterior of Asia, but found it in their own country, or at least in\r\nAsia Minor. The almond tree is represented in several frescoes found at\r\nPompeii.[1093] Pliny[1094] doubts whether the species was known in Italy\r\nin Cato’s time, because it was called the Greek nut. It is very possible\r\nthat the almond was introduced into Italy from the Greek islands.\r\nAlmonds have not been found in the _terra-mare_ of the neighbourhood of\r\nParma, even in the upper layers.\r\n\r\nThe late introduction of the species into Italy, and the absence of\r\nnaturalization in Sardinia and Spain,[1095] incline me to doubt whether\r\nit is really indigenous in the north of Africa and Sicily. In the latter\r\ncountries it was more probably naturalized some centuries ago. In\r\nconfirmation of this hypothesis, I note that the Berber name of the\r\nalmond, _talouzet_,[1096] is evidently connected with the Arabic _louz_,\r\nthat is to say with the language of the conquerors who came after the\r\nRomans. In Western Asia, on the contrary, and even in some parts of\r\nGreece, it may be regarded as indigenous from prehistoric time. I do not\r\nsay primitive, for everything was preceded by something else. I remark\r\nfinally that the difference between bitter and sweet almonds was known\r\nto the Greeks and even to the Hebrews.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Peach+—_Amygdalus persica_, Linnæus; _Persica vulgaris_, Miller;\r\n_Prunus persica_, Bentham and Hooker.\r\n\r\nI will quote the article in which I formerly[1097] attributed a Chinese\r\norigin to the peach, a contrary opinion to that which prevailed at the\r\ntime, and which people who are not on a par with modern science continue\r\nto reproduce. I will afterwards give the facts discovered since 1855.\r\n\r\n“The Greeks and Romans received the peach shortly after the beginning\r\nof the Christian era. The names _persica_, _malum persicum_, indicate\r\nwhence they had it. I need not dwell upon those well-known facts.[1098]\r\nSeveral kinds of peach are now cultivated in the north of India,[1099]\r\nbut, what is remarkable, no Sanskrit name is known;[1100] whence we may\r\ninfer that its existence and its cultivation are of no great antiquity\r\nin these regions. Roxburgh, who is usually careful to give the modern\r\nIndian names, only mentions Arab and Chinese names. Piddington gives no\r\nIndian name, and Royle only Persian names. The peach does not succeed,\r\nor requires the greatest care to ensure success, in the north-east of\r\nIndia.[1101] In China, on the contrary, its cultivation dates from the\r\nremotest antiquity. A number of superstitious ideas and of legends about\r\nthe properties of its different varieties exist in that country.[1102]\r\nThese varieties are very numerous;[1103] and in particular the singular\r\nvariety with compressed or flattened fruit,[1104] which appears to be\r\nfurther removed than any other from the natural state of the peach;\r\nlastly, a simple name, _to_, is given to the common peach.[1105]\r\n\r\n“From all these facts, I am inclined to believe that the peach is of\r\nChinese rather than of western Asiatic origin. If it had existed in\r\nPersia or Armenia from all time, the knowledge and cultivation of so\r\npleasant a fruit would have spread earlier into Asia Minor and Greece.\r\nThe expedition of Alexander probably was the means of making it known to\r\nTheophrastus (332 B.C.), who speaks of it as a Persian fruit. Perhaps\r\nthis vague idea of the Greeks dates from the retreat of the ten thousand\r\n(401 B.C.); but Xenophon does not mention the peach. Nor do the Hebrew\r\nwritings speak of it. The peach has no Sanskrit name, yet the peoples\r\nwho spoke this language came into India from the north-west; that is to\r\nsay, from the generally received home of the species. On this\r\nhypothesis, how are we to account for the fact that neither the Greeks\r\nof the early times of Greece, nor the Hebrews, nor the Sanskrit-speaking\r\npeoples, who all radiated from the upper part of the Euphrates valley or\r\ncommunicated with it, did not cultivate the peach? On the other hand, it\r\nis very possible that the stones of a fruit tree cultivated in China\r\nfrom the remotest times, should have been carried over the mountains\r\nfrom the centre of Asia into Kashmir, Bokhara, and Persia. The Chinese\r\nhad very early discovered this route. The importation would have taken\r\nplace between the epoch of the Sanskrit emigrations and the relations of\r\nthe Persians with the Greeks. The cultivation of the peach, once\r\nestablished in Persia, would have easily spread on the one side towards\r\nthe west; on the other, through Cabul towards the north of India, where\r\nit is not so very ancient.\r\n\r\n“In confirmation of the hypothesis of a Chinese origin, it may be added\r\nthat the peach was introduced into Cochin-China from China,[1106] and\r\nthat the Japanese give the Chinese name _Tao_[1107] to the peach. M.\r\nStanislas Julien was kind enough to read to me in French some passages\r\nof the Japanese encyclopædia (bk. lxxxvi. p. 7), in which the peach tree\r\n_tao_ is said to be a tree of Western countries, which should be\r\nunderstood to mean the interior of China as compared to the eastern\r\ncoast, since the passage is taken from a Chinese author. The _tao_\r\noccurs in the writings of Confucius in the fifth century before the\r\nChristian era, and even in the _Ritual_ in the tenth century before\r\nChrist. Its wild nature is not specified in the encyclopædia of which I\r\nhave just spoken; but Chinese authors pay little attention to this\r\npoint.”\r\n\r\nAfter a few details about the common names of the peach in different\r\nlanguages, I went on to say, “The absence of Sanskrit and Hebrew names\r\nremains the most important fact, whence we may infer an introduction\r\ninto Western Asia from a more distant land, that is to say, from China.\r\n\r\n“The peach has been found wild in different parts of Asia; but it is\r\nalways a question whether it is indigenous there, or whether it sprang\r\nfrom the dispersion of stones produced by cultivated trees. The question\r\nis the more necessary since the stones germinate easily, and several of\r\nthe modifications of the peach are hereditary.[1108] Apparently wild\r\npeach trees have often been found in the neighbourhood of the Caucasus.\r\nPallas[1109] saw several on the banks of the Terek, where the\r\ninhabitants give it a name which he calls Persian, _scheptata_.[1110]\r\nIts fruit is velvety, sour, not very fleshy, and hardly larger than a\r\nwalnut; the tree small. Pallas suspects that this tree has degenerated\r\nfrom cultivated peaches. He adds that it is found in the Crimea, to the\r\nsouth of the Caucasus, and in Persia; but Marshall, Bieberstein, Meyer,\r\nand Hohenacker do not give the wild peach in the neighbourhood of the\r\nCaucasus. Early travellers, Gmelin, Guldenstadt, and Georgi, quoted by\r\nLedebour, mentioned it. C. Koch[1111] is the only modern botanist who\r\nsaid he found the peach tree in abundance in the Caucasian provinces.\r\nLedebour, however, prudently adds, Is it wild? The stones which\r\nBrugnière and Olivier brought from Ispahan, which were sown in Paris and\r\nyielded a good velvety peach, were not, as Bosc[1112] asserted, taken\r\nfrom a peach tree wild in Persia, but from one growing in a garden at\r\nIspahan.[1113] I do not know of any proof of a peach tree found wild in\r\nPersia, and if travellers mention any it is always to be feared that\r\nthese are only sown trees. Dr. Royle[1114] says that the peach grows\r\nwild in several places south of the Himalayas, notably near Mussouri,\r\nbut we have seen that its culture is not ancient in these regions, and\r\nneither Roxburgh nor Don’s _Flora Nepalensis_ mention the peach.\r\nBunge[1115] only found cultivated trees in the north of China. This\r\ncountry has hardly been explored, and Chinese legends seem sometimes to\r\nindicate wild peaches. Thus the _Chou-y-ki_, according to the author\r\npreviously quoted, says, ‘Whosoever eats of the peaches of Mount\r\nKouoliou shall obtain eternal life.’ For Japan, Thunberg[1116] says,\r\n_Crescit ubique vulgaris, præcipue juxta Nagasaki. In omni horto colitur\r\nob elegantiam florum._ It seems from this passage that the species grows\r\nboth in and out of gardens, but perhaps in the first case he only\r\nalludes to peaches growing in the open air and without shelter.\r\n\r\n“I have said nothing hitherto of the distinction to be established\r\nbetween the different varieties or species of the peach, since most of\r\nthem are cultivated in all countries—at least the clearly defined kinds,\r\nwhich may be considered as botanical species. Thus the great distinction\r\nbetween the downy and smooth-skinned fruits (peaches proper and\r\nnectarines), on which it is proposed to found two species (_Persica\r\nvulgaris_, Mill, and _P. levis_, D. C.), exists in Japan[1117] and in\r\nEurope, as in most of the intermediate countries.[1118] Less importance\r\nis attached to distinctions founded on the adherence or non-adherence of\r\nthe skin, on the white, yellow, or red colour of the flesh, and on the\r\ngeneral form of the fruit. The great division into peaches and\r\nnectarines presents most of these modifications in Europe, in Western\r\nAsia, and probably in China. It is certain that in the latter country\r\nthe form of the fruit varies more than elsewhere; for there are as in\r\nEurope oval peaches, and also the peaches of which I spoke just now,\r\nwhich are quite flattened, in which the top of the stone is not even\r\ncovered with flesh.[1119] The colour also varies greatly.[1120] In\r\nEurope the most distinct varieties, nectarines and peaches, freestones\r\nand clingstones, existed three centuries ago, for J. Bauhin enumerates\r\nthem very clearly;[1121] and before him Dalechamp, in 1587, also gave\r\nthe principal ones.[1122] At that time nectarines were called\r\n_Nucipersica_, because of their resemblance in shape, size, and colour\r\nto the walnut. It is in the same sense that the Italians call them\r\n_pescanoce_.\r\n\r\n“I have sought in vain for a proof that the nectarine existed in Italy\r\nin the time of ancient Rome. Pliny,[1123] who confounds in his\r\ncompilation peaches, plums, the _Laurus Persea_,[1124] and perhaps other\r\ntrees, says nothing which can apply to such a fruit. Sometimes people\r\nhave thought they recognized it in the _tuberes_ of which he speaks. It\r\nwas a tree imported from Syria in the time of Augustus. There were both\r\nred and white tuberes. Others (_tuberes?_ or _mala?_) of the\r\nneighbourhood of Verona were downy. Some graceful verses of Petronus,\r\nquoted by Dalechamp,[1125] clearly prove that the _tuberes_ of the\r\nRomans in Nero’s time were a smooth-skinned fruit; but this might be the\r\njujube (_Zizyphus_), _Diospyros_, or some _Cratægus_, just as well as\r\nthe smooth-skinned peach. Each author in the time of the Renaissance had\r\nhis opinion on this point, or criticized that of the others.[1126]\r\nPerhaps there were two or three species of _tuberes_, as Pliny says, and\r\none of them which was grafted on plum trees was the nectarine (?)[1127]\r\nbut I doubt whether this question can ever be cleared up.[1128]\r\n\r\n“Even admitting that the _Nucipersica_ was only introduced into Europe\r\nin the Middle Ages, we cannot help remarking that in European gardens\r\nfor centuries, and in Japan from time unknown, there was an intermixture\r\nof all the principal kinds of peach. It seems that its different\r\nqualities were produced everywhere from a primitive species, which was\r\nprobably the downy peach. If the two kinds had existed from the\r\nbeginning, either they would have been in different countries, and their\r\ncultivation would have been established separately, or they would have\r\nbeen in the same country, and in this case it is probable that one kind\r\nwould have been anciently introduced into this country and the other\r\ninto that.”\r\n\r\nI laid stress, in 1855, on other considerations in support of the theory\r\nthat the nectarine is derived from the common peach; but Darwin has\r\ngiven such a large number of cases in which a branch of nectarine has\r\nunexpectedly appeared upon a peach tree, that it is useless to insist\r\nlonger upon this point, and I will only add that the nectarine has every\r\nappearance of an artificial tree. Not only is it not found wild, but it\r\nnever becomes naturalized, and each tree lives for a shorter time than\r\nthe common peach. It is, in fact, a weakened form.\r\n\r\n“The facility,” I said, “with which our peach trees are multiplied from\r\nseed in America, and have produced fleshy fruits, sometimes very fine\r\nones, without the resource of grafting, inclines me to think that the\r\nspecies is in a natural state, little changed by a long cultivation or\r\nby hybrid fertilization. In Virginia and the neighbouring states there\r\nare peaches grown on trees raised from seed and not grafted, and their\r\nabundance is so great that brandy is made from them.[1129] On some trees\r\nthe fruit is magnificent.[1130] At Juan Fernandez, says Bertero,[1131]\r\nthe peach tree is so abundant that it is impossible to form an idea of\r\nthe quantity of fruit which is gathered; it is usually very good,\r\nalthough the trees have reverted to a wild condition. From these\r\ninstances it would not be surprising if the wild peaches with\r\nindifferent fruit found in Western Asia were simply naturalized trees in\r\na climate not wholly favourable, and that the species was of Chinese\r\norigin, where its cultivation seems most ancient.”\r\n\r\nDr. Bretschneider,[1132] who at Pekin has access to all the resources of\r\nChinese literature, merely says, after reading the above passages,\r\n“_Tao_ is the peach tree. De Candolle thinks that China is the native\r\ncountry of the peach. He may be right.”\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of the existence of the species and its wild nature in\r\nWestern Asia have become more doubtful since 1855. Anglo-Indian\r\nbotanists speak of the peach solely as a cultivated tree,[1133] or as\r\ncultivated and becoming naturalized and apparently wild in the\r\nnorth-west of India.[1134] Boissier[1135] mentions specimens gathered in\r\nGhilan and to the south of the Caucasus, but he says nothing as to their\r\nwild nature; and Karl Koch,[1136] after travelling through this\r\ndistrict, says, speaking of the peach, “Country unknown, perhaps Persia.\r\nBoissier saw trees growing in the gorges on Mount Hymettus, near\r\nAthens.”\r\n\r\nThe peach spreads easily in the countries in which it is cultivated, so\r\nthat it is hard to say whether a given tree is of natural origin and\r\nanterior to cultivation, or whether it is naturalized. But it certainly\r\nwas first cultivated in China; it was spoken of there two thousand years\r\nbefore its introduction into the Greco-Roman world, a thousand years\r\nperhaps before its introduction into the lands of the Sanskrit-speaking\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThe group of peaches (genus or subgenus) is composed of five forms,\r\nwhich Decaisne[1137] regards as species, but which other botanists are\r\ninclined to call varieties. The one is the common peach; the second the\r\nnectarine, which we know to be derived; the third is the flattened peach\r\n(_P. platycarpa_, Decaisne) cultivated in China; and the two last are\r\nindigenous in China (_P. simonii_, Decaisne, and _P. Davidii_,\r\nCarrière). It is, therefore, essentially a Chinese group.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, from all these facts, not to admit the Chinese origin\r\nof the common peach, as I had formerly inferred from more scanty data.\r\nIts arrival in Italy at the beginning of the Christian era is now\r\nconfirmed by the absence of peach stones in the _terra-mare_ or\r\nlake-dwellings of Parma and Lombardy, and by the representations of the\r\npeach tree in the paintings on the walls of the richer houses in\r\nPompeii.[1138]\r\n\r\nI have yet to deal with an opinion formerly expressed by Knight, and\r\nsupported by several horticulturists, that the peach is a modification\r\nof the almond. Darwin[1139] collected facts in support of this idea, not\r\nomitting to mention one which seems opposed to it. They may be concisely\r\nput as follows:—(1) Crossed fertilization, which presented Knight with\r\nsomewhat doubtful results; (2) intermediate forms, as to the fleshiness\r\nof the fruit and the size of the nut or stone, obtained by sowing peach\r\nstones, or by chance in plantations, forms of which the almond-peach is\r\nan example which has long been known. Decaisne[1140] pointed out\r\ndifferences between the almond and peach in the size and length of the\r\nleaves independently of the fruit. He calls Knight’s theory a “strange\r\nhypothesis.”\r\n\r\nGeographical botany opposes his hypothesis, for the almond tree has its\r\norigin in Western Asia; it was not indigenous in the centre of the\r\nAsiatic continent, and its introduction into China as a cultivated\r\nspecies was not anterior to the Christian era. The Chinese, however, had\r\nalready possessed for thousands of years different varieties of the\r\ncommon peach besides the two wild forms I have just mentioned. The\r\nalmond and the peach, starting from two such widely separated regions,\r\ncan hardly be considered as the same species. The one was established in\r\nChina, the other in Syria and in Anatolia. The peach, after being\r\ntransported from China into Central Asia, and a little before the\r\nChristian era into Western Asia, cannot, therefore, have produced the\r\nalmond, since the latter existed already in Syria. And if the almond of\r\nWestern Asia had produced the peach, how could the latter have existed\r\nin China at a very remote period while it was not known to the Greeks\r\nand Latins?\r\n\r\n\r\n+Pear+—_Pyrus communis_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe pear grows wild over the whole of temperate Europe and Western Asia,\r\nparticularly in Anatolia, to the south of the Caucasus and in the north\r\nof Persia,[1141] perhaps even in Kashmir,[1142] but this is very\r\ndoubtful. Some authors hold that its area extends as far as China. This\r\nopinion is due to the fact that they regard _Pyrus sinensis_, Lindley,\r\nas belonging to the same species. An examination of the leaves alone, of\r\nwhich the teeth are covered with a fine silky down, convinced me of the\r\nspecific difference of the two trees.[1143]\r\n\r\nOur wild pear does not differ much from some of the cultivated\r\nvarieties. Its fruit is sour, spotted, and narrowing towards the stalk,\r\nor nearly spherical on the same tree.[1144] With many other cultivated\r\nspecies, it is hard to distinguish the individuals of wild origin from\r\nthose which the chance transport of seeds has produced at a distance\r\nfrom dwellings. In the present case it is not difficult. Pear trees are\r\noften found in woods, and they attain to a considerable height, with all\r\nthe conditions of fertility of an indigenous plant.[1145] Let us\r\nexamine, however, whether in the wide area they occupy a less ancient\r\nexistence may be suspected in some countries than in others.\r\n\r\nNo Sanskrit name for the pear is known, whence it may be concluded that\r\nits cultivation is of no long standing in the north-west of India, and\r\nthat the indication, which is moreover very vague, of wild trees in\r\nKashmir is of no importance. Neither are there any Hebrew or Aramaic\r\nnames,[1146] but this is explained by the fact that the pear does not\r\nflourish in the hot countries in which these tongues were spoken.\r\n\r\nHomer, Theophrastus, and Dioscorides mention the pear tree under the\r\nnames _ochnai_, _apios_, or _achras_. The Latins called it _pyrus_ or\r\n_pirus_,[1147] and cultivated a great number of varieties, at least in\r\nPliny’s time. The mural paintings at Pompeii frequently represent the\r\ntree with its fruit.[1148]\r\n\r\nThe lake-dwellers of Switzerland and Italy gathered wild apples in great\r\nquantities, and among their stores pears are sometimes, but rarely,\r\nfound. Heer has given an illustration of one which cannot be mistaken,\r\nfound at Wangen or Robenhausen. It is a fruit narrowing towards the\r\nstalk, 28 mm. (about an inch and a half) long by 19 mm. (an inch) wide,\r\ncut longitudinally so as to show the small quantity of pulp as compared\r\nto the cartilaginous central part.[1149] None have been found in the\r\nlake-dwellings of Bourget in Savoy. In those of Lombardy, Professor\r\nRaggazzoni[1150] found a pear cut lengthways, 25 mm. by 16. This was at\r\nBardello, Lago di Varese. The wild pears figured in Duhamel, _Traité des\r\nArbres_, edit. 2, are 30 to 33 by 30 to 32 mm.; and those of Laristan,\r\nfigured in the _Jardin Fruitier du Muséum_ under the name _P. balansæ_,\r\nwhich seem to me to be of the same species, and undoubtedly wild, are 26\r\nto 27 mm. by 24 to 25. In modern wild pears the fleshy part is a little\r\nthicker, but the ancient lake-dwellers dried their fruits after cutting\r\nthem lengthways, which must have caused them to shrink a little. No\r\nknowledge of metals or of hemp is shown in the settlements where these\r\nwere found; but, considering their distance from the more civilized\r\ncentres of antiquity, especially in the case of Switzerland, it is\r\npossible that these remains are not more ancient than the Trojan war, or\r\nthan the foundation of Rome.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned three Greek and one Roman name, but there are many\r\nothers; for instance, _pauta_ in Armenian and Georgian; _vatzkor_ in\r\nHungarian; in Slav languages _gruscha_ (Russian), _hrusska_ (Bohemian),\r\n_kruska_ (Illyrian). Names similar to the Latin _pyrus_ recur in the\r\nKeltic languages; _peir_ in Erse, _per_ in Kymric and Armorican.[1151] I\r\nleave philologists to conjecture the Aryan origin of some of these\r\nnames, and of the German _Birn_; I merely note their number and\r\ndiversity as an indication of the very ancient existence of the species\r\nfrom the Caspian Sea to the Atlantic. The Aryans certainly did not carry\r\npears nor pear pips with them in their wanderings westward; but if they\r\nfound in Europe a fruit they knew, they would have given it the name or\r\nnames they were accustomed to use, while other earlier names may have\r\nsurvived in some countries. As an example of the latter case, I may\r\nmention two Basque names, _udarea_ and _madaria_,[1152] which have no\r\nanalogy with any known European or Asiatic name. The Basques being\r\nprobably the descendants of the conquered Iberians who were driven back\r\nto the Pyrenees by the Kelts, the antiquity of their language is very\r\ngreat, and it is clear that their names for the species in question were\r\nnot derived from Keltic or Latin.\r\n\r\nThe modern area of the pear extending from the north of Persia to the\r\nwestern coast of temperate Europe, principally in mountainous regions,\r\nmay therefore be considered as prehistoric, and anterior to all\r\ncultivation. It must be added, however, that in the north of Europe and\r\nin the British Isles an extensive cultivation must have extended and\r\nmultiplied naturalizations in comparatively modern times which can\r\nscarcely be now distinguished.\r\n\r\nI cannot accept Godron’s hypothesis that the numerous cultivated\r\nvarieties come from an unknown Asiatic species.[1153] It seems that they\r\nmay be ranked, as Decaisne says, either with _P. communis_ or _P.\r\nnivalis_ of which I am about to speak, taking into account the effect of\r\naccidental crossing, of cultivation, and of long-continued selection.\r\nBesides, Western Asia has been explored so thoroughly that it is\r\nprobable it contains no other species than those already described.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Snow Pear+—_Pyrus nivalis_, Jacquin.\r\n\r\nThis variety of pear is cultivated in Austria, in the north of Italy,\r\nand in several departments of the east and centre of France. It was\r\nnamed _Pyrus nivalis_ by Jacquin[1154] from the German name\r\n_Schneebirne_, given to it because the Austrian peasants eat the fruit\r\nwhen the snow is on the ground. It is called in France _Poirier sauger_,\r\nbecause the under side of the leaves is covered with a white down which\r\nmakes them like the sage (Fr. _sauge_). Decaisne[1155] considered all\r\nthe varieties of _P. nivalis_ to be derived from _P. kotschyana_,\r\nBoissier,[1156] which grows wild in Asia Minor. The latter in this case\r\nshould take the name of _nivalis_, which is the older.\r\n\r\nThe snowy pears cultivated in France to make the drink called perry have\r\nbecome wild in the woods here and there.[1157] They constitute the\r\ngreater number of the so-called “cider pears,” which are distinguished\r\nby the sour taste of the fruit independent of the character of the leaf.\r\nThe descriptions of the Greeks and Romans are too imperfect for us to be\r\ncertain if they possessed this species. It may be presumed that they\r\ndid, however, since they made cider.[1158]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Sandy Pear+, +Chinese Pear+—_Pyrus sinensis_, Lindley.[1159]\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned this species, which is nearly allied to the\r\ncommon pear. It is wild in Mongolia and Mantchuria,[1160] and cultivated\r\nin China and Japan. Its fruit, large rather than good, is used for\r\npreserving. It has also been recently introduced into European gardens\r\nfor experiments in crossing it with our species. This will very likely\r\ntake place naturally.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Apple+—_Pyrus Malus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe apple tree grows wild throughout Europe (excepting in the extreme\r\nnorth), in Anatolia, the south of the Caucasus, and the Persian province\r\nof Ghilan.[1161] Near Trebizond, the botanist Bourgeau saw quite a small\r\nforest of them.[1162] In the mountains of the north-west of India it is\r\n“apparently wild,” as Sir Joseph Hooker writes in his _Flora of British\r\nIndia_. No author mentions it as growing in Siberia, in Mongolia, or in\r\nJapan.[1163]\r\n\r\nThere are two varieties wild in Germany, the one with glabrous leaves\r\nand ovaries, the other with leaves downy on the under side, and Koch\r\nadds that this down varies considerably.[1164] In France accurate\r\nauthors also give two wild varieties, but with characters which do not\r\ntally exactly with those of the German flora.[1165] It would be easy to\r\naccount for this difference if the wild trees in certain districts\r\nspring from cultivated varieties whose seeds have been accidentally\r\ndispersed. The question is, therefore, to discover to what degree the\r\nspecies is probably ancient and indigenous in different countries, and,\r\nif it is not more ancient in one country than another, how it was\r\ngradually extended by the accidental sowing of forms changed by the\r\ncrossing of varieties and by cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe country in which the apple appears to be most indigenous is the\r\nregion lying between Trebizond and Ghilan. The variety which there grows\r\nwild has leaves downy on the under side, short peduncles, and sweet\r\nfruit,[1166] like _Malus communis_ of France, described by Boreau. This\r\nindicates that its prehistoric area extended from the Caspian Sea nearly\r\nto Europe.\r\n\r\nPiddington gives in his _Index_ a Sanskrit name for the apple, but\r\nAdolphe Pictet[1167] informs us that this name _seba_ is Hindustani, and\r\ncomes from the Persian _sêb_, _sêf_. The absence of an earlier name in\r\nIndia argues that the now common cultivation of the apple in Kashmir and\r\nThibet, and especially that in the north-west and central provinces of\r\nIndia, is not very ancient. The tree was probably known only to the\r\nwestern Aryans.\r\n\r\nThis people had in all probability a name of which the root was _ab_,\r\n_af_, _av_, _ob_, as this root recurs in several European names of Aryan\r\norigin. Pictet gives _aball_, _ubhall_, in Erse; _afal_ in Kymric;\r\n_aval_ in Armorican; _aphal_ in old High German; _appel_ in old English;\r\n_apli_ in Scandinavian; _obolys_ in Lithuanian; _iabluko_ in ancient\r\nSlav; _iabloko_ in Russian. It would appear from this that the western\r\nAryans, finding the apple wild or already naturalized in the north of\r\nEurope, kept the name under which they had known it. The Greeks had\r\n_mailea_ or _maila_, the Latins _malus_, _malum_, words whose origin,\r\naccording to Pictet, is very uncertain. The Albanians, descendants of\r\nthe Pelasgians, have _molé_.[1168] Theophrastus[1169] mentions wild and\r\ncultivated _maila_. Lastly, the Basques (ancient Iberians) have an\r\nentirely different name, _sagara_, which implies an existence in Europe\r\nprior to the Aryan invasions.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the _terra-mare_ of Parma, and of the palafittes of\r\nthe lakes of Lombardy, Savoy, and Switzerland, made great use of apples.\r\nThey always cut them lengthways, and preserved them dried as a provision\r\nfor the winter. The specimens are often carbonized by fire, but the\r\ninternal structure of the fruit is only the more clearly to be\r\ndistinguished. Heer,[1170] who has shown great penetration in observing\r\nthese details, distinguishes two varieties of the apple known to the\r\ninhabitants of the lake-dwellings before they possessed metals. The\r\nsmaller kind are 15 to 24 mm. in their longitudinal diameter, and about\r\n3 mm. more across (in their dried and carbonized state); the larger, 29\r\nto 32 mm. lengthways by 36 wide (dried, but not carbonized). The latter\r\ncorresponds to an apple of German-Swiss orchards, now called _campaner_.\r\nThe English wild apple, figured in _English Botany_, pl. 179, is 17 mm.\r\nlong by 22 wide. It is possible that the little apples of the\r\nlake-dwellings were wild; however, their abundance in the stores makes\r\nit doubtful. Dr. Gross sent me two apples from the more recent\r\npalafittes of Lake Neuchâtel; the one is 17 the other 22 mm. in\r\nlongitudinal diameter. At Lagozza, in Lombardy, Sordelli[1171] mentions\r\ntwo apples, the one 17 mm. by 19, the other 19 mm. by 27. In a\r\nprehistoric deposit of Lago Varese, at Bardello, Ragazzoni found an\r\napple in the stores a little larger than the others.\r\n\r\nFrom all these facts, I consider the apple to have existed in Europe,\r\nboth wild and cultivated, from prehistoric times. The lack of\r\ncommunication with Asia before the Aryan invasion makes it probable that\r\nthe tree was indigenous in Europe as in Anatolia, the south of the\r\nCaucasus, and Northern Russia, and that its cultivation began early\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Quince+—_Cydonia vulgaris_, Persoon.\r\n\r\nThe quince grows wild in the woods in the north of Persia, near the\r\nCaspian Sea, in the region to the south of the Caucasus, and in\r\nAnatolia.[1172] A few botanists have also found it apparently wild in\r\nthe Crimea, and in the north of Greece;[1173] but naturalization may be\r\nsuspected even in the east of Europe, and the further we advance towards\r\nItaly, especially towards the south-west of Europe and Algeria, the more\r\nit becomes probable that the species was naturalized at an early period\r\nround villages, in hedges, etc.\r\n\r\nNo Sanskrit name is known for the quince, whence it may be inferred that\r\nits area did not extend towards the centre of Asia. Neither is there any\r\nHebrew name, though the species is wild upon Mount Taurus.[1174] The\r\nPersian name is _haivah_,[1175] but I do not know whether it is as old\r\nas Zend. The same name, _aiva_, exists in Russian for the cultivated\r\nquince, while the name of the wild plant is _armud_, from the Armenian\r\n_armuda_.[1176] The Greeks grafted upon a common variety, _strution_, a\r\nsuperior kind, which came from Cydon, in Crete, whence κυδωνιον,\r\ntranslated by the Latin _malum cotoneum_, by _cydonia_, and all the\r\nEuropean names, such as _codogno_ in Italian, _coudougner_, and later\r\n_coing_ in French, _quitte_ in German, etc. There are Polish, _pigwa_,\r\nSlav, _tunja_,[1177] and Albanian (Pelasgian?), _ftua_,[1178] names\r\nwhich differ entirely from the others. This variety of names points to\r\nan ancient knowledge of the species to the west of its original\r\ncountry, and the Albanian name may even indicate an existence prior to\r\nthe Hellenes.\r\n\r\nIts antiquity in Greece may also be gathered from the superstition,\r\nmentioned by Pliny and Plutarch, that the fruit of the quince was a\r\npreservation from evil influences, and from its entrance into the\r\nmarriage rites prescribed by Solon. Some authors go so far as to\r\nmaintain that the apple disputed by Hera, Aphrodite, and Athene was a\r\nquince. Those who are interested in such questions will find details in\r\nComes’s paper on the plants represented in the frescoes at\r\nPompeii.[1179] The quince tree is figured twice in these, which is not\r\nsurprising, as the tree was known in Cato’s time.[1180]\r\n\r\nIt seems to me probable that it was naturalized in the east of Europe\r\nbefore the epoch of the Trojan war. The quince is a fruit which has been\r\nlittle modified by cultivation; it is as harsh and acid when fresh as in\r\nthe time of the ancient Greeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Pomegranate+—_Punica granatum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe pomegranate grows wild in stony ground in Persia, Kurdistan,\r\nAfghanistan, and Beluchistan.[1181] Burnes saw groves of it in\r\nMazanderan, to the south of the Caspian Sea.[1182] It appears equally\r\nwild to the south of the Caucasus.[1183] Westwards, that is to say, in\r\nAsia Minor, in Greece, and in the Mediterranean basin generally, in the\r\nnorth of Africa and in Madeira, the species appears rather to have\r\nbecome naturalized from cultivation, and by the dispersal of the seeds\r\nby birds. Many floras of the south of Europe speak of it as a\r\n“subspontaneous” or naturalized species. Desfontaines, in his _Atlantic\r\nFlora_, gives it as wild in Algeria, but subsequent authors think[1184]\r\nrather it is naturalized.[1185] I doubt its being wild in Beluchistan,\r\nwhere the traveller Stocks found it, for Anglo-Indian botanists do not\r\nallow it to be indigenous east of the Indus, and I note the absence of\r\nthe species in the collections from Lebanon and Syria which Boissier is\r\nalways careful to quote.\r\n\r\nIn China the pomegranate exists only as a cultivated plant. It was\r\nintroduced from Samarkhand by Chang-Kien, a century and a half before\r\nthe Christian era.[1186]\r\n\r\nThe naturalization in the Mediterranean basin is so general that it may\r\nbe termed an extension of the original area. It probably dates from a\r\nvery remote period, for the cultivation of the species dates from a very\r\nearly epoch in Western Asia.\r\n\r\nLet us see whether historical and philological data can give us any\r\ninformation on this head.\r\n\r\nI note the existence of a Sanskrit name, _darimba_, whence several\r\nmodern Indian names are derived.[1187] Hence we may conclude that the\r\nspecies had long been known in the regions traversed by the Aryans in\r\ntheir route towards India. The pomegranate is mentioned several times in\r\nthe Old Testament, under the name of _rimmon_,[1188] whence the Arabic\r\n_rumman_ or _rûman_. It was one of the fruit trees of the promised land,\r\nand the Hebrews had learnt to appreciate it in Egyptian gardens. Many\r\nlocalities in Palestine took their name from this shrub, but the\r\nScriptures only mention it as a cultivated species. The flower and the\r\nfruit figured in the religious rites of the Phœnicians, and the goddess\r\nAphrodite had herself planted it in the isle of Cyprus,[1189] which\r\nimplies that it was not indigenous there. The Greeks were acquainted\r\nwith the species in the time of Homer. It is twice mentioned in the\r\n_Odyssey_ as a tree in the gardens of Phæacia and Phrygia. They called\r\nit _roia_ or _roa_, which philologists believe to be derived from the\r\nSyrian and Hebrew name,[1190] and also _sidai_,[1191] which seems to be\r\nPelasgic, for the modern Albanian name is _sige_.[1192] There is nothing\r\nto show that the species was wild in Greece, where Fraas and Heldreich\r\naffirm that it is now only naturalized.[1193]\r\n\r\nThe pomegranate enters into the myths and religious ceremonies of the\r\nancient Romans.[1194] Cato speaks of its properties as a vermifuge.\r\nAccording to Pliny,[1195] the best pomegranates came from Carthage,\r\nhence the name _Malum punicum_; but it should not be supposed, as it has\r\nbeen assumed, that the species came originally from Northern Africa.\r\nVery probably the Phœnicians had introduced it at Carthage long before\r\nthe Romans had anything to do with this town, and it was doubtless\r\ncultivated as in Egypt.\r\n\r\nIf the pomegranate had formerly been wild in Northern Africa and the\r\nsouth of Europe, the Latins would have had more original names for it\r\nthan _granatum_ (from _granum?_) and _Malum punicum_. We should have\r\nperhaps found local names derived from ancient Western tongues; whereas\r\nthe Semitic name _rimmon_ has prevailed in Greek and in Arabic, and even\r\noccurs, through Arab influence, among the Berbers.[1196] It must be\r\nadmitted that the African origin is one of the errors caused by the\r\nerroneous popular nomenclature of the Romans.\r\n\r\nLeaves and flowers of a pomegranate, described by Saporta[1197] as a\r\nvariety of the modern _Punica granatum_, have been discovered in the\r\npliocene strata of the environs of Meximieux. The species, therefore,\r\nexisted under this form, before our epoch, along with several species,\r\nsome extinct, others still existing in the south of Europe, and others\r\nin the Canaries, but the continuity of existence down to our own day is\r\nnot thereby proved.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, botanical, historical, and philological data agree in\r\nshowing that the modern species is a native of Persia and some adjacent\r\ncountries. Its cultivation began in prehistoric time, and its early\r\nextension, first towards the west and afterwards into China, has caused\r\nits naturalization in cases which may give rise to errors as to its true\r\norigin, for they are frequent, ancient, and enduring. I arrived at these\r\nconclusions in 1869,[1198] which has not prevented the repetition of\r\nthe erroneous African origin in several works.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Rose Apple+—_Eugenia Jambos_, Linnæus; _Jambosa vulgaris_, de Candolle.\r\n\r\nThis small tree belongs to the family of Myrtaceæ. It is cultivated in\r\ntropical regions of the old and new worlds, as much perhaps for the\r\nbeauty of its foliage as for its fruit, of which the rose-scented pulp\r\nis too scanty. There is an excellent illustration and a good description\r\nof it in the _Botanical Magazine_, pl. 3356. The seed is\r\npoisonous.[1199]\r\n\r\nAs the cultivation of this species is of ancient date in Asia, there was\r\nno doubt of its Asiatic origin; but the locality in which it grew wild\r\nwas formerly unknown. Loureiro’s assertion that it grew in Cochin-China\r\nand some parts of India required confirmation, which has been afforded\r\nby some modern writers.[1200] The _jambos_ is wild in Sumatra, and\r\nelsewhere in the islands of the Malay Archipelago. Kurz did not meet\r\nwith it in the forests of British Burmah, but when Rheede saw this tree\r\nin gardens in Malabar he noticed that it was called _Malacca-schambu_,\r\nwhich shows that it came originally from the Malay Peninsula. Lastly,\r\nBrandis says it is wild in Sikkim, to the north of Bengal. Its natural\r\narea probably extends from the islands of the Malay Archipelago to\r\nCochin-China, and even to the north-east of India, where, however, it is\r\nprobably naturalized from cultivation and by the agency of birds.\r\nNaturalization has also taken place elsewhere—at Hongkong, for\r\ninstance, in the Seychelles, Mauritius, and Rodriguez, and in several of\r\nthe West India Islands.[1201]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Malay Apple+—_Eugenia malaccensis_, Linnæus; _Jambosa malaccensis_, de\r\nCandolle.\r\n\r\nA species allied to _Eugenia jambos_, but differing from it in the\r\narrangement of its flowers, and in its fruit, of an obovoid instead of\r\novoid form; that is to say, the smaller end is attached to the stalk.\r\nThe fruit is more fleshy and is also rose-scented, but it is much[1202]\r\nor little[1203] esteemed according to the country and varieties. These\r\nare numerous, differing in the red or pink colour of the flowers, and in\r\nthe size, shape, and colour of the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe numerous varieties show an ancient cultivation in the Malay\r\nArchipelago, where the species is indigenous. In confirmation, it must\r\nbe noted that Forster found it established in the Pacific Islands, from\r\nOtahiti to the Sandwich Isles, at the time of Cook’s voyages.[1204] The\r\nMalay apple grows wild in the forests of the Malay Archipelago, and in\r\nthe peninsula of Malacca.[1205]\r\n\r\nTussac says that it was brought to Jamaica from Otahiti in 1793. It has\r\nspread and become naturalized in several of the West India Islands, also\r\nin Mauritius and the Seychelles.[1206]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Guava+—_Psidium guayava_, Raddi.\r\n\r\nAncient authors, Linnæus, and some later botanists, admitted two species\r\nof this fruit tree of the family of Myrtaceæ, the one with elliptical or\r\nspherical fruit, with red flesh, _Psidium pomiferum_; the other with a\r\npyriform fruit and white or pink flesh, more agreeable to the taste.\r\nSuch diversity is also observed in pears, apples, or peaches; so it was\r\ndecided to consider all the Psidii as forming a single species. Raddi\r\nsaw a proof that there was no essential difference, for he observed\r\npyriform and round fruits growing on the same tree in Brazil.[1207] The\r\nmajority of botanists, especially those who have observed the guava in\r\nthe colonies, follow the opinion of Raddi,[1208] to which I was\r\ninclined, even in 1855, from reasons drawn from the geographical\r\ndistribution.[1209]\r\n\r\nLowe,[1210] in his _Flora of Madeira_, maintains with some hesitation\r\nthe distinction into two species, and asserts that each can be raised\r\nfrom seed. They are, therefore, races like those of our domestic\r\nanimals, and of many cultivated plants. Each of these races comprehends\r\nseveral varieties.[1211]\r\n\r\nThe study of the origin of the guava presents in the highest degree the\r\ndifficulty which exists in the case of many fruit trees of this nature:\r\ntheir fleshy and somewhat aromatic fruits attract omnivorous animals\r\nwhich cast their seeds in places far from cultivation. Those of the\r\nguava germinate rapidly, and fructify in the third or fourth year. Its\r\narea has thus spread, and is still spreading by naturalization,\r\nprincipally in those tropical countries which are neither very hot nor\r\nvery damp.\r\n\r\nIn order to simplify the search after the origin of the species, I may\r\nbegin by eliminating the old world, for it is sufficiently evident that\r\nthe guava came from America. Out of sixty species of the genus Psidium,\r\nall those which have been carefully studied are American. It is true\r\nthat botanists from the sixteenth century have found plants of _Psidium\r\nguayava_ (varieties _pomiferum_ and _pyriferum_) more or less wild in\r\nthe Malay Archipelago and the south of Asia,[1212] but everything tends\r\nto show that these were the result of recent naturalization. In each\r\nlocality a foreign origin was admitted; the only doubt was whether this\r\norigin was Asiatic or American. Other considerations justify this idea.\r\nThe common names in Malay are derived from the American word _guiava_.\r\nAncient Chinese authors do not mention the guava, though Loureiro said a\r\ncentury and a half ago that they were growing wild in Cochin-China.\r\nForster does not mention them among the cultivated plants of the Pacific\r\nIsles at the time of Cook’s voyage, which is significant when we\r\nconsider how easy this plant is to cultivate and its ready dispersion.\r\nIn Mauritius and the Seychelles there is no doubt of their recent\r\nintroduction and naturalization.[1213]\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to discover from what part of America the guava\r\noriginally came. In the present century it is undoubtedly wild in the\r\nWest Indies, in Mexico, in Central America, Venezuela, Peru, Guiana, and\r\nBrazil.[1214] But whether this is only since Europeans extended its\r\ncultivation, or whether it was previously diffused by the agency of the\r\nnatives and of birds, seems to be no more certain than when I spoke on\r\nthe subject in 1855.[1215] Now, however, with a little more experience\r\nin questions of this nature, and since the specific unity of the two\r\nvarieties of guava is recognized, I shall endeavour to show what seems\r\nmost probable.\r\n\r\nJ. Acosta,[1216] one of the earliest authors on the natural history of\r\nthe new world, expresses himself as follows, about the spherical variety\r\nof the guava: “There are mountains in San Domingo and the other islands\r\nentirely covered with guavas, and the natives say that there were no\r\nsuch trees in the islands before the arrival of the Spaniards, who\r\nbrought them, I know not whence.” The mainland seems, therefore, to have\r\nbeen the original home of the species. Acosta says that it grows in\r\nSouth America, adding that the Peruvian guavas have a white flesh\r\nsuperior to that of the red fruit. This argues an ancient cultivation on\r\nthe mainland. Hernandez[1217] saw both varieties wild in Mexico in the\r\nwarm regions of the plains and mountains near Quauhnaci. He gives a\r\ndescription and a fair drawing of _P. pomiferum_. Piso and\r\nMarcgraf[1218] also found the two guavas wild in the plains of Brazil;\r\nbut they remark that it spreads readily. Marcgraf says that they were\r\nbelieved to be natives of Peru or of North America, by which he may mean\r\nthe West Indies or Mexico. Evidently the species was wild in a great\r\npart of the continent at the time of the discovery of America. If the\r\narea was at one time more restricted, it must have been at a far more\r\nremote epoch.\r\n\r\nDifferent common names were given by the different native races. In\r\nMexico it was _xalxocotl_; in Brazil the tree was called _araca-iba_,\r\nthe fruit _araca guacu_; lastly, the name _guajavos_, or _guajava_, is\r\nquoted by Acosta and Hernandez for the guavas of Peru and San Domingo\r\nwithout any precise indication of origin. This diversity of names\r\nconfirms the hypothesis of a very ancient and extended area.\r\n\r\nFrom what ancient travellers say of an origin foreign to San Domingo and\r\nBrazil (an assertion, however, which we may be permitted to doubt), I\r\nsuspect that the most ancient habitation extended from Mexico to\r\nColumbia and Peru, possibly including Brazil before the discovery of\r\nAmerica, and the West Indies after that event. In its earliest state,\r\nthe species bore spherical, highly coloured fruit, harsh to the taste.\r\nThe other form is perhaps the result of cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Gourd+,[1219] or +Calabash+—_Lagenaria vulgaris_, Seringe; _Cucurbita\r\nlagenaria_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of this _Curcubitacea_ has taken different forms in\r\ncultivation, but from a general observation of the other parts of the\r\nplant, botanists have ranked them in one species which comprises several\r\nvarieties.[1220] The most remarkable are the _pilgrim’s gourd_, in the\r\nform of a bottle, the _long-necked gourd_, the _trumpet gourd_, and the\r\n_calabash_, generally large and without a neck. Other less common\r\nvarieties have a flattened, very small fruit, like the _snuff-box\r\ngourd_. The species may always be recognized by its white flower, and by\r\nthe hardness of the outer rind of the fruit, which allows of its use as\r\na vessel for liquids, or a reservoir of air suitable as a buoy for\r\nnovices in swimming. The flesh is sometimes sweet and eatable, sometimes\r\nbitter and even purgative.\r\n\r\nLinnæus[1221] pronounced the species to be American. De Candolle[1222]\r\nthought it was probably of Indian origin, and this opinion has since\r\nbeen confirmed.\r\n\r\n_Lagenaria vulgaris_ has been found wild on the coast of Malabar and in\r\nthe humid forests of Deyra Doon.[1223] Roxburgh[1224] considered it to\r\nbe wild in India, although subsequent floras give it only as a\r\ncultivated species. Lastly, Rumphius[1225] mentions wild plants of it on\r\nthe sea-shore in one of the Moluccas. Authors generally note that the\r\npulp is bitter in these wild plants, but this is sometimes the case in\r\ncultivated forms. The Sanskrit language already distinguished the common\r\ngourd, _ulavou_, and another, bitter, _kutou-toumbi_, to which Pictet\r\nalso attributes the name _tiktaka_ or _tiktika_.[1226] Seemann[1227] saw\r\nthe species cultivated and naturalized in the Fiji Isles. Thozet\r\ngathered it on the coast of Queensland,[1228] but it had perhaps spread\r\nfrom neighbouring cultivation. The localities in continental India seem\r\nmore certain and more numerous than those of the islands to the south of\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nThe species has also been found wild in Abyssinia, in the valley of\r\nHieha by Dillon, and in the bush and stony ground of another district by\r\nSchimper.[1229]\r\n\r\nFrom these two regions of the old world it has been introduced into the\r\ngardens of all tropical countries and of those temperate ones where\r\nthere is a sufficiently high temperature in summer. It has occasionally\r\nbecome naturalized from cultivation, as is seen in America.[1230]\r\n\r\nThe earliest Chinese work which mentioned the gourd is that of\r\nTchong-tchi-chou, of the first century before Christ, quoted in a work\r\nof the fifth or sixth century according to Bretschneider.[1231] He is\r\nspeaking here of cultivated plants. The modern varieties of the gardens\r\nat Pekin are the trumpet gourd, which is eatable, and the bottle gourd.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreek authors do not mention the plant, but Romans speak of it from the\r\nbeginning of the empire. It is clearly alluded to in the often-quoted\r\nlines[1232] of the tenth book of Columella. After describing the\r\ndifferent forms of the fruit, he says—\r\n\r\n                     “Dabit illa capacem,\r\n   Nariciæ picis, aut Actæi mellis Hymetti,\r\n   Aut habilem lymphis hamulam, Bacchove lagenam,\r\n   Tum pueros eadem fluviis innare docebit.”\r\n\r\nPliny[1233] speaks of a _Cucurbitacea_, of which vessels and flasks for\r\nwine were made, which can only apply to this species.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the Arabs were early acquainted with it, for Ibn\r\nAlawâm and Ibn Baithar say nothing of it.[1234] Commentators of Hebrew\r\nworks attribute no name to this species with certainty, and yet the\r\nclimate of Palestine is such as to popularize the use of gourds had they\r\nbeen known. From this it seems to me doubtful that the ancient Egyptians\r\npossessed this plant, in spite of a single figure of leaves observed on\r\na tomb which has been sometimes identified with it.[1235] Alexander\r\nBraun, Ascherson, and Magnus, in their learned paper on the Egyptian\r\nremains of plants in the Berlin Museum,[1236] indicate several\r\nCucurbitaceæ without mentioning this one. The earliest modern\r\ntravellers, such as Rauwolf,[1237] in 1574, saw it in the gardens of\r\nSyria, and the so-called pilgrim’s gourd, figured in 1539 by Brunfels,\r\nwas probably known in the Holy Land from the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nAll the botanists of the sixteenth century give illustrations of this\r\nspecies, which was more generally cultivated in Europe at that time than\r\nit is now. The common name in these older writings is _Cameraria_, and\r\nthree kinds of fruit are distinguished. From the white colour of the\r\nflower, which is always mentioned, there can be no doubt of the species.\r\nI also note an illustration, certainly a very indifferent one, in which\r\nthe flower is wanting, but with an exact representation of the fruit of\r\nthe pilgrim’s gourd, which has the great interest of having appeared\r\nbefore the discovery of America. It is pl. 216 of _Herbarius Pataviæ\r\nImpressus_, in 4to, 1485—a rare work.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the use of similar names by some authors, I do not believe\r\nthat the gourd existed in America before the arrival of the Europeans.\r\nThe _Taquera_ of Piso[1238] and _Cucurbita lagenæforma_ of\r\nMarcgraf[1239] are perhaps _Lagenaria vulgaris_ as monographs say,[1240]\r\nand the specimens from Brazil which they mention should be certain, but\r\nthat does not prove that the species was in the country before the\r\nvoyage of Amerigo Vespucci in 1504. From that time until the voyages of\r\nthese two botanists in 1637 and 1638, a much longer time elapsed than is\r\nneeded to account for the introduction and diffusion of an annual\r\nspecies of a curious form, easy of cultivation, and of which the seeds\r\nlong retain the faculty of germination. It may have become naturalized\r\nfrom cultivation, as has taken place elsewhere. It is still more likely\r\nthat _Cucurbita siceratia_, Molina, attributed sometimes to the species\r\nunder consideration, sometimes to _Cucurbita maxima_,[1241] may have\r\nbeen introduced into Chili between 1538, the date of the discovery of\r\nthat country, and 1787, the date of the Italian edition of Molina.\r\nAcosta[1242] also speaks of calabashes which the Peruvians used as cups\r\nand vases, but the Spanish edition of his book appeared in 1591, more\r\nthan a hundred years after the Conquest. Among the first naturalists to\r\nmention the species after the discovery of America (1492) is\r\nOviedo,[1243] who had visited the mainland, and, after dwelling at Vera\r\nPaz, came back to Europe in 1515, but returned to Nicaragua in\r\n1539.[1244] According to Ramusio’s compilation[1245] he spoke of\r\n_zueche_, freely cultivated in the West India Islands and Nicaragua at\r\nthe time of the discovery of America, and used as bottles. The authors\r\nof the floras of Jamaica in the seventeenth century say that the species\r\nwas cultivated in that island. P. Brown,[1246] however, mentions a large\r\ncultivated gourd, and a smaller one with a bitter and purgative pulp,\r\nwhich was found wild.\r\n\r\nLastly, Elliott[1247] writes as follows, in 1824, in a work on the\r\nSouthern States of America: “_L. vulgaris_ is rarely found in the woods,\r\nand is certainly not indigenous. It seems to have been brought by the\r\nearly inhabitants of our country from a warmer climate. The species has\r\nnow become wild near dwellings, especially in islands.” The expression,\r\n“inhabitants of our country,” seems to refer rather to the colonists\r\nthan to the natives. Between the discovery of Virginia by Cabot in 1497,\r\nor the travels of Raleigh in 1584, and the floras of modern botanists,\r\nmore than two centuries elapsed, and the natives would have had time to\r\nextend the cultivation of the species if they had received it from\r\nEuropeans. But the fact of its cultivation by Indians at the time of the\r\nearliest dealings with them is doubtful. Torrey and Gray[1248] mentioned\r\nit as certain in their flora published in 1830-40, and later the second\r\nof these able botanists,[1249] in an article on the _Cucurbitaceæ_ known\r\nto the natives, does not mention the calabash, or _Lagenaria_. I remark\r\nthe same omission in another special article on the same subject,\r\npublished more recently.[1250]\r\n\r\n[In the learned articles by Messrs. Asa Gray and Trumbull on the present\r\nvolume (_American Journal of Science_, 1883, p. 370), they give reasons\r\nfor supposing the species known and indigenous in America previous to\r\nthe arrival of the Europeans. Early travellers are quoted more in detail\r\nthan I had done. From their testimony it appears that the inhabitants of\r\nPeru, Brazil, and of Paria possessed gourds, in Spanish _calabazas_, but\r\nI do not see that this proves that this was the species called by\r\nbotanists _Cucurbita lagmaria_. The only character independent of the\r\nexceedingly variable form of the fruit is the white colour of the\r\nflowers, and this character is not mentioned.—AUTHOR’S NOTE, 1884.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Gourd+—_Cucurbita maxima_, Duchesne.\r\n\r\nIn enumerating the species of the genus _Cucurbita_, I should explain\r\nthat their distinction, formerly exceedingly difficult, has been\r\nestablished by M. Naudin[1251] in a very scientific manner, by means of\r\nan assiduous cultivation of varieties and of experiments upon their\r\ncrossed fertilization. Those groups of forms which cannot fertilize each\r\nother, or of which the product is not fertile and stable, are regarded\r\nby him as species, and the forms which can be crossed and yield a\r\nfertile and varied product, as races, breeds, or varieties. Later\r\nexperiments[1252] showed him that the establishment of species on this\r\nbasis is not without exceptions, but in the genus _Cucurbita_\r\nphysiological facts agree with exterior differences. M. Naudin has\r\nestablished the true distinctive characters of _C. maxima_ and _C.\r\nPepo_. The leaves of the first have rounded lobes, the peduncles are\r\nsmooth and the lobes of the corolla are curved outwards; the second has\r\nleaves with pointed lobes, the peduncles marked with ridges and furrows,\r\nthe corolla narrowed towards the base and with lobes nearly always\r\nupright.\r\n\r\nThe principal varieties of _Cucurbita maxima_ are the great yellow\r\ngourd, which sometimes attains to an enormous size,[1253] the Spanish\r\ngourd, the turban gourd, etc.\r\n\r\nSince common names and those in ancient authors do not agree with\r\nbotanical definitions, we must mistrust the assertions formerly put\r\nforth on the origin and early cultivation of such and such a gourd at a\r\ngiven epoch in a given country. For this reason, when I considered the\r\nsubject in 1855, the home of these plants seemed to me either unknown or\r\nvery doubtful. At the present day it is more easy to investigate the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir Joseph Hooker,[1254] _Cucurbita maxima_ was found by\r\nBarter on the banks of the Niger in Guinea, apparently indigenous, and\r\nby Welwitsch in Angola without any assertion of its wild character. In\r\nworks on Abyssinia, Egypt, or other African countries in which the\r\nspecies is commonly cultivated, I find no indication that it is found\r\nwild. The Abyssinians used the word _dubba_, which is applied in Arabic\r\nto gourds in general.\r\n\r\nThe plant was long supposed to be of Indian origin, because of such\r\nnames as Indian gourd, given by sixteenth-century botanists, and in\r\nparticular the _Pepo maximus indicus_, figured by Lobel,[1255] which\r\nanswers to the modern species; but this is a very insufficient proof,\r\nsince popular indications of origin are very often erroneous. The fact\r\nis that though pumpkins are cultivated in Southern Asia, as in other\r\nparts of the tropics, the plant has not been found wild.[1256] No\r\nsimilar species is indicated by ancient Chinese authors, and the modern\r\nnames of gourds and pumpkins now grown in China are of foreign and\r\nsouthern origin.[1257] It is impossible to know to what species the\r\nSanskrit name _kurkarou_ belonged, although Roxburgh attributes it to\r\n_Cucurbita Pepo_; and there is no less uncertainty with respect to the\r\ngourds, pumpkins, and melons cultivated by the Greeks and Romans. It is\r\nnot certain if the species was known to the ancient Egyptians, but\r\nperhaps it was cultivated in that country and in the Græco-Roman world.\r\nThe _Pepones_, of which Charlemagne commanded the cultivation in his\r\nfarms,[1258] were perhaps some kind of pumpkin or marrow, but no figure\r\nor description of these plants which may be clearly recognized exists\r\nearlier than the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThis tends to show its American origin. Its existence in Africa in a\r\nwild state is certainly an argument to the contrary, for the species of\r\nthe family of _Cucurbitaceæ_ are very local; but there are arguments in\r\nfavour of America, and I must examine them with the more care since I\r\nhave been reproached in the United States for not having given them\r\nsufficient weight.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, out of the ten known species of the genus\r\n_Cucurbita_, six are certainly wild in America (Mexico and California);\r\nbut these are perennial species, while the cultivated pumpkins are\r\nannuals.\r\n\r\nThe plant called _jurumu_ by the Brazilians, figured by Piso and\r\nMarcgraf[1259] is attributed by modern writers to _Cucurbita maxima_.\r\nThe drawing and the short account by the two authors agree pretty well\r\nwith this theory, but it seems to have been a cultivated plant. It may\r\nhave been brought from Europe or from Africa by Europeans, between the\r\ndiscovery of Brazil in 1504, and the travels of the above-named authors\r\nin 1637 and 1638. No one has found the species wild in North or South\r\nAmerica. I cannot find in works on Brazil, Guiana, or the West Indies\r\nany sign of an ancient cultivation or of wild growth, either from names,\r\nor from traditions or more or less distinct belief. In the United States\r\nthose men of science who best know the languages and customs of the\r\nnatives, Dr. Harris for instance, and more recently Trumbull,[1260]\r\nmaintain that the _Cucurbitaceæ_ called _squash_ by the Anglo-Americans,\r\nand _macock_, or _cashaw_, _cushaw_, by early travellers in Virginia,\r\nare _pumpkins_. Trumbull says that _squash_ is an Indian word. I have no\r\nreason to doubt the assertion, but neither the ablest linguists, nor\r\nthe travellers of the seventeenth century, who saw the natives provided\r\nwith fruits which they called _gourds and pumpkins_, have been able to\r\nprove that they were such and such species recognized as distinct by\r\nmodern botanists. All that we learn from this is that the natives a\r\ncentury after the discovery of Virginia, and twenty to forty years after\r\nits colonization by Sir Walter Raleigh, made use of some fruits of the\r\n_Cucurbitaceæ_. The common names are still so confused in the United\r\nStates, that Dr. Asa Gray, in 1868, gives _pumpkin_ and _squash_ as\r\nanswering to different species of _Cucurbita_,[1261] while\r\nDarlington[1262] attributes the name _pumpkin_ to the common _Cucurbita\r\nPepo_, and that of _squash_ to the varieties of the latter which\r\ncorrespond to the forms of _Melopepo_ of early botanists. They attribute\r\nno distinct common name to _Cucurbita maxima_.\r\n\r\nFinally, without placing implicit faith in the indigenous character of\r\nthe plant on the banks of the Niger, based upon the assertion of a\r\nsingle traveller, I still believe that the species is a native of the\r\nold world, and introduced into America by Europeans.\r\n\r\n[The testimony of early travellers touching the existence of _Cucurbita\r\nmaxima_ in America before the arrival of Europeans has been collected\r\nand supplemented by Messrs. Asa Gray and Trumbull (_American Journal of\r\nScience_, 1883, p. 372). They confirm the fact already known, that the\r\nnatives cultivated species of _Cucurbita_ under American names, of which\r\nsome remain in the modern idiom of the United States. None of these\r\nearly travellers has noted the botanical characters by which Naudin\r\nestablished the distinction between _C. maxima_ and _C. Pepo_, and\r\nconsequently it is still doubtful to which species they referred. For\r\nvarious reasons I had already admitted that _C. Pepo_ was of American\r\norigin, but I retain my doubts about _C. maxima_. After a more attentive\r\nperusal of Tragus and Matthiolo than I had bestowed upon them, Asa Gray\r\nand Trumbull notice that they call _Indian_ whatever came from America.\r\nBut if these two botanists did not confound the East and West Indies,\r\nseveral others, and the public in general, did make this confusion,\r\nwhich occasioned errors touching the origin of species which botanists\r\nwere liable to repeat. A further indication in favour of the American\r\norigin of _C. maxima_ is communicated by M. Wittmack, who informs me\r\nthat seeds, certified by M. Naudin to belong to this species, have been\r\nfound in the tombs of Ancon. This would be conclusive if the date of the\r\nlatest burials at Ancon were certain. See on this head the article on\r\n_Phaseolus vulgaris_.—AUTHOR’S NOTE, 1884.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Pumpkin+—_Cucurbita Pepo_ and _C. Melopepo_, Linnæus. Modern authors\r\ninclude under the head of _Cucurbita Pepo_ most of the varieties which\r\nLinnæus designated by this name, and also those which he called _C.\r\nMelopepo_. These varieties are very different as to the shape of the\r\nfruit, which shows a very ancient cultivation. There is the Patagonian\r\npumpkin, with enormous cylindrical fruit; the _sugared pumpkin_, called\r\nBrazilian; the vegetable marrow, with smaller long-shaped fruit; the\r\n_Barberine_, with knobby fruit; the _Elector’s hat_, with a curiously\r\nshaped conical fruit, etc. No value should be attached to the local\r\nnames in this designation of varieties, for we have often seen that they\r\nexpress as many errors as varieties. The botanical names attributed to\r\nthe species by Naudin and Cogniaux are numerous, on account of the bad\r\nhabit which existed not long ago of describing as species purely garden\r\nvarieties, without taking into account the wonderful effects of\r\ncultivation and selection upon the organ for the sake of which the plant\r\nis cultivated.\r\n\r\nMost of these varieties exist in the gardens of the warm and temperate\r\nregions of both hemispheres. The origin of the species is considered to\r\nbe doubtful. I hesitated in 1855[1263] between Southern Asia and the\r\nMediterranean basin. Naudin and Cogniaux[1264] admit Southern Asia as\r\nprobable, and the botanists of the United States on their side have\r\ngiven reasons for their belief in an American origin. The question\r\nrequires careful investigation.\r\n\r\nI shall first seek for those forms now attributed to the species which\r\nhave been found growing anywhere in a wild state.\r\n\r\nThe variety _Cucurbita ovifera_, Linnæus, was formerly gathered by\r\nLerche, near Astrakhan, but no modern botanist has confirmed this fact,\r\nand it is probable it was a cultivated plant. Moreover, Linnæus does not\r\nassert it was wild. I have consulted all the Asiatic and African floras\r\nwithout finding the slightest mention of a wild variety. From Arabia, or\r\neven from the coast of Guinea to Japan, the species, or the varieties\r\nattributed to it, are always said to be cultivated. In India, Roxburgh\r\nremarked this, and certainly Clarke, in his recent flora of British\r\nIndia, has good reasons for indicating no locality for it outside\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nIt is otherwise in America. A variety, _C. texana_,[1265] very near to\r\nthe variety _ovata_, according to Asa Gray, and which is now\r\nunhesitatingly attributed to _C. Pepo_, was found by Lindheimer “on the\r\nedges of thickets, in damp woods, on the banks of the upper Guadaloupe,\r\napparently an indigenous plant.” Asa Gray adds, however, that it is\r\nperhaps the result of naturalization. However, as several species of the\r\ngenus _Cucurbita_ grow wild in Mexico and in the south-west of the\r\nUnited States, we are naturally led to consider the collector’s opinion\r\nsound. It does not appear that other botanists found this plant in\r\nMexico, or in the United States. It is not mentioned in Hemsley’s\r\n_Biologia Centrali-Americana_, nor in Asa Gray’s recent flora of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nSome synonyms or specimens from South America, attributed to _C. Pepo_,\r\nappear to me very doubtful. It is impossible to say what Molina[1266]\r\nmeant by the names _C. Siceratia_ and _C. mammeata_, which appear,\r\nmoreover, to have been cultivated plants. Two species briefly described\r\nin the account of the journey of Spix and Martius (ii. p. 536), and also\r\nattributed to _C. Pepo_,[1267] are mentioned among cultivated plants on\r\nthe banks of the Rio Francisco. Lastly, the specimen of Spruce, 2716,\r\nfrom the river Uaupes, a tributary of the Rio Negro, which\r\nCogniaux[1268] does not mention having seen, and which he first\r\nattributed to the _C. Pepo_, and afterwards to the _C. moschata_, was\r\nperhaps cultivated or naturalized from cultivation, or by transport, in\r\nspite of the paucity of inhabitants in this country.\r\n\r\nBotanical indications are, therefore, in favour of a Mexican or Texan\r\norigin. It remains to be seen if historical records are in agreement\r\nwith or contrary to this idea.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to discover whether a given Sanskrit, Greek, or Latin\r\nname for the pumpkin belongs to one species rather than to another. The\r\nform of the fruit is often the same, and the distinctive characters are\r\nnever mentioned by authors.\r\n\r\nThere is no figure of the pumpkin in the _Herbarius Pataviæ Impressus_\r\nof 1485, before the discovery of America, but sixteenth-century authors\r\nhave published plates which may be attributed to it. There are three\r\nforms of _Pepones_ figured on page 406 of Dodoens, edition 1557. A\r\nfourth, _Pepo rotundus major_, added in the edition of 1616, appears to\r\nme to be _C. maxima_. In the drawing of _Pepo oblongus_ of Lobel,\r\n_Icones_, 641, the character of the peduncle is clearly defined. The\r\nnames given to these plants imply a foreign origin; but the authors\r\ncould make no assertions on this head, all the more that the name of\r\n“the Indies” applied both to Southern Asia and America.\r\n\r\nThus historical data do not gainsay the opinion of an American origin,\r\nbut neither do they adduce anything in support of it.\r\n\r\nIf the belief that it grows wild in America is confirmed, it may be\r\nconfidently asserted that the pumpkins cultivated by the Romans and in\r\nthe Middle Ages were _Cucurbita maxima_, and those of the natives of\r\nNorth America, seen by different travellers in the seventeenth century,\r\nwere _Cucurbita Pepo_.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Musk+, or +Melon Pumpkin+—_Cucurbita moschata_, Duchesne.\r\n\r\nThe _Bon Jardinier_ quotes as the principal varieties of this species\r\npumpkin _muscade de Provence_, _pleine de Naples_, and _de Barbarie_. It\r\nis needless to say that these names show nothing as to origin. The\r\nspecies is easily recognized by its fine soft down, the pentagonal\r\npeduncle which supports the fruit broadening at the summit; the fruit is\r\nmore or less covered with a glaucous efflorescence, and the flesh is\r\nsomewhat musk-scented. The lobes of the calyx are often terminated by a\r\nleafy border.[1269] Cultivated in all tropical countries, it is less\r\nsuccessful than other pumpkins in temperate regions.\r\n\r\nCogniaux[1270] suspects that it comes from the south of Asia, but he\r\ngives no proof of this. I have searched through the floras of the old\r\nand new worlds, and I have nowhere been able to discover the mention of\r\nthe species in a truly wild state. The indications which approach most\r\nnearly to it are: (1) In Asia, in the island of Bangka, a specimen\r\nverified by Cogniaux, and which Miquel[1271] says is not cultivated; (2)\r\nin Africa, in Angola, specimens which Welwitsch says are quite wild, but\r\n“probably due to an introduction;” (3) in America, five specimens from\r\nBrazil, Guiana, or Nicaragua, mentioned by Cogniaux, without knowing\r\nwhether they were cultivated, naturalized, or indigenous. These\r\nindications are very slight. Rumphius, Blume, Clarke (_Flora of British\r\nIndia_) in Asia, Schweinfurth (Oliver’s _Flora of Trop. Africa_) in\r\nAfrica, only know it as a cultivated plant. Its cultivation is recent in\r\nChina,[1272] and American floras rarely mention the species.\r\n\r\nNo Sanskrit name is known, and the Indian, Malay, and Chinese names are\r\nneither very numerous nor very original, although the cultivation of the\r\nplant seems to be more diffused in Southern Asia than in other parts of\r\nthe tropics. It was already grown in the seventeenth century according\r\nto the _Hortus Malabaricus_, in which there is a good plate (vol. viii.\r\npl. 2). It does not appear that this species was known in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, for Dalechamp’s illustration (_Hist._, i. p. 616) which Seringe\r\nattributed to it has not its true characters, and I can find no other\r\nfigure which resembles it.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Fig-leaved Pumpkin+—_Cucurbita ficifolia_, Bouché; _Cucurbita\r\nmelanosperma_, Braun.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years ago this pumpkin with black or brown seeds was\r\nintroduced into gardens. It differs from other cultivated species in\r\nbeing perennial. It is sometimes called the _Siamese melon_. The _Bon\r\nJardinier_ says that it comes from China. Dr. Bretschneider does not\r\nmention it in his letter of 1881, in which he enumerates the pumpkins\r\ngrown by the Chinese.\r\n\r\nHitherto no botanist has found it wild. I very much doubt its Asiatic\r\norigin as all the known perennial species of _Cucurbita_ are from Mexico\r\nor California.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Melon+—_Cucumis Melo_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the question as to the origin of the melon has completely\r\nchanged since the experiments of Naudin. The paper which he published in\r\n1859, in the _Annales des Sciences Naturelles_, 4th series, vol. ii., on\r\nthe genus _Cucumis_, is as remarkable as that on the genus _Cucurbita_.\r\nHe gives an account of the observations and experiments of several years\r\non the variability of forms and the crossed fecundation of a multitude\r\nof species, breeds, or varieties coming from all parts of the world. I\r\nhave already spoken (p. 250) of the physiological principle on which he\r\nbelieves it possible to distinguish those groups of forms which he terms\r\nspecies, although certain exceptions have occurred which render the\r\ncriterion of fertilization less absolute. In spite of these exceptional\r\ncases, it is evident that if nearly allied forms can be easily crossed\r\nand produce fertile individuals, as we see, for example, in the human\r\nspecies, they must be considered as constituting a single species.\r\n\r\nIn this sense _Cucumis Melo_, according to the experiments and\r\nobservations made by Naudin upon about two thousand living plants,\r\nconstitutes a species which comprehends an extraordinary number of\r\nvarieties and even of breeds; that is to say, forms which are preserved\r\nby heredity. These varieties or races can be fertilized by each other,\r\nand yield varied and variable products. They are classed by the author\r\ninto ten groups, which he calls _canteloups_, _melons brodés_,\r\n_sucrins_, _melons d’hiver_, _serpents_, _forme de concombre_, _Chito_,\r\n_Dudaim_, _rouges de Perse_, and _sauvages_, each containing varieties\r\nor nearly allied races. These have been named in twenty-five or thirty\r\ndifferent ways by botanists, who, without noticing transitions of form,\r\nthe faculty of crossing or of change under cultivation, have\r\ndistinguished as species all the varieties which occur in a given time\r\nor place.\r\n\r\nHence it results that several forms found wild, and which have been\r\ndescribed as species, must be the types and sources of the cultivated\r\nforms; and Naudin makes the very just observation that these wild forms,\r\nwhich differ more or less the one from the other, may have produced\r\ndifferent cultivated varieties. This is the more probable that they\r\nsometimes inhabit countries remote from each other as Southern Asia and\r\ntropical Africa, so that differences in climate and isolation may have\r\ncreated and consolidated varieties.\r\n\r\nThe following are the forms which Naudin enumerates as wild: 1. Those of\r\nIndia, which are named by Wildenow _Cucumis pubescens_, and by Roxburgh\r\n_C. turbinatus_ or _C. maderas-patanus_. The whole of British India and\r\nBeluchistan is their natural area. Its natural wildness is evident even\r\nto non-botanical travellers.[1273] The fruit varies from the size of a\r\nplum to that of a lemon. It is either striped or barred, or all one\r\ncolour, scented or odourless. The flesh is sweet, insipid, or slightly\r\nacid, differences which it has in common with the cultivated Cantelopes.\r\nAccording to Roxburgh the Indians gather and have a taste for the fruits\r\nof _C. turbinatus_ and of _C. maderas-patanus_, though they do not\r\ncultivate it.\r\n\r\nReferring to the most recent flora of British India, in which Clarke has\r\ndescribed the _Cucurbitaceæ_ (ii. p. 619), it seems that this author\r\ndoes not agree with M. Naudin about the Indian wild forms, although both\r\nhave examined the numerous specimens in the herbarium at Kew. The\r\ndifference of opinion, more apparent than real, arises from the fact\r\nthat the English author attributes to a nearly and certainly wild allied\r\nspecies, _C. trigonus_, Roxburgh, the varieties which Naudin classes\r\nunder _C. Melo_. Cogniaux,[1274] who afterwards saw the same specimens,\r\nattributes only _C. turbinatus_ to _trigonus_. The specific difference\r\nbetween _C. Melo_ and _C. trigonus_ is unfortunately obscure, from the\r\ncharacters given by these three authors. The principal difference is\r\nthat _C. Melo_ is an annual, the other perennial, but this duration does\r\nnot appear to be very constant. Mr. Clarke says himself that _C. Melo_\r\nis perhaps derived by cultivation from _C. trigonus_; that is to say,\r\naccording to him, from the forms which Naudin attributes to _C. Melo_.\r\n\r\nThe experiments made during three consecutive years by Naudin[1275] upon\r\nthe products of _Cucumis trigonus_, fertilized by _C. Melo_, seem in\r\nfavour of the opinion which admits a specific diversity; for if\r\nfertilization took place the products were of different forms, and often\r\nreverted to one or other of the original parents.\r\n\r\n2. The African forms. Naudin had no specimens in sufficiently good\r\ncondition, or of which the wild state was sufficiently certain to assert\r\npositively the habitation of the species in Africa. He admits it with\r\nhesitation. He includes in the species cultivated forms, or other wild\r\nones, of which he had not seen the fruit. Sir Joseph Hooker[1276]\r\nsubsequently obtained specimens which prove more. I am not speaking of\r\nthose from the Nile Valley,[1277] which are probably cultivated, but of\r\nplants gathered by Barter in Guinea in the sands on the banks of the\r\nNiger. Thonning[1278] had previously found, in sandy soil in Guinea, a\r\n_Cucumis_ to which he had given the name _arenarius_; and\r\nCogniaux,[1279] after having seen a specimen brought home by this\r\ntraveller, had classed it with _C. Melo_, as Sir J. Hooker thought. The\r\nnegroes eat the fruit of the plant found by Barter. The smell is that of\r\na fresh green melon. In Thonning’s plant the fruit is ovoid, the size of\r\na plum. Thus in Africa as in India the species bears small fruit in a\r\nwild state, as we might expect. The _Dudaim_ among cultivated varieties\r\nis allied to it.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the species of the genus _Cucumis_ are found in Africa;\r\na small minority in Asia or in America. Other species of _Cucurbitaceæ_\r\nare divided between Asia and America, although as a rule, in this\r\nfamily, the areas of species are continuous and restricted. _Cucumis\r\nMelo_ was once perhaps, like _Citrullus Colocynthis_ of the same family,\r\nwild from the west coast of Africa as far as India without any break.\r\n\r\nI formerly hesitated to admit that the melon was indigenous in the north\r\nof the Caucasus, as it is asserted by ancient authors—an assertion which\r\nhas not been confirmed by subsequent botanists. Hohenacker, who was said\r\nto have found the species near Elisabethpolis, makes no mention of it in\r\nhis paper upon the province of Talysch. M. Boissier does not include\r\n_Cucumis Melo_ in his Oriental flora. He merely says that it is easily\r\nnaturalized on rubbish-heaps and waste ground. The same thing has been\r\nobserved elsewhere, for instance in the sands of Ussuri, in Eastern\r\nAsia. This would be a reason for mistrusting the locality of the sands\r\nof the Niger, if the small size of the fruit in this case did not recall\r\nthe wild forms of India.\r\n\r\nThe culture of the melon, or of different varieties of the melon, may\r\nhave begun separately in India and Africa.\r\n\r\nIts introduction into China appears to date only from the eighth century\r\nof our era, judging from the epoch of the first work which mentions\r\nit.[1280] As the relations of the Chinese with Bactriana, and the\r\nnorth-west of India by the embassy of Chang-kien, date from the second\r\ncentury, it is possible that the culture of the species was not then\r\nwidely diffused in Asia. The small size of the wild fruit offered little\r\ninducement. No Sanskrit name is known, but there is a Tamul name,\r\nprobably less ancient, _molam_,[1281] which is like the Latin _Melo_.\r\n\r\nIt is not proved that the ancient Egyptians cultivated the melon. The\r\nfruit figured by Lepsius[1282] is not recognizable. If the cultivation\r\nhad been customary and ancient in that country, the Greeks and Romans\r\nwould have early known it. Now, it is doubtful whether the _Sikua_ of\r\nHippocrates and Theophrastus, or the _Pepon_ of Dioscorides, or the\r\n_Melopepo_ of Pliny, was the melon. The passages referring to it are\r\nbrief and insignificant; Galen[1283] is less obscure, when he says that\r\nthe inside of the _Melopepones_ is eaten, but not of the _Pepones_.\r\nThere has been much discussion about those names,[1284] but we want\r\nfacts more than words. The best proof which I have been able to discover\r\nof the existence of the melon among the Romans is a very accurate\r\nrepresentation of a fruit in the beautiful mosaic of fruits in the\r\nVatican. Moreover, Dr. Comes certifies that the half of a melon is\r\nrepresented in a painting at Herculaneum.[1285] The species was probably\r\nintroduced into the Græco-Roman world at the time of the Empire, in the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era. It was probably of indifferent quality,\r\nto judge from the silence or the faint praise of writers in a country\r\nwhere _gourmets_ were not wanting. Since the Renaissance, an improved\r\ncultivation and relations with the East have introduced better\r\nvarieties into our gardens. We know, however, that they often degenerate\r\neither from cold or bad conditions of soil, or by crossing with inferior\r\nvarieties of the species.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Water-Melon+—_Citrullus vulgaris_, Schrader; _Cucurbita Citrullus_,\r\nLinnæus.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the water-melon was long mistaken or unknown. According to\r\nLinnæus, it was a native of Southern Italy.[1286] This assertion was\r\ntaken from Matthiole, without observing that this author says it was a\r\ncultivated species. Seringe,[1287] in 1828, supposed it came from India\r\nand Africa, but he gives no proof. I believed it came from Southern\r\nAsia, because of its very general cultivation in this region. It was not\r\nknown in a wild state. At length it was found indigenous in tropical\r\nAfrica, on both sides of the equator, which settles the question.[1288]\r\nLivingstone[1289] saw districts literally covered with it, and the\r\nsavages and several kinds of wild animals eagerly devoured the wild\r\nfruit. They are sometimes, but not always, bitter, and this cannot be\r\ndetected from the appearance of the fruit. The negroes strike it with an\r\naxe, and taste the juice to see whether it is good or bad. This\r\ndiversity in the wild plant, growing in the same climate and in the same\r\nsoil, is calculated to show the small value of such a character in\r\ncultivated _Cucurbitaceæ_. For the rest, the frequent bitterness of the\r\nwater-melon is not at all extraordinary, as the most nearly allied\r\nspecies is _Citrullus Colocynthis_. Naudin obtained fertile hybrids from\r\ncrossing the bitter water-melon, wild at the Cape, with a cultivated\r\nspecies which confirms the specific unity suggested by the outward\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe species has not been found wild in Asia.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians cultivated the water-melon, which is represented\r\nin their paintings.[1290] This is one reason for believing that the\r\nIsraelites knew the species, and called it _abbatitchim_, as is said;\r\nbut besides the Arabic name, _battich_, _batteca_, evidently derived\r\nfrom the Hebrew, is the modern name for the water-melon. The French\r\nname, _pastèque_, comes through the Arabic from the Hebrew. A proof of\r\nthe antiquity of the plant in the north of Africa is found in the Berber\r\nname, _tadelaât_,[1291] which differs too widely from the Arabic name\r\nnot to have existed before the Conquest. The Spanish names _zandria_,\r\n_cindria_, and the Sardinian _sindria_,[1292] which I cannot connect\r\nwith any others, show also an ancient culture in the eastern part of the\r\nMediterranean basin. Its cultivation early spread into Asia, for there\r\nis a Sanskrit name, _chayapula_,[1293] but the Chinese only received the\r\nplant in the tenth century of the Christian era. They call it _si-kua_,\r\nthat is melon of the West.[1294]\r\n\r\nAs the water-melon is an annual, it ripens out of the tropics wherever\r\nthe summer is sufficiently hot. The modern Greeks cultivate it largely,\r\nand call it _carpousia_ or _carpousea_,[1295] but this name does not\r\noccur in ancient authors, nor even in the Greek of the decadence and of\r\nthe Middle Ages.[1296] It is the same as the _karpus_ of the Turks of\r\nConstantinople,[1297] which we find again in the Russian _arbus_,[1298]\r\nand in Bengali and Hindustani as _tarbuj_, _turbouz_.[1299] Another\r\nConstantinople name, mentioned by Forskal, _chimonico_, recurs in\r\nAlbanian _chimico_.[1300] The absence of an ancient Greek name which can\r\nwith certainty be attributed to this species, seems to show that it was\r\nintroduced into the Græco-Roman world about the beginning of the\r\nChristian era. The poem _Copa_, attributed to Virgil and Pliny, perhaps\r\nmentions it (lib. 19, cap. 5), as Naudin thinks, but it is doubtful.\r\n\r\nEuropeans have introduced the water-melon into America, where it is now\r\ncultivated from Chili to the United States. The _jacé_ of the\r\nBrazilians, of which Piso and Marcgraf have a drawing, is evidently\r\nintroduced, for the first-named author says it is cultivated and partly\r\nnaturalized.[1301]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Cucumber+—_Cucumis sativus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the very evident difference between the melon and cucumber,\r\nwhich both belong to the genus _Cucumis_, cultivators suppose that the\r\nspecies may be crossed, and that the quality of the melon is thus\r\nsometimes spoilt. Naudin[1302] ascertained by experiments that this\r\nfertilization is not possible, and has also shown that the distinction\r\nof the two species is well founded.\r\n\r\nThe original country of _Cucumis sativus_ was unknown to Linnæus and\r\nLamarck. In 1805, Wildenow[1303] asserted it was indigenous in Tartary\r\nand India, but without furnishing any proof. Later botanists have not\r\nconfirmed the assertion. When I went into the question in 1855, the\r\nspecies had not been anywhere found wild. For various reasons deduced\r\nfrom its ancient culture in Asia and in Europe, and especially from the\r\nexistence of a Sanskrit name, _soukasa_,[1304] I said, “Its original\r\nhabitat is probably the north-west of India, for instance Cabul, or some\r\nadjacent country. Everything seems to show that it will one day be\r\ndiscovered in these regions which are as yet but little known.”\r\n\r\nThis conjecture has been realized if we admit, with the best-informed\r\nmodern authors, that _Cucumis Hardwickii_, Royle, possesses the\r\ncharacteristics of _Cucumis sativus_. A coloured illustration of this\r\ncucumber found at the foot of the Himalayas may be seen in Royle’s\r\n_Illustrations of Himalayan Plants_, p. 220, pl. 47. The stems, leaves,\r\nand flowers are exactly those of _C. sativus_. The fruit, smooth and\r\nelliptical, has a bitter taste; but there are similar forms of the\r\ncultivated cucumber, and we know that in other species of the same\r\nfamily, the water-melon, for instance, the pulp is sweet or bitter. Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker, after describing the remarkable variety which he calls\r\nthe _Sikkim_ cucumber,[1305] adds that the variety _Hardwickii_, wild\r\nfrom Kumaon to Sikkim, and of which he has gathered specimens, does not\r\ndiffer more from the cultivated plant than certain varieties of the\r\nlatter differ from others; and Cogniaux, after seeing the plants in the\r\nherbarium at Kew, adopts this opinion.[1306]\r\n\r\nThe cucumber, cultivated in India for at least three thousand years, was\r\nonly introduced into China in the second century before Christ, when the\r\nambassador Chang-kien returned from Bactriana.[1307] The species spread\r\nmore rapidly towards the West. The ancient Greeks cultivated the\r\ncucumber under the name of _sikuos_,[1308] which remains as _si-kua_ in\r\nthe modern language. The modern Greeks have also the name _aggouria_,\r\nfrom an ancient Aryan root which is sometimes applied to the\r\nwater-melon, and which recurs for the cucumber in the Bohemian _agurka_,\r\nthe German _Gurke_, etc. The Albanians (Pelasgians?) have quite a\r\ndifferent name, _kratsavets_,[1309] which we recognize in the Slav\r\n_Krastavak_. The Latins called the cucumber _cucumis_. These different\r\nnames show the antiquity of the species in Europe. There is even an\r\nEsthonian name, _uggurits_, _ukkurits_, _urits_.[1310] It does not seem\r\nto be Finnish, but to belong to the same Aryan root as _aggouria_. If\r\nthe cucumber came into Europe before the Aryans, there would perhaps be\r\nsome name peculiar to the Basque language, or seeds would have been\r\nfound in the lake-dwellings of Switzerland and Savoy; but this is not\r\nthe case. The peoples in the neighbourhood of the Caucasus have names\r\nquite different to the Greek; in Tartar _kiar_, in Kalmuck _chaja_, in\r\nArmenian _karan_.[1311] The name _chiar_ exists also in Arabic for a\r\nvariety of the cucumber.[1312] This is, therefore, a Turanian name\r\nanterior to the Sanskrit, whereby its culture in Western Asia would be\r\nmore than three thousand years old.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that the cucumber is the _kischschuim_, one of the\r\nfruits of Egypt regretted by the Israelites in the desert.[1313]\r\nHowever, I do not find any Arabic name among the three given by Forskal\r\nwhich can be connected with this, and hitherto no trace has been found\r\nof the presence of the cucumber in ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n+West Indian Gherkin+—_Cucumis Anguria_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis small species of cucumber is designated in the _Bon Jardinier_\r\nunder the name of the cucumber _Arada_. The fruit, of the size of an\r\negg, is very prickly. It is eaten cooked or pickled. As the plant is\r\nvery productive, it is largely cultivated in the American colonies.\r\nDescourtilz and Sir Joseph Hooker have published good coloured\r\nillustrations of it, and M. Cogniaux a plate with a detailed analysis of\r\nthe flower.[1314]\r\n\r\nSeveral botanists affirm that it is wild in the West Indies. P.\r\nBrowne,[1315] in the last century, spoke of the plant as the “little\r\nwild cucumber” (in Jamaica). Descourtilz said, “The cucumber grows wild\r\neverywhere, and principally in the dry savannahs and near rivers, whose\r\nbanks afford a rich vegetation.” The inhabitants call it the “maroon\r\ncucumber.” Grisebach[1316] saw specimens in several other West India\r\nIsles, and appears to admit their wild character. M. E. André found the\r\nspecies growing in the sand of the sea-shore at Porto-Cabello, and\r\nBurchell in a similar locality in Brazil, and Riedel near Rio di\r\nJaneiro.[1317] In the case of a number of other specimens gathered in\r\nthe east of America from Brazil to Florida, it is unknown whether they\r\nwere wild or cultivated. A wild Brazilian plant, badly drawn by\r\nPiso,[1318] is mentioned as belonging to the species, but I am very\r\ndoubtful of this.\r\n\r\nBotanists from Tournefort down to our own day have considered the\r\nAnguria to be of American origin, a native of Jamaica in particular. M.\r\nNaudin[1319] was the first to point out that all the other species of\r\n_Cucumis_ are of the old world, and principally African. He wondered\r\nwhether this one had not been introduced into America by the negroes,\r\nlike many other plants which have become naturalized. However, unable to\r\nfind any similar African plant, he adopted the general opinion. Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker, on the contrary, is inclined to believe that _C. Anguria_\r\nis a cultivated and modified form of some African species nearly allied\r\nto _C. prophetarum_ and _C. Figarei_, although these are perennial. In\r\nfavour of this hypothesis, I may add: (1) The name _maroon_ cucumber,\r\ngiven in the French West India Islands, indicates a plant which has\r\nbecome wild, for this is the meaning of the word _maroon_ as applied to\r\nthe negroes; (2) its extended area in America from Brazil to the West\r\nIndies, always along the coast where the slave trade was most brisk,\r\nseems to be a proof of foreign origin. If the species grew in America\r\nprevious to its discovery, it would, with such an extensive habitat,\r\nhave been also found upon the west coast of America, and inland, which\r\nis not the case.\r\n\r\nThe question can only be solved by a more complete knowledge of the\r\nAfrican species of _Cucumis_, and by experiments upon fertilization, if\r\nany have the patience and ability necessary to do for the genus\r\n_Cucumis_ what Naudin has done for the genus _Cucurbita_.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would point out the absurdity of a common name for the Anguria\r\nin the United States—_Jerusalem Cucumber_.[1320] After this, is it\r\npossible to take popular names as a guide in our search for origins?\r\n\r\n\r\n+White Gourd-melon+, or +Benincasa+—_Benincasa hispida_, Thunberg;\r\n_Benincasa cerifera_, Savi.\r\n\r\nThis species, which is the only one of the genus Benincasa, is so like\r\nthe pumpkins that early botanists took it for one,[1321] in spite of the\r\nwaxy efflorescence on the surface of the fruit. It is very generally\r\ncultivated in tropical countries. It was, perhaps, a mistake to abandon\r\nits cultivation in Europe after having tried it, for Naudin and the _Bon\r\nJardinier_ both recommend it.\r\n\r\nIt is the _cumbalam_ of Rheede, the _camolenga_ of Rumphius, who had\r\nseen it cultivated in Malabar and the Sunda Islands, and give\r\nillustrations of it.\r\n\r\nFrom several works, even recent ones,[1322] it might be supposed that it\r\nhad never been found in a wild state, but if we notice the different\r\nnames under which it has been described we shall find that this is not\r\nthe case. Thus _Cucurbita hispida_, Thunberg, and _Lagenaria\r\ndasystemon_, Miquel, from authentic specimens seen by Cogniaux,[1323]\r\nare synonyms of the species, and these plants are wild in Japan.[1324]\r\n_Cucurbita littoralis_, Hasskarl,[1325] found among shrubs on the\r\nsea-shore in Java, and _Gymnopetalum septemlobum_, Miquel, also in Java,\r\nare the _Benincasa_ according to Cogniaux. As are also _Cucurbita\r\nvacua_, Mueller,[1326] and _Cucurbita pruriens_, Forster, of which he\r\nhas seen authentic specimens found at Rockingham, in Australia, and in\r\nthe Society Islands. Nadeaud[1327] does not mention the latter.\r\nTemporary naturalization may be suspected in the Pacific Isles and in\r\nQueensland, but the localities of Java and Japan seem quite certain. I\r\nam the more inclined to believe in the latter, that the cultivation of\r\nthe Benincasa in China dates from the remotest antiquity.[1328]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Towel Gourd+—_Momordica cylindrica_, Linnæus; _Luffa cylindrica_,\r\nRœmer.\r\n\r\nNaudin[1329] says, “_Luffa cylindrica_, which in some of our colonies\r\nhas retained the Indian name _pétole_, is probably a native of Southern\r\nAsia, and perhaps also of Africa, Australia, and Polynesia. It is\r\ncultivated by the peoples of most hot countries, and it appears to be\r\nnaturalized in many places where it doubtless did not exist originally.”\r\nCogniaux[1330] is more positive. “An indigenous species,” he says, “in\r\nall the tropical regions of the old world; often cultivated and half\r\nwild in America between the tropics.” In consulting the works quoted in\r\nthese two monographs, and herbaria, its character as a wild plant will\r\nbe found sometimes conclusively certified.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Asia,[1331] Rheede saw it in sandy places, in woods and\r\nother localities in Malabar; Roxburgh says it is wild in Hindustan;\r\nKurz, in the forests of Burmah; Thwaites, in Ceylon. I have specimens\r\nfrom Ceylon and Khasia. There is no Sanskrit name known, and Dr.\r\nBretschneider, in his work _On the Study and Value of Chinese Botanical\r\nWorks_, and in his letters mentions no luffa either wild or cultivated\r\nin China. I suppose, therefore, that its cultivation is not ancient even\r\nin India.\r\n\r\nThe species is wild in Australia, on the banks of rivers in\r\nQueensland,[1332] and hence it is probable it will be found wild in the\r\nAsiatic Archipelago, where Rumphius, Miquel, etc., only mention it as a\r\ncultivated plant.\r\n\r\nHerbaria contain a great number of specimens from tropical Africa, from\r\nMozambique to the coast of Guinea, and even as far as Angola, but\r\ncollectors do not appear to have indicated whether they were cultivated\r\nor wild plants. In the Delessert herbarium, Heudelot indicates it as\r\ngrowing in fertile ground in the environs of Galam. Sir Joseph\r\nHooker[1333] quotes this without affirming anything. Schweinfurth and\r\nAscheron,[1334] who are always careful in this matter, say the species\r\nis only a cultivated one in the Nile Valley. This is curious, because\r\nthe plant was seen in the seventeenth century in Egyptian gardens under\r\nthe Arabian name of _luff_,[1335] whence the genus was called _Luffa_,\r\nand the species _Luffa ægyptica_. The ancient Egyptian monuments show no\r\ntrace of it. The absence of a Hebrew name is another reason for\r\nbelieving that its cultivation was introduced into Egypt in the Middle\r\nAges. It is now grown in the Delta, not only for the fruit but also for\r\nthe export of the seed, from which a preparation is made for softening\r\nthe skin.\r\n\r\nThe species is cultivated in Brazil, Guiana, Mexico, etc., but I find no\r\nindication that it is indigenous in America. It appears to have been\r\nhere and there naturalized, in Nicaragua for instance, from a specimen\r\nof Levy’s.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the Asiatic origin is certain, the African very doubtful, that\r\nof America imaginary, or rather the effect of naturalization.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Angular Luffa+—_Luffa acutangula_, Roxburgh.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this species, cultivated like the preceding one in all\r\ntropical countries, is not very clear, according to Naudin and\r\nCogniaux.[1336] The first gives Senegal, the second Asia, and,\r\ndoubtfully, Africa. It is hardly necessary to say that Linnæus[1337] was\r\nmistaken in indicating Tartary and China. Clarke, in Sir Joseph Hooker’s\r\nflora, says without hesitation that it is indigenous in British India.\r\nRheede[1338] formerly saw the plant in sandy soil in Malabar. Its\r\nnatural area seems to be limited, for Thwaites in Ceylon, Kurz in\r\nBritish Burmah, and Loureiro in China and Cochin-China,[1339] only give\r\nthe species as cultivated, or growing on rubbish-heaps near gardens.\r\nRumphius[1340] calls it a Bengal plant. No luffa has been long\r\ncultivated in China, according to a letter of Dr. Bretschneider. No\r\nSanskrit name is known. All these are indications of a comparatively\r\nrecent culture in Asia.\r\n\r\nA variety with bitter fruit is common in British India[1341] in a wild\r\nstate, since there is no inducement to cultivate it. It exists also in\r\nthe Sunda Islands. It is _Luffa amara_, Roxburgh, and _L. sylvestris_,\r\nMiquel. _L. subangulata_, Miquel, is another variety which grows in\r\nJava, which M. Cogniaux also unites with the others from authentic\r\nspecimens which he saw.\r\n\r\nM. Naudin does not say what traveller gives the plant as wild in\r\nSenegambia; but he says the negroes call it _papengaye_, and as this is\r\nthe name of the Mauritius planters,[1342] it is probable that the plant\r\nis cultivated in Senegal, and perhaps naturalized near dwellings. Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker, in the _Flora of Tropical Africa_, gives the species, but\r\nwithout proof that it is wild in Africa, and Cogniaux is still more\r\nbrief. Schweinfurth and Ascheron[1343] do not mention it either as wild\r\nor cultivated in Egypt, Nubia, and Abyssinia. There is no trace of its\r\nancient cultivation in Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe species has often been sent from the West Indies, New Granada,\r\nBrazil, and other parts of America, but there is no indication that it\r\nhas been long in these places, nor even that it occurs at a distance\r\nfrom gardens in a really wild state.\r\n\r\nThe conditions or probabilities of origin, and of date of culture, are,\r\nit will be seen, identical for the two cultivated species of luffa. In\r\nsupport of the hypothesis that the latter is not of African origin, I\r\nmay say that the four other species of the genus are Asiatic or\r\nAmerican; and as a sign that the cultivation of the luffa is not very\r\nancient, I will add that the form of the fruit varies much less than in\r\nthe other cultivated cucurbitacea.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Snake Gourd+—_Trichosanthes anguina_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nAn annual creeping _Cucurbitacea_, remarkable for its fringed corolla.\r\nIt is called _petole_ in Mauritius, from a Java name. The fruit, which\r\nis something like a long fleshy pod of some leguminous plants, is eaten\r\ncooked like a cucumber in tropical Asia.\r\n\r\nAs the botanists of the seventeenth century received the plant from\r\nChina, they imagined that the plant was indigenous there, but it was\r\nprobably cultivated. Dr. Bretschneider[1344] tells us that the Chinese\r\nname, _mankua_, means “cucumber of the southern barbarians.” Its home\r\nmust be India, or the Indian Archipelago. No author, however, asserts\r\nthat it has been found in a distinctly wild state. Thus Clarke, in\r\nHooker’s _Flora of British India_, ii. p. 610, says only, “India,\r\ncultivated.” Naudin,[1345] before him, said, “Inhabits the East Indies,\r\nwhere it is much cultivated for its fruits. It is rarely found wild.”\r\nRumphius[1346] is not more positive for Amboyna. Loureiro and Kurz in\r\nCochin-China and Burmah, Blume and Miquel in the islands to the south of\r\nAsia, have only seen the plant cultivated. The thirty-nine other species\r\nof the genus are all of the old world, found between China or Japan, the\r\nwest of India and Australia. They belong especially to India and the\r\nMalay Archipelago. I consider the Indian origin as the most probable\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe species has been introduced into Mauritius, where it sows itself\r\nround cultivated places. Elsewhere it is little diffused. No Sanskrit\r\nname is known.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Chayote+, or +Choco+—_Sechium edule_ Swartz.\r\n\r\nThis plant, of the order _Cucurbitaceæ_, is cultivated in tropical\r\nAmerica for its fruits, shaped like a pear, and tasting like a cucumber.\r\nThey contain only one seed, so that the flesh is abundant.\r\n\r\nThe species alone constitutes the genus Sechium. There are specimens in\r\nevery herbarium, but generally collectors do not indicate whether they\r\nare naturalized, or really wild, and apparently indigenous in the\r\ncountry. Without speaking of works in which this plant is said to come\r\nfrom the East Indies, which is entirely a mistake, several of the best\r\ngive Jamaica[1347] as the original home. However, P. Browne,[1348] in\r\nthe middle of the last century, said positively that it was cultivated\r\nthere, and Sloane does not mention it. Jacquin[1349] says that it\r\n“inhabits Cuba, and is cultivated there,” and Richard copies this phrase\r\nin the flora of R. de La Sagra without adding any proof. Naudin\r\nsays,[1350] “a Mexican plant,” but he does not give his reasons for\r\nasserting this. Cogniaux,[1351] in his recent monograph, mentions a\r\ngreat number of specimens gathered from Brazil to the West Indies\r\nwithout saying if he had seen any one of these given as wild.\r\nSeemann[1352] saw the plant cultivated at Panama, and he adds a remark,\r\nimportant if correct, namely, that the name _chayote_, common in the\r\nisthmus, is the corruption of an Aztec word, _chayotl_. This is an\r\nindication of an ancient existence in Mexico, but I do not find the word\r\nin Hernandez, the classic author on the Mexican plants anterior to the\r\nSpanish conquest. The _chayote_ was not cultivated in Cayenne ten years\r\nago.[1353] Nothing indicates an ancient cultivation in Brazil. The\r\nspecies is not mentioned by early writers, such as Piso and Marcgraf,\r\nand the name _chuchu_, given as Brazilian,[1354] seems to me to come\r\nfrom _chocho_, the Jamaica name, which is perhaps a corruption of the\r\nMexican word.\r\n\r\nThe plant is probably a native of the south of Mexico and of Central\r\nAmerica, and was transported into the West India Islands and to Brazil\r\nin the eighteenth century. The species was afterwards introduced into\r\nMauritius and Algeria, where it is very successful.[1355]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Indian Fig+, or +Prickly Pear+—_Opuntia ficus indica_, Miller.\r\n\r\nThis fleshy plant of the _Cactus_ family, which produces the fruit known\r\nin the south of Europe as the Indian fig, has no connection with the fig\r\ntree, nor has the fruit with the fig. Its origin is not Indian but\r\nAmerican. Everything is erroneous and absurd in this common name.\r\nHowever, since Linnæus took his botanical name from it, _Cactus ficus\r\nindica_, afterwards connected with the genus _Opuntia_, it was necessary\r\nto retain the specific name to avoid changes which are a source of\r\nconfusion, and to recall the popular denomination. The prickly forms,\r\nand those more or less free from spines, have been considered by some\r\nauthors as distinct species, but an attentive examination leads us to\r\nregard them as one.[1356]\r\n\r\nThe species existed both wild and cultivated in Mexico before the\r\narrival of the Spaniards. Hernandez[1357] describes nine varieties of\r\nit, which shows the antiquity of its cultivation. The cochineal insect\r\nappears to feed on one of these, almost without thorns, more than on the\r\nothers, and it has been transported with the plant to the Canary Isles\r\nand elsewhere. It is not known how far its habitat extended in America\r\nbefore man transported pieces of the plant, shaped like a racket, and\r\nthe fruits, which are two easy ways of propagating it. Perhaps the wild\r\nplants in Jamaica, and the other West India Islands mentioned by\r\nSloane,[1358] in 1725, were the result of its introduction by the\r\nSpaniards. Certainly the species has become naturalized in this\r\ndirection as far as the climate permits; for instance, as far as\r\nSouthern Florida.[1359]\r\n\r\nIt was one of the first plants which the Spaniards introduced to the old\r\nworld, both in Europe and Asia. Its singular appearance was the more\r\nstriking that no other species belonging to the family had before been\r\nseen.[1360] All sixteenth-century botanists mention it, and the plant\r\nbecame naturalized in the south of Europe and in Africa as its\r\ncultivation was introduced. It was in Spain that the prickly pear was\r\nfirst known under the American name _tuna_, and it was probably the\r\nMoors who took it into Barbary when they were expelled from the\r\npeninsula. They called it fig of the Christians.[1361] The custom of\r\nusing the plant for fences, and the nourishing property of the fruits,\r\nwhich contain a large proportion of sugar, have determined its extension\r\nround the Mediterranean, and in general in all countries near the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the cochineal, which was unfavourable to the\r\nproduction of the fruit,[1362] is dying out since the manufacture of\r\ncolouring matters by chemical processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Gooseberry+—_Ribes grossularia_ and _R. Vacrispa_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the cultivated varieties is generally smooth, or provided\r\nwith a few stiff hairs, while that of the wild varieties has soft and\r\nshorter hairs; but intermediate forms exist, and it has been shown by\r\nexperiment that by sowing the seeds of the cultivated fruit, plants with\r\neither smooth or hairy fruit are obtained.[1363] There is, therefore,\r\nbut one species, which has produced under cultivation one principal\r\nvariety and several sub-varieties as to the size, colour, or taste of\r\nthe fruit.\r\n\r\nThe gooseberry grows wild throughout temperate Europe, from Southern\r\nSweden to the mountainous regions of Central Spain, of Italy, and of\r\nGreece.[1364] It is also mentioned in Northern Africa, but the last\r\npublished catalogue of Algerian plants[1365] indicates it only in the\r\nmountains of Aures, and Ball has found a variety in the Atlas of\r\nMarocco.[1366] It grows in the Caucasus,[1367] and under more or less\r\ndifferent forms in the western Himalayas.[1368]\r\n\r\nThe Greeks and Romans do not mention the species, which is rare in the\r\nSouth, and which is hardly worth planting where grapes will ripen. It is\r\nespecially in Germany, Holland, and England that it has been cultivated\r\nfrom the sixteenth century,[1369] principally as a seasoning, whence the\r\nEnglish name, and the French _groseille à maquereaux_ (mackerel\r\ncurrant). A wine is also made from it.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of its cultivation in the British Isles and in other\r\nplaces where it is found wild, which are often near gardens, has\r\nsuggested to some English botanists the idea of an accidental\r\nnaturalization. This is likely enough in Ireland;[1370] but as it is an\r\nessentially European species, I do not see why it should not have\r\nexisted in England, where the wild plant is more common, since the\r\nestablishment of most of the species of the British flora; that is to\r\nsay, since the end of the glacial period, before the separation of the\r\nisland from the continent. Phillips quotes an old English name,\r\n_feaberry_ or _feabes_, which supports the theory of an ancient\r\nexistence, and two Welsh names,[1371] of which I cannot, however,\r\ncertify the originality.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Red Currant+—_Ribes rubrum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe common red currant is wild throughout Northern and Temperate Europe,\r\nand in Siberia[1372] as far as Kamtschatka, and in America, from Canada\r\nand Vermont to the mouth of the river Mackenzie.[1373]\r\n\r\nLike the preceding species, it was unknown to the Greeks and Romans, and\r\nits cultivation was only introduced in the Middle Ages. The cultivated\r\nplant hardly differs from the wild one. That the plant was foreign to\r\nthe south of Europe is shown by the name of _groseillier d’outremer_\r\n(currant from beyond the sea), given in France[1374] in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. In Geneva the currant is still commonly called _raisin de\r\nmare_, and in the canton of Soleure _meertrübli_. I do not know why the\r\nspecies was supposed, three centuries ago, to have come from beyond\r\nseas. Perhaps this should be understood to mean that it was brought by\r\nthe Danes and the Northmen, and that these peoples from beyond the\r\nnorthern seas introduced its cultivation. I doubt it, however, for the\r\n_Ribes rubrum_ is wild in almost the whole of Great Britain[1375] and in\r\nNormandy;[1376] the English, who were in constant communication with the\r\nDanes, did not cultivate it as late as 1557, from a list of the fruits\r\nof that epoch drawn up by Th. Tusser, and published by Phillips;[1377]\r\nand even in the time of Gerard, in 1597,[1378] its cultivation was rare,\r\nand the plant had no particular name.[1379] Lastly, there are French and\r\nBreton names which indicate a cultivation anterior to the Normans in the\r\nwest of France.\r\n\r\nThe old names in France are given in the dictionary by Ménage. According\r\nto him, red currants are called at Rouen _gardes_, at Caen _grades_, in\r\nLower Normandy _gradilles_, and in Anjou _castilles_. Ménage derives all\r\nthese names from _rubius_, _rubicus_, etc., by a series of imaginary\r\ntransformations, from the word _ruber_, red. Legonidec[1380] tells us\r\nthat red currants are also called _Kastilez_ (l. liquid) in Brittany,\r\nand he derives this name from Castille, as if a fruit scarcely known in\r\nSpain and abundant in the north could come from Spain. These words,\r\nfound both in Brittany and beyond its limits, appear to me to be of\r\nCeltic origin; and I may mention, in support of this theory, that in\r\nLegonidec’s dictionary _gardis_ means _rough_, _harsh_, _pungent_,\r\n_sour_, etc., which gives a hint as to the etymology. The generic name\r\n_Ribes_ has caused other errors. It was thought the plant might be one\r\nwhich was so called by the Arabs; but the word comes rather from a name\r\nfor the currant very common in the north, _ribs_ in Danish,[1381] _risp_\r\nand _resp_ in Swedish.[1382] The Slav names are quite different and in\r\nconsiderable number.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Black Currant+—_Cassis_; _Ribes nigrum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe black currant grows wild in the north of Europe, from Scotland and\r\nLapland as far as the north of France and Italy; in Bosnia,[1383]\r\nArmenia,[1384] throughout Siberia, in the basin of the river Amur, and\r\nin the western Himalayas;[1385] it often becomes naturalized, as for\r\ninstance, in the centre of France.[1386]\r\n\r\nThis shrub was unknown in Greece and Italy, for it is proper to colder\r\ncountries. From the variety of the names in all the languages, even in\r\nthose anterior to the Aryans, of the north of Europe, it is clear that\r\nthis fruit was very early sought after, and its cultivation was probably\r\nbegun before the Middle Ages. J. Bauhin[1387] says it was planted in\r\ngardens in France and Italy, but most sixteenth-century authors do not\r\nmention it. In the _Histoire de la Vie Privée des Français_, by Le Grand\r\nd’Aussy, published in 1872, vol. i. p. 232, the following curious\r\npassage occurs: “The black currant has been cultivated hardly forty\r\nyears, and it owes its reputation to a pamphlet entitled _Culture du\r\nCassis_, in which the author attributed to this shrub all the virtues it\r\nis possible to imagine.” Further on (vol. iii. p. 80), the author\r\nmentions the frequent use, since the publication of the pamphlet in\r\nquestion, of a liqueur made from the black currant. Bosc, who is always\r\naccurate in his articles in the _Dictionnaire d’Agriculture_, mentions\r\nthis fashion under the head _Currant_, but he is careful to add, “It has\r\nbeen very long in cultivation for its fruit, which has a peculiar odour\r\nagreeable to some, disagreeable to others, and which is held to be\r\nstomachic and diuretic.” It is also used in the manufacture of the\r\nliqueurs known as ratafia de Cassis.[1388]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Olive+—_Olea Europea_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe wild olive, called in botanical books the variety _sylvestris_ or\r\n_oleaster_, is distinguished from the cultivated olive tree by a smaller\r\nfruit, of which the flesh is not so abundant. The best fruits are\r\nobtained by selecting the seeds, buds, or grafts from good varieties.\r\n\r\nThe oleaster now exists over a wide area east and west of Syria, from\r\nthe Punjab and Beluchistan[1389] as far as Portugal and even Madeira,\r\nthe Canaries and even Marocco,[1390] and from the Atlas northwards as\r\nfar as the south of France, the ancient Macedonia, the Crimea, and the\r\nCaucasus.[1391] If we compare the accounts of travellers and of the\r\nauthors of floras, it will be seen that towards the limits of this area\r\nthere is often a doubt as to the wild and indigenous (that is to say\r\nancient in the country) nature of the species. Sometimes it offers\r\nitself as a shrub which fruits little or not at all; and sometimes, as\r\nin the Crimea, the plants are rare as though they had escaped, as an\r\nexception, the destructive effects of winters too severe to allow of a\r\ndefinite establishment. As regards Algeria and the south of France,\r\nthese doubts have been the subject of a discussion among competent men\r\nin the Botanical Society.[1392] They repose upon the uncontestable fact\r\nthat birds often transport the seed of the olive into uncultivated and\r\nsterile places, where the wild form, the oleaster, is produced and\r\nnaturalized.\r\n\r\nThe question is not clearly stated when we ask if such and such olive\r\ntrees of a given locality are really wild. In a woody species which\r\nlives so long and shoots again from the same stock when cut off by\r\naccident, it is impossible to know the origin of the individuals\r\nobserved. They may have been sown by man or birds at a very early epoch,\r\nfor olive trees of more than a thousand years old are known. The effect\r\nof such sowing is a naturalization, which is equivalent to an extension\r\nof area. The point in question is, therefore, to discover what was the\r\nhome of the species in very early prehistoric times, and how this area\r\nhas grown larger by different modes of transport.\r\n\r\nIt is not by the study of living olive trees that this question can be\r\nanswered. We must seek in what countries the cultivation began, and how\r\nit was propagated. The more ancient it is in any region, the more\r\nprobable it is that the species has existed wild there from the time of\r\nthose geological events which took place before the coming of\r\nprehistoric man.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Hebrew books mention the olive _sait_, or _zeit_,[1393]\r\nboth wild and cultivated. It was one of the trees promised in the land\r\nof Canaan. It is first mentioned in Genesis, where it is said that the\r\ndove sent out by Noah should bring back a branch of olive. If we take\r\ninto account this tradition, which is accompanied by miraculous details,\r\nit may be added that the discoveries of modern erudition show that the\r\nMount Ararat of the Bible must be to the east of the mountain in Armenia\r\nwhich now bears that name, and which was anciently called Masis. From a\r\nstudy of the text of the Book of Genesis, François Lenormand[1394]\r\nplaces the mountain in question in the Hindu Kush, and even near the\r\nsources of the Indus. This theory supposes it near to the land of the\r\nAryans, yet the olive has no Sanskrit name, not even in that Sanskrit\r\nfrom which the Indian languages[1395] are derived. If the olive had\r\nthen, as now, existed in the Punjab, the eastern Aryans in their\r\nmigrations towards the south would probably have given it a name, and if\r\nit had existed in the Mazanderan, to the south of the Caspian Sea, as\r\nat the present day, the western Aryans would perhaps have known it. To\r\nthese negative indications, it can only be objected that the wild olive\r\nattracts no considerable attention, and that the idea of extracting oil\r\nfrom it perhaps arose late in this part of Asia.\r\n\r\nHerodotus[1396] tells us that Babylonia grew no olive trees, and that\r\nits inhabitants made use of oil of sesame. It is certain that a country\r\nso subject to inundation was not at all favourable to the olive. The\r\ncold excludes the higher plateaux and the mountains of the north of\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\nI do not know if there is a name in Zend, but the Semitic word _sait_\r\nmust date from a remote antiquity, for it is found in modern Persian,\r\n_seitun_,[1397] and in Arabic, _zeitun_, _sjetun_.[1398] It even exists\r\nin Turkish and among the Tartars of the Crimea, _seitun_,[1399] which\r\nmay signify that it is of Turanian origin, or from the remote epoch when\r\nthe Turanian and Semitic peoples intermixed.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians cultivated the olive tree, which they called\r\n_tat_.[1400] Several botanists have ascertained the presence of branches\r\nor leaves of the olive in the sarcophagi.[1401] Nothing is more certain,\r\nthough Hehn[1402] has recently asserted the contrary, without giving any\r\nproof in support of his opinion. It would be interesting to know to what\r\ndynasty belong the most ancient mummy-cases in which olive branches have\r\nbeen found. The Egyptian name, quite different to the Semitic, shows an\r\nexistence more ancient than the earliest dynasties. I shall mention\r\npresently another fact in support of this great antiquity.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus says[1403] that the olive was much grown, and the harvest\r\nof oil considerable in Cyrenaica, but he does not say that the species\r\nwas wild there, and the quantity of oil mentioned seems to point to a\r\ncultivated variety. The low-lying, very hot country between Egypt and\r\nthe Atlas is little favourable to a naturalization of the olive outside\r\nthe plantations. Kralik, a very accurate botanist, did not anywhere see\r\non his journey to Tunis and into Egypt the olive growing wild,[1404]\r\nalthough it is cultivated in the oases. In Egypt it is only cultivated,\r\naccording to Schweinfurth and Ascherson,[1405] in their _resumé_ of the\r\nFlora of the Nile Valley.\r\n\r\nIts prehistoric area probably extended from Syria towards Greece, for\r\nthe wild olive is very common along the southern coast of Asia Minor,\r\nwhere it forms regular woods.[1406] It is doubtless here and in the\r\narchipelago that the Greeks early knew the tree. If they had not known\r\nit on their own territory, had received it from the Semites, they would\r\nnot have given it a special name, _elaia_, whence the Latin _olea_. The\r\n_Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ mention the hardness of the olive wood and the\r\npractice of anointing the body with olive oil. The latter was in\r\nconstant use for food and lighting. Mythology attributed to Minerva the\r\nplanting of the olive in Attica, which probably signifies the\r\nintroduction of cultivated varieties and suitable processes for\r\nextracting the oil. Aristæus introduced or perfected the manner of\r\npressing the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe same mythical personage carried, it was said, the olive tree from\r\nthe north of Greece into Sicily and Sardinia. It seems that this may\r\nhave been early done by the Phœnicians, but in support of the idea that\r\nthe species, or a perfected variety of it, was introduced by the Greeks,\r\nI may mention that the Semitic name _seit_ has left no trace in the\r\nislands of the Mediterranean. We find the Græco-Latin name here as in\r\nItaly,[1407] while upon the neighbouring coast of Africa, and in Spain,\r\nthe names are Egyptian or Arabic, as I shall explain directly.\r\n\r\nThe Romans knew the olive later than the Greeks. According to\r\nPliny,[1408] it was only at the time of Tarquin the Ancient, 627 B.C.,\r\nbut the species probably existed already in Great Greece, as in Greece\r\nand Sicily. Besides, Pliny was speaking of the cultivated olive.\r\n\r\nA remarkable fact, and one which has not been noted or discussed by\r\nphilologists, is that the Berber name for the olive, both tree and\r\nfruit, has the root _taz_ or _tas_, similar to the _tat_ of the ancient\r\nEgyptians. The Kabyles of the district of Algiers, according to the\r\nFrench-Berber dictionary, published by the French Government, calls the\r\nwild olive _tazebboujt_, _tesettha_, _ou’ zebbouj_, and the grafted\r\nolive _tazemmourt_, _tasettha_, _ou’ zemmour_. The Touaregs, another\r\nBerber nation, call it _tamahinet_.[1409] These are strong indications\r\nof the antiquity of the olive in Africa. The Arabs having conquered this\r\ncountry and driven back the Berbers into the mountains and the desert,\r\nhaving likewise subjected Spain excepting the Basque country, the names\r\nderived from the Semitic _zeit_ have prevailed even in Spanish. The\r\nArabs of Algiers say _zenboudje_ for the wild, _zitoun_ for the\r\ncultivated olive,[1410] _zit_ for olive oil. The Andalusians call the\r\nwild olive _azebuche_, and the cultivated _aceytuno_.[1411] In other\r\nprovinces we find the name of Latin origin, _olivio_, side by side with\r\nthe Arabic words.[1412] The oil is in Spanish _aceyte_, which is almost\r\nthe Hebrew name; but the holy oils are called _oleos santos_, because\r\nthey belong to Rome. The Basques use the Latin name for the olive tree.\r\n\r\nEarly voyagers to the Canaries, Bontier for instance, in 1403, mention\r\nthe olive tree in these islands, where modern botanists regard it as\r\nindigenous.[1413] It may have been introduced by the Phœnicians, if it\r\ndid not previously exist there. We do not know if the Guanchos had names\r\nfor the olive and its oil. Webb and Berthelot do not give any in their\r\nlearned chapter on the language of the aborigines,[1414] so the question\r\nis open to conjecture. It seems to me that the oil would have played an\r\nimportant part among the Guanchos if they had possessed the olive, and\r\nthat some traces of it would have remained in the actual speech of the\r\npeople. From this point of view the naturalization in the Canaries is\r\nperhaps not more ancient than the Phœnician voyages.\r\n\r\nNo leaf of the olive has hitherto been found in the tufa of the south of\r\nFrance, of Tuscany, and Sicily, where the laurel, the myrtle, and other\r\nshrubs now existing have been discovered. This is an indication, until\r\nthe contrary is proved, of a subsequent naturalization.\r\n\r\nThe olive thrives in dry climates like that of Syria and Assyria. It\r\nsucceeds at the Cape, in parts of America, in Australia, and doubtless\r\nit will become wild in these places when it has been more generally\r\nplanted. Its slow growth, the necessity of grafting or of choosing the\r\nshoots of good varieties, and especially the concurrence of other\r\noil-producing species, have hitherto impeded its extension; but a tree\r\nwhich produces in an ungrateful soil should not be indefinitely\r\nneglected. Even in the old world, where it has existed for so many\r\nthousands of years, its productiveness might be doubled by taking the\r\ntrouble to graft on wild trees, as the French have done in Algeria.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Star Apple+—_Chrysophyllum Caïnito_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe star apple belongs to the family of the Sapotaceæ. It yields a fruit\r\nvalued in tropical America, though Europeans do not care much for it. I\r\ndo not find that any pains have been taken to introduce it into the\r\ncolonies of Asia or Africa. Tussac gives a good illustration of it in\r\nhis _Flore des Antilles_, vol. ii. pl. 9.\r\n\r\nSeemann[1415] saw the star apple wild in several places in the Isthmus\r\nof Panama. De Tussac, a San Domingo colonist, considered it wild in the\r\nforests of the West India Islands, and Grisebach[1416] says it is both\r\nwild and cultivated in Jamaica, San Domingo, Antigua, and Trinidad.\r\nSloane considered it had escaped from cultivation in Jamaica, and\r\nJacquin says vaguely, “Inhabits Martinique and San Domingo.”[1417]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Caïmito+, or +Abi+—_Lucuma Caïnito_, Alph. de Candolle.\r\n\r\nThis Peruvian Caïmito must not be confounded with the _Chrysophyllum\r\nCaïnito_ of the West Indies. Both belong to the family Sapotaceæ, but\r\nthe flowers and seeds are different. There is a figure of this one in\r\nRuiz and Pavon, _Flora Peruviana_, vol. iii. pl. 240. It has been\r\ntransported from Peru, where it is cultivated, to Ega on the Amazon\r\nRiver, and to Para, where it is commonly called _abi_ or _abiu_.[1418]\r\nRuiz and Pavon say it is wild in the warm regions of Peru, and at the\r\nfoot of the Andes.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Marmalade Plum+, or +Mammee Sapota+—_Lucuma mammosa_, Gærtner.\r\n\r\nThis fruit tree, of the order Sapotaceæ and a native of tropical\r\nAmerica, has been the subject of several mistakes in works on\r\nbotany.[1419] There exists no satisfactory and complete illustration of\r\nit as yet, because colonists and travellers think it is too well known\r\nto send selected specimens of it, such as may be described in herbaria.\r\nThis neglect is common enough in the case of cultivated plants. The\r\nmammee is cultivated in the West Indies and in some warm regions of\r\nAmerica. Sagot tells us it is grown in Venezuela, but not in\r\nCayenne.[1420] I do not find that it has been transported into Africa\r\nand Asia, the Philippines[1421] excepted. This is probably due to the\r\ninsipid taste of the fruit. Humboldt and Bonpland found it wild in the\r\nforests on the banks of the Orinoco.[1422] All authors mention it in the\r\nWest Indies, but as cultivated or without asserting that it is wild. In\r\nBrazil it is only a garden species.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Sapodilla+—_Sapota achras_, Miller.\r\n\r\nThe sapodilla is the most esteemed of the order Sapotaceæ, and one of\r\nthe best of tropical fruits. “An over-ripe sapodilla,” says Descourtilz,\r\nin his _Flore des Antilles_, “is melting, and has the sweet perfumes of\r\nhoney, jasmin, and lily of the valley.” There is a very good\r\nillustration in the _Botanical Magazine_, pls. 3111 and 3112, and in\r\nTussac, _Flore des Antilles_, i. pl. 5. It has been introduced into\r\ngardens in Mauritius, the Malay Archipelago, and India, from the time of\r\nRheede and Rumphius, but no one disputes its American origin. Several\r\nbotanists have seen it wild in the forests of the Isthmus of Panama, of\r\nCampeachy,[1423] of Venezuela,[1424] and perhaps of Trinidad.[1425] In\r\nJamaica, in the time of Sloane, it existed only in gardens.[1426] It is\r\nvery doubtful that it is wild in the other West India Islands, although\r\nperhaps the seeds, scattered here and there, may have naturalized it to\r\na certain degree. Tussac says that the young plants are not easy to rear\r\nin the plantations.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Aubergine+—_Solanum melongena_, Linnæus; _Solanum esculentum_, Dunal.\r\n\r\nThe aubergine has a Sanskrit name, _vartta_, and several names, which\r\nPiddington in his _Index_ considers as both Sanskrit and Bengali, such\r\nas _bong_, _bartakon_, _mahoti_, _hingoli_. Wallich, in his edition of\r\nRoxburgh’s _Indian Flora_, gives _vartta_, _varttakou_, _varttaka\r\nbunguna_, whence the Hindustani _bungan_. Hence it cannot be doubted\r\nthat the species has been known in India from a very remote epoch.\r\nRumphius had seen it in gardens in the Sunda Islands, and Loureiro in\r\nthose of Cochin-China. Thunberg does not mention it in Japan, though\r\nseveral varieties are now cultivated in that country. The Greeks and\r\nRomans did not know the species, and no botanist mentions it in Europe\r\nbefore the beginning of the seventeenth century,[1427] but its\r\ncultivation must have spread towards Africa before the Middle Ages. The\r\nArab physician, Ebn Baithar,[1428] who wrote in the thirteenth century,\r\nspeaks of it, and he quotes Rhasis, who lived in the ninth century.\r\nRauwolf[1429] had seen the plant in the gardens of Aleppo at the end of\r\nthe sixteenth century. It was called _melanzana_ and _bedengiam_. This\r\nArabic name, which Forskal writes _badinjan_, is the same as the\r\nHindustani _badanjan_, which Piddington gives. A sign of antiquity in\r\nNorthern Africa is the existence of a name, _tabendjalts_, among the\r\nBerbers or Kabyles of the province of Algiers,[1430] which differs\r\nconsiderably from the Arab word. Modern travellers have found the\r\naubergine cultivated in the whole of the Nile Valley and on the coast of\r\nGuinea.[1431] It has been transported into America.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated form of _Solanum melongena_ has not hitherto been found\r\nwild, but most botanists are agreed in regarding _Solanum insanum_,\r\nRoxburgh, and _S. incanum_, Linnæus, as belonging to the same species.\r\nOther synonyms are sometimes added, the result of a study made by Nees\r\nvon Esenbeck from numerous specimens.[1432] _S. insanum_ appears to have\r\nbeen lately found wild in the Madras presidency and at Tong-dong in\r\nBurmah. The publication of the article on the Solanaceæ in the _Flora of\r\nBritish India_, will probably give more precise information on this\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Red Pepper+—_Capsicum._ In the best botanical works the genus Capsicum\r\nis encumbered with a number of cultivated forms, which have never been\r\nfound wild, and which differ especially in their duration (which is\r\noften variable), or in the form of the fruit, a character which is of\r\nlittle value in plants cultivated for that special organ. I shall speak\r\nof the two species most often cultivated, but I cannot refrain from\r\nstating my opinion that no capsicum is indigenous to the old world. I\r\nbelieve them to be all of American origin, though I cannot absolutely\r\nprove it. These are my reasons.\r\n\r\nFruits so conspicuous, so easily grown in gardens, and so agreeable to\r\nthe palate of the inhabitants of hot countries, would have been very\r\nquickly diffused throughout the old world, if they had existed in the\r\nsouth of Asia, as it has sometimes been supposed. They would have had\r\nnames in several ancient languages. Yet neither Romans, Greeks, nor even\r\nHebrews were acquainted with them. They are not mentioned in ancient\r\nChinese books.[1433] The islanders of the Pacific did not cultivate them\r\nat the time of Cook’s voyages,[1434] in spite of their proximity to the\r\nSunda Isles, where Rumphius mentions their very general use. The Arabian\r\nphysician, Ebn Baithar, who collected in the thirteenth century all that\r\nEastern nations knew about medicinal plants, says nothing about it.\r\nRoxburgh knew no Sanskrit name for the capsicums. Later, Piddington\r\nmentions a name for _C. frutescens_, _bran-maricha_,[1435] which he says\r\nis Sanskrit; but this name, which may be compared to that of black\r\npepper (_muricha_, _murichung_), is probably not really ancient, for it\r\nhas left no trace in the Indian languages which are derived from\r\nSanskrit.[1436] The wild nature and ancient existence of the capsicum is\r\nalways uncertain, owing to its very general cultivation; but it seems to\r\nme to be more often doubtful in Asia than in South America. The Indian\r\nspecimens described by the most trustworthy authors nearly all come from\r\nthe herbaria of the East India Company, in which we never know whether a\r\nplant appeared really wild, if it was found far from dwellings, in\r\nforests, etc. For the localities in the Malay Archipelago authors often\r\ngive rubbish-heaps, hedges, etc. We pass to a more particular\r\nexamination of the two cultivated species.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Annual Capsicum+—_Capsicum annuum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis species has a number of different names in European\r\nlanguages,[1437] which all indicate a foreign origin and the resemblance\r\nof the taste to that of pepper. In French it is often called _poivre de\r\nGuinée_ (Guinea pepper), but also _poivre du Brézil_, _d’Inde_ (Indian,\r\nBrazilian pepper), etc., denominations to which no importance can be\r\nattributed. Its cultivation was introduced into Europe in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. It was one of the peppers that Piso and Marcgraf[1438] saw\r\ngrown in Brazil under the name _quija_ or _quiya_. They say nothing as\r\nto its origin. The species appears to have been early cultivated in the\r\nWest Indies, where it has several Carib names.[1439]\r\n\r\nBotanists who have most thoroughly studied the genus Capsicum[1440] do\r\nnot appear to have found in herbaria a single specimen which can be\r\nconsidered wild. I have not been more fortunate. The original home is\r\nprobably Brazil.\r\n\r\n_C. grossum_, Willdenow, seems to be a variety of the same species. It\r\nis cultivated in India under the name _kafree murich_, and _kafree\r\nchilly_, but Roxburgh did not consider it to be of Indian origin.[1441]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Shrubby Capsicum+—_Capsicum frutescens_, Willdenow.\r\n\r\nThis species, taller and with a more woody stock than _C. annuum_, is\r\ngenerally cultivated in the warm regions of both hemispheres. The great\r\npart of our so-called Cayenne pepper is made from it, but this name is\r\ngiven also to the product of other peppers. Roxburgh, the author who is\r\nmost attentive to the origin of Indian plants, does not consider it to\r\nbe wild in India. Blume says it is naturalized in the Malay Archipelago\r\nin hedges.[1442] In America, on the contrary, where its culture is\r\nancient, it has been several times found wild in forests, apparently\r\nindigenous. De Martius brought it from the banks of the Amazon, Pœppig\r\nfrom the province of Maynas in Peru, and Blanchet from the province of\r\nBahia.[1443] So that its area extends from Bahia to Eastern Peru, which\r\nexplains its diffusion over South America generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Tomato+—_Lycopersicum esculentum_, Miller.\r\n\r\nThe tomato, or love apple, belongs to a genus of the Solaneæ, of which\r\nall the species are American.[1444] It has no name in the ancient\r\nlanguages of Asia, nor even in modern Indian languages.[1445] It was not\r\ncultivated in Japan in the time of Thunberg, that is to say a century\r\nago, and the silence of ancient writers on China on this head shows that\r\nit is of recent introduction there. Rumphius[1446] had seen it in\r\ngardens in the Malay Archipelago. The Malays called it _tomatte_, but\r\nthis is an American name, for C. Bauhin calls the species _tumatle\r\nAmericanorum_. Nothing leads us to suppose it was known in Europe before\r\nthe discovery of America.\r\n\r\nThe first names given to it by botanists in the sixteenth century\r\nindicate that they received the plant from Peru.[1447] It was cultivated\r\non the continent of America before it was grown in the West India\r\nIslands, for Sloane does not mention it in Jamaica, and Hughes[1448]\r\nsays it was brought to Barbados from Portugal hardly more than a century\r\nago. Humboldt considered that the cultivation of the tomato was of\r\nancient date in Mexico.[1449] I notice, however, that the earliest work\r\non the plants of this country (Hernandez, _Historia_) makes no mention\r\nof it. Neither do the early writers on Brazil, Piso and Marcgraf, speak\r\nof it, although the species is now cultivated throughout tropical\r\nAmerica. Thus by the process of exhaustion we return to the idea of a\r\nPeruvian origin, at least for its cultivation.\r\n\r\nDe Martius[1450] found the plant wild in the neighbourhood of Rio de\r\nJaneiro and Para, but it had perhaps escaped from gardens. I do not know\r\nof any botanist who has found it really wild in the state in which it\r\nis familiar to us, with the fruit more or less large, lumpy, and with\r\nswelled sides; but this is not the case with the variety with small\r\nspherical fruit, called _L. cerasiforme_ in some botanical works, and\r\nconsidered in others (and rightly so, I think[1451]) as belonging to the\r\nsame species. This variety is wild on the sea-shore of Peru,[1452] at\r\nTarapoto, in Eastern Peru,[1453] and on the frontiers of Mexico and of\r\nthe United States towards California.[1454] It is sometimes naturalized\r\nin clearings near gardens.[1455] It is probably in this manner that its\r\narea has extended north and south from Peru.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Avocado+, or +Alligator Pear+—_Persea gratissima_, Gærtner.\r\n\r\nThe avocado pear is one of the most highly prized of tropical fruits. It\r\nbelongs to the order Laurineæ. It is like a pear containing one large\r\nstone, as is well shown in Tussac’s illustrations, _Flore des Antilles_,\r\niii. pl. 3, and in the _Botanical Magazine_, pl. 4580. The common names\r\nare absurd. The origin of that of _alligator_ is unknown; _avocado_ is a\r\ncorruption of the Mexican _ahuaca_, or _aguacate_. The botanical name\r\n_Persea_ has nothing to do with the _persea_ of the Greeks, which was a\r\n_Cordia_. Clusius,[1456] writing in 1601, says that the avocado pear is\r\nan American fruit tree introduced into a garden in Spain; but as it is\r\nwidely spread in the colonies of the old world, and has here and there\r\nbecome almost wild,[1457] it is possible to make mistakes as to its\r\norigin. This tree did not exist in the gardens of British India at the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century. It had been introduced into the\r\nSunda Isles[1458] in the middle of the eighteenth century, and in 1750\r\ninto Mauritius and Bourbon.[1459]\r\n\r\nIn America its actual area in a wild state is of uncommon extent. The\r\nspecies has been found in forests, on the banks of rivers, and on the\r\nsea-shore from Mexico and the West Indies as far as the Amazon.[1460] It\r\nhas not always occupied this vast region. P. Browne says distinctly\r\nthat the avocado pear was introduced from the Continent into Jamaica,\r\nand Jacquin held the same opinion as regards the West India Islands\r\ngenerally.[1461] Piso and Marcgraf do not mention it for Brazil, and\r\nMartius gives no Brazilian name.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the discovery of America, the species was certainly wild\r\nand cultivated in Mexico, according to Hernandez. Acosta[1462] says it\r\nwas cultivated in Peru under the name of _palto_, which was that of a\r\npeople of the eastern part of Peru, among whom it was abundant.[1463] I\r\nfind no proof that it was wild upon the Peruvian littoral.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Papaw+—_Carica Papaya_, Linnæus; _Papaya vulgaris_, de Candolle.\r\n\r\nThe papaw is a large herbaceous plant rather than a tree. It has a sort\r\nof juicy trunk terminated by a tuft of leaves, and the fruit, which is\r\nlike a melon, hangs down under the leaves.[1464] It is now grown in all\r\ntropical countries, even as far as thirty to thirty-two degrees of\r\nlatitude. It is easily naturalized outside plantations. This is one\r\nreason why it has been said, and people still say that it is a native of\r\nAsia or of Africa, whereas Robert Brown and I proved in 1848 and 1855\r\nits American origin.[1465] I repeat the arguments against its supposed\r\norigin in the eastern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe species has no Sanskrit name. In modern Indian languages it bears\r\nnames derived from the American word _papaya_, itself a corruption of\r\nthe Carib _ababai_.[1466] Rumphius[1467] says that the inhabitants of\r\nthe Malay Archipelago considered it as an exotic plant introduced by\r\nthe Portuguese, and gave it names expressing its likeness to other\r\nspecies or its foreign extraction. Sloane,[1468] in the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century, quotes several of his contemporaries, who mention\r\nthat it was taken from the West Indies into Asia and Africa. Forster had\r\nnot seen it in the plantations of the Pacific Isles at the time of\r\nCook’s voyages. Loureiro,[1469] in the middle of the eighteenth century,\r\nhad seen it in cultivation in China, Cochin-China, and Zanzibar. So\r\nuseful and so striking a plant would have been spread throughout the old\r\nworld for thousands of years if it had existed there. Everything leads\r\nto the belief that it was introduced on the coasts of Africa and Asia\r\nafter the discovery of America.\r\n\r\nAll the species of the family are American. This one seems to have been\r\ncultivated from Brazil to the West Indies, and in Mexico before the\r\narrival of the Europeans, since the earliest writers on the productions\r\nof the new world mention it.[1470]\r\n\r\nMarcgraf had often seen the male plant (always commoner than the female)\r\nin the forests of Brazil, while the female plants were in gardens.\r\nClusius, who was the first to give an illustration of the plant,\r\nsays[1471] that his drawing was made in 1607, in the bay of Todos Santos\r\n(province of Bahia). I know of no modern author who has confirmed the\r\nhabitation in Brazil. Martius does not mention the species in his\r\ndictionary of the names of fruits in the language of the Tupis.[1472] It\r\nis not given as wild in Guiana and Columbia. P. Browne[1473] asserts, on\r\nthe other hand, that it is wild in Jamaica, and before his time Ximenes\r\nand Hernandez said the same for St. Domingo and Mexico. Oviedo[1474]\r\nseems to have seen the papaw in Central America, and he gives the common\r\nname _olocoton_ for Nicaragua. Yet Correa de Mello and Spruce, in their\r\nimportant article on the _Papayaceæ_, after having botanized extensively\r\nin the Amazon region, in Peru and elsewhere, consider the papaw as a\r\nnative of the West Indies, and do not think it is anywhere wild upon the\r\nContinent. I have seen[1475] specimens from the mouth of the river\r\nManatee in Florida, from Puebla in Mexico, and from Columbia, but the\r\nlabels had no remark as to their wild character. The indications, it\r\nwill be noticed, are numerous for the shores of the Gulf of Mexico and\r\nfor the West Indies. The habitation in Brazil which lies apart is very\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Fig+—_Ficus carica_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe history of the fig presents a close analogy with that of the olive\r\nin point of origin and geographical limits. Its area as a wild species\r\nmay have been extended by the dispersal of the seeds as cultivation\r\nspread. This seems probable, as the seeds pass intact through the\r\ndigestive organs of men and animals. However, countries may be cited\r\nwhere the fig has been cultivated for a century at least, and where no\r\nsuch naturalization has taken place. I am not speaking of Europe north\r\nof the Alps, where the tree demands particular care and the fruit ripens\r\nwith difficulty, even the first crop, but of India for instance, the\r\nSouthern States of America, Mauritius, and Chili, where, to judge from\r\nthe silence of compilers of floras, the instances of quasi-wildness are\r\nrare. In our own day the fig tree grows wild, or nearly wild, over a\r\nvast region of which Syria is about the centre; that is to say, from the\r\neast of Persia, or even from Afghanistan, across the whole of the\r\nMediterranean region as far as the Canaries.[1476] From north to south\r\nthis zone varies in width from the 25th to the 40th or 42nd parallel,\r\naccording to local circumstances. As a rule, the fig stops like the\r\nolive at the foot of the Caucasus and the mountains of Europe which\r\nlimit the Mediterranean basin, but it grows nearly wild on the\r\nsouth-west coast of France, where the winter is very mild.[1477]\r\n\r\nWe turn to historical and philological records to see whether the area\r\nwas more limited in antiquity. The ancient Egyptians called the fig\r\n_teb_,[1478] and the earliest Hebrew books speak of the fig, whether\r\nwild or cultivated, under the name _teenah_,[1479] which leaves its\r\ntrace in the Arabic _tin_.[1480] The Persian name is quite different,\r\n_unjir_; but I do not know if it dates from the Zend. Piddington’s\r\n_Index_ has a Sanskrit name, _udumvara_, which Roxburgh, who is very\r\ncareful in such matters, does not give, and which has left no trace in\r\nmodern Indian languages, to judge from four names quoted by authors. The\r\nantiquity of its existence east of Persia appears to me doubtful, until\r\nthe Sanskrit name is verified. The Chinese received the fig tree from\r\nPersia, but only in the eighth century of our era.[1481] Herodotus[1482]\r\nsays the Persians did not lack figs, and Reynier, who has made careful\r\nresearches into the customs of this ancient people, does not mention the\r\nfig tree. This only proves that the species was not utilized and\r\ncultivated, but it perhaps existed in a wild state.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks called the wild fig _erineos_, and the Latins _caprificus_.\r\nHomer mentions a fig tree in the _Iliad_ which grew near Troy.[1483]\r\nHehn asserts[1484] that the cultivated fig cannot have been developed\r\nfrom the wild fig, but all botanists hold a contrary opinion;[1485] and,\r\nwithout speaking of floral details on which they rely, I may say that\r\nGussone obtained from the same seeds plants of the form _caprificus_,\r\nand other varieties.[1486] The remark made by several scholars as to the\r\nabsence of all mention of the cultivated fig _sukai_ in the _Iliad_,\r\ndoes not therefore prove the absence of the fig tree in Greece at the\r\ntime of the Trojan war. Homer mentions the sweet fig in the _Odyssey_,\r\nand that but vaguely. Hesiod, says Hehn, does not mention it, and\r\nArchilochus (700 B.C.) is the first to mention distinctly its\r\ncultivation by the Greeks of Paros. According to this, the species grew\r\nwild in Greece, at least in the Archipelago, before the introduction of\r\ncultivated varieties of Asiatic origin. Theophrastus and Dioscorides\r\nmention wild and cultivated figs.[1487]\r\n\r\nRomulus and Remus, according to tradition, were nursed at the foot of a\r\nfig tree called _ruminalis_, from _rumen_, breast or udder.[1488] The\r\nLatin name, _ficus_, which Hehn derives, by an effort of erudition, from\r\nthe Greek _sukai_,[1489] also argues an ancient existence in Italy, and\r\nPliny’s opinion is positive on this head. The good cultivated varieties\r\nwere of later introduction. They came from Greece, Syria, and Asia\r\nMinor. In the time of Tiberius, as now, the best figs came from the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nWe learnt at school how Cato exhibited to the assembled senators\r\nCarthaginian figs, still fresh, as a proof of the proximity of the hated\r\ncountry. The Phœnicians must have transported good varieties to the\r\ncoast of Africa and their other colonies on the Mediterranean, even as\r\nfar as the Canaries, where, however, the wild fig may have already\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nFor the Canaries we have a proof in the Guanchos words, _arahormaze_ and\r\n_achormaze_, green figs, _taharemenen_ and _tehahunemen_, dried figs.\r\nWebb and Berthelot,[1490] who quote these names, and who admit the\r\ncommon origin of the Guanchos and Berbers, would have noted with\r\npleasure the existence among the Touaregs, a Berber people, of the word\r\n_tahart_, fig tree,[1491] and in the French-Berber dictionary, published\r\nsince their time, the names _tabeksist_, green fig, and _tagrourt_, fig\r\ntree. These old names, of more ancient and local origin than Arabic,\r\nbear witness to a very ancient habitation in the north of Africa as far\r\nas the Canaries.\r\n\r\nThe result of our inquiry shows, then, that the prehistoric area of the\r\nfig tree covered the middle and southern part of the Mediterranean basin\r\nfrom Syria to the Canaries.\r\n\r\nWe may doubt the antiquity of the fig in the south of France, but a\r\ncurious fact deserves mention. Planchon found in the quaternary tufa of\r\nMontpellier, and de Saporta[1492] in those of Aygalades near Marseilles,\r\nand in the quaternary strata of La Celle near Paris, leaves and even\r\nfruit of the wild _Ficus carica_, with teeth of _Elephas primigenius_,\r\nand leaves of plants of which some no longer exist, and others, like\r\n_Laurus canariensis_, have survived in the Canaries. So that the fig\r\ntree perhaps existed in its modern form in this remote epoch. It is\r\npossible that it perished in the south of France, as it certainly did at\r\nParis, and reappeared later in a wild state in the southern region.\r\nPerhaps the fig trees which Webb and Berthelot had seen as old plants in\r\nthe wildest part of the Canaries were descended from those which\r\nexisted in the fourth epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Bread-Fruit+—_Artocarpus incisa_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe bread-fruit tree was cultivated in all the islands of the Asiatic\r\nArchipelago, and of the great oceans near the equator, from Sumatra to\r\nthe Marquesas Isles, when first Europeans began to visit them. Its fruit\r\nis constituted, like the pine-apple, of an assemblage of bracts and\r\nfruits welded into a fleshy mass, more or less spherical; and as in the\r\npine-apple, the seeds come to nothing in the most productive cultivated\r\nvarieties.[1493]\r\n\r\nSonnerat[1494] carried the bread-fruit tree to Mauritius, where the\r\nIntendant Poivre took care to spread it. Captain Bligh was commissioned\r\nto introduce it into the English West Indian Isles. The mutiny of his\r\ncrew prevented his succeeding the first time, but a second attempt\r\nproved more fortunate. In January, 1793, he landed 153 plants at St.\r\nVincent, whence the species has been diffused into several parts of\r\ntropical America.[1495]\r\n\r\nRumphius[1496] saw the species wild in several of the Sunda Isles.\r\nModern authors, less careful, or acquainted only with cultivated\r\nspecies, say nothing on this head. Seemann[1497] says for the Fiji\r\nIsles, “cultivated, and to all appearance wild in some places.” On the\r\ncontinent of Asia it is not even cultivated, as the climate is not hot\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThe bread-fruit is evidently a native of Java, Amboyna, and the\r\nneighbouring islands; but the antiquity of its cultivation in the whole\r\nof the archipelago, proved by the number of varieties, and the facility\r\nof propagating it by buds and suckers, prevent us from knowing its\r\nhistory accurately. In the islands to the extreme east, like Otahiti,\r\ncertain fables and traditions point to an introduction which is not very\r\nancient, and the absence of seeds confirms this.[1498]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Jack-Fruit+—_Artocarpus integrifolia_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe jack-fruit, larger than the bread-fruit, for it sometimes weighs as\r\nmuch as eighty pounds, hangs from the branches of a tree thirty to fifty\r\nfeet high.[1499] The common name is derived from the Indian names\r\n_jaca_, or _tsjaka_.\r\n\r\nThe species has long been cultivated in southern Asia, from the Punjab\r\nto China, from the Himalayas to the Moluccas. It has not spread into the\r\nsmall islands more to the east, such as Otahiti, which leads us to\r\nsuppose it has not been so long in the archipelago as upon the\r\ncontinent. In the north-west of India, also, its cultivation does not\r\nperhaps date from a very remote epoch, for the existence of a Sanskrit\r\nname is not absolutely certain. Roxburgh mentions one, _punusa_, but\r\nPiddington does not admit it into his _Index_. The Persians and the\r\nArabs do not seem to have known the species. Its enormous fruit must,\r\nhowever, have struck them if the species had been cultivated near their\r\nfrontiers. Dr. Bretschneider does not speak of any Artocarpus in his\r\nwork on the plants known to the ancient Chinese, whence it may be\r\ninferred that towards China, as in other directions, the jack-fruit was\r\nnot diffused at a very early epoch. The first statement as to its\r\nexistence in a wild state is given by Rheede in ambiguous terms: “This\r\ntree grows everywhere in Malabar and throughout India.” He perhaps\r\nconfounded the planted tree with the wild one. After him, however, Wight\r\nfound the species several times in the Indian Peninsula, notably in the\r\nWestern Ghauts, with every appearance of a wild and indigenous tree. It\r\nhas been extensively planted in Ceylon; but Thwaites, the best authority\r\nfor the flora of this island, does not recognize it as wild. Neither is\r\nit wild in the archipelago to the south of India, according to the\r\ngeneral opinion. Lastly, Brandis found it growing in the forests of the\r\ndistrict of Attaran, in Burmah, but, he adds, always in the\r\nneighbourhood of abandoned settlements. Kurz did not find it wild in\r\nBritish Burmah.[1500]\r\n\r\nThe species is, therefore, a native of the region lying at the foot of\r\nthe western mountains of the Indian Peninsula, and its cultivation in\r\nthe neighbourhood is probably not earlier than the Christian era. It was\r\nintroduced into Jamaica by Admiral Rodney in 1782, and thence into San\r\nDomingo.[1501] It has also been introduced into Brazil, Mauritius, the\r\nSeychelles, and Rodriguez Island.[1502]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Date-Palm+—_Phœnix dactylifera_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe date-palm has existed from prehistoric times in the warm dry zone,\r\nwhich extends from Senegal to the basin of the Indus, principally\r\nbetween parallels 15 and 30. It is seen here and there further to the\r\nnorth, by reason of exceptional circumstances and of the aim which is\r\nproposed in its cultivation. For beyond the limit within which the fruit\r\nripens every year, there is a zone in which they ripen ill or seldom,\r\nand a further region within which the tree can live, but without\r\nfruiting or even flowering. These limits have been traced by de Martius,\r\nCarl Ritter, and myself.[1503] It is needless to reproduce them here,\r\nthe aim of the present work being to study questions of origin.\r\n\r\nAs regards the date-palm, we can hardly rely on the more or less proved\r\nexistence of really wild indigenous individuals. Dates are easily\r\ntransported; the stones germinate when sown in damp soil near the source\r\nof a river, and even in the fissures of rocks. The inhabitants of oases\r\nhave planted or sown date-palms in favourable localities where the\r\nspecies perhaps existed before man, and when the traveller comes across\r\nisolated trees, at a distance from dwellings, he cannot know that they\r\ndid not spring from stones thrown away by caravans. Botanists admit a\r\nvariety, _sylvestris_, that is to say wild, with small and sour fruit;\r\nbut it is perhaps the result of recent naturalization in an unfavourable\r\nsoil. Historical and philological data are of more value here, though\r\ndoubtless from the antiquity of cultivation they can only establish\r\nprobabilities.\r\n\r\nFrom Egyptian and Assyrian remains, as well as from tradition and the\r\nmost ancient writings, we find that the date-palm grew in abundance in\r\nthe region lying between the Euphrates and the Nile. Egyptian monuments\r\ncontain fruits and drawings of the tree.[1504] Herodotus, in a more\r\nrecent age (fifth century before Christ), mentions the wood of the\r\ndate-palms of Babylonia, and still later Strabo used similar expressions\r\nabout those of Arabia, whence it seems that the species was commoner\r\nthan it is now, and more in the condition of a natural forest tree. On\r\nthe other hand, Carl Ritter makes the ingenious observation that the\r\nearliest Hebrew books do not speak of the date-palm as producing a fruit\r\nvalued as a food for man. David, about one thousand years before Christ,\r\nand about seven centuries after Moses, does not mention the date palm in\r\nhis list of trees to be planted in his gardens. It is true that except\r\nat Jericho dates seldom ripen in Palestine. Later, Herodotus says of the\r\nBabylonian date-palms that only the greater part produced good fruit\r\nwhich was used for food. This seems to indicate the beginning of a\r\ncultivation perfected by the selection of varieties and of the transport\r\nof male flowers into the middle of the branches of female trees, but it\r\nperhaps signifies also that Herodotus was ignorant of the existence of\r\nthe male plant.\r\n\r\nTo the west of Egypt the date-palm had probably existed for centuries\r\nor for thousands of years when Herodotus mentioned them. He speaks of\r\nLibya. There is no historical record with respect to the oases in the\r\nSahara, but Pliny[1505] mentions the date-palm in the Canaries.\r\n\r\nThe names of the species bear witness to its great antiquity both in\r\nAsia and in Africa, seeing they are numerous and very different. The\r\nHebrews called the date-palm _tamar_, and the ancient Egyptians\r\n_beq_.[1506] The complete difference between these words, both very\r\nancient, shows that these peoples found the species indigenous and\r\nperhaps already named in Western Asia and in Egypt. The number of\r\nPersian, Arabic, and Berber names is incredible.[1507] Some are derived\r\nfrom the Hebrew word, others from unknown sources. They often apply to\r\ndifferent states of the fruit, or to different cultivated varieties,\r\nwhich again shows ancient cultivation in different countries. Webb and\r\nBerthelot have not discovered a name for the date-palm in the language\r\nof the Guanchos, and this is much to be regretted. The Greek name,\r\n_phœnix_, refers simply to Phœnicia and the Phœnicians, possessors of\r\nthe date-palm.[1508] The names _dactylus_ and _date_ are derivations of\r\n_dachel_ in a Hebrew dialect.[1509] No Sanskrit name is known, whence it\r\nmay be inferred that the plantations of the date-palm in Western India\r\nare not very ancient. The Indian climate does not suit the\r\nspecies.[1510] The Hindustani name _khurma_ is borrowed from the\r\nPersian.\r\n\r\nFurther to the East the date-palm remained long unknown. The Chinese\r\nreceived it from Persia, in the third century of our era, and its\r\ncultivation was resumed at different times, but they have now abandoned\r\nit.[1511] As a rule, beyond the arid region which lies between the\r\nEuphrates and the south of the Atlas and the Canaries, the date-palm has\r\nnot succeeded in similar latitudes, or at least it has not become an\r\nimportant culture. It might be grown with success in Australia and at\r\nthe Cape, but the Europeans who have colonized these regions are not\r\nsatisfied, like the Arabs, with figs and dates for their staple food. I\r\nthink, in fine, that in times anterior to the earliest Egyptian\r\ndynasties the date-palm already existed, wild or sown here and there by\r\nwandering tribes, in a narrow zone extending from the Euphrates to the\r\nCanaries, and that its cultivation began later as far as the north-west\r\nof India on the one hand and the Cape de Verde Islands[1512] on the\r\nother, so that the natural area has remained very nearly the same for\r\nabout five thousand years. What it was previously, palæontological\r\ndiscoveries may one day reveal.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Banana+—_Musa sapientum_ and _M. paradisiaca_, Linnæus; _M. sapientum_,\r\nBrown.\r\n\r\nThe banana or bananas were generally considered to be natives of\r\nSouthern Asia, and to have been carried into America by Europeans, till\r\nHumboldt threw doubts upon their purely Asiatic origin. In his work on\r\nNew Spain[1513] he quoted early authors who assert that the banana was\r\ncultivated in America before the conquest.\r\n\r\nHe admits, on Oviedo’s authority,[1514] its introduction by Father\r\nThomas of Berlangas from the Canaries into San Domingo in 1516, whence\r\nit was introduced into other islands and the mainland.[1515] He\r\nrecognizes the absence of any mention of the banana in the accounts of\r\nColumbus, Alonzo Negro, Pinzon, Vespuzzi, and Cortez. The silence of\r\nHernandez, who lived half a century after Oviedo, astonishes him and\r\nappears to him a remarkable carelessness; “for,” he says,[1516] “it is a\r\nconstant tradition in Mexico and on the whole of the mainland that the\r\n_platano arton_, and the _dominico_ were cultivated long before the\r\nSpanish conquest.” The author who has most carefully noted the different\r\nepochs at which American agriculture has been enriched by foreign\r\nproducts, the Peruvian Garcilasso de la Vega,[1517] says distinctly that\r\nat the time of the Incas, maize, quinoa, the potato, and, in the warm\r\nand temperate regions, bananas formed the staple food of the natives.\r\nHe describes the _Musa_ of the valleys in the Andes; he even\r\ndistinguishes the rarer species, with a small fruit and a sweet aromatic\r\nflavour, the _dominico_, from the common banana or _arton_. Father\r\nAcosta[1518] asserts also, although less positively, that the _Musa_ was\r\ncultivated by the Americans before the arrival of the Spaniards. Lastly,\r\nHumboldt adds from his own observation, “On the banks of the Orinoco, of\r\nthe Cassiquaire or of the Beni, between the mountains of Esmeralda and\r\nthe banks of the river Carony, in the midst of the thickest forests,\r\nalmost everywhere that Indian tribes are found who have had no relations\r\nwith European settlements, we meet with plantations of Manioc and\r\nbananas.” Humboldt suggests the hypothesis that several species or\r\nconstant varieties of the Banana have been confounded, some of which are\r\nindigenous to the new world.\r\n\r\nDesvaux studied the specific question, and in a really remarkable work,\r\npublished in 1814,[1519] he gives it as his opinion that all the bananas\r\ncultivated for their fruits are of the same species. In this species he\r\ndistinguishes forty-four varieties, which he arranges in two groups; the\r\nlarge-fruited bananas (seven to fifteen inches long), and the\r\nsmall-fruited bananas (one to six inches), commonly called fig bananas.\r\nR. Brown, in 1818, in his work on the _Plants of the Congo_, p. 51,\r\nmaintains also that no structural difference in the bananas cultivated\r\nin Asia and those in America prevents us from considering them as\r\nbelonging to the same species. He adopts the name _Musa sapientum_,\r\nwhich appears to me preferable to that of _M. paradisiaca_ adopted by\r\nDesvaux, because the varieties with small fertile fruit appear to be\r\nnearer the condition of the wild _Musæ_ found in Asia.\r\n\r\nBrown remarks on the question of origin that all the other species of\r\nthe genus _Musa_ belong to the old world; that no one pretends to have\r\nfound in America, in a wild state, varieties with fertile fruit, as has\r\nhappened in Asia; lastly, that Piso and Marcgraf considered that the\r\nbanana was introduced into Brazil from Congo. In spite of the force of\r\nthese three arguments, Humboldt, in his second edition of his essay upon\r\nNew Spain (ii. p. 397), does not entirely renounce his opinion. He says\r\nthat the traveller Caldcleugh[1520] found among the Puris the tradition\r\nthat a small species of banana was cultivated on the borders of the\r\nPrato long before they had any communications with the Portuguese. He\r\nadds that words which are not borrowed ones are found in American\r\nlanguages to distinguish the fruit of the _Musa_; for instance, _paruru_\r\nin Tamanac, etc., _arata_ in Maypur. I have also read in Stevenson’s\r\ntravels[1521] that beds of the leaves of the two bananas commonly\r\ncultivated in America have been found in the _huacas_ or Peruvian tombs\r\nanterior to the conquest; but as this traveller also says that he saw\r\nbeans[1522] in these _huacas_, a plant which undoubtedly belongs to the\r\nold world, his assertions are not very trustworthy.\r\n\r\nBoussingault[1523] thought that the _platano arton_ at least was of\r\nAmerican origin, but he gives no proof. Meyen, who had also been in\r\nAmerica, adds no argument to those which were already known;[1524] nor\r\ndoes the geographer Ritter,[1525] who simply reproduces the facts about\r\nAmerica, given by Humboldt.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the botanists who have more recently visited America\r\nhave no hesitation as to the Asiatic origin. I may name Seemann for the\r\nIsthmus of Panama, Ernst for Venezuela, and Sagot for Guiana.[1526] The\r\ntwo first insist upon the absence of names for the banana in the\r\nlanguages of Peru and Mexico. Piso knew no Brazilian name. Martius[1527]\r\nhas since indicated, in the Tupi language of Brazil, the names _pacoba_\r\nor _bacoba_. This same word _bacove_ is used, according to Sagot, by the\r\nFrench in Guiana. It is perhaps derived from the name _bala_, or\r\n_palan_, of Malabar, from an introduction by the Portuguese, subsequent\r\nto Piso’s voyage.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity and wild character of the banana in Asia are incontestable\r\nfacts. There are several Sanskrit names.[1528] The Greeks, Latins, and\r\nArabs have mentioned it as a remarkable Indian fruit tree. Pliny[1529]\r\nspeaks of it distinctly. He says that the Greeks of the expedition of\r\nAlexander saw it in India, and he quotes the name _pala_ which still\r\npersists in Malabar. Sages reposed beneath its shade and ate of its\r\nfruit. Hence the botanical name _Musa sapientum_. _Musa_ is from the\r\nArabic _mouz_ or _mauwz_, which we find as early as the thirteenth\r\ncentury in Ebn Baithar. The specific name _paradisiaca_ comes from the\r\nridiculous hypothesis which made the banana figure in the story of Eve\r\nand of Paradise.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that the Hebrews and the ancient Egyptians[1530]\r\ndid not know this Indian plant. It is a sign that it did not exist in\r\nIndia from a very remote epoch, but was first a native of the Malay\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\nThere is an immense number of varieties of the banana in the south of\r\nAsia, both on the islands and on the continent; the cultivation of these\r\nvarieties dates in India, in China, and in the archipelago, from an\r\nepoch impossible to realize; it even spread formerly into the islands of\r\nthe Pacific[1531] and to the west coast of Africa;[1532] lastly, the\r\nvarieties bore distinct names in the most separate Asiatic languages,\r\nsuch as Chinese, Sanskrit, and Malay. All this indicates great antiquity\r\nof culture, consequently a primitive existence in Asia, and a diffusion\r\ncontemporary with or even anterior to that of the human races.\r\n\r\nThe banana is said to have been found wild in several places. This is\r\nthe more worthy of attention since the cultivated varieties seldom\r\nproduce seed, and are multiplied by division, so that the species can\r\nhardly have become naturalized from cultivation by sowing itself.\r\nRoxburgh had seen it in the forests of Chittagong,[1533] in the form of\r\n_Musa sapientum_. Rumphius[1534] describes a wild variety with small\r\nfruits in the Philippine Isles. Loureiro[1535][1536] probably speaks of\r\nthe same form by the name _M. seminifera agrestis_, which he contrasts\r\nwith _M. seminifera domestica_, which is wild in Cochin-China. Blanco\r\nalso mentions a wild banana in the Philippines,[1537] but his\r\ndescription is vague. Finlayson[1538] found the banana wild in abundance\r\nin the little island of Pulo Ubi at the southern extremity of Siam.\r\nThwaites[1539] saw the variety _M. sapientum_ in the rocky forests of\r\nthe centre of Ceylon, and does not hesitate to pronounce it the original\r\nstock of the cultivated bananas. Sir Joseph Hooker and Thomson[1540]\r\nfound it wild at Khasia.\r\n\r\nThe facts are quite different in America. The wild banana has been seen\r\nnowhere except in Barbados,[1541] but here it is a tree of which the\r\nfruit does not ripen, and which is, consequently, in all probability the\r\nresult of cultivated varieties of which the seed is not abundant.\r\nSloane’s _wild plantain_[1542] appears to be a plant very different to\r\nthe _musa_. The varieties which are supposed to be possibly indigenous\r\nin America are only two, and as a rule far fewer varieties are grown\r\nthan in Asia. The culture of the banana may be said to be recent in the\r\ngreater part of America, for it dates from but little more than three\r\ncenturies. Piso[1543] says positively that it was imported into Brazil,\r\nand has no Brazilian name. He does not say whence it came. We have seen\r\nthat, according to Oviedo, the species was brought to San Domingo from\r\nthe Canaries. This fact and the silence of Hernandez, generally so\r\naccurate about the useful plants, wild or cultivated, in Mexico,\r\nconvince me that at the time of the discovery of America the banana did\r\nnot exist in the whole of the eastern part of the continent.\r\n\r\nDid it exist, then, in the western part on the shores of the Pacific?\r\nThis seems very unlikely when we reflect that communication was easy\r\nbetween the two coasts towards the isthmus of Panama, and that before\r\nthe arrival of the Europeans the natives had been active in diffusing\r\nthroughout America useful plants like the manioc, maize, and the potato.\r\nThe banana, which they have prized so highly for three centuries, which\r\nis so easily multiplied by suckers, and whose appearance must strike the\r\nleast observant, would not have been forgotten in a few villages in the\r\ndepths of the forest or upon the littoral.\r\n\r\nI admit that the opinion of Garcilasso, descendant of the Incas, an\r\nauthor who lived from 1530 to 1568, has a certain importance when he\r\nsays that the natives knew the banana before the conquest. However, the\r\nexpressions of another writer, extremely worthy of attention, Joseph\r\nAcosta, who had been in Peru, and whom Humboldt quotes in support of\r\nGarcilasso, incline me to adopt the contrary opinion.[1544] He\r\nsays,[1545] “The reason the Spaniards called it _plane_ (for the natives\r\nhad no such name) was that, as in the case of their trees, they found\r\nsome resemblance between them.” He goes on to show how different was the\r\n_plane_ (_Platanus_) of the ancients. He describes the banana very well,\r\nand adds that the tree is very common in the Indies (_i.e._ America),\r\n“although they (the Indians) say that its origin is Ethiopia.... There\r\nis a small white species of plantain (banana), very delicate, which is\r\ncalled in Espagnolle[1546] _dominico_. There are others coarser and\r\nlarger, and of a red colour. There are none in Peru, but they are\r\nimported thither from the Indies,[1547] as into Mexico from Cuernavaca\r\nand the other valleys. On the continent and in some of the islands there\r\nare great plantations of them which form dense thickets.” Surely it is\r\nnot thus that the author would express himself were he writing of a\r\nfruit tree of American origin. He would quote American names and\r\ncustoms; above all, he would not say that the natives regarded it as a\r\nplant of foreign origin. Its diffusion in the warm regions of Mexico may\r\nwell have taken place between the epoch of the conquest and the time\r\nwhen Acosta wrote, since Hernandez, whose conscientious researches go\r\nback to the earliest times of the Spanish dominion in Mexico (though\r\npublished later in Rome), says not a word of the banana.[1548] Prescott\r\nthe historian saw ancient books and manuscripts which assert that the\r\ninhabitants of Tumbez brought bananas to Pizarro when he disembarked\r\nupon the Peruvian coast, and he believes that its leaves were found in\r\nthe _huacas_, but he does not give his proofs.[1549]\r\n\r\nAs regards the argument of the modern native plantations in regions of\r\nAmerica, remote from European settlements, I find it hard to believe\r\nthat tribes have remained absolutely isolated, and have not received so\r\nuseful a tree from colonized districts.\r\n\r\nBriefly, then, it appears to me most probable that the species was early\r\nintroduced by the Spanish and Portuguese into San Domingo and Brazil,\r\nand I confess that this implies that Garcilasso was in error with regard\r\nto Peruvian traditions. If, however, later research should prove that\r\nthe banana existed in some parts of America before the advent of the\r\nEuropeans, I should be inclined to attribute it to a chance\r\nintroduction, not very ancient, the effect of some unknown communication\r\nwith the islands of the Pacific, or with the coast of Guinea, rather\r\nthan to believe in the primitive and simultaneous existence of the\r\nspecies in both hemispheres. The whole of geographical botany renders\r\nthe latter hypothesis improbable, I might almost say impossible, to\r\nadmit, especially in a genus which is not divided between the two\r\nworlds.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would call attention to the remarkable way in which the\r\ndistribution of varieties favours the opinion of a single species—an\r\nopinion adopted, purely from the botanical point of view, by Roxburgh,\r\nDesvaux, and R. Brown. If there were two or three species, one would\r\nprobably be represented by the varieties suspected to be of American\r\norigin, the other would belong, for instance, to the Malay Archipelago\r\nor to China, and the third to India. On the contrary all the varieties\r\nare geographically intermixed, and the two which are most widely\r\ndiffused in America differ sensibly the one from the other, and each is\r\nconfounded with or approaches very nearly to Asiatic varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Pine-Apple+—_Ananassa sativa_, Lindley; _Bromelia Ananas_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the doubts of a few writers, the pine-apple must be an\r\nAmerican plant, early introduced by Europeans into Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\n_Nana_ was the Brazilian name,[1550] which the Portuguese turned into\r\n_ananas_. The Spanish called it _pinas_, because the shape resembles the\r\nfruit of a species of pine.[1551] All early writers on America mention\r\nit.[1552] Hernandez says that the pine-apple grows in the warm regions\r\nof Haiti and Mexico. He mentions a Mexican name, _matzatli_. A\r\npine-apple was brought to Charles V., who mistrusted it, and would not\r\ntaste it.\r\n\r\nThe works of the Greeks, Romans, and Arabs make no allusion to this\r\nspecies, which was evidently introduced into the old world after the\r\ndiscovery of America. Rheede[1553] in the seventeenth century was\r\npersuaded of this; but Rumphius[1554] disputed it later, because he said\r\nthe pine-apple was cultivated in his time in every part of India, and\r\nwas found wild in Celebes and elsewhere. He notices, however, the\r\nabsence of an Asiatic name. That given by Rheede for Malabar is\r\nevidently taken from a comparison with the jack-fruit, and is in no\r\nsense original. It is doubtless a mistake on the part of Piddington to\r\nattribute a Sanskrit name to the pine-apple, as the name _anarush_ seems\r\nto be a corruption of _ananas_. Roxburgh knew of none, and Wilson’s\r\ndictionary does not mention the word _anarush_. Royle[1555] says that\r\nthe pine-apple was introduced into Bengal in 1594. Kircher[1556] says\r\nthat the Chinese cultivated it in the seventeenth century, but it was\r\nbelieved to have been brought to them from Peru.\r\n\r\nClusius[1557] in 1599 had seen leaves of the pine-apple brought from the\r\ncoast of Guinea. This may be explained by an introduction there\r\nsubsequent to the discovery of America. Robert Brown speaks of the\r\npine-apple among the plants cultivated in Congo; but he considers the\r\nspecies to be an American one.\r\n\r\nAlthough the cultivated pine-apple bears few seeds or none at all, it\r\noccasionally becomes naturalized in hot countries. Examples are quoted\r\nin Mauritius, the Seychelles, and Rodriguez Island,[1558] in\r\nIndia,[1559] in the Malay Archipelago, and in some parts of America,\r\nwhere it was probably not indigenous—the West Indies, for instance.\r\n\r\nIt has been found wild in the warm regions of Mexico (if we may trust\r\nthe phrase used by Hernandez), in the province of Veraguas[1560] near\r\nPanama, in the upper Orinoco valley,[1561] in Guiana[1562] and the\r\nprovince of Bahia.[1563]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPLANTS CULTIVATED FOR THEIR SEEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Article I._—Seeds used for Food.\r\n\r\n+Cacao+—_Theobroma Cacao_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Theobroma_, of the order _Byttneriaceæ_, allied to the\r\n_Malvaceæ_, consists of fifteen to eighteen species, all belonging to\r\ntropical America, principally in the hotter parts of Brazil, Guiana, and\r\nCentral America.\r\n\r\nThe common cacao, _Theobroma Cacao_, is a small tree wild in the forests\r\nof the Amazon and Orinoco basins[1564] and of their tributaries up to\r\nfour hundred feet of altitude. It is also said to grow wild in Trinidad,\r\nwhich lies near the mouth of the Orinoco.[1565] I find no proof that it\r\nis indigenous in Guiana, although it seems probable. Many early writers\r\nindicate that it was both wild and cultivated at the time of the\r\ndiscovery of America from Panama to Guatemala and Campeachy; but from\r\nthe numerous quotations collected by Sloane,[1566] it is to be feared\r\nthat its wild character was not sufficiently verified. Modern botanists\r\nare not very explicit on this head, and in general they only mention the\r\ncacao as cultivated in these regions and in the West India Islands. G.\r\nBernoulli,[1567] who had resided in Guatemala, only says, “wild and\r\ncultivated throughout tropical America;” and Hemsley,[1568] in his\r\nreview of the plants of Mexico and Central America, made in 1879 from\r\nthe rich materials of the Kew herbarium, gives no locality where the\r\nspecies is indigenous. It was perhaps introduced into Central America\r\nand into the warm regions of Mexico by the Indians before the discovery\r\nof America. Cultivation may have naturalized it here and there, as is\r\nsaid to be the case in Jamaica.[1569] In support of this hypothesis, it\r\nmust be observed that Triana[1570] indicates the cacao as only\r\ncultivated in the warm regions of New Granada, a country situated\r\nbetween Panama and the Orinoco valley.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the species was grown in Central America and\r\nYucatan at the time of the discovery of America. The seeds were sent\r\ninto the highlands of Mexico, and were even used as money, so highly\r\nwere they valued. The custom of drinking chocolate was general. The name\r\nof this excellent drink is Mexican. The Spaniards carried the cacao from\r\nAcapulco to the Philippine Isles in 1674 and 1680,[1571] where it\r\nsucceeded wonderfully. It is also cultivated in the Sunda Isles. I\r\nimagine it would succeed on the Guinea and Zanzibar coasts, but it is of\r\nno use to attempt to grow it in countries which are not very hot and\r\nvery damp.\r\n\r\nAnother species, _Theobroma bicolor_, Humboldt and Bonpland, is found\r\ngrowing with the common cacao in American plantations. It is not so much\r\nprized. On the other hand, it does not require so high a temperature,\r\nand can live at an altitude of nearly three thousand feet in the valley\r\nof the Magdalena. It abounds in a wild state in New Granada.[1572]\r\nBernoulli asserts that it is only cultivated in Guatemala, though the\r\ninhabitants call it mountain cacao.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Litchi+—_Nephelium Litchi_, Cambessides.\r\n\r\nThe seed of this species and of the two following is covered with a\r\nfleshy excrescence, very sweet and scented, which is eaten with tea.\r\n\r\nLike most of the _Sapindaceæ_, the nepheliums are trees. This one has\r\nbeen cultivated in the south of China, India, and the Malay Archipelago\r\nfrom a date of which we cannot be certain. Chinese authors living at\r\nPekin only knew the _Litchi_ late in the third century of our era.[1573]\r\nIts introduction into Bengal took place at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.[1574] Every one admits that the species is a native of the\r\nsouth of China, and, Blume[1575] adds, of Cochin-China and the\r\nPhilippine Isles, but it does not seem that any botanist has found it in\r\na truly wild state. This is probably because the southern part of China\r\ntowards Siam has been little visited. In Cochin-China and in Burmah and\r\nat Chittagong the _Litchi_ is only cultivated.[1576]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Longan+—_Nephelium longana_, Cambessides.\r\n\r\nThis second species, very often cultivated in Southern Asia, like the\r\n_Litchi_, is wild in British India, from Ceylon and Concan as far as the\r\nmountains to the east of Bengal, and in Pegu.[1577] The Chinese\r\nintroduced it into the Malay Archipelago some centuries ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Rambutan+—_Nephelium lappaceum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nIt is said to be wild in the Indian Archipelago, where it must have\r\nbeen long cultivated, to judge from the number of its varieties. A Malay\r\nname, given by Blume, signifies wild tree. Loureiro says it is wild in\r\nCochin-China and Java. Yet I find no confirmation for Cochin-China in\r\nmodern works, nor even for the islands. The new flora of British\r\nIndia[1578] indicates it at Singapore and Malacca without affirming that\r\nit is indigenous, on which head the labels in herbaria commonly tell us\r\nnothing. Certainly the species is not wild on the continent of Asia, in\r\nspite of the vague expressions of Blume and Miquel,[1579] but it is more\r\nprobably a native of the Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the reputation of the nepheliums, of which the fruit can be\r\nexported, it does not appear that these trees have been introduced into\r\nthe tropical colonies of Africa and America except into a few gardens as\r\ncuriosities.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Pistachio Nut+—_Pistacia vera_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe pistachio, a shrub belonging to the order _Anacardiaceæ_, grows\r\nnaturally in Syria. Boissier[1580] found it to the north of Damascus in\r\nAnti-Lebanon, and he saw specimens of it brought from Mesopotamia, but\r\nhe could not be sure that they were found wild. There is the same doubt\r\nabout branches gathered in Arabia, which have been mentioned by some\r\nwriters. Pliny and Galen[1581] knew that the species was a Syrian one.\r\nThe former tells us that the plant was introduced into Italy by\r\nVitellius at the end of the reign of Tiberius, and thence into Spain by\r\nFlavius Pompeius.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that the cultivation of the pistachio was\r\nancient even in its primitive country, but it is practised in our own\r\nday in the East, as well as in Sicily and Tunis. In the south of France\r\nand Spain it is of little importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Broad Bean+—_Faba vulgaris_, Mœnch; _Vicia faba_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nLinnæus, in his best descriptive work, _Hortus cliffortianus_, admits\r\nthat the origin of this species is obscure, like that of most plants of\r\nancient cultivation. Later, in his _Species_, which is more often\r\nquoted, he says, without giving any proof, that the bean “inhabits\r\nEgypt.” Lerche, a Russian traveller at the end of the last century,\r\nfound it wild in the Mungan desert of the Mazanderan, to the south of\r\nthe Caspian Sea.[1582] Travellers who have collected in this region have\r\nsometimes come across it,[1583] but they do not mention it in their\r\nwritings,[1584] excepting Ledebour,[1585] and the quotation on which he\r\nrelies is not correct. Bosc[1586] says that Olivier found the bean wild\r\nin Persia; I do not find this confirmed in Olivier’s _Voyage_, and as a\r\nrule Bosc seems to have been too ready to believe that Olivier found a\r\ngood many of our cultivated plants in the interior of Persia. He says it\r\nof buckwheat and of oats, which Olivier does not mention.\r\n\r\nThe only indication besides that of Lerche which I find in floras is a\r\nvery different locality. Munby mentions the bean as wild in Algeria, at\r\nOran. He adds that it is rare. No other author, to my knowledge, has\r\nspoken of it in northern Africa. Cosson, who knows the flora of Algeria\r\nbetter than any one, assures me he has not seen or received any specimen\r\nof the wild bean from the north of Africa. I have ascertained that there\r\nis no specimen in Munby’s[1587] herbarium, now at Kew. As the Arabs grow\r\nthe bean on a large scale, it may perhaps be met with accidentally\r\noutside cultivated plots. It must not be forgotten, however, that Pliny\r\n(lib. xviii. c. 12) speaks of a wild bean in Mauritania, but he adds\r\nthat it is hard and cannot be cooked, which throws doubt upon the\r\nspecies. Botanists who have written upon Egypt and Cyrenaica, especially\r\nthe more recent,[1588] give the bean as cultivated.\r\n\r\nThis plant alone constitutes the genus _Faba_. We cannot, therefore,\r\ncall in the aid of any botanical analogy to discover its origin. We must\r\nhave recourse to the history of its cultivation and to the names of the\r\nspecies to find out the country in which it was originally indigenous.\r\n\r\nWe must first eliminate an error which came from a wrong interpretation\r\nof Chinese works. Stanislas Julien believed that the bean was one of the\r\nfive plants which the Emperor Chin-nong commanded, 4600 years ago, to be\r\nsown every year with great solemnity.[1589] Now, according to Dr.\r\nBretschneider,[1590] who is surrounded at Pekin with every possible\r\nresource for arriving at the truth, the seed similar to a bean which the\r\nemperors sow in the enjoined ceremony is that of _Dolichos soja_, and\r\nthe bean was only introduced into China from Western Asia a century\r\nbefore the Christian era, at the time of Chang-kien’s embassy. Thus falls\r\nan assertion which it is hard to reconcile with other facts, for\r\ninstance with the absence of an ancient cultivation of the bean in\r\nIndia, and of a Sanskrit name, or even of any modern Indian name.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks were acquainted with the bean, which they called\r\n_kuamos_, and sometimes _kuamos ellenikos_, to distinguish it from that\r\nof Egypt, which was the seed of a totally different aquatic species,\r\n_Nelumbium_. The _Iliad_[1591] already mentions the bean as a cultivated\r\nplant, and Virchow found some beans in the excavations at Troy.[1592]\r\nThe Latins called it _faba_. We find nothing in the works of\r\nTheophrastus, Dioscorides, Pliny, etc., which leads us to believe the\r\nplant indigenous in Greece or Italy. It was early known, because it was\r\nan ancient Roman rite to put beans in the sacrifices to the goddess\r\nCarna, whence the name _Fabariæ Calendæ_.[1593] The Fabii perhaps took\r\ntheir name from _faba_, and the twelfth chapter of the eighteenth book\r\nof Pliny shows, without the possibility of a doubt, the antiquity and\r\nimportance of the bean in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe word _faba_ recurs in several of the Aryan languages of Europe, but\r\nwith modifications which philologists alone can recognize. We must not\r\nforget, however, Adolphe Pictet’s very just remark,[1594] that in the\r\ncases of the seeds of cereals and leguminous plants the names of one\r\nspecies are often transferred to another, or that certain names were\r\nsometimes specific and sometimes generic. Several seeds of like form\r\nwere called _kuamos_ by the Greeks; several different kinds of haricot\r\nbean (_Phaseolus_, _Dolichos_) bear the same name in Sanskrit, and\r\n_faba_ in ancient Slav, _bobu_ in ancient Prussian, _babo_ in Armorican,\r\n_fav_, etc., may very well have been used for peas, haricot beans, etc.\r\nIn our own day the phrase coffee-_bean_ is used in the trade. It has\r\nbeen rightly supposed that when Pliny speaks of _fabariæ_ islands, where\r\nbeans were found in abundance, he alludes to a species of wild pea\r\ncalled botanically _Pisum maritimum_.\r\n\r\nThe ancient inhabitants of Switzerland and of Italy in the age of bronze\r\ncultivated a small-fruited variety of _Faba vulgaris_.[1595] Heer calls\r\nit _Celtica nana_, because it is only six to nine millimetres long,\r\nwhereas our modern field bean is ten to twelve millimetres. He has\r\ncompared the specimens from Montelier on Lake Morat, and St. Peter’s\r\nIslands on Lake Bienne, with others of the same epoch from Parma.\r\nMortellet found, in the contemporary lake-dwellings on the Lake Bourget,\r\nthe same small bean, which is, he says, very like a variety cultivated\r\nin Spain at the present day.[1596]\r\n\r\nThe bean was cultivated by the ancient Egyptians.[1597] It is true that\r\nhitherto no beans have been found in the sarcophagi, or drawings of the\r\nplant seen on the monuments. The reason is said to be that the plant was\r\nreckoned unclean.[1598] Herodotus[1599] says, “The Egyptians never sow\r\nthe bean in their land, and if it grows they do not eat it either cooked\r\nor raw. The priests cannot even endure the sight of it; they imagine\r\nthat this vegetable is unclean.” The bean existed then in Egypt, and\r\nprobably in cultivated places, for the soil which would suit it was as a\r\nrule under cultivation. Perhaps the poor population and that of certain\r\ndistricts did not share the prejudices of the priests; we know that the\r\nsuperstitions varied with the _nomes_. Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus\r\nmention the cultivation of the bean in Egypt, but they wrote five\r\nhundred years later than Herodotus.\r\n\r\nThe word _pol_ occurs twice in the Old Testament;[1600] it has been\r\ntranslated bean because of the traditions preserved by the Talmud, and\r\nof the Arabic name _foul_, _fol_, or _ful_, which is that of the bean.\r\nThe first of the two verses shows that the Hebrews were acquainted with\r\nthe bean one thousand years before Christ.\r\n\r\nLastly, I shall mention a sign of the ancient existence of the bean in\r\nthe north of Africa. This is the Berber name _ibiou_, in the plural\r\n_iabouen_, used by the Kabyles of the province of Algiers.[1601] It has\r\nno resemblance to the Semitic name, and dates perhaps from a remote\r\nantiquity. The Berbers formerly inhabited Mauritania, where Pliny\r\nasserts that the species was wild. It is not known whether the Guanchos\r\n(the Berber people of the Canaries) knew the bean. I doubt whether the\r\nIberians had it, for their supposed descendants, the Basques, use the\r\nname _baba_,[1602] answering to the Roman _faba_.\r\n\r\nWe judge from these facts that the bean was cultivated in Europe in\r\nprehistoric terms. It was introduced into Europe probably by the western\r\nAryans at the time of their earliest migrations (Pelasgians, Kelts,\r\nSlavs). It was taken to China later, a century before the Christian era,\r\nand still later into Japan, and quite recently into India.\r\n\r\nIts wild habitat was probably twofold some thousands of years ago, one\r\nof the centres being to the south of the Caspian, the other in the north\r\nof Africa. This kind of area, which I have called disjunctive, and to\r\nwhich I formerly paid a good deal of attention,[1603] is rare in\r\ndicotyledons, but there are examples in those very countries of which I\r\nhave just spoken.[1604] It is probable that the area of the bean has\r\nlong been in process of diminution and of extinction. The nature of the\r\nplant is in favour of this hypothesis, for its seed has no means of\r\ndispersing itself, and rodents or other animals can easily make prey of\r\nit. Its area in Western Asia was probably less limited at one time, and\r\nthat in Africa in Pliny’s day was more or less extensive. The struggle\r\nfor existence which was going against this plant, as against maize,\r\nwould have gradually isolated it and caused it to disappear, if man had\r\nnot saved it by cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe plant which most nearly resembles the bean is _Vicia narbonensis_.\r\nAuthors who do not admit the genus _Faba_, of which the characters are\r\nnot very distinct from those of _Vicia_, place these two species in the\r\nsame section. Now, _Vicia narbonensis_ is wild in the Mediterranean\r\nbasin and in the East as far as the Caucasus, in the north of Persia,\r\nand in Mesopotamia.[1605] Its area is continuous, but this renders the\r\nhypothesis I mentioned above probable by analogy.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Lentil+—_Ervum lens_, Linnæus; _Lens esculenta_, Mœnch.\r\n\r\nThe plants which most nearly resemble the lentil are classed by authors\r\nnow in the genus _Ervum_, now in a distinct genus _Lens_, and sometimes\r\nin the genus _Cicer_; but the species of these ill-defined groups all\r\nbelong to the Mediterranean basin or to Western Asia. This throws some\r\nlight on the origin of the cultivated plant. Unfortunately, the lentil\r\nis no longer to be found in a wild state, at least with certainty. The\r\nfloras of the south of Europe, of Northern Africa, of the East, and of\r\nIndia always mention it as cultivated, or as growing in fields after or\r\nwith other cultivated species. A botanist[1606] saw it in the provinces\r\nto the south of the Caucasus, “cultivated and nearly wild here and there\r\nround villages.” Another[1607] indicates it vaguely in the south of\r\nRussia, but more recent floras fail to confirm this.\r\n\r\nThe history and names of this plant may give clearer indications of its\r\norigin. It has been cultivated in the East, in the Mediterranean basin\r\nand even in Switzerland, from prehistoric time. According to Herodotos,\r\nTheophrastus, etc., the ancient Egyptians used it largely. If their\r\nmonuments give no proof of this, it was probably because the lentil was,\r\nlike the bean, considered common and coarse. The Old Testament mentions\r\nit three times, by the name _adaschum_ or _adaschim_, which must\r\ncertainly mean lentil, for the Arabic name is _ads_,[1608] or\r\n_adas_.[1609] The _red_ colour of Esau’s famous mess of pottage has not\r\nbeen understood by most authors. Reynier,[1610] who had lived in Egypt,\r\nconfirms the explanation given formerly by Josephus; the lentils were\r\nred because they were hulled. It is still the practice in Egypt, says\r\nReynier, to remove the husk or outer skin from the lentil, and in this\r\ncase they are a pale red. The Berbers have the Semitic name _adès_ for\r\nthe lentil.[1611]\r\n\r\nThe Greeks cultivated the species—_fakos_ or _fakai_. Aristophanes\r\nmentions it as an article of food of the poor.[1612] The Latins called\r\nit _lens_, a name whose origin is unknown, which is evidently allied to\r\nthe ancient Slav _lesha_, Illyrian _lechja_, Lithuanian\r\n_lenszic_.[1613] The difference between the Greek and Latin names shows\r\nthat the species perhaps existed in Greece and Italy before it was\r\ncultivated. Another proof of ancient existence in Europe is the\r\ndiscovery of lentils in the lake-dwellings of St. Peter’s Island, Lake\r\nof Bienne,[1614] which are of the age of bronze. The species may have\r\nbeen introduced from Italy.\r\n\r\nAccording to Theophrastus,[1615] the inhabitants of Bactriana (the\r\nmodern Bokkara) did not know the _fakos_ of the Greeks. Adolphe Pictet\r\nquotes a Persian name, _mangu_ or _margu_, but he does not say whether\r\nit is an ancient name, existing, for instance, in the Zend Avesta. He\r\nadmits several Sanskrit names for the lentil, _masura_, _renuka_,\r\n_mangalya_, etc., while Anglo-Indian botanists, Roxburgh and Piddington,\r\nknew none.[1616] As these authors mention an analogous name in\r\nHindustani and Bengali, _mussour_, we may suppose that _masura_\r\nsignifies lentil, while _mangu_ in Persian recalls the other name\r\n_mangalya_. As Roxburgh and Piddington give no name in other Indian\r\nlanguages, it may be supposed that the lentil was not known in this\r\ncountry before the invasion of the Sanskrit-speaking race. Ancient\r\nChinese works do not mention the species; at least, Dr. Bretschneider\r\nsays nothing of them in his work published in 1870, nor in the more\r\ndetailed letters which he has since written to me.\r\n\r\nThe lentil appears to have existed in western temperate Asia, in Greece,\r\nand in Italy, where its cultivation was first undertaken in very early\r\nprehistoric time, when it was introduced into Egypt. Its cultivation\r\nappears to have been extended at a less remote epoch, but still hardly\r\nin historic time, both east and west, that is into Europe and India.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Chick-Pea+—_Cicer arietinum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nFifteen species of the genus _Cicer_ are known, all of Western Asia or\r\nGreece, except one, which is Abyssinian. It seems, therefore, most\r\nprobable that the cultivated species comes from the tract of land lying\r\nbetween Greece and the Himalayas, vaguely termed the East. The species\r\nhas not been found undoubtedly wild. All the floras of the south of\r\nEurope, of Egypt, and of Western Asia as far as the Caucasus and India,\r\ngive it as a cultivated species, or growing in fields and cultivated\r\ngrounds. It has sometimes[1617] been indicated in the Crimea, and to the\r\nnorth, and especially to the south of the Caucasus, as nearly wild; but\r\nwell-informed modern authors do not think so.[1618] This quasi-wildness\r\ncan only point to its origin in Armenia and the neighbouring countries.\r\nThe cultivation and the names of the species may perhaps throw some\r\nlight on the question.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks cultivated this species of pea as early as Homer’s time,\r\nunder the name of _erebinthos_,[1619] and also of _krios_,[1620] from\r\nthe resemblance of the pea to the head of a ram. The Latins called it\r\n_cicer_, which is the origin of all the modern names in the south of\r\nEurope. The name exists also among the Albanians, descendants of the\r\nPelasgians, under the form _kikere_.[1621] The existence of such widely\r\ndifferent names shows that the plant was very early known, and perhaps\r\nindigenous, in the south-east of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe chick-pea has not been found in the lake-dwellings of Switzerland,\r\nSavoy, and Italy. In the first-named locality its absence is not\r\nsingular; the climate is not hot enough. A common name among the peoples\r\nof the south of the Caucasus and of the Caspian Sea is, in Georgian,\r\n_nachuda_; in Turkish and Armenian, _nachius_, _nachunt_; in Persian,\r\n_nochot_.[1622] Philologists can tell if this is a very ancient name,\r\nand if it has any connection with the Sanskrit _chennuka_.\r\n\r\nThe chick-pea is so frequently cultivated in Egypt from the earliest\r\ntimes of the Christian era,[1623] that it is supposed to have been also\r\nknown to the ancient Egyptians. There is no proof to be found in the\r\ndrawings or stores of grain in their monuments, but it may be supposed\r\nthat this pea, like the bean and the lentil, was considered common or\r\nunclean. Reynier[1624] thought that the _ketsech_, mentioned by Isaiah\r\nin the Old Testament, was perhaps the chick-pea; but this name is\r\ngenerally attributed, though without certainty, to _Nigella sativa_ or\r\n_Vicia sativa_.[1625] As the Arabs have a totally different name for the\r\nchick-pea, _omnos, homos_, which recurs in the Kabyl language as\r\n_hammez_,[1626] it is not likely that the _ketsech_ of the Jews was the\r\nsame plant. These details lead me to suspect that the species was\r\nunknown to the ancient Egyptians and to the Hebrews. It was perhaps\r\nintroduced among them from Greece or Italy towards the beginning of our\r\nera.\r\n\r\nIt is of more ancient introduction into India, for there is a Sanskrit\r\nname, and several others, analogous or different, in modern Indian\r\nlanguages.[1627] Bretschneider does not mention the species in China.\r\n\r\nI do not know of any proof of antiquity of culture in Spain, yet the\r\nCastilian name _garbanzo_, used also by the Basques under the form\r\n_garbantzua_, and by the French as _garvance_, being neither Latin nor\r\nArabic, may date from an epoch anterior to the Roman conquest.\r\n\r\nBotanical, historical, and philological data agree in indicating a\r\nhabitation anterior to cultivation in the countries to the south of the\r\nCaucasus and to the north of Persia. The western Aryans (Pelasgians,\r\nHellenes) perhaps introduced the plant into Southern Europe, where,\r\nhowever, there is some probability that it was also indigenous. The\r\nwestern Aryans carried it into India. Its area perhaps extended from\r\nPersia to Greece, and the species now exists only in cultivated ground,\r\nwhere we do not know whether it springs from a stock originally wild or\r\nfrom cultivated plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Lupin+—_Lupinus albus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans cultivated this leguminous plant to bury\r\nit as a green manure, and also for the sake of the seeds, which are a\r\ngood fodder for cattle, and which are also used by man. The expressions\r\nof Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Cato, Varro, Pliny, etc., quoted by modern\r\nwriters, refer to the culture or to the medical properties of the seeds,\r\nand do not show whether the species was the white lupin, _L. albus_, or\r\nthe blue-flowered lupin, _L. hirsutus_, which grows wild in the south of\r\nEurope. Fraas says[1628] that the latter is grown in the Morea at the\r\npresent day; but Heldreich says[1629] that _L. albus_ grows in Attica.\r\nAs this is the species which has been long cultivated in Italy, it is\r\nprobable that it is the lupin of the ancients. It was much grown in the\r\neighteenth century, especially in Italy,[1630] and de l’Ecluse settles\r\nthe question of the species, as he calls it _Lupinus sativus albo\r\nflore_.[1631] The antiquity of its cultivation in Spain is shown by the\r\nexistence of four different common names, according to the province; but\r\nthe plant is only found cultivated or nearly wild in fields and sandy\r\nplaces.[1632] The species is indicated by Bertoloni in Italy, on the\r\nhills of Sarzana. Yet Caruel does not believe it to be wild here, any\r\nmore than in other parts of the peninsula.[1633] Gussone[1634] is very\r\npositive for Sicily—“on barren and sandy hills, and in meadows (_in\r\nherbidis_)” Lastly, Grisebach[1635] found it in Turkey in Europe, near\r\nRuskoï, and d’Urville[1636] saw it in abundance, in a wood near\r\nConstantinople. Castagne confirms this in a manuscript catalogue in my\r\npossession. Boissier does not mention any locality in the East; the\r\nspecies does not exist in India, but Russian botanists have found it to\r\nthe south of the Caucasus, though we do not know with certainty if it\r\nwas really wild.[1637] Other localities will perhaps be found between\r\nSicily, Macedonia, and the Caucasus.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Egyptian Lupin+—_Lupinus termis_, Forskal.\r\n\r\nThis species of lupin, so nearly allied to _L. albus_ that it has\r\nsometimes been proposed to unite them,[1638] is largely cultivated in\r\nEgypt and even in Crete. The most obvious difference is that the upper\r\npart of the flowers of _L. termis_ is blue. The stem is taller than that\r\nof _L. albus._ The seeds are used like those of the common lupin, after\r\nthey have been steeped to get rid of their bitterness.\r\n\r\n_L. termis_ is wild in sandy soil and mountainous districts, in Sicily,\r\nSardinia, and Corsica;[1639] in Syria and Egypt, according to\r\nBoissier;[1640] but Schweinfurth and Ascherson[1641] say that it is only\r\ncultivated in Egypt. Hartmann saw it wild in Upper Egypt.[1642]\r\nUnger[1643] mentions it among the cultivated specimens of the ancient\r\nEgyptians, but he gives neither specimen nor drawing. Wilkinson[1644]\r\nsays only that it has been found in the tombs.\r\n\r\nNo lupin is grown in India, nor is there any Sanskrit name; its seeds\r\nare sold in bazaars under the name _tourmus_ (Royle, _Ill._, p. 194).\r\n\r\nThe Arabic name, _termis_ or _termus_, is also that of the Greek lupin,\r\n_termos_. It may be inferred that the Greeks had it from the Egyptians.\r\nAs the species was known to the ancient Egyptians, it seems strange that\r\nit has no Hebrew name;[1645] but it may have been introduced into Egypt\r\nafter the departure of the Israelites.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Field-Pea+—_Pisum arvense_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis pea is grown on a large scale for the seed, and also sometimes for\r\nfodder. Although its appearance and botanical characters allow of its\r\nbeing easily distinguished from the garden-pea, Greek and Roman authors\r\nconfounded them, or are not explicit about them. Their writings do not\r\nprove that it was cultivated in their time. It has not been found in the\r\nlake-dwellings of Switzerland, France, and Italy. Bobbio has a legend\r\n(A.D. 930), in which it is said that the Italian peasants called a\r\ncertain seed _herbilia_, whence it has been supposed to be the modern\r\n_rubiglia_ or the _Pisum sativum_ of botanists.[1646] The species is\r\ncultivated in the East, and as far as the north of India.[1647] It is of\r\nrecent cultivation in the latter country, for there is no Sanskrit name,\r\nand Piddington gives only one name in one of the modern languages.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the date of the introduction of its culture, the species\r\nis undoubtedly wild in Italy, not only in hedges and near cultivated\r\nground, but also in forests and wild mountainous districts.[1648] I find\r\nno positive indication in the floras that it grows in like manner in\r\nSpain, Algeria, Greece, and the East. The plant is said to be indigenous\r\nin the south of Russia, but sometimes its wild character is doubtful,\r\nand sometimes the species itself is not certain, from a confusion with\r\n_Pisum sativum_ and _P. elatius_. Of all Anglo-Indian botanists, only\r\nRoyle admits it to be indigenous in the north of India.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Garden-Pea+—_Pisum sativum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe pea of our kitchen gardens is more delicate than the field-pea, and\r\nsuffers from frost and drought. Its natural area, previous to\r\ncultivation, was probably more to the south and more restricted. It has\r\nnot hitherto been found wild, either in Europe or in the west of Asia,\r\nwhence it is supposed to have come. Bieberstein’s indication of the\r\nspecies in the Crimea is not correct, according to Steven, who was a\r\nresident in the country.[1649] Perhaps botanists have overlooked its\r\nhabitation; perhaps the plant has disappeared from its original\r\ndwelling; perhaps also it is a mere modification, effected by culture,\r\nof _Pisum arvense_. Alefeld held the latter opinion,[1650] but he has\r\npublished too little on the subject for us to be able to conclude\r\nanything from it. He only says that, having cultivated a great number of\r\nvarieties both of the field and garden pea, he concludes that they\r\nbelong to the same species. Darwin[1651] learnt through a third person\r\nthat Andrew Knight had crossed the field-pea with a garden variety known\r\nas the Prussian pea, and that the product was fertile. This would\r\ncertainly be a proof of specific unity, but further observation and\r\nexperiment is required. In the mean time, in the search for geographic\r\norigin, etc., I am obliged to consider the two forms separately.\r\n\r\nBotanists who distinguish many species in the genus Pisum, admit eight,\r\nall European or Asiatic. _Pisum sativum_ was cultivated by the Greeks in\r\nthe time of Theophrastus.[1652] They called it _pisos_, or _pison_. The\r\nAlbanians, descendants of the Pelasgians, call it _pizelle_.[1653] The\r\nLatins had _pisum_.[1654] This uniformity of nomenclature seems to show\r\nthat the Aryans knew the plant when they arrived in Greece and Italy,\r\nand perhaps brought it with them. Other Aryan languages have several\r\nnames for the generic sense of _pea_; but it is evident, from Adolphe\r\nPictet’s learned discussion on the subject,[1655] that none of these\r\nnames can be applied to _Pisum sativum_ in particular. Even when one of\r\nthe modern languages, Slav or Breton, limits the sense to the\r\ngarden-pea, it is very probable that formerly the word signified\r\nfield-pea, lentil, or any other leguminous plant.\r\n\r\nThe garden-pea[1656] has been found among the remains in the\r\nlake-dwellings of the age of bronze, in Switzerland and Savoy. The seed\r\nis spherical, wherein it differs from _Pisum arvense_. It is smaller\r\nthan our modern pea. Heer says he found it also among relics of the\r\nstone age, at Moosseedorf; but he is less positive, and only gives\r\nfigures of the less ancient pea of St. Peter’s Island. If the species\r\ndates from the stone age in Switzerland, it would be anterior to the\r\nimmigration of the Aryans.\r\n\r\nThere is no indication of the culture of _Pisum sativum_ in ancient\r\nEgypt or in India. On the other hand, it has long been cultivated in the\r\nnorth of India, if it had, as Piddington says, a Sanskrit name,\r\n_harenso_, and if it has several names very different to this in modern\r\nIndian languages.[1657] It has been introduced into China from Western\r\nAsia. The _Pent-sao_, drawn up at the end of the sixteenth century,\r\ncalls it the Mahometan pea.[1658] In conclusion: the species seems to\r\nhave existed in Western Asia, perhaps from the south of the Caucasus to\r\nPersia, before it was cultivated. The Aryans introduced it into Europe,\r\nbut it perhaps existed in Northern India before the arrival of the\r\neastern Aryans. It no longer exists in a wild state, and when it occurs\r\nin fields, half-wild, it is not said to have a modified form so as to\r\napproach some other species.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Soy+—_Dolichos soja_, Linnæus; _Glycine soja_, Bentham.\r\n\r\nThis leguminous annual has been cultivated in China and Japan from\r\nremote antiquity. This might be gathered from the many uses of the soy\r\nbean and from the immense number of varieties. But it is also supposed\r\nto be one of the farinaceous substances called _shu_ in Chinese writings\r\nof Confucius’ time, though the modern name of the plant is\r\n_ta-tou_.[1659] The bean is nourishing, and contains a large proportion\r\nof oil, and preparations similar to butter, oil, and cheese are\r\nextracted from it and used in Chinese and Japanese cooking.[1660] Soy is\r\nalso grown in the Malay Archipelago, but at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury it was still rare in Amboyna,[1661] and Forster did not see it\r\nin the Pacific Isles at the time of Cook’s voyages. It is of modern\r\nintroduction in India, for Roxburgh had only seen the plant in the\r\nbotanical gardens at Calcutta, where it was brought from the\r\nMoluccas.[1662] There are no common Indian names.[1663] Besides, if its\r\ncultivation had been ancient in India, it would have spread westward\r\ninto Syria and Egypt, which is not the case.\r\n\r\nKæmpfer[1664] formerly published an excellent illustration of the soy\r\nbean, and it had existed for a century in European botanical gardens,\r\nwhen more extensive information about China and Japan excited about ten\r\nyears ago a lively desire to introduce it into our countries. In\r\nAustria, Hungary, and France especially, attempts have been made on a\r\nlarge scale, of which the results have been summed up in works worthy of\r\nconsultation.[1665] It is to be hoped these efforts may be successful;\r\nbut we must not digress from the aim of our researches, the probable\r\norigin of the species.\r\n\r\nLinnæus says, in his _Species_, “habitat in India,” and refers to\r\nKæmpfer, who speaks of the plant in Japan, and to his own flora of\r\nCeylon, where he gives the plant as _cultivated_. Thwaites’s modern\r\nflora of Ceylon makes no mention of it. We must evidently go further\r\neast to find the origin both of the species and of its cultivation.\r\nLoureiro says that it grows in Cochin-China and that it is often\r\ncultivated in China.[1666] I find no proof that it is wild in the latter\r\ncountry, but it may perhaps be discovered, as its culture is so ancient.\r\nRussian botanists[1667] have only found it cultivated in the north of\r\nChina and in the basin of the river Amur. It is certainly wild in\r\nJapan.[1668] Junghuhn[1669] found it in Java on Mount Gunung-Gamping,\r\nand a plant sent also from Java by Zollinger is supposed to belong to\r\nthis species, but it is not certain that the specimen was wild.[1670] A\r\nMalay name, _kadelee_,[1671] a quite different to the Japanese and\r\nChinese common names, is in favour of its indigenous character in Java.\r\n\r\nKnown facts and historical and philological probabilities tend to show\r\nthat the species was wild from Cochin-China to the south of Japan and to\r\nJava when the ancient inhabitants of this region began to cultivate it\r\nat a very remote period, to use it for food in various ways, and to\r\nobtain from it varieties of which the number is remarkable, especially\r\nin Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Pigeon-Pea+—_Cajanus indicus_, Sprengel; _Cytisus Cajan_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis leguminous plant, often grown in tropical countries, is a shrub,\r\nbut it fruits in the first year, and in some countries it is grown as an\r\nannual. Its seed is an important article of the food of the negroes and\r\nnatives, but the European colonists do not care for it unless cooked\r\ngreen like our garden-pea. The plant is easily naturalized in poor soil\r\nround cultivated plots, even in the West India Islands, where it is not\r\nindigenous.[1672]\r\n\r\nIn Mauritius it is called _ambrevade_; in the English colonies, _doll_,\r\n_pigeon-pea_; and in the French Antilles, _pois d’Angola_, _pois de\r\nCongo_, _pois pigeon_.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that, though the species is diffused in three\r\ncontinents, the varieties are not numerous. Two are cited, based only\r\nupon the yellow or reddish colour of the flower, which were formerly\r\nregarded as distinct species; but a more attentive examination has\r\nresulted in their being classed as one, in accordance with Linnæus’\r\nopinion.[1673] The small number of variations obtained even in the organ\r\nfor which the species is cultivated is a sign of no very ancient\r\nculture. Its habitation previous to culture is uncertain. The best\r\nbotanists have sometimes supposed it to be a native of India, sometimes\r\nof tropical Africa. Bentham, who has made a careful study of the\r\nleguminous plants, believed in 1861 in the African origin; in 1865 he\r\ninclined rather to Asia.[1674] The problem is, therefore, an interesting\r\none. There is no question of an American origin. The cajan was\r\nintroduced into the West Indies from the coast of Africa by the slave\r\ntrade, as the common names quoted above show,[1675] and the unanimous\r\nopinion of authors or American floras. It has also been taken to Brazil,\r\nGuiana, and into all the warm parts of the American continent.\r\n\r\nThe facility with which the species is naturalized would alone prevent\r\nattaching great importance to the statements of collectors, who have\r\nfound it more or less wild in Asia or in Africa; and besides, these\r\nassertions are not precise, but are usually doubtful. Most writers on\r\nthe flora of continental India have only seen the plant\r\ncultivated,[1676] and none, to my knowledge, affirms that it exists\r\nwild. For the island of Ceylon Thwaites says,[1677] “It is said not to\r\nbe really wild, and the country names seem to confirm this.” Sir Joseph\r\nHooker, in his _Flora of British India_, says, “Wild (?) and cultivated\r\nto the height of six thousand feet in the Himalayas.” Loureiro[1678]\r\ngives it as cultivated and non-cultivated in China and Cochin-China.\r\nChinese authors do not appear to have spoken of it, for the species is\r\nnot named by Bretschneider in his work _On the Study_, etc. In the Sunda\r\nIsles it is mentioned as cultivated, and that rarely, at Amboyna at the\r\nend of the eighteenth century, according to Rumphius.[1679] Forster had\r\nnot seen it in the Pacific Isles at the time of Cook’s voyages, but\r\nSeemann says that it has been recently introduced by missionaries into\r\nthe Fiji Isles.[1680] All this argues no very ancient extension of\r\ncultivation to the east and south of the continent of Asia. Besides the\r\nquotation from Loureiro, I find the species indicated on the mountain of\r\nMagelang, Java;[1681] but, supposing this to be a true and ancient wild\r\ngrowth in both cases, it would be very extraordinary not to find the\r\nspecies in many other Asiatic localities.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of Indian and Malay names[1682] shows a somewhat ancient\r\ncultivation. Piddington even gives a Sanskrit name, _arhuku_, which was\r\nnot known to Roxburgh, but he gives no proof in support of his\r\nassertion. The name may have been merely supposed from the Hindu and\r\nBengali names _urur_ and _orol_. No Semitic name is known.\r\n\r\nIn Africa the cajan is often found from Zanzibar to the coast of\r\nGuinea.[1683] Authors say it is cultivated, or else make no statement on\r\nthis head, which would seem to show that the specimens are sometimes\r\nwild. In Egypt this cultivation is quite modern, of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.[1684]\r\n\r\nBriefly, then, I doubt that the species is really wild in Asia, and that\r\nit has been grown there for more than three thousand years. If more\r\nancient peoples had known it, it would have come to the knowledge of the\r\nArabs and Egyptians before our time. In tropical Africa, on the\r\ncontrary, it is possible that it has existed wild or cultivated for a\r\nvery long time, and that it was introduced into Asia by ancient\r\ntravellers trading between Zanzibar and India or Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe genus Cajanus has only one species, so that no analogy of\r\ngeographical distribution leads us to believe it to be rather of\r\nAsiatic than African origin, or _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Carob Tree+[1685]—_Ceratonia siliqua_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe seeds and pods of the carob are highly prized in the hotter parts of\r\nthe Mediterranean basin, as food for animals and even for man. De\r\nGasparin[1686] has given interesting details about the raising, uses,\r\nand habitation of the species as a cultivated tree. He notes that it\r\ndoes not pass the northern limit beyond which the orange cannot be grown\r\nwithout shelter. This fine evergreen tree does not thrive either in very\r\nhot countries, especially where there is much humidity. It likes the\r\nneighbourhood of the sea and rocky places. Its original country,\r\naccording to Gasparin, is “probably the centre of Africa. Denham and\r\nClapperton found it in Burnou.” This proof seems to me insufficient, for\r\nin all the Nile Valley and in Abyssinia the carob is not wild nor even\r\ncultivated.[1687] R. Brown does not mention it in his account of Denham\r\nand Clapperton’s journey. Travellers have seen it in the forests of\r\nCyrenaica between the highlands and the littoral; but the able\r\nbotanists who have drawn up the catalogue of the plants of this country\r\nare careful to say,[1688] “perhaps indigenous.” Most botanists merely\r\nmention the species in the centre and south of the Mediterranean basin,\r\nfrom Spain and Marocco to Syria and Anatolia, without inquiring closely\r\nwhether it is indigenous or cultivated, and without entering upon the\r\nquestion of its true country previous to cultivation. Usually they\r\nindicate the carob tree, as “cultivated and subspontaneous, or nearly\r\nwild.” However, it is stated to be wild in Greece by Heldreich, in\r\nSicily by Gussone and Bianca, in Algeria by Munby;[1689] and these\r\nauthors have each lived long enough in the country for which each is\r\nquoted to form an enlightened opinion.\r\n\r\nBianca remarks, however, that the carob tree is not always healthy and\r\nproductive in those restricted localities where it exists in Sicily, in\r\nthe small adjacent islands, and on the coast of Italy. He puts forward\r\nthe opinion, moreover, based upon the similarity of the Italian name\r\n_carrubo_ with the Arabic word, that the species was anciently\r\nintroduced into the south of Europe, the species being of Syrian or\r\nnorth African origin. He maintains as probable the theory of Hœfer and\r\nBonné,[1690] that the lotus of the lotophagi was the carob tree, of\r\nwhich the flower is sweet and the fruit has a taste of honey, which\r\nagrees with the expressions of Homer. The lotus-eaters dwelt in\r\nCyrenaica, so that the carob must have been abundant in their country.\r\nIf we admit this hypothesis we must suppose that Pliny and Herodotus did\r\nnot know Homer’s plant, for the one describes the lotus as bearing a\r\nfruit like a mastic berry (_Pistacia lentiscus_), the other as a\r\ndeciduous tree.[1691]\r\n\r\nAn hypothesis regarding a doubtful plant formerly mentioned by a poet\r\ncan hardly serve as the basis of an argument upon facts of natural\r\nhistory. After all, Homer’s lotus plant perhaps existed only in the\r\nfabled garden of Hesperides. I return to more serious arguments, on\r\nwhich Bianca has said a few words.\r\n\r\nThe carob has two names in ancient languages—the one Greek, _keraunia_\r\nor _kerateia_;[1692] the other Arabic, _chirnub_ or _charûb_. The first\r\nalludes to the form of the pod, which is like a slightly curved horn;\r\nthe other means merely pod, for we find in Ebn Baithar’s[1693] work that\r\nfour other leguminous plants bear the same name, with a qualifying\r\nepithet. The Latins had no special name; they used the Greek word, or\r\nthe expression _siliqua_, _siliqua græca_ (Greek pod).[1694] This dearth\r\nof names is the sign of a once restricted area, and of a culture which\r\nprobably does not date from prehistoric time. The Greek name is still\r\nretained in Greece. The Arab name persists among the Kabyles, who call\r\nthe fruit _kharroub_, the tree _takharrout_,[1695] and the Spaniards\r\n_algarrobo_. Curiously enough, the Italians also took the Arab name\r\n_currabo_, _carubio_, whence the French _caroubier_. It seems that it\r\nmust have been introduced after the Roman epoch by the Arabs of the\r\nMiddle Ages, when there was another name for it. These details are all\r\nin favour of Bianca’s theory of a more southern origin than Sicily.\r\nPliny says the species belonged to Syria, Ionia, Cnidos, and Rhodes, but\r\nhe does not say whether it was wild or cultivated in these places. Pliny\r\nalso says that the carob tree did not exist in Egypt. Yet it has been\r\nrecognized in monuments belonging to a much earlier epoch than that of\r\nPliny, and Egyptologists even attribute two Egyptian names to it,\r\n_kontrates_ or _jiri_.[1696] Lepsius gives a drawing of a pod which\r\nappears to him to be certainly a carob, and the botanist Kotschy made\r\ncertain by microscopic investigation that a stick taken from a\r\nsarcophagus was made from the wood of the carob tree.[1697] There is no\r\nknown Hebrew name for the species, which is not mentioned in the Old\r\nTestament. The New Testament speaks of it by the Greek name in the\r\nparable of the prodigal son. It is a tradition of the Christians in the\r\nEast that St. John Baptist fed upon the fruit of the carob in the\r\ndesert, and hence came the names given to it in the Middle Ages—_bread\r\nof St. John_, and _Johannis brodbaum_.\r\n\r\nEvidently this tree became important at the beginning of the Christian\r\nera, and it spread, especially through the agency of the Arabs, towards\r\nthe West. If it had previously existed in Algeria, among the Berbers,\r\nand in Spain, older names would have persisted, and the species would\r\nprobably have been introduced into the Canaries by the Phœnicians.\r\n\r\nThe information gained on the subject may be summed up as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe carob grew wild in the Levant, probably on the southern coast of\r\nAnatolia and in Syria, perhaps also in Cyrenaica. Its cultivation began\r\nwithin historic time. The Greeks diffused it in Greece and Italy; but it\r\nwas afterwards more highly esteemed by the Arabs, who propagated it as\r\nfar as Marocco and Spain. In all these countries the tree has become\r\nnaturalized here and there in a less productive form, which it is\r\nneedful to graft to obtain good fruit.\r\n\r\nThe carob has not been found in the tufa and quaternary deposits of\r\nSouthern Europe. It is the only one of its kind in the genus\r\n_Ceratonia_, which is somewhat exceptional among the _Leguminosæ_,\r\nespecially in Europe. Nothing shows that it existed in the ancient\r\ntertiary or quaternary flora of the south-west of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Common Haricot Kidney Bean+—_Phaseolus vulgaris_, Savi.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1855, I wished to investigate the origin of the genera\r\n_Phaseolus_ and _Dolichos_,[1698] the distinction of species was so\r\nlittle defined, and the floras of tropical countries so rare, that I was\r\nobliged to leave several questions on one side. Now, thanks to the works\r\nof Bentham and Georg von Martens,[1699] completing the previous labours\r\nof Savi,[1700] the _Leguminæ_ of hot countries are better known; lastly,\r\nthe seeds discovered quite recently in the Peruvian tombs of Ancon,\r\nexamined by Wittmack, have completely modified the question of origin.\r\n\r\nI will speak first of the common haricot bean, afterwards of some other\r\nspecies, without, however, enumerating all those which are cultivated,\r\nfor several of these are still ill defined.\r\n\r\nBotanists held for a long time that the common haricot was of Indian\r\norigin. No one had found it wild, nor has it yet been found, but it was\r\nsupposed to be of Indian origin, although the species was also\r\ncultivated in Africa and America, in temperate and hot regions, at least\r\nin those where the heat and humidity are not excessive. I called\r\nattention to the fact that there is no Sanskrit name, and that\r\nsixteenth-century gardeners often called the species _Turkish bean_.\r\nConvinced, moreover, that the Greeks cultivated this plant under the\r\nnames _fasiolos_ and _dolichos_, I suggested that it came originally\r\nfrom Western Asia, and not from India. Georg von Martens adopted this\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nHowever, the meaning of the words _dolichos_ of Theophrastus, _fasiolos_\r\nof Dioscorides, _faseolus_ and _phaseolus_ of the Romans,[1701] is far\r\nfrom being sufficiently defined to allow them to be attributed with\r\ncertainty to _Phaseolus vulgaris_. Several cultivated _Leguminosæ_ are\r\nsupported by the trellises mentioned by authors, and have pods and seeds\r\nof a similar kind. The best argument for translating these names by\r\n_Phaseolus vulgaris_ is that the modern Greeks and Italians have names\r\nderived from _fasiolus_ for the common haricot. In modern Greek it is\r\n_fasoulia_, Albanian (Pelasgic?) _fasulé_, in Italian _fagiolo_. It is\r\npossible, however, that the name has been transferred from a species of\r\npea or vetch, or from a haricot formerly cultivated, to our modern\r\nharicot. It is rather bold to determine a species of _Phaseolus_ from\r\none or two epithets in an ancient author, when we see how difficult is\r\nthe distinction of species to modern botanists with the plants under\r\ntheir eyes. Nevertheless, the _dolichos_ of Theophrastus has been\r\ndefinitely referred to the _scarlet runner_, and the _fasiolos_ to the\r\ndwarf haricot of our gardens, which are the two principal modern\r\nvarieties of the common haricot, with an immense number of sub-varieties\r\nin the form of the pods and seed. I can only say it may be so.\r\n\r\nIf the common haricot was formerly known in Greece, it was not one of\r\nthe earliest introductions, for the _faseolos_ did not exist at Rome in\r\nCato’s time, and it is only at the beginning of the empire that Latin\r\nauthors speak of it. Virchow brought from the excavations at Troy the\r\nseeds of several leguminæ, which Wittmack[1702] has ascertained to\r\nbelong to the following species: broad bean (_Faba vulgaris_),\r\ngarden-pea (_Pisum sativum_), ervilla (_Ervum ervilia_), and perhaps the\r\nflat-podded vetchling (_Lathyrus Cicera_), but no haricot. Nor has the\r\nspecies been found in the lake-dwellings of Switzerland, Savoy, Austria,\r\nand Italy.\r\n\r\nThere are no proofs or signs of its existence in ancient Egypt. No\r\nHebrew name is known answering to the _Phaseolus_ or _Dolichos_ of\r\nbotanists. A less ancient name, for it is Arabic, _loubia_, exists in\r\nEgypt for _Dolichos lubia_, and in Hindustani as _loba_ for _Phaseolus\r\nvulgaris_.[1703] As regards the latter species, Piddington only gives\r\ntwo names in modern languages, and those both Hindustani, _loba_ and\r\n_bakla_. This, together with the absence of a Sanskrit name, points to a\r\nrecent introduction into Southern Asia. Chinese authors do not mention\r\n_P. vulgaris_,[1704] which is a further indication of a recent\r\nintroduction into India, and also into Bactriana, whence the Chinese\r\nhave imported plants from the second century of our era.\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances incline me to doubt whether the species was\r\nknown in Asia before the Christian era. The argument based upon the\r\nmodern Greek and Italian names for the haricot, derived from _fasiolos_,\r\nneeds some support. It may be said in its favour that it was used in the\r\nMiddle Ages, probably for the common haricot. In the list of vegetables\r\nwhich Charlemagne commanded to be sown in his farms, we find\r\n_fasiolum_,[1705] without explanation. Albertus Magnus describes under\r\nthe name _faseolus_ a leguminous plant which appears to be our dwarf\r\nharicot.[1706] I notice, on the other hand, that writers in the\r\nfifteenth century, such as Pierre Crescenzio[1707] and Macer\r\nFloridus,[1708] mention no _faseolus_ or similar name. On the other\r\nhand, after the discovery of America, from the sixteenth century all\r\nauthors publish descriptions and drawings of _Phaseolus vulgaris_, with\r\na number of varieties.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful that its cultivation is ancient in tropical Africa. It is\r\nindicated there less often than that of other species of the Dolichos\r\nand Phaseolus genera.\r\n\r\nIt had not occurred to any one to seek the origin of the haricot in\r\nAmerica till, quite recently, some remarkable discoveries of fruits and\r\nseeds were made in Peruvian tombs at Ancon, near Lima. Rochebrune[1709]\r\npublished a list of the species of different families from the\r\ncollection made by Cossac and Savatier. Among the number are three kinds\r\nof haricot, none of which, says the author, is _Phaseolus vulgaris_; but\r\nWittmack,[1710] who studied the leguminæ brought from these same tombs\r\nby Reiss and Stubel, says he made out several varieties of the common\r\nharicot among other seeds belonging to _Phaseolus lunatus_, Linnæus. He\r\nhad identified them with the varieties of _P. vulgaris_ called by\r\nbotanists _Oblongus purpureus_ (Martens), _Ellipticus præcox_ (Alefeld),\r\nand _Ellipticus atrofuscus_ (Alefeld), which belong to the category of\r\ndwarf or branchless haricots.\r\n\r\nIt is not certain that the tombs in question are all anterior to the\r\nadvent of the Spaniards. The work of Reiss and Stubel, now in the press,\r\nwill perhaps give some information on this head; but Wittmack admits, on\r\ntheir authority, that some of the tombs are not ancient. I notice a\r\nfact, however, which has passed without observation. The fifty species\r\nof Rochebrune are all American. There is not one which can be suspected\r\nto be of European origin. Evidently these plants and seeds were either\r\ndeposited before the conquest, or, in certain tombs which perhaps belong\r\nto a subsequent epoch, the inhabitants took care not to put species of\r\nforeign origin. This was natural enough according to their ideas, for\r\nthe custom of depositing plants in the tombs was not a result of the\r\nCatholic religion, but was an inheritance from the customs and opinions\r\nof the natives. The presence of the common haricot among exclusively\r\nAmerican plants seems to me important, whatever the date of the tombs.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that the seeds are insufficient ground for\r\ndetermining the species of a _phaseolus_, and that several species of\r\nthis genus which are not yet well known were cultivated in South America\r\nbefore the arrival of the Spaniards. Molina[1711] speaks of thirteen or\r\nfourteen species (or varieties?) cultivated formerly in Chili alone.\r\n\r\nWittmack insists upon the general and ancient use of the haricot in\r\nseveral parts of South America. This proves at least that several\r\nspecies were indigenous and cultivated. He quotes the testimony of\r\nJoseph Acosta, one of the first writers after the conquest, who says\r\nthat “the Peruvians cultivated vegetables which they called _frisoles_\r\nand _palares_, and which they used as the Spaniards use _garbanzos_\r\n(chick-pea), beans and lentils. I have not found,” he adds, “that these\r\nor other European vegetables were found here before the coming of the\r\nEuropeans.” _Frisole_, _fajol_, _fasoler_, are Spanish names for the\r\ncommon haricot, corruptions of the Latin _faselus_, _fasolus_,\r\n_faseolus_. _Paller_ is American.\r\n\r\nI may take this opportunity of explaining the origin of the French name\r\nharicot. I sought for it formerly in vain;[1712] but I noticed that\r\nTournefort[1713] (_Instit._, p. 415) was the first to use it. I called\r\nattention also to the existence of the word _arachos_ (Greek: arachos)\r\nin Theophrastus, probably for a kind of vetch, and of the Sanskrit word\r\n_harenso_ for the common pea. I rejected as improbable the notion that\r\nthe name of a vegetable could come from the dish called haricot or\r\nlaricot of mutton, as suggested by an English author, and criticized\r\nBescherelle, who derived the word from Keltic, while the Breton words\r\nare totally different, and signify small bean (_fa-munno_) or kind of\r\npea (_pis-ram_). Lettré, in his dictionary, also seeks the etymology of\r\nthe word. Without any acquaintance with my article, he inclines to the\r\ntheory that _haricot_, the plant, comes from the ragout, seeing that the\r\nlatter is older in the language, and that a certain resemblance may be\r\ntraced between the haricot bean and the morsels of meat in the ragout,\r\nor else that this bean was suitable to the making of the dish. It is\r\ncertain that this vegetable was called in French _faséole_ or _fazéole_,\r\nfrom the Latin name, until nearly the end of the seventeenth century;\r\nbut chance has led me to discover the real origin of the word haricot.\r\nAn Italian name, _araco_, found in Durante and Matthioli, in Latin\r\n_Aracus niger_,[1714] was given to a leguminous plant which modern\r\nbotanists attribute to _Lathyrus ochrus_. It is not surprising that an\r\nItalian seventeenth-century name should be transported by French\r\ncultivators of the following century to another leguminous plant, and\r\nthat _ara_ should have been _ari_. It is the sort of mistake which is\r\ncommon now. Besides, _aracos_ or _arachos_ has been attributed by\r\ncommentators to several _Leguminosœ_ of the genera _Lathyrus_, _Vicia_,\r\netc. Durante gives the Greek _arachos_ as the synonym for his _araco_,\r\nwhereby we see the etymology. Père Feuillée[1715] wrote in French\r\n_aricot_; before him Tournefort spelt it _haricot_, in the belief,\r\nperhaps, that the Greek word was written with an aspirate, which is not\r\nthe case; at least in the best authors.\r\n\r\nI may sum up as follows:—(1) _Phaseolus vulgaris_ has not been long\r\ncultivated in India, the south-west of Asia, and Egypt; (2) it is not\r\ncertain that it was known in Europe before the discovery of America; (3)\r\nat this epoch the number of varieties suddenly increased in European\r\ngardens, and all authors commenced to mention them; (4) the majority of\r\nthe species of the genus exist in South America; (5) seeds apparently\r\nbelonging to the species have been discovered in Peruvian tombs of an\r\nuncertain date, intermixed with many species, all American.\r\n\r\nI do not examine whether _Phaseolus vulgaris_ existed in both\r\nhemispheres previous to cultivation, because examples of this nature are\r\nexceedingly rare among non-aquatic phanerogamous plants of tropical\r\ncountries. Perhaps there is not one in a thousand, and even then human\r\nagency may be suspected.[1716] To open this question in the case of _Ph.\r\nvulgaris_, it should at least be found wild in both old and new worlds,\r\nwhich has not happened. If it had occupied so vast an area, we should\r\nsee signs of it in individuals really wild in widely separate regions on\r\nthe same continent, as is the case with the following species, _Ph.\r\nlunatas_.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Scimetar-podded Kidney Bean+, or +Sugar Bean+.—_Phaseolus lunatus_,\r\nLinnæus; _Phaseo lunatus macrocarpus_; Bentham, _Ph. inamœnus_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis haricot, as well as that called _Lima_, is so widely diffused in\r\ntropical countries, that it has been described under different\r\nnames.[1717] All these forms can be classed in two groups, of which\r\nLinnæus made different species. The commonest in our gardens is that\r\nwhich has been called since the beginning of the century the _Lima\r\nharicot_. It may be distinguished by its height, by the size of its pods\r\nand beans. It lasts several years in countries which are favourable to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLinnæus believed that his _Ph. lunatus_ came from Bengal and the other\r\nfrom Africa, but he gives no proof. For a century his assertions were\r\nrepeated. Now, Bentham,[1718] who is careful about origins, believes the\r\nspecies and its variety to be certainly American; he only doubts about\r\nits presence as a wild plant both in Africa and Asia. I see no\r\nindication whatever of ancient existence in Asia. The plant has never\r\nbeen found wild, and it has no name in the modern languages of India or\r\nin Sanskrit.[1719] It is not mentioned in Chinese works. Anglo-Indians\r\ncall it French bean,[1720] like the common haricot, which shows how\r\nmodern is its cultivation.\r\n\r\nIt is cultivated in nearly all tropical Africa. However, Schweinfurth\r\nand Ascherson[1721] do not mention it for Abyssinia, Nubia, or Egypt.\r\nOliver[1722] quotes a number of specimens found in Guinea and the\r\ninterior of Africa, without saying whether they were wild or cultivated.\r\nIf we suppose the species of African origin or of very early\r\nintroduction, it would have spread to Egypt and thence to India.\r\n\r\nThe facts are quite different for South America. Bentham mentions wild\r\nspecimens from the Amazon basin and Central Brazil. They belong\r\nespecially to the large variety (_macrocarpus_), which abounds also in\r\nthe Peruvian tombs of Ancon, according to Wittmack.[1723] It is\r\nevidently a Brazilian species, diffused by cultivation, and perhaps long\r\nsince naturalized here and there in tropical America. I am inclined to\r\nbelieve it was introduced into Guinea by the slave trade, and that it\r\nspread thence into the interior and the coast of Mozambique.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Moth+, or +Aconite-leaved Kidney Bean+—_Phaseolus aconitifolius_,\r\nWilldenow.\r\n\r\nAn annual species grown in India as fodder, and of which the seeds are\r\neatable, though but little valued. The Hindustani name is _mout_, among\r\nthe Sikhs _moth_. It is somewhat like _Ph. trilobus_, which is\r\ncultivated for the seed. _Ph. aconitifolius_ is wild in British India\r\nfrom Ceylon to the Himalayas.[1724] The absence of a Sanskrit name, and\r\nof different names in modern Indian languages, points to a recent\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Three-lobed Kidney Bean+—_Phaseolus trilobus_, Willdenow.\r\n\r\nOne of the most commonly cultivated species in India;[1725] at least in\r\nthe last few years, for Roxburgh,[1726] at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, had only seen it wild. All authors agree in considering it as\r\nwild from the foot of the Himalayas to Ceylon. It also exists in Nubia,\r\nAbyssinia, and Zambesi;[1727] it is not said whether wild or cultivated.\r\nPiddington gives a Sanskrit name, and several names in modern Indian\r\nlanguages, which shows that the species has been cultivated, or at least\r\nknown for three thousand years.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Green Gram+, or +Múng+—_Phaseolus mungo_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nA species commonly cultivated in India and in the Nile Valley. The\r\nconsiderable number of varieties, and the existence of three different\r\nnames in the modern languages of India, point to a cultivation of one or\r\ntwo thousand years, but there is no Sanskrit name.[1728] In Africa it is\r\nprobably recent. Anglo-Indian botanists agree that it is wild in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Lablab+, or +Wall+—_Dolichos Lablab_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis species is much cultivated in India and tropical Africa. Roxburgh\r\ncounts as many as seven varieties with Indian names. Piddington quotes\r\nin his _Index_ a Sanskrit name, _schimbi_, which recurs in modern\r\nlanguages. Its culture dates perhaps from three thousand years. Yet the\r\nspecies was not anciently diffused in China, or in Western Asia and\r\nEgypt; at least, I can find no trace of it. The little extension of\r\nthese edible _Leguminosæ_ beyond India in ancient times is a singular\r\nfact. It is possible that their cultivation is not of ancient date.\r\n\r\nThe lablab is undoubtedly wild in India, and also, it is said, in\r\nJava.[1729] It has become naturalized from cultivation in the\r\nSeychelles.[1730] The indications of authors are not positive enough to\r\nsay whether it is wild in Africa.[1731]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Lubia+—_Dolichos Lubia_, Forskal.\r\n\r\nThis species, cultivated in Europe under the name of _lubia_, _loubya_,\r\n_loubyé_, according to Forskal and Delile,[1732] is little known to\r\nbotanists. According to the latter author it exists also in Syria,\r\nPersia, and India; but I do not find this in any way confirmed in modern\r\nworks on these two countries. Schweinfurth and Ascherson[1733] admit it\r\nas a distinct species, cultivated in the Nile Valley. Hitherto no one\r\nhas found it wild. No _Dolichos_ or _Phaseolus_ is known in the\r\nmonuments of ancient Egypt. We shall see from the evidence of the common\r\nnames that these plants were probably introduced into Egyptian\r\nagriculture after the time of the Pharaohs.\r\n\r\nThe name _lubia_ is used by the Berbers, unchanged, and by the Spaniards\r\nas _alubia_ for the common haricot, _Phaseolus vulgaris_. Although\r\n_Phaseolus_ and _Dolichos_ are very similar, this is an example of the\r\nlittle value of common names as a proof of species. _Loba_ is, as we\r\nhave seen, one of the Hindustani names for _Phaseolus vulgaris_,[1734]\r\nand _lobia_ that of _Dolichos sinensis_ in the same language.[1735]\r\nOrientalists should tell us whether _lubia_ is an old word in Semitic\r\nlanguages. I do not find a similar name in Hebrew, and it is possible\r\nthat the Armenians or the Arabs took _lubia_ from the Greek _lobos_\r\n(λοβος), which means any projection, like the lobe of the ear, a fruit\r\nof the nature of a pod, and more particularly, according to Galen, _Ph.\r\nvulgaris_. _Lobion_ (Λοβιον) in Dioscorides is the fruit of _Ph.\r\nvulgaris_, at least in the opinion of commentators.[1736] It remains as\r\n_loubion_ in modern Greek, with the same meaning.[1737]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Bambarra Ground Nut+—_Glycine subterranea_, Linnæus, junr.; _Voandzeia\r\nsubterranea_, Petit Thouars.\r\n\r\nThe earliest travellers in Madagascar remarked this leguminous annual,\r\ncultivated by the natives for the pod or seed, dressed like peas, French\r\nbeans, etc. It resembles the earth, particularly in that the flower-stem\r\ncurves downwards, and plunges the young fruit or pod into the earth. Its\r\ncultivation is common in the gardens of tropical Africa, and it is\r\nfound, but less frequently, in those of Southern Asia.[1738] It seems\r\nthat it is not much grown in America,[1739] except in Brazil, where it\r\nis called _mandubi di Angola_.[1740]\r\n\r\nEarly writers on Asia do not mention it; its origin must, therefore, be\r\nsought in Africa. Loureiro[1741] had seen it on the eastern coast of\r\nthis continent, and Petit Thouars in Madagascar, but they do not say\r\nthat it was wild. The authors of the flora of Senegambia[1742] described\r\nit as “cultivated and probably wild” in Galam. Lastly, Schweinfurth and\r\nAscherson[1743] found it wild on the banks of the Nile from Khartoum to\r\nGondokoro. In spite of the possibility of naturalization from\r\ncultivation, it is extremely probable that the plant is wild in tropical\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Buckwheat+—_Polygonum fagopyrum_, Linnæus; _Fagopyrum esculentum_,\r\nMœnch.\r\n\r\nThe history of this species has been completely cleared up in the last\r\nfew years. It grows wild in Mantschuria, on the banks of the river\r\nAmur,[1744] in Dahuria, and near Lake Baikal.[1745] It is also indicated\r\nin China and in the mountains of the north of India,[1746] but I do not\r\nfind that in these regions its wild character is certain. Roxburgh has\r\nonly seen it in a cultivated state in the north of India, and\r\nBretschneider[1747] thinks it doubtful that it is indigenous in China.\r\nIts cultivation is not ancient, for the first Chinese author who\r\nmentions it lived in the tenth or eleventh century of the Christian era.\r\n\r\nBuckwheat is cultivated in the Himalayas under the names _ogal_ or\r\n_ogla_ and _kouton_.[1748] As there is no Sanskrit name for this species\r\nnor for the two following, I doubt the antiquity of their cultivation in\r\nthe mountains of Central Asia. It was certainly unknown to the Greeks\r\nand Romans. The name _fagopyrum_ is an invention of modern botanists\r\nfrom the similarity in the shape of the seed to a beech-nut, whence also\r\nthe German _buchweitzen_[1749] (corrupted in English into buckwheat) and\r\nthe Italian _faggina_.\r\n\r\nThe names of this plant in European languages of Aryan origin have not a\r\ncommon root. Thus the western Aryans did not know the species any more\r\nthan the Sanskrit-speaking Orientals, a further sign of the nonexistence\r\nof the plant in the mountains of Central Asia. Even at the present day\r\nit is probably unknown in the north of Persia and in Turkey, since\r\nfloras do not mention it.[1750] Bosc states, in the _Dictionnaire\r\nd’Agriculture_, that Olivier had seen it wild in Persia, but I do not\r\nfind this in this naturalist’s published account of his travels.\r\n\r\nThe species came into Europe in the Middle Ages, through Tartary and\r\nRussia. The first mention of its cultivation in Germany occurs in a\r\nMecklenburg register of 1436.[1751] In the sixteenth century it spread\r\ntowards the centre of Europe, and in poor soil, as in Brittany, it\r\nbecame important. Reynier, who, as a rule, is very accurate, imagined\r\nthat the French name _sarrasin_ was Keltic;[1752] but M. le Gall wrote\r\nto me formerly that the Breton names simply mean black wheat or black\r\ncorn, _ed-du_ and _gwinis-du_. There is no original name in Keltic\r\nlanguages, which seems natural now that we know the origin of the\r\nspecies.[1753]\r\n\r\nWhen the plant was introduced into Belgium and into France, and even\r\nwhen it became known in Italy, that is to say in the sixteenth century,\r\nthe name _blé sarrasin_ (Saracen wheat) or _sarrasin_ was commonly\r\nadopted. Common names are often so absurd, and so unthinkingly bestowed,\r\nthat we cannot tell in this particular case whether the name refers to\r\nthe colour of the grain which was that attributed to the Saracens, or to\r\nthe supposed introduction from the country of the Arabs or Moors. It was\r\nnot then known that the species did not exist in the countries south of\r\nthe Mediterranean, nor even in Syria and Persia. It is also possible\r\nthat the idea of a southern origin was taken from the name _sarrasin_,\r\nwhich was given from the colour. This origin was admitted until the end\r\nof the last and even in the present century.[1754] Reynier was, fifty\r\nyears ago, the first to oppose it.\r\n\r\nBuckwheat sometimes escapes from cultivation and becomes quasi-wild. The\r\nnearer we approach its original country the more often this occurs,\r\nwhence it results that it is hard to define the limit of the wild plant\r\non the confines of Europe and Asia, in the Himalayas, and in China. In\r\nJapan these semi-naturalizations are not rare.[1755]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Tartary Buckwheat+—_Polygonum tataricum_, Linnæus; _Fagopyrum\r\ntataricum_, Gærtner.\r\n\r\nLess sensitive to cold than the common buckwheat, but yielding a poorer\r\nkind of seed, this species is sometimes cultivated in Europe and Asia—in\r\nthe Himalayas,[1756] for instance; but its culture is recent. Authors of\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries do not mention it, and Linnæus\r\nwas one of the first to speak of it as of Tartar origin. Roxburgh and\r\nHamilton had not seen it in Northern India in the beginning of this\r\ncentury, and I find no indication of it in China and Japan.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly wild in Tartary and Siberia, as far as Dauria;[1757]\r\nbut Russian botanists have not found it further east, in the basin of\r\nthe river Amur.[1758]\r\n\r\nAs this plant came from Tartary into Eastern Europe later than the\r\ncommon buckwheat, it is the latter which bears in several Slav languages\r\nthe names _tatrika_, _tatarka_, or _tattar_, which would better suit the\r\nTartary buckwheat.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the Aryan peoples must have known the species, and yet no\r\nname is mentioned in the ancient Indo-European languages. No trace of it\r\nhas hitherto been found in the lake-dwellings of Switzerland or of\r\nSavoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Notch-seeded Buckwheat+—_Polygonum emarginatum_, Roth; _Fagopyrum\r\nemarginatum_, Meissner.\r\n\r\nThis third species of buckwheat is grown in the highlands of the\r\nnorth-east of India, under the name _phaphra_ or _phaphar_,[1759] and in\r\nChina.[1760] I find no positive proof that it has been found wild. Roth\r\nonly says that it “inhabits China,” and that the grain is used for\r\nfood. Don,[1761] who was the first of Anglo-Indian botanists to mention\r\nit, says that it is hardly considered wild. It is not mentioned in\r\nfloras of the Amur valley, nor of Japan. Judging from the countries\r\nwhere it is cultivated, it is probably wild in the Eastern Himalayas and\r\nthe north-west of China.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Fagopyrum_ has eight species, all of temperate Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Quinoa+—_Chenopodium quinoa_, Willdenow.\r\n\r\nThe quinoa was a staple food of the natives of New Granada, Peru, and\r\nChili, in the high and temperate parts at the time of the conquest. Its\r\ncultivation has persisted in these countries from custom, and on account\r\nof the abundance of the product.\r\n\r\nFrom all time the distinction has existed between the quinoa with\r\ncoloured leaves, and the quinoa with green leaves and white seed.[1762]\r\nThe latter was regarded by Moquin[1763] as a variety of a little known\r\nspecies, believed to be Asiatic; but I believe that I showed\r\nconclusively that the two American quinoas are two varieties, probably\r\nvery ancient, of a single species.[1764] The less coloured, which is\r\nalso the most farinaceous, is probably derived from the other.\r\n\r\nThe white quinoa yields a grain which is much esteemed at Lima,\r\naccording to information furnished by the _Botanical Magazine_, where a\r\ngood drawing may be seen (pl. 3641). The leaves may be dressed in the\r\nsame manner as spinach.[1765]\r\n\r\nNo botanist has mentioned the quinoa as wild or semi-wild. The most\r\nrecent and complete work on one of the countries where the species is\r\ncultivated, the _Flora of Chili_, by Cl. Gay, speaks of it only as a\r\ncultivated plant. Père Feuillée and Humboldt said the same for Peru and\r\nNew Granada. It is perhaps due to the insignificance of the plant and\r\nits aspect of a garden weed that collectors have neglected to bring back\r\nwild specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Kiery+—_Amarantus frumentaceus_, Roxburgh.\r\n\r\nThis annual is cultivated in the Indian peninsula for its small\r\nfarinaceous grain, which is in some localities the principal food of the\r\nnatives.[1766] Fields of this species, of a red or golden colour,\r\nproduce a beautiful effect.[1767] From Roxburgh’s account, Dr. Buchanan\r\n“discovered it on the hills of Mysore and Coimbatore,” which seems to\r\nindicate a wild condition. _Amarantus speciosus_, cultivated in gardens\r\nand figured on pl. 2227 of the _Botanical Magazine_, appears to be the\r\nsame species. Hamilton found it in Nepal.[1768] A variety or allied\r\nspecies, _Amarantus anardana_, Wallich,[1769] is grown on the slopes of\r\nthe Himalayas, but has been hitherto ill defined by botanists. Other\r\nspecies are used as vegetables (see p. 100, _Amarantus gangeticus_).\r\n\r\n\r\n+Chestnut+—_Castanea vulgaris_, Lamarck.\r\n\r\nThe chestnut, belonging to the order _Cupuliferæ_, has an extended but\r\ndisjunctive natural area. It forms forests and woods in mountainous\r\nparts of the temperate zone from the Caspian Sea to Portugal. It has\r\nalso been found in the mountains of Edough in Algeria, and more recently\r\ntowards the frontier of Tunis (Letourneux). If we take into account the\r\nvarieties _japonica_ and _americana_, it exists also in Japan and in the\r\ntemperate region of North America.[1770] It has been sown or planted in\r\nseveral parts of the south and west of Europe, and it is now difficult\r\nto know if it is wild or cultivated. However, cultivation consists\r\nchiefly in the operation of grafting good varieties on the trees which\r\nyield indifferent fruit. For this purpose the variety which produces but\r\none large kernel is preferred to those which bear two or three,\r\nseparated by a membrane, which is the natural state of the species.\r\n\r\nThe Romans in Pliny’s time[1771] already distinguished eight varieties,\r\nbut we cannot discover from the text of this author whether they\r\npossessed the variety with a single kernel (Fr. _marron_). The best\r\nchestnuts came from Sardis in Asia Minor, and from the neighbourhood of\r\nNaples. Olivier de Serres,[1772] in the sixteenth century, praises the\r\nchestnuts _Sardonne_ and _Tuscane_, which produced the single-kernelled\r\nfruit called the _Lyons marron_.[1773] He considered that these\r\nvarieties came from Italy, and Targioni[1774] tells us that the name\r\n_marrone_ or _marone_ was employed in that country in the Middle Ages\r\n(1170).\r\n\r\n\r\n+Wheat and Kindred Species.+—The innumerable varieties of wheat,\r\nproperly so called, of which the ripened grain detaches itself naturally\r\nfrom the husk, have been classed into four groups by Vilmorin,[1775]\r\nwhich form distinct species, or modifications of the common wheat\r\naccording to different authors. I am obliged to distinguish them in\r\norder to study their history, but this, as will be seen, supports the\r\nopinion of a single species.[1776]\r\n\r\n\r\n+1. Common Wheat+—_Triticum vulgare_, Villars; _Triticum hybernum_ and\r\n_T. æstivum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nAccording to the experiments of the Abbé Rozier, and later of Tessier,\r\nthe distinction between autumn and spring wheats has no importance. “All\r\nwheats,” says the latter,[1777] “are either spring or autumn sown,\r\naccording to the country. They all pass with time from the one state to\r\nthe other, as I have ascertained. They only need to be gradually\r\naccustomed to the change, by sowing the autumn wheat a little later,\r\nspring wheat a little earlier, year by year.” The fact is that among the\r\nimmense number of varieties there are some which feel the cold of the\r\nwinter more than others, and it has become the custom to sow them in the\r\nspring.[1778] We need take no note of this distinction in studying the\r\nquestion of origin, especially as the greater number of the varieties\r\nthus obtained date from a remote period.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of wheat is prehistoric in the old world. Very ancient\r\nEgyptian monuments, older than the invasion of the shepherds, and the\r\nHebrew Scriptures show this cultivation already established, and when\r\nthe Egyptians or Greeks speak of its origin, they attribute it to\r\nmythical personages, Isis, Ceres, Triptolemus.[1779] The earliest\r\nlake-dwellings of Western Switzerland cultivated a small-grained wheat,\r\nwhich Heer[1780] has carefully described and figured under the name\r\n_Triticum vulgare antiquorum_. From various facts, taken collectively,\r\nwe gather that the first lake-dwellers of Robenhausen were at least\r\ncontemporary with the Trojan war, and perhaps earlier. The cultivation\r\nof their wheat persisted in Switzerland until the Roman conquest, as we\r\nsee from specimens found at Buchs. Regazzoni also found it in the\r\nrubbish-heaps of the lake-dwellers of Varese, and Sordelli in those of\r\nLagozza in Lombardy.[1781] Unger found the same form in a brick of the\r\npyramid of Dashur, Egypt, to which he assigns a date, 3359 B.C. (Unger,\r\n_Bot. Streifzüge_, vii.; _Ein Ziegel_, etc., p. 9), Another variety\r\n(_Triticum vulgare compactum muticum_, Heer) was less common in\r\nSwitzerland in the earliest stone age, but it has been more often found\r\namong the less ancient lake-dwellers of Western Switzerland and of\r\nItaly.[1782] A third intermediate variety has been discovered at\r\nAggtelek in Hungary, cultivated in the stone age.[1783] None of these is\r\nidentical with the wheat now cultivated, as more profitable varieties\r\nhave taken their place.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, who grew wheat 2700 B.C., considered it a gift direct from\r\nheaven.[1784] In the annual ceremony of sowing five kinds of seed,\r\ninstituted by the Emperor Shen-nung or Chin-nong, wheat is one species,\r\nthe others being rice, sorghum, _Setaria italica_, and soy.\r\n\r\nThe existence of different names for wheat in the most ancient\r\nlanguages confirms the belief in a great antiquity of cultivation. The\r\nChinese name is _mai_, the Sanskrit _sumana_ and _gôdhûma_, the Hebrew\r\n_chittah_, Egyptian _br_, Guancho _yrichen_, without mentioning several\r\nnames in languages derived from the primitive Sanskrit, nor a Basque\r\nname, _ogaia_ or _okhaya_, which dates perhaps from the Iberians,[1785]\r\nand several Finn, Tartar, and Turkish names, etc.,[1786] which are\r\nprobably Turanian. This great diversity might be explained by a wide\r\nnatural area in the case of a very common wild plant, but this is far\r\nfrom being the case of wheat. On the contrary, it is difficult to prove\r\nits existence in a wild state in a few places in Western Asia, as we\r\nshall see. If it had been widely diffused before cultivation,\r\ndescendants would have remained here and there in remote countries. The\r\nmanifold names of ancient languages must, therefore, be attributed to\r\nthe extreme antiquity of its culture in the temperate parts of Europe,\r\nAsia, and Africa—an antiquity greater than that of the most ancient\r\nlanguages. We have two methods of discovering the home of the species\r\nprevious to cultivation in the immense zone stretching from China to the\r\nCanaries: first, the opinion of ancient authors; second, the existence,\r\nmore or less proved, of wheat in a wild state in a given country.\r\n\r\nAccording to the earliest of all historians, Berosus, a Chaldean priest,\r\nfragments of whose writings have been preserved by Herodotus, wild wheat\r\n(_Frumentum agreste_[1787]) might be seen growing in Mesopotamia. The\r\ntexts of the Bible alluding to the abundance of wheat in Canaan prove no\r\nmore than that the plant was cultivated there, and that it was very\r\nproductive. Strabo,[1788] born 50 B.C., says that, according to\r\nAristobulus, a grain very similar to wheat grew wild upon the banks of\r\nthe Indus on the 25th parallel of latitude. He also says[1789] that in\r\nHircania (the modern Mazanderan) the grains of wheat which fell from\r\nthe ear sowed themselves. This may be observed to some degree at the\r\npresent day in all countries, and the author says nothing upon the\r\nimportant question whether this accidental sowing reproduced itself in\r\nthe same place from generation to generation. According to the\r\n_Odyssey_,[1790] wheat grew in Sicily without the help of man. But it is\r\nimpossible to attach great importance to the words of a poet, and of a\r\npoet whose very existence is contested. Diodorus Siculus at the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era says the same thing, and deserves greater\r\nconfidence, since he is a Sicilian. Yet he may easily have been mistaken\r\nas to the wild character, as wheat was then generally cultivated in\r\nSicily. Another passage in Diodorus[1791] mentions the tradition that\r\nOsiris found wheat and barley growing promiscuously with other plants at\r\nNisa, and Dureau de la Malle has proved that this town was in Palestine.\r\nAmong all this evidence, that of Berosus and that of Strabo for\r\nMesopotamia and Western India alone appear to me of any value.\r\n\r\nThe five species of seed of the ceremony instituted by Chin-nong are\r\nconsidered by Chinese scholars to be natives of their country,[1792] and\r\nBretschneider adds that communication between China and Western Asia\r\ndates only from the embassy of Chang-kien in the second century before\r\nChrist. A more positive assertion is needed, however, before we can\r\nbelieve wheat to be indigenous in China; for a plant cultivated in\r\nwestern Asia two or three thousand years before the epoch of Chin-nong,\r\nand of which the seeds are so easily transported, may have been\r\nintroduced into the north of China by isolated and unknown travellers,\r\nas the stones of peaches and apricots were probably carried from China\r\ninto Persia in prehistoric time.\r\n\r\nBotanists have ascertained that wheat is not wild in Sicily at the\r\npresent day.[1793] It sometimes escapes from cultivation, but it does\r\nnot persist indefinitely.[1794] The plant which the inhabitants call\r\nwild wheat, _Frumentu sarvaggiu_, which covers uncultivated ground, is\r\n_Ægilops ovata_, according to Inzenga.[1795]\r\n\r\nA zealous collector, Balansa, believed that he had found wheat growing\r\non Mount Sipylus, in Asia Minor, under circumstances in which it was\r\nimpossible not to believe it wild;[1796] but the plant he brought back\r\nis a spelt, _Triticum monococcum_, according to a very careful botanist,\r\nto whom it was submitted for examination.[1797] Olivier,[1798] before\r\nhim, when he was on the right bank of the Euphrates, to the north-west\r\nof Anah, a country unfit for cultivation, “found in a kind of ravine,\r\nwheat, barley, and spelt, which,” he adds, “we have already seen several\r\ntimes in Mesopotamia.”\r\n\r\nLinnæus says,[1799] that Heintzelmann found wheat in the country of the\r\nBaschkirs, but no one has confirmed this statement, and no modern\r\nbotanist has seen the species really wild in the neighbourhood of the\r\nCaucasus or the north of Persia. Bunge,[1800] whose attention was drawn\r\nto this point, declares that he has seen no indication which leads him\r\nto believe that cereals are indigenous in that country. It does not even\r\nappear that wheat has a tendency in these regions to spring up\r\naccidentally outside cultivated ground. I have not discovered any\r\nmention of it as a wild plant in the north of India, in China, or\r\nMongolia.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that wheat has been twice asserted to be indigenous in\r\nMesopotamia, at an interval of twenty three centuries, once by Berosus,\r\nand once by Olivier in our own day. The Euphrates valley lying nearly in\r\nthe middle of the belt of cultivation which formerly extended from China\r\nto the Canaries, it is infinitely probable that it was the principal\r\nhabitation of the species in very early prehistoric times. The area may\r\nhave extended towards Syria, as the climate is very similar, but to the\r\neast and west of Western Asia wheat has probably never existed but as a\r\ncultivated plant; anterior, it is true, to all known civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n+2. Turgid+, and +Egyptian Wheat+—_Triticum turgidum_ and _T.\r\ncompositum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous common names of the varieties which come under this\r\nhead, we find that of Egyptian wheat. It appears that it is now much\r\ncultivated in that country and in the whole of the Nile valley. A. P. de\r\nCandolle says[1801] that he recognized this wheat amongst seeds taken\r\nfrom the sarcophagi of ancient mummies, but he had not seen the ears.\r\nUnger[1802] thinks it was cultivated by the ancient Egyptians, yet he\r\ngives no proof founded on drawings or specimens. The fact that no Hebrew\r\nor Armenian name[1803] can be attributed to the species seems to me\r\nimportant. It proves at least that the remarkable forms with branching\r\nears, commonly called _wheat of miracle_, _wheat of abundance_, did not\r\nexist in antiquity, for they would not have escaped the knowledge of the\r\nIsraelites. No Sanskrit name is known, nor even any modern Indian names,\r\nand I cannot discover any Persian name. The Arab names which\r\nDelile[1804] attributes to the species belong perhaps to other varieties\r\nof wheat. There is no Berber name.[1805] From all this it results, I\r\nthink, that the plants united under the name of _Triticum turgidum_, and\r\nespecially the varieties with branching ears, are not ancient in the\r\nnorth of Africa or in the west of Asia.\r\n\r\nOswald Heer,[1806] in his curious paper upon the plants of the\r\nlake-dwellers of the stone age in Switzerland, attributes to _T.\r\nturgidum_ two non-branched ears, the one bearded, the other almost\r\nwithout beard, of which he gives drawings. Later, in an exploration of\r\nthe lake-dwellings of Robenhausen, Messicommer did not find it, although\r\nthere was abundant store of grain.[1807] Strœbel and Pigorini said they\r\nfound wheat with _grano grosso duro_ (_T. turgidum_), in the\r\nlake-dwellings of Parmesan.[1808] For the rest, Heer[1809] considers\r\nthis to be a variety or race of the common wheat, and Sordelli inclines\r\nto the same opinion.\r\n\r\nFraas thinks that the _krithanias_ of Theophrastus was _T. turgidum_,\r\nbut this is absolutely uncertain. According to Heldreich,[1810] the\r\ngreat wheat is of modern introduction into Greece. Pliny[1811] spoke\r\nbriefly of a wheat with branching ears, yielding one hundred grains,\r\nwhich was most likely our _miraculous wheat_.\r\n\r\nThus history and philology alike lead us to consider the varieties of\r\n_Triticum turgidum_ as modifications of the common wheat obtained by\r\ncultivation. The form with branching ears is not perhaps earlier than\r\nPliny’s time.\r\n\r\nThese deductions would be overthrown by the discovery of the _T.\r\nturgidum_ in a wild state, which has not hitherto been made with\r\ncertainty. In spite of C. Koch,[1812] no one admits that it grows,\r\noutside cultivation, at Constantinople and in Asia Minor. Boissier’s\r\nherbarium, so rich in Eastern plants, has no specimen of it. It is given\r\nas wild in Egypt by Schweinfurth, and Ascherson, but this is the result\r\nof a misprint.[1813]\r\n\r\n\r\n+3. Hard Wheat+—_Triticum durum_, Desfontaines.\r\n\r\nLong cultivated in Barbary, in the south of Switzerland and elsewhere,\r\nit has never been found wild. In the different provinces of Spain it has\r\nno less than fifteen names,[1814] and none are derived from the Arab\r\nname _quemah_ used in Algeria[1815] and Egypt.[1816] The absence of\r\nnames in several other countries, especially of original names, is very\r\nstriking. This is a further indication of a derivation from the common\r\nwheat obtained in Spain and the north of Africa at an unknown epoch,\r\nperhaps within the Christian era.\r\n\r\n\r\n+4. Polish Wheat+—_Triticum polonicum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis other hard wheat, with yet longer grain, cultivated chiefly in the\r\neast of Europe, has not been found wild. It has an original name in\r\nGerman, _Gäner_, _Gommer_, _Gümmer_,[1817] and in other languages names\r\nwhich are connected only with persons or with countries whence the seed\r\nwas obtained. It cannot be doubted that it is a form obtained by\r\ncultivation, probably in the east of Europe, at an unknown, perhaps\r\nrecent epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion as to the Specific Unity of the Principal Races of Wheat._\r\n\r\nWe have just shown that the history and the vernacular names of the\r\ngreat races of wheat are in favour of a derivation contemporary with\r\nman, probably not very ancient, from the common kind of wheat, perhaps\r\nfrom the small-grained wheat formerly cultivated by the Egyptians, and\r\nby the lake-dwellers of Switzerland and Italy. Alefeld[1818] arrived at\r\nthe specific unity of _T. vulgare_, _T. turgidum_, and _T. durum_, by\r\nmeans of an attentive observation of the three cultivated together,\r\nunder the same conditions. The experiments of Henri Vilmorin[1819] on\r\nthe artificial fertilization of these wheats lead to the same result.\r\nAlthough the author has not yet seen the product of several generations,\r\nhe has ascertained that the most distinct principal forms can be crossed\r\nwith ease and produce fertile hybrids. If fertilization be taken as a\r\nmeasure of the intimate degree of affinity which leads to the grouping\r\nof individuals into the same species, we cannot hesitate in the case in\r\nquestion, especially with the support of the historical considerations\r\nwhich I have given.\r\n\r\n_On the supposed Mummy Wheat._\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this article, I think it pertinent to say that no\r\ngrain taken from an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus and sown by\r\nhorticulturists has ever been known to germinate. It is not that the\r\nthing is impossible, for grains are all the better preserved that they\r\nare protected from the air and from variations of temperature or\r\nhumidity, and certainly these conditions are fulfilled by Egyptian\r\nmonuments; but, as a matter of fact, the attempts at raising wheat from\r\nthese ancient seeds have not been successful. The experiment which has\r\nbeen most talked of is that of the Count of Sternberg, at Prague.[1820]\r\nHe had received the grains from a trustworthy traveller, who assured him\r\nthey were taken from a sarcophagus. Two of these seeds germinated, it is\r\nsaid, but I have ascertained that in Germany well-informed persons\r\nbelieve there is some imposture, either on the part of the Arabs, who\r\nsometimes slip modern seeds into the tombs (even maize, an American\r\nplant), or on that of the _employés_ of the Count of Sternberg. The\r\ngrain known in commerce as mummy wheat has never had any proof of\r\nantiquity of origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Spelt and Allied Varieties or Species.+[1821]\r\n\r\nLouis Vilmorin,[1822] in imitation of Seringe’s excellent work on\r\ncereals,[1823] has grouped together those wheats whose seeds when ripe\r\nare closely contained in their envelope or husk, necessitating a special\r\noperation to free them from it, a character rather agricultural than\r\nbotanical. He then enumerates the forms of these wheats under three\r\nnames, which correspond to as many species of most botanists.\r\n\r\n\r\n+1. Spelt+—_Triticum spelta_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nSpelt is now hardly cultivated out of south Germany and\r\nGerman-Switzerland. This was not the case formerly. The descriptions of\r\ncereals by Greek authors are so brief and insignificant that there is\r\nalways room for hesitation as to the sense of the words they use. Yet,\r\njudging from the customs of which they speak, scholars think[1824] that\r\nthe Greeks first called spelt _olyra_, afterwards _zeia_, names which we\r\nfind in Herodotus and Homer. Dioscorides[1825] distinguishes two sorts\r\nof _zeia_, which apparently answer to _Triticum spelta_ and _T.\r\nmonococcum_. It is believed that spelt was the _semen_ (corn, _par\r\nexcellence_) and the _far_ of Pliny, which he said was used as food by\r\nthe Latins for 360 years before they knew how to make bread.[1826] As\r\nspelt has not been found among the lake-dwellers of Switzerland and\r\nItaly, and as the former cultivated the allied varieties called _T.\r\ndicoccum_ and _T. monococcum_,[1827] it is possible that the _far_ of\r\nthe Latins was rather one of these.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the true spelt in ancient Egypt and the neighbouring\r\ncountries seems to me yet more doubtful. The _olyra_ of the Egyptians,\r\nof which Herodotus speaks, was not the _olyra_ of the Greeks; some\r\nauthors have supposed it to be rice, _oryza_.[1828] As to spelt, it is a\r\nplant which is not grown in such hot countries. Modern travellers from\r\nRauwolf onwards have not seen it in Egyptian cultivation,[1829] nor has\r\nit been found in the ancient monuments. This is what led me to\r\nsuppose[1830] that the Hebrew word _kussemeth_, which occurs three\r\ntimes in the Bible,[1831] ought not to be attributed to spelt, as it is\r\nby Hebrew scholars.[1832] I imagined it was perhaps the allied form, _T.\r\nmonococcum_, but neither is this grown in Egypt.\r\n\r\nSpelt has no name in Sanskrit, nor in any modern Indian languages, nor\r\nin Persian,[1833] and therefore, of course, none in Chinese. European\r\nnames, on the contrary, are numerous, and bear witness to an ancient\r\ncultivation, especially in the east of Europe. _Spelta_ in Saxon, whence\r\nthe English name, and the French, _épeautre_; _Dinkel_ in modern German,\r\n_orkiss_ in Polish, _pobla_ in Russian,[1834] are names which seem to\r\ncome from very different roots. In the south of Europe the names are\r\nrarer. There is a Spanish one, however, of Asturia, _escandia_,[1835]\r\nbut I know of none in Basque.\r\n\r\nHistory, and especially philology, point to an origin in eastern\r\ntemperate Europe and the neighbouring countries of Asia. We have to\r\ndiscover whether the plant has been found wild.\r\n\r\nOlivier,[1836] in a passage already quoted, says that he several times\r\nfound it in Mesopotamia, in particular upon the right bank of the\r\nEuphrates, north of Anah, in places unfit for cultivation. Another\r\nbotanist, André Michaux, saw it in 1783, near Hamadan, a town in the\r\ntemperate region of Persia. Dureau de la Malle says that he sent some\r\ngrains of it to Bosc, who sowed them at Paris and obtained the common\r\nspelt; but this seems to me doubtful, for Lamarck, in 1786,[1837] and\r\nBosc himself, in the _Dictionnaire d’Agriculture_, article _Épeautre_\r\n(spelt), published in 1809, says not a word of this. The herbariums of\r\nthe Paris Museum contain no specimens of the cereals mentioned by\r\nOlivier.\r\n\r\nThere is, as we have seen, much uncertainty as to the origin of the\r\nspecies as a wild plant. This leads me to attribute more importance to\r\nthe hypothesis that spelt is derived by cultivation from the common\r\nwheat, or from an intermediate form at some not very early prehistoric\r\ntime. The experiments of H. Vilmorin[1838] support this theory, for\r\ncross fertilizations of the spelt by the downy white wheat, and _vice\r\nversâ_, yield “hybrids whose fertility is complete, with a mixture of\r\nthe characters of both parents, those of the spelt preponderating.”\r\n\r\n\r\n+2. Starch Wheat+—_Triticum dicoccum_, Schrank; _Triticum amyleum_,\r\nSeringe.\r\n\r\nThis form (_Emmer_, or _Aemer_ in German), cultivated for starch chiefly\r\nin Switzerland, resists a hard winter. It contains two grains in each\r\nlittle ear, like the true spelt.\r\n\r\nHeer[1839] attributes to a variety of _T. dicoccum_ an ear found in a\r\nbad state of preservation in the lake-dwellings of Wangen, Switzerland.\r\nMessicommer has since found some at Robenhausen.\r\n\r\nIt has never been found wild; and the rarity of common names is\r\nremarkable. These two circumstances, and the slight value of the\r\nbotanical characters which serve to distinguish it from _Tr. spelta_,\r\nlead to the conclusion that it is an ancient cultivated variety of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n+3. One-grained Wheat+—_Triticum monococcum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe one-grained wheat, or little spelt, _Einkorn_ in German, is\r\ndistinguished from the two preceding by a single seed in the little ear,\r\nand by other characters which lead the majority of botanists to\r\nconsider it as a really distinct species. The experiments of H. Vilmorin\r\nconfirm this opinion so far, for he has not yet succeeded in crossing\r\n_T. monococcum_ with other spelts or wheats. This may be due, as he says\r\nhimself, to some detail in the manner of operating. He intends to renew\r\nhis attempts, and may perhaps succeed. [In the _Bulletin de la Société\r\nBotanique de France_, 1883, p. 62, Mr. Vilmorin says that he has not met\r\nwith better success in the third and fourth years in his attempts at\r\ncrossing _T. monococcum_ with other species. He intends to make the\r\nexperiment with _T. bœoticum_, Boissier, wild in Servia, of which I sent\r\nhim some seeds gathered by Pancic. As this species is supposed to be the\r\noriginal stock of _T. monococcum_, the experiment is an interesting\r\none.—AUTHOR’S NOTE, 1884.] In the mean time let us see whether this form\r\nof spelt has been long in cultivation, and if it has anywhere been found\r\ngrowing wild.\r\n\r\nThe one-grained wheat thrives in the poorest and most stony soil. It is\r\nnot very productive, but yields excellent meal. It is sown especially in\r\nmountainous districts, in Spain, France, and the east of Europe, but I\r\ndo not find it mentioned in Barbary, Egypt, the East, or in India or\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nFrom some expressions it has been believed to be the _tiphai_ of\r\nTheophrastus.[1840] It is easier to invoke Dioscorides,[1841] for he\r\ndistinguishes two kinds of _zeia_, one with two seeds, another with only\r\none. The latter would be the one-grained wheat. Nothing proves that it\r\nwas commonly cultivated by the Greeks and Romans. Their modern\r\ndescendants do not sow it.[1842] There are no Sanskrit, Persian, or\r\nArabic names. I suggested formerly that the Hebrew word _kussemeth_\r\nmight apply to this species, but this hypothesis now seems to me\r\ndifficult to maintain.\r\n\r\nMarschall Bieberstein[1843] mentions _Triticum monococcum_, or a\r\nvariety of it, growing wild in the Crimea and the eastern Caucasus, but\r\nno botanist has confirmed this assertion. Steven,[1844] who lived in the\r\nCrimea, declares that he never saw the species except cultivated by the\r\nTartars. On the other hand, the plant which Balansa gathered in a wild\r\nstate near Mount Sipylus, in Anatolia, is _T. monococcum_, according to\r\nJ. Gay,[1845] who takes with this form _Triticum bœoticum_, Boissier,\r\nwhich grows wild in the plains of Bœotia[1846] and in Servia.[1847]\r\n\r\nAdmitting these facts, _T. monococcum_ is a native of Servia, Greece,\r\nand Asia Minor, and as the attempts to cross it with other spelts or\r\nwheats have not been successful, it is rightly termed a species in the\r\nLinnæan sense.\r\n\r\nThe separation of wheat with free grains from spelt must have taken\r\nplace before all history, perhaps before the beginning of agriculture.\r\nWheat must have appeared first in Asia, and then spelt, probably in\r\nEastern Europe and Anatolia. Lastly, among spelts _T. monococcum_ seems\r\nto be the most ancient form, from which the others have gradually\r\ndeveloped in several thousand years of cultivation and selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Two-rowed Barley+—_Hordeum distichon_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nBarley is among the most ancient of cultivated plants. As all its forms\r\nresemble each other in nature and uses, we must not expect to find in\r\nancient authors and in common names that precision which would enable us\r\nto recognize the species admitted by botanists. In many cases the name\r\nbarley has been taken in a vague or generic sense. This is a difficulty\r\nwhich we must take into account. For instance, the expression of the Old\r\nTestament, of Berosus, of Moses of Chorene, Pausanias, Marco Polo, and\r\nmore recently of Olivier, indicating “wild and cultivated barley” in a\r\ngiven country, prove nothing, because we do not know to which species\r\nthey refer. There is the same obscurity in China. Dr. Bretschneider\r\nsays[1848] that, according to a work published in the year A.D. 100, the\r\nChinese cultivated barley, but he does not specify the kind. At the\r\nextreme west of the old world the Guanchos also cultivated a barley, of\r\nwhich we know the name but not the species.\r\n\r\nThe common variety of the two-rowed barley, in which the husk remains\r\nattached to the ripened grain, has been found wild in Western Asia, in\r\nArabia Petrea,[1849] near Mount Sinai,[1850] in the ruins of\r\nPersepolis,[1851] near the Caspian Sea,[1852] between Lenkoran and Baku,\r\nin the desert of Chirvan and Awhasia, to the south of the\r\nCaucasus,[1853] and in Turcomania.[1854] No author mentions it in\r\nGreece, Egypt, or to the east of Persia. Willdenow[1855] indicates it at\r\nSamara, in the south-east of Russia; but more recent authors do not\r\nconfirm this. Its modern area is, therefore, from the Red Sea to the\r\nCaucasus and the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\nHence this barley should be one of the forms cultivated by Semitic and\r\nTuranian peoples. Yet it has not been found in Egyptian monuments. It\r\nseems that the Aryans must have known it, but I find no proof in\r\nvernacular names or in history.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus[1856] speaks of the two-rowed barley. The lake-dwellers of\r\nEastern Switzerland cultivated it before they possessed metals,[1857]\r\nbut the six-rowed barley was more common among them.\r\n\r\nThe variety in which the grain is bare at maturity (_H. distichon\r\nnudum_, Linnæus), which in France has all sorts of absurd names, _orge à\r\ncafé_, _orge du Pérou_ (coffee barley, Peruvian barley), has never been\r\nfound wild.\r\n\r\nThe fan-shaped barley (_Hordeum Zeocriton_, Linnæus) seems to me to be\r\na cultivated form of the two-rowed barley. It is not known in a wild\r\nstate, nor has it been found in Egyptian monuments, nor the\r\nlake-dwellings of Switzerland, Savoy, and Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Common Barley+—_Hordeum vulgare_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe common barley with four rows of grain is mentioned by\r\nTheophrastus,[1858] but it seems to have been less cultivated in\r\nantiquity than that with two rows, and considerably less than that with\r\nsix rows. It has not been found in Egyptian monuments, nor in the\r\nlake-dwellings of Switzerland, Savoy, and Italy.\r\n\r\nWilldenow[1859] says that it grows in Sicily and in the south-east of\r\nRussia, at Samara, but the modern floras of these two countries do not\r\nconfirm this. We do not know what species of barley it was that Olivier\r\nsaw growing wild in Mesopotamia; consequently the common barley has not\r\nyet been found certainly wild.\r\n\r\nThe multitude of common names which are attributed to it prove nothing\r\nas to its origin, for in most cases it is impossible to know if they are\r\nnames of barley in general, or of a particular kind of barley cultivated\r\nin a given country.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Six-rowed Barley+—_Hordeum hexastichon_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis was the species most commonly cultivated in antiquity. Not only is\r\nit mentioned by Greek authors, but it has also been found in the\r\nearliest Egyptian monuments,[1860] and in the remains of the\r\nlake-dwellings of Switzerland (age of stone), of Italy, and of Savoy\r\n(age of bronze).[1861] Heer has even distinguished two varieties of the\r\nspecies formerly cultivated in Switzerland. One of them answers to the\r\nsix-rowed barley represented on the medals of Metapontis, a town in the\r\nsouth of Italy, six centuries before Christ.\r\n\r\nAccording to Roxburgh,[1862] it was the only kind of barley grown in\r\nIndia at the end of the last century. He attributes to it the Sanskrit\r\nname _yuva_, which has become _juba_ in Bengali. Adolphe Pictet[1863]\r\nhas carefully studied the names in Sanskrit and other Indo-European\r\nlanguages which answer to the generic name barley, but he has not been\r\nable to go into the details of each species.\r\n\r\nThe six-rowed barley has not been seen in the conditions of a wild\r\nplant, of which the species has been determined by a botanist. I have\r\nnot found it in Boissier’s herbarium, which is so rich in Eastern\r\nplants. It is possible that the wild barleys mentioned by ancient\r\nauthors and by Olivier were _Hordeum hexastichon_, but there is no proof\r\nof this.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Barleys in general._\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the only form which is now found wild is the simplest,\r\nthe least productive, _Hordeum distichon_, which was, like _H.\r\nhexastichon_, cultivated in prehistoric time. Perhaps _H. vulgare_ has\r\nnot been so long in cultivation as the two others.\r\n\r\nTwo hypotheses may be drawn from these facts: 1. That the barleys with\r\nfour and six rows were, in prehistoric agriculture anterior to that of\r\nthe ancient Egyptians who built the monuments, derived from _H.\r\ndistichon_. 2. The barleys with six and four ranks were species formerly\r\nwild, extinct since the historical epoch. It would be strange in this\r\ncase that no trace of them has remained in the floras of the vast region\r\ncomprised between India, the Black Sea, and Abyssinia, where we are\r\nnearly sure of their cultivation, at least of that of the six-ranked\r\nbarley.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Rye+—_Secale cereale_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nRye has not been very long in cultivation, unless, perhaps, in Russia\r\nand Thrace. It has not been found in Egyptian monuments, and has no name\r\nin Semitic languages, even in the modern ones, nor in Sanskrit and the\r\nmodern Indian languages derived from Sanskrit. These facts agree with\r\nthe circumstance that rye thrives better in northern than in southern\r\ncountries, where it is not usually cultivated in modern times. Dr.\r\nBretschneider[1864] thinks it is unknown to Chinese agriculture. He\r\ndoubts the contrary assertion of a modern writer, and remarks that the\r\nname of a cereal mentioned in the memoirs of the Emperor Kanghi, which\r\nmay be supposed to be this species, signifies Russian wheat. Now rye, he\r\nsays, is much cultivated in Siberia. There is no mention of it in\r\nJapanese floras.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks did not know it. The first author who mentions it in\r\nthe Roman empire is Pliny,[1865] who speaks of the _secale_ cultivated\r\nat Turin at the foot of the Alps, under the name of _Asia_. Galen,[1866]\r\nborn in A.D. 131, had seen it cultivated in Thrace and Macedonia under\r\nthe name _briza_. Its cultivation does not seem ancient, at least in\r\nItaly, for no trace of rye has been found in the remains of the\r\nlake-dwellings of the north of that country, or of Switzerland and\r\nSavoy, even of the age of bronze. Jetteles found remains of rye near\r\nOlmutz, together with instruments of bronze, and Heer,[1867] who saw the\r\nspecimens, mentions others of the Roman epoch in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nFailing archæological proofs, European languages show an early knowledge\r\nof rye in German, Keltic, and Slavonic countries. The principal names,\r\naccording to Adolphe Pictet,[1868] belong to the peoples of the north of\r\nEurope: Anglo-Saxon, _ryge_, _rig_; Scandinavian, _rûgr_; Old High\r\nGerman, _roggo_; Ancient Slav, _ruji_, _roji_; Polish, _rez_; Illyrian,\r\n_raz_, etc. The origin of this name must date, he says, from an epoch\r\nprevious to the separation of the Teutons from the Lithuano-Slavs. The\r\nword _secale_ of the Latins recurs in a similar form among the Bretons,\r\n_segal_, and the Basques, _cekela_, _zekhalea_; but it is not known\r\nwhether the Latins borrowed it from the Gauls and Iberians, or whether,\r\nconversely, the latter took the name from the Romans. This second\r\nhypothesis appears to be the more probable of the two, since the\r\nCisalpine Gauls of Pliny’s time had quite a different name. I also find\r\nmentioned a Tartar name, _aresch_,[1869] and an Ossete name, _syl_,\r\n_sil_,[1870] which points to an ancient cultivation to the east of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThus historical and philological data show that the species probably had\r\nits origin in the countries north of the Danube, and that its\r\ncultivation is hardly earlier than the Christian era in the Roman\r\nempire, but perhaps more ancient in Russia and Tartary.\r\n\r\nThe indication of wild rye given by several authors should scarcely ever\r\nbe accepted, for it has often happened that _Secale cereale_ has been\r\nconfounded with perennial species, or with others of which the ear is\r\neasily broken, which modern botanists have rightly distinguished.[1871]\r\nMany mistakes which thus arose have been cleared up by an examination of\r\noriginal specimens. Others may be suspected. Thus I do not know what to\r\nthink of the assertions of L. Ross, who said he had found rye growing\r\nwild in several parts of Anatolia,[1872] and of the Russian traveller\r\nSsaewerzoff, who said he saw it in Turkestan.[1873] The latter fact is\r\nprobable enough, but it is not said that any botanist verified the\r\nspecies. Kunth[1874] had previously mentioned it in “the desert between\r\nthe Black Sea and the Caspian,” but he does not say on what authority of\r\ntraveller or of specimens. Boissier’s herbarium has shown me no wild\r\n_Secale cereale_, but it has persuaded me that another species of rye\r\nmight easily be mistaken for this one, and that assertions require to be\r\ncarefully verified.\r\n\r\nFailing satisfactory proofs of wild plants, I formerly urged, in my\r\n_Géographie Botanique Raisonnée_, an argument of some value. _Secale\r\ncereale_ sows itself from cultivation, and becomes almost wild in parts\r\nof the Austrian empire,[1875] which is seldom seen elsewhere.[1876] Thus\r\nin the east of Europe, where history points to an ancient cultivation,\r\nrye finds at the present day the most favourable conditions for living\r\nwithout the aid of man. It can hardly be doubted, from these facts, that\r\nits original area was in the region comprised between the Austrian Alps\r\nand the north of the Caspian Sea. This seems the more probable that the\r\nfive or six known species of the genus _Secale_ inhabit western\r\ntemperate Asia or the south-east of Europe.\r\n\r\nAdmitting this origin, the Aryan natives would not have known the\r\nspecies, as philology already shows us; but in their migrations westward\r\nthey must have met with it under different names, which they transported\r\nhere and there.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Common Oats+ and +Eastern Oats+—_Avena sativa_, Linnæus; _Avena\r\norientalis_, Schreber.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians and the Hebrews did not cultivate oats, but they\r\nare now grown in Egypt.[1877] There is no Sanskrit name, nor any in\r\nmodern Indian languages. They are only now and then planted by the\r\nEnglish in India for their horses.[1878] The earliest mention of oats in\r\nChina is in an historical work on the period 618 to 907 A.D.; it refers\r\nto the variety known to botanists as _Avena sativa nuda_.[1879] The\r\nancient Greeks knew the genus very well; they called it _bromos_,[1880]\r\nas the Latins called it _avena_; but these names were commonly applied\r\nto species which are not cultivated, and which are weeds mixed with\r\ncereals. There is no proof that they cultivated the common oats. Pliny’s\r\nremark[1881] that the Germans lived on oatmeal, implies that the species\r\nwas not cultivated by the Romans.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of oats was, therefore, practised anciently to the\r\nnorth of Italy and of Greece. It was diffused later and partially in the\r\nsouth of the Roman empire. It is possible that it was more ancient in\r\nAsia Minor, for Galen[1882] says that oats were abundant in Mysia, above\r\nPergamus; that they were given to horses, and that men used them for\r\nfood in years of scarcity. A colony of Gauls had formerly penetrated\r\ninto Asia Minor. Oats have been found among the remains of the Swiss\r\nlake-dwellings of the age of bronze,[1883] and in Germany, near\r\nWittenburg, in several tombs of the first centuries of the Christian\r\nera, or a little earlier.[1884] Hitherto none have been found in the\r\nlake-dwellings of the north of Italy, which confirms the belief that\r\noats were not cultivated in Italy in the time of the Roman republic.\r\n\r\nThe vernacular names also prove an ancient existence north and west of\r\nthe Alps, and on the borders of Europe towards Tartary and the Caucasus.\r\nThe most widely diffused of these names is indicated by the Latin\r\n_avena_, Ancient Slav _ovisu_, _ovesu_, _ovsa_, Russian _ovesu_,\r\nLithuanian _awiza_, Lettonian _ausas_, Ostias _abis_.[1885] The English\r\nword _oats_ comes, according to A. Pictet, from the Anglo-Saxon _ata_ or\r\n_ate_. The Basque name, _olba_ or _oloa_,[1886] argues a very ancient\r\nIberian cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe Keltic names are quite different:[1887] Irish _coirce_, _cuirce_,\r\n_corca_, Armorican _kerch_. Tartar _sulu_, Georgian _kari_, Hungarian\r\n_zab_, Croat _zob_, Esthonian _kaer_, and others are mentioned by\r\nNemnich[1888] as applying to the generic name oats, but it is not likely\r\nthat names so varied do not belong to a cultivated species. It is\r\nstrange that there should be an independent Berber name _zekkoum_,[1889]\r\nas there is nothing to show that the species was anciently cultivated in\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nAll these facts show how erroneous is the opinion which reigned in the\r\nlast century,[1890] that oats were brought originally from the island of\r\nJuan Fernandez, a belief which came apparently from an assertion of the\r\nnavigator Anson.[1891] It is evidently not in the Austral hemisphere\r\nthat we must seek for the home of the species, but in those countries of\r\nthe northern hemisphere where it was anciently cultivated.\r\n\r\nOats sow themselves on rubbish-heaps, by the wayside, and near\r\ncultivated ground more easily than other cereals, and sometimes persist\r\nin such a way as to appear wild. This has been observed in widely\r\nseparate places, as Algeria and Japan, Paris and the north of\r\nChina.[1892] Instances of this nature render us sceptical as to the wild\r\nnature of the oats which Bové said he found in the desert of Sinai. It\r\nhas also been said[1893] that the traveller Olivier saw oats wild in\r\nPersia, but he does not mention the fact in his work. Besides, several\r\nannual species nearly resembling oats may deceive the traveller. I\r\ncannot discover either in books or herbaria the existence of really wild\r\noats either in Europe or Asia, and Bentham has assured me that there are\r\nno such specimens in the herbarium at Kew; but certainly the half-wild\r\nor naturalized condition is more frequent in the Austrian states from\r\nDalmatia to Transylvania[1894] than elsewhere. This is an indication of\r\norigin which may be added to the historical and philological arguments\r\nin favour of eastern temperate Europe.\r\n\r\n_Avena strigosa_, Schreber, appears to be a variety of the common oats,\r\njudging from the experiments in cultivation mentioned by Bentham, who\r\nadds, it is true, that these need confirmation.[1895] There is a good\r\ndrawing of the variety in Host, _Icones Graminum Austriacorum_, ii. pl.\r\n56, which may be compared with _A. sativa_, pl. 59. For the rest, _Avena\r\nstrigosa_ has not been found wild. It exists in Europe in deserted\r\nfields, which confirms the hypothesis that it is a form derived by\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n_Avena orientalis_, Schreber, of which the spikelets lean all to one\r\nside, has also been grown in Europe from the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. It is not known in a wild state. Often mixed with common oats,\r\nit is not to be distinguished from them at a glance. The names it bears\r\nin Germany, Turkish or Hungarian oats, points to a modern introduction\r\nfrom the East. Host gives a good drawing of it (_Gram. Austr._, i. pl.\r\n44).\r\n\r\nAs all the varieties of oats are cultivated, and none have been\r\ndiscovered in a truly wild state, it is very probable that they are all\r\nderived from a single prehistoric form, a native of eastern temperate\r\nEurope and of Tartary.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Common Millet+—_Panicum miliaceum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this plant is prehistoric in the south of Europe, in\r\nEgypt, and in Asia. The Greeks knew it by the name _kegchros_, and the\r\nLatins by that of _milium_.[1896] The Swiss lake-dwellers of the age of\r\nstone made great use of millet,[1897] and it has also been found in the\r\nremains of the lake-dwellings of Varese in Italy.[1898] As we do not\r\nelsewhere find specimens of these early times, it is impossible to know\r\nwhat was the _panicum_ or the _sorghum_ mentioned by Latin authors which\r\nwas used as food by the inhabitants of Gaul, Panonia, and other\r\ncountries. Unger[1899] counts _P. miliaceum_ among the species of\r\nancient Egypt, but it does not appear that he had positive proof of\r\nthis, for he has mentioned no monument, drawing, or seed found in the\r\ntombs. Nor is there any material proof of ancient cultivation in\r\nMesopotamia, India, and China. For the last-named country it is a\r\nquestion whether the _shu_, one of the five cereals sown by the emperors\r\nin the great yearly ceremony, is _Panicum miliaceum_, an allied species,\r\nor sorghum; but it appears that the sense of the word _shu_ has changed,\r\nand that formerly it was perhaps sorghum which was sown.[1900]\r\n\r\nAnglo-Indian botanists[1901] attribute two Sanskrit names to the modern\r\nspecies, _ûnû_ and _vreehib-heda_, although the modern Hindu and Bengali\r\nname _cheena_ and the Telinga name _worga_ are quite different. If the\r\nSanskrit names are genuine, they indicate an ancient cultivation in\r\nIndia. No Hebrew nor Berber name is known,[1902] but there are Arab\r\nnames, _dokhn_, used in Egypt, and _kosjæjb_ in Arabia.[1903] There are\r\nvarious European names. Besides the Greek and Latin words, there is an\r\nancient Slav name, _proso_,[1904] retained in Russia and Poland, an old\r\nGerman word _hirsi_, and a Lithuanian name _sora_.[1905] The absence of\r\nKeltic names is remarkable. It appears that the species was cultivated\r\nespecially in Eastern Europe, and spread westward towards the end of the\r\nGallic dominion.\r\n\r\nWith regard to its wild existence, Linnæus says[1906] that it inhabits\r\nIndia, and most authors repeat this; but Anglo-Indian botanists[1907]\r\nalways give it as cultivated. It is not found in Japanese floras. In the\r\nnorth of China de Bunge only saw it cultivated,[1908] and Maximowicz\r\nnear the Ussuri, on the borders of fields and in places near Chinese\r\ndwellings.[1909] Ledebour says[1910] it is nearly wild in Altaic Siberia\r\nand Central Russia, and wild south of the Caucasus and in the country of\r\nTalysch. He quotes Hohenacker for the last-named locality, who, however,\r\nsays only “nearly wild.”[1911] In the Crimea, where it furnishes bread\r\nfor the Tartars, it is found here and there nearly wild,[1912] which is\r\nalso the case in the south of France, in Italy, and in Austria.[1913] It\r\nis not wild in Greece,[1914] and no one has found it in Persia or in\r\nSyria. Forskal and Delile indicated it in Egypt, but Ascherson does not\r\nadmit this;[1915] and Forskal gives it in Arabia.[1916] The species may\r\nhave become naturalized in these regions, as the result of frequent\r\ncultivation from the time of the ancient Egyptians. However, its wild\r\nnature is so doubtful elsewhere, that its Egypto-Arabian origin is very\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Italian Millet+—_Panicum Italicum_, Linnæus; _Setaria Italica_,\r\nBeauvois.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this species was very common in the temperate parts\r\nof the old world in prehistoric times. Its seeds served as food for man,\r\nthough now they are chiefly given to birds.\r\n\r\nIn China it is one of the five plants which the emperor sows each year\r\nin a public ceremony, according to the command issued by Chin-nong 2700\r\nB.C.[1917] The common name is _siao mi_ (little seed), the more ancient\r\nname being _ku_; but the latter seems to be applied also to a very\r\ndifferent species.[1918] Pickering says he recognized it in two ancient\r\nEgyptian drawings, and that it is now cultivated in Egypt[1919] under\r\nthe name _dokhn_; but that is the name of _Panicum miliaceum_. It is,\r\ntherefore, very doubtful that the ancient Egyptians cultivated it. It\r\nhas been found among the remains of the Swiss lake-dwellings of the\r\nstone epoch, and therefore _à fortiori_ among the lake-dwellers of the\r\nsubsequent epoch in Savoy.[1920]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks and Latins did not mention it, or at least it has not\r\nbeen possible to certify it from what they say of several panicums and\r\nmillets. In our own day the species is rarely cultivated in the south of\r\nEurope, not at all in Greece,[1921] for instance, and I do not find it\r\nindicated in Egypt, but it is common in Southern Asia.[1922]\r\n\r\nThe Sanskrit names _kungû_ and _priyungû_, of which the first is\r\nretained in Bengali,[1923] are attributed to this species. Piddington\r\nmentions several other names in Indian languages in his _Index_.\r\nAinslie[1924] gives a Persian name, _arzun_, and an Arabic name; but the\r\nlatter is commonly attributed to _Panicum miliaceum_. There is no Hebrew\r\nname, and the plant is not mentioned in botanical works upon Egypt and\r\nArabia. The European names have no historical value. They are not\r\noriginal, and commonly refer to the transmission of the species or to\r\nits cultivation in a given country. The specific name, _italicum_, is an\r\nabsurd example, the plant being rarely cultivated and never wild in\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nRumphius says it is wild in the Sunda Isles, but not very\r\npositively.[1925] Linnæus probably started from this basis to exaggerate\r\nand even promulgate an error, saying, “inhabits the Indies.”[1926] It\r\ncertainly does not come from the West Indies; and further, Roxburgh\r\nasserts that he never saw it wild in India. The Graminæ have not yet\r\nappeared in Sir Joseph Hookers flora; but Aitchison[1927] gives the\r\nspecies as only cultivated in the north-west of India. The Australian\r\nplant which Robert Brown said belonged to this species belongs to\r\nanother.[1928] _P. italicum_ appears to be wild in Japan, at least in\r\nthe form called _germanica_ by different authors,[1929] and the Chinese\r\nconsider the five cereals of the annual ceremony to be natives of their\r\ncountry. Yet Bunge, in the north of China, and Maximowicz in the basin\r\nof the river Amur, only saw the species cultivated on a large scale, in\r\nthe form of the _germanica_ variety.[1930] In Persia,[1931] the Caucasus\r\nMountains, and Europe, I only find in floras the plant indicated as\r\ncultivated, or escaped sometimes from cultivation on rubbish-heaps,\r\nwaysides, waste ground, etc.[1932]\r\n\r\nThe sum of the historical, philological, and botanical data make me\r\nthink that the species existed before all cultivation, thousands of\r\nyears ago in China, Japan, and in the Indian Archipelago. Its\r\ncultivation must have early spread towards the West, since we know of\r\nSanskrit names, but it does not seem to have been known in Syria,\r\nArabia, and Greece, and it is probably through Russia and Austria that\r\nit early arrived among the lake-dwellers of the stone age in\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Common Sorghum+—_Holcus sorghum_, Linnæus; _Andropogon sorghum_,\r\nBrotero; _Sorghum vulgare_, Persoon.\r\n\r\nBotanists are not agreed as to the distinction of several of the species\r\nof sorghum, and even as to the genera into which this group of the\r\nGraminæ should be divided. A good monograph on the sorghums is needed,\r\nas in the case of the panicums. In the mean time I will give some\r\ninformation on the principal species, because of their immense\r\nimportance as food for man, rearing of poultry, and as fodder for\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nWe may take as a typical species the sorghum cultivated in Europe, as it\r\nis figured by Host in his _Graminœ Austriacœ_ (iv. pi. 2). It is one of\r\nthe plants most commonly cultivated by the modern Egyptians, under the\r\nname of _dourra_, and also in equatorial Africa, India, and China.[1933]\r\nIt is so productive in hot countries that it is a staple food of\r\nimmense populations in the old world.\r\n\r\nLinnæus and all authors, even our contemporaries, say that it is of\r\nIndian origin; but in the first edition of Roxburgh’s flora, published\r\nin 1820, this botanist, who should have been consulted, asserts that he\r\nhad only seen it cultivated. He makes the same remark for the allied\r\nforms (_bicolor_, _saccharatus_, etc.), which are often regarded as mere\r\nvarieties. Aitchison also had only seen the sorghum cultivated. The\r\nabsence of a Sanskrit name also renders the Indian origin very doubtful.\r\nBretschneider, on the other hand, says the sorghum is indigenous in\r\nChina, although he says that ancient Chinese authors have not spoken of\r\nit. It is true that he quotes a name, common at Pekin, _kao-liang_ (tall\r\nmillet), which also applies to _Holcus saccharatus_, and to which it is\r\nbetter suited.\r\n\r\nThe sorghum has not been found among the remains of the lake-dwellings\r\nof Switzerland and Italy. The Greeks never spoke of it. Pliny’s\r\nphrase[1934] about a _milium_ introduced into Italy from India in his\r\ntime has been supposed to refer to the sorghum; but it was a taller\r\nplant, perhaps _Holcus saccharatus_. The sorghum has not been found in a\r\nnatural state in the tombs of ancient Egypt. Dr. Hannerd thought he\r\nrecognized it in some crushed seeds brought by Rosellini from\r\nThebes;[1935] but Mr. Birch, the keeper of Egyptian antiquities in the\r\nBritish Museum, has more recently declared that the species has not been\r\nfound in the ancient tombs.[1936] Pickering says he recognized its\r\nleaves mixed with those of the papyrus. He says he also saw paintings of\r\nit; and Leipsius has copies of drawings which he, as well as Unger and\r\nWilkinson, takes to be the _dourra_ of modern cultivation.[1937] The\r\nheight and the form of the ear are undoubtedly those of the sorghum. It\r\nis possible that this species is the _dochan_, once mentioned in the Old\r\nTestament[1938] as a cereal from which bread was made; yet the modern\r\nArabic word _dokhn_ refers to the sweet sorghum.\r\n\r\nCommon names tell us nothing, either from their lack of meaning, or\r\nbecause in many cases the same name has been applied to the different\r\nkinds of panicum and sorghum. I can find none which is certain in the\r\nancient languages of India or Western Asia, which argues an introduction\r\nof but few centuries before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nNo botanist mentions the _dourra_ as wild in Egypt or in Arabia. An\r\nanalogous form is wild in equatorial Africa, but R. Brown has not been\r\nable to identify it,[1939] and the flora of tropical Africa in course of\r\npublication at Kew has not yet reached the order Graminæ. There remains,\r\ntherefore, the single assertion of Dr. Bretschneider, that the tall\r\nsorghum is indigenous in China. If it is really the species in question,\r\nit spread westward very late. But it was known to the ancient Egyptians,\r\nand how could they have received it from China while it remained unknown\r\nto the intermediate peoples? It is easier to understand that it is\r\nindigenous in tropical Africa, and was introduced into Egypt in\r\nprehistoric time, afterwards into India, and finally into China, where\r\nits cultivation does not seem to be very ancient, for the first work\r\nwhich mentions it belongs to the fourth century of our era.\r\n\r\nIn support of the theory of African origin, I may quote the observation\r\nof Schmidt,[1940] that the species abounds in the island of San Antonio,\r\nin the Cape Verde group, in rocky places. He believes it to be\r\n“completely naturalized,” which perhaps conceals a true origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Sweet Sorghum+—_Holcus saccharatus_, Linnæus; _Andropogon saccharatus_,\r\nRoxburgh; _Sorghum saccharatum_, Persoon.\r\n\r\nThis species, taller than the common sorghum and with a loose\r\npanicle,[1941] is cultivated in tropical countries for the seed—which,\r\nhowever, is not so good as that of the common sorghum—and in less hot\r\ncountries as fodder, or even for the sugar which the stem contains in\r\nconsiderable quantities. The Chinese extract a spirit from it, but not\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of botanists and of the public in general is that it comes\r\nfrom India; but Roxburgh says that it is only cultivated in that\r\ncountry. It is the same in the Sunda Isles, where the _battari_ is\r\ncertainly this species. It is the _kao-liang_, or great millet of the\r\nChinese. It is not said to be indigenous in China, nor is it mentioned\r\nby Chinese authors who lived before the Christian era.[1942] From these\r\nfacts, and the absence of any Sanskrit name, the Asiatic origin seems to\r\nme a delusion.\r\n\r\nThe plant is now cultivated in Egypt less than the common sorghum, and\r\nin Arabia under the name _dokhna_ or _dokhn_.[1943] No botanist has seen\r\nit wild in these countries. There is no proof that the ancient Egyptians\r\ncultivated it. Herodotus[1944] spoke of a “tree-millet” in the plains of\r\nAssyria. It might be the species in question, but it is not possible to\r\nprove it.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks and Romans were not acquainted with it, not at least before\r\nthe Roman empire, but it is possible that this was the millet, seven\r\nfeet high, which Pliny mentions[1945] as having been introduced from\r\nIndia in his lifetime.\r\n\r\nWe must probably seek its origin in tropical Africa, where the species\r\nis generally cultivated. Sir William Hooker[1946] mentions specimens\r\nfrom the banks of the river Nun, which were perhaps wild. The\r\napproaching publication of the Graminæ in the flora of tropical Africa\r\nwill probably throw some light on this question. The spread of its\r\ncultivation from the interior of Africa to Egypt after the Pharaohs, to\r\nArabia, the Indian Archipelago, and, after the epoch of Sanskrit, to\r\nIndia, lastly to China, towards the beginning of our era, tallies with\r\nhistorical data, and is not difficult to admit. The inverse hypothesis\r\nof a transmission from east to west presents a number of objections.\r\n\r\nSeveral varieties of sorghum are cultivated in Asia and in Africa; for\r\ninstance, _cernuus_ with drooping panicles, mentioned by Roxburgh, and\r\nwhich Prosper Alpin had seen in Egypt; _bicolor_, which in height\r\nresembles the _saccharatus_; and _niger_ and _rubens_, which also seem\r\nto be varieties of cultivation. None of these has been found wild, and\r\nit is probable that a monograph would connect them with one or other of\r\nthe above-mentioned species.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Coracan+—_Eleusine coracana_, Gærtner.\r\n\r\nThis annual grass, which resembles the millets, is cultivated especially\r\nin India and the Malay Archipelago. It is also grown in Egypt[1947] and\r\nin Abyssinia;[1948] but the silence of many botanists, who have\r\nmentioned the plants of the interior and west of Africa, shows that its\r\ncultivation is not widely spread on that continent. In Japan[1949] it\r\nsometimes escapes from cultivation. The seeds will ripen in the south of\r\nEurope, but the plant is valueless there except as fodder.[1950]\r\n\r\nNo author mentions having found it in a wild state in Asia or in Africa.\r\nRoxburgh,[1951] who is attentive to such matters, after speaking of its\r\ncultivation, adds, “I never saw it wild.” He distinguishes under the\r\nname _Eleusine stricta_ a form even more commonly cultivated in India,\r\nwhich appears to be simply a variety of _E. coracana_, and which also he\r\nhas not found uncultivated.\r\n\r\nWe shall discover its country by other means.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the species of the genus _Eleusine_ are more\r\nnumerous in the south of Asia than in other tropical regions. Besides\r\nthe cultivated plant, Royle[1952] mentions other species, of which the\r\npoorer natives of India gather the seeds in the plains. According to\r\nPiddington’s _Index_, there is a Sanskrit name, _rajika_, and several\r\nother names in the modern languages of India. That of _coracana_ comes\r\nfrom an old name used in Ceylon, _kourakhan_.[1953] In the Malay\r\nArchipelago the names appear less numerous and less original.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt the cultivation of this species is perhaps not very ancient.\r\nThe monuments of antiquity bear no trace of it. Græco-Roman authors who\r\nknew the country did not speak of it, nor later Prosper Alpin, Forskal,\r\nand Delile. We must refer to a modern work, that of Schweinfurth and\r\nAscherson, to find mention of the species, and I cannot even discover an\r\nArab name.[1954] Thus botany, history, and philology point to an Indian\r\norigin. The flora of British India, in which the Graminæ have not yet\r\nappeared, will perhaps tell us the plant has been found wild in recent\r\nexplorations.\r\n\r\nA nearly allied species is grown in Abyssinia, _Eleusine Tocussa_,\r\nFresenius,[1955] a plant very little known, which is perhaps a native of\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Rice+—_Oryza sativa_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nIn the ceremony instituted by the Chinese Emperor Chin-nong, 2800 years\r\nB.C., rice plays the principal part. The reigning emperor must himself\r\nsow it, whereas the four other species are or may be sown by the princes\r\nof his family.[1956] The five species are considered by the Chinese as\r\nindigenous, and it must be admitted that this is probably the case with\r\nrice, which is in general use, and has been so for a long time; in a\r\ncountry intersected by canals and rivers, and hence peculiarly\r\nfavourable to aquatic plants. Botanists have not sufficiently studied\r\nChinese plants for us to know whether rice is often found outside\r\ncultivated ground; but Loureiro[1957] had seen it in marshes in\r\nCochin-China.\r\n\r\nRumphius and modern writers upon the Malay Archipelago give it only as a\r\ncultivated plant. The multitude of names and varieties points to a very\r\nancient cultivation. In British India it dates at least from the Aryan\r\ninvasion, for rice has Sanskrit names, _vrihi_, _arunya_[1958] whence\r\ncome, probably, several names in modern Indian languages, and _oruza_ or\r\n_oruzon_ of the ancient Greeks, _rouz_ or _arous_ of the Arabs.\r\nTheophrastus[1959] mentioned rice as cultivated in India. The Greeks\r\nbecame acquainted with it through Alexander’s expedition. “According to\r\nAristobulus,” says Strabo,[1960] “rice grows in Bactriana, Babylonia,\r\nSusida;” and he adds, “we may also add in Lower Syria.” Further on he\r\nnotes that the Indians use it for food, and extract a spirit from it.\r\nThese assertions, doubtful perhaps for Bactriana, show that this\r\ncultivation was firmly established, at least, from the time of Alexander\r\n(400 B.C.), in the Euphrates valley, and from the beginning of our era\r\nin the hot and irrigated districts of Syria. The Old Testament does not\r\nmention rice, but a careful and judicious writer, Reynier,[1961] has\r\nremarked several passages in the Talmud which relate to its cultivation.\r\nThese facts lead us to suppose that the Indians employed rice after the\r\nChinese, and that it spread still later towards the Euphrates—earlier,\r\nhowever, than the Aryan invasion into India. A thousand years elapsed\r\nbetween the existence of this cultivation in Babylonia and its\r\ntransportation into Syria, whence its introduction into Egypt after an\r\ninterval of probably two or three centuries. There is no trace of rice\r\namong the grains or paintings of ancient Egypt.[1962] Strabo, who had\r\nvisited this country as well as Syria, does not say that rice was\r\ncultivated in Egypt in his time, but that the Garamantes[1963] grew it,\r\nand this people is believed to have inhabited an oasis to the south of\r\nCarthage. It is possible that they received it from Syria. At all\r\nevents, Egypt could not long fail to possess a crop so well suited to\r\nits peculiar conditions of irrigation. The Arabs introduced the species\r\ninto Spain, as we see from the Spanish name _arroz_. Rice was first\r\ncultivated in Italy in 1468, near Pisa.[1964] It is of recent\r\nintroduction into Louisiana.\r\n\r\nWhen I said that the cultivation of rice in India was probably more\r\nrecent than in China, I did not mean that the plant was not wild there.\r\nIt belongs to a family of which the species cover wide areas, and,\r\nbesides, aquatic plants have commonly more extensive habitations than\r\nothers. Rice existed, perhaps, before all cultivation in Southern Asia\r\nfrom China to Bengal, as is shown by the variety of names in the\r\nmonosyllabic languages of the races between India and China.[1965] It\r\nhas been found outside cultivation in several Indian localities,\r\naccording to Roxburgh.[1966] He says that wild rice, called _newaree_ by\r\nthe Telingas, grows in abundance on the shores of lakes in the country\r\nof the Circars. Its grain is prized by rich Hindus, but it is not\r\nplanted because it is not very productive. Roxburgh has no doubt that\r\nthis is the original plant. Thomson[1967] found wild rice at Moradabad,\r\nin the province of Delhi. Historical reasons support the idea that these\r\nspecimens are indigenous. Otherwise they might be supposed to be the\r\nresult of the habitual cultivation of the species, all the more that\r\nthere are examples of the facility with which rice sows itself and\r\nbecomes naturalized in warm, damp climates.[1968] In any case historical\r\nevidence and botanical probability tend to the belief that rice existed\r\nin India before cultivation.[1969]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Maize+—_Zea mays_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\n“Maize is of American origin, and has only been introduced into the old\r\nworld since the discovery of the new. I consider these two assertions\r\nas positive, in spite of the contrary opinion of some authors, and the\r\ndoubts of the celebrated agriculturist Bonafous, to whom we are indebted\r\nfor the most complete treatise upon maize.”[1970] I used these words in\r\n1855, after having already contested the opinion of Bonafous at the time\r\nof the publication of his work.[1971] The proofs of an American origin\r\nhave been since reinforced. Yet attempts have been made to prove the\r\ncontrary, and as the French name, _blé de Turquie_, gives currency to an\r\nerror, it is as well to resume the discussion with new data.\r\n\r\nNo one denies that maize was unknown in Europe at the time of the Roman\r\nempire, but it has been said that it was brought from the East in the\r\nMiddle Ages. The principal argument is based upon a charter of the\r\nthirteenth century, published by Molinari,[1972] according to which two\r\ncrusaders, companions in arms of Boniface III., Marquis of Monferrat,\r\ngave in 1204 to the town of Incisa a piece of the true cross ... and a\r\npurse containing a kind of seed of a golden colour and partly white,\r\nunknown in the country and brought from Anatolia, where it was called\r\n_meliga_. etc. The historian of the crusades, Michaux, and later Daru\r\nand Sismondi, said a great deal about this charter; but the botanist\r\nDelile, as well as Targionitozzetti and Bonafous himself, thought that\r\nthe seed in question might belong to some sorghum and not to maize.\r\nThese old discussions have been rendered absurd by the Comte de Riant’s\r\ndiscovery[1973] that the charter of Incisa is the fabrication of a\r\nmodern impostor. I quote this instance to show how scholars who are not\r\nnaturalists may make mistakes in the interpretation of the names of\r\nplants, and also how dangerous it is to rely upon an isolated proof in\r\nhistorical questions.\r\n\r\nThe names _blé de Turquie_, Turkish wheat (Indian corn), given to maize\r\nin almost all modern European languages no more prove an Eastern origin\r\nthan the charter of Incisa. These names are as erroneous as that of _coq\r\nd’Inde_, in English _turkey_, given to an American bird. Maize is called\r\nin Lorraine and in the Vosges Roman corn; in Tuscany, Sicilian corn; in\r\nSicily, Indian corn; in the Pyrenees, Spanish corn; in Provence, Barbary\r\nor Guinea corn. The Turks call it Egyptian corn, and the Egyptians,\r\nSyrian _dourra_. This last case proves at least that it is neither\r\nEgyptian nor Syrian. The widespread name of Turkish wheat dates from the\r\nsixteenth century. It sprang from an error as to the origin of the\r\nplant, which was fostered perhaps by the tufts which terminate the ears\r\nof maize, which were compared to the beard of the Turks, or by the\r\nvigour of the plant, which may have given rise to an expression similar\r\nto the French _fort comme un turc_. The first botanist who uses the\r\nname, Turkish wheat, is Ruellius, in 1536.[1974] Bock or Tragus,[1975]\r\nin 1552, after giving a drawing of the species which he calls _Frumentum\r\nturcicum_, _Welschkorn_, in Germany, having learnt by merchants that it\r\ncame from India, conceived the unfortunate idea that it was a certain\r\n_typha_ of Bactriana, to which ancient authors alluded in vague terms.\r\nDodoens in 1583, Camerarius in 1588, and Matthiole[1976] rectified these\r\nerrors, and positively asserted the American origin. They adopted the\r\nname _mays_, which they knew to be American. We have seen (p. 363) that\r\nthe zea of the Greeks was a spelt. Certainly the ancients did not know\r\nmaize. The first travellers[1977] who described the productions of the\r\nnew world were surprised at it, a clear proof that they had not known it\r\nin Europe. Hernandez,[1978] who left Europe in 1571, according to some\r\nauthorities, in 1593 according to others,[1979] did not know that from\r\nthe year 1500 maize had been sent to Seville for cultivation. This fact,\r\nattested by Fée, who has seen the municipal records,[1980] clearly shows\r\nthe American origin, which caused Hernandez to think the name of Turkish\r\nwheat a very bad one.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be urged that maize, new to Europe in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, existed in some parts of Asia or Africa before the discovery of\r\nAmerica. Let us see what truth there may be in this.\r\n\r\nThe famous orientalist D’Herbelot[1981] had accumulated several errors\r\npointed out by Bonafous and by me, on the subject of a passage in the\r\nPersian historian Mirkoud of the fifteenth century, about a cereal which\r\nRous, son of Japhet, sowed upon the shores of the Caspian Sea, and which\r\nhe takes to be the Indian corn of our day. It is hardly worth\r\nconsidering these assertions of a scholar to whom it had never occurred\r\nto consult the works of the botanists of his own day, or earlier. What\r\nis more important is the total silence on the subject of maize of the\r\ntravellers who visited Asia and Africa before the discovery of America;\r\nalso the absence of Hebrew and Sanskrit names for this plant; and\r\nlastly, that Egyptian monuments present no specimen or drawing of\r\nit.[1982] Rifaud, it is true, found an ear of maize in a sarcophagus at\r\nThebes, but it is believed to have been the trick of an Arab impostor.\r\nIf maize had existed in ancient Egypt, it would be seen in all\r\nmonuments, and would have been connected with religious ideas like all\r\nother remarkable plants. A species so easy of cultivation would have\r\nspread into all neighbouring countries. Its cultivation would not have\r\nbeen abandoned; and we find, on the contrary, that Prosper Alpin,\r\nvisiting Egypt in 1592, does not speak of it, and that Forskal,[1983]\r\nat the end of the eighteenth century, mentioned maize as still but\r\nlittle grown in Egypt, where it had no name distinct from the sorghums.\r\nEbn Baithar, an Arab physician of the thirteenth century, who had\r\ntravelled through the countries lying between Spain and Persia,\r\nindicates no plant which can be supposed to be maize.\r\n\r\nJ. Crawfurd,[1984] having seen maize generally cultivated in the Malay\r\nArchipelago under a name _jarung_, which appears to be indigenous,\r\nbelieved that the species was a native of these islands. But then how is\r\nit Rumphius makes no mention of it. The silence of this author points to\r\nan introduction later than the seventeenth century. Maize was so little\r\ndiffused on the continent of India in the last century, that\r\nRoxburgh[1985] wrote in his flora, which was published long after it was\r\ndrawn up, “Cultivated in different parts of India in gardens, and only\r\nas an ornament, but nowhere on the continent of India as an object of\r\ncultivation on a large scale.” We have seen that there is no Sanskrit\r\nname.\r\n\r\nMaize is frequently cultivated in China in modern times, and\r\nparticularly round Pekin for several generations,[1986] although most\r\ntravellers of the last century make no mention of it. Dr. Bretschneider,\r\nin his work published in 1870, does not hesitate to say that maize is\r\nnot indigenous in China; but some words in his letter of 1881 make me\r\nthink that he now attributes some importance to an ancient Chinese\r\nauthor, of whom Bonafous and afterwards Hance and Mayers have said a\r\ngreat deal. This is a work by Li-chi-tchin, entitled\r\n_Phen-thsao-kang-mou_, or _Pên-tsao-kung-mu_, a species of treatise on\r\nnatural history, which Bretschneider[1987] says was written at the end\r\nof the sixteenth century. Bonafous says it was concluded in 1578, and\r\nthe edition which he had seen in the Huzard library was of 1637. It\r\ncontains a drawing of maize with the Chinese character. This plate is\r\ncopied in Bonafous’ work, at the beginning of the chapter on the\r\noriginal country of the maize. It is clear that it represents the plant.\r\nDr. Hance[1988] appears to have based his arguments upon the researches\r\nof Mayers, who says that early Chinese authors assert that maize was\r\nimported from Sifan (Lower Mongolia, to the west of China) long before\r\nthe end of the fifteenth century, at an unknown date. The article\r\ncontains a copy of the drawing in the _Pên-tsao-kung-mu_, to which he\r\nassigns the date 1597.\r\n\r\nThe importation through Mongolia is improbable to such a degree that it\r\nis hardly worth speaking of it, and as for the principal assertion of\r\nthe Chinese author, the dates are uncertain and late. The work was\r\nfinished in 1578 according to Bonafous, in 1597 according to Mayers. If\r\nthis be true, and especially if the second of these dates is the true\r\none, it may be admitted that maize was brought to China after the\r\ndiscovery of America. The Portuguese came to Java in 1496,[1989] that is\r\nto say four years after the discovery of America, and to China in\r\n1516.[1990] Magellan’s voyage from South America to the Philippine\r\nIslands took place in 1520. During the fifty-eight or seventy-seven\r\nyears between 1516 and the dates assigned to the Chinese work, seeds of\r\nmaize may have been taken to China by navigators from America or from\r\nEurope. Dr. Bretschneider wrote to me recently that the Chinese did not\r\nknow the new world earlier than the Europeans, and that the lands to the\r\neast of their country, to which there are some allusions in their\r\nancient writings, are the islands of Japan. He had already quoted the\r\nopinion of a Chinese savant, that the introduction of maize in the\r\nneighbourhood of Pekin dates from the last years of the Ming dynasty,\r\nwhich ended in 1644. This date agrees with the other facts. The\r\nintroduction into Japan was probably of later date, since Kæmpfer makes\r\nno mention of the species.[1991]\r\n\r\nFrom all these facts, we conclude that maize is not a native of the old\r\nworld. It became rapidly diffused in it after the discovery of America,\r\nand this very rapidity completes the proof that, had it existed anywhere\r\nin Asia or Africa, it would have played an important part in agriculture\r\nfor thousands of years.\r\n\r\nWe shall see that the facts are quite contrary to these in America.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the discovery of the new continent, maize was one of the\r\nstaples of its agriculture, from the La Plata valley to the United\r\nStates. It had names in all the languages.[1992] The natives planted it\r\nround their temporary dwellings where they did not form a fixed\r\npopulation. The burial-mounds of the natives of North America who\r\npreceded those of our day, the tombs of the Incas, the catacombs of\r\nPeru, contain ears or grains of maize, just as the monuments of ancient\r\nEgypt contain grains of barley and wheat and millet-seed. In Mexico, a\r\ngoddess who bore a name derived from that of maize (_Cinteutl_, from\r\n_Cintli_) answered to the Ceres of the Greeks, for the first-fruits of\r\nthe maize harvest were offered to her, as the first-fruits of our\r\ncereals to the Greek goddess. At Cusco the virgins of the sun offered\r\nsacrifices of bread made from Indian corn. Nothing is better calculated\r\nto show the antiquity and generality of the cultivation of a plant than\r\nthis intimate connection with the religious rites of the ancient\r\ninhabitants. We must not, however, attribute to these indications the\r\nsame importance in America as in the old world. The civilization of the\r\nPeruvians under the Incas, and that of the Toltecs and Aztecs in Mexico,\r\nhas not the extraordinary antiquity of the civilizations of China,\r\nChaldea, and Egypt. It dates at earliest from the beginning of the\r\nChristian era; but the cultivation of maize is more ancient than the\r\nmonuments, to judge from the numerous varieties of the species found in\r\nthem, and their dispersal into remote regions.\r\n\r\nA yet more remarkable proof of antiquity has been discovered by Darwin.\r\nHe found ears of Indian corn, and eighteen species of shells of our\r\nepoch, buried in the soil of the shore in Peru, now at least eighty-five\r\nfeet above the level of the sea.[1993] This maize was perhaps not\r\ncultivated, but in this case it would be yet more interesting, as an\r\nindication of the origin of the species.\r\n\r\nAlthough America has been explored by a great number of botanists, none\r\nhave found maize in the conditions of a wild plant.\r\n\r\nAuguste de Saint-Hilaire[1994] thought he recognized the wild type in a\r\nsingular variety, of which each grain is enclosed within its sheath or\r\nbract. It is known at Buenos-Ayres under the name _pinsigallo_. It is\r\n_Zea Mays tunicata_ of Saint-Hilaire, of which Bonafous gives an\r\nillustration, pl. 5, _bis_, under the name _Zea cryptosperma_.\r\nLindley[1995] also gives a description and a drawing from seeds brought,\r\nit is said, from the Rocky Mountains, but this is not confirmed by\r\nrecent Californian floras. A young Guarany, born in Paraguay on its\r\nfrontiers, had recognized this maize, and told Saint-Hilaire that it\r\ngrew in the damp forests of his country. This is very insufficient proof\r\nthat it is indigenous. No traveller to my knowledge has seen this plant\r\nwild in Paraguay or Brazil. But it is an interesting fact that it has\r\nbeen cultivated in Europe, and that it often passes into the ordinary\r\nstate of maize. Lindley observed it when it had been only two or three\r\nyears in cultivation, and Professor Radic obtained from one sowing 225\r\nears of the form _tunicata_, and 105 of the common form with naked\r\ngrains.[1996] Evidently this form, which might be believed a true\r\nspecies, but whose country is, however, doubtful, is hardly even a race.\r\nIt is one of the innumerable varieties, more or less hereditary, of\r\nwhich botanists who are considered authorities make only a single\r\nspecies, because of their want of stability and the transitions which\r\nthey frequently present.\r\n\r\nOn the condition of _Zea Mays_, and its habitation in America before it\r\nwas cultivated, we have nothing but conjectural knowledge. I will state\r\nwhat I take to be the sum of this, because it leads to certain probable\r\nindications.\r\n\r\nI remark first that maize is a plant singularly unprovided with means of\r\ndispersion and protection. The grains are hard to detach from the ear,\r\nwhich is itself enveloped. They have no tuft or wing to catch the wind,\r\nand when the ear is not gathered by man the grains fall still fixed in\r\nthe receptacle, and then rodents and other animals must destroy them in\r\nquantities, and all the more that they are not sufficiently hard to pass\r\nintact through the digestive organs. Probably so unprotected a species\r\nwas becoming more and more rare in some limited region, and was on the\r\npoint of becoming extinct, when a wandering tribe of savages, having\r\nperceived its nutritious qualities, saved it from destruction by\r\ncultivating it. I am the more disposed to believe that its natural area\r\nwas small that the species is unique; that is to say, that it\r\nconstitutes what is called a single-typed genus. The genera which\r\ncontain few species, and especially the monotypes, have as a rule more\r\nrestricted areas than others. Palæontology will perhaps one day show\r\nwhether there ever existed in America several species of _Zea_, or\r\nsimilar Graminæ, of which maize is the last survivor. Now, the genus Zea\r\nis not only a monotype, but stands almost alone in its family. A single\r\ngenus, _Euchlæna_ of Schrader, may be compared with it, of which there\r\nis one species in Mexico and another in Guatemala; but it is a quite\r\ndistinct genus, and there are no intermediate forms between it and\r\n_Zea_.\r\n\r\nWittmack has made some curious researches in order to discover which\r\nvariety of maize probably represents the form belonging to the epoch\r\nanterior to cultivation. For this purpose he has compared ears and\r\ngrains taken from the mounds of North America with those from Peru. If\r\nthese monuments offered only one form of maize, the result would be\r\nimportant, but several different varieties have been found in the mounds\r\nand in Peru. This is not very surprising; these monuments are not very\r\nancient. The cemetery of Ancon in Peru, whence Wittmack obtained his\r\nbest specimens, is nearly contemporary with the discovery of\r\nAmerica.[1997] Now, at that epoch the number of varieties was already\r\nconsiderable, which proves a much more ancient cultivation.\r\n\r\nExperiments in sowing varieties of maize in uncultivated ground several\r\nyears in succession would perhaps show a reversion to some common form\r\nwhich might then be considered as the original stock, but nothing of\r\nthis kind has been attempted. The varieties have only been observed to\r\nlack stability in spite of their great diversity.\r\n\r\nAs to the habitation of the unknown primitive form, the following\r\nconsiderations may enable us to guess it. Settled populations can only\r\nhave been formed where nutritious species existed naturally in soil easy\r\nof cultivation. The potato, the sweet potato, and maize doubtless\r\nfulfilled these conditions in America, and as the great populations of\r\nthis part of the world existed first in the high grounds of Chili and\r\nMexico, it is there probably that wild maize existed. We must not look\r\nfor it in the low-lying regions such as Paraguay and the banks of the\r\nAmazon, or the hot districts of Guiana, Panama, and Mexico, since their\r\ninhabitants were formerly less numerous. Besides, forests are\r\nunfavourable to annuals, and maize does not thrive in the warm damp\r\nclimates where manioc is grown.[1998] On the other hand, its\r\ntransmission from one tribe to another is easier to comprehend if we\r\nsuppose the point of departure in the centre, than if we place it at one\r\nof the limits of the area over which the species was cultivated at the\r\ntime of the Incas and the Toltecs, or rather of the Mayas, Nahuas, and\r\nChibehas, who preceded these. The migrations of peoples have not always\r\nfollowed a fixed course from north to south, or from south to north.\r\nThey have taken different directions according to the epoch and the\r\ncountry.[1999] The ancient Peruvians scarcely knew the Mexicans, and\r\n_vice versâ_, as the total difference of their beliefs and customs\r\nshows. As they both early cultivated maize, we must suppose an\r\nintermediate point of departure. New Granada seems to me to fulfil these\r\nconditions. The nation called Chibcha which occupied the table-land of\r\nBogota at the time of the Spanish conquest, and considered itself\r\naboriginal, was an agricultural people. It enjoyed a certain degree of\r\ncivilization, as the monuments recently investigated show. Perhaps this\r\ntribe first possessed and cultivated maize. It marched with Peru, then\r\nbut little civilized, on the one hand, and with the Mayas on the other,\r\nwho occupied Central America and Yucatan. These were often at war with\r\nthe Nahuas, predecessors of the Toltecs and the Aztecs in Mexico. There\r\nis a tradition that Nahualt, chief of the Nahuas, taught the cultivation\r\nof maize.[2000]\r\n\r\nI dare not hope that maize will be found wild, although its habitation\r\nbefore it was cultivated was probably so small that botanists have\r\nperhaps not yet come across it. The species is so distinct from all\r\nothers, and so striking, that natives or unscientific colonists would\r\nhave noticed and spoken of it. The certainty as to its origin will\r\nprobably come rather from archæological discoveries. If a great number\r\nof monuments in all parts of America are studied, if the hieroglyphical\r\ninscriptions of some of these are deciphered, and if dates of migrations\r\nand economical events are discovered, our hypothesis will be justified,\r\nmodified, or rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Article II._—Seeds used for Different Purposes.\r\n\r\n+Poppy+—_Papaver somniferum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe poppy is usually cultivated for the oil contained in the seed, and\r\nsometimes, especially in Asia, for the sap, extracted by making\r\nincisions in the capsules, and from which opium is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe variety which has been cultivated for centuries escapes readily from\r\ncultivation, or becomes almost naturalized in certain localities of the\r\nsouth of Europe.[2001] It cannot be said to exist in a really wild\r\nstate, but botanists are agreed in regarding it as a modification of the\r\npoppy called _Papaver setigerum_, which is wild on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, notably in Spain, Algeria, Corsica, Sicily, Greece, and\r\nthe island of Cyprus. It has not been met with in Eastern Asia,[2002]\r\nconsequently this is really the original of the cultivated form. Its\r\ncultivation must have begun in Europe or in the north of Africa. In\r\nsupport of this theory we find that the Swiss lake-dwellers of the stone\r\nage cultivated a poppy which is nearer to _P. setigerum_ than to _P.\r\nsomniferum_. Heer[2003] has not been able to find any of the leaves, but\r\nthe capsule is surmounted by eight stigmas, as in _P. setigerum_, and\r\nnot by ten or twelve, as in the cultivated poppy. This latter form,\r\nunknown in nature, seems therefore to have been developed within\r\nhistoric times. _P. setigerum_ is still cultivated in the north of\r\nFrance, together with _P. somniferum_, for the sake of its oil.[2004]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks were well acquainted with the cultivated poppy.\r\nHomer, Theophrastus, and Dioscorides mention it. They were aware of the\r\nsomniferous properties of the sap, and Dioscorides[2005] mentions the\r\nvariety with white seeds. The Romans cultivated the poppy before the\r\nrepublic, as we see by the anecdote of Tarquin and the poppy-heads. They\r\nmixed its seeds with their flour in making bread.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians of Pliny’s time[2006] used the juice of the poppy as a\r\nmedicament, but we have no proof that this plant was cultivated in Egypt\r\nin more ancient times.[2007] In the Middle Ages[2008] and in our own day\r\nit is one of the principal objects of cultivation in that country,\r\nespecially for the manufacture of opium. Hebrew writings do not mention\r\nthe species. On the other hand, there are one or two Sanskrit names.\r\nPiddington gives _chosa_, and Adolphe Pictet _khaskhasa_, which recurs,\r\nhe says, in the Persian _chashchâsh_, the Armenian _chashchâsh_,[2009]\r\nand in Arabic. Another Persian name is _kouknar_.[2010] These names, and\r\nothers I could quote, very different from the _maikôn_ (Μήκων) of the\r\nGreeks, are an indication of an ancient cultivation in Europe and\r\nWestern Asia. If the species was first cultivated in prehistoric time in\r\nGreece, as appears probable, it may have spread eastward before the\r\nAryan invasion of India, but it is strange that there should be no proof\r\nof its extension into Palestine and Egypt before the Roman epoch. It is\r\nalso possible that in Europe the variety called _Papaver setigerum_,\r\nemployed by the Swiss lake-dwellers, was first cultivated, and that the\r\nvariety now grown came from Asia Minor, where the species has been\r\ncultivated for at least three thousand years. This theory is supported\r\nby the existence of the Greek name _maikôn_, in Dorian _makon_, in\r\nseveral Slav languages, and in those of the peoples to the south of the\r\nCaucasus, under the form _mack_.[2011]\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the poppy in India has been recently extended,\r\nbecause of the importation of opium into China; but the Chinese will\r\nsoon cease to vex the English by buying this poison of them, for they\r\nare beginning eagerly to produce it themselves. The poppy is now grown\r\nover more than half of their territory.[2012] The species is never wild\r\nin the east of Asia, and even as regards China its cultivation is\r\nrecent.[2013]\r\n\r\nThe name opium given to the drug extracted from the juice of the capsule\r\nis derived from the Greek. Dioscorides wrote _opos_ (Οπος). The Arabs\r\nconverted it into _afiun_,[2014] and spread it eastwards even to China.\r\n\r\nFlückiger and Hanbury[2015] give a detailed and interesting account of\r\nthe extraction, trade, and use of opium in all countries, particularly\r\nin China. Yet I imagine my readers may like to read the following\r\nextracts from Dr. Bretschneider’s letters, dated from Pekin, Aug. 23,\r\n1881, Jan. 28, and June 18, 1882. They give the most certain information\r\nwhich can be derived from accurately translated Chinese works.\r\n\r\n“The author of the _Pent-sao-kang-mou_, who wrote in 1552 and 1578,\r\ngives some details concerning the _a-fou-yong_ (that is _afioun_,\r\n_opiun_), a foreign drug produced by a species of _ying-sou_ with red\r\nflowers in the country of Tien-fang (Arabia), and recently used as a\r\nmedicament in China. In the time of the preceding dynasty there had been\r\nmuch talk of the _a-fou-yong_. The Chinese author gives some details\r\nrelative to the extraction of opium in his native country, but he does\r\nnot say that it is also produced in China, nor does he allude to the\r\npractice of smoking it. In the _Descriptive Dictionary of the Indian\r\nIslands_, by Crawfurd, p. 312, I find the following passage: ‘The\r\nearliest account we have of the use of opium, not only from the\r\nArchipelago, but also from India and China, is by the faithful,\r\nintelligent Barbosa.[2016] He rates it among the articles brought by the\r\nMoorish and Gentile merchants of Western India, to exchange for the\r\ncargoes of Chinese junks.’”\r\n\r\n“It is difficult to fix the exact date at which the Chinese began to\r\nsmoke opium and to cultivate the poppy which produces it. As I have\r\nsaid, there is much confusion on this head, and not only European\r\nauthors, but also the modern Chinese, apply the name _ying-sou_ to _P.\r\nsomniferum_ as well as to _P. rhæas_. _P. somniferum_ is now extensively\r\ncultivated in all the provinces of the Chinese empire, and also in\r\nMantchuria and Mongolia. Williamson (_Journeys in North China,\r\nMantchuria, Mongolia_, 1868, ii. p. 55) saw it cultivated everywhere in\r\nMantchuria. He was told that the cultivation of the poppy was twice as\r\nprofitable as that of cereals. Potanin, a Russian traveller, who visited\r\nNorthern Mongolia in 1876, saw immense plantations of the poppy in the\r\nvalley of Kiran (between lat. 47° and 48°), This alarms the Chinese\r\ngovernment, and still more the English, who dread the competition of\r\nnative opium.”\r\n\r\n“You are probably aware that opium is eaten, not smoked, in India and\r\nPersia. The practice of smoking this drug appears to be a Chinese\r\ninvention, and modern. Nothing proves that the Chinese smoked opium\r\nbefore the middle of the last century. The Jesuit missionaries to China\r\nin the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries do not mention it; Father\r\nd’Incarville alone says in 1750 that the sale of opium is forbidden\r\nbecause it was used by suicides. Two edicts forbidding the smoking of\r\nopium date from before 1730, and another in 1796 speaks of the progress\r\nmade by the vice in question. Don Sinibaldo di Mas, who in 1858\r\npublished a very good book on China, where he had lived many years as\r\nSpanish ambassador, says that the Chinese took the practice from the\r\npeople of Assam, where the custom had long existed.”\r\n\r\nSo bad a habit, like the use of tobacco or absinth, is sure to spread.\r\nIt is becoming gradually introduced into the countries which have\r\nfrequent relations with China. It is to be hoped that it will not attack\r\nso large a proportion of the peoples of other countries as in Amoy,\r\nwhere the proportion of opium-smokers are as fifteen to twenty of the\r\nadult population.[2017]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Arnotto+, or +Anatto+—_Bisca orellana_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe dye, called _rocou_ in French, _arnotto_ in English, is extracted\r\nfrom the pulp which encases the seed. The inhabitants of the West India\r\nIslands, of the Isthmus of Darien, and of Brazil, used it at the time of\r\nthe discovery of America to stain their bodies red, and the Mexicans in\r\npainting.[2018] The arnotto, a small tree of the order Bixaceæ, grows\r\nwild in the West Indies,[2019] and over a great part of the continent of\r\nAmerica between the tropics. Herbaria and floras abound in indications\r\nof locality, but do not generally specify whether the species is\r\ncultivated, wild, or naturalized. I note, however, that it is said to be\r\nindigenous by Seemann on the north-west coast of Mexico and Panama, by\r\nTriana in New Granada, by Meyer in Dutch Guiana, and by Piso and\r\nClaussen in Brazil.[2020] With such a vast area, it is not surprising\r\nthat the species has many names in American languages; that of the\r\nBrazilians, _urucu_, is the origin of _rocou_.\r\n\r\nIt was not very necessary to plant this tree in order to obtain its\r\nproduct; nevertheless Piso relates that the Brazilians, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, were not content with the wild plant, and in Jamaica, in the\r\nseventeenth century, the plantations of Bixa were common. It was one of\r\nthe first species transported from America to the south of Asia and to\r\nAfrica. It has become so entirely naturalized, that Roxburgh[2021]\r\nbelieved it to be indigenous in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Cotton+—_Gossypium herbaceum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1855, I sought the origin of the cultivated cottons,[2022]\r\nthere was still great uncertainty as to the distinction of the species.\r\nSince then two excellent works have appeared in Italy, upon which we can\r\nrely; one by Parlatore,[2023] formerly director of the botanical gardens\r\nat Florence, the other by Todaro,[2024] of Palermo. These two works are\r\nillustrated with magnificent coloured plates. Nothing better can be\r\ndesired for the cultivated cottons. On the other hand, our knowledge of\r\nthe true species, I mean of those which exist naturally in a wild state,\r\nhas not increased as much as it might. However, the definition of\r\nspecies seems fairly accurate in the works of Dr. Masters,[2025] whom I\r\nshall therefore follow. This author agrees with Parlatore in admitting\r\nseven well-known species and two doubtful, while Todaro counts\r\nfifty-four, of which only two are doubtful, reckoning as species forms\r\nwith some distinguishing character, but which originated and are\r\npreserved by cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe common names of the cottons give no assistance; they are even\r\ncalculated to lead us completely astray as to the origin of the species.\r\nA cotton called Siamese comes from America; another is called Brazilian\r\nor Ava cotton, according to the fancy or the error of cultivators.\r\n\r\nWe will first consider _Gossypium herbaceum_, an ancient species in\r\nAsiatic plantations, and now the commonest in Europe and in the United\r\nStates. In the hot countries whence it came, its stem lasts several\r\nyears, but out of the tropics it becomes annual from the effect of the\r\nwinter’s cold. The flower is generally yellow, with a red centre; the\r\ncotton yellow or white, according to the variety. Parlatore examined in\r\nherbaria several wild specimens, and cultivated others derived from wild\r\nplants of the Indian Peninsula. He also admits it to be indigenous in\r\nBurmah and in the Indian Archipelago, from the specimens of collectors,\r\nwho have not perhaps been sufficiently careful to verify its wild\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nMasters regards as undoubtedly wild in Sindh a form which he calls\r\n_Gossypium Stocksii_, which he says is probably the wild condition of\r\n_Gossypium herbaceum_, and of other cottons cultivated in India for a\r\nlong time. Todaro, who is not given to uniting many forms in a single\r\nspecies, nevertheless admits the identity of this variety with the\r\ncommon _G. herbaceum_. The yellow colour of the cotton is then the\r\nnatural condition of the species. The seed has not the short down which\r\nexists between the longer hairs in the cultivated _G. herbaceum_.\r\n\r\nCultivation has probably extended the area of the species beyond the\r\nlimits of the primitive habitation. This is, I imagine, the case in the\r\nSunda Islands and the Malay Peninsula, where certain individuals appear\r\nmore or less wild. Kurz,[2026] in his Burmese flora, mentions _G.\r\nherbaceum_, with yellow or white cotton, as cultivated and also as wild\r\nin desert places and waste ground.\r\n\r\nThe herbaceous cotton is called _kapase_ in Bengali, _kapas_ in\r\nHindustani, which shows that the Sanskrit word _karpassi_ undoubtedly\r\nrefers to this species.[2027] It was early cultivated in Bactriana,\r\nwhere the Greeks had noticed it at the time of the expedition of\r\nAlexander. Theophrastus speaks of it[2028] in such a manner as to leave\r\nno doubt. The tree-cotton of the Isle of Tylos, in the Persian Gulf, of\r\nwhich he makes mention further on,[2029] was probably also _G.\r\nherbaceum_; for Tylos is not far from India, and in such a hot climate\r\nthe herbaceous cotton becomes a shrub. The introduction of a cotton\r\nplant into China took place only in the ninth or tenth century of our\r\nera, which shows that probably the area of _G. herbaceum_ was originally\r\nlimited to the south and east of India. The knowledge and perhaps the\r\ncultivation of the Asiatic cotton was propagated in the Græco-Roman\r\nworld after the expedition of Alexander, but before the first centuries\r\nof the Christian era.[2030] If the _byssos_ of the Greeks was the cotton\r\nplant, as most scholars think, it was cultivated at Elis, according to\r\nPausanias and Pliny;[2031] but Curtius and C. Ritter[2032] consider the\r\nword _byssos_ as a general term for threads, and that it was probably\r\napplied in this case to fine linen. It is evident that the cotton was\r\nnever, or very rarely, cultivated by the ancients. It is so useful that\r\nit would have become common if it had been introduced into a single\r\nlocality—in Greece, for instance. It was afterwards propagated on the\r\nshores of the Mediterranean by the Arabs, as we see from the name _qutn_\r\nor _kutn_,[2033] which has passed into the modern languages of the south\r\nof Europe as _cotone_, _coton_, _algodon_. Eben el Awan, of Seville, who\r\nlived in the twelfth century, describes its cultivation as it was\r\npractised in his time in Sicily, Spain, and the East.[2034]\r\n\r\n_Gossypium herbaceum_ is the species most cultivated in the United\r\nStates.[2035] It was probably introduced there from Europe. It was a new\r\ncultivation a hundred years ago, for a bale of North American cotton was\r\nconfiscated at Liverpool in 1774, on the plea that the cotton-plant did\r\nnot grow there.[2036] The silky cotton (_sea island_) is another\r\nspecies, American, of which I shall presently speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Tree-Cotton+—_Gossypium arboreum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis species is taller and of longer duration than the herbaceous\r\ncotton; the lobes of the leaf are narrower, the bracts less divided or\r\nentire. The flower is usually pink, with a red centre. The cotton is\r\nalways white.\r\n\r\nAccording to Anglo-Indian botanists, this is not, as it was supposed, an\r\nIndian species, and is even rarely cultivated in India. It is a native\r\nof tropical Africa. It has been seen wild in Upper Guinea, in Abyssinia,\r\nSennaar, and Upper Egypt.[2037] So great a number of collectors have\r\nbrought it from these countries, that there is no room for doubt; but\r\ncultivation has so diffused and mixed this species with others that it\r\nhas been described under several names in works on Southern Asia.\r\n\r\nParlatore attributed to _G. arboreum_ some Asiatic specimens of _G.\r\nherbaceum_, and a plant but little known which Forskal found in Arabia.\r\nHe suspected from this that the ancients had known _G. arboreum_ as well\r\nas _G. herbaceum_. Now that the two species are better distinguished,\r\nand that the origin of both is known, this does not seem probable. They\r\nknew the herbaceous cotton through India and Persia, while the\r\ntree-cotton can only have come to them through Egypt. Parlatore himself\r\nhas given a most interesting proof of this. Until his work appeared in\r\n1866, it was not certain to what species belonged some seeds of the\r\ncotton plant which Rosellini found in a vase among the monuments of\r\nancient Thebes.[2038] These seeds are in the Florence museum. Parlatore\r\nexamined them carefully, and declares them to belong to _Gossypium\r\narboreum_.[2039] Rosellini is certain he was not imposed upon, as he was\r\nthe first to open both the tomb and the vase. No archæologist has since\r\nseen or read signs of the cotton plant in the ancient times of Egyptian\r\ncivilization. How is it that a plant so striking, remarkable for its\r\nflowers and seed, was not described nor preserved habitually in the\r\ntombs if it were cultivated? How is it that Herodotus, Dioscorides, and\r\nTheophrastus made no mention of it when writing of Egypt? The cloths in\r\nwhich all the mummies are wrapt, and which were formerly supposed to be\r\ncotton, are always linen according to Thompson and many other observers\r\nwho are familiar with the use of the microscope. Hence I conclude that\r\nif the seeds found by Rosellini were really ancient they were a rarity,\r\nan exception to the common custom, perhaps the product of a tree\r\ncultivated in a garden, or perhaps they came from Upper Egypt, a\r\ncountry where we know the tree-cotton to be wild. Pliny[2040] does not\r\nsay that cotton was cultivated in Lower Egypt; but here is a translation\r\nof his very remarkable passage, which is often quoted. “The upper part\r\nof Egypt, towards Arabia, produces a shrub which some call _gossipion_\r\nand others _xylon_, whence the name _xylina_ given to the threads\r\nobtained from it. It is low-growing, and bears a fruit like that of the\r\nbearded nut, and from the interior of this is taken a wool for weaving.\r\nNone is comparable to this in softness and whiteness.” Pliny adds, “The\r\ncloth made from it is used by preference for the dress of the Egyptian\r\npriests.” Perhaps the cotton destined to this purpose was sent from\r\nUpper Egypt, or perhaps the author, who had not seen the fabrication,\r\nand did not possess a microscope, was mistaken in the nature of the\r\nsacerdotal raiment, as were our contemporaries who handled the\r\ngrave-cloths of hundreds of mummies before suspecting that they were not\r\ncotton. Among the Jews, the priestly robes were commanded to be of\r\nlinen, and it is not likely that their custom was different to that of\r\nthe Egyptians.\r\n\r\nPollux,[2041] born in Egypt a century later than Pliny, expresses\r\nhimself clearly about the cotton plant, of which the thread was used by\r\nhis countrymen; but he does not say whence the shrub came, and we cannot\r\ntell whether it was _Gossypium arboreum_ or _G. herbaceum_. It does not\r\neven appear whether the plant was cultivated in Lower Egypt, or if the\r\ncotton came from the more southern region. In spite of these doubts, it\r\nmay be suspected that a cotton plant, probably that of Upper Egypt, had\r\nrecently been introduced into the Delta. The species which Prosper Alpin\r\nhad seen cultivated in Egypt in the sixteenth century was the\r\ntree-cotton. The Arabs, and afterwards Europeans, preferred and\r\ntransported into different countries the herbaceous cotton rather than\r\nthe tree-cotton, which yields a poorer product and requires more heat.\r\n\r\nRegarding the two cottons of the old world, I have made as little use as\r\npossible of arguments based upon Greek names, such as βυσσος, σινδον,\r\nξυλον, Οθων etc., or Sanskrit names, and their derivatives, as\r\n_carbasa_, _carpas_, or Hebrew names, _schesch_, _buz_, which are\r\ndoubtfully attributed to the cotton tree. This has been a fruitful\r\nsubject of discussion,[2042] but the clearer distinction of species and\r\nthe discovery of their origin greatly diminishes the importance of these\r\nquestions—to naturalists, at least, who prefer facts to words. Moreover,\r\nReynier, and after him C. Ritter, arrived in their researches at a\r\nconclusion which we must not forget: that these same names were often\r\napplied by ancient peoples to different plants and tissues—to linen and\r\ncotton, for example. In this case as in others, modern botany explains\r\nancient words where words and the commentaries of philologists may\r\nmislead.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Barbados Cotton+—_Gossypium barbadense_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the discovery of America, the Spaniards found the\r\ncultivation and use of cotton established from the West India Islands to\r\nPeru, and from Mexico to Brazil. The fact is proved by all the\r\nhistorians of the epoch. But it is still very difficult to tell what\r\nwere the species of these American cottons and in what countries they\r\nwere indigenous. The botanical distinction of the American species or\r\nvarieties is in the last degree confused. Authors, even those who have\r\nseen large collections of growing cotton plants, are not agreed as to\r\nthe characters. They are also embarrassed by the difficulty of deciding\r\nwhich of the specific names of Linnæus should be retained, for the\r\noriginal definitions are insufficient. The introduction of American seed\r\ninto African and Asiatic plantations has given rise to further\r\ncomplications, as botanists in Java, Calcutta, Bourbon, etc., have often\r\ndescribed American forms as species under different names. Todaro admits\r\nten American species; Parlatore reduced them to three, which answer, he\r\nsays, to _Gossypium hirsutum_, _G. barbadense_, and _G. religiosum_ of\r\nLinnæus; lastly, Dr. Masters unites all the American forms into a single\r\nspecies which he calls _G. barbadense_, giving as the chief character\r\nthat the seed bears only long hairs, whereas the species of the old\r\nworld have a short down underneath the longer hairs.[2043] The flower is\r\nyellow, with a red centre. The cotton is white or yellow. Parlatore\r\nstrove to include fifty or sixty of the cultivated forms under one or\r\nother of the three heads he admits, from the study of plants in gardens\r\nor herbaria. Dr. Masters mentions but few synonyms, and it is possible\r\nthat certain forms with which he is not acquainted do not come under the\r\ndefinition of his single species.\r\n\r\nWhere there is such confusion it would be the best course for botanists\r\nto seek with care the _Gossypia_, which are wild in America, to\r\nconstitute the one or more species solely upon these, leaving to the\r\ncultivated species their strange and often absurd and misleading names.\r\nI state this opinion because with regard to no other genus of cultivated\r\nplants have I felt so strongly that natural history should be based upon\r\nnatural facts, and not upon the artificial products of cultivation. If\r\nwe start from this point of view, which has the merit of being a truly\r\nscientific method, we find unfortunately that our knowledge of the\r\ncottons indigenous in America is still in a very elementary state. At\r\nmost we can name only one or two collectors who have found _Gossypia_\r\nreally identical with or very similar to certain cultivated forms.\r\n\r\nWe can seldom trust early botanists and travellers on this head. The\r\ncotton plant grows sometimes in the neighbourhood of plantations, and\r\nbecomes more or less naturalized, as the down on the seeds facilitates\r\naccidental transport. The usual expression of early writers—such a\r\ncotton plant _grows_ in such a country—often means a cultivated plant.\r\nLinnæus himself in the eighteenth century often says of a cultivated\r\nspecies, “_habitat_,” and he even says it sometimes without good\r\nground.[2044] Hernandez, one of the most accurate among\r\nsixteenth-century authors, is quoted as having described and figured a\r\nwild _Gossypium_ in Mexico, but the text suggests some doubts as to the\r\nwild condition of this plant,[2045] which Parlatore believes to be _G.\r\nhirsutum_, Linnæus. Hemsley,[2046] in his catalogue of Mexican plants,\r\nmerely says of a _Gossypium_ which he calls barbadense, “wild and\r\ncultivated.” He gives no proof of the former condition. Macfadyen[2047]\r\nmentions three forms wild and cultivated in Jamaica. He attributes\r\nspecific names to them, and adds that they possibly all may be included\r\nin Linnæus’ _G. hirsutum_. Grisebach[2048] admits that one species, _G.\r\nbarbadense_, is wild in the West Indies. As to the specific\r\ndistinctions, he declares himself unable to establish them with\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nWith regard to New Grenada, Triana[2049] describes a _Gossypium_ which\r\nhe calls _G. barbadense_, Linnæus, and which he says is “cultivated and\r\nhalf wild along the Rio Seco, in the province of Bogota, and in the\r\nvalley of the Cauca near Cali;” and he adds a variety, _hirsutum_,\r\ngrowing (he does not say whether spontaneously or no) along the Rio\r\nSeco. I cannot discover any similar assertion for Peru, Guiana, and\r\nBrazil;[2050] but the flora of Chili, published by Cl. Gay,[2051]\r\nmentions a _Gossypium_, “almost wild in the province of Copiapo,” which\r\nthe writer attributes to the variety _G. peruvianum_, Cavanilles. Now,\r\nthis author does not say the plant is wild, and Parlatore classes it\r\nwith _G. religiosum_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nAn important variety of cultivation is that of the cotton with long\r\nsilky down, called by Anglo-Americans _sea island_, or _long staple\r\ncotton_, which Parlatore ranks with _G. barbadense_, Linnæus. It is\r\nconsidered to be of American origin, but no one has seen it wild.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if historical records are positive in all that concerns\r\nthe use of cotton in America from a time far earlier than the arrival of\r\nEuropeans, the natural wild habitation of the plant or plants which\r\nyield this product is yet but little known. We become aware on this\r\noccasion of the absence of floras of tropical America, similar to those\r\nof the Dutch and English colonies of Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Mandubi+, +Pea-nut+, +Monkey-nut+—_Arachis hypogæa_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nNothing is more curious than the manner in which this leguminous plant\r\nmatures its fruits. It is cultivated in all hot countries, either for\r\nthe seed, or for the oil contained in the cotyledons.[2052] Bentham has\r\ngiven, in his _Flora of Brazil_, in folio, vol. xv. pl. 23, complete\r\ndetails of the plant, in which may be seen how the flower-stalk bends\r\ndownwards and plunges the pod into the earth to ripen.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the species was disputed for a century, even by those\r\nbotanists who employ the best means to discover it. It is worth while to\r\nshow how the truth was arrived at, as it may serve as a guide in similar\r\ncases. I will quote, therefore, what I wrote in 1855,[2053] giving in\r\nconclusion new proofs which allow no possibility of further doubt.\r\n\r\n“Linnæus[2054] said of the _Arachis_, ‘it inhabits Surinam Brazil, and\r\nPeru.’ As usual with him, he does not specify whether the species was\r\nwild or cultivated in these countries. In 1818, R. Brown[2055] writes:\r\n‘It was probably introduced from China into the continent of India,\r\nCeylon, and into the Malay Archipelago, where, in spite of its now\r\ngeneral cultivation, it is thought not to be indigenous, particularly\r\nfrom the names given to it. I consider it not improbable that it was\r\nbrought from Africa into different parts of equatorial America,\r\nalthough, however, it is mentioned in some of the earliest writings on\r\nthis continent, particularly on Peru and Brazil. According to Sprengel,\r\nit is mentioned by Theophrastus as cultivated in Egypt, but it is not at\r\nall evident that the _Arachis_ is the plant to which Theophrastus\r\nalludes in the quoted passage. If it had been formerly cultivated in\r\nEgypt it would probably still exist in that country, whereas it does not\r\noccur in Forskal’s catalogue nor in Delile’s more extended flora. There\r\nis nothing very unlikely,’ continues Brown, ‘in the hypothesis that the\r\n_Arachis_ is indigenous both in Africa and America; but if it is\r\nconsidered as existing originally in one of these continents only, it is\r\nmore probable that it was brought from China through India to Africa,\r\nthan that it took the contrary direction.’ My father in 1825, in the\r\n_Prodromus_ (ii. p. 474), returned to Linnæus’ opinion, and admitted\r\nwithout hesitation the American origin. “Let us reconsider the question”\r\n(I said in 1855) “with the aid of the discoveries of modern science.\r\n\r\n“_Arachis hypogœa_ was the only species of this singular genus known.\r\nSix other species, all Brazilian, have since been discovered.[2056]\r\nThus, applying the rule of probability of which Brown first made great\r\nuse, we incline _à priori_ to the idea of an American origin. We must\r\nremember that Maregraf[2057] and Piso[2058] describe and figure the\r\nplant as used in Brazil, under the name _mandubi_, which seems to be\r\nindigenous. They quote Monardes, a writer of the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, as having indicated it in Peru under a different name,\r\n_anchic_. Joseph Acosta[2059] merely mentions an American name, _mani_,\r\nand speaks of it with other species which are not of foreign origin in\r\nAmerica. The _Arachis_ was not ancient in Guiana, in the West Indies,\r\nand in Mexico. Aublet[2060] mentions it as a cultivated plant, not in\r\nGuiana, but in the Isle of France. Hernandez does not speak of it.\r\nSloane[2061] had seen it only in a garden, grown from seeds brought from\r\nGuinea. He says that the slave-dealers feed the negroes with it on their\r\npassage from Africa, which indicates a then very general cultivation in\r\nAfrica. Pison, in his second edition (1638, p. 256), not in that of\r\n1648, gives a figure of a similar fruit imported from Africa into Brazil\r\nunder the name _mandobi_, very near to the name of the Arachis,\r\n_mandubi_. From the three leaflets of the plant it would seem to be the\r\n_Voandzeia_, so often cultivated; but the fruit seems to me to be longer\r\nthan in this genus, and it has two or three seeds instead of one or two.\r\nHowever this may be, the distinction drawn by Piso between these two\r\nsubterranean seeds, the one Brazilian, the other African, tends to show\r\nthat the _Arachis_ is Brazilian.\r\n\r\n“The antiquity and the generality of its cultivation in Africa is,\r\nhowever, an argument of some force, which compensates to a certain\r\ndegree its antiquity in Brazil, and the presence of six other _Arachis_\r\nin the same country. I would admit its great value if the _Arachis_ had\r\nbeen known to the ancient Egyptians and to the Arabs; but the silence of\r\nGreek, Latin, and Arab authors, and the absence of the species in Egypt\r\nin Forskal’s time, lead me to think that its cultivation in Guinea,\r\nSenegal,[2062] and the east coast of Africa[2063] is not of very ancient\r\ndate. Neither has it the marks of a great antiquity in Asia. No Sanskrit\r\nname for it is known,[2064] but only a Hindustani one. Rumphius[2065]\r\nsays that it was imported from Japan into several islands of the Indian\r\nArchipelago. It would in that case have borne only foreign names, like\r\nthe Chinese name, for instance, which signifies only ‘earth-bean.’ At\r\nthe end of the last century it was generally cultivated in China and\r\nCochin-China. Yet, in spite of Rumphius’s theory of an introduction\r\ninto the islands from China or Japan, I see that Thunberg does not speak\r\nof it in his _Japanese Flora_. Now, Japan has had dealings with China\r\nfor sixteen centuries, and cultivated plants, natives of one of the two\r\ncountries, were commonly early introduced into the other. It is not\r\nmentioned by Forster among the plants employed in the small islands of\r\nthe Pacific. All these facts point to an American, I might even say a\r\nBrazilian, origin. None of the authors I have consulted mentions having\r\nseen the plant wild, either in the old or the new world. Those who\r\nindicate it in Africa or Asia are careful to say the plant is\r\ncultivated. Marcgraf does not say so, writing of Brazil, but Piso says\r\nthe species is planted.”\r\n\r\nSeeds of _Arachis_ have been found in the Peruvian tombs at Ancon,[2066]\r\nwhich shows some antiquity of existence in America, and supports the\r\nopinion I expressed in 1855. Dr. Bretschneider’s study of Chinese\r\nworks[2067] oversets Brown’s hypothesis. The _Arachis_ is not mentioned\r\nin the ancient works of this country, nor even in the _Pent-sao_,\r\npublished in the sixteenth century. He adds that he believes the plant\r\nwas only introduced in the last century.\r\n\r\nAll the recent floras of Asia and Africa mention the species as a\r\ncultivated one, and most authors believe it to be of American origin.\r\nBentham, after satisfying himself that it had not been found wild in\r\nAmerica or elsewhere, adds that it is perhaps a form derived from one of\r\nthe six other species wild in Brazil, but he does not say which. This is\r\nprobable enough, for a plant provided with an efficacious and very\r\npeculiar manner of germinating does not seem of a nature to become\r\nextinct. It would have been found wild in Brazil in the same condition\r\nas the cultivated plant, if the latter were not a product of\r\ncultivation. Works on Guiana and other parts of America mention the\r\nspecies as a cultivated one; Grisebach[2068] says, moreover, that in\r\nseveral of the West India islands it becomes naturalized from\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nA genus of which all the well-known species are thus placed in a single\r\nregion of America can scarcely have a species common to both\r\nhemispheres; it would be too great an exception to the law of\r\ngeographical botany. But then how did the species (or cultivated\r\nvariety) pass from the American continent to the old world? This is hard\r\nto guess, but I am inclined to believe that the first slave-ships\r\ncarried it from Brazil to Guinea, and the Portuguese from Brazil into\r\nthe islands to the south of Asia, in the end of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Coffee+—_Coffea arabica_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThis shrub, belonging to the family of the Rubiaceæ, is wild in\r\nAbyssinia,[2069] in the Soudan,[2070] and on the coasts of Guinea and\r\nMozambique.[2071] Perhaps in these latter localities, so far removed\r\nfrom the centre, it may be naturalized from cultivation. No one has yet\r\nfound it in Arabia, but this may be explained by the difficulty of\r\npenetrating into the interior of the country. If it is discovered there\r\nit will be hard to prove it wild, for the seeds, which soon lose their\r\nfaculty of germinating, often spring up round the plantations and\r\nnaturalize the species. This has occurred in Brazil and the West India\r\nIslands,[2072] where it is certain that the coffee plant was never\r\nindigenous.\r\n\r\nThe use of coffee seems to be very ancient in Abyssinia. Shehabeddin\r\nBen, author of an Arab manuscript of the fifteenth century (No. 944 of\r\nthe Paris Library), quoted in John Ellis’s excellent work,[2073] says\r\nthat coffee had been used in Abyssinia from time immemorial. Its use,\r\neven as a drug, had not spread into the neighbouring countries, for the\r\ncrusaders did not know it, and the celebrated physician Ebn Baithar,\r\nborn at Malaga, who had travelled over the north of Africa and Syria at\r\nthe beginning of the thirteenth century of the Christian era, does not\r\nmention coffee.[2074] In 1596 Bellus sent to de l’Ecluse some seeds from\r\nwhich the Egyptians extracted the drink _cavé_.[2075] Nearly at the same\r\ntime Prosper Alpin became acquainted with coffee in Egypt itself. He\r\nspeaks of the plant as the “arbor _bon_, cum fructu suo _buna_.” The\r\nname _bon_ recurs also in early authors under the forms _bunnu_,\r\n_buncho_, _bunca_.[2076] The names _cahue_, _cahua_, _chaubé_,[2077]\r\n_cavé_,[2078] refer rather in Egypt and Syria to the prepared drink,\r\nwhence the French word _café_. The name _bunnu_, or something similar,\r\nis certainly the primitive name of the plant which the Abyssinians still\r\ncall _boun_.[2079]\r\n\r\nIf the use of coffee is more ancient in Abyssinia than elsewhere, that\r\nis no proof that its cultivation is very ancient. It is very possible\r\nthat for centuries the berries were sought in the forests, where they\r\nwere doubtless very common. According to the Arabian author quoted\r\nabove, it was a mufti of Aden, nearly his contemporary, who, having seen\r\ncoffee drunk in Persia, introduced the practice at Aden, whence it\r\nspread to Mocha, into Egypt, etc. He says that the coffee plant grew in\r\nArabia.[2080] Other fables or traditions exist, according to which it\r\nwas always an Arabian priest or a monk who invented the drink,[2081] but\r\nthey all leave us in uncertainty as to the date of the first cultivation\r\nof the plant. However this may be, the use of coffee having been spread\r\nfirst in the east, afterwards in the west, in spite of a number of\r\nprohibitions and absurd conflicts,[2082] its production became important\r\nto the colonies. Boerhave tells us that the Burgermeister of Amsterdam,\r\nNicholas Witsen, director of the East India Company, urged the Governor\r\nof Batavia, Van Hoorn, to import coffee berries from Arabia to Batavia.\r\nThis was done, and in 1690 Van Hoorn sent some living plants to Witsen.\r\nThese were placed in the Botanical Gardens of Amsterdam, founded by\r\nWitsen, where they bore fruit. In 1714, the magistrates of the town sent\r\na flourishing plant covered with fruit to Louis XIV., who placed it in\r\nhis garden at Marly. Coffee was also grown in the hothouses of the\r\nking’s garden in Paris. One of the professors of this establishment,\r\nAntoine de Jussieu, had already published in 1713, in the _Mémoires de\r\nl’Académie des Sciences_, an interesting description of the plant from\r\none which Pancras, director of the Botanical Garden at Amsterdam, had\r\nsent to him.\r\n\r\nThe first coffee plants grown in America were introduced into Surinam by\r\nthe Dutch in 1718. The Governor of Cayenne, de la Motte-Aigron, having\r\nbeen at Surinam, obtained some plants in secret and multiplied them in\r\n1725.[2083] The coffee plant was introduced into Martinique by de\r\nClieu,[2084] a naval officer, in 1720, according to Deleuze;[2085] in\r\n1723, according to the _Notices Statistiques sur les Colonies\r\nFrançaises_.[2086] Thence it was introduced into the other French\r\nislands, into Guadaloupe, for instance, in 1730.[2087] Sir Nicholas\r\nLawes first grew it in Jamaica.[2088] From 1718 the French East India\r\nCompany had sent plants of Mocha coffee to Bourbon;[2089] others\r\nsay[2090] that it was even in 1717 that a certain Dufougerais-Grenier\r\nhad coffee plants brought from Mocha into this island. It is known how\r\nthe cultivation of this shrub has been extended in Java, Ceylon, the\r\nWest Indies, and Brazil. Nothing prevents it from spreading in nearly\r\nall tropical countries, especially as the coffee plant thrives on\r\nsloping ground and in poor soils where other crops cannot flourish. It\r\ncorresponds in tropical agriculture to the vine in Europe and tea in\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nFurther details may be found in the volume published by H. Welter[2091]\r\non the economical and commercial history of coffee. The author adds an\r\ninteresting chapter on the various fair or very bad substitutes used for\r\na commodity which it is impossible to overrate in its natural condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Liberian Coffee+—_Coffea liberica_, Hiern.[2092]\r\n\r\nPlants of this species have for some years been sent from the Botanical\r\nGardens at Kew into the English colonies. It grows wild in Liberia,\r\nAngola, Golungo Alto,[2093] and probably in several other parts of\r\nwestern tropical Africa.\r\n\r\nIt is of stronger growth than the common coffee, and the berries, which\r\nare larger, yield an excellent product. The official reports of Kew\r\nGardens by the learned director, Sir Joseph Hooker, show the progress of\r\nthis introduction, which is very favourably received, especially in\r\nDominica.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Madia+—_Madia sativa_, Molina.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Chili before the discovery of America cultivated this\r\nannual species of the Composite family, for the sake of the oil\r\ncontained in the seed. Since the olive has been extensively planted, the\r\nmadia is despised by the Chilians, who only complain of the plant as a\r\nweed which chokes their gardens.[2094] The Europeans began to cultivate\r\nit with indifferent success, owing to its bad smell.\r\n\r\nThe madia is indigenous in Chili and also in California.[2095] There\r\nare other examples of this disjunction of habitation between the two\r\ncountries.[2096]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Nutmeg+—_Myristica fragrans_, Houttuyn.\r\n\r\nThe nutmeg, a little tree of the order _Myristiceœ_, is wild in the\r\nMoluccas, principally in the Banda Islands.[2097] It has long been\r\ncultivated there, to judge from the considerable number of its\r\nvarieties. Europeans have received the nutmeg by the Asiatic trade since\r\nthe Middle Ages, but the Dutch long possessed the monopoly of its\r\ncultivation. When the English owned the Moluccas at the end of the last\r\ncentury, they carried live nutmeg trees to Bencoolen and into Prince\r\nEdward’s Islands.[2098] It afterwards spread to Bourbon, Mauritius,\r\nMadagascar, and into some of the colonies of tropical America, but with\r\nindifferent success from a commercial point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Sesame+—_Sesamum indicum_, de Candolle; _S. indicum_ and _S.\r\norientale_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nSesame has long been cultivated in the hot regions of the old world for\r\nthe sake of the oil extracted from the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe order _Pedalineœ_ to which this annual belongs is composed of\r\nseveral genera distributed through the tropical parts of Asia, Africa,\r\nand America. Each genus has only a small number of species. Sesamum, in\r\nthe widest sense of the name,[2099] has ten, all African except perhaps\r\nthe cultivated species whose origin we are about to seek. The latter\r\nforms alone the true genus Sesamum, which is a section in Bentham and\r\nHooker’s work. Botanical analogy points to an African origin, but the\r\narea of a considerable number of plants is known to extend from the\r\nsouth of Asia into Africa. Sesame has two _races_, the one with black,\r\nthe other with white seed, and several varieties differing in the shape\r\nof the leaf. The difference in the colour of the seeds is very ancient,\r\nas in the case of the poppy.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of sesame often sow themselves outside plantations, and more\r\nor less naturalize the species. This has been observed in regions very\r\nremote one from the other; for instance, in India, the Sunda Isles,\r\nEgypt, and even in the West India Islands, where its cultivation is\r\ncertainly of modern introduction.[2100] This is perhaps the reason that\r\nno author asserts he has found it in a wild state except Blume,[2101] a\r\ntrustworthy observer, who mentions a variety with redder flowers than\r\nusual growing in the mountains of Java. This is doubtless an indication\r\nof origin, but we need others to establish a proof. I shall seek them in\r\nthe history of its cultivation. The country where this began should be\r\nthe ancient habitation of the species, or have had dealings with this\r\nancient habitation.\r\n\r\nThat its cultivation dates in Asia from a very early epoch is clear from\r\nthe diversity of names. Sesame is called in Sanskrit _tila_,[2102] in\r\nMalay _widjin_, in Chinese _moa_ (Rumphius) or _chi-ma_ (Bretschneider),\r\nin Japanese _koba_.[2103] The name _sesam_ is common to Greek, Latin,\r\nand Arabic, with trifling variations of letter. Hence it might be\r\ninferred that its area was very extended, and that the cultivation of\r\nthe plant was begun independently in several different countries. But we\r\nmust not attribute too much importance to such an argument. Chinese\r\nworks seem to show that sesame was not introduced into China before the\r\nChristian era. The first certain mention of it occurs in a book of the\r\nfifth or sixth century, entitled _Tsi-min-yao-chou_.[2104] Before this\r\nthere is confusion between the name of this plant and that of flax, of\r\nwhich the seed also yields an oil, and which is not very ancient in\r\nChina.[2105]\r\n\r\nTheophrastus and Dioscorides say that the Egyptians cultivated a plant\r\ncalled sesame for the oil contained in its seed, and Pliny adds that it\r\ncame from India.[2106] He also speaks of a sesame wild in Egypt from\r\nwhich oil was extracted, but this was probably the castor-oil\r\nplant.[2107] It is not proved that the ancient Egyptians before the time\r\nof Theophrastus cultivated sesame. No drawing or seeds have been found\r\nin the monuments. A drawing from the tomb of Rameses III. show the\r\ncustom of mixing small seeds with flour in making pastry, and in modern\r\ntimes this is done with sesame seeds, but others are also used, and it\r\nis not possible to recognize in the drawing those of the sesame in\r\nparticular.[2108] If the Egyptians had known the species at the time of\r\nthe Exodus, eleven hundred years before Theophrastus, there would\r\nprobably have been some mention of it in the Hebrew books, because of\r\nthe various uses of the seed and especially of the oil. Yet commentators\r\nhave found no trace of it in the Old Testament. The name _semsem_ or\r\n_simsim_ is clearly Semitic, but only of the more recent epoch of the\r\nTalmud,[2109] and of the agricultural treatise of Alawwam,[2110]\r\ncompiled after the Christian era began. It was perhaps a Semitic people\r\nwho introduced the plant and the name _semsem_ (whence the _sesam_ of\r\nthe Greeks) into Egypt after the epoch of the great monuments and of the\r\nExodus. They may have received it with the name from Babylonia, where\r\nHerodotus says[2111] that sesame was cultivated.\r\n\r\nAn ancient cultivation in the Euphrates valley agrees with the existence\r\nof a Sanskrit name, _tila_, the _tilu_ of the Brahmans (Rheede,\r\n_Malabar_, i., ix., pp 105-107), a word of which there are traces in\r\nseveral modern languages of India, particularly in Ceylon.[2112] Thus we\r\nare carried back to India in accordance with the origin of which Pliny\r\nspeaks, but it is possible that India itself may have received the\r\nspecies from the Sunda Isles before the arrival of the Aryan conquerors.\r\nRumphius gives three names for the sesame in these islands, very\r\ndifferent one from the other, and from the Sanskrit word, which supports\r\nthe theory of a more ancient existence in the archipelago than on the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, from the fact that the sesame is wild in Java, and from\r\nhistorical and philological arguments, the plant seems to have had its\r\norigin in the Sunda Isles, It was introduced into India and the\r\nEuphrates valley two or three thousand years ago, and into Egypt at a\r\nless remote epoch, from 1000 to 500 B.C. It was transported from the\r\nGuinea coast to Brazil by the Portuguese,[2113] but it is unknown how\r\nlong it has been cultivated in the rest of Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Castor-oil Plant+—_Ricinus communis_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe most modern works and those in highest repute consider the south of\r\nAsia to be the original home of this _Euphorbiacea_; sometimes they\r\nindicate certain varieties in Africa or America without distinguishing\r\nthe wild from the cultivated plant. I have reason to believe that the\r\ntrue origin is to be found in tropical Africa, in accordance with the\r\nopinion of Ball.[2114]\r\n\r\nThe difficulties with which the question is attended arise from the\r\nantiquity of cultivation in different countries, from the facility with\r\nwhich the plant sows itself and becomes naturalized on rubbish-heaps and\r\nin waste ground, lastly from the diversity of its forms, which have\r\noften been described as species. This latter point need not detain us,\r\nfor Dr. J. Müller’s careful monograph[2115] proves the existence of\r\nsixteen varieties, scarcely hereditary, which pass one into the other by\r\nmany transitions, and constitute, therefore, but one species.\r\n\r\nThe number of varieties is the sign of a very ancient cultivation. They\r\ndiffer more or less as to capsules, seeds, inflorescence, etc. Moreover,\r\nthey are small trees in hot countries, but they do not endure frost, and\r\nbecome annuals north of the Alps and in similar regions. They are in\r\nsuch cases planted in gardens for ornament, while in the tropics, and\r\neven in Italy, they are grown for the sake of the oil contained in the\r\nseed. This oil, which is more or less purgative, is used for lamps in\r\nBengal and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn no country has the species been found wild with such certainty as in\r\nAbyssinia, Sennaar, and the Kordofan. The expressions of authors and\r\ncollectors are distinct on this head. The castor-oil plant is common in\r\nrocky places in the valley of Chiré, near Goumalo, says Quartin Dillon;\r\nit is wild in those parts of Upper Sennaar which are flooded during the\r\nrains, says Hartmann.[2116] I have a specimen from Kotschy, No. 243,\r\ngathered on the northern slope of Mount Kohn, in the Kordofan. The\r\nindications of travellers in Mozambique and on the coast of Guinea are\r\nnot so clear, but it is possible that the natural area of the species\r\ncovers a great part of tropical Africa. As it is a useful species, and\r\none very conspicuous and easily propagated, the negroes must have early\r\ndiffused it. However, as we draw near the Mediterranean, it is no longer\r\nsaid to be indigenous. In Egypt, Schweinfurth and Ascherson[2117] say\r\nthe species is only cultivated and naturalized. Probably in Algeria,\r\nSardinia, and Morocco, and even in the Canaries, where it is principally\r\nfound in the sand on the sea-shore, it has been naturalized for\r\ncenturies. I believe this to be the case with specimens brought from\r\nDjedda, in Arabia, by Schimper, which were gathered near a cistern. Yet\r\nForskal[2118] gathered the caster-oil plant in the mountains of Arabia\r\nFelix, which may signify a wild station. Boissier[2119] indicates it in\r\nBeluchistan and the south of Persia, but as “subspontaneous,” as in\r\nSyria, Anatolia, and Greece.\r\n\r\nRheede[2120] speaks of the plant as cultivated in Malabar and growing in\r\nthe sand, but modern Anglo-Indian authors do not allow that it is wild.\r\nSome make no mention of the species. A few speak of the facility with\r\nwhich the species becomes naturalized from cultivation. Loureiro had\r\nseen it in Cochin-China and in China “cultivated and uncultivated,”\r\nwhich perhaps means escaped from cultivation. Lastly, for the Sunda\r\nIslands, Rumphius[2121] is as usual one of the most interesting\r\nauthorities. The castor-oil plant, he says, grows especially in Java,\r\nwhere it forms immense fields and produces a great quantity of oil. At\r\nAmboyna, it is planted here and there, near dwellings and in fields,\r\nrather for medicinal purposes. The wild species grows in deserted\r\ngardens (_in desertis hortis_); it is doubtless sprung from the\r\ncultivated plant (_sine dubio degeneratio domestica_). In Japan the\r\ncastor-oil plant grows among shrubs and on the slopes of Mount Wuntzen,\r\nbut Franchet and Savatier add,[2122] “probably introduced.” Lastly, Dr.\r\nBretschneider mentions the species in his work of 1870, p. 20; but what\r\nhe says here, and in a letter of 1881, does not argue an ancient\r\ncultivation in China.\r\n\r\nThe species is cultivated in tropical America. It becomes easily\r\nnaturalized in clearings, on rubbish-heaps, etc.; but no botanist has\r\nfound it in the conditions of a really indigenous plant. Its\r\nintroduction must have taken place soon after the discovery of America,\r\nfor a common name, _lamourou_, exists in the West India Islands; and\r\nPiso gives another in Brazil, _nhambuguacu_, _figuero inferno_ in\r\nPortuguese. I have received the largest number of specimens from Bahia;\r\nnone are accompanied by the assertion that it is really indigenous.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt and Western Asia the culture of the species dates from so\r\nremote an epoch that it has given rise to mistakes as to its origin. The\r\nancient Egyptians practised it extensively, according to Herodotus,\r\nPliny, Diodorus, etc. There can be no mistake as to the species, as its\r\nseeds have been found in the tombs.[2123] The Egyptian name was _kiki_.\r\nTheophrastus and Dioscorides mention it, and it is retained in modern\r\nGreek,[2124] while the Arabs have a totally different name, _kerua_,\r\n_kerroa_, _charua_.[2125]\r\n\r\nRoxburgh and Piddington quote a Sanskrit name, _eranda_, _erunda_, which\r\nhas left descendants in the modern languages of India. Botanists do not\r\nsay from what epoch of Sanskrit this name dates; as the species belongs\r\nto hot climates, the Aryans cannot have known it before their arrival in\r\nIndia, that is at a less ancient epoch than the Egyptian monuments.\r\n\r\nThe extreme rapidity of the growth of the castor-oil plant has suggested\r\ndifferent names in Asiatic language, and that of _Wunderbaum_ in German.\r\nThe same circumstance, and the analogy with the Egyptian name _kiki_,\r\nhave caused it to be supposed that the _kikajon_ of the Old\r\nTestament,[2126] the growth, it is said, of a single night, was this\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nI pass a number of common names more or less absurd, as _palma Christi_,\r\n_girasole_, in some parts of Italy, etc., but it is worth while to note\r\nthe origin of the name _castor oil_, as a proof of the English habit of\r\naccepting names without examination, and sometimes of distorting them.\r\nIt appears that in the last century this plant was largely cultivated in\r\nJamaica, where it was once called _agno casto_ by the Portuguese and the\r\nSpaniards, being confounded with _Vitex agnus castus_, a totally\r\ndifferent plant. From _casto_ the English planters and London traders\r\nmade _castor_.[2127]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Walnut+—_Juglans regia_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the walnut tree was known to be wild in Armenia, in the\r\ndistrict to the south of the Caucasus and of the Caspian Sea, in the\r\nmountains of the north and north-east of India, and in Burmah.[2128]\r\nC. Koch[2129] denied that it was indigenous in Armenia and to the south\r\nof the Caucasus, but this has been proved by several travellers. It has\r\nsince been discovered wild in Japan,[2130] which renders it probable\r\nthat the species exists also in the north of China, as Loureiro and\r\nBunge said,[2131] but without particularizing its wild character.\r\nHeldreich[2132] has recently placed it beyond a doubt that the walnut is\r\nabundant in a wild state in the mountains of Greece, which agrees with\r\npassages in Theophrastus[2133] which had been overlooked. Lastly,\r\nHeuffel saw it, also wild, in the mountains of Banat.[2134] Its modern\r\nnatural area extends, then, from eastern temperate Europe to Japan. It\r\nonce existed in Europe further to the west, for leaves of the walnut\r\nhave been found in the quaternary tufa in Provence.[2135] Many species\r\nof Juglans existed in our hemisphere in the tertiary and quaternary\r\nepochs; there are now ten, at most, distributed throughout North America\r\nand temperate Asia.\r\n\r\nThe use of the walnut and the planting of the tree may have begun in\r\nseveral of the countries where the species was found, and cultivation\r\nextended gradually and slightly its artificial area. The walnut is not\r\none of those trees which sows itself and is easily naturalized. The\r\nnature of its fruit is perhaps against this; and, moreover, it needs a\r\nclimate where the frosts are not severe and the heat moderate. It\r\nscarcely passes the northern limit of the vine, and does not extend\r\nnearly so far south.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, accustomed to olive oil, neglected the walnut until they\r\nreceived from Persia a better variety, called _karuon basilikon_,[2136]\r\nor _Persikon_.[2137] The Romans cultivated the walnut from the time of\r\ntheir kings; they considered it of Persian origin.[2138] They had an old\r\ncustom of throwing nuts in the celebration of weddings.\r\n\r\nArchæology confirms these details. The only nuts which have hitherto\r\nbeen found under the lake-dwellings of Switzerland, Savoy, or Italy are\r\nconfined to a single locality near Parma, called Fontinellato, in a\r\nstratum of the iron age.[2139] Now, this metal, very rare at the time of\r\nthe Trojan war, cannot have come into general use among the agricultural\r\npopulation of Italy until the fifth or sixth century before Christ, an\r\nepoch at which even bronze was perhaps still unknown to the north of the\r\nAlps. In the station at Lagozza, walnuts have been found in a much\r\nhigher stratum, and not ancient.[2140] Evidently the walnuts of Italy,\r\nSwitzerland, and France are not descended from the fossil plants of the\r\nquaternary tufa of which I spoke just now.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say at what period the walnut was first planted in\r\nIndia. It must have been early, for there is a Sanskrit name,\r\n_akschôda_, _akhoda_, or _akhôta_. Chinese authors say that the walnut\r\nwas introduced among them from Thibet, under the Han dynasty, by\r\nChang-kien, about the year 140-150 B.C.[2141] This was perhaps a\r\nperfected variety. Moreover, it seems probable, from the actual records\r\nof botanists, that the wild walnut is rare in the north of China, and is\r\nperhaps wanting in the east. The date of its cultivation in Japan is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThe walnut tree and walnuts had an infinite number of names among\r\nancient peoples, which have exercised the science and imagination of\r\nphilologists,[2142] but the origin of the species is so clear that we\r\nneed not stay to consider them.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Areca+—_Areca Catechu_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe areca palm is much cultivated in the countries where it is a custom\r\nto chew betel, that is to say throughout Southern Asia. The nut, or\r\nrather the almond which forms the principal part of the seed contained\r\nin the fruit, is valued for its aromatic taste; chopped, mixed with\r\nlime, and enveloped in a leaf of the pepper-betel, it forms an agreeable\r\nstimulant, which produces a flow of saliva and blackens the teeth to the\r\nsatisfaction of the natives.\r\n\r\nThe author of the principal work on the order Palmaceæ, de\r\nMartius,[2143] says of the origin of this species, “Its country is\r\nuncertain (_non constat_); probably the Sunda Isles.” We may find it\r\npossible to affirm something positive by referring to more modern\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\nOn the continent of India, in Ceylon and Cochin-China, the species is\r\nalways indicated as cultivated.[2144] So in the Sunda Isles, the\r\nMoluccas, etc., to the south of Asia. Blume,[2145] in his work entitled\r\n_Rumphia_, says that the “habitat” of the species is the Malay\r\nPeninsula, Siam, and the neighbouring islands. Yet he does not appear to\r\nhave seen the indigenous plants of which he speaks. Dr.\r\nBretschneider[2146] believes that the species is a native of the Malay\r\nArchipelago, principally of Sumatra, for he says those islands and the\r\nPhilippines are the only places where it is found wild. The first of\r\nthese facts is not confirmed by Miquel, nor the second by Blanco,[2147]\r\nwho lived in the Philippines. Blume’s opinion appears the most probable,\r\nbut we must still say with Martius, “The country is not proved.” The\r\nexistence of a number of Malay names, _pinang_, _jambe_, etc., and of a\r\nSanskrit name, _gouvaka_, as well as very numerous varieties, show the\r\nantiquity of cultivation. The Chinese received it, 111 B.C., from the\r\nsouth, with the Malay name, _pin-lang_. The Telinga name, _arek_, is\r\nthe origin of the botanical name Areca.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Elæis+—_Elæis guineensis_, Jacquin.\r\n\r\nTravellers who visited the coast of Guinea in the first half of the\r\nsixteenth century[2148] already noticed this palm, from which the\r\nnegroes extracted oil by pressing the fleshy part of the fruit. The tree\r\nis indigenous on all that coast.[2149] It is also planted, and the\r\nexportation of palm-oil is the object of an extensive trade. As it is\r\nalso found wild in Brazil and perhaps in Guiana,[2150] a doubt arose as\r\nto the true origin. It seems the more likely to be American that the\r\nonly other species which with this one constitutes the genus _Elæis_\r\nbelongs to New Granada.[2151] Robert Brown, however, and the authors who\r\nhave studied the family of palms, are unanimous in their belief that\r\n_Elæis guineensis_ was introduced into America by the negroes and\r\nslave-traders in the traffic between the Guinea coast and the coast of\r\nAmerica. Many facts confirm this opinion. The first botanists who\r\nvisited Brazil, Piso and Marcgraf and others, do not mention the Elæis.\r\nIt is only found on the littoral, from Rio di Janeiro to the mouth of\r\nthe Amazon, never in the interior. It is often cultivated, or has the\r\nappearance of a species escaped from the plantations. Sloane,[2152] who\r\nexplored Jamaica in the seventeenth century, relates that this tree was\r\nintroduced in his time into a plantation which he names, from the coast\r\nof Guinea. It has since become naturalized in some of the West India\r\nIslands.[2153]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Cocoa-nut Palm+—_Cocos nucifera_, Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe cocoa-nut palm is perhaps, of all tropical trees, the one which\r\nyields the greatest variety of products. Its wood and fibres are\r\nutilized in various ways. The sap extracted from the inner part of the\r\ninflorescence yields a much-prized alcoholic drink. The shell of the nut\r\nforms a vessel, the milk of the half-ripe fruit is a pleasant drink, and\r\nthe nut itself contains a great deal of oil. It is not surprising that\r\nso valuable a tree has been a good deal planted and transported.\r\nBesides, its dispersion is aided by natural causes. The woody shell and\r\nfibrous envelope of the nut enable it to float in salt water without\r\ninjury to the germ. Hence the possibility of its transportation to great\r\ndistances by currents and its naturalization on coasts where the\r\ntemperature is favourable. Unfortunately, this tree requires a warm,\r\ndamp climate, such as exists only in the tropics, or in exceptional\r\nlocalities just without them. Nor does it thrive at a distance from the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe cocoa-nut abounds on the littoral of the warm regions of Asia, of\r\nthe islands to the south of this continent, and in analogous regions of\r\nAfrica and America; but it may be asserted that it dates in Brazil, the\r\nWest Indies, and the west coast of Africa from an introduction which\r\ntook place about three centuries ago. Piso and Marcgraf[2154] seem to\r\nadmit that the species is foreign to Brazil without saying so\r\npositively. De Martius,[2155] who has published a very important work on\r\nthe Palmaceæ, and has travelled through the provinces of Bahia,\r\nPernambuco, and others, where the cocoa-nut abounds, does not say that\r\nit is wild. It was introduced into Guiana by missionaries.[2156]\r\nSloane[2157] says it is an exotic in the West Indies. An old author of\r\nthe sixteenth century, Martyr, whom he quotes, speaks of its\r\nintroduction. This probably took place a few years after the discovery\r\nof America, for Joseph Acosta[2158] saw the cocoa-nut palm at Porto Rico\r\nin the sixteenth century. De Martius says that the Portuguese introduced\r\nit on the coast of Guinea. Many travellers do not even mention it in\r\nthis region, where it is apparently of no great importance. More common\r\nin Madagascar and on the east coast, it is not, however, named in\r\nseveral works on the plants of Zanzibar, the Seychelles, Mauritius,\r\netc., perhaps because it is considered as cultivated in these parts.\r\n\r\nEvidently the species is not of African origin, nor of the eastern part\r\nof tropical America. Eliminating these countries, there remain western\r\ntropical America, the islands of the Pacific, the Indian Archipelago,\r\nand the south of Asia, where the tree abounds with every appearance of\r\nbeing more or less wild and long established.\r\n\r\nThe navigators Dampier and Vancouver[2159] found it at the beginning of\r\nthe seventeenth century, forming woods in the islands near Panama, not\r\non the mainland, and in the isle of Cocos, situated at three hundred\r\nmiles from the continent in the Pacific. At that time these islands were\r\nuninhabited. Later the cocoa-nut palm was found on the western coast\r\nfrom Mexico to Peru, but usually authors do not say that it was wild,\r\nexcepting Seemann,[2160] however, who saw this palm both wild and\r\ncultivated on the Isthmus of Panama. According to Hernandez,[2161] in\r\nthe sixteenth century the Mexicans called it _coyolli_, a word which\r\ndoes not seem to be native.\r\n\r\nOviedo,[2162] writing in 1526, in the first years of the conquest of\r\nMexico, says that the cocoa-nut palm was abundant on the coast of the\r\nPacific in the province of the Cacique Chiman, and he clearly describes\r\nthe species. This does not prove the tree to be wild. In southern Asia,\r\nespecially in the islands, the cocoa-nut is both wild and cultivated.\r\nThe smaller the islands, and the lower and the more subject to the\r\ninfluence of the sea air, the more the cocoa-nut predominates and\r\nattracts the attention of travellers. Some take their name from the\r\ntree, among others two islands close to the Andamans and one near\r\nSumatra.\r\n\r\nThe cocoa-nut occurring with every appearance of an ancient wild\r\ncondition at once in Asia and western America, the question of origin is\r\nobscure. Excellent authors have solved it differently. De Martius\r\nbelieves it to have been transported by currents from the islands\r\nsituated to the west of Central America, into those of the Asiatic\r\nArchipelago. I formerly inclined to the same hypothesis,[2163] since\r\nadmitted without question by Grisebach;[2164] but the botanists of the\r\nseventeenth century often regarded the species as Asiatic, and\r\nSeemann,[2165] after a careful examination, says he cannot come to a\r\ndecision. I will give the reasons for and against each hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIn favour of an American origin, it may be said—\r\n\r\n1. The eleven other species of the genus Cocos are American, and all\r\nthose which de Martius knew well are Brazilian.[2166] Drude,[2167] who\r\nhas studied the Palmaceæ, has written a paper to show that each genus of\r\nthis family is proper to the ancient or to the new world, excepting the\r\ngenus Elæis, and even here he suspects a transport of the _E.\r\nguineensis_ from America into Africa, which is not at all probable. (See\r\nabove, p. 429.) The force of this argument is somewhat diminished by the\r\ncircumstance that _Cocos nucifera_ is a tree which grows on the littoral\r\nand in damp places, while the other species live under different\r\nconditions, frequently far from the sea and from rivers. Maritime\r\nplants, and those which grow in marshes or damp places, have commonly a\r\nmore vast habitation than others of the same genus.\r\n\r\n2. The trade winds of the Pacific, to the south and yet more to the\r\nnorth of the equator, drive floating bodies from America to Asia, a\r\ndirection contrary to that of the general currents.[2168] It is known,\r\nmoreover, from the unexpected arrival of bottles containing papers on\r\ndifferent coasts, that chance has much to do with these transports.\r\n\r\nThe arguments in favour of an Asiatic, or contrary to an American\r\norigin, are the following:—\r\n\r\n1. A current between the third and fifth parallels, north latitude,\r\nflows from the islands of the Indian Archipelago to Panama.[2169] To the\r\nnorth and south of this are currents which take the opposite direction,\r\nbut they start from regions too cold for the cocoa-nut, and do not touch\r\nCentral America, where it is supposed to have been long indigenous.\r\n\r\n2. The inhabitants of the islands of Asia were far bolder navigators\r\nthan the American Indians. It is very possible that canoes from the\r\nAsiatic Islands, containing a provision of cocoa-nuts, were thrown by\r\ntempests or false manœuvres on to the islands or the west coast of\r\nAmerica. The converse is highly improbable.\r\n\r\n3. The area for three centuries has been much vaster in Asia than in\r\nAmerica, and the difference was yet more considerable before that epoch,\r\nfor we know that the cocoa-nut has not long existed in the east of\r\ntropical America.\r\n\r\n4. The inhabitants of the islands of Asia possess an immense number of\r\nvarieties of this tree, which points to a very ancient cultivation.\r\nBlume, in his _Rumphia_, enumerates eighteen varieties in Java and the\r\nadjacent islands, and thirty-nine in the Philippines. Nothing similar\r\nhas been observed in America.\r\n\r\n5. The uses of the cocoa-nut are more varied and more habitual in Asia.\r\nThe natives of America hardly utilize it except for the contents of the\r\nnut, from which they do not extract the oil.\r\n\r\n6. The common names, very numerous and original in Asia, as we shall\r\npresently see, are rare, and often of European origin in America.\r\n\r\n7. It is not probable that the ancient Mexicans and inhabitants of\r\nCentral America would have neglected to spread the cocoa-nut in several\r\ndirections, had it existed among them from a very remote epoch. The\r\ntrifling breadth of the Isthmus of Panama would have facilitated the\r\ntransport from one coast to the other, and the species would soon have\r\nbeen established in the West Indies, at Guiana, etc., as it has become\r\nnaturalized in Jamaica, Antigua,[2170] and elsewhere, since the\r\ndiscovery of America.\r\n\r\n8. If the cocoa-nut in America dated from a geological epoch more\r\nancient than the pleiocene or even eocene deposits in Europe, it would\r\nprobably have been found on both coasts, and the islands to the east and\r\nwest equally.\r\n\r\n9. We cannot find any ancient date of the existence of the cocoa-nut in\r\nAmerica, but its presence in Asia three or four thousand years ago is\r\nproved by several Sanskrit names. Piddington in his index only quotes\r\none, _narikela_. It is the most certain, since it recurs in modern\r\nIndian languages. Scholars count ten of these, which, according to their\r\nmeaning, seem to apply to the species or its fruit.[2171] _Narikela_ has\r\npassed with modifications into Arabic and Persian.[2172] It is even\r\nfound at Otahiti in the form _ari_ or _haari_,[2173] together with a\r\nMalay name.\r\n\r\n10. The Malays have a name widely diffused in the archipelago—_kalâpa_.\r\n_klâpa_, _klôpo_. At Sumatra and Nicobar we find the name _njîor_,\r\n_nicor_; in the Philippines, _niog_; at Bali, _niuh_, _njo_; at Tahiti,\r\n_niuh_; and in other islands, _nu_, _nidju_, _ni_; even at Madagascar,\r\n_wua-niu_.[2174] The Chinese have _ye_, or _ye-tsu_ (the tree is _ye_).\r\nWith the principal Sanskrit name this constitutes four different roots,\r\nwhich show an ancient existence in Asia. However, the uniformity of\r\nnomenclature in the archipelago as far as Tahiti and Madagascar\r\nindicates a transport by human agency since the existence of known\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese name means head of the king of Yuë, referring to an absurd\r\nlegend of which Dr. Bretschneider speaks.[2175] This savant tells us\r\nthat the first mention of the cocoa-nut occurs in a poem of the second\r\ncentury before Christ, but the most unmistakable descriptions are in\r\nworks later than the ninth century of our era. It is true that the\r\nancient writers scarcely knew the south of China, the only part of the\r\nempire where the cocoa-nut palm can live.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the Sanskrit names, the existence of the cocoa-nut in\r\nCeylon, where it is well established on the coast, dates from an almost\r\nhistorical epoch. Near Point de Galle, Seemann tells us may be seen\r\ncarved upon a rock the figure of a native prince, Kotah Raya, to whom is\r\nattributed the discovery of the uses of the cocoa-nut, unknown before\r\nhim; and the earliest chronicle of Ceylon, the _Marawansa_, does not\r\nmention this tree, although it carefully reports the fruits imported by\r\ndifferent princes. It is also noteworthy that the ancient Greeks and\r\nEgyptians only knew the cocoa-nut at a late epoch as an Indian\r\ncuriosity. Apollonius of Tyana saw this palm in Hindustan, at the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era.[2176]\r\n\r\nFrom these facts the most ancient habitation in Asia would be in the\r\narchipelago, rather than on the continent or in Ceylon; and in America\r\nin the islands west of Panama. What are we to think of this varied and\r\ncontradictory evidence? I formerly thought that the arguments in favour\r\nof Western America were the strongest. Now, with more information and\r\ngreater experience in similar questions, I incline to the idea of an\r\norigin in the Indian Archipelago. The extension towards China, Ceylon,\r\nand India dates from not more than three thousand or four thousand years\r\nago, but the transport by sea to the coasts of America and Africa took\r\nplace perhaps in a more remote epoch, although posterior to those epochs\r\nwhen the geographical and physical conditions were different to those of\r\nour day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nSummary and Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nGENERAL TABLE OF SPECIES, WITH THEIR ORIGIN AND THE EPOCH OF THEIR\r\nEARLIEST CULTIVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following table includes a few species of which a detailed account\r\nhas not been given, because their origin is well known, and they are of\r\nlittle importance.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the signs used in the table: (1) annual, (2) biennial,\r\n[Z] perennial, ['5] small shrub, [/5] shrub, [5] small tree, [F5] tree.\r\nThe letters indicate the certain or probable date of earliest\r\ncultivation. For the species of the old world: A, a species cultivated\r\nfor more than four thousand years (according to ancient historians, the\r\nmonuments of ancient Egypt, Chinese works, and botanical and\r\nphilological indications); B, cultivated for more than two thousand\r\nyears (indicated in Theophrastus, found among lacustrine remains, or\r\npresenting various signs, such as possessing Hebrew or Sanskrit names);\r\nC, cultivated for less than two thousand years (mentioned by Dioscorides\r\nand not by Theophrastus, seen in the frescoes at Pompeii, introduced at\r\na known date, etc.). For American species: D, cultivation very ancient\r\nin America (from its wide area and number of varieties); E, species\r\ncultivated before the discovery of America, without showing signs of a\r\ngreat antiquity of culture; F, species only cultivated since the\r\ndiscovery of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              GENERAL TABLE OF SPECIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SPECIES NATIVE TO THE OLD WORLD.\r\n\r\n                         CULTIVATED FOR THE SUBTERRANEAN PARTS.\r\n\r\n   ──────────────────────────────────────┬──────┬───────────────────────────────────\r\n            Name and duration.           │Date. │          Origin.\r\n   ──────────────────────────────────────┼──────┼───────────────────────────────────\r\n   +Radish+—Raphanus sativus (1).        │  B.  │ Temperate Asia.[2177]\r\n   +Horse-Radish+—Cochlearia Armoracia,  │  C.  │ Eastern temperate Europe,\r\n     [Z].                                │      │\r\n   +Turnip+—Brassica Rapa (2).           │  A.  │ Europe, western Siberia (?).\r\n   +Rape+—Brassica Napus (2).            │  A.  │ Europe, western Siberia (?).\r\n   +Carrot+—Daucus Carota (2).           │  B.  │ Europe, western temperate\r\n                                         │      │   Asia (?).\r\n   +Parsnip+—Pastinaca sativa (2).       │  C.  │ Central and southern Europe.\r\n   +Tuberous Chervil+—Chærophyllum       │  C.  │ Central Europe, Caucasus.\r\n     bulbosum (2).                       │      │\r\n   +Skirret+—Sium Sisarum, [Z].          │  C.  │ Altaic Siberia, northern\r\n                                         │      │   Persia.\r\n   +Madder+—Rubia tinctorum, [Z]         │  B.  │ Western temperate Asia,\r\n                                         │      │   south-east of Europe.\r\n   +Salsify+—Tragopogon porrifolium (2). │C.(?) │ South-east of Europe,\r\n                                         │      │   Algeria.\r\n   +Scorzonera+—Scorzonera hispanica.    │  C.  │ South-west of Europe, south\r\n                                         │      │   of the Caucasus.\r\n   +Rampion+—Campanula Rapunculus (2).   │  C.  │ Temperate and southern\r\n                                         │      │   Europe.\r\n                              {Vegetable.│  B.  │ Canaries, Mediterranean\r\n                              {          │      │   basin, western temperate\r\n   +Beet+—Beta vulg.

II.\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Article I._—+Regions where Cultivated Plants originated.+\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the nineteenth century, the origin of most of our\r\ncultivated species was unknown. Linnæus made no efforts to discover it,\r\nand subsequent authors merely copied the vague or erroneous expressions\r\nby which he indicated their habitations. Alexander von Humboldt\r\nexpressed the true state of the science in 1807, when he said, “The\r\norigin, the first home of the plants most useful to man, and which have\r\naccompanied him from the remotest epochs, is a secret as impenetrable as\r\nthe dwelling of all our domestic animals.... We do not know what region\r\nproduced spontaneously wheat, barley, oats, and rye. The plants which\r\nconstitute the natural riches of all the inhabitants of the tropics, the\r\nbanana, the papaw, the manioc, and maize, have never been found in a\r\nwild state. The potato presents the same phenomenon.”[2178]\r\n\r\nAt the present day, if a few cultivated species have not yet been seen\r\nin a wild state, this is not the case with the immense majority. We know\r\nat least, most frequently, from what country they first came. This was\r\nalready the result of my work of 1855, which modern more extensive\r\nresearch has confirmed in almost all points. This research has been\r\napplied to 247 species,[2179] cultivated on a large scale by\r\nagriculturists, or in kitchen gardens and orchards. I might have added a\r\nfew rarely cultivated or but little known, or of which the cultivation\r\nhas been abandoned; but the statistical results would be essentially the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nOut of the 247 species which I have studied, the old world has furnished\r\n199, America 45, and three are still uncertain.\r\n\r\nNo species was common to the tropical and austral regions of the two\r\nhemispheres before cultivation. _Allium schœnoprasum_, the hop (_Humulus\r\nlupulus_), the strawberry (_Fragaria visca_), the currant (_Ribes\r\nrubrum_), the chestnut (_Castanea vulgaris_), and the mushroom\r\n(_Agaricus campestris_), were common to the northern regions of the old\r\nand new worlds. I have reckoned them among the species of the old world,\r\nsince their principal habitation is there, and there they were first\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\nA great number of species originated at once in Europe and Western Asia,\r\nin Europe and Siberia, in the Mediterranean basin and Western Asia, in\r\nIndia and the Asiatic archipelago, in the West Indies and Mexico, in\r\nthese two regions and Columbia, in Peru and Brazil, or in Peru and\r\nColumbia, etc., etc. They may be counted in the table. This is a proof\r\nof the impossibility of subdividing the continents and of classing the\r\nislands in well-defined natural regions. Whatever be the method of\r\ndivision, there will always be species common to two, three, four, or\r\nmore regions, and others confined to a small portion of a single\r\ncountry. The same facts may be observed in the case of uncultivated\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy fact is the absence in some countries of indigenous\r\ncultivated plants. For instance, we have none from the Arctic or\r\nAntarctic regions, where, it is true, the floras consist of but few\r\nspecies. The United States, in spite of their vast territory, which will\r\nsoon support hundreds of millions of inhabitants, only yields, as\r\nnutritious plants worth cultivating, the Jerusalem artichoke and the\r\ngourds. _Zizana aquatica_, which the natives gathered wild, is a grass\r\ntoo inferior to our cereals and to rice to make it worth the trouble of\r\nplanting it. They had a few bulbs and edible berries, but they have not\r\ntried to cultivate them, having early received the maize, which was\r\nworth far more.\r\n\r\nPatagonia and the Cape have not furnished a single species. Australia\r\nand New Zealand have furnished one tree, _Eucalyptus globulus_, and a\r\nvegetable, not very nutritious, the _Tetragonia_. Their floras were\r\nentirely wanting in graminæ similar to the cereals, in leguminous plants\r\nwith edible seeds, in Cruciferæ with fleshy roots.[2180] In the moist\r\ntropical region of Australia, rice and _Alocasia macrorhiza_ have been\r\nfound wild, or perhaps naturalized, but the greater part of the country\r\nsuffers too much from drought to allow these species to become widely\r\ndiffused.\r\n\r\nIn general, the austral regions had very few annuals, and among their\r\nrestricted number none offered evident advantages. Now annual species\r\nare the easiest to cultivate. They have played a great part in the\r\nancient agriculture of other countries.\r\n\r\nIn short, the original distribution of cultivated species was very\r\nunequal. It had no proportion with the needs of man or the extent of\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Article II._—+Number and Nature of Cultivated Species at Different\r\nEpochs.+\r\n\r\nThe species marked A in the table on pp. 437-446 must be regarded as of\r\nvery ancient cultivation. They are forty-four in number. Some of the\r\nspecies marked B are probably as ancient, though it is impossible to\r\nprove it. The five American species marked D are probably cultivated as\r\nearly as those in the category C, or the most ancient in the category B.\r\n\r\nAs might be supposed, the species A are especially plants provided with\r\nroots, seeds, and fruits proper for the food of man. Afterwards come a\r\nfew species having fruits agreeable to the taste, or textile,\r\ntinctorial, oil-producing plants, or yielding stimulating drinks by\r\ninfusion or fermentation. There are among these only two green\r\nvegetables, and no fodder. The orders which predominate are the\r\nCruciferæ, Leguminosæ, and Graminaceæ.\r\n\r\nThe number of annuals is twenty-two out of the forty-four, or fifty per\r\ncent. Out of five American species marked D, two are annuals. In the\r\ncategory A, there are two biennials, and D has none. Among all the\r\nPhanerogams the annuals are not more than fifty per cent., and the\r\nbiennials one or at most two per cent. It is clear that at the beginning\r\nof civilization plants which yield an immediate return are most prized.\r\nThey offer, moreover, this advantage, that their cultivation is easily\r\ndiffused or increased, either because of the abundance of seed, or the\r\nsame species may be grown in summer in the north, and in winter or all\r\nthe year round in the tropics.\r\n\r\nHerbaceous perennial plants are rare in categories A and D. They are\r\nonly from two to four per cent., unless we include _Brassica oleracea_,\r\nand the variety of flax which is usually perennial (_L. angustifolium_),\r\ncultivated by the Swiss lake-dwellers. In nature herbaceous perennials\r\nconstitute about forty per cent. of the Phanerogams.[2181]\r\n\r\nA and D include twenty ligneous species out of forty-nine, that is about\r\nforty-one per cent. They are in the proportion of forty-three per cent.\r\nof the Phanerogams.\r\n\r\nThus the earliest husbandmen employed chiefly annuals or biennials,\r\nrather fewer woody species, and far fewer herbaceous perennials. These\r\ndifferences are due to the relative facility of cultivation, and the\r\nproportion of the evidently useful species in each division.\r\n\r\nThe species of the old world marked B have been in cultivation for more\r\nthan two thousand years, but perhaps some of them belong to category A.\r\nThe American species marked E were cultivated before the discoveries of\r\nColumbus, perhaps for more than two thousand years. Many other species\r\nmarked (?) in the table date probably from an ancient epoch, but as they\r\nchiefly exist in countries without a literature and without\r\narchæological records we do not know their history. It is useless to\r\ninsist upon such doubtful categories; on the other hand, the plants\r\nwhich we know to have been first cultivated in the old world less than\r\ntwo thousand years ago, and in America since its discovery, may be\r\ncompared with plants of ancient cultivation.\r\n\r\nThese species of modern cultivation number sixty-one in the old world,\r\nmarked C, and six in America, marked F; sixty-seven in all.\r\n\r\nClassed according to their duration, they number thirty-seven per cent.\r\nannuals, seven to eight per cent. biennials, thirty-three per cent.\r\nherbaceous perennials, and twenty-two to twenty-three per cent. woody\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of annuals or biennials is also here larger than in the\r\nwhole number of plants, but it is not so large as among species of very\r\nancient cultivation. The proportions of perennials and woody species are\r\nless than in the whole vegetable kingdom, but they are higher than among\r\nthe species A, of very ancient cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe plants cultivated for less than two thousand years are chiefly\r\nartificial fodders, which the ancients scarcely knew; then bulbs,\r\nvegetables, medicinal plants (Cinchonas); plants with edible fruits, or\r\nnutritious seeds (buckwheats) or aromatic seeds (coffee).\r\n\r\nMen have not discovered and cultivated within the last two thousand\r\nyears a single species which can rival maize, rice, the sweet potato,\r\nthe potato, the bread-fruit, the date, cereals, millets, sorghums, the\r\nbanana, soy. These date from three, four, or five thousand years,\r\nperhaps even in some cases six thousand years. The species first\r\ncultivated during the Græco-Roman civilization and later nearly all\r\nanswer to more varied or more refined needs. A great dispersion of the\r\nancient species from one country to another took place, and at the same\r\ntime a selection of the best varieties developed in each species. The\r\nintroductions within the last two thousand years took place in a very\r\nirregular and intermittent manner. I cannot quote a single species\r\ncultivated for the first time after that date by the Chinese, the great\r\ncultivators of ancient times. The peoples of Southern and Western Asia\r\ninnovated in a certain degree by cultivating the buckwheats, several\r\ncucurbitaceæ, a few alliums, etc. In Europe, the Romans and several\r\npeoples in the Middle Ages introduced the cultivation of a few\r\nvegetables and fruits, and that of several fodders. In Africa a few\r\nspecies were then first cultivated separately. After the voyages of\r\nVasco di Gama and of Columbus a rapid diffusion took place of the\r\nspecies already cultivated in either hemisphere. These transports\r\ncontinued during three centuries without any introduction of new species\r\ninto cultivation. In the two or three hundred years which preceded the\r\ndiscovery of America, and the two hundred which followed, the number of\r\ncultivated species remained almost stationary. The American\r\nstrawberries, _Diospyros virginiana_, sea-kale, and _Tetragonia expansa_\r\nintroduced in the eighteenth century, have but little importance. We\r\nmust come to the middle of the present century to find new cultures of\r\nany value from the utilitarian point of view, such as _Eucalyptus\r\nglobulus_ of Australia and the _Cinchonas_ of South America.\r\n\r\nThe mode of introduction of the latter species shows the great change\r\nwhich has taken place in the means of transport. Previously the\r\ncultivation of a plant began in the country where it existed, whereas\r\nthe Australian Eucalyptus was first planted and sown in Algeria, and the\r\nCinchonas of America in the south of Asia. Up to our own day botanical\r\nor private gardens had only diffused species already cultivated\r\nsomewhere; now they introduce absolutely new cultures. The royal garden\r\nat Kew is distinguished in this respect, and other botanical gardens and\r\nacclimatization societies in England and elsewhere are making similar\r\nattempts. It is probable that tropical countries will greatly profit by\r\nthis in the course of a century. Others will also find their advantage\r\nfrom the growing facility in the transport of commodities.\r\n\r\nWhen a species has been once cultivated, it is rarely, perhaps never\r\ncompletely, abandoned. It continues to be here and there cultivated in\r\nbackward countries, or those whose climate is especially favourable. I\r\nhave passed over some of these species which are nearly abandoned, such\r\nas dyer’s woad (_Isatis tinctoria_), mallow (_Malva sylvestris_), a\r\nvegetable used by the Romans, and certain medicinal plants formerly much\r\nused, such as fennel, cummin, etc., but it is certain that they are\r\nstill grown in some places.\r\n\r\nThe competition of species causes the cultivation of some to diminish,\r\nof others to increase; besides, vegetable dyes and medicinal plants are\r\nrivalled by the discoveries of chemists. Woad, madder, indigo, mint, and\r\nseveral simples must give way before the invasion of chemical products.\r\nIt is possible that men may succeed in making oil, sugar, and flour, as\r\nhoney, butter, and jellies are already made, without employing organic\r\nsubstances. Nothing, for instance, would more completely change\r\nagricultural conditions than the manufacture of flour from its known\r\ninorganic elements. In the actual state of science, there are still\r\nproducts which will be more and more required of the vegetable kingdom;\r\nthese are textile substances, tan, indiarubber, gutta-percha, and\r\ncertain spices. As the forests where these are found are gradually\r\ndestroyed, and these substances are at the same time more in demand,\r\nthere will be the greater inducement to cultivate certain species.\r\n\r\nThese usually belong to tropical countries. It is in these regions also,\r\nparticularly in South America, that fruit trees will be more\r\ncultivated—those of the order Anonaceæ for instance, of which the\r\nnatives and botanists already recognize the value. Probably the number\r\nof plants suitable for fodder, and of forest trees which can live in hot\r\ndry countries, will be increased. The additions will not be numerous in\r\ntemperate climates, nor especially in cold regions.\r\n\r\nFrom these data and reflections it is probable that at the end of the\r\nnineteenth century men will cultivate on a large scale and for use about\r\nthree hundred species. This is a small proportion of the one hundred and\r\ntwenty or one hundred and forty thousand in the vegetable kingdom; but\r\nin the animal world the proportion of creatures subject to the will of\r\nman is far smaller. There are not perhaps more than two hundred species\r\nof domestic animals—that is, reared for our use,—and the animal kingdom\r\nreckons millions of species. In the great class of molluscs the oyster\r\nalone is cultivated, and in that of the Articulata, which counts ten\r\ntimes more species than the vegetable kingdom, we can only name the bee\r\nand two or three silk-producing insects. Doubtless the number of species\r\nof animals and vegetables which may be reared or cultivated for pleasure\r\nor curiosity is very large: witness menageries and zoological and\r\nbotanical gardens, but I am only speaking here of useful plants and\r\nanimals, in general and customary employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Article III._—+Cultivated Plants known or not known in a Wild State.+\r\n\r\nScience has succeeded in discovering the geographical origin of nearly\r\nall cultivated species; but there is less progress in the knowledge of\r\nspecies in a natural state—that is wild, far from cultivation and\r\ndwellings. There are species which have not been discovered in this\r\ncondition, and others whose specific identity and truly wild condition\r\nare doubtful.\r\n\r\nIn the following enumeration I have classed the species according to the\r\ndegree of certainty as to the wild character, and the nature of the\r\ndoubts where such exist.[2182]\r\n\r\n1. Spontaneous species, that is wild, seen by several botanists far from\r\ndwellings and cultivation, with every appearance of indigenous plants,\r\nand under a form identical with one of the cultivated varieties. These\r\nare the species which are not enumerated below; they are 169 in number.\r\n\r\nAmong these 169 species, 31 belong to the categories A and D, of very\r\nancient cultivation, 56 have been in cultivation less than two thousand\r\nyears, C, and the others are of modern or unknown date.\r\n\r\n2. Seen and gathered in the same conditions, but by a single botanist in\r\na single locality. Three species.\r\n\r\nCucurbita maxima, _Faba vulgaris_, _Nicotiana Tabacum_.\r\n\r\n3. Seen and mentioned but not gathered in the same conditions by one or\r\ntwo authors and botanists, more or less ancient, who may have been\r\nmistaken. Two species.\r\n\r\n_Carthamus tinctorius_, _Triticum vulgare_.\r\n\r\n4. Gathered wild by botanists in several localities under a form\r\nslightly different to those which are cultivated, but which most authors\r\nhave no hesitation in classing with the species. Four species.\r\n\r\n_Olea europæa_, _Oryza sativa_, Solanum tuberosum, _Vitis vinifera_.\r\n\r\n5. Wild, gathered by botanists in several localities under forms\r\nconsidered by some botanists as constituting different species, while\r\nothers treat them as varieties. Fifteen species.\r\n\r\nAllium ampeloprasum porrum, Cichorium Endivia, var., _Crocus sativus,\r\nvar._, *Cucumis melo, Cucurbita Pepo, Helianthus tuberosus, Latuca\r\nscariola sativa, _Linum usitatissimum annuum_, Lycopersicum esculentium,\r\nPapaver somniferum, Pyrus nivalis var., *Ribes grossularia, Solanum\r\nMelongena, *Spinacia oleracea var., Triticum monococcum.\r\n\r\n6. Subspontaneous, that is half-wild, similar to one or other of the\r\ncultivated forms, but possibly plants escaped from cultivation, judging\r\nfrom the locality. Twenty-four species.\r\n\r\nAgava americana, Amarantus gangeticus, _Amygdalus persica_, Areca\r\ncatechu, *Avena orientalis, Avena sativa, *Cajanus indicus, _Cicer\r\narietinum_, Citrus decumana, Cucurbita moschata, Dioscorea japonica,\r\nErvum Ervilia, _Ervum lens_, Fagopyrum emarginatum, Gossypium\r\nbarbadense, Holcus saccharatus, _Holcus sorghum_, Indigofera tinctoria,\r\nLepidum sativum, Maranta arundinacea, Nicotiana rustica, _Panicum\r\nmiliaceum_, Raphanus sativus, Spergula arvensis.\r\n\r\n7. Subspontaneous like the preceding, but different enough from the\r\ncultivated varieties to lead the majority of authors to regard them as\r\ndistinct species. Three species.\r\n\r\n*Allium ascalonicum (variety of _A. cepa_?), Allium scorodoprasum\r\n(variety of A. sativum?), Secale cereale (variety of one of the\r\nperennial species of Secale?).\r\n\r\n8. Not discovered in a wild state nor even half-wild, derived perhaps\r\nfrom cultivated species at the beginning of agriculture, but too\r\ndifferent not to be commonly regarded as distinct species. Three\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_Hordeum hexastichon_ (derived from _H. distichon_?), _Hordeum vulgare_\r\n(derived from _H. distichon_?), _Triticum spelta_ (derived from _T.\r\nvulgare_?)\r\n\r\n9. Not discovered in a wild state nor even half-wild, but originating in\r\ncountries which are not completely explored, and belonging perhaps to\r\nlittle-known wild species of these countries. Six species.\r\n\r\nArachis hypogea, Carophyllus aromaticus, _Convolvulus batatas_,\r\n*Dolichos lubia, Manihot utilissima, Phaseolus vulgaris.\r\n\r\n10. Not found in a wild state, nor even half-wild, but originating in\r\ncountries which are not sufficiently explored, or in similar countries\r\nwhich cannot be defined, more different than the latter from known wild\r\nspecies. Eighteen species.\r\n\r\nAmorphophallus konjak, Arracacha esculenta, Brassica chinensis, Capsicum\r\nannuum, Chenopodium quinoa,[2183] Citrus nobilis, Cucurbita ficifolia,\r\nDioscorea alata, Dioscorea Batatas, Dioscorea sativa, Eleusine coracana,\r\nLucuma mammosa, Nephelium Litchi, *Pisum sativum, Saccharum officinarum,\r\nSechium edule, *Tricosanthes anguina, _Zea mays_.\r\n\r\nTotal 247 species.\r\n\r\nThese figures show that there are 193 species known to be wild, 27\r\ndoubtful, as half-wild, and 27 not found wild.\r\n\r\nI believe that these last will be found some time or other, if not under\r\none of the cultivated forms, at least in an allied form called species\r\nor variety according to the author. To attain this result tropical\r\ncountries will have to be more thoroughly explored, collectors must be\r\nmore attentive to localities, and more floras must be published of\r\ncountries now little known, and good monographs of certain genera based\r\nupon the characters which vary least in cultivation.\r\n\r\nA few species having their origin in countries fairly well explored, and\r\nwhich it is impossible to confound with others because each is unique in\r\nits genus, have not been found wild, or only once, which leads us to\r\nsuppose that they are extinct in nature, or rapidly becoming so. I\r\nallude to maize and the bean (see pp. 387 and 316). I mention also in\r\nArticle IV. other plants which appear to be becoming extinct in the\r\nlast few thousand years. These last belong to genera which contain many\r\nspecies, which renders the hypothesis less probable;[2184] but, on the\r\nother hand, they are rarely seen at a distance from cultivated ground,\r\nand they hardly ever become naturalized, that is wild, which shows a\r\ncertain feebleness or a tendency to become the prey of animals and\r\nparasites.\r\n\r\nThe 67 species cultivated for less than two thousand years (C, F) are\r\nall found wild, except the species marked with an asterisk, which have\r\nnot been found or which are subject to doubts. This is a proportion of\r\neighty-three per cent.\r\n\r\nWhat is more remarkable is that the great majority of species cultivated\r\nfor more than four thousand years (A), or in America for three thousand\r\nor four thousand years (D), still exist wild in a form identical with\r\nsome one of the cultivated varieties. Their number is thirty-one out of\r\nforty-nine, or sixty-three per cent. In categories 9 and 10 there are\r\nonly two of these species of very ancient cultivation, or four per\r\ncent., and these are two species which probably exist no longer as wild\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nI believed, _à priori_, that a great number of the species cultivated\r\nfor more than four thousand years would have altered from their original\r\ncondition to such a degree that they could no longer be recognized among\r\nwild plants. It appears, on the contrary, that the forms anterior to\r\ncultivation have commonly remained side by side with those which\r\ncultivators employed and propagated from century to century. This may be\r\nexplained in two ways: 1. The period of four thousand years is short\r\ncompared to the duration of most of the specific forms in phanerogamous\r\nplants. 2. The cultivated species receive, outside of cultivated ground,\r\ncontinual reinforcements from the seeds which man, birds, and different\r\nnatural agents disperse and transport in a thousand ways.\r\nNaturalizations produced in this manner often confound the wild plants\r\nwith the cultivated ones, and the more easily that they fertilize each\r\nother since they belong to the same species. This fact is clearly\r\ndemonstrated in the case of a plant of the old world cultivated in\r\nAmerica, in gardens, and which, later, becomes naturalized on a large\r\nscale in the open country or the woods, like the cardoon at Buenos\r\nAyres, and the oranges in several American countries. Cultivation widens\r\nareas, and supplements the deficits which the natural reproduction of\r\nthe species may present. There are, however, a few exceptions, which are\r\nworth mentioning in a separate article.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Article IV._—+Cultivated Plants which are Extinct, or becoming Extinct\r\nin a Wild State.+\r\n\r\nThese species to which I allude present three remarkable characters:—\r\n\r\n1. They have not been found wild, or only once or twice, and often\r\ndoubtfully, although the regions whence they come have been visited by\r\nseveral botanists.\r\n\r\n2. They have not the faculty of sowing themselves, and propagating\r\nindefinitely outside cultivated ground. In other terms, in such cases\r\nthey do not pass out of the condition of adventitious plants.\r\n\r\n3. It cannot be supposed that they are derived within historic times\r\nfrom certain allied species.\r\n\r\nThese three characters are found united in the following species:—Bean\r\n(_Faba vulgaris_), chick-pea (_Cicer arietinum_), ervilla (_Ervum\r\nErvilia_), lentil (_Ervum lens_), tobacco (_Nicotiana tabacum_), wheat\r\n(_Triticum vulgare_), maize (_Zea mays_). The sweet potato (_Convolvulus\r\nbatatas_) should be added if the kindred species were better known to be\r\ndistinct, and the carthamine (_Carthamus tinctorius_) if the interior of\r\nArabia had been explored, and we had not found a mention of the plant in\r\nan Arabian author.\r\n\r\nAll these species, and probably others of little-known countries or\r\ngenera, appear to be extinct or on their way to become so. Supposing\r\nthey ceased to be cultivated, they would disappear, whereas the majority\r\nof cultivated plants have become somewhere naturalized, and would\r\npersist in a wild state.\r\n\r\nThe seven species mentioned just now, excepting tobacco, have seeds full\r\nof fecula, which are the food of birds, rodents, and different insects,\r\nand have not the power of passing entire through their alimentary canal.\r\nThis is probably the sole or principal cause of their inferiority in the\r\nstruggle for existence.\r\n\r\nThus my researches into cultivated plants show that certain species are\r\nextinct or becoming extinct since the historical epoch, and that not in\r\nsmall islands but on vast continents without any great modifications of\r\nclimate. This is an important result for the history of all organic\r\nbeings in all epochs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Article V._—+Concluding Remarks.+\r\n\r\n1. Cultivated plants do not belong to any particular category, for they\r\nbelong to fifty-one different families. They are, however, all\r\nphanerogamous except the mushroom (_Agaricus campestris_).\r\n\r\n2. The characters which have most varied in cultivation are, beginning\r\nwith the most variable: _a._ The size, form, and colour of the fleshy\r\nparts, whatever organ they belong to (root, bulb, tubercle, fruit, or\r\nseed), and the abundance of fecula, sugar, and other substances which\r\nare contained in these parts; _b._ The number of seeds, which is often\r\nin inverse ratio to the development of the fleshy parts of the plant;\r\n_c._ The form, size, or pubescence of the floral organs which persist\r\nround the fruits or seeds; _d._ The rapidity of the phenomena of\r\nvegetation—whence often results the quality of ligneous or herbaceous\r\nplants, and of perennial, biennial, or annual.\r\n\r\nThe stems, leaves, and flowers vary little in plants cultivated for\r\nthose organs. The last formations of each yearly or biennial growth vary\r\nmost; in other terms, the results of vegetation vary more than the\r\norgans which cause vegetation.\r\n\r\n3. I have not observed the slightest indication of an adaptation to\r\ncold. When the cultivation of a species advances towards the north\r\n(maize, flax, tobacco, etc.), it is explained by the production of\r\nearly varieties, which can ripen before the cold season, or by the\r\ncustom of cultivating in the north, in summer, the species which in the\r\nsouth are sown in winter. The study of the northern limits of wild\r\nspecies had formerly led me to the same conclusion, for they have not\r\nchanged within historic times although the seeds are carried frequently\r\nand continually to the north of each limit. Periods of more than four or\r\nfive thousand years, or changements of form and duration, are needed\r\napparently to produce a modification in a plant which will allow it to\r\nsupport a greater degree of cold.\r\n\r\n4. The classification of varieties made by agriculturists and gardeners\r\nare generally based on those characters which vary most (form, size,\r\ncolour, taste of the fleshy parts, beard in the ears of corn, etc.).\r\nBotanists are mistaken when they follow this example; they should\r\nconsult those more fixed characters of the organs for the sake of which\r\nthe species are not cultivated.\r\n\r\n5. A non-cultivated species being a group of more or less similar forms,\r\namong which subordinate groups may often be distinguished (races,\r\nvarieties, sub-varieties), it may have happened that two or more of\r\nthese slightly differing forms may have been introduced into\r\ncultivation. This must have been the case especially when the habitation\r\nof a species is extensive, and yet more when it is disjunctive. The\r\nfirst case is probably that of the cabbage (_Brassica_), of flax,\r\nbird-cherry (_Prunus avium_), the common pear, etc. The second is\r\nprobably that of the gourd, the melon, and trefoil haricot, which\r\nexisted previous to cultivation both in India and Africa.\r\n\r\n6. No distinctive character is known between a naturalized plant which\r\narose several generations back from a cultivated plant, and a wild plant\r\nsprung from plants which have always been wild. In any case, in the\r\ntransition from cultivated plant to wild plant, the particular features\r\nwhich are propagated by grafting are not preserved by seedlings. For\r\ninstance, the olive tree which has become wild is the _oleaster_, the\r\npear bears smaller fruits, the Spanish chestnut yields a common fruit.\r\nFor the rest, the forms naturalized from cultivated species have not yet\r\nbeen sufficiently observed from generation to generation. M. Sagot has\r\ndone this for the vine. It would be interesting to compare in the same\r\nmanner with their cultivated forms Citrus, Persica, and the cardoon,\r\nnaturalized in America, far from their original home, as also the Agave\r\nand the prickly pear, wild in America, with their naturalized varieties\r\nin the old world. We should know exactly what persists after a temporary\r\nstate of cultivation.\r\n\r\n7. A species may have had, previous to cultivation, a restricted\r\nhabitation, and subsequently occupy an immense area as a cultivated and\r\nsometimes a naturalized plant.\r\n\r\n8. In the history of cultivated plants, I have noticed no trace of\r\ncommunication between the peoples of the old and new worlds before the\r\ndiscovery of America by Columbus. The Scandinavians, who had pushed\r\ntheir excursions as far as the north of the United States, and the\r\nBasques of the Middle Ages, who followed whales perhaps as far as\r\nAmerica, do not seem to have transported a single cultivated species.\r\nNeither has the Gulf Stream produced any effect. Between America and\r\nAsia two transports of useful plants perhaps took place, the one by man\r\n(the Batata, or sweet potato) the other by the agency of man or of the\r\nsea (the cocoa-nut palm).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Hooker, _Flora Tasmaniæ_, i. p. cx.\r\n\r\n[2] Bretschneider, _On the Study and Value of Chinese Botanical Works_,\r\np. 7.\r\n\r\n[3] De Naidaillac, _Les Premiers Hommes et les Temps Préhistoriques_, i.\r\npp. 266, 268.

Scholars find a greater number of\r\nwords in the texts, but they do not give sufficient proof of the sense\r\nof these words. As a rule, we have not in Sanskrit what we have in\r\nHebrew, Greek, and Chinese—a quotation of phrases concerning each word\r\ntranslated into a modern language.\r\n\r\n[22] The best work on the plant-names in the Old Testament is that of\r\nRosenmüller, _Handbuch der biblischen Alterkunde_, in 8vo, vol. iv.,\r\nLeipzig, 1830. A good short work, in French, is _La Botanique de la\r\nBible_, by Fred. Hamilton, in 8vo, Nice, 1871.\r\n\r\n[23] Reynier, a Swiss botanist, who had been in Egypt, has given the\r\nsense of many plant-names in the Talmud. See his volumes entitled\r\n_Économie Publique et Rurale des Arabes et des Juifs_, in 8vo, 1820; and\r\n_Économie Publique et Rurale des Égyptiens et des Carthaginois_, in 8vo,\r\nLausanne, 1823. The more recent works of Duschak and Löw are not based\r\nupon a knowledge of Eastern plants, and are unintelligible to botanists\r\nbecause of names in Syriac and Hebrew characters.\r\n\r\n[24] Adolphe Pictet, _Les Origines des Peuples Indo-Européens_, 3 vols,\r\nin 8vo, Paris, 1878.\r\n\r\n[25] A certain number of species whose origin is well known, such as the\r\ncarrot, sorrel, etc., are mentioned only in the summary at the beginning\r\nof the last part, with an indication of the principal facts concerning\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[26] Some species are cultivated sometimes for their roots and sometimes\r\nfor their leaves or seeds. In other chapters will be found species\r\ncultivated sometimes for their leaves (as fodder) or for their seeds,\r\netc. I have classed them according to their commonest use. The\r\nalphabetical index refers to the place assigned to each species.\r\n\r\n[27] See the young state of the plant when the part of the stem below\r\nthe cotyledons is not yet swelled.

According to\r\nChoisy, it is a variety of the _Batatas edulis_; according to Bentham\r\n(Hook, _Jour. Bot._, v. p. 352), of the _Batatas paniculata_. My\r\nspecimen, which is rather imperfect, seems to me to be different from\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n[171] Clusius, _Hist._, ii. p. 77.\r\n\r\n[172] A. de Candolle, _Géogr. Bot.

The handbook of agriculture of\r\nNung-chang-tsuan-shu, whose author died in 1633, asserts this fact. He\r\nspeaks of a sweet potato wild in China, called _chu_, the cultivated\r\nspecies being _kan-chu_. The _Min-shu_, published in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, says that the introduction took place between 1573 and 1620.\r\nThe American origin thus receives a further proof.\r\n\r\n[174] Moquin-Tandon, in _Prodromus_, vol. xiii. pt. 2, p. 55; Boissier,\r\n_Flora Orientalis_, iv. p. 898; Ledebour, _Fl.

Columbus\r\nhad noticed it at San Salvador and at Cuba; Oviedo mentions it in St.\r\nDomingo and De Lery in Brazil. This is not the testimony of botanists,\r\nbut Nuttall and others found it wild in the upper valley of the\r\nMissouri, in Colorado, and Texas, where, however, from the date, it\r\nmight have been introduced.—AUTHOR’S NOTE, 1884.\r\n\r\n[354] Piddington, _Index to Indian Plants_.\r\n\r\n[355] Nemnich, _Polyglot.

Forskalii_, D. C.\r\n_Syst._, i. p. 472), which was sometimes cultivated in gardens in Egypt\r\nwhen Forskal visited that country; it was called _keschta_, that is,\r\ncoagulated milk. The rarity of its cultivation and the silence of\r\nancient authors shows that it was of modern introduction into Egypt. Ebn\r\nBaithar (Sondtheimer’s German translation, in 2 vols., 1840), an Arabian\r\nphysician of the thirteenth century, mentions no _Anonacea_, nor the\r\nname _keschta_. I do not see that Forskal’s description and illustration\r\n(_Descr._, p. 102. ic. tab. 15) differ from _A. squamosa_. Coquebert’s\r\nspecimen, mentioned in the _Systema_, agrees with Forskal’s plate; but\r\nas it is in flower while the plate shows the fruit, its identity cannot\r\nbe proved.\r\n\r\n[841] Roxburgh, _Fl.

The Chinese believe the oval peaches, which are very red on one\r\nside, to be a symbol of a long life. In consequence of this ancient\r\nbelief, peaches are used in all ornaments in painting and sculpture, and\r\nin congratulatory presents, etc. According to the work of\r\nChin-noug-king, the peach _Yu_ prevents death. If it is not eaten in\r\ntime, it at least preserves the body from decay until the end of the\r\nworld. The peach is always mentioned among the fruits of immortality,\r\nwith which were entertained the hopes of Tsinchi-Hoang, Vouty, of the\r\nHans and other emperors who pretended to immortality, etc.\r\n\r\n[1103] Lindley, _Trans.

Some botanists, purists in spelling,\r\nwrite _pirus_, so that in referring to a modern work it is necessary to\r\nlook in the index for both forms, or run the risk of believing that the\r\npears are not in the work. In any case the ancient name was a common\r\nname; but the true botanical name is that of Linnæus, founder of the\r\nreceived nomenclature, and Linnæus wrote _Pyrus_.\r\n\r\n[1148] Comes, _Ill.

I have not met with it in botanical works earlier than the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century. My manuscript collection of common\r\nnames, among more than forty names for this species in different\r\nlanguages or dialects has not one which resembles it. Buchoz, in his\r\n_Dictionnaire des Plantes, 1770_, i. p. 289, calls the plant the\r\n_Cassis_ or _Cassetier des Poitevins_. The old French name was\r\n_Poivrier_ or _groseillier noir_. Larousse’s dictionary says that good\r\nliqueurs were made at Cassis in Provence. Can this be the origin of the\r\nname?\r\n\r\n[1389] Aitchison, _Catalogue_, p. 86.\r\n\r\n[1390] Lowe, _Man.

The work says (p. 166) that pine-apples do not grow in Peru,\r\nbut that they are brought thither from the Andes, and (p. 173) that the\r\ncacao comes from the Andes. It seems to have meant hot regions. The word\r\nAndes has since been applied to the chain of mountains by a strange and\r\nunfortunate transfer.\r\n\r\n[1548] I have read through the entire work, to make sure of this fact.\r\n\r\n[1549] Prescott, _Conquest of Peru_. The author has consulted valuable\r\nrecords, among others a manuscript of Montesinos of 1527; but he does\r\nnot quote his authorities for each fact, and contents himself with vague\r\nand general indications, which are very insufficient.\r\n\r\n[1550] Marcgraf, _Brasil._, p. 33.\r\n\r\n[1551] Oviedo, Ramusio’s trans., iii. p. 113; Jos.

From the information supplied me at the _ministère\r\nde la guerre_, I learn that de Clieu was a gentleman, and a connection\r\nof the Comte de Maurepas. He was born in Normandy, went into the navy in\r\n1702, and retired in 1760, after a distinguished career. He died in\r\n1775.
