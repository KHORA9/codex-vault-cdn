They exhaust the\r\nnumber of the orthopterous and homopterous insects discussed by Henri\r\nFabre.\r\n\r\nChapters I. to VIII., XV., XVI. and XIX. have already appeared, in\r\ncertain cases under different titles and partly in an abbreviated form,\r\nin an interesting miscellany extracted from the Souvenirs, translated\r\nby Mr. Bernard Miall and published by the Century Company. This volume,\r\nSocial Life in the Insect World, is illustrated with admirable\r\nphotographs of insects, taken from life, and deserves a prominent place\r\non the shelves of every lover of Fabre’s works.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of writing, the only one of the following essays that has\r\nbeen published before, in my translation, is the first of the three\r\ndescribing the White-faced Decticus, which appeared, in the summer of\r\nlast year, in the English Review.\r\n\r\nMiss Frances Rodwell has again lent me the most valuable assistance in\r\npreparing this volume; and I am indebted also to Mr. Osman Edwards and\r\nMr. Stephen McKenna for their graceful rhymed versions of the\r\noccasional lyrics that adorn it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander Teixeira de Mattos.\r\n\r\n\r\nChelsea, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE FABLE OF THE CICADA AND THE ANT\r\n\r\n\r\nFame is built up mainly of legend; in the animal world, as in the world\r\nof men, the story takes precedence of history. Insects in particular,\r\nwhether they attract our attention in this way or in that, have their\r\nfair share in a folk-lore which pays but little regard to truth.\r\n\r\nFor instance, who does not know the Cicada, at least by name? Where, in\r\nthe entomological world, can we find a renown that equals hers? Her\r\nreputation as an inveterate singer, who takes no thought for the\r\nfuture, has formed a subject for our earliest exercises in repetition.\r\nIn verses that are very easily learnt, she is shown to us, when the\r\nbitter winds begin to blow, quite destitute and hurrying to her\r\nneighbour, the Ant, to announce her hunger. The would-be borrower meets\r\nwith a poor welcome and with a reply which has remained proverbial and\r\nis the chief cause of the little creature’s fame. Those two short\r\nlines,\r\n\r\n\r\n        Vous chantiez! J’en suis bien en aise.\r\n        Eh bien, dansez maintenant, [1]\r\n\r\n\r\nwith their petty malice, have done more for the Cicada’s celebrity than\r\nall her talent as a musician. They enter the child’s mind like a wedge\r\nand never leave it.\r\n\r\nTo most of us, the Cicada’s song is unknown, for she dwells in the land\r\nof the olive-trees; but we all, big and little, have heard of the snub\r\nwhich she received from the Ant. See how reputations are made! A story\r\nof very doubtful value, offending as much against morality as against\r\nnatural history; a nursery-tale whose only merit lies in its brevity:\r\nthere we have the origin of a renown which will tower over the ruins of\r\nthe centuries like Hop-o’-my-Thumb’s boots and Little Red-Riding-Hood’s\r\nbasket.\r\n\r\nThe child is essentially conservative. Custom and traditions become\r\nindestructible once they are confided to the archives of his memory. We\r\nowe to him the celebrity of the Cicada, whose woes he stammered in his\r\nfirst attempts at recitation. He preserves for us the glaring\r\nabsurdities that are part and parcel of the fable: the Cicada will\r\nalways be hungry when the cold comes, though there are no Cicadæ left\r\nin the winter; she will always beg for the alms of a few grains of\r\nwheat, a food quite out of keeping with her delicate sucker; the\r\nsupplicant is supposed to hunt for Flies and grubs, she who never eats!\r\n\r\nWhom are we to hold responsible for these curious blunders? La\r\nFontaine, [2] who charms us in most of his fables with his exquisite\r\ndelicacy of observation, is very ill-inspired in this case. He knows\r\nthoroughly his common subjects, the Fox, the Wolf, the Cat, the Goat,\r\nthe Crow, the Rat, the Weasel and many others, whose sayings and doings\r\nhe describes to us with delightful precision of detail. They are local\r\ncharacters, neighbours, housemates of his. Their public and private\r\nlife is spent under his eyes; but, where Jack Rabbit gambols, the\r\nCicada is an entire stranger: La Fontaine never heard of her, never saw\r\nher. To him the famous singer is undoubtedly a Grasshopper.\r\n\r\nGrandville, [3] whose drawings have the same delicious spice of malice\r\nas the text itself, falls into the same error. In his illustration, we\r\nsee the Ant arrayed like an industrious housewife. Standing on her\r\nthreshold, beside great sacks of wheat, she turns a contemptuous back\r\non the borrower, who is holding out her foot, I beg pardon, her hand.\r\nThe second figure wears a great cartwheel hat, with a guitar under her\r\narm and her skirt plastered to her legs by the wind, and is the perfect\r\npicture of a Grasshopper. Grandville no more than La Fontaine suspected\r\nthe real appearance of the Cicada; he reproduced magnificently the\r\ngeneral mistake.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, La Fontaine, in his poor little story, only echoes\r\nanother fabulist. The legend of the Cicada’s sorry welcome by the Ant\r\nis as old as selfishness, that is to say, as old as the world. The\r\nchildren of Athens, going to school with their esparto-grass baskets\r\ncrammed with figs and olives, were already mumbling it as a piece for\r\nrecitation:\r\n\r\n“In winter,” said they, “the Ants dry their wet provisions in the sun.\r\nUp comes a hungry Cicada begging. She asks for a few grains. The greedy\r\nhoarders reply, ‘You used to sing in summer; now dance in winter.’” [4]\r\n\r\nThis, although a little more baldly put, is precisely La Fontaine’s\r\ntheme and is contrary to all sound knowledge.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the fable comes to us from Greece, which is preeminently\r\nthe land of olive-trees and Cicadæ. Was Æsop really the author, as\r\ntradition pretends? It is doubtful. Nor does it matter, after all: the\r\nnarrator is a Greek and a fellow-countryman of the Cicada, whom he must\r\nknow well enough. My village does not contain a peasant so ignorant as\r\nto be unaware of the absolute lack of Cicadæ in winter; every tiller of\r\nthe soil is familiar with the insect’s primary state, the larva, which\r\nhe turns over with his spade as often as he has occasion to bank up the\r\nolive-trees at the approach of the cold weather; he knows, from seeing\r\nit a thousand times along the paths, how this grub leaves the ground\r\nthrough a round pit of its own making, how it fastens on to some twig,\r\nsplits its back, divests itself of its skin, now drier than shrivelled\r\nparchment, and turns into the Cicada, pale grass-green at first, soon\r\nto be succeeded by brown.\r\n\r\nThe Attic peasant was no fool either: he had remarked that which cannot\r\nescape the least observant eye; he also knew what my rustic neighbours\r\nknow so well. The poet, whoever he may have been, who invented the\r\nfable was writing under the best conditions for knowing all about these\r\nthings. Then whence did the blunders in his story arise?\r\n\r\nThe Greek fabulist had less excuse than La Fontaine for portraying the\r\nCicada of the books instead of going to the actual Cicada, whose\r\ncymbals were echoing at his side; heedless of the real, he followed\r\ntradition. He himself was but echoing a more ancient scribe; he was\r\nrepeating some legend handed down from India, the venerable mother of\r\ncivilizations. Without knowing exactly the story which the Hindu’s reed\r\nhad put in writing to show the danger of a life led without foresight,\r\nwe are entitled to believe that the little dialogue set down was nearer\r\nto the truth than the conversation between the Cicada and the Ant.\r\nIndia, the great lover of animals, was incapable of committing such a\r\nmistake. Everything seems to tell us that the leading figure in the\r\noriginal fable was not our Cicada but rather some other creature, an\r\ninsect if you will, whose habits corresponded fittingly with the text\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nImported into Greece, after serving for centuries to make the wise\r\nreflect and to amuse the children on the banks of the Indus, the\r\nancient story, perhaps as old as the first piece of economical advice\r\nvouchsafed by Paterfamilias and handed down more or less faithfully\r\nfrom memory to memory, must have undergone an alteration in its\r\ndetails, as do all legends which the course of the ages adapts to\r\ncircumstances of time and place.\r\n\r\nThe Greek, not possessing in his fields the insect of which the Hindu\r\nspoke, dragged in, as the nearest thing to it, the Cicada, even as in\r\nParis, the modern Athens, the Cicada is replaced by the Grasshopper.\r\nThe mischief was done. Henceforth ineradicable, since it has been\r\nconfided to the memory of childhood, the mistake will prevail against\r\nan obvious truth.\r\n\r\nLet us try to rehabilitate the singer slandered by the fable. He is, I\r\nhasten to admit, an importunate neighbour. Every summer he comes and\r\nsettles in his hundreds outside my door, attracted by the greenery of\r\ntwo tall plane-trees; and here, from sunrise to sunset, the rasping of\r\nhis harsh symphony goes through my head. Amid this deafening concert,\r\nthought is impossible; one’s ideas reel and whirl, are incapable of\r\nconcentrating. When I have not profited by the early hours of the\r\nmorning, my day is lost.\r\n\r\nOh, little demon, plague of my dwelling which I should like to have so\r\npeaceful, they say that the Athenians used to rear you in a cage to\r\nenjoy your singing at their ease! One we could do with, perhaps, during\r\nthe drowsy hour of digestion; but hundreds at a time, all rattling and\r\ndrumming in our ears when we are trying to collect our thoughts, that\r\nis sheer torture! You say that you were here first, do you? Before I\r\ncame, you were in undisputed possession of the two plane-trees; and it\r\nis I who am the intruder there. I agree. Nevertheless, muffle your\r\ndrums, moderate your arpeggios, for the sake of your biographer!\r\n\r\nTruth will have none of the absurd rigmarole which we find in the\r\nfable. That there are sometimes relations between the Cicada and the\r\nAnt is most certain; only, these relations are the converse of what we\r\nare told. They are not made on the initiative of the Cicada, who is\r\nnever dependent on the aid of others for his living; they come from the\r\nAnt, a greedy spoiler, who monopolizes every edible thing for her\r\ngranaries. At no time does the Cicada go crying famine at the doors of\r\nthe Ant-hills, promising honestly to repay principal and interest; on\r\nthe contrary, it is the Ant who, driven by hunger, begs and entreats\r\nthe singer. Entreats, do I say? Borrowing and repaying form no part of\r\nthe pillager’s habits. She despoils the Cicada, brazenly robs him of\r\nhis possessions. Let us describe this theft, a curious point in natural\r\nhistory and, as yet, unknown.\r\n\r\nIn July, during the stifling heat of the afternoon, when the insect\r\npopulace, parched with thirst, vainly wanders around the limp and\r\nwithered flowers in search of refreshment, the Cicada laughs at the\r\ngeneral need. With that delicate gimlet, his rostrum, he broaches a\r\ncask in his inexhaustible cellar. Sitting, always singing, on the\r\nbranch of a shrub, he bores through the firm, smooth bark swollen with\r\nsap ripened by the sun. Driving his sucker through the bung-hole, he\r\ndrinks luxuriously, motionless and rapt in contemplation, absorbed in\r\nthe charms of syrup and song.\r\n\r\nWatch him for a little while. We shall perhaps witness unexpected\r\ntribulation. There are many thirsty ones prowling around, in fact; they\r\ndiscover the well betrayed by the sap that oozes from the margin. They\r\nhasten up, at first with some discretion, confining themselves to\r\nlicking the fluid as it exudes. I see gathering around the mellifluous\r\npuncture Wasps, Flies, Earwigs, Sphex-wasps, [5] Pompili, [6]\r\nRose-chafers [7] and, above all, Ants.\r\n\r\nThe smallest, in order to reach the well, slip under the abdomen of the\r\nCicada, who good-naturedly raises himself on his legs and leaves a free\r\npassage for the intruders; the larger ones, unable to stand still for\r\nimpatience, quickly snatch a sip, retreat, take a walk on the\r\nneighbouring branches and then return and show greater enterprise. The\r\ncoveting becomes more eager; the discreet ones of a moment ago develop\r\ninto turbulent aggressors, ready to chase away from the spring the\r\nwell-sinker who caused it to gush forth.\r\n\r\nIn this brigandage, the worst offenders are the Ants. I have seen them\r\nnibbling at the ends of the Cicada’s legs; I have caught them tugging\r\nat the tips of his wings, climbing on his back, tickling his antennæ.\r\nOne, greatly daring, went to the length, before my eyes, of catching\r\nhold of his sucker and trying to pull it out.\r\n\r\nThus worried by these pigmies and losing all patience, the giant ends\r\nby abandoning the well. He flees, spraying the robbers with his urine\r\nas he goes. What cares the Ant for this expression of supreme contempt!\r\nHer object is attained. She is now the mistress of the spring, which\r\ndries up only too soon when the pump that made it flow ceases to work.\r\nThere is little of it, but that little is exquisite. It is so much to\r\nthe good, enabling her to wait for another draught, acquired in the\r\nsame fashion, as soon as the occasion presents itself.\r\n\r\nYou see, the actual facts entirely reverse the parts assigned in the\r\nfable. The hardened beggar, who does not shrink from theft, is the Ant;\r\nthe industrious artisan, gladly sharing his possessions with the\r\nsufferer, is the Cicada. I will mention one more detail; and the\r\nreversal of characters will stand out even more clearly. After five or\r\nsix weeks of wassail, which is a long space of time, the singer,\r\nexhausted by the strain of life, drops from the tree. The sun dries up\r\nthe body; the feet of the passers-by crush it. The Ant, always a\r\nhighway-robber in search of spoil, comes upon it. She cuts up the rich\r\ndish, dissects it, carves it and reduces it to morsels which go to\r\nswell her hoard of provisions. It is not unusual to see a dying Cicada,\r\nwith his wing still quivering in the dust, drawn and quartered by a\r\ngang of knackers. He is quite black with them. After this cannibalistic\r\nproceeding, there is no question as to the true relations between the\r\ntwo insects.\r\n\r\nThe ancients held the Cicada in high favour. Anacreon, the Greek\r\nBéranger, [8] devoted an ode to singing his praises in curiously\r\nexaggerated language:\r\n\r\n“Thou art almost like unto the gods,” says he.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which he gives for this apotheosis are none of the best.\r\nThey consist of these three privileges: γηγενής, απαθής,  ὰναιμόσαρκε;\r\nearthborn, insensible to pain, bloodless. Let us not start reproaching\r\nthe poet for these blunders, which were generally believed at the time\r\nand perpetuated for very long after, until the observer’s searching\r\neyes were opened. Besides, it does not do to look so closely at verses\r\nwhose chief merit lies in harmony and rhythm.\r\n\r\nEven in our own days, the Provençal poets, who are at least as familiar\r\nwith the Cicada as Anacreon was, are not so very careful of the truth\r\nin celebrating the insect which they take as an emblem. One of my\r\nfriends, a fervent observer and a scrupulous realist, escapes this\r\nreproach. He has authorized me to take from his unpublished verse the\r\nfollowing Provençal ballad, which depicts the relations between the\r\nCicada and the Ant with strictly scientific accuracy. I leave to him\r\nthe responsibility for his poetic images and his moral views, delicate\r\nflowers outside my province as a naturalist; but I can vouch for the\r\ntruth of his story, which tallies with what I see every summer on the\r\nlilac-trees in my garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n        LA CIGALO E LA FOURNIGO\r\n\r\n        I\r\n\r\n        Jour de Dièu, queto caud!

Cicada thrills\r\n        With mad delight when fairy rills\r\n        Submerge the corn in waves of gold,\r\n        When, with bowed back and toil untold,\r\n        His blade the songless reaper plies,\r\n        For in dry throats song gasps and dies.\r\n\r\n        This hour is thine: then, loud and clear,\r\n        Thy cymbals clash, Cicada dear,\r\n        Let mirrors crack, let belly writhe!\r\n        Behold! The man yet darts his scythe,\r\n        Whose glitter lifts and drops again\r\n        A lightning-flash on ruddy grain.\r\n\r\n        With grass and water well supplied,\r\n        His whetstone dangles at his side;\r\n        The whetstone in its case of wood\r\n        Has moisture for each thirsty mood;\r\n        But he, poor fellow, pants and moans,\r\n        The marrow boiling in his bones.\r\n\r\n        Dost thirst, Cicada? Never mind!\r\n        Deep in a young bough’s tender rind\r\n        Thy sharp proboscis bores a well,\r\n        Whence, narrowly, sweet juices swell.\r\n        Ah, soon what honied joys are thine\r\n        To quaff a vintage so divine!\r\n\r\n        In peace? Not always.... There’s a band\r\n        Of roving thieves (or close at hand)\r\n        Who watched thee draw the nectar up\r\n        And beg one drop with doleful cup.\r\n        Beware, my love! They humbly crave;\r\n        Soon each will prove a saucy knave.\r\n\r\n        The merest sip?—’Tis set aside.\r\n        What’s left?—They are not satisfied.\r\n        All must be theirs, who rudely fling\r\n        A rakish claw athwart thy wing;\r\n        Next on thy back swarm up and down,\r\n        From tip to toe, from tail to crown.\r\n\r\n        On every side they fuss and fret,\r\n        Provoking an impatient jet;\r\n        Thou leavest soon the sprinkled rind,\r\n        Its robber-rascals, far behind;\r\n        Thy well purloined, each grins and skips\r\n        And licks the honey from her lips.\r\n\r\n        No tireless, quenchless mendicant\r\n        Is so persistent as the Ant;\r\n        Wasps, Beetles, Hornets, Drones and Flies,\r\n        Sharpers of every sort and size,\r\n        Loafers, intent on ousting thee,\r\n        All are less obstinate than she.\r\n\r\n        To pinch thy toe, thy nose to tweak,\r\n        To tickle face and loins, to sneak\r\n        Beneath thy belly, who so bold?\r\n        Give her the tiniest foothold,\r\n        The slut will march from side to side\r\n        Across thy wings in shameless pride.\r\n\r\n        II\r\n\r\n        Now here’s a story that is told,\r\n        Incredible, by men of old:\r\n        Once starving on a winter’s day\r\n        By secret, miserable way\r\n        Thou soughtest out the Ant and found\r\n        Her spacious warehouse underground.\r\n\r\n        That rich possessor in the sun\r\n        Was busy drying, one by one,\r\n        Her treasures, moist with the night’s dew,\r\n        Before she buried them from view\r\n        In corn-sacks of sufficient size;\r\n        Then didst thou sue with tearful eyes,\r\n\r\n        Saying, “Alas! This deadly breeze\r\n        Pursues me everywhere; I freeze\r\n        With hunger; let me fill (no more!)\r\n        My wallet from that copious store;\r\n        Next year, when melons are full-blown,\r\n        Be sure I shall repay the loan!\r\n\r\n        “Lend me a little corn!”—Absurd!\r\n        Of course she will not hear a word;\r\n        Thou wilt not win, for all thy pain,\r\n        From bulging sacks a single grain.\r\n        “Be off and scrape the binns!” she cries:\r\n        “Who sang in June, in winter dies.”\r\n\r\n        Thus doth the ancient tail impart\r\n        Fit moral for a miser’s heart;\r\n        Bids him all charity forget\r\n        And draw his purse-strings tighter yet.\r\n        May colic chase such scurvy knaves\r\n        With pangs internal to their graves!\r\n\r\n        A sorry fabulist, indeed,\r\n        Who fancied that the winter’s need\r\n        Would drive thee to subsist, forlorn,\r\n        On Flies, on grubs, on grains of corn;\r\n        No need was ever thine of those,\r\n        For whom the honied fountain flows.\r\n\r\n        What matters winter? All thy kin\r\n        Beneath the earth are gathered in;\r\n        Thou sleepest with unwaking heart,\r\n        While the frail body falls apart\r\n        In rags that unregarded lie,\r\n        Save by the Ant’s rapacious eye.\r\n\r\n        She, groping greedily, one day\r\n        Makes of thy shrivelled corpse her prey;\r\n        Dissects the trunk, gnaws limb from limb,\r\n        Concocts, according to her whim,\r\n        A salad such grim housewives know,\r\n        A tit-bit saved for hours of snow.\r\n\r\n        III\r\n\r\n        That, gentlemen, is truly told,\r\n        Unlike the fairy-tale of old;\r\n        But finds it favour in his sight,\r\n        Who grabs at farthings, day and night?\r\n        Pot-bellied, crooked-fingered, he\r\n        Would rule the world with L.S.D.\r\n\r\n        Such riff-raff spread the vulgar view\r\n        That “artists are a lazy crew,”\r\n        That “fools must suffer.” Silent be!\r\n        When the Cicada taps the tree,\r\n        You steal his drink; when life has fled,\r\n        You basely batten on the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE CICADA: LEAVING THE BURROW\r\n\r\n\r\nTo come back to the Cicada after Réaumur [9] has told the insect’s\r\nstory would be waste of time, save that the disciple enjoys an\r\nadvantage unknown to the master. The great naturalist received the\r\nmaterials for his work from my part of the world; his subjects came by\r\nbarge after being carefully preserved in spirits. I, on the other hand,\r\nlive in the Cicada’s company. When July comes, he takes possession of\r\nthe enclosure right up to the threshold of the house. The hermitage is\r\nour joint property. I remain master indoors; but out of doors he is the\r\nsovereign lord and an extremely noisy and abusive one. Our near\r\nneighbourhood and constant association have enabled me to enter into\r\ncertain details of which Réaumur could not dream.\r\n\r\nThe first Cicadæ appear at the time of the summer solstice. Along the\r\nmuch-trodden paths baked by the sun and hardened by the frequent\r\npassage of feet there open, level with the ground, round orifices about\r\nthe size of a man’s thumb. These are the exit-holes of the\r\nCicada-larvæ, who come up from the depths to undergo their\r\ntransformation on the surface. They are more or less everywhere, except\r\nin soil turned over by the plough. Their usual position is in the\r\ndriest spots, those most exposed to the sun, especially by the side of\r\nthe roads. Equipped with powerful tools to pass, if necessary, through\r\nsandstone and dried clay, the larva, on leaving the earth, has a fancy\r\nfor the hardest places.\r\n\r\nOne of the garden-paths, converted into a little inferno by the glare\r\nfrom a wall facing south, abounds in such exit-holes. I proceed, in the\r\nlast days of June, to examine these recently abandoned pits. The soil\r\nis so hard that I have to take my pickaxe to tackle it.\r\n\r\nThe orifices are round and nearly an inch in diameter. There is\r\nabsolutely no rubbish around them, no mound of earth thrown up outside.\r\nThis is invariably the case: the Cicada’s hole is never surmounted with\r\na mole-hill, as are the burrows of the Geotrupes, [10] or Dorbeetles,\r\nthose other sturdy excavators. The manner of working accounts for this\r\ndifference. The Dung-beetle progresses from the outside inwards; he\r\ncommences his digging at the mouth of the well, which allows him to\r\nascend and heap up on the surface the material which he has extracted.\r\nThe larva of the Cicada, on the other hand, goes from the inside\r\noutwards; the last thing that it does is to open the exit-door, which,\r\nremaining closed until the very end of the work, cannot be used for\r\ngetting rid of the rubbish. The former goes in and makes a mound on the\r\nthreshold of the home; the latter comes out and cannot heap up anything\r\non a threshold that does not yet exist.\r\n\r\nThe Cicada’s tunnel runs to a depth of between fifteen and sixteen\r\ninches. It is cylindrical, winds slightly, according to the exigencies\r\nof the soil, and is always nearly perpendicular, for it is shorter to\r\ngo that way. The passage is quite open throughout its length. It is\r\nuseless to search for the rubbish which this excavation ought, one\r\nwould think, to produce; we see none anywhere. The tunnel ends in a\r\nblind alley, in a rather wider chamber, with level walls and not the\r\nleast vestige of communication with any gallery prolonging the well.\r\n\r\nReckoned by its length and its diameter, the excavation represents a\r\nvolume of about twelve cubic inches. What has become of the earth\r\nremoved? Sunk in very dry and very loose soil, the well and the chamber\r\nat the bottom ought to have crumbly walls, which would easily fall in,\r\nif nothing else had taken place but the work of boring. My surprise was\r\ngreat to find, on the contrary, coated surfaces, washed with a paste of\r\nclayey earth. They are not by a long way what one could call smooth,\r\nbut at any rate their irregularities are covered with a layer of\r\nplaster; and their slippery materials, soaked with some agglutinant,\r\nare kept in position.\r\n\r\nThe larva can move about and climb nearly up to the surface and down\r\nagain to its refuge at the bottom without producing, with its clawed\r\nlegs, landslips which would block the tube, making ascent difficult and\r\nretreat impossible. The miner shores up his galleries with pit-props\r\nand cross-beams; the builder of underground railways strengthens his\r\ntunnels with a casing of brickwork; the Cicada’s larva, which is quite\r\nas clever an engineer, cements its shaft so as to keep it open however\r\nlong it may have to serve.\r\n\r\nIf I surprise the creature at the moment when it emerges from the soil\r\nto make for a neighbouring branch and there undergo its transformation,\r\nI see it at once beat a prudent retreat and, without the slightest\r\ndifficulty, run down again to the bottom of its gallery, proving that,\r\neven when the dwelling is on the point of being abandoned for good, it\r\ndoes not become blocked with earth.\r\n\r\nThe ascending-shaft is not a piece of work improvised in a hurry, in\r\nthe insect’s impatience to reach the sunlight; it is a regular\r\nmanor-house, an abode in which the grub is meant to make a long stay.\r\nSo the plastered walls tell us. Any such precaution would be\r\nsuperfluous in the case of a mere exit abandoned as soon as bored.\r\nThere is not a doubt but that we have here a sort of meteorological\r\nstation in which observations are taken of the weather outside.\r\nUnderground, fifteen inches down, or more, the larva ripe for its\r\nemergence is hardly able to judge whether the climatic conditions be\r\nfavourable. Its subterranean weather is too gradual in its changes to\r\nbe able to supply it with the precise indications necessary for the\r\nmost important action of its life, its escape into the sunlight for the\r\nmetamorphosis.\r\n\r\nPatiently, for weeks, perhaps for months, it digs, clears and\r\nstrengthens a perpendicular chimney, leaving at the surface, to keep it\r\nsequestered from the world without, a layer as thick as one’s finger.\r\nAt the bottom it makes itself a recess more carefully built than the\r\nremainder. This is its refuge, its waiting-room, where it rests if its\r\nreconnoitring lead it to defer its emigration. At the least suspicion\r\nof fine weather, it scrambles up, tests the exterior through the thin\r\nlayer of earth forming a lid and enquires into the temperature and the\r\ndegree of humidity of the air.\r\n\r\nIf things do not bode well, if a heavy shower threaten or a blustering\r\nstorm—events of supreme importance when the delicate Cicada throws off\r\nher skin—the prudent insect slips back to the bottom of the tube and\r\ngoes on waiting. If, on the other hand, the atmospheric conditions be\r\nfavourable, then the ceiling is smashed with a few strokes of the claws\r\nand the larva emerges from the well.\r\n\r\nEverything seems to confirm that the Cicada’s gallery is a\r\nwaiting-room, a meteorological station where the larva stays for a long\r\ntime, now hoisting itself near the surface to discover the state of the\r\nweather, now retreating to the depths for better shelter. This explains\r\nthe convenience of a resting-place at the base and the need for a\r\nstrong cement on walls which, without it, would certainly give way\r\nunder continual comings and goings.\r\n\r\nWhat is not so easily explained is the complete disappearance of the\r\nrubbish corresponding with the space excavated. What has become of the\r\ntwelve cubic inches of earth yielded by an average well? There is\r\nnothing outside to represent them, nor anything inside either. And then\r\nhow, in a soil dry as cinders, is the plaster obtained with which the\r\nwalls are glazed?\r\n\r\nLarvæ that gnaw into wood, such as those of the Capricorn and the\r\nBuprestes, [11] for instance, ought to be able to answer the first\r\nquestion. They make their way inside a tree-trunk, boring galleries by\r\neating the materials of the road which they open. Detached in tiny\r\nfragments by the mandibles, these materials are digested. They pass\r\nthrough the pioneer’s body from end to end, yielding up their meagre\r\nnutritive elements on the way, and accumulate behind, completely\r\nblocking the road which the grub will never take again. The work of\r\nexcessive division and subdivision, done either by the mandibles or the\r\nstomach, causes the digested materials to take up less room than the\r\nuntouched wood; and the result is a space in front of the gallery, a\r\nchamber in which the grub works, a chamber which is greatly restricted\r\nin length, giving the prisoner just enough room to move about.\r\n\r\nCan it not be in a similar fashion that the Cicada-grub bores its\r\ntunnel? Certainly the waste material flung up as it digs its way does\r\nnot pass through its body; even if the soil were of the softest and\r\nmost yielding character, earth plays no part whatever in the larva’s\r\nfood. But, after all, cannot the materials removed be simply shot back\r\nas the work proceeds? The Cicada remains four years in the ground. This\r\nlong life is not, of course, spent at the bottom of the well which we\r\nhave described: this is just a place where the larva prepares for its\r\nemergence. It comes from elsewhere, doubtless from some distance. It is\r\na vagabond, going from one root to another and driving its sucker into\r\neach. When it moves, either to escape from the upper layers, which are\r\ntoo cold in winter, or to settle down at a better drinking-bar, it\r\nclears a road by flinging behind it the materials broken up by its\r\npickaxes. This is undoubtedly the method.\r\n\r\nAs with the larvæ of the Capricorn and the Buprestes, the traveller\r\nneeds around him only the small amount of free room which his movements\r\nrequire. Damp, soft, easily compressed earth is to this larva what the\r\ndigested pap is to the others. Such earth is heaped up without\r\ndifficulty; it condenses and leaves a vacant space.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is one of a different kind with the exit-well bored in a\r\nvery dry soil, which offers a marked resistance to compression so long\r\nas it retains its aridity. That the larva, when beginning to dig its\r\npassage, flung back part of the excavated materials into an earlier\r\ngallery which has now disappeared is fairly probable, though there is\r\nnothing in the condition of things to tell us so; but, if we consider\r\nthe capacity of the well and the extreme difficulty of finding room for\r\nso great a volume of rubbish, our doubts return and we say to\r\nourselves:\r\n\r\n“This rubbish demanded a large empty space, which itself was obtained\r\nby shifting other refuse no less difficult to house. The room required\r\npresupposes the existence of another space into which the earth\r\nextracted was shot.”\r\n\r\nAnd so we find ourselves in a vicious circle, for the mere subsidence\r\nof materials flung behind would not be enough to explain so great a\r\nvoid. The Cicada must have a special method of disposing of the\r\nsuperfluous earth. Let us try and surprise his secret.\r\n\r\nExamine a larva at the moment when it emerges from the ground. It is\r\nnearly always more or less soiled with mud, sometimes wet, sometimes\r\ndry. The digging-implements, the fore-feet, have the points of their\r\npickaxes stuck in a globule of slime; its other legs are cased in mud;\r\nits back is spotted with clay. We are reminded of a scavenger who has\r\nbeen stirring up sewage. These stains are the more striking inasmuch as\r\nthe creature comes out of exceedingly dry ground. We expected to see it\r\ncovered with dust and we find it covered with mud.\r\n\r\nOne more step in this direction and the problem of the well is solved.\r\nI exhume a larva which happens to be working at its exit-gallery. Very\r\noccasionally, I get a piece of luck like this, in the course of my\r\ndigging; it would be useless for me to try for it, as there is nothing\r\noutside to guide my search. My welcome prize is just beginning its\r\nexcavations. An inch of tunnel, free from any rubbish, and the\r\nwaiting-room at the bottom represent all the work for the moment. In\r\nwhat condition is the worker? We shall see.\r\n\r\nThe grub is much paler in colour than those which I catch as they\r\nemerge. Its big eyes in particular are whitish, cloudy, squinting and\r\napparently of little use for seeing. What good is sight underground?\r\nThe eyes of the larvæ issuing from the earth are, on the contrary,\r\nblack and shining and indicate ability to see. When it makes its\r\nappearance in the sunshine, the future Cicada has to seek, occasionally\r\nat some distance from the exit-hole, the hanging branch on which the\r\nmetamorphosis will be performed; and here sight will manifestly be\r\nuseful. This maturity of vision attained during the preparation for the\r\nrelease is enough to show us that the larva, far from hastily\r\nimprovising its ascending-shaft, works at it for a long time.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the pale and blind larva is bulkier than it is in the state\r\nof maturity. It is swollen with liquid and looks dropsical. If you take\r\nit in your fingers, a limpid humour oozes from the hinder part and\r\nmoistens the whole body. Is this fluid, expelled from the intestines, a\r\nurinary product? Is it just the residue of a stomach fed solely on sap?\r\nI will not decide the question and will content myself with calling it\r\nurine, merely for convenience.\r\n\r\nWell, this fountain of urine is the key to the mystery. The larva, as\r\nit goes on and digs, sprinkles the dusty materials and makes them into\r\npaste, which is forthwith applied to the walls by abdominal pressure.\r\nThe original dryness is succeeded by plasticity. The mud obtained\r\npenetrates the interstices of a rough soil; the more liquid part of it\r\ntrickles in front; the remainder is compressed and packed and occupies\r\nthe empty spaces in between. Thus is an unblocked tunnel obtained,\r\nwithout any refuse, because the dust and rubbish are used on the spot\r\nin the form of a mortar which is more compact and more homogeneous than\r\nthe soil traversed.\r\n\r\nThe larva therefore works in the midst of clayey mire; and this is the\r\ncause of the stains that astonish us so much when we see it issuing\r\nfrom excessively dry soil. The perfect insect, though relieved\r\nhenceforth from all mining labour, does not utterly abandon the use of\r\nits bladder; a few drains of urine are preserved as a weapon of\r\ndefence. When too closely observed, it discharges a spray at the\r\nintruder and quickly flies away. In either form, the Cicada, his dry\r\nconstitution notwithstanding, proves himself a skilled irrigator.\r\n\r\nDropsical though it be, the larva cannot carry sufficient liquid to\r\nmoisten and turn into compressible mud the long column of earth which\r\nhas to be tunnelled. The reservoir becomes exhausted and the supply has\r\nto be renewed. How is this done and when? I think I see.\r\n\r\nThe few wells which I have laid bare throughout their length, with the\r\npainstaking care which this sort of digging demands, show me at the\r\nbottom, encrusted in the wall of the terminal chamber, a live root,\r\nsometimes as big as a lead-pencil, sometimes no thicker than a straw.\r\nThe visible part of this root is quite small, barely a fraction of an\r\ninch. The rest is contained in the surrounding earth. Is the discovery\r\nof this sort of sap fortuitous? Or is it the result of a special search\r\non the larva’s part? The presence of a rootlet is so frequent, at least\r\nwhen my digging is skilfully conducted, that I rather favour the latter\r\nalternative.\r\n\r\nYes, the Cicada-grub, when hollowing out its cell, the starting-point\r\nof the future chimney, seeks the immediate neighbourhood of a small\r\nlive root; it lays bare a certain portion, which continues the side\r\nwall without projecting. This live spot in the wall is, I think, the\r\nfount from which the contents of the urinary bladder are renewed as the\r\nneed arises. When its reserves are exhausted by the conversion of dry\r\ndust into mud, the miner goes down to his chamber, drives in his sucker\r\nand takes a deep draught from the cask built into the wall. With his\r\njug well filled, he goes up again. He resumes his work, wetting the\r\nhard earth the better to flatten it with his claws and reducing the\r\ndusty rubbish to mud which can be heaped up around him and leave a\r\nclear thoroughfare. That is how things must happen. So logic and the\r\ncircumstances of the case tell us, in the absence of direct\r\nobservation, which is not feasible here.\r\n\r\nIf this root-cask fail, if moreover the reservoir of the intestine be\r\nexhausted, what will happen then? We shall learn from the following\r\nexperiment. I catch a grub as it is leaving the ground. I put it at the\r\nbottom of a test-tube and cover it with a column of dry earth, not too\r\nclosely packed. The column is nearly six inches high. The larva has\r\njust quitted an excavation thrice as deep, in soil of the same nature,\r\nbut offering a much greater resistance. Now that it is buried under my\r\nshort, sandy column, will it be capable of climbing to the surface? If\r\nit were a mere matter of strength, the issue would be certain. What can\r\nan obstacle without cohesion be to one that has just bored a hole\r\nthrough the hard ground?\r\n\r\nAnd yet I am assailed by doubts. To break down the screen that still\r\nseparated it from the outer air, the larva has expended its last\r\nreserves of fluid. The flask is dry; and there is no way of\r\nreplenishing it in the absence of a live root. My suspicion of failure\r\nis well-founded. For three days I see the entombed one wasting itself\r\nin efforts without succeeding in rising an inch higher. The materials\r\nremoved refuse to stay in position for lack of anything to bind them;\r\nthey are no sooner pushed aside than they slip down again under the\r\ninsect’s legs. The labour has no perceptible result and has always to\r\nbe done all over again. On the fourth day, the creature dies.\r\n\r\nWith the water-can full, the result is quite different. I subject to\r\nthe same experiment an insect whose work of self-deliverance is just\r\nbeginning. It is all swollen with urinary humours which ooze out and\r\nmoisten its whole body. This one’s task is easy. The materials offer\r\nhardly any resistance. A little moisture, supplied by the miner’s\r\nflask, converts them into mud, sticks them together and keeps them out\r\nof the way. The passage is opened, very irregular in shape, it is true,\r\nand almost filled up at the back as the ascent proceeds. It is as\r\nthough the larva, recognizing the impossibility of renewing its store\r\nof fluid, were saving up the little which it possesses and spending no\r\nmore than is strictly necessary to enable it to escape as quickly as\r\npossible from its unfamiliar surroundings. This economy is so well\r\narranged that the insect reaches the surface at the end of ten days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CICADA: THE TRANSFORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exit-gate is passed and left wide open, like a hole made with a\r\nlarge gimlet. For some time the larva wanders about the neighbourhood,\r\nlooking for some aerial support, a tiny bush, a tuft of thyme, a blade\r\nof grass or the twig of a shrub. It finds it, climbs up and, head\r\nupwards, clings to it firmly with the claws of the fore-feet, which\r\nclose and do not let go again. The other legs take part in sustaining\r\nit, if the position of the branch make this possible; if not, the two\r\nclaws suffice. There follows a moment of rest to allow the supporting\r\narms to stiffen into an immovable grip.\r\n\r\nFirst, the mesothorax splits along the middle of the back. The edges of\r\nthe slit separate slowly and reveal the pale-green colour of the\r\ninsect. Almost immediately afterwards, the prothorax splits also. The\r\nlongitudinal fissure reaches the back of the head above and the\r\nmetathorax below, without spreading farther. The wrapper of the skull\r\nbreaks crosswise, in front of the eyes; and the red stemmata appear.\r\nThe green portion uncovered by these ruptures swells and protrudes over\r\nthe whole of the mesothorax. We see slow palpitations, alternate\r\ncontractions and distensions due to the ebb and flow of the blood. This\r\nhernia, working at first out of sight, is the wedge that made the\r\ncuirass split along two crossed lines of least resistance.\r\n\r\nThe skinning-operation makes rapid progress. Soon the head is free.\r\nThen the rostrum and the front legs gradually leave their sheaths. The\r\nbody is horizontal, with the ventral surface turned upwards. Under the\r\nwide-open carapace appear the hinder legs, the last to be released. The\r\nwings are distended with moisture. They are still rumpled and look like\r\nstumps bent into a bow. This first phase of the transformation has\r\ntaken but ten minutes.\r\n\r\nThere remains the second, which lasts longer. The whole of the insect\r\nis free, except the tip of the abdomen, which is still contained in its\r\nscabbard. The cast skin continues to grip the twig. Stiffening as the\r\nresult of quick desiccation, it preserves without change the attitude\r\nwhich it had at the start. It forms the pivot for what is about to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nFixed to his slough by the tip of the abdomen, which is not yet\r\nextracted, the Cicada turns over perpendicularly, head downwards. He is\r\npale-green, tinged with yellow. The wings, until now compressed into\r\nthick stumps, straighten out, unfurl, spread under the rush of the\r\nliquid with which they are gorged. When this slow and delicate\r\noperation is ended, the Cicada, with an almost imperceptible movement,\r\ndraws himself up by sheer strength of loin and resumes a normal\r\nposition, head upwards. The fore-legs hook on to the empty skin; and at\r\nlast the tip of the belly is drawn from its sheath. The extraction is\r\nover. The work has required half an hour altogether.\r\n\r\nHere is the whole insect, freed from its mask, but how different from\r\nwhat it will be presently! The wings are heavy, moist, transparent,\r\nwith their veins a light green. The prothorax and mesothorax are barely\r\ntinged with brown. All the rest of the body is pale-green, whitish in\r\nplaces. It must bathe in air and sunshine for a long time before\r\nstrength and colour can come to its frail body. About two hours pass\r\nwithout producing any noticeable change. Hanging to his cast skin by\r\nhis fore-claws only, the Cicada sways at the least breath of air, still\r\nfeeble and still green. At last the brown tinge appears, becomes more\r\nmarked and is soon general. Half an hour has effected the change of\r\ncolour. Slung from the suspension-twig at nine o’clock in the morning,\r\nthe Cicada flies away, before my eyes, at half-past twelve.\r\n\r\nThe cast skin remains, intact, save for its fissure, and so firmly\r\nfastened that the rough weather of autumn does not always succeed in\r\nbringing it to the ground. For some months yet, even during the winter,\r\none often meets old skins hanging in the bushes in the exact position\r\nadopted by the larva at the moment of its transformation. Their horny\r\nnature, something like dry parchment, ensures a long existence for\r\nthese relics.\r\n\r\nLet us hark back for a moment to the gymnastic feat which enables the\r\nCicada to leave his scabbard. At first retained by the tip of the\r\nabdomen, which is the last part to remain in its case, the Cicada turns\r\nover perpendicularly, head downwards. This somersault allows him to\r\nfree his wings and legs, after the head and chest have already made\r\ntheir appearance by cracking the armour under the pressure of a hernia.\r\nNow comes the time to free the end of the abdomen, the pivot of this\r\ninverted attitude. For this purpose, the insect, with a laborious\r\nmovement of its back, draws itself up, brings its head to the top again\r\nand hooks itself with its fore-claws to the cast skin. A fresh support\r\nis thus obtained, enabling it to pull the tip of its abdomen from its\r\nsheath.\r\n\r\nThere are therefore two means of support: first the end of the belly\r\nand then the front claws; and there are two principal movements: in the\r\nfirst place the downward somersault, in the second place the return to\r\nthe normal position. These gymnastics demand that the larva shall fix\r\nitself to a twig, head upwards, and that it shall have a free space\r\nbeneath it. Suppose that these conditions were lacking, thanks to my\r\nwiles: what would happen? That remained to be seen.\r\n\r\nI tie a thread to the end of one of the hind-legs and hang the larva up\r\nin the peaceful atmosphere of a test-tube. My thread is a plumb-line\r\nwhich will remain vertical, for there is nothing to interfere with it.\r\nIn this unwonted posture, which places its head at the bottom at a time\r\nwhen the near approach of the transformation demands that it should be\r\nat the top, the unfortunate creature for a long time kicks about and\r\nstruggles, striving to turn over and to seize with its fore-claws\r\neither the thread by which it hangs or one of its own hind-legs. Some\r\nof them succeed in their efforts, draw themselves up as best they can,\r\nfasten themselves as they wish, despite the difficulty of keeping their\r\nbalance, and effect their metamorphosis without impediment.\r\n\r\nOthers wear themselves out in vain. They do not catch hold of the\r\nthread, they do not bring their heads upwards. Then the transformation\r\nis not accomplished. Sometimes the dorsal rupture takes place, leaving\r\nbare the mesothorax swollen into a hernia, but the shelling proceeds no\r\nfarther and the insect soon dies. More often still the larva perishes\r\nintact, without the least fissure.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment. I place the larva in a glass jar with a thin bed of\r\nsand, which makes progress possible. The animal moves along, but is not\r\nable to hoist itself up anywhere: the slippery sides of the glass\r\nprevent this. Under these conditions, the captive expires without\r\ntrying to transform itself. I have known exceptions to this miserable\r\nending; I have sometimes seen the larva undergo a regular metamorphosis\r\non a layer of sand thanks to peculiarities of equilibrium which were\r\nvery difficult to distinguish. In the main, when the normal attitude or\r\nsomething very near it is impossible, metamorphosis does not take place\r\nand the insect succumbs. That is the general rule.\r\n\r\nThis result seems to tell us that the larva is capable of opposing the\r\nforces which are at work in it when the transformation is at hand. A\r\ncabbage-silique, a pea-pod invariably burst to set free their seeds.\r\nThe Cicada-larva, a sort of pod containing, by way of seed, the perfect\r\ninsect, is able to control its dehiscence, to defer it until a more\r\nopportune moment and even to suppress it altogether in unfavourable\r\ncircumstances. Convulsed by the profound revolution that takes place in\r\nits body on the point of transfiguration, but at the same time warned\r\nby instinct that the conditions are not good, the insect makes a\r\ndesperate resistance and dies rather than consent to open.\r\n\r\nApart from the trials to which my curiosity subjects it, I do not see\r\nthat the Cicada-larva is exposed to any danger of perishing in this\r\nway. There is always a bit of brushwood of some kind near the\r\nexit-hole. The newly-exhumed insect climbs on it; and a few minutes are\r\nenough for the animal pod to split down the back. This swift hatching\r\nhas often been a source of trouble to me in my studies. A larva appears\r\non the hills not far from my house. I catch sight of it just as it is\r\nfastening on the twig. It would form an interesting subject of\r\nobservation indoors. I place it in a paper bag, together with the stick\r\nthat carries it, and hurry home. This takes me a quarter of an hour,\r\nbut it is labour lost: by the time that I arrive, the green Cicada is\r\nalmost free. I shall not see what I was bent on seeing. I had to\r\nabandon this method of obtaining information and be content with an\r\noccasional lucky find within a few yards of my door.\r\n\r\n“Everything is in everything,” as Jacotot the pedagogue [12] used to\r\nsay. In connection with that remarkably quick metamorphosis a culinary\r\nquestion arises. According to Aristotle, Cicadæ were a\r\nhighly-appreciated dish among the Greeks. I am not acquainted with the\r\ngreat naturalist’s text: humble villager that I am, my library\r\npossesses no such treasure. I happen, however, to have before me a\r\nvenerable tome which can tell me just what I want to know. I refer to\r\nMatthiolus’ Commentaries on Dioscorides. [13] As an eminent scholar,\r\nwho must have known his Aristotle very well, Matthiolus inspires me\r\nwith complete confidence. Now he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Mirum non est quod dixerit Aristoteles, cicadas esse gustu\r\n    suavissimas antequam tettigometræ rumpatur cortex.”\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowing that tettigometra, or mother of the Cicada, is the expression\r\nused by the ancients to denote the larva, we see that, according to\r\nAristotle, the Cicadæ possess a flavour most delicious to the taste\r\nbefore the bark or outer covering of the matrix bursts.\r\n\r\nThis detail of the unbroken covering tells us at what season the\r\ntoothsome dainty should be picked. It cannot be in winter, when the\r\nearth is dug deep by the plough, for at that time there is no danger of\r\nthe larva’s hatching. People do not recommend an utterly superfluous\r\nprecaution. It is therefore in summer, at the period of the emergence\r\nfrom underground, when a good search will discover the larvæ, one by\r\none, on the surface of the soil. This is the real moment to take care\r\nthat the wrapper is unbroken. It is the moment also to hasten the\r\ngathering and the preparations for cooking: in a very few minutes the\r\nwrapper will burst.\r\n\r\nAre the ancient culinary reputation and that appetizing epithet,\r\nsuavissimas gustu, well-deserved? We have an excellent opportunity: let\r\nus profit by it and restore to honour, if the occasion warrant it, the\r\ndish extolled by Aristotle. Rondelet, [14] Rabelais’ erudite friend,\r\ngloried in having rediscovered garum, the famous sauce made from the\r\nentrails of rotten fish. Would it not be a meritorious work to give the\r\nepicures their tettigometræ again?\r\n\r\nOn a morning in July, when the sun is up and has invited the Cicadæ to\r\nleave the ground, the whole household, big and little, go out\r\nsearching. There are five of us engaged in exploring the enclosure,\r\nespecially the edges of paths, which yield the best results. To prevent\r\nthe skin from bursting, as each larva is found I dip it into a glass of\r\nwater. Asphyxia will stay the work of metamorphosis. After two hours of\r\ncareful seeking, when every forehead is streaming with perspiration, I\r\nam the owner of four larvæ, no more. They are dead or dying in their\r\npreserving bath; but this does not matter, since they are destined for\r\nthe frying-pan.\r\n\r\nThe method of cooking is of the simplest, so as to alter as little as\r\npossible the flavour reputed to be so exquisite: a few drops of oil, a\r\npinch of salt, a little onion and that is all. There is no conciser\r\nrecipe in the whole of La Cuisinière bourgeoise. At dinner, the fry is\r\ndivided fairly among all of us hunters.\r\n\r\nThe stuff is unanimously admitted to be eatable. True, we are people\r\nblessed with good appetites and wholly unprejudiced stomachs. There is\r\neven a slightly shrimpy flavour which would be found in a still more\r\npronounced form in a brochette of Locusts. It is, however, as tough as\r\nthe devil and anything but succulent; we really feel as if we were\r\nchewing bits of parchment. I will not recommend to anybody the dish\r\nextolled by Aristotle.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the renowned animal-historian was remarkably well-informed\r\nas a rule. His royal pupil sent on his behalf to India, the land at\r\nthat time so full of mystery, for the curiosities most impressive to\r\nMacedonian eyes; he received by caravan the Elephant, the Panther, the\r\nTiger, the Rhinoceros, the Peacock; and he described them faithfully.\r\nBut, in Macedonia itself, he knew the insect only through the peasant,\r\nthat stubborn tiller of the soil, who found the tettigometra under his\r\nspade and was the first to know that a Cicada comes out of it.\r\nAristotle, therefore, in his immense undertaking, was doing more or\r\nless what Pliny was to do later, with a much greater amount of artless\r\ncredulity. He listened to the chit-chat of the country-side and set it\r\ndown as veracious history.\r\n\r\nRustic waggery is world-famous. The countryman is always ready to jeer\r\nat the trifles which we call science; he laughs at whoso stops to\r\nexamine an insignificant insect; he goes into fits of laughter if he\r\nsees us picking up a pebble, looking at it and putting it in our\r\npocket. The Greek peasant excelled in this sort of thing. He told the\r\ntownsman that the tettigometra was a dish fit for the gods, of an\r\nincomparable flavour, suavissima gustu. But, while making his victim’s\r\nmouth water with hyperbolical praises, he put it out of his power to\r\nsatisfy his longings, by laying down the essential condition that he\r\nmust gather the delicious morsel before the shell had burst.\r\n\r\nI should like to see any one try to get together the material for a\r\nsufficiently copious dish by gathering a few handfuls of tettigometræ\r\njust coming out of the earth, when my squad of five took two hours to\r\nfind four larvæ on ground rich in Cicadæ. Above all, mind that the skin\r\ndoes not break during your search, which will last for days and days,\r\nwhereas the bursting takes place in a few minutes. My opinion is that\r\nAristotle never tasted a fry of tettigometræ; and my own culinary\r\nexperience is my witness. He is repeating some rustic jest in all good\r\nfaith. His heavenly dish is too horrible for words.\r\n\r\nOh, what a fine collection of stories I too could make about the\r\nCicada, if I listened to all that my neighbours the peasants tell me! I\r\nwill give one particular of his history and one alone, as related in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nHave you any renal infirmity? Are you dropsical at all? Do you need a\r\npowerful depurative? The village pharmacopœia is unanimous in\r\nsuggesting the Cicada as a sovran remedy. The insects are collected in\r\nsummer, in their adult form. They are strung together and dried in the\r\nsun and are fondly preserved in a corner of the press. A housewife\r\nwould think herself lacking in prudence if she allowed July to pass\r\nwithout threading her store of them.\r\n\r\nDo you suffer from irritation of the kidneys, or perhaps from\r\nstricture? Quick, have some Cicada-tea! Nothing, they tell me, is so\r\nefficacious. I am duly grateful to the good soul who once, as I have\r\nsince heard, made me drink a concoction of the sort, without my knowing\r\nit, for some trouble or other; but I remain profoundly incredulous. I\r\nam struck, however, by the fact that the same specific was recommended\r\nlong ago by Dioscorides. The old Cilician doctor tells us:\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Cicadæ, quæ inassatæ manduntur, vesicæ doloribus prosunt.” [15]\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since the far-off days of this patriarch of materia medica, the\r\nProvençal peasant has retained his faith in the remedy revealed to him\r\nby the Greeks who brought the olive, the fig-tree and the vine from\r\nPhocæa. One thing alone is changed: Dioscorides advises us to eat our\r\nCicadæ roasted; nowadays they are boiled and taken as an infusion.\r\n\r\nThe explanation given of the insect’s diuretic properties is\r\nwonderfully ingenuous. The Cicada, as all of us here know, shoots a\r\nsudden spray of urine, as it flies away, in the face of any one who\r\ntries to take hold of it. He is therefore bound to hand on his powers\r\nof evacuation to us. Thus must Dioscorides and his contemporaries have\r\nargued; and thus does the peasant of Provence argue to this day.\r\n\r\nO my worthy friends, what would you say if you knew the virtues of the\r\ntettigometra, which is capable of mixing mortar with its urine to build\r\na meteorological station withal! You would be driven to borrow the\r\nhyperbole of Rabelais, who shows us Gargantua seated on the towers of\r\nNotre-Dame and drowning with the deluge from his mighty bladder so many\r\nthousand Paris loafers, not to mention the women and children!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE CICADA: HIS MUSIC\r\n\r\n\r\nBy his own confession, Réaumur never heard the Cicada sing; he never\r\nsaw the insect alive. It reached him from the country round Avignon\r\npreserved in spirits and a goodly supply of sugar. These conditions\r\nwere enough to enable the anatomist to give an exact description of the\r\norgan of sound; nor did the master fail to do so: his penetrating eye\r\nclearly discerned the construction of the strange musical-box, so much\r\nso that his treatise upon it has become the fountain-head for any one\r\nwho wants to say a few words about the Cicada’s song.\r\n\r\nWith him the harvest was gathered; it but remains to glean a few ears\r\nwhich the disciple hopes to make into a sheaf. I have more than enough\r\nof what Réaumur lacked: I hear rather more of these deafening\r\nsymphonists than I could wish; and so I shall perhaps obtain a little\r\nfresh light on a subject that seems exhausted. Let us therefore go back\r\nto the question of the Cicada’s song, repeating only so much of the\r\ndata acquired as may be necessary to make my explanation clear.\r\n\r\nIn my neighbourhood I can capture five species of Cicadæ, namely,\r\nCicada plebeia, Lin.; C. orni, Lin.; C. hematodes, Lin.; C. atra,\r\nOliv.; and C. pygmæa, Oliv. The first two are extremely common; the\r\nthree others are rarities, almost unknown to the country-folk.\r\n\r\nThe Common Cicada is the biggest of the five, the most popular and the\r\none whose musical apparatus is usually described. Under the male’s\r\nchest, immediately behind the hind-legs, are two large semicircular\r\nplates, overlapping each other slightly, the right plate being on the\r\ntop of the left. These are the shutters, the lids, the dampers, in\r\nshort the opercula of the organ of sound. Lift them up. You then see\r\nopening, on either side, a roomy cavity, known in Provence by the name\r\nof the chapel (li capello). The two together form the church (la\r\nglèiso). They are bounded in front by a soft, thin, creamy-yellow\r\nmembrane; at the back by a dry pellicle, iridescent as a soap-bubble\r\nand called the mirror (mirau) in the Provençal tongue.\r\n\r\nThe church, the mirrors and the lids are commonly regarded as the\r\nsound-producing organs. Of a singer short of breath it is said that he\r\nhas cracked his mirrors (a li mirau creba). Picturesque language says\r\nthe same thing of an uninspired poet. Acoustics give the lie to the\r\npopular belief. You can break the mirrors, remove the lids with a cut\r\nof the scissors, tear the yellow front membrane and these mutilations\r\nwill not do away with the Cicada’s song: they simply modify it, weaken\r\nit slightly. The chapels are resonators. They do not produce sound,\r\nthey increase it by the vibrations of their front and back membranes;\r\nthey change it as their shutters are opened more or less wide.\r\n\r\nThe real organ of sound is seated elsewhere and is not easy to find,\r\nfor a novice. On the other side of each chapel, at the ridge joining\r\nthe belly to the back, is a slit bounded by horny walls and masked by\r\nthe lowered lid. Let us call it the window. This opening leads to a\r\ncavity or sound-chamber deeper than the adjacent chapel, but much less\r\nwide. Immediately behind the attachment of the rear wings is a slight,\r\nalmost oval protuberance, which is distinguished by its dull-black\r\ncolour from the silvery down of the surrounding skin. This protuberance\r\nis the outer wall of the sound-chamber.\r\n\r\nLet us make a large cut in it. We now lay bare the sound-producing\r\napparatus, the cymbal. This is a little dry, white membrane,\r\noval-shaped, convex on the outside, crossed from end to end of its\r\nlonger diameter by a bundle of three or four brown nervures, which give\r\nit elasticity, and fixed all round in a stiff frame. Imagine this\r\nbulging scale to be pulled out of shape from within, flattening\r\nslightly and then quickly recovering its original convexity owing to\r\nthe spring of its nervures. The drawing in and blowing out will produce\r\na clicking sound.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, all Paris went mad over a silly toy called the\r\nCricket, or Cri-cri, if I remember rightly. It consisted of a short\r\nblade of steel, fastened at one end to a metallic base. Alternately\r\npressed out of shape with the thumb and then released, the said blade,\r\nthough possessing no other merit, gave out a very irritating click; and\r\nnothing more was needed to make it popular. The Cricket’s vogue is\r\nover. Oblivion has done justice to it so drastically that I doubt if I\r\nshall be understood when I recall the once famous apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe membranous cymbal and steel Cricket are similar instruments. Both\r\nare made to rattle by pushing an elastic blade out of shape and\r\nrestoring it to its original condition. The Cricket was bent out of\r\nshape with the thumb. How is the convexity of the cymbals modified? Let\r\nus go back to the church and break the yellow curtain that marks the\r\nboundary of each chapel in front. Two thick muscular columns come in\r\nsight, of a pale orange colour, joined together in the form of a V,\r\nwith its point standing on the insect’s median line, on the lower\r\nsurface. Each of these fleshy columns ends abruptly at the top, as\r\nthough lopped off; and from the truncated stump rises a short, slender\r\ncord which is fastened to the side of the corresponding cymbal.\r\n\r\nThere you have the whole mechanism, which is no less simple than that\r\nof the metal Cricket. The two muscular columns contract and relax,\r\nshorten and lengthen. By means of the terminal thread each tugs at its\r\ncymbal, pulling it down and forthwith letting it spring back of itself.\r\nThus are the two sound-plates made to vibrate.\r\n\r\nWould you convince yourself of the efficacy of this mechanism? Would\r\nyou make a dead but still fresh Cicada sing? Nothing could be simpler.\r\nSeize one of the muscular columns with the pincers and jerk it gently.\r\nThe dead Cri-cri comes to life again; each jerk produces the clash of\r\nthe cymbal. The sound is very feeble, I admit, deprived of the fulness\r\nwhich the living virtuoso obtains with the aid of his sound-chambers;\r\nnevertheless the fundamental element of the song is produced by this\r\nanatomical trick.\r\n\r\nWould you on the other hand silence a live Cicada, that obstinate\r\nmelomaniac who, when you hold him prisoner in your fingers, bewails his\r\nsad lot as garrulously as, just now, he sang his joys in the tree? It\r\nis no use to break open his chapels, to crack his mirrors: the shameful\r\nmutilation would not check him. But insert a pin through the side slit\r\nwhich we have called the window and touch the cymbal at the bottom of\r\nthe sound-chamber. A tiny prick; and the perforated cymbal is silent. A\r\nsimilar operation on the other side renders the insect mute, though it\r\nremains as vigorous as before, showing no perceptible wound. Any one\r\nunacquainted with the method of procedure stands amazed at the result\r\nof my pin-prick, when the utter destruction of the mirrors and the\r\nother accessories of the church does not produce silence. A tiny and in\r\nno way serious stab has an effect which is not caused even by\r\nevisceration.\r\n\r\nThe lids, those firmly fitted plates, are stationary. It is the abdomen\r\nitself which, by rising and falling, causes the church to open and\r\nshut. When the abdomen is lowered, the lids cover the chapels exactly,\r\ntogether with the windows of the sound-chambers. The sound is then\r\nweakened, muffled, stifled. When the abdomen rises, the chapels open,\r\nthe windows are unobstructed and the sound acquires its full strength.\r\nThe rapid oscillations of the belly, therefore, synchronizing with the\r\ncontractions of the motor-muscles of the cymbals, determine the varying\r\nvolume of the sound, which seems to come from hurried strokes of a bow.\r\n\r\nWhen the weather is calm and warm, about the middle of the day, the\r\nCicada’s song is divided into strophes of a few seconds’ duration,\r\nseparated by short pauses. The strophe begins abruptly. In a rapid\r\ncrescendo, the abdomen oscillating faster and faster, it acquires its\r\nmaximum volume; it keeps up the same degree of strength for a few\r\nseconds and then becomes gradually weaker and degenerates into a\r\ntremolo which decreases as the belly relapses into rest. With the last\r\npulsations of the abdomen comes silence, which lasts for a longer or\r\nshorter time according to the condition of the atmosphere. Then\r\nsuddenly we hear a new strophe, a monotonous repetition of the first;\r\nand so on indefinitely.\r\n\r\nIt often happens, especially during the sultry evening hours, that the\r\ninsect, drunk with sunshine, shortens and even entirely suppresses the\r\npauses. The song is then continuous, but always with alternations of\r\ncrescendo and decrescendo. The first strokes of the bow are given at\r\nabout seven or eight o’clock in the morning; and the orchestra ceases\r\nonly with the dying gleams of the twilight, at about eight o’clock in\r\nthe evening. Altogether the concert lasts the whole round of the clock.\r\nBut, if the sky be overcast, if the wind blow cold, the Cicada is dumb.\r\n\r\nThe second species is only half the size of the Common Cicada and is\r\nknown in the district by the name of the Cacan, a fairly accurate\r\nimitation of his peculiar rattle. This is the Ash Cicada of the\r\nnaturalists; and he is far more alert and more suspicious than the\r\nfirst. His harsh loud song consists of a series of Can! Can! Can! Can!\r\nwith not a pause to divide the ode into strophes. Its monotony and its\r\nharsh shrillness make it a most unpleasant ditty, especially when the\r\norchestra is composed of some hundreds of executants, as happens in my\r\ntwo plane-trees during the dog-days. At such times it is as though a\r\nheap of dry walnuts were being shaken in a bag until the shells\r\ncracked. This irritating concert, a veritable torment, has only one\r\nslight advantage about it: the Ash Cicada does not start quite so early\r\nin the morning as the Common Cicada and does not sit up so late at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAlthough constructed on the same fundamental principles, the vocal\r\napparatus displays numerous peculiarities which give the song its\r\nspecial character. The sound-chamber is entirely lacking, which means\r\nthat there is no entrance-window either. The cymbal is uncovered, just\r\nbehind the insertion of the hind-wing. It again is a dry, white scale,\r\nconvex on the outside and crossed by a bundle of five red-brown\r\nnervures.\r\n\r\nThe first segment of the abdomen thrusts forward a short, wide tongue,\r\nwhich is quite rigid and of which the free end rests on the cymbal.\r\nThis tongue may be compared with the blade of a rattle which, instead\r\nof fitting into the teeth of a revolving wheel, touches the nervures of\r\nthe vibrating cymbal more or less closely. The harsh, grating sound\r\nmust, I think, be partly due to this. It is hardly possible to verify\r\nthe fact when holding the creature in our fingers: the startled Cacan\r\ndoes anything at such times rather than emit his normal song.\r\n\r\nThe lids do not overlap; on the contrary, they are separated by a\r\nrather wide interval. With the rigid tongues, those appendages of the\r\nabdomen, they shelter one half of the cymbals, the other half of which\r\nis quite bare. The abdomen, when pressed with the finger, does not open\r\nto any great extent where it joins the thorax. For the rest, the insect\r\nkeeps still when it sings; it knows nothing of the rapid quivering of\r\nthe belly that modulates the song of the Common Cicada. The chapels are\r\nvery small and almost negligible as sounding-boards. There are mirrors,\r\nit is true, but insignificant ones, measuring scarcely a twenty-fifth\r\nof an inch. In short, the mechanism of sound, which is so highly\r\ndeveloped in the Common Cicada, is very rudimentary here. How then does\r\nthe thin clash of the cymbals manage to gain in volume until it becomes\r\nintolerable?\r\n\r\nThe Ash Cicada is a ventriloquist. If we examine the abdomen by holding\r\nit up to the light, we see that the front two thirds are translucent.\r\nLet us snip off the opaque third part that retains, reduced to the\r\nstrictly indispensable, the organs essential to the propagation of the\r\nspecies and the preservation of the individual. The rest of the belly\r\nis wide open and presents a spacious cavity, with nothing but its\r\ntegumentary walls, except in the case of the dorsal surface, which is\r\nlined with a thin layer of muscle and serves as a support to the\r\nslender digestive tube, which is little more than a thread. The large\r\nreceptacle, forming nearly half of the insect’s total bulk, is\r\ntherefore empty, or nearly so. At the back are seen the two motor\r\npillars of the cymbals, the two muscular columns arranged in a V. To\r\nthe right and left of the point of this V gleam the two tiny mirrors;\r\nand the empty space is continued between the two branches into the\r\ndepths of the thorax.\r\n\r\nThis hollow belly and its thoracic complement form an enormous\r\nresonator, unapproached by that of any other performer in our district.\r\nIf I close with my finger the orifice in the abdomen which I have just\r\nclipped, the sound becomes lower, in conformity with the laws affecting\r\norgan-pipes; if I fit a cylinder, a screw of paper, to the mouth of the\r\nopen belly, the sound becomes louder as well as deeper. With a paper\r\nfunnel properly adjusted, its wide end thrust into the mouth of a\r\ntest-tube acting as a sounding-board, we have no longer the shrilling\r\nof the Cicada but something very near the bellowing of a Bull. My small\r\nchildren, happening to be there at the moment when I am making my\r\nacoustic experiments, run away scared. The familiar insect inspires\r\nthem with terror.\r\n\r\nThe harshness of the sound appears to be due to the tongue of the\r\nrattle rasping the nervures of the vibrating cymbals; its intensity may\r\nno doubt be ascribed to the spacious sounding-board of the belly.\r\nAssuredly one must be passionately enamoured of song thus to empty\r\none’s belly and chest in order to make room for a musical-box. The\r\nessential vital organs are reduced to the minimum, are confined to a\r\ntiny corner, so as to leave a greater space for the sounding-cavity.\r\nSong comes first; all the rest takes second place.\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing that the Ash Cicada does not follow the teaching of\r\nthe evolutionists. If, becoming more enthusiastic from generation to\r\ngeneration, he were able by progressive stages to acquire a ventral\r\nsounding-board fit to compare with that which my paper screws give him,\r\nmy Provence, peopled as it is with Cacans, would one day become\r\nuninhabitable.\r\n\r\nAfter the details which I have already given concerning the Common\r\nCicada, it seems hardly necessary to say how the insupportable\r\nchatterbox of the Ash is rendered dumb. The cymbals are clearly visible\r\non the outside. You prick them with the point of a needle. Complete\r\nsilence follows instantly. Why are there not in my plane-trees, among\r\nthe dagger-wearing insects, auxiliaries who, like myself, love quiet\r\nand who would devote themselves to that task! A mad wish! A note would\r\nthen be lacking in the majestic harvest symphony.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cicada (C. hematodes) is a little smaller than the Common\r\nCicada. He owes his name to the blood-red colour that takes the place\r\nof the other’s brown on the veins of the wings and some other\r\nlineaments of the body. He is rare. I come upon him occasionally in the\r\nhawthorn-bushes. As regards his musical apparatus, he stands half-way\r\nbetween the Common Cicada and the Ash Cicada. He has the former’s\r\noscillation of the belly, which increases or reduces the strength of\r\nthe sound by opening or closing the church; he possesses the latter’s\r\nexposed cymbals, unaccompanied by any sound-chamber or window.\r\n\r\nThe cymbals therefore are bare, immediately after the attachment of the\r\nhind-wings. They are white, fairly regular in their convexity and boast\r\neight long, parallel nervures of a ruddy brown and seven others which\r\nare much shorter and which are inserted singly in the intervals between\r\nthe first. The lids are small and scolloped at their inner edge so as\r\nto cover only half of the corresponding chapel. The opening left by the\r\nhollow in the lid has as a shutter a little pallet fixed to the base of\r\nthe hind-leg, which, by folding itself against the body or lifting\r\nslightly, keeps the aperture either shut or open. The other Cicadæ have\r\neach a similar appendage, but in their case it is narrower and more\r\npointed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as with the Common Cicada, the belly moves freely up and\r\ndown. This heaving movement, combined with the play of the femoral\r\npallets, opens and closes the chapels to varying extents.\r\n\r\nThe mirrors, though not so large as the Common Cicada’s, have the same\r\nappearance. The membrane that faces them on the thorax side is white,\r\noval and very delicate and is tight-stretched when the abdomen is\r\nraised and flabby and wrinkled when the abdomen is lowered. In its\r\ntense state it seems capable of vibration and of increasing the sound.\r\n\r\nThe song, modulated and subdivided into strophes, suggests that of the\r\nCommon Cicada, but is much less objectionable. Its lack of shrillness\r\nmay well be due to the absence of any sound-chambers. Other things\r\nbeing equal, cymbals vibrating uncovered cannot possess the same\r\nintensity of sound as those vibrating at the far end of an echoing\r\nvestibule. The noisy Ash Cicada also, it is true, lacks that vestibule;\r\nbut he amply makes up for its absence by the enormous resonator of his\r\nbelly.\r\n\r\nI have never seen the third Cicada, sketched by Réaumur and described\r\nby Olivier [16] under the name of C. tomentosa. The species is known in\r\nProvence, so this and that one tells me, by the name of the Cigalon, or\r\nrather Cigaloun, the Little Cigale or Cicada. This designation is\r\nunknown in my neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nI possess two other specimens which Réaumur probably confused with the\r\none of which he gives us a drawing. One is the Black Cicada (C. atra,\r\nOliv.), whom I came across only once; the other is the Pigmy Cicada (C.\r\npygmæa, Oliv.), whom I have picked up pretty often. I will say a few\r\nwords about this last one.\r\n\r\nHe is the smallest member of the genus in my district, the size of an\r\naverage Gad-fly, and measures about three-quarters of an inch in\r\nlength. His cymbals are transparent, with three opaque veins, are\r\nscarcely sheltered by a fold in the skin and are in full view, without\r\nany sort of entrance-lobby or sound-chamber. I may remark, in\r\nterminating our survey, that the entrance-lobby exists only in the\r\nCommon Cicada; all the others are without it.\r\n\r\nThe dampers are separated by a wide interval and allow the chapels to\r\nopen wide. The mirrors are comparatively large. Their shape suggests\r\nthe outline of a kidney-bean. The abdomen does not heave when the\r\ninsect sings; it remains stationary, like the Ash Cicada’s. Hence a\r\nlack of variety in the melody of both.\r\n\r\nThe Pigmy Cicada’s song is a monotonous rattle, pitched in a shrill\r\nkey, but faint and hardly perceptible a few steps away in the calm of\r\nour enervating July afternoons. If ever a fancy seized him to forsake\r\nhis sun-scorched bushes and to come and settle down in force in my cool\r\nplane-trees—and I wish that he would, for I should much like to study\r\nhim more closely—this pretty little Cicada would not disturb my\r\nsolitude as the frenzied Cacan does.\r\n\r\nWe have now ploughed our way through the descriptive part; we know the\r\ninstrument of sound so far as its structure is concerned. In\r\nconclusion, let us ask ourselves the object of these musical orgies.\r\nWhat is the use of all this noise? One reply is bound to come: it is\r\nthe call of the males summoning their mates; it is the lovers’ cantata.\r\n\r\nI will allow myself to discuss this answer, which is certainly a very\r\nnatural one. For fifteen years the Common Cicada and his shrill\r\nassociate, the Cacan, have thrust their society upon me. Every summer\r\nfor two months I have them before my eyes, I have them in my ears.\r\nThough I may not listen to them gladly, I observe them with a certain\r\nzeal. I see them ranged in rows on the smooth bark of the plane-trees,\r\nall with their heads upwards, both sexes interspersed with a few inches\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nWith their suckers driven into the tree, they drink, motionless. As the\r\nsun turns and moves the shadow, they also turn around the branch with\r\nslow lateral steps and make for the best-lighted and hottest surface.\r\nWhether they be working their suckers or moving their quarters, they\r\nnever cease singing.\r\n\r\nAre we to take the endless cantilena for a passionate call? I am not\r\nsure. In the assembly the two sexes are side by side; and you do not\r\nspend months on end in calling to some one who is at your elbow. Then\r\nagain, I never see a female come rushing into the midst of the very\r\nnoisiest orchestra. Sight is enough as a prelude to marriage here, for\r\nit is excellent; the wooer has no use for an everlasting declaration:\r\nthe wooed is his next-door neighbour.\r\n\r\nCould it be a means then of charming, of touching the indifferent one?\r\nI still have my doubts. I notice no signs of satisfaction in the\r\nfemales; I do not see them give the least flutter nor sway from side to\r\nside, though the lovers clash their cymbals never so loudly.\r\n\r\nMy neighbours the peasants say that, at harvest-time, the Cicada sings,\r\n“Sego, sego, sego! Reap, reap, reap!” to encourage them to work.\r\nWhether harvesters of wheat or harvesters of thought, we follow the\r\nsame occupation, one for the bread of the stomach, the other for the\r\nbread of the mind. I can understand their explanation, therefore; and I\r\naccept it as an instance of charming simplicity.\r\n\r\nScience asks for something better; but she finds in the insect a world\r\nthat is closed to us. There is no possibility of divining or even\r\nsuspecting the impression produced by the clash of the cymbals upon\r\nthose who inspire it. All that I can say is that their impassive\r\nexterior seems to denote complete indifference. Let us not insist too\r\nmuch: the private feelings of animals are an unfathomable mystery.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for doubt is this: those who are sensitive to music\r\nalways have delicate hearing; and this hearing, a watchful sentinel,\r\nshould give warning of any danger at the least sound. The birds, those\r\nskilled songsters, have an exquisitely fine sense of hearing. Should a\r\nleaf stir in the branches, should two wayfarers exchange a word, they\r\nwill be suddenly silent, anxious, on their guard. How far the Cicada is\r\nfrom such sensibility!\r\n\r\nHe has very clear sight. His large faceted eyes inform him of what\r\nhappens on the right and what happens on the left; his three stemmata,\r\nlike little ruby telescopes, explore the expanse above his head. The\r\nmoment he sees us coming, he is silent and flies away. But place\r\nyourself behind the branch on which he is singing, arrange so that you\r\nare not within reach of the five visual organs; and then talk, whistle,\r\nclap your hands, knock two stones together. For much less than this, a\r\nbird, though it would not see you, would interrupt its singing and fly\r\naway terrified. The imperturbable Cicada goes on rattling as though\r\nnothing were afoot.\r\n\r\nOf my experiments in this matter, I will mention only one, the most\r\nmemorable. I borrow the municipal artillery, that is to say, the\r\nmortars which are made to thunder forth on the feast of the\r\npatron-saint. The gunner is delighted to load them for the benefit of\r\nthe Cicadæ and to come and fire them off at my place. There are two of\r\nthem, crammed as though for the most solemn rejoicings. No politician\r\nmaking the circuit of his constituency in search of re-election was\r\never honoured with so much powder. We are careful to leave the windows\r\nopen, to save the panes from breaking. The two thundering engines are\r\nset at the foot of the plane-trees in front of my door. No precautions\r\nare taken to mask them: the Cicadæ singing in the branches overhead\r\ncannot see what is happening below.\r\n\r\nWe are an audience of six. We wait for a moment of comparative quiet.\r\nThe number of singers is checked by each of us, as are the depth and\r\nrhythm of the song. We are now ready, with ears pricked up to hear what\r\nwill happen in the aerial orchestra. The mortar is let off, with a\r\nnoise like a genuine thunder-clap.\r\n\r\nThere is no excitement whatever up above. The number of executants is\r\nthe same, the rhythm is the same, the volume of sound the same. The six\r\nwitnesses are unanimous: the mighty explosion has in no way affected\r\nthe song of the Cicadæ. And the second mortar gives an exactly similar\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nWhat conclusion are we to draw from this persistence of the orchestra,\r\nwhich is not at all surprised or put out by the firing of a gun? Am I\r\nto infer from it that the Cicada is deaf? I will certainly not venture\r\nso far as that; but, if any one else, more daring than I, were to make\r\nthe assertion, I should really not know what arguments to employ in\r\ncontradicting him. I should be obliged at least to concede that the\r\nCicada is extremely hard of hearing and that we may apply to him the\r\nfamiliar saying, to bawl like a deaf man.\r\n\r\nWhen the Blue-winged Locust takes his luxurious fill of sunshine on a\r\ngravelly path and with his great hind-shanks rubs the rough edge of his\r\nwing-cases; when the Green Tree-frog, suffering from as chronic a cold\r\nas the Cacan, swells his throat among the leaves and distends it into a\r\nresounding bladder at the approach of a storm, are they both calling to\r\ntheir absent mates? By no means. The bow-strokes of the first produce\r\nhardly a perceptible stridulation; the throaty exuberance of the second\r\nis no more effective: the object of their desire does not come.\r\n\r\nDoes the insect need these sonorous outbursts, these loquacious\r\navowals, to declare its flame? Consult the vast majority, whom the\r\nmeeting of the two sexes leaves silent. I see in the Grasshopper’s\r\nfiddle, the Tree-frog’s bagpipes and the cymbals of the Cacan but so\r\nmany methods of expressing the joy of living, the universal joy which\r\nevery animal species celebrates after its kind.\r\n\r\nIf any one were to tell me that the Cicadæ strum on their noisy\r\ninstruments without giving a thought to the sound produced and for the\r\nsheer pleasure of feeling themselves alive, just as we rub our hands in\r\na moment of satisfaction, I should not be greatly shocked. That there\r\nmay be also a secondary object in their concert, an object in which the\r\ndumb sex is interested, is quite possible, quite natural, though this\r\nhas not yet been proved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CICADA: THE LAYING AND THE HATCHING OF THE EGGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Common Cicada entrusts her eggs to small dry branches. All those\r\nwhich Réaumur examined and found to be thus tenanted were derived from\r\nthe mulberry-tree: a proof that the person commissioned to collect\r\nthese eggs in the Avignon district was very conservative in his methods\r\nof search. In addition to the mulberry-tree, I, on the other hand, find\r\nthem on the peach, the cherry, the willow, the Japanese privet and\r\nother trees. But these are exceptions. The Cicada really favours\r\nsomething different. She wants, as far as possible, tiny stalks, which\r\nmay be anything from the thickness of a straw to that of a lead-pencil,\r\nwith a thin ring of wood and plenty of pith. So long as these\r\nconditions are fulfilled, the actual plant matters little. I should\r\nhave to draw up a list of all the semiligneous flora of the district\r\nwere I to try and catalogue the different supports used by the Cicada\r\nwhen laying her eggs. I shall content myself with naming a few of them\r\nin a note, to show the variety of sites of which she avails herself.\r\n[17]\r\n\r\nThe sprig occupied is never lying on the ground; it is in a position\r\nmore or less akin to the perpendicular, most often in its natural\r\nplace, sometimes detached, but in that case sticking upright by\r\naccident. Preference is given to a good long stretch of smooth, even\r\nstalk, capable of accommodating the entire laying. My best harvests are\r\nmade on the sprigs of Spartium junceum, which are like straws crammed\r\nwith pith, and especially on the tall stalks of Asphodelus cerasiferus,\r\nwhich rise for nearly three feet before spreading into branches.\r\n\r\nThe rule is for the support, no matter what it is, to be dead and quite\r\ndry. Nevertheless my notes record a few instances of eggs confided to\r\nstalks that are still alive, with green leaves and flowers in bloom. It\r\nis true that, in these highly exceptional cases, the stalk itself is of\r\na pretty dry variety. [18]\r\n\r\nThe work performed by the Cicada consists of a series of pricks such as\r\nmight be made with a pin if it were driven downwards on a slant and\r\nmade to tear the ligneous fibres and force them up slightly. Any one\r\nseeing these dots without knowing what produced them would think first\r\nof some cryptogamous vegetation, some Sphæriacea swelling and bursting\r\nits skin under the growth of its half-emerging perithecia.\r\n\r\nIf the stalk be uneven, or if several Cicadæ have been working one\r\nafter the other at the same spot, the distribution of the punctures\r\nbecomes confused and the eye is apt to wander among them, unable to\r\nperceive either the order in which they were made or the work of each\r\nindividual. One characteristic is never missing, that is the slanting\r\ndirection of the woody strip ploughed up, which shows that the Cicada\r\nalways works in an upright position and drives her implement downwards\r\ninto the twig, in a longitudinal direction.\r\n\r\nIf the stalk be smooth and even and also of a suitable length, the\r\npunctures are nearly equidistant and are not far from being in a\r\nstraight line. Their number varies: it is small when the mother is\r\ndisturbed in her operation and goes off to continue her laying\r\nelsewhere; it amounts to thirty or forty when the line of dots\r\nrepresents the total amount of eggs laid. The actual length of the row\r\nfor the same number of thrusts likewise varies. A few examples will\r\nenlighten us in this respect: a row of thirty measures 28 centimetres\r\n[19] on the toad-flax, 30 [20] on the gum-succory and only 12 [21] on\r\nthe asphodel.\r\n\r\nDo not imagine that these variations in length have to do with the\r\nnature of the support: there are plenty of instances that prove the\r\ncontrary; and the asphodel, which in one case shows us the punctures\r\nthat are closest together, will in other cases show us those which are\r\nfarthest removed. The distance between the dots depends on\r\ncircumstances which cannot be explained, but especially on the caprice\r\nof the mother, who concentrates her laying more at one spot and less at\r\nanother according to her fancy. I have found the average measurement\r\nbetween one hole and the next to be 8 to 10 millimetres. [22]\r\n\r\nEach of these abrasions is the entrance to a slanting cell, usually\r\nbored in the pithy portion of the stalk. This entrance is not closed,\r\nsave by the bunch of ligneous fibres which are parted at the time of\r\nthe laying but which come together again when the double saw of the\r\novipositor is withdrawn. At most, in certain cases, but not always, you\r\nsee gleaming through the threads of this barricade a tiny glistening\r\nspeck, looking like a glaze of dried albumen. This can be only an\r\ninsignificant trace of some albuminous secretion which accompanies the\r\neggs or else facilitates the play of the double boring-file.\r\n\r\nJust under the prick lies the cell, a very narrow passage which\r\noccupies almost the entire distance between its pin-hole and that of\r\nthe preceding cell. Sometimes even there is no partition separating the\r\ntwo; the upper floor runs into the lower; and the eggs, though inserted\r\nthrough several entrances, are arranged in an uninterrupted row.\r\nUsually, however, the cells are distinct.\r\n\r\nTheir contents vary greatly. I count from six to fifteen eggs in each.\r\nThe average is ten. As the number of cells of a complete laying is\r\nbetween thirty and forty, we see that the Cicada disposes of three to\r\nfour hundred eggs. Réaumur arrived at the same figures from his\r\nexamination of the ovaries.\r\n\r\nA fine family truly, capable by sheer numbers of coping with very grave\r\nrisks of destruction. Yet I do not see that the adult Cicada is in\r\ngreater danger than any other insect: he has a vigilant eye, can get\r\nstarted quickly, is a rapid flyer and inhabits heights at which the\r\ncut-throats of the meadows are not to be feared. The Sparrow, it is\r\ntrue, is very fond of him. From time to time, after careful strategy,\r\nthe enemy swoops upon the plane-trees from the neighbouring roof and\r\ngrabs the frenzied fiddler. A few pecks distributed right and left cut\r\nhim up into quarters, which form delicious morsels for the nestlings.\r\nBut how often does not the bird return with an empty bag! The wary\r\nCicada sees the attack coming, empties his bladder into his assailant’s\r\neyes and decamps.\r\n\r\nNo, it is not the Sparrow that makes it necessary for the Cicada to\r\ngive birth to so numerous a progeny. The danger lies elsewhere. We\r\nshall see how terrible it can be at hatching- and also at laying-time.\r\n\r\nTwo or three weeks after the emergence from the ground, that is to say,\r\nabout the middle of July, the Cicada busies herself with her eggs. In\r\norder to witness the laying without trusting too much to luck, I had\r\ntaken certain precautions which seemed to me to assure success. The\r\ninsect’s favourite support is the dry asphodel: I had learnt that from\r\nearlier observations. This plant is also the one that lends itself best\r\nto my plans, owing to its long, smooth stalk. Now, during the first\r\nyears of my residence here, I replaced the thistles in my enclosure by\r\nother native plants, of a less forbidding character. The asphodel is\r\namong the new occupants and is just what I want to-day. I therefore\r\nleave last year’s dry stalks where they are; and, when the proper\r\nseason comes, I inspect them daily.\r\n\r\nI have not long to wait. As early as the 15th of July, I find as many\r\nCicadæ as I could wish installed on the asphodels, busily laying. The\r\nmother is always alone. Each has a stalk to herself, without fear of\r\nany competition that might disturb the delicate process of inoculation.\r\nWhen the first occupant is gone, another may come, followed by others\r\nyet. There is ample room for all; but each in succession wishes to be\r\nalone. For the rest, there is no quarrelling among them; things happen\r\nmost peacefully. If some mother appears and finds the place already\r\ntaken, she flies away so soon as she discovers her mistake and looks\r\naround elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Cicada, when laying, always carries her head upwards, an attitude\r\nwhich, for that matter, she adopts in other circumstances. She lets you\r\nexamine her quite closely, even under the magnifying-glass, so greatly\r\nabsorbed is she in her task. The ovipositor, which is about two-fifths\r\nof an inch long, is buried in the stalk, slantwise. So perfect is the\r\ntool that the boring does not seem to call for very laborious\r\noperations. I see the mother give a jerk or two and dilate and contract\r\nthe tip of her abdomen with frequent palpitations. That is all. The\r\ndrill with its double gimlets working alternately digs and disappears\r\ninto the wood, with a gentle and almost imperceptible movement. Nothing\r\nparticular happens during the laying. The insect is motionless. Ten\r\nminutes or so elapse between the first bite of the tool and the\r\ncomplete filling of the cell.\r\n\r\nThe ovipositor is then withdrawn with deliberate slowness, so as not to\r\nwarp it. The boring-hole closes of itself, as the ligneous fibres come\r\ntogether again, and the insect climbs a little higher, about as far as\r\nthe length of its instrument, in a straight line. Here we see a new\r\npunch of the gimlet and a new chamber receiving its half-a-score of\r\neggs. In this fashion the laying works its way up from bottom to top.\r\n\r\nOnce we know these facts, we are in a position to understand the\r\nremarkable arrangement controlling the work. The punctures, the\r\nentrances to the cells, are almost equidistant, because each time the\r\nCicada ascends about the same height, roughly the length of her\r\novipositor. Very rapid in flight, she is a very lazy walker. All that\r\nyou ever see her do on the live branch on which she drinks is to move\r\nto a sunnier spot close by, with a grave and almost solemn step. On the\r\ndead branch where the eggs are laid she retains her leisurely habits,\r\neven exaggerating them, in view of the importance of the operation. She\r\nmoves as little as need be, shifting her place only just enough to\r\navoid letting two adjoining cells encroach upon each other. The measure\r\nof the upward movement is provided approximately by the length of the\r\nbore.\r\n\r\nAlso the holes are arranged in a straight line when their number is not\r\ngreat. Why indeed should the laying mother veer to the left or right on\r\na stalk which has the same qualities all over? Loving the sun, she has\r\nselected the side of the stalk that is most exposed to it. So long as\r\nshe feels on her back a douche of heat, her supreme joy, she will take\r\ngood care not to leave the situation which she considers so delightful\r\nfor another upon which the sun’s rays do not fall so directly.\r\n\r\nBut the laying takes a long time when it is all performed on the same\r\nsupport. Allowing ten minutes to a cell, the series of forty which I\r\nhave sometimes seen represents a period of six to seven hours. The sun\r\ntherefore can alter its position considerably before the Cicada has\r\nfinished her work. In that case the rectilinear direction becomes bent\r\ninto a spiral curve. The mother turns around her stalk as the sun\r\nitself turns; and her row of pricks suggests the course of the gnomon’s\r\nshadow on a cylindrical sundial.\r\n\r\nVery often, while the Cicada is absorbed in her work of motherhood, an\r\ninfinitesimal Gnat, herself the bearer of a boring-tool, labours to\r\nexterminate the eggs as fast as they are placed. Réaumur knew her. In\r\nnearly every bit of stick that he examined he found her grub, which\r\ncaused him to make a mistake at the beginning of his researches. But he\r\ndid not see, he could not see the impudent ravager at work. It is a\r\nChalcidid some four to five millimetres [23] in length, all black, with\r\nknotty antennæ, thickening a little towards their tips. The unsheathed\r\nboring-tool is planted in the under part of the abdomen, near the\r\nmiddle, and sticks out at right angles to the body, as in the case of\r\nthe Leucospes, [24] the scourge of certain members of the Bee-tribe.\r\nHaving neglected to capture the insect, I do not know what name the\r\nnomenclators have bestowed upon it, if indeed the dwarf that\r\nexterminates Cicadæ has been catalogued at all.\r\n\r\nWhat I do know something about is its calm temerity, its brazen\r\naudacity in the immediate presence of the colossus who could crush it\r\nby simply stepping on it. I have seen as many as three exploiting the\r\nunhappy mother at the same time. They keep close behind each other,\r\neither working their probes or awaiting the propitious moment.\r\n\r\nThe Cicada has just stocked a cell and is climbing a little higher to\r\nbore the next. One of the brigands runs to the abandoned spot; and\r\nhere, almost under the claws of the giantess, without the least fear,\r\nas though she were at home and accomplishing a meritorious act, she\r\nunsheathes her probe and inserts it into the column of eggs, not\r\nthrough the hole already made, which bristles with broken fibres, but\r\nthrough some lateral crevice. The tool works slowly, because of the\r\nresistance of the wood, which is almost intact. The Cicada has time to\r\nstock the next floor above.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she has finished, a Gnat standing immediately behind her,\r\nwaiting to perform her task, takes her place and comes and introduces\r\nher own exterminating germ. By the time that the mother has exhausted\r\nher ovaries and flies away, most of her cells have, in this fashion,\r\nreceived the alien egg which will be the ruin of their contents. A\r\nsmall, quick-hatching grub, one only to each chamber, generously fed on\r\na round dozen raw eggs, will take the place of the Cicada’s family.\r\n\r\nO deplorable mother, have centuries of experience taught you nothing?\r\nSurely, with those excellent eyes of yours, you cannot fail to see the\r\nterrible sappers, when they flutter around you, preparing their felon\r\nstroke! You see them, you know that they are at your heels; and you\r\nremain impassive and let yourself be victimized. Turn round, you\r\neasy-going colossus, and crush the pigmies! But you will do nothing of\r\nthe sort: you are incapable of altering your instincts, even to lighten\r\nyour share of maternal sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe Common Cicada’s eggs are of a gleaming ivory-white. Elongated in\r\nshape and conical at both ends, they might be compared with miniature\r\nweavers’-shuttles. They are two millimetres and a half long by half a\r\nmillimetre wide. [25] They are arranged in a row, slightly overlapping.\r\nThe Ash Cicada’s, which are a trifle smaller, are packed in regular\r\nparcels mimicking microscopic bundles of cigars. We will devote our\r\nattention exclusively to the first; their story will tell us that of\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nSeptember is not over before the gleaming ivory-white gives place to\r\nstraw-colour. In the early days of October there appear, in the front\r\npart, two little dark-brown spots, round and clearly-defined, which are\r\nthe ocular specks of the tiny creature in course of formation. These\r\ntwo shining eyes, which almost look at you, combined with the\r\ncone-shaped fore-end, give the eggs an appearance of finless fishes,\r\nthe very tiniest of fishes, for which a walnut-shell would make a\r\nsuitable bowl.\r\n\r\nAbout the same period, I often see on my asphodels and those on the\r\nhills around indications of a recent hatching. These indications take\r\nthe form of certain discarded clothes, certain rags left on the\r\nthreshold by the new-born grubs moving their quarters and eager to\r\nreach a new lodging. We shall learn in an instant what these cast skins\r\nmean.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of my visits, which were assiduous enough to\r\ndeserve a better result, I have never succeeded in seeing the young\r\nCicadæ come out of their cells. My home breeding prospers no better.\r\nFor two years running, at the right time, I collect in boxes, tubes and\r\njars a hundred twigs of all sorts colonized with Cicada-eggs; not one\r\nof them shows me what I am so anxious to see, the emergence of the\r\nbudding Cicadæ.\r\n\r\nRéaumur experienced the same disappointment. He tells us how all the\r\neggs sent by his friends proved failures, even when he carried them in\r\na glass tube in his fob to give them a mild temperature. O my revered\r\nmaster, neither the warm shelter of our studies nor the niggardly\r\nheating-apparatus of our breeches is enough in this case! What is\r\nneeded is that supreme stimulant, the kisses of the sun; what is\r\nneeded, after the morning coolness, which already is sharp enough to\r\nmake us shiver, is the sudden glow of a glorious autumn day, summer’s\r\nlast farewell.\r\n\r\nIt was in such circumstances as these, when a bright sun supplied a\r\nviolent contrast to a cold night, that I used to find signs of\r\nhatching; but I always came too late: the young Cicadæ were gone. At\r\nmost I sometimes happened to find one hanging by a thread from his\r\nnative stalk and struggling in mid-air. I thought him caught in some\r\nshred of cobweb.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 27th of October, despairing of success, I gathered the\r\nasphodels in the enclosure and, taking the armful of dry stalks on\r\nwhich the Cicada had laid, carried it up to my study. Before abandoning\r\nall hope, I proposed once more to examine the cells and their contents.\r\nIt was a cold morning. The first fire of the season had been lit. I put\r\nmy little bundle on a chair in front the hearth, without any intention\r\nof trying the effect of the hot flames upon the nests. The sticks which\r\nI meant to split open one by one were within easier reach of my hand\r\nthere. That was the only consideration which made me choose that\r\nparticular spot.\r\n\r\nWell, while I was passing my magnifying-glass over a split stem, the\r\nhatching which I no longer hoped to see suddenly took place beside me.\r\nMy bundle became alive; the young larvæ emerged from their cells by the\r\ndozen. Their number was so great that my professional instincts were\r\namply satisfied. The eggs were exactly ripe; and the blaze on the\r\nhearth, bright and penetrating, produced the same effect as sunlight\r\nout of doors. I lost no time in profiting by this unexpected stroke of\r\nluck.\r\n\r\nAt the aperture of the egg-chamber, among the torn fibres, a tiny\r\ncone-shaped body appears, with two large black eye-spots. To look at,\r\nit is absolutely the fore-part of the egg, which, as I have said,\r\nresembles the front of a very minute fish. One would think that the egg\r\nhad changed its position, climbing from the bottom of the basin to the\r\norifice of the little passage. But an egg to move! A germ to start\r\nwalking! Such a thing was impossible, had never been known; I must be\r\nsuffering from an illusion. I split open the stalk; and the mystery is\r\nrevealed. The real eggs, though a little disarranged, have not changed\r\ntheir position. They are empty, reduced to transparent bags, torn\r\nconsiderably at their fore-ends. From them has issued the very singular\r\norganism whose salient characteristics I will now set forth.\r\n\r\nIn its general shape, the configuration of the head and the large black\r\neyes, the creature, even more than the egg, presents the appearance of\r\nan extremely small fish. A mock ventral fin accentuates the likeness.\r\nThis sort of oar comes from the fore-legs, which, cased in a special\r\nsheath, lie backwards, stretched against each other in a straight line.\r\nIts feeble power of movement must help the grub to come out of the\r\negg-shell and—a more difficult matter—out of the fibrous passage.\r\nWithdrawing a little way from the body and then returning, this lever\r\nprovides a purchase for progression by means of the terminal claws,\r\nwhich are already well-developed. The four other legs are still wrapped\r\nin the common envelope and are absolutely inert. This applies also to\r\nthe antennæ, which can hardly be perceived through the lens.\r\nAltogether, the organism newly issued from the egg is an exceedingly\r\nsmall, boat-shaped body, with a single oar pointing backwards on the\r\nventral surface and formed of the two fore-legs joined together. The\r\nsegmentation is very clearly marked, especially on the abdomen. Lastly,\r\nthe whole thing is quite smooth, with not a hair on it.\r\n\r\nWhat name shall I give to this initial state of the Cicada, a state so\r\nstrange and unforeseen and hitherto unsuspected? Must I knock Greek\r\nwords together and fashion some uncouth expression? I shall do nothing\r\nof the sort, convinced as I am that barbarous terms are only a cumbrous\r\nimpediment to science. I shall simply call it “the primary larva,” as I\r\ndid in the case of the Oil-beetles, the Leucospes and the Anthrax. [26]\r\n\r\nThe form of the primary larva in the Cicadæ is eminently well-suited\r\nfor the emergence. The passage in which the egg is hatched is very\r\nnarrow and leaves just room for one to go out. Besides, the eggs are\r\narranged in a row, not end to end, but partly overlapping. The creature\r\ncoming from the farther ranks has to make its way through the remains\r\nof the eggs already hatched in front of it. To the narrowness of the\r\ncorridor is added the block caused by the empty shells.\r\n\r\nIn these conditions, the larva in the form which it will have\r\npresently, when it has torn its temporary scabbard, would not be able\r\nto clear the difficult pass. Irksome antennæ, long legs spreading far\r\nfrom the axis of the body, picks with curved and pointed ends that\r\ncatch on the road: all these are in the way of a speedy deliverance.\r\nThe eggs in one cell hatch almost simultaneously. It is necessary that\r\nthe new-born grubs in front should move out as fast as they can and\r\nmake room for those behind. This necessitates the smooth, boatlike\r\nform, devoid of all projections, which makes its way insinuatingly,\r\nlike a wedge. The primary larva, with its different appendages closely\r\nfixed to its body inside a common sheath, with its boat shape and its\r\nsingle oar possessing a certain power of movement, has its part to\r\nplay: its business is to emerge into daylight through a difficult\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nIts task is soon done. Here comes one of the emigrants, showing its\r\nhead with the great eyes and lifting the broken fibres of the aperture.\r\nIt works its way farther and farther out, with a progressive movement\r\nso slow that the lens does not easily perceive it. In half an hour at\r\nsoonest, the boat-shaped object appears entirely; but it is still\r\ncaught by its hinder end in the exit-hole.\r\n\r\nThe emergence-jacket splits without further delay; and the creature\r\nsheds its skin from front to back. It is now the normal larva, the only\r\none that Réaumur knew. The cast slough forms a suspensory thread,\r\nexpanding into a little cup at its free end. In this cup is contained\r\nthe tip of the abdomen of the larva, which, before dropping to the\r\nground, treats itself to a sun-bath, hardens itself, kicks about and\r\ntries its strength, swinging indolently at the end of its life-line.\r\n\r\nThis “little Flea,” as Réaumur calls it, first white, then amber, is at\r\nall points the larva that will dig into the ground. The antennæ, of\r\nfair length, are free and wave about; the legs work their joints; those\r\nin front open and shut their claws, which are the strongest part of\r\nthem. I know hardly any more curious sight than that of this miniature\r\ngymnast hanging by its hinder-part, swinging at the least breath of\r\nwind and making ready in the air for its somersault into the world. The\r\nperiod of suspension varies. Some larvæ let themselves drop in half an\r\nhour or so; others remain for hours in their long-stemmed cup; and some\r\neven wait until the next day.\r\n\r\nWhether quick or slow, the creature’s fall leaves the cord, the slough\r\nof the primary larva, swinging. When the whole brood has disappeared,\r\nthe orifice of the cell is thus hung with a cluster of short, fine\r\nthreads, twisted and rumpled, like dried white of egg. Each opens into\r\na little cup at its free end. They are very delicate and ephemeral\r\nrelics, which you cannot touch without destroying them. The slightest\r\nwind soon blows them away.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the larva. Sooner or later, without losing much time,\r\nit drops to the ground, either by accident or of its own accord. The\r\ninfinitesimal creature, no bigger than a Flea, has saved its tender,\r\nbudding flesh from the rough earth by swinging on its cord. It has\r\nhardened itself in the air, that luxurious eiderdown. It now plunges\r\ninto the stern realities of life.\r\n\r\nI see a thousand dangers ahead of it. The merest breath of wind can\r\nblow the atom here, on the impenetrable rock, or there, on the ocean of\r\na rut where a little water stagnates, or elsewhere, on the sand, the\r\nstarvation region where nothing grows, or again on a clay soil, too\r\ntough for digging. These fatal expanses are frequent; and so are the\r\ngusts that blow one away in this windy season which has already set in\r\nunpleasantly by the end of October.\r\n\r\nThe feeble creature needs very soft soil, easily entered, so as to\r\nobtain shelter immediately. The cold days are drawing nigh; the frosts\r\nare coming. To wander about on the surface of the ground for any length\r\nof time would expose us to grave dangers. We had better descend into\r\nthe earth without delay; and that to a good depth. This one imperative\r\ncondition of safety is in many cases impossible to realize. What can\r\nlittle Flea’s-claws do against rock, flint or hardened clay? The tiny\r\ncreature must perish unless it can find an underground refuge in time.\r\n\r\nThe first establishment, which is exposed to so many evil chances, is,\r\nso everything shows us, a cause of great mortality in the Cicada’s\r\nfamily. Already the little black parasite, the destroyer of the eggs,\r\nhas told us how expedient it is for the mothers to accomplish a long\r\nand fertile laying; the difficulties attendant upon the initial\r\ninstallation in their turn explain why the maintenance of the race at\r\nits suitable strength requires three or four hundred eggs to be laid by\r\neach of them. Subject to excessive spoliation, the Cicada is fertile to\r\nexcess. She averts by the richness of her ovaries the multitude of\r\ndangers threatening her.\r\n\r\nIn the experiment which it remains for me to make, I will at least\r\nspare the larva the difficulties of the first installation. I select\r\nsome very soft, very black heath-mould and pass it through a fine\r\nsieve. Its dark colour will enable me more easily to find the little\r\nyellow creature when I want to see what is happening; and its softness\r\nwill suit the feeble mattock. I heap it not too tightly in a glass pot;\r\nI plant a little tuft of thyme in it; I sow a few grains of wheat.\r\nThere is no hole at the bottom of the pot, though there ought to be, if\r\nthe thyme and the wheat are to thrive; the captives, however, finding\r\nthe hole, would be certain to escape through it. The plantation will\r\nsuffer from this lack of drainage; but at least I am certain of finding\r\nmy animals with the aid of my magnifying-glass and plenty of patience.\r\nBesides, I shall indulge in no excesses in the matter of irrigation,\r\nsupplying only enough water to prevent the plants from dying.\r\n\r\nWhen everything is ready and the corn is beginning to put forth its\r\nfirst shoots, I place six young Cicada-larvæ on the surface of the\r\nsoil. The puny grubs run about and explore the earthy bed pretty\r\nnimbly; some make unsuccessful attempts to climb the side of the pot.\r\nNot one seems inclined to bury itself, so much so that I anxiously\r\nwonder what the object can be of these active and prolonged\r\ninvestigations. Two hours pass and the restless roaming never ceases.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that they want? Food? I offer them some little bulbs with\r\nbundles of sprouting roots, a few bits of leaves and some fresh blades\r\nof grass. Nothing tempts them nor induces them to stand still. They\r\nappear to be selecting a favourable spot before descending underground.\r\nThese hesitating explorations are superfluous on the soil which I have\r\nindustriously prepared for them: the whole surface, so it seems to me,\r\nlends itself capitally to the work which I expect to see them\r\naccomplish. Apparently it is not enough.\r\n\r\nUnder natural conditions, a preliminary run round may well be\r\nindispensable. There, sites as soft as my bed of heath-mould, purged of\r\nall hard bodies and finely sifted, are rare. There, on the other hand,\r\ncoarse soils, on which the microscopic mattock can make no impression,\r\nare frequent. The grub has to roam at random, to walk about for some\r\ntime before finding a suitable place. No doubt many even die, exhausted\r\nby their fruitless search. A journey of exploration, in a country a few\r\ninches across, forms part, therefore, of the young Cicada’s curriculum.\r\nIn my glass jar, so sumptuously furnished, the pilgrimage is uncalled\r\nfor. No matter: it has to be performed according to the time-honoured\r\nrites.\r\n\r\nMy gadabouts at last grow calm. I see them attack the earth with the\r\nhooked mattocks of their fore-feet, digging into it and making the sort\r\nof excavation which the point of a thick needle would produce. Armed\r\nwith a magnifying-glass, I watch them wielding their pick-axes, watch\r\nthem raking an atom of earth to the surface. In a few minutes a well\r\nhas been scooped out. The little creature goes down it, buries itself\r\nand is henceforth invisible.\r\n\r\nNext day I turn out the contents of the pot, without breaking the clod\r\nheld together by the roots of the thyme and the wheat. I find all my\r\nlarvæ at the bottom, stopped from going farther by the glass. In\r\ntwenty-four hours they have traversed the entire thickness of the layer\r\nof earth, about four inches. They would have gone even lower but for\r\nthe obstacle at the bottom.\r\n\r\nOn their way they probably came across my thyme- and wheat-roots. Did\r\nthey stop to take a little nourishment by driving in their suckers? It\r\nis hardly probable. A few of these rootlets are trailing at the bottom\r\nof the empty pot. Not one of my six prisoners is installed on them.\r\nPerhaps in overturning the glass I have shaken them off.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that underground there can be no other food for them than\r\nthe juice of the roots. Whether full-grown or in the larval stage, the\r\nCicada lives on vegetables. As an adult, he drinks the sap of the\r\nbranches; as a larva, he sucks the sap of the roots. But at what moment\r\nis the first sip taken? This I do not yet know. What goes before seems\r\nto tell us that the newly-hatched grub is in a greater hurry to reach\r\nthe depths of the soil, sheltered from the coming colds of winter, than\r\nto loiter at the drinking-bars encountered on the way.\r\n\r\nI put back the clod of heath-mould and for the second time place the\r\nsix exhumed larvæ on the surface of the soil. Wells are dug without\r\ndelay. The grubs disappear down them. Finally I put the pot in my\r\nstudy-window, where it will receive all the influences of the outer\r\nair, good and bad alike.\r\n\r\nA month later, at the end of November, I make a second inspection. The\r\nyoung Cicadæ are crouching, each by itself, at the bottom of the clod\r\nof earth. They are not clinging to the roots; they have not altered in\r\nappearance or in size. I find them now just as I saw them at the\r\nbeginning of the experiment, only a little less active. Does not this\r\nabsence of growth during the interval of November, the mildest month of\r\nwinter, seem to show that no nourishment is taken throughout the cold\r\nseason?\r\n\r\nThe young Sitaris-beetles, [27] those other animated atoms, as soon as\r\nthey issue from the egg at the entrance to the Anthophora’s [28]\r\ngalleries, remain in motionless heaps and spend the winter in complete\r\nabstinence. The little Cicadæ would appear to behave in much the same\r\nmanner. Once buried in depths where there is no fear of frosts, they\r\nsleep, solitary, in their winter-quarters and await the return of\r\nspring before broaching some root near by and taking their first\r\nrefreshment.\r\n\r\nI have tried, but without success, to confirm by actual observation the\r\ninferences to be drawn from the above results. In the spring, in April,\r\nfor the third time I unpot my plantation. I break up the clod and\r\nscrutinize it under the magnifying-glass. I feel as if I were looking\r\nfor a needle in a haystack. At last I find my little Cicadæ. They are\r\ndead, perhaps of cold, notwithstanding the bell-glass with which I had\r\ncovered the pot; perhaps of starvation, if the thyme did not suit them.\r\nThe problem is too difficult to solve; I give it up.\r\n\r\nTo succeed in this attempt at rearing one would need a very wide and\r\ndeep bed of earth, providing a shelter from the rigours of winter, and,\r\nbecause I do not know which are the insect’s favourite roots, there\r\nwould also have to be a varied vegetation, in which the little larvæ\r\ncould choose according to their tastes. These conditions are quite\r\npracticable; but how is one afterwards to find in that huge mass of\r\nearth, measuring a cubic yard at least, the atom which I have so much\r\ntrouble in distinguishing in a handful of black mould? And, besides,\r\nsuch conscientious digging would certainly detach the tiny creature\r\nfrom the root that nourishes it.\r\n\r\nThe underground life of the early Cicada remains a secret. That of the\r\nwell-developed larva is no better-known. When digging in the fields, if\r\nyou turn up the soil to any depth, you are constantly finding the\r\nfierce little burrower under your spade; but to find it fastened to the\r\nroots from whose sap it undoubtedly derives its nourishment is quite\r\nanother matter. The upheaval occasioned by the spade warns it of its\r\ndanger. It releases its sucker and retreats to some gallery; and, when\r\ndiscovered, it is no longer drinking.\r\n\r\nIf agricultural digging, with its inevitable disturbances, is unable to\r\ntell us anything of the grub’s underground habits, it does at least\r\ninform us how long the larval stage lasts. Some obliging husbandmen,\r\nbreaking up their land, in March, rather deeper than usual, were so\r\nvery good as to pick up for me all the larvæ, big and small, unearthed\r\nby their labour. The harvest amounted to several hundreds. Marked\r\ndifferences in bulk divided the total into three classes: the large\r\nones, with rudiments of wings similar to those possessed by the larvæ\r\nleaving the ground, the medium-sized and the small. Each of these\r\nclasses must correspond with a different age. We will add to them the\r\nlarvæ of the last hatching, microscopic creatures that necessarily\r\nescaped the eyes of my rustic collaborators; and we arrive at four\r\nyears as the probable duration of the underground life of the Cicadæ.\r\n\r\nTheir existence in the air is more easily calculated. I hear the first\r\nCicadæ at the approach of the summer solstice. The orchestra attains\r\nits full strength a month later. A few laggards, very few and very far\r\nbetween, continue to execute their faint solos until the middle of\r\nSeptember. That is the end of the concert. As they do not all come out\r\nof the ground at the same period, it is obvious that the singers of\r\nSeptember are not contemporary with those of June. If we strike an\r\naverage between these two extreme dates, we shall have about five\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nFour years of hard work underground and a month of revelry in the sun:\r\nthis then represents the Cicada’s life. Let us no longer blame the\r\nadult for his delirious triumph. For four years, in the darkness, he\r\nhas worn a dirty parchment smock; for four years he has dug the earth\r\nwith his mattocks; and behold the mud-stained navvy suddenly attired in\r\nexquisite raiment, possessed of wings that rival the bird’s, drunk with\r\nthe heat and inundated with light, the supreme joy of this world! What\r\ncymbals could ever be loud enough to celebrate such felicity, so richly\r\nearned and so ephemeral!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE MANTIS: HER HUNTING\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother creature of the south, at least as interesting as the Cicada,\r\nbut much less famous, because it makes no noise. Had Heaven granted it\r\na pair of cymbals, the one thing needed, its renown would eclipse the\r\ngreat musician’s, for it is most unusual in both shape and habits. Folk\r\nhereabouts call it lou Prègo-Diéu, the animal that prays to God. Its\r\nofficial name is the Praying Mantis (M. religiosa, Lin.).\r\n\r\nThe language of science and the peasant’s artless vocabulary agree in\r\nthis case and represent the queer creature as a pythoness delivering\r\nher oracles or an ascetic rapt in pious ecstasy. The comparison dates a\r\nlong way back. Even in the time of the Greeks the insect was called\r\nΜάντις, the divine, the prophet. The tiller of the soil is not\r\nparticular about analogies: where points of resemblance are not too\r\nclear, he will make up for their deficiencies. He saw on the\r\nsun-scorched herbage an insect of imposing appearance, drawn up\r\nmajestically in a half-erect posture. He noticed its gossamer wings,\r\nbroad and green, trailing like long veils of finest lawn; he saw its\r\nfore-legs, its arms so to speak, raised to the sky in a gesture of\r\ninvocation. That was enough; popular imagination did the rest; and\r\nbehold the bushes from ancient times stocked with Delphic priestesses,\r\nwith nuns in orison.\r\n\r\nGood people, with your childish simplicity, how great was your mistake!\r\nThose sanctimonious airs are a mask for Satanic habits; those arms\r\nfolded in prayer are cut-throat weapons: they tell no beads, they slay\r\nwhatever passes within range. Forming an exception which one would\r\nnever have suspected in the herbivorous order of the Orthoptera, the\r\nMantis feeds exclusively on living prey. She is the tigress of the\r\npeaceable entomological tribes, the ogress in ambush who levies a\r\ntribute of fresh meat. Picture her with sufficient strength; and her\r\ncarnivorous appetites, combined with her traps of horrible perfection,\r\nwould make her the terror of the country-side. The Prègo-Diéu would\r\nbecome a devilish vampire.\r\n\r\nApart from her lethal implement, the Mantis has nothing to inspire\r\ndread. She is not without a certain beauty, in fact, with her slender\r\nfigure, her elegant bust, her pale-green colouring and her long gauze\r\nwings. No ferocious mandibles, opening like shears; on the contrary, a\r\ndainty pointed muzzle that seems made for billing and cooing. Thanks to\r\na flexible neck, quite independent of the thorax, the head is able to\r\nmove freely, to turn to right or left, to bend, to lift itself. Alone\r\namong insects, the Mantis directs her gaze; she inspects and examines;\r\nshe almost has a physiognomy.\r\n\r\nGreat indeed is the contrast between the body as a whole, with its very\r\npacific aspect, and the murderous mechanism of the fore-legs, which are\r\ncorrectly described as raptorial. The haunch is uncommonly long and\r\npowerful. Its function is to throw forward the rat-trap, which does not\r\nawait its victim but goes in search of it. The snare is decked out with\r\nsome show of finery. The base of the haunch is adorned on the inner\r\nsurface with a pretty, black mark, having a white spot in the middle;\r\nand a few rows of bead-like dots complete the ornamentation.\r\n\r\nThe thigh, longer still, a sort of flattened spindle, carries on the\r\nfront half of its lower surface two rows of sharp spikes. In the inner\r\nrow there are a dozen, alternately black and green, the green being\r\nshorter than the black. This alternation of unequal lengths increases\r\nthe number of cogs and improves the effectiveness of the weapon. The\r\nouter row is simpler and has only four teeth. Lastly, three spurs, the\r\nlongest of all, stand out behind the two rows. In short, the thigh is a\r\nsaw with two parallel blades, separated by a groove in which the leg\r\nlies when folded back.\r\n\r\nThe leg, which moves very easily on its joint with the thigh, is\r\nlikewise a double-edged saw. The teeth are smaller, more numerous and\r\ncloser together than those on the thigh. It ends in a strong hook whose\r\npoint vies with the finest needle for sharpness, a hook fluted\r\nunderneath and having a double blade like a curved pruning-knife.\r\n\r\nThis hook, a most perfect instrument for piercing and tearing, has left\r\nme many a painful memory. How often, when Mantis-hunting, clawed by the\r\ninsect which I had just caught and not having both hands at liberty,\r\nhave I been obliged to ask somebody else to release me from my\r\ntenacious captive! To try to free yourself by force, without first\r\ndisengaging the claws implanted in your flesh, would expose you to\r\nscratches similar to those produced by the thorns of a rose-tree. None\r\nof our insects is so troublesome to handle. The Mantis claws you with\r\nher pruning-hooks, pricks you with her spikes, seizes you in her vice\r\nand makes self-defence almost impossible if, wishing to keep your prize\r\nalive, you refrain from giving the pinch of the thumb that would put an\r\nend to the struggle by crushing the creature.\r\n\r\nWhen at rest, the trap is folded and pressed back against the chest and\r\nlooks quite harmless. There you have the insect praying. But, should a\r\nvictim pass, the attitude of prayer is dropped abruptly. Suddenly\r\nunfolded, the three long sections of the machine throw to a distance\r\ntheir terminal grapnel, which harpoons the prey and, in returning,\r\ndraws it back between the two saws. The vice closes with a movement\r\nlike that of the fore-arm and the upper arm; and all is over: Locusts,\r\nGrasshoppers and others even more powerful, once caught in the\r\nmechanism with its four rows of teeth, are irretrievably lost. Neither\r\ntheir desperate fluttering nor their kicking will make the terrible\r\nengine release its hold.\r\n\r\nAn uninterrupted study of the Mantis’ habits is not practicable in the\r\nopen fields; we must rear her at home. There is no difficulty about\r\nthis: she does not mind being interned under glass, on condition that\r\nshe be well fed. Offer her choice viands, served up fresh daily, and\r\nshe will hardly feel her absence from the bushes.\r\n\r\nAs cages for my captives I have some ten large wire-gauze dish-covers,\r\nthe same that are used to protect meat from the Flies. Each stands in a\r\npan filled with sand. A dry tuft of thyme and a flat stone on which the\r\nlaying may be done later constitute all the furniture. These huts are\r\nplaced in a row on the large table in my insect laboratory, where the\r\nsun shines on them for the best part of the day. I instal my captives\r\nin them, some singly, some in groups.\r\n\r\nIt is in the second fortnight of August that I begin to come upon the\r\nadult Mantis in the withered grass and on the brambles by the\r\nroad-side. The females, already notably corpulent, are more frequent\r\nfrom day to day. Their slender companions, on the other hand, are\r\nrather scarce; and I sometimes have a good deal of difficulty in making\r\nup my couples, for there is an appalling consumption of these dwarfs in\r\nthe cages. Let us keep these atrocities for later and speak first of\r\nthe females.\r\n\r\nThey are great eaters, whose maintenance, when it has to last for some\r\nmonths, is none too easy. The provisions, which are nibbled at\r\ndisdainfully and nearly all wasted, have to be renewed almost every\r\nday. I trust that the Mantis is more economical on her native bushes.\r\nWhen game is not plentiful, no doubt she devours every atom of her\r\ncatch; in my cages she is extravagant, often dropping and abandoning\r\nthe rich morsel after a few mouthfuls, without deriving any further\r\nbenefit from it. This appears to be her particular method of beguiling\r\nthe tedium of captivity.\r\n\r\nTo cope with these extravagant ways I have to employ assistants. Two or\r\nthree small local idlers, bribed by the promise of a slice of melon or\r\nbread-and-butter, go morning and evening to the grass-plots in the\r\nneighbourhood and fill their game-bags—cases made of reed-stumps—with\r\nlive Locusts and Grasshoppers. I on my side, net in hand, make a daily\r\ncircuit of my enclosure, in the hope of obtaining some choice morsel\r\nfor my boarders.\r\n\r\nThese tit-bits are intended to show me to what lengths the Mantis’\r\nstrength and daring can go. They include the big Grey Locust\r\n(Pachytylus cinerescens, Fab.), who is larger than the insect that will\r\nconsume him; the White-faced Decticus, armed with a vigorous pair of\r\nmandibles whereof our fingers would do well to fight shy; the quaint\r\nTryxalis, who wears a pyramid-shaped mitre on her head; the Vine\r\nEphippiger, [29] who clashes cymbals and sports a sword at the bottom\r\nof her pot-belly. To this assortment of game that is not any too easy\r\nto tackle, let us add two monsters, two of the largest Spiders of the\r\ndistrict: the Silky Epeira, whose flat, festooned abdomen is the size\r\nof a franc piece; and the Cross Spider, or Diadem Epeira, [30] who is\r\nhideously hairy and obese.\r\n\r\nI cannot doubt that the Mantis attacks such adversaries in the open,\r\nwhen I see her, under my covers, boldly giving battle to whatever comes\r\nin sight. Lying in wait among the bushes, she must profit by the fat\r\nprizes offered by chance even as, in the wire cage, she profits by the\r\ntreasures due to my generosity. Those big hunts, full of danger, are no\r\nnew thing; they form part of her normal existence. Nevertheless they\r\nappear to be rare, for want of opportunity, perhaps to the Mantis’ deep\r\nregret.\r\n\r\nLocusts of all kinds, Butterflies, Dragon-flies, large Flies, Bees and\r\nother moderate-sized captures are what we usually find in the lethal\r\nlimbs. Still the fact remains that, in my cages, the daring huntress\r\nrecoils before nothing. Sooner or later, Grey Locust and Decticus,\r\nEpeira and Tryxalis are harpooned, held tight between the saws and\r\ncrunched with gusto. The facts are worth describing.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the Grey Locust who has heedlessly approached along the\r\ntrelliswork of the cover, the Mantis gives a convulsive shiver and\r\nsuddenly adopts a terrifying posture. An electric shock would not\r\nproduce a more rapid effect. The transition is so abrupt, the attitude\r\nso threatening that the observer beholding it for the first time at\r\nonce hesitates and draws back his fingers, apprehensive of some unknown\r\ndanger. Old hand as I am, I cannot even now help being startled, should\r\nI happen to be thinking of something else.\r\n\r\nYou see before you, most unexpectedly, a sort of bogey-man or\r\nJack-in-the-box. The wing-covers open and are turned back on either\r\nside, slantingly; the wings spread to their full extent and stand erect\r\nlike parallel sails or like a huge heraldic crest towering over the\r\nback; the tip of the abdomen curls upwards like a crosier, rises and\r\nfalls, relaxing with short jerks and a sort of sough, a “Whoof! Whoof!”\r\nlike that of a Turkey-cock spreading his tail. It reminds one of the\r\npuffing of a startled Adder.\r\n\r\nPlanted defiantly on its four hind-legs, the insect holds its long bust\r\nalmost upright. The murderous legs, originally folded and pressed\r\ntogether upon the chest, open wide, forming a cross with the body and\r\nrevealing the arm-pits decorated with rows of beads and a black spot\r\nwith a white dot in the centre. These two faint imitations of the eyes\r\nin a Peacock’s tail, together with the dainty ivory beads, are warlike\r\nornaments kept hidden at ordinary times. They are taken from the\r\njewel-case only at the moment when we have to make ourselves brave and\r\nterrible for battle.\r\n\r\nMotionless in her strange posture, the Mantis watches the Locust, with\r\nher eyes fixed in his direction and her head turning as on a pivot\r\nwhenever the other changes his place. The object of this attitudinizing\r\nis evident: the Mantis wants to strike terror into her dangerous\r\nquarry, to paralyze it with fright, for, unless demoralized by fear, it\r\nwould prove too formidable.\r\n\r\nDoes she succeed in this? Under the shiny head of the Decticus, behind\r\nthe long face of the Locust, who can tell what passes? No sign of\r\nexcitement betrays itself to our eyes on those impassive masks.\r\nNevertheless it is certain that the threatened one is aware of the\r\ndanger. He sees standing before him a spectre, with uplifted claws,\r\nready to fall upon him; he feels that he is face to face with death;\r\nand he fails to escape while there is yet time. He who excels in\r\nleaping and could so easily hop out of reach of those talons, he, the\r\nbig-thighed jumper, remains stupidly where he is, or even draws nearer\r\nwith a leisurely step.\r\n\r\nThey say that little birds, paralysed with terror before the open jaws\r\nof the Snake, spell-bound by the reptile’s gaze, lose their power of\r\nflight and allow themselves to be snapped up. The Locust often behaves\r\nin much the same way. See him within reach of the enchantress. The two\r\ngrapnels fall, the claws strike, the double saws close and clutch. In\r\nvain the poor wretch protests: he chews space with his mandibles and,\r\nkicking desperately, strikes nothing but the air. His fate is sealed.\r\nThe Mantis furls her wings, her battle-standard; she resumes her normal\r\nposture; and the meal begins.\r\n\r\nIn attacking the Tryxalis and the Ephippiger, less dangerous game than\r\nthe Grey Locust and the Decticus, the spectral attitude is less\r\nimposing and of shorter duration. Often the throw of the grapnels is\r\nsufficient. This is likewise so in the case of the Epeira, who is\r\ngrasped round the body with not a thought of her poison-fangs. With the\r\nsmaller Locusts, the usual fare in my cages as in the open fields, the\r\nMantis seldom employs her intimidation-methods and contents herself\r\nwith seizing the reckless one that passes within her reach.\r\n\r\nWhen the prey to be captured is able to offer serious resistance, the\r\nMantis has at her service a pose that terrorizes and fascinates her\r\nquarry and gives her claws a means of hitting with certainty. Her\r\nrat-traps close on a demoralized victim incapable of defence. She\r\nfrightens her victim into immobility by suddenly striking a spectral\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\nThe wings play a great part in this fantastic pose. They are very wide,\r\ngreen on the outer edge, colourless and transparent every elsewhere.\r\nThey are crossed lengthwise by numerous veins, which spread in the\r\nshape of a fan. Other veins, transversal and finer, intersect the first\r\nat right angles and with them form a multitude of meshes. In the\r\nspectral attitude, the wings are displayed and stand upright in two\r\nparallel planes that almost touch each other, like the wings of a\r\nButterfly at rest. Between them the curled tip of the abdomen moves\r\nwith sudden starts. The sort of breath which I have compared with the\r\npuffing of an Adder in a posture of defence comes from this rubbing of\r\nthe abdomen against the nerves of the wings. To imitate the strange\r\nsound, all that you need do is to pass your nail quickly over the upper\r\nsurface of an unfurled wing.\r\n\r\nWings are essential to the male, a slender pigmy who has to wander from\r\nthicket to thicket at mating-time. He has a well-developed pair, more\r\nthan sufficient for his flight, the greatest range of which hardly\r\namounts to four or five of our paces. The little fellow is exceedingly\r\nsober in his appetites. On rare occasions, in my cages, I catch him\r\neating a lean Locust, an insignificant, perfectly harmless creature.\r\nThis means that he knows nothing of the spectral attitude, which is of\r\nno use to an unambitious hunter of his kind.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the advantage of the wings to the female is not very\r\nobvious, for she is inordinately stout at the time when her eggs ripen.\r\nShe climbs, she runs; but, weighed down by her corpulence, she never\r\nflies. Then what is the object of wings, of wings, too, which are\r\nseldom matched for breadth?\r\n\r\nThe question becomes more significant if we consider the Grey Mantis\r\n(Ameles decolor), who is closely akin to the Praying Mantis. The male\r\nis winged and is even pretty quick at flying. The female, who drags a\r\ngreat belly full of eggs, reduces her wings to stumps and, like the\r\ncheese-makers of Auvergne and Savoy, wears a short-tailed jacket. For\r\none who is not meant to leave the dry grass and the stones, this\r\nabbreviated costume is more suitable than superfluous gauze furbelows.\r\nThe Grey Mantis is right to retain but a mere vestige of the cumbrous\r\nsails.\r\n\r\nIs the other wrong to keep her wings, to exaggerate them, even though\r\nshe never flies? Not at all. The Praying Mantis hunts big game.\r\nSometimes a formidable prey appears in her hiding-place. A direct\r\nattack might be fatal. The thing to do is first to intimidate the\r\nnew-comer, to conquer his resistance by terror. With this object she\r\nsuddenly unfurls her wings into a ghost’s winding-sheet. The huge sails\r\nincapable of flight are hunting-implements. This stratagem is not\r\nneeded by the little Grey Mantis, who captures feeble prey, such as\r\nGnats and new-born Locusts. The two huntresses, who have similar habits\r\nand, because of their stoutness, are neither of them able to fly, are\r\ndressed to suit the difficulties of the ambuscade. The first, an\r\nimpetuous amazon, puffs her wings into a threatening standard; the\r\nsecond, a modest fowler, reduces them to a pair of scanty coat-tails.\r\n\r\nIn a fit of hunger, after a fast of some days’ duration, the Praying\r\nMantis will gobble up a Grey Locust whole, except for the wings, which\r\nare too dry; and yet the victim of her voracity is as big as herself,\r\nor even bigger. Two hours are enough for consuming this monstrous head\r\nof game. An orgy of the sort is rare. I have witnessed it once or twice\r\nand have always wondered how the gluttonous creature found room for so\r\nmuch food and how it reversed in its favour the axiom that the cask\r\nmust be greater than its contents. I can but admire the lofty\r\nprivileges of a stomach through which matter merely passes, being at\r\nonce digested, dissolved and done away with.\r\n\r\nThe usual bill of fare in my cages consists of Locusts of greatly\r\nvaried species and sizes. It is interesting to watch the Mantis\r\nnibbling her Acridian, firmly held in the grip of her two murderous\r\nfore-legs. Notwithstanding the fine, pointed muzzle, which seems\r\nscarcely made for this gorging, the whole dish disappears, with the\r\nexception of the wings, of which only the slightly fleshy base is\r\nconsumed. The legs, the tough skin, everything goes down. Sometimes the\r\nMantis seizes one of the big hinder thighs by the knuckle-end, lifts it\r\nto her mouth, tastes it and crunches it with a little air of\r\nsatisfaction. The Locust’s fat and juicy thigh may well be a choice\r\nmorsel for her, even as a leg of mutton is for us.\r\n\r\nThe prey is first attacked in the neck. While one of the two lethal\r\nlegs holds the victim transfixed through the middle of the body, the\r\nother presses the head and makes the neck open upwards. The Mantis’\r\nmuzzle roots and nibbles at this weak point in the armour with some\r\npersistency. A large wound appears in the head. The Locust gradually\r\nceases kicking and becomes a lifeless corpse; and, from this moment,\r\nfreer in its movements, the carnivorous insect picks and chooses its\r\nmorsel.\r\n\r\nThis preliminary gnawing of the neck is too regular an occurrence to be\r\npurposeless. Let us indulge in a digression which will tell us more\r\nabout it. In June I often find on the lavender in the enclosure two\r\nsmall Crab Spiders (Thomisus onustus, Walck., [31] and T. rotundatus,\r\nWalck.). One is satin-white and has pink and green rings round her\r\nlegs; the other is inky-black and has an abdomen encircled with red\r\nwith a foliaceous central patch. They are pretty Spiders, both of them,\r\nand they walk sideways, after the manner of Crabs. They do not know how\r\nto weave a hunting-net; the little silk which they possess is reserved\r\nexclusively for the downy satchel containing the eggs. Their plan of\r\ncampaign therefore is to lie in ambush on the flowers and to fling\r\nthemselves unexpectedly on the quarry when it arrives on pilfering\r\nintent.\r\n\r\nTheir favourite prey is the Hive-bee. I often come upon them with their\r\nprize, at times grabbed by the neck and at others by any part of the\r\nbody, even the tip of a wing. In each and every case the Bee is dead,\r\nwith her legs hanging limply and her tongue out.\r\n\r\nThe poison-fangs planted in the neck set me thinking; I see in them a\r\ncharacteristic remarkably like the practice of the Mantis when starting\r\non her Locust. And then arises another question: how does the weak\r\nSpider, who is vulnerable in every part of her soft body, manage to get\r\nhold of a prey like the Bee, stronger than herself, quicker in movement\r\nand armed with a sting that can inflict a mortal wound?\r\n\r\nThe difference in physical strength and force of arms between assailant\r\nand assailed is so very great that a contest of this kind seems\r\nimpossible unless some netting intervene, some silken toils that can\r\nshackle and bind the formidable creature. The contrast would be no more\r\nintense were the Sheep to take it into her head to fly at the Wolf’s\r\nthroat. And yet the daring attack takes place and victory goes to the\r\nweaker, as is proved by the numbers of dead Bees whom I see sucked for\r\nhours by the Thomisi. The relative weakness must be made good by some\r\nspecial art; the Spider must possess a strategy that enables her to\r\nsurmount the apparently insurmountable difficulty.\r\n\r\nTo watch events on the lavender-borders would expose me to long,\r\nfruitless waits. It is better myself to make the preparations for the\r\nduel. I place a Thomisus under a cover with a bunch of lavender\r\nsprinkled with a few drops of honey. Some three or four live Bees\r\ncomplete the establishment.\r\n\r\nThe Bees pay no heed to their redoubtable neighbour. They flutter\r\naround the trellised enclosure; from time to time they go and take a\r\nsip from the honeyed flowers, sometimes quite close to the Spider, not\r\na quarter of an inch away. They seem utterly unaware of their danger.\r\nThe experience of centuries has taught them nothing about the terrible\r\ncut-throat. The Thomisus, on her side, waits motionless on a spike of\r\nlavender, near the honey. Her four front legs, which are longer than\r\nthe others, are spread out and slightly raised, in readiness for\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nA Bee comes to drink at the drop of honey. This is the moment. The\r\nSpider springs forward and with her fangs seizes the imprudent one by\r\nthe tip of the wings, while her legs hold the victim in a tight\r\nembrace. A few seconds pass, during which the Bee struggles as best she\r\ncan against the aggressor on her back, out of the reach of her dagger.\r\nThis fight at close quarters cannot last long; the Bee would release\r\nherself from the other’s grip. And so the Spider lets go the wing and\r\nsuddenly bites her prey in the back of the neck. Once the fangs drive\r\nhome, it is all over: death ensues. The Bee is slain. Of her turbulent\r\nactivity naught lingers but some faint quivers of the tarsi, final\r\nconvulsions which are soon at an end.\r\n\r\nStill holding her prey by the nape of the neck, the Thomisus feasts not\r\non the body, which remains intact, but on the blood, which is slowly\r\nsucked. When the neck is drained dry, another spot is attacked, on the\r\nabdomen, the thorax, anywhere. This explains why my observations in the\r\nopen air showed me the Thomisus with her fangs fixed now in the neck,\r\nnow in some other part of the Bee. In the first case, the capture was a\r\nrecent one and the murderess still retained her original posture; in\r\nthe second case, it had been made some time before; and the Spider had\r\nforsaken the wound in the head, now sucked dry, to bite into some other\r\njuicy part, no matter which.\r\n\r\nThus shifting her fangs, a trifle this way or that, as she drains her\r\nprey, the little ogress gorges on her victim’s blood with voluptuous\r\ndeliberation. I have seen the meal last for seven consecutive hours;\r\nand even then the prey was let go only because of the shock given to\r\nits devourer by my indiscreet examination. The abandoned corpse, a\r\ncarcass of no value to the Spider, is not dismembered in any way. There\r\nis not a trace of bitten flesh, not a wound that shows. The Bee is\r\ndrained of her blood; and that is all.\r\n\r\nMy friend Bull, when he was alive, used to catch an enemy whose teeth\r\nthreatened danger by the skin of the neck. His method is in general use\r\nthroughout the canine race. There, in front of you, is a growling pair\r\nof jaws, open, white with foam, ready to bite. The most elementary\r\nprudence advises you to keep them quiet by catching hold of the back of\r\nthe neck.\r\n\r\nIn her fight with the Bee, the Spider has not the same object. What has\r\nshe to fear from her victim? The sting before all things, the terrible\r\ndart whose least stab would destroy her. And yet she does not trouble\r\nabout it. What she makes for is the back of the neck, that alone and\r\nnever anything else, so long as the prey remains alive. In so doing she\r\ndoes not aim at copying the tactics of the Dog and depriving the head,\r\nwhich is not particularly dangerous, of its power of movement. Her plan\r\nis farther-reaching and is revealed to us by the lightning death of the\r\nBee. The neck is no sooner gripped than the victim expires. The\r\ncerebral centres therefore are injured, poisoned with a deadly virus;\r\nand life is straightway extinguished at its very seat. This avoids a\r\nstruggle which, if prolonged, would certainly end in the aggressor’s\r\ndiscomfiture. The Bee has her strength and her sting on her side; the\r\ndelicate Thomisus has on hers a profound knowledge of the art of\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the Mantis, who likewise has mastered the first\r\nprinciples of speedy and scientific killing, in which the little\r\nBee-slaughtering Spider excels. A sturdy Locust is captured; sometimes\r\na powerful Grasshopper. The Mantis naturally wants to devour the\r\nvictuals in peace, without being troubled by the plunges of a victim\r\nwho absolutely refuses to be devoured. A meal liable to interruptions\r\nlacks savour. Now the principal means of defence in this case are the\r\nhind-legs, those vigorous levers which can kick out so brutally and\r\nwhich moreover are armed with toothed saws that would rip open the\r\nMantis’ bulky paunch if by ill-luck they happen to graze it. What shall\r\nwe do to reduce them to helplessness, together with the others, which\r\nare not dangerous but troublesome all the same, with their desperate\r\ngesticulations?\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, it would be practicable to cut them off one by one.\r\nBut that is a long process and attended with a certain risk. The Mantis\r\nhas hit upon something better. She has an intimate knowledge of the\r\nanatomy of the spine. By first attacking her prize at the back of the\r\nhalf-opened neck and munching the cervical ganglia, she destroys the\r\nmuscular energy at its main seat; and inertia supervenes, not suddenly\r\nand completely, for the clumsily-constructed Locust has not the Bee’s\r\nexquisite and frail vitality, but still sufficiently, after the first\r\nmouthfuls. Soon the kicking and the gesticulating die down, all\r\nmovement ceases and the game, however big it be, is consumed in perfect\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\nAmong the hunters, I have before now drawn a distinction between those\r\nwho paralyse and those who kill. [32] Both terrify one with their\r\nanatomical knowledge. To-day let us add to the killers the Thomisus,\r\nthat expert in stabbing in the neck, and the Mantis, who, to devour a\r\npowerful prey at her ease, deprives it of movement by first gnawing its\r\ncervical ganglia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE MANTIS: HER LOVE-MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little that we have seen of the Mantis’ habits hardly tallies with\r\nwhat we might have expected from her popular name. To judge by the term\r\nPrègo-Diéu, we should look to see a placid insect, deep in pious\r\ncontemplation; and we find ourselves in the presence of a cannibal, of\r\na ferocious spectre munching the brain of a panic-stricken victim. Nor\r\nis even this the most tragic part. The Mantis has in store for us, in\r\nher relations with her own kith and kin, manners even more atrocious\r\nthan those prevailing among the Spiders, who have an evil reputation in\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the number of cages on my big table and give myself a little\r\nmore space while still retaining a fair-sized menagerie, I instal\r\nseveral females, sometimes as many as a dozen, under one cover. So far\r\nas accommodation is concerned, no fault can be found with the common\r\nlodging. There is room and to spare for the evolutions of my captives,\r\nwho naturally do not want to move about much with their unwieldy\r\nbellies. Hanging to the trelliswork of the dome, motionless they digest\r\ntheir food or else await an unwary passer-by. Even so do they act when\r\nat liberty in the thickets.\r\n\r\nCohabitation has its dangers. I know that even Donkeys, those\r\npeace-loving animals, quarrel when hay is scarce in the manger. My\r\nboarders, who are less complaisant, might well, in a moment of dearth,\r\nbecome sour-tempered and fight among themselves. I guard against this\r\nby keeping the cages well supplied with Locusts, renewed twice a day.\r\nShould civil war break out, famine cannot be pleaded as the excuse.\r\n\r\nAt first, things go pretty well. The community lives in peace, each\r\nMantis grabbing and eating whatever comes near her, without seeking\r\nstrife with her neighbours. But this harmonious period does not last\r\nlong. The bellies swell, the eggs are ripening in the ovaries, marriage\r\nand laying-time are at hand. Then a sort of jealous fury bursts out,\r\nthough there is an entire absence of males who might be held\r\nresponsible for feminine rivalry. The working of the ovaries seems to\r\npervert the flock, inspiring its members with a mania for devouring one\r\nanother. There are threats, personal encounters, cannibal feasts. Once\r\nmore the spectral pose appears, the hissing of the wings, the fearsome\r\ngesture of the grapnels outstretched and uplifted in the air. No\r\nhostile demonstration in front of a Grey Locust or White-faced Decticus\r\ncould be more menacing.\r\n\r\nFor no reason that I can gather, two neighbours suddenly assume their\r\nattitude of war. They turn their heads to right and left, provoking\r\neach other, exchanging insulting glances. The “Puff! Puff!” of the\r\nwings rubbed by the abdomen sounds the charge. When the duel is to be\r\nlimited to the first scratch received, without more serious\r\nconsequences, the lethal fore-arms, which are usually kept folded, open\r\nlike the leaves of a book and fall back sideways, encircling the long\r\nbust. It is a superb pose, but less terrible than that adopted in a\r\nfight to the death.\r\n\r\nThen one of the grapnels, with a sudden spring, shoots out to its full\r\nlength and strikes the rival; it is no less abruptly withdrawn and\r\nresumes the defensive. The adversary hits back. The fencing is rather\r\nlike that of two Cats boxing each other’s ears. At the first blood\r\ndrawn from her flabby paunch, or even before receiving the least wound,\r\none of the duellists confesses herself beaten and retires. The other\r\nfurls her battle-standard and goes off elsewhither to meditate the\r\ncapture of a Locust, keeping apparently calm, but ever ready to repeat\r\nthe quarrel.\r\n\r\nVery often, events take a more tragic turn. At such times, the full\r\nposture of the duels to the death is assumed. The murderous fore-arms\r\nare unfolded and raised in the air. Woe to the vanquished! The other\r\nseizes her in her vice and then and there proceeds to eat her,\r\nbeginning at the neck, of course. The loathsome feast takes place as\r\ncalmly as though it were a matter of crunching up a Grasshopper. The\r\ndiner enjoys her sister as she would a lawful dish; and those around do\r\nnot protest, being quite willing to do as much on the first occasion.\r\n\r\nOh, what savagery! Why, even Wolves are said not to eat one another.\r\nThe Mantis has no such scruples; she banquets off her fellows when\r\nthere is plenty of her favourite game, the Locust, around her. She\r\npractises the equivalent of cannibalism, that hideous peculiarity of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThese aberrations, these child-bed cravings can reach an even more\r\nrevolting stage. Let us watch the pairing and, to avoid the disorder of\r\na crowd, let us isolate the couples under different covers. Each pair\r\nshall have its own home, where none will come to disturb the wedding.\r\nAnd let us not forget the provisions, with which we will keep them well\r\nsupplied, so that there may be no excuse of hunger.\r\n\r\nIt is near the end of August. The male, that slender swain, thinks the\r\nmoment propitious. He makes eyes at his strapping companion; he turns\r\nhis head in her direction; he bends his neck and throws out his chest.\r\nHis little pointed face wears an almost impassioned expression.\r\nMotionless, in this posture, for a long time he contemplates the object\r\nof his desire. She does not stir, is as though indifferent. The lover,\r\nhowever, has caught a sign of acquiescence, a sign of which I do not\r\nknow the secret. He goes nearer; suddenly he spreads his wings, which\r\nquiver with a convulsive tremor. That is his declaration. He rushes,\r\nsmall as he is, upon the back of his corpulent companion, clings on as\r\nbest he can, steadies his hold. As a rule, the preliminaries last a\r\nlong time. At last, coupling takes place and is also long drawn out,\r\nlasting sometimes for five or six hours.\r\n\r\nNothing worthy of attention happens between the two motionless\r\npartners. They end by separating, but only to unite again in a more\r\nintimate fashion. If the poor fellow is loved by his lady as the\r\nvivifier of her ovaries, he is also loved as a piece of\r\nhighly-flavoured game. And, that same day, or at latest on the morrow,\r\nhe is seized by his spouse, who first gnaws his neck, in accordance\r\nwith precedent, and then eats him deliberately, by little mouthfuls,\r\nleaving only the wings. Here we have no longer a case of jealousy in\r\nthe harem, but simply a depraved appetite.\r\n\r\nI was curious to know what sort of reception a second male might expect\r\nfrom a recently fertilized female. The result of my enquiry was\r\nshocking. The Mantis, in many cases, is never sated with conjugal\r\nraptures and banquets. After a rest that varies in length, whether the\r\neggs be laid or not, a second male is accepted and then devoured like\r\nthe first. A third succeeds him, performs his function in life, is\r\neaten and disappears. A fourth undergoes a like fate. In the course of\r\ntwo weeks I thus see one and the same Mantis use up seven males. She\r\ntakes them all to her bosom and makes them all pay for the nuptial\r\necstasy with their lives.\r\n\r\nOrgies such as this are frequent, in varying degrees, though there are\r\nexceptions. On very hot days, highly charged with electricity, they are\r\nalmost the general rule. At such times the Mantes are in a very\r\nirritable mood. In the cages containing a large colony, the females\r\ndevour one another more than ever; in the cages containing separate\r\npairs, the males, after coupling, are more than ever treated as an\r\nordinary prey.\r\n\r\nI should like to be able to say, in mitigation of these conjugal\r\natrocities, that the Mantis does not behave like this in a state of\r\nliberty; that the male, after doing his duty, has time to get out of\r\nthe way, to make off, to escape from his terrible mistress, for in my\r\ncages he is given a respite, lasting sometimes until next day. What\r\nreally occurs in the thickets I do not know, chance, a poor resource,\r\nhaving never instructed me concerning the love-affairs of the Mantis\r\nwhen at large. I can only go by what happens in the cages, where the\r\ncaptives, enjoying plenty of sunshine and food and spacious quarters,\r\ndo not seem to suffer from homesickness in any way. What they do here\r\nthey must also do under normal conditions.\r\n\r\nWell, what happens there utterly refutes the idea that the males are\r\ngiven time to escape. I find, by themselves, a horrible couple engaged\r\nas follows. The male, absorbed in the performance of his vital\r\nfunctions, holds the female in a tight embrace. But the wretch has no\r\nhead; he has no neck; he has hardly a body. The other, with her muzzle\r\nturned over her shoulder continues very placidly to gnaw what remains\r\nof the gentle swain. And, all the time, that masculine stump, holding\r\non firmly, goes on with the business!\r\n\r\nLove is stronger than death, men say. Taken literally, the aphorism has\r\nnever received a more brilliant confirmation. A headless creature, an\r\ninsect amputated down to the middle of the chest, a very corpse\r\npersists in endeavouring to give life. It will not let go until the\r\nabdomen, the seat of the procreative organs, is attacked.\r\n\r\nEating the lover after consummation of marriage, making a meal of the\r\nexhausted dwarf, henceforth good for nothing, can be understood, to\r\nsome extent, in the insect world, which has no great scruples in\r\nmatters of sentiment; but gobbling him up during the act goes beyond\r\nthe wildest dreams of the most horrible imagination. I have seen it\r\ndone with my own eyes and have not yet recovered from my astonishment.\r\n\r\nWas this one able to escape and get out of the way, caught as he was in\r\nthe midst of his duty? Certainly not. Hence we must infer that the\r\nloves of the Mantis are tragic, quite as much as the Spider’s and\r\nperhaps even more so. I admit that the restricted space inside the\r\ncages favours the slaughter of the males; but the cause of these\r\nmassacres lies elsewhere.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is a relic of the palæozoic ages, when, in the carboniferous\r\nperiod, the insect came into being as the result of monstrous amours.\r\nThe Orthoptera, to whom the Mantes belong, are the first-born of the\r\nentomological world. Rough-hewn, incomplete in their transformation,\r\nthey roamed among the arborescent ferns and were already flourishing\r\nwhen none of the insects with delicate metamorphoses, Butterflies,\r\nMoths, Beetles, Flies and Bees, as yet existed. Manners were not gentle\r\nin those days of passion eager to destroy in order to produce; and the\r\nMantes, a faint memory of the ghosts of old, might well continue the\r\namorous methods of a bygone age.\r\n\r\nThe habit of eating the males is customary among other members of the\r\nMantis family. I am indeed prepared to admit that it is general. The\r\nlittle Grey Mantis, who looks so sweet and so peaceable in my cages,\r\nnever seeking a quarrel with her neighbours however crowded they may\r\nbe, bites into her male and feeds on him as fiercely as the Praying\r\nMantis herself. I wear myself out, scouring the country to procure the\r\nindispensable complement to my gynæceum. No sooner is my\r\npowerfully-winged and nimble prize introduced than, most often, he is\r\nclawed and eaten up by one of those who no longer need his aid. Once\r\nthe ovaries are satisfied, the Mantes of both species abhor the male,\r\nor rather look upon him as nothing better than a choice piece of\r\nvenison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE MANTIS: HER NEST\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us show the insect of the tragic amours under a more attractive\r\naspect. Its nest is a marvel. In scientific language it is called\r\nootheca, the egg-case. I shall not overwork this outlandish term. We do\r\nnot say, “the Chaffinch’s egg-case,” when we mean, “the Chaffinch’s\r\nnest:” why should I be obliged to talk about a case when I speak of the\r\nMantis? It may sound more learned; but that is not my business.\r\n\r\nThe nest of the Praying Mantis is found more or less everywhere in\r\nsunny places, on stones, wood, vine-stocks, twigs, dry grass and even\r\non products of human industry, such as bits of brick, strips of coarse\r\nlinen or the hard, shrivelled leather of an old boot. Any support\r\nserves, without distinction, so long as there is an uneven surface to\r\nwhich the bottom of the nest can be fixed, thus securing a solid\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nThe usual dimensions are four centimetres in length and two in width.\r\n[33] The colour is as golden as a grain of wheat. When set alight, the\r\nmaterial burns readily and exhales a faint smell of singed silk. The\r\nsubstance is in fact akin to silk; only, instead of being drawn into\r\nthread, it has curdled into a frothy mass. When the nest is fixed to a\r\nbranch, the base goes round the nearest twigs, envelops them and\r\nassumes a shape which varies in accordance with the support\r\nencountered; when it is fixed to a flat surface, the under side, which\r\nis always moulded on the support, is itself flat. The nest thereupon\r\ntakes the form of a semi-ellipsoid, more or less blunt at one end,\r\ntapering at the other and often ending in a short, curved tail.\r\n\r\nWhatever the support, the upper surface of the nest is systematically\r\nconvex. We can distinguish in it three well-marked longitudinal zones.\r\nThe middle one, which is narrower than the others, is composed of\r\nlittle plates or scales arranged in pairs and overlapping like the\r\ntiles of a roof. The edges of these plates are free, leaving two\r\nparallel rows of slits or fissures through which the young emerge at\r\nhatching-time. In a recently-abandoned nest, this middle zone is furry\r\nwith gossamer skins, discarded by the larvæ. These cast skins flutter\r\nat the least breath and soon vanish when exposed to rough weather. I\r\nwill call it the exit-zone, because it is only along this median belt\r\nthat the liberation of the young takes place, thanks to the outlets\r\ncontrived beforehand.\r\n\r\nIn every other part the cradle of the numerous family presents an\r\nimpenetrable wall. The two side zones, in fact, which occupy the\r\ngreater part of the semi-ellipsoid, have perfect continuity of surface.\r\nThe little Mantes, so feeble at the start, could never make their way\r\nout through so tough a substance. All that we see on it is a number of\r\nfine, transversal furrows, marking the various layers of which the mass\r\nof eggs consists.\r\n\r\nCut the nest across. It will now be perceived that the eggs, taken\r\ntogether, form an elongated kernel, very hard and firm and coated on\r\nthe sides with a thick, porous rind, like solidified foam. Above are\r\ncurved plates, set very closely and almost independent of one another;\r\ntheir edges end in the exit-zone, where they form a double row of\r\nsmall, imbricated scales.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are buried in a yellow matrix of horny appearance. They are\r\nplaced in layers, shaped like segments of a circle, with the ends\r\ncontaining the heads converging towards the exit-zone. This arrangement\r\ntells us how the deliverance is accomplished. The new-born larvæ will\r\nslip into the space left between two adjoining plates, a prolongation\r\nof the kernel, where they will find a narrow passage, difficult to go\r\nthrough, but just sufficient when we bear in mind the curious provision\r\nof which we shall speak presently; and by so doing they will reach the\r\nmiddle belt. Here, under the imbricated scales, two outlets open for\r\neach layer of eggs. Half of the larvæ undergoing their liberation will\r\nemerge through the right door, half through the left. And this is\r\nrepeated for each layer from end to end of the nest.\r\n\r\nTo sum up these structural details, which are rather difficult to grasp\r\nfor any one who has not the thing in front of him: lying along the axis\r\nof the nest and shaped like a date-stone is the cluster of eggs,\r\ngrouped in layers. A protecting rind, a sort of solidified foam,\r\nsurrounds this cluster, except at the top along the median line, where\r\nthe frothy rind is replaced by thin plates set side by side. The free\r\nends of these plates form the exit-zone outside; they are imbricated in\r\ntwo series of scales and leave a couple of outlets, narrow clefts, for\r\neach layer of eggs.\r\n\r\nThe most striking part of my researches was being present at the\r\nconstruction of the nest and seeing how the Mantis goes to work to\r\nproduce so complex a building. I managed it with some difficulty, for\r\nthe laying takes place without warning and nearly always at night.\r\nAfter much useless waiting, chance at last favoured me. On the 5th of\r\nSeptember, one of my boarders, who had been fertilized on the 29th of\r\nAugust, decided to lay her eggs before my eyes at about four o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\nBefore watching her labour, let us note one thing: all the nests that I\r\nhave obtained in the cages—and there are a good many of them—have as\r\ntheir support, with not a single exception, the wire gauze of the\r\ncovers. I had taken care to place at the Mantes’ disposal a few rough\r\nbits of stone, a few tufts of thyme, foundations very often used in the\r\nopen fields. My captives preferred the wire network, whose meshes\r\nfurnish a perfectly safe support as the soft material of the building\r\nbecomes encrusted in them.\r\n\r\nThe nests, under natural conditions, enjoy no shelter; they have to\r\nendure the inclemencies of winter, to withstand rain, wind, frost and\r\nsnow without coming loose. Therefore the mother always chooses an\r\nuneven support for the nest, so that the foundations can be wedged into\r\nit and a firm hold obtained. But, when circumstances permit, the better\r\nis preferred to the middling and the best to the better; and this must\r\nbe the reason why the trelliswork of the cages is invariably adopted.\r\n\r\nThe only Mantis that I have been allowed to observe while engaged in\r\nlaying does her work upside down, hanging from the top of the cage. My\r\npresence, my magnifying-glass, my investigations do not disturb her at\r\nall, so great is her absorption in her labour. I can raise the\r\ntrellised dome, tilt it, turn it over, spin it this way and that,\r\nwithout the insect’s suspending its task for a moment. I can take my\r\nforceps and lift the long wings to see what is happening underneath.\r\nThe Mantis takes no notice. Up to this point, all is well: the mother\r\ndoes not move and impassively endures all the indiscretions of which I\r\nam guilty as an observer. And yet things do not go quite as I could\r\nwish, for the operation is too rapid and is too difficult to follow.\r\n\r\nThe end of the abdomen is immersed the whole time in a sea of foam,\r\nwhich prevents us from grasping the details of the process with any\r\nclearness. This foam is greyish-white, a little sticky and almost like\r\nsoapsuds. When it first appears, it adheres slightly to a straw which I\r\ndip into it, but, two minutes afterwards, it is solidified and no\r\nlonger sticks to the straw. In a very short time, its consistency is\r\nthat which we find in an old nest.\r\n\r\nThe frothy mass consists mainly of air imprisoned in little bubbles.\r\nThis air, which gives the nest a volume much greater than that of the\r\nMantis’ belly, obviously does not come from the insect, though the foam\r\nappears at the entrance of the genital organs; it is taken from the\r\natmosphere. The Mantis, therefore, builds above all with air, which is\r\neminently suited to protect the nest against the weather. She\r\ndischarges a sticky substance, similar to the caterpillars’ silk-fluid;\r\nand with this composition, which amalgamates instantly with the outer\r\nair, she produces foam.\r\n\r\nShe whips her product just as we whip white of egg to make it rise and\r\nfroth. The tip of the abdomen, opening with a long cleft, forms two\r\nlateral ladles which meet and separate with a constant, rapid movement,\r\nbeating the sticky fluid and turning it into foam as it is discharged\r\noutside. In addition, between the two flapping ladles, we see the\r\ninternal organs rising and falling, appearing and disappearing, after\r\nthe manner of a piston-rod, without being able to distinguish their\r\nprecise action, drowned as they are in the opaque stream of foam.\r\n\r\nThe end of the abdomen, ever throbbing, quickly opening and closing its\r\nvalves, swings from right to left and left to right like a pendulum.\r\nThe result of each swing is a layer of eggs inside and a transversal\r\nfurrow outside. As the abdomen advances in the arc described, suddenly\r\nand at very close intervals it dips deeper into the foam, as though it\r\nwere pushing something to the bottom of the frothy mass. Each time, no\r\ndoubt, an egg is laid; but things happen so fast and under conditions\r\nso unfavourable to observation that I never once succeed in seeing the\r\novipositor at work. I can judge of the arrival of the eggs only by the\r\nmovements of the tip of the abdomen, which suddenly drives down and\r\nimmerses itself more deeply.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the viscous stuff is poured forth in intermittent\r\nwaves and whipped and turned into foam by the two terminal valves. The\r\nfroth obtained spreads over the sides of the layer of eggs and at the\r\nbase, where I see it, pressed back by the abdomen, projecting through\r\nthe meshes of the gauze. Thus the spongy covering is gradually brought\r\ninto being as the ovaries are emptied.\r\n\r\nI imagine, without being able to rely on direct observation, that for\r\nthe central kernel, where the eggs are contained in a more homogeneous\r\nmaterial than the rind, the Mantis employs her product as it is,\r\nwithout beating it up and making it foam. When the eggs are deposited,\r\nthe two valves would produce foam to cover them. Once again, however,\r\nall this is very difficult to follow under the veil of the bubbling\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nIn a new nest, the exit-zone is coated with a layer of fine porous\r\nmatter, of a pure, dull, almost chalky white, which contrasts with the\r\ndirty white of the remainder of the nest. It is like the composition\r\nwhich confectioners make out of whipped white of egg, sugar and starch,\r\nwith which to ornament their cakes. This snowy covering is very easily\r\ncrumbled and removed. When it is gone, the exit-zone is clearly\r\ndefined, with its two rows of plates with free edges. The weather, the\r\nwind and the rain sooner or later remove it in strips and flakes; and\r\ntherefore the old nests retain no traces of it.\r\n\r\nAt the first inspection, one might be tempted to look upon this snowy\r\nmatter as a different substance from the remainder of the nest. But can\r\nit be that the Mantis really employs two different products? By no\r\nmeans. Anatomy, to begin with, assures us of the unity of the\r\nmaterials. The organ that secretes the substance of the nest consists\r\nof twisted cylindrical tubes, divided into two sections of twenty each.\r\nAll are filled with a colourless, viscous fluid, exactly similar in\r\nappearance wherever we look. There is nowhere any sign of a product\r\nwith a chalky colouring.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the snowy ribbon is formed also makes us reject the\r\ntheory of different materials. We see the Mantis’ two caudal threads\r\nsweeping the surface of the foamy mass, skimming, so to speak, the top\r\nof the froth, collecting it and retaining it along the back of the nest\r\nto form a band that looks like a ribbon of icing. What remains after\r\nthis sweeping, or what trickles from the band before it sets, spreads\r\nover the sides in a thin wash of bubbles so fine that they cannot be\r\nseen without the magnifying-glass.\r\n\r\nThe surface of a muddy stream containing clay will be covered with\r\ncoarse and dirty foam, churned up by the rushing torrent. On this foam,\r\nsoiled with earthy materials, we see here and there masses of beautiful\r\nwhite froth, with smaller bubbles. Selection is due to the difference\r\nin density; and so the snow-white foam in places lies on top of the\r\ndirty foam whence it proceeds. Something similar happens when the\r\nMantis builds her nest. The twin ladles reduce to foam the sticky spray\r\nfrom the glands. The thinnest and lightest portion, made whiter by its\r\nmore delicate porousness, rises to the surface, where the caudal\r\nthreads sweep it up and gather it into a snowy ribbon along the back of\r\nthe nest.\r\n\r\nUntil now, with a little patience, observation has been practicable and\r\nhas given satisfactory results. It becomes impossible when we come to\r\nthe very complex structure of that middle zone where exits are\r\ncontrived for the emergence of the larvæ under the shelter of a double\r\nrow of imbricated plates. The little that I am able to make out amounts\r\nto this: the tip of the abdomen, split wide from top to bottom, forms a\r\nsort of button-hole whose upper end remains almost fixed while the\r\nlower end, in swinging, produces foam and immerses eggs in it. It is\r\nthat upper end which is undoubtedly responsible for the work of the\r\nmiddle zone. I always see it in the extension of that zone, in the\r\nmidst of the fine white foam collected by the caudal filaments. These,\r\none on the right, the other on the left, mark the boundaries of the\r\nband. They feel its edges; they seem to be testing the work. I can\r\neasily imagine them two long and exquisitely delicate fingers\r\ncontrolling the difficult business of construction.\r\n\r\nBut how are the two rows of scales obtained and the fissures, the\r\nexit-doors, which they shelter? I do not know. I cannot even guess. I\r\nleave the rest of the problem to others.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful mechanism is this which emits so methodically and\r\nswiftly the horny matrix of the central kernel, the protecting froth,\r\nthe white foam of the median ribbon, the eggs and the fertilizing fluid\r\nand which at the same time is able to build overlapping plates,\r\nimbricated scales and alternating open fissures! We are lost in\r\nadmiration. And yet how easily the work is done! The Mantis hangs\r\nmotionless on the wire gauze which is the foundation of her nest. She\r\ngives not a glance at the edifice that is rising behind her; her legs\r\nare not called upon for assistance of any kind. The thing works of\r\nitself. We have here not an industrial task requiring the cunning of\r\ninstinct; it is a purely automatic process, regulated by the insect’s\r\ntools and organization. The nest, with its highly complicated\r\nstructure, proceeds solely from the play of the organs, even as in our\r\nown industries we manufacture by machinery a host of objects whose\r\nperfection would outwit our manual dexterity.\r\n\r\nFrom another point of view, the Mantis’ nest is more remarkable still.\r\nWe see in it a superb application of one of the most beautiful\r\nprinciples of physics, that of the conservation of heat. The Mantis\r\nanticipated us in a knowledge of non-conducting bodies.\r\n\r\nWe owe to Rumford, [34] the natural philosopher, the following curious\r\nexperiment, which fittingly demonstrates the low conductivity of the\r\nair. The illustrious scientist dropped a frozen cheese into a mass of\r\nfoam supplied by well-beaten eggs. The whole was subjected to the heat\r\nof an oven. The result in a short time was an omelette soufflée hot\r\nenough to burn the tongue, with the cheese in the middle as cold as at\r\nthe beginning. The air contained in the bubbles of the surrounding\r\nfroth explains the strange phenomenon. As an exceedingly poor thermal\r\nconductor, it had arrested the heat of the oven and prevented it from\r\nreaching the frozen substance in the centre.\r\n\r\nNow what does the Mantis do? Precisely the same as Rumford: she whips\r\nher white of egg into an omelette soufflée, to protect the eggs\r\ncollected into a central kernel. Her aim, it is true, is reversed: her\r\ncoagulated foam is intended to ward off the cold, not the heat. But a\r\nprotection against one is a protection against the other; and the\r\ningenious physicist, had he wished, could easily with the same frothy\r\nwrapper have maintained the heat of a body in cold surroundings.\r\n\r\nRumford knew the secrets of the stratum of air thanks to the\r\naccumulated knowledge of his ancestors, his own researches and his own\r\nstudies. How is it that for no one knows how many centuries the Mantis\r\nhas beaten our natural philosophers in the matter of this delicate\r\nproblem of heat? How did she come to think of wrapping a blanket of\r\nfoam around her mass of eggs, which, fixed without any shelter to a\r\ntwig or stone, has to endure the rigours of winter with impunity?\r\n\r\nThe other Mantidæ of my neighbourhood, the only ones of whom I can\r\nspeak with full knowledge, use the non-conducting wrapper of solidified\r\nfoam or do without it, according as the eggs are destined to live\r\nthrough the winter or not. The little Grey Mantis, who differs so\r\ngreatly from the other owing to the almost entire absence of wings in\r\nthe female, builds a nest not quite so big as a cherry-stone and covers\r\nit very cleverly with a rind of froth. Why this beaten-up envelope?\r\nBecause the nest of the Grey Mantis, like that of the Praying Mantis,\r\nhas to last through the winter, exposed on its bough or stone to all\r\nthe dangers of the bad weather.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in spite of her size, which is equal to that of the\r\nPraying Mantis, Empusa pauperata, who is the most curious of our\r\ninsects, builds a nest as small as that of the Grey Mantis. It is a\r\nvery modest edifice, consisting of a small number of cells set side by\r\nside in three or four rows joined together. Here there is no frothy\r\nenvelope at all, though the nest, like those mentioned above, is fixed\r\nin an exposed situation on some twig or broken stone. This absence of a\r\nnon-conducting mattress points to a difference in climatic conditions.\r\nThe Empusa’s eggs, in fact, hatch soon after they are laid, during the\r\nfine weather. Not having to undergo the inclemencies of winter, they\r\nhave no protection but the slender sheath of their cases.\r\n\r\nAre these scrupulous and rational precautions, which rival Rumford’s\r\nomelette soufflée, a casual result, one of those numberless\r\ncombinations turned out by the wheel of fortune? If so, let us not\r\nshrink from any absurdity, but recognize straightway that the blindness\r\nof chance is endowed with marvellous foresight.\r\n\r\nThe blunt end of the nest is the first part built by the Praying Mantis\r\nand the tapering end the last. The latter is often prolonged into a\r\nsort of spur made by drawing out the final drop of albuminous fluid\r\nused. To complete the whole thing demands about two hours of\r\nconcentrated work, free from interruption.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the laying is finished, the mother withdraws, callously. I\r\nexpected to see her return and display some tender feeling for the\r\ncradle of her family. But there is not the least sign of maternal joy.\r\nThe work is done and possesses no further interest for her. Some\r\nLocusts have come up. One even perches on the nest. The Mantis pays no\r\nattention to the intruders. They are peaceful, it is true. Would she\r\ndrive them away if they were dangerous and if they looked like ripping\r\nopen the egg-casket? Her impassive behaviour answers no. What is the\r\nnest to her henceforth? She knows it no more.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the repeated coupling of the Praying Mantis and of the\r\ntragic end of the male, who is nearly always devoured like an ordinary\r\npiece of game. In the space of a fortnight I have seen the same female\r\nmarry again as many as seven times over. Each time the easily-consoled\r\nwidow ate up her mate. Such habits make one assume repeated layings;\r\nand these do, in fact, take place, though they are not the general\r\nrule. Among my mothers, some gave me only one nest; others supplied me\r\nwith two, both equally large. The most fertile produced three, of which\r\nthe first two were of normal size, while the third was reduced to half\r\nthe usual dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe last-mentioned insect shall tell us the population which the\r\nMantis’ ovaries are capable of producing. Reckoning by the transversal\r\nfurrows of the nest, we can easily count the layers of eggs. These are\r\nmore or less rich according to their position at the middle of the\r\nellipsoid or at the ends. The numbers of the eggs in the biggest and in\r\nthe smallest layer furnish an average from which we can approximately\r\ndeduce the total. In this way I find that a good-sized nest contains\r\nabout four hundred eggs. The mother with the three nests, the last of\r\nwhich was only half the size of the others, therefore left as her\r\noffspring no fewer than a thousand germs; those who laid twice left\r\neight hundred; and the less fertile mothers three to four hundred. In\r\nevery case, it is a fine family, which would even become cumbrous, if\r\nit were not subjected to drastic pruning.\r\n\r\nThe pretty little Grey Mantis is much less lavish. In my cages she lays\r\nonly once; and her nest contains some sixty eggs at most. Although\r\nbuilt on the same principles and likewise fixed in the open, it differs\r\nremarkably from the work of the Praying Mantis, first in its scanty\r\ndimensions and next in certain details of structure. It is shaped like\r\na shelving ridge. The two sides are curved and the median line projects\r\ninto a slightly denticulated crest. It is grooved crosswise by about a\r\ndozen furrows, corresponding with the several layers of eggs. Here we\r\nfind no exit-zone, with short, imbricated scales; no snowy ribbon with\r\nalternating outlets. The whole surface, including the foundation, is\r\nuniformly covered with a shiny red-brown rind, in which the bubbles are\r\nvery small. One end is ogival in shape; the other, the end where the\r\nnest finishes, is abruptly truncated and is prolonged above in a short\r\nspur. The whole forms a kernel surrounded by the foamy rind. Like the\r\nPraying Mantis, the Grey Mantis works at night, an unfortunate\r\ncircumstance for the observer.\r\n\r\nLarge in size, curious in build and moreover plainly visible on its\r\nstone or its bit of brushwood, the Praying Mantis’ nest could not fail\r\nto attract the attention of the Provençal peasant. It is, in fact, very\r\nwell-known in the country districts, where it bears the name of tigno;\r\nit even enjoys a great reputation. Yet nobody seems to be aware of its\r\norigin. It is always a matter for surprise to my rustic neighbours when\r\nI inform them that the famous tigno is the nest of the common\r\nPrègo-Diéu. Their ignorance might well be due to the Mantis’ habit of\r\nlaying her eggs at night. The insect has never been caught working at\r\nher nest in the mysterious darkness; and the link between the worker\r\nand the work is missing, though both are known to every one in the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nNo matter: the singular object exists; it attracts the eye, it\r\ncaptivates the attention. It must therefore be good for something, it\r\nmust possess virtues. Thus, throughout the ages, have the ingenuous\r\nargued, hoping to find in the unfamiliar an alleviation of their pains.\r\n\r\nBy general consent, the rural pharmacopœia,  in Provence, extols the\r\ntigno as the best remedy against chilblains. The way to employ it is\r\nexceedingly simple. You cut the thing in two, squeeze it and rub the\r\nafflicted part with the streaming juice. The remedy, they say, works\r\nlike a charm. Every one mad with the itching of blue and swollen\r\nfingers hastens to have recourse to the tigno, according to traditional\r\ncustom. Does he really obtain relief?\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the unanimous conviction, I venture to doubt it, after\r\nthe fruitless experiments tried upon myself and other members of my\r\nhousehold during the winter of 1895, when the long and severe frost\r\nproduced any amount of epidermic discomfort. Not one of us, when\r\nsmeared with the celebrated ointment, saw the chilblains on his fingers\r\ndecrease nor felt the irritation relieved in the slightest degree by\r\nthe albuminous varnish of the crushed tigno. It seems probable that\r\nothers are no more successful and that the popular reputation of the\r\nspecific nevertheless survives, probably because of a mere identity of\r\nname between the remedy and the disease: the Provençal for chilblain is\r\ntigno. Once that the nest of the Praying Mantis and the chilblain are\r\nknown by the same name, do not the virtues of the former become\r\nobvious? That is how reputations are created.\r\n\r\nIn my village and no doubt for some distance around, the tigno—I am now\r\nspeaking of the Mantis’ nest—is also highly praised as a wonderful cure\r\nfor toothache. As long as you have it on you, you need never fear that\r\ntrouble. Our housewives gather it under a favourable moon; they\r\npreserve it religiously in a corner of the press; they sew it into\r\ntheir pocket, lest they should lose it when taking out their\r\nhandkerchief; and neighbours borrow it when tortured by some molar.\r\n\r\n“Lend me your tigno: I am in agony,” says the sufferer with the swollen\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe other hastens to unstitch and to hand over the precious object:\r\n\r\n“Don’t lose it, whatever you do,” she impresses on her friend. “It’s\r\nthe only one I have; and this isn’t the right time of moon.”\r\n\r\nLet us not laugh at this eccentric toothache-nostrum: many remedies\r\nthat sprawl triumphantly over the back pages of the newspapers are no\r\nmore effective. Besides, this rural simplicity is surpassed by some old\r\nbooks in which slumbers the science of by-gone days. An English\r\nnaturalist of the sixteenth century, Thomas Moffett, the physician,\r\n[35] tells us that, if a child lose his way in the country, he will ask\r\nthe Mantis to put him on his road. The Mantis, adds the author, “will\r\nstretch out one of her feet and shew him the right way and seldome or\r\nnever misse.” These charming things are told with adorable simplicity:\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Tam divina censetur bestiola, ut puero interroganti de via,\r\n    extento digito rectam monstrat atque raro vel nunquam fallat.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere did the credulous scholar get this pretty story? Not in England,\r\nwhere the Mantis cannot live; not in Provence, where we find no trace\r\nof the boyish question. All said, I prefer the spiflicating virtues of\r\nthe tigno to the old naturalist’s imaginings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE MANTIS: HER HATCHING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the Praying Mantis usually hatch in bright sunshine, at\r\nabout ten o’clock on a mid-June morning. The median band or exit-zone\r\nis the only portion of the nest that affords an outlet to the\r\nyoungsters.\r\n\r\nFrom under each scale of that zone we see slowly appearing a blunt,\r\ntransparent protuberance, followed by two large black specks, which are\r\nthe eyes. Softly the new-born grub slips under the thin plate and\r\nhalf-releases itself. Is it the little Mantis in his larval form, so\r\nnearly allied to that of the adult? Not yet. It is a transition\r\norganism. The head is opalescent, blunt, swollen, with palpitations\r\ncaused by the flow of the blood. The rest is tinted reddish-yellow. It\r\nis quite easy to distinguish, under a general overall, the large black\r\neyes clouded by the veil that covers them, the mouth-parts flattened\r\nagainst the chest, the legs plastered to the body from front to back.\r\nAltogether, with the exception of the very obvious legs, the whole\r\nthing, with its big blunt head, its eyes, its delicate abdominal\r\nsegmentation and its boatlike shape, reminds us somewhat of the first\r\nstate of the Cicadæ on leaving the egg, a state which is pictured\r\nexactly by a tiny, finless fish.\r\n\r\nHere then is a second instance of an organization of very brief\r\nduration having as its function to bring into the light of day, through\r\nnarrow and difficult passes, a microscopic creature whose limbs, if\r\nfree, would, because of their length, be an insurmountable impediment.\r\nTo enable him to emerge from the exiguous tunnel of his twig, a tunnel\r\nbristling with woody fibres and blocked with shells already empty, the\r\nCicada is born swathed in bands and endowed with a boat shape, which is\r\neminently suited to slipping easily through an awkward passage. The\r\nyoung Mantis is exposed to similar difficulties. He has to emerge from\r\nthe depths of the nest through narrow, winding ways, in which\r\nfull-spread, slender limbs would not be able to find room. The high\r\nstilts, the murderous harpoons, the delicate antennæ, organs which will\r\nbe most useful presently, in the brushwood, would now hinder the\r\nemergence, would make it very laborious, impossible. The creature\r\ntherefore comes into existence swaddled and furthermore takes the shape\r\nof a boat.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Cicada and the Mantis opens up a new vein to us in the\r\ninexhaustible entomological mine. I extract from it a law which other\r\nand similar facts, picked up more or less everywhere, will certainly\r\nnot fail to confirm. The true larva is not always the direct product of\r\nthe egg. When the newborn grub is likely to experience special\r\ndifficulties in effecting its deliverance, an accessory organism, which\r\nI shall continue to call the primary larva, precedes the genuine larval\r\nstate and has as its function to bring to the light of day the tiny\r\ncreature which is incapable of releasing itself.\r\n\r\nTo go on with our story, the primary larvæ show themselves under the\r\nthin plates of the exit-zone. A vigorous flow of humours occurs in the\r\nhead, swelling it out and converting it into a diaphanous and\r\never-throbbing blister. In this way the splitting-apparatus is\r\nprepared. At the same time, the little creature, half-caught under its\r\nscale, sways, pushes forward, draws back. Each swaying is accompanied\r\nby an increase of the swelling in the head. At last the prothorax\r\narches and the head is bent low towards the chest. The tunic bursts\r\nacross the prothorax. The little animal tugs, wriggles, sways, bends\r\nand straightens itself again. The legs are drawn from their sheaths;\r\nthe antennæ, two long parallel threads, are likewise released. The\r\ncreature is now fastened to the nest only by a worn-out cord. A few\r\nshakes complete the deliverance.\r\n\r\nWe here have the insect in its genuine larval form. All that remains\r\nbehind is a sort of irregular cord, a shapeless clout which the least\r\nbreath blows about like a flimsy bit of fluff. It is the exit-tunic\r\nviolently shed and reduced to a mere rag.\r\n\r\nFor all my watchfulness, I missed the moment of hatching in the case of\r\nthe Grey Mantis. The little that I know is reduced to this: at the end\r\nof the spur or promontory with which the nest finishes in front is a\r\nsmall, dull-white speck, formed of very powdery foam. This round pore\r\nis only just plugged with a frothy stopper and constitutes the sole\r\noutlet from the nest, which is thoroughly strengthened at every other\r\npart. It takes the place of the long band of scales through which the\r\nPraying Mantis is released. It is here that the youngsters must emerge\r\none by one from their casket. Chance does not favour me and I do not\r\nwitness the exodus, but, soon after the family has come forth, I see\r\ndangling at the entrance to the liberating pore a shapeless bunch of\r\nwhite cast-off clothes, thin skins which a puff of wind would disperse.\r\nThese are the garments flung aside by the young as they make their\r\nappearance in the open air; and they testify to the presence of a\r\ntransition wrapper which permits of movement inside the maze of the\r\nnest. The Grey Mantis therefore also has her primary larva, which packs\r\nitself up in a narrow sheath, conducive to escape. The period of this\r\nemergence is June.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Praying Mantis. The hatching does not take place all\r\nover the nest at one time, but rather in sections, in successive swarms\r\nwhich may be separated by intervals of two days or more. The pointed\r\nend, containing the last eggs, usually begins. This inversion of\r\nchronological order, calling the last to the light of day before the\r\nfirst, may well be due to the shape of the nest. The thin end, which is\r\nmore accessible to the stimulus of a fine day, wakes up before the\r\nblunt end, which is larger and does not so soon acquire the necessary\r\namount of heat.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, although still broken up in swarms, the hatching\r\nembraces the whole length of the exit-zone. A striking sight indeed is\r\nthe sudden exodus of a hundred young Mantes. Hardly does the tiny\r\ncreature show its black eyes under a scale before others appear\r\ninstantly, in their numbers. It is as though a certain shock were being\r\ncommunicated from one to another, as though an awakening signal were\r\ntransmitted, so swiftly does the hatching spread all round. Almost in a\r\nmoment the median band is covered with young Mantes who run about\r\nfeverishly, stripping themselves of their rent garments.\r\n\r\nThe nimble little creatures do not stay long on the nest. They let\r\nthemselves drop off or else clamber into the nearest foliage. All is\r\nover in less than twenty minutes. The common cradle resumes its\r\npeaceful condition, prior to furnishing a new legion a few days later;\r\nand so on until all the eggs are finished.\r\n\r\nI have witnessed this exodus as often as I wished to, either out of\r\ndoors, in my enclosure, where I had deposited in sunny places the nests\r\ngathered more or less everywhere during my winter leisure, or else in\r\nthe seclusion of a greenhouse, where I thought, in my simplicity, that\r\nI should be better able to protect the budding family. I have witnessed\r\nthe hatching twenty times if I have once; and I have always beheld a\r\nscene of unforgetable carnage. The round-bellied Mantis may procreate\r\ngerms by the thousands: she will never have enough to cope with the\r\ndevourers who are destined to decimate the breed from the moment that\r\nit leaves the egg.\r\n\r\nThe Ants above all are zealous exterminators. Daily I surprise their\r\nill-omened visits on my rows of nests. It is vain for me to intervene,\r\nhowever seriously; their assiduity never slackens. They seldom succeed\r\nin making a breach in the fortress: that is too difficult; but, greedy\r\nof the dainty flesh in course of formation inside, they await a\r\nfavourable opportunity, they lie in wait for the exit.\r\n\r\nDespite my daily watchfulness, they are there the moment that the young\r\nMantes appear. They grab them by the abdomen, pull them out of their\r\nsheaths, cut them up. You see a piteous fray between tender babes\r\ngesticulating as their only means of defence and ferocious brigands\r\ncarrying their spolia opima at the end of their mandibles. In less than\r\nno time the massacre of the innocents is consummated; and all that\r\nremains of the flourishing family is a few scattered survivors who have\r\nescaped by accident.\r\n\r\nThe future assassin, the scourge of the insect race, the terror of the\r\nLocust on the brushwood, the dread devourer of fresh meat, is herself\r\ndevoured, from her birth, by one of the least of that race, the Ant.\r\nThe ogress, prolific to excess, sees her family thinned by the dwarf.\r\nBut the slaughter is not long continued. So soon as she has acquired a\r\nlittle firmness from the air and strengthened her legs, the Mantis\r\nceases to be attacked. She trots about briskly among the Ants, who fall\r\nback as she passes, no longer daring to tackle her. With her\r\ngrappling-legs brought close to her chest, like arms ready for\r\nself-defence, already she strikes awe into them by her proud bearing.\r\n\r\nA second connoisseur in tender meats pays no heed to these threats.\r\nThis is the little Grey Lizard, the lover of sunny walls. Apprised I\r\nknow not how of the quarry, here he comes, picking up one by one, with\r\nthe tip of his slender tongue, the stray insects that have escaped the\r\nAnts. They make a small mouthful but an exquisite one, so it seems, to\r\njudge by the blinking of the reptile’s eye. For each little wretch\r\ngulped down, its lid half-closes, a sign of profound satisfaction. I\r\ndrive away the bold Lizard who ventures to perpetrate his raid before\r\nmy eyes. He comes back again and, this time, pays dearly for his\r\nrashness. If I let him have his way, I should have nothing left.\r\n\r\nIs this all? Not yet. Another ravager, the smallest of all but not the\r\nleast formidable, has anticipated the Lizard and the Ant. This is a\r\nvery tiny Hymenopteron armed with a probe, a Chalcis, who establishes\r\nher eggs in the newly-built nest. The Mantis’ brood shares the fate of\r\nthe Cicada’s: parasitic vermin attack the eggs and empty the shells.\r\nOut of all that I have collected I often obtain nothing or hardly\r\nanything. The Chalcis has been that way.\r\n\r\nLet us gather up what the various exterminators, known or unknown, have\r\nleft me. When newly hatched, the larva is of a pale hue, white faintly\r\ntinged with yellow. The swelling of its head soon diminishes and\r\ndisappears. Its colour is not long in darkening and turns light-brown\r\nwithin twenty-four hours. The little Mantis very nimbly lifts up her\r\ngrappling-legs, opens and closes them; she turns her head to right and\r\nleft; she curls her abdomen. The fully-developed larva has no greater\r\nlitheness and agility. For a few minutes the family stops where it is,\r\nswarming over the nest; then it scatters at random on the ground and\r\nthe plants hard by.\r\n\r\nI instal a few dozen emigrants under bell-covers. On what shall I feed\r\nthese future huntresses? On game, obviously. But what game? To these\r\nminiature creatures I can only offer atoms. I serve them up a\r\nrose-branch covered with Green Fly. The plump Aphis, a tender morsel\r\nsuited to my feeble guests, is utterly scorned. Not one of the captives\r\ntouches it.\r\n\r\nI try them with Midges, the smallest that chance flings into my net as\r\nit sweeps the grass, and meet with the same obstinate refusal. I offer\r\nthem pieces of Fly, hung here and there on the gauze of the cover. None\r\naccepts my quarters of venison. Perhaps the Locust will tempt them, the\r\nLocust on whom the adult Mantis dotes? A prolonged and minute search\r\nplaces me in possession of what I want. This time the bill of fare will\r\nconsist of a few recently hatched Acridians. Young as they are, they\r\nhave already reached the size of my charges. Will the little Mantes\r\nfancy these? They do not fancy them: at the sight of their tiny prey\r\nthey run away dismayed.\r\n\r\nThen what do you want? What other game do you find on your native\r\nbrushwood? I can see nothing. Can you have some special infants’ food,\r\nvegetarian perhaps? Let us even try the improbable. The very tenderest\r\nbit of the heart of a lettuce is declined. So are the different sorts\r\nof grass which I tax my ingenuity in varying; so are the drops of honey\r\nwhich I place on spikes of lavender. All my endeavours come to nothing;\r\nand my captives die of inanition.\r\n\r\nMy failure has its lessons. It seems to point to a transition diet\r\nwhich I have not been able to discover. Long ago, the larvæ of the\r\nOil-beetles gave me a great deal of trouble, before I knew that they\r\nwant as their first food the egg of the Bee whose store of honey they\r\nwill afterwards consume. Perhaps the young Mantes also in the beginning\r\ndemand a special pap, something more in keeping with their frailty.\r\nDespite its resolute air, I do not quite see the feeble little creature\r\nhunting. The game, whatever it be, kicks out, when attacked, frisks\r\nabout, defends itself; and the assailant is not yet in a condition to\r\nward off even the flap of a Midge’s wing. Then what does it feed on? I\r\nshould not be surprised if there were interesting facts to be picked up\r\nin this baby-food question.\r\n\r\nThese fastidious ones, so difficult to provide with nourishment, meet\r\nwith even more pitiful deaths than hunger. When only just born, they\r\nfall a prey to the Ant, the Lizard and other ravagers who lie in wait,\r\npatiently, for the exquisite provender to hatch. The egg itself is not\r\nrespected. An infinitesimal perforator inserts her own eggs in the nest\r\nthrough the barrier of solidified foam, thus settling her offspring,\r\nwhich, maturing earlier, nips the Mantis’ family in the bud. How many\r\nare called and how few are chosen! There were a thousand of them\r\nperhaps, sprung from one mother who was capable of giving birth to\r\nthree broods. One couple alone escapes extermination, one alone keeps\r\nup the breed, seeing that the number remains more or less the same from\r\nyear to year.\r\n\r\nHere a serious question arises. Can the Mantis have acquired her\r\npresent fecundity by degrees? Can she, as the ravages of the Ant and\r\nothers reduced her progeny, have increased the output of her ovaries so\r\nas to make up for excessive destruction by excessive production? Could\r\nthe enormous brood of to-day be due to the wastage of former days? So\r\nthink some, who are ready, without convincing proofs, to see in animals\r\neven more profound changes brought about by circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn front of my window, on the sloping margin of the pond, stands a\r\nmagnificent cherry-tree. It came there by accident, a sturdy wilding,\r\ndisregarded by my predecessors and to-day respected far more for its\r\nspreading branches than for its fruit, which is of very indifferent\r\nquality. In April it forms a splendid white-satin dome. Its blossoms\r\nare as snow; their fallen petals carpet the ground. Soon the red\r\ncherries appear in profusion. O my beautiful tree, how lavish you are\r\nand what a number of baskets you will fill!\r\n\r\nAnd for this reason what revelry up above! The Sparrow is the first to\r\nhear of the ripe cherries and comes trooping, morning and evening, to\r\npilfer and squall; he informs his friends in the neighbourhood, the\r\nGreenfinch and the Warbler, who hasten up and banquet for weeks on end.\r\nButterflies flit from one nibbled cherry to another, taking delicious\r\nsips at each. Rose-chafers bite great mouthfuls out of the fruit, then\r\nfall asleep sated. Wasps and Hornets burst open the sweet caskets; and\r\nthe Gnats follow to get drunk in their wake. A plump maggot, settled in\r\nthe very centre of the pulp, blissfully feasts upon its juicy\r\ndwelling-house and waxes big and fat. It will rise from table to change\r\ninto a comely Fly.\r\n\r\nOn the ground there are others at the banquet. A host of footpads is\r\nbattening on the fallen cherries. At night, the Field-mice come\r\ngathering the stones stripped by the Wood-lice, Earwigs, Ants and\r\nSlugs; they hoard them in their burrows. During the long winter they\r\nwill make holes in them to extract and nibble the kernels. A numberless\r\nthrong lives upon the generous cherry-tree.\r\n\r\nWhat would the tree require to provide a successor one day and maintain\r\nits species in a state of harmonious and well-balanced prosperity? A\r\nsingle seed would be enough; and every year it gives forth bushels and\r\nbushels. Tell me why, please.\r\n\r\nShall we say that the cherry-tree, at first very economical with its\r\nfruit, became lavish by degrees in order thus to escape its\r\nmultitudinous ravagers? Shall we say of the tree, as we said of the\r\nMantis, that excessive destruction gradually induced excessive\r\nproduction? Who would dare to venture on such rash statements? Is it\r\nnot perfectly obvious that the cherry-tree is one of those factories in\r\nwhich elements are wrought into organic matter, one of those\r\nlaboratories in which the dead thing is changed into the thing fitted\r\nto live? No doubt, cherries ripen that they may be perpetuated; but\r\nthese are the minority, the very small minority. If all seeds were to\r\nsprout and to develop fully, there would long ago have been no room on\r\nthe earth for the cherry-tree alone. The vast majority of its fruits\r\nfulfil another function. They serve as food for a crowd of living\r\ncreatures, who are not skilled as the plant is in the transcendental\r\nchemistry that turns the uneatable into the eatable.\r\n\r\nMatter, in order to serve in the highest manifestations of life, must\r\nundergo slow and most delicate elaboration. That elaboration begins in\r\nthe workshop of the infinitely small, of the microbe, for instance, one\r\nof which, more powerful than the lightning’s might, combines oxygen and\r\nnitrogen and produces nitrates, the primary food of plants. It begins\r\non the confines of nothingness, is improved in the vegetal, is yet\r\nfurther refined in the animal and step by step attains the substance of\r\nthe brain.\r\n\r\nHow many hidden labourers, how many unknown manipulators worked perhaps\r\nfor centuries, first at getting the rough ore and then at the refining\r\nof that grey matter which becomes the brain, the most marvellous of the\r\nimplements of the mind, even if it were capable only of making us say:\r\n\r\n“Two and two are four!”\r\n\r\nThe rocket, when rising, reserves for the culminating point of its\r\nascent the dazzling fountain of its many-coloured lights. Then all is\r\ndark again. Its smoke, its gases, its oxides will, in the long run, be\r\nable to reconstitute other explosives by vegetable processes. Even so\r\ndoes matter act in its metamorphoses. From stage to stage, from one\r\ndelicate refinement to another yet more delicate, it succeeds in\r\nattaining heights where the splendours of the intellect shine forth\r\nthrough its agency; then, shattered by the effort, it relapses into the\r\nnameless thing whence it started, into scattered molecules which are\r\nthe common origin of living things.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the assemblers of organic matter stands the plant, the\r\nanimal’s senior. Directly or indirectly, it is to-day, as it was in the\r\ngeological period, the chief purveyor to beings more generously endowed\r\nwith life. In the laboratory of its cell the food of the universe at\r\nleast gets its first rough preparation. Comes the animal, which\r\ncorrects the preparation, improves it and transmits it to others of a\r\nhigher order. Cropped grass becomes mutton; and mutton becomes human\r\nflesh or Wolf-flesh, according to the consumer.\r\n\r\nAmong those elaborators of nourishing atoms which do not create organic\r\nmatter out of any- and everything, starting with the mineral, as the\r\nplant does, the most prolific are the fishes, the first-born of\r\nvertebrate animals. Ask the Cod what she does with her millions of\r\neggs. Her answer will be that of the beech with its myriads of nuts, or\r\nthe oak with its myriads of acorns. She is immensely fruitful in order\r\nto feed an immense number of the hungry. She is continuing the work\r\nwhich her predecessors performed in remote ages, when nature, not as\r\nyet rich in organic matter, hastened to increase her reserves of life\r\nby bestowing prodigious exuberance upon her primeval workers.\r\n\r\nThe Mantis, like the fish, dates back to those distant epochs. Her\r\nstrange shape and her uncouth habits have told us so. The richness of\r\nher ovaries confirms it. She retains in her entrails a feeble relic of\r\nthe procreative fury that prevailed in olden times under the dank shade\r\nof the arborescent ferns; she contributes, in a very humble but none\r\nthe less real measure, to the sublime alchemy of living things.\r\n\r\nLet us look closely at her work. The grass grows thick and green,\r\ndrawing its nourishment from the earth. The Locust crops it. The Mantis\r\nmakes a meal of the Locust and swells out with eggs, which are laid, in\r\nthree batches, to the number of a thousand. When they hatch, up comes\r\nthe Ant and levies an enormous tribute on the brood. We appear to be\r\nretroceding. In vastness of bulk, yes; in refinement of instinct,\r\ncertainly not. In this respect how far superior is the Ant to the\r\nMantis! Besides, the cycle of possible happenings is not closed.\r\n\r\nYoung Ants still contained in their cocoon—popularly known as\r\nAnts’-eggs—form the food on which the Pheasant’s brood is reared. These\r\nare domestic poultry just as much as the Pullet and the Capon, but\r\ntheir keep makes greater demands on the owner’s care and purse. When it\r\ngrows big, this poultry is let loose in the woods; and people calling\r\nthemselves civilized take the greatest pleasure in bringing down with\r\ntheir guns the poor creatures which have lost the instinct of\r\nself-preservation in the pheasantries, or, to speak plainly, in the\r\npoultry-yard. You cut the throat of the Chicken required for roasting;\r\nyou shoot, with all the parade of sport, that other Chicken, the\r\nPheasant. I fail to understand those insensate massacres.\r\n\r\nTartarin of Tarascon, in the absence of game, used to shoot at his cap.\r\nI prefer that. And above all I prefer the hunting, real hunting, of\r\nanother fervent consumer of Ants, the Wryneck, the Tiro-lengo of the\r\nProvençaux, so-called because of his scientific method of darting his\r\nimmensely-long and sticky tongue across a procession of Ants and then\r\nsuddenly withdrawing it all black with the limed insects. With such\r\nmouthfuls as these, the Wryneck becomes disgracefully fat in autumn; he\r\nplasters himself with butter on his rump and sides and under his wings;\r\nhe hangs a string of it round his neck; he pads his skull with it right\r\ndown to the beak.\r\n\r\nHe is then delicious, roasted: small, I admit; no bigger than a Lark,\r\nat the outside; but, small though he be, unlike anything else and\r\nimmeasurably superior to the Pheasant, who must begin to go bad before\r\ndeveloping a flavour at all.\r\n\r\nLet me for this once do justice to the merit of the humblest! When the\r\ntable is cleared after the evening meal and all is quiet and my body\r\nrelieved for the time being of its physiological needs, sometimes I\r\nsucceed in picking up, here and there, a good idea or two; and it may\r\nwell be that the Mantis, the Locust, the Ant and even lesser creatures\r\ncontribute to these sudden gleams of light which flash unaccountably\r\ninto one’s mind. By strange and devious paths, they have all supplied,\r\nin their respective ways, the drop of oil that feeds the lamp of\r\nthought. Their energies, slowly developed, stored up and handed down by\r\npredecessors, become infused into our veins and sustain our weakness.\r\nWe live by their death.\r\n\r\nTo conclude. The Mantis, prolific to excess, in her turn makes organic\r\nmatter, bequeathing it to the Ant, who bequeaths it to the Wryneck, who\r\nbequeaths it perhaps to man. She procreates a thousand, partly to\r\nperpetuate her species, but far more than she may contribute, according\r\nto her means, to the general picnic of the living. She brings us back\r\nto the ancient symbol of the Serpent biting its own tail. The world is\r\nan endless circle: everything finishes so that everything may begin\r\nagain; everything dies so that everything may live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE EMPUSA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea, life’s first foster-mother, still preserves in her depths many\r\nof those singular and incongruous shapes which were the earliest\r\nattempts of the animal kingdom; the land, less fruitful, but with more\r\ncapacity for progress, has almost wholly lost the strange forms of\r\nother days. The few that remain belong especially to the series of\r\nprimitive insects, insects exceedingly limited in their industrial\r\npowers and subject to very summary metamorphoses, if to any at all. In\r\nmy district, in the front rank of those entomological anomalies which\r\nremind us of the denizens of the old coal-forests, stand the Mantidæ,\r\nincluding the Praying Mantis, so curious in habits and structure. Here\r\nalso is the Empusa (E. pauperata, Latr.), the subject of this chapter.\r\n\r\nHer larva is certainly the strangest creature among the terrestrial\r\nfauna of Provence: a slim, swaying thing of so fantastic an appearance\r\nthat uninitiated fingers dare not lay hold of it. The children of my\r\nneighbourhood, impressed by its startling shape, call it “the\r\nDevilkin.” In their imaginations, the queer little creature savours of\r\nwitchcraft. One comes across it, though always sparsely, in spring, up\r\nto May; in autumn; and sometimes in winter, if the sun be strong. The\r\ntough grasses of the wastelands, the stunted bushes which catch the sun\r\nand are sheltered from the wind by a few heaps of stones are the chilly\r\nEmpusa’s favourite abode.\r\n\r\nLet us give a rapid sketch of her. The abdomen, which always curls up\r\nso as to join the back, spreads paddlewise and twists into a crook.\r\nPointed scales, a sort of foliaceous expansions arranged in three rows,\r\ncover the lower surface, which becomes the upper surface because of the\r\ncrook aforesaid. The scaly crook is propped on four long, thin stilts,\r\non four legs armed with knee-pieces, that is to say, carrying at the\r\nend of the thigh, where it joins the shin, a curved, projecting blade\r\nnot unlike that of a cleaver.\r\n\r\nAbove this base, this four-legged stool, rises, at a sudden angle, the\r\nstiff corselet, disproportionately long and almost perpendicular. The\r\nend of this bust, round and slender as a straw, carries the\r\nhunting-trap, the grappling limbs, copied from those of the Mantis.\r\nThey consist of a terminal harpoon, sharper than a needle, and a cruel\r\nvice, with jaws toothed like a saw. The jaw formed by the arm proper is\r\nhollowed into a groove and carries on either side five long spikes,\r\nwith smaller indentations in between. The jaw formed by the fore-arm is\r\nsimilarly furrowed, but its double saw, which fits into the groove of\r\nthe upper arm when at rest, is formed of finer, closer and more regular\r\nteeth. The magnifying-glass reveals a score of equal points in each\r\nrow. The machine only lacks size to be a fearful implement of torture.\r\n\r\nThe head is in keeping with this arsenal. What a queer-shaped head it\r\nis! A pointed face, with walrus moustaches furnished by the palpi;\r\nlarge goggle eyes; between them, a dirk, a halberd blade; and, on the\r\nforehead, a mad, unheard-of thing: a sort of tall mitre, an extravagant\r\nhead-dress that juts forward, spreading right and left into peaked\r\nwings and cleft along the top. What does the Devilkin want with that\r\nmonstrous pointed cap, than which no wise man of the East, no\r\nastrologer of old ever wore a more splendiferous? This we shall learn\r\nwhen we see her out hunting.\r\n\r\nThe dress is commonplace; grey tints predominate. Towards the end of\r\nthe larval period, after a few moultings, it begins to give a glimpse\r\nof the adult’s richer livery and becomes striped, still very faintly,\r\nwith pale-green, white and pink. Already the two sexes are\r\ndistinguished by their antennæ. Those of the future mothers are\r\nthread-like; those of the future males are distended into a spindle at\r\nthe lower half, forming a case or sheath whence graceful plumes will\r\nspring at a later date.\r\n\r\nBehold the creature, worthy of a Callot’s [36] fantastic pencil. If you\r\ncome across it in the bramble-bushes, it sways upon its four stilts, it\r\nwags its head, it looks at you with a knowing air, it twists its mitre\r\nround and peers over its shoulder. You seem to read mischief in its\r\npointed face. You try to take hold of it. The imposing attitude ceases\r\nforthwith, the raised corselet is lowered and the creature makes off\r\nwith mighty strides, helping itself along with its fighting-limbs,\r\nwhich clutch the twigs. The flight need not last long, if you have a\r\npractised eye. The Empusa is captured, put into a screw of paper, which\r\nwill save her frail limbs from sprains, and lastly penned in a\r\nwire-gauze cage. In this way, in October, I obtain a flock sufficient\r\nfor my purpose.\r\n\r\nHow to feed them? My Devilkins are very little; they are a month or two\r\nold at most. I give them Locusts suited to their size, the smallest\r\nthat I can find. They refuse them. Nay more, they are frightened of\r\nthem. Should a thoughtless Locust meekly approach one of the Empusæ,\r\nsuspended by her four hind-legs to the trellised dome, the intruder\r\nmeets with a bad reception. The pointed mitre is lowered; and an angry\r\nthrust sends him rolling. We have it: the wizard’s cap is a defensive\r\nweapon, a protective crest. The Ram charges with his forehead, the\r\nEmpusa butts with her mitre.\r\n\r\nBut this does not mean dinner. I serve up the House-fly, alive. She is\r\naccepted, without hesitation. The moment that the Fly comes within\r\nreach, the watchful Devilkin turns her head, bends the stalk of her\r\ncorselet slantwise and, flinging out her forelimb, harpoons the Fly and\r\ngrips her between her two saws. No Cat pouncing upon a Mouse could be\r\nquicker.\r\n\r\nThe game, however small, is enough for a meal. It is enough for the\r\nwhole day, often for several days. This is my first surprise: the\r\nextreme abstemiousness of these savagely-armed insects. I was prepared\r\nfor ogres: I find ascetics satisfied with a meagre collation at rare\r\nintervals. A Fly fills their belly for twenty-four hours at least.\r\n\r\nThus passes the late autumn: the Empusæ, more and more temperate from\r\nday to day, hang motionless from the wire gauze. Their natural\r\nabstinence is my best ally, for Flies grow scarce; and a time comes\r\nwhen I should be hard put to it to keep the menageries supplied with\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nDuring the three winter months, nothing stirs. From time to time, on\r\nfine days, I expose the cage to the sun’s rays, in the window. Under\r\nthe influence of this heat-bath, the captives stretch their legs a\r\nlittle, sway from side to side, make up their minds to move about, but\r\nwithout displaying any awakening appetite. The rare Midges that fall to\r\nmy assiduous efforts do not appear to tempt them. It is a rule for them\r\nto spend the cold season in a state of complete abstinence.\r\n\r\nMy cages tell me what must happen outside, during the winter. Ensconced\r\nin the crannies of the rockwork, in the sunniest places, the young\r\nEmpusæ wait, in a state of torpor, for the return of the hot weather.\r\nNotwithstanding the shelter of a heap of stones, there must be painful\r\nmoments when the frost is prolonged and the snow penetrates little by\r\nlittle into the best-protected crevices. No matter: hardier than they\r\nlook, the refugees escape the dangers of the winter season. Sometimes,\r\nwhen the sun is strong, they venture out of their hiding-place and come\r\nto see if spring be nigh.\r\n\r\nSpring comes. We are in March. My prisoners bestir themselves, change\r\ntheir skin. They need victuals. My catering difficulties recommence.\r\nThe House-fly, so easy to catch, is lacking in these days. I fall back\r\nupon earlier Diptera: Eristales, or Drone-flies. The Empusa refuses\r\nthem. They are too big for her and can offer too strenuous a\r\nresistance. She wards off their approach with blows of her mitre.\r\n\r\nA few tender morsels, in the shape of very young Grasshoppers, are\r\nreadily accepted. Unfortunately, such wind-falls do not often find\r\ntheir way into my sweeping-net. Abstinence becomes obligatory until the\r\narrival of the first Butterflies. Henceforth, Pieris brassicæ, the\r\nWhite Cabbage Butterfly, will contribute the greater portion of the\r\nvictuals.\r\n\r\nLet loose in the wire cage, the Pieris is regarded as excellent game.\r\nThe Empusa lies in wait for her, seizes her, but releases her at once,\r\nlacking the strength to overpower her. The Cabbage Butterfly’s great\r\nwings, beating the air, give her shock after shock and compel her to\r\nlet go. I come to the weakling’s assistance and cut the wings of her\r\nprey with my scissors. The maimed ones, still full of life, clamber up\r\nthe trelliswork and are forthwith grabbed by the Empusæ, who, in no way\r\nfrightened by their protests, crunch them up. The dish is to their\r\ntaste and, moreover, plentiful, so much so that there are always some\r\ndespised remnants.\r\n\r\nThe head only and the upper portion of the breast are devoured: the\r\nrest—the plump abdomen, the best part of the thorax, the legs and\r\nlastly, of course, the wing-stumps—is flung aside untouched. Does this\r\nmean that the tenderest and most succulent morsels are chosen? No, for\r\nthe belly is certainly more juicy; and the Empusa refuses it, though\r\nshe eats up her House-fly to the last particle. It is a strategy of\r\nwar. I am again in the presence of a neck-specialist as expert as the\r\nMantis herself in the art of swiftly slaying a victim that struggles\r\nand, in struggling, spoils the meal.\r\n\r\nOnce warned, I soon perceive that the game, be it Fly, Locust,\r\nGrasshopper or Butterfly, is invariably struck in the neck, from\r\nbehind. The first bite is aimed at the point containing the cervical\r\nganglia and produces sudden death or immobility. Complete inertia will\r\nleave the consumer in peace, the essential condition of every\r\nsatisfactory repast.\r\n\r\nThe Devilkin, therefore, frail though she be, possesses the secret of\r\nimmediately destroying the resistance of her prey. She bites at the\r\nback of the neck first, in order to give the finishing stroke. She goes\r\non nibbling around the original attacking-point. In this way, the\r\nButterfly’s head and the upper part of the breast are disposed of. But,\r\nby that time, the huntress is surfeited: she wants so little! The rest\r\nlies on the ground, disdained, not for lack of flavour, but because\r\nthere is too much of it. A Cabbage Butterfly far exceeds the capacity\r\nof the Empusa’s stomach. The Ants will benefit by what is left.\r\n\r\nThere is one other matter to be mentioned, before observing the\r\nmetamorphosis. The position adopted by the young Empusæ in the\r\nwire-gauze cage is invariably the same from start to finish. Gripping\r\nthe trelliswork by the claws of its four hind-legs, the insect occupies\r\nthe top of the dome and hangs motionless, back downwards, with the\r\nwhole of its body supported by the four suspension-points. If it wishes\r\nto move, the front harpoons open, stretch out, grasp a mesh and draw it\r\nto them. When the short walk is over, the lethal arms are brought back\r\nagainst the chest. One may say that it is nearly always the four\r\nhind-shanks which alone support the suspended insect.\r\n\r\nAnd this reversed position, which seems to us so trying, lasts for no\r\nshort while: it is prolonged, in my cages, for ten months without a\r\nbreak. The Fly on the ceiling, it is true, occupies the same attitude;\r\nbut she has her moments of rest: she flies, she walks in a normal\r\nposture, she spreads herself flat in the sun. Besides, her acrobatic\r\nfeats do not cover a long period. The Empusa, on the other hand,\r\nmaintains her curious equilibrium for ten months on end, without a\r\nbreak. Hanging from the trelliswork, back downwards, she hunts, eats,\r\ndigests, dozes, casts her skin, undergoes her transformation, mates,\r\nlays her eggs and dies. She clambered up there when she was still quite\r\nyoung; she falls down, full of days, a corpse.\r\n\r\nThings do not happen exactly like this under natural conditions. The\r\ninsect stands on the bushes back upwards; it keeps its balance in the\r\nregular attitude and turns over only in circumstances that occur at\r\nlong intervals. The protracted suspension of my captives is all the\r\nmore remarkable inasmuch as it is not at all an innate habit of their\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nIt reminds one of the Bats, who hang, head downwards, by their\r\nhind-legs from the roof of their caves. A special formation of the toes\r\nenables birds to sleep on one leg, which automatically and without\r\nfatigue clutches the swaying bough. The Empusa shows me nothing akin to\r\ntheir contrivance. The extremity of her walking-legs has the ordinary\r\nstructure: a double claw at the tip, a double steelyard-hook; and that\r\nis all.\r\n\r\nI could wish that anatomy would show me the working of the muscles and\r\nnerves in those tarsi, in those legs more slender than threads, the\r\naction of the tendons that control the claws and keep them gripped for\r\nten months, unwearied in waking and sleeping. If some dexterous scalpel\r\nshould ever investigate this problem, I can recommend another, even\r\nmore singular than that of the Empusa, the Bat and the bird. I refer to\r\nthe attitude of certain Wasps and Bees during the night’s rest.\r\n\r\nAn Ammophila with red fore-legs (A. holosericea) [37] is plentiful in\r\nmy enclosure towards the end of August and selects a certain\r\nlavender-border for her dormitory. At dusk, especially after a stifling\r\nday, when a storm is brewing, I am sure to find the strange sleeper\r\nsettled there. Never was more eccentric attitude adopted for a night’s\r\nrest! The mandibles bite right into the lavender-stem. Its square shape\r\nsupplies a firmer hold than a round stalk would do. With this one and\r\nonly prop, the animal’s body juts out stiffly, at full length, with\r\nlegs folded. It forms a right angle with the supporting axis, so much\r\nso that the whole weight of the insect, which has turned itself into\r\nthe arm of a lever, rests upon the mandibles.\r\n\r\nThe Ammophila sleeps extended in space by virtue of its mighty jaws. It\r\ntakes an animal to think of a thing like that, which upsets all our\r\npreconceived ideas of repose. Should the threatening storm burst,\r\nshould the stalk sway in the wind, the sleeper is not troubled by her\r\nswinging hammock; at most, she presses her fore-legs for a moment\r\nagainst the tossed mast. As soon as equilibrium is restored, the\r\nfavourite posture, that of the horizontal lever, is resumed. Perhaps\r\nthe mandibles, like the bird’s toes, possess the faculty of gripping\r\ntighter in proportion to the rocking of the wind.\r\n\r\nThe Ammophila is not the only one to sleep in this singular position,\r\nwhich is copied by many others—Anthidia, [38] Odyneri, [39] Euceræ\r\n[40]—and mainly by the males. All grip a stalk with their mandibles and\r\nsleep with their bodies outstretched and their legs folded back. Some,\r\nthe stouter species, allow themselves to rest the tip of their arched\r\nabdomen against the pole.\r\n\r\nThis visit to the dormitory of certain Wasps and Bees does not explain\r\nthe problem of the Empusa; it sets up another one, no less difficult.\r\nIt shows us how deficient we are in insight, when it comes to\r\ndifferentiating between fatigue and rest in the cogs of the animal\r\nmachine. The Ammophila, with the static paradox afforded by her\r\nmandibles; the Empusa, with her claws unwearied by ten months’ hanging,\r\nleave the physiologist perplexed and make him wonder what really\r\nconstitutes rest. In absolute fact, there is no rest, apart from that\r\nwhich puts an end to life. The struggle never ceases; some muscle is\r\nalways toiling, some nerve straining. Sleep, which resembles a return\r\nto the peace of non-existence, is, like waking, an effort, here of the\r\nleg, of the curled tail; there of the claw, of the jaws.\r\n\r\nThe transformation is effected about the middle of May and the adult\r\nEmpusa makes her appearance. She is even more remarkable in figure and\r\nattire than the Praying Mantis. Of her youthful eccentricities, she\r\nretains the pointed mitre, the saw-like arm-guards, the long bust, the\r\nknee-pieces, the three rows of scales on the lower surface of the\r\nbelly; but the abdomen is now no longer twisted into a crook and the\r\nanimal is comelier to look upon. Large pale-green wings, pink at the\r\nshoulder and swift in flight in both sexes, cover the belly, which is\r\nstriped white and green underneath. The male, the dandy sex, adorns\r\nhimself with plumed antennæ, like those of certain Moths, the Bombyx\r\ntribe. In respect of size, he is almost the equal of his mate.\r\n\r\nSave for a few slight structural details, the Empusa is the Praying\r\nMantis. The peasant confuses them. When, in spring, he meets the mitred\r\ninsect, he thinks he sees the common Prègo-Diéu, who is a daughter of\r\nthe autumn. Similar forms would seem to indicate similarity of habits.\r\nIn fact, led away by the extraordinary armour, we should be tempted to\r\nattribute to the Empusa a mode of life even more atrocious than that of\r\nthe Mantis. I myself thought so at first; and any one, relying upon\r\nfalse analogies, would think the same. It is a fresh error: for all her\r\nwarlike aspect, the Empusa is a peaceful creature that hardly repays\r\nthe trouble of rearing.\r\n\r\nInstalled under the gauze bell, whether in assemblies of half-a-dozen\r\nor in separate couples, she at no time loses her placidity. Like the\r\nlarva, she is very abstemious and contents herself with a Fly or two as\r\nher daily ration.\r\n\r\nBig eaters are naturally quarrelsome. The Mantis, bloated with Locusts,\r\nsoon becomes irritated and shows fight. The Empusa, with her frugal\r\nmeals, does not indulge in hostile demonstrations. There is no strife\r\namong neighbours nor any of those sudden unfurlings of the wings so\r\ndear to the Mantis when she assumes the spectral attitude and puffs\r\nlike a startled Adder; never the least inclination for those cannibal\r\nbanquets whereat the sister who has been worsted in the fight is\r\ndevoured. Such atrocities are here unknown.\r\n\r\nUnknown also are tragic nuptials. The male is enterprising and\r\nassiduous and is subjected to a long trial before succeeding. For days\r\nand days, he worries his mate, who ends by yielding. Due decorum is\r\npreserved after the wedding. The feathered groom retires, respected by\r\nhis bride, and does his little bit of hunting, without danger of being\r\napprehended and gobbled up.\r\n\r\nThe two sexes live together in peace and mutual indifference until the\r\nmiddle of July. Then the male, grown old and decrepit, takes counsel\r\nwith himself, hunts no more, becomes shaky in his walk, creeps down\r\nfrom the lofty heights of the trellised dome and at last collapses on\r\nthe ground. His end comes by a natural death. And remember that the\r\nother, the male of the Praying Mantis, ends in the stomach of his\r\ngluttonous spouse.\r\n\r\nThe laying follows close upon the disappearance of the males. The\r\nEmpusa, when about to build her nest, has not the round belly of the\r\nPraying Mantis, rendered heavy and inactive by her fertility. Her\r\nslender figure, still capable of flight, announces a scanty progeny.\r\nHer nest, fixed upon a straw, a twig, a chip of stone, is quite as\r\nsmall a structure as that of the dwarf Mantis (Ameles decolor) and\r\nmeasures two-fifths of an inch, at most, in length. The general shape\r\nis that of a trapezoid, of which the shorter sides are, respectively,\r\nsloping and slightly convex. As a rule, the sloping side is surmounted\r\nby a thread-like appendage, similar to the final spur of the nests of\r\nthe Mantis and the Ameles, but finer in appearance. This is the last\r\ndrop of viscous matter, dried and drawn out. Builders, when their work\r\nis finished, crown the edifice with a green bough and coloured\r\nstreamers. In much the same way, the Mantis tribe set up a mast on the\r\ncompleted nest.\r\n\r\nA very thin grey-wash, formed of dried foam, covers the Empusa’s work,\r\nespecially on the upper surface. Under this delicate glaze, which is\r\neasily rubbed off, the fundamental substance appears, homogeneous,\r\nhorny, pale-red. Six or seven hardly-perceptible furrows divide the\r\nsides into curved sections.\r\n\r\nAfter the hatching, a dozen round orifices open on the top of the\r\nbuilding, in two alternate rows. These are the exit-doors for the young\r\nlarvæ. The slightly projecting rim is continued from each aperture to\r\nthe next in a sort of ribbon with a double row of alternating loops. It\r\nis obvious that the windings of this ribbon are the result of an\r\noscillating movement of the ovipositor in labour. Those exit-holes, so\r\nregular in shape and arrangement, completed by the lateral ribs of the\r\nnest, present the appearance of two dainty mouth-organs placed in\r\njuxtaposition. Each of them corresponds with a cell containing two\r\neggs. The eggs in all, therefore, amount to about a couple of dozen.\r\n\r\nI have not seen the hatching. I do not know whether, as in the Praying\r\nMantis, it is preceded by a transition-stage adapted to facilitate the\r\ndelivery. It may easily be that there is nothing of the kind, since\r\neverything is so well-prepared for the exit. Above the cells is a very\r\nshort exit-hall, free of any obstacle. It is closed merely by a small\r\nquantity of frothy, crumbly matter, which will readily yield to the\r\nmandibles of the new-born larvæ. With this wide passage leading to the\r\nouter air, long legs and slender antennæ cease to be embarrassing\r\nappendages; and the tiny creature might well have the free use of them\r\nfrom the moment of leaving the egg, without going through the primary\r\nlarval stage. Not having seen for myself, I merely mention the probable\r\ncourse of things.\r\n\r\nOne word more on comparative manners. The Mantis goes in for battle and\r\ncannibalism; the Empusa is peaceable and respects her kind. To what\r\ncause are these profound moral differences due, when the organic\r\nstructure is the same? Perhaps to the difference of diet. Frugality, in\r\nfact, softens character, in animals as in men; gross feeding brutalizes\r\nit. The gormandizer gorged with meat and strong drink, a fruitful\r\nsource of savage outbursts, could not possess the gentleness of the\r\nascetic who dips his bread into a cup of milk. The Mantis is that\r\ngormandizer, the Empusa that ascetic.\r\n\r\nGranted. But whence does the one derive her voracious appetite, the\r\nother her temperate ways, when it would seem as though their almost\r\nidentical structure ought to produce an identity of needs? These\r\ninsects tell us, in their fashion, what many have already told us: that\r\npropensities and aptitudes do not depend exclusively upon anatomy; high\r\nabove the physical laws that govern matter rise other laws that govern\r\ninstincts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE-FACED DECTICUS: HIS HABITS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe White-faced Decticus (D. albifrons, Fabr.) stands at the head of\r\nthe Grasshopper clan in my district, both as a singer and as an insect\r\nof imposing presence. He has a grey costume, a pair of powerful\r\nmandibles and a broad ivory face. Without being plentiful, he does not\r\nlet himself be sought in vain. In the height of summer we find him\r\nhopping in the long grass, especially at the foot of the sunny rocks\r\nwhere the turpentine-tree takes root.\r\n\r\nAt the end of July I start a Decticus-menagerie. As a vivarium I adopt\r\na big wire-gauze cover standing on a bed of sifted earth. The\r\npopulation numbers a dozen; and both sexes are equally represented.\r\n\r\nThe question of victuals perplexes me for some time. It seems as though\r\nthe regulation diet ought to be a vegetable one, to judge by the\r\nLocust, who consumes any green thing. I therefore offer my captives the\r\ntastiest and tenderest garden-stuff that my enclosure holds: leaves of\r\nlettuce, chicory and corn-salad. The Dectici scarcely touch it with a\r\ncontemptuous tooth. It is not the food for them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps something tough would suit their strong mandibles better. I try\r\nvarious Graminaceæ, including the glaucous panic-grass, the miauco of\r\nthe Provençal peasant, the Setaria glauca of the botanists, a weed that\r\ninfests the fields after the harvest. The panic-grass is accepted by\r\nthe hungry ones, but it is not the leaves that they devour: they attack\r\nonly the ears, of which they crunch the still tender seeds with visible\r\nsatisfaction. The food is found, at least for the time being. We shall\r\nsee later.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when the rays of the sun visit the cage placed in the\r\nwindow of my study, I serve out the day’s ration, a sheaf of green\r\nspikes of common grass picked outside my door. The Dectici come running\r\nup to the handful, gather round it and, very peaceably, without\r\nquarrelling among themselves, dig with their mandibles between the\r\nbristles of the spikes to extract and nibble the unripe seeds. Their\r\ncostume makes one think of a flock of Guinea-fowl pecking the grain\r\nscattered by the farmer’s wife. When the spikes are robbed of their\r\ntender seeds, the rest is scorned, however urgent the claims of hunger\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\nTo break the monotony of the diet as much as is possible in these\r\ndog-days, when everything is burnt up, I gather a thick-leaved, fleshy\r\nplant which is not too sensitive to the summer heat. This is the common\r\npurslane, another invader of our garden-beds. The new green stuff meets\r\nwith a good reception; and once again the Dectici dig their teeth not\r\ninto the leaves and the juicy stalks, but only into the swollen\r\ncapsules of half-formed grains.\r\n\r\nThis taste for tender seeds surprises me: δηκτικός, biting, fond of\r\nbiting, the lexicon tells us. A name that expresses nothing, a mere\r\nidentification-number, is able to satisfy the nomenclator; in my\r\nopinion, if the name possesses a characteristic meaning and at the same\r\ntime sounds well, it is all the better for it. Such is the case here.\r\nThe Decticus is eminently an insect given to biting. Mind your finger\r\nif the sturdy Grasshopper gets hold of it: he will rip it till the\r\nblood comes.\r\n\r\nAnd can this powerful jaw, of which I have to beware when I handle the\r\ncreature, possess no other function than to chew soft grains? Can a\r\nmill like this have only to grind little unripe seeds? Something has\r\nescaped me. So well-armed with mandibular pincers, so well-endowed with\r\nmasticatory muscles that swell out his cheeks, the Decticus must cut up\r\nsome leathery prey.\r\n\r\nThis time I find the real diet, the fundamental if not the exclusive\r\none. Some good-sized Locusts are let into the cage. I put in it the\r\nspecies mentioned in a note below, [41] now one, now the other, as they\r\nhappen to get caught in my net. A few Grasshoppers [42] are also\r\naccepted, but not so readily. There is every reason to think that, if I\r\nhad had the luck to capture them, the entire Locust and Grasshopper\r\nfamily would have met the same fate, provided that they were not too\r\ninsignificant in size.\r\n\r\nAny fresh meat tasting of Locust or Grasshopper suits my ogres. The\r\nmost frequent victim is the Blue-winged Locust. There is a deplorably\r\nlarge consumption of this species in the cage. This is how things\r\nhappen: as soon as the game is introduced, an uproar ensues in the\r\nmess-room, especially if the Dectici have been fasting for some time.\r\nThey stamp about and, hampered by their long shanks, dart forward\r\nclumsily; the Locusts make desperate bounds, rush to the top of the\r\ncage and there hang on, out of the reach of the Grasshopper, who is too\r\nstout to climb so high. Some are seized at once, as soon as they enter.\r\nThe others, who have taken refuge up in the dome, are only postponing\r\nfor a little while the fate that awaits them. Their turn will come; and\r\nthat soon. Either because they are tired or because they are tempted by\r\nthe green stuff below, they will come down; and the Dectici will be\r\nafter them immediately.\r\n\r\nSpeared by the hunter’s fore-legs, the game is first wounded in the\r\nneck. It is always there, behind the head, that the Locust’s shell\r\ncracks first of all; it is always there that the Decticus probes\r\npersistently before releasing his hold and taking his subsequent meals\r\noff whatever joint he chooses.\r\n\r\nIt is a very judicious bite. The Locust is hard to kill. Even when\r\nbeheaded, he goes on hopping. I have seen some who, though half-eaten,\r\nkick out desperately and succeed, with a supreme effort, in releasing\r\nthemselves and jumping away. In the brushwood, that would be so much\r\ngame lost.\r\n\r\nThe Decticus seems to know all about it. To overcome his prey, so\r\nprompt to escape by means of its two powerful levers, and to render it\r\nhelpless as quickly as possible, he first munches and extirpates the\r\ncervical ganglia, the main seat of innervation. Is this an accident, in\r\nwhich the assassin’s choice plays no part? No, for I see the murder\r\nperformed invariably in the same way when the prey is in possession of\r\nits full strength; and again no, because, when the Locust is offered in\r\nthe form of a fresh corpse, or when he is weak, dying, incapable of\r\ndefence, the attack is made anywhere, at the first spot that presents\r\nitself to the assailant’s jaws. In such cases the Decticus begins\r\neither with a haunch, the favourite morsel, or with the belly, back or\r\nchest. The preliminary bite in the neck is reserved for difficult\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nThis Grasshopper, therefore, despite his dull intellect, possesses the\r\nart of killing scientifically of which we have seen so many instances\r\nelsewhere; [43] but with him it is a rude art, falling within the\r\nknacker’s rather than the anatomist’s domain.\r\n\r\nTwo or three Blue-winged Locusts are none too many for a Decticus’\r\ndaily ration. It all goes down, save the wings and wing-cases, which\r\nare disdained as too tough. In addition, there is a snack of tender\r\nmillet-grains stolen every now and again to make a change from the\r\nbanquet of game. They are big eaters, are my boarders; they surprise me\r\nwith their gormandizing and even more with their easy change from an\r\nanimal to a vegetable diet.\r\n\r\nWith their accommodating and anything but particular stomachs, they\r\ncould render some slight service to agriculture, if there were more of\r\nthem. They destroy the Locusts, many of whom, even in our fields, are\r\nof ill fame; and they nibble, amid the unripe corn, the seeds of a\r\nnumber of plants which are obnoxious to the husbandman.\r\n\r\nBut the Decticus’ claim to the honours of the vivarium rests upon\r\nsomething much better than his feeble assistance in preserving the\r\nfruits of the earth: in his song, his nuptials and his habits we have a\r\nmemorial of the remotest times.\r\n\r\nHow did the insect’s ancestors live, in the palæozoic age? They had\r\ntheir crude and uncouth side, banished from the better-proportioned\r\nfauna of to-day; we catch a vague glimpse of habits now almost out of\r\nuse. It is unfortunate for our curiosity that the fossil remains are\r\nsilent on this magnificent subject.\r\n\r\nLuckily we have one resource left, that of consulting the successors of\r\nthe prehistoric insects. There is reason to believe that the Locustids\r\n[44] of our own period have retained an echo of the ancient customs and\r\ncan tell us something of the manners of olden time. Let us begin by\r\nquestioning the Decticus.\r\n\r\nIn the vivarium the sated herd are lying on their bellies in the sun\r\nand blissfully digesting their food, giving no other sign of life than\r\na gentle swaying of the antennæ. It is the hour of the after-dinner\r\nnap, the hour of enervating heat. From time to time a male gets up,\r\nstrolls solemnly about, raises his wing-cases slightly and utters an\r\noccasional tick-tick. Then he becomes more animated, hurries the pace\r\nof his tune and ends by grinding out the finest piece in his\r\nrepertoire.\r\n\r\nIs he celebrating his wedding? Is his song an epithalamium? I will make\r\nno such statement, for his success is poor if he is really making an\r\nappeal to his fair neighbours. Not one of his group of hearers gives a\r\nsign of attention. Not a female stirs, not one moves from her\r\ncomfortable place in the sun. Sometimes the solo becomes a concerted\r\npiece sung by two or three in chorus. The multiple invitation succeeds\r\nno better. True, their impassive ivory faces give no indication of\r\ntheir real feelings. If the suitors’ ditty indeed exercises any sort of\r\nseduction, no outward sign betrays the fact.\r\n\r\nAccording to all appearances, the clicking is addressed to heedless\r\nears. It rises in a passionate crescendo until it becomes a continuous\r\nrattle. It ceases when the sun vanishes behind a cloud and starts\r\nafresh when the sun shows itself again; but it leaves the ladies\r\nindifferent.\r\n\r\nShe who was lying with her shanks outstretched on the blazing sand does\r\nnot change her position; her antennary threads give not a quiver more\r\nand not a quiver less; she who was gnawing the remains of a Locust does\r\nnot let go the morsel, does not lose a mouthful. To look at those\r\nheartless ones, you would really say that the singer was making a noise\r\nfor the mere pleasure of feeling himself alive.\r\n\r\nIt is a very different matter when, towards the end of August, I\r\nwitness the start of the wedding. The couple finds itself standing face\r\nto face quite casually, without any lyrical prelude whatever.\r\nMotionless, as though turned to stone, with their foreheads almost\r\ntouching, the two exchange caresses with their long antennæ, fine as\r\nhairs. The male seems somewhat preoccupied. He washes his tarsi; with\r\nthe tips of his mandibles he tickles the soles of his feet. From time\r\nto time he gives a stroke of the bow: tick; no more.\r\n\r\nYet one would think that this was the very moment at which to make the\r\nmost of his strong points. Why not declare his flame in a fond couplet,\r\ninstead of standing there, scratching his feet? Not a bit of it. He\r\nremains silent in front of the coveted bride, herself impassive.\r\n\r\nThe interview, a mere exchange of greetings between friends of\r\ndifferent sexes, does not last long. What do they say to each other,\r\nforehead to forehead? Not much, apparently, for soon they separate with\r\nnothing further; and each goes his way where he pleases.\r\n\r\nNext day, the same two meet again. This time, the song, though still\r\nvery brief, is in a louder key than on the day before, while being\r\nstill very far from the burst of sound to which the Decticus will give\r\nutterance long before the pairing. For the rest, it is a repetition of\r\nwhat I saw yesterday: mutual caresses with the antennæ, which limply\r\npat the well-rounded sides.\r\n\r\nThe male does not seem greatly enraptured. He again nibbles his foot\r\nand seems to be reflecting. Alluring though the enterprise may be, it\r\nis perhaps not unattended with danger. Can there be a nuptial tragedy\r\nhere, similar to that which the Praying Mantis has shown us? Can the\r\nbusiness be exceptionally grave? Have patience and you shall see. For\r\nthe moment, nothing more happens.\r\n\r\nA few days later, a little light is thrown upon the subject. The male\r\nis underneath, lying flat on the sand and towered over by his powerful\r\nspouse, who, with her sabre exposed, standing high on her hind-legs,\r\noverwhelms him with her embrace. No, indeed: in this posture the poor\r\nDecticus has nothing of the victor about him! The other, brutally,\r\nwithout respecting the musical-box, is forcing open his wing-cases and\r\nnibbling his flesh just where the belly begins.\r\n\r\nWhich of the two takes the initiative here? Have not the parts been\r\nreversed? She who is usually provoked is now the provoker, employing\r\nrude caresses capable of carrying off the morsel touched. She has not\r\nyielded to him; she has thrust herself upon him, disturbingly,\r\nimperiously. He, lying flat on the ground, quivers and starts, seems\r\ntrying to resist. What outrageous thing is about to happen? I shall not\r\nknow to-day. The floored male releases himself and runs away.\r\n\r\nBut this time, at last, we have it. Master Decticus is on the ground,\r\ntumbled over on his back. Hoisted to the full height of her shanks, the\r\nother, holding her sabre almost perpendicular, covers her prostrate\r\nmate from a distance. The two ventral extremities curve into a hook,\r\nseek each other, meet; and soon from the male’s convulsive loins there\r\nis seen to issue, in painful labour, something monstrous and\r\nunheard-of, as though the creature were expelling its entrails in a\r\nlump.\r\n\r\nIt is an opalescent bag, similar in size and colour to a\r\nmistletoe-berry, a bag with four pockets marked off by faint grooves,\r\ntwo larger ones above and two smaller ones below. In certain cases the\r\nnumber of cells increases and the whole assumes the appearance of a\r\npacket of eggs such as Helix aspersa, the Common Snail, lays in the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe strange concern remains hanging from the lower end of the sabre of\r\nthe future mother, who solemnly retires with the extraordinary wallet,\r\nthe spermatophore, as the physiologists call it, the source of life for\r\nthe ovules, in other words the cruet which will now in due course\r\ntransmit to the proper place the necessary complement for the evolution\r\nof the germs.\r\n\r\nA capsule of this kind is a rare, an infinitely rare thing in the world\r\nof to-day. So far as I know, the Cephalopods [45] and the Scolopendras\r\n[46] are, in our time, the only other animals that make use of the\r\nqueer apparatus. Now Octopuses and Millepedes date back to the earliest\r\nages. The Decticus, another representative of the old world, seems to\r\ntell us that what is a curious exception now might well have been a\r\nmore or less general rule originally, all the more so as we shall come\r\nupon similar incidents in the case of the other Grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nWhen the male has recovered from his shock, he shakes the dust off\r\nhimself and once more begins his merry click-clack. For the present let\r\nus leave him to his joys and follow the mother that is to be, pacing\r\nalong solemnly with her burden, which is fastened with a plug of jelly\r\nas transparent as glass.\r\n\r\nAt intervals she draws herself up on her shanks, curls into a ring and\r\nseizes her opalescent load in her mandibles, nibbling it calmly and\r\nsqueezing it, but without tearing the wrapper or shedding any of the\r\ncontents. Each time, she removes from the surface a particle which she\r\nchews and then chews again slowly, ending by swallowing it.\r\n\r\nThis process is continued for twenty minutes or so. Then the capsule,\r\nnow drained, is torn off in a single piece, all but the jelly plug at\r\nthe end. The huge, sticky mass is not let go for a moment, but is\r\nmunched, ground and kneaded by the insect’s mandibles and at last\r\ngulped down whole.\r\n\r\nAt first I looked upon the horrible banquet as no more than an\r\nindividual aberration, an accident: the Decticus’ behaviour was so\r\nextraordinary; no other instance of it was known to me. But I have had\r\nto yield to the evidence of the facts. Four times in succession I\r\nsurprised my captives dragging their wallet and four times I saw them\r\nsoon tear it, work at it solemnly with their mandibles for hours on end\r\nand finally gulp it down. It is therefore the rule: when its contents\r\nhave reached their destination, the fertilizing capsule, possibly a\r\npowerful stimulant, an unparalleled dainty, is chewed, enjoyed and\r\nswallowed.\r\n\r\nIf this, as we are entitled to believe, is a relic of ancient manners,\r\nwe must admit that the insect of old had singular customs. Réaumur\r\ntells us of the startling operations of the Dragon-flies when pairing.\r\nThis again is a nuptial eccentricity of primeval times.\r\n\r\nWhen the Decticus has finished her strange feast, the end of the\r\napparatus still remains in its place, the end whose most visible part\r\nconsists of two crystalline nipples the size of pepper-corns. To rid\r\nitself of this plug, the insect assumes a curious attitude. The\r\novipositor is driven half-way into the earth, perpendicularly. That\r\nwill be the prop. The long hind-legs straighten out, raise the creature\r\nas high as possible and form a tripod with the sabre.\r\n\r\nThen the insect again curves itself into a complete circle and, with\r\nits mandibles, crumbles to atoms the end of the apparatus, consisting\r\nof a plug of clearest jelly. All these remnants are scrupulously\r\nswallowed. Not a scrap must be lost. Lastly, the ovipositor is washed,\r\nwiped, smoothed with the tips of the palpi. Everything is put in order\r\nagain; nothing remains of the cumbrous load. The normal pose is resumed\r\nand the Decticus goes back to pilfering the ears of millet.\r\n\r\nTo return to the male. Limp and exhausted, as though shattered by his\r\nexploit, he remains where he is, all shrivelled and shrunk. He is so\r\nmotionless that I believe him dead. Not a bit of it! The gallant fellow\r\nrecovers his spirits, picks himself up, polishes himself and goes off.\r\nA quarter of an hour later, when he has taken a few mouthfuls, behold\r\nhim stridulating once more. The tune is certainly lacking in spirit. It\r\nis far from being as brilliant or prolonged as it was before the\r\nwedding; but, after all, the poor old crock is doing his best.\r\n\r\nCan he have any further amorous pretensions? It is hardly likely.\r\nAffairs of that kind, calling for ruinous expenditure, are not to be\r\nrepeated: it would be too much for the works of the organism.\r\nNevertheless, next day and every day after, when a diet of Locusts has\r\nduly renewed his strength, the Decticus scrapes his bow as noisily as\r\never. He might be a novice, instead of a glutted veteran. His\r\npersistence surprises me.\r\n\r\nIf he be really singing to attract the attention of his fair\r\nneighbours, what would he do with a second wife, he who has just\r\nextracted from his paunch a monstrous wallet in which all life’s\r\nsavings were accumulated? He is thoroughly used up. No, once more, in\r\nthe big Grasshopper these things are too costly to be done all over\r\nagain. To-day’s song, despite its gladness, is certainly no\r\nepithalamium.\r\n\r\nAnd, if you watch him closely, you will see that the singer no longer\r\nresponds to the teasing of the passers’ antennæ. The ditties become\r\nfainter from day to day and occur less frequently. In a fortnight the\r\ninsect is dumb. The dulcimer no longer sounds, for lack of vigour in\r\nthe player.\r\n\r\nAt last the decrepit Decticus, who now scarcely touches food, seeks a\r\npeaceful retreat, sinks to the ground exhausted, stretches out his\r\nshanks in a last throe and dies. As it happens, the widow passes that\r\nway, sees the deceased and, breathing eternal remembrance, gnaws off\r\none of his thighs.\r\n\r\nThe Green Grasshopper behaves similarly. A couple isolated in a cage\r\nare subjected to a special watch. I am present at the end of the\r\npairing, when the future mother is carrying, fixed to the point of her\r\nsword, the pretty raspberry which will occupy our attention later. [47]\r\nDebilitated by recent happenings, the male at this moment is mute. Next\r\nday, his strength returns; and you hear him singing as ardently as\r\never. He stridulates while the mother is scattering her eggs over the\r\nground; he goes on making a noise long after the laying is done and\r\nwhen nothing more is wanted to perpetuate the race.\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that this persistent singing has not an amorous\r\nappeal for its object: by this time, all of that is over, quite over.\r\nLastly, one day or another, life fails and the instrument is dumb. The\r\neager singer is no more. The survivor gives him a funeral copied from\r\nthat of the Decticus: she devours the best bits of him. She loved him\r\nso much that she had to eat him up.\r\n\r\nThese cannibal habits recur in most of the Grasshopper tribe, without\r\nhowever equalling the atrocities of the Praying Mantis, who treats her\r\nlovers as dead game while they are still full of life. The Decticus\r\nmother, the Green Grasshopper and the rest at least wait until the poor\r\nwretches are dead.\r\n\r\nI will except the Ephippiger, who is so meek in appearance. In my cage,\r\nwhen laying-time is at hand, she has no scruples about taking a bite at\r\nher companions, without possessing the excuse of hunger. Most of the\r\nmales end in this lamentable fashion, half-devoured. The mutilated\r\nvictim protests; he would rather, he could indeed go on living. Having\r\nno other means of defence, he produces with his bow a few grating\r\nsounds which this time decidedly are not a nuptial song. Dying with a\r\ngreat hole in his belly, he utters his plaint in a like manner as\r\nthough he were rejoicing in the sun. His instrument strikes the same\r\nnote whether it express sorrow or gladness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE-FACED DECTICUS: THE LAYING AND THE HATCHING OF THE EGGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe White-faced Decticus is an African insect that in France hardly\r\nventures beyond the borders of Provence and Languedoc. She wants the\r\nsun that ripens the olives. Can it be that a high temperature acts as a\r\nstimulus to her matrimonial eccentricities, or are we to look upon\r\nthese as family customs, independent of climate? Do things happen under\r\nfrosty skies just as they do under a burning sun?\r\n\r\nI go for my information to another Decticus, the Alpine Analota (A.\r\nalpina, Yersin), who inhabits the high ridges of Mont Ventoux, [48]\r\nwhich are covered with snow for half the year. Many a time, during my\r\nold botanical expeditions, I had noticed the portly insect hopping\r\namong the stones from one bit of turf to the next. This time, I do not\r\ngo in search of it: it reaches me by post. Following my indications, an\r\nobliging forester [49] climbs up there twice in the first fortnight of\r\nAugust and brings me back the wherewithal to fill a cage comfortably.\r\n\r\nIn shape and colouring it is a curious specimen of the Grasshopper\r\nfamily. Satin-white underneath, it has the upper part sometimes\r\nolive-black, sometimes bright-green or pale-brown. The organs of flight\r\nare reduced to mere vestiges. The female has as wing-cases two short\r\nwhite scales, some distance apart; the male shelters under the edge of\r\nhis corselet two little concave plates, also white, but laid one on top\r\nof the other, the left on the right.\r\n\r\nThese two tiny cupolas, with bow and sounding-board, rather suggest, on\r\na smaller scale, the musical instrument of the Ephippiger, whom the\r\nmountain insect resembles to some extent in general appearance.\r\n\r\nI do not know what sort of tune cymbals so small as these can produce.\r\nI do not remember ever hearing them in their native haunts; and three\r\nmonths’ home breeding gives me no further information in this respect.\r\nThough they lead a joyous life, my captives are always dumb.\r\n\r\nThe exiles do not seem greatly to regret their cold peaks, among the\r\norange poppies and saxifrages of arctic climes. What used they to\r\nbrowse upon up there? The Alpine meadow-grass, Mont-Cenis violets,\r\nAllioni’s bell-flower? I do not know. In the absence of Alpine grasses,\r\nI give them the common endive from my garden. They accept it without\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nThey also accept such Locusts as can offer only a feeble resistance;\r\nand the diet alternates between animal and vegetable fare. They even\r\npractise cannibalism. If one of my Alpine visitors limps and drags a\r\nleg, the others eat him up. So far I have seen nothing striking: these\r\nare the usual Grasshopper manners.\r\n\r\nThe interesting sight is the pairing, which occurs suddenly, without\r\nany prelude. The meeting takes place sometimes on the ground, sometimes\r\non the wirework of the cage. In the latter case, the sword-bearer,\r\nfirmly hooked to the trellis, supports the whole weight of the couple.\r\nThe other is back downwards, his head pointing to his mate’s tail. With\r\nhis long, fleshy-shanked hind-legs, he gets a grip of her sides; with\r\nhis four front legs, often also with his mandibles, he grasps and\r\nsqueezes the sabre, which projects slantwise. Thus hanging to this sort\r\nof greased pole, he operates in space.\r\n\r\nWhen the meeting takes place on the ground, the couple occupy the same\r\nposition, only the male is lying on his back in the sand. In both cases\r\nthe result is an opal grain which, in the visible part of it, resembles\r\nin shape and size the swollen end of a grape-pip.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this object is in position, the male decamps at full speed.\r\nCan he be in danger? Possibly, to judge from what I have seen. I admit\r\nthat I have seen it only once.\r\n\r\nThe bride in this case was grappling with two rivals. One of them,\r\nhanging to the sabre, was at work in due form behind; the other, in\r\nfront, tightly clawed and with his belly ripped open, was waving his\r\nlimbs in vain protest against the harpy crunching him impassively in\r\nsmall mouthfuls. I had before my eyes, under even more atrocious\r\nconditions, the horrors which the Praying Mantis had shown me in the\r\nold days: unbridled rut; carnage and voluptuousness in one; a\r\nreminiscence perhaps of ancient savagery.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the male, a dwarf by comparison with the female, hastens to\r\nrun away as soon as his task is consummated. The deserted one makes no\r\nmovement. Then, after waiting twenty minutes or so, she curves herself\r\ninto a ring and proceeds to enjoy the final banquet. She pulls the\r\nsticky raisin-pip into shreds which are chewed with grave appreciation\r\nand then gulped down. It takes her more than an hour to swallow the\r\nthing. When not a crumb remains, she descends from the wire gauze and\r\nmingles with the herd. Her eggs will be laid in a day or two.\r\n\r\nThe proof is established. The matrimonial habits of the White-faced\r\nDecticus are not an exception due to the heat of the climate: the\r\nGrasshopper from the cold peaks shares them and surpasses them.\r\n\r\nWe will return to the big Decticus with the ivory face. The laying\r\nfollows close upon the strange events which we have described. It is\r\ndone piecemeal, as the ovaries ripen. Firmly planted on her six legs,\r\nthe mother bends her abdomen into a semicircle and drives her sabre\r\nperpendicularly into the soil, which, consisting in my cages of sifted\r\nearth, presents no serious resistance. The ovipositor therefore\r\ndescends without hesitation and enters up to the hilt, that is to say,\r\nto a depth of about an inch.\r\n\r\nFor nearly fifteen minutes, absolute immobility. This is the time when\r\nthe eggs are being laid. At last the sabre comes up a little way and\r\nthe abdomen swings briskly from side to side, communicating an\r\nalternate transversal movement to the implement. This tends to scrape\r\nout and widen the sunken hole; it also has the effect of releasing from\r\nthe walls earthy materials which fill up the bottom of the cavity.\r\nThereupon the ovipositor, which is half in and half out, rams down this\r\ndust. It comes up a short distance and then dips repeatedly, with a\r\nsudden, jerky movement. We should work in the same way with a stick to\r\nram down the earth in a perpendicular hole. Thus alternating the\r\ntransversal swing of the sabre with the blows of the rammer, the mother\r\ncovers up the well pretty quickly.\r\n\r\nThe external traces of the work have still to be done away with. The\r\ninsect’s legs, which I expected to see brought into play, remain\r\ninactive and keep the position adopted for laying the eggs. The sabre\r\nalone scratches, sweeps and smooths the ground with its point, very\r\nclumsily, it must be admitted.\r\n\r\nNow all is in order. The abdomen and the ovipositor are restored to\r\ntheir normal positions. The mother allows herself a moment’s rest and\r\ngoes to take a turn in the neighbourhood. Soon she comes back to the\r\nsite where she has already laid her eggs and, very near the original\r\nspot, which she recognizes clearly, she drives in her tool afresh. The\r\nsame proceedings as before are repeated.\r\n\r\nFollow another rest, another exploration of the vicinity, another\r\nreturn to the place already sown. For the third time the pointed stake\r\ndescends, only a very slight distance away from the previous hole.\r\nDuring the brief hour that I am watching her, I see her resume her\r\nlaying five times, after breaking off to take a little stroll in the\r\nneighbourhood; and the points selected are always very close together.\r\n\r\nOn the following days, at varying intervals, the sowing is renewed for\r\na certain number of times which I am not able to state exactly. In the\r\ncase of each of these partial layings, the site changes, now here, now\r\nthere, as this or that spot is deemed the more propitious.\r\n\r\nWhen everything is finished, I examine the little pits in which the\r\nDecticus placed her eggs. There are no packets in a foamy sheath, such\r\nas the Locust supplies; no cells either. The eggs lie singly, without\r\nany protection. I gather three score as the total product of one\r\nmother. They are of a pale lilac-grey and are drawn out shuttlewise, in\r\na narrow ellipsoid five or six millimetres long. [50]\r\n\r\nThe same isolation marks those of the Grey Decticus, which are black;\r\nthose of the Vine Ephippiger, which are ashen-grey; and those of the\r\nAlpine Analota, which are pale-lilac. The eggs of the Green\r\nGrasshopper, which are a very dark olive-brown and, like those of the\r\nWhite-faced Decticus, about sixty in number, are sometimes arranged\r\nsingly and sometimes stuck together in little clusters.\r\n\r\nThese different examples show us that the Grasshoppers plant with a\r\ndibble. Instead of packing their seeds in little casks of hardened\r\nfoam, like the Locusts, they put them into the earth one by one or in\r\nvery small clusters.\r\n\r\nThe hatching is worth examination; I will explain why presently. I\r\ntherefore gather plenty of eggs of the big Decticus at the end of\r\nAugust and place them in a small glass jar with a layer of sand.\r\nWithout undergoing any apparent modification, they spend eight months\r\nhere under cover, sheltered from the frosts, the showers and the\r\noverpowering heat of the sun that would await them under natural\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nWhen June comes, I often meet young Dectici in the fields. Some are\r\nalready half their adult size, which is evidence of an early appearance\r\ndating back to the first fine days of the year. Nevertheless my jar\r\nshows no signs of any imminent hatching. I find the eggs just as I\r\ngathered them nine months ago, neither wrinkled nor tarnished, wearing,\r\non the contrary, a most healthy look. What causes this indefinitely\r\nprolonged delay?\r\n\r\nA suspicion occurs to me. The eggs of the Grasshopper tribe are planted\r\nin the earth like seeds. They are there exposed, without any kind of\r\nprotection, to the watery influence of the snow and the rain. Those in\r\nmy jar have spent two-thirds of the year in a state of comparative\r\ndryness. Perhaps, in order to hatch, they lack what grain absolutely\r\nneeds in order to sprout. Animal seeds as they are, they may yet\r\nrequire under earth the moisture necessary to vegetable seeds. Let us\r\ntry.\r\n\r\nI place at the bottom of some glass tubes, to enable me to make certain\r\nobservations which I have in mind, a pinch of backward eggs taken from\r\nmy collection; and on the top I heap lightly a layer of very fine, damp\r\nsand. The receptacle is closed with a plug of wet cotton, which will\r\nmaintain a constant moisture in the interior. The column of sand\r\nmeasures about an inch, which is very much the depth at which the\r\novipositor places the eggs. Any one seeing my preparations and\r\nunacquainted with their object would hardly suspect them of being\r\nincubators; he would be more likely to think them the apparatus of a\r\nbotanist who was experimenting with seeds.\r\n\r\nMy anticipation was correct. Favoured by the high temperature of the\r\nsummer solstice, the Grasshopper seed does not take long to sprout. The\r\neggs swell; the front end of each is spotted with two dark dots, the\r\nrudiments of the eyes. It is quite evident that the bursting of the\r\nshell is near at hand.\r\n\r\nI spend a fortnight in keeping a tedious watch at every hour of the\r\nday: I have to surprise the young Decticus actually leaving the egg, if\r\nI want to solve a question that has long been vexing my mind. The\r\nquestion is this: the Grasshopper’s egg is buried at a varying depth,\r\naccording to the length of the ovipositor or dibble. An inch is about\r\nthe most for the seeds of the best-equipped insects in our parts. Now\r\nthe newborn Decticus, hopping awkwardly in the grass at the approach of\r\nsummer, is, like the adult, endowed with a pair of very long tentacles,\r\nvying with hairs for slenderness; he carries behind him two\r\nextraordinary legs, two enormous hinged levers, a pair of\r\njumping-stilts that would be very inconvenient for ordinary walking.\r\nHow does the feeble little creature set to work, with this cumbrous\r\nluggage, to emerge from the earth? By what artifice does it manage to\r\nclear a passage through the rough soil? With its antennary plumes,\r\nwhich an atom of sand can break, with its immense shanks, which the\r\nleast effort is enough to disjoint, the mite is obviously incapable of\r\nreaching the surface and freeing itself.\r\n\r\nThe miner going underground puts on a protective dress. The little\r\nGrasshopper also, making a hole in the earth in the opposite direction,\r\nmust don an overall for emerging from the earth; he must possess a\r\nsimpler, more compact transition-form, which enables him to come out\r\nthrough the sand, a delivery-shape analogous to that which the Cicada\r\nand the Praying Mantis use at the moment of issuing, one from his twig,\r\nthe other from the labyrinth of his nest.\r\n\r\nReality and logic here agree. The Decticus, in point of fact, does not\r\nleave the egg in the form in which I see him, the day after his birth,\r\nhopping on the lawn; he possesses a temporary structure better-suited\r\nto the difficulties of the emergence. Coloured a delicate flesh-white,\r\nthe tiny creature is cased in a scabbard which keeps the six legs\r\nflattened against the abdomen, stretching backwards, inert. In order to\r\nslip more easily under the ground, he has his shanks tied up beside his\r\nbody. The antennæ, those other irksome appendages, are motionless,\r\npressed against the parcel.\r\n\r\nThe head is very much bent against the chest. With its big, black\r\nocular specks and its undecided and rather bloated mask, it suggests a\r\ndiver’s helmet. The neck opens wide at the back and, with a slow\r\nthrobbing, by turns swells and subsides. That is the motor. The\r\nnew-born insect moves along with the aid of its occipital hernia. When\r\nuninflated, the fore-part pushes back the damp sand a little way and\r\nslips into it by digging a tiny pit; then, blown out, it becomes a\r\nknob, which moulds itself and finds a support in the depression\r\nobtained. Then the rear-end contracts; and this gives a step forward.\r\nEach thrust of the locomotive blister means nearly a millimetre [51]\r\ntraversed.\r\n\r\nIt is pitiful to see this budding flesh, scarcely tinged with pink,\r\nknocking with its dropsical neck and ramming the rough soil. The animal\r\nglair, not yet quite hardened, struggles painfully with stone; and its\r\nefforts are so well directed that, in the space of a morning, a gallery\r\nopens, either straight or winding, an inch long and as wide as an\r\naverage straw. In this way the harassed insect reaches the surface.\r\n\r\nHalf-caught in its exit-shaft, the disinterred one halts, waits for its\r\nstrength to return and then for the last time swells its occipital\r\nhernia as far as it will go and bursts the sheath that has protected it\r\nso far. The creature throws off its miner’s overall.\r\n\r\nHere at last is the Decticus in his youthful shape, quite pale still,\r\nbut darker the next day and a regular blackamoor compared with the\r\nadult. As a prelude to the ivory face of a riper age, he sports a\r\nnarrow white stripe under his hinder thighs.\r\n\r\nLittle Decticus, hatched before my eyes, life opens for you very\r\nharshly! Many of your kindred must die of exhaustion before attaining\r\ntheir freedom. In my tubes I see numbers who, stopped by a grain of\r\nsand, succumb half-way and become furred with a sort of silky mildew.\r\nThe mouldy part soon absorbs their poor little remains. When performed\r\nwithout my assistance, the coming to the light of day must be attended\r\nwith even greater dangers. The usual soil is coarse and baked by the\r\nsun. Without a fall of rain, how do they manage, these immured ones?\r\n\r\nMore fortunate in my tubes with their sifted and wetted mould, here you\r\nare outside, you little white-striped nigger; you bite at the\r\nlettuce-leaf which I have given you; you leap about gaily in the cage\r\nwhere I have housed you. It would be easy to rear you, I can see, but\r\nit would not give me much fresh information. Let us then part company.\r\nI restore you to liberty. In return for what you have taught me, I\r\nbestow upon you the grass and the Locusts in the garden.\r\n\r\nThanks to you, I know that Grasshoppers, in order to leave the ground\r\nin which the eggs are laid, possess a provisional shape, a primary\r\nlarval stage, which keeps those too cumbrous parts, the long legs and\r\nantennæ, swathed in a common sheath; I know that this sort of mummy,\r\nfit only to lengthen and shorten itself a little, has for an organ of\r\nlocomotion a hernia in the neck, a throbbing blister, an original piece\r\nof mechanism which I have never seen used elsewhere as an aid to\r\nprogression. [52]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE-FACED DECTICUS: THE INSTRUMENT OF SOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nArt has three fields which it may cultivate in the realm of natural\r\nobjects: form, colour and sound. The sculptor uses form and imitates\r\nits perfection in so far as the chisel is able to imitate life. The\r\ndraughtsman, likewise a copyist, seeks in black and white to give the\r\nillusion of relief on a flat surface. To the difficulties of drawing\r\nthe painter adds those of colour, which are no less great.\r\n\r\nAn inexhaustible model sits to all three. Rich though the painter’s\r\npalette be, it will always be inferior to that of reality. Nor will the\r\nsculptor’s chisel ever exhaust the treasures of the plastic art in\r\nnature. Form and colour, beauty of outline and play of light: these are\r\nall taught by the contemplation of actual things. They are imitated,\r\nthey are combined according to our tastes, but they are not invented.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, our music has no prototype in the symphony of\r\ncreated things. Certainly there is no lack of sounds, faint or loud,\r\nsweet and solemn. The wind roaring through the storm-tossed woods, the\r\nwaves curling and breaking on the beach, the thunder growling in the\r\nechoing clouds stir us with their majestic notes; the breeze filtering\r\nthrough the tiny foliage of the pine-trees, the Bees humming over the\r\nspring flowers charm every ear endowed with any delicacy; but these are\r\nmonotonous noises, with no connection. Nature has superb sounds; she\r\nhas no music.\r\n\r\nHowling, braying, grunting, neighing, bellowing, bleating, yelping:\r\nthese exhaust the phonetics of our near neighbours in organization. A\r\nmusical score composed of such elements would be called a hullabaloo.\r\nMan, forming a striking exception at the top of the scale of these\r\nmakers of raucous noises, took it into his head to sing. An attribute\r\nwhich no other shares with him, the attribute of coordinated sounds\r\nwhence springs the incomparable gift of speech, led him on to\r\nscientific vocal exercises. In the absence of a model, it must have\r\nbeen a laborious apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nWhen our prehistoric ancestor, to celebrate his return from hunting the\r\nMammoth, intoxicated himself with sour tipple brewed from raspberries\r\nand sloes, what can have issued from his hoarse larynx? An orthodox\r\nmelody? Certainly not; hoarse shouts, rather, capable of shaking the\r\nroof of his cave. The loudness of the cry constituted its merit. The\r\nprimitive song is found to this day when men’s throats are fired in\r\ntaverns instead of caverns.\r\n\r\nAnd this tenor, with his crude vocal efforts, was already an adept at\r\nguiding his pointed flint to engrave on ivory the effigy of the\r\nmonstrous animal which he had captured; he knew how to embellish his\r\nidol’s cheeks with red chalk; he knew how to paint his own face with\r\ncoloured grease. There were plenty of models for form and colour but\r\nnone for rhythmic sounds.\r\n\r\nWith progress came the musical instrument, as an adjunct to those first\r\nguttural attempts. Men blew down tubes taken all in one piece from the\r\nsappy branches; they produced sounds from the barley-stalks and made\r\nwhistles out of reeds. The shell of a Snail, held between two fingers\r\nof the closed fist, imitated the Partridge’s call; a trumpet formed of\r\na wide strip of bark rolled into a horn reproduced the bellowing of the\r\nBull; a few gut-strings stretched across the empty shell of a calabash\r\ngrated out the first notes of our stringed instruments; a Goat’s\r\nbladder, fixed on a solid frame, was the original drum; two flat\r\npebbles struck together at measured intervals led the way for the click\r\nof the castagnettes. Such must have been the primitive musical\r\nmaterials, materials still preserved by the child, which, with its\r\nsimplicity in things artistic, is so strongly reminiscent of the big\r\nchild of yore.\r\n\r\nClassical antiquity knew no others, as witness the shepherds of\r\nTheocritus and Virgil.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Silvestrem tenui musam meditaris avena,\r\n\r\n\r\nsays Meliboeus to Tityrus. [53]\r\n\r\nWhat are we to make of this oat-straw, this frail shepherd’s pipe, as\r\nthey used to make us translate it in my young days? Did the poet write\r\navena tenui by way of a rhetorical figure, or was he describing a\r\nreality? I vote for the reality, having myself in the old days heard a\r\nconcert of shepherd’s pipes.\r\n\r\nIt was in Corsica, at Ajaccio. In gratitude for a handful of\r\nsugar-plums, some small boys of the neighbourhood came one day and\r\nserenaded me. Quite unexpectedly, in gusts of untutored harmony,\r\nstrange sounds of rare sweetness reached my ears. I ran to the window.\r\nThere stood the orchestra, none taller than a jack-boot, gathered\r\nsolemnly in a ring, with the leader in the middle. Most of them had at\r\ntheir lips a green onion-stem, distended spindlewise; others a stubble\r\nstraw, a bit of reed not yet hardened by maturity.\r\n\r\nThey blew into these, or rather they sang a vocero, to a grave measure,\r\nperhaps a relic of the Greeks. Certainly, it was not music as we\r\nunderstand it; still less was it a meaningless noise; but it was a\r\nvague, undulating melody, abounding in artless irregularities, a medley\r\nof pretty sounds in which the sibilations of the straw threw into\r\nrelief the bleating of the swollen stalks. I stood amazed at the\r\nonion-stem symphony. Very much so must the shepherds of the eclogue\r\nhave gone to work, avena tenui; very much so must the bridal\r\nepithalamium have been sung in the Reindeer period.\r\n\r\nYes, the simple melody of my Corsican youngsters, a real humming of\r\nBees on the rosemaries, has left a lasting trace in my memory. I can\r\nhear it now. It taught me the value of the rustic pipes, once so\r\nconstantly celebrated in a literature that is now old-fashioned. How\r\nfar removed are we from those simple joys! To charm the populace in\r\nthese days you need ophicleides, saxhorns, trombones, cornets, every\r\nimaginable sort of brass, with big drums and little drums and, to beat\r\ntime, a gun-shot. That’s what progress does.\r\n\r\nThree-and-twenty centuries ago, Greece assembled at Delphi for the\r\nfestivals of the sun, Phœbus with the golden locks. Thrilled with\r\nreligious emotion she listened to the Hymn of Apollo, a melody of a few\r\nlines, barely supported here and there by a scanty chord on the flute\r\nand cithara. Hailed as a masterpiece, the sacred song was engraved on\r\nmarble tablets which the archæologists have recently exhumed.\r\n\r\nThe venerable strains, the oldest in musical records, have been heard\r\nin my time in the ancient theatre at Orange, a ruin in stone worthy of\r\nthat ruin of sound. I was not present at the performance, being kept\r\naway by my habit of running to the west whenever there are fireworks in\r\nthe east. One of my friends, a man gifted with a very sensitive ear,\r\nwent; and he said to me afterwards:\r\n\r\n“There were probably ten thousand people forming the audience in the\r\nenormous amphitheatre. I very much doubt whether one of them understood\r\nthat music of another age. As for me, I felt as if I were listening to\r\na blind man’s plaintive ditty and I looked round involuntarily for the\r\ndog holding the cup.”\r\n\r\nThe barbarian, to turn the Greek masterpiece into a stupid wail! Was it\r\nirreverence on his part? No, but it was incapacity. His ear, trained in\r\naccordance with other rules, was unable to take pleasure in artless\r\nsounds which had become strange and even disagreeable owing to their\r\ngreat age. What my friend lacked, what we all lack is the perception of\r\nthose primitive niceties which have been stifled by the centuries. To\r\nenjoy the Hymn to Apollo, we should have to go back to the simplicity\r\nof soul which one day made me think the buzzing of the onion-stalks\r\ndelightful. And that we shall never do.\r\n\r\nBut, if our music need not draw its inspiration from the Delphic\r\nmarbles, our statuary and our architecture will always find models of\r\nincomparable perfection in the work of the Greeks. The art of sounds,\r\nhaving no prototype imposed on it by natural facts, is liable to\r\nchange: with our fickle tastes, that which is perfect in music to-day\r\nbecomes vulgar and commonplace to-morrow. The art of forms, on the\r\ncontrary, being based on the immutable foundation of reality, always\r\nsees the beautiful where previous centuries saw it.\r\n\r\nThere is no musical type anywhere, not even in the song of the\r\nNightingale, celebrated by Buffon [54] in grandiloquent terms. I have\r\nno wish to shock anybody; but why should I not give my opinion?\r\nBuffon’s style and the Nightingale’s song both leave me cold. The first\r\nhas too much rhetoric about it and not enough sincere emotion. The\r\nsecond, a magnificent jewel-case of ill-assorted pearls of sound, makes\r\nso slight an appeal to the soul that a penny jug, filled with water and\r\nfurnished with a whistle, will enable the lips of a child to reproduce\r\nthe celebrated songster’s finest trills. A little earthenware machine,\r\nwarbling at the player’s will, rivals the Nightingale.\r\n\r\nAbove the bird, that glorious production of a vibrating air-column,\r\ncreatures roar and bray and grunt, until we come to man, who alone\r\nspeaks and really sings. Below the bird, they croak or are silent. The\r\nbellows of the lungs have two efflorescences separated by enormous\r\nempty spaces filled with formless sounds. Lower down still is the\r\ninsect, which is much earlier in date. This first-born of the dwellers\r\non the earth is also the first singer. Deprived of the breath which\r\ncould set the vocal cords vibrating, it invents the bow and friction,\r\nof which man is later to make such wonderful use.\r\n\r\nVarious Beetles produce a noise by sliding one rugged surface over\r\nanother. The Capricorn moves his corseleted segment over its junction\r\nwith the rest of the thorax; the Pine Cockchafer, [55] with his great\r\nfan-shaped antennæ, rubs his last dorsal segment with the edge of his\r\nwing-cases; the Copris [56] and many more know no other method. To tell\r\nthe truth, these scrapers do not produce a musical sound, but rather a\r\ncreaking like that of a weathercock on its rusty pin, a thin, sharp\r\nsound with no resonance in it.\r\n\r\nAmong these inexperienced scrapers, I will select the Bolboceras (B.\r\ngallicus, Muls.), [57] as deserving honourable mention. Round as a\r\nball, sporting a horn on his forehead, like the Spanish Copris, whose\r\nstercoral tastes he does not share, this pretty Beetle loves the\r\npine-woods in my neighbourhood and digs himself a burrow in the sand,\r\nleaving it in the evening twilight with the gentle chirp of a well-fed\r\nnestling under its mother’s wing. Though habitually silent, he makes a\r\nnoise at the least disturbance. A dozen of him imprisoned in a box will\r\nprovide you with a delightful symphony, very faint, it is true: you\r\nhave to hold the box close to your ear to hear it. Compared with him,\r\nthe Capricorn, Copris, Pine Cockchafer and the rest are rustic\r\nfiddlers. In their case, after all, it is not singing, but rather an\r\nexpression of fear, I might almost say, a cry of anguish, a moan. The\r\ninsect utters it only in a moment of danger and never, so far as I\r\nknow, at the time of its wedding.\r\n\r\nThe real musician, who expresses his gladness by strokes of the bow and\r\ncymbals, dates much farther back. He preceded the insects endowed with\r\na superior organization, the Beetle, the Bee, the Fly, the Butterfly,\r\nwho prove their higher rank by complete transformations; he is closely\r\nconnected with the rude beginnings of the geological period. The\r\nsinging insect, in fact, belongs exclusively either to the order of the\r\nHemiptera, including the Cicadæ, or to that of the Orthoptera,\r\nincluding the Grasshoppers and Crickets. Its incomplete metamorphoses\r\nlink it with those primitive races whose records are inscribed in our\r\ncoal-seams. It is one of the first that mingled the sounds of life with\r\nthe vague murmuring of inert things. It was singing before the reptile\r\nhad learnt to breathe.\r\n\r\nThis shows, from the mere point of view of sound, the futility of those\r\ntheories of ours which try to explain the world by the automatic\r\nevolution of progress nascent in the primitive cell. All is yet dumb;\r\nand already the insect is stridulating as correctly as it does to-day.\r\nPhonetics start with an apparatus which the ages will hand down to one\r\nanother without changing any essential part of it. Then, though the\r\nlungs have appeared, we have silence, save for the heavy breathing of\r\nthe nostrils. But lo, one day, the Frog croaks; and soon, with no\r\npreparation, there are mingled with this hideous concert the trills of\r\nthe Quail, the whistled stanzas of the Thrush and the Warbler’s musical\r\nstrains. The larynx in its highest form has come into existence. What\r\nwill the late-comers do with it? The Ass and the Wild Boar give us our\r\nreply. We find something worse than marking time, we find an enormous\r\nretrogression, until one last bound brings us to man’s own larynx.\r\n\r\nIn this genesis of sounds it is impossible to talk authoritatively of a\r\nsteady progression which makes the middling follow on the bad and the\r\nexcellent on the middling. We see nothing but abrupt excursions,\r\nintermittences, recoils, sudden expansions not foretold by what has\r\ngone before nor continued by that which follows; we find nothing but a\r\nriddle whose solution does not lie in the virtues of the cell alone,\r\nthat easy pillow for whoso has not the courage to search deeper.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave the question of origins, that inaccessible domain, and\r\ncome down to facts; let us cross-examine a few representatives of those\r\nold races who were the earliest exponents of the art of sounds and took\r\nit into their heads to sing at a time when the mud of the first\r\ncontinents was hardening; let us ask them how their instrument is\r\nconstructed and what is the object of their ditty.\r\n\r\nThe Grasshopper, so remarkable both for the length and thickness of her\r\nhinder thighs and for her ovipositor, the sabre or dibble which plants\r\nher eggs, is one of the chief performers in the entomological concert.\r\nIndeed, if we except the Cicada, who is often confused with her, she is\r\nresponsible for the greater part of the noise. Only one of the\r\nOrthoptera surpasses her; and that is the Cricket, her near neighbour.\r\nLet us first listen to the White-faced Decticus.\r\n\r\nThe performance begins with a hard, sharp, almost metallic sound, very\r\nlike that emitted by the Thrush keeping a sharp look-out while he\r\nstuffs himself with olives. It consists of a series of isolated notes,\r\ntick-tick, with a longish pause between them. Then, with a gradual\r\ncrescendo, the song develops into a rapid clicking in which the\r\nfundamental tick-tick is accompanied by a continuous droning bass. At\r\nthe end the crescendo becomes so loud that the metallic note disappears\r\nand the sound is transformed into a mere rustle, a frrrr-frrrr-frrrr of\r\nthe greatest rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe performer goes on like this for hours, with alternating strophes\r\nand rests. In calm weather, the song, at its height, can be heard\r\ntwenty steps away. That is no great distance. The noise made by the\r\nCicada and the Cricket carries much farther.\r\n\r\nHow are the strains produced? The books which I am able to consult\r\nleave me perplexed. They tell me of the “mirror,” a thin, quivering\r\nmembrane which glistens like a blade of mica; but how is this membrane\r\nmade to vibrate? That is what they either do not tell us or else tell\r\nus very vaguely and inaccurately, talking of a friction of the\r\nwing-cases, mutual rubbing of the nervures; and that is all.\r\n\r\nI should like a more lucid explanation, for a Grasshopper’s\r\nmusical-box, I feel certain in advance, must have an exact mechanism of\r\nits own. Let us therefore look into the matter, even though we have to\r\nrepeat observations already perhaps made by others, but unknown to a\r\nrecluse like myself, whose whole library consists of a few old odd\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nThe Decticus’ wing-cases widen at the base and form on the insect’s\r\nback a flat sunken surface shaped like an elongated triangle. This is\r\nthe sounding-board. Here the left wing-case folds over the right and,\r\nwhen at rest, completely covers the latter’s musical apparatus. The\r\nmost distinct and, from time immemorial, the best-known part of it is\r\nthe mirror, thus called because of the shininess of its thin oval\r\nmembrane, set in the frame of a nervure. It is very like the skin of a\r\ndrum, of an exquisitely delicate tympanum, with this difference, that\r\nit sounds without being tapped. Nothing touches the mirror when the\r\nDecticus sings. Its vibrations are imparted to it after starting\r\nelsewhere. And how? I will tell you.\r\n\r\nIts edging is prolonged at the inner angle of the base by a wide, blunt\r\ntooth, furnished at the end with a more prominent and powerful fold\r\nthan the other nervures distributed here and there. I will call this\r\nfold the friction-nervure. This is the starting-point of the concussion\r\nthat makes the mirror resound. The evidence will appear when the\r\nremainder of the apparatus is known.\r\n\r\nThis remainder, the motor mechanism, is on the left wing-case, covering\r\nthe other with its flat edge. Outside, there is nothing remarkable,\r\nunless it be—and even then one has to be on the look-out for it—a sort\r\nof slightly slanting, transversal pad, which might very easily be taken\r\nfor a thicker nervure than the others.\r\n\r\nBut examine the lower surface through the magnifying-glass. The pad is\r\nmuch more than an ordinary nervure. It is an instrument of the highest\r\nprecision, a magnificent indented bow, marvellously regular on its\r\ndiminutive scale. Never did human industry, when cutting metal for the\r\nmost delicate clockwork mechanism, achieve such perfection. Its shape\r\nis that of a curved spindle. From one end to the other there have been\r\ncut across this bow about eighty triangular teeth, which are very even\r\nand are of some hard, durable material, dark-brown in colour.\r\n\r\nThe use of this mechanical gem is obvious. If we take a dead Decticus\r\nand lift the flat rim of the two wing-cases slightly in order to place\r\nthem in the position which they occupy when sounding, we see the bow\r\nfitting its indentations to the terminal nervure which I have called\r\nthe friction-nervure; we follow the line of teeth which, from end to\r\nend of the row, never swerve from the points to be set in motion; and,\r\nif the operation be done at all dexterously, the dead insect sings,\r\nthat is to say, strikes a few of its clicking notes.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the sounds produced by the Decticus is out. The toothed\r\nbow of the left wing-case is the motor; the friction-nervure of the\r\nright wing-case is the point of concussion; the stretched membrane of\r\nthe mirror is the resonator, to which vibration is communicated by the\r\nshaking of the surrounding frame. Our own music has many vibrating\r\nmembranes; but these are always affected by direct percussion. Bolder\r\nthan our makers of musical instruments, the Decticus combines the bow\r\nwith the drum.\r\n\r\nThe same combination is found in the other Grasshoppers. The most\r\nfamous of these is the Green Grasshopper (Locusta viridissima, Lin.),\r\nwho to the qualities of a handsome stature and a fine green colour adds\r\nthe honour of classical renown. In La Fontaine she is the Cicada who\r\ncomes alms-begging of the Ant when the north wind blows. Flies and\r\nGrubs being scarce, the would-be borrower asks for a few grains to live\r\nupon until next summer. The double diet, animal and vegetable, is a\r\nvery happy inspiration on the fabulist’s part.\r\n\r\nThe Grasshopper, in fact, has the same tastes as the Decticus. In my\r\ncages, he feeds on lettuce-leaves when there is nothing better going;\r\nbut his preference is all in favour of the Locust, whom he crunches up\r\nwithout leaving anything but the wing-cases and wings. In a state of\r\nliberty, his preying on that ravenous browser must largely make up to\r\nus for the small toll which he levies on our agricultural produce.\r\n\r\nExcept in a few details, his musical instrument is the same as that of\r\nthe Decticus. It occupies, at the base of the wing-cases, a large\r\nsunken surface shaped like a curved triangle and brownish in colour,\r\nwith a dull-yellow rim. It is a sort of escutcheon, emblazoned with\r\nheraldic devices. On the under surface of the left wing-case, which is\r\nfolded over the right, two transversal, parallel grooves are cut. The\r\nspace between them makes a ridge which constitutes the bow. The latter,\r\na brown spindle, has a set of fine, very regular and very numerous\r\nteeth. The mirror of the right wing-case is almost circular, well\r\nframed and supplied with a strong and prominent friction-nervure.\r\n\r\nThe insect stridulates in July and August, in the evening twilight,\r\nuntil close upon ten o’clock. It produces a quick, rattling noise,\r\naccompanied by a faint metallic clicking which barely passes the border\r\nof perceptible sounds. The abdomen, considerably lowered, throbs and\r\nbeats the measure. This goes on for irregular periods and suddenly\r\nceases; in between these periods there are false starts reduced to a\r\nfew strokes of the bow; there are pauses and then the stridulation is\r\nonce more in full swing.\r\n\r\nAll said, it is a very meagre performance, greatly inferior in volume\r\nto that of the Decticus, not to be compared with the song of the\r\nCricket and even less with the harsh and noisy efforts of the Cicada.\r\nIn the quiet of the evening, when only a few steps away, I need little\r\nPaul’s delicate ear to apprise me of it.\r\n\r\nIt is poorer still in the two dwarf Dectici of my neighbourhood,\r\nPlatycleis intermedia, Serv., and P. grisea, Fab., both of whom are\r\ncommon in the long grass, where the ground is stony and exposed to the\r\nsun, and quick to disappear in the undergrowth when you try to catch\r\nthem. These two fat songsters have each had the doubtful privilege of a\r\nplace in my cages.\r\n\r\nHere, in a blazing sun beating straight upon the window, are my little\r\nDectici crammed with green millet-seeds and also with game. Most of\r\nthem are lying in the hottest places, on their bellies or sides, with\r\ntheir hind-legs outstretched. For hours on end they digest without\r\nmoving and slumber in their voluptuous attitude. Some of them sing. Oh,\r\nwhat a feeble song!\r\n\r\nThe ditty of the Intermediary Decticus, with its strophes and pauses\r\nalternating at equal intervals, is a rapid fr-r-r-r similar to the\r\nCoaltit’s, while that of the Grey Decticus consists of distinct strokes\r\nof the bow and tends to copy the Cricket’s melody, with a note which is\r\nhoarser and, in particular, much fainter. In both cases, the feebleness\r\nof the sound hardly allows me to hear the singer a couple of yards\r\naway.\r\n\r\nAnd to produce this music, this insignificant and only just perceptible\r\nrefrain, the two dwarfs have all that their big cousin possesses: a\r\ntoothed bow, a tambourine, a friction-nervure. On the bow of the Grey\r\nDecticus I count about forty teeth and eighty on that of the\r\nIntermediary Decticus. Moreover, in both, the right wing-case displays,\r\naround the mirror, a few diaphanous spaces, intended no doubt to\r\nincrease the extent of the vibrating portion. It makes no difference:\r\nthough the instrument is magnificent, the production of sound is very\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nWith this same mechanism of a drum and file, which of them will achieve\r\nany progress? Not one of the large-winged Locustidæ succeeds in doing\r\nso. All, from the biggest, the Grasshoppers, Dectici and Conocephali,\r\ndown to the smallest, the Platycleis, Xiphidion and Phaneropteron, set\r\nin motion with the teeth of a bow the frame of a vibrating-mirror; all\r\nare, so to speak, left-handed, that is to say, they carry the bow on\r\nthe lower surface of the left wing-case, overlapping the right, which\r\nis furnished with the tympanum; all, lastly, have a thin, faint trill\r\nwhich is sometimes hardly perceptible.\r\n\r\nOne alone, modifying the details of the apparatus without introducing\r\nany innovation into the general structure, achieves a certain power of\r\nsound. This is the Vine Ephippiger, who does without wings and reduces\r\nhis wing-cases to two concave scales, elegantly fluted and fitting one\r\ninto the other. These two disks are all that remains of the organs of\r\nflight, which have become exclusively organs of song. The insect\r\nabandons flying to devote itself the better to stridulation.\r\n\r\nIt shelters its instrument under a sort of dome formed by the corselet,\r\nwhich is curved saddlewise. As usual, the left scale occupies the upper\r\nposition and bears on its lower surface a file in which we can\r\ndistinguish with the lens eighty transversal denticulations, more\r\npowerful and more clearly cut than those possessed by any other of the\r\nGrasshopper tribe. The right scale is underneath. At the top of its\r\nslightly flattened dome, the mirror gleams, framed in a strong nervure.\r\n\r\nFor elegance of structure, this instrument is superior to the Cicada’s,\r\nin which the contraction of two columns of muscles alternately pulls in\r\nand lets out the convex surface of two barren cymbals. It needs\r\nsound-chambers, resonators, to become a noisy apparatus. As things are,\r\nit emits a lingering and plaintive tchi-i-i, tchi-i-i, tchi-i-i, in a\r\nminor key, which is heard even farther than the blithe bowing of the\r\nWhite-faced Decticus.\r\n\r\nWhen disturbed in their repose, the Decticus and the other Grasshoppers\r\nat once become silent, struck dumb with fear. With them, singing\r\ninvariably expresses gladness. The Ephippiger also dreads to be\r\ndisturbed and baffles with his sudden silence whoso seeks to find him.\r\nBut take him between your fingers. Often he will resume his\r\nstridulation with erratic strokes of the bow. At such times the song\r\ndenotes anything but happiness, fear rather and all the anguish of\r\ndanger. The Cicada likewise rattles more shrilly than ever when a\r\nruthless child dislocates his abdomen and forces open his chapels. In\r\nboth cases, the gay refrain of the mirthful insect turns into the\r\nlamentation of a persecuted victim.\r\n\r\nA second peculiarity of the Ephippiger’s, unknown to the other singing\r\ninsects, is worthy of remark. Both sexes are endowed with the\r\nsound-producing apparatus. The female, who, in the other Grasshoppers,\r\nis always dumb, with not even a vestige of bow or mirror, acquires in\r\nthis instance a musical instrument which is a close copy of the male’s.\r\n\r\nThe left scale covers the right. Its edges are fluted with thick, pale\r\nnervures, forming a fine-meshed network; the centre, on the other hand,\r\nis smooth and swells into an amber-coloured dome. Underneath, this dome\r\nis supplied with two concurrent nervures, the chief of which is\r\nslightly wrinkled on its ridge. The right scale is similarly\r\nconstructed, but for one detail: the central dome, which also is\r\namber-coloured, is traversed by a nervure which describes a sort of\r\nsinuous line and which, under the magnifying-glass, reveals very fine\r\ntransversal teeth throughout the greater part of its length.\r\n\r\nThis feature betrays the bow, placed in the inverse position to that\r\nwhich is known to us. The male is left-handed and works with his upper\r\nwing-case; the female is right-handed and scrapes with her lower\r\nwing-case. Besides, with her, there is no such thing as a mirror, that\r\nis to say, no shiny membrane resembling a flake of mica. The bow rubs\r\nacross the rough vein of the opposite scale and in this way produces\r\nsimultaneous vibration in the two fitted spherical domes.\r\n\r\nThe vibrating part is double, therefore, but too stiff and clumsy to\r\nproduce a sound of any depth. The song, in any case rather thin, is\r\neven more plaintive than the male’s. The insect is not lavish with it.\r\nIf I do not interfere, my captives never add their note to the concert\r\nof their caged companions; on the other hand, when seized and worried,\r\nthey utter a moan at once. It seems likely that, in a state of liberty,\r\nthings happen otherwise. The dumb beauties in my bell-jars are not for\r\nnothing endowed with a double cymbal and a bow. The instrument that\r\nmoans with fright must also ring out joyously on occasion.\r\n\r\nWhat purpose is served by the Grasshopper’s sound-apparatus? I will not\r\ngo so far as to refuse it a part in the pairing, or to deny it a\r\npersuasive murmur, sweet to her who hears it: that would be flying in\r\nthe face of the evidence. But this is not its principal function.\r\nBefore anything else, the insect uses it to express its joy in living,\r\nto sing the delights of existence with a belly well filled and a back\r\nwarmed by the sun, as witness the big Decticus and the male\r\nGrasshopper, who, after the wedding, exhausted for good and all and\r\ntaking no further interest in pairing, continue to stridulate merrily\r\nas long as their strength holds out.\r\n\r\nThe Grasshopper tribe has its bursts of gladness; it has moreover the\r\nadvantage of being able to express them with a sound, the simple\r\nsatisfaction of the artist. The little journeyman whom I see in the\r\nevening returning from the workyard on his way home, where his supper\r\nawaits him, whistles and sings for his own pleasure, with no intention\r\nof making himself heard, nor any wish to attract an audience. In his\r\nartless and almost unconscious fashion, he tells the joys of a hard\r\nday’s work done and of his plateful of steaming cabbage. Even so most\r\noften does the singing insect stridulate: it is celebrating life.\r\n\r\nSome go farther. If existence has its sweets, it also has its sorrows.\r\nThe saddle-bearing Grasshopper of the vines is able to translate both\r\nof these into sound. In a trailing melody, he sings to the bushes of\r\nhis happiness; in a like melody, hardly altered, he pours forth his\r\ngriefs and his fears. His mate, herself an instrumentalist, shares this\r\nprivilege. She exults and laments with two cymbals of another pattern.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said, the cogged drum need not be looked down upon. It\r\nenlivens the lawns, murmurs the joys and tribulations of existence,\r\nsends the lover’s call echoing all around, brightens the weary waiting\r\nof the lonely ones, tells of the perfect blossoming of insect life. Its\r\nstroke of the bow is almost a voice.\r\n\r\nAnd this magnificent gift, so full of promise, is granted only to the\r\ninferior races, coarse natures, near akin to the crude beginnings of\r\nthe carboniferous period. If, as we are told, the superior insect\r\ndescends from ancestors who have been gradually transformed, why did it\r\nnot preserve that fine inheritance of a voice which has sounded from\r\nthe earliest ages?\r\n\r\nCan it be that the theory of progressive acquirements is only a\r\nspecious lure? Are we to abandon the savage theory of the crushing of\r\nthe weak by the strong, of the less well-endowed by their more\r\nhighly-gifted rivals? Is it permissible to doubt, when the\r\nevolutionists talk to us of the survival of the fittest? Yes, indeed it\r\nis!\r\n\r\nWe are told as much by a certain Libellula of the carboniferous age\r\n(Meganeura Monyi, Brong.), measuring over two feet across the wings.\r\nThe giant Dragon-fly, who terrified the small winged folk with her\r\nsawlike mandibles, has disappeared, whereas the puny Agrion, with her\r\nbronze or azure abdomen, still hovers over the reeds of our rivers.\r\n\r\nSo have her contemporaries disappeared, the monstrous sauroid fishes,\r\nmailed in enamel and armed to the teeth. Their scarce successors are\r\nmere abortions. The splendid series of Cephalopods with partitioned\r\nshells, including certain Ammonites of the diameter of a cartwheel, has\r\nno other representative in our present seas than that modest fireman’s\r\nhelmet, the Nautilus. The Megalosaurus, a saurian twenty-five yards\r\nlong, was a more alarming figure in our country-sides than the Grey\r\nLizard of the walls. One of man’s contemporaries, that monumental beast\r\nthe Mammoth, is known only by his remains; and his near kinsman the\r\nElephant, a mere Sheep beside him, goes on prospering. What a shock to\r\nthe law of the survival of the strongest! The mighty have gone under;\r\nand the weak fill their place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE GREEN GRASSHOPPER\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are in the middle of July. The astronomical dog-days are just\r\nbeginning; but in reality the torrid season has anticipated the\r\ncalendar and for some weeks past the heat has been overpowering.\r\n\r\nThis evening in the village they are celebrating the National Festival.\r\n[58] While the little boys and girls are hopping around a bonfire whose\r\ngleams are reflected upon the church-steeple, while the drum is pounded\r\nto mark the ascent of each rocket, I am sitting alone in a dark corner,\r\nin the comparative coolness that prevails at nine o’clock, harking to\r\nthe concert of the festival of the fields, the festival of the harvest,\r\ngrander by far than that which, at this moment, is being celebrated in\r\nthe village square with gun-powder, lighted torches, Chinese lanterns\r\nand, above all, strong drink. It has the simplicity of beauty and the\r\nrepose of strength.\r\n\r\nIt is late; and the Cicadæ are silent. Glutted with light and heat,\r\nthey have indulged in symphonies all the livelong day. The advent of\r\nthe night means rest for them, but a rest frequently disturbed. In the\r\ndense branches of the plane-trees, a sudden sound rings out like a cry\r\nof anguish, strident and short. It is the desperate wail of the Cicada,\r\nsurprised in his quietude by the Green Grasshopper, that ardent\r\nnocturnal huntress, who springs upon him, grips him in the side, opens\r\nand ransacks his abdomen. An orgy of music, followed by butchery.\r\n\r\nI have never seen and never shall see that supreme expression of our\r\nnational revelry, the military review at Longchamp; nor do I much\r\nregret it. The newspapers tell me as much about it as I want to know.\r\nThey give me a sketch of the site. I see, installed here and there amid\r\nthe trees, the ominous Red Cross, with the legend, “Military Ambulance;\r\nCivil Ambulance.” There will be bones broken, apparently; cases of\r\nsunstroke; regrettable deaths, perhaps. It is all provided for and all\r\nin the programme.\r\n\r\nEven here, in my village, usually so peaceable, the festival will not\r\nend, I am ready to wager, without the exchange of a few blows, that\r\ncompulsory seasoning of a day of merry-making. No pleasure, it appears,\r\ncan be fully relished without an added condiment of pain.\r\n\r\nLet us listen and meditate far from the tumult. While the disembowelled\r\nCicada utters his protest, the festival up there in the plane-trees is\r\ncontinued with a change of orchestra. It is now the time of the\r\nnocturnal performers. Hard by the place of slaughter, in the green\r\nbushes, a delicate ear perceives the hum of the Grasshoppers. It is the\r\nsort of noise that a spinning-wheel makes, a very unobtrusive sound, a\r\nvague rustle of dry membranes rubbed together. Above this dull bass\r\nthere rises, at intervals, a hurried, very shrill, almost metallic\r\nclicking. There you have the air and the recitative, intersected by\r\npauses. The rest is the accompaniment.\r\n\r\nDespite the assistance of a bass, it is a poor concert, very poor\r\nindeed, though there are about ten executants in my immediate vicinity.\r\nThe tone lacks intensity. My old tympanum is not always capable of\r\nperceiving these subtleties of sound. The little that reaches me is\r\nextremely sweet and most appropriate to the calm of twilight. Just a\r\nlittle more breadth in your bow-stroke, my dear Green Grasshopper, and\r\nyour technique would be better than the hoarse Cicada’s, whose name and\r\nreputation you have been made to usurp in the countries of the north.\r\n\r\nStill, you will never equal your neighbour, the little bell-ringing\r\nToad, who goes tinkling all round, at the foot of the plane-trees,\r\nwhile you click up above. He is the smallest of my batrachian folk and\r\nthe most venturesome in his expeditions.\r\n\r\nHow often, at nightfall, by the last glimmers of daylight, have I not\r\ncome upon him as I wandered through my garden, hunting for ideas!\r\nSomething runs away, rolling over and over in front of me. Is it a dead\r\nleaf blown along by the wind? No, it is the pretty little Toad\r\ndisturbed in the midst of his pilgrimage. He hurriedly takes shelter\r\nunder a stone, a clod of earth, a tuft of grass, recovers from his\r\nexcitement and loses no time in picking up his liquid note.\r\n\r\nOn this evening of national rejoicing, there are nearly a dozen of him\r\ntinkling against one another around me. Most of them are crouching\r\namong the rows of flower-pots that form a sort of lobby outside my\r\nhouse. Each has his own note, always the same, lower in one case,\r\nhigher in another, a short, clear note, melodious and of exquisite\r\npurity.\r\n\r\nWith their slow, rhythmical cadence, they seem to be intoning litanies.\r\nCluck, says one; click, responds another, on a finer note; clock, adds\r\na third, the tenor of the band. And this is repeated indefinitely, like\r\nthe bells of the village pealing on a holiday: cluck, click, clock;\r\ncluck, click, clock!\r\n\r\nThe batrachian choristers remind me of a certain harmonica which I used\r\nto covet when my six-year-old ear began to awaken to the magic of\r\nsounds. It consisted of a series of strips of glass of unequal length,\r\nhung on two stretched tapes. A cork fixed to a wire served as a hammer.\r\nImagine an unskilled hand striking at random on this key-board, with a\r\nsudden clash of octaves, dissonances and topsy-turvy chords; and you\r\nwill have a pretty clear idea of the Toads’ litany.\r\n\r\nAs a song, this litany has neither head nor tail to it; as a collection\r\nof pure sounds, it is delicious. This is the case with all the music in\r\nnature’s concerts. Our ear discovers superb notes in it and then\r\nbecomes refined and acquires, outside the realities of sound, that\r\nsense of order which is the first condition of beauty.\r\n\r\nNow this sweet ringing of bells between hiding-place and hiding-place\r\nis the matrimonial oratorio, the discreet summons which every Jack\r\nissues to his Jill. The sequel to the concert may be guessed without\r\nfurther enquiry; but what it would be impossible to foresee is the\r\nstrange finale of the wedding. Behold the father, in this case a real\r\npater-familias, in the noblest sense of the word, coming out of his\r\nretreat one day in an unrecognizable state. He is carrying the future,\r\ntight-packed around his hind-legs; he is changing houses laden with a\r\ncluster of eggs the size of pepper-corns. His calves are girt, his\r\nthighs are sheathed with the bulky burden; and it covers his back like\r\na beggar’s wallet, completely deforming him.\r\n\r\nWhither is he going, dragging himself along, incapable of jumping,\r\nthanks to the weight of his load? He is going, the fond parent, where\r\nthe mother refuses to go; he is on his way to the nearest pond, whose\r\nwarm waters are indispensable to the tadpoles’ hatching and existence.\r\nWhen the eggs are nicely ripened around his legs under the humid\r\nshelter of a stone, he braves the damp and the daylight, he the\r\npassionate lover of dry land and darkness; he advances by short stages,\r\nhis lungs congested with fatigue. The pond is far away, perhaps; no\r\nmatter: the plucky pilgrim will find it.\r\n\r\nHe’s there. Without delay, he dives, despite his profound antipathy to\r\nbathing; and the cluster of eggs is instantly removed by the legs\r\nrubbing against each other. The eggs are now in their element; and the\r\nrest will be accomplished of itself. Having fulfilled his obligation to\r\ngo right under, the father hastens to return to his well-sheltered\r\nhome. He is scarcely out of sight before the little black tadpoles are\r\nhatched and playing about. They were but waiting for the contact of the\r\nwater in order to burst their shells.\r\n\r\nAmong the singers in the July gloaming, one alone, were he able to vary\r\nhis notes, could vie with the Toad’s harmonious bells. This is the\r\nlittle Scops-owl, that comely nocturnal bird of prey, with the round\r\ngold eyes. He sports on his forehead two small feathered horns which\r\nhave won for him in the district the name of Machoto banarudo, the\r\nHorned Owl. His song, which is rich enough to fill by itself the still\r\nnight air, is of a nerve-shattering monotony. With imperturbable and\r\nmeasured regularity, for hours on end, kew, kew, the bird spits out its\r\ncantata to the moon.\r\n\r\nOne of them has arrived at this moment, driven from the plane-trees in\r\nthe square by the din of the rejoicings, to demand my hospitality. I\r\ncan hear him in the top of a cypress near by. From up there, dominating\r\nthe lyrical assembly, at regular intervals he cuts into the vague\r\norchestration of the Grasshoppers and the Toads.\r\n\r\nHis soft note is contrasted, intermittently, with a sort of Cat’s mew,\r\ncoming from another spot. This is the call of the Common Owl, the\r\nmeditative bird of Minerva. After hiding all day in the seclusion of a\r\nhollow olive-tree, he started on his wanderings when the shades of\r\nevening began to fall. Swinging along with a sinuous flight, he came\r\nfrom somewhere in the neighbourhood to the pines in my enclosure,\r\nwhence he mingles his harsh mewing, slightly softened by distance, with\r\nthe general concert.\r\n\r\nThe Green Grasshopper’s clicking is too faint to be clearly perceived\r\namidst these clamourers; all that reaches me is the least ripple, just\r\nnoticeable when there is a moment’s silence. He possesses as his\r\napparatus of sound only a modest drum and scraper, whereas they, more\r\nhighly privileged, have their bellows, the lungs, which send forth a\r\ncolumn of vibrating air. There is no comparison possible. Let us return\r\nto the insects.\r\n\r\nOne of these, though inferior in size and no less sparingly equipped,\r\ngreatly surpasses the Grasshopper in nocturnal rhapsodies. I speak of\r\nthe pale and slender Italian Cricket (Œcanthus pellucens, Scop.), who\r\nis so puny that you dare not take him up for fear of crushing him. He\r\nmakes music everywhere among the rosemary-bushes, while the Glow-worms\r\nlight up their blue lamps to complete the revels. The delicate\r\ninstrumentalist consists chiefly of a pair of large wings, thin and\r\ngleaming as strips of mica. Thanks to these dry sails, he fiddles away\r\nwith an intensity capable of drowning the Toads’ fugue. His performance\r\nsuggests, but with more brilliancy, more tremolo in the execution, the\r\nsong of the Common Black Cricket. Indeed the mistake would certainly be\r\nmade by any one who did not know that, by the time that the very hot\r\nweather comes, the true Cricket, the chorister of spring, has\r\ndisappeared. His pleasant violin has been succeeded by another more\r\npleasant still and worthy of special study. We shall return to him at\r\nan opportune moment.\r\n\r\nThese then, limiting ourselves to select specimens, are the principal\r\nparticipants in this musical evening: the Scops-owl, with his\r\nlanguorous solos; the Toad, that tinkler of sonatas; the Italian\r\nCricket, who scrapes the first string of a violin; and the Green\r\nGrasshopper, who seems to beat a tiny steel triangle.\r\n\r\nWe are celebrating to-day, with greater uproar than conviction, the new\r\nera, dating politically from the fall of the Bastille; they, with\r\nglorious indifference to human things, are celebrating the festival of\r\nthe sun, singing the happiness of existence, sounding the loud hosanna\r\nof the July heats.\r\n\r\nWhat care they for man and his fickle rejoicings! For whom or for what\r\nwill our squibs be spluttering a few years hence? Far-seeing indeed\r\nwould he be who could answer the question. Fashions change and bring us\r\nthe unexpected. The time-serving rocket spreads its sheaf of sparks for\r\nthe public enemy of yesterday, who has become the idol of to-day.\r\nTo-morrow it will go up for somebody else.\r\n\r\nIn a century or two, will any one, outside the historians, give a\r\nthought to the taking of the Bastille? It is very doubtful. We shall\r\nhave other joys and also other cares.\r\n\r\nLet us look a little farther ahead. A day will come, so everything\r\nseems to tell us, when, after making progress upon progress, man will\r\nsuccumb, destroyed by the excess of what he calls civilization. Too\r\neager to play the god, he cannot hope for the animal’s placid\r\nlongevity; he will have disappeared when the little Toad is still\r\nsaying his litany, in company with the Grasshopper, the Scops-owl and\r\nthe others. They were singing on this planet before us; they will sing\r\nafter us, celebrating what can never change, the fiery glory of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nI will dwell no longer on this festival and will become once more the\r\nnaturalist, anxious to obtain information concerning the private life\r\nof the insect. The Green Grasshopper (Locusta viridissima, Lin.) does\r\nnot appear to be common in my neighbourhood. Last year, intending to\r\nmake a study of this insect and finding my efforts to hunt it\r\nfruitless, I was obliged to have recourse to the good offices of a\r\nforest-ranger, who sent me a pair of couples from the Lagarde plateau,\r\nthat bleak district where the beech-tree begins its escalade of the\r\nVentoux.\r\n\r\nNow and then freakish fortune takes it into her head to smile upon the\r\npersevering. What was not to be found last year has become almost\r\ncommon this summer. Without leaving my narrow enclosure, I obtain as\r\nmany Grasshoppers as I could wish. I hear them rustling at night in the\r\ngreen thickets. Let us make the most of the windfall, which perhaps\r\nwill not occur again.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June, my treasures are installed, in a sufficient\r\nnumber of couples, under a wire cover standing on a bed of sand in an\r\nearthen pan. It is indeed a magnificent insect, pale-green all over,\r\nwith two whitish stripes running down its sides. Its imposing size, its\r\nslim proportions and its great gauze wings make it the most elegant of\r\nour Locustidæ. I am enraptured with my captives. What will they teach\r\nme? We shall see. For the moment, we must feed them.\r\n\r\nI have here the same difficulty that I had with the Decticus.\r\nInfluenced by the general diet of the Orthoptera, [59] those ruminants\r\nof the greenswards, I offer the prisoners a leaf of lettuce. They bite\r\ninto it, certainly, but very sparingly and with a scornful tooth. It\r\nsoon becomes plain that I am dealing with half-hearted vegetarians.\r\nThey want something else: they are beasts of prey, apparently. But what\r\nmanner of prey? A lucky chance taught me.\r\n\r\nAt break of day I was pacing up and down outside my door, when\r\nsomething fell from the nearest plane-tree with a shrill grating sound.\r\nI ran up and saw a Grasshopper gutting the belly of an exhausted\r\nCicada. In vain the victim buzzed and waved his limbs: the other did\r\nnot let go, dipping her head right into the entrails and rooting them\r\nout by small mouthfuls.\r\n\r\nI knew what I wanted to know: the attack had taken place up above,\r\nearly in the morning, while the Cicada was asleep; and the plunging of\r\nthe poor wretch, dissected alive, had made assailant and assailed fall\r\nin a bundle to the ground. Since then I have repeatedly had occasion to\r\nwitness similar carnage.\r\n\r\nI have even seen the Grasshopper—the height of audacity, this—dart in\r\npursuit of a Cicada in mad flight. Even so does the Sparrow-hawk pursue\r\nthe Swallow in the sky. But the bird of prey here is inferior to the\r\ninsect. It attacks a weaker than itself. The Grasshopper, on the other\r\nhand, assaults a colossus, much larger than herself and stronger; and\r\nnevertheless the result of the unequal fight is not in doubt. The\r\nGrasshopper rarely fails with the sharp pliers of her powerful jaws to\r\ndisembowel her capture, which, being unprovided with weapons, confines\r\nitself to crying out and kicking.\r\n\r\nThe main thing is to retain one’s hold of the prize, which is not\r\ndifficult in somnolent darkness. Any Cicada encountered by the fierce\r\nLocustid on her nocturnal rounds is bound to die a lamentable death.\r\nThis explains those sudden agonized notes which grate through the woods\r\nat late, unseasonable hours, when the cymbals have long been silent.\r\nThe murderess in her suit of apple-green has pounced on some sleeping\r\nCicada.\r\n\r\nMy boarders’ menu is settled: I will feed them on Cicadæ. They take\r\nsuch a liking to this fare that, in two or three weeks, the floor of\r\nthe cage is a knacker’s yard strewn with heads and empty thoraces, with\r\ntorn-off wings and disjointed legs. The belly alone disappears almost\r\nentirely. This is the tit-bit, not very substantial, but extremely\r\ntasty, it would seem. Here, in fact, in the insect’s crop, the syrup is\r\naccumulated, the sugary sap which the Cicada’s gimlet taps from the\r\ntender bark. Is it because of this dainty that the prey’s abdomen is\r\npreferred to any other morsel? It is quite possible.\r\n\r\nI do, in fact, with a view to varying the diet, decide to serve up some\r\nvery sweet fruits, slices of pear, grape-pips, bits of melon. All this\r\nmeets with delighted appreciation. The Green Grasshopper resembles the\r\nEnglish: she dotes on underdone rumpsteak seasoned with jam. [60] This\r\nperhaps is why, on catching the Cicada, she first rips up his paunch,\r\nwhich supplies a mixture of flesh and preserves.\r\n\r\nTo eat Cicadæ and sugar is not possible in every part of the country.\r\nIn the north, where she abounds, the Green Grasshopper would not find\r\nthe dish which attracts her so strongly here. She must have other\r\nresources. To convince myself of this, I give her Anoxiæ (A. pilosa,\r\nFab.), the summer equivalent of the spring Cockchafer. The Beetle is\r\naccepted without hesitation. Nothing is left of him but the wing-cases,\r\nhead and legs. The result is the same with the magnificent plump Pine\r\nCockchafer (Melolontha fullo, Lin.), a sumptuous morsel which I find\r\nnext day eviscerated by my gang of knackers.\r\n\r\nThese examples teach us enough. They tell us that the Grasshopper is an\r\ninveterate consumer of insects, especially of those which are not\r\nprotected by too hard a cuirass; they are evidence of tastes which are\r\nhighly carnivorous, but not exclusively so, like those of the Praying\r\nMantis, who refuses everything except game. The butcher of the Cicadæ\r\nis able to modify an excessively heating diet with vegetable fare.\r\nAfter meat and blood, sugary fruit-pulp; sometimes even, for lack of\r\nanything better, a little green stuff.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, cannibalism is prevalent. True, I never witness in my\r\nGrasshopper-cages the savagery which is so common in the Praying\r\nMantis, who harpoons her rivals and devours her lovers; but, if some\r\nweakling succumb, the survivors hardly ever fail to profit by his\r\ncarcass as they would in the case of any ordinary prey. With no\r\nscarcity of provisions as an excuse, they feast upon their defunct\r\ncompanion. For the rest, all the sabre-bearing clan display, in varying\r\ndegrees, a propensity for filling their bellies with their maimed\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nIn other respects, the Grasshoppers live together very peacefully in my\r\ncages. No serious strife ever takes place among them, nothing beyond a\r\nlittle rivalry in the matter of food. I hand in a piece of pear. A\r\nGrasshopper alights on it at once. Jealously she kicks away any one\r\ntrying to bite at the delicious morsel. Selfishness reigns everywhere.\r\nWhen she has eaten her fill, she makes way for another, who in her turn\r\nbecomes intolerant. One after the other, all the inmates of the\r\nmenagerie come and refresh themselves. After cramming their crops, they\r\nscratch the soles of their feet a little with their mandibles, polish\r\nup their forehead and eyes with a leg moistened with spittle and then,\r\nhanging to the trelliswork or lying on the sand in a posture of\r\ncontemplation, blissfully they digest and slumber most of the day,\r\nespecially during the hottest part of it.\r\n\r\nIt is in the evening, after sunset, that the troop becomes lively. By\r\nnine o’clock the animation is at its height. With sudden rushes they\r\nclamber to the top of the dome, to descend as hurriedly and climb up\r\nonce more. They come and go tumultuously, run and hop around the\r\ncircular track and, without stopping, nibble at the good things on the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe males are stridulating by themselves, here and there, teasing the\r\npassing fair with their antennæ. The future mothers stroll about\r\ngravely, with their sabre half-raised. The agitation and feverish\r\nexcitement means that the great business of pairing is at hand. The\r\nfact will escape no practised eye.\r\n\r\nIt is also what I particularly wish to observe. My chief object in\r\nstocking my cages was to discover how far the strange nuptial manners\r\nrevealed by the White-faced Decticus might be regarded as general. My\r\nwish is satisfied, but not fully, for the late hours at which events\r\ntake place did not allow me to witness the final act of the wedding. It\r\nis late at night or early in the morning that things happen.\r\n\r\nThe little that I see is confined to interminable preludes. Standing\r\nface to face, with foreheads almost touching, the lovers feel and sound\r\neach other for a long time with their limp antennæ. They suggest two\r\nfencers crossing and recrossing harmless foils. From time to time, the\r\nmale stridulates a little, gives a few short strokes of the bow and\r\nthen falls silent, feeling perhaps too much overcome to continue.\r\nEleven o’clock strikes; and the declaration is not yet over. Very\r\nregretfully, but conquered by sleepiness, I quit the couple.\r\n\r\nNext morning, early, the female carries, hanging at the bottom of her\r\novipositor, the queer bladderlike arrangement that surprised us so much\r\nin the Decticus. It is an opaline capsule, the size of a large pea and\r\nroughly subdivided into a small number of egg-shaped vesicles. When the\r\nGrasshopper walks, the thing scrapes along the ground and becomes dirty\r\nwith sticky grains of sand.\r\n\r\nThe final banquet of the female Decticus is seen again here in all its\r\nhideousness. When, after a couple of hours, the fertilizing capsule is\r\ndrained of its contents, the Grasshopper devours it bit by bit; for a\r\nlong time she chews and rechews the gummy morsel and ends by swallowing\r\nit all down. In less than half a day, the milky burden has disappeared,\r\nconsumed with zest down to the last atom.\r\n\r\nThe inconceivable therefore, imported, one would think, from another\r\nplanet, so far removed is it from earthly habits, reappears with no\r\nnoticeable variation in the Grasshopper, following on the Decticus.\r\nWhat singular folk are the Locustidæ, one of the oldest races in the\r\nanimal kingdom on dry land! It seems probable that these eccentricities\r\nare the rule throughout the order. Let us consult another sabre-bearer.\r\n\r\nI select the Ephippiger (Ephippigera vitium, Serv.), who is so easy to\r\nrear on bits of pear and lettuce-leaves. It is in July and August that\r\nthings happen. A little way off, the male is stridulating by himself.\r\nHis ardent bow-strokes set his whole body quivering. Then he stops.\r\nLittle by little, with slow and almost ceremonious steps, the caller\r\nand the called come closer together. They stand face to face, both\r\nsilent, both stationary, their antennæ gently swaying, their fore-legs\r\nraised awkwardly and giving a sort of handshake at intervals. The\r\npeaceful interview lasts for hours. What do they say to each other?\r\nWhat vows do they exchange? What does their ogling mean?\r\n\r\nBut the moment has not yet come. They separate, they fall out and each\r\ngoes his own way. The coolness does not last long. Here they are\r\ntogether again. The tender declarations are resumed, with no more\r\nsuccess than before. At last, on the third day, I behold the end of the\r\npreliminaries. The male slips discreetly under his companion,\r\nbackwards, according to the immemorial laws and customs of the\r\nCrickets. Stretched out behind and lying on his back, he clings to the\r\novipositor, his prop. The pairing is accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe result is an enormous spermatophore, a sort of opalescent raspberry\r\nwith large seeds. Its colour and shape remind one of a cluster of\r\nSnail’s-eggs. I remember seeing the same effect once with a Decticus,\r\nbut in a less striking form; and I find it again in the Green\r\nGrasshopper’s spermatophore. A thin median groove divides the whole\r\ninto two symmetrical bunches, each comprising seven or eight spherules.\r\nThe two nodes situated right and left of the bottom of the ovipositor\r\nare more transparent than the others and contain a bright orange-red\r\nkernel. The whole thing is attached by a wide pedicle, a dab of sticky\r\njelly.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the thing is placed in position, the shrunken male flees and\r\ngoes to recruit, after his disastrous prowess, on a slice of pear. The\r\nother, not at all troubled in spite of her heavy load, wanders about on\r\nthe trelliswork of the cage, taking very short steps as she slightly\r\nraises her raspberry, this enormous burden, equal in bulk to half the\r\ncreature’s abdomen.\r\n\r\nTwo or three hours pass in this way. Then the Ephippiger curves herself\r\ninto a ring and with her mandibles picks off particles of the nippled\r\ncapsule, without bursting it, of course, or allowing the contents to\r\nflow forth. She strips its surface by removing tiny shreds, which she\r\nchews in a leisurely fashion and swallows. This fastidious consuming by\r\natoms is continued for a whole afternoon. Next day the raspberry has\r\ndisappeared; the whole of it has been gulped down during the night.\r\n\r\nAt other times the end is less quick and, above all, less repulsive. I\r\nhave kept a note of an Ephippiger who was dragging her satchel along\r\nthe ground and nibbling at it from time to time. The soil is uneven and\r\nrugged, having been recently turned over with the blade of a knife. The\r\nraspberry-like capsule picks up grains of sand and little clods of\r\nearth, which increase the weight of the load considerably, though the\r\ninsect appears to pay no heed to it. Sometimes the carting becomes\r\nlaborious, because the load sticks to some bit of earth that refuses to\r\nmove. In spite of the efforts made to release the thing, it does not\r\nbecome detached from the point where it hangs under the ovipositor,\r\nthus proving that it possesses no small power of adhesion.\r\n\r\nAll through the evening, the Ephippiger roams about aimlessly, now on\r\nthe wirework, anon on the ground, wearing a preoccupied air. Oftener\r\nstill she stands without moving. The capsule withers a little, but does\r\nnot decrease notably in volume. There are no more of those mouthfuls\r\nwhich the Ephippiger snatched at the beginning; and the little that has\r\nalready been removed affects only the surface.\r\n\r\nNext day, things are as they were. There is nothing new, nor on the\r\nmorrow either, save that the capsule withers still more, though its two\r\nred dots remain almost as bright as at first. Finally, after sticking\r\non for forty-eight hours, the whole thing comes off without the\r\ninsect’s intervention.\r\n\r\nThe capsule has yielded its contents. It is a dried-up wreck,\r\nshrivelled beyond recognition, left lying in the gutter and doomed\r\nsooner or later to become the booty of the Ants. Why is it thus\r\nabandoned when, in other cases, I have seen the Ephippiger so greedy\r\nfor the morsel? Perhaps because the nuptial dish had become too gritty\r\nwith grains of sand, so unpleasant to the teeth.\r\n\r\nAnother Locustid, the Phaneroptera who carries a short yataghan bent\r\ninto a reaping-hook (P. falcata, Scop.), has made up to me in part for\r\nmy stud troubles. Repeatedly, but always under conditions which did not\r\nallow of completing my observation, I have caught her carrying the\r\nfertilizing-concern under the base of her sabre. It is a diaphanous,\r\noval phial, measuring three or four millimetres [61] and hanging from a\r\ncrystal thread, a neck almost as long as the distended part. The insect\r\ndoes not touch it, but leaves the phial to dry up and shrivel where it\r\nis. [62]\r\n\r\nLet us be content with this. These five examples, furnished by such\r\ndifferent genera, Decticus, Analota, Grasshopper, Ephippiger and\r\nPhaneroptera, prove that the Locustid, like the Scolopendra and the\r\nCephalopod, is a belated representative of the manners of antiquity, a\r\nvaluable specimen of the genetic eccentricities of olden times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE CRICKET: THE BURROW; THE EGG\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost as famous as the Cicada, the Field Cricket, the denizen of the\r\ngreenswards, figures among the limited but glorious number of the\r\nclassic insects. He owes this honour to his song and his house. One\r\nthing alone is lacking to complete his renown. By a regrettable\r\nomission, the master of the art of making animals talk gives him hardly\r\ntwo lines.\r\n\r\nIn one of his fables he shows us the Hare seized with terror at the\r\nsight of his ears, which scandalmongers will not fail to describe as\r\nhorns at a time when to be horned is dangerous. The prudent animal\r\npacks up his traps and makes off:\r\n\r\n\r\n       “Adieu, voisin Grillon,” dit-il; “je pars d’ici;\r\n        Mes oreilles enfin seraient cornes aussi.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cricket answers:\r\n\r\n\r\n       “Cornes cela! Vous me prenez pour cruche!\r\n        Ce sont oreilles que Dieu fit.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hare insists:\r\n\r\n\r\n       “On les fera passer pour cornes.” [63]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd that is all. What a pity that La Fontaine did not make the insect\r\nhold forth at greater length! The good-natured Cricket is depicted for\r\nus in a couple of lines which already show the master’s touch. No,\r\nindeed, he is no fool: his big head might have found some capital\r\nthings to say. And yet the Hare was perhaps not wrong to take his\r\ndeparture in a hurry. When slander is at your heels, the best thing is\r\nto fly.\r\n\r\nFlorian [64] was less concise in his story, which is on another theme;\r\nbut what a long way we are from the warmth and vigour of old La\r\nFontaine! In Florian’s fable Le Grillon, there are plenty of flowery\r\nmeadows and blue skies; Dame Nature and affectation go hand in hand; in\r\nshort, we have the feeble artificialities of a lifeless rhetoric, which\r\nloses sight of the thing described for the sake of the description. It\r\nlacks the simplicity of truth and also the saving salt of humour.\r\n\r\nBesides, what a preposterous idea, to represent the Cricket as\r\ndiscontented, bewailing his condition in despair! All who have studied\r\nhim know, on the contrary, that he is very well pleased with his own\r\ntalent and his hole. This, moreover, is what the fabulist makes him\r\nadmit, after the Butterfly’s discomfiture:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI find more force and more truth in the apologue by the nameless friend\r\nto whom I owe the Provençal piece, La Cigalo e la Fournigo. He will\r\nforgive me if for the second time I expose him, without his consent, to\r\nthe dangerous honour of print. Here it is:\r\n\r\n\r\n            LE GRILLON\r\n\r\n            L’histoire des bêtes rapporte\r\n            Qu’autrefois un pauvre grillon,\r\n            Prenant le soleil sur sa porte,\r\n            Vit passer un beau papillon.\r\n\r\n            Un papillon à longues queues,\r\n            Superbe, des mieux décorés,\r\n            Avec rangs de lunules bleues,\r\n            Galons noirs et gros points dorés. [66]\r\n\r\n            “Vole, vole,” lui dit l’ermite,\r\n            “Sur les fleurs, du matin au soir;\r\n            Ta rose, ni ta marguerite\r\n            Ne valent mon humble manoir.”\r\n\r\n            Il disait vrai. Vient un orage\r\n            Et le papillon est noyé\r\n            Dans un bourbier; la fange outrage\r\n            Le velours de son corps broyé.\r\n\r\n            Mais la tourmente en rien n’étonne\r\n            Le grillon, qui, dans son abri,\r\n            Qu’il pleuve, qu’il vente, qu’il tonne,\r\n            Vit tranquille et chante cri-cri.\r\n\r\n            Ah! n’allons pas courir le monde\r\n            Parmi les plaisirs et les fleurs;\r\n            L’humble foyer, sa paix profonde\r\n            Nous épargneront bien des pleurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE CRICKET\r\n\r\n            Among the beasts a tale is told\r\n              How a poor Cricket ventured nigh\r\n            His door to catch the sun’s warm gold\r\n              And saw a radiant Butterfly.\r\n\r\n            She passed with tails thrown proudly back\r\n              And long gay rows of crescents blue,\r\n            Brave yellow stars and bands of black,\r\n              The lordliest fly that ever flew.\r\n\r\n            “Ah, fly away,” the hermit said,\r\n              “Daylong among your flowers to roam;\r\n            Nor daisies white nor roses red\r\n              Will compensate my lowly home.”\r\n\r\n            True, all too true! There came a storm\r\n              And caught the other in its flood,\r\n            Staining her broken velvet form\r\n              And covering her wings with mud.\r\n\r\n            The Cricket, sheltered from the rain,\r\n              Chirped and looked on with tranquil eye;\r\n            For him the thunder pealed in vain,\r\n              The gale and torrent passed him by.\r\n\r\n            Then shun the world, nor take your fill\r\n              Of any of its joys or flowers;\r\n            A lowly fire-side, calm and still,\r\n              At least will grant you tearless hours! [67]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere I recognize my Cricket. I see him curling his antennæ on the\r\nthreshold of his burrow, keeping his belly cool and his back to the\r\nsun. He is not jealous of the Butterfly; on the contrary, he pities\r\nher, with that air of mocking commiseration familiar in the ratepayer\r\nwho owns a house of his own and sees passing before his door some\r\nwearer of a gaudy costume with no place to lay her head. Far from\r\ncomplaining, he is very well satisfied with both his house and his\r\nviolin. A true philosopher, he knows the vanity of things and\r\nappreciates the charm of a modest retreat away from the riot of\r\npleasure-seekers.\r\n\r\nYes, the description is about right, though it remains very inadequate\r\nand does not bear the stamp of immortality. The Cricket is still\r\nwaiting for the few lines needed to perpetuate his merits; and, since\r\nLa Fontaine neglected him, he will have to go on waiting a long time.\r\n\r\nTo me, as a naturalist, the outstanding feature in the two fables—a\r\nfeature which I should find repeated elsewhere, beyond a doubt, if my\r\nlibrary were not reduced to a small row of odd volumes on a deal\r\nshelf—is the burrow on which the moral is founded. Florian speaks of\r\nthe snug retreat; the other praises his lowly home. It is the dwelling\r\ntherefore that above all compels attention, even that of the poet, who\r\ncares little in general for realities.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, indeed, the Cricket is extraordinary. Of all our\r\ninsects, he alone, on attaining maturity, possesses a fixed abode, the\r\nmonument of his industry. During the bad season of the year, most of\r\nthe others burrow or skulk in some temporary refuge, a refuge obtained\r\nfree of cost and abandoned without regret. Several create marvels, with\r\na view to settling their family: cotton satchels, baskets made of\r\nleaves, towers of cement. Some carnivorous larvæ dwell in permanent\r\nambuscades, where they lie in wait for their prey. The Tiger-beetle,\r\namong others, digs itself a perpendicular hole, which it closes with\r\nits flat, bronze head. Whoever ventures on the insidious foot-bridge\r\nvanishes down the gulf, whose trap-door at once tips up and disappears\r\nbeneath the feet of the wayfarer. The Ant-lion makes a funnel in the\r\nsand. The Ant slides down its very loose slope and is bombarded with\r\nprojectiles hurled from the bottom of the crater by the hunter, who\r\nturns his neck into a catapult. But these are all temporary refuges,\r\nnests or traps.\r\n\r\nThe laboriously constructed residence, in which the insect settles down\r\nwith no intention of moving, either in the happy spring or the woful\r\nwinter season; the real manor, built for peace and comfort and not as a\r\nhunting-box or a nursery: this is known to the Cricket alone. On some\r\nsunny, grassy slope he is the owner of a hermitage. While all the\r\nothers lead vagabond lives, sleeping in the open air or under the\r\ncasual shelter of a dead leaf, a stone, or the peeling bark of an old\r\ntree, he is a privileged person with a permanent address.\r\n\r\nA serious problem is that of the home. It has been solved by the\r\nCricket, by the Rabbit and, lastly, by man. In my neighbourhood, the\r\nFox and the Badger have holes the best part of which is supplied by the\r\nirregularities of the rock. A few repairs; and the dug-out is\r\ncompleted. Cleverer than they, the Rabbit builds his house by burrowing\r\nwheresoever he pleases, when there is no natural passage that allows\r\nhim to settle down free of any trouble.\r\n\r\nThe Cricket surpasses all of them. Scorning chance refuges, he always\r\nchooses the site of his abode, in well-drained ground, with a pleasant\r\nsunny aspect. He refuses to make use of fortuitous cavities, which are\r\nincommodious and rough; he digs every bit of his villa, from the\r\nentrance-hall to the back-room.\r\n\r\nI see no one above him, in the art of house-building, except man; and\r\neven man, before mixing mortar to hold stones together, before kneading\r\nclay to coat his hut of branches, fought with wild beasts for the\r\npossession of a refuge in the rocks or an underground cavern.\r\n\r\nThen how are the privileges of instinct distributed? Here is one of the\r\nhumblest, able to lodge himself to perfection. He has a home, an\r\nadvantage unknown to many civilized beings; he has a peaceful retreat,\r\nthe first condition of comfort; and nobody around him is capable of\r\nsettling down. He has no rivals until you come to ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhence does he derive this gift? Is he favoured with special tools? No,\r\nthe Cricket is not an incomparable excavator; in fact, one is rather\r\nsurprised at the result when one considers the feebleness of his\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nCan it be made necessary by the demands of an exceptionally delicate\r\nskin? No, among his near kinsmen, other skins, no less sensitive than\r\nhis, do not dread the open air at all.\r\n\r\nCan it be a propensity inherent in the anatomical structure, a talent\r\nprescribed by the secret promptings of the organism? No, my\r\nneighbourhood boasts three other Crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus, de\r\nGeer; G. desertus, Pallas.; G. burdigalensis, Latr.), who are so like\r\nthe Field Cricket in appearance, colour and structure that, at the\r\nfirst glance, one would take them for him. The first is as large as he\r\nis, or even larger. The second represents him reduced to about half his\r\nsize. The third is smaller still. Well, of these faithful copies, these\r\ndoubles of the Field Cricket, not one knows how to dig himself a\r\nburrow. The Double-spotted Cricket inhabits those heaps of grass left\r\nto rot in damp places; the Solitary Cricket roams about the crevices in\r\nthe dry clods turned up by the gardener’s spade; the Bordeaux Cricket\r\nis not afraid to make his way into our houses, where he sings\r\ndiscreetly, during August and September, in some dark, cool spot.\r\n\r\nThere is no object in continuing our questions: each would meet with no\r\nfor an answer. Instinct, which stands revealed here and disappears\r\nthere despite organisms alike in all respects, will never tell us its\r\ncauses. It depends so little on an insect’s stock of tools that no\r\nanatomical detail can explain it to us and still less make us foresee\r\nit. The four almost identical Crickets, of whom one alone understands\r\nthe art of burrowing, add their evidence to the manifold proofs already\r\nsupplied; they confirm in a striking fashion our profound ignorance of\r\nthe origin of instinct.\r\n\r\nWho does not know the Cricket’s abode! Who has not, as a child playing\r\nin the fields, stopped in front of the hermit’s cabin! However light\r\nyour footfall, he has heard you coming and has abruptly withdrawn to\r\nthe very bottom of his hiding-place. When you arrive, the threshold of\r\nthe house is deserted.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows the way to bring the skulker out. You insert a straw\r\nand move it gently about the burrow. Surprised at what is happening\r\nabove, tickled and teased, the Cricket ascends from his secret\r\napartment; he stops in the passage, hesitates and enquires into things\r\nby waving his delicate antennæ; he comes to the light and, once\r\noutside, he is easy to catch, so greatly have events puzzled his poor\r\nhead. Should he be missed at the first attempt, he may become more\r\nsuspicious and obstinately resist the titillation of the straw. In that\r\ncase, we can flood him out with a glass of water.\r\n\r\nO those adorable times when we used to cage our Crickets and feed them\r\non a leaf of lettuce, those childish hunting-trips along the grassy\r\npaths! They all come back to me to-day, as I explore the burrows in\r\nsearch of subjects for my studies; they appear to me almost in their\r\npristine freshness when my companion, little Paul, already an expert in\r\nthe tactical use of the straw, springs up suddenly, after a long trial\r\nof skill and patience with the recalcitrant, and, brandishing his\r\nclosed hand in the air, cries, excitedly:\r\n\r\n“I’ve got him, I’ve got him!”\r\n\r\nQuick, here’s a bag; in you go, my little Cricket! You shall be petted\r\nand pampered; but mind you teach us something and, first of all, show\r\nus your house.\r\n\r\nIt is a slanting gallery, situated in the grass, on some sunny bank\r\nwhich soon dries after a shower. It is nine inches long at most, hardly\r\nas thick as one’s finger and straight or bent according to the\r\nexigencies of the ground. As a rule, a tuft of grass, which is\r\nrespected by the Cricket when he goes out to browse upon the\r\nsurrounding turf, half-conceals the home, serving as a porch and\r\nthrowing a discreet shade over the entrance. The gently-sloping\r\nthreshold, scrupulously raked and swept, is carried for some distance.\r\nThis is the belvedere on which, when everything is peaceful round\r\nabout, the Cricket sits and scrapes his fiddle.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the house is devoid of luxury, with bare and yet not\r\ncoarse walls. Ample leisure allows the inhabitant to do away with any\r\nunpleasant roughness. At the end of the passage is the bedroom, the\r\nterminal alcove, a little more carefully smoothed than the rest and\r\nslightly wider. All said, it is a very simple abode, exceedingly clean,\r\nfree from damp and conforming with the requirements of a\r\nwell-considered system of hygiene. On the other hand, it is an enormous\r\nundertaking, a regular Cyclopean tunnel, when we consider the modest\r\nmeans of excavation. Let us try to be present at the work. Let us also\r\nenquire at what period the enterprise begins. This obliges us to go\r\nback to the egg.\r\n\r\nAny one wishing to see the Cricket lay her eggs can do so without\r\nmaking great preparations: all that he wants is a little patience,\r\nwhich, according to Buffon, is genius, but which I, more modestly, will\r\ndescribe as the observer’s chief virtue. In April, or at latest in May,\r\nwe establish isolated couples of the insect in flower-pots containing a\r\nlayer of heaped-up earth. Their provisions consist of a lettuce-leaf\r\nrenewed from time to time. A square of glass covers the retreat and\r\nprevents escape.\r\n\r\nSome extremely interesting facts can be obtained with this simple\r\ninstallation, supplemented, if need be, with a wire-gauze cover, the\r\nbest of all cages. We shall return to this matter. For the moment, let\r\nus watch the laying and make sure that the propitious hour does not\r\nevade our vigilance.\r\n\r\nIt is in the first week in June that my assiduous visits begin to show\r\nsatisfactory results. I surprise the mother standing motionless, with\r\nher ovipositor planted perpendicularly in the soil. For a long time she\r\nremains stationed at the same point, heedless of her indiscreet caller.\r\nAt last she withdraws her dibble, removes, more or less perfunctorily,\r\nthe traces of the boring-hole, takes a moment’s rest, walks away and\r\nstarts again somewhere else, now here, now there, all over the area at\r\nher disposal. Her behaviour, though her movements are slower, is a\r\nrepetition of what the Decticus has shown us. Her egg-laying appears to\r\nme to be ended within the twenty-four hours. For greater certainty, I\r\nwait a couple of days longer.\r\n\r\nI then dig up the earth in the pot. The straw-coloured eggs are\r\ncylinders rounded at both ends and measuring about one-ninth of an inch\r\nin length. They are placed singly in the soil, arranged vertically and\r\ngrouped in more or less numerous patches, which correspond with the\r\nsuccessive layings. I find them all over the pot, at a depth of\r\nthree-quarters of an inch. There are difficulties in examining a mass\r\nof earth through a magnifying-glass; but, allowing for these\r\ndifficulties, I estimate the eggs laid by one mother at five or six\r\nhundred. So large a family is sure to undergo a drastic purging before\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThe Cricket’s egg is a little marvel of mechanism. After hatching, it\r\nappears as an opaque white sheath, with a round and very regular\r\naperture at the top; to the edge of this a cap adheres, forming a lid.\r\nInstead of bursting anyhow under the thrusts or cuts of the new-born\r\nlarva, it opens of its own accord along a specially prepared line of\r\nleast resistance.\r\n\r\nIt became important to observe the curious hatching. About a fortnight\r\nafter the egg is laid, two large, round, rusty-black eye-dots darken\r\nthe front end. A little way above these two dots, right at the apex of\r\nthe cylinder, you see the outline of a thin circular swelling. This is\r\nthe line of rupture which is preparing. Soon the translucency of the\r\negg enables the observer to perceive the delicate segmentation of the\r\ntiny creature within. Now is the time to redouble our vigilance and\r\nmultiply our visits, especially in the morning.\r\n\r\nFortune, which loves the persevering, rewards me for my assiduity. All\r\nround this swelling where, by a process of infinite delicacy, the line\r\nof least resistance has been prepared, the end of the egg, pushed back\r\nby the inmate’s forehead, becomes detached, rises and falls to one side\r\nlike the top of a miniature scent-bottle. The Cricket pops out like a\r\nJack-in-the-box.\r\n\r\nWhen he is gone, the shell remains distended, smooth, intact, pure\r\nwhite, with the cap or lid hanging from the opening. A bird’s egg\r\nbreaks clumsily under the blows of a wart that grows for the purpose at\r\nthe end of the chick’s beak; the Cricket’s egg, endowed with a superior\r\nmechanism, opens like an ivory case. The thrust of the inmate’s head is\r\nenough to work the hinge.\r\n\r\nThe hatching of the eggs is hastened by the glorious weather; and the\r\nobserver’s patience is not much tried, the rapidity rivalling that of\r\nthe Dung-beetles. The summer solstice has not yet arrived when the ten\r\ncouples interned under glass for the benefit of my studies are\r\nsurrounded by their numerous progeny. The egg-stage, therefore, lasts\r\njust about ten days.\r\n\r\nI said above that, when the lid of the ivory case is lifted, a young\r\nCricket pops out. This is not quite accurate. What appears at the\r\nopening is the swaddled grub, as yet unrecognizable in a tight-fitting\r\nsheath. I expected to see this wrapper, this first set of baby-clothes,\r\nfor the same reasons that made me anticipate it in the case of the\r\nDecticus:\r\n\r\n“The Cricket,” said I to myself, “is born underground. He also sports\r\ntwo very long antennæ and a pair of overgrown hind-legs, all of which\r\nare cumbrous appendages at the time of the emergence. He must therefore\r\npossess a tunic in which to make his exit.”\r\n\r\nMy forecast, correct enough in principle, was only partly confirmed.\r\nThe new-born Cricket does in fact possess a temporary structure; but,\r\nso far from employing it for the purpose of hoisting himself outside,\r\nhe throws off his clothes as he passes out of the egg.\r\n\r\nTo what circumstances are we to attribute this departure from the usual\r\npractice? Perhaps to this: the Cricket’s egg stays in the ground for\r\nonly a few days before hatching; the egg of the Decticus remains there\r\nfor eight months. The former, save for rare exceptions in a season of\r\ndrought, lies under a thin layer of dry, loose, unresisting earth; the\r\nlatter, on the contrary, finds itself in soil which has been caked\r\ntogether by the persistent rains of autumn and winter and which\r\ntherefore presents serious difficulties. Moreover, the Cricket is\r\nshorter and stouter, less long-shanked than the Decticus. These would\r\nappear to be the reasons for the difference between the two insects in\r\nrespect of their methods of emerging. The Decticus, born lower down,\r\nunder a close-packed layer, needs a climbing-costume with which the\r\nCricket is able to dispense, being less hampered and nearer to the\r\nsurface and having only a powdery layer of earth to pass through.\r\n\r\nThen what is the object of the tights which the Cricket flings aside as\r\nsoon as he is out of the egg? I will answer this question with another:\r\nwhat is the object of the two white stumps, the two pale-coloured\r\nembryo wings carried by the Cricket under his wing-cases, which are\r\nturned into a great mechanism of sound? They are so insignificant, so\r\nfeeble that the insect certainly makes no use of them, any more than\r\nthe Dog utilizes the thumb that hangs limp and lifeless at the back of\r\nhis paw.\r\n\r\nSometimes, for reasons of symmetry, the walls of a house are painted\r\nwith imitation windows to balance the other windows, which are real.\r\nThis is done out of respect for order, the supreme condition of the\r\nbeautiful. In the same way, life has its symmetries, its repetitions of\r\na general prototype. When abolishing an organ that has ceased to be\r\nemployed, it leaves vestiges of it to maintain the primitive\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nThe Dog’s rudimentary thumb predicates the five-fingered hand that\r\ncharacterizes the higher animals; the Cricket’s wing-stumps are\r\nevidence that the insect would normally be capable of flight; the moult\r\nundergone on the threshold of the egg is reminiscent of the\r\ntight-fitting wrapper needed for the laborious exit of the Locustidæ\r\nborn underground. They are so many symmetrical superfluities, so many\r\nremains of a law that has fallen into disuse but never been abrogated.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he is deprived of his delicate tunic, the young Cricket,\r\npale all over, almost white, begins to battle with the soil overhead.\r\nHe hits out with his mandibles; he sweeps aside and kicks behind him\r\nthe powdery obstruction, which offers no resistance. Behold him on the\r\nsurface, amidst the joys of the sunlight and the perils of conflict\r\nwith the living, poor, feeble creature that he is, hardly larger than a\r\nFlea. In twenty-four hours he colours and turns into a magnificent\r\nblackamoor, whose ebon hue vies with that of the adult insect. All that\r\nremains of his original pallor is a white sash that girds his chest and\r\nreminds us of a baby’s leading-string. Very nimble and alert, he sounds\r\nthe surrounding space with his long, quivering antennæ, runs about and\r\njumps with an impetuosity in which his future obesity will forbid him\r\nto indulge.\r\n\r\nThis is also the age when the stomach is still delicate. What sort of\r\nfood does he need? I do not know. I offer him the adult’s treat, tender\r\nlettuce-leaves. He scorns to touch them, or perhaps he takes mouthfuls\r\nso exceedingly small that they escape me.\r\n\r\nIn a few days, with my ten households, I find myself overwhelmed with\r\nfamily cares. What am I to do with my five or six thousand Crickets, a\r\npretty flock, no doubt, but impossible to rear in my ignorance of the\r\ntreatment required? I will set you at liberty, my little dears; I will\r\nentrust you to nature, the sovran nurse.\r\n\r\nThus it comes to pass. I release my legions in the enclosure, here,\r\nthere and everywhere, in the best places. What a concert I shall have\r\noutside my door next year, if they all turn out well! But no, the\r\nsymphony will probably be one of silence, for the savage pruning due to\r\nthe mother’s fertility is bound to come. All that I can hope for is\r\nthat a few couples may survive extermination.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the young Praying Mantes, the first that hasten to\r\nthis manna and the most eager for the slaughter are the little Grey\r\nLizard and the Ant. The latter, loathsome freebooter that she is, will,\r\nI fear, not leave me a single Cricket in the garden. She snaps up the\r\npoor little creatures, eviscerates them and gobbles them down at\r\nfrantic speed.\r\n\r\nOh, the execrable wretch! And to think that we place the Ant in the\r\nfront rank of insects! Books are written in her honour and the stream\r\nof eulogy never ceases; the naturalists hold her in the greatest esteem\r\nand add daily to her reputation, so true is it, among animals as among\r\nmen, that of the various ways of making history, the surest way is to\r\ndo harm to others. [68]\r\n\r\nNobody asks after the Dung-beetle and the Necrophorus, [69] invaluable\r\nscavengers both, whereas everybody knows the Gnat, that drinker of\r\nmen’s blood; the Wasp, that hot-tempered swashbuckler, with her\r\npoisoned dagger; and the Ant, that notorious evil-doer, who, in our\r\nsouthern villages, saps and imperils the rafters of a dwelling with the\r\nsame zest with which she devours a fig. I need not trouble to say more:\r\nevery one will discover in the records of mankind similar instances of\r\nusefulness ignored and frightfulness exalted.\r\n\r\nThe massacre instituted by the Ants and other exterminators is so great\r\nthat my erstwhile populous colonies in the enclosure become too small\r\nto enable me to continue my observations; and I am driven to have\r\nrecourse to information outside. In August, among the fallen leaves, in\r\nthose little oases where the grass has not been wholly scorched by the\r\nsun, I find the young Cricket already rather big, black all over like\r\nthe adult, with not a vestige of the white girdle of his early days. He\r\nhas no domicile. The shelter of a dead leaf, the cover of a flat stone\r\nare enough for him; they represent the tents of a nomad who cares not\r\nwhere he lays his head.\r\n\r\nThis vagabond life continues until the middle of autumn. It is then\r\nthat the Yellow-winged Sphex [70] hunts down the wanderers, an easy\r\nprey, and stores her bag of Crickets underground. She decimates those\r\nwho have survived the Ants’ devastating raids. A settled dwelling, dug\r\na few weeks before the usual time, would save them from the spoilers.\r\nThe sorely-tried victims do not think of it. The bitter experience of\r\nthe centuries has taught them nothing. Though already strong enough to\r\ndig a protecting burrow, they remain invincibly faithful to their\r\nancient customs and would go on roaming though the Sphex stabbed the\r\nlast of their race.\r\n\r\nIt is at the close of October, when the first cold weather threatens,\r\nthat the burrow is taken in hand. The work is very simple, judging by\r\nthe little that my observation of the caged insect has shown me. The\r\ndigging is never done at a bare point in the pan, but always under the\r\nshelter of a withered lettuce-leaf, some remnant of the food provided.\r\nThis takes the place of the grass screen that seems indispensable to\r\nthe secrecy of the establishment.\r\n\r\nThe miner scrapes with his fore-legs and uses the pincers of his\r\nmandibles to extract the larger bits of gravel. I see him stamping with\r\nhis powerful hind-legs, furnished with a double row of spikes; I see\r\nhim raking the rubbish, sweeping it backwards and spreading it\r\nslantwise. There you have the method in its entirety.\r\n\r\nThe work proceeds pretty quickly at first. In the yielding soil of my\r\ncages, the digger disappears underground after a spell that lasts a\r\ncouple of hours. He returns to the entrance at intervals, always\r\nbackwards and always sweeping. Should he be overcome with fatigue, he\r\ntakes a rest on the threshold of his half-finished home, with his head\r\noutside and his antennæ waving feebly. He goes in again and resumes\r\nwork with pincers and rakes. Soon the periods of repose become longer\r\nand wear out my patience.\r\n\r\nThe most urgent part of the work is done. Once the hole is a couple of\r\ninches deep, it suffices for the needs of the moment. The rest will be\r\na long-winded business, resumed in a leisurely fashion, a little one\r\nday and a little the next; the hole will be made deeper and wider as\r\ndemanded by the inclemencies of the weather and the growth of the\r\ninsect. Even in winter, if the temperature be mild and the sun playing\r\nover the entrance to the dwelling, it is not unusual to see the Cricket\r\nshooting out rubbish, a sign of repairs and fresh excavations. Amidst\r\nthe joys of spring, the upkeep of the building still continues. It is\r\nconstantly undergoing improvements and repairs until the owner’s\r\ndecease.\r\n\r\nApril comes to an end and the Cricket’s song begins, at first in rare\r\nand shy solos, soon developing into a general symphony in which each\r\nclod of turf boasts its performer. I am more than inclined to place the\r\nCricket at the head of the spring choristers. In our waste lands, when\r\nthe thyme and the lavender are gaily flowering, he has as his partner\r\nthe Crested Lark, who rises like a lyrical rocket, his throat swelling\r\nwith notes, and from the sky, invisible in the clouds, sheds his sweet\r\nmusic upon the fallows. Down below the Crickets chant the responses.\r\nTheir song is monotonous and artless, but so well-suited, in its very\r\ncrudity, to the rustic gladness of renascent life! It is the hosanna of\r\nthe awakening, the sacred alleluia understood by swelling seed and\r\nsprouting blade. Who deserves the palm in this duet? I should award it\r\nto the Cricket. He surpasses them all, thanks to his numbers and his\r\nunceasing note. Were the Lark to fall silent, the fields blue-grey with\r\nlavender, swinging its fragrant censers before the sun, would still\r\nreceive from this humble chorister a solemn celebration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE CRICKET: THE SONG; THE PAIRING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn steps anatomy and says to the Cricket, bluntly:\r\n\r\n“Show us your musical-box.”\r\n\r\nLike all things of real value, it is very simple; it is based on the\r\nsame principle as that of the Grasshoppers: a bow with a hook to it and\r\na vibrating membrane. The right wing-case overlaps the left and covers\r\nit almost completely, except where it folds back sharply and encases\r\nthe insect’s side. It is the converse of what we see in the Green\r\nGrasshopper, the Decticus, the Ephippiger and their kinsmen. The\r\nCricket is right-handed, the others left-handed.\r\n\r\nThe two wing-cases have exactly the same structure. To know one is to\r\nknow the other. Let us describe the one on the right. It is almost flat\r\non the back and slants suddenly at the side in a right-angled fold,\r\nencircling the abdomen with a pinion which has delicate, parallel veins\r\nrunning in an oblique direction. The dorsal surface has stronger and\r\nmore prominent nervures, of a deep-black colour, which, taken together,\r\nform a strange, complicated design, bearing some resemblance to the\r\nhieroglyphics of an Arabic manuscript.\r\n\r\nBy holding it up to the light, one can see that it is a very pale red,\r\nsave for two large adjoining spaces, a larger, triangular one in front\r\nand a smaller, oval one at the back. Each is framed in a prominent\r\nnervure and scored with faint wrinkles. The first, moreover, is\r\nstrengthened with four or five chevrons; the second with only one,\r\nwhich is bow-shaped. These two areas represent the Grasshoppers’\r\nmirror; they constitute the sounding-areas. The skin is finer here than\r\nelsewhere and transparent, though of a somewhat smoky tint.\r\n\r\nThe front part, which is smooth and slightly red in hue, is bounded at\r\nthe back by two curved, parallel veins, having between them a cavity\r\ncontaining a row of five or six little black wrinkles that look like\r\nthe rungs of a tiny ladder. The left wing-case presents an exact\r\nduplicate of the right. The wrinkles constitute the friction-nervures\r\nwhich intensify the vibration by increasing the number of the points\r\nthat are touched by the bow.\r\n\r\nOn the lower surface, one of the two veins that surround the cavity\r\nwith the rungs becomes a rib cut into the shape of a hook. This is the\r\nbow. I count in it about a hundred and fifty triangular teeth or prisms\r\nof exquisite geometrical perfection.\r\n\r\nIt is a fine instrument indeed, far superior to that of the Decticus.\r\nThe hundred and fifty prisms of the bow, biting into the rungs of the\r\nopposite wing-case, set the four drums in motion at one and the same\r\ntime, the lower pair by direct friction, the upper pair by the shaking\r\nof the friction-apparatus. What a rush of sound! The Decticus, endowed\r\nwith a single paltry mirror, can be heard just a few steps away; the\r\nCricket, possessing four vibratory areas, throws his ditty to a\r\ndistance of some hundreds of yards.\r\n\r\nHe vies with the Cicada in shrillness, without having the latter’s\r\ndisagreeable harshness. Better still: this favoured one knows how to\r\nmodulate his song. The wing-cases, as we said, extend over either side\r\nin a wide fold. These are the dampers which, lowered to a greater or\r\nlesser depth, alter the intensity of the sound and, according to the\r\nextent of their contact with the soft abdomen, allow the insect to sing\r\nmezza voce at one time and fortissimo at another.\r\n\r\nThe exact similarity of the two wing-cases is worthy of attention. I\r\ncan see clearly the function of the upper bow and the four\r\nsounding-areas which it sets in motion; but what is the good of the\r\nlower one, the bow on the left wing? Not resting on anything, it has\r\nnothing to strike with its hook, which is as carefully toothed as the\r\nother. It is absolutely useless, unless the apparatus can invert the\r\norder of its two parts and place that above which was below. After such\r\nan inversion, the perfect symmetry of the instrument would cause the\r\nnecessary mechanism to be reproduced in every respect and the insect\r\nwould be able to stridulate with the hook which is at present\r\nunemployed. It would scrape away as usual with its lower fiddlestick,\r\nnow become the upper; and the tune would remain the same.\r\n\r\nIs this permutation within its power? Can the insect use both\r\npot-hooks, changing from one to the other when it grows tired, which\r\nwould mean that it could keep up its music all the longer? Or are there\r\nat least some Crickets who are permanently left-handed? I expected to\r\nfind this the case, because of the absolute symmetry of the wing-cases.\r\nObservation convinced me of the contrary. I have never come across a\r\nCricket that failed to conform with the general rule. All those whom I\r\nhave examined—and they are many—without a single exception carried the\r\nright wing-case above the left.\r\n\r\nLet us try to interfere and to bring about by artifice what natural\r\nconditions refuse to show us. Using my forceps, very gently, of course,\r\nand without straining the wing-cases, I make these overlap the opposite\r\nway. This result is easily obtained with a little dexterity and\r\npatience. The thing is done. Everything is in order. There is no\r\ndislocation at the shoulders; the membranes are without a crease.\r\nThings could not be better-arranged under normal conditions.\r\n\r\nWas the Cricket going to sing, with his inverted instrument? I was\r\nalmost expecting it, appearances were so much in its favour; but I was\r\nsoon undeceived. The insect submits for a few moments; then, finding\r\nthe inversion uncomfortable, it makes an effort and restores the\r\ninstrument to its regular position. In vain I repeat the operation: the\r\nCricket’s obstinacy triumphs over mine. The displaced wing-cases always\r\nresume their normal arrangement. There is nothing to be done in this\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nShall I be more successful if I make my attempt while the wing-cases\r\nare still immature? At the actual moment, they are stiff membranes,\r\nresisting any changes. The fold is already there; it is at the outset\r\nthat the material should be manipulated. What shall we learn from\r\norgans that are quite new and still plastic, if we invert them as soon\r\nas they appear? The thing is worth trying.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, I go to the larva and watch for the moment of its\r\nmetamorphosis, a sort of second birth. The future wings and wing-cases\r\nform four tiny flaps which, by their shape and their scantiness, as\r\nwell as by the way in which they stick out in different directions,\r\nremind me of the short jackets worn by the Auvergne cheese-makers. I am\r\nmost assiduous in my attendance, lest I should miss the propitious\r\nmoment, and at last have a chance to witness the moulting. In the early\r\npart of May, at about eleven in the morning, a larva casts off its\r\nrustic garments before my eyes. The transformed Cricket is now a\r\nreddish brown, all but the wings and wing-cases, which are beautifully\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nBoth wings and wing-cases, which only issued from their sheaths quite\r\nrecently, are no more than short, crinkly stumps. The former remain in\r\nthis rudimentary state, or nearly so. The latter gradually develop bit\r\nby bit and open out; their inner edges, with a movement too slow to be\r\nperceived, meet one another, on the same plane and at the same level.\r\nThere is no sign to tell us which of the two wing-cases will overlap\r\nthe other. The two edges are now touching. A few moments longer and the\r\nright will be above the left. This is the time to intervene.\r\n\r\nWith a straw I gently change the position, bringing the left edge over\r\nthe right. The insect protests a little and disturbs my manœuvring. I\r\ninsist, while taking every possible care not to endanger these tender\r\norgans, which look as though they were cut out of wet tissue-paper. And\r\nI am quite successful: the left wing-case pushes forward above the\r\nright, but only very little, barely a twenty-fifth of an inch. We will\r\nleave it alone: things will now go of themselves.\r\n\r\nThey go as well as one could wish, in fact. Continuing to spread, the\r\nleft wing-case ends by entirely covering the other. At three o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon, the Cricket has changed from a reddish hue to black, but\r\nthe wing-cases are still white. Two hours more and they also will\r\npossess the normal colouring.\r\n\r\nIt is over. The wing-cases have come to maturity under the artificial\r\narrangement; they have opened out and moulded themselves according to\r\nmy plans; they have taken breadth and consistency and have been born,\r\nso to speak, in an inverted position. As things now are, the Cricket is\r\nleft-handed. Will he definitely remain so? It seems to me that he will;\r\nand my hopes rise higher on the morrow and the day after, for the\r\nwing-cases continue, without any trouble, in their unusual arrangement.\r\nI expect soon to see the artist wield that particular fiddlestick which\r\nthe members of his family never employ. I redouble my watchfulness, so\r\nas to witness his first attempt at playing the violin.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, the novice makes a start. A few brief grating sounds\r\nare heard, the noise of a machine out of gear shifting its parts back\r\ninto their proper order. Then the song begins, with its accustomed tone\r\nand rhythm.\r\n\r\nVeil your face, O foolish experimenter, overconfident in your\r\nmischievous straw! You thought that you had created a new type of\r\ninstrumentalist; and you have obtained nothing at all. The Cricket has\r\nthwarted your schemes: he is scraping with his right fiddlestick and\r\nalways will. With a painful effort, he has dislocated his shoulders,\r\nwhich were made to mature and harden the wrong way; and, in spite of a\r\nset that seemed definite, he has put back on top that which ought to be\r\non top and underneath that which ought to be underneath. Your sorry\r\nscience tried to make a left-handed player of him. He laughs at your\r\ndevices and settles down to be right-handed for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nFranklin left an eloquent plea on behalf of the left hand, which, he\r\nconsidered, deserved as careful training as its fellow. What an immense\r\nadvantage it would be thus to have two servants each as capable as the\r\nother! Yes, certainly; but, except for a few rare instances, is this\r\nequality of strength and skill in the two hands possible?\r\n\r\nThe Cricket answers no: there is an original weakness in the left side,\r\na want of balance, which habit and training can to a certain extent\r\ncorrect, but which they can never cause wholly to disappear. Though\r\nshaped by a training which takes it at its birth and moulds and\r\nsolidifies it on the top of the other, the left wing-case none the less\r\nresumes the lower position when the insect tries to sing. As to the\r\ncause of this original inferiority, that is a problem which belongs to\r\nembryogenesis.\r\n\r\nMy failure confirms the fact that the left wing-case is unable to make\r\nuse of its bow, even when supplemented by the aid of art. Then what is\r\nthe object of that hook whose exquisite precision yields in no respect\r\nto that of the other? We might appeal to reasons of symmetry and talk\r\nabout the repetition of an archetypal design, as I, for want of a\r\nbetter argument, did just now in the matter of the cast raiment which\r\nthe young Cricket leaves on the threshold of his ovular sheath; but I\r\nprefer to confess that this would be but the semblance of an\r\nexplanation, wrapped up in specious language. For the Decticus, the\r\nGrasshopper and the other Locustidæ would come and show us their\r\nwing-cases, one with the bow only, the other with the mirror, and say:\r\n\r\n“Why should the Cricket, our near kinsman, be symmetrical, whereas all\r\nof us Locustidæ, without exception, are asymmetrical?”\r\n\r\nThere is no valid answer to their objection. Let us confess our\r\nignorance and humbly say:\r\n\r\n“I do not know.”\r\n\r\nIt wants but a Midge’s wing to confound our proudest theories.\r\n\r\nEnough of the instrument; let us listen to the music. The Cricket sings\r\non the threshold of his house, in the cheerful sunshine, never indoors.\r\nThe wing-cases, lifted in a double inclined plane and now only partly\r\ncovering each other, utter their stridulant cri-cri in a soft tremolo.\r\nIt is full, sonorous, nicely cadenced and lasts indefinitely. Thus are\r\nthe leisures of solitude beguiled all through the spring. The anchorite\r\nat first sings for his own pleasure. Glad to be alive, he chants the\r\npraises of the sun that shines upon him, the grass that feeds him, the\r\npeaceful retreat that harbours him. The first object of his bow is to\r\nhymn the blessings of life.\r\n\r\nThe hermit also sings for the benefit of his fair neighbours. The\r\nCricket’s nuptials would, I warrant, present a curious scene, if it\r\nwere possible to follow their details far from the commotions of\r\ncaptivity. To seek an opportunity would be labour lost, for the insect\r\nis very shy. I must await one. Shall I ever find it? I do not despair,\r\nin spite of the extraordinary difficulty. For the moment, let us be\r\nsatisfied with what we can learn from probability and the vivarium.\r\n\r\nThe two sexes dwell apart. Both are extremely domestic in their habits.\r\nWhose business is it to make a move? Does the caller go in search of\r\nthe called? Does the serenaded one come to the serenader? If, at\r\npairing-time, sound were the sole guide where homes are far apart, it\r\nwould be necessary for the silent partner to go to the noisy one’s\r\ntrysting-place. But I imagine that, in order to save appearances—and\r\nthis accords with what I learn from my prisoners—the Cricket has\r\nspecial faculties that guide him towards his mute lady-love.\r\n\r\nWhen and how is the meeting effected? I suspect that things take place\r\nin the friendly gloaming and upon the very threshold of the bride’s\r\nhome, upon that sanded esplanade, that state courtyard, which lies just\r\noutside the entrance.\r\n\r\nA nocturnal journey like this, at some twenty paces’ distance, is a\r\nserious undertaking for the Cricket. When he has accomplished his\r\npilgrimage, how will he, the stay-at-home, with his imperfect knowledge\r\nof topography, find his own house again? To return to his Penates must\r\nbe impossible. He roams, I fear, at random, with no place to lay his\r\nhead. He has neither the time nor the heart to dig himself the new\r\nburrow which would be his salvation; and he dies a wretched death,\r\nforming a savoury mouthful for the Toad on his night rounds. His visit\r\nto the lady Cricket has cost him his home and his life. What does he\r\ncare! He has done his duty as a Cricket.\r\n\r\nThis is how I picture events when I combine the probabilities of the\r\nopen country with the realities of the vivarium. I have several couples\r\nin one cage. As a rule, my captives refrain from digging themselves a\r\ndwelling. The hour has passed for any long waiting or long wooing. They\r\nwander about the enclosed space, without troubling about a fixed home,\r\nor else lie low under the shelter of a lettuce-leaf.\r\n\r\nPeace reigns in the household until the quarrelsome instincts of\r\npairing-time break out. Then affrays between suitors are frequent and\r\nlively, though not serious. The two rivals stand face to face, bite\r\neach other in the head, that solid, fang-proof helmet, roll each other\r\nover, pick themselves up and separate. The vanquished Cricket makes off\r\nas fast as he can; the victor insults him with a boastful ditty; then,\r\nmoderating his tone, he veers and tacks around the object of his\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nHe makes himself look smart and, at the same time, submissive. Gripping\r\none of his antennæ with a claw, he takes it in his mandibles to curl it\r\nand grease it with saliva. With his long spurred and red-striped\r\nhind-legs, he stamps the ground impatiently and kicks out at nothing.\r\nHis emotion renders him dumb. His wing-cases, it is true, quiver\r\nrapidly, but they give forth no sound, or at most an agitated rustling.\r\n\r\nA vain declaration! The female Cricket runs and hides herself in a\r\ncurly bit of lettuce. She lifts the curtain a little, however, and\r\nlooks out and wishes to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Et fugit ad salices; et se cupit ante videri, [71]\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid the delightful eclogue, two thousand years ago. Thrice-consecrated\r\nstrategy of love, thou art everywhere the same!\r\n\r\nThe song is resumed, intersected by silences and murmuring quavers.\r\nTouched by so much passion, Galatea, I mean Dame Cricket, issues from\r\nher hiding-place. The other goes up to her, suddenly spins round, turns\r\nhis back to her and flattens his abdomen against the ground. Crawling\r\nbackwards, he makes repeated efforts to slip underneath. The curious\r\nbackward manœuvre at last succeeds. Gently, my little one, gently!\r\nDiscreetly flattened out, you manage to slide under. That’s done it! We\r\nhave our couple. A spermatophore, a granule smaller than a pin’s head,\r\nhangs where it ought to. The meadows will have their Crickets next\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe laying of the eggs follows soon after. Then this cohabitation in\r\ncouples in a cage often brings about domestic quarrels. The father is\r\nknocked about and crippled; his violin is smashed to bits. Outside my\r\ncells, in the open fields, the hen-pecked husband is able to take to\r\nflight; and that indeed is what he appears to do, not without good\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nThis ferocious aversion of the mother for the father, even among the\r\nmost peaceable, gives food for thought. The sweetheart of but now, if\r\nhe come within reach of the lady’s teeth, is eaten more or less; he\r\ndoes not escape from the final interviews without leaving a leg or two\r\nand some shreds of wing-cases behind him. Locusts and Crickets, those\r\nlingering representatives of a bygone world, tell us that the male, a\r\nmere secondary wheel in life’s original mechanism, has to disappear at\r\nshort notice and make room for the real propagator, the real worker,\r\nthe mother.\r\n\r\nLater, in the higher order of creation, sometimes even among insects,\r\nhe is awarded a task as a collaborator; and nothing better could be\r\ndesired: the family must needs gain by it. But the Cricket, faithful to\r\nthe old traditions, has not yet got so far. Therefore the object of\r\nyesterday’s longing becomes to-day an object of hatred, ill-treated,\r\ndisembowelled and eaten up.\r\n\r\nEven when free to escape from his pugnacious mate, the superannuated\r\nCricket soon perishes, a victim to life. In June, all my captives\r\nsuccumb, some dying a natural, others a violent death. The mothers\r\nsurvive for some time in the midst of their newly-hatched family. But\r\nthings happen differently when the males have the advantage of\r\nremaining bachelors: they then enjoy a remarkable longevity. Let me\r\nrelate the facts.\r\n\r\nWe are told that the music-loving Greeks used to keep Cicadæ in cages,\r\nthe better to enjoy their singing. I venture to disbelieve the whole\r\nstory. In the first place, the harsh clicking of the Cicadæ, when long\r\ncontinued at close quarters, is a torture to ears that are at all\r\ndelicate. The Greeks’ sense of hearing was too well-disciplined to take\r\npleasure in such raucous sounds away from the general concert of the\r\nfields, which is heard at a distance.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, it is absolutely impossible to bring up Cicadæ in\r\ncaptivity, unless we cover over an olive-tree or a plane-tree, which\r\nwould supply us with a vivarium very difficult to instal on a\r\nwindow-sill. A single day spent in a cramped enclosure would make the\r\nhigh-flying insect die of boredom.\r\n\r\nIs it not possible that people have confused the Cricket with the\r\nCicada, as they also do the Green Grasshopper? With the Cricket they\r\nwould be quite right. He is one who bears captivity gaily: his\r\nstay-at-home ways predispose him to it. He lives happily and whirrs\r\nwithout ceasing in a cage no larger than a man’s fist, provided that we\r\nserve him with his lettuce-leaf every day. Was it not he whom the small\r\nboys of Athens reared in little wire cages hanging on a window-frame?\r\n\r\nTheir successors in Provence and all over the south have the same\r\ntastes. In the towns, a Cricket becomes the child’s treasured\r\npossession. The insect, petted and pampered, tells him in its ditty of\r\nthe simple joys of the country. Its death throws the whole household\r\ninto a sort of mourning.\r\n\r\nWell, these recluses, these compulsory celibates, live to be\r\npatriarchs. They keep fit and well long after their cronies in the\r\nfields have succumbed; and they go on singing till September. Those\r\nadditional three months, a long space of time, double their existence\r\nin the adult form.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this longevity is obvious. Nothing wears one out so\r\nquickly as life. The wild Crickets have gaily spent their reserves of\r\nenergy on the ladies; the more fervent their ardour, the speedier their\r\ndissolution. The others, their incarcerated kinsmen, leading a very\r\nquiet life, have acquired a further period of existence by reason of\r\ntheir forced abstinence from too costly joys. Having neglected to\r\nperform the superlative duty of a Cricket, they obstinately refuse to\r\ndie until the very last moment.\r\n\r\nA brief study of the three other Crickets of my neighbourhood has\r\ntaught me nothing of any interest. Possessing no fixed abode, no\r\nburrow, they wander about from one temporary shelter to another, under\r\nthe dry grass or in the cracks of the clods. They all carry the same\r\nmusical instrument as the Field Cricket, with slight variations of\r\ndetail. Their song is much alike in all cases, allowing for differences\r\nof size. The smallest of the family, the Bordeaux Cricket, stridulates\r\noutside my door, under the cover of the box borders. He even ventures\r\ninto the dark corners of the kitchen, but his song is so faint that it\r\ntakes a very attentive ear to hear it and to discover at last where the\r\ninsect lies hidden.\r\n\r\nIn our part of the world, we do not have the House Cricket, that\r\ndenizen of bakers’ shops and rural fireplaces. But, though the crevices\r\nunder the hearthstones in my village are silent, the summer nights make\r\namends by filling the country-side with a charming symphony unknown in\r\nthe north. Spring, during its sunniest hours, has the Field Cricket as\r\nits musician; the calm summer nights have the Italian Cricket (Œcanthus\r\npellucens, Scop.). One diurnal, the other nocturnal, they share the\r\nfine weather between them. By the time that the first has ceased to\r\nsing, it is not long before the other begins his serenade.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Cricket has not the black dress and the clumsy shape\r\ncharacteristic of the family. He is, on the contrary, a slender,\r\nfragile insect, quite pale, almost white, as beseems his nocturnal\r\nhabits. You are afraid of crushing him, if you merely take him in your\r\nfingers. He leads an aerial existence on shrubs of every kind, or on\r\nthe taller grasses; and he rarely descends to earth. His song, the\r\nsweet music of the still, hot evenings from July to October, begins at\r\nsunset and continues for the best part of the night.\r\n\r\nThis song is known to everybody here, for the smallest clump of bushes\r\nhas its orchestra. It is heard even in the granaries, into which the\r\ninsect sometimes strays, attracted by the fodder. But the pale\r\nCricket’s ways are so mysterious that nobody knows exactly the source\r\nof the serenade, which is very erroneously ascribed to the Common Black\r\nCricket, who at this period is quite young and silent.\r\n\r\nThe song is a soft, slow gri-i-i, gri-i-i, which is rendered more\r\nexpressive by a slight tremolo. On hearing it, we divine both the\r\nextreme delicacy and the size of the vibrating membranes. If nothing\r\nhappen to disturb the insect, settled in the lower leaves, the sound\r\nremains unaltered; but, at the least noise, the executant becomes a\r\nventriloquist. You heard him here, quite close, in front of you; and\r\nnow, all of a sudden, you hear him over there, fifteen yards away,\r\ncontinuing his ditty softened by distance.\r\n\r\nYou move across. Nothing. The sound comes from the original place. No,\r\nit doesn’t, after all. This time, it is coming from over there, on the\r\nleft, or rather from the right; or is it from behind? We are absolutely\r\nat a loss, quite unable to guide ourselves by the ear towards the spot\r\nwhere the insect is chirping.\r\n\r\nIt needs a fine stock of patience and the most minute precautions to\r\ncapture the singer by the light of a lantern. The few specimens caught\r\nunder these conditions and caged have supplied me with the little that\r\nI know about the musician who is so clever at baffling our ears.\r\n\r\nThe wing-cases are both formed of a broad, dry, diaphanous membrane,\r\nfine as a white onion-skin and capable of vibrating throughout its\r\nwhole area. They are shaped like a segment of a circle thinning towards\r\nthe upper end. This segment folds back at right angles along a\r\nprominent longitudinal vein and forms a flap which encloses the\r\ninsect’s side when at rest.\r\n\r\nThe right wing-case lies above the left. Its inner edge bears\r\nunderneath, near the root, a knob which is the starting-point of five\r\nradiating veins, of which two run upwards, two downwards and the fifth\r\nalmost transversely. The last-named, which is slightly reddish, is the\r\nmain part, in short the bow, as is shown by the fine notches cut across\r\nit. The rest of the wing-case presents a few other veins of minor\r\nimportance, which keep the membrane taut without forming part of the\r\nfriction-apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe left or lower wing-case is similarly constructed, with this\r\ndifference that the bow, the knob and the veins radiating from it now\r\noccupy the upper surface. We find, moreover, that the two bows, the\r\nright and the left, cross each other obliquely.\r\n\r\nWhen the song has its full volume, the wing-cases, raised high up and\r\nresembling a pair of large gauze sails, touch only at their inner\r\nedges. Then the two bows fit into each other slantwise and their mutual\r\nfriction produces the sonorous vibration of the two stretched\r\nmembranes.\r\n\r\nThe sound appears to be modified according as the strokes of each bow\r\nbear upon the knob, which is itself wrinkled, on the opposite\r\nwing-case, or upon one of the four smooth radiating veins. This would\r\ngo some way towards explaining the illusions produced by music which\r\nseems to come from here, there and everywhere when the timid insect\r\nbecomes distrustful.\r\n\r\nThe illusion of loud or soft, open or muffled sounds and consequently\r\nof distance, which forms the chief resource of the ventriloquist’s art,\r\nhas another, easily discovered source. For the open sounds, the\r\nwing-cases are raised to their full height; for the muffled sounds,\r\nthey are lowered more or less. In the latter position, their outer\r\nedges press to a varying extent upon the insect’s yielding sides, thus\r\nmore or less decreasing the vibratory surface and reducing the volume\r\nof sound.\r\n\r\nA gentle touch with one’s finger stifles the sound of a ringing\r\nwine-glass and changes it into a veiled, indefinite note that seems to\r\ncome from afar. The pale Cricket knows this acoustic secret. He\r\nmisleads those who are hunting for him by pressing the edges of his\r\nvibrating flaps against his soft abdomen. Our musical instruments have\r\ntheir dampers, their sourdines; that of Œcanthus pellucens vies with\r\nand surpasses them in the simplicity of its method and the perfection\r\nof its results.\r\n\r\nThe Field Cricket and his kinsmen also employ the sourdine by clasping\r\ntheir abdomen higher or lower with the edge of their wing-cases; but\r\nnone of them obtains from this procedure such deceptive effects as\r\nthose of the Italian Cricket.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this illusion of distance, which, at the faintest sound\r\nof footsteps, is constantly taking us by surprise, we have the purity\r\nof the note, with its soft tremolo. I know no prettier or more limpid\r\ninsect song, heard in the deep stillness of an August evening. How\r\noften, per amica silentia lunæ, [72] have I lain down on the ground,\r\nscreened by the rosemary-bushes, to listen to the delicious concert of\r\nthe harmas! [73]\r\n\r\nThe nocturnal Cricket swarms in the enclosure. Every tuft of\r\nred-flowering rock-rose has its chorister; so has every clump of\r\nlavender. The bushy arbutus-shrubs, the turpentine-trees, all become\r\norchestras. And, with its clear and charming voice, the whole of this\r\nlittle world is sending questions and responses from shrub to shrub, or\r\nrather, indifferent to the hymns of others, chanting its gladness for\r\nitself alone.\r\n\r\nHigh up, immediately above my head, the Swan stretches its great cross\r\nalong the Milky Way; below, all around me, the insects’ symphony rises\r\nand falls. The infinitesimal telling its joys makes me forget the\r\npageant of the stars. We know nothing of those celestial eyes which\r\nlook down upon us, placid and cold, with scintillations that are like\r\nblinking eyelids. Science tells us of their distance, their speed,\r\ntheir mass, their volume; it overwhelms us with enormous figures,\r\nstupefies us with immensities; but it does not succeed in stirring a\r\nfibre within us. Why? Because it lacks the great secret, that of life.\r\nWhat is there up there? What do those suns warm? Worlds like ours,\r\nreason declares; planets whereon life revolves in infinite variety. It\r\nis a superb conception of the universe, but, when all is said, only a\r\nconception, not supported by obvious facts, those supreme proofs within\r\nthe reach of all. The probable, the extremely probable, is not the\r\nmanifest, which forces itself upon us irresistibly and leaves no room\r\nfor doubt.\r\n\r\nIn your company, on the contrary, O my Crickets, I feel the throbbing\r\nof life, which is the soul of our lump of clay; and that is why, under\r\nmy rosemary-hedge, I give but an absent glance at the constellation of\r\nthe Swan and devote all my attention to your serenade! A dab of\r\nanimated glair, capable of pleasure and of pain, surpasses in interest\r\nthe immensity of brute matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE LOCUSTS: THEIR FUNCTION; THEIR ORGAN OF SOUND\r\n\r\n\r\n“Mind you are ready, children, to-morrow morning, before the sun gets\r\ntoo hot: we are going Locust-hunting.”\r\n\r\nThis announcement throws the household into great excitement at\r\nbed-time. What do my little helpmates see in their dreams? Blue wings,\r\nred wings, suddenly flung out fanwise; long, saw-toothed legs,\r\npale-blue or pink, which kick out when we hold their owners in our\r\nfingers; great shanks acting as springs that make the insect leap\r\nforward like a projectile shot from some dwarf catapult hidden in the\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nWhat they behold in sleep’s sweet magic lantern I also happen to see.\r\nLife lulls us with the same simple things in its first stages and its\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nIf there be one peaceful and safe form of hunting, one that comes\r\nwithin the powers of old age and childhood alike, it is Locust-hunting.\r\nOh, what delicious mornings we owe to it! What happy moments when the\r\nmulberries are black and allow my assistants to go pilfering here and\r\nthere in the bushes! What memorable excursions on the slopes covered\r\nwith sparse grass, tough and burnt yellow by the sun! I retain a vivid\r\nrecollection of all this; and my children will do the same.\r\n\r\nLittle Paul has nimble legs, a ready hand and a piercing eye. He\r\ninspects the clumps of everlastings where the Tryxalis solemnly nods\r\nhis sugar-loaf head; he scrutinizes the bushes out of which the big\r\nGrey Locust suddenly flies like a little bird surprised by the hunter.\r\nGreat disappointment on the part of the latter, who, after first\r\nrushing off at full speed, stops and gazes in wonder at this mock\r\nSwallow flying far away. He will have better luck another time. We\r\nshall not go home without a few of those magnificent prizes.\r\n\r\nYounger than her brother, Marie Pauline patiently watches for the\r\nItalian Locust, with his pink wings and carmine hind-legs; but she\r\nreally prefers another jumper, the most elegantly attired of all. Her\r\nfavourite wears a St. Andrew’s cross on the small of his back, which is\r\nmarked by four white, slanting stripes. His livery has patches of\r\nverdigris, the exact colour of the patina on old bronze medals. With\r\nher hand raised in the air, ready to swoop down, she approaches very\r\nsoftly, stooping low. Whoosh! That’s done it! Quick, a screw of paper\r\nto receive the treasure, which, thrust head first into the opening,\r\nplunges with one bound to the bottom of the funnel.\r\n\r\nThus are our bags distended one by one; thus are our boxes filled.\r\nBefore the heat becomes too great to bear, we are in possession of a\r\nnumber of varied specimens which, raised in captivity, will perhaps\r\nteach us something, if we know how to question them. Thereupon we go\r\nhome again. The Locust has made three people happy at a small cost.\r\n\r\nThe first question that I put to my boarders is this:\r\n\r\n“What function do you perform in the fields?”\r\n\r\nYou have a bad reputation, I know; the text-books describe you as\r\nnoxious. Do you deserve this reproach? I take the liberty of doubting\r\nit, except, of course, in the case of the terrible ravagers who form\r\nthe scourge of Africa and the east.\r\n\r\nThe ill repute of those voracious eaters has left its mark on you all,\r\nthough I look upon you as much more useful than injurious. Never, so\r\nfar as I know, have our peasants complained of you. What damage could\r\nthey lay to your charge?\r\n\r\nYou nibble the tops of the tough grasses which the Sheep refuses to\r\ntouch; you prefer the lean swards to the fat pastures; you browse on\r\nsterile land where none but you would find the wherewithal to feed\r\nhimself; you live upon what could never be used without the aid of your\r\nhealthy stomach.\r\n\r\nBesides, by the time that you frequent the fields, the only thing that\r\nmight tempt you, the green wheat, has long since yielded its grain and\r\ndisappeared. If you happen to get into the kitchen-gardens and levy\r\ntoll on them to some slight extent, it is not a rank offence. A man can\r\nconsole himself for a piece bitten out of a leaf or two of salad.\r\n\r\nTo measure the importance of things by the foot-rule of one’s own\r\nturnip-patch is a horrible method, which makes us forget the essential\r\nfor the sake of a trivial detail. The short-sighted man would upset the\r\norder of the universe rather than sacrifice a dozen plums. If he thinks\r\nof the insect at all, it is only to speak of its extermination.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this is not and never will be in his power. Look at the\r\nconsequences, for instance, of the disappearance of the Locust, who is\r\naccused of stealing a few crumbs from earth’s rich table. In September\r\nand October, the Turkeys are driven into the stubble-fields, under the\r\ncharge of a child armed with two long reeds. The expanse over which the\r\ngobbling flock slowly spreads is bare, dry and burnt by the sun. At the\r\nmost, a few ragged thistles raise their belated heads. What do the\r\nbirds do in a desert like this, simply reeking with famine? They cram\r\nthemselves, in order to do honour to the Christmas table; they wax fat;\r\ntheir flesh becomes firm and appetizing. With what, pray? With Locusts,\r\nwhom they snap up here and there, a delicious stuffing for their greedy\r\ncrops. This autumnal manna, which costs nothing and is richly\r\nflavoured, contributes to the elaboration and the improvement of the\r\nsucculent roast that will be so largely eaten on the festive evening.\r\n\r\nWhen the Guinea-fowl, that domesticated game-bird, roams around the\r\nfarm, uttering her rasping note, what is it that she seeks? Seeds, no\r\ndoubt, but, above all things, Locusts, who puff her out under the wings\r\nwith a pad of fat and give greater flavour to her flesh.\r\n\r\nThe Hen, much to our advantage, is just as fond of them. She well knows\r\nthe virtues of that dainty dish, which acts as a tonic and increases\r\nher laying-capacity. When left at liberty, she hardly ever fails to\r\nlead her family to the stubble-fields, so that they may learn how to\r\nsnap up the exquisite mouthful deftly. In fact, all the denizens of the\r\npoultry-yard, when free to wander about at will, owe to the Locust a\r\nvaluable addition to their diet.\r\n\r\nIt becomes a much more important matter outside our domestic fowls. If\r\nyou are a sportsman, if you are able to appreciate the value of the\r\nRed-legged Partridge, the glory of our southern hills, open the crop of\r\nthe bird which you have just brought down. You will see that it\r\ncontains a splendid certificate to the services rendered by the\r\nmuch-maligned insect. You will find it, nine times out of ten, more or\r\nless crammed with Locusts. The Partridge dotes on them, prefers them to\r\nseed as long as he is able to catch them. This highly-flavoured,\r\nsubstantial, stimulating fare would almost make him forget the\r\nexistence of seeds, if it were only there all the year round.\r\n\r\nLet us now consult the illustrious black-footed tribe, so warmly\r\ncelebrated by Tousserel. [74] The head of the family is the Wheatear,\r\nthe Cul-blanc, [75] as the Provençal calls him, who grows disgracefully\r\nfat in September and supplies delicious material for the skewer. At the\r\ntime when I used to indulge in ornithological expeditions, I made a\r\npractice of jotting down the contents of the birds’ crops and gizzards,\r\nso as to become acquainted with their diet. Here is the Wheatear’s bill\r\nof fare: Locusts, first of all; next, many various kinds of Beetles,\r\nsuch as Weevils, Opatra, Chrysomelæ, or Golden-apple-beetles, Cassidæ,\r\nor Tortoise-beetles, and Harpali; in the third place, Spiders, Iuli,\r\n[76] Woodlice and small Snails; lastly and rarely, bramble-berries and\r\nthe berries of the Cornelian cherry.\r\n\r\nAs you see, there is a little of all kinds of small game, just as it\r\ncomes. The insect-eater does not turn his attention to berries except\r\nin the last resort, at seasons of dearth. Out of forty-eight cases\r\nmentioned in my notes, vegetable food appears only three times, in\r\ntrifling proportions. The predominant item, both as regards frequency\r\nand quantity, is the Locust, the smaller specimens being chosen, in\r\norder not to tax the bird’s swallowing-powers.\r\n\r\nEven so with the other little birds of passage which, when autumn\r\ncomes, call a halt in Provence and prepare for the great pilgrimage by\r\naccumulating on their rumps a travelling-allowance of fat. All of them\r\nfeast on the Locust, that rich fare; all, in the waste lands and\r\nfallows, gather as best they can the hopping tit-bit, that source of\r\nvigour for flying. Locusts are the manna of little birds on their\r\nautumnal journey.\r\n\r\nNor does man himself scorn them. An Arab author quoted by General\r\nDaumas [77] in his book, Le Grand désert, tells us:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Grasshoppers [78] are of good nourishment for men and Camels.\r\n    Their claws, wings and head are taken away and they are eaten fresh\r\n    or dried, either roast or boiled and served with flesh, flour and\r\n    herbs.\r\n\r\n    “When dried in the sun, they are ground to powder and mixed with\r\n    milk or kneaded with flour; and they are then cooked with fat or\r\n    with butter and salt.\r\n\r\n    “Camels eat them greedily and are given them dried or roast, heaped\r\n    in a hollow between two layers of charcoal. Thus also do the\r\n    Nubians eat them.\r\n\r\n    “When Miriam [79] prayed God that she might eat flesh unpolluted by\r\n    blood, God sent her Grasshoppers.\r\n\r\n    “When the wives of the Prophet were sent Grasshoppers as a gift,\r\n    they placed some of these in baskets and sent them to other women.\r\n\r\n    “Once, when the Caliph Omar was asked if it were lawful to eat\r\n    Grasshoppers, he made answer:\r\n\r\n    “‘Would that I had a basket of them to eat!’\r\n\r\n    “Wherefore, from this testimony, it is very sure that, by the grace\r\n    of God, Grasshoppers were given to man for his nourishment.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout going so far as the Arab naturalist, which would presuppose a\r\npower of digestion not bestowed on every man, I feel entitled to say\r\nthat the Locust is a gift of God to a multitude of birds, as witness\r\nthe long array of gizzards which I consulted.\r\n\r\nMany others, notably the reptile, hold him in esteem. I have found him\r\nin the belly of the Rassado, that terror of the small girls of\r\nProvence, I mean the Eyed Lizard, who loves rocky shelters turned into\r\na furnace by a torrid sun. And I have often caught the little Grey\r\nLizard of the walls in the act of carrying off, in his tapering snout,\r\nthe spolia opima of some long-awaited Acridian.\r\n\r\nEven fish revel in him, when good fortune brings him to them. The\r\nLocust’s leap has no definite goal. A projectile discharged blindly,\r\nthe insect comes down wherever the unpremeditated release of its\r\nsprings shoots it. If the place where it falls happen to be the water,\r\na fish is there at once to gobble up the dripping victim. It is\r\nsometimes a fatal dainty, for anglers use the Locust when they wish to\r\nbait their hook with a particularly attractive morsel.\r\n\r\nWithout expatiating further on the devourers of this small game, I can\r\nclearly see the great usefulness of the Acridian who by successive\r\nleaps transmits to man, that most wasteful of eaters, the lean grass\r\nnow converted into exquisite fare. Gladly therefore would I say, with\r\nthe Arab writer:\r\n\r\n“Wherefore, from this testimony, it is very sure that, by the grace of\r\nGod, Grasshoppers were given to man for his nourishment.”\r\n\r\nOne thing alone makes me hesitate: the direct consumption of the\r\nLocust. As regards indirect consumption, under the form of Partridge,\r\nyoung Turkey and others, none will think of denying him his praises. Is\r\ndirect consumption then so unpleasant? That was not the opinion of\r\nOmar, [80] the mighty caliph, the destroyer of the library of\r\nAlexandria. His stomach was as rude as his intellect; and, by his own\r\naccount, he would have relished a basket of Grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nLong before him, others were content to eat them, though in this case\r\nit was a wise frugality. Clad in his Camel’s-hair garment, St. John the\r\nBaptist, the bringer of good tidings and the great stirrer of the\r\npopulace in the days of Herod, lived in the desert on Grasshoppers and\r\nwild honey:\r\n\r\n“And his meat was locusts and wild honey,” says the Gospel according to\r\nSt. Matthew.\r\n\r\nWild honey I know, if only from the pots of the Chalicodoma. [81] It is\r\na very agreeable food. There remains the Grasshopper of the desert,\r\notherwise the Locust. In my youth, like every small boy, I appreciated\r\na Grasshopper’s leg, which I used to eat raw. It is not without\r\nflavour. To-day let us rise a peg higher and try the fare of Omar and\r\nSt. John the Baptist.\r\n\r\nI capture some fat Locusts and have them cooked in a very rough and\r\nready fashion, fried with butter and salt, as the Arab author\r\nprescribes. We all of us, big and little, partake of the queer dish at\r\ndinner. We pronounce favourably upon the caliph’s delicacy. It is far\r\nsuperior to the Cicadæ extolled by Aristotle. It has a certain shrimpy\r\nflavour, a taste that reminds one of grilled Crab; and, were it not\r\nthat the shell is very tough for such slight edible contents, I would\r\ngo to the length of saying that it is good, without, however, feeling\r\nany desire for more.\r\n\r\nMy curiosity as a naturalist has now twice allowed itself to be tempted\r\nby the dishes of antiquity: Cicadæ first; Locusts next. Neither the one\r\nnor the other roused my enthusiasm. We must leave these things to the\r\npowerful jaws of the negroes and the huge appetite of which the famous\r\ncaliph gave proof.\r\n\r\nThe queasiness of our stomachs, however, in no way decreases the\r\nLocusts’ merits. Those little browsers of the burnt grass play a great\r\npart in the workshop where our food is prepared. They swarm in vast\r\nlegions which roam over the barren wastes, pecking here and there,\r\nturning what could not otherwise be used into a foodstuff which is\r\npassed on to a host of consumers, including, first and foremost, the\r\nbird that often falls to man’s share.\r\n\r\nPricked relentlessly by the needs of the stomach, the world knows no\r\nmore imperative duty than the acquisition of food. To secure a seat in\r\nthe refectory, each animal expends its sum total of activity, industry,\r\ntoil, trickery and strife; and the general banquet, which should be a\r\njoy, is to many a torment. Man is far from escaping the miseries of the\r\nstruggle for food. On the contrary, only too often he tastes them in\r\nall their bitterness.\r\n\r\nIngenious as he is, will he succeed in freeing himself from them?\r\nScience says yes. Chemistry promises, in the near future, a solution of\r\nthe problem of subsistence. The sister science, physics, is preparing\r\nthe way. Already it is contemplating how to get more and better work\r\ndone by the sun, that great sluggard who thinks that he has done his\r\nduty by us when he sweetens our grapes and ripens our corn. It will\r\nbottle his heat, garner his rays, in order to control them and employ\r\nthem where we think fit.\r\n\r\nWith these supplies of energy, the hearths will blaze, the wheels will\r\nturn, the pestles pound, the graters grate, the rollers grind; and the\r\nwork of agriculture, so wasteful at present, thwarted as it is by the\r\ninclemency of the seasons, will become factory-work, yielding\r\neconomical and safe returns.\r\n\r\nThen chemistry will step in, with its legion of cunning reagents. It\r\nwill turn everything into nutritious matter, in a highly concentrated\r\nform, capable of being assimilated in its entirety and leaving hardly\r\nany foul residue. A loaf of bread will be a pill; a rumpsteak a drop of\r\njelly. Of agricultural labour, the inferno of barbarian times, nothing\r\nwill remain but a memory, of interest only to the historians. The last\r\nSheep and the last Ox will figure, neatly stuffed, as curiosities in\r\nour museums, together with the Mammoth dug up from the Siberian\r\nice-fields.\r\n\r\nAll that old lumber—herds and flocks, seeds, fruits and vegetables—is\r\ndoomed to disappear some day. Progress demands it, we are told; and the\r\nchemist’s retort, which, in its presumptuous fashion, recognizes\r\nnothing as impossible, repeats the assertion.\r\n\r\nThis golden age of foodstuffs leaves me very incredulous. When it is a\r\nquestion of obtaining some new toxin, science displays alarming\r\ningenuity. Our laboratory collections are veritable arsenals of\r\npoisons. When the object is to invent a still in which potatoes shall\r\nbe made to yield torrents of alcohol capable of turning us into a\r\nnation of sots, the resources of industry know no limits. But to\r\nprocure by artificial means a single mouthful of really nourishing\r\nmatter is a very different business. Never has any such product\r\nsimmered in our retorts. The future, beyond a doubt, will do no better.\r\nOrganized matter, the only true food, escapes the formulæ of the\r\nlaboratory. Its chemist is life.\r\n\r\nWe shall do well therefore to preserve agriculture and our herds. Let\r\nus leave our nourishment to be prepared by the patient work of plants\r\nand animals, let us mistrust the brutal factory and keep our confidence\r\nfor more delicate methods and, in particular, for the Locust’s stomach,\r\nwhich assists in the making of the Christmas Turkey. That stomach has\r\nculinary receipts which the chemist’s retort will always envy without\r\nsucceeding in imitating them.\r\n\r\nThis picker-up of nutritive trifles, destined to support a crowd of\r\npaupers, possesses musical powers wherewith to express his joys.\r\nConsider a Locust at rest, blissfully digesting his meal and enjoying\r\nthe sunshine. With sharp strokes of the bow, three or four times\r\nrepeated and spaced with pauses, he sings his ditty. He scrapes his\r\nsides with his great hind-legs, using now one, now the other, anon both\r\nat a time.\r\n\r\nThe result is very poor, so slight indeed that I am obliged to have\r\nrecourse to little Paul’s ear in order to make sure that there is a\r\nsound at all. Such as it is, it resembles the creaking of the point of\r\na needle pushed across a sheet of paper. There you have the whole song,\r\nso near akin to silence.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more to be expected from so rudimentary an instrument.\r\nWe have nothing here similar to what the Grasshopper clan have shown\r\nus: no toothed bow, no vibrating membrane stretched into a drum. Let\r\nus, for instance, take a look at the Italian Locust (Caloptenus\r\nitalicus, Lin.), whose apparatus of sound is repeated in the other\r\nstridulating Acridians. His hinder thighs are keel-shaped above and\r\nbelow. Each surface, moreover, has two powerful longitudinal nervures.\r\nBetween these main parts there is, in either case, a graduated row of\r\nsmaller, chevron-shaped nervures; and the whole thing is as prominent\r\nand as plainly marked on this outer side as on the inner one. And what\r\nsurprises me even more than this similarity between the two surfaces is\r\nthat all these nervures are smooth. Lastly, the lower edge of the\r\nwing-cases, the edge rubbed by the thighs which serve as a bow, also\r\nhas nothing particular about it. We see, as indeed we do all over the\r\nwing-cases, nervures that are powerful but devoid of any rasping\r\nroughness or the least denticulation.\r\n\r\nWhat can this artless attempt at a musical instrument produce? Just as\r\nmuch as a dry membrane will emit when you rub it. And for the sake of\r\nthis trifle the insect lifts and lowers its thighs, in sharp jerks, and\r\nis satisfied with the result. It rubs its sides very much as we rub our\r\nhands together in sign of contentment, with no intention of making a\r\nsound. That is its own particular way of expressing its joy in life.\r\n\r\nExamine it when the sky is partly obscured and the sun shines\r\nintermittently. There comes a rift in the clouds. Forthwith the thighs\r\nbegin to scrape, increasing their activity as the sun grows hotter. The\r\nstrains are very brief, but they are renewed so long as the sunshine\r\ncontinues. The sky becomes overcast. Then and there the song ceases, to\r\nbe resumed with the next gleam of sunlight, always in brief spasms.\r\nThere is no mistaking it: here, in these fond lovers of the light, we\r\nhave a mere expression of happiness. The Locust has his moments of\r\ngaiety when his crop is full and the sun benign.\r\n\r\nNot all the Acridians indulge in this joyous rubbing. The Tryxalis\r\n(Truxalis nasuta, Lin.), who sports a pair of immensely elongated\r\nhind-legs, maintains a gloomy silence even under the most vigorous\r\ncaresses of the sun. I have never seen him move his shanks like a bow;\r\nhe seems unable to use them—so long are they—for anything but hopping.\r\n\r\nDumb likewise, apparently as a consequence of the excessive length of\r\nhis hind-legs, the big Grey Locust (Pachytilus cinerescens, Fabr.) has\r\na peculiar way of diverting himself. The giant often visits me in the\r\nenclosure, even in the depth of winter. In calm weather, when the sun\r\nis hot, I surprise him in the rosemaries, with his wings unfurled and\r\nfluttering rapidly for a quarter of an hour at a time, as though for\r\nflight. His twirling is so gentle, in spite of its extreme speed, as to\r\ncreate hardly a perceptible rustle.\r\n\r\nOthers still are much less well-endowed. One such is the Pedestrian\r\nLocust (Pezotettix pedestris, Lin.), the companion of the Alpine\r\nAnalota on the ridges of the Ventoux. This foot-passenger strolling\r\namid the paronychias (P. serpyllifola) which lie spread in silvery\r\nexpanses over the Alpine region; this short-jacketed hopper, the guest\r\nof the androsaces (A. villosa), whose tiny flowers, white as the\r\nneighbouring snows, smile from out of their rosy eyes, has the same\r\nfresh colouring as the plants around him. The sunlight, less veiled in\r\nmists in the loftier regions, has made him a costume combining beauty\r\nand simplicity: a pale-brown satin back; a yellow abdomen; big thighs\r\ncoral-red below; hind-legs a glorious azure-blue, with an ivory anklet\r\nin front. But, being incapable of going beyond the larval form, this\r\ndandy remains short-coated.\r\n\r\nHe has for wing-cases two wrinkled slips, distant one from the other\r\nand hardly covering the first segment of the abdomen, and for wings two\r\nstumps that are even more abbreviated. All this hardly covers his\r\nnakedness down to the waist. Any one seeing him for the first time\r\ntakes him for a larva and is wrong. It is indeed the adult insect, ripe\r\nfor mating; and the insect will remain in this undress to the end.\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to add that, with this skimpy jacket, stridulation is\r\nimpossible? The big hind-thighs are there, it is true; but what is\r\nlacking, for them to rub upon, is the grating surface, the edge of the\r\nwing-cases. Whereas the other Locusts are not to be described as noisy,\r\nthis one is absolutely dumb. In vain have the most delicate ears around\r\nme listened with might and main: there has never been the least sound\r\nduring the three months’ home breeding. This silent one must have other\r\nmeans of expressing his joys and summoning his partner to the wedding.\r\nWhat are they? I do not know.\r\n\r\nNor do I know why the insect deprives itself of wings and remains a\r\nplodding wayfarer, when its near kinsmen, on the same Alpine swards,\r\nare excellently equipped for flight. It possesses the germs of wing and\r\nwing-case, gifts which the egg gives to the larva; and it does not\r\nthink of using these germs by developing them. It persists in hopping,\r\nwith no further ambition; it is satisfied to go on foot, to remain a\r\nPedestrian Locust, as the nomenclators call it, when it might, one\r\nwould think, acquire wings, that higher mechanism of locomotion.\r\n\r\nRapid flitting from crest to crest, over the valleys deep in snow; easy\r\nflight from a shorn pasture to one not yet exploited: can these be\r\nnegligible advantages to the Pedestrian Locust? Obviously not. The\r\nother Acridians and in particular his fellow-dwellers on the\r\nmountain-tops possess wings and are all the better for them. What is\r\nhis reason for not doing as they do? It would be very profitable to\r\nextract from their sheaths the sails which he keeps packed away in\r\nuseless stumps; and he does not do it. Why?\r\n\r\n“Arrested development,” says some one.\r\n\r\nVery well. Life is arrested half-way through its work; the insect does\r\nnot attain the ultimate form of which it bears the emblem. For all its\r\nscientific turn of phrase, the reply is not really a reply at all. The\r\nquestion returns under another guise: what causes that arrested\r\ndevelopment?\r\n\r\nThe larva is born with the hope of flying at maturity. As a pledge of\r\nthat fair future, it carries on its back four sheaths in which the\r\nprecious germs lie slumbering. Everything is arranged according to the\r\nrules of normal evolution. Thereupon, suddenly, the organism does not\r\nfulfil its promises; it is false to its engagements; it leaves the\r\nadult insect without sails, leaves it with only useless rags.\r\n\r\nAre we to lay this nudity to the charge of the harsh conditions of\r\nAlpine life? Not at all, for the other hoppers, living on the same\r\ngrassy slopes, manage very well to achieve the wings foretold by the\r\nlarva’s rudiments.\r\n\r\nMen tell us that, from one attempt to another, from progress to\r\nprogress, under the stimulus of necessity, animals end by acquiring\r\nthis or that organ. No other creative intervention is accepted than\r\nthat of need. This, for instance, is the way in which the Locusts went\r\nto work, in particular those whom I see fluttering over the ridges of\r\nthe Ventoux. From their niggardly larval flaps they are supposed to\r\nhave extracted wings and wing-cases, by virtue of secret and mysterious\r\nlabours rendered fruitful by the centuries.\r\n\r\nVery well, O my illustrious masters! And now tell me, if you please,\r\nwhat reasons persuaded the Pedestrian Locust not to go beyond his rude\r\noutline of a flying-apparatus. He also, surely, must have felt the\r\nprick of necessity for ages and ages; during his laborious tumbles amid\r\nthe broken stones, he must have felt the advantage that it would be for\r\nhim to be relieved of his weight by means of wing-power; and all the\r\nendeavours of his organism, striving to achieve a better lot, have not\r\nyet succeeded in spreading bladewise his incipient wings.\r\n\r\nIf we accept your theories, under the same conditions of urgent\r\nnecessity, diet, climate and habits, some are successful and manage to\r\nfly, others fail and remain clumsy pedestrians. Short of resting\r\nsatisfied with words and passing off chalk for cheese, I abandon the\r\nexplanations offered. Sheer ignorance is far preferable, for it\r\nprejudges nothing.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave this backward one who is a stage behind his kinsmen,\r\nno one knows why. Anatomy has its throwbacks, its halts, its sudden\r\nleaps, all of which defy our curiosity. In the presence of the\r\nunfathomable problem of origins, the best thing is to bow in all\r\nhumility and pass on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE LOCUSTS: THEIR EGGS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can our Locusts do? Not much in the way of manufactures. Their\r\nbusiness in the world is that of alchemists who in their gourdlike\r\nstomach elaborate and refine material destined for higher objects. As I\r\nsit by my fireside, in the evening hours of meditation, scribbling\r\nthese notes upon the part which Locusts play in life, I am not prepared\r\nto say that they have not contributed from time to time to the\r\nawakening of thought, that magic mirror of things. They are on the\r\nearth to thrive as best they can and to multiply, the latter being the\r\nhighest law of animals charged with the manufacture of foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nFrom the former point of view, if we except the all-devouring tribes\r\nwhich at times imperil the very existence of Africa, the Locusts hardly\r\nattract our attention. They are poor trenchermen; and I can surfeit a\r\nwhole barrack-room in my cages with a leaf of lettuce. As for the way\r\nin which they multiply, that is another matter and one well worth a\r\nmoment’s attention.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we must not look for the nuptial eccentricities of the\r\nGrasshoppers. Despite close similarity of structure, we are here in a\r\nnew world as regards habits and character. In the peaceful Locust clan,\r\nall that has to do with pairing is correct, free from impropriety and\r\nconducted in accordance with the customary rites of the entomological\r\nworld. Any one keeping it under observation at the time of the\r\nprocreative frenzy will realize that the Locust came later than the\r\nGrasshopper, after the primitive Orthopteron had sown his monstrous\r\nwild oats. There is nothing striking to be said therefore on this\r\nalways delicate subject; and I am very glad of it. Let us pass on and\r\ncome to the eggs.\r\n\r\nAt the end of August, a little before noon-day, let us keep a close\r\nwatch on the Italian Locust (Caloptenus italicus, Lin.), the boldest\r\nhopper of my neighbourhood. He is a sturdy fellow, very free with his\r\nkicks; and he is clad in short wing-cases that hardly reach the tip of\r\nhis abdomen. His costume is usually russet, with brown patches. A few\r\nmore elegant ones edge the corselet with a whitish hem which is\r\nprolonged over the head and wing-cases. The wings are colourless except\r\nat the base, where they are pink; the hinder shins are claret-coloured.\r\n\r\nThe mother selects a suitable spot for her eggs on the side where the\r\nsun is hottest and always at the edge of the cage, whose wirework\r\nsupplies her with a support in case of need. Slowly and laboriously she\r\ndrives her clumsy drill perpendicularly into the sand, this drill being\r\nher abdomen, which disappears entirely. In the absence of proper\r\nboring-tools, the descent underground is painful and hesitating, but is\r\nat last accomplished thanks to perseverance, that powerful lever of the\r\nweak.\r\n\r\nThe mother is now installed, half-buried in the soil. She gives slight\r\nstarts, which follow one another at regular intervals and seem to\r\ncorrespond with the efforts of the oviduct as it expels the eggs. The\r\nneck gives throbs that lift and lower the head with slight jerks. Apart\r\nfrom these pulsations of the head, the body, in its only visible half,\r\nthe fore-part, is absolutely stationary, so intense is the creature’s\r\nabsorption in her laying. It is not unusual for a male, by comparison a\r\ndwarf, to come near and for a long time to gaze curiously at the\r\ntravailing mother. Sometimes also a few females stand around, with\r\ntheir big faces turned towards their friend in labour. They seem to\r\ntake an interest in what is happening, perhaps saying to themselves\r\nthat it will be their turn soon.\r\n\r\nAfter some forty minutes of immobility, the mother suddenly releases\r\nherself and bounds far away. She gives not a look at the eggs nor a\r\ntouch of the broom to conceal the aperture of the well. The hole closes\r\nof its own accord, as best it can, by the natural falling-in of the\r\nsand. It is an extremely summary performance, marked by an utter\r\nabsence of maternal solicitude. The Locust mother is not a model of\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nOthers do not forsake their eggs so recklessly. I can name the ordinary\r\nLocust with the blue wings striped with black (Œdipoda cœrulescens,\r\nLin.); also Pachytylus nigrofasciatus, De Geer, whose cognomen lacks\r\npoint, for it ought to suggest either the malachite-green patches of\r\nthe costume or the white cross of the corselet.\r\n\r\nBoth, when laying their eggs, adopt the same attitude as the Italian\r\nLocust. The abdomen is driven perpendicularly into the soil; the rest\r\nof the body partly disappears under the sliding sand. We again see a\r\nlong period of immobility, exceeding half an hour, together with little\r\njerks of the head, a sign of the underground efforts.\r\n\r\nThe two mothers at last release themselves. With their hind-legs,\r\nlifted on high, they sweep a little sand over the orifice of the pit\r\nand press it down by stamping rapidly. It is a pretty sight to watch\r\nthe precipitous action of their slender legs, blue or pink, giving\r\nalternate kicks to the opening which is waiting to be plugged. In this\r\nmanner, with a lively trampling, the entrance to the house is closed\r\nand hidden away. The hole in which the eggs were laid disappears from\r\nsight, so well obliterated that no evil-intentioned creature could hope\r\nto discover it by means of vision alone.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. The driving-power of the two rammers is the hinder\r\nthighs, which, in rising and falling, scrape lightly against the edge\r\nof the wing-cases. This bow-play produces a faint stridulation, similar\r\nto that with which the insect placidly lulls itself to sleep in the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nThe Hen salutes the egg which she has just laid with a song of\r\ngladness; she announces her maternal joys, to the whole neighbourhood.\r\nEven so does the Locust do in many cases. With her thin scraper, she\r\ncelebrates the advent of her family. She says:\r\n\r\n“Non omnis moriar; I have buried underground the treasure of the\r\nfuture; I have entrusted to the incubation of the great hatcher a keg\r\nof germs which will take my place.”\r\n\r\nEverything on the site of the nest is put right in one brief spell of\r\nwork. The mother then leaves the spot, refreshes herself after her\r\nexertions with a few mouthfuls of green stuff and prepares to begin\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the Acridians in our part of the country, the Grey\r\nLocust (Pachytylus cinerescens, Fabr.), rivals the African Locusts in\r\nsize, without possessing their calamitous habits. He is peace-loving\r\nand temperate and above reproach where the fruits of the earth are\r\nconcerned. From him we obtain a little information which is easily\r\nverified by observing the insect in captivity.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid about the end of April, a few days after the pairing,\r\nwhich lasts some little while. The female is armed at the tip of the\r\nabdomen—as, in varying degrees, are the other Locust mothers—with four\r\nshort excavators, arranged in pairs and shaped like a hooked\r\nfinger-nail. In the upper pair, which are larger, these hooks are\r\nturned upwards; in the lower and smaller pair, they are turned\r\ndownwards. They form a sort of claw and are hard and black at the\r\npoint; also they are scooped out slightly, like a spoon, on their\r\nconcave surface. These are the pick-axes, the trepans, the\r\nboring-tools.\r\n\r\nThe mother bends her long abdomen perpendicularly to the line of the\r\nbody. With her four trepans she bites into the soil, lifting the dry\r\nearth a little; then, with a very slow movement, she pushes down her\r\nabdomen, making no apparent effort, displaying no excitement that would\r\nreveal the difficulty of the task.\r\n\r\nThe insect is motionless and contemplative. The boring-implement could\r\nnot work more quietly if it were sinking into soft mould. It might all\r\nbe happening in butter; and yet what the bore traverses is caked,\r\nunyielding earth.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting, if it were only possible, to see the\r\nperforating-tool, the four gimlets, at work. Unfortunately, things\r\nhappen in the mysteries of the earth. No rubbish rises to the surface;\r\nnothing denotes the underground labour. Little by little the abdomen\r\nsinks softly in, as our finger would sink into a lump of soft clay. The\r\nfour trepans must open the passage, crumbling the earth into dust which\r\nis thrust back sideways by the abdomen and packed as with a gardener’s\r\ndibble.\r\n\r\nThe best site for laying the eggs is not always found at the first\r\nendeavour. I have seen the mother drive her abdomen right in and make\r\nfive wells one after the other before finding a suitable place. The\r\npits recognized as defective are abandoned as soon as bored. They are\r\nvertical, cylindrical holes, of the diameter of a thick lead-pencil and\r\nastonishingly neat. No wimble would produce cleaner work. Their length\r\nis that of the insect’s abdomen, distended as far as the extension of\r\nthe segments allows.\r\n\r\nAt the sixth attempt, the spot is recognized as propitious. The laying\r\nthereupon takes place, but nothing outside betrays the fact, so\r\nmotionless does the mother seem, with her abdomen immersed up to the\r\nhilt, which causes the long wings lying on the ground to rumple and\r\nopen out. The operation lasts for a good hour.\r\n\r\nAt last the abdomen rises, little by little. It is now near the\r\nsurface, in a favourable position for observation. The valves are in\r\ncontinual movement, whipping a mucus which sets in milk-white foam. It\r\nis very similar to the work done by the Mantis when enveloping her eggs\r\nin froth.\r\n\r\nThe foamy matter forms a nipple at the entrance to the well, a knob\r\nwhich stands well up and attracts the eye by the whiteness of its\r\ncolour against the grey background of the soil. It is soft and sticky,\r\nbut hardens pretty soon. When this closing button is finished, the\r\nmother moves away and troubles no more about her eggs, of which she\r\nlays a fresh batch elsewhere after a few days have intervened.\r\n\r\nAt other times, the terminal foamy paste does not reach the surface; it\r\nstops some way down and, before long, is covered with the sand that\r\nslips from the margin. There is then nothing outside to mark the place\r\nwhere the eggs were laid.\r\n\r\nEven when they concealed the mouth of the well under a layer of swept\r\nsand, my various captives, large and small, were too assiduously\r\nwatched by me to foil my curiosity. I know in every case the exact spot\r\nwhere the barrel of eggs lies. The time has come to inspect it.\r\n\r\nThe thing is easily discovered, an inch or an inch and a half down,\r\nwith the point of a knife. Its shape varies a good deal in the\r\ndifferent species, but the fundamental structure remains the same. It\r\nis always a sheath made of solidified foam, a similar foam to that of\r\nthe nests of the Praying Mantis. Grains of sand stuck together give it\r\na rough outer covering.\r\n\r\nThe mother has not actually made this coarse cover, which constitutes a\r\ndefensive wall. The mineral wrapper results from the simple\r\ninfiltration of the product, at first semifluid and viscous, that\r\naccompanies the emission of the eggs. The wall of the pocket absorbs it\r\nand, swiftly hardening, becomes a cemented scabbard, without the agency\r\nof any special labour on the insect’s part.\r\n\r\nInside, there is no foreign matter, nothing but foam and eggs. The\r\nlatter occupy only the lower portion, where they are immersed in a\r\nfrothy matrix and packed one on top of the other, slantwise. The upper\r\nportion, which is larger in some cases than in others, consists solely\r\nof soft, yielding foam. Because of the part which it plays when the\r\nyoung larvæ come into existence, I shall call it the ascending-shaft. A\r\nfinal point worthy of observation is that all the sheaths are planted\r\nmore or less vertically in the soil and end at the top almost level\r\nwith the ground.\r\n\r\nWe will now describe specifically the layings which we find in the\r\ncages. That of Pachytylus cinerescens is a cylinder six centimetres\r\nlong and eight millimetres wide. [82] The upper end, when it emerges\r\nabove the ground, swells into a nipple. All the rest is of uniform\r\nthickness. The yellow-grey eggs are fusiform. Immersed in the froth and\r\narranged slantwise, they occupy only about a sixth part of the total\r\nlength. The rest of the structure is a fine, white, very powdery foam,\r\nsoiled on the outside by grains of earth. The eggs are not many in\r\nnumber, about thirty; but the mother lays several batches.\r\n\r\nThat of P. nigrofasciatus is shaped like a slightly curved cylinder,\r\nrounded off at the lower end and cut square at the upper end. Its\r\ndimensions are an inch to an inch and a half in length by a fifth of an\r\ninch in width. The eggs, about twenty in number, are orange-red,\r\nadorned with a pretty pattern of tiny spots. The frothy matrix in which\r\nthey are contained is small in quantity; but above them there is a long\r\ncolumn of very fine, transparent and porous foam.\r\n\r\nThe Blue-winged Locust (Œdipoda cærulescens) arranges her eggs in a\r\nsort of fat inverted comma. The lower portion contains the eggs in its\r\ngourd-shaped pocket. They also are few in number, some thirty at most,\r\nof a fairly bright orange-red, but unspotted. This receptable is\r\ncrowned with a curved, conical cap of foam.\r\n\r\nThe lover of the mountain-tops, the Pedestrian Locust, adopts the same\r\nmethod as the Blue-winged Locust, the denizen of the plains. Her sheath\r\ntoo is shaped like a comma with the point turned upwards. The eggs,\r\nnumbering about two dozen, are dark-russet and are strikingly\r\nornamented with a delicate lacework of inwrought spots. You are quite\r\nsurprised when you pass the magnifying-glass over this unexpected\r\nelegance. Beauty leaves its impress everywhere, even in the humble\r\ncovering of an unsightly Acridian incapable of flight.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Locust begins by enclosing her eggs in a keg and then, when\r\non the point of sealing her receptacle, thinks better of it: something\r\nessential, the ascending-shaft, is lacking. At the upper end, at the\r\npoint where it seems as if the barrel ought to finish and close, a\r\nsudden compression changes the course of the work, which is prolonged\r\nby the regulation foamy appendage. In this way, two storeys are\r\nobtained, clearly defined on the outside by a deep groove. The lower,\r\nwhich is oval in shape, contains the packet of eggs; the upper,\r\ntapering into the tail of a comma, consists of nothing but foam. The\r\ntwo communicate by an opening that remains more or less free.\r\n\r\nThe Locust’s art is not confined to these specimens of architecture.\r\nShe knows how to construct other strong-boxes for her eggs; she can\r\nprotect them with all kinds of edifices, some simple, others more\r\ningenious, but all worthy of our attention. Those with which we are\r\nfamiliar are very few compared with those of which we are ignorant. No\r\nmatter: what the cages reveal to us is sufficient to enlighten us as to\r\nthe general form. It remains for us to learn how the building—an\r\negg-warehouse below, a foamy turret above—is constructed.\r\n\r\nDirect observation is impracticable here. If we took it into our heads\r\nto dig and to uncover the abdomen at work, the mother, worried by our\r\nimportunity, would leap away without telling us anything. Fortunately,\r\none Locust, the strangest of my district, reveals the secret to us. I\r\nspeak of the Tryxalis, the largest member of the family, after the Grey\r\nLocust.\r\n\r\nThough inferior to the last-named in size, how far she exceeds her in\r\nslenderness of figure and, above all, in originality of shape! On our\r\nsun-scorched swards, none has a leaping-apparatus to compare with hers.\r\nWhat hind-legs, what extravagant thighs, what shanks! They are longer\r\nthan the creature’s whole body.\r\n\r\nThe result obtained hardly corresponds with this extraordinary length\r\nof limb. The insect shuffles awkwardly along the edges of the vines, on\r\nthe sand sparsely covered with grass; it seems embarrassed by its\r\nshanks, which are slow to work. With this equipment, weakened by its\r\nexcessive length, the leap is awkward, describing but a short parabola.\r\nThe flight alone, once taken, is of a certain range, thanks to an\r\nexcellent pair of wings.\r\n\r\nAnd then what a strange head! It is an elongated cone, a sugar-loaf,\r\nwhose point, turned up in the air, has earned for the insect the quaint\r\nepithet of nasuta, long-nosed. At the top of this cranial promontory\r\nare two large, gleaming, oval eyes and two antennæ, flat and pointed,\r\nlike dagger-blades. These rapiers are organs of information. The\r\nTryxalis lowers them, with a sudden swoop, to explore with their points\r\nthe object in which she is interested, the bit which she intends to\r\nnibble.\r\n\r\nTo this abnormal shape we must add another characteristic that makes\r\nthis long-shanks an exception among Acridians. The ordinary Locusts, a\r\npeaceful tribe, live among themselves without strife, even when driven\r\nby hunger. The Tryxalis, on the other hand, is somewhat addicted to the\r\ncannibalism of the Grasshoppers. In my cages, in the midst of plenty,\r\nshe varies her diet and passes easily from salad to game. When tired of\r\ngreen stuff, she does not scruple to exercise her jaws on her weaker\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nThis is the creature capable of giving us information about methods of\r\nlaying. In my cages, as the result of an aberration due no doubt to the\r\nboredom of captivity, it has never laid its eggs in the ground. I have\r\nalways seen it operating in the open air and even perched on high. [83]\r\nIn the early days of October, the insect clings to the trelliswork of\r\nthe cage and very slowly discharges its batch of eggs, which we see\r\ngushing forth in a fine, foamy stream, soon stiffening into a thick\r\ncylindrical cord, knotty and queerly curved. It takes nearly an hour to\r\ncomplete the emission. Then the thing falls to the ground, no matter\r\nwhere, unheeded by the mother, who never troubles about it again.\r\n\r\nThe shapeless object, which varies greatly in different layings, is at\r\nfirst straw-coloured, then darkens and turns rusty-brown on the morrow.\r\nThe fore-part, which is the first ejected, usually consists only of\r\nfoam; the hinder part alone is fertile and contains the eggs, buried in\r\na frothy matrix. They are amber-yellow, about a score in number and\r\nshaped like blunt spindles, eight to nine millimetres in length. [84]\r\n\r\nThe sterile end, which is at least as big as the other, tells us that\r\nthe apparatus which produces the foam is in operation before the\r\noviduct and afterwards goes on while the latter is working.\r\n\r\nBy what mechanism does the Tryxalis froth up her viscous product into a\r\nporous column first and a mattress for the eggs afterwards? She must\r\ncertainly know the method of the Praying Mantis, who, with the aid of\r\nspoon-shaped valves, whips and beats her glair and converts it into an\r\nomelette soufflée; but in the Acridian’s case the frothing is done\r\nwithin and there is nothing outside to betray its existence. The glue\r\nis foamy from the moment of its appearing in the open air.\r\n\r\nIn the Mantis’ building, that complex work of art, it is not a case of\r\nany special talent, which the mother can exercise at will. The\r\nwonderful egg-casket comes from the ordinary action of the mechanism,\r\nis merely the outcome of the organization. A fortiori, the Tryxalis, in\r\ndischarging her clumsy sausage, is purely a machine. The thing happens\r\nof itself.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to the Locusts. They have no industry of their own\r\nspecially devised for laying eggs in strata in a keg of froth and\r\nextending this keg into an ascending-shaft. The mother, with her\r\nabdomen plunged into the sand, expels at the same time eggs and foamy\r\nglair. The whole becomes coordinated of its own accord simply by the\r\nmechanism of the organs: on the outside, the frothy material, which\r\ncoagulates and becomes encrusted with a bulwark of earth; in the centre\r\nand at the bottom, the eggs arranged in regular strata; at the upper\r\nend, a column of yielding foam.\r\n\r\nThe Tryxalis and the Grey Locust are early hatchers. The latter’s\r\nfamily are already hopping on the yellow patches of grass in August;\r\nbefore October is out, we are frequently coming across young larvæ with\r\npointed skulls. But in most of the other Acridians the ovigerous\r\nsheaths last through the winter and do not open until the fine weather\r\nreturns. They are buried at no great depth in a soil which is at first\r\nloose and dusty and which would not be likely to interfere with the\r\nemergence of the young larvæ if it remained as it is; but the winter\r\nrains cake it together and turn it into a hard ceiling. Suppose that\r\nthe hatching takes place only a couple of inches down: how is this\r\ncrust to be broken, how is the larva to come up from below? The\r\nmother’s unconscious art has provided for that.\r\n\r\nThe Locust at his birth finds above him, not rough sand and hardened\r\nearth, but a perpendicular tunnel whose solid walls keep all\r\ndifficulties at a distance, a road protected by a little\r\neasily-penetrated foam, an ascending-shaft, in short, which brings the\r\nnew-born larva quite close to the surface. Here a finger’s-breadth of\r\nserious obstacle remains to be overcome.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the emergence therefore is accomplished without\r\neffort, thanks to the terminal appendage of the egg-barrel. If, in my\r\ndesire to follow the underground work of the exodus, I experiment in\r\nglass tubes, almost all the new-born larvæ die, exhausted with fatigue,\r\nunder an inch of earth, when I do away with the liberating appendage to\r\nthe shells. They duly come to light if I leave the nest in its integral\r\ncondition, with the ascending-shaft pointing upwards. Though a\r\nmechanical product of the organism, created without any effort of the\r\ncreature’s intelligence, the Locust’s edifice, we must confess, is\r\nsingularly well thought out.\r\n\r\nHaving come quite close to the surface with the aid of his\r\nascending-shaft, what does the young Locust do to complete his\r\ndeliverance? He has still to pass through a layer of earth about a\r\nfinger’s-breadth in thickness; and that is very hard work for budding\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\nIf we keep the egg-cases in glass tubes during the favourable period,\r\nthe end of spring, we shall receive a reply to our question, provided\r\nthat we have the requisite patience. The Blue-winged Locusts lend\r\nthemselves best to my investigations. I find some of them busied with\r\nthe work of liberation at the end of June.\r\n\r\nThe little Locust, on leaving his shell, is a whitish colour, clouded\r\nwith light red. His progress is made by wormlike movements; and, so\r\nthat it may be impeded as little as possible, he is hatched in the\r\ncondition of a mummy, that is to say, clad, like the young\r\nGrasshoppers, in a temporary jacket, which keeps his antennæ, palpi and\r\nlegs closely fixed to his breast and belly. The head itself is very\r\nmuch bent. The large hind-thighs are arranged side by side with the\r\nfolded shanks, shapeless as yet, short and as it were crooked. On the\r\nway, the legs are slightly released; the hind-legs are straightened out\r\nand afford a fulcrum for the sapping-work.\r\n\r\nThe boring-tool, a repetition of the Grasshoppers’, is at the neck.\r\nThere is here a tumour that swells, subsides, throbs and strikes the\r\nobstacle with pistonlike regularity. A tiny and most tender cervical\r\nbladder engages in a struggle with quartz. At the sight of this capsule\r\nof glair striving to overcome the hardness of the mineral, I am seized\r\nwith pity. I come to the unhappy creature’s assistance by slightly\r\ndamping the layer to be passed through.\r\n\r\nDespite my intervention, the task is so arduous that, in an hour, I see\r\nthe indefatigable one make a progress of hardly a twenty-fifth of an\r\ninch. How you must labour, you poor little thing, how you must\r\npersevere with your throbbing head and writhing loins, before you can\r\nclear a passage for yourself through the thin layer which my kindly\r\ndrop of water has softened for you!\r\n\r\nThe ineffectual efforts of the tiny mite tell us plainly that the\r\nemergence into the light of day is an enormous undertaking, in which,\r\nbut for the aid of the exit-tunnel, the mother’s work, the greater\r\nnumber would succumb.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Grasshoppers, similarly equipped, find it even more\r\ndifficult to make their way out of the earth. Their eggs are laid naked\r\nin the ground; no outward passage is prepared for them beforehand. We\r\nmay assume, therefore, that the mortality must be very high among these\r\nimprovident ones; legions are bound to perish at the time of the\r\nexodus.\r\n\r\nThis is confirmed by the comparative scarcity of Grasshoppers and the\r\nextreme abundance of Locusts. And yet the number of eggs laid is about\r\nthe same in both cases. The Locust does not, in fact, limit herself to\r\na single casket containing a score of eggs: she puts into the ground\r\ntwo, three and more, which gives a total population approaching that of\r\nthe Decticus and other Grasshoppers. If, to the greater delight of the\r\nconsumers of small game, she thrives so well, whereas the Grasshopper,\r\nwho is quite as fertile but less ingenious, dwindles, does she not owe\r\nit to that superb invention, her exit-turret?\r\n\r\nOne last word upon the tiny insect which, for days on end, fights away\r\nwith its cervical rammer. It is outside at last and rests for a moment,\r\nto recover from all that fatigue. Then, suddenly, under the thrust of\r\nthe throbbing blister, the temporary jacket splits. The rags are pushed\r\nback by the hind-legs, which are the last to strip. The thing is done:\r\nthe creature is free, pale in colouring as yet, but possessing the\r\nfinal larval form.\r\n\r\nThen and there, the hind-legs, hitherto stretched in a straight line,\r\nadopt the regulation position; the legs fold under the great thighs;\r\nand the spring is ready to work. It works. Little Locust makes his\r\nentrance into the world and hops for the first time. I offer him a bit\r\nof lettuce the size of my finger-nail. He refuses. Before taking\r\nnourishment, he must first mature and develop for a while in the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE LOCUSTS: THE LAST MOULT\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just beheld a stirring sight: the last moult of a Locust, the\r\nextraction of the adult from his larval wrapper. It is magnificent. The\r\nobject of my enthusiasm is the Grey Locust, the giant among our\r\nAcridians, who is common on the vines at vintage-time, in September. On\r\naccount of his size—he is as long as my finger—he is a better subject\r\nfor observation than any other of his tribe.\r\n\r\nThe fat, ungraceful larva, a rough draft of the perfect insect, is\r\nusually pale-green; but some also are bluish-green, dirty-yellow,\r\nred-brown or even ashen-grey, like the grey of the adult. The corselet\r\nis strongly keeled and notched, with a sprinkling of fine white\r\nworm-holes. The hind-legs, powerful as those of mature age, have a\r\ngreat haunch striped with red and a long shank shaped like a two-edged\r\nsaw.\r\n\r\nThe wing-cases, which in a few days will project well beyond the tip of\r\nthe abdomen, are in their present state two skimpy, triangular pinions,\r\ntouching back to back along their upper edges and continuing the keel\r\nof the corselet. Their free ends stand up like a pointed gable. These\r\ntwo coat-tails, of which the material seems to have been clipped short\r\nwith ridiculous meanness, just cover the creature’s nakedness at the\r\nsmall of the back. They shelter two lean strips, the germs of the\r\nwings, which are even more exiguous. In brief, the sumptuous, slender\r\nsails of the near future are at present sheer rags, of such meagre\r\ndimensions as to be grotesque. What will come out of these miserable\r\nenvelopes? A marvel of stately elegance.\r\n\r\nLet us observe the proceedings in detail. Feeling itself ripe for\r\ntransformation, the creature clutches the trelliswork of the cage with\r\nits hinder and intermediary legs. The fore-legs are folded and crossed\r\nover the breast and are not employed in supporting the insect, which\r\nhangs in a reversed position, back downwards. The triangular pinions,\r\nthe sheaths of the wing-cases, open their peaked roof and separate\r\nsideways; the two narrow strips, the germs of the wings, stand in the\r\ncentre of the uncovered space and diverge slightly. The position for\r\nthe moult has now been taken with the necessary stability.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done is to burst the old tunic. Behind the\r\ncorselet, under the pointed roof of the prothorax, pulsations are\r\nproduced by alternate inflation and deflation. A similar operation is\r\nperformed in front of the neck and probably also under the entire\r\ncovering of the shell that is to be split. The delicacy of the\r\nmembranes at the joints enables us to perceive what is going on at\r\nthese bare points, but the harness of the corselet hides it from us in\r\nthe central portion.\r\n\r\nIt is there that the insect’s reserves of blood flow in waves. The\r\nrising tide expresses itself in blows of an hydraulic battering-ram.\r\nDistended by this rush of humours, by this injection wherein the\r\norganism concentrates its energies, the skin at last splits along a\r\nline of least resistance prepared by life’s subtle previsions. The\r\nfissure yawns all along the corselet, opening precisely over the keel,\r\nas though the two symmetrical halves had been soldered. Unbreakable any\r\nelsewhere, the wrapper yields at this median point which is kept weaker\r\nthan the rest. The split is continued some little way back and runs\r\nbetween the fastenings of the wings; it goes up the head as far as the\r\nbase of the antennæ, where it sends a short ramification to the right\r\nand left.\r\n\r\nThrough this break the back is seen, quite soft, pale, hardly tinged\r\nwith grey. Slowly it swells into a larger and larger hunch. At last it\r\nis wholly released. The head follows, extracted from its mask, which\r\nremains in its place, intact in the smallest particular, but looking\r\nstrange with its great glassy eyes that do not see. The sheaths of the\r\nantennæ, with not a wrinkle, with nothing out of order and with their\r\nnormal position unchanged, hang over this dead face, which is now\r\ntranslucent.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in emerging from their narrow sheaths, which enclosed them\r\nwith such absolute precision, the antennary threads encountered no\r\nresistance capable of turning their scabbards inside out, or disturbing\r\ntheir shape, or even wrinkling them. Without injuring the twisted\r\ncontainers, the contents, equal in size and themselves twisted, have\r\nmanaged to slip out as easily as a smooth, straight object would do, if\r\nsliding in a loose sheath. The extraction-mechanism will be still more\r\nremarkable in the case of the hind-legs.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it is the turn of the fore-legs and then of the intermediary\r\nlegs to shed armlets and gauntlets, always without the least rent,\r\nhowever small, without a crease of rumpled material, without a trace of\r\nany change in the natural position. The insect is now fixed to the top\r\nof the cage only by the claws of the long hind-legs. It hangs\r\nperpendicularly, head downwards, swinging like a pendulum, if I touch\r\nthe wire-gauze. Four tiny hooks are what it hangs by. If they gave way,\r\nif they became unfastened, the insect would be lost, for it is\r\nincapable of unfurling its enormous wings anywhere except in space. But\r\nthey will hold: life, before withdrawing from them, left them stiff and\r\nsolid, so as to be able firmly to support the struggles that are to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThe wing-cases and wings now emerge. These are four narrow strips,\r\nfaintly grooved and looking like bits of paper ribbon. At this stage,\r\nthey are scarcely a quarter of their final length. So limp are they\r\nthat they bend under their own weight and sprawl along the insect’s\r\nsides in the opposite direction to the normal. Their free end, which\r\nshould be turned backwards, now points towards the head of the Locust,\r\nwho is hanging upside down. Imagine four blades of thick grass, bent\r\nand battered by a rainstorm, and you will have a fair picture of the\r\npitiable bunch formed by the future organs of flight.\r\n\r\nIt must be no light task to bring things to the requisite stage of\r\nperfection. The deeper-seated changes are already well-started,\r\nsolidifying liquid mucilages, bringing order out of chaos; but so far\r\nnothing outside betrays what is happening in that mysterious laboratory\r\nwhere everything seems lifeless.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the hind-legs become released. The great thighs appear in\r\nview, tinted on their inner surface with a pale pink, which will soon\r\nturn into a streak of bright crimson. The emergence is easy, the bulky\r\nhaunch clearing the way for the tapering knuckle.\r\n\r\nIt is different with the shank. This, in the adult insect, bristles\r\nthroughout its length with a double row of hard, pointed spikes.\r\nMoreover, the lower extremity ends in four large spurs. It is a genuine\r\nsaw, but with two parallel sets of teeth and so powerful that, if we\r\ndismiss the size from our minds, it might be compared with the rough\r\nsaw wielded by a quarryman.\r\n\r\nThe larva’s shin is similarly constructed, so that the object to be\r\nextracted is contained in a sheath as awkwardly shaped as itself. Each\r\nspur is enclosed in a similar spur, each tooth fits into the hollow of\r\na similar tooth; and the moulding is so exact that we should obtain no\r\nmore intimate contact if, instead of the envelope waiting to be shed,\r\nwe coated the limb with a layer of varnish distributed uniformly with a\r\nfine brush.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the sawlike tibia slips out of its long, narrow case\r\nwithout catching in it at any point whatever. If I had not seen this\r\nhappen over and over again, I could never have believed it: the\r\ndiscarded legging is quite intact all the way down. Neither the\r\nterminal spurs nor the two rows of spikes have caught in the delicate\r\nmould. The saw has respected the dainty scabbard which a puff of my\r\nbreath is enough to tear; the formidable rake has slipped through\r\nwithout leaving the least scratch behind it.\r\n\r\nI was far from expecting such a result as this. Because of the spiked\r\narmour, I imagined that the leg would strip in scales which came loose\r\nof themselves or yielded to rubbing, like dead cuticle. How greatly did\r\nthe reality exceed my expectations!\r\n\r\nFrom the spurs and spikes of the infinitely thin matrix there emerge\r\nspurs and spikes that make the leg capable of cutting soft wood. This\r\nis done without violence or the least inconvenience; and the discarded\r\ngarment remains where it is, hanging by the claws to the top of the\r\ncage, uncreased and untorn. The magnifying-glass shows not a trace of\r\nrough usage. As the thing was before the excoriation, so it remains\r\nafterwards. The legging of dead skin continues, down to the pettiest\r\ndetails, an exact replica of the live leg.\r\n\r\nIf any one suggested that we should extract a saw from some sort of\r\ngoldbeater’s-skin sheath which had been exactly moulded on the steel\r\nand that we should perform the operation without producing the least\r\ntear, we should burst out laughing: the thing is so flagrantly\r\nimpossible. Life makes light of these impossibilities; it has methods\r\nof realizing the absurd, in case of need. And the Locust’s leg tells us\r\nso.\r\n\r\nIf the saw of the shin were as hard as it is once it leaves its sheath,\r\nit would absolutely refuse to come out without tearing to pieces the\r\ntight-fitting scabbard. The difficulty therefore is evaded, for it is\r\nessential that the leggings, which form the only suspension-cords,\r\nshould remain intact in order to furnish a firm support until the\r\ndeliverance is completed.\r\n\r\nThe leg in process of liberation is not a limb fit for walking; it has\r\nnot the rigidity which it will presently possess. It is soft and highly\r\nflexible. In the portion which the progress of the moult exposes to\r\nview, I see it bending and curving as I wish, under the mere influence\r\nof its own weight, when I lift the cage. It is as supple as elastic\r\ncord. And yet consolidation follows very rapidly, for the proper\r\nstiffness will be acquired in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nFarther on, in the part hidden from me by the sheath, the leg is\r\ncertainly softer and in a state of exquisite plasticity—I was almost\r\nsaying fluidity—which allows it to overcome difficult passages almost\r\nas a liquid would flow.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of the saw are there, but have none of their future\r\nsharpness. I am able to strip a leg partially with the point of a knife\r\nand to extract the spines from their horny mould. They are germs of\r\nspikes, flexible buds which bend under the slightest pressure and\r\nresume their upright position as soon as the pressure is removed.\r\n\r\nThese spikes lie backwards when the leg is about to be drawn out; they\r\nstand up again and solidify while it emerges. I am witnessing not the\r\nmere stripping of gaiters from limbs completely enclosed, but rather a\r\nsort of birth and growth which disconcert us by their rapidity.\r\n\r\nMuch in the same way, but with far less delicate precision, do the\r\nclaws of the Crayfish, at moulting-time, withdraw the soft flesh of\r\ntheir two fingers from the old stony sheath.\r\n\r\nThe shanks are free at last. They are folded limply in the groove of\r\nthe thigh, there to mature without moving. The abdomen is next\r\nstripped. Its fine tunic wrinkles, rumples and pushes back towards the\r\nextremity, which alone for some time longer remains clad in the\r\nmoulting skin. Except at this point, the whole of the Locust is now\r\nbare.\r\n\r\nIt is hanging perpendicularly, head down, supported by the claws of the\r\nnow empty leggings. Throughout this long and finikin work, the four\r\ntalons have never yielded, thanks to the delicacy and care with which\r\nthe extraction has been conducted.\r\n\r\nThe insect, fixed by the stern to its cast skin, does not move. Its\r\nabdomen is immensely swollen, apparently distended by the reserve of\r\norganizable humours which the expansion of the wings and wing-cases\r\nwill soon set in motion. The Locust is resting; he is recovering from\r\nhis exertions. Twenty minutes are spent in waiting.\r\n\r\nThen, by an effort of its back, the hanging insect raises itself and\r\nwith its front tarsi grabs hold of the cast skin fastened above it.\r\nNever did acrobat, swinging by his feet from the bar of a trapeze,\r\ndisplay greater strength of loin in lifting himself. When this feat is\r\naccomplished, what remains to be done is nothing. With the support\r\nwhich he has now gripped, the Locust climbs a little higher and reaches\r\nthe wire gauze of the cage. This takes the place of the brushwood which\r\nthe free insect would utilize for the transformation. He fixes himself\r\nto it with his four front feet. Then the tip of the abdomen succeeds in\r\nreleasing itself, whereupon, loosened with one last shake, the empty\r\nhusk drops to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe fact of its falling interests me, for I remember the stubborn\r\npersistency with which the Cicada’s cast skin defies the winter winds\r\nwithout being detached from its supporting twig. The Locust’s\r\ntransfiguration is conducted in much the same way as the Cicada’s. Then\r\nhow is it that the Acridian gives himself such very shaky hangers? The\r\nhooks hold so long as the work of tearing continues, though one would\r\nthink that this ought to bring down everything; they give way under a\r\ntrifling shock so soon as that work is done. We have, therefore, a very\r\nunstable condition of equilibrium here, showing once more with what\r\ndelicate precision the insect leaves its sheath.\r\n\r\nI said “tearing,” for want of a better word. But it is not quite that.\r\nThe term implies violence; and violence there cannot be any, because of\r\nthe unsteady balance. Should the Locust, upset by his exertions, come\r\nto the ground, it would be all up with him. He would shrivel where he\r\nlies; or, at any rate, his organs of flight, being unable to expand,\r\nwould remain pitiful shreds. The Locust does not tear himself loose; he\r\nflows softly from his scabbard. It is as though he were forced out by a\r\ngentle spring.\r\n\r\nTo return to the wings and wing-cases, which have made no apparent\r\nprogress since leaving the sheaths. They are still stumps, with fine\r\nlongitudinal seams, not much more than bits of rope. Their expansion,\r\nwhich will take more than three hours, is reserved for the end, when\r\nthe insect is completely stripped and in its normal position.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the Locust turn head uppermost. This upright position is\r\nenough to restore the natural arrangement of the wing-cases and wings.\r\nBeing extremely flexible and bent by their own weight, they were\r\nhanging down with their loose end pointing towards the head of the\r\ninverted insect. Now, still by virtue of their own weight, they are\r\nstraightened and put the right way up. They are no longer curved like\r\nthe petals of a flower, they are no longer in an inverted position; but\r\nthey still look miserably insignificant.\r\n\r\nIn its perfect state, the wing is fan-shaped. A radiating cluster of\r\nstrong nervures runs through it lengthwise and forms the framework of\r\nthe fan, which is readily furled or unfurled. The intervening spaces\r\nare crossed by innumerable tiny bars which make of the whole a network\r\nof rectangular meshes. The wing-case, which is coarser and much less\r\nexpanded, repeats this structure in squares.\r\n\r\nIn neither case does any of the mesh show during the rope’s-end stage.\r\nAll that we see is a few wrinkles, a few winding furrows, which tell us\r\nthat the stumps are bundles of cunningly folded material reduced to\r\ntheir smallest volume.\r\n\r\nThe expansion begins near the shoulder. Where at first nothing definite\r\nwas to be distinguished, we soon see a diaphanous area subdivided into\r\nmeshes of exquisite precision. Little by little, with a slowness that\r\ndefies observation even through the magnifying-glass, this area\r\nincreases in extent at the expense of the shapeless terminal roll. My\r\neyes linger in vain on the confines of the two portions, the roll\r\ndeveloping and the gauze already developed: I see nothing, see no more\r\nthan I should see in a sheet of water. But wait a moment; and the\r\ntissue of squares stands out with perfect clearness.\r\n\r\nIf we judged only by this first examination, we should really think\r\nthat an organizable fluid is abruptly congealing into a network of\r\nnervures; we should imagine that we were in the presence of a\r\ncrystallization similar, in its suddenness, to that of a saline\r\nsolution on the slide of a microscope. Well, no: things cannot be\r\nactually happening like that. Life does not perform its tasks so\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\nI detach a half-developed wing and turn the powerful eye of the\r\nmicroscope upon it. This time I am satisfied. On the confines where the\r\nnetwork seemed to be gradually woven, that network was really in\r\nexistence. I can plainly see the longitudinal nervures, already thick\r\nand strong; and I can also see, pale, it is true, and without relief,\r\nthe cross-bars. I find them all in the terminal roll, of which I\r\nsucceed in unfolding a few strips.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious. The wing is not at this moment a fabric on the loom,\r\nthrough which the procreative energies are driving their shuttle; it is\r\na fabric already completed. All that it lacks to be perfect is\r\nexpansion and stiffness, even as our linen needs only starching and\r\nironing.\r\n\r\nThe flattening out is finished in three hours or more. The wings and\r\nwing-cases stand up on the Locust’s back like a huge set of sails,\r\nsometimes colourless, sometimes pale-green, as are the Cicada’s wings\r\nat the beginning. We are amazed at their size when we think of the\r\npaltry bundles that represented them at first. How did so much stuff\r\nmanage to find room there!\r\n\r\nThe fairy-tales tell us of a grain of hemp-seed that contained the\r\nunderlinen of a princess. Here is a grain that is even more\r\nastonishing. The one in the story took years and years to sprout and\r\nmultiply and at last to yield the quantity of hemp required for the\r\ntrousseau; the Locust’s supplies a sumptuous set of sails in a short\r\nspace of time.\r\n\r\nSlowly the proud crest, standing erect in four straight blades,\r\nacquires consistency and colour. The latter turns the requisite shade\r\non the following day. For the first time the wings fold like a fan and\r\nlie in their places; the wing-cases lower their outer edge and form a\r\ngutter which falls over the sides. The transformation is finished. All\r\nthat remains for the big Locust to do is to harden his tissues still\r\nfurther and to darken the grey of his costume while revelling in the\r\nsun. Let us leave him to enjoy himself and retrace our steps a little.\r\n\r\nThe four stumps, which issued from their sheaths shortly after the\r\ncorselet split its keel down the middle, contain, as we have seen, the\r\nwings and wing-cases, with their network of nervures. This network, if\r\nnot perfect, has at least the general plan of its numberless details\r\nmapped out. To unfurl these poor bundles and convert them into generous\r\nsails, it is enough that the organism, acting in this case like a\r\nforcing-pump, should shoot a stream of humours, which have been kept in\r\nreserve for this moment, the hardest of all, into the little channels\r\nalready prepared for their reception. With the channel marked out in\r\nadvance, a slight injection is sufficient to explain the rapid spread.\r\n\r\nBut what were the four strips of gauze while still contained in their\r\nsheaths? Are the wings spatules and the three-cornered pinions of the\r\nlarva moulds whose creases, corners and sinuosities shape their\r\ncontents in their own image and weave the tissues of the future wing\r\nand wing-case? If we had to do with a real instance of moulding, our\r\nbrains could call a halt. We should say to ourselves that it was quite\r\nsimple for the thing moulded to correspond with the shape of the mould.\r\nBut our halt would be short-lived, for the mould in its turn would want\r\nexplaining: we should have to seek for a solution of its infinite\r\nintricacies. Let us not go so far back; we should be utterly in the\r\ndark. Let us rather keep to facts that can be observed.\r\n\r\nI examine through the magnifying-glass a pinion of a larva ripe for\r\ntransformation. I see a bundle of fairly thick nervures radiating\r\nfanwise. Other nervures, paler and finer, are set in the intermediate\r\nspaces. Lastly, the fabric is completed by a number of very short\r\ntransversal lines, more delicate still and chevron-shaped.\r\n\r\nThis, no doubt, gives a rough outline of the future wing-case; but how\r\ndifferent from the mature structure! The arrangement of the radiating\r\nnervures, the skeleton of the edifice, is not at all the same; the\r\nnetwork formed by the transversal veins in no way suggests the\r\ncomplicated pattern which we shall see later. The rudimentary is about\r\nto be succeeded by the infinitely complex, the crude by the exquisitely\r\nperfect. The same remark applies to the wing-spatule and its outcome,\r\nthe final wing.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident, when we have the preparatory and the ultimate\r\nstage before our eyes at the same time: the larva’s pinion is not\r\nmerely a mould which elaborates the material in its own image and\r\nshapes the wing-case upon the model of its hollow. No, the membrane\r\nwhich we are expecting is not yet inside in the form of a bundle which,\r\nwhen unfurled, will astonish us with the size and the extreme\r\ncomplexity of its texture. Or, to be accurate, it is there, but in a\r\npotential state. Before becoming a real thing, it is a virtual thing,\r\nwhich is nothing as yet, but which is capable of becoming something. It\r\nis there just as much as the oak is inside its acorn.\r\n\r\nA fine, transparent rim binds the free edge both of the embryo wing and\r\nthe embryo wing-case. Under a powerful lens we can see a few uncertain\r\noutlines of the future lacework. This might well be the factory in\r\nwhich life intends to set its materials going. There is nothing else\r\nvisible, nothing to suggest the prodigious network whose every mesh\r\nwill shortly have its form and place determined for it with geometrical\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\nThere must therefore be something better and greater than a mould to\r\nmake the organizable matter shape itself into a sheet of gauze and\r\ndescribe the inextricable labyrinth of the nervation. There is a\r\nprimary plan, an ideal pattern which assigns to each atom its precise\r\nplace. Before the matter begins to move, the configuration is already\r\nvirtually traced, the courses of the plastic currents are already\r\nmarked out. The stones of our buildings are arranged in accordance with\r\nthe architect’s considered plan; they form an ideal assemblage before\r\nexisting as a real assemblage. Similarly, a Locust’s wing, that\r\nsumptuous piece of lace emerging from a miserable sheath, speaks to us\r\nof another Architect, the Author of the plans which life must follow in\r\nits labours.\r\n\r\nThe genesis of living creatures offers to our contemplation, in an\r\ninfinity of ways, marvels far greater than those of the Acridian; but\r\ngenerally they pass unperceived, overshadowed as they are by the veil\r\nof time. The lapse of years, with its slow mysteries, robs us of the\r\nmost astonishing spectacles, unless our minds be endowed with a\r\nstubborn patience. Here, by exception, things take place with a\r\nswiftness that arrests even a wavering attention.\r\n\r\nHe who would, without wearisome delays, catch a glimpse of the\r\ninconceivable dexterity with which life does its work has but to go to\r\nthe great Locust of the vines. The insect will show him that which,\r\nwith their extreme slowness, the sprouting seed, the budding leaf and\r\nthe blossoming flower hide from our curiosity. We cannot see a blade of\r\ngrass grow; but we can easily witness the growth of a Locust’s wings\r\nand wing-cases.\r\n\r\nWe stand astounded at this sublime phantasmagoria of a grain of\r\nhemp-seed which in a few hours becomes a superb piece of linen. What a\r\nproud artist is life, driving its shuttle to weave the wings of a\r\nLocust, one of those insignificant insects of which Pliny, long ago\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n   “In his tam parvis, fere nullis, quæ vis, quæ sapientia, quam\r\n    inextricabilis perfectis!”\r\n\r\n\r\nHow well the old naturalist was inspired on this occasion! Let us\r\nrepeat after him:\r\n\r\n“What power, what wisdom, what indescribable perfection in the tiny\r\ncorner of life which the Locust of the vines has shown us!”\r\n\r\nI have heard that a learned enquirer, to whom life was but a conflict\r\nof physical and chemical forces, did not despair of one day obtaining\r\nartificial organizable matter: protoplasm, as the official jargon has\r\nit. Were it in my power, I should hasten to satisfy this ambitious\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nVery well, be it so: you have thoroughly prepared your protoplasm. By\r\ndint of long hours of meditation, deep study, scrupulous care and\r\ninexhaustible patience, your wishes have been fulfilled; you have\r\nextracted from your apparatus an albuminous glair, which goes bad\r\neasily and stinks like the very devil in a few days’ time: in short,\r\nfilth. What do you propose to do with your product?\r\n\r\nWill you organize it? Will you give it the structure of a living\r\nedifice? Will you take a hypodermic syringe and inject it between two\r\nimpalpable films to obtain were it only the wing of a Gnat?\r\n\r\nFor that is more or less what the Locust does. He injects his\r\nprotoplasm between the two scales of the pinion; and the material\r\nbecomes a wing-case, because it finds as a guide the ideal archetype of\r\nwhich I spoke just now. It is controlled in its intricate windings by a\r\nplan which existed before the injection, before the material itself.\r\n\r\nHave you this archetype, this coordinator of forms, this primordial\r\nregulator, at the end of your syringe? No? Then throw away your\r\nproduct! No life will ever spring from that chemical ordure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE FOAMY CICADELLA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April, when the Swallow and the Cuckoo visit us, let us consider the\r\nfields for a while, keeping our eyes on the ground, as befits the eager\r\nobserver of insect-life. We shall not fail to see, here and there, on\r\nthe grass, little masses of white foam. It might easily be taken for a\r\nspray of frothy spittle from the lips of a passer-by; but there is so\r\nmuch of it that we soon abandon this first idea. Never would human\r\nsaliva suffice for so lavish an expenditure of foam, even if some one\r\nwith nothing better to do were to devote all his disgusting and\r\nmisdirected zeal to the effort.\r\n\r\nWhile recognizing that man is blameless in the matter, the northern\r\npeasant has not relinquished the name suggested by the appearance: he\r\ncalls those strange flakes “Cuckoo-spit,” after the bird whose note is\r\nthen proclaiming the awakening of spring. The vagrant creature, unequal\r\nto the toils and delights of housekeeping, ejects it at random, so they\r\nsay, as it pays its flying visits to the homes of others, in search of\r\na resting-place for its egg.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation does credit to the Cuckoo’s salivary powers, but not\r\nto the interpreter’s intelligence. The other popular denomination is\r\nworse still: “Frog-spit!” My dear good people, what on earth has the\r\nFrog or his slaver to do with it? [85]\r\n\r\nThe shrewder Provençal peasant also knows that vernal foam; but he is\r\ntoo cautious to give it any wild names. My rustic neighbours, when I\r\nask them about Cuckoo-spit and Frog-spit, begin to smile and see\r\nnothing in those words but a poor joke. To my questions on the nature\r\nof the thing they reply:\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\nExactly! That’s the sort of answer I like, an answer not complicated\r\nwith grotesque explanations.\r\n\r\nWould you know the real perpetrator of this spittle? Rummage about the\r\nfrothy mass with a straw. You will extract a little yellow,\r\npot-bellied, dumpy creature, shaped like a Cicada without wings. That’s\r\nthe foam-producer.\r\n\r\nWhen laid naked on another leaf, she brandishes the pointed tip of her\r\nlittle round paunch. This at once betrays the curious machine which we\r\nshall see at work presently. When older and still operating under the\r\ncover of its foam, the little thing becomes a nymph, turns green in\r\ncolour and gives itself stumps of wings fixed scarfwise on its sides.\r\nFrom underneath its blunted head there projects, when it is working, a\r\nlittle gimlet, a beak similar to that of the Cicadæ.\r\n\r\nIn its adult form the insect is, in fact, a sort of very small-sized\r\nCicada, for which reason the entomologist capable of shaking off the\r\ntrammels of nonsensical nomenclature calls it simply the Foamy\r\nCicadella. For this euphonic name, the diminutive of Cicada, the others\r\nhave substituted that horrible word Aphrophora. Orthodox science says,\r\nAphrophora spumaria, meaning Foamy Foambearer. The ear is none the\r\nbetter for this improvement. Let us content ourselves with Cicadella,\r\nwhich respects the tympanum and does not reduplicate the foam.\r\n\r\nI have consulted my few books as to the habits of the Cicadella. They\r\ntell me that she punctures plants and makes the sap exude in foamy\r\nflakes. Under this cover, the insect lives sheltered from the heat. A\r\nwork recently compiled has one curious piece of information: it tells\r\nme that I must get up early in the morning, inspect my crops, pick any\r\ntwig with foam on it and at once plunge it into a cauldron of boiling\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nOh, my poor Cicadella, this is a bad look-out! The author does not do\r\nthings by halves. I see him rising before the dawn, lighting a stove on\r\nwheels and pushing his infernal contrivance through the midst of his\r\nlucern, his clover and his peas, to boil you on the spot. He will have\r\nhis work cut out for him. I remember a certain patch of sainfoin of\r\nwhich almost every stalk had its foam-flakes. Had the stewing-process\r\nbeen necessary, one might just as well have reaped the field and turned\r\nthe whole crop into herb-tea.\r\n\r\nWhy these violent measures? Are you so very dangerous to the harvest,\r\nmy pretty little Cicada? They accuse you of draining the plant which\r\nyou attack. Upon my word, they are right: you drain it almost as dry as\r\nthe Flea does the Dog. But to touch another’s grass—you know it:\r\ndoesn’t the fable say so?—is a heinous crime, an offence which can be\r\npunished by nothing less drastic than boiling water.\r\n\r\nLet us waste no more time on these agricultural entomologists with\r\ntheir murderous designs. To hear them talk, one would think that the\r\ninsect has no right to live. Incapable of behaving like a ferocious\r\nlandowner who becomes filled with thoughts of massacre at the sight of\r\na maggoty plum, I, more kindly, abandon my few rows of peas and beans\r\nto the Cicadella: she will leave me my share, I am convinced.\r\n\r\nBesides, the insignificant ones of the earth are not the least rich in\r\ntalent, in an originality of invention which will teach us much\r\nconcerning the infinite variety of instinct. The Cicadella, in\r\nparticular, possesses her recipes for aerated waters. Let us ask her by\r\nwhat process she succeeds in giving such a fine head of froth to her\r\nproduct, for the books that talk about boiling cauldrons and\r\nCuckoo-spit are silent on this subject, the only one worthy of\r\nnarration.\r\n\r\nThe foamy mass has no very definite shape and is hardly larger than a\r\nhazel-nut. It is remarkably persistent even when the insect is not\r\nworking at it any longer. Deprived of its manufacturer, who would not\r\nfail to keep it going, and placed on a watch-glass, it lasts for more\r\nthan twenty-four hours without evaporating or losing its bubbles. This\r\npersistency is striking, compared with the rapidity with which\r\nsoapsuds, for instance, disappear.\r\n\r\nProlonged duration of the foam is necessary to the Cicadella, who would\r\nexhaust herself in the constant renewal of her products if her work\r\nwere ordinary froth. Once the effervescent covering is obtained, it is\r\nessential that the insect should rest for a time, with no other task\r\nthan to drink its fill and grow. And so the moisture converted into\r\nfroth possesses a certain stickiness, conducive to longevity. It is\r\nslightly oily and trickles under one’s finger like a weak solution of\r\ngum.\r\n\r\nThe bubbles are small and even, being all of the same dimensions. You\r\ncan see that they have been scrupulously gauged, one by one; you\r\nsuspect the presence of a graduated tube. Like our chemists and\r\ndruggists, the insect must have its drop-measures.\r\n\r\nA single Cicadella is usually crouching invisible in the depths of the\r\nfoam; sometimes there are two or three or more. In such cases, it is a\r\nfortuitous association, the fabrics of the several workers being so\r\nclose together that they merge into one common edifice.\r\n\r\nLet us see the work begin and, with the aid of a magnifying-glass,\r\nfollow the creature’s proceedings. With her sucker inserted up to the\r\nhilt and her six short legs firmly fixed, the Cicadella remains\r\nmotionless, flat on her stomach on the long-suffering leaf. You expect\r\nto see froth issuing from the edge of the well, effervescing under the\r\naction of the insect’s implement, whose lancets, ascending and\r\ndescending in turns and rubbing against each other like those of the\r\nCicada, ought to make the sap foam as it is forced out. The froth, so\r\nit would seem, must come ready-made from the puncture. That is what the\r\ncurrent descriptions of the Cicadella tell us; that was how I myself\r\npictured it on the authority of the writers. All this is a huge\r\nmistake: the real thing is much more ingenious. It is a very clear\r\nliquid that comes up from the well, with no more trace of foam than in\r\na dew-drop. Even so the Cicada, who possesses similar tools, makes the\r\nspot at which she slakes her thirst give forth a limpid fluid, with not\r\na vestige of froth to it. Therefore, notwithstanding its dexterity in\r\nsucking up liquids, the Cicadella’s mouth-apparatus has nothing to do\r\nwith the manufacture of the foamy mattress. It supplies the raw\r\nmaterial; another implement works it up. What implement? Have patience\r\nand we shall see.\r\n\r\nThe clear liquid rises imperceptibly and glides under the insect, which\r\nat last is half inundated. The work begins again without delay. To make\r\nwhite of egg into a froth we have two methods: we can whip it, thus\r\ndividing the sticky fluid into thin flakes and causing it to take in\r\nair in a network of cells; or we can blow into it and so inject\r\nair-bubbles right into the mass. Of these two methods, the Cicadella\r\nemploys the second, which is less violent and more elegant. She blows\r\nher froth.\r\n\r\nBut how is the blowing done? The insect seems incapable of it, being\r\ndevoid of any air-mechanism similar to that of the lungs. To breathe\r\nwith tracheæ and to blow like a bellows are incompatible actions.\r\n\r\nAgreed; but be sure that, if the insect needs a blast of air for its\r\nmanufactures, the blowing-machine will be there, most ingeniously\r\ncontrived. This machine the Cicadella possesses at the tip of her\r\nabdomen, at the end of the intestine. Here, split lengthwise in the\r\nshape of a Y, a little pocket opens and shuts in turns, a pocket whose\r\ntwo lips close hermetically when joined.\r\n\r\nHaving said this, let us watch the performance. The insect lifts the\r\ntip of its abdomen out of the bath in which it is swimming. The pocket\r\nopens, sucks in the air of the atmosphere till it is full, then closes\r\nand dives down, the richer by its prize. Inside the liquid, the\r\napparatus contracts. The captive air escapes as from a nozzle and\r\nproduces a first bubble of froth. Forthwith the air-pocket returns to\r\nthe upper air, opens, takes in a fresh load and goes down again closed,\r\nto immerse itself once more and blow in its gas. A new bubble is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nAnd so it goes on with chronometrical regularity, from second to\r\nsecond, the blowing-machine swinging upwards to open its valve and fill\r\nitself with air, downwards to dive into the liquid and send out its\r\ngaseous contents. Such is the air-measurer, the drop-glass which\r\naccounts for the evenness of the frothy bubbles.\r\n\r\nUlysses, the favourite of the gods, received from the storm-dispenser,\r\nÆolus, bags in which the winds were confined. The carelessness of his\r\ncrew, who untied the bags to find out what they contained, let loose a\r\ntempest which destroyed the fleet. I have seen those mythological\r\nwind-filled bags; I saw them years ago, when I was a child.\r\n\r\nA peripatetic tinker, a son of Calabria, had set up between two stones\r\nthe crucible in which a tin soup-tureen and plates were to be remelted.\r\nÆolus did the blowing, Æolus in the person of a little dark-skinned boy\r\nwho, squatting on his heels, forced air towards the forge by\r\nalternately squeezing two goatskin bags, one on the right and one on\r\nthe left. Thus must the prehistoric bronze-smelters have performed\r\ntheir task, they whose workshops and whose remains of copper-slag I\r\nfind on the hills near my home: the blast of their furnaces was\r\nproduced by these inflated skins.\r\n\r\nThe machine employed by my Æolus is pathetically simple. The hide of a\r\ngoat, with the hair left on, is practically all that is necessary. It\r\nis a bag fastened at the bottom over a nozzle, open at the top and\r\nsupplied, by way of lips, with two little boards which, when brought\r\ntogether, close up the whole apparatus. These two stiff lips are each\r\nfurnished with a leather handle, one for the thumb, the other for the\r\nfour remaining fingers. The hand opens; the lips of the bag part and it\r\nfills with air. The hand closes and brings the boards together; the air\r\nimprisoned in the compressed bag escapes by the nozzle. The alternate\r\nworking of the two bags gives a continuous blast.\r\n\r\nApart from continuity, which is not a favourable condition when the gas\r\nhas to be discharged in small bubbles, the Cicadella’s bellows works\r\nlike the Calabrian tinker’s. It is a flexible pocket with stiff lips,\r\nwhich alternately part and unite, opening to let the air enter and\r\nclosing to keep it imprisoned. The contraction of the sides takes the\r\nplace of the shrinking of the bag and puffs out the gaseous contents\r\nwhen the pocket is immersed.\r\n\r\nHe certainly had a lucky inspiration who first thought of confining the\r\nwind in a bag, as mythology tells us that Æolus did. The goatskin\r\nturned into a bellows gave us our metals, the essential matter whereof\r\nour tools are made. Well, in this art of expelling air, an enormous\r\nsource of progress, the Cicadella was the pioneer. She was blowing her\r\nfroth before Tubalcain thought of urging the fire of his forge with a\r\nleather pouch. She was the first to invent bellows.\r\n\r\nWhen, bubble by bubble, the foamy wrapper covers the insect to a height\r\nwhich the uplifted tip of her belly is unable to reach, it is no longer\r\npossible to take in air and the effervescence stops. Nevertheless, the\r\ngimlet that extracts the sap goes on working, for nourishment must be\r\nobtained. As a rule then, in the sloping part, the superfluous liquid,\r\nthat which is not converted into foam, collects and forms a drop of\r\nperfectly clear liquid.\r\n\r\nWhat does this limpid fluid lack in order to turn white and effervesce?\r\nNothing but air blown into it, one would think. I am able to substitute\r\nmy own devices for the Cicadella’s syringe. I place between my lips a\r\nvery slender glass tube and with delicate puffs send my breath into the\r\ndrop of moisture. To my great surprise, it does not froth up. The\r\nresult is just the same as that which I should have with plain water\r\nfrom the tap.\r\n\r\nInstead of a plentiful, lasting, slow-subsiding foam, like that with\r\nwhich the insect covers itself, all that I obtain is a miserable ring\r\nof bubbles, which burst as soon as they appear. And I am equally\r\nunsuccessful with the liquid which the Cicadella collects under her\r\nabdomen at the start, before working her bellows. What is wrong in each\r\ncase? The foamy product and its generating liquid shall tell us.\r\n\r\nThe first is oily to the touch, gummy and as fluid as, for instance, a\r\nweak solution of albumen would be; the second flows as readily as plain\r\nwater. The Cicadella therefore does not draw from her well a liquid\r\nliable to effervesce merely by the action of the blow-pocket; she adds\r\nsomething to what oozes from the puncture, adds a viscous element which\r\ngives cohesion and makes frothing possible, even as a boy adds soap to\r\nthe water which he blows into iridescent bubbles through a straw.\r\n\r\nWhere then does the insect keep its soap-works, its manufactory of the\r\neffervescent element? Evidently in the blow-pocket itself. It is here\r\nthat the intestine ends and here that albuminous products, furnished\r\neither by the digestive canal or by special glands, can be expelled in\r\ninfinitesimal doses. Each whiff sent out is thus accompanied by a\r\ntrifle of adhesive matter, which dissolves in the water, making it\r\nsticky and enabling it to retain the captive air in permanent bubbles.\r\nThe Cicadella covers herself with an icing of which her intestine is to\r\nsome extent the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nThis method brings us back to the industry of the lily-dweller, the\r\ngrub which makes itself a loathsome armour out of its excretions; [86]\r\nbut what a distance between the heap of ordure which it wears on its\r\nback and the Cicadella’s aerated mattress!\r\n\r\nAnother fact, more difficult to explain, attracts our attention. A\r\nmultitude of low-growing, herbaceous plants, whose sap starts flowing\r\nin April, suit the frothy insect, without distinction of species, genus\r\nor family. I could almost make a list of the non-ligneous vegetation of\r\nmy neighbourhood by cataloguing the plants on which the little\r\ncreature’s foam is to be found in greater or lesser abundance. A few\r\nexperiments will tell us how indifferent the Cicadella is to both the\r\nnature and the properties of the plant which she adopts as her home.\r\n\r\nI pick the insect out of its froth with the tip of a hair-pencil and\r\nplace it on some other plant, of an opposite flavour, letting the\r\nstrong come after the mild, the spicy after the insipid, the bitter\r\nafter the sweet. The new encampment is accepted without hesitation and\r\nsoon covered with foam. For instance, a Cicadella taken from the bean,\r\nwhich has a neutral flavour, thrives excellently on the spurges, full\r\nof pungent milky sap, and particularly on Euphorbia serrata, the narrow\r\nnotch-leaved spurge, which is one of her favourite dwelling-places. And\r\nshe is equally satisfied when moved from the highly-spiced spurge to\r\nthe comparatively flavourless bean.\r\n\r\nThis indifference is surprising when we reflect how scrupulously\r\nfaithful other insects are to their plants. There are undoubtedly\r\nstomachs expressly made to drink corrosive and assimilate toxic\r\nmatters. The caterpillar of Acherontia atropos, the Death’s-head\r\nHawk-moth, eats its fill of potato-leaves, which are seasoned with\r\nsolanin; the caterpillar of the Spurge-moth browses in these parts on\r\nthe upright red spurge (Euphorbia characias), whose milk produces much\r\nthe same effect as red-hot iron on the tongue; but neither one nor the\r\nother would pass from these narcotics or these caustics to utterly\r\ninsipid fare.\r\n\r\nHow does the Cicadella manage to feed on anything and everything, for\r\nshe evidently obtains nourishment while putting a head on her liquid? I\r\nsee her thrive, either of her own accord or by my devices, on the\r\ncommon buttercup (Ranunculus acris), which has a flavour unequalled\r\nsave by Cayenne pepper; on the Italian arum (Arum italicum), the\r\nveriest particle of whose leaves is enough to burn the lips; on the\r\ntraveller’s joy, or virgin’s bower (Clematis vitalba), the famous\r\nbeggars’ herb, which reddens the skin and produces the sores in request\r\namong our sham cripples. After these highly-seasoned condiments, she\r\nwill promptly accept the mild sainfoin, the scented savory, the bitter\r\ndandelion, the sweet field eringo, in short, anything that I put before\r\nher, whether full-flavoured or tasteless.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, this strange catholicity of diet might well be\r\nonly apparent. When the Cicadella punctures this or that herb, of\r\nwhatever species, all that she does is to extract an almost neutral\r\nliquid, just as the roots draw it from the soil; she does not admit to\r\nher fountain the fluids worked up into essential principles. The liquid\r\nthat trickles forth under the insect’s gimlet and forms a bead at the\r\nbottom of the foamy mass is perfectly clear.\r\n\r\nI have gathered this drop on the spurge, the arum, the clematis and the\r\nbuttercup. I expected to find a fire-water, pungent as the sap of those\r\ndifferent plants. Well, it is nothing of the kind; it lacks all savour;\r\nit is water or little more. And this insipid stuff has issued from a\r\nreservoir of vitriol.\r\n\r\nIf I prick the spurge with a fine needle, that which rises from the\r\npuncture is a white, milky drop, tasting horribly bitter. When the\r\nCicadella pushes in her drill, a clear, flavourless fluid oozes out.\r\nThe two operations seem to be directed towards different sources.\r\n\r\nHow does she manage to draw a liquid that is clear and harmless from\r\nthe same barrel whence my needle brings up something milky and burning?\r\nCan the Cicadella, with her instrument, that incomparable alembic,\r\ndivide the fierce fluid into two, admitting the neutral and rejecting\r\nthe peppery? Can she be drawing on certain vessels whose sap, not yet\r\nelaborated, has not acquired its final virulence? The delicate\r\nvegetable anatomy is helpless in the presence of the tiny creature’s\r\npump. I give up the problem.\r\n\r\nWhen the Cicadella is exploring the spurge, as frequently happens, she\r\nhas a serious reason for not admitting to her fountain all that would\r\nbe yielded by simple bleeding, such as my needle would produce. The\r\nmilky juice of the plant would be fatal to her.\r\n\r\nI gather a drop or two of the liquid that trickles from a cut stalk and\r\ninstal a Cicadella in it. The insect is not comfortable: I can see this\r\nby its efforts to escape. My hair-pencil pushes the fugitive back into\r\nthe pool of milk, rich in dissolved rubber. Soon this rubber settles\r\ninto clots similar to crumbs of cheese; the insect’s legs become clad\r\nin gaiters that seem made of casein; a coating of gum obstructs the\r\nbreathing-valves; possibly also the extremely delicate skin is hurt by\r\nthe blistering qualities of the milky sap. If kept for some time in\r\nthat environment, the Cicadella dies.\r\n\r\nEven so would she die if her gimlet, working simply as a needle,\r\nbrought the milk of the spurge to the surface. A sifting takes place\r\nthen, which allows almost pure water to issue from the source that\r\ngives the wherewithal for making the froth. A subtle\r\nexhaustion-process, whose mechanism is hidden from our curiosity, a\r\npiston-play of unrivalled delicacy, effects this marvellous work of\r\npurification.\r\n\r\nWater is always water, whether it come from the stagnant pool or the\r\nclear stream, from a poisonous liquid or a healing infusion; and it\r\npossesses the same properties, when it is rid of its impurities by\r\ndistillation. In like manner, the sap, whether furnished by the spurge\r\nor the bean, the clematis or the sainfoin, the buttercup or the borage,\r\nis of the same watery nature when the Cicadella’s syphon, by a\r\nreducing-process which would be the envy of our stills, has deprived it\r\nof its peculiar properties, which vary so greatly in different plants.\r\n\r\nThis would explain how the insect makes its froth rise on the first\r\nplant that it comes across. Everything suits it, because its apparatus\r\nreduces any sap to the condition of plain water. The inimitable\r\nwell-sinker is able to produce the limpid from the cloudy and the\r\nharmless from the toxic.\r\n\r\nIt may possibly happen that the insect’s well supplies water that is\r\nnot quite pure. If left to evaporate in a watch-glass, the clear drop\r\nthat trickles from the mass of foam yields a thin white residue, which\r\ndissolves by effervescence in nitric acid. This residue might well be\r\ncarbonate of potash. I also suspect the presence of traces of albumen.\r\n\r\nObviously, the Cicadella finds something to feed on at the bottom of\r\nthe puncture. Now what does she consume? To all appearances, something\r\nwith an albuminous basis, for the pigmy herself is, for the most part,\r\nbut a grain of similar matter. This element is plentiful in all plants;\r\nand it is probable that the insect uses it lavishly to make up for the\r\nexpenditure of gum needed for the formation of froth. Some albuminous\r\nproduct, perfected in the digestive canal and discharged by the\r\nintestine as and when the blow-pocket expels its bubble of air, might\r\nwell give the liquid the power of swelling into a foam that lasts for a\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\nIf we ask ourselves what advantage the Cicadella derives from her mass\r\nof froth, a very excellent answer is at once suggested: the insect\r\nkeeps itself cool under that shelter, hides itself from the eyes of its\r\npersecutors and is protected against the rays of the sun and the\r\nattacks of parasites.\r\n\r\nThe Lily-beetle makes a similar use of the mantle of her own dirt; but\r\nshe, most unhappily for herself, flings off her nasty cloak and\r\ndescends naked from the plant to the ground, where she has to bury\r\nherself to slaver her cocoon. At this critical moment, the Flies lie in\r\nwait for her and entrust her with their eggs, the germs of parasites\r\nwhich will eat into her body.\r\n\r\nThe Cicadella is better-advised and altogether escapes the dangers\r\nattendant on a removal. Subject to certain summary changes which never\r\ninterrupt her activity, she assumes the adult form in the very heart of\r\nher bastion, under the shelter of a viscous rampart capable of\r\nrepelling any assailant. Here she enjoys perfect security when the\r\ndifficult hour has come for tearing off her old skin and putting on\r\nanother, brand-new and more decorative; here she finds profound peace\r\nfor her excoriation and for the display of the attire of a riper age.\r\n\r\nThe insect does not leave its cool covering until it is grown up, when\r\nit appears in the form of a pretty little, brown-striped Cicadella. It\r\nis then able to take enormous and sudden leaps, which carry it far from\r\nthe aggressor; and it leads an easy life, untroubled by the foe.\r\n\r\nLooked upon as a system of defence, the frothy stronghold is indeed a\r\nmagnificent invention, much superior to the squalid work of the invader\r\nof the lily. And, strange to say, the system has no imitators among the\r\ngenera most nearly allied to the froth-blower.\r\n\r\nIn her larval form, the Asparagus-beetle is victimized by the Fly\r\nbecause she does not follow the example of her cousin, the Lily-beetle,\r\nand clothe herself in her own droppings. Even so, on the grass, on the\r\ntrees displaying their tender leaves, other Cicadellæ abound, no less\r\nexposed to danger from the Warbler seeking a succulent morsel for his\r\nlittle ones; and, as they draw out the sap through the punctures made\r\nby their suckers, not one of them thinks of making it effervesce. Yet\r\nthey too possess the elevator-pump, which they all work in the same\r\nmanner; only they do not know how to turn the end of their intestine\r\ninto a bellows. Why not? Because instincts are not to be acquired. They\r\nare primordial aptitudes, bestowed here and denied there; time cannot\r\nawaken them by a slow incubation, nor are they decreed by any\r\nsimilarity of organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]     You used to sing!

I have\r\nno other excuse.—Translator’s Note.\r\n\r\n[61] .117 to .156 inch.—Translator’s Note.\r\n\r\n[62] Fuller details on this curious subject would be out of place in a\r\nbook in which anatomy and physiology cannot always speak quite freely.\r\nThey will be found in my essay on the Locustidæ which appeared in the\r\nAnnales des sciences naturelles, 1896.—Author’s Note.\r\n\r\n[63]    “Fare thee well, good neighbour Cricket; from thy presence I\r\n                                                            must flee;\r\n        Mine ears also will be taken for a pair of horns,” said he.\r\n        “Horns, i’ faith!” the Cricket answered. “Is thy servant mad\r\n                                                             or blind?\r\n        Those are ears which thy Creator with His own hand hath\r\n                                                            designed!”\r\n        “Yet the world will one day call them horns,” his fellow made\r\n                                                                reply,\r\n        “And ere that day dawn, my neighbour, I will bid this place\r\n                                                            good-bye.”\r\n\r\n[64] Jean Pierre Claris de Florian (1755–1794), Voltaire’s\r\ngrand-nephew, the leading French fabulist, after La\r\nFontaine.—Translator’s Note.\r\n\r\n[65]   “My snug little home is a place of delight:\r\n        If you want to live happy, live hidden from sight!”\r\n\r\n[66] My friend, who is always accurate in his descriptions, is here\r\nspeaking, if I be not mistaken, of the Swallow-tail.—Author’s Note.\r\n\r\n[67] For the translation of these and the other verses in this chapter\r\nI am indebted to my friend Mr. Stephen McKenna.—Translator’s Note.\r\n\r\n[68] For the author’s only essay on Ants, cf.
