The term means\r\nsimply a _writing about drugs_; and it has been selected not without\r\ndue consideration, as in itself distinctive, easily quoted, and\r\nintelligible in many languages.\r\n\r\nPharmacographia, in its widest sense, embodies and expresses the joint\r\nintention of the authors. It was their desire, not only to write\r\nupon the general subject, and to utilize the thoughts of others; but\r\nthat the book which they decided to produce together should contain\r\nobservations that no one else had written down. It is in fact a\r\nrecord of personal researches on the principal drugs derived from the\r\nvegetable kingdom, together with such results of an important character\r\nas have been obtained by the numerous workers on Materia Medica in\r\nEurope, India, and America.\r\n\r\nUnlike most of their predecessors in Great Britain during this century,\r\nthe authors have not included in their programme either Pharmacy or\r\nTherapeutics; nor have they attempted to give their work that diversity\r\nof scope which would render it independent of collateral publications\r\non Botany and Chemistry.\r\n\r\nWhile thus restricting the field of their inquiry, the authors have\r\nendeavoured to discuss with fuller detail many points of interest which\r\nare embraced in the special studies of the pharmacist; and at the\r\nsame time have occasionally indicated the direction in which further\r\ninvestigations are desirable. A few remarks on the heads under which\r\neach particular article is treated, will explain more precisely their\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nThe drugs included in the present work are chiefly those which are\r\ncommonly kept in store by pharmacists, or are known in the drug and\r\nspice market of London. The work likewise contains a small number which\r\nbelong to the _Pharmacopœia of India_: the appearance of this volume\r\nseemed to present a favourable opportunity for giving some more copious\r\nnotice of the latter than has hitherto been attempted.\r\n\r\nSupplementary to these two groups must be placed a few substances which\r\npossess little more than historical interest, and have been introduced\r\nrather in obedience to custom, and for the sake of completeness, than\r\non account of their intrinsic value.\r\n\r\nEach drug is headed by the Latin name, followed by such few synonyms as\r\nmay suffice for perfect identification, together in most cases with the\r\nEnglish, French, and German designation.\r\n\r\nIn the next section, the _Botanical Origin_ of the substance is\r\ndiscussed, and the area of its growth, or locality of its production is\r\nstated. Except in a few instances, no attempt has been made to furnish\r\nbotanical descriptions of the plants to which reference is made. Such\r\ninformation may readily be obtained from original and special sources,\r\nof which we have quoted some of the most important.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of _History_, the authors have endeavoured to trace the\r\nintroduction of each substance into medicine, and to bring forward\r\nother points in connection therewith, which have not hitherto been\r\nmuch noticed in any recent work. This has involved researches which\r\nhave been carried on for several years, and has necessitated the\r\nconsultation of many works of general literature. The exact titles\r\nof these works have been scrupulously preserved, in order to enable\r\nthe reader to verify the statements made, and to prosecute further\r\nhistorical inquiries. In this portion of their task, the authors have\r\nto acknowledge the assistance kindly given them by Professors Heyd[1]\r\nof Stuttgart, Winkelmann of Heidelberg, Monier Williams of Oxford,\r\nDümichen of Strassburg; and on subjects connected with China, by Mr. A.\r\nWylie and Dr. Bretschneider. The co-operation in various directions of\r\nmany other friends has been acknowledged in the text itself.\r\n\r\n[1] The admirable work of this author—_Geschichte des Levantehandels im\r\nMittelalter_, 2 vols., Stuttgart, 1879—appeared when the second edition\r\nof our Pharmacographia was already in the press.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the _Formation_, _Secretion_, or _Method of\r\nCollection_ of a drug, has been next detailed: in others, the section\r\n_History_ has been immediately followed by the _Description_, succeeded\r\nby one in which the more salient features of _Microscopic Structure_\r\nhave been set forth. The authors have not thought it desirable to\r\namplify the last named section, as the subject deserves to be treated\r\nin a special work, and to be illustrated by engravings. Written\r\ndescriptions of microscopic structure are tedious and uninteresting,\r\nand however carefully drawn up, must often fail to convey the true\r\nmeaning which would be easily made evident by the pencil. The reader\r\nwho wishes for illustrations of the minute structure of drugs may\r\nconsult the works named in the footnote.[2]\r\n\r\nThe next division includes the important subject of _Chemical\r\nComposition_, in which the authors have striven to point out to the\r\nreader familiar with chemistry what are the constituents of greatest\r\ninterest in each particular drug—what the characters of the less\r\ncommon of those constituents—and by whom and at what date the chief\r\ninvestigations have been made. A knowledge of the name and date\r\nprovides a clue to the original memoir, which may usually be found,\r\neither _in extenso_ or in abstract, in more than one periodical.\r\nIt has been no part of the authors’ plan to supersede reference to\r\nstandard works on chemistry, or to describe the chemical character of\r\nsubstances[3] which may be easily ascertained from those sources of\r\ninformation which should be within the reach of every pharmaceutical\r\ninquirer.\r\n\r\nIn the section devoted to _Production and Commerce_, the authors\r\nhave given such statistics and other trade information as they could\r\nobtain from reliable sources; but they regret that this section is\r\nof very unequal value. Duties have been abolished, and a general and\r\ncontinuous simplification of tariffs and trade regulations has ensued.\r\nThe details, therefore, that used to be observed regarding the commerce\r\nin drugs, exists no longer in anything like their former state of\r\ncompleteness: hence the fragmentary nature of much of the information\r\nrecorded under this head.\r\n\r\nThe medicinal uses of each particular drug are only slightly mentioned,\r\nit being felt that the science of therapeutics lies within the province\r\nof the physician, and may be wisely relinquished to his care. At the\r\nsame time it may be remarked that the authors would have rejoiced had\r\nthey been able to give more definite information as to the technical or\r\neconomic uses of some of the substances they have described.\r\n\r\n[2] Berg, _Anatomischer Atlas zur pharmazeutischen Waarenkunde_,\r\nBerlin, 1865. 4to., with 50 plates.\r\n\r\nFlückiger, _Grundlagen der pharmaceutischen Waarenkunde, Einleitung in\r\ndas Studium der Pharmacognosie_, Berlin, 1873.\r\n\r\nPlanchon, _Traité pratique de la détermination des drogues simples\r\nd’origine végétale_, Paris, 1874.\r\n\r\nLuerssen, _Medicinisch-Pharmaceutische Botanik_, Leipzig (in progress).\r\n\r\n[3] For further information, see Flückiger, _Pharmaceutische Chemie_,\r\nBerlin, 1879.\r\n\r\nWhat has been written under the head of _Adulteration_ is chiefly\r\nthe result of actual observation, or might otherwise have been much\r\nextended. The authors would rather rely on the characters laid down in\r\npreceding sections than upon empirical methods for the determination\r\nof purity. The heading of _Substitutes_ has been adopted for certain\r\ndrugs, more or less related to those described in special articles, yet\r\nnot actually used by way of adulteration.\r\n\r\nA work professing to bring together the latest researches in any\r\nsubject will naturally be thought to contain needless innovations.\r\nWhilst deprecating the inconvenience of changes of nomenclature, the\r\nauthors have had no alternative but to adopt the views sanctioned by\r\nthe leaders of chemical and botanical science, and which the progress\r\nof knowledge has required. The common designations of drugs may indeed\r\nremain unchanged:—hellebore, aconite, colchicum, anise, and caraway,\r\nneed no modernizing touch. But when we attempt to combine with these\r\nsimple names, words to indicate the organ of the plant of which they\r\nare constituted, questions arise as to the strict application of such\r\nterms as root, rhizome, tuber, corm, about which a diversity of opinion\r\nmay be entertained.\r\n\r\nIt has been the authors’ aim to investigate anew the field of Vegetable\r\nMateria Medica, in order as far as possible to clear up doubtful\r\npoints, and to remove some at least of the uncertainties by which the\r\nsubject is surrounded. In furtherance of this plan they have availed\r\nthemselves of the resources offered by Ancient and Modern History; nor\r\nhave they hesitated to lay under contribution either the teaching of\r\nmen eminent in science, or the labours of those who follow the paths of\r\ngeneral literature. How far they have accomplished their desire remains\r\nfor the public to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRIGENDA.\r\n\r\n    Page  57, footnote 4; _for_ qui produit,\r\n                          _read_ qui a produit.\r\n      ”   86, 13th line from bottom; _for_ Bauchin,\r\n                                     _read_ Bauhin.\r\n      ”  128, footnote 3; _read_ Adversariorum,\r\n                          _for_ Adersariorum.\r\n      ”  161, line from top; _read_ southern and south-western\r\n                       part, _for_ northern part.\r\n      ”  265, footnote 2; _for_ 4794 grammes,\r\n                          _read_ 4·794 grammes.\r\n      ”  271, line 5 from bottom; _read_ στνραξ νγρὸϛ\r\n                                  _for_ πνρα ζνγρὸϛ.\r\n      ”  368, line 12 from bottom; _read_ Flora, _for_ Floræ.\r\n      ”   ”     ”  20          ”      ”   mossing, _for_ motsing.\r\n      ”  369,   ”  17 from top; _read_ José, _for_ Jose.\r\n      ”  404,   ”   2 from bottom; _read_ Xarnauz,\r\n                                   _for_ Xarnaux.\r\n      ”   ”   footnote 7; _read_ por, _for_ par.\r\n      ”   ”   line 12 from bottom; _read_ Barbarigo,\r\n                                   _for_ Barberigo.\r\n      ”  407,   ”   5         ”       ”   benzoic, _for_ benzoin.\r\n      ”  469, lines 21 and 24 from top; with reference to _Nicotiana\r\n              rustica_ and _N. repanda_,\r\n              see _Pharm.

To Dr. Charles Rice of New York, editor of\r\n“New Remedies,” I am indebted for much kindly extended and valuable\r\ninformation, and to whose intimate acquaintance with oriental\r\nliterature, both ancient and modern, many of the following pages bear\r\nample testimony. I am likewise indebted for similar assistance to my\r\nfriends Professors Goldschmidt and Nöldeke, Strassburg. Information of\r\nvarious kinds, as well as valuable specimens of drugs, have also been\r\ncourteously supplied to me by the following gentlemen, viz.:—Cesar\r\nChantre, Esq., F.L.S., London; Prof. Dymock, Bombay; H. Fritzsche, Esq.\r\n(Schimmel &, Leipzig); E. M. Holmes, Esq., F.L.S., &c., London; J. E.\r\nHoward, Esq., F.R.S., &c., London; David Howard, Esq., F.C.S., &c.;\r\nWm. Dillworth Howard, F.I.C., London; Capt. F. M. Hunter, F.G.S., &c.,\r\nAssistant Resident, Aden; A. Oberdörffer, Esq., Hamburg; Prof. Edward\r\nSchär, Zürich; Dr. J. E. de Vry, the Hague, &c.\r\n\r\nOn mature consideration, it was deemed expedient to omit in the new\r\nedition a large number of references relating more especially to\r\nchemical facts. Yet, in most instances, not only the author but\r\nalso the year has been stated in which the respective observation or\r\ndiscovery was made, or at least the year in which it was published\r\nor recorded. Every such fact of any importance may thus, by means of\r\nthose short references, be readily traced and consulted, if wished\r\nfor, either in the original sources, in abstracts therefrom, or in the\r\nperiodical reports. Opportunities of the latter kind are abundantly\r\nafforded by the German _Jahresbericht der Pharmacie_, &c., published at\r\nGöttingen since 1844, successively by Martius, Wiggers, Husemann, and\r\nat the present time by Dragendorff. The same may be said, since 1857,\r\nof the _Report on the Progress of Pharmacy_, as contained annually\r\nin the Proceedings of the American Pharmaceutical Association, and\r\nlikewise, since 1870, of the _Yearbook of Pharmacy_, for which the\r\nprofession is indebted to the British Pharmaceutical Conference.\r\n\r\n                                                   PROF. FLÜCKIGER.\r\n    STRASSBURG, GERMANY, _October, 1879_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Polarization.=—Most essential oils, and the solutions of several\r\nsubstances described in this book are capable of effecting the\r\ndeviation of a ray of polarized light. The amount of this rotatory\r\npower cannot be regarded as constant in essential oils, and is\r\ngreatly influenced by various causes. As to alkaloids and other\r\norganic compounds, the deviation frequently depends upon the nature\r\nand quantity of the solvent. The authors have thought it needful to\r\nrecord in numerous cases the results of such optical investigations,\r\nas determined by means of the _Polaristrobometer_ invented by Wild,\r\nand described in Poggendorff’s _Annalen der Physik und Chemie_, vol.\r\n122 (1864) p. 626; or more completely in the _Bulletin de l’Académie\r\nimpériale des Sciences de St. Pétersbourg_, tome viii. (1869) p. 33.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n=Measurements and Weights.=—The authors regret to have been unable to\r\nadopt one standard system of stating measurements. They have mostly\r\nemployed the English inch: the accompanying woodcut will facilitate\r\nits comparison with the French decimal scale. The word _millimetre_\r\nis indicated in the text by the contraction _mm._; _micromillimetre_,\r\nsignifying the thousandth part of a millimetre, and only used in\r\nreference to the microscope, is abbreviated thus, _mkm._\r\n\r\n    1 inch              =   25·399 millimetres.\r\n    1 gallon            =    4·543 litres.\r\n    1 ounce (oz.) avdp. =   28·34 grammes.\r\n    1 lb. avoirdupois   =  453·59    ”\r\n    1 cwt.              =  112 lb. = 50·8 kilogrammes.\r\n    1 ton               = 2240  ”  = 1016     ”\r\n    1 kilogramme        =    2·204 lb. avoirdupois.\r\n    1 pecul             =  133·33 lb.   =   60·479 kilogrammes.\r\n\r\n=Thermometer.=—The _Centigrade Thermometer_ has been alone adopted. The\r\nfollowing table is given _for comparing the degrees of the Centigrade\r\nor Celsius Thermometer with those of Fahrenheit’s Scale_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERMOMETRIC TABLE.\r\n\r\n    --------------+----------------+-----------------+---------------\r\n    CENT.

        G. _Schwarze Nieswurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Helleborus niger_ L., a low perennial herb, native\r\nof sub-alpine woods in Southern and Eastern Europe. It is found in\r\nProvence, Northern Italy, Salzburg, Bavaria, Austria, Bohemia, and\r\nSilesia, as well as, according to Boissier,[4] in Continental Greece.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of _Christmas Rose_, it is often grown in English\r\ngardens on account of its handsome white flowers, which are put forth\r\nin midwinter.\r\n\r\n=History=—The story of the daughters of Prœtus, king of Argos, being\r\ncured of madness by the soothsayer and physician Melampus, who\r\nadministered to them hellebore, has imparted great celebrity to the\r\nplant under notice.[5]\r\n\r\nBut admitting that the medicine of Melampus was really the root of a\r\nspecies of _Helleborus_, its identity with that of the present plant\r\nis extremely improbable. Several other species grow in Greece and\r\nAsia Minor, and Schroff[6] has endeavoured to show that of these,\r\n_H. orientalis_ Lam. possesses medicinal powers agreeing better with\r\nthe ancient accounts than those of _H. niger_ L. He has also pointed\r\nout that the ancients employed not the entire root but only the bark\r\nseparated from the woody column; and that in _H. niger_ and _H.\r\nviridis_ the peeling of the rhizome is impossible, but that in _H.\r\norientalis_ it may be easily effected.\r\n\r\n[4] _Flora Orientalis_, i. (1867) 61.\r\n\r\n[5] See the list of theses and memoirs on Hellebore given by Mérat and\r\nDe Lens, _Dict._ iii. (1831) 472, 473.\r\n\r\n[6] _Zeitschr. d. Gesellsch. d. Aerzte zu Wien._ 1860, No. 25;\r\nCanstatt’s _Jahresbericht_ for 1859. i. 47. 1860. i. 55.\r\n\r\nAccording to the same authority the hellebores differ extremely in\r\ntheir medicinal activity. The most potent is _H. orientalis_ Lam.;\r\nthen follow _H. viridis_ L. and _H. fœtidus_ L. (natives of Britain),\r\nand _H. purpurascens_ Waldst. et Kit., a Hungarian species, while _H.\r\nniger_ is the weakest of all.[7]\r\n\r\n=Description=—Black Hellebore produces a knotty, fleshy, brittle\r\nrhizome which creeps and branches slowly, forming in the course of\r\nyears an intangled, interlacing mass, throwing out an abundance of\r\nstout, straight roots. Both rhizome and roots are of a blackish brown,\r\nbut the younger roots are of lighter tint and are covered with a short\r\nwoolly tomentum.\r\n\r\nIn commerce the rhizome is found with the roots more or less broken\r\noff and detached. It is in very knotty irregular pieces, 1 to 2 or 3\r\ninches long and about ²/₁₀ to ³/₁₀ of an inch in diameter, internally\r\nwhitish and of a horny texture. If cut transversely (especially after\r\nmaceration), it shows a circle of white woody wedges, 8 to 12 in\r\nnumber, surrounded by a thick bark. The roots are unbranched, scarcely\r\n⅒ of an inch in diameter. The younger, when broken across, exhibit a\r\nthick bark encircling a simple woody cord; in the older this cord tends\r\nto divide into converging wedges which present a stellate appearance,\r\nthough not so distinctly as in _Actæa_. The drug when cut or broken has\r\na slight odour like that of senega. Its taste is bitterish and slightly\r\nacrid.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The cortical part both of the rhizome and the\r\nrootlets exhibits no distinct medullary rays. In the rootlets the woody\r\ncentre is comparatively small and enclosed by a narrow zone somewhat as\r\nin sarsaparilla. A distinct pith occurs in the rhizome but not always\r\nin the rootlets, their woody column forming one solid bundle or being\r\ndivided into several. The tissue contains small starch granules and\r\ndrops of fatty oil.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The earlier investigations of Black Hellebore\r\nby Gmelin, and Feneuille and Capron, and of Riegel indicated only the\r\npresence of the more usual constituents of plants.\r\n\r\nBastick, on the other hand, in 1852 obtained from the root a peculiar,\r\nnon-volatile, crystalline, chemically-indifferent substance which he\r\nnamed _Helleborin_. It is stated to have a bitter taste and to produce\r\nin addition a tingling sensation on the tongue; to be slightly soluble\r\nin water, more so in ether, and to dissolve freely in alcohol.\r\n\r\nMarmé and A. Husemann extracted helleborin (1864) by treating with hot\r\nwater the green fatty matter which is dissolved out of the root by\r\nboiling alcohol. After recrystallization from alcohol, it is obtainable\r\nin shining, colourless needles, having the composition C₃₆H₄₂O₆. It is\r\nstated to be highly narcotic. Helleborin appears to be more abundant\r\nin _H. viridis_ (especially in the older roots) than in _H. niger_,\r\nand yet to be obtainable only to the extent of 0·4 per mille. When it\r\nis boiled with dilute sulphuric acid, or still better with solution of\r\nzinc chloride, it is converted into sugar and _Helleboresin_, C₃₀H₃₈O₄.\r\n\r\n[7] Between _purpurascens_ and _niger_, Schroff places _L. ponticus_ A.\r\nBr., a plant which Boissier holds to be simply _H. orientalis_ Lam.\r\n\r\nMarmé and Husemann succeeded in isolating other crystallized\r\nprinciples from the leaves and roots of _H. niger_ and _H. viridis_,\r\nby precipitation with phospho-molybdic acid. They obtained firstly a\r\nslightly acid glucoside which they named _Helleboreïn_. It occurs only\r\nin very small proportion, but is rather more abundant in _H. niger_\r\nthan in _H. viridis_. When boiled with a dilute acid, helleboreïn,\r\nC₂₆H₄₄O₁₅, is resolved into _Helleboretin_, C₁₄H₂₀O₃, of a fine violet\r\ncolour, and sugar, C₁₂H₂₄O₁₂. It is remarkable that helleboretin has no\r\nphysiological action, though helleboreïn is stated to be poisonous.\r\n\r\nAn organic acid accompanying helleborin was regarded by Bastick as\r\nprobably aconitic (equisetic) acid. There is no tannin in hellebore.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Black Hellebore is reputed to be a drastic purgative. In British\r\nmedicine its employment is nearly obsolete, but the drug is still\r\nimported from Germany and sold for the use of domestic animals.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Black Hellebore root as found in the market is not\r\nalways to be relied on, and without good engravings it is not easy to\r\npoint out characters by which its genuineness can be made certain. In\r\nfact to ensure its recognition, some pharmacopœias required that it\r\nshould be supplied with leaves attached.\r\n\r\nThe roots with which it is chiefly liable to be confounded are the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n1. _Helleborus viridis_ L.—Although a careful comparison of\r\nauthenticated specimens reveals certain small differences between the\r\nroots and rhizomes of this species and of _H. niger_, there are no\r\nstriking characters by which they can be discriminated. The root of\r\n_H. viridis_ is far more bitter and acrid than that of _H. niger_, and\r\nit exhibits more numerous drops of fatty oil. In German trade the two\r\ndrugs are supplied separately, both being in use; but as _H. viridis_\r\nis apparently the rarer plant and its root is valued at 3 to 5 times\r\nthe price of that of _H. niger_, it is not likely to be used for\r\nsophisticating the latter.\r\n\r\n2. _Actœa spicata_ L.—In this plant the rhizome is much thicker; the\r\nrootlets broken transversely display a cross or star, as figured in\r\nFlückiger’s “Grundlagen” (see p. vii.), fig. 64, p. 76. The drug has\r\nbut little odour; as it contains tannin its infusion is blackened by\r\na persalt of iron, which is not the case with an infusion of Black\r\nHellebore.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHIZOMA COPTIDIS.\r\n\r\n_Radix Coptidis_; _Coptis Root_, _Mishmi Bitter_, _Mishmi Tita_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Coptis Teeta_ Wallich, a small herbaceous plant,\r\nstill but imperfectly known, indigenous to the Mishmi mountains,\r\neastward of Assam. It was first described in 1836 by Wallich.[8]\r\n\r\n=History=—This drug under the name of _Mahmira_ is used in Sind for\r\ninflammation of the eyes, a circumstance which enabled Pereira[9] to\r\nidentify it with a substance bearing a nearly similar designation,\r\nmentioned by the early writers on medicine, and previously regarded as\r\nthe root of _Chelidonium majus_ L.\r\n\r\n[8] _Trans. of Med. and Phys. Soc. of Calcutta_, viii. (1836) 85.\r\nReprinted in _Pereira’s_ Materia Medica, vol ii. part 2 (1857), 699.\r\n\r\n[9] _Pharm. Journ._ xi. (1852) 204; also _Mat. Med. l.c._\r\n\r\nThus we find that Paulus Ægineta in the 7th century was acquainted\r\nwith a knotty root named Μαηιρά.[10] Rhazes, who according to Choulant\r\ndied in A.D. 923 or 932, mentions _Mamiran_, and it is also noticed\r\nby Avicenna a little later as a drug useful in diseases of the eye.\r\nΜαμιρὰϛ likewise occurs in exactly the same way in the writings of\r\n_Leo_, “Philosophus et Medicus.”[11] Ibn Baytar called the drug\r\n_Mamiran_ and _Uruk_, and described it as a small yellow root like\r\nturmeric, coming from China. Other writers of the middle ages allude to\r\nit under the name of _Memeren_.\r\n\r\nHajji Mahomed, in the account of Cathay which he gave to Ramusio\r\n(_circa_ A.D. 1550) says that the _Mambroni chini_, by which we\r\nunderstand the root in question, is found in the mountains of Succuir\r\n(Suh-cheu) where rhubarb grows, and that it is a wonderful remedy for\r\ndiseases of the eye.[12] In an official report published at Lahore in\r\n1862,[13] _Mamiran-i-chini_ is said to be brought from China to Yarkand.\r\n\r\nThe rhizome of _Coptis_ is used by the Chinese under the names\r\n_Hwang-lien_ and _Chuen-lien_.[14] It is enumerated by Cleyer[15]\r\n(1682) as “_radix pretiosa amara_,” and was described in 1778 by\r\nBergius[16] who received it from Canton.\r\n\r\nMore recently it was the subject of an interesting notice by\r\nGuibourt[17] who thought it to be derived from _Ophioxylon serpentinum_\r\nL., an apocyneous plant widely removed from _Coptis_. Its root was\r\nrecommended in India by MacIsaac[18] in 1827 and has been subsequently\r\nemployed with success by many practitioners.\r\n\r\nThere is a rude figure of the plant in the Chinese herbal _Pun-tsao_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—_Tita_, as the drug is called in the Mishmi country,\r\nwhence it is sent by way of Sudiya on the Bramaputra to Bengal, is a\r\nrhizome about the thickness of a quill occurring in pieces an inch or\r\ntwo in length. It often branches at the crown into two or three heads,\r\nand bears the remains of leafstalks and thin wiry rootlets, the stumps\r\nof which latter give it a rough and spiny appearance. It is nearly\r\ncylindrical, often contorted, and of a yellowish-brown colour. The\r\nfracture is short, exhibiting a loose structure, with large bright\r\nyellow radiating woody bundles. The rhizome is intensely bitter,[19]\r\nbut not aromatic even when fresh.\r\n\r\nIt is found in the Indian bazaars in neat little open-work bags formed\r\nof narrow strips of rattan, each containing about half an ounce. We\r\nhave once seen it in bulk in the London market.[20]\r\n\r\n[10] See also Meyer, _Geschichte der Botanik_, ii. (1855) 419.\r\n\r\n[11] _F. Z.

The latter are most obvious on account of their bright\r\nyellow colour. In the woody central column a somewhat concentric\r\narrangement is found, corresponding to two or three periods of annual\r\ngrowth. The pith, not the medullary rays, begins to be obliterated\r\nat an early period. The structure of the drug is, on the whole, very\r\nirregular, on account of the branches and numerous rootlets arising\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nThe medullary rays contain small starch granules, while the bark, as\r\nwell as the pith, are richer in albuminous or mucilaginous matters.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The colouring matter in which the rhizome of\r\n_Coptis_ abounds, is quickly dissolved by water. If the yellow solution\r\nobtained by macerating it in water is duly concentrated, nitric acid\r\nwill produce an abundant heavy precipitate of minute yellow crystals,\r\nwhich if redissolved in a little boiling water will separate again in\r\nstellate groups. Solution of iodine also precipitates a cold infusion\r\nof the root.\r\n\r\nThese reactions as well as the bitterness of the drug are due to a\r\nlarge proportion of _Berberine_, as proved by J. D. Perrins.[21] The\r\nrhizome yielded not less than 8½ per cent., which is more than has been\r\nmet with in any other of the numerous plants containing that alkaloid.\r\n\r\nAs pure berberine is scarcely dissolved by water, it must be combined\r\nin _Coptis_ with an acid forming a soluble salt. Further researches\r\nare requisite to determine the nature of this acid. In some plants\r\nberberine is accompanied by a second basic principle: whether in the\r\npresent instance such is the case, has not been ascertained.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The drug has been introduced into the _Pharmacopœia of India_ as\r\na pure, bitter tonic.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—_Thalictrum foliolosum_ DC., a tall plant common at\r\nMussooree and throughout the temperate Himalaya at 5000-8000 feet, as\r\nwell as on the Khasia Hills, affords a yellow root which is exported\r\nfrom Kumaon under the name _Momiri_. From the description in the\r\n_Pharmacopœia of India_, it would appear to much resemble the _Mishmi\r\nTita_, and it is not impossible that some of the observations made\r\nunder the head _History_ (p. 3) may apply to _Thalictrum_ as well as to\r\n_Coptis_.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the rhizome of _Coptis trifolia_ Salisb., a small\r\nherb indigenous to the United States and Arctic America, and also found\r\nin European and Asiatic Russia, is employed for the same purposes\r\nas the Indian drug. It contains berberine and another crystalline\r\nprinciple.[22]\r\n\r\n[21] _Journ. of Chem. Soc._ xv. (1862) 339.\r\n\r\n[22] Gross in _Am.

It is\r\ncultivated to some extent in Puglia, very little now near Montpellier.\r\n\r\n=History=—Stavesacre was well known to the ancients. It is the ἀγροτἔρη\r\nσταϕὶς of Nicander,[23] the σταϕὶς ἀγρία of Dioscorides,[24] and\r\nAlexander Trallianus,[25] the _Staphisagria_ or _Herba pedicularia_ of\r\nScribonius Largus,[26] the _Astaphis agria_ or _Staphis_ of Pliny.[27]\r\nThe last named author mentions the use of the powdered seeds for\r\ndestroying vermin on the head and other parts of the body.\r\n\r\nThe drug continued in use during the middle ages. Pietro\r\nCrescenzio,[28] who lived in the 13th century, mentions the collection\r\nof the seeds in Italy; and Simon Januensis,[29] physician to Pope\r\nNicolas IV. (A.D. 1288-1292), describes them—“_propter excellentem\r\noperationem in caputpurgio_.”\r\n\r\n[23] O. Schneider, _Nicandrea_, Lips. 1856. 271.\r\n\r\n[24] _De Mat.

(1511) lib. vi. c. 108.\r\n\r\n[29] _Clavis Sanationis_, Venet. 1510.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit consists of three downy follicles, in each of\r\nwhich about 12 seeds are closely packed in two rows. The seeds (which\r\nalone are found in commerce) are about 3 lines in length and rather\r\nless in width; they have the form of a very irregular 4-sided pyramid,\r\nof which one side, much broader than the others, is distinctly vaulted.\r\nThey are sharp-angled, a little flattened, and very rough, the testa\r\nbeing both wrinkled and deeply pitted. The latter is blackish-brown,\r\ndull and earthy-looking, rather brittle, yet not hard. It encloses a\r\nsoft, whitish, oily albumen with a minute embryo at its sharper end.\r\n\r\nThe seeds have a bitter taste and occasion a tingling sensation when\r\nchewed. Ten of them weigh about 6 grains.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The epidermis of the seed consists of one layer\r\nof large cells, either nearly cubical or longitudinally extended:\r\nhence the wrinkles of the surface. The brown walls of these cells are\r\nmoderately thickened by secondary deposits, which may be made very\r\nobvious by macerating thin sections in a solution of chromic acid, 1 p.\r\nin 100 p. of water. By this treatment numerous crystals after a short\r\ntime make their appearance,—without doubt the chromate of one of the\r\nalkaloids of staphisagria.\r\n\r\nThe outer layer of the testa is made up of thin-walled narrow cells,\r\nwhich become larger near the edges of the seed and in the superficial\r\nwrinkles. They contain a small number of minute starch granules and are\r\nnot altered on addition of a salt of iron. The interior layer exhibits\r\na single row of small, densely packed cells. The albumen is composed of\r\nthe usual tissue loaded with granules of albuminoid matter and drops of\r\nfatty oil.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Brandes (1819) and Lassaigne and Feneulle (1819)\r\nhave shown this drug to contain a basic principle. Erdmann in 1864\r\nassigned it the formula C₂₄H₃₅NO₂; he obtained it to the extent of\r\n1 per mille in crystals, soluble in ether, alcohol, chloroform, or\r\nbenzol. The alkaloid has an extremely burning and acrid taste, and is\r\nhighly poisonous.\r\n\r\nCouerbe[30] in 1833 pointed out the presence in stavesacre of a second\r\nalkaloid separable from delphinine by ether in which it is insoluble.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the shell of the seed with chromic acid, detailed\r\nabove, shows that this part of the drug is the principal seat of\r\nthe alkaloids; and the albumen indeed furnishes no crystals of any\r\nchromate. In confirmation of this view we exhausted about 400 grammes\r\nof the _entire seeds_ with warm spirit of wine acidulated with a little\r\nacetic acid. The liquid was allowed to evaporate and the residue\r\nmixed with warm water. The solution thus obtained, separated from the\r\nresin, yielded on addition of chromic acid an abundant precipitate of\r\nchromate. The same solution likewise furnished copious precipitates\r\nwhen bichloride of platinum,[31] iodohydrargyrate of potassium, or\r\nbichromate of potassium were added. By repeating the above treatment on\r\na larger scale we obtained crystals of delphinine of considerable size,\r\nand also a second alkaloid not soluble in ether.\r\n\r\n[30] _Ann. de Chimie et de Phys._ lii. (1833) 352.\r\n\r\n[31] The platinic compound is in fine microscopic crystals.\r\n\r\nIn the laboratory of Dragendorff, Marquis in 1877 succeeded in\r\nisolating the following alkaloids:—1. _Delphinine_, C₂₂H₃₅NO₆, yielding\r\ncrystals one inch in length, belonging to the rhombic System. They\r\nare soluble in 11 parts of ether, 15 parts of chloroform, and 20\r\nof absolute alcohol. 2. _Staphisagrine_, C₂₂H₃₃NO₅, is amorphous,\r\nsoluble in less than 1 part of ether, also in 200 parts of water at\r\n150°. This alkaloid, although it would appear to be the anhydride of\r\nthe former, is in every respect widely different from delphinine. 3.\r\n_Delphinoidine_ (formula not quite settled), amorphous, soluble in\r\nthree parts of ether, more abundantly occurring in the seed than the\r\ntwo former alkaloids. In its physiological action delphinoidine agrees\r\nwith delphinine, not with staphisagrine. 4. _Delphisine_ (formula\r\ndoubtful) forms crystalline tufts, occurs in but small amount, is\r\nsparingly soluble in alcohol, chloroform, or ether.—The total amount of\r\nalkaloids afforded by stavesacre is about 1 per cent.\r\n\r\nBy exhausting the seeds with boiling ether, we get 27 per cent. of a\r\ngreenish, fatty oil, which continued fluid even at -5° C. It concreted\r\nby means of hyponitric acid, and is therefore to be reckoned among the\r\nnon-drying oils; it contained a large part of the alkaloids.\r\n\r\nThe drug air-dry contains 8 per cent. of hygroscopic water. Dried at\r\n100° C. and incinerated it left 8·7 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\nNothing exact is known of the _Delphinic acid_ of Hofschläger (about\r\n1820) said to be crystalline and volatile.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The seeds are imported from Trieste and from the south of\r\nFrance, especially from Nismes, near which city as well as in Italy\r\n(Puglia) the plant is cultivated.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Stavesacre seeds are still employed as in old times for the\r\ndestruction of _pediculi_ in the human subject, for which purpose they\r\nare reduced to powder which is dusted among the hair. Dr. Balmanno\r\nSquire[32] having ascertained that _prurigo senilis_ is dependent on\r\nthe presence of _pediculus_, has recommended an ointment of which\r\ntheessential ingredients is the fatty oil of stavesacre seeds extracted\r\nby ether. It is plain that such a preparation would contain delphinine.\r\nDelphinine itself has been used externally in neuralgic affections.\r\nStavesacre seeds are largely consumed for destroying the pediculi that\r\ninfest cattle.\r\n\r\n[32] _Pharm.

It has become\r\nnaturalized in a few spots in the west of England and in South Wales.\r\nEastward it grows throughout the whole of Siberia, extending to the\r\nmountain ranges of the Pacific coast of North America. It occurs in\r\ncompany with other species on the Himalaya at 10,000 to 16,000 feet\r\nabove the sea-level.\r\n\r\nThe plant is cultivated for medicinal use, and also for ornament.\r\nThe Abbé Armand David[34] saw in northern Sz-chuen (Setchuan) fields\r\nplanted with Aconite (A. Napellus?).\r\n\r\n=History=—The Ἀκόνιτον of the Greeks and the _Aconitum_ of the Romans\r\nare held to refer to the genus under notice, if not precisely to _A.\r\nNapellus_. The ancients were well aware of the poisonous properties of\r\nthe aconites, though the plants were not more exactly distinguished\r\nuntil the close of the middle ages. The Greek name is supposed to refer\r\nto the same source as that of Conium. (See article on Fructus Conii.)\r\n\r\nAconite has been widely employed as an arrow-poison. It was used by\r\nthe ancient Chinese,[35] and is still in requisition among the less\r\ncivilized of the hill tribes of India. Something of the same kind was\r\nin vogue among the aborigines of ancient Gaul.[36] Aconite was pointed\r\nout in the thirteenth century, in “_The Physicians of Myddvai_,”[37] as\r\none of the plants which every physician is to grow.\r\n\r\nStörck of Vienna introduced aconite into regular practice about the\r\nyear 1762[38]; the root and the herb occur in the German pharmaceutical\r\ntariff of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n[33] We use the word _root_ as most in accordance with the teaching of\r\nEnglish botanists.\r\n\r\n[34] _Journal de mon troisième voyage en Chine_, i.

Llandovery, 1861. 282, 457.\r\n\r\n[38] _De Stramonio, Hyoscyamo et Aconito_, Vindob. 1762.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The herbaceous annual stem of aconite starts from an\r\nelongated conical tuberous root 2 to 4 inches long and sometimes as\r\nmuch as an inch in thickness. This root tapers off in a long tail,\r\nwhile numerous branching rootlets spring from its sides. If dug\r\nup in the summer it will be found that a second and younger root\r\n(occasionally a third) is attached to it near its summit by a very\r\nshort branch and is growing out of it on one side. This second root\r\nhas a bud at the top which is destined to produce the stem of the next\r\nseason. It attains its maximum development at the latter part of the\r\nyear, the parent root meanwhile becoming shrivelled and decayed. This\r\nform of growth is therefore analogous to that of an orchis.\r\n\r\nThe dried root is more or less conical or tapering, enlarged and\r\nknotty at the summit which is crowned with the base of the stem.\r\nIt is from 2 to 3 or 4 inches long and at the top from ½ to 1 inch\r\nthick. The tuber-like portion of the root is more slender, much\r\nshrivelled longitudinally, and beset with the prominent bases of\r\nrootlets. The drug is of a dark brown; when dry it breaks with a\r\nshort fracture exhibiting a white and farinaceous, or brownish, or\r\ngrey inner substance sometimes hollow in the centre. A transverse\r\nsection of a sound root shows a pure white central portion (pith)\r\nwhich is many-sided and has at each of its projecting angles a thin\r\nfibro-vascular bundle.\r\n\r\nIn the fresh state the root of aconite has a sharp odour of radish\r\nwhich disappears on drying. Its taste which is at first sweetish soon\r\nbecomes alarmingly acrid, accompanied with sensations of tingling and\r\nnumbness.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The tuberous root as seen in a transverse\r\nsection, consists of a central part enclosed by a delicate cambial\r\nzone. The outer part of this central portion exhibits a thin brownish\r\nlayer made up of a single row of cells (_Kernscheide_ of the Germans).\r\nThis is more distinctly obvious in the rootlets, which also show\r\nnumerous, scattered, thick-walled cells of a yellow colour.\r\n\r\nThe fibro-vascular bundles of aconite root are devoid of true ligneous\r\ncells; its tissue is for the largest part built up of uniform\r\nparenchymatous cells loaded with starch granules.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Aconite contains chemical principles which are\r\nof great interest on account of their virulent effects on the animal\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThe first to be mentioned is _Aconitine_, a highly active\r\ncrystallizable alkaloid, furnishing readily crystallizable salts. It\r\nis accompanied by another active alkaloid, _Pseudaconitine_, which\r\nis crystallizable, but yields mostly amorphous salts. According to\r\nthe admirable researches of Wright and Luff,[39] aconitine may be\r\ndecomposed according to the following equation:—\r\n\r\n    C₃₃H₄₃NO₁₂. OH₂ =    C₇H₆O₂.   C₂₆H₃₉NO₁₁,\r\n    Aconitine.        Benzoic acid.    Aconine.\r\n\r\nand pseudaconitine breaks up in accordance with the equation:\r\n\r\n     C₃₆H₄₉NO₁₁.   OH₂ =    C₉H₁₀O₄.     C₂₇H₄₁NO₈\r\n    Pseudaconitine.        Dimethyl-      Pseudaconine.\r\n                      protocatechnic acid.\r\n\r\n[39] _Pharm. Journ._ 1875 to 1878, also _Yearbook of Pharmacy_, the\r\nresults being summarized in the _Yearbook_ for 1877, 466.—Comparative\r\nqualitative reactions of Aconitine, Aconine, Pseudaconitine, and\r\nPseudaconine, see _Yearbook_ (1877) 459.\r\n\r\nThe decomposition of aconitine, as well as of pseudaconitine, may\r\nbe performed by means of mineral acids, alkaline solutions, or also\r\nby heating the bases with water in sealed tubes. The two alkaloids,\r\n_Aconine_ and _Pseudaconine_, appear to be present already in the\r\nroots of Aconitum; they, moreover, contain two other alkaloids of less\r\nphysiological potency. One of them, _Picraconitine_, C₃₁H₄₅NO₁₀, is\r\nmerely bitter, producing no lip-tingling; it gives well crystallized\r\nsalts, although it is itself amorphous. Commercial aconitine is a\r\nmixture of the above alkaloids. The total yield of basic substances\r\nafforded by aconite root is not more than about 0·07 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe other constituents of aconite root are but imperfectly known. In\r\nthe preparation of the alkaloids, a dark green mixture of resin and\r\nfat is obtained; it is much more abundant in European than in Nepal\r\naconite (Groves). The root contains _Mannite_, as proved by T. and H.\r\nSmith (1850), together with cane-sugar, and another sugar which reduces\r\ncupric oxide even in the cold. Tannin is absent, or is limited to the\r\ncorky coat. The absence of a volatile alkaloid in the root was proved\r\nby Groves in 1866.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Prescribed in the form of tincture as an anodyne liniment;\r\noccasionally given internally in rheumatism.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration and Substitution=—Aconite root, though offered in\r\nabundance in the market, is by no means always obtained of good\r\nquality. Collected in the mountainous parts of Europe by peasants\r\noccupied in the pasturing of sheep and cattle, it is often dug\r\nup without due regard to the proper season or even to the proper\r\nspecies,—a carelessness not surprising when regard is had to the\r\nmiserable price which the drug realizes in the market.[40]\r\n\r\nOne of the species not unfrequent in the Alps, of which the roots\r\nare doubtless sometimes collected, is _A. Störckeanum_ Reichenb. In\r\nthis plant the tuberous roots are developed to the number of three or\r\nfour, and have an anatomical structure slightly different from that\r\nof _A. Napellus_.[41] _A. variegatum_ L., _A. Cammarum Jacq._, and\r\n_A. paniculatum_ Lam. are blue-flowered species having tuberous roots\r\nresembling those of _A. Napellus_, but according to Schroff somewhat\r\nless active.\r\n\r\nThe yellow-flowered _A. Anthora_ L. and _A. Lycoctonum_ L. produce\r\nroots which cannot be confounded with those of _A. Napellus_ L.\r\n\r\nThe root of _A. japonicum_ Thunb. has been noticed in Europe by\r\nChristison as early as 1859[42]; it is now imported occasionally from\r\nthe East. It forms grey or almost blackish tubers from ⁶/₁₀ of an\r\ninch to upwards of 1 inch in length, and from ²/₁₀ to ⁴/₁₀ of an inch\r\nin diameter, oblong or ovoid, either tapering or rounded at their\r\nextremities. They are of plump, scarcely shrivelled appearance.[43]\r\n\r\n_Japanese aconite_ afforded to Wright and Luff a crystallized active\r\nalkaloid different from both aconitine and pseudaconitine.\r\n\r\nHolmes[44] states that the _aromatic_ roots of _Imperatoria Ostruthium_\r\nL. have been found mixed with aconite.\r\n\r\n[40] Thus the continental druggists are able to offer it in quantity as\r\nlow as 4_d._ to 5_d._ per lb., and a pound, we find, contains fully 150\r\nroots!\r\n\r\n[41] See figure in Berg’s _Atlas zur pharm.

The leaves\r\nare from 3 to 5 or more inches in length, nearly half consisting of\r\nthe channelled petiole. The blade, which has a roundish outline, is\r\ndivided down to the petiole into three principal segments, of which the\r\nlateral are subdivided into two or even three, the lowest being smaller\r\nand less regular than the others. The segments, which are trifid, are\r\nfinally cut into 2 to 5 strap-shaped pointed lobes. The leaves are\r\nusually glabrous, and are deeply impressed on their upper side by\r\nveins which run with but few branchings to the tip of every lobe. The\r\nuppermost leaves are more simple than the lower, and gradually pass\r\ninto the bracts of the beautiful raceme of dull-blue helmet-shaped\r\nflowers which crowns the stem.\r\n\r\nThe leaves have when bruised a herby smell; their taste is at first\r\nmawkish but afterwards persistently burning.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The leaves contain aconitine in small proportion\r\nand also aconitic acid,—the latter in combination with lime.\r\n\r\n_Aconitic Acid_, C₁₆H₆O₆, discovered by Peschier in 1820 in somewhat\r\nconsiderable quantity in the leaves of aconite, occurs also in those\r\nof larkspur, and is identical with the _Equisetic Acid_ of Braconnot\r\nand the _Citridic Acid_ of Baup.[45] It has been stated to be present\r\nlikewise in Adonis vernalis L. (Linderos, 1876,—10 per cent. of dried\r\nleaves!) and in the sugar cane (Behr, 1877).\r\n\r\nSchoonbroodt[46] (1867) on treating the extract with a mixture of\r\nalcohol and ether, obtained acicular crystals, which he thought were\r\nthe so-called _Aconella_ of Smith. He further found that the distillate\r\nof the plant was devoid of odour, but was acid, and had a burning\r\ntaste. By saturation with an alkali he obtained from it a crystalline\r\nsubstance, soluble in water, and having a very acrid taste. Experiments\r\nmade about the same time by Groves,[47] a careful observer, led to\r\nopposite results. He distilled on different occasions both fresh herb\r\nand fresh roots, and obtained a _neutral_ distillate, smelling and\r\ntasting strongly of the plant, but entirely devoid of acridity. Hence\r\nhe concluded that _A. Napellus_ contains no volatile acrid principle.\r\n\r\nIn an extract of aconite that has been long kept, the microscope\r\nreveals crystals of aconitate of calcium, as well as of sal-ammoniac.\r\n\r\nThe leaves contain a small proportion of sugar, and a tannin striking\r\ngreen with iron. When dried they yield on incineration 16·6 per cent.\r\nof ash.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—In Britain the leaves and small shoots are only used in the\r\nfresh state, the flowering herb being purchased by the druggist in\r\norder to prepare an inspissated juice,—_Extractum Aconiti_. This\r\npreparation, which is considered rather uncertain in its action, is\r\noccasionally prescribed for the relief of rheumatism, inflammatory and\r\nfebrile affections, neuralgia, and heart diseases.\r\n\r\n[45] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, xi.

Napellus_ L.,\r\nwhich last, as already mentioned, grows throughout Europe as well as\r\nin Northern Asia and America. The roots of these plants are collected\r\nindiscriminately according to Hooker and Thomson[50] under the name of\r\n_Bish_ or _Bikh_.\r\n\r\n=History=—The Sanskrit name of this potent drug, _Visha_, signifies\r\nsimply _poison_, and _Ativisha_, a name which it also bears, is\r\nequivalent to “_summum venenum_.” _Bish_ is mentioned by the Persian\r\nphysician Alhervi[51] in the 10th century as well as by Avicenna[52]\r\nand many other Arabian writers on medicine,—one of whom, Isa Ben Ali,\r\ncalls it the most rapid of deadly poisons, and describes the symptoms\r\nit produces with tolerable correctness.[53]\r\n\r\nUpon the extinction of the Arabian school of medicine this virulent\r\ndrug seems to have fallen into oblivion. It is just named by Acosta\r\n(1578) as one of the ingredients of a pill which the Brahmin physicians\r\ngive in fever and dysentery.[54] There is also a very strange reference\r\nto it as “_Bisch_” in the Persian Pharmacopœia of Father Ange, where\r\nit is stated[55] that the root, though most poisonous when fresh, is\r\nperfectly innocuous when dried, and that it is imported into Persia\r\nfrom India, and _mixed with food and condiments as a restorative_! Ange\r\nwas aware that it was the root of an aconite.\r\n\r\n[48] The Arabic name _Bish_ or Persian _Bis_ is stated by Moodeen\r\nSheriff in his _Supplement to the Pharmacopœia of India_ (p. 265) to be\r\na more correct designation than _Bikh_, which seems to be a corruption\r\nof doubtful origin. We find that the Arabian writer Ibn Baytar gives\r\nthe word as _Bish_ (not _Bikh_).\r\n\r\n[49] Figured in Bentley and Trimen, _Med. Plants_ (1877) pt. 27.\r\n\r\n[50] _Flor. Ind._ i.

The word _bisch_ is\r\ncorrectly given in Arabic characters, so that of its identity there can\r\nbe no dispute. (_Pharm. persica_, see appendix: Angelus.)\r\n\r\nThe poisonous properties of _Bish_ were particularly noticed by\r\nHamilton (late Buchanan)[56] who passed several months in Nepal in\r\n1802-3: but nothing was known of the plant until it was gathered by\r\nWallich and a description of it as _A. ferox_ communicated by Seringe\r\nto the Société de physique de Genève in 1822.[57] Wallich himself\r\nafterwards gave a lengthened account of it in his _Plantæ Asiaticæ\r\nRariores_ (1830).[58]\r\n\r\n=Description=—Balfour, who also figures _A. ferox_,[59] describes\r\nthe plant from a specimen that flowered in the Botanical Garden of\r\nEdinburgh as—“having 2—3 fasciculated, fusiform, attenuated tubers,\r\nsome of the recent ones being nearly 5 inches long, and 1½ inches in\r\ncircumference, dark brown externally, white within, sending off sparse,\r\nlongish branching fibres.”\r\n\r\nAconite root has of late been imported into London from India in\r\nconsiderable quantity, and been offered by the wholesale druggists\r\nas _Nepal Aconite_.[60] It is of very uniform appearance, and seems\r\nderived from a single species, which we suppose to be _A. ferox_. The\r\ndrug consists of simple tuberous roots of an elongated conical form, 3\r\nto 4 inches long, and ½ to 1¾ inches in greatest diameter. Very often\r\nthe roots have been broken in being dug up and are wanting in the\r\nlower extremity: some are nearly as broad at one end as at the other.\r\nThey are mostly flattened and not quite cylindrical, often arched,\r\nmuch shrivelled chiefly in a longitudinal direction, and marked rather\r\nsparsely with the scars of rootlets. The aerial stem has been closely\r\ncut away, and is represented only by a few short scaly rudiments.[61]\r\n\r\nThe roots are of a blackish brown, the prominent portions being\r\noften whitened by friction. In their normal state they are white and\r\nfarinaceous within, but as they are dried by fire-heat and often even\r\nscorched, their interior is generally horny, translucent, and extremely\r\ncompact and hard. The largest root we have met with weighed 555 grains.\r\n\r\nIn the Indian Bazaars, _Bish_ is found in another form, the tuberous\r\nroots having been steeped in cow’s urine to preserve them from\r\ninsects.[62] These roots which in our specimen[63] are mostly plump and\r\ncylindrical, are flexible and moist when fresh, but become hard and\r\nbrittle by keeping. They are externally of very dark colour, black and\r\nhorny within, with an offensive odour resembling that of hyraceum or\r\ncastor. Immersed in water, though only for a few moments, they afford a\r\ndeep brown solution. Such a drug is wholly unfit for use in medicine,\r\nthough not unsuitable, perhaps, for the poisoning of wild beasts, a\r\npurpose to which it is often applied in India.[64]\r\n\r\n[56] _Account of the Kingdom of Nepal_, Edin. 1819, 98.\r\n\r\n[57] _Musée Helvétique d’Hist. Nat._ Berne, i. (1823) 160.\r\n\r\n[58] Yet strange to say confused the plant with _A. Napellus_, an\r\nIndian form of which he figured as _A. ferox_!\r\n\r\n[59] _Edinb. New Phil Journ._ xlvii. (1849) 366, pl. 5.\r\n\r\n[60] The first importation was in 1869, when ten bags containing 1,000\r\nlbs., said to be part of a much larger quantity actually in London,\r\nwere offered for sale by a drug-broker.\r\n\r\n[61] There is a rude woodcut of the root in _Pharm. Journ._ i. (1871)\r\n434.\r\n\r\n[62] A specimen of ordinary _Bish_ in my possession for two or three\r\nyears became much infested by a minute and active insect of the genus\r\n_Psocus_.—D. H.\r\n\r\n[63] Obligingly sent to me in 1867 by Messrs. Rogers & Co. of Bombay,\r\nwho say it is the only kind there procurable.—D. H.\r\n\r\n[64] According to Moodeen Sheriff (_Supplement to Pharm. of India_, pp.\r\n25-32, 265) there are several kinds of aconite root found in the Indian\r\nbazaars, some of them highly poisonous, others innocuous. The first or\r\npoisonous aconites he groups under the head _Aconitum ferox_, while the\r\nsecond, of which there are three varieties mostly known by the Arabic\r\nname _Jadvár_ (Persian _Zadvár_), he refers to undetermined species of\r\n_Aconitum_.\r\n\r\nThe surest and safest names in most parts of India for the poisonous\r\naconite roots are _Bish_ (Arabic); _Bis_ (Persian); _Singyā-bis_,\r\n_Mīthā-zahar_, _Bachhnāg_ (Hindustani); _Vasha-nāvi_ (Tamil);\r\n_Vasa-nābhi_ (Malyalim).\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—Most of the roots fail to display any\r\ncharacteristic structure by reason of the heat to which they have\r\nbeen subjected. A living root sent to us from the Botanical Garden of\r\nEdinburgh exhibited the thin brownish layer which encloses the central\r\npart in _A. Napellus_, replaced by a zone of stone-cells,—a feature\r\ndiscernible in the imported root.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—According to Wright and Luff (see previous\r\narticle) the roots of _Aconitum ferox_ contain comparatively large\r\nquantities of pseudaconitine with a little aconitine and an alkaloid,\r\napparently non-crystalline, which would appear not to agree with the\r\nanalogous body from _A. Napellus_.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The drug has been imported and used as a source of aconitine. It\r\nis commonly believed to be much more potent than the aconite root of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX ACONITI HETEROPHYLLI.\r\n\r\n_Atís or Atees._\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Aconitum heterophyllum_ Wallich, a plant of 1 to 3\r\nfeet high with a raceme of large flowers of a dull yellow veined with\r\npurple, or altogether blue, and reniform or cordate, obscurely 5-lobed,\r\nradical leaves.[65] It grows at elevations of 8000 to 13,000 feet in\r\nthe temperate regions of the Western Himalaya, as in Simla, Kumaon and\r\nKashmír.\r\n\r\n=History=—We have not met with any ancient account of this drug, which\r\nhowever is stated by O’Shaughnessy[66] to have been long celebrated in\r\nIndian medicine as a tonic and aphrodisiac. It has recently attracted\r\nsome attention on account of its powers as an antiperiodic in fevers,\r\nand has been extensively prescribed by European physicians in India.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The tuberous roots of _A. heterophyllum_ are ovoid,\r\noblong, and downward-tapering or obconical; they vary in length from\r\n½ to 1½ inches and in diameter from ³/₁₀ to ⁶/₁₀ of an inch, and\r\nweigh from 5 to 45 grains. They are of a light ash colour, wrinkled\r\nand marked with scars of rootlets, and have scaly rudiments of leaves\r\nat the summit. Internally they are pure white and farinaceous. A\r\ntransverse section shows a homogeneous tissue with 4 to 7 yellowish\r\nvascular bundles. In a longitudinal section these bundles are seen to\r\ntraverse the root from the scar of the stem to the opposite pointed\r\nend, here and there giving off a rootlet. The taste of the root is\r\nsimply bitter with no acridity.\r\n\r\n[65] Beautifully figured in Royle’s _Illustrations of the Botany of the\r\nHimalayan mountains_, &c., 1839, tab. 13; also in Bentley and Trimen’s\r\n_Medicinal Plants_, Part 27 (1877).\r\n\r\n[66] _Bengal Dispensatory_, 1842. 167.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The tissue is formed of large angular\r\nthin-walled cells loaded with starch which is either in the form of\r\nisolated or compound granules. The vascular bundles contain numerous\r\nspiroid vessels which seen in transverse section appear arranged so as\r\nto form about four rays. The outer coat of the root is made up of about\r\nsix rows of compressed, tabular cells with faintly brownish walls.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The root contains _Atisine_, an amorphous\r\nalkaloid of intensely bitter taste discovered by Broughton,[67] who\r\nassigns to it the formula C₄₆H₇₄N₂O₅, obtained from concurrent analysis\r\nof a platinum salt. The alkaloid is readily soluble in bisulphide of\r\ncarbon or in benzol, also to some extent in water. It is of decidedly\r\nalkaline reaction, devoid of any acridity. Atisine has also been\r\nprepared (1877) by Dunin[68] from the root in the laboratory of one of\r\nus. We have before us its hydroiodate, forming colourless crystallized\r\nscales, which we find to be very sparingly soluble in cold alcohol or\r\nwater. At boiling temperature the hydroiodate of atisine is readily\r\ndissolved; the aqueous solution on cooling yields beautiful crystals.\r\nThey agree, according to Dunin, with the formula C₄₆H₇₄N₂O₄. HI + OH₂;\r\nthis chemist has also shown atisine not to be poisonous. The absence in\r\nthe drug of aconitine is proved by medical experience,[69] and fully\r\nconfirmed by the absence of any acridity in the root.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The drug is stated to have proved a valuable remedy in\r\nintermittent and other paroxysmal fevers. In ordinary intermittents it\r\nmay be given in powder in 20-grain doses. As a simple tonic the dose is\r\n5 to 10 grains thrice a day.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—The native name _Atís_ applied in India to several other\r\ndrugs, one of which is an inert tasteless root commonly referred to\r\n_Asparagus sarmentosus_ L. In Kunawar the tubers of _Aconitum Napellus_\r\nL. are dug up and eaten as a tonic, the name _atís_ being applied to\r\nthem as well as to those of _A. heterophyllum_.[70]\r\n\r\n[67] _Pharm.

Plants_, Part 23 (1877).\r\n\r\n=History=—The plant was first made known by Plukenet in 1696 as\r\n_Christophoriana Canadensis racemosa_. It was recommended in 1743 by\r\nColden[72] and named in 1749 by Linnæus in his _Materia Medica_ as\r\n_Actæa racemis longissimis_. In 1823 it was introduced into medical\r\npractice in America by Garden; it began to be used in England about the\r\nyear 1860.[73]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The drug consists of a very short, knotty, branching\r\nrhizome, ½ an inch or more thick, having, in one direction, the remains\r\nof several stout aerial stems, and in the other, numerous brittle,\r\nwiry roots, ¹/₂₀ to ⅒ of an inch in diameter, emitting rootlets still\r\nsmaller. The rhizome is of somewhat flattened cylindrical form,\r\ndistinctly marked at intervals with the scars of fallen leaves. A\r\ntransverse section exhibits in the centre a horny whitish pith, round\r\nwhich are a number of rather coarse, irregular woody rays, and outside\r\nthem a hard, thickish bark. The larger roots when broken display a\r\nthick cortical layer, the space within which contains converging wedges\r\nof open woody tissue 3 to 5 in number forming a star or cross,—a\r\nbeautiful and characteristic structure easily observed with a lens. The\r\ndrug is of a dark blackish brown; it has a bitter, rather acrid and\r\nastringent taste, and a heavy narcotic smell.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The most striking character is afforded by the\r\nrootlets, which on a transverse section display a central woody column,\r\ntraversed usually by 4 wide medullary rays and often enclosing a pith.\r\nThe woody column is surrounded by a parenchymatous layer separated\r\nfrom the cortical portion by one row of densely packed small cells\r\nconstituting a boundary analogous to the nucleus-sheath (_Kernscheide_)\r\nmet with in many roots of monocotyledons, as for instance in\r\nsarsaparilla. The parenchyme of cimicifuga root contains small starch\r\ngranules. The structure of the drug is, on the whole, the same as that\r\nof the closely allied European _Actæa spicata_ L.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Tilghmann[74] in 1834 analysed the drug,\r\nobtaining from it gum, sugar, resin, starch and tannic acid, but no\r\npeculiar principal.\r\n\r\nConard[75] extracted from it a neutral crystalline substance of\r\nintensely acrid taste, soluble in dilute alcohol, chloroform, or ether,\r\nbut not in benzol, oil of turpentine, or bisulphide of carbon. The\r\ncomposition of this body has not been ascertained. The same chemist\r\nshowed the drug not to afford a volatile principle, even in its fresh\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe American practitioners called _Eclectics_ prepare with _Black\r\nSnake-root_ in the same manner as they prepare podophyllin, an impure\r\nresin which they term _Cimicifugin_ or _Macrotin_. The drug yields,\r\naccording to Parrish, 3¾ per cent. of this substance, which is sold in\r\nthe form of scales or as a dark brown powder.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Cimicifuga usually prescribed in the form of tincture (called\r\n_Tinctura Actæa racemosæ_) has been employed chiefly in rheumatic\r\naffections. It is also used in dropsy, the early stages of phthisis,\r\nand in chronic bronchial disease. A strong tincture has been lately\r\nrecommended in America as an external application for reducing\r\ninflammation.[76]\r\n\r\n[72] _Acta Soc. Reg. Scient.

It\r\npresents considerable variation in form and size of leaf and flower in\r\nthe different countries in which it occurs, on which account it has\r\nreceived from botanists several distinct specific names. Hooker[78]\r\nhas reduced these species to a single type, a course in which he\r\nhas been followed by Eichler in his monograph of the small order\r\n_Winteraceæ_[79].—In April, 1877, the tree was blossoming in the open\r\nair in the botanic garden at Dublin.\r\n\r\n[77] From δριμὺς, _acrid_, _biting_.\r\n\r\n[78] _Flora Antarctica_, ii.

Eichler however admits\r\nfive principal varieties, viz. α. _Magellanica_; β. _Chilensis_; γ.\r\n_Granatensis_; δ. _revoluta_; ε. _angustifolia_.\r\n\r\n=History=—In 1577 Captain Drake, afterwards better known as Sir Francis\r\nDrake, having obtained from Queen Elizabeth a commission to conduct a\r\nsquadron to the South Seas, set sail from Plymouth with five ships; and\r\nhaving abandoned two of his smaller vessels, passed into the Pacific\r\nOcean by the Straits of Magellan in the autumn of the following year.\r\nBut on the 7th September, 1578, there arose a dreadful storm, which\r\ndispersed the little fleet. Drake’s ship, the _Pelican_, was driven\r\nsouthward, the _Elizabeth_, under the command of Captain Winter,\r\nrepassed the Straits and returned to England, while the third vessel,\r\nthe _Marigold_, was heard of no more.\r\n\r\nWinter remained three weeks in the Straits of Magellan to recover the\r\nhealth of his crew, during which period, according to Clusius (the fact\r\nis not mentioned in Hakluyt’s account of the voyage), he collected\r\na certain aromatic bark, of which, having removed the acridity by\r\nsteeping it in honey, he made use as a spice and medicine for scurvy\r\nduring his voyage to England, where he arrived in 1579.\r\n\r\nA specimen of this bark having been presented to Clusius, he gave it\r\nthe name of _Cortex Winteranus_, and figured and described it in his\r\npamphlet: “Aliquot notæ in Garciæ aromatum historiam,” Antverpiæ,\r\n1582, p. 30, and also in the _Libri Exoticorum_, published in 1605.\r\nHe afterwards received a specimen with wood attached, which had been\r\ncollected by the Dutch navigator Sebald de Weerdt.\r\n\r\nVan Noort, another well-known Dutch navigator, who visited the Straits\r\nof Magellan in 1600, mentions cutting wood at Port Famine to make a\r\nboat, and that the bark of the trees was hot and biting like pepper. It\r\nis stated by Murray that he also brought the bark to Europe.\r\n\r\nBut although the straits of Magellan were several times visited about\r\nthis period, it is certain that no regular communication between\r\nthat remote region and Europe existed either then or subsequently;\r\nand we may reasonably conclude that Winter’s Bark became a drug of\r\ngreat rarity, and known to but few persons. It thus happened that,\r\nnotwithstanding most obvious differences, the Canella alba of the West\r\nIndies, and another bark of which we shall speak further on, having\r\nbeen found to possess the pungency of Winter’s Bark, were (owing to\r\nthe scarcity of the latter) substituted for it, until at length the\r\npeculiar characters of the original drug came to be entirely forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe tree was figured by Sloane in 1693, from a specimen (still extant\r\nin the British Museum) brought from Magellan’s Straits by Handisyd, a\r\nship’s surgeon, who had experienced its utility in treating scurvy.\r\n\r\nFeuillée,[80] a French botanist, found the Winter’s Bark-tree in Chili\r\n(1709-11), and figured it as _Boigue cinnamomifera_. It was, however,\r\nForster,[81] the botanist of Cook’s second expedition round the\r\nworld, who first described the tree accurately, and named it _Drimys\r\nWinteri_. He met with it in 1773 in Magellan’s Straits, and on the\r\neastern coasts of Tierra del Fuego, where it grows abundantly, forming\r\nan evergreen tree of 40 feet, while on the western shores it is but\r\na shrub of 10 feet high. Specimens have been collected in these and\r\nadjacent localities by many subsequent botanists, among others by Dr.\r\nJ. D. Hooker, who states that about Cape Horn the tree occurs from the\r\nsea-level to an elevation of 1000 feet.\r\n\r\nAlthough the bark of _Drimys_ was never imported as an article of trade\r\nfrom Magellan’s Straits, it has in recent times been occasionally\r\nbrought into the market from other parts of South America, where it is\r\nin very general use. Yet so little are drug dealers acquainted with it,\r\nthat its true name and origin have seldom been recognized.[82]\r\n\r\n[80] _Journ. des observations physiques_, &c. iv. 1714. 10, pl. 6.\r\n\r\n[81] _Characteres Generum Plantarum_, 1775. 42.\r\n\r\n[82] We have seen it offered in a drug sale at one time as “_Pepper\r\nBark_,” at another as “_Cinchona_.” Even Mutis thought it a Cinchona,\r\nand called it “_Kinkina urens_”!\r\n\r\n=Description=—We have examined specimens of true Winter’s Bark from the\r\nStraits of Magellan, Chili, Peru, New Granada, and Mexico, and find in\r\neach the same general characters. The bark is in quills or channelled\r\npieces, often crooked, twisted or bent backwards, generally only a few\r\ninches in length. It is most extremely thick (⅒ to ³/₁₀ of an inch) and\r\nappears to have shrunk very much in drying, bark a quarter of an inch\r\nthick having sometimes rolled itself into a tube only three times as\r\nmuch in external diameter. Young pieces have an ashy-grey suberous coat\r\nbeset with lichens. In older bark, the outer coat is sometimes whitish\r\nand silvery, but more often of a dark rusty brown, which is the colour\r\nof the internal substance, as well as of the surface next the wood. The\r\ninner side of the bark is strongly characterized by very rough striæ,\r\nor, as seen under a lens, by small short and sharp longitudinal ridges,\r\nwith occasional fissures indicative of great contraction of the inner\r\nlayer in drying. In a piece broken or cut transversely, it is easy to\r\nperceive that the ridges in question are the ends of rays of white\r\nliber which diverge towards the circumference in radiate order, a dark\r\nrusty parenchyme intervening between them. No such feature is ever\r\nobservable in either _Canella_ or _Cinnamodendron_.\r\n\r\nWinter’s Bark has a short, almost earthy fracture, an intolerably\r\npungent burning taste, and an odour which can only be described as\r\nterebinthinous. When fresh its smell may be more agreeable. The\r\ndescriptions of Clusius, as alluded to above, are perfectly agreeing\r\nand even his figures as nearly as might be expected.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—In full-grown specimens the most striking fact\r\nis the predominance of sclerenchymatous cells. The tissue moreover\r\ncontains numerous large oil-ducts, chiefly in the inner portion of the\r\nlarge medullary rays. A fibrous structure of the inner part of the bark\r\nis observable only in the youngest specimens.[83] Very small starch\r\ngranules are met with in the drug, yet less numerous than in canella.\r\nThe tissue of the former assumes a blackish blue colour on addition of\r\nperchloride of iron.\r\n\r\nThe wood of _Drimys_ consists of dotted prosenchyme, traversed by\r\nmedullary rays, the cells of which are punctuated and considerably\r\nlarger than in _Coniferæ_.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—No satisfactory chemical examination has been\r\nmade of true Winter’s Bark. Its chief constituents, as already pointed\r\nout, are tannic matters and essential oil, probably also a resin. In a\r\ncold aqueous infusion, a considerable amount of mucilage is indicated\r\nby neutral acetate of lead. On addition of potash it yields a dark\r\nsomewhat violet liquid. Canella alba is but little altered by the same\r\ntreatment. By reason of its astringency the bark is used in Chili for\r\ntanning.[84]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Winter’s Bark is a stimulating tonic and antiscorbutic, now\r\nalmost obsolete in Europe. It is much used in Brazil and other parts of\r\nSouth America as a remedy in diarrhœa and gastric debility.\r\n\r\n=Substitute=—_False Winter’s Bark_—We have shown that the bark of\r\n_Drimys_ or True Winter’s Bark has been confounded with the pungent\r\nbark of _Canella alba_ L., and with an allied bark, also the produce of\r\nJamaica. The latter is that of _Cinnamodendron corticosum_ Miers,[85] a\r\ntree growing in the higher mountain woods of St. Thomas-in-the-Vale and\r\nSt. John, but not observed in any other of the West Indian islands than\r\nJamaica. It was probably vaguely known to Sloane when he described the\r\n“_Wild Cinamon tree, commonly, but falsely, called_ Cortex Winteranus,”\r\nwhich, he says, has leaves resembling those of _Lauro-cerasus_; though\r\nthe tree he figures is certainly _Canella alba_.[86] Long[87] in\r\n1774, speaks of _Wild Cinamon_, _Canella alba_, or _Bastard Cortex\r\nWinteranus_, saying that it is used by most apothecaries instead of the\r\ntrue _Cortex Winteranus_.\r\n\r\n[83] The structure of Winter’s Bark is beautifully figured by Eichler,\r\n_loc. cit._ tab. 32.\r\n\r\n[84] Perez-Rosales, _Essai sur le Chili_, 1857. 113.\r\n\r\n[85] _Annals of Nat.

Guibourt indeed pointed out in 1850 its great\r\ndissimilarity to the bark of _Drimys_ and questioned if it could be\r\nderived from that genus.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange fact that the tree should have been confounded with\r\n_Canella alba_ L., differing from it as it does in the most obvious\r\nmanner, not only in form of leaf, but in having the flowers _axillary_,\r\nwhereas those of _C. alba_ are _terminal_. Although _Cinnamodendron\r\ncorticosum_ is a tree sometimes as much as 90 feet high[91] and must\r\nhave been well known in Jamaica for more than a century, yet it had\r\nno botanical name until 1858 when it was described by Miers[92] and\r\nreferred to the small genus _Cinnamodendron_ which is closely allied to\r\n_Canella_.\r\n\r\nThe bark of _Cinnamodendron_ has the general structure of Canella alba.\r\nThere is the same thin corky outer coat (which is _not_ removed) dotted\r\nwith round scars, the same form of quills and fracture. But the tint is\r\ndifferent, being more or less of a ferruginous brown. The inner surface\r\nwhich is a little more fibrous than in canella, varies in colour, being\r\nyellowish, brown, or of a deep chocolate. The bark is violently pungent\r\nbut not bitter, and has a very agreeable cinnamon-like odour.\r\n\r\nIn _microscopic structure_ it approaches very close to canella; yet\r\nthe thick-walled cells of the latter exist to a much larger extent and\r\nare here seen to belong to the suberous tissue. The medullary rays are\r\nloaded with oxalate of calcium.\r\n\r\nCinnamodendron bark has not been analysed. Its decoction is blackened\r\nby a persalt of iron whereby it may be distinguished from Canella alba;\r\nand is coloured intense purplish brown by iodine, which is not the case\r\nwith a decoction of true Winter’s Bark.\r\n\r\n[88] It is so labelled in the Museum of the Pharmaceutical Society,\r\n28th April, 1873.\r\n\r\n[89] _Pharm. Waarenkunde_, 1827-29. i. Taf. 3. fig. 7.\r\n\r\n[90] As shown by De Lens’ own specimen kindly given to us by Dr. J.\r\nLéon Soubeiran. There are specimens of the same bark about a century\r\nold marked _Cortex Winteranus verus_ in Dr. Burges’s cabinet of drugs\r\nbelonging to the Royal College of Physicians.\r\n\r\n[91] Griesbach calls it a low shrubby tree, 10-15 feet high. Mr. N.\r\nWilson, late of the Bath Botanic Garden, Jamaica, has informed me it\r\ngrows to be 40-45 in height, but that he has seen a specimen 90 feet\r\nhigh. (Letter 22 May 1862.)—D.

A small tree, 20 to 25 feet high, native of the south-western\r\nprovinces of China; introduced at an early period into Japan by the\r\nBuddhists and planted about their temples.\r\n\r\nKämpfer in his travels in Japan, in 1690-1692, discovered and figured a\r\ntree called _Somo_ or _Skimmi_[94] which subsequent authors assumed to\r\nbe the source of the drug Star-anise. The tree was also found in Japan\r\nby Thunberg[95] who remarked that its capsules are not so aromatic as\r\nthose found in trade. Von Siebold in 1825 noticed the same fact, in\r\nconsequence of which he regarded the tree as distinct from that of\r\nLoureiro, naming it _Illicium Japonicum_, a name he changed in 1837\r\nto _I. religiosum_. Baillon,[96] while admitting certain differences\r\nbetween the fruits of the Chinese and Japanese trees, holds them to\r\nconstitute but one species, and the same view is taken by Miquel.[97]\r\n\r\n[93] From the Arabic _Bádiyán fennel_.\r\n\r\n[94] _Amœnitates_, 1712. 880.\r\n\r\n[95] _Flora Japonica_, 1784. 235.\r\n\r\n[96] _Adansonia_, vHist. des Plantes, Magnoliacées_, 1868. 154.\r\n\r\n[97] _Ann.

(1865-1866). 257.\r\n\r\nThe star-anise of commerce is produced in altitudes of 2500 metres in\r\nthe north-western parts of the province of Yunnan in South-western\r\nChina where the tree, which attains a height of 12 to 15 feet, grows in\r\nabundance.[98] The fruits of the Japanese variety of the tree are not\r\ncollected, and the Chinese drug alone is in use even in Japan.\r\n\r\n=History=—Notwithstanding its striking appearance, there is no evidence\r\nthat star-anise found its way to Europe like other Eastern spices\r\nduring the middle ages. Concerning its ancient use in China, the only\r\nfact we have found recorded is, that during the Sung dynasty, A.D.\r\n970-1127, star-anise was levied as tribute in the southern part of\r\nKien-chow, now Yen-ping-fu, in Fokien.[99]\r\n\r\nStar-anise was brought to England from the Philippines by the\r\nvoyager Candish, about A.D. 1588. Clusius obtained it in London from\r\nthe apothecary Morgan and the druggist Garet, and described it in\r\n1601.[100] The drug appears to have been rare in the time of Pomet,\r\nwho states (1694) that the Dutch use it to flavour their beverages of\r\ntea and “sorbec.”[101] In those times it was brought to Europe by way\r\nof Russia, and was thence called _Cardamomum Siberiense_, or _Annis de\r\nSibérie_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit of _Illicium anisatum_ is formed of 8\r\none-seeded carpels, originally upright, but afterwards spread into\r\na radiate whorl and united in a single row round a short central\r\ncolumn which proceeds from an oblique pedicel. When ripe they are\r\nwoody and split longitudinally at the upturned ventral suture, so\r\nthat the shining seed becomes visible. This seed, which is elliptical\r\nand somewhat flattened, stands erect in the carpel; it is truncated\r\non the side adjoining the central column, and is there attached by\r\nan obliquely-rising funicle. The upper edge of the seed is keeled,\r\nthe lower rounded. The boat-shaped carpels, to the number of 8, are\r\nattached to the column through their whole height, but adhere to each\r\nother only slightly at the base; the upper or split side of each carpel\r\noccupies a nearly horizontal position. The carpels are irregularly\r\nwrinkled, especially below, and are more or less beaked at the apex;\r\ntheir colour is a rusty brown. Internally they are of a brighter\r\ncolour, smooth, and with a cavity in the lower half corresponding to\r\nthe shape of the seed. The cavity is formed of a separate wall, ½\r\nmillim. thick, which, as well as the testa of the seed, distinctly\r\nexhibits a radiate structure. The small embryo lies next the hilum in\r\nthe soft albumen, which is covered by a dark brown endopleura. The\r\nseed, which is not much aromatic, amounts to about one-fifth of the\r\nentire weight of the fruit.\r\n\r\n[98] Thorel, _Notes Médicales du voyage d’exploration du Mékong et\r\nde Cochinchine_, Paris, 1870. 31.—Garnier, _Voyage d’exploration en\r\nIndo-Chine II._ (Paris, 1873) 439.—Rondot, _Etude pratique du commerce\r\nd’exportation de la Chine_, 1848. 11.\r\n\r\n[99] Bretschneider in (Foochow) _Chinese Recorder_, Jan., 1871, 220,\r\nreprinted in his “Study and Value of Chinese Botanical Works,” Foochow,\r\n1872, 13.—See also Hirth du Frênes, in _New Remedies_, New York, 1877,\r\n181.\r\n\r\n[100] _Rarior.

Hist._ 202.\r\n\r\n[101] _Hist. des Drog._ pt. i. liv. i. 43.\r\n\r\nStar-anise has an agreeable aromatic taste and smell, more resembling\r\nfennel than anise, on which account it was at first designated\r\n_Fœniculum Sinense_.[102] When pulverised, it has a subacid after-taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The carpels consist of an external, loose,\r\ndark brown layer and a thick inner wall, separated by fibro-vascular\r\nbundles. The outer layer exhibits numerous large cells, containing\r\npale yellow volatile oil. The inner wall of the carpels consists of\r\nwoody prosenchyme in those parts which are exterior to the seed cavity,\r\nand especially in the shining walls laid bare by the splitting of the\r\nventral suture. The inner surface of the carpel is entirely composed\r\nof sclerenchyme. A totally different structure is exhibited by this\r\nstony shell where it lines the cavity occupied by the seed. Here it\r\nis composed of a single row of cells, consisting of straight tubes\r\nexactly parallel to one another, more than 500 mkm. long, and 70\r\nmkm. in diameter, placed vertically to the seed cavity; their porous\r\nwalls, marked with fine spiral striations, display splendid colours in\r\npolarized light. The seed contains albumen and drops of fat. Starch is\r\nwanting in star-anise, except a little in the fruit-stalk.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The volatile oil amounts to four or five per\r\ncent. Its composition is that of the oils of fennel or anise. We\r\nobserved that oil of star-anise, as distilled by one of us, continued\r\nfluid below 8° C. It solidified at that temperature as soon as a\r\ncrystal of anethol (see our article on Fructus Anisi) was brought in\r\ncontact with the oil. The crystallized mass began to melt again at\r\n16° C. The oils of anise and star-anise possess no striking optical\r\ndifferences, both deviating very little to the left. We are unable\r\nto give any chemical characters by which they can be discriminated,\r\nalthough they are distinguished by dealers; the oil of star-anise\r\nimparts a somewhat different flavour, for instance, to drinks than that\r\nproduced by anise oil.\r\n\r\nStar-anise is rich in sugar, which seems to be cane-sugar inasmuch as\r\nit does not reduce alkaline cupric tartrate. An aqueous extract of the\r\nfruit assumes, on addition of alcohol, the form of a clear mucilaginous\r\njelly, of which pectin is probably a constituent. The seeds contain a\r\nlarge quantity of fixed oil.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Star-anise is shipped to Europe and India from China. In\r\n1872 Shanghai imported, mostly by way of Hong Kong 5273 peculs (703,066\r\nlb.), a large proportion of which was re-shipped to other ports of\r\nChina.[103] According to Rondot (_l. c._) the best is first brought by\r\njunks from Fokien to Canton, being exported from Tsiouen-tchou-fou.\r\nA little is also collected in Kiangsi and Kuang-tung. The same drug,\r\nunder the name of _Bādiyāne-khatāi_ (i.e. _Chinese fennel_), is carried\r\nby inland trade from China to Yarkand and thence to India, where it is\r\nmuch esteemed.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Star-anise is employed to flavour spirits, the principal\r\nconsumption being in Germany, France, and Italy. It is not used in\r\nmedicine at least in England, except in the form of essential oil,\r\nwhich is often sold for oil of aniseed.\r\n\r\n[102] Redi, _Experimenta_, Amstelod. 1675, p. 172.\r\n\r\n[103] _Returns of Trade at the Treaty Ports in China for 1872_, 4-8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMENISPERMACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX CALUMBÆ.\r\n\r\n_Radix Columba_; _Calumba or Colombo Root_; F. _Racine de Colombo_; G.\r\n_Kalumbawurzel_, _Columbowurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Jateorhiza palmata_ Miers[104] a diœcious perennial\r\nplant, with large fleshy roots and herbaceous annual stems, climbing\r\nover bushes and to the tops of lofty trees. The leaves are of large\r\nsize and on long stalks, palmate-lobed and membranous. The male flowers\r\nare in racemose panicles a foot or more in length, setose-hispid at\r\nleast in their lower part, or nearly glabrous. The whole part is more\r\nor less hispid with spreading setæ and glandular hairs.\r\n\r\nIt is indigenous to the forests of Eastern Africa between Ibo or Oibo,\r\nthe most northerly of the Portuguese settlements (lat. 12° 28′ S.), and\r\nthe banks of the Zambesi, a strip of coast which includes the towns\r\nof Mozambique and Quilimane. Kirk found it (1860) in abundance at\r\nShupanga, among the hills near Morambala, at Kebrabasa and near Senna,\r\nlocalities all in the region of the Zambesi. Peters[105] states that on\r\nthe islands of Ibo and Mozambique the plant is cultivated. In the Kew\r\nHerbarium is a specimen from the interior of Madagascar.\r\n\r\nThe plant was introduced into Mauritius a century ago in the time of\r\nthe French governor Le Poivre, but seems to have been lost, for after\r\nmany attempts it was again introduced in 1825 by living specimens\r\nprocured from Ibo by Captain Owen.[106] It still thrives there in the\r\nBotanical Garden of Pamplemousses.\r\n\r\nIt was taken from Mozambique to India in 1805 and afterwards cultivated\r\nby Roxburgh in the Calcutta Garden, where however it has long ceased to\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n[104] Synonyms—_Menispermum palmatum_ Lamarck, _Cocculus palmatus_ DC,\r\n_Menispermum Columba_ Roxb., _Jateorhiza Calumba_ Miers, _J. Miersii_\r\nOliv., _Chasmanthera Columba_ Baillon. As we thus suppress a species\r\nadmitted in recent works, it is necessary to give the following\r\nexplanation. _Menispermum palmatum_ of Lamarck, first described in\r\nthe _Encyclopédie méthodique_ in 1797 (iv. 99), was divided by Miers\r\ninto two species, _Jateorhiza palmata_ and _J. Calumba_. Oliver in his\r\n_Flora of Tropical Africa_, i. (1868) 42, accepted the view taken by\r\nMiers, but to avoid confusion abolished the specific name _palmata_,\r\nsubstituting for it that of _Miersii_. At the same time he noticed\r\nthe close relationship of the two species, and suggested that further\r\ninvestigation might warrant their union. The characters supposed to\r\ndistinguish them _inter se_ are briefly these:—In _J. palmata_, the\r\nlobes at the base of the leaf _overlap_, and the male inflorescence is\r\nnearly glabrous; while in _J. Calumba_, the basal lobes are rounded,\r\nbut _do not overlap_, and the male inflorescence is setose-hispid\r\n(“_sparsely pilose_” Miers). On careful examination of a large number\r\nof specimens, including those of Berry from Calcutta, and others from\r\nMauritius, Madagascar, and the Zambesi, together with the drawings of\r\nTelfair and Roxburgh, and the published figures and descriptions, I\r\nam convinced that the characters in question are unimportant and do\r\nnot warrant the establishment of two species. In this view I have the\r\nsupport of Mr. Horne of Mauritius, who at my request has made careful\r\nobservations on the living plant and found that both forms of leaf\r\noccur on the same stem.—D.

(1830) tabb. 2970-71.\r\n\r\n=History=—The root is held in high esteem among the natives of Eastern\r\nAfrica who call it _Kalumb_, and use it for the cure of dysentery and\r\nas a general remedy for almost any disorder.\r\n\r\nIt was brought to Europe by the Portuguese in the 17th century, and is\r\nfirst noticed briefly in 1671 by Francesco Redi, who speaks of it[107]\r\nas an antidote to poison deserving trial.\r\n\r\nNo further attention was paid to the drug for nearly a century, when\r\nPercival[108] in 1773 re-introduced it as “_a medicine of considerable\r\nefficacy ... not so generally known in practice as it deserves to be_.”\r\nFrom this period it began to come into general use. J. Gurney Bevan,\r\na London druggist, writing to a correspondent in 1777 alludes to it\r\nas—“an article not yet much dealt in and subject to great fluctuation.”\r\nIt was in fact at this period extremely dear, and in Mr. Bevan’s\r\nstock-books is valued in 1776 and 1777 at 30_s._ per lb., in 1780 at\r\n28_s._, 1781 at 64_s._, 1782 at 15_s._, 1783 at 6_s._ Calumba was\r\nadmitted to the _London Pharmacopœia_ in 1788.\r\n\r\n=Collection=—As to the collection and preparation of the drug for the\r\nmarket, the only account we possess is that obtained by Dr. Berry,[109]\r\nwhich states that the roots are dug up in the month of March, which is\r\nthe dry season, cut into slices and dried in the shade.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The calumba plant produces great fusiform fleshy roots\r\ngrowing several together from a short head. Some fresh specimens sent\r\nto one of us (H.) from the Botanic Garden, Mauritius, in 1866, and\r\nothers from that of Trinidad in 1868, were portions of cylindrical\r\nroots, 3 to 4 inches in diameter, externally rough and brown and\r\ninternally firm, fleshy, and of a brilliant yellow. When sliced\r\ntransversely, and dried by a gentle heat, these roots exactly resemble\r\nimported calumba except for being much fresher and brighter.\r\n\r\nThe calumba of commerce consists of irregular flattish pieces of a\r\ncircular or oval outline, 1 to 2 inches or more in diameter, and ⅛ to\r\n½ an inch thick. In drying, the central portion contracts more than\r\nthe exterior: hence the pieces are thinnest in the middle. The outer\r\nedge is invested with a brown wrinkled layer which covers a corky bark\r\nabout ⅜ of an inch thick, surrounding a pithless internal substance,\r\nfrom which it is separated by a fine dark shaded line. The pieces are\r\nlight and of a corky texture, easily breaking with a mealy fracture.\r\nTheir colour is a dull greenish yellow, brighter when the outer surface\r\nis shaved off with a knife.[110] The drug has a weak musty odour and\r\na rather nauseous bitter taste. It often arrives much perforated by\r\ninsects, but seems not liable to such depredations here.\r\n\r\n[107] “Sono ancora da farsi nuove esperienze intorno alla _radice di\r\nCalumbe_, creduta un grandissimo alessifarmaco.”—_Esperienze_, p. 125.\r\n(See Appendix, R.)\r\n\r\n[108] _Essays Medical and Experimental_, Lond. ii. (1773) 3.\r\n\r\n[109] _Asiatick Researches_, x. (1808) 385; Ainslie, _Mat. Med. of\r\nHindoostan_, 298.\r\n\r\n[110] Wholesale druggists sometimes _wash_ the drug to improve its\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—On a transverse section the root exhibits\r\na circle of radiate vascular bundles only in the layer immediately\r\nconnected with the cambial zone; they project much less distinctly\r\ninto the cortical part. The tissue of the whole root, except the cork\r\nand vascular bundles, is made up of large parenchymatous cells. In\r\nthe outer part of the bark,— some of them have their yellow walls\r\nthickened and are loaded with fine crystals of oxalate of calcium,\r\nwhilst all the other cells contain very large starch granules,\r\nattaining as much as 90 mkm. The short fracture of the root is due to\r\nthe absence of a proper ligneous or liber tissue.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The bitter taste of calumba, and probably\r\nlikewise its medicinal properties, are due to three distinct\r\nsubstances, _Columbin_, _Berberine_, and _Columbic Acid_.\r\n\r\n_Columbin_, or _Columba-Bitter_ was discovered by Wittstock in 1830.\r\nIt is a neutral bitter principle, crystallizing in colourless rhombic\r\nprisms, slightly soluble in cold alcohol or ether, but dissolving more\r\nfreely in those liquids when boiling. It is soluble in aqueous alkalis\r\nand in acetic acid.\r\n\r\nThe presence of _Berberine_ in calumba was ascertained in 1848 by\r\nBödeker, who showed that the yellow cell-walls of the root owe their\r\ncolour to it and (as we may add) to _Columbic Acid_, another substance\r\ndiscovered by the same chemist in the following year. Columbic Acid is\r\nyellow, amorphous, nearly insoluble in cold water, but dissolving in\r\nalcohol and in alkaline solutions. It tastes somewhat less bitter than\r\ncolumbin. Bödeker surmises that it may exist in combination with the\r\nberberine.\r\n\r\nBödeker has pointed out a connection between the three bitter\r\nprinciples of calumba. If we suppose a molecule of ammonia, NH₃, to be\r\nadded to columbin C₄₂H₄₄O₁₄, the complex molecule thence resulting will\r\ncontain the elements of berberine C₂₀H₁₇NO₄, columbic acid C₂₂H₂₄O₇,\r\nand water 3H₂O.\r\n\r\nAmong the more usual constituents of plants, calumba contains (in\r\naddition to starch) pectin, gum, and nitrate of potassium, but no\r\ntannic acid. It yields when incinerated 6 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Calumba root is shipped to Europe and India from Mozambique\r\nand Zanzibar, and exported from Bombay and other Indian ports.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—It is much employed as a mild tonic, chiefly in the form of\r\ntincture or of aqueous infusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAREIRA BRAVA.\r\n\r\n_Radix Pareiræ_; _Pareira-Brava_[111]; F. _Racine de Butua ou de\r\nPareira-Brava_; G. _Grieswurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Chondodendron tomentosum_ Ruiz et Pav.

It is also found about San Sebastian further south.\r\n\r\n=History=—The Portuguese missionaries who visited Brazil in the 17th\r\ncentury became acquainted with a root known to the natives as _Abutua_\r\nor _Butua_, which was regarded as possessing great virtues. As the\r\nplant affording it was a tall climbing shrub with large, simple,\r\nlong-stalked leaves, and bore bunches of oval berries resembling\r\ngrapes, the Portuguese gave it the name of _Parreira brava_ or Wild\r\nVine.\r\n\r\nThe root was brought to Lisbon where its reputed medicinal powers\r\nattracted the notice of many persons, and among others of Michel\r\nAmelot, ambassador of Louis XIV., who took back some of it when he\r\nreturned to Paris in 1688. Specimens of the drug also reached the\r\nbotanist Tournefort, and one presented by him to Pomet was figured\r\nand described by the latter in 1694.[114] The drug was again brought\r\nto Paris by Louis-Raulin Rouillé, the successor to Amelot at Lisbon,\r\ntogether with a memoir detailing its numerous virtues.\r\n\r\nSpecimens obtained in Brazil by a naval officer named De la Mare in the\r\nearly part of the last century, were laid before the French Academy,\r\nwhich body requested a report upon them from Geoffroy, professor\r\nof medicine and pharmacy in the College of France, who was already\r\nsomewhat acquainted with the new medicine. He reported many favourable\r\ntrials in cases of inflammations of the bladder and suppression\r\nof urine.[115] The drug was a favourite remedy of Helvetius,[116]\r\nphysician to Louis XIV. and Louis XV., who administered it for years\r\nwith great success.\r\n\r\nBoth Geoffroy and Helvetius were in frequent correspondence with\r\nSloane[117] who received from the former as well as from other\r\nsources specimens of Pareira Brava, which are still in the British\r\nMuseum and have enabled us fully to identify the drug as the root of\r\n_Chondodendron tomentosum_.\r\n\r\nSeveral other plants of the order _Menispermaceæ_ have stems or roots\r\nemployed in South America in the same manner as _Chondodendron_. Pomet\r\nhad heard of two varieties of Pareira Brava, and two were known to\r\nGeoffroy.[118] Lochner of Nürnberg who published a treatise on Pareira\r\nBrava in 1719[119] brought forward a plant of Eastern Africa figured in\r\n1675 by Zanoni,[120] and supposed to be the mother plant of the drug. A\r\nspecies of _Cissampelos_ called by the Portuguese in Brazil _Caapeba_,\r\n_Cipó de Cobras_ or _Herva de Nossa Senhora_ described by Piso in\r\n1648,[121] afterwards became associated with Pareira Brava on account\r\nof similarity of properties.\r\n\r\n[114] _Hist. des Drog._ Paris, 1694. part i. livre 2. cap. 14.\r\n\r\n[115] _Hist. de l’Acad. roy. des Sciences_, anneé 1710. 56.\r\n\r\n[116] _Traité des maladies les plus fréquentes et des remèdes\r\nspécifiques pour les guérir_, Paris, 1703. 98.\r\n\r\n[117] In the volumes of Sloane MSS.

This plant is very distinct from that\r\nyielding true Pareira Brava, and though its roots and stems are used\r\nmedicinally in the West Indies,[123] there is nothing to prove that\r\nthey were ever an object of export to Europe.\r\n\r\nAs Pareira Brava failed to realise the extravagant pretensions claimed\r\nfor it, it gradually fell out of use,[124] and the characters of the\r\ntrue drug became forgotten. This at least seems to be the explanation\r\nof the fact that for many years past the Pareira Brava found in the\r\nshops and supposed to be genuine is a substance very diverse from the\r\noriginal drug,—albeit not devoid of medicinal properties. More recently\r\neven this has become scarce, and an inert Pareira Brava has been almost\r\nthe sole kind obtainable. The true drug has however still at times\r\nappeared in the European market, and attention having been directed to\r\nit,[125] we may hope that it will arrive in a regular manner.\r\n\r\nThe re-introduction of Pareira Brava into medical practice is due (so\r\nfar as Great Britain is concerned) to Brodie[126] who recommended it in\r\n1828 for inflammation of the bladder.\r\n\r\n=Description=—True Pareira Brava as derived from _Chondodendron\r\ntomentosum_ is a long, branching, woody root, attaining 2 inches or\r\nmore in diameter, but usually met with much smaller and dividing into\r\nrootlets no thicker than a quill or even than a horse-hair. It is\r\nremarkably tortuous or serpentine and marked with transverse ridges as\r\nwell as with constrictions and cracks more or less conspicuous; besides\r\nwhich the surface is strongly wrinkled longitudinally. The bark is of\r\na dark blackish brown or even quite black when free from earth, and\r\ndisposed to exfoliate. The root breaks with a coarse fibrous fracture;\r\nthe inner substance is of a light yellowish-brown,—sometimes of a dull\r\ngreenish brown.\r\n\r\nRoots of about an inch in diameter cut transversely exhibit a central\r\ncolumn 0·2 to 0·4 of an inch in diameter composed of 10 to 20\r\nconverging wedges of large-pored woody tissue with 3 or 4 zones divided\r\nfrom each other by a wavy light-coloured line. Crossing these zones\r\nare wedge-shaped woody rays, often rather sparsely and irregularly\r\ndistributed. The interradial substance has a close, resinous, waxy\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n[122] _Species Plantarum_, Holmiæ, 1753; see also _Mat. Med._ 1749. No.\r\n459.\r\n\r\n[123] Lunan, _Hort. Jamaic._ ii.

Gazette_, Feb. 16, 1828; Brodie, _Lectures on\r\nDiseases of the Urinary Organs_, ed. 3. 1842. 108, 138.\r\n\r\nThe root though hard is easily shaved with a knife, some pieces giving\r\nthe impression when cut of a waxy, rather than of a woody and fibrous\r\nsubstance. The taste is bitter, well marked but not persistent. The\r\ndrug has no particular odour. Its aqueous decoction is turned inky\r\nbluish-black by tincture of iodine.\r\n\r\nThe aerial stems especially differ by enclosing a small but\r\nwell-defined pith.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The most interesting character consists in the\r\narrangement rather than in the peculiarity of the tissues composing\r\nthis drug. The wavy light-coloured lines already mentioned are built up\r\npartly of sclerenchymatous cells. The other portions of the parenchyme\r\nare loaded with large starch granules, which are much less abundant in\r\nthe stem.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—From the examination of this drug made by one\r\nof us in 1869,[127] it was shown that the bitter principle is the same\r\nas that discovered in 1839 by Wiggers in the drug hereafter described\r\nas _Common False Pareira Brava_, and named by him _Pelosine_. It was\r\nfurther pointed out that this body possesses the chemical properties\r\nof the _Bibirine_ of Greenheart bark and of the _Buxine_ obtained by\r\nWalz from the bark of _Buxus sempervirens_ L. It was also obtained\r\non the same occasion (1869) from the stems and roots of _Cissampelos\r\nPareira_ L. collected in Jamaica; but from both drugs in the very small\r\nproportion of about ½ per cent.\r\n\r\nWhether to _Buxine_ (for by this name rather than _Pelosine_ it should\r\nbe designated) is due the medicinal power of the drug may well be\r\ndoubted. No further chemical examination of true Pareira Brava has been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The medicine is prescribed in chronic catarrhal affections of\r\nthe bladder and in calculus. From its extensive use in Brazil[128] it\r\nseems deserving of trial in other complaints. Helvetius used to give it\r\nin substance, which in 5-grain doses was taken in infusion made with\r\nboiling water from the powdered root and not strained.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—We have already pointed out how the name _Pareira Brava_\r\nhas been applied to several other drugs than that described in the\r\nforegoing pages. We shall now briefly notice the more important.\r\n\r\n1. _Stems and roots of Cissampelos Pareira_ L.—Owing to the difficulty\r\nof obtaining good Pareira Brava in the London market, although this\r\nplant is very widely diffused over all the tropical regions of both\r\nhemispheres, the firm of which one of us was formerly a member\r\n(Messrs. Allen and Hanburys, Plough Court, Lombard Street) caused to\r\nbe collected in Jamaica, under the superintendence of Mr. N. Wilson,\r\nof the Bath Botanical Gardens, the stems and root of _Cissampelos\r\nPareira_ L., of which it imported in 1866-67-68 about 300 lb. It was\r\nfound impracticable to obtain the root _per se_; and the greater bulk\r\nof the drug consisted of long cylindrical stems,[129] many of which\r\nhad been decumbent and had thrown out rootlets at the joints. They had\r\nvery much the aspect of the climbing stems of _Clematis vitalba_ L.,\r\nand varied from the thickness of a quill to that of the forefinger,\r\nseldom attaining the diameter of an inch. The stems have a light brown\r\nbark marked longitudinally with shallow furrows and wrinkles, which\r\nsometimes take a spiral direction. Knots one to three feet apart,\r\nsometimes throwing out a branch, also occur. The root is rather darker\r\nin colour, but not very different in structure from the stem.\r\n\r\n[127] _Neues Jahrb. f. Pharm._ xxxi. (1869) 257; _Pharm. Journ._ xi.\r\n(1870) 192.\r\n\r\n[128] “Presentamente (Abutua) é reputada diaphoretica, diuretica e\r\nemenagoga, e usada interiormente na dóse de duas a quatro oitavas\r\npara uma libra de infusão ou cozimento, nas febres intermittentes,\r\nhydropisias, e suspensão de lochios.”—Langgaard, _Diccionario de\r\nMedicina domestica e popular_, Rio de Janeiro, i. (1865) 17.\r\n\r\n[129] Figured, together with the plant, in Bentley and Trimen, _Medic.\r\nPlants_, part 9 (1876).\r\n\r\nThe fracture of the stem is coarse and fibrous. The transverse section,\r\nwhether of stem or root, shows a thickish, corky bark surrounding a\r\nlight brown wood composed of a number of converging wedges (10 to 20)\r\nof very porous structure, separated by narrow medullary rays. There\r\nare _no concentric layers_ of wood,[130] nor is the arrangement of\r\nthe wedges oblique as in many other stems of the order. The drug is\r\ninodorous, but has a very bitter taste without sweetness or astringency.\r\n\r\n[130] It is therefore entirely different to the wood figured as that of\r\n_C. Pareira_ by Eichler in Martius’ _Flor. Bras._ xiii. pars. i. tab.\r\n50. fig. 7.\r\n\r\n2. _Common False Pareira Brava_—Under this name we designate the drug\r\nwhich for many years past has been the ordinary Pareira Brava of the\r\nshops, and regarded until lately as derived from _Cissampelos Pareira_\r\nL. We have long endeavoured to ascertain, through correspondents in\r\nBrazil, from what plant it is derived, but without success. We only\r\nknow that it belongs to the order _Menispermaceæ_.\r\n\r\nThe drug consists of a ponderous, woody, tortuous stem and root,\r\noccurring in pieces from a few inches to a foot or more in length,\r\nand from 1 to 4 inches in thickness, coated with a thin, hard, dark\r\nbrown bark. The pieces are cylindrical, four-sided, or more or less\r\nflattened—sometimes even to the extent of becoming ribbon-like. In\r\ntransverse section, their structure appears very remarkable. Supposing\r\nthe piece to be _stem_, a well-defined pith will be found to occupy\r\nthe centre of the first-formed wood, which is a column about ¼ of an\r\ninch in diameter. This is succeeded by 10 to 15 or more concentric or\r\noftener eccentric zones, ⅒ to ²/₁₀ of an inch wide, each separated from\r\nits neighbour by a layer of parenchyme, the outermost being coated with\r\na true bark. In pieces of _true root_, the pith is reduced to a mere\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nSometimes the development of the zones has been so irregular that they\r\nhave formed themselves entirely on one side of the primitive column,\r\nthe other being coated with bark. The zones, including the layer,\r\naround the pith (if pith is present), are crossed by numerous small\r\nmedullary rays. These do not run from the centre to the circumference,\r\nbut traverse only their respective zones, on the outside of which they\r\nare arched together.\r\n\r\nThe drug, when of good quality, has its wood firm, compact, and of a\r\ndusky yellowish-brown hue, and a well-marked bitter taste. It exhibits\r\nunder the knife nothing of the close waxy texture seen in the root of\r\n_Chondodendron_, but cuts as a tough, fibrous wood. Its decoction is\r\nnot tinged blue by iodine. It was in this drug that Wiggers in 1839\r\ndiscovered _pelosine_.\r\n\r\nThe drug just described, which is by no means devoid of medicinal\r\npower, has of late years been almost entirely supplanted in the market\r\nby another sort consisting exclusively of stems which are devoid of\r\nbitterness and appear to be wholly inert. They are in the form of\r\nsticks or truncheons, mostly cylindrical. Cut traversely, they display\r\nthe same structure as the sort last described, with a well-defined\r\npith. The wood is light in weight, of a dull tint, and disposed to\r\nsplit. The bark, which consists of two layers, is easily detached.\r\n\r\n3. _Stems of Chondodendron tomentosum_ R. et P.—These have been\r\nrecently imported from Brazil, and sold as _Pareira Brava_.[131] The\r\ndrug consists of truncheons about 1½ feet in length, of a rather rough\r\nand knotty stem, from 1 to 4 inches thick.[132] The larger pieces,\r\nwhich are sometimes hollow with age, display, when cut traversely, a\r\nsmall number (5-9) nearly concentric woody zones. The youngest pieces\r\nhave the bark dotted over with small dark warts.\r\n\r\nThe wood is inodorous, but has a bitterish taste like the root, of\r\nwhich it is probably an efficient representative. Some pieces have\r\nportions of root springing from them, and detached roots occur here\r\nand there among the bits of stem. The structure and development of the\r\nlatter has been elaborately examined and figured by Moss,[133] and also\r\nby Lanessan,[134] in the French translation of our book.\r\n\r\n4. _White Pareira Brava_—Stems and roots of _Abuta rufescens_\r\nAublet.—Mr. J. Correa de Méllo of Campinas has been good enough to\r\nsend to one of us (H.) a specimen of the root and leaves[135] of this\r\nplant, marked _Parreira Brava grande_. The former we have identified\r\nwith a drug received from Rio de Janeiro as _Abutua Unha de Vaca_, i.e.\r\n_Cowhoof Abutua_, and also with a similar drug found in the London\r\nmarket. Aublet[136] states that the root of _Abuta rufescens_ was, in\r\nthe time of his visit to French Guiana, shipped from that colony to\r\nEurope as _Pareira Brava Blanc_ (White Pareira Brava).\r\n\r\n[131] 45 packages containing about 20 cwt. were offered for sale by\r\nMessrs. Lewis and Peat, drug-brokers, 11 Sept. 1873, but there had been\r\nearlier importations.\r\n\r\n[132] From these knots, which are at regular intervals, and sometimes\r\nvery protuberant, it would appear that the panicles of flower arise\r\nyear after year.\r\n\r\n[133] _Pharm. Journ._ vi. (1876) 702.\r\n\r\n[134] _Histoire des Drogues d’origine végétale_, i. (Paris, 1878) 72.\r\n\r\n[135] I have compared these leaves with Aublet’s own specimen in the\r\nBritish Museum.—D. H.\r\n\r\n[136] _Hist. des Plantes de la Guiane Françoise_, i. (1775) 618. tab.\r\n250.\r\n\r\nThis name is well applicable to the drug before us, which consists of\r\nshort pieces of a root, ½ an inch to 3 inches thick, covered with a\r\nrough blackish bark, and also of bits of stem having a pale, striated,\r\ncorky bark. Cut transversely, the root displays a series of concentric\r\nzones of white amylaceous cellular tissue, each beautifully marked with\r\nnarrow wedge-shaped medullary rays of dark, porous tissue. The wood of\r\nthe stem is harder than that of the root, the medullary rays are closer\r\ntogether and broader, and there is a distinct pith.\r\n\r\nThe wood, neither of root nor stem, has any taste or smell. A decoction\r\nof the root is turned bright blue by iodine.\r\n\r\n5. _Yellow Pareira Brava_—This drug, of which a quantity was in the\r\nhands of a London drug-broker in 1873, is, we presume, the _Pareira\r\nBrava jaune_ of Aublet—the bitter tasting stem of his “_Abuta amara_\r\nfolio levi cordiformi ligno flavescente,”—a plant of Guiana unknown to\r\nrecent botanists. That which we have seen consists of portions of a\r\nhard woody stem, from 1 to 5 or 6 inches in diameter, covered with a\r\nwhitish bark. Internally it is marked by numerous regular concentric\r\nzones, is of a bright yellow colour and of a bitter taste. It contains\r\nberberine. The same drug, apparently, was exhibited in the Paris\r\nexposition of 1878 as “Liane amère” from French Guiana.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCCULUS INDICUS.\r\n\r\n_Fructus Cocculi_; _Cocculus Indicus_; F. _Coque du Levant_; G.\r\n_Kokkelskörner_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Anamirta paniculata_ Colebrooke, 1822 (_Menispermum\r\nCocculus_ L.; _Anamirta Cocculus_ Wight et Arnott, 1834), a strong\r\nclimbing shrub found in the eastern parts of the Indian peninsula from\r\nConcan and Orissa to Malabar and Ceylon, in Eastern Bengal, Khasia and\r\nAssam, and in the Malayan Islands.\r\n\r\n=History=—It is commonly asserted that _Cocculus Indicus_ was\r\nintroduced into Europe through the Arabs, but the fact is difficult of\r\nproof; for though Avicenna[137] and other early writers mention a drug\r\nhaving the power of poisoning fish, they describe it as a _bark_, and\r\nmake no allusion to it as a production of India. Even Ibn Baytar[138]\r\nin the 13th century professed his inability to discover what substance\r\nthe older Arabian authors had in view.\r\n\r\nCocculus Indicus is not named by the writers of the School of Salerno.\r\nThe first mention of it we have met with is by Ruellius,[139] who,\r\nalluding to the property possessed by the roots of _Aristolochia_ and\r\n_Cyclamen_ of attracting fishes, states that the same power exists\r\nin the little berries found in the shops under the name of _Cocci\r\nOrientis_, which when scattered on water stupify the fishes, so that\r\nthey may be captured by the hand.\r\n\r\nValerius Cordus[140] thought the drug which he calls _Cuculi de\r\nLevante_ to be the fruit of a _Solanum_ growing in Egypt.\r\n\r\nDalechamps[141] repeated this statement in 1586, at which period\r\nand for long afterwards, Cocculus Indicus used to reach Europe from\r\nAlexandria and other parts of the Levant. Gerarde,[142] who gives\r\na very good figure of it, says it is well known in England (1597)\r\nas _Cocculus Indicus_, otherwise _Cocci_ vel _Cocculæ Orientales_,\r\nand that it is used for destroying vermin and poisoning fish. In\r\n1635 it was subject to an import duty of 2_s._ per lb., as _Cocculus\r\nIndiæ_.[143]\r\n\r\nThe use of Cocculus Indicus in medicine was advocated by Battista\r\nCodronchi, a celebrated Italian physician of the 16th century, in a\r\ntractate entitled _De Baccis Orientalibus_.[144] In the “Pinax” Caspar\r\nBauhin (about 1660) states that _Cocculæ officinarum_ “saepe racematim\r\npediculis hærentes, hederæ corymborum modo, ex Alexandria adferuntur.”\r\n\r\n[137] Valgrisi edition, 1564. lib. ii. tract. 2. cap. 488.\r\n\r\n[138] Sontheimer’s transl. ii. 460.\r\n\r\n[139] _De Natura Stirpium_, Paris, 1536. lib. iii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[140] _Adnotationes_, 1549. cap. 63 (p. 509).\r\n\r\n[141] _Hist.

The latter, as it grows, becomes raised\r\ninto a stalk about ½ an inch long, articulated at the summit with\r\nshorter stalks, each supporting a drupe, which is a matured ovary. The\r\npurple drupes thus produced are 1 to 3 in number, of gibbous ovoid\r\nform, with the persistent stigma on the straight side, and in a line\r\nwith the shorter stalk or carpodium. They grow in a pendulous panicle,\r\na foot or more in length.\r\n\r\nThese fruits removed from their stalks and dried have the aspect of\r\nlittle round berries, and constitute the Cocculus Indicus of commerce.\r\nAs met with in the market they are shortly ovoid or subreniform,\r\n⁴/₁₀ to ⁵/₁₀ of an inch long, with a blackish, wrinkled surface, and\r\nan obscure ridge running round the back. The shorter stalk, when\r\npresent, supports the fruit very obliquely. The pericarp, consisting\r\nof a wrinkled skin covering a thin woody endocarp, encloses a single\r\nreniform seed, into which the endocarp deeply intrudes. In transverse\r\nsection the seed has a horseshoe form; it consists chiefly of albumen,\r\nenclosing a pair of large, diverging lanceolate cotyledons, with a\r\nshort terete radicle.[147]\r\n\r\nThe seed is bitter and oily, the pericarp tasteless. The drug is\r\npreferred when of dark colour, free from stalks, and fresh, with the\r\nseeds well-preserved.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The woody endocarp is built up of a peculiar\r\nsclerenchymatous tissue, consisting of branched, somewhat elongated\r\ncells. They are densely packed, and run in various directions,\r\nshowing but small cavities. The parenchyme of the seed is loaded with\r\ncrystallized fatty matter.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—_Picrotoxin_, a crystallizable substance\r\noccurring in the seed to the extent of ⅖ to 1 per cent., was observed\r\nby Boullay, as early as 1812, and is the source of the poisonous\r\nproperty of the drug. Picrotoxin does not neutralize acids. It\r\ndissolves in water and in alkalis; the solution in the latter reduces\r\ncupric or bismutic oxide like the sugars, but to a much smaller extent\r\nthan glucose. The alcoholic solutions deviate the ray of polarized\r\nlight to the left. The aqueous solution of picrotoxin is not altered\r\nby any metallic salt, or by tannin, iodic acid, iodohydrargyrate or\r\nbichromate of potassium—in fact by none of the reagents which affect\r\nthe alkaloids. It may thus be easily distinguished from the bitter\r\npoisonous alkaloids, although in its behaviour with concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid and bichromate of potassium it somewhat resembles\r\nstrychnine, as shown in 1867 by Köhler.\r\n\r\n[145] Frutto d’alcuni alberi, e d’alcune piante, o erbe salvatiche,\r\ncome cipresso, ginepro, alloro, pugnitopo, e lentischio, e simili.—Lat.\r\n_bacca_; Gr. ἀκρόδρνα.—_Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca._\r\n\r\n[146] Quoted by J. J. von Tschudi, _Die Kokkelskörner und das\r\nPikrotoxin_, St. Gallen, 1847.\r\n\r\n[147] The fruit should be macerated in order to examine its structure.\r\n\r\nPicrotoxin melts at 200° C.; its composition, C₉H₁₀O₄, as ascertained\r\nin 1877 by Paternò and Oglialoro, is the same as that of everninic,\r\nhydrocoffeïc, umbellic and veratric (or dimethyl-protocatechuic\r\nacid—see Semen Sabadillæ) acids.\r\n\r\nPelletier and Couerbe (1833) obtained from the pericarp of Cocculus\r\nIndicus two crystallizable, tasteless, non-poisonous substances,\r\nhaving the same composition, and termed respectively _Menispermine_\r\nand _Paramenispermine_. These bodies, as well as the very doubtful\r\namorphous _Hypopicrotoxic Acid_ of the same chemists, require\r\nre-examination.\r\n\r\nThe fat of the seed, which amounts to about half its weight, is used in\r\nIndia for industrial purposes. Its acid constituent, formerly regarded\r\nas a peculiar substance under the name of _Stearophanic_ or _Anamirtic\r\nAcid_, was found by Heintz to be identical with stearic acid.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Cocculus Indicus is imported from Bombay and Madras, but\r\nwe have no statistics showing to what extent. The stock in the dock\r\nwarehouses of London on 1st of December, 1873, was 1168 packages,\r\nagainst 2010 packages on the same day of the previous year. The drug is\r\nmostly shipped to the Continent, the consumption in Great Britain being\r\nvery small.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—In British medicine Cocculus Indicus is only employed as an\r\ningredient of an ointment for the destruction of _pediculi_. It has\r\nbeen discarded from the _British Pharmacopœia_, but has a place in that\r\nof India.\r\n\r\n\r\nGULANCHA.\r\n\r\n_Caulis et radix Tinosporæ._\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Tinospora cordifolia_ Miers (_Cocculus cordifolius_\r\nDC.), a lofty climbing shrub found throughout tropical India from\r\nKumaon to Assam and Burma, and from Concan to Ceylon and the\r\nCarnatic.[148] It is called in Hindustani _Gulancha_; in Bombay the\r\ndrug is known under the name of _Goolwail_.\r\n\r\n=History=—The virtues of this plant which appear to have been long\r\nfamiliar to the Hindu physicians, attracted the attention of Europeans\r\nin India at the early part of the present century.[149] According to a\r\npaper published at Calcutta in 1827,[150] the parts used are the stem,\r\nleaves, and root, which are given in decoction, infusion, or a sort of\r\nextract called _pálo_, in a variety of diseases attended with slight\r\nfebrile symptoms.\r\n\r\nO’Shaughnessy declares the plant to be one of the most valuable in\r\nIndia, and that it has proved a very useful tonic. Similar favourable\r\ntestimony is borne by Waring. Gulancha was admitted to the _Bengal\r\nPharmacopœia_ of 1844, and to the _Pharmacopœia of India_ of 1868.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The stems are perennial, twining and succulent, running\r\nover the highest trees and throwing out roots many yards in length\r\nwhich descend like slender cords to the earth. They have a thick corky\r\nbark marked with little prominent tubercles.\r\n\r\n[148] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med. Plants_, part 13.\r\n\r\n[149] Fleming, _Catal. of Indian Med.

Many of the pieces are\r\nmarked with warty prominences and the scars of adventitious roots. The\r\nouter layer which is easily detached covers a shrunken parenchyme.\r\nThe transverse section of the stem shows it to be divided by about\r\n12 to 14 medullary rays into the same number of wedge-shaped woody\r\nbundles having very large vessels, but no concentric structure. The\r\ndrug is inodorous but has a very bitter taste. The root is stated by\r\nO’Shaughnessy[151] to be large, soft, and spongy.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The suberous coat consists of alternating\r\nlayers of flat corky cells and sclerenchyme, sometimes of a yellow\r\ncolour. The structure of the central part reminds one of that of\r\n_Cissampelos Pareira_ (p. 28), like which it is not divided into\r\nconcentric zones. The woody rays which are sometimes intersected by\r\nparenchyme, are surrounded by a loose circle of arched bundles of liber\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—No analysis worthy of the name has been made of\r\nthis drug, and the nature of its bitter principle is wholly unknown.\r\nWe have had no material at our disposal sufficient for chemical\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Gulancha is reputed to be tonic, antiperiodic and diuretic.\r\nAccording to Waring[152] it is useful in mild forms of intermittent\r\nfever, in debility after fevers and other exhausting diseases, in\r\nsecondary syphilitic affections and chronic rheumatism.\r\n\r\n=Substitute=—_Tinospora crispa_ Miers, an allied species occurring in\r\nSilhet, Pegu, Java, Sumatra, and the Philippines, possesses similar\r\nproperties, and is highly esteemed in the Indian Archipelago as a\r\nfebrifuge.\r\n\r\n[151] _Bengal Dispensatory_, 1842. 198.\r\n\r\n[152] _Pharm. of India_, 1868. 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBERBERIDEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTEX BERBERIDIS INDICUS.\r\n\r\n_Indian Barberry Bark._\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—This drug is allowed in the _Pharmacopœia of India_\r\nto be taken indifferently from three Indian species of _Berberis_[153]\r\nwhich are the following:—\r\n\r\n1. _Berberis aristata_ DC., a variable species occurring in the\r\ntemperate regions of the Himalaya at 6000 to 10,000 feet elevation,\r\nalso found in the Nilgiri mountains and Ceylon.[154]\r\n\r\n2. _B. Lycium_, Royle, an erect, rigid shrub found in dry, hot\r\nsituations of the western part of the Himalaya range at 3000 to 9000\r\nfeet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\n[153] For remarks on the Indian species of _Berberis_, see Hooker\r\nand Thomson’s _Flora Indica_ (1855), also Hooker’s _Flora of British\r\nIndia_, i. (1872) 108.\r\n\r\n[154] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med. Plants_, part 25.\r\n\r\n3. _B. asiatica_ Roxb.—This species has a wider distribution than the\r\nlast, being found in the dry valleys of Bhutan and Nepal whence it\r\nstretches westward along the Himalaya to Garhwal, and occurs again in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\n\r\n=History=—The medical practitioners of ancient Greece and Italy made\r\nuse of a substance called _Lycium_, (λύκιον) of which the best kind\r\nwas brought from India. It was regarded as a remedy of great value in\r\nrestraining inflammatory and other discharges; but of all the uses to\r\nwhich it was applied the most important was the treatment of various\r\nforms of ophthalmic inflammation.\r\n\r\nLycium is mentioned by Dioscorides, Pliny, Celsus, Galen, and\r\nScribonius Largus; by such later Greek writers as Paulus Ægineta,\r\nÆtius, and Oribasius, as well as by the Arabian physicians.\r\n\r\nThe author of the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea who probably lived in\r\nthe 1st century, enumerates λύκιον as one of the exports of Barbarike\r\nat the mouth of the Indus, and also names it along with Bdellium and\r\nCostus among the commodities brought to Barygaza:—and further, lycium\r\nis mentioned among the Indian drugs on which duty was levied at the\r\nRoman custom-house of Alexandria about A.D. 176-180.[155]\r\n\r\nAn interesting proof of the esteem in which it was held is afforded\r\nby some singular little vases or jars of which a few specimens are\r\npreserved in collections of Greek antiquities.[156] These vases were\r\nmade to contain lycium, and in them it was probably sold; for an\r\ninscription on the vessel not only gives the name of the drug but also\r\nthat of a person who, we may presume, was either the seller or the\r\ninventor of the composition. Thus we have the _Lycium_ of _Jason_, of\r\n_Musæus_, and of _Heracleus_. The vases bearing the name of Jason were\r\nfound at Tarentum, and there is reason to believe that that marked\r\n_Heracleus_ was from the same locality. Whether it was so or not, we\r\nknow that a certain Heraclides of Tarentum is mentioned by Celsus[157]\r\non account of his method of treating certain diseases of the eye; and\r\nthat Galen gives formulæ for ophthalmic medicines[158] on the authority\r\nof the same person.\r\n\r\nInnumerable conjectures were put forth during at least three centuries\r\nas to the origin and nature of lycium, and especially of that highly\r\nesteemed kind that was brought from India.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1833, Royle[159] communicated to the Linnean Society of\r\nLondon a paper proving that the Indian Lycium of the ancients was\r\nidentical with an extract prepared from the wood or root of several\r\nspecies of _Berberis_ growing in Northern India, and that this extract,\r\nwell known in the bazaars as _Rusot_ or _Rasot_, was in common use\r\namong the natives in various forms of eye disease.[160] This substance\r\nattracted considerable notice in India, and though its efficacy _per\r\nse_[161] seemed questionable, it was administered with benefit as a\r\ntonic and febrifuge.[162] But the _rusot_ of the natives being often\r\nbadly prepared or adulterated, the bark of the root has of late been\r\nused in its place, and in consequence of its acknowledged efficacy has\r\nbeen admitted to the _Pharmacopœia of India_.\r\n\r\n[155] Vincent, _Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients in the Indian\r\nOcean_, ii.

(1837) 83.\r\n\r\n[160] It is interesting to find that two of the names for _lycium_\r\ngiven by Ibn Baytar in the 13th century are precisely those under which\r\n_rusot_ is met with in the Indian bazaars at the present day.\r\n\r\n[161] The natives apply it in combination with alum and opium.\r\n\r\n[162] O’Shaughnessy, _Bengal Dispensatory_ (1842) 203-205.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—In _B. asiatica_ (the only species we have examined) the\r\nroots which are thick and woody, and internally of a bright yellow, are\r\ncovered with a thin, brittle bark. The bark has a light-brown corky\r\nlayer, beneath which it appears of a darker and greenish yellow hue,\r\nand composed of coarse fibres running longitudinally. The inner surface\r\nhas a glistening appearance by reason of fine longitudinal striæ. The\r\nbark is inodorous and very bitter.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition.=—Solly[163] pointed out in 1843 that the\r\nroot-bark of the Ceylon barberry [_B. aristata_] contains the same\r\nyellow colouring matter as the barberry of Europe. L. W. Stewart[164]\r\nextracted _Berberine_ in abundance from the barberry of theNilgiri\r\nHills and Northern India, and presented specimens of it to one of us in\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nThe root-bark of _Berberis vulgaris_ L. was found by Polex (1836) to\r\ncontain another alkaloid named _Oxyacanthine_, which forms with acids\r\ncolourless crystallizable salts of bitter taste.[165]\r\n\r\n=Uses.=—The root-bark of the Indian barberries administered as a\r\ntincture has been found extremely useful in India in the treatment of\r\nfevers of all types. It has also been given with advantage in diarrhœa\r\nand dyspepsia, and as a tonic for general debility. In the collection\r\nof the Chinese customs at Paris, in 1878, the root-barks of _Berberis\r\nLycium_ and _B. chinensis_, from the province of Shensi, were likewise\r\nexhibited (No. 1,823) as a tonic.\r\n\r\n[163] _Journ. of R.

The leaves\r\npartake of the active properties of the root.\r\n\r\n=History=—The virtues of the rhizome as an anthelminthic and emetic\r\nhave been long known to the Indians of North America. The plant was\r\nfigured in 1731 by Catesby[166] who remarks that its root is an\r\nexcellent emetic. Its cathartic properties were noticed by Schöpf[167]\r\nand Barton[168] and have been commented upon by many subsequent\r\nwriters. In 1820, podophyllum was introduced into the _United States\r\nPharmacopœia_, and in 1864 into the _British Pharmacopœia_. Hodgson\r\npublished in 1832 in the _Journal of the Philadelphia College of\r\nPharmacy_[169] the first attempt of a chemical examination of the\r\nrhizome, which now furnishes one of the most popular purgatives, the\r\nso-called _Podophyllin_, manufactured on a large scale at Cincinnati\r\nand in other places in America, as well as in England.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The drug consists of the rhizome and rootlets. The\r\nformer creeps to a length of several feet, but as imported is mostly\r\nin somewhat flattened pieces of 1 to 8 inches in length and 2 to 4\r\nlines in longest diameter: it is marked by knotty joints showing a\r\ndepressed scar at intervals of a few inches which marks the place of a\r\nfallen stem. Each joint is in fact the growth of one year, the terminal\r\nbud being enclosed in papery brownish sheaths. Sometimes the knots\r\nproduce one, two, or even three lateral buds and the rhizome is bi-\r\nor tri-furcate. The reddish-brown or grey surface is obscurely marked\r\nat intervals by oblique wrinkles indicating the former attachment of\r\nrudimentary leaves. The rootlets are about ½ a line thick and arise\r\nfrom below the knots and adjacent parts of the rhizome, the internodal\r\nspace being bare. They are brittle, easily detached, and commonly of a\r\npaler colour. The rhizome is mostly smooth, but some of the branched\r\npieces are deeply furrowed. Both rootstock and rootlets have a short,\r\nsmooth, mealy fracture; the transverse section is white, exhibiting\r\nonly an extremely small corky layer and a thin simple circle of about\r\n20 to 40 yellow, vascular bundles, enclosing a central pith which in\r\nthe larger pieces is often 2 lines in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe drug has a heavy narcotic, disagreeable odour, and a bitter, acrid,\r\nnauseous taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The vascular bundles are composed of spiral and\r\nscalariform vessels intermixed with cambial tissue. From each bundle a\r\nnarrow-tissued, wedge-or crescent-shaped liber-bundle projects a little\r\ninto the cortical layer. This, as well as the pith, exhibits large\r\nthin-walled cells. The rootlets are as usual of a different structure,\r\ntheir central part consisting of one group of vascular bundles more or\r\nless scattered.[170] The parenchymatous cells of the drug are loaded\r\nwith starch granules; some also contain stellate tufts of oxalate of\r\ncalcium.\r\n\r\n[166] _Nat.

Assoc._, 1877. 420-433.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The active principles of podophyllum exist in\r\nthe resin, which according to Squibb[171] is best prepared by the\r\nprocess termed _re-percolation_. The powdered drug is exhausted by\r\nalcohol which is made to percolate through successive portions. The\r\nstrong tincture thus obtained is slowly poured into a large quantity\r\nof water acidulated with hydrochloric acid (one measure of acid to\r\n70 of water), and the precipitated resin dried at a temperature not\r\nexceeding 32° C. The acid is used to facilitate the subsidence of the\r\npulverulent resin which according to Maisch settles down but very\r\nslowly if precipitated by cold water simply, and if thrown down by hot\r\nwater fuses into a dark brown cake. The resin redissolved in alcohol\r\nand again precipitated by acidulated water, after thorough washing with\r\ndistilled water and finally drying over sulphuric acid, amounts to\r\nabout 2 per cent.\r\n\r\n[171] _American Journ. of Pharm._ xvi. (1868) 1-10.\r\n\r\nResin of podophyllum is a light, brownish-yellow powder with a tinge\r\nof green, devoid of crystalline appearance, becoming darker if exposed\r\nto a heat above 32° C., and having an acrid, bitter taste; it is very\r\nincorrectly called _Podophyllin_. The product is the same whether the\r\nrhizome or the rootlets are exclusively employed.[172] It is soluble\r\nin caustic, less freely in carbonated alkalis, even in ammonia, and is\r\nprecipitated, apparently without alteration, on addition of an acid.\r\nEther separates it into two nearly equal portions, the one soluble in\r\nthe menstruum, the other not, but both energetically purgative. From\r\nthe statements of Credner[173] it appears that if caustic lye is shaken\r\nwith the ethereal solution, about half the resin combines with the\r\npotash, while the other half remains dissolved in the ether. If an acid\r\nis added to the potassic solution a red-brown precipitate is produced\r\nwhich is no longer soluble in ether nor possessed of purgative power.\r\nAccording to Credner, the body of greatest purgative activity was\r\nprecipitated by ether from an alcoholic solution of crude podophyllin.\r\n\r\nBy exhausting the resin with boiling water, Power found that finally\r\nnot more than 20 per cent. of the resin remained undissolved. By\r\nmelting the crude resin with caustic soda, a little protocatechuic acid\r\nwas obtained.\r\n\r\nF. F. Mayer[174] of New York stated podophyllum to contain, beside\r\nthe resin already mentioned, a large proportion of _Berberine_, a\r\ncolourless alkaloid, an odoriferous principle which might be obtained\r\nby sublimation in colourless scales, and finally _Saponin_. From all\r\nthese bodies the resin as prepared by Power,[175] was ascertained by\r\nhim to be destitute; he especially proved the absence of berberine in\r\nPodophyllum.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Podophyllum is only employed for the preparation of the resin\r\n(_Resina Podophylli_) which is now much prescribed as a purgative.\r\n\r\n[172] Saunders in _Am.

It almost always occurs as an accompaniment\r\nof cereal crops, frequently disappearing when this cultivation is given\r\nup. It is plentiful in England and Ireland, but less so in Scotland;\r\nis found abundantly in Central and Southern Europe and in Asia Minor,\r\nwhence it extends as far as Abyssinia, Palestine, and the banks of the\r\nEuphrates. But it does not occur in India or in North America.\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence adduced by De Candolle[176] it would appear that the\r\nplant is strictly indigenous to Sicily, Greece, Dalmatia, and possibly\r\nthe Caucasus.\r\n\r\n=History=—_Papaver Rhœas_ was known to the ancients, though doubtless\r\nit was often confounded with _P. dubium_ L. the flowers of which are\r\nrather smaller and paler. The petals were used in pharmacy in Germany\r\nin the 15th century.[177]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The branches of the stem are upright, each terminating\r\nin a conspicuous long-stalked flower, from which as it opens the two\r\nsepals fall off. The delicate scarlet petals are four in number,\r\ntransversely elliptical and attached below the ovary by very short,\r\ndark violet claws. As they are broader than long, their edges overlap\r\nin the expanded flower. In the bud they are irregularly crumpled,\r\nbut when unfolded are smooth, lustrous, and unctuous to the touch.\r\nThey fall off very quickly, shrink up in drying, and assume a\r\nbrownish-violet tint even when dried with the utmost care. Although\r\nthey do not contain a milky juice like the green parts of the plant,\r\nthey have while fresh a strong narcotic odour and a faintly bitter\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most important constituent of the petals\r\nis the colouring matter, still but very imperfectly known. According\r\nto L. Meier (1846) it consists of two acids, neither of which could\r\nbe obtained other than in an amorphous state. The colouring matter is\r\nabundantly taken up by water or spirit of wine but not by ether. The\r\naqueous infusion is not precipitated by alum, but yields a dingy violet\r\nprecipitate with acetate of lead, and is coloured blackish-brown by\r\nferric salts or by alkalis.\r\n\r\nThe alkaloids of opium cannot be detected in the petals. Attfield in\r\nparticular has examined the latter (1873) for morphine but without\r\nobtaining a trace of that body.\r\n\r\n[176] _Géogr. botanique_, ii (1855) 649.\r\n\r\n[177] Flores Papaveris rubri—in the list of the pharmaceutical shop of\r\nthe town of Nördlingen. See Flückiger, in the _Archiv der Pharm._ 211\r\n(1877) 97, No. 62.\r\n\r\nThe milky juice of the herb and capsules has a narcotic odour, and\r\nappears to exert a distinctly sedative action. Hesse obtained from them\r\n(1865) a colourless crystallizable substance, _Rhœadine_, C₂₁H₂₁NO₆,\r\nof weak alkaline reaction. It is tasteless, not poisonous, nearly\r\ninsoluble in water, alcohol, ether, chloroform, benzol, or aqueous\r\nammonia, but dissolves in weak acids. Its solution in dilute sulphuric\r\nor hydrochloric acid acquires after a time a splendid red colour,\r\ndestroyed by an alkali but reappearing on addition of an acid. Hesse\r\nfurther believes (1877) the milky juice to contain meconic acid.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Red Poppy petals are employed in pharmacy only for the sake of\r\ntheir fine colouring matter. They should be preferred in the fresh\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPSULÆ PAPAVERIS.\r\n\r\n_Fructus Papaveris_; _Poppy Capsules_, _Poppy Heads_; F. _Capsules ou\r\nTêtes de Pavot_; G. _Mohnkapseln_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Papaver somniferum_ L. Independently of the\r\ngarden-forms of this universally known annual plant, we may, following\r\nBoissier,[178] distinguish three principal varieties, viz.:—\r\n\r\nα. _setigerum_ (_P. setigerum_ DC), occurring in the Peloponnesus,\r\nCyprus, Corsica and the islands of Hières, the truly wild form of the\r\nplant with acutely toothed leaves, the lobes sharp-pointed, and each\r\nterminating in a bristle. The leaves, peduncles, and sepals are covered\r\nwith scattered bristly hairs, and the stigmata are 7 or 8 in number.\r\n\r\nβ. _glabrum_—Capsule subglobular, stigmata 10 to 12. Chiefly cultivated\r\nin Asia Minor and Egypt.\r\n\r\nγ. _album_ (_P. officinale_ Gmelin)—has the capsule more or less\r\negg-shaped and devoid of apertures. It is cultivated in Persia.\r\n\r\nBesides the differences indicated above, the petals vary from white\r\nto red or violet, with usually a dark purplish spot at the base of\r\neach.[179] The seeds also vary from white to slate-coloured.\r\n\r\n=History=—The poppy has been known from a remote period throughout the\r\neastern countries of the Mediterranean, Asia Minor, and Central Asia,\r\nin all which regions its cultivation is of very ancient date.[180]\r\n\r\nSyrup of poppies, a medicine still in daily use, is recommended as a\r\nsedative in catarrh and cough in the writings of the younger Mesue\r\n(_ob._ A.D. 1015) who studied at Bagdad, and subsequently resided at\r\nCairo as physician to the Caliph of Egypt. Their medicinal use seems to\r\nhave reached Europe at an early period, for the Welsh “Physicians of\r\nMyddvai” in the 13th century already stated:[181] “Poppy heads bruised\r\nin wine will induce a man to sleep soundly.” They even prepared pills\r\nwith the juice of poppy, which they called _opium_. In the _Ricettario\r\nFiorentino_ (see Appendix R) a formula is given for the syrup as\r\n_Syroppo di Papaveri semplici di Mesue_; in the first pharmacopœia of\r\nthe London College (1618), the medicine is prescribed as _Syrupus de\r\nMeconio Mesuæ_.\r\n\r\n[178] _Flora Orientalis_, i. (1867) 116.\r\n\r\n[179] English growers prefer a _white-flowered_ poppy.\r\n\r\n[180] For further particulars consult Ritter, _Erdkunde von Asien_, vi.\r\n(1843) 773, etc.; Unger, _Botanische Streifzüge auf dem Gebiete der\r\nCulturgeschichte_, ii. (1857) 46.\r\n\r\n[181] _Meddygon Myddfai_, Llandovery, 1861, 50. 216. 400.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit is formed by the union of 8 to 20 carpels, the\r\nedges of which are turned inwards and project like partitions towards\r\nthe interior, yet without reaching the centre, so that the fruit is\r\nreally one-celled. In the unripe fruit, the sutures of the carpels are\r\ndistinctly visible externally as shallow longitudinal stripes.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is crowned with a circular disc, deeply cut into angular\r\nridge-like stigmas in number equal to the carpels, projecting in a\r\nstellate manner with short obtuse lobes. Each carpel opens immediately\r\nbelow the disc by a pore, out of which the seeds may be shaken; but\r\nin some varieties of poppy the carpel presents no aperture even when\r\nfully ripe. The fruit is globular, sometimes flattened below, or it is\r\novoid; it is contracted beneath into a sort of neck immediately above\r\na tumid ring at its point of attachment with the stalk. Grown in rich\r\nmoist ground in England, it often attains a diameter of three inches,\r\nwhich is twice that of the capsules of the opium poppy of Asia Minor or\r\nIndia. While growing it is of a pale glaucous green, but at maturity\r\nbecomes yellowish-brown, often marked with black spots. The outer wall\r\nof the pericarp is smooth and hard; the rest is of a loose texture, and\r\nwhile green exudes on the slightest puncture an abundance of bitter\r\nmilky juice. The interior surface of the pericarp is rugose, and\r\nminutely and beautifully striated transversely. From its sutures spring\r\nthin and brittle placentæ directed towards the centre and bearing on\r\ntheir perpendicular faces and edges a vast number of minute reniform\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nThe unripe fruit has a narcotic odour which is destroyed by drying; and\r\nits bitter taste is but partially retained.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The outer layer consists of a thin cuticle\r\nexhibiting a large number of stomata; the epidermis is formed of a\r\nrow of small thick-walled cells. Fragments of these two layers, which\r\non the whole exhibit no striking peculiarity, are always found in the\r\nresidue of opium after it has been exhausted by water.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part of the constituent tissues of the fruit\r\nis the system of laticiferous vessels, which is of an extremely\r\ncomplicated nature inasmuch as it is composed of various kinds of cells\r\nintimately interlaced so as to form considerable bundles.[182] The\r\ncells containing the milky juice are larger but not so much branched as\r\nin many other plants.\r\n\r\n[182] For particulars see _Trécul, Ann. des Sciences Nat._ v. (1866)\r\n49; also Flückiger, _Grundlagen der Pharmaceutischen Waarenkunde_,\r\n1873. 45.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The analyses of poppy heads present discrepant\r\nresults with regard to morphine. Merck and Winckler detected it in the\r\nripe fruit to the extent of 2 per cent., and it has also been found by\r\nGroves (1854) and by Deschamps d’Avallon (1864). Other chemists have\r\nbeen unable to find it.\r\n\r\nIn recent pharmacopœias poppy heads are directed to be taken previous\r\nto complete maturity, and both Meurein and Aubergier have shown that\r\nin this state they are richer in morphine than when more advanced.\r\nDeschamps d’Avallon found them sometimes to contain narcotine. He also\r\nobtained mucilage perceptible by neutral acetate of lead, ammonium\r\nsalts, meconic, tartaric, and citric acid, the ordinary mineral\r\nacids, wax, and lastly two new crystalline bodies, _Papaverin_, and\r\n_Papaverosine_. The former is not identical with Merck’s alkaloid of\r\nthe same name; although nitrogenous and bitter, it has an acid reaction\r\n(?), yet does not combine with bases. It yields a blue precipitate with\r\na solution of iodine in iodide of potassium.\r\n\r\nPapaverosine on the other hand is a base to which sulphuric acid\r\nimparts a violet colour, changing to dark yellowish-red on addition of\r\nnitric acid.\r\n\r\nIn ripe poppy heads, Hesse (1866) found _Rhœadine_. Groves in 1854\r\nsomewhat doubtfully announced the presence of _Codeine_. Fricker[183]\r\nstated to have obtained from the capsules 0·10 per cent. of alkaloid,\r\nand Krause[184] was able to prove the presence of traces of morphine,\r\nnarcotine, and meconic acid. Ripe poppy capsules (seeds removed) dried\r\nat 100° C. afforded us 14·28 per cent. of ash, consisting chiefly\r\nof alkaline chlorides and sulphates, with but a small quantity of\r\nphosphate.\r\n\r\n=Production=—Poppies are grown for medicinal uses in many parts of\r\nEngland, mostly on a small scale. The large and fine fruits (poppy\r\nheads) are usually sold entire; the smaller and less slightly are\r\nbroken and the seeds having been removed are supplied to the druggist\r\nfor pharmaceutical preparations. The directions of the pharmacopœia as\r\nto the fruit being gathered when “nearly ripe” does not appear to be\r\nmuch regarded.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—In the form of syrup and extract, poppy heads are in common\r\nuse as a sedative. A hot decoction is often externally applied as an\r\nanodyne.\r\n\r\nIn upper India an intoxicating liquor is prepared by heating the\r\ncapsules of the poppy with jagghery and water.[185]\r\n\r\n[183] Dragendorff’s _Jahresbericht_, 1874. 148.\r\n\r\n[184] _Archiv der Pharm._ 204 (1874) 507.\r\n\r\n[185] _Catal.

No. 742.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPIUM.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Papaver somniferum_ L., see preceding article.\r\n\r\n=History=[186]—The medicinal properties of the milky juice of the poppy\r\nhave been known from a remote period. Theophrastus who lived in the\r\nbeginning of the 3rd century B.C. was acquainted with the substance\r\nin question, under the name of Μηκώνιον. The investigations of Unger\r\n(1857; see _Capsulæ Papaveris_,) have failed to trace any acquaintance\r\nof ancient Egypt with opium.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus in his _Compositiones Medicamentorum_[187] (_circa_\r\nA.D. 40) notices the method of procuring opium, and points out that the\r\ntrue drug is derived from the capsules, and not from the foliage of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n[186] For more particulars see Dr. Rice’s learned notes in _New\r\nRemedies_, New York, 1876, 229, reprinted in _Pharm. Journ._ vii. (2\r\nDec. 1876; 23 June 1877), pp. 452 and 1041.\r\n\r\n[187] Ed. Bernhold, Argent. 1786, c. iii. sect. 22.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 77 of the same century, Dioscorides[188] plainly\r\ndistinguished the juice of the capsules under the name of ὀπός from an\r\nextract of the entire plant, μηκώνειον, which he regarded as much less\r\nactive. He described exactly how the capsules should be incised, the\r\nperforming of which operation he designated by the verb ὀπίζειν. We may\r\ninfer from these statements of Dioscorides that the collection of opium\r\nwas at that early period a branch of industry in Asia Minor. The same\r\nauthority alludes to the adulteration of the drug with the milky juices\r\nof _Glaucium_ and _Lactuca_, and with gum.\r\n\r\nPliny[189] devotes some space to an account of _Opion_, of which he\r\ndescribes the medicinal use. The drug is repeatedly mentioned as\r\n_Lacrima papaveris_ by Celsus in the 1st century, and more or less\r\nparticularly by numerous later Latin authors. During the classical\r\nperiod of the Roman Empire as well as in the early middle ages, the\r\nonly sort of opium known was that of Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nThe use of the drug was transmitted by the Arabs to the nations of the\r\nEast, and in the first instance to the Persians. From the Greek word\r\nὀπός, _juice_, was formed the Arabic word _Afyun_, which has found its\r\nway into many Asiatic languages.[190]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of opium into India seems to have been connected with\r\nthe spread of Islamism, and may have been favoured by the Mahommedan\r\nprohibition of wine. The earliest mention of it as a production of that\r\ncountry occurs in the travels of Barbosa[191] who visited Calicut on\r\nthe Malabar coast in 1511. Among the more valuable drugs the prices\r\nof which he quotes, opium occupies a prominent place. It was either\r\nimported from Aden or Cambay, that from the latter place being the\r\ncheaper, yet worth three or four times as much as camphor or benzoin.\r\n\r\nPyres[192] in his letter about Indian drugs to Manuel, king of\r\nPortugal, written from Cochin in 1516, speaks of the opium of Egypt,\r\nthat of Cambay and of the kingdom of Coûs (Kus Bahár, S.W. of Bhotan)\r\nin Bengal. He adds that it is a great article of merchandize in these\r\nparts and fetches a good price;—that the kings and lords eat of it, and\r\neven the common people, though not so much because it costs dear.\r\n\r\nGarçia d’Orta[193] informs us that the opium of Cambay in the middle of\r\nthe 16th century was chiefly collected in Malwa, and that it is soft\r\nand yellowish. That from Aden and other places near the Erythrean Sea\r\nis black and hard. A superior kind was imported from Cairo, agreeing as\r\nGarçia supposed with the opium of the ancient Thebaïd, a district of\r\nUpper Egypt near the modern Karnak and Luksor.\r\n\r\n[188] Lib. iv. c. 65.\r\n\r\n[189] Lib. xx. c. 76.\r\n\r\n[190] There are no ancient Chinese or Sanskrit names for opium. In the\r\nformer language the drug is called _O-fu-yung_ from the Arabic. Two\r\nother names _Ya-pien_ and _O-pien_ are adaptations to the Chinese idiom\r\nof our word _opium_. There are several other designations which may be\r\ntranslated _Smoking dirt_, _Foreign poison_, _Black commodity_, &c.\r\n\r\n[191] _Coasts of East Africa and Malabar_ (Hakluyt Soc.), Lond. 1866.\r\n206, 223.\r\n\r\n[192] _Journ. de Soc.

Historia_, edit Clusius, Antv. 1574. lib. i. c. 4.\r\n\r\nIn India the Mogul Government uniformly sold the opium monopoly, and\r\nthe East India Company followed their example, reserving to itself the\r\nsole right of cultivating the poppy and selling the opium.\r\n\r\n_Opium thebaïcum_ was mentioned by Simon Januensis,[194] physician to\r\nPope Nicolas IV. (A.D. 1288-92), who also alludes to _meconium_ as the\r\ndried juice of the pounded capsules and leaves. Prosper Alpinus,[195]\r\nwho visited Egypt in 1580-83, states that opium or meconium was in his\r\ntime prepared in the Thebaïd from the expressed juice of poppy heads.\r\n\r\nThe German traveller Kämpfer, who visited Persia in 1685, describes\r\nthe various kinds of opium prepared in that country. The best sorts\r\nwere flavoured with nutmeg, cardamom, cinnamon and mace, or simply\r\nwith saffron and ambergris. Such compositions were called _Theriaka_,\r\nand were held in great estimation during the middle ages, and probably\r\nsupplied to a large extent the place of pure opium. It was not uncommon\r\nfor the sultans of Egypt of the 15th century to send presents of\r\n_Theriaka_ to the doges of Venice and the sovereigns of Cyprus.[196]\r\n\r\nIn Europe opium seems in later times not to have been reckoned among\r\nthe more costly drugs; in the 16th century we find it quoted at the\r\nsame price as benzoin, and much cheaper than camphor, rhubarb, or\r\nmanna.[197]\r\n\r\nWith regard to China it is supposed that opium was first brought\r\nthither by the Arabians, who are known to have traded with the southern\r\nports of the empire as early as the 9th century. More recently, at\r\nleast until the 18th century, the Chinese imported the drug in their\r\njunks as a return cargo from India. At this period it was used almost\r\nexclusively as a remedy for dysentery, and the whole quantity imported\r\nwas very small. It was not until 1767 that the importation reached\r\n1,000 chests, at which rate it continued for some years, most of the\r\ntrade being in the hands of the Portuguese. The East India Company made\r\na small adventure in 1773; and seven years later an opium depôt of two\r\nsmall vessels was established by the English in Lark’s Bay, south of\r\nMacao.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese authorities began to complain of these two ships in 1793,\r\nbut the traffic still increased, and without serious interruption until\r\n1820, when an edict was issued forbidding any vessel having opium on\r\nboard to enter the Canton river. This led to a system of contraband\r\ntrade with the connivance of the Chinese officials, which towards the\r\nexpiration of the East India Company’s charter in 1834 had assumed\r\na regular character. The political difficulties between England and\r\nChina that ensued shortly after this event, and the so-called Opium\r\nWar, culminated in the Treaty of Nanking (1842), by which five ports of\r\nChina were opened to foreign trade, and opium was in 1858 admitted as a\r\nlegal article of commerce.[198]\r\n\r\n[194] _Clavis Sanationis_, Venet. 1510. 46.\r\n\r\n[195] _De Medicina Ægyptiorum_, Lugd.

(1848); _British Almanac\r\nCompanion_ for 1844, p. 77.\r\n\r\nThe vice of opium-smoking began to prevail in China in the second half\r\nof the 17th century,[199] and in another hundred years had spread like\r\na plague over the gigantic empire. The first edict against the practice\r\nwas issued in 1796, since which there have been innumerable enactments\r\nand memorials,[200] but all powerless to arrest the evil which is still\r\nincreasing in an alarming ratio. Mr. Hughes, Commissioner of Customs at\r\nAmoy, thus wrote on this subject in his official _Trade Report_[201]\r\nfor the year 1870:—“Opium-smoking appears here as elsewhere in China\r\nto be becoming yearly a more recognized habit,—almost a necessity of\r\nthe people. Those who use the drug now do so openly, and native public\r\nopinion attaches no odium to its use, so long as it is not carried to\r\nexcess.... In the city of Amoy, and in adjacent cities and towns, the\r\nproportion of opium-smokers is estimated to be from 15 to 20 per cent.\r\nof the adult population.... In the country the proportion is stated to\r\nbe from 5 to 10 per cent....”\r\n\r\n=Production=—The poppy in whatever region it may grow always contains a\r\nmilky juice possessing the same properties; and the collection of opium\r\nis _possible_ in all temperate and subtropical countries where the\r\nrainfall is not excessive. But the production of the drug is limited by\r\nother conditions than soil and climate, among which the value of land\r\nand labour stands pre-eminent.\r\n\r\nAt the present day opium is produced on an important scale in Asia\r\nMinor, Persia, India, and China; to a small extent in Egypt. The drug\r\nhas also been collected in Europe, Algeria,[202] North America,[203]\r\nand Australia[204] but more for the sake of experiment than as an\r\nobject of commerce.\r\n\r\nWe shall describe the production of the different kinds under their\r\nseveral names.\r\n\r\n1. _Opium of Asia Minor_; _Turkey, Smyrna, or Constantinople\r\nOpium_[205]—The poppy from which this most important kind of opium\r\nis obtained is _Papaver somniferum_, var. β. _glabrum_ Boissier. The\r\nflowers are commonly purplish, but sometimes white, and the seeds vary\r\nfrom white to dark violet.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation is carried on throughout Asia Minor, both on the\r\nmore elevated and the lower lands, the cultivators being mostly\r\nsmall peasant proprietors. The plant requires a naturally rich and\r\nmoist soil, further improved by manure, not to mention much care and\r\nattention on the part of the grower. Spring frosts, drought, or locusts\r\nsometimes effect its complete destruction. The sowing takes place at\r\nintervals from November to March, partly to insure against risk of\r\ntotal failure, and partly in order that the plants may not all come to\r\nperfection at the same time.\r\n\r\n[199] Bretschneider, _Study of Chinese Bot. Works_, 1870. 48.\r\n\r\n[200] _Chinese Repository_, vol. v. (1837) vi &c.\r\n\r\n[201] Addressed to the Inspector-General of Customs, Pekin, and\r\npublished at Shanghai, 1871\r\n\r\n[202] _Pharm. Journ._ xv. (1856) 348.\r\n\r\n[203] _Am. Journ. of Phar._ xviii. (1870) 124; _Journ. of Soc. of\r\nArts_, Dec. 1, 1871.\r\n\r\n[204] _Pharm. Journ._ Oct. 1, 1870. 272.\r\n\r\n[205] Much information under this head has been derived from a paper\r\n_On the production of Opium in Asia Minor_ by S. H. Maltass (_Pharm.\r\nJourn._ xiv. 1855. 396), and one _On the Culture and Commerce in Opium\r\nin Asia Minor_, by E. R. Heffler, of Smyrna (_Pharm. Journ._ x. 1869.\r\n434).\r\n\r\nThe plants flower between May and July according to the elevation\r\nof the land. A few days after the fall of the petals the poppy head\r\nbeing about an inch and a half in diameter is ready for incision. The\r\nincision is made with a knife transversely, about half-way up the\r\ncapsule, and extends over about two-thirds the circumference, or is\r\ncarried spirally to beyond its starting point. Great nicety is required\r\nnot to cut too deep so as to penetrate the capsule, as in that case\r\nsome of the juice would flow inside and be lost. The incisions are\r\ngenerally made in the afternoon and the next morning are found covered\r\nwith exuded juice. This is scraped off with a knife, the gatherer\r\ntransferring it to a poppy leaf which he holds in his left hand. At\r\nevery alternate scraping, the knife is wetted with saliva by drawing\r\nit through the mouth, the object being to prevent the adhesion of the\r\njuice to the blade. Each poppy-head is, as a rule, cut only once; but\r\nas a plant produces several heads all of which are not of proper age at\r\nthe same time, the operation of incising and gathering has to be gone\r\nover two or three times on the same plot of ground.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a sufficient quantity of the half-dried juice has been\r\ncollected to form a cake or lump, it is wrapped in poppy leaves and put\r\nfor a short time to dry in the shade. There is no given size for cakes\r\nof opium, and they vary in weight from a few ounces to more than two\r\npounds. In some villages it is the practice to make the masses larger\r\nthan in others. Before the opium is ready for the market, a meeting of\r\nbuyers and sellers is held in each district, at which the price to be\r\nasked is discussed and settled,—the peasants being most of them in debt\r\nto the buyers or merchants.\r\n\r\nTo the latter the opium is sold in a very soft but natural state. These\r\ndealers sometimes manipulate the soft drug with a wooden pestle into\r\nlarger masses which they envelope in poppy leaves and pack in cotton\r\nbags sealed at the mouth for transport to Smyrna. According to another\r\naccount, the opium as obtained from the grower is at once packed in\r\nbags together with a quantity of the little chaffy fruits of a dock\r\n(_Rumex_ sp.) to prevent the lumps from sticking together, and so\r\nbrought in baskets to Smyrna, or ports farther north.\r\n\r\nThe opium remains in the baskets (placed in cool warehouses to avoid\r\nloss of weight) till sold, and it is only on reaching the buyer’s\r\nwarehouse that the seals are broken and the contents of the bags\r\nexposed. This is done in the presence of the buyer, seller, and\r\na public examiner, the last of whom goes through the process of\r\ninspecting the drug piece by piece, throwing aside any of suspicions\r\nquality. Heffler of Smyrna asserts that the drug is divided into three\r\nqualities, viz.—the _prime_, which is not so much a selected quality\r\nas the opium of some esteemed districts,—the _current_, which is the\r\nmercantile quality and constitutes the great bulk of the crop,—and\r\nlastly the inferior or _chiqinti_.[206] The opium of very bad quality\r\nor wholly spurious he would place in a fourth category. Maltass applies\r\nthe name _chiqinti_ (or _chicantee_) to opium of every degree of\r\nbadness.\r\n\r\nThe examination of opium by the official expert is not conducted in any\r\nscientific method. His opinion of the drug is based on colour, odour,\r\nappearance and weight, and appears to be generally very correct. Fayk\r\nBey (1867) has recommended the Turkish government to adopt the more\r\ncertain method of assaying opium by chemical means.\r\n\r\n[206] Probably signifying _refuse_,—_that which comes out_.\r\n\r\nIn Asia Minor the largest quantities of opium are now produced in the\r\nnorth-western districts of Karahissar Sahib, Balahissar, Kutaya, and\r\nKiwa (or Geiveh), the last on the river Sakariyeh which runs into the\r\nBlack Sea. These centres of large production of opium send a superior\r\nquality of the drug to Constantinople by way of Izmid; the best\r\napparently from Bogaditch and Balikesri, near the Susurlu river. Angora\r\nand Amasia are other places in the north of Asia Minor whence opium is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the peninsula Afium Karahissar (literally\r\n_opium-black-castle_) and Ushak are important localities for opium,\r\nwhich is also the case with Isbarta, Buldur and Hamid farther south.\r\nThe product of these districts finds its way to Smyrna, in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of which but little opium is produced. The\r\nexport from Smyrna in 1871, in which year the crop was very large, was\r\n5650 cases, valued at £784,500.[207]\r\n\r\n_Turkey Opium_, as it is generally called in English trade, occurs in\r\nthe form of rounded masses which according to their softness become\r\nmore or less flattened or many-sided, or irregular by mutual pressure\r\nin the cases in which they are packed. There appears to be no rule as\r\nto their weight[208] which varies from an ounce up to more than 6 lb.;\r\nfrom ½ lb. to 2 lb. is however the most usual. The exterior is covered\r\nwith the remains of poppy leaves strewn over with the _Rumex_ chaff\r\nbefore alluded to, which together make the lumps sufficiently dry to be\r\neasily handled. The consistence is such that the drug can be readily\r\ncut with a knife, or moulded between the fingers. The interior is moist\r\nand coarsely granular, varying in tint from a light chestnut to a\r\nblackish brown. Fine shreds of the epidermis of the poppy capsule are\r\nperceptible even to the naked eye, but are still more evident if the\r\nresidue of opium washed with water, is moistened with dilute chromic\r\nacid (1 to 100). The odour of Turkey opium is peculiar, and though\r\ncommonly described as narcotic and unpleasant, is to many persons far\r\nfrom disagreeable. The taste is bitter.\r\n\r\nThe substances alleged to be used for adulterating Turkey opium are\r\nsand, pounded poppy capsules, pulp of apricots or figs, gum tragacanth\r\nor even turpentine. Bits of lead are sometimes found in the lumps, also\r\nstones and masses of clay.\r\n\r\n2. _Egyptian Opium_,—though not abundant little as formerly is still\r\nmet with in European commerce. It usually occurs in hard, flattish\r\ncakes about 4 inches in diameter covered with the remnants of a\r\npoppy leaf, but not strewn over with rumex-fruits. We have also seen\r\nit (1873) as freshly imported, in a soft and plastic state. The\r\nfractured surface of this opium (when hard) is finely porous, of a dark\r\nliver-colour, shining here and there from imbedded particles of quartz\r\nor gum, and reddish-yellow points (of resin?). Under the microscope an\r\nabundance of starch granules is sometimes visible. The morphine in a\r\nsample from Merck amounted to 6 per cent.\r\n\r\n[207] Consul Cumberbatch, _Trade Report for 1871_, presented to\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n[208] The largest lump I have seen weighed 6 lb. 6 oz., being part of\r\n65 packages which I examined 2nd July, 1873.—D. H.\r\n\r\nAccording to Von Kremer who wrote in 1863,[209] there were then in\r\nUpper Egypt near Esneh, Kenneh, and Siout, as much as 10,000 _feddan_\r\n(equal to about the same number of English acres) of land cultivated\r\nwith the poppy from which opium was obtained in March, and seed\r\nin April. Hartmann[210] states that the cultivation is carried on\r\nby the government, and solely for the requirement of the sanitary\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nS. Stafford Allen in 1861 witnessed the collection of opium at Kenneh\r\nin Upper Egypt,[211] from a white-flowered poppy. An incision is made\r\nin the capsule by running a knife twice round it transversely, and the\r\njuice scraped off the following day with a sort of scoop-knife. The\r\ngatherings are collected on a leaf and placed in the sun to harden. The\r\nproduce appeared extremely small and was said to be wholly used in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nGastinel, director of the Experimental Garden at Cairo, and government\r\ninspector of pharmaceutical stores, has shown (1865) that the poppy in\r\nEgypt might yield a very good product containing 10 to 12 per cent. of\r\nmorphine, and that the present bad quality of Egyptian opium is due\r\nto an over-moist soil, and a too early scarification of the capsule,\r\nwhereby (not to mention wilful adulteration) the proportion of morphine\r\nis reduced to 3 or 4 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn 1872, 9636 lb. of opium, value £5023, were imported into the United\r\nKingdom from Egypt.\r\n\r\n3. _Persian Opium_.—Persia, probably the original home of the baneful\r\npractice of opium-eating, cultivates the drug chiefly in the central\r\nprovinces where, according to Boissier, the plant grown to furnish it\r\nis _Papaver somniferum_, var. γ _album_ (_P. officinale_ Gm.) having\r\novate roundish capsules. Poppy heads from Persia which we saw at the\r\nParis Exhibition in 1867, had vertical incisions and contained white\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nThe strongest opium called in Persia _Teriak-e-Arabistani_ is obtained\r\nin the neighbourhood of Dizful and Shuster, east of the Lower Tigris.\r\nGood opium is likewise produced about Sari and Balfarush in the\r\nprovince of Mazanderan, and in the southern province of Kerman. The\r\nlowest quality which is mixed with starch and other matters, is sold\r\nin light brown sticks; it is made at Shahabdulazim, Kashan, and\r\nKum.[212] A large quantity of opium appears to be produced in Khokan\r\nand Turkestan.\r\n\r\n[209] _Aegypten, Forschungen über Land und Volk während eines 10\r\nzehnjährigen Aufenthalts_, Leipzig, 1863.\r\n\r\n[210] _Naturgeschichtl. medicin. Skizze der Nilländer_, Berlin, 1866.\r\n353.\r\n\r\n[211] _Pharm. Journ._ iv. (1863) 199.\r\n\r\n[212] Polak, _Persien_, ii. (1865) 248, &c.\r\n\r\nPersian opium is carried overland to China through Bokhara, Khokan and\r\nKashgar;[213] but since 1864 it has also been extensively conveyed\r\nthither by sea, and it is now quoted in trade reports like that of\r\nMalwa, Patna, and Benares.[214] It is exported by way of Trebizond to\r\nConstantinople where it used to be worked up to imitate the opium of\r\nAsia Minor, and at the same time adulterated.[215] Since 1870, Persian\r\nopium which was previously rarely seen as such in Europe, has been\r\nimported in considerable quantity, being shipped now from Bushire\r\nand Bunder Abbas, in the Persian Gulf, to London or to the Straits\r\nSettlements and China. It occurs in various forms, the most typical\r\nbeing a short rounded cone weighing 6 to 10 ounces. We have also seen\r\nit in flat circular cakes, 1¼ lb. in weight. In both forms the drug\r\nwas of firm consistence, a good opium-smell, and internally brown of a\r\ncomparatively light tint. The surface was strewn over with remnants of\r\nstalks and leaves. Some of it had been collected with the use of oil\r\nas in Malwa (see p. 51), which was apparent from the greasiness of the\r\ncone, and the globules of oil visible when the drug was cut. The best\r\nsamples of this drug as recently imported, have yielded 8 to 10·75 per\r\ncent. of morphine, reckoned on the opium in its moist state.[216]\r\n\r\n[213] Powell, _Economic Products of the Punjab_, i.

Dillworth\r\nHoward, of the firm of Howard and Sons, Stratford. A morphine\r\nmanufacturer has no particular interest in ascertaining the amount\r\nof water in the opium he purchases. All he requires to know is the\r\npercentage of morphine which the drug contains. It is otherwise with\r\nthe pharmaceutist, whose preparations have to be made with _dried\r\nopium_.\r\n\r\nCarles,[217] from a specimen which seems to have been adulterated with\r\nsugar, obtained 8·40 per cent. of morphine, and 3·60 of narcotine, the\r\ndrug not having been previously dried.\r\n\r\nInferior qualities of Persian opium have also been imported. Some\r\nthat was soft black and extractiform afforded _undried_ only 3 to ½\r\nper cent. of morphine (Howard); while some of very pale hue in small\r\nsticks, each wrapped in paper, yielded no more than 0·2 per cent.!\r\n(Howard). For further details, see p. 61.\r\n\r\nIn Turkestan an aqueous extract of poppy heads collected before\r\nmaturity is prepared; it seems to be rich in alkaloids.[218]\r\n\r\n4. _European Opium_—From numerous experiments made during the present\r\ncentury in Greece, Italy, France, Switzerland, Germany, England, and\r\neven in Sweden, it has been shown that in all these countries a very\r\nrich opium, not inferior to that of the East, can be produced.\r\n\r\nThe most numerous attempts at opium-growing in Europe have been\r\nmade in France. But although the cultivation was recommended in the\r\nstrongest terms by Guibourt,[219] who found in French opium the highest\r\npercentage of morphine yet observed (22·8 per cent.), it has never\r\nbecome a serious branch of industry.\r\n\r\nAubergier of Clermont-Ferrand has carried on the cultivation with great\r\nperseverance since 1844, and has succeeded in producing a very pure\r\ninspissated juice which he calls _Affium_, and which is said to contain\r\nuniformly[220] 10 per cent. of morphine. It is made up in cakes of 50\r\ngrammes, but is scarcely an article of wholesale commerce.[221]\r\n\r\nSome careful and interesting scientific investigations relating to\r\nthe production of opium in the neighbourhood of Amiens, were made by\r\nDecharme in 1855 to 1862.[222] He found 14,725 capsules incised within\r\n6 days to afford 431 grammes of milky juice, yielding 205 grammes (=\r\n47·6 per cent.) of dry opium containing 16 per cent. of morphine.\r\nAnother sample of dried opium afforded 20 per cent. of morphine.\r\nDecharme observed that the amount of morphine diminished when the juice\r\nis very slowly dried,—a point of great importance deserving attention\r\nin India. The peculiar odour of opium as observable in the oriental\r\ndrug, is developed, according to the same authority, by a kind of\r\nfermentation.[223] Adrian even suggests that morphine is formed only by\r\na similar process, inasmuch as he could obtain none by exhausting fresh\r\npoppy capsules with acidulated alcohol, while capsules of the same crop\r\nyielded an opium rich in morphine.\r\n\r\n[217] _Journ. de Pharm._ xvii (1873) 427.\r\n\r\n[218] Fedschenko’s Catalogue of the Moscow Exhibition, Turkestan\r\ndepartment, in Buchner’s _Repertorium für Pharmacie_, xxii.

(1867) 222.\r\n\r\n5. _=East Indian Opium=_—The principal region of British India\r\ndistinguished for the production of opium is the central tract of\r\nthe Ganges, comprising an area of about 600 miles in length, by 200\r\nmiles in width. It reaches from Dinajpur in the east, to Hazaribagh in\r\nthe south, and Gorakhpur in the north, and extends westward to Agra,\r\nthus including the flat and thickly-populated districts of Behar and\r\nBenares. The amount of land here actually under poppy cultivation was\r\nestimated in 1871-72 as 560,000 acres.\r\n\r\nThe region second in importance for the culture of opium consists of\r\nthe broad table-lands of Malwa, and the slopes of the Vindhya Hills, in\r\nthe dominions of the Holkar.\r\n\r\nBeyond these vast districts, the area under poppy cultivation is\r\ncomparatively small,[224] yet it appears to be on the increase.\r\nStewart[225] reports (1869) that the plant is grown (principally for\r\nopium) throughout the plains of the Punjab, but less commonly in the\r\nnorth-west. In the valley of the Biās, east of Lahore, it is cultivated\r\nup to nearly 7500 feet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of opium in these parts of India is not under any\r\nrestriction as in Hindustan. Most districts, says Powell (1868),[226]\r\ncultivate the poppy to a certain extent, and produce a small quantity\r\nof indifferent opium for local consumption. The drug, however, is\r\nprepared in the Hill States, and the opium of Kūlū (E. of Lahore),\r\nis of excellent quality, and forms a staple article of trade in that\r\nregion. Opium is also produced in Nepal, Basāhīr and Rāmpūr, and at\r\nDoda Kashtwar in the Jammū territory.[227] It is exported from these\r\ndistricts to Yarkand, Khutan, Aksu, and other Chinese provinces,—to the\r\nextent in 1862 of 210 _maunds_ (= 16,800 lb.). The Madras Presidency\r\nexports no opium at all.\r\n\r\nThe opium districts of Bengal[228] are divided into two agencies,\r\nthose of Behar and Benares, which are under the control of officials\r\nresiding respectively at Patna and Ghazipur. The opium is a government\r\nmonopoly—that is to say, the cultivators are under an obligation to\r\nsell their produce to the government at a price agreed on beforehand;\r\nat the same time it is wholly optional with them, whether to enter on\r\nthe cultivation or not.\r\n\r\n[224] So we may infer from the fact that of the 39,225 chests which\r\npaid duty to Government at Bombay in 1872, 37,979 were Malwa opium, the\r\nremaining 1,246 being reckoned as from Guzerat.—_Statement of the Trade\r\nand Nav. of Bombay for 1871-72_, p. xv.\r\n\r\n[225] _Punjab Plants_, Lahore, 1869. 10.\r\n\r\n[226] _Op. cit._ i. 294.\r\n\r\n[227] At the base of the Himalaya, S. and S.E. of Kashmir.\r\n\r\n[228] Much of what follows respecting Bengal opium is derived from a\r\npaper by Eatwell, formerly First Assistant and Opium Examiner in the\r\nGovernment Factory at Ghazipur.—_Pharm. Journ._ xi. (1852) 269, &c.\r\n\r\nThe variety of poppy cultivated is the same as in Persia, namely, _P.\r\nsomniferum_, var. γ _album_. As in Asia Minor, a moist and fertile\r\nsoil is indispensable.[229] The plant is liable to injury by insects,\r\nexcessive rain, hail, or the growth on its roots of a species of\r\n_Orobanche_.\r\n\r\nIn Behar the sowing takes place at the beginning of November, and the\r\ncapsules are sacrificed in February or March (March or April in Malwa).\r\nThis operation is performed with a peculiar instrument, called a\r\n_nushtur_, having three or four two-pointed blades, bound together with\r\ncotton thread.[230] In using the _nushtur_, only one set of points is\r\nbrought into use at a time, the capsule being scarified vertically from\r\nbase to summit. This scarification is repeated on different sides of\r\nthe capsule at intervals of a few days, from two to six times. In many\r\ndistricts of Bengal, transverse cuts are made in the poppy-head as in\r\nAsia Minor.\r\n\r\nThe milky juice is scraped off early on the following morning with\r\nan iron scoop, which as it becomes filled is emptied into an earthen\r\npot carried by the collector’s side. In Malwa a flat scraper is used\r\nwhich, as well as the fingers of the gatherer, is wetted from time to\r\ntime with linseed oil to prevent the adhesion of the glutinous juice.\r\nAll accounts represent the juice to be in a very moist state by reason\r\nof dew, which sometimes even washes it away; but so little is this\r\nmoisture of the juice thought detrimental that, as Butter states,[231]\r\nthe collectors in some places actually wash their scrapers in water,\r\nand add the washings to the collection of the morning!\r\n\r\nThe juice when brought home is a wet granular mass of pinkish colour;\r\nand in the bottom of the vessel in which it is contained, there\r\ncollects a dark fluid resembling infusion of coffee, which is called\r\n_pasēwā_. The recent juice strongly reddens litmus, and blackens\r\nmetallic iron. It is placed in a shallow earthen vessel, which is\r\ntilted in such a manner that the _pasēwā_ may drain off as long as\r\nthere is any of it to be separated. This liquor is set aside in a\r\ncovered vessel. The residual mass is now exposed to the air, though\r\nnever to the sun, and turned over every few days to promote its\r\nattaining the proper degree of dryness, which according to the Benares\r\nregulations, allows of 30 per cent. of moisture. This drying operation\r\noccupies three or four weeks.\r\n\r\nThe drug is then taken to the Government factory for sale; previous to\r\nbeing sold it is examined for adulteration by a native expert, and its\r\nproportion of water is also carefully determined. Having been received\r\ninto stock, it undergoes but little treatment beyond a thorough mixing,\r\nuntil it is required to be formed into globular cakes. This is effected\r\nin a somewhat complicated manner, the opium being strictly of standard\r\nconsistence. First the quantity of opium is weighed out, and having\r\nbeen formed into a ball is enveloped in a crust of dried poppy petals,\r\nskilfully agglutinated one over the other by means of a liquid called\r\n_lēwā_. This consists partly of good opium, partly of _pasēwā_, and\r\npartly of opium of inferior quality, all being mixed with the washings\r\nof the various pots and vessels which have contained opium, and then\r\nevaporated to a thick fluid, 100 grains of which should afford 53 of\r\ndry residue. These various things are used to form a ball of opium in\r\nthe following proportions:—\r\n\r\n[229] It is said (1873) that the ground devoted to poppy-culture in\r\nBengal is becoming impoverished, and that the plant no longer attains\r\nits usual dimensions.\r\n\r\n[230] For figures of the instrument, see _Pharm. Journ._ xi. (1862) 207.\r\n\r\n[231] _Pharm. Journ._ xi.

Should any become distended, it is at\r\nonce opened, the gas allowed to escape, and the cake made up again.\r\nAfter three days the cakes are placed, by the end of July, in frames in\r\nthe factory where the air is allowed to circulate. They still however\r\nrequire constant watching and turning, as they are liable to contract\r\nmildew which has to be removed by rubbing in _poppy trash_. By October\r\nthe cakes have become perfectly dry externally and quite hard, and are\r\nin condition to be packed in cases (40 cakes in each) for the China\r\nmarket which consumes the great bulk of the manufacture.\r\n\r\nFor consumption in India the drug is prepared in a different shape.\r\nIt is inspissated by solar heat till it contains only 10 per cent. of\r\nmoisture, in which state it is formed into square cages of 2 lb. each\r\nwhich are wrapped in oil paper, or it is made into flat square tablets.\r\nSuch a drug is known as _Abkāri Opium_.\r\n\r\nThe Government opium factories in Bengal are conducted on the most\r\norderly system. The care bestowed in selecting the drug, and in\r\nexcluding any that is damaged or adulterated is such that the merchants\r\nwho purchase the commodity rarely require to examine it, although\r\npermission is freely accorded to open at each sale any number of chests\r\nor cakes they may desire. In the year 1871-72 the number of chests sold\r\nwas 49,695, the price being £139 per chest, which is £26 higher than\r\nthe average of the preceding year. The net profit on each chest was\r\n£90.[232]\r\n\r\nIn Malwa the manufacture of opium is left entirely to private\r\nenterprise, the profit to Government being derived from an export duty\r\nof 600 rupees (£60) per chest.[233] As may readily be supposed, the\r\ndrug is of much less uniform quality than that which has passed through\r\nthe Bengal agencies, and having no guarantee as to purity it commands\r\nless confidence.\r\n\r\n[232] _Statement exhibiting the moral and material progress and\r\ncondition of India during the year_ 1871-72,—Blue Book ordered to be\r\nprinted 29th July, 1873. p. 10.\r\n\r\n[233] The revenue by this duty upon opium exported from Bombay in the\r\nyear 1871-72, was £2,353,500.\r\n\r\nMalwa opium is not made into balls, but into rectangular masses, or\r\nbricks which are not cased in poppy petals; it contains as much as 95\r\nper cent. of dry opium. Some opium sold in London as _Malwa Opium_ in\r\n1870 had the form of rounded masses covered with vegetable remains. It\r\nwas of firm consistence, dark colour, and rather smoky odour. W. D.\r\nHoward obtained from it (_undried_) 9 per cent. of morphine. Other\r\nimportations afforded the same chemist 4·8 and 6 per cent. respectively.\r\n\r\nThe chests of Patna opium hold 120 catties or 160 lb. Those of Malwa\r\nopium 1 pecul or 133⅓ lb.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of opium produced in India cannot be ascertained, but the\r\namount exported[234] is accurately known. Thus from British India the\r\nexports in the year ending March 31, 1872, were 93,364 chests valued at\r\n£13,365,228. Of this quantity Bengal furnished 49,455 chests, Bombay\r\n43,909 chests: they were exported thus:—\r\n\r\n    To China                                    85,470 chests.\r\n      The Straits Settlements                    7,845   ”\r\n      Ceylon, Java, Mauritius and Bourbon           38   ”\r\n      The United Kingdom                             4   ”\r\n      Other countries                                7   ”\r\n                                                ------\r\n                              Total             93,364   ”\r\n                                                ------\r\n\r\nThe net revenue to the Government of India from opium in the year\r\n1871-72 was £7,657,213.\r\n\r\n6. _=Chinese Opium=_—China consumes not only nine-tenths of the opium\r\nexported from India, and a considerable quantity of that produced in\r\nAsia Minor, but the whole of what is raised in her own provinces. How\r\nlarge is this last quantity we shall endeavour to show.\r\n\r\nThe drug is mentioned as a production of Yunnan in a history of that\r\nprovince, of which the latest edition appeared in 1736. But it is only\r\nvery recently that its cultivation in China has assumed such large\r\nproportions as to threaten serious competition with that in India.[235]\r\n\r\nIn a _Report upon the Trade of Hankow_ for 1869, addressed to Mr.\r\nHart, Inspector-General of Customs, Pekin, we find _Notes of a journey\r\nthrough the opium districts of Szechuen_, undertaken for the special\r\npurpose of obtaining information about the drug.[236] From these notes\r\nit appears that the estimated crop of the province for 1869 was 4235\r\npeculs (= 564,666 lb.). This was considered _small_, and the Szechuen\r\nopium merchants asserted that 6000 peculs was a fair average. The same\r\nauthorities estimated the annual yield of the province of Kweichow\r\nat 15,000, and of Yunnan at 20,000 peculs, making a total of 41,000\r\npeculs or 5,466,666 lb. In 1869 also, Sir R. Alcock reported that about\r\ntwo-thirds of the province of Szechuen and one-third of that of Yunnan\r\nwere devoted to opium.[237]\r\n\r\nMr. Consul Markham states[238] that the province of Shensi likewise\r\nfurnishes important supplies. Mr. Edkins the well-known missionary\r\nhas lately pointed out from personal observation[238] the extensive\r\ncultivation of the poppy in the north-eastern province of Shantung.\r\n\r\n[234] _Annual Statement of the Trade and Navigation of British India\r\nwith foreign countries_, published by order of the Governor-General,\r\nCalcutta, 1872. 52.\r\n\r\n[235] In the _Report on the Trade of Hankow for 1869_ addressed to\r\nMr. Hart, Inspector-General of Customs, Pekin, it is stated—“The\r\nimportation of opium is considerably short for the last two seasons,\r\nbut this is not to be wondered at now that each opium-shopkeeper in\r\nthis and the surrounding districts advertises native drug for sale.”\r\n\r\nW. H. Medhurst, British Consul at Shanghai, says—“The drug is now being\r\nso extensively produced by the Chinese upon their own soil as sensibly\r\nto affect the demand for the India-grown commodity.”—_Foreigner in Far\r\nCathay_, Lond. 1872. 20.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of opium exported from Bombay in 1871-72 was less by 1719\r\nchests than that exported in 1870-71, the decrease being attributed to\r\nthe present large cultivation in China.—_Statement of the Trade and\r\nNav. of Bombay for 1871-72_, pp. xii. xvi.\r\n\r\n[236] According to the French missionaries, the cultivation of the\r\npoppy in the great province of Szechuen was hardly known even so\r\nrecently as 1840.\r\n\r\n[237] _Calcutta Blue Book_, p. 205.\r\n\r\n[238] _Journ. of Soc. of Arts_, Sept. (1872) 6, p. 338.\r\n\r\nOpium of very fair quality is now produced about Ninguta (lat. 44°) in\r\nnorth-eastern Manchuria, a region having a rigorous winter climate.\r\nConsul Adkins of Newchwang who visited this district in 1871, reports\r\nthat the opium is inspissated in the sun until hard enough to be\r\nwrapped in poppy leaves, and that its price on the spot is equal to\r\nabout 1s. per ounce.[239]\r\n\r\nShensi opium is said to be the best, then that of Yunnan. But Chinese\r\nconsumers mostly regard home-grown opium as inferior in strength and\r\nflavour, and only fit for use when mixed with the Indian drug.[240]\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the growing of opium in China has passed\r\nunnoticed by the Chinese Government. Whatever may be the nature of the\r\nsanction now accorded to this branch of industry, it was “rigorously”\r\nprohibited, at least in some provinces, about ten years ago, the\r\neffect of the prohibition being to stimulate the foreign importations.\r\nThus at Shanghai in 1865, the importation of Benares opium was 2637\r\npeculs,[241] being more than double that of the previous year, and\r\nPersian opium, very rarely seen before, was imported to the extent of\r\n533 peculs, besides about 70 peculs of Turkish.[242]\r\n\r\nOf the growth of the trade in opium between India and China, the\r\nfollowing figures[243] will give some idea: value of exports in\r\n\r\n    1852-53—£6,470,915.   1861-62—£9,704,972.   1871-72—£11,605,577.\r\n\r\nand[244]\r\n\r\n  In               1872        1873        1874        1875       1876\r\n  Chests opium,   93,364      82,908      88,727      94,746      88,350\r\n  Value,     £13,365,228  11,426,280  11,341,857  11,956,972  11,148,426\r\n\r\nIn 1877 the imports of opium in Hong Kong were stated to consist\r\nof 6818 peculs, valued at 2,380,665 taels, coming from Patna (2158\r\npeculs), Benares (3596 peculs), Persia (1041 peculs), Malwa (10\r\npeculs), Turkey (3⅓ peculs). In the same year 4043 peculs of opium were\r\nimported in Amoy.\r\n\r\nPoppy cultivation in the south-west of China has been briefly described\r\nby Thorel,[245] from whose remarks it would appear to be exactly like\r\nthat of India. The poppy is white-flowered; the head is wounded with a\r\nthree-bladed knife, in a series of 3 to 5 vertical incisions, and the\r\nexuded juice is scraped off and transferred to a small pot suspended at\r\nthe waist. How the drug is finished off we know not. A Chinese account\r\nstates simply that the best opium is sun-dried. But little is known of\r\nits physical and chemical properties. Thorel speaks of it as a soft\r\nsubstance resembling an extract. Dr. R. A. Jamieson[246] describes\r\na sample submitted to him as a flat cake enveloped in the sheathing\r\npetiole of bamboo; externally it was a blackish-brown, glutinous\r\nsubstance, dry and brittle on the outside. It lost by drying 18 per\r\ncent. of water, and afforded upon incineration 7·5 per cent. of ash. In\r\n100 grains of the (undried) drug, there were found 5·9 of morphine, and\r\n7·5 of narcotine.

The following remarks bear chiefly on the\r\nmicroscopic appearances of the drug.\r\n\r\nAs will be presently shown, a more or less considerable part of the\r\ndrug consists of peculiar substances which are mostly crystallizable\r\nand are many of them present in a crystalline state in the drug itself.\r\nAll kinds of opium appear more or less crystalline when a little in a\r\ndry state is triturated with benzol and examined under the microscope.\r\nThe forms are various: opium from Asia Minor exhibits needles and\r\nshort imperfect crystals usually not in large quantity, whereas\r\nIndian and still more Persian opium is not only highly crystalline\r\nbut shows a variety of forms which become beautifully evident when\r\nseen by polarized light. In several kinds large crystals occur which\r\nare doubtless sugar, either intentionally mixed or naturally present.\r\nThe crystals seen in opium are not however sufficiently developed\r\nto warrant positive conclusions as to their nature, besides which\r\nthe opium constituents when pure are capable under slightly varied\r\ncircumstances of assuming very different forms. Hence the attempt to\r\nobtain from solutions crystals which shall be comparable with those of\r\nthe same substances in a state of purity often fails. Some interesting\r\nobservations in this direction were made by Deane and Brady in\r\n1864-5.[248]\r\n\r\nAll opium has a peculiar narcotic odour and a sharp bitter taste.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Poppy-juice like analogous vegetable fluids is a\r\nmixture of several substances in variable proportion. With the commoner\r\nsubstances which constitute the great bulk of the drug we are not yet\r\nsufficiently acquainted.\r\n\r\n[247] In 1870, a British firm at Amoy opened an establishment for\r\npreparing opium for the supply of the Chinese in California and\r\nAustralia—_Pall Mall Gazette_, Nov. 7th, 1878, p. 7, announces:\r\n“The monopoly of preparing and selling opium in the 14 districts of\r\nKwang-chow-fu, has been leased to a Hong at Canton for 3 years, ...\r\ninnovation on former practice.... Opium shops are henceforth to be\r\nlicensed, and the Exchequer will receive the yearly sum of 140,000\r\ndollars—a welcome addition to the revenue.”\r\n\r\n[248] _Pharm. Journ._ vi. 234; vii. 183. with 4 beautiful plates\r\nrepresenting the crystallizations from extract and tincture of opium as\r\nwell as from the pure opium constituents. When the juice of the poppy\r\nis prevented from rapid drying by the addition of a little glycerin,\r\ncrystals are developed in it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place (independently of water) there is found mucilage\r\ndistinct from that of gum arabic, also pectic matter,[249] and albumin.\r\nThese bodies, together with unavoidable fragments of the poppy\r\ncapsules, probably amount on an average to more than half the weight of\r\nthe opium.[250]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these substances, the juice also contains sugar in\r\nsolution,—in French opium to the extent of 6½ to 8 per cent.: according\r\nto Decharme it is uncrystallizable. Sugar also exists in other opium,\r\nbut whether always naturally has not been determined.\r\n\r\nFresh poppy-juice contains in the form of emulsion, wax, pectin,\r\nalbumin and insoluble calcareous salts. When good Turkey opium is\r\ntreated with water these substances remain in the residue to the extent\r\nof 6 to 10 per cent.\r\n\r\nHesse (1870) has isolated the _wax_ by exhausting the refuse of opium\r\nwith boiling alcohol and a little lime. He thus obtained a crystalline\r\nmass from which he separated by chloroform _Palmitate_ and _Cerotate of\r\nCerotyl_, the former in the larger proportion.\r\n\r\nThe presence of _Caoutchouc_ has also been pointed out; Procter[251]\r\nfound opium produced in Vermont to contain about 11 per cent. of that\r\nsubstance, together with a little fatty matter and resin.\r\n\r\nRespecting the colouring matter and an extremely small quantity of a\r\nvolatile body with pepper-like odour, we know but little. After the\r\ncolouring matter has been precipitated from an aqueous solution of\r\nopium by lead acetate, the liquid becomes again coloured by exposure\r\nto the air. As to the volatile body, it may be removed by acetone or\r\nbenzol, but has not yet been isolated.\r\n\r\nThe salts of inorganic bases, chiefly of calcium, magnesium and\r\npotassium, contain partly the ordinary acids such as phosphoric and\r\nsulphuric, and partly an acid peculiar to the poppy.\r\n\r\nGood opium of Asia Minor dried at 100° C. yields 4 to 8 per cent. of\r\nash.\r\n\r\nPoppy-juice contains neither starch nor tannic acid, the absence of\r\nwhich easily detected substances affords one criterion for judging of\r\nthe purity of the drug.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of water in opium is very variable. In drying Turkey\r\nopium previous to pulverization and for other pharmaceutical purposes,\r\nthe average loss is about 12½ per cent.[252] Bengal opium, which\r\nresembles a soft black extract, is manufactured so as to contain 30 per\r\ncent. of water.\r\n\r\n[249] We had the opportunity of examining very good specimens of pectic\r\nmatter and caoutchouc from opium, with which we were presented (1879)\r\nby Messrs. J. F. Macfarlane & Co., of London and Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n[250] Flückiger, in _Pharm. Journ._ x. (1869) 208.\r\n\r\n[251] _American Journ. of Pharm._, 1870. 124.\r\n\r\n[252] From the laboratory accounts of Messrs. Allen and Hanburys,\r\nLondon, by which it appears that 200 lb. of Turkey opium dried at\r\nvarious times in the course of 10 years lost in weight 25¼ lb.\r\n\r\nAs the active constituents of opium, or at all events the morphine, can\r\nbe completely extracted by cold water, the proportion of soluble matter\r\nis of practical importance. In good opium of Asia Minor previously\r\ndried, the extract (dried at 100° C.) always amounts to between 55\r\nand 66 per cent.,—generally to more than 60, thus affording in many\r\ninstances a test of the pureness of the drug. Dried Indian opium yields\r\nfrom 60 to 68 per cent. of matter soluble in cold water.[253]\r\n\r\nThe peculiar constituents of opium are of basic, acid, or neutral\r\nnature. Some of these substances were observed in opium as early as\r\nthe 17th and 18th century, and designated _Magisterium Opii_. Bucholz\r\nin 1802 vainly endeavoured to obtain a salt from the extract by\r\ncrystallization. In 1803, however, Charles Derosne, an apothecary of\r\nParis, in diluting a syrupy aqueous extract of opium, observed crystals\r\nof the substance now called _Narcotine_, which he prepared pure. He\r\nbelieved that the same body was obtained by precipitating the mother\r\nliquor with an alkali, but what he so got was morphine. It is needless\r\nto pursue the further researches of Derosne. Ingenious as they were,\r\nit was reserved for Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Sertürner, apothecary of\r\nEinbeck in Hanover (_nat. 1783_, _ob. 1841_) to discover their true\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nSertürner had been engaged since 1805 with the chemical investigation\r\nof opium, and in 1816 he summarized his results in the statement that\r\nhe had enriched science (we now translate his own words[254])—“not only\r\nwith the knowledge of a remarkable new vegetable acid [_Mekonsäure_\r\n(meconic acid) which he had made known as _Opiumsäure_ in 1806], but\r\nalso with the discovery of a new alkaline salifiable base, _Morphium_,\r\none of the most remarkable substances, and apparently related to\r\nammonia.” Sertürner in fact distinctly recognised the basic nature and\r\nthe organic constitution of morphium (now called _Morphine_, _Morphia_,\r\nor _Morphinum_), and prepared a number of its crystalline salts. He\r\nlikewise demonstrated the poisonous nature of these substances by\r\nexperiments on himself and others. Lastly, he pointed out, though\r\nvery incorrectly, the difference between morphine and the so-called\r\n_Opium-salt_ (Narcotine) of Derosne. It is possible that this latter\r\nchemist may have had morphine in his hands at the same time as\r\nSertürner, or even earlier. This honour is also due to Séguin, whose\r\npaper “_Sur l’Opium_” read at the Institute, December 24, 1804, was,\r\nstrange to say, not published till 1814.[255] To Sertürner, however,\r\nundoubtedly belongs the merit of first making known the existence of\r\norganic alkalis in the vegetable kingdom,[256]—a series of bodies\r\npractically interminable. As to opium, it still remains after nearly\r\nseventy years a _nidus_ of new substances.\r\n\r\nSolutions of morphine in acids or in alkalis rotate the plane of\r\npolarization to the left.\r\n\r\nThe morphine in opium is combined with meconic acid, and is therefore\r\neasily soluble in water.[257] The _Narcotine_ is present in the free\r\nstate, and can be extracted by chloroform, boiling alcohol, benzol,\r\nether, or volatile oils,[258] but not by water. It dissolves in 3\r\nparts of chloroform, in 20 of boiling alcohol, in 21 of benzol, in 40\r\nof boiling ether. Its alkaline properties are very weak, and it does\r\nnot affect vegetable colours. If we examine opium by the microscope we\r\ncannot at once detect the presence of narcotine, but if first moistened\r\nwith glycerin, numerous large crystals may generally be found after the\r\nlapse of some days. If the opium has been previously exhausted with\r\nbenzol or ether, in order to remove the narcotine, no such crystals\r\nwill be formed. Hence it follows that narcotine pre-exists in an\r\namorphous state.\r\n\r\n[253] Calculated from official statements given by Eatwell in the paper\r\nquoted at p. 50.\r\n\r\n[254] Gilbert’s _Annalen der Physik_, lv. (1817) 57.\r\n\r\n[255] _Annales de Chimie_, xcii (1814) 225.\r\n\r\n[256] The Institut de France on the 27th June, 1831, awarded to\r\nSertürner a prize of 2000 francs—“pour avoir reconnu la nature alcaline\r\nde la morphine, et avoir ainsi ouvert une voie qui produit de grandes\r\ndécouvertes médicales.”\r\n\r\n[257] There are exceptional cases in which it is asserted that water\r\ndoes _not_ take up the whole amount of morphine.\r\n\r\n[258] In large crystals by means of oil of turpentine.\r\n\r\nBy decomposition with sulphuric acid, narcotine yields _Cotarnine_, an\r\nundoubted base, together with _Opianic Acid_, and certain derivatives\r\nof the latter.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of another base, _Codeine_, was made in 1832 by Robiquet.\r\nIt dissolves in 17 parts of boiling water, forming a highly alkaline\r\nsolution which perfectly saturates acids, and exhibits in polarized\r\nlight a levogyre power. Codeine is also readily soluble at ordinary\r\ntemperatures in 7 parts amylic alcohol, and in 11 of benzol.\r\n\r\nThe codeine of commerce is in very large crystals containing 2 atoms =\r\n5·66 per cent. of water. By crystallization from ether the alkaloid may\r\nbe obtained in small anhydrous crystals.\r\n\r\nSince 1832 other alkaloids have been found in opium, as may be seen in\r\nthe following table, which includes all the 17 now known.[259]\r\n\r\nA very large number of derivatives of several among them have been\r\nprepared, of which we point out a few in smaller type. The molecular\r\nconstitution of these opium alkaloids being not yet thoroughly\r\nsettled, we add only their empirical formulæ, which however exhibit\r\nunmistakeable connections.\r\n\r\n_Papaverosine_ discovered by Deschamps in poppy heads (p. 42) can\r\nhardly be absent from opium. In some points it appears to resemble\r\ncryptopine.\r\n\r\nAmong the peculiar non-basic constituents of opium, the first to call\r\nfor notice is _Meconic Acid_, C₇H₄O₇, discovered, as already observed,\r\nby Sertürner in 1805. It is distinguished by the red colour which it\r\nproduces with ferric salts, the same as that of ferric sulphocyanate;\r\nbut the latter only dissolves in ether. Meconic acid is soluble in\r\n4 parts of boiling water, but immediately gives off CO₂, and the\r\nremaining solution instead of depositing micaceous crystalline scales\r\nof meconic acid, yields on cooling (but best after boiling with\r\nhydrochloric acid) hard granular crystals of _Comenic Acid_, C₆H₄O₅.\r\n\r\n_Lactic Acid_ was discovered by T. and H. Smith in the opium-liquors\r\nproduced in the manufacture of morphine. These chemists regarded it as\r\na peculiar body, and under the name of _Thebolactic Acid_, exhibited it\r\ntogether with its copper and morphine salts at the London International\r\nExhibition of 1862. Its identity with ordinary lactic acid was\r\nascertained by Stenhouse (whose experiments have not been published)\r\nand also by J. Y. Buchanan.[260] T. and H. Smith consider it to be a\r\nregular constituent of Turkey opium; they obtained it as a calcium salt\r\nto the amount of about 2 per cent., and have prepared it in this form\r\nand in a pure state to the extent of over 100 lb. In our opinion it is\r\nnot an original constituent of poppy-juice.\r\n\r\n[259] In 1851 Hinterberger described as a peculiar alkaloid,\r\n_Opianine_; Dr. Hesse has examined Hinterberger’s specimen of this\r\nbody, and found (1875) it to consist of impure narcotine.\r\n\r\n[260] _Berichte d.

It has been called _Opianyl_\r\nor (by Couerbe) _Meconine_. It has the composition C₁₀H₁₀O₄ =\r\nC₆H₂·CH₂·O·CO(OCH₃)₂. Meconin forms prisms which fuse under water at\r\n77° C. or _per se_ at 110°, and distil at 155°; it dissolves in about\r\n20 parts of boiling water, from which it may be readily crystallized.\r\nMeconin may be formed by heating narcotine with nitric acid.\r\n\r\nAn analogous substance _Meconoiosin_ C₈H₁₀O₂ = C₆H₂·(OH)₂·(CH₃)₂, has\r\nbeen discovered in 1878 by T. and H. Smith. Meconoiosin is readily\r\nsoluble in 27 parts of cold water, and melts at 88° C. When heated with\r\nslightly diluted sulphuric acid, and when the evaporation has reached\r\na certain point, meconoiosin produces a deep red; with meconin the\r\ncoloration is a beautiful green.\r\n\r\n=Proportion of peculiar constituents=—The substances described in the\r\nforegoing section exist in opium in very variable proportion; and as it\r\nis on their presence, but especially that of morphine, that the value\r\nof the drug depends, the importance of exact estimation is evident.\r\n\r\nOpium whether required for analysis or for pharmaceutical preparations\r\nhas to be taken _exclusively in the dry state_. The amount of water\r\nit contains is so uncertain that the drug must be reduced to a fixed\r\nstandard by complete desiccation at 100° C., before any given weight is\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n_=Morphine=_—Guibourt[262] who analysed a large number of samples of\r\nopium, and whose skill and care in such research are not disputed,\r\nobtained from a sample of French opium produced near Amiens, 22·88 per\r\ncent. of morphine crystallized from spirit of wine. This percentage has\r\nnot to our knowledge been ever exceeded. From another specimen produced\r\nin the same district he got 21·23 per cent., from a third 20·67. The\r\nlowest percentage from a French opium was 14·96,—in each case reckoned\r\non material previously dried.\r\n\r\nChevallier extracted from opium grown by Aubergier at Clermont in the\r\ncentre of France, 17·50 per cent. of morphine. Decharmes from a French\r\nopium obtained 17·6 per cent., and Biltz from a German opium 20 per\r\ncent. Opium produced in Württemberg sent to the Vienna Exhibition of\r\n1873 afforded Hesse 12 to 15 per cent. of morphine; and opium from\r\nSilesia 9 to 10 per cent.[263]\r\n\r\nA pure American opium collected in the State of Vermont yielded Proctor\r\n15·75 per cent. of morphine and 2 percent of narcotine.[264]\r\n\r\nThe opium of Asia Minor furnishes very nearly the same proportions of\r\nmorphine as that of Europe. The maximum recorded by Guibourt is 21·46\r\nper cent. obtained from a Smyrna opium sold in Paris. The mean yield of\r\n8 samples of opium sent by Della Sudda of Constantinople to the Paris\r\nExhibition of 1855 was 14·78 per cent. The mean percentage of morphine\r\nafforded by 12 other samples of Turkey opium obtained from various\r\nsources was 14·66.\r\n\r\n[261] _Annales de Chimie et de Physique_, xlix. (1832) 5-20.—The paper\r\nwas read before the Acad. de Méd., 13th May, 1826.\r\n\r\n[262] _Mémoire sur le dosage de l’Opium et sur la quantité de morphine\r\nque l’opium doit contenir_, Paris, 1862.\r\n\r\n[263] Schroff, _Ausstellungsbericht, Arzneiwaaren_, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[264] _Am. Journ. of Pharm._ xviii. (1870) 124.\r\n\r\nChevallier[265] states that Smyrna opium, of which several cases were\r\nreceived by Merck of Darmstadt in 1845, afforded 12 to 13 per cent. of\r\npure morphine reckoned upon the drug in its _fresh and moist state_.\r\n\r\nFayk Bey[266] analysed 92 samples of opium of Asia Minor, and found\r\nthat half the number yielded more than 10 per cent. of morphine. The\r\nrichest afforded 17·2 per cent.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing statements we are warranted in assuming that _good_\r\nSmyrna opium deprived of water ought to afford 12 to 15 per cent. of\r\nmorphine, and that if the percentage is less than 10, adulteration may\r\nbe suspected.\r\n\r\nEgyptian opium has usually been found very much weaker in morphine\r\nthan that of Asia Minor. A sample sent to the Paris Exhibition of 1865\r\nand presented to one of us by Figari Bey of Cairo, afforded us 5·8 per\r\ncent. of morphine and 8·7 of narcotine.\r\n\r\nPersian opium appears extremely variable, probably in consequence of\r\nthe practice of combining it with sugar and other substances. It is\r\nhowever sometimes very good. Séput[267] obtained from four samples\r\nthe respective percentages of 13·47, 11·52, 10·12, 10·08 of morphine,\r\nthe opium being free from water. Mr. Howard as already stated (p. 49)\r\nextracted from Persian opium, not previously dried, from 8 to 10·75 per\r\ncent. of morphine.\r\n\r\nEast Indian opium is remarkable for its low percentage of morphine,\r\na circumstance which we think is attributable in part to climate and\r\nin part to a method of collection radically defective. It is scarcely\r\nconceivable that the long period during which the juice remains in a\r\nwet state,—always three to four weeks,—does not exercise a destructive\r\naction on its constituents.\r\n\r\nAccording to Eatwell[268] the percentage of morphine in the samples\r\nof Benares opium officially submitted for analysis gave the following\r\naverages.—\r\n\r\n    1845-46    1846-47    1847-48    1848-49\r\n     2·48       2·38       2·20       3·21\r\n\r\nThe same observer has recorded the results of the examination of\r\nfreshly collected poppy-juice, which in three instances afforded\r\nrespectively 1·4, 3·06, and 2·89 per cent. of morphine, reckoned on\r\nthe material deprived of water; but the conditions under which the\r\nexperiments were made appear open to great objection.[269]\r\n\r\nSuch very low results are not always obtained from East Indian opium.\r\nIn a sample from Khandesh furnished by the Indian Museum, we found 6·07\r\nof morphine. Solly from the same kind obtained about 7 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Patna Garden Opium_ which is the sort prepared exclusively for\r\nmedicinal use, afforded us 8·6 per cent. of purified morphine and 4\r\nper cent. of narcotine.[270] Guibourt obtained from such an opium 7·72\r\nper cent. Christison from a sample sent to Duncan of Edinburgh in\r\n1830,[271] 9·50 per cent. of hydrochlorate of morphine.\r\n\r\n[265] _Notice historique sur l’opium indigène_, Paris, 1852.\r\n\r\n[266] _Monographie des Opiums de l’Empire Ottoman envoyés à\r\nl’Exposition de Paris_, 1867.\r\n\r\n[267] _Journ. de Pharm._ xxxix. (1861) 163.\r\n\r\n[268] _Pharm. Journ._ xi. (1852) 361.\r\n\r\n[269] In one case the juice was allowed to stand in a basin from 23rd\r\nFeb. to 7th May, being “occasionally stirred”!\r\n\r\n[270] This drug made in 1838 came from the Apothecary-General,\r\nCalcutta, and was presented by Christison to the Kew Museum. It is in\r\nrectangular tablets 2½ inches square and ¾ of an inch thick, cased in\r\nwax.\r\n\r\n[271] The actual specimen is in the Kew Museum.\r\n\r\nSamples from the Indian Museum placed at our disposal by Dr. J. Forbes\r\nWatson gave[272] us the following percentages of morphine:—_Medical\r\n(Indian) Opium_, 1852-53, portion of a square brick, 4·3; _Garden\r\nBehar Opium_, 4·6; _Abkāri Provision Opium_, _Patna_, No. 5380, 3·5;\r\n_Sind Opium_, No. 28, 3·8; _Opium, Hyderabad_, _Sind_, 3·2 (and 5·4 of\r\nnarcotine); _Malwa Opium_, 6·1.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the percentage of morphine in _Chinese Opium_, the\r\nfollowing data have been obligingly furnished to us by Mr. T. W.\r\nSheppard, F.C.S., Opium Examiner to the Benares Opium Agency, of\r\nanalyses made by himself from samples of the drug procured in China by\r\nSir R. Alcock:—Szechuen opium, 2·2; Kweichow, 2·5; Yunnan, 4·1; Kansu,\r\n5·1 per cent. Mr. S. informs us that Dr. Eatwell obtained in 1852 from\r\nSzechuen opium 3·3, and from Kweichow opium 6·1[273] per cent.—the\r\nopium in all instances being reckoned as _dry_. The samples examined by\r\nMr. S. contained 86 to 95 per cent. of dry opium, and yielded (undried)\r\n36 to 53 per cent. of extract soluble in cold water. The proportion of\r\nmorphine in the sample of Chinese opium analysed by Dr. Jamieson (p.\r\n55) was nearly 7·2 per cent. calculated on the dry drug.\r\n\r\n_Pseudomorphine_—occurs only in very small quantities. Hesse found it\r\nin some sorts of opium to the extent of 0·02 per cent.—in others still\r\nless.\r\n\r\n_Codeine_—has been found in Smyrna, French and Indian opium, but only\r\nto the extent of ⅕ to ⅖ per cent. T. and H. Smith give the proportion\r\nin Turkey opium as 0·3 per cent.[274]\r\n\r\n_=Thebaine=_—which has likewise been obtained from French opium,\r\namounts in Turkey opium according to Merck to about 1 per cent. In the\r\nlatter sort T. and H. Smith found only about 8·15 per cent., but of\r\n\r\n_Papaverine_—in the same drug, 1 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Narcotine_—exists in opium in widely different proportions and often\r\nin considerable abundance. Thus Schindler obtained in 1834 from a\r\nSmyrna opium yielding 10·30 per cent. of morphine, 1·30 per cent. of\r\nnarcotine. Biltz (1831) analysed an oriental opium which afforded 9·25\r\nper cent. of morphine and 7·50 of narcotine. Reveil (1860) obtained\r\nfrom Persian opium not rich in morphine, from half as much to twice as\r\nmuch narcotine as morphine. The utmost of narcotine was 9·90 per cent.\r\nWe have found in German opium of undubitable purity[275] 10·9 per cent.\r\nof narcotine.\r\n\r\nEast Indian opium was found by Eatwell (1850) always to afford more\r\nnarcotine than morphine,—frequently twice as much. The sample from\r\nKhandesh referred to on the opposite page, afforded us 7·7 per cent. of\r\npure narcotine.\r\n\r\nFrench opium collected from the _Pavot œillette_ sometimes affords\r\nneither narcotine, thebaine, nor narceine.[276]\r\n\r\n[272] _Pharm. Journ._ v. (1875) 845.\r\n\r\n[273] This sample, the richest of all in morphine, is noted as of “_2nd\r\nquality_.”\r\n\r\n[274] _Pharm. Journ._ vii. (1866) 183.\r\n\r\n[275] Collected in 1829 by Biltz and obligingly placed in 1867 at my\r\ndisposal by his son.—F. A. F.\r\n\r\n[276] The statement of Biltz (1831) that an opium collected by himself\r\nfrom poppies grown in 1829 at Erfurt afforded 33 per cent. of narcotine\r\nis contrary to the experience of all other chemists. The same must be\r\nsaid of Mulder’s assertion respecting an opium giving 6 to 13 per cent.\r\nof narceine.\r\n\r\n_Narceine_—Of this substance Couerbe found in opium 0·1 per cent.; T.\r\nand H. Smith 0·02 and Schindler 0·71.\r\n\r\n_Cryptopine_—exists in opium in very small proportion. T. and H. Smith\r\nstate that since the alkaloid first came under their notice, they have\r\ncollected of it altogether about 5 ounces in the form of hydrochlorate,\r\nand this small quantity in operating on many thousands of pounds of\r\nopium. But they by no means assert that the whole of the cryptopine was\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n_Rhœadine_—is also found only in exceedingly minute quantity.\r\n\r\n_Meconic Acid_—If the average amount of morphine in opium be estimated\r\nat 15 per cent., and the alkaloid be supposed to exist as a tribasic\r\nmeconate, it would require for saturation 3·4 per cent. of meconic\r\nacid. Wittstein obtained rather more than 3 per cent., T. and H. Smith\r\n4 per cent., and Decharmes 4·33. Opium produced in Vermont yielded,\r\naccording to Proctor (1870) 5·25 per cent. of meconic acid. The\r\nquantity of acid required to unite with the other bases assuming them\r\nto exist as salts can be but extremely small.\r\n\r\n=Estimation of Morphine in Opium=—The practical valuation of opium\r\nturns in the first instance upon the estimation of the water present\r\nin the drug, and in the second upon the proportion which the latter\r\ncontains of morphine.[277]\r\n\r\nThe first question is determined by exposing a known quantity of the\r\ndrug divided into small slices or fragments to the heat of a water-bath\r\nuntil it cease to lose weight.\r\n\r\nFor the estimation of the morphine many processes have been devised,\r\nbut none is perfectly satisfactory.[278] That which we recommend is\r\nthus performed:—Take of opium previously dried at 100° C., as above\r\nstated, and powdered, 10 grammes; shake it with 100 grammes alcohol\r\n0·950 sp. gr., and filter after a day or two. The weight of the liquid\r\nshould be made equal to 100 grammes. Add to it 50 grammes of ether and\r\n2 grammes of ammonia water 0·960 sp. gr.; collect the crystals of opium\r\nwhich separate slowly, after a day or two, dry them at 100° C., and\r\nweigh them.—On applying this method to Indian opium, we were but little\r\nsatisfied with it.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—By official statistics it appears that the quantity of opium\r\nimported into the United Kingdom in 1872 was 356,211 lb., valued at\r\n£361,503. The imports from Asiatic and European Turkey are stated in\r\nthe same tables thus:—\r\n\r\n      1868          1870          1872          1874\r\n    317,133 lb.   276,691 lb.   325,572 lb.   514,000 lb.\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident that the drug used in Great Britain is chiefly\r\nTurkish. The import of opium from Persia has been very irregular. In\r\n1871, 21,894 lb. are reported as received from that country; in 1872,\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n[277] In selecting a sample for analysis, care should be taken that\r\nit fairly represents the bulk of the drug. We prefer to take a little\r\npiece from each of several lumps, mix them in a mortar, and weigh from\r\nthe mixed sample the required quantity.\r\n\r\n[278] See also Proctor, _Pharm. Journ._ vii. (1876) 244, and _Yearbook\r\nof Pharm._ 1877. 528.\r\n\r\nExcept that a little Malwa opium has occasionally been imported, it\r\nmay be asserted the opium of India is entirely unknown in the English\r\nmarket, and that none of it is to be found even in London in the\r\nwarehouse of any druggist.\r\n\r\nAs to other countries, we may point out that in 1876 the import of\r\nopium (prepared) into the colony of Victoria was valued at £104,557.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Opium possesses sedative powers which are universally known. In\r\nthe words of Pereira, it is the most important and valuable medicine of\r\nthe whole Materia Medica; and we may add, the source by its judicious\r\nemployment of more happiness and by its abuse of more misery[279] than\r\nany other drug employed by mankind.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The manifold falsifications of opium have been already\r\nnoticed, and the method by which its more important alkaloid may be\r\nestimated has been pointed out. Moreover as already stated, neither\r\ntannic acid nor starch ever occur in genuine opium; and the proportion\r\nof ash left upon the incineration of a good opium does not exceed 4\r\nto 8 per cent. of the dried drug. Another criterion is afforded by\r\nthe amount soluble in cold water which ought to exceed 55 per cent.\r\nreckoned on dry opium. Finally, if we are correct, the gum contained in\r\npure opium is distinct from gum arabic, being precipitable by neutral\r\nacetate of lead. If we exhaust with water opium falsified with gum\r\narabic, the mucilage peculiar to opium will be precipitated by neutral\r\nacetate of lead, the liquid separated from the precipitate will still\r\ncontain the gum arabic which may be thrown down by alcohol. If gum is\r\npresent to some extent, an abundant precipitate is produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUCIFERÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEN SINAPIS NIGRÆ.\r\n\r\n_Black, Brown or Red Mustard_; F. _Moutarde noire ou grise_; G.\r\n_Schwarzer Senf_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Brassica nigra_ Koch (_Sinapis nigra_ L.). Black\r\nMustard is found wild over the whole of Europe excepting the extreme\r\nnorth. It also occurs in Northern Africa, Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, the\r\nCaucasian region, Western India, as well as in Southern Siberia and\r\nChina. By cultivation, which is conducted on a large scale in many\r\ncountries (as Alsace, Bohemia, Holland, England and Italy), it has\r\ndoubtless been diffused through regions where it did not anciently\r\nexist. It has now become naturalized both in North and South America.\r\n\r\n=History=—Mustard was well known to the ancients. Theophrastus mentions\r\nit as Νάπμ,—Dioscorides as Νάπμ or Σίνηπι. Pliny notices three kinds\r\nwhich have been referred by Fée[280] to _Brassica nigra_ Koch, _B.\r\nalba_ Hook. f. et Th., and to a South European species, _Diplotaxis\r\nerucoides_ DC. (_Sinapis erucoides_ L.). The use of mustard seems up\r\nto this period to have been more medicinal than dietetic. But from\r\nan edict of Diocletian, A.D. 301[281] in which it is mentioned along\r\nwith alimentary substances, we must suppose it was then regarded as a\r\ncondiment at least in the eastern parts of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n[279] See Tingling, J.

The price of the seed between A.D. 1285 and 1395 varied\r\nfrom 1_s._ 3_d._ to 6_s._ 8_d._ per quarter, but in 1347 and 1376 it\r\nwas as high as 15_s._ and 16_s._[283] In the accounts of the abbey\r\nof St. Germain-des-Prés in Paris, commencing A.D. 800, mustard is\r\nspecifically mentioned as a regular part of the revenue of the convent\r\nlands.[284]\r\n\r\nThe essential oil of mustard was, apparently, noticed about the year\r\n1660 by Nicolas Le Febvre (see in the article Rad. Inulae), more\r\ndistinctly in 1732 by Boerhaave. Its acridity and high specific\r\ngravity were pointed out by Murray.[285] Thibierge in 1819 observed\r\nthat sulphur was one of the constituents of the oil, and Guibourt[286]\r\nstated that it is not pre-existing in the seed.\r\n\r\n=Production=—Mustard is grown in England only on the richest alluvial\r\nsoils, and chiefly in the counties of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. Very\r\ngood seed is produced in Holland.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The pod of _Brassica nigra_ is smooth, erect, and closely\r\npressed against the axis of the long slender raceme. It has a strong\r\nnerve on each of its two valves and contains in each cell from 4 to\r\n6 spherical or slightly oval seeds. The seeds are about ¹/₂₅ of an\r\ninch in diameter and ¹/₅₀ of a grain in weight; they are of a dark\r\nreddish-brown. The surface is reticulated with minute pits, and often\r\nmore or less covered with a whitish pellicle which gives to some seeds\r\na grey colour.[287] The testa which is thin, brittle and translucent\r\nencloses an exalbuminous embryo having two short cotyledons folded\r\ntogether longitudinally and forming a sort of trough in which the\r\nradicle lies bent up. The embryo thus coiled into a ball completely\r\nfills the testa; the outer cotyledon is thicker than the inner, which\r\nviewed in transverse section seems to hold the radicle as a pair\r\nof forceps. The seeds when pulverized have a greenish yellow hue.\r\nMasticated they have for an instant a bitterish taste which however\r\nquickly becomes pungent. When triturated with water they afford a\r\nyellowish emulsion emitting a pungent acrid vapour which affects the\r\neyes, and has a strong acid reaction. The seeds powdered dry have no\r\nsuch pungency. When the seeds are triturated with solution of potash,\r\nthe pungent odour is not evolved; nor when they are boiled in water.\r\nNeither is the acridity developed on triturating them with alcohol,\r\ndilute mineral acids, or solution of tannin, or even with water when\r\nthey have been kept in powder for a long time.\r\n\r\n[282] Enclosed pasture land in England was rare, and there was but\r\nscanty provision for preserving stock through the winter, root crops\r\nbeing unknown. Hence in November there was a general slaughtering of\r\nsheep and oxen, the flesh of which was salted for winter use.—See also\r\n_Pharm. Journ._ viii. (1876, April 27) 862.\r\n\r\n[283] Rogers, _Hist. of Agriculture and Prices in England_, i. (1866)\r\n223.\r\n\r\n[284] Guérard, _Polyptique de l’Abbé Irminon_, Paris, i.

(1831) 360.\r\n\r\n[287] The grey colour of the seed, which is attributed to rain during\r\nthe ripening, is very detrimental to its value. The great aim of the\r\ngrower is to produce seed of a bright reddish-brown, with no grey seed\r\nintermixed.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The whitish pellicle already mentioned, which\r\ncovers the seed, is made up of hexagonal tabular cells. The epidermis\r\nconsists of one row of densely packed brown cells, radially elongated\r\nand having strong lateral and inner walls. Their outer walls on the\r\nother hand are thin and not coloured; they are not clearly obvious\r\nwhen seen under oil, but swell up very considerably in presence of\r\nwater, emitting mucilage.[288] Seeds immersed in water become therefore\r\ncovered with a glossy envelope, levelling down the superficial\r\ninequalities, so that the wet seed appears smooth. The tissue of the\r\ncotyledons exhibits large drops of fatty oil and granules of albumin.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—By distilling brown mustard with water, the seed\r\nhaving been previously macerated, the pungent principle, _Essential Oil\r\nof Mustard_, is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe oil, which has the composition SCN(C₃H⁵), (allyl isosulphocyanate),\r\nboils at 148° C.; it has a sp. gr. of 1·017, no rotatory power, and\r\nis soluble without coloration or turbidity in three times its weight\r\nor more of cold strong sulphuric acid. To this oil is due the pungent\r\nsmell and taste of mustard and its inflammatory action on the skin. As\r\nalready pointed out, mustard oil is not present in the dry seeds, but\r\nis produced only after they have been comminuted and mixed with water,\r\nthe temperature of which should not exceed 50° C.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable reaction which gives rise to the formation of\r\nmustard oil was explained by Will and Körner in 1863. They obtained\r\nfrom mustard a crystallizable substance, then termed _Myronate of\r\npotassium_, now called _Sinigrin_. It is to be regarded, according to\r\nthe admirable investigations of these chemists, as a compound of\r\n\r\n    Isosulphocyanate of allyl or mustard oil   C₄  H₆  NS\r\n    Bisulphate of potassium                        H   KS    O₄\r\n    Sugar (dextro-glucose)                     C₆  H₁₂       O₆\r\n                                               -----------------\r\n    so that the formula                        C₁₀ H₁₈  KNS₂  O₁₀\r\n\r\nis that of sinigrin. It does in fact split into the above-mentioned\r\nthree substances when dissolved in water and brought into contact with\r\n_Myrosin_.\r\n\r\n[288] Most minutely described and figured by F. von Höhnel, in\r\nHaberlandt’s _Untersuchungen auf dem Gebiete des Pflanzenbaues_, i.\r\n(Vienna, 1875) 171-202.\r\n\r\nThis albuminous body discovered by Bussy in 1839, but the composition\r\nof which has not been made out, likewise undergoes a certain\r\ndecomposition under these circumstances. Sinigrin may likewise be\r\ndecomposed by alkalis and, according to Ludwig and Lange, by silver\r\nnitrate. These chemists obtained sinigrin from the seeds in the\r\nproportion of 0·5 per cent.; Will and Körner got 0·5 to 0·6 per cent.\r\nThe extraction of the substance is therefore attended with great loss,\r\nas the minimum yield of volatile oil, 0·42 per cent. indicates 2·36 of\r\npotassium myronate.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous solution of myrosin coagulates at 60° C. and then becomes\r\ninactive: hence mustard seed which has been heated to 100° C. or has\r\nbeen roasted yields no volatile oil, nor does it yield any if powdered\r\nand introduced at once into boiling water. The proportion of myrosin in\r\nmustard has not been exactly determined. The total amount of nitrogen\r\nin the seed is 2·9 per cent. (Hoffmann) which would correspond to 18\r\nper cent. of myrosin, supposing the proportion of nitrogen in that\r\nsubstance to be the same as in albumin, and the total quantity of\r\nnitrogen to belong to it. Sometimes black mustard contains so little of\r\nit, that an emulsion of white mustard requires to be added in order to\r\ndevelop all the volatile oil it is capable of yielding.\r\n\r\nAn emulsion of mustard or a solution of pure sinigrin brought into\r\ncontact with myrosin, frequently deposits sulphur by decomposition of\r\nthe allyl sulphocyanide, hence crude oil of mustard sometimes contains\r\na considerable proportion (even half) of _Allyl cyanide_, C₄H₅N,\r\ndistinguished by its lower sp. gr. (0·839) and lower boiling point\r\n(118° C.).\r\n\r\nThe seeds, roots, or herbaceous part of many other plants of the order\r\n_Cruciferæ_ yield a volatile oil composed in part of mustard oil and in\r\npart of allyl sulphide\r\n\r\n             C₂H₅}\r\n    C₆H₁₀S =     } S,\r\n             C₃H₅}\r\n\r\nwhich latter is likewise obtainable from the bulbs of garlic. Many\r\n_Cruciferæ_ afford from their roots or seeds chiefly or solely oil\r\nof mustard, and from their leaves oil of garlic. As to other plants,\r\nthe roots of _Reseda lutea_ L. and _R. luteola_ L. have been shown by\r\nVolhard (1871) to afford oil of mustard.[289] The strong smell given\r\noff by the crushed seeds or roots of several Mimoseæ, as for instance,\r\n_Albizzia lophantha_ Benth. (_Acacia_ Willd.) is perhaps due to some\r\nallied compound.\r\n\r\nThe artificial preparation of mustard oil was discovered in 1855 by\r\nZinin, and at the same time also by Berthelot and De Luca. It may be\r\nobtained in decomposing bromide of allyl by means of sulphocyanate of\r\nammonium:—\r\n\r\n    C₃H₅Br · SCN(NH₄) = NH₄Br · C₃H₅SCN.\r\n\r\nThe liquid C₃H₅SCN, boiling at 161°, is sulphocyanate of allyl; if it\r\nis gently warmed with a little alcoholic potash, and then acidulated,\r\nthe red coloration of ferric sulphocyanate is produced on addition of\r\nperchloride of iron, but by submitting the sulphocyanate of allyl to\r\ndistillation it is at once transformed in the isosulphocyanate, _i.e._\r\nin mustard oil; the latter is not coloured by ferric salts, but it\r\nwould appear that in the cold emulsion of mustard, even at 0°, a little\r\nsulphocyanate makes also its appearance.\r\n\r\nMustard submitted to pressure affords about 23 per cent.[290] of a\r\nmild-tasting, inodorous, non-drying oil, solidifying when cooled to\r\n-17·5° C., and consisting of the glycerin compounds of stearic, oleic\r\nand _Erucic_ or _Brassic Acid_. The last named acid, C₂₂H₄₂O₂, occurs\r\nalso in the fixed oil of white mustard and of rape, and is homologous\r\nwith oleic acid. Darby (1849) has pointed out the existence of another\r\nbody, _Sinapoleic Acid_, C₂₀H₃⁸O₂, which occurs in the fixed oil of\r\nboth black and white mustard. Goldschmiedt, in 1874, ascertained the\r\npresence also of _Behenic Acid_, C₂₂H₄₄O₂ in black mustard. Sinigrin\r\nbeing not altered by the extraction of the fatty oil, either by\r\npressure or by means of bisulphide of carbon, the powdered seed,\r\ndeprived of fatty oil, still yields the whole amount of the irritating\r\n“essential” oil. This important fact has been ingeniously used by\r\nRigollot[291] for the preparation of his mustard paper.\r\n\r\n[289] See also _Radix Armoraciæ_, p. 68.\r\n\r\n[290] I have obtained as much as 33·8 per cent. by means of boiling\r\nether.—F. A. F.\r\n\r\n[291] _Journ. de Pharm._ vi. (1867) 269.\r\n\r\nMustard seed when ripe is devoid of starch; the mucilage which its\r\nepidermis affords amounts to 19 per cent. of the seed (Hoffmann).\r\nThe ash constituents amounting to 4 per cent. consist chiefly of the\r\nphosphates of calcium, magnesium, and potassium.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Black mustard is employed in the form of poultice as a powerful\r\nexternal stimulant; but it is rarely used in its pure state, as\r\nthe _Flour of Mustard_ prepared for the table, which contains in\r\naddition white mustard, answers perfectly well and is at hand in every\r\nhouse.[292]\r\n\r\nThe essential oil of mustard dissolved in spirit of wine is\r\noccasionally prescribed as a liniment.\r\n\r\n=Substitute=—_Brassica juncea_ Hook. f. et Th. (_Sinapis juncea_\r\nL.) is extensively cultivated throughout India (where _B. nigra_ is\r\nrarely grown), Central Africa, and generally in warm countries where\r\nit replaces _B. nigra_ and is applied to the same uses. Its seeds\r\nconstitute a portion of the mustard of Europe, as we may infer from\r\nthe fact that British India exported in the year 1871-72, of “_Mustard\r\nseed_” 1418 tons, of which 790 tons were shipped to the United Kingdom,\r\nand 516 tons to France.[293] _B. juncea_ is largely grown in the south\r\nof Russia and in the steppes north-east of the Caspian where it appears\r\nto flourish particularly well in the saline soil. At Sarepta in the\r\nGovernment of Saratov, an establishment has existed since the beginning\r\nof the present century where this sort of mustard is prepared for use\r\nto the extent of 800 tons of seed annually. The seeds make a fine\r\nyellow powder employed both for culinary and medicinal purposes. By\r\npressure they yield more than 20 per cent. of fixed oil which is used\r\nin Russia like the best olive oil. The seeds closely resemble those\r\nof _B. nigra_ and afford when distilled the same essential oil; it is\r\nlargely made at Kiew.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEN SINAPIS ALBÆ.\r\n\r\n_White Mustard_; F. _Moutarde blanche ou Anglaise_; G. _Weisser Senf_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Brassica alba_ Hook. f. et Th. (_Sinapis alba_ L.)\r\nThis plant appears to belong to the more southern countries of Europe\r\nand Western Asia. According to Chinese authors[294] it was introduced\r\ninto China from the latter region. Its cultivation in England is of\r\nrecent introduction, but is rapidly extending.[295] The plant is not\r\nuncommon as a weed on cultivated land.\r\n\r\n[292] The best _Flour of Mustard_ such as is made by the large\r\nmanufacturers, contains nothing but brown and white mustard seeds. But\r\nthe lower and cheaper qualities made by the same firms contain flour,\r\nturmeric, and capsicum. Unmixed flour of Black Mustard is however kept\r\nfor those who care to purchase it.\r\n\r\n[293] _Annual Statement of the Trade and Navigation of British India_,\r\nCalcutta, 1872. 62.\r\n\r\n[294] Bretschneider, _Study of Chinese Botan. Works_, 1870. 17.\r\n\r\n[295] Morton’s _Cycloped. of Agriculture_, ii. (1855) 440.\r\n\r\n=History=—White mustard was used in former times indiscriminately\r\nwith the brown. In the materia medica of the _London Pharmacopœia_\r\nof 1720 the two sorts are separately prescribed. The important\r\nchemical distinction between them was first made known in 1831 by\r\nBoutron-Charlard and Robiquet.[296]\r\n\r\n=Production=—White mustard is grown as an agricultural crop in Essex\r\nand Cambridgeshire.\r\n\r\n=Description=—_Brassica alba_ differs from _B. nigra_ in having the\r\npods bristly and spreading. They are about an inch long, half the\r\nlength being occupied by a flat veiny beak. Each pod contains 4 to 6\r\nyellowish seeds about ¹/₁₂ of an inch in diameter and ⅒ of a grain in\r\nweight. The brittle, nearly transparent and colourless testa encloses\r\nan embryo of a bright pure yellow and of the same structure as that\r\nof black mustard. The surface of the testa is likewise pitted in a\r\nreticulate manner, but so finely that it appears smooth except under a\r\nhigh magnifying power.\r\n\r\nWhen triturated with water the seeds form a yellowish emulsion of very\r\npungent taste, but it is inodorous and does not under any circumstances\r\nyield a volatile oil. The powdered seeds made into a paste with cold\r\nwater act as a highly stimulating cataplasm. The entire seeds yield to\r\ncold water an abundance of mucilage.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The epidermal cells of white mustard afford a\r\ngood illustration of a mucilage-yielding layer such as is met with,\r\nunder many variations, in the seeds of numerous plants. The cuticle\r\nconsists of large vaulted cells, exhibiting very regular hexagonal\r\noutlines when cut across.[297] The inner layer of the epidermis is\r\nmade up of thin-walled cells, which when moistened swell and give off\r\nthe mucilage. In the dry state or seen under oil, the outlines of the\r\nsingle cells of this layer are not distinguishable. The tissue of\r\nthe cotyledons is loaded with drops of fatty oil and with granular\r\nalbuminoid matter; starch which is present in the seed while young, is\r\naltogether absent when the latter reaches maturity.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—White mustard deprived of fatty oil yields to\r\nboiling alcohol colourless crystals of _Sinalbin_, an indifferent\r\nsubstance, readily soluble in cold water, but sparingly in cold\r\nalcohol. From the able investigations of Will (1870) it follows, that\r\nit is to be regarded as composed of three bodies, namely:\r\n\r\n    Sulphocyanate of Acrinyl   C⁸  H₇   N  S  O\r\n    Sulphate of Sinapine       C₁₆ H₂₅  N  S  O₉\r\n    Sugar                      C₆  H₁₂        O₆\r\n                               -----------------\r\n    so that the formula        C₃₀ H₄₄  N₂ S₂ O₁₆\r\n\r\n[296] _Journ. de Pharm._ xvii. (1831) 279.\r\n\r\n[297] An interesting object for the polarizing microscope.\r\n\r\nrepresents according to Will the composition of sinalbin. It is\r\nactually resolved into these three substances when placed at ordinary\r\ntemperatures, in contact with water and _Myrosin_, the latter of\r\nwhich is a constituent of white mustard as well as of brown (p. 66).\r\nThe liquid becomes turbid, the first of the above-named substances\r\nseparates (together with coagulated albumin) as an oily liquid,\r\nnot soluble in water, but dissolving in alcohol or ether. This\r\n_Sulphocyanate of Acrinyl_ is the rubefacient and vesicating principle\r\nof white mustard. It does not pre-exist, as shown by Will, in the\r\nseed, and cannot be obtained by distillation. By treating it with a\r\nsalt of silver, Will obtained crystals of cyanide of acrinyl, C₈H₇NO:\r\nby warming it (or sinalbin itself, or an alcoholic extract of the\r\nseed) with caustic potash, sulphocyanide of potassium is produced. The\r\npresence of the latter may be indicated by adding a drop of perchloride\r\nof iron, when a blood-red coloration will be produced.[298]\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Sinapine_ imparts to the emulsion of white mustard, in\r\nwhich it is formed, an acid reaction. Sinapine is itself an alkaloid,\r\nwhich has not yet been isolated, as it is very liable to change. Thus\r\nits solution on addition of a trace of alkali immediately assumes a\r\nbright yellow colour indicating decomposition, and a similar colour is\r\nproduced in an aqueous extract of the seed.\r\n\r\nThe above statements show, that the chemical properties of sinalbin\r\nand its derivatives correspond closely with those of sinigrin (p. 66)\r\nand the substances which make their appearance in an emulsion of black\r\nmustard.\r\n\r\nThe other constituents of white mustard seed are nearly the same as\r\nthose of black. The fat oil appears to yield in addition to the acids\r\nmentioned at p. 67, _Benic_ or _Behenic Acid_, C₂₂H₄₄O₂. White mustard\r\nis said to be richer than black in myrosin, so that, as explained in\r\nthe previous article, the pungency of the latter may be often increased\r\nby an addition of white mustard. By burning white mustard dried at\r\n100° C., with soda-lime, we obtained from 4·20 to 4·30 per cent. of\r\nnitrogen, answering to about 28 per cent. of protein substances.[299]\r\nThe fixed oil of the seed amounts to 22 per cent. The mucilage as\r\nyielded by the epidermis is precipitable by alcohol, neutral lead\r\nacetate, or ferric chloride, and is soluble in water after drying.\r\n\r\n_Erucin_ and _Sinapic Acid_, mentioned by Simon (1838)[300] as\r\npeculiar constituents of white mustard, are altogether doubtful, yet\r\nmay deserve further investigation. The sinapic acid of Von Babo and\r\nHirschbrunn[301] (1852) is a product of the decomposition of sinapine.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—White Mustard seed reduced to powder and made into a paste\r\nwith cold water act as a powerful stimulant when applied to the skin,\r\nnotwithstanding that such paste is entirely wanting in essential oil.\r\nBut for sinapisms they are actually used only in the form of the _Flour\r\nof Mustard_ which is prepared for the table and which contains also\r\nBrown Mustard seed.\r\n\r\n[298] The red compound thus formed with sulphocyanide is readily\r\nsoluble in ether, yet in the case of white mustard we find it _not_ to\r\nbe so.\r\n\r\n[299] Experiments performed by Mr. Weppen in my laboratory, 1869.—F.

In Britain and in other parts of Europe from Sicily to the\r\npolar circle, it occurs cultivated or semi-wild; in the opinion of\r\nSchübeler[302] it is not truly indigenous to Norway.\r\n\r\n=History=—The vernacular name _Armon_ is stated by Pliny[303] to be\r\nused in the Pontic regions to designate the _Armoracia_ of the Romans,\r\nthe Wild Radish (ῤαϕανὶς ἀγρία) of the Greeks, a plant which cannot be\r\npositively identified with that under notice.\r\n\r\nHorse-radish is called in the Russian language _Chren_, in Lithuanian\r\n_Krenai_, in Illyrian _Kren_, a name which has passed into several\r\nGerman dialects, and as _Cran_ or _Cranson_ into French.\r\n\r\nFrom these and similar facts, De Candolle[304] has drawn the conclusion\r\nthat the propagation of the plant has travelled from Eastern to Western\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nBoth the root and leaves of horse-radish were used as a medicine\r\nand also eaten with food in Germany and Denmark during the middle\r\nages.[305] But the use of the former was not common in England until\r\na much later period. The plant is mentioned in the _Meddygon Myddfai_\r\nand was known in England as _Red-cole_ in the time of Turner, 1568,\r\nbut is not quoted by him[306] as used in food, nor is it noticed by\r\nBoorde,[307] 1542, in his chapter on edible roots. Gerarde[308] at the\r\nend of the 16th century remarks that horse-radish—“is commonly used\r\namong the Germans for sauce to eat fish with, and such like meats, as\r\nwe do mustard.” Half a century later the taste for horse-radish had\r\nbegun to prevail in England. Coles[309] (1657) states that the root\r\nsliced thin and mixed with vinegar is eaten as a sauce with meat as\r\namong the Germans. That the use of horse-radish in France had the same\r\norigin is proved by its old French name _Moutarde des Allemands_.\r\n\r\nThe root to which certain medicinal properties had always been\r\nassigned, was included in the materia medica of the London\r\nPharmacopœias of the last century under the name of _Raphanus\r\nrusticanus_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The root which in good ground often attains a length\r\nof 3 feet and nearly an inch in diameter, is enlarged in its upper\r\npart into a crown, usually dividing into a few short branches each\r\nsurmounted by a tuft of leaves, and annulated by the scars of fallen\r\nfoliage; below the crown it tapers slightly, and then for some distance\r\nis often almost cylindrical, throwing off here and there filiform\r\nand long slender cylindrical roots, and finally dividing into two or\r\nthree branches. The root is of a light yellowish-brown; internally it\r\nis fleshy and perfectly white, and has a short non-fibrous fracture.\r\nBefore it is broken it is inodorous, but when comminuted it immediately\r\nexhales its characteristic pungent smell. Its well-known pungent taste\r\nis not lost in the root carefully dried and not kept too long.\r\n\r\n[302] _Pflanzenwelt Norwegens_ (1873) 296.\r\n\r\n[303] Lib. xix. c. 26 (Littré’s translation).\r\n\r\n[304] _Géographie Botanique_, ii.

In the root branches there is neither a well-defined\r\nliber nor a true pith. The short leaf-bearing branches include a large\r\npith surrounded by a circle of woody bundles. The bark adheres strongly\r\nto the central portion, in which zones of annual growth are easily\r\nperceptible, at least in older specimens.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The corky layer is made up of small tabular\r\ncells as usual in suberous coats. In the succeeding zone of the\r\nmiddle bark, thick-walled yellow cells are scattered through the\r\nparenchyme, chiefly at the boundary line of the corky layer. In the\r\nroot the cellular envelope is not strikingly separated from the\r\nliber, whilst in its leafy branches this separation is well marked by\r\nwedge-shaped liber bundles, which are accompanied by a group of the\r\nyellow longitudinally-elongated stone-cells. The woody bundles contain\r\na few short yellow vessels, accompanied by bundles of prosenchymatous,\r\nnot properly woody cells. The centre, in the root, shows these woody\r\nbundles to be separated by the medullary parenchyma; in the branches\r\nthe central column consists of an uniform pith without woody bundles,\r\nthe latter forming a circle close to the cambium. The parenchyma of the\r\nwhole root collected in spring is loaded with small starch granules.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Among the constituents of horse-radish root (the\r\nchemical history of which is however far from perfect) the volatile\r\noil is the most interesting. The fresh root submitted to distillation\r\nwith water in a glass retort, yields about ½ per mille of oil which is\r\nidentical with that of Black Mustard as proved in 1843 by Hubatka. He\r\ncombined it with ammonia and obtained crystals of thiosinammine, the\r\ncomposition of which agreed with the thiosinammine from mustard oil.\r\n\r\nAn alcoholic extract of the root is devoid of the odour of the oil, but\r\nthis is quickly evolved on addition of an emulsion of _White_ Mustard.\r\nThe essential oil does not therefore pre-exist, but only sinigrin\r\n(myronate of potassium) and an albuminoid matter (myrosin) by whose\r\nmutual reaction in the presence of water it is formed (p. 66). This\r\nprocess does not go on in the growing root, perhaps because the two\r\nprinciples in question are not contained in the same cells, or else\r\nexist together in some condition that does not allow of their acting on\r\neach other,—a state of things analogous to that occurring in the leaves\r\nof _Lauro-cerasus_.\r\n\r\nBy exhausting the root with water either cold or hot, the sinigrin is\r\ndecomposed and a considerable proportion of bisulphate is found in the\r\nconcentrated decoction. Alcohol removes from the root some fatty matter\r\nand sugar (Winckler 1849). Salts of iron do not alter thin slices of\r\nit, tannic matters being absent. The presence of myrosin, which at\r\npresent has been inferred rather than proved, ought to be further\r\ninvestigated. The root dried at 100° C afforded 11·15 per cent. of ash\r\nto Mutschler (1878).\r\n\r\n=Uses=—An infusion or a distilled spirit of horse-radish is reputed\r\nstimulant, diaphoretic, and diuretic, but is not often employed.\r\n\r\n=Substitute=—In India the root of _Moringa pterygosperma_ Gärtn. is\r\nconsidered a substitute for horse-radish. It yields by distillation an\r\nessential oil of disgusting odour which Broughton, who obtained it in\r\nminute quantity, has assured us is not identical with that of mustard\r\nor of garlic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANELLACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTEX CANELLÆ ALBÆ.\r\n\r\n_Canella Bark_, _Canella Alba Bark_; F. _Canelle blanche_; G.\r\n_Canella-Rinde_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Canella alba_ Murray,[310] a tree, 20 to 30 or\r\neven 50 feet in height, found in the south of Florida, the Bahama\r\nIslands (whence alone its bark is exported), Cuba, Jamaica, Ste. Broix,\r\nGuadaloupe, Martinique, Barbadoes and Trinidad.\r\n\r\n=History=—The drug was first mentioned in 1605 by Clusius,[311] who\r\nremarks that it had been then newly brought to Europe and had received\r\nthe name of _Canella alba_ (White Cinnamon). It was afterwards known\r\nas _Costus Corticosus_, _Costus dulcis_, _Cassia alba_, _Cassia lignea\r\nJamaicensis_ or _Jamaica Winter’s Bark_. Dale[312] writing in 1693\r\nnotices it as not unfrequently sold for Winter’s Bark. Pomet[313]\r\n(1694) describes it as synonymous with Winter’s Bark, and observes that\r\nit is common, yet but little employed.\r\n\r\nThe drug is mentioned by most subsequent writers, some of whom like\r\nPomet probably confounded it with the bark of _Cinnamodendron_ (p.\r\n19). It is usually described as produced in Jamaica or Guadaloupe,\r\nfrom which islands no Canella alba is now exported. On the other hand,\r\nNew Providence, one of the Bahamas whence the Canella alba of the\r\npresent day is shipped, is not named. Nor do we find any allusion to\r\nthe drug in the records of the Company (1630-50) which was formed for\r\nthe colonization of New Providence and the other islands of the group,\r\nthough their staple productions are frequently enumerated.[314]\r\n\r\n_Canella alba_ Murr. was described and figured by Sloane (1707) and\r\nstill better by Patrick Brown in 1789, and Olaf Swartz in 1791.[315]\r\n\r\n[310] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Medic. Plants_, part 6 (1876).\r\n\r\n[311] _Exotica_, 78.\r\n\r\n[312] _Pharmacologia_, 432.\r\n\r\n[313] _Hist. des Drog._ part i. 130.\r\n\r\n[314] _Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series_, 1584-1660, Lond.\r\n1860.\r\n\r\n[315] O. Swartz, Trans. of the Linnean Soc., i. 96. See also Bonnet,\r\n_Monographie des Canellées_, 1876.\r\n\r\n=Collection=—In the Bahamas, where the drug is known as _White-Wood\r\nBark_ or _Cinnamon Bark_, it is collected thus:—preparatory to being\r\nstripped from the wood, the bark is gently beaten with a stick, which\r\nremoves the suberous layer. By a further beating, the remaining bark is\r\nseparated, and having been peeled off and dried, is exported without\r\nfurther preparation.[316]\r\n\r\n=Description=—Canella bark occurs in the form of quills, more or less\r\ncrooked and irregular, or in channelled pieces from 2 or 3 up to 6,\r\n8, or more inches in length, ½ an inch to 1 or 2 inches in width, and\r\na line or two in thickness. The suberous layer which here and there\r\nhas escaped removal is silvery grey, and dotted with minute lichens.\r\nCommonly, the external surface consists of inner cellular layers\r\n(_mesophlœum_) of a bright buff, or light orange-brown tint, often a\r\nlittle wrinkled transversely, and dotted (but not always) with round\r\nscars. The inner surface is whitish or cinnamon-coloured, either smooth\r\nor with slight longitudinal striæ. Some parcels of canella show the\r\nbark much bruised and longitudinally fissured by the above-mentioned\r\nprocess of beating. The bark breaks transversely with a short granular\r\nfracture, which distinctly shows the three, or in uncoated specimens\r\nthe two, cortical layers, that of the liber being the largest, and\r\nprojecting by undulated rays or bundles into the middle layer, which\r\npresents numerous large and unevenly scattered oil-cells of a yellow\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nCanella has an agreeable cinnamon-like odour, and a bitter, pungent\r\nacrid taste.[317] Even the corky coat is somewhat aromatic.\r\n\r\n=Microscopical Structure=—The spongy suberous coat consists of very\r\nnumerous layers of large cells with thin walls, showing an undulated\r\nrather than rectangular outline. The next small zone is constituted\r\nof sclerenchymatous cells in a single, double, or triple row, or\r\nforming dense but not very extensive groups. This tissue is sometimes\r\n(in unpeeled specimens) a continuous envelope, marking the boundary\r\nbetween the corky layer and the middle portion of the cellular layer;\r\nbut an interruption in this thick-walled tissue often takes place when\r\nportions of it are enveloped and separated by the suberous layer.\r\n\r\nThe proper cellular envelope shows a narrow tissue with numerous very\r\nlarge cells filled with yellow essential oil. The liber forming the\r\nchief portion of the whole bark, exhibits thin prosenchymatous cells,\r\nwhich on traverse section form small bands of a peculiar horny or\r\ncartilaginous appearance, on which account they have been distinguished\r\nas _horny liber_ (_Hornbast_ of German writers).[318] The liber-fibres\r\nshow reticulated marks due to the peculiar character of the secondary\r\ndeposits on their cell-walls. The oil-cells in the liber are less\r\nnumerous and smaller; the medullary rays are not very obvious unless\r\non account of the crystalline tufts of oxalate of calcium deposited in\r\nthe latter. This crystalline oxalate retains air obstinately, and has a\r\nstriking dark appearance.\r\n\r\n[316] Information communicated to me by the Hon. J. C. Lees,\r\nChief-Justice of the Bahamas. The second beating would seem to be not\r\nalways required.—D. H.\r\n\r\n[317] A specimen in Sloane’s collection in the British Museum labelled\r\n“_Cortex Winteranus of the Isles_,” but under the microscope seen to\r\nbe absolutely identical with canella alba, still retains its proper\r\nfragrance after nearly two centuries.—F. A. F.\r\n\r\n[318] First figured and described by Oudemaus, —_Aanteekeningen op het\r\n... Gedeelte der Pharm. Neerlandica_, 1854-56. 467.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most interesting body in canella is the\r\nvolatile oil, examined in 1843 under Wöhler’s direction by Meyer and\r\nvon Reiche, who obtained it in the proportion of 0·94 from 100 parts of\r\nbark. They found it to consist of four different oils, the first being\r\nidentical with the _Eugenol_ or _Eugenic Acid_ of oil of cloves; the\r\nsecond is closely allied to the chief constituent of cajuput oil. The\r\nother oils require further examination.[319]\r\n\r\nThe bark, of which we distilled 20 lb., afforded 0·74 per cent. of\r\noil. This when distilled with caustic potash in excess was found to\r\nbe composed of 2 parts of the acid portion and 1 part of the neutral\r\nhydrocarbon; the latter has an odour suggesting a mixture of peppermint\r\nand cajuput.\r\n\r\nMeyer and von Reiche evaporated the aqueous decoction of canella, and\r\nremoved from the bitter extract by alcohol 8 per cent. of mannite,\r\nwhich they ascertained to be the so-called _Canellin_ described in 1822\r\nby Petroz and Robinet.\r\n\r\nThe bark yielded the German chemists 6 per cent. of ash, chiefly\r\ncarbonate of calcium. The bitter principle has not yet been isolated.\r\nAn aqueous infusion is not blackened by a persalt of iron.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Canella alba is collected in the Bahama Islands and shipped\r\nto Europe from Nassau in New Providence, the chief seat of trade in the\r\ngroup. In 1876 the export of the bark amounted to 125 cwt.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The bark is an aromatic stimulant, now but seldom employed. It\r\nis used by the West Indian negroes as a condiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIXINEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEN GYNOCARDIÆ.\r\n\r\n_Chaulmugra Seed._\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Gynocardia odorata_ R. Br. (_Chaulmoogra_ Roxb.,\r\n_Hydnocarpus_ Lindl.), a large tree[320] with a globular fruit of the\r\nsize of a shaddock, containing numerous seeds immersed in pulp. It\r\ngrows in the forests of the Malayan peninsula and Eastern India as\r\nfar north as Assam, extending thence along the base of the Himalaya\r\nwestward to Sikkim.\r\n\r\n=History=—The inhabitants of the south-eastern countries of Asia have\r\nlong been acquainted with the seeds of certain trees of the tribe\r\n_Pangieæ_ (ord. _Bixineæ_) as a remedy for maladies of the skin. In\r\nChina a seed called _Ta-fung-tsze_ is imported from Siam[321] where it\r\nis known as _Lukrabo_ and used in a variety of cutaneous complaints.\r\nThe tree affording it, which is figured in the _Pun-tasao_ (_circa_\r\nA.D. 1596) has not been recognised by botanists, but from the structure\r\nof the seed it is obviously closely related to _Gynocardia_.[322]\r\n\r\n[319] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, xiv. (1860) 210.\r\n\r\n[320] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Medic. Plants_, part. 26 (1877).\r\nAlso in Christy, _New Commercial Plants_, No. 2 (1878).\r\n\r\n[321] The _Commercial Report from H. M. Consul-General in Siam for the\r\nyear 1871_, presented to Parliament, Aug. 1872, states that 48 peculs\r\n(6400 lb.) of _Lukrabow seeds_ were exported from Bangkok to China in\r\n1871. Sir Joseph Hooker (_Report on the Royal Gardens at Kew_, 1877,\r\np. 33) has been informed by Mr. Pierre, the director of the Botanic\r\nGarden at Saigon, Cochin China, that the seeds have proved to derive\r\nfrom a Hydnocarpus (Gynocardia).—See also our article Semen Ignatii and\r\n_Science Papers_, p. 235.\r\n\r\n[322] Hanbury, _Notes on Chinese Mat. Med._ (1862) 23.—_Science\r\nPapers_, 244. Dr. Porter Smith assumes the Chinese drug to be derived\r\nfrom _G. odorata_, but as I have pointed out, the seeds have a much\r\nstronger testa than those of that tree.—D. H.\r\n\r\nThe properties of _G. odorata_ were known to Roxburgh who, Latinizing\r\nthe Indian name of the tree, called it (1814) _Chaulmoogra odorata_. Of\r\nlate years the seeds have attracted the notice of Europeans in India,\r\nand having been found useful in certain skin diseases, they have been\r\nadmitted a place in the _Pharmacopœia of India_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The seeds, 1 to 1¼ inches long and about half as much\r\nin diameter, are of irregular ovoid form, and more or less angular or\r\nflattened by mutual pressure; they weigh on an average about 35 grains\r\neach. The testa is thin (about ¹/₅₀ of an inch), brittle, smooth, dull\r\ngrey; within there is a brown oily kernel, marked with a darker colour\r\nat its basal end. The weight of the kernel is, on an average, twice\r\nthat of the testa. The former encloses in its copious, soft albumen\r\na pair of large, plain, leafy, heart-shaped cotyledons with a stout\r\nradicle. The taste of the kernel is simply oily.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The testa is chiefly formed of cylindrical\r\nthick-walled cells. The albumen exhibits large angular cells containing\r\nfatty oil, masses of albuminous matter and tufted crystals of calcium\r\noxalate. Starch is not present.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The kernels afforded us by means of ether 51·5\r\nper cent. of fatty oil, which is almost colourless or somewhat brownish\r\nif the seeds are not fresh. Either extracted or expressed it is of no\r\npeculiar taste. The pressed oil concretes at 17° C.; that extracted\r\nby ether or bisulphide of carbon requires for solidification a lower\r\ntemperature. The expressed oil is slightly fluorescent, less so that\r\nextracted by means of bisulphide of carbon. If the oil, either pressed\r\nor extracted, is diluted with the bisulphide, and then concentrated\r\nsulphuric or nitric acid is added, no peculiar coloration is produced.\r\n\r\nFrom the powdered kernels deprived of oil, water removes the usual\r\nconstituents, glucose, mucilage and albumin.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The seeds are said to have been advantageously used as an\r\nalternative tonic in scrofula, skin diseases and rheumatism. They\r\nshould be freed from the testa, powdered, and given in the dose of 6\r\ngrains gradually increased. Reduced to a paste and mixed with Simple\r\nOintment, they constitute the _Unguentum Gynocardiæ_ of the _Indian\r\nPharmacopœia_, which, as well as an expressed oil of the seeds may be\r\nemployed externally in herpes, tinea, &c.[323]\r\n\r\n[323] For particulars see Christy’s pamphlet alluded to above, p. 75.\r\n\r\n=Substitute=—It has been suggested that the seeds of _Hydnocarpus\r\nWightiana_ Bl., a tree of Western India, and of _H. venenata_ Gärtn.,\r\nnative of Ceylon, might be tried where those of _Gynocardia_ are not\r\nprocurable. The seeds of both species of _Hydnocarpus_ (formerly\r\nconfounded together as _H. inebrians_ Vahl) afford a fatty oil which\r\nthe natives use in cutaneous diseases.[324]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYGALEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX SENEGÆ.\r\n\r\n_Radix Senekæ_; _Senega or Seneka Root_; F. _Racine de Polygala de\r\nVirginie_; G. _Senegawurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Polygala Senega_ L., a perennial plant with slender\r\nascending stems 6 to 12 inches high, and spikes of dull white flowers\r\nresembling in form those of the Common Milkwort of Britain. It is found\r\nin British America as far north as the river Saskatchewan, and in the\r\nUnited States from New England to Wisconsin, Kentucky, Tennessee,\r\nVirginia and the upper parts of North Carolina, as well as in Georgia\r\nand Texas, not in the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe plant, which frequents rocky open woods and plains, has become\r\nsomewhat scarce in the Atlantic states, and as a drug is now chiefly\r\ncollected in the west, the plant growing profusely in Iowa and\r\nMinnesota, west of New York.\r\n\r\n=History=—The employment of this root among the Seneca Indians as a\r\nremedy for the bite of the rattlesnake attracted the notice of Tennent,\r\na Scotch physician in Virginia; and from the good effects he witnessed\r\nhe concluded that it might be administered with advantage in pleurisy\r\nand peripneumonia. The result of numerous trials made in the years\r\n1734 and 1735 proved the utility of the drug in these complaints, and\r\nTennent communicated his observations to the celebrated Dr. Mead of\r\nLondon in the form of an epistle, afterwards published together with an\r\nengraving of the plant, then called the _Seneca Rattlesnake Root_.[325]\r\nTennent’s practice was to administer the root in powder or as a strong\r\ndecoction, or more often infused in wine. The new drug was favourably\r\nreceived in Europe, and its virtues discussed in numerous theses and\r\ndissertations, one written in 1749 being by Linnæus.[326]\r\n\r\n=Description=—Senega root is developed at its upper end into a knotty\r\ncrown, in old roots as much as an inch in diameter, from which\r\nspring the numerous wiry aerial stems, beset at the base with scaly\r\nrudimentary leaves often of a purplish hue. Below the crown is a simple\r\ntap-root ²/₁₀ to ³/₁₀ of an inch thick, of contorted or somewhat spiral\r\nform, which usually soon divides into 2 or 3 spreading branches and\r\nsmaller filiform rootlets.\r\n\r\n[324] Waring, _Pharm. of India_, 1868. 27.\r\n\r\n[325] Tennent (John), _Epistle to Dr. Richard Mead concerning the\r\nepidemical diseases of Virginia_, &c., Edinb. 1738.\r\n\r\n[326] _Amœnitates Academicæ_, ii. 126.\r\n\r\nThe bark is light yellowish-grey, translucent, horny, shrivelled,\r\nknotted and partially annulated. Very frequently a keel-shaped ridge\r\noccurs, running like a shrunken sinew through the principal root;\r\nit has no connexion with the wood, but originates in a one-sided\r\ndevelopment of the liber-tissue. The bark encloses a pure, white woody\r\ncolumn about as thick as itself. After the root has been macerated in\r\nwater the bark is easily peeled off, and the peculiar structure of\r\nthe wood can then be studied. The latter immediately below the crown\r\nis a cylindrical cord, cleft however by numerous, fine, longitudinal\r\nfissures. Lower down these fissures increase in an irregular manner,\r\ncausing a very abnormal development of the wood. Transverse sections\r\nof a root therefore differ greatly, the circular wood portion being\r\neither penetrated by clefts or wide notches, or one-half or even more\r\nis altogether wanting, the space where wood should exist being in each\r\ncase filled up by uniform parenchymatous tissue.\r\n\r\nSenega root has a short brittle fracture, a peculiar rancid odour, and\r\na very acrid and sourish taste. When handled it disperses in irritating\r\ndust.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The woody part is built up of dotted vessels\r\nsurrounded by short porous ligneous cells; the medullary rays consist\r\nof one or two rows of the usual small cells. There is no pith in the\r\ncentre of the root. The clefts and notches are filled up with an\r\nuniform tissue passing into the primary cortical tissue without a\r\ndistinct liber; the large cells of this tissue are spirally striated.\r\nIn the keel-shaped rider the proper liber rays may be distinguished\r\nfrom the medullary rays. The former are made up of a soft tissue, hence\r\nthe cortical part of the root breaks short together with the wood.\r\n\r\nNeither starch granules nor crystals of oxalate of calcium are present\r\nin this root; the chief contents of its tissue are albuminoid granules\r\nand drops of fatty oil.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The substance to which the drug owes its\r\nirritating taste was distinguished by the name of _Senegin_ by Gehlen\r\nas early as 1804, and is probably the same as the _Polygalic Acid_ of\r\nQuevenne (1836) and of Procter (1859). Christophsohn (1874) extracted\r\nit by means of boiling water, evaporated the solution and exhausted\r\nthe residue with boiling alcohol (0·853 sp. gr.). The liquid after a\r\nday or two, deposits the crude senegin, which is to be washed with\r\nalcohol (0·813 sp. gr.), and again dissolved in water, from which it\r\nis precipitated by a large excess of hydrate of baryum. The barytic\r\ncompound, dissolved in water, is decomposed by carbonic acid, by which\r\ncarbonate of baryum is separated, senegin remaining in solution. It\r\nis lastly to be precipitated by alcohol. It is amorphous, insoluble\r\nin ether and in cold water; it forms with boiling water a frothing\r\nsolution. Like saponin, to which it is very closely allied, it excites\r\nviolent sneezing.\r\n\r\nDilute inorganic acids added to a warm solution of senegin throw down\r\na flocculent jelly of _Sapogenin_, the liquid retaining in solution\r\nuncrystallizable sugar. Alkalis give rise to the same decomposition;\r\nbut it is difficult to split up the senegin completely, and hence the\r\nformulas given for this process are doubtful. Even the formula of\r\nsenegin itself is not definitely settled. According to Christophsohn,\r\nthe root yields about 2 per cent. of this substance; according to\r\nearlier authorities, who doubtless had it less pure, a much larger\r\nproportion. From Schneider’s investigations (1875) it would appear that\r\nthe rootlets are richest in senegin.\r\n\r\nSenega root contains a little volatile oil, traces of resin, also gum,\r\nsalts of malic acid, yellow colouring matter, and sugar (7 per cent.\r\naccording to Rebling, 1855). The _Virginic Acid_ said by Quevenne to\r\nbe contained in it, and the bitter substance _Isolusin_ mentioned by\r\nPeschier, are doubtful bodies.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Senega is prescribed as a stimulating expectorant and diuretic,\r\nuseful in pneumonia, asthma and rheumatism. It is much esteemed in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The drug is not liable to be wilfully falsified, but\r\nthrough careless collecting there is occasionally a slight admixture of\r\nother roots. One of these is American Ginseng (_Panax quinquefolium_\r\nL.) a spindle-shaped root which may be found here and there both in\r\nsenega and serpentaria. The rhizome of _Cypripedium pubescens_ Willd.\r\nhas also been noticed; it cannot be confounded with that of _Polygala\r\nSenega_. The same may be said with regard to the rhizome of _Cynanchum\r\nVincetoxicum_ R. Brown (_Asclepias_ L., _Vincetoxicum officinale_\r\nMönch).\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX KRAMERIÆ.\r\n\r\n_Radix Ratanhiæ_, _Rhatanhiæ v. Rathaniæ_; _Rhatany or Rhatania\r\nRoot, Peruvian or Payta Rhatany_; F. _Racine de Ratanhia_; G.\r\n_Ratanhiawurzel_.[327]\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Krameriæ triandra_ Ruiz et Pav., a small woody\r\nshrub with an upright stem scarcely a foot high and thick decumbent\r\nbranches 2 to 3 feet long.[328] It delights in the barren sandy\r\ndeclivities of the Bolivian and Peruvian Cordilleras at 3000 to 8000\r\nfeet above the sea-level, often occurring in great abundance and\r\nadorning the ground with its red star-like flowers and silver-grey\r\nfoliage.\r\n\r\nThe root is gathered chiefly to the north, north-east, and east of\r\nLima, as at Caxatambo, Huanuco, Tarma, Jauja, Huarochiri and Canta;\r\noccasionally on the high lands about lake Titicaca. It appears likewise\r\nto be collected in the northern part of Peru, since the drug is now\r\nfrequently shipped from Payta.\r\n\r\n=History=—Hipolito Ruiz,[329] the Spanish botanist, observed in 1784\r\nthat the women of Huanuco and Lima were in the habit of using for the\r\npreservation of their teeth a root which he recognized as that of\r\n_Krameria triandra_, a plant discovered by himself in 1779. On his\r\nreturn to Europe he obtained admission for this root into Spain in\r\n1796, whence it was gradually introduced into other countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe first supplies which reached England formed part of the cargo\r\nof a Spanish prize, and were sold in the London drug sales at the\r\ncommencement of the present century. Some fell into the hands of Dr.\r\nReece who recommended it to the profession.[330]\r\n\r\nAbout 20 years ago there appeared in the European market some other\r\nkinds of rhatany previously unknown: of these the more important are\r\nnoticed at pp. 81, 82.\r\n\r\n[327] Ruiz and Pavon state that the root is called at Huanuco\r\n_ratanhia_. The derivation of the word which is of the Quichua language\r\nis obscure.\r\n\r\n[328] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Medicinal Plants_, part 30 (1876).\r\n\r\n[329] _Mem. de la R. Acad. med. de Madrid_, i. (1797) 349—366.\r\n\r\n[330] _Medicinal and Chirurgical Review_, Lond., xiii. (1806) ccxlvi.;\r\nalso Reece, _Dict. of Domest. Med._, 1808.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The root which attains a considerable size in proportion\r\nto the aerial part of the shrub, consists of a short thick crown,\r\nsometimes much knotted and as large as a man’s fist. This ramifies\r\nbeneath the soil even more than above, throwing out an abundance of\r\nbranching, woody roots (frequently horizontal) some feet long and ¼\r\nto ½ an inch thick. These long roots used formerly to be found in\r\ncommerce; but of late years rhatany has consisted in large proportion\r\nof the more woody central part of the root with short stumpy branches,\r\nwhich from their broken and bruised appearance have evidently been\r\nextracted with difficulty from a hard soil.\r\n\r\nThe bark which is scaly and rugged, and ⅒ to ¹/₂₀ of an inch in\r\nthickness, is of a dark reddish-brown. It consists of a loose cracked\r\ncork-layer, mostly smooth in the smaller roots, covering a bright\r\nbrown-red inner bark, which adheres though not very firmly to a\r\nbrownish yellow wood. The bark is rather tough, breaking with a fibrous\r\nfracture. The wood is dense, without pith, but marked with thin vessels\r\narranged in concentric rings, and with still thinner, dark medullary\r\nrays. The taste of the bark is purely astringent; the wood is almost\r\ntasteless; neither possesses any distinctive odour.\r\n\r\n_Kr. cistoidea_ Hook, a plant scarcely to be distinguished from _Kr.\r\ntriandra_, affords in Chili a rhatany very much like that of Peru. Its\r\nroot was contributed to the Paris Exhibition of 1867.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The chief portion of the bark is formed of\r\nliber, which in transverse section exhibits numerous bundles of yellow\r\nfibres separated by parenchymatous tissue and traversed by narrow brown\r\nmedullary rays. The small layer of the primary bark is made up of large\r\ncells, the surface of the root of large suberous cells imbued with red\r\nmatter. The latter also occurs in the inner cortical tissue, and ought\r\nto be removed by means of ammonia in order to get a clear idea of the\r\nstructure. Many of the parenchymatous cells are loaded with starch\r\ngranules; oxalate of calcium occurs in the neighbourhood of the liber\r\nbundles. The woody portion exhibits no structure of particular interest.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Wittstein (1854) found in the bark of rhatany\r\n(the only part of the drug having active properties) about 20 per cent.\r\nof a form of tannin called _Ratanhia-tannic Acid_, closely related to\r\ncatechu-tannic acid. It is an amorphous powder, the solution of which\r\nis not affected by emetic tartar, but yields with ferric chloride a\r\ndark greenish precipitate. By distillation Eissfeldt (1854) obtained\r\npyrocatechin as a product of the decomposition of ratanhia-tannic acid.\r\nThe latter is also decomposed by dilute acids which convert it into\r\ncrystallizable sugar and _Ratanhia-red_, a substance nearly insoluble\r\nin water, also occurring in abundance ready formed in the bark.\r\n\r\nGrabowski (1867) showed that by fusing ratanhia-red with caustic\r\npotash, protocatechuic acid and phloroglucin[331] are obtained.\r\nRatanhia-red has the composition C₂₆H₂₂O₁₁, the same, according\r\nto Grabowski, as an analogous product of the decomposition of the\r\npeculiar tannic acid occurring (as shown by Rochleder in 1866) in\r\nthe horse-chestnut. The same red substance may also be obtained, as\r\nstated by Rembold (1868), from the tannic acid of the root of tormentil\r\n(_Potentilla Tormentilla_ L.).\r\n\r\n[331] See art. Kino.\r\n\r\nAs to rhatany root, Wittstein also found it to contain wax, gum and\r\nuncrystallizable sugar (even in the wood! according to Cotton[332]).\r\nCotton further pointed out the presence in very minute quantity of\r\nan odorous, volatile, solid body, obtainable by means of ether or\r\nbisulphide of carbon; it occurs in a somewhat more considerable amount\r\nin the other sorts of rhatany. The root contains no gallic acid.\r\n\r\nA dry extract of rhatany resembling kino used formerly to be imported\r\nfrom South America, but how and where manufactured we know not. It\r\nis however of some interest as containing a crystalline body which\r\nWittstein who discovered it (1854) regards as _Tyrosin_, C₉H₁₁O₃,\r\npreviously supposed to be exclusively of animal origin.[333] Städeler\r\nand Ruge (1862) assigned to it a slightly different composition,\r\nC₁₀H₁₃NO₃, and gave it the name of _Ratanhin_. It dissolves in hot\r\nwater which is acidulated by a little nitric acid; the solution on\r\nboiling turns red, blue, and lastly green, and becomes at the same\r\ntime fluorescent. Kreitmair (1875) extracted 0·7 per cent, of ratanhin\r\nfrom an old specimen of commercial extract of rhatany; but he did not\r\nsucceed in obtaining it from other specimens. He also showed that\r\nratanhin is _not_ a constituent of the roots of Krameria. The same\r\nsubstance has been abundantly found by Gintl (1868) in the natural\r\nexudation called _Resina d’Angelim pedra_[334] which is met with in the\r\nalburnum of _Ferreirea spectabilis_ Allem., a large Brazilian tree of\r\nthe order _Leguminosæ_ (tribe _Sophoreæ_). Peckolt, who first extracted\r\nit, named it _Angelin_; it forms colourless, neutral crystals yielding\r\ncompounds both with alkalis and acids, which have been investigated by\r\nGintl in 1869 and 1870.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Rhatany is a valuable astringent, but is not much employed in\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\n=Other sorts of Rhatany=—Of the 20 to 25 other species of _Krameria_,\r\nall of them belonging to America, several have astringent roots which\r\nhave been collected and used in the place of the rhatany of Peru. The\r\nmost important of these drugs is that known as—\r\n\r\n_=Para Rhatany=_,—so called from having been shipped from Pará in\r\nBrazil. Berg who described it in 1865 termed it _Brazilian Rhatany_,\r\nCotton in 1868, _Ratanhia des Antilles_. It is a drug nearly resembling\r\nthe following, but of a darker and less purple hue; it is also in\r\nlonger sticks which are remarkably flexible, and covered with a thick\r\nbark having numerous transverse cracks.[335] It is apparently derived\r\nfrom the _Krameria argentea_ of Martius,[336] the root of which is\r\ncollected in the dry districts of the provinces of Bahia and Minas\r\nGeraes, that plant growing throughout north-eastern Brazil. It is also\r\ncalled _Rhatany from Ceará_.\r\n\r\n[332] _Etudes sur le Genre Krameria_ (thèse), Paris, 1868. 83.\r\n\r\n[333] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, xiii.

(_Kr. Ixina_ var. β _granatensis_ Triana,\r\n_Kr. grandifolia_ Berg), a shrub 4 to 6 feet high covering large arid\r\ntracts in the valley of Jiron between Pamplona and the Magdalena in\r\nNew Granada, in which locality the collection of the root was observed\r\nby Weir in 1864.[337] According to Triana it also grows at Socorro,\r\nsouth of Jiron. The same plant is found near Santa Marta and Rio Hacha\r\nin north-eastern New Granada, in British Guiana, and in the Brazilian\r\nprovinces of Pernambuco and Goyaz.\r\n\r\nThe stem or root-crown of Savanilla rhatany is never so knotty and\r\nirregular as that of the Peruvian drug, nor are the roots so long or so\r\nthick. Separate pieces of root of sinuous form, 4 to 6 inches long and\r\n²/₁₀ to ³/₁₀ of an inch thick are most frequent. The drug is moreover\r\nwell distinguished by its dull purplish brown colour, its thick smooth\r\nbark marked with longitudinal furrows, and here and there with deep\r\ntransverse cracks, and by the bark not easily splitting off as it does\r\nin common rhatany.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical difference depends chiefly upon the more abundant\r\ndevelopment of the bark which in thickness is ⅓ to ¼ the diameter of\r\nthe wood. In Peruvian rhatany the cortical layer attains only ⅙ to ⅛ of\r\nthe diameter of the woody column. The greater firmness of the suberous\r\ncoat in Savanilla rhatany is due to its cells being densely filled with\r\ncolouring matter.\r\n\r\nSavanilla rhatany differs from the Peruvian root in its tannic matter.\r\nThis becomes evident by shaking the powdered root (or bark) with water\r\nand iron reduced by hydrogen. The liquid filtered from the Savanilla\r\nsort and diluted with distilled water exhibits an intense violet\r\ncolour, that from Peruvian rhatany a dingy brown; the latter turns\r\nlight red by alkalis. Thin sections of the Peruvian root assume a\r\ngreyish hue when moistened with a ferrous salt; Savanilla root by a\r\nsimilar treatment displays the above violet colour. The Savanilla root\r\nis richer in soluble matter and from the greater development of its\r\nbark may deserve to be preferred for medicinal use.\r\n\r\nIn the English market, Savanilla root is of less frequent occurrence\r\nthan that of Pará.\r\n\r\nA kind of rhatany attributed to _Krameria secundiflora_ DC., a\r\nherbaceous plant of Mexico, Texas and Arkansas, was furnished to Berg\r\nin 1854, but has not been in commerce. Its anatomical structure has\r\nbeen described by Berg.[338]\r\n\r\n[337] Hanbury, _Origin of Savanilla Rhatany_, in _Pharm.

It was introduced about thirty years\r\nago into Singapore where several specimens are still thriving (1873) on\r\nthe estate of Dr. Jamie. The finest is now a tree of 20 feet high, with\r\na trunk a foot in diameter, and a thick, spreading head of foliage.\r\n\r\n_G. Morella_ Desr.—The typical form of this tree having _sessile_ male\r\nflowers grows in moist forests of Southern India and Ceylon, and is\r\ncapable of affording good gamboge.\r\n\r\n_G. pictoria_ Roxb., a large tree of Southern India, produces a sort of\r\ngamboge found by Christian (1846) essentially the same as that of Siam.\r\nIt has been examined more recently by Broughton (1871) who states it\r\nto be quite equal to that of _G. Morella_. We have also been unable to\r\nfind any difference between the product of _G. pictoria_ as sent from\r\nCeylon and common gamboge. _Garcinia pictoria_ moreover is thought by\r\nSir Jos. Hooker to agree with _G. Morella_.\r\n\r\n=History=—The Chinese had intercourse with Camboja as early as the\r\ntime of the Sung dynasty (A.D. 970-1127); and a Chinese traveller\r\nwho visited the latter country in 1295-97, describes gamboge and the\r\nmethod of obtaining it by incisions in the stem of the tree.[340] The\r\ncelebrated Chinese herbal _Pun-tsao_, written towards the close of the\r\n16th century, mentions gamboge (_Tang-hwang_) and gives a rude figure\r\nof the tree. The drug is regarded by the Chinese as poisonous, and is\r\nscarcely employed except as a pigment.\r\n\r\nThe first notice of the occurrence of gamboge in Europe is in the\r\nwritings of Clusius[341] who describes a specimen brought from China\r\nby the Dutch Admiral, Jacob van Neck, and given to him in 1603, under\r\nthe name of _Ghittaiemou_.[342] It appears that shortly after this\r\ntime it began to be employed in medicine in Europe, for in 1611,\r\nMichael Reuden, a physician of Bamberg, made use of it as he stated in\r\n1613.[343] He termed the drug a “novum gummi purgans,” or also, Gummi\r\nde Peru, the latter strange name no doubt being a corruption of the\r\nabove mentioned Ghittaiemou. The appellation “gummi de Peru” is met\r\nwith in pharmaceutical tariffs during the 17th and 18th centuries.\r\n\r\n[339] It has been named _Garcinia Hanburyi_ by Sir Joseph Hooker\r\n(_Journ. of the Linnean Soc._ xiv., 1873, 435), but I presume my\r\nlamented friend Daniel Hanbury would not have considered the plant\r\nunder notice as a distinct species.

Rost is of opinion that this word is derived from the\r\nMalay _gătáh_, gum, and the Javanese _jamú_ signifying medicinal, such\r\nmixing of the two languages being of common occurrence.\r\n\r\n[343] _De nova gummi purgante_, Lipsiæ, 1614. We have only seen the\r\nsecond edition published at Leiden in 1625, its preface dating from\r\n1613.\r\n\r\nGamboge is one of the articles of the tariff of the pharmaceutical\r\nshops of the City of Frankfort in 1612: “Gutta gemou, a strong\r\npurgative dried juice, coming from the Kingdom of _Patana_ in the\r\nEast Indies.” Patana or Patani is the most populous province of the\r\neast coast of the peninsula of Malacca. The Dutch established there\r\na factory in 1602, and were followed in 1612 by the English. The\r\nsettlement was abandoned in 1700; gamboge was probably brought there\r\nfrom the opposite shore of the gulf of Siam.[344]\r\n\r\nIn 1615, a considerable quantity of gamboge was offered for sale in\r\nLondon by the East Indian Company. The entry respecting it in the Court\r\nMinute Books of the company under date October 13, 1615, is to this\r\neffect:—Three chests, one rundlet, and a basket, containing 13, 14,\r\nor 15 hundredweights, more or less, of _Cambogium_ “_a drugge unknown\r\nhere_,”—the use of which, was much commended as a “_a gentle purge_,”\r\nwere offered for sale at 5s. per lb., but met with no purchaser.\r\n\r\nJacob Bontius,[345] a Dutch physician, resident, towards 1629, in\r\nBatavia, stated that “gutta Cambodja,” as he termed the drug, came from\r\nthe country of the same name; he supposed it to be derived from an\r\nEuphorbiaceous plant.\r\n\r\nParkinson,[346] who was an apothecary of London and wrote in 1640,\r\nspeaks of this “_Cambugio_,” called by some _Catharticum aureum_, as a\r\ndrug of recent importation which arrived in the form of “_wreathes or\r\nroules_” yellow within and without.\r\n\r\nIn the _London Pharmacopœia_ of 1650, gamboge is called _Gutta\r\nGamba_[347] or _Ghitta jemou_.\r\n\r\nThe mother plant of the drug was not fully examined and figured until\r\n1864; yet in 1677 already, Hermann, a German physician residing in\r\nCeylon, had pointed out that it was a Garcinia.[348]\r\n\r\n=Secretion=—We have examined a portion of a branch two inches in\r\ndiameter of the gamboge-tree,[349] and have found the yellow gum-resin\r\nto be contained chiefly in the middle layer of the bark in numerous\r\nducts like those occurring in the roots of _Inula Helenium_ and other\r\nroots of the same natural order. A little is also secreted in the\r\ndotted vessels of the outermost layer of the wood, and in the pith. The\r\nwood, which is white, acquires a bright yellow tint when exposed to the\r\nvapour of ammonia or to alkaline solutions.\r\n\r\n=Production=—At the commencement of the rainy season the\r\ngamboge-collectors start for the forest in search of the trees which\r\nin some localities are plentiful. Having found one of the full size\r\nthey make a spiral incision in the bark round half the circumference of\r\nthe trunk, and place a joint of bamboo to receive the sap which slowly\r\nexudes for several months. When it first issues from the tree, it is\r\na yellowish fluid, which after passing through a viscid state hardens\r\ninto the gamboge of commerce.\r\n\r\n[344] Flückiger, _Documente zur Geschichte der Pharmacie_, 1876. 41.\r\n\r\n[345] _De Medicina Indorum_, lib. iv.

It is still applied to gamboge.\r\n\r\n[348] Hanbury in _Trans. of Linn. Soc._ xxiv.

The tree appears to suffer\r\nno injury provided the tapping is not more frequent than every other\r\nyear.[350]\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Jamie of Singapore, the gamboge-tree grows most\r\nluxuriantly in the dense jungles. The best time for collecting is from\r\nFebruary to March or April. The trees, the larger the better, are\r\nwounded by a parang or chopping-knife, in various parts of the trunk\r\nand large branches, when prepared bamboos are inserted between the\r\nroot and the bark of the trees. The bamboo cylinders being tied or\r\ninserted, are examined daily till filled, which generally takes from 15\r\nto 30 days. Then the bamboos are taken to a fire, over which they are\r\ngradually rotated till the water in the gum-resin is evaporated and it\r\ngets sufficiently hard to allow of the bamboo being torn off.[351]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The drug arrives in the form of sticks or cylinders 1 to\r\n2½ inches in diameter, and 4 to 8 inches in length, striated lengthwise\r\nwith impressions from the inside of the bamboo. Often the sticks are\r\nagglutinated, or folded, or the drug is in compressed or in shapeless\r\nmasses. It is when good of a rich brownish orange tint, dense and\r\nhomogeneous, breaking easily with a conchoidal fracture, scarcely\r\ntranslucent even in thin splinters. Touched with water it instantly\r\nforms a yellow emulsion. Triturated in a mortar it affords a brilliant\r\nyellow powder, slightly odorous. Gamboge has a disagreeable acrid taste.\r\n\r\nMuch of the gamboge shipped to Europe is of inferior quality, being\r\nof a brownish hue or exhibiting when broken a rough, granular, bubbly\r\nsurface. Sometimes it arrives imperfectly dried and still soft.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Gamboge consists of a mixture of resin with\r\n15 to 20 per cent. of gum. The resin dissolves easily in alcohol,\r\nforming a clear liquid of fine yellowish-red hue, and not decidedly\r\nacid reaction. It forms darker-coloured solutions with ammonia or the\r\nfixed alkalis, and a copious precipitate with basic acetate of lead.\r\nPerchloride of iron colours a solution of the resin deep blackish brown.\r\n\r\nBy fusing purified gamboge resin with potash, Hlasiwetz and Barth\r\n(1866) obtained acetic acid and other acids of the same series,\r\ntogether with _phloroglucin_, C₆H₃(OH)₃, _pyrotartaric_ acid, C₅H₈O₄,\r\nand _isuvitinic_ acid, C₆H₃CH₃(COOH)₂.\r\n\r\nThe gum which we obtained to the extent of 15·8 per cent. by completely\r\nexhausting gamboge with alcohol and ether, was found readily soluble in\r\nwater. The solution does not redden litmus, and is not precipitated by\r\nneutral acetate of lead, nor by perchloride of iron, nor by silicate or\r\nbiborate of sodium. It is therefore not identical with gum arabic.\r\n\r\n[350] Spenser St. John, _Life in the Forests of the Far East_, Lond.\r\n1862. ii. 272.\r\n\r\n[351] _Pharm. Journ._ iv. (1874) 803.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The drug finds its way to Europe from Camboja by Singapore,\r\nBangkok, or Saigon. In 1877 the first place exported 240 peculs,\r\nBangkok in 1875 no less than 346 peculs, value 48,835 dollars; from\r\nSaigon there have of late been shipped from 30 to 40 peculs annually\r\n(one pecul = 133·3 lbs. = 60·479 kilogrammes).[352]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Gamboge is a drastic purgative, seldom administered except in\r\ncombination with other substances.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The Cambojans adulterate gamboge with rice flour, sand,\r\nor the pulverized bark of the tree,[353] which substances may be easily\r\ndetected in the residue left after exhausting the drug successively by\r\nspirit of wine and cold water.\r\n\r\n=Other Sources of Gamboge=—Although the gamboge of European commerce\r\nappears to be exclusively derived from the form of the plant named at\r\nthe head of this article, _Garcinia travancorica_ Beddome, is capable\r\nof yielding a similar drug which may be collected to some small extent\r\nfor local use, but not for exportation. It is a beautiful tree of the\r\nsouthern forests of Travancore and the Tinnevelly Ghats (3,000 to 4,500\r\nfeet). According to its discoverer Lieut. Beddome,[354] it yields an\r\nabundance of bright yellow gamboge.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLEUM GARCINIÆ.\r\n\r\n_Concrete Oil of Mangosteen_, _Kokum Butter_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin.=—_Garcinia indica_ Choisy (_G. purpurea_ Roxb.\r\n_Brindonia indica_ Dup. Th.), an elegant tree with drooping branches\r\nand dark green leaves.[355] It bears a smooth round fruit the size of a\r\nsmall apple, containing an acid purple pulp in which are lodged as many\r\nas 8 seeds. The tree is a native of the coast region of Western India\r\nknown as the Concan, lying between Daman and Goa.\r\n\r\n=History=—The fruit is mentioned by Garcia d’Orta(1563) as known to\r\nthe Portuguese of Goa by the name of _Brindones_. He states that it\r\nhas a pleasant taste though very sour, and that it is used in dyeing;\r\nand further that the peel serves to make a sort of vinegar. Several\r\nsucceeding authors (as Bauchin and Ray) have contented themselves with\r\nrepeating this account.\r\n\r\nAs to the fruit yielding a fatty oil, we find no reference to such\r\nfact till about the year 1830, when it was stated in an Indian\r\nnewspaper[356] that an oil of the seeds is well known at Goa and often\r\nused to adulterate ghee (liquid butter). It was afterwards pointed out\r\nas the result of some experiments that the oil was of an agreeable\r\nbland taste and well adapted for use in pharmacy. A short article on\r\nKokum Butter was published by Pereira[357] in 1851. With the view of\r\nbringing the substance into use for pharmaceutical preparations in\r\nIndia, it has been introduced into the _Pharmacopœia of India_ of 1868.\r\n\r\n[352] _Report from H. M.

(1852) 65.\r\n\r\n=Preparation=—The seeds are reniform, somewhat crescent-shaped or\r\noblong, laterally compressed and wrinkled, ⁶/₁₀ to ⁸/₁₀ of an inch\r\nlong by about ⁴/₁₀ broad. Each seed weighs on an average about eight\r\ngrains. The thick cotyledons, which are inseparable,[358] have a mild\r\noily taste. Examination under the microscope shows them to be built\r\nup of large reticulated cells containing a considerable proportion of\r\ncrystalline fat readily soluble in benzol. In addition globular masses\r\nof albuminous matter occur which with iodine assume a brownish yellow\r\nhue. With perchloride of iron the walls strike a greenish-black.\r\n\r\nThe process followed by the natives of India (by whom alone the oil\r\nis prepared) has been thus described:—The seeds having been dried by\r\nexposure for some days to the sun are bruised, and boiled in water. The\r\noil collects on the surface, and concretes when cool into a cake which\r\nrequires to be purified by melting and straining.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Kokum Butter is found in the Indian bazaars in the form\r\nof egg-shaped or oblong lumps about 4 inches long by 2 inches in\r\ndiameter, and weighing about a quarter of a pound. It is a whitish\r\nsubstance, at ordinary temperatures, firm, dry, and friable, yet greasy\r\nto the touch. Scrapings (which are even pulverulent) when examined in\r\nglycerin under the microscope show it to be thoroughly crystalline.\r\nThey have a mild oily taste, yet redden litmus if moistened with\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nBy filtration in a steam-bath, kokum butter is obtained perfectly\r\ntransparent and of a light straw-colour, concentrating again at 27·5°\r\nC. into a white crystalline mass: some crystals appear even at 30°.\r\nMelted in a narrow tube, cooled and then warmed in a water bath, the\r\nfat begins to melt at 42·5 C., and fuses entirely at 45°. The residue\r\nleft after filtration of the crude fat is inconsiderable, and consists\r\nchiefly of brown tannic matters soluble in spirit of wine.\r\n\r\nWhen kokum butter is long kept it acquires an unpleasant rancid smell\r\nand brownish hue, and an efflorescence of shining tufted crystals\r\nappears on the surface of the mass.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Purified kokum butter boiled with caustic soda\r\nyields a fine hard soap which, when decomposed with sulphuric acid,\r\naffords a crystalline cake of fatty acids weighing as much as the\r\noriginal fat. The acids were again combined with soda and the soap\r\nhaving been decomposed, they were dissolved in alcohol of about 94\r\nper cent. By slow cooling and evaporation crystals were first formed\r\nwhich, when perfectly dried, melted at 69·5° C.: they are consequently\r\n_Stearic Acid_. A less considerable amount of crystals which separated\r\nsubsequently had a fusing point of 55°, and may be referred to\r\n_Myristic Acid_.\r\n\r\nA portion of the crude fat was heated with oxide of lead and water,\r\nand the plumbic compound dried and exhausted with ether, which after\r\nevaporation left a very small amount of liquid oil, which we refer to\r\n_Oleic Acid_.\r\n\r\nFinally the sulphuric acid used at the outset of the experiments was\r\nsaturated and examined in the usual manner for volatile fatty acids\r\n(butyric, valerianic, &c.) but with negative results.\r\n\r\n[358] The embryo, according to Bentley and Trimen (_l. c._) consists\r\nchiefly of the _thickened_ radicle, and is almost devoid of cotyledons.\r\n\r\nThe fat of the seeds of _G. indica_ was extracted by ether and examined\r\nchemically in 1857 by J. Bouis and d’Oliveira Pimentel.[359] It was\r\nobtained to the extent of 30 per cent., was found to fuse at 40° C. and\r\nto consist chiefly of stearin (tristearin). The seeds yielded 1·72 per\r\ncent. of nitrogen. Their residue after exhaustion by ether afforded to\r\nalkaline solutions or alcohol a fine red colour.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The results of the experiments above-noted show that kokum\r\nbutter is well suited for some pharmaceutical preparations. It might\r\nalso be advantageously employed in candle-making, as it yields stearic\r\nacid more easily and in a purer state than tallow and most other fats.\r\nBut that it is possible to obtain it in quantities sufficiently large\r\nfor important industrial uses, appears to us very problematical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPTEROCARPEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n=BALSAMUM DIPTEROCARPI.=\r\n\r\n_Balsamun Gurjunæ; Gurjun Balsam, Wood Oil._\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—This drug is yielded by several trees of the genus\r\n_Dipterocarpus_, namely—\r\n\r\n_D. turbinatus_ Gärtn. f. (_D. lævis_ Ham., _D. indicus_ Bedd), a\r\nnative of Eastern Bengal, Chittagong and Pegu to Singapore, and French\r\nCochin China.\r\n\r\n_D. incanus_ Roxb., a tree of Chittagong and Pegu.\r\n\r\n_D. alatus_ Roxb., growing in Chittagong, Burma, Tenasserim, the\r\nAndaman Islands, Siam, and French Cochin China.\r\n\r\n_D. zeylanicus_ Thw. and _D. hispidus_ Thw., indigenous to Ceylon.\r\n\r\n_D. crispalatus_ ... abounding, together with _D. turbinatus_ and _D.\r\nalatus_, in French Cochin China.\r\n\r\n_D. trinervis_ Bl., a native of Java and the Philippines, and _D.\r\ngracilis_ Bl., _D. littoralis_ Bl., _D. retusus_ Bl. (_D. Spanoghei_\r\nBl.), trees of Java supply a similar useful product which as yet\r\nappears to be of less commercial importance.[360]\r\n\r\nThe Gurjun trees are said by Hooker[361] to be among the most\r\nmagnificent of the forests of Chittagong. They are conspicuous for\r\ntheir gigantic size, and for the straightness and graceful form of\r\ntheir tall unbranched trunk, and small symmetrical crown of broad\r\nglossy leaves. Many individuals are upwards of 200 feet high and 15\r\nfeet in girth.\r\n\r\n=History=—Gurjun balsam was enumerated as one of the productions of\r\nAva by Francklin[362] in 1811, and in 1813 it was briefly noticed by\r\nAinslie.[363] Its botanical origin was first made known by Roxburgh,\r\nwho also described the method by which it is extracted.\r\n\r\n[359] _Comptes Rendus_, xliv. (1857) 1355.\r\n\r\n[360] That of _D. trinervis_ is especially used in Java.

(1855) 332.\r\n\r\n[362] _Tracts on the Dominions of Ava_, Lond. 1811. 26.\r\n\r\n[363] In the _Catalogue des Produits des_ _Colonies françaises,\r\nExposition Universelle de 1878_, p. 175, it is stated that the balsam\r\nof _D. alatus_ in French Cochin China is preferred, being a “_huile\r\nb’anche_.”\r\n\r\nThe medicinal properties of Gurjun balsam were pointed out by\r\nO’Shaughnessy[364] as entirely analogous to those of copaiba; and his\r\nobservations were confirmed by many practitioners in India. This has\r\nobtained for the drug a place in the _Pharmacopœia of India_ (1868).\r\n\r\n=Extraction=—A recent account of the production of this drug is found\r\nin the _Reports of the Jury of the Madras Exhibition of 1855_. It is\r\nthere stated that _Wood Oil_, as the balsam is commonly called, is\r\nobtained for the most part from the coast of Burma and the Straits,\r\nand is procured by tapping the trees about the end of the dry season.\r\nSeveral deep incisions are made with an axe into the trunk of the\r\ntree and a good-sized cavity scooped out. In this, fire is placed,\r\nand kept burning until the wood is somewhat scorched, when the balsam\r\nbegins to exude, and is then led away into a vessel of bamboo. It is\r\nafterwards allowed to settle, when a clear liquid separates from a\r\nthick portion called the “_guad_.” The oil is extracted year after\r\nyear, and sometimes there are two or three holes in the same tree. It\r\nis produced in extraordinary abundance; from 30 to 40 gallons according\r\nto Roxburgh may sometimes be obtained from a single tree in the course\r\nof a season, during which it is necessary to remove from time to time\r\nthe old charred surface of the wood and burn afresh.\r\n\r\nIf a growing tree is felled and cut into piece, the oleo-resin exudes\r\nand concretes on the wood, very much, it is said, _resembling camphor_\r\n(?) and having an aromatic smell.\r\n\r\n=Description=—As Gurjun balsam is the produce of different trees as\r\nwell as of different countries, it is not surprising to find that it\r\nvaries considerably in its properties.\r\n\r\nThe following observations refer to a balsam of which 400 lb. were\r\nrecently imported from Moulmein for a London drug firm. It is a thick\r\nand viscid fluid, exhibiting a remarkable fluorescence, so that when\r\nseen by reflected light it appears opaque and of dingy greenish grey;\r\nyet when placed between the observer and strong daylight it is seen to\r\nbe perfectly transparent and of a dark reddish-brown.[365] It has a\r\nweak aromatic copaiba-like odour and a bitterish aromatic taste without\r\nthe persistent acridity of copaiba. Its sp. gr. at 16·9° C. is 0·964.\r\n\r\n[364] _Mat. Med. of Hindoostan_, Madras, 1813. 186.\r\n\r\n[365] _Bengal Dispensatory_, 1842. 22.\r\n\r\nWith the following liquids Gurjun affords perfectly clear solutions\r\nwhich are more or less fluorescent, namely pure benzol (from benzoate\r\nof calcium), cumol, chloroform, sulphide of carbon, essential oils. On\r\nthe other hand, it is not entirely soluble in methylic, ethylic, or\r\namylic alcohol; in ether, acetic ether, glacial acetic acid, acetone,\r\nphenol (carbolic acid), or in caustic potash dissolved in absolute\r\nalcohol. Many samples of commercial benzin also are not capable of\r\ndissolving the oleo-resin perfectly, but we have not ascertained on\r\nwhat constituent of such benzin this depends. We have further noticed\r\nthat that portion of petroleum which is known as _Petroleum Ether_,\r\ncontaining the most volatile hydrocarbons, does not wholly dissolve the\r\noleo-resin. One hundred parts of the balsam warmed and shaken with\r\n1000 parts of absolute alcohol yielded on cooling a precipitate of\r\nresin amounting when dried to 18·5 parts. All concentrated solutions of\r\nthe balsam are precipitated by amylic alcohol.\r\n\r\nIf the balsam is kept for a long time in a stoppered vessel at 100° C.\r\nit simply becomes a little turbid; but about 130° C. it is transformed\r\ninto a jelly, and on cooling does not resume its former fluidity.\r\nBalsam of copaiba heated in a closed glass tube to 220° C. does not at\r\nall lose its fluidity, whereas Gurjun balsam becomes an almost solid\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Of the balsam 6·99 grammes dissolved in\r\nbenzol and kept in a water bath until the residue ceased to lose\r\nweight, yielded 3·80 grammes of a dry, transparent, semi-fluid resin,\r\ncorresponding to 54·44 per cent., and 45·56 of volatile matters\r\nexpelled by evaporation. But another sample afforded us much less\r\nresidue. By submitting larger quantities of the above balsam to the\r\nusual process of distillation with water in a large copper still, 37\r\nper cent. of volatile oil were easily obtained. The water passing over\r\nat the same time did not redden litmus paper. A dark, viscid, liquid\r\nresin remained in the still.\r\n\r\nThe essential oil is of a pale straw-colour and less odorous than\r\nmost other volatile oils. Treated with chloride of calcium and again\r\ndistilled, it begins to boil at 210° C. and passes over at 255°-260°\r\nC., acquiring a somewhat empyreumatic smell and light yellowish tint.\r\nThe purified oil has a sp. gr. of 0·915;[366] it is but sparingly\r\nsoluble in absolute alcohol or glacial acetic acid, but mixes readily\r\nwith amylic alcohol.\r\n\r\nAccording to Werner (1862) this oil has the composition C₂₀H₃₂ like\r\nthat of copaiba. He says it deviates the ray of polarized light to the\r\nleft, but that prepared by one of us deviated strongly to the _right_,\r\nthe residual resin dissolved in benzol being wholly inactive. The\r\noil does not form a crystalline compound with dry hydrochloric acid,\r\nwhich colours it of a beautiful blue.[367] De Vry[368] states that the\r\nessential oil after this treatment deviates the ray to the right.\r\n\r\nThe resin contains, like that of copaiba, a small proportion of a\r\ncrystallizable acid which may be removed by warming it with ammonia\r\nin weak alcohol. That part of the resin which is insoluble even in\r\nabsolute alcohol,[369] we found to be uncrystallizable. The _Gurgunic\r\nAcid_, as the crystallized resinous acid is called by Werner,[370]\r\nbut which it is more correct to write _Gurjunic_, may consequently\r\nbe prepared by extracting the resin with alcohol (·838) and mixing\r\nthe solution with ammonia. From the ammoniacal solution gurjunic acid\r\nis precipitated on addition of a mineral acid, and if it is again\r\ndissolved in ether and alcohol it may be procured in the form of small\r\ncrystalline crusts. From the specimen under examination we were not\r\nsuccessful in obtaining indubitable crystals.\r\n\r\n[366] 0·944 according to Werner; 0·931 O’Shaughnessy; 0·928 De Vry\r\n(1857).\r\n\r\n[367] This magnificent colouring matter is not dissolved by ether.\r\n\r\n[368] _Pharm. Journ._ xvi. (1857) 374.\r\n\r\n[369] The sample of gurjun balsam examined by Werner as well as the\r\nresin it contained were entirely soluble in boiling potash lye.\r\n\r\n[370] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, xvii. 545.\r\n\r\nGurjunic acid, C₄₄H₆₈O₈ according to Werner, melts at 220° C., and\r\nconcretes again at 180° C.; it begins to boil at 260° C., yet at the\r\nsame time decomposition takes place. By assigning to this acid the\r\nformula C₄₄H₆₄O₅ + 3H₂O, which agrees well with Werner’s analytical\r\nresults, we may regard it as a hydrate of abietinic acid, the chemical\r\nbehaviour of which is perfectly analogous. Gurjunic acid is soluble in\r\nalcohol 0·838, but not in weak alcohol; it is dissolved also by ether,\r\nbenzol, or sulphide of carbon (Werner).\r\n\r\nIn copaiba from Maracaibo, Strauss (1865) discovered _Metacopaivic\r\nAcid_ which is probably identical with gurjunic; the former, however,\r\nfuses at 206° C.\r\n\r\nThe amorphous resin forming the chief bulk of the residue of the\r\ndistillation of the balsam, has not yet been submitted to exact\r\nanalysis. We find that after complete desiccation it is not soluble\r\nin absolute alcohol. A crystallized constituent of Gurjun, which\r\nwe obtained from a balsam of unknown origin, has been shown[371]\r\nto answer to the formula C₂₈H₄₆O₂. Its crystals, belonging to the\r\nasymmetric system, melt at 126°-130°C.; they are entirely devoid of\r\nacid character. A comparative examination of the product of each of the\r\nabove named species of Dipterocarpus would be highly desirable.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Gurjun balsam is exported from Singapore, Moulmein, Akyab\r\nand the Malayan Peninsula, and is a common article of trade in Siam. It\r\nis likewise produced in Canara in Southern India. It is occasionally\r\nshipped to Europe. More than 2000 lb. were offered for sale in London\r\nunder the name of _East India Balsam Capivi_, 4th October 1855; and\r\nin October 1858, a no less quantity than 45 casks appeared in the\r\ncatalogue of a London drug-broker. It is now not unfrequent in the\r\nLondon drug sales.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—In medicine it has hitherto been employed only as a substitute\r\nfor copaiba, and chiefly in the hospitals of India.\r\n\r\nIn the East its great use is as a natural varnish, either alone\r\nor combined with pigments; and also as a substitute for tar as an\r\napplication to the seams of boats, and for preserving timber from the\r\nattacks of the white ant. To the first application it is often made\r\nbetter appropriated[372] by boiling it, so that the essential oil is\r\nevaporated.\r\n\r\n_Wood Oil of China_—The oleo-resin of Dipterocarpus must not be\r\nconfounded with the so-called _Wood Oil_ of China, which is of a\r\ntotally different nature. The latter is a fatty oil expressed from\r\nthe seeds of _Aleurites cordata_ Müll. Arg. (_Dryandra cordata_\r\nThunb. _Elaeococca Vernicia_ Sprgl. Prodromus xv. part 2, p. 724),\r\nthe well-known _Tung_ tree of the Chinese. It is a large tree of the\r\norder _Euphorbiaceæ_, found in China and Japan. The oil is an article\r\nof enormous consumption among the Chinese, who use it in the caulking\r\nand painting of junks and boats, for preserving woodwork, varnishing\r\nfurniture, and also in medicine. In the commercial reports of H.M.\r\nConsuls in China (No. 5, 1875, p. 3, 26) we find that this oil is\r\nlargely exported from Hankow: 199·654 peculs in 1874, and forms an\r\narticle of import at Ningpo: 15·123 peculs in 1874 (pecul = 133·33 lb.\r\navoirdupois). It is, however, not shipped to foreign countries. The\r\noil of the Tung tree is also extremely remarkable on account of its\r\nchemical properties as shown by Cloëz (1875-1877).\r\n\r\n[371] Flückiger, _Pharm.

In southern Siberia Althæa has been met with by Semenoff (1857)\r\nascending as high as 3,000 feet in the Alatau mountains, south of the\r\nBalkash Lake.\r\n\r\nIn Britain it occurs in the low grounds bordering the Thames below\r\nLondon, and here and there in many other spots in the south of England\r\nand of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated marshmallow thrives as far north as Throndhjem in\r\nNorway, and has been naturalized in North America (salt marshes of\r\nNew England and New York) and Australia. It is largely cultivated in\r\nBavaria and Württemberg.\r\n\r\n=History=—Marshmallow had many uses in ancient medicine, and is\r\ndescribed by Dioscorides as Άλθαία, a name derived from the Greek verb\r\nἀλθειν, _to heal_.\r\n\r\nThe diffusion of the plant in Europe during the middle ages was\r\npromoted by Charlemagne who enjoined[373] its culture (A.D. 812) under\r\nthe name of “_Mismalvas_, id est alteas quod dicitur ibischa.”\r\n\r\n=Description=—The plant has a perennial root attaining about a foot in\r\nlength and an inch in diameter. For medicinal use the biennial roots\r\nof the cultivated plant are chiefly employed. When fresh they are\r\nexternally yellowish and wrinkled, white within and of tender fleshy\r\ntexture. Previous to drying, the thin outer and a portion of the middle\r\nbark are scraped off, and the small root filaments are removed. The\r\ndrug thus prepared and dried consists of simple whitish sticks 6 to 8\r\ninches long, of the thickness of the little finger to that of a quill,\r\ndeeply furrowed longitudinally and marked with brownish scars. Its\r\ncentral portion, which is pure white, breaks with a short fracture, but\r\nthe bark is tough and fibrous. The dried root is rather flexible and\r\neasily cut. Its transverse section shows the central woody column of\r\nundulating outline separated from the thick bark by a fine dark outline\r\nshaded off outwards.\r\n\r\nThe root has a peculiar though very faint odour, and is of rather\r\nmawkish and insipid taste, and very slimy when chewed.\r\n\r\n[373] Pertz, _Monumenta Germaniæ historica_, Legum tom. i. (1835)\r\n181.—_Ibischa_ from the Greek ὶβίσκος.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The greater part of the bark consists of liber,\r\nabounding in long soft fibres, to which the toughness of the cortical\r\ntissue is due. They are branched and form bundles, each containing from\r\n3 to 30 fibres separated by parenchymatous tissue. Of the cortical\r\nparenchyme many cells are loaded with starch granules, others contain\r\nstellate groups of oxalate of calcium, and a considerable number of\r\nsomewhat larger cells are filled with mucilage. The last named on\r\naddition of alcohol is seen to consist of different layers.\r\n\r\nThe woody part is made up of pitted or scalariform vessels, accompanied\r\nby a few ligneous cells and separated by a parenchymatous tissue,\r\nagreeing with that of the bark. On addition of an alkali, sections of\r\nthe root assume a bright yellow hue.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The mucilage in the dry root amounts to about\r\n25 per cent. and the starch to as much more. The former appears from\r\nthe not very accordant analysis of Schmidt and of Mulder to agree\r\nwith the formula C₁₂H₂₀O₁₀, thus differing from the mucilage of gum\r\narabic by one molecule less of water. It likewise differs in being\r\nprecipitable by neutral acetate of lead. At the same time it does not\r\nshow the behaviour of cellulose, as it does not turn blue by iodine\r\nwhen moistened with sulphuric acid, and it is not soluble in ammoniacal\r\nsolution of oxide of copper.\r\n\r\nThe root also contains pectin and sugar (cane-sugar according to\r\nWittstock), and a trace of fatty oil. Tannin is found in very small\r\nquantity in the outer bark alone.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 Bacon, a pharmacien of Caen, obtained from althæa root crystals\r\nof a substance at first regarded as peculiar, but subsequently\r\nidentified with _Asparagin_, C₄H₈N₂O₃, H₂O. It had been previously\r\nprepared (1805) by Vauquelin and Robiquet from Asparagus, and is now\r\nknown to be a widely diffused constituent of plants.[374] Marshmallow\r\nroot does not yield more than 0·8 to 2·0 per cent. Asparagin\r\ncrystallizes in large prisms or octohedra of the rhombic system; it is\r\nnearly tasteless, and appears destitute of physiological action. Its\r\nrelation to succinic acid may be thus represented:—\r\n\r\n    Succinic acid: C₂H₄ {COOH; Asparagin: C₂H₃(NH₂) {CONH₂\r\n                        {COOH                       {COOH.\r\n\r\nAsparagin is quite permanent whether in the solid state or dissolved,\r\nbut it is easily decomposed if the solution contains the albuminoid\r\nconstituents of the root, which act as a ferment. Leguminous seeds,\r\nyeast or decayed cheese induce the same change, the final product of\r\nwhich is succinate of ammonium, the asparagin taking the elements of\r\nwater and hydrogen set free by the fermentation, thus—\r\n\r\n    C₄H₈N₂O₃ + H₂O + 2H = 2NH₄, C₄H₄O₄\r\n    Asparagin.       Succinate of Ammonium.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of acids or bases, or even by the prolonged boiling\r\nof its aqueous solution, asparagin is converted into _Aspartate of\r\nAmmonium_, C₄H₆(NH₄)NO₄, of which the hydrated asparagin contains the\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n[374] It plays an interesting part in the germination of the seeds of\r\npapilionaceous and other plants. It is abundant in the young plants,\r\nbut in most it speedily disappears. Its presence can be proved in the\r\njuice by means of the microscope and absolute alcohol, in which latter\r\nasparagin is insoluble. See Pfeffer in Pringsheim’s _Jahrb. f. wiss.\r\nBot._ 1872. 533-564.—Borodin in _Bot. Zeitung_, 1878. 801 and seq.\r\n\r\nThese transformations, especially the former, are undergone by the\r\nasparagin in the root, if the latter has been imperfectly dried, or has\r\nbeen kept long, or not very dry. Under such conditions, the asparagin\r\ngradually disappears, and the root then yields a brownish decoction,\r\nsometimes having a disagreeable odour of butyric acid. There is no\r\ndoubt that a protein-substance here acts as a ferment. The sections\r\nof the root when touched with ammonia or caustic lye should display a\r\nbright yellow, not a dingy brown, colour.\r\n\r\nThe peeled root dried at 100° C. and incinerated afforded us 4·88 of\r\nash, rich in phosphates.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Althæa is taken as a demulcent; it is sometimes also applied as\r\nan emollient poultice. It is far more largely used on the continent\r\nthan in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS HIBISCI ESCULENTI.\r\n\r\n_Capsulæ Hibisci esculenti_; _Uëhka_, _Okro_, _Okra_, _Bendi-kai_[375];\r\nF. _Gombo_ (in the French Colonies).\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Hibiscus esculentus_ L. (_Abelmoschus esculentus\r\nGuill. et Perr._) an herbaceous annual plant 2 to 3 or even 10 feet\r\nhigh, indigenous to the Old World.[376] It has been found growing\r\nabundantly wild on the White Nile by Schweinfurth, and also in 1861 by\r\nCol. Grant in Unyoro, 2° N. lat., near the lake Victoria Nyanza, where\r\nit is known to the natives as Bameea.\r\n\r\nThe plant is now largely cultivated in several varieties in all\r\ntropical countries.\r\n\r\n=History=—The Spanish Moors appear to have been well acquainted with\r\n_Hibiscus esculentus_, which was known to them by the same name that\r\nit has in Persian at the present day—_Bámiyah_. Abul Abbas el-Nebáti,\r\na native of Seville learned in plants, who visited Egypt in A.D. 1216,\r\ndescribes[377] in unmistakeable terms the form of the plant, its seeds\r\nand fruit, which last he remarks is eaten when young and tender with\r\nmeat by the Egyptians. The plant was figured among Egyptian plants in\r\n1592 by Prosper Alpinus,[378] who mentions its uses as an external\r\nemollient.\r\n\r\nThe powdered fruits as imported from Arabia Felix were known for some\r\ntime (about the year 1848) in Europe as _Nafé of the Arabs_. They are\r\nnoticed in the present work from the circumstance that they have a\r\nplace in the _Pharmacopœia of India_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit is a thin capsule, 4 to 6 or more inches long\r\nand about an inch in diameter, oblong, pointed, with 5 to 7 ridges\r\ncorresponding to the valves and cells, each of which latter contains a\r\nsingle row of round seeds. It is covered with rough hairs and is green\r\nor purplish when fresh; it has a slightly sweet mucilaginous taste and\r\na weak herbaceous odour. Like many other plants of the order, _Hibiscus\r\nesculentus_ abounds in all its parts with insipid mucilage.\r\n\r\n[375] Uëhka in Arabic, according to Schweinfurth. _Okro_ or _Okra_ are\r\ncommon names for the plant in the East and West Indies. _Bendi-kai_, a\r\nCanarese and Tamil word, is used by Europeans in the South of India.\r\n_Gigambo_ in Curaçao.\r\n\r\n[376] Fig. Bentley and Trimen, _Med.

Ægypt._, Venet. 1592. cap. 27.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—A characteristic part for microscopic\r\nexamination are the hairs of the fruit. They exhibit at the base one\r\nlarge cell, but their elongated and often slightly curved end is built\r\nup at a considerable number of small cells, without any solid contents.\r\nThe middle and outer zone of the pericarp shows enormous holes filled\r\nup with colourless mucilage. In polarized light it is easily seen to be\r\ncomposed of successive layers.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—It is probable that the fruits contain the same\r\nmucilage as _Althæa_, but we have had no opportunity of investigating\r\nthe fact. Landrin[379] says it turns violet with iodine and yields no\r\nmucic acid when treated with nitric acid. Popp, who examined the green\r\nfruits in Egypt, states[380] that they abound in pectin, starch and\r\nmucilage. He found that when dried they afforded 2 to 2·4 per cent. of\r\nnitrogen, and an ash rich in salts of lime, potash and magnesia. The\r\nripe seeds gave 2·4-2·5 per cent. of nitrogen; their ash 24 per cent.\r\nof phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The fresh or dried, unripe fruits are used in tropical countries\r\nas a demulcent like marshmallow, or as an emollient poultice, for which\r\nlatter purpose the leaves may also be employed. They are more important\r\nfrom an economic point of view, being much employed for thickening\r\nsoups or eaten boiled as a vegetable. The root has been recommended as\r\na substitute for that of _Althæa_.[381] The stems of the plant yield a\r\ngood fibre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTERCULIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n=OLEUM CACAO.=\r\n\r\n_Butyrum Cacao_, _Oleum Theobromatis_; _Cacao Butter_, _Oil of\r\nTheobroma_; F. _Beurre de Cacao_; G. _Cacaobutter_, _Cacaotalg_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—Cacao seeds (from which Cacao Butter is extracted)\r\nare furnished by _Theobroma Cacao_ L., and apparently also by _Th.\r\nleiocarpum_ Bernoulli, _Th. pentagonum_ Bern., and _Th. Salzmannianum_\r\nBern.[382] These trees are found in the northern parts of South America\r\nand in Central America as far as Mexico, both in a wild state and in\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n=History=—Cacao seeds were first noticed by Capitan Gonzalo Fernandez\r\nde Oviedo y Valdés (1514-1523), who stated[383] that they had been\r\nmet with by Columbus, being used among the inhabitants of Yucatan\r\ninstead of money. They were likewise pointed out to Charles V., by\r\nCortes in one of his letters to the Emperor, dated Temixtitan, Sept.\r\n3rd 1526.[384] The tree as well as the seeds and their uses, were at\r\nlength described by Benzoni,[385] who lived in the new world from 1541\r\nto 1555. Clusius figured the seeds in his “Notæ in Garciæ Aromatum\r\nhistoriam,” Antwerpiæ, 1582.\r\n\r\n[379] _Journ. de Pharm._ 22 (1875) 278.\r\n\r\n[380] _Archiv der Pharmacie_, cxcv.

The\r\nnatural seeds consist of about 12 per cent. of shell (testa) and 88 of\r\nkernels (cotyledons).\r\n\r\n=Description=—At ordinary temperatures cacao butter is a light\r\nyellowish, opaque, dry substance, usually supplied in the form of\r\noblong tablets having somewhat the aspect of white Windsor soap. Though\r\nunctuous to touch, it is brittle enough to break into fragments when\r\nstruck, exhibiting a dull waxy fracture. It has a pleasant odour of\r\nchocolate, and melts in the mouth with a bland agreeable taste. Its sp.\r\ngr. is 0·961; its fusing point 20° to 30° C.\r\n\r\nExamined under the microscope by polarized light, cacao butter is seen\r\nto consist of minute crystals. It is dissolved by 20 parts of boiling\r\nabsolute alcohol, but on cooling separates to such an extent that the\r\nliquid retains not more than 1 per cent. in solution. The fat separated\r\nafter refrigeration is found to have lost most of its chocolate\r\nflavour. Litmus is not altered by the hot alcoholic solution.\r\n\r\nCacao butter in small fragments is slowly dissolved by double its\r\nweight of benzol in the cold (10° C.), but by keeping partially\r\nseparates in crystalline warts.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The fat under notice is composed, in common with\r\nothers, of several bodies which by saponification furnish glycerin and\r\nfatty acids. Among the latter occurs also oleic acid,[390] contained in\r\nthat part of the cacao butter which remains dissolved in cold alcohol\r\nas above stated. In fact by evaporating that solution a soft fat is\r\nobtained. But the chief constituents of cacao butter appear to be\r\nstearin, palmitin, and another compound of glycerin containing probably\r\nan acid of the same series richer in carbon,—perhaps arachic acid,\r\nC₂₀H₄₀O₂, or “_theobromic acid_” C₆₄H₁₂₈O₂, as suggested in 1877 by\r\nKingzett.\r\n\r\n[386] _Hist. d. l’Acad.

It sows itself as a weed in tilled ground, and is\r\nnow found in all temperate and tropical regions of the globe. Heer\r\nregards it as a variety evolved by cultivation from the perennial _L.\r\nangustifolium_ Huds.\r\n\r\n=History=—The history of flax, its textile fibre and seed, is\r\nintimately connected with that of human civilisation. The whole process\r\nof converting the plant into a fibre fit for weaving into cloth is\r\nfrequently depicted on the wall-paintings of the Egyptian tombs.[391]\r\nThe grave-clothes of the old Egyptians were made of flax, and the use\r\nof the fibre in Egypt may be traced back, according to Unger,[392] as\r\nfar as the 23rd century B.C. The old literature of the Hebrews[393]\r\nand Greeks contains frequent reference to tissues of flax; and fabrics\r\nwoven of flax have actually been discovered together with fruits\r\nand seeds of the plant in the remains of the ancient pile-dwellings\r\nbordering the lakes of Switzerland.[394]\r\n\r\nThe seed in ancient times played an important part in the alimentation\r\nof man. Among the Greeks, Alcman in the 7th century B.C., and the\r\nhistorian Thucydides, and among the Romans Pliny, mention linseed\r\nas employed for human food. The roasted seed is still eaten by the\r\nAbyssinians.[395]\r\n\r\nTheophrastus expressly alludes to the mucilaginous and oily properties\r\nof the seed. Pliny and Dioscorides were acquainted with its medical\r\napplication both external and internal. The latter, as well as\r\nColumella, exhaustively describes flax under its agricultural aspect.\r\nIn an edict of the Emperor Diocletian _De pretiis rerum venalium_[396]\r\ndating A.D. 301, linseed is quoted 150 _denarii_, sesamé seed 200, hemp\r\nseed 80, and poppy seed 150, the _modius castrensis_, equal to about\r\n880 cubic inches.[397] The propagation of flax in Northern Europe as of\r\nso many other useful plants was promoted by Charlemagne.[398] It seems\r\nto have reached Sweden and Norway before the 12th century.[399]\r\n\r\n[391] Wilkinson, _Ancient Egyptians_, iii.

The seeds are of\r\nflattened, elongated ovoid form with an acute edge, and a slightly\r\noblique point blunt at one end. They have a brown, glossy, polished\r\nsurface which under a lens is seen to be marked with extremely fine\r\npits. The hilum occupies a slight hollow in the edge just below the\r\napex. The testa which is not very hard encloses a thin layer of\r\nalbumen surrounding a pair of large cotyledons having at their pointed\r\nextremity a straight embryo. The seeds of different countries vary\r\nfrom ¼ to ⅙ of an inch in length, those produced in warm regions being\r\nlarger than those grown in cold. We find that 6 seeds of Sicilian\r\nlinseed, 13 of Black Sea and 17 of Archangel linseed weigh respectively\r\n_one grain_.\r\n\r\nWhen immersed in water, the seeds become surrounded by a thin,\r\nslippery, colourless, mucous envelope, which quickly dissolves as a\r\nneutral jelly, while the seed slightly swells and loses its polish. The\r\nseed when masticated has a mucilaginous oily taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—On examining the testa under almond oil or oil\r\nof turpentine, the outlines of the epidermal cells are not distinctly\r\nvisible. But under dilute glycerin or in water the epidermis quickly\r\nswells up to 3 or 4 times its original thickness; on warming, the\r\nentire epidermis is resolved into mucilage, except a thin skeleton\r\nof cell-walls, which withstands even the action of caustic lye. The\r\nformation of the mucilage may be conveniently studied by the use of a\r\nsolution of ferrous sulphate, with which thin sections of the testa\r\nshould be moistened. Other structural peculiarities may be seen if they\r\nare imbued with concentrated sulphuric acid, washed and then moistened\r\nwith a solution of iodine. The application of polarized light is also\r\nuseful. By the latter means crystalloid granules of albuminoid matter\r\nbecome visible if the sections are examined under oil. The tissue of\r\nthe albumen and the cotyledons abounds in drops of fatty oil.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The constituent of chief importance is the fixed\r\noil which the seed contains to about ⅓ of its weight. The proportion\r\nobtained by pressure on a large scale is 20 to 30 per cent. varying\r\nwith the quality of the seed. The oil when pressed without heat and\r\nwhen fresh has but little colour, is without unpleasant taste, and does\r\nnot solidify till cooled to -20° C. The commercial oil however is dark\r\nyellow, and has a sharp repulsive taste and odour. On exposure to the\r\nair, especially after having been heated with oxide of lead, it quickly\r\ndries up to a transparent varnish consisting chiefly of _Linoxyn_,\r\nC₃₂H₅₄O₁₁. The crude oil increases in weight 11 to 12 per cent.,\r\nalthough at the same time its glycerin is destroyed by oxidation.\r\n\r\nBy saponification, linseed oil yields glycerin, and 95 per cent.\r\nof fatty acids, consisting chiefly of _Linoleic Acid_, C₁₆H₂₆O₂,\r\naccompanied by some oleic, palmitic, and myristic acid. The action\r\nof the air transforms linoleic acid into the resinoid _Oxylinoleic\r\nAcid_, C₁₆H₂₆O₅. Linoleic acid appears to be contained in all drying\r\noils, notably in that of poppy seed. It is not homologous either\r\nwith ordinary fatty acids or with the oleic acid of oil of almonds,\r\nC₁₈H₃₄O₂. The chemistry of the drying oils, especially those of linseed\r\nand poppy, has been particularly investigated by Mulder.[400]\r\n\r\nThe viscid mucilage of linseed cannot be filtered till it has been\r\nboiled. It contains in the dry state more than 10 per cent. of mineral\r\nsubstances, when freed from which and dried at 110° C. it corresponds,\r\nlike althæa-mucilage, to the formula C₁₂H₂₀O₁₀. The seeds by exhaustion\r\nwith cold or warm water afford of it about 15 per cent. By boiling\r\nnitric acid it yields crystals of mucic acid; by dilute mineral acids\r\nit is broken up into dextrogyre gum and sugar and cellulose.[401]\r\n\r\nLinseed contains about 4 per cent. of nitrogen corresponding to about\r\n25 per cent. of protein-substances. After expression of the oil these\r\nsubstances remain in the cake so completely that the latter contains\r\n5 per cent. of nitrogen, and constitutes a very important article for\r\nfeeding cattle.\r\n\r\nIn the ripe state linseed is altogether destitute of starch, though\r\nthis substance is found in the immature seed in the very cells which\r\nsubsequently yield the mucilage. The latter may be regarded as in\r\nanalogous cases to be a product of the transformation of starch.\r\n\r\nThe amount of water retained by the air-dry seed is about 9 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe mineral constituents of linseed, chiefly phosphates of potassium,\r\nmagnesium, and calcium, amount on an average to 3 per cent., and\r\npass into the mucilage. By treating thin slices of the testa and its\r\nadhering inner membrane with ferrous sulphate, it is seen that this\r\nintegument is the seat of a small amount of tannin.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—Flax is cultivated on the largest scale in\r\nRussia, from which country there was imported into the United Kingdom\r\nin 1872 linseed to the value of 3 millions sterling. The shipments were\r\nmade in about equal proportion from the northern and the southern ports\r\nof Russia.\r\n\r\nThe imports from India in the same year amounted in value to\r\n£1,144,942, and from Germany and Holland to £144,108. The total import\r\nin 1872 was 1,514,947 quarters, value £4,513,842.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of flax in Great Britain appears to be declining. The\r\narea under this crop in 1870 was 23,957 acres; in 1871, 17,366 acres;\r\nin 1872, 15,357 acres; and in 1873, 14,683 acres. The last named\r\narea reckoning the yield at 2 to 2½ quarters of seed per acre would\r\nrepresent a production of about 30,000 to 38,000 quarters.\r\n\r\n[400] His numerous investigations on this subject have been published\r\nin a separate pamphlet, of which we have before us a German\r\ntranslation: G. J. Mulder, _Die Chemie der austrocknenden Oele_ ...\r\nBerlin, 1867, pp. 255.\r\n\r\n[401] Kirchner and Tollens, _Annalen der Chemie_, 175 (1874) 215.\r\n\r\nIn English price-currents, eight sorts of linseed are enumerated,\r\nnamely, English, Calcutta, Bombay, Egyptian, Black Sea and Azof,\r\nPetersburg, Riga, Archangel. The first three appear to fetch the\r\nhighest prices.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—In medicine, linseed is chiefly used in the form of poultice\r\nwhich may be made either of the seed simply ground or of the pulverized\r\ncake. In either case the powder should not be long stored, as the oil\r\nin the comminuted seed is rapidly oxidized and fatty acids produced.\r\nAn infusion of the seeds called _Linseed Tea_ is a common popular\r\ndemulcent remedy.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Linseed is very liable to adulteration with other seeds,\r\nespecially when the commodity is scarce. The admixture in question\r\nis due in part to careless harvesting and in part to intentional\r\nadditions. In 1864 the impure condition of the linseed shipped to\r\nthe English market had become so detrimental to the trade that the\r\nimporters and crushers founded an association called _The Linseed\r\nAssociation of London_, by which they bound themselves to refuse all\r\nlinseed containing more than 4 per cent. of foreign seeds, and this\r\nstep very rapidly improved the quality of the article.[402]\r\n\r\n[402] Greenish in _Yearbook of Pharmacy_, 1871. 590; _Pharm. Journ._\r\nSept. 9, 1871. 211.\r\n\r\nAs the druggist has to _purchase_ linseed meal, he must of necessity\r\nrely to some extent on the character of the oil-presser from whom he\r\nderives his supplies. The presence of the seeds of _Cruciferæ_ (as\r\nrape and mustard) which is common, may be recognized by the pungent\r\nodour of the essential oil which they develope in contact with water.\r\nThe introduction of cereals would also be easily discovered by iodine,\r\nwhich strikes no blue colour in a decoction of linseed. The microscope\r\nwill also afford important aid in the examination of linseed cake or\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZYGOPHYLLEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGNUM GUAIACI.\r\n\r\n_Lignum sanctum_; _Guaiacum Wood_, _Lignum Vitæ_; F. _Bois de Gaïac_;\r\nG. _Guaiakholz_, _Pockholz_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—This wood is furnished by two West Indian species of\r\n_Guaiacum_, namely:—\r\n\r\n1. _G. officinale_ L., a middle-sized or low evergreen tree, with\r\nlight blue flowers, parapinnate leaves having ovate, very obtuse\r\nleaflets in 2, less often in 3 pairs, and 2-celled fruits. It grows in\r\nCuba, Jamaica (abundantly on the arid plains of the south side of the\r\nisland), Les Gonaives in the N.W. of Hayti (plentiful), St. Domingo,\r\nMartinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Trinidad, and the northern coast\r\nof the South American continent. This tree affords the Lignum Vitæ of\r\nJamaica (of which very little is imported), a portion of that shipped\r\nfrom the ports of Hayti, and probably the small quantity exported by\r\nthe United States of Colombia.\r\n\r\n2. _G. sanctum_ L., a tree much resembling the preceding, but\r\ndistinguishable by its leaves having 3 to 4 pairs of leaflets which\r\nare very obliquely obovate or oblong, passing into rhomboid-ovate, and\r\nmucronulate; and a 5-celled fruit. It is found in Southern Florida, the\r\nBahama Islands, Key West, Cuba, St. Domingo (including the part called\r\nHayti) and Puerto Rico, and is certainly the source of the small but\r\nexcellent Lignum Vitæ exported from the Bahamas as well as of some of\r\nthat shipped from Hayti.\r\n\r\n=History=—There can be no doubt but that the earliest importations\r\nof Lignum Vitæ were obtained from St. Domingo, of which island,\r\nOviedo[403] who landed in America in 1514 mentions the tree, under the\r\nname of _Guayacan_, as a native. He points out its fruits as yellow and\r\nresembling two joined lupines, which could only be said with reference\r\nto _G. officinale_, and would not apply to the ovoid five-cornered\r\nfruits of _G. sanctum_. Oviedo appears however to have been aware of\r\ntwo species, one of which he found in Española (St. Domingo) as well as\r\nin Nagrando (Nicaragua) and the other in the island of St. John (Puerto\r\nRico), whence it was called _Lignum sanctum_.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of Oviedo was printed in 1526; but some years before\r\nthis the wood must have been known in Germany, as is evident by the\r\ntreatises written in 1517, 1518, and 1519 by Nicolaus Poll,[404]\r\nLeonard Schmaus[405] and Ulrich von Hutten.[406] The last which gives\r\na tolerable description of the tree, its wood, bark, and medicinal\r\nproperties, was translated into English in 1533 by Thomas Paynel, canon\r\nof Merton Abbey, and published in London in 1536 under the title—“_Of\r\nthe wood called Guaiacum that healeth the Frenche Pockes and also\r\nhelpeth the gout in the feete, the stoone, the palsey, lepree, dropsy,\r\nfallynge euyll, and other dyseases._” It was several times reprinted.\r\n\r\nIn the old pharmacy the products of destructive distillation of\r\nguaiacum wood were known as _Oleum ligni sancti_. It must have\r\nconsisted of the substances which we mention further on in the\r\nfollowing article.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The wood (always known in commerce as _Lignum Vitæ_) as\r\nimported consists of pieces of the stem and thick branches, usually\r\nstripped of bark, and often weighing a hundredweight each. It is\r\nremarkably heavy and compact. Its sp. gr. which exceeds that of most\r\nwoods is about 1·3.\r\n\r\nLignum Vitæ is mostly imported for turnery,[407] and the chips,\r\nraspings and shavings are the only form in which it is commonly seen in\r\npharmacy. A stem 7 to 8 inches in diameter cut transversely exhibits a\r\nlight-yellowish zone of sapwood about an inch wide, enclosing a sharply\r\ndefined heartwood of a dark greenish brown. Both display alternate\r\nlighter and darker layers, which especially in the sapwood are further\r\ndistinguished by groups of vessels. In this manner are formed a large\r\nnumber of circles resembling annual rings, the general form of which\r\nis evident, though the individual rings are by no means well defined.\r\nMore than 20 such rings may be counted in the sapwood of a log such\r\nas we have mentioned, and more than 30 in the heartwood. The pithless\r\ncentre is usually out of the axis. The medullary rays are not visible\r\nto the naked eye, but may be seen by a lens to be very numerous and\r\nequidistant. The pores of the heartwood may be distinguished as\r\ncontaining a brownish resin, while those of the outermost layer of\r\nsapwood are empty.\r\n\r\n[403] _Natural Hystoria de las Indias_, Toledo, 1526. fol. xxxvii.\r\n\r\n[404] _Decura Morbi Gallici per Lignum Guayacanum libellus_, printed in\r\n1535 but dated 19 Dec. 1517, 8 pages 8°.\r\n\r\n[405] _De Morbo Gallico tractatus_, Salisburgi, November\r\n1518,—reprinted in the _Aphrodisiacus_ of Luisinus, Lugd.

(26 chapters) Moguntiæ, 1519.\r\n\r\n[407] It is much used for the wheels (technically “_sheaves_”) of\r\nships’ blocks (pulleys), the circumference of which ought to consist of\r\nthe white sapwood. It is also required for caulking mallets, skittle\r\nballs and for the large balls used in American bowling alleys, for\r\nwhich purposes it should be as sound and homogeneous as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the thickest pieces sapwood is wanting, and even in stems of about a\r\nfoot in diameter it is reduced to ⅕ of an inch. It is of looser texture\r\nthan the heartwood and floats on water, whereas the latter sinks. Both\r\nsapwood and heartwood owe their tenacity to an extremely peculiar\r\nzigzag arrangement[408] of the woody bundles. The sapwood is tasteless.\r\nThe heartwood has a faintly aromatic and slightly irritating taste, and\r\nwhen heated or rubbed emits a weak agreeable odour.\r\n\r\nThe bark which was formerly officinal but is now almost obsolete, is\r\nvery rich in oxalate of calcium and affords upon incineration not less\r\nthan 23 per cent. of ash. It contains a resin distinct from that of the\r\nwood, and also a bitter acrid principle.[409]\r\n\r\nThe Lignum Vitæ of Jamaica (_G. officinale_) and that of the Bahamas\r\n(_G. sanctum_), of which authentic specimens have been kindly placed at\r\nour disposal by Mr. G. Shadbolt, display the same appearance as well as\r\nmicroscopic structure.[410]\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The wood consists for the most part of pointed,\r\nnot very long, ligneous cells (libriform), traversed by one-celled\r\nrows of medullary rays. There are also thin layers of parenchymatous\r\ntissue, to which the zones apparent in a transverse section of the\r\ndrug are due. The pitted vessels are comparatively large but not very\r\nnumerous. The structure of the sapwood is the same as that of the\r\nheartwood, but in the latter the ligneous cells are filled with resin.\r\nThe parenchymatous cells contain crystals of oxalate of calcium.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The only constituent of any interest is the\r\nresin which the heartwood contains to the extent of about a fourth of\r\nits weight. The sapwood afforded us 0·91 and the heartwood 0·60 per\r\ncent. of ash.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Lignum Vitæ varies much in estimation, according to size,\r\nsoundness, and the cylindrical form of the logs. The best is exported\r\nfrom the city of Santo Domingo, whither it is brought from the interior\r\nof the island. The quantity shipped from this port during 1871 was 1494\r\ntons;[411] 220 tons were exported in 1877 from Puerto Plata on the\r\nnorthern coast of the island. The wood obtained from the Haytian ports\r\n(of the western part of the same island) is much less esteemed in the\r\nLondon market.\r\n\r\n[408] It has been remarkably well pointed out already by Valerius\r\nCordus (_obiit_ 1544). See Gesner’s edition of his _Hist. Stirpium\r\nArgentorat_., 1561. 191.\r\n\r\n[409] See also Oberlin et Schlagdenhauffen, _Journ. de Pharm._ 28\r\n(1878) 246 and plate vi.\r\n\r\n[410] That of _Guaiacum arboreum_ DC. is apparently very different.\r\nThis tree, occurring in New Granada, has already been noticed\r\n(1571-1577) by Francisco Hernandez (_Nova plantarum, animal, et\r\nmineral. mexicanor. hist._, Romæ 1651, fol. 63) under the name of\r\n_Guayacan_. He mentions its large umbels with yellow flowers, those of\r\nGuaiacum officinale, the “_Hoaxacan_” or Lignum sanctum, being blue. In\r\nthe _Prodromus Floræ Neo-Granatentis_ (_Ann. Scienc. nat._ xv., 1872.\r\np. 361) J. E. Planchon also describes Guaiacum arboreum, known there as\r\n_Guayacan polvillo_; its wood is of an almost pulverulent fracture.\r\n\r\n[411] _Consular Reports_ presented to Parliament, Aug. 1872.\r\n\r\nSome small wood of good quality comes from the Bahamas, and an ordinary\r\nquality, also small, from Jamaica. From the latter island, the quantity\r\nexported in 1871 was only 14 tons;[412] from the Bahamas in the same\r\nyear 199 tons.[413] Lignum Vitæ was shipped from Santa Marta in 1872 to\r\nthe extent of 115 tons.[414]\r\n\r\nHamburg is also an important place for the wood under notice; in 1877\r\nthere were imported 22,404 centners from S. Domingo and 3551 centners\r\nfrom Venezuela.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Guaiacum wood is only retained in the pharmacopœia as an\r\ningredient of the Compound Decoction of Sarsaparilla. It is probably\r\ninert, at least in the manner in which it is now administered.[415]\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—In purchasing guaiacum chips it is necessary to observe\r\nthat the non-resinous sapwood is absent, and still more that there is\r\nno admixture of any other wood. A spurious form of the drug seems to be\r\nby no means rare in the United States.[416]\r\n\r\n\r\nRESINA GUAIACI.\r\n\r\n_Guaiacum Resin_; F. _Résine de Gaïac_; G. _Guaiakharz_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Guaiacum officinale_ L., see preceding article.\r\n\r\n=History=—Hutten[417] in 1510 stated that guaiacum wood when set on\r\nfire exudes a blackish resin which quickly hardens, but of which he\r\nknew no use. The resin was in fact introduced into medicine much later\r\nthan the wood. The first edition of the _London Pharmacopœia_ in which\r\nwe find the former named is that of 1677.\r\n\r\n=Production=[418]—In the island of St. Domingo, whence the supplies\r\nof guaiacum resin are chiefly derived, the latter is collected from\r\nthe stems of the trees, in part as a natural exudation, and in part as\r\nthe result of incisions made in the bark. In some districts as in the\r\nisland of Gonave near Port-au-Prince, another method of obtaining it is\r\nadopted. A log of the wood is supported in a horizontal position above\r\nthe ground by two upright bars. Each end of the log is then set on\r\nfire, and a large incision having been previously made in the middle,\r\nthe melted resin runs out therefrom in considerable abundance. 36,350\r\nlbs. of it have been exported in 1875 from Port-au-Prince.\r\n\r\nThe resin is collected chiefly from _G. officinale_, which affords it\r\nin greater plenty than _G. sanctum_.\r\n\r\n[412] Blue Book—Island of Jamaica for 1871.\r\n\r\n[413] Blue Book for Colony of Bahamas for 1871.\r\n\r\n[414] _Consular Reports_, Aug. 1873. 746.\r\n\r\n[415] The ancient treatment of syphilis by guaiacum which gained for\r\nthe drug such immense reputation, consisted in the administration of\r\nvast quantities of the decoction, the patient being shut up in a warm\r\nroom and kept in bed.—See Hutten’s pamphlet quoted before, and its\r\nnumerous reprints and translations.\r\n\r\n[416] Schulz, in the (Chicago) _Pharmacist_, Sept. 1873.\r\n\r\n[417] _Op. cit._ at p. 101.\r\n\r\n[418] We have to thank Mr. Eugène Nau of Port-au-Prince for the\r\ninformation given under this head, as well as for some interesting\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The resin occurs in globular tears ½ an inch to 1 inch in\r\ndiameter, but much more commonly in the form of large compact masses,\r\ncontaining fragments of wood and bark. The resin is brittle, breaking\r\nwith a clean, glassy fracture; in thin pieces it is transparent and\r\nappears of a greenish brown hue. The powder when fresh is grey, but\r\nbecomes green by exposure to light and air. It has a slight balsamic\r\nodour and but little taste, yet leaves an irritating sensation in the\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nThe resin has a sp. gr. of about 1·2. It fuses at 85° C., emitting a\r\npeculiar odour somewhat like that of benzoin. It is easily soluble\r\nin acetone, ether, alcohol, amylic alcohol, chloroform, creosote,\r\ncaustic alkaline solutions, and oil of cloves; but is not dissolved\r\nor only partially by other volatile oils, benzol or bisulphide of\r\ncarbon. By oxidizing agents it acquires a fine blue colour, well shown\r\nwhen a fresh alcoholic solution is allowed to dry up in a very thin\r\nlayer and this is then sprinkled with a dilute alcoholic solution\r\nof ferric chloride. Reducing agents of all kinds, and heat produce\r\ndecoloration. An alcoholic solution may be thus blued and decolorized\r\nseveral times in succession, but it loses at length its susceptibility.\r\nThis remarkable property of guaiacum was utilized by Schönbein in his\r\nwell-known researches on ozone.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The composition of guaiacum resin was\r\nascertained by Hadelich (1862) to be as follows:—\r\n\r\n    Guaiaconic Acid,                                70·3 per cent.\r\n    Guaiaretic Acid,                                10·5   ”\r\n    Guaiac Beta-resin,                               9·8   ”\r\n    Gum,                                             3·7   ”\r\n    Ash constituents,                                0·8   ”\r\n    Guaiacic Acid, colouring matter (Guaiac-yellow),\r\n            and impurities,                          4·9   ”\r\n\r\nIf the mother-liquor obtained in the preparation of the potassium salt\r\nof guaiaretic acid (_vide infra_) is decomposed by hydrochloric acid,\r\nand the precipitate washed with water, ether will extract from the\r\nmass _Guaiaconic Acid_, a compound discovered by Hadelich, having the\r\nformula C₃₈H₄₀O₁₀. It is a light brown, amorphous substance, fusing at\r\n100° C. It is without acid reaction but decomposes alkaline carbonates,\r\nforming uncrystallizable salts easily soluble in water or alcohol. It\r\nis insoluble in water, benzol, or bisulphide of carbon, but dissolves\r\nin ether, chloroform, acetic acid or alcohol. With oxidizing agents it\r\nacquires a transient blue tint.\r\n\r\n_Guaiaretic Acid_, C₂₀H₂₆O₄, discovered by Hlasiwetz in 1859, may be\r\nextracted from the crude resin by alcoholic potash or by quicklime.\r\nWith the former it produces a crystalline salt; with the latter an\r\namorphous compound: from either the liquid, which contains chiefly a\r\nsalt of guaiaconic acid, may be easily decanted. Guaiaretic acid is\r\nobtained by decomposing one of the salts referred to with hydrochloric\r\nacid, and crystallizing from alcohol. The crystals, which are soluble\r\nalso in ether, benzol, chloroform, carbon bisulphide or acetic acid,\r\nbut neither in ammonia nor in water, melt below 80° C., and may be\r\nvolatilized without decomposition. The acid is not coloured blue by\r\noxidizing agents.\r\n\r\nBy exhausting guaiacum resin with boiling bisulphide of carbon a\r\nslightly yellowish solution is obtained (containing chiefly guaiaretic\r\nacid?), which, on addition of concentrated sulphuric acid, turns\r\nbeautifully red.\r\n\r\nAfter the extraction of the guaiaconic acid there remains a substance\r\ninsoluble in ether to which the name _Guaiac Beta-resin_ has been\r\napplied. It dissolves in alcohol, acetic acid or alkalis, and is\r\nprecipitated by ether, benzol, chloroform or carbon bisulphide in brown\r\nflocks, the composition of which appears not greatly to differ from\r\nthat of guaiaconic acid.\r\n\r\n_Guaiacic Acid_, C₁₂H₁₆O₆, obtained in 1841 by Thierry from guaiacum\r\nwood or from the resin, crystallizes in colourless needles. Hadelich\r\nwas not able to obtain more than one part from 20,000 of guaiacum resin.\r\n\r\nHadelich’s _Guaiac-yellow_, the colouring matter of guaiacum resin,\r\nfirst observed by Pelletier, crystallizes in pale yellow quadratic\r\noctohedra, having a bitter taste. Like the other constituents of the\r\nresin, it is not a glucoside.\r\n\r\nThe decomposition-products of guaiacum are of peculiar interest.\r\nOn subjecting the resin to dry distillation in an iron retort and\r\nrectifying the distillate, _Guaiacene_ (_Guajol_ of Völckel), C₅H₈O,\r\npasses over at 118° C. as a colourless neutral liquid having a burning\r\naromatic taste.\r\n\r\nAt 205°-210° C., there pass over other products, _Guaiacol_,\r\nC₆H₄·OCH₃·OH, (methylic ether of pyrocatechin), and _Kreosol_\r\nC₆H₃·OH(CH₃)₂. Both are thickish, aromatic, colourless liquids, which\r\nbecome green by caustic alkalis, blue by alkaline earths, and are\r\nsimilar in their chemical relations to eugenic acid. Guaiacol has been\r\nprepared synthetically by Gorup-Besanez (1868) by combining iodide of\r\nmethyl, CH₃I, with pyrocatechin, C₆H₄(OH)₂.\r\n\r\nAfter the removal by distillation of the liquids just described,\r\nthere sublime upon the further application of heat pearly crystals\r\nof _Pyroguaiacin_, C₃₈H₄₄O₆, an inodorous substance melting at 180°\r\nC. The same compound is obtained together with guaiacol by the dry\r\ndistillation of guaiaretic acid. Pyroguaiacin is coloured green by\r\nferric chloride, and blue by warm sulphuric acid. The similar reactions\r\nof the crude resin are probably due to this substance (Hlasiwetz).\r\n\r\nBeautiful coloured reactions are likewise exhibited by two new acids\r\nwhich Hlasiwetz and Barth obtained (1864) in small quantity together\r\nwith traces of fatty volatile acids, by melting purified resin\r\nof guaiacum with potassium hydrate. One of them is isomeric with\r\npyrocatechuic acid.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Guaiacum resin is reputed diaphoretic and alterative. It is\r\nfrequently prescribed in cases of gout and rheumatism.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The drug is sometimes imported in a very foul condition\r\nand largely contaminated with impurities arising from a careless method\r\nof collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUTACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTEX ANGOSTURÆ.\r\n\r\n_Cortex Cuspariæ_; _Angostura Bark_, _Cusparia Bark_, _Carony Bark_; F.\r\n_Ecorce d’Angusture de Colombie_; G. _Angostura-Rinde_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Galipea Cusparia_ St. Hilaire (_G. officinalis_\r\nHancock, _Bonplandia trifoliata_ Willd., _Cusparia trifoliata_ Engler\r\n1874, _Flora Brasil_. 113), a small tree, 12 to 15 feet high, with a\r\ntrunk 3 to 5 inches in diameter, growing in abundance on the mountains\r\nof San Joaquin de Caroni in Venezuela, between 7° and 8° N. lat., also\r\naccording to Bonpland[419] near Cumana. According to Hancock,[420] who\r\nwas well acquainted with the tree, it is also found in the Missions of\r\nTumeremo, Uri, Alta Gracia, and Cupapui, districts lying eastward of\r\nthe Caroni and near its junction with the Orinoko. The bark is brought\r\ninto commerce by way of Trinidad.\r\n\r\n=History=—Angostura Bark is said to have been used in Madrid by\r\nMutis as early as 1759[421] (the year before he left Spain for South\r\nAmerica,) but it was certainly unknown to the rest of Europe until\r\nmuch later. Its real introducer was Brande, apothecary to Queen\r\nCharlotte, and father of the distinguished chemist of the same name,\r\nwho drew attention to some parcels of the bark imported into England\r\nin 1788.[422] In the same year a quantity was sent to a London drug\r\nfirm by Dr. Ewer of Trinidad, who describes it[423] as brought to that\r\nisland from Angostura by the Spaniards. The drug continued to arrive\r\nin Europe either by way of Spain or England, and its use was gradually\r\ndiffused. In South America it is known as _Quina de Caroni_ and\r\n_Cascarilla del Angostura_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The bark occurs in flattish or channelled pieces, or\r\nin quills rarely as much as 6 inches in length and mostly shorter.\r\nThe flatter pieces are an inch or more in width and ⅛ of an inch in\r\nthickness. The outer side of the bark is coated with a yellowish-grey\r\ncorky layer, often soft enough to be removeable with the nail, and\r\nthen displaying a dark brown, resinous under surface. The inner side\r\nis light brown with a rough, slightly exfoliating surface indicating\r\nclose adhesion to the wood, strips of which are occasionally found\r\nattached to it; the obliquely cut edge also shows that it is not very\r\neasily detached. The bark has a short, resinous fracture, and displays\r\non its transverse edge sharply defined white points, due to deposite of\r\noxalate of calcium. It has a bitter taste and a nauseous musty odour.\r\n\r\n[419] Humboldt, _Reise in die Aequinoctialgegenden des neuen\r\nContinents_, iv. (Stuttgart, 1860), 252.—Humboldt and Bonpland in 1804\r\nobtaining, from the Caroni river, flowering branches of the “_Cuspa_”\r\n(_l. c._ 1. 300) or “_Cuspare_,” as it is called by the Indians,\r\nbelieved it to constitute a new genus. In 1824 St. Hilaire ascertained\r\nit to belong to the genus Galipea.\r\n\r\nThe tree is figured in Bentley and Trimen, _Med.

With the assistance of Prof. Oliver, I also have examined (1871)\r\nHancock’s plant, comparing it with his figure and other specimens,\r\nand have arrived at the conclusion that it is untenable as a distinct\r\nspecies.—D.

(1789) 154.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The most striking peculiarity is the great\r\nnumber of oil-cells scattered through the tissue of the bark. They\r\nare not much larger than the neighbouring parenchymatous cells, and\r\nare loaded with yellowish essential oil or small granules of resin.\r\nNumerous other cells contain bundles of needle-shaped crystals of\r\noxalate of calcium or small starch granules. The liber exhibits bundles\r\nof yellow fibres, to which the foliaceous fracture of the inner bark\r\nis due. The structure of the bark under notice has been very minutely\r\ndescribed and figured by Oberlin and Schlagdenhauffen.[424]\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Angostura bark owes its peculiar odour to an\r\nessential oil which it was found by Herzog[425] to yield to the extent\r\nof ¾ per cent. It is probably a mixture of a hydrocarbon (C₁₀H₁₆)\r\nwith an oxygenated oil. Its boiling point is 266° C. Oberlin and\r\nSchlagdenhauffen obtained 0·19 per cent. of the oil, and found it to\r\nbe slightly dextrogyre; it assumes a fine red colour when shaken with\r\naqueous ferric chloride, and turns yellow with concentrated sulphuric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n[424] _Journ. de Pharm. et de Chimie_, 28 (1877), 226; plates I, II,\r\nIII. The bark is also figured by Berg, _Anatomischer Atlas_, Tab. 37.\r\n\r\n[425] _Archiv d. Pharm._ xcii. (1858) 146.\r\n\r\nThe bitter taste of the bark is attributed to a substance pointed out\r\nin 1833 by Saladin and named _Cusparin_. It is said to be crystalline,\r\nneutral, melting at 45° C., soluble in alcohol, sparingly in water,\r\nprecipitable by tannic acid. The bark is stated to yield it to the\r\nextent of 1·3 per cent. Herzog endeavoured to prepare it but without\r\nsuccess, nor have Oberlin and Schlagdenhauffen met with it. The latter\r\nchemists, on the other hand, isolated an alkaloid _Angosturine_\r\nC₁₀H₄₀NO₁₄. It is in thin prisms, melting at 85° and yielding a\r\ncrystallized chlorhydrate or sulphate. Angosturine turns red when\r\ntouched with concentrated sulphuric acid, or green if nitric acid or\r\niodic acid, or other oxydizing substances, have been previously mixed\r\nwith the sulphuric acid. The alcoholic solution of the alkaloid is of\r\ndecidedly alkaline reaction. A cold aqueous infusion of angostura bark\r\nyields an abundant red-brown precipitate with ferric chloride. Thin\r\nslices of the bark are not coloured by solution of ferrous sulphate, so\r\nthat tannin appears to be absent.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Angostura bark is a valuable tonic in dyspepsia, dysentery and\r\nchronic diarrhœa, but is falling into disuse.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—About the year 1804, a quantity of a bark which proved\r\nto be that of _Strychnos Nux Vomica_ reached Europe from India, and\r\nwas mistaken for Cusparia. The error occasioned great alarm and\r\nsome accidents, and the use of angostura was in some countries even\r\nprohibited. The means of distinguishing the two barks (which are not\r\nlikely to be again confounded) are amply contained in the above-given\r\ndescriptions and tests, and at length pointed out by Oberlin and\r\nSchlagdenhauffen. They also described the bark of _Esenbeckia\r\nfebrifuga_ Martius (_Evodia febrifuga_ Saint Hilaire), a Brazilian\r\ntree belonging to the same natural order. Maisch[426] was the first\r\nto draw attention to this “_new false Angostura bark_.” It is at once\r\ndistinguished by being devoid of aromatic properties; its taste is\r\npurely bitter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLIA BUCHU.\r\n\r\n_Folia Buceo_; _Buchu_, _Bucchu_, _Bucha or Buka Leaves_; F. _Feuilles\r\nde Bucco_; G. _Bukublätter_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—The Buchu leaves are afforded by three species of\r\n_Barosma_.[427] The latter are erect shrubs some feet in height, with\r\nglabrous rod-like branches, opposite leaves furnished with conspicuous\r\noil-cells on the toothed margin as well as generally on the under\r\nsurface. The younger twigs and several parts of the flower are also\r\nprovided with oil-cells. The white flowers with 5-partite calyx, and\r\nthe fruit formed of five erect carpels, are often found, together with\r\nsmall leafy twigs, in the drug of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the three species referred to may be thus distinguished:—\r\n\r\n1. _Barosma crenulata_ Hook. (_B. crenata_ Kunze).—Oblong, oval, or\r\nobovate, obtuse, narrowed towards the base into a distinct petiole;\r\nmargin serrulate or crenulate; dimensions, ¾ to 1½ inches long, ³/₁₀ to\r\n⁴/₁₀ of an inch wide.\r\n\r\n2. _B. serratifolia_ Willd.—Linear-lanceolate, equally narrowed towards\r\neither end, three-nerved, apex truncate always furnished with an\r\noil-cell; margin sharply serrulate; 1-1½ inches long by about ²/₁₀ of\r\nan inch wide.\r\n\r\n3. _B. betulina_ Bartling.—Cuneate-obovate, apex recurved; margin\r\nsharply denticulate, teeth spreading; ½ to ¾ of an inch long by ³/₁₀\r\nto ⁵/₁₀ wide. Substance of the leaf more harsh and rigid than in the\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\n_B. crenulata_ and _B. betulina_ grow in the Divisions of Clanwilliam\r\nand Worcester, north and north-east of Cape Town, and the former even\r\non Table Mountain close to the capital; _B. serratifolia_ is found in\r\nthe Division of Swellendam farther south.\r\n\r\n=History=—The use of Buchu leaves was learnt from the Hottentots by the\r\ncolonists of the Cape of Good Hope. The first importations of the drug\r\nwere consigned to the house of Reece & Co., of London, who introduced\r\nit to the medical profession in 1821.[428] The species appears to have\r\nbeen _B. crenulata_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—In addition to the characters already pointed out, we may\r\nobserve that buchu leaves of either of the kinds mentioned are smooth\r\nand glabrous, of a dull yellowish-green hue, somewhat paler on the\r\nunder side, on which oil-cells in considerable number are perceptible.\r\n\r\n[426] _Am. Journ. of Pharm._ 1874. 50; also _Yearbook of Pharm._ 1874.\r\n91.\r\n\r\n[427] From βαρὺς, _heavy_, and ὀσμὴ, _odour_.\r\n\r\n[428] R. Reece, _Monthly Gazette of Health_ for Feb. 1821. 799.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of _B. crenulata_ vary in shape and size in different\r\nparcels, in some the leaves being larger and more elongated than\r\nin others, probably according to the luxuriance of the bushes in\r\nparticular localities. Those of _B. serratifolia_ and _B. betulina_\r\npresent but little variation. Each kind is always imported by itself.\r\nThose of _B. betulina_ are the least esteemed, and fetch a lower price\r\nthan the others, yet appear to be quite as rich in essential oil.\r\n\r\nBuchu leaves have a penetrating peculiar odour and a strongly aromatic\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The essential oil is contained in large\r\ncells close beneath the epidermis of the under side of the leaf. The\r\noil-cells are circular and surrounded by a thin layer of smaller cells;\r\nthey consequently partake of the character of the oil-ducts in the\r\naromatic roots of _Umbelliferæ_ and _Compositæ_. The latter, however,\r\nare elongated.\r\n\r\nThe upper side of the leaf of _Barosma_ exhibits an extremely\r\ninteresting peculiarity[429]. There is a colourless layer of cells\r\nseparating the epidermis from the green inner tissue (mesophyllum).\r\nIf the leaves are examined under alcohol or almond oil the colourless\r\nlayer is seen to be very narrow, and the thin walls of its cells\r\nshrunken and not clearly distinguishable. If the transverse sections\r\nare examined under water, these cells immediately swell up, and become\r\nstrongly distended, giving off an abundance of mucilage, the latter\r\nbeing afforded by the solution of the very cell-walls. The mucilage of\r\nbuchu leaves thus originates in the same way as in flax seed or quince\r\nseed, but in the former the epidermis is thrown off without alteration.\r\nWe are not aware that other mucilaginous leaves possess a similar\r\nstructure, at least not those of _Althæa officinalis_ and of _Sesamum_\r\nwhich we examined[430].\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The leaves of _B. betulina_ afforded us by\r\ndistillation 1·56 per cent, of volatile oil[431], which has the odour\r\nrather of peppermint than of buchu, and deviates the ray of polarized\r\nlight considerably to the left. On exposure to cold it furnishes a\r\ncamphor which, after re-solution in spirit of wine, crystallizes in\r\nneedle-shaped forms. After repeated purification in this manner, the\r\ncrystals of _Barosma Camphor_ have an almost pure peppermint odour;\r\nthey fuse at 85° C., and begin to sublime at 110° C. After fusion\r\nthey again solidify only at 50° C. Submitted to elementary analysis,\r\nthe crystals yielded us 74·08 per cent. of carbon and from 9 to 10\r\nper cent. of hydrogen[432]. Barosma camphor is abundantly soluble in\r\nbisulphide of carbon.\r\n\r\nThe crude oil from which the camphor has been separated has a boiling\r\npoint of about 200° C., quickly rising to 210° or even higher. That\r\nwhich distilled between these temperatures was treated with sodium,\r\nrectified in a current of common coal gas and submitted to elementary\r\nanalysis, afforded us 77·86 per cent, of carbon and 10·58 of hydrogen.\r\nThe formula C₁₀H₁₆O would require 78·94 of carbon and 10·53 of hydrogen.\r\n\r\nWayne’s experiments[433] appear to indicate that the oil also contains\r\na substance capable of being converted into _salicylic acid_. An\r\naqueous infusion of buchu leaves turns beautifully yellow if it is\r\nmixed with alkali.\r\n\r\n[429] Flückiger in _Schweiz. Wochenschrift für Pharm._ Dec. 1873, with\r\nplate.\r\n\r\n[430] See also Radlkofer, _Monographie der Sapindaceen-Gattung\r\nSerjania_, München, 1875, p. 100-105.\r\n\r\n[431] Messrs. Allen and Hanburys operating on larger quantities\r\nobtained 1.63 per cent.—_Barosma serratifolia_ appears to be less rich,\r\naccording to Bedford (1863).\r\n\r\n[432] Our supply of the substance having been exhausted by two analyses\r\nwe cannot regard the above figures as sufficient for the calculation of\r\na formula.\r\n\r\n[433] _Am. Journ. of Pharm._ 1876. 19.\r\n\r\nOn addition of perchloride of iron the infusion assumes a dingy\r\nbrownish-green colour changing to red by an alkali. The infusion\r\nadded to a concentrated solution of acetate of copper causes a yellow\r\nprecipitate[434] which dissolves in caustic potash, affording a green\r\nsolution. This may be due to the presence of a substance of the\r\nquercitrin or rutin class.\r\n\r\nWhen the leaves are infused in warm water, the mucilage noticed under\r\nthe microscope may easily be pressed out. It requires for precipitation\r\na large amount of alcohol, being readily miscible with dilute alcohol.\r\nNeutral acetate of lead produces a yellow precipitate in an infusion of\r\nthe leaves; the liquid affords a precipitate by a subsequent addition\r\nof _basic_ acetate of lead. The latter precipitate is (probably) due to\r\nthe mucilage, that afforded by neutral acetate partly to mucilage and\r\npartly, we suppose, to rutin or an allied substance. Yet the mucilage\r\nof buchu leaves is of the class which is not properly dissolved by\r\nwater, but only swells up like tragacanth.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of _B. crenulata_ afforded us upon incineration 4·7 per\r\ncent. of ash. Jones (1879) obtained on an average 4·54 per cent. from\r\nthe same species; 5·27 from _B. serratifolia_; and 4·49 from _B.\r\nbetulina_. He pointed out the presence of manganate in this ash.\r\n\r\nThe _Diosmin_ of Landerer[435] is entirely unknown to us.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The export of buchu from the Cape Colony in 1872 was 379,125\r\nlb., about one-sixth of which quantity was shipped direct to the United\r\nStates.[436]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Buchu is principally administered in disorders of the\r\nurino-genital organs. It is reputed diuretic and diaphoretic. In\r\nthe Cape Colony the leaves are much employed as a popular stimulant\r\nand stomachic, infused in water, sherry, or brandy. They are also\r\nextensively used in the United States, both in regular medicine and by\r\nthe vendors of secret remedies.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—The leaves of _Empleurum serrulatum_ Ait., a small shrub\r\nof the same order as _Barosma_ and growing in the same localities,\r\nhave been imported rather frequently of late and sold as _Buchu_. They\r\nhave the same structure as regards mucilage, and nearly the same form\r\nas those of _B. serratifolia_, but are easily distinguished. They are\r\nstill narrower, and often longer than those of _B. serratifolia_,\r\ndevoid of lateral veins, and terminate in an _acute_ point _without an\r\noil-duct_. They have a bitterish taste and a less powerful odour than\r\nthose of Barosma, even in fresh leaves as imported in London. The odour\r\nof _Empleurum_ is moreover distinctly different from that of the leaves\r\nof Barosma. The flowers of _Empleurum_ are still more distinct, for\r\nthey are apetalous and reddish-brown. The fruit consisting of a single,\r\ncompressed, oblong carpel, terminated by a flat-shaped horn, is quite\r\nunlike that of buchu.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of _Barosma Eckloniana_ Berg (regarded by Sonder[437] as\r\na form of _B. crenulata_) have to our knowledge been imported on one\r\noccasion (1873). They are nearly an inch long, oval, _rounded at the\r\nbase_, strongly crenate, and grow from _pubescent_ shoots.\r\n\r\n[434] It seems _green_ as long as it is in the blue cupric liquid.\r\n\r\n[435] Gmelin’s _Chemistry_, xviii 194.\r\n\r\n[436] _Blue Book_ published at Cape Town, 1873.\r\n\r\n[437] Harvey and Sonder, _Flora Capensis_, i. (1859-60) 393.\r\n\r\nWe have seen other leaves which had been imported from South Africa and\r\noffered as buchu; but though probably derived from allied genera they\r\nwere not to be mistaken for the genuine drug.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX TODDALIÆ.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Toddalia aculeata_ Pers., a ramous prickly\r\nbush,[438] often climbing over the highest trees, common in the\r\nsouthern parts of the Indian peninsula as the Coromandel Coast, South\r\nConcans, and Canara, also found in Ceylon, Mauritius, the Indian\r\nArchipelago and Southern China.\r\n\r\n=History=—The pungent aromatic properties which pervade the plant,\r\nbut especially the fresh root-bark, are well known to the natives of\r\nIndia and have been utilized in their medical practice. They have also\r\nattracted the attention of Europeans, and the root of the plant is now\r\nrecognized in the _Pharmacopœia of India_.\r\n\r\nIt is from this and other species of _Toddalia_, or from the allied\r\ngenus _Zanthoxylum_,[439] that a drug is derived which under the name\r\nof _Lopez Root_ had once some celebrity in Europe. This drug which was\r\nmore precisely termed _Radix Indica Lopeziana_ or _Root of Juan Lopez\r\nPigneiro_, was first made known by the Italian physician Redi,[440]\r\nwho described it in 1671 from specimens obtained by Pigneiro at the\r\nmouth of the river Zambesi in Eastern Africa,—the very locality in\r\nwhich in our times _Toddalia lanceolata_ Lam. has been collected by\r\nDr. Kirk.[441] It was actually introduced into European medicine by\r\nGaubius[442] in 1771 as a remedy for diarrhœa, and acquired so much\r\nreputation that it was admitted to the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia of 1792.\r\nThe root appears to have been sometimes imported from Goa, but its\r\nplace of growth and botanical origin were entirely unknown, and it was\r\nalways extremely rare and costly.[443] It has long been obsolete in all\r\ncountries except Holland, where until recently it was to be met with in\r\nthe shops. The _Pharmacopœia Neerlandica_ of 1851 says of it “_Origo\r\nbotanica perquam dubia—Patria Malacca?_”\r\n\r\n[438] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, part 18.\r\n\r\n[439] The root of a _Zanthoxylum_ sent to us from Java by Mr. Binnendyk\r\nof the Buitenzorg Botanical Garden has exactly the aspect of that of\r\n_Toddalia_. The root of _Z. Bungei_ which we have examined in the fresh\r\nstate is also completely similar. It is covered with a soft, corky,\r\nyellow bark having a very bitter taste with a strong pungency like that\r\nof pellitory.\r\n\r\n[440] _Esperienze intorno a diverse cote naturali_, Firenze, 1671. 121.\r\n\r\n[441] Oliver, _Flor. of Trop. Africa_, i. (1868) 307.\r\n\r\n[442] _Adversaria_, Leidae, p. 78.\r\n\r\n[443] Our friend Dr. de Vry informs us that he remembers the price in\r\nHolland in 1828 being equivalent to about 24_s._ the ounce!\r\n\r\n=Description=—The specimen of the root of _Toddalia aculeata_ which\r\nwe have examined was collected for us by Dr. G. Bidie of Madras whose\r\nstatements regarding the stimulant and tonic action of the drug may\r\nbe found in the _Pharmacopœia of India_, p. 442. It is a dense woody\r\nroot in cylindrical, flexuous pieces, which have evidently been of\r\nconsiderable length and are from ½ to 1½ inches in diameter, covered\r\nwith bark ⅒ to ¹/₁₂ of an inch in thickness. The bark has a soft,\r\ndull yellowish, suberous coat, wrinkled longitudinally, beneath which\r\nis a very thin layer of a bright yellow colour, and still lower and\r\nconstituting two-thirds or more of the whole, is the firm, brown middle\r\ncortical layer and liber, which is the part chiefly possessing the\r\ncharacteristic pungency and bitterness of the drug. The yellow corky\r\ncoat is however not devoid of bitterness. The wood is hard, of a pale\r\nyellow, and without taste and smell. The pores of the wood, which\r\nare rather large, are arranged in concentric order and traversed by\r\nnumerous narrow medullary rays.\r\n\r\nIn a letter which Frappier[444] wrote to Guibourt from the island of\r\nRéunion where _Toddalia aculeata_ is very common, he states that the\r\nroots of the plant are of enormous length (_longueur incroyable_) and\r\nrather difficult to get out of the basaltic rock into the fissures of\r\nwhich they penetrate. Mr. J. Horne of the Botanical Garden, Mauritius,\r\nhas sent us a specimen of the root of this plant, the bark of which is\r\nof a dusky brown, with the suberous layer but little developed.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—We have examined the root for which we are\r\nindebted to Dr. Bidie, and may state that its cortical tissue is\r\nremarkable by the number of large cells filled with resin and essential\r\noil; they are scattered through the whole tissue, the cork excepted.\r\nThe parenchymatous cells are loaded with small starch granules or with\r\ncrystals of oxalate of calcium. The vessels of younger roots abound in\r\nyellow resin.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—None of the constituents of the Toddalia root\r\nof India have yet been satisfactorily examined. The bark contains an\r\nessential oil, which would be better extracted from fresh than from\r\ndry material. The tissue of the bark is but little coloured by salts\r\nof iron. In the aqueous infusion, tannic acid produces an abundant\r\nprecipitate, probably of an indifferent bitter principle rather than of\r\nan alkaloid. We have been unable to detect the presence in the bark of\r\nberberine.\r\n\r\nLopez root was examined in Wittstein’s laboratory by Schnitzer[445]\r\nwho found that the bark contains in addition to the usual substances a\r\nlarge proportion of resin,—a mixture probably of two or three different\r\nbodies. The essential oil afforded by the bark had an odour resembling\r\ncinnamon and melissa.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The drug has been introduced into the _Pharmacopœia of India_\r\nchiefly upon the recommendation of Dr. Bidie of Madras, who considers\r\nit of great value as a stimulating tonic. The bark rasped or shaved\r\nfrom the woody root is the only part that should be used.\r\n\r\n[444] _Journ. de Phar._ v. (1867) 403.\r\n\r\n[445] Wittstein’s _Vierteljahresschrift für prakt. Pharm._ xi. (1862)\r\ni.—The drug examined was the Lopez root sold at that period at\r\nAmsterdam.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLIA PILOCARPI.\r\n\r\n_Folia Jaborandi_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Pilocarpus pennatifolius_[446] Lemaire, a slightly\r\nbranched shrub, attaining about 10 feet in height. It is distributed\r\nthrough the eastern provinces of Brazil.\r\n\r\n_Pilocarpus Selloanus_[447] Engler, occurring in Southern Brazil\r\nand Paraguay, appears to be not considerably different from _P.\r\npennatifolius_.\r\n\r\n=History=—Piso[448] recommended an infusion made with Ipecacuanha and\r\nJaborandi. Plumier,[449] who also mentioned this, figured under the\r\nname of Jaborandi two plants of the order Piperaceæ. The introduction\r\nof the leaves of _Pilocarpus pennatifolius_ into medical use is due\r\nto Dr. Coutinho of Pernambuco, 1874. The plant has been cultivated in\r\nEuropean greenhouses since about the year 1847; we have repeatedly\r\nseen it flowering at Strassburg. Baillon in 1875 showed the fragments\r\nof Jaborandi as supplied by Coutinho to belong to _P. pennatifolius_,\r\nwhich had been described in 1852 by Lemaire. Holmes (1875) in examining\r\nthe drug as imported from Pernambuco came to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The leaves of the species under examination are\r\nlong-stalked, imparipennate, the opposite leaflets in 2 to 5, in\r\ncultivated plants most commonly in 2 pairs, the terminal one longer\r\nstalked, while the others are provided with a petiole attaining 1½\r\ninch in length or remaining much shorter. The whole leaf is frequently\r\n1½ feet long, the leaflets being often as much as 5 inches long by 2\r\ninches wide. The latter are entire oblong, tapering or rounded at the\r\nbase, tapering or obtuse or even emarginate at the apex. The leaflets\r\nare coriaceous, with a slightly revolute margin and a prominent midrib\r\nbelow. In transmitted light they show very numerous pellucid oil-glands.\r\n\r\nThe taste of the leaves of Pilocarpus is at first bitterish and\r\naromatic; they subsequently produce a tingling sensation in the mouth\r\nand an abundant flow of saliva.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=[450]—The oil-glands consist of large cells\r\nof the same structure as those occurring generally in the leaves\r\nof Rutaceæ, Aurantiaceæ, Myrtaceæ. In Pilocarpus they are largely\r\ndistributed in the tissue covered on both sides of the leaf by the\r\nepidermis; the oil-cells are also abundantly met with in the petiole\r\nand in the bark of the stems and branches.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The active principle of Jaborandi is the\r\nalkaloid _Pilocarpine_, C₂₃H₃₅N₄O₄ + 4OH₂, discovered in 1875 by\r\nHardy. It is an amorphous soft mass, but yielding crystallized salts,\r\namong which the hydrochlorate and the nitrate are now more frequently\r\nused than the drug itself. The leaves afford about ½ per cent. of the\r\nnitrate.\r\n\r\n[446] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med. Plants_, part 32 (1878).\r\n\r\n[447] Fig. by Engler in _Flora Brasil_. fasc. 65 (1874) tab. 30.\r\n_Pilocarpus pauciflorus_ St. Hilaire (_Flora Brasiliæ meridionalis_, i.\r\n1824. tab. 17) appears also to be very similar.\r\n\r\n[448] Lib. iv. cap. 57, 59, and v. cap. 19, p. 310, of the work quoted\r\nin the appendix.\r\n\r\n[449] _Description des Plantes de l’Amérique_, 1693. 58.

(1878) 253.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of another peculiar alkaloid in Pilocarpus has been\r\nasserted, but not ultimately proved.\r\n\r\nThe leaves contain about ½ per cent. of essential oil, the prevailing\r\nconstituent of it being a dextrogyrate terpene, C₁₀H₁₆, boiling at\r\n178°, which forms a crystallized compound C₁₀H₁₆ + 2HCl melting at\r\n49°·5 C.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Pilocarpine being a powerful diaphoretic and sialagogue,\r\nthe leaves of Jaborandi are used to some extent in pharmaceutical\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\n=Other Kinds of Jaborandi=—This name, as above stated, has originally\r\nbeen given to plants of the order Piperaceæ, some of which are still\r\nknown in Brazil under the name Jaborandi. The following may be quoted\r\nas being used at least in that country: _Serronia Jaborandi_[451]\r\nGaudichaud, _Piper reticulatum_ L. (_Enckea_ Miquel), _Piper\r\ncitrifolium_ Lamarck (_Steffensia_ Kunth), _Piper nodulosum_ Link,\r\n_Artanthe mollicoma_ Miq.\r\n\r\n_Aubletia trifolia_[452] Richard (_Monniera_ L.) and _Xanthoxylum\r\nelegans_ Engler, belonging to the same order as Pilocarpus itself, are\r\nalso sometimes called Jaborandi.\r\n\r\nWe are not aware that other leaves than those of Pilocarpus are\r\nimported to some extent in Europe under the name of Jaborandi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAURANTIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS LIMONIS.\r\n\r\n_Lemon_; F. _Citron_, _Limon_; G. _Citrone_, _Limone_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Citrus Limonum_ Risso (_C. Medica_ var. β Linn.), a\r\nsmall tree 10 to 15 feet in height, planted here and there in gardens\r\nin many subtropical countries, but cultivated as an object of industry\r\non the Mediterranean coast between Nice and Genoa, in Calabria, Sicily,\r\nSpain, and Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe tree which is supposed to represent the wild state of the lemon and\r\nlime, and as it seems to us after the examination of numerous specimens\r\nin the herbarium of Kew, of the citron (_Citrus Medica_ Risso) also,\r\nis a native of the forests of Northern India, where it occurs in the\r\nvalleys of Kumaon and Sikkim.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated lemon-tree is of rather irregular growth, with foliage\r\nsomewhat pallid, sparse, and uneven, not forming the fine, close head\r\nof deep green that is so striking in the orange tree. The young shoots\r\nare of a dull purple; the flowers, which are produced all the year\r\nexcept during the winter, and are in part hermaphrodite and in part\r\nunisexual, have the corolla externally purplish; internally white, and\r\na delicate aroma distinct from that of orange blossom. The fruit is\r\npale yellow, ovoid, usually crowned by a nipple.\r\n\r\n[451] Already known to Piso.\r\n\r\n[452] The original Jaborandi of Piso, according to Peckolt.\r\nDragendorff’s _Jahresbericht_, 1875. 163.\r\n\r\n=History=—The name of the lemon in Sanskrit is _Nimbuka_; in\r\nHindustani, _Limbu_, _Limu_, or _Ninbu_. It is probably originally a\r\nCashmere word, which was transferred to the Sanskrit in comparatively\r\nmodern times, not in the antiquity.[453] From these sounds the Arabians\r\nformed the word _Limun_, which has passed into the languages of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe lemon was unknown to the inhabitants of ancient Greece and Rome;\r\nbut it is mentioned in the Book of Nabathæan Agriculture,[454] which\r\nis supposed to date from the 3rd or 4th century of our era. The\r\nintroduction of the tree to Europe is due to the Arabians, yet at\r\nwhat precise period is somewhat doubtful. _Arance_ and _Limone_ are\r\nmentioned by an Arabic poet living in the 11th century, in Sicily,\r\nquoted by Falcando.[455] The geographer Edrisi,[456] who resided at the\r\ncourt of Roger II., king of Sicily, in the middle of the 12th century,\r\nmentions the lemon (_limouna_) as a very sour fruit of the size of an\r\napple which was one of the productions of Mansouria on the Mahrân or\r\nIndus; and he speaks of it in a manner that leads one to infer it was\r\nnot then known in Europe. This is the more probable from the fact that\r\nthere is no mention either of lemon or orange in a letter written A.D.\r\n1239 concerning the cultivation of the lands of the Emperor Frederick\r\nII. at Palermo,[457] a locality in which these fruits are now produced\r\nin large quantity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the lemon is noticed at great length by Ibn Baytar\r\nof Malaga, who flourished in the first half of the 13th century,\r\nbut of its cultivation in Spain at that period there is no actual\r\nmention.[458] In 1369 at least citron trees, “arbores citronorum,”\r\nwere planted in Genoa,[459] and there is evidence that also the\r\nlemon-tree was grown on the Riviera di Ponente about the middle of the\r\n15th century, since _Limones_ and also _Citri_ are mentioned in the\r\nmanuscript _Livre d’Administration_ of the city of Savona, under date\r\n1486.[460] The lemon was cultivated as early as 1494 in the Azores,\r\nwhence the fruit used to be largely shipped to England; but since the\r\nyear 1838 the exportation has totally ceased.[461]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit of _Citrus Limonum_ as found in the shops[462]\r\nis from about 2 to 4 inches in length, egg-shaped with a nipple more\r\nor less prominent at the apex; its surface, of a pale yellow, is even\r\nor rugged, covered with a polished epidermis. The parenchyme within\r\nthe latter abounds in large cells filled with fragrant essential oil.\r\nThe roughness of the surface of the rind is due to the oil-cells. The\r\npeel, which varies considerably in thickness but is never so thick as\r\nthat of the citron, is internally white and fibrous, and is adherent\r\nto the pale yellow pulp. The latter is divided into 10 or 12 segments\r\neach containing 2 or 3 seeds. It abounds in a pale yellow acid juice\r\nhaving a pleasant sour taste and a slight peculiar odour quite distinct\r\nfrom that of the peel. When removed from the pulp by pressure, the\r\njuice appears as a rather turbid yellowish fluid having a sp. gr. which\r\nvaries from 1·040 to 1·045, and containing in each fluid ounce from 40\r\nto 46 grains of citric acid, or about 9½ per cent.[463] In Italy all\r\nthe fine and perfect fruit is exported; the windfalls and the damaged\r\nfruit are used for the production of the essential oil and the juice.\r\nAbout 13,000 lemons of this kind yield one pipe (108 gallons) of raw\r\njuice. Sicilian juice in November will contain about 9 ounces of citric\r\nacid per gallon, but 6 ounces when afforded by the fruit collected in\r\nApril. The juice is boiled down in copper vessels, over an open fire,\r\ntill its specific gravity is about 1·239.[464] Lemon juice (_Succus\r\nlimonis_) for administration as a medicine should be pressed as wanted\r\nfrom the recent fruit whenever the latter is obtainable.\r\n\r\n[453] Dr. Rice in _New Remedies_, 1878, 263; also private information.\r\n\r\n[454] Meyer, _Geschichte der Botanik_, iii.

The inner spongy tissue is built up\r\nof very remarkable branched cells, separated by large intercellular\r\nspaces. A solution of iodine in iodide of potassium imparts to the\r\ncell-walls a transient blue coloration. The outer layers of the\r\nparenchymatous tissue contain numerous yellowish lumps of a substance\r\nwhich assumes a brownish hue by iodine, and yields a yellow solution\r\nif potash be added. Alkaline tartrate of copper is reduced by this\r\nsubstance, which probably consists of hesperidin. There also occur\r\nlarge crystals of oxalate of calcium, belonging to the monoclinic\r\nsystem. The interior tissue is irregularly traversed by small vascular\r\nbundles.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The peel of the lemon abounds in essential\r\noil, which is a distinct article of commerce, and will be described\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nLemons, as well as other fruits of the genus _Citrus_, contain a bitter\r\nprinciple, _Hesperidin_, of which E. Hoffmann[465] obtained 5 to 8\r\nper cent. from unripe bitter oranges. He extracted them with dilute\r\nalcohol, after they had previously been exhausted by cold water. The\r\nalcohol should contain about 1 per cent. of caustic potash; the liquid\r\non cooling is acidulated with hydrochloric acid, when it yields a\r\nyellowish crystalline deposit of hesperidin, which may be obtained\r\ncolourless and tasteless by recrystallization from boiling alcohol. By\r\ndilute sulphuric acid (1 per cent.) hesperidin is broken up as follows:—\r\n\r\n     C₂₂H₂₆O₁₂   =   C₁₆H₁₄O₆   +  C₆H₁₂O₆.\r\n    Hesperidin.    Hesperetin.    Glucose.\r\n\r\nHesperidin is very little soluble even in boiling water or in ether,\r\nbut dissolves readily in hot acetic acid, also in alkaline solutions,\r\nthe latter then turning soon yellow and reddish. Pure hesperidin, as\r\npresented to one of us by Hoffmann, darkens when it is shaken with\r\nalcoholic perchloride of iron, and turns dingy blackish brown when\r\ngently warmed with the latter.\r\n\r\n[465] _Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft_ (1876) 26, 685,\r\n693.\r\n\r\n_Hesperetin_ forms crystals melting at 223° C., soluble both in alcohol\r\nor ether, not in water; they taste sweet. They are split up by potash\r\nin Phloroglucin and _Hesperetic acid_, C₁₀H₁₀O₄.\r\n\r\nOn addition of ferric chloride, thin slices of the peel are darkened,\r\nowing probably to some derivative of hesperidin, or to hesperidin\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe name hesperidin had also been applied to _yellow_ crystals\r\nextracted from the shaddock, _Citrus decumana_ L., the dried flowers\r\nof which afford about 2 per cent. of that substance. It is, as\r\nshown in 1879 by E. Hoffmann, quite different from hesperidin as\r\ndescribed above; he calls it _Naringin_ and assigns to it the formula\r\nC₂₃H₂₆O₁₂+4OH₂. Naringin is readily soluble in hot water or in alcohol,\r\nnot in ether or chloroform. Its solutions turn brown-red on addition of\r\nferric chloride.\r\n\r\nLemon juice, some of the characters of which have been already noticed,\r\nis an important article in a dietetic point of view, being largely\r\nconsumed on shipboard for the prevention of scurvy. In addition to\r\ncitric acid it contains 3 to 4 per cent. of gum and sugar, and 2·28 per\r\ncent. of inorganic salts, of which according to Stoddart only a minute\r\nproportion is potash. Cossa[466] on the other hand, who has recently\r\nstudied the products of the lemon tree with much care, has found that\r\nthe ash of dried lemon juice contains 54 per cent. of potash, besides\r\n15 per cent. of phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nStoddart has pointed out the remarkable tendency of citric acid to\r\nundergo decomposition,[467] and has proved that in lemons kept from\r\nFebruary to July this acid generally decreases in quantity, at first\r\nslowly, but afterwards rapidly, until at the end of the period it\r\nentirely ceases to exist, having been all split up into glucose and\r\ncarbonic acid. At the same time the sp. gr. of the juice was found to\r\nhave undergone but slight diminution:—thus it was 1·044 in February,\r\n1·041 in May, and 1·027 in July, and the fruit had hardly altered in\r\nappearance. Lemon juice may with some precautions be kept unimpaired\r\nfor months or even years. Yet it is capable of undergoing fermentation\r\nby reason of the sugar, gum, and albuminoid matters which it contains.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Lemons are chiefly imported from Sicily, to a smaller extent\r\nfrom the Riviera of Genoa and from Spain. From the published statistics\r\nof trade, in which lemons are classed together with oranges under one\r\nhead, it appears that these fruits are being imported in increasing\r\nquantities. The value of the shipments to the United Kingdom in 1872\r\n(largely exceeding those of any previous year) was £1,154,270. Of this\r\nsum, £986,796 represents the value of the oranges and lemons imported\r\nfrom Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands and Azores; £155,330 the\r\nshipments of the same fruit from Italy; and £3,825 those from Malta.\r\n\r\nOf concentrated _lemon juice_ there were exported in 1877 from\r\nMessina 1,631,332 kilogrammes, valued at 2,446,996 lire. The value of\r\nconcentrated _lime juice_ exported in 1874 from Montserrat was £3,390.\r\nFrom Dominica, 11,285 gallons, value £1,825, were shipped in 1875.\r\n\r\n[466] _Gazetta Chimica Italiana_, ii. (1872) 385; _Journ. of Chem.\r\nSoc._ xi (1873) 402.\r\n\r\n[467] Stoddart’s statement that if potash be added to lemon juice,\r\n_oxalic acid_ may be detected in the mixture after a few days, is not\r\nsupported by our observations.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Lemon peel is used in medicine solely as a flavouring\r\ningredient. Freshly prepared lemon juice is often administered with an\r\nalkaline bicarbonate in the form of an effervescing draught, or in a\r\nfree state.\r\n\r\nConcentrated _lemon juice_ is imported for the purpose of making citric\r\nacid; it is derived not only from the lemon, but also, to a smaller\r\nextent, from the lime and bergamot. _Lime juice_ of the West Indies is\r\nchiefly used as a beverage; small quantities of it are also exported\r\nfor the manufacture of citric acid. The culture of _Citrus Limetta_\r\nRisso, the _lime_, was introduced in Montserrat in 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLEUM LIMONIS.\r\n\r\n_Oleum Limonum_; _Essential Oil or Essence of Lemon_; F. _Essence de\r\nCitron_; G. _Citronenöl_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Citrus Limonum_ Risso (see p. 114).\r\n\r\n=History=—The chemists of the 16th century were well acquainted with\r\nthe method of extracting essential oils by distillation. Besson in\r\nhis work _L’art et moyen parfaict de tirer huyles et eaux de tous\r\nmedicaments simples et oleogineux_, published at Paris in 1571,\r\nmentions _lemon_-(citron) and orange-peel among the substances\r\nsubjected to this process. Giovanni Battista Porta,[468] a learned\r\nNeapolitan writer, describes the method of preparing _Oleum ex\r\ncorticibus Citri_ to consist in removing the peel of the fruit with\r\na rasp and distilling it so comminuted with water; and adds that the\r\noils of lemon and orange may be obtained in the same manner. Essence\r\nof lemon of two kinds, namely _expressed_ and _distilled_, was sold in\r\nParis in the time of Pomet, 1692.\r\n\r\n=Production=—Essential oil of lemon is manufactured in Sicily, at\r\nReggio in Calabria, and at Mentone and Nice in France.\r\n\r\nThe lemons are used while still rather green and unripe, as being\r\nricher in oil than when quite mature. Only the small and irregular\r\nfruit, such as is not worth exporting, is employed for affording the\r\nessence.\r\n\r\nThe process followed in Sicily and Calabria may be thus described;[469]\r\nit is performed in the months of November and December.\r\n\r\n[468] _Magiæ Naturalis libri xx._ Neapoli. 1589. 188.\r\n\r\n[469] Through the kindness of Signor Mallandrino of Giampilieri near\r\nMessina, I had the pleasure of seeing how the essence is made. Though\r\nthe time of my visit (13 May 1872) was not that of the manufacture,\r\nSignor M. sent for one of his workmen, and having procured a few\r\nlemons, set him to work on them in order that I might have ocular\r\ndemonstration of the process.—D. H.\r\n\r\nThe workman first cuts off the peel in _three_ thick longitudinal\r\nslices, leaving the central pulp of a three-cornered shape with a\r\nlittle peel at either end. This central pulp he cuts transversely in\r\nthe middle, throwing it on one side and the pieces of peel on the\r\nother. The latter are allowed to remain till the next day and are then\r\ntreated thus: the workman seated holds in the palm of his left hand a\r\nflattish piece of sponge, wrapping it round his forefinger. With the\r\nother he places on the sponge one of the slices of peel, the outer\r\nsurface downwards, and then presses the zest-side (which is uppermost)\r\nso as to give it for the moment a convex instead of a concave form.\r\nThe vesicles are thus ruptured, and the oil which issues from them is\r\nreceived in the sponge with which they are in contact. Four or five\r\nsqueezes are all the workman gives to each slice of peel, which done\r\nhe throws it aside. Though each bit of peel has attached to it a small\r\nportion of pulp, the workman contrives to avoid pressing the latter.\r\nAs the sponge gets saturated the workman wrings it forcibly, receiving\r\nits contents in a coarse earthen bowl provided with a spout; in this\r\nrude vessel, which is capable of holding at least three pints, the\r\noil separates from the watery liquid which accompanies it and is then\r\ndecanted.\r\n\r\nThe yield is stated to be very variable, 400 fruits affording 9 to 14\r\nounces of essence. The prisms of pulp and the exhausted pieces of peel\r\nare submitted to pressure in order to extract from them lemon juice,\r\nand are said to be also subjected to distillation. The foregoing is\r\ntermed the _sponge-process_; it is also applied to the orange. It\r\nappears rude and wasteful, but when honestly performed it yields an\r\nexcellent product.\r\n\r\nEssence of lemon is prepared at Mentone and Nice by a different method.\r\nThe object being to set free and to collect the oil contained in the\r\nvesicles of the peel, an apparatus is employed, which may be thus\r\ndescribed:—a stout saucer or shallow basin of pewter, about 8½ inches\r\nin diameter with a lip on one side for convenience of pouring. Fixed\r\nin the bottom of this saucer are a number of stout, sharp, brass pins,\r\nstanding up about half an inch; the centre of the bottom is deepened\r\ninto a tube about an inch in diameter and five inches in length, closed\r\nat its lower end. This vessel, which is called an _écuelle à piquer_,\r\nhas therefore some resemblance to a shallow, dish-shaped funnel, the\r\ntube of which is closed below.\r\n\r\nThe workman takes a lemon in the hand, and rubs it over the sharp pins,\r\nturning it round so that the oil-vessels of the entire surface may be\r\npunctured. The essential oil which is thus liberated is received in the\r\nsaucer whence it flows down into the tube; and as this latter becomes\r\nfilled, it is poured into another vessel that it may separate from\r\nthe turbid aqueous liquid that accompanies it. It is finally filtered\r\nand is then known as _Essence de Citron au zeste_. A small additional\r\nproduce is sometimes obtained by immersing the scarified lemons in warm\r\nwater and separating the oil which floats off.\r\n\r\nA second kind of essence termed _Essence de Citron distillée_ is\r\nobtained by rubbing the surface of fresh lemons, or of those which have\r\nbeen submitted to the process just described, on a coarse grater of\r\ntinned iron, by which the portion of peel richest in essential oil is\r\nremoved. This grated peel is subjected to distillation with water, and\r\nyields a colourless essence of very inferior fragrance, which is sold\r\nat a low price.\r\n\r\n=Description=[470]—The oil obtained by the sponge-process and that of\r\nthe _écuelle à piquer_ are mobile liquids of a faint yellow colour, of\r\nexquisite fragrance and bitterish aromatic taste.\r\n\r\n[470] For specimens of the _Essence au zeste_ and of the _Essence\r\ndistillée_ of guaranteed purity we have to thank M. Médecin, distiller\r\nof essences, Mentone; and Messrs. G. Pannucio e figli, for an authentic\r\nsample of the essence made by the sponge process in their establishment\r\nat Reggio. We have also had a small quantity prepared by the _écuelle_\r\nby one of ourselves near Mentone, 15th June 1872.—D. H.\r\n\r\nThe different specimens which we have examined are readily miscible\r\nwith bisulphide of carbon, but dissolve sparingly in spirit of wine\r\n(0·830). An equal weight of the oil and of spirit of wine forms a\r\nturbid mixture. No peculiar coloration is produced by mixture with\r\nperchloride of iron.\r\n\r\nThe oils are dextrogyre, but differ in their rotatory power, as may be\r\nillustrated by the following results, which we obtained by examining\r\nthem in a column 50 millimetres long in the polaristrobometer of\r\nWild. The oil of Signori Panuccio, due to the sponge-process (p. 118,\r\nnote 2), deviated 20·9°, that of Monsieur Médecin (_Essence de Citron\r\nau zeste_) obtained by the _éculle à piquer_ deviated 33·4° and his\r\ndistilled oil 28·3°.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The prevailing portion of most essential oils\r\nof the _Aurantiaceæ_ agrees with the formula C₁₀H₁₆; the differences\r\nwhich they exhibit chiefly concern their optical properties, odour, and\r\ncolour. The boiling point mostly varies from about 170° to 180° C., the\r\nsp. gr. between 0·83 and 0·88. These oils are a mixture of isomeric\r\nhydrocarbons, and also contain a small amount of cymene, C₁₀H₁₄, and of\r\noxygenated oils, not yet well known; of these we may infer the presence\r\neither from analytical results or simply from the fact that the crude\r\noils are altered by metallic sodium. If they are purified by repeated\r\nrectification over that metal, they are finally no longer altered by\r\nit. Oils thus purified cease to possess their original fragrance, and\r\noften resemble oil of turpentine, with which they agree in composition\r\nand general chemical behaviour.\r\n\r\nAs to essential oil of lemons, its chief constituent is the terpene,\r\nC₁₀H₁₆, which, like oil of turpentine, easily yields crystals of\r\nterpin, C₁₀H₁₆ 3OH₂. There is further present, according to Tilden\r\n(1879) another hydrocarbon, C₁₀H₁₆, which already boils at 160° C.,\r\nwhereas the foregoing boils at 176° C. Lastly a small amount of cymene\r\nand of a compound acetic ether, C₂H₃O(C₁₀H₁₇O), would appear to occur\r\nalso in oil of lemons. The crude oil of lemons already yields the\r\ncrystalline compound C₁₀H₁₆ + 2HCl, when saturated with anhydrous\r\nhydrochloric gas, whereas by the same treatment oil of turpentine\r\naffords the solid compound C₁₀H₁₆ + HCl.\r\n\r\nEssential oil of lemons (not the distilled) when long kept deposits a\r\ngreasy mass, from which we have obtained small crystals apparently of\r\n_Bergaptene_ (p. 123).\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Essence of lemons is shipped chiefly from Messina and\r\nPalermo, packed in copper bottles called in Italian _ramiere_ and by\r\nEnglish druggists “_jars_” holding 25 to 50 kilo. or more; sometimes in\r\ntin bottles of smaller size. The quantity of essences of lemon, orange\r\nand bergamot exported from Sicily in 1871 was 368,800 lb., valued at\r\n£144,520, of which about two-thirds were shipped to England.[471]\r\nIn 1877 the export of these essential oils from Messina amounted to\r\n306,948 kilogrammes, valued at 6,130,960 lire.\r\n\r\n[471] Consul Dennis, _On the Commerce, &c. of Sicily in 1869, 1870,\r\n1871_. _Reports from H.M.

In fact it is stated that almost all that\r\ncomes into the market is more or less diluted with oil of turpentine\r\nor with the cheaper _distilled_ oil of lemons. Manufacturers of the\r\nessence complain that the demand for a cheap article forces them to\r\nthis falsification of their product.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLEUM BERGAMOTTÆ.\r\n\r\n_Oleum Bergamii_; _Essence or Essential Oil of Bergamot_; F. _Essence\r\nde Bergamotte_; G. _Bergamottöl_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Citrus Bergamia_ var. _vulgaris_ Risso et\r\nPoiteau,[472] a small tree closely resembling in flowers and foliage\r\nthe Bitter Orange. Its fruit is 2½ to 3 inches in diameter, nearly\r\nspherical, or slightly pear-shaped, frequently crowned by the\r\npersistent style; it is of a pale golden yellow like a lemon,[473] with\r\nthe peel smooth and thin, abounding in essential oil of a peculiar\r\nfragrance; the pulp is pale yellowish green, of a bitterish taste, and\r\nfar less acid than that of the lemon.\r\n\r\nThe tree is cultivated at Reggio in Calabria, and is unknown in a wild\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n=History=—The bergamot is one of the cultivated forms which abound in\r\nthe genus _Citrus_, and which constitute the innumerable varieties of\r\nthe orange, lemon and citron. Whether it is most nearly related to the\r\nlemon or to the orange is a point discussed as early as the beginning\r\nof the last century. Gallesio[474] remarks that it so evidently\r\ncombines the characters of the two that it should be regarded as a\r\nhybrid between them. The bergamot first appeared in the latter part\r\nof the 17th century. It is not mentioned in the grand work on orange\r\ntrees of Ferrari,[475] published at Rome in 1646, nor in the treatise\r\nof Commelyn[476] (1676), nor in the writings of Lanzoni (1690),[477]\r\nor La Quintinie (1692).[478] So far as we know, it is first noticed\r\nin a little book called _Le Parfumeur François_, printed at Lyons in\r\n1693. The author who calls himself _Le Sieur Barbe, parfumeur_, says\r\nthat the _Essence de Cedra ou Bergamotte_ is obtained from the fruits\r\nof a lemon-tree which has been grafted on the stem of a bergamot pear;\r\nhe adds that it is got by squeezing small bits of the peel with the\r\nfingers in a bottle or globe large enough to allow the hand to enter.\r\n\r\n[472] _Histoire naturelle des Orangers_, Paris, 1818. p. 111. tab.\r\n53, or the same work, new edition, by Dubreuil, 1873, p. 82.

He states that\r\nthe Italians prepare from it the finest essences, which are sold at a\r\nhigh price.[479]\r\n\r\nBut, as shown by one of us,[480] the essential oil of bergamot had\r\nalready, in 1688, a place among the stores of an apothecary of the\r\nGerman town of Giessen.\r\n\r\nThe name Bergamotta was originally applied to a large kind of pear,\r\ncalled in Turkish “beg-ârmûdî,” _i.e._ prince’s pear.[481]\r\n\r\n=Production=—The bergamot is cultivated at Reggio, on low ground near\r\nthe sea, and in the adjacent villages. The trees are often intermixed\r\nwith lemon and orange trees, and the soil is well irrigated and cropped\r\nwith vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe essential oil (_Oleum Bergamottæ_) is obtained from the full-grown\r\nbut still unripe and more or less green fruits, gathered in the\r\nmonths of November and December. They are richer in oil than any one\r\nof the allied fruits. It was formerly made like that of lemon by the\r\nsponge-process, but during the last 20 years this method has been\r\ngenerally superseded by the introduction of a special machine for\r\nthe extraction of the essential oil. In this machine the fruits are\r\nplaced in a strong, saucer-like, metallic dish, about 10 inches in\r\ndiameter, having in the centre a raised opening which with the outer\r\nedge forms a broad groove or channel; the dish is fitted with a cover\r\nof similar form. The inner surface both of the dish and cover is\r\nrendered rough by a series of narrow, radiating metal ridges of blades\r\nwhich are about ¼ of an inch high and resemble the backs of knifes.\r\nThe dish is also furnished with some small openings to allow of the\r\noutflow of essential oil; and both dish and cover are arranged in a\r\nmetallic cylinder, placed over a vessel to receive the oil. By a simple\r\narrangement of cog-wheels moved by a handle, the cover, which is very\r\nheavy, is made to revolve rapidly over the dish, and the fruit lying\r\nin the groove between the two is carried round, and at the same time\r\nis subjected to the action of the sharp ridges, which, rupturing the\r\noil-vessels, cause the essence to escape, and set it free to flow out\r\nby the small openings in the bottom of the dish. The fruits are placed\r\nin the machine, 6, 8, or more at a time, according to their size, and\r\nsubjected to the rotatory action above described for about half a\r\nminute, when the machine is stopped, they are removed, and fresh ones\r\nsubstituted. About 7,000 fruits can thus be worked in one of these\r\nmachines in a day. The yield of oil is said to be similar to that of\r\nlemon, namely 2½ to 3 ounces from 100 fruits.\r\n\r\n[479] _Hesperides Norimbergenses_, 1713. lib. 3. cap. 26. and p. 156 b.\r\n(We quote from the Latin edition.)\r\n\r\n[480] Flückiger, _Documente zur Geschichte der Pharmacie_, Halle, 1876.\r\n72.\r\n\r\n[481] Information, for which I am indebted to Dr. Rice.—The name has no\r\nreference to the town of Bergamo, where bergamots cannot succeed.—F. A.\r\nF.\r\n\r\nEssence of bergamot made by the machine is of a greener tint than that\r\nobtained by the old sponge-process. During some weeks after extraction\r\nit gradually deposits a quantity of white greasy matter (bergaptene),\r\nwhich, after having been exhausted as much as possible by pressure, is\r\nfinally subjected to distillation with water in order to separate the\r\nessential oil it still contains.\r\n\r\nThe fruits from which the essence has been extracted are submitted to\r\npressure, and the juice, which is much inferior in acidity to lemon\r\njuice, is concentrated and sold for the manufacture of citric acid.\r\nFinally, the residue from which both essence and juice have been\r\nremoved, is consumed as food by oxen.\r\n\r\n=Description=[482]—Essential oil of bergamot is a thin and mobile fluid\r\nof peculiar and very fragrant odour, bitterish taste, and slightly\r\nacid reaction. It has a pale greenish yellow tint, due to traces of\r\nchlorophyll, as may be shown by the spectroscope. Its sp. gr. is 0·86\r\nto 0·88; its boiling point varies from 183° to 195° C.\r\n\r\nThe oil is miscible with spirit of wine (0·83 sp. gr.), absolute\r\nalcohol, as well as with crystallizable acetic acid. Four parts\r\ndissolve clearly one part of bisulphide of carbon, but the solution\r\nbecomes turbid if a larger proportion of the latter is added.\r\nBisulphide of carbon itself is incapable of dissolving clearly any\r\nappreciable quantity of the oil. A mixture of 10 drops of the oil, 50\r\ndrops of bisulphide of carbon and one of strong sulphuric acid has\r\nan intense yellow hue. Perchloride of iron imparts to bergamot oil\r\ndissolved in alcohol a dingy brown colour.\r\n\r\nPanuccio’s oil of bergamot examined in the same way as that of lemon\r\n(p. 120) deviates 7° to the right, and has therefore a dextrogyre\r\npower very inferior to that of other oils of the same class.[483] But\r\nit probably varies in this respect, for commercial specimens which we\r\njudged to be of good quality deviated from 6·8° to 10·4° to the right.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—If essential oil of bergamot is submitted to\r\nrectification, the portions that successively distill over do not\r\naccord in rotatory power or in boiling point, a fact which proves it to\r\nbe a mixture of several oils, as is further confirmed by analysis. It\r\nappears to consist of hydrocarbons, C₁₀H₁₆, and their hydrates, neither\r\nof which have as yet been satisfactorily isolated. Oil of bergamot,\r\nlike that of turpentine, yields crystals of the composition C₁₀H₁₆ +\r\n3H₂O, if 8 parts are allowed to stand some weeks with 1 part of spirit\r\nof wine, 2 of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1·2) and 10 of water, the mixture\r\nbeing frequently shaken. No solid compound is produced by saturating\r\nthe oil with anhydrous hydrochloric gas.\r\n\r\nThe greasy matter that is deposited from oil of bergamot soon after\r\nits extraction, and in small quantity is often noticeable in that\r\nof commerce, is called _Bergaptene_ or _Bergamot Camphor_. We have\r\nobtained it in fine, white, acicular crystals, neutral and inodorous,\r\nby repeated solution in spirit of wine. Its composition according\r\nto the analysis of Mulder (1837) and of Ohme (1839) answers to the\r\nformula C₉H₆O₃, which in our opinion requires further investigation.\r\nCrystallized bergaptene is abundantly soluble in chloroform, ether, or\r\nbisulphide of carbon; the alcoholic solution is not altered by ferric\r\nsalts.\r\n\r\n[482] The characters are taken from some Essence of Bergamot presented\r\nto one of us (15 May 1872) as a type-sample by Messrs. G. Panuccio e\r\nfigli, manufacturers of essences at Reggio and also large cultivators\r\nof the bergamot orange.\r\n\r\n[483] See however _Oleum Neroli_, p. 127.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Essence of bergamot, as it is always termed in trade, is\r\nchiefly shipped from Messina and Palermo in the same kind of bottles as\r\nare used for essence of lemon.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Much employed in perfumery, but in medicine only occasionally\r\nfor the sake of imparting an agreeable odour to ointments.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Essence of bergamot, like that of lemon, is extensively\r\nand systematically adulterated, and very little is sent into the market\r\nentirely pure. It is often mixed with oil of turpentine, but a finer\r\nadulteration is to dilute it with essential oil of the leaves or with\r\nthat obtained by distillation of the peel or of the residual fruits.\r\nSome has of late been adulterated with petroleum.\r\n\r\nThe optical properties, as already mentioned, may afford some\r\nassistance in detecting fraudulent admixtures, though as regards oil of\r\nturpentine it must be borne in mind that there are _levogyre_ as well\r\nas _dextrogyre_ varieties. This latter oil and likewise that of lemon\r\nis less soluble in spirit of wine than that of bergamot.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTEX AURANTII.\r\n\r\n_Bitter Orange Peel_; F. _Ecorce ou Zestes d’Oranges amères_; G.\r\n_Pomeranzenschale_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Citrus vulgaris_ Risso (_C. Aurantium_ var. _a\r\namara_ Linn., _C. Bigaradia_ Duhamel).\r\n\r\nThe Bitter or Seville or Bigarade Orange, _Bigaradier_[484] of the\r\nFrench, is a small tree extensively cultivated in the warmer parts of\r\nthe Mediterranean region, especially in Spain, and existing under many\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nNorthern India is the native country of the orange tree. In Gurhwal,\r\nSikkim, and Khasia there occurs a wild orange which is the supposed\r\nparent of the cultivated orange, whether Sweet or Bitter.\r\n\r\nThe Bitter Orange reproduces itself from seed, and is regarded, at\r\nleast by cultivators, as quite distinct from the Sweet Orange, from\r\nwhich however it cannot be distinguished by any important botanical\r\ncharacters. Generally speaking, it differs from the latter in having\r\nthe fruit rugged on the surface, of a more deep or reddish-orange hue,\r\nwith the pulp very sour and bitter. The peel, as well as the flowers\r\nand leaves, are more aromatic than the corresponding parts of the Sweet\r\nOrange, and the petiole is more broadly winged.\r\n\r\n=History=—The orange was unknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans;\r\nand its introduction to Europe is due to the Arabs, who, according to\r\nGallesio,[485] appear to have established the tree first in Eastern\r\nAfrica, Arabia, and Syria, whence it was gradually conveyed to Italy,\r\nSicily, and Spain. In the opinion of the writer just quoted, the bitter\r\norange was certainly known at the commencement of the 10th century to\r\nthe Arabian physicians, one of whom, Avicenna,[486] employed its juice\r\nin medicine.\r\n\r\n[484] From the Basque “bizarra” = beard (Rice, _New Remedies_, 1878.\r\n231), or from the Sanskrit Bijouri.\r\n\r\n[485] _Traité du Citrus_, Paris, 1811. 222.\r\n\r\n[486] _Opera_, ed. Valgrisi 1564. lib. v. sum. 1. tract. 9. p. 289.—The\r\npassage, which is the following, seems rather inconclusive:—“ ... succi\r\nacetositatis citri et succi acetositatis citranguli.”\r\n\r\nThere is strong evidence to show that the orange first cultivated in\r\nEurope was the _Bitter Orange_ or _Bigarade_. The orange tree at Rome,\r\nsaid to have been planted by St. Dominic about A.D. 1200, and which\r\nstill exists at the monastery of St. Sabina, bears a _bitter_ fruit;\r\nand the ancient trees standing in the garden of the Alcazar at Seville\r\nare also of this variety. Finally, the oranges of Syria (_ab indigenis_\r\nOrenges _nuncupati_) described by Jacques de Vitri, Bishop of Acon\r\n(_ob._ A.D. 1214) were _acidi seu pontici saporis_.[487]\r\n\r\nThe Sweet Orange began to be cultivated about the middle of the 15th\r\ncentury, having been introduced from the East by the Portuguese. It has\r\nprobably long existed in Southern China, and may have been taken thence\r\nto India. In the latter country there are but few districts in which\r\nits cultivation is successful, and the Bitter Orange is hardly known at\r\nall. The name it has long borne of _China_[488] or _Portugal Orange_\r\nindicates what has been the usual opinion as to its origin. It probably\r\nalludes more exactly to a superior variety brought about 1630 from\r\nChina to Portugal.[489]\r\n\r\nOne of the first importations of oranges into England occurred in A.D.\r\n1290, in which year a Spanish ship came to Portsmouth, of the cargo of\r\nwhich the queen of Edward I. bought one frail of Seville figs, one of\r\nraisins or grapes, one bale of dates, 230 pomegranates, 15 citrons, and\r\n7 _oranges_ (“_poma de orenge_”).[490]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The Bitter Orange known in London as the _Seville\r\nOrange_ is a globular fruit, resembling in size, form, and structure\r\nthe common Sweet Orange, but having the peel much rougher, and when\r\nmature of a somewhat deeper hue. The pulp of the fruit is filled with\r\nan acid bitter juice. The ripe fruit is imported into London; the\r\npeel is removed from it with a sharp knife in one long spiral strip,\r\nand quickly dried, or it is sold in the fresh state. It is the more\r\nesteemed when cut thin, so as to include as little as possible of the\r\nwhite inner layer.\r\n\r\nWell-dried orange peel should be externally of a bright tint and white\r\non its inner surface; it should have a grateful aromatic smell and\r\nbitter taste. The peel is also largely imported into London ready\r\ndried, especially from Malta. We have observed it from this latter\r\nplace of three qualities, namely in elliptic pieces or quarters, in\r\nbroad curled strips, and lastly a very superior kind, almost wholly\r\nfree from white zest, in strips less than ⅛ of an inch in width, cut\r\napparently by a machine. Such needless subdivision as this last has\r\nundergone must greatly favour an alteration and waste of the essential\r\noil. Foreign-dried orange peel fetches a lower price than that dried in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—There is no difference between the tissues of\r\nthis drug and those of lemon peel.\r\n\r\n[487] Vitriaco, _Hist. orient. et occident._ 1597. cap. 86.\r\n\r\n[488] Hence the Dutch _Sinaasappel_ or _Appelsina_ and the German\r\n_Apfelsine_.\r\n\r\n[489] Goeze, _Beitrag zur Kenntniss der Orangengewächse_, Hamburg,\r\n1874. 29.\r\n\r\n[490] _Manners and Household Expenses of England in the 13th and 15th\r\ncenturies_, Lond. (Roxburghe Club) 1841. xlviii.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The essential oil to which the peel of the\r\norange owes its fragrant odour, is a distinct article of commerce, and\r\nwill be noticed hereafter under a separate head. The other constituents\r\nof the peel probably agree with those of lemon peel. The substance\r\nmentioned under the name of _Hesperidin_ (p. 116) particularly abounds\r\nin unripe bitter oranges.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Bitter orange peel is much used in medicine as an aromatic tonic.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLEUM NEROLI.\r\n\r\n_Oleum Aurantii florum_; _Oil or Essence of Neroli_; F. _Essence de\r\nNéroli_; G. _Neroliöl_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Citrus vulgaris_ Risso. (See page 124.)\r\n\r\n=History=—Porta, the Italian philosopher of the 16th century referred\r\nto (p. 118), was acquainted with the volatile oil of the flowers of\r\nthe citron tribe (“_Oleum ex citriorum floribus_”), which he obtained\r\nby the usual process of distillation, and describes as possessing\r\nthe most exquisite fragrance. That distilled from orange flowers\r\nacquired a century later (1675-1685) the name of _Essence of Neroli_\r\nfrom Anne-Marie de la Trémoille-Noirmoutier, second wife of Flavio\r\nOrsini, duke of Bracciano and prince of Nerola or Neroli. This lady\r\nemployed it for the perfuming of gloves, hence called in Italy _Guanti\r\ndi Neroli_.[491] It was known in Paris to Pomet, who says[492] the\r\nperfumers have given it the name of _Neroli_, and that it is made in\r\nRome and in Provence.\r\n\r\n=Production=—Oil of Neroli is prepared from the fresh flowers of the\r\nBigarade or Bitter Orange by the ordinary process of distillation with\r\nwater, conducted in small copper stills. The flowers of all the allied\r\nplants are far less aromatic. The water which distills over with the\r\noil constitutes, after the removal of the latter from its surface, the\r\n_Orange Flower Water_ (_Aqua aurantii florum vel Aqua Naphæ_)[493] of\r\ncommerce. The manufacture is carried on chiefly in the south of France\r\nat Grasse, Cannes, and Nice. The yield is about 0·6 to 0·7 per cent. of\r\noil from fresh flowers, as stated by Poiteau et Risso.[494] The flowers\r\nof the sweet orange afford but half that amount of oil.\r\n\r\n=Description and Chemical Composition=—Oil of Neroli as found in\r\ncommerce is seldom pure, for it generally contains an admixture of the\r\nessential oil of orange-leaf called _Essence of Petit Grain_.\r\n\r\nBy the kind assistance of Mr. F. G. Warrick of Nice, we have obtained a\r\nsample of Bigarade Neroli of guaranteed purity, to which the following\r\nobservations relate. It is of a brownish hue, most fragrant odour,\r\nbitterish aromatic taste, and is neutral to test-paper. Its sp. gr.\r\nat 11° C. is 0·889. When mixed with alcohol, it displays a bright\r\nviolet fluorescence, quite distinct from the blue fluorescence of a\r\nsolution of quinine. In oil of Neroli the phenomenon may be shown most\r\ndistinctly by pouring a little spirit of wine on to the surface of\r\nthe essential oil, and causing the liquid to gently undulate. The oil\r\nis but turbidly miscible with bisulphide of carbon. It assumes a very\r\npure, intense, and permanent crimson hue if shaken with a saturated\r\nsolution of bisulphide of sodium. Examined in a column of 100 mm. we\r\nobserved the oil to deviate the ray of polarized light 6° to the right.\r\n\r\n[491] Menagio, _Origini della Lingua Italiana_, 1685; _Dict. de\r\nTrévoux_, Paris, vi. (1771) 178.—The town of Nerola is about 16 miles\r\nnorth of Tivoli.\r\n\r\n[492] _Histoire des Drogues_, 1694. 234. ii.\r\n\r\n[493] Naphé or Naphore—according to Poiteau et Risso, _Hist. Nat. des\r\nOrangers_ 1873. 211, these names perhaps originated in Languedoc.\r\n\r\n[494] _L. c._ 211.\r\n\r\nSubjected to distillation, the larger part of the oil passes over at\r\n185°-195° C.; we found this portion to be colourless, yet to display in\r\na marked manner the violet fluorescence and also to retain the odour of\r\nthe original oil. The portion remaining in the retort was mixed with\r\nabout the same volume of alcohol (90 per cent.) and some drops of water\r\nadded, yet not sufficient to occasion turbidity. A very small amount\r\nof the crystalline _Neroli Camphor_ then made its appearance, floating\r\non the surface of the liquid; by re-solution in boiling alcohol it was\r\nobtained in crystals of rather indistinct form. The redistilled oil\r\ngave no camphor whatever.\r\n\r\nNeroli Camphor was first noticed by Boullay in 1828. According to\r\nour observations it is a neutral, inodorous, tasteless substance,\r\nfusible at 55° C., and forming on cooling a crystalline mass. The\r\ncrystallization should be effected by cooling the hot alcoholic\r\nsolution, no good crystals being obtainable by slow evaporation or by\r\nsublimation. The produce was extremely small, about 60 grammes of oil\r\nhaving yielded not more than 0·1 gramme. Perhaps this scantiness of\r\nproduce was due to the oil being a year and a half old, for according\r\nto Plisson[495] the camphor diminishes the longer the oil is kept.[496]\r\nWe were unable to obtain any similar substance from the oils of\r\nbergamot, petit grain, or orange peel.\r\n\r\n_Orange Flower Water_ is a considerable article of manufacture among\r\nthe distillers of essential oils in the south of Europe, and is\r\nimported thence for use in pharmacy. According to Boullay[497] it is\r\nfrequently acid to litmus when first made,—is better if distilled in\r\nsmall than in large quantities, and if made from the petals _per se_,\r\nrather than from the entire flowers. He also states that only 2 lb. of\r\nwater should be drawn from 1 lb. of flowers, or 3 lb. if petals alone\r\nare placed in the still. As met with in commerce, orange flower water\r\nis colourless or of a faintly greenish yellow tinge, almost perfectly\r\ntransparent, with a delicious odour and a bitter taste. Acidulated with\r\nnitric acid, it acquires a pinkish hue more or less intense, which\r\ndisappears on saturation by an alkali.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Oil of Neroli is consumed almost exclusively in perfumery.\r\nOrange flower water is frequently used in medicine to give a pleasant\r\nodour to mixtures and lotions.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The large variation in value of oil of Neroli as shown\r\nby price-currents[498] indicates a great diversity of quality. Besides\r\nbeing very commonly mixed, as already stated, with the distilled oil\r\nof the leaves (_Essence de Petit Grain_)[499], it is sometimes reduced\r\nby addition of the less fragrant oil obtained from the flowers of\r\nthe Portugal or Sweet Orange. In some of these adulterations we must\r\nconclude that orange flower water participate: metallic contamination\r\nof the latter is not unknown.\r\n\r\n[495] _Journ. de Pharm._ xv. (1829) 152.\r\n\r\n[496] Yet we extracted it from an old sample labelled “_Essence de\r\nNéroli Portugal—Méro._”\r\n\r\n[497] _Bulletin de Pharm._, i. (1809) 337-341.\r\n\r\n[498] Thus in the price-list of a firm at Grasse, Neroli is quoted as\r\nof _four_ qualities, the lowest or “commercial” being less than half\r\nthe price of the finest.\r\n\r\n[499] We have been informed on good authority that the Neroli commonly\r\nsold contains ⅜ of Essence of Petit Grain, and ⅛ of Essence of\r\nBergamot, the remaining ⁴/₈ being true Neroli.\r\n\r\nOther Products of the genus Citrus.\r\n\r\n=Essence or Essential Oil of Petit Grain=—was originally obtained by\r\nsubjecting little immature oranges to distillation (Pomet—1692); but\r\nit is now produced, and to a large extent, by distillation of the\r\nleaves and shoots either of the Bigarade or Bitter Orange, or of the\r\nPortugal or Sweet Orange. The essence of the former is by far the\r\nmore fragrant, and commands double the price. Poiteau and Risso[500]\r\nstate that the leaves of the Brigaradier with bitter fruit are by far\r\nthe richest in essential oil among all the allied leaves; they are\r\nobtained in the lemon-growing districts of the Mediterranean where\r\nthe essence is manufactured. Lemon-trees being mostly grafted on\r\norange-stocks, the latter during the summer put forth shoots, which\r\nare allowed to grow till they are often some feet in length. The\r\ncultivator then cuts them off, binds them in bundles, and conveys them\r\nto the distiller of _Petit Grain_. The strongest shoots are frequently\r\nreserved for walking-sticks. The leaves of the two sorts of orange are\r\neasily distinguished by their smell when crushed. Essence of Petit\r\nGrain, which in odour has a certain resemblance to Neroli, is used in\r\nperfumery and especially in the manufacture of Eau de Cologne.\r\n\r\nAccording to Gladstone (1864) it consists mainly of a hydrocarbon\r\nprobably identical with that from oil of Neroli.\r\n\r\n=Essential Oil of Orange Peel=—is largely made at Messina and also\r\nin the south of France. It is extracted by the sponge-, or by the\r\n_écuelle_-process, and partly from the Bigarade and partly from the\r\nSweet or Portugal Orange, the scarcely ripe fruit being in either\r\ncase employed. The oil made from the former is much more valuable\r\nthan that obtained from the latter, and the two are distinguished in\r\nprice-currents as _Essence de Bigarade_ and _Essence de Portugal_.\r\n\r\nThese essences are but little consumed in England, in liqueur-making\r\nand in perfumery. For what is known of their chemical nature, the\r\nreader can consult the works named at foot[501].\r\n\r\n=Essence of Cedrat=—The true Citron or Cedrat tree is _Citrus medica_\r\nRisso, and is of interest as being the only member of the Orange tribe\r\nthe fruit of which was known in ancient Rome. The tree itself, which\r\nappears to have been cultivated in Palestine in the time of Josephus,\r\nwas introduced into Italy in about the 3rd century. In A.D. 1003 it\r\nwas much grown at Salerno near Naples, whence its fruits were sent as\r\npresents to the Norman princes[502].\r\n\r\n[500] _Loc. c._, edition of 1873. 211.\r\n\r\n[501] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, xiv. (1860) 305. 306: Gladstone, _Journ.\r\nof Chem. Soc._ xvii. (1864) 1: Wright (and Piesse) in _Yearbook of\r\nPharmacy_, 1871. 546; 1873. 518; _Journ. of Chem. Soc._ xi. (1873)\r\n552, &c. We may moreover point out the existence of a crystallized\r\nconstituent of the oil of orange peel from the island of Curaçao. It\r\nwas noticed as long ago as the year 1771 by Gaubius: “Sal aromaticus,\r\nnativus, ex oleo corticum mali aurei Curassavici,” in his book,\r\n“Adersariorum varii argumenti, lib. unus.” Leidae, 1771. 27.\r\n\r\n[502] Gallesio, _Traité du Citrus_, 1811. 222.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, the citron appears to be nowhere cultivated\r\nextensively, the more prolific lemon tree having generally taken its\r\nplace. It is however scattered along the Western Riviera, and is also\r\ngrown on a small scale about Pizzo and Paola on the western coast of\r\nCalabria, in Sicily, Corsica, and Azores. Its fruits, which often weigh\r\nseveral pounds, are chiefly sold for being candied. For this purpose\r\nthe peel, which is excessively thick, is salted and in that state\r\nshipped to England and Holland. The fruit has a very scanty pulp[503].\r\n\r\nEssence of Cedrat which is quoted in some price-lists may be prepared\r\nfrom the scarcely ripe fruit by the sponge-process; but as it is more\r\nprofitable to export the fruit salted, it is very rarely manufactured,\r\nand that which bears its name is for the most part fictitious.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS BELÆ.\r\n\r\n_Bela_; _Bael Fruit_, _Indian Bael_, _Bengal Quince_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Ægle Marmelos_[504] Correa (_Cratæva Marmelos_ L.),\r\na tree found in most parts of the Indian peninsula, which is often\r\nplanted in the neighbourhood of temples, being esteemed sacred by the\r\nHindus. It is truly wild in the forests of the Coromandel Ghâts and\r\nof the Western Himalaya, ascending often to 4,000 feet and growing\r\ngregarious when wild.\r\n\r\nIt attains a height of 30-40 feet, is usually armed with strong sharp\r\nthorns and has trifid leaves, the central leaflet being petiolate and\r\nlarger than the lateral. The fruit is a large berry, 2 to 4 inches in\r\ndiameter, variable in shape, being spherical or somewhat flattened like\r\nan orange, ovoid, or pyriform[505], having a smooth hard shell; the\r\ninterior divided into 10-15 cells each containing several woolly seeds,\r\nconsists of a mucilaginous pulp, which becomes very hard in drying. In\r\nthe fresh state the fruit is very aromatic, and the juicy pulp which it\r\ncontains has an agreeable flavour, so that when mixed with water and\r\nsweetened, it forms a palatable refrigerant drink. The fruit is never\r\neaten as dessert, though its pulp is sometimes made into a preserve\r\nwith sugar.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the wild tree is described as small, hard, and\r\nflavourless, remaining long on the tree. The bark of the stem and root,\r\nthe flowers and the expressed juice of the leaves are used in medicine\r\nby the natives of India.\r\n\r\n=History=—The tree under the name of _Bilva_[506] is constantly alluded\r\nto as an emblem of increase and fertility in ancient Sanskrit poems,\r\nsome of which as the Yajar Veda are supposed to have been written not\r\nlater than 1000 B.C.—Constantinus Africanus was acquainted with the\r\nfruit under notice.\r\n\r\n[503] Oribasius accurately describes the citron as a fruit consisting\r\nof three parts, namely a central acid pulp, a thick and fleshy zest and\r\nan aromatic outer coat.—_Medicinalia collecta_, lib. i. c. 64.\r\n\r\n[504] _Ægle_, one of the Hesperides.—_Marmeloes_ from the Portuguese\r\n_marmelo_, a quince.—Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, part 11.\r\n\r\n[505] In the Botanical Garden of Buitenzorg in Java, three varieties\r\nare grown, namely—_fructibus oblongis_, _fructibus subglobosis_, and\r\n_macrocarpa_.\r\n\r\n[506] We are indebted to Professor Monier Williams of Oxford for\r\npointing out to us many references to _Bilva_ in the Sanskrit writings.\r\n\r\nGarcia de Orta, who resided in India as physician to the Portuguese\r\nviceroy at Goa in the 16th century, wrote an account of the fruit\r\nunder the name of _Marmelos de Benguala_ (Bengal Quince) _Cirifole_ or\r\n_Beli_[507], describing its use in dysentery.\r\n\r\nIn the following century it was noticed by Bontius, in whose writings\r\nedited by Piso[508] there is a bad figure of the tree as _Malum\r\nCydonium_. It was also figured by Rheede,[509] and subsequently under\r\nthe designation of _Bilack_ or _Bilack tellor_ by Rumphius.[510] The\r\nlatter states that it is indigenous to Gujarat, the eastern parts of\r\nJava, Sumbawa and Celebes, and that it has been introduced into Amboina.\r\n\r\nBut although _Ægle Marmelos_ has thus been long known and appreciated\r\nin India, the use of its fruit as a medicine attracted no attention in\r\nEurope till about the year 1850. The dried fruit which has a place in\r\nthe _British Pharmacopœia_ is now not unfrequently imported.\r\n\r\n=Description=—We have already described the form and structure of the\r\nfruit, which for medicinal use should be dried when in a half ripe\r\nstate. It is found in commerce in dried slices having on the outer side\r\na smooth greyish shell enclosing a hard, orange or red, gummy pulp in\r\nwhich are some of the 10 to 15 cells existing in the entire fruit. Each\r\ncell includes 6 to 10 compressed oblong seeds nearly 3 lines in length,\r\ncovered with whitish woolly hairs. When broken the pulp is seen to\r\nbe nearly colourless internally, the outside alone having assumed an\r\norange tint. The dried pulp has a mucilaginous, slightly acid taste,\r\nwithout aroma, astringency, or sweetness.\r\n\r\nThere is also imported Bael fruit which has been collected when\r\nripe, as shown by the well-formed seeds. Such fruits arrive broken\r\nirregularly and dried, or sawn into transverse slices and then dried,\r\nor lastly entire, in which case they retain some of their original\r\nfragrance resembling that of elemi.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The rind of the fruit is covered with a strong\r\ncuticle, and further shows two layers, the one exhibiting not very\r\nnumerous oil-cells, and the other an inner made up of sclerenchyme. The\r\ntissue of the pulp, which, treated with water, swells into an elastic\r\nmass, consists of large cells with considerable cavities between them.\r\nThe seeds when moistened yield an abundance of mucilage nearly in the\r\nsame way as White Mustard or Linseed. In the epidermis of the seeds\r\ncertain groups of cells are excessively lengthened, and thus constitute\r\nthe curious woolly hairs already noticed. They likewise afford mucilage\r\nin the same way as the seed itself.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—We are unable to confirm the remarkable analyses\r\nof the drug alluded to in the _Pharmacopœia of India_;[511] nor can we\r\nexplain by any chemical examination upon what constituent the alleged\r\nmedicinal efficacy of bael depends.\r\n\r\n[507] _Sirí-phal_ and _Bel_ are Hindustani names.—See also Flückiger,\r\n_Documente_, 29.\r\n\r\n[508] _De Indiæ re nat. et med._ 1658, lib. vi. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[509] _Hort.

It may be easily distinguished: it is _one-celled_ with a large\r\nfive-lobed cavity (instead of 10 to 15 cells) filled with numerous\r\nseeds. The tree has pinnate leaves with 2 or 3 pairs of leaflets. We\r\nhave seen _Pomegranate Peel_ offered as _Indian Bael_.[513]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMARUBEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGNUM QUASSIÆ.\r\n\r\n_Quassia_, _Quassia Wood_, _Bitter Wood_; F. _Bois de Quassia de la\r\nJamaïque_, _Bois amer_; G. _Jamaica Quassiaholz_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Picræna excelsa_ Lindl. (_Quassia excelsa_ Swartz,\r\n_Simaruba excelsa_ DC., _Picrasma excelsa_ Planchon), a tree 50 to 60\r\nfeet in height, somewhat resembling an ash and having inconspicuous\r\ngreenish flowers and black shining drupes the size of a pea. It is\r\ncommon on the plains and lower mountains of Jamaica, and is also found\r\nin the islands of Antigua and St. Vincent. It is called in the West\r\nIndies _Bitter Wood_ or _Bitter Ash_.\r\n\r\n=History=—Quassia wood was introduced into Europe about the middle\r\nof the last century. It was derived from _Quassia amara_ L., a shrub\r\nor small tree with handsome crimson flowers, belonging to the same\r\norder, native of Panama, Venezuela, Guiana, and Northern Brazil. It\r\nwas subsequently found that the _Bitter Wood_ of Jamaica which Swartz\r\nand other botanists referred to the same genus, possessed similar\r\nproperties, and as it was obtainable of much larger size, it has since\r\nthe end of the last century been generally preferred. The wood of _Q.\r\namara_, called _Surinam Quassia_, is however still used in France and\r\nGermany.[514]\r\n\r\n[512] We are thus at variance with Collas of Pondichéry, who attributes\r\nto the ripe fruit 5 _per cent. of tannin_.—_Hist. nat. etc. du Bel ou\r\nVilva_ in _Revue Coloniale_, xvi. (1856) 220-238.\r\n\r\n[513] 40 bags in a drug sale, 8th May, 1873.\r\n\r\n[514] The _Pharmacopœa Germanica_ of 1872 expressly forbids the use of\r\nthe wood of _Picræna_ in place of _Quassia_.\r\n\r\nThe first to give a good account of Jamaica quassia was John\r\nLindsay,[515] a medical practitioner of the island, who writing in 1791\r\ndescribed the tree as long known not only for its excellent timber, but\r\nalso as a useful medicine in putrid fevers and fluxes. He adds that\r\nthe _bark_ is exported to England in considerable quantity—“for the\r\npurposes of the brewers of ale and porter.”\r\n\r\nQuassia, defined as the wood, bark, and root of _Q. amara_ L., was\r\nintroduced into the London Pharmacopœia of 1788; in the edition of\r\n1809, it was superseded by the wood of _Picræna excelsa_. In the\r\nstock-book of a London druggist (J. Gurney Bevan, of Plough Court,\r\nLombard Street) we find it first noticed in 1781 (as _rasuræ_), when it\r\nwas reckoned as having cost 4_s._ 2_d._ per lb.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The quassia wood of commerce consists of pieces of the\r\nstem and larger branches, some feet in length, and often as thick as\r\na man’s thigh. It is covered with bark externally of a dusky grey or\r\nblackish hue, white and fibrous within, which it is customary to strip\r\noff and reject. The wood, which is of a very light yellowish tint, is\r\ntough and strong, but splits easily. In transverse section it exhibits\r\nnumerous fine close medullary rays, which intersect the rather obscure\r\nand irregular rings resembling those of annual growth of our indigenous\r\nwoody stems. The centre is occupied by a cylinder of pith of minute\r\nsize. In a longitudinal section, whether tangential or radial, the wood\r\nappears transversely striated by reason of the small vertical height of\r\nthe medullary rays.\r\n\r\nThe wood often exhibits certain blackish markings due to the mycelium\r\nof a fungus; they have sometimes the aspect of delicate patterns, and\r\nat others appear as large dark patches.\r\n\r\nQuassia has a strong, pure bitter taste, but is devoid of odour. It\r\nis always supplied to the retail druggist in the form of turnings or\r\nraspings, the former being obtained in the manufacture of the _Bitter\r\nCups_, now often seen in the shops.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The wood consists for the most part of\r\nelongated pointed cells (libriform), traversed by medullary rays, each\r\nof the latter being built up of about 15 vertical layers of cells. The\r\nsingle layers contain from one to three rows of cells. The ligneous\r\nrays thus enclosed by medullary parenchyme, are intersected by groups\r\nof tissue constituting the above-mentioned irregular rings. On a\r\nlongitudinal section this parenchyme exhibits numerous crystals of\r\noxalate of calcium, and sometimes deposits of yellow resin. The latter\r\nis more abundant in the large vessels of the wood. Oxalate and resin\r\nare the only solid matters perceptible in the tissues of this drug.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The bitter taste of quassia is due to\r\n_Quassiin_, which was first obtained, no doubt, from the wood of\r\n_Quassia amara_, by Winckler in 1835. It was analysed by Wiggers,[516]\r\nwho assigned it the formula C₁₀H₁₂O₃, now regarded as doubtful.\r\nAccording to the latter, quassiin is an irresolvable, neutral\r\nsubstance, crystallizable from dilute alcohol or from chloroform. It\r\nrequires for solution about 200 parts of water, but is not soluble in\r\nether; it forms an insoluble compound with tannic acid. Quassia wood\r\nis said to yield about ⅒ per cent. of quassiin. A watery infusion of\r\nquassia, especially if a little caustic lime has been added to the\r\ndrug, displays a slight fluorescence, due apparently to quassiin.\r\nGoldschmiedt and Weidel (1877) failed in obtaining quassiin. They\r\nisolated the yellow resin which we mentioned above, and stated that it\r\nyields protocatechuic acid when melted with potash. Quassia wood dried\r\nat 100° C. yielded us 7·8 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\n[515] _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh_, iii. (1794) 205. tab. 6.\r\n\r\n[516] Liebig’s _Annalen der Pharm._ xxi. (1837) 40.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The quantity of Bitter Wood shipped from Jamaica in 1871 was\r\n56 tons.[517]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The drug is employed as a stomachic and tonic. It is poisonous\r\nto flies, and is not without narcotic properties in respect to the\r\nhigher animals.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—The wood of _Quassia amara_ L., the _Bitter Wood of\r\nSurinam_, bears a close resemblance, both external and structural,\r\nto the drug just noticed; but its stems never exceed four inches in\r\ndiameter and are commonly still thinner. Their thin, brittle bark is\r\nof a greyish yellow, and separates easily from the wood. The latter\r\nis somewhat denser than the quassia of Jamaica, from which it may be\r\ndistinguished by its medullary rays being composed of a single or less\r\nfrequently of a double row of cells, whereas in the wood of _Picræna\r\nexcelsa_, they consist of two or three rows, less frequently of only\r\none.\r\n\r\nSurinam Quassia Wood is exported from the Dutch colony of Surinam. The\r\nquantity shipped thence during the nine months ending 30th Sept, 1872,\r\nwas 264,675 lb.[518]\r\n\r\nThe bark of _Samadera indica_ Gärtn., a tree of the same natural order,\r\nowes its bitterness to a principle[519] which agrees perhaps with\r\nquassiin. The aqueous infusion of the bark is abundantly precipitated\r\nby tannic acid, a compound of quassiin probably being formed. A similar\r\ntreatment applied to quassia would possibly easier afford quassiin than\r\nthe extraction of the wood by means of alcohol, as performed by Wiggers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURSERACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLIBANUM.\r\n\r\n_Gummmi-resina Olibanum_, _Thus masculum_[520]; _Olibanum_,\r\n_Frankincense_; F. _Encens_; G. _Weihrauch_.\r\n\r\n[517] _Blue Book_, Island of Jamaica, for 1871.\r\n\r\n[518] _Consular Reports_, No. 3, presented to Parliament, July 1873.\r\n\r\n[519] Rost van Tonningen, _Jahresbericht_ of Wiggers (Canstatt) for\r\n1858. 75; _Pharm.

The word _Thus_,\r\non the other hand, seems to be derived from the verb θύειν, _to\r\nsacrifice_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—Olibanum is obtained from the stem of several\r\nspecies of _Boswellia_, inhabiting the hot and arid regions of Eastern\r\nAfrica, near Cape Gardafui and of the southern coast of Arabia.\r\nNotwithstanding the recent elaborate and valuable researches of\r\nBirdwood,[521] the olibanum trees are still but imperfectly known, as\r\nwill be evident in the following enumeration:—\r\n\r\n1. _Boswellia Carterii_ Birdw.—This includes the three following forms,\r\nwhich may be varieties of a single species, or may belong to two or\r\nmore species,—a point impossible to settle until more perfect materials\r\nshall have been obtained.\r\n\r\na. _Boswellia_ No. 5, Oliver, _Flora of Tropical Africa_, I. (1868)\r\n324, _Mohr meddu_ or _Mohr madow_ of the natives; _meddu_, according\r\nto Playfair and Hildebrandt, means black. The leaflets are crenate,\r\nundulate, and pubescent on both sides.\r\n\r\nThis tree is found in the Somali Country, growing a little inland in\r\nthe valleys and on the lower part of the hills, never on the range\r\nclose to the sea. It yields the olibanum called _Lubân Bedowi_ or\r\n_Lubân Sheheri_ (Playfair).\r\n\r\nHildebrandt describes the Mohr meddu as a tree 12 to 15 feet high, with\r\na few branches, indigenous to the limestone range of Ahl or Serrut, in\r\nthe northern part of the Somali Country, where it occurs in elevations\r\nof from 3000 to 5000 feet.

Bhau-Dajiana_.\r\n\r\nFrom the informations due to Captains Miles[523] and Hunter and to\r\nHaggenmacher[524] it would appear that the _Beyo_ or _Beyu_ of the\r\nSomalis (Boido, Capt. Hunter) is agreeing with this tree.\r\n\r\n4. _Boswellia neglecta_, S. Le M. Moore, in _Journ. of Botany_,\r\nxv.(1877) 67 and tab. 185. This tree has been collected by Hildebrandt\r\nin the limestone range, Ahl or Serrut, in the northern part of the\r\nSomali Country. It occurs in elevations of 1000 to 1800 metres,\r\nand attains a height of 5 to 6 metres. Its exudation, according to\r\nHildebrandt, is collected in but small quantity and mixed with the\r\nother kinds of olibanum. Moore gives _Murlo_ as the vernacular name of\r\nthis tree, Hildebrandt calls it _Mohr add_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the foregoing, from which the olibanum of commerce is\r\ncollected, it may be convenient to mention also the following:—\r\n\r\n1. _Boswellia Frereana_ Birdw., a well-marked and very distinct species\r\nof the Somali Country, which the natives call _Yegaar_. It abounds in\r\na highly fragrant resin collected and sold as _Lubân Meyeti_ or _Lubân\r\nMati_, which we regard to be the substance originally known as _Elemi_\r\n(see this article).\r\n\r\n2. _B. papyrifera_ Richard (_Plösslea floribunda_ Endl.), the “Makar”\r\nof Sennaar and the mountainous region ascending to 4000 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea on the Abyssinian rivers Takazze and Mareb. It appears\r\nnot to grow in the outer parts of north-eastern Africa. Its resin\r\nis not collected, and stated by Richard[525] to be transparent; it\r\nconsists no doubt merely of resin (and essential oil?) without gum.[526]\r\n\r\n3. _B. thurifera_ Colebr. (_B. glabra_ et _B. serrata_ Roxb.), the\r\n_Salai_ tree of India, produces a soft odoriferous resin which is used\r\nin the country as incense but is not the olibanum of commerce. The tree\r\nis particularly abundant on the trap hills of the Dekhan and Satpura\r\nrange. Berg, in “Offizinelle Gewächse,” xiv. c. gives a good figure of\r\nthis species.\r\n\r\n=History=—The use of olibanum goes back to a period of extreme\r\nantiquity, as proved by the numerous references[527] in the writings of\r\nthe Bible to _incense_, of which it was an essential ingredient. It is\r\nmoreover well known that many centuries before Christ, the drug was one\r\nof the most important objects of the traffic which the Phœnicians[528]\r\nand Egyptians carried on with Arabia.\r\n\r\n[523] See his picturesque description of the tree, _Journ. R. Geograph.\r\nSoc._ 22 (1872) 64.\r\n\r\n[524] Flückiger, _Pharm. Journ._ viii. (1878) 805.\r\n\r\n[525] _Tent. Floræ Abyssinicae_, i.

(1856) 99.\r\n299.—Sprenger, _l. c._ p. 299, also points out the importance of\r\nthe olibanum with regard to the commercial relations of those early\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dümichen[529] of Strassburg has discovered at the temple\r\nof Dayr el Báhri in Upper Egypt, paintings illustrating the traffic\r\ncarried on between Egypt and a distant country called Punt or Pount\r\nas early as the 17th century B.C. In these paintings there are\r\nrepresentations not only of bags of olibanum, but also of olibanum\r\ntrees planted in tubs or boxes, being conveyed by ship from Arabia to\r\nEgypt. Inscriptions on the same building, deciphered by Professor D.,\r\ndescribe with the utmost admiration the shipments of precious woods,\r\nheaps of incense, verdant incense trees,[530] ivory, gold, stimmi\r\n(sulphide of antimony), silver, apes, besides other productions not yet\r\nidentified. The country Pount was first thought to be southern Arabia,\r\nbut is now considered to comprehend the Somali coast, together with a\r\nportion of the opposite Arabian coast. Punt possibly refers to “Opone,”\r\nan old name for Hafoon, a place south of Cape Gardafui.\r\n\r\nA detailed account of frankincense is given by Theophrastus[531] (B.C.\r\n370-285) who relates that the commodity is produced in the country\r\nof the Sabæans, one of the most active trading nations of antiquity,\r\noccupying the southern shores of Arabia. It appears from Diodorus that\r\nthe Sabæans sold their frankincense to the Arabs, through whose hands\r\nit passed to the Phœnicians who disseminated the use of it in the\r\ntemples throughout their possessions, as well as among the nations with\r\nwhom they traded. The route of the caravans from south-eastern Arabia\r\nto Gaza in Palestine, has recently (1866) been pointed out by Professor\r\nSprenger. Plutarch relates that when Alexander the Great captured Gaza,\r\n500 talents of olibanum and 100 talents of myrrh were taken, and sent\r\nthence to Macedonia.\r\n\r\nThe _libanotophorous region_ of the old Sabæans is in fact the very\r\ncountry visited by Carter in 1844 and 1846, and lying as he states on\r\nthe south coast of Arabia between long. 52° 47′ and 52° 23′ east.[532]\r\nIt was also known to the ancients, at least to Strabo and Arrian, that\r\nthe opposite African coast likewise produced olibanum,[533] as it is\r\nnow doing almost exclusively; and the latter states that the drug is\r\nshipped partly to Egypt and partly to Barbaricon at the mouth of the\r\nIndus.\r\n\r\nAs exemplifying the great esteem in which frankincense was held\r\nby the ancients, the memorable gifts presented by the Magi to the\r\ninfant Saviour will occur to every mind. A few other instances may be\r\nmentioned: Herodotus[534] relates that the Arabians paid to Darius,\r\nking of Persia, an annual tribute of 1000 talents of frankincense.\r\n\r\nA remarkable Greek inscription, brought to light in modern times[535]\r\non the ruins of the temple of Apollo at Miletus, records the gifts\r\nmade to the shrine by Seleucus II., king of Syria (B.C. 246-227),\r\nand his brother Antiochus Hierax, king of Cilicia, which included in\r\naddition two vessels of gold and silver, ten talents of frankincense\r\n(λιβανωτοός) and one of myrrh.\r\n\r\n[529] Dümichen (Johannes), _The fleet of an_ _Egyptian Queen from the\r\n17th century before our era, and ancient Egyptian military parade,\r\nrepresented on a monument of the same age ... after a copy taken\r\nfrom the terrace of the temple of Dêr-el-Baheri_, translated from\r\nthe German by Anna Dümichen, Leipzig, 1868.—See also Mariette-Bey,\r\n_Deir-el-Bahari_, Leipzig, 1877, Pl. 6, 7, 8.\r\n\r\n[530] In one of the inscriptions they are referred to in terms which\r\nProfessor D. has thus rendered:—“Thirty-one verdant incense trees\r\nbrought among the precious things from the land of Punt for the majesty\r\nof this god Amon, the lord of the terrestrial thrones. Never has\r\nanything similar been seen since the foundation of the world.”\r\n\r\n[531] _Hist.

In the year\r\n1872, Shanghai imported[539] of this drug no less than 1,360 peculs\r\n(181,333 lb.).\r\n\r\n=Collection=—The fragrant gum-resin is distributed through the leaves\r\nand bark of the trees, and even exudes as a milky juice also from the\r\nflowers; its fragrance is stated to be already appreciable in a certain\r\ndistance. Cruttenden,[540] who visited the Somali Country in 1843, thus\r\ndescribes the collecting of olibanum by the Mijjertheyn tribe, whose\r\nchief port is Bunder Murayah (lat. 11° 43′ N.)[541]:—\r\n\r\n“During the hot season the men and boys are daily employed in\r\ncollecting gums, which process is carried on as follows:—About the end\r\nof February or beginning of March, the Bedouins visit all the trees\r\nin succession and make a deep incision in each, peeling off a narrow\r\nstrip of bark for about 5 inches below the wound. This is left for a\r\nmonth when a fresh incision is made in the same place, but deeper. A\r\nthird month elapses and the operation is again repeated, after which\r\nthe gum is supposed to have attained a proper degree of consistency.\r\nThe mountain sides are immediately covered with parties of men and\r\nboys, who scrape off the large clear globules into a basket, whilst\r\nthe inferior quality that has run down the tree is packed separately.\r\nThe gum when first taken from the tree is very soft, but hardens\r\nquickly.... Every fortnight the mountains are visited in this manner,\r\nthe trees producing larger quantities as the season advances, until the\r\nmiddle of September, when the first shower of rain puts a close to the\r\ngathering that year.”\r\n\r\nThe informations due to J. M. Hildebrandt, who visited the Somali in\r\n1875, are in accordance with Cruttenden’s statements. The former says,\r\nthat the latest crops are greatly injured by the rains, the drug being\r\npartly dissolved by the water.\r\n\r\n[536] These remarkable gifts are enumerated by Vignoli in his _Liber\r\nPontificalis_, Rome, 1724-55, and include beside Olibanum, _Oleum\r\nnardinum_, _Oleum Cyprium_, _Balsam_, _Storax Isaurica_, _Stacte_,\r\n_Aromata cassiæ_, _Saffron_ and _Pepper_.\r\n\r\n[537] The ancient name of Cape Gardafui was _Promontorium Aromatum_.\r\n\r\n[538] Bretschneider, _Ancient Chinese_, &c.

(13 Apr.\r\n1878) 806.\r\n\r\nCarter[542] describing the collection of the drug in southern Arabia,\r\nwrites thus:—“The gum is procured by making longitudinal incisions\r\nthrough the bark in the months of May and December, when the cuticle\r\nglistens with intumescence from the distended state of the parts\r\nbeneath; the operation is simple, and requires no skill on the part\r\nof the operator. On its first appearance the gum comes forth white as\r\nmilk, and according to its degree of fluidity, finds its way to the\r\nground, or concretes on the branch near the place from which it first\r\nissued, from whence it is collected by men and boys employed to look\r\nafter the trees by the different families who possess the land in which\r\nthey grow.” According to Captain Miles,[543] the drug is not collected\r\nby the people of the country, but by Somalis who cross in numbers from\r\nthe opposite coast, paying the Arab tribes for the privilege. The\r\nArabian Lubân, he says, is considered inferior to the African.\r\n\r\nIt would even appear that the collection of the drug has ceased in\r\nArabia, and that the names of Lubân Maheri or Mascati or Sheehaz,\r\nreferring to the coast of Arabia between Ras Fartak (52° 10′ E.) and\r\nRas Morbas (54° 34′) are now applied to the olibanum brought there from\r\nthe opposite African coast.[544] Hildebrandt informed one of us (letter\r\ndated 26th Dec., 1878) that he has ascertained at Aden, that all the\r\nfrankincense imported in Aden comes from Africa.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Olibanum as found in commerce varies rather considerably\r\nin quality and appearance. It may in general terms be described as a\r\ndry gum-resin, consisting of detached tears up to an inch in length, of\r\nglobular, pear-shaped, clavate, or stalactitic form, mixed with more\r\nor less irregular lumps of the same size. Some of the longer tears are\r\nslightly agglutinated, but most are distinct. The predominant forms are\r\nrounded,—angular fragments being less frequent, though the tears are\r\nnot seldom fissured. Small pieces of the translucent brown papery bark\r\nare often found adhering to the flat pieces. The “Lubân Fasous Bedow”\r\nas exported from the Mijjertheyn district, in the eastern part of the\r\nSomali Country, is in very fine large tears.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the drug is pale yellowish or brownish, but the finer\r\nqualities consist of tears which are nearly colourless or have a\r\ngreenish hue. The smallest grains only are transparent, the rest are\r\ntranslucent and somewhat milky, and not transparent even after the\r\nremoval of the white dust with which they are always covered. But if\r\nheated to about 94° C., they become almost transparent. When broken\r\nthey exhibit a rather dull and waxy surface. Examined under the\r\npolarizing microscope no trace of crystallization is observable.\r\n\r\nOlibanum softens in the mouth; its taste is terebinthinous and slightly\r\nbitter, but by no means disagreeable. Its odour is pleasantly aromatic,\r\nbut is only fully developed when the gum-resin is exposed to an\r\nelevated temperature. At 100° C. the latter softens without actually\r\nfusing, and if the heat be further raised decomposition begins.\r\n\r\n[542] See my paper on Luban Mati and Olibanum, _Pharm. Journ._ viii.\r\n(1878) 805, also Hildebrandt’s note in the “Sitzungs-Bericht der\r\nGesellschaft naturforschender Freunde zu Berlin,” 19th Nov. 1878,\r\n195.—F. A. F..\r\n\r\n[543] _Loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[544] _On the neighbourhood of Bunder Murayah_, in _Journ. of R.\r\nGeograph. Society_, xxii. (1872) 65.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Cold water quickly changes olibanum into a soft\r\nwhitish pulp, which when rubbed down in a mortar forms an emulsion.\r\nImmersed in spirit of wine, a tear of olibanum is not altered much\r\nin form, but it becomes of an almost pure opaque white. In the first\r\ncase the water dissolves the gum, while in the second the alcohol\r\nremoves the resin. We find that pure olibanum treated with spirit\r\nof wine leaves 27 to 35 of gum,[545] which forms a thick mucilage\r\nwith three parts of water. Dissolved in 5 parts of water it yields a\r\nneutral solution, which is precipitated by perchloride of iron as well\r\nas by silicate of sodium, but not by neutral acetate of lead. It is\r\nconsequently a gum of the same class as gum arabic, if not identical\r\nwith it. Its solution contains the same amount of lime as gum arabic\r\naffords.\r\n\r\nThe resin of olibanum has been examined by Hlasiwetz (1867), according\r\nto whom it is a uniform substance having the composition C₂₀H₃₀O₃.\r\nWe find that it is not soluble in alkalis, nor have we succeeded in\r\nconverting it into a crystalline body by the action of dilute alcohol.\r\nIt is not uniformly distributed throughout the tears; if they are\r\nbroken after having been acted upon by dilute alcohol, it now and\r\nthen happens that a clear stratification is perceptible, showing a\r\nconcentric arrangement.\r\n\r\nOlibanum contains an essential oil, of which Braconnot (1808) obtained\r\n5 per cent., Stenhouse (1840) 4 per cent., and Kurbatow (1871-1874) 7\r\nper cent. According to Stenhouse it has a sp. gr. of 0·866, a boiling\r\npoint of 179·4° C., and an odour resembling that of turpentine but more\r\nagreeable. Kurbatow separated this oil into two portions, the one of\r\nwhich has the formula C₁₀H₁₆, boils at 158° C., and combines with HCl\r\nto form crystals; the other contains oxygen. The bitter principle of\r\nolibanum forms an amorphous brown mass.\r\n\r\nThe resin of olibanum submitted to destructive distillation affords no\r\numbelliferone. Heated with strong nitric acid it develops no peculiar\r\ncolour, but at length camphretic acid (see Camphor) is formed, which\r\nmay be also obtained from many resins and essential oils if submitted\r\nto the same oxidizing agent.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The olibanum of Arabia is shipped from several small places\r\nalong the coast between Damkote and Al Kammar, but the quantity\r\nproduced in this district is much below that furnished by the Somali\r\nCountry in Eastern Africa. The latter is brought to Zeyla, Berbera,\r\nBunder Murayah, and many smaller ports, whence it is shipped to Aden\r\nor direct to Bombay. The trade is chiefly in the hands of Banians, and\r\nthe great emporium for the drug is Bombay. A certain portion is shipped\r\nthrough the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb to Jidda,—Von Kremer[546] says to\r\nthe value of £12,000 annually. The quantity exported from Bombay in the\r\nyear 1872-73 was 25,100 cwt., of which 17,446 cwt. were shipped to the\r\nUnited Kingdom, and 6,184 cwt. to China.[547]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—As a medicine olibanum is nearly obsolete, at least in Britain.\r\nThe great consumption of the drug is for the incense used in the Roman\r\nCatholic and Greek Churches.\r\n\r\n[545] I obtained 32·14 per cent. from the finest tears of the kind\r\ncalled Fasous Bedowi, with which I was presented by Capt.

Here the myrrh trees form\r\nthe underwood of the forests of _Acacia_, _Moringa_, and _Euphorbia_.\r\nNees von Esenbeck who examined these specimens, drew up from them a\r\ndescription of what he called _Balsamodendron Myrrha_, which he figured\r\nin 1828.[548]\r\n\r\nAfter Ehrenberg’s herbarium had been incorporated in the Royal\r\nHerbarium of Berlin, Berg examined these specimens, and came to\r\nthe conclusion that they consist of _two species_, namely that\r\ndescribed and figured by Nees, and a second to which was attached\r\n(_correctly_ we must hope) two memoranda bearing the following\r\nwords:—“_Ipsa Myrrhæ arbor ad Gison,—Martio_,” and “_Ex huic simillima\r\narbore ad Gison ipse Myrrham effluentem legi_.[549] _Hæc specimina\r\nlecta sunt in montibus Djara et Kara Februario._” This plant Berg\r\nnamed _B. Ehrenbergianum_.[550] Oliver in his _Flora of Tropical\r\nAfrica_ (1868)[551] is disposed to consider Berg’s plant the same\r\nas _B. Opobalsamun_ Kth., a tree or shrub yielding myrrh, found by\r\nSchweinfurth on the Bisharrin mountains in Abyssinia, not far from the\r\ncoast between Suakin and Edineb. But Schweinfurth himself does not\r\nadmit the identity of the two plants.[552] It is certain, however, that\r\nthe myrrh of commerce is chiefly of African origin.\r\n\r\nCaptain F. M. Hunter, Assistant Resident of Aden, informed us[553]\r\nthat the Arabian myrrh tree, the _Didthin_, is found not only in the\r\nsouthern provinces of Arabia, Yemen, and Hadramant, probably also in\r\nthe southern part of Oman, but likewise on the range of hills which,\r\non the African shore, runs parallel to the Somali coast. The Somalis\r\nwho gather the myrrh in Arabia allege that the Arabian “Didthin”\r\nis identical with that of their own district. Its exudation is the\r\ntrue myrrh, “_Mulmul_” of the Somalis, the “_Mur_” of the Arabs, or\r\n“_Heerabole_”[554] of the Indians.\r\n\r\n[548] _Plantæ Medicinales_, Düsseldorf, ii.

This is the “_Habaghadi_”\r\nof the Somalis, which is not found in Arabia, nor in the coast range\r\nof the Somali country, but only at a considerable distance from the\r\nsea-shore. Its exudation is the coarse myrrh, habaghadi of the Somalis\r\nand Arabs and “_Baisabole_” of the Indians.\r\n\r\nHildebrandt has collected the didthin, or didin as he writes, in the\r\ncoast range alluded to, that is in the Ahl or Serrut Mountains, where\r\nthe tree is growing on sunny slopes in elevations of 500 to 1,500\r\nmetres. He has ascertained that it is identical with Ehrenberg’s tree,\r\n_Balsamodendron Myrrha_ Nees. It is a low tree of crippled appearance,\r\nattaining not more than 3 metres. This species must therefore be\r\npointed out as the source of true myrrh of the European commerce.\r\n\r\n=History=—(See also further on, Bissabol). Myrrh has been used from the\r\nearliest times together with olibanum as a constituent of incense,[555]\r\nperfumes, and unguents. It was an ingredient of the holy oil used in\r\nthe Jewish ceremonial as laid down by Moses: and it was also one of\r\nthe numerous components of the celebrated _Kyphi_ of the Egyptians,\r\na preparation used in fumigations, medicine, and the process of\r\nembalming, and of which there were several varieties.\r\n\r\nIn the previous article we have pointed out (p. 137) several early\r\nreferences to myrrh in connection with olibanum, in which it is\r\nobservable that the myrrh (when weights are mentioned) is always in\r\nthe smaller quantity. Of the use of the drug in mediæval Europe there\r\nare few notices, but they tend to show that the commodity was rare and\r\nprecious. This myrrh is recommended in the Anglo-Saxon Leech-books[556]\r\nto be used with frankincense in the superstitious medical practice\r\nof the 11th century. In a manuscript of the Monastery of Rheinau,\r\nnear Schaffhausen, Switzerland, we also find that, apparently in the\r\n11th century, myrrh as well as olibanum were used in ordeals in the\r\n“judicium aquæ bullientis.”[557] The drug was also used by the Welsh\r\n“Physicians of Myddfai” in the 13th century. In the Wardrobe accounts\r\nof Edward I. there is an entry under date 6th January, 1299, for\r\ngold, frankincense, and _myrrh_, offered by the king in his chapel on\r\nthat day, it being the Feast of Epiphany.[558] Myrrh again figures\r\nin the accounts of Geoffroi de Fleuri,[559] master of the wardrobe\r\n(_argentier_) to Philippe le Long, king of France, where record is\r\nmade of the purchase of—“4 onces d’estorat calmite” (see Styrax) “et\r\n_mierre_ (myrrh) ... encenz et laudanon,” (Ladanum, the resin of Cistus\r\ncreticus L.)—for the funeral of John, posthumous son of Louis X., A.D.\r\n1316.\r\n\r\nGold, silver, silk, precious stones, pearls, camphor, musk, _myrrh_,\r\nand spices are enumerated[560] as the presents which the Khan of Cathay\r\nsent to Pope Benedict XII. at Avignon about the year 1342. The myrrh\r\ndestined for this circuitous route to Europe[561] was doubtless that\r\nof the Arabian traders, with whom the Chinese had constant intercourse\r\nduring the middle ages. Myrrh in fact is still somewhat largely\r\nconsumed in China.[562]\r\n\r\n[555] Cantic. i 13, iii. 6; Genes. xliii. 11; Exod. ii. 12, 30, xxiii.\r\n34-36; John xix. 39; Mark xv. 23; Proverbs vii. 17.\r\n\r\n[556] Cockayne, _Leechdoms &c. of Early England_, ii.

The ancient Egyptian _Bola_ or _Bal_,\r\nand the Sanskrit _Vola_ are preserved in the Persian and Indian words\r\n_Bol_, _Bola_, and _Heerabol_, well-known names for myrrh.\r\n\r\n_Stacte_ (στακτὴ), a substance often mentioned by the ancients, is said\r\nby Pliny to be a spontaneous liquid exudation of the myrrh tree, more\r\nvaluable than myrrh itself. The author of the Periplus of the Erythrean\r\nSea represents it as exported from Muza in Arabia[563] together with\r\nmyrrh. Theophrastus[564] speaks of myrrh as of two kinds, solid and\r\nliquid. No drug of modern times has been identified with the _stacte_\r\nor _liquid myrrh_ of the ancients: that it was a substance obtainable\r\nin quantity seems evident from the fact that 150 pounds of it, said to\r\nbe the offering of an Egyptian city, were presented to St. Silvester at\r\nRome, A.D. 314-335.[565]\r\n\r\nThe myrrh of the ancients was not always obtained from Arabia. The\r\nauthor of the Periplus,[566] who wrote about A.D. 64, records it to\r\nhave been an export of Abalites, Malao, and Mosyllon (the last named\r\nthe modern Berbera), ancient ports of the African coast outside the\r\nstraits of Bab-el-Mandeb; and he even mentions that it is conveyed by\r\nsmall vessels to the opposite shores of Arabia.\r\n\r\n=Secretion=—Marchand[567] who examined and figured the sections of a\r\nbranch of three years’ growth of _B. Myrrha_, represents the gum-resin\r\nas chiefly deposited in the cortical layers, with a little in the\r\nmedulla.\r\n\r\n=Collection=—By the Somal tribe myrrh is largely collected as it flows\r\nout, incisions, according to Hildebrandt, being never practised.\r\nFrom the information given by Ehrenberg to Nees von Esenbeck,[568]\r\nit appears that myrrh when it first exudes is of an oily and then of\r\na buttery appearance, yellowish white, gradually assuming a golden\r\ntint and becoming reddish as it hardens. It exudes from the bark\r\nlike cherry-tree gum, and becomes dark and of inferior value by age.\r\nAlthough Ehrenberg says that the myrrh he saw was of fine quality, he\r\ndoes not mention it being gathered by the natives.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the localities[569] in which the drug is collected,\r\nCruttenden,[570] who visited the Somali coast in 1843, says that myrrh\r\nis brought from the Wadi Nogâl, south west of Cape Gardafui, and from\r\nMurreyhan, Ogadain and Agahora; and that some few trees are found on\r\nthe mountains behind Bunder Murayah. Major Harris[571] saw the myrrh\r\ntree in the Adel desert and in the jungle of the Háwash, on the way\r\nfrom Tajura to Shoa.\r\n\r\n[563] Vincent, _Commerce of the Ancients_, ii.

It is generally brought to the great\r\nfair of Berbera held in November, December, and January, where it is\r\npurchased by the Banians of India, and shipped for Bombay.\r\n\r\nIt appears that all these informations rather refer to the Bisabol or\r\nHabaghadi variety of myrrh; only the first notice, due to Hildebrandt,\r\napplies to true myrrh.\r\n\r\nMyrrh trees abound on the hills about Shugra and Sureea in the\r\nterritory of the Fadhli or Fudthli tribe, lying to the eastward of\r\nAden; myrrh is collected from them by Somalis who cross from the\r\nopposite coast for the purpose and pay a tribute for the privilege to\r\nthe Arabs, who appear to be scarcely acquainted with this drug.[573]\r\nBut a sample of it, received by one of us from Vaughan in 1852, and\r\nothers we have since seen in London (and easily, recognized), proved\r\nit to be somewhat different from typical myrrh, and it is probably\r\nafforded by another species than Balsamodendron Myrrha.\r\n\r\nIt would thus appear that there are three different trees affording\r\nmyrrh, namely that just alluded to, secondly the “Habaghadi,” and\r\nthirdly that growing east of Aden.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Myrrh consists of irregular roundish masses, varying\r\nin size from small grains up to pieces as large as an egg, and\r\noccasionally much larger. They are of an opaque reddish-brown with\r\ndusty dull surface. When broken, they exhibit a rough or waxy fracture,\r\nhaving a moist and unctuous appearance, especially when pressed, and\r\na rich brown hue. The fractured, translucent surface often displays\r\ncharacteristic whitish marks which the ancients compared to the\r\nlight mark at the base of the finger-nails. Myrrh has a peculiar and\r\nagreeable fragrance with an aromatic, bitter, and acrid taste. It\r\ncannot be finely powdered until deprived by drying of some of its\r\nessential oil and water; nor when heated does it melt like colophony.\r\n\r\nWater disintegrates myrrh, forming a light brown emulsion, which viewed\r\nunder the microscope appears made up of colourless drops, among which\r\nare granules of yellow resin. Alcohol dissolves the resin of myrrh,\r\nleaving angular non-crystalline particles of gum[574] and fragments of\r\nbark.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Myrrh is a mixture, in very varying proportions,\r\nof resin, mucilaginous matters, and essential oil. A fine specimen of\r\nmyrrh from the Somali coast, with which Captain Hunter, in 1877, kindly\r\npresented one of us, yielded 27 per cent. of resin. The undissolved\r\nportion is partly soluble in water.\r\n\r\n[572] _Pharm. Journ._ xii. (1853) 226.\r\n\r\n[573] Capt. S. B. Miles, in _Journ. of R. Geograph._ Soc. xli. (1871)\r\n236. The country visited by Miles and Munzinger is the “Smyrnifera\r\nregio exterior,” the outer country producing myrrh of the ancients,\r\nabout 14° 10′ N. lat. and 57° E. long. See also Sprenger, _Alte\r\nGeographie Arabiens_, 313.\r\n\r\n[574] Druggists who prepare large quantities of Tincture of Myrrh may\r\nutilize this gum for making a common sort of mucilage.—_Pharm. Journ._\r\n10 June, 1871, 1001.\r\n\r\nThe resin dissolves completely in chloroform or alcohol, and the\r\ncolour of the latter solution is but slightly darkened by perchloride\r\nof iron. It is but partially soluble in alkalis or in bisulphide of\r\ncarbon. Brückner (1867) found this portion to yield 75·6 per cent. of\r\ncarbon and 9·5 of hydrogen. The resin which the bisulphide refuses to\r\ndissolve, is freely soluble in ether. It contains only 57·4 per cent.\r\nof carbon. The resin of myrrh to which, when moistened with alcohol, a\r\nsmall quantity of concentrated nitric or hydrochloric acid is added,\r\nassumes a violet hue, but far less brilliant than that displayed\r\nby resin of galbanum when treated in a similar manner. But a most\r\nintensely violet liquid may be obtained by adding bromine to the resin\r\ndissolved in bisulphide of carbon. If the resin of myrrh as afforded\r\nby alcohol is warmed with petroleum (boiling at 70° C.), only a small\r\namount of resin is dissolved. This liquid becomes turbid if vapours of\r\nbromine are added; a violet flocculent matter deposits, whereas the\r\njust above-mentioned solution in the bisulphide continues clear on\r\naddition of bromine.\r\n\r\nThe resin of myrrh is not capable of affording umbelliferone like that\r\nof galbanum. By melting it with potash, pyrocatechin and protocatechuic\r\nacid are produced in small amount.\r\n\r\nMyrrh yields on distillation a volatile oil which in operating on 25\r\nlb. of the drug, we obtained to the extent of ¾ per cent.[575] It is a\r\nyellowish, rather viscid liquid, neutral to litmus, having a powerful\r\nodour of myrrh and sp. gr. 0·988 at 13° C.[576] In a column 50 mm.\r\nlong, it deviates a ray of light 30·1° to the left. By submitting it\r\nto distillation, we obtained before the oil boiled, a few drops of\r\na strongly acid liquid having the smell of formic acid. Neutralized\r\nwith ammonia, this liquid produced in solution of mercurous nitrate a\r\nwhitish precipitate which speedily darkened, thus indicating formic\r\nacid, which is developed in the oil. Old myrrh is in fact said to\r\nyield an acid distillate. The oil begins to boil at about 266° C., and\r\nchiefly distills over between 270° and 290°.\r\n\r\nOn combustion in the usual way it afforded carbon 84·70, hydrogen 9·98.\r\nHaving been again rectified in a current of dry carbonic acid, it had\r\na boiling point of 262-263° C., and now afforded[577] carbon 84·70,\r\nhydrogen 10·26, which would nearly answer to the formula C₂₂H₃₂O. The\r\nresults of Ruickholdt’s analysis (1845) of essential oil of myrrh\r\nassign it the formula C₁₀H₁₄O, which is widely different from that\r\nindicated by our experiments.\r\n\r\nThe oil which we rectified displays a faintly greenish hue; it is\r\nmiscible in every proportion with bisulphide of carbon, the solution\r\nexhibiting at first no peculiar coloration when a drop of nitric or\r\nsulphuric acid is added. Yet the mixture to which nitric acid (1·20)\r\nhas been added, assumes after an hour or two a fine violet hue which\r\nis very persistent, enduring even if the liquid is allowed to dry up\r\nin a large capsule. If to the crude oil dissolved in bisulphide of\r\ncarbon bromine be added, a violet hue is produced; and if the solution\r\nis allowed to evaporate, and the residue diluted with spirit of wine,\r\nit assumes a fine blue which disappears on addition of an alkali. The\r\noil is not much altered by boiling with alcoholic potash, nor does it\r\ncombine with alkaline bisulphites.\r\n\r\n[575] Ruickholdt got 2·18 per cent.; Bley and Diesel (1845) from 1·6 to\r\n3·4 per cent. of an acid oil. We are kindly informed by Mr. Fritzsche\r\nof Leipzig (Messrs. Schimmel & Co.) that good myrrh distilled on a\r\nlarge scale yields as much as 4·4 per cent. of oil. (Letter dated 13th\r\nJune, 1878.)\r\n\r\n[576] Gladstone (1863) found the oil a little _heavier_ than water.\r\n\r\n[577] Analyses performed in my laboratory by Dr. Buri, February,\r\n1874. See also my paper on Carvol, _Pharm. Journ._ vii. (1876) 75, or\r\n_Yearbook of Pharmacy_ (1877) 51—F. A. F.\r\n\r\nThe _Bitter principle_ of myrrh is contained in the resin as extracted\r\nby alcohol. By exhausting the resin with warm water an acid brown\r\nsolution is obtained, from which a dark, viscid, neutral mass separates\r\nif the liquid is concentrated; it is contaminated with a large amount\r\nof inorganic matter, from which it may be purified by means of ether.\r\nYet the latter affords also but an amorphous, somewhat brittle brown\r\nsubstance, softening at 80°-90° C. This bitter principle reminds us\r\nof that mentioned in our article Elemi, page 151; it is but sparingly\r\nsoluble in water; the yellowish solution is intensely bitter. The\r\nbitter principle of myrrh appears to be a glucoside. We have not\r\nsucceeded in preparing it in a more satisfactory state.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Myrrh is chiefly shipped by way of Berbera to Aden, and\r\nthence either to Europe or to Bombay. The exports of Aden in the fiscal\r\nyear 1875 to 1876 were 1439 cwt.; one-half of which went to Bombay, one\r\nthird to the United Kingdom.[578]\r\n\r\nThe bags or bales which contain the myrrh are opened in Bombay, and the\r\ndrug is sorted. The better portion goes to Europe, the refuse to China,\r\nwhere it is probably used as an incense.[579]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Myrrh, though much used, does not appear to possess any very\r\nimportant medicinal powers, and is chiefly employed on account of its\r\nbitter, aromatic properties.\r\n\r\n=Other Varieties of Myrrh=—Though the myrrh of commerce exhibits some\r\ndiversity of appearance, the drug-brokers and druggists of London are\r\nnot in the habit of applying any special designations to the different\r\nqualities. There are however two varieties which deserve notice.\r\n\r\n1. _Bissa Bol_ (_Bhesabol_, _Bysabole_), _Habaghadi_ or _Hebbakhade_ of\r\nthe Somalis, formerly called _East India Myrrh_.[580]\r\n\r\nThis drug is of African origin, but of the plant which yields it\r\nnothing is known. Vaughan[581] who sent a sample from Aden to one of\r\nus in 1852, was told by the natives that the tree from which it is\r\ncollected resembles that affording _Heera Ból_ or true myrrh, but that\r\nit is nevertheless distinct. The drug is exported from the whole Somali\r\ncoast to Mokha, Jidda, Aden, Makulla, the Persian Gulf, India and even\r\nChina.[582] Bombay official returns show that the quantity imported\r\nthither in the year 1872-73, was 224 cwt, all shipped from Aden.\r\n\r\nSome myrrh, no doubt that from the interior of north-eastern Africa,\r\nthe Habaghadi or Baisabole, finds its way by the country of the\r\nWagadain (Ugahden or Ogadain) to the small port of Brava (Barawa,\r\nBraoua), about 1° N. lat., and to Zanzibar.[583] This is, possibly,\r\nalso the “_Mirra fina_” which is stated, about the year 1502, by Tomé\r\nLopez to be collected (?) in the island of “Monzambiche.”[584]\r\n\r\n[578] Information obligingly supplied by Captain Hunter, July 1877.\r\n\r\n[579] Dymock, _Pharm. Journ._ vi. (1876) 661.\r\n\r\n[580] _Myrrha indica_, Martiny, _Encyklop. der med-pharm._\r\n_Rohwaarenkunde_, ii. (1854) 98, 101.\r\n\r\n[581] _Pharm. Journ._ xii. (1853) 227.\r\n\r\n[582] In 1865, 10 packages of this drug containing about 15 cwt. were\r\nconsigned to me for sale in London by a friend in China, who had\r\npurchased the drug under the notion that it was _true myrrh_. The\r\ncommodity was bad of its kind, and was sold with difficulty at 30_s._\r\nper cwt.—D. H.\r\n\r\n[583] Guillain, _Documents sur l’histoire, la géogr. et le commerce de\r\nl’Afrique orientale_ iii. (1856) 350.\r\n\r\n[584] In Ramusio (see Appendix, R) 239.\r\n\r\nAccording to Vaughan, Bissa Bôl is mixed with the food given to milch\r\ncows and buffaloes in order to increase the quantity and improve the\r\nquality of their milk, and that it is also used as size to impart a\r\nbright gloss to whitewashed walls.\r\n\r\nMiles mentions[585] that myrrh, called there _hodthai_, is only used\r\nin the Somali country, by men to whiten their shields (by means of an\r\nemulsion made with the drug), by women to cleanse their hair. Probably\r\nhodthai and habaghadi is one and the same thing.\r\n\r\nBissa Bôl differs from myrrh in its stronger, almost acrid _taste_\r\nand in _odour_, which, when once familiar is easily recognizable;\r\nfine specimens of the former have the outward characters of myrrh\r\nand perhaps are often passed off for it. A good sample of “coarse”\r\nhabaghadi myrrh as sent in 1877 by Captain Hunter from Aden proved\r\nto contain but very little resin. This resin is manifestly different\r\nfrom that of myrrh as already shown by its paler, more reddish colour.\r\nThe resin of Bissa Bôl moreover is but very sparingly soluble in\r\nbisulphide of carbon; this solution is _not altered_ by bromine, that\r\nof true myrrh, as above stated, assuming a most intense violet colour\r\non addition of bromine. Nor is the resin of habaghadi soluble in\r\npetroleum ether. Of the gummy substance, which is by far the prevailing\r\nconstituent of this drug, a small portion only is soluble in water.\r\nThese extremely marked differences no doubt depend upon a widely\r\ndiscrepant composition of the resins of the two kinds of myrrh as well\r\nas upon a different proportion of gum and resin. The Bissa Bôl usually\r\nseen is an impure and foul substance, which is regarded by London\r\ndruggists as well as by the Banian traders in India as a very inferior\r\ndark sort of myrrh.\r\n\r\n2. _Arabian Myrrh_—The drug we have mentioned at p. 143 as collected to\r\nthe eastward of Aden, is of interest as substantiating the statement of\r\nTheophrastus that both olibanum and myrrh grow in Southern Arabia.\r\n\r\nThe drug, which is not distinguished by any special name in English\r\ntrade, is in irregular masses seldom exceeding 1½ inches long, and\r\nhaving a somewhat gummy-looking exterior. The larger lumps seem formed\r\nby the cohesion of small, rounded, translucent, externally shining\r\ntears or drops. The fracture is like that of common myrrh, but less\r\nunctuous and wants the whitish markings. The odour and taste are those\r\nof the ordinary drug. Pieces of a semi-transparent papery bark are\r\nattached to some of the lumps. We extracted the resin of a sample of\r\nthis myrrh from the territory of the Fadhli, as sent to us by Captain\r\nHunter. Its solution in bisulphide of carbon or petroleum ether was\r\ncoloured by bromine as stated above, (p. 144) with regard to typical\r\nmyrrh (Heerabol) from the Somali Country. The name applies to myrrh\r\nfrom the vicinity of Ras Morbat in the same region. But the resin of\r\nanother kind of Arabian myrrh, for which we are likewise indebted to\r\nCaptain Hunter, is _not coloured_ when treated in the same way. This is\r\nthe myrrh “Hodaidia Jebeli” from north and north-western Yenen.\r\n\r\n[585] _Journ. of the R. Geogr. Soc._ 22 (1872) 64.\r\n\r\n\r\nELEMI.\r\n\r\n_Resina Elemi_; _Elemi_; F. _Résine Elemi_; G. _Elemiharz_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—The resin known in pharmacy as _Elemi_ is derived\r\nfrom a tree growing in the Philippines, which Blanco,[586] a botanist\r\nof Manila, described in 1845 under the name of _Icica Abilo_, but which\r\nis completely unknown to the botanists of Europe. Blanco’s description\r\nis such that, if correct, the plant cannot be placed in either of the\r\nold genera _Icica_ or _Elaphrium_, comprehended by Bentham and Hooker\r\nin that of _Bursera_, nor yet in the allied genus _Canarium_; in fact\r\neven the order to which it belongs is somewhat doubtful.[587]\r\n\r\nThe tree grows in the province of Batangas in the island of Luzon\r\n(south of Manila), where its name in the Tagala language is _ábilo_;\r\nthe Spaniards call it _Arbol a brea_, i.e. _pitch-tree_, from the\r\ncircumstance that its resin is used for the caulking of boats.\r\n\r\n=History=—The explicit statements of Theophrastus in the 3rd century\r\nB.C. relative to olibanum have already been mentioned. The same writer\r\nnarrates[588] that a little above Coptus on the Red Sea, no tree is\r\nfound except the acacia (ἀκάνθη) of the desert ... but that on the sea\r\nthere grow laurel (δάϕνη) and olive (ἐλαία), from the latter of which\r\nexudes a substance much valued to make a medicine for the staunching of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThis story appears again in Pliny[589] who says that in Arabia the\r\nolive tree exudes tears which are an ingredient of the medicine called\r\nby the Greeks _Enhæmon_, from its efficacy in healing wounds.\r\n\r\nDioscorides[590] briefly notices the _Gum of the Ethiopian olive_,\r\nwhich he likens to scammony; and the same substance is named by\r\nScribonius Largus[591] who practised medicine at Rome during the 1st\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe writers who have commented on Dioscorides have generally adopted\r\nthe opinion that the exudation of the so-called olive tree of Arabia\r\nand Ethiopia was none other than the substance known to them as\r\n_Elemi_, though, as remarked by Mattioli,[592] the oriental drug thus\r\ncalled by no means well accords with the description left by that\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\n[586] _Flora de Filipians_, segunda impression, Manila, 1845. 256.\r\n\r\n[587] On consulting Mr. A. W. Bennett, who is now studying the\r\n_Burseraceæ_ of India, as to the probable affinities of Blanco’s plant,\r\nwe received from him the following remarks: “I have little hesitation\r\nin pronouncing that from the description, _Icica Abilo_ cannot be\r\na _Canarium_, but what it is, is more difficult to say. The leaves\r\nhaving the lowest pair of leaflets smallest, seems at first sight\r\nvery characteristic of _Canarium_; but the following considerations\r\ntend the other way. 1. The _opposite_ leaves which occur nowhere in\r\n_Burseraceæ_ except in _Amyris_, with which the plant does not agree\r\nin many ways. 2. The _stipellæ_ which are not found anywhere in the\r\norder.—3. The _quinate_ flowers. In all species of _Canarium_ the parts\r\nof the flowers are in threes, including _C. commune_, which according\r\nto Miquel extends to the Philippines. The only exception is _C._\r\n(_Scutinanthe_ Thwaites) _brunneum_, with which it does not agree in,\r\nother respects.\r\n\r\n“The foregoing reasons almost equally exclude _Icica_ (_Bursera_); yet\r\nthe fruit of Blanco’s plant seems so eminently that of a _Burseracea_,\r\nthat I think it must belong to that order, but with some error in the\r\ndescription of the leaves.”\r\n\r\n[588] _Hist. Plant_, lib. iv. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[589] Lib. xii c. 38.\r\n\r\n[590] Lib. i. c. 141.\r\n\r\n[591] _Compositiones Medicament_. cap. 103.\r\n\r\n[592] _Comm. in lib. i, Dioscoridis._\r\n\r\nAs to that name, the earliest mention of it appears in the middle of\r\nthe 15th century. Thus in a list of drugs sold at Frankfort about 1450,\r\nwe find _Gommi Elempnij_.[593] Saladinus,[594] who lived about this\r\nperiod, enumerates _Gumi Elemi_ among the drugs kept by the Italian\r\napothecaries, but we have not met with the name in any other writer\r\nof the school of Salerno. The _Arbolayre_,[595] a herbal supposed to\r\nhave been printed about 1485, gives some account of _Gomme Elempni_,\r\nstating that it is the gum of the lemon tree and not of fennel as some\r\nthink,—that it resembles Male Incense,—and makes an excellent ointment\r\nfor wounds.\r\n\r\nThe name _Enhæmon_[596] of Pliny, also written _Enhæmi_, is probably\r\nthe original form of the word _Animi_, another designation for the same\r\ndrug, though also applied as at the present day to a sort of copal. It\r\nis even possible that the word _Elemi_ has the same origin.[597]\r\n\r\nThis primitive Elemi is in our opinion identical with a peculiar\r\nsort of olibanum known as _Luban Meyeti_, afforded by _Boswellia\r\nFrereana_ Birdwood (p. 135). It has a remarkable resemblance both\r\nin external appearance and in odour to the substance in after-times\r\nimported from America, and which were likened to the elemi and animi\r\nof the Old World. The description of “gummi elemnia” given by Valerius\r\nCordus,[598] the most careful observer of his period, could in our\r\nopinion well apply to _Luban Meyeti_. (See p. 153 further on.)\r\n\r\nThe first reference to Elemi as a production of America comes from\r\nthe pen of Monardes[599] who has a chapter on _Animi and Copal_.\r\nHe describes animi as of a more oily nature than copal, of a very\r\nagreeable odour, and in grains resembling olibanum but of larger size,\r\nand adds that it differs from the animi of the Old World in being less\r\nwhite and clear.\r\n\r\nAt a somewhat later period this resin and some similar substances began\r\nto be substituted for _Elemi_ which had become scarce.[600] Pomet,[601]\r\nwho as a dealer in drugs was a man of practical knowledge, laments that\r\nthis American drug was being sold by some as Elemi, and by others as\r\nAnimi or as Tacamaca. It was however introduced in great plenty, and\r\nat length took the place of the original elemi which became completely\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nAmerican Elemi was in turn discarded in favour of another sort imported\r\nfrom the Philippines. The first mention of this substance is to be\r\nfound among the descriptions accompanied by drawings sent by Father\r\nCamellus to Petiver of London, of the shrubs and trees of Luzon,[602]\r\nin the year 1701. Camellus states that the tree, which from his drawing\r\npreserved in the British Museum appears to us to be a species of\r\n_Canarium_, is very tall and large, that it is called by the Spaniards\r\n_Arbol de la brea_, and that it yields an abundance of odorous resin\r\nwhich is commonly used for pitching boats. Living specimens of the tree\r\ntogether with samples of the resin were brought to Paris from Manila by\r\nthe traveller Perrottet about the year 1820. For the last twenty years\r\nthe resin has been common, and is now imported in large quantities[603]\r\nfor use in the arts, so displacing all other kinds. It has been adopted\r\nas the _Elemi_ of the _British Pharmacopœia_ (1867), and is in fact the\r\nonly variety of elemi now found in English commerce.\r\n\r\n[593] Flückiger, _Die Frankfurter Liste_, Halle, 1873. 7. 16.—“Gumi\r\nelemi” is also found in a similar list of the year 1480, compiled in\r\nthe town of Nördlingen, Bavaria.

By exposure to the air it becomes\r\nharder and acquires a yellow tint. It has a strong and pleasant odour\r\nsuggestive of fennel and lemon, yet withal somewhat terebinthinous.\r\nWhen moistened with spirit of wine, it disintegrates, and examined\r\nunder the microscope is seen to consist partly of acicular crystals. At\r\nthe heat of boiling water the hardened drug softens, and at a somewhat\r\nhigher temperature fuses into a clear resin.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Manila elemi is rich in essential oil. On\r\nsubmitting 28 lb. of it to distillation with water, we obtained 2 lb.\r\n13 oz. (equivalent to 10 per cent.) of a fragrant, colourless, neutral\r\noil, of sp. gr. 0·861 at 15° C. Observed in Wild’s polaristrobometer we\r\nfound it to be strongly dextrogyre.[604] H. Sainte Claire Deville[605]\r\non the other hand has examined an oil of elemi that was strongly\r\nlevogyre. This discrepancy shows that there are among the oils of\r\nvarious kinds of elemi, differences similar to those existing in the\r\noils of turpentine and copaiba. By the action of dry hydrochloric\r\nacid gas, Deville obtained from his oil of elemi a solid crystalline\r\nsubstance, C₁₀H₁₆ + 2 HCl. We failed to produce any such compound from\r\nthe oil of Manila elemi. Our oil of elemi dissolves in bisulphide of\r\ncarbon; when mixed with concentrated sulphuric acid, it becomes thick\r\nand assumes a deep orange colour.\r\n\r\nBy submitting the crude oil to fractional distillation, we separated it\r\ninto six portions, of which the first five were dextrogyre in gradually\r\ndiminishing degree, while the sixth displayed a weak deviation to the\r\nleft.[606] The first portion having been dissolved in four times its\r\nweight of strong sulphuric acid, washed and again distilled, exhibit a\r\ndeviation to the left.[607]\r\n\r\n[604] I observed the following deviations:—\r\n\r\n    In a column of 25 mm from 47°·5 to 70°·5 (deviation 23°).\r\n       ”   ”       50  ”     ”         93°·6 (    ”     46·1).\r\n       ”   ”      100  ”     ”         49°·6 (2·1 + 90 = 92°·1).\r\n     —F.

Thickish yellow    ”       46°·2      ”     1°·4  _left_.\r\n       residue\r\n\r\n[607] From 47°·6 to 46°.\r\n\r\nIf the essential oil of elemi (8 parts) is shaken with alcohol,\r\n0·816 sp. gr. (2 parts), nitric acid, 1·2 sp. gr. (1 part) and\r\nwater (5 parts), the mixture, on exposure to air in a shallow\r\ncapsule soon yields large crystals, which were found to agree\r\ncrystallographically[608] perfectly with terpin, C₁₀H₂₀O₂ + OH₂ from\r\noil of turpentine.\r\n\r\nMaujean,[609] a French pharmacien, examined Manila elemi as long\r\nago as 1821 and proved it to contain two resins, the one soluble in\r\ncold, the other only in hot spirit of wine. The former, which appears\r\nto constitute by far the prevailing part of all varieties of elemi,\r\nhas not yet been satisfactorily examined. Bonastre[610] a little\r\nlatter made a more complete analysis, showing that the less soluble\r\nresin which he obtained to the extent of 25 per cent. is easily\r\ncrystallizable, and apparently identical with a substance obtainable\r\nin a similar manner from what he regarded as true elemi, which the\r\nManila resin was not then held to be. Baup (1851) gave it the name of\r\n_Amyrin_. According to our experiments, it is readily isolated to the\r\nextent of 20 per cent. when Manila elemi is treated with cold spirit of\r\nwine, in which the crystals of amyrin are but slightly soluble. If the\r\nelemi is pure, the amyrin may be thus obtained (by washing with spirit\r\nand pressure between bibulous paper) in a cake of snowy whiteness,\r\nwhich may be further purified by crystallization from boiling alcohol.\r\nThe fusing point of the crystals is 177° C.; their composition has been\r\nascertained by Buri[611] to agree with the formula C₂₅H₄₂O, which may\r\nbe written thus: (C₅H₈)₅ OH₂. Amyrin at 16° C. dissolves in 27·5 parts\r\nof alcohol 0·816 sp. gr., being readily soluble also in all the usual\r\nsolvents for resins. The alcoholic solution is slightly dextrogyre.\r\nAmyrin is a neutral substance, and may be sublimed in small quantities\r\nby very carefully heating it.\r\n\r\nBy heating amyrin with zinc dust Ciamician[612] obtained chiefly\r\ntoluol, methyl-ethyl-benzol and ethyl-naphtalin.\r\n\r\nBy allowing an alcoholic solution of the amorphous resin of Manila\r\nelemi[613] to evaporate, Baup obtained in very small quantity crystals\r\nof _Bréine_, a substance fusing at 187° C., which he considered to\r\nbe distinct from amyrin. In our opinion it was impure amyrin; it is\r\nextremely difficult, or rather practically impossible to extract all\r\nthe crystallizable resin from the amorphous. If the latter, perfectly\r\ntransparent, is kept for several years, an elegant crystallization at\r\nlast begins to make its appearance throughout the bulk of the resin.\r\n\r\nBaup further extracted from Manila elemi a crystallizable substance\r\nsoluble in water to which he gave the name of _Bryoidin_,[614] and\r\nin smaller quantity a second also soluble in water which he called\r\n_Bréidine_. From the experiments of Baup it appears that bryoidin is\r\nsoluble in 360 parts of water at 10° C., and melts at 135° C.; whereas\r\nbréidine requires for solution 260 parts of water and fuses at a\r\ntemperature not much over 100° C.\r\n\r\n[608] Examined at my request by Prof. Groth.—F.

(1876) 157, also _Yearbook of Ph._ 1877. 21.\r\n\r\n[612] _Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft_, 1878. 1347.\r\n\r\n[613] I am indebted for a specimen of the material that Baup worked\r\nupon and which he called _Resin of Arbol a brea_, to M. Roux,\r\npharmacien of Nyon, Switzerland—F. A. F.\r\n\r\n[614] From the Greek βρύον, in allusion to the moss-like aspect\r\nsometimes assumed by the crystals.\r\n\r\nWe have also obtained _Bryoidin_[615] by operating in the following\r\nmanner: the watery liquid left in the still after the distillation of\r\n28 lb. of Manila elemi was poured off from the mass of hard resin,\r\nand having been duly concentrated, it deposited together with a\r\ndark extractiform matter, colourless acicular crystals of bryoidin.\r\nThe deposit in question having been drained and allowed to dry, the\r\nbryoidin may be separated by boiling water or by cold ether. We found\r\nthe latter the more convenient; it readily takes up the bryoidin\r\ncontaminated only with a little resin. The ethereal solution should\r\nbe allowed to evaporate and the residual crystalline mass boiled in\r\nwater, when the solution (which is colourless), poured off from the\r\nresin, will deposit upon cooling brilliant tufts of acicular crystals\r\nof bryoidin. The boiling in water requires to be several times\r\nrepeated before the whole of the bryoidin can be removed; the latter\r\nsometimes crystallizes as a mossy arborescent growth. Bryoidin is a\r\nneutral substance, of bitter taste, scarcely soluble in cold water,\r\nbut dissolving easily in boiling water, or in alcohol or ether. When\r\na little is placed in a watch-glass, covered with a plate of glass,\r\nand then gently heated over a lamp, it sublimes in delicate needles.\r\nTo obtain it perfectly pure, it is best to sublime it in a current\r\nof dry carbonic acid. Thus purified its fusing point is 133·5 C.;\r\nafter fusion it concretes as a transparent, amorphous mass, which if\r\nimmersed in glycerin and raised to the temperature of 135° C., suddenly\r\ncrystallizes.\r\n\r\nWe have observed that if the filtered mother-liquor of bryoidin after\r\ncomplete cooling and standing for a day or two is warmed, it becomes\r\nturbid and that in a few minutes there separate from it long white\r\nflocks like bits of paper or wool, which do not disappear either by\r\nwarming or by cooling the liquid; under the microscope they are seen\r\nto consist partly of thread-like, partly of acicular crystals. It is\r\npossible this substance is Baup’s _Bréidine_; we found it to fuse at\r\n135° C., to be neutral, and to crystallize from weak alcohol exactly\r\nlike bryoidin. Both it and bryoidin look very voluminous in water, but\r\nare extremely small in weight, and are present in the drug in but a\r\nvery small amount. The composition of bryoidin agrees with the formula\r\nC₂₀H₃₈O₃, which might be written thus (C₅H₈)₄+3OH₂. But it contains\r\nno water of crystallization. In the vapour of dry hydrochloric gas,\r\nbryoidin assumes a fine red colour, turning violet, then blue, and\r\nlastly green. This behaviour is not at all displayed by amyrin.\r\n\r\nThe liquids from which bryoidin is obtained contain an amorphous\r\nbrown substance of intensely bitter taste, at the same time somewhat\r\naromatic. It is decomposed by dilute mineral acids, evolving a very\r\npeculiar strong odour.\r\n\r\nBuri[616] isolated from Manila Elemi an extremely small amount of\r\n_Elemic acid_, C₃₅H₅₆O₄. It is in very brilliant crystals, much larger\r\nthan those of the other constituents of elemi. Although we have before\r\nus some prisms of the acids several millimetres long, it has been found\r\nimpossible to ascertain their crystallographic character, each of the\r\nprisms being formed of very intimately aggregated crystals. Elemic acid\r\nmelts at 215° C.; its alcoholic solution decidedly reddens litmus.\r\nElemate of potassium is a crystalline salt.\r\n\r\n[615] Flückiger, _Pharm. Journ._ v. (1874) 142.\r\n\r\n[616] _Pharm. Journ._ viii. (1878) 601.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the substances hitherto isolated from elemi may\r\nperhaps be given thus:—\r\n\r\n    Essential oil,         C₅H₈.\r\n    Amyrin,               (C₅H₈)₅ + OH₂\r\n    Amorphous resin (?)   (C₅H₈)₂ + OH₂\r\n    Bryoidin,             (C₅H₈)₄ + 3OH₂\r\n    Elemic acid,          (C₅H₈)₇ + O₄\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Elemi is scarcely used in British medicine except in the form of\r\nan ointment, sometimes prescribed as a stimulating application to old\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\n=Other sorts of Elemi=—1. _Mexican Elemi_, _Vera Cruz Elemi_—This drug,\r\nwhich used to be imported into London about thirty years ago, but which\r\nhas now disappeared from commerce, is the produce of a tree named by\r\nRoyle _Amyris elemifera_ growing at Oaxaca in Mexico.[617] It is a\r\nlight yellow, or whitish, brittle resin occurring in semi-cylindrical\r\nscraped pieces, or in irregular fragments which are sometimes\r\ntranslucent but more often dull and opaque. It easily softens in the\r\nmouth so that it may be masticated, and has an agreeable terebinthinous\r\nodour. Treated with cold spirit of wine (·828), it breaks down into a\r\nwhite magma of acicular crystals (_Amyrin_?).\r\n\r\n2. _Brazilian Elemi_—Was described as long ago as 1658 by the traveller\r\nPiso, as a substance completely resembling the elemi of the Old World\r\nand applicable to the same purposes. It is the produce of several\r\ntrees described as species of _Icica_, as _I. Icicariba_ DC.,[618] _I.\r\nheterophylla_ DC., _I. heptaphylla_ Aublet, _I. guianensis_ Aubl., _I.\r\naltissima_ Aubl.—In New Granada a similar exudation[619] is furnished\r\nby _I. Caranna_ H.B.K.\r\n\r\nA specimen in our possession from Pernambuco[620] is a translucent,\r\ngreenish yellow, fragrant, terebinthinous resin, which by cold spirit\r\nof wine may be separated into two portions, the one soluble, the other\r\na mass of colourless acicular crystals. The resin spontaneously exuded\r\nand collected from the trunks, is often opaque and white, grey, or\r\nyellowish, looking not unlike fragments of old mortar. The microscope\r\nshows it to be made up of minute acicular crystals.[621]\r\n\r\n3. _Mauritius Elemi_—Fine specimens of this substance and of\r\n_Colophonia Mauritiana_ DC. the tree affording it, were sent to one of\r\nus (H.) in 1855 by Mr. Emile Fleurot of Mauritius. The resin accords in\r\nits general characters with Manila elemi, like which it leaves after\r\ntreatment with cold spirit of wine, an abundance of crystals resembling\r\namyrin.\r\n\r\n[617] Royle’s very imperfect specimens of this plant are in the British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n[618] Now _Protium Icicariba_ Marchand, in _Flora Brasiliensis_,\r\nfascicul. 65 (1874) tab. liii.\r\n\r\n[619] G. Planchon, _Bulletin de la Soc. Bot. de France_, xv. (1868) 16.\r\n\r\n[620] Given me by Mr. Manley, late of Pernambuco. I have also an\r\nauthentic specimen of the resin of _I. heterophylla_ collected at\r\nSantarem, Pará, by Mr. H. W. Bates in 1853.—D. H.\r\n\r\n[621] For some experiments on the resin of _Icica_, see Gmelin,\r\n_Chemistry_, xvi. (1866) 421.—Also Stenhouse and Groves, in Liebig’s\r\n_Annalen der Chemie_, 180 (1876) 253, on resin and oil of _Icica\r\nheptaphylla_. The former would appear to agree with the formula\r\n(C₅H₈)₉OH₂.\r\n\r\n4. _Luban Meyeti_[622] or _Luban Mati._—This substance, which we claim\r\nto be the _Oriental_ or _African Elemi_ of the older writers, and also\r\none of the resins anciently designated _Animi_,[623] is the exudation\r\nof _Boswellia Frereana_ Birdwood, a remarkable tree gregarious on the\r\nbare limestone hills near Bunder Murayah to the west of Cape Gardafui.\r\nThe tree which is called _Yegaar_ by the natives, is of small stature,\r\nand differs from the other species of _Boswellia_ growing on the same\r\ncoast in having glabrous, glaucous leaves with obtuse leaflets, crisped\r\nat the margin.[624] The bark is smooth, papery, and translucent, and\r\neasily stripped off in thin sheets which are used for writing on.\r\nThough growing wild, the trees are said by Capt. Miles[625] to be\r\ncarefully watched and even sometimes propagated. The resin exudes after\r\nincision in great plenty, soon hardens, and is collected by the Somali\r\ntribes who dispose of it to traders for shipment to Jidda and ports of\r\nYemen: occasionally a package reaches London among the shipments of\r\nolibanum. It is used in the East for chewing like mastich.\r\n\r\nIn modern times Luban Mati has been mentioned by Wellsted in his\r\n“Travels in Arabia” (1838).\r\n\r\n_Luban Meyeti_ occurs in the form of detached droppy tears and\r\nfragments, occasionally in stalactitic masses several ounces in weight.\r\nIt breaks very easily with a brilliant conchoidal fracture, showing an\r\ninternal substance of a pale amber yellow and perfectly transparent.\r\nExternally it is more or less coated with a thin opaque white crust,\r\nwhich seen under the microscope appears non-crystalline. Many of the\r\ntears have pieces of the thin, brown, papery bark adhering to them.\r\nThe resin has an agreeable odour of lemon and turpentine, and a mild\r\nterebinthinous taste.\r\n\r\nTreated with alcohol (·838) it is almost entirely dissolved; the very\r\nsmall undissolved portion is not crystalline. The former agrees with\r\nthe formula C₂₀H₃₀O₂. 20 lb. of Luban Mati yielded us 10 ounces of\r\na volatile oil (= 3·1 per cent.) having a fragrant odour suggestive\r\nof elemi and sp. gr. 0·856 at 17° C. The oil examined in a column\r\n50 millim. long, deviates the ray 2°·5 to the left. By fractional\r\ndistillation we found it to consist of dextrogyre hydrocarbon, C₁₀H₁₆,\r\nmixed with an oxygenated oil which we did not succeed in isolating;\r\nthe latter is evidently lævogyre, and exists in proportion more than\r\nsufficient to overcome the weak dextrogyre power of the hydrocarbon.\r\n\r\nThere is no gum in this exudation; it is therefore essentially\r\ndifferent from olibanum, the product of closely allied species of\r\n_Boswellia_.[626]\r\n\r\n[622] _Lubán_ is the general Arabic name for olibanum: _meyeti_ perhaps\r\nfrom Jebel Meyet, a mountain of 1200 feet on the Somali Coast in long.\r\n47° 10′.\r\n\r\n[623] By the assistance of Professor G. Planchon we have ascertained\r\nthat it is identically the same substance as described by Guibourt\r\nunder the name _Tacamaque jaune huileuse_ A.—_Hist. des Drogues_, iii.\r\n(1850) 483.\r\n\r\n[624] Figured in Birdwood’s paper, _Trans.

Azadirachta_ L.,\r\n_Azadirachta indica_ Juss.), an ornamental tree, 40 to 50 feet high\r\nand attaining a considerable girth,[627] well known throughout India\r\nby its Hindustani name of _Nim_, or by its Portuguese appellation of\r\n_Margosa_.[628] It is much planted in avenues, but occurs wild in the\r\nforests of Southern India, Ceylon and the Malay Archipelago, as far as\r\nJava.[629]\r\n\r\nThe hard and heavy wood which is so bitter that no insect will attack\r\nit, the medicinal leaves and bark, the fruit which affords an acrid\r\nbitter oil used in medicine and for burning, the gum which exudes from\r\nthe stem, and finally a sort of toddy obtained from young trees, cause\r\nthe _Nim_ to be regarded as one of the most useful trees of India.\r\n\r\n_M. indica_ is often confounded with _M. Azedarach_ L., a native of\r\nChina,[630] and probably of India, now widely distributed throughout\r\nthe warmer regions of the globe, and not rare even in Sicily and\r\nother parts of the south of Europe. The former has an oval fruit (by\r\nabortion) one-celled and one-seeded, and leaves simply pinnate. The\r\nlatter has the fruit five-celled, and leaves bipinnate.\r\n\r\n=History=—The tree under the Sanskrit name of _Nimba_ is mentioned\r\nin Susruta, one of the most ancient Hindu medical writings, composed\r\nperhaps about the 10th century of our era.\r\n\r\nIn common with many other productions of India, it attracted the\r\nnotice of Garcia de Orta, physician to the Portuguese viceroy at Goa,\r\nand he published an account of it in his work on drugs in 1563.[631]\r\nChristoval Acosta[632] in 1578 supplied some further details and also a\r\nfigure of the tree. The tonic properties of the bark, long recognized\r\nby the native physicians of India, were successively tested by Dr. D.\r\nWhite of Bombay in the beginning of the present century, and have since\r\nbeen generally admitted.[633] The drug has a place in the _Pharmacopœia\r\nof India_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The bark in our possession[634] is in coarse fibrous\r\npieces about ⅕ of an inch thick and 2 to 3 inches wide, slightly\r\nchannelled. The suberous coat is rough and cracked, and of a greyish\r\nrusty hue. The inner surface is of a bright buff and has a highly\r\nfoliaceous structure. On making a transverse section three distinct\r\nlayers may be observed—firstly the suberous coat exhibiting a large\r\nbrown parenchyme interwoven with small bands of corky tissue,—secondly\r\na dark cellular layer, and then the foliaceous liber. The dry bark is\r\ninodorous and has a slightly astringent bitter taste.\r\n\r\n[627] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Medic. Plants_, part 27.\r\n\r\n[628] From _amargoso_, bitter.\r\n\r\n[629] C.

This latter however is not always met with,\r\nsecondary bands of cork (_rhytidoma_) frequently taking its place. The\r\nliber is commonly built up of strong fibre-bundles traversed by narrow\r\nmedullary rays, and transversely separated by bands of parenchymatous\r\nliber tissue. Crystals of oxalate of calcium occur in the parenchyme\r\nmore frequently than the small globular starch grains. The structure of\r\nthe bark varies considerably according to the gradual development of\r\nthe secondary cork-bands.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Margosa bark was chemically examined in India by\r\nCornish[635] (1856), who announced it as a source of a bitter alkaloid\r\nto which he gave the name of _Margosine_, but which he obtained only\r\nin minute quantity as a “_double salt of Margosine and Soda_” in long\r\nwhite needles.\r\n\r\nFrom the bitter oil of the seeds he isolated a substance which he\r\ncalled _Margosic Acid_, and which he doubted to be capable of affording\r\ncrystallizable salts. The composition neither of this acid nor of\r\nmargosine is known, nor have the properties of either been investigated.\r\n\r\nThe small sample of the bark at our disposal only enables us to\r\nadd that an infusion produced with perchloride of iron a blackish\r\nprecipitate, and that an infusion is not altered by tannic acid or\r\niodohydrargyrate of potassium. If the inner layers of the bark are\r\nalone exhausted with water, the liquid affords an abundant precipitate\r\nwith tannic acid; but if the _entire_ bark is boiled in water, the\r\ntannic matter which it contains will form an insoluble compound with\r\nthe bitter principle, and prevent the latter being dissolved. It is\r\nthus evident that to isolate the bitter matter of the bark, it would\r\nbe advisable to work on the liber or inner layers alone, which might\r\nreadily be done, as they separate easily.\r\n\r\nAccording to the recent researches of Broughton[636] the bitter\r\nprinciple is an amorphous resin soluble in the usual solvents and in\r\nboiling solutions of fixed alkalis. From the latter it is precipitated\r\nby acids, yet, probably, altered. Broughton ascribed the formula\r\nC₃₆H₅₀O₁₁ to this bitter resin purified by means of bisulphide of\r\ncarbon, ether and absolute alcohol; it fused at 92° C. He obtained\r\nmoreover a small quantity of a crystallized principle, which he\r\nbelieved to be a fatty body, yet its melting point of 175° C. is not in\r\nfavour of this suggestion.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—In India the bark is used as a tonic and antiperiodic, both by\r\nnatives and Europeans. Dr. Pulney Andy of Madras has found the leaves\r\nbeneficial in small-pox.\r\n\r\n[635] _Indian Annals of Medical Science_, Calcutta, iv. (1857) 104.\r\n\r\n[636] _Madras Monthly Journ. Med.

(_Swietenia\r\nfebrifuga_ Willd.), a tree of considerable size not uncommon in the\r\nforests of Central and Southern India. The timber called by Europeans\r\n_Bastard Cedar_ is very durable and strong, and much valued for\r\nbuilding purposes.\r\n\r\n=History=—The introduction of Rohun Bark into the medical practice\r\nof Europeans is due to Roxburgh[638] who recommended the drug as a\r\nsubstitute for Cinchona, after numerous trials made in India about the\r\nyear 1791. At the same time he sent supplies to Edinburgh, where Duncan\r\nmade it the subject of a thesis[639] which probably led to it being\r\nintroduced into the materia medica of the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia of\r\n1803, and of the Dublin Pharmacopœia of 1807.\r\n\r\nThough thus officially recognized, it does not appear that the bark\r\ncame much into use or by any other means fulfilled the expectations\r\nraised in its favour. At present it is regarded simply as a useful\r\nastringent tonic, and as such it has a place in the _Pharmacopœia of\r\nIndia_ (1868).\r\n\r\n=Description=—Our specimen of Rohun bark[640] which is from a young\r\ntree, is in straight or somewhat curved, half-tubular quills, an inch\r\nor more in diameter and about ⅕ of an inch in thickness. Externally\r\nit is of a rusty grey or brown, with a smoothish surface exhibiting\r\nno considerable furrows or cracks, but numerous small corky warts.\r\nThese form little elliptic scars or rings, brown in the centre and\r\nbut slightly raised from the surface. The inner side and edges of the\r\nquills are of a bright reddish colour.\r\n\r\nA transverse section exhibits a thin outer layer coloured by\r\nchlorophyll, and a middle layer of a bright rusty hue, traversed by\r\nlarge medullary rays and darker wedge-shaped rays of liber. The latter\r\nhas a fibrous fracture, that of the outer part of the bark being\r\nrather corky or foliaceous. The whole bark when comminuted is of a\r\nrusty colour, becoming reddish by exposure to air and moisture. It has\r\na bitter astringent taste with no distinctive odour. The older bark\r\nfrequently half an inch thick and fibrous, has a thick ragged corky\r\nlayer of a rusty blackish-brown colour, deeply fissured longitudinally,\r\nand minutely cracked transversely. Old bark, according to Dymock\r\n(1877), is generally in half quills of a rich red-brown colour.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The bark presents but few structural\r\npeculiarities. The ring of liber is made up of alternating\r\nprosenchymatous and parenchymatous tissue. In the latter the\r\nlarger cells are filled with mucilage, the others with starch. The\r\nprosenchymatous groups of the liber exhibit that peculiar form we have\r\nalready described as _hornbast_ (p. 74); it chiefly contains the tannic\r\nmatter, besides stellate crystals of oxalate of calcium which are\r\ndistributed through the whole tissue of the bark. The medullary rays\r\nare of the usual form, and contain starch granules. The corky coat is\r\nbuilt up of a smaller number of vaulted cells.\r\n\r\n[637] From _Sómida_, the Teluga name of the tree; _Róhan_ is its name\r\nin Hindustani.—Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med.

It does not appear to unite with acids or bases, and is less\r\nsoluble in water containing them than in pure water. It has a very\r\nbitter taste, and refuses to crystallize either from benzol or ether.\r\nIt contains no nitrogen. To this we may add that the bark is rich in\r\ntannic acid.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Rohun bark is administered in India as an astringent tonic\r\nand antiperiodic, and is reported useful in intermittent fevers and\r\ngeneral debility, as well as in the advanced stages of dysentery and in\r\ndiarrhœa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRHAMNACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS RHAMNI.\r\n\r\n_Baccæ Rhamni, Baccæ Spinæ cervinæ; Buckthorn Berries_; F. _Baies de\r\nNeprun_; G. _Kreuzdornbeeren_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Rhamnus cathartica_ L., a robust diœcious shrub\r\nwith spreading branches, the smaller of which often terminate in a\r\nstout thorn. It is indigenous to Northern Africa, the greater part of\r\nEurope, and stretches eastward to the Caucasus and into Siberia. We\r\nhave seen stems 50 years old, having a diameter of 8 inches, sent from\r\nthe government of Cherson, Southern Russia. In England the buckthorn\r\nthough generally distributed is abundant only in certain districts;\r\nin Scotland it occurs wild in but a single locality. Yet in Norway,\r\nSweden, and Finland it grows much further north.\r\n\r\nThe fruit which ripens in the autumn is collected for use chiefly in\r\nthe counties of Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, and also\r\nfrom Wiltshire. The collectors usually prefer to supply the juice as\r\nexpressed by themselves.\r\n\r\n=History=—The Buckthorn was well known to the Anglo-Saxons, and is\r\nmentioned as _Hartsthorn_ or _Waythorn_ in their medical writings and\r\nglossaries dating before the Norman conquest. The Welsh physicians of\r\nMyddfai (“Meddygon Myddvai”) in the 13th century prescribed the juice\r\nof the fruit of buckthorn boiled with honey as an aperient drink.\r\n\r\nAs _Spina Cervina_ the shrub is referred to by Piero de’ Crescenzi of\r\nBologna[643] about A.D. 1305.\r\n\r\n[641] The analysis alluded to in the _Pharm. of India_ (p. 444)\r\nconcerns _Khaya_ (_Swietenia_) _senegalensis_, and not the present\r\nspecies, as my friend Dr. Overbeck has informed me.—F.

Syrup of buckthorn first\r\nappeared in the London Pharmacopœia of 1650; it was aromatized by means\r\nof aniseed, cinnamon, mastich and nutmeg.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruits, which are only used in the fresh state, are\r\nsmall, juicy, spherical drupes the size of a pea, black and shining,\r\nbearing on the summit the remnants of the style, and supported below\r\nby a slender stalk expanded into a disc-like receptacle. Before\r\nripening the fruit is green and distinctly 4-lobed, afterwards smooth\r\nand plump. It contains 4 one-seeded nuts[644] meeting at right angles\r\nin the middle. The seed is erect with a broad furrow on the back: in\r\ntransverse section the albumen and cotyledons are seen to be curved\r\ninto a horseshoe form with the ends directed outwards.\r\n\r\nThe fresh juice is green, has an acid reaction and a sweetish,\r\nafterwards disagreeably bitter taste, and repulsive odour. It is\r\ncoloured dingy green by ferric chloride, yellow by alkalis, red by\r\nacids. According to Umney[645] it should have a sp. gr. of 1·070 to\r\n1·075, but is seldom sold pure. By keeping the juice gradually turns\r\nred.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The epidermis consists of small tabular cells,\r\nfollowed by a row of large cubic cells and then by several layers of\r\ntangentially-extended cells rich in chlorophyll. This thick epicarp\r\npasses into the loose thin-walled and large-celled sarocarp. Besides\r\nchlorophyll it exhibits numerous cells each containing a kind of sac,\r\nwhich may be squeezed out of the cell. These sacs are violet, turning\r\nblue with alkalis. Similar, yet much more conspicuous bodies occur also\r\nin the pulp of the Locust Bean (_Ceratonia Siliqua_ L.).\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The berries of buckthorn and other species\r\nof _Rhamnus_ contain interesting colouring matters, which have been\r\nthe subject of much chemical research and controversy. Winckler\r\nin 1849 extracted from the juice _Rhamnocathartin_, a yellowish\r\nuncrystallizable bitter substance, soluble in water but not in ether.\r\nAlkalis colour it golden yellow; perchloride of iron, dark greenish\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Fleury, a pharmacien of Pontoise, discovered in buckthorn\r\njuice a yellow substance forming cauliflower-like crystals to which\r\nhe gave the name of _Rhamnine_. This body has been recently studied\r\nby Lefort,[646] who identified it with the _Rhamnetine_ of Galletly\r\n(1858) and the _Chrysorhamnine_ of Schützenberger and Bertèche (1865).\r\nThough obtainable from the berries of all kinds of _Rhamnus_ used in\r\ndyeing (including the common buckthorn), it is got most easily and\r\nabundantly from Persian Berries. When pure, and crystallized from\r\nabsolute alcohol, it is described as forming minute yellow translucent\r\ntables. It is scarcely soluble in cold water, though colouring it pale\r\nyellow; is soluble in hot alcohol, insoluble in ether or bisulphide of\r\ncarbon. It is very soluble in caustic alkalis, forming uncrystallizable\r\nreddish-yellow solutions. From alkaline solutions it is precipitated\r\nby a mineral acid in the form of a glutinous magma resembling hydrated\r\nsilica. Lefort assigns to it the formula C₁₂H₁₂O₅ + 2H₂O.\r\n\r\n[644] In _Rh. Frangula_ L., the other British species, the fruit has 2\r\nnuts.\r\n\r\n[645] _Pharm.

(1866) 420.—See also the investigations of Liebermann and Hörmann,\r\n1879.\r\n\r\nThis chemist has likewise found in the berries of _Rhamnus_, though\r\nnot with certainty in those of _R. cathartica_, a neutral substance\r\nisomeric with rhamnine, to which he has given the name of _Rhamnegine_.\r\nUnlike rhamnine it is very soluble in cold water, but in all other\r\nrespects it agrees with that body in chemical and physical properties.\r\nThe two substances have the same taste, almost the same tint, the same\r\ncrystalline form, and lastly they give rise to the same reactions with\r\nchemical agents.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of Lefort have been contested by Stein (1868) and by\r\nSchützenberger (1868), the latter of whom succeeded in decomposing\r\nrhamnegine and proving it a glucoside having the formula C₂₄H₃₂O₁₄. Its\r\ndecomposition gives rise to a body named _Rhamnetin_, C₁₂H₁₀O₅, and\r\na crystallizable sugar isomeric with mannite. Schützenberger admits\r\nthat the berries contain an isomeric modification of rhamnegine; but\r\nin addition another colouring matter insoluble in water, which appears\r\nto be the _Rhamnine_ of Lefort, but to which he assigns a different\r\nformula, namely, C₁₈H₂₂O₁₀. This is also a glucoside capable of\r\nbeing split into rhamnetin and a sugar. There are thus, according to\r\nSchützenberger, two forms of rhamnegine which may be distinguished as α\r\nand β, and there is the substance insoluble in water, named by Lefort\r\n_Rhamnine_.\r\n\r\nThe question of the purgative principles of buckthorn, it will be\r\nobserved, has not been touched by all these researches.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—From the juice of the berries is prepared a syrup having\r\nstrongly purgative properties, much more used as a medicine for animals\r\nthan for man. The pigment _Sap Green_ is also made from the juice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMPELIDEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nUVÆ PASSÆ.\r\n\r\n_Passulæ majores_; _Raisins_; F. _Raisins_; G. _Rosinen_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Vitis vinifera_ L., the Common Grape-vine. It\r\nappears to be indigenous to the Caucasian provinces of Russia, that is\r\nto say, to the country lying between the eastern end of the Black Sea\r\nand the south-western shores of the Caspian; extending thence southward\r\ninto Armenia. Under innumerable varieties, it is cultivated in most of\r\nthe warmer and drier countries of the temperate regions of both the\r\nnorthern and southern hemispheres. Humboldt defines the area of the\r\nprofitable culture of the vine as a zone lying between 36° and 40° of\r\nnorth latitude.\r\n\r\n=History=—The vine is among the oldest of cultivated plants, and\r\nis mentioned in the earliest Mosaic writings. _Dried_ grapes as\r\ndistinguished from _fresh_ were used by the ancient Hebrews, and in\r\nthe Vulgate are translated _Uvæ passæ_.[647] During the middle ages,\r\nraisins were an article of luxury imported into England from Spain.\r\n\r\n[647] Numbers vi. 3; 1 Sam. xxv. 18, xxx. 12; 2 Sam. xvi. 1; 1 Chron.\r\nxii. 40.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The ovary of _Vitis vinifera_ is 2-celled with 2 ovules\r\nin each cell; it develops into a succulent, pedicellate berry of\r\nspherical or ovoid form, in which the cells are obliterated and some of\r\nthe seeds generally abortive. As the fruit is not articulated with the\r\nrachis or the rachis with the branch, it does not drop at maturity but\r\nremains attached to the plant, on which, provided there is sufficient\r\nsolar heat, it gradually withers and dries: such fruits are called\r\n_Raisins of the sun_. Various methods are adopted to facilitate the\r\ndrying of the fruit, such as dipping the bunches in boiling water or in\r\na lye of wood ashes, or twisting or partially severing the stalk,—the\r\neffect of each operation being to arrest or destroy the vitality of\r\nthe tissues. The drying is performed by exposure to the sun, sometimes\r\nsupplemented by artificial heat.\r\n\r\nThe raisins commonly found in the shops are the produce of Spain and\r\nAsia Minor, and are sold either in entire bunches or removed from the\r\nstalk. The former kind, known as _Muscatel Raisins_ and imported from\r\nMalaga, are dried and packed with great care for use as a dessert\r\nfruit. The latter kind, which includes the _Valencia Raisins_ of Spain,\r\nand the _Eleme_, _Chesme_ and stoneless _Sultana Raisins_ of Smyrna,\r\nare used for culinary purposes. For pharmacy, Valencia raisins are\r\ngenerally employed.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The outer layer or skin of the berry is made\r\nup of small tabular cells loaded with a reddish granular matter, which\r\non addition of an alcoholic solution of perchloride of iron assumes a\r\ndingy green hue. The interior parenchyme exhibits large, thin-walled,\r\nloose cells containing an abundance of crystals (bitartrate of\r\npotassium and sugar). There are also some fibro-vascular bundles\r\ntraversing the tissue in no regular order.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The pulp abounds in grape sugar and cream\r\nof tartar, each of which in old raisins may be found crystallized\r\nin nodular masses; it also contains gum and malic acid. The seeds\r\nafford 15 to 18 per cent. of a bland fixed oil, which is occasionally\r\nextracted. Fitz[648] has shown that it consists of the glycerides\r\nof _Erucic Acid_, C₂₂H₄₂O₂, stearic acid, and palmitic acid, the\r\nfirst-named acid largely prevailing. The crystals of erucic acid melt\r\nat 34° C.; by means of fused potash they may be resolved into arachic\r\nacid, C₂₀H₄₀O₂, and acetic acid, C₂H₄O₂.\r\n\r\nThe seeds further contain 5 to 6 per cent. of tannic acid, which also\r\nexists in the skin of the fruit. The latter is likewise the seat of\r\nchlorophyll and other colouring matter.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The consumption of raisins in Great Britain is very large\r\nand is increasing. The imports into the United Kingdom have been as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n        1870.         1871.            1872.             1876.\r\n       365,418       427,056          617,418           583,860 cwt.\r\n    val. £593,527.  val. £707,344.   val. £1,149,337.   val. £1,058,406.\r\n\r\nOf the quantity mentioned for 1872 there were 400,570 cwt. shipped\r\nfrom Spain, 176,500 cwt. from Asiatic Turkey, and the remainder from\r\nother countries.[649] It is stated that Greece, in 1874, exported about\r\n1⅓ millions of cwt., value £28,000,000; much of this was shipped to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n[648] _Berichte der deutsch. chem.

They have no medicinal properties, and are only\r\nused for the sake of the saccharine matter they impart.[650]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANACARDIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASTICHE.\r\n\r\n_Mastix_, _Resina Mastiche_; _Mastich_; F. _Mastic_; G. _Mastix_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Pistacia Lentiscus_ L., the lentisk, is a diœcious\r\nevergreen, mostly found as a shrub a few feet high; but when allowed\r\nto attain its full growth, it slowly acquires the dimensions of a\r\nsmall tree having a dense head of foliage. It is a native of the\r\nMediterranean shores from Syria to Spain, and is found in Portugal,\r\nMorocco and the Canaries. In some parts of Italy it is largely cut for\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\nMastich is collected in the northern part of the island of Scio, which\r\nwas long regarded as the only region in the world capable of affording\r\nit. Experiments made in 1856 by Orphanides[651] have proved that\r\nexcellent mastich might be easily obtained in other islands of the\r\nArchipelago, and probably also in Continental Greece. The same botanist\r\nremarks that the trees yielding mastich in Scio are exclusively _male_.\r\n\r\n=History=—Mastich has been known from a very remote period, and is\r\nmentioned by Theophrastus,[652] who lived in the 4th century before the\r\nChristian era. Both Dioscorides and Pliny notice it as a production of\r\nthe island of Chio, the modern Scio.\r\n\r\nAvicenna[653] described (about the year 1000) two sorts of mastich,\r\nthe white or Roman (i.e. _Mediterranean_ or _Christian_), and the dark\r\nor Nabathæan,—the latter probably one of the Eastern forms of the drug\r\nmentioned at p. 165.\r\n\r\nBenjamin of Tudela,[654] who visited the island of Scio when travelling\r\nto the East about A.D. 1160-1173, also refers to it yielding mastich,\r\nwhich in fact has always been one of its most important productions,\r\nand from the earliest times intimately connected with its history.\r\n\r\nMastich was prescribed in the 13th century by the Welsh “Meddygon\r\nMyddvai” as an ingredient of ointments.\r\n\r\n[650] The amount of this is very small. On macerating crushed raisins\r\nin proof spirit in the proportion of 2 oz. to a pint, we found each\r\nfluid ounce of the tincture so obtained to afford by evaporation to\r\ndryness 28 grains of a dark viscid sugary extract.\r\n\r\n[651] Heldreich, _Nutzpflanzen Griechenlands_, Athen, 1862. 61.\r\n\r\n[652] _Hist.

(Bohn’s series).\r\n\r\nIn the middle ages the mastich of Scio was held as a monopoly by the\r\nGreek emperors, one of whom, Michael Paleologus in 1261, permitted the\r\nGenoese to settle in the island. His successor Andronicus II. conceded\r\nin 1304 the administration of the island to Benedetto Zaccaria, a\r\nrich patrician of Genoa and the proprietor of the alum works of Fokia\r\n(the ancient Phocæa), north-west of Smyrna, for ten years, renouncing\r\nall tribute during that period. The concession was very lucrative, a\r\nlarge revenue being derived from the _Contrata del Mastico_ or Mastich\r\ndistrict: and the Zaccaria family, taking advantage of the weakness of\r\nthe emperor, determined to hold it as long as possible. In fact they\r\nmade themselves the real sovereigns of Scio and of some of the adjacent\r\nislands, and retained their position until expelled by Andronicus III.\r\nin 1329.[655]\r\n\r\nThe island was retaken by the Genoese under Simone Vignosi in 1346;\r\nand then by a remarkable series of events became the property of\r\nan association called the _Maona_ (the Arabic word for subsidy or\r\nreinforcement). Many of the noblest families of Genoa enrolled\r\nthemselves in this corporation and settled in the island of Scio;\r\nand in order to express the community of interest that governed\r\ntheir proceedings, some of them relinquished their family names and\r\nassumed the general name of _Giustiniani_.[656] This extraordinary\r\nsociety played a part exactly comparable to that of the late East\r\nIndia Company. In Genoa it had its “_Officium Chii_”; it had its own\r\nconstitution and mint, and it engaged in wars with the emperors of\r\nConstantinople, the Venetians and the Turks, who in turn attacked and\r\nravaged the mastich island and adjacent possessions.\r\n\r\nThe Giustinianis regulated very strictly the culture of the lentisk\r\nand the gathering and export of its produce, and cruelly punished all\r\noffenders. The annual export of the drug was 300 to 400 quintals,[657]\r\nwhich were immediately assigned to the four regions with which\r\nthe Maona chiefly traded. These were _Romania_ (_i.e._ Greece,\r\nConstantinople and the Crimea), _Occidente_ (Italy, France, Spain and\r\nGermany), _Vera Turchia_ (Asia Minor), and _Oriente_ (Syria, Egypt, and\r\nNorthern Africa). In 1364, a quintal was sold for 40 _lire_; in 1417,\r\nthe price was fixed at 25 _lire_. In the 16th century, the whole income\r\nfrom the drug was 30,000 ducats (£13,750),[658] a large sum for that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIn 1566, the Giustinianis definitively lost their beautiful island, the\r\nTurks under Piali Pasha taking it by force of arms under pretext that\r\nthe customary tribute was not duly paid.[659] A few years before that\r\nevent, it was visited by the French naturalist Belon[660] who testifies\r\nfrom personal observation to the great care with which the lentisk was\r\ncultivated by the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[655] Friar Jordanus who visited Scio _circa_ 1330 (?) noticed the\r\nproduction of mastich, and also the loss of the island by Martino\r\nZaccaria.—_Mirabilia descripta, or Wonders of the East_, edited by Col.\r\nYule for the Hakluyt Society, 1863.\r\n\r\n[656] Probably partly for the reason that a Palazzo Giustiniani in\r\nGenoa had become the property of the Society. In the little “Piazza\r\nGiustiniani,” near the cathedral of San Lorenzo, that palace may still\r\nbe seen, but there is only a large view of the island of Scio which\r\nwould remind of the Maona. I was told in 1874 by Sig. Canale, the\r\nhistorian of Genoa, that he thought it doubtful that the _Officium\r\nChii_ had resided in the said palace.—F. A. F..\r\n\r\n[657] An incidental notice showing the value of the trade occurs in the\r\nletter of Columbus (himself a Genoese) announcing the result of his\r\nfirst voyage to the Indies. In stating what may be obtained from the\r\nisland of Hispaniola, he mentions—gold and spices ... and _mastich_,\r\nhitherto found only in Greece in the island of Scio, and which the\r\nSignoria sells at its own price, as much as their Highnesses (Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella) shall command to be shipped.

At that time the mastich villages, about twenty in\r\nnumber, were required to pay 286 chests of mastich annually to the\r\nTurkish officers appointed to receive the revenue.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the present century, when Olivier[662] paid a visit\r\nto the island of Chios, he found 50,000 ocche (one occa = 2·82 lb.\r\navdp. = 1·28 kilogrammes) or somewhat more to be the annual harvest of\r\nmastich.\r\n\r\nThe month of January, 1850, was memorable throughout Greece and the\r\nArchipelago for a frost of unparalleled severity which proved very\r\ndestructive to the mastich trees of Scio, and occasioned a scarcity of\r\nthe drug that lasted for many years.[663]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing statements show that for centuries past Scio or Chios\r\nwas famed for this resin; there are however a few evidences proving\r\nthat at least a little mastich used also to be collected in other\r\nislands. Amari[664] quoted an Arabic geographer of the 12th century\r\nspeaking of “_il mastice di Pantellaria cavato da’ lentischi e lo\r\nstorace odorifero_.” Pantellaria, Kossura of the ancients, is the\r\nsmall volcanic island south-west of Sicily, not far from Tunis. In\r\na list enumerating the drugs to be met with in 1582 in the fair of\r\nFrankfurt[665] we find even mastich of _Cyprus_ quoted as superior to\r\nthe common. Cyprian mastich again occurs in the pharmaceutical tariffs\r\nof 1612 and 1669 of the same city, and in many others of that time.[666]\r\n\r\nThe disuse into which mastich has fallen makes it difficult to\r\nunderstand its ancient importance; but a glance at the pharmacopœias of\r\nthe 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries shows that it was an ingredient of a\r\nlarge number of compound medicines.[667]\r\n\r\n=Secretion=—In the bark of the stems and branches of the mastich shrub,\r\nthere are resin-ducts like those in the aromatic roots of _Umbelliferæ_\r\nor _Compositæ_. In _Pistacia_ they may even be shown in the petioles.\r\nThe wood is devoid of resin,[668] so that slight incisions are\r\nsufficient to provoke the resinous exudation, the bark being not very\r\nthick, and liable to scale off.\r\n\r\n[661] _Voyage into the Levant_, i. (1718) 285.\r\n\r\n[662] _Voyage dans l’Empire Othoman et la Perse_, ii. (Paris, 1801)\r\n132-136.\r\n\r\n[663] At Athens the mercury was for a short time at -10° C. (14° F.)\r\nIn Scio, where the frost was probably quite as severe, though we have\r\nno exact data, the mischief to the lentisks varied with the locality,\r\ntrees exposed to the north or growing at considerable elevations, being\r\nkilled down to the base of the trunk, while those in more favoured\r\npositions suffered destruction only in some of their branches.\r\n\r\n[664] _Storia dei Musulmani di Sicilia_, iii. (1872) 787.\r\n\r\n[665] Flückiger, _Documente zur Geschichte der Pharmacie_, Halle, 1876.\r\n31.\r\n\r\n[666] _Ibid._ 41. 65.\r\n\r\n[667] Thus in the _London Pharmacopœia_ of 1632, mastich enters into 24\r\nof the 37 different kinds of pill, besides which it is prescribed in\r\ntroches and ointments.\r\n\r\n[668] See Unger and Kotsehy, _Die Insel Cypern_, Wien, 1865. 424.\r\n\r\n=Collection=—In Scio incisions are made about the middle of June in the\r\nbark of the stems and principal branches. From these incisions which\r\nare vertical and very close together, the resin speedily flows, and\r\nsoon hardens and dries. After 15 to 20 days it is collected with much\r\ncare in little baskets lined with white paper or clean cotton wool. The\r\nground below the trees is kept hard and clean, and flat pieces of stone\r\nare often laid on it that the droppings of resin may be saved uninjured\r\nby dirt. There is also some spontaneous exudation from the small\r\nbranches which is of very fine quality. The operations are carried on\r\nby women and children and last for a couple of months. A fine tree may\r\nyield as much as 8 to 10 pounds of mastich.\r\n\r\nThe dealers in Scio distinguish three or four qualities of the drug,\r\nof which the two finer are called κυλιστὸ and ϕλισκάρι, that collected\r\nfrom the ground πῆττα, and the worst of all ϕλοῦδα.[669]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The best sort of mastich consists of roundish tears\r\nabout the size of small peas, together with pieces of an oblong or\r\npear-shaped form. They are of a pale yellow or slightly greenish\r\ntint darkening by age, dusty and slightly opaque on the surface but\r\nperfectly transparent within. The mastich of late imported has been\r\nwashed; the tears are no longer dusty, but have a glassy transparent\r\nappearance. Mastich is brittle, has a conchoidal fracture, a slight\r\nterebinthinous balsamic odour. It speedily softens in the mouth, and\r\nmay be easily masticated and kneaded between the teeth, in this respect\r\ndiffering from sandarac, a tear of which breaks to powder when bitten.\r\n\r\nInferior mastich is less transparent, and consists of masses of larger\r\nsize and less regular shape, often contaminated with earthy and\r\nvegetable impurities.\r\n\r\nThe sp. gr. of selected tears of mastich is about 1·06. They soften at\r\n99° C. but do not melt below 108°.\r\n\r\nMastich dissolves in half its weight of pure warm acetone and then\r\ndeviates the ray of polarized light to the right. On cooling, the\r\nsolution becomes turbid. It dissolves slowly in 5 parts of oil of\r\ncloves, forming even in the cold a clear solution; it is but little\r\nsoluble in glacial acetic acid or in benzol.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Mastich is soluble to the extent of about 90 per\r\ncent in cold alcohol; the residue, which has been termed _Masticin_ or\r\n_Beta-resin of Mastich_, is a translucent, colourless, tough substance,\r\ninsoluble in boiling alcohol or in solution of caustic alkali, but\r\ndissolving in ether or oil of turpentine. According to Johnston, it is\r\nsomewhat less rich in oxygen than the following.\r\n\r\nThe soluble portion of mastich, called _Alpha-resin of Mastich_,\r\npossesses acid properties, and like many other resins has the formula\r\nC₂₀H₃₂O₃. Hartsen[670] asserts that it can be obtained in crystals. Its\r\nalcoholic solution is precipitated by an alcoholic solution of neutral\r\nacetate of lead. Mastich contains a very little volatile oil.\r\n\r\n[669] Heldreich (and Orphanides) _Nutzpflanzen Griechenlands_, Athen,\r\n1862, 60.\r\n\r\n[670] _Berichte der deutschen chem. Gesellsch._ 1876. 316.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Mastich still forms the principal revenue of Scio, from\r\nwhich island the export in 1871 was 28,000 lb. of _picked_, and\r\n42,000 lb. of _common_. The market price of picked mastich was equal\r\nto 6_s_. 10_d_. per lb.—that of common 2_s_. 10_d_. The superior\r\nquality is sent to Turkey, especially Constantinople, also to Trieste,\r\nVienna, and Marseilles, and a small quantity to England. The common\r\nsort is employed in the East in the manufacture of _raki_ and other\r\ncordials.[671]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Mastich is not now regarded as possessing any important\r\ntherapeutic virtues, and as a medicine is becoming obsolete. Even in\r\nvarnish making it is no longer employed as formerly, its place being\r\nwell supplied by less costly resins, such for example as dammar.\r\n\r\n=Varieties=—There is found in the Indian bazaars a kind of mastich\r\nwhich though called _Mustagi-rúmí_ (Roman mastich), is not imported\r\nfrom Europe but from Kabul, and is the produce of _Pistacia Khinjuk_\r\nStocks, and the so-called _P. cabulica_ St. trees growing all over\r\nSind, Belúchistan and Kabul.[672] This drug, of which the better\r\nqualities closely approximate to the mastich of Scio, sometimes appears\r\nin the European market under the name of _East Indian_ or _Bombay\r\nMastich_.

Terebinthus_ L., known as\r\n_P. atlantica_ Desf., is collected and used as mastich by the Arab\r\ntribes of Northern Africa.[673]\r\n\r\n\r\nTEREBINTHINA CHIA\r\n\r\n_Terebinthina Cypria_; _Chian or Cyprian Turpentine_; F. _Térébenthine\r\nou Baume de Chio ou de Chypres_; G. _Chios Terpenthin_, _Cyprischer\r\nTerpenthin_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Pistacia Terebinthus_ L. (P. _atlantica_ Desf.,\r\n_P. palæstina_ Boiss., _P. cabulica_ Stocks), a tree 20 to 40 feet or\r\nmore in height, in some countries only a shrub, common on the islands\r\nand shores of the Mediterranean as well as throughout Asia Minor,\r\nextending, as _P. palæstina_, to Syria and Palestine; and eastward,\r\nas _P. cabulica_, to Belúchistan and Afghanistan. It is found under\r\nthe form called _P. atlantica_ in Northern Africa, where it grows to a\r\nlarge size, and in the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\nThese several forms are mostly regarded as so many distinct species;\r\nbut after due consideration and the examination of a large number of\r\nspecimens both dried and living, we have arrived at the conclusion that\r\nthey may fairly be united under a single specific name. The extreme\r\nvarieties certainly present great differences of habit, as anyone would\r\nobserve who had compared _Pistacia Terebinthus_ as the straggling bush\r\nwhich it is in Languedoc and Provence, with the noble umbrageous tree\r\nit forms in the neighbourhood of Smyrna. But the different types are\r\nunited by so many connecting links, that we have felt warranted in\r\ndissenting from the opinion usually held respecting them.\r\n\r\nOn the branches of Pistacia Terebinthus, a kind of galls is produced,\r\nwhich we shall briefly notice in our article Gallæe halepenses.\r\n\r\n[671] Consul Cumberbatch, _Report on Trade of Smyrna_ for 1871.—_Raki_,\r\nderived from the Turkish word _sâqiz_, for mastich, which, strange to\r\nsay, would appear to have its home on the Baltic.

(1850) 458; Armieux, _Topographie\r\nmédicale du Sahara_, Paris, 1866. 58.\r\n\r\n=History=—The terebinth was well known to the ancients; it is the\r\nτέρμινθος of Theophrastus, τερέβινθος of other authors, and the _Alah_\r\nof the Old Testament.[674] Among its products, the kernels were\r\nregarded by Dioscorides as unwholesome, though agreeable in taste. By\r\npressing them, the original _Oil of Turpentine_, τερεβίνθινον ἔλαιον,\r\na mixture of essential and fat oil was obtained, as it is in the East\r\nto the present day. The resinous juice of the stem and branches, the\r\ntrue, primitive turpentine, ῤητίνη τερμινθίνη, was celebrated as the\r\nfinest of all analogous products, and preferred both to mastich and the\r\npinic resins. To the latter however the name of turpentine was finally\r\napplied.[675]\r\n\r\n=Collection=—The resinous juice is secreted in the bark, according to\r\nUnger,[676] and Marchand,[677] in special cells precisely as mastich in\r\n_P. Lentiscus_. That found in commerce is collected in the island of\r\nScio. To some extent it exudes spontaneously, yet in greater abundance\r\nafter incisions made in the stems and branches. This is done in spring,\r\nand the resin continues to flow during the whole summer; but the\r\nquantity is so small that not more that 10 or 11 ounces are obtained\r\nfrom a large tree in the course of a year. The turpentine, hardened\r\nby the coolness of the night, is scraped from the stem down which it\r\nhas flowed, or from flat stones placed at the foot of the tree to\r\nreceive it. As it is, when thus collected, always mixed with foreign\r\nsubstances, it is purified to some extent by straining through small\r\nbaskets, after having been liquefied by exposure to the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen Tournefort[678] visited Scio in 1701, the island was said to\r\nproduce scarcely 300 okes or ocche (one occa = 2·82 lb. avdp.); a\r\ncentury later Olivier[679] stated, that the turpentine was becoming\r\nvery scarce, 200 ocche only, or even less, being the annual yield. It\r\nwas then carefully collected by means of little earthen vessels tied to\r\nthe incised stems. The trade is asserted to be now almost exclusively\r\nin the hands of the Jews, who dispose of the drug in the interior part\r\nof the Turkish Empire.[680]\r\n\r\n=Description=—A specimen collected by Maltass near Smyrna in 1858 was,\r\nafter ten years, of a light yellowish colour, scarcely fluid though\r\nperfectly transparent, nearly of the odour of melted colophony or\r\nmastich, and without much taste. We found it readily soluble in spirit\r\nof wine, amylic alcohol, glacial acetic acid, benzol, or acetone, the\r\nsolution in each case being very slightly fluorescent. The alcoholic\r\nsolution reddens litmus, and is neither bitter nor acrid. Two parts of\r\nthis genuine turpentine dissolved in one of acetone deviate a ray of\r\npolarized light 7° to the right[681] in a column 50 mm. long.\r\n\r\n[674] Genesis xii. 6, where the word is rendered in our version _plain_.\r\n\r\n[675] Further historical information on the Terebinth may be found in\r\nHehn’s _Kulturpflanzen und Hausthiere_, Berlin, 1877. 336.\r\n\r\n[676] Unger u.

If pressed while\r\nwarm between two slips of glass, it is seen to be transparent, of a\r\nyellowish-brown, and much contaminated by various impurities in a state\r\nof fine division. It has an agreeable, mild terebinthinous odour and\r\nvery little taste. The whitish powder with which old Chian turpentine\r\nbecomes covered, shows no trace of crystalline structure when examined\r\nunder the microscope.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Chian turpentine consists of resin and essential\r\noil. The former is probably identical with the _Alpha-resin_ of\r\nmastich. The _Beta-resin_ or _Masticin_ appears to be absent, for we\r\nfind that Chian turpentine deprived of its essential oil by a gentle\r\nheat, dissolves entirely (impurities excepted) in alcohol sp. gr.\r\n0·815, which is by no means the case with mastich.\r\n\r\nThe essential oil which we obtained by distilling with water 64 ounces\r\nof Chian turpentine of authentic origin, amounted to nearly 14½ per\r\ncent. It has the odour of the drug; sp. gr. 0·869; boiling point 161°\r\nC.; it deviates the ray of polarized light 12·1° to the right. In\r\ncommon with turpentine oils of the _Coniferæ_, it contains a small\r\namount of an oxygenated oil, and is therefore vividly attacked by\r\nsodium. When this reaction is over and the oil is again distilled,\r\nit boils at 157° C. and has a sp. gr. of 0·862. It has now a more\r\nagreeable odour, resembling a mixture of cajuput, mace, and camphor,\r\nand nearly the same rotatory power (11·5° to the right). By saturation\r\nwith dry hydrochloric acid, it yields a solid compound after some\r\nweeks. After treatment with sodium and rectification, the oil was\r\nfound[682] to consist of C 88·75, H 11·40 per cent., which is the\r\ncomposition of oil of turpentine.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Chian Turpentine appears to have exactly the properties of the\r\npinic turpentines; in British medicine it is almost obsolete. In Greece\r\nit is sometimes added to wine or used to flavour cordials, in the same\r\nmanner as turpentine of the pine, or mastich.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALLÆ CHINENSES SEU JAPONICÆ.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—The plant which bears this important kind of gall,\r\nis _Rhus semialata_ Murray (_Rh. Bucki-amela_ Roxb.), a tree attaining\r\n30 to 40 feet, common in Northern India, China and Japan, ascending in\r\nthe outer Himalaya and the Kasia hills to elevations of 2,500 to 6,000\r\nfeet.[683]\r\n\r\n=History=—In China these galls are probably known and used both\r\nmedicinally and in dyeing since very long; they are mentioned in the\r\nherbal Puntsaou, written in the middle of the 16th century. They also\r\noccur in Cleyer’s “Specimen medicinæ sinicæ,” Frankfort, 1682, No.\r\n225, under the name _u poi çu_.[684] Kämpfer[685] also mentions a tree\r\n“Baibokf, vulgo Fusi,” growing on the hills, the pinnate leaves of\r\nwhich he found often provided with an excrescence: “Ἐπίϕνσι foliorum\r\ninformi, tuberosa, multiplici, tenui, dura, cava, Gallæ nostratis usu\r\npraestante.” No doubt this refers to the galls under notice; they began\r\nto be imported into Europe about 1724, and are noticed by Geoffroy[686]\r\nas _Oreilles des Indes_, but they seem to have soon disappeared from\r\nthe market. Pereira directed attention to them in 1844, since which\r\ntime they have formed a regular and abundant article of import both\r\nfrom China and Japan.\r\n\r\n[682] From analysis performed in my laboratory by Dr. Kraushaar.—F.

We have no account by any competent observer of their\r\ngrowth; and as to their development, we can only imagine it from the\r\nanalogous productions seen in Europe. According to Doubleday, it\r\nis probable that the female aphis punctures the upper surface of a\r\nleaf (more probably _leafstalk_), the result of the wound being the\r\ngrowth of a hollow expansion in the vegetable tissue. Of this cavity\r\nthe creature takes possession and brings forth a progeny which lives\r\nby puncturing the inner surface of their home, thus much increasing\r\nthe tendency to a morbid expansion of the soft growing tissue in an\r\noutward direction. Meanwhile the neck of the sac-like gall thickens,\r\nthe aperture contracts and finally closes, imprisoning all the inmates.\r\nHere they live and multiply until, as in the case of the pistacia\r\ngall of Europe, the sac ruptures and allows of their escape. This, we\r\nmay imagine, takes place at the period when, after some generations\r\nall wingless and perhaps all female (for the female aphis produces\r\nfor several generations without impregnation), a winged generation is\r\nbrought forth of both sexes. These may then fly to other spots, and\r\ndeposit eggs for a further propagation of their race.\r\n\r\nThe galls are collected when their green colour is changing into\r\nyellow; they are then scalded.[689]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The galls are light and hollow, varying in length from\r\n1 to 2½ inches, and of extremely diverse and irregular form. The\r\nsimplest are somewhat egg-shaped, the smaller end being attached to the\r\nleafstalk; but the form is rarely so regular, and more often the body\r\nof the gall is distorted by numerous knobby or horn-like protuberances\r\nor branches; or the gall consists of several lobes uniting in their\r\nlower part and gradually attenuated to the point by which the\r\nexcrescence is attached to the leaf.[690] But though the form is thus\r\nvariable, the structure of these bodi4s is very characteristic. They\r\nare striated towards the base, and completely covered on other parts\r\nwith a thick, velvety, grey down, which rubbed off on the prominences,\r\ndisplays the reddish-brown colour of the shell itself. The latter is\r\n⅒ to ¹/₂₀ of an inch in thickness, translucent and horny, but brittle\r\nwith a smooth and shining fracture. It is rather smoother on the inner\r\nsurface and of lighter colour than on the outer.\r\n\r\n[687] _Pharm. Journ._ vii. (1848) 310.\r\n\r\n[688] _Ibid._ x. (1851) 128.\r\n\r\n[689] Stanisl. Julien et P. Champion, _Industries anc. et modernes de\r\nl’Empire chinois_, 1869. 95.\r\n\r\n[690] We have once met with galls imported from Shanghai which\r\ndiffered from ordinary Chinese galls in not being horned, but all of\r\nan elongated ovoid form, often pointed at the upper end, and having\r\nmoreover a strong _cheesy_ smell. They may be derived from _Distylium\r\nracemosum_ S. et Z., though they do not perfectly accord with the\r\ndepressed pear-shaped forms figured by Siebold and Zuccarini (_Flora\r\nJaponica_, tab. 94).\r\n\r\nThe galls when broken are generally found to contain a white,\r\ndowny-looking substance, together with the minute, dried-up bodies of\r\nthe killed insect.[691]\r\n\r\nThe drug as imported from Japan is usually a little smaller and paler;\r\nit mostly fetches a better price in the market.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The tissue of the galls is made up of\r\nthin-walled, large cells irregularly traversed by small vascular\r\nbundles and laticiferous vessels. The latter are mostly not branched.\r\nThe parenchyme is loaded with lumps of tannic matter and starch, the\r\nlatter having mostly lost by the treatment with boiling water its\r\ngranular appearance. The epidermis of the galls is covered with little\r\ntapering hairs, consisting each of 1-5 cells, to which is due the\r\nvelvety down of the drug.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Chinese or Japanese galls contain about 70\r\nper cent. of a tannic acid, which has been first shown by Stein in\r\n1849 to be identical with that derived from oak galls (see Gallæ\r\nhalepenses), the so-called _gallo-tannic_ or common tannic acid.[692]\r\nIt is remarkable that this substance, which is by no means widely\r\ndistributed, is also present in _Rhus coriaria_, a species indigenous\r\nin the Mediterranean region. Its leaves and shoots are the well-known\r\ndyeing and tanning material _Sumach_.\r\n\r\nStein, however, pointed out at the same time, that in Chinese galls\r\ngallo-tannic acid is accompanied by a small amount, about 4 per cent.,\r\nof a different tannic matter.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—At present the supplies arrive chiefly from Hankow, from\r\nwhich great trading city the export, in 1872, was no less than 30,949\r\npeculs, equal to 36,844 cwt; 21,611 peculs, value 136,214 taels (one\r\ntael about 6_s._) in 1874. In 1877 all China exported not more than\r\n17,515 peculs. A little is also shipped from Canton and Ningpo.[693]\r\nThe quantity imported from China into the United Kingdom in 1872 was\r\n8621 cwts., valued at £20,098. In the China trade returns, the drug\r\nis always miscalled “Nut galls,” or “gallnuts.” Only those called\r\n“Wu-pei-tze” are the galls under examination. There are also oak galls\r\nexported from China resembling those from Western Asia. Japanese galls,\r\n“Kifushi,” are shipped in increasing quantities at Hiogo.[694]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The galls under notice are employed, chiefly in Germany, for the\r\nmanufacture of tannic acid, gallic acid, and pyrogallol.\r\n\r\n[691] See also Schenk, in Buchner’s _Repertorium für Pharm._ v.

In\r\ncontinental Europe it is plentiful in the valley of the Rhine up to the\r\nSwiss frontier, in Southern Germany and in Silesia, but does not ascend\r\nthe Alps, and is absent from many parts of Central and Eastern Europe,\r\nPolonia for instance. According to Ledebour, it is found in Central\r\nand Southern Russia and on the eastern side of the Ural Mountains. In\r\nSouthern Europe its place is supplied by other species.\r\n\r\n=History=—From the fact that this plant is chiefly a native of Western,\r\nNorthern and Central Europe, it is improbable that the classical\r\nauthors were acquainted with it; and for the same reason the remarks\r\nof the early Italian writers may not always apply to the species under\r\nnotice. With this reservation, we may state that broom under the name\r\n_Genista_, _Genesta_, or _Genestra_ is mentioned in the earliest\r\nprinted herbals, as that of Passau,[695] 1485, the _Hortus Sanitatis_,\r\n1491, the _Great Herbal_ printed at Southwark in 1526, and others.\r\nIt is likewise the Genista as figured and described by the German\r\nbotanists and pharmacologists of the 16th century, like Brunfels,\r\nFuchs, Tragus, Valerius Cordus (“Genista angulosa”) and others. Broom\r\nwas used in ancient Anglo-Saxon medicine[696] as well as in the Welsh\r\n“Meddygon Myddvai.” It had a place in the London Pharmacopœia of 1618,\r\nand has been included in nearly every subsequent edition. Hieronymus\r\nBrunschwyg gives[697] directions for distilling a water from the\r\nflowers, “_flores genestæ_”—a medicine which Gerarde relates was used\r\nby King Henry VIII. “against surfets and diseases thereof arising.”\r\n\r\nBroom was the emblem of those of the Norman sovereigns of England\r\ndescended from Geoffrey the “Handsome,” or “_Plantagenet_” count of\r\nAnjou (_obiit_ A.D. 1150), who was in the habit of wearing the common\r\nbroom of his country, the “_planta genista_,” in his helmet.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The Common Broom has numerous straight ascending wiry\r\nbranches, sharply 5-angled and devoid of spines. The leaves, of which\r\nthe largest are barely an inch long, consist of 3 obovate leaflets on\r\na petiole of their own length. Towards the extremities of the twigs,\r\nthe leaves are much scattered and generally reduced to a single ovate\r\nleaflet, nearly sessile. The leaves when young are clothed on both\r\nsides with long reddish hairs; these under the microscope are seen each\r\nto consist of a simple cylindrical thin-walled cell, the surface of\r\nwhich is beset with numerous extremely small protuberances.\r\n\r\n[695] _Herbarius, Patavie_ 1485.\r\n\r\n[696] Cockayne _Leechdoms_, &c., iii. (1866) 316.\r\n\r\n[697] _De arte distillandi_, first edition 1500, Argentorati, cap. xv.\r\n\r\nThe large, bright yellow, odorous flowers, which become brown in\r\ndrying, are mostly solitary in the axils of the leaves; they have a\r\npersistent campanulate calyx divided into two lips minutely toothed,\r\nand a long subulate style, curved round on itself. The legume is oblong\r\ncompressed, 1½ to 2 inches long by about ½ an inch wide, fringed with\r\nhairs along the edge. It contains 10 to 12 olive-coloured albuminous\r\nseeds, the funicle of which is expanded into a large fleshy strophiole.\r\nThey have a bitterish taste, and are devoid of starch.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the plant used in pharmacy is the younger herbaceous\r\nbranches, which are required both fresh and dried. In the former state\r\nthey emit when bruised a peculiar odour which is lost in drying. They\r\nhave a nauseous bitter taste.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Stenhouse[698] discovered in broom tops two\r\ninteresting principles, _Scoparin_, C₂₁H₂₂O₁₀, an indifferent or\r\nsomewhat acid body, and the alkaloid _Sparteine_, C₁₅H₂₆N₂, the first\r\nsoluble in water or spirit and crystallizing in yellowish tufts, the\r\nsecond a colourless oily liquid heavier than water and sparingly\r\nsoluble in it, boiling at 288° C.\r\n\r\nTo obtain scoparin, a watery decoction of the plant is concentrated so\r\nas to form a jelly after standing for a day or two. This is then washed\r\nwith a small quantity of cold water, dissolved in hot water and again\r\nallowed to repose. By repeating this treatment with the addition of a\r\nlittle hydrochloric acid, the chlorophyll may at length be separated\r\nand the scoparin obtained as a gelatinous mass, which dries as an\r\namorphous, brittle, pale yellow, neutral substance, devoid of taste and\r\nsmell. Its solution in hot alcohol deposits it partly in crystals and\r\npartly as jelly, which after drying are alike in composition. Hlasiwetz\r\nshowed (1866) that scoparin when melted with potash is resolved, like\r\nkino or quercetin, into _Phloroglucin_, C₆H₆O₃, and _Protocatechuic\r\nAcid_, 2 C₇H₆O₄.\r\n\r\nThe acid mother-liquors from which scoparin has been obtained when\r\nconcentrated and distilled with soda, yield besides ammonia a very\r\nbitter oily liquid, _Sparteine_. To obtain it pure, it requires to be\r\nrepeatedly rectified, dried by chloride of calcium, and distilled in a\r\ncurrent of dry carbonic acid. It is colourless, but becomes brown by\r\nexposure to light; it has at first an odour of aniline, but this is\r\naltered by rectification. Sparteine has a decidedly alkaline reaction\r\nand readily neutralises acids, forming crystallizable salts which are\r\nextremely bitter. Conine, nicotine, and sparteine are the only volatile\r\nalkaloids devoid of oxygen hitherto known to exist in the vegetable\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nMills[699] extracted sparteine simply by acidulated water which he\r\nconcentrated and then distilled with soda. The distillate was then\r\nsaturated with hydrochloric acid, evaporated to dryness, and submitted\r\nto distillation with potash. The oily sparteine thus obtained was dried\r\nby prolonged heating with sodium in a current of hydrogen, and finally\r\nrectified _per se_. Mills succeeded in replacing one or two equivalents\r\nof the hydrogen of sparteine by one or two of C₂H₅ (ethyl). From 150\r\nlb. the (dried?) plant, he obtained 22 cubic centimetres of sparteine,\r\nwhich we may estimate as equivalent to about ½ per mille.\r\n\r\n[698] _Phil.

(1862) l.; Gmelin’s _Chem._ xvi.\r\n(1864) 282.\r\n\r\nStenhouse ascertained that the amount of sparteine and scoparin depends\r\nmuch on external conditions, broom grown in the shade yielding less\r\nthan that produced in open sunny places. He states that shepherds are\r\nwell aware of the shrub possessing narcotic properties, from having\r\nobserved their sheep to become stupified and excited when occasionally\r\ncompelled to eat it.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Reinsch (1846) tend to show that broom contains\r\na bitter crystallizible principle in addition to the foregoing. The\r\nseeds of the allied _Cytisus Laburnum L._ afford two highly poisonous\r\nalkaloids, _Cytisine_ and _Laburnine_, discovered by A. Husemann and\r\nMarmé in 1865.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—A decoction of broom tops, made from the dried herb, is used as\r\na diuretic and purgative. The juice of the fresh plant, preserved by\r\nthe addition of alcohol, is also administered and is regarded as a very\r\nefficient preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEN FŒNI GRÆCI.\r\n\r\n_Semen Fœnugræci; Fenugreek_; F. _Semences de Fenugrec_; G.\r\n_Bockshornsamen._\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Trigonella Fœnum græcum_ L., an erect,\r\nsub-glabrous, annual plant, 1 to 2 feet high, with solitary,\r\nsubsessile, whitish flowers; indigenous to the countries surrounding\r\nthe Mediterranean, in which it has been long cultivated, and whence it\r\nappears to have spread to India.\r\n\r\n=History=—In the old Egyptian preparation _Kyphi_, an ingredient “Sebes\r\nor Sebtu” is mentioned, which is thought by Ebers to mean fenugreek.\r\nThis plant was well known to the Roman writers on husbandry, as Porcius\r\nCato (B.C. 234-149) who calls it _Fœnum Græcum_ and directs it to be\r\nsown as fodder for oxen. It is the τῇλις of Dioscorides and other Greek\r\nwriters. Its mucilaginous seeds, “siliquæ” of the Roman peasants, were\r\nvalued as an aliment and condiment for man, and as such are still\r\nlargely consumed in the East. They were likewise supposed to possess\r\nmany medicinal virtues, and had a place in the pharmacopœias of the\r\nlast century.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of fenugreek in Central Europe was encouraged by\r\nCharlemagne (A.D. 812), and the plant was grown in English gardens in\r\nthe 16th century.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fenugreek plant has a sickle-shaped pod, 3 to 4\r\ninches long, containing 10 to 20 hard, brownish-yellow seeds, having\r\nthe smell and taste which is characteristic of peas and beans, with\r\naddition of a cumarin-or melilot-flavour.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are about ⅛ of an inch long, with a rhomboid outline, often\r\nshrivelled and distorted; they are somewhat compressed, with the hilum\r\non the sharper edge, and a deep furrow running from it and almost\r\ndividing the seed into two unequal lobes. When the seed is macerated in\r\nwarm water, its structure becomes easily visible. The testa bursts by\r\nthe swelling of the internal membrane or endopleura, which like a thick\r\ngelatinous sac encloses the cotyledons and their very large hooked\r\nradicle.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The most interesting structural peculiarity of\r\nthis seed arises from the fact that the mucilage with which it abounds\r\nis not yielded by the cells of the epidermis, but by a loose tissue\r\nclosely surrounding the embryo.[700]\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The cells of the testa contain tannin; the\r\ncotyledons a yellow colouring matter, but no sugar. The air-dried\r\nseeds give off 10 per cent. of water at 100° C., and on subsequent\r\nincineration leave 7 per cent. of ash, of which nearly a fourth is\r\nphosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nEther extracts from the pulverized seeds 6 per cent. of a fœtid, fatty\r\noil, having a bitter taste. Amylic alcohol removes in addition a small\r\nquantity of resin. Alcohol added to a concentrated aqueous extract,\r\nforms a precipitate of mucilage, amounting when dried to 28 per cent.\r\nBurnt with soda-lime, the seeds yielded to Jahns[701] 3·4 per cent. of\r\nnitrogen, equivalent to 22 per cent. of albumin. No researches have\r\nbeen yet made to determine the nature of the odorous principle.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—Fenugreek is cultivated in Morocco, in the\r\nsouth of France near Montpellier, in a few places in Switzerland, in\r\nAlsace, and in some other provinces of the German and Austrian empires,\r\nas Thuringia and Moravia. It is produced on a far larger scale in\r\nEgypt, where it is known by the Arabic name _Hulba_, and whence it is\r\nexported to Europe and India. In 1873 it was stated that the profits\r\nof the European growers were much reduced by the seed being largely\r\nexported from Mogador and Bombay.\r\n\r\nUnder the Sanscrit name of _Methi_, which has passed, slightly\r\nmodified, into several of the modern Indian languages, fenugreek is\r\nmuch grown in the plains of India during the cool season. In the year\r\n1872-73, the quantity of seed exported from Sind to Bombay was 13,646\r\ncwt., valued at £4,405.[702] From the port of Bombay there were shipped\r\nin the same year 9,655 cwt., of which only 100 cwt. are reported as for\r\nthe United Kingdom.[703]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—In Europe fenugreek as a medicine is obsolete, but the powdered\r\nseeds are still often sold by chemists for veterinary pharmacy and as\r\nan ingredient of curry powder. The chief consumption is, however, in\r\nthe so-called _Cattle Foods_.\r\n\r\nThe fresh plant in India is commonly eaten as a green vegetable, while\r\nthe seeds are extensively used by the natives in food and medicine.\r\n\r\n[700] Figured by Lanessan in his French translation of the\r\n_Pharmacographia_, i.

Gomme\r\nAdragante_; _G. Traganth_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin.=—Tragacanth is the gummy exudation from the\r\nstem of several pieces of _Astragalus_, belonging to the subgenus\r\n_Tragacantha_. The plants of this group are low perennial shrubs,\r\nremarkable for their leaves having a strong, persistent, spiny petiole.\r\nAs the leaves and shoots are very numerous and regular, many of the\r\nspecies have the singular aspect of thorny hemispherical cushions,\r\nlying close on the ground; while others, which are those furnishing the\r\ngum, grow erect with a naked woody stem, and somewhat resemble furze\r\nbushes.\r\n\r\nA few species occur in South-western Europe, others are found in Greece\r\nand Turkey; but the largest number are inhabitants of the mountainous\r\nregions of Asia Minor, Syria, Armenia, Kurdistan and Persia. The\r\ntragacanth of commerce is produced in the last named countries, and\r\nchiefly, though not exclusively, by the following species[704]:—\r\n\r\n1. _Astragalus adscendens_ Boiss. et Hausskr., a shrub attaining 4\r\nfeet in height, native, of the mountains of South-western Persia at an\r\naltitude of 9,000 to 10,000 feet. According to Haussknecht, it affords\r\nan abundance of gum.\r\n\r\n2. _A. leioclados_ Boiss.\r\n\r\n3. _A. brachycalyx_ Fisch., a shrub of 3 feet high, growing on the\r\nmountains of Persian Kurdistan, likewise affords tragacanth.\r\n\r\n4. _A. gummifer_ Labill., a small shrub of wide distribution occurring\r\non the Lebanon and Mount Hermon in Syria, the Beryt Dagh in Cataonia,\r\nthe Arjish Dagh (Mount Argæus) near Kaisariyeh in Central Asia Minor,\r\nand in Armenia and Northern Kurdistan.\r\n\r\n5. _A. microcephalus_ Willd., like the preceding a widely distributed\r\nspecies, extending from the south-west of Asia Minor to the north-east\r\ncoast, and to Turkish and Russian Armenia. A specimen of this\r\nplant with incisions in the stem, was sent some years ago to the\r\nPharmaceutical Society by Mr. Maltass of Smyrna. We received a large\r\nexample of the same species, the stem of which is marked by old\r\nincisions, from the Rev. W. A. Farnsworth of Kaisariyeh, who states\r\nthat tragacanth is collected from it on Mount Argæus.\r\n\r\n6. _A. pycnocladus_ Boiss. et Haussk., nearly related to _A.\r\nmicrocephalus_; it was discovered on the high mountains of Avroman and\r\nShahu in Persia by Professor Haussknecht, who states that it exudes\r\ntragacanth in abundance.\r\n\r\n7. _A. stromatodes_ Bunge, growing at an elevation of 5,000 feet on the\r\nAkker Dagh range, near Marash in Northern Syria.\r\n\r\n8. _A. kurdicus_ Boiss., a shrub 3 to 4 feet high, native of the\r\nmountains of Cilicia and Cappadocia, extending thence to Kurdistan.\r\nHaussknecht has informed us that from this and the last named species,\r\nthe so-called _Aintab Tragacanth_ is chiefly obtained.\r\n\r\n[704] As described in Boissier’s _Flora Orientalis_, ii. (1872). We\r\nhave to thank Professor Haussknecht of Weimar for revising our list\r\nof species, and for some valuable information as to the localities in\r\nwhich the drug is produced.\r\n\r\nProbably the drug is also to some extent collected from\r\n\r\n9. _A. verus_ Olivier, in North-western Persia and Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nLastly as to Greece, tragacanth is also afforded by\r\n\r\n10. _A. Parnassi_ Boiss., var. _cyllenea_, a small shrub found in\r\nabundance on the northern mountains of the Morea, which is stated by\r\nHeldreich[705] to be the almost exclusive source of the tragacanth\r\ncollected about Vostizza and Patras.\r\n\r\n=History=—Tragacanth has been known from a very early period.\r\nTheophrastus in the 3rd century B.C. mentioned Crete, the Peloponnesus\r\nand Media as its native countries. Dioscorides, who as a native\r\nof South-eastern Asia Minor was probably familiar with the plant,\r\ndescribes it correctly as a low spiny bush. The drug is mentioned\r\nby the Greek physicians Oribasius, Aëtius, and Paulus Ægineta (4th\r\nto 7th cent.), and by many of the Arabian writers on medicine. The\r\nabbreviated form of its name “Dragantum” already occurs in the book\r\n“Artis veterinariæ, seu mulomedicinæ” of Vegetius Renatus, who lived\r\nabout A.D. 400. During the middle ages the gum was imported into Europe\r\nthrough the trading cities of Italy, as shown in the statutes of\r\nPisa,[706] A.D. 1305, where it is mentioned as liable to impost.\r\n\r\nPierre Belon, the celebrated French naturalist and traveller, saw and\r\ndescribed, about 1550, the collecting of tragacanth in the northern\r\npart of Asia Minor; and Tournefort in 1700 observed on Mount Ida in\r\nCandia the singular manner in which the gum is exuded from the living\r\nplant.[707]\r\n\r\n=Secretion=—It has been shown by H. von Mohl[708] and by Wigand[709]\r\nthat tragacanth is produced by metamorphosis of the cell membrane, and\r\nthat it is not simply the dried juice of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe stem of a gum-bearing _Astragalus_ cut transversely, exhibits\r\nconcentric annual layers which are extremely tough and fibrous, easily\r\ntearing lengthwise into thin filaments. These inclose a central column,\r\nradiating from which are numerous medullary rays, both of very singular\r\nstructure, for instead of presenting a thin-walled parenchyme, they\r\nappear to the naked eye as a hard translucent gum-like mass, becoming\r\ngelatinous in water. Examined microscopically, this gummy substance is\r\nseen to consist not of dried mucilage, but of the very cells of the\r\npith and medullary rays, in process of transformation into tragacanth.\r\nThe transformed cells, if their transformation has not advanced too\r\nfar, exhibit the angular form and close packing of parenchyme-cells,\r\nbut their walls are much incrassated and evidently consist of numerous\r\nvery thin strata.\r\n\r\nThat these cells are but ordinary parenchyme-cells in an altered state,\r\nis proved by the pith and medullary rays of the smaller branches which\r\npresent no such unusual structure. Mohl was able to trace this change\r\nfrom the period in which the original cell membrane could be still\r\neasily distinguished from its incrusting layers, to that in which the\r\ntransformation had proceeded so far that it was impossible to perceive\r\nany defined cells, the whole substance being metamorphosed into a more\r\nor less uniform mucilaginous mass.\r\n\r\n[705] _Nutzpflanzen Griechenlands_, Athen, 1862. 71.\r\n\r\n[706] Bonaini, _Statuti inediti della città di Pissa dal xii. al xiv.\r\nsecolo_, iii.

(1861)\r\n117.\r\n\r\nThe tension under which this peculiar tissue is held in the interior\r\nof the stem is very remarkable in _Astragalus gummifer_ which one of\r\nus had the opportunity of observing on the Lebanon in 1860.[710] On\r\ncutting off a branch of the thickness of the finger, there immediately\r\nexudes from the centre a stream of soft, solid tragacanth, pushing\r\nitself out like a worm, to the length of ¾ of an inch, sometimes in the\r\ncourse of half an hour; while much smaller streams (or none at all) are\r\nemitted from the medullary rays of the thick bark.\r\n\r\n=Production=—The principal localities in Asia Minor in which tragacanth\r\nis collected are the district of Angora, the capital of the ancient\r\nGalatia; Isbarta, Buldur and Yalavatz,[711] north of the gulf of\r\nAdalia; the range of the Ali Dagh between Tarsous and Kaisariyeh, and\r\nthe mountainous country eastward as far as the valley of the Euphrates.\r\nThe drug is also gathered in Armenia on the elevated range of the\r\nBingol Dagh south of Erzerum; throughout Kurdistan from Mush for 500\r\nmiles in a south-eastern direction as far as the province of Luristan\r\nin Persia, a region including the high lands south of lake Van, and\r\nwest of lake Urumiah. It is likewise produced in Persia farther\r\neast, over an area 300 miles long by 100 to 150 miles broad, between\r\nGilpaigon and Kashan, southward to the Mahomed Senna range north-east\r\nof Shiraz, thus including the lofty Bakhtiyari mountains.\r\n\r\nAs to the way in which the gum is obtained, it appears from the\r\nstatements of Maltass, that in July and August the peasants clear away\r\nthe earth from around the stem of the shrub, and then make in the bark\r\nseveral incisions, from which during the following 3 or 4 days the gum\r\nexudes and dries in flakes. In some localities they also puncture the\r\nbark with the point of a knife. Whilst engaged in these operations,\r\nthey pick from the shrubs whatever gum they find exuded naturally.\r\n\r\nHamilton,[712] who saw the shrub in 1836 on the hills about Buldur,\r\nsays “the gum is obtained by making an incision in the stem near the\r\nroot, and cutting through the pith, when the sap exudes in a day or two\r\nand hardens.”\r\n\r\nFormerly the peasants were content to collect the naturally exuded\r\ngum, no pains being taken to make incisions, whereby alone white flaky\r\ngum is obtained. We have in fact heard an old druggist state, that he\r\nremembered the first appearance of this fine kind of tragacanth in the\r\nLondon market. According to Professor Haussknecht, whose observations\r\nrelate chiefly to Kurdistan and Persia, the tragacanth collected in\r\nthese regions is mostly a spontaneous exudation.\r\n\r\nTragacanth is brought to Smyrna, which is a principal market for it,\r\nfrom the interior, in bags containing about 2 quintals each, by native\r\ndealers who purchase it of the peasants. In this state it is a very\r\ncrude article, consisting of all the gatherings mixed together. To\r\nfit it for the European markets, some of which have their special\r\nrequirements, it has to be sorted into different qualities, as _Flaky\r\nor Leaf Gum, Vermicelli_ and _Common_ or _Sorts_; this sorting is\r\nperformed almost exclusively by Spanish Jews.\r\n\r\n[710] Hanbury, _Science Papers_, 29.\r\n\r\n[711] _Pharm. Journ._ xv. (1856) 18.\r\n\r\n[712] _Researches in Asia Minor, Pontus and Armenia_, i. (1842) 492.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The peculiar conditions under which tragacanth exudes,\r\narising from the pressure of the surrounding tissues and the power of\r\nsolidifying a large amount of water, will account to some extent for\r\nthe strange forms in which this exudation occurs.\r\n\r\nThe spontaneously exuded gum is mostly in mammiform or botryoidal\r\nmasses from the size of a pea upwards, of a dull waxy lustre, and\r\nbrownish or yellowish hue. It also occurs in vermiform pieces more or\r\nless contorted and very variable in thickness; some of them may have\r\nexuded as the result of artificial punctures. It is this form that\r\nbears the trade name of _Vermicelli_. The most valued sort is however\r\nthe _Flake Tragacanth_, which consists of thin flattish pieces or\r\nflakes, 1, 2, 3 or more inches in length, by ¼ to 1 in width.[713]\r\nThey are marked on the surface by wavy lines and bands, or by a series\r\nof concentric wave-marks, as if the soft gum had been forced out by\r\nsuccessive efforts. The pieces are contorted and altogether very\r\nvariable in form and size. The gum is valued in proportion to its\r\npurity and whiteness. The best, whether vermiform or flaky, is dull\r\nwhite, translucent, devoid of lustre, somewhat flexible and horny,\r\nfirm, and not easily broken, inodorous and with scarcely any or only a\r\nslight bitterish taste.\r\n\r\nThe tragacanth of Kurdistan and Persia shipped from Bagdad, which\r\nsometimes appears in the London drug sales under the incorrect name of\r\n_Syrian Tragacanth_, is in very fine and large pieces which are rather\r\nmore translucent and ribbon-like than the selected tragacanth imported\r\nfrom Smyrna: in fact, the two varieties when seen in bulk are easily\r\ndistinguishable.\r\n\r\nThe inferior kinds of tragacanth have more or less of colour, and are\r\ncontaminated with bark, earth and other foreign substances. They used\r\nformerly to be much imported into Europe, and were frequently mentioned\r\nduring the past centuries as _black tragacanth_.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The transformation of the cells into tragacanth\r\nis usually not so complete, that every trace of the original tissue\r\nor its contents has disappeared. In the ordinary drug, the remains\r\nof cell-walls as well as starch granules may be seen, especially if\r\nthin slices are examined under oil or any other liquid not acting on\r\nthe gum. Polarized light will then distinctly show the starch and the\r\ncell-walls. If a thin section is imbued with a solution of iodine in\r\niodide of potassium and then moistened with concentrated sulphuric\r\nacid, the cell-walls will assume a blue colour as well as the starch.\r\n\r\n[713] In the Museum of the Pharmaceutical Society in London, there is\r\nsome Flake Tragacanth remarkable for its enormous size, but in other\r\nrespects precisely like the ordinary kind. The ribbon-like strips are\r\nas much as 2 inches wide and ³/₁₀ of an inch thick, and the largest\r\nwhich is several inches long weighs 2¾ ounces. Professor Haussknecht\r\nhas informed us that he has seen in Luristan stems of _Astragalus\r\neriostylus_ Boiss. et Haussk. more than 6 feet in height and 5 inches\r\nin diameter, and bearing tragacanth. It is probable that the specimen\r\nof gum we have described was produced by some species attaining these\r\nextraordinary dimensions. Among the Kurdistan tragacanth, there occur\r\ncurious cylindrical vermiform pieces, about ⅕ of an inch in diameter,\r\ncoated with a network of woody fibre. We are told by Professor H. that\r\nthey are picked out of the centre of cut off pieces of stem, split open\r\nby rapid drying in the sun.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—When tragacanth is immersed in water it swells,\r\nand in the course of some hours disintegrates so that it can be\r\ndiffused through the liquid. So great is its power of absorbing water\r\nthat even with 50 times its weight, it forms a thick mucilage. If one\r\npart of tragacanth is shaken with 100 parts of water and the liquid\r\nfiltered, a neutral solution may be obtained which yields an abundant\r\nprecipitate with acetate of lead, and mixes clearly with a concentrated\r\nsolution of ferric chloride or of borax,—in these respects differing\r\nfrom a solution of gum arabic. On the other hand, it agrees with the\r\nlatter in that it is thrown down as a transparent jelly by alcohol,\r\nand rendered turbid by oxalate of ammonium. The residue on the filter\r\nis a slightly turbid, slimy, non-adhesive mucilage, which when dried\r\nforms a very coherent mass. It has received the name of _Bassorin_,\r\n_Traganthin_ or _Adraganthin_, and agrees with the formula C₁₂H₂₀O₁₀.\r\n\r\nTragacanth is readily soluble in alkaline liquids, even in ammonia\r\nwater and at the same time assumes a yellow colour; heated with ammonia\r\nin a sealed tube at 90° C. it blackens.\r\n\r\nThe drug loses by drying about 14 per cent. of water, which it absorbs\r\nagain on exposure to the air. Pure flake tragacanth incinerated leaves\r\n3 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Tragacanth is shipped from Constantinople, Smyrna and\r\nthe Persian Gulf. The annual export of the gum from Smyrna has been\r\nrecently stated[714] to be 4,500 quintals, value 675,000 Austrian\r\nflorins (£67,500); and the demand to be always increasing.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Though tragacanth is devoid of active properties, it is a very\r\nuseful addition to many medicines. Diffused in water it acts as a\r\ndemulcent, and is also convenient for the suspension of a heavy powder\r\nin a mixture. It is an important ingredient for imparting firmness to\r\nlozenges and pill-masses.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The fine quantities consisting of large distinct pieces\r\nare not liable to adulteration, but the small and the inferior kinds\r\nare often sophisticated. At Smyrna, tragacanth is mixed with gums\r\ntermed respectively _Mosul_ and _Caramania Gum_. The former appears\r\nto be simply very inferior tragacanth; the latter which is sometimes\r\ncalled in the London market _Hog Gum Tragacanth_ or _Bassora Gum_,[715]\r\nis said to be the exudation of almond and plum trees. It occurs in\r\nnodular masses of a waxy lustre and dull brown hue, which immersed in\r\nwater gradually swells into a voluminous white mass. To render this gum\r\navailable for adulteration, the lumps are broken into small angular\r\nfragments, the size of which is adjusted to the sort of tragacanth with\r\nwhich they are to be mixed. As the Caramania Gum is somewhat dark,\r\nit is usual to whiten it by _white lead_, previous to mixing it with\r\n_Small Leaf_ or _Flake_, or with the _Vermicelli_ gum.\r\n\r\nBy careful examination the fraud is easily detected, angular fragments\r\nnot being proper to any true tragacanth. The presence of lead may be\r\nreadily proved by shaking suspected fragments for a moment with dilute\r\nnitric acid, which will dissolve any carbonate present, and afford a\r\nsolution which may be tested by the ordinary reagents.\r\n\r\n[714] C. von Scherzer, _Smyrna_, Wien, 1873. 143.\r\n\r\n[715] It is sometimes shipped from Bussorah.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX GLYCYRRHIZÆ.\r\n\r\n_Radix Liquiritiæ_; _Liquorice Root_; F. _Réglisse_; G. _Süssholz_,\r\n_Lakritzwurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Glycyrrhiza glabra_ L., a plant which under several\r\nwell marked varieties[716] is found over an immense extent of the\r\nwarmer regions of Europe, spreading thence eastward into Central Asia.\r\nThe root used in medicine is derived from two principal Varieties,\r\nnamely:—\r\n\r\nα. _typica_—Nearly glabrous, leaves glutinous beneath, divisions of\r\nthe calyx linear-lanceolate often a little longer than the tube,\r\ncorolla purplish blue, legume glabrous, 3-6 seeded. It is indigenous to\r\nPortugal, Spain, Southern Italy, Sicily, Greece, Crimea, the Caucasian\r\nProvinces and Northern Persia; and is cultivated in England, France and\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nγ. _glandulifera_ (_G. glandulifera_ W.K.)—Stems more or less pubescent\r\nor roughly glandular, leaves often glandular beneath, legume sparsely\r\nor densely echinate-glandular, many-seeded, or short and 2-3 seeded. It\r\noccurs in Hungary, Galicia, Central and Southern Russia, Crimea, Asia\r\nMinor, Armenia, Siberia, Persia, Turkestan and Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n_G. glabra_ L. has long, stout, perennial roots, and erect, herbaceous\r\nannual stems. In var. α., the plant throws out long stolons which run\r\nhorizontally at some distance below the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\n=History=—Theophrastus[717] in commenting on the taste of different\r\nroots (3rd cent. B.C.) instances the sweet Scythian root which grows\r\nin the neighbourhood of the lake Mæotis (Sea of Azov), and is good for\r\nasthma, dry cough and all pectoral diseases,—an allusion unquestionably\r\nto liquorice. Dioscorides,[718] who calls the plant γλυκιῤρίζη, notices\r\nits glutinous leaves and purplish flowers, but as he describes the\r\npods to be in balls resembling those of the plane, and the roots to be\r\nsub-austere (ὑπόστρυϕνοι) as well as sweet, it is possible he had in\r\nview _Glycyrrhiza echinata_ L. as well as _G. glabra_.\r\n\r\nRoman writers, as Celsus and Scribonius Largus, mention liquorice as\r\n_Radix dulcis_. Pliny, who describes it as a native of Cilicia and\r\nPontus, makes no allusion to it growing in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of liquorice in Europe does not date from a very remote\r\nperiod, as we conclude from the absence of the name in early mediæval\r\nlists of plants. It is, for instance, not enumerated among the plants\r\nwhich Charlemagne ordered (A.D. 812) to be introduced from Italy into\r\nCentral Europe;[719] nor among the herbs of the convent gardens as\r\ndescribed by Walafridus Strabus,[720] abbot of Reichenau, lake of\r\nConstance, in the 9th century; nor yet in the copious list of herbs\r\ncontained in the vocabulary of Alfric, archbishop of Canterbury in the\r\n10th century.[721]\r\n\r\n[716] We accept those adopted by Boissier in his _Flora Orientalis_,\r\nii.

This work contains\r\nseveral other early lists of plants.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, liquorice is described as being cultivated in Italy\r\nby Piero de’ Crescenzi[722] of Bologna, who lived in the 13th century.\r\nThe cultivation of the plant in the north of England existed at the\r\nclose of the 16th century, but how much earlier we have not been able\r\nto trace.\r\n\r\nAs a medicine the drug was well known in Germany in the 11th century,\r\nand an extensive cultivation of the plant was carried on near Bamberg,\r\nBavaria, in the 16th century, so that in many of the numerous\r\npharmaceutical tariffs of those times in Germany not only Glycyrrhizæ\r\nsuccus creticus, seu candiacus, seu venetus is quoted, but also\r\nexpressly that of Bamberg.[723]\r\n\r\nThe word _Liquiritia_, whence is derived the English name _Liquorice_\r\n(_Lycorys_ in the 13th century), is a corruption of _Glycyrrhiza_, as\r\nshown in the transitional mediæval form _Gliquiricia_. The Italian\r\n_Regolizia_, the German _Lacrisse_ or _Lakriz_, the Welsh _Lacris_[724]\r\nand the French _Réglisse_ (anciently _Requelice_ or _Recolice_) have\r\nthe same origin.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation, and habit of growth=—The liquorice plant is cultivated in\r\nEngland at Mitcham and in Yorkshire, but not on a very extensive scale.\r\nThe plants, which require a good deep soil, well enriched by manure,\r\nare set in rows, attain a height of 4 to 5 feet and produce flowers\r\nbut not seeds. The root is dug up at the beginning of winter, when\r\nthe plant is at least 3 or 4 years old. The latter has then a crown\r\ndividing into several aerial stems. Below the crown is a principal root\r\nabout 6 inches in length, which divides into several (3 to 5) rather\r\nstraight roots, running without much branching, though beset with\r\nslender wiry rootlets, to a depth of 3, 4 or more feet.[725] Besides\r\nthese downward-running roots, the principal roots emit horizontal\r\nrunners or stolons, which grow at some distance below the surface and\r\nattain a length of many feet. These runners are furnished with leaf\r\nbuds and throw up stems in their second year.\r\n\r\nEvery portion of the subterraneous part of the plant is carefully\r\nsaved; the roots proper are washed, trimmed, and assorted, and either\r\nsold fresh in their entire state, or cut into short lengths and dried,\r\nthe cortical layer being sometimes first scraped off. The older\r\nrunners distinguished at Mitcham as “_hard_,” are sorted out and sold\r\nseparately; the young, called “_soft_,” are reserved for propagation.\r\n\r\nIn Calabria, the singular practice prevails of growing the liquorice\r\namong the wheat in the cornfields.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Fresh liquorice (English) when washed is externally of a\r\nbright yellowish-brown. It is very flexible, easily cut with a knife,\r\nexhibiting a light yellow, juicy, internal substance which consists\r\nof a thick bark surrounding a woody column. Both bark and wood are\r\nextremely tough, readily tearing into long, fibrous strips. The root\r\nhas a peculiar earthy odour, and a strong and characteristic sweet\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n[722] _Libro della Agricoltura_, Venet. 1511. lib. vi. c. 62.\r\n\r\n[723] Gesner, _Valerii Cordi Hist. stirp._ Argentorati, 1561.\r\n164.—Flückiger, _Documente zur Geschichte der Pharmacie_, Halle, 1876.\r\n39. 46.\r\n\r\n[724] In the “Meddygon Myddvai” of the 13th century, Llandovery, 1861,\r\np. 159. 355 (it is written there Licras).\r\n\r\n[725] This form of root, which reminds one of a whip with three or\r\nfour lashes and a very short handle, is probably due to the method of\r\npropagating adopted at Mitcham, where a short stick or _runner_ is\r\nplanted upright in the ground.\r\n\r\nDried liquorice root is supplied in commerce either with or without\r\nthe thin brown coat In the latter state it is known as _peeled_ or\r\n_decorticated_. The English root, of which the supply is very limited,\r\nis usually offered cut into pieces 3 or 4 inches long, and of the\r\nthickness of the little finger.\r\n\r\n_Spanish Liquorice Root_, also known as _Tortosa_ or _Alicante\r\nLiquorice_, is imported in bundles several feet in length, consisting\r\nof straight unpeeled roots and runners, varying in thickness from ¼ to\r\n1 inch. The root is tolerably smooth or somewhat transversely cracked\r\nand longitudinally wrinkled; that from Tortosa is usually of a good\r\nexternal appearance, that from Alicante sometimes untrimmed, dirty, of\r\nvery unequal size, showing frequently the knobby crowns of the root.\r\nAlicante liquorice root is sometimes shipped in bags or loose.\r\n\r\n_Russian Liquorice Root_, which is much used in England, is we presume\r\nderived from _G. glabra_ var. _glandulifera_. It is imported from\r\nHamburg in large bales, and is met with both peeled and unpeeled. The\r\npieces are 12 to 18 inches long, with a diameter of ¼ of an inch to 1\r\nor even 2 inches. Sometimes very old roots, split down the centre and\r\nforming channelled pieces as much as 3½ inches wide at the crown end,\r\nare to be met with. This liquorice in addition to being sweet has a\r\ncertain amount of bitterness.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The root exhibits well-marked structural\r\npeculiarities. The corky layer is made up of the usual tabular cells;\r\nthe primary cortical tissue of a few rows of cells. The chief portion\r\nof the bark consists of liber or endophlœum, and is built up for the\r\nmost part of parenchymatous tissue accompanied by elongated fibres of\r\ntwo kinds, partly united into true liber-bundles and partly forming a\r\nkind of network, the smaller threads of which deviate considerably from\r\nthe straight line. Solution of iodine imparts an orange hue to both\r\nkinds of bast-bundles, and well displays the structural features of the\r\nbark.\r\n\r\nThe woody column of the root exhibits three distinct forms of cell,\r\nnamely ligneous cells (libriform) with oblique ends; parenchymatous,\r\nalmost cubic cells; and large pitted vessels. In the Russian root, the\r\nsize of all the cells is much more considerable than in the Spanish.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The root of liquorice contains, in addition\r\nto sugar and albuminous matter, a peculiar sweet substance named\r\n_Glycyrrhizin_, which is precipitated from a strong decoction upon\r\naddition of an acid or solution of cream of tartar, or neutral or basic\r\nacetate of lead. When washed with dilute alcohol and dried, it is an\r\namorphous yellow powder, having a strong bitter-sweet taste and an\r\nacid reaction. It forms with hot water a solution which gelatinizes\r\non cooling, does not reduce alkaline tartrate of copper, is not\r\nfermentable, and does not rotate the plane of polarization. From the\r\nanalysis and experiments of Rösch, performed in the laboratory of\r\nGorup-Besanez at Erlangen, in 1876, the formula C₁₆H₂₄O₆ was derived\r\nfor glycyrrhizin. By boiling it with dilute hydrochloric or sulphuric\r\nacid it is resolved into a resinous amorphous bitter substance named\r\n_Glycyrretin_, and an uncrystallizable sugar having the characters of\r\nglucose. The formula of glycyrretin has not yet been settled. Weselsky\r\nand Benedikt, in 1876, showed that 65 per cent. of it may be obtained\r\nfrom glycyrrhizin. By melting glycyrretin with about 5 parts of caustic\r\npotash paraoxy-benzoïc acid is produced.\r\n\r\nAlkalis easily dissolve glycyrrhizin with a brown colour and emission\r\nof a peculiar odour. In the root it perhaps exists combined with\r\nammonia, inasmuch as the aqueous extract evolves that alkali when\r\nwarmed with potash (Roussin, 1875). According to Sestini (1878)\r\nglycyrrhizin is present in the root combined with calcium; he obtained\r\n6·3 per cent. of glycyrrhizin from the root previously dried at 110°.\r\nBy exhausting glycyrrhizin with glacial acetic acid Habermann in 1876\r\nsucceeded in isolating almost _colourless_ crystals having the sweet\r\ntaste of the root. They yield, by boiling them with dilute acids, a\r\nyellow substance which would appear to agree with glycyrretin. The deep\r\nyellow walls of the vessels and prosenchymatous cells appear to be the\r\nchief seat of the glycyrrhizin.\r\n\r\nThe sugar of liquorice root has not yet been isolated; the aqueous\r\ninfusion of the _dried_ root separates protoxide of copper from an\r\nalkaline solution of cupric tartrate. Yet the sugar as extracted from\r\nthe _fresh_ root by cold water does not precipitate alkaline cupric\r\ntartrate at all in the cold, and not abundantly even on prolonged\r\nboiling.\r\n\r\n_Asparagin_ was obtained from the root by Robiquet (1809) and by\r\nPlisson (1827). Sestini (1878) isolated 2-4 parts of asparagin from\r\n100 parts of the root dried at 110° C. Robiquet also found the root to\r\ncontain malic acid. The presence of starch in abundance is shown by the\r\nmicroscope as well as by testing a decoction of the root with iodine.\r\nThe outer bark of the root contains a small quantity of tannin.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Liquorice root is imported into Great Britain from Germany,\r\nRussia and Spain, but there are no data for showing to what extent.\r\nFrance imported in 1872 no less than 4,348,789 kilogrammes (4282 tons),\r\nwhich was more than double the quantity imported the previous year.[726]\r\n\r\nLiquorice root is much used in China, and is largely produced in some\r\nof the northern provinces. In 1870, 1,304 peculs were shipped from\r\nNingpo,[727] and 7,147 pepuls in 1877 from Cheefu (one pecul = 133·33\r\nlb. avdp.).\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Liquorice root is employed for making extract of liquorice and\r\nin some other pharmaceutical preparations. The powdered root is used to\r\nimpart stiffness to pill-masses and to prevent the adhesion of pills.\r\nLiquorice has a remarkable power of covering the flavour of nauseous\r\nmedicines. As a domestic medicine, liquorice root is far more largely\r\nused on the Continent than in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[726] _Documents statistiques réunis par l’administration des Douanes\r\nsur le commerce de la France_, année 1872, Paris, 1873.\r\n\r\n[727] _Reports on Trade at the Treaty Ports in China for_ 1870,\r\nShanghai, 1871. 13. 62.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCUS GLYCYRRHIZÆ.\r\n\r\n    _Succus Liquiritiæ_, _Extractum Glycyrrhizæ\r\n        Italicum_; _Italian Extract of Liquorice_,\r\n        _Spanish Liquorice_, _Spanish Juice_;\r\n        F. _Jus ou Suc de Réglisse_; G.\r\n        _Süssholzsaft_, _Lakriz_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Glycyrrhiza glabra_ L., see preceding article, p.\r\n179.\r\n\r\n=History=—Inspissated liquorice juice was known in the time of\r\nDioscorides, and may be traced in the writings of Oribasius and\r\nMarcellus Empiricus in the latter half of the 4th century, and in those\r\nof Paulus Ægineta in the 7th. It appears to have been in common use in\r\nEurope during the middle ages. In A.D. 1264, “_Liquorice_” is charged\r\nin the Wardrobe Accounts of Henry III.;[728] and as the article cost\r\n3_d_. per lb., or the same price as grains of paradise and one-third\r\nthat of cinnamon, we are warranted in supposing the _extract_ and not\r\nthe mere _root_ is intended. Again, in the Patent of Pontage granted by\r\nEdward I., A.D. 1305, to aid in repairing the London Bridge, permission\r\nis given to lay toll on various foreign commodities including\r\n_Liquorice_.[729] A political song written in 1436[730] makes mention\r\nof _Liquorice_ as a production of Spain, but the plant is not named as\r\nan object of cultivation by Herrera, the author of a work on Spanish\r\nagriculture in 1513.\r\n\r\nSaladinus,[731] who wrote about the middle of the 15th century,\r\nnames it among the wares kept by the Italian apothecaries; and it is\r\nenumerated in a list of drugs of the city of Frankfort written about\r\nthe year 1450.[732]\r\n\r\nDorsten,[733] in the first half of the 16th century, mentions the\r\nliquorice plant as abundant in many parts of Italy, and describes the\r\nmethod of making the _Succus_ by crushing and boiling the fresh root.\r\nMattioli[734] states that the juice made into _pastilli_ was brought\r\nevery year from Apulia, and especially from the neighbourhood of Monte\r\nGargano. Extract of liquorice was made at Bamberg in Germany, where the\r\nplant is still largely cultivated, as early as 1560.[735]\r\n\r\n=Manufacture=—This is conducted on a large scale in Spain, Southern\r\nFrance, Sicily, Calabria, Austria, Southern Russia (Astracan and\r\nKasan), Greece (Patras) and Asia Minor (Sokia and Nazli, near Smyrna);\r\nbut the extract with which England is supplied is almost exclusively\r\nthe produce of Calabria, Sicily and Spain.\r\n\r\nThe process of manufacture varies only by reason of the amount of\r\nintelligence with which it is performed, and the greater or less\r\nperfection of the apparatus employed. As witnessed by one of us (H.)\r\nat Rossano in Calabria in May, 1872, it may be thus described from\r\nnotes made at the time. The factory employs about 60 persons, male\r\nand female. The root having been taken from the ground the previous\r\nwinter, is stacked in the yard around the factory; it is mostly of the\r\nthickness of the fingers, with here and there a piece of larger size up\r\nto a diameter of nearly 2 inches; some of it sprouting.\r\n\r\n[728] Rogers, _Hist. of Agriculture and Prices_, ii.

It is then\r\ntransferred to boilers and boiled with water over a naked fire. The\r\ndecoction is run off and the residual root pressed in circular bags\r\nlike those used in the olive-mills. The liquor which is received into\r\ncisterns below the floor is then pumped up into copper pans, in which\r\nthe evaporation is conducted also over the naked fire—even to the\r\nvery last, care being taken by constant stirring to avoid burning the\r\nextract. The extract or _pasta_ is removed from the pan while warm, and\r\ntaken in small quantities to an adjoining apartment where a number of\r\nwomen are employed in rolling it into sticks. It is first weighed into\r\nportions, each of which the woman seated at the end of a long table\r\ntears with her hand into about a dozen pieces. These are passed to the\r\nwomen sitting next who roll them with their hands into cylindrical\r\nsticks, the table on which the rolling is done being of wood, and the\r\n_pasta_ moistened with oil to prevent its adhesion to the hands. Near\r\nthe further end of the table are some frames made of marble or metal,\r\nclean and bright, so arranged as to bring the sticks when rolled in\r\nthem to the proper length and thickness. When thus adjusted, they are\r\ncarefully ranged on a board, and a woman then stamps them with the name\r\nof the manufacturer. Lastly the sticks laid on boards are stacked up in\r\na room to dry.\r\n\r\nIn some establishments the vacuum-pan has been introduced for the\r\ninspissation of the decoction. At the great manufactory of Mr. A. O.\r\nClarke at Sokia near Smyrna, all the processes are performed by steam\r\npower.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Liquorice juice of good quality is met with in\r\ncylindrical sticks stamped at one end with the maker’s name or mark.\r\nThey are of various sizes, but generally not larger than 6 to 7 inches\r\nlong by about an inch in diameter. They are black, when new or warm\r\nslightly flexible, but breaking when struck, and then displaying a\r\nsharp-edged fracture, and shining conchoidal surface on which a few air\r\nbubbles are perceptible; thin splinters are translucent. The extract\r\nhas a special odour and dissolves in the mouth with a peculiar strong\r\nsweet taste. By complete drying, it loses from 11 to 17 per cent. of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nSeveral varieties of Stick Liquorice are met with in English commerce,\r\nand command widely different prices. The most famous is the _Solazzi\r\nJuice_, manufactured at Corigliano, a small town of Calabria in the\r\ngulf of Taranto, at an establishment belonging to the sons of Don\r\nOnorato Gaetani, duke of Laurenzano and prince of Piedimonte d’Alife,\r\nwho inherited the manufacture from his father-in-law, the Cavaliere\r\nDomenico Solazzi Castriota. The Solazzi Juice destined for the English\r\nmarket is usually shipped at Naples; it has for many years been wholly\r\nconsigned to two firms in London, and in quantity not always equal\r\nto the demand. Of the other varieties we may mention _Barracco_,\r\nmanufactured at the establishment of Messieurs Barracco at Cotrone on\r\nthe eastern coast of Calabria; _Corigliano_, produced at a factory\r\nat Corigliano, belonging to Baron Compagna. The sticks stamped\r\n_Pignatelli_ are from the works of Vincenzo Pignatelli, prince of\r\nStrongoli, at Torre Cerchiora, where 300 to 400 workmen are employed.\r\n\r\nThe juice is also imported in a block form, having while warm and soft\r\nbeen allowed to run into the wooden case in which it is exported.\r\nThis juice, which is known as _Liquorice Paste_, is largely imported\r\nfrom Spain and Asia Minor, but on account of a certain bitterness is\r\nunsuited for use as a sweetmeat.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Hard extract of liquorice, such as that just\r\ndescribed, is essentially different in composition and properties from\r\nthe Extract of Liquorice (_Extractum Glycyrrhizæ_) of the _British\r\nPharmacopœia_.[736] The latter is a soft, hygroscopic substance,\r\nentirely soluble in cold water, whereas the so-called _Spanish Juice_\r\nwhen treated with cold water leaves a large residue undissolved.\r\n\r\nIt has been sometimes supposed that the presence of this residue\r\nindicates adulteration, but such is far from being the fact, as was\r\nconclusively shown by the researches of a French Commission appointed\r\nto investigate the process recommended by Delondre.[737] This\r\ncommission subjected liquorice root to the successive action of cold\r\nwater, boiling water, and lastly of steam. By the first menstruum 15\r\nper cent., and by the second an additional 7½ per cent., were obtained\r\nof a hygroscopic extract much more soluble than commercial liquorice,\r\nand totally unsuitable for being moulded into sticks. The residue\r\nhaving been then exhausted by steam, 16 per cent. was obtained of an\r\nextract differing entirely from those of the previous operations.\r\nIt was a dry friable substance, cracking and falling to pieces in\r\nthe drying stove, having a sweet taste without acridity, not readily\r\ndissolving in the mouth, and very imperfectly soluble in cold water.\r\nThis then was the substance required to give firmness to the more\r\nsoluble matter, and to render possible the preparation of an extract\r\npossessing that degree of solubility and hardness which would render it\r\nan agreeable sweetmeat, as well as a permanent and stable commodity. In\r\nfact, by treating the root at once with steam according to Delondre’s\r\nprocess, the experimenters obtained 42 to 45 per cent. of extract\r\nhaving all the qualities desired in good Italian or Spanish Juice.\r\n\r\nWhen the latter substance is suspended in water undisturbed, the\r\nsoluble matter may be dissolved out, the stick still retaining its\r\noriginal form. Glycyrrhizin, which is but slightly soluble in cold\r\nwater, remains to some extent in the residue, and by an alkaline\r\nsolution may be afterwards extracted together with colouring matter and\r\nprobably also pectin. The proportion of soluble matter which the best\r\nvarieties of liquorice juice yield to cold water varies from about 60\r\nto 70 per cent. A sample of Solazzi Juice recently examined by one of\r\nus, lost 8·4 per cent. when dried at 100° C.; it was then exhausted\r\nby 60 times its weight of cold water used in successive quantities,\r\nby which means 66·8 per cent. of soluble matter were removed. The\r\nresidue consisted of minute starch granules, fragments of the root, and\r\ncolouring matter partially soluble in ammonia. Small shreds of copper\r\nwere also visible to the naked eye. The dried juice yielded 6·3 per\r\ncent. of ash.\r\n\r\n[736] Made by treating the crushed root with cold water.\r\n\r\n[737] _Journ. de Pharm._ xxx. (1856) 428; an abstract by Redwood in\r\n_Pharm. Journ._ xvi. (1857) 403.\r\n\r\nCorigliano liquorice treated in the same manner gave 71·2 per cent. of\r\nextract soluble in cold water; Barracco liquorice 64·9.\r\n\r\nThe small liquorice lozenges known as _Pontefract Cakes_ (Dunhill’s),\r\nnot previously dried, gave 71 per cent. of matter soluble in cold water.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The value of the imports of Liquorice into the United\r\nKingdom has been for the last five years as follows:—\r\n\r\n      1868      1869       1870       1871       1872\r\n    £89,482   £83,832    £70,165    £55,129    £75,991\r\n\r\nThe last named sum represents a quantity of 28,000 cwt., of which\r\n11,170 cwt. were furnished by Italy, and the remainder by Turkey,\r\nFrance, Spain and other countries.\r\n\r\nThe total exports of Liquorice Paste from Smyrna were estimated in 1872\r\nas 1,200 to 1,400 tons (24,000 to 28,000 cwt.) per annum.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Stick liquorice is sucked as a remedy for coughs, and by\r\nchildren as a sweetmeat. It is also used in lozenges, and in some\r\npharmacopœias is admitted as the raw material from which to prepare\r\nsoft extract of liquorice.\r\n\r\nThe block liquorice, of which a large quantity is imported, is chiefly\r\nused in the manufacture of tobacco for smoking and chewing.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLEUM ARACHIS.\r\n\r\n_Ground-nut oil_, _Earth-nut oil_, _Pea-nut oil_, _Arachis oil_; F.\r\n_Huile d’Arachide ou de Pistache de terre_; G. _Erdnussöl_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Arachis hypogæa_ L., a diffuse herbaceous annual\r\nplant, having stems a foot or two long, and solitary axillary flowers\r\nwith an extremely long filiform calyx-tube. After the flower withers,\r\nthe torus supporting the ovary becomes elongated as a rigid stalk,\r\nwhich bends down to the ground and forces into it the young pod, which\r\nmatures its seeds some inches below the surface. The ripe pod is\r\noblong, cylindrical, about an inch in length, indehiscent, reticulated,\r\nand contains one or two, or exceptionally even four irregularly ovoid\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nThe plant is cultivated for the sake of its nutritious oily seeds in\r\nall tropical and subtropical countries, but especially on the west\r\ncoast of Africa. It is unknown in the wild state. De Candolle[738]\r\nregards it as a native of Brazil, to which region the other species\r\nof the genus exclusively belong. But the opinion of one of us[739]\r\nis strongly in favour of the plant being indigenous to Tropical\r\nAfrica, and so is that also of Schweinfurth. Arachis is one of the\r\nmost universally cultivated plants throughout Tropical Africa, from\r\nSenegambia to lake Tanganyika. In Europe it has not proved remunerative.\r\n\r\n[738] _Géographie Botanique_, ii. (1855) 963.\r\n\r\n[739] Flückiger, _Ueber die Erdnuss—Archiv der Pharmacie_, 190. (1869)\r\n70-84, with figure.\r\n\r\n=History=—The first writer to notice Ground-Nut appears to be\r\nFernandez de Oviedo y Valdes, who lived in Hayti from A.D. 1513 to\r\n1525; he mentions in his _Cronica de las Indias_[740] that the Indians\r\ncultivated very much the fruit _Mani_, a name still used for Arachis\r\nin Cuba and in South America. A little later, Monardes,[741] described\r\na nameless subterraneous fruit, found about the river Maranon and\r\nheld in great esteem by both Indians and Spaniards. But before, the\r\nFrench colonists sent in 1555 by Admiral Coligny to the Brazilian coast\r\nhad become acquainted with the “Mandobi,” which Jean de Léry[742]\r\ndescribed quite unmistakably. Good accounts and figures of it were\r\ngiven in the following century by Johannes de Laet (1625),[743] and\r\nby Marcgraf,[744] who calls it by its Brazilian name of _Mundubi_. It\r\nis enumerated by Stisser among the rare plants cultivated by him at\r\nHelmstedt (Brunswick), about the year 1697.[745]\r\n\r\nIt is only in very recent times that the value of the Ground-Nut has\r\nbeen recognized in Europe. Jaubert, a French colonist at Gorée near\r\nCape Verde, first suggested about 1840 its importation as an oil-seed\r\ninto Marseilles, where it now constitutes one of the most important\r\narticles of trade.[746]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fat oil of _Arachis_, as obtained by pressure without\r\nheat, is almost colourless, of an agreeable faint odour and a bland\r\ntaste resembling that of olive oil. An inferior oil is obtained by\r\nwarming the seeds before pressing them. The best oil has a sp. gr. of\r\nabout 0·918; it becomes turbid at 3° C., concretes at -3° to -4°, and\r\nhardens at -7°. On exposure to air it is but slowly altered, being one\r\nof the non-drying oils. At length it thickens considerably, and assumes\r\neven in closed vessels a disagreeable rancid smell and taste.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The oil consists of the glycerides of four\r\ndifferent fatty acids. The common _Oleic Acid_, C₁₈H₃₄O₂, that is to\r\nsay its glycerin compound, is the chief constituent of Arachis oil.\r\n_Hypogæic Acid_, C₁₆H₃₀O₂, has been pointed out by Gössmann and Scheven\r\n(1854) as a new acid, whereas it is thought by other chemists to agree\r\nwith one of the fatty acids obtained from whale oil. The melting point\r\nof this acid from Arachis oil is 34-35° C. The third acid afforded by\r\nthe oil is ordinary _Palmitic Acid_, C₁₆H₃₂O₂, with a fusing point of\r\n62° C. _Arachic Acid_, C₂₀H₄₀O₂, the fourth constituent, has also been\r\nmet with among the fatty acids of butter and olive oil, and, according\r\nto Oudemans (1866), in the tallow of _Nephelium lappaceum_ L., an\r\nIndian plant of the order _Sapindaceæ_.\r\n\r\nWhen ground-nut oil is treated with hyponitric acid, which may be most\r\nconveniently evolved by heating nitric acid with a little starch, a\r\nsolid mass is obtained, which yields by crystallization from alcohol\r\n_Elaïdic_ and _Gæidinic_ acids, the former isomeric with oleic, the\r\nlatter with hypogæic acid.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—The pods are exported on an immense and ever\r\nincreasing scale from the West Coast of Africa. From this region,\r\nnot less than 66 millions of kilogrammes, value 26 millions of\r\nfrancs (£1,040,000), were imported in 1867, almost exclusively into\r\nMarseilles.

As a substitute for liquorice, the root\r\nhas been often employed by residents in the tropical countries of both\r\nhemispheres. It was introduced into the _Bengal Pharmacopœia_ of 1844,\r\nand into the _Pharmacopœia of India_ of 1868.\r\n\r\nThe seeds, of the size of a small pea, well known for their polish and\r\nbeautiful black and red colours, have given their name of _Retti_ to a\r\nweight (= 2³/₁₆ grains) used by Hindu jewellers and druggists.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The root is long, woody, tortuous and branching. The\r\nstoutest piece in our possession is as thick as a man’s finger, but\r\nmost of it is much more slender. The cortical layer is extremely thin\r\nand of a light brown or almost reddish hue. The woody part breaks with\r\na short fibrous fracture exhibiting a light yellow interior. The root\r\nhas a peculiar, disagreeable odour, and a bitterish acrid flavour\r\nleaving a faintly sweet after-taste. When cut into short lengths it has\r\na slight resemblance to liquorice, but may easily be distinguished by\r\nmeans of the microscope.\r\n\r\nMr. Moodeen Sheriff,[748] who says he has often examined the root of\r\n_Abrus_ both fresh and dried, remarks that it is far from abounding in\r\nsugar as generally considered;—that it does not possess any sweetness\r\nat all until it attains a certain size, and that even then its sweet\r\ntaste is not always well marked. As it is often mixed in the Indian\r\nbazaars with true liquorice, he thinks the latter may have sometimes\r\nbeen mistaken for it.\r\n\r\n[747] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Medicinal Plants_, part 25 (1878).\r\n\r\n[748] _Supplement to the Pharmacopœia of India_, Madras, 1869. 16.—The\r\nauthor has kindly sent us specimens of the root. We are also indebted\r\nfor authentic samples to Mr. Thwaites of the Royal Botanical Garden,\r\nCeylon, and to Mr. Prestoe of the Botanical Garden, Trinidad. The last\r\nnamed gentleman remarks—“I do not find any liquorice property in the\r\nroot, even fresh, but it is very strong in the green leaves.”\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—On a transverse section the bark exhibits some\r\nlayers of cork-cells, loaded with brown colouring matter, and then,\r\nwithin the middle zone of the bark, a comparatively thick layer of\r\nsclerenchymatous tissue. Strong liber-fibres are scattered through\r\nthe interior of the cortical tissue, but are not distributed so as to\r\nform wedge-shaped rays as met with in liquorice. In the latter the\r\nsclerenchyme (thick-walled cells) is wanting. These differences are\r\nsufficient to distinguish the two roots.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The concentrated aqueous infusion of the root of\r\nAbrus has a dark brown colour and a somewhat acrid taste accompanied\r\nby a faint sweetness. When it is mixed with an alkaline solution of\r\ntartrate of copper, red cuprous oxide is deposited after a short\r\ntime: hence we may infer that the root contains sugar. One drop of\r\nhydrochloric or other mineral acid mixed with the infusion produces a\r\nvery abundant flocculent precipitate, which is soluble in alcohol. If\r\nthe infusion of Abrus root is mixed with a very little acetic acid,\r\nan abundant precipitate is likewise obtained, but is dissolved by an\r\nexcess. This behaviour is similar to that of glycyrrhizin (see p. 181).\r\n\r\nBerzelius observed, so long ago as 1827, that the _leaves_ of Abrus\r\ncontain a sweet principle similar to that of liquorice.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The root has been used in the place of liquorice, for which it\r\nis in our opinion a very bad substitute.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETÆ MUCUNÆ.\r\n\r\n_Dolichi pubes vel setæ_; _Cowhage_, _Cow-itch_[749]; F. _Pois à\r\ngratter_, _Pois pouillieux_; G. _Juckborsten_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Mucuna pruriens_ DC. (_Dolichos pruriens_ L.,\r\n_Stizolobium pruriens_ Pers., _Mucuna prurita_ Hook.), a lofty climbing\r\nplant[750] with large, dark purple papilionaceous flowers, and downy\r\nlegumes in size and shape not unlike those of a sweet pea, common\r\nthroughout the tropical regions of both Africa, India and America.\r\n\r\n=History=—The earliest notice we have found of this plant is that of\r\nParkinson, who in his _Theater of Plants_, published in 1640, names it\r\n“_Phaseolus siliquâ hirsutâ_, the Hairy Kidney-Beane called in Zurrate\r\n[Surat] where it groweth, _Couhage_” It was subsequently described by\r\nRay (1686), who saw the plant raised from West Indian seeds, in the\r\ngarden of the Hatton family in Holborn.[751] Rheede figured it in the\r\n_Hortus Malabaricus_,[752] and it was also known to Rumphius and the\r\nother older botanists. We find it even in the pharmaceutical tariff of\r\nthe county of Nürnberg, A.D. 1714.[753]\r\n\r\n[749] These names and the following are also applied to the entire\r\npods, or even to the plant.\r\n\r\n[750] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med.

In England the drug began to attract\r\nattention in the latter part of the last century, when it was strongly\r\nrecommended by Bancroft in his _Natural History of Guiana_ (1769),\r\nand by Chamberlaine, a surgeon of London, who published an essay[754]\r\ndescriptive of its effects which went through many editions. It was\r\nintroduced into the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia of 1783, and into the\r\nLondon Pharmacopœia of 1809. At the present day it has been almost\r\ndiscarded from European medicine, but has been allowed a place in the\r\n_Pharmacopœia of India_ (1868).\r\n\r\nThe name _Cowhage_ is Hindustani, and in the modern way is written\r\n_Kiwânch_, which is generally derived from the Sanskrit _Kapi-Kachchu_,\r\nmonkey’s itch (Dr. Rice); the corruption into _Cow-itch_ is absurd.\r\n_Mucuna_ is the Brazilian name of another species mentioned in 1648 by\r\nMarcgraf.[755]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The pods are 2 to 4 inches long, about ⁴/₁₀ of an inch\r\nwide, and contain 4 to 6 seeds; they are slightly compressed and of a\r\ndark blackish brown. Each valve is furnished with a prominent ridge\r\nrunning from the apex nearly to the base, and is densely covered with\r\nrigid, pointed, brown hairs, measuring about ⅒ of an inch in length.\r\nThe hairs are perfectly straight and easily detached from the valves,\r\nout of the epidermis of which they rise. If incautiously touched, they\r\nenter the skin and occasion an intolerable itching.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—Under the microscope the hairs are seen to\r\nconsist of a single, sharply pointed, conical cell, about ¹/₄₀ of an\r\ninch in diameter at the base, with uniform brownish walls 5 mkm. thick,\r\nwhich towards the apex are slightly barbed. Occasionally a hair shows\r\none or two transverse walls. Most of the hairs contain only air; others\r\nshow a little granular matter which acquires a greenish hue on addition\r\nof alcoholic solution of perchloride of iron. If moistened with chromic\r\nacid, no structural peculiarity is revealed that calls for remark.\r\nThe walls however are somewhat separated into indistinct layers, the\r\npresence of which is confirmed by the refractive power displayed by the\r\nhairs in polarized light.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The hairs when treated with sulphuric acid and\r\niodine assume a dark brown colour. Boiling solution of potash does not\r\nconsiderably swell or alter them. They are completely decolorized by\r\nconcentrated nitric acid.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Cowhage is administered for the expulsion of intestinal worms,\r\nespecially _Ascaris lumbricoides_ and _A. vermicularis_, which it\r\neffects by reason of its mechanical structure. It is given mixed with\r\nsyrup or honey in the form of an electuary.\r\n\r\nThe root and seeds are reputed medicinal by the natives of some part of\r\nIndia. The pods when young and tender may be cooked and eaten.\r\n\r\n[754] _On the efficacy of Stizolobium or Cowhage_, Lond. 2nd ed. 1784.\r\n\r\n[755] _Hist. Nat.

It grows near the mouths of\r\nthe Niger and the Old Calabar River in the Gulf of Guinea.\r\n\r\nThe imported seeds germinate freely, but the plant, though it thrives\r\nvigorously in a hothouse, has not yet, we believe, flowered in Europe.\r\nIt has already been introduced into India and Brazil. In the latter\r\ncountry Dr. Peckolt, late of Cantagallo, has raised plants which have\r\nblossomed abundantly, producing racemes of about 30 flowers each,\r\npendent from the axils of the ternate leaves.\r\n\r\nThe flower, which is fully an inch across and of a purplish colour, has\r\nthe form of _Phaseolus_, but is distinguished from that genus by two\r\nspecial characters, namely that it has the style developed beyond the\r\nstigma backwards as a broad, flat, hooked appendage,[756] and the seeds\r\nhalf surrounded by a deeply grooved hilum.\r\n\r\n=History=—The pagan tribes of Tropical Western Africa compel persons\r\naccused of witchcraft to undergo the ordeal of swallowing some\r\nvegetable poison. One of the substances employed in this horrid custom\r\nis the seed under notice, which is administered in substance or in\r\nthe form of emulsion, or even as a clyster. It was first made known\r\nin England by Dr. W. F. Daniell about the year 1840, and subsequently\r\nalluded to in a paper read by him before the Ethnological Society in\r\n1846.[757] The highly poisonous effects of the bean were observed in\r\n1855 by Christison[758] in his own person, and in 1858 by Sharpey, who\r\nadministered it to frogs.\r\n\r\nBefore the seed became an object of commerce, it was regarded by the\r\nnatives with some mystery and was reluctantly parted with to Europeans.\r\nIt was moreover customary in Old Calabar to destroy the plant whenever\r\nfound, a few only being reserved to supply seeds for judicial purposes,\r\nand of these seeds the store was kept in the custody of the native\r\nchief. In 1859, the Rev. W. C. Thomson, a missionary on the West Coast\r\nof Africa, forwarded the plant to Professor Balfour of Edinburgh, who\r\nfigured and described it as a type of a new genus.[759]\r\n\r\n[756] The name of the genus, from ϕύσα, a bladder, was formed under the\r\nnotion that this appendage is _hollow_, which is not the fact.—Mucuna\r\ncylindrosperma Welwitsch, from Angola, is probably the same plant.

Plants_, part 6 (1876).\r\n\r\nFraser of Edinburgh (about 1863 or earlier) discovered the specific\r\npower of the seed in contracting the pupil, when the alcoholic extract\r\nis applied to the eye. These myotic effects, counteracting those\r\nof atropine and hyoscyamine, were further examined by many other\r\nexperimenters on mammals or birds. The action of the poison when taken\r\ninternally was found rapidly to affect the cardiac contractions and\r\nfinally to paralyze the heart.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit of _Physostigma_ is a dehiscent, oblong legume\r\nabout 7 inches in length, containing 2 or 3 seeds. The latter, commonly\r\nknown as _Calabar Beans_, are 1 to 1⅜ inches long, about ⁶/₈ of an inch\r\nbroad, and ⁴/₈ to ⅝ of an inch in thickness, weighing on an average\r\ntwenty seeds, 67 grains each.\r\n\r\nThey have an oblong, subreniform outline, one side being straight or\r\nbut slightly incurved, the other boldly arched. The latter is marked\r\nby a broad furrow, ⅛ of an inch wide, bordered with raised edges, and\r\nrunning from the micropyle, which is a small funnel-shaped depression,\r\nquite round the opposite end of the seed. In the middle of this\r\nremarkable furrow the raphe is seen as a long raised suture running\r\nfrom end to end. The surface of the seed is somewhat rough, but has a\r\ndull polish; it is of a deep chocolate-brown, passing into a lighter\r\ntint on the ridges bordering the furrow. The latter is black, dull, and\r\nfinely rugose.\r\n\r\nWhen the seed is broken the cotyledons are found adherent to the\r\ntesta, with a large cavity between them. The air thus included causes\r\nthe seeds to float on water, but they sink immediately when broken.\r\nAfter digestion for some hours in warm water, the testa having been\r\npreviously cracked, the whole seed softens and swells so that its\r\nstructure may be easily studied. Each cotyledon is then seen to be\r\nmarked on the hilum-side by a long shallow furrow, at one end of\r\nwhich, just below the micropyle, lies the plumule and radicle. A dark\r\nbrown inner membrane, constituting part of the testa, surrounds the\r\ncotyledons.\r\n\r\nThe seeds have scarcely any taste, or not more than an ordinary bean;\r\nnor in the dry state have they any odour. After being boiled, or when\r\ntheir alcoholic tincture is evaporated, an odour suggesting cantharides\r\nis developed.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The cotyledons are built up of large globular\r\nor ovoid cells, those of the outermost layer being smaller and of\r\nrather cubic form. This parenchyme is loaded with starch granules,\r\nfrequently as much as 50 mkm. in diameter. Their interior part is less\r\ndistinctly stratified than the outer; the hollow centre radiates in\r\nvarious directions around the axis of the ovate granule. Polarized\r\nlight does not show a cross as in other more globular starch granules,\r\nbut two elliptic curves approaching one another near the axis of the\r\ngranule. Similar starch granules are commonly met with in the seeds of\r\n_Leguminosæ_.\r\n\r\nIn the Calabar seeds the starch is accompanied by numerous particles\r\nof albuminous matter becoming distinctly perceptible by addition of\r\niodine, which imparts to them an orange colouration.\r\n\r\nThe shell of the seed is built up of four different layers; the\r\nprevailing layer consists of very long, simply cylindrical cells,\r\ndensely packed so as to form only one radial row. Tison[760] has\r\nendeavoured to ascertain in what region of the seed the active\r\nprinciple is lodged; and he has arrived at the conclusion that its seat\r\nis the granular protoplasmic particles, which alone acquire an orange\r\ntint by the action of weak caustic alkalis.\r\n\r\n[760] _Histoire de la Fève de Calabar_, Paris, 1873. 38.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Jobst and Hesse[761] proved in 1863 that the\r\npoisonous nature of Calabar bean depends upon an alkaloid, to which\r\nthey gave the name _Physostigmine_. It is obtained by the method\r\ngenerally adopted for extracting analogous substances, that is, by\r\nprecipitating one of its salts from an aqueous solution by bicarbonate\r\nof sodium, and dissolving out the base with ether or benzol. As\r\nextracted by these chemists, physostigmine is an amorphous mass of\r\ndecidedly alkaline reaction, soluble in much water and in acids.\r\nOn exposure to the air the solution soon becomes red, or sometimes\r\nintensely blue, a partial decomposition of the alkaloid taking place.\r\nThe red coloration may even be observed in the aqueous infusion of a\r\nfew cotyledons. It disappears by sulphuretted hydrogen or sulphurous\r\nacid, but returns if these reducing agents are allowed to evaporate.\r\n\r\nHesse[762] ascertained (1867) that physostigmine consists of\r\nC₃₀H₂₁N₃O₄; he now obtained it perfectly colourless and tasteless,\r\nsoftening at 40° C., fusing at 45°, but not supporting a heat of 100°\r\nC., without decomposition, which is manifested by a red coloration.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 Vée and Leven,[763] by treating the powdered unpeeled seed in\r\nnearly the same way, prepared an alkaloid which they called _Eserine_.\r\nIt differs from Hesse’s physostigmine in that it forms colourless,\r\nrhomboidal, tabular crystals of a bitter taste, melting at 90° C. It\r\ndissolves easily in ether, alcohol, or chloroform, but very sparingly\r\nin water. The last named solution is alkaline, and reddens by exposure\r\nto the air.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed by some writers, as Tison,[764] that eserine is only the\r\npure form of physostigmine; but at present we feel hardly warranted in\r\nadmitting the identity of the two substances.\r\n\r\nHarnack and Witkowski in 1876 ascertained the presence of another\r\nalkaloid in the seed, which they called _Calabarine_. It is nearly\r\ninsoluble in ether and also very different from physostigmine in its\r\nphysiological action, but somewhat similar to strychnine. Calabarine\r\nis consequently not to be found in those preparations of calabar bean\r\nwhich have been obtained or purified by means of ether.\r\n\r\nHesse (1878) exhausted the cotyledons of Physostigma with petroleum\r\nether, and obtained crystals of a new indifferent substance C₂₆H₄₄+OH₂,\r\nwhich he called _Phytosterin_. It is closely allied to Cholesterin,\r\nbut, in its solution in chloroform, devoid of rotatory power and\r\nmelting at 133°. Cholesterin melts at 145°, and deviates, in its\r\nethereal solution, the ray of polarized light to the left. Phytosterin\r\nalso occurs in peas; Hesse suggests that the crystallized appearance\r\nof alkaloids as prepared by former observers was perhaps due to\r\nphytosterin.\r\n\r\nFrom the cotyledons _per se_, cold water extracts mucilage,\r\nprecipitable by neutral acetate of lead. The watery infusion contains\r\nalso albumin, which may be coagulated by heat or by alcohol. The\r\ninfusion is colourless, does not redden litmus, nor does it contain\r\nsugar in appreciable proportion; a few drops of solution of potash\r\ncause it to assume an orange colour. An infusion of the shell of the\r\nseed is already of this colour, but the tint is intensified by caustic\r\nalkali.\r\n\r\n[761] Liebig’s _Annalen der Chem. u.

The proportion of\r\nstarch according to Teich[765] amounts to 48 per cent., the albuminous\r\nmatter to 23 per cent. The entire seed furnishes 3 per cent. of ash,\r\nchiefly phosphate of potash. These constituents do not widely differ\r\nin proportion from those found in the common bean, which yields 23 to\r\n25 per cent. of albuminous matters, and 32 to 38 per cent. of starch,\r\nbesides 1 to 3 per cent. of oil.\r\n\r\n[765] _Chemische Untersuchung der Calabarbohne_.—Inauguralschrift, St.\r\nPetersburg, 1867. We calculate the albuminous matters with reference to\r\n_Teich’s_ analysis, which proved the kernels to contain 3·65 per cent.\r\nof nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe shells of Calabar bean are stated by Fraser to be by no means\r\ndevoid of active principle.\r\n\r\nVée asserts that if to a solution of eserine, a little potash, lime,\r\nor carbonate of sodium be added, there is developed a red colour which\r\nrapidly increases in intensity. This colour is transient, passing into\r\nyellow, green and blue. If chloroform is shaken with such coloured\r\nsolution, it takes up the colour; ether on the other hand remains\r\nuncoloured.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Calabar has been hitherto chiefly employed as an ophthalmic\r\nmedicine, for the purpose of contracting the pupil. It has however been\r\noccasionally administered in tetanus and in neuralgic, rheumatic, and\r\nother diseases.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Other seeds are sometimes fraudulently mixed with\r\nCalabar beans. We have noticed in particular those of a _Mucuna_ and\r\nof the Oil Palm, _Elæis guineensis_ Jacq.

In the\r\nGovernment forests of the Madras Presidency, it is one of the _reserved\r\ntrees_, the felling of which is placed under restrictions.\r\n\r\n_Pt. indicus_ Willd., a tree of Southern India, the Malayan Peninsula\r\nand the Indian and Philippine Islands, is capable of yielding kino, and\r\nis the source of the small supplies of that drug that were formerly\r\nshipped from Moulmein.\r\n\r\nSeveral other plants afford substances bearing the name of _Kino_,\r\nwhich will be noticed at the conclusion of the present article.\r\n\r\n=History=—The introduction of kino into European medicine is due to\r\nFothergill, an eminent physician and patron of economic botany of\r\nthe last century. The drug which Fothergill examined was brought from\r\nthe river Gambia in West Africa as a rare sort of Dragon’s Blood, and\r\nwas described by him in 1757[766] under the name of _Gummi rubrum\r\nastringens Gambiense_. It had been noticed at least twenty years before\r\nas a production of the Gambia, by Moore, factor to the Royal African\r\nCompany, who says that the tree yielding it is called in the Mandingo\r\nlanguage _Kano_.[767] Specimens of this tree were sent to England in\r\n1805 by the celebrated traveller Mungo Park, and recognized some years\r\nlater as identical with the _Pterocarpus erinaceus_ of Poiret.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that African kino continued to reach England for some\r\nyears, for we find “_Gummi rubrum astringens_” regularly valued in the\r\nstock of a London druggist[768] from 1776 to 1792.\r\n\r\nDuncan in the _Edinburgh Dispensatory_ of 1803, while asserting\r\nthat “_kino is brought to us from Africa_,” admits that some, not\r\ndistinguishable from it, is imported from Jamaica. In a later edition\r\nof the same work (1811), he says that the African drug is no longer\r\nto be met with, and alludes to its place being supplied by other\r\nkinds, as that of Jamaica, that imported by the East India Company,\r\nand that of New South Wales derived from _Eucalyptus resinifera_ Sm.\r\nIt will thus be seen that at the commencement of the present century\r\nseveral substances, produced in widely distant regions, bore the name\r\nof _Kino_. That however which was principally used in the place of\r\nthe old African drug, was _East Indian_ Kino, the botanical origin of\r\nwhich was shown by Wight and by Royle[769] (1844-46) to be _Pterocarpus\r\nMarsupium_ Roxb.,—a tree which, curiously enough, is closely allied to\r\nthe kino tree of Tropical Africa.\r\n\r\nThis is the drug which is recognized as legitimate kino in all the\r\nprincipal pharmacopœias of Europe. It appears to have been first\r\nprepared for the European market in the early part of the present\r\ncentury, on a plantation of the East India Company called Anjarakandy,\r\na few miles from Tellicherry on the Malabar Coast; but as we learn from\r\nour friend Dr. Cleghorn, it was not grown there but on the ghats a\r\nshort distance inland.\r\n\r\n=Extraction=—Kino is the juice of the tree, dried without artificial\r\nheat.[770] As it exudes, it has the appearance of red currant\r\njelly, but hardens in a few hours after exposure to the air. In the\r\nGovernment forests of the Malabar Coast whence the supplies are\r\nobtained, permission to collect the drug is granted on payment of a\r\nsmall fee, and on the understanding that the tapping is performed\r\nskilfully and without damage to the timber. The method pursued is\r\nthis:—A perpendicular incision with lateral ones leading into it, is\r\nmade in the trunk, at the foot of which is placed a vessel to receive\r\nthe outflowing juice. This juice soon thickens, and when sufficiently\r\ndried by exposure to the sun and air, is packed into wooden boxes for\r\nexportation.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Malabar kino[771] consists of dark, blackish-red,\r\nangular fragments rarely larger than a pea, easily splitting into\r\nstill smaller pieces, which are seen to be perfectly transparent, of a\r\nbright garnet hue, and amorphous under the microscope. In cold water\r\nthey sink, but partially dissolve by agitation, forming a solution\r\nof very astringent taste, and a pale flocky residue. The latter is\r\ntaken up when the liquid is made to boil, and deposited on cooling in\r\na more voluminous form. Kino dissolves almost entirely in spirit of\r\nwine (·838), affording a dark reddish solution, acid to litmus paper,\r\nwhich by long keeping sometimes assumes a gelatinous condition. It is\r\nreadily soluble in solution of caustic alkali, and to a large extent in\r\na saturated solution of sugar.\r\n\r\n[766] _Medical Observations and Inquiries_, i.

(1846) 495.\r\n\r\n[770] Cleghorn, _Forests and Gardens of South India_, 1861. 13.—Also\r\nfrom information communicated by him orally.\r\n\r\n[771] Our sample obtained from _Pt. Marsupium_ Roxb. on the Sigúr Ghat,\r\nFeb. 1868, was kindly submitted to us by Mr. McIvor of Ootacamund.—We\r\nfind it to agree with commercial East Indian Kino.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Cold water forms with kino a reddish solution,\r\nwhich is at first not altered if a fragment of ferrous sulphate is\r\nadded. But a violet colour is produced as soon as the liquid is\r\ncautiously neutralized. This can be done by diluting it with common\r\nwater (containing bicarbonate of calcium) or by adding a drop of\r\nsolution of acetate of potassium. Yet the fact of kino developing an\r\nintense violet colour in presence of a proto-salt of iron, may most\r\nevidently be shown by shaking it with water, and iron reduced by\r\nhydrogen. The filtered liquid is of a brilliant violet, and may be\r\nevaporated at 100° without turning green; the dried residue even again\r\nforms a violet solution with water. By long keeping the violet liquid\r\ngelatinizes. It is decolorized by acids, and turns red on addition\r\nof an alkali, whether caustic or bicarbonated. Catechu, as well as\r\ncrystallized catechin, show the same behaviour, but these solutions\r\nquickly turn green on exposure to air.\r\n\r\nSolutions of acids, of metallic salts, or of chromates produce copious\r\nprecipitates in an aqueous solution of kino. Ferric chloride forms a\r\ndirty green precipitate, and is at the same time reduced to a ferrous\r\nsalt. Dilute mineral acids or alkalis do not occasion any decided\r\nchange of colour, but the former give rise to light brownish-red\r\nprecipitates of _Kino-tannic Acid_. By boiling for some time an aqueous\r\nsolution of kino-tannic acid, a red precipitate, _Kino-red_, is\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nKino in its general behaviour is closely allied to Pegu catechu,\r\nand yields by similar treatment the same products, that is to say,\r\nit affords _Pyrocatechin_ when submitted to dry distillation, and\r\n_Protocatechuic Acid_ together with _Phloroglucin_ when melted with\r\ncaustic soda or potash.\r\n\r\nYet in catechu the tannic acid is accompanied by a considerable amount\r\nof catechin, which may be removed directly by exhaustion with ether.\r\nKino, on the other hand, yields to ether only a minute percentage\r\nof a substance, whose scaly crystals display under the microscope\r\nthe character of _Pyrocatechin_, rather than that of catechin, which\r\ncrystallizes in prisms. The crystals extracted from kino dissolve\r\nfreely in cold water, which is not the case with catechin, and this\r\nsolution assumes a fine green if a very dilute solution of ferric\r\nchloride is added, and turns red on addition of an alkali. This is the\r\nbehaviour of catechin as well as of pyrocatechin; but the difference\r\nin solubility speaks in favour of the crystals afforded by kino being\r\npyrocatechin rather than catechin.\r\n\r\nWe thought pyrocatechin must also occur in the mother plant of kino,\r\nbut this does not prove to be the case, no indication of its presence\r\nbeing perceptible either in the fresh bark or wood.[772]\r\n\r\nEtti (1878) extracted from kino colourless prisms of _Kinoïn_ by\r\nboiling the drug with twice its weight of hydrochloric acid, about 1·03\r\nsp. gr. On cooling, kino-red separates, very little of it remaining in\r\nsolution together with kinoïn. The latter is extracted by exhausting\r\nthe liquid with ether, which by evaporation affords crystals of kinoïn.\r\nThey should be recrystallized from boiling water; they agree with the\r\nformula C₁₄H₁₂O₆, which is to be regarded as that of a methylated\r\ngallic ether of pyrocatechin, viz., C₆H₄ (OCH₃) C₇H₅O₅.\r\n\r\nKinoïn by heating it to 130° C. gives off water and turns red:\r\n\r\n    2 C₁₄H₁₂O₆ = OH₂ · C₂₈H₂₂O₁₁.\r\n\r\nThe latter product is an amorphous mass agreeing with kino-red; by\r\nheating it at 160-170° it again loses water, thus affording another\r\nanhydride.\r\n\r\nEtti succeeded in preparing methylic chloride, pyrocatechin CH₄(OH)₂ as\r\nwell as gallic acid C₇H₆O₅, by decomposing kinoïn.\r\n\r\nWe have prepared kinoïn from _Australian kino_ (see page 198), but\r\nfailed in obtaining it from Malabar kino, which however Etti states to\r\nhave used. Kino affords about 1½ per cent. of kinoïn.\r\n\r\nThe solutions of kinoïn turn red on addition of ferric salts.\r\n\r\nCommercial kino yielded us 1·3 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The quantity of true kino collected in the Madras forests is\r\ncomparatively small, probably not exceeding a ton or two annually. The\r\ndrug is often shipped from Cochin.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Kino is administered as an astringent. It is said to be used in\r\nthe manufacture of wines, and it might be employed if cheap enough in\r\ntanning and dyeing.\r\n\r\nOther sorts of Kino.\r\n\r\n1. _Butea Kino_, _Butea Gum_, _Bengal Kino_, _Palas or Pulas Kino_,\r\n_Gum of the Palas or Dhak Tree_.\r\n\r\nThis is an exudation from _Butea frondosa_ Roxb. (_Leguminosæ_), a\r\ntree of India and Burma, well known under the name of _Palas_ or\r\n_Dhak_, and conspicuous for its splendid, large, orange, papilionaceous\r\nflowers.[773] According to Roxburgh it flows during the hot season from\r\nnatural fissures or from wounds made in the bark, as a red juice which\r\nsoon hardens into a ruby-coloured, brittle, astringent gum.\r\n\r\n[772] We have to thank Mr. Broughton, late of the Cinchona Plantations,\r\nOotacamund, for determining this point. In the bark almost saturated\r\nwith fresh liquid kino, he utterly failed to obtain any indication of\r\npyrocatechin by the tests which he found to render it easily evident in\r\ndry kino.\r\n\r\n[773] See Nees von Esenbeck, _Plantæ medicinales_, Düsseldorf, iii.\r\n(1833) tab. 79.\r\n\r\nAuthentic specimens of this kino have been placed at our disposal by\r\nMr. Moodeen Sheriff of Madras and by Dr. J. Newton of Bellary. That\r\nreceived from the first-named gentleman consists of flattish, angular\r\nfragments (the largest about ½ an inch across) and small drops or\r\ntears of a very dark, ruby-coloured gum, which when held to the light\r\nis seen to be perfectly transparent. The flat pieces have been mostly\r\ndried on leaves, an impression of the veins of which they retain on\r\none side, while the other is smooth and shining. The substance has a\r\npure astringent taste, but no odour. It yielded us 1·8 per cent. of ash\r\nand contained 13·5 per cent. of water. Ether removes from it a small\r\nquantity of _pyrocatechin_. Boiling alcohol dissolves this kino to the\r\nextent of 46 per cent.; the solution which is but little coloured,\r\nproduces an abundant greyish-green precipitate with perchloride of\r\niron, and a white one with acetate of lead. It may be hence inferred\r\nthat a tannic acid, probably kino-tannic acid, constitutes about half\r\nthe weight of the drug, the remainder of which is formed of a soluble\r\nmucilaginous substance which we have not isolated in a state of purity.\r\nBy submitting the Butea kino of Mr. Moodeen Sheriff to dry distillation\r\nwe obtained pyrocatechin.\r\n\r\nThe sample from Dr. Newton is wholly in transparent drops and\r\nstalactitic pieces, considerably paler than that just described, but of\r\nthe same beautiful ruby tint. The fragments dissolve freely and almost\r\ncompletely in cold water, the solution being neutral and exhibiting the\r\nsame reactions as the former sample.\r\n\r\nButea kino, which in India is used in the place of Malabar kino, was\r\nlong confounded with the latter by European pharmacologists, though\r\nthe Indian names of the two substances are quite different. It is not\r\nobtained exclusively from _B. frondosa_, the allied _B. superba_ Roxb.\r\nand _B. parviflora_ Roxb. affording a similar exudation.\r\n\r\n2. _African or Gambia Kino._—Of this substance we have a specimen\r\ncollected by Daniell[774] in the very locality whence it was obtained\r\nby Moore in 1733 (see p. 195), and by Park at the commencement of the\r\npresent century. The tree yielding it, which still bears the Mandingo\r\nname _Kano_, and grows to a height of 40 to 50 feet, is _Pterocarpus\r\nerinaceus_ Poiret, a native of Tropical Western Africa from Senegambia\r\nto Angola. The juices exude naturally from crevices in the bark, but\r\nmuch more plentifully by incisions; it soon coagulates, becoming deep\r\nblood-red and remarkably brittle. That in our possession is in very\r\nsmall, shining, angular fragments, which in a proper light appear\r\ntransparent and of a deep ruby colour. In solubility and chemical\r\ncharacters, we can trace no difference between it and the kino of the\r\nallied _Pt. Marsupium_ Roxb. This kino does not now find its way to\r\nEngland as a regular article of trade. From the statement of Welwitsch,\r\nit appears that the Portuguese of Angola employ it under the name of\r\n_Sangue de Drago_.[775]\r\n\r\n3. _Australian, Botany Bay, or Eucalyptus Kino._—For some years past,\r\nthe London drug market has been supplied with considerable quantities\r\nof kino from Australia; in fact at one period this kino was the only\r\nsort to be purchased.\r\n\r\n[774] See his paper _On the Kino Tree of West Africa, Pharm. Journ._\r\nxiv. (1855) 55.\r\n\r\n[775] _Madeiras e Drogas medicinaes de Angola_, Lisboa, 1862, 37.\r\n\r\nAs it is the produce of numerous species of _Eucalyptus_, it is not\r\nsurprising that it presents considerable diversity of appearance. The\r\nbetter qualities closely agree with Pterocarpus kino. They are in\r\ndark reddish-brown masses or grains, which when in thin fragments are\r\nseen to be transparent, of a garnet red hue and quite amorphous. The\r\nsubstance is mostly collected by the sawyers and wood-splitters. It is\r\nfound within the trunks of trees of all sizes, in flattened cavities of\r\nthe otherwise solid wood which are often parallel to the annual rings.\r\nIn such place the kino, which is at first a viscid liquid, becomes\r\ninspissated and subsequently hard and brittle. It may also be obtained\r\nin a liquid state by incisions in the stems of growing trees: such\r\nliquid kino has occasionally been brought into the London market; it is\r\na viscid treacle-like fluid, yielding by evaporation about 35 per cent.\r\nof solid kino.[776]\r\n\r\nAuthentic specimens of the kino of 16 species of _Eucalyptus_ sent\r\nfrom Australia by F. von Müller, have been examined by Wiesner of\r\nVienna.[777] He found the drug to be in most cases readily soluble in\r\nwater or in spirit of wine, the solution being of a very astringent\r\ntaste. The solution gave with sulphuric acid a pale red, flocculent\r\nprecipitate of _Kino-tannic Acid_; with perchloride of iron (as in\r\ncommon kino) a dusky greenish precipitate,—except in the case of the\r\nkino of _E. obliqua_ L’Hér. (Stringy-bark Tree), the solution of which\r\nwas coloured dark violet.\r\n\r\nWiesner further states, that Eucalyptus kino affords a little\r\n_Catechin_[778] and _Pyrocatechin_. It contains no pectinous matter,\r\nbut in some varieties a gum-like that of _Acacia_. In one sort, the\r\nkino of _E. gigantea_ Hook,[779] gum is so abundant that the drug is\r\nnearly insoluble in spirit of wine.\r\n\r\nBy Etti’s process, as given at page 197, we obtained kinoïn from an\r\nAustralian Kino, which contained numerous fragments of the wood. We\r\nnoticed that both Australian and Malabar kino emitted a somewhat\r\nbalsamic odour, when they were treated with hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nFrom this examination, it is evident that the better varieties of\r\nEucalyptus kino, such for instance as those derived from _E. rostrata_\r\nSchlecht. (_Red_ or _White Gum_, or _Flooded Gum_ of the colonists),\r\n_E. corymbosa_ Sm. (_Blood-wood_) and _E. citriodora_ Hook., possess\r\nthe properties of Pterocarpus kino and might with no disadvantage be\r\nsubstituted for it.\r\n\r\n[776] Victoria Exhibition, 1861.—Jurors’ Report on Class 3. p. 59.\r\n\r\n[777] _Zeitschrift des österreich.

Marsupium_ Roxb., from which it differs\r\nchiefly in having broader leaflets always in threes. It is a native\r\nof the southern part of the Indian Peninsula, as Canara, Mysore,\r\nTravancore and the Coromandel Coast, but also occurs in Mindanao, in\r\nthe southern Philippines. In India the districts in which the wood is\r\nat present chiefly obtained are the forests of the southern portion of\r\nthe Kurnool Hills, Cuddapah and North Arcot (W. and N.W. of Madras).\r\nThe tree is now being raised in regular plantations.[780]\r\n\r\nThe wood is a staple article of produce, and the felling of the trees\r\nis strictly controlled by the forest inspectors. The fine trunk-wood\r\nis highly valued by the natives for pillars in their temples and other\r\nbuildings, as well as for turnery. The stumps and roots are exported to\r\nEurope as a dye-stuff, mostly from Madras.\r\n\r\n=History=—It is difficult to tell whether the appellation _Red_\r\nSandal-wood used in connexion with _Yellow_ and _White_ Sandal-wood\r\nby some of the earlier writers on drugs, was intended to indicate\r\nthe inodorous dyewood under notice or the aromatic wood of a species\r\nof _Santalum_. Yet when Marco Polo[781] alludes to the sandal-wood\r\nimported into China, and to the _red_ sandal (“_Cendal vermeil_”) which\r\ngrows in the island of Necuveran (Nicobar), it is impossible to doubt\r\nthat he intended by this latter name some such substance as that under\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nGarcia de Orta, who wrote at Goa in the middle of the 16th century,\r\nclearly distinguished the fragrant sandal of Timor from the red\r\ninodorous wood of Tenasserim and the Coromandel Coast. It is remarkable\r\nthat the wood of _Pt. santalinus_ is distinguished to the present\r\nday in all the languages of India by names signifying _red-coloured\r\nsandal-wood_, though it has none whatever of the peculiarities of the\r\nodorous wood of _Santalum_. Red Sanders Wood was formerly supposed to\r\npossess medicinal powers: these are now disregarded, and it is retained\r\nin use only as a colouring agent.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle ages, it was used as well as alkanet for culinary\r\npurposes, such as the colouring of sauces and other articles of food.\r\nThe price in England between 1326 and 1399 was very variable, but on an\r\naverage exceeded 3_s._ per lb.[782] Many entries for the purchase of\r\nRed Sanders along with spices and groceries, occur in the accounts of\r\nthe Monastery of Durham, A.D. 1530-34.[783]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The wood found in English commerce is mostly that of the\r\nlower parts of the stem and that of the thickest roots. It appears\r\nin the market in ponderous, irregular logs, rarely exceeding the\r\nthickness of a man’s thigh and commonly much smaller, 3, 4 or 5 feet in\r\nlength; they are without bark or sapwood, and are externally of a dark\r\ncolour. The internal wood is of a deep, rich, blood-red, exhibiting in\r\ntransverse section zones of a lighter tint, and taking a fine polish.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, druggists generally buy the wood rasped into small\r\nchips, which are of a deep reddish-brown hue, tasteless and nearly\r\nwithout odour.\r\n\r\n\r\n[780] (Beddome), _Report of the Conservator of Forests_, for 1869-70,\r\nMadras, 1870, pp. 3. 39. 123; for figure of the tree, see _Flora\r\nSylvatica of Southern India_ of the same author, tab. xxii.\r\n\r\n[781] Pauthier, _Livre de Marco Polo_, 580—_Pt. indicus_ Willd. grows\r\nin the adjacent Andaman Islands.\r\n\r\n[782] Rogers, _Agriculture and Prices in England_, 1866, i. 631, ii.\r\n545, &c.—The average price of a sheep during the same period was about\r\n1_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n[783] _Durham Household Book_, Surtees Soc. 1844. 215; also Pegge,\r\n_Form of Cury_, Lond. 1780. p. xv.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The wood is built up for the greater part\r\nof long pointed cells, having thick walls (libriform). Through this\r\nligneous tissue, there are scattered small groups of very large\r\nvessels. In a direction parallel to the circumference of the stem,\r\nthere are less coloured small parenchymatous layers, running from one\r\nvascular bundle to another. The whole tissue is finally traversed by\r\nvery narrow medullary rays, which are scarcely perceptible to the\r\nunaided eye. The parenchymatous cells are each loaded with one crystal\r\nof oxalate of calcium, which are so large that, in a piece of the wood\r\nbroken longitudinally, they may be distinguished without a lens. The\r\ncolouring matter is contained especially in the walls of the vessels\r\nand the ligneous cells.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Cold water or fatty oil (almond or olive)\r\nabstracts scarcely anything from the wood, and hot water but very\r\nlittle. On the other hand, ether, spirit of wine, alkaline solutions,\r\nor concentrated acetic acid, readily dissolves out the colouring\r\nmatter. Essential oils of bitter almond or clove take up a good deal\r\nof the red substance; that of turpentine none at all. This resinoid\r\nsubstance, termed _Santalic Acid_ or _Santalin_,[784] is said to form\r\nmicroscopic prismatic crystals of a fine ruby colour, devoid of odour\r\nand taste, fusing at 104° C., insoluble in water but neutralizing\r\nalkalis and forming with them uncrystallizable salts.\r\n\r\nWeidel (1870) exhausted the wood with boiling water, containing a\r\nlittle potash, and obtained by means of hydrochloric acid a red\r\nprecipitate, which was redissolved in boiling alcohol and then\r\nfurnished _colourless_ crystals of _Santal_, C₈H₆O₃. They are devoid of\r\nodour or taste, not soluble in water, benzol, chloroform, bisulphide of\r\ncarbon, and but sparingly in ether. Santal yields with potash a faintly\r\nyellow solution which soon turns red and green. The wood afforded\r\nWeidel not more than 3 per mille of santal.\r\n\r\nCazeneuve (1874)[785] mixed 4 parts of the wood with 1 part of slaked\r\nlime, and exhausted the dried powder with ether containing a little\r\nalcohol. After the evaporation of the ether, a small amount of\r\ncolourless crystals of _Pterocarpin_ was obtained, which were purified\r\nby recrystallization from boiling alcohol. They melt at 83° C., and are\r\nabundantly soluble in chloroform, in bisulphide of carbon, very little\r\nin cold alcohol, not at all in water. Pterocarpin agrees with the\r\nformula C₁₇H₁₆O₅. It yields a red solution with concentrated sulphuric\r\nacid, and a green with nitric acid 1·4 sp. gr. By submitting it to\r\ndestructive distillation pyrocatechin appears to be formed.\r\n\r\nFranchimont (1879) assigns the formula C₁₇H₁₆O₆ to another principle\r\nof Red Sanders Wood, which he isolated by means of alcohol. It is\r\nan amorphous substance, melting at 105°. By extracting the wood\r\nwith a solution of carbonate of sodium, Hagenbach (1872) obtained a\r\nfluorescent solution. Red Sanders Wood yielded us of ash only 0·8 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—In the official year 1869-70, Red Sanders Wood produced to\r\nthe Madras Government a revenue of 26,015 rupees (£2,601). The quantity\r\ntaken from the forests was reported as 1,161,799 lb.\r\n\r\n[784] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, xvi. (1864) 259; the formula assigned to\r\nsantalic acid (C₁₅H₁₄O₅) appears to be doubtful. Weidel in proposing\r\nthe formula C₁₄H₁₂O₄ points out that it may be allied to alizarin,\r\nC₁₄H₈O₄.\r\n\r\n[785] See _Dictionnaire de Chimie_, art. _Santaline_, p. 1434, and for\r\nparticulars: Cazeneuve, _Recherche et extraction des alcaloïdes_, etc.\r\nParis, 1875. 66. It would appear that the author obtained about 4 per\r\n_mille_ of pterocarpin from the wood.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Red Sanders Wood is scarcely employed in pharmacy except for\r\ncolouring the Compound Tincture of Lavender; but it has numerous uses\r\nin the arts. The latter applies also to the wood of _Pterocarpus\r\nangolensis_ DC., which is largely exported from the French colony of\r\nGaboon; it is the “Santal rouge d’Afrique of the French,” or Barwood of\r\nthe English commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALSAMUM TOLUTANUM.\r\n\r\n_Balsam of Tolu_; F. _Baume de Tolu_; G. _Tolubalsam_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Myroxylon Toluifera_ H B K. (_Toluifera Balsamum_\r\nMiller, _Myrospermum toluiferum_ A. Rich.),[786] an elegant and lofty\r\nevergreen tree with a straight stem, often as much as 40 to 60 feet\r\nfrom the ground to the first branch. It is a native of Venezuela, and\r\nNew Granada,—probably also of Ecuador and Brazil.\r\n\r\n=History=—The first published account of Balsam of Tolu, is that of the\r\nSpanish physician Monardes, who in his treatise on the productions of\r\nthe West Indies, which in its complete form first appeared at Seville\r\nin 1574,[787] relates how the early explorers of South America observed\r\nthat the Indians collected this drug by making incisions in the trunk\r\nof the tree. Below the incisions they affixed shells of a peculiar\r\nblack wax to receive the balsam, which being collected in a district\r\nnear Cartagena called _Tolu_, took its name from that place. He adds\r\nthat it is much esteemed both by Indians and Spaniards, that the latter\r\nbuy it at a high price, and that they have lately brought it to Spain,\r\nwhere it is considered to be as good as the famous Balsam of Mecca.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Hernandez, who lived in 1561-1577 in Mexico, stated[788] that\r\nthe balsam of the province of Tolu was thought to be quite as useful\r\nas, if not superior to, “balsamum indicum,” _i.e._ peruvianum.\r\n\r\nA specimen agreeing with this description was given to Clusius[789]\r\nin 1581 by Morgan, apothecary to Queen Elizabeth, but the drug was\r\ncertainly not common till a much later period. In the price-list of\r\ndrugs of the city of Frankfort of 1669, _Balsamus tolutanum_ (sic)\r\nis expressly mentioned,[790] but there can be but little doubt\r\nthat _Balsamum Americanum resinosum_[791] or _siccum_ or _durum_\r\nas occurring in many other tariffs of the 17th century, printed in\r\nGermany, was also the balsam under notice;[792] in a similar list\r\nemanating from the city of Basle in 1646,[793] we noticed _B. indicum\r\nalbum_, _B. peruvianum_ and _B. siccum_,—the last with the explanatory\r\nwords, “_trockner Balsam in der Kürbsen_” (_i.e._ in gourds), meaning\r\nprobably balsam of Tolu.\r\n\r\n[786] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med.

Humboldt and Bonpland saw\r\nit in several places in New Granada during their travels (1799-1804),\r\nbut succeeded only in gathering a few leaves. Among recent collectors,\r\nWarszewicz, Triana, Sutton Hayes, and Seemann were successful only in\r\nobtaining leaves. Weir in 1863 was more happy, for by causing a large\r\ntree of nearly 2 feet diameter to be felled, he procured good herbarium\r\nspecimens including pods, but no flowers. Owing to this tree having\r\nbeen much wounded for balsam, its foliage and fruits were singularly\r\nsmall and stunted, and its branches overgrown with lichens.\r\n\r\nThat which botanists had failed to do, has been accomplished by an\r\nornithologist, Mr. Anton Goering, who, travelling in Venezuela to\r\ncollect birds and insects, made it a special object, at the urgent\r\nrequest of one of us (H.), to procure complete specimens of the\r\nBalsam of Tolu tree. By dint of much perseverance and by watching for\r\nthe proper season, Mr. Goering obtained in December 1868 excellent\r\nflowering specimens and young fruits, and subsequently mature seeds\r\nfrom which plants have been raised in England, Ceylon and Java.\r\n\r\n=Extraction=—The most authentic information we possess on this\r\nsubject is derived from Mr. John Weir, plant collector to the Royal\r\nHorticultural Society of London, who when about to undertake a journey\r\nto New Granada in 1863, received instructions to visit the locality\r\nproducing Balsam of Tolu. After encountering considerable difficulties,\r\nMr. Weir succeeded in observing the manner of collecting the balsam in\r\nthe forest near Plato, on the right bank of the Magdalena. Mr. Weir’s\r\ninformation[794] may be thus summarized:—\r\n\r\nThe balsam tree has an average height of 70 feet with a straight trunk,\r\ngenerally rising to a height of 40 feet before it branches. The balsam\r\nis collected by cutting in the bark two deep sloping notches, meeting\r\nat their lower ends in a sharp angle. Below this =V=-shaped cut, the\r\nbark and wood is a little hollowed out, and a calabash of the size and\r\nshape of a deep tea-cup is fixed. This arrangement is repeated, so that\r\nas many as twenty calabashes may be seen on various parts of the same\r\ntrunk. When the lower part has been too much wounded to give space for\r\nany fresh incisions, a rude scaffold is sometimes erected, and a new\r\nseries of notches made higher up. The balsam-gatherer goes from time to\r\ntime round the trees with a pair of bags of hide, slung over the back\r\nof a donkey, and empties into them the contents of the calabashes. In\r\nthese bags the balsam is sent down to the ports where it is transferred\r\nto the cylindrical tins in which it reaches Europe. The bleeding of\r\nthe trees goes on for at least eight months of the year, causing them\r\nultimately to become much exhausted, and thin in foliage.\r\n\r\nIn some districts, as we learn from another traveller, it is customary\r\nto let the balsam flow down the trunk into a receptacle at its base,\r\nformed of the large leaf of a species of _Calathea_.\r\n\r\n[794] _Journ. of the R. Hort. Soc._, May 1864; _Pharm. Journ._ vi.\r\n(1865) 60.\r\n\r\nFrom the observations of Mr. Weir, it appears that the balsam tree is\r\nplentifully scattered throughout the Montaña around Plato and other\r\nsmall ports on the right bank of the Magdalena. He states that he saw\r\nat least 1,500 lb. of the drug on its way for exportation. From another\r\nsource, we know that it is largely collected in the valley of the\r\nSinu, and in the forests lying between that river and Cauca. None is\r\ncollected in Venezuela.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Balsam of Tolu freshly imported is a light brown,\r\nslow-flowing resin, soft enough to be impressible with the finger,\r\nbut viscid on the surface.[795] By keeping, it gradually hardens so\r\nas to be brittle in cold weather, but it is easily softened by the\r\nwarmth of the hand. Thin layers show it to be quite transparent and\r\nof a yellowish brown hue. It has a very agreeable and delicate odour,\r\nsuggestive of benzoin or vanilla, especially perceptible when the resin\r\nis warmed, or when its solution in spirit is allowed to evaporate\r\non paper. Its taste is slightly aromatic with a barely perceptible\r\nacidity, though its alcoholic solution decidedly reddens litmus.\r\n\r\nIn very old specimens, such as those which during the last century\r\nreached Europe in little calabashes[796] of the size and shape of an\r\norange, the balsam is brittle and pulverulent, and exhibits when broken\r\na sparkling, crystalline surface. This old balsam is of a fine deep\r\namber tint and superior fragrance.\r\n\r\nWhen Balsam of Tolu is pressed between two warmed plates of glass so\r\nas to obtain it in a thin even layer, and then examined with a lens,\r\nit exhibits an abundance of crystals of cinnamic acid. Balsam of Tolu\r\ndissolves easily and completely in glacial acetic acid, acetone,\r\nalcohol, chloroform or solution of caustic potash; it is less soluble\r\nin ether, scarcely at all in volatile oils, and not in benzol or\r\nbisulphide of carbon. The solution in acetone is devoid of rotatory\r\npower in polarized light.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The balsam consists partly of an _amorphous\r\nresin_, not soluble in bisulphide of carbon, which is supposed to be\r\nthe same as the dark resin precipitated by the bisulphide from balsam\r\nof Peru. Scharling (1856) assigned the formula C₁₈H₂₀O₅ to that part of\r\nthe balsam which is soluble in potash.\r\n\r\nIf Tolu balsam is boiled with water, it yields to it cinnamic and\r\nbenzoic acid, which we have (1877) perfectly succeeded in separating by\r\nrepeated recrystallization from water; we have before us good specimens\r\nof either, showing not only different melting points (133° C. and 121°\r\nC.), but as to our crystals of benzoïc acid, isolated from the balsam\r\nas stated above, we find that they also do _not_ evolve bitter almond\r\noil when mixed with sulphuric acid and chromate of potassium. The acids\r\nmay also be removed by boiling bisulphide of carbon.\r\n\r\nBusse[797] showed that _benzylic_ ethers of both benzoic and cinnamic\r\nacid are also constituents of the balsam, the cinnamate of benzyl being\r\npresent in larger quantity.\r\n\r\nUpon distilling the balsam with water, it affords 1 per cent. of\r\n_Tolene_, C₁₀H₁₆, boiling at about 170° C. This liquid rapidly absorbs\r\noxygen from the air. By destructive distillation, the balsam affords\r\nthe same substances as those obtainable from balsam of Peru, among\r\nwhich _Phenol_ and _Styrol_ have been observed.\r\n\r\n[795] I have seen it imported very fluid into London by way of New\r\nYork.—Sept. 1878.—F.

The quantity shipped from\r\nSanta Marta in 1870 was 2,002 lb.; in 1871, 2,183 lb.; in 1872, 1,206\r\nlb. In 1876 from the port of Savanilla 27,180 kilogrammes are stated to\r\nhave been exported.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Balsam of Tolu has no important medicinal properties. It is\r\nchiefly used as an ingredient in a pleasant-tasting syrup and in\r\nlozenges.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—We have twice met with spurious Balsam of Tolu, but in\r\nneither instance did the fraudulent drug bear any great resemblance to\r\nthe genuine.\r\n\r\nColophony, which might be mixed with the balsam, can be detected by\r\nwarm bisulphide of carbon which dissolves it, but removes from the pure\r\ndrug almost exclusively cinnamic and benzoic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALSAMUM PERUVIANUM.\r\n\r\n_Balsam umindicum nigrum_; _Balsam of Peru_; F. _Baume de Pérou, Baume\r\nde San Salvador_; G. _Perubalsam_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Myroxylon Pereiræ_ Klotzsch (_Myrospermum Pereiræ_\r\nRoyle), a tree attaining a height of about 50 feet, and throwing out\r\nspreading, ascending branches at 6 to 10 feet from the ground.[798]\r\n\r\nIt is found in a small district of the State of Salvador in Central\r\nAmerica (formerly part of Guatemala), lying between 13°·35 and 14°·10\r\nN. lat., and 89° and 89°·40 W. long., and known as the _Costa del\r\nBalsamo_ or Balsam Coast. The trees grow naturally in the dense\r\nforests; those from which the balsam is obtained are, if in groups,\r\nsometimes enclosed, in other cases only marked, but all have their\r\ndistinct owners. They are occasionally rented for a term of years, or a\r\ncontract is made for the produce of a certain number.\r\n\r\nThe principal towns and villages around which balsam is produced, are\r\nthe following:—Juisnagua, Tepecoyo or Coyo, Tamanique, Chiltiuapan,\r\nTalnique, Jicalapa, Teotepeque, Comasagua and Jayaque. All the lands on\r\nthe Balsam Coast are _Indian Reservation Lands_.\r\n\r\nThe Balsam of Peru tree was introduced in 1861 into Ceylon, where it\r\nflourishes with extraordinary vigour.\r\n\r\n[798] We are not yet prepared to accept the opinion of Baillon, that\r\n_M. Pereiræ_ is specifically identical with _M. Toluifera_, though we\r\nadmit they are very closely related. According to our observations, the\r\ntwo trees exhibit the following differences:—\r\n\r\n           _M. Toluifera._       |    _M.

In a chapter headed _Del Balsamo_,[799] he states that\r\nat the time he wrote (1565) the drug was not new, for that it had been\r\nreceived into medicine immediately after the discovery of New Spain. As\r\nthe conquest of Guatemala took place about 1524, we may conclude that\r\nthe balsam was introduced into Europe soon afterwards.\r\n\r\nMonardes further adds, that the balsam was in such high estimation\r\nthat it sold for 10 to 20 ducats (£4 10_s._ to £9) the ounce; and that\r\nwhen taken to Rome, it fetched even 100 ducats for the same quantity.\r\nThe inducement of such enormous prices brought plenty of the drug to\r\nEurope, and its value, as well as its reputation, was speedily reduced.\r\n\r\nThe description given by Monardes of extracting the balsam by boiling\r\nthe chopped wood of the trunk and branches, raises a doubt as to\r\nwhether the drug he had in view was exactly that now known; but he\r\nnever was in America, and may have been misinformed. Evidence that\r\nour drug was in use, is afforded by Diego Garcia de Palacio, who, in\r\nhis capacity of Auditor of the Royal Audiencia of Guatemala, wrote\r\nan account to Philip II., king of Spain, describing the geography\r\nand productions of this portion of his majesty’s dominions. In this\r\ninteresting document, which bears date 1576 and has only recently been\r\npublished,[800] Palacio tells the king of the great balsam trees of\r\nGuaymoco and of the coasts of Tonala,[801] and of the Indian method of\r\npromoting the exudation of the balsam by scorching the trunk of the\r\ntree. Prior to the conquest of the country by the Spaniards and for a\r\nshort time after, balsam formed part of the tribute paid to the Indian\r\nchiefs of Cuscatlan, to whom it was presented in curiously ornamented\r\nearthen jars.\r\n\r\nThe idea of great virtues attaching to the balsam is shown by the fact\r\nthat, in consequence of representations made by missionary priests in\r\nCentral America, Pope Pius V. granted a faculty to the Bishops of the\r\nIndies, permitting the substitution of the balsam of Guatemala for that\r\nof Egypt, in the preparation of the chrism used in the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch. This document, bearing date August 2, 1571, is still preserved\r\nin the archives of Guatemala.[802]\r\n\r\nIn the 16th century, the balsam tree grew in the warm regions of Panuco\r\nand Chiapan in Mexico, whence it was introduced into the famous gardens\r\nof Hoaxtepec near the city of Mexico, described by Cortes in his letter\r\nto Charles V. in 1552.[803]\r\n\r\nA rude figure of the tree, certainly a _Myroxylon_ and probably the\r\nspecies under notice, was published in the _Thesaurus Rerum Medicarum\r\nNovæ Hispaniæ_ of Hernandez,[804] who also says that it had been\r\ntransferred to the “Hoaxtepecences hortos” of the Mexican kings\r\n“delitiarum et magnificentiæ gratia.”\r\n\r\n[799] Occurring in the first book of the work quoted in the Appendix,\r\nwhich was published separately at Seville in 1565.\r\n\r\n[800] Squier, _Documents and Relations concerning the Discovery and\r\nConquest of America_, New York, 1859.—Frantzius, _San Salvador und\r\nHonduras im Jahre_ 1576.

This circumstance led to the balsam acquiring\r\nthe misleading name of _Peru_, and in part to the notion that it was a\r\nproduction of South America.\r\n\r\nThe history of Balsam of Peru was much amplified by a communication\r\nof the late Dr. Charles Dorat, of Sonsonate, Salvador, in 1860 to\r\nthe _American Journal of Pharmacy_, and by still further information\r\naccompanied by drawings and specimens, transmitted to one of us in\r\n1863.[805] These statements have lastly been confirmed again on the\r\nspot by Mr. Theophilus Wyss, a Swiss apothecary, established in San\r\nMiguel la Union, San Salvador.[806]\r\n\r\n=Extraction of the Balsam=—Early in November or December, or after the\r\nlast rains, the stems of the balsam trees are beaten with the back of\r\nan axe, a hammer or other blunt instrument, on four sides, a similar\r\nextent of bark being left unbruised between the parts that are beaten.\r\nThe bark thus injured soon cracks in long strips, and may be easily\r\npulled off. It is sticky as well as the surface below it, and there is\r\na slight exudation of fragrant resin, but not in sufficient quantity to\r\nbe worth collecting. To promote an abundant flow, it is customary, five\r\nor six days after the beating, to apply lighted torches or bundles of\r\nburning wood to the injured bark, whereby the latter becomes charred.\r\nAbout a week later, the bark either drops or is taken off, and the stem\r\ncommences to exude the balsam. This is collected by placing rags (of\r\nany kind or colour), so as entirely to cover the bare wood. As these\r\nrags in the course of some days become saturated with the exudation,\r\nthey are collected, thrown into an earthen vessel of water, and\r\ngently boiled and stirred until they appear nearly clean, the balsam\r\nseparating and sinking to the bottom. This process goes on for some\r\nhours, the exhausted rags being from time to time taken out, and fresh\r\nones thrown in. As the rags are removed they are wrung out in a sort\r\nof rope bag, and the balsam so saved is added to the stock. When the\r\nboiler has cooled, the water is decanted, and the balsam is poured into\r\n_tecomates_ or gourds, ready for the market.\r\n\r\nThe balsam prepared by means of rags is termed “balsamo de trapo;” a\r\nlittle balsam of inferior quality is also produced, according to Wyss,\r\nby boiling the bark with water. This method affords “Tacuasonte” or\r\n“balsamo de cascara,” which is sometimes mixed with the balsamo de\r\ntrapo. Tacuasonte means prepared without fire.\r\n\r\n[805] Hanbury in _Pharm. Journ._ v.

F.\r\n\r\nThe Indians work a tree a second year, by bruising the bark that was\r\nleft untouched the previous year. As the bark is said to be renewed in\r\nthe short space of two years, it is possible to obtain from the same\r\ntree an annual yield of about 2 lb. of balsam for many years, provided\r\na few years of rest be occasionally allowed. Clay or earth is sometimes\r\nsmeared over the bare wood.\r\n\r\nThe trees sometimes exude spontaneously a greenish gum-resin of\r\nslightly bitter taste, but totally devoid of balsamic odour. It has\r\nbeen analyzed by Attfield (see opposite page).\r\n\r\n=Secretion of the Balsam=—No observations have yet been made as to the\r\nsecretion of the balsam in the wood, or the part that is played by the\r\noperation of scorching the bark. Neither the unscorched bark nor the\r\nwood, as we have received them, possess any aromatic odour.\r\n\r\nThe old accounts speak of a very fragrant resin, far more valuable\r\nthan the ordinary balsam, obtained by incisions. We have made many\r\ninquiries for it, but without the least success. Such a resin is easily\r\nobtainable from the trunk of _M. Toluifera_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Balsam of Peru is a liquid having the appearance of\r\nmolasses, but rather less viscid. In bulk it appears black, but when\r\nexamined in a thin layer, it is seen to be of a deep orange-brown and\r\nperfectly transparent. It has a balsamic, rather smoky odour, which is\r\nfragrant and agreeable when the liquid is smeared on paper and warmed.\r\nIt does not much affect the palate, but leaves a disagreeable burning\r\nsensation in the fauces.\r\n\r\nThe balsam has a sp. gr. of 1·15 to 1·16. It may be exposed to the air\r\nfor years without undergoing alteration or depositing crystals. It is\r\nnot soluble in water, but yields to it a little cinnamic and traces of\r\nbenzoic acid; from 6 to 8 parts of crystallized carbonate of sodium are\r\nrequired to neutralize 100 parts of the balsam. It is but partially\r\nand to a small extent dissolved by dilute alcohol, benzol, ether or\r\nessential or fatty oils, not at all by petroleum ether. The balsam\r\nmixes readily with glacial acetic acid, anhydrous acetone, absolute\r\nalcohol or chloroform. Its rotatory power is very insignificant.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The peculiar process by which balsam of Peru is\r\nobtained, causes it to contain a variety of substances not found in\r\nthe more natural resin of _Myroxylon Toluifera_; hence the two drugs,\r\nthough derived from plants most closely allied, possess very different\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nThree parts of the balsam mix readily with one part of bisulphide of\r\ncarbon, yet a further addition of the latter will cause the separation\r\nof a brown flocculent resin. If the balsam be mixed with thrice\r\nits weight of bisulphide, a coherent mass of dark resin, sometimes\r\namounting to about 38 per cent. of the balsam, is precipitated. The\r\nbisulphide of carbon forms then a perfectly transparent brown liquid.\r\nIf this solution is shaken with water, the latter removes _Cinnamic_\r\nand _Benzoic_ acids. To separate them, ammonia is cautiously added,\r\nyet not in excess.[807] The solution of cinnamate and benzoate thus\r\nobtained and duly concentrated, yields both these acids in white\r\ncrystals on addition of acetic or hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n[807] By saturating the acid aqueous liquid with ammonia, it assumes a\r\ntransient bright yellow hue; an excess of ammonia transforms the whole\r\nmixture into an emulsion, from which the cinnameïn again separates but\r\nimperfectly.\r\n\r\nThe resin separated by means of bisulphide of carbon as above stated,\r\nis a black brittle amorphous mass, having no longer the specific odour\r\nof the balsam. It is soluble in caustic alkalis, also in alcohol; the\r\nsolution in the latter which may be considerably purified by charcoal,\r\nreddens litmus, and is abundantly precipitated by an alcoholic solution\r\nof neutral acetate of lead. Kachler (1869) by melting this resin with\r\npotash obtained about ⅔ of its weight of protocatechuic acid.[808] By\r\ndestructive distillation, it furnishes benzoic acid, styrol, C₈H₈, and\r\ntoluol, C₇H₈.\r\n\r\nAs to the solution obtained with bisulphide of carbon, it forms, after\r\nthe bisulphide has evaporated, a brownish aromatic liquid of about\r\n1·1 sp. gr., termed _Cinnameïn_. This substance may also be obtained\r\nby distillation, yet less easily, on account of its very high boiling\r\npoint, about 300° C.\r\n\r\nCinnameïn, C₁₆H₁₄O₂, is resolved by concentrated caustic lye into\r\nbenzylic alcohol, C₇H₁₄O₂, and cinnamic acid, C₉H₈O₂, whence it follows\r\nthat cinnameïn is _Benzylic Cinnamate_. This is, according to Kraut\r\n(1858, 1869, 1870) and to Kachler (1869, 1870), the chief constituent\r\nof the balsam. The former chemist obtained from it nearly 60 per cent.\r\ncinnameïn. Kachler assigns to the balsam the following composition: 46\r\nper cent. of cinnamic acid, 32 of resin, 20 of benzylic alcohol. These\r\nlatter figures however are not quite consistent: 46 parts of cinnamic\r\nacid (molecular weight = 148) would answer to 73 parts of benzylic\r\ncinnamate; and 20 parts of benzylic alcohol require on the other hand\r\nonly (mol. weight = 108) 27·4 parts of cinnamic acid in order to form\r\nbenzylic cinnamate (mol. = 238).\r\n\r\nBenzylic cinnamate, prepared as above stated, is a thick liquid,\r\nmiscible both with ether or alcohol, not concreting at -12° C., boiling\r\nat 305° C., yet under ordinary circumstances not without decomposition.\r\nBy exposure to air, it slowly acquires an acid reaction; by prolonged\r\naction of potash, especially in an alcoholic solution, toluol is\r\nalso formed. In this process, cinnamate of potassium finally forms a\r\ncrystalline mass, while an oily mixture of benzylic alcohol and toluol,\r\nthe so-called “_Peruvin_” constitutes the liquid part of the whole.\r\n\r\nGrimaux (1868) has artificially prepared benzylic cinnamate by heating\r\nan alkaline cinnamate with benzylic chloride. Thus obtained, that\r\nsubstance forms crystals, which melt at 39° C., and boil at 225 to 235°\r\nC. They consequently differ much from cinnameïn.\r\n\r\nDelafontaine (1868) is of the opinion, that cinnameïn contains besides\r\nbenzylic cinnamate, cinnamylic cinnamate, C₃₆H₃₂O₄, the same substance\r\nas described under the name of styracin in the article _Styrax\r\nliquida_. He states that he obtained benzylic and cinnamylic alcohol\r\nwhen he decomposed cinnameïn by an alkali. The two alcohols however\r\nwere separated only by fractional distillation.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding investigations it must be concluded, that the bark\r\nof the tree contains resin and probably benzylic cinnamate. The latter\r\nis no doubt altered by the process of collecting the balsam, which is\r\nfollowed on the Balsam Coast. To this are probably due the free acids\r\nin the balsam and its dark colour.\r\n\r\nAnother point of considerable interest is the fact, that the tree\r\nexudes a gum-resin, containing according to Attfield 77·4 per cent.\r\nof resin,[809] which is non-aromatic and devoid of cinnamic acid, and\r\ntherefore entirely distinct from balsam of Peru. The leaves of the tree\r\ncontain a fragrant oil.\r\n\r\n[808] Numerous resins as benzoin, guaiacum, dragon’s blood, myrrh,\r\netc., and many other substances are capable of affording the same acid.\r\n\r\n[809] _Pharm. Journ._ v. (1864) 248.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The balsam is shipped chiefly at Acajutla. It used formerly\r\nto be packed in large earthenware jars, said to be Spanish wine-jars,\r\nwhich, wrapped in straw, were sewed up in raw hide. These packages have\r\nof late been superseded by metallic drums, which have the advantage\r\nof being much less liable to breakage. We have no exact statistics as\r\nto the quantity exported from Central America. In the catalogue of\r\nSan Salvador (quoted above, page 207, note 2) p. 39, the value of the\r\nbalsam exported in 1876 from that country is stated to have been 78,189\r\ndollars. The value of tobacco amounted to 69,717 dollars, that of\r\ncoffee to 1⅓ millions of dollars, indigo to 2¼ millions.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Occasionally prescribed in the form of ointment as a stimulating\r\napplication to old sores, sometimes internally for the relief of asthma\r\nand chronic cough. It is said to be also employed for scenting soap.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—We have before us a sample of an adulterated balsam,\r\nwhich, we are told, is largely prepared at Bremen. It is less aromatic,\r\nless rich in acids, and contains usually much less than 38 per cent. of\r\nresin separable, as above stated, by means of bisulphide of carbon. At\r\nfirst sight however the adulterated drug is not so easily recognized.\r\n\r\nOther sorts of Balsam of Peru.\r\n\r\nThe value anciently set upon balsam for religions and medicinal uses,\r\nled to its being extracted from the pods and also from trees no longer\r\nemployed for the purpose; and many of the products so obtained have\r\nattracted the attention of pharmacologists.[810] Parkinson writing in\r\n1640 observes that—“there have been divers other sorts of liquours,\r\ncalled _Balsamum_ for their excellent vertues, brought out of the West\r\nIndies, every one of which for a time after their first bringing was of\r\ngreat account with all men and bought at great prices, but as greater\r\nstore was brought, so did the prices diminish and the use decay ...”\r\n\r\nIn Salvador, the name _Balsamo blanco_ (White Balsam) is applied to the\r\nsoft resin contained in the large ducts of the legume of _Myroxylon\r\nPereiræ_. This, when pressed out, forms a golden yellow, semi-fluid,\r\ngranular, crystalline mass, hardening by age, having a rather\r\nunpleasant odour suggestive of melilot. Stenhouse (1850) obtained from\r\nit the neutral resin _Myroxocarpin_, C₂₄H₃₄O₃, in thin colourless\r\nprisms, an inch or more in length. We have succeeded in extracting\r\nit directly from the pods. This White Balsam, which is distinctly\r\nmentioned in the letter of Palacio in 1576 (see p. 206), is a scarce\r\nand valuable article, never prepared for the market. A large jar of it\r\nwas sent to Pereira in 1850;[811] Guzman[812] and Wyss state that it is\r\nknown in the country as “Balsamito,” or “Balsamo _catolico_ or Virgin\r\nBalsam.”\r\n\r\n[810] Guibourt, _Hist. des Drog._ iii.

(1851) 286.\r\n\r\n[812] In the Catalogue alluded to, page 207, note 2.\r\n\r\nA fragrant balsamic resin is collected, though in but very small\r\nquantity, from _Myroxylon peruiferum_ Linn. f., a noble tree of New\r\nGranada, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. A fine sample of this\r\nsubstance, accompanied by herbarium and other specimens, was presented\r\nto one of us (H.) by Mr. J. Correa de Méllo of Campinas (Brazil); it is\r\na resin having a general resemblance to Balsam of Tolu, but of somewhat\r\ndeeper and redder tint, and greater hardness. Pressed between two slips\r\nof warmed glass, it does not exhibit any crystals.\r\n\r\nIn a treatise on Brazil written by a Portuguese friar about\r\n1570-1600,[813] mention is made of the “_Cabueriba_” (_Cabure-iba_),\r\nfrom which a much-esteemed balsam was obtained by making incisions in\r\nthe stem, and absorbing the exudation with cotton wool, somewhat in the\r\nsame way as Balsam of Peru is now collected in Salvador. This tree is\r\n_Myrocarpus frondosus_ Allem., now called _Cabriuva preta_. The genus\r\nis closely allied to _Myroxylon_.\r\n\r\nAnother fragrant oleo-resin, which has doubtless been confounded with\r\nthat of a _Myroxylon_, is obtained in Central America from _Liquidambar\r\nstyraciflua_ L., either by incision or by boiling the bark.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEN BONDUCELLÆ.\r\n\r\n_Semen Guilandinæ_; _Bonduc Seeds_, _Grey Nicker Seeds or Nuts_; F.\r\n_Graines de Bonduc ou du Cniquier_, _Pois Quéniques_, _Pois Guénic_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Cæsalpinia Bonducella_ Roxb. (_Guilandina\r\nBonducella_ L.), a prickly, pubescent, climbing shrub[814] of wide\r\ndistribution, occurring in Tropical Asia, Africa and America,\r\nespecially near the sea. The compressed, ovate, spiny legume is 2 to 3\r\ninches long, and contains one or two, occasionally three or four, hard,\r\ngrey, globular seeds.\r\n\r\nThe plant is often confounded with _C. Bonduc_ Roxb., a nearly allied\r\nbut much rarer species, distinguished by being nearly glabrous, having\r\nleaflets very unequal at the base, no stipules, erect bracts, and\r\nyellow seeds.\r\n\r\n=History=—“_Pūti-Karanja_” stinking Karanja, in Susruta (I.223,\r\n1) is the plant under notice. The word _Bunduk_, occurring in the\r\nwritings of the Arabian and Persian physicians, also in Constantinus\r\nAfricanus, mostly signifies _hazel-nut_.[815] One of these authors, Ibn\r\nBaytar,[816] who flourished in the 13th century, further distinguished\r\na drug called _Bunduk Hindi_ (Indian hazel-nut), giving a description\r\nwhich indicates it plainly as the seed under notice. Both _Bunduk_\r\nand _Bunduk Hindi_ are enumerated in the list of drugs of Noureddeen\r\nMohammed Abdullah Shirāzy,[817] physician to the Mogul emperor Shah\r\nJehan, A.D. 1628-1661.\r\n\r\nThe pods of _C. Bonducella_ were figured by Clusius in 1605, under\r\nthe name of _Lobus echinodes_, and the plant both by Rheede[818] and\r\nRumphius. Piso and Marcgraf (1648) noticed it in Brazil and gave some\r\naccount of it with a bad woodcut, under the designation of _Inimbóy_\r\n(now _Inimboja_), or in Portuguese _Silva do Praya_.\r\n\r\n[813] Purchas, _His Pilgrimes_, iv.

They are of a bluish or greenish grey tint, smooth, yet marked\r\nby slightly elevated horizontal lines of a darker hue. The umbilicus\r\nis surrounded by a small, dark brown, semilunar blotch opposite the\r\nmicropyle. The hard shell is from ¹/₂₅ to ²/₂₅ of an inch thick, and\r\ncontains a white kernel; representing from 40 to 50 per cent. of the\r\nweight of the seed. It separates easily from the shell, and consists of\r\nthe two cotyledons and a stout radicle. When a seed is soaked for some\r\nhours in cold water, a very thin layer can be peeled from the surface\r\nof the testa. The kernel is bitter, but with the taste that is common\r\nto most seeds of the family _Leguminosæ_.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The outer layer of the testa, the epidermis\r\nabove alluded to, is composed of two zones of perpendicular, closely\r\npacked cells, the outer measuring about 130 mkm., the inner 100 mkm. in\r\nlength and only 5 to 7 mkm. in diameter. The walls of these cylindrical\r\ncells are thickened by secondary deposits, which in transverse section\r\nshow usually four or more channels running down nearly perpendicularly\r\nthrough the whole cell.\r\n\r\nThe spongy parenchyme, which is covered by this very distinct outer\r\nlayer, is made up of irregular, ovate, subglobular or somewhat\r\nelongated cells with large spaces between them, loaded with brown\r\nmasses of tannic matter, assuming a blackish hue when touched with\r\nperchloride of iron. The thick walls of these cells frequently exhibit,\r\nchiefly in the inner layers, undulated outlines. The tissue of the\r\ncotyledons is composed of very large cells, swelling considerably in\r\nwater, and containing some mucilage (as may be ascertained when thin\r\nslices are examined in oil), small starch granules, fatty oil, and a\r\nlittle albuminous matter.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—According to the medical reports alluded to in\r\nthe _Pharmacopœia of India_ (1868), Bonduc seeds, and still more the\r\nroot of the plant, act as a powerful antiperiodic and tonic.\r\n\r\nThe active principle has not yet been adequately examined. It may\r\nperhaps occur in larger proportion in the bark of the root, which\r\nis said to be more efficacious than the seeds in the treatment of\r\nintermittent fever.[819]\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the chemical nature of the principle of the\r\nseeds, one ounce of the kernels[820] was powdered and exhausted with\r\nslightly acidulated alcohol. The solution after the evaporation of the\r\nalcohol was made alkaline with caustic potash, which did not produce a\r\nprecipitate. Ether now shaken with the liquid, completely removed the\r\nbitter matter, and yielded it in the form of an amorphous white powder,\r\ndevoid of alkaline properties. It is sparingly soluble in water, but\r\nreadily in alcohol, forming intensely bitter solutions; an aqueous\r\nsolution is not precipitated by tannic acid. It produces a yellowish\r\nor brownish solution with concentrated sulphuric acid, which acquires\r\nsubsequently a violent hue. Nitric acid is without manifest influence.\r\nFrom these experiments, we may infer that the active principle of the\r\nBonduc seed is a bitter substance not possessing basic properties.\r\n\r\n[819] Waring, _Bazaar Medicines_, Travancore, 1860. 18.\r\n\r\n[820] Kindly furnished us by Dr. Waring.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The powdered kernels either _per se_, or mixed with black pepper\r\n(_Pulvis Bonducellæ compositus_ Ph. Ind.), are employed in India\r\nagainst intermittent fevers and as a general tonic.\r\n\r\nThe fatty oil of the seeds is sometimes extracted and used in India; it\r\nwas shown at the Madras Exhibitions of 1855 and 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGNUM HÆMATOXYLI.\r\n\r\n_Lignum Campechianum v. Campescanum_; _Logwood_, _Peachwood_; F. _Bois\r\nde Campèche_, _Bois d’Inde_; G. _Campecheholz_, _Blauholz_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Hæmatoxylon campechianum_ L., a spreading tree[821]\r\nof moderate size, seldom exceeding 40 feet in height, native of the\r\nbay of Campeachy, Honduras and other parts of Central America. It\r\nwas introduced into Jamaica by Dr. Barham[822] in 1715, and is now\r\ncompletely naturalized in that and other of the West Indian Islands.\r\n\r\n=History=—Hernan Cortes in his letter to the Emperor Charles V., giving\r\nan account of his expedition to Honduras in 1525,[823] refers to the\r\nIndian towns of Xiculango and Tabasco as carrying on a trade in cacao,\r\ncotton cloth, and _colours for dyeing_,—in which last phrase there may\r\nbe an allusion to logwood. We have sought for some more definite notice\r\nof the wood in the _Historia de las Indias_ of Oviedo,[824] the first\r\nchronicler of America, but without much success.\r\n\r\nYet the wood must have been introduced into England in the latter\r\nhalf of the 16th century, for, in 1581, an Act of Parliament[825]\r\nwas passed, abolishing its use and ordering that any found should be\r\nforfeited and burned. In this Act the obnoxious dye is described as “a\r\ncertain kind of ware or stuff called _Logwood_ alias _Blockwood_ ... of\r\nlate years ... brought into this realm of England.” The object of this\r\nmeasure was to protect the public against the bad work of the dyers,\r\nwho, it seems, were unable at that period to obtain durable colours by\r\nthe use of logwood. Eighty years later the art of dyeing had so far\r\nimproved that logwood was again permitted,[826] the colours produced by\r\nit being declared as lasting and serviceable as those made by any other\r\nsort of dyewood whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe wood is mentioned by De Laet (1633) as deriving its name from the\r\ntown of Campeachy, whence, says he, it is brought in great plenty to\r\nEurope.[827]\r\n\r\n[821] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med.

By exposure to air and moisture, the wood acquires externally\r\na blackish-red colour; internally it remains brownish red. It splits\r\nwell, although of a rather dense and tough texture.\r\n\r\nThe transverse section of a piece of logwood exhibits to the naked eye\r\na series of very narrow concentric zones, formed by comparatively large\r\npores, and of small parenchymatous circles separated by the larger and\r\ndarker rings of the proper woody tissue. The numerous medullary rays\r\nare visible only by means of a lens. The wood has a pleasant odour.\r\n\r\nFor use in pharmacy, logwood is always purchased in the form of chips,\r\nwhich are produced by the aid of powerful machinery. The chips have a\r\nfeeble, seaweed-like odour, and a slightly sweet, astringent taste,\r\nbetter perceived in a watery decoction than by chewing the dry wood,\r\nwhich however quickly imparts to the saliva its brilliant colour.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—Under a high magnifying power, the concentric\r\nzones are seen to run not quite regularly round the centre, but in a\r\nsomewhat undulating manner, because they do not correspond, as in our\r\nindigenous woods, to regular periods of annual growth. The vascular\r\nbundles contain only a few vessels, and are transversely united by\r\nsmall lighter parenchymatous bands. The latter are made up of large,\r\ncubic, elongated or polygonal cells, each loaded with a crystal of\r\noxalate of calcium. The large punctuated vessels having frequently\r\n150 mkm. diameter, are surrounded by this woody parenchyme, while\r\nthe prevailing tissue of the wood is composed of densely packed\r\nprosenchyme, consisting of long cylindrical cells (_libriform_) with\r\nthick, dark red-brown walls having small pores.\r\n\r\nThe medullary rays are of the usual structural character, running\r\ntransversely in one to three straight rows; in a longitudinal\r\nsection, the single rays show from 4 to 40 rows succeeding each other\r\nperpendicularly. No regular arrangement of the rays is obvious in a\r\nlongitudinal section made in a tangential direction. The colouring\r\nmatter is chiefly contained in the walls of the ligneous tissue and the\r\nvessels, and sometimes occurs in crystals of a greenish hue within the\r\nlatter, or in clefts of the wood.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Logwood was submitted to analysis by Chevreul as\r\nearly as the year 1810,[828] since which period all contributions to\r\na knowledge of the drug refer exclusively to its colouring principle\r\n_Hæmatoxylin_, which Chevreul obtained in a crystallized state and\r\ncalled _Hématine_. The very interesting properties of this substance\r\nhave been chiefly examined by Erdmann (1842) and by O. Hesse (1858-59).\r\n\r\n[828] _Annals de Chimie_, lxxxi. (1812) 128.\r\n\r\nErdmann obtained from logwood 9 to 12 per cent. of crystallized\r\nhæmatoxylin, which he showed to have the formula C₁₆H₁₄O₆. In a pure\r\nstate it is colourless, crystallizing with 1 or with 3 equivalents\r\nof water, and is readily soluble in hot water or in alcohol, but\r\nsparingly in cold water or in ether. It has a persistent sweet taste\r\nlike liquorice. The crystals of hæmatoxylin acquire a red colour by\r\nthe action of sunlight, as likewise their aqueous solution. They are\r\ndecomposed by ozone but not by pure and dry oxygen. In presence of\r\nalkalis, hæmatoxylin exposed to the air quickly yields dark purplish\r\nviolet solutions, which soon acquire a yellowish or dingy brownish\r\ncolour; hence in analytical chemistry hæmatoxylin is used as a test for\r\nalkalis.\r\n\r\nBy the combined action of ammonia and oxygen, dark violet crystalline\r\nscales of _Hæmateïn_, C₁₆H₁₄O₆ + 3 OH₂, are produced.[829] They show a\r\nfine green hue, which is also very commonly observable on the surface\r\nof the logwood chips of commerce. Hæmateïn may again be transformed\r\ninto hæmatoxylin by means of hydrogen or of sulphurous acid.\r\n\r\nHæmatoxylin separates protoxide of copper from an alkaline solution\r\nof the tartrate, and deviates the ray of polarized light to the right\r\nhand. It is not decomposed by concentrated hydrochloric acid; by\r\nmelting hæmatoxylin with potash, pyrogallol (pyrogallic acid, C₆H₆O₃)\r\nis obtained. Alum and the salts of lead throw down precipitates from\r\nsolutions of hæmatoxylin, the latter being of a bluish-black colour.\r\nLogwood affords upon incineration 3·3 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\nThe colouring matter being abundantly soluble in boiling water, an\r\n_Extract of Logwood_ is also prepared on a large scale. It occurs in\r\ncommerce in the form of a blackish brittle mass, taking the form of\r\nthe wooden chest into which it is put while soft. The extract shares\r\nthe chemical properties of hæmatoxylin and hæmateïn: whether it also\r\ncontains gum requires investigation.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—The felling and shipping of logwood in\r\nCentral America have been described by Morelet,[830] who states that in\r\nthe woods of Tabasco and Yucatan the trade is carried on in the most\r\nirrational and reckless manner. By advancing money to the natives, or\r\nby furnishing them with spirits, arms, or tools, the proprietors of\r\nthe woods engage them to fell a number of trees in proportion to their\r\ndebts. This is done in the dry season, the rainy period being taken\r\nfor the shipment of the logs, which are conveyed chiefly to the island\r\nof Carmen in the Laguna de Terminos in South-western Yucatan, and to\r\nFrontera on the mouths of the Tabasco river, at which places European\r\nships receive cargoes of the wood.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 the export of Laguna de Terminos amounted to 528,605 quintals\r\n(one quintal = 46 kilogrammes), that from Port-au-Prince, Hayti, in\r\n1872, nearly to 90,000 tons.\r\n\r\nFour sorts of logwood are found in the London market, namely\r\n_Campeachy_, quoted[831] at £8 10_s._ to £9 10_s._ per ton; _Honduras_,\r\n£6 10_s._ to £6 15_s._; _St. Domingo_, £5 15_s._ to £6; _Jamaica_,\r\n£5 2_s._ 6_d._ to £5 10_s._ The imports into the United Kingdom were\r\nvalued in 1872 at £233,035. The quantities imported during that and the\r\nprevious three years were as follows:—\r\n\r\n        1869         1870          1871         1872\r\n    50,458 tons.  62,187 tons.  39,346 tons.  46,039 tons.\r\n\r\n[829] Benedikt, in 1875, assigned them the formula C₄₈H₃₉O₁₈N + 9 OH₂.\r\n\r\n[830] _Voyage dans l’Amérique centrale, l’île de Cuba et le Yucatan_,\r\nParis, 1857.\r\n\r\n[831] _Public Ledger_, 28 Feb. 1874.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the import was 64,215 tons, valued at £415,857. The largest\r\nquantity is supplied by the British West India Islands. Hamburg also\r\nimports annually about 20,000 tons of logwood.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Logwood in the form of decoction is occasionally administered\r\nin chronic diarrhœa, and especially in the diarrhœa of children. Cases\r\nhave occurred in which its use has been followed by phlebitis. Its\r\nemployment in the art of dyeing is far more important.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The woods of several species of _Cæsalpinia_ imported\r\nunder the name of _Brazil Wood_ and used for dyeing red, bear an\r\nexternal resemblance to logwood, with which it is said they are\r\nsometimes mixed in the form of chips. They contain a crystallizable\r\ncolouring principle called _Brasilin_, C₂₂H₂₀O₇, or, according to\r\nLiebermann and Burg (1876), C₁₆H₁₄O₅, which affords with alkalis _red_\r\nand not bluish or purplish solutions, and yields trinitrophenol,\r\nC₆H₂(NO₂) 3OH (picric acid), when boiled with nitric acid, while\r\nhæmatoxylin yields oxalic acid only. The best source for brasilin is\r\nthe wood of _Cæsalpinia Sappan_ L., a tree of the East Indies, well\r\nknown as _Bakam_, _Brazil Wood_, _Lignum Brasile_, _Verzino_ of the\r\nItalians, an important object of commerce during the middle ages.[832]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLIA SENNÆ.\r\n\r\n_Senna Leaves_; F. _Feuilles de Séné_; G. _Sennesblätter_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—The Senna Leaves of commerce are afforded by two\r\nspecies of _Cassia_[833] belonging to that section of the genus which\r\nis distinguished by having leaves without glands, axillary racemes\r\nelongating as inflorescence advances, membranaceous bracts which in the\r\nyoung raceme conceal the flower buds but drop off during flowering, and\r\na short, broad, flat legume.\r\n\r\nThe senna plants are low perennial bushy shrubs, 2 to 4 feet high,\r\nhaving pari-pinnate leaves with leaflets unequal at the base, and\r\nyellow flowers. The pods contain 6 or more seeds in each, suspended\r\non alternate valves by long capillary funicles. These run towards the\r\npointed end of the seed, but are curved at their attachment to the\r\nhilum just below. The seeds are compressed and of an obovate-cuneate or\r\noblong form, beaked at the narrower end.[834]\r\n\r\nThe species in question are the following:—\r\n\r\n1. _Cassia acutifolia_ Delile[835]—a shrub about 2 feet high, with\r\npale subterate or obtusely angled, erect or ascending branches,\r\noccasionally slightly zigzag above, glabrous at least below. Leaves\r\nusually 4-5-jugate; leaflets oval or lanceolate, acute, mucronate,\r\nusually more or less distinctly puberulous or at length glabrous,\r\npale or subglaucous at least beneath, subsessile. Stipules subulate,\r\nspreading or reflexed, 1-2 lines long. Racemes axilliary, erect, rather\r\nlaxly many-flowered, usually considerably exceeding the subtending\r\nleaf. Bracts membranous, ovate or obovate, caducous. Pedicels at length\r\n2-3 lines. Sepals obtuse, membranous. Two of the anterior anthers much\r\nexceeding the rest of the fertile stamens. Legume flat, very broadly\r\noblong, but slightly curved upwards, obliquely stipitate, broadly\r\nrounded at the extremity with a minute or obsolete mucro indicating the\r\nposition of the style on the upper edge; 1½-2¼ inches long, ¾-1 inch\r\nbroad; valves chartaceous, obsoletely or thinly puberulous, faintly\r\ntransverse-veined, unappendaged. Seeds obovate-cuneate, compressed;\r\ncotyledons plane, extending the large diameter of the seed in\r\ntransverse section.[836]\r\n\r\n[832] See Yule, _Marco Polo_, ii. (1874). 369.\r\n\r\n[833] Some writers have removed these plants from _Cassia_ to a\r\nseparate genus named _Senna_, but such subdivision is repudiated by the\r\nprincipal botanists. The intricate synonymy of the senna plants has\r\nbeen well worked out by J. B. Batka in his memoir entitled _Monographie\r\nder Cassien-Gruppe Senna_ (Prag, 1866), of which we have made free\r\nuse. We have also had the advantage of the recent _Revision of the\r\nGenus Cassia_ by Bentham (_Linn. Trans._, xxvii. 1871. 503) and of\r\nthe labours of Oliver on the same subject in his _Flora of Tropical\r\nAfrica_, ii. (1871) 268-282.\r\n\r\n[834] On the structure of the seed, see Batka, _Pharm.

Linn.; _C. lanceolata_ Nectoux; _C.\r\nlenitiva_ Bisch.; _Senna acutifolia_ Batka.\r\n\r\n[836] We borrow the above description from Prof. Oliver.\r\n\r\nThe plant is a native of many districts of Nubia (as Sukkot, Mahas,\r\nDongola, Berber), Kordofan and Sennaar; grows also in Timbuktu and\r\nSokoto, and is the source of _Alexandrian Senna_.\r\n\r\n2. _C. angustifolia_ Vahl[837]—This species is closely related to the\r\npreceding, the general description of which is applicable to it with\r\nthe following exceptions. In the present plant the leaflets, which are\r\nusually 5-8-jugate, are narrower, being oval-lanceolate, tapering from\r\nthe middle towards the apex; they are larger, being from one to nearly\r\n2 inches long, and are either quite glabrous or furnished with a very\r\nscanty pubescence. The legume is narrower (7-8 lines broad), with the\r\nbase of the style distinctly prominent on its upper edge.\r\n\r\nThe plant abounds in Yemen and Hadramaut in Southern Arabia; it is also\r\nfound on the Somali coast, in Sind and the Punjab. In some parts of\r\nIndia it is now cultivated for medicinal use.\r\n\r\nThe uncultivated plant of Arabia supplies the so-called _Bombay Senna_\r\nof commerce, the true _Senna Mekki_ of the East. The cultivated and\r\nmore luxuriant plant, raised originally from Arabian seeds, furnishes\r\nthe _Tinnevelly Senna_ of the drug market.\r\n\r\n=History=—According to the elaborate researches of Carl Martius,[838] a\r\nknowledge of senna cannot be traced back earlier than the time of the\r\nElder Serapion, who flourished in the 9th or 1Oth century; and it is\r\nin fact to the Arabian physicians that the introduction of the drug to\r\nWestern Europe is due. Isaac Judæus,[839] who wrote probably about A.D.\r\n850-900 and who was a native of Egypt, mentions senna, the best kind of\r\nwhich he says is that brought from Mecca.\r\n\r\nSenna (as _Ssinen_ or _Ssenen_) is enumerated among the commodities\r\nliable to duty at Acre in Palestine at the close of the 12th\r\ncentury.[840] In France in 1542, a pound of senna was valued in an\r\nofficial tariff[841] at 15 sols, the same price as pepper or ginger.\r\n\r\nThe Arabian and the mediæval physicians of Europe used both the pods\r\nand leaves, preferring however the former. The pods (_Folliculi Sennæ_)\r\nare still employed in some countries.\r\n\r\n[837] _Synonyms_—_C. lanceolata_ Roxb.; _C. elongata_ Lem.

Hence the term _Italian Senna_ used by\r\nGerarde and others. In the records of the “Cinque savii alla mercanzia”\r\nat Venice we found an order bearing date 1526 to the effect that Senna\r\nleaves of Tuscany were inadmissible; the same was applied in 1676 to\r\nthe drug from Tripoli in Barbaria, that from Cairo being exclusively\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\n=Production=—According to Nectoux,[843] whose observations relate to\r\nNubia at the close of the last century, the peasants make two senna\r\nharvests annually, the first and more abundant being at the termination\r\nof the rains,—that is in September; while the other, which in dry\r\nseasons is almost _nil_, takes place in April.\r\n\r\nThe gathering consists in simply cutting down the shrubs, and exposing\r\nthem on the rocks to the burning sun till completely dry. The drug is\r\nthen packed in bags made of palm leaves holding about a quintal each,\r\nand conveyed by camels to Es-souan and Darao, whence it is transported\r\nby water to Cairo. By many travellers it is stated that _Senna jebeli_,\r\ni.e. _mountain senna_ (_C. acutifolia_), finds its way to the ports of\r\nMassowhah and Suakin, and thence to Cairo and Alexandria.\r\n\r\n_Cassia obovata_, which is called by the Arabs _Senna baladi_, i.e.\r\n_indigenous_ or _wild senna_, grows in the fields of durra (_Sorghum_)\r\nat Karnak and Luxor, and in the time of Nectoux was held in such small\r\nesteem that it fetched but a quarter the price of the _Senna jebeli_\r\nbrought by the caravans of Nubia and the Bisharrin Arabs. It is not now\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Three kinds of senna are distinguished in English\r\ncommerce:—\r\n\r\n1. _Alexandrian Senna_—This is furnished by _Cassia acutifolia_ and\r\nis imported in large bales. It used formerly always to arrive in a\r\nvery mixed and dirty state, containing, in addition to leaflets of\r\nsenna, a variable proportion of leafstalks and broken twigs, pods and\r\nflowers; besides which there was almost invariably an accompaniment of\r\nthe leaves, flowers and fruits of _Solenostemma Argel_ Hayne (p. 220),\r\nnot to mention seeds, stones, dust and heterogeneous rubbish. Such a\r\ndrug required sifting, fanning and picking, by which most of these\r\nimpurities could be separated, leaving only the senna contaminated with\r\nleaves of argel. But Alexandrian Senna has of late been shipped of much\r\nbetter quality. Some we have recently seen (1872) was, as taken from\r\nthe original package, wholly composed of leaflets of _C. acutifolia_ in\r\na well-preserved condition; and even the lower qualities of senna are\r\nnever now contaminated with argel to the extent that was usual a few\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n[842] It is a glaucous shrub with obovate leaflets, broadly rounded and\r\nmucronulate, reniform legume terminated by persistent style, and marked\r\nalong the middle of each valve by a series of crest-shaped ridges\r\ncorresponding to the seeds. It is more widely distributed in the Nile\r\nregion than the other species, and is also found in Sindh and Gujerat\r\nand (naturalized) in the West Indies. Its leaflets (also pods) may\r\noccasionally be picked out of Alexandrian Senna.\r\n\r\n[843] _Voyage dans la Haute Egypte ... avec des observations sur les\r\ndiverses espèces de Séné qui sont répandues dans le commerce_, Paris,\r\n1808. fol.\r\n\r\nThe leaflets, the general form of which has already been described (p.\r\n216), are ¾ to 1¼ inches long, rather stiff and brittle, generally a\r\nlittle incurled at the edges, conspicuously veined, the midrib being\r\noften brown. They are covered with a very short and fine pubescence\r\nwhich is most dense on the midrib. The leaves have a peculiar opaque,\r\nlight yellowish green hue, a somewhat agreeable tea-like odour, and\r\na mucilaginous, not very marked taste, which however is sickly and\r\nnauseous in a watery infusion.\r\n\r\n2. _Arabian Moka, Bombay or East Indian Senna_—This drug is derived\r\nfrom _Cassia angustifolia_, and is produced in Southern Arabia. It is\r\nshipped from Moka, Aden and other Red Sea ports to Bombay, and thence\r\nreaches Europe.\r\n\r\nArabian senna is usually collected and dried without care, and is\r\nmostly an inferior commodity, fetching in London sometimes as low a\r\nprice as ½_d._ to ¼_d._ per lb. Yet so far as we have observed, it is\r\nnever adulterated, but consists wholly of senna leaflets, often brown\r\nand decayed, mixed with flowers, pods, and stalks. The leaflets have\r\nthe form already described (p. 217); short adpressed hairs are often\r\nvisible on their under surface.\r\n\r\n3. _Tinnevelly Senna_—Derived from the same species as the last, but\r\nfrom the plant cultivated in India, and in a state of far greater\r\nluxuriance than it exhibits in the drier regions of Arabia where\r\nit grows wild. It is a very superior and carefully collected drug,\r\nconsisting wholly of the leaflets. These are lanceolate, 1 to 2 inches\r\nin length, of a yellowish green on the upper side, of a duller tint on\r\nthe under, glabrous or thinly pubescent on the under side with short\r\nadpressed hairs. The leaflets are less rigid in texture than those of\r\nAlexandrian senna, and have a tea-like, rather fragrant smell, with but\r\nlittle taste.\r\n\r\nTinnevelly senna has of late fallen off in size, and some importations\r\nin 1873 were not distinguishable from Arabian senna, except from having\r\nbeen more carefully prepared. The drug is generally shipped from\r\nTuticorin in the extreme south of India.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The analysis of senna with a view to the\r\nisolation of its active principle has engaged the attention of numerous\r\nchemists, but as yet the results of their labours are not quite\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nLudwig (1864) treated an alcoholic extract of senna with charcoal,\r\nand obtained from the latter by means of boiling alcohol two bitter\r\nprinciples, _Sennacrol_, soluble in ether, and _Sennapicrin_, not\r\ndissolved by ether.\r\n\r\nDragendorff and Kubly (1866) have shown the active substance of senna\r\nto be a colloid body, easily soluble in water but not in strong\r\nalcohol. When a syrupy aqueous extract of senna is mixed with an equal\r\nvolume of alcohol, and the mucilage thus thrown down has been removed,\r\nthe addition of a further quantity of alcohol occasions the fall of\r\na dark brown, almost tasteless, easily alterable substance, which\r\nis indued with purgative properties. It was further shown that this\r\nprecipitate was a mixture of calcium and magnesium salts of phosphoric\r\nacid and a peculiar acid. The last named, separated by hydrochloric\r\nacid, has been called _Cathartic Acid_; it is a black substance which\r\nin the mouth is at first insipid, but afterwards tastes acid and\r\nsomewhat astringent. In water or strong alcohol it is almost insoluble,\r\nand entirely so in ether or chloroform; but it dissolves in warm dilute\r\nalcohol. From this solution it is precipitable by many acids, but not\r\nby tannic.\r\n\r\nGroves[844] in 1868, unaware of the researches of Dragendorff and\r\nKubly, arrived at similar results as these chemists, and proved\r\nconclusively that a cathartate of ammonia possesses in a concentrated\r\nform the purgative activity of the original drug.\r\n\r\nThe exactness of the chief facts relative to the solubility in\r\nweak alcohol of the active principle of senna set forth by the\r\nsaid chemists, was also remarkably supported by the long practical\r\nexperience of T. and H. Smith of Edinburgh.[845]\r\n\r\nWhen cathartic acid is boiled with alcohol and hydrochloric acid, it is\r\nresolved into sugar and _Cathartogenic Acid_.\r\n\r\nThe alcoholic solution from which the cathartates have been separated\r\ncontains a yellow colouring matter which was called _Chrysoretin_ by\r\nBley and Diesel (1849), but identified as _Chrysophan_[846] by Martius,\r\nBatka and others. Dragendorff and Kubly regard the identity of the two\r\nsubstances as doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe same alcoholic solution which contains the yellow colouring matter\r\njust described, also holds dissolved a sugar which has been named\r\n_Catharto-mannite_. It forms warty crystals, is not susceptible of\r\nalcoholic fermentation, and does not reduce alkaline cupric tartrate.\r\nThe formula assigned to it is C₄₂H₄₄O₃₈.\r\n\r\nSenna contains tartaric and oxalic acids with traces of malic acid.\r\nThe large amount of ash, 9 to 12 per cent., consisting of earthy and\r\nalkaline carbonates, also indicates the presence of a considerable\r\nquantity of organic acids.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Alexandrian Senna, the produce of Nubia and the regions\r\nfurther south, was formerly a monopoly of the Egyptian Government,\r\nthe enjoyment of which was granted to individuals in return for a\r\nstipulated payment: hence it was known in continental trade as _Séné de\r\nla palte_, while the depots were termed _paltes_ and those who farmed\r\nthe monopoly _paltiers_.[847] All this has long been abolished, and the\r\ntrade is now free, the drug being shipped from Alexandria.\r\n\r\nArabian senna is brought into commerce by way of Bombay. The quantity\r\nof senna imported thither from the Red Sea and Aden in the year 1871-72\r\nwas 4,195 cwt., and the quantity exported during the same period, 2,180\r\ncwt.[848]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Senna leaves are extensively employed in medicine as a purgative.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The principal contamination to which senna is at present\r\nliable arises from the presence of the leaves of _Solenostemma Argel_\r\nHayne, a plant of the order _Asclepiadeæ_, 2 to 3 feet high, growing in\r\nthe arid valleys of Nubia. Whether these leaves are used for the direct\r\npurpose of adulteration, or under the notion of _improving_ the drug,\r\nor in virtue of some custom or prejudice, is not very evident. It is\r\ncertain however that druggists have been found who _preferred_ senna\r\nthat contained a good percentage of argel.\r\n\r\n[844] _Pharm. Journ._ x. (1869) 196.\r\n\r\n[845] _Ibid._ 315.\r\n\r\n[846] See Art. _Radix Rhei_.\r\n\r\n[847] From Italian _appaltare_, to let or farm.\r\n\r\n[848] _Statement of the Trade and Navigation of the Presidency of\r\nBombay for_ 1871-72, pt. ii. 21. 98.\r\n\r\nNectoux, to whom we owe the first exact account of the argel or hárgel\r\nplant,[849] describes it as never gathered with the senna by accident\r\nor carelessness, but always separately. In fact he saw, both at Esneh\r\nand Phile, the original bales of argel as well as those of senna: and\r\nat Boulak near Cairo, at the beginning of the present century, the\r\nargel used to be regularly mixed with senna in the proportion of one to\r\nfour.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of argel after a little practice are very easily recognized;\r\nbut their complete separation from senna by hand-picking is a tedious\r\noperation. They are lanceolate, equal at the base, of the same size as\r\nsenna leaflets but often larger, of a pallid, opaque, greyish-green,\r\nrigid, thick, rather crumpled, wrinkled and pubescent, not distinctly\r\nveined. They have an unmistakeably bitter taste. The small, white,\r\nstar-like flowers, or more often the flower buds, in dense corymbs\r\nare found in plenty in the bales of Alexandrian senna. The slender,\r\npear-shaped follicles, when mature 1½ inches long, with comose seeds\r\nare less frequent. It has been shown by Christison[850] that argel\r\nleaves administered _per se_ have but a feeble purgative action, though\r\nthey occasion griping. It is plain therefore that their admixture with\r\nsenna should be deprecated.\r\n\r\nThe leaves or leaflets of several other plants were formerly mixed\r\noccasionally with senna, as those of the poisonous _Coriaria\r\nmyrtifolia_ L., a Mediterranean shrub, of _Colutea arborescens_ L., a\r\nnative of Central and Southern Europe, and of the Egyptian _Tephrosia\r\nApollinea_ Delile. We have never met with any of them.[851]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS CASSIÆ FISTULÆ.\r\n\r\n_Cassia Fistula_; _Purging Cassia_; F. _Casse Canefice_, _Fruit du\r\nCaneficer_; G. _Röhrencassie_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Cassia Fistula_ L. (_Cathartocarpus Fistula_\r\nPers., _Bactyrilobium Fistula_ Willd.) a tree indigenous to India,\r\nascending to 4000 feet in the outer Himalaya, but now cultivated or\r\nsubspontaneous in Egypt, Tropical Africa,[852] the West Indies and\r\nBrazil. It is from 20 to 30 feet high (in Jamaica even 50 feet) and\r\nbears long pendulous racemes of beautiful fragrant, yellow flowers.\r\nSome botanists have established for this tree and its near allies a\r\nseparate genus, on account of its elongated, cylindrical indehiscent\r\nlegume, but by most it is retained in the genus _Cassia_.\r\n\r\n[849] _Op. cit._ (See p. 218).\r\n\r\n[850] _Dispensatory_, ed. 2. 1848. 850.\r\n\r\n[851] The reader will find figures of these leaves contrasted with\r\nSenna in Pereira’s _Elem. of Mat. Med._ ii. part ii (1853) 1866.\r\n\r\n[852] Schweinfurth found it in 6° N. lat. and 28-29° E. long., in the\r\ncountry of the Dor, where the tree may also be indigenous.\r\n\r\n=History=—The name _Casia_ or _Cassia_ was originally applied\r\nexclusively to a bark related to cinnamon which, when rolled into a\r\ntube or pipe, was distinguished in Greek by the word σῦριγζ, and in\r\nLatin by that of _fistula_. Thus Scribonius Largus,[853] a physician\r\nof Rome during the reigns of Tiberius and Claudius, with the latter of\r\nwhom he is said to have visited Britain, A.D. 43, uses the expression\r\n“_Casiæ rufæ fistularum_” in the receipt for a collyrium. Galen[854]\r\ndescribing the different varieties of cassia, mentions that called\r\n_Gizi_[855] (γίζεις) as being quite like cinnamon or even better; and\r\nalso names a well-known cheaper sort, having a strong taste and odour\r\nwhich is called _fistula_, because it is rolled up like a tube.\r\n\r\nOribasius, physician to the Emperor Julian in the latter half of the\r\n4th and beginning of the 5th century, describes _Cassia fistula_ as\r\na _bark_ of which there are several varieties, having pungent and\r\nastringent properties (“_omnes cassiæ fistulæ vires habent acriter\r\nexalfacientes et stringentes_”), and sometimes used in the place of\r\ncinnamon.[856]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless the same drug which is spoken of by Alexander\r\nTrallianus[857] as Κασίας σῦριγζ (_casia fistula_) in connexion with\r\ncostus, pepper and other aromatics; and named by other Greek writers as\r\nΚασία συριγγώδης (_casia fistularis_). Alexander still more distinctly\r\ncalls it also Κασία αἰγυπτία.[858]\r\n\r\nThe tree under examination and its fruit were exactly described in the\r\nbeginning of the 13th century by Abul Abbâs Annâbatî of Sevilla;[859]\r\nthe fruit, the Cassia Fistula of modern medicine, is noticed by Joannes\r\nActuarius, who flourished at Constantinople towards the close of the\r\n13th century; and as he describes it with particular minuteness,[860]\r\nit is evident that he did not consider it well known. The drug is also\r\nmentioned by several writers of the school of Salernum. The tree would\r\nappear to have found at an early period its way to America, if we are\r\ncorrect in referring to it the Cassia Fistula enumerated by Petrus\r\nMartyr among the valuable products of the New World.[861] The drug was\r\na familiar remedy in England in the time of Turner, 1568.[862]\r\n\r\nThe tree was figured in 1553 by the celebrated traveller Belon who met\r\nwith it in the gardens of Cairo, and in 1592 by Prosper Alpinus who\r\nalso saw it in Egypt.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The ovary of the flower is one-celled with numerous\r\novules, which as they advance towards maturity become separated by\r\nthe growth of intervening septa. The ripe legume is cylindrical, dark\r\nchocolate-brown, 1½ to 2 feet long by ¾ to 1 inch in diameter, with\r\na strong short woody stalk, and a blunt end suddenly contracted into\r\na point. The fibro-vascular column of the stalk is divided into two\r\nbroad parallel seams, the dorsal and ventral sutures, running down\r\nthe whole length of the pod, The sutures are smooth, or slightly\r\nstriated longitudinally; one of them is formed of two ligneous bundles\r\ncoalescing by a narrow line. If the legume is curved, the ventral\r\nsuture commonly occupies its inner or concave side. The valves of the\r\npods are marked by slight transverse depressions (more evident in\r\nsmall specimens) corresponding to the internal divisions, and also by\r\ninconspicuous transverse veins.\r\n\r\n[853] _Compositiones Medicamentorum_, cap. 4. sec. 36.\r\n\r\n[854] _De Antidot._ i. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[855] Noticed likewise among the commodities liable to duty at\r\nAlexandria in the 2nd century.—Vincent, _Commerce of the Ancients_, ii.\r\n712.\r\n\r\n[856] _Physica Hildegardis_, Argent. 1533. 227.\r\n\r\n[857] Libri xii.

The oval, flattish seed\r\nfrom ³/₁₀ to ⁴/₁₀ of an inch long, of a reddish-brown colour, contains\r\na large embryo whose yellowish veined cotyledons cross diagonally, as\r\nseen on transverse section, the horny white albumen. One side is marked\r\nby a dark line (the raphe). A very slender funicle attaches the seed to\r\nthe ventral suture.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the seeds, the cells contain a soft saccharine pulp\r\nwhich in the recent state fills them up, but in the imported pods\r\nappears only as a thin layer, spread over the septum, of a dark viscid\r\nsubstance of mawkish sweet taste. It is this pulp which is made use of\r\nin pharmacy.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The bands above described running along the\r\nwhole pod, are made up of strong fibro-vascular bundles mixed with\r\nsclerenchymatous tissue. The valves consist of parenchymatous cells,\r\nand the whole pod is coated with an epidermis exhibiting small tabular\r\ncells, which are filled with dark granules of tannic matter. A few\r\nstomata are also met with. The thin brittle septa of the pod are\r\ncomposed of long ligneous cells, enclosing here and there crystals of\r\noxalate of calcium.\r\n\r\nThe pulp itself, examined under water, is seen to consist of loose\r\ncells, not forming a coherent tissue. They enclose chiefly granules of\r\nalbuminoid matters and stellate crystals of oxalate of calcium. The\r\ncell-wall assumes, on addition of iodine, a blue hue if they have been\r\npreviously washed by potash lye. The seeds are devoid of starch, but\r\nyield a copious amount of thick mucilage, which surrounds them like a\r\nhalo if they are macerated in water.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—No peculiar principle is known to exist either\r\nin the woody or the pulpy portion of cassia fistula. The pulp contains\r\nsugar in addition to the commonly occurring bodies noticed in the\r\nprevious section.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The pulp separated from the woody part of the pods by crushing\r\nthe latter, digesting them in hot water, and evaporating the strained\r\nliquor, is a mild laxative in common domestic use in the South of\r\nEurope,[863] but in England scarcely ever now administered except in\r\nthe form of the well-known _Lenitive Electuary_ (_Confectio sennæ_) of\r\nwhich it is an ingredient.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Cassia fistula is shipped to England from the East and\r\nWest Indies, but chiefly from the latter. The pulp _per se_ has been\r\noccasionally imported, but it should never be employed when the legumes\r\nfor preparing it can be obtained.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—The pods of some other species of _Cassia_ share the\r\nstructure above described and have been sometimes imported.\r\n\r\n[863] Thus there were imported into Leghorn in 1871, 103 tons of\r\n_Cassia Fistula_ and Tamarinds.—_Consular Reports_, 1873, part i.\r\n\r\nThose of _C. grandis_ L. f. (_C. brasiliana_ Lamarck), a tree of\r\nCentral America and Brazil, are of much larger size, showing when\r\nbroken transversely an elliptic outline, whose longer diameter exceeds\r\nan inch. The valves have very prominent sutures and transverse\r\nbranching veins. The pulp is bitter and astringent.\r\n\r\nThe legumes of _Cassia moschata_ H B K.,[864] a tree 30 to 40 feet\r\nhigh, growing in New Granada and known there as _Cañafistola de\r\npurgar_, bear a close resemblance to those of _Cassia Fistula_ L.,\r\nexcept that they are a little smaller and rather less regularly\r\nstraight. They contain a sweetish astringent pulp of a bright brown\r\nhue. When crushed and exposed to the heat of a water-bath, they emit\r\na pleasant odour like sandal-wood. The pulp is coloured dark blackish\r\ngreen by perchloride of iron.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAMARINDI PULPA.\r\n\r\n_Tamarindus_, _Fructus Tamarindi_; _Tamarinds_; F. _Tamarins_; G.\r\n_Tamarinden_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Tamarindus indica_ L.—The tamarind is a large\r\nhandsome tree, growing to a height of 60 to 80 feet, and having\r\nabruptly pinnate leaves of 10 to 20 pairs of small oblong leaflets,\r\nconstituting an abundant and umbrageous foliage. Its purplish flower\r\nbuds and fragrant, red-veined, white blossoms, ultimately assuming a\r\nyellowish tinge, contribute to its beautiful aspect and cause it to be\r\ngenerally cultivated in tropical countries.\r\n\r\n_T. indica_ appears to be truly indigenous to Tropical Africa between\r\n12° N. and 18° S. lat. It grows not only in the Upper Nile regions\r\n(Sennaar, Kordofan, Abyssinia), but also in some of the remotest\r\ndistricts visited by Speke, Grant, Kirk, and Stanley, and as far south\r\nas the Zambesi. According to F. von Müller,[865] it occurs in Tropical\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nIt is found throughout India, and as it has Sanskrit names it may even\r\nbe really wild in at least the southern parts of the peninsula. It\r\ngrows in the Indian islands, and Crawfurd[866] has adduced reasons to\r\nshow that it is probably a true native of Java. The mediæval Arabian\r\nauthors describe it as growing in Yemen, India, and Nigritia.\r\n\r\nThe tamarind has been naturalized in Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico.\r\nHernandez,[867] who resided in the latter country from 1571 to 1575,\r\nspeaks of it as “_nuper ... ad eas oras translata_.” It abounds in\r\nthe West Indies where it was also introduced together with ginger by\r\nthe Spaniards at an early period. The tree found in these islands\r\nbears shorter and fewer-seeded pods than that of India, and hence was\r\nformerly regarded as a distinct species, _Tamarindus occidentalis_\r\nGärtn.\r\n\r\n[864] Hanbury in _Linn.

Under this name it\r\nwas mentioned by Isaac Judæus,[871] Avicenna,[872] and the Younger\r\nMesue,[873] and also by Alhervi,[874] a Persian physician of the 10th\r\ncentury who describes it as black, of the flavour of a Damascene plum,\r\nand containing fibres and stones.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless from the Arabians that a knowledge of the tamarind,\r\nas of so many other eastern drugs, passed during the middle ages into\r\nEurope through the famous school of Salernum. _Oxyphœnica_ (Ὀζυϕοίνικα)\r\nand _Dactyli acetosi_ are names under which we meet with it in the\r\nwritings of Matthæus Platearius and Saladinus, the latter of whom, as\r\nwell as other authors of the period, considered tamarinds as the fruit\r\nof a wild palm growing in India.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of tamarinds in Malabar, Coromandel, and Java was\r\nreported to Manuel, king of Portugal, in the letter of the apothecary\r\nPyres[875] on the drugs of India, written in Cochin, January 27th,\r\n1516. A correct description of the tree was given by Garcia de Orta\r\nabout fifty years later.\r\n\r\n=Preparation=—Tamarinds undergo a certain preparation before being\r\nbrought into commerce.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies, the tree matures its fruit in June, July and\r\nAugust, and the pods are gathered when fully ripe, which is known by\r\nthe fragility of the outer shell. This latter, which easily breaks\r\nbetween the finger and thumb, is then removed, and the pods deprived\r\nof shelly fragments are placed in layers in a cask, and boiling syrup\r\nis poured over them till the cask is filled. When cool, the cask is\r\nclosed and is then ready for sale. Sometimes layers of sugar are placed\r\nbetween the fruits previous to the hot syrup being added.[876]\r\n\r\nEast Indian tamarinds are also sometimes preserved with sugar, but\r\nusually they are exported without such addition, the outer shell being\r\nremoved and the fruits being pressed together into a mass.\r\n\r\n[868] Sir Gardner Wilkinson (_Ancient Egyptians_, i. 1841, 78) says\r\nthat tamarind stones have been found in the tombs of Thebes; but on\r\nconsulting Dr. Birch and the collections in the British Museum we have\r\nobtained no confirmation of the fact.\r\n\r\n[869] Barth speaks of it as _an invaluable gift of Providence_: _Reisen\r\nund Entdeckungen in Nord-und Centralafrica_, Gotha, 1858. i. 614; iii.\r\n334. 400; iv. 173.—The same says Rohlfs, _Reisen durch Nordafrica_,\r\nGotha (1872) 23.\r\n\r\n[870] _Susrutas Ayurvedas_, ed.

They are of firm consistence and quite black, externally strewn\r\nwith hair, sand, seeds and other impurities; they are largely consumed\r\nin Egypt and Central Africa, and sometimes find their way to the south\r\nof Europe as _Egyptian Tamarinds_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit is an oblong, or linear-oblong, strictly\r\ncompressed, curved or nearly straight, pendulous legume, of the\r\nthickness of the finger and 3 to 6 inches in length, supported by a\r\nwoody stalk. It has a thin but hard and brittle outer shell or epicarp,\r\nwhich does not split into valves or exhibit any very evident sutures.\r\nWithin the epicarp is a firm, juicy pulp, on the surface of which and\r\nstarting from the stalk are strong woody ramifying nerves; one of these\r\nextends along the dorsal (or concave) edge, two others on either side\r\nof the ventral (or convex) edge, while between these two there are\r\nusually 2, 3, or 4 less regular and more slender nerves,—all running\r\ntowards the apex and throwing out branching filaments. The brownish or\r\nreddish pulp has usually an acid taste, though there are also sweetish\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nThe seeds, 4 to 12 in number, are each of them enclosed in a tough,\r\nmembraneous cell (endocarp), surrounded by the pulp (sarcocarp). They\r\nare flattened and of irregular outline, being roundish, ovate, or\r\nobtusely four-sided, about ⁶/₁₀ of an inch long by ³/₁₀ thick, with the\r\nedge broadly keeled or more often slightly furrowed. The testa is of\r\na rich brown, marked on the flat sides of the seed by a large scar or\r\noreole, of rather duller polish than the surrounding portion which is\r\nsomewhat radially striated. The seed is exalbuminous, with thick hard\r\ncotyledons, a short straight included radicle, and a plumule in which\r\nthe pinnation of the leaves is easily perceptible.\r\n\r\nTamarinds are usually distinguished in trade as _West Indian_ and _East\r\nIndian_, the former being preserved with sugar, the latter without.\r\n\r\n1. _West Indian Tamarinds_, _Brown or Red Tamarinds._—A bright\r\nreddish-brown, moist, saccharine mass consisting of the pulpy internal\r\npart of the fruit, usually unbroken, mixed with more or less of syrup.\r\nIt has a very agreeable and refreshing taste, the natural acidity of\r\nthe pulp being tempered by the sugar. It is this form of tamarinds that\r\nis usually found in the shops.\r\n\r\n2. _East Indian Tamarinds_, _Black Tamarinds._—These differ from the\r\nlast described in that they are preserved without the use of sugar.\r\nThey are found in the market in the form of a firm, clammy, black mass,\r\nconsisting of the pulp mixed with the seeds, stringy fibres, and some\r\nremains of the outer shell. The pulp has a strong acid taste.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the rather uninviting appearance of East Indian\r\ntamarinds, they afford a good pulp, which may be satisfactorily used\r\nin making the _Confectio Sennæ_ of pharmacy. In fact, on the continent\r\nthis sort of tamarind alone is employed for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The soft part of tamarind consists of a tissue\r\nof thin-walled cells of considerable size, which is traversed by long\r\nfibro-vascular bundles. In the former a few very small starch granules\r\nare met with, and more numerous crystals, which are probably bitartrate\r\nof potassium.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Water extracts from unsweetened tamarinds,\r\nsugar together with acetic, tartaric and citric acids, the acids\r\nbeing combined for the most part with potash. The neutralized\r\nsolution reduces alkaline cupric tartrate after a while without heat,\r\nand therefore probably contains grape sugar. On evaporation, cream\r\nof tartar and sugar crystallize out. The volatile acids of the fatty\r\nseries, the presence of which in the pulp has been pointed out by\r\nGorup-Besanez, have not been met with by other chemists. Tannin is\r\nabsent as well as oxalic acid. We have ascertained that in East Indian\r\ntamarinds, citric acid is present in but small quantity. No peculiar\r\nprinciple to which the laxative action of tamarinds can be attributed\r\nis known.\r\n\r\nThe fruit-pulp diffused in water forms a thick, tremulous, somewhat\r\nglutinous and turbid liquid. It was examined as early as the year 1790\r\nby Vauquelin under the name of “_vegetable jelly_,”—the first described\r\namong the pectic class of bodies.\r\n\r\nThe hard _seeds_ have a testa which abounds in tannin, and after long\r\nboiling is easily separated, leaving the cotyledons soft. These latter\r\nhave a bland mucilaginous taste, and are consumed in India as food\r\nduring times of scarcity.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Tamarinds are shipped in comparatively small quantities from\r\nseveral of the West Indian islands, and also from Guayaquil.\r\n\r\nThe export from the Bombay Presidency in the year 1871-72 was 6286\r\ncwt., which quantity was shipped chiefly to the Persian Gulf, Sind, and\r\nports of the Red Sea.[877] 128,144 centners were re-exported in 1877\r\nfrom Trieste.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—In medicine, tamarinds are considered to be a mild laxative;\r\nthey are sometimes used to make a refrigerant drink in fever. In hot\r\ncountries, especially the interior of Africa, they are regarded as of\r\nthe highest value for the preparation of refreshing beverages. The\r\n_Black Tamarinds_ are said to be used in the manufacture of tobacco.\r\n\r\n[877] _Statement of the Trade and Navigation of the Presidency of\r\nBombay_, 1871-72, pt. ii. 65.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALSAMUM COPAIBA.\r\n\r\n_Copaiba_; _Balsam of Copaiba or Copaiva_, _Balsam Capivi_; F. _Baume\r\nou Oléo-résine de Copahu_; G. _Copaivabalsam_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—The drug under notice is produced by trees belonging\r\nto the genus _Copaifera_, natives of the warmer countries of South\r\nAmerica. Some are found in moist forests, others exclusively in dry\r\nand elevated situations. They vary in height and size, some being\r\numbrageous forest trees, while others have only the dimension of\r\nshrubs; it is from the former alone that the oleo-resin is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe following are reputed to furnish the drug, but to what extent each\r\ncontributes is not fully known.\r\n\r\n1. _Copaifera officinalis_ L. (_C. Jacquini_ Desf.), a large tree\r\nof the hot coast region of New Granada as far north as Panama, of\r\nVenezuela and the island of Trinidad.\r\n\r\n2. _C. guianensis_ Desf., a tree of 30 to 40 feet high, very closely\r\nrelated to the preceding, native of Surinam, Cayenne, also of the Rio\r\nNegro between Manaos and Barcellos (Spruce). According to Bentham it\r\nseems to be the same species as the _C. bijuga_ of Hayne.[878]\r\n\r\n3. _C. coriacea_ Mart. (_C. cordifolia_ Hayne), a large tree found in\r\nthe _caatingas_ or dry woods of the Brazilian provinces of Bahia and\r\nPiauhy.\r\n\r\n4. _C. Langsdorffii_ Desf.[879] (_C. nitida_ Hayne, _C. Sellowii_\r\nHayne,? _C. Jussieui_ Hayne), a polymorphous species, varying in the\r\nform and size of leaflets, and also in dimensions, being either a\r\nshrub, a small bushy tree, or a large tree of 60 feet high. Bentham\r\nadmits, besides the type, three varieties:—β. _glabra_ (_C. glabra_\r\nVogel), γ. _grandifolia_, δ. _laxa_ (_C. laxa_ Hayne). The tree grows\r\non dry _campos_, _caatingas_ and other places in the provinces of\r\nS. Paulo, Minas Geraes, Goyaz, Mato Grosso, Bahia and Ceará; it is\r\ntherefore distributed over a vast area. According to Gardner,[880] the\r\nBrazilian traveller, it yields an abundance of balsam.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these species, must be mentioned a tree described by\r\nHayne and commonly cited under the name of _Copaifera multijuga_, as a\r\nspecial source of the drug shipped from Pará.[881] As its name implies,\r\nit is remarkable for the number of leaflets (6 to 10 pairs) on each\r\nleaf. But it is only known from some leaves in the herbarium of Martius\r\nwhich Bentham, who has examined them, informs us are unlike those\r\nof any _Copaifera_ known to him, though certainly the leaflets are\r\ndotted with oil-vessels as in some species. In the absence of flowers\r\nand fruits, there is no sufficient evidence to prove that it belongs\r\neven to the genus _Copaifera_. It is not mentioned by Martius in his\r\n_Systema Materiæ Medicæ Brasiliensis_ (1843) as a source of the drug.\r\n\r\n=History=—Among the early notices of Brazil is a treatise by a\r\nPortuguese friar who had resided in that country from 1570 to 1600.\r\nThe manuscript found its way to England, was translated, and was\r\npublished by Purchas[882] in 1625. Its author notices many of the\r\nnatural productions of the country, and among others _Cupayba_ which\r\nhe describes as a large tree from whose trunk, when wounded by a deep\r\nincision, there flows in abundance a clear oil much esteemed as a\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nBalsam. _Copæ. yvæ_ is already enumerated in the 6th edition of the\r\nPharmacopœa of Amsterdam, A.D. 1636.[883]\r\n\r\nFather Cristoval d’Acuña,[884] who ascended the Amazon from Pará,\r\narriving at Quito in 1638, mentions that the country affords very\r\nlarge Cassia fistula, excellent sarsaparilla, and the oils of Andirova\r\n(_Carapa guianensis_ Aublet, _Meliaceæ_), and _Copaiba_, as good as\r\nbalsam for curing wounds.\r\n\r\nPiso and Marcgraf,[885] who in 1636 accompanied the Count of Nassau\r\nto the Dutch establishments in Brazil, each give an account of the\r\n_Copaiba_ and the method of obtaining its oleo-resin. The former states\r\nthat the tree grows in Pernambuco and the island of Maranhon, whence\r\nthe balsam is conveyed in abundance to Europe.\r\n\r\n[878] Hayne (1827) enumerated and figured 15 species, some of\r\nthem founded on very imperfect materials. Bentham in the _Flora\r\nBrasiliensis_ of Martius and Endlicher (fasc. 50, _Leguminosæ_, ii.\r\n1870. pp. 239-244) admits only 11, one of which is doubtful as to the\r\ngenus.\r\n\r\n[879] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med.

He is of the opinion that the cell-walls of the neighbouring\r\nparenchyme are liquefied and transformed into the oleo-resin.[887] We\r\nare not able to offer any argument in favour of this opinion.\r\n\r\nIn the vessels already alluded to, the balsam sometimes collects in\r\nso large a quantity, that the trunk is unable to sustain the inward\r\npressure, and _bursts_. This curious phenomenon is thus referred to\r\nin a letter addressed to one of us by Mr. Spruce:—“I have three or\r\nfour times heard what the Indians assured me was the bursting of an\r\nold capivi-tree, distended with oil. It is one of the strange sounds\r\nthat sometimes disturb the vast solitudes of a South American forest.\r\nIt resembles the boom of a distant cannon, and is quite distinct\r\nfrom the crash of an old tree falling from decay which one hears not\r\nunfrequently.”\r\n\r\nA similar phenomenon is known in Borneo. The trunks of aged trees of\r\n_Dryobalanops aromatica_ contain large quantities of oleo-resin or\r\nCamphor Oil,[888] which appears to be sometimes secreted under such\r\npressure that the vast trunk gives way. “There is another sound,” says\r\nSpenser St. John,[889] “only heard in the oldest forests, and that is\r\nas if a mighty tree were rent in twain. I often asked the cause, and\r\nwas assured it was the camphor tree splitting asunder on account of the\r\naccumulation of camphor in some particular portion.”\r\n\r\n=Extraction=—Balsam Capivi is collected by the Indians on the banks\r\nof the Orinoco and its upper affluents, and carried to Ciudad Bolivar\r\n(Angostura); some of this balsam reaches Europe by way of Trinidad. But\r\nit is obtained much more largely on the tributaries of the Caisquiari\r\nand Rio Negro (the Siapa, Içanna, Uaupés, etc.) and is sent down to\r\nPará. Most of the northern tributaries of the Amazon, as the Trombetas\r\nand Nhamundá, likewise furnish a supply. According to Spruce, in\r\nthe Amazon valley it is the tall virgin forest, _Caaguaçú_ of the\r\nBrazilians, _Monte Alto_ of the Venezuelans, that yields most of the\r\noils and gum-resins, and not the low, dry _caatingas_, or the riparial\r\nforests. The same observant traveller tells us that in Southern\r\nVenezuela, capivi is known only as _el Aceite de palo_ (_wood-oil_),\r\nthe name _Balsamo_ being that of the so-called _Sassafras Oil_,\r\nobtained from a species of _Nectandra_.\r\n\r\n[886] Valmont de Bomare, _Dict. d’Hist.

Its trunk was clear of\r\nbranches to a height of at least 90 feet. The collector commenced the\r\nwork by hewing out with his axe a hole or chamber in the trunk about\r\na foot square, at a height of two feet from the ground. The base or\r\nfloor of the chamber should be carefully and neatly cut with a gentle\r\nupward slope, and it should also decline to one side, so that the\r\nbalsam on issuing may run in a body until it reaches the outer edge.\r\nBelow the chamber a pointed piece of bark is cut and raised, which,\r\nenveloped with a leaf, serves as a spout for conveying the balsam from\r\nthe tree to the tin.[892] The balsam, continues Cross, came flowing in\r\na moderate sized cool current, full of air bubbles. At times the flow\r\nstopped for several minutes, when a singular gurgling noise was heard,\r\nafter which followed a rush of balsam. When coming most abundantly a\r\npint jug would have been filled in the space of one minute. The whole\r\nof the wood cut through by the axeman was bedewed with drops of balsam;\r\nthe bark is apparently devoid of it. Trees of the largest size in\r\ngood condition will sometimes yield four “potos,” equal to 84 English\r\nimperial pints.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Copaiba is more or less viscid fluid, varying in tint\r\nfrom a pale yellow to a light golden brown, of a peculiar aromatic,\r\nnot unpleasant odour, and a persistent, acrid, bitterish taste. Pará\r\ncopaiba newly imported is sometimes nearly colourless and almost as\r\nfluid as water.[893] The balsam is usually quite transparent, but\r\nthere are varieties which remain always opalescent. Its sp. gr. varies\r\nfrom 0·940 to 0·993, according as the drug contains a greater or less\r\nproportion of volatile oil. Copaiba becomes more fluid by heat; if\r\nheated in a test tube to 200° C. for some time, it does not lose its\r\nfluidity on cooling. It is sometimes slightly fluorescent, it dissolves\r\nin several times its weight of alcohol 0·830 sp. gr., and generally in\r\nall proportions in absolute alcohol,[894] acetone, or bisulphide of\r\ncarbon, and is perfectly soluble in an equal volume of benzol. Glacial\r\nacetic acid readily dissolves the resin but not the essential oil.\r\n\r\nCopaiba that is rich in resin of an acid character, unites with the\r\noxides of baryum, calcium, or magnesium, to form a gradually hardening\r\nmass, provided a small proportion of water is present. Thus 8 to 16\r\nparts of balsam will combine as a stiff compound when gently warmed\r\nwith 1 part of moistened magnesia; and still more easily with lime or\r\nbaryta.\r\n\r\n[890] _Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Erdkunde zu Berlin_, v. (1870)\r\n435.\r\n\r\n[891] Report to the Under Secretary of State for India, on the\r\ninvestigation and collecting of plants and seeds of the india-rubber\r\ntrees of Pará and Ceara, and Balsam of Copaiba. March 1877,—8.\r\n\r\n[892] See figure in the above Report.\r\n\r\n[893] We saw such as this which had been imported into London in 1873;\r\nthough regarded by the dealers with suspicion, we are not of opinion\r\nthat it was sophisticated.\r\n\r\n[894] Such is the case with some very authentic specimens collected\r\nfor one of us in Central America by De Warszewicz, but other samples\r\nwhich we had up reason to suppose adulterated, left a certain amount of\r\nwhite residue when treated with _twice their weight_ of alcohol sp. gr.\r\n0·796.\r\n\r\nBuignet has first shown (1861) that copaiba varies in its optical\r\npower. A sample from Trinidad examined by one of us was strongly\r\ndextrogyre, and also several samples imported in 1877 from Maturin\r\n(near Aragua, Venezuela), and Maracaibo into Hamburg, whereas we found\r\nPará balsam to be levogyre.[895]\r\n\r\nThe Pará and Maranham balsams are regarded in wholesale trade as\r\ndistinct sorts, and experienced druggists are able to distinguish\r\nthem apart by odour and appearance, and especially by the greater\r\nconsistence of the Maranham drug. Maracaibo balsam is reckoned as\r\nanother variety, but is now rarely seen in the English market. West\r\nIndian copaiba is usually said to be of inferior quality, but except\r\nthat it is generally opalescent, we know not on what precise grounds.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The balsam is a solution of resin in volatile\r\noil; the latter constitutes about 40 to 60 per cent. of the\r\nbalsam,[896] according to the age of the latter and its botanical\r\norigin. The oil has the composition C₁₅H₂₄; its boiling point is 245°\r\nC. or even higher. It smells and tastes like the balsam, and dissolves\r\nin from 8 to 30 parts of alcohol 0·830 sp. gr. The oil exhibits several\r\nmodifications differing in optical as well as in other physical\r\nproperties, but numerous samples of the drug, either _dextrogyre_ or\r\nlevogyre, invariably afforded us essential oils deviating to the left;\r\ntheir sp. gr. varies from about 0·88 to 0·91.\r\n\r\nAfter the oil of copaiba has been removed by distillation, there\r\nremains a brittle amorphous resin of an acid character soluble both in\r\nbenzol and amylic alcohol, and yielding only amorphous salts. Sometimes\r\ncopaiba contains a small amount of crystallizable resin-acid, as\r\nfirst pointed out in 1829 by Schweitzer. By exposing a mixture of 9\r\nparts of copaiba and two parts of aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0·95) to a\r\ntemperature of-10° C., Schweitzer obtained crystals of the acid resin\r\ntermed _Copaivic Acid_. They were analysed in 1834 by H. Rose, and\r\nexactly measured and figured by G. Rose. Hess (1839) showed that Rose’s\r\nand his own analyses assign to copaivic acid the formula C₂₀H₃₂O₂. It\r\nagrees with Maly’s abietic acid from colophony in composition, but not\r\nin any other way. Copaivic acid is readily soluble in alcohol, and\r\nespecially in warmed copaiba itself; much less in ether. We have before\r\nus crystals, no doubt of copaivic acid, which have been spontaneously\r\ndeposited in an authentic specimen of the oleo-resin of _Copaifera\r\nofficinalis_ from Trinidad, which we have kept for many years. The\r\ncrystals may be easily dissolved by warming the balsam; on cooling the\r\nliquid, they again make their appearance after the lapse of some weeks.\r\nAfter recrystallization from alcohol they fuse at 116-117 C°., forming\r\nan amorphous transparent mass which quickly crystallizes if touched\r\nwith alcohol.\r\n\r\nAn analogous substance, _Oxycopaivic Acid_, C₂₀H₂₈O₃, was examined in\r\n1841 by H. von Fehling, who met with it as a deposit in Pará Copaiba.\r\nAnd lastly Strauss (1865) extracted _Metacopaivic Acid_, C₂₂H₃₄O₄, from\r\nthe balsam imported from Maracaibo. He boiled the latter with soda-lye,\r\nwhich separated the oil; the heavier adjacent liquid was then mixed\r\nwith chloride of ammonium, which threw down the salts of the amorphous\r\nresin-acid, leaving in solution those of the metacopaivic acid. The\r\nlatter acid was separated by hydrochloric acid and recrystallization\r\nfrom alcohol. We succeeded in obtaining metacopaivic acid by washing\r\nthe balsam with a dilute solution of carbonate of ammonium, and\r\nprecipitating by hydrochloric acid. The precipitate dissolved in dilute\r\nalcohol yields the acid in small crystals, but to the amount of only\r\nabout one per cent.\r\n\r\n[895] Flückiger in Wiggers and Husemann’s _Jahresbericht_ for 1867.\r\n162, and for 1868. 140.\r\n\r\n[896] Or 18 to 65 per cent., sp. gr. 0·915 to 0·995, according to\r\nSiebold (1877).\r\n\r\nThese resin-acids have a bitterish taste and an acid reaction; their\r\nsalts of lead and silver are crystalline but insoluble; metacopaivate\r\nof sodium may be crystallized from its watery solution.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The balsam is imported in barrels direct from Pará and\r\nMaranham, sometimes from Rio de Janeiro, and less often from Demerara,\r\nAngostura, Trinidad, Maracaibo, Savanilla, and Cartagena. It often\r\nreaches England by way of Havre and New York. In 1875 there were\r\nexported 10,150 kilogrammes from Savanilla, 99,800 lb. from Ciudad\r\nBolivar (Angostura), and 65,243 kilos. from Pará.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Copaiba is employed in medicine on account of its stimulant\r\naction on the mucous membranes, more especially those of the\r\nurino-genital organs.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Copaiba is not unfrequently fraudulently tampered\r\nwith before it reaches the pharmaceutist; and owing to its naturally\r\nvariable composition, arising in part from its diverse botanical\r\norigin, its purity is not always easily ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe oleo-resin usually dissolves in a small proportion of absolute\r\nalcohol: should it refuse to do so, the presence of some fatty oil\r\nother than castor oil may be surmised. To detect an admixture of this\r\nlatter, one part of the balsam should be heated with four of spirit\r\nof wine (sp. gr. 0·838). On cooling, the mixture separates into two\r\nportions, the upper of which will contain any castor oil present,\r\ndissolved in alcohol and the essential oil. On evaporation of this\r\nupper layer, castor oil may be recognized by its odour; but still more\r\npositively by heating it with caustic soda and lime, when œnanthol will\r\nbe formed, the presence of which may be ascertained by its peculiar\r\nsmell. By the latter test an admixture of even one per cent. of castor\r\noil can be proved.\r\n\r\nThe presence of fatty oil in any considerable quantity is likewise made\r\nevident by the greasiness of the residue, when the balsam is deprived\r\nof its essential oil by prolonged boiling with water.\r\n\r\nThe admixture of some volatile oil with copaiba can mostly be detected\r\nby the odour, especially when the balsam is dropped on a piece of\r\nwarmed metal. Spirit of wine may also be advantageously tried for\r\nthe same purpose. It dissolves but very sparingly the volatile oil\r\nof copaiba: the resins of the latter are also not abundantly soluble\r\nin it. Hence, if shaken with the balsam, it would remove at once the\r\nlarger portion of any essential oil that might have been added. For the\r\nrecognition of Wood Oil if mixed with copaiba, see page 233, note 1.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—Under this head two drugs deserve mention, namely\r\n_Gurjun Balsam_ or _Wood Oil_, described at p. 88, and _Oleo-resin of\r\nHardwickia pinnata_ Roxb.—The tree, which is of a large size, belongs\r\nto the order _Leguminosæ_ and is nearly related to _Copaifera_.\r\nAccording to Beddome,[897] it is very common in the dense moist forests\r\nof the South Travancore Ghats, and has also been found in South Canara.\r\nThe natives extract the oleo-resin in exactly the same method as that\r\nfollowed by the aborigines of Brazil in the case of copaiba,—that is to\r\nsay, they make a deep notch reaching to the heart of the trunk, from\r\nwhich after a time it flows out.\r\n\r\n[897] _Flora Sylvatica for Southern India_, Madras, part 24 (1872),\r\n255.\r\n\r\nThis oleo-resin, which has the smell and taste of copaiba, but a\r\nmuch darker colour, was first examined by one of us in 1865, having\r\nbeen sent from the India Museum as a sample of Wood Oil; it was\r\nsubsequently forwarded to us in more ample quantity by Dr. Bidie of\r\nMadras. It is a thick, viscid fluid, which, owing to its intense\r\ntint, looks black when seen in bulk by reflected light; yet it is\r\nperfectly transparent. Viewed in a thin layer by transmitted light, it\r\nis light _yellowish-green_, in a thick layer _vinous-red_,—hence is\r\ndichromic. It is not fluorescent, nor is it gelatinized or rendered\r\nturbid by being heated to 130° C., thus differing from Wood Oil.[898]\r\nBroughton[899] obtained by prolonged distillation with water an\r\nessential oil to the extent of 25 per cent. from an old specimen,\r\nand of more than 40 per cent. from one recently collected. The oil\r\nwas found to have the same composition as that of copaiba, to boil\r\nat 225° C., and to rotate the plane of polarization to the left. The\r\nresin[900] is probably of two kinds, of which one at least possesses\r\nacid properties. Broughton made many attempts, but without success, to\r\nobtain from the resin crystals of copaivic acid.\r\n\r\nThe balsam of _Hardwickia_ has been used in India for gonorrhœa, and\r\nwith as much success as copaiba.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUMMI ACACIÆ.\r\n\r\n_Gummi Arabicum_; _Gum Arabic_; F. _Gomme Arabique_; G. _Arabisches\r\nGummi_, _Acacien-Gummi_, _Kordofan-Gummi_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—Among the plants abounding in mucilage, numerous\r\nAcaciæ of various countries are in the first line. The species\r\nparticularly known for affording the largest quantities of the finest\r\ngum arabic is _Acacia Senegal_[901] Willdenow (syn. _Mimosa Senegal_\r\nL., _A. Verek_ Guillemin et Perrottet), a small tree not higher than\r\n20 feet, growing abundantly on sandy soils in Western Africa, chiefly\r\nnorth of the river Senegal, where it constitutes extensive forests. It\r\nis called by the negroes _Verek_. The same tree is likewise found in\r\nSouthern Nubia, Kordofan, and in the region of the Atbara in Eastern\r\nAfrica, where it is known as _Hashab_. It has a greyish bark, the inner\r\nlayers of which are strongly fibrous, small yellowish flowers densely\r\narranged in spikes 2 to 3 inches long, and exceeding the bipinnate\r\nleaves, and a broad legume 3 to 4 inches in length containing 5 to 6\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\n[898] It may be further distinguished from Wood Oil as well as from\r\ncopaiba, if tested in the following simple manner:—Put into a tube\r\n19 drops of bisulphide of carbon and one drop of the oleo-resin, and\r\nshake them together. Then add one drop of a mixture of equal parts of\r\nstrong sulphuric and nitric (1·42) acids. After a little agitation the\r\nappearance of the respective mixtures will be as follows:—\r\n\r\n_Copaiba_—Colour faint reddish-brown, with deposit of resin on sides of\r\ntube.\r\n\r\n_Wood Oil_—Colour intense purplish-red, becoming violet after some\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n_Oleo-resin of Hardwickia_—No perceptible alteration; the mixture pale\r\ngreenish yellow.\r\n\r\nBy this test the presence in copaiba of one-eighth of its volume of\r\nWood Oil may be easily shown.\r\n\r\n[899] Beddome, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n[900] See also Hazlett, _Madras Monthly Journ. of Med. Science_, June\r\n1872.\r\n\r\n[901] Figures in Guillemin and Perrottet _Floræ Senegamb. tent._ 1830,\r\np. 246, tab. 56; also Bentley and Trimen, _Med. Plants_, part 17\r\n(1877).\r\n\r\nAccording to Schweinfurth,[902] it is this tree exclusively that yields\r\nthe fine white gum of the countries bordering the Upper Nile, and\r\nespecially of Kordofan. He states that only brownish or reddish sorts\r\nof gum are produced by the Talch, Talha or Kakul, _Acacia stenocarpa_\r\nHochstetter, by the Ssoffar, _A. fistula_ Schweinf. (_A. Seyal_ Delile,\r\nvar. _Fistula_), as well as by the Ssant or Sont, _A. nilotica_ Desfont\r\n(_A. arabica_ Willd.). These trees grow in north-eastern Africa; the\r\nlast named is, moreover, widely distributed all over tropical Africa\r\nas far as Senegambia,[903] Mozambique and Natal, and also extends to\r\nSindh, Gujarat[904] and Central India. We find even the first sort,\r\n“Karami,” of gum exported from the Somali coast,[905] to be inferior\r\nto good common Arabic gum. Hildebrandt (1875) mentions that gum is\r\nthere largely collected from _Acacia abyssinica_ Hochst. and _A.\r\nglaucophylla_ Steudel.\r\n\r\n=History=—The history of this drug carries us back to a remote\r\nantiquity. The Egyptian fleets brought gum from the gulf of Aden as\r\nearly as the 17th century B.C. Thus in the treasury of king Rhampsinit\r\n(Ramses III.) at Medinet Abu, there are representations of gum-trees,\r\ntogether with heaps of gum. The symbol used to signify _gum_, is read\r\n_Kami-en-punt_. i.e. _gum_ from the country of Punt. This, in all\r\nprobability, includes both the Somali coast as well as that of the\r\nopposite parts of Arabia (see article Olibanum, p. 136). Thus, gum is\r\nof frequent occurrence in Egyptian inscriptions; sometimes mention is\r\nmade of gum from Canaan. The word _kami_ is the original of the Greek\r\nκόμμι, whence through the Latin our own word _gum_.[906]\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians used gum largely in painting; an inscription exists which\r\nstates that in one particular instance a solution of _Kami_ (gum) was\r\nused to render adherent the mineral pigment called _chesteb_,[907] the\r\nname applied to lapis lazuli or to a glass coloured blue by cobalt.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Greeks, we find that Theophrastus in the 3rd and 4th\r\ncentury B.C. mentioned Κόμμι as a product of the Egyptian Ἂκανθα, of\r\nwhich tree there was a forest in the Thebaïs of Upper Egypt. Strabo\r\nalso, in describing the district of Arsinöe, the modern Fayûm, says\r\nthat gum is got from the forest of the Thebaïc _Akanthe_.\r\n\r\nCelsus in the 1st century mentions _Gummi acanthinum_; Dioscorides\r\nand Pliny also describe Egyptian gum, which the latter values at 3\r\n_denarii_ [2_s._] per lb.\r\n\r\nIn those times gum no doubt used to be shipped from north-eastern\r\nAfrica to Arabia; there is no evidence showing that Arabia itself had\r\never furnished the chief bulk of the drug. The designation gum _arabic_\r\noccurs in Diodorus Siculus (2, 49) in the first century of our era,\r\nalso in the list of goods of Alexandria mentioned in our article on\r\nGalbanum.\r\n\r\n[902] _Aufzählung und Beschreibung der Acacien-Artendes\r\nNilgebiets.—Linnæa_, i. (1867) 308-376, with 21 plates. Schweinfurth’s\r\nobservations are strongly confirmed by an account of the commerce of\r\nKhartum in the _Zeitschrift für Erdkunde_, ii. (1867, Berlin) 474.\r\n\r\n[903] The _A. Adansonii_ Guill. et Perr. is the same tree.\r\n\r\n[904] The “_Kikar_” of the Punjaub, or “_Babul_” or “_Babur_” of\r\nCentral India.\r\n\r\n[905] As presented to me by Capt. Hunter of Aden, July 1877.—F. A. F..\r\n\r\n[906] We have to thank Professor Dümichen for most of the information\r\nrelating to Egypt, which may be partly found in his own works, and\r\npartly in those of Brugsch, Ebers, and Lepsius.\r\n\r\n[907] Lepsius, _Abhandl. der Akademie der Wissensch. zu Berlin_ for\r\n1871, p. 77. 126. Metalle in den Aegyptischen Inschriften.\r\n\r\nGum was employed by the Arabian physicians and by those of the school\r\nof Salerno, yet its utility in medicine and the arts was but little\r\nappreciated in Europe until a much later period. For the latter purpose\r\nat least the gummy exudations of indigenous trees were occasionally\r\nresorted to, as distinctly pointed out about the beginning of the 12th\r\ncentury, by Theophilus or Rogker:[908] “gummi quot exit de arbore\r\nceraso vel pruno.“\r\n\r\nDuring the middle ages, the small supplies that reached Europe were\r\nprocured through the Italian traders from Egypt and Turkey. Thus\r\nPegolotti,[909] who wrote a work on commerce about A.D. 1340, speaks of\r\ngum arabic as one of the drugs sold at Constantinople by the _pound_\r\nnot by the _quintal_. Again, in a list of drugs liable to duty at Pisa\r\nin 1305,[910] and in a similar list relating to Paris in 1349,[911] we\r\nfind mention of gum arabic. It is likewise named by Pasi,[912] in 1521,\r\nas an export from Venice to London.\r\n\r\nGum also reached Europe from Western Africa, with which region the\r\nPortuguese had a direct trade as early as 1449.\r\n\r\n=Production=—Respecting the origin of gum in the tribe _Acaciæ_,\r\nno observations have been made similar to those of H. von Mohl on\r\ntragacanth.[913]\r\n\r\nIt appears that gum generally exudes from the trees spontaneously,\r\nin sufficient abundance to render wounding the bark superfluous. The\r\nSomali tribes of East Africa, however, are in the habit of promoting\r\nthe outflow by making long incisions in the stem and branches of the\r\ntree.[914] In Kordofan the lumps of gum are broken off with an axe, and\r\ncollected in baskets.\r\n\r\nThe most valued product, called _Hashabi_ gum, from the province of\r\nDejara in Kordofan, is sent northward from Bara and El Obeid to Dabbeh\r\non the Nile, and thence down the river to Egypt; or it reaches the\r\nWhite Nile at Mandjara.\r\n\r\nA less valuable gum, known as _Hashabi el Jesire_, comes from Sennaar\r\non the Blue Nile; and a still worse from the barren table-land of\r\nTakka, lying between the eastern tributaries of the Blue Nile and the\r\nAtbara and Mareb; and from the highlands of the Bisharrin Arabs between\r\nKhartum and the Red Sea. This gum is transported by way of Khartum or\r\nEl Mekheir (Berber), or by Suakin on the Red Sea. Hence, the worst kind\r\nof gum is known in Egypt as _Samagh Savakumi_ (_Suakin Gum_).\r\n\r\nAccording to Munzinger,[915] a better sort of gum is produced along\r\nthe Samhara coast towards Berbera, and is shipped at Massowa. Some of\r\nit reaches Egypt by way of Jidda, which town being in the district of\r\nArabia called the Hejaz, the gum thence brought receives the name of\r\n_Samagh Hejazi_; it is also called _Jiddah_ or _Gedda Gum_. The gums\r\nof Zeila, Berbera and the Somali country about Gardafui, are shipped\r\nto Aden, or direct to Bombay. A little gum is collected in Southern\r\nArabia, but the quantity is said to be insignificant.[916]\r\n\r\n[908] _Schedula diversarum artium_, Ilg’s edition in Eitelberger’s\r\n_Quellenschriften für Kunstgeschichte_, vii.

F..\r\n\r\n[916] Vaughan, _l.c._\r\n\r\nIn the French colony of Senegal, gum, which is one of its principal\r\nproductions, is collected chiefly in the country lying north of the\r\nriver, by the Moors who exchange it for European commodities. The\r\ngathering commences after the rainy season in November when the wind\r\nbegins to set from the desert, and continues till the month of July.\r\nThe gum is shipped for the most part to Bordeaux. The quantity annually\r\nimported into France since 1828 from Senegal is varying from between 1½\r\nto 5 millions of kilogrammes.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Gum arabic does not exhibit any very characteristic\r\nforms like those observable in gum tragacanth. The finest white gum\r\nof Kordofan, which is that most suitable for medicinal use, occurs in\r\nlumps of various sizes from that of a walnut downwards. They are mostly\r\nof ovoid or spherical form, rarely vermicular, with the surface in the\r\nunbroken masses, rounded,—in the fragments, angular. They are traversed\r\nby numerous fissures, and break easily and with a vitreous fracture.\r\nThe interior is often less fissured than the outer portion. At 100° C.\r\nthe cracks increase, and the gum becomes extremely friable. In moist\r\nair, it slowly absorbs about 6 per cent. of water.\r\n\r\nThe finest gum arabic is perfectly clear and colourless; inferior\r\nkinds have a brownish, reddish or yellowish tint of greater or\r\nless intensity, and are more or less contaminated with accidental\r\nimpurities such as bark. The finest white gum turns black and assumes\r\nan empyreumatic taste, when it is kept for months at a temperature of\r\nabout 98° C., either in an open vessel, or enclosed in a glass tube,\r\nafter having been previously dried over sulphuric acid or not.\r\n\r\nAn aqueous solution of gum deviates the plane of polarization 5° to the\r\nleft in a column 50 mm. long; but after being long kept, it becomes\r\nstrongly acid, the gum having been partly converted into sugar, and its\r\noptical properties are altered. An alkaline solution of cupric tartrate\r\nis not reduced by solution of gum even at a boiling heat, unless it\r\ncontains a somewhat considerable proportion of sugar, extractable by\r\nalcohol, or a fraudulent admixture of dextrin.\r\n\r\nWe found the sp. gr. of the purest pieces of colourless gum dried in\r\nthe air at 15° C., to be 1·487; but it increases to 1·525, if the gum\r\nis dried at 100°.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks apply chiefly to the fine white gum of Kordofan,\r\nthe _Picked Turkey Gum_ or _White Sennaar Gum_ of druggists. The other\r\nsorts which are met with in the London market are the following:—\r\n\r\n1. _Senegal Gum_—As stated above, this gum is an important item of the\r\nFrench trade with Africa, but is not much used in England. Its colour\r\nis usually yellowish or somewhat reddish, and the lumps, which are of\r\nlarge size, are often elongated or vermicular. Moreover Senegal gum\r\nnever exhibits the numerous fissures seen in Kordofan gum, so that the\r\nmasses are much firmer and less easily broken. In every other respect,\r\nwhether chemical or optical, we find[917] Senegal gum and Kordofan\r\ngum to be identical; and the two, notwithstanding their different\r\nappearance, are produced by one and the same species of _Acacia_,\r\nnamely _Acacia Senegal_.\r\n\r\n2. _Suakin Gum, Talca_ or _Talha Gum_, yielded by _Acacia\r\nstenocarpa_, and by _A. Seyal_ var. _Fistula_, is remarkable for its\r\nbrittleness, which occasions much of it to arrive in the market in a\r\nsemi-pulverulent state. It is a mixture of nearly colourless and of\r\nbrownish gum, with here and there pieces of a deep reddish-brown. Large\r\ntears have a dull opaque look, by reason of the innumerable minute\r\nfissures which penetrate the rather bubbly mass. It is imported from\r\nAlexandria.\r\n\r\n3. _Morocco, Mogador_ or _Brown Barbary Gum_—consists of tears of\r\nmoderate size, often vermiform, and of a rather uniform, light, dusky\r\nbrown tint. The tears which are internally glassy become cracked on the\r\nsurface and brittle if kept in a warm room; they are perfectly soluble\r\nin water. The above mentioned _Acacia nilotica_ is supposed to be the\r\nsource of the gum exported from Morocco, and also from Fezzan.\r\n\r\nGums of various kinds, including the resin Sandrac, were exported from\r\nMorocco in the year 1872 to the extent of 5110 cwt., a quantity much\r\nbelow the average.[918]\r\n\r\n4. _Cape Gum_—This gum, which is uniformly of an amber brown, is\r\nproduced in plenty in the Cape Colony, as a spontaneous exudation of\r\n_Acacia horrida_ Willd. (_A. Karroo_ Hayne, _A. capensis_ Burch.), a\r\nlarge tree, the _Doornboom_, _Wittedoorn_ or _Karródoorn_ of the Cape\r\ncolonists, the commonest tree of the lonely deserts of South Africa.\r\nThe _Blue Book_ of the Cape Colony, published in 1873, states the\r\nexport of gum in 1872 as 101,241 lb.\r\n\r\n5. _East India Gum_—The best qualities consist of tears of various\r\nsizes, sometimes as large as an egg, internally transparent and\r\nvitreous, of a pale amber or pinkish hue, completely soluble in water.\r\nThis gum is largely shipped from Bombay, but is almost wholly the\r\nproduce of Africa; the imports into Bombay from the Red Sea ports, Aden\r\nand the African Coast in the year 1872-73, were 14,352 cwt. During the\r\nsame year the shipments from Bombay to the United Kingdom amounted to\r\n4,561 cwt.[919]\r\n\r\n6. _Australian Gum, Wattle Gum_—This occurs in large hard globular\r\ntears and lumps, occasionally of a pale yellow, yet more often of an\r\namber or of a reddish-brown hue. It is transparent and entirely soluble\r\nin water; the mucilage is strongly adhesive, and said to be less\r\nliable to crack when dry than that of some other gums. The solution,\r\nespecially that of the darker and inferior kinds, contains a little\r\ntannin, evidently derived from the very astringent bark which is often\r\nattached to the gum.\r\n\r\n_A. pycnantha_ Benth.; _A. decurrens_ Willd. (_A. mollissima_ Willd.,\r\n_A. dealbata_ Link), _Black_ or _Green Wattle-tree_ of the colonists,\r\nand _A. homalophylla_ A. Cunn., are the trees which furnish the gum\r\narabic of Australia.[920]\r\n\r\n[917] Flückiger, in the _Jahresbericht_ of Wiggers and Husemann, 1869.\r\n149.\r\n\r\n[918] _Consular Reports_, August, 1873. 917.\r\n\r\n[919] _Statement of the Trade and Navigation of the Presidency of\r\nBombay for_ 1872-73, pt. ii. 34. 77.\r\n\r\n[920] P. von Müller, _Select Plants for industrial culture in\r\nVictoria_. 1876; 2. 4.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Characters and Composition=—At ordinary temperatures gum\r\ndissolves very slowly and without affecting the thermometer in an\r\nequal weight of water, forming a thick, glutinous, slightly opalescent\r\nliquid, having a mawkish taste and decidedly acid reaction. At higher\r\ntemperatures the dissolution of gum is but slightly accelerated, and\r\nwater does not take up a much larger quantity even at 100°. The finest\r\ngum dried at 100° C. forms with two parts of water a mucilage of sp.\r\ngr. 1·149 at 15° C.\r\n\r\nThis solution mixes with glycerine, and the mixture may be evaporated\r\nto the consistence of a jelly without any separation taking place.\r\nSolid gum in lumps, on the contrary, is but little affected by\r\nconcentrated glycerine. In other liquids, gum is insoluble or only\r\nslightly soluble, unless there is a considerable quantity of water\r\npresent. Thus 100 parts of spirit of wine containing 22 volumes per\r\ncent. of alcohol, dissolve 57 parts of gum; spirit containing 40 per\r\ncent. of alcohol takes up 10 parts, and spirit of 50 per cent. only 4\r\nparts. Aqueous alcohol of 60 per cent. no longer dissolves gum, but\r\nextracts from it a small quantity (⅓ to ½ per cent. according to the\r\nvariety) of resin colouring matter, glucose, calcium chloride, and\r\nother salts.\r\n\r\nNeutral acetate of lead does not precipitate gum arabic mucilage; but\r\nthe basic acetate forms, even in a very dilute solution, a precipitate\r\nof definite constitution.\r\n\r\nSoluble silicates, borates, and ferric salts render gum solution\r\nturbid, or thicken it to a jelly. It is not a compound of gum with any\r\nof these substances which is formed, but in the cases of the first,\r\nbasic silicates separate. No alteration is produced by silver salts,\r\nmercuric chloride or iodine. Ammonium oxalate throws down the lime\r\ncontained in a solution of gum. Gum dissolves in an ammoniacal solution\r\nof cupric oxide. Acted upon by nitric acid, mucic acid is produced.\r\n\r\nSmall, air-dried lumps of gum lose by desiccation over concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid (or by heating them in the water-bath) 12 to 16 per\r\ncent. of water. If gum independently of its amount of lime, be\r\npresented by the formula C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ + 3H₂O, the loss of 3 molecules\r\nof water will correspond to a decrease in weight of 13·6 per cent.;\r\nin carefully selected colourless pieces, we have found it to amount\r\nto 13·14 per cent. At a temperature of about 150° C., gum parts with\r\nanother molecule of water, and partly loses its solubility and assumes\r\na brownish hue and empyreumatic taste. Gum already by keeping it for\r\na week at a temperature not exceeding 95° C. gradually acquires a\r\ndecidedly empyreumatic taste. We have also observed, on the other hand,\r\na fine white gum affording an imperfect solution which was _glairy_,\r\nlike the mucilage of marshmallow, but in no other respect could we find\r\nthat it differed from ordinary gum. On exposing it for some days to a\r\ntemperature of 95° C., it afforded a solution of the usual character.\r\n\r\nWhen gum arabic is dissolved in cold water and the solution is slightly\r\nacidulated with hydrochloric acid, alcohol produces it in a precipitate\r\nof _Arabin_ or _Arabic Acid_. It may be also prepared by placing a\r\nsolution of gum (1 gum + 5 water), acidulated with hydrochloric acid,\r\non a dialyser, when the calcium salt will diffuse out, leaving behind a\r\nsolution of arabin.\r\n\r\nSolution of arabin differs from one of gum in not being precipitated by\r\nalcohol. Having been dried, it loses its solubility, merely swelling\r\nin water, but not dissolving even at a boiling heat. If an alkali is\r\nadded, it forms a solution like ordinary gum. Neubauer who observed\r\nthese facts (1854-57) showed that gum arabic is essentially an acid\r\ncalcium salt of arabic acid.\r\n\r\n_Arabic Acid_ dried at 100° C. has the composition C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁, and gives\r\nup H₂O when it unites with bases. It has however a great tendency to\r\nform salts containing a large excess of acid. An acid calcium arabate\r\nof the composition (C₁₂H₂₁O₁₁)₂Ca + 3 (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ + 5 OH) would afford\r\nby incineration 4·95 per cent. of calcium carbonate. Nearly this\r\namount of ash is in fact sometimes yielded by gum. The most carefully\r\nselected colourless pieces of it yield from 2·7 to 4 per cent. of ash,\r\nconsisting mainly of calcium carbonate, but containing also carbonates\r\nof potassium and magnesium. Phosphoric acid appears never to occur in\r\ngums.\r\n\r\nNatural gum may therefore be regarded as a salt of arabic acid having a\r\nlarge excess of acid, or perhaps as a mixture of such salts of calcium,\r\npotassium and magnesium. It is to the presence of these bases, which\r\nare doubtless derived from the cell-wall from which the gum exuded,\r\nthat gum owes its solubility.\r\n\r\nIt still remains unexplained why certain gums, not unprovided with\r\nmineral constituents, merely swell up in water without dissolving, thus\r\nmaterially differing from gum arabic. There is also a marked difference\r\nbetween gum arabic and many other varieties of gum or mucilage, which\r\nimmediately form a plumbic compound if treated with neutral acetate\r\nof lead. The type of the swelling, but not really soluble gums, is\r\nTragacanth, but there are a great many other substances of the same\r\nclass, some of them perfectly resembling gum arabic in external\r\nappearance. The name of _Bassora gum_ has also been applied to the\r\nlatter kinds.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The imports of Gum Arabic into the United Kingdom have been\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n          1871                1872\r\n       76,136 cwt.          42,837 cwt.\r\n    value £250,088.      value £123,080.\r\n\r\nThe country whence by far the largest supplies are shipped, is Egypt.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Gum is employed in medicine rather as an adjuvant than as\r\npossessing any remedial powers of its own.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—A great number of trees are capable of affording gums\r\nmore or less similar to gum arabic. There is to be mentioned for\r\ninstance _Prosopis glandulosa_ Torrey, a tree growing from 30 to 40\r\nfeet in height, occurring very abundantly in Texas, and extending as\r\nfar west as the Colorado and the gulf of California. It is universally\r\nknown by its Mexican name _Mesquite_. It belongs to the same suborder\r\nof the Mimosæ like the Acaciæ tribe of the Adenanthereæ. _Mesquite gum_\r\nagrees not with the fine description, but with the inferior sorts of\r\ngum arabic, and is sometimes used in America,[921] since 1854, in the\r\nmanufacture of confectionery and the arts.\r\n\r\n_Feronia Gum_, or _Wood Apple Gum_. This is the produce of _Feronia\r\nElephantum_ Correa, a spiny tree, 50 to 60 feet high, of the order of\r\n_Aurantiaceæ_, common throughout India from the hot valleys of the\r\nHimalaya to Ceylon, and also found in Java. There exudes from its bark\r\nabundance of gum, which appears not to be collected for exportation\r\n_per se_, but rather to be mixed indiscriminately with other gum, as\r\nthat of _Acacia_.\r\n\r\n[921] See _Proceedings of Am. Pharm. Assoc._ 1875. 647; _Am. Journ. of\r\nPharm._ 1878. 480.\r\n\r\nFeronia gum sometimes forms small roundish transparent, almost\r\ncolourless tears, more frequently stalactitic or knobby masses, of a\r\nbrownish or reddish colour, more or less deep. In an authentic sample,\r\nfor which we are indebted to Dr. Thwaites of Ceylon, horn-shaped pieces\r\nabout ½ an inch thick and two inches long also occur.\r\n\r\nDissolved in two parts of water, it affords an almost tasteless\r\nmucilage, of much greater viscosity than that of gum arabic made in\r\nthe same proportions. The solution reddens litmus, and is precipitated\r\nlike gum arabic by alcohol, oxalate of ammonium, alkaline silicates,\r\nperchloride of iron, but not by borax. Moreover, the solution of\r\nFeronia gum is precipitated by neutral acetate of lead or caustic\r\nbaryta, but not by potash. If the solution is completely precipitated\r\nby neutral acetate of lead, the residual liquid will be found to\r\ncontain a small quantity of a different gum, identical apparently with\r\ngum arabic, inasmuch as it is not thrown down by acetate of lead.\r\nIf the lime is precipitated from the Feronia mucilage by oxalate of\r\npotassium, the gum partially loses its solubility and forms a turbid\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding experiments, it follows that a larger portion of\r\nFeronia gum is by no means identical with gum arabic. The former, when\r\nexamined in a column of 50 mm. length, deviates the rays of polarized\r\nlight 0°·4 to the right,—not to the _left_ as gum arabic. This was, we\r\nbelieve, the first instance of a dextrogyre gum;[922] Scheibler has\r\nafterwards shown (1873) that there are also dextrogyre varieties among\r\nthe African gum from Sennar. Gum arabic may be combined with oxide of\r\nlead; the compound (arabate of lead) contains 30·6 per cent. of oxide\r\nof lead, whereas the plumbic compound of Feronia gum, dried at 110° C.,\r\nyielded us only 14·76 per cent. of PbO. The formula (C₁₂H₂₁O₁₁)₂Pb +\r\n2(C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁) supposes 14·2 per cent. of oxide of lead.\r\n\r\nFeronia gum repeatedly treated with fuming nitric acid produces\r\nabundant crystals of mucic acid. We found our sample of the gum to\r\nyield 17 per cent. of water, when dried at 110° C. It left 3·55 per\r\ncent. of ash.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATECHU.\r\n\r\n_Catechu nigrum_; _Black Catechu_, _Pegu Catechu_, _Cutch_, _Terra\r\nJaponica_; F. _Cachou_, _Cachou brun ou noir_; G. _Catechu_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—The trees from which this drug is manufactured are\r\nof two species, namely:—\r\n\r\n1. _Acacia Catechu_ Willd. (_Mimosa Catechu_ L. fil., _M. Sundra_\r\nRoxb.[923]), a tree 30 to 40 feet high, with a short, not very straight\r\ntrunk4 to 6 feet in girth, straggling thorny branches, light feathery\r\nfoliage, and dark grey or brown bark, reddish and fibrous internally.\r\n\r\n[922] Flückiger, _Pharm. Journ._ x. (1869). 641.\r\n\r\n[923] Some Indian botanists, as Beddome, regard _Mimosa (Acacia)\r\nSundra_ as distinct from _A. Catechu._—Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, part\r\n17.\r\n\r\nIt is common in most parts of India and Burma, where it is highly\r\nvalued for its wood, which is used for posts and for various domestic\r\npurposes, as well as for making catechu and charcoal, while the\r\nastringent bark serves for tanning. It also grows in the hotter and\r\ndrier parts of Ceylon. _A. Catechu_ abounds in the forests of Tropical\r\nEastern Africa; it is found in the Soudan, Sennaar, Abyssinia, the Noer\r\ncountry, and Mozambique, but in none of these regions is any astringent\r\nextract manufactured from its wood.\r\n\r\n2. _A. Suma_ Kurz[924] (_Mimosa Suma_ Roxb.), a large tree with a red\r\nheartwood, but a white bark, nearly related to the preceding but not\r\nhaving so extensive a geographical range. It grows in the South of\r\nIndia (Mysore), Bengal and Gujerat. The bark is used in tanning, and\r\ncatechu is made from the heartwood.\r\n\r\nThe extract of the wood of these two species of _Acacia_ is _Catechu_\r\nin the true and original sense of the word, a substance not to be\r\nconfounded with _Gambier_, which, though very similar in composition,\r\nis widely diverse in botanical origin, and always regarded in commerce\r\nas a distinct article.\r\n\r\n=History=—Barbosa in his description of the East Indies in 1514[925]\r\nmentions a drug called _Cacho_ as an article of export from Cambay to\r\nMalacca. This is the name for _Catechu_ in some of the languages of\r\nSouthern India.[926]\r\n\r\nAbout fifty years later, Garcia de Orta gave a particular account of\r\nthe same drug[927] under its Hindustani name of _Kat_, first describing\r\nthe tree and then the method of preparing an extract from its wood.\r\nThis latter substance was at that period made up with the flour of\r\na cereal (_Eleusine coracana_ Gärtn.) into tablets or lozenges, and\r\napparently not sold in its simple state: compositions of this kind are\r\nstill met with in India. In the time of Garcia de Orta the drug was an\r\nimportant article of traffic to Malacca and China, as well as to Arabia\r\nand Persia.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these accounts, catechu remained unknown in Europe\r\nuntil the 17th century, when it began to be brought from Japan, or\r\nat least said to be exported from that country. It was known about\r\n1641 to Johannes Schröder,[928] and is quoted at nearly the same time\r\nin several tariffs of German towns, being included in the samples of\r\nmineral origin.[929]\r\n\r\n[924] Brandis, _Forest Flora of North-Western and Central India_, Lond.\r\n1874. 187, from which excellent work we also borrow the description of\r\n_A.

(1876) 1022.\r\n\r\nIn 1671, catechu was noticed as a useful medicine by G. W. Wedel of\r\nJena,[930] who also called attention to the diversity of opinion as\r\nto its mineral or vegetable nature. Schröck[931] in 1677 combated the\r\nnotion of its mineral origin, and gave reasons for considering it a\r\nvegetable substance. A few years later, Cleyer,[932] who had a personal\r\nknowledge of China, pointed out the enormous consumption of catechu for\r\nmastication in the East,—that it is imported into Japan,—that the best\r\ncomes from Pegu, but some also from Surat, Malabar, Bengal, and Ceylon.\r\n\r\nCatechu was received into the London Pharmacopœia of 1721, but was even\r\nthen placed among “_Terræ medicamentosæ_.”\r\n\r\nThe wholesale price in London in 1776 was £16 16_s._ per cwt.; in\r\n1780 £20; in 1793 £14 14_s._, from which it is easy to infer that the\r\nconsumption could only have been very small.[933]\r\n\r\n=Manufacture=—Cutch, commonly called in India _Kát_ or _Kut_, is\r\nan aqueous extract made from the wood of the tree. The process for\r\npreparing it varies slightly in different districts.\r\n\r\nThe tree is reckoned to be of proper age when its trunk is about a foot\r\nin diameter. It is then cut down, and the whole of the woody part,\r\nwith the exception of the smaller branches and the bark, is chopped\r\ninto chips. Some accounts state that only the darker heartwood is thus\r\nused. The chips are then placed with water in earthen jars, a series\r\nof which is arranged over a mud-built fireplace, usually in the open\r\nair. Here the water is made to boil, the liquor as it becomes thick and\r\nstrong being decanted into another vessel, in which the evaporation is\r\ncontinued until the extract is sufficiently inspissated, when it is\r\npoured into moulds made of clay, or of leaves pinned together in the\r\nshape of cups, or in some districts on to a mat covered with the ashes\r\nof cow-dung, the drying in each case being completed by exposure to the\r\nsun and air. The product is a dark brown extract, which is the usual\r\nform in which cutch is known in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn Kumaon in the north of India,[934] a slight modification of\r\nthe process affords a drug of very different appearance. Instead\r\nof evaporating the decoction to the condition of an extract, the\r\ninspissation is stopped at a certain point and the liquor allowed to\r\ncool, “coagulate,” and crystallize over twigs and leaves thrown into\r\nthe pots for the purpose. How this drug is finished off we do not\r\nexactly know, but we are told that by this process there is obtained\r\nfrom each pot about 2 lb. of “_Kath_” or catechu, of an ashy whitish\r\nappearance, which is quite in accordance with the specimens we have\r\nreceived and of which we shall speak further on.\r\n\r\nIn Burma the manufacture and export of cutch form, next to the sale\r\nof timber, the most important item of forest revenue. According to a\r\nreport by the Commissioner of the Prome Division, the trade returns\r\nof 1869-70 show that the quantity of cutch exported from the province\r\nduring the year was 10,782 tons, valued at £193,602, of which nearly\r\none-half was the produce of manufactories situated in the British\r\nterritory. Vast quantities of the wood are consumed as fuel, especially\r\nfor the steamers on the Irrawadi.[935]\r\n\r\n[930] _Usus novus Catechu seu Terræ Japonicæ,—Ephemerides Nat.

It is a dark\r\nbrown, extractiform substance, hard and brittle on the surface of the\r\nmass, but soft and tenacious within, at least when newly imported. The\r\nlarge leaf of _Dipterocarpus tuberculatus_ Roxb., the _Ein_ or _Engben_\r\nof the Burmese, is often placed outside the blocks of extract.\r\n\r\nCutch when dry breaks easily, showing a shining but bubbly and slightly\r\ngranular fracture. When it is soft and is pulled out into a thin film,\r\nit is seen to be translucent, granular and of a bright orange-brown.\r\nWhen further moistened and examined under the microscope, it exhibits\r\nan abundance of minute acicular crystals, precisely as seen in gambier.\r\nWe have observed the same in numerous samples of the dry drug when\r\nrendered pulpy by the addition of water, or moistened with glycerin and\r\nviewed by polarized light.\r\n\r\nThe pale cutch referred to as manufactured in the north of India, is\r\nin the form of irregular fragments of a cake an inch or more thick,\r\nwhich has a laminated structure and appears to have been deposited\r\nin a round-bottomed vessel. It is a porous, opaque, earthly-looking\r\nsubstance of a pale pinkish-brown, light, and easily broken. Under the\r\nmicroscope it is seen to be a mass of needle-shaped crystals exactly\r\nlike gambier, with which in all essential points it corresponds. We\r\nhave received from India the same kind of cutch made into little\r\nround cakes like lozenges, with apparently no addition. The taste of\r\ncutch is astringent, followed by a sensation of sweetness by no means\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Extractiform cutch, such as that of Pegu, which\r\nis the only sort common in Europe, when immersed in cold water turns\r\nwhitish, softens and disintegrates, a small proportion of it dissolving\r\nand forming a deep brown solution. The insoluble part is _Catechin_\r\nin minute acicular crystals. If a little of the thick chocolate-like\r\nliquid made by macerating cutch in water, is heated to the boiling\r\npoint, it is rendered quite transparent (mechanical impurities being\r\nabsent), but becomes turbid on cooling. Ferric chloride forms with this\r\nsolution a dark green precipitate, immediately changing to purple if\r\ncommon water or a trace of free alkali be used.\r\n\r\nEther extracts from cutch, catechin. This substance has been\r\ninvestigated by many chemists, but as yet with discrepant results. It\r\nagrees, according to Etti (1877), with the formula C₁₉H₁₈O₈, when dried\r\nat 80° C. By gently heating catechin, _Catechu-tannic acid_, C₃₈H₃₄O₁₅,\r\nis produced:\r\n\r\n    2(C₁₉H₁₈O₈)-OH₂ = C₃₆H₃₄O₁₅.\r\n\r\nThis is an undoubted acid, readily soluble in water, of decidedly\r\ntanning properties, precipitating also the alkaloids and albumin.\r\nCatechu-tannic acid being the first anhydride of catechin, there\r\nare several more substances of that class; one of them is called\r\n_Catechuretin_. This blackish brown almost insoluble substance is\r\nobtained by heating catechin with concentrated hydrochloric acid at\r\n180°:\r\n\r\n    2(C₁₉H₁₈O₈)-4 OH₂ = C₃₈H₂₈O₁₂.\r\nCatechin, by melting it with caustic potash, affords Protocatechuic\r\nacid, C₆H₃(OH)₂COOH, and Phloroglucin, C₆H₃(OH)₃:\r\n\r\n    C₁₉H₁₈O₈ + 2 OH₂ = 4 H · C₇H₆O₄ · 2 C₆H₆O₃.\r\n\r\nGautier (1877) also obtained the two latter products, but he is of the\r\nopinion that they are due to a somewhat different reaction, the formula\r\nof catechin, as derived from his analyses, being C₂₁H₁₈O₈. He also\r\nasserts that the so-called catechin from Uncaria (see Gambier) is not\r\nidentical with the substance under notice, nor with that found in the\r\nMahogan wood, to which Gautier assigns the formula C₄₂H₃₄O₁₆.\r\n\r\nCrystallized deposits of catechin are sometimes met with in fissures of\r\nthe trunk of Acacia Catechu, and used medicinally in India under the\r\nname _Keersal_.[936]\r\n\r\nLöwe (1873), by exhausting cutch with cold water and then agitating\r\nthe solution with ether, obtained upon the evaporation of the latter a\r\nyellow crystalline substance which he ascertained to be _Quercetin_,\r\nC₂₇H₁₈O₁₂. Its solubility in water is probably favoured by the presence\r\nof catechin, water having but very little action upon pure quercetin.\r\nThe amount of quercetin in cutch is exceedingly small.\r\n\r\nWhen either cutch or gambier is subjected to dry distillation it\r\nyields, in common with many other substances, _Pyrocatechin_, C₆H₄(OH)₂.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The importations of cutch into the United Kingdom from\r\nBritish India (excluding the Straits Settlements and Ceylon) were as\r\nunder, almost the whole being from Bengal and Burma:—\r\n\r\n        1869       1870       1871       1872\r\n    2257 tons.  5252 tons.  4335 tons.  5240 tons.\r\n\r\nThe total value of the cutch imported in 1872 was estimated at £124,458.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Cutch under the name of _Catechu_, which name it shares with\r\ngambier, is employed in medicine as an astringent.\r\n\r\n=Analogous Products=—See our articles Semen Arecæ and Gambier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMYGDALÆ DULCES.\r\n\r\n_Sweet Almonds_; F. _Amandes douces_; G. _Süsse Mandeln_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Prunus Amygdalus_ Baillon[937] var. β. _dulcis_\r\n(_Amygdalus communis_ L. var. β. _dulcis_ DC.)—The native country of\r\nthe almond cannot be ascertained with precision. A. de Candolle,[938]\r\nafter reviewing the statements of various authors concerning the\r\noccurrence of the tree in an apparently wild state, arrives at the\r\nconclusion that its original area possibly extended from Persia,\r\nwestward to Asia Minor and Syria, and even to Algeria. The tree\r\nis found ascending to 4000 feet in the Antilebanon, to 3000 in\r\nMesopotamia, and even to 9000 feet in the Avroman range, not far from\r\nSulemānia, Southern Kurdistan.[939]\r\n\r\n[936] Dymock, _Ph.

(1872) 641.\r\n\r\nAt an early period the tree was spread throughout the entire\r\nMediterranean region, and in favourable situations, far into the\r\ncontinent of Europe. It was apparently introduced into Italy from\r\nGreece, where according to Heldreich,[940] the bitter variety is truly\r\nwild. The almond-tree matures its fruit in the south of England, but is\r\nliable to destruction by frost in many parts of central Europe.\r\n\r\n=History=—The earliest notice of the almond extant is that in the Book\r\nof Genesis,[941] where we read that the patriarch Israel commanded\r\nhis sons to carry with them into Egypt a present consisting of the\r\nproductions of Palestine, one of which is named as _almonds_.\r\n\r\nFrom the copious references to the almond in the writings of\r\nTheophrastus, one cannot but conclude that in his day it was familiarly\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, M. Porcius Cato[942] mentions towards the middle of the\r\n2nd century B.C. _Avellanæ Græcæ_ which we know from later authors\r\nsignified _almonds_. Columella, who wrote about A.D.. 60, calls them\r\n_Nuces Græcæ_. Bitter almonds (“_Amygdali amari_”) are named about this\r\nlatter period by Scribonius Largus.\r\n\r\nAs to more northern Europe, almonds are mentioned together with other\r\ngroceries and spices as early as A.D. 716, in a charter granted\r\nby Chilperic II., King of France, to the monastery of Corbie in\r\nNormandy.[943] In 812 Charlemagne ordered the trees (_Amandalarii_)\r\nto be introduced on the imperial farms. In the later middle ages,\r\nthe cultivation of the almond was carried on about Speier and in the\r\nRhenish Palatinate. We learn from Marino Sanudo[944] that in the\r\nbeginning of the 14th century, almonds had become an important item of\r\nthe Venetian trade to Alexandria. They were doubtless in large part\r\nproduced by the islands of the Greek Archipelago, then under Christian\r\nrule. In Cyprus for instance, the Knights Templar levied tithes in 1411\r\nof _almonds_, honey, and sesamé seed.[945]\r\n\r\nThe consumption of almonds in mediæval cookery was enormous. An\r\ninventory made in 1372 of the effects of Jeanne d’Evreux, queen of\r\nFrance, enumerates only 20 lb. of sugar, but 500 lb. of almonds.[946]\r\n\r\nIn the _Form of Cury_, a manuscript written by the master cooks of King\r\nRichard II., A.D. 1390, are receipts for “_Creme of Almand_, _Grewel of\r\nAlmand_, _Cawdel of Almand Mylke_, _Jowt of Almand Mylke_,” &c.[947]\r\n\r\nAlmonds were sold in England by the “_hundred_” _i.e._ 108 lb.\r\nRogers[948] gives the average price between 1259 and 1350 as 2d., and\r\nbetween 1351 and 1400 as 3⅛d. per lb.\r\n\r\n[940] _Nutzpflanzen Griechenlands_, Athen, 1862. 67.\r\n\r\n[941] Ch. xliii. v. 11; Num. xvii. 8.\r\n\r\n[942] _De Re Rustica_, cap. viii.\r\n\r\n[943] Pardessus, _Diplomata Chartæ_, etc., Paris, 1849. ii. 309.\r\n\r\n[944] _Liber Secretorum Fidelium_, ed.

(1866) 641.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit of the almond tree is a drupe, with a velvety\r\nsarcocarp which at maturity dries, splits, and drops out leaving bare\r\nand still attached to the branch, an oblong, ovate pointed stone,\r\npitted with irregular holes. The seed, about an inch in length, is\r\novate or oblong, more or less compressed, pointed at the upper, blunt\r\nat the lower end, coated with a scurfy, cinnamon-brown skin or testa.\r\nIt is connected with the stone or putamen by a broad funicle, which\r\nruns along its edge for more than a third of its length from the apex;\r\nhence the raphe passes downwards to the rounded end of the seed, where\r\na scar marks the chalaza. From this, a dozen or more ramifying veins\r\nrun up the brown skin towards the pointed end. After an almond has been\r\nmacerated in warm water, the skin is easily removed, bringing with it\r\nthe closely attached translucent inner membrane or endopleura. As the\r\nseed is without albumen, the whole mass within the testa consists of\r\nembryo. This is formed of a pair of plano-convex cotyledons, within\r\nwhich lie the flat leafy plumule and thick radicle, the latter slightly\r\nprojecting from the pointed or basal end of the seed.\r\n\r\nAlmonds have a bland, sweet, nutty flavour. When triturated with water,\r\nthey afford a pure white, milk-like emulsion of agreeable taste.\r\n\r\n=Varieties=—The different sorts of almond vary in form and size, and\r\nmore particularly in the firmness of the shell. This in some varieties\r\nis tender and easily broken in the hand, in others so hard as to\r\nrequire a hammer to fracture it. The form and size of the kernel\r\nlikewise exhibit some variation. The most esteemed are those of Malaga,\r\nknown in trade as _Jordan Almonds_. They are usually imported without\r\nthe shell, and differ from all other sorts in their oblong form and\r\nlarge size. The other kinds of sweet almonds known in the London market\r\nare distinguished in the order of value as _Valencia_, _Sicily_, and\r\n_Barbary_.[949]\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—Three different parts are to be distinguished\r\nin the brown coat of an almond. First, a layer of very large (as much\r\nas ⅓ mm. in diameter) irregular cells, to which the scurfy surface is\r\ndue. If these brittle cells are boiled with caustic soda, they make\r\na brilliant object for microscopic examination in polarized light.\r\nThe two inner layers of the skin are made up of much smaller cells,\r\ntraversed by small fibro-vascular bundles. The brown coat assumes a\r\nbluish hue on addition of perchloride of iron, owing to the presence of\r\ntannic matter.\r\n\r\nThe cotyledons consist of thin-walled parenchyme, fibro-vascular\r\nbundles being not decidedly developed. This tissue is loaded with\r\ngranular albuminous matter, some of which exhibits a crystalloid\r\naspect, as may be ascertained in polarized light. Starch is altogether\r\nwanting in almonds.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The sweet almond contains fixed oil extractable\r\nby boiling ether to the extent of 50 to 55 per cent. A produce of 50\r\nper cent. by the hydraulic press is by no means uncommon.\r\n\r\nThe oil (_Oleum Amygdalæ_) is a thin, light yellow fluid, of sp. gr.\r\n0·92, which does not solidify till cooled to between -10 and-20° C.\r\nWhen fresh, it has a mild nutty taste, but soon becomes rancid by\r\nexposure to the air; it is not, however, one of the drying oils. It\r\nconsists almost wholly of the glycerin compound of _Oleic Acid_,\r\nC₁₈H₃₄O₂.\r\n\r\n[949] To be consulted for further information: Bianca, _G. Manuale\r\ndella Cultivazione del Mandorlo in Sicilia_, Palermo, 1874 (444 pages).\r\n\r\nAlmonds easily yield to cold water a sugar tasting like honey, which\r\nreduces alkaline cupric tartrate even in the cold, and is therefore in\r\npart grape sugar. Pelouze however (1855) obtained from almonds 10 per\r\ncent. of cane-sugar. The amount of gum appears to be very small; Fleury\r\n(1865) found that the _total amount_ of sugar, dextrin and mucilage was\r\naltogether only 6·29 per cent.\r\n\r\nIf almonds are kept for several days in alcohol, crystals of asparagine\r\n(see article Rad. Althææ, p. 93) make their appearance, as shown by\r\nHenschen (1872), and by Portes (1876).\r\n\r\nThe almond yields 3·7 per cent. of nitrogen, corresponding to about 24\r\nper cent. of albuminoid matters. These have been elaborately examined\r\nby Robiquet (1837-38), Ortloff (1846), Bull (1849), and Ritthausen\r\n(1872).[950] The experiments tend to show that there exist in the\r\nalmond two different protein substances; Robiquet termed one of these\r\nbodies _Synaptase_, while others applied to it the name _Emulsin_.[951]\r\nCommaille (1866) named the second albuminous substance _Amandin_; it\r\nis the _Almond-legumin_ of Gmelin’s _Chemistry_, the _Conglutin_ of\r\nRitthausen. Emulsin has not yet been freed from earthly phosphates\r\nwhich, when it is precipitated by alcohol from any aqueous solution,\r\noften amount to a third of its weight. Amandin may be precipitated\r\nfrom its aqueous solution by acetic acid. According to Ritthausen,\r\nthese bodies are to be regarded as modifications of one and the same\r\nsubstance, namely vegetable casein.\r\n\r\nBlanched almonds comminuted yield, when slightly warmed with dilute\r\npotash, a small quantity of hydrocyanic acid and of ammonia; the former\r\nmay be made manifest by means of Schönbein’s test pointed out at p. 250.\r\n\r\nThe ash of almonds, amounting to from 3 to nearly 5 per cent., consists\r\nchiefly of phosphates of potassium, magnesium and calcium.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—The quantity of almonds imported into the\r\nUnited Kingdom in 1872 was 70,270 cwt., valued at £204,592. Of this\r\nquantity, Morocco supplied 33,500 cwt., and Spam with the Canary\r\nIslands 22,000 cwt., the remainder being made up by Italy, Portugal,\r\nFrance, and other countries. The imports into the United Kingdom in\r\n1876 were 77,169 cwt., valued at £244,078. Almonds are largely shipped\r\nfrom the Persian Gulf: in the year 1872-73, there were imported thence\r\ninto Bombay, 15,878 cwt., besides 3,049 cwt. from other countries.[952]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Sweet almonds may be used for the extraction of almond oil, yet\r\nthey are but rarely so employed (at least in England) on account of the\r\ninferior value of the residual cake. The only other use of the sweet\r\nalmond in medicine is for making the emulsion called _Mistura Amygdalæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMYGDALÆ AMARÆ.\r\n\r\n_Bitter Almonds_; F. _Amandes amères_; G. _Bittere Mandeln_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Prunus Amygdalus_ Baillon var. _a. amara_\r\n(_Amygdalus communis_ L. var. _a. amara_ DC.). The Bitter Almond\r\ntree is not distinguished from the sweet by any permanent botanical\r\ncharacter, and its area of growth appears to be the same (see p. 244).\r\n\r\n[950] _Die Eiweisskörper der Getreidearten, Hülsenfrüchte und\r\nOelsamen_, Bonn, 1872. 199.\r\n\r\n[951] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, xviii.

Bitter almonds and their\r\npoisonous properties were well known in the antiquity, and used\r\nmedicinally during the middle ages. Valerius Cordus prescribed them as\r\nan ingredient of trochisci.[953]\r\n\r\nAs early as the beginning of the present century, it was shown by the\r\nexperiments of Bohm, a pharmaceutical assistant of Berlin, that the\r\naqueous distillate of bitter almonds contains hydrocyanic acid and a\r\npeculiar oil which cannot be obtained from sweet almonds. It was then\r\ninferred that hydrocyanic acid itself might be poisonous, a fact which,\r\nstrange to say, had not been noticed by Scheele, when he discovered\r\nthat acid in 1782, as obtained by distilling potassium ferrocyanate\r\nwith sulphuric acid. The dangerous action of hydrocyanic was then\r\nascertained in 1802 and 1803 by Schaub and Schrader.[954]\r\n\r\n=Description=—Bitter almonds agree in outward appearance, form, and\r\nstructure with sweet almonds; they exist under several varieties,\r\nbut there is none so far as we know that in size and form resembles\r\nthe long sweet almond of Malaga.[955] In general, bitter almonds are\r\nof smaller size than sweet. Triturated with water, they afford the\r\nsame white emulsion as sweet almonds, but it has a strong odour of\r\nhydrocyanic acid and a very bitter taste.\r\n\r\n=Varieties=—These are distinguished in their order of goodness, as\r\nFrench, Sicilian, and Barbary.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—In this respect, no difference between sweet\r\nand bitter almonds can be pointed out. If thin slices of the latter are\r\ndeprived of fat oil by means of benzol, and then kept for some years in\r\nglycerin, an abundance of crystals is slowly formed, of what we suppose\r\nto be amygdalin.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Bitter almonds, when comminuted and mixed with\r\nwater, immediately evolve the odour of bitter almond oil. The more\r\ngenerally diffused substances are the same in both kinds of almond, and\r\nthe fixed oil in particular of the bitter almond is identical with that\r\nof the sweet. Bitter almonds however contain on an average a somewhat\r\nlower proportion of oil than the sweet. In one instance that has come\r\nto our knowledge in which 28 cwt. of bitter almonds were submitted\r\nto pressure, the yield of oil was at the rate of 43·6 per cent. Mr.\r\nUmney, director of the laboratory of Messrs. Herrings and Co., where\r\nlarge quantities of bitter almonds are submitted to powerful hydraulic\r\npressure, gives 44·2 as the average percentage of oil obtained during\r\nthe years 1871-2.\r\n\r\n[953] _Dispensator_., Paris, 1548. 336. 337. 343.\r\n\r\n[954] J.

Preyer, _Die Blausäure_, Bonn, 1870. 152.\r\n\r\n[955] Hence to avoid bitter almonds being used instead of sweet, the\r\n_British Pharmacopœia_ directs that _Jordan Almonds_ alone shall be\r\nemployed for Confection of Almonds.\r\n\r\nRobiquet and Boutron-Charland in 1830 prepared from bitter almonds a\r\ncrystalline substance, _Amygdalin_, and found that bitter almond oil\r\nand hydrocyanic acid can no longer be obtained from bitter almonds,\r\nthe amygdalin of which has been removed by alcohol. Liebig and Wöhler\r\nin 1837 showed that it is solely the decomposition of this body (under\r\nconditions to be explained presently), that occasions the formation of\r\nthe two compounds above named. Disregarding secondary products (ammonia\r\nand formic acid), the reaction takes place as represented in the\r\nfollowing equation:\r\n\r\n    C₂₀H₂₇NO₁₁ + 3 OH₂ = OH₂ · 2 (C₆H₁₂O₆) · NCH · C₇H₆O.\r\n    Crystallized               Anhydrous  Hydro- Bitter\r\n     Amygdalin.                 Dextro-  cyanic  Almond\r\n                                glucose.   Acid.   Oil.\r\n\r\nThis memorable investigation first brought under notice a body of the\r\nglucoside class, now so numerous.\r\n\r\nAmygdalin may be obtained crystallized when almonds deprived of their\r\noil are boiled with alcohol of 84 to 94 per cent. The product amounts\r\nat most to 2½ or 3 per cent. Amygdalin _per se_ dissolves in 15 parts\r\nof water at 8-12° C., forming a neutral, bitter, inodorous liquid,\r\nquite destitute of poisonous properties.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from the investigations of Portes (1877) that in young\r\nalmonds, amygdalin is formed before the emulsin.\r\n\r\nWhen bitter almonds have been freed from amygdalin and fixed oil, cold\r\nwater extracts from the residue chiefly emulsin and another albuminoid\r\nmatter separable by acetic acid. The emulsin upon addition of alcohol\r\nfalls down in thick flocks, which, after draining, form with cold\r\nwater a slightly opalescent solution. This liquid added to an aqueous\r\nsolution of amygdalin, renders it turbid, and developes in it bitter\r\nalmond oil. The reaction takes place in the same manner, if the emulsin\r\nhas not been previously purified by acetic acid and alcohol, or if\r\nan emulsion of sweet almonds used. But after boiling, an emulsion of\r\nalmonds is no longer capable of decomposing amygdalin.\r\n\r\nWhat alteration the emulsin itself undergoes in this reaction, or\r\nwhether it suffers any alteration at all, has not been clearly made\r\nout. The reaction does not appear to take place necessarily in atomic\r\nproportions; it does not cease until the emulsin has decomposed\r\nabout three times its own weight of amygdalin, provided always that\r\nsufficient water is present to hold all the products in solution.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of _Prunus Lauro-cerasus_ L., the bark of _P. Padus_ L., and\r\nthe organs of many allied plants, also contain emulsin or a substance\r\nanalogous to it, not yet isolated. In the seeds of various plants\r\nbelonging to natural orders not botanically allied to the almond, as\r\nfor example in those of mustard, hemp, and poppy, and even in yolk\r\nof egg, albuminous substances occur which are capable of acting upon\r\namygdalin in the same manner. Boiling dilute hydrochloric acid induces\r\nthe same decomposition, with the simultaneous production of formic acid.\r\n\r\nThe distillation of bitter almonds is known to offer some difficulties\r\non account of the large quantity present of albuminous substances,\r\nwhich give rise to bumping and frothing. Michael Pettenkofer (1861) has\r\nfound that these inconveniences may be avoided by immersing 12 parts\r\nof powdered almonds in boiling water, whereby the albuminous matters\r\nare coagulated, whereas the amygdalin is dissolved. On then adding\r\nan emulsion of only 1 part of almonds (sweet or bitter), the emulsin\r\ncontained in it will suffice to effect the required decomposition at a\r\ntemperature not exceeding 40° C. In this manner, Pettenkofer obtained\r\nin some experiments performed with small quantities of almonds, as\r\nmuch as 0·9 per cent. of essential oil. In the case alluded to on\r\nthe opposite page, in which 28 cwt. of almonds were treated, the\r\nyield of essential oil amounted to 0·87 per cent. From data obligingly\r\nfurnished to us by Messrs. Herrings and Co. of London, who distill\r\nlarge quantities of almond cake, it appears that the yield of essential\r\noil is very variable. The yearly averages as taken from the books of\r\nthis firm, show that it may be as low as 0·74, or as high as 1·67 per\r\ncent., which, assuming 57 pounds of cake as equivalent to 100 pounds of\r\nalmonds, would represent a percentage from the latter of 0·42 and 0·95\r\nper cent. respectively. Mr. Umney explains this enormous variation as\r\ndue in part to natural variableness in the different kinds of bitter\r\nalmond, and in part to their admixture with sweet almonds. He also\r\nstates that the action of the emulsin on the amygdalin when in contact\r\nwith water, is extremely rapid, and that 200 pounds of almond marc are\r\nthoroughly exhausted by a distillation of only three hours.\r\n\r\nIn the distillation, the hydrocyanic acid and bitter almond oil unite\r\ninto an unstable compound. From this, the acid is gradually set\r\nfree, and partly converted into cyanide of ammonium and formic acid.\r\nSupposing bitter almonds to contain 3·3 per cent. of Amygdalin, they\r\nmust yield 0·2 per cent. of hydrocyanic acid. Pettenkofer obtained by\r\nexperiment as much as 0·25 per cent., Feldhaus (1863) 0·17 per cent.\r\n\r\nSome manufacturers apply bitter almond oil deprived of hydrocyanic\r\nacid, but such purified oil is very prone to oxidation, unless\r\ncarefully deprived of water by being shaken with fused chloride of\r\ncalcium. The sp. gr. of the original oil is 1·061-1·065; that of the\r\npurified oil (according to Umney) 1·049. The purification by the action\r\nof ferrous sulphate and lime, and re-distillation, as recommended by\r\nMaclagan (1853), occasions, we are informed, a loss of about 10 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nBitter almond oil, C₆H₅(COH), being the aldehyde of benzoic acid,\r\nC₆H₅(COOH), is easily converted in that acid by spontaneous or\r\nartificial oxidation. The oil boils at 180°C. and is a little soluble\r\nin water; 300 parts of water dissolve one part of the oil.\r\n\r\nThere are a great number of plants which if crushed, moistened with\r\nwater, and submitted to distillation, yield both bitter almond oil and\r\nhydrocyanic acid. In many instances the amount of hydrocyanic acid is\r\nso extremely small, that its presence can only be revealed by the most\r\ndelicate test,—that of Schönbein.[956]\r\n\r\nAmong plants capable of emitting hydrocyanic acid, probably always\r\naccompanied with bitter almond oil, the tribes _Pruneæ_ and _Pomeæ_ of\r\nthe rosaceous order may be particularly mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe farinaceous rootstocks of the Bitter Cassava, _Manihot utilissima_,\r\nPohl, of the order _Euphorbiaceæ_, the source of tapioca in Brazil,\r\nhave long been known to yield hydrocyanic acid.\r\n\r\nA composite, _Chardinia xeranthemoides_ Desf., growing in the Caspian\r\nregions, has been shown by W. Eichler also to emit hydrocyanic\r\nacid.[957] The same has been observed by the French in Gaboon[958] with\r\nregard to the fruits of _Ximenia americana_ L. of the order _Olacineæ_,\r\nand the fact has been confirmed by Ernst of Caracas,[959] near which\r\nplace the plant abounds. Mr. Prestoe of the Botanical Garden, Trinidad,\r\ninforms us (1874) that in that island a convolvulaceous plant, _Ipomœa\r\ndissecta_ Willd., contains a juice with a strong prussic acid odour.\r\nAccording to Lösecke, a common mushroom, _Agaricus oreades_ Bolt.,\r\nemits hydrocyanic acid.[960]\r\n\r\n[956] Applied in the following manner:—Let bibulous paper be imbued\r\nwith a fresh tincture of the wood or resin of guaiacum, and after\r\ndrying, let it be moistened with a solution composed of one part of\r\nsulphate of copper in 2000 of water. Such paper moistened with water\r\nwill assume an intense blue coloration in the presence of hydrocyanic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n[957] _Bull. de la Soc. imp. des nat. de Moscou_, xxxv.

Yet amygdalin has thus far only been isolated from a few\r\nplants belonging to the genus _Prunus_ or its near allies.[961] In\r\nall other plants in which hydrocyanic acid has been met with, we know\r\nnothing as to its origin. Ritthausen and Kreusler (1871) have proved\r\nthe _absence_ of amygdalin in the seeds of a _Vicia_, which yield\r\nbitter almond oil and hydrocyanic acid. These chemists followed the\r\nprocess which in the case of bitter almonds easily affords amygdalin.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—See preceding article.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Bitter almonds are used almost exclusively for the manufacture\r\nof _Almond Oil_, while from the residual cake is distilled _Bitter\r\nAlmond Oil_. An emulsion of bitter almonds is sometimes prescribed as a\r\nlotion.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The adulteration of bitter almonds with sweet is a\r\nfrequent source of loss and annoyance to the pressers of almond oil,\r\nwhose profit largely depends on the amount of volatile oil they are\r\nable to extract from the residual cake.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS PRUNI.\r\n\r\n_Prunes_; F. _Pruneaux à médecine_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Prunus domestica_ L., var. ζ. _Juliana_ DC.—It is\r\nfrom this tree, which is known as _Prunier de St. Julien_,[962] that\r\nthe true _Medicinal Prunes_ of English pharmacy are derived. The tree\r\nis largely cultivated in the valley of the Loire in France, especially\r\nabout Bourgueil, a small town lying between Tours and Angers.\r\n\r\n=History=—The plum-tree (_P. domestica_ L.) from which it is supposed\r\nthe numerous cultivated varieties have descended, is believed to occur\r\nin a truly wild state in Greece, the south-eastern shores of the Black\r\nSea (Lazistan), the Caucasus, and the Elburz range in Northern Persia,\r\nfrom some of which countries it was introduced into Europe long before\r\nthe Christian era. In the days of Pliny, numerous species of plum were\r\nalready in cultivation, one of which afforded a fruit having laxative\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nDried prunes, especially those taking their name from Damascus (_Pruna\r\nDamascena_), are frequently mentioned in the writings of the Greek\r\nphysicians, by whom as well as at a later period by the practitioners\r\nof the Schola Salernitana, they were much employed.\r\n\r\n[961] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, vii. 389; xv. 422.\r\n\r\n[962] Loiseleur-Deslongchamps et Michel, _Nouveau Duhamel, ou Traité\r\ndes arbres et arbustes que l’on cultive en France_, v. (1812) 189, pl.\r\n54. fig. 2, pl. 56. fig. 9.\r\n\r\nIn the older London pharmacopœias, many sorts of plum are enumerated,\r\nbut in the reformed editions of 1746, 1788, and 1809, the French Prune\r\n(_Prunum Gallicum_) is specially ordered, its chief use being as an\r\ningredient of the well-known _Lenitive Electuary_; and this fruit\r\nis still held by the grocers to be the legitimate _prune_. The same\r\nvariety is regarded in France as the prune of medicine.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The prune in its fresh state is an ovoid drupe of a deep\r\npurple hue, not depressed at the insertion of the stalk, and with\r\na scarcely visible suture, and no furrow. The pulp is greenish and\r\nrather austere, unless the fruit is very ripe; it does not adhere to\r\nthe stone. The stone is short (⁷/₁₀ to ⁸/₁₀ of an inch long, ⁵/₁₀ to\r\n⁶/₁₀ broad), broadly rounded at the upper end and slightly mucronulate,\r\nnarrowed somewhat stalk-like at the lower, and truncate; the ventral\r\nsuture is broader and thicker than the dorsal.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is dried partly by solar and partly by fire-heat, that is to\r\nsay, it is exposed alternately to the heat of an oven and to the open\r\nair. Thus prepared, it is about 1¼ inches long, black and shrivelled,\r\nbut recovers its original size and form by digestion in warm water.\r\nThe dried pulp or sarcocarp is brown and tough, with an acidulous,\r\nsaccharine, fruity taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The skin of the prune is formed of small,\r\ndensely packed cells, loaded with a dark solid substance; the pulp\r\nconsists of larger shrunken cells, containing a brownish amorphous mass\r\nwhich is probably rich in sugar. This latter tissue is traversed by a\r\nfew thin fibro-vascular bundles, and exhibits here and there crystals\r\nof oxalate of calcium. By perchloride of iron, the cell-walls, as well\r\nas the contents of the cells, acquire a dingy greenish hue.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—We are not aware of any analysis having been\r\nmade of the particular sort of plum under notice, nor that any attempt\r\nhas been made to discover the source of the medicinal property it is\r\nreputed to possess. Some nearly allied varieties have been submitted\r\nto analysis in the laboratory of Fresenius, and shown to contain\r\nsaccharine matters to the extent of 17 to 35 per cent., besides malic\r\nacid, and albuminoid and pectic substances.[963]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The only pharmaceutical preparation of which the pulp of prunes\r\nis an ingredient, is _Confectio Sennæ_, the _Electuarium lenitivum_ of\r\nthe old pharmacopœias. The fruit stewed and sweetened is often used as\r\na domestic laxative.\r\n\r\n=Substitute=—When French prunes are scarce, a very similar fruit,\r\nknown in Germany as _Zwetschen_ or _Quetschen_, is imported as a\r\nsubstitute.[964] It is the produce of a tree which most botanists\r\nregard as a form of _Prunus domestica_ L., termed by De Candolle var.\r\n_Pruneauliana_. K. Koch,[965] however, is decidedly of opinion that it\r\nis a distinct species, and as such he has revived for it Borkhausen’s\r\nname of _Prunus œconomica_. The tree is widely cultivated in Germany\r\nfor the sake of its fruit, which is used in the dried state as an\r\narticle of food, but is not grown in England.\r\n\r\n[963] Liebig’s _Ann. der Chemie_, ci. (1857) 228.\r\n\r\n[964] This was especially the case in the winter of 1873-74.\r\n\r\n[965] _Dendrologie_, part i. (1869) 94.\r\n\r\nThe dried fruit differs slightly from the ordinary prune in being\r\nrather larger and more elongated, and having a thicker skin; also\r\nin the stone being flatter, narrower, pointed at either end, with\r\nthe ventral suture much more strongly curved than the dorsal. The\r\nfruits seem rather more prone to become covered with a saccharine\r\nefflorescence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTEX PRUNI SEROTINÆ.\r\n\r\n_Cortex Pruni Virginianæ_; _Wild Black Cherry Bark_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Prunus serotina_ Ehrhart (_P. virginiana_ Miller\r\nnon Linn., _Cerasus serotina_ DC.)—A shrub or tree, in favourable\r\nsituations growing to a height of 60 feet, distributed over an immense\r\nextent of North America. It is found throughout Canada as far as 62°\r\nN. lat., and from Newfoundland and Hudson’s Bay in the east, to the\r\nvalleys west of the Rocky Mountains.[966] It is also common in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe tree is often confounded with _P. virginiana_ L., from which,\r\nindeed, it seems to be separated by no fixed character, though American\r\nbotanists hold the two plants as distinct. It is also nearly allied to\r\nthe well-known _P. Padus_ L. of Europe, the bark of which had formerly\r\na place in the Materia Medica.\r\n\r\n=History=—Experiments on the medicinal value of Wild Cherry Bark were\r\nmade in America about the end of the last century, at which time\r\nthe drug was supposed to be useful in intermittent fevers.[967] The\r\nbark was introduced into the _United States Pharmacopœia_ in 1820.\r\nAn elaborate article by Bentley[968] published in 1863 contributed\r\nto bring it into notice in this country, but it is still much more\r\nemployed in America than with us.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The inner bark of the root or branches is said to be the\r\nmost suitable for medicinal use. That which we have seen is evidently\r\nfrom the latter; it is in flattish or channelled pieces, ⅒ to ¹/₂₀ of\r\nan inch in thickness, ½ an inch to 2 inches broad, and seldom exceeding\r\n5 inches in length. From many of the pieces, the outer suberous coat\r\nhas been shaved off, in which case the whole bark is of a deep cinnamon\r\nbrown; in others the corky layer remains, exhibiting a polished satiny\r\nsurface, marked with long transverse scars. The inner surface is finely\r\nstriated, or minutely fissured and reticulated. The bark breaks easily\r\nwith a short granular fracture; it is nearly without smell, but if\r\nreduced to coarse powder and wetted with water it evolves a pleasant\r\nodour of bitter almonds. It has a decided but transient bitter taste.\r\n\r\nThe bark freshly cut from the stem is quite white, and has a strong\r\nodour of bitter almonds and hydrocyanic acid.\r\n\r\n[966] Hooker, _Flora Boreali-Americana_, i.

(1864) 67.—Also Bentley and Trimen, _Med.\r\nPlants_, part 3; (1878).\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The chief mass of the tissue is made up of\r\nhard, thick-walled, white cells, the groups of which are separated\r\nby a brown fibrous prosenchyme. The liber is crossed in a radial\r\ndirection by numerous broad medullary rays of the usual structure. The\r\nparenchymatous portion is loaded both with very large single crystals,\r\nand crystalline tufts of calcium oxalate. There is also an abundance\r\nof small starch granules, and brown particles of tannic matters.\r\nThin slices of the bark moistened with perchloride of iron, assume a\r\nblackish coloration.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The bitterness and odour of the fresh bark\r\ndepend no doubt on the presence of a substance analogous to amygdalin,\r\nwhich has not yet been examined. Hydrocyanic acid and essential oil are\r\nproduced when the bark is distilled with water, and must be due to the\r\nmutual action of that substance alluded to, and some principle of the\r\nnature of emulsin. From the fact that an extract of the bark remained\r\nbitter although the whole of the essential oil and hydrocyanic acid had\r\nbeen removed, Proctor inferred the existence of another substance to\r\nwhich the tonic properties of the bark are perhaps due.\r\n\r\nThe fresh bark was found by Perot[969] to yield ½ per mille of\r\nhydrocyanic acid in April, 1 per mille in June, and 1·4 in October. The\r\nbest time for collecting the bark is therefore the autumn.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—In America, wild cherry bark is held in high estimation for\r\nits mildly tonic and sedative properties. It is administered most\r\nappropriately in the form of cold infusion or syrup, the latter being\r\na strong cold infusion, sweetened; a fluid extract and a dry resinoid\r\nextract are also in use. The bark is said to deteriorate by keeping,\r\nand should be preferred when recently dried.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLIA LAURO-CERASI.\r\n\r\n_Common Laurel or Cherry-laurel Leaves_; F. _Feuilles de\r\nLaurier-cerise_; G. _Kirschlorbeerblätter_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Prunus Lauro-cerasus_ L., a handsome evergreen\r\nshrub, growing to the height of 18 or more feet, is a native of the\r\nCaucasian provinces of Russia (Mingrelia, Imeritia, Guriel), of the\r\nvalleys of North-western Asia Minor, and Northern Persia. It has been\r\nintroduced as a plant of ornament into all the more temperate regions\r\nof Europe, and flourishes well in England and other parts, where the\r\nwinter is not severe and the summer not excessively hot and dry.\r\n\r\n=History=—Pierre Belon, the French naturalist, who travelled in\r\nthe East between 1546 and 1550, is stated by Clusius[970] to have\r\ndiscovered the cherry-laurel in the neighbourhood of Trebizond. Thirty\r\nyears later, Clusius himself obtained the plant through the Imperial\r\nambassador at Constantinople, and distributed it from Vienna to the\r\ngardens of Germany. Since it is mentioned by Gerarde[971] as a choice\r\ngarden shrub, it must have been cultivated in England prior to 1597.\r\nRay,[972] who like Gerarde calls the plant _Cherry-bay_, states that it\r\nis not known to possess medicinal properties.\r\n\r\n[969] _Pharm.

(1693) 1549.\r\n\r\nIn 1731, Madden of Dublin drew the attention of the Royal Society of\r\nLondon[973] to some cases of poisoning that had occurred by the use of\r\na distilled water of the leaves. This water he states had been for many\r\nyears in frequent use in Ireland among cooks, for flavouring puddings\r\nand creams, and also much in vogue with dram drinkers as an addition to\r\nbrandy, without any ill effects from it having been noticed. The fatal\r\ncases thus brought forward occasioned much investigation, but the true\r\nnature of the poison was not understood till pointed out by Schrader in\r\n1803 (see art. Amygdalæ amaræ, p. 248, note 2). Cherry-laurel water,\r\nthough long used on the Continent, has never been much prescribed in\r\nGreat Britain, and had no place in any British Pharmacopœia till 1839.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The leaves are alternate, simple, of leathery texture\r\nand shining upper surface, 5 to 6 inches long by 1¾ to 2 inches wide,\r\noblong or slightly obovate, attenuated towards either end. The thick\r\nleafstalk, scarcely half an inch in length, is prolonged as a stout\r\nmidrib to the recurved apex. The margin, which is also recurved, is\r\nprovided with sharp but very short serratures, and glandular teeth,\r\nwhich become more distant towards the base. The under side, which is of\r\na paler colour and dull surface, is marked by 8 or 10 lateral veins,\r\nanastomosing towards the edge. Below the lower of these and close to\r\nthe midrib, are from two to four shallow depressions or _glands_, which\r\nin spring exude a saccharine matter, and soon assume a brownish colour.\r\nBy the glands with which the teeth of the serratures are provided, a\r\nrather resinous substance is secreted.[974]\r\n\r\nThe fresh leaves are inodorous until they are bruised or torn, when\r\nthey instantly emit the smell of bitter almond oil and hydrocyanic\r\nacid. When chewed they taste rough, aromatic and bitter.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The upper surface of the leaf is constituted of\r\nthin cuticle and the epidermis made up of large, nearly cubic cells.\r\nThe middle layer of the interior tissue exhibits densely packed small\r\ncells, whereas the prevailing part of the whole tissue is formed of\r\nlarger, loose cells. Most of them are loaded with chlorophyll; some\r\nenclose crystals of oxalate of calcium.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The leaves when cut to pieces and submitted to\r\ndistillation with water, yield _Bitter Almond Oil_ and _Hydrocyanic\r\nAcid_, produced by the decomposition of _Laurocerasin_. This is\r\nan amorphous yellowish substance isolated by Lehmann (1874) in\r\nDragendorff’s laboratory. He extracted the leaves with boiling alcohol,\r\nand purified the liquid by gently warming it with hydroxide of lead.\r\nFrom the liquid, crude laurocerasin was precipitated on addition of\r\nether; it was again dissolved repeatedly in alcohol and precipitated\r\nby ether. The yield of the leaves is about 1⅓ per cent. Laurocerasin\r\nis readily soluble in water, the solution deviates the plane of\r\npolarization to the left, yet not to the same amount as amygdalin. The\r\nmolecule of laurocerasin, C₄₀H₆₇NO₃₀, would appear to include those of\r\namygdalin, C₂₀H₂₇NO₁₁, amygdalic acid, C₂₀H₂₆O₁₂ and 7 OH₂.\r\n\r\n[973] _Phil. Trans._ xxxvii. (for 1731-32) 84.\r\n\r\n[974] Reinke, in Pringsheim’s _Jahrbücher für wissenschaftliche\r\nBotanik_, x. (1875) 129.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of hydrocyanic acid in the distilled water of the leaves\r\nhas been the subject of many researches. Among the later are those of\r\nBroeker (1867), who distilled a given weight of the leaves grown in\r\nHolland under precisely similar circumstances, in each month of the\r\nyear. The results proved that the product obtained during the winter\r\nand early spring was weaker in the acid in the proportion of 17 to\r\n24, 28, or 30, the strongest water being that distilled in July and\r\nAugust. This chemist found that a stronger product was got when the\r\nleaves were chopped fine, than when they were used whole. According\r\nto Christison,[975] the buds and very young leaves yield ten times as\r\nmuch essential oil as the leaves one year old. We have ascertained that\r\nleaves collected in January when they were thoroughly frozen yielded a\r\ndistillate containing about ten times less of hydrocyanic acid than in\r\nsummer. The product obtained from the leaves collected in January, but\r\npreviously dried for several days at 100° C. (212° F.), still proved to\r\ncontain both essential oil and hydrocyanic acid.\r\n\r\nThe unwounded leaves of the cherry-laurel in vigorous vegetation have\r\nbeen shown by our friend Prof. Schaer, not to evolve naturally a trace\r\nof hydrocyanic acid, though they yield it on the slightest puncture.\r\nWe are ignorant of the mode of distribution in the living tissue of\r\nthe laurocerasin, and of the substances causing its decomposition, and\r\nhow these two bodies are packed so as to prevent the slightest mutual\r\nreaction. The leaves may be even dried at 100° C. and powdered without\r\nthe evolution of any odour of hydrocyanic acid, but the latter is at\r\nonce developed by the addition of a little water; on distilling its\r\npresence is proved by means of all the usual tests in the first drops\r\nof the product.\r\n\r\nBesides the substances concerned in the production of the essential\r\noil, the leaves contain sugar which reduces cupric oxide in the cold,\r\na small quantity of an iron-greening tannin, and a fatty or waxy\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nSchoonbroodt (1868) treated the aqueous extract of the fresh leaves\r\nwith alcoholic ether, which yielded ¼ per mille of bitter, acicular\r\ncrystals; these quickly reduced cupric oxide, losing their bitterness.\r\n\r\nBougarel (1877) isolated from the leaves under notice and several\r\nothers, _Phyllinic acid_, a crystalline powder melting at 170° C.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The leaves are only employed for making cherry-laurel water\r\n(_Aqua Lauro-cerasi_), the use of which in England is generally\r\nsuperseded by that of the more definite hydrocyanic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORES KOSO.\r\n\r\n_Flores Brayeræ_, _Cusso_, _Kousso_, _Kosso_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Hagenia abyssinica_ Willd. (_Brayera\r\nanthelminthica_ Kunth), a handsome tree growing to a height of 60 feet,\r\nfound throughout the entire table-land of Abyssinia at an elevation of\r\n3,000 to 8,000 feet above the sea-level.[976] We have never noticed\r\nit growing in any botanic garden. The tree[977] is remarkable for its\r\nabundant foliage and fine panicles of flowers, and is generally planted\r\nabout the Abyssinian villages.\r\n\r\n[975] _Dispensatory_, 1842. 592.\r\n\r\n[976] The French section of the International African Association\r\ncontributed Kousso from _Madagascar_ to the Paris Exhibition of 1878.\r\n\r\n[977] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med. Plants_, part 5 (1876).\r\n\r\n=History=—The celebrated Bruce[978] during his journey to discover\r\nthe source of the Nile, 1768-1773, found the koso tree in Abyssinia,\r\nobserved the uses made of it by the natives, and published a figure\r\nof it in the narrative of his travels. It was also described in 1799\r\nby Willdenow who called it _Hagenia_ in honour of Dr. K. G. Hagen of\r\nKönigsberg.\r\n\r\nThe anthelmintic virtues of koso were investigated by Brayer, a French\r\nphysician of Constantinople, to which place parcels of the drug are\r\noccasionally brought by way of Egypt, and he published a small pamphlet\r\non the subject.[979] Several scattered notices of koso appeared in\r\n1839-41, but no supply of it reached Europe until about 1850, when a\r\nFrenchman who had been in Abyssinia obtained a large stock (1,400 lb.,\r\nit was said), a portion of which he endeavoured to sell in London at\r\n35_s._ _per ounce_! The absurd value set upon the drug produced the\r\nusual result: large quantities were imported, and the price gradually\r\nfell to 3_s._ or 4_s._ per lb. Koso was admitted a place in the British\r\nPharmacopœia of 1864.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The flowers grow in broad panicles, 10 to 12 inches in\r\nlength. They are unisexual, but though male and female occur on the\r\nsame tree, the latter are chiefly collected. The panicles are either\r\nloosely dried, often including a portion of stalk and sometimes a leaf,\r\nor they are made into cylindrical rolls, kept in form by transverse\r\nligatures. Very often the panicles arrive quite broken up, and with\r\nthe flowers in a very fragmentary state. They have a herby, somewhat\r\ntea-like smell, and a bitterish acrid taste.\r\n\r\nThe panicle consists of a zigzag stalk, which with its many branches\r\nis clothed with shaggy simple hairs, and also dotted over with minute\r\nstalked glands; it is provided at each ramification with a large\r\nsheathing bract. At the base of each flower are two or three rounded\r\nveiny membranous bracts, between which is the turbinate hairy calyx,\r\nhaving ten sepals arranged in a double series. In the male, the outer\r\nseries consists of much smaller sepals than the inner; in the female,\r\nthe outer in the ultimate development become enlarged, obovate and\r\nspreading, so that the whole flower measures fully ½ an inch across.\r\nIn both, the sepals are veiny and leaf-like. The petals are minute and\r\nlinear, inserted with the stamens in the throat of the calyx. These\r\nlatter are 10 to 25 in number, with anthers in the female flower,\r\neffete. The carpels are two, included in the calycinal tube; and each\r\nsurmounted by a hairy style. The fruit is an obovate one-seeded nut.\r\n\r\nKoso as seen in commerce has a light brown hue, with a reddish tinge\r\nin the case of the female flowers, so that panicles of the latter are\r\nsometimes distinguished as _Red Koso_.\r\n\r\n[978] Travels, v.

Med._ ii. part 2 (1853) 1815.—Also\r\nMeyer-Ahrens, _Die Blüthen des Kossobaumes_, Zürich, 1851. 90 pp.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Wittstein (1840) found in koso, together with\r\nthe substances common to most vegetables (wax, sugar, and gum), 24 per\r\ncent. of tannin, and 6·25 of an acrid bitter resin, which was observed\r\nby Harms (1857) to possess acid properties.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Pavesi (1858), and still more those of Bedall[980]\r\nhave made us acquainted with the active principle of the drug, which\r\nhas been named _Koussin_ or _Kosin_. It may be obtained by mixing the\r\nflowers with lime, exhausting them with alcohol and then with water;\r\nthe solutions mixed, concentrated, and treated with acetic acid,\r\ndeposit the kosin. We are indebted to Dr. Bedall for a specimen of it,\r\nwhich we find to consist chiefly of an amorphous, resinoid substance,\r\nfrom which we got a few yellow crystals by means of glacial acetic acid.\r\n\r\nMr. Merck favoured us with kosin prepared in his laboratory at\r\nDarmstadt. It is a tasteless substance of a yellow colour, forming fine\r\ncrystals of the rhombic system,—readily soluble in benzol, bisulphide\r\nof carbon, chloroform or ether, less freely in glacial acetic acid,\r\nand insoluble in water. We found a solution of kosin in 20 parts of\r\nchloroform to be destitute of rotatory power. Of alcohol, sp. gr.\r\n0·818, 1000 parts dissolve at 12° C. only 2·3 parts of this kosin.\r\nIt is abundantly soluble in alkalis, caustic or carbonated, yet has\r\nnevertheless no acid reaction, and may be precipitated from these\r\nsolutions by an acid without having undergone any alteration. It is\r\nthen however a white amorphous mass, which yields the original yellow\r\ncrystals by re-solution in boiling alcohol, in which it dissolves\r\nreadily. The analysis which we have performed of kosin assigns it the\r\nformula C₃₁H₃₈O₁₀.\r\n\r\nKosin fuses at 142° C., and remains after cooling an amorphous,\r\ntransparent yellow mass; but if touched with alcohol, it immediately\r\nassumes the form of stellate tufts of crystals. This may be repeated at\r\npleasure, kosin not being altered by cautious fusion.\r\n\r\nKosin is not decomposed by boiling dilute acids. It dissolves in strong\r\nsulphuric acid, giving a yellow solution which becomes turbid by the\r\naddition of water, white amorphous kosin being thrown down. At the\r\nsame time a well-marked odour exactly like that of Locust Beans, due\r\nto isobutyric acid, CH₃·CH₃·CH·COOH, is evolved. It would thus appear\r\nthat in all probability kosin is a compound ether of that acid. It is\r\nvery remarkable that the active principle of fern root, the filicic\r\nacid (see Rhizoma Filicis), by decomposition yields butyric acid. If\r\nthe sulphuric solution of kosin is allowed to stand for a week, it\r\ngradually assumes a fine red; and then yields, on addition of much\r\nwater, an amorphous red mass which after drying is not soluble in\r\nbisulphide of carbon, and may thus be purified. We have not succeeded\r\nin obtaining this red derivative of kosin in a crystalline state.[981]\r\n\r\nIn its anthelmintic action, kosin is nearly allied with filicic\r\nacid.[982]\r\n\r\nDistillation with water separates from the flowers of koso a\r\nstearoptene-like oil having the odour of koso, and traces of valerianic\r\nand acetic acid. No such body as the _Hagenic Acid_ of Viale and Latini\r\n(1852) could be detected by Bedall.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Koso is brought to England by way of Aden or Bombay; some\r\nappears also to reach Leghorn, probably carried thither direct from\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n[980] Wittstein’s _Vierteljahresschrift für prakt.

Th. von Heuglin[984] to act even more powerful than the flowers;\r\nhe calls it (or the seed?) Kosála. It would appear that the fruits\r\nhave been used as an anthelmintic two centuries ago in Abyssinia.[985]\r\nDragendorff (1878) found them to be rich in fatty matters, but devoid\r\nof an alkaloid.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETALA ROSÆ GALLICÆ.\r\n\r\n_Flores Rosæ rubræ_; _Red Rose Petals_, _Rose Leaves_, _True Provins\r\nRoses_; F. _Pétales de Roses rouges_, _Roses de Provins_; G.\r\n_Essigrosenblätter_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Rosa gallica_ L., a low-growing bush, with a\r\ncreeping rhizome throwing up numerous stems. The wild form with single\r\nflowers occurs here and there in the warmer parts of Europe,[986]\r\nincluding Central and Southern Russia, and Greece; also in Asia Minor,\r\nArmenia, Kurdistan, and the Caucasus. But the plant passes into so many\r\nvarieties, and has from a remote period been so widely cultivated, that\r\nits distribution cannot be ascertained with any exactness. As a garden\r\nplant it exists under a multitude of forms.\r\n\r\n=History=—The use in medicine of the rose dates from a very remote\r\nperiod. Theophrastus[987] speaks of roses being of many kinds,\r\nincluding some with double flowers which were the most fragrant; and\r\nhe also alludes to their use in the healing art. Succeeding writers\r\nof every age down to a recent period have discussed the virtues of\r\nthe rose,[988] which however is scarcely now admitted to possess any\r\nspecial medicinal property.\r\n\r\n[983] Johnston in his _Travels in Southern Abyssinia_ (1844), speaking\r\nof koso, says its effects are “_dreadfully severe_.”—Even in Abyssinia,\r\nhe adds, it is barely tolerated, and if any other remedy equally\r\nefficient for dislodging tapeworm were to be introduced, koso would be\r\nsoon abandoned.\r\n\r\n[984] _Reise nach Abessinien_, etc. Jena, 1868. 322.\r\n\r\n[985] Jobi Ludolfi _Historia æthiopica_, Francofurti, 1681. lib. i.\r\ncap. ix.\r\n\r\n[986] It has been found in _quasi_-wild state at Charlwood in\r\nSurrey.—_Seemann’s Journ. of Bot._ ix.

But it appears that he went then to\r\nNavarre and in later times never resided in the Champagne. Be this as\r\nit may, Provins became much celebrated not only for its dried rose\r\npetals, but also for the conserve, syrup and honey of roses made\r\nfrom them,—compositions which were regarded in the light of valuable\r\nmedicines.[989]\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that when, in A.D. 1310, Philippe de Marigny, archbishop\r\nof Sens, made a solemn entry into Provins, he was presented by the\r\nnotables of the town with wine, spices, and _Conserve of Roses_; and\r\npresents of dried roses and of the conserve were not considered beneath\r\nthe notice of Catherine de Medicis, and of Henry IV.[990]\r\n\r\nWe find that Charles Estienne, in 1536, mentions both the _Rosæ\r\npurpureæ odoratissimæ_, which he says are called _Provinciales_, and\r\nthose known to the druggists as _incarnatæ_,—the latter we presume a\r\n_pale_ rose.[991] _Rosæ rubeæ_ are named as an ingredient of various\r\ncompound medicines by Valerius Cordus.[992]\r\n\r\n=Production=—The flowers are gathered while in bud and just before\r\nexpansion, and the petals are cut off near the base, leaving the paler\r\nclaws attached to the calyx. They are then carefully and rapidly dried\r\nby the heat of a stove, and having been gently sifted to remove loose\r\nstamens, are ready for sale. In some districts the petals are dried\r\nentire, but the drug thus produced is not so nice.\r\n\r\nIn England, the Red Rose is cultivated at Mitcham, though now only to\r\nthe extent of about 10 acres. It is also grown for druggists’ use in\r\nOxfordshire and Derbyshire. At Mitcham, it is now called _Damask Rose_,\r\nwhich is by no means a correct name. The English dried roses command a\r\nhigh price.\r\n\r\nThere is a much more extensive cultivation of this rose on the\r\ncontinent at Wassenaar and Noordwijk in Holland; in the vicinity of\r\nHamburg and Nuremberg in Germany, and in the villages round Paris and\r\nLyons. Roses are still, we believe, grown for medicinal use at Provins,\r\nbut are no longer held in great esteem.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be a considerable production of dried roses in Persia,\r\njudging from the fact that in the year 1871-72, 1163 cwt. were exported\r\nfrom the Persian Gulf to Bombay.[993]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The petals adhere together loosely in the form of little\r\ncones, or are more or less crumpled and separate. When well preserved,\r\nthey are crisp and dry, with a velvety surface of an intense purplish\r\ncrimson, a delicious rosy odour, and a mildly astringent taste. The\r\nwhite basal portion of the petals should be nearly absent. For making\r\nthe confection, the petals are required in a fresh state.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Red rose petals impart to ether, without losing\r\ntheir colour, a soft yellow substance, which is a mixture of a solid\r\nfat and _Quercitrin_. Filhol has shown (1864) that it is the latter\r\nbody, and not tannic acid, of which the petals contain but a trace,\r\nthat produces the dark greenish precipitate with ferric salts. The same\r\nchemist found in the petals 20 per cent. (?) of glucose which, together\r\nwith colouring matter and gallic acid, is extracted by alcohol after\r\nexhaustion by ether. According to Rochleder (1867), the gallic acid in\r\nred roses is accompanied by querci-tannic acid.\r\n\r\n[989] Pomet, _Hist. des Drogues_, 1694, part i. 174-177, speaks of the\r\nroses of Provins being “hautes en couleur, c’est à dire d’un rouge\r\nnoir, velouté ... très astringentes.”\r\n\r\n[990] Assier, _Légendes, curiosités et traditions de la Champagne et de\r\nla Brie_, Paris. 1860. 191.\r\n\r\n[991] Stephanus (Carolus), _De re hortens libellus_, Paris, 1536. 29\r\n(in Brit.

An alkali changes the pale red, or the deep crimson in the\r\ncase of the acidulated infusion, to bright green.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—An infusion of red rose petals, acidulated with sulphuric acid\r\nand slightly sweetened, is a very common and agreeable vehicle for some\r\nother medicines. The confection made by beating up the petals with\r\nsugar, is also in use.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETALA ROSÆ CENTIFOLIÆ.\r\n\r\n_Flores Rosæ pallidæ v. incarnatæ_; _Provence Rose_, _Cabbage Rose_; F.\r\n_Pétales de Roses pâles_; G. _Centifolienrosen_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Rosa centifolia_ L.—This rose grows in a wild state\r\nand with single flowers in the eastern part of the Caucasus.[995]\r\nCultivated and with flowers more or less double, it is found under an\r\ninfinity of varieties in all the temperate regions of the globe. The\r\nparticular variety which is grown in England for medicinal use, is\r\nknown in English gardens as the _Cabbage Rose_, but other varieties are\r\ncultivated for similar purposes on the Continent.\r\n\r\n_R. centifolia_ L. is very closely allied to _R. gallica_ L.; though\r\nBoissier maintains the two species, there are other botanists who\r\nregard them as but one. The rose cultivated at Puteaux near Paris\r\nfor druggists’ use, and hence called _Rose de Puteaux_, is the _Rosa\r\nbifera_ of Redouté, placed by De Candolle though doubtfully under _R.\r\ndamascena_.\r\n\r\n=History=—We are unable to trace the history of the particular variety\r\nof rose under notice. That it is not of recent origin, seems evident\r\nfrom its occurrence chiefly in old gardens. The _Rosa pallida_ of the\r\nolder English writers on drugs[996] was called _Damask Rose_, but that\r\nname is now applied at Mitcham to _Rosa gallica_ L., which has very\r\ndeep-coloured flowers.\r\n\r\n=Production=—The Cabbage Rose is cultivated in England to a very small\r\nextent, rose water, which is made from its flowers, being procurable\r\nof better quality and at a lower cost in other countries, especially\r\nin the south of France. At Mitcham, whence the London druggists have\r\nlong been supplied, there are now (1873) only about 8 acres planted\r\nwith this rose, but a supply is also derived from the market gardens of\r\nPutney, Hammersmith and Fulham.\r\n\r\n[994] _Yearbook of Pharm._ 1877. 63; also Filhol in _Journ. de Pharm._\r\nxxxviii.

A\r\ncomplete description is scarcely required: we need only say that it\r\nis a large and very double rose, of a beautiful pink colour and of\r\ndelicious odour. The calyx is covered with short setæ tipped with a\r\nfragrant, brown, viscid secretion. The petals are thin and delicate\r\n(not thick and leathery as in the Tea Roses), and turn brown on drying.\r\n\r\nIn making rose water, it is the custom in some laboratories to strip\r\nthe petals from the calyx and to reject the latter; in others, the\r\nroses are distilled entire, and so far as we have observed, with\r\nequally good result.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—In a chemical point of view, the petals of _R.\r\ncentifolia_ agree with those of _R. gallica_, even as to the colouring\r\nmatter. Enz in 1867 obtained from the former, malic and tartaric acid,\r\ntannin, fat, resin, and sugar.\r\n\r\nIn the distillation of large quantities of the flowers, a little\r\nessential oil is obtained. It is a butyraceous substance, of weak\r\nrose-like, but not very agreeable odour. It contains a large proportion\r\nof inodorous stearoptene. For further particulars see remarks under the\r\nhead _Attar of Rose_.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Cabbage roses are now scarcely employed in pharmacy for any\r\nother purpose than making rose water. A syrup used to be prepared from\r\nthem, which was esteemed a mild laxative.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLEUM ROSÆ.\r\n\r\n_Attar or Otto[997] of Rose_, _Rose Oil_; F. _Essence de Roses_; G.\r\n_Rosenöl_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Rosa damascena_ Miller, var.—This is the rose\r\ncultivated in Turkey for the production of attar of rose; it is a tall\r\nshrub with semi-double, light-red (rarely white) flowers, of moderate\r\nsize, produced several on a branch, though not in clusters. Living\r\nspecimens sent by Baur[998] which flowered at Tübingen, were examined\r\nby H. von Mohl and named as above.[999]\r\n\r\n_R. damascena_ is unknown in a wild state. Koch[1000] asserts that\r\nit was brought in remote times to Southern Italy, whence it spread\r\nnorthward. In the opinion of Baker[1001] Rosa damascena is to be\r\nreferred to Rosa gallica (see p. 259 above); it must be granted that\r\nthe Rose mentioned in footnote 2, as grown with one of us, approaches\r\nvery much to Rosa gallica.\r\n\r\n=History=—Much as roses were prized by the ancients, no preparation\r\nsuch as rose water or attar of rose was obtained from them. The\r\nliquid that bore the name of _Rose Oil_ (ῤόδινον ἔλαιον) is stated by\r\nDioscorides[1002] to be a fatty oil in which roses have been steeped.\r\nIn Europe a similar preparation was in use down to the last century,\r\n_Oleum rosarum_, _rosatum_ or _rosaceum_, signifying an infusion of\r\nroses in olive oil in the _London Pharmacopœia_ of 1721.\r\n\r\n[997] _Attar_ or _Otto_ is from the word _itr_ signifying _perfume_ or\r\n_odour_; the oil is called in Turkish _Itr-yàghi_ i.e. _Perfume-oil_,\r\nand also _Ghyùl-yàghi_ i.e. _Rose oil_.\r\n\r\n[998] A living plant followed by excellent herbarium specimens has been\r\nkindly given to me by Dr. Baur of Blaubeuren, the father of Dr. Baur of\r\nConstantinople—D.

Rose\r\nwater was distilled at an early date in Persia; and Nisibin, a town\r\nnorth-west of Mosul, was famous for it in the 14th century.[1004]\r\n\r\nKämpfer speaks[1005] with admiration of the roses he saw at Shiraz\r\n(1683-4), and says that the water distilled from them is exported\r\nto other parts of Persia, as well as to all India; and he adds as a\r\nsingular fact, that there separates from it a certain fat-like butter,\r\ncalled _Ættr gyl_, of the most exquisite odour, and more valuable even\r\nthan gold. The commerce to India, though much declining, still exists;\r\nand in the year 1872-73, 20,100 gallons of rose water, valued at 35,178\r\nrupees (£3,517), were imported into Bombay from the Persian Gulf.[1006]\r\nRose oil itself is no longer exported from Persia, as it still used to\r\nbe from Shiraz in the time of Niebuhr (1778).\r\n\r\nRose water was much used in Europe during the middle ages, both in\r\ncookery and at the table. In some parts of France, vassals were\r\ncompelled to furnish to their lords so many bushels of roses, which\r\nwere consumed in the distillation of rose water.[1007]\r\n\r\nThe fact that a butyraceous oil of delicious fragrance is separable\r\nfrom rose water, was noticed by Geronimo Rossi[1008] of Ravenna in\r\n1582 (or in 1574?) and by Giovanni Battista Porta[1009] of Naples in\r\n1589; the latter in his work on distillation says—“Omnium difficillime\r\nextractionis est rosarum oleum atque in minima quantitate sed\r\nsuavissimi odoris.”[1010] The oil was also known to the apothecaries\r\nof Germany in the beginning of the 17th century, and is quoted in\r\nofficial drug-tariffs of that time.[1011] Angelus Sala, about 1620, in\r\ndescribing the distillation of the oil speaks of it as being of “ ...\r\ncandicante pinguedine instar Spermatis Ceti.” In Pomet’s time (1694) it\r\nwas sold in Paris, though, on account of its high price, only in very\r\nsmall quantity. The mention of it by Homberg[1012] in 1700, and in a\r\nmemoir by Aublet[1013] (1775) respecting the distillation of roses in\r\nthe Isle of France, shows that the French perfumers of the last century\r\nwere not unacquainted with true rose oil, but that it was a rare and\r\nvery costly article.\r\n\r\nThe history of the discovery of the essence in India, is the subject\r\nof an interesting and learned pamphlet by Langlès,[1014] published\r\nin 1804. He tells us on the authority of oriental writers, how on\r\nthe occasion of the marriage of the Mogul emperor Jehan Ghir with\r\nNur-jehan, A.D. 1612, a canal in the garden of the palace was filled\r\nwith rose water, and that the princess observing a certain scum on the\r\nsurface, caused it to be collected and found it of admirable fragrance,\r\non which account it received the name of _Atar-jehanghiri_, i.e.\r\n_perfume of Jehan Ghir_. In later times, Polier[1015] has shown that\r\nrose oil is prepared in India by simple distillation of the flowers\r\nwith water. But this Indian oil has never been imported into Europe as\r\nan article of trade.\r\n\r\n[1003] “ ... stillatitii rosarum liquoris libra una.” _De Methodo\r\nMedendi_, lib. v. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1004] _Voyage d’Ibn Batoutah_, trad. par Defrémery, ii.

There is no mention of attar in the account given by Savary[1016]\r\nin 1750 of the trade of Constantinople and Smyrna, but in the first\r\nyears of the present century some rose oil was obtained in the Island\r\nof Chios as well as in Persia.[1017]\r\n\r\nIn English commerce, attar of rose was scarcely known until the\r\ncommencement of the present century. It was first included in the\r\nBritish tariff in 1809, when the duty levied on it was 10_s._ per\r\nounce. In 1813 the duty was raised to 11_s._ 10½_d._; in 1819 it\r\nwas 6_s._, and in 1828, 2_s._ per ounce. In 1832 it was lowered to\r\n1_s._ 4_d._ per lb., in 1842 to 1_s._ and in 1860 it was altogether\r\nremoved.[1018]\r\n\r\nOn searching a file of the _London Price Current_, the first mention of\r\n“_Otto of Rose_” is in 1813, from which year it is regularly quoted.\r\nThe price (in bond) from 1813 to 1815, varied from £3 to £5 5_s._ per\r\nounce. The earliest notice of an importation is under date 1-8 July,\r\n1813, when duty was paid on 232 ounces, shipped from Smyrna.\r\n\r\n=Production=—The chief locality for attar of rose, and that by which\r\nEuropean commerce is almost exclusively supplied, is a small tract of\r\ncountry on the southern side of the Balkan mountains, the “Tekne” of\r\nKazanlik or Kisanlik, an undulated plain famous for its beauty, as\r\npicturesquely sketched by Kanitz[1019] and many other travellers. The\r\nprincipal seat of the trade is the town of Kizanlik, in the valley of\r\nthe Tunja. The other important districts are those of Philippopli,\r\nEski Zaghra, Yeni Zaghra, Tchirpan, Giopca, Karadsuh-Dagh, Kojun-Tepe,\r\nPazandsik. North of the Balkans, there is only Travina to be mentioned\r\nas likewise producing attar. All these places with Kizanlik were\r\nestimated in 1859 to include 140 villages, having 2,500 stills.\r\n\r\nThe rose is cultivated by peasants in gardens and open fields, in\r\nwhich it is planted in rows as hedges, 3 to 4 feet high. The best\r\nlocalities are those occupying southern or south-eastern slopes.\r\nPlantations in high mountainous situations generally yield less, and\r\nthe oil is of a quality that easily congeals. The flowers attain\r\nperfection in April and May, and are gathered before sunrise; those\r\nnot wanted for immediate use are spread out in cellars, but are always\r\nused for distilling the same day. The apparatus is a copper still of\r\nthe simplest description, connected with a straight tin tube, cooled\r\nby being passed through a tub fed by a stream of water. The largest\r\nestablishment, “Fabrika,” at Kizanlik has 14 such stills. The charge\r\nfor a still is 25 to 50 lb. of roses, from which the calyces are not\r\nremoved. The first runnings are returned to the still; the second\r\nportion, which is received in glass flasks, is kept at a temperature\r\nnot lower than 15° C. for a day or two, by which time most of the oil,\r\nbright and fluid, will have risen to the surface. From this, it is\r\nskimmed off by means of a small tin funnel having a fine orifice, and\r\nprovided with a long handle. There are usually several stills together.\r\n\r\n[1016] _Dict. de Commerce_, iv. 548.\r\n\r\n[1017] Oliver, _Voyage dans l’Empire Othoman_, etc. ii. (Paris, An 9)\r\n139, v.

A good map of the Tekne of Kizanlik and environs will\r\nbe found in _Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Erdkunde zu Berlin_, xi.\r\n(1876) Taf. 2.\r\n\r\nThe produce is extremely variable. According to Baur,[1020] whose\r\ninteresting account of attar of rose is that of an eye-witness, it\r\nmay be said to average 0·04 per cent. Another authority estimates the\r\naverage yield as 0·037 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe harvest during the five years 1867-71 was reckoned to average\r\nsomewhat below 400,000 _meticals_,[1021] or 4226 lb. avoirdupois; that\r\nof 1873, which was good, was estimated at 500,000 _meticals_, value\r\nabout £70,000.[1022]\r\n\r\nRoses are cultivated to a considerable extent about Grasse, Cannes\r\nand Nice in the south of France; and besides much rose water, which\r\nis largely exported to England, a little oil is produced. The latter,\r\nwhich commands a high price, fuses less easily than the Turkish.\r\n\r\nThere is a large cultivation of the rose for the purpose of making\r\nrose water and attar, at Ghazipur on the Ganges, Lahore, Amritsar\r\nand other places in India, but the produce is wholly consumed in the\r\ncountry. The species thus cultivated is stated by Brandis[1023] to be\r\n_R. damascena_. Medinet Fayum, south-west of Cairo, supplies the great\r\ndemand of Egypt for rose vinegar and rose water.\r\n\r\nTunis has also some celebrity for similar products, which however do\r\nnot reach Europe. A recent traveller[1024] states that the rose grown\r\nthere, and from which attar is obtained, is _Rosa canina_ L., which\r\nis extremely fragrant; 30 lb. of the flowers afford about 1½ drachms,\r\nworth 15_s._ When at Genoa, in 1874, one of us (F.) had the opportunity\r\nof ascertaining that excellent oil of rose is occasionally imported\r\nthere from Tunis.\r\n\r\nThe butyraceous oil which may be collected in distilling roses in\r\nEngland for rose water is of no value as a perfume.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Oil of rose is a light yellow liquid, of sp. gr. 0·87\r\nto 0·89. By a reduction of temperature, it concretes owing to the\r\nseparation of light, brilliant, platy crystals of a stearoptene, the\r\nproportion of which differs with the country in which the roses have\r\nbeen grown, the state of the weather during which the flowers were\r\ngathered, and other circumstances less well ascertained. The oil\r\nproduced in the Balkans solidifies, according to Baur, at from 11\r\nto 16° C. In some experiments made by one of us[1025] in 1859, the\r\n_fusing_ point of true Turkish attar was found to vary from 16 to 18°;\r\nthat of a sample from India was 20° C.; of oil distilled in the south\r\nof France, 21 to 23°, of an oil produced in Paris, 29°; of oil obtained\r\nin distilling roses for rose water in London, 30 to 32° C.\r\n\r\n[1020] _Pharm.

The oil\r\nfrom English roses which we examined exhibited no rotation.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Rose oil is a mixture of a liquid constituent\r\ncontaining oxygen, to which it owes its perfume, and the solid\r\nhydrocarbon or stearoptene already mentioned, which is entirely\r\ndestitute of odour. The proportion which these bodies bear to each\r\nother is extremely variable. From the Turkish oil, it may be obtained\r\nto the extent of 18 per cent., and from French and English to 35, 42,\r\n60 or even 68 per cent.\r\n\r\nThough the stearoptene can be entirely freed from the oxygenated\r\noil, no method is known for the complete isolation of the latter. As\r\nobtained by Gladstone[1026], it had a sp. gr. of 0·881 and a boiling\r\npoint of 216° C.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the stearoptene of rose oil, the analyses of Théodore de\r\nSaussure (1820) and Blanchet (1833) long since showed its composition\r\nto accord with the formula CₙH₂ₙ. The experiments of one of us[1027]\r\nconfirm this striking fact, which assigns to the stearoptene in\r\nquestion a very exceptional place among the hydrocarbons of volatile\r\noils, all of which are less rich in hydrogen.\r\n\r\nRose stearoptene separates when attar of roses is mixed with alcohol.\r\nWe have isolated it also from oil obtained from Mitcham roses, by\r\ndiluting the oil with a little chloroform and precipitating with\r\nglacial acetic acid or spirit of wine, the process being several times\r\nrepeated. The stearoptene was lastly maintained for some days at\r\n100° C.; thus obtained, it is inodorous, but when heated evolves an\r\noffensive smell like that of heated wax or fat. At 32·5° it melts; at\r\n150° vapour is evolved; at 272° C. it begins to boil, soon after which\r\nit turns brown and then blackish. Stains of the stearoptene on paper\r\ndo not disappear by the heat of the water-bath and the relapse of some\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nIf cautiously melted by the warmth of the sun, the stearoptene forms\r\non cooling microscopic crystals of very peculiar shape. Most of them\r\nhave the form of truncated hexahedral pyramids, not however belonging\r\nto the rhombohedric system, as the angles are evidently not equal;\r\nmany of them are oddly curved, thus §. Examined under the polarizing\r\nmicroscope, these crystals from their refractive power make a brilliant\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nRose stearoptene is a very stable body, yet by boiling it for some days\r\nwith fuming nitric acid, it is slowly dissolved, and converted into\r\nvarious acids of the homologous series of fatty acids, and into oxalic\r\nacid. Among the former, we detected butyric and valerianic. The chief\r\nproduct is however succinic acid, which we obtained in pure crystals,\r\nshowing all the well-known reactions.\r\n\r\n[1026] _Journ. of Chem. Soc._ x. (1872) 12.\r\n\r\n[1027] Flückiger, _Pharm. Journ._ x. (1869) 147.\r\n\r\nThe same products are obtained even much easier by treating paraffin\r\nwith nitric acid; it yields however less of succinic acid. The general\r\nbehaviour and appearance of paraffin is in fact nearly the same as\r\nthat of rose stearoptene. But what is called _paraffin_, is a series\r\nof extremely similar hydrocarbons, answering to the general formula\r\nCₙH₍₂ₙ₊₂₎ (_n_ being equal to more than 16), the separation of which\r\nhas not yet been thoroughly effected. The fusion point of the different\r\nkinds of paraffin generally ranges from 42 to 60° C., yet one sort from\r\nthe bituminous shale of Autun, prepared and examined by Laurent,[1028]\r\nmelts at 33° C., and in this respect agrees with our stearoptene. It\r\nis therefore possible that the latter actually belongs to the paraffin\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nWe have not ascertained the correctness of Baur’s strange experiments\r\n(1872, _Jahresbericht der Pharm._ p. 460), by which he believes to have\r\nconverted the liquid part of rose oil into the stearoptene by means of\r\na current of hydrogen.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Formerly attar of rose came into commerce by way of\r\nAustria; it is now shipped from Constantinople. From the interior,\r\nit is transported in flattened round tin bottles called _kunkumas_,\r\nholding from 1 to 10 lb., which are sewed up in white woollen cloth.\r\nThese sometimes reach this country, but more commonly the attar is\r\ntransferred at Constantinople to small white glass bottles, ornamented\r\nwith gilding, imported from Germany.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Attar of rose is of no medicinal importance, but serves\r\noccasionally as a scent for ointments. Rose water is sometimes made\r\nwith it, but is not so good as that distilled from the flowers. Attar\r\nis much used in perfumery, but still more in the scenting of snuff.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—No drug is more subject than attar of rose to\r\nadulteration, which is principally effected by the addition of the\r\nvolatile oil of an Indian grass, _Andropogon Schœnanthus_ L. This\r\noil, which is called in Turkish _Idris yàghi_, and also _Entershah_,\r\nand is more or less known to Europeans as _Geranium Oil_, is imported\r\ninto Turkey for this express purpose, and even submitted to a sort\r\nof purification before being used.[1029] It was formerly added to\r\nthe attar only in Constantinople, but now the mixing takes place\r\nat the seat of the manufacture. It is said that in many places the\r\nroses are absolutely sprinkled with it before being placed in the\r\nstill. As grass oil does not solidify by cold, its admixture with\r\nrose oil renders the latter less disposed to crystallize. Hence\r\narises a preference among the dealers in Turkey for attar of the\r\nmountain districts, which, having a good proportion of stearoptene,\r\nwill bear the larger dilution with grass oil without its tendency to\r\ncrystallize becoming suspiciously small. Thus, in the circular of a\r\ncommercial house in Constantinople, dated from Kizanlik, occur the\r\nphrases—“_Extra strong oil_,”—“_Good strong congealing oil_,”—“_Strong\r\ngood freezing oil_;”—while the 3rd quality of attar is spoken of as\r\na “_not congealing oil_.” The same circular states the belief of the\r\nwriters, that in the season in which they wrote, “_not a single metical\r\nof unadulterated oil_” would be sent away.\r\n\r\nThe chief criteria, according to Baur, for the purity of rose oil\r\nare:—1. _Temperature at which crystallization takes place_: a good\r\noil should congeal well in five minutes at a temperature of 12·5° C.\r\n2. _Manner of crystallizing._—The crystals should be light, feathery,\r\nshining plates, filling the whole liquid. Spermaceti, which has been\r\nsometimes used to replace the stearoptene, is liable to settle down in\r\na _solid cake_, and is easily recognizable. Furthermore, it melts at\r\n50° C. and so do most varieties of paraffin. The microscopic crystals\r\nof the latter are somewhat similar to those of rose stearoptene, yet\r\nthey may be distinguished by an attentive comparative examination.\r\n\r\n[1028] _Ann. de Chim. et de Phys._ liv.

Galen[1031] mentions them as gathered by country people\r\nin his day, as they still are in Europe. Gerarde in the 16th century\r\nremarks that the fruit when ripe—“maketh most pleasant meats and\r\nbanqueting dishes, as tarts and such like.“ Though the pulp of hips\r\npreserved with sugar which is here alluded to, is no longer brought to\r\ntable, at least in this country,[1032] it retains a place in pharmacy\r\nas a useful ingredient of pill-masses and electuaries.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit of a rose consists of the bottle-shaped calyx,\r\nbecome dilated and succulent by growth, and sometimes crowned with 5\r\nleafy segments, enclosing numerous dry carpels or achenes, containing\r\neach one exalbuminous seed. The fruit of _R. canina_ called a _hip_, is\r\novoid, about ¾ of an inch long, with a smooth, red, shining surface. It\r\nis of a dense, fleshy texture, becoming on maturity, especially after\r\nfrost, soft and pulpy, the pulp within the shining skin being of an\r\norange colour, and of an agreeable sweetish subacid taste. The large\r\ninterior cavity contains numerous hard achenes, which, as well as the\r\nwalls of the former, are covered with strong short hairs.\r\n\r\nFor medicinal use, the only part required is the soft orange pulp,\r\nwhich is separated by rubbing it through a hair sieve.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The epidermis of the fruit is made up of\r\ntabular cells containing red granules, which are much more abundant\r\nin the pulp. The latter, as usual in many ripe fruits, consists of\r\nisolated cells no longer forming a coherent tissue. Besides these\r\ncells, there occur small fibro-vascular bundles. Some of the cells\r\nenclose tufted crystals of oxalate of calcium; most of them however\r\nare loaded with red granules, either globular or somewhat elongated.\r\nThey assume a bluish hue on addition of perchloride of iron, and are\r\nturned blackish by iodine. The later colouration reminds one of that\r\nassumed by starch granules under similar circumstances; yet on addition\r\nof a very dilute solution of iodine, the granules always exhibit a\r\n_blackish_, not a blue tint, so that they are not to be considered\r\nas starch granules. The hairs of the pulp are formed of a single,\r\nthick-walled cell, straight or sometimes a little crooked.\r\n\r\n[1030] Baker, _Journ. of Linn. Soc._ Bot. xi.

In the Amur country a\r\nmuch larger and better fruit is afforded by _R. acicularis_ Lindl. and\r\n_R. cinnamomea_ L.—Maximowicz, _Primitiæ Floræ Amurensis_, 1859. 100.\r\n453.\r\n\r\n[1032] In Switzerland and Alsace a very agreeable _confiture_ of hips\r\nis still in use.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The pulp examined by Biltz (1824) was found to\r\nafford nearly 3 per cent. of citric acid, 7·7 of malic acid, besides\r\ncitrates, malates and mineral salts, 25 per cent. of gum, and 30 of\r\nuncrystallizable sugar.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Hips are employed solely on account of their pulp, which mixed\r\nwith twice its weight of sugar, constitutes the _Confectio Rosæ caninæ_\r\nof pharmacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEN CYDONIÆ.\r\n\r\n_Quince Seeds_, _Quince Pips_; F. _Semences ou Pepins de Coings_; G.\r\n_Quittensamen_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Pirus Cydonia_ L. (_Cydonia vulgaris_ Pers.), the\r\nquince tree, is supposed to be a true native of Western Asia, from\r\nthe Caucasian provinces of Russia to the Hindu Kush range in Northern\r\nIndia. But it is now apparently wild also in many of the countries\r\nwhich surround the Mediterranean basin.\r\n\r\nIn a cultivated state, it flourishes throughout temperate Europe,\r\nbut is far more productive in southern than in northern regions.\r\nQuinces ripen in the south of England, but not in Scotland, nor in St.\r\nPetersburg, or in Christiana.\r\n\r\n=History=—The quince was held in high esteem by the ancients, who\r\nconsidered it an emblem of happiness and fertility; and, as such, it\r\nwas dedicated to Venus, whose temples it was used to decorate. Some\r\nantiquarians maintain that quinces were the _Golden Apples_ of the\r\nHesperides. The name Cydonia alludes to the town of Kydon, now Canea,\r\nin Creta; in the Talmud quinces are called Cretan apples.\r\n\r\nPorcius Cato in his graphic description of the management of a Roman\r\nfarmhouse, alludes to the storing of quinces both cultivated and wild;\r\nand there is much other evidence to prove that from an early period the\r\nquince was abundantly grown throughout Italy. Charlemagne, A.D. 812,\r\nenjoined its cultivation in central Europe.[1033] At what period it\r\nwas introduced into Britain is not evident, but we have observed that\r\n_Baked Quinces_ are mentioned among the viands served at the famous\r\ninstallation feast of Nevill, archbishop of York in 1466.[1034]\r\n\r\nThe use of mucilage of quince seeds has come to us through the\r\nArabians; it is still met with in Turkestan.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The quince is a handsome fruit of a golden yellow, in\r\nshape and size resembling a pear. It has a very agreeable and powerful\r\nsmell, but an austere, astringent taste, so that it is not eatable in\r\nthe raw state. In structure, it differs from an apple or a pear in\r\nhaving many seeds in each cell, instead of only two.\r\n\r\n[1033] Pertz, _Monumenta Germaniæ historica_, Legum, i. (1835) 187.\r\n\r\n[1034] Leland, _De rebus Britannicis Collectanea_, vi. (1774) 5.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is, like an apple, 5-celled, with each cell containing a\r\ndouble row of closely-packed seeds, 8 to 14 in number, cohering by a\r\nsoft mucilaginous membrane with which each is surrounded. By drying,\r\nthey become hard, but remain agglutinated as in the cell. The seeds\r\nhave an ovoid or obconic form, rather flattened and 3-sided by mutual\r\npressure. From the hilum at the lower pointed end, the raphe passes as\r\na straight ridge to the opposite extremity, which is slightly beaked\r\nand marked with a scar indicating the chalaza. The edge opposite\r\nthe raphe is more or less arched according to the position of the\r\nindividual seed in the cell. The testa encloses two thick, veined\r\ncotyledons, having a straight radicle directed towards the hilum.\r\n\r\nQuince seeds have a mahogany-brown colour, and when unbroken a simply\r\nmucilaginous taste. But the kernels have the odour and taste of bitter\r\nalmonds, and evolve hydrocyanic acid when comminuted and mixed with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The epidermis of the seed consists of one row\r\nof cylindrical cells, the walls of which swell up in the presence of\r\nwater and are dissolved, so as to yield an abundance of mucilage.\r\nThis process can easily be observed, if thin sections of the seed are\r\nexamined under glycerine, which acts on them but slowly.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The mucilage of the epidermis is present in such\r\nquantity, that the seed easily coagulates forty times its weight of\r\nwater. By complete exhaustion, the seeds afford about 20 per cent. of\r\ndry mucilage, containing considerable quantities of calcium salts and\r\nalbuminous matter, of which it is not easily deprived. When treated\r\nwith nitric acid, it yields oxalic acid. After a short treatment with\r\nstrong sulphuric acid it is coloured blue by iodine. Tollens and\r\nKirchner (1874) assign to it the formula C₁₈H₂₈O₁₄, regarding it as a\r\ncompound of gum, C₁₂H₂₀O₁₀, and cellulose, C₆H₁₀O₅, less one molecule\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nQuince mucilage has but little adhesive power, and is not thickened by\r\nborax. That portion of it which is really in a state of solution and\r\nwhich may be separated by filtration, is precipitable by metallic salts\r\nor by alcohol. The latter precipitate after it has been dried is no\r\nlonger dissolved by water either cold or warm. Quince mucilage is, on\r\nthe whole, to be regarded as a soluble modification of cellulose.\r\n\r\nThe seeds on distillation with water afford a little hydrocyanic acid,\r\nand, probably, bitter almond oil.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Quince seeds reach England from Hamburg; and are frequently\r\nquoted in Hamburg price-currents as _Russian_; they are also brought\r\nfrom the south of France and from the Cape of Good Hope. They are\r\nlargely imported into India from the Persian Gulf, and by land from\r\nAfghanistan.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—A decoction of quince seeds is occasionally used as a demulcent\r\nexternal application in skin complaints. It is also sometimes added to\r\neye-lotions. Quince seeds are in general use among the natives of India\r\nas a demulcent tonic and restorative. They have been found useful by\r\nEuropeans in dysentery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMAMELIDEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTYRAX LIQUIDUS.[1035]\r\n\r\n_Balsamum Styracis_; _Liquid Storax_; F. _Styrax liquide_; G.\r\n_Flüssiger Storax_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Liquidambar orientalis_ Miller (_L. imberbe\r\nAiton_), a handsome, umbrageous tree resembling a plane, growing to\r\nthe height of 30 to 40 feet or more,[1036] and forming forests in the\r\nextreme south-western part of Asia Minor. In this region the tree\r\noccurs in the district of Sighala near Melasso, about Budrum (the\r\nancient Halicarnassus) and Moughla, also near Giova and Ullà in the\r\nGulf of Giova, and lastly near Marmorizza and Isgengak opposite Rhodes.\r\nIt also grows in the valley of the El-Asi (the ancient Orontes), as\r\nproved by a specimen in the Vienna herbarium, collected by Gödel,\r\nAustrian Consul at Alexandretta. In this locality it was seen by\r\nKotschy in 1835, but mistaken for a plane. The same traveller informed\r\none of us that he believed it to occur at Narkislik, a village near\r\nAlexandretta.\r\n\r\nThe tree is not known to grow in Cyprus, Candia, Rhodes, Kos, or indeed\r\nin any of the islands of the Mediterranean.[1037]\r\n\r\n=History=—Two substances of different origin have been known from a\r\nremote period under the name of _Styrax_ or _Storax_, namely the resin\r\nof _Styrax officinalis_ L. (see further on), and that of _Liquidambar\r\norientalis_ Miller, the latter commonly distinguished as _Liquid\r\nStorax_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Krinos of Athens, who has carefully investigated the\r\nhistory of the drug,[1038] the earliest allusions to Liquid Storax\r\noccur in the writings of Aëtius and of Paulus Ægineta,[1039] who\r\nname both _Storax_ and _Liquid Storax_ (πύρα ζυγρὸς). Of these Greek\r\nphysicians, who lived respectively in the 6th and 7th centuries, the\r\nsecond also mentions the resin of Ζυγία, which is regarded by Krinos as\r\nsynonymous with the latter substance.[1040]\r\n\r\n[1035] The feminine gender of Styrax has been in use for a long time.\r\nIn Greek it denotes the tree, as also does sometimes the masculine\r\ngender, the _neutral_ being reserved to the resin. In Latin the resin\r\nis masculini generis (Dr. Rice).\r\n\r\n[1036] For a good figure of _L. orientalis_, see Hooker’s _Icones\r\nPlantarum_ (3rd series, 1867) pl. 1019, or Hanbury, _Science Papers_,\r\n1876. 140; also Bentley and Trimen, _Medicinal Plants_, part 27 (1877).\r\n\r\n[1037] The fine old trees existing at the convent of Antiphoniti on the\r\nnorth coast of Cyprus, and at that of Neophiti near Papho, specimens\r\nof which were distributed by Kotschy as _Liquidambar imberbis_ Ait.,\r\nagree in all points with the American _L. stryaciflua_ L., and not with\r\nthe Asiatic plant. Kotschy has told me that they have _certainly been\r\nplanted_, and that no other examples exist in the island.—D. H. The\r\nsame opinion is adopted by Boissier, _Flora Orientalis_, ii. (1872)\r\n8319.\r\n\r\n[1038] Περί Στύακοτ δίατριβὴ ϕαρμακογραϕικὴ ἐν Ἀθῆναιπ, 1862.—This\r\npamphlet is also the subject of a paper of Prof. Planchon, _Journ. de\r\nPharm._ 24 (1876) 172. 243.\r\n\r\n[1039] _Medicæ Artis Principes post Hippocratem et Galenum_, Par.\r\n1567.—Aëtii tetr. 4. serm. 4. c. 122; P. Ægineta, _De re med._ vii. 20.\r\n\r\n[1040] The foliage of the Liquidambar much resembles that of the common\r\nmaple (_Acer campestre_ L.); hence the two trees as well as the plane\r\n(_Platanus orientalis_ L.) are confounded under one name,—Ζυγὸς or\r\nΖυγίᾳ. So _Styrax officinalis_ L., from the resemblance of its leaves\r\nto those of _Pirus Cydonia_ L., is known in Greece as Ζυγὸς κυδωνήα\r\nkydônêa, i.e. _wild quince_.\r\n\r\nWe find in fact the term _Sigia_ frequently mentioned by Rhazes (10th\r\ncentury) as signifying Liquid Storax. This and other Arabian physicians\r\nwere also familiar with the same substance under the name of _Miha_\r\n(_may’a_), and also knew how and whence it was obtained.[1041]\r\n\r\nA curious account of the collecting of Liquid Storax from the tree\r\n_Zygia_, and from another tree called _Stourika_, is given in the\r\ntravels through Asia Minor to Palestine of the Russian abbot of Tver in\r\nA.D. 1113-1115.[1042]\r\n\r\nThe wide exportation and ancient use of Liquid Storax are very\r\nremarkable: even in the first century, as appears by the author of the\r\nPeriplus of the Erythrean Sea, Storax, by which term there can be but\r\nlittle doubt _Liquid Storax_ was intended, was exported by the Red\r\nSea to India. Whether the _Storax_ and _Storax Isaurica_ offered to\r\nthe Church of Rome under St. Silvester, A.D. 314-335, by the emperor\r\nConstantine,[1043] was Liquid Storax or the more precious resin of\r\n_Styrax officinalis_ L., is a point we cannot determine. That the\r\nChinese used the drug was a fact known to Garcia de Orta (1535-63):\r\nBretschneider[1044] has shown from Chinese sources that, together with\r\nolibanum and myrrh, it was imported by the Arabs into China during\r\nthe Ming dynasty, A.D. 1368-1628. This trade is still carried on: the\r\ndrug is conveyed by way of the Red Sea to Bombay, and thence shipped\r\nto China. Official returns show that the quantity thus exported from\r\nBombay in the year 1856-57 was 13,328 lb. In the time of Kämpfer\r\n(1690-92), Liquid Storax was one of the most profitable articles of\r\nshipment to Japan.[1045]\r\n\r\nLiquid Storax is known in the East, at least in the price-currents and\r\ntrade statistics of Europeans, by the strange-sounding name of _Rose\r\nMalloes_ (_Rosa Mallas_, _Rosum Alloes_, _Rosmal_), a designation for\r\nit in use in the time of Garcia de Orta. Clusius[1046] considered it to\r\nbe Arabic, which, however, the scholars whom we have consulted do not\r\nallow. Others identify it with _Rasamala_, the Malay name for _Altingia\r\nexcelsa_. (See further on.)\r\n\r\nThe botanical origin of Liquid Storax was long a perplexing question\r\nto pharmacologists. It was correctly determined by Krinos, but his\r\ninformation on the subject published in a Greek newspaper in 1841, and\r\nrepeated by Kosté in 1855,[1047] attracted no attention in Western\r\nEurope. The question was also investigated by one of the authors\r\nof the present work, whose observations, together with a figure of\r\n_Liquidambar orientalis_ Miller, were published in 1857.[1048]\r\n\r\n[1041] _Ibn Baytar_, Sontheimer’s transl. ii. 539.\r\n\r\n[1042] Noroff, _Pèlerinage en Terre Sainte de l’Igoumène russe Daniel_,\r\nSt. Pétersb. 164.4°.—The passage has been kindly abstracted for us by\r\nProf. Heyd of Stuttgart.\r\n\r\n[1043] Vignolius, _Liber Pontificalis_, Romæ, i.

(1863)\r\n436; _Science Papers_, 127-150.\r\n\r\n=Method of Extraction=—The extraction of Liquid Storax is carried on\r\nin the forests of the south-west of Asia Minor, chiefly by a tribe of\r\nwandering Turcomans called _Yuruks_. The process has been described\r\non the authority of Maltass and McCraith of Smyrna, and of Campbell,\r\nBritish Consul at Rhodes.[1049] The outer bark is said to be first\r\nremoved from the trunk of the tree and rejected; the inner is then\r\nscraped off with a peculiar iron knife or scraper, and thrown into pits\r\nuntil a sufficient quantity has been collected. It is then boiled with\r\nwater in a large copper, by which process the resin is separated, so\r\nthat it can be skimmed off. This seems to be performed with sea water;\r\nsome chloride of sodium can therefore be extracted from the drug. The\r\nboiled bark is put into hair bags and squeezed under a rude lever, hot\r\nwater being added to assist in the separation of the resin, or as it\r\nis termed _yagh_, i.e. _oil_. Maltass states that the bark is pressed\r\nin the first instance _per se_, and afterwards treated with hot water.\r\nIn either case the products obtained are the opaque, grey, semi-fluid\r\nresin known as _Liquid Storax_, and the fragrant cakes of foliaceous,\r\nbrown bark, once common[1050] but now rare in European pharmacy, called\r\n_Cortex Thymiamatis_.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to M. Felix Sahut of Montpellier for a specimen of\r\nthe bark of _Liquidambar orientalis_, cut from the trunk of a fine\r\ntree on his property at the neighbouring village of Lattes. The bark\r\nwhich is covered with a very thick corky layer and soaked in its own\r\nfragrant resin, shows no tendency to exfoliate. The investigations\r\nof Unger[1051] in Cyprus are consequently to us inexplicable; he\r\nasserts that the bark scales off, like that of the plane, by continued\r\nexfoliation, which is not the case with that of M. Sahut’s tree.\r\n\r\n[1049] Hanbury, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[1050] It is no doubt the “_Cortex Olibani_” met with in the tariff of\r\n1571, in Flückiger, _Documente zur Geschichte der Pharmacie_, 26.\r\n\r\n[1051] Unger u. Kotschy, _Die Insel Cypern_. Wien, 1865. 410.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Liquid Storax is a soft viscid resin, usually of the\r\nconsistence of honey, heavier than water, opaque and greyish brown. It\r\nalways contains water, which by long standing rises to the surface.\r\nIn one sample that had been kept more than 20 years, the resin at the\r\nbottom of the bottle formed a transparent layer of a pale golden brown.\r\nWhen liquid storax is heated, it becomes by the loss of water dark\r\nbrown and transparent, the solid impurities settling to the bottom.\r\nSpread out in a very thin layer, it partially dries, but does not\r\nwholly lose its stickiness. When free from water (which reddens litmus)\r\nit dissolves in alcohol, spirit of wine, chloroform, ether, glacial\r\nacetic acid, bisulphide of carbon, and most of the essential oils, but\r\nnot in the most volatile part of petroleum (“petroleum ether”). It has\r\na pleasant balsamic smell, especially after it has been long kept; when\r\nrecent, it is contaminated with an odour of bitumen or naphthalene\r\nthat is far from agreeable. Its taste is sharply pungent, burning and\r\naromatic.\r\n\r\nWhen the opaque resin is subjected to microscopic examination, small\r\nbrownish granules are observed in a viscid, colourless, transparent\r\nliquid, besides which large drops of a mobile watery liquid may\r\nbe distinguished. In polarized light, numerous minute crystalline\r\nfragments with a few larger tabular crystals are obvious. But when\r\nthin layers of the resin are left on the object glass in a warm\r\nplace, feathery or spicular crystals (styracin) shoot out on the\r\nedge of the clear liquid, while in the large, sharply-defined drops\r\nabove mentioned, rectangular tables and short prisms (cinnamic acid)\r\nmake their appearance. On applying more warmth after the water is\r\nevaporated, all the substances unite into a transparent, dark brown,\r\nthick liquid, which exhibits no crystalline structure on cooling, or\r\nonly after a very long time. Among the fragments of the bark occurring\r\nin the crude resin, liber-fibres are frequently observable.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most abundant constituent of Styrax is\r\nprobably the _Storesin_, C₃₆H₅₅(OH)₃, discovered in 1877 by W. von\r\nMiller, or rather cinnamic ethers of it and of an isomeric substance.\r\nStoresin is an amorphous substance melting at 168° C., readily soluble\r\nin petroleum ether. Several other compound ethers have also been\r\nobserved in the drug, as for instance _cinnamic ether of phenylpropyl_,\r\n_cinnamic ether of ethyl_, cinnamic ether of benzyl, and especially\r\ncinnamate of cinnamyl, C₉H₇O₂·C₉H₉, the so-called _Styracin_. This\r\nsubstance, discovered by Bonastre in 1827, can be removed by ether,\r\nbenzol or alcohol, after the separation from the resin of the cinnamic\r\nacid; it is insoluble in water, and volatile only in super-heated\r\nsteam. It crystallizes in tufts of long rectangular prisms, which\r\nmelt at 38° C., but it frequently does not solidify in a crystalline\r\nform, or only after a long time, or remains as an oily liquid. In its\r\npure state it is inodorous and tasteless. By concentrated solution\r\nof potash, it is resolved into a cinnamate, and cinnamic alcohol\r\n(_Styrone_) C₉H₁₀O, which latter is not present in Liquid Storax. The\r\n_cinnamic acid_ may be extracted to a small extent by boiling water,\r\nmore completely by means of a boiling solution of carbonate of sodium,\r\nas it is present in the drug partly in the free state. Its compound\r\nethers may be decomposed by caustic lye. The yield of cinnamic acid\r\naccordingly varies from 6 to 12 per cent.—or even, according to Löwe,\r\nas much as 23 per cent. of crystallized cinnamic acid can be obtained.\r\nThe acid dissolves abundantly in ether, alcohol, or hot water, slightly\r\nin cold water; it is inodorous, but has an acrid taste. It fuses at\r\n133° C., and boils at 290° C.; at a dull red heat it is resolved into\r\ncarbonic acid and styrol, which latter is therefore related to it in\r\nthe same manner as benzol (benzene) to benzoic acid. Liquid styrax is\r\nin fact the best source of cinnamic acid.\r\n\r\nAnother constituent of styrax is a fragrant substance, perhaps\r\n_ethylvanillin_, occurring in but small quantity.\r\n\r\nLaubenheimer (1872) has shown that probably _Benzylic Alcohol_, C₇H₈O,\r\nboiling at 206° C., likewise occurs in Liquid Storax; it has not been\r\nfound by Miller. The latter chemist also showed that water removes from\r\nthe drug a little _benzoïc acid_; he observed moreover a substance\r\nsimilar to _caoutchouc_ among the constituents of liquid styrax.\r\n\r\nThere is further to be mentioned as having been met with in Liquid\r\nStorax a hydrocarbon, C₈H₈, first prepared by Simon in 1839, which\r\nexists in the resin as a liquid, and also in a polymeric form as a\r\nsolid. The former called _Styrol_, _Cinnamene_, or _Cinnamol_, has a\r\nsp. gr. of 0·924, and a boiling point of 146° C. It is a colourless,\r\nmobile liquid which may be obtained by distilling with water liquid\r\nstorax, the odour and burning taste of which it possesses. When heated\r\nfor a considerable time to 100°, or for a shorter period to 200° C.,\r\nit is converted without change of composition into the colourless,\r\ntransparent solid _Metastyrol_, which, unlike styrol, is not soluble\r\nin alcohol or ether. It has a sp. gr. of 1·054, and may be cut with\r\na knife. By prolonged heating, it can be converted into its original\r\nliquid form.\r\n\r\nStyrol is to be regarded as phenylated ethylene; it can be\r\nartificially obtained by shaking powdered cinnamic acid with saturated\r\nhydrobromic acid, when crystalline hydrobromated cinnamic acid,\r\nC₆H₅·CH₂·CHBr·COOH, is formed. One part of the latter, 10 parts of\r\nwater, and a little more carbonate of sodium than the quantity required\r\nfor saturation are mixed. The bromhydrocinnamate of sodium partly\r\nsplits up immediately, even at 0°, according to the following equation\r\n\r\n    C₆H₅·CH₂·CHBr·COONa = CO₂ + NaBr + C₆H₅·CH·CH₂.\r\n    Bromhydrocinnamate                 Styrol.\r\n       of sodium.\r\n\r\n24 parts of bromhydrocinnamic acid, recrystallized from boiling\r\nbisulphide of carbon, yield about 7 parts of styrol; no other method\r\naffords as much as this.\r\n\r\nStyrol has been discovered in Styrax, but is not regularly, and at all\r\nevents to a minute amount only, found in the drug of the present day.\r\nWe have no explanation for the strange fact that it was apparently more\r\nabundantly met with in former times.\r\n\r\nLastly there has been found in Liquid Storax, by J. H. van t’Hoff\r\n(1876), about 0·4 per cent. of an _essential oil_, probably C₁₀H₁₆O;\r\nMiller also pointed out a compound ether of probably the same\r\n(alcoholic) substance as occurring in styrax.\r\n\r\nBy the action of oxidizing agents, as nitric or chromic acids, or\r\nperoxide of lead, the cinnamyl compounds are easily reduced, carbonic\r\nacid and water being evolved; and at the same time benzoic acid, bitter\r\nalmond oil, and hydrocyanic acid are produced. These compounds are in\r\nfact abundantly evolved when 6 parts of Liquid Storax are gently warmed\r\nwith 1 p. of caustic soda, and then mixed with 3 p. of permanganate of\r\npotassium dissolved in 20 p. of water.\r\n\r\nWe have examined several samples of Liquid Storax of average quality,\r\nand found by exposure of small quantities to the heat of the steam\r\nbath, that it lost from 10 to 20 per cent. of water. The remainder\r\ntreated with alcohol yielded a residue amounting to 13 to 18 per cent.,\r\nconsisting chiefly of fragments of bark and inorganic impurities.\r\nThe percentage of the drug soluble in alcohol, to which is due its\r\ntherapeutic value, thus amounts to 56 to 72. This part, as may be\r\ninferred from the foregoing statements, consists chiefly of storesin,\r\nthe various compound ethers above mentioned, of cinnamic acid and of\r\nstyracin, no doubt in greatly varying proportions.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The annual production of Liquid Storax was estimated by\r\nCampbell in 1855 as about 490 cwt. for the districts of Giova and Ullá,\r\nand 300 cwt. for those of Marmorizza and Isgengak. The drug is exported\r\nin barrels to Constantinople, Smyrna, Syra and Alexandria. Some is also\r\npacked with a certain proportion of water in goatskins, and sent either\r\nby boats or overland to Smyrna, where it is transferred to barrels and\r\nshipped mostly to Trieste.\r\n\r\nThe chief consumption of Liquid Storax would appear to be in India and\r\nChina. In the fiscal year 1866-67, Bombay imported 319 cwt. from the\r\nRed Sea. Liquid Storax is seldom seen in the London drug-sales.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Liquid Storax, which the _British Pharmacopœia_ directs to be\r\npurified by solution in spirit of wine, is an ingredient in a few\r\nold-fashioned preparations but is hardly ever prescribed on its own\r\naccount. It is stated to be expectorant and stimulant, and useful in\r\nchronic bronchial affections. It has been recommended by Pastau, Berlin\r\n(1865), as an external application for the cure of scabies, for which\r\npurpose it is mixed with linseed oil and now largely used.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The drug is occasionally mixed with sand, ashes, and\r\nother substances; these would be detected by solution in spirit of\r\nwine, as well as by the microscope.\r\n\r\nAllied Substances.\r\n\r\n_Styrax Calamita_ (_Storax en pain_ Guibourt)—The substance that now\r\nbears this name is by no means the _Styrax Calamita_ of ancient times,\r\nbut is an artificial compound made by mixing the residual Liquidambar\r\nbark called _Cortex Thymiamatis_ (p. 273), coarsely powdered, with\r\nLiquid Storax in the proportions of 3 to 2. It is at first a clammy\r\nmass, acquiring after a few weeks an appearance of mouldiness, due to\r\nminute silky crystals of styracin. It is usually imported in wooden\r\ndrums, and has a very sweet smell. When the bark is scarce, common\r\nsawdust is substituted for it, while qualities still inferior are made\r\nup with the help of olibanum, honey, and earthy substances. This drug\r\nis manufactured at Trieste, Venice and Marseilles.\r\n\r\nSeveral other odoriferous compounds, of which Liquid Storax appears to\r\nbe the chief ingredient, are made in the East and may still be found in\r\nold drug warehouses.[1052]\r\n\r\n_Resin of Styrax officinalis_ L.; =_True Storax_=—This was a solid\r\nresin somewhat resembling benzoin, of fragrant, balsamic odour,\r\nheld in great estimation from the time of Dioscorides and Pliny\r\ndown to the close of the last century. It was perhaps the “storace\r\nodorifero” exported in the 12th century from Pantellaria[1053] and\r\nSicily. The drug was obtained from the stem of _Styrax officinalis_ L.\r\n(_Styraceæ_), a native of Greece, Asia Minor and Syria, now found also\r\nin Italy and Southern France. This plant when permitted to grow freely\r\nfor several years, forms a small tree, in which state alone it appears\r\nto be capable of affording a fragrant resin. But in most localities it\r\nhas been reduced by ruthless lopping to a mere bush, the young stems\r\nof which yield not a trace of exudation. True storax has thus utterly\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nProfessor Krinos of Athens has informed us (1871) that about Adalia\r\non the southern coast of Asia Minor, a sort of solid storax obtained\r\nfrom _S. officinalis_ is still used as incense in the churches and\r\nmosques. The specimen of it which he has been good enough to send us,\r\nis not however resin, but _sawdust_; it is of a pale cinnamon-brown,\r\nand pleasant balsamic odour. By keeping, it emits an abundance of\r\nminute acicular crystals (styracin?). The substance is interesting\r\nin connection with the statement of Dioscorides, that the resin of\r\n_Styrax_ is adulterated with the _sawdust of the tree itself_, and the\r\nfact that the region where this sawdust is still in use is one of the\r\nlocalities for the drug (Pisidia) which he mentions.\r\n\r\n[1052] The _Storax noir_ of Guibourt is one of these.\r\n\r\n[1053] Quoted before, p. 163, note 3; in the same book “_cotone storace\r\ne corallo_“ occur as articles of export from Sicily.\r\n\r\n_Resin of Liquidambar styraciflua_ L.—a large and beautiful tree,\r\nnative of North America from Connecticut and Illinois southward to\r\nMexico and Guatemala. In the United States, where it is called _Sweet\r\nGum_, the tree yields from natural fissures or by incision, small\r\nquantities of a balsamic resin, which is occasionally used for chewing.\r\nWe have before us an excellent sample of it collected for Messrs.\r\nWallace Brothers of Statesville, N. Carolina.[1054]\r\n\r\nIn Central America this exudation is far more freely produced;\r\nan authentic specimen from Guatemala in our possession is a pale\r\nyellow, opaque resin of honey-like consistence, becoming transparent,\r\namber-coloured and brittle by exposure to the air. It has a rather\r\nterebinthinous, balsamic odour. In the mouth it softens like benzoin\r\nor mastich, and has but little taste. Another specimen also from\r\nGuatemala, a thick, fluid oleo-resin, of a golden brown hue, was\r\ncontributed to the Paris Exhibition in 1878.\r\n\r\nThe resin of _L. styraciflua_ L. has been ascertained by Procter[1055]\r\nto contain cinnamic, but not benzoic acid. Harrison[1056] found it to\r\ncontain styracin and essential oil (styrol?).\r\n\r\n_Resin of Liquidambar formosana_ Hance—This tree, which we suppose\r\nmay be the _Styrax liquida folio minore_, which Ray names[1057] as\r\noccurring in a collection of plants from Amoy, is a native of Formosa\r\nand Southern China, where it affords a dry terebinthinous resin,\r\nof agreeable fragrance when heated. Of this resin, which is used\r\nby the Chinese, a specimen collected in Formosa by Mr. Swinhoe has\r\nbeen presented to us by Dr. Hooker. A tree figured under the name of\r\n_Fung-heang_ in the _Pun-tsao_[1058] is, we presume, this species.\r\n\r\n_Resin of Altingia excelsa_ Noronha (_Liquidambar Altingiana_ Bl.)\r\n=_Rasamala_= of the Javanese and Malays—The _Rasamala_ is a magnificent\r\ntree of the Indian Archipelago, Burma and Assam. In Java it yields by\r\nincisions in the trunk an odorous resin, yet only very slowly and in\r\nvery small quantity; this resin is not, or at least not regularly,\r\ncollected. In Burma, on the other hand, the tree affords a fragrant\r\nbalsam, of which according to Waring[1059] there are two varieties,\r\nthe one pellucid and of a light yellowish colour, obtained by simple\r\nincision; the other thick, dark, opaque, and of terebinthinous odour,\r\nprocured by boring the stem and applying fire around the trunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMYRTACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLEUM CAJUPUTI.\r\n\r\n_Oil of Cajuput_, _Kayu-puti Oil_; F. _Essence de Cajuput_; G.\r\n_Cajeputöl_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Melaleuca Leucadendron_ L., a tree often attaining\r\na considerable size, with a thick spongy bark peeling off in layers,\r\nand slender, often pendulous branches.

Yet upon examination, none of these variations are\r\nsufficiently constant or so combined, as to allow of the definition of\r\ndistinct races.\r\n\r\nThe variety growing in Bouro, where the oil of cajuput has been\r\ndistilled ever since the time of Rumphius, and known as _M. minor_\r\nSmith, is described by Lesson, who visited the island in 1823, as a\r\ntree resembling an aged olive, with flowers in little globose white\r\nheads, and a trunk the stout bark of which is composed of numerous\r\nsatiny layers.\r\n\r\n=History=—Rumphius, who passed nearly fifty years in the Dutch\r\npossessions in the East Indies and died at Amboyna in 1702, is the\r\nfirst to give an account of the oil under notice, and of the tree\r\nfrom which it is obtained.[1061] From what he says, it appears that\r\nthe aromatic properties of the tree are well known to the Malays and\r\nJavanese, who were in the habit of steeping its leaves in oil which\r\nthey then impregnated with the smoke of benzoin and other aromatics, so\r\nobtaining an odorous liquid for anointing their heads. They likewise\r\nused cushions stuffed with the leaves, and also laid the latter in\r\nchests to keep away insects.\r\n\r\nThe fragrance of the foliage having thus attracted the attention of\r\nthe Dutch, probably suggested submitting the leaves to distillation.\r\nRumphius narrates how the oil was obtained in very small quantities,\r\nand was regarded as a powerful sudorific.\r\n\r\nIn Europe it appears to have been first noticed by J. M. Lochner,[1062]\r\nof Nürnberg, physician to the German Emperor. About the same time\r\n(1717), a ship’s surgeon, returning from the east, sold a provision\r\nof the oil to the distinguished apothecary Johann Heinrich Link at\r\nLeipzig, who published a notice on it and sold it.[1063] It began\r\nthen to be quoted in the tariffs of other German apothecaries,[1064]\r\nalthough it was still reputed a very rare article in 1726.[1065]\r\nSomewhat larger quantities appear to have been soon imported by\r\nAmsterdam druggists.[1066] In Germany the oil took the name of _Oleum\r\nWittnebianum_, from the recommendations bestowed on it by M. von\r\nWittneben, of Wolfenbüttel, who was much engaged in natural sciences\r\nand long resident in Batavia.[1067] In France and England, it was\r\nhowever scarcely known till the commencement of the present century,\r\nthough it had a place in the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia of 1788. In the\r\n_London Price Current_, we do not find it quoted earlier than 1813,\r\nwhen the price given is 3_s._ to 3_s._ 6_d._ per ounce, with a duty of\r\n2_s._ 4½_d._ per ounce.\r\n\r\n[1060] _Flora Australiensis_, iii.

Bickmore,[1068]\r\nan American traveller who passed three months in the island in 1865,\r\nstates that it produces about 8,000 bottles of the oil annually, and\r\nthat this is almost its only export. The Trade Returns of the Straight\r\nSettlements published at Singapore, show that the largest quantity is\r\nshipped from Celebes, the great island lying west of Bouro.\r\n\r\n[1068] _Travels in the East Indian Archipelago_, Lond. 1868. 282.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Oil of Cajuput is a transparent mobile fluid, of a\r\nlight bluish-green hue, a fragrant camphoraceous odour, and bitterish\r\naromatic taste. It has a sp. gr. of 0·926, and remains liquid even at\r\n(8°·6 F.)-13° C. It deviates the ray of polarized light to the left. On\r\ndiluting it with bisulphide of carbon it becomes turbid.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The researches of Schmidl (1860) and of\r\nGladstone (1872) have shown that cajuput oil consists chiefly of\r\n_Hydrate of Cajuputene_ or _Cajuputol_, C₁₀H₁₆, H₂O, which may be\r\nobtained from the crude oil by fractional distillation at 174° C. If it\r\nis repeatedly distilled from anhydrous phosphoric acid, _Cajuputene_,\r\nC₁₀H₁₆, passes over at 160-165° C.; it has an agreeable odour of\r\nhyacinths. After the cajuputene, _Isocajuputene_ distils at 177°,\r\nand _Paracajuputene_ at 310-316°, both agreeing in composition with\r\ncajuputene.\r\n\r\nLike most essential oils having the formula C₁₀H₁₆, crude cajuput oil\r\nis capable of forming the crystallized compound C₁₀H₁₆, 3OH₂. This\r\nwe have abundantly obtained by mixing 4 parts of the oil with 1 of\r\nalcohol 0·830 sp. gr., and one part of nitric acid 1·20 sp. gr.; the\r\nmixture should be allowed to stand in shallow dishes. By adding 1 vol.\r\nof absolute alcohol to 3 vol. of cajuput oil, and saturating it with\r\nanhydrous hydrochloric gas, crystals of the compound C₁₀H₁₆(HCl)₂ may\r\nbe obtained. By vapour of bromine the oil acquires a beautiful green\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nIf 1 part of iodine be gradually dissolved in cajuput oil, the\r\ntemperature being maintained at 50° C., fine green crystals of\r\n(C₁₀H₁₆HI)₂OH₂ are formed. They may be recrystallized from very little\r\nglacial acetic acid, but will not keep for more than a few weeks.\r\n\r\nThe green tint of the oil is due to copper, a minute proportion of\r\nwhich metal is usually present in all that is imported. It may be\r\nmade evident by agitating the oil with water acidulated by a little\r\nhydrochloric acid. The compounds of copper with inorganic acids being\r\ncomparatively of a fainter colour than the cupric salts of organic\r\nacids, the aqueous solution of chloride of copper now formed displays\r\nno longer the fine green tint. To the solution, after it has been\r\nput into a platinum capsule, a little zinc should be added, when the\r\ncopper will be immediately deposited on the platinum. The liquid may be\r\nthen poured off and the copper dissolved and tested. When the oil is\r\nrectified, it is obtained colourless, but it readily becomes green if\r\nin contact for a short time with metallic copper. The presence of the\r\nmetal in the oil may also be shown at once by a scrap of paper which\r\nhas been impregnated with fresh tincture of guaiacum wood and dried. If\r\nit is then moistened with water containing 1 per cent. of sulphocyanate\r\nof potassium, the paper turns intensely blue by the contact with the\r\noil provided the latter contains copper.\r\n\r\nGuibourt[1069] has however proved by experiment that the volatile\r\noil obtained by the distillation of the leaves of several species of\r\n_Melaleuca_, _Metrosideros_ and _Eucalyptus_, has naturally a fine\r\ngreen hue. It is not improbable that this hue is transient, and that\r\nthe contamination with copper is intentional in order to obtain a\r\npermanent green.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The oil is imported from Singapore and Batavia, packed in\r\nglass beer or wine bottles. From official statements[1070] it appears\r\nthat the imports into Singapore during 1871 were as under:—\r\n\r\n    From Java            445 gallons\r\n      ”  Manilla         200    ”\r\n      ”  Celebes       3,895    ”\r\n      ”  other places    350    ”\r\n                       -----\r\n               Total   4,890    ”\r\n                       -----\r\n\r\nOf this large quantity, the greater portion was re-shipped to Bombay,\r\nCalcutta, and Cochin China.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Cajuput oil is occasionally administered internally as a\r\nstimulant, antispasmodic and diaphoretic: externally as a rubefacient\r\nit is in frequent use.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—The oil of _Eucalyptus oleosa_ F. Muell. has, we find,\r\nthe odour of cajuput; and according to Gladstone it agrees, as well\r\nas the oils of _Melaleuca ericifolia_ Sm. and _M. linariifolia_ Sm.,\r\nalmost entirely with cajuput oil, except in optical properties. The\r\nsame is probably the case with the oil of _Eucalyptus globulus_ Labill,\r\nwhich Cloez (1870) states to be dextrogyre. These oils are shipped to\r\nsome extent from Australia to Europe, probably as adulterants of other\r\nessential oils.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARYOPHYLLI.\r\n\r\n_Cloves_; F. _Girofles_, _Clous de Girofles_; G. _Gewürznelken_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Eugenia caryophyllata_ Thunberg (_Caryophyllus\r\naromaticus_ L.), a beautiful evergreen tree, 30 to 40 feet high,\r\nresembling a gigantic myrtle, bearing numerous flowers grouped in small\r\nterminal tricotomous cymes. The flower has an inferior ovary about ½ an\r\ninch long, cylindrical, of a crimson colour, dividing at the top into 4\r\nsepals; and 4 round concave petals larger than the calyx, imbricated in\r\nthe bud like a globe, but at length spreading and soon dropping off.\r\n\r\nThe clove-tree is said to be strictly indigenous only in the five\r\nsmall islands constituting the proper Moluccas, namely Tarnati, Tidor,\r\nMortir, Makiyan and Bachian.[1071] These form a chain on the west side\r\nof the large island of Jilolo, where, strange to say, the tree appears\r\nnot to exist in a wild state (Crawfurd). According to Rumphius, it\r\nwas introduced into Amboyna before the arrival of the Portuguese, and\r\nis still cultivated there and in the neighbouring islands of Haruku,\r\nSaparua and Nusalaut, also in Sumatra and Penang. It is likewise now\r\nfound in Malacca, the Mascarene Islands, the islands of Zanzibar and\r\nPemba on the eastern coast of Africa, and the West Indies.\r\n\r\n[1069] _Hist. des Drog._ iii. (1869) 278.\r\n\r\n[1070] _Blue Book of the Colony of the Straits Settlements_ for 1871,\r\nSingapore, 1872.\r\n\r\n[1071] Though these are the original Moluccas or Clove Islands, the\r\nname has been extended to all islands east of Celebes and west of New\r\nGuinea.\r\n\r\nThe tree which is grown for the spice appears to be a cultivated\r\nvariety, of lower stature and more aromatic than the wild form.\r\n\r\n=History=[1072]—The Greek name Καρυόϕυλλον is supposed to refer to\r\nthe ball-like _petals_ of the bud, which, as above described, might\r\nbe compared to a small nut (κάρυον). But the name is very variably\r\nwritten, as γαροῦμϕουλ, καρϕούϕουλ, γαρόϕαλα,[1073] whence it becomes\r\nprobable that it is not really Greek, but an Asiatic word hellenized.\r\n\r\nCloves have been long known to the Chinese. Mr. Mayers, late Chinese\r\nSecretary to the British Legation at Pekin, has communicated to us the\r\ninteresting fact that they are mentioned by several Chinese writers as\r\nin use under the Han dynasty, B.C. 266 to A.D. 220, during which period\r\nit was customary for the officers of the court to hold the spice in the\r\nmouth before addressing the sovereign, in order that their breath might\r\nhave an agreeable odour.[1074]\r\n\r\nThe Sanskrit name is “_Lavanga_,” whence the vernacular Hindustani\r\n“_Laung_.”\r\n\r\nThe first European author to mention _Caryophyllon_ is Pliny, who\r\ndescribes it, after _pepper_, as a grain resembling that spice but\r\nlonger and more brittle, produced in India, and imported for the sake\r\nof its odour. It is doubtful whether this description really refers to\r\ncloves.\r\n\r\nBy the 4th century, cloves must have become well known in Europe,\r\nif credence can be placed in a remarkable record preserved by\r\nVignoli,[1075] which states that the emperor Constantine presented to\r\nSt. Silvester, bishop of Rome, A.D. 314-335, numerous vessels of gold\r\nand silver, incense and spices, among which last were 150 pounds of\r\n_Cloves_—a vast quantity for the period.\r\n\r\nKosmas Indicopleustes,[1076] in his _Topographia Christiana_ written\r\nabout A.D. 547, states in the account of Taprobane (Ceylon) that silk,\r\naloes [-wood], cloves (Καρυόϕυλλον) and sandal-wood, besides other\r\nproductions, are imported thither from China, and other emporia, and\r\ntransmitted to distant regions. Alexander Trallianus,[1077] who was\r\na friend of Kosmos and a pupil of his father, prescribed in several\r\nreceipts 5 or 8 cloves, καρυοϕυλλου κόκκους, from which fact it may be\r\ninferred that at his time (at Rome?) cloves were a very rare article.\r\nA century later, Paulus Ægineta[1078] distinctly described cloves as\r\n_Caryophyllon_—_ex India, veluti flores cujusdam arboris.. odorati,\r\nacres_ ... and much used for a condiment and in medicine.\r\n\r\n[1072] For the history of the oil see our article Cortex Cinnamon,\r\nchemical composition.\r\n\r\n[1073] Langkavel, _Botanik der späteren Griechen_, Berlin, 1866. 19.\r\n\r\n[1074] At this period, the clove was called _Ki shêh hiang_, i.e.\r\n_fowl’s tongue spice_. The modern name _Ting hiang_, i.e. _nail-scent_\r\nor-_spice_, was in use in the 5th or 6th century of our era.\r\n\r\n[1075] _Liber Pontificalis, seu de Gestis Romanorum Pontificum_, Romæ,\r\ni.

But it was very costly: the Household Book of the Countess\r\nof Leicester, A.D. 1265,[1085] gives its price as 10_s._ to 12_s._ per\r\nlb., exactly the same as that of saffron. Several other examples of the\r\nhigh cost of the spice might be adduced.\r\n\r\nOf the place of growth of cloves, the first distinct notice seems to be\r\nthat of the Arabian geographer Ibn Khurdádbah,[1086] A.D. 869-885, who\r\nnames the spice, with cocoa-nuts, sugar, and sandal-wood as produced in\r\nJava. Doubtless he was misinformed, for the clove-tree had not come so\r\nfar west at that period. Marco Polo[1087] made the same mistake four\r\ncenturies later: finding the spice in Java, he supposed it the growth\r\nof the island.\r\n\r\nNicolo Conti,[1088] a Venetian merchant who lived from A.D. 1424 to\r\n1448 in the Indian Archipelago, learned that cloves are brought to\r\nJava from the island of Banda, fifteen days’ sail further east. With\r\nthe arrival of the Portuguese at the commencement of the 16th century,\r\nmore accurate accounts of the Spice Islands began to reach Europe;\r\nand Pigafetta,[1089] the companion of Magellan, gave a very good\r\ndescription of the clove-tree as he observed it in 1521.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese had the principal share in the clove trade for nearly a\r\ncentury. In 1605 they were expelled by the Dutch, who took exclusive\r\npossession of the Moluccas and adopted extraordinary measures for\r\nkeeping the traffic in their own hands. Yet notwithstanding this, large\r\nsupplies of cloves reached England direct. In 1609 a ship of the East\r\nIndia Company called the _Consent_ arrived with 112,000 lb., the duty\r\non which amounted to £1400 and the impost to as much more. The spice\r\nungarbled was sold at 5_s._ 6_d._ and 5_s._ 9_d._ per lb.—of course, in\r\nbond.[1090]\r\n\r\n[1079] _Poematium Medicum_—Migne, _Patrologiæ Cursus_, lxxxix.

This policy, the object of which was to\r\nconfine the growth of the spice to a group of small islands of which\r\nAmboyna is the largest, has but very recently been abandoned: though\r\nthe cultivation of the spice was free in all other localities, the\r\n_clove parks_ of the Amboyna islands remained the property of the Dutch\r\nGovernment. The original Moluccas or Clove Islands now produce no\r\ncloves at all.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise of Poivre, the French governor of Mauritius and\r\nBourbon, so far eluded the vigilance of the Dutch, that both clove and\r\nnutmeg-trees were introduced into those islands in the year 1770.[1091]\r\nThe clove-tree was carried thence to Cayenne in 1793, and to Zanzibar\r\nabout the end of the century.\r\n\r\nCrawfurd,[1092] in an excellent article of which we have made free use,\r\naptly remarks that it is difficult to understand how the clove first\r\ncame to the notice of foreign nations, considering the well ascertained\r\nfact that it has never been used as a condiment or in any other way by\r\nthe inhabitants of the islands of which it is a native. We may observe\r\nhowever that there were some singular superstitions among the islanders\r\nwith regard to the so-called _Royal Clove_ (p. 287), a tree of which on\r\nthe island of Makiyan was long supposed to be unique.\r\n\r\n=Collection=—The flower-buds of the clove-tree when young are nearly\r\nwhite, but afterwards become green and lastly bright red, when they\r\nmust at once be gathered. This in Zanzibar is done by hand; each clove\r\nis picked singly, a moveable stage the height of the tree being used\r\nto enable the labourers to reach the upper branches. The buds are then\r\nsimply dried in the sun, by which they acquire the familiar dark brown\r\ntint of the commercial article. The gathering takes place twice a year;\r\nin the Moluccas where the harvest occurs in June and December, the\r\ncloves are partly gathered by hand, and partly beaten off the tree by\r\nbamboos on to cloths spread beneath. The annual yield of a good tree is\r\nabout 4½ pounds, but sometimes reaches double that quantity.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Cloves are about ⁶/₁₀ of an inch in length, and consist\r\nof a long cylindrical calyx dividing above into 4 pointed spreading\r\nsepals which surround 4 petals, closely imbricated as a globular bud\r\nabout ²/₁₀ of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe petals which are of lighter colour than the rest of the drug and\r\nsomewhat translucent from numerous oil-cells, spring from the base of\r\na 4-sided epigynous disc, the angles of which are directed towards the\r\nlobes of the calyx. The stamens which are very numerous, are inserted\r\nat the base of the petals and are arched over the style. The latter\r\nwhich is short and subulate, rises from a depression in the centre of\r\nthe disc. Immediately below it and united with the upper portion of\r\nthe calyx is the ovary, which is 2-celled and contains many ovules.\r\nThe lower end of the calyx (_hypanthium_) has a compressed form; it\r\nis solid but has its internal tissue far more porous than the walls.\r\nThe whole calyx is of a deep rich brown, has a dull wrinkled surface,\r\na dense fleshy texture, and abounds in essential oil which exudes on\r\nsimple pressure with the nail. Cloves have an agreeable spicy odour,\r\nand a strong biting aromatic taste.\r\n\r\n[1091] Tessier, _Sur l’importation du Giroflier des Moluques aux\r\nIsles de France, de Bourbon et de Sechelles, et de ces isles à\r\nCayenne_.—_Observations sur la physique_, Paris, Juillet, 1779.\r\n\r\n[1092] _Dictionary of the Indian Islands_, 1856, article _Clove_.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of cloves occurring in commerce do not exhibit any\r\nstructural differences. Inferior kinds are distinguished by being less\r\nplump, less bright in tint, and less rich in essential oil. In London\r\nprice-currents, cloves are enumerated in the order of value thus:\r\nPenang, Bencoolen, Amboyna, Zanzibar.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—A transverse section of the lower part of a\r\nclove shows a dark rhomboid zone, the tissue on either side of which\r\nis of a lighter hue. The outer layer beneath the epidermis exhibits a\r\nlarge number of oil-cells, frequently as much as 300 mkm. in diameter.\r\nAbout 200 oil-cells may be counted in one transverse section, so that\r\nthe large amount of essential oil in the drug is well shown by its\r\nmicroscopic characters. The above-mentioned zone is chiefly made up of\r\nabout 30 fibro-vascular bundles, another stronger bundle traversing the\r\ncentre of the clove. The fibro-vascular bundles, as well as the tissue\r\nbordering the oil-cells, assume a greenish black hue by alcoholic\r\nperchloride of iron. Oil-cells are also largely distributed in the\r\nleaves, petals and even the stamens of Eugenia.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Few plants possess any organ so rich in\r\nessential oil as the drug under consideration. The oil known in\r\npharmacy as _Oleum Caryophylli_, which is the important constituent\r\nof cloves, is obtainable to the extent of 16 to 20 per cent. But to\r\nextract the whole, the distillation must be long continued, the water\r\nbeing returned to the same material.\r\n\r\nThe oil is a colourless or yellowish liquid with a powerful odour\r\nand taste of cloves, sp. gr. 1·046 to 1·058. It is a mixture of a\r\nhydrocarbon, and an oxygenated oil called _Eugenol_, in variable\r\nproportions. The former which is termed _light oil of cloves_ and comes\r\nover in the first period of the distillation, has the composition\r\nC₁₅H₂₄, a sp. gr. of 0·918 and boils at 251° C. It deviates the plane\r\nof polarization slightly to the left, and is not coloured on addition\r\nof ferric chloride; it is of a rather terebinthinaceous odour.\r\n\r\nEugenol, sometimes called _Eugenic Acid_, has a sp. gr. of 1·087 at 0°\r\nC., and possesses the full taste and smell of cloves. Its boiling point\r\nis 247°·5 C. With alkalis, especially ammonia and baryta, it yields\r\ncrystallizable salts. Eugenol may therefore be prepared by submitting\r\nthe crude oil of cloves to distillation with caustic soda; the “light\r\noil” distils then, the eugenol, being now combined with sodium, remains\r\nin the still. It will be obtained on addition of an acid and again\r\ndistilling. Eugenol is devoid of rotatory power, whence the crude oil\r\nof cloves, of which eugenol is by far the prevailing constituent, is\r\noptically almost inactive. The constitution of eugenol is given by the\r\n\r\n                   {OCH₃\r\n    formula C₆H₃   {OH        .\r\n                   {CH·CH·CH₃\r\n\r\nIt belongs to the phenol class, and has also been met with in the\r\nfruits of Pimenta officinalis (see next article), in the Bay leaves, in\r\nCanella bark (see page 75), in the leaves and flower buds of Cinnamomum\r\nzeilanicum and in Brazilian clove-bark (_Dicypellium caryophyllatum_\r\nNees).\r\n\r\nEugenol can be converted into _Vanillin_ (see Fructus Vanillæ).\r\n\r\nThe water distilled from cloves is stated to contain, in addition to\r\nthe essential oil, another body, _Eugenin_, which sometimes separates\r\nafter a while in the form of tasteless, crystalline laminæ, having the\r\nsame composition as eugenol.[1093] We have never met with it.\r\n\r\nAccording to Scheuch (1863), oil of cloves also (sometimes) contains a\r\nlittle _Salicylic acid_,\r\n\r\n         {OH\r\n    C₆H₄ {     ,\r\n         {COOH\r\n\r\nwhich may be removed by shaking the oil with a solution of carbonate of\r\nammonium.\r\n\r\n_Caryophyllin_, C₂₀H₃₂O, is a neutral, tasteless, inodorous substance,\r\ncrystallizing in needle-shaped prisms. We have obtained it in small\r\nquantity, by treating with boiling ether cloves, which we had\r\npreviously deprived of most of their essential oil by small quantities\r\nof alcohol. E. Mylius (1873) obtained from it by nitric acid, crystals\r\nof _Caryophyllinic Acid_, C₂₀H₃₂O₆.\r\n\r\n_Carmufellic Acid_ obtained in colourless crystals, C₁₂H₂₀O₁₆, in 1851\r\nby Muspratt and Danson after digesting an aqueous extract of cloves\r\nwith nitric acid, is a product of this treatment and not a natural\r\nconstituent of cloves.\r\n\r\nCloves contain a considerable proportion of gum; also a tannic acid not\r\nyet particularly examined.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—Of late years the principal locality for\r\nthe production of cloves has been the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba\r\non the east coast of Africa, which until very recently were capable\r\nof producing a maximum crop of 10½ millions of pounds in a single\r\nseason. On the 15th April 1872, Zanzibar was visited by a hurricane of\r\nextraordinary violence, by which about five-sixths of the clove-trees\r\nin the island were destroyed; and although the plantations are being\r\nrenewed, many years must elapse before the crop can resume its\r\nformer importance. Pemba, which is distant from Zanzibar 25 miles,\r\nand produced about half as much of the spice as that island, did not\r\nappreciably suffer from the storm.\r\n\r\nThe crop on these islands fluctuates, a good year alternating with a\r\nbad one. This is partly shown in the imports of Bombay, the great mart\r\nof Zanzibar produce, which have been as follows:—\r\n\r\n      1869-70       1870-71       1871-72       1872-73\r\n    45,642 cwt.   21,968 cwt.   43,891 cwt.   25,185 cwt.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of cloves shipped from Bombay to the United Kingdom is\r\ncomparatively small, being in 1871-72, 3279 cwt.; in 1872-73, 3271 cwt.\r\n\r\nThe imports of cloves to the United Kingdom are from one million to\r\nfour million pounds annually.\r\n\r\nCloves are also largely shipped direct from Zanzibar to the United\r\nStates and Hamburg. A small amount is taken in native vessels to the\r\nRed Sea ports; these are packed in raw hides. Those for the European\r\nand American markets are shipped in mat bags made of split cocoa-nut\r\nleaf.\r\n\r\n[1093] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, xiv. (1860) 201.\r\n\r\nThe clove trade of the Moluccas has been for many years in the hands\r\nof the Dutch Government, which, by its restrictive policy, assumed\r\npractically the position of growers, disposing of their produce through\r\nthe Netherlands Trading Company at auctions held in Holland twice a\r\nyear. This system having been abolished in 1872, has proved disastrous\r\nto the trade it was designed to protect, and to such a degree that the\r\nproduce of cloves in the Moluccas is but a tenth of what it was in\r\nthe early days of their intercourse with Europe. The crop of the four\r\nislands, Amboyna, Haruku, Saparua, and Nusalaut, the only Moluccas in\r\nwhich the tree is cultivated, was reckoned in 1854 as 510,912 lb.\r\n\r\nThe export of cloves from Java in 1871 was 1397 peculs[1094] (186,226\r\nlb.). The French island of Réunion which from 1825 to 1849 used to\r\nproduce annually as much as 800,000 kilogrammes (1,764,571 lb.), now\r\nyields almost none, owing chiefly to the frequent hurricanes.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—As a remedy, cloves are unimportant, though in the form of\r\ninfusion or distilled water they are useful in combination with other\r\nmedicines. The essential oil which sometimes relieves toothache is a\r\nfrequent ingredient of pill-masses. The chief consumption of cloves is\r\nas a culinary spice.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—1. _Clove Stalks_—_Festucœlvel Stipites Caryophylli_, in\r\nFrench _Griffes de Girofle_, in German _Nelkenstiele_, were an article\r\nof import into Europe during the middle ages, when they were chiefly\r\nknown by their low Latin name of _fusti_, or the Italian _bastaroni_.\r\nThus under the statutes of Pisa,[1095] A.D. 1305, duty was levied not\r\nonly on cloves (_garofali_), but also on _Folia et fusti garofalorum_.\r\nPegolotti[1096] a little later names both as being articles of trade at\r\nConstantinople. Clove _Leaves_ are enumerated[1097] as an import into\r\nPalestine in the 12th century; they are also mentioned in a list of the\r\ndrugs sold at Frankfort[1098] about the year 1450; we are not aware\r\nthat they are used in modern times.\r\n\r\nAs to Clove Stalks, they are still a considerable object of trade,\r\nespecially from Zanzibar, where they are called by the natives\r\n_Vikunia_. They taste tolerably aromatic, and yield 4 to 6·4 per cent.\r\nof volatile levogyre oil; they are used for adulterating the _Ground\r\nCloves_ sold by grocers. Such an admixture may be detected by the\r\nmicroscope, especially if the powder after treatment with potash be\r\nexamined in glycerin. If clove stalks have been ground, thick-walled\r\nor stone-cells will be found in the powder; such cells do not occur in\r\ncloves. Powdered allspice is also an adulterant of powdered cloves; it\r\nalso contains stone-cells, but in addition numerous starch granules\r\nwhich are entirely wanting in cloves.\r\n\r\n2. _Mother Cloves, Anthophylli_—are the _fruits_ of the clove-tree,\r\nand are ovate-oblong berries about an inch in length and much less\r\nrich in essential oil than cloves. Though occasionally seen in the\r\nLondon drug sales in some quantity, they are not an article of regular\r\nimport.[1099] As they contain very large starch granules, their\r\npresence as an adulteration of ground cloves would be revealed by the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\n[1094] _Consular Reports_, Aug. 1873. 952.\r\n\r\n[1095] Bonaini, _Statuti inediti della città di Pisa dal xii. al xiv.\r\nsecolo_, iii.

In Jamaica, it\r\nprefers limestone hills near the sea, and is especially plentiful on\r\nthe north side of the island.\r\n\r\n=History=—The high value placed on the spices of India sufficiently\r\nexplains the interest with which aromatic and pungent plants were\r\nregarded by the early explorers of the New World; while the eager\r\ndesire to obtain these lucrative commodities is shown by the names\r\n_Pepper_, _Cinnamon_, _Balsam_, _Melegueta_, _Amomum_, bestowed on\r\nproductions totally distinct from those originally so designated.\r\n\r\nAmong the spices thus brought to the notice of Europe were the\r\nlittle dry berries of certain trees of the myrtle tribe, which had\r\nsome resemblance in shape and flavour to peppercorns, and hence were\r\nnamed _Pimienta_,[1102] corrupted to _Pimenta_ or _Pimento_. It was\r\ndoubtless a drug of this kind, if not our veritable allspice, that\r\nwas given to Clusius in 1601 by Garret, a druggist of London, and\r\ndescribed and figured by the former in his _Liber Exoticorum_.[1103]\r\nA few years later it began to be imported into England, being, as\r\nParkinson[1104] says, “obtruded for _Amomum_” (_Round Cardamom_), so\r\nthat “some more audacious than wise ... put it in their compositions\r\ninstead of the right.” Francesco Redi mentioned the fruits as\r\n_Pimienta de Chapa_; Chiapas, now the south-eastern department of\r\nMexico, bordering Guatemala. Redi states that the spice was also\r\ncalled _Pimienta de Tavasco_ from the adjoining department of Tabasco.\r\nAccording to Sloane[1105] (1691) it was commonly sold by druggists for\r\n_Carpobalsamum_. Ray (1693) distinguished the spice as a production of\r\nJamaica under the name of _Sweet-scented Jamaica Pepper_ or _Allspice_,\r\nand states it to be abundantly imported into England, and in frequent\r\nuse as a condiment, though not employed in medicine. The spice had a\r\nplace in the London Pharmacopœia as early as 1721.\r\n\r\n[1100] Rumphius in his letter from Amboina, Sept. 20, 1696, to Dr.\r\nSchröck, in _Ephemerides Acad. Cæs. Leopold.

In the year 1804-5,\r\nthe quantity shipped from the British West Indies was 2,257,000 lb.,\r\nproducing on import duty a net revenue of £38,063.[1106]\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—The spice found in commerce is furnished\r\nwholly by the island of Jamaica. A plantation, there called a _Pimento\r\nwalk_, is a piece of natural woodland stocked with the trees, which\r\nrequire but little attention. The flowers appear in June, July, and\r\nAugust, and are quickly succeeded by the berries, which are gathered\r\nwhen of full size but still unripe. This is performed by breaking off\r\nthe small twigs bearing the bunches. These are then spread out, and\r\nexposed to the sun and air for some days, after which the stalks are\r\nremoved, and the berries are fit for being packed.\r\n\r\nBy an official document[1107] it appears that, in the year 1871, the\r\namount of land in Jamaica cropped with pimento was 7,178 acres. In that\r\nyear the island exported of the spice 6,857,838 lb., value £28,574. Of\r\nthis quantity Great Britain took 4,287,551 lb., and the United States\r\n2,266,950 lb. In 1875 the export was 57,500 cwts., valued at £40,250,\r\nof which 10,894 cwts. only went to the United States.\r\n\r\n[1106] _Parliamentary Return_, March 1805, quoted in Young’s _West\r\nIndia Commonplace Book_, 1807. 79.\r\n\r\n[1107] _Blue Book_ for Jamaica, printed 1872.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Allspice is a small, dry globular berry, rather variable\r\nin size, measuring ³/₁₀ to less than ²/₁₀ of an inch in diameter. It is\r\ncrowned by a short style, seated in a depression, and surrounded by 4\r\nshort thick sepals; generally however the latter have been rubbed off,\r\na scar-like raised ring marking their former position. The berry has a\r\nwoody shell or pericarp, easily cut, of a dark ferruginous brown, and\r\nrugose by reason of minute tubercles filled with essential oil. It is\r\ntwo-celled, each cell containing a single, reniform, exalbuminous seed,\r\nhaving a large spirally curved embryo. The seed is aromatic, but less\r\nso than the pericarp.\r\n\r\nAllspice has an agreeable, pungent, spicy flavour, much resembling that\r\nof cloves.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The outer layer of the pericarp, immediately\r\nbeneath the epidermis, contains numerous large cells filled with\r\nessential oil. The parenchyme further exhibits thick-walled cells\r\nloaded with resin, and smaller cells enclosing crystals of oxalate of\r\ncalcium. The whole tissue is traversed by small fibro-vascular bundles.\r\nThe seeds are also provided with a small number of oil-cells, and\r\ncontain starch granules.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The composition of pimento resembles in many\r\npoints that of cloves. The berries yield to the extent of 3 to 4½\r\nper cent. a volatile oil, sp. gr. 1·037 (Gladstone), having the\r\ncharacteristic taste and odour of the spice, and known in the shops as\r\n_Oleum Pimentæ_. We have found it to deviate the ray of polarized light\r\n2° to the left, when examined in a column of 50 mm.\r\n\r\nOeser (1864), whose experiments have been confirmed by Gladstone\r\n(1872), has shown that oil of pimento has substantially the same\r\ncomposition as oil of cloves; salicylic acid has not been found.\r\nPimento is rich in tannin, striking with a persalt of iron an inky\r\nblack. Its decoction is coloured deep blue by iodine, showing the\r\npresence of starch. Dragendorff (1871) pointed out the existence in\r\nallspice of an extremely small quantity of an alkaloid, having somewhat\r\nthe odour of coniine.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Employed as an aromatic clove; a distilled water (_Aqua\r\nPimentæ_) is frequently prescribed. The chief use of pimento is as a\r\nculinary spice.\r\n\r\n=Substitute=—The Mexican spice called _Pimienta de Tabasco_ (_Piment\r\nTabago_ Guibourt) is somewhat larger and less aromatic than Jamaica\r\nallspice. Analogous products are afforded by _Pimenta acris_\r\nWight[1108] (_Myrcia acris_ DC, _Amomis acris_ Berg), the _Bay-berry_\r\ntree, and _P. Pimento_ Griseb. The oil of bay-berry consists of eugenol\r\nand a hydrocarbon, possibly identical with the “light oil of cloves”\r\n(p. 284), but present in a larger amount. _Bay rum_, much used in the\r\nUnited States by the perfumers, is an alcoholic tincture flavoured with\r\noil of bay-berry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANATEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTEX GRANATI FRUCTUS.\r\n\r\n_Cortex Granati_; _Pomegranate Peel_; F. _Ecorce de Grenades_; G.\r\n_Granatschalen_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Punica Granatum_ L., a shrub or low tree, with\r\nsmall deciduous foliage and handsome scarlet flowers. It is indigenous\r\nto North-western India, and the counties south and south-west of the\r\nCaspian to the Persian Gulf and Palestine, and grows wild in the hills\r\nof Western Sindh in elevations of 4000 feet, in Balutchistan to 6000\r\nfeet, also in the east flank of Soliman range. The trunk is short,\r\nrarely over 20 feet high. The tree has long been cultivated, and is\r\nnow found throughout the warm parts of Europe, and in the subtropical\r\nregions of both hemispheres.\r\n\r\n=History=—The pomegranate has been highly prized by mankind from\r\nthe remotest antiquity, as is shown by the references to it in the\r\nScriptures,[1109] and by the numerous representations of the fruit in\r\nthe sculptures of Persepolis and Assyria,[1110] and on the ancient\r\nmonuments of Egypt.[1111] It was probably introduced into the south\r\nof Italy by Greek colonists, and is named as a common fruit-tree by\r\nPorcius Cato[1112] in the 3rd century B.C. The peel of the fruit was\r\nrecognized as medicinal by the ancients, and among the Romans was in\r\ncommon use for tanning leather,[1113] as it still is in Tunis.\r\n\r\n[1108] Figured in Bentley and Trimen, part 20.—The fruit of this\r\nspecies is easily distinguished, being crowned by 5-calyx lobes.\r\n\r\n[1109] _Exodus_ xxviii. 33, 34; _Numbers_ xx. 2; _Deut._ viii 8;\r\n_Cant._ iv. 13; viii. 2.\r\n\r\n[1110] Layard, _Nineveh and its Remains_, ed. 5, ii.

(1837) 142.\r\n\r\n[1112] Nisard’s edition, Paris, 1877, capp. 7. 127. 133.\r\n\r\n[1113] See also Hehn, _Kulturpflanzen_, Berlin, 1877, 206.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit of the pomegranate tree is a spherical,\r\nsomewhat flattened and obscurely six-sided berry, the size of a common\r\norange and often much larger, crowned by the thick, tubular, 5-to\r\n9-toothed calyx. It has a smooth, hard, coriaceous skin, which when the\r\nfruit is ripe, is of a brownish yellow tint, often finely shaded with\r\nred. Membranous dissepiments, about 6 in number meeting in the axis of\r\nthe fruit, divide the upper and larger portion into equal cells. Below\r\nthese a confused conical diaphragm separates the lower and smaller\r\nhalf, which in its turn is divided into 4 or 5 irregular cells. Each\r\ncell is filled with a large number of grains, crowded on thick spongy\r\nplacentæ, which in the upper cells are parietal but in the lower appear\r\nto be central. The grains, which are about ½ an inch in length, are\r\noblong or obconical and many-sided, and consist of a thin transparent\r\nvesicle containing an acid, saccharine, red, juicy pulp, surrounding an\r\nelongated angular seed.\r\n\r\nThe only part of the fruit used medicinally is the peel, _Cortex\r\nGranati_ of the druggists, which in the fresh state is leathery. When\r\ndry as imported, it is in irregular, more or less concave fragments,\r\nsome of which have the toothed, tubular calyx still enclosing the\r\nstamens and style. It is ⅒ to ¹/₂₀ of an inch thick, easily breaking\r\nwith a short corky fracture; externally it is rather rough, of a\r\nyellowish-brown or reddish colour. Internally it is more or less brown\r\nor yellow, and honey-combed with depressions left by the seeds. It has\r\nhardly any odour, but has a strongly astringent taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The middle layer of the peel consists of large\r\nthin-walled and elongated, sometimes even branched cells, among which\r\noccur thick-walled cells and fibro-vascular bundles. Both the outer\r\nand the inner surface are made up of smaller, nearly cubic and densely\r\npacked cells. Small starch granules occur sparingly throughout the\r\ntissue, as well as crystals of oxalate of calcium.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The chief constituent is tannin, which in an\r\naqueous infusion of the dried peel produces with perchloride of iron\r\nan abundant dark blue precipitate. The peel also contains sugar and a\r\nlittle gum. Dried at 100° C. and incinerated, it yielded us 5·9 per\r\ncent. of ash.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Pomegranate peel is an excellent astringent, now almost obsolete\r\nin British medicine. Waring[1114] asserts that when combined with opium\r\nand an aromatic, as cloves, it is a most useful remedy in the chronic\r\ndysentery of the natives of India, as well as in diarrhœa.\r\n\r\n[1114] _Pharm. of India_, 1868. 93. 447.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTEX GRANATI RADICIS.\r\n\r\n_Pomegranate-root Bark_; F. _Ecorce de racine de Grenadier_; G.\r\n_Granatwurzelrinde_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Punica Granatum_ L., see page 289.\r\n\r\n=History=—In addition to the particulars regarding the pomegranate\r\ntree given in the preceding article, the following which concern the\r\ndrug under notice may be stated.\r\n\r\nA decoction of the root of the pomegranate was recommended by\r\nCelsus,[1115] Dioscorides,[1116] and Pliny[1117] for the expulsion\r\nof tapeworm; but the remedy had fallen into complete oblivion, until\r\nits use among the Hindus attracted the notice of Buchanan[1118] at\r\nCalcutta about the year 1805. This physician pointed out the efficacy\r\nof the root-bark, which was further shown by Fleming and others.\r\nPomegranate-root is known to have been long used for a similar purpose\r\nby the Chinese.[1119]\r\n\r\nThough the medicine is admitted to be efficient, and is employed with\r\nadvantage in India where it is easily procured both genuine and fresh,\r\nit is hardly ever administered in England, the extract of male-fern\r\nbeing generally preferred; but it has a place in several continental\r\npharmacopœias.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The bark occurs in rather thin quills or fragments, 3\r\nto 4 inches long. Their outer surface is yellowish-grey, sometimes\r\nmarked with fine longitudinal striations or reticulated wrinkles, but\r\nmore often furrowed by bands of cork, running together in the thickest\r\npieces into broad flat conchoidal scales. The inner surface, which is\r\nsmooth or marked with fine striæ and is of a greyish yellow, has often\r\nstrips of the tough whitish wood attached to it. The bark breaks short\r\nand granular; it has a purely astringent taste, but scarcely any odour.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—On a transverse section, the liber is seen to\r\nbe the prevailing part of the cortical tissue. The former consists of\r\nalternating layers of two kinds of cells—one of them loaded with tufted\r\ncrystals of oxalate of calcium, the other filled with starch granules\r\nand tannic matter. The bark is traversed by narrow medullary rays, and\r\nvery large sclerenchymatous cells are scattered through the liber.\r\nTouched with a dilute solution of a persalt of iron, the bark assumes a\r\ndark blackish blue tint.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The bark contains, according to Wackenroder\r\n(1824), more than 22 per cent. of tannic acid, which Rembold (1867)\r\nhas ascertained to consist for the most part of a peculiar variety\r\ncalled _Punico-tannic Acid_, C₂₀H₁₆O₁₃; when boiled with dilute\r\nsulphuric acid, it is resolved into _Ellagic Acid_, C₁₄H₈O₉, and sugar.\r\nPunico-tannic acid is accompanied by common tannic acid, yielding,\r\nby means of sulphuric acid, gallic acid, which appears sometimes\r\nto pre-exist in the bark. If a decoction of pomegranate bark is\r\nprecipitated by acetate of lead, and the lead is separated from the\r\nfiltered liquid, the latter on evaporation yields a considerable amount\r\nof mannite. This is probably the _Punicin_ or _Granatin_ of former\r\nobservers.\r\n\r\n[1115] _De Medicina_, lib. iv. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[1116] Lib. i. c. 153.\r\n\r\n[1117] Lib. xxiii. c. 60.\r\n\r\n[1118] _Edinb. Med. and Surg. Journ._, iii. (1807) 22.\r\n\r\n[1119] Debeaux, _Pharmacie et Mat. Méd. des Chinois_, 1865. 70.\r\n\r\nThe tænicide power is due, according to Tanret (1878) to\r\n_Pelletierine_, C₈H₁₅NO, a liquid dextrogyre alkaloid, boiling at 180°\r\nto 185° C. It can be obtained colourless by evaporating its ethereal\r\nsolution in a vacuum, but in the open air becomes yellow. Pelletierine,\r\nso called in honour of Pelletier, is readily soluble in water, alcohol\r\nor chloroform, and has a somewhat aromatic odour. Several of its\r\nsalts are crystallizable, yet extremely hygroscopic. The yield of the\r\nroot-bark was about ½ per cent. of the alkaloid, or about 2 per cent.\r\nof crystallized sulphate from trees grown near Troyes, in the Champagne.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—A decoction, followed by a purgative, is stated by Waring[1120]\r\nand others to be most efficient for the expulsion of the tapeworm. The\r\n_fresh_ bark is said to be preferable to the dried.\r\n\r\n=Adulterations=—The commercial drug frequently consists partly or\r\nentirely of the bark of the stem or branches, characterized by its less\r\nabundant cork-formation, which exhibits longitudinal bands or ridges\r\nof light brownish cork, but not conchoidal exfoliations. The middle\r\ncortical layer is somewhat more developed, and contains in the outer\r\ncells deposits of chlorophyll. The cambial zone is not distinctly\r\nobservable. Such bark is reputed to be less active than that of the\r\nroot, but we are not aware that the fact has ever been proved.\r\n\r\nThe bark of _Buxus sempervirens_ and of _Berberis vulgaris_ are\r\nsomewhat similar to the drug under notice, but their decoctions are not\r\naffected by salts of iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCURBITACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS ECBALLII.\r\n\r\n_Fructus Elaterii_; _Elaterium Fruit_, _Squirting Cucumber_, _Wild\r\nCucumber_; F. _Concombre purgatif ou sauvage_; G. _Springgurke_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Ecballium[1121] Elaterium_ A. Richard (_Momordica\r\nElaterium_ L.), a coarse, hispid, fleshy, decumbent plant without\r\ntendrils, having a thick white perennial root. It is common throughout\r\nthe Mediterranean region, extending eastward as far as Southern Russia\r\nand Persia, and westward to Portugal. It succeeds well in Central\r\nEurope, and is cultivated to a small extent for medicinal use at\r\nMitcham and Hitchin in England.\r\n\r\n=History=—Theophrastus mentions the plant under notice by the name\r\nof Σίκυος ἄγριος. It is also particularly noticed by Dioscorides,\r\nwho explicitly describes the singular process for making elaterium\r\n(ἐλατήριον), which was almost exactly like that followed at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe Wild or Squirting Cucumber was well known and cultivated in gardens\r\nin England as early as the middle of the 16th century.[1122]\r\n\r\n[1120] _Indian Annals of Med. Science_, vi. (1859); _Pharmacopœia of\r\nIndia_, 1868. 93.\r\n\r\n[1121] _Ecballium_ from ἐκβάλλω, I expel, in allusion to the expulsion\r\nof the seeds: often erroneously written _Ecbalium_.\r\n\r\n[1122] Turner’s _Herball_, 1568, part i. 180.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit is ovoid-oblong, nodding, about 1½ inch long,\r\nhispid from numerous short fleshy prickles terminating in white\r\nelongated points. It is attached by a long scabrous peduncle, is fleshy\r\nand green while young, becoming slightly yellowish when mature; it is\r\n3-celled and contains numerous oblong seeds lodged in a very bitter\r\nsucculent pulp. The fruit when ripe separates suddenly from the stalk,\r\nand at the same moment the seeds and juice are forcibly expelled\r\nfrom the aperture left by the detached peduncle. This interesting\r\nphenomenon[1123] is due to the process of exosmosis, by which the juice\r\nof the outer part of the fruit gradually passes through the strong\r\ncontractile tissue which lines the central cavity, until the pressure\r\nbecomes so great that the cell gives way at its weakest point. This\r\npoint is that at which the peduncle is articulated with the fruit; and\r\nit is the sudden and powerful contraction of the elastic tissue when\r\nrelieved from pressure that occasions the violent expulsion of the\r\ncontents of the central cavity.\r\n\r\nFor the preparation of the officinal elaterium, the fruit has to be\r\nemployed while still somewhat immature, for the simple reason that it\r\nwould be impossible to gather it so as to retain its all-important\r\njuice if left till quite ripe. When it is sliced longitudinally as\r\nin making elaterium, some of the juice is expelled by virtue of the\r\nendosmotic action already described, as can easily be seen on examining\r\nthe contracted lining of the sliced fruit.\r\n\r\nPereira observes[1124] that if the juice of a fruit is received on a\r\nplate of glass, it is seen to be nearly colourless and transparent.\r\nIn a few minutes however, by exposure to the air, it becomes slightly\r\nturbid, and small white coagula are formed in it. By slow evaporation,\r\nminute rhomboidal crystals make their appearance: these are _elaterin_.\r\n\r\nHot, dry weather favours the development of the active principle of the\r\ndrug.[1125]\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The middle layer of the fruit is built up of\r\nlarge somewhat thick-walled cells, traversed by a few fibro-vascular\r\nbundles. The former abound in small starch grains, and also contain\r\ngranules of albuminous matter.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The experiments of Clutterbuck (1819) proved\r\nthat the active properties of the elaterium plant reside chiefly,\r\nthough not exclusively, in the juice that surrounds the seeds; and it\r\nis to this juice and to the medicinal product which it yields, that the\r\nattention of chemists has been hitherto directed.\r\n\r\nThe juice obtained by lightly pressing the sliced fruits is at first\r\ngreenish and slightly turbid. After having been set aside a few hours,\r\nit yields a deposit, which has to be collected on calico, rapidly\r\ndrained with gentle pressure between layers of bibulous paper and\r\nporous bricks, and dried in a warm place. The substance thus obtained\r\nis the _Elaterium_ of pharmacy.[1126] The method recommended by\r\nClutterbuck[1127] involves no pressing. The juice of the sliced fruit\r\nis saved, and the pulp, scooped out by the thumb of the operator, is\r\nthrown on a sieve and slightly washed with pure water. From these\r\nliquors, elaterium is deposited.\r\n\r\n[1123] I have not yet seen Yule’s paper on the dehiscence of this fruit\r\nin the _Journ. of Anat. and Physiology_, 1877. The structure of the\r\ntesta of the seed is explained by Fickel, in the _Botanische Zeitung_,\r\n1876. 774.—F. A. F..\r\n\r\n[1124] _Elem. of Mat. Med._ ii. (1853) 1745.\r\n\r\n[1125] Having had to procure elaterium fruits at Mitcham in the very\r\nfine summer of 1868, I was told that the people occupied in slicing\r\nthe fruits had never suffered so severely from their work as in that\r\nyear.—D. H.\r\n\r\n[1126] There is a genus of _Cucurbitaceæ_ founded by Linnæus, also\r\ncalled _Elaterium_.\r\n\r\n[1127] _Lond. Med. Repository_, xii. (1820) 1.\r\n\r\nElaterium occurs in irregular cake-like fragments, light, friable, and\r\nopaque; when new, of a bright pale green, becoming by age greyish and\r\nexhibiting minute crystals on the surface. It has a herby tea-like\r\nodour and a very bitter taste. The produce is extremely small: 240 lb.\r\nof fruit gathered at Mitcham, 1Oth August 1868, yielded 4⅝ ounces of\r\nelaterium = 0·123 per cent.\r\n\r\nElaterium consists, according to Pereira, of _Elaterin_, to which the\r\nactivity of the drug is due, contaminated with green colouring matter,\r\ncellular tissue, and starch, together with a little of the residue of\r\nthe bitter liquor from which these substances were deposited. Yet, in\r\nour opinion, this description is not applicable to the best varieties\r\nof elaterium. We have examined elaterium carefully prepared in the\r\nlaboratory of Messrs. Allen and Hanburys, London, and a fine specimen\r\nimported from Malta. Both are devoid of starch, as well as of cellular\r\ntissue, but were seen to be largely made up of crystals. The first\r\nsample contained 12 per cent. of water, and yielded after drying, 8·4\r\nper cent. of ash.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting principle of elaterium is _Elaterin_, C₂₀H₂₈O₅,\r\ndiscovered about the year 1831 by Morries, and independently by\r\nHennell. The best method of obtaining it, according to our experience,\r\nis to exhaust elaterium with chloroform. From this solution, a white\r\ncrystalline deposit of elaterin is immediately separated by addition\r\nof ether. It should be washed with a little ether, and recrystallized\r\nfrom chloroform. We have thus obtained 33·6 per cent. of pure elaterin\r\nfrom the above-mentioned elaterium of London, and 27·6 per cent. from\r\nthat of Malta. Elaterin crystallizes in hexagonal scales or prisms; it\r\nhas an extremely bitter, somewhat acrid taste. It is readily soluble in\r\nboiling alcohol, amylic alcohol, bisulphide of carbon, or chloroform.\r\nIts alcoholic solutions are neutral and are not precipitated by tannin,\r\nnor by any metallic solution. It is but very little coloured by cold\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nElaterin is the drastic principle of _Ecballium_; if to its boiling\r\nalcoholic solution, solid caustic potash is added, the liquid thus\r\nobtained is stated by Buchheim (1872) to be no longer precipitable by\r\nwater. The elaterin is then in fact converted into an acid body, which\r\nmay be separated by supersaturating the solution with a mineral acid.\r\nThe principle thus obtained has been found by Buchheim to be devoid of\r\ndrastic power.\r\n\r\nThe fresh juice of the fruits was found by Köhler (1869) to contain\r\n95 per cent. of water, 3 to 3·5 of organic and 1 to 1·6 of inorganic\r\nconstituents. The same chemist observed that the percentage of elaterin\r\ngradually diminished as the season advanced, until in the month of\r\nSeptember he was unable to obtain any of it whatever.\r\n\r\nWalz (1859) found in the juice of the fruits and herb of _Ecballium_,\r\nas well as in that of _Cucumis Prophetarum_ L., a second crystallizable\r\nbitter principle, _Prophetin_, and the amorphous substances _Ecballin_\r\nor _Elateric Acid_, _Hydro-elaterin_, and _Elateride_, all of which\r\nrequire further examination.[1128] Prophetin is a glucoside,—not so\r\nthe other principles. The four together constitute, according to Walz,\r\n8·7 per cent. of elaterium, which moreover contains about the same\r\npercentage of pectic matter.\r\n\r\n[1128] Gmelin’s _Chemistry_, xvii. (1866) 335-367.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Squirting cucumbers are only employed for making elaterium,\r\nwhich is a very powerful hydragogue cathartic.[1129] Elaterin is not\r\nemployed in medicine, but seeing how much elaterium is liable to vary\r\nfrom climate or season, it might probably be introduced into use with\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS COLOCYNTHIDIS.\r\n\r\n_Colocynth_, _Coloquintida_, _Bitter Apple_; F. _Coloquinte_; G.\r\n_Coloquinthe_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Citrullus Colocynthis_ Schrader (_Cucumis\r\nColocynthis_ L.)—The colocynth gourd is a slender scabrous plant with a\r\nperennial root, native of warm and dry regions in the Old World, over\r\nwhich it has an extensive area.\r\n\r\nCommencing eastward, it occurs in abundance in the arid districts\r\nof the Punjab and Sind, in sandy places on the Coromandel coast, in\r\nCeylon, Persia as far north as the Caspian, in Arabia (Aden), Syria,\r\nand in some of the Greek islands. It is found in immense quantities\r\nin Upper Egypt and Nubia, spreading itself over sand hillocks of the\r\ndesert after each rainy season. It further extends throughout North\r\nAfrica to Morocco and Senegambia, in the Cape de Verd Islands, and on\r\nmaritime sands in the south-east of Spain and Portugal. Finally, it is\r\nsaid to have been collected in Japan.\r\n\r\n=History=—Colocynth was familiar to the Greek and Roman, as well as\r\nto the Arabian physicians; it also occurs in Susruta (“Indravārunī”);\r\nand if we may judge by the mention of it in an Anglo-Saxon herbal of\r\nthe 11th century,[1130] was not then unknown in Britain. The drug was\r\ncollected in Spain at an early period, as is evident from an Arabic\r\ncalendar of A.D. 961.[1131]\r\n\r\nThe plant has been long cultivated in Cyprus, and its fruit is\r\nmentioned in the 14th century as one of the more important products of\r\nthe island.[1132] Tragus (1552) figured the plant, and stated that the\r\nfruit is imported from Alexandria.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The colocynth plant bears a gourd of the size and shape\r\nof an orange, having a smooth, marbled-green surface. It is sometimes\r\nimported simply dried, in which case it is of a brown colour; but\r\nfar more usually it is found in the market peeled with a knife and\r\ndried. It then forms light, pithy, nearly white balls, which consist\r\nof the dried internal pulp of the fruit with the seeds imbedded in\r\nit. This pulp is nearly inodorous, but has an intensely bitter taste,\r\nperceptible by reason of its dust when the drug is slightly handled.\r\nThe balls are generally more or less broken; when dried too slowly they\r\nhave a light brown colour.\r\n\r\n[1129] Clutterbuck says ⅛ of a grain purges violently.\r\n\r\n[1130] Cockayne, _Leechdoms_, etc., i.

(1852-61) 498.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are disposed in vertical rows on 3 thick parietal placentæ,\r\nwhich project to the centre of the fruit, then divide and turn back,\r\nforming two branches directed towards one another. Owing to this\r\nstructure, the fruit easily breaks up vertically into 3 wedges in each\r\nof which are lodged 2 rows of dark brown seeds. The seeds, of which a\r\nfruit contains from 200 to 300, are of flattened ovoid form, ³/₁₀ of\r\nan inch long by ²/₁₀ broad, not bordered. The testa which is hard and\r\nthick, having its surface minutely granulated, is marked on each side\r\nof its more pointed end by two furrows directed towards the hilum. The\r\nseed, as in other _Cucurbitaceæ_, is exalbuminous, and has thick oily\r\ncotyledons, enclosing an embryo with short straight radicle directed\r\ntowards the hilum.\r\n\r\nColocynth fruits are mostly supplied by wholesale druggists, broken\r\nup and having the seeds removed, the drug in such case being called\r\n_Colocynth Pulp_ or _Pith_.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The pulp is made up of large thin-walled\r\nparenchymatous cells, their outer layer consisting of rows of smaller\r\ncells more densely packed. The tissue is irregularly traversed by\r\nfibro-vascular bundles, and also exhibits numerous large intercellular\r\nspaces. The cells contain but an insignificant amount of minute\r\ngranules, to which neither iodine nor a persalt of iron imparts any\r\ncoloration. The tissue is not much swollen by water, although one part\r\nof the pulp easily retains from 10 to 12 parts of water like a sponge.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The bitter principle has been isolated in 1847\r\nby Hübschmann.[1133] He observed that alcohol removes from the fruit a\r\nlarge amount of _resin_. By submitting this solution to distillation,\r\nthe bitter principle remains partly in the aqueous liquid, partly\r\nin the resin, from which the “_Colocynthin_” is to be extracted by\r\nboiling water. The whole solution was then concentrated and mixed\r\nwith carbonate of potassium, when a thickish viscid liquid separated.\r\nHübschmann dried it and redissolved it in a mixture of 1 part of strong\r\nalcohol and 8 parts of ether. After treatment with charcoal, the\r\nsolvents were distilled and the remaining bitter principle removed by\r\nmeans of water. This on evaporating afforded 2 per cent. of the pulp of\r\na yellow extremely bitter powder, readily soluble in water or alcohol,\r\nnot in pure ether. Colocynthin is precipitated from its aqueous\r\nsolution by carbonate of potassium. Colocynthin was further extracted\r\nby Lebourdais (1848) by evaporating the aqueous infusion of the fruit\r\nwith charcoal, and exhausting the dried powder with boiling alcohol.\r\n\r\n[1133] _Schweizerische Zeitschrift für Pharmacie_, 1858. 216.\r\n\r\nAgain, another method was followed by Walz (1858). He treated alcoholic\r\nextract of colocynth with water, and mixed the solution firstly with\r\nneutral acetate of lead, and subsequently with basic acetate of\r\nlead. From the filtered liquid the lead was separated by means of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, and then tannic acid added to it. The latter\r\ncaused the colocynthin to be precipitated; the precipitate washed and\r\ndried was decomposed by oxide of lead, and finally the colocynthin was\r\ndissolved out by ether.\r\n\r\nWalz thus obtained about ¼ per cent. of a yellowish mass or tufts,\r\nwhich he considered as possessing crystalline structure and to which he\r\ngave the name _Colocynthin_. He assigns to it the formula C₅₆H₈₄O₂₃,\r\nwhich in our opinion requires further investigation. Colocynthin is\r\na violent purgative; it is decomposed according to Walz by boiling\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid, and then yields _Colocyntheïn_, C₄₄H₆₄O₁₃,\r\nand grape sugar. The same chemist termed _Colocynthitin_ that part of\r\nthe alcoholic extract of colocynth which is soluble in ether but not in\r\nwater. Purified with boiling alcohol, colocynthitin forms a tasteless\r\ncrystalline powder.\r\n\r\nThe pulp perfectly freed from seeds and dried at 100° C., afforded us\r\n11 per cent. of ash; the seeds alone yield only 2·7 per cent. They\r\nhave, even when crushed, but a faint bitter taste, and contain 17 per\r\ncent. of fat oil.\r\n\r\nThe fresh leaves of the plant if rubbed emit a very unpleasant smell.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The drug is imported from Mogador, Spain and Syria.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—In the form of an extract made with weak alcohol, and combined\r\nwith aloes and scammony, colocynth is much employed as a purgative. The\r\nseeds, roasted or boiled, are the miserable food of some of the poorest\r\ntribes of the Sahara.[1134]\r\n\r\nThe people of the Berber upon the Nile make a curious application\r\nfor the tar they obtain from the fruit. The latter is heated in an\r\nearthen vessel with a hole in it; the tar drips through to another\r\nvessel and is fit for smearing leather water-bags. The bad smell of\r\nthe tar (and of the leaves) prevents the camels from cutting open the\r\nwater-bags.[1135]\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—_Cucumis trigonus_ Roxb. (_C. Pseudo-colocynthis_ Royle),\r\na plant of the plains of Northern India, with spherical or elongated,\r\nsometimes obscurely trigonous, bitter fruits, prostate _rooting_ stems,\r\nand deeply divided leaves, resembles the colocynth gourd and has been\r\nmistaken for it. Another species named by Royle _C. Hardwickii_, and\r\nknown to the natives of India as _Hill Colocynth_, has oval oblong\r\nbitter fruits, but leaves entirely unlike those of the _Citrullus\r\nColocynthis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUMBELLIFERÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBA HYDROCOTYLES.\r\n\r\n_Indian Hydrocotyle_, _Indian Pennywort_; F. _Bevilacqua_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Hydrocotyle asiatica_ L., a small creeping\r\nherb,[1136] with slender jointed stems, common in moist places\r\nthroughout tropical Asia and Africa, ascending in Abyssinia to\r\nelevations of 6,000 feet. It also occurs in America from South Carolina\r\nto Valdivia, in the West Indies, the islands of the Pacific, New\r\nZealand, and Australia.\r\n\r\n=History=—Hydrocotyle is called in Sanskrit _mandūka-parnī_, in Hindi\r\n_khulakhudi_. The former name denotes various plants, but is thought\r\nto refer in Susruta to the plant under notice (Dr. Rice). It was known\r\nto Rheede[1137] by its Malyalim name of _Codagam_ (or _Kutakan_),\r\nand also to Rumphius.[1138] It has been long used medicinally by the\r\nnatives of Java and of the Coromandel coast. In 1852, Boileau, a French\r\nphysician of Mauritius, pointed out its virtues in the treatment of\r\nleprosy,[1139] for which disease it was largely tried in the hospitals\r\nof Madras by Hunter[1140] in 1855. It has since been admitted to a\r\nplace in the _Pharmacopœia of India_.\r\n\r\n[1134] See my paper on _Cucumis Colocynthis_ considered as a nutritive\r\nplant in the _Archiv der Pharmacie_, 201 (1872) 235.—F.

The leaves\r\nare reniform, crenate, ½ to 2 inches in longest diameter, 7-nerved,\r\nglabrous, or when young somewhat hairy on the under side. The fruit\r\nis laterally compressed, orbicular, acute on the back; the mericarps\r\nreticulated, sometimes a little hairy, with 3 to 5 curved ribs; they\r\nare devoid of vittæ. The main root is an inch or two long, but roots\r\nare also thrown out by the procumbent stem.\r\n\r\nWhen fresh, the herb is said to be aromatic and of a disagreeable\r\nbitter and pungent taste; but these qualities appear to be lost in\r\ndrying.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—An analysis of hydrocotyle has been made by\r\nLépine, a pharmacien of Pondicherry,[1142] who found it to yield a\r\nsomewhat peculiar body which he called _Vellarin_, from _Valālrai_,\r\nthe Tamil name of the plant, and regarded as its active principle.\r\nVellarin, which is said to be obtainable from the dry plant to the\r\nextent of 0·8 to 1·0 per cent., is an oily, non-volatile liquid with\r\nthe smell and taste of fresh hydrocotyle, soluble in spirit of wine,\r\nether, caustic ammonia, and partially also in hydrochloric acid.\r\nThese singular properties do not enable us to rank vellarin in any\r\nwell-characterized class of organic compounds.\r\n\r\nBy exhausting 3 ounces of the dried herb with rectified spirit, we did\r\nnot obtain any thing like vellarin, but simply a green extract almost\r\nentirely soluble in warm water, and containing chiefly tannic acid,\r\nwhich produced an abundant green precipitate with salts of iron. With\r\ncaustic potash, neither the herb nor its extract evolved any nauseous\r\nodour. The dried plant afforded Lépine 13 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—As an alterative tonic, hydrocotyle is allowed to be of some\r\nutility, but the power claimed for it by Boileau of curing leprosy is\r\ngenerally denied. Dorvault[1143] regards it as belonging to the class\r\nof narcotico-acrid poisons such as hemlock, but we see no evidence to\r\nwarrant such an opinion. Besides being administered internally, it is\r\nsometimes locally applied in the form of a poultice. Boileau says that\r\nthe entire plant is preferable to the leaves alone.[1144]\r\n\r\n=Substitutes (?)=—_H. rotundifolia_ Roxb., another species common in\r\nIndia, may be known from _H. asiatica_ by having 10 or more flowers\r\nin an umbel and much smaller fruits. The European _H. vulgaris_ L.,\r\neasily distinguishable from the allied tropical species just described,\r\nby having its leaves orbicular and peltate (not reniform), is said to\r\npossess deleterious properties.\r\n\r\n[1141] Drawn up from Indian specimens.\r\n\r\n[1142] _Journ. de Pharm._ xxviii.

But the plant is very unevenly\r\ndistributed, and in many districts is entirely wanting. It is found in\r\nmost parts of Britain from Kent and Cornwall to the Orkneys.\r\n\r\n=History=—Κώνειον, occurring as early as the fourth or fifth century\r\nB.C. in the Greek literature, was the plant under notice, at least in\r\nmost cases. The famous hemlock potion of the Greeks by which criminals\r\nwere put to death[1145] was essentially composed of the juice of this\r\nplant. The old Roman name of Conium was _Cicuta_; it prevails in the\r\nmediæval Latin literature, but was applied, about 1541, by Gesner\r\n(and probably before him by others) to _Cicuta virosa_ L., another\r\numbelliferous plant which is altogether wanting in Greece and in\r\nSouthern Europe generally, and does not contain any poisonous alkaloid.\r\nTo avoid the confusion arising from the same appellation given to\r\nthese widely different and quite dissimilar plants, Linnæus, in 1737,\r\nrestoring the classical Greek name, called it Conium maculatum.[1146]\r\n\r\nHemlock was used in Anglo-Saxon medicine. It is mentioned as early as\r\nthe 1Oth century in the vocabulary of Alfric, archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nas “_Cicuta_, hemlic,”[1147] and also in the Meddygon Myddfai. Hemlock\r\nis derived from the Anglo-Saxon words “hem,” border, shore, and “leác”\r\nleek. Its use in modern medicine is due chiefly to the recommendation\r\nof Störck of Vienna, since whose time (1760) the plant has been\r\nmuch employed. The extreme uncertainty and even inertness of its\r\npreparations, which had long been known to physicians and had caused\r\nits rejection by many, have been recently investigated by Harley.[1148]\r\nThe careful experiments of this physician show what are the real powers\r\nof the drug, and by what method its active properties may be utilized.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit has the structure usual to the order; it is\r\nbroadly ovoid, somewhat compressed laterally, and constricted towards\r\nthe commissure, attenuated towards the apex, which is crowned with a\r\ndepressed stylopodium. As met with in the shops, it consists of the\r\nseparated mericarps which are about ⅛ of an inch long. The dorsal\r\nsurface of these has 5 prominent longitudinal ridges, the edges of\r\nwhich are marked with little protuberances giving them a jagged or\r\ncrenate outline, which is most conspicuous before the fruits are fully\r\nripe. The furrows are glabrous but slightly wrinkled longitudinally;\r\nthey are devoid of vittæ. When a mericarp is cut transversely, the seed\r\nexhibits a reniform outline, due to a deep furrow in the albumen on the\r\nside of the commissure.\r\n\r\n[1145] See Imbert-Gourbeyre, _De la mort de Socrate par la Ciguë_,\r\nParis, 1876.\r\n\r\n[1146] An extensive paper has been devoted by Albert Regel to the\r\n_History of Conium_ and _Cicuta_ in the _Bulletin de la Soc. imp. des\r\nNaturalistes de Moscou_, tome li.

(1868) 53.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of hemlock are dull greenish grey, and have but little taste\r\nand smell; but when triturated with a solution of caustic alkali they\r\nevolve a strong and offensive odour.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—Hemlock fruits differ from other fruits of\r\nthe order by the absence of vittæ.[1149] In the endocarp, there is a\r\npeculiar layer of small nearly cubic cells surrounding the albumen. The\r\ncells of the endocarp are loaded with a brown liquid consisting chiefly\r\nof conine and essential oil.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most important constituent of the fruits of\r\nhemlock _Conine_ or _Conia_, C₈H₁₄NH, a limpid colourless oily fluid,\r\n0·846 sp. gr. at 12°·5 C. It has a strong alkaline reaction, and boils\r\nat 170° C. in an atmosphere devoid of oxygen, without decomposition. It\r\nwas first observed by Giseke at Eisleben, Saxony, in 1827, recognized\r\nas an alkaloid by Geiger in 1831, and more amply studied by Wertheim\r\nin 1856 and 1862. To obtain it, an alcoholic extract is submitted\r\nto distillation with a little slaked lime. The product should be\r\nneutralized with oxalic acid, and the oxalate of conine removed by\r\nabsolute alcohol mixed with a little ether, oxalate of ammonium being\r\ninsoluble. The oxalate of the alkaloid shaken with caustic lye and\r\nether, affords the conine, on evaporating the solvent and distilling\r\nthe alkaloid in a current of dry hydrogen. In the plant it is combined\r\nwith an acid (malic?), and accompanied by ammonia, as well as by a\r\nsecond, less poisonous crystallizable base, called _Conhydrine_,\r\nC₈H₁₇NO, which may be converted into conine by abstraction of the\r\nelements of water. From these alkaloids a liquid non-poisonous\r\nhydrocarbon, _Conylene_, C₈H₁₄, has been separated by Wertheim. Even in\r\nnature one hydrogen atom of conine is frequently replaced by methyl,\r\nCH₃; and commercial conine commonly contains, as shown by A. von Planta\r\nand Kekulé, methyl-conine, C₈H₁₄NCH₃. Lastly there is present in\r\nhemlock fruits a third alkaloid having probably the composition C₇H₁₃N.\r\n\r\nAs to the yield of conine, it varies according to the development\r\nof the fruits, but it is at best only about ⅕ per cent. According\r\nto Schroff (1870), the fruits are most active just before maturity,\r\nprovided they are gathered from the biennial plant. At a later stage,\r\nconine is probably partly transformed into conhydrine, which however is\r\npresent in but very small proportion,—about 1¼ per mille at most.\r\n\r\nIn its deleterious action, conine resembles nicotine, but is much less\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\nSchiff (1871-1872) has artificially produced an alkaloid partaking of\r\nthe general properties of conine, and having the same composition; but\r\nit is optically indifferent. Conine, on the other hand, we find turns\r\nthe plane of polarization to the right.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of hemlock contain also a volatile oil which appears devoid\r\nof poisonous properties; it exists in but small quantity and has not\r\nyet been fully examined.\r\n\r\n[1149] See _Moynier de Villepoix_, _Annales des Sciences naturelles_,\r\nBotanique, v. (1878) 348.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The fruits of hemlock are the only convenient source of the\r\nalkaloid conine. They were introduced into British medicine in 1864,\r\nas a substitute for the dried leaf in making the tincture. But it has\r\nbeen shown that a tincture, whether of leaf or fruit, is a preparation\r\nof very small value, and that it is far inferior to the preserved juice\r\nof the herb. It has however been pointed out by W. Manlius Smith,[1150]\r\nand his observations have been confirmed by Harley,[1151] that the\r\n_green unripe fruits_ possess more than any other part the peculiar\r\nenergies of the plant, and that they may even be dried without loss of\r\nactivity. A medicinal fluid extract of considerable power has been made\r\nfrom them by Squibb of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLIA CONII.\r\n\r\n_Hemlock Leaves_; F. _Feuilles de Ciguë_; G. _Schierlingsblätter_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Conium maculatum_ L., see p. 299.\r\n\r\n=History=—See p. 299.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Hemlock in its first year produces only a tuft of leaves;\r\nbut in its second a stout erect stem which often grows to the height\r\nof 5 or 9 feet, is much branched in its upper part, and terminates in\r\nsmall umbels, each having about 12 rays. The lower leaves, often a foot\r\nin length, have a triangular outline, and a hollow stalk as long as the\r\nlamina, clasping the stem at its base with a membranous sheath. Towards\r\nthe upper portion of the plant, the leaves have shorter stalks, are\r\nless divided, and are opposite or in cohorts of 3 to 5. The involucral\r\nbracts are lanceolate, reflexed, and about a ¼ of an inch long. Those\r\nof the partial umbel are turned towards the outside, and are always 3\r\nin number. The larger leaves are twice or thrice pinnate, the ultimate\r\nsegments being ovate-oblong, acute, and deeply incised.\r\n\r\nThe stem is cylindrical and hollow, of a glaucous green, generally\r\nmarked on its lower part with reddish-brown spots. The leaves are of a\r\ndull dark green, and like the rest of the plant quite glabrous. They\r\nhave when bruised a disagreeable fœtid smell.\r\n\r\nFor medicinal purposes the plant should be taken when in full\r\nblossom.[1152]\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The leaves of hemlock contain, though in\r\nexceedingly small proportion, the same alkaloids as the fruits. Geiger\r\nobtained from the fresh herb not so much as one ten-thousandth part\r\nof conine. It is probable however that the active constituents vary\r\nin proportion considerably, and that a dry and sunny climate promotes\r\ntheir development.\r\n\r\nThe same observer, as well as Pereira, has pointed out that hemlock\r\nleaves when dried are very frequently almost devoid of conine, and\r\nthe observation is supported by the more recent experiments of Harley\r\n(1867). It has also been shown by the last named physician, that the\r\ninspissated juice known in pharmacy as _Extractum Conii_ usually\r\ncontains but a mere trace of alkaloid, the latter having in fact been\r\ndissipated by the heat employed in reducing the juice to the required\r\nconsistence. On the other hand, Harley has proved that the juice of\r\nfresh hemlock preserved by the addition of spirit of wine, as in the\r\n_Succus Conii_ of the Pharmacopœia, possesses in an eminent degree the\r\npoisonous properties of the plant.\r\n\r\n[1150] _Trans. of the New York State Medical Society_ for 1867.\r\n\r\n[1151] _The old Vegetable Neurotics_, Lond. 1869.\r\n\r\n[1152] The London herbalists often collect it while much of the\r\ninflorescence is still in bud, in which state it affords far more of\r\nleaf than when well matured; but it is in the latter condition that the\r\nplant is to be preferred.\r\n\r\nThe entire amount of nitrogen in dried hemlock leaves was estimated by\r\nWrightson (1845) at 6·8 per cent.; the ash at 12·8 per cent. The latter\r\nconsists mainly of salts of potassium, sodium, and calcium, especially\r\nof sodium chloride and calcium phosphate.\r\n\r\nA ferment-oil may be obtained from _Conium_; it is stated to have an\r\nodour unlike that of the plant and a burning taste, and not to be\r\npoisonous.[1153]\r\n\r\n[1153] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, xiv. 405.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Hemlock administered in the form of _Succus Conii_, has a\r\npeculiar sedative action on the motor nerves, on account of which it\r\nis occasionally prescribed. It was formerly much more employed than at\r\npresent, although the preparations used were so defective that they\r\ncould rarely have produced the specific action of the medicine.\r\n\r\n=Plants liable to be confounded with Hemlock=—Several common plants of\r\nthe order _Umbelliferæ_ have a superficial resemblance to _Conium_, but\r\ncan be discriminated by characters easy of observation. One of these is\r\n_Æthusa Cynapium_ L. or _Fool’s Parsley_, a common annual garden weed,\r\nof much smaller stature than hemlock. It may be known by its primary\r\numbel having no involucre, and by its partial umbel having an involucel\r\nof 2 or 3 linear pendulous bracts. The ridges of its fruit moreover are\r\nnot wavy or crenate as in hemlock, nor is its stem spotted.\r\n\r\n_Chærophyllum Anthriscus_ L. (_Anthriscus vulgaris_ Pers.) and two\r\nor three other species of _Chærophyllum_ have the lower leaves not\r\nunlike those of hemlock, but they are _pubescent_ or _ciliated_. The\r\nfruits too are _linear-oblong_, and thus very dissimilar from those of\r\n_Conium_.\r\n\r\nThe latter plant is in fact clearly distinguished by its smooth spotted\r\nstem, the character of its involucral bracts and fruit, and finally by\r\nthe circumstance that when triturated with a few drops of solution of\r\ncaustic alkali, it evolves conine (and ammonia), easily observable as\r\na white fume when a rod moistened with strong acetic acid is held over\r\nthe mortar.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS AJOWAN.\r\n\r\n_Semen Ajavæ vel Ajouain_; _Ajowan_, _True Bishop’s weed_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Carum Ajowan_ Bentham et Hooker (_Ammi copticum_\r\nL. _Ptychotis coptica_ et _Pt. Ajowan_ DC.)—an erect annual herb,\r\ncultivated in Egypt and Persia, and especially in India where it is\r\nwell known as _Ajvan_ or _Omam_.\r\n\r\n=History=—The minute spicy fruits of the above-named plant have been\r\nused in India from a remote period, as we may infer from their being\r\nmentioned in Sanskrit writings, as, for instance, by the grammarian\r\nPānini, in the third century B.C. (or later?), and in Susruta.\r\n\r\nOwing to their having been confounded with some other very small\r\numbelliferous fruits, it is difficult to trace them precisely in many\r\nof the older writers on materia medica. It is however probable that\r\nthey are the _Ammi_ which Anguillara[1154] met with in 1549 at Venice,\r\nwhere it had then, exceptionally, been imported in small quantity from\r\nAlexandria. It is also, we suppose, the _Ammi perpusillum_ of Lobel\r\n(1571), in whose time the drug was likewise imported from Egypt, as\r\nwell as the _Ammi alterum parvum_, the seed of which Dodonæus (1583)\r\nmentions as being “minutissimum, acre et fervidum.” Dale,[1155] who\r\nsays it is brought from Alexandria, reports it as very scarce in the\r\nLondon shops. Under the name of _Ajave Seeds_, the drug was again\r\nbrought into notice in 1773 by Percival,[1156] who received a small\r\nquantity of it from Malabar as a remedy for colic; and still more\r\nrecently, it has been favourably spoken of by Fleming, Ainslie,\r\nRoxburgh, O’Shaughnessy, Waring and other writers who have treated of\r\nIndian materia medica.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Ajowan fruits, like those of other cultivated\r\n_Umbelliferæ_, vary somewhat in size and form. The largest kind much\r\nresemble those of parsley, being of about the same shape and weight.\r\nThe length of the large fruits is about ⅒, of the smaller form scarcely\r\n¹/₁₆ of an inch. The fruits are greyish brown, plump, very rough on the\r\nsurface, owing to numerous minute tubercles (_fructus muriculatus_).\r\nEach mericarp has five prominent ridges, the intervening channels being\r\ndark brown, with a single vitta in each. The commissural side bears two\r\nvittæ. The fruits when rubbed exhale a strong odour of thyme (_Thymus\r\nvulgaris_ L.), and have a biting aromatic taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The oil-ducts of ajowan are very large, often\r\nattaining a diameter of 200 mkm. The ridges contain numerous spiral\r\nvessels; the blunt tubercles of the epidermis are of the same structure\r\nas those in anise, but comparatively larger and not pointed. The tissue\r\nof the albumen exhibits numerous crystalloid granules of albuminous\r\nmatter (aleuron), distinctly observable in polarized light.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The fruits on an average afford from 4 to\r\n4·5 per cent. of an agreeable aromatic, volatile oil; at the same\r\ntime there often collects on the surface of the distilled water a\r\ncrystalline substance, which is prepared at Oojein and elsewhere in\r\nCentral India, by exposing the oil to spontaneous evaporation at a low\r\ntemperature. This stearoptene, sold in the shops of Poona and other\r\nplaces of the Deccan, under the name of _Ajwain-ka-phul_, i.e. _flowers\r\nof ajwain_, was showed by Stenhouse (1855) and by Haines (1856) to be\r\nidentical with\r\n\r\n                 {OH\r\n    Thymol, C₆H₃ {CH₃, as contained in Thymus vulgaris.\r\n                 {C₃H₇\r\n\r\nWe obtained it by exposing oil of our own distillation, first rectified\r\nfrom chloride of calcium, to a temperature of 0° C., when the oil\r\ndeposited 36 per cent. of thymol in superb tabular crystals, an inch\r\nor more in length. The liquid portion, even after long exposure to a\r\ncold some degrees below the freezing point, yielded no further crop.\r\nWe found the thymol thus obtained began to melt at 44° C., yet using\r\nsomewhat larger quantities, it appeared to require fully 51° C. for\r\ncomplete fusion. On cooling, it continues fluid for a long time, and\r\nonly recrystallizes when a crystal of thymol is projected into it.\r\n\r\n[1154] _Semplici_, Vinegia, 1561. 130.\r\n\r\n[1155] _Pharmacologia_, 1693. 211.\r\n\r\n[1156] _Essays, Medical and Experimental_, ii. (1773) 226.\r\n\r\nThymol is more conveniently and completely extracted from the oil by\r\nshaking it repeatedly with caustic lye, and neutralizing the latter.\r\n\r\nThe oil of ajowan, from which the thymol has been removed, boils\r\nat about 172°, and contains cymene (or cymol), C₁₀H₁₄, which, with\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid, affords cymen-sulphonic acid, C₁₀H₁₃SO₂OH.\r\nThe latter is not very readily crystallizable, but forms crystallized\r\nsalts with baryum, calcium, zinc, lead, which are abundantly soluble\r\nin water. In the oil of ajowan no constituent of the formula C₁₀H₁₆\r\nappears to be present; mixed with alcohol and nitric acid (see p. 279)\r\nit at least produces no crystals of terpin.\r\n\r\nThe residual portions of the oil, from which the cymene has been\r\ndistilled, contains another substance of the phenol class different\r\nfrom thymol.\r\n\r\nWe have found that neither the thymol nor the liquid part of ajowan oil\r\npossesses any rotatory power.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Ajowan is much used by the natives of India as a\r\ncondiment.[1157] The distilled water which has been introduced into\r\nthe _Pharmacopœia of India_, is reputed to be carminative, and a good\r\nvehicle for nauseous medicines. It has a powerful burning taste, and\r\nwould seem to require dilution. The volatile oil may be used in the\r\nplace of oil of thyme, which it closely resembles.\r\n\r\nAjowan seeds are largely imported into Europe since thymol has been\r\nuniversally introduced into medical practice (see Folia Thymi). They\r\nhave proved much more remunerative for the manufacture of thymol than\r\nThymus vulgaris. The largest quantities, we believe, of thymol have\r\nbeen made from ajowan at Leipzig.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—Under the name _Semen Ammi_, the very small fruits of\r\n_Ammi majus_ L. and of _Sison Amomum_ L. have been often confounded\r\nwith those of Ajowan; but the _absence of hairs_ on the two former,\r\nnot to mention some other differences, is sufficient to negative any\r\nsupposition of identity.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of _Hyoscyamus niger_ L. being called in India\r\n_Khorāsāniajwān_, a confusion might arise between them and true\r\najowan; though the slightest examination would suffice to show the\r\ndifference.[1158]\r\n\r\n[1157] Roxburgh, _Flor. Ind._ ii. (1832) 91.\r\n\r\n[1158] To such a mistake may probably be referred the statement of\r\nIrvine (_Account of the Mat. Med. of Patna_, 1848, p. 6) that the seeds\r\nof henbane are “used in food as carminative and stimulant”!\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS CARUI.\r\n\r\n_Semen Carui vel Carvi_; _Caraway Fruits_, _Caraway Seeds_, _Caraways_;\r\nF. _Fruits ou Semences de Carvi_; G. _Kümmel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Carum Carvi_ L., an erect annual or biennial plant\r\nnot unlike a carrot, growing in meadows and moist grassy land over the\r\nnorthern and midland parts of Europe and Asia, but to what extent truly\r\nwild cannot be always ascertained.\r\n\r\nIt is much cultivated in Iceland, and is also apparently wild.[1159]\r\nIt grows throughout Scandinavia, in Finland, Arctic, Central, and\r\nSouthern Russia, Persia, and in Siberia. It appears as a wild plant\r\nin many parts of Britain (Lincolnshire and Yorkshire), but is also\r\ncultivated in fields, and may not be strictly indigenous. The caraway\r\nis found throughout the eastern part of France, in the Pyrenees,\r\nSpain, Central Europe, Armenia, and the Caucasian provinces; and it\r\ngrows wild largely in the high alpine region of Lahul, in the Western\r\nHimalaya.[1160]\r\n\r\n[1159] Babington in _Journ. of Linn. Soc._, Bot. xi. (1871) 310.\r\n\r\n[1160] Aitchison in _Journ. of Linn. Soc._, Bot., x. (1869) 76. 94.\r\n\r\nBut the most curious fact in the distribution of _Carum Carvi_ is its\r\noccurrence in Morocco, where it is largely cultivated about El Araiche,\r\nand round the city of Morocco.[1161] The plant differs somewhat from\r\nthat of Europe; it is an annual with a single erect stem, 4 feet high.\r\nIts foliage is more divided, and its flowers larger, with shorter\r\nstyles and on more spreading umbels than the common caraway, and its\r\nfruit is more elongated.[1162]\r\n\r\n=History=—The opinion that this plant is the Κάρος of Dioscorides,\r\nand that, as Pliny states, it derived its name from Caria (where it\r\nhas never been met with in modern times) has very reasonably been\r\ndoubted.[1163]\r\n\r\nCaraway fruits were known to the Arabians, who called them _Karawya_,\r\na name they still bear in the East, and the original of our words\r\n_caraway_ and _carui_, as well as of the Spanish _alcarahueya_. In the\r\ndescription of Morocco by Edrisi,[1164] 12th century, it is stated that\r\nthe inhabitants of Sidjilmâsa (the south-eastern province) cultivate\r\ncotton, _cumin_, _caraway_, henna (_Lawsonia alba_ Lamarck). In the\r\nArab writings quoted by Ibn Baytar,[1165] himself a Mauro-Spaniard of\r\nthe 13th century, caraway is compared to cumin and anise. The spice\r\nprobably came into use about this period. It is not noticed by St.\r\nIsidore, archbishop of Seville in the 7th century, though he mentions\r\nfennel, dill, coriander, anise, and parsley; nor is it named by St.\r\nHildegard in Germany in the 12th century. Neither have we found any\r\nreference to it in the Anglo-Saxon _Herbarium of Apuleius_, written\r\n_circa_ A.D. 1050,[1166] or in other works of the same period, though\r\ncumin, anise, fennel, and dill are all mentioned.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in two German medicine-books of the 12th and 13th\r\ncenturies[1167] there occurs the word _Cumich_, which is still the\r\npopular name of caraway, in Southern Germany; and _Cumin_ is also\r\nmentioned. In the same period the seeds appear to have been used by\r\nthe Welsh physicians of Myddvai.[1168] Caraway was certainly in use in\r\nEngland at the close of the 14th century, as it figures with coriander,\r\npepper and garlick in the _Form of Cury_, a roll of ancient English\r\ncookery compiled by the master-cooks of Richard II. about A.D. 1390.\r\n\r\n[1161] Leared in _Pharm.

And though it is now sold\r\nin the Indian bazaars, its name does not occur in the earlier lists of\r\nIndian spices.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation=[1169]—In England, the caraway is cultivated exclusively\r\nin Kent and Essex, on clay lands. It was formerly sown mixed with\r\ncoriander and teazel seed, but now with the former only. The plant,\r\nwhich requires the most diligent and careful cultivation, yields in its\r\nsecond year a crop which is ready for harvesting in the beginning of\r\nJuly. It is cut with a hook at about a foot from the ground, and a few\r\ndays afterwards may be thrashed. The produce is very variable, but may\r\nbe stated at 4 to 8 cwt. per acre.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruits, which in structure correspond to those of\r\nother plants of the order, are laterally compressed and ovate. The\r\nmericarps which hang loosely suspended from the arms of the carpophore,\r\nare in the English drug about ⅙ of an inch in length and ¹/₂₀ in\r\ndiameter, subcylindrical, slightly arched, and tipped with the conical,\r\nshrivelled stylopodium. They are marked with five pale ridges, nearly\r\nhalf as broad as the shining, dark brown furrows, each of which is\r\nfurnished with a conspicuous vitta; a pair of vittæ separated from each\r\nother by a comparatively thin fibro-vascular bundle, occurs on the\r\ncommissure.\r\n\r\nCaraways are somewhat horny and translucent; when bruised, they evolve\r\nan agreeable fragrance resembling that of dill, and they have a\r\npleasant spicy taste. In the London market, they are distinguished as\r\n_English_, _Dutch_, _German_, and _Mogador_, the first sort fetching\r\nthe highest price. The fruit varies in size, tint and flavour; the\r\nEnglish is shorter and plumper than the others; the Mogador is paler,\r\nstalky, and elongated—often ³/₁₀ of an inch in length.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—Caraways are especially distinguished by their\r\nenormous vittæ, which in transverse section display a triangular\r\noutline, the largest diameter, _i.e._ the base of the triangle, often\r\nattaining as much as 300 mkm. Even those of the commissure are usually\r\nnot smaller.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Caraways contain a volatile oil, which the Dutch\r\ndrug affords to the extent of 5·5 per cent., that grown in Germany to\r\nthe amount of 7 per cent.[1170]; in Norway 5·8 per cent. have also been\r\nobtained from indigenous caraways.[1171] The position and size of the\r\nvittæ account for the fact that comminution of the fruits previous to\r\ndistillation, does not increase the yield of oil.\r\n\r\nVölckel (1840) showed that the oil is a mixture of a hydrocarbon\r\nC₁₀H₁₆, and an oxygenated oil, C₁₀H₁₄O. Berzelius subsequently termed\r\nthe former _Carvene_ and the latter _Carvol_.\r\n\r\nCarvene, constituting about one-third of the crude oil, boils at 173°\r\nC., and forms with dry hydrochloric gas crystals of C₁₀H₁₆ + 2HCl.\r\nIt has been ascertained by us that carvene, as well as carvol, has a\r\ndextrogyrate power, that of carvene being considerably the stronger;\r\nthere are probably not many liquids exhibiting a stronger dextrogyrate\r\nrotation. Carvene is of a weaker odour than carvol, from which it has\r\nnot yet been absolutely deprived; perfectly pure carvene would no\r\ndoubt prove no longer to possess the specific odour of the drug. By\r\ndistilling it over sodium it acquires a rather pleasant odour; its\r\nspec. gr. at 15° C. is equal to 0·861.\r\n\r\n[1169] Morton, _Cyclop. of Agriculture_, i. (1855) 390.\r\n\r\n[1170] Information obligingly supplied by Messrs. Schimmel & Co.,\r\nLeipzig.\r\n\r\n[1171] Schübeler, _Pflanzenwelt Norwegens_. Christiania, 1863-1875. 85.\r\n\r\nCarvol at 20° C. has a sp. gr. of 0·953; it boils at 224° C.; the same\r\noil appears to occur in dill (see Fructus Anethi), and an oil of the\r\nsame percental constitution is yielded by the spearmint. The latter\r\nhowever deviates the plane of polarization to the left. If 4 parts of\r\ncarvol, either from caraways, dill, or spearmint, are mixed with 1 part\r\nof alcohol, sp. gr. 0·830, and saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen,\r\ncrystals of (C₁₀H₁₄C)₂SH₂ are at once formed as soon as a little\r\nammonia is added.[1172]\r\n\r\nOil of caraway of inferior quality is obtained from the refuse of the\r\nfruit; we find it less dextrogyrate than the oil from the fruits alone;\r\nthis is due to the admixture of oil of turpentine before distilling.\r\n\r\nIf the carvol is distilled there remains in the still a thickish\r\nresidue, from which a substance of the phenol class may be extracted by\r\ncaustic lye.\r\n\r\nOil of caraway distilled in England from home-grown caraways is\r\npreferred in this country. On the Continent, that extracted from the\r\ncaraways of Halle and Holland is considered to be of finer flavour than\r\nthe oil obtained from those of Southern Germany.\r\n\r\nThe immature fruit of caraway is rich in tannic matter, striking blue\r\nwith a salt of iron. It occurs abundantly in the tissue around the\r\noil-ducts, where the presence of sugar may be also detected by alkaline\r\ntartrate of copper. Sugar occurs likewise in the embryo, but not in the\r\nalbumen, in which latter protein substances predominate.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—Caraways are exported from Finmark, the most\r\nnortherly province of Norway; from Finland and Russia. In Germany, the\r\ncultivation, recommended by Gleditsch in 1776, is now largely carried\r\non in Moravia, and in Prussia, especially in the neighbourhood of\r\nHalle. The districts of Erfurt and Merseburg, also in Prussia, are\r\nstated to yield annually about 30,000 cwt. Dutch caraways are produced\r\nin the provinces of North Holland, Gelderland and North Brabant, in the\r\nlatter two from wild plants.[1173] Caraways are frequently shipped from\r\nthe ports of Morocco; the quantity exported thence in 1872 was 952 cwt.\r\nand 288 cwt. in 1875.[1174]\r\n\r\nThe import of caraways into the United Kingdom in 1870 amounted to\r\n19,160 cwt., almost all being from Holland.\r\n\r\nThe essential oil is manufactured on a large scale. According to\r\na statement of the Chamber of Commerce of Leipzig,[1175] four\r\nestablishments of that district produced in 1872 no less a quantity\r\nthan 30,955 kilo. (68,277 lb.), valued at £24,000.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Caraway in the form of essential oil or distilled water is used\r\nin medicine as an aromatic stimulant, or as a flavouring ingredient.\r\nBut the consumption in Europe is far more important as a spice, in\r\nbread, cakes, cheese, pastry, confectionary, sauces, etc., or in the\r\nform of oil as an ingredient of alcoholic liquors. The oil is also used\r\nfor the scenting of soap.\r\n\r\n[1172] _Pharm. Journ._ vii.

(_Anethum Fœniculum_\r\nL.), an erect, branching plant with an herbaceous stem and perennial\r\nrootstock, growing to the height of 3 or 4 feet, having leaves 3 or 3\r\ntimes pinnate with narrow linear segments. In allusion to the latter\r\nthe plant had also been named _Fœniculum capillaceum_ by Gilibert.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be truly indigenous to the countries extending from the\r\nCaspian regions (or even China?) to the Mediterranean and the Greek\r\nPeninsula, but is a doubtful native in many parts of Central and\r\nSouthern Russia. The plant on the other hand is also found apparently\r\nwild, over a large portion of Western Europe as far as the British\r\nIsles, especially in the vicinity of the sea.\r\n\r\nFennel is largely cultivated in the central parts of Europe, as Saxony,\r\nFranconia and Wurtemberg, also in the South of France about Nîmes, and\r\nin Italy. It is extensively grown in India and China. The Indian plant\r\nis an annual of somewhat low stature.[1176]\r\n\r\nThe plant varies in stature, foliage, and in the size and form of its\r\nfruits; but all the forms belong apparently to a single species.\r\n\r\n=History=—Fennel was used by the ancient Romans, as well for its\r\naromatic fruits, as for its edible succulent shoots. It was also\r\nemployed in Northern Europe at a remote period, as it is constantly\r\nmentioned in the Anglo-Saxon medical receipts, which date as early\r\nat least as the 11th century. The diffusion of the plant in Central\r\nEurope was stimulated by Charlemagne, who enjoined its cultivation on\r\nthe imperial farms. Fennel shoots (_turiones fœnuculi_), fennel water,\r\nand fennel seed, as well as anise, are all mentioned in an ancient\r\nrecord[1177] of Spanish agriculture dating A.D. 961.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fennel fruits of commerce, commonly called _Fennel\r\nSeeds_, are of several kinds and of very different pecuniary value. The\r\nfollowing are the principal sorts:—\r\n\r\n1. _Sweet Fennel_,—known also as _Roman Fennel_, is cultivated in the\r\nneighbourhood of Nîmes in the south of France. The plant is a tall\r\nperennial with large umbels of 25 to 30 rays.[1178] As the plants grow\r\nold, the fruits of each succeeding season gradually change in shape\r\nand diminish in size, till at the end of 4 or 5 years they are hardly\r\nto be distinguished from those of the wild fennel growing in the same\r\ndistrict. This curious fact, remarked by Tabernæmontanus (1588), was\r\nexperimentally proved by Guibourt.[1179]\r\n\r\n[1176] It is an annual even in England, ripening seeds in its first\r\nyear, and then dying.\r\n\r\n[1177] _Le Calendrier de Cordoue de l’année_, 961, publié par R. Dozy,\r\nLeyde, 1873.\r\n\r\n[1178] The Nîmes fennel has been usually referred to _Fœniculum dulce_\r\nDC., but that plant has the stem compressed at the base, and only 6 to\r\n8 rays in the umbel; and is the fennel which is eaten as a vegetable or\r\nas a salad.\r\n\r\n[1179] _Hist. des Drogues_, iii. (1869) 233.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of Sweet Fennel as found in the shops are oblong,\r\ncylindrical, about ⁴/₁₀ of an inch in length by ⅒ in diameter, more or\r\nless arched, terminating with the two-pointed base of the style, and\r\nsmooth on the surface. Each pericarp is marked by 5 prominent ridges,\r\nthe lateral being thicker than the dorsal. Between the ridges lie\r\nvittæ, and there are two vittæ on the commissural surface,—all filled\r\nwith dark oily matter. The fruits seen in bulk have a pale greenish\r\nhue; their odour is aromatic, and they have a pleasant, saccharine,\r\nspicy taste.\r\n\r\n2. _German Fennel_, _Saxon Fennel_, produced especially near\r\nWeissenfels in the Prussian province of Saxony; the fruits are ²/₁₀\r\nto ¼ of an inch long, ovoid-oblong, a little compressed laterally,\r\nslightly curved, terminating in a short conical stylopodium; they are\r\nglabrous, of a deep brown, each mericarp marked with 5 conspicuous pale\r\nridges, of which the lateral are the largest. Seen in bulk, the fruits\r\nhave a greenish brown hue; they have an aromatic saccharine taste, with\r\nthe peculiar smell of fennel.\r\n\r\n3. _Wild or Bitter Fennel_ (_Fenouil amer_), collected in the south of\r\nFrance, where the plant grows without cultivation. They are smaller\r\nand broader than those of the German Fennel, being from ⅕ to ⅙ of an\r\ninch long by about ¹/₁₅ of an inch wide. They have less prominent\r\nridges and at maturity are a little scurfy in the furrows and on the\r\ncommissure. Their taste is bitterish, spicy, and strongly fennel-like.\r\nThe essential oil (_Essence de Fenouil amer_) is distilled from the\r\nentire herb.\r\n\r\n4. _Indian Fennel._—A sample in our possession from Bombay resembles\r\nSweet Fennel, but the fruits are not so long, and are usually straight.\r\nThe mother plant of this drug is _F. Panmorium_ DC., now regarded as a\r\nsimple variety of _F. vulgare_ Gärtn.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The most marked peculiarity of fennel is\r\nexhibited by the vittæ, which are surrounded by a brown tissue. The\r\nlatter is made up of cells resembling the usual form of cork-cells. In\r\nSweet Fennel the vittæ are smaller than in the German fruit; in the\r\ntransverse section of the latter, the largest diameter of these ducts\r\nis about 200 mkm.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most important constituent of fennel fruits\r\nis the volatile oil, which is afforded both by the Sweet and the German\r\nfennel to the extent of about 3½ per cent.\r\n\r\nOil of fennel, from whatever variety of the drug obtained, consists of\r\n_Anethol_ (or Anise-camphor)\r\n\r\n         {OCH₃\r\n    C₆H₄ {           ,\r\n         {CH·CH·CH₃\r\n\r\nand variable but less considerable proportions of an oil, isomeric with\r\noil of turpentine. Anethol is obtainable from fennel in two forms, the\r\nsolid and the liquid; crystals of the former are deposited when the\r\noil is subjected to a somewhat low temperature; the liquid anethol may\r\nbe got by collecting the portion of the crude oil passing over at 225°\r\nC. The crystals of anethol fuse between 16 and 20°; the liquid form of\r\nanethol remains fluid even at -10° C. By long keeping, the crystals\r\nslowly become liquid and lose their power of reassuming a crystalline\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThree varieties of oil of fennel are found in commerce, namely the oils\r\nof _Sweet Fennel_ and _Bitter Fennel_ offered by the drug-houses of\r\nthe south of France; their money value is as 3 to 1, the oil of sweet\r\nfennel, which has a decidedly _sweet_ taste, being by far the most\r\nesteemed. The third variety is obtained from Saxon fennel, especially\r\nby the manufacturers of Dresden and Leipzig.[1180] We have been\r\nsupplied with type-specimens of the first two oils by the distillers,\r\nMessrs. J. Sagnier, fils, & Cie., Nîmes; a specimen of the third has\r\nbeen distilled in the laboratory of one of ourselves.\r\n\r\nOil of fennel differs from that of anise by displaying a considerable\r\nrotatory power. We found the above-mentioned specimens, examined in a\r\ncolumn 50 mm. long, to deviate the ray of polarized light to the right\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\n    Oil of Sweet Fennel   29°·8\r\n      ”    Bitter  ”       4°·8\r\n      ”    German  ”       9°·1\r\n\r\nThe rotatory power is due to the hydrocarbon contained in the oil; we\r\nascertain that anethol from oil of anise is devoid of it.\r\n\r\nFennel fruits contain sugar, yet their sweetness or bitterness depends\r\non the essential oil rather than on the presence of that body. The\r\nalbumen of the seed contains fixed oil, which amounts to about 12 per\r\ncent. of the fruit.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Fennel fruits are used in medicine in the form of distilled\r\nwater and volatile oil, but to no considerable extent. The chief\r\nconsumption is in cattle medicines, and of the oil in the manufacture\r\nof cordials.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS ANISI.\r\n\r\n_Anise_, _Aniseed_; F. _Fruits d’Anis vert_; G. _Anis_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Pimpinella Anisum_ L., an annual plant, is\r\nindigenous to Asia Minor, the Greek Islands and Egypt, but nowhere to\r\nbe met with undoubtedly growing wild. It is now also cultivated in many\r\nparts of Europe where the summer is hot enough for ripening its fruits,\r\nas well as in India and South America. It is not grown in Britain.\r\n\r\n=History=—Anise, which the ancients obtained chiefly from Crete\r\nand Egypt, is among the oldest of medicines and spices.[1181] It\r\nis mentioned by Theophrastus, by the later writers Dioscorides and\r\nPliny, as well as by Edrisi,[1182] who enumerates anise “sorte de\r\ngraine douce” among the products of Tunisia. In Europe we find that\r\nCharlemagne (A.D. 812) commanded that anise should be cultivated on the\r\nimperial farms in Germany. The Anglo-Saxon writings contain frequent\r\nallusions to the use of dill and cumin, but we have failed to find in\r\nthem any reference to anise, nor in the _Meddygon Myddfai_.\r\n\r\nThe Patent of Pontage granted by Edward I. in 1305 to raise funds for\r\nrepairing the Bridge of London,[1183] enumerates _Anise_ (_anisium_)\r\namong the commodities liable to toll. There are entries for it under\r\nthe name of _Annis vert_ in the account of the expenses of John, king\r\nof France, during his abode in England, 1359-60;[1184] and it is one of\r\nthe spices of which the Grocers’ Company of London had the weighing and\r\noversight from 1453.[1185] By the _Wardrobe Accounts_ of Edward IV.,\r\nA.D. 1480,[1186] it appears that the royal linen was perfumed by means\r\nof “lytill bagges of fustian stuffed with ireos and _anneys_.”\r\n\r\n[1180] The Leipzig Chamber of Commerce reports the quantity made by\r\nfour establishments in 1872, as 4350 kilo. (9594 lb.).\r\n\r\n[1181] On the _Anise_ of the Bible, see note in our article Fructus\r\nAnethi.\r\n\r\n[1182] Page 150 of the “_Description_,” etc., quoted in the article\r\nFructus Carui, p. 305, note 5.\r\n\r\n[1183] (Thomson, R.), _Chronicles of London Bridge_, 1827. 156.\r\n\r\n[1184] Doüet d’Arcq, _Comptes de l’Argenterie des Rois de France_,\r\n1851. 206. 220.\r\n\r\n[1185] Herbert, _Hist. of the twelve Great Livery Companies of London_,\r\n1834, 310.\r\n\r\n[1186] Edited by N.

They are of ovoid form, tapering towards\r\nthe summit, which is crowned by a pair of short styles rising from a\r\nthick stylopode; they are nearly cylindrical, but a little constricted\r\ntowards the commissure. Each fruit is marked by 10 light-coloured\r\nridges which give it a prismatic form; these as well as the rest of\r\nthe surface of the fruit, are clothed with short rough hairs. The drug\r\nhas a greyish brown hue, a spicy saccharine taste, and an agreeable\r\naromatic smell.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The most striking peculiarity of anise fruit\r\nis the large number of oil-ducts or vittæ it contains; each half of\r\nthe fruit exhibits in transverse section nearly 30 oil-ducts, of which\r\nthe 4 to 6 in the commissure are by far the largest. The hairs display\r\na simple structure, inasmuch as they are the elongated cells of the\r\nepidermis a little rounded at the end.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The only important constituent of anise is the\r\nessential oil (_Oleum Anisi_), which the fruits afford to the extent\r\nof 3 per cent. from the best Moravian sort; Russian anise yields from\r\n2·5 to 2·7 per cent., the German 2·3 per cent.[1189] This oil is a\r\ncolourless liquid, having an agreeable odour of anise and a sweetish\r\naromatic taste; its sp. gr. varies from 0·977 to 0·983. At 10° to 15°\r\nC., it solidifies to a hard crystalline mass, which does not resume its\r\nfluidity till the temperature rises to about 17° C.\r\n\r\nOil of anise resembles the oils of fennel, star-anise, and tarragon,\r\nin that it consists almost wholly of _Anethol_ or _Anise-camphor_\r\ndescribed in the previous article (p. 309). This fact explains the\r\nrotatory power of oil of anise being inferior to that of fennel. Oil\r\nof German anise, distilled by one of us, examined under the conditions\r\nstated, page 310, deviated only 1°·7, but to the left. _Franck_ (1868)\r\nfound oil of Saxon anise deviating 1°·1 to the right.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—Anise is produced in Malta, about Alicante in\r\nSpain, in Touraine and Guienne in France, in Puglia (Southern Italy),\r\nin several parts of Northern and Central Germany, Bohemia and Moravia.\r\nThe Russian provinces of Orel, Tula and Woronesh, south of Moscow, also\r\nproduce excellent anise, and in Southern Russia, Charkow is likewise\r\nknown for the production of this drug. In Greece, anise is largely\r\ncultivated under the name of γλυάισον, and it is much grown in Northern\r\nIndia. Considerable quantities are also now imported from Chili. The\r\ndrug is, on the whole, always of a remarkably uniform appearance.\r\n\r\n[1187] Reprinted for the Early English Text Society, 1870. 281.\r\n\r\n[1188] _Rates of Marchandizes_, 1635.\r\n\r\n[1189] Laboratory notes obligingly furnished by Messrs. Schimmel & Co.,\r\nLeipzig. (1878).\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Anise is an aromatic stimulant and carminative, usually\r\nadministered in the form of essential oil as an adjunct to other\r\nmedicines. It is also used as a cattle medicine. The essential oil is\r\nlargely consumed in the manufacture of cordials, chiefly in France,\r\nSpain, Italy, and South America.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The fruits of anise are sometimes mixed with those of\r\nhemlock, but whether by design or by carelessness we know not. Careful\r\ninspection with a lens will reveal this dangerous adulteration. We have\r\nknown _powdered_ anise also to contain hemlock, and have detected it\r\nby trituration in a mortar with a few drops of solution of potash, a\r\nsample of pure anise for comparison being tried at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe essential oil of aniseed may readily be confounded with that of\r\nStar-anise, which is distilled from the fruits of the widely different\r\n_Illicium anisatum_. As stated at p. 22, these oils agree so closely\r\nin their chemical and optical properties, that no scientific means are\r\nknown for distinguishing them.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX SUMBUL.\r\n\r\n_Sumbul Root_; F. _Racine de Sumbul_, _Sambola ou Sambula_; G.\r\n_Moschuswurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Ferula Sumbul_ Hooker fil. (_Euryangium Sumbul_\r\nKauffmann[1190]), a tall perennial plant discovered in 1869 by a\r\nRussian traveller, Fedschenko, in the mountains of Maghian near\r\nPianjakent, in the northern part of the Khanat of Bukhara, nearly 40°\r\nN. lat., and 68° to 69° E. long. From Wittmann’s statements (1876) it\r\nwould appear that the Sumbul plant abounds far east from that country,\r\nin the coast province of the Amoor. A living plant transmitted from the\r\nformer district to the Botanical Garden of Moscow flowered there in\r\n1871, another in 1875 at Kew, where the plant died after flowering.\r\n\r\n[1190] _Nouv. Mém. de la Soc. imp. des Nat. de Moscou_, xii. (1871)\r\n253. tabb. 24. 25.—Also figured in Bentley and Trimen, _Med. Plants_,\r\npart 20 (1877).\r\n\r\n=History=—The word _sumbul_, which is Arabic and signifies _an ear_\r\nor _spike_, is used as the designation of various substances, but\r\nespecially of _Indian Nard_, the rhizome of _Nardostachys Jatamansi_\r\nDC. Under what circumstances, or at what period, it came to be applied\r\nto the drug under notice, we know not. Nor are we better informed as to\r\nthe history of sumbul root, which we have been unable to trace by means\r\nof any of the works at our disposal. All we can say is, that the drug\r\nwas first introduced into Russia about the year 1835 as a substitute\r\nfor musk, that it was then recommended as a remedy for cholera, and\r\nthat it began to be known in Germany in 1840, and ten years afterwards\r\nin England. It was admitted into the _British Pharmacopœia_ in 1867.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The root as found in commerce consists of transverse\r\nslices, 1 to 2 inches, rarely as much as 5 inches in diameter, and\r\nan inch or more in thickness; the bristly crown, and tapering lower\r\nportions, often no thicker than a quill, are also met with. The outside\r\nis covered by a dark papery bark; the inner surface of the slices is of\r\na dirty brown, marbled with white, showing when viewed with a lens an\r\nabundant resinous exudation, especially towards the circumference. The\r\ninterior is a spongy, fibrous, farinaceous-looking substance, having a\r\npleasant musky odour and a bitter aromatic taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The interior tissue of sumbul root is very\r\nirregularly constructed of woody and medullary rays, while the cortical\r\npart exhibits a loose spongy parenchyme. The structural peculiarity of\r\nthe root becomes obvious, if thin slices are moistened with solution\r\nof iodine, when the medullary rays assume by reason of the starch they\r\ncontain an intense blue. The structure of the root differs from the\r\nusual arrangement by the formation of independent secondary cambial\r\nzones with fibro-vascular bundles within the original cambium. Similar\r\npeculiarities are also displayed by the roots of Myrrhis odorata,\r\nConvolvulus Scammonia, Ipomœa Turpethum and others.[1191] Large\r\nbalsam-ducts are also observable in Sumbul as well as in the roots of\r\nmany other Umbelliferæ.[1192]\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Sumbul root yields about 9 per cent. of a soft\r\nbalsamic resin soluble in ether, and ⅓ per cent. of a dingy bluish\r\nessential oil. The resin has a musky smell, not fully developed until\r\nafter contact with water. According to Reinsch (1848), it dissolves in\r\nstrong sulphuric acid with a fine blue colour, but in our experience\r\nwith a crimson brown. The same chemist states that when subjected to\r\ndry distillation, it yields a blue oil.\r\n\r\nSolution of potash is stated to convert the resin of sumbul into a\r\ncrystalline potassium salt of _Sumbulamic Acid_, which latter was\r\nobtained in a crystalline state by Reinsch in 1843, but has not been\r\nfurther examined. Sumbulamic acid, which smells strongly of musk,\r\nappears to be a different substance from _Sumbulic_ or _Sumbulolic\r\nAcid_, the potassium salt of which may be extracted by water from the\r\nabove-mentioned alkaline solution. Ricker and Reinsch (1848), assert\r\nthat the last-mentioned acid, of which the root contains about ¾ per\r\ncent., is none other than _Angelic Acid_, accompanied, as in angelica\r\nroot, by a little valerianic acid. All these substances require\r\nfurther investigation, as well as the body called _Sumbulin_, which\r\nwas prepared by Murawjeff (1853), and is said to form with acids,\r\ncrystalline salts.\r\n\r\nSommer has shown (1859) that by dry distillation, sumbul resin\r\nyields _Umbelliferone_, which substance we shall further notice when\r\ndescribing the constituents of galbanum.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Prescribed in the form of tincture as a stimulating tonic.\r\n\r\n[1191] See A. de Bary, _Anatomie_, 1877. 623.\r\n\r\n[1192] The structure and growth of Sumbul root have been elaborately\r\nstudied by Tchistiakoff, of whose observations, first published in\r\nRussian in 1870, an Italian translation with two plates has appeared in\r\nthe _Nuovo Giornale Botanico_ for Oct. 1873. 298.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—_Bombay Sumbul_, or “_Boi_,” is the root of Dorema\r\nAmmoniacum (see article Ammoniacum, p. 324), which is largely\r\nimported into Bombay, being used there in the Parsee fire temples as\r\nan incense.[1193] The largest roots, for which we are indebted to\r\nProfessor Dymock, are three inches in diameter at the crown, by 8\r\ninches in length. They are easily distinguished from the Sumbul by\r\ntheir decidedly yellowish hue as well as by the absence of any musky\r\nodour. We extracted by alcohol, from the root dried at 100° C., 26 per\r\ncent. of a resin identical with that afforded by commercial Ammoniacum.\r\n\r\nBombay Sumbul agrees with the _Indian Sumbul_ as described by\r\nPereira.[1194]\r\n\r\n\r\nASAFŒTIDA.\r\n\r\n_Gummi-resina Asafœtida vel Assafœtida_; _Asafœtida_; F. _Asafœtida_;\r\nG. _Asant_, _Stinkasant_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—Two perennial umbelliferous plants are now generally\r\ncited as the source of this drug; but though they are both capable\r\nof affording a gum-resin of strong alliaceous odour, it has not been\r\nproved that either of them furnishes the asafœtida of commerce. The\r\nplants in question are:—\r\n\r\n1. _Ferula Narthex_ Boiss. (_Narthex Asafœtida_ Falconer), a gigantic\r\nherbaceous plant, having a large root several inches in thickness, the\r\ncrown of which is clothed with coarse bristly fibres; it has an erect\r\nstem attaining 10 feet in height, throwing out from near its base\r\nupwards a regular series of branches bearing compound umbels, each\r\nbranch proceeding from the axil of a large sheathing inflated petiole,\r\nthe upper of which are destitute of lamina. The radical leaves, 1½ feet\r\nlong, are bipinnate with broadly ligulate obtuse lobes. It has a large\r\nflat fruit with winged margin. When wounded, the plant exudes a milky\r\njuice having a powerful smell of asafœtida. It commences to grow in\r\nearly spring, rapidly throwing up its foliage, which dies away at the\r\nbeginning of summer. It does not flower till the root has acquired a\r\nconsiderable size and is several years old.\r\n\r\n_F. Narthex_, which now exists in several botanic gardens and has\r\nflowered twice in that of Edinburgh, was discovered by Falconer in\r\n1838, in the valley of Astor or Hasora (35° N. lat., 74°·30 E. long.\r\nnorth of Kashmir).[1195]\r\n\r\n2. _Ferula Scorodosma_ Bentham et Hooker (_Scorodosma fœtidum_ Bunge;\r\n_Ferula Assa fœtida_ L. in Boissier, Flora orientalis ii. 994)—In form\r\nof leaf, in the bristly summit of the root, and in general aspect, this\r\nplant resembles the preceding; but it has the stem (5 to 7 feet high)\r\nnearly naked, with the umbels, which are very numerous, collected at\r\nthe summit; and the few stem-leaves have not the voluminous sheathing\r\npetioles that are so striking a feature in _Narthex_. In _Narthex_,\r\nthe vittæ of the fruit are conspicuous,—in _Scorodosma_ almost\r\nobsolete; but the development of these organs in feruloid plants varies\r\nconsiderably, and has been rejected by Bentham and Hooker as affording\r\nno important distinctive character. _Scorodosma_ is apparently more\r\npubescent than _Narthex_.\r\n\r\n[1193] _Pharm. Journ._ vi. (1875) 321.\r\n\r\n[1194] Elements of _Mat. Med._ ii. p. 2 (1857) 208; also Bentley,\r\n_Pharm. Journ._ ix. (1878) 479.\r\n\r\n[1195] We refrain from citing localities in Tibet, Beluchistan and\r\nPersia, where plants supposed to agree with that of Falconer have been\r\nfound by other collectors.\r\n\r\n_F. Scorodosma_ was discovered by Lehmann in 1841, in the sandy deserts\r\neastwards of the Sea of Aral, and also on the hills of the Karatagh\r\nrange south of the river Zarafshan,—that is to say, south-east of\r\nSamarkand. In 1858-59, it was observed by Bunge about Herat. At nearly\r\nthe same period, it was afresh collected between the Caspian and Sea of\r\nAral, and in the country lying eastward of the latter, by Borszczow,\r\na Russian botanist, who has made it the subject of an elaborate and\r\nvaluable memoir.[1196]\r\n\r\nThe most detailed account of the asafœtida plant we possess is that\r\nof the German traveller Engelbert Kämpfer, who in 1687 observed it in\r\nthe Persian province of Laristan, between the river Shúr and the town\r\nof Kongún, also in the neighbourhood of the town of Dusgan or Disgun,\r\nin which latter locality[1197] alone he saw the gum-resin collected.\r\nHe states that he found the plant also growing near Herat. Kämpfer has\r\ngiven figures of his plant which he calls _Asa fœtida Disgunensis_, and\r\nhis specimens consisting of remnants of leaves, a couple of mericarps\r\n(in a bad state) and a piece of the stem a few inches long, are still\r\npreserved in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThese materials have been the subject of much study, in order to\r\ndetermine which of the asafœtida plants of modern botanists should be\r\nidentified with that of Kämpfer. Falconer and Borszczow have arrived\r\nin turns at the conclusion that his own plant accords with Kämpfer’s.\r\nBut Kämpfer’s figures agree well neither with _Narthex_ nor with\r\n_Scorodosma_. The plant they represent does not form, it would seem,\r\nthe branching pyramid of the _Narthex_ (as it flowered at Edinburgh),\r\nnor has it the multitude of umbels seen in Borszczow’s figure of\r\n_Scorodosma_.[1198]\r\n\r\nWhether Kämpfer’s plant is really identical with either of those we\r\nhave noticed, and whether the discrepancies observable are due to\r\ncareless drawing, or to actual difference, are points that cannot be\r\nsettled without the examination of more ample specimens.\r\n\r\nGreat allowance must be made for the period of growth at which these\r\nplants have been observed. Kämpfer saw his plant when quite mature, and\r\nnot when its stem was young and flowering. _Narthex_ is scarcely known\r\nexcept from specimens grown at Edinburgh, those obtained by Falconer\r\nin Tibet having been gathered when dry and withered. Even Borszczow’s\r\nplant appears never to have been seen by any botanist while its\r\nflower-stem was in a growing state.\r\n\r\nHistory—Whether the substance which the ancients called _Laser_ was\r\nthe same as the modern _Asafœtida_ is a question that has been often\r\ndiscussed during the last three hundred years, and it is one upon which\r\nwe shall attempt to offer no further evidence. Suffice it to say that\r\n_Laser_ is mentioned along with products of India and Persia, among\r\nthe articles on which duty was levied at the Roman custom-house of\r\nAlexandria in the 2nd century.\r\n\r\n“_Hingu_,” doubtless meaning Asafœtida, occurs in many Sanskrit works,\r\nespecially in epic poetry, but also in Susruta.\r\n\r\n[1196] _Die Pharmaceutisch-wichtigen Ferulaceen der Aralo-Caspischen\r\nWüste_, St. Petersb. 1860, pp. 40, eight plates.—In the _Medicinal\r\nplants_ of Bentley and Trimen, Narthex is figured in part 29 and\r\nScorodosma in part 24.\r\n\r\n[1197] Which we cannot find on any map.\r\n\r\n[1198] Kämpfer figures his plant with about 6 umbels on a stalk, while\r\n_Scorodosma_, as represented by Borszczow, has at least 25.\r\n\r\nAsafœtida was certainly known to the Arabian and Persian geographers\r\nand travellers of the middle ages. One of these, Ali Istakhri, a native\r\nof Istakir, the ancient Persepolis, who lived in the 10th century,\r\nstates[1199] that it produced abundantly in the desert between Sistan\r\nand Makran, and is much used by the people as a condiment. The region\r\nin question comprises a portion of Beluchistan.\r\n\r\nThe geographer Edrisi,[1200] who wrote about the middle of the 12th\r\ncentury, asserts that asafœtida, called in Arabic _Hiltit_, is\r\ncollected largely in a district of Afghanistan near Kaleh Bust, at the\r\njunction of the Helmand with the Arghundab, a locality still producing\r\nthe drug. Other Arabian writers as quoted by Ibn Baytar,[1201] describe\r\nasafœtida in terms which show it to have been well known and much\r\nvalued.\r\n\r\nMatthæus Platearius, who flourished in the second half of the 12th\r\ncentury, mentions asafœtida in his work on simple medicines, known as\r\n_Circa instans_, which was held in great esteem during the middle ages.\r\nIt is also named a little later by Otho of Cremona,[1202] who remarks\r\nthat the more fœtid the drug, the better its quality. Like other\r\nproductions of the East, asafœtida found its way in European commerce\r\nduring the middle ages through the trading cities of Italy. It is\r\nworthy of remark that it is much less frequently mentioned by the older\r\nwriters than galbanum, sagapenum and opopanax. In the 13th century, the\r\n“Physicians of Myddfai” in Wales,[1203] considered asafœtida as one of\r\nthe substances which every physician “ought to know and use.”\r\n\r\n=Collection=—The collecting of asafœtida on the mountains about Dusgun\r\nin Laristan in Persia, as described by Kämpfer,[1204] is performed\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\nThe peasants repair to the localities where the plants abound, about\r\nthe middle of April, at which time the latter have ceased growing, and\r\ntheir leaves begin to show signs of withering. The soil surrounding the\r\nplant is removed to the depth of a span, so as to bare a portion of the\r\nroot. The leaves are then pulled off, the soil is replaced, and over\r\nit are laid the leaves and other herbage, with a stone to keep them in\r\nplace, the whole being arranged in this way to prevent injury to the\r\nroot by the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\n[1199] _Buch der Länder_, translated by Mordtmann, Hamburg, 1845. 111.\r\n\r\n[1200] _Géographie d’Edrisi_, traduite par Jaubert, i.

Having first removed\r\nthe leaves and earth, a thinnish slice is taken from the fibrous crown\r\nof the root, and two days later the juice is scraped from the flat cut\r\nsurface. The root is again sheltered, care being taken that nothing\r\nrests on it. This operation is repeated twice in the course of the next\r\nfew days, a very thin slice being removed from the root after each\r\nscraping. The product got during the first cutting is called _shīr_,\r\ni.e. _milk_, and is thinner and more milky and less esteemed than\r\nthat obtained afterwards. It is not sold in its natural state, but is\r\nmixed with soft earth (_terra limosa_) which is added to the extent of\r\nan equal, or even double, weight of the gum-resin, according to the\r\nsoftness of the latter.\r\n\r\nAfter the last cutting, the roots are allowed to rest 8 or 10 days,\r\nwhen a thicker exudation called _pispaz_, more esteemed than the first,\r\nis obtained by a similar process carried on at intervals during June\r\nand July, or even later, until the root is quite exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe only recent account of the production of asafœtida that we have\r\nmet with, is that of Staff-surgeon H. W. Bellew, who witnessed the\r\ncollection of the drug in 1857 in the neighbourhood of Kandahar.[1205]\r\nThe frail withered stem of the previous year with the cluster of\r\nnewly-sprouted leaves, is cut away from the top of the root, around\r\nwhich a trench of 6 inches wide and as many deep, is dug in the earth.\r\nSeveral deep incisions are now made in the upper part of the root, and\r\nthis operation is repeated every 3 or 4 days as the sap continues to\r\nexude, which goes on for a week or two according to the strength of the\r\nplant. The juice collects in tears about the top of the root, or when\r\nvery abundant flows into the hollow around it. In all cases as soon as\r\nincisions are made, the root is covered with a bundle of loose twigs\r\nor herbs, or even with a heap of stones, to protect it from the drying\r\neffects of the sun. The quantity of gum-resin obtained is variable;\r\nsome roots yield scarcely half an ounce, others as much as two pounds.\r\nSome of the roots are no larger than a carrot, others attain the\r\nthickness of a man’s leg. The drug is said to be mostly adulterated\r\nbefore it leaves the country, by admixture of powdered gypsum or flour.\r\nThe finest sort, which is generally sold pure, is obtained solely “from\r\nthe node or leaf-bud in the centre of the root-head.” At Kandahar, the\r\nprice of this superior drug is equivalent to from 2_s._ 8_d._ to 4_s._\r\n8_d._ per lb, while the ordinary sort is worth but from 1_s._ to 2_s._\r\n\r\nDuring a journey from North-western India to Teheran in Persia, through\r\nBeluchistan and Afghanistan, performed in the spring of 1872, the\r\nsame traveller observed the asafœtida plant in great abundance on\r\nmany of the elevated undulating pasture-covered plains and hills of\r\nAfghanistan, and of the Persian province of Khorassan. He states that\r\nthe plant is of two kinds, the one called _Kamá-i-gawí_ which is grazed\r\nby cattle and used as a potherb, and the other known as _Kamá-i-angúza_\r\nwhich affords the gum-resin of commerce. The collecting of this last\r\nis almost exclusively in the hands of the western people of the Kákarr\r\ntribe, one of the most numerous and powerful of the Afghan clans, who,\r\nwhen thus occupied, spread their camps over the plains of Kandahar to\r\nthe confines of Herat.[1206]\r\n\r\nWood, in his journey to the source of the Oxus, found asafœtida to\r\nbe largely produced in a district to the north of this, namely the\r\nmountains around Saigan or Sykan (lat. 35° 10, long. 67° 40), where,\r\nsays he, the land affording the plant is as regularly apportioned out\r\nand as carefully guarded as the cornfields on the plain.[1207]\r\n\r\n[1205] _Journal of a Mission to Afghanistan_, Lond. 1862. 270.\r\n\r\n[1206] Bellew, _From the Indus to the Tigris_, London. 1874. 101. 102.\r\n286. 321. &c.\r\n\r\n[1207] Wood, _Journey to the Source of the River Oxus_, new ed. 1872,\r\n131.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The best asafœtida is that consisting chiefly of slightly\r\nor not agglutinated tears. This is the _Kandahari-Hing_ of the Bombay\r\nmarket, which is not always to be met with in Bombay, and even there\r\nis only used by wealthy people as a condiment. It is not exported to\r\nEurope. The best sort shipped to Europe is the _Anguzeh-i-Lari_, coming\r\nfrom Laristan by way of Afghanistan and the Bolan Pass to Bombay. It\r\nshows agglutinated tears, or when freshly imported, it forms a clammy\r\nyet hard yellowish-grey mass, in which opaque, white or yellowish milky\r\ntears, sometimes an inch or two long, are more or less abundant.\r\n\r\nSometimes asafœtida is imported as a fluid honey-like mass, apparently\r\npure. We presume that such is that of the first gathering, which\r\nKämpfer says is called _milk_. The drug is often adulterated with\r\nearthy matter which renders it very ponderous; it must be granted that\r\nan addition of such matters may often be necessary in order to enable\r\nthe drug to be transported. This earthy or stony asafœtida constitutes\r\nat Bombay a distinct article of commerce under the name of _Hingra_.\r\n\r\nBy exposure to air, asafœtida acquires a bright pink and then a brown\r\nhue. The perfectly pure tears display when fractured a conchoidal\r\nsurface, which changes from milky white to purplish pink in the course\r\nof some hours. If a tear is touched with nitric acid sp. gr. 1·2, it\r\nassumes for a short time a fine green colour.\r\n\r\nWhen asafœtida is rubbed in a mortar with oil of vitriol, then diluted\r\nwith water and neutralized, the slightly coloured solution exhibits\r\na bluish fluorescence. The same will be observed, to some extent, if\r\ntears of the drug are immersed in water and a little ammonia is added.\r\nThe tears of asafœtida when warmed become adhesive, but by cold are\r\nrendered so brittle that they may be powdered. With water they easily\r\nform a white emulsion.\r\n\r\nThe drug has a powerful and persistent alliaceous odour and a bitter\r\nacrid alliaceous taste.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Asafœtida consists of resin, gum and essential\r\noil, in varying proportions, but the resin generally amounting to more\r\nthan one-half.\r\n\r\nAs to the oil, we have repeatedly obtained from 6 to 9 per cent. by\r\ndistilling it from common copper stills. It is light yellow, has a\r\nrepulsive, very pungent odour of asafœtida, tastes at first mild, then\r\nirritating, but does not stimulate like oil of mustard when applied to\r\nthe skin. It is neutral, but after exposure to the air acquires an acid\r\nreaction and different odour; it evolves sulphuretted hydrogen. In the\r\nfresh state, the oil is free from oxygen; it begins to boil at 135° to\r\n140° C., but with continued evolution of hydrogen sulphide, so that we\r\ndid not succeed in preparing it of constant composition, the amount of\r\nsulphur varying from 20 to 25 per cent. We found it to have a sp. gr.\r\nof 0·951 at 25°, and a strong dextrogyrate power. If one drop of it is\r\nallowed to float on water it assumes a fine violet hue by vapours of\r\nbromine.\r\n\r\nThe essential oil of asafœtida submitted to fractional distillation\r\nyielded us, at 300°, a considerable proportion of a most _beautifully\r\nblue coloured_ oil. By very cautiously oxidizing the crude oil, we\r\nobtained a small amount of extremely deliquescent crystals of a\r\nsulphonic acid. Sodium or potassium decomposes the oil with evolution\r\nof gas, forming potassium sulphide; the residual oil is found to have\r\nthe odour of cinnamon.\r\n\r\nThe resin of asafœtida is not wholly soluble in ether or in chloroform,\r\nbut dissolves with decomposition in warm concentrated nitric acid. It\r\ncontains a little _Ferulaic Acid_,\r\n\r\n    C₆H₃(OCH₃)CH·CH·COOH,\r\n        (OH )\r\n\r\ndiscovered by Hlasiwetz and Barth in 1866, crystallizing in iridescent\r\nneedles soluble in boiling water; it is homologous with _Eugetic Acid_,\r\n\r\n    C₆H₂(OCH₃)COOH,\r\n        (OH )CH·CH·CH₃,\r\n\r\nwhich is to be obtained by adding CO₂ to the molecule of eugenol (page\r\n284).\r\n\r\nFerulaic acid may be obtained from vanillin,\r\n\r\n         {OCH₃\r\n    C₆H₃ {OH          (see article Vanilla).\r\n         {CHO\r\n\r\nFused with potash, ferulaic acid yields oxalic and carbonic acids,\r\nseveral acids of the fatty series, and protocatechuic acid. The resin\r\nitself treated in like manner after it has been previously freed from\r\ngum, yields resorcin; and by dry distillation, oils of a green, blue,\r\nviolet or red tint, besides about ¼ per cent. of _Umbelliferone_,\r\nC₉H₆O₃.\r\n\r\nThe mucilaginous matter of asafœtida consists of a smaller part soluble\r\nin water and an insoluble portion. The former yields a neutral solution\r\nwhich is not precipitated by neutral acetate of lead. The insoluble\r\npart is readily dissolved by caustic lye and again separates on\r\naddition of acids.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The drug is at the present day produced exclusively in\r\nAfghanistan. Much of it is shipped in the Persian Gulf for Bombay,\r\nwhence it is conveyed to Europe; it is also brought into India by way\r\nof Peshawur, and by the Bolan pass in Beluchistan.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1872-73, there were imported into Bombay by sea, chiefly\r\nfrom the Persian Gulf, 3367 cwt. of asafœtida, and 4780 cwt. of the\r\nimpure form of the drug called _Hingra_. The value of the latter is\r\nscarcely a fifth that of the genuine kind. The export of asafœtida from\r\nBombay to Europe is very small in comparison with the shipments to\r\nother ports of India.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Asafœtida is reputed stimulant and antispasmodic. It is in great\r\ndemand on the Continent, but is little employed in Great Britain. Among\r\nthe Mahommedan as well as Hindu population of India, it is generally\r\nused as a condiment, and is eaten especially with the various pulses\r\nknown as _dāl_. In regions where the plant grows, the fresh leaves are\r\ncooked as an article of diet.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The systematic adulteration, chiefly with earthy matter\r\nalready pointed out, may be estimated by exhausting the drug with\r\nalcohol and incinerating the residue.\r\n\r\nAllied Substances.\r\n\r\n_Hing from Abushahir_, also in Bombay simply called _Hing_.\r\n\r\nAmong the natives of Bombay, a peculiar form of asafœtida is in\r\nuse that commands a much higher price than those just described;\r\nit is also the only kind admitted there in the government sanitary\r\nestablishmente. This is the _Abushaheree Hing_, imported from Abushir\r\n(Bender Bushehr) and Bender Abassi on the Persian Gulf. It is the\r\nproduct of _Ferula alliacea_ Boiss.[1208] (_F. Asafœtida_ Boiss. et\r\nBuhse, non Linn.) discovered in 1850 by Buhse, and observed in 1858-59\r\nby Bunge in many places in Persia. This Hing is collected near Yezd in\r\nKhorassan, and also in the province of Kerman, the plant being known as\r\n_angúza_, the same name that is applied to _Scorodosma_.\r\n\r\nAbushaheree Hing is never brought into European trade.[1209] It\r\nforms an almost blackish brown, originally _translucent_, brittle\r\nmass, of extremely fœtid alliaceous odour, containing many pieces of\r\nthe stem with no admixture of earth. Guibourt, by whom it was first\r\nnoticed,[1210] was convinced that it had not been obtained from the\r\nroot, but had been _cut from the stem_. He remarks that Theophrastus\r\nalludes to asafœtida (as he terms the _Silphium_[1211] of this author)\r\nas being of two kinds,—the one of the stem, the other of the root; and\r\nthinks the former may be the sort under notice. Vigier,[1212] who calls\r\nit _Asafœtida nauséeux_, found it to contain in 100 parts, of resin and\r\nessential oil 37·5, and gum 23·7.\r\n\r\nWe find the odour of the Hing much more repulsive than that of common\r\nAsafœtida. The former yields an abundance of essential oil, which\r\ndiffers by its reddish hue from that of asafœtida. The oil of Hing,\r\nas distilled by one of us (1877) has also a higher specific gravity,\r\nnamely, 1·02 at 25° C. We find also its rotatory power stronger;\r\nit deviated 38°·8 to the right, when examined in a column of 100\r\nmillimetres in length. The oil of common asafœtida deviated 13°·5 under\r\nthe same conditions.\r\n\r\nBy gently warming the Abushaheree Hing with concentrated hydrochloric\r\nacid, about 1·12 sp. gr., it displays simply a dingy brown hue. By\r\nshaking it with water and a little ammonia no fluorescence is produced.\r\nIn all these respects there is consequently a well-marked difference\r\nbetween the drug under examination and common asafœtida.\r\n\r\n_F. teterrima_ Kar. et Kir., a plant of Soungaria, is likewise\r\nremarkable for its intense alliaceous smell; but the plant is not known\r\nas the source of any commercial product.[1213]\r\n\r\n\r\nGALBANUM.\r\n\r\n_Gummi-resina Galbanum_; _Galbanum_; F. _Galbanum_; G. _Mutterharz_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—The uncertainty that exist as to the plants which\r\nfurnish asafœtida, hangs over those which produce the nearly allied\r\ndrug _Galbanum_. Judging from the characters of the latter, it can\r\nscarcely be doubted that it is yielded by umbelliferous plants of at\r\nleast two species, which are probably the following:[1214]—\r\n\r\n[1208] _Flora Orientalis_, ii. (1872) 995.\r\n\r\n[1209] A large specimen of it was kindly presented to one of us (H.)\r\nby Mr. D. S. Kemp of Bombay. We have also examined the same drug in\r\nthe Indian Museum, and further received good specimens by the kindness\r\nof Professor Dymock. See his notes _Pharm. Journ._ v. (1875) 103, and\r\nviii.

Bunge collected the same plant at Subzawar.\r\nBuhse says that the inhabitants of the district of Demawend collect\r\nthe gum-resin of this plant which is _Galbanum_; the tears which exude\r\nspontaneously from the stem, especially on its lower part and about\r\nthe bases of the leaves, are at first milk-white, but become yellow\r\nby exposure to light and air. It is not the practice, so far as he\r\nobserved, to wound the plant for the purpose of causing the juice to\r\nexude more freely, nor is the gathering of the gum in this district\r\nany special object of industry.[1216] The plant is called in Persian\r\n_Khassuih_, and the Mazanderan dialect _Boridsheh_.\r\n\r\n2. _F. rubricaulis_ Boiss.[1217] (_F. erubescens_ Boiss. ex parte,\r\nAucher _exsicc._ n. 4614, Kotschy n. 666).—This plant was collected\r\nby Kotschy in gorges of the Kuh Dinar range in Southern Persia, and\r\nprobably by Aucher-Eloy on the mountain of Dalmkuh in Northern Persia.\r\nBorszczow,[1218] who regards it as the same as the preceding (though\r\nBoissier[1219] places it in a different section of the genus), says,\r\non the authority of Buhse, that it occurs locally throughout the whole\r\nof Northern Persia, is found in plenty on the slopes of Elwund near\r\nHamadan, here and there on the edge of the great central salt-desert\r\nof Persia, on the mountains near Subzawar, between Ghurian and Kháf,\r\nwest of Herat, and on the desert plateau west of Kháf. He states,\r\nthough not from personal observation, that its gum-resin, which\r\nconstitutes _Persian Galbanum_, is collected for commercial purposes\r\naround Hamadan. _F. rubricaulis_ Boiss. has been beautifully figured by\r\nBerg[1220] under the name of _F. erubescens_.\r\n\r\n=History=—Galbanum, in Hebrew _Chelbenah_, was an ingredient of the\r\nincense used in the worship of the ancient Israelites,[1221] and\r\nis mentioned by the earliest writers on medicine as Hippocrates\r\nand Theophrastus.[1222] Dioscorides states it to be the juice of a\r\n_Narthex_ growing in Syria, and describes its characters, and the\r\nmethod of purifying it by hot water exactly as followed in modern\r\ntimes. We find it mentioned in the 2nd century among the drugs on which\r\nduty was levied at the Roman custom-house at Alexandria.[1223] Under\r\nthe name of _Kinnah_ it was well known to the Arabians, and through\r\nthem to the physicians of the school of Salerno.\r\n\r\n[1215] _Aufzählung der in einer Reise durch Transkaukasien und Persien\r\ngesammelten Pflanzen._—_Nouv.

(1807) 692.\r\n\r\nIn the journal of expenses of John, king of France, during his\r\ncaptivity in England, A.D. 1359-60, there is an entry for the purchase\r\nof 1 lb. of Galbanum which cost 16_s._, 1 lb. of Sagapenum (_Serapin_)\r\nat the same time costing only 2_s._[1224] In common with other products\r\nof the East, these drugs used to reach England by way of Venice, and\r\nare mentioned among the exports of that city to London in 1503.[1225]\r\n\r\nAn edict of Henry III. of France promulgated in 1581, gives the prices\r\nper lb. of the gum-resins of the _Umbelliferæ_ as follows:—Opopanax,\r\n32 sols, Sagapenum 22 sols, Asafœtida 15 sols, Galbanum 10 sols,\r\nAmmoniacum 6 sols 6 deniers.[1226]\r\n\r\n=Description=—Galbanum is met with in drops or tears, adhering _inter\r\nse_ into a mass, usually compact and hard, but sometimes found so soft\r\nas to be fluid. The tears are of the size of a lentil to that of a\r\nhazel-nut, translucent, and of various shades of light brown, yellowish\r\nor faintly greenish. The drug has a peculiar, not unpleasant, aromatic\r\nodour, and a disagreeable, bitter, alliaceous taste.\r\n\r\nIn one variety, the tears are dull and waxy, of a light yellowish\r\ntint when fresh, but becoming of an orange-brown by keeping; they are\r\nbut little disposed to run together, and are sometimes quite dry and\r\nloose, with an odour that somewhat reminds one of savine. In recent\r\nimportations of this form of galbanum, we have noticed a considerable\r\nadmixture of thin transverse slices of the root of the plant, an inch\r\nor more in diameter.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Galbanum contains volatile oil, resin and\r\nmucilage. The first, of which 7 per cent. may be obtained by\r\ndistillation with water, is a colourless or slightly yellowish liquid,\r\npartly consisting of a hydrocarbon, C₁₀H₁₆, boiling at from 170° to\r\n180°. This oil affords easily crystals of terpin, C₁₀H₁₆ + 3OH₂, if it\r\nis treated as mentioned in the article Oleum Cajuputi; it also affords\r\nthe crystallized compound C₁₀H₁₆ + HCl. But the prevailing part of oil\r\nof galbanum consists of hydrocarbons of a much higher boiling point.\r\nThe crude oil has a mild aromatic taste, and deviates the ray of\r\npolarized light to the right.\r\n\r\nThe resin, which we find to constitute about 60 per cent. of the drug,\r\nis very soft, and dissolves in ether or in alkaline liquids, even\r\nin milk of lime, but only partially in bisulphide of carbon. When\r\nheated for some time at 100° C. with hydrochloric acid, it yields\r\n_Umbelliferone_, C₉H₆O₃, which may be dissolved from the acid liquid\r\nby means of ether or chloroform; it is obtained on evaporation in\r\ncolourless acicular crystals. Umbelliferone is soluble in hot water;\r\nits solution exhibits, especially on addition of an alkali, a brilliant\r\nblue fluorescence which is destroyed by an acid. If a small fragment\r\nof galbanum is immersed in water, the fluorescence is immediately\r\nproduced by a drop of ammonia.[1227] The same phenomenon takes place\r\nwith asafœtida, not at all with ammoniacum; it is probably due to\r\ntraces of Umbelliferone pre-existing in the former drugs. By boiling\r\nthe umbelliferone with concentrated caustic lye, it splits up into\r\nresorcin, carbonic acid and formic acid.\r\n\r\n[1224] Doliet d’Arcq, _Comptes de l’Argenterie des Rois de France_\r\n(1851) 236.—The prices must be multiplied by 3 to give a notion of\r\npresent value.\r\n\r\n[1225] Pasi, _Tariffa de Pesi e Misure_, Venet. 1521. 204 (1st edition,\r\n1503).\r\n\r\n[1226] Fontanon, _Edicts et Ordonnances des Rois de France_, ii. (1585)\r\n388.\r\n\r\n[1227] This property of Umbelliferone may be beautifully shown by\r\ndipping some bibulous paper into water which has stood for an hour or\r\ntwo on lumps of galbanum, and drying it. A strip of this paper placed\r\nin a test tube of water with a drop of ammonia, will give a superb blue\r\nsolution, instantly losing its colour on the addition of a drop of\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nUmbelliferone is also produced from many other aromatic umbelliferous\r\nplants, as _Angelica_, _Levisticum_ and _Meum_, when their respective\r\nresins are submitted to dry distillation. According to Zwenger (1860)\r\nit may be likewise obtained from the resin of _Daphne Mezereum_ L. The\r\nyield is always small; it is highest in galbanum, but even in this does\r\nnot much exceed 0·8 per cent. reckoned on the crude drug.\r\n\r\nBy submitting galbanum-resin to dry distillation, there will be\r\nobtained a thick oil of an intense and brilliant blue,[1228] which was\r\nnoticed as early as about the year 1730 by Caspar Neumann of Berlin.\r\nIt is a liquid having an aromatic odour and a bitter acrid taste; in\r\ncold it deposits crystals of umbelliferone, which can be extracted by\r\nrepeatedly shaking the oil with boiling water. A small amount of fatty\r\nacids is also removed at the same time. Submitted to rectification\r\nthe crude oil at first yields a greenish portion and then the superb\r\nblue oil. Kachler (1871) found that it could be resolved by fractional\r\ndistillation into a colourless oil having the formula C₁₀H₁₆, and a\r\nblue oil to which he assigned the composition C₁₀H₁₆O, boiling at\r\n289° C. As to the hydrocarbon, it boils at 240° C., and therefore\r\ndiffers from the essential oil obtained when galbanum is distilled\r\nwith water. The blue oil, after due purification, agrees, according to\r\nKachler, with the blue oil of the flowers of _Matricaria Chamomilla_\r\nL. Each may be transformed by means of potassium into a colourless\r\nhydrocarbon, C₁₀H₁₆; or by anhydride of phosphoric acid into another\r\nproduct, C₁₀H₁₄, likewise colourless. The latter, as well as the former\r\nhydrocarbon, if diluted with ether, and bromine be added, assumes for a\r\nmoment a fine blue tint; the colourless oil as afforded by the drug on\r\ndistillation with water assumes also the same coloration with bromine.\r\n\r\n[1228] We have found it best to mix the galbanum-resin with coarsely\r\npowdered pumice-stone; the oil is then easily and abundantly obtainable.\r\n\r\nBy fusing galbanum-resin with potash, Hlasiwetz and Barth\r\n(1864) obtained crystals (about 6 per cent.) of _Resorcin_ or\r\n_Meta-Dioxybenzol_, together with acetic and volatile fatty acids. The\r\nname of this remarkable substance alludes to Orcin, which had been\r\nextracted in 1829 by Robiquet from lichens. The formula of Resorcin,\r\nC₆H₄(OH)₂, shows at once its relations to Orcin, C₆H₃CH₃(OH)₂.\r\nResorcin has been ascertained to be frequently produced by melting\r\nother resins with potash; it has also been prepared on a large scale\r\nfor the manufacture of the brilliant colouring matter called _Eosin_.\r\nGalbanum-resin treated with nitric acid yields Trinitroresorcin\r\nC₆H(NO₂)₃(OH)₂, the so-called _Styphnic Acid_.\r\n\r\nIf galbanum, or still better its resin, is very moderately warmed with\r\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid, a red hue is developed, which turns\r\nviolet or bluish if spirit of wine is slowly added. Asafœtida treated\r\nin the same way assumes a dingy greenish colour, and _ammoniacum is\r\nnot altered_ at all. This test probably depends upon the formation of\r\nresorcin, which in itself is not coloured by hydrochloric acid, but\r\nassumes a red or blue colour if sugar or mucilage or certain other\r\nsubstances are present. It is remarkable that ammoniacum, though\r\nlikewise yielding resorcin when fused with potash, assumes no red\r\ncolour when warmed with hydrochloric acid. The mucilage of galbanum has\r\nnot been minutely examined.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Galbanum is, we believe, brought into commerce chiefly from\r\nEastern Europe. It is stated that considerable quantities reach Russia\r\nby way of Astrachan and Orenburg.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Galbanum is administered internally as a stimulating\r\nexpectorant, and is occasionally applied in the form of plaster to\r\nindolent swellings.\r\n\r\nAllied Substances.\r\n\r\n_Sagapenum_—This is a gum-resin which, when pure, forms a tough\r\nsoftish mass of closely agglutinated tears. It differs from asafœtida\r\nin forming brownish (not milk-white) tears, which when broken do not\r\nacquire a pink tint; also in not having an alliaceous odour. A good\r\nspecimen presented to us by Professor Dymock of Bombay (1878) reminds\r\nin that and other respects rather of galbanum. We find this sagapenum\r\nto be devoid of sulphur but containing umbelliferone; it is extremely\r\nremarkable for the intense and permanent purely blue colour it\r\nacquires in cold when the smallest fragment of the drug is immersed in\r\nhydrochloric acid 1·13 sp. gr.\r\n\r\nSagapenum, which in mediæval pharmacy was often called _Serapinum_, is\r\nso frequently mentioned by the older writers that it must have been a\r\nplentiful substance. At the present day it can scarcely be procured\r\ngenuine even at Bombay, whither it is sometimes brought from Persia.\r\nThe botanical origin of the drug is unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMMONIACUM.\r\n\r\n_Gummi-resina Ammoniacum_; _Ammoniacum or Gum Ammoniacum_; F.\r\n_Gomme-résine Ammoniaque_; G. _Ammoniak-gummiharz_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—Dorema Ammoniacum, Don, a perennial plant,[1229]\r\nwith a stout, erect, leafless flower-stem, 6 to 8 feet high, dividing\r\ntowards its upper part into numerous ascending branches, along\r\nwhich are disposed on thick short stalks, ball-like simple umbels,\r\nscarcely half an inch across, of very small flowers. The aspect of\r\nthe full-grown plant is therefore very unlike that of _Ferula_. The\r\n_Dorema_ has large compound leaves with broad lobes. The whole plant\r\nin its young state is covered with a tomentum of soft, stellate hairs,\r\nwhich give it a greyish look, but which disappear as it ripens its\r\nfruits. The withered stems long remain erect, and occurring in immense\r\nabundance and overtopping the other vegetation of the arid desert,\r\nhaving a striking appearance.[1230] The root is described in the\r\narticle on Sumbul, p. 313.\r\n\r\nThe plant occurs over a wide area of the barren regions of which Persia\r\nis the centre. According to Bunge and Bienert, its north-western limit\r\nappears to be Shahrud (S.E. of Asterabad), whence it extends eastwards\r\nto the deserts south of the Sea of Aral and the Sir-Daria. The most\r\nsouthern point at which the plant has been observed is Basiran, a\r\nvillage of Southern Khorassan in N. lat. 32°, E. long. 59°.\r\n\r\n[1229] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Medic.

(1865) 282.\r\n\r\nOf the three or four other species of _Dorema_, _D. Aucheri_\r\nBoiss.[1231] affords very good ammoniacum, as we know by an ample\r\nspecimen of the gum deposited together with the plant in the British\r\nMuseum by Mr. W. K. Loftus, who in 1751 collected both at Kirrind\r\nin Western Persia, where the plant is called in Kurdish _Zuh_.\r\nBoissier[1232] includes as _D. Aucheri_ another plant, called by Loftus\r\n_D. robustum_, the gum of which is certainly different from ammoniacum.\r\nOf the plant itself there are only _fruits_ in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n=History=—The first writer to mention ammoniacum is Dioscorides, who\r\nstates it to be the juice of a _Narthex_ growing about Cyrene in Libya,\r\nand that it is produced in the neighbourhood of the temple of Ammon.\r\nHe says it is of two sorts, the one like frankincense in pure, solid\r\ntears, the other massive, and contaminated with earthy impurities.\r\nPliny gives essentially the same account.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding Greek and Latin authors on medicine throw but little\r\nlight on the drug, which however is mentioned by most of them as used\r\nin fumigation. Hence we find such terms as _Ammoniacum thymiama_,[1233]\r\n_Ammoniacum suffimen_, _Thus Libycum_.\r\n\r\nThe African origin assigned to the drug by Dioscorides, has long\r\nperplexed pharmacologists; but it is now well ascertained that in\r\nMorocco a large species of _Ferula_ yields a gum-resin having some\r\nresemblance to ammoniacum, and still an object of traffic with\r\nEgypt and Arabia, where it is employed, like the ancient drug, _in\r\nfumigations_. There can be but little doubt we think, that the\r\nammoniacum of Morocco is identical with the ammoniacum of the ancients;\r\nit may well have been imported by way of Cyrene from regions lying\r\nfurther westward.[1234]\r\n\r\nPersian ammoniacum or the ammoniacum of European commerce may also have\r\nbeen known in very remote times, though we are unable to trace it back\r\nearlier than the 10th century, at which period it is mentioned by Isaac\r\nJudæus[1235] and by the Persian physician Alhervi.[1236] Both these\r\nwriters designate it _Ushak_, a name which it bears in Persia to the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n=Collection=—The stem of the plant abounds in a milky juice which flows\r\nout on the slightest puncture. The agent which occasions the exudation\r\nis a beetle, multitudes of which pierce the stem. The gum, the drops\r\nof which speedily harden, partly remains adherent to the stem and\r\npartly falls to the ground; it is gathered about the end of July by\r\nthe peasants, who sell it to dealers for conveyance to Ispahan or the\r\ncoast.[1237]\r\n\r\n[1231] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, part 4.\r\n\r\n[1232] _Flora Orientalis_, ii.

Trans._ xvi. (1833) 605.\r\n\r\nYoung roots 3 to 4 years old are, according to Borszczow, extremely\r\nrich in milky juice which sometimes exudes into the surrounding soil in\r\nlarge drops; there is also an exudation from the fibrous crown of the\r\nroot of a dark inferior sort of ammoniacum. The gum-resin appears to be\r\ncollected in quantity only in Persia. One of the chief localities for\r\nit are the desert plains about Yezdikhast, between Ispahan and Shiraz.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Ammoniacum occurs in dry grains or tears of roundish\r\nform, from the size of a small pea to that of a cherry, or in nodular\r\nlumps. They are externally of a pale creamy yellow, opaque and\r\nmilky-white within. By long keeping, the outer colour darkens to a\r\ncinnamon-brown. Ammoniacum is brittle, showing when broken a dull waxy\r\nlustre, but it easily softens with warmth. It has a bitter acrid taste,\r\nand a peculiar, characteristic, non-alliaceous odour. It readily forms\r\na white emulsion when triturated with water. It is coloured yellow by\r\ncaustic potash. Hypochlorites, as common bleaching powder, give it a\r\nbright orange hue, while they do not affect the Morocco drug.\r\n\r\nAmmoniacum is obtained from the mature plant, the ripe mericarps of\r\nwhich, ⅜ of an inch in length, are often found sticking to the tears.\r\nBy pressure the tears agglutinate into a compact mass, which is the\r\n_Lump Ammoniacum_ of the druggists. It is generally less pure than the\r\ndetached grains, and fetches a lower price.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Ammoniacum is a mixture of volatile oil with\r\nresin and gum. We obtained only ⅓ per cent. of oil which we find to\r\nbe dextrogyrate; we failed in obtaining terpin (see Galbanum, p. 322)\r\nfrom it. The oil has the precise odour of the drug, contains, according\r\nto our experiments, no sulphur; a similar observation was made by\r\nPrzeciszewski[1238]. Vigier[1239] asserts that it blackens silver, and\r\nthat after oxidation with nitric acid, he detected in it sulphuric\r\nacid. He states that, with hydrochloric acid, the oil acquires a fine\r\nviolet tint passing by all shades to black; we failed in obtaining this\r\ncoloration. By diluting the oil with bisulphide of carbon, and then\r\nadding mineral acids, we observed only yellow colorations. The oil\r\ndiluted with alcohol acquires a reddish hue by ferric chloride.\r\n\r\nThe resin ammoniacum usually amounts to about 70 per cent.\r\nPrzeciszewski asserts that the indifferent resin when heated yields\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. Our own experiments failed to show the presence\r\nof sulphur in the _crude_ drug; and the same negative result has been\r\nmore recently obtained in some careful experiments by Moss[1240]. Water\r\nwhen boiled with the resin acquires a yellow hue and slightly acid\r\nreaction; the liquid assumes an intense red coloration on addition of\r\nferric chloride.\r\n\r\nUnlike the gum-resin of allied plants, ammoniacum yields no\r\numbelliferone. When melted with caustic potash it affords a little\r\nresorcin.\r\n\r\nThe mucilaginous matter of the drug consists of a gum readily soluble\r\nin water and a smaller quantity of about ¼ of an insoluble part, no\r\ndoubt identical with that occurring in asafœtida and galbanum. The\r\naqueous solution of the gum of ammoniacum is very slightly levogyre.\r\n\r\n[1238] _Pharmakologische Untersuchungen über Ammoniacum, Sagapenum und\r\nOpopanax_, Dorpat, 1861.\r\n\r\n[1239] _Gommes-résines des Ombellifères_ (Thèse), Paris, 1869. 93.\r\n\r\n[1240] _Pharm. Journ._ March 29, 1873. 761.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Ammoniacum is shipped to Europe from the Persian Gulf by way\r\nof Bombay. The exports from the latter place in the year 1871-72 were\r\n453 cwt., all shipped to the United Kingdom. The quantity imported into\r\nBombay in 1872-73 was 1671 cwt., all from the Persian Gulf.[1241]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The drug is administered as an expectorant and is also used in\r\ncertain plasters.\r\n\r\nAllied Gum-resins.\r\n\r\n_African Ammoniacum._—This is according to Lindley[1242] the product of\r\n_Ferula tingitana_ L., a species growing over all northern Africa as\r\nfar as Syria, Rhodus and Chios. It is called _Kelth_ in Morocco, its\r\nproduct, _Fasay_, being shipped occasionally at Mazagan (el Bridja)\r\nor also at Mogador. This gum-resin is in large, compact, dark masses,\r\nformed of agglutinated tears having a whitish or pale greenish, or a\r\nfawn colour. But there are also seen very impure masses. The weak odour\r\nof the Moroccan drug is not suggestive of true ammoniacum. Moss (1873)\r\nfound in a specimen of the former 9 per cent. of gum and 67 per cent.\r\nof resin. It yielded umbelliferone to Hirschsohn (1875), and by melting\r\nit with potash Goldschmiedt (1878) obtained Resorcin and a peculiar\r\nacid, C₁₀H₁₀O₆, which he failed to obtain from true ammoniacum.\r\n\r\n_Opopanax_—A gum-resin occurring in hard, nodular, brittle,\r\nearthy-looking lumps of a bright orange-brown hue, and penetrating\r\noffensive odour, reminding one of crushed ivy-leaves. It is commonly\r\nattributed to _Opopanax Chironium_ Koch, a native of Mediterranean\r\nEurope. We have never seen a specimen known to have been obtained\r\nfrom this plant; but can say that the gum-resin of the nearly\r\nallied _Opopanax persicum_ Boiss., as collected by Loftus at\r\nKirrind in Western Persia in 1851, has neither the appearance nor\r\nthe characteristic odour of officinal opopanax. Powell,[1243] who\r\nendeavoured to trace the origin of the drug, regards it as a product of\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\nOpopanax was very common in old pharmacy, but has fallen out of use,\r\nand is now both rare and expensive.[1244]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS ANETHI.\r\n\r\n_Semen Anethi_; _Dill Fruits_, _Dill Seeds_; F. _Fruits d’Aneth_; G.\r\n_Dillfrüchte_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Anethum graveolens_ L., (_Peucedanum[1245]\r\ngraveolens_ Hiern) an erect, glaucous annual plant, with finely\r\nstriated stems, usually to 1 to 1½ feet high, pinnate leaves with\r\nsetaceous linear segments, and yellow flowers.\r\n\r\n[1241] _Statement of the Trade and Navigation of the Presidency of\r\nBombay_, 1871-72, and 1872-73.\r\n\r\n[1242] As stated by Pereira, _Mat.

(1868) 402.\r\n\r\n[1244] Further particulars regarding Opopanax and Sagapenum, may be\r\nfound in the theses of Przeciszewski (1861) and Vigier (1869), noticed\r\nin our article on Ammoniacum, and Dragendorff’s _Jahresbericht_, 1875.\r\n119. 120.\r\n\r\n[1245] Bentham and Hooker (_Gen. Plant._ 919) suppress the genus\r\n_Anethum_, uniting its one solitary species with _Peucedanum_.\r\n\r\nIt is indigenous to the Mediterranean region, Southern Russia and the\r\nCaucasian provinces, but is found as a cornfield weed in many other\r\ncountries, and is frequently cultivated in gardens. It succeeds in\r\nNorway as far north as Throndhjem.\r\n\r\nDill, under the Hindustani name of _Suvā_ or _Sōyah_, is largely grown\r\nin various ports of India, where the plant though of but a few months’\r\nduration, grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet. On account of a slight\r\npeculiarity in the fruit, the Indian plant was regarded by Roxburgh and\r\nDe Candolle as a distinct species, and called _Anethum Sowa_, but it\r\npossesses no botanical characters to warrant its separation from _A.\r\ngraveolens_.\r\n\r\n=History=—Dill is commonly regarded to be the Ἄνηθον of Dioscorides,\r\nthe _Anethum_ of Palladius and other ancient writers, as well as of\r\nthe New Testament.[1246] In Greece the name Ἄνηθον is at present\r\napplied[1247] to a plant of very similar appearance, _Carum Ridolfia_\r\nBenth. et Hook (_Anethum segetum_ L.). By the later Greeks, the term\r\nἌνηθον was also used for dill.[1248]\r\n\r\nDill, as well as coriander, fennel, cumin, and ammi, was in frequent\r\nrequisition in Britain in Anglo-Saxon times.[1249] The name is derived\r\naccording to Prior[1250] from the old Norse word _dilla_, to _lull_,\r\nin allusion to the reputed carminative properties of the drug. However\r\nthis may be, we find the word occurring in the 10th century in the\r\nVocabulary of Alfric, archbishop of Canterbury.[1251] The words _dill_\r\nand _till_, undoubtedly meaning this drug, were also used in Germany\r\nand Switzerland as early as A.D. 1000.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit, which has the characters usual to\r\n_Umbelliferæ_, is of ovoid form, much compressed dorsally, surrounded\r\nwith a broad flattened margin. The mericarps about ⅒ of an inch wide,\r\nare mostly separate; they are provided with 5 equidistant, filiform\r\nridges, of which the two lateral lose themselves in the paler, broad,\r\nthin margin. The three others are sharply keeled; the darkest space\r\nbetween them is occupied by a vitta and two occur on the commissure.\r\nIn the Indian drug, the mericarps are narrower and more convex, the\r\nridges more distinct and pale, and the border less winged. In other\r\nrespects it accords with that of Europe. The odour and taste of dill\r\nare agreeably aromatic.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Characters=—The pericarp is formed of a small number of\r\nflattened cells, which in the inner layer are of a brown colour; the\r\nridges consist as usual of a strong fibro-vascular bundle. The vittæ\r\nin a transverse section present an elliptic outline ¹/₁₄₀ of an inch\r\nor less in diameter. The margin of the mericarp is built up of porous,\r\nparenchymatous tissue. The albumen as in the seeds of all umbellifers,\r\nconsists of thick-walled, angular cells, loaded with fatty oil, and\r\nglobular grains of albuminous matters which present a dark cross when\r\nexamined by polarized light.\r\n\r\n[1246] Matt. xxiii. 23,—where it has been rendered _anise_ by the\r\nEnglish translators from Wicklif (1380) downwards. But in other\r\nversions, the word is correctly translated.\r\n\r\n[1247] Heldreich, _Nutzpflanzen Griechenlands_ (1862) 40.\r\n\r\n[1248] Langkavel, _Botanik d. späteren Griechen_, Berlin, 1866. 39.\r\n\r\n[1249] _Leechdoms_, &c., edited by Cockayne, 1864-66,—see especially\r\n_Herbarium Apuleii_, dating about A.D. 1050, in vol. i. pp. 219. 235.\r\n237. 281. 293.\r\n\r\n[1250] _Popular Names of British Plants_, 1870.\r\n\r\n[1251] _Volume of Vocabularies_, edited by Wright, 1857. 30.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Dill fruit yields from 3 to 4 per cent. of an\r\nessential oil, the largest proportion of which was found by Gladstone\r\n(1864-1872) to be a hydrocarbon, C₁₀H₁₆, to which he gave the name\r\n_Anethene_. This substance has a lemon-like odour, sp. gr. ·846, and\r\nboils at 172° C. It deviates a ray of polarized light strongly to the\r\nright. Nietzki (1874) ascertained that there is, moreover, present\r\nanother hydrocarbon, C₁₀H₁₆, in a very small proportion, which boils\r\nat 155-160°. A third constituent of oil of dill is in all probability\r\nidentical with carvol (see page 307); we prepared from the former\r\nimmediately the crystals (C₁₀H₁₄O)₂SH₂.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The distilled water of dill is stomachic and carminative, and\r\nfrequently prescribed as a vehicle for more active medicines. The seeds\r\nare much used for culinary and medicinal purposes by the people of\r\nIndia, but are little employed in Continental Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS CORIANDRI.\r\n\r\n_Semen Coriandri_; _Coriander Fruits_, _Coriander Seeds_, _Corianders_;\r\nF. _Fruits de Coriandre_; G. _Koriander_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Coriandrum sativum_ L., a small glabrous, annual\r\nplant, apparently indigenous to the Mediterranean and Caucasian\r\nregions, not known growing wild, but now found as a cornfield weed\r\nthroughout the temperate parts of the Old World. It is cultivated in\r\nmany countries, and has thus found its way even to Paraguay. In England\r\nthe cultivation of coriander has long been carried on, but only to a\r\nvery limited extent.\r\n\r\n=History=—Coriander appears to occur in the famous Egyptian papyrus\r\nEbers; it is also mentioned, under the name of Kustumburu, in early\r\nSanskrit authors, and is also met with in the Scriptures.[1252]\r\n\r\nThe plant owes its names Κόριον, Κορίαννον, and Κοριάνδρον, or also\r\nin the middle ages, Κλάνδρον, to the offensive odour it exhales when\r\nhandled, and which reminds one of bugs,—in Greek Κόρις. This character\r\ncaused it to be regarded in the middle ages as having poisonous\r\nproperties.[1253] The ripe fruits which are entirely free from the\r\nfœtid smell of the growing plant, were used as a spice by the Jews\r\nand the Romans, and in medicine from a very early period. Cato, who\r\nwrote on agriculture in the 3rd century B.C., notices the cultivation\r\nof coriander. Pliny states that the best is that of Egypt. It is of\r\nfrequent occurrence in the book “De opsoniis et condimentis” of Apicius\r\nCœlius, about the 3rd century of our era. Coriander is also included in\r\nthe list of Charlemagne, alluded to pages 92, 98, etc.\r\n\r\nCoriander was well known in Britain prior to the Norman Conquest, and\r\noften employed in ancient Welsh and English medicine and cookery.\r\n\r\n[1252] Exod. xvi. 31; Num. xi. 7.\r\n\r\n[1253] Petrus de Abbano, _Tract. de Venenis_, Venetiis, 1473. capp. 25.\r\n46.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation=—Coriander, called by the farmers _Col_, is cultivated in\r\nthe eastern counties of England, especially in Essex. It is sometimes\r\nsown with caraway, and being an annual is gathered and harvested the\r\nfirst year, the caraway remaining in the ground. The seedling plants\r\nare hoed so as to leave those that are to remain in rows 10 to 12\r\ninches apart. The plant is cut with sickles, and when dry the seed is\r\nthrashed out on a cloth in the centre of the field. On the best land,\r\n15 cwt. per acre is reckoned an average crop.[1254]\r\n\r\n[1254] R. Baker, in Morton’s _Cyclopædia of Agriculture_, i. (1855) 545.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit of coriander consists of a pair of\r\nhemispherical mericarps, firmly joined so as to form an almost regular\r\nglobe, measuring on an average about ⅕ of an inch in diameter, crowned\r\nby the stylopodium and calycinal teeth, and sometimes by the slender\r\ndiverging styles. The pericarp bears on each half, 4 perfectly straight\r\nsharpish ridges, regarded as secondary (_juga secundaria_); two other\r\nridges, often of darker colour, belonging to the mericarps in common,\r\nthe separation of which takes place in a rather sinuous line. The\r\nshallow depression between each pair of these straight ridges is\r\noccupied by a zigzag raised line (_jugum primarium_), of which there\r\nare therefore 5 in each mericarp. It will thus be seen that each\r\nmericarp has 5 (zigzag) so-called _primary ridges_, and 4 (keeled and\r\nmore prominent) _secondary_, besides the lateral ridges which mark the\r\nsuture or line of separation. There are no vittæ on the outer surface\r\nof the pericarp. Of the 5 teeth of the calyx, 2 often grow into long,\r\npointed, persistent lobes; they proceed from the outer flowers of the\r\numbel.\r\n\r\nThough the two mericarps are closely united, they adhere only by the\r\nthin pericarp, enclosing when ripe a lenticular cavity. On each side\r\nof this cavity, the skin of the fruit separates from that of the seed,\r\ndisplaying the two brown vittæ of each mericarp. In transverse section,\r\nthe albumen appears crescent-shaped, the concave side being towards the\r\ncavity. The carpophore stands in the middle of the latter as a column,\r\nconnected with the pericarp only at top and bottom.\r\n\r\nCorianders are smooth and rather hard, in colour buff or light brown.\r\nThey have a very mild aromatic taste, and, when crushed, a peculiar\r\nfragrant smell. When unripe, their odour, like that of the fresh plant,\r\nis offensive. The nature of the chemical change that occasions this\r\nalteration in odour has not been made out.\r\n\r\nThe Indian corianders shipped from Bombay are of large size and of\r\nelongated form.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The structural peculiarities of coriander fruit\r\nchiefly refer to the pericarp. Its middle layer is made up of thick\r\nwalled ligneous prosenchyme, traversed by a few fibro-vascular bundles\r\nwhich in the zigzag ridges vary exceedingly in position.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The essential oil of coriander has a composition\r\nindicated by the formula C₁₀H₁₈O, and is therefore isomeric with\r\nborneol. If the elements of water are abstracted by phosphoric\r\nanhydride, it is converted, according to Kawalier (1852), into an oil\r\nof offensive odour, C₁₀H₁₆.\r\n\r\nThe fruits yield of volatile oil from 0·7 to 1·1 per cent.; as the\r\nvittæ are well protected by the woody pericarp, corianders should be\r\nbruised before being submitted to distillation. Trommsdorff (1835)\r\nfound the fruits to afford 13 per cent. of fixed oil.\r\n\r\nThe fresh herb distilled in July when the fruits were far from ripe,\r\nyielded to one of us (F.) from 0·57 to 1·1 per mille of an essential\r\noil possessing in a high degree the disagreeable odour already alluded\r\nto. This oil was found to deviate the ray of polarized light 1·1° to\r\nthe right when examined in a column 50 mm. long. The oil distilled by\r\nus from ripe commercial fruit deviated 5·1° to the right.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—Coriander is cultivated in various parts\r\nof Continental Europe, and, as already stated, to a small extent in\r\nEngland. It is also produced in Northern Africa and in India. In\r\n1872-73, the export of coriander from the province of Sind[1255]\r\nwas 948 cwt.; from Bombay[1256] in the same year 619 cwt. From\r\nCalcutta[1257] there were shipped in 1870-71, 16,347 cwt.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Coriander fruits are reputed stimulant and carminative, yet are\r\nbut little employed in medicine. They are however used in veterinary\r\npractice, and by the distillers of gin, also in some countries in\r\ncookery.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS CUMINI.\r\n\r\n    _Fructus vel Semen Cymini_; _Cumin or\r\n        Cummin[1258] Fruits_, _Cummin Seeds_; F.\r\n        _Graines de Cumin_; G. _Mutterkümmel_,\r\n        _Kreuzkümmel_, _Langer oder Römischer\r\n        Kümmel_, _Mohrenkümmel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin.=—_Cuminum Cyminum_ L., a small annual plant,\r\nindigenous to the upper regions of the Nile, but carried at an early\r\nperiod by cultivation to Arabia, India and China, as well as to the\r\ncountries bordering the Mediterranean. The fruits of the plant ripen\r\nas far north as Southern Norway; but in Europe, Sicily and Malta alone\r\nproduce them in quantity.\r\n\r\n=History=—Cumin was well known to the ancients; it is alluded to by\r\nthe Hebrew prophet Isaiah,[1259] and is mentioned in the gospel of\r\nMatthew[1260] as one of the minor titheable productions of the Holy\r\nLand. Under the name Κύμινον, it is commended for its agreeable taste\r\nby Dioscorides, in whose day it was produced on the coasts of Asia\r\nMinor and Southern Italy. It is named as _Cuminum_ by Horace and\r\nPersius; Scribonius Largus, in the first century of our era, mentions\r\nCuminum æthiopicum, silvaticum and thebaicum.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle ages, cumin was one of the spices in most common\r\nuse. Thus in A.D. 716, an annual provision of 150 lb. of cumin for\r\nthe monastery of Corbie in Normandy, was not thought too large a\r\nsupply.[1261] Edrisi mentioned cumin as a product of Morocco (see\r\narticle Fructus Carui, p. 305), Algeria and Tunisia. It was in frequent\r\nuse in England, its average price between 1264 and 1400 being a little\r\nover 2_d._ per lb.[1262] Cumin is enumerated in the _Liber albus_[1263]\r\nof the city of London, compiled in 1419, among the merchandize on which\r\nthe king levied the impost called _scavage._ It is mentioned[1264]\r\nin 1453 as one of the articles of which the Grocers’ Company had the\r\nweighing and oversight, and was classed in 1484 in the same way in the\r\nGerman warehouse in Venice.[1265]\r\n\r\n[1255] _Statement of the Trade and Navigation of Sind for the year\r\n1872-73_, Karachi, 1873. 36.\r\n\r\n[1256] Ditto for Bombay, 1872-73. ii. 90.\r\n\r\n[1257] _Annual Volume of Trade, etc. for the Bengal Presidency_,\r\n1870-71. 121.\r\n\r\n[1258] _Comyne_ in Wicklif’s Bible (1380), _Commen_ in Tyndale’s\r\n(1534), _Commyn_ in Cranmer’s (1539), _Cummine_ in the Authorised\r\nVersion (1611), _Cumin_ in Gerarde’s _Herbal_ (1636) and Paris’s\r\n_Pharmacologia_ (1822), _Cummin_, Ray (1693) and in modern trade-lists\r\nand price-currents.\r\n\r\n[1259] Ch. xxviii. 25-27.\r\n\r\n[1260] Ch. xxiii. 23.\r\n\r\n[1261] Pardessus, _Diplomata_, etc., Paris, 1849. ii. 309.\r\n\r\n[1262] Rogers, _Hist. of Agriculture and Prices in England_, 1876. i.\r\n631, ii. 543-547.\r\n\r\n[1263] _Munimenta Gildhallæ Londoniensis_, edited by Riley, i.

The mericarps,\r\nwhich do not readily separate from the carpophore, are about ¼ of\r\nan inch in length and ⅒ of an inch in greatest breadth. Each has 5\r\nprimary ridges which are filiform, and scabrous or muriculate, and 4\r\nsecondary covered with rough hairs. Between the primary ridges is a\r\nsingle elongated vitta, and 2 vittæ occur on the commissural surface.\r\nA transverse section of the seed shows a reniform outline. There is a\r\nform of _C. Cyminum_ in cultivation, the fruit of which is perfectly\r\nglabrous.\r\n\r\nCumin has a strong aromatic taste and smell, far less agreeable than\r\nthat of caraway.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The hairs are rather brittle, sometimes ½ mm.\r\nin length, formed of cells springing from the epidermis. The larger\r\nconsists of groups of cells, vertically or laterally combined, and\r\nenclosed by a common envelope; the smaller of but a single cell ending\r\nin a rounded point. The whole pericarp is rich in tannic matter,\r\nstriking with salts of iron a dark greenish colour.\r\n\r\nThe tissue of the seed is loaded with colourless drops of a fatty oil;\r\nthe vittæ with a yellowish-brown essential oil. But the most striking\r\ncontents of the parenchyme of the albumen consist of transparent,\r\ncolourless, spherical grains, 7 to 5 mkm. in diameter, several of which\r\nare enclosed in each cell. Under a high magnifying power, they show a\r\ncentral cavity with a series of concentric layers around it, frequently\r\ntraversed by radial clefts. Examined in polarized light, these grains\r\ndisplay exactly the same cross as is seen in granules of starch,\r\nalthough their behaviour with chemical tests at once proves that they\r\nare by no means that substance; in fact iodine does not render them\r\nblue, but intensely brown. Grains of the same character, assuming\r\nsometimes a crystalloid form, occur in most umbelliferous fruits,\r\nand in many seeds of other orders. All these bodies are composed of\r\nalbuminous and fatty matters; the more crystalloid form as met with in\r\nthe seeds of _Ricinus_ and in the fruit of parsley, is the body called\r\nby Hartig _Aleuron_.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Cumin fruits yielded to Bley (1829) 7 per cent.\r\nof fat oil, 13 per cent. of resin (?), 8 of mucilage and gum, 15 of\r\nalbuminous matter, and a large amount of malates. Their peculiar,\r\nstrong, aromatic smell and taste, depend on the essential oil of which\r\nthey afford as much as 4 per cent. It contains about 56 per cent. of\r\n\r\n    _Cuminol_ (or _Cuminaldehyde_), C₆H₄ {CHO,\r\n                                         {C₃H₇\r\n\r\na liquid of sp. gr. 0·972, boiling point 237° C. It has also been met\r\nwith, in 1858, by Trapp in the oil of Cicuta virosa. By boiling cuminol\r\nwith potash in alcoholic solution,\r\n\r\n    cuminalcohol, C₆H₄ {CH₂OH,\r\n                       {C₃H₇\r\n\r\nas well as the potassium salt of cuminic acid,\r\n\r\n         {COOH\r\n    C₆H₄ {        , are formed.\r\n         {C₃H₇\r\n\r\nThe oil of cumin, secondly, contains a mixture of hydrocarbons. That\r\nwhich constitutes about one-half of the crude oil has been first\r\nobtained in 1841 by Gerhardt and Cahours, just from the oil under\r\nnotice, and therefore called _Cymene_ (or also _Cymol_). It is a liquid\r\nof 0·873 sp. gr. at 0° (32° F.), boiling at 175°; neither cymene nor\r\ncuminol have the same odour and taste as the crude oil. Many other\r\nplants have been noticed as containing cymene among the constituents\r\nof their essential oils. Thus for instance _Cicuta virosa_ L.,\r\n_Carum Ajowan_ (page 304), _Thymus vulgaris_ (see art. Folia Thymi),\r\n_Eucalyptus globulus_ Labill.\r\n\r\n    Cymene, C₆H₄ {CH₃ (Propylmethyl-benzol),\r\n                 {C₃H₇\r\n\r\nmay also be artificially obtained from a large number of essential oils\r\nhaving the composition C₁₀H₁₆, or C₁₀H₁₄O, or C₁₀H₁₆O, or C₁₀H₁₈O. It\r\ndiffers very remarkably from the oils of the formula C₁₀H₁₆, inasmuch\r\nas cymene yields the crystallizable cymen-sulphonic acids when it is\r\nwarmed with concentrated sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is present in the oil of cumin a small amount of a\r\nterpene, C₁₀H₁₆, boiling at 155·8° C., as stated in 1865 by C. M.\r\nWarren, and in 1873 by Beilstein and Kupffer.\r\n\r\nThe dextrogyrate power of cuminol is a little less strong than that of\r\ncymene; artificial cymene is optically inert.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Cumin is shipped to England from Mogador, Malta and Sicily.\r\nIn Malta there were in 1863, 140 acres under cultivation with this\r\ncrop; in 1865, 730 acres, producing 2766 cwt.[1266]\r\n\r\nThe export of cumin from Morocco[1267] in 1872 was 1657 cwt.; that from\r\nBombay in the year 1872-73 was 6766 cwt.;[1268] and 20,040 cwt. from\r\nCalcutta[1269] in the year 1870-71.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Cumin is sold by druggists as an ingredient of curry powders,\r\nbut to a much larger extent for use in veterinary medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPRIFOLIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORES SAMBUCI.\r\n\r\n_Elder Flowers_; F. _Fleurs de Sureau_; G. _Holunderblüthe_,\r\n_Fliederblumen_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Sambucus nigra_ L.—a large deciduous shrub or\r\nsmall tree, indigenous to Southern and Central Europe (not in Russia),\r\nWestern Asia, the Crimea, the regions of the Caucasus and Southern\r\nSiberia. It is believed to be a native of England and Ireland, but not\r\nto be truly wild in Scotland. In other northern parts of Europe, as\r\nNorway and Sweden, the elder appears only as a plant introduced there\r\nduring the middle ages by the monks.[1270]\r\n\r\n[1266] _Statistical Tables relating to the Colonial and other\r\npossessions of the United Kingdom_, xi. 618. 619.\r\n\r\n[1267] _Consular Reports_, Aug. 1873, 917; in 1876 only 380 cwt.\r\n\r\n[1268] _Statement of the Trade and Navigation of the Presidency of\r\nBombay for 1872-73._ pt. ii. 90.\r\n\r\n[1269] _Annual Volume of Trade, etc. for the Bengal Presidency for\r\n1870-71._ 121.\r\n\r\n[1270] Schübeler, _Pflanzenwelt Norwegens_ (1873-75) 253.\r\n\r\n=History=—The Romans, as we learn from Pliny, made use in medicine of\r\nthe plant under notice as well as of the _Dwarf Elder_ (_S. Ebulus_\r\nL.) Both kinds were employed in Britain by the ancient English[1271]\r\nand Welsh[1272] leeches, and in Italy in the medicine of the school of\r\nSalernum.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The elder produces in the early summer, conspicuous,\r\nmany-flowered cymes, 4 to 5 inches in diameter, of which the long\r\npeduncle divides into 5 branches, which subdivide once or several\r\ntimes by threes or fives, ultimately separating by repeated forking\r\ninto slender, furrowed pedicels about ¼ of an inch long, each bearing\r\na single flower. In the second or third furcations, the middle flower\r\nremains short-stalked or sessile, and opens sooner than the rest. In\r\nlike manner, on the outermost small forks only one of the florets is\r\nusually long-stalked. The whole of this inflorescence forms a flattish\r\numbelliform cyme, perfectly glabrous and destitute of bracts.\r\n\r\nThe calyx is combined with the ovary and bordered with 4 or 5 small\r\nteeth. The corolla, which is of a creamy white, is monopetalous with\r\na very short tube and 5 spreading ovate lobes. The stamens which are\r\nabout as long as the divisions of the corolla and alternate with\r\nthem, are inserted in the tube of the latter. The yellow pollen which\r\nthickly powders the flowers, appears under the microscope 3-pored. The\r\nprojecting ovary is crowned by a 2-or 3-lobed sessile stigma.\r\n\r\nFor use in pharmacy, the part of the flower most desirable is the\r\ncorolla, to obtain a good proportion of which the gathered cymes are\r\nleft for a few hours in a large heap; the mass slightly heats, the\r\ncorollas detach themselves, and are separated from the green stalks by\r\nshaking, rubbing, and sifting; they require to be then rapidly dried.\r\nThis done, they become much shrivelled and assume a dull yellow tint.\r\nWhen fresh, they have a sweet faint smell, which becomes stronger and\r\nsomewhat different by drying, and is quite unlike the repulsive odour\r\nof the fresh leaves and bark. Dried elder flowers have a bitterish,\r\nslightly gummy flavour. On the Continent they are sold with the stalks,\r\n_i.e._ in entire cymes.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Elder flowers yield a very small percentage of a\r\nbutter-like essential oil, lighter than water, and smelling strongly of\r\nthe flowers; it is easily altered by exposure to the air.[1273] The oil\r\nis accompanied by traces of volatile acids.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Elder flowers are only employed in British medicine for making\r\nan aromatic distilled water, and for communicating a pleasant odour\r\nto lard (_Unguentum Sambuci_). The flowers of _Sambucus canadensis_\r\nL.[1274] indigenous in the United States, which are extremely similar\r\nto those of our species, appear to be more fragrant. The _leaves_ of\r\nthe latter are sometimes used for giving a fine green tint to oil or\r\nfat, as in the _Oleum viride_ and _Unguentum Sambuci foliorum_ of the\r\nshops. The bark, once much employed, is now obsolete.\r\n\r\n[1271] _Leechdoms, etc. of Early England_ edited by Cockayne, iii.\r\n(1866) 324. 347. According to the Rev.

(_Nauclea Gambir_ Hunter)\r\na stout climbing shrub, supporting itself by means of its flower-stalks\r\nwhich are developed into strong recurved hooks.[1275] It is a native of\r\nthe countries bordering the Straits of Malacca, and especially of the\r\nnumerous islands at their eastern end; but according to Crawfurd[1276]\r\nit does not seem indigenous to any of the islands of the volcanic band.\r\nIt also grows in Ceylon, where however no use is made of it.\r\n\r\n2. _U. acida_ Roxb.,[1277] probably a mere variety of the preceding,\r\nand growing in the Malayan islands, appears to be used in exactly the\r\nsame manner.\r\n\r\n=History=—Gambier is one of the substances to which the name of\r\n_Catechu_ or _Terra Japonica_ is often applied; the other is\r\n_Cutch_, which has been already described (p. 243). By druggists and\r\npharmaceutists the two articles are frequently confounded, but in the\r\ngreat world of commerce they are reckoned as quite distinct. In many\r\nprice-currents and trade-lists, _Catechu_ is not found under that name,\r\nbut only appears under the terms _Cutch_ and _Gambier_.\r\n\r\nCrawfurd asserts that gambier has been exported from time immemorial\r\nto Java from the Malacca Straits. This statement appears highly\r\nquestionable. Rumphius, who resided in Amboyna during the second half\r\nof the 17th century, was a merchant, consul and naturalist; and in\r\nthese capacities became thoroughly conversant with the products of the\r\nMalay Archipelago and adjacent regions, as the six folio volumes of his\r\n_Herbarium Amboinense_, illustrated by 587 plates, amply prove.\r\n\r\nAmong other plants, he figures[1278] _Uncaria Gambier_, which he terms\r\n_Funis uncatus_, and states to exist under two varieties, the one with\r\nbroad, and the other with narrow leaves. The first form, he says, is\r\ncalled in Malay _Daun Gatta Gambir_, on account of the bitter taste\r\nof its leaves, which is perceptible in the lozenges (_trochisci_)\r\ncalled _Gatta Gambir_, so much so that one might suppose they were made\r\nfrom these leaves, which however is not the case. He further asserts\r\nthat the leaves have a detergent, drying quality by reason of their\r\nbitterness, which is nevertheless not intense but quite bearable in\r\nthe mouth: that they are masticated instead of _Pinang_ [Betel-nut]\r\nwith _Siri_ [leaf of _Piper Betle_] and lime: that the people of Java\r\nand Bali plant the first variety near their houses for the sake of its\r\nfragrant flowers; but though they chew its leaves instead of _Pinang_,\r\nit must not be supposed that it is this plant from which the lozenges\r\n_Gatta_ are compounded, for that indeed is quite different.\r\n\r\n[1275] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med. Plants_, part 7 (1876).\r\n\r\n[1276] _Dictionary of the Indian Islands_, 1865. 142.\r\n\r\n[1277] Beautifully figured in Berg und Schmidt, _Offizinelle Gewächse_,\r\nxxx. c. 1863.\r\n\r\n[1278] _Herb. Amb._ v. 63. tab. 34.\r\n\r\nThus, if we may credit Rumphius, it would seem that the important\r\nmanufacture of gambier had no existence at the commencement of the last\r\ncentury. As to “_Gatta Gambir_,” his statements are scarcely in accord\r\nwith those of more recent writers. We may however remark that that name\r\nis very like the Tamil _Katta Kāmbu_, signifying _Catechu_, which drug\r\nis sometimes made into little round cakes, and was certainly a large\r\nexport from India to Malacca and China as early as the 16th century (p.\r\n241).\r\n\r\nThat gambier was unknown to Europeans long after the time of Rumphius,\r\nis evident from other facts. Stevens, a merchant of Bombay, in his\r\n_Compleat Guide to the East India Trade_, published in 1766, quotes the\r\nprices of goods at Malacca, but makes no allusion to gambier. Nor is\r\nthere any reference to it in Savary’s _Dictionnaire de Commerce_ (ed.\r\nof 1750), in which Malacca is mentioned as the great entrepôt of the\r\ntrade of India with that of China and Japan.\r\n\r\nThe first account of gambier known to us, was communicated to the\r\nBatavian Society of Arts and Sciences in 1780, by a Dutch trader named\r\nCouperus. This person narrates[1279] how the plant was introduced into\r\nMalacca from Pontjan in 1758, and how gambier is made from its leaves;\r\nand names several sorts of the drug and their prices.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, a description of “the drug called _Gutta Gambeer_,” and of\r\nthe tree from which it is made, was presented to the Linnean Society\r\nof London.[1280] The writer, William Hunter, well known for scientific\r\nobservations in connection with India, states that the substance is\r\nmade chiefly at Malacca, Siak and Rhio, that it is in the form of small\r\nsquares, or little round cakes almost perfectly white, and that the\r\nfiner sorts are used for chewing with betel leaf in the same manner as\r\ncatechu, while the coarser are shipped to Batavia and China for use in\r\ntanning and dyeing.\r\n\r\n=Manufacture=—The gambier plant is cultivated in plantations. These\r\nwere commenced in 1819 in Singapore, where there were at one time\r\n800 plantations; but owing to scarcity of fuel, without an abundant\r\nsupply of which the manufacture is impossible, and dearness of labour,\r\ngambier-planting was in 1866 fast disappearing from the island.[1281]\r\nThe official Blue Book, printed at Singapore in 1872, reports it as\r\n“_much increased_.” It is largely pursued on the mainland (Johore),\r\nand in the islands of the Rhio-Lingga Archipelago, lying south-east of\r\nSingapore. On the island of Bintang, the most northerly of the group,\r\nthere were about 1,250 gambier-plantations in 1854.\r\n\r\nThe plantations are often formed in clearings of the jungle, where\r\nthey last for a few years and are then abandoned,[1282] owing to\r\nthe impoverishment of the soil and the irrepressible growth of the\r\n_lalang_ grass (_Imperata Königii_ P. de B.), which is more difficult\r\nto eradicate than even primæval jungle. It has been found profitable to\r\ncombine with the cultivation of gambier that of pepper, for which the\r\nboiled leaves of the gambier form an excellent manure.\r\n\r\n[1279] _Verhandelingen van het Bataviaasch Genootschap_, ii. (derde\r\ndruk) 217-234.\r\n\r\n[1280] _Linn. Trans._ ix. (1808) 218-224.\r\n\r\n[1281] Collingwood, _Journ. of Linn. Soc._, Bot., x. (1869) 52.\r\n\r\n[1282] This abuse of land has been repressed in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe gambier plants are allowed to grow 8 to 10 feet high, and as their\r\nfoliage is always in season, each plant is stripped 3 or 4 times in\r\nthe year. The apparatus and all that belongs to the manufacture of\r\nthe extract are of the most primitive description.[1283] A shallow\r\ncast-iron pan about 3 feet across is built into an earthen fireplace.\r\nWater is poured into the pan, a fire is kindled, and the leaves and\r\nyoung shoots, freshly plucked, are scattered in, and boiled for about\r\nan hour. At the end of this time they are thrown on to a capacious\r\nsloping trough, the lower end of which projects into the pan, and\r\nsqueezed with the hand so that the absorbed liquor may run back into\r\nthe boiler. The decoction is then evaporated to the consistence of\r\na thin syrup, and baled out into buckets. When sufficiently cool it\r\nis subjected to a curious treatment:—instead of simply stirring it\r\nround, the workman pushes a stick of soft wood in a sloping direction\r\ninto each bucket; and placing two such buckets before him, he works a\r\nstick up and down in each. The liquid thickens round the stick, and\r\nthe thickened portion being constantly rubbed off, while at the same\r\nthe whole is in motion, it gradually sets into a mass, a result which\r\nthe workman affirms would never be produced by simple stirring round.\r\nThough we are not prepared to concur in the workman’s opinion, it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that his manner of treating the liquor favours\r\nthe crystallization of the catechin in a more concrete form than it\r\nmight otherwise assume. The thickened mass, which is said by another\r\nwriter to resemble soft yellowish clay, is now placed in shallow square\r\nboxes, and when somewhat hardened is cut into cubes and dried in the\r\nshade. The leaves are boiled a second time, and finally washed in\r\nwater, which water is saved for another operation.\r\n\r\nFrom informations obtained in 1878 it would appear that now the\r\nprevailing part of gambier is made by means of pressure into blocks.\r\n\r\nA plantation with five labourers contains on an average 70,000 to\r\n80,000 shrubs, and yields 40 to 50 catties (1 catty = 1⅓ lb. = 604·8\r\ngrammes) of gambier daily.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Gambier is an earthy-looking substance of light brown\r\nhue, consisting of cubes about an inch each side, more or less\r\nagglutinated, or it is in the form of entirely compact masses. The\r\ncubes are externally of a reddish-brown and compact, internally of a\r\npale cinnamon hue, dry, porous, friable, devoid of odour, but with a\r\nbitterish astringent taste, becoming subsequently sweetish. Under the\r\nmicroscope, the cubes of gambier are seen to consist of very small\r\nacicular crystals.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—In a chemical point of view, gambier agrees with\r\ncutch, especially with the pale variety made in Northern India (p.\r\n242). Both substances consist mainly of _Catechin_,[1284] which may\r\nbe obtained in the hydrated state as slender colourless needles, by\r\nexhausting gambier with cold water, and crystallizing the residue from\r\n3 or 4 parts of hot water, which on cooling deposits nearly all the\r\ncatechin. Ferric chloride strikes with the solution of catechin, even\r\nwhen much diluted, a green tint. If it is shaken with ferrous sulphate\r\nand an extremely small quantity of bicarbonate of sodium, a violet\r\ncolour makes its appearance. The same reactions are produced by various\r\nsubstances of the tannic class.\r\n\r\n[1283] We borrow the following account, which is the best we have met\r\nwith, from Jagor’s _Singapore, Malacca, und Java_, Berlin, 1866. 64.\r\n\r\n[1284] Gautier (1877) suggests that it is not identical with catechin\r\nfrom Acacia Catechin (p. 244).\r\n\r\nThe yellowish colouring matter of gambier was determined by Hlasiwetz\r\n(1867) and Löwe (1873) to be _Quercetin_, which is also a constituent\r\nof cutch. Quercetin is but very sparingly soluble in water, yet it is\r\nnevertheless found, in small quantity, in the aqueous extract of cutch,\r\nfrom which it may be removed by means of ether. As many species of\r\n_Nauclea_ contain, according to De Vry,[1285] _Quinovic Acid_, it is\r\nprobable that that substance may be detected in gambier.\r\n\r\nSome fine gambier in regular cubes which we incinerated left 2·6 per\r\ncent. of ash, consisting mainly of carbonates of calcium and magnesium.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Singapore, which is the great emporium for gambier, exported\r\nin 1871 no less than 34,248 tons, of which quantity 19,550 tons had\r\nbeen imported into the colony chiefly from Rhio and the Malayan\r\nPeninsula.[1286] In 1876 the export had increased to more than 50,000\r\ntons of pressed block gambier and 2,700 tons of cubes. In 1877 it\r\ndiminished to 39,117 tons, owing to difficulties which had arisen\r\nbetween the Chinese dealers, who supplied the drug in a rather wet\r\nstate, and the European exporters.

This\r\ntribe consists of shrubs or trees with opposite leaves, 2-celled ovary,\r\ncapsular fruit, and numerous minute, vertical or ascending, peltate,\r\nwinged, albuminous seeds.\r\n\r\n(=A.=) _Remarks on the genus._—The genus _Cinchona_ is distinguished by\r\ndeciduous stipules, flowers in terminal panicles, 5-toothed superior\r\ncalyx, tubular corolla expanding into 5 lobes fringed at the margin.\r\nThe corolla is of an agreeable weak odour, and of a rosy or purplish\r\nhue or white. The fruit is a capsule of ovoid or subcylindrical form,\r\ndehiscing from the base (the fruit-stalk also splitting) into two\r\nvalves, which are held together at the apex by the thick permanent\r\ncalyx. The seeds, 30 to 40 in number, are imbricated vertically;\r\nthey are flat, winged all round by a broad membrane, which is very\r\nirregularly toothed or lacerated at the edge.\r\n\r\nThe Cinchonas are evergreen, with finely-veined leaves, traversed by a\r\nstrong midrib. The thick leafstalk, often of a fine red, is sometimes a\r\nsixth the length of the whole leaf, but usually shorter. The leaves are\r\novate, obovate, or nearly circular; in some species lanceolate, rarely\r\ncordate, always entire, glabrous or more rarely hirsute, often variable\r\nas to size and form in the same species.\r\n\r\nAmong the valuable species, several are distinguished by small pits\r\ncalled _scrobiculi_, situated on the under side of the leaf, in the\r\naxils of the veins which proceed from the midrib. These pits sometimes\r\nexude an astringent juice. In some species they are replaced by tufts\r\nof hair. The young leaves are sometimes purplish on the under side; in\r\nseveral species the full-grown foliage assumes before falling, rich\r\ntints of crimson or orange.\r\n\r\nThe species of Cinchona are so much alike that their definition is\r\na matter of the utmost difficulty, and only to be accomplished by\r\nresorting to a number of characters which taken singly are of no great\r\nimportance. Individual species are moreover frequently connected\r\ntogether by well-marked and permanent intermediate forms, so that\r\naccording to the expression of Howard, the whole form a continuous\r\nseries, the terminal members of which are scarcely more sharply\r\nseparated from the allied genera, than from plants of their own series.\r\n\r\nAs to the number and value of the species known, there is some\r\ndiversity of view. Weddell, in 1870, enumerated 33 species and 18\r\nsub-species, besides numerous varieties and sub-varieties. Bentham and\r\nHooker, in 1873, estimated the species as about 36.\r\n\r\nKuntze, in the book quoted at the end of the present article, proposed\r\nto reduce all the species to the four following:\r\n\r\n    1. _Cinchona Weddelliana_ O. Kuntze, nearly answering\r\n        to _C. Calisaya_ Weddell.\r\n\r\n    2. _C. Pavoniana_ O. Kuntze, including _C.\r\n        micrantha_ Ruiz and _Pavon_ and several allied\r\n        plants.\r\n\r\n    3. _C. Howardiana_ O. Kuntze, constituted of _C.\r\n        succirubra_ Pavon and a few other species of former\r\n        authors.\r\n\r\n    4. _C. Pahudiana_ Howard.\r\n\r\nKuntze, who has examined the living Cinchonæ as cultivated in India, is\r\nof the opinion that all the numerous forms hitherto observed, both in\r\nthe wild plants and in cultivation, are merely either belonging to the\r\nabove four species or deriving from them chiefly by hybridation. Though\r\nmuch in favour of a reduction of the species, we are not yet prepared\r\nto accept Kuntze’s arrangement.\r\n\r\n(=B.=) _Area, Climate and Soil._—The Cinchonas are natives of South\r\nAmerica, where they occur exclusively on the western side of the\r\ncontinent between 10° N. lat. and 22° S. lat., an area which includes\r\nportions of Venezuela, New Granada, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.\r\n\r\nThe plants are found in the mountain regions, no species whatever\r\nbeing known to inhabit the low alluvial plains. In Peru and Bolivia,\r\nthe region of the Cinchona forms a belt, 1300 miles in length,\r\noccupying the eastern slope of the Cordillera of the Andes.[1288]\r\nIn Ecuador and New Granada, the tree is not strictly limited to the\r\neastern slopes, but occurs on other of the Andine ranges.\r\n\r\nThe average altitude of the cinchoniferous region is given by Weddell\r\nas 5,000 to 8,000 feet above the sea-level. The highest limit, as noted\r\nby Karsten, is 11,000 feet. One valuable species, _C. succirubra_,\r\noccurs exceptionally as low as 2,600 feet. Generally, it may be said\r\nthat the altitude of the Cinchona zone decreases in proportion as it\r\nrecedes from the equator, and that the most valuable sorts are not\r\nfound lower than 5,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the tropical mountain regions in which the Cinchonas\r\nflourish, is extremely variable,—sunshine, showers, storms, and thick\r\nmist, alternating in rapid succession, yet with no very great range\r\nof temperature. A transient depression of the thermometer even to the\r\nfreezing point, and not unfrequent hail-showers, may be borne without\r\ndetriment by the more hardy species. Yet the mean temperature most\r\nfavourable for the generality of species, appears to be 12 to 20° C.\r\n(54 to 68° F.)\r\n\r\nClimatic agencies appear to influence the growth of Cinchona far more\r\nthan the composition of the soil. Though the tree occurs in a great\r\nvariety of geological formations, there is no distinct evidence that\r\nthese conditions control in any marked manner either the development\r\nof the tree or the chemical constitution of its bark. Manure on the\r\nother hand, though not increasing perceptibly luxuriance of growth,\r\nhas a decided effect in augmenting the richness of the bark in\r\nalkaloids.[1289]\r\n\r\n(=C.=) _Species yielding officinal barks._—The Cinchona Barks of\r\ncommerce are produced by about a dozen species; of these barks the\r\ngreater number are consumed solely in the manufacture of quinine. Those\r\nadmitted for pharmaceutical use are afforded by the following species:—\r\n\r\n1. _Cinchona officinalis_ Hooker[1290]—A native of Ecuador and Peru,\r\nexisting under several varieties. It forms a large tree, having\r\nlanceolate or ovate leaves, usually pointed, glabrous, and shining\r\non the upper surface, and scrobiculate on the under. The flowers are\r\nsmall, pubescent and in short lax panicles, and are succeeded by oblong\r\nor lanceolate capsules, ½ an inch or more in length.\r\n\r\n2. _C. Calisaya_ Weddell—Discovered by Weddell in 1847,[1291] although\r\nits bark had been an object of commerce since the latter half of the\r\nprevious century.\r\n\r\n[1288] That is to say the _eastern_ Cordillera, the western and lower\r\nrange being called the _Cordillera of the Coast_; no Cinchonas grow on\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n[1289] Broughton, in _Pharm. Journ._ Jan. 4, 1873. 521.\r\n\r\n[1290] Figured in _Bot. Magazine_, vol. 89 (1863) tab. 5364, including\r\n_C. Condaminea_ Humb. et Bonpl. and _C. Uritusinga_ Pavon.\r\n\r\n[1291] _Ann. des Sciences nat._, Bot. x. (1848) 6, and _Hist. nat. des\r\nQuinquinas_, 1849, tab. 3, figured in _Botanical Magazine_, 1873. 6052,\r\nand 1879. 6434.\r\n\r\nThe tree inhabits the warmest woods of the declivities which border\r\nthe valleys of Bolivia and South-eastern Peru, at an altitude of 5000\r\nto 6000 feet above the sea-level. More precisely, the chief localities\r\nfor the tree are the Bolivian provinces of Enquisivi, Yungas de la\r\nPaz, Larecaja or Sorata, Caupolican or Apolobamba, and Muñecas: thence\r\nit passes northward into the Peruvian province of Carabaya, suddenly\r\nceasing on the confines of the valley of Sandia, although, as Weddell\r\nobserved, the adjacent valleys are to all appearance precisely similar.\r\n\r\nWhen well grown, _C. Calisaya_ has a trunk often twice as thick as a\r\nman’s body, and a magnificent crown of foliage overtopping all other\r\ntrees of the forest. It has ovate capsules of about the same length (½\r\nan inch) as the elegant pinkish flowers, which are in large pyramidal\r\npanicles. The leaves are 3 to 6 inches long, of very variable form, but\r\nusually oblong and obtuse, rarely acute.\r\n\r\nA variety named after Joseph de Jussieu who first noticed it, β.\r\n_Josephiana_, but known in the country as _Ichu-Cascarilla_ or\r\n_Cascarilla del Pajonal_, differs from the preceding in that it is a\r\nshrub, 6 to 10 feet high, growing on the borders of mountain meadows\r\nand of thickets in the same regions as the larger form.\r\n\r\nOther forms known in Bolivia as _Calisaya zamba_, _morada_, _verde_ or\r\n_alta_, and _blanca_, have been distinguished by Weddell as varieties\r\nof _C. Calisaya_.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the year 1865, _Charles Ledger_, an English\r\ntraveller, obtained seeds of a superior Cinchona, which had been\r\ncollected near Pelechuco, eastwards of the lake Titicaca, about 68° W.\r\nlong. and 15° S. lat., in the Bolivian province of Caupolican. In the\r\nsame year the seeds arrived in England, but were subsequently sold to\r\nthe Dutch government, and raised with admirable success in Java, and\r\na little later also in private plantations in British India. The bark\r\nof “_Cinchona Ledgeriana_” has since proved by far the most productive\r\nin quinine of all Cinchona Barks. The tree is a mere form of C.\r\nCalisaya.[1292]\r\n\r\n3. _C. succirubra_ Pavon,[1293]—a magnificent tree, 50 to 80 feet high,\r\nformerly growing in all the valleys of the Andes which debouch in the\r\nplain of Guayaquil. The tree is now almost entirely confined to the\r\nforests of Guaranda on the western declivities of Chimborazo, at 2,000\r\nto 5,000 feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe bark appears to have been appreciated in its native country at an\r\nearly period, if we may conclude that the _Red Bark_ mentioned by La\r\nCondamine in 1737 was that under notice. It would seem, however, to\r\nhave scarcely reached Europe earlier than the second half of the last\r\ncentury.[1294] The tree has broadly oval leaves, attaining about a foot\r\nin length, nearly glabrous above, pubescent beneath, large terminal\r\npanicles of rosy flowers, succeeded by oblong capsules 1 to 1¼ inches\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThe other species of _Cinchona_, the bark of which is principally\r\nconsumed by the manufacturers of quinine, will be found briefly\r\nnoticed, together with the foregoing, in the conspectus at page 355.\r\n\r\n=History=—The early native history of Cinchona is lost in obscurity. No\r\nundoubted proofs have been handed down, to show that the aborigines of\r\nSouth America had any acquaintance with the medicinal properties of the\r\nbark. But traditions are not wanting.\r\n\r\n[1292] Ledger’s Calisaya is beautifully figured and exactly described\r\nin Howard’s _Quinology of the East Indian Plantations_, parts ii. and\r\niii.\r\n\r\n[1293] Figured in Howard’s _Nueva Quinologia_, art. _Chinchona\r\nsuccirubra_.\r\n\r\n[1294] Howard, _l.c._ p. 9.\r\n\r\nWilliam Arrot,[1295] a Scotch surgeon who visited Peru in the early\r\npart of the last century, states that the opinion then current at Loxa\r\nwas that the qualities and use of the barks of Cinchona were known to\r\nthe Indians before any Spaniard came among them. Condamine, as well as\r\nJussieu, heard the same statements, which appear to have been generally\r\nprevalent at the close of the 17th century.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy, on the other hand, that though the Peruvians\r\ntenaciously adhere to their traditional customs, they make no use at\r\nthe present day of Cinchona bark, but actually regard its employment\r\nwith repugnance.\r\n\r\nHumboldt[1296] declares that at Loxa the natives would rather die than\r\nhave recourse to what they consider so dangerous a remedy. Pöppig[1297]\r\n(1830) found a strong prejudice to prevail among the people of Huanuco\r\nagainst Cinchona as a remedy for fevers, and the same fact was observed\r\nfarther north by Spruce[1298] in 1861. The latter traveller narrates,\r\nthat it was impossible to convince the _cascarilleros_ of Ecuador that\r\ntheir _Red Bark_ could be wanted for any other purpose than dyeing\r\ncloth; and that even at Guayaquil there was a general dislike to the\r\nuse of quinine.\r\n\r\nMarkham[1299] notices the curious fact that the wallets of the native\r\nitinerant doctors, who from father to son have plied their art since\r\nthe days of the Incas, never contain cinchona bark.\r\n\r\nAlthough Peru was discovered in 1513, and submitted to the Spanish\r\nyoke by the middle of the century, no mention has been found of the\r\nfebrifuge bark with which the name of the country is connected, earlier\r\nthan the commencement of the 17th century.\r\n\r\nJoseph de Jussieu,[1300] who visited Loxa in 1739, relates that the use\r\nof the remedy was first made known to a Jesuit missionary, who being\r\nattacked by intermittent fever, was cured by the bark administered to\r\nhim by an Indian cacique at Malacotas, a village near Loxa. The date\r\nof this event is not given. The same story is related of the Spanish\r\ncorregidor of Loxa, Don Juan Lopez Canizares, who is said to have been\r\ncured of fever in 1630.\r\n\r\nEight years later, the wife of the viceroy of Peru, Luis Geronimo\r\nFernandez de Cabrera y Bobadilla, fourth count of Chinchon, having\r\nbeen attacked with fever, the same corregidor of Loxa sent a packet\r\nof powdered bark to her physician Juan de Vega, assuring him of its\r\nefficacy in the treatment of “_tertiana_.” The drug fully bore out its\r\nreputation, and the countess Ana was cured.[1301] Upon her recovery,\r\nshe caused to be collected large quantities of the bark, which she\r\nused to give away to those sick of fever, so that the medicine came to\r\nbe called _Polvo de la Condesa_, i.e. _The Countess’ Powder_. It was\r\ncertainly known in Spain the following year (1639), when it was first\r\ntried at Alcala de Henares near Madrid.[1302]\r\n\r\n[1295] _Phil Trans._ xl. for 1737-38. 81.\r\n\r\n[1296] _Der Gesellsch. naturf.

But the cure of the countess\r\nwas known in Europe much before this, for it is mentioned by Sebastiano\r\nBado in his _Anastasis, Corticis Peruviæ, seu Chinæ Chinæ defensio_\r\npublished at Genoa in 1663. When Bado wrote, it was a debated question\r\nwhether the bark was introduced to Europe by the count of Chinchon or\r\nby the Jesuit Fathers.\r\n\r\n[1302] Villerobel, quoted by Bado, _op. cit._ 202.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Peruvian Bark into Europe is described by\r\nChifflet, physician to the archduke Leopold of Austria, viceroy of the\r\nNetherlands and Burgundy, in his _Pulvis Febrifugus Orbis Americani\r\nventilatus_, published at Brussels in 1653 (or 1651?). He says that\r\namong the wonders of the day, many reckon the tree growing in the\r\nkingdom of Peru, which the Spaniards call _Polo de Calenturas_, i.e.\r\n_Lignum febrium_. Its virtues reside chiefly in the bark, which is\r\nknown as _China febris_, and which taken in powder drives off the\r\nfebrile paroxysms. He further states, that during the last few years\r\nthe bark has been imported into Spain, and thence sent to the Jesuit\r\nCardinal Joannes de Lugo at Rome.[1303] Chifflet adds, that it has\r\nbeen carried from Italy to Belgium by the Jesuit Fathers going to the\r\nelection of a general, but that it was also brought thither direct from\r\nPeru by Michael Belga, who had resided some years at Lima.\r\n\r\nChifflet, though candidly admitting the efficacy of the new drug when\r\nproperly used, was not a strong advocate for it; and his publication\r\nstarted an acrimonious controversy, in which Honoratius Faber, a Jesuit\r\n(1655), Fonseca, physician to Pope Innocent X., Sebastiano Bado[1304]\r\nof Genoa (1656 and 1663), and Sturm (1659) appeared in defence of the\r\nfebrifuge; while Plempius (1655), Glantz, an imperial physician of\r\nRatisbon (1653), Godoy, physician to the king of Spain (1653), René\r\nMoreau (1655), Arbinet and others contended in an opposite sense.\r\n\r\nFrom one of these disputants, Roland Sturm, a doctor of Louvain, who\r\nwrote in 1659,[1305] we learn that four years previously, some of the\r\nnew febrifuge had been sent by the archduke Leopold to the Spanish\r\nambassador at the Hague, and that he (Sturm) had been required to\r\nreport upon it. He further states, that the medicine was known in\r\nBrussels and Antwerp as _Pulvis Jesuiticus_, because the Jesuit Fathers\r\nwere in the habit of administering it gratis to indigent persons\r\nsuffering from quartan fever; but that it was more commonly called\r\n_Pulvis Peruanus_ or _Peruvianam Febrifugum_. At Rome it bore the name\r\nof _Pulvis eminentissimi Cardinalis de Lugo_, or _Pulvis patrum_; the\r\nJesuits at Rome received it from the establishments of their order\r\nin Peru, and used to give it away to the poor in Cardinal de Lugo’s\r\npalace. In 1658 Sturm saw 20 doses sent to Paris which cost 60 florins.\r\nHe gives a copy of the handbill[1306] of 1651 which the apothecaries of\r\nRome used to distribute with the costly powder.\r\n\r\n[1303] The cardinal belonged to a family of Seville, which town had the\r\nmonopoly of the trade with America.\r\n\r\n[1304] Bado in his _Anastasis_, lib. 3, quotes the opinion of many\r\npersons as coinciding with his own.\r\n\r\n[1305] _Febrifugi Peruviani Vindiciarum pars prior—Pulveris Historiam\r\ncomplectens ejusque vires et proprietates ...exhibens_, Delphis, 1669.\r\n12°.\r\n\r\n[1306] It is in these words:—_Modo di adoprare la Corteccia chiamata\r\ndella Febre_.—Questa Corteccia si porta dal Regno di Peru, e si chiama\r\nChina, o vero China della febre, laquale si adopra per la febre\r\nquartans, e terzana, che venga con freddo: s’adropra in questo modo,\r\ncioè:\r\n\r\nSe ne piglia dramme due, e si pista fina, con passarla per setaccio; e\r\ntre hore prima incirca, che debba venir la febre si mette in infusione\r\nin un bicchiero di vino bianco gagliardissimo, e quando il freddo\r\ncommincia à venire, ò si sente qualche minimo principio, si prende\r\ntutta la presa preparata, e si mette il patiente in letto.\r\n\r\nAvertasi, si potrà dare detta Corteccia nel modo sudetto nella febre\r\nterzana, quando quella sia fermata in stato di molti giorni.\r\n\r\nL’esperienza continua, hà liberata quasi tutti quelli, che l’hanno\r\npresa, purgato prima bene il corpo, e per quattro giorni doppo non\r\npigliar’ niuna sorte di medicamento, ma auvertasi di non darla se\r\nnon con licenza delli Sig. Medici, acciò giudicano se sia in tempo à\r\nproposito di pigliarla.\r\n\r\nThe drug began to be known in England about 1655.[1307] The _Mercurius\r\nPoliticus_ one of the earliest English newspapers, contains in several\r\nof its numbers for 1658,[1308] a year remarkable for the prevalence\r\nin England of an epidemic remittent fever, advertisements offering\r\nfor sale—“_the excellent powder known by the name of the Jesuit’s\r\nPowder_”—brought over by James Thomson, merchant of Antwerp.\r\n\r\nBrady, professor of physic at Cambridge, prescribed bark about this\r\ntime; and in 1660, Willis, a physician of great eminence, reported it\r\nas coming into daily use. This is also evidenced, with regard to the\r\ncontinent, by the pharmaceutical tariffs of the cities of Leipzig and\r\nFrankfurt of the year 1669, where “_China Chinæ_” has a place. ⅛ of an\r\nounce (a “quint”) is quoted in the latter at 50 kreuzers (about 1s.\r\n6d.), whereas the same quantity of opium is valued at 4 kreuzers,[1309]\r\ncamphor 2 kreuzers, balsam of Peru 8 kreuzers.\r\n\r\nAmong those who contributed powerfully to the diffusion of the new\r\nmedicine, was Robert Talbor _alias_ Tabor. In his “Pyretologia” (see\r\nAppendix, T.) he by no means intimates that his method of cure depends\r\non the use of bark. On the contrary, he cautions his readers against\r\nthe dangerous effects of Jesuit’s Powder when administered by unskilful\r\npersons, yet admits that, properly given, it is a “noble and safe\r\nmedicine.”\r\n\r\nTalbor’s reputation increasing, he was appointed in 1678 physician in\r\nordinary to Charles II., and in 1679, the king being ill of tertian\r\nfever at Windsor, Talbor cured him by his secret remedy.[1310] He\r\nacquired similar favour in France, and upon Talbor’s death (1681),\r\nLouis XIV. ordered the publication of his method of cure, which\r\naccordingly appeared by Nicolas de Blegny, surgeon to the king.[1311]\r\nThis was immediately translated into English, under the title of _The\r\nEnglish Remedy: or, Talbor’s Wonderful Secret for Cureing of Agues and\r\nFeavers.—Sold by the Author Sir Robert Talbor to the most Christian\r\nKing and since his Death, ordered by his Majesty to be published in\r\nFrench, for the benefit of his subjects, and now translated into\r\nEnglish for Publick Good_ (Lond. 1682).\r\n\r\nCinchona bark was now accepted into the domain of regular medicine,\r\nthough its efficacy was by no means universally acknowledged. It first\r\nappeared in the London Pharmacopœia in 1677, under the name of _Cortex\r\nPeruanus_.\r\n\r\n[1307] So says Sir G. Baker, who has traced the introduction of\r\nCinchona in a very able paper published in the _Medical Transactions_\r\nof the College of Physicians of London, iii. (1785) 141-216.\r\n\r\n[1308] Namely No. 422. June 24-July 1; No. 426. July 22-29; No. 439.\r\nOct. 21-28. No. 545. Dec. 9-16.—We have examined the copy at the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\n[1309] Ph.

On the 3rd and 4th\r\nof February, 1737, he visited the Sierra de Cajanuma, 2½ leagues from\r\nLoxa, and there collected specimens of the tree now known as _Cinchona\r\nofficinalis_ var. _a. Condaminea_. At that period the very large\r\ntrees had already become rare, but there were still specimens having\r\ntrunks thicker than a man’s body. Cajanuma was the home of the first\r\ncinchona bark brought to Europe; and in early times it enjoyed such a\r\nreputation, that certificates drawn up before a notary were provided as\r\nproof that parcels of bark were the produce of that favoured locality.\r\n\r\nJoseph de Jussieu, botanist to the French expedition with which\r\nLa Condamine was connected, gathered, near Loxa in 1739, a second\r\n_Cinchona_ subsequently named by Vahl _C. pubescens_, a species of no\r\nmedicinal value.\r\n\r\nIn 1742 Linnæus established the genus _Cinchona_,[1313] and in 1753\r\nfirst described the species _C. officinalis_, recently restored and\r\nexactly characterized by Hooker, aided by specimens supplied to him by\r\nMr. Howard.\r\n\r\nThe cinchona trees were believed to be confined to the region around\r\nLoxa, until 1752 when Miguel de Santisteban, superintendent of the mint\r\nat Santa Fé, discovered some species in the neighbourhood of Popayan\r\nand Pasto.\r\n\r\nIn 1761 José Celestino Mutis, physician to the Marquis de la Vega,\r\nviceroy of New Granada, arrived at Carthagena from Cadiz, and\r\nimmediately set about collecting materials for writing a _Flora_ of\r\nthe country. This undertaking he carried on with untiring energy,\r\nespecially from the year 1782 until the end of his life in 1808,—first\r\nfor seven years at Real del Sapo and Mariquita at the foot of the\r\nCordillera de Quindiu, and subsequently at Santa Fé de Bogotá. Mutis\r\ngave up his medical appointment in 1772, for the purpose of entering a\r\nreligious order, and ten years later was entrusted by the Government\r\nwith the establishment and direction of a large museum of natural\r\nhistory, first at Mariquita, afterwards at Santa Fé.\r\n\r\nA position similar to that of Mutis in New Granada had also been\r\nconferred in 1777 on the botanists Hipolito Ruiz and José Pavon with\r\nregard to southern Peru, whence originated the well-known _Flora\r\nPeruviana et Chilensis_,[1314] as well as most important direct\r\ncontributions to our knowledge on the subject of Cinchona.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time (1776), Renquizo (Renquifo or Renjifo) found\r\ncinchona trees in the neighbourhood of Huanuco, in the central tract of\r\nPeru, whereby the monopoly of the district of Loxa was soon broken up.\r\n\r\n[1312] _Sur l’arbre de Quinquina_ par M. de la Condamine—_Mém. de\r\nl’Académie royale des Sciences pour l’année 1738_. pp. 226-243, with\r\ntwo plates.\r\n\r\n[1313] Markham has vigorously contended that the name _Cinchona_ should\r\nbe altered to _Chinchona_ as better commemorating the countess of\r\nChinchon. But the inconvenience of changing so well-established a name\r\nand its many derivatives, has out-weighed these considerations.—See\r\nlist of works relating to Cinchona at the end of the present article.\r\n\r\n[1314] Published at Madrid, 1798-1802, in 4 volumes folio, with 425\r\nplates.\r\n\r\nNumerous and important quinological discoveries were subsequently made\r\nby Mutis, or rather by his pupils Caldas, Zea, and Restrepo,[1315]\r\nas well as on the other hand by Ruiz and Pavon, and their successors\r\nTafalla and Manzanilla. Mutis did not bring his labours to any definite\r\nconclusion, and his extensive botanical collections and 5,000 coloured\r\ndrawings, were sent to Madrid only in 1817, and there remained in a\r\nlamentable state of neglect.\r\n\r\nSome of his observations first appeared in print in 1793-94, under\r\nthe title of _El Arcano de la Quina_ in the _Diario_, a local paper\r\nof Santa Fé, and were reprinted at Madrid in 1828 by Don Manuel\r\nHernandez de Gregorio. The botanical descriptions of the cinchonas\r\nof New Granada, forming the fourth part of the _Arcano_, remained\r\nforgotten and lost to science until rescued by Markham and published\r\nin 1867.[1316] The drawings belonging to the descriptions were\r\nphotographed and engraved a little later, and form part of Triana’s\r\n_Nouvelles Etudes sur les Quinquinas_, which appeared in 1870.\r\n\r\nThe two Peruvian botanists succeeded somewhat better in securing\r\ntheir results. Ruiz in 1792, in his _Quinologia_,[1317] and in 1801\r\nconjointly with Pavon in a supplement thereto, brought together a\r\nportion of their important labours relating to cinchona. But an\r\nessential part called _Nueva Quinologia_,[1318] written between 1821\r\nand 1826, remained unpublished; and after an oblivion of over thirty\r\nyears, it came by purchase into the hands of Mr. John Eliot Howard, who\r\npublished it, and with rare liberality enriched it with 27 magnificent\r\ncoloured plates, mostly taken from the very specimens of Pavon lying in\r\nthe herbarium of Madrid.\r\n\r\nBetween the pupils of Mutis on the one hand, and those of Ruiz and\r\nPavon on the other, there arose an acrimonious controversy regarding\r\ntheir respective discoveries, which has been equitably summarized by\r\nTriana in the work just mentioned.\r\n\r\n=Production=—The hardships of bark-collecting in the primeval forests\r\nof South America are of the severest kind, and undergone only by\r\nthe half-civilized Indians and people of mixed race, in the pay of\r\nspeculators or companies located in the towns. Those who are engaged\r\nin the business, especially the collectors themselves, are called\r\n_Cascarilleros_ or _Cascadores_, from the Spanish word _Cascara_, bark.\r\nA major-domo at the head of the collectors directs the proceedings of\r\nthe several bands in the forest itself, where provisions and afterwards\r\nthe produce are stowed away in huts of slight construction.\r\n\r\nArrot in 1736, and Weddell and Karsten in our own day, have given from\r\npersonal observation a striking picture of these operations.\r\n\r\n[1315] “ ... Mutis n’avait qu’une notion inexacte et confuse du genre\r\n_Cinchona_ et de ses véritables caractères; c’est en définitive\r\nqu’aucune de ses espèces, dans le sens strict du mot, n’a été reconnue\r\nni découverte par lui.”—Triana, _Nouv. Etudes_, p. 8.\r\n\r\n[1316] Markham, _Chinchona Species of New Granada_, Lond. 1867.\r\n\r\n[1317] _Quinologia, ó tratado de árbol de la Quina, ó Cascarilla_,\r\nMadrid, 1792. 4°. pp. 103.\r\n\r\n[1318] _Supplemento á la Quinologia_, Madrid, 1801. 4°. pp. 154.\r\n\r\nThe cascarillero having found his tree, has usually to free its stem\r\nfrom the luxuriant climbing and parasitic plants with which it is\r\nencircled. This done, he begins in most cases at once to remove, after\r\na previous beating, the sapless layer of outer bark. In order to detach\r\nthe valuable inner bark, longitudinal and transverse incisions are made\r\nas high as can be reached on the stem. The tree is then felled, and the\r\npeeling completed. In most cases, but especially if previously beaten,\r\nthe bark separates easily from the wood. In many localities it has to\r\nbe dried by a fire made on the floor of a hut, the bark being placed\r\non hurdles above,—a most imperfect arrangement. In Southern Peru and\r\nBolivia however, according to Weddell, even the thickest Calisaya bark\r\nis dried in the sun without requiring the aid of the fire.\r\n\r\nThe thinner bark as it dries rolls up into tubes or quills called\r\n_canutos_ or _canutillos_, while the pieces stripped from the trunks\r\nare made to dry flat by being placed one upon another and loaded with\r\nweights, and are then known as _plancha_ or _tabla_. The bark of the\r\nroot was formerly neglected, but is now in several instances brought\r\ninto the market.\r\n\r\nAfter drying, the barks are either assorted, chiefly according to\r\nsize, or all are packed without distinction in sacks or bales. In some\r\nplaces, as at Popayan, the bark is even _stamped_, in order to reduce\r\nits bulk as much as possible. The dealers in the export towns enclose\r\nthe bark in _serons_[1319] of raw bullock-hide, which, contracting as\r\nit dries, tightly compresses the contents (100 lb. or more) of the\r\npackage. In many places however wooden chests are used for the packing\r\nof bark.\r\n\r\n=Conveyance to the Coast and Commercial Statistics=—The ports to which\r\nbark is conveyed for shipment to Europe are not very numerous.\r\n\r\nGuayaquil on the Pacific coast is the most important for produce of\r\nEcuador. The quantity shipped thence in 1871 was 7,859 quintals.[1320]\r\nPitayo bark is largely exported from Buenaventura in the Bay of Choco\r\nfurther north.\r\n\r\nPayta, the most northerly port of Peru, and Callao, the port of Lima,\r\nlikewise export bark, the latter being the natural outlet for the barks\r\nof Central Peru from Huanuco to Cusco.\r\n\r\nIslay, and more particularly Arica, receive the valuable barks of\r\nCarabaya and of the high valleys of Bolivia. In 1877 the export of\r\nArica was equal to 5100 cwt.\r\n\r\nThe barks of Peru and Bolivia find an exceptional outlet also by the\r\nAmazon and its tributaries, and are shipped to Europe from port of\r\nBrazil. Howard[1321] has given an interesting account of one of the\r\nfirst attempts to utilize this eastern route, made by Senr. Pedro Rada\r\nin 1868.\r\n\r\nThere is a large export of the barks of New Granada, principally from\r\nSanta Marta, whence the shipments[1322] in 1871 were 3,415,149 lb.; and\r\nin 1872, 2,758,991 lb. From the neighbouring port of Savanilla, which\r\nrepresents the city of Barranquilla, the sea-terminus of the navigation\r\nof the Magdalena, the export of bark in 1871 was 1,043,835 lb., value\r\n£38,715;[1323] it amounted to 2 millions of kilogrammes in 1877. All\r\nColumbia is stated, in 1877, to have shipped 3½ millions of kilogrammes\r\nof bark; yet a good deal of the excellent barks of the Columbian State\r\nof Santander, especially those of the neighbourhood of Bucaramanga,\r\nfind their way to Maracaibo, taking the name of that place.\r\n\r\n[1319] From _zurrón_, the Spanish name for a pouch or game-bag.\r\n\r\n[1320] _Consular Reports_, presented to Parliament, July 1872.\r\n\r\n[1321] Seemann’s _Journ. of Bot._ vi.

The imports into the United Kingdom in\r\n1876 were 26,021 cwt., valued at £272,154.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation=—The reckless system of bark-cutting in the forests of\r\nSouth America, which has resulted in the utter extermination of the\r\ntree from many localities, has aroused the attention of the Old World,\r\nand has at length prompted serious efforts to cultivate the tree on a\r\nlarge scale in other countries.\r\n\r\nThe idea of cultivating Cinchonas out of their native regions was\r\nadvanced by Ruiz in 1792, and by Fée of Strassburg in 1824.[1324]\r\nRoyle[1325] pointed out in 1839 that suitable localities for the\r\npurpose might be found in the Neilgherry Hills and probably in many\r\nother parts of India, and argued indefatigably in favour of the\r\nintroduction of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe subject was also urged in reference to Java in 1837 by Fritze,\r\ndirector of medical affairs in that island; in 1846 by Miquel, and\r\nsubsequently by other Dutch botanists and chemists.[1326]\r\n\r\nLiving Cinchonas had been taken to Algeria as early as 1849, by the\r\nintervention of the Jesuits of Cusco, but their cultivation met with no\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nWeddell in 1848 brought cinchona seeds from South America to France,\r\nand strenuously insisted on the importance of cultivating the plant.\r\nHis seeds, especially those of _C. Calisaya_, germinated at the Jardin\r\ndes Plantes in Paris, and in June 1850, living seedlings were sent to\r\nAlgeria; and in April 1852, through the Dutch Government, to Java.\r\n\r\nThe first important attempts at cinchona cultivation were made by the\r\nDutch. Under the auspices of the Colonial Minister Pahud, afterwards\r\nGovernor-General of the Dutch East Indies, the botanist Hasskarl was\r\ndespatched to Peru for the purpose of obtaining seeds and plants. His\r\nmission was so far successful, that a collection of plants contained in\r\n21 Wardian cases, was shipped in August 1854 from Callao, in a frigate\r\nsent expressly to receive them. Notwithstanding every care, the plants\r\ndid not reach Java in good condition; and when Hasskarl resigned his\r\nappointment in 1856, he bequeathed to his successor Junghuhn only 167\r\nyoung cinchonas, though 400 specimens had been shipped from South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[1324] _Cours d’Hist. nat. pharmaceutique_, ii. (1828) 252.\r\n\r\n[1325] _Illustrations of the Bot. of the Himalayan Mountains_, i.\r\n(1839) 240.\r\n\r\n[1326] According to K. W. van Gorkom, suggestions to the same end were\r\nmade to the Dutch Government as early as 1829 by Reinwardt.\r\n\r\nAn impulse to the project of cinchona-planting was given in 1852 by\r\nRoyle, in a report addressed to the East India Company, in which he\r\npointed out that the Government of India were then spending more than\r\n£7,000 a year for Cinchona bark, in addition to about £25,000 for\r\nquinine.[1327]\r\n\r\nAfter some unsatisfactory endeavours on the part of the British\r\nGovernment to obtain plants and seeds through the intervention of H.\r\nM. Consuls in South America, Mr. Markham offered his services, which\r\nwere accepted. Markham, though not a professed botanist, was well\r\nqualified for the task by a previous acquaintance with the country\r\nand people of Peru and Bolivia, and by a knowledge of the Spanish\r\nand Quichua languages,—and even more so by a rare amount of zeal,\r\nintelligence, and forethought. Being fully aware of the difficulties of\r\nthe undertaking, he earnestly insisted that nothing should be neglected\r\nwhich could ensure success; and in particular made repeated demands\r\nfor a steam-vessel to convey the young plants across the Pacific to\r\nIndia, which unfortunately were not complied with. He further urged the\r\ndesirableness of not confining operations to a single district, but of\r\nendeavouring to procure by different collectors all the more valuable\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe prudence of this latter suggestion was evident, and Markham was\r\nenabled to engage the services of Richard Spruce, the distinguished\r\nbotanist, then resident in Ecuador, who expressed his readiness\r\nto undertake a search for the Red Bark trees (_C. succirubra_) in\r\nthe forests of Chimborazo. He also secured the co-operation of G.\r\nJ. Pritchett for the neighbourhood of Huanuco, and of two skilful\r\ngardeners, John Weir and Robert Cross. The last named was employed in\r\n1861 to procure seeds of _C. officinalis_ from the Sierra de Cajanuma\r\nnear Loxa, and in 1868-64 those of _C. pitayensis_ from the province of\r\nPitayo in Ecuador.[1328]\r\n\r\nMarkham reserved for himself the border-lands of Peru and Bolivia, in\r\norder to obtain _C. Calisaya_; and for this purpose started from Islay\r\nin March 1860. Arriving in the middle of April by way of Arequipa and\r\nPuno, at Curcero, the capital of the province of Carabaya, he made\r\nhis way to the village of Sandia, near which he met with the first\r\nspecimens of _Cinchona_ in the form of the shrubby variety of _C.\r\nCalisaya_, termed _Josephiana_. He afterwards found the better variety\r\n_a. vera_, and also _C. ovata_ R. et P., _C. micrantha_ R. et P., and\r\n_C. pubescens_ Vahl. Of these sorts, but chiefly of the first three,\r\n456 plants were shipped at Islay in June 1860.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the hostile attitude of the people, and the jealousy\r\nof the Bolivian Government, lest an important monopoly should be broken\r\nup, added to the difficulties arising from insalubrious climate and the\r\nwant of roads, the obstacles encountered by Markham were very great,\r\nand no attempt could be made to wait for the ripening of the seeds of\r\nthe Calisaya, which takes place in the month of August.[1329]\r\n\r\n[1327] In 1870, the Indian Government purchased no less than 81,600\r\nounces of sulphate of quinine, besides 8,832 ounces of the sulphates\r\nof cinchonine, cinchonidine and quinidine. The quantities bought in\r\nsubsequent years have been much smaller until the present year (1874).\r\n\r\n[1328] _Report on the Expedition to procure seeds of C. Condaminea_\r\n(1862); also _Report to the Under Secretary of State for India on the\r\nPitayo Chinchona_, by Robt. Cross, 1865.\r\n\r\n[1329] Great difficulty was at first experienced in successfully\r\nconveying living Cinchona plants to India, even in Wardian cases; and\r\nthe collections formed by Hasskarl, Markham, and Pritchett almost all\r\nperished after reaching their destination (Markham’s letter, 26 Feb.\r\n1861). But the propagation by seed has proved very rapid.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Spruce was successful, but was also attended with\r\nmuch difficulty and danger, of which there are vivid pictures in the\r\ninteresting narratives by himself and by Cross, published in the\r\nParliamentary Returns of 1863 and 1866.[1330]\r\n\r\nThe service entrusted, to Pritchett was also efficiently performed; and\r\nhe succeeded in bringing to Southampton six cases containing plants of\r\n_C. micrantha_ and _C. nitida_, besides a large supply of seeds.\r\n\r\nSome important supplies of plants and seed for British India have\r\nlikewise been obtained from the Dutch plantations in Java. Seeds of _C.\r\nlancifolia_, the tree affording the valuable bark of New Granada, were\r\nprocured through Dr. Karsten.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the arrival in India of the first consignment of plants,\r\ncareful inquiries were instituted from a meteorological and geological\r\npoint of view, as to the localities most adapted for the cultivation.\r\nThis resulted in the selection for the first trial of certain spots\r\namong the Neilgherry (or Nilgiri) Hills on the south-west coast of\r\nIndia and in the Madras Presidency. Of this district, the chief town\r\nis Ootocamund (or Utakamand), situated about 60 miles south of Mysore\r\nand the same distance from the Indian Ocean. Here the first plantation\r\nwas established in a woody ravine, 7,000 feet above the sea-level, a\r\nspot pronounced by Mr. Markham to be exceedingly analogous, as respects\r\nvegetation and climate, to the Cinchona valleys of Carabaya. Other\r\nplantations were formed in the same neighbourhood, and so rapid was the\r\npropagation, that in September 1866, there were more than 1½ millions\r\nof Cinchona plants on the Neilgherry Hills alone.[1331] The species\r\nthat grows best there is _C. officinalis_.\r\n\r\nThe number was stated to be in 1872, 2,639,285, not counting the trees\r\nof private planters. The largest are about 30 feet high, with trunks\r\nover 3 feet in girth. The area of the Government plantations on the\r\nNeilgherry Hills is 950 acres.[1332]\r\n\r\nPlantations have also been made in the coffee-producing districts of\r\nWynaad, and in Coorg, Travancore and Tinnevelly, in all instances, we\r\nbelieve, as private speculations.\r\n\r\nCinchona plantations have been established by the Government of India\r\nin the valleys of the Himalaya in British Sikkim,[1333] and some have\r\nbeen started in the same region by private enterprise. In the former\r\nthere were on the 31st March 1870, more than 1½ millions of plants\r\npermanently placed, the species growing best being _C. succirubra_\r\nand _C. Calisaya_. The Cinchona plantation of Rungbi near Darjiling\r\n(British Sikkim) covered in 1872 2,000 acres. In the Kangra valley of\r\nthe Western Himalaya, plantations have been commenced, as well as in\r\nthe Bombay Presidency, and in British Burma.\r\n\r\n[1330] _Correspondence relating to the introduction of the Chinchona\r\nPlant into India_, ordered by the House of Commons to be printed 20\r\nMarch 1863 and 18 June 1866.\r\n\r\n[1331] Blue Book (Chinchona Cultivation, 1870. p. 30).—A name that must\r\nalways be remembered in connection with the Neilgherry plantations,\r\nis that of William Graham McIvor, who by his rare practical skill and\r\nsagacity in the cultivation and management of the tree, has rendered\r\nmost signal services in its propagation in India.\r\n\r\n[1332] _Moral and material progress and condition of India during\r\n1871-72_, presented to Parliament 1873. p. 33.\r\n\r\n[1333] The first annual Report dates from 1862 to 1863; I am indebted\r\nto Dr. King for that of 1876-1877.—F. A. F.\r\n\r\nCeylon offers favourable spots for the cultivation of Cinchona, in\r\nthe mountain region which occupies the centre of the island, as\r\nat Hakgalle, near Neuera-Ellia, 5,000 feet above the sea, where a\r\nplantation was formed by Government in 1861. The production of bark has\r\nbeen taken up with spirit by the coffee-planters of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe Government of India has acted with the greatest liberality in\r\ndistributing plants and seeds of Cinchona, and in promoting the\r\ncultivation of the tree among the people of India; and it has freely\r\ngranted supplies of seed to other countries.\r\n\r\nThe plantations of Java commenced by Hasskarl, increased under\r\nJunghuhn’s management to such an extent, that in December 1862 there\r\nwere 1,360,000 seedlings and young trees, among which however the more\r\nvaluable species, as _C. Calisaya_, _C. lancifolia_, _C. micrantha_\r\nand _C. succirubra_, were by far the least numerous, whereas _C.\r\nPahudiana_, of which the utility was by no means well established,\r\namounted to over a million. The disproportionate multiplication of this\r\nlast was chiefly due to its quickly yielding an abundance of seeds, and\r\nto its rapid and vigorous growth. Another defect in the early Dutch\r\nSystem of cultivation arose from the notion that the Cinchona requires\r\nto be grown in the shade of other trees, and to a less successful plan\r\nof multiplying by cuttings and layers.\r\n\r\nThese and other matters were the source of animated and often bitter\r\ndiscussions, which terminated on the one hand by the death of Junghuhn\r\nin 1864, and on the other by the skilful investigations of De Vry. This\r\neminent chemist was despatched by the Government of Holland in 1857 to\r\nJava, that he might devote his chemical knowledge to the investigation\r\nof the natural productions of the island, including the then newly\r\nintroduced Cinchona. It was March 16th, 1859, when Dr. de Vry laid\r\nbefore the governor-general, Mr. Pahud, the first crystals of sulphate\r\nof quinine he had prepared from bark grown in that island.\r\n\r\nUnder K. W. van Gorkom, who was appointed superintendent in 1864, the\r\nDutch plantations have assumed a very prosperous state. J. C. Bernelot\r\nMoens,[1334] the present director, stated that at the end of 1878 the\r\nleading species was Calisaya in its various forms, including more than\r\n400,000 plants of Ledger’s Calisaya. Numerous analyses of Bernelot\r\nMoens show a percentage of from 4½ to 10·6 of quinine in the latter\r\nvariety. Some of them, however, in December 1878, afforded not more\r\nthan 0·64 per cent. of quinine and 1·26 of cinchonidine.\r\n\r\nThe regular shipments of the barks from Java to the Amsterdam market\r\nare going on, and the barks are sold there with regard to the results\r\nof the government chemist’s analyses.\r\n\r\nCinchona Bark from the Indian plantations began to be brought into the\r\nLondon market in 1867,[1335] and now arrives in constantly increasing\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nThe history of the transplantation of the Cinchona down to the year\r\n1867 has been made the subject of the report of Soubeiran and Delondre\r\nmentioned at the end of the present article.\r\n\r\n[1334] I am indebted to the Dutch administration for their interesting\r\nstatistical documents relating to Cinchona.—F. A. F.\r\n\r\n[1335] When I was in London, in August 1867, I went to Finsbury Place,\r\nto meet Mr. Spruce, and was happy enough to find there also Mr. Howard,\r\nwho presented Mr. S. and myself with market samples of the _first_\r\nimportation of _C. succirubra_, from Denison plantation, Ootacamund.—F.\r\nA. F.\r\n\r\n=Description=—(=A.=) _Of Cinchona Barks generally_—In the development\r\nof their bark, the various species of Cinchona exhibit considerable\r\ndiversity. Many are distinguished from an early stage by an abundant\r\nexfoliation of the outer surface, while in others this takes place\r\nto a smaller degree, or only as the bark becomes old. The external\r\nappearance of the bark varies therefore very much, by reason of the\r\ngreater or less development of the suberous coat. The barks of young\r\nstems and branches have a greyish tint more or less intense, while the\r\nouter bark of old wood displays the more characteristic shades of brown\r\nor red, especially after removal of the corky layers.\r\n\r\nIn the living bark, these colours are very pale, and only acquire their\r\nfinal hue by exposure to the air, and drying. Some of them however are\r\ncharacteristic of individual species, or at least of certain groups,\r\nso that the distinctions originated by the bark-collectors of _pale_,\r\n_yellow_, _red_, etc.[1336] and adopted by druggists, are not without\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nIn texture, the barks vary in an important manner by reason of\r\ndiversity in anatomical structure. Their fracture especially depends\r\nupon the number, size, and arrangement of the liber-fibres, as will be\r\nshown in our description of their microscopic characters.\r\n\r\nThe taste in all species is bitter and disagreeable, and in some there\r\nis in addition a decided astringency. Most species have no marked\r\nodour, at least in the dried state. But this is not the case in that of\r\n_C. officinalis_, the smell of which is characteristic.\r\n\r\n(=B.=) _Of the Barks used in pharmacy_—For pharmaceutical preparations\r\nas distinguished from the pure alkaloids and their salts, the Cinchona\r\nbarks employed are chiefly of three kinds.\r\n\r\n1. _Pale Cinchona Bark_, _Loxa Bark_, _Crown Bark_[1337]—This bark,\r\nwhich previous to the use of Quinine and for long afterwards, was the\r\nordinary _Peruvian Bark_ of English medicine, is only found in the\r\nform of quills, which are occasionally as much as a foot in length,\r\nbut are more often only a few inches or are reduced to still smaller\r\nfragments. The quills are from ¾ down to an ⅛ of an inch in diameter,\r\noften double, and variously twisted and shrunken. The thinnest bark\r\nis scarcely stouter than writing paper; the thickest may be ⅒ of an\r\ninch or more.[1338] The pieces have a blackish brown or dark greyish\r\nexternal surface, variously blotched with silver-grey, and often beset\r\nwith large and beautiful lichens. The surface of some of the quills\r\nis longitudinally wrinkled and moderately smooth; but in the majority\r\nit is distinctly marked by transverse cracks, and is rough and harsh\r\nto the touch. The inner side is closely striated and of a bright\r\nyellowish-brown.\r\n\r\nThe bark breaks easily with a fracture which exhibits very short fibres\r\non the inner side. It has a well-marked odour _sui generis_, and an\r\nastringent bitter taste. Though chiefly afforded by _C. officinalis_,\r\nsome other species occasionally contribute to furnish the Loxa Bark of\r\ncommerce as shown in the conspectus at p. 355.\r\n\r\n[1336] The following are common terms in reference to the barks of\r\nPeru:—_Amarilla_ (yellow), _blanca_ (white), _colorado_ or _roja_\r\n(red), _naranjada_ (orange), _negrilla_ (brown).\r\n\r\n[1337] _Cortex Cinchonæ pallidæ_; F. _Quinquina Loxa_; G. _Loxachina_.\r\nThe term _Crown Bark_ was originally restricted to a superior sort of\r\nLoxa Bark, shipped for the use of the royal family of Spain.\r\n\r\n[1338] In the old collections of the Royal College of Physicians, there\r\nare specimens of very thick Loxa Bark, of a quality quite unknown there\r\nat the present day. They are doubtless the produce of ancient trees,\r\nsuch as were noticed by La Condamine.\r\n\r\n2. _Calisaya Bark_, _Yellow Cinchona Bark_.[1339]—This bark, which is\r\nthe most important of those commonly used in medicine, is found in flat\r\npieces (α.), and in quills (β.), both afforded by _C. Calisaya_ Wedd.,\r\nthough usually imported separated.\r\n\r\nα. _Flat Calisaya_—is in irregular flat pieces, a foot or more in\r\nlength by 3 to 4 inches wide, but usually smaller, and ²/₁₀ to ⁴/₁₀ of\r\nan inch in thickness; devoid of suberous layers and consisting almost\r\nsolely of liber, of uniform texture, compact and ponderous. Its colour\r\nis a rusty orange-brown, with darker stains on the outer surface. The\r\nlatter is roughened with shallow longitudinal depressions, sometimes\r\ncalled _digital furrows_.[1340] The inner side has a wavy, close,\r\nfibrous texture. The bark breaks transversely with a fibrous fracture;\r\nthe fibres of the broken ends are very short, easily detached, and with\r\na lens are seen to be many of them faintly yellowish and translucent.\r\n\r\nA well-marked variety, known as _Bolivian Calisaya_, is distinguished\r\nfor its greater thinness, closer texture, and for containing numerous\r\nlaticiferous ducts which are wanting in common flat Calisaya bark.\r\n\r\nβ. _Quill Calisaya_—is found in tubes ¾ to 1½ inch thick, often rolled\r\nup at both edges, thus forming double quills. They are always coated\r\nwith a thick, rugged, corky layer, marked with deep longitudinal and\r\ntransverse cracks, the edges of which are somewhat elevated. This\r\nsuberous coat, which is silvery white or greyish, is easily detached,\r\nleaving its impression on the cinnamon-brown middle layer. The inner\r\nside is dark brown and finely fibrous. The transverse fracture is\r\nfibrous but very short. The same bark also occurs in quills of very\r\nsmall size, and is then not distinguishable with certainty from Loxa\r\nbark.\r\n\r\n3. _Red Cinchona Bark._—Though still retaining a place in the British\r\nPharmacopœia, this is by far the least important of the Cinchona barks\r\nemployed in pharmacy. But as the tree yielding it (_C. succirubra_) is\r\nnow being cultivated on a large scale in India, the bark may probably\r\ncome more freely into use.\r\n\r\nRed Bark of large stems, which is the most esteemed kind, occurs in\r\nthe form of flat or channelled pieces, sometimes as much as ½ an inch\r\nin thickness, coated with their suberous envelope which is rugged and\r\nwarty. Its outermost layer in the young bark has a silvery appearance.\r\nThe inner surface is close and fibrous and of a brick-red hue. The bark\r\nbreaks with a short fibrous fracture.[1341]\r\n\r\n(=C.=) _Of the Barks not used in pharmacy_—Among the non-officinal\r\nbarks, the most important are afforded by _Cinchona lancifolia_ Mutis\r\nand _C. pitayensis_ Wedd., natives of the Cordilleras of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThese barks are largely imported and used for making quinine, the\r\nformer under the name of _Columbian_, _Carthagena_, or _Caqueta bark_.\r\nIt varies much in appearance, but is generally of an orange-brown;\r\nthe corky coat, which scales off easily, is shining and whitish. The\r\nbarks of _C. lancifolia_ often occur in fine large quills or thick\r\nflattish pieces. Their anatomical structure agrees in all varieties\r\nwhich we have examined, in the remarkable number of thick-walled and\r\ntangentially-extended cells of the middle cortical layer and the\r\nmedullary rays. In percentage of alkaloids, Carthagena barks are liable\r\nto great variation.\r\n\r\n[1339] _Cortex Cinchonæ flavæ_, _Cortex Chinæ regius_; F. _Quinquina\r\nCalisaya_; G. _Königschina_.\r\n\r\n[1340] From the notion that they resemble the marks left by drawing the\r\nfingers over wet clay.\r\n\r\n[1341] Thick Red Bark that happens to have a very deep and brilliant\r\ntint is eagerly bought at a high price for the Paris market.\r\n\r\nThe _Pitayo Barks_ are restricted to the south-western districts of\r\nColumbia,[1342] and are usually imported in short flattish fragments,\r\nor broken quills, of brownish rather than orange colour, mostly covered\r\nwith a dull greyish or internally reddish cork. The middle cortical\r\nlayer exhibits but few thick-walled cells; the liber is traversed by\r\nvery wide medullary rays, and is provided with but a small number of\r\nwidely scattered liber-fibres, which are rather thinner than in most\r\nother Cinchona barks. The Pitayo barks are usually rich in alkaloids,\r\nquinine prevailing. _Cinchona pitayensis_ is one of the hardiest\r\nspecies of the valuable Cinchonas, and is therefore particularly\r\nsuitable for cultivation, which however has not yet been carried out as\r\nlargely as that of either _C. officinalis_ or _C. succirubra_.\r\n\r\nIn the Conspectus on the next page, we have arranged the principal\r\nspecies of _Cinchona_, with short indications of the barks which some\r\nof them afford.[1343]\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The first examination of the minute structure\r\nof Cinchona barks is due to Weddell, whose observations have been\r\nrecorded in one of his beautiful plates published in 1849.[1344] Since\r\nthat time numerous other observers have laboured in the same field of\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n_General Characters._—These barks, as contrasted with those of other\r\ntrees, do not exhibit any great peculiarities of structure; and\r\ntheir features may be comprehended in the following statements. The\r\n_epidermis_, in the anatomical sense, occurs only in the youngest\r\nbarks, which are not found in commerce. The _corky layer_, which\r\nreplaces the epidermis, is constructed of the usual tabular cells. In\r\nsome species as _C. Calisaya_, it separates easily, at least in the\r\nolder bark, whereas in others as _C. succirubra_, the bark even of\r\ntrunks is always coated with it. In several species the corky tissue is\r\nnot only found on the surface, but strips of it occur also in the inner\r\nsubstance of the bark. In this case the portions of tissue external\r\nto the inner corky layers or bands are thrown off as _bork-scales_\r\n(_periderm_ of Weddell). This peculiar form of suberous tissue[1345]\r\nwas first examined (not in cinchona) in 1845 by H. von Mohl, who called\r\nit _rhytidoma_ (_Borke_ of the Germans). In _C. Calisaya_ it is of\r\nconstant occurrence, but not so usually in _C. succirubra_ and some\r\nothers; the rhytidoma therefore affords a good means of distinguishing\r\nseveral barks.\r\n\r\nThe inner portion of the bark exhibits a _middle_ or _primary layer_\r\n(_mesophlœum_),[1346] made up of parenchyme; and a second inner layer\r\nor _liber_ (_endophlœum_)[1347] displaying a much more complicated\r\nstructure. The primary layer disappears if rhytidoma is formed: barks\r\nin which this is the case are therefore at last exclusively composed of\r\nliber, of which Flat Calisaya Bark is a good example.\r\n\r\n[1342] Pitayo is an Indian village eastward of Popayan; see map of the\r\ncountry between Pasto and Bogotá in Blue Book (East India Chinchona\r\nPlant) 1866. 257.\r\n\r\n[1343] Two species included by Weddell in his _Notes sur les\r\nQuinquinas_, namely _C. Chomeliana_ Wedd. and _C. barbacoensis_ Karst.,\r\nhave been omitted, as not in our opinion belonging to the genus.\r\n\r\n[1344] _Hist. nat. des Quinquinas_, tab. ii.\r\n\r\n[1345] Flückiger, _Grundlagen_, Berlin, 1872. 61. fig. 48.\r\n\r\n[1346] _Enveloppe ou tunique cellulaire_ of Weddell; _Mittelrinde_ of\r\nthe Germans.\r\n\r\n[1347] In German _Bast_, or _Phloëm_ of modern German botany.\r\n\r\n                 CONSPECTUS OF THE PRINCIPAL SPECIES OF CINCHONA.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------+----------------+-------------+------\r\n   SPECIES (EXCLUDING SUB-SPECIES  |                |             | WHERE\r\n           AND VARIETIES)          | WHERE FIGURED. |   NATIVE    | CULTI-\r\n        ACCORDING TO WEDDELL.      |                |  COUNTRY.   | VATED.\r\n  ---------------------------------+----------------+-------------+-------\r\n  I.

The liber is separated by the medullary rays\r\ninto wedges,[1348] which are constituted of a parenchymatous part and\r\nof yellow or orange fibres. The number, colour, shape, and size, but\r\nchiefly the arrangement of these fibres, confer a certain character\r\ncommon to all the barks of the group under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe liber-fibres[1349] are elongated and bluntly pointed at their ends,\r\nbut never branched, mostly spindle-shaped, straight or slightly curved,\r\nand not exceeding in length 3 millimetres. They are consequently of\r\na simpler structure than the analogous cells of most other officinal\r\nbarks. They are about ¼ to ⅓ mm. thick, their transverse section\r\nexhibiting a quadrangular rather than a circular outline. Their walls\r\nare strongly thickened by numerous secondary deposits, the cavity\r\nbeing reduced to a narrow cleft, a structure which explains the\r\nbrittleness of the fibres. The liber-fibres are either irregularly\r\nscattered in the liber-rays, or they form radial lines transversely\r\nintersected by narrow strips of parenchyme, or they are densely packed\r\nin short bundles. It is a peculiarity of cinchona barks that these\r\nbundles consist always of a few fibres (3 to 5 or 7), whereas in many\r\nother barks (as cinnamon) analogous bundles are made up of a large\r\nnumber of fibres. Barks provided with long bundles of the latter kind\r\nacquire therefrom a very fibrous fracture, whilst cinchona barks from\r\ntheir short and simple fibres exhibit a short fracture. It is rather\r\ngranular in Calisaya bark, in which the fibres are almost isolated by\r\nparenchymatous tissue. In the bark of _C. scrobiculata_, a somewhat\r\nshort fibrous fracture[1350] is due to the arrangement of the fibres\r\nin radial rows. In _C. pubescens_, the fibres are in short bundles and\r\nproduce a rather woody fracture.\r\n\r\nBesides the liber-fibres, there are some other cells contributing to\r\nthe peculiarity of individual cinchona barks. This applies chiefly to\r\nthe _laticiferous ducts_ or _vessels_[1351] which are found in many\r\nsorts; they are scattered through the tissue intervening between the\r\nmiddle cortical layer and the liber, and consist of soft, elongated,\r\nunbranched cells, mostly exceeding in diameter the neighbouring\r\nparenchymatous cells.\r\n\r\nAs to the _contents of the tissue_ of cinchona barks, crystallized\r\nalkaloids are not visible. Howard has published figures representing\r\nminute rounded aggregations of crystalline matter in the cells, which\r\nhe supposes to be kinovates of the alkaloids; and also distinct\r\nacicular crystals which he holds to be of the same nature. These\r\nremarkable appearances are easily observable, yet only after sections\r\nof the bark have been boiled for a minute in weak caustic alkali\r\nand then washed with water; it may well be doubted whether they are\r\nstrictly natural. The liquids which are capable of dissolving the\r\nalkaloids in the free state do not afford any if they are applied to\r\nthe barks. The alkaloids being contained in the bark in the form of\r\nsalts, the latter are decomposed by caustic lye, and the alkaloids set\r\nat liberty assume the crystallized state. This is in our opinion the\r\norigin of the crystals under notice.\r\n\r\n[1348] _Baststrahlen_ or _Phloëmstrahlen_ of the Germans.\r\n\r\n[1349] _Fibres corticales_ of Weddell; _Baströhren_ or _Bastzellen_ in\r\nGerman.\r\n\r\n[1350] _Fracture filandreuse_, Weddel; _fädiger Bruch_ of the Germans.\r\n\r\n[1351] _Vaisseaux laticifères_ of Weddell; _Milchsaftschläuche_ in\r\nGerman.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the parenchymatous cells are loaded with small\r\nstarch granules, or in young and fresh barks with chlorophyll. In\r\nseveral barks, as in that of _C. lancifolia_ Mutis, numerous cells of\r\nthe middle cortical layer and even of the medullary rays, are provided\r\nwith somewhat thick walls, and contain either a soft brown mass or\r\ncrystalline oxalate of calcium. These cells have therefore been called\r\n_resin-cells_ and _crystal-cells_; they are mostly isolated, not\r\nforming extensive groups or zones, and their walls are not strongly\r\nthickened as in true sclerenchymatous tissue. If thin sections of\r\nthe barks are moistened with dilute alcoholic perchloride of iron,\r\nthe walls of the cells, except the fibres and the cork, assume a\r\nblackish-green due to cincho-tannic acid; this applies even to the\r\nstarch granules.\r\n\r\n_Characters of particular sorts._—The modifications of general\r\nstructure just described, are sufficient to impart a special character\r\nto the bark of many species of Cinchona, provided the bark is examined\r\nat its full development, the structural peculiarities being far from\r\nwell-marked in young barks.\r\n\r\nThus it is not possible to point out any distinctive features for\r\nthe _Loxa Bark_ of commerce, because it is mostly taken from young\r\nwood. We may say of it, that neither resin-cells nor crystal-cells\r\noccur in its middle layer, that its laticiferous vessels become soon\r\nobliterated, and have indeed disappeared in the older quills; and that\r\nthe liber-fibres form interrupted, not very regular, radial rows.\r\n\r\nThe quills of _C. Calisaya_ display large laticiferous ducts, which\r\nare wanting in the flat bark. There is a peculiar sort of the latter\r\ncalled _Bolivian Calisaya_ (already mentioned at p. 353), the flat\r\npieces of which still possess very obvious laticiferous vessels. As to\r\nthe liber-fibres of Calisaya bark, they are, as before stated (p. 356),\r\nscattered throughout the parenchymatous tissue or endophlœum. In the\r\nbark of _C. scrobiculata_, which might at first sight be confounded\r\nwith Calisaya bark, the liber-fibres form radial, less interrupted\r\nrows. The microscope affords therefore the means of distinguishing\r\nthese two barks.\r\n\r\nThe barks of _C. succirubra_ are particularly rich in laticiferous\r\nducts, mostly of considerable diameter, in which the formation of new\r\nparenchyme may not unfrequently be observed. The orange liber-fibres\r\noccurring in this bark are less numerous, more scattered, and of\r\nsmaller size than in Calisaya. The fracture of Red Bark, especially the\r\nflat sort, is therefore more finely granular and not so coarse as that\r\nof Calisaya.\r\n\r\nThe structural characters of Cinchona barks may lastly be fully\r\nappreciated by examining barks of the allied genera _Buena_,\r\n_Cascarilla_ and _Ladenbergia_, which were formerly known under\r\nthe name of _False Cinchona Barks_. The microscope shows that the\r\nliber-fibres of the latter are soft, branched and long, densely\r\npacked into large bundles, imparting therefore a well-marked fibrous\r\nstructure. The external appearance of these barks is widely different\r\nfrom that of true cinchona barks; none of them it would appear is now\r\ncollected for the purpose of adulteration.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most important and at the same time\r\npeculiar principles of Cinchona bark are the _Alkaloids_,—enumerated in\r\nthe following table:—[1352]\r\n\r\n    Cinchonine                                    C₂₀H₂₄N₂O.\r\n                or, as proposed by Skraup (1878)  C₁₉H₂₂N₂O.\r\n    Cinchonidine (_Quinidine_ of many writers)    same formula.\r\n    Quinine                                       C₂₀H₂₄N₂O₂.\r\n    Quinidine (_Conquinine_ of Hesse)             same formula.\r\n    Quinamine                                     C₁₉H₂₄N₂O₂.\r\n    Conquinamine (_Conchinamine_)                 same formula.\r\n\r\nB. A. Gomes[1353] of Lisbon (1810) first succeeded in obtaining active\r\nprinciples of cinchona, by treating an alcoholic extract of the bark\r\nwith water, adding to the solution caustic potash, and crystallizing\r\nthe precipitate from alcohol. The basic properties of the substance\r\nthus obtained, which Gomes called _Cinchonino_, were observed in the\r\nlaboratory of Thénard by Houtou-Labillardière, and communicated to\r\nPelletier and Caventou.[1354] Shortly before that time, Sertürner had\r\nasserted the existence of organic alkalis: and the French chemists,\r\nguided by that brilliant discovery, were enabled to show that the\r\n_Cinchonino_ of Gomes belonged to the same class of substances.\r\nPelletier and Caventou, however, speedily pointed out that it consisted\r\nof two distinct alkaloids, one of which they named _Quinine_, the\r\nother _Cinchonine_. In 1827 the Institut de France awarded to the two\r\nchemists for their discovery the Montyon prize of 10,000 francs (see\r\npage 57, note 4).\r\n\r\n[1352] Hesse, in 1877, pointed out the existence of a series of\r\nnew alkaloids existing in Cinchona. We refrain from repeating his\r\nstatements, which will be found abstracted in the _Yearbook of Pharm._\r\n1878. 63.\r\n\r\n[1353] Ensaio sobre o Cinchonino, e sobre sua influencia na virtude da\r\nquina e d’outras cascas.—_Mem. da Acad. R. das Sciencias de Lisboa_,\r\niii. (1812) 202-217.\r\n\r\n[1354] _Ann. de Chim. et de Phys._ xv. (1820) 292.\r\n\r\n_Cinchonidine_ (thus called by Pasteur in 1853) was first obtained and\r\ncharacterized under the name of _Quinidine_ in 1847, by F. L. Winckler\r\nof Darmstadt, from Maracaibo Bark (_C. tucujensis_ Karst.); and in\r\n1852 it was more closely studied by Leers, still under the name of\r\n_quinidine_.\r\n\r\n_Cinchovatine_, formerly stated to be a peculiar alkaloid, has been\r\nshown by Hesse in 1876 to agree with cinchonidine.\r\n\r\n_Quinidine_ is the name applied by Henry and Delondre to an alkaloid\r\nthey obtained in 1833; its peculiar nature was not clearly proved\r\nuntil 1853, when Pasteur examined it, and 1857 when De Vry showed its\r\nidentity with the _Beta-quinine_ extracted in 1849 by Van Heijningnen\r\nfrom commercial quinoidin. The name _quinidine_ having been since\r\napplied to different basic substances more or less pure, Hesse (1865)\r\nhas proposed to replace it by that of _Conquinine_ (Conchinin in\r\nGerman). The alkaloid is especially characteristic of the Pitayo barks,\r\nand also occurs in the Calisaya barks from Java.\r\n\r\n_Quinamine_ was discovered in 1872 by Hesse, in bark of _C. succirubra_\r\ncultivated at Darjiling in British Sikkim; it is also of common\r\noccurrence in the barks collected in Java. _Conquinamine_ was extracted\r\nin 1873 by Hesse from old barks from British India.\r\n\r\n_Paricine_ is another basic substance discovered in 1845 by Winckler,\r\nin the bark of _Buena hexandra_ Pohl. Hesse detected it along with\r\nquinamine in the bark of _C. succirubra_; its composition is not yet\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n_Aricine_, C₂₃H₂₆N₂O₄, and _Cusconine_, C₂₃H₂₆N₂O₄ + 2 OH₂, occur in\r\nthe so-called false Cinchona barks of not ascertained botanic origin.\r\nThese alkaloids differ in many respects from those of true Cinchona\r\nbarks.[1355]\r\n\r\n_Pitoyine_ was pointed out by Peretti (1837), but Hesse has shown\r\n(1873) that the bark called _China bicolorata Tecamez_[1356] or _Pitoya\r\nBark_ from which it was obtained, is altogether destitute of alkaloid.\r\n\r\nLastly may be mentioned _Paytine_, C₂₁H₂₄N₂O + OH₂, a crystallizable\r\nalkaloid discovered in 1870 by Hesse in a white bark of uncertain\r\norigin.[1357] It is allied to quinamine and quinidine, but has not been\r\nmet with in any known cinchona bark.\r\n\r\nBy heating for a length of time solutions of the cinchona alkaloids\r\nwith an excess of some mineral acid, Pasteur (1753) obtained amorphous\r\nmodifications of the natural bases. Quinine thus afforded _Quinicine_,\r\nhaving the same composition; cinchonine and cinchonidine furnished\r\n_Cinchonicine_, likewise agreeing in composition with the alkaloids\r\nfrom which it originates. These amorphous products may also be obtained\r\nby heating the natural bases in glycerin at 200° C., when a red\r\nsubstance is also formed. In quinine manufactories, amorphous alkaloids\r\nare constantly met with, being partly produced in the course of the\r\nmanipulations to which the materials are subjected. Yet cinchona barks\r\nalso afford _amorphous alkaloids_ at the very outset of analysis,\r\nwhence we must infer their existence in the living plant.\r\n\r\nThe name _Quinoidine_ (or rather “_Chinioïdin_”) was applied by\r\nSertürner (1829) to an uncrystallizable basic substance, which he\r\nprepared from cinchona barks, and found to be a peculiar alkaloid. The\r\nterm has subsequently been bestowed upon a preparation which has found\r\nits way into commerce and medical practice, in the form of a dark brown\r\nbrittle extractiform mass, softening below 100° C., and having usually\r\na slight alkaline reaction. It is obtained in quinine factories by\r\nprecipitating the brown mother-liquors with ammonia, and contains the\r\namorphous alkaloids naturally occurring in the barks. Quinoidin should\r\nnot be used unless, when previously dried at 100°, it proves to afford\r\nat least 70 per cent. of alkaloids soluble in ether.\r\n\r\nQuinine and the allied alkaloids have not been met with in any\r\nappreciable amount in other parts of the cinchonas than the bark, nor\r\nhas their presence been ascertained in other plants than those of the\r\ntribe _Cinchoneæ_.\r\n\r\n[1355] _Yearbook of Pharm._ 1878. 59.\r\n\r\n[1356] So called from Tecamez or Tacames, a small port of Ecuador\r\nin about lat. 1° N. The bark which was first noticed in Lambert’s\r\n_Description of the Genus Cinchona_, 1797. 30. tab. ii., is of unknown\r\nbotanical origin. In its external appearance, as well as in its\r\nstructure, this bark is widely different from any Cinchona bark.—See\r\nalso Vogl, in the second pamphlet quoted at page 391. 10; Oberlin and\r\nSchlagdenhauffen, _Journ. de Pharm._ 28. (1878) 252.\r\n\r\n[1357] Flückiger in Wiggers and Husemann, _Jahresbericht_ for 1872. 132.\r\n\r\nCharacters of the Cinchona Alkaloids.\r\n\r\n1. _Quinine._—It is obtained from alcoholic solutions, in prisms of\r\nthe composition C₂₀H₂₄N₂O₂ + 3 OH₂, fusing at 57° C. The crystals may\r\nbe deprived of water by warming or exposure over oil of vitriol, and\r\nthey fuse at 177° C. The anhydrous alkaloid is likewise crystallizable;\r\nit requires about 21 parts of ether for solution, but dissolves more\r\nreadily in chloroform or absolute alcohol. These solutions deviate the\r\nray of polarized light to the left, and so do likewise solutions of the\r\nsalts of quinine. Yet one and the same quantity of alkaloid exhibits\r\na very different rotatory power according to the solvent used, though\r\nthe volume of the solution remain the same. Even the common sulphate\r\ndiffers in this respect from the two other sulphates of quinine. The\r\nsame remark applies to the optical power of the other alkaloids.\r\n\r\nIf ten volumes of a solution of quinine, or of one of its salts, are\r\nmixed in a test tube with one volume of chlorine water, and a drop\r\nof ammonia is added, a brilliant green colour makes its appearance.\r\nIn solutions rich in quinine, a green precipitate, _Thalleioquin_ or\r\n_Dalleiochine_ is produced; in solutions containing less than ¹/₁₀₀₀\r\nof quinine, no precipitate is formed, but the fluid assumes a green\r\neven more beautiful than in a stronger solution. The test succeeds\r\nwith a solution containing only one part of quinine in 5,000, and in a\r\nsolution containing not more than ¹/₂₀₀₀ of quinine, if bromine is used\r\ninstead of chlorine.[1358]\r\n\r\nThe bitter taste of quinine is not appreciable in solutions containing\r\nless than one part in 100,000. The blue fluorescence displayed by a\r\nsolution of quinine in dilute sulphuric acid is observable in solutions\r\ncontaining much less than one part in 200,000 of water; yet it is not\r\napparent in very strong solutions.\r\n\r\nBesides the _common medicinal_ sulphate, 2 C₂₀H₂₄N₂O₂ + SO₄H₂ + 8 OH₂,\r\nquinine forms two other crystallizable sulphates, namely the sulphate,\r\nC₂₀H₂₄N₂O₂ + SO₄H₂ + 7 OH₂, and a third having the composition\r\nC₂₀H₂₄N₂O₂ + 2 SO₄H₂ + 7 OH₂.\r\n\r\nHerapath, at Bristol, showed in 1852 that quinine forms with sulphuric\r\nacid and iodine a peculiar compound, _Iodo-sulphate of Quinine_,\r\nhaving the composition (C₂₀H₂₄N₂O₂)₄ + 3 (SO₄H₂) + 2 HI + 4 I + 3\r\nOH₂. As this substance possesses optical properties analogous to\r\nthose of tourmaline, it was called by Haidinger, _Herapathite_. It\r\nmay be easily obtained by dissolving sulphate of quinine in 10 parts\r\nof weak spirit of wine containing 5 per cent. of sulphuric acid, and\r\nadding an alcoholic solution of iodine until a black precipitate is no\r\nlonger formed. This precipitate is collected on a filter and washed\r\nwith alcohol; then dissolved in boiling spirit of wine and allowed\r\nto crystallize. The tabular crystals thus obtained are extremely\r\nremarkable on account of their dichroism and polarizing power, as well\r\nas for the sparing solubility, since they require 1000 parts of boiling\r\nwater for solution; their sparing solubility in cold alcohol may be\r\nutilized for separating quinine from the other cinchona alkaloids and\r\nestimating its quantity.\r\n\r\n2. _Quinidine_ or _Conquinine_—forms crystals having the composition,\r\nC₂₀H₂₄N₂O₂ + 2 OH₂; the anhydrous alkaloid melts at 168° C., and\r\nrequires about 30 parts of ether for solution. Its solutions are\r\nstrongly dextrogyre; it agrees with quinine as regards bitterness,\r\nfluorescence and the thalleioquin test, and forms a neutral and an\r\nacid sulphate. The most striking character of quinidine is afforded by\r\nits hydriodate, the crystals of which require for solution at 15° C.,\r\n1250 parts of water or 110 parts of alcohol sp. gr. ·834. Quinidine\r\nmay therefore be separated from the other alkaloids of bark by a\r\nsolution of iodide of potassium which will precipitate the hydriodate.\r\nAccording to Hesse (1873), quinidine is further characterized by the\r\nfact that its sulphate is soluble in 20 parts of chloroform at 15° C.,\r\nthe sulphates of the other cinchona alkaloids being far less soluble in\r\nthat liquid. The common medicinal sulphate of quinine, _e.g._, requires\r\nfor solution 1000 parts of chloroform.\r\n\r\n[1358] _Pharm. Journ._, May 11, 1872. 901.\r\n\r\n3. _Cinchonine._—This alkaloid forms crystals which are always\r\nanhydrous; they fuse at 257° C., and require about 400 parts of ether\r\nand 120 of spirit of wine for solution. Cinchonine further differs from\r\nquinine by its dextrogyre power, its want of fluorescence, and its\r\nnon-susceptibility to the thalleioquin test. Its hydriodate is readily\r\nsoluble in water, and still more so in alcohol whether dilute or strong.\r\n\r\n4. _Cinchonidine._—forms anhydrous crystals melting at 206° C., soluble\r\nin 76 parts of ether, or 20 of spirit of wine, then affording levogyre\r\nliquids, devoid of fluorescence, and not acquiring a green colour\r\n(thalleioquin) by means of chlorine water and ammonia. Hydrochlorate of\r\ncinchonidine forms pyramidal crystals of the monoclinic system, very\r\ndifferent from the hydrochlorates of the allied alkaloids.\r\n\r\n5. _Quinamine._—The crystals are anhydrous, fuse at 172° C., and form\r\nat a temp. of 20°, with 32 parts of ether or 100 parts of spirit of\r\nwine, a dextrogyre solution. Quinamine is even to some extent soluble\r\nin boiling water, and abundantly in boiling ether, benzol, or petroleum\r\nether. The solutions of quinamine do not stand the thalleioquin test,\r\nnor do they display fluorescence; in acid solution, the alkaloid\r\nis liable to be transformed into an amorphous state. Quinamine\r\nmoistened with concentrated nitric acid, assumes like paytine a yellow\r\ncoloration. Its hydriodate is readily soluble in boiling water, but\r\nvery sparingly in cold water, especially in presence of iodide of\r\npotassium, in which respect it is allied to quinidine as well as to\r\npaytine.\r\n\r\nThe more important properties of the Cinchona alkaloids may be\r\nsummarized as follows:—\r\n\r\n    a.  _Hydrated_ crystals are formed by\r\n                                   Quinine, Quinidine, (or Conquinine).\r\n        _No hydrated_ crystals by\r\n                                   Cinchonine, Cinchonidine, Quinamine.\r\n\r\n    b.  _Abundantly_ soluble in ether\r\n                                      Quinine, Quinidine, Quinamine,\r\n                                      and the amorphous alkaloids.\r\n        _Sparingly_ soluble in ether  Cinchonidine.\r\n        _Almost insoluble_ in ether   Cinchonine.\r\n\r\n    c.  _Levogyre_ solutions afforded by\r\n                                      Quinine, Cinchonidine.\r\n        _Dextrogyre_ solutions by\r\n                            Cinchonine, Quinidine, Quinamine,\r\n                            Conquinamine, and the amorphous alkaloids.\r\n\r\n    d.  Thalleioquin is formed by\r\n                             Quinine, Quinidine, and also by Quinicine.\r\n        Thalleioquin cannot be obtained from\r\n                                  Cinchonine, Cinchonidine, Quinamine,\r\n                                  nor from Cinchonicine.\r\n\r\n    e.  Fluorescence is displayed by solutions of Quinine, Quinidine.\r\n        No fluorescence in solutions of pure Cinchonine, Cinchonidine,\r\n             Quinamine.\r\n\r\n=Proportion of Alkaloids in Cinchona Barks=—This is liable to very\r\ngreat variation. We know from the experiments of Hesse (1871), that\r\nthe bark of _C. pubescens_ Vahl is sometimes devoid of alkaloid.[1359]\r\nSimilar observations made near Bogota upon _C. pitayensis_ Wedd., _C.\r\ncorymbosa_ Karst., and _C. lancifolia_ Mutis, are due to Karsten. He\r\nascertained[1360] that barks of one district were sometimes devoid of\r\nquinine, while those of the same species from a neighbouring locality\r\nyielded 3½ to 4½ per cent. of sulphate of quinine.\r\n\r\n[1359] _Berichte der Deutschen Chem. Gesellschaft zu Berlin_, 1871. 818.\r\n\r\n[1360] _Die medicinischen Chinarinden Neu-Granada’s_, 17. 20. 39.\r\n\r\nAnother striking example is furnished by De Vry[1361] in his\r\nexamination of quills of _C. officinalis_ grown at Ootacamund, which\r\nhe found to vary in percentage of alkaloids, from 11·96 (of which 9·1\r\nper cent. was quinine) down to less than 1 per cent. An extremely\r\nremarkable variation has also been displayed, as already alluded to at\r\np. 351, by Ledger’s Calisaya.\r\n\r\nAmong the innumerable published analyses of cinchona bark, there\r\nare a great number showing but a very small percentage of the\r\nuseful principles, of which quinine, the most valuable of all, is\r\nnot seldom altogether wanting. The highest yield on the other hand\r\nhitherto observed, was obtained by Broughton[1362] from a bark grown\r\nat Ootacamund. This bark afforded not less than 13½ per cent. of\r\nalkaloids, among which quinine was predominant. In Java too, Cinchona\r\nLedgeriana (see pp. 341, 351) has proved since to afford much more\r\nalkaloid than any American barks; as much as 13·25 per cent. of quinine\r\nhave been observed in its bark.\r\n\r\nThe few facts just mentioned show that it is impossible to state even\r\napproximately any constant percentage of alkaloids in any given bark.\r\nWe may however say that good _Flat Calisaya Bark_, as offered in the\r\ndrug trade for pharmaceutical preparations, contains at least 5 to 6\r\nper cent. of quinine.\r\n\r\nAs to _Crown_ or _Loxa Bark_, the _Cortex Cinchonæ pallidæ_ of\r\npharmacy, its merits are, to say the least, very uncertain. On its\r\nfirst introduction in the 17th century, when it was taken from the\r\ntrunks and large branches of full-grown trees, it was doubtless an\r\nexcellent medicinal bark; but the same cannot be said of much of that\r\nnow found in commerce, which is to a large extent collected from very\r\nyoung wood.[1363] Some of the Crown Bark produced in India is however\r\nof extraordinary excellence, as shown by the recent experiments of De\r\nVry.[1364]\r\n\r\nAs to _Red Bark_, the thick flat sort contains only 3 to 4 per cent. of\r\nalkaloids, but a large amount of coloring matter. The quill Red Bark of\r\nthe Indian plantations is a much better drug, some of it yielding 5 to\r\n10 per cent. of alkaloids, less than a third of which is quinine and a\r\nfourth cinchonidine, the remainder being cinchonine and sometimes also\r\ntraces of quinidine (conquinine).\r\n\r\nThe variations in the amount of alkaloids relates not merely to their\r\ntotal percentage, but also to the proportion which one bears to\r\nanother. Quinine and cinchonine are of the most frequent occurrence;\r\ncinchonidine is less usual, while quinidine is still less frequently\r\nmet with and never in large amount. The experiments performed in\r\nIndia[1365] have already shown that external influences contribute in\r\nan important manner to the formation of this or that alkaloid; and\r\nit may even be hoped that the cultivators of cinchona will discover\r\nmethods of promoting the formation of quinine and of reducing, if not\r\nof excluding, that of the less valuable alkaloids.\r\n\r\n[1361] _Pharm. Journ._ Sept. 6, 1873. 181.\r\n\r\n[1362] Blue Book—“_East India Chinchona Plant_,” 1870. 282; _Yearbook\r\nof Pharmacy_, 1871. 85.\r\n\r\n[1363] See Howard’s analyses and observations, _Pharm. Journ._ xiv.\r\n(1855) 61-63.\r\n\r\n[1364] _Pharm. Journ._ Sept. 6, 1873. 184.\r\n\r\n[1365] Blue Book, 1870. 116. 188. 205.\r\n\r\nMost salts of the alkaloids of cinchona afford a beautiful purple tar\r\nwhen they are heated in a test tube, and the same is also produced with\r\nthe powdered bark, provided alkaloids be present. No other bark, as\r\nfar as we know, yields a similar product of the dry distillation. It\r\nis not observed even in using true Cinchona barks, which are devoid of\r\nalkaloids. This method for ascertaining the presence of alkaloids in\r\nCinchona barks has been proposed in 1858 by Grahe of Kasan. Hesse has\r\nimproved Grahe’s test in the following way: he extracts the powdered\r\nbark with slightly acidulated water and dries up the liquid with a\r\nlittle of the powder. _Grahe’s test_ at once shows whether a given bark\r\ncontains Cinchona alkaloids or not.\r\n\r\n=Acid principles of Cinchona Barks=—Count Claude de la Garaye[1366]\r\nobserved (1746) a crystalline salt deposited in extract of cinchona\r\nbark, which salt was known for some time in France as _Sel essential\r\nde la Garaye_. Hermbstädt at Berlin (1785) showed it to be a salt of\r\ncalcium, the peculiarity of whose acid was pointed out in 1790 by\r\nC. A. Hoffmann,[1367] an apothecary of Leer in Hanover, who termed\r\nit _Chinasäure_. The composition of this substance, which is the\r\n_Kinic Acid_ of English chemists, was ascertained by Liebig in 1830\r\nto be C₇H₁₂O₆, or now C₆H₇(OH)₄COOH. The acid forms large monoclinic\r\nprisms, fusible at 162° C., of a strong and pure acid taste, soluble\r\nin two parts of water, also in spirit of wine, but hardly in ether.\r\nThe solutions are levogyre. Kinic acid appears to be present in every\r\nspecies, and also to occur in barks of allied genera; and in fact to\r\nbe of somewhat wide distribution in the vegetable kingdom. By heating\r\nit or a kinate, interesting derivatives are obtained; thus, by means\r\nof peroxide of manganese and sulphuric acid, we get yellow crystals\r\nof _Kinone_ or _Quinone_, C₆H₄O₂,—a reaction which may be used for\r\nascertaining the presence of kinic acid. Kinic acid is devoid of any\r\nnoteworthy physiological action.\r\n\r\n_Cincho-tannic Acid_—is precipitated from a decoction of bark by\r\nacetate of lead, after the decoction has been freed from cinchona-red\r\nby means of magnesia. Dr. de Vry informed us that the Indian barks\r\nare usually richer in cincho-tannic acid; their cold infusion becomes\r\nturbid on addition of hydrochloric acid, which forms an insoluble\r\ncompound with the former.\r\n\r\nThe cincho-tannate of lead decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen, and\r\nthe solution cautiously evaporated _in vacuo_, yields the acid as an\r\namorphous, hygroscopic substance, readily soluble in water, alcohol, or\r\nether. The solutions, especially in presence of an alkali, are quickly\r\ndecomposed, a red flocculent matter, _Cinchona-red_, being produced.\r\nSolutions of cincho-tannic acid assume a greenish colour on addition of\r\na ferric salt. By destructive distillation, cincho-tannic acid affords\r\npyrocatechin.\r\n\r\n_Quinovic_ (or _Chinovic_) _Acid_, C₂₄H₃₈O₄, crystallizes in hexagonal\r\nscales which are sparingly soluble in cold alcohol, more readily in\r\nboiling alcohol, but not dissolved by water, ether, or chloroform. It\r\noccurs in cinchona barks, and has been met with by Rembold (1868) in\r\nthe rhizome of _Potentilla Tormentilla_ Sibth.\r\n\r\n[1366] _Chimie hydraulique_, Paris, 1746. 114.\r\n\r\n[1367] Crell’s _Chem. Annalen_, 1790, ii. 314-317.\r\n\r\n=Other Constituents of Cinchona Barks=—Quinovic acid is accompanied by\r\n_Quinovin_ (or _Chinovin_), C₃₀H₄₈O₈, an amorphous bitter substance,\r\nfirst obtained (1821) by Pelletier and Caventou under the name of\r\n_Kinovic Acid_, from _China nova_,[1368] in which it occurs combined\r\nwith lime. Quinovin in alcoholic solution was shown in 1859 by\r\nHlasiwetz to be resolved by means of hydrochloric gas into quinovic\r\nacid, C₂₄H₃₈O₄, and an uncrystallizable sugar, _Mannitan_, C₆H₁₂O₅,\r\nwith subtraction of H₂O. The formation of quinovic acid takes place\r\nmore easily, if quinovin is placed in contact with sodium amalgam and\r\nspirit of wine, when, after 12 hours, mannitan and quinovate of sodium\r\nare formed (Rochleder, 1867).\r\n\r\nQuinovin, although an indifferent substance, may be removed from\r\ncinchona barks by weak caustic soda, from which it is precipitable by\r\nhydrochloric acid, together with quinovic acid and cinchona-red. Milk\r\nof lime then dissolves quinovin and quinovic acid, but not the red\r\nsubstance. Quinovic acid and quinovin again precipitated by an acid,\r\nmay be separated by chloroform in which the latter only is soluble, or\r\nalso by cold dilute alcohol sp. gr. about 0·926, quinovin being readily\r\nremoved by this liquid.\r\n\r\nQuinovin dissolves in boiling water; its solutions, as well as those of\r\nquinovic acid, are dextrogyre. Quinovin seems to be a constituent of\r\nalmost every part of the cinchonas and the allied _Cinchoneæ_, although\r\nthe amount of it in barks does not apparently exceed 2 per cent. It is\r\naccompanied by quinovic acid: both substances are stated to have tonic\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n_Cinchona-red_, an amorphous substance to which the red hue of\r\ncinchona barks is due, is produced as shown by Rembold (1867), when\r\ncincho-tannic acid is boiled with dilute sulphuric acid, sugar\r\nbeing formed at the same time. By fusing cinchona-red with potash,\r\nprotocatechuic acid, C₇H₆O₄, is produced. Cinchona-red is sparingly\r\nsoluble in alcohol, abundantly in alkaline solutions, but neither in\r\nwater nor in ether. Thick Red Bark in which it is abundant, affords it\r\nto the extent of over 10 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe Cinchona barks yield but a scanty percentage of ash, not exceeding\r\n3 per cent., a fact well according with the small amount they contain\r\nof oxalate and kinate of calcium.\r\n\r\n=Estimation of the Alkaloids in Cinchona Bark=—The microscope will\r\nenable us, as already shown, to ascertain whether a given bark is\r\nderived from _Cinchona_, but it can furnish no exact information as to\r\nthe actual value of such bark as a drug.\r\n\r\nYet there is a very simple test by which the presence of a\r\ncinchona-alkaloid may be demonstrated. These alkaloids heated in a\r\nglass tube in the presence of a volatile acid or of substances capable\r\nof producing a volatile acid, evolve heavy vapours of a beautiful\r\ncrimson colour, as mentioned p. 363.\r\n\r\n[1368] The bark of _Buena magnifolia_ Wedd., a tree with fragrant\r\nflowers and magnificent foliage, figured in Howard’s “_Nueva Quinologia\r\nof Pavon_” as Cinchona magnifolia. Its bark is destitute of alkaloids;\r\nit also used to appear occasionally in the London market since about\r\nthe year 1820.—See also our article on _Cortex Cascarillæ_.\r\n\r\nBut to ascertain the real value of a cinchona bark, a quantitative\r\nestimation of the alkaloids is necessary. A good process for this\r\noperation has been given by De Vry.[1369] It is as follows:—Mix 20\r\ngrammes of powdered bark, dried at 100° C., with milk of lime (5 grm.\r\nslaked lime to 50 grm. water), dry the mixture slowly; by stirring\r\nit frequently, the cincho-tannic acid loses its solubility, being\r\ngradually transformed into cinchona-red. Then boil the dry powder with\r\n200 cubic centimetres of alcohol 0·830 sp. gr. Pour the liquid on to a\r\nsmall filter, and afterwards the residual bark and lime mixed with 100\r\ncub. cent. more alcohol. Wash the powder on the filter with 100 cub.\r\ncent. of spirit From the mixed liquids, about 370 cub. cent., separate\r\nthe calcium by a few drops of weak sulphuric acid. Filter, distill off\r\nthe spirit and pour into a capsule the residual liquid,—to which add a\r\nsmall quantity of spirit and water with which the distilling apparatus\r\nhas been rinsed out. Let the capsule be now heated on a water-bath\r\nuntil all the spirit shall have been expelled; and let the remaining\r\nliquor which contains all the alkaloids in the form of acid sulphates\r\nbe filtered. There will remain on the filter quinovic acid and fatty\r\nsubstances, which must be washed with slightly acidulated water. The\r\nfiltrate and washings reduced to about 50 cub. cent., should be treated\r\nwhile still warm with caustic soda in excess. After cooling, this is\r\ndecanted off from the precipitate, and then water added to it before\r\nthrowing it on to a filter. It is then to be washed with the smallest\r\nquantity of water pressed between folds of blotting paper, removed\r\ntherefrom and dried. The weight multiplied by 5 will indicate the\r\npercentage of _mixed_ alkaloids in the bark.\r\n\r\n[1369] _Pharm. Journ._ iv. (1873) 241, and Dr. de Vry’s papers\r\nmentioned at the end of the present article, p. 369; also private\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\nTo separate the alkaloids from each other, treat the powdered mass\r\nwith ten times its weight of ether. This will resolve it into two\r\nportions—(a) _insoluble in ether_, (b) _soluble in ether_.\r\n\r\n(a.) This should be converted into neutral acetates, and to the\r\nsolution there should be added iodide of potassium, which will possibly\r\nseparate a little _quinidine_. After removal of the latter (if\r\npresent), add solution of tartrate of potassium and sodium, which will\r\nthrow down in a crystalline form tartrate of _cinchonidine_; from the\r\nmother-liquor, _cinchonine_ may be precipitated by caustic soda.\r\n\r\n(b.) The ether having been evaporated, the residue is to be dried at\r\n100° C. and weighed. It may in many cases practically be considered\r\nas consisting of quinine only. If however the estimation of quinidine\r\n(conquinine) and quinamine is required, the residue, or a determined\r\nportion of it, should be dissolved in acetic acid just as much as\r\nwill be necessary for affording a neutral solution. From this the\r\nhydroiodate of quinidine is precipitated by means of an alcoholic\r\nsolution of iodide of potassium. In the filtrate quinine may be\r\nprecipitated by adding a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid and an\r\nalcoholic tincture of iodine. The herapathite thus formed (see p. 360)\r\nis collected after a day, dried at 100° and weighed; it then contains\r\n55 per cent. of quinine.\r\n\r\nAfter adding a few drops of sulphurous acid, the alcohol should now be\r\nevaporated from the fluid from which the crystals of herapathite have\r\nbeen removed, and caustic lye added, by which the amorphous alkaloids\r\nwill be precipitated, including _quinamine_ if present.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Cinchona bark enjoys the reputation of being a most valuable\r\nremedy in fevers. But the uncertainty of its composition and its\r\ninconvenient bulk render it a far less eligible form of medicine than\r\nthe alkaloids themselves. It is nevertheless much used as a general\r\ntonic in various pharmaceutical preparations.\r\n\r\nAs to the alkaloids, the only one which is in general use is _quinine_.\r\nThe neglect of the others is a regrettable waste, which the result of\r\nrecent investigations ought to obviate. In the year 1866 the Madras\r\nGovernment appointed a Medical Commission to test the respective\r\nefficacy in the treatment of fever, of Quinine, Quinidine, Cinchonine\r\nand Cinchonidine. Of the sulphates of these alkaloids, a due supply,\r\nspecially prepared under Mr. Howard’s superintendence, was placed\r\nat the disposal of the Commission. From the report[1370] it appears\r\nthat the number of cases of paroxysmal malarious fevers treated was\r\n2472,—namely 846 with Quinine, 664 with Quinidine, 569 with Cinchonine,\r\nand 403 with Cinchonidine. Of these 2472 cases, 2445 were cured, and\r\n27 failed. The difference in remedial value of the four alkaloids, as\r\ndeduced from these experiments, may be thus stated:—\r\n\r\n    Quinidine—ratio of failure per 1000 cases treated   6\r\n    Quinine          ”           ”                       7\r\n    Cinchonidine     ”           ”                      10\r\n    Cinchonine       ”           ”                      23\r\n\r\nThe Indian Government, acting on the recommendation of Mr. Howard,\r\nhas officially advised (Dec. 16, 1873) the more free use India of\r\ncinchona alkaloids other than quinine, and especially of _sulphate of\r\ncinchonidine_, which is procurable in abundance from Red Bark.[1371]\r\nQuinidine on the other hand, which has proved the most valuable of all,\r\nis only obtainable from a few barks and in very limited amount.\r\n\r\nDr. de Vry since 1876 advocates the use of what he calls _Quinetum_.\r\nThis preparation is obtained by exhausting the barks with slightly\r\nacidulated water, and precipitating the whole amount of alkaloids by\r\ncaustic soda. In India the remedy is known as “the Febrifuge.”[1372]\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—There is not now any frequent importation of _spurious_\r\ncinchona barks, but the substitution of bad varieties for good is\r\nsufficiently common. To discriminate these in a positive manner by\r\nascertaining the percentage of quinine, which is the chief criterion\r\nof value, recourse must be had to chemical analysis, a method of\r\nperforming which has been described. Entirely worthless barks may be\r\neasily recognized by means of Grahe’s test (p. 363).\r\n\r\n[1370] Blue Book—_East India Cinchona Cultivation_, 1870. pp.\r\n156-172.—The report contains very interesting and important medical\r\ndetails.

Richard—This is a\r\nsmall shrub, 8 to 16 inches high, with an ascending, afterwards erect,\r\nsimple stem, and somewhat creeping root, growing socially in moist\r\nand shady forests of South America, lying between 8° and 22° S. lat.,\r\nespecially in the Brazilian provinces of Pará, Maranhão, Pernambuco,\r\nBahia, Espiritu Santo, Minas, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. Within the\r\nlast half century, it has been discovered in the vast interior province\r\nof Matto Grosso, chiefly in that part of it which forms the valley of\r\nthe Rio Paraguay. From information given to Weddell,[1374] it would\r\nseem probable that the plant extends beyond the frontiers of Brazil to\r\nthe Bolivian province of Chiquitos.\r\n\r\nThe root which is brought into commerce is furnished chiefly by the\r\nregion lying between the towns of Cuyabá, Villa Bella, Villa Maria, and\r\nDiamantina in the province of Matto Grosso; but to some extent also by\r\nthe woods in the neighbourhood of the German colony of Philadelphia on\r\nthe Rio Todos os Santos, a tributary of the Mucury, north of Rio de\r\nJaneiro.\r\n\r\nProf. Balfour of Edinburgh, who has paid much attention to the\r\npropagation of ipecacuanha, finds that the plant exists under two\r\nvarieties, of which he has published figures;[1375] they may be thus\r\ndistinguished:\r\n\r\n      _a._ Stem woody, leaves of firm texture, elliptic\r\n           or oval, wavy at the edges, with but few hairs on\r\n           surface and margin. Long in cultivation: origin unknown.\r\n\r\n      _b._ Stem herbaceous, leaves less firm in texture,\r\n           more hairy on margin, not wavy. Grows in the neighbourhood\r\n           of Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nThe plant cultivated in India seems disposed to run into several\r\nvarieties, but according to the experience gained in Edinburgh, the\r\ndiversity of form apparent in young plants tends to disappear with age.\r\n\r\n=History=—In an account of Brazil, written by a Portuguese friar, who,\r\nit would seem, had resided in that country from about 1570 to 1600, and\r\npublished by Purchas,[1376] mention is made of three remedies for the\r\nbloody flux, one of which is called _Igpecaya_ or _Pigaya_; the drug\r\nhere spoken of is probably that under notice.\r\n\r\n[1373] I am informed by my friend Professor Müller of Geneva that in\r\ndescribing the Rubiaceæ for the _Flora Brasiliensis_ he will include\r\nCephaëlis Ipecacuanha in the genus _Mapouria_.—F.

(1625),—a treatise of\r\nBrasill, written by a Portugall which had long lived there, p. 1311.\r\n\r\nPiso and Marcgraf[1377] in their scientific exploration of Brazil\r\nmet with two kinds of ipecacuanha; the one provided with a brown\r\nroot is Cephaëlis Ipecacuanha, which they figured. The root of the\r\nother variety, which they called _Ipecacuanha blanca_, is that of\r\nRichardsonia scabra (see page 376 below). Piso and Marcgraf described\r\nthe virtues of these roots, apparently supposing them to be much the\r\nsame as to their action. Although in common use in Brazil, ipecacuanha\r\nwas not employed in Europe prior to the year 1672. At that date, a\r\ntraveller named Legras brought from South America a quantity of the\r\nroot to Paris, some of which came into the possession of the “maître\r\nappoticaire” Claquenelle.[1378] It would appear that the root was\r\nprescribed from the latter by Legras (said to have been himself\r\nacquainted with the practice of medicine[1379]), and also by Jean\r\nAdrien Helvetius, a young Dutch physician, then living in Paris. Yet no\r\nsuccess at first was obtained, the drug being administered in too large\r\ndoses. In 1680, a merchant of Paris named Garnier became possessed of\r\n150 lb. of ipecacuanha, the valuable properties of which in dysentery\r\nhe vaunted to his medical attendant Afforty, and to Helvetius. Garnier\r\non his convalescence[1380] made a present of some of the new drug to\r\nAfforty, who attached to it but little importance. Helvetius, on the\r\nother hand, was induced to prescribe the root in cases of dysentery,\r\nwhich he did with the utmost success. It is stated by Eloy that\r\nHelvetius even caused placards to be affixed to the corners of the\r\nstreets (about the year 1686), announcing his successful treatment\r\nwith the new drug, supplies of which he obtained through Garnier from\r\nSpain, and sold as a secret medicine. The fame of the cures effected by\r\nHelvetius reached the French Court, and caused some trials of the drug\r\nto be made at the Hôtel Dieu. These having been fully successful, Louis\r\nXIV. accorded to Helvetius the sole right of vending his remedy.[1381]\r\nSubsequently several great personages, including the Dauphin of France,\r\nhaving experienced its benefit, the king consulted his physician,\r\nAntoine d’Aquin, and the well-known Jesuit Père François de Lachaise,\r\nwho had become the King’s confessor in 1675. Through them was chiefly\r\nnegotiated the purchase from Helvetius of his secret, for 1000 louis\r\nd’or, and made public in 1688. The right of Helvetius to this payment\r\nwas disputed in law by Garnier, but maintained by a decision of the\r\nChâtelet of Paris.[1382]\r\n\r\nThe botanical source of ipecacuanha was the subject of much dispute\r\nuntil finally settled by Antonio Bernardino Gomez, a physician of the\r\nPortuguese navy, who brought authentic specimens from Brazil to Lisbon\r\nin the year 1800.[1383]\r\n\r\n[1377] _Hist. nat.

(1801) 137.\r\n\r\n=Collection=[1384]—The ipecacuanha plant, _Poaya_ of the Brazilians,\r\ngrows in valleys, yet prefers spots which are rather too much raised\r\nto be inundated or swampy. Here it is found under the thick shade of\r\nancient trees growing mostly in clumps. In collecting the root, the\r\n_poayero_, for so the collector of _poaya_ is called, grasps in one\r\nhandful if he can, all the stems of a clump, pushing under it obliquely\r\ninto the soil a pointed stick to which he gives a see-saw motion. A\r\nlump of earth enclosing the roots is thus raised; and, if the operation\r\nhas been well performed, those of the whole clump are got up almost\r\nunbroken. The _poayero_ shakes off adhering soil, places the roots in a\r\nlarge bag which he carries with him, and goes on to seek other clumps.\r\nA good collector may thus get as much as 30 lb. of roots in the day;\r\nbut generally a daily gathering does not exceed 10 or 12 lb., and there\r\nare many who scarcely get 6 or 8 lb. In the rainy season, the ground\r\nbeing lighter, the roots are removed more easily than in dry weather.\r\nThe _poayeros_, who work in a sort of partnership, assemble in the\r\nevening, unite their gatherings, which having been weighed, are spread\r\nout to dig. Rapid drying is advantageous; the root is therefore exposed\r\nto sunshine as much as possible, and if the weather is favourable, it\r\nbecomes dry in two or three days. But it has always to be placed under\r\ncover at night on account of the dew. When quite dry, it is broken into\r\nfragments, and shaken in a sieve in order to separate adherent sand and\r\nearth, and finally it is packed in bales for transport.\r\n\r\nThe harvest goes on all the year round, but is relaxed a little during\r\nthe rains, on account of the difficulty of drying the produce. As\r\nfragments of the root grow most readily, complete extirpation of the\r\nplant in any one locality does not seem probable. The more intelligent\r\n_poayeros_ of Matto Grosso are indeed wise enough intentionally to\r\nleave small bits of root in the place whence a clump has been dug, and\r\neven to close over the opening in the soil.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation=—The importance in India of ipecacuanha as a remedy for\r\ndysentery, and the increasing costliness of the drug,[1385] have\r\noccasioned active measures to be taken for attempting its cultivation\r\nin that country. Though known for several years as a denizen of\r\nbotanical gardens, the ipecacuanha plant has always been rare, owing to\r\nits slow growth and the difficulty attending its propagation.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered in 1869 by McNab, curator of the Botanical Garden\r\nof Edinburgh, that if the annulated part of the root of a growing\r\nipecacuanha plant be cut into short pieces even only ¹/₁₆ of an inch\r\nthick, and placed in suitable soil, each piece will throw out a\r\nleaf-bud and become a separate plant. Lindsay, a gardener of the same\r\nestablishment, further proved that the petiole of the leaf is capable\r\nof producing roots and buds, a discovery which has been utilized in the\r\npropagation of the plant at the Rungbi Cinchona plantation in Sikkim.\r\n\r\n[1384] Abstracted from the interesting eye-witness account of Weddell,\r\n_l. c._\r\n\r\n[1385] The following are the average prices at which the drug was\r\npurchased wholesale, in London during three periods of ten years each:—\r\n\r\n10 years ending 1850, average price 2_s._ 9½_d._ per lb. 10 ” 1860, ”\r\n6_s._ 11½_d._ ” 10 ” 1870, ” 8_s._ 8¼_ d._ ”\r\n\r\nIn 1871, well-formed fruits were obtained from the ipecacuanha\r\nplants growing in the Edinburgh Botanical Garden: this was promoted\r\nby artificial fertilization, especially when the flowers of a plant\r\nproducing _long styles_ were fertilized with the pollen of one having\r\n_short_ styles,—for _Cephaëlis_ like _Cinchona_ has dimorphic flowers.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the acclimatization of the plant in India, much\r\ndifficulty has been encountered, and successful results are still\r\nproblematical. The first plant was taken to Calcutta by Dr. King in\r\n1866, and by 1868 had been increased to nine; but in 1870-71, it\r\nwas reported that, notwithstanding every care, the plants could not\r\nbe made to thrive. Three plants which had been sent to the Rungbi\r\nplantation in 1868, grew rather better; and by adopting the method of\r\nroot propagation, they were increased by August 1871, to 300. Three\r\nconsignments of plants, numbering in all 370, were received from\r\nScotland in 1871-72, besides a smaller number from the Royal Gardens,\r\nKew. From these various collections, the propagation has been so\r\nextensive, that on 31 March 1873, there were 6,719 young plants in\r\nSikkim, in addition to about 500 in Calcutta, and much more in 1874.\r\n\r\nThe ipecacuanha plant in India has been tried under a variety of\r\nconditions as regards sun and shade, but thus far with only a moderate\r\namount of success. The best results are those that have been obtained\r\nat Rungbi, 3000 feet above the sea, where the plants, placed in\r\nglazed frames, were reported in May 1873 as in the most healthy\r\ncondition.[1386]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The stem creeps a little below the surface of the soil,\r\nemitting a small number of slightly branching contorted roots, a few\r\ninches long. These roots when young are very slender and thread-like,\r\nbut grow gradually knotty and become by degrees invested with a very\r\nthick bark, transversely corrugated or ringed. Close examination of the\r\ndry root shows that the bark is raised in narrow warty ridges, which\r\nsometimes run entirely round the root, sometimes encircle only half\r\nits circumference. The whole surface is moreover minutely wrinkled\r\nlongitudinally. The rings or corrugations of a full sized root number\r\nabout 20 in an inch; not unfrequently they are deep enough to penetrate\r\nto the wood.\r\n\r\nThe root attains a maximum diameter of about ²/₁₀ of an inch; but as\r\nimported, a large proportion of it is much smaller. The woody central\r\npart is scarcely ¹/₂₀ of an inch in diameter, subcylindrical, sometimes\r\nstriated, and devoid of pith.\r\n\r\nIpecacuanha is of a dusky grey hue, occasionally of a dull ferruginous\r\nbrown. The root is hard, breaks short and granular (not fibrous),\r\nexhibiting a resinous, waxy, or farinaceous interior, white or greyish.\r\nThe bark, which constitutes 75 to 80 per cent. of the entire root, may\r\nbe easily separated from the less brittle wood. It has a bitterish\r\ntaste and faint, musty smell; when freshly dried it is probably much\r\nmore odorous. The wood is almost tasteless. In the drug of commerce\r\nthe roots are always much broken, and there is often a considerable\r\nseparation of bark from wood; portions of the non-annulated, woody,\r\nsubterraneous stem are always present.\r\n\r\n[1386] _Annual Report of the Royal Botanical Gardens_, Calcutta, 31 May\r\n1873—from which we have abstracted many of the foregoing particulars.\r\nThe report for 1876-1877 is by no means favourable to the prospects of\r\nCephaëlis in India.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years there has been imported into London a\r\nvariety of ipecacuanha, distinguished as _Carthagena_ or _New Granada\r\nIpecacuanha_, and differing from the Brazilian drug chiefly in being of\r\nlarger size. Thus, while the maximum diameter of the annulated roots of\r\nBrazilian ipecacuanha is about ²/₁₀ of an inch, corresponding roots of\r\nthe New Granada variety attain nearly ³/₁₀. The latter, moreover, has a\r\ndistinct radiate arrangement of the wood, due to a greater developement\r\nof the medullary rays, and is rather less conspicuously annulated.\r\nLefort (1869) has shown that the New Granada drug is a little less rich\r\nin emetine than the ipecacuanha of Brazil.\r\n\r\nMr. R. B. White, of Medellin in the valley of the Cauca, New Granada,\r\nnear which place the drug has been collected, has been good enough to\r\nsend us herbarium specimens of the plant with roots attached; they\r\nagree entirely with _Cephaëlis Ipecacuanha_.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The root is coated with a thin layer of brown\r\ncork-cells; the interior cortical tissue is made up of a uniform\r\nparenchyme, in which medullary rays cannot be distinguished. In the\r\nwoody column they are obvious; the prevailing tissue consists of short\r\npitted vessels. The cortical parenchyme and the medullary rays are\r\nloaded with small starch granules. Some cells of the interior part of\r\nthe bark contain however only bundles of acicular crystals of oxalate\r\nof calcium.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The peculiar principles of ipecacuanha are\r\n_Emetine_ and _Ipecacuanhic Acid_, together with a minute proportion of\r\na fœtid volatile oil. The activity of the drug appears to be due solely\r\nto the alkaloid, which taken internally is a potent emetic.\r\n\r\nEmetine, discovered in 1817 by Pelletier and Magendie, is a bitter\r\nsubstance with distinct alkaline reaction, amorphous in the free state\r\nas well as in most of its salts; we have succeeded in preparing a\r\ncrystallized hydrochlorate.\r\n\r\nThe root yields of the alkaloid less than 1 per cent.; the numerous\r\nhigher estimates that have been given relate to impure emetine, or have\r\nbeen arrived at by some defective methods of analysis.[1387]\r\n\r\n[1387] See the results obtained by Richard and Barruel, by Magendie and\r\nPelletier, and by Attfield, as recorded by the last named chemist in\r\n_Proceedings of the British Pharmaceutical Conference_ for 1869. 37-39.\r\n\r\nThe formula assigned to emetine by Reich (1863) was C₂₀H₃₀N₂O, that\r\ngiven by Glénard (1875) C₁₅H₂₂NO₂, and lastly that found in 1877 by\r\nLefort and F. Würtz, C₂₈H₄₀N₂O₅.\r\n\r\nThe alkaloid may be obtained by drying the powdered bark of the root\r\nwith a little milk of lime, and exhausting the mixture with boiling\r\nchloroform, petroleum-benzin or ether. It is a white powder turning\r\nbrown on exposure to light and softening at 70° C. Emetine assumes\r\nan intense and permanent yellow colour with solution of chlorinated\r\nlime and a little acetic acid, as shown by Power (1877). A solution\r\ncontaining but ¹/₆₀₀₀ of emetine still displays that reaction. We\r\nfound the alkaloid to be destitute of rotatory power, at least in the\r\nchloroform solution.\r\n\r\nThe above reactions may be easily shown thus:—Take 10 grains of\r\npowdered ipecacuanha, and mix them with 3 grains of quicklime and a few\r\ndrops of water. Dry the mixture in the water bath and transfer it to a\r\nvial containing 2 fluid drachms of chloroform: agitate frequently, then\r\nfilter into a capsule containing a minute quantity of acetic acid,\r\nand allow the chloroform to evaporate. Two drops of water now added\r\nwill afford a nearly colourless solution of emetine, which, placed in\r\na watch-glass, will readily give amorphous precipitates upon addition\r\nof a saturated solution of nitrate of potassium, or of tannic acid, or\r\nof a solution of mercuric iodide in iodide of potassium. To the nitrate\r\nPower’s test may be further applied.\r\n\r\nIf the _wood_ separated as exactly as possible from the bark is used,\r\nand the experiment performed in the same way, the solution will reveal\r\nonly traces of emetine. By addition of nitrate of potassium, no\r\nprecipitate is then produced, but tannic acid or the potassico-mercuric\r\niodate afford a slight turbidity. This experiment confirms the\r\nobservation that the bark is the seat of the alkaloid, as might indeed\r\nbe inferred from the fact that the wood is nearly tasteless.\r\n\r\n_Ipecacuanhic Acid_, regarded by Pelletier as gallic acid, but\r\nrecognised in 1850 as a peculiar substance by Willigk,[1388] is\r\nreddish-brown, amorphous, bitter, and very hygroscopic. It is related\r\nto caffetannic and kinic acids; Reich has shown it to be a glucoside.\r\n\r\nIpecacuanha contains also, according to Reich, small proportions of\r\nresin, fat, albumin, and fermentable and crystallizable sugar; also gum\r\nand a large quantity of pectin. The bark yielded about 30 per cent.,\r\nand the wood more than 7 per cent. of starch.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The imports of ipecacuanha into the United Kingdom in 1870\r\namounted to 62,952 lb., valued at £16,639.[1389]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Ipecacuanha is given as an emetic, but much more often in small\r\ndoses as an expectorant and diaphoretic. In India it has proved of\r\nlate a most important remedy for dysentery. Since the year 1858 when\r\nthe administration of ipecacuanha in large (30 grains) doses began to\r\nbe adopted, the mortality in the cases treated for this complaint has\r\ngreatly diminished.[1390]\r\n\r\n=Adulteration and Substitutes=—It can hardly be said that ipecacuanha\r\nas at present imported is ever adulterated. Although it may contain\r\nan undue proportion of the woody stems of the plant, it is not\r\nfraudulently admixed with other roots. But it very often arrives much\r\ndeteriorated by damp: we have the authority of an experienced druggist\r\nfor saying that at least three packages out of every four offered in\r\nthe London drug sales, have either been damaged by sea-water or by damp\r\nduring their transit to the coast.\r\n\r\nSeveral roots have been described as _False Ipecacuanha_, but we know\r\nnot one that would not be readily distinguished at first sight by any\r\ndruggist of average knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil the word _Poaya_ is applied to emetic roots of plants of at\r\nleast six genera, belonging to the orders _Rubiaceæ_, _Violarieæ_, and\r\n_Polygaleæ_; while in the same country, the name _Ipecacuanha_ is used\r\nfor various species of _Ionidium_[1391] as well as for _Cephaëlis_.\r\n\r\n[1388] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, xv. (1862) 523.\r\n\r\n[1389] _Annual Statement of the Trade and Navigation of the U.K. for\r\n1870._—The more recent issues of this return have been simplified to\r\nsuch an extent that drugs are for the greater part included under one\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n[1390] In the Madras Presidency, the death-rate from dysentery was\r\n71 per 1000 cases treated: under the new method of treatment, it has\r\nbeen reduced to 13·5. In Bengal it has fallen from 88·2 to 28·8 per\r\n1000.—_Supplement to the Gazette of India_, January 23, 1869.\r\n\r\n[1391] As _Ionidium Ipecacuanha_ Vent., _I. Poaya_ St. Hil., _I.\r\nparviflorum_ Vent., the first of which affords the _Poaya branca_\r\nor _White Ipecacuanha_ of the Brazilians.—See C.F.P. von Martius,\r\n_Specimen Mat. Med. Bras._ 1824; A. de St. Hilaire, _Plantes usuelles\r\ndes Brésiliens_, 1827-28.\r\n\r\nSome of these roots, which are occasionally brought to Europe under the\r\nnotion that they may find a market, have been described and figured by\r\npharmacologists. We shall notice only the following:—\r\n\r\n1. _Large Striated Ipecacuanha_—This is the root of _Psychotria\r\nemetica_ Mutis (_Rubiaceæ_), a native of New Granada. It is\r\nconsiderably stouter than true ipecacuanha, but consists like the\r\nlatter of a woody column covered with a thick brownish bark. The\r\nlatter, though marked here and there with constrictions and fissures,\r\nis not annulated like ipecacuanha, but has very evident longitudinal\r\nfurrows. But its most remarkable character is that it remains _soft and\r\nmoist, tough to the knife_, even after many years; and the cut surface\r\nhas a dull violet hue. The root has a sweetish taste and abounds in\r\nsugar;[1392] its decoction is not rendered blue by iodine, nor is any\r\nstarch to be detected by means of the microscope. The drug occasionally\r\nappears in the London market.\r\n\r\n2. _Small Striated Ipecacuanha_—This drug in outward appearance closely\r\nresembles the preceding, but is usually of smaller size, sometimes\r\nmuch smaller and in short pieces tapering towards either end. It also\r\ndiffers in being brittle, abounding in starch, and having its woody\r\ncolumn provided with numerous pores, easily visible under a lens. Prof.\r\nPlanchon[1393] of Paris, who has particularly examined both varieties\r\nof Striated Ipecacuanha, is of opinion that the drug under notice may\r\nbe derived from some species of _Richardsonia_.\r\n\r\n3. _Undulated Ipecacuanha_—The root thus called is that of _Richardia\r\nscabra_ L. (_Richardsonia scabra_ St. Hilaire), a plant of the same\r\norder as _Cephaëlis_, very common in Brazil, where it grows in\r\ncultivated ground and sandy places, or by roadsides, and even in\r\nthe less frequented streets of Rio de Janeiro. Authentic specimens\r\nhave been forwarded to us by Mr. Glaziou of Rio de Janeiro, and Mr.\r\nJ. Correa de Méllo of Campinas; and we have also had ample supplies\r\nof the plant cultivated by us near London and at Strassburg, where\r\nRichardsonia succeeds in the open air.\r\n\r\nThe root in the fresh state is pure white, but by drying becomes of\r\na deep iron-grey. In the Brazilian specimens, there is a short crown\r\nemitting as many as a dozen prostrate stems; below this there is\r\ngenerally, as in true ipecacuanha, a naked woody portion, which extends\r\ndownwards into a thicker root, ²/₁₀ of an inch in diameter, and six\r\nor more inches long. This part of the root is marked by deep fissures\r\non alternate sides, which give it a knotty, sinuous, or undulating\r\noutline. It has a brittle, very thick bark, white and farinaceous\r\nwithin, surrounding a strong flexible slender woody column. The root\r\nhas an earthy odour not altogether unlike that of ipecacuanha, and a\r\nslightly sweet taste. It affords no evidence of emetine when tested\r\nin the manners described at p. 374, and can therefore easily be\r\ndistinguished from the true drug.\r\n\r\n[1392] Attfield in _Pharm. Journ._ xi.

The plant is found in plains and uplands, ascending even in\r\nSweden to 1200 feet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\nIn England, valerian is cultivated in many villages[1394] near\r\nChesterfield in Derbyshire, the wild plant which occurs in the\r\nneighbourhood not being sufficiently plentiful to supply the demand.\r\n\r\nIn Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, as well as in Holland, the\r\nplant is grown to some extent, but by far the largest supply would\r\nappear to be grown in the environs of the German town Cölleda, not far\r\nfrom Leipzig.\r\n\r\nValerian is propagated by separating the young plants which are\r\ndeveloped at the end of runners emitted from the rootstock.\r\n\r\nThe wild plant, according to the situation it inhabits, exhibits\r\nseveral divergent forms. Among eight or more varieties noticed by\r\nbotanists,[1395] we may especially distinguish α. _major_ with a\r\ncomparatively tall stem and all the leaves toothed, β. _minor_ (_V.\r\nangustifolia_ Tausch) with entire or slightly dentate leaves, and also\r\n_V. sambucifolia_ Mikan, having only 4 or 5 pairs of leaflets.\r\n\r\n=History=—The plant which the Greeks and Romans called Φοῦ or _Phu_,\r\nand which Dioscorides and Pliny describe as a sort of wild nard, is\r\nusually held to be some species of valerian.[1396]\r\n\r\nThe word _Valeriana_ is not found in the classical authors. We first\r\nmeet with it in the 9th or 10th century, at which period and for long\r\nafterwards, it was used as synonymous with _Phu_ or _Fu_.\r\n\r\nThus in the writings of Isaac Judæus[1397] occurs the following:—“_Fu\r\nid est valeriana, melior rubea et tenuis et quæ venit de Armenia et est\r\ndiversa in sua complexione_....”\r\n\r\nConstantinus Africanus[1398]—“_Fu, id est valeriana. Naturam habet\r\nsicut spica nardi_....”\r\n\r\nThe word _Valeriane_ occurs in the recipes of the Anglo-Saxon leeches\r\nwritten as early as the 11th century.[1399] _Valeriana_, _Amantilla_\r\nand _Fu_ are used as synonymous in the _Alphita_, a mediæval vocabulary\r\nof the school of Salernum.[1400]\r\n\r\nSaladinus[1401] of Ascoli directs (_circa_ A.D. 1450) the collection in\r\nthe month of August of “_radices fu id est valerianæ_.”\r\n\r\n[1394] Namely Ashover, Woolley Moor, Morton, Stretton, Higham,\r\nShirland, Pilsley, North and South Wingfield, and Brackenfield. From\r\nthe produce of these villages, one wholesale dealer in Chesterfield\r\nobtained in 1872 about 6 tons (13,440 lb.) of root.\r\n\r\n[1395] Regel, _Tentamen Floræ Ussuriensis_, 1862 (_Mém. de l’Académie\r\nde St. Pétersbourg_).\r\n\r\n[1396] _V. officinalis_ L. and nine other species occur in Asia Minor\r\n(Tehihatcheff).\r\n\r\n[1397] _Opera Omnia_, Lugd. 1515, cap. 45.—It must be remembered that\r\nthis is a translation from the Arabic. How the word in question stands\r\nin the original we have no means of knowing.\r\n\r\n[1398] _De omnibus medico cognitu necessariis_, Basil. 1539. 348.\r\n\r\n[1399] _Leechdoms, Wortcunning and Starcraft of early England_, iii.\r\n(1866) 6. 136.\r\n\r\n[1400] S. de Renzi, _Collectio Salernitana_, iii. (1854) 271-322.\r\n\r\n[1401] _Compendium Aromatariorum_, Bonon. 1488.\r\n\r\nValerian was anciently called in English _Setwall_, a name properly\r\napplied to _Zedoary_; and the root was so much valued for its medicinal\r\nvirtues, that as Gerarde[1402] (1567) remarks, the poorer classes\r\nin the north of England esteemed “_no broths, pottage, or physicall\r\nmeats_” to be worth anything without it. Its odour, now considered\r\nintolerable, was not so regarded in the 16th century, when it was\r\nabsolutely the custom to lay the root among clothes as a perfume[1403]\r\nin the same way as those of _Valeriana celtica_ L. and the Himalayan\r\nvalerians are still used in the East.\r\n\r\nSome of the names applied to valerian in Northern and Central Europe\r\nare remarkable. Thus in Scandinavia we find _Velandsrot_, _Velamsrot_,\r\n_Vandelrot_ (Swedish); _Vendelród_, _Venderód_, _Vendingsród_\r\n(Norwegian); and _Velandsurt_ (Danish)—names all signifying _Vandels’\r\nroot_.[1404] Valerian is also called in Danish _Danmarks græs_. Among\r\nthe German-speaking population of Switzerland, a similar word to the\r\nlast, namely _Tannmark_, is applied to valerian. The _Denemarcha_\r\nmentioned by St. Hildegard,[1405] about A.D. 1160, is the same. These\r\nnames seem to point to some connexion with Northern Europe which we are\r\nwholly unable to explain.\r\n\r\nPentz, a pharmaceutical assistant at Pyrmont, was the first, in 1829,\r\nto draw attention to the acid reaction of the distilled water of\r\nvalerian. Another German assistant, Grote, at Verden, showed in 1831\r\nthat the acidity was by no means due to acetic acid, but to a peculiar\r\nkind of acid. The latter was identified in 1843 by Dumas with the acid\r\nartificially obtained from amylic alcohol and that extracted in 1817 by\r\nChevreul from the fat of dolphins.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The valerian root of the shops consists of an upright\r\nrhizome of the thickness of the little finger, emitting a few short\r\nhorizontal branches, besides numerous slender rootlets.[1406] The\r\nrhizome is naturally very short, and is rendered still more so by the\r\npractice of cutting it in order to facilitate drying. The rootlets,\r\nwhich are generally 3 to 4 inches long, attain ⅒ of an inch in\r\ndiameter, tapering and dividing into slender fibres towards their\r\nextremities. They are shrivelled, very brittle, and, as well as the\r\nrhizome, of a dull, earthy brown. When broken transversely, they\r\ndisplay a dark epidermis, forming part of a thick white bark which\r\nsurrounds a slender woody column. The interior of the rhizome is\r\ncompact, firm and horny, but when old becomes hollow, a portion of the\r\ntissue remaining however in the form of transverse septa.\r\n\r\nThe drug has a peculiar, somewhat terebinthinous and camphor-like\r\nodour, and a bitterish, aromatic taste. The root when just taken from\r\nthe ground has no distinctive smell, but acquires its characteristic\r\nodour as it dries.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=[1407]—In the rhizome as well as in the\r\nrootlets, the cortical part is separated from the central column by a\r\ndark cambial zone; the medullary rays are not distinctly obvious. In\r\nold rootstocks, sclerenchymatous cells are met with in the cortical\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\n[1402] _Herball_, 1636. 1078.\r\n\r\n[1403] Turner’s _Herball_, part 3 (1568) 76; Langham, _Garden of\r\nHealth_, 1633. 598.\r\n\r\n[1404] H. Jenssen-Tusch, _Nordiske Plantenavne_, Kjöbenhavn, 1867. 258.\r\n\r\n[1405] _Physica_, Argent. 1533. 62.\r\n\r\n[1406] The morphological peculiarities of valerian root are well\r\nexplained in Irmisch, _Beitrag zur Naturgeschichte der einheimischen\r\nValeriana-Arten_, Halle, 1854, 44 pages, 4°, 4 plates.\r\n\r\n[1407] The structure of the rhizomes and root of the different species\r\nof valerian has been discussed by Joannes Chatin in his _Etudes sur les\r\nValérianées_, Paris, 1872, illustrated by 14 beautiful plates.\r\n\r\nThe parenchyme of the drug is loaded with small starch granules,\r\nbrownish grains of tannic matter and drops of essential oil. Numerous\r\noil ducts are met with in the outer layer of the tissue.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Volatile oil is contained in the dry root to\r\nthe extent of ½ to 2 per cent., yet on an average appears scarcely to\r\nexceed ⁴/₅ per cent. This variation in quantity is partly explained by\r\nthe influence of locality, a dry, stony soil yielding a root richer in\r\noil than one that is moist and fertile. In the latter the plant may be\r\ndistinguished as the variety _sambucifolia_, which has a less vigorous\r\nroot, devoid of runners.\r\n\r\nSchoonbroodt[1408] has shown that the most important influence is the\r\nrecent condition of the root. He states that if the root is submitted\r\nto distillation when perfectly fresh, it yields a neutral water and\r\na large quantity of essential oil. The latter has but a very faint\r\nodour, but by exposure to the air it slowly acidifies, especially if a\r\nlittle alkali is added, and acquires a strong smell. _Valerianic Acid_\r\nwhich is thus formed amounts to 6 per mille of the fresh root. The\r\ndried root yields a distillate of decided valerian odour, containing\r\nvalerianic acid, but in proportion not exceeding 4 per mille of the\r\nroot calculated as fresh.\r\n\r\nThe oil of valerian is of a very peculiar yellowish or brownish,\r\nsometimes even almost a little greenish hue, and possessing the\r\ncharacteristic odour of the drug. We found it to deviate the plane\r\nof polarization from 11° to 13° to the left when examined by Wild’s\r\nPolaristrobometer in a column of 50 millimetres. By submitting it to\r\nfractional distillation we noticed[1409] that it affords a magnificent\r\nblue fraction. A superb violet or blue colour is produced if one drop\r\nof the _crude oil_ dissolved in about 20 drops of bisulphide of carbon\r\nis mixed with 1 drop of nitric acid 1·20 sp. gr. Other colorations are\r\nproduced if bromine or concentrated sulphuric acid are used;[1410] even\r\nthe tincture of valerian displays similar reactions.\r\n\r\nBruylants (1878) has isolated from oil of valerian—1st. A hydrocarbon,\r\nC₁₀H₁₆, boiling at 157° C., yielding a crystallized compound with\r\nHCl. 2nd. The liquid compound C₁₀H₁₈O, which by means of chromic acid\r\naffords common camphor and formic, acetic and valerianic acids, which\r\nare met with in old valerian root, owing no doubt to the slow oxidation\r\nof the compound C₁₀H₁₈O. 3rd. There is also present a crystallizable\r\ncompound of the same composition, which is probably identical with\r\nthe camphor of Dryobalanops aromatica (see our article on Camphora).\r\nIt would appear that this substance is of alcoholic nature, being\r\ncombined in the root with the 3 organic acids mentioned under 2nd. On\r\ndistilling, these compound ethers are resolved partly into the alcohol\r\nC₁₀H₁₈O (borneol) and the acids. This decomposition is fully performed,\r\nif the root is macerated with alkaline water, and then, on distilling,\r\na slight excess of sulphuric acid is added. 4th. At about 300° a\r\ngreenish portion is coming over, which can be obtained colourless by\r\nagain rectifying it. This oil assumes intense colorations if it is\r\nshaken with concentrated mineral acids; it becomes blue by distilling\r\nit over potash.\r\n\r\n[1408] _Journ. de Médecine de Bruxelles_, 1867 and 1868;\r\n_Jahresbericht_ of Wiggers and Husemann, 1869. 17.\r\n\r\n[1409] _Archiv der Pharmacie_, 209 (1876).\r\n\r\n[1410] _Jahresbericht_ of Wiggers and Husemann, 1871. 462.\r\n\r\nValerianic acid as afforded by the root is not agreeing with normal\r\nvalerianic acid. It is, more exactly, _isovalerianic acid_, or\r\nisopropyl-acetic acid: (CH₃)₂CH·CH₂COOH, which is produced by Valeriana\r\nas well as by Archangelica officinalis and Viburnum Opulus. The same\r\nacid also may be obtained from the fat of Dolphinus globiceps.\r\n\r\nAfter the root has been submitted to the distillation of the oil, there\r\nis found a strongly acid residue containing malic acid, resin, and\r\nsugar,—the last capable, according to Schoonbroodt, of reducing cupric\r\noxide.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Valerian is employed as a stimulant and antispasmodic.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—In the London market there has been offered “_Kesso_” the\r\nroot of _Patrinia scabiosaefolia_ Link,[1411] a Japanese herb of the\r\norder Valerianaceæ. This drug consists of a very short rootstock giving\r\noff a large number of rootlets about 5 inches long and ⅒ of an inch\r\nin diameter. By the absence of a well-marked upright rhizome in this\r\n_Japanese Valerian_ it is widely differing from our Valerian, although\r\nat first sight it agrees to some extent with it. As to the odour and\r\ntaste we find Kesso almost identical with true Valerian.\r\n\r\nThe less aromatic and now disused root of _Valeriana Phu_ L. consists\r\nof a thicker rhizome which lies in the earth obliquely; it is less\r\nclosely annulated and rooted at the bottom only. It resembles by no\r\nmeans true Valerian.\r\n\r\n[1411] According to Holmes, _Ph. J._ x. (1879) 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX INULÆ.\r\n\r\n_Radix Enulæ_, _Radix Helenii_; _Elecampane_;[1412] F. _Racine\r\nd’Aunée_; G. _Alantwurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Inula Helenium_ L.—This stately perennial plant\r\nis very widely distributed, occurring scattered throughout the\r\nwhole of central and southern Europe, and extending eastward to the\r\nCaucasus, Southern Siberia and the Himalaya. It is found here and there\r\napparently wild in the south of England and Ireland, as well as in\r\nSouthern Norway and in Finland (Schübeler).\r\n\r\nElecampane was formerly cultivated in gardens as a medicinal and\r\nculinary plant, and in this manner has wandered to North America. In\r\nHolland and some parts of England and Switzerland, it is cultivated on\r\na somewhat larger scale, most largely probably near Cölleda (see p.\r\n377).\r\n\r\n[1412] A corruption of _Enula Campana_, the latter word referring to\r\nthe growth of the plant in Campania (Italy).\r\n\r\n=History=—The plant was known to the ancient writers on agriculture\r\nand natural history, and even the Roman poets were acquainted with it,\r\nand mention Inula as affording a root used both as a medicine and a\r\ncondiment. Vegetius Renatus, about the beginning of the 5th century,\r\ncalls it Inula Campana, and St. Isidore in the beginning of the 7th\r\nnames it as _Inula_, adding—“quam _Alam_ rustici vocant.” It is\r\nfrequently mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon writings on medicine current\r\nin England prior to the Norman Conquest; it is also the “marchalan” of\r\nthe Welsh Physicians[1413] of the 13th century and was generally well\r\nknown during the middle ages. Not only was its root much employed as a\r\nmedicine, but it was also candied and eaten as a sweetmeat.\r\n\r\n=Description=—For pharmaceutical use, the root is taken from plants\r\ntwo or three years old; when more advanced, it becomes too woody. The\r\nprinciple mass of the root is a very thick short crown, dividing below\r\ninto several fleshy branches of which the larger are an inch or two\r\nin diameter, covered with a pale yellow bark, internally whitish, and\r\njuicy. The smaller roots are dried entire; the larger are variously\r\nsliced, which occasions them to curl up irregularly. When dried, they\r\nare of a light grey, brittle, horny, smooth-fractured. Cut transversely\r\nthe young root exhibits an indistinct radiate structure, with a\r\nsomewhat darker cambial zone separating the thick bark from the woody\r\nnucleus. The pith is not sharply defined, and is often porous and\r\nhollow. In the older roots the bark is relatively much thinner, and\r\nthe internal substance is nearly uniform. Elecampane root has a weak\r\naromatic odour suggestive of orris and camphor, and a slightly bitter,\r\nnot unpleasant, aromatic taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The medullary rays, both of the woody\r\ncolumn and the inner part of the bark (_endophlœum_), exhibit large\r\nbalsam-ducts. In the fresh root they contain an aromatic liquid, which\r\nas it dries deposits crystals of helenin, probably derived from the\r\nessential oil. The parenchymatous cells of the drug are loaded with\r\ninulin in the form of splinter-like fragments, devoid of any peculiar\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—It was observed by Le Febvre, as early as 1660,\r\nthat when the root of elecampane is subjected to distillation with\r\nwater a crystallizable substance collects in the head of the receiver\r\nfrom which it speedily passes on as the operation proceeds. Similar\r\ncrystals may also be observed after carefully heating a thin slice\r\nof the root, and are even found as a natural efflorescence on the\r\nsurface of root that has been long kept. They can be extracted from the\r\nroot by means of alcohol and precipitated with water. Kallen (1874,\r\n1876) showed that the crystals chiefly consist of the _anhydride_,\r\nC₁₅H₂₀O₂, of _alantic acid_, melting at 66° C. The anhydride, which is\r\nvery little aromatic, can easily be sublimed, although it begins to\r\nboil only at 275°, yet not without decomposition. Alantic anhydride\r\ndissolves in caustic lye, but on saturating the solution with an acid,\r\nalantic acid, C₁₅H₂₂O₃, separates. It is not present in the root.\r\n\r\nThe anhydride is accompanied by a small quantity of _Helenin_, C₆H₈O,\r\nand _Alantcamphor_ (i.e. Elecampane-camphor). The crystals of helenin\r\nhave a slightly (?) bitterish taste, but no odour, and melt at 110°.\r\nThe camphor, occurring in but very small amount, has not yet been\r\nanalyzed; it agrees probably with the formula C₁₀H₁₆O; it melts at\r\n64° C., and in taste and smell is suggestive of peppermint. It is\r\nvery difficult entirely to remove helenin from alantcamphor, these\r\nsubstances being soluble to nearly the same extent in alcohol or ether.\r\nBy distilling the second of them with pentasulphide of phosphorus,\r\n_Cymene_, C₁₀H₁₄, was obtained.\r\n\r\n[1413] _Meddygon Myddfai_, p. 61. 284. 311 (see Appendix).\r\n\r\nBy distilling the root under notice with water, the alantic anhydride\r\nis chiefly obtained, but impregnated with _Alantol_, C₁₀H₁₆O\r\n(probably). The latter can be removed from the crystals by pressing\r\nthem between folds of bibulous paper. On submitting this again to\r\ndistillation, alantol is obtained as an aromatic liquid, boiling at\r\n200°.\r\n\r\nThe substance most abundantly contained in elecampane root is _Inulin_,\r\ndiscovered in it by Valentine Rose at Berlin in 1804. It has the same\r\ncomposition as starch, C₆H₁₀O₅, but stands to a certain extent in\r\nopposition to that substance, which it replaces in the root-system of\r\n_Compositæ_. In living plants, inulin is dissolved in the watery juice,\r\nand on drying is deposited within the cells in amorphous masses, which\r\nin polarized light are inactive, and are not coloured by iodine. There\r\nare various other characters, by which inulin differs from starch. Thus\r\nfor instance, inulin readily dissolves in about 3 parts of boiling\r\nwater; the solution is perfectly clear and fluid, not paste-like; but\r\non cooling deposits nearly all the inulin. The solution is levogyre and\r\nis easily transformed into uncrystallizable sugar. With nitric acid,\r\ninulin affords no explosive compound as starch does.\r\n\r\nSachs showed in 1864 that by immersing the roots of elecampane, or\r\n_Dahlia variabilis_ or of many other perennial _Compositæ_, in alcohol\r\nor glycerin, inulin may be precipitated in a crystalline form. Its\r\nglobular aggregates of needle-shaped crystals (“sphæro-crystals”)\r\nthen exhibit under the polarizing microscope a cross similar to that\r\ndisplayed by starch grains.\r\n\r\nThe amount of inulin varies according to the season, but is most\r\nabundant in the autumn. Of the various sources for it, the richest\r\nappears to be elecampane. Dragendorff, who has made it the subject of a\r\nvery exhaustive treatise,[1414] obtained from the root in October not\r\nless than 44 per cent., but in spring only 19 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn the roots of the _Compositæ_ inulin is accompanied, according to\r\nPopp,[1415] by two closely allied substances, _Synanthrose_, C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁\r\n+ H₂O, and _Inuloïd_, C₆H₁₀O₅ + H₂O. Synanthrose is soluble in dilute\r\nalcohol, devoid of any rotatory power, and deliquescent. Inuloïd is\r\nmuch more readily soluble in water than inulin. Both these substances\r\nare probably present in elecampane.\r\n\r\nInulin is widely distributed in the perennial roots of compositæ, and\r\nhas also been met with in the natural orders Campanulaceæ, Goodenovieæ\r\n(or Goodeniaceæ), Lobeliaceæ, Stylidieæ, and lastly by Kraus (1879) in\r\nthe root of _Ionidium Ipecacuanha_ St. Hilaire, Violaceæ; the formerly\r\nso-called _Ipecacuanha alba lignosa_ (see p. 375, note 4).\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Elecampane is an aromatic tonic, but as a medicine is now\r\nobsolete. It is chiefly sold for veterinary practice. In France\r\nand Switzerland (Neuchâtel), it is employed in the distillation of\r\n_Absinthe_.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—Dioscorides in speaking of _Costus_ root states that it\r\nis often mixed with that of elecampane of Kommagene (north-western\r\nSyria). The former, derived from _Aplotaxis[1416] auriculata_ DC. (_A.\r\nLappa_ Decaisne, _Aucklandia Costus_ Falconer), is remarkably similar\r\nto elecampane both in external appearance and structure. Costus is an\r\nimportant spice, incense and medicine in the east from the antiquity\r\ndown to the present day;[1417] it would be of great interest to examine\r\nit chemically with regard to elecampane.\r\n\r\n[1414] _Materialien zu einer Monographie des Inulins_, St. Petersburg,\r\n1870. 141 pages—See also _Prantl’s_ paper on Inulin, as abstracted in\r\n_Pharm.

(_Anthemis Pyrethrum_ L.),\r\na low perennial plant with small, much divided leaves, and a radiate\r\nflower resembling a large daisy. It is a native of northern Africa,\r\nespecially Algeria, growing on the high plateaux that intervene between\r\nthe fertile coast regions and the desert.\r\n\r\n=History=—The πύρεθρον of Dioscorides was an umbelliferous plant, the\r\ndetermination of which must be left to conjecture. The pellitory of\r\nmodern times was familiar to the Arabian writers on medicine, one of\r\nwhom, Ibn Baytar, describes it very correctly from specimens gathered\r\nby himself near the city of Constantine in Algeria. The plant, says\r\nhe, called by the Berbers _sandasab_, is found nowhere but in Western\r\nAfrica, from which region it is carried to other countries.[1418]\r\n\r\nPellitory root is a favourite remedy in the East, and has long been\r\nan article of export by way of Egypt to India. An Arabic name for\r\nit is _Aāqarqarhā_ or _Akulkara_[1419], a word which, under slight\r\nvariations, is found in the principal languages of India. In Germany,\r\npellitory was known as early as the 12th century; it is named in the\r\noldest printed works on materia medica. In the 13th century “pellitory\r\nof _Spain_” (Pelydr ysbain) was a proved “remedy for the toothache”\r\nwith the Welsh physicians.[1420]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The root as found in the shops is simple, 3 to 4 inches\r\nlong by ⅜ to ⁴/₈ of an inch thick, cylindrical, or tapering, sometimes\r\nterminated at top by the bristly remains of leaves, and having only\r\na few hair-like rootlets. It has a brown, rough, shrivelled surface,\r\nis compact and brittle, the fractured surface being radiate and\r\ndestitute of pith. The bark, at most ¹/₂₅ of an inch thick, adheres\r\nclosely to the wood, a narrow zone of cambium intervening. The woody\r\ncolumn is traversed by large medullary rays in which, as in the bark,\r\nnumerous dark resin-ducts are scattered. The root has a slight aromatic\r\nsmell, and a persistent, pungent taste, exciting a singular tingling\r\nsensation, and a remarkable flow of saliva. The drug is very liable to\r\nthe attacks of insects.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The cortical part of this root is remarkable on\r\naccount of its suberous layer, which is partly made up of sclerenchyme\r\n(thick-walled cells). Balsam-ducts (oil-cells) occur as well in\r\nthe middle cortical layer as in the medullary rays. Most of the\r\nparenchymatous cells are loaded with lumps of inulin; pellitory in fact\r\nis one of those roots most abounding in that substance.\r\n\r\n[1418] Sontheimer’s translation, ii. (1842) 179.\r\n\r\n[1419] _Haq’recarcha_; see Steinschneider, in Rohlfs’ Archiv für\r\nGeschichte der Medicin (1879) 342.\r\n\r\n[1420] _Meddygon Myddfai_ (see Appendix) 184. 292. 374.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Pellitory has been analysed by several chemists,\r\nwhose labours have shown that its pungent taste is due in great part\r\nto a resin, not yet fully examined. The root also contains a little\r\nvolatile oil besides, sugar, gum, and a trace of tannic acid. The\r\nso-called _Pyrethrin_ is a mixed substance.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The root is collected chiefly in Algeria and is\r\nexported from Oran and to a smaller extent from Algiers. But from\r\nthe information we have received from Colonel Playfair, British\r\nConsul-General for Algeria, and from Mr. Wood, British Consul at Tunis,\r\nit appears that the greater part is shipped from Tunis to Leghorn\r\nand Egypt. Mr. Wood was informed that the drug is imported from the\r\nfrontier town of Tebessa in Algeria into the regency of Tunis, to the\r\nextent of 500 _cantars_ (50,000 lb.) per annum.\r\n\r\nBombay imported in the year 1871-72, 740 cwt. of this drug, of which\r\nmore than half was shipped to other ports of India.[1421]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Chiefly employed as a sialogogue for the relief of toothache,\r\noccasionally in the form of tincture as a stimulant and rubefacient.\r\n\r\n=Substitute=—In Germany, Russia and Scandinavia, African pellitory\r\nis replaced by the root of _Anacyclus officinarum_ Hayne, an annual\r\nherb long cultivated in Prussia and Saxony.[1422] Its root of a light\r\ngrey is only half as thick as that of _A. Pyrethrum_, and is always\r\nabundantly provided with adherent remains of stalks and leaves. It is\r\nquite as pungent as that of the perennial species.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORES ANTHEMIDIS.\r\n\r\n_Chamomile Flowers_; F. _Fleurs de Camomille Romaine_; G. _Römische\r\nKamillen_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Anthemis nobilis_ L., the Common or Roman\r\nChamomile, a small creeping perennial plant, throwing up in the latter\r\npart of the summer solitary flowerheads.\r\n\r\nIt is abundant on the commons in the neighbourhood of London, and\r\ngenerally throughout the south of England; and extends to Ireland, but\r\nis not a native of Scotland, except the islands of Bute and Cumbrae,\r\nwhere Anthemis is stated to grow wild. It is plentiful in the west and\r\ncentre of France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Dalmatia; and occurs as a\r\ndoubtful native in Southern and Central Russia.\r\n\r\n=History=—The identification of the chamomile in the classical and\r\nother ancient authors seems to be impossible, on account of the large\r\nnumber of allied plants having similar inflorescence.\r\n\r\nThe chamomile has been cultivated for centuries in English gardens, the\r\nflowers being a common domestic medicine. The double variety was well\r\nknown in the 16th century.\r\n\r\nThe plant was introduced, according to Gesner, into Germany from\r\nSpain about the close of the middle ages. Tragus first designated it\r\n_Chamomilla nobilis_,[1423] and Joachim Camerarius (1598), who had\r\nobserved its abundance near Rome, gave it the name of _Roman Chamomile_.\r\n\r\n[1421] _Statement of the Trade and Navigation of the Presidency of\r\nBombay_ in 1871-72, pt. ii. 19. 98.\r\n\r\n[1422] For further information on the medicinal species of _Anacyclus_,\r\nsee a paper by Dr. P. Ascherson in _Bonplandia_, 15 April 1858.\r\n\r\n[1423] _De Stirpium_ ..., 1552. 149.—In Germany the epithet _edel_ (=\r\n_nobilis_) is frequently used in popular botany to designate useful or\r\nremarkable plants. Tragus may have been induced to bestow it on the\r\nspecies under notice, on account of its superiority to _Matricaria\r\nCamomilla_, the so-called _Common Chamomile_ of the Germans.\r\n\r\nPorta, about the year 1604,[1424] states that 100 pounds of _Flores\r\nChamœmeli_ yielded 2 drachmæ of a green volatile oil; we suppose he\r\ndistilled the flowers under notice.\r\n\r\n=Production=—The camomile is cultivated at Mitcham, near London, the\r\nland applied to this purpose being in 1864 about 55 acres, and the\r\nyield reckoned at about 4 cwt. per acre. The flowers are carefully\r\ngathered, and dried by artificial heat; and fetch a high price in the\r\nmarket.[1425]\r\n\r\nThe plant is grown on a large scale at Kieritzsch, between Leipzig and\r\nAltenburg, and near Zeiz and Borna, all in Saxony; and likewise to some\r\nextent in Belgium and France.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The chamomile flowers found in commerce are never those\r\nof the wild plant, but are produced by a variety in which the tubular\r\nflorets have all, or for the greater part been converted into ligulate\r\nflorets. In the flowers of some localities this conversion has been\r\nless complete, and such flowers having a somewhat yellow centre, are\r\ncalled by druggists _Single Chamomiles_; while those in which all the\r\nflorets are ligulate and white, are known as _Double Chamomiles_.\r\n\r\nChamomile flowers have the general structure found in the order\r\n_Compositæ_. They are ½ to ¾ of an inch across, and consist of a\r\nhemispherical involucre about ⅜ of an inch in diameter, composed of a\r\nnumber of nearly equal bracts, scarious at the margin. The receptacle\r\nis solid, conical, about ¼ of an inch in height, beset with thin,\r\nconcave, blunt, narrow, chaffy scales, from the bases of which grow the\r\nnumerous florets. In the wild plant, the outer of these, to the number\r\nof 12 or more, are white, narrow, strap-shaped, and slightly toothed\r\nat the apex. The central or disc florets are yellow and tubular, with\r\na somewhat bell-shaped summit from which project the two reflexed\r\nstigmas. In the cultivated plant, the ligulate florets predominate, or\r\nreplace entirely the tubular. The florets which are wholly destitute of\r\npappus are reflexed, so that the capitulum when dried has the aspect\r\nof a little white ball. Minute oil-glands are sparingly scattered\r\nover the tubular portion of the florets of either kind. The flowers\r\nof chamomile, as well as the green parts of the plant, have a strong\r\naroma, and a very bitter taste.\r\n\r\nIn trade, dried chamomile flowers are esteemed in proportion as they\r\nare of large size, very double, and of a good white—the last named\r\nquality being due in great measure to fine dry weather during the\r\nflowering period. Flowers that are buff or brownish, or only partially\r\ndouble, command a lower price.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Chamomile flowers yield from 0·6 to 0·8 per\r\ncent. of essential oil,[1426] which is at first of a pale blue, but\r\nbecomes yellowish-brown in the course of a few months.\r\n\r\nAt Mitcham, oil of chamomile is usually distilled from the _entire\r\nplant_, after the best flowers have been gathered. The oil has a shade\r\nof green, to remove which it is exposed to sunlight; it thus acquires a\r\nbrownish-yellow colour, at the same time throwing down a considerable\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\n[1424] _De distillatione_, Romæ, 1608. 83.\r\n\r\n[1425] About £9 per cwt., Foreign Chamomiles being worth from £3 to £4.\r\n\r\n[1426] Information obligingly given by Messrs. Schimmel & Co., Leipzig.\r\nThe oil distilled by them was examined in Prof. Fittig’s laboratory,\r\nStrassburg.\r\n\r\nThe investigations of several chemists, performed in 1878-79 in\r\nFittig’s laboratory, have shown the oil to contain the following\r\nconstituents:—At 147-148° C. _isobutylic ethers_ and hydrocarbons\r\nare distilling, at 177° _angelicate_ of _isobutyl_, at 200°-201°\r\n_angelicate_ of _isamyl_, at 204°-205° _tiglinate_ of _isamyl_ (both\r\nthese compound ethers answering to the formula C₅H₇O·OC₅H₁₁). In the\r\nresidual portion hexylic alcohol, C₆H₁₃OH, and an alcohol of the\r\nformula C₁₀H₁₆O, are met with, both probably occurring in the form\r\nof compound ethers. By decomposing the angelicates and the tiglinate\r\nabove named with potash, angelic acid, C₅H₈O₂, and tiglinic (or\r\nmethylcrotonic) acid, isomeric to the former, are obtained to the\r\nextent of about 30 or more per cent. of the crude oil. In the oil\r\nexamined by Fittig, angelic acid was prevailing; from another specimen\r\nE. Schmidt (1879) obtained but very little of it, tiglinic acid was by\r\nfar prevailing (see also article Oleum Crotonis).\r\n\r\nWe have performed some experiments in order to isolate the _bitter\r\nprinciple_, but have not succeeded in obtaining it in a satisfactory\r\nstate of purity; it forms a brown extract, apparently a glucoside. We\r\ncan also confirm the statement that no alkaloid is present.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—An infusion or an extract of chamomile is often used as a bitter\r\nstomachic and tonic.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration and Substitution=—The flowerheads of _Matricaria\r\nChamomilla_ L., designated in Germany _Common Chamomiles_ (_gemeine\r\nKamillen_), are sometimes asked for in this country. In aspect as well\r\nas in odour, they are very different from the chamomiles of English\r\npharmacy; they are quite single, not bitter, and have the receptacle\r\ndevoid of scales and hollow.\r\n\r\nA cultivated variety of _Chrysanthemum Parthenium_ Pers., or Feverfew,\r\nwith the florets all ligulate, and some scales on the receptacle\r\n(not having the receptacle _naked_, as in the wild form), common in\r\ngardens,[1427] has flowerheads exceedingly like double chamomiles. But\r\nthey may be distinguished from the latter by their _convex_ or _nearly\r\nflat_ receptacle, with the scales lanceolate and acute, and less\r\nmembranous.\r\n\r\nThe chamomiles of the Indian bazaars which are brought from Persia\r\nand known as _Bābūnah_, are (as we infer from the statement of Royle)\r\nthe flowers of _Matricaria suaveolens_ L., a slender form of _M.\r\nChamomilla_, growing in Southern Russia, Persia, Southern Siberia, also\r\nin North America.\r\n\r\nThe fresh wild plant of _Anthemis nobilis_ L., pulled up from the\r\nground, is sold in London for making extract, a proceeding highly\r\nreprehensible supposing the extract to be sold for medicinal use.\r\n\r\n[1427] Is not this plant the _Anthemis? parthenioides_ Bernh., of which\r\nDe Candolle says (_Prod._ vi. 7)—“ ... simillima _Mat.

It is found in the salt\r\nmarshes of the British Islands, on the coasts of the Baltic, of France\r\nand the Mediterranean, and on saline soils in Hungary and Podolia;\r\nthence it extends eastward, covering immense tracts in Southern Russia,\r\nthe regions of the Caspian, and Central Siberia, to Chinese Mongolia.\r\n\r\nThe particular variety which furnishes at least the chief part of the\r\ndrug, is a low, shrubby, aromatic plant, distinguished by its very\r\nsmall, erect, ovoid flowerheads, having oblong, obtuse, involucral\r\nscales, the interior scales being scarious. The stem in its upper\r\nhalf is a fastigiate, thyrsoid panicle, crowned with flowerheads. The\r\nlocalities for the plant are the neighbourhood of the Don, the regions\r\nof the lower Volga near Sarepta and Zaritzyn, and the Kirghiz deserts.\r\n\r\nThe drug, which consists of the minute, unopened flowerheads, is\r\ncollected in large quantities, as we are informed by Björklund (1867),\r\non the vast plains or steppes of the Kirghiz, in the northern part of\r\nTurkestan. It was formerly gathered about Sarepta, a German colony in\r\nthe Government of Saratov, but from direct information we have (1872)\r\nreceived, it appears to be obtained there no longer.\r\n\r\nThe emporium for wormseed is the great fair of Nishnei-Novgorod\r\n(July 15th to Aug. 27th), whence the drug is conveyed to Moscow, St.\r\nPetersburg, and Western Europe.\r\n\r\nWormseed is found in the Indian bazaars. A specimen received by us from\r\nBombay does not materially differ in form from the Russian drug, but is\r\nslightly shaggy and mixed with tomentose stalks. It is probably brought\r\nfrom Afghanistan and Cabul.[1431]\r\n\r\nWilkomm[1432] has described, as mother plant of wormseed, an\r\n_Artemisia_ which he calls _A. Cina_. It was obtained in Turkestan\r\nby Prof. Petzholdt, who received it from the people gathering the\r\ndrug. The specimen kindly communicated to us by Prof. Willkomm has\r\nflowerheads which do not entirely resemble the wormseed of trade, in\r\nthat they have fewer scales, but their number may be somewhat varying.\r\n\r\n[1428] From the Italian _semenzina_, the diminutive of _semenza_ (seed).\r\n\r\n[1429] W. S. Besser in _Bulletin de la Soc. imp. des Naturalistes de\r\nMoscou_, vii. (1834) 31.—A specimen of the plant in question labelled\r\nin Besser’s handwriting, with a memorandum that it is collected for\r\nmedicinal use, is in the Herbarium of the Royal Gardens, Kew. It\r\ncompletely agrees with the _Semen Cinæ_ of Russian and German commerce.\r\nThis remark also applies to a specimen of _A. Lercheana_ Karel. et\r\nKiril. in the same herbarium.\r\n\r\n[1430] “Si aliæ Artemisiæ multùm variant, Seriphidia inconstantiâ\r\nformarum omnes superant....”—Besser.\r\n\r\n[1431] _Artemisia_ No. 3201, Herb. Griffith, Afghanistan, in the Kew\r\nHerbarium has capitules precisely agreeing with this Bombay drug.\r\n\r\n[1432] _Bot. Zeitung_, 1 März 1872. 130; _Pharm. Journ._ 23 March 1872.\r\n772 (abstract).\r\n\r\n=History=—Several species of _Absinthium_ are mentioned by Dioscorides,\r\none of which called Ἀψίνθιον Θαλάσσιον or Σέριϕον, having very small\r\nseeds (capitules), and growing in Cappadocia, he states to be taken\r\nin honey as a remedy for ascarides and lumbrici: one can hardly doubt\r\nbut that this is the modern wormseed. Another species is described by\r\nthe same author as being called Σαντόνιον, from its growing in the\r\ncountry of the Santones in Gaul (the modern Saintonge); he asserts it\r\nto resemble σέριϕον in its properties.\r\n\r\nIn an epistle on intestinal worms attributed to Alexander\r\nTrallianus,[1433] who practised medicine with great success at Rome in\r\nthe 6th century, the use is recommended of a decoction of _Absinthium\r\nmarinum_ (θαλασσία ἀψίνθη) as a cure for ascarides and round worms.\r\n\r\n_Semen sanctum vel Alexandrinum_ is mentioned as a vermifuge for\r\nchildren by Saladinus about A.D. 1450, and by Ruellius, Dodonæus,\r\nthe Bauhins, and other naturalists of the 16th century. Tragus[1434]\r\nmentions that it is imported by way of Genoa. Its ancient reputation\r\nhas been fully maintained in modern times, and in the form partly of\r\n_Santonin_, the drug is still extensively employed.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Good samples of the drug consist almost exclusively of\r\nentire, unopened flowerheads or capitules, which are so minute that\r\nit requires about 90 to make up the weight of one grain. In samples\r\nless pure, there is an admixture of stalks, and portions of a small\r\npinnate leaf. The flowerheads are of an elliptic or oblong form, about\r\n⅒ of an inch long, greenish yellow when new, brown if long kept; they\r\ngrow singly, less frequently in pairs, on short stalks, and are formed\r\nof about 18 oblong, obtuse, concave scales, closely imbricated. This\r\ninvolucre is much narrowed at the base in consequence of the lowermost\r\nscales being considerably shorter than the rest. The capitule is\r\nsometimes associated with a few of the upper leaves of the stem, which\r\nare short, narrow, and simple. Notwithstanding its compactness, the\r\ncapitule is somewhat ridged and angular,[1435] from the involuclar\r\nscales having a strong, central nerve or keel. The middle portion of\r\neach scale is covered with minute, yellow, sessile glands, which are\r\nwanting on the transparent scarious edge. The latter is marked with\r\nextremely fine striæ and is quite glabrous; in the young state the\r\nkeel bears a few woolly colourless hairs, but at maturity the whole\r\nflowerhead is shining and nearly glabrous.[1436] The florets number\r\nfrom 3 to 5; they have (in the bud) an ovoid corolla, glandular in its\r\nlower portion, a little longer than the ovary, which is destitude of\r\npappus.\r\n\r\n[1433] Contained in a work by Hieronymus Mercurialis, entitled\r\n_Variarum Lectionum libri quatuor_, Venet. 1570; also in Puschmann’s\r\nedition of _Alexander_ (see Appendix), i. 238. 240.\r\n\r\n[1434] In Brunfels (_De vera herbarum cognitione_), Argentorati, 1531.\r\n196.\r\n\r\n[1435] Maceration in water, which restores the natural shape of the\r\nflowerheads, shows that this shrunken, angular form is not found in the\r\ngrowing plant.\r\n\r\n[1436] Yet too much stress must not be laid on this character, for\r\nas Besser remarks—“_periclinii squamæ in uno loco tomento brevi plus\r\nminusve canæ, in aliis nudæ, imo nitidæ_.”\r\n\r\nWormseed when rubbed in the hand exhales a powerful and agreeable\r\nodour, resembling cajuput oil and camphor; it has a bitter aromatic\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Wormseed yields from 1 to 2 per cent. of\r\nessential oil, having its characteristic smell and taste. The oil\r\nis slightly levogyrate and chiefly consists of the liquid C₁₀H₁₈O,\r\naccompanied by a small amount of hydrocarbon. The former has the odour\r\nof the drug, yet rather more agreeable; sp. gr. 0·913 at 20° C. It\r\nboils without decomposition at 173°-174°, but in presence of P₂O₅ or\r\nP₂S₅ abundantly yields cymol (see p. 333). The latter had already been\r\nobserved by Völckel (1854) under the name of _cinene_ or _cynene_, yet\r\nhe assigned to it the formula C₁₂H₉; Hirzel (1854) called it cinæbene.\r\n\r\nThe water which distills over carries with it volatile acids of the\r\nfatty series, also _angelic acid_ (see pp. 313, 386).\r\n\r\nThe substance to which the remarkable action of wormseed on the human\r\nbody[1437] is due is _Santonin_, C₁₅H₁₈O₃. It was discovered in 1830 by\r\nKahler, an apothecary of Düsseldorf, who gave a very brief notice of\r\nit in the _Archiv der Pharmacie_ of Brandes (xxxiv. 318). Immediately\r\nafterwards Augustus Alms, a druggist’s assistant at Penzlin in the\r\ngrand duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, knowing nothing of Kahler’s\r\ndiscovery, obtained the same substance and named it _Santonin_. Alms\r\nrecommended it to the medical profession, pointing out that it is the\r\nanthelminthic principle of wormseed.[1438] Santonin constitutes from 1½\r\nto 2 per cent. of the drug, but appears to diminish in quantity very\r\nconsiderably as the flowers open. It is easily extracted by milk of\r\nlime, for, though not an acid and but sparingly soluble in water even\r\nat a boiling heat, it is capable of combining with bases. With lime it\r\nforms then santoninate of calcium, which is readily soluble in water.\r\nOn addition of hydrochloric acid, santoninic acid, C₁₅H₂₀O₄, separates,\r\nbut parts with OH₂, santonin being thus immediately reproduced. Similar\r\nfacts have been recorded with regard to alantic acid (see p. 381).\r\n\r\nSantonin forms crystals of the orthorhombic system, melting at 170°,\r\nwhich are inodorous, but have a bitter taste, especially when dissolved\r\nin chloroform or alcohol.[1439] They are colourless, but when exposed\r\nto daylight, or to the blue or violet rays, but not to the other\r\ncolours of the spectrum, they assume a yellow hue, and split into\r\nirregular fragments. This change, which takes place even under water,\r\nalcohol or ether, is not accompanied by any chemical alteration.\r\nThis behaviour of santonin when exposed to light, resembles that of\r\nerythrocentaurin, C₂₇H₂₄O₈. The latter has been obtained by means of\r\nether, from the alcoholic extract of _Erythræa Centaurium_, and of\r\nsome other _Gentianaceæ_. Méhu (1866) has shown that the colourless\r\ncrystals of that substance when exposed to sunlight, assume a\r\nbrilliant red colour, _without_ undergoing any chemical alteration.\r\nThe _colourless_ solutions of this body in chloroform or alcohol yield\r\nthe original substance. Yet as to santonin, Sestini and Cannizzaro\r\n(1876) have shown, that its dilute alcoholic solution, on long exposure\r\nto sunlight, affords a compound ether of photosantonic acid, namely\r\nC₁₅H₁₃O₄(C₂H₅)₂.\r\n\r\n[1437] As the affected vision, so that objects appear as if seen\r\nthrough a yellow medium. Other effects are recorded by Stillé\r\n(_Therapeutics and Mat. Med._ ii. 641).\r\n\r\n[1438] The paper of Alms being contained in the very same periodical\r\n(p. 319) as that of Kahler (and further in vol. xxxix. 190), affords\r\nadditional evidence of the independence of the discovery.\r\n\r\n[1439] Its ready solubility in 3 or 4 parts of chloroform renders its\r\nestimation easy when mixed with sugar, as in a santonin lozenge.\r\n\r\nWormseed contains, in addition to the above described bodies, resin,\r\nsugar, waxy fat, salts of calcium and potassium, and malic acid; when\r\ncarefully selected and dried, it yielded us 6·5 per cent. of ash, rich\r\nin silica.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Ludwig of St. Petersburg has stated that the imports of\r\nwormseed into that city were about as follows:—In 1862, 7400 cwt.; in\r\n1863, 10,500 cwt.; in 1864, 11,400 cwt. The drug was brought from the\r\nKirghiz steppes by Semipalatinsk and by Orenburg.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The drug is employed exclusively for its anthelminthic\r\nproperties, partly in the form of santonin. It proves of special\r\nefficacy for the dislodgement of _Ascaris lumbricoides_.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX ARNICÆ.\r\n\r\n_Rhizoma Arnicæ_, _Arnica Root_; F. _Racine d’Arnica_; G.\r\n_Arnicawurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Arnica montana_ L., a perennial plant growing in\r\nmeadows throughout the northern and central regions of the northern\r\nhemisphere, but not reaching the British Islands. In western and\r\ncentral Europe it is an inhabitant of the mountains, but in colder\r\ncountries it grows in the plains.\r\n\r\nIn high latitudes, as in Arctic Asia and America, a peculiar form of\r\nthe plant distinguished by narrow, almost linear leaves has been named\r\n_A. angustifolia_ Vahl; but numerous transitional forms prove its\r\nidentity with the ordinary _A. montana_ of Europe.\r\n\r\n=History=—The older botanists as Matthiolus, Gesner, Camerarius,\r\nTabernæmontanus, and Clusius were acquainted with Arnica and had some\r\nknowledge of its medicinal powers, which appear to have been expressly\r\nrecommended, towards the end of the 16th century, by Franz Joël,\r\nprofessor of Greifswald, Germany.[1440] All parts of the plant were no\r\ndoubt popular remedies in Germany at an early period, but Arnica was\r\nonly introduced into regular medicine on the recommendation of Johann\r\nMichael Fehr of Schweinfurt and of several other physicians.[1441] But\r\nfor enthusiastic laudation of the new remedy, all these writers fall\r\nfar short of Collin of Vienna, who imagined that in Arnica he had found\r\na European plant possessing all the virtues of Peruvian Bark.[1442] In\r\nhis hands fevers and agues gave way under its use, and more than 1000\r\npatients in the Pazman Hospital were alleged to have been cured of\r\nintermittents by an electuary of the flowers, between 1771 and 1774.\r\nSuch happy results were not obtained by other physicians.\r\n\r\n[1440] Sprengel, _Geschichte der Arzneykunde_, iv.

(1779) 133.\r\n\r\nArnica (_herba_, _flos_, _radix_) had a place in the London\r\nPharmacopœia of 1788, but it soon fell out of notice, so that Woodville\r\nwriting in 1790, remarks that he had been unable to procure the\r\nplant from any of the London druggists. Of late years it has gained\r\nsome popular notoriety as an application in the form of tincture,\r\nfor preventing the blackness of bruises, but in England it is rarely\r\nprescribed internally.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The arnic root of pharmacy consists of a slender,\r\ncontorted, dark brown rootstock, an inch or two long, emitting from its\r\nunder side an abundance of wiry simple roots, 3, 4 or more inches in\r\nlength; it usually bears the remains of the rosette of characteristic,\r\novate, coriaceous leaves, which are 3-to 5-nerved, ciliated at the\r\nmargin, and slightly pubescent on their upper surface. It has a faintly\r\naromatic, herby smell, and a rather acrid taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—On a transverse section, the rootstock exhibits\r\na large pith surrounded by a strong woody ring. In the innermost part\r\nof the cortical layer, large oil-ducts are found corresponding to the\r\nfibro-vascular bundles. Neither starch granules, inulin, or oxalate\r\nof calcium are visible in the tissue. The rootlets are of a different\r\nstructural character, but also contain oil-ducts.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Several chemists have occupied themselves\r\nin endeavouring to isolate the active principle of arnica. Bastick\r\ndescribed (1851) a substance which he obtained in minute quantity from\r\nthe flowers and named _Arnicine_. He states it to possess alkaline\r\nproperties, to be non-volatile, slightly soluble in water, more so in\r\nalcohol or ether; when neutralized with hydrochloric acid, it forms a\r\ncrystalline salt.\r\n\r\nThe _Arnicin_ extracted by Walz (1861) both from the root and flowers\r\nof arnica is a different substance; it is an amorphous yellow mass of\r\nacrid taste, slightly soluble in water, freely in alcohol or ether,\r\nand dissolving also in alkaline solutions. It is precipitable from its\r\nalcoholic solution by tannic acid or by water. Walz assigns to arnicin\r\nthe formula C₂₀H₃₀O₄; other chemists that of C₃₅H₅₄O₇. Arnicin has not\r\nyet been proved a glucoside, although it is decomposed by dilute acids.\r\n\r\nSigel (1873) obtained from dried arnica root about ½ per cent.\r\nof essential oil, and 1 per cent. from the fresh; the oil of the\r\nlatter had a sp. gr. of 0·999 at 18° C. The oil was found to be a\r\nmixture of various bodies, the principle being _dimethylic ether of\r\nthymohydroquinone_\r\n\r\n           {OCH₃\r\n    C₁₀H₁₂ {     , boiling at about 235°.\r\n           {OCH₃\r\n\r\nThe water from which the oil separates contains _isobutyric acid_,\r\nprobably also a little _angelic_ and _formic acid_; but neither\r\ncapronic nor caprylic acid, which had been pointed out by Walz.\r\n\r\nArnica root contains _inulin_, which Dragendorff extracted from it to\r\nthe extent of about 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Arnica is used chiefly in the form of tincture as a popular\r\napplication to bruises and chilblains; internally it is occasionally\r\nprescribed as a stimulant and diaphoretic.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Arnica root has been met with[1443] adulterated with\r\nthe root of _Geum urbanum_ L., a common herbaceous plant of the order\r\n_Rosaceæ_. The latter is thicker than the rhizome of arnica, being\r\n³/₁₀ to ⁴/₁₀ of an inch in diameter; it is a true _root_, furnished on\r\nall sides with rootlets, and has an _astringent_ taste. The leaves of\r\n_Geum_ are pinnate and quite unlike those of arnica.\r\n\r\n[1443] Holmes in _Pharm. Journ._, April 11, 1874. 810.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORES ARNICÆ.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—See preceding article.\r\n\r\n=History=—The flowers probably in the first line attracted the\r\nattention of popular medicine in Germany, as we pointed out, page 390.\r\n\r\n=Description=—_Arnica montana_ produces large, handsome, orange-yellow\r\nflowers, solitary at the summit of the stem or branches. The involucral\r\nscales of the capitulum (20 to 24) are of equal length, but are\r\nimbricated, forming a double row. They are very hairy, the shorter\r\nhairs being tipped with viscid glands. The receptacle is chaffy, ¼ of\r\nan inch in diameter, with about 20 ligulate florets, and of tubular\r\na much larger number. The ligulate florets, an inch in length, are\r\noblong, toothed at the apex, and traversed by about 10 parallel veins.\r\nThe achenes are brown and hairy, crowned by pappus consisting of a\r\nsingle row of whitish barbed hairs.\r\n\r\nThe receptacle is usually inhabited by a fly, _Trypeta arnicivora_\r\nLöw[1444]; the Pharmacopœia Germania (1872) therefore ordered the\r\nflorets to be deprived of the involucre and receptacle—“flosculi a\r\nperanthodio liberati.” From a chemical point of view the usefulness of\r\nthis direction may be doubted.\r\n\r\n[1444] Figured in Nees von Esenbeck’s _Plantæ medicinales_, Düsseldorf,\r\nii. (1833) fol. 39.\r\n\r\nArnica flowers have a weak, not unpleasant odour; they were formerly\r\nused in making the tincture, but as the British Pharmacopœia now\r\ndirects that preparation to be made with the root, they have almost\r\ngone out of use in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The flowers appear to be rather richer in\r\narnicin than the root, and are said to be equal if not superior to it\r\nin medicinal powers; yet the essential oil they contain is not the\r\nsame. It is obtained in but extremely small amount and has a greenish\r\nor blue coloration. Hesse (1864) has proved that the flowers are devoid\r\nof a peculiar volatile alkaloid which had been supposed to be present\r\nin them.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX TARAXACI.\r\n\r\n_Dandelion Root_, _Taraxacum Root_; F. _Pissenlit_; G.\r\n_Löwenzahnwurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Taraxacum officinale_ Wiggers _T. Dens-leonis_\r\nDesf., _Leontodon Taraxacum_ L., a plant of the northern hemisphere,\r\nfound over the whole of Europe, Central and Northern Asia, and\r\nNorth America, extending to the Arctic regions. It varies under a\r\nconsiderable number of forms, several of which have been regarded as\r\ndistinct species. In many districts it is a troublesome weed.\r\n\r\n=History=—Though the common Dandelion is a plant which must have been\r\nwell known to the ancients, no indubitable reference to it can be\r\ntraced in the classical authors of Greece and Italy; it is thought\r\nthat ἀθάκη of Theophrast and others means it. The word _Taraxacum_ is\r\nhowever usually regarded as of Greek origin;[1445] we have first met\r\nwith as _Tarakhshagun_ in the works of the Arabian physicians, who\r\nspeak of it as a sort of _Wild Endive_. It is thus mentioned by Rhazes\r\nin the 10th, and by Avicenna in the 11th century.\r\n\r\nThe name _Dens Leonis_, an equivalent of which is found in nearly\r\nall the languages of Europe, is stated in the herbal of Johann von\r\nCube[1446] to have been bestowed on this plant by one Wilhelm, a\r\nsurgeon, who held it in great esteem; but of this personage and of the\r\nperiod during which he lived we have sought information in vain, and we\r\nmay remember that Dens Leonis (“Dant y Llew”) is already met with in\r\nthe Welsh medicine of the 13th century.[1447]\r\n\r\nDandelion was also much valued as medicine in the time of Gerarde and\r\nParkinson, and is still extensively employed.\r\n\r\n=Collection=—In England, taraxacum root is considered to be in\r\nperfection for extract in the month of November, the juice at that\r\nperiod affording an ampler and better product than at any other.\r\nBentley contends that it is more bitter in March, and most of all in\r\nJuly, and that at the former period at least it should be preferred.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The root is perennial, and tapering, simple, or slightly\r\nbranched, attaining in a good soil a length of a foot or more, and half\r\nan inch to an inch in diameter. Old roots divide at the crown into\r\nseveral heads. The root is fleshy and brittle; externally of a pale\r\nbrown, internally white, and abounding in an inodorous milky juice of\r\nbitter taste. It shrinks very much in drying, losing in weight about 76\r\nper cent.[1448]\r\n\r\nDried dandelion root is half an inch or less in thickness, dark\r\nbrown, shrivelled with wrinkles running lengthwise often in a spiral\r\ndirection; when quite dry, it breaks easily with a short corky\r\nfracture, showing a very thick white bark, surrounding a woody column.\r\nThe latter is yellowish, very porous, without pith or rays. A rather\r\nbroad but indistinct cambium-zone separates the wood from the bark,\r\nwhich latter exhibits numerous well-defined concentric layers. The root\r\nhas a bitterish taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—On the longitudinal section, especially\r\nin a tangential direction, the brownish zones are seen to contain\r\nlaticiferous vessels, only about 2 mkm. in diameter. These traverse\r\ntheir zones in a vertical direction, giving off numerous lateral\r\nbranches, which however remain always confined to their zone. Within\r\neach of these zones, the lacticiferous vessels form consequently an\r\nanastomosing net. We may say that the root is thus vertically traversed\r\nby about 10 to 20 concentric rings of lacticiferous vessels.[1449] They\r\nmay be made beautifully evident by means of anilin-blue, with which\r\na thin longitudinal section of the fresh root may be moistened. The\r\nroot must be allowed to partially dry, but only till the milky juice\r\ncoagulates; the thin slice then energetically absorbs the colouring\r\nmatter.[1450]\r\n\r\n[1445] Perhaps from τράζυνον or τρόξμνον signifying _Wild Lettuce_;\r\naccording to some, from τάραξις, a disease of the eye which the plant\r\nwas used to cure, or from the verb τάρασσω, _I disturb_.\r\n\r\n[1446] _Herbarius zu teutsch und von aller handt kreuteren_, Augspurg,\r\n1488. cap. clii.\r\n\r\n[1447] The _Physicians of Myddvai_, 284 (see Appendix).\r\n\r\n[1448] Thus 5496 lb. of the washed root afforded of dry only 1277\r\nlb., or 23·2 per cent.—Information communicated by Messrs.

The woody part of\r\ntaraxacum root is made up of large scalariform vessels accompanied by\r\nparenchymatous tissue, the former much prevailing.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The fresh milky juice of dandelion is bitter\r\nand neutral, but it soon acquires an acid reaction and reddish brown\r\ntint, at the same time coagulating with separation of masses of what\r\nhas been called by Kromayer (1861), _Leontodonium_. This chemist, by\r\ntreating this substance with hot water, obtained a bitter solution\r\nyielding an active (?) principle to animal charcoal, from which it was\r\nremoved by means of boiling spirit of wine. After the evaporation of\r\nthe alcohol, Kromayer purified the liquid by addition of basic acetate\r\nof lead, saturation of the filtered solution with sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nand evaporation to dryness. The residue then yielded to ether an acrid\r\nresin, and left a colourless amorphous mass of intensely bitter taste,\r\nnamed by Kromayer _Taraxacin_. Polex (1839) obtained apparently the\r\nsame principle in warty crystals; he simply boiled the milky juice with\r\nwater and allowed the concentrated decoction to evaporate.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the “_Leontodonium_,” not dissolved by water, yields to\r\nalcohol a crystalline substance, Kromayer’s _Taraxacerin_, C₈H₁₆O. It\r\nresembles lactucerin and has in alcoholic solution an acrid taste. How\r\nfar the medicinal value of dandelion is dependent on the substances\r\nthus extracted, is not yet known.\r\n\r\nDragendorff (1870) obtained from the root gathered near Dorpat in\r\nOctober and dried at 100° C., 24 per cent. of _Inulin_ and some sugar.\r\nThe root collected in March from the same place yielded only 1·74 per\r\ncent. of inulin, 17 of uncrystallizable sugar and 18·7 of _Levulin_.\r\nThe last named substance, discovered by Dragendorff, has the same\r\ncomposition as inulin, but dissolves in cold water; the solution tastes\r\nsweetish, and is devoid of any rotatory power. Inulin is often to be\r\nseen as a glistening powder when extract of taraxacum is dissolved in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nT. and H. Smith of Edinburgh (1849) have shown that the juice of the\r\nroot by a short exposure to the air undergoes a sort of fermentation\r\nwhich results in the abundant formation of _Mannite_, not a trace of\r\nwhich is obtainable from the perfectly fresh root. Sugar which readily\r\nunderwent the vinous fermentation was found by the same chemists in\r\nconsiderable quantity.\r\n\r\nThe leaves and stalks of dandelion (but not the roots) were found by\r\nMarmé (1864) to afford the _Inosite_, C₆H₁₂O + 2 OH.\r\n\r\nThe root collected in the meadows near Bern immediately before\r\nflowering, carefully washed and dried at 100° C., yielded us 5·24 per\r\ncent. of ash, which we found to consist of carbonates, phosphates,\r\nsulphates, and in smaller quantity also of chlorides.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Taraxacum is much employed as a mild laxative and tonic,\r\nespecially in hepatic disorders.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The roots of _Leontodon hispidus_ L. (Common Hawkbit)\r\nhave occasionally been supplied by fraudulent herb-gatherers in place\r\nof dandelion. Both plants have runcinate leaves, but those of hawkbit\r\nare hairy, while those of dandelion are smooth. The (fresh) root of the\r\nformer is tough, breaking with difficulty and rarely exuding any milky\r\njuice.[1451]\r\n\r\nThe dried root of dandelion is exceedingly liable to the attacks of\r\nmaggots, and should not be kept beyond one season.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBA LACTUCÆ VIROSÆ.\r\n\r\n_Prickly Lettuce_; F. _Laitue vireuse_; G. _Giftlattich_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Lactuca virosa_ L.,[1452] a tall herb occurring\r\non stony ground, banks and roadsides, throughout Western, Central and\r\nSouthern Europe. It is abundant in the Spanish Peninsula and in France,\r\nbut in Britain is only thinly scattered, reaching its northern limit in\r\nthe south-eastern Highlands of Scotland.\r\n\r\n=History=—The introduction of this lettuce into modern medicine is due\r\nto Collin (the celebrated physician of Vienna, mentioned in our article\r\non Rad. Arnicæ, p. 390), who about the year 1771 recommended the\r\ninspissated juice in the treatment of dropsy. In long standing cases,\r\nthis extract was given to the extent of half an ounce a day.\r\n\r\nThe College of Physicians of Edinburgh inserted _Lactuca virosa_ L.\r\nin their pharmacopœia of 1792, while in England its place was taken\r\nby the Garden Lettuce, _L. sativa_ L. The Authors of the _British\r\nPharmacopœia_ of 1867 have discarded the latter, and directed that\r\n_Extractum Lactucæ_ shall be prepared by inspissating the juice of _L.\r\nvirosa_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The plant is biennial, producing in its first year\r\ndepressed obovate undivided leaves, and in its second a solitary\r\nupright stem, 3 to 5 feet high, bearing a pinacle of small, pale yellow\r\nflowers, resembling those of the Garden Lettuce. The stem, which is\r\ncylindrical and a little prickly below, has scattered leaves growing\r\nhorizontally; they are of a glaucous green, ovate-oblong, often\r\nsomewhat lobed, auricled, clasping, with the margin provided with\r\nirregular spinescent teeth, and midrib white and prickly. The whole\r\nplant abounds in a bitter, milky juice of strong, unpleasant, opiate\r\nsmell.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—We are not aware of any modern chemical\r\nexamination having been made of _Lactuca virosa_. The more important\r\nconstituents of the plant are those found in _Lactucarium_, to the\r\narticle on which the reader is referred.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The inspissated expressed juice of the fresh plant is reputed\r\nnarcotic and diuretic, but is probably nearly inert.\r\n\r\n[1451] Giles, _Pharm. Journ._ xi. (1851) 107.\r\n\r\n[1452] Bentham unites this plant with _L. Scariola_ L., but in most\r\nworks on botany they are maintained as distinct species.\r\n\r\n\r\nLACTUCARIUM.\r\n\r\n_Lactucarium_, _Lettuce Opium_, _Thridace_;[1453] F. and G.\r\n_Lactucarium_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—The species of _Lactuca_ from which lactucarium is\r\nobtained, are three or four in number, namely—\r\n\r\n1. _Lactuca virosa_ L., described in the foregoing article.\r\n\r\n2. _L. Scariola_ L., a plant very nearly allied to the preceding\r\nand perhaps a variety of it, but having the foliage less abundant,\r\nmore glaucous, leaves more sharply lobed, much more erect and almost\r\nparallel with the stem. It has the same geographical range as _L.\r\nvirosa_.\r\n\r\n3. _L. altissima_ Bieb., a native of the Caucasus, now cultivated in\r\nAuvergne in France for yielding lactucarium. It is a gigantic herb,\r\nhaving when cultivated a height of 9 feet and a stem 1½ inches in\r\ndiameter. Prof. G. Planchon believes it to be a mere variety of _L.\r\nScariola_ L.\r\n\r\n4. _L. sativa_ L., the common Garden Lettuce.[1454]\r\n\r\n=History=—Dr. Coxe of Philadelphia was the first to suggest that\r\nthe juice of the lettuce, collected in the same manner as opium is\r\ncollected from the poppy, might be usefully employed in medicine. The\r\nresult of his experiments on the juice which he thus obtained from\r\nthe garden lettuce (_L. sativa_ L.), and called _Lettuce Opium_, was\r\npublished in 1799.[1455]\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Coxe were continued some years later by Duncan,\r\nYoung, Anderson, Scudamore and others in Scotland, and by Bidault\r\nde Villiers and numerous observers in France. The production of\r\nlactucarium in Auvergne was commenced[1456] by Aubergier, pharmacien of\r\nClermont-Ferrand, about 1841.\r\n\r\n=Secretion=—All the green parts of the plant are traversed by a\r\nsystem of vessels, which when wounded, especially during the period\r\nof flowering, instantly exude a white milky juice. The stem, at first\r\nsolid and fleshy but subsequently hollow, owes its rigidity to a circle\r\nof about 30 fibro-vascular bundles, each of which includes a cylinder\r\nof cambium. At the boundary between this tissue and the primary\r\ncortical parenchyme, is situated the system of milk-vessels, exhibiting\r\non transverse section a single or double circle of thin-walled tubes,\r\nthe cavities of which contain dark brown masses of coagulated juice.\r\nIn longitudinal section, they appear branched and transversely bound\r\ntogether, as in the milk-vessels of taraxacum. The larger of these\r\ntubes, 35 mkm. in diameter, correspond pretty regularly in position\r\nwith the vascular bundles. Each of the latter is also separated from\r\nthe pith by a band or arch of cambium, in the circumference of which\r\nisolated smaller milk-vessels occur.\r\n\r\nThe system of milk-vessels[1457] is therefore double, belonging to\r\nthe pith on the one side, and to the bark on the other, the two being\r\nseparated by juiceless wood. The milk-vessels of the bark are covered\r\nby only 2 to 6 rows of parenchyme-cells of the middle bark, rapidly\r\ndecreasing in size from within outwards, and these are protected by a\r\nnot very thick-walled epidermis. Hence it is easy to understand how the\r\nslightest puncture or incision may reach the very richest milk-cells.\r\n\r\n[1453] The term Thridace is also applied to _Extract of Lettuce_.\r\n\r\n[1454] The authors of the French _Codex_ of 1866 name as the source of\r\nlactucarium that form of the garden lettuce which has been called by\r\nDeCandolle _Lactuca capitata_. Maisch has obtained lactucarium from _L.\r\nelongata_ Mühl. (_Am. Journ. of Pharm._ 1869. 148).\r\n\r\n[1455] Inquiry into the comparative effects of the _Opium officinarum_,\r\nextracted from the _Papaver somniferum_ or _White Poppy_ of Linnæus,\r\nand that procured from the _Lactuca sativa_ or _Common cultivated\r\nLettuce_ of the same author.—_Transact. of the American Philosophical\r\nSociety_, iv.

The\r\nintroduction of this industry is due to Mr. Goeris, apothecary of that\r\nplace, to whom we are indebted for the following information, and for\r\nsome further particulars, to Mr. Meurer of Zell.\r\n\r\nThe plant is grown in gardens, where it produces a stem only in its\r\nsecond year. In May just before it flowers, its stem is cut off at\r\nabout a foot below the top, after which a transverse slice is taken\r\noff daily until September. The juice, which is pure white but readily\r\nbecomes brown on the surface, is collected from the wounded top by\r\nthe finger, and transferred to hemispherical earthen cups, in which\r\nit quickly hardens so that it can be turned out. It is then dried in\r\nthe sunshine until it can be cut into four pieces, when the drying is\r\ncompleted by exposure to the air for some weeks on frames.\r\n\r\nAt Zell, 300 to 400 kilogrammes (661 to 882 lb.) of lactucarium\r\nare annually produced; the whole district furnishes at best but 20\r\nquintals annually. The price the drug fetches on the spot varies from\r\n4 to 10 thalers per kilogramme (about 6_s._ to 14_s._ per lb.) In the\r\nEifel district, where lactucarium was formerly collected, none is now\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nAs found in trade, German lactucarium consists of angular pieces formed\r\nas already described, but rendered more or less shrunken and irregular\r\nby loss of moisture and by fracture. Externally they are of a dull\r\nreddish-brown, internally opaque and wax-like, and when recent, of a\r\ncreamy white. By exposure to the air, this white becomes yellow and\r\nthen brown. Lactucarium has a strong unpleasant odour, suggestive of\r\nopium, and a very bitter taste.\r\n\r\nThe lactucarium produced by Aubergier of Clermont-Ferrand is of\r\nexcellent quality, but does not appear to differ from that obtained\r\non the Mosel, except that it is in circular cakes about 1½ inches in\r\ndiameter, instead of in angular lumps.\r\n\r\nScotch lactucarium, which was formerly the only sort found in the\r\nmarket, is still (1872) met with. Mr. Fairgrieve, who produces it in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Edinburgh, collects the juice into little tin\r\nvessels, in which it quickly thickens; it is then turned out and dried\r\nwith a gentle heat, the drug being broken up as the process of drying\r\ngoes on. It is thus obtained in irregular earthy-looking lumps of a\r\ndeep brown hue, of which the larger may be about an inch in length. In\r\nsmell, it exactly resembles the drug collected on the Continent.[1458]\r\n\r\n[1458] We are indebted to Mr. H. C. Baildon for a specimen of Scotch\r\nlactucarium collected about the year 1844, and to Messrs. T. and H.\r\nSmith for a sample of Mr. Fairgrieve’s article.\r\n\r\nWe have also before us Austrian lactucarium, prepared at Waidhofen on\r\nthe Thaya, where about 35 kilogrammes are annually produced. It is in\r\nfine tears of vigorous smell.\r\n\r\nWe are unacquainted with Russian lactucarium, which has been quoted at\r\na very high price in some continental lists.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Lactucarium is a mixture of very different\r\norganic substances, together with 8 to 10 per cent. of inorganic\r\nmatter. It is not completely taken up by any solvent, and when heated\r\nmerely softens but does not melt. Nearly half the weight of lactucarium\r\nconsists of a substance called _Lactucerin_ or _Lactucon_, which in our\r\nopinion is closely allied to if not identical with similar substances\r\noccurring in numerous milky juices. Lactucerin as afforded by the drug\r\nunder examination is probably a mixture of several bodies. It may be\r\nobtained by exhausting lactucarium with boiling alcohol sp. gr. 0·830;\r\nit is deposited in crystals, which when duly purified have the form of\r\nslender colourless, microscopic needles. Lactucerin is an inodorous,\r\ntasteless substance, insoluble in water, but dissolving in ether and in\r\noils both fixed and volatile, not quite so readily either in benzol, or\r\nin bisulphide of carbon. We found it to melt at 232° C. and to agree\r\nwith the formula C₁₉H₃₀O; Franchimont (1879) assigns to it the formula\r\nC₁₄H₂₄O, melting point 296°.\r\n\r\nEuphorbon (see Euphorbium), echicerin (see Cortex Alstoniæ),\r\ntaraxacerin (p. 394), the cynanchol, C₁₅H₂₄O, extracted in 1875 by\r\nButtleroff from _Cynanchum acutum_ L., are remarkably analogous to\r\nlactucerin.\r\n\r\nIn the lactucarium of Zell, we further met with a large amount of a\r\nsubstance which is readily soluble in bisulphide of carbon. It is an\r\namorphous mass, melting below 100°, separating from alcohol as a syrupy\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nCold alcohol, as well as boiling water, takes out of lactucarium\r\nabout 0·3 per cent. of a crystallizable bitter substance, _Lactucin_,\r\nC₁₁H₁₂O₃H₂O, which although it reduces alkaline cupric tartrate, is\r\nnot a glucoside. It may be best obtained by means of dialyse. Lactucin\r\nforms white pearly scales, readily soluble in acetic acid, but\r\ninsoluble in ether. It loses its bitterness when treated with an alkali.\r\n\r\nFrom the mother-liquors that have yielded lactucin, Ludwig, in\r\n1847, obtained _Lactucic Acid_, as an amorphous light yellow mass,\r\nbecoming crystalline after long standing. Lastly lactucarium has\r\nfurther afforded in small quantity an amorphous substance named\r\n_Lactucopicrin_, C₄₄H₆₄O₂₁, apparently produced from lactucin by\r\noxidation; it is stated by Kromayer (1862) to be soluble in water or\r\nalcohol, and to be very bitter.\r\n\r\nOf the widely diffused constituents of plants, lactucarium contains\r\ncaoutchouc (40-50 per cent.), gum, oxalic, citric, malic and succinic\r\nacids, sugar, mannite, and asparagin, together with potassium, calcium\r\nand magnesium salts of nitric and phosphoric acids. We obtained\r\ncrystals of nitrate of potassium by concentrating the aqueous decoction\r\nof lactucarium. On distillation with water, a volatile oil having the\r\nodour of lactucarium passes over in very small quantity.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The soporific powers universally ascribed in ancient times\r\nto the lettuce are supposed to exist in a concentrated form in\r\nlactucarium. Yet numerous experiments have failed to show that this\r\nsubstance possesses more than very slight sedative properties, if\r\nindeed it is not absolutely inert.[1459]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOBELIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBA LOBELIÆ.\r\n\r\n_Lobelia_, _Indian Tobacco_; F. _Lobelie enflée_; G. _Lobeliakraut_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Lobelia inflata_ L., an annual herb, 9 to 18\r\ninches high, with an angular upright stem, simple or more frequently\r\nbranching near the top, widely diffused throughout the eastern part\r\nof North America from Canada to the Mississippi, growing in neglected\r\nfields, along roadsides, and on the edges of woods, and thriving well\r\nin European gardens.\r\n\r\n=History=—_Lobelia inflata_ was described and figured by Linnæus[1460]\r\nfrom specimens cultivated by him at Upsala about 1741, but he does not\r\nattribute to the plant any medicinal virtues.\r\n\r\nThe aborigines of North America made use of the herb, which from this\r\ncircumstance and its acrid taste, came to be called _Indian Tobacco_.\r\nIn Europe it was noticed by Schöpf,[1461] but with little appreciation\r\nof its powers. In America it has long been in the hands of quack\r\ndoctors, but its value in asthma was set forth by Cutler in 1813. It\r\nwas not employed in England until about 1829, when, with several other\r\nremedies, it was introduced to the medical profession by Reece.[1462]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The leaves are 1 to 3 inches long, scattered, sessile,\r\novate-lanceolate, rather acute, obscurely toothed, somewhat pubescent.\r\nThe edge of the leaf bears small whitish glands, and between them\r\nisolated hairs which are more frequent on the under than on the upper\r\nsurface. They are usually in greater abundance on the lower and middle\r\nportions of the stem.\r\n\r\nThe stem of the growing plant exudes when wounded a small quantity of\r\nacrid milky juice, contained in laticiferous vessels running also into\r\nthe leaves. The inconspicuous blossoms are arranged in a many-flowered,\r\nterminal, leafy raceme. The five-cleft, bilabiate corolla is bluish\r\nwith a yellow spot on the under lip, its tube being as long as the\r\nsomewhat divergent limb of the calyx.\r\n\r\nThe capsule is ovoid, inflated, ten-ribbed, crowned by five elongated\r\nsepals which are half as long as the ripe fruit. The latter is\r\ntwo-celled, and contains a large number of ovate-oblong seeds about\r\n¹/₅₀ of an inch in length, having a reticulated, pitted surface.\r\n\r\nThe herb found in commerce is in the form of rectangular cakes, 1\r\nto 1¾ inches thick, consisting of the yellowish-green chopped herb,\r\ncompressed as it would seem while still moist, and afterwards neatly\r\ntrimmed. The cakes arrive wrapped in paper, sealed up and bearing the\r\nlabel of some American druggist or herb-grower.\r\n\r\n[1459] Stillé, _Therapeutics and Mat. Med._ i. (1868) 756. Garrod\r\n(_Med. Times and Gazette_, 26 March, 1864), gave lactucarium in drachm\r\ndoses, repeated 3 or 4 times a day, without being able to perceive that\r\nit had any effect either as an anodyne or hypnotic.\r\n\r\n[1460] _Acta Soc. Reg. Scient. Upsal._ 1746. 23.\r\n\r\n[1461] _Mat. Med. Americana_, Erlangæ, 1787. 128.\r\n\r\n[1462] _Treatise on the Bladder-podded Lobelia_, Lond. 1829.\r\n\r\nLobelia has a herby smell and, after being chewed, a burning acrid\r\ntaste resembling that of tobacco.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Lobelia has been examined by Procter, Pereira\r\n(1842), Reinsch (1843), Bastick (1851), also by F. F. Mayer.[1463]\r\nThe first-named chemist[1464] traced the activity of the plant to\r\nan alkaloid which he termed _Lobelina_, and his observations were\r\nconfirmed by the independent experiments of Bastick.[1465] Lewis (1878)\r\nobtained it by mixing the drug with charcoal and exhausting the powder\r\nwith water containing a little acetic acid. The liquid is cautiously\r\nevaporated to the consistency of an extract and triturated with\r\nmagnesia, from the excess of which the aqueous solution of lobeline is\r\nseparated by filtration. It is agitated with amylic alcohol (or ether),\r\nwhich by spontaneous evaporation affords the alkaloid. The latter is\r\nagain dissolved in water and filtered through animal charcoal; from the\r\ndried powder lobeline is to be removed by ether.\r\n\r\nLobeline is an oily, yellowish fluid with a strong alkaline reaction,\r\nespecially when in solution. In the pure state it smells slightly of\r\nthe plant, but more strongly when mixed with ammonia. Its taste is\r\npungent and tobacco-like, and when taken in minute doses, it exercises\r\nin a potent manner the poisonous action of the drug. Lobeline is to\r\nsome extent volatile, but its decomposition begins when it is heated to\r\n100° C. either pure or in presence of dilute acids or caustic alkalis.\r\nLobeline dissolves in water, but more readily in alcohol or ether, the\r\nlatter of which is capable of removing it from its aqueous solution.\r\nIt neutralizes acids, forming with some of them crystallizable salts,\r\nsoluble in water or alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe herb likewise contains traces of essential oil (the _Lobelianin_ of\r\nPereira?), resin and gum. The seeds afforded Procter about 30 per cent.\r\nof fixed oil, sp. gr. 0·940, which was found to dry very rapidly. The\r\n_Lobeliin_ of Reinsch appears to be an indefinite compound.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 Enders at our request performed some researches on Lobelia in\r\norder to isolate the acrid substance to which the herb owes its taste.\r\nHe exhausted the drug with spirit of wine and distilled the liquid in\r\npresence of charcoal, which then retained the acrid principle. The\r\ncharcoal was washed with water, and then treated with boiling alcohol.\r\nThis on evaporation yielded a green extract, which was further purified\r\nby means of chloroform. Warty tufts were thus finally obtained, yet\r\nalways of a brownish colour. The tufts are readily soluble in ether and\r\nchloroform, but only slightly in water; they possess the acrid taste of\r\nlobelia. This substance, which we may term _Lobelacrin_, is decomposed\r\nif merely boiled with water; by the influence of alkalis or acids it is\r\nresolved into sugar and _Lobelic Acid_. The latter is soluble in ether,\r\nwater, and alcohol, and is non-volatile; it yields a soluble salt with\r\nbaryum oxide, whereas its plumbic salt is insoluble in water.\r\n\r\n[1463] _American Journ. of Pharm._ xxxvii. (1866) 209; also\r\n_Jahresbericht_ of Wiggers and Husemann, 1866. 252.\r\n\r\n[1464] _Am. Journ. of Pharm._ iii. (1838) 98; vii. (1841) 1; _Pharm.\r\nJourn._ x. (1851) 456.\r\n\r\n[1465] _Pharm. Journ._ x. (1851) 270.\r\n\r\nLewis suggests that lobelacrin is nothing else than _lobeliate of\r\nlobeline_, which he believes to exist ready formed in the plant. From\r\na decoction of the drug, on addition of sulphate of copper, lobeliate\r\nof copper is precipitated. By decomposing the latter with sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, concentrating the solution and shaking it with warm ether,\r\nLewis obtained a yellow solution affording on evaporation a crystalline\r\nmass of lobelic acid.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Lobelia is a powerful nauseating emetic; in large doses an\r\nacro-narcotic poison. It is prescribed in spasmodic asthma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERICACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLIA UVÆ URSI.\r\n\r\n_Bearberry Leaves_; F. _Feuilles de Busserole_; G.\r\n_Bärentraubenblätter_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Arctostaphylos Uva-ursi_ Sprengel (_A. officinalis_\r\nWimmer et Grabowsky, _Arbutus Uva-ursi_ L.), a small, procumbent,\r\nevergreen shrub, distributed over the greater part of the northern\r\nhemisphere. It occurs in North America, Iceland, Northern Europe, and\r\nRussian Asia, and on the chief mountain chains of Central and Southern\r\nEurope. In Britain it is confined to Scotland, the north of England,\r\nand Ireland.\r\n\r\n=History=—The bearberry was used in the 13th century by the Welsh\r\n“Physicians of Myddfai,” described by Clusius in 1601, and recommended\r\nfor medicinal use in 1763 by Gerhard of Berlin and others.[1466] It had\r\na place in the London Pharmacopœia for the first time in 1788.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The leaves are dark green, ¾ to 1 inch in length by ²/₈\r\nto ⅜ of an inch in breadth, obovate, rounded at the end, gradually\r\nnarrowed into a short petiole. They are entire, with the margin a\r\nlittle reflexed, and in the young state slightly pubescent, otherwise\r\nthe whole leaf is smooth, glabrous, and coriaceous; the upper surface\r\nshining, deeply impressed with a network of veins; the under minutely\r\nreticulated with dark veins.[1467] The leaves have a very astringent\r\ntaste, and when powdered a tea-like smell.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Kawalier (1852) has shown that a decoction\r\nof bearberry treated with basic acetate of lead yields a gallate of\r\nthat metal, thus proving that gallic acid exists ready-formed in the\r\nleaves. When the filtrate, freed from lead by sulphuretted hydrogen, is\r\nproperly concentrated, it deposits acicular crystals of _Arbutin_, a\r\nbitter neutral substance, easily soluble in hot water, less so in cold,\r\ndissolving in alcohol, but sparingly in ether.\r\n\r\nBy contact for some days with emuslin, or by boiling with dilute\r\nsulphuric acid, arbutin is resolved, according to Hlasiwetz and\r\nHabermann (1875), as follows:—\r\n\r\n    C₂₅H₃₄O₁₄ + 2 OH₂ = C₆H₁₂O₆ · C₆H₄(OH)₂  ·  C₆H₄(OH·OCH₃)\r\n     Arbutin.          Glucose.  Hydrokinone.  Methyl-hydrokinone.\r\n\r\nYet possibly arbutin is a mixture of the glucoside compounds of both\r\nhydrokinone and methyl-hydrokinone.\r\n\r\n[1466] Murray, _Apparatus Medicaminum_, ii. (1794) 64-81.\r\n\r\n[1467] Microscopic structure of the leaves, see Pocklington, _Pharm.\r\nJourn._ v. (1874) 301.\r\n\r\nBy heating arbutin with peroxide of manganese and dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, on the other hand, _Kinone_, C₆H₄O₂, and formic acid are\r\nproduced. If a concentrated decoction of the leaves is allowed to stand\r\nfor some months, a decomposition of the arbutin takes place, and a\r\ncertain quantity of hydrokinone can be isolated by shaking the liquid\r\nwith ether.\r\n\r\nArbutin is apparently widely distributed among the plants belonging\r\nto the order Ericaceæ. Maisch in 1874 showed it to occur in\r\n_Arctostaphylos glauca_ Swindley, _Gaultheria procumbens_ L.\r\n(Wintergreen) and several other allied American plants. Kennedy (1875)\r\nisolated arbutin from _Kalmia latifolia_ L. (Spoonwood), where it\r\noccurs in smaller quantity than in bearberry leaves.\r\n\r\nKinic acid (see p. 363) is probably absent in all these plants\r\ncontaining arbutin.\r\n\r\nUloth (1859) had already noticed pyrocatechin (p. 244) and hydrokinone\r\namong the products of the distillation of an aqueous extract of\r\nbearberry leaves. Arbutin itself also yields hydrokinone by means of\r\ndry distillation. Hydrokinone forms colourless crystals, melting at\r\n169° C.\r\n\r\nIn the mother-liquor from which the arbutin has crystallized,\r\nthere remains a small quantity of the very bitter substance called\r\n_Ericolin_, occurring in greater abundance in Calluna, Ledum,\r\nRhododendron, and other _Ericaceæ_. _Ericolin_ is an amorphous\r\nyellowish mass, softening at 100° C. and resolved, when heated with\r\ndilute sulphuric acid, into sugar and _Ericinol_, a colourless,\r\nquickly resinifying oil of a peculiar, not disagreeable odour; its\r\ncomposition[1468] agrees with the formula C₁₀H₁₆O. The same, or\r\nC₂₀H₃₂O₂, is to be assigned to _Ursone_, which H. Trommsdorff, in\r\n1854, obtained from bearberry leaves by exhausting them with ether (in\r\nwhich however it is but slightly soluble). Ursone is a colourless and\r\ntasteless crystallizable substance. It melts at 200° C., and sublimes\r\napparently unchanged. Tonner (1866) met with it in the leaves of an\r\nAustralian _Epacris_, a plant of the same order as the bearberry.\r\n\r\n[1468] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, xvi. (1864). 28.\r\n\r\nLastly, tannic acid is present in the leaves under notice; their\r\naqueous infusion is nearly colourless, but assumes a violet hue on\r\naddition of ferrous sulphate. After a short time a reddish precipitate\r\nis produced, which quickly turns blue. By using ferric chloride, a\r\nbluish black precipitate immediately separates.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The leaves of _Vaccinium Vitis-idæa_ L., called _Red\r\nWhortleberry_ or _Cowberry_, have been confounded with those of\r\nbearberry, which in form they much resemble. But they are easily\r\ndistinguished by being somewhat crenate towards the apex, dotted and\r\nreticulate on the under surface and more revolate at the margin.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—An astringent tonic used chiefly in affections of the bladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEBENACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS DIOSPYRI.\r\n\r\n_Indian Persimmon._\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Diospyros Embryopteris_ Pers. (_Embryopteris\r\nglutinifera_ Roxb.), a middle-sized or large evergreen tree, native\r\nof the western coast of India, Ceylon, Bengal, Burma, Siam, and also\r\nJava.[1469]\r\n\r\n=History=—The tree, which is mentioned in the earliest epic poems of\r\nthe Sanskrit literature under the name of _tinduka_,[1470] was also\r\nknown about the year 1680 to Rheede, and was figured in his _Hortus\r\nMalabaricus_.[1471] The circumstance that the unripe fruit abounds in\r\nan astringent viscid juice which is used by the natives of India for\r\ndaubing the bottoms of boats, was communicated by Sir William Jones to\r\nRoxburgh in 1791. The introduction of the fruit into medicine, which is\r\ndue to O’Shaughnessy,[1472] has been followed by its admission to the\r\n_Pharmacopœia of India_, 1868.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit is usually solitary, subsessile or pedunculate,\r\nglobular or ovoid, 1½ to 2 inches long, and as much as 1½ inch in\r\ndiameter, surrounded at the base by a large and deeply 4-lobed calyx.\r\nIt is of a yellowish colour, covered with a rusty tomentum; internally\r\nit is pulpy, 6-to 10-celled, with thin flat solitary seeds. The\r\nfruit is used only in the unripe and fresh state; the pulp is then\r\nexcessively astringent. At maturity, in the month of April near Bombay,\r\nthe fruit becomes eatable, but is very little appreciated.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—No analysis has been made of this fruit, but\r\nthere can be no doubt that in common with that of other species of\r\n_Diospyros_, it is, when immature, rich in tannic acid. Charropin\r\n(1873),[1473] who has examined the fruit of the American _D.\r\nvirginiana_ L., found it to contain a tannic acid which he considered\r\nidentical with that of nutgalls, besides an abundance of pectin,\r\nglucose, and a yellow colouring matter insoluble in water but\r\ndissolving freely in ether.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The inspissated juice has been recommended as an astringent in\r\ndiarrhœa and chronic dysentery.\r\n\r\n[1469] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med.

The French expedition for the exploration of the\r\nMekong and Cochin China (1866-68), reported the drug to be produced\r\nin the cassia-yielding forests on the eastern bank of the river in\r\nquestion in about N. lat. 19°. Whether any benzoin is obtained from _S.\r\nFinlaysoniana_ Wall, as conjectured by Royle, we know not.\r\n\r\n=History=—There is no evidence that the Greeks and Romans,[1475] or\r\neven the earlier Arabian physicians, had any acquaintance with benzoin;\r\nnor is the drug to be recognized among the commodities which were\r\nconveyed to China by the Arab and Persian traders between the 10th and\r\n13th centuries, though the camphor of Sumatra is expressly named.\r\n\r\nThe first mention of benzoin known to us (disregarding the word\r\nkalanusari, which in the St. Petersburg Dictionary is given as the old\r\nSanskrit name of benzoin) occurs in the travels of Ibn Batuta,[1476]\r\nwho having visited Sumatra during his journey through the East, A.D.\r\n1325-49, notes that the island produces _Java Frankincense_ and\r\ncamphor. The word _Java_ was at that period a designation of Sumatra,\r\nor was even used by the Arabs to signify the islands and productions\r\nof the Archipelago generally.[1477] Hence came the Arabic name _Lubán\r\nJáwí_, i.e. _Java Frankincense_, corrupted into _Banjawi_, _Benjui_,\r\n_Benzui_, _Benzoë_ and _Benzoïn_, and into the still more vulgar\r\nEnglish _Benjamin_.\r\n\r\nWe have no further information about the drug until the latter half of\r\nthe following century, when we find a record that in 1461 the sultan\r\nof Egypt, Melech Elmaydi, sent to Pasquale Malipiero, doge of Venice,\r\na present of 30 _rotoli_ of _Benzoi_, 20 _rotoli_ of Aloes Wood, two\r\npairs of Carpets, a small flask of balsam (of Mecca), 15 little boxes\r\nof Theriaka, 42 loaves of Sugar, 5 boxes of Sugar Candy, a horn of\r\nCivet, and 20 pieces of Porcelain.[1478] Agostino Barberigo, another\r\ndoge of Venice, was presented in a similar manner in 1490 by the sultan\r\nof Egypt with 35 _rotoli_ of Aloes Wood, the same quantity of _Benzui_\r\nand 100 loaves of Sugar.[1479]\r\n\r\nAmong the precious spices sent from Egypt in 1476 to Caterina\r\nCornaro, queen of Cyprus, were 10 lb. of Aloes Wood and 15 lb. of\r\n_Benzui_.[1480] These notices indicate the high value set upon the drug\r\nwhen first brought to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of benzoin in Siam is noticed in the journal of the\r\nvoyage of Vasco da Gama,[1481] where, in enumerating the kingdoms of\r\nIndia, it is stated that Xarnaux (Siam[1482]) yields much benzoin worth\r\n3 _cruzados_, and aloes worth 25 _cruzados_ per _farazola_. According\r\nto the same record, the price of benzoin (_beijoim_) in Alexandria was\r\n1 _cruzado_ per _arratel_, half the value of aloes wood.\r\n\r\n[1475] Crawfurd suggests that the _Malabathrum_ of the ancients is\r\npossibly _benzoin_.—_Dict. of Indian Islands_, 1856. 50.\r\n\r\n[1476] _Voyages d’Ibn Batoutah_, traduit par Defrémery et Sanguinetti,\r\nParis, 1853-59. iv. 228. 240.\r\n\r\n[1477] Yule, _Book of Ser Marco Polo_, ii.

The chemists of that time submitted\r\nit, like many other substances, to dry distillation. Benzoic acid\r\noccasionally separating from the oily products (“_oleum Benzoës_”) was\r\nnoticed already by Nostredame,[1485] Rosello,[1486] Liebaut,[1487]\r\nBlaise de Vigenère,[1488] and others. It was a common pharmaceutical\r\npreparation, under the name of _Flores Benzoës_, since the 17th\r\ncentury.[1489]\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the 17th century, there was direct commercial\r\nintercourse between England and both Siam and Sumatra, an English\r\nfactory existing at Ayuthia (Siam) until 1623; and benzoin was\r\ndoubtless one of the commodities imported. The import duties levied\r\nupon it in England in 1635 amounted to 10_s._ per lb.[1490]\r\n\r\n=Production=—Benzoin is collected in Northern and Eastern Sumatra,\r\nespecially in the Batta country, lying southward of the state of\r\nAchin.[1491] The tree grows in plenty also in the highlands of\r\nPalembang in the south and its resin is collected. It is chiefly on\r\nthe coast regions that considerable plantations are found. Teysmann\r\nsaw the cultivation in the tracts of the river Batang Leko, the trees\r\nbeing planted about 15 feet apart. The benzoin from the interior is\r\nmostly from wild trees, which occur at the foot of the mountains at an\r\nelevation of 300 to 1000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe trees, which are of quick growth, are raised from seeds grown on\r\nthe [edges of?] rice-fields; they require no particular attention\r\nbeyond being kept clear of other plants, until about 6 or 7 years old,\r\nwhen they have trunks 6 to 8 inches in diameter, and are capable of\r\nyielding the resin. Incisions are then made in their stems, from which\r\nthere exudes a thick, whitish, resinous juice, which soon hardens by\r\nexposure to the air, and is carefully scraped off with a knife.\r\n\r\n[1483] Flückiger, _l.c._, page 14.\r\n\r\n[1484] Cardanus, _Les livres de la subtilité_, Paris, 1556 (first\r\nedition, 1550), page 160 _b._ states: “belzoi est de vil prix pour\r\nl’abondance.”\r\n\r\n[1485] _Excellent et moult utile opuscule à touts necessaire qui\r\ndesirent avoir cognoissance de plusieurs exquises receptes_, 1556.\r\n\r\n[1486] Alexii Pedemontani (or Hieron.

Mr. St. John, British Consul in Borneo, in an official\r\nreport on the trade of Brunai, dated from that place 29 January 1858,\r\nenumerates the various productions of the district, but does not name\r\nbenzoin.\r\n\r\nThe trees continue to yield at the rate of about three pounds per\r\nannum for 10 or 12 years, after which period they are cut down. The\r\nresin which exudes during the first three years is said to be fuller\r\nof white tears, and therefore of finer quality, than that which issues\r\nsubsequently, and is termed by the Malays _Head Benzoin_. That which\r\nflows during the next 7 or 8 years, is browner in colour and less\r\nvaluable, and is known as _Belly Benzoin_; while a third sort, called\r\n_Foot_, is obtained by splitting the tree and scraping the wood; this\r\nlast is mixed with much bark and refuse.[1492]\r\n\r\nBenzoin is brought for sale to the ports of Sumatra in large cakes\r\ncalled _Tampangs_, wrapped in matting. These have to be broken, and\r\nsoftened either by the heat of the sun or by that of boiling water, and\r\nthen packed into square cases which the resin is made to fill.\r\n\r\nThe only account of the collection of _Siam Benzoin_ is that given by\r\nSir R. H. Schomburgk, for some years British Consul at Bangkok.[1493]\r\nHe represents that the bark is gashed all over, and that the resin\r\nwhich exudes, collects and hardens between it and the wood, the former\r\nof which is then stripped off. This account is confirmed by the aspect\r\nof some of the Siam benzoin of commerce as well as by that of pieces\r\nof bark in our possession; but it is also evident that _all_ the Siam\r\ndrug is not thus obtained. Schomburgk adds, that the resin is much\r\ninjured and broken during its conveyance in small baskets on bullocks’\r\nbacks to the navigable parts of the Menam, whence it is brought down to\r\nBangkok.[1494]\r\n\r\nWhether benzoin owes its original fluidity to a volatile oil holding\r\nthe resin in solution, and its solidification to the volatilization\r\nof this oil, or whether the resin itself hardens by oxidation,—what\r\noccasions the remarkable diversity of aspect between the opaque and\r\nmilk-like, and the completely transparent resin, are questions to be\r\ninvestigated by some future observer.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Benzoin (always termed in English commerce _Gum\r\nBenjamin_) is distinguished as of two kinds, _Siam_ and _Sumatra_.\r\nEach sort occurs in various degrees of purity, and under considerable\r\ndifferences of appearance.\r\n\r\n1. _Siam Benzoin_—The most esteemed sort is that which consists\r\nentirely of flattened tears or drops, an inch or two long, of an\r\nopaque, milk-like, white resin, loosely agglutinated into a mass.\r\nMore frequently the mass is quite compact, consisting of a certain\r\nproportion of white tears of the size of an almond downwards, imbedded\r\nin a deep, rich amber-brown, translucent resin. Occasionally the\r\ntranslucent resin preponderates, and the white tears are almost\r\nwanting. In some packages, the tears of white resin are very small,\r\nand the whole mass has the aspect of a reddish-brown granite. There is\r\nalways a certain admixture of bits of wood, bark, and other accidental\r\nimpurities.\r\n\r\n[1492] The terms _Head_, _Belly_ and _Foot_, equivalent to our\r\nwords _superior_, _medium_ and _inferior_, are used in the East to\r\ndistinguish the qualities of many other commodities, as Borneo Camphor,\r\nEsculent Birds’-nests, Cardamoms, Galbanum, &c.\r\n\r\n[1493] This account must have been derived from others, for Sir R. H.\r\nSchomburgk never visited the region producing benzoin.\r\n\r\n[1494] _Pharm. Journ._ iii. (1862) 126.\r\n\r\nThe white tears when broken, display a stratified structure with layers\r\nof greater or less translucency. By keeping, the white milky resin\r\nbecomes brown and transparent on the surface.\r\n\r\nSiam benzoin is very brittle, the opaque tears showing a slightly waxy,\r\nthe transparent a glassy fracture. It easily softens in the mouth and\r\nmay be kneaded with the teeth like mastich. It has a delicate balsamic,\r\nvanilla-like, fragrance, but very little taste. When heated it evolves\r\na more powerful fragrance, together with the irritating fumes of\r\nbenzoic acid; its fusing point is 75° C. The presence of benzoic acid\r\nmay be shown by the microscopical examination of splinters of the resin\r\nunder oil of turpentine.\r\n\r\nSiam benzoin is imported in cubic blocks, which takes their form from\r\nthe wooden cases in which they are packed while the resin is still soft.\r\n\r\n2. _Sumatra Benzoin_—Prior to the renewal of direct commercial\r\nintercourse with Siam in 1853, this was the sort of benzoin most\r\ncommonly found in commerce.\r\n\r\nIt is imported in cubic blocks exactly like the preceding, from which\r\nit differs in its generally greyer tint. The mass however, when the\r\ndrug is of good quality, contains numerous opaque tears, set in a\r\ntranslucent, greyish-brown resin, mixed with bits of wood and bark.\r\nWhen less good, the white tears are wanting, and the proportion of\r\nimpurities is greater. We have even seen samples consisting almost\r\nwholly of bark. In odour, Sumatra benzoin is both weaker and less\r\nagreeable than the Siam drug, and generally falls short of it in\r\npurity[1495] and handsome appearance, and hence commands a much lower\r\nprice. The greyish-brown portion melts at 95°, the tears at 85° C.\r\n\r\nA variety of Sumatra benzoin is distinguished by the London\r\ndrug-brokers as _Penang Benjamin_ or _Storax-smelling Benjamin_. We\r\nhave seen it of very fine quality, full of white tears (some of them\r\ntwo inches long), the intervening resin being greyish.[1496] The odour\r\nis very agreeable, and perceptibly different from that of Siam benzoin,\r\nor the usual Sumatra sort. Whether this drug is produced in Sumatra\r\nand by _Styrax Benzoin_ we know not; but it is worthy of note that _S.\r\nsubdenticulata_ Miq., occurring in Western Sumatra, has the same native\r\nname (_Kajoe Kĕminjan_) as _S. Benzoin_, and that Miquel remarks of\r\nit—“_An etiam benzoiferum?_”[1497]\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Benzoin consists mainly of amorphous resins\r\nperfectly soluble in alcohol and in potash, having slightly acid\r\nproperties, and differing in their behaviour to solvents. If two parts\r\nof the drug are boiled with one part of caustic lime and 20 parts of\r\nwater, benzoin acid is removed. From the residue the excess of lime is\r\ndissolved by hydrochloric acid, and the remaining resins washed and\r\ndried. About one-third of them will be found readily soluble in ether,\r\nthe prevailing portion dissolves in alcohol, and a small amount remains\r\nundissolved.\r\n\r\n[1495] In the _Public Ledger_, May 2, 1874, the prices are quoted\r\nthus:—Siam Gum Benjamin, 1st and 2nd qualities, £10 to £28 per cwt.;\r\nSumatra, 1st and 2nd, £7 10_s._ to £12.\r\n\r\n[1496] There were 8 cases of this drug offered at Public Sale, 13 April\r\n1871.\r\n\r\n[1497] _Prod. Floræ Sumatranæ_, 1860. 474.\r\n\r\nBy distilling the resin of benzoin with ten times its weight of zinc\r\ndust, Ciamician (1878) chiefly obtained toluol, C₆H₅(CH₃).\r\n\r\nSubjected to dry distillation, benzoin affords as chief product\r\n_Benzoic Acid_, C₇H₆O₂, together with empyreumatic products, among\r\nwhich Berthelot has proved the presence (in Siam benzoin) of _Styrol_\r\n(p. 274). The latter has been obtained in 1874 by Theegarten from\r\nSumatra benzoë by distilling it with water. When the resin is fused\r\nwith potash, it is partly decomposed and then, according to Hlasiwetz\r\nand Barth (1866), yields among other products, protocatechuic acid\r\n(more than 5 per cent.), C₆H₃(OH)₂COOH, para-oxybenzoic acid,\r\nC₆H₄(OH)COOH, and pyrocatechin, C₆H₄(OH)₂.\r\n\r\n_Benzoic acid_ exists ready-formed in the drug to the extent of 14 to\r\n18 per cent.[1498] Although the acid dissolves in 12 parts of boiling\r\nwater, the resin in which it is imbedded precludes its complete\r\nextraction by this means. It is however easily accomplished by the\r\naid of an alkali, most advantageously by milk of lime, which does not\r\ncombine with the amorphous resins.\r\n\r\nBenzoin is not manifestly acted on by bisulphide of carbon, but if kept\r\nin contact with it for a month or two, very large colourless crystals\r\nof benzoic acid make their appearance. Brought into a warm room, the\r\ncrystals quickly dissolve, but are easily reproduced by exposure to\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nMost pharmacopœias require not the inodorous acid obtained by a wet\r\nprocess, but that afforded by sublimation, which contains a small\r\namount of fragrant empyreumatic products. The resin, when repeatedly\r\nsubjected to sublimation, affords as much as 14 per cent. of benzoic\r\nacid. It has long been known that the opaque white tears of benzoin are\r\nless rich in benzoic acid than the transparent brown resin in which\r\nthey lie. From the latter, S. W. Brown (1833) extracted 13 per cent.\r\nof impure acid, but from the former scarcely 8½ per cent. We are by no\r\nmeans sure that such difference is constant.\r\n\r\nBitter almond oil, which by oxidation yields benzoic acid, is wanting\r\nin benzoin. Very little volatile oil is in fact to be got; half a pound\r\nof the best Penang benzoin yielded us by distillation with water only a\r\nfew drops of an extremely fragrant oil (_styrol?_).\r\n\r\nFerric chloride imparts to an alcoholic solution of benzoin a dark\r\nbrownish green, which is not acquired under the same circumstances by\r\nthe aqueous decoction of the powdered resin. Benzoin dissolves in cold\r\noil of vitriol, forming a solution of splendid carmine hue, from which\r\nwater separates crystals of benzoic acid.\r\n\r\nKolbe and Lautemann in 1860 discovered in Siam and Penang benzoin\r\ntogether with benzoic acid, an acid of different constitution, which in\r\n1861 they recognized as _Cinnamic Acid_, C₉H₉O₂. Aschoff (1861) found\r\nin a sample of Sumatra benzoin, cinnamic acid only, of which he got\r\n11 per cent.; and in amygdaloid Siam and Penang benzoin only benzoic\r\nacid. In some samples of the latter, one of us (F.) has likewise met\r\nwith cinnamic acid. On triturating this sort with peroxide of lead and\r\nboiling the mixture with water, the odour of bitter almond oil, due to\r\nthe oxidation of cinnamic acid, is evolved.\r\n\r\n[1498] Löwe (1870) and Rump (1878) attempted to prove that the acid is\r\npartly present in the form of a compound, but they have not shown with\r\nwhich substance it is combined in the drug.\r\n\r\nThe simultaneous occurrence of benzoic and cinnamic acids, or the\r\nabsence of one or other of them in benzoin, is due to circumstances at\r\npresent unexplained. Rump is of the opinion that the last named acid\r\nexclusively is present in the Penang (or Sumatra) benzoin and that no\r\nvariety of the drug contains both those acids.\r\n\r\nRump (1878) treated Siam benzoic with caustic lime (see p. 407),\r\nprecipitated the benzoic acid with hydrochloric acid, and agitated the\r\nliquid with ether. The latter on evaporating afforded a mixture of\r\nbenzoic acid and _Vanillin_ (see article Vanilla).\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The statistics of Singapore,[1499] the great emporium of the\r\ncommerce of the Indian Archipelago, show the imports of Gum Benjamin\r\nin 1871 as 7442 cwt., of which quantity 6185 cwt. had been shipped\r\nfrom Sumatra and 405 cwt. from Siam. In 1877 only 1871 peculs (2227\r\ncwts.) were exported from Singapore. Penang, which is also a mart\r\nfor this drug was stated in 1871 to have received from Sumatra for\r\ntrans-shipment, 4959 cwt. of Gum Benjamin.\r\n\r\nPadang in Sumatra exported in 1870, 4303 peculs (5122 cwt.); and in\r\n1871, 4064 peculs (4838 cwt.) of benzoin.[1500]\r\n\r\nThe imports of Gum Benjamin into Bombay in the year 1871-72 were no\r\nless than 5975 cwt., and the exports 1043 cwt.[1501]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Benzoin appears to be nearly devoid of medicinal properties, and\r\nis but little employed. It is chiefly imported for use as incense in\r\nthe service of the Greek Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLEACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANNA.\r\n\r\n_Manna_; F. _Manne_; G. _Manna_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Fraxinus Ornus_ L. (_Ornus europæa_ Pers.), the\r\nManna-ash, is a small tree found in Italy, whence it extends northwards\r\nas far as the Canton of Tessin in Switzerland and the Southern Tyrol.\r\nIt also occurs in Hungary (Buda) and the eastern coasts of the\r\nAdriatic, in Greece, Turkey (Constantinople), in Asia Minor about\r\nSmyrna and at Adalia on the south coast. It grows in the islands of\r\nSicily, Sardinia and Corsica, and is found in Spain at Moxente in\r\nValencia.[1502] As an ornamental tree it has been introduced into\r\nCentral Europe, where it is often seen of greater dimensions, sometimes\r\nacquiring a height of about 30 feet. It blossoms in early summer,\r\nproducing numerous feathery panicles of dull white flowers which give\r\nit a pleasing appearance. The foliage exhibits great variation in shape\r\nof leaflets, even where the tree is uncultivated; and the fruits also\r\nare very diverse in form.\r\n\r\nIn some districts of Sicily, a little manna is obtained from the Common\r\nAsh, _F. excelsior_ L.\r\n\r\n[1499] _Blue Book_ for the Colony of the Straits Settlements,\r\nSingapore, 1872.\r\n\r\n[1500] _Consular Reports_, August 1873. 953.\r\n\r\n[1501] _Statement of the Trade and Navigation of the Presidency of\r\nBombay for 1871-72_, pt. ii. 26. 79.\r\n\r\n[1502] _Fraxinus Bungeana_ DC., a tree of Northern China, appears to be\r\nhardly distinct from _F. Ornus_.\r\n\r\n=History=—The name _Manna_, though originally applied to the aliment\r\nmiraculously provided for the sustenance of the ancient Israelites\r\nduring their journey to the Holy Land, has been used to designate other\r\nsubstances of distinct nature and origin. Of these, the best known and\r\nmost important is the saccharine exudation of _Fraxinus Ornus_ L.,\r\nwhich constitutes the _Manna_ of European medicine.\r\n\r\nIt appears evident[1503] that previous to the 15th century, the manna\r\nin Europe was imported from the East and was not that of the ash.\r\nRaffaele Maffei, called also Volaterranus, a writer who flourished\r\nin the second half of the 15th century, states that manna began to\r\nbe gathered in Calabria in his time, but that it was inferior to the\r\noriental.[1504] At this period the manna collected was that which\r\nexuded spontaneously from the leaves of the tree, and was termed _Manna\r\ndi foglia_ or _Manna di fronda_: that which flowed from the stem bore\r\nthe name of _Manna di corpo_ and was less esteemed. All such manna was\r\nvery dear.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the 16th century, the plan of making incisions in\r\nthe trunk and branches was resorted to, and although it was strenuously\r\nopposed even by legislative enactment, the more copious supplies which\r\nit enabled the collectors to obtain led it to being generally adopted.\r\nThe Ricettario Fiorentino of the year 1573[1505] states that the manna\r\n“fatta con arte,” _i.e._ obtained by incisions, came from Cosenza in\r\nCalabria and differed not little from Syrian “manna mastichina.”[1506]\r\n\r\n_Manna di foglia_ became in fact utterly unknown, so that Cirillo\r\nof Naples, writing in 1770, expresses doubt whether it ever had any\r\nexistence.[1507]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the history of manna-production in Sicily, there is\r\nthis curious fact, that near Cefalù there exists an eminence in the\r\nMadonia range, called _Gebelman_ or _Gibelmanna_, which in Arabic\r\nsignifies _manna-mountain_. This name is not of modern origin, but is\r\nfound in a diploma of the year 1082, concerning the foundation of the\r\nbishopric of Messina; and it has been held to indicate that manna was\r\nthere collected during the Saracenic occupation of Sicily, A.D. 827 to\r\n1070. We have not been successful in finding any evidence whether this\r\nsupposition is well founded. On the other hand, it is remarkable that\r\nno writer, so far as we know, mentions manna as a production of Sicily,\r\nbefore Paolo Boccone of Palermo, who, after naming many localities\r\nfor the drug in continental Italy, states that it is also obtained in\r\nSicily.[1508]\r\n\r\nManna was also produced until recently in the Tuscan Maremma, but\r\nneither from that locality, nor from the States of the Church, where it\r\nwas collected in the time of Boccone, is any supply now brought into\r\ncommerce, though the name of Tolfa, a town near Civita Vecchia, is\r\nstill used to designate an inferior sort of the drug.\r\n\r\nThe collection of manna in Calabria, which was imported up to the end\r\nof last century, has now almost entirely ceased.[1509]\r\n\r\n[1503] Hanbury, _Historical Notes on Manna_, _Pharm.

Journ._ Nov. 30. 1872. 421; _Science Papers_, 365.\r\n\r\n=Production=—The manna of commerce is collected at the present day\r\nexclusively in Sicily. The principal localities producing the drug\r\nare the districts around Capaci, Carini, Cinisi, and Favarota, small\r\ntowns 20 to 25 miles west of Palermo near the shores of the bay of\r\nCastellamare; also the townships of Geraci, Castelbuono, and other\r\nplaces in the district of Cefalù, 50 to 70 miles eastward of Palermo.\r\n\r\nThe manna-ash, in the districts whence the best manna is obtained, does\r\nnot at the present day form natural woods, but is cultivated in regular\r\nplantations called _frassinetti_. The trees, which attain a height of\r\nfrom 10 to 20 feet, are planted in rows and stand about 7 feet apart,\r\nthe soil between being at times loosened, kept free from weeds, and\r\nenriched by manure. After a tree is 8 years old and when its stem is at\r\nleast 3 inches in thickness, the gathering of manna may begin; and may\r\ncontinue for 10 or 12 years, when the stem is usually cut down, and a\r\nyoung one brought up from the same root takes its place. The same stump\r\nthus has often two or three stems rising from it.\r\n\r\nTo obtain manna, transverse cuts from 1½ to 2 inches long and 1 inch\r\napart, are made in the bark, just reaching to the wood. One cut is made\r\ndaily, beginning at the bottom of the tree, the second directly above\r\nthe first, and so on while dry weather lasts. In the following year,\r\ncuts are made in the untouched part of the stem, and in the same way\r\nin succeeding seasons. When after some years the tree has been cut all\r\nround and is exhausted, it is felled. Pieces of sticks or straws are\r\ninserted in the incisions, and become encrusted with the very superior\r\nmanna, called _Manna a cannolo_, which however is unknown in commerce\r\nas a special sort. The fine manna ordinarily seen appears to have\r\nhardened on the stem of the tree. The manna which flows from the lower\r\nincisions, and is often collected on tiles or on a cup-shaped piece of\r\nthe stem of the prickly pear (_Opuntia_), is less crystalline, and more\r\ngummy and glutinous, and is regarded of inferior quality.\r\n\r\nThe best time for notching the stems is in July and August, when the\r\ntrees have ceased to push forth more leaves. Dry and warm weather is\r\nessential for a good harvest. The manna after removal from the tree,\r\nis laid upon shelves in order that it may dry and harden before it is\r\npacked. The masses left adhering to the stem after the finer pieces\r\nhave been gathered, are scraped off and form part of the _Small Manna_\r\nof commerce.[1510]\r\n\r\n=Secretion=—We have examined microscopically the bark of stems of\r\n_Fraxinus Ornus_ that had been incised for manna at Capaci. It exhibits\r\nno peculiarity explaining the formation of manna, or any evidence that\r\nthe saccharine exudation is due to an alteration of the cell-walls\r\nas in the case of tragacanth. The bark is poor in tannic matter; it\r\ncontains starch, and imparts to water a splendid fluorescence due to\r\nthe presence of _Fraxin_.\r\n\r\n[1510] Our account of the production of manna has been derived from\r\nthe observations of Stettner, who visited Sicily in the summer of 1847\r\n(_Archiv der Pharm._ iii. 194; also Wiggers’ _Jahresbericht_, 1848.\r\n35; _Hooker’s Journ. of Bot._ i. 1849. 124), from those of Cleghorn\r\n(_Trans. of the Bot. Soc. of Edinburgh_, x. 1868-69. 132), and from\r\npersonal investigations made by one of us in the neighbourhood of\r\nPalermo in May 1872. See Hanbury, _Science Papers_, 367.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Various terms have been used by pharmacological writers\r\nto designate the different qualities of manna, but in English commerce\r\nthey are not now employed; and the better kinds of the drug are called\r\nsimply _Flake Manna_, while the smaller pieces, usually loosely\r\nagglutinated and sold separately, are termed _Small Manna_ or _Tolfa\r\nManna_.\r\n\r\nOwing to the gradual exudation of the juice and the deposition of one\r\nlayer over another, manna has a stalactitic aspect. The finest pieces\r\nare mostly in the form of three-edged sticks, sometimes as much as 6\r\nto 8 inches long and an inch or more wide, grooved on the inner side,\r\nwhich is generally soiled by contact with the bark; of a porous,\r\ncrystalline, friable structure and of a pale brownish yellow tint,\r\nbecoming nearly pure white in those parts which have been most distant\r\nfrom the bark of the tree. The pieces which are of deeper colour, and\r\nof an unctuous or gummy appearance, are less esteemed. Good manna is\r\ncrisp and brittle, and melts in the mouth with an agreeable, honey-like\r\nsweetness, not entirely devoid of traces of bitterness and acridity.\r\nIts odour may be compared to that of honey or moist sugar.\r\n\r\nManna of the best quality dissolves at ordinary temperatures in about\r\nsix parts of water, forming a clear, neutral liquid. It contains\r\nbesides mannite, a small proportion of sugar and gum.\r\n\r\nThe manna which exudes from the older stems and from the lower parts\r\nof even young trees, contains more or less considerable quantities\r\nof gum and fermentable sugar, as well as extraneous impurities. The\r\nless favourable weather of the later summer and autumn promotes an\r\nalteration in the composition of the juice, and impairs its property of\r\nconcreting into a crystalline mass.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The predominant constituent of manna, at least\r\nof the better sorts, is _Manna-sugar_ or _Mannite_, C₆H₈(OH)₆ which\r\nlikewise occurs, though in much smaller quantity, in many other plants\r\nbesides _Fraxinus_. Artificially, it is produced by treating glucose,\r\nC₆H₁₂O₆, with sodium amalgam, and indirectly in the fermentation of\r\nglucose or of cane-sugar. It is isomeric with dulcite or melampyrin;\r\ncrystallizes in shining prisms or tables, belonging to the rhombic\r\nsystem; melts at 166° C., and in very small quantity may by careful\r\nheating be sublimed and decomposed. It dissolves in 6·5 parts of water\r\nat 16° C., less freely in aqueous alcohol, very sparingly in absolute\r\nalcohol, and not in ether. The solution has an extremely weak rotatory\r\npower, and is not altered by boiling with dilute acids or alkalis, or\r\nwith alkaline cupric tartrate.\r\n\r\nBerthelot has shown that mannite is susceptible of fermentation, though\r\nnot so easily as sugars belonging to the group of carbo-hydrates. The\r\nquantity of mannite in the best manna varies from 70 to 80 per cent.\r\n\r\nWhen a solution of manna is mixed with alkaline cupric tartrate,\r\nrapid reduction to cuprous hydrate takes place even in the cold. This\r\neffect is due to the presence of a sugar which, according to Backhaus\r\n(1860), consists of ordinary dextro-glucose. It may amount to as\r\nmuch as 16 per cent., and is found in the best flake manna, but most\r\nabundantly in the unctuous varieties. Buignet[1511] has pointed out\r\nthat the rotatory power of this sugar being inconsiderable, it probably\r\nconsists of a mixture of _Cane-sugar_ and _Levulose_. He found however\r\nthat an aqueous solution of manna deviates powerfully to the right, a\r\nfact which he considers due to the presence of a large proportion of\r\n_Dextrin_. The best kinds of manna, according to Buignet, contain about\r\n20 per cent. of dextrin; the inferior much more.\r\n\r\n[1511] _Journ. de Pharm._ vii. (1867) 401; viii. (1868) 5.\r\n\r\nIn our experiments we have not succeeded in isolating either dextrin or\r\ncane-sugar. There is present, even in the finest manna, a small amount\r\nof a dextrogyre mucilage, which is precipitated by neutral acetate of\r\nlead, and yields mucic acid when boiled with concentrated nitric acid.\r\n\r\nEther extracts from an aqueous solution of manna a very small quantity\r\nof red-brown resin, having an offensive odour and sub-acrid taste;\r\ntogether with traces of an acid which reduces silver salts and appears\r\nto be easily resinified. The quantity of water in the inferior kinds\r\nof manna often amounts to 10 or 15 per cent. The finest manna affords\r\nabout 3·6 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\nThe greenish colour of certain pieces of manna was formerly attributed\r\nto the presence of copper, till Gmelin, on account of the fluorescence\r\nof the solution, ascribed it to _Æsculin_. It is in reality produced by\r\na body much resembling æsculin, namely _Fraxin_, C₁₆H₁₈O₁₀, occurring\r\nin the bark of the manna-ash and of the common ash, and together\r\nwith æsculin, in that of the horse-chestnut. Fraxin crystallizes in\r\ncolourless prisms, easily soluble in hot water and in alcohol, and\r\nhaving a faintly astringent and bitter taste. By dilute acids, it is\r\nresolved into _Fraxetin_, C₁₀H₈O₃, and _Glucose_, C₆H₁₂O₆. The presence\r\nof fraxin in manna, especially in the inferior sorts, is made apparent\r\nby the faint fluorescence of the alcoholic manna solution. The smallest\r\nfragment of the bark of the ash or the manna-ash immersed in water\r\ndisplays the same fluorescence.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The exports of manna from Sicily[1512] (chiefly from\r\nPalermo) have been as follows:—\r\n\r\n       1869              1870              1871\r\n     2546 cwt.,        1564 cwt.,        3038 cwt.,\r\n    val. £15,972.     val. £10,220.     val. £19,528.\r\n\r\nAbout half the quantity is sent to France. Italian commercial\r\nstatistics[1513] represent the export of manna in 1870 thus:—_in\r\ncanelli_ 58,691 kilo. (1155 cwt.), _in sorte_ 186,664 kilo. (3676\r\ncwt.). The United Kingdom imported in the year 1870, 230 cwt. of manna,\r\nvalued at £4447.[1514]\r\n\r\n[1512] _Report by Consul Dennis on the Commerce and Navigation of\r\nSicily in 1869, 1870 and 1871._\r\n\r\n[1513] Direzione generale delle Gabelle—_Movimento commerciale del\r\nregno d’Italia nel 1870_, Milano, 1871.\r\n\r\n[1514] _Annual Statement of the Trade and Navigation of the U.K. for\r\n1870_, p. 102.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 the exports of “canelli” from Messina were 4273 kilogrammes,\r\nand of the drug “in sorte” 52,874 kilogr.; total value, 127,145 lire.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—It can hardly be said that manna is subject to\r\nadulteration, though attempts to introduce a spurious manna made of\r\nglucose have been recorded. But considerable skill and ingenuity have\r\nbeen expended in converting the inferior sorts of manna into what has\r\nthe aspect of fine natural Flake Manna, the manufacturers admitting\r\nhowever the factitiousness of their product. The artificial Flake Manna\r\nhas the closest superficial resemblance to very fine pieces of the\r\nnatural drug, but differs in its more uniform colour, and in being\r\nuncontaminated with the slight impurities, from which natural manna is\r\nnever wholly free. It differs also in that when broken, no crystals of\r\nmannite are to be seen in the interstices of the pieces, and it wants\r\nthe peculiar odour and slightly bitter flavour of natural manna. If one\r\npart of it is boiled with four of alcohol (0·838), a viscid honey-like\r\nresidue will be obtained, whereas natural manna leaves undissolved a\r\nhard substance. Histed[1515] found it to afford about 40 per cent. of\r\nmannite, while fine manna similarly treated yielded 70 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—A gentle laxative, much less frequently employed in this country\r\nthan formerly, but still largely consumed in South America. Mannite,\r\nwhich possesses similar properties, is often prescribed in Italy.\r\n\r\nOther sorts of Manna.\r\n\r\nVarious plants besides _Fraxinus_ afford, under certain conditions,\r\nsaccharine exudations, some of which constituted the _Oriental Manna_\r\nused in Europe in early times. So far as is known, they differ from\r\nofficinal manna in containing no mannite.\r\n\r\n_Alhagi Manna_; _Turanjabín_ (Arabic); is afforded by _Alhagi\r\nCamelorum_ Fisch. (Hedysarum Alhagi Pallas, non L.), a small spiny\r\nplant of the order _Leguminosæ_ found in Persia, Afghanistan and\r\nBeluchistan. It had already been noticed by Isztachri.[1516] Excellent\r\nspecimens of the manna, kindly obtained for us in the north-west of\r\nIndia by Dr. E. Burton Brown and Mr. T. W. H. Tolbort, show it as a\r\nsubstance in little roundish, hard, dry tears, varying from the size\r\nof a mustard seed to that of a hemp seed, of a light brown colour,\r\nagreeable saccharine taste, and senna-like smell. The leaflets, spines\r\nand pods of the plant, mixed with the grains of this manna, are\r\ncharacteristic and easily recognizable.\r\n\r\nVilliers (1877) showed this manna to contain cane-sugar, a dextrogyrate\r\nglucose, and _melezitose_ (see further on: Briançon manna, page 416).\r\nLudwig[1517] had also found some dextrin and mucilage.\r\n\r\nAlhagi Manna is collected near Kandahar and Herat, where it is found\r\non the plants at the time of flowering. It is imported into India\r\nfrom Kabul and Kandahar to the extent of about 25 _maunds_ (2000 lb.)\r\nannually; its value is reckoned at 30 rupees per _secr_, = 30_s._ per\r\nlb.[1518]\r\n\r\n[1515] _On artificial Flake Manna_, in _Pharm.

This substance is _Tamarisk Manna_: it is\r\ncollected by the Arabs, and by them sold to the monks of St. Katharine,\r\nwho dispose of it to the pilgrims visiting the convent. Tamarisk Manna\r\nis also produced (but is perhaps no longer collected?) in Persia,\r\nwhere it is called _Gaz-angabín_;[1519] and probably likewise in the\r\nPunjab,[1520] from which regions it may have been brought to Europe in\r\nancient times.\r\n\r\nA specimen of tamarisk manna brought from Sinai, examined in 1861 by\r\nBerthelot, had the appearance of a thick yellowish syrup, contaminated\r\nwith vegetable remains. It was found to consist of cane-sugar, inverted\r\nsugar (lævulose and glucose), dextrin and water, the last constituting\r\none-fifth of the whole.[1521]\r\n\r\nAlthough the name _Gaz-angabín_ signifies _tamarisk-honey_, it is\r\nused according to Haussknecht[1522] at the present time in Persia, to\r\ndesignate certain round cakes, common in all the bazaars, of which the\r\nchief constituent is a manna collected in the mountain districts of\r\nChahar-Mahal and Faraidan, and especially about the town of Khonsar,\r\nsouth-west of Ispahan, from _Astragalus florulentus_ Boiss. et\r\nHaussk. and _A. adscendens_ Boiss. et Haussk. The best sorts of this\r\nmanna, which are termed _Gaz Alefi_ or _Gaz Khonsari_, are obtained\r\nin August by shaking it from the branches, the little drops finally\r\nsticking together and forming a dirty, greyish-white, tough mass. The\r\ncommoner sort got by scraping the stem, is still more impure. The\r\nspecimen of it brought by Haussknecht yielded to Ludwig[1523] dextrin,\r\nuncrystallizable sugar and organic acids.\r\n\r\n_Shir-khist_—Ancient writers on materia medica as Garcia d’Orta (1563)\r\nmention a sort of manna known by this name. The substance is still\r\nfound in the bazaars of North-western India, being imported in small\r\nquantity from Afghanistan and Turkistan.[1524] Haussknecht in his paper\r\non Oriental Manna already quoted, states that it is the exudation\r\nof _Cotoneaster nummularia_ Fisch. et Mey. (_Rosaceæ_), also of\r\n_Atraphaxis spinosa_ L. (_Polygonaceæ_), and that it is brought chiefly\r\nfrom Herat. We have to thank Dr. E. Burton Brown of Lahore, and Mr.\r\nTolbort for specimens of this manna, which, from fragments it contains,\r\nis without doubt derived from a _Cotoneaster_. It is in irregular\r\nroundish tears, from about ¼ up to ¾ of an inch in greatest length,\r\nof an opaque dull white, slightly clammy, and easily kneaded in the\r\nfingers. It has a manna-like smell, a pure sweet taste and crystalline\r\nfracture. With water, it forms a syrupy solution with an abundant\r\nresidue of starch granules.\r\n\r\nShír-khist was found by Ludwig to consist of an exudation analogous\r\nto tragacanth, but containing at the same time two kinds of gum, an\r\namorphous levogyre sugar, besides starch and cellulose.\r\n\r\n_Oak Manna_—The occurrence of a saccharine substance on the oak is\r\nnoticed by both Ovid and Virgil, and it is also mentioned by the\r\nArabian physicians, as Ibn Baytar[1525] and Elluchasem Elimithar.[1526]\r\nThe last named, who died A.D. 1052, states that the exudation appears\r\nupon the oaks in the region of Diarbekir. At the present day, it is\r\nthe object of some industry among the wandering tribes of Kurdistan,\r\nwho, according to Haussknecht, collect it from _Quercus Vallonea_\r\nKotschy and _Q. persica_ Jaub. et Spach. These trees are visited in the\r\nmonth of August by immense numbers of a small white _Coccus_, from the\r\npuncture of which a saccharine fluid exudes, and solidifies in little\r\ngrains. The people go out before sunrise, and shake the grains of manna\r\nfrom the branches on to linen cloths, spread out beneath the trees. The\r\nexudation is also collected by dipping the small branches on which it\r\nis formed, into vessels of hot water, and evaporating the saccharine\r\nsolution to a syrupy consistence, which in this state is used for\r\nsweetening food, or is mixed with flour to form a sort of cake.\r\n\r\n[1519] Angelus, _Pharm.

It constituted a moist soft mass of\r\nagglutinated tears, much resembling an inferior sort of ash-manna, and\r\nhad an agreeable saccharine taste.\r\n\r\nA less pure form of this manna occurs as a compact, greyish, saccharine\r\nmass, sometimes hard enough to be broken with a hammer. It consists\r\nof sugary matter, mixed with abundance of small fragments of green\r\nleaves, and has a herby smell and pleasant sweet taste. A sample of it\r\nbrought from Diarbekir, examined by one of us, yielded 90 per cent.\r\nof dextrogyre sugar, which could not be obtained in a crystalline\r\nstate, though it exists in such condition in the crude drug. Starch and\r\ndextrine were entirely wanting.[1527]\r\n\r\nA specimen furnished to Ludwig[1528] by Haussknecht afforded much\r\nmucilage, a small amount of starch, about 48 per cent. of dextrogyre\r\ngrape sugar, with traces of tannic acid and chlorophyll.\r\n\r\n_Briançon Manna_—This is a white saccharine substance which, in the\r\nheight of summer and in the early part of the day, is found adhering in\r\nsome abundance to the leaves of the larch (_Pinus Larix_ L.), growing\r\non the mountains about Briançon in Dauphiny. It was formerly collected\r\nfor use in medicine, but only to a very limited extent, for it was\r\nrare in Paris in the time of Geoffroy (1709-1731), and at the present\r\nday has quite disappeared from trade, though still gathered by the\r\npeasants. A specimen collected for one of us near Briançon in 1854,\r\nconsists of small, detached, opaque, white tears, many of them oblong\r\nand channelled, and encrusting the needle-like leaf of the larch; they\r\nhave a sweet taste and slight odour.[1529] Under the microscope they\r\nexhibit indistinct crystals.\r\n\r\nBriançon manna has been examined in 1858 by Berthelot, who detected\r\nin it a peculiar sugar termed _Melezitose_, answering to the formula\r\nC₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ + OH₂.\r\n\r\nSeveral other saccharine exudations have been observed by travellers\r\nand naturalists; we shall simply enumerate the more remarkable,\r\nreferring the reader for further information to the original notices.\r\n\r\n_Pirus glabra_ Boiss. affords in Luristan a substance which, according\r\nto Haussknecht, is collected by the inhabitants, and is extremely like\r\nOak Manna. It is stated by the same traveller that _Salix fragilis_\r\nL., and _Scrophularia frigida_ Boiss., likewise yield in Persia\r\nsaccharine exudations. A kind of manna was anciently collected from the\r\ncedar, _Pinus Cedrus_ L.[1530] Manna is yielded in Spain by _Cistus\r\nladaniferus_ L.[1531] _Australian Manna_, which is in small rounded,\r\nopaque, white, dry masses, is found on the leaves of _Eucalyptus\r\nviminalis_ Labill. It contains a kind of sugar called _Melitose_,[1532]\r\nhas a sweet thistle, is devoid of medicinal properties and is not\r\ncollected for use.[1533]\r\n\r\n[1527] Further particulars, see Flückiger, _Ueber die Eichenmanna von\r\nKurdistan_, in _Archiv der Pharmacie_, 200 (1872) 159.\r\n\r\n[1528] _Loc. cit._ p. 35.\r\n\r\n[1529] Hanbury, _Science Papers_, p. 438.\r\n\r\n[1530] Geoffroy, _Mat.

Yet in sealed tubes, they dissolve in 30 parts of\r\nwater at 135° C. The sugar is dextrogyre; it impregnates the threads\r\nas a soft brown amorphous mass. In the purified state it does not\r\ncrystallize, even after a long time. By means of dilute sulphuric acid,\r\nthe threads are converted into crystalline grape sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLEUM OLIVÆ.\r\n\r\n_Olive Oil_; _Salad Oil_; F. _Huile d’Olives_; G. _Olivenöl_; _Baumöl_;\r\n_Provencer Oel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Olea europæa_ L., an evergreen tree,[1537]\r\nseldom exceeding 40 feet in height, yet attaining extreme old age,\r\nabundantly cultivated in the countries bordering the Mediterranean,\r\nup to an elevation of about 2000 feet above the sea-level.[1538]\r\n_Olea ferruginea_ Royle (_O. cuspidata_ Wallich), a tree abundant in\r\nAfghanistan, Beluchistan and Western Sind, has been supposed to be\r\na wild form of _O. europæa_, but is regarded by Brandis[1539] as a\r\ndistinct species. It is not known to have been ever cultivated, yet its\r\nfruit, which is of a small size and but sparingly produced, is capable\r\nof affording a good oil.\r\n\r\n_History_—In ancient Egypt the olive was known by the term _bāk_; it\r\ncan be traced as far as the 17th century before our era.[1540]\r\n\r\nAccording to the elaborate investigations of Ritter[1541] and of\r\nA. De Candolle,[1542] the olive tree is a native of Palestine, and\r\nperhaps of Asia Minor and Greece. Its original area also extends over\r\nnorth-eastern Africa; Schweinfurth[1543] regards it as undoubtedly\r\nwild on the mountains of Elbe and Soturba in lat. 22 N. on the\r\nwestern shores of the Red Sea, a locality which he visited in 1868.\r\nThe olive tree has also been met with as far eastward as the country\r\nof the Gallas, where it is much appreciated as affording excellent\r\ntimber.[1544] It is also stated by Theophrastus, that in his time the\r\ntree was plentiful in the Cyrenaica, the modern Barca, in northern\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n[1534] _Comptes Rendus_, xlvi.

Willkomm (1876) is of the opinion\r\nthat it was originally a native of the whole Mediterranean region.\r\n\r\nAt the present day it is largely cultivated in Algeria, Spain,\r\nPortugal, Southern France, Italy, the Greek Peninsula and Asia Minor.\r\nIn the Crimea the tree grows well, but does not afford good fruit. It\r\nwas carried to Lima in Peru about 1560 and still flourishes there, and\r\nin great plenty in the coast valleys further south as far as Santiago\r\nin Chili.[1545]\r\n\r\nOlive oil is mentioned in the Bible so frequently that it must have\r\nbeen an important object with the ancient Hebrews. It held an equally\r\nprominent place among the Greeks and Romans,[1546] whose writers on\r\nagriculture and natural history treat of it in the most circumstantial\r\nmanner. Olive fruits preserved in brine were used by the Romans as an\r\narticle of food,[1547] and were an object of commerce with Northern\r\nEurope as early as the 8th century.[1548]\r\n\r\n=Production=—In common with many important cultivated plants, the\r\nolive occurs under several varieties differing more or less from\r\nthe wild form, the finer of which are propagated by grafting. It is\r\nalso increased by the suckers which old trees throw up from their\r\nnaked roots, and which are easily made to develope into separate\r\nplants.[1549] The fruit, an oval drupe, half an inch to an inch or more\r\nin length, and of a deep purple, is remarkable for the large amount of\r\nfat oil contained in its pulpy portion (sarcocarp). The latter is most\r\nrich in oil when ripe, containing then nearly 70 per cent., besides 25\r\nper cent. of water. The unripe fruit, as well as other parts of the\r\nplant, abounds in mannite, which disappears in proportion as the oil\r\nincreases. The ripe olive contains no mannite, it having probably been\r\ntransformed into fatty oil.[1550]\r\n\r\n[1545] Perez-Rosales, _Essai sur le Chili_, Hambourg, 1857. 133.\r\n\r\n[1546] Hehn, _Kulturpflanzen und Hausthiere in ihrem Uebergange\r\naus Asien nach Griechenland und Italien_, Berlin, 1877. 88-142,—an\r\ninteresting account of the importance of the olive in ancient times.\r\n\r\n[1547] Specimens may be seen among the antiquities found at Pompei.\r\n\r\n[1548] Diploma of Chilperic, A.D. 716.—Pardessus, _Diplomata_,\r\n_Chartæ_, etc., Paris, ii.

(1864) 65.—Some further\r\nresearches by Harz on the formation of olive oil may be found in the\r\n_Jahresbericht_ of Wiggers and Husemann (1870) 392.\r\n\r\nThe process for extracting olive oil varies slightly in different\r\ncountries, but consists essentially in subjecting the crushed pulp of\r\nthe ripe fruit to moderate pressure. The olives, which are gathered\r\nfrom the trees, or collected from the ground, in November, or during\r\nthe whole winter and early spring, are crushed under a millstone to\r\na pulpy mass. This is then put into coarse bags, which, piled upon\r\none another, are subjected to moderate pressure in a screw press.\r\nThe oil thus obtained is conducted into tubs or cisterns containing\r\nwater, from the surface of which it is skimmed with ladles. This is\r\ncalled _Virgin Oil_. After it has ceased to flow, the contents of the\r\nbags are shovelled out, mixed with boiling water, and submitted to\r\nstronger pressure than before, by which a second quality of oil is got.\r\nIf the fruit is left for a considerable time in heaps it undergoes\r\ndecomposition, yielding by pressure a very inferior quality of oil\r\ncalled in French _Huile fermentée_. The worst oil of all, obtained from\r\nthe residues, has the name of _Huile tournante_ or _Huile d’enfer_.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in some districts the millstones are so mounted as to\r\ncrush the pulp without breaking the olive-stones, and that thus the\r\noil of the pulp is obtained unmixed with that of the kernels.[1551]\r\nWe have made many inquiries in Italy and France as to this method of\r\noil-making, but cannot find that it is anywhere followed.\r\n\r\nThe fixed oil of the kernels of ripe olives has been extracted and\r\nexamined by one of us (F.). Though the kernels have a bitterish taste,\r\nthe oil they yield is quite bland; by exposure to the vapour of\r\nhyponitric acid, it concretes like that of the pulp. If the whole of it\r\nwere extracted in making olive oil, it would only be about as 1 part of\r\noil of the _kernel_, to 40 parts of oil of the _pulp_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Olive Oil is a pale yellow or greenish yellow, somewhat\r\nviscid liquid, of a faint agreeable smell and of a bland oleaginous\r\ntaste, leaving in the throat a slight sense of acridity.[1552] Its\r\nspecific gravity on an average is 0·916 at 17° C. In cold weather,\r\nolive oil loses its transparency by the separation of a crystalline\r\nfatty body. The deposition takes place at a few degrees above the\r\nfreezing point of water, and in some oils even at 10° C. (50° F.) If\r\nthe oil is allowed to congeal perfectly, and is then submitted to\r\nstrong pressure, about one-third of its weight of solid fat may be\r\nseparated. After repeated crystallizations, this fat melts at 20 to 28°\r\nC. The fluid part or _Olein_, continues fluid at -4° to -10° C. Olive\r\noil belongs to the class of the less alterable, non-drying oils.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing description does not apply to the inferior sorts of oil,\r\nwhich congeal more easily, are more or less deep-coloured, have a\r\ndisagreeable odour and taste, and quickly turn rancid. These inferior\r\noils have their special applications in the arts.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition-=-The chief constituent of olive oil is _Olein_\r\nor more correctly _Triolein_, C₃H₅(O·C₁₈H₃₃O)₃, identical so far as at\r\npresent ascertained with the fluid part of all oils of the non-drying\r\nclass. The proportion of olein in olive oil, as well as in other oils,\r\nis liable to variation, the result partly of natural circumstances and\r\npartly of the processes of manufacture. The best oils are rich in olein.\r\n\r\n[1551] _The Grocer_, April 25, 1868, supplement; Pereira, _Elem. of\r\nMat. Med._ ii. (1850) 1505.\r\n\r\n[1552] This according to our experience is the case even with oil as\r\nit runs from the pulp and therefore in the freshest condition; but the\r\nacrid after-taste is more perceptible in oil which has been long kept.\r\n\r\nAs to the solid part of olive oil, Chevreul believed it to be\r\nconstituted of _Margarin_, which he first examined in 1820. But\r\nHeintz (1852 and later) showed margarin to be a mixture of palmitin\r\nwith other compounds of glycerin and fatty acids. Collett in 1854\r\nisolated _Palmitic Acid_, C₁₆H₃₂O₂, from olive oil; and Heintz and Krug\r\n(1857) further proved that _Tripalmitin_ is the chief of the solid\r\nconstituents of olive oil. They also met with an acid melting at 71°·4\r\nC., which they regarded as _Arachic Acid_ (p. 187). As to stearic acid,\r\nHeintz and Krug did not fully succeed in evidencing its presence in\r\nolive oil.\r\n\r\nLastly, Benecke discovered in olive oil a small quantity of\r\n_Cholesterin_, C₂₆H₄₄O. It may be removed by means of glacial acetic\r\nacid or alcohol, which dissolve but very little of the oil.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Various sorts of olive oil are distinguished in the English\r\nmarket, as Florence, Gallipoli, Gioja, Spanish (Malaga and Seville),\r\nSicily, Myteline, Corfu and Mogador.\r\n\r\nOlive oil was imported into the United Kingdom in the year 1872 to\r\nthe value of £1,193,064. Nearly half the quantity was shipped from\r\nItaly, one-fifth from Spain, and the remainder from other Mediterranean\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe average annual production in Italy is estimated at about 3 millions\r\nof hectolitres (66 million gallons), but the quantity exported does not\r\nreach half that amount.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of the French Government indicate the annual production\r\nof olive oil in France to be not more than 250,000 hectolitres,\r\nequivalent in value to 30 millions of francs (£1,200,000).[1553]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The uses of olive oil in medicine and its immense consumption in\r\nthe warmer parts of Europe as an article of food, are too well known to\r\nrequire more than a passing allusion.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Olive Oil is the subject of various fraudulent\r\nadmixtures with less costly oils, the means of detecting which has\r\nengaged much attention. Of the various methods by which chemists have\r\nendeavoured to ascertain the purity of olive oil, the following are the\r\nmore noteworthy:—\r\n\r\n=a.= Drying oils (such as the oils of poppy and walnut) may be\r\ndistinguished by their not being converted into solid crystallizable\r\nelaidin by hyponitric acid or concentrated solution of nitrate of\r\nprotoxide of mercury. Olive oil which contains any considerable\r\nproportion of one of these oils, no longer solidifies if exposed for a\r\nmoment to one of the above-mentioned reagents. This test however is not\r\nof sufficient delicacy for small amounts of drying oils.\r\n\r\n=b.= Olive oil being one of the lighter oils, the specific gravity may\r\nto some degree indicate admixture with a heavier oil. To make use of\r\nthis fact, Gobley and other chemists have invented an instrument called\r\nan _elaiometer_, for taking the specific gravity of oils.\r\n\r\n=c.= Observation of the Cohesion-figure.—This test, proposed by\r\nTomlinson in 1864,[1554] depends on the forces of cohesion, adhesion,\r\nand diffusion. Thus, if a drop of any oil hanging from the end of a\r\nglass rod is gently deposited upon the surface of chemically clean\r\nwater, contained in a clean glass, a contest takes place between the\r\nforces in question the moment the drop flattens down by its gravity\r\nupon the surface of the water. The adhesion of the liquid surface tends\r\nto spread out the drop into a film, the cohesive force of the particles\r\nof the drop strives to prevent that extension, and the resultant of\r\nthese forces is a figure which Mr. Tomlinson believes to be definite\r\nfor every independent liquid. The figure thus produced is named the\r\n_cohesion-figure_.\r\n\r\n[1553] Exposition de 1867 à Paris, _Rapports du Jury International_,\r\nxi. 108.—In the work of Coutance, quoted p. 417, note 7, nearly 400,000\r\nhectolitres are calculated for the year 1866.\r\n\r\n[1554] _Pharm. Journ._ v. (1864) 387. 495, with figures.\r\n\r\nSo far as our experience goes, the processes hitherto recommended for\r\ntesting olive oil (and there are several that we have not mentioned)\r\nare only available in cases where the adulteration is considerable, and\r\nare quite insufficient for discovering a small admixture of other oils.\r\nHow little they are appreciated, may be inferred from the fact that the\r\nChamber of Commerce of Nice[1555] offered a reward of 15,000 francs\r\n(£600) for a simple and easy process for making evident an admixture\r\nwith olive oil of 5 per cent. at least of any seed-oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPOCYNEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CORTEX ALSTONIÆ.=\r\n\r\n_Cortex Alstoniæ scholaris_; _Dita Bark_;[1556] _Alstonia Bark_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Alstonia[1557] scholaris_ R. Brown (_Echites\r\nscholaris_ L.), a handsome forest tree, 50 to 90 feet in height, common\r\nthroughout the Indian Peninsula from the sub-Himalayan region to Ceylon\r\nand Burma; found also in the Philippines, Java, Timor and Eastern\r\nAustralia, likewise in Tropical Africa. It has oblong obovate leaves,\r\nin whorls of 5 to 7, and slender pendulous pods a foot or more in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n=History=—Saptachhada and saptaparna (literally seven-leaf), occurring\r\nin early Sanskrit epic poetry and also in Susruta, are ancient names\r\nof Alstonia (Dr. Rice). Rheede[1558] in 1678 and Rumphius[1559] in\r\n1741 described and figured the tree, and mentioned the use made of its\r\nbark by the native practitioners. Rumphius also explained the trivial\r\nname _scholaris_ as referring to slabs of the close-grained wood which\r\nare used as school-slates, the letters being traced upon them in sand.\r\nThe tonic properties of the bark were favourably spoken of by Graham\r\nin his _Catalogue of Bombay Plants_ (1839), and further recommended\r\nby Dr. Alexander Gibson in 1853[1560]. The drug has a place in the\r\n_Pharmacopœia of India_, 1868.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The drug, as presented to one of us by the late Dr.\r\nGibson and by Mr. Broughton of Ootacamund, consists of irregular\r\nfragments of bark, ⅛ to ½ an inch thick, of a spongy texture, easily\r\nbreaking with a short, coarse fracture. The external surface is very\r\nuneven and rough, dark grey or brownish, sometimes with blackish spots;\r\nthe interior substance and inner surface (liber) is of a bright buff.\r\nA transverse section shows the liber to be finely marked by numerous\r\nsmall medullary rays. The bark is almost inodorous; its taste is purely\r\nbitter and neither aromatic nor acrid.\r\n\r\n[1555] _Annales de Chimie et de Physique_, March, 1869. 309.\r\n\r\n[1556] From _Dita_, the name of the tree in the island of Luzon.\r\n\r\n[1557] So named in honour of Charles Alston, Professor of Botany and\r\nMateria Medica (1740-1760) in the University of Edinburgh.—The plant is\r\nfigured in Bentley and Trimen, _Med. Pl._ part 25 (1877).\r\n\r\n[1558] _Hortus Malabaricus_, i. tab. 45.\r\n\r\n[1559] _Herb. Amboin._ ii. tab. 82.\r\n\r\n[1560] _Pharm. Journ._ xii. (1853) 422.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The cortical tissue is covered with a thin\r\nsuberous coat; the middle layer of the bark is built up of a thin\r\nwalled parenchyme, through which enormous, hard, thick-walled cells\r\nare scattered in great numbers and are visible to the naked eye, as\r\nthey form large irregular groups of a bright yellow colour. Towards the\r\ninner part these stone-cells disappear, the tissue being traversed by\r\nundulated medullary rays, loaded with very small starch grains; many of\r\nthe other parenchymatous cells of the liber contain crystals of calcium\r\noxalate. The longitudinal section of the liber exhibits large but not\r\nvery numerous laticiferous vessels, containing a brownish mass, the\r\nconcrete milk juice in which all parts of the tree abound.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The first attempts to isolate the active\r\nprinciples of this bark were made by two apothecaries, Scharlée at\r\nBatavia[1561] (1862) and Gruppe at Manila[1562] (1872).\r\n\r\nIn 1875 Jobst and Hesse exhausted the powdered bark with petroleum\r\nether, and then extracted, by boiling alcohol, the salt of an alkaloid,\r\nwhich they called _Ditamine_. After the evaporation of the alcohol, it\r\nis precipitated by carbonate of sodium and dissolved by ether, from\r\nwhich it is removed by shaking it with acetic acid. Ditamine as again\r\nisolated from the acetate forms an amorphous and somewhat crystalline,\r\nbitterish powder of decidedly alkaline character; the barks yields\r\nabout 0·02 per cent. of it.\r\n\r\nFrom the substances extracted by means of petroleum ether, as above\r\nstated, Jobst and Hesse further isolated (1) _Echicaoutchin_, C₂₅H₄₀O₂,\r\nan amorphous yellowish mass; (2) _Echicerin_, C₃₀H₄₈O₂, forming\r\nacicular crystals, melting at 157° C.; (3) _Echitin_, C₃₂H₅₂O₂,\r\ncrystallized scales, melting at 170°; (4) _Echiteïn_, C₄₂H₇₀O₂, which\r\nforms rhombic prisms, melting at 195°; (5) _Echiretin_, C₃₅H₅₆O₂, an\r\namorphous substance melting at 52° C.\r\n\r\nEchicaoutchin may be written thus: (C₅H₈)₅O₂, echicerin (C₅H₈)₆O₂,\r\nechiretin (C₅H₈)₇O₂; these formulæ at once point out how nearly the\r\nthree last named substances are allied. They are probably constituents\r\nof the milky juice of the tree.\r\n\r\nLastly, Jobst and Hesse pointed out the existence of another alkaloid\r\nin Dita bark.\r\n\r\nHarnack (1877) on the other hand is of the opinion that it contains\r\nonly one alkaloid, which he terms _Ditaïne_. He used the alcoholic\r\nextract of the bark which he treated with ether to which he added a\r\nlittle ammonia. By this process ditamine of Jobst and Hesse would\r\nhave been removed, but Harnack suggests that only a little ditaïne is\r\ndissolved by ether. He then mixed the extract with potash and exhausted\r\nit with alcohol, which afforded crystals of ditaïne, answering to the\r\nformula C₂₂H₃₀N₂O₄; its physiological action is nearly the same as\r\nthat of curare. Ditaïne is but sparingly soluble in ether or petroleum\r\nether, but dissolves readily in water, alcohol, or chloroform; it has a\r\ndecidedly alkaline reaction. It would appear that it is a glucoside.\r\n\r\n[1561] Geneesk, _Tijdschr. Nederl. Indië_, x.

Brown (_Periploca indica_\r\nWilld., _Asclepias Pseudo-sarsa_ Roxb.), a twining shrub, growing\r\nthroughout the Indian Peninsula and in Ceylon. The leaves are very\r\ndiverse, being narrow and lanceolate in the lower part of the plant,\r\nand broadly ovate in the upper branches.[1564]\r\n\r\n=History=—In the ancient Sanskrit literature the plant occurs\r\nfrequently under the name _Sārivā_, and its root under the name of\r\n_Nannārī_ or _Ananta-mūl_ (_i.e._ endless root) has long been employed\r\nin medicine in the southern parts of India.[1565] Ashburner in 1831\r\nwas the first to call the attention of the profession in Europe to\r\nits medicinal value.[1566] In 1864 it was admitted to a place in the\r\n_British Pharmacopœia_, but its efficiency is by no means generally\r\nacknowledged.\r\n\r\n=Description=[1567]—The root is in pieces of 6 inches or more in\r\nlength; it is cylindrical, tortuous, longitudinally furrowed, from\r\n²/₁₀ to ⁷/₁₀ of an inch in thickness, mostly simple or provided with\r\na few thin rootlets emitting slender, branching woody aerial stems,\r\n³/₀ of an inch or less thick. Externally it is dark brown, sometimes\r\nwith a slight violet-grey hue, which is particularly obvious in the\r\nsunshine. The transverse section of the hard root shows a white mealy\r\nor brownish or somewhat violet cortical layer, not exceeding ⅒ of an\r\ninch in thickness, and a yellowish woody column, separated by a narrow\r\ndark undulated cambial line. Neither the wood nor the cortical tissue\r\npresent a radiate structure in the stout pieces; in the thinner roots,\r\nmedullary rays are obvious in the woody part. The extremely thin corky\r\nlayer easily separates from the bark, which latter is frequently marked\r\ntransversely by large cracks. The root, whether fresh or dried, has\r\nan agreeable odour resembling tonka bean or melilot. The dried root\r\nhas a sweetish taste with a very slight acidity. The stems are almost\r\ntasteless and inodorous. The root found in the English market is often\r\nof very bad quality.\r\n\r\n[1563] _Yearbook of Pharm._ 1878. 624, from _Proc. of the American\r\nPharm. Association_, 1877.\r\n\r\n[1564] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med. Plants_, part 6 (1876).\r\n\r\n[1565] There is an Indian root figured as _Palo de Culebra_ by Acosta\r\n(_Tractado de las Drogas ... de las Indias Orientales_, 1578, cap.\r\nlv.) which is astonishingly like the drug in question. He describes\r\nit moreover as having a sweet smell of melilot. The plant he says is\r\ncalled in Canarese _Duda sali_. The figure is reproduced in Antoine\r\nColin’s translation, but not in that of Clusius.\r\n\r\n[1566] _Lond. Med. and Phys. Journ._ lxv. 189.\r\n\r\n[1567] Taken from excellent specimens obligingly sent to us from India\r\nby Dr. L. W. Stewart and Mr. Broughton.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—All the proper cortical tissue shows a uniform\r\nparenchyme, not distinctly separated into liber, medullary rays and\r\nmesophlœum. On making a longitudinal section however, one can observe\r\nsome elongated laticiferous vessels filled with the colourless concrete\r\nmilky juice. In a transverse section, they are seen to be irregularly\r\nscattered through the bark, chiefly in its inner layers, yet even\r\nhere in not very considerable number. They are frequently 30 mkm. in\r\ndiameter and not branched.\r\n\r\nThe wood is traversed by small medullary rays, which are obvious only\r\nin the longitudinal section. The parenchymatous tissue of the root is\r\nloaded with large, ovoid starch granules. Tannic matters do not occur\r\nto any considerable amount, except in the outermost suberous layer.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The root has not been submitted to any adequate\r\nchemical examination. Its taste and smell appear not to depend on the\r\npresence of essential oil, so far as may be inferred from microscopic\r\nexamination; and it is probable the aroma is due to a body of the\r\ncumarin class. According to Scott,[1568] the root yields by simple\r\ndistillation with water a stearoptene, which is probably the substance\r\nobtained by Garden in 1837, and supposed to be a volatile acid.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The drug is reputed to be alterative, tonic, diuretic and\r\ndiaphoretic, but is rarely employed, at least in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTEX MUDAR.\r\n\r\n_Cortex Calotropidis_; _Mudar_; F. _Ecorce de racine de Mudar_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—The drug under notice is furnished by two\r\nnearly allied species of _Calotropis_, occupying somewhat distinct\r\ngeographical areas, but not distinguished from each other in the native\r\nlanguages of India. These plants are:—\r\n\r\n1. _Calotropis procera_ R. Brown (_C. Hamiltonii_ Wight), a large\r\nshrub, 6 or more feet high, with dark green, oval leaves, downy\r\nbeneath, abounding in acrid milky juice.\r\n\r\nIt is a native of the drier parts of India, as the Deccan, the Upper\r\nProvinces of Bengal, the Punjab and Sind, but is quite unknown in the\r\nsouthern provinces; it also extends to Persia, Palestine, the Sinaitic\r\nPeninsula, Arabia, Egypt, to the oasis Dachel, and other oases of the\r\nSahara, to Nubia, Abyssinia, the lake Tsad and through the Sudan.\r\nLastly it has been naturalized in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n2. _C. gigantea_ R. Brown (_Asclepias gigantea_ Willd.), a large erect\r\nshrub, 6 to 10 feet high, with stem as thick as a man’s leg,[1569] much\r\nresembling preceding, indigenous to Lower Bengal and the southern parts\r\nof India, Ceylon, the Malayan Peninsula, and the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nBoth species are extremely common in waste ground over their respective\r\nareas.[1570]\r\n\r\n[1568] _Pharm. of India_, 457; also _Chem. Gazette_, 1843. 378.\r\n\r\n[1569] Hence the specific name _gigantea_.\r\n\r\n[1570] The botanical distinctions between the two species may be stated\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\n_C. procera_, corolla cup-shaped, petals somewhat erect, flower-buds\r\nspherical, appendages of corona with a blunt upward point. See Fig. in\r\nBentley and Trimen, _Med. Plants_, part 25 (1877).\r\n\r\n_C. gigantea_, corolla opening flat, flower-buds bluntly conical or\r\noblong, appendages of corona rounded.\r\n\r\n=History=—The ancient name of the plant, which occurs already in the\r\nVedic literature, was _Arka_ (wedge), alluding to the form of the\r\nleaves which were used in sacrificial rites. From one of the Sanskrit\r\nnames of this plant, namely _Mandāra_, Mudar is a corruption;[1571] the\r\nlatter is frequently mentioned in the writings of Susruta.\r\n\r\nThe plant was likewise well known to the Arabian physicians.[1572]\r\n\r\n_C. procera_ was observed in Egypt by Prosper Alpinus (1580-84), and\r\nupon his return to Italy was figured, and some account given of its\r\nmedicinal properties.[1573] It is also the “Apocynum syriacum” figured\r\nby Clusius.[1574]\r\n\r\n_C. gigantea_ was figured by Rheede[1575] in 1679, and in our own day\r\nby Wight.[1576]\r\n\r\nThe medicinal virtues of mudar, though so long esteemed by the natives\r\nof India, were not investigated experimentally by Europeans until the\r\npresent century, when Playfair recommended the drug in elephantiasis,\r\nand its good effects were afterwards noticed by Vos (1826), Cumin\r\n(1827), and Duncan (1829). The last named physician also performed\r\na chemical examination of the root-bark, the activity of which he\r\nreferred to an extractive matter which he termed _Mudarine_.[1577]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The root-bark of _C. procera_, as we have received\r\nit,[1578] consists of short, arched, bent, or nearly flat fragments, ⅛\r\nto ⅕ of an inch thick. They have outwardly a thickish, yellowish-grey,\r\nspongy cork, more or less fissured lengthwise, frequently separating\r\nfrom the middle cortical layer; the latter consists of a white mealy\r\ntissue, traversed by narrow brown liber-rays. The bark is brittle and\r\neasily powdered; it has a mucilaginous, bitter, acrid taste, but no\r\ndistinctive odour. The light yellow, fibrous wood is still attached to\r\nmany of the pieces.\r\n\r\nThe roots of _C. gigantea_ are clothed with a bark which seems to be\r\nundistinguishable from that of _C. procera_ just described. The wood\r\nof the root consists of a porous, pale yellow tissue, exhibiting large\r\nvascular bundles, and very numerous small medullary rays, consisting of\r\n1 to 3 rows of the usual cells.[1579]\r\n\r\n[1571] Information for which we are indebted to Dr. Rice.\r\n\r\n[1572] Ibn Baytar, translated by Sontheimer, ii.

(1829) 60.\r\n\r\n[1578] We are indebted for an authentic specimen to Dr. E. Burton Brown\r\nof Lahore.\r\n\r\n[1579] Roots of _C. gigantea_ kindly supplied to us by Dr. Bidie of\r\nMadras consist of light, woody truncheons, ½ to 2¼ inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—In the root-bark of _C. procera_, the suberous\r\ncoat is made up of large, thin-walled, polyhedral, or almost cubic\r\ncells; the middle cortical layer, of a uniform parenchyme, loaded with\r\nlarge starch granules, or here and there containing some thick-walled\r\ncells (sclerenchyme) and tufts of oxalate of calcium. The large\r\nmedullary rays are built up of the usual cells, having porous walls and\r\ncontaining starch and oxalate. In a longitudinal section, the tissue,\r\nchiefly of the middle cortical layer, is found to be traversed by\r\nnumerous laticiferous vessels, containing the dry milk juice[1580] as a\r\nbrownish granular substance not soluble in potash.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic characters of the root-bark of _C. gigantea_ agree with\r\nthose here detailed of _C. procera_. The stems of _Calotropis_ are\r\ndistinguished by strong liber-fibres, which are not met with in the\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—By following the process of Duncan above\r\nalluded to, 200 grammes of the powdered bark of _C. gigantea_ yielded\r\nus nothing like his _Mudarine_, but 2·4 grammes of an acrid _resin_,\r\nsoluble in ether as well as in alcohol. The latter solution reddens\r\nlitmus; the former on evaporation yields the resin as an almost\r\ncolourless mass. If the aqueous liquid is separated from the crude\r\nresin, and much absolute alcohol added, an abundant precipitate of\r\nmucilage is obtained. The liquid now contains a bitter principle, which\r\nafter due concentration may be separated by means of tannic acid.\r\n\r\nWe obtained similar results by exhausting the bark of _C. procera_\r\nwith dilute alcohol. The tannic compound of the bitter principle was\r\nmixed with carbonate of lead, dried and boiled with spirit of wine.\r\nThis after evaporation furnished an amorphous, very bitter mass, not\r\nsoluble in water, but readily so in absolute alcohol. The solution\r\nis _not_ precipitated by an alcoholic solution of acetate of lead.\r\nBy purifying the bitter principle with chloroform or ether, it is at\r\nlast obtained colourless. This bitter matter is probably the active\r\nprinciple of _Calotropis_; we ascertained by means of the usual tests\r\nthat no alkaloid occurs in the drug. The large juicy stem, especially\r\nthat of _C. gigantea_, ought to be submitted to an accurate chemical\r\nand therapeutical examination.[1581]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Mudar is an alterative, tonic and diaphoretic,—in large doses\r\nemetic. By the natives of India, who employ it in venereal and skin\r\ncomplaints, almost all parts of the plant are used. According to\r\nMoodeen Sheriff,[1582] the bark of the root and the dried milky juice\r\nare the most efficient; the latter is however somewhat irregular and\r\nunsafe in its action. The same writer remarks that he has found that\r\nthe older the plant, the more active is the bark in its effects. He\r\nrecommends that the corky outer coat, which is tasteless and inert,\r\nshould be scraped off before the bark is powdered for use: of a powder\r\nso prepared, 40 to 50 grains suffice as an emetic.\r\n\r\nThe stems of _C. gigantea_ afford a very valuable fibre which can be\r\nspun into the finest thread for sewing or weaving.[1583]\r\n\r\n[1580] It is evidently with a view to the retention of this juice, that\r\nthe _Pharmacopœia of India_ orders the bark to be stripped from the\r\nroots when the latter are half-dried. Moodeen Sheriff remarks of _C.\r\ngigantea_, that although it is frequently used in medicine, no part\r\nof it is sold in the bazaars,—no doubt from the circumstance that the\r\nplant is everywhere found wild and can be collected as required.\r\n\r\n[1581] List’s _Asclepione_ (Gmelin’s _Chemistry_, xvii. 368) might then\r\nbe sought for.\r\n\r\n[1582] _Supplement to the Pharmacopœia of India_, Madras, 1869. 364;\r\nfor further information on the therapeutic uses of mudar, see also\r\n_Pharm. of India_, 458.\r\n\r\n[1583] Drury, _Useful Plants of India_, 2nd ed. 1873. 101.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLIA TYLOPHORÆ.\r\n\r\n_Country or Indian Ipecacuanha_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Tylophora asthmatica_ Wight et Arnott (_Asclepias\r\nasthmatica_ Roxb.), a twining perennial plant, common in sandy soils\r\nthroughout the Indian Peninsula and naturalized in Mauritius. It may be\r\ndistinguished from some of its congeners by its reddish or dull pink\r\nflowers, with the scale of the staminal corona abruptly contracted into\r\na long sharp tooth.[1584]\r\n\r\n=History=—The employment of this plant in medicine is well known to\r\nthe Hindus, who call it _Antamul_ and use it with considerable success\r\nin dysentery, but we have not succeeded in tracing it in the ancient\r\nIndian literature. During the last century it attracted the attention\r\nof Roxburgh[1585] who made many observations on the administration of\r\nthe root, while physician to the General Hospital of Madras from 1776\r\nto 1778. It was also used very successfully in the place of ipecacuanha\r\nby Anderson, Physician-General to the Madras army.[1586] In more recent\r\ntimes, the plant has been prescribed by O’Shaughnessy, who pronounced\r\nthe root an excellent substitute for ipecacuanha if given in rather\r\nlarger doses.[1587] Kirkpatrick[1588] administered the drug in at least\r\na thousand cases, and found it of the greatest value; he prescribed\r\nthe _dried leaf_, not only because superior to the root in certainty\r\nof action, but also as being obtainable without destruction of the\r\nplant. The drug has been largely given by many other practitioners in\r\nIndia. _Tylophora_ is also employed in Mauritius, where it is known\r\nas _Ipéca sauvage_ or _Ipéca du pays_. It has a place in the _Bengal\r\nPharmacopœia_ of 1844, and in the _Pharmacopœia of India_ of 1868.\r\n\r\n=Description=[1589]—The leaves are opposite, entire, from 2 to 5 inches\r\nlong, ¾ to 2½ inches broad, somewhat variable in outline, ovate or\r\nsubrotund, usually cordate at the base, abruptly acuminate or almost\r\nmucronate, rather leathery, glabrous above, more or less downy beneath\r\nwith soft simple hairs. The pedicel, which is channelled, is ½ to ¾ of\r\nan inch in length. In the dry state the leaves are rather thick and\r\nharsh, of a pale yellowish green; they have a not unpleasant herbaceous\r\nsmell, with but very little taste.[1590]\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—A concentrated infusion of the leaves has a\r\nslightly acrid taste. It is abundantly precipitated by tannic acid, by\r\nneutral acetate of lead or caustic potash, and is turned greenish-black\r\nby perchloride of iron. Broughton of Ootacamund (India) has informed\r\nus (1872) that from a large quantity of the leaves he obtained a small\r\namount of crystals,—insufficient for analysis. Dissolved and injected\r\ninto a small dog, they occasioned purging and vomiting.\r\n\r\n[1584] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med. Plants_, part 29 (1878).\r\n\r\n[1585] _Flora Indica_, ed. Carey, ii.

(1850) tab.\r\n1277.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Employed in India, as already mentioned, as a substitute for\r\nipecacuanha, chiefly in the treatment of dysentery. The dose of the\r\npowdered leaves as an _emetic_ is 25 to 30 grains, as a diaphoretic and\r\nexpectorant 3 to 5 grains.\r\n\r\n_Radix Tylophoræ_—This root is met with in the Indian bazaars, and\r\nhas been employed, as before stated, as much or more than the leaf.\r\nIt consists of a short, knotty, descending rootstock, about ⅛ of an\r\ninch in thickness, emitting 2 to 3 aerial stems, and a considerable\r\nnumber of wiry roots. These roots are often 6 inches or more in length\r\nby ½ a line in diameter, and are very brittle. The whole drug is of a\r\npale yellowish-brown; it has no considerable odour, but a sweetish and\r\nsubsequently acrid taste. In general appearance it is suggestive of\r\nvalerian, but is somewhat stouter and larger.\r\n\r\nExamined microscopically, the parenchymatous envelope of the rootlets\r\nis seen to consist of two layers, the inner forming a small nucleus\r\nsheath. The outer portion is built up of large cells, loaded with\r\nstarch granules and tufted crystals of oxalate of calcium. Salts of\r\niron do not alter the tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGANIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n=NUX VOMICA.=\r\n\r\n_Semen Nucis Vomicæ_; _Nux Vomica_; F. _Noix vomique_; G. _Brechnuss_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Strychnos Nux vomica_ L., a moderate sized tree\r\nwith short, thick, often crooked stem, and small, greenish-white,\r\ntubular flowers ranged in terminal corymbs. It is indigenous to most\r\nparts of India, especially the coast districts, and is found in Burmah,\r\nSiam, Cochin China and Northern Australia.\r\n\r\nThe ovary of _S. Nux vomica_ is bilocular, but as it advances in growth\r\nthe dissepiment becomes fleshy and disappears. The fruit, which is an\r\nindehiscent berry of the size and shape of a small orange, is filled\r\nwith a bitter, gelatinous white pulp, in which the seeds, 1 to 5 in\r\nnumber, are placed vertically in an irregular manner. The epicarp forms\r\na thin, smooth, somewhat hard shell, which at first is greenish, but\r\nwhen mature, of a rich orange-yellow. The pulp of the fruit contains\r\nstrychnine,[1591] yet it is said to be eaten in India by birds.[1592]\r\nThe wood, which is hard and durable, is very bitter.\r\n\r\n[1591] Roxburgh’s assertion that the pulp “_seems perfectly innocent_,”\r\ninduced us to examine it chemically, which we were enabled to do\r\nthrough the kindness of Dr. Thwaites, of the Royal Botanical Gardens,\r\nCeylon. The _inspissated pulp_ received from Dr. T., diluted with\r\nwater, formed a very consistent jelly having a slightly acid reaction\r\nand very bitter taste. Some of it was mixed with slaked lime,\r\ndried, and then exhausted by boiling chloroform. The liquid left on\r\nevaporation a yellowish resinoid mass, which was warmed with acetic\r\nacid. The colourless solution yielded a perfectly white, crystalline\r\nresidue, which was dissolved in water, and precipitated with bichromate\r\nof potassium. The crystallized precipitate dried, and moistened with\r\nstrong sulphuric acid, exhibited the violet hue characteristic of\r\nstrychnine.\r\n\r\nTo confirm this experiment, we obtained through the obliging assistance\r\nof Dr. Bidie of Madras, some of the white pulp taken with a spoon from\r\nthe interior of the ripe fruit, and at once immersed _per se_ in spirit\r\nof wine. The alcoholic fluid gave abundant evidence of the presence of\r\nstrychnine.\r\n\r\n[1592] According to Cleghorn by the hornbill (_Buceros malabaricus_);\r\naccording to Roxburgh by “many sorts of bird.” Beddome (_Flora\r\nSylvatica_, Madras, 1872. 243) says the pulp is quite harmless, and the\r\nfavourite food of many birds.\r\n\r\nIn Garnier, _Exploration en Indo-China_ ii. (Paris, 1873) 488, allusion\r\nis made to a tree similar to that under notice having fruits which are\r\ndevoid of poison _before maturity_.\r\n\r\n=History=—Nux Vomica, which was unknown to the ancients, is thought to\r\nhave been introduced into medicine by the Arabians. But the notices in\r\ntheir writings which have been supposed to refer to it, are far from\r\nclear and satisfactory. We have no evidence moreover that it was used\r\nin India at an early period. Garcia de Orta, an observer thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the drugs of the west coast of India in the middle of\r\nthe 16th century, is entirely silent as to nux vomica. Fleming,[1593]\r\nwriting at the beginning of the present century, remarks that nux\r\nvomica is seldom, if ever, employed in medicine by the Hindus, but this\r\nstatement does not hold good now.\r\n\r\nThe drug was however certainly made known in Germany in the 16th\r\ncentury. Valerius Cordus[1594] wrote a description of it about the year\r\n1540, which is remarkable for its accuracy. Fuchs, Bauhin and others\r\nnoticed it as _Nux Metella_, a name taken from the _Methel_ of Avicenna\r\nand other Arabian authors.[1595]\r\n\r\nIt was found in the English shops in the time of Parkinson (1640), who\r\nremarks that its chief use is for poisoning dogs, cats, crows, and\r\nravens, and that it is rarely given as a medicine.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Nux Vomica is the _seed_, removed from the pulp and\r\nshell. It is disc-like, or rather irregularly orbicular, a little less\r\nthan an inch in diameter, by about a quarter of an inch in thickness,\r\nslightly concave on the dorsal, convex on the ventral surface, or\r\nnearly flat on either side, often furnished with a broad, thickened\r\nmargin so that the central portion of the seed appears depressed.\r\nThe outside edge is rounded or tapers into a keel-like ridge. Each\r\nseed has on its edge a small protuberance, from which is a faintly\r\nprojecting line (raphe) passing to a central scar, which is the hilum\r\nor umbilicus; a slight depression marks the opposite side of the seed.\r\nThe seeds are of a light greyish hue, occasionally greenish, and have a\r\nsatiny or glistening aspect, by reason of their being thickly covered\r\nwith adpressed, radiating hairs. Nux vomica is extremely compact and\r\nhorny, and has a very bitter taste.\r\n\r\nAfter having been softened by digestion in water, the seed is easily\r\ncut along its outer edge, then displaying a mass of translucent,\r\ncartilaginous albumen, divided into two parts by a fissure in which\r\nlies the embryo. This latter is about ³/₁₀ of an inch long, having\r\na pair of delicate 5-to 7-nerved, heart-shaped cotyledons, with a\r\nclub-shaped radicle, the position of which is indicated on the exterior\r\nof the seed by the small protuberance already named.\r\n\r\n[1593] _Catalogue of Indian Med.

Gesner, Argentorat. 1561. lib.\r\niv. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[1595] Clusius and others held the opinion that the _Nux methel_ of\r\nthe Arabs was the fruit of a _Datura_, and an Indian species was\r\naccordingly named by Linnæus _D. Metel_.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The hairs of nux vomica are of remarkable\r\nstructure. They are formed as usual of the elongated cells of the\r\nepidermis, and have their walls thickened by secondary deposits, which\r\nare interrupted by longitudinally extended pores; they are a striking\r\nobject in polarized light. The albumen is made up of large cells,\r\nloaded with albuminoid matters and oily drops, but devoid of starch.\r\nIn water the thick walls of this parenchyme swell up and yield some\r\nmucilage; the cotyledons are built up of a narrow, much more delicate\r\ntissue, traversed by small fibro-vascular bundles.\r\n\r\nThe alkaloids are not directly recognizable by the microscope; but if\r\nvery thin slices of nux vomica are kept for some length of time in\r\nglycerin, they develop feathery crystals, doubtless consisting of these\r\nbases.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The bitter taste and highly poisonous action\r\nof nux vomica are chiefly due to the presence of _Strychnine_ and\r\n_Brucine_. Strychnine, C₂₁H₂₂N₂O₂, was first met with in 1818 by\r\nPelletier and Caventou in St. Ignatius’ Beans, and immediately\r\nafterwards in nux vomica. It crystallizes from an alcoholic solution\r\nin large anhydrous prisms of the orthorhombic system. It requires\r\nfor solution about 6700 parts of cold or 2500 of boiling water; the\r\nsolution is of decidedly alkaline reaction, and an intensely bitter\r\ntaste which may be distinctly perceived though it contain no more than\r\n¹/₆₀₀₀₀₀ of the alkaloid. The best solvents for strychnine are spirit\r\nof wine or chloroform; it is but very sparingly soluble in absolute\r\nalcohol, benzol, amylic alcohol, or ether. The alcoholic solution\r\ndeviates the ray of polarized light to the left.\r\n\r\nStrychnine is not restricted to the fruit of the plant under notice,\r\nbut also occurs in the wood and bark.[1596] It is moreover found in\r\nthe wood of the root of _Strychnos colubrina_ L., and in the bark of\r\nthe root of _Strychnos Tieute_ Lesch., both species indigenous to the\r\nIndian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of _Brucine_ was made in 1819 by the same chemists, in\r\nnux vomica bark, then supposed to be derived from _Brucea ferruginea_\r\nHéritier (_B. antidysenterica_ Miller), an Abyssinian shrub of the\r\norder Simarubeæ. The presence of brucine in nux vomica and St.\r\nIgnatius’ Bean was pointed out by them in 1824. Brucine, dried over\r\nsulphuric acid, has the formula C₂₃H₂₆N₂O₄, but it crystallizes\r\nfrom its alcoholic solution with 4 OH₂. In bitterness and poisonous\r\nproperties, as well as in rotatory power, it closely resembles\r\nstrychnine, differing however in the following particulars:—it is\r\nsoluble in about 150 parts of boiling water, melts without alteration a\r\nlittle above 130° C. In common with its salts, it acquires a dark red\r\ncolour when moistened with concentrated nitric acid.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of strychnine in nux vomica appears to vary from ¼ to ½\r\nper cent. That of brucine is variously stated to be 0·12 (Merck), 0·5\r\n(Wittstein), 1·01 (Mayer) per cent.\r\n\r\nA third crystallizable base, called _Igasurine_, was stated in 1853 by\r\nDesnoix to occur in the liquors from which strychnine and brucine had\r\nbeen precipitated by lime. Schützenberger’s investigations (1858) are\r\nfar from proving the existence of “igasurine.”[1597]\r\n\r\n[1596] It is remarkable that parasitic plants of the order\r\n_Loranthaceæ_ growing on _Strychnos Nux vomica_ acquire the poisonous\r\nproperties of the latter.—_Pharm. of India_, 1868. 108.\r\n\r\n[1597] For further information on igasurine, consult Gmelin,\r\n_Chemistry_, xvii. (1866) 589; Watts, _Dictionary of Chemistry_, iii.\r\n(1865) 243; _Pharm. Journ._ xviii. (1859) 432.\r\n\r\nIn nux vomica, as well as in St. Ignatius’ Beans, the alkaloids,\r\naccording to their discoverers, are combined with _Strychnic_ or\r\n_Igasuric Acid_; Ludwig (1873), who prepared this body from the latter\r\ndrug, describes it as a yellowish-brown amorphous mass, having a\r\nstrongly acid reaction and a sour astringent taste, and striking a\r\ndark green with ferric salts. We have ascertained the correctness of\r\nLudwig’s observations.\r\n\r\nNux vomica dried at 100° C. yielded us when burnt with soda-lime 1·822\r\nper cent. of nitrogen, indicating about 11·3 per cent. of protein\r\nsubstances. By boiling ether, we removed from the seeds 4·14 per cent.\r\nof fat; Meyer[1598] found it to yield butyric, capronic, caprylic,\r\ncaprinic and other acids of the series of the common fatty acids, and\r\nalso one acid richer in carbon than stearic acid. Nux vomica also\r\ncontains mucilage and sugar. The latter, which according to Rebling\r\n(1855) exists to the extent of 6 per cent., reduces cupric oxide\r\nwithout the aid of heat. When macerated in water, the seeds easily\r\nundergo lactic fermentation, not however attended with decomposition of\r\nthe alkaloids. The stability of strychnine is remarkable, even after\r\nten years of contact with putrescent animal substances.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Large quantities of nux vomica are brought into the London\r\nmarket from British India.[1599] The export from Bombay in the year\r\n1871-72 was 3341 cwt., all shipped to the United Kingdom.[1600] Madras\r\nin 1869-70 exported 4805 cwt.; and Calcutta in 1865-66, 2801 cwt. The\r\nquantity imported into the United Kingdom in 1870[1601] was 5534 cwt.\r\n\r\nNux vomica is stated by Garnier (_l.c._ page 429, note) to be largely\r\nexported from Cambodja to China.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Tincture and extract of nux vomica, and the alkaloid strychnine,\r\nare frequently administered as tonic remedies in a variety of disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEN IGNATII.\r\n\r\n_Faba Sancti Ignatii_; _St. Ignatius’ Beans_; F. _Fèves de Saint\r\nIgnace_, _Noix Igasur_; G. _Ignatiusbohnen_.[1602]\r\n\r\n[1598] _Jahresbericht der Chemie_, 1875. 856.\r\n\r\n[1599] We have seen 1136 packages offered in a single drug sale (30\r\nMarch 1871).\r\n\r\n[1600] _Statement of the Trade and Navigation of Bombay for 1871-72_,\r\npt. ii. 62.\r\n\r\n[1601] No later returns are accessible.\r\n\r\n[1602] The plant and seeds are known in the Bisaya language by the\r\nnames of _pangaguason_, _aguason_, _canlara_, _mananaog_, _dancagay_,\r\n_catalonga_ or _igasur_; in the islands of Bohol and Çebu, where the\r\nseeds are produced, by that of _coyacoy_, and by the Spaniards of the\r\nPhilippines as _Pepita de Bisaya_ or _Pepita de Catbalogan_ (Clain,\r\n_Remedios Faciles_, Manila, 1857. p. 610). The name _St. Ignatius’\r\nBean_ applied to them in Europe, is employed in South America to\r\ndesignate the seeds of several medicinal _Cucurbitaceæ_, as those of\r\n_Fenillea trilobata_ L., _Hypanthera Guapeva_ Manso and _Anisosperma\r\nPassiflora_ Manso.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Strychnos Ignatii_ Bergius[1603] (_S. philippensis_\r\nBlanco, _Ignatiana philippinica_ Loureiro), a large climbing shrub,\r\ngrowing in Bohol, Samar, and Çebu, islands of the Bisaya group of the\r\nPhilippines, and according to Loureiro in Cochin China, where it has\r\nbeen introduced. The inflorescence and foliage are known to botanists\r\nonly from the descriptions given by Loureiro[1604] and Blanco.[1605]\r\nThe fruit is spherical, or sometimes ovoid, 4½ inches in diameter by\r\n6¾ long, as shown by Ray and Petiver’s figure. It has a smooth brittle\r\nshell enclosing seeds to the number of about 24. G. Bennett,[1606] who\r\nsaw the fruits at Manila sold in the bazaar, says they contain from 1\r\nto 12 seeds, imbedded in a glutinous blackish pulp.[1607] According to\r\nJagor[1608] the shrub is abundant near Basey, in the south-western part\r\nof the island of Samar, on the straits of San Juanico; its seeds are\r\nmet with as a medicine in many houses in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n=History=—It is stated by Murray[1609] and later writers that this seed\r\nwas introduced into Europe from the Philippines by the Jesuits, who,\r\non account of its virtues, bestowed upon it the name of Ignatius, the\r\nfounder of their order. However this may be, the earliest account of\r\nthe drug appears to be that communicated by Camelli, Jesuit missionary\r\nat Manila, to Ray and Petiver, and by them laid before the Royal\r\nSociety of London in 1699.[1610] Camelli proclaimed the seed to be the\r\n_Nux Vomica legitima_ of the Arabian physician Serapion, who flourished\r\nin the 9th century; but in our opinion there is no warrant whatever\r\nfor supposing it to have been known at so remote a period.[1611]\r\n_Sancti Ignatii_, is much esteemed as a remedy in various disorders,\r\nthough he was well aware of its poisonous properties when too freely\r\nadministered. In Germany, St. Ignatius’ Bean was made known about the\r\nsame period by Bohn of Leipzig.[1612]\r\n\r\nThe drug is found in the Indian bazaars under a name which is evidently\r\ncorrupted from the Spanish _pepita_. It is met with in the drugshops of\r\nChina as _Leu-sung-kwo_, i.e. _Luzon fruit_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—St. Ignatius’ Beans are about an inch in length; their\r\nform is ovoid, yet by mutual pressure it is rendered very irregular,\r\nand they are 3-, 4-, or 5-sided, bluntly angular, or flattish, with a\r\nconspicuous hilum at one end. In the fresh state, they are covered with\r\nsilvery adpressed hairs: portions of a shaggy brown epidermis are here\r\nand there perceptible on those found in commerce, but in the majority\r\nthe seed shows the dull grey, granular surface of the albumen itself.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the different outward appearance, the structure of St.\r\nIgnatius’ Beans accords with that of nux vomica. The radicle however\r\nis longer, thicker, and frequently somewhat bent, and the cotyledons\r\nare more pointed. The horny brownish albumen is translucent, very hard,\r\nand difficult to split. The whole seed swells considerably by prolonged\r\ndigestion in warm water, and has then a heavy, earthy smell. The beans\r\nare intensely bitter and highly poisonous.\r\n\r\n[1603] _Materia Medica_, Stockholm, 1778. i. 146.—We omit citing the\r\nLinnean _Ignatia amara_, as it has been shown by Bentham that the plant\r\nso named by the younger Linnæus is _Posoqueria longiflora_ Aubl. of the\r\norder _Rubiaceæ_, a native of Guiana.\r\n\r\n[1604] _Flora Cochinchinensis_, ed.

They were discovered by Magellan in 1521, but their conquest by\r\nthe Spaniards was not effectually commenced until 1565. Previous to\r\nthe Spanish occupation, they were governed by petty chiefs, and were\r\nfrequented for the purposes of commerce by Japanese, Chinese, and\r\nMalays.\r\n\r\n[1612] Martiny, _Encyklopädie der Rohwaarenkunde_, i. (1843) 576.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The hairs of the epidermis are of an analogous\r\nstructure, but more simple than in nux vomica. The albumen and\r\ncotyledons agree in structural features with those of the same parts in\r\nnux vomica.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Strychnine exists to the extent of about 1·5\r\nper cent.; the seeds also contain 0·5 per cent. of brucine. Dried over\r\nsulphuric acid and burnt with soda-lime, it yielded us an average of\r\n1·78 per cent. of nitrogen, which would answer to about 10 per cent. of\r\nalbuminoid matter.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—We have no information as to the collection of the drug. The\r\nseeds are met with irregularly in English trade, being sometimes very\r\nabundant, at others scarcely obtainable.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The same as those of nux vomica. When procurable at a moderate\r\nprice, the seeds are valued for the manufacture of strychnine.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX SPIGELIÆ.\r\n\r\n_Radix Spigeliæ Marilandicæ_; _Indian Pink Root_, _Carolina Pink Root_,\r\n_Spigelia_.[1613]\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Spigelia marilandica_ L., an herbaceous plant\r\nabout a foot high, indigenous in the woods of North America, from\r\nPennsylvania to Wisconsin and southward. According to Wood and Bache,\r\nit is collected chiefly in the Western and South-western States.\r\n\r\n[1613] _Pink Root_ is sometimes erroneously latinized in price-lists,\r\n“_Radix caryophylli_.”\r\n\r\n=History=—The anthelminthic properties of the root, discovered by\r\nthe Indians, were brought to notice in Europe about the year 1754\r\nby Linning, Garden, and Chalmers, physicians of Charleston, South\r\nCarolina. The drug was admitted to the London Pharmacopœia in 1788.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Pink root has a near resemblance to serpentary,\r\nconsisting of a short, knotty, dark brown rhizome emitting slender\r\nwiry roots. It is quite wanting in the peculiar odour of the latter\r\ndrug, or indeed in any aroma; in taste it is slightly bitter and\r\nacrid. Sometimes the entire plant with its quadrangular stems a foot\r\nhigh is imported. It has opposite leaves about 3 inches long, sessile,\r\novate-lanceolate, acuminate, smooth or pubescent.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The transverse section of the rhizome, about\r\n²/₁₀ of an inch in diameter, shows a small woody zone enclosing a large\r\npith of elliptic outline, consisting of thin-walled cells. Usually the\r\ncentral tissue is decayed. In the roots, the middle cortical layer\r\npredominates; it swells in water, after which its large cells display\r\nfine spiral markings. The nucleus-sheath observable in serpentary is\r\nwanting in spigelia.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Not satisfactorily known: the vessels of the\r\nwood contain resin, the parenchyme starch; in the cortical part of the\r\nrhizome some tannic matters occur, but not in the roots. Feneulle\r\n(1823) asserts that the drug yields a little essential oil. The\r\nexperiments of Bureau[1614] show that spigelia acts on rabbits and\r\nother animals as a narcotico-acrid poison.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Spigelia has long been reputed a most efficient medicine for the\r\nexpulsion of _Ascaris lumbricoides_, but according to Stillé,[1615]\r\nits real value for this purpose has probably been over-estimated. This\r\nauthor speaks of it as possessing alterative and tonic properties. In\r\nEngland, it is rarely prescribed by the regular practitioner, but is\r\nused as a household medicine in some districts. It is much employed in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTIANEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX GENTIANÆ.\r\n\r\n_Gentian Root_; F. _Racine de Gentiane_; G. _Enzianwurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Gentiana lutea_ L., a handsome perennial herb,\r\ngrowing 3 feet high, indigenous to open grassy places on the mountains\r\nof Middle and Southern Europe. It occurs in Portugal, Spain, the\r\nPyrenees, in the islands of Sardinia and Corsica, in the Apennines,\r\nthe mountains of Auvergne, the Jura, the Vosges, the Black Forest, and\r\nthroughout the chain of the Alps as far as Bosnia and the Danubian\r\nPrincipalities. Among the mountains of Germany, it is found on the\r\nSuabian Alps near Würzburg, and here and there in Thuringia, but not\r\nfurther north, nor does it occur in the British Islands.\r\n\r\n=History=—The name _Gentiana_ is said to be derived from Gentius, a\r\nking of the Illyrians, living B.C. 180-167, by whom, according to both\r\nPliny and Dioscorides, the plant was noticed. Whether the species thus\r\nnamed was _Gentiana lutea_ is doubtful. During the middle ages, gentian\r\nwas commonly employed for the cure of disease, and as an antidote to\r\npoison. Tragus in 1552 mentions it as a means of diluting wounds, an\r\napplication which has been resorted to in modern medical practice.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The plant has a cylindrical, fleshy, simple root, of pale\r\ncolour, occasionally almost as much as 4 feet in length by 1½ inches in\r\nthickness, producing 1 to 4 aerial stems.\r\n\r\nThe dried root of commerce is in irregular, contorted pieces, several\r\ninches in length, and ½ to 1 inch in thickness; the pieces are much\r\nwrinkled longitudinally, and marked transversely, especially in their\r\nupper portion, with numerous rings. Very often they are split to\r\nfacilitate drying. They are of a yellowish-brown; internally of a\r\nmore orange tint, spongy, with a peculiar, disagreeable, heavy odour,\r\nand intensely bitter taste. The crown of the root, which is somewhat\r\nthickened, is clothed with the scaly bases of leaves. The root is tough\r\nand flexible,—brittle only immediately after drying. We found it to\r\nlose in weight about 18 per cent.; by complete drying in a water-bath\r\nit regained 16 per cent. by being afterwards exposed to the air.\r\n\r\n[1614] _De la famille des Loganiacées_, 1856. 130.\r\n\r\n[1615] _Therapeutics and Materia Medica_, Philadelphia, ii. (1868) 651.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—A transverse section shows the bark separated\r\nby a dark cambial zone from the central column; the radial arrangement\r\nof the tissues is only obvious in the latter part. In the bark,\r\nliber-fibres are wanting; and in the centre there is no distinct\r\npith. The fibro-vascular bundles are devoid of thick-walled ligneous\r\nprosenchyme; this may explain the consistence, and the short even\r\nfracture of the root. It is moreover remarkable on account of the\r\nabsence both of starch and oxalate of calcium; the cells appear to\r\ncontain chiefly sugar and a little fat oil.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The bitter taste of gentian is due to a\r\nsubstance called _Gentiopicrin_ or _Gentian-bitter_, C₂₀H₃₀O₁₂.\r\nSeveral chemists, as Henry, Caventou, Trommsdorff, Leconte and Dulk\r\nhave described the bitter principle of gentian in an impure state,\r\nunder the name of _Gentianin_, but Kromayer in 1862 first obtained it\r\nin a state of purity. Gentiopicrin is a neutral body crystallizing in\r\ncolourless needles, which readily dissolve in water. It is soluble\r\nin spirit of wine, but in absolute alcohol only when aided by heat;\r\nit does not dissolve in ether. A solution of caustic potash or soda\r\nforms with it a yellow solution. Under the influence of a dilute\r\nmineral acid, gentiopicrin is resolved into glucose, and an amorphous,\r\nyellowish-brown, neutral substance, named _Gentiogenin_. Fresh gentian\r\nroots yield somewhat more than ⅒ per cent. of gentiopicrin; from the\r\ndried root it could not be obtained in a crystallized state. The\r\nmedicinal Tincture of Gentian, mixed with solution of caustic potash,\r\nloses its bitterness in a few days, probably in consequence of the\r\ndestruction of the gentiopicrin.\r\n\r\nAnother constituent of gentian root is _Gentianin_ or _gentisin_\r\n\r\n                                  {CH₃\r\n    C₁₄H₁₀O₅ or (OH)₂C₆H₃·CO·C₆H₂  {O \\.\r\n                                  {O /\r\n\r\nIt forms tasteless yellowish prisms, sparingly soluble in alcohol,\r\nrequiring about 5000 parts of water for solution. With alkalis it\r\nyields intensely yellow crystallizable compounds, which, however,\r\nare easily decomposed already by carbonic acid. Gentianin may be\r\nsublimed if carefully heated at 250° C. By melting it with caustic\r\npotash, acetic acid, phloroglucin, C₆H₃(OH)₃, and oxysalicylic acid,\r\nC₆H₃(OH)₂COOH, are produced, as shown in 1875 by Hlasiwetz and\r\nHabermann. The name of _gentianic acid_ or _gentisinic acid_ had been\r\napplied to the oxysalicylic acid obtained by the above decomposition\r\nbefore it was identified with oxysalicylic acid from other sources.\r\n\r\nGentian root abounds in pectin; it also contains, to the extent of 12\r\nto 15 per cent., an uncrystallizable sugar, of which advantage is taken\r\nin Southern Bavaria and Switzerland for the manufacture by fermentation\r\nand distillation of a potable spirit.[1616] This use of gentian and its\r\nconsumption in medicine have led to the plant being almost extirpated\r\nin some parts of Switzerland where it formerly abounded.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Maisch (1876) and Ville (1877) have shown tannic\r\nmatters to be absent from the root.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Gentian root finds its way into English commerce through\r\nthe German houses; and some is shipped from Marseilles. The quantity\r\nimported into the United Kingdom in 1870 was 1100 cwt.\r\n\r\n[1616] Th. Martius, _Pharm. Journ._ xii. (1853) 371.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Gentian is much used in medicine as a bitter tonic. Ground to\r\npowder, the root is an ingredient in some of the compositions sold for\r\nfeeding cattle.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—It can hardly be said that gentian is adulterated, yet\r\nthe roots of several other species possessing similar properties are\r\noccasionally collected; of these we may name the following:—\r\n\r\n1. _Gentiana purpurea_ L.—This species is found in Alpine meadows\r\nof the Apennines, Savoy and Switzerland, in Transylvania, and in\r\nSouth-western Norway; a variety also in Kamtchatka.[1617] The root is\r\nfrequently collected;[1618] it attains at most 18 inches in length and\r\na diameter of about 1 inch at the summit, from which arise 8 to 10\r\naerial stems, clothed below with many scaly remains of leaves. The top\r\nof the root has thus a peculiar branched appearance, never found in\r\nthe root of _G. lutea_, with which in all other respects that of _G.\r\npurpurea_ agrees. The latter is perhaps even more intensely bitter.\r\n\r\n2. _G. punctata_ L.—Nearly the same description applies to this\r\nspecies, which is a native of the Alps of South-Eastern France, Savoy,\r\nthe southern parts of Switzerland, extending eastward to Austria,\r\nHungary and Roumelia.\r\n\r\n3. _G. pannonica_ Scop.—a plant of the mountains of Austria, unknown\r\nin the Swiss Alps, has a root which does not attain the length or the\r\nthickness of the root of _G. purpurea_, with which it agrees in other\r\nrespects. It is officinal in the Austrian Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n4. _G. Catesbœi_ Walter (_G. Saponaria_ L.)—indigenous in the United\r\nStates. Its root, usually not exceeding 3 inches in length by ⅓ inch in\r\ndiameter, has a very thin woody column within a spongy whitish cortical\r\ntissue and a bright yellow epidermis. This root is less bitter than the\r\nabove enumerated drugs; the same remark applies also to those European\r\nGentianæ which like _G. Catesbœi_ are provided with blue flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBA CHIRATÆ.\r\n\r\n_Herba Chirettæ vel Chiraytæ_; _Chiretta or Chirayta_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Ophelia[1619] Chirata_ Grisebach (_Gentiana\r\nChirayita_ Roxb.), an annual herb of the mountainous regions of\r\nNorthern India from Simla through Kumaon to the Murung district in\r\nSouth-eastern Nepal.\r\n\r\n=History=—Chiretta has long been held in high esteem by the Hindus, and\r\nis frequently mentioned in the writings of Susruta. It is called in\r\nSanscrit _Kirāta-tikta_, which means the _bitter plant of the Kirātus_,\r\nthe Kirātas being an outcast race of mountaineers in the north of\r\nIndia. In England, it began to attract some attention about the year\r\n1829; and in 1839 was introduced into the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia. The\r\nplant was first described by Roxburgh in 1814.\r\n\r\n[1617] Grisebach (_Die Vegetation der Erde_, i. 1872. 223) gives very\r\ninteresting particulars relating to the area of growth of _Gentiana\r\npurpurea_, _G. punctata_ and _G. pannonica_. He is decidedly of the\r\nopinion that they are distinct species.\r\n\r\n[1618] In Norway it is, strange to say, called sweetroot, “_Sötrot_,”\r\naccording to Schübeler, _Pflanzenwelt Norwegens_, 1873-1875, p. 259.\r\n\r\n[1619] Ὀϕέλλειν, to bless, in allusion to the medical virtues of the\r\nherb.—Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med. Plants_, part 7 (1876).\r\n\r\nChiretta was regarded by Guibourt as the _Calamus aromaticus_ of the\r\nancients, but the improbability of this being correct was well pointed\r\nout by Fée[1620] and by Royle, and is now generally admitted.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The entire plant is collected when in flower, or more\r\ncommonly when the capsules are fully formed, and tied up with a slip\r\nof bamboo into flattish bundles of about 3 feet long,[1621] each\r\nweighing when dry from 1½ to 2 lb. The stem, ²/₁₀ to ³/₁₀ of an inch\r\nin thickness, is of an orange-brown, sometimes of a dark purplish\r\ncolour; the tapering simple root, often much exceeding the stem in\r\nthickness, is 2 to 4 inches long and up to ½ an inch thick. It is\r\nless frequently branched, but always provided with some rootlets.\r\nIn stronger specimens, the root is somewhat oblique or geniculate;\r\nperhaps the stem is in this case the product of a second year’s growth\r\nand the plant not strictly annual. Each plant usually consists of a\r\nsingle stem, yet occasionally two or more spring from a single root.\r\nThe stem rises to a height of 2 to 3 feet, and is _cylindrical in its\r\nlower and middle portion_, but bluntly quadrangular in its upper,\r\nthe four edges being each marked with a prominent decurrent line,\r\nas in _Erythræa Centaurium_ and many other plants of the order. The\r\ndecussate ramification resembles that of other gentians; its stems\r\nare jointed at intervals of 1½ to 3 or 4 inches, bearing opposite\r\nsemi-amplexicaul leaves on their cicatrices. The stem consists in its\r\nlower portion of a large woody column, coated with a very thin rind,\r\nand enclosing a comparatively large pith. The upper parts of the stem\r\nand branches contain a broad ring of thick-walled woody parenchyme. The\r\nnumerous slender axillary and opposite branches are elongated, and thus\r\nconstitute a dense umbellate panicle. They are smooth and glabrous, of\r\na greenish or brownish grey colour.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are ovate-acuminate, cordate at the base, entire, sessile,\r\nthe largest 1 inch or more in length, 3-to 5-or 7-nerved, the midrib\r\nbeing strongest. At each division of the panicle there are two small\r\nbracts. The yellow corolla is rotate, 4-lobed, with glandular pits\r\nabove the base; the calyx is one-third the length of the petals, which\r\nare about half an inch long. The one-celled, bivalved capsule contains\r\nnumerous seeds.\r\n\r\nThe flowers share the intense bitterness of the whole drug. The wood of\r\nstronger stems is devoid of the bitter principles.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—A chemical examination of chiretta has been made\r\nat our request under the direction of Professor Ludwig of Jena, by his\r\nassistant Mr. Höhn. The chief results of this careful and elaborate\r\ninvestigation may be thus described.[1622]\r\n\r\nAmong the bitter principles of the drug, _Ophelic Acid_, C₁₃H₂₀O₁₀,\r\noccurs in the largest proportion. It is an amorphous, viscid, yellow\r\nsubstance, of an acidulous, persistently bitter taste, and a faint\r\ngentian-like odour. With basic acetate of lead, it produces an abundant\r\nyellow precipitate. Ophelic acid does not form an insoluble compound\r\nwith tannin; it dissolves in water, alcohol and ether. The first\r\nsolution causes the separation of protoxide of copper from an alkaline\r\ntartrate of that metal.\r\n\r\n[1620] _Cours d’Histoire nat. pharmaceutique_, ii. (1828) 395.\r\n\r\n[1621] The other kinda of chiretta to be named presently are usually\r\nmuch shorter.\r\n\r\n[1622] For full details, see _Archiv der Pharmacie_, 189 (1869) 229.\r\n\r\nA second bitter principle, _Chiratin_, C₂₆H₄₈O₁₅, may be removed by\r\nmeans of tannic acid, with which it forms an insoluble compound.\r\nChiratin is a neutral, not distinctly crystalline, light yellow,\r\nhygroscopic powder, soluble in alcohol, ether and in warm water. By\r\nboiling hydrochloric acid, it is decomposed into _Chiratogenin_,\r\nC₁₃H₂₄O₃, and ophelic acid. Chiratogenin is a brownish, amorphous\r\nsubstance, soluble in alcohol but not in water, nor yielding a tannic\r\ncompound. No sugar is formed in this decomposition.\r\n\r\nThese results exhibit no analogy to those obtained in the analysis\r\nof the European gentians. Finally, Höhn remarked in chiretta a\r\ncrystallizable, tasteless, yellow substance, but its quantity was so\r\nminute that no investigation of it could be made.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of chiretta, dried at 100° C., afforded 7·5 per cent. of\r\nash; the stems 3·7; salts of potassium and calcium prevailing in both.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Chiretta is a pure bitter tonic, devoid of aroma and\r\nastringency. In intense bitterness it exceeds gentian, _Erythræa_ and\r\nother European plants of the same order. It is much valued in India,\r\nbut is not very extensively used in England, and not at all on the\r\nContinent. It is said to be employed when cheap, in place of gentian,\r\nto impart flavour to the compositions now sold as _Cattle Foods_.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes and Adulteration=—Some other species of _Ophelia_, namely,\r\n_O. angustifolia_ Don, _O. densifolia_ Griseb., _O. elegans_ Wight,\r\n_O. pulchella_ Don, and _O. multiflora_ Dalz, two or three species of\r\n_Exacum_, besides _Andrographis paniculata_ Wall., are more or less\r\nknown in the Indian bazaars by the name of _Chiretta_[1623] and possess\r\nto a greater or less degree the bitter tonic properties of that drug.\r\nAnother _Gentianacea_, _Slevogtia orientalis_ Griseb., is called _Chota\r\nChiretta_, i.e. _small chiretta_. It would exceed due limits were we\r\nto describe each of these plants: we have therefore given a somewhat\r\ndetailed description of the true chiretta, which will suffice for its\r\nidentification. We have frequently examined the chiretta found in the\r\nEnglish market, but have never met with any other than the legitimate\r\nsort.[1624] Bentley noticed in 1874 the substitution of _Ophelia\r\nangustifolia_, which he found to be by far less bitter than true\r\nchiretta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVOLVULACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCAMMONIUM.\r\n\r\n_Scammony_; F. _Scammonée_; G. _Scammonium_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Convolvulus Scammonia_ L., a twining plant much\r\nresembling the common _C. arvensis_ of Europe, but differing from it\r\nin being of larger size, and having a stout tap-root. It occurs in\r\nwaste bushy places in Syria, Asia Minor, Greece, the Greek Islands,\r\nextending northward to the Crimea and Southern Russia, but appears to\r\nbe wanting in Northern Africa, Italy, and in all the western parts of\r\nthe Mediterranean basin.\r\n\r\n[1623] Moodeen Sheriff, _Suppl. to the Pharmacopœia of India_, 1869.\r\npp. 138. 189.—Consult also _Pharmacopœia of India_, 1868. pp. 148-9.\r\n\r\n[1624] Mr. E. A. Webb has pointed out a case of false-packing in which\r\nthe roots of _Rubia cordifolia_ L. (_Munjit_) had been enclosed in the\r\nbundles of chiretta.\r\n\r\n=History=—The dried milky juice of the scammony plant has been known\r\nas a medicine from very ancient times. Theophrastus in the 3rd century\r\nB.C. was acquainted with it; it was likewise familiar to Dioscorides,\r\nPliny, Celsus, and Rufus of Ephesus, each of whom has given some\r\naccount of the manner in which it was collected. Scammony used then\r\nalso to be called _Diagrydion_, from the Greek word δάκρυ, tear. The\r\nmediæval Arabian physicians also knew scammony and the plant from\r\nwhich it is derived. The drug was used in Britain in the 10th and 11th\r\ncenturies, and would appear to be one of the medicines recommended\r\nto King Alfred the Great, by Helias, patriarch of Jerusalem.[1625]\r\nIt is repeatedly named in the medical writings in use prior to the\r\nNorman conquest (A.D. 1066), in one of which directions are given for\r\nrecognizing the goodness of the drug by the white emulsion it produces\r\nwhen wetted.\r\n\r\nThe botanists of the 16th and 17th centuries, as Brunfels, Gesner,\r\nMatthiolus, Dodonæus, and the Bauhins, described and figured the plant\r\npartly under the name of _Scammonia syriaca_. The collecting of the\r\ndrug was well described by Russell, an English physician of Aleppo\r\n(1752), whose account[1626] is accompanied by an excellent figure\r\nrepresenting the plant and the means of obtaining its juice.\r\n\r\n[1625] Such is the opinion expressed by the Rev. O. Cockayne. The\r\nletter of Helias to Alfred is imperfect, and mentions only balsam,\r\npetroleum, theriaka, and a white stone used as a charm. But from\r\nthe reference to these four articles in another part of the MS., in\r\nconnection with scammony, ammoniacum, tragacanth, and galbanum, there\r\nis ground for believing that the latter (Syrian and Persian) drugs were\r\nincluded in the lost part of the patriarch’s letter.—See _Leechdoms,\r\nWortcunning and Starcraft of Early England_, edited by Cockayne (Master\r\nof the Rolls Series), vol. ii. pages xxiv. 289. 175, also 273. 281.\r\n\r\n[1626] _Medical Observations and Inquiries_, i. (1757) 12.\r\n\r\nScammony was formerly distinguished by the names _Aleppo_ and _Smyrna_,\r\nthe former sort being twice or thrice as costly as the latter; at the\r\npresent day Aleppo scammony has quite lost its pre-eminence.\r\n\r\n=Localities producing the drug=—Scammony is collected in Asia Minor,\r\nfrom Brussa and Boli in the north, to Macri and Adalia in the south,\r\nand eastward as far as Angora. But the most productive localities\r\nwithin this area are the valley of the Mendereh, south of Smyrna:\r\nand the districts of Kirkagach and Demirjik, north of that town. The\r\nneighbourhood of Aleppo likewise affords the drug. A little is obtained\r\nfurther south in Syria, from the woody hills and valleys about the lake\r\nof Tiberias and Mount Carmel.\r\n\r\n=Production=—The scammony plant has a long woody root, which throws off\r\ndownwards a few lateral branches, and produces from its knotty summit\r\nnumerous twining stems which are persistent and woody at the base. In\r\nplants of three or four years old, the root may be an inch or more in\r\ndiameter; in older specimens it sometimes acquires a diameter of three\r\nor four inches. In length, it is from two to three feet, according to\r\nthe depth of soil in which it grows. When the root is wounded, there\r\nexudes a milky juice which dries up to a golden-brown, transparent,\r\ngummy-looking substance:—this is _pure scammony_.[1627]\r\n\r\nThe method followed in collecting scammony for use appears to be\r\nnearly the same in all localities. It has been thus described to us by\r\ntwo eye-witnesses, both long resident in the East.[1628] Operations\r\ncommence by clearing away the bushes among which the plant is commonly\r\nfound; the soil around the latter is then removed, so as to leave 4\r\nor 5 inches of the root exposed. This is then cut off in a slanting\r\ndirection at 2 to 4 inches below the crown, and a mussel-shell is stuck\r\ninto it just beneath the lowest edge, so as to receive the milky-sap\r\nwhich instantly flows out. The shells are usually left till evening,\r\nwhen they are collected, and the cut part of the root scraped with\r\na knife, so as to remove any partially dried drops of juice. These\r\nlatter are called by the Smyrna peasants, _kaimak_ or cream, the softer\r\ncontents of the shell being called _gala_ or milk.\r\n\r\n[1627] Named probably from Σκάυυα, a _trench_ or _pit_, in allusion to\r\nthe excavation made around the root.\r\n\r\n[1628] The one was the late Mr. S. H. Maltass of Smyrna, whose\r\ninteresting paper may be found in _Pharm. Journ._ xiii. (1854) 264; the\r\nother is Mr. Edward T. Rogers, formerly of Caiffa, now (1874) British\r\nConsul at Cairo.\r\n\r\nSometimes the scammony is allowed to dry in the shell, and such must\r\nbe regarded as representing the drug in its utmost perfection. But\r\nscammony in shells is not brought into commerce, though a little of it\r\nis reserved by the peasants for their own use.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the shells and the scraped off drops are next emptied\r\ninto a covered copper pot or a leathern bag, carried home, made\r\nhomogenous by mixing with a knife, and at once allowed to dry. In this\r\nway a form of scammony is obtained closely approaching that dried in\r\nthe shell. But it is a quality of exceptional goodness. Usually the\r\npeasant does not dry off the juice promptly, but allows his daily\r\ngatherings to accumulate; and when he has collected a pound or two, he\r\nplaces it in the sunshine to soften, and then kneads it, sometimes with\r\nthe addition of a little water, into a plastic mass, which he lastly\r\nallows to dry. By this long exposure to heat, and retention in a liquid\r\nstate, the scammony juice undergoes fermentation, acquires a strong\r\ncheesy odour and dark colour, and when finally dried, exhibits a more\r\nor less porous or bubbly structure, never observable in shell scammony.\r\n\r\nScammony is very extensively adulterated. The adulteration is often\r\nperformed by the peasants, who mix foreign substances into the drug\r\nwhile it is yet soft; and it is also effected by the dealers, some of\r\nwhom purchase it of the peasants in a half-dried state. The substances\r\nused for sophistication are numerous, the commonest and most easily\r\ndetected being, according to our experience, carbonate of lime and\r\nflour. Woodashes, earth (not always calcareous), gum arabic, and\r\ntragacanth are also employed; more rarely, wax, yolk of egg, pounded\r\nscammony roots, rosin, or black-lead.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The pure juice of the root, simply dried by exposure\r\nto the sun and air, is an amorphous, transparent, brittle substance,\r\nof resinous aspect, a yellowish-brown colour, and glossy fracture.\r\nScammony possessing these characters is occasionally met with in\r\nthe form of flattish irregular masses, about ½ to ¾ of an inch in\r\nthickness, very brittle by reason of internal fissures, yet with but\r\nfew air-cavities. In mass, it is of a chesnut-brown, but in small\r\nfragments it is seen to be very pale yellowish-brown and transparent,\r\nwith the freshly fractured surface vitreous and shining. When powdered\r\nit is of a very light buff. Rubbed with the moistened finger it forms\r\na white emulsion. Treated with ether it yields 88 to 90 per cent. of\r\nsoluble matter, and a nearly colourless residuum. This scammony, as\r\nwell as the pure juice in the shell, is very liable to become mouldy;\r\nbut besides this, it throws out, if long kept, a white, mammillated,\r\ncrystalline efflorescence, the nature of which we have not been able to\r\ndetermine. But if scammony is kept quite dry, neither mouldiness nor\r\nefflorescence makes its appearance.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary fine scammony of commerce, known as _Virgin Scammony_, is\r\nalso in large flat pieces or irregular flattened lumps and fragments,\r\nwhich in mass have a dark grey or blackish hue. Viewed in thin\r\nfragments, it is seen to be translucent and of a yellowish-brown. It\r\nis very easily broken, exhibits a shining fracture, gives an ashy-grey\r\npowder, and has a peculiar cheesy odour. Some of the pieces have a\r\nporous, bubbly structure, indicative of fermentation; the more solid\r\noften show the efflorescence already mentioned. Scammony has not much\r\ntaste, but leaves an acrid sensation in the throat.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Scammony owes its active properties as a\r\nmedicine to a resin shown (1860) by Spirgatis to be identical with\r\nthat found in the root of the Mexican _Ipomœa orizabensis_, known in\r\ncommerce as _Male Jalap_: this resin called _Jalapin_ will be described\r\nin the next article. The other constituents of pure scammony are not\r\nwell known. One of them is the substance which, as already stated,\r\nmakes its appearance as small masses of cauliflower crystals on the\r\nsurface of pure scammony, when the latter is kept in air not perfectly\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nWhether the odour observable in commercial scammony is due to a\r\nvolatile fatty acid developed by fermentation, is a question still to\r\nbe investigated.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The export of scammony from Smyrna amounted in 1871 to 278\r\ncases, valued at £8320; in 1872 to 185 cases, value £6100. According\r\nto a report of Consul Skene on the trade of Northern Syria,[1629]\r\n737 cases of scammony were exported from the province of Aleppo in\r\n1872,—six-sevenths of the quantity being for England. In 1873 Aleppo\r\nexported by way of Alexandretta to England 46,500 kilogrammes of\r\nscammony root and 900 kilogrammes of the resin, the latter being valued\r\nat 36,000 francs (£1444).\r\n\r\nAn establishment at Brussa, founded by Della Sudda, of Constantinople,\r\nis stated to export since 1870 a very good scammony resin extracted by\r\nalcohol.[1630]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Employed as an active cathartic, often in combination with\r\ncolocynth and calomel.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Scammony is very often imported in an adulterated\r\nstate, but the adulteration is so clumsily effected, and is so easily\r\ndiscoverable by simple tests, or even by ocular examination, that\r\ndruggists have but little excuse for accepting a bad article.\r\n\r\n[1629] Presented to Parliament, July 1873.\r\n\r\n[1630] Dragendorff’s _Jahresbericht_, 1876. 158.\r\n\r\nWe have already named the substances used in the sophistication of\r\nscammony: of these, the most frequent are carbonate of lime and\r\nfarinaceous matter. The first may generally be recognized by examining\r\nthe fractured surface of the drug with a good lens, when the white\r\nparticles of the carbonate will be perceived. If the surface is then\r\ntouched (while still _sub lente_) with hydrochloric acid, effervescence\r\nwill prove the presence of a carbonate. Other earthly adulterants can\r\nbe discovered by incineration, or by examining the residue of the\r\ndrug after treatment with ether. Starchy substances, the presence of\r\nwhich may be surmised by the scammony being difficult to break, are\r\ndetectable by the microscope or by solution of iodine, a cold decoction\r\nof scammony not being affected by that reagent. Scammony that is\r\nponderous, dull and clayey, not easily broken in the fingers, or which\r\nwhen broken does not exhibit a clean, glossy surface, or which does\r\nnot afford at least 80 per cent. of matter soluble in ether, should be\r\nrejected. That which is made up in the form of hard, dark, circular\r\ncakes is widely different from pure scammony.\r\n\r\nScammony may be distinguished from _Resin of Scammony_ by its property\r\nof forming an emulsion when wetted. The resin is also more glossy and\r\nalmost entirely soluble in ether.\r\n\r\nRadix Scammoniæ.\r\n\r\nThe frauds commonly practised on the scammony of commerce have given\r\nrise to various schemes for obtaining the drug in a purer form, as well\r\nas at a more moderate price.[1631]\r\n\r\nSo far back as 1839, the Edinburgh College prescribed a _Resina\r\nScammonii_, which was prepared by exhausting scammony with a spirit of\r\nwine, distilling off the spirit, and washing the residue with water.\r\nSuch an extract was manufactured by the late Mr. Maltass of Smyrna, and\r\noccasionally shipped to London.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a suggestion made by Mr. Clark, manufacturer of\r\nliquorice at Sochia near Scala Nuova, south of Smyrna, a patent was\r\ntaken out (1856) by Prof. A. W. Williamson of London, for preparing\r\nthis resin directly from the dried root by means of alcohol. The same\r\nchemist shortly afterwards devised an improved process, which consists\r\nin boiling the roots first with water and then with dilute acid, so\r\nas to deprive them of all matters soluble in those menstrua, and\r\nafterwards extracting the resin by alcohol.\r\n\r\nResin of Scammony, obtained either from scammony or from the dried\r\nroot, is ordered in the _British Pharmacopœia_ of 1867, and is\r\nmanufactured by a few houses. It is a brown, translucent, brittle\r\nsubstance of resinous fracture, entirely soluble in ether, and not\r\nforming an emulsion when wetted with water.\r\n\r\nScammony root is occasionally brought into the London market, sometimes\r\nin rather large quantity,[1632] but it is not generally kept by\r\ndruggists, nor do we find it quoted in price-currents. Its collection\r\nis even opposed in some parts of Turkey by the local authorities.[1633]\r\n\r\n[1631] Scammony was quoted in a London price current, April 1874, at\r\n8_s._ to 36_s._ per lb., Resin of Scammony at 14_s._ per lb.\r\n\r\n[1632] Thus 100 bales were offered in a drug sale, 3 July 1873.\r\n\r\n[1633] Such was the case at Aleppo, as we know by a private letter from\r\nMr. Consul Skene.—D. H.\r\n\r\nThe root consists of stout, woody, cylindrical pieces, often spirally\r\ntwisted, 2 to 3 inches in diameter, covered with a rough, furrowed,\r\ngreyish-brown bark. They are internally pale brown, tough and resinous,\r\nwith a faint odour and taste resembling jalap. A good sample yielded us\r\n5½ per cent. of resin; Kingzett and Farries (1877) showed the root to\r\nbe devoid of an alkaloid.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX JALAPÆ.\r\n\r\n_Tuber Jalapæ_; _Jalap_, _Vera Cruz Jalap_; F. _Racine de Jalap_; G.\r\n_Jalape_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Ipomœa Purga_ Hayne (_Convolvulus Purga_ Wenderoth,\r\n_Exogonium Purga_ Bentham), a tuberous-rooted plant, throwing out\r\nherbaceous, twining stems, clothed with cordate-acuminate sharply\r\nauricled leaves, and bearing elegant salver-shaped, deep pink flowers.\r\nIt grows naturally on the eastern declivities of the Mexican Andes,\r\nat an elevation above the sea of 5000 to 8000 feet, especially about\r\nChiconquiaco and the adjacent villages, and also around San Salvador\r\non the eastern slope of the Cofre de Perote. In these localities where\r\nrain falls almost daily, and where the diurnal temperature varies\r\nfrom 15° to 24° C. (60° to 75° F.), the plant occurs in shady woods,\r\nflourishing in a deep rich vegetable soil.\r\n\r\nThe jalap grows freely in the south of England, if planted in a\r\nsheltered border, but its flowers are produced so late in autumn that\r\nthey rarely expand, and the tubers, which develope in some abundance,\r\nare liable to be destroyed in winter unless protected from frost.\r\n\r\nThe plant has been introduced on the Neilgherry Hills in the south\r\nof India; it succeeds there remarkably well,[1634] and might be\r\nextensively propagated if there were any adequate inducement.\r\n\r\n=History=—The use as a purgative of the tuber of a convolvulaceous\r\nplant of Mexico, was made known by the early Spanish voyagers; and so\r\nhighly was the new drug esteemed that large quantities of it reached\r\nEurope during the 16th century.\r\n\r\nMonardes, writing in 1565, says the new drug was called _Ruybarbo de\r\nlas Indias_ or _Ruybarbo de Mechoacan_, the latter name being given\r\nin allusion to the province of Michoacan whence the supplies were\r\nderived. Some writers have advanced the opinion that mechoacan root was\r\nthe modern jalap, but in this we do not concur, for the description\r\ngiven of mechoacan and the place of its production do not apply well\r\nto jalap. Both drugs were moreover well known about 1610; they were\r\nperfectly distinguished by Colin, an apothecary of Lyons (1619),\r\nwho mentions jalap (“_racine de Ialap_”) as then newly brought to\r\nFrance.[1635] They were however often confounded, or at least only\r\ndistinguished by their difference of tint. Thus jalap, which at that\r\nperiod used to be imported cut into transverse slices,[1636] was\r\ntermed, from its darker colour, _Black Mechoacan_; and on the other\r\nhand, the paler mechoacan was in later times known as _White Jalap_.\r\n\r\n[1634] Thus at Ootacamund, Mr. Broughton, in a letter to one of us (15\r\nJanuary 1870), speaks of receiving “a cluster of tubers” weighing over\r\n9 lb., and remarks that the plant grows as easily as yam.\r\n\r\n[1635] Monardes, _Hist. des Medicamens_, trad. par Colin, ed. 2.\r\n16.—The first edition of this work seems to be unknown.\r\n\r\n[1636] Hill, _History of the Mat. Med._ Lond. 1751. 549.\r\n\r\nMechoacan root is now known to consist (at least in part) of the large\r\nthick tuber of _Ipomœa Jalapa_ Pursh (_Batatas Jalapa_ Choisy), a plant\r\nof the Southern United States and Mexico. As a drug it has been long\r\nobsolete in Europe, having given place to jalap, which is a more active\r\nand efficient purgative.\r\n\r\nThe botanical source of jalap was not definitely ascertained until\r\nabout the year 1829, when Dr. Coxe of Philadelphia published a\r\ndescription and coloured figure, taken from living plants sent to him\r\ntwo years previously from Mexico.[1637]\r\n\r\n=Manner of Growth=—Though we have cultivated the jalap plant for many\r\nyears, we have had no opportunity of examining the seedling, but\r\njudging from analogy suppose that it has at first a small tap-root\r\nwhich gradually thickens after the manner of a radish. A root of\r\njalap, called by some _tuber_ and by others _tubercule_, throws out in\r\naddition to aerial stems, slender, prostrate, underground shoots which\r\nemit roots at intervals. These roots while but an inch or two long\r\nbecome thickened and carrot-shaped, gradually enlarging into napiform\r\ntuber-like bodies, which emit a few rootlets from their surface and\r\ntaper off below in long, slender ramifications. The thickened roots\r\nhave no trace of leaf-organs; the aerial stems grow from the shoot from\r\nwhich they originated.\r\n\r\nFresh jalap roots (tubers) are externally rough and dark brown,\r\ninternally white and fleshy.\r\n\r\n=Collection=—Jalap is said to be dug up in Mexico during the whole\r\nyear.[1638] The smaller roots are dried entire; the larger are cut\r\ntransversely, or are gashed so that they may dry more easily. As drying\r\nby sun-heat would be almost impracticable owing to the wetness of the\r\nclimate, the roots are placed in a net, and suspended over the almost\r\nconstantly burning hearth of the Indian’s hut, where they gradually\r\ndry, and at the same time often contract a smoky smell. Much of the\r\njalap that has of late arrived has been more freely sliced than usual,\r\nand has obviously been dried with less difficulty.\r\n\r\nAccording to Schiede, whose account was written in 1829,[1639] the\r\nIndians of Chiconquiaco were at that period commencing the cultivation\r\nof jalap in their gardens.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The jalap of commerce consists of irregular, ovoid\r\nroots, varying from the size of an egg to that of a hazel-nut, but\r\noccasionally as large as a man’s fist. They are usually pointed at the\r\nlower end, deeply wrinkled, contorted and furrowed, and of a dark brown\r\nhue, dotted over with numerous little, elongated, lighter coloured\r\nscars, running transversely. The large roots are incised lengthwise, or\r\ncut into halves or quarters, but the smaller are usually entire. Some\r\nof the small roots are spindle-shaped or cylindrical; others can be\r\nfound which are nearly globular, smooth and pitchy-looking, but these\r\nlatter are seldom solid. Good jalap is ponderous, tough, hard and often\r\nhorny, becoming brittle when long kept, and breaking with a resinous\r\nnon-fibrous fracture; internally it is of a pale dingy brown or dirty\r\nwhite. It has a faint smoky, rather coffee-like odour, and a mawkish\r\ntaste, followed by acridity.\r\n\r\n[1637] _American Journal of Med. Sciences_, v. (1829) 300. pl. 1-2.\r\n\r\n[1638] It is plain that such a proceeding is irrational. The roots\r\nshould be dug up when the aerial stems have died down.\r\n\r\n[1639] _Linnæa_, iii. (1830) 473; _Pharm. Journ._ viii. (1867) 652.—We\r\nare not aware of any more recent account.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—Seen in transverse section, jalap exhibits no\r\nradiate structure, but numerous small concentric rings, which in many\r\npieces are very regularly arranged. They are due to the laticiferous\r\ncells, differing from the surrounding parenchyme only by their contents\r\nand rather large size. These laticiferous cells traverse the tissue in\r\na vertical direction, constituting vertical bands, as may be observed\r\non a longitudinal section; the single cells are simply placed one\r\non the other, and do not form elongated ducts as in _Lactuca_ or\r\n_Taraxacum_.\r\n\r\nThe fibro-vascular bundles of jalap are neither numerous nor large;\r\nthey are accompanied by thin-walled cells, so that firm woody rays do\r\nnot occur. Parenchymatous cells are abundant, and, on a longitudinal\r\nfracture especially, if subsequently moistened, are seen to constitute\r\nconcentric layers. The laticiferous cells are always found in the outer\r\npart of each layer. The suberous coat with which the drug is covered is\r\nmade up of the usual tabular cells.\r\n\r\nThe parenchyme of jalap is loaded with starch grains; in the pieces\r\nwhich have been submitted to heat in order to dry them, the starch\r\nappears as an amorphous mass, and the drug then exhibits a horny\r\nconsistence and greyish fracture, instead of being mealy. Crystals of\r\ncalcium oxalate are frequently met with. The laticiferous cells contain\r\nthe resin of jalap in a semi-fluid state, even in the dry drug; drops\r\nof the resinous emulsion flow out of the cells, if thin slices are\r\nmoistened by any watery liquid.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Jalap owes its medicinal efficacy to a resin,\r\nwhich is extractable by exhausting the drug with spirit of wine,\r\nconcentrating the alcoholic solution to a small bulk, and pouring\r\nit into water. The resin precipitated in this manner is then washed\r\nand dried; it is contained in jalap to the extent of 12 to 18 per\r\ncent.[1640]\r\n\r\nFrom this crude resin, which is the _Resina jalapæ_ of the\r\npharmacopœias, ether or chloroform extracts 5 to 7 (12, Umney) per\r\ncent. of a resin which, according to Kayser,[1641] partially solidifies\r\nwhen in contact with water in crystalline needles. We can by no means\r\nconfirm Kayser’s statement. The residue (insoluble in ether) is one\r\nof the substances to which the name _Jalapin_ has been applied.[1642]\r\nW. Mayer, 1852-1855, who designated it _Convolvulin_,[1643] found it\r\nto have the composition C₃₁H₅₀O₁₆. When purified, it is colourless;\r\nit dissolves easily in ammonia as well as in the fixed alkalis, and\r\nis not re-precipitated by acids, having been converted by assumption\r\nof water into amorphous Convolvulic Acid, which is readily soluble in\r\nwater. Both convolvulin and _convolvulic acid_ are resolved by moderate\r\nheating with dilute acids, or with emulsin, into crystallizable\r\n_Convolvulinol_, C₂₆H₅₀O₇, and sugar. Convolvulinol in contact with\r\naqueous alkalis is converted into _Convolvulinolic Acid_, C₂₆H₄₈O₆,\r\nwhich is slightly soluble in water and crystallizable.\r\n\r\n[1640] Guibourt obtained of it 17 per cent., Umney 21·5, Squibb 11 to\r\n16, T. and H. Smith “not more than 15,” D. Hanbury 11 to 15·8. Jalap\r\ngrown in Bonn afforded to Marquart 12 per cent.; a root cultivated at\r\nMünich gave Widnmann 22 per cent.; from plants produced in Dublin W. G.\r\nSmith got 9 to 12 per cent.; and fine tubers from Ootacamund in India\r\nyielded to one of us 18 per cent. of resin. Broughton is of opinion\r\nthat exposure of the sliced tuber to the air in the process of drying,\r\nfavours the formation of resin, by the oxidation of a hydrocarbon.\r\n\r\n[1641] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, xvi. (1864) 159.\r\n\r\n[1642] As by Pereira, _Elem. of Mat. Med._ ii. (1850) 1463.\r\n\r\n[1643] Gmelin, _op. cit._ xvi. 154.\r\n\r\nWhen convolvulin or its derivatives is treated with nitric acid, it\r\nyields several acids, one of which is the _Sebacic Acid_,\r\n\r\n    C₈H₁₆ {COOH\r\n          {COOH\r\n\r\nwhich is to be obtained by treating castor oil or other fatty\r\nsubstances in the same manner. Sebacic acid forms crystalline scales,\r\nsoluble in boiling water, melting at 128°. That from jalap was first\r\nthought to be a peculiar acid, and therefore termed _ipomic_ or\r\n_ipomœic acid_. Its identification is due to Neison and Bayne (1874).\r\n\r\nConvolvulin (dry) melts at 150° C., but a small amount of water renders\r\nit fusible below 100° C. It is insoluble in oil of turpentine and in\r\nammonia. It dissolves in dilute nitric acid without becoming coloured\r\nor evolving gas. Convolvulin possesses in a high degree the purgative\r\nproperty of jalap, but this is not the case with convolvulinol.\r\n\r\nThe other constituents of jalap include starch, uncrystallizable sugar,\r\ngum, and colouring matter. The sugar, according to Guibourt, exists to\r\nthe extent of 19 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—We have no means of knowing to what extent jalap is produced\r\nin Mexico. The imports of the drug into the United Kingdom amounted in\r\n1870 to 169,951 lb. Very considerable quantities have of late (1873)\r\nappeared in the London drug-sales.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Jalap is employed as a brisk cathartic.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther kinds of Jalap.\r\n\r\nBesides true jalap, the roots of certain other _Convolvulaceæ_ of\r\nMexico have been employed in Europe, either in the form of jalapin, or\r\nas adulterants of the more costly, legitimate drug. The two following\r\nhave been extensively imported and have been traced to their botanical\r\nsource; but there are others, of more occasional occurrence, the origin\r\nof which has not been ascertained.[1644]\r\n\r\n1. _Light_, _Fusiform_, or _Woody Jalap_, _Male Jalap_, _Orizaba Root_,\r\n_Jalap Tops_ or _Stalks_, _Purgo macho_ of the Mexicans.\r\n\r\nThis drug is derived from _Ipomœa orizabensis_ Ledanois,[1645] a\r\nplant of Orizaba, which is but imperfectly known. It is described as\r\na pubescent climber, having a spindle-shaped root about two feet long\r\nof woody and fibrous texture. The drug occurs in irregular rectangular\r\nor block-like pieces, evidently portions of a very large root,\r\ndivided transversely and longitudinally. Sometimes it is more like\r\ntrue jalap, being in entire roots, of smaller size, spindle-shaped,\r\nnot spherical. It has a somewhat lighter colour than jalap, and much\r\ndeeper longitudinal wrinkles. The larger pieces often exhibit deep\r\ncuts from an axe or knife; transverse slices are of rare occurrence.\r\nAlthough generally less ponderous than jalap, the Orizaba drug is\r\nnevertheless of a compact and often horny texture. From jalap it is\r\neasily distinguished by its radiated transverse section, and the\r\nnumerous thick bundles of vessels which project as woody fibres from\r\nthe fractured surface.\r\n\r\n[1644] For information about some of these, consult Guibourt, _Histoire\r\ndes Drogues_, ii. (1869) 523.\r\n\r\n[1645] _Journ. de Chimie méd._ x. (1834) 1-22. pl. 1. 2. (with\r\nunsatisfactory figures).\r\n\r\nIn chemical constitution Orizaba root is closely parallel to jalap.\r\nThe resin was named by Mayer _Jalapin_; it is the _Jalapin_ of\r\nGmelin’s _Chemistry_ (xvi. 405), and perhaps the jalapin of English\r\npharmacy.[1646]\r\n\r\nIn the pure state it is a colourless amorphous translucent resin,\r\n_dissolving perfectly in ether_,[1647] thus differing from convolvulin\r\nthe corresponding resin of jalap. We find that it is readily soluble\r\nalso in acetone, amylic alcohol, benzol and phenol, not in bisulphide\r\nof carbon. It has the composition of C₃₄H₅₆O₁₆, so that it is\r\nhomologous with convolvulin; the decomposition-products of jalapin\r\nobtained by similar treatment, namely jalapic acid, jalapinol, and\r\njalapinolic acid, are likewise homologous with the corresponding\r\nsubstances obtained from convolvulin. All these bodies when treated\r\nwith nitric acid yield ipomœic acid. Jalapin has the same fusing point\r\nas convolvulin, and behaves in the same manner with alkalis.\r\n\r\nThe root afforded us 11·8 per cent. of resin dried at 100° C. When\r\nperfectly washed, decolorized and dissolved in two parts of alcohol,\r\nthis resin turned the plane of polarization of a ray of light 9·8°\r\nto the left, in a column of 50 mm. long. Convolvulin under the same\r\nconditions turned it only 5·8°. The resin of Orizaba root is held by\r\nchemists to be identical with that of scammony, of which it has the\r\ndrastic action.\r\n\r\n2. _Tampico Jalap_,—_Purga de Sierra Gorda_ of the Mexicans. The plant\r\nwhich affords this drug has been described by one of us (1869) under\r\nthe name of _Ipomœa simulans_.[1648] It is closely related to _I.\r\nPurga_ Hayne, from which by its foliage it cannot be distinguished,\r\nbut it has a _bell-shaped corolla_ and _pendulous flower-buds_, which\r\nare very different. _I. simulans_ Hanbury grows in Mexico along the\r\nmountain range of the Sierra Gorda in the neighbourhood of San Luis de\r\nla Paz, from which town and the adjacent villages its roots are carried\r\ndown to Tampico. It has also been found on the lofty Cordillera near\r\nOaxaca, but whether there collected we know not.\r\n\r\nThe drug, to which in trade the name _Tampico Jalap_ is commonly\r\napplied, has been imported during the last few years in considerable\r\nquantities. In appearance it closely approaches true jalap, but the\r\nroots are generally smaller, more elongated or finger-like, more\r\nshrivelled and corky-looking, wanting in the little transverse scars\r\nthat are plentifully scattered over the roots of true jalap. Many\r\npieces occur however which it is impossible to distinguish by the eye\r\nfrom true jalap, with which it agrees also in odour and taste.\r\n\r\nTampico jalap yielded to one of us 10 per cent. of _purified_ resin,\r\nentirely soluble in ether. Umney[1649] obtained 12 to 15 per cent. of\r\nresin almost wholly soluble in ether; Evans got 13 per cent., but found\r\nonly about half of this to be soluble in ether.[1650] According to\r\nAndouard[1651] the resin of Tampico jalap is not deficient in purgative\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n[1646] The name is ill-chosen and misleading, but having been adopted\r\nin standard works, it might occasion greater confusion to attempt to\r\nsupersede it, and its several derivatives.\r\n\r\n[1647] It is at least a fact, that of numerous samples of jalapin that\r\nwe have examined (1871), every one is _completely soluble in ether_.\r\n\r\n[1648] Hanbury, On a species of _Ipomœa_, affording Tampico Jalap,\r\n_Journ. of Linn.

In recent times\r\nthey have been recommended by O’Shaughnessy, Kirkpatrick, Bidie,\r\nWaring[1654] and many other European practitioners in India as a safe\r\nand efficient cathartic.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The shape of the seeds is that which would result if a\r\nnearly spherical body were divided perpendicularly around its axis into\r\n6 or 8 almost equal segments, only that the back is less regularly\r\nvaulted. The seeds are ¼ of an inch high and nearly as much broad; 100\r\nof them weigh on an average about 6 grammes. There is a smaller variety\r\nimported from Calcutta, of which 100 seeds weigh but little over 3\r\ngrammes; in every other respect the two sorts are identical. Both\r\nare of a dull black, excepting at the umbilicus, which is brown and\r\nsomewhat hairy. The adjacent parts of the thin shell (testa) crack in\r\nvarious directions, if the seed is kept for a short time in cold water.\r\nIf it is removed from the upper part of the vaulted back, the radicle\r\nbecomes visible, surrounded by the undulated folds of the cotyledons,\r\nwhich join perpendicularly, but cannot be easily unfolded by reason\r\nof the thin seminal integument. Cut transversely, the cotyledons show\r\nthe same curled structure. Throughout their tissue, small bright\r\nglands in considerable number are observable, even without a lens. The\r\nkernel, which is devoid of albumen, has at first a nutty taste, with\r\nsubsequently a disagreeable persistent acridity. When bruised in a\r\nmortar, the seeds evolve a heavy earthy smell.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The seed is covered with a dark blackish\r\ncuticle, formed of a densely packed tissue, the cells of which show\r\nzigzag outlines. The dark brown epidermis is composed of very close\r\ncylindrical cells, about 70 mkm. in length and 5 to 7 mkm. in diameter;\r\nthey require to be treated with chromic acid in order that their\r\nstructure may be distinctly seen.\r\n\r\nThe tissue of the kernels is made up of thick-walled cells. Between\r\nthis tissue and the shell there is a colourless layer, about 70 mkm.\r\nthick, of thin-walled corky parenchyme. The cotyledons contain in\r\ntheir narrow tissue numerous granules of albuminous matter, mucilage,\r\na little tannic acid, crystals of oxalate of calcium, and a few starch\r\ngranules. The glands or hollows, before alluded to as occurring\r\nthroughout the tissue of the cotyledons, are about 70 mkm. in diameter,\r\nand contain an oily liquid.\r\n\r\n[1652] In Hindustani _Nil_ signifies _blue_, and _Kaladana_, black seed.\r\n\r\n[1653] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen, _Med. Plants_, part 22 (1877).\r\n\r\n[1654] _Pharm. Journ._ vii. (1866) 496.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—By exhausting the seeds dried at 100° C. with\r\nboiling ether, we obtained a thick light brownish oil having an acrid\r\ntaste and concreting below 18° C. The powdered seeds yielded of this\r\noil 14·4 per cent. Water removes from the seeds a considerable amount\r\nof mucilage, some albuminous matter and a little tannic acid. The\r\nfirst is soluble to some extent in dilute spirit of wine, and may be\r\nprecipitated therefrom by an alcoholic solution of acetate of lead.\r\n\r\nThe active principle of kaladana is a _resin_, soluble in alcohol, but\r\nneither in benzol nor in ether. From the residue of the seeds after\r\nexhaustion by ether, treatment with absolute alcohol removed a pale\r\nyellowish resin in quantity equivalent to 8·2 per cent. of the seed.\r\n\r\nKaladana resin, which has been introduced into medical practice in\r\nIndia under the name of _Pharbitisin_,[1655] has a nauseous acrid taste\r\nand an unpleasant odour, especially when heated. It melts about 160° C.\r\nThe following liquids dissolve it more or less freely, namely, spirit\r\nof wine, absolute alcohol, acetic acid, glacial acetic acid, acetone,\r\nacetic ether, methylic and amylic alcohol, and alkaline solutions.\r\nIt is on the other hand insoluble in ether, benzol, chloroform, and\r\nsulphide of carbon. With concentrated sulphuric acid, it forms a\r\nbrownish yellow solution, quickly assuming a violet hue. This reaction\r\nhowever requires a very small quantity of the powdered resin. If a\r\nsolution of the resin in ammonia, after having been kept a short time,\r\nis acidulated, no precipitate is formed; but the solution is now\r\ncapable of separating protoxide of copper from an alkaline solution of\r\nthe tartrate, which originally it did not alter. Heated with nitric\r\nacid, the resin affords _sebacic acid_ (see p. 446).\r\n\r\nFrom these reactions of kaladana resin, we are entitled to infer that\r\nit agrees with the resin of jalap or _Convolvulin_. To prepare it in\r\nquantity, it would probably be best to treat the seeds with common\r\nacetic acid, and to precipitate it by neutralizing the solution. We\r\nhave ascertained that the resin is not decomposed when digested with\r\nglacial acetic acid at 100° C., even for a week.\r\n\r\nWe have had the opportunity of examining a sample of kaladana resin\r\nmanufactured by Messrs. Rogers and Co., chemists of Bombay and Poona,\r\nwhich we found to agree with that prepared by ourselves. It is a light\r\nyellowish friable mass, resembling purified jalap resin, and like\r\nit, capable of being perfectly decolorized by treatment with animal\r\ncharcoal.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Kaladana seeds have cathartic powers like jalap. Besides the\r\nresin, an extract, tincture and compound powder have been introduced\r\ninto the _Pharmacopœia of India_. In many parts of India the natives\r\ntake the roasted seeds as a purgative.\r\n\r\n[1655] _Pharmacopœia of India_, 1868, 156.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLANACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTIPES DULCAMARÆ.\r\n\r\n_Caules Dulcamaræ_; _Bitter-sweet_, _Dulcamara_, _Woody Nightshade_; F.\r\n_Douce-amère_, _Morelle grimpante_; G. _Bittersüss_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Solanum Dulcamara_ L., a perennial shrubby plant,\r\nhaving small purple flowers and red berries, occurring throughout\r\nEurope, except in the extreme north. It is also found in Northern\r\nAfrica, and in Asia Minor, and has become naturalized in North America.\r\nIt is common in moist, shady hedges and thickets.[1656]\r\n\r\n=History=—Bitter nightshade, “manyglog,” was an ingredient, together\r\nwith wild sage and betony, of a drink which the Welsh “Physicians of\r\nMyddfai” in the 13th century prepared for the bite of a mad dog.[1657]\r\nThe stalks of bitter-sweet were also used in the medical practice by\r\nthe German physicians and botanists of the 16th century, one of whom,\r\nTragus (1552), has figured and described it, under the name of _Dulcis\r\namara_ or _Dulcamarum_.\r\n\r\n[1656] _Solanum nigrum_ L. which slightly resembles dulcamara, is a\r\nlow-growing annual or biennial, with _herbaceous_ stems, and berries\r\nusually _black_.\r\n\r\n[1657] _Meddygon Myddvai_ (see Appendix) 185. 293. 375.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The older stems are woody; the upper and younger are\r\nsoft and green, long and straggling, attaining by the support of other\r\nplants a height of 6 feet or more, and dying back in the winter. For\r\nmedicinal use, the shoots of a year or two old should be gathered,\r\neither late in the year, or early in the spring before the leaves\r\ncome out. These shoots are several feet long, by about ⅕ of an inch\r\nthick, of a light greenish-brown, sometimes cylindrical, at others\r\nindistinctly 4-or 5-sided, slightly furrowed longitudinally, or\r\nsomewhat warty.\r\n\r\nThe thin, shining cork-bark easily exfoliates, showing beneath it the\r\nmesophlœum which is rich in chlorophyll. The stalks are mostly hollow,\r\nand partially filled with a whitish pith. The wood when dried is\r\nabout half or one-third as broad as the hollow centre, and the green\r\nbark considerably narrower than the wood; the latter has a radiate\r\nstructure, and in older stems exhibits two or three sharply-defined\r\nannual rings. The stems are usually cut into short lengths before being\r\ndried for use.\r\n\r\nThe odour, which is rather fœtid and unpleasant, is to a great\r\nextent dissipated by drying. The taste, at first slightly bitter, is\r\nafterwards sweetish. The bitter appears to be more predominant in the\r\nspring than in the autumn.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The epidermis of younger shoots consists of\r\ntabular thick-walled cells, many of them being elevated from the\r\nsurface as short blunt hairs. The older stems are covered with the\r\nusual suberous envelope. The boundary between the mesophlœum and the\r\nendophlœum is marked by a ring of strong liber-fibres, some of which\r\nalso occur in the pith. The woody part is rich in large vessels. In the\r\nparenchymatous tissue of bitter-sweet, small crystals of oxalate of\r\ncalcium, not of a well-defined outline, and minute starch granules are\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The taste of bitter-sweet appears due,\r\naccording to Schoonbroodt (1867), to a bitter principle yielding by\r\ndecomposition, sugar and _Solanine_,—the latter in very small amount.\r\nSolanine is an alkaloid; it was first prepared in 1820 by Desfosses, a\r\npharmacien at Besançon, from the berries of _Solanum nigrum_ L., and\r\nwas subsequently detected by the same chemist in the leaves and stalks\r\nof _S. Dulcamara_, and by Peschier in the berries. Winckler (1841)\r\nobserved that the alkaloid of dulcamara stems can be obtained only\r\nin an amorphous state, and that it behaves to platinic and mercuric\r\nchlorides differently from the solanine of potatoes. Moitessier (1856)\r\nconfirmed this observation, and obtained only amorphous salts of the\r\nsolanine of bitter-sweet.\r\n\r\nZwenger and Kind on the one hand, and O. Gmelin on the other (1859\r\nand 1858), found that solanine, C₄₃H₆₉NO₁₆ (or C₄₂H₈₇NO₁₅, according\r\nto Hilger, 1879), is a conjugated compound of sugar and a peculiar\r\ncrystallizable alkaloid, _Solanidine_, C₂₆H₃₉NO (or C₂₆H₄₁NO₂?). The\r\nlatter, under the influence of strong hydrochloric acid, gives up\r\nwater, and is converted into the amorphous and likewise basic compound,\r\n_Solanicine_.\r\n\r\nWittstein (1852) stated another alkaloid, dulcamarine, to be present\r\nin the stems of bitter-sweet. But Geissler (1875) proved that this\r\nsubstance, when perfectly pure, contains no nitrogen, and is not an\r\nalkaloid. Geissler obtained his _Dulcamarin_ by warming an aqueous\r\ndecoction of the drug with charcoal, which he dried and exhausted with\r\nboiling alcohol. This on evaporation afforded a yellowish amorphous\r\nmatter, which was dissolved in water and mixed with a very little\r\nammonia; a substance containing nitrogen then separated. The liquid was\r\nevaporated, the residue again dissolved in alcohol, and the alcohol\r\ndistilled. Dulcamarin thus obtained is a yellowish powder of at first\r\nbitter and subsequently permanently sweet taste. It dissolves in water\r\nor alcohol, not in ether, chloroform, bisulphide of carbon. By boiling\r\ndulcamarin with dilute acids it splits up according to the following\r\nequation:—\r\n\r\n    C₂₂H₃₄O₁₀ + 2 OH₂ = C₆H₁₂O₆ · C₁₆H₂₆O₆.\r\n    Dulcamarin.        Sugar.   Dulcamaretin.\r\n\r\nDulcamaretin, a dark brown, tasteless mass, is soluble in alcohol, not\r\nin water or ether.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Dulcamara is occasionally given in the form of decoction, in\r\nrheumatic or cutaneous affections; but its real action, according to\r\nGarrod, is unknown. This physician remarks[1658] that it does not\r\ndilate the pupil or produce dryness of the throat like belladonna,\r\nhenbane or stramonium. He has given to a patient 3 pints of the\r\ndecoction _per diem_ without any marked action, and has also\r\nadministered as much as half a pound of the fresh berries with no ill\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n[1658] _Essentials of Materia Medica_, 1855. 196.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS CAPSICI.\r\n\r\n    _Pod Pepper_, _Red Pepper_, _Guinea\r\n        Pepper_, _Chillies_, _Capsicum_; F.\r\n        _Piment ou Corail des Jardins_, _Poivre\r\n        d’Inde ou de Guinée_; G. _Spanischer\r\n        Pfeffer_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—The plants, the fruits of which are known as\r\n_Pod Pepper_, have for a long period been cultivated in tropical\r\ncountries, and are now found in such numerous varieties that an exact\r\ndetermination of the original species is a point of great difficulty.\r\nOf several species having pungent fruits, the two following are those\r\nwhich supply the spice found in British commerce:—\r\n\r\n1. _Capsicum fastigiatum_ Blume,[1659] a small ramous shrub, with\r\n4-sided, fastigiate, diverging branches; fruit-bearing peduncles\r\nsub-geminate, slender, erect; fruit very small, subcylindrical, oblong,\r\nstraight, with calyx obconical and truncate. It occurs apparently wild\r\nin Southern India, and is extensively cultivated in Tropical Africa and\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nRoxburgh, who describes this plant under the name _C. minimum_, terms\r\nit _East Indian Bird Chilly_ or _Cayenne Pepper Capsicum_. Wight says\r\nthat it is consumed by the natives of India, but that it is not the\r\nsort preferred. It is this species that the authors of the British\r\nPharmacopœia have cited as the source of the _Fructus Capsici_ to be\r\nused in medicine, and it certainly furnishes the greater part of the\r\nPod Pepper now found in the London market.\r\n\r\n2. _C. annuum_ L., an herbaceous (sometimes shrubby?) plant, with fruit\r\nextremely variable in size, form, and colour, in some varieties erect,\r\nin others pendulous. According to Naudin, in whose opinion we concur,\r\n_C. longum_ DC.[1660] and _C. grossum_ Willd. are not specifically\r\ndistinct from this plant. It furnishes the larger kinds of Pod Pepper\r\nand, as we believe, much of the Cayenne Pepper which is imported in the\r\nstate of powder.\r\n\r\n=History=—All species of _Capsicum_ appear to be of American origin;\r\nno ancient Sanskrit or Chinese name for the genus is known, and the\r\nLatin and Greek names that have been referred to it are extremely\r\ndoubtful.[1661]\r\n\r\nThe earliest reference to the fruit as a condiment that we have met\r\nwith, occurs in a letter written in 1494 to the Chapter of Seville by\r\nChanca, physician to the fleet of Columbus in his second voyage to the\r\nWest Indies. The writer in noticing the productions of Hispaniola,\r\nremarks that the natives live on a root called _Age_, which they season\r\nwith a spice they term _Agi_, also eaten with fish and meat.[1662] The\r\nfirst of these words signifies _yam_, the second is the designation\r\nof Red Pepper, and still the common name for it in Spanish. Capsicum\r\nand its uses are more particularly described by Fernandez, who reached\r\nTropical America from Spain in A.D. 1514.[1663]\r\n\r\n[1659] Wight, _Icones Plant. Indiæ Orient._ iv. (1850) tab. 1617;\r\n_Capsicum minimum_ Roxb. _Flor. Ind._ i. (1832) 574. Faire has\r\nascertained that this is the _Capsicum frutescens_ of the _Species\r\nPlantarum_ of Linnæus, but not that of the _Hortus Cliffortianus_ of\r\nthe same botanist, to which latter the name _C. frutescens_ is usually\r\napplied.\r\n\r\n[1660] The chief distinction between _C. annuum_ and _C. longum_ is\r\nthat the former has an _erect_, the latter a _pendulous_ fruit.\r\n\r\n[1661] Dunal in De Cand. _Prodromus_, xiii. i. 412.\r\n\r\n[1662] _Letters of Christopher Columbus_, translated by Major (Hakluyt\r\nSociety), 1870. 68.\r\n\r\n[1663] _Historia de las Indias_, Madrid, i. (1851) 275.\r\n\r\nIn the _Historia Stirpium_ of Leonhard Fuchs, published at Basle\r\nin 1542, fol. 733, may be found the first and excellent figures of\r\n_Capsicum longum_ DC. under the name of _Siliquastrum_ or _Calicut\r\nPepper_; the author states that the plant has been introduced into\r\nGermany from India a few years previously. From this might be inferred\r\nan Indian origin; but on the other hand, Clusius asserts that the\r\nplant was brought from Pernambuco by the Portuguese, whose commercial\r\nintercourse with India would easily explain it being carried thither at\r\nan early period. He further states, that the American capsicum had been\r\ngenerally introduced into the gardens at Castille, and that it was used\r\nall the year round, green or dried, as a condiment and as pepper. He\r\nalso saw it cultivated in abundance at Brünn in Moravia in 1585.[1664]\r\n\r\n[1664] Caroli Clusii _Curæ posteriores_, Antverp., 1611. 95.\r\n\r\n_Capsicum longum_ DC. was grown in England by Gerarde (1597 _et\r\nantea_), who speaks of the pods as well known, and sold “in the shops\r\nat Billingsgate by the name of Ginnie Pepper.”\r\n\r\n=Description=—As already indicated, the Pod Pepper of commerce is of\r\ntwo kinds, namely:—\r\n\r\n1. Fruits of _Capsicum fastigiatum_—These are ½ to ¾ of an inch\r\nin length, by about ²/₁₀ of an inch in diameter, of an elongated,\r\nsubconical form, tapering to a blunt point, and slightly contracted\r\ntowards the base. The calyx, which is not always present, is\r\ncup-shaped, 5-toothed, 5-sided, supported on a slender, straight\r\npedicel, ¾ to 1 inch long. The fruits, which are somewhat compressed\r\nand shrivelled by drying, and also brittle when old, have a leathery,\r\nsmooth, shining translucent, thin, dry pericarp, of a dull orange-red,\r\nenclosing about 18 seeds, attached in two cells to a thin central\r\npartition. The seeds have the form of roundish or ovate discs, about\r\n⅛ of an inch in diameter, somewhat thickened at the edges; the embryo\r\nis curved, almost into a ring. The taste of the pericarp, and likewise\r\nof the seeds, is extremely pungent and fiery. The dried fruit has an\r\nodour by no means feeble, which we cannot compare to that of any other\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n2. Fruits of _Capsicum annuum_ of the commonest variety resemble those\r\nof _C. fastigiatum_, except that they are of longer size, being from 2\r\nto 3 or more inches in length, often rather more tapering towards the\r\nextremity. The seeds scarcely surpass in size those of _C. fastigiatum_.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The pericarp consists of two layers, the outer\r\nbeing composed of yellow thick-walled cells. The inner layer is twice\r\nas broad and exhibits a soft shrunken parenchyme, traversed by thin\r\nfibro-vascular bundles. The cells of the outer layer especially are\r\nthe seat of the fine granular colouring matter. If it is removed by\r\nan alcoholic solution of potash, a cell-nucleus and drops of fat oil\r\nmake their appearance. The structural details of this fruit afford\r\ninteresting subjects for microscopical investigation.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Bucholz in 1816, and about the same time\r\nBraconnot, traced the acridity of capsicum to a substance called\r\n_Capsicin_. It is obtained by treating the alcoholic extract of ether,\r\nand is a thick yellowish-red liquid, but slightly soluble in water.\r\nWhen gently heated, it becomes very fluid, and at a higher temperature\r\nis dissipated in fumes which are extremely irritating to respiration.\r\nIt is evidently a mixed substance, consisting of resinous and fatty\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nFelletár in 1869 exhausted capsicum fruits with dilute sulphuric acid,\r\nand distilled the decoction with potash. The distillate, which was\r\nstrongly alkaline and smelt like conine, was saturated with sulphuric\r\nacid, evaporated to dryness, and exhausted with absolute alcohol. The\r\nsolution, after evaporation of the alcohol, was treated with potash,\r\nand yielded by distillation a volatile alkaloid having the odour of\r\nconine.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments made by one of us (F.) we can fully confirm the\r\nobservations of Felletár. We have obtained the volatile base in\r\nquestion, and find it to have the smell of conine. It occurs both in\r\nthe pericarp and in the seeds, but in so small proportion that we\r\nwere unsuccessful in isolating it in sufficient quantity to allow of\r\naccurate examination.\r\n\r\nDragendorff states (1871) that petroleum ether is the best solvent for\r\nthe alkaloid of capsicum; he obtained crystals of its hydrochlorate,\r\nthe aqueous solution of which was precipitated by most of the usual\r\ntests, but not by tannic acid.\r\n\r\nThe colouring matter of capsicum fruits is sparingly soluble in\r\nalcohol, but readily in chloroform. After evaporation, an intensely red\r\nsoft mass is obtained, which is not much altered by potash; it turns\r\nfirst blue, then black with concentrated sulphuric acid, like many\r\nother yellow colouring substances. By alcohol chiefly _palmitic_ acid\r\nis extracted from the fruit, as shown by Thresh in 1877.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of _Capsicum fastigiatum_ have a somewhat strong odour; on\r\ndistilling consecutively two quantities, each of 50 lb., we obtained\r\na scanty amount of flocculent fatty matter, which possesses an odour\r\nsuggestive of parsley. Both this matter, as well as the distilled\r\nwater, were neutral to litmus paper, and the water tasteless. We\r\nseparated the latter, and exposed the remaining greasy mass to a\r\ntemperature of about 50° C., when it for the most part melted. The\r\nclear liquid on cooling solidified, and now consisted of tufted\r\ncrystals, which we further purified by recrystallization from alcohol.\r\nThus about 2 centigrammes were obtained of a neutral white stearoptene,\r\nhaving a decidedly aromatic, not very persistent taste, by _no\r\nmeans acrid_, but rather like that of the essential oil of parsley.\r\nThe crystals melted at 38° C. On keeping them for some days at the\r\ntemperature of the water-bath, covered with a watch-glass, some drops\r\nof essential oil were volatilized, which had the same taste and did\r\nnot solidify; the crystals were consequently accompanied by a liquid\r\noil. When kept for some days more in that condition, the crystals\r\nthemselves began to be volatilized, and the part remaining behind\r\nacquired a brownish hue. This no doubt points out another impurity,\r\nas we ascertained by the following experiment. With boiling solution\r\nof potash, the stearoptene produces a kind of soap, which on cooling\r\nyields a transparent jelly. If this is dissolved and diluted, it\r\nbecomes turbid by addition of an acid. This probably depends upon the\r\npresence of a little fatty matter, a suggestion which is confirmed by\r\nthe somewhat offensive smell given off by our stearoptene if it is\r\nheated in a glass tube.\r\n\r\nBuchheim’s “Capsicol”[1665] is in our opinion a doubtful substance.\r\n\r\nThresh (1876-1877) succeeded in isolating a well defined, highly active\r\nprinciple, the _Capsaicin_, from the extract which he obtained by\r\nexhausting Cayenne pepper with petroleum. From the red liquor dilute\r\ncaustic lye removes capsaicin, which is to be precipitated in minute\r\ncrystals by passing carbonic acid through the alkaline solution. They\r\nmay be purified by recrystallizing them from either alcohol, ether,\r\nbenzine, glacial acetic acid, or hot bisulphide of carbon; in petroleum\r\ncapsaicin is but very sparingly soluble, yet dissolves abundantly on\r\naddition of fatty oil. The latter being present in the pericarp is the\r\ncause why capsaicin can be extracted by the above process.\r\n\r\nThe crystals of capsaicin are colourless and answer to the formula\r\nC₉H₁₄O₂; they melt at 59° C. and begin to volatilize at 115° C.,\r\nbut decomposition can only be avoided by great care. The vapours of\r\ncapsaicin are of the most _dreadful acridity_, and even the ordinary\r\nmanipulation of that substance requires much precaution. Capsaicin is\r\nnot a glucoside; it is a powerful rubefacient, and taken internally\r\nproduces very violent burning in the stomach.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Chillies or Pod Pepper are shipped from Zanzibar, Western\r\nAfrica and Natal, but no general statistics of the quantity imported\r\ninto Great Britain are accessible.\r\n\r\nThe exports from Sierra Leone in 1871 reached 7258 lb.[1666] The colony\r\nof Natal, which produces Cayenne Pepper in the county of Victoria,\r\nwhere sugar cane and coffee are also grown, shipped in the same year\r\n9072 lb.[1667]\r\n\r\nOfficial returns[1668] show that in 1871 Singapore imported 1071 cwt.\r\n(119,952 lb.) of chillies, chiefly from Penang and Pegu. The spice is\r\nlargely consumed by the Chinese.\r\n\r\nBombay imported of dried chillies in the year 1872-3, 5567 cwt.\r\n(623,504 lb.) principally from the Madras Presidency, and exported 3323\r\ncwt.[1669]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Capsicum on account of its pungent properties is often\r\nadministered as a local stimulant in the form of gargle, and\r\noccasionally as a liniment; and internally to promote digestion. In all\r\nwarm countries it is much employed as a condiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX BELLADONNÆ.\r\n\r\n_Belladonna Root_; F. _Racine de Belladone_; G. _Belladonnawurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Atropa Belladonna_ L., a tall, glabrous or slightly\r\ndowny herb, with a perennial stock, native of central and Southern\r\nEurope, where it grows in the clearings of woods. The plant extends\r\neastward to the Crimea, Caucasia and Northern Asia Minor. In Britain it\r\nis chiefly found in the southern counties, but even of these it is a\r\ndoubtful native.\r\n\r\n[1665] _Jahresbericht_ of Wiggers and Husemann, 1873. 567; also\r\n_Yearbook of Pharm._ 1876. 251.\r\n\r\n[1666] _Blue Book_ of the Colony of Sierra Leone for 1871.\r\n\r\n[1667] Do. of Natal for 1871.\r\n\r\n[1668] Do. of the Straits Settlements for 1871.\r\n\r\n[1669] _Statement of the Trade and Navigation of Bombay for 1872-73_,\r\npt. ii. 58. 91.\r\n\r\nIn a few localities in England and France, as well as in North America,\r\nthe plant is cultivated for medicinal use.\r\n\r\n=History=—Although a plant so striking as belladonna can hardly have\r\nbeen unknown to the classical authors, it cannot with certainty be\r\nidentified in their writings.\r\n\r\nSaladinus of Ascoli,[1670] who wrote an enumeration of medicinal plants\r\nabout A.D. 1450, names the leaves of both _Solatrum furiale_ and\r\n_Solatrum minus_, the former of which is probably _Belladonna_. However\r\nthis may be, the first indubitable notice of it that we have met with,\r\nis in the _Grand Herbier_ printed at Paris, probably about 1504.[1671]\r\nThe plant is also mentioned about this period as _Solatrum mortale_ or\r\n_Dolwurtz_, in the writings of Hieronymus Brunschwyg.[1672]\r\n\r\nIn 1542 belladonna was well figured as _Solanum somniferum_ or\r\n_Dollkraut_ by the German botanist Leonhard Fuchs, who fully recognized\r\nits poisonous properties.[1673] Yet it was confounded by other writers\r\nof this period as Tragus,[1674] who reproduced Fuchs’ figure as\r\n“_Solanum hortense_!” _Strygium_ and _Strychnon_ were other names not\r\nunfrequently applied to Atropa during the 16th and 17th centuries.\r\n\r\nMatthiolus, who terms the plant _Solatrum majus_, states[1675] that\r\nit is commonly called by the Venetians _Herba Bella donna_, from the\r\ncircumstance of the Italian ladies using a distilled water of the plant\r\nas a cosmetic. Gesner[1676] was also familiar with the name Belladonna.\r\nThe introduction of the root of belladonna into British medicine is of\r\nrecent date, and is due to Mr. Peter Squire of London, who recommended\r\nit as the basis of a useful anodyne liniment, about the year 1860.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Belladonna has a large, fleshy, tapering root, 1 to 2\r\ninches thick, and a foot or more in length, from which diverge stout\r\nbranches. Externally the fresh roots are of an earthy brown, rough with\r\ncracks and transverse ridges. The bark is thick and juicy, and as well\r\nas the more fibrous central portion, is internally of a dull creamy\r\nwhite. A transverse section of the main root shows a distinct radiate\r\nstructure. The root has an earthy smell with but very little taste at\r\nfirst, but a powerfully acrid after-taste is soon developed.\r\n\r\n_Dried root of Belladonna_ is sold in rough irregular pieces of a\r\ndirty greyish colour, whitish internally, breaking easily with a short\r\nfracture, and having an earthy smell not unlike that of liquorice root.\r\nThe bark being probably the chief seat of the alkaloid, roots not\r\nexceeding the thickness of the finger should be preferred. The drug\r\nis for the most part imported from Germany, and is often of doubtful\r\nquality. English-grown root purchased in a fresh state (the large and\r\nold being rejected), then washed, cut into transverse segments and\r\ndried by a gentle heat, furnishes a more reliable and satisfactory\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n[1670] _Compendium Aromatariorum_, 1488.\r\n\r\n[1671] _Le Grant Herbier en francoys, contenāt les qualitez, vertus\r\net proprietez des herbes_ etc., Paris (no date) 4°. cap. _De Solastro\r\nrustico._\r\n\r\n[1672] _Das destillier Buch_ (sub voce _Nachtschet Wasser_).\r\nStrassburg, 1521, fol. 93 _b_.

Dioscoridis_, Venetiis, 1558. 533.\r\n\r\n[1676] _De hortis Germaniæ_, Argentorat. 1561, fol. 282.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—There is a considerable structural difference\r\nbetween the main root and its branches, the former alone containing\r\na distinct pith. This pith is included in a woody circle, traversed\r\nby narrow medullary rays. In the outer part of the woody circle,\r\nparenchymatous tissue is more prevalent than vascular bundles. The\r\ntransverse section of the branches of the root exhibits a central\r\nvascular bundle instead of a medullary column. The outer vascular\r\nbundles show no regular arrangement; and medullary rays are not clearly\r\nobvious in the transverse section.\r\n\r\nThe woody parts, both of the main root and its branches, contain very\r\nlarge dotted vessels accompanied by a prosenchymatous tissue. The cells\r\nof the latter, however, are always thin-walled; the absence of proper\r\nso-called ligneous tissue explains the easy fracture of the root.\r\nSometimes the prosenchyme in which the vessels are imbedded assumes\r\na brownish hue and a waxy appearance, and such parts exhibit a very\r\nirregular structure.\r\n\r\nIn the cortical portion of belladonna root, many of the cells of the\r\nmiddle layer, and likewise some of the central parts of the root, are\r\nloaded with extremely small octahedric crystals of calcium oxalate.\r\nBut most of the parenchymatous cells are filled up with small starch\r\ngranules.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—In 1833 Mein prepared from the root, and Geiger\r\nand Hesse from the herb, the crystallizable alkaloid _Atropine_. The\r\nresearches of Lefort (1872) have proved that the roots contain it in\r\nvery variable proportions, the young being much richer in alkaloid than\r\nthe old.[1677] The maximum proportion obtained was 0·6 per cent.; this\r\nwas from root of the thickness of the finger. Large old roots, 7 or 8\r\nyears of age, afford from 0·25 to 0·31 per cent. They have besides a\r\nsmaller proportion of bark than young roots, and it is chiefly in the\r\nbark that the alkaloid appears to reside. Manufacturers of atropine\r\nemploy exclusively the root.\r\n\r\nLudwig and Pfeiffer (1861), by decomposing atropine with potassium\r\nchromate and sulphuric acid, obtained benzoic acid and propylamine.\r\nOther products are formed when atropine is treated with strong\r\nhydrochloric acid, baryta water or caustic soda, thus—_Atropine_,\r\nC₁₇H₂₃NO₂ + H₂O = _Tropic Acid_, C₉H₁₀O₃ + _Tropine_, C₈H₁₅NO.\r\n\r\n    Tropic acid, C₆H₅C(OH) {CH₃\r\n                           {COOH,\r\n\r\nbeing further boiled with the same agents is converted into\r\n\r\n    atropic acid, C₆H₅C {CH₂\r\n                        {COOH,\r\n\r\nwhich, especially by using hydrochloric acid, is gradually transformed\r\ninto isotropic acid. Both these acids are isomeric to cinnamic acid,\r\nC₉H₈O₂, but otherwise remarkably dissimilar.\r\n\r\nTropine is a strongly alkaline body, readily soluble both in water and\r\nalcohol, and furnishing tabular crystals by the evaporation of its\r\nsolution in ether. Neither tropine nor tropic acid, it is stated by\r\nKraut (1863), is present in the leaves and root of belladonna.\r\n\r\nHübschmann (1858) detected in belladonna root a second but\r\nuncrystallizable alkaloid, called _Belladonnine_; it has a resinous\r\naspect, is distinctly alkaline, and when heated emits, like atropine, a\r\npeculiar odour.\r\n\r\n[1677] For Lefort’s process for estimating atropine, see p. 458.\r\n\r\nThe root further contains, according to Richter (1837) and Hübschmann,\r\na fluorescent substance, as well as a red colouring matter called\r\n_Atrosin_.[1678] The latter occurs in greatest abundance in the fruit,\r\nand would probably repay further investigation.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Belladonna root is chiefly used for the preparation of atropine,\r\nwhich is employed for dilating the pupil of the eye. A liniment made\r\nwith belladonna root is used for the relief of neuralgic pains.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—We may point out that the roots of _Mandragora\r\nmicrocarpa_, _M. officinarum_, and _M. vernalis_ Bertoloni are very\r\nnearly allied to the root under notice, both in external appearance\r\nand in their structure. They are not likely to be confounded with\r\nBelladonna root, their mother plants being indigenous in the South of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLIA BELLADONNÆ.\r\n\r\n_Belladonna Leaves_; F. _Feuilles de Belladone_; G. _Tollkraut_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Atropa Belladonna_ L. (p. 455).\r\n\r\n=History=—Belladonna Leaves and the extract prepared from them\r\nwere introduced into the London Pharmacopœia of 1809. For further\r\nparticulars regarding the history of belladonna, see the preceding\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Belladonna or Deadly Nightshade produces thick, smooth\r\nherbaceous stems, which attain a height of 4 to 5 feet. They are simple\r\nin their lower parts, then usually 3-forked, and afterwards 2-forked,\r\nproducing in their upper branches an abundance of bright green leaves,\r\narranged in unequal pairs, from the bases of which spring the solitary,\r\npendulous, purplish, bell-shaped flowers, and large shining black\r\nberries.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are 3 to 6 inches long, stalked, broadly ovate, acuminate,\r\nattenuated at the base, soft and juicy; those of barren roots are\r\nalternate and solitary. The young shoots are clothed with a soft, short\r\npubescence, which on the calyx is somewhat more persistent, assuming\r\nthe character of viscid, glandular hairs. If bruised, the leaves emit\r\na somewhat offensive, herbaceous odour which is destroyed by drying.\r\nWhen dried, they are thin and friable, of a brownish-green on the upper\r\nsurface and greyish beneath, with a disagreeable, faintly bitter taste.\r\nOf fresh leaves 100 lb. yield 16 lb. of dried (Squire).\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The important constituent of belladonna leaves\r\nis _Atropine_. Lefort (1872)[1679] estimated its amount by exhausting\r\nthe leaves previously dried at 100° C. by means of dilute alcohol,\r\nconcentrating the tincture, and throwing down the alkaloid with a\r\nsolution of iodohydrargyrate of potassium. The precipitate thus\r\nobtained was calculated to contain 33·25 per cent. of atropine. Lefort\r\nexamined leaves from plants both cultivated and growing wild in the\r\nenvirons of Paris, and gathered either before or after flowering. He\r\nfound cultivation not to affect the percentage of alkaloid,—that the\r\nleaves of the young plant were rather less rich than those taken at the\r\nperiod of full inflorescence,—and that the latter (dried) yielded 0·44\r\nto 0·48 per cent. of atropine.\r\n\r\n[1678] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, xvii.

The estimation was performed\r\nin nearly the same way as that followed by Lefort.\r\n\r\nBelladonna herb yields _Asparagin_, which according to Biltz (1839)\r\ncrystallizes out of the extract after long keeping. The crystals found\r\nin the extract by Attfield (1862) were however chloride and nitrate\r\nof potassium. The same chemist obtained by dialysis of the juice of\r\nbelladonna, nitrate of potassium, and square prisms of a salt of\r\nmagnesium containing some organic acid; the juice likewise affords\r\nammonia.[1681] The dried leaves yielded us 14·5 per cent. of ash\r\nconsisting mainly of calcareous and alkaline carbonates.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The fresh leaves are used for making _Extractum Belladonnæ_, and\r\nthe dried for preparing a tincture. They should be gathered while the\r\nplant is well in flower.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBA STRAMONII.\r\n\r\n_Stramonium_, _Thornapple_; F. _Herbe de Stramoine_; G.\r\n_Stechapfelblätter_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Datura[1682] Stramonium_ L., a large,\r\nquick-growing, upright annual, with white flowers like a convolvulus,\r\nand ovoid spiny fruits. It is now found as a weed of cultivation in\r\nalmost all the temperate and warmer regions of the globe. In the south\r\nof England it is often met with in rich waste ground, chiefly near\r\ngardens or habitations.\r\n\r\n=History=—The question of the native country and early distribution of\r\n_D. Stramonium_ has been much discussed by botanical writers. Alphonse\r\nDe Candolle,[1683] who has ably reviewed the arguments advanced in\r\nfavour of the plant being a native respectively of Europe and America\r\nor Asia, enounces his opinion thus:—that _D. Stramonium_ L. appears to\r\nbe indigenous to the Old World, probably the borders of the Caspian\r\nSea or adjacent regions, but certainly not of India; that it is very\r\ndoubtful if it existed in Europe in the time of the ancient Roman\r\nEmpire, but that it appears to have spread itself between that period\r\nand the discovery of America.\r\n\r\nStramonium was cultivated in London towards the close of the 16th\r\ncentury by Gerarde, who received the seed from Constantinople and\r\nfreely propagated the plant, of the medicinal value of which he had a\r\nhigh opinion. The use of the herb in more recent times is due to the\r\nexperiments of Störck.[1684]\r\n\r\n[1680] _Werthbestimmung stark wirkender Droguen_, Petersburg, 1876. 28.\r\n\r\n[1681] The fresh juice kept for a few days has been known to evolve\r\n_red vapours_ (nitrous acid?) when the vessel containing it was\r\nopened.—H.

At each\r\nfurcation and directed outwards is a large leaf. This arrangement of\r\nparts is repeated, and as the plant grows vigorously, it often becomes\r\nmuch branched and acquires in the course of the summer a considerable\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of stramonium have long petioles, are unequal at the base,\r\noval, acuminate, sinuate-dentate with large irregular pointed teeth\r\nor lobes, downy when young, glabrous at maturity. When fresh they are\r\nsomewhat firm and juicy, emitting when handled a disagreeable fœtid\r\nsmell. The larger leaves of plants of moderate growth attain a length\r\nof 6 to 8 or more inches.\r\n\r\nFor medicinal purposes, the entire plants are pulled up, the leaves and\r\nyounger shoots are stripped off, quickly dried, and then broken and cut\r\ninto short lengths, so as to be conveniently smoked in a pipe, that\r\nbeing the method in which the drug is chiefly consumed in England. The\r\noffensive smell of the fresh plant is lost by drying, being replaced\r\nby a rather agreeable tea-like odour. The dried herb has a bitterish\r\nsaline taste.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The leaves of stramonium contain, in common with\r\nthe seeds, the alkaloid _Daturine_ (see p. 461), but in extremely small\r\nproportion, not exceeding in fact ²/₁₀ to ³/₁₀ per mille. They are rich\r\nin saline and earthy constituents; selected leaves dried at 100° C.\r\nyielded us 17·4 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Scarcely employed in any other way than in smoking like tobacco\r\nfor the relief of asthma.—Col. Grant (1871) found the herb to be smoked\r\nin pipes by the Nubians for chest-complaint.\r\n\r\n=Substitute=—_Datura Tatula_ L.—This plant is closely allied to _D.\r\nStramonium_ L., propagating itself on rich cultivated ground with\r\nnearly the same facility; but it is not so generally diffused.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle is of opinion that it is indigenous to the warmer parts of\r\nAmerica, whence it was imported into Europe in the 16th century, and\r\nnaturalized first in Italy, and then in South-Western Europe. By many\r\nbotanists it has been united to _D. Stramonium_, but Naudin,[1685]\r\nwho has studied both plants with the greatest attention, especially\r\nwith reference to their hybrids, is decidedly in favour of considering\r\nthem distinct. _D. Tatula_ differs from _D. Stramonium_ in having\r\nstem, petiole, and nerves of leaves _purplish_ instead of _green_; and\r\ncorolla and anthers of a _violet_ colour instead of _white_,—characters\r\nwhich, it must be admitted, are of very small botanical value.\r\n\r\n_D. Tatula_ has been recommended for smoking in cases of asthma, on\r\nthe ground of its being _stronger_ than _D. Stramonium_; but we are\r\nnot aware of any authority as to the comparative strength of the two\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n[1685] _Comptes Rendus_, lv.

It is bilocular, with each cell\r\nincompletely divided into two, and contains a large number (about 400)\r\nof flattened, kidney-shaped seeds. The seeds are blackish or dark\r\nbrown, about 2 lines long and ½ a line thick, thinning off towards\r\nthe hilum which is on the straighter side. The surface of the seed is\r\nfinely pitted and also marked with a much coarser series of shallow\r\nreticulations or rugosities. A section parallel to the faces of the\r\nseed exhibits the long, contorted embryo, following the outline of the\r\ntesta, and bedded in the oily white albumen. The cylindrical form of\r\nthe embryo is seen in a transverse section of the seed.\r\n\r\nThe seeds have a bitterish taste, and when bruised a disagreeable\r\nodour. When the entire seeds are immersed in dilute alcohol, they\r\nafford a tincture displaying a beautiful green fluorescence, turning\r\nyellow on addition of ammonia.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The testa is formed of a row of radially\r\nextended, thick-walled cells. They are not of a simply cylindrical\r\nform, but their walls are sinuously bent in and out in the direction\r\nof their length. Viewed in a direction tangential to the surface, the\r\ncells appear as if indented one into the other. Towards the surface of\r\nthe seed the cell-walls are elevated as dark brown tubercles and folds,\r\ngiving to the seed its reticulated and pitted surface. The albumen and\r\nembryo exhibit the usual contents, namely fatty oil and albuminoid\r\nsubstances.[1686]\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The active constituent of stramonium seeds is\r\nthe highly poisonous alkaloid _Daturine_, of which they afford only\r\nabout ⅒ per cent., while the leaves and roots contain it in still\r\nsmaller proportion.[1687] Daturine was discovered in 1833 by Geiger\r\nand Hesse, and regarded as identical with atropine by A. von Planta\r\n(1850), who found it to have the same composition as that alkaloid.\r\nThe two bodies exhibit the same relations as to solubility and fusing\r\npoint (88-90° C.); and they also agree in crystallizing easily. The\r\nexperiments of Schroff (1852), tending to show that although daturine\r\nand atropine act in the same manner, the latter has twice the poisonous\r\nenergy of the former, raised a further question as to the identity of\r\nthe two alkaloids. Poehl (1876) also stated solutions of daturine to\r\nbe levogyrate, those of atropine being devoid of rotatory power. From\r\nthe observations of Erhard (1866), it would appear that the crystalline\r\nform of some of the salts of atropine and daturine is different. In\r\nstramonium seeds daturine appears to be combined with malic acid. The\r\nseeds yielded to Cloëz (1865) 2·9 per cent. of ash and 25 per cent. of\r\nfixed oil.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Stramonium seeds are prescribed in the form of extract or\r\ntincture as a sedative or narcotic.\r\n\r\n[1686] We have not seen W.

The capsules are pendulous, of depressed globular form,\r\nrather broader than high, covered with sharp tubercles or thick short\r\nspines. They do not open by regular valves as in _D. Stramonium_, but\r\nsplit in different directions and break up into irregular fragments.\r\n\r\n_D. alba_ appears to be scarcely distinct from _D. fastuosa_ L.\r\nBoth are common in India, and are grown in gardens in the south of\r\nEurope.[1688]\r\n\r\n=History=—The mediæval Arabian physicians were familiar with _Datura\r\nalba_, which is well described by Ibn Baytar[1689] under precisely the\r\nsame Arabic name (_Jouz-masal_) that it bears at the present day; they\r\nwere also fully aware of its poisonous properties.\r\n\r\nGarcia de Orta[1690] (1563) observed the plant in India, and has\r\nnarrated that its flowers or seeds are put into food to intoxicate\r\npersons it was designed to rob. It was also described by Christoval\r\nAcosta, who in his book on Indian drugs[1691] mentions two other\r\nvarieties, one of them with yellow flowers, the seeds of either being\r\nvery poisonous, and often administered with criminal intent, as well\r\nas for the cure of disease. Graham[1692] says of the plant that it\r\npossesses very strong narcotic properties, and has on several occasions\r\nbeen fatally used by Bombay thieves, who have administered it in order\r\nto deprive their victims of the power of resistance.\r\n\r\nThe seeds and fresh leaves have a place in the _Pharmacopœia of India_,\r\n1868.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The seeds of _D. alba_ are very different in appearance\r\nfrom those of _D. Stramonium_, being of a light yellowish-brown, rather\r\nlarger size, irregular in shape and somewhat shrivelled. Their form has\r\nbeen likened to the human ear; they are in fact obscurely triangular or\r\nflattened-pearshaped, the rounded end being thickened into a sinuous,\r\nconvoluted, triple ridge, while the centre of the seed is somewhat\r\ndepressed. The hilum runs from the pointed end nearly half-way up the\r\nlength of the seed. The testa is marked with minute rugosities, but is\r\nnot so distinctly pitted as in the seed of the _D. Stramonium_; it is\r\nalso more developed, exhibiting in section large intercellular spaces\r\nto which are due its spongy texture. The seeds of the two species agree\r\nin internal structure as well as in taste; but those of _D. alba_ do\r\nnot give a fluorescent tincture.\r\n\r\n[1688] Seeds of _D. alba_ sent to us from Madras by Dr. Bidie, were\r\nsown by our friend M. Naudin of Collioure (Pyrénées Orientales), and\r\nproduced the plant under three forms, viz.:—1. The true _D. alba_ as\r\nfigured in Wight’s _Icones_.—2. Plants with flowers, violet without and\r\nnearly white within (_D. fastuosa_).—3.

They evolve an\r\noffensive odour when handled.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The testa is built up of the same tissues as\r\nin _D. Stramonium_, but the thick-walled cells constituting the spongy\r\npart are far larger, and distinctly show numerous secondary deposits,\r\nmaking a fine object for the microscope.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Neither the seeds nor the leaves of _D. alba_\r\nhave yet been examined chemically, but there can scarcely be any doubt\r\nthat their very active properties are due to _Daturine_, for the\r\npreparation of which the former would probably be the best source.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The seeds in the form of tincture or extract have been employed\r\nin India as a sedative and narcotic, and the fresh leaves, bruised and\r\nmade into a poultice with flour, as an anodyne application.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLIA HYOSCYAMI.\r\n\r\n_Henbane Leaves_; F. _Feuilles de Jusquiame_; G. _Bilsenkraut_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Hyoscyamus niger_ L., a coarse, erect herb, with\r\nsoft, viscid, hairy foliage of unpleasant odour, pale yellowish flowers\r\nelegantly marked with purple veins, and 5-toothed bottle-shaped calyx.\r\nIt is found throughout Europe from Portugal and Greece to Central\r\nNorway and Finland, in Egypt, Asia Minor, the Caucasus, Persia, Siberia\r\nand Northern India. As a weed of cultivation it now grows also in North\r\nAmerica[1693] and Brazil. In Britain it occurs wild, chiefly in waste\r\nplaces near buildings; and is cultivated for medicinal use.\r\n\r\nHenbane exists under two varieties, known as _annual_ and _biennial_,\r\nbut scarcely presenting any other distinctive character.\r\n\r\n_Biennial Henbane_ (_Hyoscyamus niger_ var. α. _biennis_) is most\r\nesteemed for pharmaceutical preparations. It is raised by seed, the\r\nplant producing the first year only a rosette of luxuriant stalked\r\nleaves, 12 or more inches in length. In the second, it throws up a\r\nflower stem of 2 to 3 feet in height, and the whole plant dies as the\r\nfruit matures.\r\n\r\n_Annual Henbane_ (_H. niger_ var. β. _annua_, vel _agrestis_) is a\r\nsmaller plant, coming to perfection in a single season. It is the usual\r\nwild form, but it is also grown by the herbalists.[1694]\r\n\r\n=History=—Hyoscyamus, under which name it is probable the nearly allied\r\nSouth European species, _H. albus_ L., was generally intended, was\r\nmedicinal among the ancients, and particularly commended by Dioscorides.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, henbane has been employed from remote times. Benedictus\r\nCrispus, archbishop of Milan, in a work written shortly before A.D.\r\n681, notices it under the name of _Hyoscyamus_ and _Symphoniaca_.[1695]\r\nIn the 10th century, its virtues were particularly recorded by Macer\r\nFloridus[1696] who called it _Jusquiamus_.\r\n\r\n[1693] It had become naturalized in North America prior to 1672,\r\nas we find it mentioned by Josselyn in his _New England’s Rarities\r\ndiscovered_ (Lond. 1672) among the plants “sprung up since the English\r\nplanted and kept cattle in New England.”\r\n\r\n[1694] _Pharm.

(1852) 74. 84.\r\n\r\n[1696] _De Viribus Herbarum_, edited by Choulant, Lips. 1832. 108.\r\n\r\nFrequent mention is made of it in the Anglo-Saxon works on medicine of\r\nthe 11th century,[1697] in which it is called _Henbell_, and sometimes\r\n_Belene_, the latter word perhaps traceable in βιλινουντία, which\r\nDioscorides[1698] gives as the Gallic designation of the plant. In the\r\n13th century henbane was also used by the Welsh “Physicians of Myddvai.”\r\n\r\nThe word _Hennibone_, with the Latin and French synonyms _Jusquiamus_\r\nand _Chenille_, occurs in a vocabulary of the 13th century;\r\nand _Hennebane_ in a Latin and English vocabulary of the 15th\r\ncentury.[1699] In the _Arbolayre_, a printed French herbal of the 15th\r\ncentury,[1700] we find the plant described as _Hanibane_ or _Hanebane_\r\nwith the following explanation—“Elle est aultrement appeler cassilago\r\net aultrement simphoniaca. La semence proprement a nom jusquiame\r\nou hanebane, et herbe a nom cassilago....” Both _Hyoscyamus_ and\r\n_Jusquiamus_ are from the Greek Ὑοσκύαμος, i.e. _Hog-bean_.\r\n\r\nThough a remedy undeniably potent, henbane in the first half of the\r\nlast century had fallen into disuse. It was omitted from the London\r\npharmacopœias of 1746 and 1788, and restored only in 1809. Its\r\nre-introduction into medicine was chiefly due to the experiments and\r\nrecommendations of Störck.[1701]\r\n\r\nDuring the middle ages the seeds and roots of henbane were also much\r\nused.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The stems of henbane, whether of the annual or biennial\r\nform, are clothed with soft, viscid, hairy leaves, of which the\r\nupper constitute the large, sessile, coarsely toothed bracts of the\r\nunilateral flower-spike. The middle leaves are more toothed and\r\nsubamplexicaul. The lower leaves are stalked, ovate-oblong, coarsely\r\ndentate, and of large size. The stems, leaves, and calyces of henbane\r\nare thickly beset with long, soft, jointed hairs; the last joint of\r\nmany of these hairs exudes a viscid substance occasioning the fresh\r\nplant to feel clammy to the touch. In the cultivated plant, the\r\nhairiness diminishes.\r\n\r\nAfter drying, the broad light-coloured midrib becomes very conspicuous,\r\nwhile the rest of the leaf shrinks much and acquires a greyish green\r\nhue. The drug derived from the flowering plant as found in commerce is\r\nusually much broken. The fœtid, narcotic odour of the fresh leaves is\r\ngreatly diminished by drying. The fresh plant has but little taste.\r\n\r\nDried henbane is sold under three forms, which are not however\r\ngenerally distinguished by druggists. These are 1. _Annual plant_,\r\nfoliage and green tops. 2. _Biennial plant_, leaves of the first year.\r\n3. _Biennial plant_, foliage and green tops. The third form is always\r\nregarded as the best, but no attempt has been made to determine with\r\naccuracy the relative merits of the three sorts.\r\n\r\n[1697] _Leechdoms etc. of Early England_, iii.

(1860)\r\n377.\r\n\r\n[1701] See p. 459, note 5.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—_Hyoscyamine_, the most important among the\r\nconstituents of henbane, was obtained in an impure state by Geiger\r\nand Hesse in 1833. Höhn in 1871 first isolated it from the seeds,\r\nwhich are far richer in it than the leaves.[1702] The seeds are\r\ndeprived of the fatty oil (26 per cent.) and treated with spirit of\r\nwine containing sulphuric acid, which takes out the hyoscyamine in\r\nthe form of sulphate. The alcohol is then evaporated and tannic acid\r\nadded; the precipitate thus obtained is mixed with lime and exhausted\r\nwith alcohol. The hyoscyamine is again converted into a sulphate,\r\nthe aqueous solution of which is then precipitated with carbonate\r\nof sodium, and the alkaloid dissolved by means of ether. After the\r\nevaporation of the ether, hyoscyamine remains as an oily liquid which\r\nafter some time concretes into wart-like tufted crystals, soluble in\r\nbenzol, chloroform, ether, as well as in water. Höhn and Reichardt\r\nassign to hyoscyamine the formula C₁₅H₂₃O₃. The seeds yield of it only\r\n0·05 per cent.\r\n\r\nHyoscyamine is easily decomposed by caustic alkalis. By boiling with\r\nbaryta in aqueous solution, it is split into _Hyoscine_, C₆H₁₃N, and\r\n_Hyoscinic Acid_, C₉H₁₀O₃. The former is a volatile oily liquid of a\r\nnarcotic odour and alkaline reaction. By keeping it over sulphuric\r\nacid it crystallizes and also yields crystallized salts; hyoscine may\r\nbe closely allied to conine, C₈H₁₅N. Hyoscinic acid, a crystallizable\r\nsubstance having an odour resembling that of empyreumatic benzoic\r\nacid.[1703] It melts, according to Höhn, at 105°; tropic acid (see p.\r\n457), melting at 118°, agrees so very nearly with hyoscinic acid that\r\nfurther researches will probably prove these acids to be identical.\r\n\r\nAnother process for extracting hyoscyamine is due (1875) to Thibaut. He\r\nremoves by bisulphide of carbon the fatty oil from the powdered seeds,\r\nand exhausts them with alcohol slightly acidulated by tartaric acid.\r\nThe alcohol being distilled off, the author precipitates the alkaloid\r\nby means of a solution containing 6 per cent. of iodide of potassium\r\nand 3 per cent. iodine. By decomposing the precipitate with sulphurous\r\nacid, hydroiodic acid and sulphate of hyoscyamine are formed. The\r\nlatter is dried up at 35° with magnesia and the hyoscyamine extracted\r\nby alcohol or chloroform. The crystals melt at 90°. Thibaut found the\r\nalkaloid thus prepared from seeds differing from that yielded by the\r\nleaves, the latter having a somewhat strong odour.\r\n\r\nAttfield[1704] has pointed out that extract of henbane is rich in\r\nnitrate of potassium and other inorganic salts. In the leaves, the\r\namount of nitrate is, according to Thorey,[1705] largest before\r\nflowering, and the same observation applies to hyoscyamine.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Henbane in the form of tincture or extract is administered\r\nas a sedative, anodyne or hypnotic. The impropriety of giving it in\r\nconjunction with free potash or soda, which render it perfectly inert,\r\nhas been demonstrated by the experiments of Garrod.[1706] Hyoscyamine,\r\nlike atropine, powerfully dilates the pupil of the eye.\r\n\r\n[1702] From the experiments of Schoonbroodt (1868), there is reason\r\nto believe that the active principle of henbane can be more easily\r\nextracted from the _fresh_ than from the _dried_ plant.\r\n\r\n[1703] I have had the opportunity of examining the above substances as\r\nprepared by the said chemists.—F.

Its\r\ncultivation is carried on in most temperate and subtropical countries.\r\n\r\n=History=—It is stated by C. Ph. von Martius[1707] that the practice\r\nof smoking tobacco has been widely diffused from time immemorial among\r\nthe natives of South America, as well as among the inhabitants of the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi as far north as the plant can be cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards became acquainted with tobacco when they landed in Cuba\r\nin 1492, and on their return introduced it into Europe for the sake\r\nof its medicinal properties. The custom of inhaling the smoke of the\r\nherb was learnt from the Indians, and by the end of the 16th century\r\nhad become generally known throughout Spain and Portugal, whence it\r\npassed into the rest of Europe, and into Turkey, Egypt, and India,\r\nnotwithstanding that it was opposed by the severest enactments both of\r\nChristian and Mahommedan governments. It is commonly believed that the\r\npractice of smoking tobacco was much promoted in England, as well as in\r\nthe north of Europe generally, by the example of Sir Walter Raleigh and\r\nhis companions.\r\n\r\nTobacco was introduced into China, probably by way of Japan or Manila,\r\nduring the 16th or 17th century, but its use was prohibited by the\r\nemperors both of the Ming and Tsing dynasties. It is now cultivated in\r\nmost of the provinces, and is universally employed.[1708]\r\n\r\nThe first tolerably exact description of the tobacco plant is that\r\ngiven by Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdés, governor of St. Domingo,\r\nin his _Historia general de las Indias_,[1709] printed at Seville in\r\n1535. In this work, the plant is said to be smoked through a branched\r\ntube of the shape of the letter =Y=, which the natives call _Tabaco_.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the middle of the 16th century that growing tobacco\r\nwas seen in Europe,—first at Lisbon, whence the French ambassador, Jean\r\nNicot, sent seeds to France in 1560 as those of a valuable medicinal\r\nplant, which was even then diffused throughout Portugal.[1710]\r\n\r\nMonardes,[1711] writing in 1571, speaks of tobacco as brought to Spain\r\na few years previously, and valued for its beauty and for its medicinal\r\nvirtues. Of the latter he gives a long account, noticing also the\r\nmethods of smoking and chewing the herb prevalent among the Indians. He\r\nalso supplies a small woodcut representing the plant, which he states\r\nto have white flowers, red in the centre.\r\n\r\n[1707] _Beiträge zur Ethnographie und Sprachenkunde Americas, zumal\r\nBrasiliens_, i.

Tabacum_ is\r\nby far the most frequent, and is almost the only one named in the\r\npharmacopœias as medicinal. Its simple stem, bearing at the summit a\r\npanicle of tubular pink flowers, and growing to the height of a man,\r\nhas oblong, lanceolate simple leaves, with the margin entire. The lower\r\nleaves, more broadly lanceolate, and about 2 feet long by 6 inches\r\nwide, are shortly stalked. The stem-leaves are semi-amplexicaul, and\r\ndecurrent at the base. Cultivation sometimes produces cordate-ovate\r\nforms of leaf, or a margin more or less uneven, or nearly revolute.\r\n\r\nAll the herbaceous parts of the plant are clothed with long soft hairs,\r\nmade up of broad, ribbon-like, striated cells, the points of which\r\nexude a glutinous liquid. Small sessile glands are situated here and\r\nthere on the surface of the leaf.[1714] The lateral veins proceed from\r\nthe thick midrib in straight lines, at angles of 40° to 75°, gently\r\ncurving upwards only near the edge. In drying, the leaves become\r\nbrittle and as thin as paper, and always acquire a brown colour. Even\r\nby the most careful treatment of a single leaf, it is not possible to\r\npreserve the green hue.\r\n\r\nThe smell of the fresh plant is narcotic; its taste bitter and\r\nnauseous. The characteristic odour of dried tobacco is developed during\r\nthe process of curing.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The active principle of tobacco, first isolated\r\nin 1828 by Posselt and Reimann, is a volatile, highly poisonous\r\nalkaloid termed _Nicotine_, C₁₀H₁₄N₂. It is easily extracted from\r\ntobacco by means of alcohol or water, as a malate, from which the\r\nalkaloid can be separated by shaking it with caustic lye and ether. The\r\nether is then expelled by warming the liquid, which finally has to be\r\nmixed with slaked lime and distilled in a stream of hydrogen, when the\r\nnicotine begins to come over at about 200° C.\r\n\r\n[1712] _Instruction sur l’herbe Petum ditte en France l’herbe de la\r\nRoyne ou Médicée_ ...

See Pocklington,\r\n_Pharm. Journal_, v. (1874) 301.\r\n\r\nNicotine is a colourless oily liquid, of sp. gr. 1·027 at 15° C.,\r\ndeviating the plane of polarization to the left; it boils at 247° and\r\ndoes not concrete even at -10° C. It has a strongly alkaline reaction,\r\nan unpleasant odour, and a burning taste. It quickly assumes a brown\r\ncolour on exposure to air and light; and appears even to undergo an\r\nalteration by repeated distillation in an atmosphere deprived of\r\noxygen. Nicotine dissolves in water, but separates on addition of\r\ncaustic potash; it occurs in the dried leaves to the extent of about 6\r\nper cent., but is subject to great variation. The seeds of tobacco are\r\nstated by Kosutany[1715] as grown in Hungary to contain from 0·28 to\r\n0·67 per cent. of the alkaloid.\r\n\r\nIt has not been met with in tobacco-smoke by Vohl and Eulenberg\r\n(1871), though other chemists assert its occurrence. The vapours\r\nwere found by the former to contain numerous basic substances of the\r\npicolinic series, and ceded to caustic potash, hydrocyanic acid,[1716]\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, several volatile fatty acids, phenol and\r\ncreasote. There was further observed in the imperfect combustion\r\nof tobacco the formation of laminæ fusible at 94° C., and having a\r\ncomposition C₁₉H₁₈. Oxide of carbon is also largely met with.\r\n\r\nTobacco leaves, whether fresh or dried, yield when distilled with water\r\na turbid distillate in which, as observed by Hermbstädt in 1823, there\r\nare formed, after some days, crystals of _Nicotianin_ or _Tobacco\r\nCamphor_. According to J. A. Barral, nicotianin contains 7·12 per cent.\r\nof nitrogen (?). By submitting 4 kilogrammes of good tobacco of the\r\nprevious year to distillation with much water, we obtained nicotianin,\r\nfloating on the surface of the distillate, in the form of minute\r\nacicular crystals, which we found to be devoid of action on polarized\r\nlight. The crystals have no peculiar taste, at least in the small\r\nquantity we tried; they have a tobacco-like smell, perhaps simply due\r\nto the water adhering to them. When an attempt was made to separate\r\nthem by a filter, they entirely disappeared, being probably dissolved\r\nby an accompanying trace of essential oil. The clear water showed an\r\nalkaline reaction partly due to _nicotine_; this was proved by adding\r\na solution of tannic acid, which caused a well-marked turbidity.\r\nNicotianine is in our opinion a fatty acid contaminated with a little\r\nvolatile oil as in the case of Capsicum (see page 454), or Iris (see\r\narticle Rhizome Iridis).\r\n\r\nAmong the ordinary constituents of leaves, tobacco contains albumin,\r\nresin and gum. In smoking, these substances, as well as the cellulose\r\nof the thick midrib, would yield products not agreeable to the\r\nconsumer. The manufacturer therefore discards the midrib, and\r\nendeavours by further preparation to ensure at least the partial\r\ndestruction of these unwelcome constituents, as well as the formation\r\nof certain products of fermentation (ferment-oils), which may perhaps\r\ncontribute to the aroma of tobacco, especially when saccharine\r\nsubstances, liquorice, or alcohol, are added in the maceration to which\r\ntobacco is subjected.\r\n\r\nTobacco leaves are remarkably rich in inorganic constituents, the\r\nproportion varying from 16 to 27 per cent. According to Boussingault,\r\nthey contain when dry about 1 per cent. of phosphoric acid, and from 3\r\nto 5 per cent. of potash, together with 2½ to 4½ per cent. of nitrogen\r\npartly in the form of nitrate, so that to enable the tobacco plant to\r\nflourish, it must have a rich soil or continual manuring.[1717]\r\n\r\n[1715] Dragendorff’s _Jahresbericht_, 1874. 98.\r\n\r\n[1716] Poggiale and Marty (1870) stated hydrocyanic acid to be absent.\r\n\r\n[1717] For further particulars on the chemistry of tobacco cultivation\r\nsee Boussingault, _Ann. de Chim. et de Phys._ ix. (1866) 50.\r\n\r\nThe lime, amounting to between a quarter and a half of the entire\r\nquantity of ash, is in the leaf combined with organic acids, especially\r\nmalic, perhaps also citric. The proportion of potash varies greatly,\r\nbut may amount to about 30 per cent. of the ash.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—There were imported into the United Kingdom in the year\r\n1872, 45,549,700 lb. of unmanufactured tobacco, rather more than half\r\nof which was derived from the United States of America. The total value\r\nof the commodity thus imported was £1,563,382; and the duty levied upon\r\nthe quantity retained for home consumption amounted to £6,694,037. In\r\n1876 the consumption of tobacco had increased to 47,000,000 lb., _i.e._\r\n1½ lb. per head of the population.\r\n\r\nIn the United States 559,049 acres of land being in 1875 under\r\ncultivation with tobacco yielded a crop of 367,000,000 lb.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Tobacco has some reputation in the removal of alvine\r\nobstructions, but it is a medicine of great potency and is very rarely\r\nused.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—Of the other species of _Nicotiana_ cultivated as\r\n_Tobacco_, _N. rustica_ L. is probably the most extensively grown. It\r\nis easily distinguished by its greenish yellow flowers, and its stalked\r\novate leaves. In spite of their coarser texture, the leaves dry more\r\neasily than those of _N. Tabacum_, and with some care may even be made\r\nto retain their green colour. _N. rustica_ furnishes _East Indian\r\nTobacco_, also the kinds known as _Latakia_ and _Turkish Tobacco_.\r\n\r\n_N. persica_ Lindl. yields the tobacco of Shiraz. _N. quadrivalvis_\r\nPursh, _N. multivalvis_ Lindl. and _N. repanda_ Willd. are also\r\ncultivated plants, the last named, a plant of Havana, being used in the\r\nmanufacture of a much valued kind of cigar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCROPHULARIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLIA DIGITALIS.\r\n\r\n_Foxglove Leaves_; F. _Feuilles de Digitale_; G. _Fingerhutblätter_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Digitalis purpurea_ L., an elegant and stately\r\nplant, common throughout the greater part of Europe, but preferring\r\nsiliceous soils and generally absent from limestone districts. It is\r\nfound on the edges of woods and thickets, on bushy ground and commons,\r\nbecoming a mountain plant in the warm parts of Europe. It occurs in the\r\nisland of Madeira, in Portugal, Central and Southern Spain, Northern\r\nItaly, France, Germany, the British Isles and Southern Sweden, and in\r\nNorway as far as 63° N. lat.; it is however very unequally distributed,\r\nand is altogether wanting in the Swiss Alps and the Jura.[1718] As a\r\ngarden plant it is well known.\r\n\r\n=History=—The Welsh “Physicians of Myddvai” appear to have frequently\r\nmade use of foxglove for the preparation of external medicines.[1719]\r\nFuchs[1720] and Tragus[1721] figured the plant; the former gave it\r\nthe name of _Digitalis_, remarking that up to the time at which he\r\nwrote, there was none for the plant in either Greek or Latin. At that\r\nperiod it was regarded as a violent medicine. Parkinson recommended\r\nit in 1640 in the “Theatrum botanicum,” and it had a place in the\r\nLondon Pharmacopœia of 1650 and in several subsequent editions. The\r\ninvestigation of its therapeutic powers (1776-9) and its introduction\r\ninto modern practice are chiefly due to Withering, a well-known English\r\nbotanist and physician.[1722]\r\n\r\n[1718] Dr. R. Cunningham found (1868) _Digitalis purpurea_ completely\r\nnaturalized about San Carlos in the Island of Chiloe in Southern Chili.\r\n\r\n[1719] _Meddygon Myddfai_ (see Appendix) in many places.\r\n\r\n[1720] _De Hist. Stirpium_, 1542. 892.\r\n\r\n[1721] _De Stirpium ... nomenclaturis_, etc. 1552—“_Campanula\r\nsylvestris seu Digitalis_.”\r\n\r\n[1722] Withering (William), _Account of the Foxglove_, Birmingham,\r\n1785. 8°.\r\n\r\nThe word _foxglove_ is said to be derived from the Anglo-Saxon\r\n_Foxes-glew_, i.e. _fox-music_, in allusion to an ancient musical\r\ninstrument consisting of bells hung on an arched support.[1723] In the\r\nScandinavian idioms the plant bears likewise the name of _foxes bell_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Foxglove is a biennial or perennial, the leaves of which\r\nought to be taken from the plant while in full flower. The lower\r\nleaves are ovate with the lamina running down into a long stalk; those\r\nof the stem become gradually narrower, passing into ovate-lanceolate\r\nwith a short broadly-winged stalk, or are sessile. All have the margin\r\ncrenate, crenate-dentate, or sub-serrate, are more or less softly\r\npubescent or nearly glabrous on the upper side, much paler and densely\r\npubescent on the under, which is marked with a prominent network of\r\nveins. The principal veins diverge at a very acute angle from the\r\nmidrib, which is thick and fleshy. The lower leaves are often a foot or\r\nmore long, by 5 to 6 inches broad; those of the stem are smaller.\r\n\r\nWhen magnified, the tip of each crenature or serrature of the leaf is\r\nseen to be provided with a small, shining, wart-like gland. The hairs\r\nof the lower surface are simple, and composed of jointed cells which\r\nflatten in drying; those of the upper surface are shorter.\r\n\r\nIn preparing foxglove for medicinal use, it is the custom of some\r\ndruggists to remove the whole of the petiole and the thicker part\r\nof the midrib, retaining only the thin lamina, which is dried with\r\na gentle heat.[1724] The fresh leaf has when bruised an unpleasant\r\nherbaceous smell, which in drying becomes agreeable and tea-like. The\r\ndried leaf has a very bitter taste.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Since the beginning of the present century,\r\nnumerous attempts have been made to prepare the active principle of\r\nfoxglove, and the name _Digitalin_ has been successively bestowed on\r\nwidely different substances.\r\n\r\nAmong the investigators engaged in these researches, we may point out\r\nWalz (1846-1858), Kosmann (1845-46, 1860), Homolle partly with Quévenne\r\n(1845-61), Nativelle (1872), and especially Schmiedeberg (1874).[1725]\r\nThe latter has prepared a new, well-defined, crystallizable principle,\r\n_Digitoxin_, from Digitalis. He exhausted with water the leaves\r\npreviously dried and powdered, and then extracted them repeatedly with\r\ndilute alcohol, 50 per cent.; the tincture thus obtained was then mixed\r\nwith basic acetate of lead as long as it produced a precipitate. The\r\nlatter being separated, the filtered liquid was concentrated and the\r\ndeposit now formed, after some days, removed from the aqueous liquid.\r\nIt was then washed with a dilute solution of carbonate of sodium, by\r\nwhich a yellow matter (_chrysophan_?) was partly removed. The substance\r\nwas then dried, and yielded to chloroform a brownish mass, which\r\nafter the chloroform had been driven off, was purified by benzin.\r\nThis liquid dissolved the remainder of the yellow or orange matter,\r\nand a little fat, leaving crude digitoxin, which is to be purified by\r\nrecrystallization from warm alcohol, 80 per cent., adding a little\r\ncharcoal. This purification still yields yellowish crystals, which\r\nought to be washed again with carbonate of sodium, ether or benzin, and\r\nthen recrystallized from warm absolute alcohol, containing a little\r\nchloroform. This process, however, will only afford colourless crystals\r\nprovided it be so performed as to cause the separation of digitoxin on\r\naccount of the cooling of the solution, not by the evaporation of the\r\nsolvent. If the liquid is instead allowed to evaporate it will soon\r\nassume a darker coloration. In the way just pointed out, perfectly\r\ncolourless scales or needle-shaped crystals of pure digitoxin are at\r\nlength formed, the yield being not more considerable than about _one_\r\npart from 10,000 of dried leaves.\r\n\r\n[1723] Prior, _Popular Names of British Plants_, ed. 2. 1870. 84.\r\n\r\n[1724] This method of preparing the leaf was directed in the London\r\nPharmacopœia of 1851, but it had long been in use. No particular\r\ndirections are given in the British Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n[1725] For further particulars on Schmiedeberg’s very elaborate\r\nresearches, the reader may consult my abstract of them in _Pharm.\r\nJourn._ v. (1875) 741.—F. A. F..\r\n\r\nDigitoxin is insoluble in water, to which it does not even impart its\r\nintensely bitter taste as displayed in the alcoholic solution. It is\r\nlikewise insoluble in benzin or bisulphide of carbon, very sparingly\r\nsoluble in ether, more abundantly so in chloroform, the latter liquid\r\nhowever acting but very slowly on digitoxin. Its best solvent is\r\nalcohol, either cold or warm. The composition of digitoxin answers to\r\nthe formula, C₃₁H₃₃O₇.\r\n\r\nDigitoxin warmed with concentrated hydrochloric acid assumes a\r\nyellow or greenish hue, the same which is commonly attributed to\r\ncommercial “digitalin.” Digitoxin is not a saccharogenous matter; in\r\nalcoholic solution it is decomposed by dilute acids, and then affords\r\n_Toxiresin_, an uncrystallizable, yellowish substance, which may easily\r\nbe separated on account of its ready solubility in ether; it appears\r\nto be produced also if digitoxin is maintained for some time in the\r\nstate of fusion at about 240° C. Toxiresin proved to be a very powerful\r\npoison, acting energetically on the heart and muscles of frogs. The\r\nvery specific action of foxglove is due—_not_ exclusively—to digitoxin;\r\nit is so highly poisonous that Schmiedeberg thinks it not at all fit\r\nfor medicinal use, which might rather be confined to other constituents\r\nof foxglove, as, for instance, to those obtained from the seeds under\r\nthe names of digitalin and digitaléin. The latter, however, are of more\r\ndifficult extraction than digitoxin.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of digitoxin is similar to that of _Nativelle’s_\r\ncrystallized “digitalin;” the former as well as paradigitogenin[1726]\r\nare largely found in Nativelle’s digitalin.\r\n\r\n[1726] A derivative of _digitoxin_ as extracted by Schmiedeberg from\r\nthe seeds of foxglove.\r\n\r\nThe _Digitalin of Nativelle_—The researches on digitalis of this\r\nchemist, for which the Orfila prize of 6000 francs was awarded in\r\n1872, have resulted in the extraction of a crystallized preparation\r\npossessing active medicinal properties. It may be obtained by the\r\nfollowing process:—\r\n\r\nThe leaves, previously exhausted by water, are extracted by means of\r\nalcohol, sp. gr. ·930. The tincture is concentrated until its weight is\r\nequal to that of the leaves used, and then diluted by adding thrice its\r\nweight of water. A pitch-like deposit is then formed; _digitaléin_ and\r\nother substances remaining in solution. The deposit dried on blotting\r\npaper is boiled with double its weight of alcohol, sp. gr. ·907; on\r\ncooling, crystals are slowly deposited during some days. They should be\r\nwashed with a little diluted alcohol (·958) and dried: to purify them,\r\nthey should be first recrystallized from chloroform, and subsequently\r\nfrom boiling alcohol sp. gr. ·828, some charcoal being used at the\r\nsame time. Digitalin is thus obtained in _colourless needle-shaped\r\ncrystals_. It assumes an intense emerald green colour when moistened\r\nwith hydrochloric acid, and has an extremely bitter taste. On the\r\nanimal economy, it displays all the peculiar effects of digitalis, the\r\ndose of a milligramme taken by an adult person once or twice a day\r\noccasioning somewhat alarming symptoms, but smaller doses exhibiting\r\nthe sedative power of the herb.\r\n\r\nAnother body occurring in foxglove is the crystallizable sugar called\r\n_Inosite_, which was detected by Marmé in the leaves, as well as\r\nin those of dandelion (p. 394). Pectic matters are also present in\r\nfoxglove leaves.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Foxglove is a very potent drug, having the effect of reducing\r\nthe frequency and force of the heart’s action, and hence is given in\r\nspecial cases as a sedative; it is also employed as a diuretic.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The dried leaves of some other plants have occasionally\r\nbeen supplied for those of foxglove. Such are the leaves of\r\n_Verbascum_, which are easily recognized by their thick coat of\r\nbranched stellate hairs; of _Inula Conyza_ DC. and _I. Helenium_ L.,\r\nwhich have the margin almost entire, and in the latter plant the veins\r\ndiverging nearly at a right angle from the midrib; in both plants the\r\nunder side of the leaf is less strongly reticulated than in foxglove.\r\nBut to avoid all chance of mistake, it is desirable that druggists\r\nshould purchase the _fresh flowering plant_, which cannot be confounded\r\nwith any other, and strip and dry the leaves for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACANTHACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBA ANDROGRAPHIDIS.\r\n\r\n_Kariyát or Creyat._\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Andrographis[1727] paniculata_ Nees ab E.\r\n(_Justicia Burm._), an annual herb, 1 to 2 feet high, common throughout\r\nIndia, growing under the shade of trees. It is found likewise in\r\nCeylon and Java, and has been introduced into the West Indies. In some\r\ndistricts of India it is cultivated.\r\n\r\n[1727] _Andrographis_ from δνὴρ and γραϕὶς, in allusion to the\r\nbrush-like anther and filament.—Fig. in Bentley and Trimen’s _Med.\r\nPlants_, part 23 (1877).\r\n\r\n=History=—It is probable that in ancient Hindu medicine this plant\r\nwas administered indiscriminately with chiretta, which, with several\r\nother species of _Ophelia_, is known in India by nearly the same\r\nvernacular names. Ainslie asserts that it was a component of a famous\r\nbitter tincture called by the Portuguese of India _Droga amara_; but\r\non consulting the authority he quotes[1728] we find that the bitter\r\nemployed in that medicine was _Calumba_. _Andrographis_ is known in\r\nBengal as _Mahā-tīta_, literally _king of bitters_, from the Sanskrit\r\ntikta, “bitter,” a title of which it has been thought so far deserving\r\nthat it has been admitted to a place in the _Pharmacopœia of India_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The straight, knotty branch stems are obtusely\r\nquadrangular, about ¼ of an inch thick at the base, of a dark green\r\ncolour and longitudinally furrowed. The leaves are opposite, petiolate,\r\nlanceolate, entire, the largest ½ an inch or more wide and 3 inches\r\nlong. Their upper surface is dark green, the under somewhat lighter,\r\nand as seen under a lens finely granular. The leaves are very thin,\r\nbrittle, and, like the stems, entirely glabrous.\r\n\r\nIn the well-dried specimen before us, for which we are indebted to\r\nDr. G. Bidie of Madras, flowers are wanting and only a few roots are\r\npresent. The latter are tapering and simple, emitting numerous thin\r\nrootlets, greyish externally, woody and whitish within. The plant is\r\ninodorous and has a persistent pure bitter taste.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The aqueous infusion of the herb exhibits a\r\nslight acid reaction, and has an intensely bitter taste, which appears\r\ndue to an indifferent, non-basic principle, for the usual reagents do\r\nnot indicate the presence of an alkaloid. Tannic acid on the other hand\r\nproduces an abundant precipitate, a compound of itself with the bitter\r\nprinciple. The infusion is but little altered by the salts of iron; it\r\ncontains a considerable quantity of chloride of sodium.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Employed as a pure bitter tonic like quassia, gentian, or\r\nchiretta, with the last of which it is sometimes confounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSESAMEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLEUM SESAMI.\r\n\r\n_Sesamé Oil_, _Gingeli_, _Gingili_ or _Jinjili Oil_, _Til_ or _Teel\r\nOil_, _Benné Oil_; F. _Huile de Sésame_; G. _Sesamöl_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Sesamum indicum_ DC., an erect, pubescent annual\r\nherb, 2 to 4 feet high,[1729] indigenous to India, but propagated by\r\ncultivation throughout the warmer regions of the globe, and not now\r\nfound anywhere in the wild state. In Europe, _Sesamum_ is only grown in\r\nsome districts of Turkey and Greece, and on a small scale in Sicily and\r\nin the islands of Malta and Gozo. It does not succeed well even in the\r\nSouth of France.\r\n\r\n[1728] Paolino da San Bartolomeo, _Voyage to the East Indies_\r\n(1776-1789), translated from the German, Lond. 1800; pp. 14. 409.\r\n\r\n[1729] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen’s _Med. Plants_, part 23 (1877).\r\n\r\n=History=—Sesamé is a plant which we find on the authority of the most\r\nancient documents of Egyptian, Hebrew,[1730] Sanskrit, Greek, and Roman\r\nliterature, has been used by mankind for the sake of its oily seeds\r\nfrom the earliest times. The Egyptian name _Semsemt_ already occurring\r\nin the Papyrus Ebers, is still existing in the Coptic _Semsem_, the\r\nArabic _Simsim_, and the modern _Sesamum_. The Indian languages have\r\ntheir own terms for it, the Hindustani _Til_, from the Sanskrit _Tila_,\r\nbeing one of the best known.[1731] _Tila_ already occurs in the Vedic\r\nliterature. In the days of Pliny the oil was an export from Sind to\r\nEurope by way of the Red Sea, precisely as the seeds are at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle ages the plant, then known as _Suseman_ or _Sempsen_,\r\nwas cultivated in Cyprus, Egypt and Sicily; the oil was an article of\r\nimport from Alexandria to Venice. Joachim Camerarius gave a good figure\r\nof the plant in his “Hortus medicus et philosophicus” 1588 (tab. 44).\r\nIn modern times sesame oil gave way to that of olives, yet at present\r\nit is an article which, if not so renowned, is at least of far greater\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\n=Production=—The plant comes to perfection within 3 or 4 months; its\r\ncapsule contains numerous flat seeds, which are about ²/₁₀10 of an\r\ninch long by ¹/₂₀ thick, and weigh on an average ¹/₁₆ of a grain. To\r\ncollect them, the plant when mature is cut down, and stacked in heaps\r\nfor a few days, after which it is exposed to the sun during the day,\r\nbut collected again into heaps at night. By this process the capsules\r\ngradually ripen and burst, and the seeds fall out.[1732]\r\n\r\nThe plant is found in several varieties affording respectively white,\r\nyellowish, reddish, brown or black seeds. The dark seeds may be\r\ndeprived of a part of their colouring matter by washing, which is\r\nsometimes done with a view to obtain a paler oil.[1733]\r\n\r\nWe obtained from yellowish seeds 56 per cent. of oil; on a large scale,\r\nthe yield varies with the variety of seed employed and the process of\r\npressing, from 45 to 50 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The best kinds of sesamé oil have a mild agreeable taste,\r\na light yellowish colour, and scarcely any odour; but in these respects\r\nthe oil is liable to vary with the circumstances already mentioned. The\r\nwhite seeds produced in Sind are reputed to yield the finest oil.\r\n\r\nWe prepared some oil by means of ether, and found it to have a sp. gr.\r\nof 0·919 at 23° C.; it solidified at 5° C., becoming rather turbid at\r\nsome degrees above this temperature. Yet sesame oil is more fluid at\r\nordinary temperatures than ground-nut oil, and is less prone to change\r\nby the influence of the air. It is in fact, when of fine quality, one\r\nof the less alterable oils.\r\n\r\n[1730] Isaiah xxviii. 27.\r\n\r\n[1731] The word _Gingeli_ (or _Gergelim_), which Roxburgh remarks was\r\n(as it is now) in common use among Europeans, derives from the Arabic\r\n_chulchulân_, denoting sesame seed in its husks before being reaped\r\n(Dr. Rice). The word _Benné_ is, we believe, of West African origin,\r\nand has no connection with _Ben_, the name of _Moringa_.\r\n\r\n[1732] For further particulars see Buchanan, _Journey from Madras\r\nthrough Mysore, etc._ i. (1807) 95. and ii. 224.\r\n\r\n[1733] This curious process is described in the _Reports of Juries_,\r\n_Madras Exhibition_, 1856, p. 31.—That the colouring matter of\r\nthe seeds is actually soluble in water is confirmed by Lépine of\r\nPondicherry as we have learnt from his manuscript notes presented to\r\nthe Musée des Produits des Colonies de France at Paris. The seeds may\r\neven be used as a dye.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The oil is a mixture of olein, stearin and other\r\ncompounds of glycerin with acids of the fatty series. We prepared with\r\nit in the usual way a lead plaster, and treated the latter with ether\r\nin order to remove the oleate of lead. The solution was then decomposed\r\nby sulphuretted hydrogen, evaporated and exposed to hyponitric vapours.\r\nBy this process we obtained 72·6 per cent. of _Elaïdic Acid_. The\r\nspecimen of sesamé oil prepared by ourselves consequently contained\r\n76·0 per cent. of olein, inasmuch as it must be supposed to be present\r\nin the form of triolein. In commercial oils the amount of olein is\r\ncertainly not constant.\r\n\r\nAs to the solid part of the oil, we succeeded in removing fatty acids,\r\nfreely melting, after repeated crystallizations, at 67° C., which may\r\nconsist of stearic acid mixed with one or more of the allied homologous\r\nacids, as palmitic and myristic. By precipitating with acetate of\r\nmagnesium, as proposed by Heintz, we finally isolated acids melting at\r\n52·5 to 53°, 62 to 63°, and 69·2° C., which correspond to myristic,\r\npalmitic and stearic acids.\r\n\r\nThe small proportion of solid matter which separates from the oil on\r\ncongelation cannot be removed by pressure, for even at many degrees\r\nbelow the freezing point it remains as a soft magma. In this respect\r\nsesamé oil differs from that of olive.\r\n\r\nSesamé oil contains an extremely small quantity of a substance, perhaps\r\nresinoid, which has not yet been isolated. It may be obtained in\r\nsolution by repeatedly shaking 5 volumes of the oil with one of glacial\r\nacetic acid. If a cold mixture of equal weights of sulphuric and\r\nnitric acids is added in like volume, the acetic solution acquires a\r\ngreenish yellow hue. The same experiment being made with spirit of wine\r\nsubstituted for acetic acid, the mixture assumes a blue colour, quickly\r\nchanging to greenish yellow. The oil itself being gently shaken with\r\nsulphuric and nitric acids, takes a fine green hue, as shown in 1852 by\r\nBehrens, who at the same time pointed out that no other oil exhibits\r\nthis reaction. It takes place even with the bleached and perfectly\r\ncolourless oil. Sesamé oil added to other oils, if to a larger extent\r\nthan 10 per cent., may be recognised by this test. The reaction ought\r\nto be observed with small quantities, say 1 gramme of the oil and 1\r\ngramme of the acid mixture, previously cooled.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The commercial importance of Sesamé may be at once\r\nillustrated by the fact that France imported in 1870, 83 millions; in\r\n1871, 57½ millions; and 1872, 50 millions of kilogrammes (984,693 cwt.)\r\nof the seed.[1734]\r\n\r\nThe quantity shipped from British India in the year 1871-72 was 565,854\r\ncwt., of which France took no less than 495,414 cwt.[1735] The imports\r\nof the seed into the United Kingdom in 1870 were to the value of only\r\nabout £13,000.\r\n\r\nSesamé is extensively produced in Corea and in the Chinese island of\r\nFormosa, which in 1869 exported the exceptionally large quantity of\r\n46,000 peculs[1736] (1 pecul = 133 lb.). Zanzibar and Mozambique also\r\nfurnish considerable quantities of sesamé, whilst on the West Coast of\r\nAfrica the staple oil-seed is Ground-nut (_Arachis hypogæa_ L. p. 186).\r\nThe chief place for the manufacture of sesamé oil is Marseilles.\r\n\r\n[1734] _Documents Statistiques réunis par l’Administration des Douanes\r\nsur le commerce de la France_, année 1872.\r\n\r\n[1735] _Statement of the Trade and Navigation of British India with\r\nForeign Countries_, Calcutta, 1872. 62.\r\n\r\n[1736] _Reports on Trade at the Treaty Ports in China for 1870_,\r\nShanghai, 1871. 81.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Good sesamé oil might be employed without disadvantage for all\r\nthe purposes for which olive oil is used.[1737] As its congealing point\r\nis some degrees below that of olive oil, it is even more fitted for\r\ncool climates. Sesamé seeds are largely consumed as food both in India\r\nand Tropical Africa. The foliage of the plant abounds in mucilage, and\r\nin the United States is sometimes used in the form of poultice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLABIATÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORES LAVANDULÆ.\r\n\r\n_Lavender Flowers_; F. _Fleurs de Lavande_; G. _Lavendelblumen_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Lavandula vera_ DC., a shrubby plant growing in\r\nthe wild state from 1 to 2 feet high, but attaining 3 feet or more\r\nunder cultivation. It is indigenous to the mountainous regions of the\r\ncountries bordering the western half of the Mediterranean basin. Thus\r\nit occurs in Eastern Spain, Southern France (extending northward to\r\nLyons and Dauphiny), in Upper Italy, Corsica, Calabria and Northern\r\nAfrica,—on the outside of the olive region.[1738] In cultivation it\r\ngrows very well in the open air throughout the greater part of Germany\r\nand as far north as Norway and Livonia; the northern plant would even\r\nappear to be more fragrant, according to Schübeler.[1739]\r\n\r\n=History=—There has been much learned investigation in order to\r\nidentify lavender in the writings of the classical authors, but the\r\nresult has not been satisfactory, and no allusion has been found which\r\nunquestionably refers either to _L. vera_ or to _L. Spica_,[1740]\r\nwhereas _L. Stœchas_ was perfectly familiar to the ancients.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of lavender that we have observed, occurs in the\r\nwritings of the abbess Hildegard,[1741] who lived near Bingen on the\r\nRhine during the 12th century, and who in a chapter _De Lavendula_\r\nalludes to the strong odour and many virtues of the plant. In a poem\r\nof the school of Salerno entitled _Flos Medicinæ_[1742] occur the\r\nfollowing lines:—\r\n\r\n    “Salvia, castoreum, _lavendula_, primula veris,\r\n     Nasturtium, athanas hæc sanant paralytica membra.”\r\n\r\nIn 1387 cushions of satin were made for King Charles VI. of France, to\r\nbe stuffed with “_lavende_.”[1743] Its use was also popular at an early\r\nperiod in the British isles, for we find “_Llafant_” or “_Llafanllys_”\r\nmentioned among the remedies of the “Physicians of Myddvai.”[1744]\r\nAnd in Walton’s “Description of an inn,” about the year 1680 to 1690,\r\nwe find the walls stuck round with ballads, where the sheets smelt of\r\n_lavender_....[1745]\r\n\r\n[1737] For pharmaceutical uses, the larger proportion of olein and\r\nconsequent lesser tendency to solidify, should be remembered.\r\n\r\n[1738] On Mont Ventoux near Avignon, the region of _Lavandula vera_ is\r\ncomprised, according to Martins, between 1500 and 4500 feet above the\r\nsea-level.—_Ann. des Sc. Nat._, Bot. x.

They are arranged\r\nin 6 to 10 whorls (verticillasters), the lowest being generally far\r\nremote from those above it. A whorl consists of two cymes, each having,\r\nwhen fully developed, about three flowers, below which is a rhomboidal\r\nacuminate bract, as well as several narrow smaller bracts belonging to\r\nthe particular flowers. The calyx is tubular, contracted towards the\r\nmouth, marked with 13 nerves and 5-toothed, the posterior tooth much\r\nlarger than the others. The corolla of a violet colour is tubular,\r\ntwo-lipped, the upper lip with two, the lower with three lobes. Both\r\ncorolla and calyx, as well as the leaves and stalks, are clothed with\r\na dense tomentum of stellate hairs, amongst which minute shining\r\noil-glands can be seen by the aid of a lens.\r\n\r\nThe flowers emit when rubbed a delightful fragrance, and have a\r\npleasant aromatic taste. The leaves of the plant are oblong linear, or\r\nlanceolate, revolute at the margin and very hoary when young.\r\n\r\nFor pharmaceutical use or as a perfume, lavender flowers are stripped\r\nfrom the stalks and dried by a gentle heat. They are but seldom kept in\r\nthe shops, being grown almost entirely for the sake of their essential\r\noil.\r\n\r\n=Production of Essential Oil=—Lavender is cultivated in the parishes\r\nof Mitcham, Carshalton and Beddington and a few adjoining localities,\r\nall in Surrey, to the extent of about 300 acres. It is also grown at\r\nMarket Deeping in Lincolnshire; also at Hitchin in Hertfordshire, where\r\nlavender was apparently cultivated as early as the year 1568.[1746]\r\n\r\nAt the latter place there were in 1871 about 50 acres so cropped.\r\n\r\nThe plants which are of a small size, and grown in rows in dry open\r\nfields, flower in July and August. The flowers are usually cut with the\r\nstalks of full length, tied up in mats, and carried to the distillery\r\nthere to await distillation. This is performed in the same large stills\r\nthat are used for peppermint. The flowers are commonly distilled with\r\nthe stalks as gathered, and either fresh, or in a more or less dry\r\nstate. A few cultivators distill only the flowering heads, thereby\r\nobtaining a superior product. Still more rarely, the flowers are\r\nstripped from the stalks, and the latter rejected _in toto_.[1747]\r\nAccording to the careful experiments of Bell,[1748] the oil made\r\nin this last method is of exceedingly fine quality. The produce he\r\nobtained in 1846 was 26½ ounces per 100 lb. of flowers, entirely\r\nfreed from stalks; in 1847, 25½ ounces; and in 1848, 20 ounces: the\r\nquantities of flowers used in the respective years were 417, 633,\r\nand 923 lb. Oil distilled from the stalks alone was found to have a\r\npeculiar rank odour. In the distillation of lavender, it is said that\r\nthe oil which comes over in the earlier part of the operation is of\r\nsuperior flavour.\r\n\r\n[1746] Perhs, _Proc. American Pharm. Association_, 1876. 819.\r\n\r\n[1747] For more particulars see the interesting account of Holmes,\r\n_Pharm. Journ._ viii. (1877) 301. The author describes also the disease\r\nwhich is affecting the lavender since about the year 1860.\r\n\r\n[1748] _Pharm. Journ._ viii. (1849) 276.\r\n\r\nWe have no accurate data as to the produce of oil obtained in the\r\nordinary way, but it is universally stated to vary extremely with the\r\nseason. Warren[1749] gives it as 10 to 12 lb., and in an exceptional\r\ncase as much as 24 lb. from the acre of ground under cultivation. At\r\nHitchin,[1750] the yield would appear to approximate to the last named\r\nquantity. The experiments performed in Bell’s laboratory as detailed\r\nabove, show that the flowers deprived of stalks afforded on an average\r\nexactly 1½ per cent. of essential oil.\r\n\r\nOil of _Lavandula vera_ is distilled in Piedmont, and in the\r\nmountainous parts of the South of France, as in the villages about Mont\r\nVentoux near Avignon, and in those some leagues west of Montpellier\r\n(St. Guilhen-le-désert, Montarnaud and St. Jean de Fos)—in all cases\r\nfrom the wild plant. This foreign oil is offered in commerce of several\r\nqualities, the highest of which commands scarcely one-sixth the price\r\nof the oil produced at Mitcham.[1751] The cheaper sorts at least are\r\nobtained by distilling the _entire plant_.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The only constituent of lavender flowers that\r\nhas attracted the attention of chemists is the essential oil (_Oleum\r\nLavandulæ_). It is a pale yellow, mobile liquid, varying in sp. gr.\r\nfrom 0·87 to 0·94 (Zeller), having a very agreeable odour of the\r\nflowers and a strong aromatic taste. The oil distilled at Mitcham\r\n(1871) we find to rotate the plane of polarization 4·2° to the left, in\r\na column of 50 mm.\r\n\r\nOil of lavender seems to be a mixture in variable proportions of\r\noxygenated oils and stearoptene, the latter being identical, according\r\nto Dumas, with common camphor. In some samples it is said to exist to\r\nthe extent of one-half, and to be sometimes deposited from the oil in\r\ncold weather; we have not however been able to ascertain this fact.\r\nThe oil according to Lallemand (1859) appears also to contain compound\r\nethers.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Dried lavender flowers are the object of some trade in the\r\nsouth of Europe. According to the official _Tableau général du Commerce\r\nde la France_, Lavender and Orange Flowers (which are not separated)\r\nwere exported in 1870 to the extent of 110,958 kilo. (244,741\r\nlb.),—chiefly to the Barbary States, Turkey and America. There are no\r\ndata to show the amount of oil of lavender imported into England.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Lavender flowers are not prescribed in modern English medicine.\r\nThe volatile oil has the stimulant properties common to bodies of the\r\nsame class and is much used as a perfume.\r\n\r\n[1749] _Pharm. Journ._ vi. (1865) 257.\r\n\r\n[1750] _Ibid._ i. (1860) 278. The statement is that an acre of land\r\nyields “_about 6 Winchester quarts_” of oil.—One Winchester quart = 282\r\nlitres.\r\n\r\n[1751] The Mitcham oil fetches 30_s._ to 60_s._ per lb., according to\r\nthe season.\r\n\r\nOther Species of Lavender.\r\n\r\n1. _Lavandula Spica_ DC. is a plant having a very close resemblance\r\nto _L. vera_, of which Linnæus considered it a variety, though its\r\ndistinctness is now admitted. It occurs over much of the area of\r\n_L. vera_, but does not extend so far north, nor is it found in\r\nsuch elevated situations, or beyond the limit of the olive. It is in\r\nfact a more southern plant and more susceptible to cold, so that it\r\ncannot be cultivated in the open soil in Britain except in sheltered\r\npositions. In Languedoc and Provence, it is the common species from the\r\nsea-level up to about 2000 feet, where it is met by the more hardy _L.\r\nvera_.[1752]\r\n\r\n_Lavandula Spica_ is distilled in the south of France, the flowering\r\nwild plant in its entire state being used. The essential oil, which is\r\ntermed in French _Essence d’Aspic_, is known to English druggists as\r\n_Oleum Lavandulæ spicæ_, _Oleum Spicæ_, or _Oil of Spike_. It resembles\r\ntrue oil of lavender, but compared with that distilled in England it\r\nhas a much less delicate fragrance. This however may depend upon the\r\nfrequent adulteration, for we find that flowers of the two plants (_L.\r\nvera_ and _L. Spica_) grown side by side in an English garden, are\r\nhardly distinguishable in fragrance. Porta already even, in speaking\r\nof the oil of lavender flowers, stated:[1753] “e _spica fragrantior_\r\nexcipitur, ut illud quod ex Gallia provenit....”—Lallemand (1859)\r\nisolated from oil of spike a camphor which he believes to be identical\r\nwith common camphor.\r\n\r\nOil of Spike is used in porcelain painting and in veterinary medicine.\r\n\r\n2. _Lavandula Stœchas_ L.—This plant was well known to the ancients;\r\nDioscorides remarks that it gives a name to the Stœchades, the modern\r\nisles of Hières near Toulon, where the plant still abounds. It has a\r\nwider range than the two species of _Lavandula_ already described, for\r\nit is found in the Canaries and in Portugal, and eastward throughout\r\nthe Mediterranean region to Constantinople and Asia Minor. It may at\r\nonce be known from the other lavenders by its flower-spike being on a\r\n_short_ stalk, and terminating in 2 or 3 conspicuous purple bracts.\r\n\r\nThe flowers, called _Flores Stœchados_ or _Stœchas arabica_,[1754] were\r\nformerly kept in the shops, and had a place in the London Pharmacopœia\r\ndown to 1746. We are not aware that they are, or ever were distilled\r\nfor essential oil, though they are stated to be the source of _True Oil\r\nof Spike_.[1755]\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBA MENTHÆ VIRIDIS.\r\n\r\n_Spearmint._\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Mentha viridis_ L. is a fragrant perennial plant,\r\nchiefly known in Europe, Asia and North America, as the Common Mint\r\nof gardens, and only found apparently wild in countries where it has\r\nlong been cultivated. It occurs occasionally in Britain under such\r\ncircumstances.[1756]\r\n\r\n[1752] On the high land between Nice and Turbia, I have observed the\r\ntwo species growing together, and that _L. vera_ is in flower two or\r\nthree weeks earlier than _L. Spica_.—D. H.\r\n\r\n[1753] _De distillatione_, Romæ, 1608. 87.\r\n\r\n[1754] The incorrectness of the term _Arabica_ is noticed by Pomet. How\r\nit came to be applied we know not.\r\n\r\n[1755] Pereira, _Elem. of Mat. Med._ ii. (1850) 1368.—Nor do we know\r\nif _L. lanata_ Boiss., a very fragrant species closely allied to _L.\r\nSpica_ DC., and a native of Spain, is distilled in that country.\r\n\r\n[1756] Bentham, _Handbook of the British Flora_, 1858. 413.—Parkinson\r\n(1640) remarks of _Speare Mint_ that it is “onely found planted in\r\ngardens with us.”\r\n\r\n_Mentha viridis_ is regarded by Bentham as not improbably a variety\r\nof _M. silvestris_ L., perpetuated through its ready propagation\r\nby suckers. J. G. Baker remarks, that while these two plants are\r\nsufficiently distinct as found in England, yet continental forms occur\r\nwhich bridge over their differences.[1757]\r\n\r\n=History=—Mint is mentioned in all early mediæval lists of plants, and\r\nwas certainly cultivated in the convent gardens of the 9th century.\r\nTurner, who has been called “the father of English botany,” states in\r\nhis _Herball_[1758] that the garden mint of his time was also called\r\n“_Spere Mynte_.” We find spearmint also described by Gerarde who terms\r\nit _Mentha Romana_ vel _Sarracenica_, or _Common Garden Mint_, but his\r\nstatement that the leaves are _white_, _soft_, and _hairy_ does not\r\nwell apply to the plant as now found in cultivation.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Spearmint has a perennial rootstock which throws out\r\nlong runners. Its stem 2 to 3 feet high is erect, when luxuriant\r\nbranched below with short erecto-patent branches, firm, quadrangular,\r\nnaked or slightly hairy beneath the nodes, often brightly tinged with\r\npurple. Leaves sessile or the lower slightly stalked, lanceolate or\r\novate-lanceolate, rounded or even cordate at the base, dark green and\r\nglabrous above, paler and prominently veined with green or purple\r\nbeneath, rather thickly glandular, but either quite naked or hairy only\r\non the midrib and principal veins, the point narrowed out and acute,\r\nthe teeth sharp but neither very close nor deep, the lowest leaves\r\nmeasuring about 1 inch across by 3 or 4 inches long. Inflorescence\r\na panicled arrangement of spikes, of which the main one is 3 or 4\r\ninches long by ⅜ inch wide, the lowest whorls sometimes ½ an inch from\r\neach other and the lowest bracts leafy. Bracteoles linear-subulate,\r\nequalling or exceeding the expanded flowers, smooth or slightly\r\nciliated. Pedicels about ¾ line long, purplish glandular, but never\r\nhairy. Calyx also often purplish, the tube campanulato-cylindrical,\r\n⅜ line long, the teeth lanceolate-subulate, equalling the tube, the\r\nflower part of which is naked, but the teeth and often the upper\r\npart clothed more or less densely with erecto-patent hairs. Corolla\r\nreddish-purple, about twice as long as the calyx, naked both within and\r\nwithout. Not smooth.\r\n\r\nThe plant varies slightly in the shape of its leaves, elongation of\r\nspike and hairiness of calyx. The entire plant emits a most fragrant\r\nodour when rubbed, and has a pungent aromatic taste.\r\n\r\n=Production=—Spearmint is grown in kitchen gardens, and more largely in\r\nmarket gardens. A few acres are under cultivation with it at Mitcham,\r\nchiefly for the sake of the herb, which is sold mostly in a dried state.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of spearmint is carried on in the United States in\r\nprecisely the same manner as that of peppermint, but on a much smaller\r\nscale. Mr. H. G. Hotchkiss of Lyons, Wayne County, State of New York,\r\nhas informed us that his manufacture of the essential oil amounted in\r\n1870 to 1162 lb. The plant he employs appears from the specimen with\r\nwhich he has favoured us, to be identical with the spearmint of English\r\ngardens, and is not the Curled Mint (_Mentha crispa_) of Germany.\r\n\r\n[1757] Seemann’s _Journal of Botany_, Aug. 1865. p. 239. We borrow Mr.\r\nBaker’s careful description of _Mentha viridis_.\r\n\r\n[1758] Part 2. (1568) 54.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Spearmint yields an essential oil (_Oleum\r\nMenthæ viridis_) in which reside the medicinal virtues of the plant.\r\nKane,[1759] who examined it, gives its sp. gr. as 0·914, and its\r\nboiling point as 160° C. The oil yielded him a considerable amount\r\nof stearoptene. Gladstone[1760] found spearmint oil to contain a\r\nhydrocarbon almost identical with oil of turpentine in odour and other\r\nphysical properties, mixed with an oxidized oil to which is due the\r\npeculiar smell of the plant. The latter oil boils at 225° C.; its sp.\r\ngr. is 0·951, and it was found to be isomeric with carvol, C₁₀H₁₄O.\r\nAccording to our experiments the oil, distilled from Curled Mint grown\r\nin Germany, deviates the plane of polarization 37°·4 to the left when\r\nexamined in a column of 100 millimetres. We prepared from it the\r\ncrystallized compound (C₁₀H₁₄0)₂SH₂, and isolated from it the liquid\r\nC₁₀H₁₄O, which differs from carvol (see Fructus Carui, page 306) by its\r\nlevogyrate power.[1761]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Spearmint is used in the form of essential oil and distilled\r\nwater, precisely in the same manner as peppermint In the United States\r\nthe oil is also employed by confectioners and the manufacturers of\r\nperfumed soap.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—Oil of spearmint is now rarely distilled in England, its\r\nhigh cost[1762] causing it to be nearly unsaleable. The cheaper foreign\r\noil is offered in price-currents as of two kinds, namely _American_ and\r\n_German_. Of the first we have already spoken: the second, termed in\r\nGerman _Krauseminzöl_, is the produce of _Mentha aquatica_ L. var. γ\r\n_crispa_ Bentham, a plant cultivated in Northern Germany. Its oil seems\r\nto agree with the oil of spearmint.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBA MENTHÆ PIPERITÆ.\r\n\r\n_Peppermint_; F. _Menthe poivrée_; G. _Pfefferminze_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Mentha piperita_ Hudson (non Linn.), an erect\r\nusually glabrous perennial, much resembling the Common Spearmint of the\r\ngardens, but differing from it in having the leaves all stalked, the\r\nflowers larger, the upper whorls of flowers somewhat crowded together,\r\nand the lower separate. In the opinion of Bentham it is possibly a mere\r\nvariety of _M. hirsuta_ L., with which it can be connected by numerous\r\nintermediate forms.\r\n\r\nPeppermint rapidly propagates itself by runners, and is now found in\r\nwet places in several parts of England, as well as on the Continent. It\r\nis cultivated on the large scale in England, France, Germany, and North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n=History=—_Mentha piperita_ was first observed in Hertfordshire by\r\nDr. Eales, and communicated to Ray, who in the second edition of his\r\n_Synopsis Stirpium Britannicarum_, 1696, noticed it under the name\r\nof _Mentha spicis brevioribus et habitioribus, foliis Menthæ fuscæ,\r\nsapore fervido piperis_; and in his _Historia Plantarum_[1763] as\r\n“_Mentha palustris_ ... _Peper-Mint_.”[1764] Dale, who found the plant\r\nin the adjoining county of Essex, states[1765] that it is esteemed a\r\nspecific in renal and vesical calculus; and Ray, in the third edition\r\nof his _Synopsis_, declares it superior to all other mints as a remedy\r\nfor weakness of the stomach and for diarrhœa. Peppermint was admitted\r\nto the London Pharmacopœia in 1721, under the designation of _Mentha\r\npiperitis sapore_.\r\n\r\n[1759] _Philosophical Magazine_, xiii.

H.\r\n\r\n[1765] _Pharmacologiæ Supplementum_, Lond. 1705. 117.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of peppermint at Mitcham in Surrey dates from about\r\n1750,[1766] at which period only a few acres of ground were there\r\ndevoted to medicinal plants. At the end of the last century, above 100\r\nacres were cropped with peppermint. But so late as 1805 there were no\r\nstills at Mitcham, and the herb had to be carried to London for the\r\nextraction of the oil. Of late years the cultivation has diminished in\r\nextent, by reason of the increased value of land and the competition of\r\nforeign oil of peppermint.\r\n\r\nOn the Continent Mentha Piperitis was grown as early as 1771 at\r\nUtrecht; Gaubius[1767] appears to have been the first to notice\r\n“_Camphora Europæa Menthæ Piperitidis_,” i.e. Menthol (see page 483).\r\n\r\nIn Germany peppermint became practically known in the latter half of\r\nthe last century, especially through the recommendation of Knigge.[1768]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The rootstock of peppermint is perennial, throwing out\r\nrunners. The stem is erect, 3 to 4 feet high, when luxuriant somewhat\r\nbranched below with erecto-patent branches, firm, quadrangular,\r\nslightly hairy, often tinged with purple. Leaves all stalked, the\r\nstalks of the lower ½ to ¾ of an inch long, naked or nearly so, the\r\nleaf lanceolate, narrowed or rather rounded towards the base, the\r\npoint narrowed out and acute, the lowest 2 to 3 inches long by about\r\n¾ of an inch broad, naked and dull green above, paler and glandular\r\nall over, but only slightly hairy upon the veins beneath; the teeth\r\nsharp, fine, and erecto-patent. Inflorescence in a loose lanceolate\r\nor acutely conical spike, 2 to 3 inches long by about ¾ of an inch\r\nbroad at the base, the lowest whorls separate, and usually the lowest\r\nbracts leaf-like. Bracteoles lanceolate-acuminate, about equalling\r\nthe expanded flowers, slightly ciliated. Pedicels 1 to 1½ lines long,\r\npurplish, glandular but not hairy. Calyx often purplish, the tube about\r\n1 line long and the teeth ½ a line, the tube campanulate-cylindrical,\r\npurplish, not hairy, but dotted over with prominent glands; the teeth\r\nlanceolate subulate, furnished with short erecto-patent hairs. Corolla\r\nreddish-purple about twice as long as the calyx, naked both within and\r\nwithout. Nut smooth[1769] (_rugose_, according to our observation). The\r\nodour and taste are strongly aromatic.\r\n\r\nIn var. 2. _vulgaris_ of Sole, _M. piperita_ β. Smith, the plant is\r\nmore hairy, with the spikes broader and shorter, or even bluntly\r\ncapitate. colourless, pale yellow, or greenish liquid, of sp. gr.\r\nvarying from 0·84 to 0·92. We learn from information kindly supplied\r\nby Messrs. Schimmel and Co., Leipzig, that the best peppermint grown\r\nin Germany, carefully dried, affords from 1 to 1·25 per cent. of oil.\r\nIt has a strong and agreeable odour, with a powerful aromatic taste,\r\nfollowed by a sensation of cold when air is drawn into the mouth. We\r\nfind that the Mitcham oil examined by polarized light in a column 50\r\nmm. long, deviates from 14°·2 to 10°·7 to the left, American oil 4°·3.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The constituent for the sake of which peppermint\r\nis cultivated is the essential oil, _Oleum Menthæ piperitæ_, a\r\ncoloureless, pale yellow or greenish liquid, of sp. gr. varying from\r\n0·84 to 0·92. We learn from information kindly supplied by Messrs.\r\nSchimmel and Co., Leipzig, that the best peppermint grown in\r\nGermany, carefully dried from 1 to 1·25 per cent of oil. It has\r\na strong and agreeable odour, with a powerful aromatic taste, followed\r\nby a sensation of cold when air is drawn into the mouth. We find that\r\nthe Mitcham oil examined by polarized light in a column 50 mm. long,\r\ndeviates from 14·2° to 10·7° to the left, American oil 4·2°.\r\n\r\n[1766] Lysons, _Environs of London_, i. (1800) 254.\r\n\r\n[1767] _Adversariorum varii argumenti liber unus_, Leidae, 1771. 99.\r\n\r\n[1768] _De Menthâ Piperitide Commentatio_, Erlangæ, 1780.\r\n\r\n[1769] This description is borrowed from Mr. Baker’s paper on the\r\nEnglish Mints, referred to at page 480, note 1.\r\n\r\nWhen oil of peppermint is cooled to -4° C., it sometimes deposits\r\ncolourless hexagonal crystals of _Peppermint Camphor_, C₁₀H₁₉OH,\r\ncalled also _Menthol_. We have never observed it, nor are we aware\r\nthat menthol has been noticed in America, but it is largely afforded\r\nby eastern mints, and found in commerce under the name of _Chinese_\r\nor _Japanese Oil of Peppermint_,[1770] either liquid, and easily\r\ndepositing the camphor, or also forming a crystalline mass impregnated\r\nwith the liquid oil.\r\n\r\nPure menthol has the exquisite odour and taste of peppermint; it\r\nforms hexagonal crystals, melting at 42° C., and boiling at 212°\r\nC. By distilling menthol with P₂O₅ it yields menthene, C₁₀H₁₈, a\r\nlevogyrate liquid, boiling at 163°, the peculiar odour of which reminds\r\nof peppermint.[1771] The Chinese crystallized oil of peppermint has\r\nsometimes a bitterish after-taste and an odour similar to that of\r\nspearmint, but by recrystallization it assumes the pure flavour.\r\n\r\nThe liquid part of the oil of peppermint has not yet been thoroughly\r\ninvestigated; it appears to consist chiefly of the compound C₁₀H₁₈O.\r\nUpon the liquid portions depend the remarkable colorations which the\r\noil of peppermint is capable of assuming. If 50 to 70 drops of the\r\ncrude oil are shaken with one drop of nitric acid, sp. gr. about 1·2,\r\nthe mixture changes from faintly yellowish to brownish, and, after\r\nan hour or two, exhibits a bluish, violet or greenish colour; in\r\nreflected light, it appears reddish and not transparent. The colour\r\nthus produced lasts a fortnight. We have thus examined the various\r\nsamples of peppermint oil at our command, and may state that the finest\r\namong them assume the most beautiful coloration and fluorescence,\r\nwhich, however, shows very appreciable differences. An inferior oil\r\nof American origin was not coloured; and a very old sample of an\r\noriginally excellent English oil was likewise not coloured by the test.\r\nMenthol is not altered when similarly treated.[1772] The nitric acid\r\ntest is not capable of revealing adulterations of peppermint oil, for\r\nthe coloration takes place with an oil to which a considerable quantity\r\nof oil of turpentine has been added.\r\n\r\n[1770] The Chinese oil is distilled at Canton, and was exported from\r\nCanton in 1872 to the extent of 800 lbs.; it was valued at about 30s.\r\nper lb.—See also Flückiger in _Pharm. Journ._ Oct. 14, 1871. 321. As to\r\nJapan we are informed that there are large plantations of peppermint;\r\nthe oil “Hakano Abura” is exported from Hiogo and Osaka, but frequently\r\nadulterated. Mr. Holmes informed me (1879) that he found the mother\r\nplant coming nearest to _Mentha canadensis_.—F. A. F..\r\n\r\n[1771] On Japanese Peppermint Camphor see Beckett and Alder Wright,\r\n_Yearbook of Pharm._ 1875. 605.\r\n\r\n[1772] _Pharm. Journ._ Feb. 25, 1871. 682.\r\n\r\nRemarkable colorations of a different hue are also displayed by the\r\nvarious kinds of oil of peppermint if other chemical agents are\r\nmixed with it. Thus green or brownish tints are produced by means\r\nof _anhydrous_ chloral; the oil becomes bluish or greenish or\r\nrose-coloured if shaken with a concentrated solution of bisulphite\r\nof sodium. It is worthy of note that oils of different origin, which\r\ncannot be distinguished by means of nitric acid, exhibit totally\r\ndifferent colorations if mixed with either of the liquids just named,\r\nor with vapour of bromine. This behaviour may be of some use in the\r\nexamination of commercial sorts of peppermint oil.\r\n\r\nAs to bisulphite of sodium, it yields a solid compound with certain\r\nkinds of peppermint oil, which we have not yet examined.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—In several parts of Europe, as well as in\r\nthe United States, peppermint is cultivated on the large scale as a\r\nmedicinal plant.\r\n\r\nIn England the culture is carried on in the neighbourhood of Mitcham\r\nin Surrey, near Wisebeach in Cambridgeshire, Market Deeping in\r\nLincolnshire, and Hitchin in Hertfordshire.\r\n\r\nAt Mitcham in 1850 there were about 500 acres under cultivation; in\r\n1864 only about 219 acres.[1773] At Market Deeping there were in 1871\r\nabout 150 acres cropped with peppermint. The usual produce in oil\r\nmay be reckoned at 8 to 12 lb. per acre. The fields of peppermint\r\nat Mitcham are level, with a rich, friable soil, well manured and\r\nnaturally retentive of moisture. The ground is kept free from weeds,\r\nand in other respects is carefully tilled. The crop is cut in August,\r\nand the herb is usually allowed to dry on the ground before it is\r\nconsigned to the stills. These are of large size, holding 1000 to\r\n2000 gallons, and heated by coal; each still is furnished with a\r\ncondensing worm of the usual character, which passes out into a small\r\niron cage secured by a padlock, in which stands the oil separator. The\r\ndistillation is conducted at the lowest possible temperature. The water\r\nthat comes over with the oil is not distilled with another lot of herb,\r\nbut is for the most part allowed to run away, a very little only being\r\nreserved as a perquisite of the workmen. The produce is very variable,\r\nand no facilities exist for estimating it with accuracy.[1774] It is\r\nhowever stated that a ton of dried peppermint yields from 2½ to 3½\r\npounds of oil, which equals 0·11 to 0·15 per cent. But we have been\r\nassured by a grower at Mitcham that the yield is as much as 6 pounds\r\nfrom a ton, or 0·26 per cent.\r\n\r\nAt Mitcham and its neighbourhood two varieties of peppermint are at\r\npresent recognized, the one being known as _White Mint_, the other as\r\n_Black Mint_, but the differences between the two are very slight. The\r\nBlack Mint has _purple_ stems; the White Mint, _green_ stems, and as\r\nwe have observed, leaves rather more coarsely serrated than those of\r\nthe Black. The Black Mint is more prolific in essential oil than the\r\nWhite, and hence more generally cultivated; but the oil of the latter\r\nis superior in delicacy of odour and commands a higher price. White\r\nMint is said to be principally grown for drying in bundles, or as it is\r\ntermed “_bunching_.”\r\n\r\n[1773] _Pharm. Journ._ x. (1851) 297. 340; also Warren in _Pharm.\r\nJourn._ vi. (1865) 257. To these papers and to personal inquiries we\r\nare indebted for most of the particulars relating to peppermint culture\r\nat Mitcham.\r\n\r\n[1774] Only the larger growers have stills. These they let to smaller\r\ncultivators who pay so much for distilling a charge, _i.e._ whatever\r\nthe still can be made to contain, without reference to weight. Hence\r\nthe dried herb is preferred to the fresh, as a larger quantity can be\r\ndistilled at one time.\r\n\r\nPeppermint is grown on a vastly larger scale in America, the localities\r\nwhere the cultivation is carried on being Southern Michigan, Western\r\nNew York, and Ohio. In Michigan where the plant was introduced in\r\n1855, there were in 1858 about 2100 acres devoted to its growth, all\r\nwith the exception of about 100 acres being in the county of St.\r\nJoseph, where there are about 100 distilleries. The average produce\r\nof this district was estimated in 1858 at 15,000 lb.; but the yield\r\nfluctuates enormously, and in the exceptionally fine season of 1855 it\r\nwas reckoned at 30,000 lb. We must suppose that it is sometimes much\r\nlarger, for we have been informed by Mr. H. G. Hotchkiss, of Lyons,\r\nWayne County, State of New York, one of the most well-known dealers, in\r\na letter under date Oct. 10, 1871, that the quantity sent out by him\r\nin the previous year reached the enormous amount of 57,365 lb. It is\r\nfurther stated by the official statistics of Hamburg for the year 1876\r\nthat this port received 25,840 lb. of peppermint oil from the United\r\nStates and 14,890 lb. from Great Britain.\r\n\r\nFrom the statistics quoted by Stearns[1775] it would appear that the\r\nproduce of oil per acre is somewhat higher in America than in England,\r\nbut from various causes information on this head cannot be very\r\nreliable.\r\n\r\nPeppermint is cultivated at Sens in the department of the Yonne in\r\nFrance[1776] and in Germany in the environs of Leipzig, where the\r\nlittle town of Cölleda produces annually as much as 40,000 cwts. of the\r\nherb.\r\n\r\nThe annual crop of the world is supposed to yield 90,000 lb. of\r\npeppermint oil.[1777]\r\n\r\nPeppermint oil varies greatly in commercial value, that of Mitcham\r\ncommanding twice or three times as high a price as the finest American.\r\nEven the oil of Mitcham is by no means uniform in quality, certain\r\nplots of ground affording a product of superior fragrance. A damp\r\nsituation or badly drained ground is well known to be unfavourable to\r\nthe quantity and quality of oil.\r\n\r\nThe presence of weeds among the peppermint is an important cause of\r\ndeterioration to the oil, and at Mitcham some growers give a gratuity\r\nto their labourers to induce them to be careful in throwing out other\r\nplants when cutting the herb for distillation. One grower of peppermint\r\nknown to us was compelled to abandon the cultivation, owing to the\r\nenormous increase of _Mentha arvensis_ L. which could not be separated,\r\nand which when distilled with the peppermint ruined the flavour of\r\nthe latter. In America great detriment is occasioned by the growth of\r\n_Erigeron canadensis_ L. Newly cleared ground planted with peppermint\r\nis liable to the intrusion of another plant of the order Compositæ,\r\n_Erechtites hieracifolia_ Raf., which is also highly injurious to the\r\nquality of the oil.[1778]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—A watery or spirituous solution of oil of peppermint is a\r\ngrateful stimulant, and is a frequent adjunct to other medicines. Oil\r\nof peppermint is extensively consumed for flavouring and cordials.\r\n\r\n[1775] To whose paper _On the Peppermint Plantations of Michigan_ in\r\nthe _Proceedings of the Americ. Pharm. Assoc._ for 1858, we owe the\r\nfew particulars for which we can here afford space.—To be farther\r\nconsulted, same _Proceedings_, 1876. 828.\r\n\r\n[1776] _Journ. de Pharm._ viii.

It\r\nhas been introduced into North[1780] and South America. For medicinal\r\nuse it is cultivated on a small scale.\r\n\r\n=History=—Pennyroyal was in high repute among the ancients. Both\r\nDioscorides and Pliny describe its numerous virtues. In Northern\r\nEurope it was also much esteemed, as may be inferred from the frequent\r\nreference to it in the Anglo-Saxon and Welsh works on medicine.\r\n\r\nGerarde considered the plant to be “so exceedingly well known to all\r\nour English nation” that it needed no description. In his time (_circa_\r\n1590), it used to be collected on the commons round London, whence\r\nit was brought in plenty to the London markets. At the present day\r\npennyroyal has fallen into neglect, and is not named in the British\r\nPharmacopœia of 1867.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The plant has a low, decumbent, branching stem, which in\r\nflowering rises to a height of about 6 inches. Its leaves, scarcely\r\nan inch in length and often much less, are petiolate, ovate, blunt,\r\ncrenate at the margin, dotted with oil-glands above and below. The\r\nflowers are arranged in a series of dense, globose whorls, extending\r\nfor a considerable distance up the stem. The whole plant is more or\r\nless hairy. It has a strong fragrant odour, less agreeable to most\r\npersons than that of peppermint or spearmint. Its taste, well perceived\r\nin the distilled water, is highly aromatic.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most important constituent of pennyroyal\r\nis the essential oil, known in pharmacy as _Oleum Pulegii_, to which\r\nis due the odour of the plant. It has been examined by Kane,[1781]\r\naccording to whom it has a sp. gr. of 0·927. Its boiling was found to\r\nfluctuate between 183° and 188° C. The formula assigned to it by this\r\nchemist is C₁₀H₁₆O. We ascertained that it contains no carvol (see page\r\n481.)\r\n\r\n=Production=—Pennyroyal is cultivated at Mitcham and is mostly sold\r\ndried; occasionally the herb is distilled for essential oil. The oil\r\nfound in commerce is however chiefly French or German, and far less\r\ncostly than that produced in England.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The distilled water of pennyroyal is carminative and\r\nantispasmodic, and is used in the same manner as peppermint water.\r\n\r\n[1779] _Pennyroyal_, in old herbals _Puloil royal_ is derived from\r\n_Puleium regium_, an old Latin name given from the supposed efficacy of\r\nthe plant in destroying fleas (Prior).\r\n\r\n[1780] The native Pennyroyal is however a different plant, namely\r\n_Hedeoma pulegioides_ Pers., figured in part 21 (1877) of Bentley and\r\nTrimen’s _Med. Plants_.\r\n\r\n[1781] _Phil. Mag._ xiii.

On Mont Ventoux near Avignon, it reaches\r\nan elevation above the sea of 3700 ft. (Martins). It is commonly\r\ncultivated in English kitchens as a sweet herb,[1782] and succeeds as\r\nan annual even in Iceland.\r\n\r\n=History=—We are not aware that thyme had any reputation in the\r\nantiquity, nor do we know at what period it was first introduced in\r\nnorthern countries. Garden thyme was commonly cultivated in England in\r\nthe 16th century, and was well figured and described by Gerarde. It is\r\neven said to have been formerly grown on a large scale for medicinal\r\nuse in the neighbourhood of Deal and Sandwich in Kent.[1783] _Camphor\r\nof Thyme_ was noticed by Neumann, apothecary to the Court at Berlin in\r\n1725;[1784] it was called _Thymol_, and carefully examined in 1853 by\r\nLallemand, and recommended instead of phenol (carbolic acid) in 1868 by\r\nBouilhon, apothecary, and Paquet, M. D. of Lille.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The plant produces thin, woody, branching stems, bearing\r\nsessile, linear-lanceolate, or ovate-lanceolate leaves. These are\r\nabout ¼ of an inch long, revolute at the margin, more or less hoary,\r\nespecially on the under side, and dotted with shining oil-glands. The\r\nsmall purple flowers are borne on round terminal heads, with sometimes\r\na few lower whorls. The entire wild plant has a greyish tint by reason\r\nof a short white pubescence, yet as seen in gardens the plant is more\r\nluxuriant, greener and far less tomentose. It is extremely fragrant\r\nwhen rubbed, and has a pungent aromatic taste.\r\n\r\n=Production of Essential Oil=—Though cultivated in gardens for culinary\r\nuse, common thyme is not grown in England on a large scale. Its\r\nessential oil (_Oleum Thymi_), for which alone it is of interest to the\r\ndruggist, is distilled in the south of France. In the neighbourhood\r\nof Nîmes, where we have observed the process, the entire plant is\r\nused, and the distillation is carried on at two periods of the year,\r\nnamely in May and June when the plant is in flower, and again late\r\nin the autumn. The oil has a deep, reddish-brown colour, but becomes\r\ncolourless though rather less fragrant by re-distillation. The two\r\nsorts of oil, termed respectively _Huile rouge de Thym_ and _Huile\r\nblanche de Thym_, are found in commerce. The yield is about 1 per cent.\r\n\r\nOil of thyme is frequently termed in English shops _Oil of Origanum_,\r\nwhich it in no respect resembles, and which was never, so far as we\r\nknow, found in commerce.[1785]\r\n\r\n[1782] In many of the references to thyme, _Wild Thyme_ (_Thymus\r\nSerpyllum_ L.) is to be understood, and not the present species.\r\n\r\n[1783] Booth in _Treasury of Botany_, ii. (1866) 1149.\r\n\r\n[1784] _Phil. Trans._ No. 389.\r\n\r\n[1785] For a note on _True Oil of Origanum_, see Hanbury, _Pharm.\r\nJourn._ x. (1851) 324, also _Science Papers_, 1876, p. 46.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The only constituent of the herb that has\r\nattracted any attention is the above-named essential oil. This\r\nliquid by fractional distillation is resolved into two portions: the\r\nfirst, more volatile and boiling below 180° C., is a mixture of two\r\nhydrocarbons, _Cymene_, C₁₀H₁₄ (see page 333), and _Thymene_, C₁₀H₁₆,\r\nthe latter boiling at 165° C.\r\n\r\nThe second, named _Thymol_, C₁₀H₁₄O, which may also be extracted from\r\nthe crude oil by means of caustic lye, has been described in our\r\narticle _Fructus Ajowan_, at page 303. Commercial oil of thyme is said\r\nto be sometimes fraudulently deprived of thymol by that treatment.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Oil of thyme is an efficient external stimulant, and is\r\nsometimes employed as a liniment. Its chief consumption is in\r\nveterinary medicine. Thymol has been proposed as a disinfectant in the\r\nplace of carbolic acid, in cases in which the odour of the latter is\r\nobjectionable. The herb is not used in modern English medicine, but is\r\noften employed on the Continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBA ROSMARINI.\r\n\r\n_Herba Anthos_; _Rosemary_; F. _Romarin_; G. _Rosmarin_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Rosmarinus officinalis_ L., an evergreen shrub,\r\nattaining a height of 4 feet or more, abundant on dry rocky hills of\r\nthe Mediterranean region, from the Spanish peninsula[1786] to Greece\r\nand Asia Minor. It generally prefers the neighbourhood of the sea,\r\nbut occurs even in the Sahara, where it is collected and conveyed by\r\ncaravans to Central Africa.[1787] It does not succeed well in Germany.\r\n\r\n=History=—Rosemary[1788] is mentioned by Pliny, who ascribes to it\r\nnumerous virtues. It was also familiar to the Arab physicians of Spain,\r\none of whom, Ibn Baytar (13th cent.), states it to be an object of\r\ntrade among the vendors of aromatics.[1789] In the middle ages rosemary\r\nwas doubtless much esteemed, as may be inferred from the fact that it\r\nwas one of the plants which Charlemagne ordered to be grown on the\r\nimperial farms.\r\n\r\nIt was probably in cultivation in Britain prior to the Norman Conquest,\r\nas it is recommended for use in an Anglo-Saxon herbal of the 11th\r\ncentury.[1790] In the “Physicians of Myddvai” a curious chapter[1791]\r\nis devoted to the virtues of Rosemary, called “Ysbwynwydd, and Rosa\r\nMarina in Latin.” The essential oil was distilled by Raymundus\r\nLullus[1792] about A.D. 1330. John Philip de Lignamine,[1793] a writer\r\nof the 15th century, describes Rosemary as the usual condiment of\r\nsalted meats.\r\n\r\n[1786] From Galicia in Spain, stems of Rosmarinus having 2½ inches in\r\ndiameter were to be seen at the Paris Exhibition, 1878.\r\n\r\n[1787] Duveyrier, _Les Touaregs du Nord_, 1864. 187.\r\n\r\n[1788] From _ros_ and _marinus_,—literally _marine dew_.

These glands are of\r\ntwo kinds, large and small, and probably do not yield one and the same\r\noil. The flowers have a campanulate 2-lipped calyx, and a pale blue\r\nand white corolla, the upper lip of which is emarginate and erect,\r\nthe lower 3-lobed with the central lobe concave and pendulous. The\r\nwhole plant has a very agreeable smell and a strong aromatic taste. It\r\nflowers in the early spring.\r\n\r\n=Production of Essential Oil=—Rosemary is cultivated on a very\r\nsmall scale in English herb-gardens, and though a little oil has\r\nbeen occasionally distilled from it, English oil of rosemary is an\r\narticle practically unknown in commerce. That with which the market\r\nis supplied is produced in the south of France and on the contiguous\r\ncoasts of Italy. The plant, which is plentifully found wild, is\r\ngathered in summer (not while in flower) and distilled, the operator\r\nbeing sometimes an itinerant herbalist who carries his copper alembic\r\nfrom place to place, erecting it where herbs are plentiful, and\r\nwhere a stream of water enables him to cool a condenser of primitive\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nOil of rosemary is also produced on a somewhat large scale in the\r\nisland of Lesina, south of Spalato in Dalmatia, whence it is exported\r\nby way of Trieste, even to France and Italy, to the extent of 300 to\r\n350 quintals annually.[1794]\r\n\r\nSome of the French manufacturers of essences offer oil of rosemary at\r\na superior price as drawn _from the flowers_, by which we presume is\r\nmeant the _flowering tops_, for the separation of the actual flowers\r\nwould be impracticable on a large scale. The great bulk of the oil\r\nfound in commerce is however that distilled from the entire plant.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The peculiar odour of rosemary depends on the\r\nessential oil, which is the only constituent of the plant that has\r\nafforded matter for chemical research.\r\n\r\nLallemand (1859) by fractional distillation, resolved oil of rosemary\r\ninto two liquids,—the one a mobile hydrocarbon boiling at 165° C. and\r\nturning the plane of polarization to the left; the other, boiling\r\nbetween 200° and 210° C., deposits when exposed to a low temperature a\r\nlarge quantity of camphor. Gladstone (1864) found the oil to consist\r\nalmost wholly of a hydrocarbon, C₁₀H₁₆. This, according to our\r\nexperiments, constitutes about ⁴/₅ of the oil; it deviates the plane of\r\npolarization to the left, whereas a fraction boiling at 200° to 210°\r\nC. deviates to the right. By warming the latter with nitric acid, we\r\nobserved the odour of common camphor, and may therefore infer that a\r\ncompound, C₁₀H₁₈O, is present in the oil under examination.\r\n\r\nFrom Montgolfier’s investigations (1876) it would appear that the\r\nstearoptene or camphor above alluded to is a mixture of a dextrogyrate\r\nand a lævogyrate substance.\r\n\r\n[1794] Unger, _Der Rosmarin und seine Verwendung in\r\nDalmatien—Sitzungsberichte der Wiener Akademie_, lvi.

The volatile oil is employed as\r\nan external stimulant in liniments, and also as a perfume. Rosemary is\r\npopularly supposed to promote the growth of the hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTAGINEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEN ISPAGHULÆ.\r\n\r\n_Ispaghúl Seeds_, _Spogel Seeds_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Plantago decumbens_ Forsk. (_P. Ispaghula_\r\nRoxb.),[1795] a plant of variable aspect, from an inch to a foot in\r\nheight, erect or decumbent, with linear lanceolate leaves which may be\r\nnearly glabrous, or covered with shaggy hairs. The flower-spikes differ\r\naccording to the luxuriance of the plant, being in some specimens\r\ncylindrical and 1½ inches long, in others reduced to a globular\r\nhead. The plant has a wide range, occurring in the Canary Islands,\r\nEgypt, Arabia, Beluchistan, Afghanistan, and North-western India.\r\nStewart[1796] says it is common in the Peshawar valley and Trans-Indus\r\ngenerally up to 2000 feet; also on the plains and lower hills of the\r\nPunjab, but that he has never seen it cultivated in the latter region.\r\nIt is said to be cultivated at Multan and Lahore, also in Bengal and\r\nMysore.\r\n\r\n=History=—The seeds which are found in all the bazaars of India and\r\nare held in great esteem, are generally designated by the Persian word\r\n_Ispaghúl_; but they also bear the Arabic name _Bazre-qatúná_, under\r\nwhich we find them mentioned by the Persian physician Alhervi[1797]\r\nin the 10th century, and about the same period or a little later by\r\nAvicenna.[1798] Several other Oriental writers are quoted by Ibn\r\nBaytar[1799] as referring to a drug of the same name, which may\r\npossibly have included the seeds of other species, as _Plantago\r\nPsyllium_ L. and _P. Cynops_, having similar properties, and known to\r\nhave been used from an early period.\r\n\r\nJ. H. Linck, whom we mentioned in our article on Oleum Cajuputi (p.\r\n278), described in 1719 the seed under notice, yet without knowing its\r\nname; it further attracted the notice of Europeans towards the close of\r\nthe last century,[1800] and has been often prescribed as a demulcent in\r\ndysentery and diarrhœa. It was admitted to the _Pharmacopœia of India_\r\nof 1868.\r\n\r\n[1795] After the examination of numerous specimens, we adopt the\r\ncourse taken by Dr. Aitchison (_Catalogue of the Plants of the Punjab\r\nand Sindh_, Lond. 1869) of uniting _P. Ispaghula_ to _P. decumbens_.\r\nThe union of species in this group may probably be carried still\r\nfurther.—For a fig. see Bentley and Trimen, _Med.

Plants and Drugs_, Calcutta,\r\n1810. 31.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The seeds, like those of other species of _Plantago_, are\r\nof boat-shaped form, the albumen being deeply furrowed on one side and\r\nvaulted on the other. They are a little over ⅒ of an inch in length\r\nand nearly half as broad, and so light that 100 weigh scarcely three\r\ngrains. Their colour is a light pinkish grey with an elongated brown\r\nspot on the vaulted back, due to the embryo, which at this point is\r\nin close contact with the translucent testa. From this brown spot the\r\nthick radicle runs to the top of the seed. The hollow side of the seed\r\nis also brown and partially covered with a thin white membrane.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are highly mucilaginous in the mouth, but have neither taste\r\nnor odour. Those of the allied _P. Psyllium_ have nearly the same form,\r\nbut are shining and of a dark brown hue.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—This can be best investigated by immersing\r\nthe seed in benzol, as in this medium the mucilage is insoluble. When\r\nthus examined, the whole surface is seen to consist of polyhedral\r\ncells, separated by a very thin brown layer from the albumen, which\r\non the back of the seed is only 70 mkm. thick. The albumen is made up\r\nof thick-walled cells, loaded with granules of matter which acquire\r\nan orange hue on addition of iodine. The two cotyledons adhere in a\r\ndirection perpendicular to the bottom of the furrow; their tissue is\r\ncomposed of thin-walled smaller cells, containing also albuminous\r\ngranules and drops of fatty oil.\r\n\r\nIf the seed is immersed in water, the cells composing the epidermis\r\ninstantly swell and elongate, and soon burst, leaving only fragments of\r\ntheir walls. When examined under glycerin, the change is more gradual,\r\nand the outer walls of the cells yielding the mucilage display a series\r\nof thin layers, which slowly swell and disappear by the action of\r\nwater. The mucilage is consequently not contained within the cells, but\r\nis formed of the secondary deposits on their walls, as in linseed and\r\nquince pips.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Mucilage is so abundantly yielded by these\r\nseeds, that one part of them with 20 parts of water forms a thick\r\ntasteless jelly. On addition of a larger quantity of water and\r\nfiltering, but little mucilage passes, the greater part of it adhering\r\nto the seeds. The mucilage separated by straining with pressure does\r\nnot redden litmus, is not affected by iodine, nor precipitated by\r\nborax, alcohol or ferric chloride. The fat oil and albuminous matter of\r\nthe seed have not been examined.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—A decoction of the seeds (1 p. to 70 p. of water) is employed in\r\nIndia as a cooling, demulcent drink. The seeds powdered and mixed with\r\nsugar, or made gelatinous with water, are sometimes given in chronic\r\ndiarrhœa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYGONACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX RHEI.\r\n\r\n_Rhubarb_; F. _Rhubarbe_; G. _Rhabarber_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—No competent observer, as far as we know, has ever\r\nascertained as an eye-witness the species of Rheum which affords the\r\ncommercial rhubarb. Rheum officinale, from which it seems, at least\r\npartly, derived is the only species yielding a rootstock which agrees\r\nwith the drug.\r\n\r\n_Rheum officinale_ Baillon is a perennial noble plant resembling the\r\nCommon Garden Rhubarb, but of larger size. It differs from the latter\r\nin several particulars: the leaves spring from a distinct crown rising\r\nsome inches above the surface of the ground; they have a subcylindrical\r\npetiole, which as well as the veins of the under side of the lamina is\r\ncovered with a pubescence of short erect hairs. The lamina, the outline\r\nof which is orbicular, cordate at the base, is shortly 5-to 7-lobed,\r\nwith the lobes coarsely and irregularly dentate; it attains 4 to 4½\r\nfeet in length and rather more in breadth. The first leaves in spring\r\ndisplay before expanding the peculiar metallic red hue of copper.\r\n\r\nThe plant was discovered in South-eastern Tibet, where it is said to be\r\noften cultivated for the sake of its medicinal root; but it is supposed\r\nto grow in various parts of Western and North-western China, whence\r\nthe supplies of rhubarb are derived. It was obtained by the French\r\nmissionaries about the year 1867 for Dabry, French Consul at Hankow,\r\nwho transmitted specimens to Dr. Soubeiran of Paris. From one of these\r\nwhich flowered at Montmorency in 1871, a botanical description was\r\ndrawn up by Baillon.[1801]\r\n\r\nTo what extent the rhubarb of commerce is derived from this plant is\r\nnot known. But that the latter may be a true source of the drug is\r\nsupported by the fact, that there is at least no important discrepancy\r\nbetween it and the accounts and figures, scanty and imperfect though\r\nthey are, given by Chinese authors and the old Jesuit missionaries; and\r\nstill more by the agreement in structure which exists between its root\r\nand the Asiatic rhubarb of commerce.\r\n\r\nWe have engaged in 1873 Mr. Rufus Usher at Bodicott (see below, p. 500)\r\nto cultivate Rheum officinale, which is there admirably succeeding;\r\nbut it must be granted that as yet the root, notwithstanding the most\r\ncareful preparation in drying it, is far from displaying the rich\r\nyellow of the commercial drug. It is most obviously marked on the other\r\nhand with the characteristic ring of stellate markings, which we have\r\nconstantly observed in many roots of Rheum officinale cultivated by us\r\nat Clapham Common near London, as well as at Strassburg or, by other\r\nobservers, at Paris.\r\n\r\n_Rheum palmatum_ L., a species known as long as 1750, has always been\r\nsupposed to yield also rhubarb, and this has again been asserted by the\r\nRussian Colonel Przewalski, who observed in 1872 and 1873 that plant\r\nin the Alpine parts of Tangut round the Lake Kuku-nor, in the Chinese\r\nprovince of Kansu, in 36°-38° North Lat.—Rheum palmatum has been\r\nfrequently cultivated in Russian Asia and in many parts of Europe since\r\nthe last century, but without producing a root agreeing with Chinese\r\nrhubarb. Now, Przewalski states that from this species the drug under\r\nnotice is largely collected along the river Tetung-gol (or Datung-ho),\r\na tributary of the upper Hoang-ho, northward of the Kuku-nor. Specimens\r\nof that root were largely brought to St. Petersburg by Przewalski, but\r\nDragendorff expressly points out in his _Jahresbericht_ for 1877 (p.\r\n78) that it is _dissimilar_ to true rhubarb.\r\n\r\n[1801] _Adansonia_, x. 246; _Association Française pour l’avancement\r\nde la Science_, Comptes Rendus de la 1ʳᵉ Session, 1872. 514-529. pl.\r\nx.—The figure which is reproduced in Lanessan’s French translation of\r\nthe _Pharmacographia_, ii. (Paris, 1878) 210, gives a good idea of the\r\nhighly ornamental character of Rheum officinale.\r\n\r\n=History=[1802]—The Chinese appear to have been acquainted with the\r\nproperties of rhubarb from a period long anterior to the Christian\r\nera, for the drug is treated of in the herbal called _Pen-king_,\r\nwhich is attributed to the Emperor Shen-nung, the father of Chinese\r\nagriculture and medicine, who reigned about 2700 B.C. The drug is named\r\nthere _Huang-liang_, yellow, excellent, and _Ta-huang_, the great\r\nyellow.[1803] The latter name also occurs in the great Geography of\r\nChina, where it is stated that rhubarb was a tribute of the province\r\nSi-ning-fu, eastward of Lake Kuku-nor,[1804] from about the 7th to the\r\n10th centuries of our era.\r\n\r\nAs regards Western Asia and Europe, we find a root called ῤᾶ or ῤῆον,\r\nmentioned by Dioscorides as brought from beyond the Bosphorus. The same\r\ndrug is alluded to in the fourth century by Ammianus Marcellinus,[1805]\r\nwho states that it takes its name from the river Rha (the modern\r\nVolga), on whose banks it grows. Pliny describes a root termed\r\n_Rhacoma_, which when pounded yielded a colour like that of wine but\r\ninclining to saffron, and was brought from beyond Pontus.\r\n\r\nThe drug thus described is usually regarded as rhubarb, or at least\r\nas the root of some species of _Rheum_, but whether produced in the\r\nregions of the Euxine (Pontus), or merely received thence from remoter\r\ncountries, is a question that cannot be solved.\r\n\r\nIt is however certain that the name _Radix pontica_ or _Rha ponticum_,\r\nused by Scribonius Largus[1806] and Celsus,[1807] was applied in\r\nallusion to the region whence the drug was received. Lassen has shown\r\nthat trading caravans from Shensi in Northern China arrived at Bokhara\r\nas early as the year 114 B.C. Goods thus transported might reach Europe\r\neither by way of the Black Sea, or by conveyance down the Indus to\r\nthe ancient port of Barbarike. Vincent suggests[1808] that the _rha_\r\nimported by the first route would naturally be termed _rha-ponticum_,\r\nwhile that brought by the second might be called _rha-barbarum_.\r\n\r\nWe are not prepared to accept this plausible hypothesis. It receives no\r\nsupport from the author of the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea (_circa_\r\nA.D. 64), whose list of the exports of Barbarike[1809] does not include\r\nrhubarb; nor is rhubarb named among the articles on which duty was\r\nlevied at the Roman custom-house of Alexandria (A.D. 176-180).[1810]\r\n\r\nThe terms _Rheum barbarum_ vel _barbaricum_ or _Reu barbarum_ occur in\r\nthe writings of Alexander Trallianus[1811] about the middle of the 6th\r\ncentury, and in those of Benedictus Crispus,[1812] archbishop of Milan,\r\nand Isidore[1813] of Seville, who both flourished in the 7th century.\r\nAmong the Arabian writers on medicine, the younger Mesue, in the early\r\npart of the 11th century, mentions the rhubarb of China as superior to\r\nthe _Barbaric_ or Turkish.[1814] Constantinus Africanus[1815] about the\r\nsame period speaks of Indian and Pontic _Rheum_, the former of which he\r\ndeclares to be preferable. In 1154 the celebrated Arabian geographer\r\nEdrisi[1816] mentions rhubarb as a product of China, growing in the\r\nmountains of Buthink—probably the environs of north-eastern Tibet near\r\nLake Tengri Nor (or Bathang in Western Szechuen?).\r\n\r\n[1802] For further particulars see Flückiger, _Pharm.

(Paris, 1836) 494.\r\n\r\nRhubarb in the 12th century was probably imported from India, as we\r\nmay infer from the tariff of duties levied at the port of Acon in\r\nSyria, in which document[1817] it is enumerated along with many Indian\r\ndrugs. A similar list of A.D. 1271, relating to Barcelona, mentions\r\n_Ruibarbo_.[1818] In a statute of the city of Pisa called the _Breve\r\nFundacariorum_, dating 1305, rhubarb (_ribarbari_) is classified with\r\ncommodities of the Levant and India.[1819]\r\n\r\nThe first and almost the only European who has visited the\r\nrhubarb-yielding countries of China is the famous Venetian traveller,\r\nMarco Polo,[1820] who speaking of the province of Tangut says—“ ... et\r\npar toutes les montagnes de ces provinces se treuve le _reobarbe_ en\r\ngrant habondance. Et illec l’achatent les marchans et le portent par le\r\nmonde.”\r\n\r\nA sketch of the history of rhubarb would be incomplete without some\r\nreference to the various routes by which the drug has been conveyed\r\nto Europe from the western provinces of the Chinese Empire, and which\r\nhave given rise to the familiar designations of _Russian_, _Turkey_ and\r\n_China Rhubarb_.[1821]\r\n\r\n[1817] _Assises de Jérusalem_ contained in the _Recueil des Historiens\r\ndes Croisades_, _Lois_, ii.

F.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ route is that over the barren steppes of Central Asia by\r\nYarkand, Kashgar, Turkestan, and the Caspian to Russia; the _second_\r\nby the Indus or the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea and Alexandria, or by\r\nPersia to Syria and Asia Minor; and the _third_ by way of Canton, the\r\nonly port of the Chinese Empire which, previous to the year 1842, held\r\ndirect communication with Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 1653 China first permitted Russia to trade on her actual frontiers.\r\nThe traffic in Chinese goods was thereupon diverted from the line of\r\nthe Caspian and Black Sea further north, taking its way from Tangut\r\nacross the steppes of the high Gobi, and through Siberia by Tobolsk to\r\nMoscow. Thus it is mentioned in 1719 that Urga on the north edge of\r\nthe Gobi desert was the principal depôt for rhubarb. From the earliest\r\ntimes, Bucharian merchants appear to have been agents on this traffic,\r\nthe producers of the drug never concerning themselves about its export.\r\n\r\nConsequent on the rectification of frontier in 1728, a line of\r\ncustom-houses was established by treaty between Russia and China,\r\nwhereby the commerce, previously unrestricted, was limited to the\r\ngovernment caravans which passed the frontier only at Kiachta and at\r\nZuruchaitu, south of Nerchinsk. The latter place always remained\r\nunimportant, while Kiachta and the opposite Chinese town of Maimatchin\r\nbecame the staple depôts of rhubarb.\r\n\r\nThe root was subjected to special control as early as 1687-1697 by\r\nthe Russian Government, who finally monopolized the trade about 1704.\r\nCaravans fitted out by the Crown alone brought the drug to Moscow,\r\nuntil 1762, when the caravan-trade was for a while thrown open. It was\r\nnot until this period that the export of rhubarb became considerable,\r\nalthough the stringent regulations, established in 1736, were still\r\nmaintained. The surveillance of rhubarb was exercised at Kiachta in a\r\nspecial court or office called the _Brake_,[1822] under instructions\r\nfrom the Russian Minister of War, by an apothecary appointed for\r\nsix years, the object being to remove from the rhubarb brought for\r\ninspection all inferior or spurious pieces, and to improve the selected\r\ndrug by trimming, paring and boring. It was then carefully dried, and\r\npacked in chests, which were sown up in linen, and rendered impervious\r\nto wet by being pitched and then covered with hide. The drug was\r\ndispatched, but only in quantities of 1000 _puds_ (40,000 lb.), once\r\na year by way of Lake Baikal and Irkutsk to Moscow, whence it was\r\ntransmitted to St. Petersburg, to be there delivered to the Crown\r\napothecaries and in part to be sold to druggists.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted for these accounts chiefly to Calau,[1823] an\r\napothecary appointed to supervise the examination of rhubarb, and who\r\nresided a long time at Kiachta. An exact account of the remarkable\r\npolicy of the Russian Government in relation to that drug was also\r\ngiven by Von Schröders[1824] in 1864.\r\n\r\nSo long as China kept all her ports closed to foreign commerce except\r\nCanton in the extreme south, a large supply of fine rhubarb found its\r\nway to Europe by way of Russia. But the unpleasant accompaniments\r\nof the Russian supervision, which was exercised with unsparing\r\nseverity,[1825] and the extreme tediousness of the land-transport, made\r\nthe Chinese very ready to accept an easier outlet for their goods.\r\nAccordingly we find that the opening of a number of ports in the north\r\nof China exerted a very depressing influence on the trade of Kiachta,\r\nwhich was augmented by the rebellion that raged in the interior of\r\nChina for some years from 1852.\r\n\r\nOn these accounts Russia in 1855 removed certain restrictions on the\r\ntrade, though without abandoning the Rhubarb Office. She withdrew in\r\n1860 the custom-house to Irkutsk, and declared Kiachta a free port,\r\nwhile by the treaty with China of November 1860, she insisted on that\r\ncountry abandoning all restrictions on trade.\r\n\r\nBut the overland rhubarb trade had already been destroyed: the Chinese,\r\ntempted by the increased demand occasioned by the new trading-ports,\r\nbecame less careful in the collection and curing of the root, while the\r\nRussians insisted with the greatest strictness on the drug being of the\r\naccustomed quality. Hence it happened that from 1860 hardly any rhubarb\r\nwas delivered at Kiachta, either for the government use or to private\r\ntraders; and in 1863 the Rhubarb Office was abolished.\r\n\r\n[1822] From the German word _Bracke_, the name applied to persons\r\nappointed for the examination of merchandize brought to the ports of\r\nthe Baltic.\r\n\r\n[1823] Gauger’s _Rep. für Pharm. und Chemie_, 1842. 452-457; _Pharm.\r\nJourn._ ii. (1843) 658.\r\n\r\n[1824] Canstatt’s _Jahresbericht_ for 1864. i. 35-42.\r\n\r\n[1825] Thus in 1860 the Russians compelled the Chinese to burn 6000 lb.\r\nof rhubarb, on the pretext that it was _too small_!\r\n\r\nThus the so-called _Russian_ or _Muscovitic_ or _Crown Rhubarb_,\r\nfamiliarly known in England as _Turkey Rhubarb_, a drug which for its\r\nuniformly good quality long enjoyed the highest reputation, has become\r\na thing of the past, which can only now be found in museum collections.\r\nIt began to appear in English commerce at the commencement of the last\r\ncentury. Alston,[1826] who lectured on botany and materia medica at\r\nEdinburgh in 1720, speaks of rhubarb as brought from Turkey and the\r\nEast Indies,—“and of late, likewise from Muscovy.”\r\n\r\nIt has been shown (p. 494) that rhubarb was shipped from Syria in\r\nthe 12th century. Vasco da Gama[1827] mentions it in 1497 among the\r\nexports of Alexandria. In fact, the drug was carried from the far\r\neast to Persia, whence it was brought by caravans to Aleppo, Tripoli,\r\nAlexandria, and even to Smyrna. From these Levant ports it reached\r\nEurope, and was distributed as _Turkey Rhubarb_; while that which was\r\nshipped direct from China, or by way of India, became known as _China_,\r\n_Canton_, or _East India Rhubarb_. The latter was already the more\r\ncommon sort in England as early as 1640.[1828]\r\n\r\nAs the rhubarb of the Levant disappeared from trade, that of Russia\r\ntook not only its place but likewise its name, until the term “_Turkey\r\nRhubarb_” came to be the accepted designation of the drug imported from\r\nRussia. This strange confusion of terms was not however prevalent on\r\nthe Continent, but was chiefly limited to British trade.\r\n\r\nThe risk and expense of the enormous land-transport over almost the\r\nwhole breadth of Asia, caused rhubarb in ancient times to be one of the\r\nvery costly drugs. Thus at Alexandria in 1497, it was valued at twelve\r\ntimes the price of benzoin. In France in 1542,[1829] it was worth\r\nten times as much as cinnamon, or more than four times the price of\r\nsaffron. At Ulm in 1596,[1830] it was more costly than opium. A German\r\nprice-list of the magistrate of Schweinfurt, of 1614, shows _Radix Rha\r\nBarbari_ to be six times as dear as fine myrrh, and more than twice\r\nthe price of opium. An official English list[1831] giving the price\r\nof drugs in 1657, quotes opium as 6_s._ per lb., scammony 12_s._, and\r\nrhubarb 16_s._\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—The districts of the Chinese Empire which\r\nproduce rhubarb extend over a vast area. They are comprised in the\r\nfour northern provinces of China Proper, known as Chihli, Shansi,\r\nShensi,[1832] and Honan; the immense north-western province of\r\nKansuh, formerly partly included in Shensi, but now extending across\r\nthe desert of Gobi and to the frontiers of Tibet; the province of\r\nTsing-hai inhabited by Mongols, which includes the great salt lake of\r\nKoko-nor and the districts of Tangut, Sifan, and Turfan; and lastly the\r\nmountains of the western province of Szechuen. The plant is found on\r\nthe pasturages of the high plateaux, growing particularly well on spots\r\nthat have been enriched by encampments.\r\n\r\n[1826] _Lectures on the Mat. Med._ i.

The root is dug up at the\r\nbeginning of autumn when the vegetation of the plant is on the decline,\r\nand the operation is probably continued for a few months, or in some\r\ndistricts for the whole winter. It is cleaned, its cortical part sliced\r\noff, and the root cut into pieces for drying. This is performed either\r\nby the aid of fire-heat, or by simple exposure to sun and air, or the\r\npieces are first partially dried on a hot stone, and then strung on a\r\ncord and suspended until the desiccation is complete.\r\n\r\nAccording to F. von Richthofen[1834] the best rhubarb is collected\r\nexclusively from plants growing wild in the high alps of western\r\nSzechuen, especially in the Bayankara range, between the sources of the\r\nHoang-ho and the rivers Ya-lung-Kiang and Min-Kiang. This variety is\r\nchiefly known under the name Shensi rhubarb, although the inhabitants\r\nof the province of Szechuen pretend the superiority of the drug of\r\ntheir own country. The important places for the commodity are Sining-fu\r\nin the province of Kansu, and Kwan-hien in Szechuen. In the plain of\r\nTshing-tu-fu, according to Richthofen, rhubarb is cultivated in fields,\r\nbut its product is stated to be much inferior to that of the true plant\r\nwhich is said not to succeed under culture.\r\n\r\nRhubarb is now purchased for the European market chiefly at Hankow on\r\nthe upper Yangtsze, whither it is brought from the provinces of Shensi,\r\nKansu, and Szechuen. From Hankow it is sent down to Shanghai, and there\r\nshipped for Europe. The exports from Hankow are stated in official\r\ndocuments[1835] to have amounted to the following numbers of peculs\r\n(one pecul = 133⅓ lb. = 60·479 kilogrammes):\r\n\r\n    1866      1867      1868      1869      1870      1871      1872\r\n    2985      3425      2866      3398      3370      3859      3167\r\n\r\nIn 1877 there were exported by way of Hankow 2096 peculs from Shensi\r\nand 3385 peculs from Szechuen.—From all the Chinese ports, 5124 peculs\r\nof rhubarb were shipped in 1874.\r\n\r\nMuch smaller quantities (554 peculs in 1872, 1055 peculs in 1874) are\r\nshipped from Tientsin; and there are occasional exportations from\r\nCanton, Amoy, Foochow, and Ningpo. The imports of rhubarb into the\r\nUnited Kingdom in 1870 amounted to 343,306 lb., the estimated value of\r\nwhich was £62,716.[1836]\r\n\r\nWe have no information about the rhubarb which is stated by\r\nBellew[1837] to grow on the hills near Kayn or Ghayn in eastern Persia\r\n(about 32½° N. lat.).\r\n\r\n[1833] Chauveau, Vicar Apostolic of Tibet (1870), and Biet, a French\r\nmissionary, both quoted by Collin in his thesis _Des Rhubarbes_, Paris,\r\n1871. 22. 24.\r\n\r\n[1834] _Petermann’s Geograph.

Thus some pieces are\r\ncylindrical or rather barrel-shaped, others conical, while a large\r\nproportion are plano-convex, and others again are of no regular shape.\r\nThese forms are not all found in the same package, the drug being\r\nusually sorted into _round_ and _flat rhubarb_. In dimensions we find 3\r\nto 4 inches the commonest length, though an occasional piece 6 inches\r\nlong or more may be met with. The width may be stated at 2 to 3 inches.\r\nThe outer surface of the root is somewhat shrivelled, often exhibiting\r\nportions of a dark bark that have not been pared away. Many pieces are\r\npierced with a hole, in which may be found the remains of a cord used\r\nto suspend the root while drying. The drug is dusted over with a bright\r\nbrownish-yellow powder, on removal of which the outer side of the root\r\nis seen to have a rusty-brown hue, or viewed with a lens to be marked\r\nby the medullary rays, which appear as an infinity of short broken\r\nlines of deep brown, traversing a white ground.\r\n\r\nThe character which most readily distinguishes the rhubarb of China is\r\nthat well-developed pieces, broken transversely, display these dark\r\nlines arranged as an internal ring of _star-like spots_. Although this\r\ncharacter is by no means obvious in every piece of Chinese rhubarb, it\r\nis of some utility from the fact that in European rhubarb, such spots\r\nare generally wholly wanting, or at most occur only sparingly and in an\r\nisolated manner.\r\n\r\nIn judging of rhubarb, great stress is laid upon the appearance of\r\nthe root when broken, and the circumstance of the fractured surface\r\npresenting no symptoms of decay, discoloration, or sponginess.[1839]\r\nIn good rhubarb, the interior is found to be compact, and beautifully\r\nveined with reddish-brown and white, sometimes not unmixed with\r\niron-grey. The root when chewed tastes gritty, by reason of the\r\ncrystals it contains of oxalate of calcium; but it is besides bitter,\r\nastringent and nauseous. The odour is peculiar, and except by the\r\ndruggist, is mostly regarded as very disagreeable.\r\n\r\n_Microscopic Structure_—The tissue of rhubarb is made up of a white\r\nparenchyme, brown medullary rays and a few irregularly scattered very\r\nlarge fibro-vascular bundles, which are devoid of ligneous cells.\r\n\r\nOn a transverse fracture of specimens, which are not too much peeled,\r\na narrow dark cambial zone may be distinguished. In that part of the\r\nroot, only the medullary rays display the usual radial arrangement, and\r\nin the interior of the root no regular structure is met with. There\r\nis no well-marked pith, but the central portion of the tissue shows a\r\nmixture of white parenchyme and brown medullary rays running in every\r\ndirection. In full-grown roots, the central part is separated from the\r\ncambial zone by the band of stellate patches[1840] already mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1838] It is now often trimmed by wholesale druggists to simulate the\r\nold Russian rhubarb.\r\n\r\n[1839] The quality and appearance of rhubarb are far more regarded in\r\nEngland than on the Continent. To ensure a fine powder of brilliant\r\nhue, the drug is most carefully prepared, each root being split open,\r\nand any dark or decayed portion removed with a chisel or file, while\r\nthe operator is not allowed to handle the drug except with leather\r\ngloves.\r\n\r\n[1840] Their formation has been investigated by Schmitz, Proceedings of\r\nthe “_Naturforschende Gesellschaft zu Halle_”; the author also shows\r\nthat the drug is chiefly afforded by the rhizome.—An abstract of the\r\npaper will be found in Just’s _Botanischer Jahresbericht_, 1874. 461.\r\n\r\nAs to the contents of the white cells, they are loaded either with\r\nstarch or tufted crystals of oxalate of calcium, the amount of the\r\nlatter being especially liable to variation. Scheele, after having\r\ndiscovered the oxalic acid, pointed out in 1784 that the crystals under\r\nnotice consist of that acid in combination with lime; he was the first\r\nto point out the true composition of those crystals which are of so\r\nwide a distribution throughout the vegetable kingdom. The medullary\r\nrays contain the substances peculiar to rhubarb, but none of them occur\r\nin a crystalline state.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The active constituent of the root has long\r\nbeen supposed to reside in the yellowish-red contents of the medullary\r\nrays. Schrader as early as 1807 prepared a _Rhubarb-Bitter_, to which\r\nhe attributed the medicinal powers of the drug. Since then several\r\nsubstances of the same kind have been separated by various methods,\r\nand described under different names: such are the _Rhabarberstoff_ of\r\nTrommsdorff, the _Rheumin_ of Hornemann, the _Rhabarberin_ of Buchner\r\nand Herberger, the _Rhubarb-Yellow_ or _Rheïn_, and the _Rhabarbaric\r\nAcid_ of Brandes.\r\n\r\nSchlossberger and Döpping in 1844 first recognized among the\r\nabove-named substances a definite chemical body named _Chrysophan_ or\r\n_Chrysophanic Acid_,\r\n\r\n          {CH₃ }\r\n    C₁₄H₅ {   }O₂,\r\n          {(OH)₂}\r\n\r\nwhich had been found in 1843 by Rochleder and Heldt in the yellow\r\nlichen, _Parmelia parietina_. It partly forms the yellow contents of\r\nthe medullary rays of rhubarb, and when isolated crystallizes in golden\r\nyellow needles or in plates. It dissolves in ether, alcohol, or benzol;\r\nthough scarcely soluble in water, it is nevertheless extracted from\r\nthe root to some extent by that solvent, probably by reason of some\r\naccompanying substance. Alkalis dissolve it, forming fine dark red\r\nsolutions. Chrysophan, C₁₅H₁₀O₄, is a derivative of anthracene, C₁₄H₁₀,\r\nand closely allied to alizarin, C₁₄H₈O₄.\r\n\r\nBy precipitating alcoholic solutions of extract of rhubarb with ether,\r\nSchlossberger and Döpping obtained, together with chrysophan, resinous\r\nbodies which they named _Aporetin_, _Phæoretin_ and _Erythroretin_.\r\n\r\nDe la Rue and Müller (1857) extracted from rhubarb, in addition to\r\nchrysophan, an allied substance, _Emodin_, which crystallizes in\r\norange-coloured prisms, sometimes as much as two inches long. Its\r\nconstitution was subsequently found to agree with the formula\r\n\r\n          {CH₃  }\r\n    C₁₄H₄ {     }O₂.\r\n          {(OH)₃}\r\n\r\nKubly (1867) has obtained from rhubarb the following constituents:—\r\n\r\n1. _Rheo-tannic Acid_, C₂₆H₂₆O₁₄, a yellowish powder abundantly present\r\nin rhubarb, soluble in water or alcohol, not in ether. Its solutions\r\nproduce blackish-green precipitates with persalts of iron, and greyish\r\nones slowly turning blue, with protosalts of the same.\r\n\r\n2. _Rheumic Acid_ (_Rheumsäure_), C₂₀H₁₆O₉, obtained as a reddish-brown\r\npowder, by boiling rheo-tannic acid with a dilute mineral acid, a\r\nfermentable sugar being developed at the same time. Rheumic acid\r\nexhibits nearly the same reactions as rheo-tannic acid, but is very\r\nsparingly soluble in cold water. It partly pre-exists in rhubarb.\r\n\r\n3. Neutral _colourless_ substance, sparingly soluble in hot water, and\r\nseparating from the latter in prismatic _crystals_ of the formula\r\nC₁₀H₁₂O₄; no name has yet been given to it. A “white crystalline resin”\r\n(and a dark brown crystalline resin) has been isolated in 1878 by\r\nDragendorff.\r\n\r\n4. _Phæoretin_, C₁₆H₁₆O₇, agreeing with the substance thus named by\r\nSchlossberger and Döpping. It is a brown powder, soluble in alcohol or\r\nin acetic acid, but not in ether, chloroform or water.\r\n\r\n5. _Chrysophan_, described above.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dragendorff (1878) _mucilaginous matters_ occur in the\r\ndifferent varieties of rhubarb to the amount of from 11 to 17 per\r\ncent. He states them to consist of mucilage (properly so called),\r\narabic acid, metarabic acid and pararabin, and moreover enumerates also\r\npectose among the constituents of the drug.\r\n\r\nSmall quantities of albuminoid substances, malic acid, fat and sugar\r\nhave also been met with in rhubarb. As to its mineral constituents,\r\ntheir amount is exceedingly variable. Two samples of good China Rhubarb\r\ndried at 100° C. and incinerated, yielded us respectively 12·9 and\r\n13·87 per cent. of ash. Another sample, which we had particularly\r\nselected on account of its pale tint, afforded no less than 43·27 per\r\ncent. of ash. The ash consists of carbonates of calcium and potassium.\r\nEnglish rhubarb from Banbury (portions of a large specimen) left after\r\nincineration 10·90 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\nFrom a practical point of view the chemical history of rhubarb is far\r\nfrom satisfactory, for we are still ignorant to what principle the drug\r\nowes its therapeutic value, or what are the pharmaceutical preparations\r\nin which the active matter may be most appropriately exhibited.\r\nChrysophan is said to act as a purgative, but less powerfully than\r\nrhubarb itself.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Rhubarb is one of the commonest and most valuable purgatives; it\r\nis also taken as a stomachic and tonic.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—These are found in the roots of the various species of\r\n_Rheum_ cultivated in Europe. In most countries, the cultivation of\r\nrhubarb for medicinal use has at some time been attempted. Yet in but\r\nfew instances has it been persistently carried on; and though the drug\r\nproduced has often been of good appearance, it has failed to gain\r\nthe confidence of medical men, and to acquire much importance in the\r\ndrug-market. The European rhubarb most interesting from our point of\r\nview is\r\n\r\n_English Rhubarb_—So early as 1535, Andrew Boorde, an English\r\nCarthusian monk and practitioner of medicine, obtained seeds of\r\nrhubarb, which he sent as “_a grett tresure_” to Sir Thomas Cromwell,\r\nSecretary of State to Henry VIII.; but as he says they “_come\r\nowtt of barbary_” we must be allowed to hold their genuineness as\r\ndoubtful.[1841]\r\n\r\nIn the following century, namely about the year 1608, Prosper Alpinus\r\nof Padua cultivated as the True Rhubarb a plant which is now known as\r\n_Rheum Rhaponticum_ L., a native of Southern Siberia and the regions\r\nof the Volga.[1842] From this stock, Sir Matthew Lister, physician\r\nto Charles I., procured seeds when in Italy, and gave them to\r\nParkinson,[1843] who raised plants from them.\r\n\r\n[1841] Boorde’s _Introduction and Dyetary_, reprinted by the Early\r\nEnglish Text Society, 1870. 56.\r\n\r\n[1842] Prosper Alpinus, _De Rhapontico_, Lugd. Bat. 1718.\r\n\r\n[1843] _Theatrum Botanicum_, 1640. 157.\r\n\r\nCollinson obtained rhubarb plants from seeds procured in Tartary, and\r\nsent to him in 1742 by Professor Siegesbeck of St. Petersburg.[1844]\r\n\r\nAbout 1777 Hayward, an apothecary of Banbury in Oxfordshire, commenced\r\nthe cultivation of rhubarb with plants of _Rh. Rhaponticum_, raised\r\nfrom seeds sent from Russia in 1762. The drug he produced was so good\r\nthat the Society of Arts awarded him in 1789 a silver medal, and in\r\n1794 a gold medal.[1845] The Society also awarded medals about the same\r\ntime (1789-1793) to growers of rhubarb in Somersetshire, Yorkshire, and\r\nMiddlesex, some of whom, it appears, cultivated _Rh. palmatum_. On the\r\ndeath of Hayward in 1811, his rhubarb plants came into the possession\r\nof Mr. P. Usher, by whose descendants, Mr. R. Usher and sons, they are\r\nstill cultivated at Bodicott, a village near Banbury.\r\n\r\nThe authors of this book had the pleasure of inspecting the rhubarb\r\nfields of Messrs. Usher on Sept. 4, 1872, and of seeing the whole\r\nprocess of preparing the root for the market.[1846] The land under\r\ncultivation is about 17 acres, the soil being a rich friable loam.\r\nThe roots are taken from the ground during the autumn up to the month\r\nof November. It is considered advantageous that they should be 6 or\r\n7 years old, but they are seldom allowed to attain more than 3 or 4\r\nyears. The clumps of root as removed from the field to the yard, where\r\nthe trimming takes place, are of huge size, weighing with the earth\r\nattached to them as much as 60 or 70 lb. They are partially cleaned,\r\nthe smaller roots are cut off, and the large central portion is rapidly\r\ntrimmed into a short, cylindrical mass the size of a child’s head.\r\nThis latter subsequently undergoes a still further paring, and is\r\nfinally sliced longitudinally; the other and less valuable roots are\r\nalso pared, trimmed, and assorted according to size. The fresh roots\r\nare fleshy, easily cut, and of a beautiful deep yellow. All are dried\r\nin buildings constructed for the purpose, and heated by flues. The\r\ndrying occupies several weeks. The root after drying has a shrivelled,\r\nunsightly appearance, which may be remedied by paring and filing. The\r\nfinished drug has to be stored in a warm dry place.\r\n\r\nWhen well prepared, Banbury rhubarb is of excellent appearance. The\r\nfinest pieces, which are semi-cylindrical, are quite equal in size to\r\nthe drug of China. The colour is as good, and the fractured surface\r\nexhibits pink markings not less distinct and brilliant. Even the\r\nsmaller roots, which are dried as sticks, have internally a good\r\ncolour, and afford a fine powder. But the odour is somewhat different\r\nfrom that of Chinese rhubarb; the taste is less bitter but more\r\nmucilaginous and astringent, and the root is of a more spongy, soft,\r\nand brittle texture. The structure is the same as that of the Chinese\r\nrhubarb, except that, as already stated, the star-like spots, if\r\npresent, are isolated, and not arranged in a regular zone.\r\n\r\nThe drug commands but a low price, and is chiefly sold, it is said,\r\nfor exportation in the state of powder. It is not easily purchased in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n[1844] Dillwyn, _Hortus Collinsonianus_, 1843. 45.\r\n\r\n[1845] _Trans. of Soc. of Arts_, viii. (1790) 75; xii.

(1877) 1017.\r\n\r\n_French and German Rhubarb_—The cultivation of rhubarb was commenced\r\nin France in the latter half of the last century, and has been pursued\r\nwith some enthusiasm in various localities. The species grown were\r\n_Rheum palmatum_ L., _Rh. undulatum_ L., _Rh. compactum_ L., and _Rh.\r\nRhaponticum_ L. The first was thought by Guibourt[1847] to afford a\r\nroot more nearly approaching than any other the rhubarb of China; but\r\nit is that which is cultivated the least readily, the central root\r\nbeing liable to premature decay. Both this plant and _Rh. undulatum_\r\nwere formerly cultivated by order of the Russian Government on a large\r\nscale at Kolywan and Krasnojarsk in Southern Siberia, but the culture\r\nhas, we believe, been long abandoned.[1848]\r\n\r\nAs to France, it appears from inquiries we have lately made (1873),\r\nthat except in the neighbourhood of Avignon and in a few other\r\nscattered localities, the cultivation has now ceased.\r\n\r\n_Rheum Rhaponticum_ is the source of the rhubarb which is produced\r\nat Austerlitz and Auspitz in Moravia, and at Ilmitz, Kremnitz and\r\nFrauenkirchen in Hungary. Some rhubarb is also produced in Silesia from\r\n_Rh. Emodi_ Wall. (_Rh. australe_ Don.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMYRISTICEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYRISTICA.\r\n\r\n_Nuclei Myristicæ_, _Semen Myristicæ_, _Nux moschata_; _Nutmeg_; F.\r\n_Muscade_, _Noix de Muscade_; G. _Muskatnuss_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Myristica fragrans_ Houttuyn (_M. moschata_ Thunb.,\r\n_M. officinalis_ Linn. f.), a handsome, bushy, evergreen tree,[1849]\r\nwith dark shining leaves, growing in its native islands to a height of\r\n40 to 50 feet. It is found wild in the very small volcanic group of\r\nBanda, from Damma to Amboina, in Ceram, Bouro, Jilolo (Halmahera), the\r\nwestern peninsula of New Guinea, and in many of the adjacent islands,\r\nbut it is not indigenous to any of the islands westward of these, or to\r\nthe Philippines (Crawfurd).\r\n\r\nThe nutmeg tree has been introduced into Bencoolen on the west coast of\r\nSumatra, Malacca, Bengal, the islands of Singapore and Penang, as well\r\nas Brazil and the West Indies; but it is only in a very few localities\r\nthat the cultivation has been attended with success.\r\n\r\nIn its native countries the tree comes into bearing in its ninth\r\nyear, and is said to continue fruitful until 60 or even 80 years old,\r\nyielding annually as many as 2000 fruits. It is diœcious, and one male\r\ntree furnishes pollen sufficient for twenty female.\r\n\r\n=History=—It has been generally believed that neither the nutmeg nor\r\nmace was known to the ancients. C. F. Ph. von Martius[1850] however\r\nmaintains that mace was alluded to in the comedies of Plautus,[1851]\r\nwritten about two centuries before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[1847] _Histoire des Drogues_, ii. (1849) 398.\r\n\r\n[1848] Twelve chests of this rhubarb, said to be of the crop of 1793,\r\nwhich had been lying in the Russian Government warehouses, were offered\r\nfor sale in London, Dec. 1, 1853. Samples of the drug now 80 years old\r\nare in our possession, and still sound and good.\r\n\r\n[1849] Most beautifully figured by Blume, “Rumphia” i.

(1860) 529-538.\r\n\r\n[1851] _Pseudolus_, act. iii. scena 2.\r\n\r\nThe words _Macer_, _Macar_, _Machir_ or _Macir_, occurring in the\r\nwritings of Scribonius Largus, Dioscorides, Galen, and Pliny are\r\nthought by Martius to refer in each instance to mace. But that the\r\nsubstance designated by these names was not mace, but the bark of\r\na tree growing in Malabar, was pointed out by Acosta nearly three\r\ncenturies ago, and by many subsequent writers, and, as we think, with\r\nperfect correctness.[1852]\r\n\r\nNutmegs and mace were imported from India at an early date by the\r\nArabians, and thus passed into western countries. Aëtius, who was\r\nresident at the court of Constantinople about the year 540, appears to\r\nhave been acquainted with the nutmeg, if that at least is intended by\r\nthe term _Nuces Indicæ_, prescribed together with cloves, spikenard,\r\ncostus, calamus aromaticus and snadal-wood, as an ingredient of the\r\n_Suffumigium moschatum_.[1853]\r\n\r\nMasudi,[1854] who appears to have visited India in A.D. 916-920,\r\npointed out that the nutmeg, like cloves, areca nut and snadal-wood,\r\nwas a product of the eastern islands of the Indian Archipelago. The\r\nArabian geographer Edrisi, who wrote in the middle of the 12th century,\r\nmentions both nutmegs and mace as articles of import into Aden;[1855]\r\nand again “_Nois mouscades_” are among the spices on which duty was\r\nlevied at Acre in Palestine, _circa_ A.D. 1180.[1856] About a century\r\nlater, another Arabian author, Kazwini,[1857] expressly named the\r\nMoluccas as the native country of the spices under notice.\r\n\r\nThe Sanskrit name of the nutmeg tree most commonly in use, also with\r\nSusruta, is Jātī (Dr. Rice).\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest references to the use of nutmegs in Europe occurs\r\nin a poem written about 1195, by Petrus D’Ebulo,[1858] describing the\r\nentry into Rome of the Emperor Henry VI., prior to his coronation in\r\nApril 1191. On this occasion the streets were fumigated with aromatics,\r\nwhich are enumerated in the following line:—\r\n\r\n“Balsama, thus, aloë, _myristica_, cynnama, nardus.”\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 12th century, both nutmegs and mace were found in\r\nNorthern Europe,—even in Denmark, as may be inferred from the allusion\r\nto them in the writings of Harpestreng.[1859] In England, mace, though\r\nwell known, was a very costly spice, its value between A.D. 1284\r\nand 1377 being about 4_s._ 7_d._ per lb., while the average price\r\nof a sheep during the same period was but 1_s._ 5_d._, and of a cow\r\n9_s._ 5_d._[1860] It was also dear in France, for in the _Compte de\r\nl’exécution_ of the will of Jeanne d’Evreux, queen of France, in 1372,\r\nsix ounces of mace are appraised per ounce at 3 sols 8 deniers, equal\r\nto about 8_s._ 3_d._ of our present money.[1861]\r\n\r\n[1852] Mérat et De Lens, _Dict. de Mat.

The Portuguese held the trade of the Spice Islands for about\r\na century, when it was wrested from them by the Dutch, who pursued\r\nthe same policy of exclusiveness that they had followed in the case\r\nof cloves and cinnamon. In order to secure their monopoly, they\r\nendeavoured to limit the trees to Banda and Amboyna, and to exterminate\r\nthem elsewhere, which in fact they did at Ceram and the small\r\nneighbouring islands of Kelang and Nila. So completely was the spice\r\ntrade in their hands, that the crops of sixteen years were said to be\r\nat one time in their warehouses, those of recent years being never\r\nthrown on the market. Thus the crop of 1744 was being sold in 1760,\r\nin which year an immense quantity of nutmegs and cloves was burned at\r\nAmsterdam lest the price should fall too low.[1862]\r\n\r\nDuring the occupation of the Spice Islands by the English from 1796\r\nto 1802, the culture of the nutmeg was introduced into Bencoolen and\r\nPenang,[1863] and many years afterwards into Singapore. Extensive\r\nplantations of nutmeg-trees were formed in the two islands last named,\r\nand by a laborious and costly system of cultivation were for many\r\nyears highly productive.[1864] In 1860 the trees were visited by a\r\ndestructive blight, which the cultivators were powerless to arrest,\r\nand which ultimately led to the ruin of the plantations, so that in\r\n1867 there was no such thing as nutmeg cultivation either in Penang or\r\nSingapore.[1865]\r\n\r\nThough so long valued in Europe and Asia, neither nutmegs nor mace seem\r\nto have been employed in former times as a condiment in the islands\r\nwhere they are indigenous.[1866]\r\n\r\n=Collection and Preparation=—Almost the whole surface of the Banda\r\nIsles, observes Mr. Wallace,[1867] is planted with nutmeg-trees, which\r\nthrive under the shade of the lofty _Canarium commune_. The light\r\nvolcanic soil, the shade, and the excessive moisture of these islands,\r\nwhere it rains more or less every month in the year, seem exactly\r\nto suit the nutmeg tree, which requires no manure and scarcely any\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIn Bencoolen[1868] the trees bear all the year round, but the chief\r\nharvest takes place in the later months of the year, and a smaller one\r\nin April, May and June. The fruit as it splits is gathered by means of\r\na hook attached to a long stick, the pericarp removed, and the mace\r\ncarefully stripped off. The nuts are then taken to the drying house\r\n(a brick building), placed on frames, and exposed to the gentle heat\r\nof a smouldering fire, with arrangements for a proper circulation of\r\nair. This drying operation lasts for two months, during which time\r\nthe nutmegs are turned every second or third day. At the end of this\r\nperiod, the kernels are found to rattle in the shell, an indication\r\nthat the drying is complete. The shells are then broken with a wooden\r\nmallet, the nutmegs picked out and sorted, and finally rubbed over with\r\ndry sifted lime. In Banda the smaller and less sightly nutmegs are\r\nreserved for the preparation of the expressed oil.\r\n\r\n[1862] Valmont de Bomare, _Dict. d’Histoire Nat._ iv. (1775) 297.—This\r\nauthor writes as an eye-witness of the destruction he has recorded:—“Le\r\n10 Juin 1760, j’en ai vu à Amsterdam, près de l’Amirauté, un feu dont\r\nl’aliment étoit estimé huit millions argent de France: on devoit en\r\nbrûler autant le lendemain. Les pieds des spectateurs baignoient dans\r\nl’huile essentielle de ces substances....”\r\n\r\n[1863] How tempting the cultivation must have appeared, may be judged\r\nfrom the price of mace, which we find quoted on the 3rd January 1806,\r\nin the _London Price Current_ (which gives only _import prices_), as\r\n85_s._ to 90_s._ per lb.;—to these rates must be added the duty of\r\n7_s._ 1_d._ per lb.\r\n\r\n[1864] Seemann, _Hooker’s Journ. of Bot._ iv.

For further\r\ninformation on the management of nutmeg plantations in Sumatra, consult\r\nthe original paper.\r\n\r\nThe old commercial policy of the Dutch originated the singular practice\r\nof breaking the shell, and immersing the kernel of the artificially\r\ndried seed in milk of lime,—sometimes for a period of three months.\r\nThis was done with a view to render impossible the germination of\r\nany nutmegs sent into the market. The folly of such a procedure was\r\ndemonstrated by Teijsmann, who proved that mere exposure to the sun for\r\na week is sufficient to destroy the vitality of the seed. By immersion\r\nin milk of lime many nutmegs are spoiled and the necessity is incurred\r\nof a second drying. Lumsdaine has also shown that even the _dry_ liming\r\nprocess is, to say the least, entirely needless. Nutmegs are well\r\npreserved in their natural shell, in which state the Chinese have the\r\ngood sense to prefer them.\r\n\r\nThe process of liming nutmegs is however still largely followed; and\r\nthe prejudice in favour of the spice thus prepared is so strong in\r\ncertain countries, that nutmegs not limed abroad have sometimes to be\r\nlimed in London to fit them for exportation. Penang nutmegs are always\r\nimported in the natural state,—that is, _un-limed_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit of _Myristica fragrans_ is a pendulous, globose\r\ndrupe, about 2 inches in diameter, and not unlike a small round pear.\r\nIt is marked by a furrow which passes round it, and by which at\r\nmaturity its thick fleshy pericarp splits into two pieces, exhibiting\r\nin its interior a single seed, enveloped in a fleshy foliaceous mantle\r\nor arillus, of fine crimson hue, which is _mace_. The dark brown,\r\nshining, ovate seed is marked with impressions corresponding to the\r\nlobes of the arillus; and on one side, which is of paler hue and\r\nslightly flattened, a line indicating the raphe may be observed.\r\n\r\nThe bony testa does not find its way into European commerce, the\r\nso-called _nutmeg_ being merely the kernel or nucleus of the\r\nseed. Nutmegs exhibit nearly the form of their outer shell with a\r\ncorresponding diminution in size. The London dealers esteem them in\r\nproportion to their size, the largest, which are about one inch long by\r\n⁸/₁₀ of an inch broad, and four of which will weigh an ounce, fetching\r\nthe highest price. If not dressed with lime, they are of a greyish\r\nbrown, smooth yet coarsely furrowed and veined longitudinally, marked\r\non the flatter side with a shallow groove. A transverse section shows\r\nthat the inner seed-coat (_endopleura_) penetrates into the albumen\r\nin long narrow brown strips, reaching the centre of the seed, thereby\r\nimparting the peculiar marbled appearance familiar in a cut nutmeg.\r\n\r\nAt the base of the albumen and close to the hilum, is the embryo,\r\nformed of a short radicle with cup-shaped cotyledons, whose slit and\r\ncurled edges penetrate into the albumen. The tissue of the seed can be\r\ncut with equal facility in any direction. It is extremely oily, and has\r\na delicious aromatic fragrance, with a spicy rather acrid taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The testa consists mainly of long, thin,\r\nradially arranged, rigid cells, which are closely interlaced and do not\r\nexhibit any distinct cavities. The endopleura which forms the adhering\r\ncoat of the kernel and penetrates into it, consists of soft-walled,\r\nred-brown tissue, with small scattered bundles of vessels. In the\r\nouter layers the endopleura exhibits small collapsed cells; but the\r\ntissue which fills the folds that dip into the interior consists of\r\nmuch larger cells. The tissue of the albumen is formed of soft-walled\r\nparenchyme, which is densely filled with conspicuous starch-grains, and\r\nwith fat, partly crystallized. Among the prismatic crystals of fat,\r\nlarge thick rhombic or six-sided tables may often be observed. With\r\nthese are associated grains of albuminoid matter, partly crystallized.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—After starch and albuminoid matter, the\r\nprincipal constituent of nutmeg is the _fat_, which makes up about a\r\nfourth of its weight, and is known in commerce by the incorrect name of\r\n_Oil of Mace_ (see p. 507).\r\n\r\nThe volatile oil, to which the smell and taste of nutmegs are chiefly\r\ndue, amounts to between 3 and 8 per cent.,[1869] and consists,\r\naccording to Cloëz (1864), almost entirely of a hydrocarbon, C₁₀H₁₆,\r\nboiling at 165° C., which Gladstone (1872), who assigns it the same\r\ncomposition, calls _Myristicene_. The latter chemist found in the crude\r\noil an oxygenated oil, _Myristicol_, of very difficult purification\r\nand possibly subject to change during the process of rectifying. It\r\nhas a high boiling point (about 220° C.?) and the characteristic odour\r\nof nutmeg; unlike carvol with which it is isomeric, it does not form a\r\ncrystalline compound with hydrosulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nOil of nutmegs, distilled in London by Messrs. Herrings and Co.,\r\nexamined in column 200 mm. long, we found to deviate the ray of\r\npolarized light, 15°·3 to the right; that of the Long Nutmeg\r\n(_Myristica fatua_ Houtt.), furnished to us by the same firm, deviated\r\n28°·7 to the right.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts recorded by Gmelin,[1870] it would appear that oil of\r\nnutmeg sometimes deposits a stearoptene called _Myristicin_. We are\r\nnot acquainted with such a deposit; yet we have been kindly furnished\r\nby Messrs. Herrings with a crystalline substance which they obtained\r\nduring the latter part of the process of distilling both common\r\nand long nutmegs. It is a greyish greasy mass, which by repeated\r\ncrystallizations from spirit of wine, we obtained in the form of\r\nbrilliant, colourless scales, fusible at 54° C., and still possessing\r\nthe odour of nutmeg. The crystals are readily soluble in benzol,\r\nbisulphide of carbon or chloroform, sparingly in petroleum ether; their\r\nsolution in spirit of wine has a decidedly acid reaction, and is devoid\r\nof rotatory power. By boiling them with alcohol, sp. gr. 0·843, and\r\nanhydrous carbonate of sodium, we obtained a solution which, after\r\nremoval of the alcohol, left a residuum perfectly soluble in boiling\r\nwater, forming a jelly on cooling. By adding hydrochloric acid to the\r\nwarm aqueous solution, the original crystallizable substance again made\r\nits appearance, yet almost devoid of odour. It is in fact nothing else\r\nthan _Myristic Acid_ (see page 508).[1871]\r\n\r\n[1869] Messrs. Herrings & Co. of London have informed us, that 2874 lb.\r\nof nutmegs distilled in their laboratory afforded 67 lb. of essential\r\noil, _i.e._ 2·33 per cent. But Messrs. Schimmel & Co., Leipzig, state\r\n(1878) that they obtain as much as from 6 to 8 per cent.\r\n\r\n[1870] _Chemistry_, xiv. (1860) 389.\r\n\r\n[1871] _Yearbook of Pharmacy_, 1874, 490.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—The nutmegs and mace now brought into the\r\nmarket are to a large extent the produce of the Banda Islands,[1872]\r\nof which however only three, namely Lontar or the Great Banda, Pulo\r\nAi, and Pulo Nera, have what are termed _Nutmeg Parks_. According to\r\nofficial statements of the Dutch, the first-named island possessed in\r\n1864 about 266,000 fruit-bearing trees; Ternate on the western coast of\r\nJilolo, 46,000; Menado in the island of Celebes, 35,000; and Amboyna,\r\nonly 31,000. The nutmegs of the Banda Islands are shipped to Batavia.\r\nThe quantity exported from Java in 1871 (all, we believe, from Batavia,\r\nand therefore the produce of the Banda Islands) is stated as 8107\r\npeculs (1,080,933 lb.), of which 2300 peculs (306,666 lb.) were shipped\r\nto the United States, and a rather large quantity to Singapore.[1873]\r\nThe last named port also shipped in the same year a very large quantity\r\n(310,576 lb.) of nutmegs to North America,[1874] and in 1877 the total\r\nexport of nutmegs and mace from Singapore was 5323 peculs (709,733 lb.).\r\n\r\n[1872] Some idea of the extremely small area of these famous islands\r\nmay be gathered from the fact that the Great Banda, the largest of\r\nthem, is but about 7 miles long by 2 miles broad; while the entire\r\ngroup occupies no more than 17·6 geographical square miles.\r\n\r\n[1873] _Consular Reports_, Aug. 1873. 952-3. In 1875, 8990 peculs were\r\nexported from Java.\r\n\r\n[1874] _Blue Books for the Colony of the Straits Settlements for 1871_,\r\nSingapore, 1872.\r\n\r\nNutmegs were exported from Padang in Sumatra in the year 1871, to the\r\nextent of 2766 peculs (368,800 lb.), chiefly to America and Singapore.\r\nThe quantity annually imported into the United Kingdom ranges from\r\n500,000 to 800,000 lb.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Nutmeg is a grateful aromatic stimulant, chiefly employed for\r\nflavouring other medicines. It is also in constant use as a condiment,\r\nthough less appreciated than formerly.\r\n\r\n\r\nOleum Myristicæ expressum.\r\n\r\n_Oleum Macidis_, _Balsamum vel Oleum Nucistæ_; _Expressed Oil of\r\nNutmegs_, _Nutmeg Butter_, _Oil of Mace_; F. _Beurre de Muscade_; G.\r\n_Muskatbutter_, _Muskatnussöl_.\r\n\r\nThis article reaches England chiefly from Singapore, in oblong,\r\nrectangular blocks, about 10 inches long by 2½ inches square, enveloped\r\nin a wrapper of palm leaves. It is a solid unctuous substance of an\r\norange-brown colour, varying in intensity of shade, and presenting a\r\nmottled aspect. It has a very agreeable odour and a fatty aromatic\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nIn operating on 2 lb. of nutmegs, first powdered and heated in a\r\nwater-bath and pressed while still hot, we obtained 9 ounces of solid\r\noil, equivalent to 28 per cent. This oil, which in colour, odour and\r\nconsistence does not differ from that which is imported, melts at\r\nabout 45° C.; and dissolves perfectly in two parts of warm ether or in\r\nfour of warm alcohol sp. gr. ·800.\r\n\r\nNutmeg butter contains the volatile oil already described, to the\r\nextent of about six per cent., besides several fatty bodies. One of the\r\nlatter, termed _Myristin_ C₃H₅(O·C₁₄H₂₇O)₃, may be obtained by means\r\nof benzol, or by dissolving in ether that part of the butter of nutmeg\r\nwhich is insoluble in cold spirit of wine. The crystals of myristin\r\nmelt at 31° C. By saponification they furnish glycerin, and _Myristic\r\nAcid_, C₁₄H₂₈O₂, the latter fusing at 53°·8 C. Playfair in 1841 was the\r\nfirst to isolate (in Liebig’s laboratory at Giessen) myristic acid.\r\nMyristin also occurs in spermaceti, coco-nuts, as well as, according to\r\nMulder, in small quantity, in the fixed oils of linseed and poppy seed.\r\nNutmegs according to Comar (1859) yield 10 to 12 per cent. of myristin.\r\n\r\nThat part of nutmeg butter, which is more readily soluble in spirit of\r\nwine or benzol, contains another fat, which however has not yet been\r\ninvestigated. It is accompanied by a reddish colouring matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACIS.\r\n\r\n_Mace_; F. _Macis_; G. _Macis_, _Muskatblüthe_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Myristica fragrans_ Houttuyn (see p. 502). The\r\nseed which, deprived of its hard outer shell or testa, is known as\r\nthe _nutmeg_, is enclosed when fresh in a fleshy net-like envelope,\r\nsomewhat resembling the husk of a filbert. This organ, which is united,\r\nthough not very closely, at the base of the stony shell both with the\r\nhilum and the contiguous portion of the raphe, of which parts it is\r\nan expansion, is termed _arillus_,[1875] and when separated and dried\r\nconstitutes the mace of the shops. In the fresh state it is fleshy, and\r\nof a beautiful crimson; it envelopes the seed completely only at the\r\nbase, afterwards dividing itself into broad flat lobes; which branch\r\ninto narrower strips overlapping one another towards the summit.\r\n\r\n[1875] On the nature and origin of this organ, see Baillon, _Histoire\r\ndes Plantes_, ii. (1870) 499; also _Dictionnaire de Botanique_.\r\n\r\n=History=—Included in that of the nutmeg (see preceding article).\r\n\r\n=Description=—The mace, separated from the seed by hand, is dried\r\nin the sun, thereby losing its brilliant red hue and acquiring an\r\norange-brown colour. It has a dull fatty lustre, exudes oil when\r\npressed with the nail, and is horny, brittle, and translucent. Steeped\r\nin water it swells rather considerably. The entire arillus, compressed\r\nand crumpled by packing, is about 1¾ inches long with a general\r\nthickness of about ¹/₂₀ of an inch or even at ⅒ the base. Mace has\r\nan agreeable aromatic smell nearly resembling that of nutmeg, and a\r\npungent, spicy, rather acrid taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The uniform, small-celled, angular parenchyme\r\nis interrupted by numerous brown oil-cells of larger size. The inner\r\npart of the tissue contains also thin brown vascular bundles. The\r\ncells of the epidermis on either side are colourless, thick-walled,\r\nlongitudinally extended, and covered with a peculiar cuticle of\r\nbroad, flat, riband-like cells, which cannot however be removed as\r\na continuous film. The parenchyme is loaded with small granules, to\r\nwhich a red colour is imparted by Millon’s test (solution of mercurous\r\nnitrate) and an orange hue by iodine. The granules consequently consist\r\nof albuminous matter, and starch is altogether wanting.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The nature of the chemical constituents of\r\nmace may be inferred from the following experiments performed by one\r\nof us:—17 grammes of finely powdered mace were entirely exhausted by\r\nboiling ether, and the latter allowed to evaporate. It left behind\r\n5·57 grm., which after drying at 100° C. were diminished to 4·17. The\r\ndifference, 1·40 grammes, answers to the amount of _essential oil_, of\r\nwhich consequently 8·2 per cent. had been present.\r\n\r\nThe residue, amounting to 24·5 per cent., was a thickish aromatic\r\n_balsam_, in which we have not been able to ascertain the presence of\r\n_fat_; it consisted of resin and semi-resinified essential oil. Alcohol\r\nfurther removed 1·4 per cent. of an uncrystallizable sugar, which\r\nreduced cupric oxide.\r\n\r\nThe drug having been thus treated with ether and with alcohol, yielded\r\nalmost nothing to cold water, but by means of boiling water 1·8 per\r\ncent. of a mucilage was obtained, which turned blue by addition of\r\niodine, or reddish violet if previously dried. This substance is not\r\nsoluble in an ammoniacal solution of cupric oxide; it appears rather\r\nto be an intermediate body between mucilage and starch.[1876] The\r\ncomposition of mace is therefore very different from that of nutmeg.\r\n\r\nAs to the _volatile oil_, of which several observers have obtained from\r\n7 to 9 per cent.,[1877] it is a fragrant colourless liquid which we\r\nfound, when examined in a column 200 mm. long, deviated the ray 18°·8\r\nto the right. Its greater portion consists according to Schacht (1862)\r\nof _Macene_, C₁₀H₁₆, boiling at 160° C., and distinguished from oil of\r\nturpentine by not forming a crystalline hydrate when mixed with alcohol\r\nand nitric acid. Koller (1865) states that macene is identical with the\r\nhydrocarbon of oil of nutmeg (myristicene), yet the latter is said by\r\nCloëz to yield no solid compound when treated with hydrochloric gas.\r\nMacene on the other hand furnishes crystals of C₁₀H₁₆·HCl. Crude oil of\r\nmace contains, like that of nutmeg, an oxygenated oil, the properties\r\nof which have not yet been investigated.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Mace, mostly the produce as it would appear of the Banda\r\nIslands, was shipped from Java in 1871 to the extent of 2101 peculs\r\n(282,133 lb.); and from Padang in Sumatra (excluding shipments to Java)\r\nto the amount of 457 peculs (60,933 lb.).[1878] The spice is exported\r\nprincipally to Holland, Singapore, and the United States; Great Britain\r\nreceives about 60,000 to 80,000 lb. annually.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Mace is but rarely employed in medicine. It is chiefly consumed\r\nas a condiment.\r\n\r\n[1876] See my paper: _Ueber Stärke und Cellulose in Archiv der Pharm._\r\n196 (1871) 31.—F. A. F.\r\n\r\n[1877] In an actual experiment (1868) in the laboratory of Messrs.\r\nHerrings & Co., London, 23 lb. of mace yielded 23 oz. of volatile\r\noil, which is equivalent to 6¼ per cent.; but Messrs. Schimmel & Co.,\r\nLeipzig, obligingly inform us (1878) that they observed a percentage of\r\nfrom 11 to 17.\r\n\r\n[1878] _Consular Reports_, August 1873. 952-3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAURACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPHORA.\r\n\r\n_Camphor_,[1879] _Common Camphor_, _Laurel Camphor_; F. _Camphre_; G.\r\n_Campher_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Cinnamomum Camphora_ Fr.

In China it abounds principally in the\r\neastern and central provinces, as in Chekiang, Fokien and Kiangsi; but\r\nit is wanting, according to Garnier (1868), in Yünnan and Szechuen.\r\nIt is plentiful, on the other hand, in the island of Formosa, where\r\nit covers the whole line of mountains from north to south, up to an\r\nelevation of 2000 feet above the level of the sea. It flourishes in\r\ntropical and subtropical countries, and forms a large and handsome\r\ntree in sheltered spots in Italy as far north as the Lago Maggiore.\r\nThe leaves are small, shining, and glaucous beneath, and have long\r\npetioles; the stem affords excellent timber, much prized on account of\r\nits odour for making clothes’ chests and drawers of cabinets.\r\n\r\n_Dryobalanops aromatica_, the camphor tree of Borneo and Sumatra,\r\nyields a peculiar camphor, which we shall describe further on.\r\n\r\n=History=—The two kinds of Camphor afforded by the two trees just\r\nnamed have always been regarded by the Chinese as perfectly distinct\r\nsubstances, and in considering the history of camphor this fact must be\r\nborne in mind.\r\n\r\nOn perusing the accounts of Laurel Camphor given by Chinese\r\nwriters,[1880] the remarkable fact becomes apparent, that although the\r\ntree was evidently well known in the 6th century, and probably even\r\nearlier, and is specially noticed on account of its valuable timber, no\r\nmention is made in connexion with it of any such substance as _camphor_.\r\n\r\nLe-she-chin, the author of the celebrated herbal _Pun-tsao-kang-muh_,\r\nwritten in the middle of the 16th century, was well acquainted with the\r\ntwo sorts of camphor,—the one produced by the camphor laurel of his own\r\ncountry, the other imported from the Malay islands; and he narrates how\r\nthe former was prepared by boiling the wood, and refined by repeated\r\ndry sublimations.\r\n\r\nMarco Polo, towards the end of the 13th century, saw the forests of\r\nFokien in South-eastern China, in which, says he, are many of the trees\r\nwhich give camphor.[1881] It would thus appear that Laurel Camphor was\r\nknown as early as the time of Marco Polo, yet it is certain that the\r\nmore ancient notices which we shall now quote have reference to the\r\nmuch valued Malay Camphor, which remains up to the present day one of\r\nthe most precious substances of its class.\r\n\r\n[1879] The word _Camphor_, generally written by old Latin authors\r\n_Caphura_, and by English _Camphire_, is derived from the Arabic\r\n_Káfúr_, which in turn is supposed to come from the Sanskrit _Karpūra_,\r\nsignifying _white_.\r\n\r\n[1880] Passages from several have been translated and kindly placed\r\nat our disposal by Mr. A. Wylie. Dr. Bretschneider of Pekin and Mr.\r\nPauthier of Paris (see p. 494, note 7,) have also been good enough to\r\naid us in the same manner.\r\n\r\n[1881] Yule, _Book of Ser Marco Polo_, ii. (1871) 185.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that camphor reached Europe during the classical\r\nperiod of Greece and Rome. The first mention of it known to us\r\noccurs in one of the most ancient monuments of the Arabic language,\r\nthe poems of Imru-l-Kais,[1882] a prince of the Kindah dynasty, who\r\nlived in Hadramaut in the beginning of the 6th century. Nearly at\r\nthe same period, Aëtius of Amida (the modern Diarbekir) used camphor\r\nmedicinally, but from the manner in which he speaks of it, it was\r\nevidently a substance of some rarity.[1883]\r\n\r\nIn fact, for many centuries subsequent to this period, camphor was\r\nregarded as one of the most rare and precious of perfumes. Thus, it is\r\nmentioned in A.D. 636, with musk, ambergris, and snadal-wood, among the\r\ntreasures of Chosroes II., of the Sassanian dynasty of kings of Persia,\r\nin the palace at Madain on the Tigris, north of Babylon.[1884]\r\n\r\nAmong the immense mass of valuables dispersed at Cairo on the downfall\r\nof the Fatimite Khalif Mostanser in the 11th century, the Arabian\r\nhistorians[1885] enumerate with astonishment, besides vast quantities\r\nof musk, aloes wood, snadal-wood, amber, large stores of _Camphor of\r\nKaisur_, and hundreds of figures of _melons in camphor_, adorned with\r\ngold and jewels, which were contained in precious vessels of gold and\r\nporcelain. One grain (crystal?) of camphor is mentioned as weighing\r\n5 mithkals, one melon of the weight of 70 mithkals, was contained\r\nin a golden box weighing no less than 3,000 mithkals (1 mithkal =\r\n71·49 gr. Troy = 4·63 grammes). It is also on record that about A.D.\r\n642, Indian princes sent camphor as tribute or a gift to the Chinese\r\nEmperors;[1886]—further, that in the Teenpaou period (A.D. 742-755),\r\nthe Cochinchinese brought to the Chinese court a tribute of Barus\r\ncamphor, said by the envoy to be found in the trunks of old trees, the\r\nlike of which for fragrance was never seen again.[1887] Masudi,[1888]\r\nfour centuries later, mentions a similar present from an Indian to\r\na Chinese potentate, when 1,000 _menn_[1889] of aloes-wood were\r\naccompanied by 10 _menn_ of camphor, the choice quality of the latter\r\nbeing indicated by the remark that it was in pieces as large or larger\r\nthan a pistachio-nut.\r\n\r\nAgain, between A.D. 1342 and 1352, an embassy left Pekin bearing a\r\nletter from the Great Khan to Pope Benedict XII., accompanied by\r\npresents of silk, precious stones, _camphor_, musk, and spices.[1890]\r\n\r\nIbn Batuta, the celebrated traveller, relates that after having visited\r\nthe King of Sumatra, he was presented on leaving (a.d. 1347) with\r\naloes-wood, _camphor_, cloves, and sandal-wood, besides provisions.\r\n\r\n[1882] In the description of Arabia by Ibn Hagik el Hamdany, fol. 170\r\nof the MS. at Aden (Prof. Sprenger).\r\n\r\n[1883] He directs two ounces of camphor to be added to a certain\r\npreparation, provided camphor is sufficiently abundant.—Tetr. iv. sermo\r\n4. c. 114\r\n\r\n[1884] G.

This place, also called Kansúr or Kaisúr, was visited in\r\nthe 13th century by Marco Polo, who speaks of its camphor as selling\r\nfor its weight in gold; Yule[1891] believes it to be the same spot as\r\nBarus, a town on the western coast of Sumatra, still giving a name to\r\nthe camphor produced in that island.\r\n\r\nFrom all these facts and many others that might be adduced,[1892] it\r\nundoubtedly follows that the camphor first in use was that found native\r\nin the trunk of the Sumatran _Dryobalanops aromatica_, and not that of\r\nthe Camphor Laurel. At what period and at whose instigation the Chinese\r\nbegan to manufacture camphor from the latter tree is not known.\r\n\r\nCamphor was known in Europe as a medicine as early as the 12th century,\r\nas is evident from the mention of it by the abbess Hildegard[1893]\r\n(who calls it _ganphora_), Otho of Cremona,[1894] and the Danish canon\r\nHarpestreng (_ob._ A.D. 1244).\r\n\r\nGarcia de Orta states (1563) that it is the camphor of China which\r\nalone is exported to Europe, that of Borneo and Sumatra being a hundred\r\ntimes more costly, and all consumed by eastern nations. They partly\r\ndevoted the latter to ritual purposes, as for instance embalming,\r\npartly to “eating,” _i.e._ for the preparation of the betel-leaves for\r\nchewing. Neuhof[1895] states that the other ingredients used in China\r\nfor that purpose are: Areca nuts (see article Semen Arecæ) and lime\r\nor Lycium (see page 35), _Caphur de Burneo_, aloë (_i.e._ Aloë-wood,\r\nsee Aloë), and musk. Kämpfer,[1896] who resided in Japan in 1690-92,\r\nand who figured the Japanese camphor tree under the name _Laurus\r\ncamphorifera_, expressly declares the latter to be entirely different\r\nfrom the camphor tree of the Indian Archipelago. He further states\r\nthat the camphor of Borneo was among the more profitable commodities\r\nimported into Japan by the Dutch, whose homeward cargoes included\r\nJapanese camphor to the extent of 6,000 to 12,000 lb. annually.[1897]\r\nThis camphor was refined in Holland by a process long kept secret,\r\nand was then introduced into the market. In Pomet’s time (1694 and\r\nearlier), crude camphor was common in France, but it had to be sent to\r\nHolland for purification.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether at that period, or even much later, any camphor\r\nwas obtained from Formosa. Du Halde[1898] makes no allusion to it as a\r\nproduction of that island; nor does he mention it among the commodities\r\nof Emouy (Amoy), which was the Chinese port then in most active\r\ncommunication with Formosa.\r\n\r\n[1891] _The Book of Ser Marco Polo_, ii. (1874) 282, 285.\r\n\r\n[1892] For further historical details, compare my paper in the\r\n_Schweizerische Wochenschrift für Pharmacie_, 27 Sept., 4 and 11 Oct.\r\n1867, or in Buchner’s _Repertorium f.

We have no evidence that any is manufactured\r\nat the present day in China, although very large trees, often from 8 to\r\n9 feet in diameter, are common, for instance in Kiangsi, and camphor\r\nwood is an important timber of the Hankow market.\r\n\r\nIn Formosa, the camphor-producing districts lie in the narrow belt of\r\ndebateable ground, which separates the border Chinese settlements from\r\nthe territory still occupied by the aboriginal tribes. The camphor is\r\nprepared from the wood, which is cut into small chips from the trees,\r\nby means of a gouge with a long handle. In this process there is\r\ngreat waste, many trees being cut and then left with a large portion\r\nof valuable timber to perish. The next operation is to expose the\r\nwood to the vapour of boiling water, and to collect the camphor which\r\nvolatilizes with the steam. For this purpose, stills are constructed\r\nthus:—a long wooden trough, frequently a hollowed trunk, is fixed over\r\na furnace and protected by a coating of clay. Water is poured into it,\r\nand a board perforated with numerous small holes is luted over it.\r\nAbove these holes the chips are placed and covered with earthen pots.\r\nA fire having been lighted in the furnace, the water becomes heated,\r\nand the steam passing through the chips, carries with it the camphor,\r\nwhich condenses in minute white crystals in the upper part of the pots.\r\nFrom these it is scraped out every few days, and is then very pure\r\nand clean. Four stills, each having ten pots placed in a row over one\r\ntrough, are generally arranged under one shed. These stills are moved\r\nfrom time to time, according as the gradual exhaustion of timber in the\r\nlocality renders such transfer desirable. A considerable quantity of\r\ncamphor is however manufactured in the towns, the chips being conveyed\r\nthither from the country. A model of a much better still, which was\r\ncontributed from Formosa to the Paris Exhibition in 1878, is perhaps\r\nreferring to a town manufacture.\r\n\r\nCamphor is brought from the interior to Tamsui, the chief port of\r\nFormosa, the baskets holding about half a pecul each (1 pecul = 133⅓\r\nlbs.), lined and covered with large leaves. Upon arrival, it is stored\r\nin vats holding from 50 to 60 peculs each, or it is packed at once\r\nin the tubs, or lead-lined boxes, in which it is exported. From the\r\nvats or tubs there drains out a yellowish essential oil known as\r\n_Camphor Oil_, which is used by the Chinese in rheumatism.[1899] In\r\n1877 hydraulic pressure has been established for the separation of the\r\noil and moisture; the raw camphor loses about 20 per cent. of these\r\nadmixtures.\r\n\r\nKämpfer in his account[1900] of the manufacture of camphor in the\r\nJapanese province of Satzuma and in the islands of Gotho, describes\r\nthe boiling of the chips in an iron pot covered with an earthen head\r\ncontaining straw in which the camphor collects. In the province of\r\nTosa, island of Sikok, there is now a still in use, which is quite\r\nconveniently combined with a cooling apparatus consisting of a wooden\r\ntrough, over which cold water is flowing.[1901]\r\n\r\n[1899] The foregoing particulars are chiefly extracted from the _Trade\r\nReport of Tamsui_ by E. C. Taintor, Acting Commissioner of Customs,\r\npublished in the _Reports on Trade at the Treaty Ports in China_ for\r\n1869, Shanghai, 1870, and from James Morrison’s _Description of the\r\nisland of Formosa_, in the _Geogr. Magazine_, 1877, 263 and 319.\r\n\r\n[1900] _op. cit._ p. 772.\r\n\r\n[1901] Both of the above mentioned stills from Sikok and Formosa\r\nare figured in my “_Account of the Paris Exhibition_,” _Archiv der\r\nPharmacie_, 214 (1879) 12.—F. A. F..\r\n\r\n=Purification=—Camphor as it is exported from Japan and Formosa\r\nrequires to be purified by sublimation. The crude drug consists of\r\nsmall crystalline grains, which cohere into irregular friable masses,\r\nof a greyish-white or pinkish hue. Dissolved in spirit of wine, it\r\nleaves from 2 to 10 per cent. of impurities consisting of gypsum,\r\ncommon salt, sulphur, or vegetable fragments.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, crude camphor is sublimed from a little charcoal or sand,\r\niron filings or quicklime, and sent into the market as _Refined\r\nCamphor_ in the form of large bowls or concave cakes, about 10\r\ninches in diameter, 3 inches in thickness, and weighing from 9 to 12\r\nlb.[1902] Each bowl has a large round hole at the bottom, corresponding\r\nto the aperture of the vessel in which the sublimation has been\r\nconducted. This operation is performed in peculiar glass flasks termed\r\n_bomboloes_, in the upper half of which the pure camphor concretes.\r\nThese flasks having been charged and placed in a sand-bath, are rapidly\r\nheated to about 120°-190° C. in order to remove the water. Afterwards\r\nthe temperature is slowly increased to about 204° C., and maintained\r\nduring 24 hours. The flasks are finally broken.\r\n\r\nAs camphor is a neutral substance, the addition of lime probably serves\r\nmerely to retain traces of resin or empyreumatic oil. Iron would keep\r\nback sulphur were any present.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the refiners use iron vessels; their product is in\r\nflat disks, about 16 inches in diameter by one inch in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe refining of camphor is carried on to a large extent in England,\r\nHolland, Hamburg, Paris, Bohemia (Aussig), in New York and\r\nPhiladelphia. It is a process requiring great care on account of the\r\ninflammability of the product. The temperature must also be nicely\r\nregulated, so that the sublimate may be deposited not merely in loose\r\ncrystals, but in compact cakes. In India where the consumption of\r\ncamphor is very large, the natives effect the sublimation in a copper\r\nvessel, the charge of which is 1½ maunds (42 lb.): fire is applied to\r\nthe lower part, the upper being kept cool.[1903]\r\n\r\n=Description=—Purified Camphor forms a colourless crystalline,\r\ntranslucent mass, traversed by numerous fissures, so that\r\nnotwithstanding a certain toughness, a mass can readily be broken\r\nby repeated blows. By spontaneous and extremely slow evaporation at\r\nordinary temperatures, camphor sublimes in lustrous hexagonal plates or\r\nprisms, having but little hardness. If triturated in a mortar, camphor\r\nadheres to the pestle, so that it cannot be powdered _per se_. But if\r\nmoistened with spirit of wine, ether, chloroform, methylic alcohol,\r\nglycerin, or an essential or fatty oil, pulverization is effected\r\nwithout difficulty. By keeping a short time, the powder acquires a\r\ncrystalline form. With an equal weight of sugar, camphor may also be\r\neasily powdered.\r\n\r\nCamphor melts at 175° C., boils at 204°, and volatilizes somewhat\r\nrapidly even at ordinary temperatures. To this latter property,\r\ncombined with slight solubility, must be attributed the curious\r\nrotatory motion which small lumps of camphor (as well as barium\r\nbutyrate, stannic bromide, chloral hydrate, and a few other substances)\r\nexhibit when thrown on to water.\r\n\r\n[1902] These are the dimensions of the cakes manufactured in the\r\nlaboratory of Messrs. Howards of Stratford, but it is obvious that they\r\nmay vary with different makers.\r\n\r\n[1903] Mattheson, _England to Delhi_, Lond. 1870, 474.\r\n\r\nThe solubility of camphor in water is very small, 1300 parts dissolving\r\nabout one; but even this small quantity is partially separated on\r\naddition of some alkaline or earthy salt, as sulphate of magnesium.\r\nAlcohols, ethers, chloroform, carbon bisulphide, volatile and fixed\r\noils and liquid hydrocarbons, dissolve camphor abundantly.\r\n\r\nThe sp. gr. of camphor at 0° C. and up to 6° is the same as that of\r\nwater; yet at a somewhat higher temperature, camphor expands more\r\nquickly, so that at 10° to 12° C. its sp. gr. is only 0·992.\r\n\r\nIn concentrated solution or in a state of fusion, camphor turns the\r\nplane of polarization strongly to the right. Officinal solution of\r\ncamphor (_Spiritus Camphoræ_) is too weak, and does not deviate the ray\r\nof light to a considerable amount.[1904] Crystals of camphor are devoid\r\nof rotatory power.\r\n\r\nThe taste and odour of camphor are _sui generis_, or at least are\r\ncommon only to a group of nearly allied substances. Camphor is not\r\naltered by exposure to air or light. It burns easily, affording a\r\nbrilliant smoky flame.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Camphor, C₁₀H₁₆O, by treatment with various\r\nreagents, yields a number of interesting products: thus when repeatedly\r\ndistilled with chloride of zinc or anhydrous phosphoric acid, it is\r\nconverted into _Cymene_ or _Cymol_, C₁₀H₁₄, a body contained in many\r\nessential oils, or obtainable therefrom.\r\n\r\nCamphor, and also camphor oil, when subjected to powerful oxidizing\r\nagents, absorbs oxygen, passing gradually into crystallized _Camphoric\r\nAcid_, C₁₀H₁₆O₄ or C₈H₁₄(COOH)₂, water and carbonic acid being at\r\nthe same time eliminated. Many essential oils, resins and gum-resins\r\nlikewise yield these acids when similarly treated.\r\n\r\nBy means of less energetic oxidizers, camphor may be converted into\r\n_Oxy-Camphor_, C₁₀H₁₆O₂, still retaining its original odour and taste\r\n(Wheeler, 1868).\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Two kinds of crude camphor are known in the English market,\r\nnamely:\r\n\r\n1. _Formosa_ or _China Camphor_, imported in chests lined with lead or\r\ntinned iron, and weighing about 1 cwt. each; it is of a light brown,\r\nsmall in grain, and always wet, as the merchants cause water to be\r\npoured into the cases before shipment, with a view, it is pretended,\r\nof lessening the loss by evaporation. The exports of this camphor from\r\nTamsui in Formosa[1905] were in peculs (one pecul = 13·33 lb. avdp. =\r\n60·479 kilogrammes) as follows:\r\n\r\n     1870    1871    1872    1875   1876    1877\r\n    14,481   9691   10,281   7139   8794   13,178\r\n\r\nThe shipments of camphor from Takow, the other open port of Formosa,\r\nare of insignificant amount. Planks of camphor wood are now exported in\r\nsome quantity from Tamsui.\r\n\r\n2. _Japan Camphor_ is lighter in colour and occasionally of a pinkish\r\ntint; it is also in larger grains. It arrives in double tubs (one\r\nwithin the other) without metal lining, and hence is drier than the\r\nprevious sort; the tubs hold about 1 cwt. It fetches a somewhat higher\r\nprice than the Formosa camphor.\r\n\r\n[1904] _Pharm. Journ._ 18 April 1874. 830.\r\n\r\n[1905] _Returns of Trade at the Treaty Ports in China for 1872_, part.\r\n2, p. 124.\r\n\r\nHiogo and Osaka exported in 1871, 7089 peculs (945,200 lb.), and\r\nNagasaki 745 peculs (99,333 lb.), the total value being 116,718\r\ndollars.[1906] In 1877 the value of camphor exported from Japan was\r\nstated to be equal to 240,000 dollars. The imports of _Unrefined\r\nCamphor_ into the United Kingdom amounted in 1870 to 12,368 cwt.\r\n(1,385,216 lb.); of _Refined Camphor_ in the same year to 2361\r\ncwt.[1907]\r\n\r\nCamphor is largely consumed by the natives of India; the quantity\r\nof the crude drug imported into Bombay in the year 1872-73 was 3801\r\ncwt.[1908]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Camphor has stimulant properties and is frequently used in\r\nmedicine both internally and externally. It is largely consumed in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nOther kinds of Camphor; Camphor Oils.\r\n\r\nCamphor, as stated above at page 512, was the name originally applied\r\nto the product of Dryobalanops; it was then also given to that of\r\nCamphor Laurel, and in 1725 Caspar Neumann, of Berlin, first pointed\r\nout that many essential oils afford crystals (“stearoptenes” of later\r\nchemists), for which he proposed the general name of camphor. Many of\r\nthem are agreeing with the formula C₁₀H₁₆O, and there are also numerous\r\nliquids of the same composition. It would appear, however, that no\r\nstearoptene of any other plant is absolutely identical with common\r\ncamphor; Lallemand’s statement (see p. 479), that oil of spike affords\r\nthe latter, requires further examination.\r\n\r\nMany other liquid and solid constituents of essential oils, or\r\nsubstances afforded by treating them with alcoholic potash, answer to\r\nthe formula C₁₀H₁₇(OH). Among them we may point out the two following:\r\nthey are the only substances of the class of “camphors,” besides common\r\ncamphor, which are of some practical importance.\r\n\r\n_Barus Camphor, Borneo Camphor, Malayan Camphor, Dryobalanops\r\nCamphor_—This, as already explained, is the substance to which\r\nthe earliest notices of camphor refer. The tree which affords it\r\nis _Dryobalanops aromatica_ Gärtn. (_D. Camphora_ Colebrooke), of\r\nthe order _Dipterocarpeæ_, one of the most majestic objects of the\r\nvegetable kingdom.[1909] The trunk is very tall, round, and straight,\r\nfurnished near the base with huge buttresses; it rises 100 to 150 feet\r\nwithout a branch, then producing a dense crown of shining foliage, 50\r\nto 70 feet in diameter, on which are scattered beautiful white flowers\r\nof delicious fragrance. The tree is indigenous to the Dutch Residencies\r\non the north-west coast of Sumatra, between 0° and 3° N. lat., from\r\nAyer Bangis to Barus and Singkel, and to the northern part of Borneo,\r\nand the small British island of Labuan.\r\n\r\n[1906] _Commercial Reports from H.

H. de Vriese’s\r\nexcellent _Mémoire sur le Camphrier de Sumatra et de Bornéo_, Leide,\r\n1857. 23 p. 4°. and 2 plates.\r\n\r\nThe camphor is obtained from the trunk, in longitudinal fissures of\r\nwhich it is found in a solid crystalline state, and extracted by\r\nlaboriously splitting the wood. It can only be got by the destruction\r\nof the entire tree;—in fact, many trees afford none, so that to avoid\r\nthe toil of useless felling, it is now customary to try them by cutting\r\na hole in the side of the trunk, but the observation so made is often\r\nfallacious. Spenser St. John, British Consul in Borneo, was told that\r\ntrees in a state of decay often contain the finest camphor.[1910] The\r\ncamphor when collected is carefully picked over, washed and cleaned,\r\nand then separated into three qualities, the best being formed of\r\nthe largest and purest crystals, while the lowest is greyish and\r\npulverulent.\r\n\r\nDryobalanops attaining more than 150 feet in height, the quantity of\r\ncamphor which it yields must necessarily be greatly variable. The\r\nstatements are from about 3 to 11 lb.\r\n\r\nA good proportion of the small quantity produced is consumed in the\r\nfuneral rites of the Batta princes, whose families are often ruined by\r\nthe lavish expense of providing the camphor and buffaloes which the\r\ncustom of their obsequies requires. The camphor which is exported is\r\neagerly bought for the China market, but some is also sent to Japan,\r\nLaos, Cochin China, Cambodia, and Siam.\r\n\r\nThe quantity annually shipped from Borneo was reckoned by Motley in\r\n1851 to be about 7 peculs (933 lbs.). The export from Sumatra was\r\nestimated by De Vriese at 10 to 15 quintals per annum.[1911] The\r\nquantity imported into Canton in 1872 was returned as 23⁷/₁₀ peculs\r\n(3,159 lb.), value 42,326 taels, equivalent to about 80_s._ per\r\nlb.[1912] In the _Annual Statement of the Trade of Bombay_ for the year\r\n1872-3, 2 cwt. of _Malayan Camphor_ is stated to have been imported;\r\nit was valued at 9,141 Rs. (£914). In the “Indian tariff,” 1875, the\r\nduty is fixed _per cwt._ at 40 rupees for crude camphor, 65 rupees\r\nfor refined camphor, and 80 rupees _per pound_ for Baros camphor\r\n(“Bhemsaini camphor”). The price in Borneo in 1851 of camphor of fine\r\nquality was 30 dollars per catty, or about 95_s._ per lb.: consequently\r\nthe drug never finds its way into European commerce.\r\n\r\n[1910] _Life in the Forests of the Far East_, ii. (1862) 272.\r\n\r\n[1911] In Milburn’s time (_Oriental Commerce_, ii. 1813. 308), Sumatra\r\nwas reckoned to export 50 peculs, and Borneo 30 peculs a year. Rondot’s\r\nstatement (see Cassia Buds) that China imports of Barus camphor about\r\n800 peculs annually is plainly erroneous.\r\n\r\n[1912] _Returns of Trade at the Treaty Ports in China for 1872_, p. 30.\r\n\r\nBorneo Camphor, also termed by chemists _Borneol_ or _Camphyl Alcohol_,\r\nis somewhat harder than common camphor, also a little heavier so that\r\nit sinks in water. It is less volatile, and does not crystallize on the\r\ninterior of the bottle in which it is kept; and it requires for fusion\r\na higher temperature, namely 198° C. It has a somewhat different odour,\r\nresembling that of common camphor with the addition of patchouli or\r\nambergris. The composition of borneol is represented by the formula\r\nC₁₀H₁₇(OH). It may be converted by the action of nitric acid into\r\ncommon camphor, which it nearly resembles in most of its physical\r\nproperties. Conversely, borneol may also be prepared from common\r\ncamphor. By continued oxydation borneol yields camphoric acid.\r\n\r\n_Camphor Oil of Borneo_—Besides camphor, the _Dryobalanops_ furnishes\r\nanother product, a liquid termed _Camphor Oil_, which must not be\r\nconfounded with the camphor oil that drains out of crude laurel\r\ncamphor. This Bornean or Sumatran _Camphor Oil_ is obtained by\r\ntapping the trees, or in felling them (see also p. 229). In the latter\r\nway, Motley in cutting down a tree in Labuan in May, 1851, pierced a\r\nreservoir in the trunk from which about five gallons of camphor oil\r\nwere obtained, though much could not be caught.[1913] The liquid was\r\na volatile oil holding in solution a resin, which after a few days’\r\nexposure to the air, was left in a syrupy state. This camphor oil,\r\nwhich is termed _Borneene_, is isomeric with oil of turpentine, C₁₀H₁₆,\r\nyet in the crude state holding in solution borneol and resin. By\r\nfractional distillation, it may be separated into two portions, the one\r\nmore volatile than the other but not differing in composition.\r\n\r\n_Camphor Oil of Formosa_, which has been already referred to as\r\ndraining out of the crude camphor of _Cinnamomum Camphora_, is a brown\r\nliquid holding in solution an abundance of common camphor, which it\r\nspeedily deposits in crystals when the temperature is slightly reduced.\r\nFrom Borneo Camphor Oil it may be distinguished by its _odour of\r\nsassafras_. We find no optical difference in the rotatory power of the\r\noils; both are dextrogyre to the same extent, which is still the case\r\nif the camphor from the lauraceous camphor oil is separated by cooling.\r\nBorneo camphor oil, for a sample of which we are indebted to Prof. de\r\nVriese, deposits no camphor even when kept at -15° C.\r\n\r\n_Ngai Camphor, Blumea Camphor_—It has been known for many years that\r\nthe Chinese are in the habit of using a third variety of camphor,\r\nhaving a pecuniary value intermediate between that of common camphor\r\nand of Borneo camphor. This substance is manufactured at Canton and\r\nin the island of Hainan, the plant from which it is obtained being\r\n_Blumea balsamifera_ DC., a tall herbaceous _Composita_, of the tribe\r\n_Inuloideæ_, called in Chinese _Ngai_, abundant in Tropical Eastern\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nThe drug has been supplied to us[1914] in two forms,—crude and\r\npure,—the first being in crystalline grains of a dirty white,\r\ncontaminated with vegetable remains; the second in colourless crystals\r\nas much as an inch in length. By sublimation the substance may be\r\nobtained in distinct, brilliant crystals, agreeing precisely with those\r\nof Borneo camphor, which they also resemble in odour and hardness, as\r\nwell as in being a little heavier than water and not so volatile as\r\ncommon camphor.\r\n\r\nThe chemical examination of Ngai camphor, performed by Plowman,[1915]\r\nunder the direction of Prof. Attfield, has proved that it has the\r\ncomposition C₁₀H₁₈O, like Borneo camphor. But the two substances differ\r\nin optical properties,[1916] an alcoholic solution of Ngai camphor\r\nbeing _levogyre_ in about the same degree that one of Borneo camphor\r\nis _dextrogyre_. By boiling nitric acid, Borneo camphor is transformed\r\ninto common (_dextrogyre_) camphor, whereas Ngai camphor affords a\r\nsimilar yet _levogyre_ camphor, in all probability identical with the\r\nstearoptene of _Chrysanthemum Parthenium_ Pers.\r\n\r\nAs Ngai camphor is about ten times the price of Formosa camphor, it\r\nnever finds its way to Europe as an article of trade. In China it is\r\nconsumed partly in medicine and partly in perfuming the fine kinds of\r\nChinese ink. The export of this camphor by sea from Canton is valued at\r\nabout £3,000 a year; it is also exported from Kiung-chow, in the island\r\nof Hainan.\r\n\r\n[1913] Ibn Khurdádbah in the 9th century mentions it as being obtained\r\nin this way.\r\n\r\n[1914] Through the courtesy of Mr. F.

It is exceedingly variable in stature,\r\nand in the outline, size and consistence of the leaf; and several\r\nof the extreme forms are very unlike one another and have received\r\nspecific names. But there are also numerous intermediate forms; and\r\nin a large suite of specimens, many occur of which it is impossible\r\nto determine whether they should be referred to this species or to\r\nthat. Thwaites[1917] is of opinion that some still admitted species,\r\nas _C. obtusifolium_ Nees and _C. iners_ Reinw., will prove on further\r\ninvestigation to be mere forms of _C. zeylanicum_.\r\n\r\nBeddome,[1918] Conservator of Forests in Madras, remarks that in the\r\nmoist forests of South-western India there are 7 or 8 well-marked\r\nvarieties which might easily be regarded as so many distinct species,\r\nbut for the fact that they are so connected _inter se_ by intermediate\r\nforms, that it is impossible to find constant characters worthy of\r\nspecific distinction. They grow from the sea-level up to the highest\r\nelevations, and, as Beddome thinks, owe their differences chiefly to\r\nlocal circumstances, so that he is disposed to class them simply as\r\nforms of _C. zeylanicum_.\r\n\r\n=History=—(For that of the essential oil of cinnamon see page 526).\r\nCinnamon was held in high esteem in the most remote times of history.\r\nIn the words of the learned Dr. Vincent, Dean of Westminster,[1919]\r\nit seems to have been the first spice sought after in all oriental\r\nvoyages. Both cinnamon and cassia are mentioned as precious odoriferous\r\nsubstances in the Mosaic writings and in the Biblical books of Psalms,\r\nProverbs, Canticles, Ezekiel and Revelations, also by Theophrastus,\r\nHerodotus, Galen, Dioscorides, Pliny, Strabo and many other writers of\r\nantiquity: and from the accounts which have thus come down to us, there\r\nappears reason for believing that the spices referred to were nearly\r\nthe same as those of the present day. That cinnamon and cassia were\r\nextremely analogous, is proved by the remark of Galen, that the finest\r\ncassia differs so little from the lowest quality of cinnamon, that the\r\nfirst may be substituted for the second, provided a double weight of it\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\n[1917] _Enumeratio Plantarum Zeylaniæ_, 1864. 252.—Consult also\r\nMeissner in De Cand. _Prod._ xv. sect. i. 10.\r\n\r\n[1918] _Flora Sylvatica for Southern India_, 1872. 262.\r\n\r\n[1919] _Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients in the Indian Ocean_,\r\nii. (1807) 512.\r\n\r\nIt is also evident that both were regarded as among the most costly\r\nof aromatics, for the offering made by Seleucus II. Callinicus, king\r\nof Syria, and his brother Antiochus Hierax, to the temple of Apollo\r\nat Miletus, B.C. 243, consisting chiefly of vessels of gold and\r\nsilver, and olibanum, myrrh (σμύρνη), costus (page 382), included also\r\ntwo pounds of _Cassia_ (κασία), and the same quantity of _Cinnamon_\r\n(κιννάμωμον).[1920]\r\n\r\nIn connexion with this subject there is one remarkable fact to be\r\nnoticed, which is that none of the cinnamon of the ancients was\r\nobtained from Ceylon. “In the pages of no author,” says Tennent,[1921]\r\n“European or Asiatic, from the earliest ages to the close of the\r\nthirteenth century, is there the remotest allusion to cinnamon as an\r\nindigenous production, or even as an article of commerce in Ceylon.”\r\nNor do the annuals of the Chinese, between whom and the inhabitants\r\nof Ceylon, from the 4th to the 8th centuries, there was frequent\r\nintercourse and exchange of commodities, name _Cinnamon_ as one of the\r\nproductions of the island. The Sacred Books and other ancient records\r\nof the Singhalese are also completely silent on this point.\r\n\r\nCassia, under the name of _Kwei_, is mentioned in the earliest Chinese\r\nherbal,—that of the emperor Shen-nung, who reigned about 2700 B.C., in\r\nthe ancient Chinese[1922] Classics, and in the _Rh-ya_, a herbal dating\r\nfrom 1200 B.C. In the _Hai-yao-pên-ts’ao_, written in the 8th century,\r\nmention is made of _Tien-chu kwei_. Tien-chu is the ancient name for\r\nIndia: perhaps the allusion may be to the cassia bark of Malabar.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with these extremely early references to the spice, it may\r\nbe stated that a bark supposed to be _cassia_ is mentioned as imported\r\ninto Egypt together with gold, ivory, frankincense, precious woods, and\r\napes, in the 17th century B.C.[1923]\r\n\r\nThe accounts given by Dioscorides, Ptolemy and the author of the\r\nPeriplus of the Erythrean Sea, indicate that cinnamon and cassia were\r\nobtained from Arabia and Eastern Africa; and we further know that the\r\nimporters were Phœnicians, who traded by Egypt and the Red Sea with\r\nArabia. Whether the spice under notice was really a production of\r\nArabia or Africa, or whether it was imported thither from Southern\r\nChina (the present source of the best sort of cassia), is a question\r\nwhich has excited no small amount of discussion.\r\n\r\nWe are in favour of the second alternative,—firstly, because no\r\nsubstance of the nature of cinnamon is known to be produced in Arabia\r\nor Africa; and secondly, because the commercial intercourse which\r\nwas undoubtedly carried on by China with India and Arabia, and which\r\nalso existed between Arabia, India and Africa, is amply sufficient to\r\nexplain the importation of Chinese produce.[1924] That the spice was a\r\nproduction of the far East is moreover implied by the name _Darchini_\r\n(from _dar_, wood or bark, and _Chini_, Chinese) given to it by the\r\nArabians and Persians.\r\n\r\n[1920] Chishull, _Antiquities Asiaticæ_, 1728. 65-72.\r\n\r\n[1921] _Ceylon_, i (1859) 575.\r\n\r\n[1922] We are indebted to Dr. Bretschneider of Pekin for these\r\nreferences to Chinese literature. For information about some of the\r\nworks quoted, see his pamphlet _On the Study and Value of Chinese\r\nBotanical Works_, Foochow, 1870.\r\n\r\n[1923] Dümichen, _Fleet of an Egyptian Queen_, Leipzig, 1868, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[1924] “ ... That there was an ulterior commerce beyond Ceylon is\r\nindubitable; for at Ceylon the trade from Malacca and the Golden\r\nChersonese met the merchants from Arabia, Persia and Egypt. This might\r\npossibly have been in the hands of the Malays or even the Chinese,\r\nwho seem to have been navigators in all ages as universally as the\r\nArabians....” Vincent, _op. cit._ ii. 284. 285.—In the time of Marco\r\nPolo, the trade of China westward met the trade of the Red Sea, no\r\nlonger in Ceylon, but on the coast of Malabar, apparently at Calicut,\r\nwhere the Portuguese found it on their first arrival. Here, says Marco,\r\nthe ships from Aden obtained their lading from the East, and carried it\r\ninto the Red Sea for Alexandria, whence it passed into Europe by means\r\nof the Venetians.—See also Yule, _Book of Ser Marco Polo_, ii. (1871)\r\n325, 327.\r\n\r\nIf this view of the case is admissible, we must regard the ancient\r\ncinnamon to have been the substance now known as _Chinese Cassia\r\nlignea_ or _Chinese Cinnamon_, and cassia as one of the thicker and\r\nperhaps less aromatic barks of the same group, such in fact as are\r\nstill found in commerce.\r\n\r\nOf the circumstances which led to the collection of cinnamon in Ceylon,\r\nand of the period at which it was commenced, nothing is known. That\r\nthe Chinese were concerned in the discovery is not an unreasonable\r\nsupposition, seeing that they traded to Ceylon, and were in all\r\nprobability acquainted with the cassia-yielding species of _Cinnamomum_\r\nof Southern China, a tree extremely like the cinnamon tree of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the facts, the early notices of cinnamon as a\r\nproduction of Ceylon are not prior to the 13th century. The very first,\r\naccording to Yule,[1925] is a mention of the spice by Kazwini, an Arab\r\nwriter of about A.D. 1275, very soon after which period it is noticed\r\nby the historian of the Egyptian Sultan Kelaoun, A.D. 1283. The prince\r\nof Ceylon is stated to have sent an ambassador, Al-Hadj-Abu-Othman, to\r\nthe Sultan’s court. It was mentioned that Ceylon produced elephants,\r\nBakam (the wood of _Cæsalpinia Sapan_ L.—see page 216), pearls and also\r\n_cinnamon_.[1926]\r\n\r\nA still more positive evidence is due to the Minorite friar, John of\r\nMontecorvino, a missionary who visited India. This man, in a letter\r\nunder date December 20th, 1292 or 1293, written at “Mabar, città dell’\r\nIndia di sopra,” and still extant in the Medicean library at Florence,\r\nsays that the cinnamon tree is of medium bulk, and in trunk, bark and\r\nfoliage, like a laurel, and that great store of its bark is carried\r\nforth from the island which is near by Malabar.[1927]\r\n\r\nAgain, it is mentioned by the Mahomedan traveller Ibn Batuta about A.D.\r\n1340,[1928] and a century later by the Venetian merchant Nicolo di\r\nConti, whose description of the tree is very correct.[1929]\r\n\r\nThe circumnavigation of the Cape of Good Hope led to the real discovery\r\nof Ceylon by the Portuguese in 1505, and to their permanent occupation\r\nof the island in 1536, chiefly for the sake of the cinnamon. It is from\r\nthe first of these dates that more exact accounts of the spice began to\r\nreach Europe. Thus in 1511 Barbosa distinguished the fine cinnamon of\r\nCeylon from the inferior _Canella trista_ of Malabar. Garcia de Orta,\r\nabout the middle of the same century, stated that Ceylon cinnamon was\r\nforty times as dear as that of Malabar. Clusius, the translator of\r\nGarcia, saw branches of the cinnamon tree as early as 1571 at Bristol\r\nand in Holland.\r\n\r\n[1925] _Marco Polo_, ii. 255.\r\n\r\n[1926] _Quatremère_ (in the book quoted at page 511, note 4), ii. 284.\r\n\r\n[1927] Yule, _Cathay and the way thither_, i. 213, also Kunstmann,\r\n_Anzeigen der baierischen Akademie_, 24 and 25 December 1855. p. 163\r\nand 169.\r\n\r\n[1928] _Travels of Ibn Batuta_, translated by Lee, Lond. 1829. 184.\r\n\r\n[1929] Ramusio, _Raccolta delle Navigationi et Viaggi_, i. (1563) 339;\r\nKunstmann, _Kenntniss Indiens im fünfzehnten Jahrhundert_, 1864. 39.\r\n\r\nAt this period cinnamon was cut from trees growing wild in the forests\r\nin the interior of Ceylon, the bark being exacted as tribute from the\r\nSinghalese kings by the Portuguese. A peculiar caste called _chalias_,\r\nwho are said to have emigrated from India to Ceylon in the 13th\r\ncentury, and who in after-times became cinnamon-peelers, delivered the\r\nbark to the Portuguese. The cruel oppression of these _chalias_ was not\r\nmitigated by the Dutch, who from the year 1656 were virtually masters\r\nof the whole seaboard, and conceded the cinnamon trade to their East\r\nIndia Company as a profitable monopoly, which the Company exercised\r\nwith the greatest severity.[1930] The bark previous to shipment was\r\nminutely examined by special officers, to guard against frauds on the\r\npart of the _chalias_.\r\n\r\nAbout 1770 De Koke conceived the happy idea, in opposition to the\r\nuniversal prejudice in favour of wild-growing cinnamon, of attempting\r\nthe cultivation of the tree. This project was carried out under\r\nGovernors Falck and Van der Graff with extraordinary success, so that\r\nthe Dutch were able, independently of the kingdom of Kandy, to furnish\r\nabout 400,000 lb. of cinnamon annually, thereby supplying the entire\r\nEuropean demand. In fact, they completely ruled the trade, and would\r\neven _burn_ the cinnamon in Holland, lest its unusual abundance should\r\nreduce the price.\r\n\r\nAfter Ceylon had been wrested from the Dutch by the English in 1796,\r\nthe cinnamon trade became the monopoly of the English East India\r\nCompany, who then obtained more cinnamon from the forests, especially\r\nafter the year 1815, when the kingdom of Kandy fell under British rule.\r\nBut though the _chalias_ had much increased in numbers, the yearly\r\nproduction of cinnamon does not appear to have exceeded 500,000 lb. The\r\ncondition of the unfortunate _chalias_ was not ameliorated until 1833,\r\nwhen the monopoly granted to the Company was finally abolished, and\r\nGovernment, ceasing to be the sole exporters of cinnamon, permitted the\r\nmerchants of Colombo and Galle to share in the trade.\r\n\r\nCinnamon however was still burdened with an export duty equal to a\r\nthird or a half of its value; in consequence of which and of the\r\ncompetition with cinnamon raised in Java, and with cassia from China\r\nand other places, the cultivation in Ceylon began to suffer. This duty\r\nwas not removed until 1853.\r\n\r\nThe earliest notice of cinnamon in connexion with Northern Europe that\r\nwe have met with, is the diploma granted by Chilperic II., king of the\r\nFranks, to the monastery of Corbie in Normandy, A.D. 716, in which\r\nprovision is made for a certain supply of spices and grocery, including\r\n5 lb. of _Cinnamon_.[1931]\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary value set on cinnamon at this period is remarkably\r\nillustrated by some letters written from Italy, in which mention\r\nis here and there incidentally made of presents of spices and\r\nincense.[1932] Thus in A.D. 745, Gemmulus, a Roman deacon, sends to\r\nBoniface, archbishop of Mayence (“_cum magnâ reverentiâ_”), 4 ounces\r\nof _Cinnamon_, 4 ounces of Costus, and 2 pounds of Pepper. In A.D.\r\n748, Theophilacias, a Roman archdeacon, presents to the same bishop\r\nsimilar spices and incense. Lullus, the successor of Boniface, sends to\r\nEadburga, _abbatissa Thanetensis_,[1933] _circa_ A.D. 732-751—“_unum\r\ngraphium argenteum et storacis et_ cinnamomi _partem aliquam_”; and\r\nabout the same date, another present of cinnamon to archbishop Boniface\r\nis recorded. Under date A.D. 732-742, a letter is extant of three\r\npersons to the abbess Cuneburga, to whom the writers offer—“_turis et\r\npiperis et_ cinnamomi _permodica xenia, sed omni mentis affectione\r\ndestinata_.”\r\n\r\n[1930] Tennent, _op. cit._ ii. 52.\r\n\r\n[1931] Pardessus, _Diplomata_, etc., Paris, 1849. ii. 309.\r\n\r\n[1932] Jaffé, _Bibliotheca Rerum Germanicarum_, Berlin, iii.

She died A.D. 751.\r\n\r\nIn the 9th century, _Cinnamon_, pepper, costus, cloves, and several\r\nindigenous aromatic plants were used in the monastery of St. Gall in\r\nSwitzerland as ingredients for seasoning fish.[1934]\r\n\r\nOf the pecuniary value of this spice in England, there are many notices\r\nfrom the year 1264 downwards.[1935] In the 16th century it was probably\r\nnot plentiful, if we may judge from the fact that it figures among the\r\nNew Year’s gifts to Philip and Mary (1556-57), and to Queen Elizabeth\r\n(1561-62).[1936]\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=[1937]—The best cinnamon is produced,\r\naccording to Thwaites,[1938] from a cultivated or selected form of the\r\ntree (var. α.), distinguished by large leaves of somewhat irregular\r\nshape. But the bark of all the forms possesses the odour of cinnamon\r\nin a greater or less degree. It is not however always possible to\r\njudge of the quality of the bark from the foliage, so that the peelers\r\nwhen collecting from uncultivated trees, are in the habit of tasting\r\nthe bark before commencing operations, and pass over some trees as\r\nunfit for their purpose. The bark of varieties β. _multiflorum_ and\r\nγ. _ovalifolium_ is of very inferior quality, and said to be never\r\ncollected unless for the purpose of adulteration.\r\n\r\nThe best variety appears to find the conditions most favourable to\r\nits culture, in the strip of country, 12 to 15 miles broad, on the\r\nsouth-west coast of Ceylon, between Negumbo, Colombo and Matura,\r\nwhere the tree is grown up to an elevation of 1500 feet. A very\r\nsandy clay soil, or fine white quartz, with a good sub-soil and free\r\nexposure to the sun and rain, are the circumstances best adapted for\r\nthe cultivation. The management of the plantations resembles that of\r\noak coppice in England. The system of pruning checks the plant from\r\nbecoming a tree, and induces it to form a stool from which four or five\r\nshoots are allowed to grow; these are cut at the age of 1½ to 2 years,\r\nwhen the greyish-green epidermis begins to turn brown by reason of the\r\nformation of a corky layer. They are not all cut at the same time, but\r\nonly as they arrive at the proper state of maturity; they are then 6 to\r\n10 feet high and 1 to 2 inches thick. In some of the cinnamon gardens\r\nat Colombo, the stools are very large and old, dating back, it is\r\nsupposed, from the time of the Dutch.\r\n\r\n[1934] _Pharm. Journ._ viii.

The bark is next cut through at distances of about\r\na foot, and slit lengthwise, when it is easily and completely removed\r\nby the insertion of a peculiar knife termed a _mama_, the separation\r\nbeing assisted, if necessary, by strongly rubbing with the handle. The\r\npieces of bark are now carefully put one into another, and the compound\r\nsticks firmly bound together into bundles. Thus they are left for 24\r\nhours or more, during which a sort of “_fermentation_” (?) goes on\r\nwhich facilitates the subsequent removal part. This is accomplished\r\nby placing each quill on a stick of wood of suitable thickness, and\r\ncarefully scraping off with a knife the outer and middle cortical\r\nlayer. In a few hours after this operation, the peeler commences to\r\nplace the smaller tubes within the larger, also inserting the small\r\npieces so as to make up an almost solid stick, of about 40 inches in\r\nlength. The cinnamon thus prepared is kept one day in the shade, and\r\nthen placed on wicker trays in the sun to dry. When sufficiently dry,\r\nit is made into bundles of about 30 lb. each.[1939]\r\n\r\nThe cinnamon gardens of Ceylon were estimated in 1860-64 to occupy an\r\narea of about 14,400 acres; in the catalogue of the British Colonies,\r\nParis Exhibition, 1878, about 2 millions of acres are stated to be\r\nunder cultivation in the island, 26,000 acres with cinnamon.[1940]\r\n\r\nThe exports of cinnamon from Ceylon have been as follows:—\r\n\r\n       1871             1872             1875\r\n    1,359,327 lb.,   1,267,953 lb.,   1,500,000 lb.\r\n    value £67,966.   value £64,747.\r\n\r\nAt present the cultivation of coffee is displacing that of cinnamon,\r\nthe exports of the former in 1875 being 928,606 cwts. valued at 4¼\r\nmillions sterling. Of the crop of 1872 there were 1,179,516 lb. of\r\ncinnamon shipped to the United Kingdom, 53,439 lb. to the United States\r\nof North America, and 10,000 lb. to Hamburg.\r\n\r\nBesides the above-named exports of cinnamon, the official\r\nstatistics[1941] record the export of “_Cinnamon Bark_”—8846 lb. in\r\n1871—23,449 lb. in 1872. This name includes two distinct articles,\r\nnamely _Cinnamon Chips_, and a very thick bark derived from old stems.\r\nThe _Cinnamon Chips_ which, as explained on the previous page, are\r\nthe first trimmings of the shoots, are very aromatic; they used to\r\nbe considered worthless, and were thrown away. The second article,\r\nto which in the London drug sales the name “_Cinnamon Bark_” is\r\nrestricted, is in flat or slightly channelled fragments, which are as\r\nmuch as ⁴/₁₀ of an inch in thickness, and remind one of New Granada\r\ncinchona bark. It is very deficient in aromatic qualities, and quite\r\nunfit for use in pharmacy.\r\n\r\n[1939] Formerly called _fardela_ or _fardello_, a name signifying in\r\nthe Romance languages _bundle_ or _package_. The word _fardel_, having\r\nthe same meaning, is found in old English writers.\r\n\r\n[1940] Yet the cultivation was far more extensive in the earlier\r\npart of the century, as we may judge by the statement that the five\r\nprincipal cinnamon gardens around Negumbo, Colombo, Barberyn, Galle,\r\nand Matura, were _each from 15 to 20 miles in circumference_ (Tennent’s\r\n_Ceylon_, ii. 163).\r\n\r\n[1941] _Ceylon Blue Books_ for 1871 and 1872, printed at Colombo.\r\n\r\nIn most other countries into which _Cinnamomum zeylanicum_ has been\r\ntransplanted, it has been found that, partly from its tendency to pass\r\ninto new varieties and partly perhaps from want of careful cultivation\r\nand the absence of the skilled cinnamon-peeler, it yields a bark\r\nappreciably different from that of Ceylon. Of other cinnamon-producing\r\ndistricts, those of Southern India may be mentioned as affording the\r\n_Malabar_ or _Tinnevelly_, and the _Tellicherry Cinnamon_ of commerce,\r\nthe latter being almost as good as the cinnamon of Ceylon.[1942] The\r\ncultivation in Java commenced in 1825. The plant, according to Miquel,\r\nis a variety of _C. zeylanicum_, distinguished by its very large leaves\r\nwhich are frequently 8 inches long by 5 inches broad. The island\r\nexported in 1870, 1109 peculs (147,866 lb.); in 1871 only 446 peculs\r\n(59,466 lb.).[1943]\r\n\r\nCinnamon is also grown in the French colony of Guyana and in Brazil,\r\nbut on an insignificant scale. The samples of the bark from those\r\ncountries which we have examined are quite unlike the cinnamon of\r\nCeylon. That of Brazil in particular has evidently been taken from\r\nstems several years old.\r\n\r\nThe importations of cinnamon into the United Kingdom from Ceylon are\r\nshown by the following figures:—\r\n\r\n         1867         1869           1870\r\n      859,034 lb.  2,611,473 lb.  2,148,405 lb.\r\n\r\n       1871           1872           1876\r\n    1,430,518 lb.  1,015,461 lb.  1,339,060 lb.\r\n\r\nDuring 1872, 56,000 lb. of cinnamon were imported from other countries.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Ceylon cinnamon of the finest description is imported\r\nin the form of sticks, about 40 inches in length and ⅜ of an inch\r\nin thickness, formed of tubular pieces of bark about a foot long,\r\ndexterously arranged one within the other, so as to form an even rod of\r\nconsiderable firmness and solidity. The quills of bark are not rolled\r\nup as simple tubes, but each side curls inwards so as to form a channel\r\nwith in-curving sides, a circumstance that gives to the entire stick\r\na somewhat flattened cylindrical form. The bark composing the stick\r\nis extremely thin, measuring often no more than ¹/₁₁₁₁ of an inch in\r\nthickness. It has a light brown, dull surface, faintly marked with\r\nshining wavy lines, and bearing here and there scars or holes at the\r\npoints of insertion of leaves or twigs. The inner surface of the bark\r\nis of a darker hue. The bark is brittle and splintery, with a fragrant\r\nodour, peculiar to itself and the allied barks of the same genus. Its\r\ntaste is saccharine, pungent, and aromatic.\r\n\r\n[1942] Some of it however is very thick, though neatly quilled.\r\n\r\n[1943] _Consular Reports_, Aug. 1873. 952.\r\n\r\nThe bales of cinnamon which arrive in London are always re-packed\r\nin the dock warehouses, in doing which a certain amount of breakage\r\noccurs. The spice so injured is kept separate and sold as _Small\r\nCinnamon_, and is very generally used for pharmaceutical purposes. It\r\nis often of excellent quality.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—By the peeling above described, Ceylon\r\ncinnamon is deprived of the suberous coat and the greater part of the\r\nmiddle cortical layer, so that it almost consists of the mere liber\r\n(_endophlœum_). Three different layers are to be distinguished on a\r\ntransverse section of this tissue:—\r\n\r\n1. The external surface which is composed of one to three rows of large\r\nthick-walled cells, forming a coherent ring; it is only interrupted by\r\nbundles of liber-fibres, which are obvious even to the unaided eye;\r\nthey compose in fact the wavy lines mentioned in the last page.\r\n\r\n2. The middle layer is built up of about ten rows of parenchymatous\r\nthin-walled cells, interrupted by much larger cells containing deposits\r\nof mucilage, while other cells, not larger than those of the parenchyme\r\nitself, are loaded with essential oil.\r\n\r\n3. The innermost layer exhibits the same thin-walled but smaller\r\ncells, yet intersected by narrow, somewhat darker, medullary rays, and\r\nlikewise interrupted by cells containing either mucilage or essential\r\noil.\r\n\r\nInstead of bundles of liber-fibres, fibres mostly isolated are\r\nscattered through the two inner layers, the parenchyme of which\r\nabounds in small starch granules accompanied by tannic matter. On a\r\nlongitudinal section, the length of the liber-fibres becomes more\r\nevident, as well as oil-ducts and gum-ducts.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most interesting and noteworthy constituent\r\nof cinnamon is the essential oil, which the bark yields to the extent\r\nof ½ to 1 per cent., and which is distilled in Ceylon,—very seldom in\r\nEngland. It was prepared by Valerius Cordus, who stated,[1944] somewhat\r\nbefore 1544, that the oils of _cinnamon_ and _cloves_ belong to the\r\nsmall number of essential oils which are heavier than water, “fundum\r\npetunt.” About 1571 the essential oils of _cinnamon_, mace, _cloves_,\r\n_pepper_, nutmegs and several others, were also distilled by Guintherus\r\nof Andernach,[1945] and again, about the year 1589, by Porta.[1946]\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the last century, it used to be brought to Europe\r\nby the Dutch. During the five years from 1775 to 1779 inclusive, the\r\naverage quantity _annually_ disposed of at the sales of the Dutch\r\nEast India Company was 176 ounces. The wholesale price in London\r\nbetween 1776 and 1782 was 21_s._ per ounce; but from 1785 to 1789, the\r\noil fetched 63_s._ to 68_s._, the increase in value being doubtless\r\noccasioned by the war with Holland commenced in 1782. The oil is now\r\nlargely produced in Ceylon, from which island the quantity exported in\r\n1871 was 14,796 ounces; and in 1872, 39,100 ounces.[1947] The oil is\r\nshipped chiefly to England.\r\n\r\nOil of cinnamon is a golden yellow liquid, having a sp. gr. of 1·035,\r\na powerful cinnamon odour, and a sweet and aromatic but burning taste.\r\nIt deviates a ray of polarized light a very little to the left. The oil\r\nconsists chiefly of _Cinnamic Aldehyde_, C₆H₅(CH)₂COH, together with a\r\nvariable proportion of hydrocarbons. At a low temperature it becomes\r\nturbid by the deposit of a camphor, which we have not examined. The oil\r\neasily absorbs oxygen, becoming thereby contaminated with resin and\r\ncinnamic acid, C₆H₅(CH)₂COOH.\r\n\r\n[1944] In his book “De artificiosis extractionibus,” published by\r\nGesner, Argentorati, 1561, fol. 226.\r\n\r\n[1945] _De medicina veteri et nova_, Basileæ, 1571. 630-635.\r\n\r\n[1946] _Magiæ Naturalis libri xx._ Neapoli 1589. 184.\r\n\r\n[1947] _Ceylon Blue Books_ for 1871 and 1872.\r\n\r\nCinnamon contains sugar, mannite, starch, mucilage, and tannic acid.\r\nThe _Cinnamomin_ of Martin (1868) has been shown by Wittstein to be\r\nvery probably mere mannite. The effect of iodine on a decoction of\r\ncinnamon will be noticed under the head of Cassia Lignea. Cinnamon\r\nafforded to Schätzler (1862) 5 per cent. of ash consisting chiefly of\r\nthe carbonates of calcium and potassium.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Cinnamon is used in medicine as a cordial and stimulant, but is\r\nmuch more largely consumed as a spice.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Cassia lignea being much cheaper than cinnamon, is very\r\ncommonly substituted for it. So long as the bark is entire, there is no\r\ndifficulty in its recognition, but if it should have been reduced to\r\npowder, the case is widely different. We have found the following tests\r\nof some service, when the spice to be examined is in powder:—Make a\r\ndecoction of powdered cinnamon of known genuineness; and one of similar\r\nstrength of the suspected powder. When cool and strained, test a fluid\r\nounce of each with one or two drops of tincture of iodine. A decoction\r\nof cinnamon is but little affected, but in that of cassia a deep\r\nblue-black tint is immediately produced (see further on, Cort. Cassiæ).\r\nThe cheap kinds of cassia, known as _Cassia vera_, may be distinguished\r\nfrom the more valuable _Chinese Cassia_, as well as from cinnamon, by\r\ntheir richness in mucilage. This can be extracted by cold water as a\r\nthick glairy liquid, giving dense ropy precipitates with corrosive\r\nsublimate or neutral acetate of lead, but not with alcohol.\r\n\r\nOther products of the Cinnamon Tree.\r\n\r\n_Essential Oil of Cinnamon Leaf_ (_Oleum Cinnamomi foliorum_)—This is a\r\nbrown, viscid, essential oil, of clove-like odour, which is sometimes\r\nexported from Ceylon. It has been examined by Stenhouse (1854), who\r\nfound it to have a sp. gr. of 1·053, and to consist of a mixture of\r\n_Eugenol_ (p. 284) with a neutral hydrocarbon having the formula\r\nC₁₀H₁₆. It also contains a small quantity of benzoic acid.\r\n\r\n_Essential Oil of Cinnamon Root_ (_Oleum Cinnamomi radicis_)—A yellow\r\nliquid, lighter than water, having a mixed odour of camphor and\r\ncinnamon, and a strong camphoraceous taste. Both this oil and that of\r\nthe leaf were described by Kämpfer (1712) and by Seba in 1731,[1948]\r\nand perhaps by Garcia de Orta so early as 1563. Solid camphor may\r\nalso be obtained from the root. A water distilled from the flowers,\r\nand a fatty oil expressed from the fruits are likewise noticed by old\r\nwriters, but are unknown to us.\r\n\r\n[1948] _Phil. Trans._ xxxvi. (1731) 107.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTEX CASSIÆ LIGNEÆ.\r\n\r\n_Cassia Lignea_, _Cassia Bark_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—Various species of _Cinnamomum_ occurring in the\r\nwarm countries of Asia from India eastward, afford what is termed in\r\ncommerce _Cassia Bark_. The trees are extremely variable in foliage,\r\ninflorescences and aromatic properties, and the distinctness of several\r\nof the species laid down even in recent works is still uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe bark which bears _par excellence_ the name of _Cassia_ or _Cassia\r\nlignea_, and which is distinguished on the Continent as _Chinese\r\nCinnamon_, is a production of the provinces of Kwangtung, Kwangsi and\r\nKweichau in Southern China. The French expedition of Lieut. Garnier\r\nfor the exploration of the Mekong and of Cochin China (1866-68) found\r\ncassia growing in about N. lat. 19° in the forests of the valley of\r\nthe Se Ngum, one of the affluents on the left bank of the Mekong near\r\nthe frontiers of Annam. A part of this cassia is carried by land into\r\nChina, while another part is conveyed to Bangkok.[1949] Although it is\r\ncustomary to refer it without hesitation to a tree named _Cinnamomum\r\nCassia_, we find no warrant for such reference: no competent observer\r\nhas visited and described the cassia-yielding districts of China\r\nproper, and brought therefrom the specimens requisite for ascertaining\r\nthe botanical origin of the bark.[1950]\r\n\r\nCassia lignea is also produced in the Khasya mountains in Eastern\r\nBengal, whence it is brought down to Calcutta for shipment.[1951] In\r\nthis region there are three species of _Cinnamomum_, growing at 1000\r\nto 4000 feet above the sea-level, and all have bark with the flavour\r\nof cinnamon, more or less pure: they are _C. obtusifolium_ Nees, _C.\r\npauciflorum_ Nees, and _C. Tamala_ Fr. Nees et Eberm.\r\n\r\n_Cinnamomum iners_ Reinw., a very variable species occurring in\r\nContinental India, Ceylon, Tavoy, Java, Sumatra and other islands\r\nof the Indian Archipelago, and possibly in the opinion of Thwaites\r\na mere variety of _C. zeylanicum_, but according to Meissner well\r\ndistinguished by its paler, thinner leaves, its nervation, and the\r\ncharacter of its aroma, would appear to yield the cassia bark or wild\r\ncinnamon of Southern India.[1952]\r\n\r\n_C. Tamala_ Fr. Nees et Eberm., which besides growing in Khasya is\r\nfound in the contiguous regions of Silhet, Sikkim, Nepal, and Kumaon,\r\nand even reaches Australia, probably affords some cassia bark in\r\nNorthern India.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of a thick sort of cassia have at times been imported\r\nfrom Singapore and Batavia, much of which is produced in Sumatra.\r\nIn the absence of any very reliable information as to its botanical\r\nsources, we may suggest as probable mother plants, _C. Cassia_ Bl. and\r\n_C. Burmanni_ Bl., var. α. _chinense_, both stated by Teijsmann and\r\nBinnendijk to be cultivated in Java.[1953] The latter species, growing\r\nalso in the Philippines, most probably affords the cassia bark which is\r\nshipped from Manila.\r\n\r\n[1949] Thorel, _Notes médicales du Voyage d’Exploration du Mékong et\r\nde Cochinchine_, Paris, 1870. 30.—Garnier, _Voyage en Indo-Chine_, ii.\r\n(Paris, 1873) 438.\r\n\r\n[1950] The greatest market in China for cassia and cinnamon according\r\nto Dr. F.

(1855) 303.\r\n\r\n[1952] A specimen of the stem-bark of _C. iners_ from Travancore,\r\npresented to us by Dr. Waring, has a delightful odour, but is quite\r\ndevoid of the taste of cinnamon.\r\n\r\n[1953] _Catalogues Plantarum quæ in Horto Botanico Bogoriensi\r\ncoluntur_, Batavia, 1866. 92.\r\n\r\n=History=—In the preceding article we have indicated (p. 520) the\r\nremote period at which cassia bark appears to have been known to\r\nthe Chinese; and have stated the reasons that led us to believe the\r\ncinnamon of the ancients was that substance. It must, however, be\r\nobserved that Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Pliny, Strabo and others,\r\nas well as the remarkable inscription on the temple of Apollo at\r\nMiletus, represent cinnamon and cassia as distinct, but nearly allied\r\nsubstances. While, on the other hand, the author of the Periplus of the\r\nErythrean Sea, in enumerating the products shipped from the various\r\ncommercial ports of Eastern Africa[1954] in the first century, mentions\r\n_Cassia_ (κμσία or κασσία) of various kinds, but never employs the word\r\n_Cinnamon_ (κινναμώμον).\r\n\r\nIn the list of productions of India on which duty was levied at the\r\nRoman custom-house at Alexandria, _circa_ A.D. 176-180, _Cinnamomum_\r\nis mentioned as well as _Cassia turiana_, _Xylocassia_ and\r\n_Xylocinnamomum_.[1955] Of the distinction here drawn between cinnamon\r\nand cassia we can give no explanation; but it is worthy of note that\r\n_twigs_ and _branches_ of a _Cinnamomum_ are sold in the Chinese drug\r\nshops, and may not improbably be the _xylocassia_ or _xylocinnamon_ of\r\nthe ancients.[1956] The name _Cassia lignea_ would seem to have been\r\noriginally bestowed on some such substance, rather than as at present\r\non a mere bark. The spice was also undoubtedly called _Cassia syrinx_\r\nand _Cassia fistularis_ (p. 221),—names which evidently refer to a\r\nbark which had the form of a tube. In fact there may well have been a\r\ndiversity of qualities, some perhaps very costly. It is remarkable that\r\nsuch is still the case in China, and that the wealthy Chinese employ a\r\nthick variety of cassia, the price of which is as much as 18 dollars\r\nper catty, or about 56_s._ per lb.[1957]\r\n\r\nWhether the _Aromata Cassiæ_, which were presented to the Church at\r\nRome under St. Silvester, A.D. 314-335, was the modern cassia bark, is\r\nrather doubtful. The largest donation, 200 lb., which was accompanied\r\nby pepper, saffron, storax, cloves, and balsam, would appear to have\r\narrived from Egypt.[1958] Cassia seems to have been known in Western\r\nEurope as early as the 7th century, for it is mentioned with cinnamon\r\nby St. Isidore, archbishop of Seville.[1959] Cassia is named in one of\r\nthe Leech-books in use in England prior to the Norman conquest.[1960]\r\nThe spice was then sold in London as _Canel_ in 1264, at 10_d._ per\r\nlb., sugar being at the same time 12_d._, cumin 2_d._, and ginger\r\n18_d._[1961] In the _Boke of Nurture_,[1962] written in the 15th\r\ncentury by John Russell, chamberlain to Humphry, duke of Gloucester,\r\ncassia is spoken of as resembling cinnamon, but cheaper and commoner,\r\nexactly as at the present day.\r\n\r\n[1954] Vincent, _Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients in the\r\nIndian Ocean_, ii. (1807) 130. 134. 149. 150. 157.—That the ancients\r\nshould confound the different kinds of cassia is really no matter\r\nfor surprise, when we moderns, whether botanists, pharmacologists,\r\nor spice-dealers, are unable to point out characters by which to\r\ndistinguish the barks of this group, or even to give definite names to\r\nthose found in our warehouses.\r\n\r\n[1955] Vincent, _op. cit._ ii. 701-716.\r\n\r\n[1956] See further on, Allied Products, _Cassia twigs_, page 533.\r\n\r\n[1957] Very fine specimens of this costly bark have been kindly\r\nsupplied to us by Dr. H.

Dr. Hooker who\r\nvisited the district with Dr. Thomson in 1850, observes that the trade\r\nin the bark is of recent introduction.[1963] The bark which varies much\r\nin thickness, has been scraped of its outer layer.\r\n\r\nCassia is extensively produced in Sumatra, as may be inferred from\r\nthe fact that Padang in that island, exported of the bark in 1871,\r\n6127 peculs (817,066 lb.), a large proportion of which was shipped to\r\nAmerica.[1964] Regarding the collection of cassia on the Malabar coast,\r\nin Java and in the Philippines, no particular account has, so far as\r\nwe know, been published. Spain imported from the Philippines by way of\r\nCadiz in 1871, 93,000 lb. of cassia.[1965]\r\n\r\n=Description=—_Chinese Cassia lignea_, otherwise called _Chinese\r\nCinnamon_, which of all the varieties is that most esteemed, and\r\napproaching most nearly to Ceylon cinnamon, arrives in small bundles\r\nabout a foot in length and a pound in weight, the pieces of bark being\r\nheld together with bands of bamboo.\r\n\r\nThe bark has a general resemblance to cinnamon, but is in simple\r\nquills, not inserted one within the other. The quills moreover are less\r\nstraight, even and regular, and are of a darker brown; and though some\r\nof the bark is extremely thin, other pieces are much stouter than fine\r\ncinnamon,—in fact, it is much less uniform. The outer coat has been\r\nremoved with less care than that of Ceylon cinnamon, and pieces can\r\neasily be found with the corky layer untouched by the knife.\r\n\r\nCassia bark breaks with a short fracture. The thicker bark cut\r\ntransversely shows a faint white line in the centre running parallel\r\nwith the surface. Good cassia in taste resembles cinnamon, than which\r\nit is not less sweet and aromatic, though it is often described as less\r\nfine and delicate in flavour.\r\n\r\nAn unusual kind of cassia lignea is imported since 1870 from China and\r\noffered in the London market as _China Cinnamon_,[1966] though it is\r\nnot the bark that bears this name in continental trade. The new drug\r\nis in _unscraped_ quills, which are mostly of about the thickness of\r\nordinary Chinese cassia lignea; it has a very saccharine taste and\r\npungent cinnamon flavour.\r\n\r\n[1963] Hooker, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n[1964] _Consular Reports_, August 1873. 953.\r\n\r\n[1965] Consul Reade, _Report on the Trade, etc., of Cadiz for 1871_,\r\nwhere the spice is called “_cinnamon_.”\r\n\r\n[1966] Flückiger in Wiggers and Husemann’s _Jahresbericht_ for 1872. 52.\r\n\r\nThe less esteemed kinds of cassia bark, which of late years have\r\nbeen poured into the market in vast quantity, are known in commerce\r\nas _Cassia lignea_, _Cassia vera_ or _Wild Cassia_, and are further\r\ndistinguished by the names of the localities whence shipped, as\r\nCalcutta, Java, Timor, etc.\r\n\r\nThe barks thus met with vary exceedingly in colour, thickness and\r\naroma, so that it is vain to attempt any general classification.\r\nSome have a pale cinnamon hue, but most are of a deep rich brown.\r\nThey present all variations in thickness, from that of cardboard to\r\nmore than a quarter of an inch thick. The flavour is more or less\r\nthat of cinnamon, often with some unpleasant addition suggestive\r\nof insects of the genus _Cimex_. Many, besides being aromatic, are\r\nhighly mucilaginous, the mucilage being freely imparted to cold water.\r\nFinally, we have met with some thick cassia bark of good appearance\r\nthat was distinguished by astringency and the almost entire absence of\r\naroma.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—A transverse section of such pieces of\r\n_Chinese Cassia lignea_ as still bear the suberous envelope, exhibits\r\nthe following characters. The external surface is made up of several\r\nrows of the usual cork-cells, loaded with brown colouring matter.\r\nIn pieces from which the cork-cells have been entirely scraped, the\r\nsurface is formed of the mesophlœum, yet by far the largest part of\r\nthe bark belongs to the liber or endophlœum. Isolated liber-fibres and\r\nthick-walled cells (stone-cells) are scattered even through the outer\r\nlayers of a transverse section. In the middle zone they are numerous,\r\nbut do not form a coherent sclerenchymatous ring as in cinnamon (p.\r\n526). The innermost part of the liber shares the structural character\r\nof cinnamon with differences due to age, as for instance the greater\r\ndevelopment of the medullary rays. Oil-cells and gum-ducts are likewise\r\ndistributed in the parenchyme of the former.\r\n\r\nThe “_China Cinnamon_” of 1870 (p. 530) comes still nearer to Ceylon\r\ncinnamon, except that it is coated. A transverse section of a quill,\r\nnot thicker than one millimetre, exhibits the three layers described\r\nas characterizing that bark. The sclerenchymatous ring is covered by a\r\nparenchyme rich in oil-ducts, so that it is obvious that the flavour\r\nof this drug could not be improved by scraping. The corky layer is\r\ncomposed of the usual tabular cells. The liber of this drug in fact\r\nagrees with that of Ceylon cinnamon.\r\n\r\nIn _Cassia Barks of considerable thickness_, the same arrangement of\r\ntissues is met with, but their strong development causes a certain\r\ndissimilarity. Thus the thick-walled cells are more and more separated\r\none from another, so as to form only small groups. The same applies\r\nalso to the liber-fibres, which in thick barks are surrounded by a\r\nparenchyme, loaded with considerable crystals of oxalate of calcium.\r\nThe gum-ducts are not larger, but are more numerous in these barks,\r\nwhich swell considerably in cold water.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Cassia bark owes its aromatic properties to an\r\nessential oil, which, in a chemical point of view, agrees with that of\r\nCeylon cinnamon. The flavour of cassia oil is somewhat less agreeable,\r\nand as it exists in the less valuable sorts of cassia, decidedly\r\ndifferent in aroma from that of cinnamon. We find the sp. gr. of a\r\nChinese cassia oil to be 1·066, and its rotatory power in a column\r\n50 mm. long, only 0°·1 to the right, differing consequently in this\r\nrespect from that of cinnamon oil (p. 526).\r\n\r\nOil of cassia sometimes deposits a stearoptene, which when purified is\r\na colourless, inodorous substance, crystallizing in shining brittle\r\nprisms.[1967] We have never met with it.\r\n\r\n[1967] Rochleder and Schwarz (1850) in Gmelin’s _Chemistry_, xvii. 395.\r\n\r\nIf thin sections of cassia bark are moistened with a dilate solution\r\nof perchloride of iron, the contents of the parenchymatous part of\r\nthe whole tissue assume a dingy brown colour; in the outer layers the\r\nstarch granules even are coloured. _Tannic matter_ is consequently one\r\nof the chief constituents of the bark; the very cell-walls are also\r\nimbued with it. A decoction of the bark is turned blackish-green by a\r\npersalt of iron.\r\n\r\nIf cassia bark (or Ceylon cinnamon) is exhausted by _cold water_,\r\nthe clear liquid becomes turbid on addition of iodine; the same\r\noccurs if a concentrated solution of iodide of potassium is added.\r\nAn abundant precipitate is produced by addition of iodine dissolved\r\nin the potassium salt. The colour of iodine then disappears. There\r\nis consequently a substance present which unites with iodine; and in\r\nfact, if to a _decoction_ of cassia or cinnamon the said solution of\r\niodine is added, it strikes a bright blue coloration, due to starch.\r\nBut the colour quickly disappears, and becomes permanent only after\r\nmuch of the test has been added. We have not ascertained the nature of\r\nthe substance that thus modifies the action of iodine: it can hardly\r\nbe tannic matter, as we have found the reaction to be the same when we\r\nused bark that had been previously repeatedly treated with spirit of\r\nwine and then several times with boiling ether.\r\n\r\nThe mucilage contained in the gum-cells of the thinner quills of cassia\r\nis easily dissolved by cold water, and may be precipitated together\r\nwith tannin by neutral acetate of lead, but not by alcohol. In the\r\nthicker barks it appears less soluble, merely swelling into a slimy\r\njelly.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Cassia lignea is exported from Canton in enormous and\r\nincreasing quantities. The shipments which in 1864 amounted to 13,800\r\npeculs, reached 40,600 in 1869,[1968] 61,220 in 1871, and 76,464 peculs\r\n(10,195,200 lb.) value £267,703, in 1872.[1969] In 1874 the exports\r\nwere 54,268 peculs (1 pecul = 133⅓ lb.) and 58,313 peculs in 1878; from\r\nthe other ports of China cassia is not shipped to any extent. England\r\nusually receives no more than about 1,000,000 lb. of cassia, of which\r\nonly 40,000 lb. appear to be consumed in the country. Hamburg imports\r\nabout 2,000,000 lb. annually immediately from China. Yet in 1878 the\r\nquantity imported into London was 26,744 peculs (3,500,000 lb.), that\r\nreceived at Hamburg 13,548 peculs.\r\n\r\nCassia lignea is exported in chests containing 2 peculs each.\r\n\r\n_Oil of cassia_ was shipped from the south of China to the United\r\nKingdom, to the extent in 1869 of 47,517 lb.; in 1870, of 28,389\r\nlb.[1970] Hamburg is also a very important place for this oil; in the\r\nofficial statistics of that port for 1875 the imports from China are\r\nstated to have amounted to 30,000 lb., besides 10,000 lb. imported from\r\nGreat Britain; in 1876 Hamburg imported 5,900 lb. from China and 17,000\r\nlb. from England.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The same as those of cinnamon.\r\n\r\n[1968] _Canton Trade Report_ for 1869.\r\n\r\n[1969] _Commercial Reports from H. M. Consuls in China_, presented to\r\nParliament 1873,—(Consul Robertson).\r\n\r\n[1970] _Annual Statement of the Trade and Navigation of the United\r\nKingdom for 1870._ 290.—66,650 were exported in 1877 from Pakhoi.\r\n\r\nAllied Products.\r\n\r\n_Cassia Twigs_—The branches of the cassia trees, alluded to at page\r\n529, would appear to be collected from the same trees which yield\r\nthe cassia lignea. Garnier (_l.c._ at p. 528) says that the youngest\r\nbranches are made into fagots, adding that they have the odour of bugs.\r\n\r\nCassia twigs are not as yet exported to Europe, but they constitute a\r\nvery important article of the trade of the interior of China. In 1872\r\nno less than 456,533 lb. of this _Wood of Cassia_ or _Cassia Twigs_\r\nwere shipped from Canton, for the most part to other Chinese ports.—The\r\nimports of Hankow, in 1874, of these twigs were 1925 peculs (259,667\r\nlb.) valued at 5677 taels (1 tael about equal to 5_s._ 11_d._).[1971]\r\n\r\nIn the Paris Exhibition of 1878 we had the opportunity of examining\r\nsome bundles of cassia twigs from western Kwangtung. The branches were\r\nas much as 2 feet in length and of the thickness of a finger. We found\r\ntheir bark to possess the usual flavour of cassia lignea.\r\n\r\n_Cassia Buds, Flores Cassiæ_—These are the _immature fruits_ of the\r\ntree yielding Chinese cassia lignea, and have been used in Europe since\r\nthe middle ages. In the journal of expenses (A.D. 1359-60) of John,\r\nking of France, when a prisoner at Somerton Castle in England, there\r\nare several entries for the spice under the name of _Flor de Canelle_;\r\nit was very expensive, costing from 8_s._ to 13_s._ per lb., or more\r\nthan double the price of mace or cloves. On one occasion two pounds\r\nof it had to be obtained for the king’s use from Bruges.[1972] From\r\nthe _Form of Cury_[1973] written in 1390, it appears that cassia buds\r\n(“_Flō de queynel_”) were used in preparing the spiced wine called\r\n_Hippocras_.\r\n\r\nCassia buds are shipped from Canton, but the exports have much\r\ndeclined. Rondot, writing in 1848,[1974] estimated them as averaging\r\n400 peculs (53,333 lb.) a year. In 1866 there were shipped from Canton\r\nonly 233 peculs (31,066 lb.); in 1867, 165 peculs (22,000 lb.)[1975]\r\nThe quantity of cassia buds imported into the United Kingdom in 1870\r\nwas 29,321 lb.;[1976] the spice is sold chiefly by grocers. The great\r\nmarket for this drug is Hamburg, where in 1876, according to the\r\nofficial statistics, 1324 cwt. of cassia buds were imported.\r\n\r\nIn Southern India, the more mature fruits of one of the varieties of\r\n_Cinnamomum iners_ Reinw. are collected for use, but are very inferior\r\nto the Chinese cassia buds.\r\n\r\n_Folia Malabathri_ or _Folia Indi_—is the name given to the dried,\r\naromatic leaves of certain Indian species of _Cinnamomum_, formerly\r\nemployed[1977] in European medicine, but now obsolete. Under the name\r\n_Taj-pat_, the leaves are still used in India; they are collected in\r\nMysore from wild trees.\r\n\r\n_Ishpingo_—This is the designation in Quito of the calyx of a tree of\r\nthe laurel tribe, used in Ecuador and Peru in the place of cinnamon.\r\nThough but little known in Europe, it has a remarkable history.\r\n\r\n[1971] _Returns of Trade at the Treaty Ports in China for 1872_, p. 34;\r\nfor 1874, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[1972] Doüet d’Arcq, _Comptes de l’Argenterie des Rois de France_,\r\n1851. 206. 218. 222. 239. etc.\r\n\r\n[1973] See p. 245, note 8.\r\n\r\n[1974] _Commerce d’exportation de la Chine_, 45.\r\n\r\n[1975] _Reports on Trade at the Treaty Ports in China for 1867_,\r\nShanghai, 1868. 49.\r\n\r\n[1976] _Annual Statement of the Trade and Navigation of the U.K. for\r\n1870._ 101.\r\n\r\n[1977] For further information consult Heyd, _Levantehandel_, ii.\r\n(1879) 663.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a spice-yielding region in South America, having come\r\nto the ears of the Spanish conquerors, was regarded as a matter of\r\ninterest. It would appear that cinnamon was enumerated in the earliest\r\naccounts among the precious products of the New World.[1978] Such high\r\nimportance was attached to it that in Ecuador an expedition was fitted\r\nout. The direction of the enterprise was confided to Gonzalo Pizarro,\r\nwho with 340 soldiers, and more than 4000 Indians, laden with supplies,\r\nquitted the city of Quito on Christmas Day, 1539. The expedition,\r\nwhich lasted two years, resulted in the most lamentable failure, only\r\n130 Spaniards surviving the hardships of the journey. In the account\r\nof it given by Garcilasso de la Vega, the cinnamon tree is described\r\nas having large leaves like those of a laurel, with fruits resembling\r\nacorns growing in clusters.[1979] Fernandez de Oviedo[1980] has also\r\ngiven some particulars regarding the spice, together with a figure\r\nfairly representing its remarkable form; and the subject has been\r\nnoticed by several other Spanish writers, including Monardes.[1981]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the celebrity thus conferred on the spice, and the fact\r\nthat the latter gives its name to a large tract of country,[1982] and\r\nis still the object of a considerable traffic, the tree itself is all\r\nbut unknown to science. Meissner places it doubtfully under the genus\r\nNectandra, with the specific name _cinnamomoides_, but confesses that\r\nits flowers and fruits are alike unknown.[1983]\r\n\r\nThe spice, for an ample specimen of which we have to thank Dr.\r\nDestruge, of Guayaquil, consists of the enlarged and matured woody\r\ncalyx, 1½ to 2 inches in diameter, having the shape of a shallow\r\nfunnel, the open part of which is a smooth cup (like the cup of an\r\nacorn), surrounded by a broad, irregular margin, usually recurved. The\r\nouter surface is rough and veiny, and the whole calyx is dark brown,\r\nand has a strong, sweet, aromatic taste, like cinnamon, for which in\r\nEcuador it is the common substitute.\r\n\r\nDr. Destruge has also furnished us with a specimen of the _bark_, which\r\nis in very small uncoated quills, exactly simulating true cinnamon. We\r\nare not aware whether the bark is thus prepared in quantity.\r\n\r\n[1978] Account of Petrus Martyr d’Angleria to Cardinal Ascanio Sforza,\r\nin Michael Herr’s _Die neue Welt_, etc., Strassburg, 1534. fol. 175.\r\n\r\n[1979] _Travels of Pedro de Cieza de Leon_, A.D. 1532-50, translated\r\nby Markham (Hakluyt Society) Lond. 1864. chap. 39-40; also _Expedition\r\nof Gonzalo Pizarro to the Land of Cinnamon_, by Garcilasso Inca de la\r\nVega, forming part of the same volume.\r\n\r\n[1980] _Historia de las Indias_, Madrid, i.

The forest of canelos, he tells us, has no definite\r\nboundaries; but the term is popularly assigned to all the upper region\r\nof the Pastasa and its tributaries, from a height of 4000 to 7000\r\nfeet on the slopes of the Andes, down to the Amazonian plain, and the\r\nconfluence of the Bombonasa and Pastasa.\r\n\r\n[1983] De Candolle, _Prodromus_, xv. sect. i. 167.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTEX BIBIRU.\r\n\r\n_Cortex Nectandræ_; _Greenheart Bark_, _Bibiru_ or _Bebeeru Bark_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Nectandra Rodiæi_ Schomburgk—The Bibiru or\r\nGreenheart is a large forest tree,[1984] growing on rocky soils\r\nin British Guiana, twenty to fifty miles inland. It is found in\r\nabundance on the hill sides which skirt the rivers Essequibo, Cuyuni,\r\nDemerara, Pomeroon and Berbice. The tree attains a height of 80 to 90\r\nfeet, with an undivided erect trunk, furnishing an excellent timber\r\nwhich is ranked in England as one of the eight first-class woods for\r\nshipbuilding, and is to be had in beams of from 60 to 70 feet long.\r\n\r\n=History=—In 1769 Bancroft, in his _History of Guiana_, called\r\nattention to the excellent timber afforded by the _Greenheart_ or\r\n_Sipeira_. About the year 1835 it became known that Hugh Rodie, a navy\r\nsurgeon who had settled in Demerara some twenty years previously, had\r\ndiscovered an alkaloid of considerable efficacy as a febrifuge, in the\r\nbark of this tree.[1985] In 1843 this alkaloid, to which Rodie had\r\ngiven the name _Bebeerine_, was examined by Dr. Douglas Maclagan; and\r\nthe following year the tree was described by Schomburgk under the name\r\nof _Nectandra Rodiæi_.[1986]\r\n\r\n=Description=—Greenheart bark occurs in long heavy flat pieces, not\r\nunfrequently 4 inches broad and ³/₁₀ of an inch thick, externally of a\r\nlight greyish brown, with the inner surface of a more uniform cinnamon\r\nhue and with strong longitudinal striæ. It is hard and brittle; the\r\nfracture coarse-grained, slightly foliaceous, and only fibrous in the\r\ninner layer. The grey suberous coat is always thin, often forming small\r\nwarts, and leaving when removed longitudinal depressions analogous\r\nto the _digital furrows_ of Flat Calisaya Bark (p. 353), but mostly\r\nlonger. Greenheart bark has a strong bitter taste, but is not aromatic.\r\nIts watery infusion is of a very pale cinnamon brown.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The general features of this bark are very\r\nuniform, almost the whole tissue having been changed into thick-walled\r\ncells. Even the cells of the corky layer show secondary deposits; the\r\nprimary envelope has entirely disappeared, and no transition from the\r\nsuberous coat to liber is obvious.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent forms of the tissue are the stone-cells and very\r\nshort liber-fibres, intersected by small medullary rays and crossed\r\ntransversely by parenchyme or small prosenchyme cells with walls a\r\nlittle less thickened, so as to appear in a transverse section as\r\nirregular squares or groups. The only cells of a peculiar character\r\nare the sharp-pointed fibres of the inner liber, which are curiously\r\nsaw-shaped, being provided with numerous protuberances and sinuosities.\r\n\r\n[1984] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen’s _Medic.

It was however shown by Walz in 1860 to be apparently\r\nidentical with _Buxine_, a substance discovered as early as 1830 in the\r\nbark and leaves of the Common Box, _Buxus sempervirens_ L. In 1869 the\r\nobservation of Walz was to some extent confirmed by one of us,[1987]\r\nwho further demonstrated that _Pelosine_, an alkaloid occurring in\r\nthe stems and roots of _Cissampelos Pareira_ L. and _Chondodendron\r\ntomentosum_ Ruiz et Pavon (p. 28), is undistinguishable from the\r\nalkaloids of greenheart and box.\r\n\r\nThe alkaloid of bibiru bark, which may be conveniently prepared from\r\nthe crude sulphate used in medicine under the name of _Sulphate of\r\nBibirine_, is a colourless amorphous substance, the composition of\r\nwhich is indicated by the formula C₁₈H₂₁NO₃. It is soluble in 5 parts\r\nof absolute alcohol, in 13 of ether, and in 1400 (1800, Walz) of\r\nboiling water, the solution in each case having a decidedly alkaline\r\nreaction on litmus. It dissolves readily in bisulphide of carbon, as\r\nwell as in dilute acids. The salts hitherto known are uncrystallizable.\r\nThe solution of a neutral acetate affords an abundant white precipitate\r\non the addition of an alkaline phosphate, nitrate or iodide, of\r\niodohydrargyrate or platino-cyanide of potassium, perchloride of\r\nmercury, or of nitric or iodic acid.\r\n\r\nMaclagan, one of the earliest investigators of greenheart, has\r\nobtained in co-operation with Gamgee[1988] certain alkaloids from the\r\n_wood_ of the tree, to one of which these chemists have assigned the\r\nformula C₂₀H₂₃NO₄ and the name _Nectandria_. Two other alkaloids, the\r\ncharacters of which have not yet been fully investigated, are stated to\r\nhave been obtained from the same source.\r\n\r\n_Bibiric Acid_, which Maclagan obtained from the _seeds_, is described\r\nas a colourless, crystalline, deliquescent substance, fusing at 150° C.\r\nand volatile at 200° C., then forming needle-shaped groups.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The supplies of greenheart bark are extremely uncertain, and\r\nthe drug is scarcely to be found in the market. It has been imported in\r\nbarrels containing 80 to 84 lb. each, or in bags holding ½ to ¾ cwt.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The bark has been recommended as a bitter tonic and febrifuge,\r\nbut is hardly ever employed except in the form of what is called\r\n_Sulphate of Bibirine_, which, as we have said, is _crude Sulphate of\r\nBuxine_.[1989] It is a dark amorphous substance which, having while\r\nin a syrupy state been spread out on glazed plates, is obtained in\r\nthin translucent laminæ. We find it to yield scarcely one-third of its\r\nweight of the pure alkaloid.\r\n\r\n[1987] Flückiger, _Neues Jahrbuch für Pharmacie_, xxxi. (1869) 257;\r\n_Pharm. Journ._ xi.

In the north it is only a shrub, or a small tree 20 to 30\r\nfeet high, but in the Middle and Southern United States, and especially\r\nin Virginia and Carolina, it attains a height of 40 to 100 feet. The\r\nleaves are of different forms, some being ovate and entire, and others\r\ntwo- or three-lobed, the former, it is said, appearing earlier than the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n=History=—Monardes relates that the French during their expedition\r\nto Florida (1562-1564) cured their sick with the wood and root of a\r\ntree called _Sassafras_, the use of which they had learnt from the\r\nIndians.[1990] Laudonnière, who was a member of that expedition, and\r\ndiligently set forth the wonders of Florida, observes that, among\r\nforest trees, the most remarkable for its timber and especially for its\r\nfragrant bark, is that called by the savages _Pavame_ and by the French\r\n_Sassafras_.[1991]\r\n\r\nThe drug was known in Germany, at least since 1582, under the\r\nabove names or also by that of _Lignum Floridum_ or _Fennel-wood_,\r\n_Xylomarathrum_.[1992]\r\n\r\nThe sassafras tree had been introduced into England in the time of\r\nGerarde (_circa_ 1597), who speaks of a specimen growing at Bow. At\r\nthat period the wood and bark of the root were used chiefly in the\r\ntreatment of ague.\r\n\r\nIn 1610, a paper of instructions from the Government of England to\r\nthat of the new colony of Virginia, mentions among commodities to be\r\nsent home, “_Small sassafras Rootes_” which are “to be drawen in the\r\nwinter and dryed and none to be medled with in the somer;—and yet is\r\nworthe £50 and better per tonne.”[1993] The shipments were afterwards\r\nmuch overdone, for in 1622 complaint is made that other things than\r\n_tobacco_ and _sassafras_[1994] were neglected to be shipped.\r\n\r\nAngelus Sala, an Italian chemist living in Germany about the year\r\n1610-1630, in distilling sassafras noticed that the oil was heavier\r\nthan water;[1995] it was quoted in 1683 in the tariff of the apothecary\r\nof the elector of Saxony, at Dresden.[1996] John Maud in 1738 obtained\r\ncrystals of safrol as long as 4 inches;[1997] in 1844 they were\r\nexamined by Saint-Evre.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Sassafras is imported in large branching logs, which\r\noften include the lower portion of the stem, 6 to 12 inches in\r\ndiameter.[1998]\r\n\r\n[1990] _Historia medicinal de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias\r\noccidentales_, (Sevilla, 1574) 51.\r\n\r\n[1991] De Laet, _Novus Orbis_, 1633. 215.—René de Laudonnière,\r\n_Histoire notable de la Floride_. 1586.\r\n\r\n[1992] _Pharm.

No. 4.\r\n\r\n[1995] _Opera medico-chymica_, Francofurti, 1682, p. 83.\r\n\r\n[1996] Flückiger, _Documente_ (quoted at p. 404, note 7) 70.\r\n\r\n[1997] _Phil. Trans. R. Soc. of London_, viii. (1809) 243.\r\n\r\n[1998] The sassafras logs met with in English trade often include a\r\nconsiderable portion of trunk-wood, which, as well as the bark that\r\ncovers it, is inert, and should be sawn off and rejected before the\r\nwood is rasped.\r\n\r\nThe roots proper, which diminish in size down to the thickness of a\r\nquill, are covered with a dull, rough, spongy bark. This bark has\r\nan inert, soft corky layer, beneath which is a firmer inner bark of\r\nbrighter hue, rich in essential oil. The wood of the root is light and\r\neasily cut, in colour of a dull reddish-brown, and with a fragrant\r\nodour and spicy taste similar to that of the bark but less strong. It\r\nis usually sold in the shops rasped into shavings.\r\n\r\nThe _bark of the root_ (_Cortex sassafras_) is a separate article of\r\ncommerce, but not much used in England. It consists of channelled,\r\nflattish, or curled, irregular fragments seldom exceeding 4 inches\r\nlong by 3 inches broad and generally much smaller, and from ¹/₁₆ to\r\n¼ of an inch in thickness. The inert outer layer has been carefully\r\nremoved, leaving a scarred, exfoliating surface. The inner surface\r\nis finely striated and exhibits very minute shining crystals. The\r\nbark has a short, corky fracture, and in colour is a bright cinnamon\r\nbrown of various shades. It has a strong and agreeable smell, with an\r\nastringent, aromatic, bitterish taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The wood of the root exhibits, in transverse\r\nsection, concentric rings transversed by narrow medullary rays. Each\r\nring contains a number of large vessels in its inner part, and more\r\ndensely packed cells in its outer. The prevailing part of the wood\r\nconsists of prosenchyme cells. Globular cells, loaded with yellow\r\nessential oil, are distributed among the woody prosenchyme. The latter\r\nas well as the medullary rays abounds in starch.\r\n\r\nThe _bark_ is rich in oil-cells and also contains cells filled with\r\nmucilage; it owes its spongy appearance and exfoliation to the\r\nformation of secondary cork bands (_rhytidoma_) within the mesophlœum\r\nand even in the liber. The cortical tissue abounds in red colouring\r\nmatter, and further contains starch and, less abundantly, oxalate of\r\ncalcium.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The wood of the root yields 1 to 2 per cent.\r\nof volatile oil,[1999] and the root-bark twice as much. The stem and\r\nleaves of the tree contain but a very small quantity. The oil, which\r\nas found in commerce is all manufactured in America, has the specific\r\nodour of sassafras, and is colourless, yellow, or reddish-brown,\r\naccording, as the distillers assert, to the character of the root\r\nemployed. As the colour of the oil does not affect its flavour and\r\nmarket value, no effort is made to keep separate the different\r\nvarieties of root.\r\n\r\nOil of Sassafras has a sp. gr. of 1·087 to 1·094, increasing somewhat\r\nby age (Procter). When cooled, it deposits crystals of _Safrol_ or\r\n_Sassafras Camphor_. This body, which we obtained in the form of hard,\r\nfour- or six-sided prisms with the odour of sassafras, often attaining\r\nmore than 4 inches in length and 1 inch in diameter, belongs to the\r\nmonosymmetric system, as shown by Arzruni.[2000] Safrol, C₁₀H₁₀O₂,\r\nliquefies at 8°·5 C. (47° F.), having at 12° C. a sp. gr. of 1·11; it\r\nboils at 232° C., and is devoid of rotatory power, nor is it soluble in\r\nalkalis. The researches of Grimaux and Ruotte (1869) show the oil to\r\ncontain nine-tenths of its weight of _Safrol_ which they observed only\r\nin the liquid state.\r\n\r\n[1999] According to information obtained by Procter, 11 bushels of\r\nchips (the charge of a still) yields from 1 to 5 lb. of oil, the amount\r\nvarying with the quality of the root and the proportion of bark it\r\nmay contain.—Procter, _Essay on Sassafras in the Proceedings of the\r\nAmerican Pharm. Association_, 1866. 217.\r\n\r\n[2000] Poggendorff’s _Annalen_, clviii. (1876) 249, with figures of the\r\ncrystals.\r\n\r\nAnother constituent of sassafras oil has been termed by Grimaux and\r\nRuotte _Safrene_; it boils at 155° to 157° C., has a sp. gr. of 0·834\r\nand the formula C₁₀H₁₆. It has the same odour as safrol, but deviates\r\nthe plane of polarization to the right.\r\n\r\nIt was further found by the same observers that the crude oil contains\r\nan extremely small quantity of a substance of the phenol class, which\r\ncan be removed by caustic lye and separated by an acid.\r\n\r\nWe succeeded in obtaining this substance by using that portion of the\r\ncrude oil from which the safrol had separated. The phenol remains in\r\nthe mother-liquor after it has again been cooled and has afforded a new\r\ncrystallization of safrol. The phenol thus obtained assumes a beautiful\r\ngreenish blue hue on addition of an alcoholic solution of perchloride\r\nof iron.\r\n\r\nThe _Sassarubin_ and _Sassafrin_ of Hare (1837) are impure products of\r\nthe decomposition of sassafras oil by means of sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nThe _bark_ and also to some extent the _wood_, in both cases of the\r\nroot, contain tannic acid which produces a blue colour with persalts\r\nof iron. By oxidation, we must suppose, it is converted into the red\r\ncolouring matter deposited in the bark and, in smaller quantity, in\r\nthe heartwood of old trees. The young wood is nearly white. The said\r\nred substance probably agrees with that to which Reinsch in 1845 and\r\n1846 gave the name of _Sassafrid_, and is doubtless analogous to\r\ncinchona-red and ratanhia-red. Reinsch obtained it to the extent of 9·2\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—Baltimore is the chief mart for sassafras\r\nroot, bark and oil, which are brought thither from within a circuit\r\nof 300 miles. The roots are extracted from the ground by the help of\r\nlevers, partly barked and partly sent untouched to the market, or are\r\ncut up into chips for distillation on the spot. Of the bark as much as\r\n100,000 lb. were received in Baltimore in 1866. The quantity of oil\r\nannually produced previous to the war is estimated at 15,000 to 20,000\r\nlb. There are isolated small distillers in Pennsylvania and West New\r\nJersey, who are allowed by the owners of a “_sassafras wilderness_” to\r\nremove from the ground the roots and stumps without charge. Sassafras\r\nroot is not medicinal in the United States, the more aromatic root-bark\r\nbeing reasonably preferred.[2001]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Sassafras is reputed to be sudorific and stimulant, but in\r\nBritish practice it is only given in combination with sarsaparilla and\r\nguaiacum. Shavings of the wood are sold to make _Sassafras Tea_.\r\n\r\nIn America the essential oil is used to give a pleasant flavour to\r\neffervescing drinks, tobacco and toilet soaps.[2002]\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—The odour of sassafras is common to several plants of the\r\norder _Lauraceæ_. Thus the bark of _Mesphilodaphne Sassafras_ Meissn.,\r\na tree of Brazil, resembles in odour true sassafras. We have seen a\r\nvery thick sassafras bark brought from India, the same we suppose as\r\nthat which Mason[2003] describes as abundantly produced in Burma.\r\n\r\nThe bark of _Atherosperma moschatum_ Labillardière, an Australian tree,\r\nis occasionally exported from Australia under the name of Sassafras\r\nbark. It has the odour of the true drug, but differs from it by its\r\ngrey colour.\r\n\r\n[2001] Besides this, _the pith of sassafras_ is also there used as a\r\npopular remedy; it is entirely devoid of odour and taste, and is very\r\nslightly mucilaginous.\r\n\r\n[2002] _American Journ. of Pharm._ 1871. 470.\r\n\r\n[2003] _Burmah, its people and natural productions_, 1860. 497.\r\n\r\nThe large separate cotyledons of two lauraceous trees of the Rio Negro,\r\ndoubtfully referred by Meissner to the genus _Nectandra_, furnish the\r\nso-called _Sassafras Nuts_ or _Puchury_ or _Pilchurim Beans_ of Brazil,\r\noccasionally to be met with in old drug warehouses.\r\n\r\nOn the Orinoko and in Guiana an oleo-resin, called _Sassafras Oil_\r\nor _Laurel Oil_, is obtained by boring into the stem of _Oreodaphne\r\nopifera_ Nees, which sometimes contains a cavity holding a large\r\nquantity of this fluid.[2004] A similar oil (_Aceite de Sassafras_) is\r\nafforded on the Rio Negro by _Nectandra Cymbarum_ Nees.[2005]\r\n\r\n[2004] _Brit.

The flowers are succeeded by red berries. It is a\r\nnative of the hilly parts of almost the whole of Europe, from Italy\r\nto the Arctic regions, and extends eastward to Siberia. In Britain it\r\noccurs here and there in a few of the southern and midland counties,\r\nand even reaches Yorkshire and Westmoreland, but there is reason to\r\nthink it is not truly indigenous. Gerarde, who was well acquainted with\r\nit, did not regard it as a British plant.\r\n\r\n=History=—The Arabian physicians used a plant called _Mázariyún_,\r\nthe effects of which they compared to those of euphorbium; it was\r\nprobably a species of _Daphne_. The word _mázariyún_ is, we are told by\r\ncompetent Arabic scholars, not of Arabic origin, but in all probability\r\nderived from the Greek idiom, in which however we are unable to trace\r\nits origin. _D. Mezereum_ was known to the early botanists of Europe,\r\nas _Daphnoides Chamælæa_, _Thymelæa_, _Chamædaphne_. Tragus described\r\nit and figured it in 1546 under the name of _Mezereum Germanicum_. The\r\nbark had a place in the German pharmacy of the 17th century under the\r\nname of cortex _Coccognidii_ s. _Mezerei_; the berries were the _Cocca\r\ngnidia_ s. _knidia_ of the old pharmacy.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Mezereon has a very tough and fibrous bark easily\r\nremoved in long strips which curl inwards as they dry; it is collected\r\nin winter and made up into rolls or bundles. The bark, which rarely\r\nexceeds ¹/₂₀ of an inch in thickness, has an internal greyish or\r\nreddish-brown corky coat which is easily separable from a green inner\r\nlayer, white and satiny on the side next the wood. That of younger\r\nbranches is marked with prominent leaf-scars. The bark is too tough to\r\nbe broken, but easily tears into fibrous strips. When fresh, it has an\r\nunpleasant odour which is lost in drying; its taste is persistently\r\nburning and acrid. Applied in a moist state to the skin, it occasions,\r\nafter some hours, redness and even vesication.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The cambial zone is formed of about ten rows\r\nof delicate unequal cells. The libre consists chiefly of simple fibres\r\nalternating with parenchymatous bundles, and traversed by medullary\r\nrays. The fibres are very long,—frequently more than 3 mm., and from 5\r\nto 10 mkm. in diameter, their walls being always but little thickened.\r\nIn the outer part of the liber there occur bundles of thick-walled\r\nbast-tubes, while chlorophyll and starch granules appear generally\r\nthroughout the middle cortical layer. The suberous coat is made up of\r\nabout 30 dense rows of thin-walled tabular cells, which examined in\r\na tangential section, have an hexagonal outline. Small quantities of\r\ntannic matter are deposited in the cambial and suberous zones.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The acrid principle of mezereon is a resinoid\r\nsubstance contained in the inner bark; it has not yet been examined.\r\nThe fruits were found by Martius (1862) to contain more than 40 per\r\ncent. of a fatty, vesicating oil, which appears to be likewise present\r\nin the bark.\r\n\r\nThe name _Daphnin_ has been given to a crystallizable substance\r\nobtained by Vauquelin in 1808 from _Daphne alpina_, and afterwards\r\nfound by C. G. Gmelin and Baer in the bark of _D. Mezereum_. Zwenger\r\nin 1860 ascertained it to be a glucoside of bitter taste, having\r\nthe composition C₁₅H₁₆O₉ + 2 OH₂, the same as that of Æsculin, the\r\nfluorescing principle occurring in the bark of _Æsculus Hippocastanum_\r\nand the root-bark of _Gelsemium nitidum_ Michaux (_G. sempervirens_\r\nAiton).—_Coccognin_, isolated in 1870 by Casselmann from the fruits of\r\n_D. Mezereum_, appears to be closely allied to if not identical with\r\ndaphnin.\r\n\r\nWhen daphnin is boiled with dilute hydrochloric or sulphuric acid,\r\nit furnishes _Daphnetin_, C₉H₆O₄ + OH₂, described by Zwenger as\r\ncrystallizing in colourless prisms. By dry distillation of an alcoholic\r\nextract of mezereon bark, the same chemist obtained _Umbelliferone_ (p.\r\n322).\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Mezereon taken internally is supposed to be alterative and\r\nsudorific, and useful in venereal, rheumatic and scrofulous complaints;\r\nbut in English medicine it is never now given except as an ingredient\r\nof the Compound Decoction of Sarsaparilla. An ethereal extract of\r\nthe bark has been introduced (1867) as an ingredient of a powerful\r\nstimulating liniment. On the Continent, the bark itself, soaked in\r\nvinegar and water, is applied with a bandage as a vesicant.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—Owing to the difficulty of procuring the bark of the\r\nroot of _D. Mezereum_, the herbalists who supply the London druggists\r\nhave been long in the habit of substituting that of _D. Laureola_ L.,\r\nan evergreen species, not uncommon in woods and hedge-sides in several\r\nparts of England. The _British Pharmacopœia_ (1864 and 1867) permits\r\n_Cortex Mezerei_ to be obtained indiscriminately from either of these\r\nspecies, and does not follow the London College in insisting on the\r\n_bark of the root_ alone. That of the stem of _D. Laureola_ corresponds\r\nin structure with the bark of the true mezereon, but wants the\r\nprominent leaf-scars that mark the upper branches of the latter; it is\r\nreputed to be somewhat less acrid than mezereon bark. The mezereon bark\r\nof English trade is now mostly imported from Germany, and seems to be\r\nderived from _D. Mezereum_.\r\n\r\nIn France, use is made of the stem-bark of _D. Gnidium_ L., a\r\nshrub growing throughout the whole Mediterranean region as far as\r\nMorocco. The bark is dark grey or brown, marked with numerous whitish\r\nleaf-scars, which display a very regular spiral arrangement. The leaves\r\nthemselves, some of which are occasionally met with in the drug, are\r\nsharply mucronate and very narrow. As to structural peculiarities,\r\nthe bark of _D. Gnidium_ has the medullary rays more obvious and more\r\nloaded with tannic matters than those of _D. Mezereum_; but the middle\r\ncortical layer is less developed. The bark, which is called _Ecorce de\r\nGaoru_, is employed as an epispastic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOCARPACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARICÆ.\r\n\r\n_Fructus Caricæ_, _Fici_; _Figs_; F. _Figues_; G. _Feigen_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Ficus Carica_ L., a deciduous tree, 15 to 20 feet\r\nin height, with large rough leaves, forming a handsome mass of foliage.\r\n\r\nThe native country of the fig stretches from the steppes of the Eastern\r\nAral, along the south and south-west coast of the Caspian Sea (Ghilan,\r\nMazanderan, and the Caucasus), through Kurdistan, to Asia Minor and\r\nSyria. In these countries the fig-tree ascends into the mountain\r\nregion, growing undoubtedly wild in the Taurus at an elevation of 4,800\r\nfeet.[2006]\r\n\r\nThe fig-tree is repeatedly mentioned in the Scriptures, where with the\r\nvine it often stands as the symbol of peace and plenty. The fig was\r\nnot known in Greece, the Archipelago, and the neighbouring coasts of\r\nAsia Minor during the Homeric age, though both were very common in the\r\ntime of Plato. The fig-tree was early introduced into Italy, whence it\r\nreached Spain and Gaul. In the opinion of palæontologists the fig-tree\r\nwas originally indigenous to the last named Mediterranean regions.\r\n\r\nCharlemagne, A.D. 812, ordered its cultivation in Central Europe.\r\nIt was brought to England in the reign of Henry VIII. by Cardinal\r\nPole, whose trees still exist in the garden of Lambeth Palace. But\r\nit had certainly been in cultivation at a much earlier period, for\r\nthe historian Matthew Paris relates[2007] that the year 1257 was so\r\ninclement that apples and pears were scarce in England, and that\r\n_figs_, cherries, and plums totally failed to ripen.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the fig-tree is found cultivated in most of the\r\ntemperate countries both of the Old and New World.[2008] It is met with\r\nin the plains of north-western India, and in the outer hills of the\r\nnorth-western Himalaya as high as 5,000 feet; also in the Dekkan, and\r\nin Beluchistan and Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n[2006] Ritter, _Erdkunde von Asien_, vii.

(1854) 255.\r\n\r\n[2008] Introduced into Mexico by Cortez about A.D. 1560.\r\n\r\n=History=—Figs were a valued article of food among the ancient\r\nHebrews[2009] and Greeks, as they are to the present day in the warmer\r\ncountries bordering the Mediterranean.[2010] In the time of Pliny many\r\nvarieties were in cultivation. The Latin word _Carica_ was first used\r\nto designate the dried fig of Caria, a strip of country in Asia Minor\r\nopposite Rhodes, an esteemed variety of the fruit corresponding to the\r\nSmyrna fig of modern times.\r\n\r\nIn a diploma granted by Chilperic II., king of the Franks, to the\r\nmonastery of Corbie, A.D. 716, mention is made of “_Karigas_” in\r\nconnection with dates, almonds and olives, by which we think dried figs\r\n(_Caricæ_) were intended.[2011] Dried figs were a regular article of\r\ntrade during the middle ages, from the southern to the northern parts\r\nof Europe. In 1380 the citizens of Bruges, in regulating the duties\r\nwhich the “Lombards,” _i.e._ Italians, had to pay for their imports,\r\nquoted also figs from Cyprus and from Marbella, a place south-west of\r\nMalaga.[2012]\r\n\r\nIn England the average price between A.D. 1264 and 1398 was about\r\n1¾_d._ per lb., raisins and currants being 2¾_d._[2013]\r\n\r\n=Description=—A fig consists of a thick, fleshy, hollow receptacle\r\nof a pear-shaped form, on the inner face of which grow a multitude\r\nof minute fruits.[2014] This receptacle, which is provided with an\r\norifice at the top, is at first green, tough and leathery, exuding when\r\npricked a milky juice. The orifice is surrounded, and almost closed by\r\na number of thick, fleshy scales, near which and within the fig, the\r\nmale flowers are situated, but they are often wanting or are not fully\r\ndeveloped. The female flowers stand further within the receptacle, in\r\nthe body of which they are closely packed; they are stalked, have a\r\n5-leafed perianth and a bipartite stigma. The ovary, which is generally\r\none-celled, becomes when ripe a minute, dry, hard nut, popularly\r\nregarded as a seed.\r\n\r\n[2009] See in particular 1 Sam. xxv. 18 and 1 Chron. xii. 40; where\r\nwe read of large supplies of dried figs being provided for the use of\r\nfighting men. Also Num. xx. 5; Jer. xxiv. 2; 2 Reg. xx. 7.\r\n\r\n[2010] On the Riviera of Genoa dried figs eaten with bread are a common\r\nwinter food of the peasantry.\r\n\r\n[2011] Pardessus, _Diplomata_, _Chartæ_, etc., ii. (1849) 309.\r\n\r\n[2012] _Recesse und andere Akten der Hansetage_, ii. (Leipzig, 1872)\r\n235.\r\n\r\n[2013] Rogers, _Hist. of Agriculture and Prices in England_, i. (1866)\r\n632.\r\n\r\n[2014] Albertus Magnus, in allusion to the peculiar growth of the fig,\r\nremarks that the tree “fructum autem profert sine flore.” Page 386 of\r\nthe work quoted in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nAs the fig advances to maturity, the receptacle enlarges, becomes\r\nsofter and more juicy, a saccharine fluid replacing the acrid milky\r\nsap. It also acquires a reddish hue, while its exterior becomes purple,\r\nbrown, or yellow, though in some varieties it continues green. The\r\nfresh fig has an agreeable and extremely saccharine taste, but it wants\r\nthe juiciness and refreshing acidity that characterize many other\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nIf fig is not gathered its stalk loses its firmness, the fruit hangs\r\npendulous from the branch, begins to shrivel and become more and\r\nmore saccharine by loss of water, and ultimately, if the climate is\r\nfavourable, it assumes the condition of a _dried fig_. On the large\r\nscale however, figs are not dried on the tree, but are gathered and\r\nexposed to the sun and air in light trays till they acquire the proper\r\ndegree of dryness. They can only be preserved in those regions where\r\nthe summer and autumn are very warm and dry.\r\n\r\nDried figs are termed by the dealers either _natural_ or _pulled_. The\r\nfirst are those which have not been compressed in the packing, and\r\nstill retain their original shape.[2015] The second are those which\r\nafter drying have been made supple by squeezing and kneading, and in\r\nthat state packed with pressure into drums and boxes.\r\n\r\nSmyrna figs, which are the most esteemed sort, are of the latter kind.\r\nThey are of irregular, flattened form, tough, translucent, covered\r\nwith a saccharine efflorescence; they have a pleasant fruity smell and\r\nluscious taste. Figs of inferior quality, as those called in the market\r\n_Greek Figs_, differ chiefly in being smaller and less pulpy.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The outer layer of a dried fig is made up of\r\nsmall, thick-walled and densely packed cells, so as to form a kind\r\nof skin. The inner lax parenchyme consists of larger thin-walled\r\ncells, traversed by vascular bundles and large, slightly branched,\r\nlaticiferous vessels. The latter contain a granular substance not\r\nsoluble in water. In the parenchyme, stellate crystals of oxalate of\r\ncalcium occur, but in no considerable number.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The chemical changes which take place in the fig\r\nduring maturation are important, but no researches have yet been made\r\nfor their elucidation. The chief chemical substance in the ripe fig is\r\ngrape sugar, which constitutes from 60 to 70 per cent. of the dried\r\nfruit. Gum and fatty matter appear to be present only in very small\r\nquantity. We have observed that unripe figs are rich in starch.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—Dried figs were imported into the United\r\nKingdom in 1872 to the amount of 141,847 cwt., of which 91,721 cwt.\r\nwere shipped from Asiatic Turkey, the remainder being from Portugal,\r\nSpain, the Austrian territories and other countries. In 1876 the\r\nimports were 163,763 cwt., valued at £318,717.\r\n\r\nKalamata, in the Gulf of Messenia, Greece, and Cosenza in the Italian\r\nprovince of Calabria citeriore, are also particularly known as\r\nsupplying figs to some parts of continental Europe. In 1876 the exports\r\nof Kalamata to Trieste were 9½ millions of kilogrammes.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Dried figs are thought to be slightly laxative, and as such are\r\noccasionally recommended in habitual constipation. They enter into the\r\ncomposition of _Confectio Sennæ_.\r\n\r\n[2015] The word _Eleme_ applied in the London shops to dried figs of\r\nsuperior quality (“Eleme Figs”) is probably a corruption of the Turkish\r\n_ellémé_, signifying _hand-picked_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS MORI.\r\n\r\n_Baccæ Mori_, _Mora_; _Mulberries_; F. _Mûres_; G. _Maulbeeren_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Morus nigra_ L., a handsome bushy tree, about 30\r\nfeet in height, growing wild in Northern Asia Minor, Armenia, and the\r\nsouthern Caucasian regions as far as Persia. In Italy, it was employed\r\nfor feeding the silkworm until about the year 1434, when _M. alba_ L.\r\nwas introduced from the Levant,[2016] and has ever since been commonly\r\npreferred. Yet in Greece, in many of the Greek islands, Calabria and\r\nCorsica, the species planted for the silkworm is still _M. nigra_.\r\n\r\nThe mulberry tree is now cultivated throughout Europe, yet, excepting\r\nin the regions named, by no means abundantly. It ripens its fruit in\r\nEngland, as well as in Southern Sweden and Gottland, and in Christiania\r\n(Schübeler).\r\n\r\n=History=—The mulberry tree is mentioned in the Old Testament,[2017]\r\nand by most of the early Greek and Roman writers. Among the large\r\nnumber of useful plants ordered by Charlemagne (A.D. 812) to be\r\ncultivated on the imperial farms, the mulberry tree (_Morarius_) did\r\nnot escape notice.[2018] We meet with it also in a plan sketched A.D.\r\n820, for the gardens of the monastery of St. Gall in Switzerland.[2019]\r\nThe cultivation of the mulberry in Spain is implied by a reference\r\nto the preparation of _Syrup of Mulberries_ in the Calendar of\r\nCordova,[2020] which dates from the year 961.\r\n\r\nA curious reference to mulberries, proving them to have been far more\r\nesteemed in ancient times than at present, occurs in the statutes\r\nof the abbey of Corbie of Normandy, in which we find a _Brevis de\r\nMelle_, showing how much _honey_ the tenants of the monastic lands were\r\nrequired to pay annually, followed by a statement of the quantity of\r\n_Mulberries_ which each farm was expected to supply.[2021]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The tree bears unisexual catkins; the female, of an ovoid\r\nform, consists of numerous flowers with green four-lobed perianths and\r\ntwo linear stigmas. The lobes of the perianth overlapping each other\r\nbecome fleshy, and by their lateral aggregation form the spurious\r\nberry, which is shortly stalked, oblong, an inch in length, and, when\r\nripe, of an intense purple. By detaching a single fruit, the lobes of\r\nthe former perianth may be still discerned. Each fruit encloses a hard\r\nlenticular nucule, covering a pendulous seed with curved embryo and\r\nfleshy albumen.\r\n\r\nMulberries are extremely juicy and have a refreshing, subacid,\r\nsaccharine taste; but they are devoid of the fine aroma that\r\ndistinguishes many fruits of the order _Rosaceæ_.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—In an analysis made by H. van Hees (1857) 100\r\nparts of mulberries yielded the following constituents:—\r\n\r\n    Glucose and uncrystallizable sugar                       9·19\r\n    Free acid (supposed to be _malic_)                       1·86\r\n    Albuminous matter                                        0·39\r\n    Pectic matter, fat, salts, and gum                       2·03\r\n    Ash                                                      0·57\r\n    Insoluble matters (the seeds, pectose, cellulose, &c.)   1·25\r\n    Water                                                   84·71\r\n\r\n[2016] A.

The small proportion of insoluble matters is worthy of\r\nnotice in comparison, for instance with the whortleberry, which\r\ncontains no less than 13 per cent. The colouring matter of the mulberry\r\nhas not been examined. The acid is probably not simply malic, but in\r\npart tartaric.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The sole use in medicine of mulberries is for the preparation\r\nof a syrup employed to flavour or colour any other medicines. In\r\nGreece, the fruit is submitted to fermentation, thereby furnishing an\r\ninebriating beverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNABINEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBA CANNABIS.\r\n\r\n_Cannabis Indica_; _Indian Hemp_; F. _Chanvre Indien_; G. _Hanfkraut_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Cannabis sativa_ L., Common Hemp, an annual\r\ndiœcious plant, native of Western and Central Asia, cultivated in\r\ntemperate as well as in tropical countries.\r\n\r\nIt grows wild luxuriantly on the banks of the lower Ural and Volga\r\nnear the Caspian Sea, extending thence to Persia, the Altai range, and\r\nNorthern and Western China. It is found in Kashmir and on the Himalaya,\r\ngrowing 10 to 12 feet high, and thriving vigorously at an elevation\r\nof 6000 to 10,000 feet. It likewise occurs in Tropical Africa, on the\r\neastern and western coasts as well as in the central tracts watered\r\nby the Congo and Zambesi, but whether truly indigenous is doubtful.\r\nIt has been naturalized in Brazil, north of Rio de Janeiro, the seeds\r\nhaving been brought thither by the negroes from Western Africa. The\r\ncultivation of hemp is carried on in many parts of continental Europe,\r\nbut especially in Central and Southern Russia.\r\n\r\nThe hemp plant grown in India exhibits certain differences as\r\ncontrasted with that cultivated in Europe, which were noticed by\r\nRumphius in the 17th century, and which (about A.D. 1790), induced\r\nLamarck to claim for the former plant the rank of a distinct species,\r\nunder the name of _Cannabis indica_. But the variations observed in the\r\ntwo plants are of so little botanical importance and are so inconstant,\r\nthat the maintenance of _C. indica_ as distinct from _C. sativa_ has\r\nbeen abandoned by general consent.\r\n\r\n[2022] The fig excepted, which is much more saccharine than any.\r\n\r\nIn a medicinal point of view, there is a wide dissimilarity between\r\nhemp grown in India and that produced in Europe, the former being\r\nvastly more potent. Yet even in India there is much variation, for,\r\naccording to Jameson, the plant grown at altitudes of 6000 to 8000 feet\r\naffords the resin known as _Charas_, which cannot be obtained from that\r\ncultivated on the plains.[2023]\r\n\r\n=History=—Hemp has been propagated on account of its textile fibre and\r\noily seeds from a remote period.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Chinese herbal called _Rh-ya_, written about the 5th\r\ncentury B.C., notices the fact that the hemp plant is of two kinds, the\r\none producing seeds, the other flowers only.[2024] In Susruta, Charaka\r\nand other early works on Hindu medicine, hemp (_B’hanga_) is mentioned\r\nas a remedy. Herodotus states that hemp grows in Scythia both wild and\r\ncultivated, and that the Thracians made garments from it which can\r\nhardly be distinguished from linen. He also describes how the Scythians\r\nexpose themselves as in a bath to the vapour of the seeds thrown on hot\r\ncoals.[2025]\r\n\r\nThe Greeks and Romans appear to have been unacquainted with the\r\nmedicinal powers of hemp, unless indeed the care-destroying Νηπενθές\r\nshould, as Royle has supposed, be referred to this plant. According to\r\nStanislas Julien,[2026] anæsthetic powers were ascribed by the Chinese\r\nto preparations of hemp as early as the commencement of the 3rd century.\r\n\r\nThe employment of hemp both medical and dietetic appears to have spread\r\nslowly through India and Persia to the Arabians, amongst whom the\r\nplant was used in the early middle ages. The famous heretical sect of\r\nMahomedans, whose murderous deeds struck terror into the hearts of the\r\nCrusaders during the 11th and 12th centuries, derived their name of\r\n_Hashishin_, or, as it is commonly written, _assassins_, from _hashísh_\r\nthe Arabic for _hemp_,[2027] which in certain of their rites they used\r\nas an intoxicant.[2028] In 1286 of our era, the Sultan of Egypt, Bibars\r\nal Bondokdary, prohibited the sale of hashish, the monopoly of which\r\nhad been leased before.[2029]\r\n\r\nThe use of hemp (_bhang_) in India was particularly noticed by Garcia\r\nde Orta[2030] (1563), and the plant was subsequently figured by Rheede,\r\nwho described the drug as largely used on the Malabar coast. It would\r\nseem about this time to have been imported into Europe, at least\r\noccasionally, for Berlu in his _Treasury of Drugs_, 1690, describes\r\nit as coming from Bantam in the East Indies, and “_of an infatuating\r\nquality and pernicious use_.“\r\n\r\n[2023] _Journ. of the Agric. and Hortic. Soc. of India_, viii. 167.\r\n\r\n[2024] Bretschneider, _On Chinese Botanical Works_, 1870. 5. 10. Part\r\nof the _Rh-ya_ was written in the 12th cent.

But the introduction of the\r\nIndian drug into European medicine is of still more recent date, and\r\nis chiefly due to the experiments made in Calcutta by O’Shaughnessy\r\nin 1838-39.[2031] Although the astonishing effects produced in India\r\nby the administration of preparations of hemp are seldom witnessed in\r\nthe cooler climate of Britain, the powers of the drug are sufficiently\r\nmanifest to give it an established place in the pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n=Production=—Though hemp is grown in many parts of India, yet as a drug\r\nit is chiefly produced in a limited area in the districts of Bogra and\r\nRājshāhi, north of Calcutta, where the plant is cultivated for the\r\npurpose in a systematic manner. The retail sale, like that of opium and\r\nspirits, is restricted by a license, which in 1871-2 produced to the\r\nGovernment of Bengal about £120,000, while upon opium (chiefly consumed\r\nin Assam) the amount raised was £310,000.[2032] Bhang is one of the\r\nprincipal commodities imported into India from Turkestan.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The leaves of hemp have long stalks with small stipules\r\nat their bases, and are composed of 5 to 7 lanceolate-acuminate\r\nleaflets, sharply serrate at the margin. The loose panicles of male\r\nflowers, and the short spikes of female flowers, are produced on\r\nseparate plants, from the axils of the leaves. The fruits, called\r\n_Hemp-seeds_, are small grey nuts or achenes, each containing a single\r\noily seed. In common with other plants of the order, hemp abounds in\r\nsilica which gives a roughness to its leaves and stems. In European\r\nmedicine, the only hemp employed is that grown in India, which occurs\r\nin two principal forms, namely:—\r\n\r\n1. _=Bhang=_, _Siddhī_ or _Sabzī_ (Hindustani); _Hashish_ or _Qinnaq_\r\n(Arabic). This consists of the dried leaves and small stalks, which are\r\nof a dark green colour, coarsely broken, and mixed with here and there\r\na few fruits. It has a peculiar but not unpleasant odour, and scarcely\r\nany taste. In India, it is smoked either with or without tobacco, but\r\nmore commonly it is made up with flour and various additions into a\r\nsweetmeat or _majun_,[2033] of a green colour. Another form of taking\r\nit is that of an infusion, made by immersing the pounded leaves in cold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n2. _=Ganja=_ (Hindustani); _Qinnab_ (Arabic); _Guaza_[2034] of the\r\nLondon drug-brokers. These are the flowering or fruiting shoots of\r\nthe female plant, and consist in some samples of straight, stiff,\r\nwoody stems some inches long, surrounded by the upward branching\r\nflower-stalks; in others of more succulent and much shorter shoots, 2\r\nto 3 inches long, and of less regular form. In either case, the shoots\r\nhave a compressed and glutinous appearance, are very brittle, and of\r\na brownish-green hue. In odour and in the absence of taste _ganja_\r\nresembles _bhang_. It is said that after the leaves which constitute\r\n_bhang_ have been gathered, little shoots sprout from the stem, and\r\nthat these picked off and dried form what is called _ganja_.[2035]\r\n\r\n[2031] For a notice of them, see O’Shaughnessy, _On the preparation of\r\nthe Indian Hemp or Gunjah_, Calcutta, 1839; also _Bengal Dispensatory_,\r\nCalcutta, 1842. 579-604. An immense number of references to writers who\r\nhave touched on the medicinal properties of hemp, will be found in the\r\nelaborate essay entitled _Studien über den Hanf_, by Dr. G. Martius\r\n(Erlangen, 1855).\r\n\r\n[2032] Blue Book quoted at p. 52, note 1.\r\n\r\n[2033] Magi-oun is the Persian name for electuaries, of which more\r\nthan 70 are found, for instance, in the _Pharmacopœia Persica_ (see\r\nAppendix, Angelus), p. 291 to 321.\r\n\r\n[2034] This name is not used in India, but seems to be a corruption of\r\n_ganja_.\r\n\r\n[2035] Powell, _Economic Products of the Punjab_, Roorkee, i. (1868)\r\n293.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most interesting constituents of hemp, from\r\na medical point of view, are the _resin_ and _volatile oil_.\r\n\r\nThe former was first obtained in a state of comparative purity by T.\r\nand H. Smith in 1846.[2036] It is a brown amorphous solid, burning with\r\na bright white flame and leaving no ash. It has a very potent action\r\nwhen taken internally, two-thirds of a grain acting as a powerful\r\nnarcotic, and one grain producing complete intoxication. From the\r\nexperiments of Messrs. Smith, it seems to us impossible to doubt that\r\nto this resin the energetic effects of cannabis are mainly due.\r\n\r\nWhen water is repeatedly distilled from considerable quantities of\r\nhemp, fresh lots of the latter being used for each operation, a\r\nvolatile oil lighter than water is obtained, together with ammonia.\r\nThis oil, according to the observations of Personne (1857), is\r\namber-coloured, and has an oppressive hemp-like smell. It sometimes\r\ndeposits an abundance of small crystals. With due precautions it may\r\nbe separated into two bodies, the one of which, named by Personne\r\n_Cannabene_,[2037] is liquid and colourless, with the formula\r\nC₁₈H₂₀; the other, which is called _Hydride of Cannabene_, is a\r\nsolid, separating from alcohol in platy crystals to which Personne\r\nassigns the formula C₁₈H₂₂. He asserts that cannabene has indubitably\r\na physiological action, and even claims it as the sole active\r\nprinciple of hemp. Its vapour he states to produce when breathed a\r\nsingular sensation of shuddering, a desire of locomotion, followed by\r\nprostration and sometimes by syncope.[2038] Bohlig in 1840 observed\r\nsimilar effects from the oil, which he obtained from the fresh herb,\r\njust after flowering, to the extent of 0·3 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be proved whether an _alkaloid_ is present in hemp, as\r\nsuggested by Preobraschensky.[2039]\r\n\r\nThe other constituents of hemp are those commonly occurring in other\r\nplants. The leaves yield nearly 20 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\nAs to the resin of Indian hemp, Bolas and Francis in treating it\r\nwith nitric acid, converted it into _Oxycannabin_, C₂₀H₂₀N₂O₇. This\r\ninteresting substance may, they say, be obtained in large prisms from a\r\nsolution in methylic alcohol. It melts at 176° C. and then evaporates\r\nwithout decomposition; it is neutral.[2040] One of us (F.) has\r\nendeavoured to obtain it from the purified resin of charas, but without\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n[2036] _Pharm. Journ._ vi. (1847) 171.\r\n\r\n[2037] _Journ. de Pharm._ xxxix. (1857) 48; Canstatt’s _Jahresbericht_\r\nfor 1857, i. 28.\r\n\r\n[2038] Personne, though he admits the activity of the resin prepared\r\nby Smith’s process, contends that it is a mixed body, and that further\r\npurification deprives it of all volatile matter and renders it inert.\r\nThis is not astonishing when one finds that the “purification” was\r\neffected by treatment with caustic lime or soda-lime, and exposure to\r\na temperature of 300° C. (572° F.)! That the resin of the Edinburgh\r\nchemists does not owe its activity to volatile matter, is proved by\r\ntheir own experiment of exposing a small quantity in a very thin layer\r\nto 82° C. for 8 hours: the medicinal action of the resin so treated was\r\nfound to be unimpaired.\r\n\r\n[2039] Dragendorff’s _Jahresbericht_, 1876. 98.\r\n\r\n[2040] _Chemical News_, xxiv. (1871) 77.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Hemp is employed as a soporific, anodyne, antispasmodic, and\r\nas a nervous stimulant. It is used in the form of alcoholic extract,\r\nadministered either in a solid or liquid form. In the East it is\r\nconsumed to an enormous extent by Hindus and Mahomedans, who either\r\nsmoke it with tobacco, or swallow it in combination with other\r\nsubstances.[2041]\r\n\r\nCharas.\r\n\r\nNo account of hemp as a drug would be complete without some notice of\r\nthis substance, which is regarded as of great importance by Asiatic\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n_Charas_ or _Churrus_ is the resin which exudes in minute drops from\r\nthe yellow glands, with which the plant is provided in increasing\r\nnumber according to the elevated temperature (and altitude?) of the\r\ncountry where it grows. The varieties of hemp richest in resin, at\r\nleast in the Laos country in the Malayan Peninsula, scarcely attain\r\nthe height of 3 feet, and show densely curled leaves.[2042] Charas is\r\ncollected in several ways:—one is by rubbing the tops of the plants\r\nin the hands when the seeds are ripe, and scraping from the fingers\r\nthe adhering resin. Another is thus performed:—men clothed in leather\r\ngarments walk about among growing hemp, in doing which the resin of\r\nthe plant attaches itself to the leather, whence it is from time to\r\ntime scraped off. A third method consists in collecting, with many\r\nprecautions to avoid its poisonous effects, the dust which is caused\r\nwhen heaps of dry _bhang_ are stirred about.[2043]\r\n\r\nBy whichever of these processes obtained, charas is of necessity a foul\r\nand crude drug, the use of which is properly excluded from civilized\r\nmedicine. As before remarked (p. 547) it is not obtainable from hemp\r\ngrown indiscriminately in any situation even in India, but is only to\r\nbe got from plants produced at a certain elevation on the hills.\r\n\r\nThe best charas, which is that brought from Yarkand, is a brown,\r\nearthy-looking substance, forming compact yet friable, irregular\r\nmasses of considerable size. Examined under a strong pocket lens, it\r\nappears to be made up of minute, transparent grains of brown resin,\r\nagglutinated with short hairs of the plant. It has a hemp-like odour,\r\nwith but little taste even in alcoholic solution. A second and a third\r\nquality of Yarkand charas represent the substance in a less pure state.\r\nCharas viewed under the microscope exhibits a crystalline structure,\r\ndue to inorganic matter. It yields from ¼ to ⅓ of its weight of an\r\namorphous resin, which is readily dissolved by bisulphide of carbon or\r\nspirit of wine. The resin does not redden litmus, nor is it soluble in\r\ncaustic potash. It has a dark brown colour, which we have not succeeded\r\nin removing by animal charcoal. The residual part of charas yields to\r\nwater a little chloride of sodium, and consists in large proportion\r\nof carbonate of calcium and peroxide of iron. These results have been\r\nobtained in examining samples from Yarkand.[2044] Other specimens which\r\nwe have also examined, have the aspect of a compact dark resin.\r\n\r\nCharas is exported from Yarkand[2045] and Kashgar, the first of which\r\nplaces exported during 1867, 1830 _maunds_ (146,400 lb.) to Lê, whence\r\nthe commodity is carried to the Punjab and Kashmir. Smaller quantities\r\nare annually imported from Kandahar and Samarkand;[2046] some charas\r\nappears also (1876) to be exported from Mandshuria to China. The drug\r\nis mostly consumed by smoking with tobacco; it is not found in European\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n[2041] For further information, consult Cooke’s _Seven Sisters of\r\nSleep_, Lond., chap. xv.-xvii; also _Jahresbericht_ of Wiggers and\r\nHusemann, 1872. 600.\r\n\r\n[2042] Garnier, _Voyage d’Exploration en Indo-Chine_, ii.

A grant alleged to have been made by William the\r\nConqueror in 1069, of hops and hop-lands in the county of Salop,[2047]\r\nwould indicate, were it free from doubt, a very early cultivation of\r\nthe hop in England.\r\n\r\nAs to the use made of hops in these early times, it would appear that\r\nthey were regarded in somewhat of a medicinal aspect. In the _Herbarium\r\nof Apuleius_,[2048] an English manuscript written about A.D. 1050, it\r\nis said of the hop (_hymele_) that its good qualities are such that men\r\nput it in their usual drinks; and St. Hildegard,[2049] a century later,\r\nstates that the hop (_hoppho_) is added to beverages, partly for its\r\nwholesome bitterness, and partly because it makes them keep.\r\n\r\nHops for brewing were among the produce which the tenants of the abbey\r\nof St. Germain in Paris[2050] had to furnish to the monastery in the\r\nbeginning of the 9th century; yet in the middle of the 14th century,\r\nbeer without such addition was still brewed in Paris.\r\n\r\n[2047] Blount, _Tenures of Land and Customs of Manors_, edited by\r\nHazlitt, 1874. 165.\r\n\r\n[2048] _Leechdoms, Wortcunning and Starcraft of Early England_, edited\r\nby Cockayne, i.

(1844) 714. 896.\r\n\r\nThe brewsters, bakers and millers of London were the subject of a\r\nmandate of Edward I. in A.D. 1298; but there is no reason for inferring\r\nthat the manufacture of malt liquor at this period involved the use of\r\nhops. It is plain indeed that somewhat later, hops were _not_ generally\r\nused, for in the 4th year of Henry VI. (1425-26), an information was\r\nlaid against a person for putting into beer “an unwholesome weed called\r\n_an hopp_;”[2051] and in the same reign, Parliament was petitioned\r\nagainst “that wicked weed called _hops_.”\r\n\r\nBut it is evident that hops were soon found to possess good qualities,\r\nand that though their use was denounced, it was not suppressed. Thus\r\nin the regulations for the household of Henry VIII. (1530-31), there\r\nis an injunction that the brewer is “not to put any hops or brimstone\r\ninto the ale”;[2052] while in the very same year (1530), hundreds of\r\npounds of Flemish hops were purchased for the use of the noble family\r\nof L’Estranges of Hunstanton.[2053]\r\n\r\nIn 1552 the cultivation of hops in England was distinctly sanctioned by\r\nthe 5th and 6th of Edward VI. c. 5, which directs that land formerly in\r\ntillage should again be so cultivated, excepting it should have been\r\nset with _hops_ or saffron. Notwithstanding these facts, hops were\r\nfor a long period hardly regarded an essential in brewing, as may be\r\ngathered from the remark of Gerarde (_ob._ A.D. 1607), who speaks of\r\nthem as used “to season” beer or ale, explaining that notwithstanding\r\ntheir manifold virtues, they “rather make it a physical drinke to\r\nkeepe the body in health, than an ordinary drinke for the quenching of\r\nour thirst.” In reality, other herbs were for a long period employed\r\nto impart to malt liquor a bitter or aromatic taste, as Ground Ivy\r\n(_Nepeta Glechoma_ Benth.); anciently called Ale-hoof or Gill; Alecost\r\n(_Balsamita vulgaris_ L.); Sweet Gale (_Myrica Gale_ L.); and Sage\r\n(_Salvia officinalis_ L.). Even Long Pepper and Bay Berries were used\r\nfor the same purpose,[2054] but in addition to hops.\r\n\r\nThough English hops were esteemed superior to foreign, and were\r\nextensively grown as early as 1603, as shown by an act of James\r\nI.,[2055] Flemish hops continued to be imported in considerable\r\nquantities down to 1693.\r\n\r\n[2051] The authority for this statement is an isolated memorandum in\r\na MS. volume (No. 980) by Thomas Gybbons, preserved in the Harleian\r\ncollection in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[2052] _Archæologia_, iii.

(anno 1603) cap. 18.\r\n\r\n=Structure=—The inflorescence of the male plant constitutes a large\r\npanicle; that of the female is less conspicuous, consisting of stalked\r\ncatkins which by their growth develope large leafy imbricating bracts,\r\nultimately forming an ovoid cone or strobile, which is the officinal\r\npart. This catkin consists of a short central zigzag stalk, bearing\r\noverlapping rudimentary leaflets, each represented by a pair of\r\nstipules. Between them are 4 female florets, each supported by a bract.\r\nAfter flowering, the stipules as well as the bracts are much enlarged,\r\nand then form the persistent, yellowish-green, pendulous strobile. At\r\nmaturity, each bract infolds at its base a small lenticular closed\r\nfruit or nut, ⅒ of an inch in diameter. The nut is surrounded by a\r\nmembranous, one-leafed perigone, and contains within its fragile, brown\r\nshell an exalbuminous seed. These fruits, as well as the axis and the\r\nbase of all the leaf-like organs, are beset with numerous shining,\r\ntranslucent glands, to which the aromatic smell and taste of hops are\r\ndue.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Hops as found in commerce consist entirely of the fully\r\ndeveloped strobiles or cones, more or less compressed. They have a\r\ngreenish yellow colour, an agreeable and peculiar aroma, and a bitter\r\naromatic burning taste. When rubbed in the hand they feel clammy, and\r\nemit a more powerful odour. By keeping, hops lose their greenish colour\r\nand become brown, at the same time acquiring an unpleasant odour, by\r\nreason of the formation of a little valerianic acid. Exposure to the\r\nvapour of sulphurous acid retards or prevents this alteration. For\r\nmedicinal use, hops smelling of sulphurous acid should be avoided,\r\nthough in reality the acid speedily becomes innocuous. Liebig has\r\nrefuted the objections raised by brewers to the sulphuring of hops.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Besides the constituents of the glands\r\nwhich are described in the next article, hops contain according to\r\nEtti’s elaborate investigations (1876, 1878) _humulotannic acid_\r\nand _phlobaphene_. The former is a whitish amorphous mass, soluble\r\nin alcohol, hot water or acetic ether, not in ether. By heating the\r\nhumulotannic acid at 130° C., or by boiling its aqueous or alcoholic\r\nsolutions, it gives off water, and is transformed into phlobaphene, a\r\ndark red amorphous substance,\r\n\r\n     (C₂₅H₂₄O₁₃)₂ = OH₂ · C₅₀H₄₆O₂₅.\r\n    humulotannic        phlobaphene.\r\n        acid.\r\n\r\nThe latter substance, on boiling it with dilute mineral acids, again\r\nloses water and furnishes glucose.\r\n\r\nFrom raw phlobaphene ether removes the _bitter principles_ of hops,\r\na colourless crystallizable and a brown amorphous resin, besides\r\nchlorophyll and essential oil.\r\n\r\nBy distilling hops with water, 0·9 per cent. of _essential oil_ are\r\nobtained. Personne (1854) stated it to contain _Valerol_,[2056] C₆H₁₀O,\r\nwhich passes into valerianic acid; the latter in fact occurs in the\r\nglands, yet according to Méhu[2057] only to the extent of 0·1 to\r\n0·17 per cent. When distilled from the fresh strobiles the oil has a\r\ngreenish colour, but a reddish-brown when old hops have been employed.\r\nWe find it to be devoid of rotatory power, neutral to litmus paper, and\r\nnot striking any remarkable coloration with concentrated sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nGriessmayer (1874) has shown that hops contain _Trimethylamine_, and\r\nin small proportion a liquid volatile alkaloid not yet analysed, which\r\nhe terms _Lupuline_. The latter is stated to have the odour of conine,\r\nand to assume a violet hue when treated with chromate of potassium and\r\nsulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nLastly, Etti also found arabic (pectic) acid, phosphates, nitrates,\r\nmalates, citrates, and also sulphates, chiefly of potassium, to occur\r\nin hops. The amount of ash afforded by hops dried at 100° C. would\r\nappear to be on an average about 6-7 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—England was estimated as having in 1873,\r\n63,276 acres under hops. The chief district for the cultivation is the\r\ncounty of Kent, where in that year 39,040 acres were devoted to this\r\nplant. Hops are grown to a much smaller extent in Sussex, and in still\r\ndiminished quantity in Herefordshire, Hampshire, Worcestershire and\r\nSurrey. The other counties of England and the principality of Wales\r\nproduce but a trifling amount, and Scotland none at all.\r\n\r\nIn continental Europe, hops are most largely produced in Bavaria and\r\nWürttemberg, Belgium and France, but in each on a smaller scale than in\r\nEngland. France in 1872 is stated to have 9223 acres under hops.[2058]\r\n\r\n[2056] A substance with which we are not acquainted.\r\n\r\n[2057] _Thèse_, Montpellier, 1867.\r\n\r\n[2058] _Agricultural Returns of Great Britain_, &c., 1873, presented to\r\nParliament, 48. 49. 70. 71.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the extensive production of hops in England, there is\r\na large importation from other countries. The importation in 1872 was\r\n135,965 cwt., valued at £679,276: of this quantity, Belgium supplied\r\n66,630 cwt., Germany 36,612 cwt., Holland 16,675 cwt., the United\r\nStates 10,414 cwt., France 5,328 cwt. During the same period hops were\r\nexported from the United Kingdom to the extent of 31,215 cwt.[2059]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Hops are administered medicinally as a tonic and sedative,\r\nchiefly in the form of tincture, infusion or extract.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLANDULÆ HUMULI.\r\n\r\n_Lupulina_; _Lupulin_, _Lupulinic Grains_; F. _Lupuline_; G.\r\n_Hopfendrüsen_, _Hopfenstaub_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Humulus Lupulus_ L. (see preceding article). The\r\nminute, shining, translucent glands of the strobile constitute when\r\ndetached therefrom the substance called _Lupulin_.\r\n\r\n=History=—The glands of hop were separated and chemically examined by\r\nL. A. Planche, a pharmacien of Paris, whose observations were first\r\nbriefly described by Loiseleur-Deslongchamps in 1819.[2060] In the\r\nfollowing year, Dr. A. W. Ives of New York[2061] published an account\r\nof his experiments upon hops and their glands, to which latter he\r\napplied the name of _Lupulin_. Payen and Chevallier, Planche and\r\nothers, made further experiments on the same subject, endorsing the\r\nrecommendation of Ives that lupulin (or, as they preferred to call it,\r\n_Lupuline_) might be advantageously used in medicine in place of hops.\r\n\r\n[2059] _Annual Statement of the Trade of the United Kingdom_ for 1872.\r\n49. 93.\r\n\r\n[2060] _Manuel des Plantes usuelles et indigènes_, 1819. ii. 503.\r\n\r\n[2061] Silliman’s _Journ. of Science_, ii. (1820) 302.\r\n\r\n=Production=—Lupulin is obtained by stripping off the bracts of hops,\r\nand shaking and rubbing them; and then separating the powder by a\r\nsieve. The powder thus detached ought to be washed by decantation,\r\nso as to remove from it the sand or earth with which it is always\r\ncontaminated; finally it should be dried, and stored in well-closed\r\nbottles. From the dried strobiles, 8 to 12 per cent. of lupulin may be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Lupulin seen in quantity appears as a yellowish-brown\r\ngranular powder, having an agreeable odour of hops and a bitter\r\naromatic taste. It is gradually wetted by water, instantly by alcohol\r\nor ether, but not by potash or sulphuric acid. By trituration in a\r\nmortar the cells are ruptured so that it may be worked into a plastic\r\nmass. Thrown into the air and then ignited, it burns with a brilliant\r\nflame like lycopodium.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The lupulinic gland or grain, like the\r\ngenerality of analogous organs, is formed by an intumescence of the\r\ncuticle of the nuculæ and bracts of hop (see p. 552). Each grain\r\nis originally attached by a very short stalk, which is no longer\r\nperceptible in the drug. The gland, exhausted by ether and macerated in\r\nwater, is a globular or ovoid thin-walled sac, measuring from 140 to\r\n240 mkm. It consists of two distinct, nearly hemispherical parts; that\r\noriginally provided with the stalk is built up of tabular polyhedric\r\ncells, whilst the upper hemisphere shows a continuous delicate\r\nmembrane. This part therefore easily collapses, and thus exhibits a\r\nvariety of form, the greater also as the grains turn pole or equator to\r\nthe observer.[2062]\r\n\r\nThe hop gland is filled with a thick, dark brown or yellowish liquid,\r\nwhich in the drug is contracted into one mass occupying the centre of\r\nthe gland. It may be expelled in minute drops when the wall is made to\r\nburst by warming the grain in glycerin. The colouring matter, to which\r\nthe wall owes its fine yellow colour, adheres more obstinately to the\r\nthinner hemisphere, and is more easily extracted from the thicker part\r\nby means of ether.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The odour of lupulinic grains resides in the\r\nessential oil, described in the previous article. The bitter principle\r\nformerly called _Lupulin_ or _Lupulite_ was first isolated by Lermer\r\n(1863) who called it the _bitter acid of hops_ (_Hopfenbittersäure_).\r\nIt crystallizes in large brittle rhombic prisms, and possesses in a\r\nhigh degree the peculiar bitter taste of beer, in which however it can\r\nbe present only in very small proportion, it being nearly insoluble in\r\nwater, though easily dissolved by many other liquids. The composition\r\nof this acid, C₃₂H₅₀O₇, appears to approximate it to absinthiin; it is\r\ncontained in the glands in but small proportion. Still smaller is the\r\namount of another crystallizable constituent, regarded by Lermer as an\r\nalkaloid.\r\n\r\nThe main contents of the hop gland consist of wax (_Myricylic\r\npalmitate_, according to Lermer), and resins, one of which is\r\ncrystalline and unites with bases.\r\n\r\nA good specimen of German lupulin, dried over sulphuric acid, yielded\r\nus 7·3 per cent. of ash. The same drug exhausted by boiling ether,\r\nafforded 76·8 per cent. of an extremely aromatic extract, which on\r\nexposure to the steam-bath for a week, lost 3·03 per cent., this loss\r\ncorresponding to the volatile oil and acids. The residual part was\r\nsoluble in glacial acetic acid and could therefore contain but very\r\nlittle fatty matter.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The drug has the properties of hops, but with less of\r\nastringency. It is not often prescribed.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Lupulin is apt to contain sand, and on incineration\r\noften leaves a large amount of ash. Other extraneous matters which\r\nare not unfrequent may be easily recognized by means of a lens. As\r\nthe essential oil in lupulin is soon resinified, the latter should be\r\npreferred fresh, and should be kept excluded from the air.\r\n\r\n[2062] For a full account of the formation of the glands, see Trécul,\r\n_Annales des Sciences Nat._, Bot., i. (1854) 299. An abstract may be\r\nfound in Méhu’s _Etude du Houblon et du Lupulin_, Montpellier, 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nULMACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTEX ULMI.\r\n\r\n_Elm Bark_; F. _Ecorce d’Orme_; G. _Ulmenrinde_, _Rüsterrinde_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Ulmus campestris_ Smith, the Common Elm, a stately\r\ntree, widely diffused over Central, Southern and Eastern Europe,\r\nsouthward to Northern Africa and Asia Minor, and eastward as far\r\nas Amurland, Northern China, and Japan. It is probably not truly\r\nindigenous to Great Britain; but the Wych Elm, _U. montana_ With., is\r\ncertainly wild in the northern and western counties;[2063] the latter\r\nis, according to Schübeler, the only species indigenous to Norway.\r\n\r\nHistory—The classical writers, and especially Dioscorides, were\r\nfamiliar with the astringent properties of the bark of πτελέα, by\r\nwhich name _Ulmus campestris_ is understood. Imaginary virtues are\r\nascribed by Pliny to the bark and leaves of _Ulmus_. Elm bark is\r\nfrequently prescribed in the English Leech-books of the 11th century,\r\nat which period a great many plants of Southern Europe had already been\r\nintroduced into Britain.[2064] Its use is also noticed in Turner’s\r\n_Herbal_ (1568) and in Parkinson’s _Theater of Plants_ (1640), the\r\nauthor of the latter remarking that “all the parts of the Elme are of\r\nmuch use in Physicke.”\r\n\r\nIn the Scandinavian antiquity the fibrous bark of _Ulmus montana_ used\r\nto be made up into ropes.[2065]\r\n\r\n=Description=—Elm bark for use in medicine should be removed from\r\nthe tree in early spring, deprived of its rough corky outer coat,\r\nand then dried. Thus prepared, it is found in the shops in the form\r\nof broad flattish pieces, of a rusty yellowish colour, and striated\r\nsurface especially on the inner side. It is tough and fibrous, nearly\r\ninodorous, and has a woody, slightly astringent taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The liber, which is the only officinal part,\r\nconsists of thick-walled, tangentially-extended parenchyme, in which\r\nthere are some large cells filled with mucilage, while the rest contain\r\na red-brown colouring matter. The mucilage forms a stratified deposit\r\nwithin the cell. Large bast-bundles, arranged in irregular rows,\r\nalternate with the parenchyme, and are intersected by narrow, reddish,\r\nmedullary rays consisting of 2 or 3 rows of cells. The bast-bundles\r\ncontain numerous long tubes about 30 mkm. thick, with narrow cavities;\r\nand besides these, somewhat larger tubes with porous transverse\r\nwalls (cribriform vessels). Each cubic cell of the neighbouring\r\nbast-parenchyme encloses a large crystal, seldom well defined, of\r\noxalate of calcium.\r\n\r\n[2063] On the word _elm_, Dr. Prior remarks that it is nearly\r\nidentical in all the Germanic and Scandinavian dialects, yet does\r\nnot find its root in any of them, but is an adaptation of the Latin\r\n_Ulmus_.—_Popular Names of British Plants_, ed. 2. 1870. 71.\r\n\r\n[2064] _Leechdoms, Wortcunning and Starcraft of Early England_, edited\r\nby Rev. O. Cockayne, ii. (1865) pp. 53. 67. 79. 99. 127 and p. xii.—In\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon recipes, both _Elm_ and _Wych Elm_ are named in the\r\nWelsh “_Meddygon Myddfai_” (see Appendix). Elmwydd or Ilwyf and “Ulmus\r\nromanus,” Ilwyf Rhufain, are met with.\r\n\r\n[2065] Schübeler, _Pflanzenwelt Norwegens_, 1873-75, p. 216.\r\n\r\n=Chemistry=—The chief soluble constituent of elm hark is mucilage with\r\na small proportion of tannic acid, the latter, according to Johanson\r\n(1875), probably agreeing with that of oak bark and bark of willows.\r\nThe concentrated infusion of elm bark yields a brown precipitate with\r\nperchloride of iron; the dilute assumes a green coloration with that\r\ntest. Starch is wanting, or only occurs in the middle cortical layer,\r\nwhich is usually rejected.\r\n\r\nElms in summer-time frequently exude a gum which, by contact with the\r\nair, is converted into a brown insoluble mass, called _Ulmin_. This\r\nname has been extended to various decomposition-products of organic\r\nbodies, the nature and affinities of which are but little known.[2066]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Elm bark is prescribed in decoction as a weak mucilaginous\r\nastringent, but is almost obsolete.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTEX ULMI FULVÆ.\r\n\r\n_Slippery Elm Bark._\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Ulmus fulva_ Michaux, the Red or Slippery Elm, a\r\nsmall or middle-sized tree,[2067] seldom more than 30 to 40 feet high,\r\ngrowing on the banks of streams in the central and northern United\r\nStates from Western New England to Wisconsin and Kentucky, and found\r\nalso in Canada.\r\n\r\n=History=—The Indians of North America attributed medicinal virtues to\r\nthe bark of the Slippery Elm, which they used as a healing application\r\nto wounds, and in decoction as a wash for skin diseases. It is the\r\n“Salve Bark” or “Cortex unguentarius” of Schöpf.[2068] Bigelow, writing\r\nin 1824, remarks that the mucilaginous qualities of the inner bark are\r\nwell known.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The Slippery Elm Bark used in medicine consists of the\r\nliber only. It forms large flat pieces, often 2 to 3 feet long by\r\nseveral inches broad, and usually ¹/₂₀ to ²/₂₀ of an inch thick, of\r\nan extremely tough and fibrous texture. It has a light reddish-brown\r\ncolour, an odour resembling that of fenugreek (which is common to the\r\nleaves also), and a simply mucilaginous taste.\r\n\r\nIn collecting the bark the tree is destroyed, and no effort is made\r\nto replace it, the wood being nearly valueless. Thus the supply is\r\ndiminishing year by year, and the collectors who formerly obtained\r\nlarge quantities of the bark in New York and other eastern states have\r\nnow to go westward for supplies.[2069]\r\n\r\n[2066] Gmelin, _Chemistry_, xvii.

The whole tissue\r\nis traversed by numerous narrow medullary rays, and interrupted by\r\nlarge intercellular mucilage-ducts. In order to examine the latter,\r\nlongitudinal sections ought to be moistened with benzol, aqueous\r\nliquids causing great alteration. In a longitudinal section, the\r\nmucilage-ducts are seen to be 70 to 100 mkm. long, and to contain\r\ncolourless masses of mucilage, distinctly showing a series of layers.\r\nCrystals of calcium oxalate, as well as small starch grains, are very\r\nplentiful throughout the surrounding parenchyme.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most interesting constituent of the bark is\r\nmucilage, which is imparted to either cold or hot water, but does not\r\nform a true solution. The bark moistened with 20 parts of water swells\r\nconsiderably, and becomes enveloped by a thick neutral mucilage, which\r\nis not altered either by iodine or perchloride of iron. This mucilage\r\nwhen diluted, even with a triple volume of water, will yield only a\r\nfew drops when thrown on a paper filter. The liquid which drains out\r\nis precipitable by neutral acetate of lead. By addition of absolute\r\nalcohol, the concentrated mucilage is not rendered turbid, but forms a\r\ncolourless transparent fluid deposit.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Farinaceous substances admixed to the powdered drug may\r\nbe detected by means of the microscope.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Slippery Elm Bark is a demulcent like althæa or linseed. The\r\npowder is much used in America for making poultices; it is said to\r\npreserve lard from rancidity, if the latter is melted with it and kept\r\nin contact for a short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEUPHORBIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUPHORBIUM.\r\n\r\n_Euphorbium_, _Gum Euphorbium_; F. _Gomme-résine d’Euphorbe_; G.\r\n_Euphorbium_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Euphorbia resinifera_ Berg, a leafless, glaucous,\r\nperennial plant resembling a cactus, and attaining 6 or more feet in\r\nheight. Its stems are ascending, fleshy and quadrangular, each side\r\nmeasuring about an inch. The angles of the stem are furnished at\r\nintervals with pairs of divergent, horizontal, straight spines about ¼\r\nof an inch long, and confluent at the base into ovate, subtriangular\r\ndiscs. These spines represent stipules: above each pair of them is a\r\ndepression, indicating a leaf-bud. The inflorescence is arranged at the\r\nsummits of the branches, on stalks each bearing three flowers, the two\r\nouter of which are supported on pedicels. The fruit is tricoccous, ³/₁₀\r\nof an inch wide, with each carpel slightly compressed and keeled.[2070]\r\n\r\nThe plant is a native of Morocco, growing on the lower slopes of\r\nthe Atlas in the southern province of Suse. Dr. Hooker and his\r\nfellow-travellers met with it in 1870 at Netifa and Imsfuia,[2071]\r\nsouth-east of the city of Morocco, which appears to be its westward\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\n=History=—Euphorbium was known to the ancients. Dioscorides[2072] and\r\nPliny[2073] both describe its collection on Mount Atlas in Africa, and\r\nnotice its extreme acridity. According to the latter writer, the drug\r\nreceived its name in honour of Euphorbus, physician to Juba II., king\r\nof Mauritania. This monarch, who after a long reign died about A.D. 18,\r\nwas distinguished for his literary attainments, and was the author of\r\nseveral books[2074] which included treatises on opium and euphorbium.\r\nThe latter work was apparently extant in the time of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[2070] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen’s _Med.

(1846) 636.\r\n\r\nEuphorbium is mentioned by numerous other early writers on medicine, as\r\nRufus Ephesius, who probably flourished during the reign of Trajan, by\r\nGalen in the 2nd century, and by Vindicianus and Oribasius in the 4th.\r\nAëtius and Paulus Ægineta, who lived respectively in the 6th and 7th\r\ncenturies, were likewise acquainted with it; and it was also known to\r\nthe Arabian school of medicine. In describing the route from Aghmat to\r\nFez, El-Bekri[2075] of Granada, in 1068, mentioned the numerous plants\r\n“El-forbioun” growing in the country of the Beni Ouareth, a tribe of\r\nthe Sanhadja; the author noticed the spiny herbaceous stems of the\r\nshrub abounding in the purgative milky juice.\r\n\r\nHöst[2076] (1760-1768) stated that the plant, which he also correctly\r\ncompared with Opuntia, is growing near Agader, south of Mogador.\r\n\r\nThe plant yielding euphorbium was further described at the beginning\r\nof the present century by an English merchant named Jackson, who had\r\nresided many years in Morocco. From the figures he published,[2077]\r\nthe species was doubtfully identified with _Euphorbia canariensis_\r\nL., a large cactus-like shrub, with quadrangular or hexagonal stems,\r\nabounding on scorched and arid rocks in the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1749 it was pointed out in the (_Admiralty_) _Manual of\r\nScientific Enquiry_, that the stems of which fragrants are found in\r\ncommercial euphorbium, do not agree with those of _E. canariensis_.\r\nBerg carried the comparison further, and finally from the fragments\r\nin question drew up a botanical description, which with an excellent\r\nfigure he published[2078] as _Euphorbia resinifera_. The correctness\r\nof his observations has been fully justified by specimens[2079] which\r\nwere transmitted to the Royal Gardens, Kew, in 1870, and now form\r\nflourishing plants.\r\n\r\n[2075] _Description de l’Afrique septentrionale_, traduite par M. de\r\nSlane, _Journal asiatique_, xiii.

The\r\nlatter is really the figure of a different species,—apparently that\r\nwhich has been recently named by Cosson _Euphorbia Beaumierana_.\r\n\r\n[2078] Berg und Schmidt, _Offizinelle Gewächse_, iv. (1863) xxxiv. d.\r\n\r\n[2079] They were procured by Mr. William Grace, and forwarded to\r\nEngland by Mr. C. F. Carstensen, British Vice-Consul at Mogador.\r\n\r\nThe drug has a place in all the early printed pharmacopœias.\r\n\r\n=Collection=—Euphorbium is obtained by making incisions in the green\r\nfleshy branches of the plant. These incisions occasion an abundant\r\nexudation of milky juice which hardens by exposure to the air,\r\nencrusting the stems down which it flows; it is finally collected\r\nin the latter part of the summer. So great is the acridity of the\r\nexudation, that the collector is obliged to tie a cloth over his mouth\r\nand nostrils, to prevent the entrance of the irritating dust. The drug\r\nis said to be collected in districts lying east and south-east of the\r\ncity of Morocco.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The drug consists of irregular pieces, seldom more\r\nthan an inch across and mostly smaller, of a dull yellow or brown\r\nwaxy-looking substance, among which portions of the angular spiny\r\nstem of the plant may be met with. Many of the pieces encrust a tuft\r\nof spines or a flower-stalk or are hollow. The substance is brittle\r\nand translucent; splinters examined under the microscope exhibit\r\nno particular structure, even by the aid of polarized light; nor\r\nare starch granules visible.[2080] The odour is slightly aromatic,\r\nespecially if heat is applied; but 10 lb. of the drug which we\r\nsubjected to distillation afforded no essential oil. Euphorbium has\r\na persistent and extremely acrid taste; its dust excites violent\r\nsneezing, and if inhaled, as when the drug is powdered, occasions\r\nalarming symptoms.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Analysis of euphorbium performed by one of\r\nus[2081] showed the composition of the drug to be as follows:—\r\n\r\n    Amorphous resin, C₁₀H₁₆O₂                 38\r\n    Euphorbon, C₁₃H₂₂O                        22\r\n    Mucilage                                  18\r\n    Malates, chiefly of calcium and sodium    12\r\n    Mineral compounds                         10\r\n                                           ------\r\n                                             100\r\n\r\nThe amorphous resin is readily soluble in cold spirit of wine\r\ncontaining about 70 per cent. of alcohol. The solution has no acid\r\nreaction, but an extremely burning acrid taste: in fact it is to the\r\namorphous indifferent resin that euphorbium owes its intense acridity.\r\nBy evaporating the resin with alcoholic potash and neutralizing the\r\nresidue with a dilute aqueous acid, a brown amorphous substance, the\r\n_Euphorbic Acid_ of Buchheim,[2082] is precipitated. It is devoid of\r\nthe acridity of the resin from which it originated, but has a bitterish\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nFrom the drug deprived of the amorphous resin as above stated, ether\r\n(ether or petroleum) takes up the _Euphorbon_, which may be obtained\r\nin colourless, although not very distinct crystals, which are at\r\nfirst not free from acrid taste. But by repeated crystallizations\r\nand finally boiling in a weak solution of permanganate of potassium,\r\nthey may be so far purified as to be entirely tasteless. Euphorbon is\r\ninsoluble in water; it requires about 60 parts of alcohol, sp. gr.\r\n0·830, for solution at the ordinary temperature. In boiling alcohol\r\neuphorbon dissolves abundantly, also in ether, benzol, amylic alcohol,\r\nchloroform, acetone, or glacial acetic acid.\r\n\r\nEuphorbon melts at 116° C. (113° to 114°, Hesse) without emitting\r\nany odour. By dry distillation a brownish oily liquid is obtained,\r\nwhich claims further examination. If euphorbon dissolved in alcohol\r\nis allowed to form a thin film in a porcelain capsule, and is then\r\nmoistened with a little concentrated sulphuric acid, a fine violet hue\r\nis produced in contact with strong nitric acid slowly added by means\r\nof a glass rod. The same reaction is displayed by _Lactucerin_ (see\r\nLactucarium), to which in its general characters euphorbon is closely\r\nallied.\r\n\r\n[2080] By careful investigation a very few are found at last.\r\n\r\n[2081] Flückiger in Wittstein’s _Vierteljahresschrift für prakt.\r\nPharmacie_, xvii. (1868) 82-102.—The drug analysed consisted of\r\nselected fragrants, free from extraneous substances.\r\n\r\n[2082] Wiggers and Husemann, _Jahresbericht_, 1873. 559.\r\n\r\nHesse (1878) assigns to euphorbon the formula C₁₅H₂₄O, and points out\r\nthat its solutions in chloroform or ether are dextrogyrate.\r\n\r\nAs to the mucilage of euphorbium, it may be obtained from that portion\r\nof the drug which has been exhausted by cold alcohol and by ether.\r\nNeutral acetate of lead, as well as silicate or borate of sodium,\r\nprecipitate this mucilage, which therefore does not agree with gum\r\narabic.\r\n\r\nIf an aqueous extract of euphorbium is mixed with spirit of wine,\r\nand the liquid evaporated, the residual matter assumes a somewhat\r\ncrystalline appearance, and exhibits the reactions of _Malic Acid_.\r\nSubjected to dry distillation, white scales and acicular crystals of\r\n_Maleic_ and _Fumaric Acids_, produced by the decomposition of the\r\nmalic acid, are sublimed into the neck of the retort. A sublimate of\r\nthe same kind may sometimes be obtained directly by heating fragments\r\nof euphorbium. Among the mineral constituents of the drug, chloride of\r\nsodium and calcium are noticeable; scarcely any salt of potassium is\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The drug is shipped from Mogador. The quantity imported into\r\nthe United Kingdom in 1870 is given in the _Annual Statement of Trade_\r\nas 12 cwt.\r\n\r\n_Uses_—Euphorbium was formerly employed as an emetic and purgative,\r\nbut as an internal remedy it is completely obsolete. We have been told\r\nthat it is now in some demand as an ingredient of a paint for the\r\npreservation of ships’ bottoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTEX CASCARILLÆ.\r\n\r\n_Cortex Eleutheriæ_; _Cascarilla Bark_, _Sweet Wood Bark_,\r\n_Eleuthera[2083] Bark_; F. _Ecorce de Cascarille_; G. _Cascarill-Rinde_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Croton Eluteria_ Bennett,[2084] a shrub or small\r\ntree, exclusively native of the Bahama Islands.\r\n\r\n=History=—It is not improbable that cascarilla bark was imported\r\ninto Europe in the first half of the 17th century, as there was much\r\nintercourse subsequent to the year 1630 between England and the\r\nBahamas.[2085] These islands were occupied in 1641 by the Spaniards,\r\nwho became at that time acquainted with the Peruvian bark or Cascarilla\r\n(see page 346), as we have shown at page 343. The external appearance\r\nof the bark of Eluteria being somewhat similar to that of Cinchona\r\nquills, the former began soon to be known under the name of _China\r\nnova_. This drug occurs along with true Cinchona bark, _China de\r\nChina_, in the tariff of the year 1691 of the pharmaceutical shops of\r\nthe German town Minden, in Westphalia. There can be no doubt that the\r\ncheaper kind of “China,” called China nova, was really the bark under\r\nexamination, for in many other tariffs a few years later distinct\r\nmention is made of _Cortex Chinæ novæ seu Schacorillæ_; and Savary,\r\nin his “Dictionnaire de Commerce” (1723, 1750), confirms the fact,\r\nadding that it was first seen in the great fair of Brunswick.[2086]\r\nAnother early statement concerning Cascarilla bark likewise refers to\r\nthe duchy of Brunswick. Stisser, a professor of anatomy, chemistry,\r\nand medicine in the University of Helmstedt in Brunswick, relates\r\nthat he received the drug under the name of _Cortex Eleuterii_ from a\r\nperson who had returned from England, in which country, he was assured,\r\nit was customary to mix it with tobacco for the sake of correcting\r\nthe smell of the latter when smoked. He also mentions that it had\r\nbeen confounded with Peruvian bark, from which however it was very\r\ndistinct in odour, etc.[2087] Eleutheria bark was then frequently\r\nprescribed as a febrifuge in the place of Cinchona bark, then a more\r\nexpensive medicine. Hence the name _cascarilla_, signifying in Spanish\r\n_little bark_, which was the customary designation of Peruvian bark,\r\nwas erroneously applied to the Bahama bark, until at last it quite\r\nsuperseded the original and more correct appellation. That of _China\r\nnova_ was subsequently applied to a quite different bark (see page\r\n364). The drug under notice was first introduced into the London\r\nPharmacopœia in 1746 as _Eleutheriæ Cortex_, which was its common name\r\namong druggists down to the end of the last century. In the Bahamas the\r\nname _cascarilla_ is still hardly known, the bark being there called\r\neither _Sweet Wood Bark_ or _Eleuthera Bark_.\r\n\r\n[2083] From Eleuthera, one of the Bahama Islands, so named from the\r\nGreek ἐλεύθερος, signifying _free_ or _independent_.\r\n\r\n[2084] Bentley and Trimen’s _Med. Plants_, part i. (1875).\r\n\r\n[2085] In that year a patent was granted by Charles I. for the\r\nincorporation of a Company for colonizing the Bahama Islands, and\r\na complete record is extant of the proceedings of the Company for\r\nthe first eleven years of its existence. In some of the documents,\r\nparticular mention is made of the introduction, actual or attempted,\r\nof useful plants, as cotton, tobacco, fig, pepper, pomegranate, palma\r\nChristi, mulberry, flax, indigo, madder, and jalap; and there is also\r\nfrequent allusion to the importation of the produce of the islands, but\r\nno mention of _Cascarilla_. See _Calendar of State Papers_, Colonial\r\nSeries, 1574-1660, edited by Sainsbury, Lond. 1860. pp. 146. 148. 149.\r\n164. 168. 185. etc.\r\n\r\n[2086] Flückiger, _Pharm. Journ._, vi. (1876) 1022, and “Documente”\r\nquoted there, pp. 74-77, etc.\r\n\r\n[2087] Stisser (J. A.) _Actorum Laboratorii Chemici specimen secundum_,\r\nHelmestadi, 1693. c. ix. Stisser is said to have mentioned Cascarilla\r\nbark in his pamphlet “De machinis fumiductoriis,” Hamburg, 1686, but\r\nwe found this to be incorrect. Nor have we seen the paper of Vincent\r\nGarcia Salat, “Unica quæstiuncula, in qua examinatur pulvis de Burango,\r\nvulgo _Cascarilla_, in curatione tertíanæ,” Valentiæ. 1692. It is\r\nquoted by Haller, _Bibl. Bot._ ii. (1772) 688, and several later\r\nauthors, but appears to be extremely rare.\r\n\r\nThe plant affording cascarilla has been the subject of much discussion,\r\narising chiefly from the circumstance that several nearly allied West\r\nIndian species of _Croton_ yield aromatic barks resembling more or less\r\nthe officinal drug. Catesby in 1754 figured a Bahama plant, _Croton\r\nCascarilla_ Bennett, from which the original _Eleuthera Bark_ was\r\nprobably derived, though it certainly affords none of the cascarilla\r\nof modern commerce. Woodville in 1794, and Lindley in 1838, both\r\ninvestigated the botany of the subject, the latter having the advantage\r\nof authentic specimens communicated by the Hon. J. C. Lees of New\r\nProvidence, to whom one of us also is indebted for a similar favour.\r\nThe question was not however finally set at rest until 1859, when J. J.\r\nBennett by the aid of specimens collected in the Bahamas by Daniell in\r\n1857-8, drew up lucid diagnoses of the several plants which had been\r\nconfounded, and disentangled their intricate synonymy.[2088]\r\n\r\n[2088] _Journal of Proceedings of Linn. Soc._ iv. (1860) Bot. 29.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Cascarilla occurs in the form of tubular or channelled\r\npieces of a dull brown colour, somewhat rough and irregular, rarely\r\nexceeding 4 inches in length by ½ an inch in diameter. The chief bulk\r\nof that at present imported is in very small thin quills and fragments,\r\noften scarcely an inch in length, and evidently stripped from very\r\nyoung wood. The younger bark has a thin suberous coat easily detached,\r\nblotched or entirely covered with the silvery white growth of a minute\r\nlichen (_Verrucaria albissima_ Ach.), the perithecium of which appears\r\nas small black dots. The older bark is more rugose, irregularly\r\ntessellated by longitudinal cracks and less numerous transverse\r\nfissures. Beneath the corky envelope the bark is greyish-brown.\r\n\r\nThe bark breaks readily with a short fracture, the broken surface\r\ndisplaying a resinous appearance. It has a very fragrant odour,\r\nespecially agreeable when several pounds of it are reduced to coarse\r\npowder and placed in a jar; it has a nauseous bitter taste. When\r\nburned it emits an aromatic smell, and hence is a common ingredient in\r\nfumigating pastilles.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Characters=—The suberous coat is made up of numerous\r\nrows of tabular cells, the outermost having their exterior walls much\r\nthickened. The mesophlœum exhibits the usual tissue, containing starch,\r\nchlorophyll, essential oil, crystals of oxalate of calcium, and a\r\nbrown colouring matter. The latter assumes a dark bluish coloration\r\non addition of a persalt of iron. In the inner portion of that layer\r\nramified laticiferous vessels are also present. The liber consists of\r\nparenchyme and of fibrous bundles, intersected by small medullary rays.\r\nOn the transverse section, the fibrous bundles show a wedge-shaped\r\noutline; they are for the most part built up, not of true liber-fibres,\r\nbut of cylindrical cells having their transverse walls perforated\r\nsieve-like (_vasa cribriformia_). The contents of the parenchymatous\r\npart of the liber are the same as in the mesophlœum; as to the oxalate\r\nof calcium, the variety of its crystals is remarkable.[2089]\r\n\r\n[2089] For more particulars see Pocklington, _Pharm. Journ._ iii.\r\n(1873) 664.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Cascarilla contains a volatile oil, which it\r\nyields to the extent of 1·1 per cent. According to Völckel (1840),\r\nit is a mixture of at least two oils, the more volatile of which is\r\nprobably free from oxygen. Gladstone (1872) assigns to the hydrocarbon\r\nof cascarilla oil the composition of oil of turpentine. By examining\r\nthe oil optically we found it to have a weak rotatory power—some\r\nsamples deviated to the right, some to the left. The resin, in which\r\ncascarilla is rich, has not yet been examined more exactly.\r\n\r\nThe bitter principle was isolated in 1845 by Duval, and called\r\n_Cascarillin_. C. and E. Mylius (1873) have obtained it from a deposit\r\nin the officinal extract, in microscopic prisms readily soluble in\r\nether or hot alcohol, very sparingly in water, chloroform or spirit\r\nof wine. It melts at 205° C., is not volatile, nor a glucoside. Its\r\ncomposition answers to the formula C₁₂H₁₈O₄.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The bark is shipped from Nassau, the chief town of New\r\nProvidence (Bahamas), and is usually packed in sacks. The quantity\r\nimported into the United Kingdom in 1870 was 12,261 cwt., valued at\r\n£16,482. The exports from the Bahamas were 676 cwt. in 1875, and 1,093\r\ncwt. in 1876.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Cascarilla is prescribed as a tonic, usually in the form of a\r\ntincture or infusion.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—A spurious cascarilla bark has lately been noticed\r\nin the London market; it was imported from the Bahamas mixed with\r\nthe genuine, to which it bears a close similarity. The quills of\r\nit resemble the larger quills of cascarilla; though covered with a\r\nlichen, the latter has not the silvery whiteness of the _Verrucaria_\r\nof cascarilla. The spurious bark has a suberous coat that does\r\nnot split off; its inner surface is pinkish-brown, and distinctly\r\nstriated longitudinally. In microscopic structure the bark may be said\r\nto resemble cascarilla and still more copalchi. But it is at once\r\ndistinguishable by its numerous _roundish groups_ of sclerenchymatous\r\ncells, which become very evident when thin sections are moistened with\r\nammonia, and then with solution of iodine in iodide of potassium. The\r\nbark has an astringent taste, without bitterness or aroma; its tincture\r\nis not rendered milky by addition of water, but is darkened by ferric\r\nchloride,—in these respects differing from a tincture of cascarilla.\r\nMr. Holmes[2090] suggests that this spurious cascarilla is probably the\r\nbark of _Croton lucidus_ L.\r\n\r\nCopalchi Bark; Quina blanca of the Mexicans.\r\n\r\nThis drug is derived from _Croton niveus_[2091] Jacquin (_C.\r\nPseudo-China_ Schlechtendal), a shrub growing 10 feet high, native\r\nof the West Indian Islands, Mexico, Central America, New Granada and\r\nVenezuela. It has occasionally been imported into Europe, in quills\r\na foot or two in length, much stouter and thicker than those of\r\ncascarilla, to which in odour and taste it nearly approximates. The\r\nbark has a thin, greyish, papery suberous layer, which when removed\r\nshows the surface marked with minute transverse pits, like the lines\r\nmade by a file; it has a short fracture.[2092]\r\n\r\nCopalchi bark was examined by J. Eliot Howard,[2093] and found to\r\ncontain a minute proportion of a bitter alkaloid soluble in ether,\r\nwhich resembled quinine in yielding a deep green colour when treated\r\nwith chlorine and ammonia, though it did not afford any characteristic\r\ncompound with iodine. Mauch,[2094] who also analysed the bark, could\r\nnot obtain from it any organic base. He extracted by distillation\r\nthe essential oil, which he found to consist of a hydrocarbon and an\r\norganic acid,—the latter not examined; he likewise got from the bark an\r\nuncrystallizable bitter principle, which proved to be not a glucoside.\r\n\r\n[2090] _Pharm.

(_Tiglium officinale_\r\nKlotzsch), a small tree, 15 to 20 feet high, indigenous to the Malabar\r\nCoast and Tavoy, cultivated in gardens in many parts of the East, from\r\nMauritius to the India Archipelago. The tree has small inconspicuous\r\nflowers, and brown, capsular, three-celled fruits, each cell containing\r\none seed. The leaves have a disagreeable smell and nauseous taste.\r\n\r\n=History=—In Europe, the seeds and wood of the tree were first\r\ndescribed in 1578 by Christoval Acosta—the former, with a figure of the\r\nplant, appearing under the name of _Piñones de Maluco_.[2096] The plant\r\nwas also described and figured by Rheede (1679)[2097] and Rumphius\r\n(1743).[2098] The seeds, which were officinal in the 17th century, but\r\nhad become obsolete, were recommended about 1812 by English medical\r\nofficers in India,[2099] and the expressed oil by Perry, Frost, Conwell\r\nand others about 1821-24. The oil then in use was imported from India,\r\nand was often of doubtful purity, so that some druggists felt it\r\nnecessary to press the seeds for themselves.[2100]\r\n\r\n[2095] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen’s _Medic.

The oil was purchased in 1826 by the same house at 8_s._ to 10_s._\r\nper ounce.—D. H.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Croton seeds are about half an inch long, by nearly ⅖ of\r\nan inch broad, ovoid or bluntly oblong, divided longitudinally into\r\ntwo unequal parts, of which the more arched constitutes the dorsal\r\nand the flatter the ventral side. From the hilum, a fine raised line\r\n(raphe) passes to the other end of the seed, terminating in a darker\r\npoint, indicating the chalaza. The surface of the seed is more or less\r\ncovered with a bright cinnamon-brown coat, which when scraped shows the\r\nthin, brittle, black testa filled with a whitish, oily kernel, invested\r\nwith a delicate seed-coat. The kernel is easily split into two halves\r\nconsisting of oily albumen, between which lie the large, veined, leafy\r\ncotyledons and the radicle. The taste of the seed is at first merely\r\noleaginous, but soon becomes unpleasantly and persistently acrid.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The testa consists of an outer layer of\r\nradially arranged, much elongated and thick-walled cells; the inner\r\nparenchymatous layer contains small vascular bundles. The soft tissue\r\nof the albumen is loaded with drops of fatty oil. If this is removed\r\nby means of ether and weak potash lye, there remain small granules of\r\nalbuminoid matter, the so-called _Aleuron_, and crystals of oxalate of\r\ncalcium.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The principal constituent of croton seeds is the\r\nfatty oil, the _Oleum Crotonis_ or _Oleum Tiglii_ of pharmacy of which\r\nthe kernels afford from 50 to 60 per cent. That used in England is for\r\nthe most part expressed in London, and justly regarded as more reliable\r\nthan that imported from India, with which the market was formerly\r\nsupplied. It is a transparent, sherry-coloured, viscid liquid, slightly\r\nfluorescent, and having a slight rancid smell and an oily, acrid taste.\r\nIts solubility in alcohol (·794) appears to depend in great measure on\r\nthe age of the oil, and the greater or less freshness of the seeds from\r\nwhich it was expressed,—oxidized or resinified oil dissolving the most\r\nreadily.[2101] We found the oil which one of us had extracted by means\r\nof bisulphide of carbon to be levogyre.\r\n\r\nCroton oil consists chiefly of the glycerinic ethers of the common\r\nfatty acids, such as stearic, palmitic, myristic and lauric acids. They\r\npartly separate in the cold; the acids also may partly be obtained by\r\npassing nitrous acid through croton oil. There are also present in the\r\nlatter, in the form of glycerinic ethers, the more volatile acids, as\r\nformic, acetic, isobutyric and one of the valerianic acids.[2102] The\r\nvolatile part of the acids yielded by croton oil contains moreover an\r\nacid which was regarded by Schlippe (1858) as angelic acid, C₅H₈O₂.\r\nYet in 1869 it was shown by Geuther and Frölich to be a peculiar\r\nacid, which they called _Tiglinic acid_. Its composition answers to\r\nthe same formula, C₄H₇COOH, as that of angelic acid; but the melting\r\npoints (angelic acid 45°, tiglinic 64° C.) and boiling points (angelic\r\nacid 185°, tiglinic 198°·5) are different. Both these acids have been\r\nmentioned in our article on Flores Anthemidis, at page 386. Tiglinic\r\nacid may also be obtained artificially; it is the methylcrotonic acid\r\nof Frankland and Duppa (1865).\r\n\r\nSchlippe also stated croton oil to afford a peculiar liquid acid termed\r\n_Crotonic Acid_, C₄H₆O₂. According to Geuther and Frölich, however, an\r\nacid of this formula does not occur at all in croton oil. By synthetic\r\nmethods three different acids of that composition are obtainable.\r\n\r\nThe _drastic principle_ of croton oil has not yet been isolated.\r\nBuchheim[2103] suggested that the action of the oil depends\r\nupon “_Crotonoleic acid_,” which however he failed in isolating\r\nsatisfactorily. It is remarkable that the wood and leaves of _Croton\r\nTiglium_ appear to partake also of the drastic properties of the seeds.\r\n\r\nSchlippe asserts that he has separated the _vesicating matter_ of\r\ncroton oil: if the oil be agitated with alcoholic soda, and afterwards\r\nwith water, the supernatant liquor will be found free from acridity,\r\nwhile the alcoholic solution will yield, on addition of hydrochloric\r\nacid, a small quantity of a dark brown oil, called _Crotonol_,\r\npossessing vesicating properties. We have not succeeded in obtaining\r\nit, nor, so far as we know, has any other chemist except its discoverer.\r\n\r\nThe shells of the seeds (testa) yield upon incineration 2·6 per cent.\r\nof ash; the kernels dried at 100° C. 3·0 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The shipments of croton seeds arrive chiefly from Cochin or\r\nBombay, packed in cases, bales or robbins; but there are no statistics\r\nto show the extent of the trade.\r\n\r\n[2101] Warrington, _Pharm. Journ._ vi. (1865) 382-387.\r\n\r\n[2102] Schmidt and Berendes, 1878.\r\n\r\n[2103] In the _Jahresbericht_ of Wiggers and Husemann, 1873. 560.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Croton seeds are not administered. The oil is given internally\r\nas a powerful cathartic, and is applied externally as a rubefacient.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—The seeds of _Croton Pavanæ_ Hamilton, a native of Ava\r\nand Camrup (Assam), and those of _C. oblongifolius_ Roxb., a small\r\ntree common about Calcutta, are said to resemble those of _C. Tiglium_\r\nL., but we have not compared them. Those of _Baliospermum montanum_\r\nMüll. Arg. (_Croton polyandrus_ Roxb.) partake of the nature of croton\r\nseeds, and according to Roxburgh are used by the natives of India as a\r\npurgative.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEN RICINI.\r\n\r\n_Semen Cataputiæ majoris_; _Castor Oil Seeds_, _Palma Christi Seeds_;\r\nF. _Semence de Ricin_; G. _Ricinussamen_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Ricinus communis_ L., the castor oil plant, is a\r\nnative of India where it bears several ancient Sanskrit names.[2104] By\r\ncultivation, it has been distributed through all the tropical and many\r\nof the temperate countries of the globe. In the regions most favourable\r\nto its growth, it attains a height of 40 feet. In the Azores, and the\r\nwarmer Mediterranean countries as Algeria, Egypt, Greece, and the\r\nRiviera, it becomes a small tree, 10 to 15 feet high; while in France,\r\nGermany, and the south of England, it is an annual herb of noble\r\nfoliage, growing to a height of 4 or 5 feet. In good summers, it ripens\r\nseeds in England and even as far north as Christiania in Norway.\r\n\r\n_Ricinus communis_ exhibits a large number of varieties, several of\r\nwhich have been described and figured as distinct species. Müller,\r\nafter a careful examination of the whole series, maintains them as\r\na single species, of which he allows 16 forms, more or less well\r\nmarked.[2105]\r\n\r\n=History=—The castor oil plant was known to Herodotus who calls it\r\nΚίκι, and states that it furnishes an oil much used by the Egyptians,\r\nin whose ancient tombs seeds of Ricinus are, in fact, met with.[2106]\r\nAt the period when Herodotus wrote, it would appear to have been\r\nalready introduced into Greece, where it is cultivated to the present\r\nday under the same ancient name.[2107] The _Kikajon_ of the Book of\r\nJonah, rendered by the translators of the English Bible _gourd_, is\r\nbelieved to be the same plant. Κίκι is also mentioned by Strabo as a\r\nproduction of Egypt, the oil from which is used for burning in lamps\r\nand for unguents.\r\n\r\n[2104] The most ancient and most usual is _Eranda_; this word has\r\npassed into several other Indian languages.\r\n\r\n[2105] De Candolle, _Prodr._, xv. sect. 2. 1017.\r\n\r\n[2106] _Journ. of Botany_, 1879, 54.\r\n\r\n[2107] Heldreich, _Nutzpflanzen Griechenlands_, Athen, 1862. 58.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus and Nicander give the castor oil plant the name of Κρότων.\r\nDioscorides, who calls it Κίκι or Κρότων, describes it as of the\r\nstature of a small fig-tree, with leaves like a plane, and seeds in a\r\nprickly pericarp, observing that the name Κρότων is applied to the seed\r\non account of its resemblance to an insect [_Ixodes Ricinus_ Latr.],\r\nknown by that appellation. He also gives an account of the process for\r\nextracting castor oil (Κίκινον ἔλαιον), which he says is not fit for\r\nfood, but is used externally in medicine; he represents the seeds as\r\nextremely purgative. There is a tolerably correct figure of _Ricinus_\r\nin the famous MS. Dioscorides which was executed for the Empress\r\nJuliana Anicia in A.D. 505, and is now preserved in the Imperial\r\nLibrary at Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe castor oil plant was cultivated by Albertus Magnus, Bishop of\r\nRatisbon, in the middle of the 13th century.[2108] It was well known as\r\na garden plant in the time of Turner (1568), who mentions the oil as\r\n_Oleum cicinum vel ricininum_.[2109] Gerarde, at the end of the same\r\ncentury, was familiar with it under the name of _Ricinus_ or _Kik_. The\r\noil he says is called _Oleum cicinum_ or _Oleum de Cherua_,[2110] and\r\nused externally in skin diseases.\r\n\r\nAfter this period the oil seems to have fallen into complete\r\nneglect, and is not even noticed in the comprehensive and accurate\r\n_Pharmacologia_ of Dale (1693). In the time of Hill (1751) and Lewis\r\n(1761) Palma Christi seeds were rarely found in the shops, and the oil\r\nfrom them was scarcely known.[2111]\r\n\r\nIn 1764 Peter Canvane, a physician who had practised many years in the\r\nWest Indies, published a “_Dissertation on the Oleum Palmæ Christi,\r\nsive Oleum Ricini; or (as it is commonly call’d) Castor Oil_,”[2112]\r\nstrongly recommending its use as a gentle purgative. This essay, which\r\npassed through two editions, and was translated into French, was\r\nfollowed by several others,[2113] thus thoroughly drawing attention to\r\nthe value of the oil. Accordingly we find that the seeds of _Ricinus_\r\nwere admitted to the London Pharmacopœia of 1788, and directions given\r\nfor preparing oil from them. Woodville in his _Medical Botany_ (1790)\r\nspeaks of the oil as having “_lately come into frequent use_.”\r\n\r\nAt this period and for several years subsequently, the small supplies\r\nof the seeds and oil required for European medicine were obtained from\r\nJamaica.[2114] This oil was gradually displaced in the market by that\r\nproduced in the East Indies: the rapidity with which the consumption\r\nincreased may be inferred from the following figures, representing\r\nthe value of the Castor Oil shipped to Great Britain from Bengal in\r\nthree several years, namely 1813-14, £610; 1815-16, £1269; 1819-20,\r\n£7102.[2115]\r\n\r\n[2108] _De Vegetabilibus_, ed. Jessen, 1867. 347.\r\n\r\n[2109] Turner’s _Herbal_, pt. ii. 116.\r\n\r\n[2110] From the Arabic _khirva_, _i.e._ Palma Christi.\r\n\r\n[2111] Hill, _Hist. of the Mat.

Med._, Lond. 1761. 468.\r\n\r\n[2112] The word _castor_ in connection with the seeds and oil of\r\n_Ricinus_ has come to us from Jamaica, in which island, by some strange\r\nmistake, the plant was once called _Agnus Castus_. The true Agnus\r\nCastus (_Vitex Agnus castus_ L.) is a native of the Mediterranean\r\ncountries and not of the West Indies.\r\n\r\n[2113] For a list of which consult Mérat et De Lens, _Dict. de Mat.\r\nMéd._ vi. (1834) 95.\r\n\r\n[2114] How small was the traffic in Castor Oil in those days, may be\r\njudged from the fact that the stock in 1777 of a London wholesale\r\ndruggist (Joseph Gurney Bevan, predecessor of Allen and Hanburys) was\r\n2 Bottles (1 Bottle = 18 to 20 ounces) valued at 8_s._ per bottle. The\r\naccounts of the same house show at stocktaking in 1782, 23 Bottles of\r\nthe oil, which had cost 10_s._ per bottle. In 1799 Jamaica exported 236\r\nCasks of Castor Oil and 10 Casks of seeds (Renny, _Hist. of Jamaica_,\r\n1807. 235).\r\n\r\n[2115] H. H. Wilson, _Review of the External Commerce of Bengal from\r\n1813 to 1828_, Calcutta, 1830, tables pp. 14-15.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit of _Ricinus_ is a tricoccous capsule, usually\r\nprovided with weak prickles, containing one seed in each of its three\r\ncells. The seeds attain a length of ³/₁₀ to ⁶/₁₀, and a maximum breadth\r\nof ⁴/₁₀ of an inch, and are of a compressed ellipsoid form. The apex of\r\nthe seed is prolonged into a short beak, on the inner side of which\r\nis a large tumid caruncle: from this latter proceeds the raphe as far\r\nas the lower end of the ventral surface, where it forks, its point of\r\ndisappearance through the testa being marked by a minute protuberance.\r\nIf the caruncle is broken off, a black scar, formed of two little\r\ndepressions, remains.\r\n\r\nThe shining grey epidermis is beautifully marked with brownish bands\r\nand spots, and in this respect exhibits a great variety of colours and\r\nmarkings. It cannot be rubbed off, but may after maceration be peeled\r\noff in leathery strips. The black testa, grey within, is not thicker\r\nthan in croton seed, but is much more brittle. The kernel or nucleus\r\nfills the testa completely, and is easily separated, still covered by\r\nthe soft white inner membrane.\r\n\r\nThe kernel in respect to structure and situation of the embryo, agrees\r\nexactly with that of _Croton Tiglium_ (p. 565), excepting that the\r\nsomewhat gaping cotyledons of _Ricinus_ are proportionately broader,\r\nand have their thick midrib provided with 2 or 3 pairs of lateral\r\nveins. If not rancid, the kernel has a bland taste, with but very\r\nslight acridity.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The thin epidermis consists of pentagonal or\r\nhexagonal porous tabular cells, the walls of which are penetrated\r\nin certain spots by brownish colouring matter, whence the singular\r\nmarkings on the seed. It is these cells only that become blackened when\r\na thin tangential slice is saturated with a solution of ferric chloride\r\nin alcohol.\r\n\r\nBeneath these tabular cells there is found in the unripe seed[2116] a\r\nrow of encrusted colourless cells, deposited in a radial direction on\r\nthe testa. In the mature seed this layer of cells is not perceptible,\r\nand therefore appears to perish as the seed ripens. The testa itself is\r\nbuilt up of cylindrical, densely packed cells, 300 to 320 mkm. long,\r\nand 6 to 10 mkm. in diameter. The kernel shares the structure of that\r\nof _C. Tiglium_, but is devoid of crystals of oxalate of calcium. If\r\nthe endopleura of _Ricinus_ is moistened with dilute sulphuric acid,\r\nacicular crystals of sulphate of calcium separate from it after a few\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nWhen thin slices of the kernel are examined under concentrated\r\nglycerin, no drops of oil are visible, notwithstanding the abundance\r\nof this latter; and it becomes conspicuous only by addition of much\r\nwater. Hence it is probable that the oil exists in the seed as a kind\r\nof compound with its albuminoid contents.[2117] As to the latter,\r\nthey partly form in the albumen of _Ricinus_ beautiful octohedra or\r\ntetrahedra, which are also found in many other seeds.[2118]\r\n\r\n[2116] Gris, _Annales des Sciences Nat._, Bot., xv. (1861) 5-9.\r\n\r\n[2117] Sachs, _Lehrbuch der Botanik_, 1874. 54.\r\n\r\n[2118] For further particulars, see Trécul, _Ann. des Sc. Nat._, Bot.,\r\nx.,(1858) 355; Radlkofer, _Krystalle proteinartiger Körper_, Leipzig,\r\n1859. 61. and tab. 2 fig. 10; Pfeffer, _Proteïnkörner_ in Pringsheim’s\r\n_Jahrbücher für wissenschaftliche Botanik_, viii. (1872) 429. 464.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most important constituent of the seed is\r\nthe fixed oil, called _Castor Oil_, of which the peeled kernels afford\r\nat most half of their weight.\r\n\r\nThe oil, if most carefully prepared from peeled and winnowed seeds by\r\npressure without heat, has but a slightly acrid taste, and contains\r\nonly a very small proportion of the still unknown drastic constituent\r\nof the seeds. Hence the seeds themselves, or an emulsion prepared with\r\nthem, act much more strongly than a corresponding quantity of oil.\r\nCastor oil, extracted by absolute alcohol or by bisulphide of carbon,\r\nlikewise purges much more vehemently than the pressed oil.\r\n\r\nThe castor oil of commerce has a sp. gr. of about 0·96, usually a pale\r\nyellow tint, a viscid consistence, and a very slight yet rather mawkish\r\nodour and taste. Exposed to cold, it does not in general entirely\r\nsolidify until the temperature reaches -18° C. In thin layers it dries\r\nup to varnish-like film.\r\n\r\nCastor oil is distinguished by its power of mixing in all proportions\r\nwith glacial acetic acid or absolute alcohol. It is even soluble in\r\nfour parts of spirit of wine (·838) at 15° C., and mixes without\r\nturbidity with an equal weight of the same solvent at 25° C. The\r\ncommercial varieties of the oil however differ considerably in these as\r\nwell as in some other respects.\r\n\r\nThe optical properties of the oil demand further investigation, as we\r\nhave found that some samples deviate the ray of polarized light to the\r\nright and others to the left.\r\n\r\nBy saponification castor oil yields several fatty acids, one of which\r\nappears to be _Palmitic Acid_. The prevailing acid (peculiar to the\r\noil) is _Ricinoleic Acid_, C₁₈H₃₄O₃; it is solid below 0° C., does\r\nnot solidify in contact with the air by absorption of oxygen, and is\r\nnot homologous with oleic or linoleic acid, neither of which is found\r\nin castor oil. Castor oil is nevertheless thickened if 6 parts of it\r\nare warmed with 1 part of starch and 5 of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1·25),\r\n_Ricinelaïdin_ being thus formed. From this _Ricinelaïdic Acid_ may\r\neasily be obtained in brilliant crystals.\r\n\r\nAs to the albuminoid matter of the seed, Fleury (1865) obtained 3·23\r\nper cent. of nitrogen which would answer to about 20 per cent. of such\r\nsubstances. The same chemist further extracted 46·6 per cent. of fixed\r\noil, 2·2 of sugar and mucilage, besides 18 per cent. of cellulose.\r\n\r\nTuson in 1864, by exhausting castor oil seeds with boiling water,\r\nobtained from them an alkaloid which he named _Ricinine_. He states\r\nthat it crystallizes in rectangular prisms and tables, which when\r\nheated fuse, and upon cooling solidify as a crystalline mass; the\r\ncrystals may even be sublimed. Ricinine dissolves readily in water or\r\nalcohol, less freely in ether or benzol. With mercuric chloride, it\r\ncombines to form tufts of silky crystals, soluble in water or alcohol.\r\nWerner (1869) on repeating Tuson’s process on 30 lb. of Italian castor\r\noil seeds, also obtained a crop of crystals, which in appearance\r\nand solubility had many of the characters ascribed to ricinine, but\r\ndiffered in the essential point that when incinerated they left a\r\nresiduum of magnesia. Werner regarded them as the magnesium salt of a\r\nnew acid. Tuson[2119] repudiates the suspicion that ricinine may be\r\nidentical with Werner’s magnesium compound. E. S. Wayne of Cincinnati\r\n(1874) found in the leaves of _Ricinus_ a substance apparently\r\nidentical with Tuson’s ricinine; but he considers that it has no claim\r\nto be called an alkaloid.\r\n\r\n[2119] _Chemical News_, xxii. (1870) 229.\r\n\r\nThe testa of castor oil seeds afforded us 10·7 per cent. of ash, one\r\ntenth of which we found to consist of silica. The ash of the kernel\r\npreviously dried at 100 C. amounts to only 3·5 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—Castor oil is most extensively produced in\r\nIndia, where two varieties of the seeds, the large and the small, are\r\ndistinguished, the latter being considered to yield the better product.\r\nIn manufacturing the oil, the seeds are gentry crushed between rollers,\r\nand freed by hand from husks and unsound grains. At Calcutta, 100 parts\r\nof seed yield on an average 70 parts of cleaned kernels, which by the\r\nhydraulic press afford 46 to 51 per cent. of their weight of oil; the\r\noil is afterwards subjected to a very imperfect process of purification\r\nby heating it with water.[2120]\r\n\r\nThe exports of castor oil from Calcutta[2121] in the year 1870-71\r\namounted to 654,917 gallons, of which 214,959 gallons were shipped to\r\nthe United Kingdom. The total imports of castor oil into the United\r\nKingdom[2122] in the year 1870 were returned as 36,986 cwt. (about\r\n416,000 gallons), valued at £82,490. Of this quantity, British India\r\n(chiefly Bengal) furnished about two-thirds; and Italy 11,856 cwt.\r\n(about 133,000 gallons), while a small remainder is entered as from\r\n“other parts.” In 1876 the imports were 79,677 cwt., valued at £133,838.\r\n\r\n_Italian Castor Oil_, which has of late risen into some celebrity, is\r\npressed from the seed of plants grown chiefly about Verona and Legnago,\r\nin the north of Italy. The manufactory of Mr. Bellino Valeri at the\r\nlatter town produced in the year 1873, 1200 quintals of castor oil,\r\nentirely from Italian seed. Two varieties of _Ricinus_ are cultivated\r\nin these localities, the black-seeded Egyptian and the red-seeded\r\nAmerican; the latter yields the larger percentage, but the oil is not\r\nso pale in colour. The seeds are very carefully deprived of their\r\ninteguments, and having been crushed, are submitted to pressure in\r\npowerful hydraulic presses, placed in a room which in winter is heated\r\nto about 21° C. The outflow of oil is further promoted by plates of\r\niron warmed to 32-38° C. being placed between the press-bags. The\r\npeeled seeds yield about 40 per cent. of oil.[2123]\r\n\r\nAll the castor oil pressed in Italy is not pressed from Italian seed.\r\nBy an official return[2124] it appears that in the year 1872-73 there\r\nwere exported from Bombay to Genoa 1350 cwt. of castor oil seeds,\r\nbesides 2452 gallons of castor oil. There are no data to show what was\r\nexported from the other presidencies of India in that year.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Castor oil is much valued as a mild and safe purgative; while\r\nthe commoner qualities are used in soap-making, and in India for\r\nburning in lamps. The seeds are not now administered. The _leaves_ of\r\nthe plant applied in decoction to the breasts of women are said to\r\npromote or even to occasion the secretion of milk. This property, which\r\nhas long been known to the inhabitants of the Cape Verd Islands,[2125]\r\nwas particularly observed by Dr. M’William about the year 1850. It has\r\neven been found that the galactagogue powers of the plant are exerted\r\nwhen the leaves are administered internally.\r\n\r\n[2120] _Madras Exhibition of Raw Products, etc. of Southern\r\nIndia_,—Reports by the Juries, Madras, 1856. 28.\r\n\r\n[2121] _Annual Volume of Trade and Navigation for the Bengal Presidency\r\nfor 1870-71_, Calcutta, 1871. 119.\r\n\r\n[2122] _Annual Statement of the Trade, etc. of the U.K. for 1870._—No\r\nlater returns.\r\n\r\n[2123] H.

It grows in Abyssinia\r\nand Southern Arabia, throughout the Indian peninsulas, ascending the\r\nmountains to 5000 feet above the sea-level, in Ceylon, the Malay\r\nArchipelago, the Philippines, the Loochoo islands, Formosa, Eastern\r\nChina and in North Australia, Queensland and New South Wales.\r\n\r\nThe tricoccous fruits of many of the _Euphorbiaceæ_ are clothed with\r\nprickles, stellate hairs, or easily removed glands. This is especially\r\nthe case in the several species of _Mallotus_, most of which have the\r\ncapsules covered with stellate hairs, together with small glands. In\r\nthat under notice, the capsule is closely beset with ruby-like glands\r\nwhich, when removed by brushing and rubbing, constitute the powder\r\nknown by the Bengali name of _Kamala_. These glands are not confined\r\nto the capsule, but are scattered over other parts of the plant,\r\nespecially among the dense tomentum with which the under side of the\r\nleaf is covered.\r\n\r\n=History=—In India the glands of Mallotus have been long known, for\r\nthey have several ancient Sanskrit names: one of these is _Kapila_,\r\nwhich as well as the Telugu _Kapila-podi_, is sometimes used by\r\nEuropeans, though not so frequently as the word _Kamala_ or _Kamela_,\r\nwhich belongs to the Hindustani, Bengali and Guzratti languages. The\r\nSanskrit word _Kapila_ signifies tawny or dusky red, the Tamil _Podi_\r\nmeans the pollen of a flower or dust in general.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that as a drug the glandular powder of _Mallotus_,\r\nor as it is more conveniently called, _Kamala_, attracted any\r\nparticular notice in Europe until a very recent period, though it is\r\nnamed by Ainslie, Roxburgh, Royle and Buchanan, the last of whom gives\r\nan interesting account of its collection and uses.[2127] In 1852,\r\nspecimens of it as found in the bazaar of Aden, under the old Arabic\r\nname of _Wars_, were sent to one of us by Port-Surgeon Vaughan, with\r\ninformation as to its properties as a dye for a silk and as a remedy\r\nin cutaneous diseases.[2128] But the real introduction of the drug as\r\na useful medicine is due to Mackinnon, surgeon in the Bengal Medical\r\nEstablishment, who administered it successively in numerous cases of\r\ntapeworm. Anderson of Calcutta, C. A. Gordon, and Corbyn in India, and\r\nLeared in London, confirmed the observations of Mackinnon, and fully\r\nestablished the fact that kamala is an efficient taenifuge.[2129] It\r\nwas introduced into the _British Pharmacopœia_ in 1864.\r\n\r\n[2126] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen’s _Med.

Ibn Khurdádbah,\r\nan Arab geographer, living A.D. 869-885, states that from Yemen come\r\nstriped silks, ambergris, _wars_, and gum.[2132] It is described to\r\nbe a reddish yellow powder like sand, which falls on the ground in\r\nthe valleys of Yemen, and is a good remedy for tapeworm and cutaneous\r\ndiseases. One writer compares it to powdered saffron; another speaks of\r\ntwo kinds,—an Abyssinian which is _black_ (or violet), and an Indian\r\nwhich is _red_. Masudi,[2133] in the first half of the 10th century\r\nspeaks of _qinbil_, which he says consists of sandy fruits of red\r\nhue. They are useful as an anthelminthic and for cutaneous diseases.\r\nA similar explanation of the qinbil is found in Qamus, a dictionary\r\nwriter in the 13th century in Yemen. About the year 1216, a learned\r\ntraveller, Abul Abbas Ahmad Annabati,[2134] (Annabati = the botanist)\r\nor Abul Abbas el-Nebáti, who was a native of Seville, remarks that\r\nthe drug is known in the Hejaz and brought from Yemen, but that it is\r\nunknown in Andalusia and does not grow there.\r\n\r\nKazwini,[2135] nearly at the same period, was also acquainted with\r\n_wars_, a plant _sown_ in Yemen and resembling Sesam; Constantinus\r\nAfricanus likewise mentioned “_huars_.” Wars, Wors, Wurrus or Warras in\r\nArabia properly signifies saffron.\r\n\r\nIn modern times, we find Niebuhr[2136] speaks of the same substance\r\n(as “_wars_”), stating it to be a dye-stuff, of which quantities are\r\nconveyed from Mokha to Oman.\r\n\r\n=Production=—Kamala is one of the minor products of the Government\r\nforests in the Madras Presidency, but is also collected in many other\r\nparts of India. The following particulars have been communicated to us\r\nby a correspondent[2137] in the North-west Provinces:—\r\n\r\n“ ... Enormous quantities of _Rottlera tinctoria_ are found growing\r\nat the foot of these hills, and every season numbers of people,\r\nchiefly women and children, are engaged in collecting the powder for\r\nexportation to the plains. They gather the berries in large quantities\r\nand throw them into a great basket in which they roll them about,\r\nrubbing them with their hands so as to divest them of the powder, which\r\nfalls through the basket as through a sieve, and is received below\r\non a cloth spread for the purpose. This powder forms the _Kamala_ of\r\ncommerce, and is in great repute as an anthelminthic, but is most\r\nextensively used as a dye. The adulterations are chiefly the powdered\r\nleaves, and the fruit-stalks with a little earthy matter, but the\r\npercentage is not large. The operations of picking the fruit and\r\nrubbing off the powder commence here in the beginning of March and last\r\nabout a month....”\r\n\r\n[2130] Adams’ translat. iii. 457.\r\n\r\n[2131] Quoted by Ibn Baytar,—see Sontheimer’s translation, ii.

Matthews, Esq., of Nainee Tal.\r\n\r\nA similar powder is collected in Southern Arabia, whence it is shipped\r\nto the Persian Gulf and Bombay. It is also brought, under the name of\r\n_Wars_, from Hurrur, a town in Eastern Africa, which is a great trading\r\nstation between the Galla countries and Berbera.[2138] Yet the Arabian\r\nand African drug consists in most cases not of kamala, but of those\r\ndark glands which we describe further on, at p. 575.\r\n\r\n[2138] Burton, _Journ. of R. Geogr. Society_, xxv. (1855) 146.\r\nHaggenmacher, _Reise in das Somaliland_, in Petermann’s _Geogr.\r\nMittheilungen_, Ergänzungsheft, xlvii. (1874) 39.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Kamala is a fine, granular, mobile powder, consisting of\r\ntransparent, crimson granules, the bright colour of which is mostly\r\nsomewhat deadened by the admixture of grey stellate hairs, minute\r\nfragments of leaves and similar foreign matter. It is nearly destitute\r\nof taste and smell, but an alcoholic solution poured into water emits\r\na melon-like odour. Kamala is scarcely acted on by water, even at a\r\nboiling heat; on the other hand, alcohol, ether, chloroform or benzol\r\nextract from it a splendid red resin. Neither sulphuric nor nitric acid\r\nacts upon it in the cold, nor does oil of turpentine become coloured by\r\nit unless warmed. It floats on water, but sinks in oil of turpentine.\r\nWhen sprinkled over a flame, it ignites after the manner of lycopodium.\r\nHeated alone, it emits a slight aromatic odour; if pure, it leaves\r\nafter incineration about 1·37 per cent. of a grey ash.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The granules of kamala are irregular spherical\r\nglands, 50 to 60 mkm. in diameter; they have a wavy surface, are\r\nsomewhat flattened or depressed on one side, and enclose within their\r\ndelicate yellowish membrane a structureless yellow mass in which are\r\nimbedded numerous, simple, club-shaped cells containing a homogeneous,\r\ntransparent, red substance. These cells are grouped in a radiate manner\r\naround the centre of the flattened side, so that on the side next the\r\nobserver, 10 to 30 of them may easily be counted, while the entire\r\ngland may contain 40 to 60. In a few cases, a very short stalk-cell is\r\nalso seen at the centre of the base.\r\n\r\nWhen the glands are exhausted by alcohol and potash, and broken by\r\npressure between flat pieces of glass, they separate into individual\r\ncells which swell up slightly, while the membranous envelope is\r\ncompletely detached, and appears as a simple coherent film. After\r\nthis treatment the cells, but not their membranous envelope, acquire\r\nby prolonged contact with strong sulphuric acid and iodine water\r\na more or less brown or blue colour: the walls of the cells alone\r\ncorrespond therefore to cellulose. Vogl (1864) supposes that a cell of\r\nthe epidermis of the fruit first develops a young cellule, which by\r\npartition is resolved into the stalk-cell and the true mother-cell of\r\nthe small clavate resin-cellules. At first, the contents of the latter\r\ndo not differ from the mass in which they are imbedded, and perhaps\r\npass gradually into resin by metamorphosis of the cellular substance.\r\n\r\nThe glands of kamala are always accompanied by colourless or brownish,\r\nthick-walled, stellate hairs, two or three times as long as the glands,\r\noften containing air, which do not exhibit any peculiarity of form, but\r\nresemble the hairs of other plants, as _Verbascum_ or _Althæa_.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Kamala has been analysed by Anderson of Glasgow\r\n(1855) and by Leube (1860). From the labours of these chemists, it\r\nappears that the powder yields to alcohol or ether nearly 80 per cent.\r\nof resin. We find it to be soluble also in glacial acetic acid or in\r\nbisulphide of carbon, not in petroleum ether. By treatment of the resin\r\nextracted by ether with cold alcohol, Leube resolved it into two\r\nbrittle reddish yellow resins, of which the one is more easily soluble\r\nand fuses at 80° C., and the other dissolves less readily and fuses at\r\n191°. Both dissolve in alkaline solutions, and can be precipitated by\r\nacids without apparent change.\r\n\r\nAnderson found that a concentrated ethereal solution of kamala\r\nallowed to stand for a few days, solidified into a mass of granular\r\ncrystals, which by repeated solution and crystallization in ether\r\nwere obtained in a state of purity. This substance, named by Anderson\r\n_Rottlerin_,[2139] forms minute, platy, yellow crystals of a fine\r\nsatiny lustre, readily soluble in ether, sparingly in cold alcohol,\r\nmore so in hot, and insoluble in water. The mean of four analyses gave\r\nthe composition of rottlerin as C₂₂H₂₀O₆.\r\n\r\nWe have been able to confirm the foregoing observations so far as that\r\nwe have obtained an abundance of minute acicular crystals, by allowing\r\nan ethereal solution of kamala to evaporate spontaneously to a syrupy\r\nstate. But the purification of these crystals, which was also attempted\r\nby our friend Mr. T. B. Groves,[2140] was unsuccessful, for when freed\r\nfrom the protecting mother-liquor, they underwent a change and assumed\r\nan amorphous form. We have, on the other hand, succeeded in isolating\r\nthe crystals from the “_Kamalin_,” as sold by E. Merck of Darmstadt. By\r\nfusing them with caustic potash we obtained paraoxy-benzoic acid (see\r\npage 408).\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The drug is administered for the expulsion of tapeworm; it has\r\nalso been used as an external application in _herpes circinnatus_. In\r\nIndia it is employed for dyeing silk a rich orange-brown.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Kamala is very liable to adulteration with earthy\r\nsubstances, even to the extent of 60 per cent. This contamination may\r\neasily be known by the grittiness of the drug, and by a portion of it\r\nsinking when it is stirred up with water, but in the most decisive\r\nmanner by incineration. Sometimes kamala contains an undue proportion\r\nof foreign vegetable matter, as remains of the capsules, leaves, etc.,\r\nwhich can partly be separated by a lawn sieve. We have met with a large\r\nquantity of very impure Kamala in the London market (1878), which was\r\noffered for cleaning polished metallic surfaces.\r\n\r\n=Substitute=—A very remarkable form of so-called kamala was imported\r\nin 1867 from Aden by Messrs. Allen and Hanburys, druggists, of\r\nLondon.[2141] It arrived neatly packed in oblong, white calico bags,\r\nof three sizes, each inscribed with Arabic characters, indicating\r\nwith the name of the vendor or collector, a native of Hurrur, the net\r\nweight, which was either 100, 50, or 25 Turkish ounces. No more than\r\ntwo supplies, in all 136 lb., could be obtained.\r\n\r\n[2139] See _Science Papers_, 78.\r\n\r\n[2140] _Yearbook of Pharmacy_, 1872. 599.\r\n\r\n[2141] It has been particularly described by one of us in _Pharm.\r\nJourn._ ix. (1868) 279, with woodcuts.\r\n\r\nThe drug was in coarser particles than kamala, of a deep purple, and\r\nhad a distinct odour resembling that which is produced when a tincture\r\nof kamala is poured into water. It had been carefully collected and was\r\nfree from earthy admixture, yet it left upon incineration 12 per cent.\r\nof ash. Under the microscope it presented still greater differences,\r\nthe grains being cylindrical or subconical, 170 to 200 mkm. long,\r\nby 70 to 100 mkm. broad, with _oblong_ resin-cells, arranged\r\nperpendicularly in three or four storeys; mixed with the grains were\r\na few long, simple hairs. Another fact of some interest is, that at a\r\ntemperature of 93° to 100° C., this drug becomes quite black, while\r\nkamala undergoes no change of colour.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 our friend Professor Schär was informed by a Swiss firm,\r\nMessrs. Furrer and Escher of Aden, that Kanbil, Qinbil or Kamala are\r\nunknown there. But they sent under the name of _Vars_ a powder, which\r\nProf. Schär as well as one of us (F.) find identical with the drug\r\nwhich had been imported by Messrs. Allen and Hanbury. Prof. Schär was\r\nalso informed that Vars is used chiefly in the coast districts of\r\nMascat (Oman) and Hadramaut, in skin diseases, for expelling the tape\r\nworm and as a dye.\r\n\r\nThus the appellation Wurrus or Waras is to be restricted to the dark\r\npurple or violet glands occurring in eastern Africa and Yemen, although\r\nthe Waras sent to one of us[2142] by Vaughan was kamala.\r\n\r\nAs to the mother plant of Waras[2143] we have no information to offer;\r\nwe attempted in vain to ascertain its origin. It is evident that it is\r\nthe “black Abyssinian” powder already alluded to at page 573.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIPERACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS PIPERIS NIGRI.\r\n\r\n_Piper nigrum_; _Black Pepper_; F. _Poivre noir_; G. _Schwarzer\r\nPfeffer_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Piper nigrum_ L.—The pepper plant is a perennial\r\nclimbing shrub, with jointed stems branching dichotomously, and broadly\r\novate, 5-to 7-nerved, stalked leaves. The slender flower-spikes are\r\nopposite the leaves, stalked, and from 3 to 6 inches long; and the\r\nfruits are sessile and fleshy.\r\n\r\n_Piper nigrum_ is indigenous to the forests of Travancore and Malabar,\r\nwhence it has been introduced into Sumatra, Java, Borneo, the Malay\r\nPeninsula, Siam, the Philippines and the West Indies.\r\n\r\n=History=—Pepper[2144] is one of the spices earliest used by mankind,\r\nand although now a commodity of but small importance in comparison with\r\nsugar, coffee, and cotton, it was for many ages the staple article\r\nof trade between Europe and India. It would require in fact a volume\r\nto give a full idea of the prominent importance of pepper during the\r\nmiddle ages.\r\n\r\nIn the 4th century B.C., Theophrastus noticed the existence of two\r\nkinds of pepper (πέπερι), probably the _Black Pepper_ and _Long Pepper_\r\nof modern times. Dioscorides stated pepper to be a production of\r\nIndia, and was acquainted with _White Pepper_ (λευκὸν πέπερι). Pliny’s\r\ninformation on the same subject is curious; he tells us that in his\r\ntime a pound of long pepper was worth 15, of white 7, and of black\r\npepper 4 _denarii_; and expresses his astonishment that mankind should\r\nso highly esteem pepper, which was neither a sweet taste nor attractive\r\nappearance, or any desirable quality besides a certain pungency.\r\n\r\n[2142] Hanbury, _Science Papers_, 73.\r\n\r\n[2143] Some information will be met with in Capt. Hunter’s _Account of\r\nAden_, 1877. p. 107. In 1875-1876 there were exported from Aden 42,975\r\nlb. of Waras.\r\n\r\n[2144] The word _pepper_, which with slight varieties has passed into\r\nalmost all languages, comes from the Sanskrit name for _Long Pepper_,\r\n_pippali_, the change of the _l_ into _r_ having been made by the\r\nPersians, in whose ancient language the _l_ is wanting.\r\n\r\nIn the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea, written about A.D. 64, it is\r\nstated that pepper is exported from Baraké, the shipping place of\r\nNelkunda, in which region, and there only, it grows in great quantity.\r\nThese have been identified with places on the Malabar Coast between\r\nMangalore and Calicut.[2145]\r\n\r\nLong pepper and Black pepper are among the Indian spices on which the\r\nRomans levied duty at Alexandria about A.D. 176.[2146]\r\n\r\nCosmas Indicopleustes,[2147] a merchant, and in later life a monk,\r\nwho wrote about A.D. 540, appears to have visited the Malabar Coast,\r\nor at all events had some information about the pepper plant from an\r\neye-witness. It is he who furnishes the first particulars about it,\r\nstating that it is a climbing plant, sticking close to high trees like\r\na vine. Its native country he calls _Male_.[2148] The Arabian authors\r\nof the middle ages, as Ibn Khurdádbah (_circa_ A.D. 869-885), Edrisi in\r\nthe middle of the 12th, and Ibn Batuta in the 14th century, furnished\r\nnearly similar accounts.\r\n\r\nAmong Europeans who described the pepper plant with some exactness,\r\none of the first was Benjamin of Tudela, who visited the Malabar Coast\r\nin A.D. 1166. Another was the Catalan friar, Jordanus,[2149] about\r\n1330; he described the plant as something like ivy, climbing trees and\r\nforming fruit, like that of the wild vine. “This fruit,” he says, “is\r\nat first green, then, when it comes to maturity, black.” Nearly the\r\nsame statements are repeated by Nicolo Conti, a Venetian, who at the\r\nbeginning of the 15th century, spent twenty-five years in the East.\r\nHe observed the plant in Sumatra, and also described it as resembling\r\nivy.[2150]\r\n\r\nIn Europe, pepper during the middle ages was the most esteemed and\r\nimportant of all spices, and the very symbol of the spice trade, to\r\nwhich Venice,[2151] Genoa, and the commercial cities of Central Europe\r\nwere indebted for a large part of their wealth; and its importance as a\r\nmeans of promoting commercial activity during the middle ages, and the\r\ncivilizing intercourse of nation with nation, can scarcely be overrated.\r\n\r\n[2145] Vincent, _Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients_, ii.

Jahrhundert_, München\r\n(1863) 40.\r\n\r\n[2151] In the beginning of the 15th century the great emporium of\r\nthe trade in pepper appears to have been the vicinity of the Church\r\nS. Giacomo de Rialto at Venice. In the “capitolare dei Visdomini del\r\nfontego dei Todeschi (German court) in Venezia,” edit. of Thomas,\r\nBerlin, 1874, the chapter 228, page 116, is devoted to “_La mercadantia\r\ndel pevere_.”\r\n\r\nTribute was levied in pepper,[2152] and donations were made of this\r\nspice, which was often used as a medium of exchange when money was\r\nscarce. During the siege of Rome by Alaric, king of the Goths, A.D.\r\n408, the ransom demanded from the city included among other things\r\n5000 pounds of gold, 30,000 pounds of silver, and 3000 pounds of\r\n_pepper_.[2153] After the conquest of Cæsarea in Palestine, A.D. 1101,\r\nby the Genoese, each of them received two pounds of pepper and 48 soldi\r\nfor his part of the booty.[2154] Facts of this nature, of which a great\r\nnumber might be enumerated, sufficiently illustrate the part played by\r\nthis spice in mediæval times.\r\n\r\nThe general prevalence during the middle ages of _pepper-rents_, which\r\nconsisted in an obligation imposed upon a tenant to supply his lord\r\nwith a certain quantity of pepper, generally a pound, at stated times,\r\nshows how acceptable was this favourite condiment, and how great the\r\ndesire of the wealthier classes to secure a supply of it when the\r\nmarket was not always certain.[2155]\r\n\r\nThe earliest reference to a trade in pepper in England that we have met\r\nwith, is in the Statutes of Ethelred, A.D. 978-1016,[2156] where it is\r\nenacted that the Easterlings coming with their ships to Billingsgate\r\nshould pay at Christmas and Easter for the privilege of trading with\r\nLondon, a small tribute of cloth, five pairs of gloves, _ten pounds of\r\npepper_,[2157] and two barrels of vinegar.\r\n\r\nThe merchants who trafficked in spices were called _Piperarii_,—in\r\nEnglish _Pepperers_, in French _Poivriers_ or _Pebriers_. As a\r\nfraternity or guild, they are mentioned as existing in London in\r\nthe Reign of Henry II. (A.D. 1154-1189). They were subsequently\r\nincorporated as the Grocers’ Company, and had the oversight and control\r\nof the trade in spices, drugs, dye-stuffs, and even metals.[2158]\r\n\r\nThe price of pepper during the middle ages was always exorbitantly\r\nhigh, for the rulers of Egypt extorted a large revenue from all those\r\nwho were engaged in the trade in it and other spices.[2159] Thus\r\nin England between A.D. 1263 and 1399, it averaged 1_s._ per lb.,\r\nequivalent to about 8_s._ of our present money. It was however about\r\n2_s._ per lb. (= 16_s._) between 1350 and 1360.[2160] In 1370 we find\r\npepper in France valued 7 sous 6 deniers per lb. (= fr. 21. c. 30):—in\r\n1542 at a price equal to fr. 11 per lb.[2161]\r\n\r\nThe high cost of this important condiment contributed to incite the\r\nPortuguese to seek for a sea-passage to India. It was some time after\r\nthe discovery of this passage (A.D. 1498) that the price of pepper\r\nfirst experienced a considerable fall; while about the same period the\r\ncultivation of the plant was extended to the western islands of the\r\nMalay Archipelago. The trade in pepper continued to be a monopoly of\r\nthe Crown of Portugal as late as the 18th century.\r\n\r\n[2152] For some examples of this, see _Histoire de la vie privée des\r\nFrançais_, par le Grand d’Aussy, nouvelle éd., ii.

Strange to say, they\r\nwere received with great mistrust!\r\n\r\nPepper was heavily taxed in England. In 1623 the imposts levied on it\r\namounted to 5_s._ per lb.; and even down to 1823 it was subject to a\r\nduty of 2_s._ 6_d._ per lb.\r\n\r\n=Production=—In the south-west of India, the plant, or _Pepper Vine_\r\nas it is called, grows on the sides of the narrow valleys where the\r\nsoil is rich and moist, producing lofty trees by which a constant,\r\nfavourable coolness is maintained. In such places the pepper-vine runs\r\nalong the ground and propagates itself by striking out roots into the\r\nsoil. The natives tie up the end of the vines lying on the ground to\r\nthe nearest tree, on the bark of which the stems put out roots so far\r\nas they have been tied, the shoots above that hanging down. The plant\r\nis capable of growing to a height of 20 or 30 feet, but for the sake\r\nof convenience it is usually kept low, and is often trained on poles.\r\nIn places where no vines occur naturally, the plant is propagated by\r\nplanting slips near the roots of the trees on which it is to climb.\r\n\r\nThe pepper plants if grown on a rich soil begin to bear even in the\r\nfirst year, and continue to increase in productiveness till about the\r\nfifth, when they yield 8 to 10 lb. of berries per plant, which is about\r\nthe average produce up to the age of 15 to 20 years; after this they\r\nbegin to decline.\r\n\r\nWhen one or two berries at the base of the spike begin to turn red, the\r\nwhole spike is pinched off. Next day the berries are rubbed off with\r\nthe hands and picked clean; then dried for three days on mats, or on\r\nsmooth hard ground, or on bamboo baskets near a gentle fire.\r\n\r\nIn Malabar the pepper-vine flowers in May and June, and the fruits\r\nbecome fit for gathering at the commencement of the following\r\nyear.[2162]\r\n\r\nThe largest quantities of pepper are produced in the island of Rhio,\r\nnear Singapore, in Djohor (in the south-eastern coast of the Malayan\r\nPeninsula), and in Penang. The latter island affords on an average\r\nabout one-half of the total crop.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The small, round, berry-like fruits grow somewhat loosely\r\nto the number of 20 to 30, on a common pendulous fruit-stalk. They are\r\nat first green, then become red, and if allowed to ripen, yellow; but\r\nthey are gathered before complete maturity, and by drying in that state\r\nturn blackish grey or brown. If left until quite ripe they lose some of\r\ntheir pungency, and gradually fall off.\r\n\r\nThe berries after drying are spherical, about ⅕ inch in diameter,\r\nwrinkled on the surface, indistinctly pointed below by the remains of\r\nthe very short pedicel, and crowned still more indistinctly by the 3-or\r\n4-lobed stigma. The thin pericarp tightly encloses a single seed, the\r\nembryo of which in consequence of premature gathering is undeveloped,\r\nand merely replaced by a cavity situated below the apex. The seed\r\nitself contains within the thin red-brown testa a shining albumen, grey\r\nand horny without, and mealy within. The pungent taste and peculiar\r\nsmell of pepper are familiar to all.\r\n\r\n[2162] For a full account of the cultivation of pepper, see Buchanan,\r\n_Journey from Madras through Mysore, Canara, and Malabar_, ii. (1807)\r\n455-520; iii. 158.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The transverse section of a grain of black\r\npepper exhibits a soft yellowish epidermis, covering the outer\r\npericarp. This is formed of a closely-packed yellow layer of large,\r\nmostly radially arranged, thick-walled cells, each containing in its\r\nsmall cavity a mass of dark brown resin. The middle layer of the\r\npericarp consists of soft, tangentially-extended parenchyme, containing\r\nan abundance of extremely small starch granules and drops of oil. The\r\nshrinking of this loose middle layer is the chief cause of the deep\r\nwrinkles on the surface of the berry. The next inner layer of the\r\npericarp exhibits towards its circumference tangentially-arranged,\r\nsoft parenchyme, the cells of which possess either spiral striation or\r\nspiral fibres, but towards the interior loose parenchyme, free from\r\nstarch, and containing very large oil-cells.\r\n\r\nThe testa is formed in the first place of a row of small yellow\r\nthick-walled cells. Next to them follows the true testa, as a dense,\r\ndark brown layer of lignified cells, the individual outlines of which\r\nare undistinguishable.\r\n\r\nThe albumen of the seeds consists of angular, radially-arranged,\r\nlarge-celled parenchyme. Most of its cells are colourless and loaded\r\nwith starch; others contain a soft yellow amorphous mass. If thin\r\nslices are kept under glycerin for some time, these masses are slowly\r\ntransformed into needle-shaped crystals of piperin.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Pepper contains resin and essential oil, to the\r\nformer of which its sharp pungent taste is due. The essential oil has\r\nmore of the smell than of the taste of pepper.[2163] The drug yields\r\nfrom 1·6 to 2·2 per cent. of this volatile oil, which agrees with oil\r\nof turpentine in composition as well as in specific gravity and boiling\r\npoint. We find it, in a column 50 mm. long, to deviate the ray of\r\npolarized light 1°·2 to 3°·4 to the left.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting constituent of pepper, _Piperin_, which pepper\r\nyields to the extent of 2 to 8 per cent., agrees in composition with\r\nthe formula C₁₇H₁₉NO₃, like morphine. Piperin has no action on litmus\r\npaper; it is not capable of combining directly with an acid, yet unites\r\nwith hydrochloric acid in the presence of mercuric and other metallic\r\nchlorides, forming crystallizable compounds. It is insoluble in water;\r\nwhen perfectly pure, its crystals are devoid of colour, taste and\r\nsmell. Its alcoholic solution is without action on polarized light.\r\nPiperin may be resolved, as found by Anderson in 1850, into _Piperic\r\nAcid_, C₁₂H₁₀O₄, and _Piperidine_, C₅H₁₁N. The latter is a liquid\r\ncolourless alkaloid, boiling at 106° C., having the odour of pepper and\r\nammonia, and directly yielding crystallizable salts.\r\n\r\nBesides these constituents, pepper also contains some fatty oil in the\r\nmesocarp. Of inorganic matter, it yields upon incineration from 4·1 to\r\n5·7 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Singapore is the great emporium for pepper, of which 197,478\r\npeculs (26⅓ million lb.) were imported there in 1877. The largest part\r\nof it finds its way to England. The import of pepper into the United\r\nKingdom during 1872, was 27,576,710 lb. valued at £753,970. Of this\r\nquantity, the Straits Settlements supplied 25,000,000 lb., and British\r\nIndia 256,000 lb. Of the quantity of 25,917,070 lb., imported in 1876\r\ninto Great Britain, the home consumption was 9 million lb.\r\n\r\n[2163] As noticed by Rheede in 1688: “ ... oleum ex pipere destillatum\r\nlevem piperis odorem spirans, saporis parum acris.”—_Hort. Malab._\r\nvii. 24.—The oil was however obtained long before by Valerius Cordus,\r\nGuintherus Andernacensis and Porta (see our article Cortex Cinnamomi,\r\npage 526).\r\n\r\nThe exports of pepper from the United Kingdom in 1872 amounted to\r\n17,891,620 lb., the largest quantity being taken by Germany (5,201,574\r\nlb.) Then follows Italy (2,288,647 lb.); and Russia, Holland and Spain,\r\neach of which took more than a million pounds.[2164]\r\n\r\nThe varieties of pepper quoted in price-currents are _Malabar_,\r\n_Aleppee and Cochin_, _Penang_, _Singapore_, _Siam_.\r\n\r\nA large quantity is also shipped from Singapore to China, the imports\r\nof that country in 1877 of both black and white pepper, being 53,844\r\npeculs (7,179,200 lb.)\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Pepper is not of much importance as a medicine, and is rarely if\r\never prescribed, except indirectly as an ingredient of some preparation.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Whole pepper is not, we believe, liable in Europe to\r\nadulteration;[2165] but the case is widely different as regards the\r\npulverized spice. Notwithstanding the enormous penalty of £100, to\r\nwhich the manufacturer, possessor, or seller of adulterated pepper\r\nis liable,[2166] and the low cost of the article, ground pepper has\r\nhitherto been frequently sophisticated by the addition of the starches\r\nof cereals and potatoes, of sago, mustard husks, linseed and capsicum.\r\nThe admixture of these substances may for the most part be readily\r\ndetected, after some practice, by the microscope.[2167]\r\n\r\nWhite Pepper.\r\n\r\nThis form of the spice is prepared from black pepper by removing its\r\ndark outer layer of pericarp, and thereby depriving it of a portion of\r\nits pungency. It is mentioned by Dioscorides, yet was evidently very\r\nlittle known in Europe even during the middle ages. In the time of\r\nPlatearius,[2168] white pepper was supposed to be derived from a plant\r\ndifferent from Piper nigrum.\r\n\r\nBuchanan,[2169] referring to Travancore, remarks that white pepper is\r\nmade by allowing the berries to ripen; the bunches are then gathered,\r\nand having been kept for three days in the house, are washed and\r\nbruised in a basket with the hand till all the stalks and pulp are\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThe finest white pepper is obtained from Tellicherry, on the Malabar\r\nCoast, but only in small quantity. The more important places for its\r\npreparation are the Straits Settlements, chiefly Rhio. The export of\r\nwhite pepper from Singapore in 1877 was 48,460 peculs. Most of the\r\nspice finds its way to China, where it is highly esteemed. In Europe,\r\npepper in its natural state is with good reason preferred.\r\n\r\n[2164] _Annual Statement of the Trade of the U.K. for 1872._ 59., 125.\r\n\r\n[2165] According to Moodeen Sheriff (_Suppl. to Pharm. of India_,\r\n134) the berries of _Embelia_ (Samara) _Ribes_, order _Myrsineæ_, are\r\nsaid to be sometimes used for adulterating black pepper in the Indian\r\nbazaars.\r\n\r\n[2166] By the 59 George III. c. 53 § 22 (1819).\r\n\r\n[2167] Consult, Hassall, _Food and its Adulterations_, Lond. 1855. 42;\r\nEvans, _Pharm. Journ._ i.

They are nearly spherical or a\r\nlittle flattened. At the base the skin of the fruit is thickened into\r\na blunt prominence, whence about 12 light stripes run meridian-like\r\ntowards the depressed summit. If the skin is scraped off, the dark\r\nbrown testa is seen enclosing the hard translucent albumen. In\r\nanatomical structure, as well as in taste and smell, white pepper\r\nagrees with black, which in fact it represents in a rather more\r\nfully-grown state.\r\n\r\nWhite pepper appears to afford on an average not more than 1·9 per\r\ncent. of essential oil, but to be richer in piperin, of which Cazeneuve\r\nand Caillol (1877) extracted as much as 9 per cent. The amount of ash\r\nyielded by white pepper is 1·1 per cent. on an average, that is to say,\r\nconsiderably less than by black pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS PIPERIS LONGI.\r\n\r\n_Piper longum_; _Long Pepper_; F. _Poivre long_; G. _Langer Pfeffer_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Piper officinarum_ C. DC. (_Chavica[2170]\r\nofficinarum_ Miq.), a diœcious shrubby plant, with ovate-oblong\r\nacuminate leaves, attenuated at the base, and having pinnate nerves.\r\nIt is a native of the Indian Archipelago, as Java, Sumatra, Celebes\r\nand Timor. Long pepper is the fruit spike, collected and dried shortly\r\nbefore it reaches maturity.\r\n\r\n_Piper longum_ L.[2171] (_Chavica Roxburghii_ Miq.), a shrub indigenous\r\nto Malabar, Ceylon, Eastern Bengal, Timor and the Philippines, also\r\nyields long pepper, for the sake of which it is cultivated along the\r\neastern and western coasts of India. It may be distinguished from the\r\nprevious species by its 5-nerved leaves, cordate at the base.[2172]\r\n\r\n=History=—A drug termed Πέπερι μακρὸν, _Piper longum_, was known to\r\nthe ancient Greeks and Romans, and may have been the same as the _Long\r\nPepper_ of modern times.\r\n\r\nIn the Latin verses bearing the name of Macer Floridus,[2173] which\r\nwere probably written in the 10th century, mention is made of Black,\r\nWhite, and Long Pepper. The last named spice, or _Macropiper_, is\r\nnamed by Simon of Genoa,[2174] who was physician to Pope Nicolas IV.\r\nand chaplain to Boniface VIII. (A.D. 1288-1303), and travelled in the\r\nEast for the study of plants. Piper longum is also met with in the\r\nlist of drugs on which (A.D. 1305) duty was levied at Pisa.[2175]\r\nNicolo Conti of Venice, who lived in India from 1419 to 1444, noticed\r\nLong Pepper.[2176] Saladinus[2177] in the middle of the 15th century\r\nenumerates long pepper among the drugs necessary to be kept by\r\napothecaries and it has had a place in the pharmacopœias to the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[2170] The genus _Chavica_ separated from _Piper_ by Miquel, has been\r\nre-united to it by Casimir de Candolle (_Prod._ xvi. s. 1). The latter\r\ngenus is now composed of not fewer than 620 species!\r\n\r\n[2171] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen’s _Med. Plants_, part 18 (1877).\r\n\r\n[2172] For good figures of the two plants, see Hayne’s\r\n_Arzney-Gewächse_, xiv.

An English acre will yield in the first year\r\nabout three maunds (1 maund = 80 lbs.) of the pepper, in the second\r\ntwelve, and in the third eighteen; after which, as the plant becomes\r\nless and less productive, the roots are grubbed up, dried, and sold\r\nas _Pipli-múl_, of which there is a large consumption in India as a\r\nmedicine. The pepper is gathered in the month of January, when full\r\ngrown, and exposed to the sun until perfectly dry. After the fruit has\r\nbeen collected, the stem and branches die down to the ground.[2178]\r\n\r\n[2178] Roxburgh, _Flora Indica_, i. (1832) 155.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Long pepper consists of a multitude of minute baccate\r\nfruits, closely packed around a common axis, the whole forming a\r\nspike of 1½ inch long and ¼ of an inch thick. The spike is supported\r\non a stalk ½ an inch long; it is rounded above and below, and tapers\r\nslightly towards its upper end. The fruits are ovoid, ⅒ of an inch\r\nlong, crowned with a nipple-like point (the remains of the stigma), and\r\narranged spirally with a small peltate bract beneath each. A transverse\r\nsection of a spike exhibits 8 to 10 separate fruits, disposed radially\r\nwith their narrower end pointed towards the axis. Beneath the pericarp,\r\nthe thin brown testa encloses a colourless albumen, of which the\r\nobtuser end is occupied by the small embryo.\r\n\r\nThe long pepper of the shops is greyish-white, and appears as if it\r\nhad been rolled in some earthy powder. When washed, the spikes acquire\r\ntheir proper colour,—a deep reddish-brown. The drug has a burning\r\naromatic taste, and an agreeable but not powerful odour.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing description applies to the long pepper of English\r\ncommerce, which is now obtained chiefly from Java (see next page),\r\nwhere _P. officinarum_ is the common species. In fact the fruits of\r\nthis latter, as presented to us by Mr. Binnendyk, of the Botanical\r\nGarden, Buitenzorg, near Batavia, offer no characters by which we can\r\ndistinguish them from the article found in the London shops. Those of\r\n_P. Betle_ L. var. γ. _densum_ are extremely similar, but we do not\r\nknow that they are collected for use.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The structure of the individual fruits\r\nresembles that of black pepper, exhibiting however some characteristic\r\ndifferences. The epicarp has on the outside, tangentially-extended,\r\nthick-walled, narrow cells, containing gum; the middle layer consists\r\nof wider, thin-walled, obviously porous parenchyme containing starch\r\nand drops of oil. In the outer and middle layers of the fruit numerous\r\nlarge thick-walled cells are scattered, as in the external pericarp\r\nof _Piper nigrum_; in long pepper, however, they do not form a close\r\ncircle. The inner pericarp is formed of a row of large, cubic or\r\nelongated, radially-arranged cells, filled with volatile oil. A row\r\nof smaller tangentially-extended cells separates these oil-cells\r\nfrom the compact brown-red testa, which consists of lignified cells\r\nlike the inner layer of the testa of black pepper, but without the\r\nthick-walled cells peculiar to the latter. The albumen of long pepper\r\nis distinguished from that of black pepper by the absence of volatile\r\noil.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Constituents=—The constituents of long pepper appear to\r\nbe the same as those of black pepper. We ascertained the presence of\r\npiperin; 8 pounds of the drug were not sufficient to afford us an\r\nappreciable quantity of the volatile oil. The resin and volatile oil\r\nreside exclusively in the pericarp. Long pepper, according to Blyth\r\n(1874), yields 8⅓ per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Long pepper is at present exported from Penang and\r\nSingapore, whither it is brought chiefly from Java, and to a much\r\nsmaller extent from Rhio. The quantity exported from Singapore in\r\n1871 amounted to 3,366 cwt., of which only 447 cwt. were shipped\r\nto the United Kingdom, the remainder being sent chiefly to British\r\nIndia.[2179] The export from Penang is from 2,000 to 3,000 peculs\r\nannually. There is also a considerable export of long pepper from\r\nCalcutta.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Long pepper is scarcely used as a medicine, black pepper having\r\nbeen substituted in the few preparations in which it was formerly\r\nordered, but it is employed as a spice and in veterinary medicine.\r\n\r\nThe aromatic root of _Piper longum_, called in Sanskrit\r\n_Pippali-mula_[2180] (whence the modern name _pipli-múl_), is a\r\nfavourite remedy of the Hindus and also known to the Persians and Arabs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUBEBÆ.\r\n\r\n_Fructus vel Baccæ vel Piper Cubebæ_[2181]; _Cubebs_; F. _Cubèbes_; G.\r\n_Cubeben_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Piper Cubeba_ Linn. f. (_Cubeba officinalis_ Miq.),\r\na climbing, woody, diœcious shrub, indigenous to Java, Southern Borneo\r\nand Sumatra.[2182]\r\n\r\n=History=—Cubebs have been introduced into medicine by the Arabian\r\nphysicians of the middle ages, who describe them as having the form,\r\ncolour, and properties of pepper. Masudi[2183] in the 10th century\r\nstated them to be a production of Java. Edrisi,[2184] the geographer,\r\nin A.D. 1153 enumerated them among the imports of Aden.\r\n\r\nAmong European writers, Constantinus Africanus of Salerno was\r\nacquainted with this drug as early as the 11th century; and in the\r\nbeginning of the 13th its virtues were noticed in the writings of the\r\nAbbess Hildegard in Germany, and even in those of Henrik Harpestreng in\r\nDenmark.[2185]\r\n\r\nCubebs are mentioned as a production of Java (“_grant isle de Javva_”)\r\nby Marco Polo; and by Odoric, an Italian friar, who visited the island\r\nabout forty years later. In the 13th century the drug was an article\r\nof European trade, and would appear to have already been regularly\r\nimported into London.[2186] Duty was levied upon them as _Cubebas\r\nsilvestres_ at Barcelona in 1271.[2187] They are mentioned about this\r\nperiod as sold in the fairs of Champagne in France, the price being 4\r\n_sous_ per lb.[2188] They were also sold in England: in accounts under\r\ndate 1284 they are enumerated with almonds, saffron, raisins, white\r\npepper, grains [of paradise], mace, galangal, and gingerbread, and\r\nentered as costing 2_s._ per lb. In 1285—2_s._ 6_d._ to 3_s._ per lb.;\r\nwhile in 1307, 1 lb. purchased for the King’s Wardrobe cost 9_s._[2189]\r\n\r\n[2179] _Blue Book of the Straits Settlements for 1871._\r\n\r\n[2180] Already in the Rāmāyana.\r\n\r\n[2181] _Cubeba_ from the Arabic _Kabábah_.\r\n\r\n[2182] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen’s _Med.

Among those who could command such luxuries, they were eaten\r\nin powder with meat, or they were candied whole. A patent of pontage\r\ngranted in 1305 by Edward I., to aid in repairing and sustaining the\r\nBridge of London, and authorizing toll on various articles, mentions\r\namong groceries and spices, cubebs as liable to impost.[2190] Cubebs\r\noccur in the German lists of medicines of Frankfort and Nördlingen,\r\nabout 1450 and 1480;[2191] they are also mentioned in the _Confectbuch_\r\nof Hans Folcz of Nuremberg, dating about 1480.[2192]\r\n\r\nIt cannot however be said that cubebs were a common spice, at all\r\ncomparable with pepper or ginger, or even in such frequent use as\r\ngrains of paradise or galangal. Garcia de Orta (1563) speaks of them as\r\nbut seldom used in Europe; yet they are named by Saladinus as necessary\r\nto be kept in every _apotheca_.[2193] In a list of drugs to be sold\r\nin the apothecaries’ shops of the city of Ulm, A.D. 1596, cubebs are\r\nmentioned as _Fructus carpesiorum vel cubebarum_, the price for half\r\nan ounce being quoted as 8 _kreuzers_, the same as that of opium,\r\nbest manna, and amber, while black and white pepper are priced at 2\r\n_kreuzers_.[2194]\r\n\r\nAlthough it was always well known that the cubebs were a product of\r\nJava and that island is stated to have exported in 1775 as much as\r\n10,000 lb. of this spice,[2195] its mother plant was made known only in\r\n1781 by the younger Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe action of cubebs on the urino-genital organs was known to the\r\nold Arabian physicians. Yet modern writers on materia medica even at\r\nthe commencement of the present century, mentioned the drug simply\r\nas an aromatic stimulant resembling pepper, but inferior to that\r\nspice and rarely employed,[2196]—in fact it had so far fallen into\r\ndisuse that it was omitted from the London Pharmacopœia of 1809.\r\nAccording to Crawfurd, its importation into Europe, which had long been\r\ndiscontinued, recommenced in 1815, in consequence of its medicinal\r\nvirtues having been brought to the knowledge of the English medical\r\nofficers serving in Java, by their Hindu servants.[2197]\r\n\r\n[2190] _Liber niger Scaccarii_, Lond. 1771, i. 478.—A translation may\r\nbe found in the _Chronicles of London Bridge_, 1827, 155.\r\n\r\n[2191] _Archiv der Pharmacie_, 201 (1872) 441 and 211 (1877) 101.\r\n\r\n[2192] Choulant, _Macer Floridus_, etc., Lips. 1832, 188.\r\n\r\n[2193] _Compendium aromatariorum_, Bonon., 1488.\r\n\r\n[2194] Richard, _Beiträge zur Geschichte der Apotheken_, 1825. 124.\r\n\r\n[2195] Miquel, _Commentarii phytographici_, i.

In the 6th edition of the\r\nsame work (1811) it was altogether omitted. See also Murray’s _System\r\nof Mat. Med. and Pharm._ i. (1810) 266.\r\n\r\n[2197] _Dictionary of the Indian Islands_, 1856. 117.—Mr. Crawfurd\r\nhimself communicated to the _Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal_ of\r\n1818 (xiv. 32) a paper making known the “wonderful success” with which\r\ncubebs had been used in gonorrhœa.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation and Production=[2198]—Cubebs are cultivated in small\r\nspecial plantations and also in coffee plantations, in the district\r\nof Banjoemas in the south of Java. The fruits are bought by Chinese\r\nwho carry them to Batavia. They are likewise produced in Eastern Java\r\nand about Bantam and Soebang in the north-west; and extensively in the\r\nLampong country in Sumatra. There has of late been a large distribution\r\nof plants among the European coffee planters.\r\n\r\n[2198] We are indebted for some particulars under this head to our\r\nfriends Mr. Binnendyk, of the Buitenzorg Botanical Garden near Batavia,\r\nand Dr. De Vry.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of cubebs is easy. In the coffee estates certain trees\r\nare required for shade: against these _Piper Cubeba_ is planted, and\r\nclimbing to a height of 18 to 20 feet, forms a large bush.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The cubebs of commerce consist of the dry globose fruits,\r\ngathered when full-grown, but before they have arrived at maturity.\r\nThe fruit is about ⅕ of an inch in diameter, when very young sessile,\r\nbut subsequently elevated on a straight thin stalk, a little longer or\r\neven twice as long as itself. By this stalk the fruit is attached in\r\nconsiderable numbers (sometimes more than 50) to a common thickened\r\nstalk or rachis, about 1½ inch long.\r\n\r\nCommercial cubebs are spherical, sometimes depressed at the base,\r\nvery slightly pointed at the apex, strongly wrinkled by the shrinking\r\nof the fleshy pericarp; they are of a greyish-brown or blackish hue,\r\nfrequently covered with an ashy-grey bloom. The stalk is the elongated\r\nbase of the fruit, and remains permanently attached. The common axis\r\nor rachis, which is almost devoid of essential oil, is also frequently\r\nmixed with the drug.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the fruit covers a hard, smooth brown shell containing the\r\nseed, which latter when developed has a compressed spherical form, a\r\nsmooth surface, and adheres to the pericarp only at the base; its apex\r\neither projects slightly or is pressed inwards. The albumen is solid,\r\nwhitish, oily, and encloses a small embryo below the apex. In the\r\ncubebs of the shops, the seed is mostly undeveloped and shrunken, and\r\nthe pericarp nearly empty.\r\n\r\nCubebs have a strong, aromatic, persistent taste, with some bitterness\r\nand acridity. Their smell is highly aromatic and by no means\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—This exhibits some peculiarities. The skin\r\nof the fruit below the epidermis, is made up of small, cubic,\r\nthick-walled cells, forming an interrupted row, and only half as large\r\nas in black pepper. The broad middle layer consists of small cubic\r\nthick-walled cells, forming an interrupted row, and only half as large\r\nas in black pepper. The broad middle layer consists of small-celled\r\nundeveloped tissue containing drops of oil, granules of starch, and\r\ncrystalline groups of cubebin, probably also fat. This middle layer\r\nis interrupted by very large oil-cells, which frequently enclose\r\nneedle-shaped crystals of cubebin, united in concentric groups. The\r\nmuch narrower inner layer consists of about four rows of somewhat\r\nlarger tangentially-extended soft cells, holding essential oil. Next to\r\nthese comes the light yellow brittle shell, formed of a densely packed\r\nrow of encrusted, radially-arranged, elongated thick-walled cells.\r\nLastly, the embryo is covered with a thin brown membrane, and exhibits\r\nthe structure and contents as that of _Piper nigrum_, excepting that in\r\n_P. Cubeba_ the cells are rounder, and the crystals consist of cubebin\r\nand not of piperin.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most obvious constituent of cubebs is the\r\nvolatile oil, the proportion of which yielded by the drug varies from 4\r\nto 13 per cent. The causes of this great variation may be found in the\r\nconstitution of the drug itself, as well as in the alterability of the\r\noil, and the fact that its prevailing constituents begin not to boil\r\nbelow 264° C. It is, as shown in 1875 by Oglialoro, a mixture of an oil\r\nC₁₀H₁₆, boiling at 158°-163°, which is present to a very small amount,\r\nand two oils of the formula C₁₃H₂₄, boiling at 262°-265° C. One of the\r\nlatter deviates the plane of polarization strongly to the left, and\r\nyields the crystallized compound C₁₅H₂₄ 2 HCl, melting at 118° C. The\r\nother hydrocarbon is less lævogyrate and cannot be combined with HCl.\r\n\r\nOne part of oil of cubebs, diluted with about 20 parts of bisulphide of\r\ncarbon, assumes at first a greenish, and afterwards a blue coloration,\r\nif one drop of a mixture of concentrated sulphuric and nitric acids\r\n(equal weight of each acid) is shaken with the solution.\r\n\r\nThe oil distilled from old cubebs on cooling at length deposits large,\r\ntransparent, inodorous octohedra of _camphor of cubebs_, C₃₀H₄₈ + 2\r\nOH₂, belonging to the rhombic system. They melt at 65° and may be\r\nsublimed at 148°. We have not succeeded in obtaining them by keeping\r\nthe oil of fresh cubebs for two years in contact with water, to which a\r\nlittle alcohol and nitric acid was added.\r\n\r\nAnother constituent of cubebs is _Cubebin_, crystals of which may\r\nsometimes be seen in the pericarp even with a common lens. It was\r\ndiscovered by Soubeiran and Capitaine in 1839; it is an inodorous\r\nsubstance, crystallizing in small needles or scales, melting at 125°,\r\nhaving a bitter taste in alcoholic solution; it dissolves freely in\r\nboiling alcohol, but is mostly deposited upon cooling; it requires 30\r\nparts of cold ether for solution, and is also abundantly soluble in\r\nchloroform. We found this solution to be slightly lævogyre; it turns\r\nred on addition of concentrated sulphuric acid. If the solution of\r\ncubebin in chloroform is shaken with dry pentoxide of phosphorus, it\r\nturns _blue_ and gradually becomes red by the influence of moisture.\r\nCubebin is nearly insoluble in cold, but slightly soluble in hot water.\r\nBernatzik (1866) obtained from cubebs 0·40 per cent. of cubebin,\r\nSchmidt (1870) 2·5 per cent. The crystals, which are deposited in an\r\nalcoholic or ethereal extract of cubebs, consist of cubebin in an\r\nimpure state. Cubebin is devoid of any remarkable therapeutic action.\r\nIts composition, according to Weidel (1877) answers to the formula\r\nC₁₀H₁₀O₃; by melting it with caustic potash, cubebin is resolved as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n    C₁₀H₁₀O₃ · 5 O = CO₂ ·  C₂H₄O₂   ·  C₆H₃(OH)₂COOH.\r\n                           Acetic      Protocatechuic\r\n                            Acid.           Acid.\r\n\r\nThe resin extracted from cubebs consists of an indifferent portion,\r\nnearly 3 per cent., and of _Cubebic Acid_, amounting to about 1 per\r\ncent. of the drug. Both are amorphous, and so, according to Schmidt,\r\nare the salts of cubebic acid. Bernatzik however, found some of them,\r\nas that of barium, to be crystallizable. Schulze (1873) prepared\r\ncubebic acid from the crystallized sodium-salt, but was unable to get\r\nit other than amorphous. The resins, the indifferent as well as the\r\nacid, possess the therapeutic properties of the drug.\r\n\r\nSchmidt further pointed out the presence in cubebs, of gum (8 per\r\ncent.), fatty oil, and malates of magnesium and calcium.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Cubebs were imported into Singapore in 1872 to the extent of\r\n3062 cwt., of which amount 2348 cwt. were entered as from Netherlands\r\nIndia. The drug was re-shipped during the same year to the amount of\r\n2766 cwt., the quantity exported to the United Kingdom being 1180 cwt.,\r\nto the United States of America 1244 cwt., and to British India 104\r\ncwt.[2199] In the previous year, a larger quantity was shipped to India\r\nthan to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Cubebs are much employed in the treatment of gonorrhœa. The\r\ndrug is usually administered in powder; less frequently in the form of\r\nethereal or alcoholic extract, or essential oil.\r\n\r\nBernatzik and Schmidt, whose chemical and therapeutical experiments\r\nhave thrown much light on the subject, have shown that the efficacy\r\nof cubebs being dependent on the indifferent resin and cubebic acid,\r\npreparations which contain the utmost amount of these bodies and\r\nexclude other constituents of the drug, are to be preferred. They would\r\nreject the essential oil, as they find its administration devoid of\r\ntherapeutic effects.\r\n\r\nThe preparations which consequently are to be recommended, are the\r\nberries deprived of their essential oil and constituents soluble in\r\nwater, and then dried and powdered; an alcoholic extract prepared from\r\nthe same, or the purified resins.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Cubebs are not much subject to adulteration, though it\r\nis by no means rare that the imported drug contains an undue proportion\r\nof the inert stalks (rachis)[2200] that require to be picked out before\r\nthe berries are ground. Dealers judge of cubebs by the oiliness and\r\nstrong characteristic smell of the berries when crushed. Those which\r\nhave a large proportion of the pale, smooth, ripe berries, which look\r\n_dry_ when broken, are to be avoided.\r\n\r\nWe have occasionally found in the commercial drug a small, smooth\r\ntwo-celled fruit, of the size, shape, and colour of cubebs, but wanting\r\nthe long pedicel. A slight examination suffices to recognize it as not\r\nbeing cubebs. We have also met with some cubebs of larger size than the\r\nordinary sort, much shrivelled, with a stouter and flattened pedicel,\r\none and a half times to twice as long as the berry. The drug has an\r\nagreeable odour different from that of common cubebs, and a very bitter\r\ntaste. From a comparison with herbarium specimens, we judge that it may\r\npossibly be derived from _Piper crassipes_ Korthals (_Cubeba crassipes_\r\nMiq.), a Sumatran species.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of _Piper Lowong_ Bl. (_Cubeba Lowong_ Miq.), a native of\r\nJava, and those of _P. ribesioides_ Wall. (_Cubeba Wallichii_ Miq.) are\r\nextremely cubeb-like.[2201] Those of _Piper caninum_ A. Dietr. (_Cubeba\r\ncanina_ Miq.), a plant of wide distribution throughout the Malay\r\nArchipelago as far as Borneo, for a specimen of which we have to thank\r\nMr. Binnendyk of Buitenzorg, are smaller than true cubebs, and have\r\nstalks only half the diameter of the berry.\r\n\r\n[2199] _Straits Settlements Blue Book for 1872._ 294. 338.—There are\r\nno statistics for showing the _total import_ of cubebs into the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\n[2200] They yielded to Schmidt 1·7 per cent. of oil and 3 per cent. of\r\nresin.\r\n\r\n[2201] Figured in Nees von Esenbeck, _Plantæ medicinales_, Düsseldorf,\r\ni. (1828), tab. 22. A different figure is given by Miquel, _Comment.\r\nphytogr._ (1839), tab. 3.\r\n\r\nIn the south of China the fruits of _Laurus Cubeba_ Lour. have been\r\nfrequently mistaken by Europeans for cubebs. The tree which affords\r\nthem is unknown to modern botanists; Meissner refers it doubtfully to\r\nthe genus _Tetranthera_.[2202]\r\n\r\nAshantee Pepper, African Cubebs, or West African Black Pepper.\r\n\r\nThis spice is the fruit of _Piper Clusii_ Cas. DC. (_Cubeba Clusii_\r\nMiq.), a species of wide distribution in tropical Africa, most\r\nabundantly occurring in the country of the Niamniam, about 4° to 5°\r\nN. lat., and 28° to 29° E. long. Its splendid red fruit bunches are\r\nspoken of with admiration by Schweinfurth,[2203] who states that\r\n_Piper Clusii_ is one of the characteristic and most conspicuous\r\nplants of those regions. The dried fruit is a round berry having a\r\ngeneral resemblance to common cubebs but somewhat smaller, less rugose,\r\nattenuated into a slender pedicel once or twice as long as the berry\r\nand usually curved. The berries are crowded around a common stalk or\r\nrachis; they are of an ashy-grey tint, and have a hot taste and the\r\nodour of pepper. According to Stenhouse, they contain piperin and not\r\ncubebin.[2204]\r\n\r\nThe fruit of _Piper Clusii_ was known as early as 1364 to the\r\nmerchants of Rouen and Dieppe, who imported it from the Grain Coast,\r\nnow Liberia,[2205] under the name of pepper. The Portuguese likewise\r\nexported it from Benin as far back as 1485, as _Pimienta de rabo_, i.e.\r\n_tailed pepper_, and attempted in vain to sell it in Flanders.[2206]\r\nClusius received from London a specimen of this drug, of which he has\r\nleft a good figure in his _Exotica_.[2207] He says that its importation\r\nwas forbidden by the King of Portugal for fear it should depreciate the\r\npepper of India. The spice was also known to Gerarde and Parkinson;\r\nin our times it has been afresh brought to notice by the late Dr.\r\nDaniell.[2208] In tropical Western Africa it is used as a condiment,\r\nand might easily be collected in large quantities, provided it should\r\nprove a good substitute for pepper.[2209]\r\n\r\n[2202] De Candolle, _Prod._ xv. sect. i. 199; Hanbury in _Pharm.\r\nJourn._ iii.

DC.), occurs in the\r\nBrazilian provinces of Bahia, Minas Geraes and Ceará, as well as in\r\nPeru and the northern parts of South America.\r\n\r\n[2210] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen’s _Med. Plants_, part 18 (1877).\r\n\r\n=History=—The styptic properties of this plant are said to have been\r\ndiscovered by a Spanish soldier named Matico,[2211] who having applied\r\nsome of the leaves to his wounds, observed that the bleeding was\r\nthereby arrested; hence the plant came to be called _Yerba_ or _Palo\r\ndel Soldado_ (soldier’s herb or tree). The story is not very probable,\r\nbut it is current in many parts of South America, and its allusion is\r\nnot confined to the plant under notice.\r\n\r\nThe hæmostatic powers of matico, which are not noticed in the works\r\nof Ruiz and Pavon, were first recognized in Europe by Jeffreys,[2212]\r\na physician of Liverpool, in 1839, but they had already attracted\r\nattention in North America as early as 1827.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Matico, as it arrives in commerce, consists of a\r\ncompressed, coherent, brittle mass of leaves and stems, of a light\r\ngreen hue and pleasant herby odour. More closely examined, it is seen\r\nto be made up of jointed stems bearing lanceolate, acuminate leaves,\r\ncordate and unequal at the base, and having very short stalks. The\r\nleaves are rather thick, with their whole upper surface traversed by\r\na system of minute sunk veins, which divide it into squares and give\r\nit a tessellated appearance. On the under side, these squares form\r\na corresponding series of depressions which are clothed with shaggy\r\nhairs. The leaves attain a length of about 6 inches by 1½ inches broad.\r\nThe flower and fruit spikes which are often 4 to 5 inches long, are\r\nslender and cylindrical with the flowers or fruits densely packed. The\r\nleaves of matico have a bitterish aromatic taste; their tissue shows\r\nnumerous cells, filled with essential oil.[2213]\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The leaves yield on an average 27 per\r\ncent.[2214] of essential oil, which we find slightly[2215] dextrogyre;\r\na large proportion of it distills at 180° to 200° C., the remainder\r\nbecoming thickish. Both portions are lighter than water; but another\r\nspecimen of the oil of matico which we had kept for some years, sinks\r\nin water. We have observed that in winter the oil deposits remarkable\r\ncrystals of a camphor, more than half an inch in length, fusible at\r\n103° C.; they belong to the hexagonal system, and have the odour and\r\ntaste of the oil from which they separate.\r\n\r\nMatico further affords, according to Marcotte (1864),[2216] a\r\ncrystallizable acid, named _Artanthic Acid_, besides some tannin. The\r\nlatter is made evident by the dark brown colour which the infusion\r\nassumes on addition of ferric chloride. The leaves likewise contain\r\nresin, but as shown by Stell in 1858, neither piperin, cubebin, nor any\r\nanalogous principle such as the so-called _Maticin_ formerly supposed\r\nto exist in them.\r\n\r\n[2211] Matico is the diminutive of _Mateo_, the Spanish for _Matthew_.\r\n\r\n[2212] _Remarks on the efficacy of Matico as a styptic and astringent_,\r\n3rd ed., Lond. 1845.\r\n\r\n[2213] Microscopic examination of the leaves, Pocklington, _Pharm.\r\nJourn._ v.

(1869) 278.—We\r\nare not acquainted with “artanthic acid.”\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The drug is imported in bales and serons by way of Panama.\r\nAmong the exports of the Peruvian port of Arica in 1877, we noticed 195\r\nquintales (19,773 lb) of Matico.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Matico leaves, previously softened in water, or in a state of\r\npowder, are sometimes employed to arrest the bleeding of a wound. The\r\ninfusion is taken for the cure of internal hæmorrhage.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—Several plants have at times been brought into the market\r\nunder the name of _matico_. One of these is _Piper aduncum_ L.[2217]\r\n(_Artanthe adunca_ Miq.), of which a quantity was imported into London\r\nfrom Central America in 1863, and first recognized by Bentley (1864).\r\nIn colour, odour, and shape of leaf it nearly agrees with ordinary\r\nmatico; but differs in that the leaves are marked beneath by much more\r\nprominent ascending parallel nerves, the spaces between which are\r\nnot rugose but comparatively smooth and nearly glabrous. In chemical\r\ncharacters, the leaves of _P. aduncum_ appear to accord with those of\r\n_P. angustifolium_.\r\n\r\n_Piper aduncum_ is a plant of wide distribution throughout Tropical\r\nAmerica. Under the name of _Nhandi_ or _Piper longum_ it was mentioned\r\nby Piso in 1648[2218] on account of the stimulant action of its leaves\r\nand roots,—a property which causes it to be still used in Brazil, where\r\nhowever no particular styptic virtues seem to be ascribed to it.[2219]\r\nThe fruits are there employed in the place of cubebs. Sloane’s\r\nfigure[2220] of “Piper longum, arbor folio latissimo” also shows _Piper\r\naduncum_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Triana, _Piper lanceæfolium_ HBK. (_Artanthe_ Miq.), and\r\nanother species not recognized, yield matico in New Granada.[2221]\r\n_Waltheria glomerata_ Presl (_Sterculiaceæ_) is called _Palo del\r\nSoldado_ at Panama and its leaves are used as a vulnerary.[2222] In\r\nRiobamba and Quito, _Eupatorium glutinosum_ Lamarck, is also called\r\nChusalonga or _Matico_.[2223]\r\n\r\n[2217] For a good figure, see Jacquin, _Icones_ II.

It grows in shady woods in the United States, from Missouri and\r\nIndiana to Florida and Virginia,—abundantly in the Alleghanies and in\r\nthe Cumberland Mountains, less frequently in New York, Michigan and the\r\nother Northern States. The plant varies exceedingly in the shape of its\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n=History=—The botanists of the 16th century, being fond of\r\nappellations alluding to the animal kingdom, gave the names of\r\n_Serpentaria_ or Colubrina, _i.e._ snake-root, to the rhizome of\r\n_Polygonum Bistorta_ L. In America it was not the appearance, but\r\nthe application of the drug under notice to which it owes the name\r\nsnake-root.\r\n\r\nThe earliest account of _Virginian_ snake-root is that of Thomas\r\nJohnson, an apothecary of London who published an edition of Gerarde’s\r\nHerbal in 1636. It is evident however that Johnson confounded a species\r\nof _Aristolochia_ from Crete with what he calls “that snake-weed that\r\nwas brought from Virginia and grew with Mr. John Tradescant at South\r\nLambeth, anno 1632.” It was very briefly noticed by Cornuti in his\r\n_Canadensium Plantarum Historia_ (1635), and in a much more intelligent\r\nmanner by Parkinson in 1640. These authors, as well as Dale (1693) and\r\nGeoffroy (1741), extol the virtues of the root as a remedy for the bite\r\nof the rattlesnake, or of a rabid dog. Serpentary was introduced into\r\nthe London Pharmacopœia in 1650.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The snake-root of commerce includes the rhizome, which\r\nis knotty, contorted, scarcely 1 inch in length by ⅛ of an inch in\r\nthickness, bearing on its upper side the short bases of the stems of\r\nprevious years, and throwing off from the under, numerous, slender,\r\nmatted, branching roots, 2 to 4 inches long. The rhizome is often still\r\nattached to portions of the weak, herbaceous stem, which sometimes\r\nbears the fruit,—more rarely flowers and leaves. The drug has a dull\r\nbrown hue, an aromatic odour resembling valerian but less unpleasant,\r\nand a bitterish aromatic taste, calling to mind camphor, valerian and\r\nturpentine.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—In the rhizome, the outer layer of the bark\r\nconsists of a single row of cuboid cells; the middle cortical portion\r\n(_mesophlœum_) of about six layers of larger cells. In the liber, which\r\nis built up of numerous layers of smaller cells, those belonging to\r\nthe medullary rays are nearly cuboid with distinctly porous walls,\r\nthose of the liber bundles being smaller and arranged in a somewhat\r\ncrescent-shaped manner. Groups of short, reticulated or punctuated\r\nvessels alternate in the woody rays with long, porous, ligneous cells;\r\nthose close to the pith having thick walls. The largest cells of all\r\nare those composing the pith; the latter, seen in transverse section,\r\noccupies not the very centre of the rootstock, but is found nearer to\r\nits upper side. The rootlets exhibit a central fibro-vascular bundle,\r\nsurrounded by a nucleus-sheath. In the mesophlœum both of the rootstock\r\nand the rootlets, there occur a few cells containing a yellow essential\r\noil. The other cells are loaded with starch.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Essential oil exists in the drug to the extent\r\nof about ½ per cent.; and resin in nearly the same proportion. The\r\nouter cortical layer, as well as the zone of the nucleus-sheath,\r\ncontains a little tannin, and a watery infusion of the drug is coloured\r\ngreenish by perchloride of iron. Neutral acetate of lead precipitates\r\nsome mucilage as well as the bitter principle, which latter may also be\r\nobtained by means of tannic acid. It is an amorphous, bitter substance,\r\nwhich deserves further investigation. By an alkaline solution of\r\ntartrate of copper the presence in serpentary of sugar is made evident.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Virginian snake-root is imported from New York and Boston,\r\nin bales, casks or bags.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The drug is employed in the form of an infusion or tincture as\r\na stimulating tonic and diaphoretic; it is more often prescribed in\r\ncombination with cinchona bark than by itself. Its ancient reputation\r\nfor the cure of snake-bites is now disregarded.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration and Substitution=—Virginian snake-root is said to be\r\nsometimes adulterated with the root of _Spigelia marilandica_ L.,\r\nwhich has neither its smell nor taste (see p. 433); or with that of\r\n_Cypripedium pubescens_ L., which it scarcely at all resembles. It is\r\nnot uncommon to find here and there in the serpentary of commerce, a\r\nroot of _Panax quinquefolium_ L. accidentally collected, but never\r\nadded for the purpose of adulteration.\r\n\r\nThe root of _Aristolochia reticulata_ Nutt., a plant of Louisiana and\r\nArkansas, has been brought into commerce in considerable quantity\r\nas _Texan_ or _Red River Snake-root_.[2224] We are indebted for an\r\nauthentic specimen from the Cherokee country to Mr. Merrell, a large\r\ndealer in herbs at St. Louis, Missouri, who states that all the\r\nserpentary grown south-west of the Rocky Mountains is the produce of\r\nthat species. The late Prof. Parrish of Philadelphia was kind enough\r\nto supply us with specimens of the same drug, as well as with reliable\r\nsamples of true _Virginian_ or _Middle States Snake-root_.\r\n\r\nThe Texan snake-root is somewhat thicker and less matted than that\r\nderived from _A. Serpentaria_, but has the odour and taste of the\r\nlatter; some say it is less aromatic. The plant, portions of which\r\nare often present, may be easily distinguished by its leaves being\r\n_coriaceous_, _sessile_ and _strongly reticulated_ on their under\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n[2224] Wiegand in _American Journ. of Pharm._ x.

The first is the common oak of the greater\r\npart of England and the lowlands of Scotland. The second is frequently\r\nscattered in woods in which the first variety prevails, but it rarely\r\nconstitutes the mass of the oak woods in the south of England. In North\r\nWales however, in the hilly parts of the north of England, and in\r\nScotland, it is the commoner of the two forms (Bentham).\r\n\r\n[2225] _Prodromus_, xvi. (1864) sect. 2. fasc. 1.\r\n\r\n=History=—The astringent properties of all parts of the oak[2226] were\r\nwell known to Dioscorides, who recommends a decoction of the inner\r\nbark in colic, dysentery and spitting of blood. Yet oak bark seems at\r\nno time to have been held in great esteem as a medicine, probably on\r\naccount of its commonness; and it is now almost superseded by other\r\nastringents. For tanning leather it has always been largely employed.\r\n\r\n[2226] Probably not _Q. Robur_ L.\r\n\r\n=Description=—For medicinal use the bark of the younger stems or\r\nbranches is collected in the early spring. It varies somewhat in\r\nappearance according to the age of the wood from which it has been\r\ntaken: that usually supplied to English druggists is in channelled\r\npieces of variable length and a tenth of an inch or less in thickness,\r\nsmooth, of a shining silvery grey, variegated with brown, dotted\r\nover with little scars. The inner surface is light rusty-brown,\r\nlongitudinally striated. The fracture is tough and fibrous. A\r\ntransverse section shows a thin, greenish cork-layer, within which\r\nis the brown parenchyme, marked with numerous rows of translucent\r\ncolourless spots. The smell of dry oak bark is very faint; but when\r\nthe bark is moistened the odour of tan becomes evident. The taste is\r\nastringent and in old barks slightly bitter.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The outer layer of young oak bark consists of\r\nsmall flat cork-cells; the middle layer of larger thick-walled cells\r\nslightly extended in a tangential direction, and containing brown\r\ngrains and chlorophyll. This tissue passes gradually into the softer\r\nnarrower parenchyme of the inner bark, which is irregularly traversed\r\nby narrow medullary rays. It exhibits moreover a ring, but slightly\r\ninterrupted, of thick-walled cells (sclerenchyme) and isolated shining\r\nbundles of liber-fibres.\r\n\r\nGroups of crystals of calcium oxalate are frequent in the middle and\r\ninner bark, but the chief constituents of the cells are brown granules\r\nof colouring matter and tannin. As the thickness of the bark increases\r\nthe liber is pushed more to the outside, the middle cortical layer\r\nbeing partly thrown off by secondary cork-formation (rhytidoma, see pp.\r\n354 and 538). Hence the younger barks, which alone are medicinal, are\r\nwidely different from the older in structure and appearance.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most interesting constituent is a peculiar\r\nkind of tannin. Stenhouse pointed out in 1843 that the tannic acid of\r\noak bark is not identical with that of nutgalls; and such many years\r\nafterwards was proved to be the case.\r\n\r\nThe first-named substance, now called _Querci-tannic Acid_, yields\r\nby destructive distillation pyrocatechin, and according to Johanson\r\n(1875) very little pyrogallol. By boiling it with dilute sulphuric\r\nacid querci-tannic acid is split up into a red derivative and sugar.\r\nA solution of gelatine is precipitated by querci-tannic acid as well\r\nas by gallo-tannic acid; yet the compound formed with the latter is\r\nvery liable to putrefaction, whereas the tannin of oak bark, which is\r\naccompanied by a large amount of extractive matter, furnishes a stable\r\ncompound, and is capable of forming good leather.\r\n\r\nAs querci-tannic acid has not yet been isolated in a pure state, the\r\nexact estimation of the strength of the tanning principle in oak\r\nbark has not been accomplished, although it is important from an\r\neconomic as well as from a scientific point of view. The method of\r\nNeubauer (1873) depends upon the amount of permanganate of potassium\r\ndecomposable by the extract of a given weight of oak bark. Neubauer\r\nfound in the bark of young stems, as grown for tanning purposes, from 7\r\nto 10 per cent. of querci-tannic acid, soluble in cold water.\r\n\r\nBraconnot (1849) extracted from the seeds of the oaks under notice\r\na crystallized sugar, which was shown in 1851 by Dessaignes to be\r\na peculiar substance, which he termed _Quercite_. Prunier proved\r\n(1877-1878) that it agrees with the formula C₆H₇(OH)₅ + 4 OH₂, and is\r\nclosely allied to kinic acid, C₆H₇(OH)₄COOH (see page 363). Quercite\r\ngives off water at 100°, melts at 225° C., and again losing water\r\nyields a crystallized anhydride. In the oak bark extremely small\r\nquantities of quercite appear also to be present, as pointed out by\r\nJohanson.\r\n\r\nA colourless, crystallizable, bitter substance, soluble in water, but\r\nnot in absolute alcohol or ether, was extracted from oak bark in 1843\r\nby Gerber, and named _Quercin_. It requires further examination: Eckert\r\n(1864) could not detect its existence in young oak bark.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Occasionally employed as an astringent, chiefly for external\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALLÆ HALEPENSES.\r\n\r\n    _Gallæ Turcicæ_; _Galls_, _Nutgalls_,\r\n       _Oak Galls_, _Aleppo_ or _Turkey Galls_;\r\n        F. _Noix de Galle_, _Galle d’Alep_;\r\n        G. _Levantische oder Aleppische Gallen_,\r\n        _Galläpfel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Quercus lusitanica_ Webb, var. _infectoria_ (_Q.\r\ninfectoria_ Oliv.),[2227] a shrub or rarely a tree, found in Greece,\r\nAsia Minor, Cyprus and Syria. It is probable that other varieties of\r\nthis oak, as well as allied species, contribute to furnish the Aleppo\r\ngalls of commerce.\r\n\r\n=History=—Oak galls are named by Theophrastus, and were well known to\r\nother ancient writers. Alexander Trallianus prescribed them as a remedy\r\nin diarrhœa.[2228]\r\n\r\nThe earliest accurate descriptions and figures of the oak and the\r\ninsect producing the galls are due to Olivier.[2229] Pliny[2230]\r\nmentions the interesting fact that paper saturated with an infusion\r\nof galls may be used as a test for discovering sulphate of iron, when\r\nadded as an adulteration to the more costly verdigris: this, according\r\nto Kopp, is the earliest instance of the scientific application of a\r\nchemical reaction.[2231] For tanning and dyeing, galls have been used\r\nfrom the earliest times, during the middle ages however they were not\r\nprecisely an article of great importance, being then, no doubt, for a\r\nlarge part replaced by sumach.\r\n\r\nNutgalls have long been an object of commerce between Western Asia and\r\nChina. Barbosa in his _Description of the East Indies_[2232] written\r\nin 1514 calls them _Magican_,[2233] and says they are brought from the\r\nLevant to Cambay by way of Mekka, and that they are worth a great deal\r\nin China and Java. From the statements of Porter Smith[2234] we learn\r\nthat they are still prized by the Chinese.\r\n\r\n[2227] De Candolle, _Prodromus_, xvi. sect. 2. fasc. i. 17.\r\n\r\n[2228] Puschmann’s edition, quoted in the Appendix, i. 237.\r\n\r\n[2229] _Voyage dans l’Empire Othoman_, ii.

Med. and Nat. Hist. of China_, 1871. 100.\r\n\r\n=Formation=—Many plants are punctured by insects for the sake of\r\ndepositing their eggs, which operation gives rise to those excrescences\r\nwhich bear the general name of _gall_.[2235]\r\n\r\nOaks are specially liable to be visited for this purpose by insects\r\nof the order _Hymenoptera_ and the genus _Cynips_, one species of\r\nwhich, _Cynips Gallæ tinctoriæ_ Olivier (_Diplolepis Gallæ tinctoriæ_\r\nLatreille), occasions the galls under notice.\r\n\r\nThe female of this little creature is furnished with a delicate borer\r\nor ovipositor, which she is able to protrude from the extremity of the\r\nabdomen; by means of it she pierces the tender shoot of the oak, and\r\ndeposits therein one or more eggs. This minute operation occasions an\r\nabnormal affluence to the spot of the juices of the plant, the result\r\nof which is the growth of an excrescence often of great magnitude, in\r\nthe centre of which (but not as it appears until the gall has become\r\nfull-grown) the larva is hatched and undergoes its transformations.\r\n\r\nWhen the larva has assumed its final development and become a winged\r\ninsect, which requires a period of five to six months, the latter\r\nbores itself a cylindrical passage from the centre of the gall to its\r\nsurface, and escapes.\r\n\r\nIn the best kind of gall found in commerce, this stage has not yet\r\narrived, the gall having been gathered while the insect is still in\r\nthe larval state. In splitting a number of galls, it is not difficult\r\nto find specimens in all stages, from those containing the scarcely\r\ndistinguishable remains of the minute larva, to those which show the\r\nperfect insect to have perished when in the very act of escaping from\r\nits prison.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Aleppo galls[2236] are spherical, and have a diameter of\r\n⁴/₁₀ to ⁸/₁₀ of an inch. They have a smooth and rather shining surface,\r\nmarked in the upper half of the gall by small pointed knobs and ridges,\r\narranged very irregularly and wide apart; the lower half is more\r\nfrequently smooth. The aperture by which the insect escapes is always\r\nnear the middle. When not perforated, the galls are of a dark olive\r\ngreen, and comparatively heavy; but after the fly has bored its way\r\nout, they become of a yellowish-brown hue, and lighter in weight. Hence\r\nthe distinction in commerce of _Blue_ or _Green Galls_, and _White\r\nGalls_.\r\n\r\n[2235] French writers, as Moquin-Tandon, distinguish the thick-walled\r\ngalls of _Cynips_ from the thin, capsular galls formed by _Aphis_,\r\nterming the former _galles_ and the latter _coques_ (shells).\r\n\r\n[2236] There are many other varieties of oak gall, for descriptions\r\nof some of which, see Guibourt, _Hist. des Drogues_, ii. (1869)\r\n292; and for information on the various gall-insects of the family\r\n_Cynipsidæ_ and the excrescences they produce, consult a paper by Abl\r\nin Wittstein’s _Vierteljahresschrift für prakt_. _Pharm._ vi. (1857)\r\n343-361.\r\n\r\nAleppo galls are hard and brittle, splitting under the hammer;\r\nthey have an acidulous, very astringent taste followed by a slight\r\nsweetness, but have no marked odour. Their fractured surface is\r\nsometimes close-grained, with a waxy or resinous lustre; sometimes\r\n(especially towards the kernel-like centre) loosely granular, or\r\nsometimes again it exhibits a crystalline-looking radiated structure or\r\nis full of clefts. The colour of the interior varies from pale brown\r\nto a deep greenish yellow. The central cavity, sometimes nearly ¼ of\r\nan inch in diameter, which served as a dwelling for the insect, is\r\nlined with a thin hard shell. If the insect has perished while still\r\nvery young, the central cavity and the aperture contain a mass of loose\r\nstarchy cellular tissue, or its pulverulent remains: if the insect has\r\nnot been developed at all, the centre of the gall is entirely composed\r\nof this tissue.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The cellular tissue of the gall is formed in\r\nthe middle layer of large spherical cells with rather thick porous\r\nwalls, becoming considerably smaller towards the circumference. The\r\noutermost rows are built up of cells having but a very small lumen\r\nand comparatively thick walls, so that they form a sort of rind. Here\r\nand there throughout the entire tissue, there occur isolated bundles\r\nof vessels which pass through the stalk into the gall. Towards the\r\nkernel, the parenchyme gradually passes into radially-extended,\r\nwider, thin-walled cells, the walls of which are marked with spiral\r\nstriæ. The hard shell of the chamber[2237] is composed of larger,\r\nradially-extended, thick-walled cells, with beautifully stratified\r\nporous walls. On the inner side of this shell there are found, after\r\nthe escape of the insect, the remains of the starchy tissue already\r\nmentioned, which originally filled the chamber and had been consumed by\r\nthe insect as nourishment.\r\n\r\n[2237] _Couche protectrice_ of Lacaze-Duthiers—_Recherches pour servir\r\nà l’histoire des galles_.—_Ann. des Sciences Nat._, Bot. xix. (1853)\r\n273-354.\r\n\r\nThe parenchyme-cells outside the shell contain chlorophyll and tannin;\r\nthe latter is in transparent, colourless, sharp-edged masses, insoluble\r\nin benzol, but dissolving slowly in water, quickly in alcohol. Thin\r\nslices soaked in glycerin appear after some time covered with beautiful\r\ncrystals of gallic acid. The thick-walled cells (stone-cells) and the\r\nneighbouring striated cells, are rich in octahedra of calcium oxalate.\r\nThe tissue of the gall situated within the shell of thick-walled cells\r\ncontains starch in large, compressed, mostly spherical granules; also\r\nisolated masses of brown resin. Besides these, there appears to be in\r\nthis part of the tissue an albuminoid compound.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The rough taste of galls is due to their chief\r\nconstituent, _Tannic_ or _Gallo-tannic Acid_, C₁₄H₁₀O₉, or\r\n\r\n    C₆H₂(OH)₂COOH}\r\n                 }O\r\n      C₆H₂(OH)₂CO}\r\n\r\nthe type of a numerous family of substances to which vegetables owe\r\ntheir astringent properties. Tannic matter was long supposed to be\r\nof one kind, namely that found in the oak gall, but the researches\r\nof later years have proved the tannin of different plants to possess\r\ndistinctive characters: hence the term _gallo-tannic_ acid to\r\ndistinguish that of galls, from which it is principally derived. It\r\nwas however shown by Stenhouse as far back as the year 1843, again in\r\n1861, as well as by still more recent unpublished experiments, that the\r\ntannic acid found in Sicilian sumach, the leaves of _Rhus Coriaria_\r\nL., is identical with that of oak galls. Löwe in 1873 came to the same\r\nconclusion. The best oak galls yield of this acid, from 60 to 70 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n_Gallic Acid_ is also contained in galls ready-formed to the extent of\r\nabout 3 per cent. Free sugar, resin, protein-substances, have also been\r\nfound. Neither gum nor dextrin is present.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The introduction into dyeing of new chemical substances,\r\nand the increased employment of sumach and myrobalans, have caused the\r\ntrade in nutgalls to decline considerably during the last few years.\r\nThe province of Aleppo which used to export annually 10,000 to 12,000\r\nquintals, exported in 1871 only 3000 quintals.[2238] A staple market\r\nfor the galls which are collected in the mountains of Kurdistan is\r\nDiarbekir, whence they are sent to Trebizond for shipment. Galls are\r\nalso shipped in some quantity at Bussorah, Bagdad, Bushire, and Smyrna.\r\n\r\nThere were imported into the United Kingdom from ports of Turkey and\r\nPersia during 1872, 6349 cwt. of galls, valued at £18,581.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Oak galls in their crude state are seldom used in medicine\r\nunless it be externally; but the tannic and gallic acids extracted from\r\nthem are often administered.\r\n\r\nOther kinds of Gall.\r\n\r\n_Chinese or Japanese Galls_—The only kind of galls, besides those of\r\nthe oak, which are of commercial importance. They are described at page\r\n167.\r\n\r\n_Pistacia Galls_—The genus _Pistacia_, which belongs to the same order\r\nas _Rhus_, is very liable to the attacks of _Aphis_, which produce\r\nupon its leaves and branches excrescences of exactly the same nature\r\nas Chinese galls. In the south of Europe, horn-like follicles, often\r\nseveral inches long,[2239] are frequently met with on the branches\r\nof _Pistacia Terebinthus_ (page 165). These _Gallæ vel Folliculi\r\nPistacinæ_, in Italian _Carobbe di Giudea_, were formerly used in\r\nmedicine and in dyeing.[2240] They were noticed in 1555 by Belon, but\r\nalready well known as early as the time of Theophrastus.\r\n\r\nAnother much smaller gall of different shape is formed (by the same\r\ninsect?) on the ribs of the leaves of _Pistacia Terebinthus_; _P.\r\nLentiscus_ (page 161) affords also a similar small excrescence.\r\n\r\nAgain, another growth of the same character constitutes the small\r\nand very astringent galls known in the Indian bazaars by the names\r\nof _Bazghanj_ and _Gule-pistah_, the latter signifying _flower of\r\npistachio_; they have been termed in Europe _Bokhara Galls_. They were\r\nimported by sea into Bombay in the year 1872-73, to the extent of 184\r\ncwt., chiefly from Sind;[2241] and are also carried into North-western\r\nIndia by way of Peshawar and by the Bolan Pass. Occasionally a package\r\nfinds its way into a London drug sale.\r\n\r\n_Tamarisk Galls_—These are roundish knotty excrescences of the size\r\nof a pea up to ½ an inch in diameter, found in North-western India on\r\nthe branches of _Tamarix orientalis_ L., a large, quick-growing tree,\r\ncommon on saline soils. The galls are used in India in the place of\r\noak galls, and are mentioned as “non-officinal” in the _Pharmacopœia\r\nof India_, 1867. We are not aware that they have been the subject of\r\nany particular chemical research; their microscopic structure has been\r\ninvestigated by Vogl.[2242]\r\n\r\n[2238] Consul Skene—_Reports of H.

Gray;[2244] in the Viti or Fiji Islands from _S. Yasi_\r\nSeem.; in New Caledonia from _S. austro-caledonicum_, Vieill;[2245] and\r\nin Western Australia from _Fusanus spicatus_ Br.

The wood is also\r\nreferred to in the ancient Sanskrit epic poems, the _Rāmāyana_ and\r\n_Mahabharata_, parts of which may be of nearly as early date.\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Periplus of the Erythrean Sea_, written about the\r\nmiddle of the 1st century, enumerates sandal-wood (Ξύλα σαγαλίνα) among\r\nthe Indian commodities imported into Omana in the Persian Gulf.[2247]\r\n\r\nThe Τζανδάνα mentioned towards the middle of the 6th century by Cosmas\r\nIndicopleustes,[2248] as brought to Taprobane (Ceylon) from China and\r\nother emporia, was probably the wood under consideration.

In India it was used in the most sacred\r\nbuildings, of which a memorable example still exists in the famous\r\ngates of Somnath, supposed to be 1000 years old.[2250]\r\n\r\nIn the 11th century sandal-wood was found among the treasures of the\r\nEgyptian khalifs, as stated in our article on camphor at page 511.\r\n\r\nAmong European writers, Constantinus Africanus, who flourished at\r\nSalerno in the 11th century, was one of the earliest to mention\r\nSandalum.[2251] Ebn Serabi, called Serapion the Younger, who lived\r\nabout the same period, was acquainted with _white_, _yellow_, and\r\n_red_ sandal-wood.[2252] All three kinds of sandal-wood also occur in\r\na list of drugs[2253] in use at Frankfort, _circa_ A.D. 1450; and in\r\nthe _Compendium Aromatariorum_ of Saladinus, published in 1488, we find\r\nmentioned as proper to be kept by the Italian apothecary,—“_Sandali\r\ntrium generum, scilicet albi, rubii et citrini_.”\r\n\r\nWhether the _red_ sandal here coupled with _white_ and _yellow_ was\r\nthe inodorous wood of _Pterocarpus santalinus_, now called _Lignum\r\nsantalinum rubrum_ or _Red Sanders_ (see p. 199), is extremely\r\ndoubtful. It may have meant real sandal wood, of which three shades,\r\ndesignated _white_, _red_, and _yellow_, are still recognized by the\r\nIndian traders.[2254]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we learn from Barbosa[2255] that about 1511 _white_\r\nand _yellow_ sandal-wood were worth at Calicut on the Malabar Coast\r\nfrom eight to ten times as much as the _red_, which would show that in\r\nhis day the red was not a mere variety of the other two, but something\r\nfar cheaper, like the Red Sanders Wood of modern commerce.\r\n\r\nIn 1635 the subsidy levied on sandal-wood imported into England was\r\n1_s._ per lb. on the _white_, and 2_s._ per lb. on the _yellow_.[2256]\r\n\r\n[2249] I. 222 in the work quoted in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[2250] They are 11 feet high and 9 feet wide, and richly carved out\r\nof sandal-wood; they were constructed for the temple of Somnath in\r\nGuzerat, once esteemed the holiest temple in India. On its destruction\r\nin A.D. 1025, the gates were carried off to Ghuzni in Afghanistan,\r\nwhere they remained until the capture of that city by the English in\r\n1842, when they were taken back to India.

In Mysore, where sandal-wood is most extensively produced, the\r\ntrees all belong to Government, and can only be felled by the proper\r\nofficers. This privilege was conferred on the East India Company by a\r\ntreaty with Hyder Ali, made 8 August 1770, and the monopoly has been\r\nmaintained to the present day. The Mysore animal exports of sandal wood\r\nare about 700 tons, valued at £27,000.[2257] They are shipped from\r\nMangalore.\r\n\r\nA similar monopoly existed in the Madras Presidency until a few years\r\nago, when it was abandoned. But sandal-wood is still a source of\r\nrevenue to the Madras Government, which by the systematic management of\r\nthe Forest Department has of late years been regularly increasing. The\r\nquantity of sandal-wood felled in the Reserved Forests during the year\r\n1872-3 was returned as 15,329 maunds (547½ tons).[2258]\r\n\r\nThe sandal-wood tree, which is indigenous to the regions just\r\nmentioned, used to be reproduced by seeds sown spontaneously or by\r\nbirds; but it is now being raised in regular plantations, the seeds\r\nbeing sown two or three in a hole with a chili (_Capsicum_) seed, the\r\nlatter producing a quick-growing seedling which shades the sandal while\r\nyoung.[2259] It is probable that the nurse-plant affords _sustenance_,\r\nfor it has been shown[2260] that _Santalum_ is parasitic, its roots\r\nattaching themselves by tuber-like processes to those of many other\r\nplants; and it is also said that young sandal plants thrive best when\r\ngrass is allowed to grow up in the seed-beds.\r\n\r\nThe trees attain their prime in 20 to 30 years, and have then trunks\r\nas much as a foot in diameter. A tree having been felled, the branches\r\nare lopped off, and the trunk allowed to lie on the ground for several\r\nmonths, during which time the white ants eat away the greater part of\r\nthe inodorous sapwood. The trunk is then roughly trimmed, sawn into\r\nbillets 2 to 2½ feet long, and taken to the forest depots. There the\r\nwood is weighed, subjected to a second and more careful trimming, and\r\nclassified according to quality. In some parts it is customary not to\r\nfell but to dig the tree up; in others the root is dug up after the\r\ntrunk has been cut down,—the root affording valuable wood, which with\r\nthe chips and sawdust are preserved for distillation, or for burning in\r\nthe native temples. The sap wood and branches are worthless.[2261]\r\n\r\n[2257] B. H.

A trifling payment for permission to cut growing\r\ntimber of any kind was the only barrier placed on the felling of the\r\ntrees. The farmers employed their teams during the dull season in\r\nbringing to Perth or Guildford the logs of sandal which had been felled\r\nand trimmed in the bush; and there was a flourishing trade so long as\r\ntrees of a fair size could be obtained within 100 or even 150 miles\r\nof the towns, where the commodity was worth £6 to £6 10_s._ per ton.\r\nBut the ill-regulated and improvident destruction of the trees in the\r\nmore easily accessible districts has so reduced their numbers that the\r\ntrade in that part of Australia soon came to an end.[2262] Australian\r\nsandal-wood appears however to be still an article of commerce, if one\r\nmay draw such an inference from the fact that 47,904 cwt. of sandal\r\nwood were imported into Singapore from Australia in the year 1872. It\r\nwas mostly re-shipped to China.[2263]\r\n\r\n=Description=—sandal-wood is not much known in English commerce, and\r\nis by no means always to be found even in London. That which we have\r\nexamined, and which we believe was Indian, was in cylindrical logs,\r\nmostly about 6 inches in diameter (the largest 8 inches—smallest 3:\r\ninches) and 3 to 4 feet long, extremely ponderous; the bark had been\r\nremoved. A transverse section of sandal-wood exhibits it of a pale\r\nbrown, marked with rather darker concentric zones and (when seen under\r\na lens) numerous open pores. The tissue is traversed by medullary rays,\r\nalso perceptible by the aid of a lens. The wood splits easily, emitting\r\nwhen comminuted an agreeable odour which is remarkably persistent; it\r\nhas a strongish aromatic taste.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of sandal-wood are not classified by the few persons\r\nwho deal in the article in London, and we are unable to point out\r\ncharacters by which they may be distinguished. In the price-currents of\r\ncommercial houses in China three sorts of sandal-wood are enumerated,\r\nnamely, _South Sea Island_, _Timor_, and _Malabar_; the last fetches\r\nthree or four times as high a price as either of the others. Even the\r\nIndian sandal-wood may vary in an important manner. Beddome,[2264]\r\nconservator of forests in Madras, and an excellent observer, remarks\r\nthat the finest sandal-wood is that which has grown slowly on rocky,\r\ndry and poor land; and that the trees found in a rich alluvial soil,\r\nthough of very fine growth, produce no heartwood and are consequently\r\nvalueless. A variety of the tree with more lanceolate leaves (var.\r\nβ _myrtifolium_ DC.), native of the eastern mountains of the Madras\r\nPresidency, affords a sandal-wood which is nearly inodorous.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The woody rays or wedges show a breadth varying\r\nfrom 35 to 420 mkm., the primary being frequently divided by secondary\r\nmedullary rays. These latter rays consist of one, often of two, rows\r\nof cells of the usual form. The woody tissue which they enclose is\r\nchiefly made up of small ligneous fibres with pointed ends, some larger\r\nparenchymatous cells, and thick-walled vessels. The resin and essential\r\noil reside chiefly in the medullary rays, as shown by the darker colour\r\nof these latter.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most important constituent is the essential\r\noil, which the wood yields to the extent of from 2 to 5 per cent.[2265]\r\nIn India, with imperfect stills, 2·5 per cent. of the oil are obtained;\r\nthe roots yield the largest amount and the finest quality of it.[2266]\r\nIt is a light yellow, thick liquid, possessing the characteristic odour\r\nof sandal; that which we examined had a sp. gr. of 0·963. We did not\r\nsucceed in finding a fixed boiling point of the oil; it began to boil\r\nat 214° C., but the temperature quickly rose to 255°, the oil acquiring\r\na darker hue. Oil of sandal-wood varies much in the strength and\r\ncharacter of its aroma, according to the sort of wood from which it is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n[2262] Millett, _An Australian Parsonage_, Lond., 1872, 43. 95. 382.\r\n\r\n[2263] _Straits Settlements Blue Book for 1872_, Singapore, 1873. 298.\r\n347.—It is possible that the sandal-wood in question may have been the\r\nproduce of the South Sea Islands, shipped from an Australian port.\r\n\r\n[2264] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\n[2265] Information obligingly communicated by Messrs. Schimmel and Co.,\r\nLeipzig (1878).\r\n\r\n[2266] Dr. Bidie, in _Pharmacopœia of India_, 1868, p. 461.\r\n\r\nThe oil as largely prepared by Messrs. Schimmel & Co., in a column\r\n100 millimetres long, deviates the plane of polarization 18·6° to\r\nthe _left_. Oil of Venezuela sandal-wood, from the same distillers,\r\nexamined in the same manner, deviates 6°·75 to the _right_.\r\n\r\nFrom the wood, treated with boiling alcohol, we obtained about 7 per\r\ncent. of a blackish extract, from which a tannate was precipitated\r\nby alcoholic solution of acetate of lead. Decomposed by sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, the tannate yielded a tannic acid having but little colour,\r\nand striking a greenish hue with a ferric salt. The extract also\r\ncontained a dark resin.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The greatest trade in sandal-wood is in China, which country\r\nin the year 1866 imported at the fourteen treaty ports then open 87,321\r\npeculs, equivalent to 5,197 tons; of this vast quantity the city of\r\nHankow on the river Yangtsze, received no less than 61,414 peculs, or\r\nmore than seven times as much as any other port.[2267] The imports into\r\nHankow have recently been much smaller, namely, 14,989 peculs in 1871\r\nand 12,798 peculs in 1872.[2268] On the other hand, Shanghai lying near\r\nthe mouth of the same great river, imported in 1872, 59,485 peculs of\r\nsandal-wood, the estimated value of which was about £100,000. In 1877\r\nthe imports of all China were 72,934 peculs.\r\n\r\nA considerable trade in sandal-wood is done in Bombay, the quantity\r\nimported thither annually being about 650 tons, and the animal export\r\nabout 400 tons.[2269]\r\n\r\nOil of sandal-wood is largely manufactured on the ghats between\r\nMangalore and Mysore, where fuel for the stills is abundant. Official\r\nreturns[2270] represent the quantity of the oil imported into Bombay\r\nin the year 1872-73 as 10,348 lbs., value £8,374; 4,500 lbs. were\r\nre-exported by sea.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The essential oil has of late been prescribed as a substitute\r\nfor copaiba, otherwise sandal-wood has hardly any uses in modern\r\nEuropean medicine. It is employed as a perfume and for the fabrication\r\nof small articles of ornament. Among the natives of India it is\r\nlargely consumed in the celebration of sepulchral rites, wealthy\r\nHindus showing their respect for a departed relative by adding sticks\r\nof sandal-wood to the funereal pile. The powder of the wood made into\r\na paste with water is used for making the caste mark, and also for\r\nmedicinal purposes. The consumption of sandal-wood in China appears to\r\nbe principally for the incense used in the temples.\r\n\r\n[2267] _Reports on Trade at the ports in China open to foreign trade\r\nfor 1866_, published by order of the Inspector-General of Customs,\r\nShanghai, 1867. 120. 121.—One pecul = 133⅓ lb.\r\n\r\n[2268] _Commercial Reports of H.

Laricio_ Poiret; and in\r\nSouth-western France, _P. Pinaster_ Solander (_P. maritima_ Poiret),\r\nextensively cultivated as the _Pin maritime_, yield turpentine in their\r\nrespective countries.\r\n\r\n2. _American_—In the United States, the conifers most important for\r\nterebinthinous products are the Swamp Pine, _Pinus australis_ Michaux\r\n(_P. palustris_ Mill.), and the Loblolly Pine, _P. Tæda_ L.\r\n\r\n=History=—The resin of pines and firs was well known to the ancients,\r\nwho obtained it in much the same manner as that practised at the\r\npresent day. The turpentine used in this country has for many years\r\npast been derived from North America. Up to the last century, both\r\nit and the substance called _Common Frankincense_ were imported from\r\nFrance. The late civil war in the United States and the blockade of the\r\nSouthern ports, occasioned a great scarcity of American turpentine; and\r\nterebinthinous substances from all other countries were poured into the\r\nLondon market. The actual supplies, however, were mainly furnished by\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nKopp[2271] quotes a passage showing that the essential oil of\r\nturpentine was known to Marcus Græcus, who termed it _Aqua ardens_.\r\nThis almost unknown personage is the reputed inventor of _Greek Fire_,\r\na dreaded engine of destruction in mediæval warfare.\r\n\r\n=Secretion=—The primary formation of resin-ducts in the bark of\r\nconiferous trees has been explained by Dippel,[2272] Müller,[2273] and\r\nFrank.[2274] The subsequent diffusion of the resinous juice through\r\nthe heartwood, sapwood, and bark, has been elaborately investigated by\r\nHugo von Mohl.[2275] From the various forms under which this diffusion\r\nexists in the different species have arisen the diverse methods of\r\nobtaining the terebinthinous resins.\r\n\r\n[2271] _Geschichte der Chemie_, iv. (1847) 392.\r\n\r\n[2272] _Botanische Zeitung_, 1863.\r\n\r\n[2273] Pringsheim, _Jahrb. für wissenschaftl. Botanik._ 1866.\r\n\r\n[2274] _Beiträge zur Pflanzenphysiologie_, Leipzig, 1868. 119.\r\n\r\n[2275] _Botanische Zeitung_, 1859. 329.\r\n\r\nThus in the wood of the Silver Fir (_Pinua Picea_ L.) resin-ducts are\r\naltogether wanting;—and led by experience, the Alpine peasant collects\r\nthe turpentine of this tree by simply puncturing the little cavities\r\nwhich form under its bark. In the Scotch Pine (_P. silvestris_ L.),\r\nthey are more abundant in the wood than in the bark, a fact which\r\nmight be anticipated by observing how rarely this tree exudes resin\r\nspontaneously.\r\n\r\nOil of turpentine, like volatile oils in general, undergoes on\r\nexposure to the air certain alterations giving rise to what is called\r\n_resinification_. The formic acid which is produced in small quantity\r\nduring this change characterizes it as one of oxidation; the chief\r\nproducts however are not exactly known, and not one of them has\r\nbeen proved identical with any natural resin. The common assumption\r\nthat resins are produced from volatile oils by simple oxidation, is\r\nconsequently not yet entirely justified.\r\n\r\n=Extraction=—In the United States[2276] turpentine is obtained to the\r\nlargest extent from _Pinus australis_, of which tree there are vast\r\nforests, the piny woods or pine-barrens, extending from Virginia to the\r\nMexican Gulf, especially through North and South Carolina, Georgia and\r\nAlabama. But it is in North Carolina that the extraction of turpentine\r\nis principally carried on.\r\n\r\nIn the winter, _i.e._ from November to March, the negroes in a\r\n_Turpentine Orchard_, as the district of forest to be worked is called,\r\nare occupied in making in the trunks of the trees, cavities which\r\nare technically known as _boxes_. For this purpose a long narrow axe\r\nis used, and some skill is required to wield it properly. The boxes\r\nare made from 6 to 12 inches above the ground, and are shaped like a\r\ndistended waistcoat-pocket, the bottom being about 4 inches below the\r\nlower lip, and 8 or 10 below the upper. On a tree of medium size, a box\r\nshould be made to hold a quart. The less the axe approaches the centre\r\nof the tree the better, as vitality is the less endangered. An expert\r\nworkman will make a box in less than 10 minutes. From one to four boxes\r\nare made in each tree, a few inches of bark being left between them.\r\nThe greater number of trees from which turpentine is now obtained, are\r\nfrom 12 to 18 inches in diameter, and have three boxes each.\r\n\r\nThe boxes having been made, the bark and a little of the wood\r\nimmediately beneath it, which are above the box, are _hacked_; and from\r\nthis excoriation, the sap begins to flow about the middle of March,\r\ngradually filling the box. Each tree requires to be freshly hacked\r\nevery 8 or 10 days, a very slight wound above the last being all that\r\nis needed. The hacking is carried on year after year, until it reaches\r\n12 to 15 feet or more, ladders being used. The turpentine, which is\r\ncalled _dip_, is removed from the boxes by a spoon or ladle of peculiar\r\nform, and collected into barrels, which are made on the spot and are of\r\nvery rude construction. The first year’s flow of a new tree, having but\r\na small surface to traverse before it reaches the box, is of special\r\ngoodness and is termed _Virgin dip_.\r\n\r\n[2276] The account here given is taken from F. L. Olmsted’s _Journey in\r\nthe Seaboard Slave States_, New York, 1856, p. 338, etc.\r\n\r\nThe turpentine which concretes upon the trunk is occasionally scraped\r\noff and barrelled by itself, and is known in the market as _scrape_, or\r\nby English druggists as _Common Frankincense_ or _Gum thus_.\r\n\r\nAlthough a large amount of turpentine is shipped to the northern ports\r\nfor distillation, a still larger is distilled in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe turpentine orchards. Copper stills are used, capable of containing\r\n5 to 20 barrels of turpentine. The turpentine is distilled without\r\nwater, the volatile oil as it flows from the worm being received in\r\nthe barrel in which it is afterwards sent to market. When all the oil\r\nthat can be profitably drawn off has been obtained, a spigot is removed\r\nfrom an opening in the bottom of the still, and the residual _Rosin_,\r\nappearing as a viscid fluid-like molasses, is allowed to flow out. Only\r\nthe first qualities of rosin, as that obtained from _Virgin dip_, are\r\ngenerally considered worth saving, the less pure sorts being simply\r\nallowed to run to waste. When it is intended to save the rosin, the\r\nlatter is drawn off into a vat of water, which separates the chips and\r\nother rubbish, and the rosin is then placed in barrels for the market.\r\nA North Carolina turpentine orchard will remain productive under\r\nordinary treatment for fifty years.\r\n\r\nThe collection of turpentine in the departments of the Landes and\r\nGironde in the south-west of France, is performed in a more rational\r\nmanner than in America, inasmuch as the plan of making deep cavities\r\nin the tree for the purpose of receiving the resin, is avoided by\r\nthe simple expedient of placing a suitable vessel beneath the lowest\r\nincision.[2277] The turpentine which concretes upon the stem is termed\r\nin France _Galipot_ or _Barras_.\r\n\r\n[2277] For further particulars, see Guibourt, _Hist. des drog._ ii.\r\n(1869) 259, also Curie, _Produits résineux du Pin maritime_. Paris\r\n1874. 24 pages, 1 plate; Matthieu, _Flore forestière_ 1860, p. 353.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Common turpentine is chiefly of two varieties, namely,\r\n_American_ and _Bordeaux_; the first alone is commonly found in the\r\nEnglish market.\r\n\r\n_=American Turpentine=_—A viscid honey-like fluid, of yellowish colour,\r\nsomewhat opaque, but becoming transparent by exposure to the air; it\r\nhas an agreeable odour and warm bitterish taste. When long kept in a\r\nbottle, it is seen to separate into two layers, the upper clear and\r\nfaintly fluorescent, the lower somewhat turbid or granular. When the\r\nlatter portion is examined under the microscope, it is found to consist\r\nmainly of minute crystals of peculiar curved or bluntly elliptic form.\r\nThese crystals are abietic acid; when the turpentine is warmed, the\r\ncrystals are speedily dissolved.\r\n\r\n_Bordeaux Turpentine_—in all essential particulars agrees with American\r\nTurpentine; it appears to separate rather more readily than the latter\r\ninto two layers,—a transparent and an opaque or crystalline.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The turpentines are mixtures of resin and\r\nessential oil. The latter, which amounts to from 15 to 30 per cent.,\r\nconsists for the greater part of various hydrocarbons, corresponding\r\nto the formula C₁₀H₁₆. Many of the crude turpentine oils, and some of\r\nthem even after rectification, are energetically acted on by metallic\r\nsodium. This reaction proves the presence of a certain quantity of\r\noxygenated oils, not one of which has thus far been isolated.\r\n\r\nThe turpentine oils, although agreeing in composition, exhibit a\r\nseries of physical differences according to their origin. One and the\r\nsame tree, indeed, yields from its several organs oils of different\r\nproperties. The boiling point varies between 152° and 172° C. The\r\nsp. gr. at mean temperatures ranges from 0·856 to 0·870. Greater\r\ndifferences are exhibited in the optical properties, some varieties\r\nof the oil turning the plane of polarization to the right, others to\r\nthe left. This rotatory power differs in many cases from that of the\r\nturpentine from which the oil was derived.[2278] The odour of oil of\r\nturpentine varies with the species from which it has been obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen crude turpentine is distilled with water, nearly the whole of\r\nthe oil passes over, while the resin remains. This resin is called\r\n_Colophony_ or _Rosin_. When it still contains a little water, it is\r\ndistinguished in English trade as _Yellow Rosin_; when fully deprived\r\nof water, it becomes what is called _Transparent Rosin_. That of deeper\r\ncolour acquired by a still longer application of heat, bears the name\r\nof _Black Rosin_.\r\n\r\nColophony softens at 80° C., and melts completely at 100° into a clear\r\nliquid. At about 150° it forms a somewhat darker liquid, but without\r\nundergoing a loss in weight; at higher temperatures, it gradually\r\ndecomposes. Pure colophony has a sp. gr. of 1·07, and is homogeneous,\r\ntransparent, amorphous, and very brittle. At temperatures between 15°\r\nand 20° C., it requires for solution 8 parts of dilute alcohol (0·883).\r\nOn addition of a caustic alkali, it dissolves in spirit much more\r\nfreely. It is plentifully soluble in acetone or benzol.\r\n\r\nThe composition of colophony agrees with the formula C₄₄H₆₂O₄. By\r\nshaking coarsely powdered colophony with warm dilute alcohol, it is\r\nconverted into a crystalline body, _Abietic Acid_, C₄₄H₆₄O₅,—a result\r\ndue simply to hydration. Under such treatment, colophony yields 80 to\r\n90 per cent. of abietic acid,[2279] and therefore consists chiefly of\r\nthe anhydride of that acid. This is probably the case with the resins\r\nof other conifers. The living tree contains only the anhydride, for\r\nthe fresh resinous juice is clear and amorphous after the expulsion\r\nof the oil; and when exposed to the air it loses oil, takes up water\r\nand solidifies as the crystalline acid,—a change which may easily be\r\ntraced by the aid of the microscope, in drops taken direct from the\r\ntrunk. Amorphous colophony retains its transparency even in a moist\r\natmosphere, and appears to be capable of passing into the state of\r\nabietic acid, only when the assumption of the needful molecule of\r\nwater is aided, in nature by the presence of the essential oil, or\r\nartificially by that of alcohol.\r\n\r\n[2278] For some particulars, see my notice in the _Jahresbericht_ of\r\nWiggers and Husemann for 1869, p. 36.—F. A. F.\r\n\r\n[2279] Flückiger in _loc. cit._ 1867. 36.—Most chemists assign to this\r\nacid the formula C₂₀H₃₀O₂, and call it _silvic acid_.\r\n\r\nColophony when boiled with alkaline solutions forms greasy salts of\r\nabietic acid, the so-ccalled _resin-soaps_, which are used as additions\r\nto other soaps.\r\n\r\nSiewert’s _Silvic Acid_ is regarded by Maly (1864) as a product of the\r\ndecomposition of abietic acid; and the _Pimaric_, _Pinic_ and _Silvic\r\nAcids_ of former investigators, as impure abietic acid. Pimaric acid\r\nhowever, which is the chief constituent of _Galipot_, appears to be\r\ndecidedly different, so far as we can judge from the experiments of\r\nDuvernoy (1865) and of one of ourselves (F.).\r\n\r\nAbietic acid, as well as the unaltered coniferous resins, deviate\r\nthe ray of polarized light, whereas American colophony, dissolved in\r\nacetone, is devoid of optical power.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The supplies of turpentine are chiefly derived from the\r\nUnited States, but the trade has undergone a great change, as shown by\r\nthe following figures, which represent the quantities imported in the\r\nseveral years:—\r\n\r\n       1869       1870         1871        1872\r\n    60,468 cwt.  51,257 cwt.  2,231 cwt.  1,000 cwt.\r\n\r\nThis greatly diminished importation of the crude article is partially\r\nexplained by a larger importation of Oil of Turpentine and Rosin;\r\nbut the increase is by no means sufficient to account for the vast\r\ndiminution indicated by the above figures. The quantities of these\r\nlatter articles imported into the United Kingdom during the year 1872\r\nwere as follows:—_Oil of Turpentine_, 220,292 cwt., value £470,085,\r\nsix-sevenths being furnished by the United States of America and the\r\nremainder chiefly by France. _Rosin_, 919,494 cwt., value £492,246; of\r\nthis quantity, the United States supplied nine-tenths, and France the\r\nlarger part of the remainder.[2280]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Turpentine, Common Frankincense and Colophony are ingredients\r\nof certain plasters and ointments. Oil of turpentine is occasionally\r\nadministered internally as a vermifuge or diuretic, and applied\r\nexternally as a stimulant. But these substances are immeasurably less\r\nimportant in medicine than in the arts.\r\n\r\nThus Americanum vel vulgare.\r\n\r\nThis substance, known among druggists as _Common Frankincense_ or _Gum\r\nThus_, is the resin which, as explained at p. 605, concretes upon the\r\nstems of the pines in the American turpentine orchards, and is there\r\ncalled _Scrape_. It corresponds to the _Galipot_ or _Barras_ of the\r\nFrench, which in old times supplied its place.\r\n\r\nIt is a semi-opaque, softish resin, of a pale yellow colour, smelling\r\nof turpentine; it is generally mixed with pine leaves, bits of wood\r\nand other impurities, so that it requires straining before it is used.\r\nBy keeping, it becomes dry and brittle, of deeper colour and milder\r\nodour. Under the microscope, it exhibits a crystalline structure due\r\nto _Abietic Acid_, of which it chiefly consists. It is imported from\r\nAmerica in barrels, but in insignificant quantities and only for\r\nthe druggist’s use. Sometimes, however, it is distilled as common\r\nturpentine.\r\n\r\nDry pine resin, of which Common Frankincense is the type, evolves when\r\nheated an agreeable smell; hence in ancient times it was commonly used\r\nin English churches in place of the more costly olibanum. At present it\r\nis scarcely employed except in a few plasters.\r\n\r\n[2280] _Annual Statement of the Trade of the U.K. for 1872._ pp. 53.\r\n56. 60. 210.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEREBINTHINA VENETA.\r\n\r\n    _Terebinthina Laricina_; _Venice Turpentine_,\r\n        _Larch Turpentine_; F. _Térébenthine de\r\n        Venise ou de Briançon_, _Térébenthine du\r\n        mélèze_; G. _Venetianischer Terpenthin_,\r\n        _Lärchen-Terpenthin_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Pinus Larix_ L. (_Larix europæa_ DC.), a tall\r\nforest tree of the mountains of Southern Central Europe, from Dauphiny\r\nthrough the Alps to Styria and the Carpathians, ascending to an\r\nelevation of 3000 to 5500 feet above the sea-level. It is largely grown\r\nin plantations in England and also, since 1738, in Scotland.\r\n\r\n=History=—The turpentine of the larch was known to Dioscorides as\r\nimported from the Alpine regions of Gaul.[2281] Pliny also was\r\nacquainted with it, for he correctly remarks that it does not harden.\r\nGalen in the 2nd century also mentions it, admitting that it may well\r\nbe substituted for Chian turpentine (see p. 165), the true, legitimate\r\n_Terebinthina_. Yet even in the beginning of the 17th century many\r\npharmacologists complained of such a substitution. Mattioli[2282] gave\r\nan account of the method of collecting it about Trent in the Tirol,\r\nby boring the trees to the centre, which is true to the present day.\r\nIt used formerly to be exported from Venice, then the great emporium\r\nfor drugs of all kinds; the turpentine may even at times have been\r\ncollected in the territories of the Venetian republic. We find it\r\nexpressly called _Terebinthina Veneta_ by Guintherus of Andernach.[2283]\r\n\r\nThe name _larch_ seems to belong to the turpentine rather than to the\r\ntree. Dioscorides says the resin is called by the natives λάρικα, and\r\na similar name is mentioned by Galen. In Pasi’s _Tariffa de pesi e\r\nmisure_, 1521 (see Appendix), we find “_Termentina sive Larga_,”—and\r\n_larga_ is still an Italian name for larch turpentine. The peasants of\r\nthe Southern Tirol call it _Lerget_, and in Switzerland the common name\r\nin German is _Lörtsch_.\r\n\r\n=Extraction=—Larch turpentine is collected in the Tirol, chiefly\r\nabout Mals, Meran, Botzen and Trent. A very small amount is obtained\r\noccasionally in the Valais in Switzerland, and in localities in\r\nPiedmont and France where the larch is found. The resin is obtained\r\nfrom the heartwood, by making in the spring a narrow cavity reaching to\r\nthe centre of the stem at about a foot from the ground. This is then\r\nstopped up until the autumn of the same or of the following year, when\r\nit is opened and the resin taken out with an iron spoon. If only one\r\nhole is thus made, the tree yields about half a pound yearly without\r\nappreciable detriment. But if on the other hand a number of wide holes\r\nare made, and especially if they are left open, as was formerly the\r\npractice in the Piedmontese and French Alps, a larger product amounting\r\nto as much as 8 lb. is obtained annually, but the tree ceases to yield\r\nafter some years, and its wood is much impaired in value.\r\n\r\n[2281] Lib. i. cap. 92.\r\n\r\n[2282] _Comment. in libr. i. Dioscoridis_, Venetiis, 1565. 106.\r\n\r\n[2283] _De medicina veteri et nova etc._, Basileæ, 1571. 183.\r\n\r\nMohl, who witnessed the collection of this turpentine in the Southern\r\nTirol,[2284] observed that when a growing larch stem was sawn through,\r\nthe resin flowed most abundantly from the heartwood, and in smaller\r\nquantity, though somewhat more quickly, from the sapwood, and that\r\nthe bark contained but few resin-ducts. The practice of closing the\r\ncavities is adopted, not only for the sake of preserving the wood\r\nand for the greater convenience of removing the turpentine, but also\r\nbecause it tends to maintain the transparency and purity of the latter.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Venice turpentine is a thick, honey-like fluid, slightly\r\nturbid, yet not granular and crystalline; it has a pale yellowish\r\ncolour and exhibits a slight fluorescence. Its odour resembles that\r\nof common turpentine, but is less powerful; its taste is bitter and\r\naromatic. When exposed to the air, it thickens but slowly to a clear\r\nvarnish, and hardens but very slowly when mixed with magnesia. Larch\r\nturpentine, though common on the Continent, is seldom imported into\r\nEngland,[2285] and the article sold for it is almost always spurious.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Larch turpentine dissolves in spirit of wine,\r\nforming a clear liquid which reddens litmus; hot water agitated with it\r\nalso acquires a faint acid reaction, due to formic and probably also\r\nto succinic acid. Glacial acetic acid, amylic alcohol, and acetone\r\nmix with it perfectly. By distillation it yields on an average 15 per\r\ncent. of essential oil of the composition, C₁₀H₁₆, which boils at 157°\r\nC., and when saturated with dry hydrochloric acid gas, easily produces\r\ncrystals of the compound C₁₀H₁₆ + HCl. The residual resin is soluble\r\nin two parts of warm alcohol of 75 per cent., and more copiously in\r\nconcentrated alcohol.\r\n\r\nTwo parts of the turpentine diluted with one of benzol or acetone\r\ndeviate the ray of polarized light 9·5° to the _right_. The essential\r\noil deviates 6·4° to the _left_; the resin perfectly freed from\r\nvolatile oil and dissolved in half its weight of acetone, deviates\r\n12·6° to the _right_ in a column 50 mm. long.\r\n\r\nWe have not succeeded in preparing a crystallized acid from the resin\r\nof Venice turpentine, although its composition according to _Maly_\r\n(1864) is the same as that of American colophony, which is easily\r\ntransformed into crystallized abietic acid.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Venice turpentine appears to possess no medicinal properties\r\nthat are not equally found in other substances of the same class, and\r\nas a medicine it has fallen into disuse. But in name at least it is in\r\nfrequent requisition for horse and cattle medicines.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Alston (1740-60) said of Venice turpentine[2286] that\r\nit is seldom found in the shops,—a remark equally true at the present\r\nday, for but few druggists trouble themselves to procure it genuine.\r\nThe Venice turpentine usually sold is an artificial mixture of common\r\nresin and oil of turpentine, which may be easily distinguished from the\r\nproduct of the larch by the facility with which it dries when spread on\r\na piece of paper,[2287] and by its stronger turpentine smell.\r\n\r\n[2284] _Botanische Zeitung_, xvii. (1859) 329, abstracted in the\r\n_Jahresbericht_ of Wiggers, 1859. 18.\r\n\r\n[2285] On one occasion I observed Venice Turpentine in a public drug\r\nsale in London, 21 barrels imported from Trieste being offered, 14\r\nJuly, 1864.—D. H.\r\n\r\n[2286] _Lectures on the Materia Medica_, Lond. ii. (1770) 398.\r\n\r\n[2287] Thus if a thin layer of true Venice turpentine and another of\r\ncommon turpentine be spread on two sheets of paper it will be found\r\nafter the lapse of some weeks that the former cannot be touched without\r\nadhering to the fingers, while the latter will have become a dry, hard\r\nvarnish.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTEX LARICIS.\r\n\r\n_Larch Bark._\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Pinus Larix_ L.—see p. 609.\r\n\r\n=History=—The bark of the larch has long been known to possess\r\nastringent properties; hence it has been used in tanning.\r\nGerarde,[2288] who wrote near the close of the 16th century, likened it\r\nto that of the pine, which he described to be of a binding nature; but\r\nthere is no evidence that it was an officinal drug.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1858 larch bark was recommended by Dr. Frizell of\r\nDublin, and afterwards by other physicians, as a stimulating astringent\r\nand expectorant. In consequence of the favourable effects which have\r\nresulted from its use it has been included in the _Additions to the\r\nPharmacopœia of 1867_.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The bark that we have seen is in flattish pieces or\r\nlarge quills, externally reddish-brown. In those taken from older wood\r\nthere is a large amount of an exfoliating corky coat, displaying as\r\nit is removed bright rosy tints, while the liber is of a different\r\ntexture, slightly fibrous and whitish. The inner surface is smooth\r\nand of a pinkish-brown, or pale yellow. The bark breaks with a short\r\nfracture, exhaling an agreeable balsamic terebinthinous odour; it has a\r\nwell-marked astringent taste. For medicinal use the inner bark is to be\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—A transverse section exhibits resin-ducts, but\r\nfar less numerous than in the bark of many allied trees. The medullary\r\nrays are not very distinct. Throughout the middle layer of the bark\r\nlarge isolated thick-walled cells of very irregular shape are scattered.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Larch bark has been examined by Stenhouse,[2289]\r\nwho finds it to contain a considerable amount of a peculiar tannin,\r\nyielding olive-green precipitates with salts of iron. The same chemist\r\nalso discovered[2290] in larch bark an interesting crystallizable\r\nsubstance called _Larixin_ or _Larixinic Acid_, which has the\r\ncomposition C₁₀H₁₀O₅. It may be obtained by digesting the bark in\r\nwater in 80° C. and evaporating the infusion to a syrupy consistence.\r\nFrom this, by still further cautious heating in a retort, the larixin\r\nmay be distilled, during which operation some of it crystallizes on\r\nthe inner surface of the receiver, the remainder being dissolved in\r\nthe distilled liquor. From the latter it may be obtained in crystals\r\nby evaporation. The substance forms colourless crystals, sometimes\r\nas much as an inch long; it volatilizes even at 93° C., and melts at\r\n153°. It requires about 88 parts of water for solution at 15° C., but\r\nmore freely dissolves in boiling water or in alcohol. From ether, in\r\nwhich it is but sparingly soluble, it separates in brilliant crystals.\r\nThe solutions have a bitterish astringent taste and a slightly acid\r\nreaction, and assume a purple hue on addition of ferric chloride. When\r\na solution of baryta is added to a concentrated solution of larixin,\r\nthe latter being in excess, a bulky gelatinous precipitate falls; it\r\nis readily soluble in boiling water and is deposited again on cooling.\r\nStenhouse failed to obtain it either from the bark of _Pinus Abies_ L.,\r\nor from that of _P. silvestris_ L.\r\n\r\n[2288] _Herball, enlarged by Johnson_, Lond. 1636. 1366.\r\n\r\n[2289] _Proceedings of the Royal Society_, xi. (1862) 404.\r\n\r\n[2290] _Phil. Trans._, vol. 152 (1862) 53.—We write the name _Larixin_\r\ninstead of _Larixine_, with the concurrence of Dr. Stenhouse.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Larch bark, chiefly in the form of tincture, has been prescribed\r\nto check profuse expectoration in cases of chronic bronchitis; it has\r\nalso been found useful in arresting internal hæmorrhage.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEREBINTHINA CANADENSIS.\r\n\r\n_Balsamum Canadense_; _Canada Balsam_, _Canadian Turpentine_; F.\r\n_Térébenthine ou Baume de Canada_; G. _Canada Balsam_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Pinus balsamea_ L. (_Abies balsamea_ Marshall), the\r\nBalsam Fir or Balm of Gilead Fir, a handsome tree, 20 to 40 feet high,\r\nwith a trunk 6 to 12 inches in diameter, sometimes attaining still\r\nlarger dimensions, growing in profusion in the Northern and Western\r\nUnited States of America, Nova Scotia and Canada, but not observed\r\nbeyond 62° N. lat. It resembles the Silver Fir of Europe (_Pinus Picea_\r\nL.), but has the bracts short-pointed and the cones more acute at each\r\nend.\r\n\r\nCanada balsam is also furnished by _Pinus Fraseri_ Pursh, the\r\nSmall-fruited or Double Balsam Fir, a tree found on the mountains\r\nof Pennsylvania, Virginia, and southward on the highest of the\r\nAlleghanies.[2291]\r\n\r\n_Pinus canadensis_ L. (_Abies canadensis_ Michx.), the Hemlock Spruce\r\nor Pérusse, a large tree abundant in the same countries as _P.\r\nbalsamea_, and extending throughout British America to Alaska, is\r\nsaid to yield a similar turpentine, which however has not yet been\r\nsufficiently examined. The Hemlock Spruce is of considerable importance\r\non account of the resin collected from its trunk, and the essential oil\r\ndistilled from its foliage, the latter operation being performed on a\r\nlarge scale in Madison County, New York. The inner bark of the tree is\r\na valuable material for tanning.\r\n\r\n=History=—The French, in whose possession Canada remained until the\r\nyear 1763, were probably acquainted with Canada balsam long before\r\nthis period. Yet no mention of it is found in Pomet’s work, but in\r\n1759 it was at Strassburg a current article of the pharmacy.[2292] As\r\nto England, Lewis, in his _History of the Materia Medica_ published in\r\n1761, says that “_an elegant balsam_,” obtained from the Canada Fir, is\r\nsometimes brought into Europe under the name of _Balsamum Canadense_.\r\nCanada balsam was first introduced into the London Pharmacopœia in\r\n1788. From the books of a London druggist, J. Gurney Bevan, we find\r\nthat its wholesale price in 1776 was 4_s._, in 1788, 5_s._ per lb.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Canada balsam is a transparent resin of honey-like\r\nconsistence, and of a light straw-colour with a greenish tint. By\r\nkeeping, it slowly becomes thicker and of a somewhat darker hue, but\r\nalways retains its transparency. When carefully examined in direct\r\nsunlight, it exhibits a slight greenish fluorescence in the same degree\r\nas other turpentines or as copaiba; this optical power appears to\r\nincrease if the balsam is exposed to a heat of about 200° C.\r\n\r\n[2291] Asa Gray, _Botany of the Northern United States_, New York,\r\n1866. 422.\r\n\r\n[2292] Flückiger, _Pharm. Journ._ vi. (1876), 1021.\r\n\r\nCanada balsam has a pleasant aromatic odour and bitterish, feebly\r\nacrid, not disagreeable taste. On account of its flavour it is\r\nsometimes called _Balm of Gilead_, but erroneously, as this latter is\r\nderived from a tree of the genus _Balsamodendron_ growing in Arabia.\r\nWe found a good commercial balsam to have a sp. gr. of 0·998 at 14·5°\r\nC., water at the same temperature being 1·000. Four parts, mixed with\r\none of benzol and examined in a column of 50 mm. in length, deviated\r\na ray of polarized light 2° to the right. The balsam is perfectly\r\nsoluble in any proportion in chloroform, benzol, ether, or warm amylic\r\nalcohol; and the solution in each case reddens litmus. With sulphate\r\nof carbon it mixes readily, but the mixture is somewhat turbid.\r\nGlacial acetic acid, acetone or absolute alcohol dissolve the balsam\r\npartially, leaving, after ebullition and cooling, a considerable amount\r\nof amorphous residue. Colophony and Venice turpentine are completely\r\ndissolved by the liquids in question, as well as by spirit of wine\r\ncontaining 70 to 75 per cent. of alcohol.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Like all analogous exudations of the _Coniferæ_,\r\nCanada turpentine is a mixture of resins with an essential oil. If the\r\nlatter is allowed to evaporate, the former are left as a transparent,\r\nsomewhat tough and elastic mass. The proportion of the components is\r\nwithin certain limits, variable in different samples. The specimen\r\nbefore mentioned lost after an exposure in a steam-bath during several\r\ndays, no less than 20 per cent. of volatile oil, or even 24 per cent.\r\nif the experiment was made on a very small scale, as with 20 grammes or\r\nless in a thin layer.\r\n\r\nBy distillation with water, it is not easy to obtain more than 17 to\r\n18 per cent. of essential oil. The resin in this case is a tough,\r\nelastic, non-transparent mass, retaining obstinately a large proportion\r\nof water, which can only be removed by keeping it for some time at a\r\ntemperature of 100°-176° C.\r\n\r\nThe oil as obtained by distillation with water is colourless, and\r\nhas the odour of common oil of turpentine rather than the agreeable\r\nsmell of the balsam; it consists of an oil, C₁₀H₁₆, mixed with an\r\ninsignificant proportion of an oxygenated oil, the presence of which\r\nmay be proved by the slight evolution of hydrogen on addition of\r\nmetallic sodium, after the oil has been freed from water by contact\r\nwith fused chloride of calcium. After this treatment, a small\r\nproportion begins to distil at about 160°, but by far the larger part\r\nboils at 167° C., a small portion only distilling at last at 170° and\r\nabove. The oil obtained at 167°, examined under the conditions already\r\nmentioned, has a sp. gr. of 0·863, and the power of rotating a ray of\r\npolarized light 5·6° to the left. The portion distilling at 160° does\r\nnot differ in this respect; but that passing over at 170°, deviates the\r\nray 7·2° to the left. The oil readily dissolves a large proportion of\r\nglacial acetic acid; an equal weight of each mixes perfectly at about\r\n54° C., but some acetic acid separates on cooling.\r\n\r\nThe essential oil of Canada balsam, saturated with dry hydrochloric\r\nacid, does not yield a solid crystallizable compound; but this is\r\neasily obtained on addition of fuming nitric acid and gently heating,\r\nwhen the inside of the retort becomes covered by sublimed crystals of\r\nC₁₀H₁₆ + HCl.\r\n\r\nThus this oil in its general characters bears a close resemblance\r\nto the essential oils of the cones of _Pinus Picea_ L., and of the\r\nleaves of _P. Pumilio_ Hänke, and to most of the French varieties of\r\noil of turpentine, rather than to the American turpentine oils, which\r\nrotate to the right, and combine immediately with HCl to form a solid\r\ncrystalline compound.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the resin of Canada balsam is dextrogyre: two parts\r\nof it, entirely deprived of essential oil and dissolved in one of\r\nbenzol, deviating the ray 8·5° to the right. The optical powers of the\r\ntwo components (oil and resin) are therefore antagonistic.\r\n\r\nThe resin of Canada balsam consists however of two different bodies,\r\n78·7 per cent. of it being soluble in boiling absolute alcohol, and\r\n21·3 (in our specimen) remaining as an amorphous mass, readily soluble\r\nin ether. Neither the alcoholic nor the ethereal solution yields a\r\ncrystalline residue if allowed to evaporate. They redden litmus, but we\r\ndid not succeed in obtaining any crystallized resinous acid, crystals\r\nof which are formed if common turpentine or colophony is digested with\r\ndilute alcohol. Glacial acetic acid acts upon the resins like absolute\r\nalcohol. Caustic alkalis do not dissolve either the balsam or the\r\nresin; the former however is considerably thickened by incorporation\r\nwith ⅕ of its weight of recently calcined magnesia. If the mixture,\r\nmoistened with dilute alcohol, is kept at 93° C. for some days and\r\nfrequently stirred, a mass of hard consistence, finally translucent,\r\nresults. Caustic ammonia heated with the balsam in a closed bottle,\r\nforms a thick milky jelly, which does not afterwards separate.\r\n\r\nHence, according to our investigations, 100 parts of Canada turpentine\r\nconsist of\r\n\r\n    Essential oil, C₁₀H₁₆}, with a very small proportion of\r\n      an oxygenated oil                                         24\r\n    Resin soluble in boiling alcohol                            60\r\n    Resin soluble only in ether                                 16\r\n\r\nThe result of Wirzen’s examination of Canada balsam[2293] are not in\r\ncomplete accordance with those here stated. He found 16 per cent.\r\nof oil and three different amorphous resins, one of which had the\r\ncomposition of abietic acid.\r\n\r\n[2293] _De balsamis et præsertim de Balsamo Canadense_, Helsingforsiæ,\r\n1849,—abstracted in the _Jahresbericht_ of Wiggers for 1849. 38.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—Canada balsam is obtained either by\r\npuncturing the vesicles which form under the suberous envelope of the\r\ntrunk and branches, and collecting their fluid contents in a bottle, or\r\nby making incisions. It is obtained principally in Lower Canada, and\r\nis shipped from Montreal and Quebec, in kegs or large barrels. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Quebec, about 2000 gallons (20,000 lb.) used to be\r\ncollected annually; but in 1868, owing to distress among the farmers,\r\nthe quantity obtained was unusually large, and it was estimated that\r\nnearly 7000 gallons would be exported to England and the United\r\nStates.[2294] During a recent scarcity (1872-73) a sort of balsam from\r\nOregon has been substituted in the American market for true Canada\r\nbalsam.[2295]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The medicinal properties of Canada balsam resemble those\r\nof copaiba and other terebinthinous oleo-resins, yet it is now\r\nrarely employed as a remedy. The balsam is much valued for mounting\r\nobjects for the microscope, as it remains constantly transparent and\r\nuncrystalline. It is also used for making varnish.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEREBINTHINA ARGENTORATENSIS.\r\n\r\n_Strassburg Turpentine_; F. _Térébenthine d’Alsace ou de Strasbourg_,\r\n_Térébenthine du sapin_; G. _Strassburger Terpenthin_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Pinus Picea_ L. (_Abies pectinata_ DC.), the Silver\r\nFir,[2296] a large handsome tree, growing in the mountainous parts\r\nof Middle and Southern Europe from the Pyrenees to the Caucasus, and\r\nextending under a slightly different form (var. β. _cephalonica_) into\r\ncontinental Greece and the islands of Eubœa and Cephalonia.\r\n\r\n=History=—Belon in his treatise _De Arboribus coniferis_ (1553)\r\ndescribed this turpentine, which is also briefly yet accurately noticed\r\nby Samuel Dale,[2297] a learned apothecary of London and the friend of\r\nSloane and Ray. It had a place in the London Pharmacopœia until 1788,\r\nwhen it was omitted from the materia medica.\r\n\r\n=Extraction=—The oleo-resin of _P. Picea_, like that of _P. balsamea_,\r\nis contained in little swellings of the bark[2298] of young stems, and\r\nis extracted by the tedious process of puncturing them and receiving\r\nin a suitable vessel the one or two drops which exude from each. It is\r\nstill collected near Mutzig and Barr, in the Vosges (1878), though only\r\nto a very small extent.\r\n\r\n=Description=—An authentic sample collected for one of us by the\r\nSurveyor of Forests in the Bernese Jura, Switzerland, resembles very\r\nclosely Canada balsam, but is devoid of any distinct fluorescence. It\r\nhas a light yellow colour, a very fragrant odour,[2299] more agreeable\r\nthan that of Canada balsam, and is devoid of the acrid bitterish taste\r\nof the latter.\r\n\r\nWe found our specimen to have sp. gr. of distilled water. It deviates\r\na ray of polarized light 3° to the left, if examined either pure or\r\ndiluted with a fourth of its weight of benzol, in the manner described\r\nat p. 610. Our drug is soluble in the same liquids as the Canadian, yet\r\nis miscible with glacial acetic acid, absolute alcohol and acetone,\r\nwithout leaving any considerable flocculent residue. It is even soluble\r\nin spirit of wine, the solution being but very little turbid. The\r\nsolutions have an acid reaction.\r\n\r\n[2294] From information obligingly communicated by Mr. N.

By submitting half a pound of the turpentine to\r\ndistillation with water, we obtained 24 per cent. of essential oil,\r\nthe remaining resin being when cold perfectly friable. The fresh oil,\r\npurified by sodium, deviates the ray of polarized light to the left,\r\nwhereas the remaining resin, dissolved in half its weight of benzol,\r\nshows a weak dextrogyre rotation. The oil boils at 163° C. After having\r\nkept it for two years and a half in a well-stopped bottle, we find that\r\nit has become considerably thicker and now deviates to the right. If\r\nsaturated with dry hydrochloric acid, the oil does not yield a solid\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\nThis oil has nearly the same agreeable odour as the crude oleo-resin,\r\nyet the essential oil of the _cones_ of the same tree is still more\r\nfragrant. The latter is one of the most powerfully deviating oils,\r\nthe rotation being 51° to the left, and it is consequently extremely\r\ndifferent from the oil obtained from the turpentine of the stem, though\r\nits composition is represented by the same formula, C₁₀H₁₆.\r\n\r\nA peculiar sugar called _Abietite_, nearly related to mannite but\r\nhaving the composition C₁₂H₁₆O₆, has been detected by Rochleder[2300]\r\nin the leaves of the Silver Fir.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Strassburg turpentine possesses the properties of common\r\nturpentine, with the advantage of a very agreeable odour.

(_Abies excelsa_ DC.), the Norway\r\nSpruce Fir,[2301] a noble tree attaining an elevation of 100-160 feet,\r\nwidely distributed throughout Northern and the mountainous parts of\r\nCentral Europe, but not indigenous to Great Britain, though extensively\r\nplanted. In Russian Lapland it reaches at 68° N. lat. almost the\r\nextreme limit of tree-vegetation, while southward it extends to the\r\nSpanish Pyrenees. In the Alps it ascends to 6,000 feet above the level\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\n=History=—In accordance with the definition of the London\r\nPharmacopœias and the custom of English druggists the name _Burgundy\r\nPitch_ is restricted to the product of the above-named species.\r\nThe pharmacologists of France use an equivalent term with the same\r\nlimitations; but in other parts of the Continent _Pix Burgundica_ has\r\na wider meaning, and is allowed to include the turpentines of other\r\n_Coniferæ_. We here employ it in the English sense.\r\n\r\nParkinson, an apothecary of London and herbarist to King Charles I.,\r\nspeaks of “_Burgony Pitch_” as a thing well known in his time.[2302]\r\nDale in his _Pharmacologia_ (1693) mentions _Pix Burgundica_ as being\r\nimported into England from Germany, and it is also noticed by Salmon\r\n(1693), who says “it is brought to us out of Burgundy, Germany and\r\nother places near Strasburgh.”[2303]\r\n\r\n[2300] Wiggers and Husemann, _Jahresbericht_, 1868. 53.\r\n\r\n[2301] _Pesse_ or _Epicéa_ of the French; _Fichte_ or _Rothtanne_ of\r\nthe Germans.\r\n\r\n[2302] _Theater of Plants_, 1640. 1542.\r\n\r\n[2303] _Compleat English Physician_, 1693. 1031.\r\n\r\nPomet, writing in Paris about the same period, discards the prefix\r\n_Burgundy_ as a fiction, remarking that the best _Poix grasse_ comes\r\nfrom Holland and Strassburg.[2304]\r\n\r\nWhether this resin ever was collected in Burgundy we are unable to\r\ndetermine. It may probably have acquired the name through having been\r\nbrought into commerce from Switzerland and Alsace by way of Franche\r\nComté, otherwise called Comté de Bourgogne or Haute Bourgogne.[2305]\r\n\r\nBurgundy pitch is enumerated among the materia medica of the London\r\nPharmacopœia of 1677, and in every subsequent edition. In that of 1809\r\nit was defined under the name of _Pix arida_, as the _prepared resin of\r\nPinus Abies_.\r\n\r\n=Production=—Burgundy pitch is produced in Finland, in the Black Forest\r\nin the Grand Duchy of Baden, Austria and Switzerland. On the estate\r\nof Baron Linder at Svarta near Helsingfors, it is obtained by melting\r\nthe crude resin in contact with the vapour of water, and straining.\r\nThe quantity annually produced there was stated in 1867 to be 35,000\r\nkilogr. (689 cwt.);[2306] that afforded by an establishment at Ilm in\r\nthe same country amounted to 80,000 kilogr. (1,575 cwt.).[2307]\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Oppenau and on the Kniebis mountain in the\r\nGrand Duchy of Baden the stems of the firs are wounded at equal\r\ndistances by making perpendicular channels, 1½ inches wide and the\r\nsame in depth. The resin which exudes from these channels is scraped\r\noff with an iron instrument made for the purpose, and purified by\r\nbeing melted in hot water and strained. This is performed in three or\r\nfour small establishments at Oppenau and the neighbouring village of\r\nLöcherberg. In this state the resin, which is opaque and contains much\r\nmoisture, is called _Wasserharz_. By further straining and evaporating\r\na portion of the water its quality is improved.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture in that part of Germany is on the decline, partly in\r\nconsequence of the timber being injured by the wounding of the trees,\r\nso that the collecting of resin is not permitted in the large forests\r\nbelonging to the governments of Baden and Württemberg. We have had the\r\nopportunity of observing[2308] that in the establishments in question\r\nFrench turpentine or _galipot_, imported from Bordeaux, as well as\r\nAmerican rosin or colophony, are used in quantities certainly exceeding\r\nthat of the resin grown on the spot.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the last century some Burgundy pitch was produced,\r\naccording to Duhamel,[2309] in the present canton of Neuchâtel, but\r\nno such branch of industry is now pursued there, at least on a large\r\nscale. On the other hand, in the districts of Moutier and Delémont\r\nin the Bernese Jura this resin is still collected, though it is not\r\nknown as _Burgundy Pitch_, but is termed simply _Poix blanche_ (White\r\nPitch). The surveyor of the forests of this district, which is one of\r\nthe richest in _Pinus Abies_, has informed one of us that from 790 to\r\n850 quintals are collected and exported to Basle, Zürich, Aarau and\r\nVaud. The pitch is worth _in loco_ (1868) 100 to 110 francs (£4 to £4\r\n8_s._) the _bosse_ of 6 quintals. The quantities collected in other\r\nparts of Switzerland are even less considerable.\r\n\r\n[2304] _Hist. des Drogues_, Paris, 1694. part i. 287.\r\n\r\n[2305] Chabræus in his _Stirpium Sciagraphia_ (1666) remarks that he\r\nhad seen the _Pesse_ (_P. Abies_ L.) in great plenty “_in Burgundicis\r\nmontibus_,” yet makes no particular allusion to its yielding resin.\r\n\r\n[2306] _Pharm. Journ._ ix. (1876) 164; also in Hanbury’s _Science\r\nPapers_, pp. 46 to 53.\r\n\r\n[2307] _Oesterreichischer Ausstellungs-Bericht_, x. (Wien, 1868) 471.\r\n\r\n[2308] I spent several days in the localities in 1873.—F. A. F.\r\n\r\n[2309] _Traité des Arbres_, etc. i. (1775) 12.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Pure Burgundy pitch, of which we have numerous authentic\r\nspecimens, is a rather opaque, yellowish-brown substance, hard and\r\nbrittle when cold, yet gradually taking the form of the vessel in which\r\nit is kept. It is strongly adhesive, breaks with a clear conchoidal\r\nfracture, and has a very agreeable, aromatic odour, especially when\r\nheated. It does not exhibit a crystalline structure, although, as\r\nwe have frequently observed, the resin on the stem of the tree is\r\ndistinctly crystalline.\r\n\r\nBurgundy pitch is readily soluble in glacial acetic acid, acetone,\r\nabsolute alcohol, and even in alcohol of 75 per cent. (sp. gr. 0·860),\r\nyet its solubility in these liquids is considerably altered by the\r\npresence of water or essential oil; and still more by the formation of\r\nabietic acid in the resin itself. The same influences also affect the\r\nmelting point.\r\n\r\nThe crude resin of _Pinus Abies_,[2310] deprived of essential oil and\r\ndissolved in one part of absolute alcohol, was found to deviate a ray\r\nof polarized light 3° to the left, in a column of 50 mm.; the essential\r\noil deviated 8·5° to the same direction. The oil contains a small\r\namount of an oxygenated oil. After treatment with sodium the oil which\r\nremains does not form a solid compound if saturated with hydrochloric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n[2310] Collected by myself.—F. A. F.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The investigations of Maly mentioned at p. 607\r\nafford a satisfactory elucidation of the chemical properties of the\r\npinic resinous exudations. They all, according to that chemist, are\r\nmixtures of the same amorphous resin, C₄₄H₆₂O₄, with essential oils of\r\nthe composition C₁₀H₁₆. These terebinthinous juices are collected and\r\nsold either in their natural state as _turpentine_, or deprived more\r\nor less completely of their volatile oil, in which condition they are\r\nrepresented by _Burgundy Pitch_, and finally by _rosin_ or _colophony_.\r\n\r\nThe turpentines flowing down the stems of the trees gradually lose\r\ntheir transparency if allowed to dry slowly in the air, becoming at\r\nthe same time harder and somewhat granular. This alteration is due\r\nto the incorporation of water, which at last is not only mixed with\r\nthe components of the resinous juice, but to some extent combines\r\nchemically with the resin so as to transform it into a crystalline body\r\nhaving the characters of an acid. The fact is easily observed if clear\r\ndrops of the turpentine of _Pinus silvestris_, _P. Abies_ or _P. Picea_\r\nare collected in vials and kept perfectly dry. Thus treated these\r\nturpentines remain transparent, but the addition of water causes after\r\na short time the formation of microscopic crystals of abietic acid,\r\nrendering them more or less opaque.\r\n\r\nIf turpentines are collected before they lose their essential oil by\r\nevaporation and oxidation, and before they have become crystalline,\r\nthey can be retained perfectly transparent by distilling off the\r\nvolatile oil without water. The distillation being most commonly\r\ncarried on _with water_, the remaining resin is opaque.\r\n\r\nMaly is of opinion that the same amorphous resin occurs in all the\r\n_Coniferæ_, and that it yields by hydration the same acid, namely\r\n_Abietic_, which has been described by former chemists as _Pinic_,\r\n_Silvic_, and _Pimaric_ acids, all of which indeed are admitted to\r\nhave the same composition. We must however remember that several sorts\r\nof turpentine, as Canada Balsam, appear incapable, according to our\r\nexperiments, of yielding any crystalline resinoid compound whatever;\r\nand that their amorphous resin being but partially soluble is certainly\r\nnot a homogeneous substance.\r\n\r\nThe crystals as formed naturally in the common turpentines do not\r\nexhibit precisely the same forms as those obtained artificially\r\nwhen the resins are agitated with warm diluted alcohol, as in the\r\npreparation of abietic acid. As to _Pimaric Acid_, we have prepared it\r\nin quantity from _galipot_, the resin of _Pinus Pinaster_, but have\r\nalways found its crystalline character entirely different from that of\r\nabietic acid.[2311]\r\n\r\n[2311] _Jahresbericht_ of Wiggers and Husemann for 1867. 37.\r\n\r\nWe are inclined, therefore, to think that the composition of the resins\r\nof _Coniferæ_ is not so uniform as Maly suggests. The remarkable\r\nvariety of their essential oils is a fact which seems in favour of our\r\nview.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Burgundy pitch is prescribed as an ingredient of plasters, and\r\nthus employed is useful as a mild stimulant. In Germany it has some\r\neconomic applications, one of which is the lining of beer casks, for\r\nwhich purpose a composition is used called _Brauerpech_ (brewers’\r\npitch), made by mixing it with colophony or _galipot_.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—No drug is the subject of more adulteration than\r\nBurgundy pitch, so much so that the very name is understood by some\r\npharmacologists to be that of a manufactured compound. The substance\r\ncommonly sold in England is made by melting together colophony\r\nwith palm oil or some other fat, water being stirred in to render\r\nthe mixture opaque. In appearance it is very variable, different\r\nsamples presenting different shades of bright or dull yellow or\r\nyellowish-brown. Many when broken exhibit numerous cavities containing\r\nair or water; all are more or less opaque, becoming in time transparent\r\non the surface by the loss of water. Artificial Burgundy pitch is\r\noffered for sale in bladders; it has a weak terebinthinous odour, and\r\nis devoid of the peculiar fragrance of the genuine. The presence of a\r\nfatty oil is easily discovered by treatment with double its weight of\r\nglacial acetic acid, which forms a turbid mixture, separating by repose\r\ninto two layers, the upper being oily.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIX LIQUIDA.\r\n\r\n_Wood-Tar_; F. _Goudron végétal_, _Poix liquide_; G. _Holztheer_,\r\n_Fichtentheer_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—Tar is obtained by submitting the wood of the stems\r\nand roots of coniferous trees to dry or destructive distillation. That\r\nfound in commerce is produced in Northern Europe, chiefly from two\r\nspecies, namely _Pinus silvestris_ L. and _P. Ledebourii_ Endl. (_Larix\r\nsibirica_ Ledeb.). These trees constitute the vast forests of Arctic\r\nEurope and Asia.\r\n\r\n=History=—Theophrastus gives a circumstantial description of the\r\npreparation of tar, which applies with considerable accuracy to the\r\nprocesses still practised in those districts where no improved methods\r\nof manufacture have yet been introduced.\r\n\r\n=Production=—The great bulk of the vegetable tar used in Europe, and\r\nknown in commerce as _Archangel_ or _Stockholm Tar_, is prepared in\r\nFinland, Central and Northern Russia, and Sweden.\r\n\r\nThe process is conducted in the following manner:—vast stacks of\r\npine wood consisting chiefly of the roots and lower portions of the\r\ntrunks (the more valuable parts of the trees being used as timber),\r\nand containing as much as 30,000 to 70,000 cubic feet, are carefully\r\npacked together, and then covered with a thick layer of turf, moss, and\r\nearth, beaten down with heavy stampers. The whole stack of billets is\r\nconstructed over a conical or funnel-like cavity made in the ground,\r\nif possible on the side of a hill, this arrangement being adopted for\r\nthe purpose of carrying on a downward distillation. Fire being applied\r\nthe combustion of the mass of wood has to be carried on very slowly and\r\nwithout flame in order to obtain the due amount of tar and a charcoal\r\nof good quality. During its progress the products, chiefly tar, collect\r\nin the funnel-like cavity, from which they are discharged by a tube\r\ninto a cast-iron pan placed beneath the stack, or simply into hollow\r\ntree trunks. The time required for combustion varies from one to four\r\nweeks, according to the size of the stack.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years this rude process has been improved and\r\naccelerated by the introduction of rationally constructed wrought-iron\r\nstills, furnished with refrigerating condensers, as proposed in Russia\r\nby Hessel in 1861. By this mode of manufacture the yield in tar of\r\npine wood is about 14 per cent. from stems, dried by exposure to the\r\nopen air; and 16 to 20 per cent. from roots. Large quantities of\r\npyroligneous acid and oil of turpentine are at the same time secured.\r\nThe wood of the beech and of other non-coniferous trees appears not to\r\nafford more than 10 per cent. of tar, while turf yields only from 3 to\r\n9 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The numerous empyreumatic products which result from\r\nthe destructive distillation of pine wood, and which we call tar,\r\nconstitute a dark brown or blackish semi-liquid substance, of peculiar\r\nodour and sharp taste. When deprived of water and seen in thin layers,\r\ntar is perfectly transparent. The magnifying glass shows some of the\r\nvarieties to contain colourless crystals of _Pyrocatechin_, scattered\r\nthroughout the dark viscid substance, and to these tar owes its\r\noccasionally granular, honey-like consistence.[2312] A gentle heat\r\ncauses them to melt and mix with the other constituents.\r\n\r\n[2312] _Jahresbericht_ of Wiggers and Husemann for 1867. 37.\r\n\r\nTrue vegetable tar has always a decidedly acid reaction. It is readily\r\nmiscible with alcohol, glacial acetic acid, ether, fixed and volatile\r\noils, chloroform, benzol, amylic alcohol or acetone. It is soluble in\r\ncaustic alkaline solutions, but not in pure water or watery liquids.\r\nThe sp. gr. of tar from the roots of conifers is about 1·06 (Hessel)\r\nyet at a somewhat elevated temperature, it becomes lighter than warm\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWater agitated with tar acquires a light yellowish tint, and the taste\r\nand odour of tar, as well as an acid reaction. On evaporation the\r\nsolution becomes brown, and at last microscopic crystals are obtained\r\nwith a brown residue like tar itself, which is no longer soluble in\r\nwater. A microscopical examination of tar which has been exhausted with\r\nwater, shows that all crystals have disappeared.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Dry wood may be heated to about 150° C. without\r\ndecomposition; but at a more elevated temperature, it commences to\r\nundergo a change, yielding a large number of products, the nature and\r\ncomparative quantity of which depend upon circumstances. If the process\r\nis carried on in a closed vessel, a residue will be got which has more\r\nor less resemblance to coal. By heating fir-wood enclosed with some\r\nwater to 400° C., Daubrée (1857) obtained a coal-like substance, which\r\nyielded by a subsequent increase of temperature scarcely any volatile\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nThe results are widely different if a process is followed which permits\r\nthe formation of volatile bodies; and these substances are formed in\r\nlargest proportion, if the heat acts quickly and intensely. At lower\r\ndegrees of heat, more charcoal results and more water is evolved.\r\n\r\nAmong the volatile products of destructive distillation, those alone\r\nwhich are condensed at the ordinary temperature of the air are of\r\npharmaceutical interest; and of these, chiefly the portion not soluble\r\nin water, or that which is called _Tar_ or _Liquid Pitch_. The aqueous\r\nportion of the products consist principally of empyreumatic acetic\r\nacid, to which tar owes its acid reaction.\r\n\r\nThe tissue of wood is chiefly formed of cellulose, intimately combined\r\nwith a saccharine substance, which may be separated if the wood is\r\nboiled with dilute acids. The remaining cellulose is however not\r\nyet pure, but is still united to a substance which, as shown by\r\nErdmann,[2313] is capable of yielding pyrocatechin.\r\n\r\n[2313] Liebig, _Annalen der Chemie u. Pharmacie_, Suppl. v. (1867) 229.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that sugar subjected to an elevated temperature,\r\nyields a series of pyrogenous products; and the same fact is observed\r\nif purified cellulose is heated in similar manner. But for tar-making,\r\nwood is preferred which is impregnated with resins and essential oils,\r\nand these latter furnish another series of empyreumatic products.\r\nFrom these circumstances, the components of wood-tar are of an\r\nextremely complicated character, which is still more the case when\r\nother woods than those of conifers form part of the material submitted\r\nto distillation. In the case of beech-wood, _Creasote_ is formed,\r\nwhich is obtained only in very small quantity from the _Coniferæ_.\r\nVolatile alkaloids and carbolic acid, which are largely produced in the\r\ndestructive distillation of coal, appear not to be present in wood-tar.\r\n\r\nThe components of the latter may be considered under two heads:—first,\r\nthe _lighter aqueous portion_, which separates from the other products\r\nof distillation, forming what is called _Impure Pyroligneous Acid_.\r\nThis contains chiefly acetic acid and _Methyl Alcohol_ or _Wood\r\nNaphtha_, CH₄O; _Acetone_, C₃H₆O; besides other liquid products\r\nabundantly soluble in water and acetic acid. In this portion, some\r\npyrocatechin also occurs.\r\n\r\nThe second class of pyrogenous products of wood consists of a\r\nhomologous series of liquid hydrocarbons, sparingly soluble in water,\r\nand which therefore are chiefly retained in the heavy layer below the\r\npyroligneous acid, forming the proper wood-tar. The liquid in question\r\nfurnishes _Toluol_ or _Toluene_, C₇H₈ (boiling point 114° C.), _Xylole_\r\nC₈H₁₀, and several other analogous substances.\r\n\r\nIf tar is redistilled, an elevated temperature being used towards the\r\nend of the process, some crystallizable solid bodies are obtained, the\r\nmost important of which is that called _Paraffin_, having the formula\r\nCₙH₍₂ₙ₊₂₎, _n_ varying from 20 to 24.\r\n\r\nThe crystals already mentioned as occurring in tar are _Pyrocatechin_.\r\nThey are easily sublimed at some degrees above their fusing point (104°\r\nC.), or removed by acetic acid, in which as well as in water they are\r\nreadily soluble. Hence in some sorts of tar this substance does not\r\noccur, it having probably been removed by water.\r\n\r\nPyrocatechin, C₆H₄(OH)₂, can be obtained by the destructive\r\ndistillation of many other substances, as catechu, kino, the extracts\r\nof rhatany and bearberry leaves, and other extracts rich in that form\r\nof tannin which produces _greenish_ (not _blue-black_) precipitates in\r\nsalts of iron. It is extracted from the granular sorts of wood-tar,\r\nby exposing them at a proper temperature to a current of heated dry\r\nair, or by exhausting them with water. Ether when shaken with the\r\nconcentrated aqueous solution and left to evaporate, leaves colourless\r\ncrystals of pyrocatechin which after purification are devoid of acid\r\nreaction. They have a peculiar burning persistent taste, and are\r\nvery pungent and irritating when allowed to evaporate. A solution of\r\npyrocatechin yields with perchloride of iron a dark green coloration\r\nchanging to black after a few moments, and becoming red on the addition\r\nof potash. This mixture finally acquires a magnificent violet hue, like\r\na solution of alkaline permanganate. No alteration is produced in a\r\nsolution of pyrocatechin by protosalts of iron.\r\n\r\nAmong the few medicinal preparations of tar, is _Tar Water_, called\r\n_Aqua vel Liquor Picis_, made by agitating wood-tar with water. The\r\npresence in it of pyrocatechin is easily proved by the above-mentioned\r\nreactions, or by a few drops of red chromate of potassium, which\r\nproduces a brownish black colouration. It may hence be inferred that\r\npyrocatechin is perhaps the active ingredient in tar-water, and that\r\nfor making this liquid the granular, crystalline sorts of tar should be\r\npreferred.[2314]\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Tar as well as pitch is manufactured in Finland, and shipped\r\nfrom various ports in the Gulf of Bothnia, as Uleaborg, Gamla Carleby,\r\nJacobstad, Ny Carleby and Christinestad; also from Archangel and Onega\r\non the White Sea. Some tar is also produced in Volhynia, and finds its\r\nway by the Dnieper to the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nThe North of Sweden likewise produces tar, chiefly about Umea and\r\nLulea, the distillation being now performed in well-constructed\r\napparatus of iron.\r\n\r\nThe pine forests of North America afford tar and pitch. Wilmington\r\nin North Carolina exported in 1871, 25,260 barrels of tar, and 3788\r\nbarrels of pitch.[2315]\r\n\r\n[2314] We may suppose that the authors of the French _Codex_ were not\r\nof this opinion, inasmuch as in making _Eau de Goudron_, they order\r\nthat the liquid obtained by the first maceration of the tar, shall be\r\nthrown away.\r\n\r\n[2315] Consul Walker, _Report on the Trade of North and South\r\nCarolina—Consular Reports_ presented to Parliament, May, 1872.\r\n\r\nThe imports of tar into the United Kingdom in 1872, were 189,291\r\nbarrels, valued at £218,339. Of this quantity 145,483 barrels were\r\nshipped from the northern ports of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe barrels in which tar arrives hold about 30 gallons. Smaller sized\r\nvessels termed _half-barrels_ are also used, though less frequently.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—In medicine of no great importance: an ointment of tar is\r\na common remedy in cutaneous diseases, and tar water is sometimes\r\ntaken internally. The consumption of tar in shipbuilding and for the\r\npreservation of fences, sufficiently explains the large importations.\r\n\r\nOther Varieties of Tar.\r\n\r\n_Juniper Tar_, _Pyroleum Oxycedri_, _Oleum Juniperi empyreumaticum_,\r\n_Oleum Cadinum_, _Huile de Cade_.—This is a tar originally obtained\r\nby the destructive distillation of the wood of the _Cade_, _Juniperus\r\nOxycedrus_ L., a shrub or small tree, native of the countries bordering\r\nthe Mediterranean. It was for centuries used in the South of France as\r\nan external remedy, chiefly for domestic animals, but had fallen into\r\ncomplete oblivion until ten years ago, when it began to be prescribed\r\nin skin complaints.\r\n\r\nThe _Huile de Cade_ now in use, is transparent and devoid of crystals.\r\nIt is somewhat thinner than Swedish tar, but closely agrees with it in\r\nother respects. It is imported from the Continent, but where made and\r\nfrom what wood we know not. _Huile de Cade_ is mentioned by Olivier de\r\nSerres,[2316] a celebrated French writer on agriculture of the 16th\r\ncentury; it is named by Parkinson[2317] in 1640; also by Pomet,[2318]\r\nin whose time (1694) it was rarely genuine, common tar being sold in\r\nits place.\r\n\r\n[2316] _Théâtre d’Agriculture_, Paris, 1600. 941.\r\n\r\n[2317] _Theatrum Botanicum_, 1033.\r\n\r\n[2318] _Hist. des Drogues_, Paris, 1694. part i. chap. xii. xiv.\r\n\r\n_Beech Tar_—Tar is also manufactured from the wood of the beech, _Fagus\r\nsilvatica_ L., and has a place in some pharmacopœias as the best source\r\nof creasote.\r\n\r\n_Birch Tar_—is made to a small extent in Russia, where it is called\r\n_Dagget_, from the wood of _Betula alba_ L. It contains an abundance\r\nof pyrocatechin, and is esteemed on account of its peculiar odour well\r\nknown in the Russia leather. A purified oil of birch tar is sold by the\r\nLeipzig distillers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIX NIGRA.\r\n\r\n_Pix sicca vel solida vel navalis_; _Pitch_, _Black Pitch_; F. _Poix\r\nnoire_; G. _Schiffspech_, _Schusterpech_, _Schwarzes Pech_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—see _Pix liquida_.\r\n\r\n=Production=—When the crude products of the dry distillation of\r\npine wood, as described in the previous article, are submitted to\r\nre-distillation, the following results are obtained. The first 10 to\r\n15 per cent. of volatile matter consists chiefly of methylic alcohol\r\nand acetone. A higher temperature causes the vaporization of the\r\nacetic acid, while the still retains the tar. This last, subjected\r\nto a further distillation, may be separated into a liquid portion\r\ncalled _Oil of Tar_ (_Oleum Picis liquidæ_), and a residuum which,\r\non cooling, hardens and forms the product under notice, namely _Black\r\nPitch_. Again heated to a very elevated temperature, it is capable of\r\nyielding paraffin, anthracene and naphthalene.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Pitch is an opaque-looking, black substance, breaking\r\nwith a shining conchoidal fracture, the fragments showing at the\r\nthin translucent edges a brownish colour. No trace of distinct\r\ncrystallization is observable when very thin fragments are examined,\r\neven by polarized light. Pitch has a peculiar disagreeable odour,\r\nrather different from that of tar. Its alcoholic solution has a feeble\r\ntaste somewhat like that of tar, but pitch itself when masticated is\r\nalmost tasteless. It softens by the warmth of the hand, and may then\r\nbe kneaded. It readily dissolves in those liquids which are solvents\r\nof tar. Alcohol of 75 per cent. acts freely on it, leaving behind in\r\nsmall proportion a dark viscid residue. The brown solution reddens\r\nlitmus paper, and yields a dingy brownish precipitate with perchloride\r\nof iron, and whitish precipitates with alcoholic solution of neutral\r\nacetate of lead, or with pure water. Pitch dissolves in solution of\r\ncaustic potash, evolving an offensive odour.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—From the method in which pitch is prepared,\r\nwe may infer that it contains some of the less volatile and less\r\ncrystallizable compounds found in tar. Ekstrand (1875) extracted from\r\nit _Retene_, C₁₈H₁₈, a colourless, inodorous crystalline substance,\r\nmelting at 90° C.\r\n\r\nThe pitch of beech-wood boiled with a caustic alkali, yields a fœtid\r\nvolatile oil; when this solution is acidulated, fatty volatile acids\r\nare evolved. These principles however have not yet been isolated either\r\nfrom the pitch of pine or beech. The whitish compound formed by acetate\r\nof lead in an alcoholic solution of pitch deserves investigation, and\r\nperhaps might be the starting point for acquiring a better knowledge of\r\nthe chemistry of this substance.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The same countries that produce tar produce also pitch. The\r\nquantity of the latter imported into the United Kingdom during 1872 was\r\n35,482 cwt., four-fifths of which were supplied by Russia. Pitch is\r\nalso manufactured from tar in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Pitch is occasionally administered in the form of pills, or\r\nexternally as an ointment; but its medicinal properties are, to say the\r\nleast, very questionable.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS JUNIPERI.\r\n\r\n_Baccæ Galbuli Juniperi_; _Juniper Berries_; F. _Baies de Genièvre_; G.\r\n_Wacholderbeeren_, _Kaddigbeeren_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Juniperis communis_ L., a diœcious evergreen,\r\noccurring in Europe from the Mediterranean to the Arctic regions,\r\nthroughout Russian Asia as far as Sachalin, and in the north-western\r\nHimalaya, where it is ascending in Kashmir at 5400 feet, in Lahoul to\r\n12,500, on the upper Biās and in Gurhwal to 14,000 feet. It abounds\r\nin the islands of Newfoundland, Saint Pierre, and Miquelon, and is\r\nalso found in Continental North America. Dispersed over this vast area\r\nthe Common Juniper presents several varieties. In England and in the\r\ngreater part of Europe it forms a bushy shrub from 2 to 6 feet high,\r\nbut in the interior of Norway and Sweden it becomes a small forest tree\r\nof 30 to 36 feet, often attaining an age of hundreds of years.[2319] In\r\nhigh mountain regions of temperate Europe and in Arctic countries it\r\nassumes a decumbent habit (_Juniperus nana_ Willd.), rising only a few\r\ninches above the soil.\r\n\r\n=History=—The fruits of Juniper, though by no means exclusively those\r\nof _J. communis_, were commonly used in medicine by the Greek and Roman\r\nas well as by the Arabian physicians; they had a place among the drugs\r\nof the Welsh “physicians of Myddvai” (see Appendix), and are mentioned\r\nin some of the earliest printed herbals. The oil was distilled by\r\nSchnellenberg[2320] as early as 1546.\r\n\r\nPopular uses were formerly assigned in various parts of Europe to\r\nJuniper berries. They were employed as a spice to food;[2321] and a\r\nspirit, of which wormwood was an ingredient, was obtained from them by\r\nfermentation and distillation. The spirit called in French _Genièvre_\r\nbecame known in English as _Geneva_, a name subsequently contracted\r\ninto _Gin_.[2322]\r\n\r\n[2319] Schübeler, _Culturpflanzen Norwegens_, Christiania, 1873-1875.\r\n140, with fig.\r\n\r\n[2320] _Artsneybuch_, Königsberg, 1556. 35.\r\n\r\n[2321] Valmont de Bomare, _Dict. d’Hist. nat._ ii. (1775) 45.\r\n\r\n[2322] The gin distilled in Holland is flavoured with Juniper berries,\r\nyet, as we are told, but very slightly, only 2 lb. being used to 100\r\ngallons.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The flowers form minute axillary catkins; those of the\r\nfemale plant consist of 3 to 5 whorls of imbricated bracts. Of these\r\nthe uppermost three soon become fleshy and scale-like, and alternate\r\nwith three upright ovules having an open pore at the apex. After the\r\nflowers have faded these three fleshy bracts grow together to form a\r\nberry-like fruit termed a _galbulus_, which encloses three seeds. The\r\nthree points and sutures of the fruit-scales are conspicuous in the\r\nupper part of the young fruit; but after maturity the sutures alone\r\nare visible, forming a depressed mark at its summit. A small point,\r\nsurrounded by two or three trios of minute bracts, indicates the base\r\nof the fruit.\r\n\r\nThis fruit or pseudo-berry remains ovate and green during its first\r\nyear, and it is not until the second autumn that it becomes ripe. It is\r\nthen spherical, ³/₁₀ to ⁴/₁₀ of an inch in diameter, of a deep purplish\r\ncolour, with a blue-grey bloom. Its internal structure may be thus\r\ndescribed:—beneath the thin epicarp there is a loose yellowish-brown\r\nsarcocarp, enclosing large cavities, the oil-ducts; the three hard\r\nseeds lying close together, triangular and sharp-edged at the top, are\r\nattached to the sarcocarp at their outer sides, and only as far as\r\nthe lower half. The upper half, which is free, is covered by a thin\r\nmembrane. In the longitudinal furrows of the hard testa towards the\r\nlower half of the seed are small prominent sacs growing out into the\r\nsarcocarp. Each seed bears on its inner side 1 or 2, and on its convex\r\nouter surface 4 to 8 of these sacs, which in old fruits contain the\r\nresinified oil in an amorphous colourless state.\r\n\r\nJuniper berries when crushed have an aromatic odour, and a spicy,\r\nsweetish, terebinthinous taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The outer layer of the fruit consists of a\r\ncolourless transparent cuticle, which covers a few rows of large cubic\r\nor tabular cells having thick, brown, porous walls. These cells contain\r\na dark granular substance and masses of resin. The sarcocarp, which\r\nin the ripe state consists of large, elliptic, thin-walled, loosely\r\ncoherent cells, contains chlorophyll, drops of essential oil, and a\r\ncrystalline substance soluble in alcohol,—no doubt a stearoptene.\r\nBefore maturity it likewise contains starch granules and large\r\noil-cells. This tissue is traversed by very small vascular bundles\r\ncontaining annulated and dotted vessels.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most important constituent of juniper\r\nberries is the volatile oil, obtainable to the extent of 0·4 to 1·2 per\r\ncent. The latter amount is obtained from Hungarian, 0·7 per cent. from\r\nGerman fruits.[2323] It is a mixture of levogyre oils, the one of which\r\nhaving the composition C₁₀H₁₆ boils at 155° C.; the prevailing portion\r\nof the oil, boiling at about 200°, consists of hydrocarbons, which\r\nare polymeric with terpene, C₁₀H₁₆. The crude oil as distilled by us\r\ndeviated 3°·5 to the left in a column of 50 mm.\r\n\r\n[2323] According to Messrs. Schimmel & Co. (see p. 306, note 2.)\r\n\r\nBy passing nitrosyl chloride gas, NOCl, into it, Tilden (1877)\r\nobtained from the portion boiling below 160° the crystallized compound\r\nC₁₀H₁₆(NOCl), which is yielded by all the terpenes.\r\n\r\nAnother important constituent of juniper berries is the glucose, of\r\nwhich Trommsdorff (1822) obtained 33 per cent., while Donath (1873)\r\nfound 41·9, and Ritthausen (1877) not more than 16 per cent. in the\r\nberries deprived of water. Of albuminoid substances about 5 per cent.\r\nare present, of inorganic matters 3 to 4 per cent. The fruit, moreover,\r\ncontains also according to Donath small amounts of formic, acetic, and\r\nmalic acids, besides resin.\r\n\r\n=Collection and Commerce=—Juniper berries are largely collected in\r\nSavoy, and in the departments of the Doubs and Jura in France, whence\r\nthey find their way to the hands of the Geneva druggists. They are\r\nalso gathered in Austria, the South of France and Italy. In Hamburg\r\nprice-currents they are quoted as _German_ and _Italian_. The largest\r\nsupplies are apparently furnished by Hungaria.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The berries and the essential oil obtained from them are reputed\r\ndiuretic, yet are not often prescribed in English medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBA SABINÆ.\r\n\r\n_Cacumina vel Summitates Sabinæ_; _Savin or Savine_; F. _Sabine_; G.\r\n_Sevenkraut_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Juniperus Sabina_ L., a woody evergreen shrub,\r\nusually of small size and low-growing, spreading habit, but in some\r\nlocalities erect and arborescent.\r\n\r\nIt occurs in the Southern Alps of Austria (Tirol) and Switzerland (Visp\r\nor Viège and Stalden in the Valais, also in Grisons and Vaud), and in\r\nthe adjacent mountains of France and Piedmont, ascending to elevations\r\nof 4,000 to 5,000 feet. It is also found in the Pyrenees, Central\r\nSpain, Italy and the Crimea; likewise in the Caucasus, where it reaches\r\n12,000 feet above the sea-level. Eastward it extends to the Elburs\r\nrange, south of the Caspian, and throughout Southern Siberia, where it\r\nascends in the Balkhasch and Alatau mountains to 8,600 feet. In North\r\nAmerica it has been gathered on the banks of the river Saskatchewan, at\r\nLake Huron, in Newfoundland, and in Saint Pierre and Miquelon. There\r\nare, however, a few very closely allied species which may occasionally\r\nhave been confounded with savin.\r\n\r\n=History=—Savin is mentioned as a veterinary drug by Marcus Porcius\r\nCato,[2324] a Roman writer on husbandry who flourished in the second\r\ncentury B.C.; and it was well known to Dioscorides (under the name of\r\nβρἀθυ) and Pliny. The plant, which is frequently named in the early\r\nEnglish leech-books written before the Norman Conquest,[2325] may\r\nprobably have been introduced into Britain by the Romans. Charlemagne,\r\nA.D. 812, ordered that it should be cultivated on the imperial farms of\r\nCentral Europe. Its virtues as a stimulating application to wounds and\r\nulcers are noticed in the verses of Macer Floridus,[2326] composed in\r\nthe 10th century.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The medicinal part of savin is the young and tender green\r\nshoots, stripped from the more woody twigs and branches. These are\r\nclothed with minute scale-like rhomboid leaves, arranged alternately in\r\nopposite pairs. On the younger twigs they are closely adpressed, thick,\r\nconcave, rounded on the back, in the middle of which is a conspicuous\r\ndepressed oil gland. As the shoots grow older the leaves become more\r\npointed and divergent from the stem. Savin evolves, when rubbed or\r\nbruised, a strong and not disagreeable odour. The blackish fruit or\r\n_galbulus_ resembling a small berry, ²/₁₀ of an inch in diameter,\r\ngrows on a short recurved stalk, and is covered with a blue bloom. It\r\nis globular, dry, but abounding in essential oil, and contains 1 to 4\r\nlittle bony nuts.\r\n\r\nTo mycologists, _Juniperus Sabina_, at least in the cultivated state,\r\nis interesting on account of the parasitic fungus _Podisoma fuscum_\r\nDuby, the mycelium of which produces, on the leaves of the pear-trees,\r\nthe so-called _Roestelia cancellata_ Rebentisch.\r\n\r\n=Chemistry=—The odour of savin is due to an essential oil, of which\r\nthe fresh tops afford 2 to 4 per cent., and the berries about 10 per\r\ncent. Examined in a column 50 millimetres long it was found to deviate\r\nthe ray of polarized light 27° to the right, the oil used having been\r\ndistilled by one of us in London from the fresh plant cultivated at\r\nMitcham. The same result was obtained from the oil abstracted ten years\r\npreviously from savin collected wild on the Alps of the Canton de Vaud,\r\nSwitzerland. We find that, by the prolonged action of the air, if\r\nthe oil is kept in a vessel not carefully closed, the rotatory power\r\nafter the lapse of years is greatly reduced. Savin oil, according to\r\nTilden (1877), yields a small amount of an oil boiling at 160°, which\r\nanswers to the formula C₁₀H₁₆O. The greater part of the oil was found\r\nby that chemist to boil above 200° C. Tilden asserts that no terpene is\r\npresent in the oil of savin; we have not been able to obtain from it a\r\ncrystallized hydrochloride. Savin tops contain traces of tannic matter.\r\n\r\n[2324] Cap. lxx. (_Bubus medicamentum_).\r\n\r\n[2325] Cockayne, _Leechdoms, etc., of Early England_, ii. (1865) xii.\r\n\r\n[2326] Choulant, _Macer Floridus de viribus herbarum_, Lipsiæ,\r\n1832. 48.... “Duplum si desunt _cinnama_ poni in medicamentis iubet\r\n_Oribasius_ auctor.”\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Savin is a powerful uterine stimulant, producing in overdoses\r\nvery serious effects. It is but rarely administered internally. An\r\nointment of savin, which from the chlorophyll it contains is of a fine\r\ngreen colour, is used as a stimulating dressing for blisters.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—There are several species of juniper which have a\r\nconsiderable resemblance to savin; and one of them, commonly grown\r\nin gardens and shrubberies, is sometimes mistaken for it. This is\r\n_Juniperus virginiana_ L., the _Red Cedar_ or _Savin_ of North America.\r\nIn its native country it is a tree, attaining a height of 50 feet\r\nor more, but in Britain it is seldom more than a large shrub, of\r\nloose spreading growth, very different from the low, compact habit\r\nof savin.[2327] The foliage is of two sorts, consisting either of\r\nminute, scale-like, rhomboid leaves like those of savin, more rarely\r\nof elongated, sharp, divergent leaves a quarter of an inch in length,\r\nresembling those of common Juniper. Both forms often occur on the\r\nsame branch. The plant is much less rich in essential oil than true\r\nsavin,[2328] for which it is sometimes substituted in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe foliage of _Juniperus phœnicea_ L., a Mediterranean species,\r\nhas some resemblance to savin for which it is said to be sometimes\r\nsubstituted,[2329] but it is quite destitute of the peculiar odour of\r\nthe latter. The specific name of the former alludes to its _red_ fruit,\r\nfrom ϕοινίκιος, purple.\r\n\r\n[2327] We have examined numerous herbarium specimens (wild) of _J.\r\nvirginiana_ and _J. Sabina_, but except difference of stature and\r\nhabit, can observe scarcely any characters for separating them as\r\nspecies. The fruit-stalk in _J. virginiana_ is often pendulous as in\r\n_J. Sabina_. Each plant has two forms,—arboreous and fruticose.\r\n\r\n[2328] This we ascertained by distilling under precisely similar\r\nconditions 6 lbs. 6 oz. of the fresh shoots of each of the two plants,\r\n_Juniperus Sabina_ and _J. virginiana_: the first gave 9 drachms of\r\nessential oil, the second only ½ a drachm. The latter was of a distinct\r\nand more feeble odour, and a different dextrogyre power. In America\r\nthe oil of _J. virginiana_ is known as “_Cedar Oil_,” and used as a\r\ntaenifuge. It contains a crystallizable oxygenated portion. This oil\r\nhowever is afforded by the wood. Red Cedar wood from Florida is stated\r\nby Messrs. Schimmel & Co. (see p. 306) to afford as much as 4 to 5 per\r\ncent. of that oil.\r\n\r\n[2329] _Bonplandia_, x.

It is a native of the tropical parts of America from Mexico\r\nto Brazil, and of the West Indian Islands; and under the slightly\r\ndifferent form known as _M. indica_ Tussac, it occurs in Bengal,\r\nJava and the Philippines. This Asiatic variety is now found in the\r\nWest Indies and Tropical America, but apparently as an introduced\r\nplant.[2331]\r\n\r\n=History=—The history of arrowroot is comparatively recent. Passing\r\nover some early references of French writers on the West Indies to an\r\n_Herbe aux flèches_, which plant it is impossible to identify with\r\n_Maranta_, we find in Sloane’s catalogue of Jamaica plants (1696),\r\n_Canna Indica radice alba alexipharmaca_. This plant, discovered in\r\nDominica, was sent thence to Barbadoes and subsequently to Jamaica,\r\nit being, says Sloane, “_very much esteemed for its alexipharmack\r\nqualities_.” It was observed, he adds, that the native Indians used the\r\nroot of the plant with success against the poison of their arrows, “_by\r\nonly mashing and applying it to the poison’d wounds_”: and further,\r\nthat it cures the poison of the manchineel (_Hippomane Mancinella_ L.),\r\nof the wasps of Guadaloupe, and even stops “_a begun gangreen_.”[2332]\r\n\r\n[2330] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen’s _Med. Plants_, part 23 (1877).\r\n\r\n[2331] We accept the opinion of Körnicke (_Monographiæ Marantaccarum\r\nProdromus, Bull. de la Soc. imp. des Naturalistes de Moscou_, xxxv.\r\n1862, i.) that _Maranta arundinacea_ L. and _M. indica_ Tuss. are one\r\nand the same species. Grisebach maintains them as distinct (_Flora\r\nof the British West Indian Islands_, 1864, 605), allowing both to be\r\nnatives of Tropical America; but he fails to point out any important\r\ncharacter by which they may be distinguished from each other. According\r\nto Miquel (_Linnæa_, xviii. 1844. 71) the plant in the herbarium of\r\nLinnæus labelled _M. arundinacea_, is _M. indica_. We have ourselves\r\nmade arrowroot from the fresh rhizomes of _M. arundinacea_, in order\r\nto compare it with an authentic specimen obtained in Java from _M.\r\nindica_: no difference could be found between them.\r\n\r\n[2332] Sloane, _Catal. plant. quæ in ins. Jamaica sponte proveniunt,\r\nvel vulgò coluntur_, Lond. 1696. 122; also _Hist. of Jamaica_, i.\r\n(1707) 253.\r\n\r\nPatrick Browne (1756) notices the reputed alexipharmic virtues of\r\n_Maranta_, which was then cultivated in many gardens in Jamaica,\r\nand says that the root “_washed, pounded fine and bleached, makes a\r\nfine flour and starch_”—sometimes used as food when provisions are\r\nscarce.[2333]\r\n\r\nHughes, when writing of Barbadoes in 1750, describes arrowroot as a\r\nvery useful plant, the juice mixed with water and drunk being regarded\r\nas “_a preservative against any poison of an hot nature_”; while from\r\nthe root the finest starch is made, far excelling that of wheat.[2334]\r\nThe properties of _Maranta arundinacea_ as a counter-poison are\r\ninsisted upon at some length by Lunan,[2335] who concludes his notice\r\nof the plant by detailing the process for extracting starch from the\r\nrhizome.\r\n\r\nArrowroot came into use in England about the commencement of the\r\npresent century, the supplies being obtained, as it would appear, from\r\nJamaica.[2336]\r\n\r\nThe statements of Sloane, which are confirmed by Browne and Lunan,\r\nplainly indicate the origin and meaning of the word _arrowroot_, and\r\ndisprove the notion of the learned C. F. Ph. von Martius (1867) that\r\nthe name is derived from that of the Arnac or Aroaquis Indians of\r\nSouth America, who call the finest sort of fecula they obtain from\r\nthe Mandioc _Aru-aru_. It is true that _Maranta arundinacea_ is known\r\nat the present day in Brazil as _Araruta_, but the name is certainly\r\na corruption of the English word _arrowroot_, the plant according to\r\ngeneral report having been introduced.[2337]\r\n\r\n=Manufacture=—For the production of arrowroot, the rhizomes are dug up\r\nafter the plant has attained its complete maturity, which in Georgia\r\nis at the beginning of winter. The scales which cover them are removed\r\nand the rhizomes washed; the latter are then ground in a mill, and\r\nthe pulp is washed on sieves, or in washing machines constructed for\r\nthe purpose, in order to remove from it the starch. This is allowed\r\nto settle down in pure water, is then drained and finally dried with\r\na gentle heat. Instead of being crushed in a mill, the rhizomes are\r\nsometimes grated to a pulp by a rasping machine.\r\n\r\nIn all stages of the process for making arrowroot, nice precautions\r\nhave to be taken to avoid contamination with dust, iron mould, insects,\r\nor anything which can impart colour or taste to the product. The\r\nrhizome contains about 68 per cent. of water, and yields about a fifth\r\nof its weight of starch.[2338]\r\n\r\n[2333] _Civil and Natural History of Jamaica_, 1756. 112. 113.\r\n\r\n[2334] _Natural History of Barbados_, 1750. 221.\r\n\r\n[2335] _Hortus Jamaicensis_, i. (1814) 30.\r\n\r\n[2336] Thus in 1799 there were exported from Jamaica 24 casks and boxes\r\nof “_Indian Arrowroot_.”—Renny, _Hist. of Jamaica_, 235.\r\n\r\n[2337] Since the above was written, the following lines bearing on\r\nthis question have been received from Mr. Spruce:—“ ... I know not\r\nMartius’ derivation of ‘_arrowroot_.’ On the Amazon it is called\r\n‘_ararúta_’—plainly a corruption of the English name, and explained\r\nby the fact that it was first cultivated, as I was told, from tubers\r\nobtained in the East Indies.”\r\n\r\n[2338] This was in the German colony of Blumenau in Southern\r\nBrazil—Eberhard, _Arch. der Pharm._ 134 (1868) 257.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Arrowroot is a brilliant white, insipid, inodorous,\r\npowder, more or less aggregated into lumps which seldom exceed a pea in\r\nsize; when pressed it emits a slight crackling sound. It exhibits the\r\ngeneral properties of starch, consisting entirely of granules which are\r\nsubspherical, or broadly and irregularly egg-shaped; when seen in water\r\nthey show a distinct stratification in the form of fine concentric\r\nrings around a small star-like hilum. They have a diameter of 5 to 7\r\nmkm. when observed in the air or under benzol. If the water in which\r\nthey lie be cautiously heated on the object-stage of the microscope,\r\nthe tumefaction of the granules will be found to begin exactly at\r\n70° C. Heated to 100° C. with 20 parts of distilled water, arrowroot\r\nyields a semi-transparent jelly of somewhat earthy taste and smell.\r\nBy hydrochloric acid of sp. gr. 1·06, arrowroot is but imperfectly\r\ndissolved at 40° C.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of all varieties of starch is affected by the\r\nwater which they retain at the ordinary temperature of the air.\r\nArrowroot after prolonged exposure to an atmosphere of average\r\nmoisture, and then kept at 100° C. till its weight was constant, was\r\nfound to have lost 13·3 per cent. of water. On subsequent exposure to\r\nthe air, it regained its former proportion of water.\r\n\r\nWeighed in any liquid which is entirely devoid of action on starch, as\r\npetroleum or benzol, the sp. gr. of arrowroot was found by one of us to\r\nbe 1·504; but 1·565 when the powder had been previously dried at 100° C.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure of Arrowroot and of Starch in general=—The\r\ngranules are built up of layers,—a structure which may be rendered\r\nevident by the gradual action of chloride of calcium, chromic acid, or\r\nan ammoniacal solution of cupric oxide. When one of these liquids in a\r\nproper state of dilution is made to act upon starch, or when for that\r\npurpose a liquid is chosen which does not act upon it energetically,\r\nsuch as diastase, bile, pepsin, or saliva, it is easy to obtain a\r\nresidue, which according to Nägeli, is no longer capable of swelling up\r\nin boiling water, nor is immediately turned blue by iodine, except on\r\nthe addition of sulphuric acid; but which is dissolved by ammoniacal\r\ncupric oxide. These are the essential properties of cellulose; and\r\nthis residue has been regarded as such by Nägeli, while the dissolved\r\nportion has been distinguished as _Granulose_ (Maschke, 1852).\r\n\r\nC. Nägeli in his important monograph on starch[2339] has described the\r\naction of saliva when digested with starch for a day, at a temperature\r\nof 40° to 47° C.; he says that the residue is a skeleton, corresponding\r\nin form to the original grain but somewhat smaller, light, and very\r\nmobile in water. He concludes that its interstitial spaces must have\r\nbeen previously filled with granulose.\r\n\r\nThis experiment, which has been repeated by one of us (F.), does not in\r\nour opinion warrant all the inferences that Nägeli has drawn from it:\r\nit is true that many separate parts of the grain are dissolved by the\r\nsaliva, while others have disappeared down to a mere film, and others\r\nagain have been attacked in a very irregular manner. But we cannot\r\nagree with the statement that anything comparable to a skeleton of\r\nthe grain has been left. After longer action at a higher temperature,\r\nwhich however must not exceed 65° C., a more copious dissolution of the\r\nstarch, either by saliva or by bile, takes place; but in no case is it\r\ncomplete.[2340]\r\n\r\n[2339] _Die Stärkekörner_, Zürich, 1858. 4°, also W. Nägeli,\r\n_Stärkegruppe_, etc., Leipzig, 1874.\r\n\r\n[2340] Further particulars on this question may be found in my paper\r\n_Ueber Stärke und Cellulose—Archiv der Pharmacie_, 196 (1871) 7.—F. A.\r\nF.\r\n\r\n=Chemistry of Starch=—Its composition answers to the formula\r\n(C₆H₁₀O₅)₂+3 OH₂, or when dried at 100° C., C₆H₁₀O₅. Musculus however\r\nshowed, in 1861, that by the action of dilute acids or of _Diastase_,\r\nstarch is resolved into _Dextrin_, C₁₂H₂₀O₁₀, and _Dextrose_, C₆H₁₂O₆,\r\nwith which decomposition, the formula, C₁₈H₃₀O₁₅, would be more\r\nin accord. Sachsse (1877) on the other hand advocates the formula\r\nC₃₀H₆₂O₃₁ + 12 OH₂.\r\n\r\nCold water is not without action on starch; if the latter be\r\ncontinuously triturated with it, the filtrate, in which no particles\r\ncan be detected by the microscope, will assume a blue colour on\r\naddition of iodine, without the formation of a precipitate. The\r\nproportion of starch thus brought into solution is infinitely small,\r\nand always at the expense of the integrity of the grains. It is even\r\nprobable that the solution in this case is due to the minute amount of\r\nheat, which must of necessity be developed by the trituration.\r\n\r\nCertain reagents capable of attacking starch act upon it in very\r\ndifferent ways. The action in the cold of concentrated aqueous\r\nsolutions of easily soluble neutral salts or of chloral hydrate is\r\nremarkable. Potassium bromide or iodide, or calcium chloride for\r\ninstance, cause the grains to swell, and render them soluble in cold\r\nwater. At a certain degree of dilution a perfectly clear liquid is\r\nformed, which at first contains neither dextrin nor sugar; it is\r\ncoloured blue, but is not precipitated by iodine water; and starch can\r\nbe thrown down from it by alcohol. This precipitate, though entirely\r\ndevoid of the structural peculiarity of starch, still exhibits some\r\nof the leading properties of that substance; it is coloured in the\r\nsame manner by iodine, does not dissolve even when fresh in ammoniacal\r\ncupric oxide, and after drying is insoluble in water, whether cold or\r\nboiling. The progress of the solvent is most easily traced when calcium\r\nchloride is used, as this salt acts more slowly than the others we have\r\nmentioned. It leaves scarcely any perceptible residue. This fact in\r\nour opinion militates against the notion that starch is composed of a\r\npeculiar amylaceous substance, deposited within a skeleton of cellulose.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable action of iodine upon starch was discovered in 1814 by\r\nColin and Gaultier de Claubry. It is extremely different in degree,\r\naccording to the peculiar kind of starch, the proportion of iodine, and\r\nthe nature of the substance the grains are impregnated with, before or\r\nafter their treatment with iodine. The action is even entirely arrested\r\n(no blue colour being produced) by the presence in certain proportion\r\nof quinine, tannin, _Aqua Picis_, and of other bodies.\r\n\r\nThe combination of iodine with starch does not take place in equivalent\r\nproportions, and is moreover easily overcome by heat. The iodine\r\ncombined with starch amounts at the utmost to 7·5 per cent. The\r\ncompound is most readily formed in the presence of water, and then\r\nproduces a deep indigo-blue. Almost all other substances capable of\r\npenetrating starch grains, weaken the colour of the iodine compound\r\nto violet, reddish yellow, yellow, or greenish blue. These different\r\nshades, the production of which has been described by Nägeli with great\r\ndiffuseness, are merely the colours which belong to iodine itself in\r\nthe solid, liquid, or gaseous form. They must be referred to the fact\r\nthat the particles of iodine diffuse themselves in a peculiar but\r\nhitherto unexplained manner within the grain or in the swollen and\r\ndissolved starch.\r\n\r\n=Commerce of Arrowroot=—The chief kinds of arrowroot found in commerce\r\nare known as _Bermuda_, _St. Vincent_, and _Natal_; but that of\r\nJamaica and other West India Islands, of Brazil, Sierra Leone, and the\r\nEast Indies, are quoted in price-currents, at least occasionally. Of\r\nthese the Bermuda enjoys the highest reputation and commands by far\r\nthe highest price; but its good quality is shared by the arrowroot\r\nof other localities, from which, when equally pure, it can in nowise\r\nbe distinguished. Greenish,[2341] however, points out that in Natal\r\narrowroot the layers (or laminæ) are more obvious than in other\r\nvarieties, although it appears that the former is also produced by\r\nMaranta.\r\n\r\nThe importations of arrowroot into the United Kingdom during the year\r\n1870 amounted to 21,770 cwt., value £33,063. Of this quantity the\r\nisland of St. Vincent in the West Indies furnished nearly 17,000 cwt.,\r\nand the colony of Natal about 3000 cwt. The exports from St. Vincent\r\nin 1874 were 2,608,100 lb, those of the Bermudas in 1876 only 45,520\r\nlb.[2342] The shipments from the colony of Natal during the years 1866\r\nto 1876 varied from 1,076 cwt. in 1873 to 4,305 cwt. in 1867.[2343]\r\n\r\n[2341] _Yearbook of Pharm._ (1875) 529.\r\n\r\n[2342] Papers relating to H.M.

Abstr. for the several Colonial and other Possessions\r\nof the United Kingdom, 14th number, 1878. p. 60.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Arrowroot boiled with water or milk is a much-valued food in\r\nthe sick-room. It is also an agreeable article of diet in the form of\r\npudding or blancmange.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Other starches than that of _Maranta_ are occasionally\r\nsold under the name of _Arrowroot_. Their recognition is only possible\r\nby the aid of the microscope.\r\n\r\nSubstitutes for Arrowroot.\r\n\r\n_Potato Starch_—This substance, known in trade as _Farina_ or _Potato\r\nFlour_, is made from the tubers of the potato (_Solanum tuberosum_\r\nL.) by a process analogous to that followed in the preparation of\r\narrowroot. It has the following characters:—examined under the\r\nmicroscope, the granules are seen to be chiefly of two sorts, the first\r\nsmall and spherical, the second of much larger size, often 100 mkm. in\r\nlength, having an irregularly circular, oval or egg-shaped outline,\r\nfinely marked with concentric rings round a minute inconspicuous\r\nhilum. When heated in water, the grains swell considerably even at\r\n60° C. Hydrochloric acid, sp. gr. 1·06, dissolves them at 40° quickly\r\nand almost completely, the granules being no longer deposited, as in\r\nthe case of arrowroot similarly treated. The mixture of arrowroot\r\nand hydrochloric acid is inodorous, but that of potato starch has a\r\npeculiar though not powerful odour.\r\n\r\n_Canna Starch, Tous-les-Mois_,[2344] _Toulema, Tolomane_—A species of\r\n_Canna_ is cultivated in the West India Islands, especially St. Kitts,\r\nfor the sake of a peculiar starch which, since about the year 1836,\r\nhas been extracted from its rhizomes by a process similar to that\r\nadopted in making arrowroot. The specific name of the plant is still\r\nundetermined; it is said to agree with _Canna edulis_ Ker (_C. indica_\r\nRuiz et Pavon).[2345]\r\n\r\n[2344] It is commonly stated that the name _Tous-les-mois_ was given\r\nin consequence of the plant flowering _all the year round_. But this\r\nexplanation appears improbable: no such name is mentioned by Rochefort,\r\nAublet, or Descourtilz, who all describe the _Balisier_ or _Canna_. It\r\nseems more likely that the term is the result of an attempt to confer\r\na meaning on an ancient name—perhaps _Touloula_, which is one of the\r\nCarib designations for _Canna_ and _Calathea_.\r\n\r\n[2345] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen’s _Medic. Plants_, part 8 (1876).\r\n\r\nThe starch, which bears the same name as the plant, is a dull white\r\npowder, having a peculiar satiny or lustrous aspect, by reason of the\r\nextraordinary magnitude of the starch granules of which it is composed.\r\nThese granules examined under the microscope are seen to be flattened\r\nand of irregular form, as circular, oval, oblong, or oval-truncate.\r\nThe centre of the numerous concentric rings with which each granule is\r\nmarked, is usually at one end rather than in the centre of a granule.\r\nThe hilum is inconspicuous. The granules though far larger than those\r\nof the potato, are of the same density as the smaller forms of that\r\nstarch, and, like them, float perfectly on chloroform. When heated,\r\nthey begin to burst at 72° C. Dilute hydrochloric acid acts upon them\r\nas it does on arrowroot.\r\n\r\nCanna starch boiled with 20 times its weight of water affords a jelly\r\nless clear and more tenacious than that of arrowroot, yet applicable\r\nto exactly the same purposes. The starch is but little known and not\r\nmuch esteemed in Europe; it was exported in 1876 from St. Kitts to the\r\namount of 51,873 lb, besides 5,300 lb arrowroot starch.[2346]\r\n\r\n_Curcuma Starch, Tikor_—The pendulous, colourless tubers of some\r\nspecies of _Curcuma_, but especially of _C. angustifolia_ Roxb. and\r\n_C. leucorrhiza_ Roxb., have long been utilized in Southern India\r\nfor the preparation of a sort of arrowroot, known by the Hindustani\r\nname of _Tikor_, or _Tikhur_, and sometimes called by Europeans _East\r\nIndian Arrowroot_.[2347] The granules of this substance much resemble\r\nthose of _Maranta_, but they are neither spherical nor egg-shaped.\r\nOn the contrary, they are rather to be described as flat discs, 5 to\r\n7 mkm. thick, of elliptic or ovoid outline, sometimes truncate; many\r\nattain a length of 60 to 70 mkm. They are always beautifully stratified\r\nboth on the face and on the edge. The hilum is generally situated at\r\nthe narrower end. We have observed that when heated in water, the\r\ntumefaction of the grains commences at 72° C.\r\n\r\nCurcuma starch, which in its general properties agrees with common\r\narrowroot, is rather extensively manufactured in Travancore, Cochin and\r\nCanara on the south-western coast of India, but in a very rude manner.\r\nDrury[2348] states that it is a favourite article of diet among the\r\nnatives, and that it is exported from Travancore and Madras; we can\r\nadd that it is not known as a special kind in the English market, and\r\nthat the article we have seen offered in the London drug sales as _East\r\nIndian Arrowroot_ was the starch of _Maranta_.\r\n\r\n[2346] Page 102 of the Reports quoted at p. 633, note 2.\r\n\r\n[2347] Living roots of the plant used for making this arrowroot at\r\nCochin, have been kindly forwarded to us by A. F. Sealy, Esq. of that\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n[2348] _Useful Plants of India_, ed. 2. 1873. 168.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZINGIBERACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHIZOMA ZINGIBERIS.\r\n\r\n_Radix Zingiberis_; _Ginger_; F. _Gingembre_; G. _Ingwer_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Zingiber officinale_ Roscoe (_Amomum Zingiber_\r\nL.), a reed-like plant, with annual leafy stems, 3 to 4 feet high, and\r\nflowers in cone-shaped spikes borne on other stems thrown up from the\r\nrhizome. It is a native of Asia, in the warmer countries of which it\r\nis universally cultivated,[2349] but not known in a wild state. It has\r\nbeen introduced into most tropical countries, and is now found in the\r\nWest Indies, South America, Tropical Western Africa, and Queensland in\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n=History=—Ginger is known in India under the old name of _Sringavera_,\r\nderived possibly from the Greek Ζιγγίβερι. As a spice it was used among\r\nthe Greeks and Romans, who appear to have received it by way of the\r\nRed Sea, inasmuch as they considered it to be a production of Southern\r\nArabia.\r\n\r\nIn the list of imports from the Red Sea into Alexandria, which in\r\nthe second century of our era were there liable to the Roman fiscal\r\nduty (_vectigal_), _Zingiber_ occurs among other Indian spices.[2350]\r\nDuring the middle ages it is frequently mentioned in similar lists, and\r\nevidently constituted an important item in the commercial relations\r\nbetween Europe and the East. Ginger thus appears in the tariff of\r\nduties levied at Acre in Palestine about A.D. 1173;[2351] in that of\r\nBarcelona[2352] in 1221; Marseilles[2353] in 1228; and Paris[2354]\r\nin 1296. The _Tarif des Péages_, or customs tariff, of the Counts of\r\nProvence in the middle of the 13th century, provides for the levying\r\nof duty at the towns of Aix, Digne, Valensole, Tarascon, Avignon,\r\nOrgon, Arles, &c., on various commodities imported from the East.\r\nThese included spices, as pepper, _ginger_, cloves, zedoary, galangal,\r\ncubebs, saffron, canella, cumin, anise; dye-stuffs, such as lac,\r\nindigo, Brazil wood, and especially alum from Castilia and Volcano; and\r\ngroceries, as racalicia (liquorice), sugar and dates.[2355]\r\n\r\nIn England ginger must have been tolerably well known even prior to\r\nthe Norman Conquest, for it is frequently named in the Anglo-Saxon\r\nleech-books of the 11th century, as well as in the Welsh “Physicians\r\nof Myddvai” (see Appendix). During the 13th and 14th centuries it was,\r\nnext to pepper, the commonest of spices, costing on an average nearly\r\n1_s._ 7_d._ per lb., or about the price of a sheep.[2356]\r\n\r\n[2349] The mode of cultivation is described by Buchanan, _Journey from\r\nMadras through Mysore, etc._ ii.

These terms may be explained thus:—_Belledi_ or _Baladi_ is\r\nan Arabic word, which, as applied to ginger, would signify _country_ or\r\n_wild_, i.e. _common ginger_. _Colombino_ refers to Columbum, Kolam or\r\nQuilon, a port in Travancore frequently mentioned in the middle ages.\r\nGinger termed _Micchino_ denotes that the spice had been brought from\r\nor by way of Mecca.[2357]\r\n\r\nGinger preserved in syrup, and sometimes called _Green Ginger_, was\r\nalso imported during the middle ages, and regarded as a delicacy of the\r\nchoicest kind.\r\n\r\nThe plant affording ginger must have been known to Marco Polo (_circa_\r\n1280-90), who speaks of observing it both in China and India. John of\r\nMontecorvino, who visited India about 1292 (see p. 521), describes\r\nginger as a plant like a flag, the root of which can be dug up and\r\ntransported. Nicolo Conti also gave some description of the plant and\r\nof the collection of the root, as witnessed by him in India.[2358]\r\n\r\nThe Venetians received ginger by way of Egypt; yet some of the superior\r\nkinds were conveyed from India overland by the Black Sea, as stated by\r\nMarino Sanudo[2359] about 1306.\r\n\r\nGinger was introduced into America by Francisco de Mendoça, who took it\r\nfrom the East Indies to New Spain.[2360] It was shipped for commercial\r\npurposes from the Island of St. Domingo as early at least as 1585; and\r\nfrom Barbados in 1654.[2361] According to Renny,[2362] 22,053 cwt. were\r\nexported from the West Indies to Spain in 1547.\r\n\r\n[2357] Yule, _Book of Ser Marco Polo_, ii.

(1879) 601.\r\n\r\n[2358] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[2359] Marinus Sanutus, _Liber secretorum fidelium crucis_, Hanoviæ\r\n(1611) 22.\r\n\r\n[2360] Monardes, _Historia de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias\r\noccidentales_, Sevilla, (1574) 99.\r\n\r\n[2361] _Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series_, 1574-1660, Lond.\r\n1860, p. 4; see also pp. 414, 434.\r\n\r\n[2362] Renny, _Hist. of Jamaica_, Lond. 1807. 154.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Ginger is known in two forms, namely the rhizome dried\r\nwith its epidermis, in which case it is called _coated_; or deprived of\r\nepidermis, and then termed _scraped_ or _uncoated_. The pieces, which\r\nare called by the spice-dealers _races_ or _hands_, rarely exceed 4\r\ninches in length, and have a somewhat palmate form, being made up of a\r\nseries of short, laterally compressed, lobe-like shoots or knobs, the\r\nsummit of each of which is marked by a depression indicating the former\r\nattachment of the leafy stem.\r\n\r\nTo produce the _uncoated ginger_, which is that preferred for medicinal\r\nuse, the fresh rhizome is scraped, washed, and then dried in the sun.\r\n\r\nThus prepared, it has a pale buff hue, and a striated, somewhat fibrous\r\nsurface. It breaks easily, exhibiting a short and farinaceous fracture\r\nwith numerous bristle-like fibres. When cut with a knife the younger\r\nor terminal portion of the rhizome appears pale yellow, soft and\r\namylaceous, while the older part is flinty, hard and resinous.\r\n\r\n_Coated ginger_, or that which has been dried without the removal of\r\nthe epidermis, is covered with a wrinkled, striated brown integument,\r\nwhich imparts to it a somewhat coarse and crude appearance, which is\r\nusually remarkably less developed on the flat parts of the rhizome.\r\nInternally, it is usually of a less bright and delicate hue than\r\nginger from which the cortical part has been removed. Much of it indeed\r\nis dark, horny and resinous.\r\n\r\nGinger has an agreeable aromatic odour with a strong pungent taste.\r\n\r\n=Varieties=—Those at present found in the London market are\r\ndistinguished as _Jamaica_, _Cochin_, _Bengal_, and _African_. The\r\nfirst three are _scraped_ gingers; the last named is a _coated_ ginger,\r\nthat is to say, it still retains its epidermis. Jamaica Ginger is the\r\nsort most esteemed; and next to it the Cochin. But of each kind there\r\nare several qualities, presenting considerable variation _inter se_.\r\n\r\nScraped or decorticated ginger is often bleached, either by being\r\nsubjected to the fumes of burning sulphur, or by immersion for a\r\nshort time in solution of chlorinated lime. Much of that seen in the\r\ngrocers’ shops looks as if it had been whitewashed, and in fact is\r\nslightly coated with calcareous matter,—either sulphate or carbonate of\r\ncalcium.[2363]\r\n\r\n[2363] Mr. Garside (_Pharm. Journ._ April 18, 1874) found both. We have\r\nnot observed the carbonate to be used.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—A transverse section of coated ginger exhibits\r\na brown, horny external layer, about one millimètre broad, separated by\r\na fine line from the whitish mealy interior portion, through the tissue\r\nof which numerous vascular bundles and resin-cells are irregularly\r\nscattered. The external tissue consists of a loose outer layer, and an\r\ninner composed of tabular cells: these are followed by peculiar short\r\nprosenchymatous cells, the walls of which are sinuous on transverse\r\nsection and partially thickened, imparting a horny appearance. This\r\ndelicate felted tissue forms the striated surface of _scraped ginger_,\r\nand is the principal seat of the resin and volatile oil, which here\r\nfill large spaces. The large-celled parenchyme which succeeds is loaded\r\nwith starch, and likewise contains numerous masses of resin and drops\r\nof oil. The starch granules are irregularly spherical, attaining at\r\nthe utmost 40 mkm. Certain varieties of ginger, owing to the starch\r\nhaving been rendered gelatinous by scalding, are throughout horny and\r\ntranslucent. The circle of vascular bundles which separates the outer\r\nlayers and the central portion is narrow, and has the structure of the\r\ncorresponding circle or nucleus-sheath in turmeric.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Ginger contains a volatile oil which is the\r\nonly constituent of the drug that has hitherto been investigated. By\r\ndistilling 112 lb. of Jamaica ginger with water in the usual way, we\r\nobtained 4½ ounces of this oil, or about ¼ per cent. It is a pale\r\nyellow liquid of sp. gr. 0·878, having the peculiar odour of ginger,\r\nbut not its pungent taste. It dissolves but sparingly in alcohol\r\n(0·83); and deviates the ray of polarized light 21°.6 to the left, when\r\nexamined in a column 50 mm. long. We learn from kind information given\r\nus (1878) by Messrs. Schimmel & Co. at Leipzig, that they obtain as\r\nmuch as 2·2 per cent. of oil from good ginger.\r\n\r\nThe burning taste of ginger is due to a resin which we have not\r\nexamined, but which well deserves careful analysis. Protocatechuic\r\nacid, which is so commonly afforded by resins (see page 243), is also\r\nproduced by melting the resin of ginger with caustic potash, as shown\r\nin 1877 by Stenhouse and Groves.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Great Britain imported of ginger as follows:—\r\n\r\n      1868          1869        1870          1871          1872\r\n    52,194 cwt.   34,535 cwt.  33,854 cwt.   32,723 cwt.   32,174 cwt.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the imports were 62,164 cwt., valued at £169,252.\r\n\r\nThe drug was received in 1872 thus:—\r\n\r\n    From Egypt                   4,923 cwt.\r\n      ”  Sierra Leone            6,167  ”\r\n      ”  British India          13,310  ”\r\n      ”  British West Indies     7,543  ”\r\n      ”  other countries           231  ”\r\n                                ------\r\n                    Total       32,174\r\n\r\nThe shipments from Jamaica during the years 1866 to 1876 varied from\r\n599,786 lb. in 1872 to 1,728,075 in 1867. In 1876 there were exported\r\n1,603,764 lb., valued at £28,882.[2364]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Ginger is an agreeable aromatic and stomachic, and as such is\r\noften a valuable addition to other medicines. It is much more largely\r\nemployed as a condiment than as a drug.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHIZOMA CURCUMÆ.\r\n\r\n_Radix Curcumæ_;[2365] _Turmeric_; F. _Curcuma_; G. _Gelbwurzel_,\r\n_Kurkuma_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Curcuma longa_[2366] L.—Turmeric is indigenous to\r\nSouthern Asia, and is there largely cultivated both on the continent\r\nand in the islands.\r\n\r\n=History=—Dioscorides mentions an Indian plant as a kind of _Cyperus_\r\n(Κύπειρος) resembling ginger, but having when chewed a yellow colour\r\nand bitter taste: probably turmeric was intended. Garcia de Orta\r\n(1563), as well as Fragoso (1572), describe turmeric as _Crocus\r\nindicus_. A list of drugs sold in the city of Frankfort about the year\r\n1450, names _Curcuma_ along with zedoary and ginger.[2367]\r\n\r\nIn its native countries, it has from remote times been highly esteemed\r\nboth as a condiment and a dye-stuff; in Europe, it has always been less\r\nappreciated than the allied spices of the ginger tribe. In an inventory\r\nof the effects of a Yorkshire tradesman, dated 20th Sept., 1578, we\r\nfind enumerated—“_x. owncis of turmeracke, x d._”[2368]\r\n\r\n[2364] Statist.

The lateral rhizomes are doubtless in a condition to develope\r\nthemselves as independent plants when separated from the parent.\r\nThe central rhizomes formerly known as _Curcuma rotunda_, and the\r\nelongated lateral ones as _Curcuma longa_, were regarded by Linnæus as\r\nthe production of distinct species.\r\n\r\nThe radical tubers of some species of _Curcuma_, as _C. angustifolia_\r\nRoxb., are used for making a sort of arrowroot (p. 637). Sometimes\r\nthey are dried, and constitute the peculiar kind of turmeric which the\r\nChinese call _Yuh-kin_.[2369]\r\n\r\nThe turmeric of commerce consists of the two sorts of rhizome just\r\nmentioned, namely, the _central_ or _round_ and the _lateral_ or\r\n_long_. The former are ovate, pyriform or subspherical, sometimes\r\npointed at the upper end and crowned with the remains of leaves, while\r\nthe sides are beset with those of roots and marked with concentric\r\nridges. The diameter is very variable, but is seldom less than ¾ of\r\nan inch, and is frequently much more. They are often cut and usually\r\nscalded in order to destroy their vitality and facilitate drying.\r\n\r\nThe lateral rhizomes are subcylindrical, attenuated towards either end,\r\ngenerally curved, covered with a rugose skin, and marked more or less\r\nplainly with transverse rings. Sometimes one, two or more short knobs\r\nor shoots grow out on one side. The rhizomes, whether round or long,\r\nare very hard and firm, exhibiting when broken a dull, waxy, resinous\r\nsurface, of an orange or orange-brown hue, more or less brilliant. They\r\nhave a peculiar aromatic odour and taste.\r\n\r\nSeveral varieties of turmeric distinguished by the names of the\r\ncountries or districts in which they are produced, are found in the\r\nEnglish market: but although they present differences which are\r\nsufficiently appreciable to the eye of the experienced dealer, the\r\ncharacters of each sort are scarcely so marked or so constant as to\r\nbe recognizable by mere verbal description. The principal sorts now\r\nin commerce are known as _China_, _Madras_, _Bengal_, _Java_, and\r\n_Cochin_. Of these the first-named is the most esteemed, but it is\r\nseldom to be met with in the European market.[2370]\r\n\r\n_Madras Turmeric_ is a fine sort in large, bold pieces. Sometimes\r\npackages of it contain exclusively round rhizomes, while others are\r\nmade up entirely of the long or lateral.\r\n\r\n_Bengal Turmeric_ differs from the other varieties chiefly in its\r\ndeeper tint, and hence is the sort preferred for dyeing purposes.\r\n\r\n_Java Turmeric_ presents no very distinctive features; it is dusted\r\nwith its own powder, and does not show when broken a very brilliant\r\ncolour. Judging by the low price at which it is quoted it is not\r\nin great esteem. It is the produce of _Curcuma longa_ var. β.\r\n_minor_[2371] Hassk.\r\n\r\n[2369] Hanbury, _Pharm. Journ._ iii. (1862) 206; also _Science Papers_,\r\n254, fig. 11.—It is not wholly devoid of yellow colouring matter.\r\n\r\n[2370] A good deal is exported from Takow in Formosa, but mostly to\r\nChinese ports.—_Returns of Trade at the Treaty Ports of China for\r\n1872._ p. 106.\r\n\r\n[2371] From information communicated by Mr. Binnendyk, of the Botanical\r\nGarden, Buitenzorg, Java.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The suberous coat is made up of 8 to 10 rows\r\nof tabular cells; the parenchyme of the middle cortical layer of large\r\nroundish polyhedral cells. Towards the centre the transverse section\r\nexhibits a coherent ring of fibro-vascular bundles representing a kind\r\nof medullary sheath. The parenchyme enclosed by this ring is traversed\r\nby scattered bundles of vessels, and in most of its cells contains\r\nstarch in amorphous, angular, or roundish masses, which are so far\r\ndisorganized that they no longer exhibit the usual appearance in\r\npolarized light, but are nevertheless turned blue by iodine. The starch\r\nhas been reduced to this condition by scalding.\r\n\r\nResin likewise occurs in separate cells, forming dark yellowish-red\r\nparticles. The entire tissue is penetrated with yellow colouring\r\nmatter, and shows numerous drops of essential oil, which in the fresh\r\nrhizome is no doubt contained in peculiar cells.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The drug yielded us (1876) one per cent. of a\r\nyellow essential oil, which contains a portion boiling at 250° C.,\r\nanswering to the formula C₁₀H₁₄O; this liquid differs from carvol (p.\r\n306) by being unable to combine with SH₂. The other constituents of\r\ncurcuma oil boil at temperatures much above 250°; we found the crude\r\noil and its different portions slightly dextrogyrate.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous extract of the drug tastes bitter, and is precipitated by\r\ntannic acid.\r\n\r\nThe colouring matter, _Curcumin_, C₁₀H₁₁₀O₃, may be obtained to the\r\namount of ⅓ per cent. by depriving first the drug of fat and essential\r\noil. The powder, after that treatment with bisulphide of carbon, is\r\ngradually exhausted, according to Daube (1871), with warm petroleum\r\n(boiling point 80°-90° C.). On cooling chiefly the last portions of\r\npetroleum deposit the crystalline curcumin. Its alcoholic solution\r\nis purified by mixing it cautiously with basic acetate of lead, not\r\nallowing the liquid to assume a decidedly acid reaction. The red\r\nprecipitate thus formed is collected, washed with alcohol, immersed\r\nin water, and decomposed with sulphuretted hydrogen. From the dried\r\nmixture of sulphide of lead and curcumin the latter is lastly removed\r\nby boiling alcohol.\r\n\r\nBy Ivanow-Gajewsky (1873) the best produce of curcumin is stated to be\r\nobtained by washing an ethereal extract of turmeric with weak ammonia,\r\ndissolving the residue in boiling concentrated ammonia, and passing\r\ninto the solution carbonic acid, by which the curcumin is precipitated\r\nin flakes.\r\n\r\nAfter due recrystallization from alcohol curcumin forms yellow\r\ncrystals, having an odour of vanilla, and exhibiting a fine blue in\r\nreflected light. They melt at 165° C. Curcumin is scarcely soluble,\r\neven in boiling water, but dissolves readily on addition of an alkali\r\neither caustic or carbonate. On acidulating these solutions, a yellow\r\npowder of curcumin is precipitated. Curcumin is not abundantly\r\ndissolved by ether, very sparingly by benzol or bisulphide of carbon.\r\nIt is not volatile; heated with zinc dust it yields an oil boiling at\r\n290°; fused with caustic potash, curcumin affords protocatechuic acid\r\n(page 243).\r\n\r\nPaper tinged with an alcoholic solution of curcumin displays on\r\naddition of an alkali a brownish-red coloration, becoming violet on\r\ndrying. Boracic acid produces an orange tint, turning blue by addition\r\nof an alkaline solution.[2372] This behaviour of (impure) curcumin was\r\npointed out by Vogel as early as 1815, and has since that time been\r\nutilized as a chemical test.\r\n\r\n[2372] The following is a striking experiment, showing some of these\r\nchanges of colour:—Place a little crushed turmeric or the powder on\r\nblotting paper, and moisten it repeatedly with chloroform, allowing the\r\nlatter to evaporate. There will thus be formed on the paper a yellow\r\nstain, which on addition of a slightly acidulated solution of borax and\r\ndrying assumes a purple hue. If the paper is now sprinkled with dilute\r\nammonia it will acquire a transient blue. This reaction enables one to\r\nrecognize the presence of turmeric in powdered rhubarb or mustard.\r\n\r\nBorax added to an alcoholic solution of curcumin gives rise to a\r\ncrystallizable substance, which Ivanow-Gajewsky (1870) isolated by\r\nheating an alcoholic extract of turmeric with boracic and sulphuric\r\nacids. It forms a purple crystalline powder with a metallic green\r\nlustre, insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol. Its solution is\r\ncoloured dark blue by an alkali.\r\n\r\nAccording to the same chemist there also exists in curcuma an alkaloid\r\nin very small quantity. Kachler (1870) found in the aqueous decoction\r\nan abundance of _bioxalate of potassium_.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—In the year 1869 there were imported into the United Kingdom\r\n64,280 cwt. of turmeric; in 1870, 44,900 cwt.,—a very large proportion\r\nbeing furnished by Bengal and Pegu. The export from Calcutta[2373] in\r\nthe year 1870-71 was 59,352 cwt.\r\n\r\nBombay exported in the year 1871-72, 29,780 cwt., of which the greater\r\nportion was shipped to Sind and the Persian Gulf, and only 910 cwt. to\r\nEurope.[2374]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Turmeric is employed as a condiment in the shape of curry\r\npowder, and as such is often sold by druggists; but as a medicine it is\r\nobsolete. It is largely consumed in dyeing.\r\n\r\n=Substitute=—_Cochin Turmeric_ is the produce of some other species of\r\n_Curcuma_ than _C. longa_. It consists exclusively of a bulb-shaped\r\nrhizome of large dimensions, cut transversely or longitudinally\r\ninto slices or segments. The cortical part is dull brown; the inner\r\nsubstance is horny and of a deep orange-brown, or when in thin shavings\r\nof a brilliant yellow. Mr. A. Forbes Sealy of Cochin has been good\r\nenough to send us (1873) living rhizomes of this _Curcuma_, which he\r\nstates is mostly grown at Alwaye, north-east of Cochin, and is never\r\nused in the country as _turmeric_, though its starchy tubers are\r\nemployed for making arrowroot. The rhizomes sent are thick, short,\r\nconical, and of enormous size, some attaining as much as 2½ inches in\r\ndiameter. Internally they are of a bright orange-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful figures of Roscoe[2375] show several species of Curcuma\r\nand Zingiber provided with yellow tubers or rhizomes, all probably\r\ncontaining curcumin.\r\n\r\n[2373] Returns quoted at p. 571, note 2.\r\n\r\n[2374] _Statement of the Trade and Navigation of Bombay for_ 1871-72,\r\npt. ii. 95.\r\n\r\n[2375] _Monandrous Plants of the order Scitamineæ_, Liverpool, 1828,\r\nespecially _Zingiber Cossumunar_.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHIZOMA GALANGÆ.\r\n\r\n_Radix Galangæ[2376] minoris_; _Galangal_; F. _Racine de Galanga_; G.\r\n_Galgant_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Alpinia officinarum_ Hance,[2377] a flag-like\r\nplant, with stems about 4 feet high, clothed with narrow lanceolate\r\nleaves, and terminating in short and simple racemes of elegant white\r\nflowers, shaded and veined with dull red. It grows cultivated in the\r\nisland of Hainan in the south of China, and, as is supposed, in some of\r\nthe southern provinces of the Chinese Empire.\r\n\r\n[2376] _Galanga_ appears to be derived from the Arabic name\r\n_Khulanjan_, which in turn comes from the Chinese _Kau-liang Kiang_,\r\nsignifying, as Dr. F. Porter Smith has informed us, _Kau-liang ginger_.\r\nKau-liang is the ancient name of a district in the province of\r\nKwangtung.\r\n\r\n[2377] _Journ. of Linnean Society_, Botany, xiii.

Edrisi,[2379] three hundred years later, is more explicit,\r\nfor he mentions it with many other productions of the far East, as\r\nbrought from India and China to Aden, then a great emporium of the\r\ntrade of Asia with Egypt and Europe. The physician Alkindi,[2380] who\r\nlived at Bassora and Bagdad in the second half of the 9th century,\r\nand somewhat later Rhazes and Avicenna, notice galangal, the use of\r\nwhich was introduced into Europe[2381] through the medical system\r\npromulgated by them and other writers of the same school. As to Great\r\nBritain, galingal, as it was frequently spelt, also occurs in the Welsh\r\n“Meddygon Myddfai” (see Appendix).\r\n\r\nMany notices exist showing that galangal was imported with pepper,\r\nginger, cloves, nutmegs, cardamoms and zedoary; and that during the\r\nmiddle ages it was used in common with these substances as a culinary\r\nspice, which it is still held to be in certain parts of Europe.[2382]\r\nThe plant affording the drug was unknown until the year 1870, when a\r\ndescription of it was communicated to the Linnean Society of London by\r\nDr. H. F. Hance, from specimens collected by Mr. E. C. Taintor, near\r\nHoihow in the north of Hainan.\r\n\r\n[2378] Work quoted in the Appendix—tome v. 294.\r\n\r\n[2379] _Géographie_, i.

(1871) 20; _Pharm.\r\nJourn._ Sept. 23, 1871. 248; _Science Papers_, 370.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The drug consists of a cylindrical rhizome, having\r\na maximum diameter of about ¾ of an inch, but for the most part\r\nconsiderably smaller. This rhizome has been cut while fresh into short\r\npieces, 1½ to 3 inches in length, which are often branched, and are\r\nmarked transversely at short intervals by narrow raised sinuous rings,\r\nindicating the former attachment of leaves or scales. The pieces\r\nare hard, tough and shrivelled, externally of a dark reddish-brown,\r\ndisplaying when cut transversely an internal substance of rather paler\r\nhue (but never white), with a darker central column. The drug exhales\r\nwhen comminuted an agreeable aroma, and has a strongly pungent, spicy\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The central portion of the rhizome is separated\r\nfrom the outer tissue by the nucleus-sheath, which appears as a\r\nwell-defined darker line. Yet the central tissue does not differ much\r\nfrom that surrounding it, both being composed of uniform parenchyme\r\ncells, traversed by scattered vascular bundles. There also occur\r\nthroughout the whole tissue isolated cells loaded with essential oil or\r\nresin. But the larger number of cells abound in large starch granules\r\nof an unusual club-shaped form. Some cells contain a brown substance,\r\ndiffering from resin in being insoluble in alcohol. The corky layer is\r\nremarkable from its cells having undulated walls.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The odour of galangal is due to an essential\r\noil, which the rhizoma yields to the extent of only 0·7 per cent., and\r\nwhich we found to be very slightly deviating the plane of polarization\r\nto the left.\r\n\r\nBrandes[2383] extracted from Galangal, by means of ether, an inodorous,\r\ntasteless, crystalline body called _Kämpferid_, which is worthy of\r\nfurther examination.\r\n\r\nThe pungent principle of the drug, which is probably analogous to that\r\nof ginger, has not been studied.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Galangal is shipped from Canton to other ports of China, to\r\nIndia and Europe, but there are no general statistics to give an idea\r\nof the total production. From official returns quoted by Hance, the\r\nexport of the year 1869, which seems to have been exceptionally large,\r\namounted to 370,800 lb. From Kiung-chow, island of Hainan, 2,113 peculs\r\n(281,733 lb.) were exported in 1877.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The drug is an aromatic stimulant of the nature of ginger, now\r\nnearly obsolete in British medicine. It is still a popular remedy and\r\nspice in Livonia, Esthonia and central Russia, and by the Tartars is\r\ntaken with tea. It is also in some requisition in Russia among brewers,\r\nand the manufacturers of vinegar and cordials, and finally as a cattle\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n=Substitute=—The rhizoma of _Alpina Galanga_ Willd., a plant of Java,\r\nconstitutes the drug known as _Radix Galangæ majoris_ or _Greater\r\nGalangal_, packages of which occasionally appear in the London drug\r\nsales. It may be at once distinguished from the Chinese drug by its\r\nmuch larger size and the pale buff hue of its internal substance, the\r\nlatter in strong contrast with the orange-brown outer skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUCTUS CARDAMOMI.\r\n\r\n_Semina Cardamomi minoris_; _Cardamoms_, _Malabar Cardamoms_; F.\r\n_Cardamomes_; G. _Cardamomen_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Elettaria[2384] Cardamomum_ Maton (_Alpinia\r\nCardamomum_ Roxb.), a flag-like perennial plant, 6 to 12 feet high,\r\nwith large lanceolate leaves on long sheathing stalks, and flowers in\r\nlax flexuose horizontal scapes, 6 to 18 inches in length, which are\r\nthrown out to the number of 3 or 4, close to the ground. The fruit is\r\novoid, three-sided, plump and smooth, with a fleshy green pericarp.\r\n\r\nThe Cardamom plant grows abundantly, both wild and under cultivation,\r\nin the moist shady mountain forests of North Canara, Coorg and Wynaad\r\non the Malabar Coast; at an elevation of 2500 to 5000 feet above\r\nthe sea. It is truly wild in Canara and in the Anamalai, Cochin and\r\nTravancore forests.[2385] The cardamom region has a mean temperature of\r\n22° C. (72° F.), and a mean rainfall of 121 inches.\r\n\r\n[2383] _Archiv der Pharm._ xix. (1839) 52.\r\n\r\n[2384] From _Elettari_, the Mallyalim name of the plant.—Fig. in\r\nBentley and Trimen’s _Med. Plants_, part 24 (1877).\r\n\r\n[2385] The small “_Cardamom_“ island in the Laccadive group, west of\r\nMalabar, is inhabited by Moplahs, known (as we are informed by Dr.\r\nKing, Calcutta) in the south of India as dealers in cardamoms.\r\n\r\nA well-marked variety, differing chiefly in the elongated form and\r\nlarge size of its fruits, is found wild in the forests of the central\r\nand southern provinces of Ceylon. It was formerly regarded as a\r\ndistinct species under the name of _Elettaria major_, but careful\r\nobservation of growing specimens has shown that it possesses no\r\ncharacters to warrant it being considered more than a variety of the\r\ntypical plant, and it is therefore now called _E. Cardamomum_ var. β.\r\nIt is only known to occur in Ceylon, where the ordinary cardamom of\r\nMalabar is not found except as a cultivated plant.[2386]\r\n\r\n=History=—Cardamoms, _Elā_, are mentioned in the writings of Susruta,\r\nand hence may have been used in India from a remote period. It is not\r\nunlikely that in common with ginger and pepper they reached Europe in\r\nclassical times, although it is not possible from the descriptions\r\nthat have come down to determine exactly what was the Καρδάμωμον of\r\nTheophrastus and Dioscorides, or the Ἄμωμον of the last named writer.\r\nThe _Amomum_, _Amomis_ and _Cardamomum_ of Pliny are also doubtful, the\r\ndescription he gives of the last being unintelligible as applied to\r\nanything now known by that name.\r\n\r\nIn the list of Indian spices liable to duty at Alexandria, _circa_\r\nA.D. 176-180 (see Appendix, A), _Amomum_ as well as _Cardamomum_ is\r\nmentioned. St. Jerome names _Amomum_ together with musk, as perfumes in\r\nuse among the voluptuous ecclesiastics of the 4th century.[2387]\r\n\r\nCardamoms are named by Edrisi[2388] about A.D. 1154 as a production of\r\nCeylon, and also as an article of trade from China to Aden; and in the\r\nsame century they are mentioned together with cinnamon and cloves (p.\r\n282) as an import in Palestine by way of Acre, then a trading city of\r\nthe Levant.[2389]\r\n\r\nThe first writer who definitely and correctly states the country of the\r\ncardamom appears to be the Portuguese navigator Barbosa[2390] (1514),\r\nwho frequently names it as a production of the Malabar coast. Garcia\r\nde Orta[2391] mentions the shipment of the drug to Europe; he also\r\nascertained that the larger sort was produced in Ceylon. The Malabar\r\ncardamon plant was figured by Rheede under its indigenous name of\r\n_Elettari_.[2392]\r\n\r\n[2386] Thwaites, _Enumeratio Plantarum Zeylaniæ_, 1864. 318.\r\n\r\n[2387] _S.

The methods\r\nof cultivation, which vary in the different districts, may be thus\r\ndescribed:—\r\n\r\n1. Previous to the commencement of the rains the cultivators ascend\r\nthe mountain sides, and seek in the shady evergreen forests a spot\r\nwhere some cardamom plants are growing. Here they make small clearings,\r\nin which the admission of light occasions the plant to develope in\r\nabundance. The cardamom plants attain 2 to 3 feet in height during the\r\nfollowing monsoon, after which the ground is again cleared of weeds,\r\nprotected with a fence, and left to itself for a year. About two years\r\nafter the first clearing the plants begin to flower, and five months\r\nlater ripen some fruits, but a full crop is not got till at least\r\na year after. The plants continue productive six or seven years. A\r\ngarden, 484 square yards in area, four of which may be made in an\r\nacre of forest, will give on an average an annual crop of 12½ lbs. of\r\ngarbled cardamoms.[2393] Ludlow, an Assistant Conservator of Forests,\r\nreckons that not more than 28 lbs. can be got from an acre of forest.\r\nFrom what he says, it further appears that the plants which come up\r\non clearings of the Coorg forests are mainly _seedlings_, which make\r\ntheir appearance in the same _quasi_-spontaneous manner as certain\r\nplants in the clearings of a wood in Europe. He says they commence\r\nto bear in about 3½ years after their first appearance.[2394] The\r\nplan of cultivation above described is that pursued in the forests of\r\nTravancore, Coorg and Wynaad.\r\n\r\n2. On the lower range of the Pulney Hills, near Dindigul, at an\r\nelevation of about 5,000 feet above the sea, the cardamom plant is\r\ncultivated in the shade. The natives burn down the underwood, and clear\r\naway the small trees of the dense moist forests called _sholas_, which\r\nare damp all the year round. The cardamoms are then sown, and when a\r\nfew inches high are planted out, either singly or in twos, under the\r\nshade of the large trees. They take five years before they bear fruit:\r\n“in October,” remarks our informant,[2395] “I saw the plants in full\r\nflower and also in fruit,—the latter not however ripe.”\r\n\r\n[2393] _Report on the Administration of Coorg for the year 1872-73_,\r\nBangalore, 1873. 44.\r\n\r\n[2394] Elliot, _Experiences of a Planter in the Jungles of Mysore_,\r\nLond. ii. (1871) 201, 209.\r\n\r\n[2395] Col. Beddome, Conservator of Forests, Madras. We have\r\nlikewise to acknowledge information on this head from Dr. Brandia,\r\nInspector-General of Forests in India, and Dr. King, Director of the\r\nBotanic Garden, Calcutta.\r\n\r\n3. In North Canara and Western Mysore the cardamom is cultivated in\r\nthe betel-nut plantations. The plants, which are raised from seed, are\r\nplanted between the palms, from which and from plantains they derive a\r\ncertain amount of shade. They are said to produce fruit in their third\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nCardamoms begin to ripen in October, and the gathering continues during\r\ndry weather for two or three months. All the fruits on a scape do not\r\nbecome ripe at the same time, yet too generally the whole scape is\r\ngathered at once and dried,—to the manifest detriment of the drug.\r\nThis is done partly to save the fruit from being eaten by snakes,\r\nfrogs and squirrels, and partly to avoid the capsules splitting, which\r\nthey do when quite mature. In some plantations however the cardamoms\r\nare gathered in a more reasonable fashion. As they are collected the\r\nfruits are carried to the houses, laid out for a few days on mats,\r\nthen stripped from their scapes, and the drying completed by a gentle\r\nfire-heat. In Coorg the fruit is stripped from the scape before drying,\r\nand the drying is sometimes effected wholly by sun-heat.\r\n\r\nIn the native states of Cochin and Travancore cardamoms are a monopoly\r\nof the respective governments. The rajah of the latter state requires\r\nthat all the produce shall be sold to his officials, who forward it to\r\nthe main depôt at Alapalli or Aleppi, a port in Travancore, where his\r\ncommercial agent resides. The rajah is tenacious of his rights, and\r\ninserts a clause in the leases he grants to European coffee-planters,\r\nof whom a great many have settled in his territory, requiring that\r\ncardamoms shall not be grown.\r\n\r\nThe cardamoms at Aleppi are sold by auction, and bought chiefly by\r\nMoplah merchants for transport to different parts of India, and also,\r\nthrough third parties, to England. All the lower qualities are consumed\r\nin India, and the finer alone shipped to Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the forests belonging to the British Government cardamoms are mostly\r\nreckoned among the miscellaneous items of produce; but in Coorg, the\r\ncardamom forests are now let at a rental of £3,000 per annum under a\r\nlease which will expire in 1878.[2396]\r\n\r\nDr. Cleghorn, late Conservator of Forests in the Madras Presidency,\r\nobserves in a letter to one of us, that the rapid extension of coffee\r\nculture along the slopes of the Malabar mountains has tended to lessen\r\nthe production of cardamoms, and has encroached considerably upon the\r\narea of their indigenous growth. A recent writer[2397] has shown from\r\nhis own experience that the cultivation of the cardamom is a branch of\r\nindustry worth the attention of Europeans, and has given many valuable\r\ndetails for insuring successful results.\r\n\r\n[2396] Report quoted at p. 645. note 1.\r\n\r\n[2397] Elliot, _op. cit._, chap. 12.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit of the Malabar cardamom as found in\r\ncommerce is an ovoid or oblong, three-sided, three-valved capsule,\r\ncontaining numerous seeds arranged in three cells. It is rounded\r\nat the base, and often retains a small stalk; towards the apex it\r\nis more or less contracted, and terminates in a short beak. The\r\nlongitudinally-striated, inodorous, tasteless pericarp is of a pale\r\ngreyish-yellow, or buff, or brown when fully ripe, of a thin papery\r\nconsistence, splitting lengthwise into three valves. From the middle\r\nof the inner side of each valve a thin partition projects towards the\r\naxis, thereby producing three cells, each of which encloses 5 to 7 dark\r\nbrown, aromatic seeds, arranged in two rows and attached in the central\r\nangle.\r\n\r\nThe seeds, which are about two lines long, are irregularly angular,\r\ntransversely rugose, and have a depressed hilum and a deeply channelled\r\nraphe. Each seed is enclosed in a thin colourless aril.\r\n\r\nCardamoms vary in size, shape, colour and flavour: those which are\r\nshortly ovoid or nearly globular, and ⁴/₁₀ to ⁶/₁₀ of an inch in\r\nlength, are termed in trade language _shorts_; while those of a more\r\nelongated form, pointed at each end, and ⁷/₁₀ to ⁹/₁₀ of an inch long,\r\nare called _short-longs_. They are further distinguished by the names\r\nof localities, as Malabar (or Mangalore), Aleppi, and Madras. The\r\n_Malabar Cardamoms_, which are the most esteemed, are of full colour,\r\nand occur of both forms, namely _shorts_ and _short-longs_; they are\r\nbrought to Europe _viâ_ Bombay. Those terms _Aleppi_ are generally\r\n_shorts_, plump, beaked and of a peculiar greenish tint; they are\r\nimported from Calicut, and sometimes from Aleppi. The _Madras_ are\r\nchiefly of elongated form (_short-longs_) and of a more pallid hue;\r\nthey are shipped at Madras and Pondicherry.\r\n\r\nCardamoms are esteemed in proportion to their plumpness and heaviness,\r\nand the sound and mature condition of the seeds they contain. Good\r\nsamples afford about three-fourths of their weight of seeds.[2398]\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the second form (var. β) of _Elettaria Cardamomum_, known\r\nin trade as _Ceylon Cardamoms_, are from 1 to 2 inches in length, and\r\n³/₁₀ to ⁴/₁₀ of an inch in breadth, distinctly three-sided, often\r\narched, and always of a dark greyish-brown. The seeds are larger and\r\nmore numerous than those of the Malabar plant, and somewhat different\r\nin odour and taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The testa of the seed consists of three\r\ndistinct layers, namely an exterior of thick-walled, spirally-striated\r\ncells, somewhat longitudinally extended, and exhibiting on transverse\r\nsection, square, not very large, cavities; then a row of large cells\r\nwith thin transverse walls; and finally, an internal layer of deep\r\nbrown, radially-arranged cells, the walls of which have so thick a\r\ndeposit that at the most only small cavities remain.\r\n\r\nThe granular, colourless, sac-shaped albumen encloses a horny\r\nendosperm, in which the embryo is inserted the projecting radicle\r\nbeing directed towards the hilum. The cells of the albumen have the\r\nform of elongated polyhedra, almost entirely filled with very small\r\nstarch granules. Besides them, there occur in most of the cells,\r\nsomewhat larger masses of albuminoid matter having a rhombohedric form,\r\ndistinctly observable when thin slices of the seed are examined under\r\nalmond oil in polarized light. These remarkable crystalloid bodies\r\nresemble those occurring in the seeds of cumin (p. 332).\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The parenchyme of the albumen and embryo is\r\nloaded with fatty oil and essential oil, the former existing in the\r\nseed to the extent of about 10 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of essential oil is stated by Messrs. Schimmel & Co.,\r\nLeipzig, to be equal to 5 in the Madras Cardamoms, and to 3·5 in the\r\nCeylon. We found the latter to be dextrogyrate; the same gentlemen\r\npresented us (1876) with a crystallized deposit from the latter oil,\r\nwhich appears to be _identical with common camphor_. Its alcoholic\r\nsolution deviates the plane of polarization to the right, apparently to\r\nthe same amount as that of common camphor (see also oil of spike, p.\r\n479).\r\n\r\nDumas and Péligot (1834) state to have obtained from the essential oil\r\nof cardamoms (inodorous?) crystals of terpin, C₁₀H₁₆ + 3 OH₂. The ash\r\nof cardamoms, in common with that of several other plants of the same\r\norder, is remarkably rich in manganese.[2399]\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—There are no statistics to show the production of cardamoms\r\nin the south of India or even the quantity exported. The shipments in\r\nthe year 1872-73 from Bombay, to which port the drug is largely sent\r\nfrom the Madras Presidency, amounted to 1,650 cwt., of which 1,055 cwt.\r\nwere exported to the United Kingdom.[2400]\r\n\r\nCardamoms, the produce of Ceylon and therefore of the _large_ variety,\r\nwere exported from that island in 1872 to the extent of 9,273 lb.—the\r\nwhole quantity being shipped to the United Kingdom.[2401]\r\n\r\n[2398] Thus 202 lb. shelled at various times during 10 years, afforded\r\n154½ lb. of seeds.

As an ingredient in curry powder,\r\nthey have also some use as a condiment. But the consumption in England\r\nis small in comparison with what it is in Russia, Sweden, Norway and\r\nparts of Germany, where they are constantly employed as a spice for the\r\nflavouring of cakes. In these countries Ceylon cardamoms are also used,\r\nbut exclusively for the manufacture of liqueurs. In India, cardamoms,\r\nbesides being used in medicine, are employed as a condiment and for\r\nchewing with betel.\r\n\r\nOther sorts of Cardamom.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of several other plants of the order _Zingiberaceæ_ have\r\nat various times been employed in pharmacy under the common name of\r\n_Cardamom_. We shall here notice only those which have some importance\r\nin European or Indian commerce.[2402]\r\n\r\n_Round or Cluster Cardamom_—_Amomum Cardamomum_ L., the mother plant of\r\nthis drug, is a native of Cambodia, Siam, Sumatra and Java.\r\n\r\nDuring the intercourse with Siam, which was frequent in the early\r\npart of the 17th century, this drug, which is there in common use,\r\noccasionally found its way into Europe. Clusius received a specimen\r\nof it in 1605 as the true _Amomum_ of the ancients, and figured it\r\nas a great rarity.[2403] As _Amomum verum_ it had a place in the\r\npharmacopœias of this period. Parkinson (1640), who figures it as\r\n_Amomum genuinum_, says that “of late days it hath been sent to Venice\r\nfrom the East Indies.” Dale (1693) and Pomet (1694) both regarded it as\r\na rare drug; the latter says it is brought from Holland, and that it is\r\nthe only thing that ought to be used when _Amomum_ is ordered. In 1751\r\nit was so scarce that in making the _Theriaca Andromachi_ some other\r\ndrug had always to be substituted for it.[2404]\r\n\r\nThus it had completely disappeared, when about the year 1853 commercial\r\nrelations were re-opened with Siam; and among the commodities poured\r\ninto the market were _Round Cardamoms_. They were not appreciated, and\r\nthe importations becoming unprofitable, soon ceased.[2405] They are\r\nnevertheless an article of considerable traffic in Eastern Asia.\r\n\r\nRound Cardamoms are produced in small compact bunches.[2406] Each\r\nfruit is globular, ⁵/₁₀ to ⁷/₁₀ of an inch in diameter, marked\r\nwith longitudinal furrows, and sometimes distinctly three-lobed.\r\nThe pericarp is thin, fragile, somewhat hairy, of a buff colour,\r\nenclosing a three-lobed mass of seeds, which are mostly shrivelled\r\nas if the fruit had been gathered unripe. The seeds, which have a\r\ngeneral resemblance to those of the Malabar cardamom, have a strong\r\ncamphoraceous, aromatic taste.\r\n\r\n[2402] For additional information on the various sorts of Cardamom,\r\nconsult Guibourt, _Hist. des Drog._ ii. (1869) 215-227; Pereira,\r\n_Elements of Mat. Med._ ii., part i. (1855) 243-263; Hanbury in _Pharm.\r\nJourn._ xiv. (1855) 352. 416; _Science Papers_, 93-15.\r\n\r\n[2403] _Exoticorum Libri_, 377. Yet it already occurs in the\r\n_Dispensatorium_ of Valerius Cordus.\r\n\r\n[2404] Hill, _Hist. of the Mat. Med._, Lond. (1751) 472.\r\n\r\n[2405] Thus 43 bags, imported direct from Bangkok, were offered for\r\nsale in London, 26 March, 1857, and bought in at 1_s._ 6_d._ per lb.\r\n\r\n[2406] Fig. in Guibourt, _l. c._ 215.\r\n\r\nThere is a large export from Siam of cardamoms of this and the\r\nfollowing sort. The shipments from Bangkok in 1871 amounted to 4,678\r\npeculs (623,733 lbs.), and were all to Singapore and China.[2407]\r\nIn 1875 we noticed the export from Bangkok of 267 peculs of “true”\r\ncardamoms, valued at 45,140 dollars, and 3,267 peculs of “bastard”\r\ncardamoms, value 92,865 dollars; the latter no doubt refer to the\r\nfollowing kind:[2408]—\r\n\r\n_Xanthioid Cardamom_; _Wild or Bastard Cardamom of Siam_—This is\r\nafforded by _Amomum xanthioides_ Wallich, a native of Tenasserim and\r\nSiam. During the past thirty years the seeds of this plant, deprived\r\nof their capsules, have often been imported into the London market,\r\nand they are now also common in the bazaars of India.[2409] They\r\nclosely resemble the seeds of the Malabar cardamom, differing chiefly\r\nin flavour and in being rather more finely rugose. Occasionally they\r\nare imported still cohering in ovoid, three-lobed masses, as packed in\r\nthe pericarp. Sometimes they are distinguished as _Bastard_ or _Wild_,\r\nbut are more generally termed simply _Cardamom Seeds_. They are a\r\nconsiderable article of trade in Siam.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of this species grow in round clusters and are remarkable\r\nfor having the pericarp thickly beset with weak fleshy spines,[2410]\r\nwhich gives them some resemblance to the fruits of a _Xanthium_, and\r\nhas suggested the specific name.\r\n\r\n_Bengal Cardamom_—This drug, which with the next two has been hitherto\r\nconfounded under one name,[2411] is afforded by _Amomum subulatum_\r\nRoxb.,[2412] a native of the Morung mountains, to the S.S.W. of\r\nDarjiling, in about 26°·30′ N. lat. The fruit is known by the name\r\nof _Winged Bengal Cardamom_, _Morung Elachi_ or _Buro Elachi_. They\r\naverage about an inch in length, and are of ovoid or slightly obconic\r\nform, and obscurely 3-sided; the lower end is rounded and usually\r\ndevoid of stalk. The upper part of the fruit is provided with 9 narrow\r\njagged wings or ridges, which become apparent after maceration; and the\r\nsummit terminates in a truncate bristly nipple,—never protracted into a\r\nlong tube. The pericarp is coarsely striated, and of a deep brown. It\r\neasily splits into 3 valves, inclosing a 3-lobed mass of seeds, 60 to\r\n80 in number, agglutinated by a viscid saccharine pulp, due to the aril\r\nwith which each seed is surrounded. The seeds are of roundish form,\r\nrendered angular by mutual pressure, and about ⅛ of an inch long; they\r\nhave a highly aromatic, camphoraceous taste.\r\n\r\n[2407] _Commercial Report of H.M.

(1850) 1135.\r\n\r\n[2412] According to Dr. King, in Sir Joseph Hooker’s _Report on the\r\nRoyal Gardens at Kew_, 1877. 27.\r\n\r\n_Nepal Cardamom_—The description of the Bengal cardamom applies in many\r\npoints to this drug, to which it has a singularly close resemblance.\r\nThe fruit is of the same size and form, and is also crowned in its\r\nupper part with thin jagged ridges, and marked in a similar manner\r\nwith longitudinal striæ; and lastly, the seeds have the same shape and\r\nflavour. But it differs, firstly, in bearing on its summit a tubular\r\ncalyx, which is as long or longer than the fruit itself; and, secondly,\r\nin the fruit being often attached to a short stalk. The fruits are\r\nborne on an ovoid scape, 3 to 4 inches long, densely crowded with\r\noverlapping bracts, which are remarkably broad and truncate with a\r\nsharp central claw,—very distinct from the much narrower ovate bracts\r\nof _A. aromaticum_, as shown in Roxburgh’s unpublished drawing of that\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe plant, which is unquestionably a species of _Amomum_, has not\r\nyet been identified with any published description. We have to thank\r\nColonel Richard C. Lawrence, British Resident at Katmandu, for sending\r\nus a fruit-scape in alcohol, some dried leaves, and also the drug\r\nitself,—the last agreeing perfectly with specimens obtained through\r\nother channels.\r\n\r\nThe Nepal cardamom, the first account of which is due to\r\nHamilton,[2413] is cultivated on the frontiers of Nepal, near\r\nDarjiling. The plant is stated by Col. Lawrence to attain 3 to 6 feet\r\nin height, and to be grown on well-watered slopes of the hills, under\r\nthe shelter of trees. The fruit is exported to other parts of India.\r\n\r\n_Java Cardamom_—A well-marked fruit, produced by _Amomum maximum_\r\nRoxb., a plant of Java. The fruits are arranged to the number of 30\r\nto 40 on a short thick scape, and form a globose group, 4 inches in\r\ndiameter. They are stalked, and of a conical or ovoid form, in the\r\nfresh state as much as 1½ inches long by 1 inch broad. Each fruit is\r\nprovided with 9 to 10 prominent wings, ⅛ of an inch high, running from\r\nbase to apex, and coarsely toothed except in their lowest part. The\r\nsummit is crowned by a short, withered, calycinal tube.\r\n\r\nMr. Binnendyk, of the Botanical garden of Buitenzorg, in Java, who has\r\nkindly supplied us with fine specimens of _A. maximum_, as well as with\r\nan admirable coloured drawing, states that the plant is cultivated, and\r\nthat its fruits are sold for the sake of their agreeable edible pulp.\r\nWe do not know whether the dried fruits or the seeds are ever exported.\r\nPereira confounded them with Bengal and Nepal cardamoms.\r\n\r\n_Korarima Cardamom_—The Arab Physicians were acquainted with a sort\r\nof cardamom called _Heil_, which was later known in Europe, and is\r\nmentioned in the most ancient printed pharmacopœias as _Cardamomum\r\nmajus_,[2414] a name occurring also in Valerius Cordus and Mattiolus.\r\nLike some other Eastern drugs, it gradually disappeared from European\r\ncommerce, and its name came to be transferred to _Grains of Paradise_,\r\nwhich to the present day are known in the shops as _Semina Cardamomi\r\nmajoris_.\r\n\r\n[2413] _Account of the Kingdom of Nepal_, Edin. 1819. 74-75.\r\n\r\n[2414] As the _Tesaurus Aromatariorum_, printed at Milan in 1496, in\r\nwhich it is called _Heil_ or _Gardamomum majus_.\r\n\r\nThe true _Cardamomum majus_ is a conical fruit,[2415] in size and shape\r\nnot unlike a small fig reversed, containing roundish angular seeds,\r\nof an agreeable aromatic flavour, much resembling that of the Malabar\r\ncardamom, and quite devoid of the burning taste of grains of paradise.\r\nEach fruit is perforated, having been strung on a cord to dry; such\r\nstrings of cardamoms are sometimes used by the Arabs as rosaries. The\r\nfruit in question is called in the Galla language _Korarima_, but it\r\nis also known as _Gurági_ spice, and by its Arabic names of _Heil_\r\nand _Habhal-habashi_.[2416] According to Beke,[2417] it is conveyed to\r\nthe market of Báso (10° N. lat.), in Southern Abyssinia, from Tumhé, a\r\nregion lying in about 9° N. lat. and 35° E. long.; thence it is carried\r\nto Massowah, on the Red Sea, and shipped for India and Arabia. Von\r\nHeuglin[2418] speaks of it as brought from the Galla country. It is not\r\nimprobable that it is the same fruit which Speke[2419] saw growing in\r\n1862 at Uganda, in lat 0°, and which he says is strung like a necklace\r\nby the Wagonda people. Under the name of _Heel Habashee_, Korarima\r\ncardamoms were contributed in 1873 from Shoa to the Vienna exhibition;\r\nwe have also been presented, in 1877, with an excellent specimen of\r\nthem, recently imported, by Messrs. Schimmel & Co., Leipzig.\r\n\r\nPereira proposed for the plant the name of _Amomum Korarima_, but it\r\nhas never been botanically described. It would appear from the above\r\nstatements that it must be indigenous to the whole mountainous region\r\nof Eastern Africa, from the Victoria Nyanza lake (Uganda) to the\r\ncountries of Tumhé, Gurague, and Shoa, south and south-eastward of\r\nAbyssinia.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANA PARADISI.\r\n\r\n_Semina Cardamomi majoris_, _Piper Melegueta_; _Grains of Paradise_,\r\n_Guinea Grains_, _Melegueta Pepper_; F. _Grains de Paradis_,\r\n_Maniguette_; G. _Paradieskörner_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Amomum Melegueta_ Roscoe—an herbaceous, reed-like\r\nplant, 3 to 5 feet high, producing on a scape rising scarcely an inch\r\nabove the ground, a delicate, wax-like, pale purple flower, which is\r\nsucceeded by a smooth, scarlet, ovoid fruit, 3 to 4 inches in length,\r\nrising out of sheathing bracts.[2420]\r\n\r\n[2415] Figured in Pereira, _Materia Medica_ ii. part i. (1855) 250, and\r\nalready in Mattioli’s _Commentar. in Dioscorid._ lib. i. (1558) 27.\r\n\r\n[2416] So named by Forskal in 1775 (_Materia Medica Kahirina_, 151. n.\r\n41) who says “_frequens in re culinariâ et medicâ, loco piperis_.”\r\n\r\n[2417] _Letters on the commerce of Abyssinia_, etc., addressed to the\r\nForeign Office, 1852; 4. 16. 20.\r\n\r\n[2418] _Reise nach Abessinien_, Jena, 1868. 223.\r\n\r\n[2419] _Journal of the discovery of the source of the Nile_, 1863. 648.\r\n\r\n[2420] Fig. in Bentley and Trimen’s _Medical Plants_, part 30 (1878).\r\n\r\nIt varies considerably in the dimensions of all its parts, according to\r\nmore or less favourable circumstances of soil and climate. In Demerara,\r\nwhere the plant grows luxuriously in cultivation, the fruit is as large\r\nas a fine pear, measuring with its tubular part as much as 5 inches in\r\nlength by 2 inches in diameter; on the other hand, in some parts of\r\nWest Africa it scarcely exceeds in size a large filbert. It has a thick\r\nfleshy pericarp, enclosing a colourless acid pulp of pleasant taste, in\r\nwhich are imbedded the numerous seeds.\r\n\r\n_A. Melegueta_ is widely distributed in tropical West Africa, occurring\r\nalong the coast region from Sierra Leone to Congo. The littoral region,\r\ntermed, in allusion to its producing grains of paradise, the _Grain\r\nCoast_, _Pepper Coast_, or _Melegueta Coast_, lies between Liberia and\r\nCape Palmas; or, more exactly, between Capes Mesurado (Montserrado)\r\nand St. Andrews. The Gold Coast, whence the seeds are now principally\r\nexported, is in the Gulf of Guinea, further eastward.\r\n\r\nOf the distribution of the plant in the interior we have no exact\r\ninformation. Yet the name Melegueta refers to the ancient empire of\r\nMelle (Meli or Melly), formerly extending over the upper Niger region,\r\nabout in 4° E. long., and then inhabited by the Mandingos, now by\r\nthe Fulbe or Fullãn. Messena is their most considerable place. In\r\nthat region _Amomum Melegueta_ may be indigenous, or the spice, being\r\nformerly exported from the coast by way of Melle, took its commercial\r\nname in allusion to the latter.\r\n\r\n=History=—There is no evidence that the ancients were acquainted with\r\nthe seeds called _Grains of Paradise_; nor can we find any reference\r\nto them earlier than an incidental mention under their African name,\r\nin the account[2421] of a curious festival held at Treviso in A.D.\r\n1214: it was a sort of tournament, during which a sham fortress, held\r\nby twelve noble ladies and their attendants, was besieged and stormed\r\nby assailants armed with flowers, fruits, sweetmeats, perfumes, and\r\nspices, amongst which last figure—_Melegetæ_!\r\n\r\nAfter this period there are many notices, showing the seeds to have\r\nbeen in general use. Nicolas Myrepsus,[2422] physician at the court\r\nof the Emperor John III. at Nicœa, in the 13th century, prescribed\r\nΜνεγέται; and his contemporary, Simon of Genoa,[2423] at Rome, names\r\nthe same drug as _Melegete_ or _Melegette_. _Grana Paradisi_ are\r\nenumerated among spices sold at Lyons[2424] in 1245, and were used\r\nabout the same time by the Welsh Physicians of Myddvai under the name\r\n_Grawn Paris_.[2425] They also occur as _Greyn Paradijs_ in a tariff of\r\nduties levied at Dordrecht in Holland[2426] in 1358. And again among\r\nthe spices used by John, king of France, when in England, A.D. 1359-60,\r\n_Grainne de Paradis_ is repeatedly mentioned.[2427]\r\n\r\nIn the earliest times the drug was conveyed by the long land journey\r\nfrom the Mandingo country through the desert to the Mediterranean\r\nport, Monte di Barca (Mundibarca), on the coast of Tripoli. There the\r\nspice was shipped by the Italians, and being the produce of an unknown\r\nregion and held in great esteem, it acquired the name of _Grains of\r\nParadise_,[2428] or also, as already stated at page 650, that of\r\n_Semina Cardamomi Majoris_. That they came from Melli is expressly\r\nstated also by Leonhard Fuchs.[2429] Small quantities of the drug still\r\nreach Tripoli in the same way.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the 14th century, there began to be direct\r\ncommercial intercourse with tropical Western Africa. Margry[2430]\r\nrelates that ships were sent thither from Dieppe in 1364, and took\r\ncargoes of ivory and _malaguette_ from near the mouth of the river\r\nCestos, now Sestros. A century later the coast was visited by the\r\nPortuguese, who termed it _Terra de malaguet_. The celebrated\r\nColumbus also, who traded to the coast of Guinea, called it _Costa di\r\nManiguetta_. Soon after this period the spice became a monopoly of the\r\nkings of Portugal.\r\n\r\n[2421] Rolandini Patavini _Chronica_—Pertz, _Monumenta Germaniæ\r\nhistorica; scriptores_, xix.

They were also employed with cinnamon and\r\nginger in making the spiced wine called _hippocras_, in vogue during\r\nthe 14th and 15th centuries.\r\n\r\nIn the Portuguese and Spanish idioms, the name _Melegueta_, spelt in\r\nvarious ways, as _Melegette_, _Melligetta_, _Mallaguetta_, _Manigete_,\r\n_Maniguette_, was subsequently also applied to other substitutes of\r\npepper, and even to that spice itself.\r\n\r\nIn the hands of modern botanists, the plant affording grains of\r\nparadise has been the subject of a complication of errors which it is\r\nneedless to discuss. Suffice it to say, that _Amomum Granum Paradisi_\r\nas described by Linnæus cannot be identified;—that in 1817, Afzelius,\r\na Swedish botanist, who resided some years at Sierra Leone, published\r\na description of “_Amomum Granum Paradisi_? Linn.,”[2432] but that\r\nthe specimen of it alleged to have been received from him, and now\r\npreserved in the herbarium of Sir J. E. Smith, belongs to another\r\nspecies. Under these circumstances, the name given to the grains of\r\nparadise plant by Roscoe, _A. Melegueta_, has been accepted as quite\r\nfree from doubt.[2433]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The seeds are about ⅒ of an inch in diameter, rather\r\nvariable in form, being roundish, bluntly angular or somewhat\r\npyramidal. They are hard, with a shining, reddish-brown, shagreen-like\r\nsurface. The hilum is beak-shaped and of paler colour. The seeds when\r\ncrushed are feebly aromatic, but have a most pungent and burning taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—In structure, grains of paradise agree in most\r\nrespects with cardamom seeds. Yet in the former, the cells of the\r\nalbumen have very thin, delicate walls which are much more elongated.\r\nOf the testa, only the innermost layer agrees with the corresponding\r\npart of cardamom; whilst the middle layer has the cell-walls so much\r\nthickened that only a few cavities, widely distant from one another,\r\nremain open. The outer layer of the testa consists of thick-walled\r\ncells, the cavities of which appear, on transverse section, radially\r\nextended. The albumen is loaded with starch granules of 2 to 5 mkm.\r\ndiameter, the whole amount in each cell being agglutinated, so as to\r\nform a coherent mass.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Grains of paradise contain a small proportion of\r\nessential oil; 53 lb. yielded us only 2½ oz., equivalent to nearly 0·30\r\nper cent.[2434] The oil is faintly yellowish, neutral, of an agreeable\r\nodour reminding one of the seeds, and of an aromatic, not acrid taste.\r\nIt has a sp. gr. at 15·5° C., of 0·825. It is but sparingly soluble\r\nin absolute alcohol or in spirit of wine; but mixes clearly with\r\nbisulphide of carbon; it dissolves iodine without explosion. When\r\nsaturated with dry hydrochloric gas, no solid compound is formed.\r\n\r\n[2431] Hakluyt, _Principal Navigations_, ii. pt. 2.—First Voiage of the\r\n_Primerose and Lion_ to Guinea and Benin, A.D. 1553.\r\n\r\n[2432] _Remedia Guineensia_, Upsaliæ, p. 71.\r\n\r\n[2433] I have repeatedly raised _Amomum Melegueta_ from commercial\r\nGrains of Paradise, and have cultivated the plant for some years,\r\nobtaining not only flowers, but large well-ripened fruits containing\r\nfertile seeds.—D. H.\r\n\r\n[2434] This oil was obtained and tried in medicine in the beginning of\r\nthe 17th century.—Porta, _De Distillatione_, Romæ, 1608, lib. iv. c. 4.\r\n\r\nThe oil begins to boil at about 236° C., and the chief bulk of it\r\ndistills at 257°-258°: the residual part is a thick brownish liquid.\r\nExamined in a column of 50 mm. long, the crude oil deviates 1·9° to the\r\nleft. The portion passing over at 257°-258° deviates 1·2°, the residue\r\n2° to the left. The optical behaviour is consequently in favour of the\r\nsupposition that the oil is homogeneous. This is corroborated by the\r\nresults of three elementary analyses which lead to the formula C₂₀H₃₂O.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain whether the seed contains a fatty oil, 10\r\ngrammes, powdered with quartz, were exhausted with boiling ether. This\r\ngave upon evaporation 0·583 grm. of a brown viscid residue, almost\r\ndevoid of odour, but of intense pungency. As it was entirely soluble in\r\nglacial acetic acid or in spirit of wine, we may consider it a _resin_,\r\nand not to contain any fatty matter.\r\n\r\nThe seeds, dried at 100° C., afforded us 2·15 per cent. of ash, which,\r\nowing to the presence of manganese, had a green hue.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Grains of paradise are chiefly shipped from the settlements\r\non the Gold Coast, of which Cape Coast Castle and Accra are the more\r\nimportant. Official returns[2435] show that the exports in 1871 from\r\nthis district were as follows:—to Great Britain 85,502 lb., the United\r\nStates 35,630 lb., Germany 28,501 lb., France 27,125 lb., Holland\r\n14,250 lb.—total, 191,011 lb. (1705 cwt.) In 1872 the total shipments\r\namounted to the enormous quantity of 620,191 lb., valued at £10,303; in\r\n1875 only 151,783 lb., valued at £912, were exported.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The seeds are used in cattle medicines, occasionally as a\r\ncondiment, but chiefly, we believe, to give a fiery pungency to\r\ncordials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORCHIDACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALEP.\r\n\r\n_Radix Salep_, _Radix Satyrii_; _Salep_; F. _Salep_; G. _Salepknollen_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—Most, if not all, species of _Orchis_ found in\r\nEurope and Northern Asia are provided with tubers which, when duly\r\nprepared, are capable of furnishing salep. Of those actually so used,\r\nthe following are the more important, namely—_Orchis mascula_ L., _O.\r\nMorio_ L., _O. militaris_ L., _O. ustulata_ L., _O. pyramidalis_ L.,\r\n_O. coriophora_ L., and _O. longicruris_ Link. These species which have\r\nthe tubers _entire_ are natives of the greater part of Central and\r\nSouthern Europe, Turkey, the Caucasus and Asia Minor.[2436]\r\n\r\nThe following species with _palmate_ or _lobed_ tubers have a\r\ngeographical area no less extensive, namely _O. maculata_ L., _O.\r\nsaccifera_ Brongn., _O. conopsea_ L., and _O. latifolia_ L. The last\r\nnamed reaches North-Western India and Tibet; and _O. conopsea_ occurs\r\nin Amurland in the extreme east of Asia.\r\n\r\n[2435] _Blue Book for the Colony of the Gold Coast in 1871._\r\n\r\n[2436] Tchihatcheff enumerates 36 species of _Orchis_ as occurring in\r\nAsia Minor.—_Asie Mineure_, Bot. ii. 1860.\r\n\r\nThe salep of the Indian bazaars, known as _Sālib misrī_, for fine\r\nqualities of which the most extravagant prices are paid by wealthy\r\norientals, is derived from certain species of _Eulophia_, as _E.\r\ncampestris_ Lindl., _E. herbacea_ Lindl., and probably others.[2437]\r\n\r\n=History=—Under the superstitious influence of the so-called _doctrine\r\nof signatures_,[2438] salep[2439] has had for ages a reputation in\r\nEastern countries as a stimulant of the generative powers; and many\r\nEuropeans who have lived in India, although not prepared to admit the\r\nextravagant virtues ascribed to it by Hindus and Mahommedans, yet\r\nregard it as a valuable nutrient in the sick-room.\r\n\r\nThe drug was known to Dioscorides and the Arabians, as well as to the\r\nherbalists and physicians of the middle ages, by whom it was mostly\r\nprescribed in the fresh state. Gerarde (1636) has given excellent\r\nfigures of the various orchids whose tubers, says he, “_our age useth_.”\r\n\r\nGeoffroy[2440] having recognized the salep imported from the Levant\r\nto be the tubers of an orchis, pointed out in 1740 how it might be\r\nprepared from the species indigenous to France.\r\n\r\n=Collection=—The tubers are dug up after the plant has flowered, and\r\nthe shrivelled ones having been thrown aside, those which are plump are\r\nwashed, strung on threads and scalded. By this process their vitality\r\nis destroyed, and the drying is easily effected by exposure to the sun\r\nor to a gentle artificial heat. Though white and juicy when fresh, they\r\nbecome by drying hard and horny, and lose their bitterish taste and\r\npeculiar odour.\r\n\r\nSalep is largely collected near Melassa (Milas) and Mughla (or Moola),\r\nsouth-east of Smyrna, and also brought there from Mersina, opposite the\r\nnorth-eastern cape (Andrea) of Cyprus. The drug found in English trade\r\nis mostly imported from Smyrna. That sold in Germany is partly obtained\r\nfrom plants growing wild in the Taunus mountains, Westerwald, Rhön, the\r\nOdenwald, and in Franconia. Salep is also collected in Greece, and used\r\nin that country and Turkey in the form of decoction, which is sweetened\r\nwith honey and taken as an early morning drink.[2441] The salep of\r\nIndia is produced on the hills of Afghanistan, Beluchistan, Kabul and\r\nBokhara;[2442] the Neilgherry Hills in the south, and even Ceylon are\r\nsaid likewise to afford it.\r\n\r\n[2437] The Indian species of _Eulophia_ have been reviewed by Lindley\r\nin _Journ. of Linn. Soc._ Bot. iii. (1859) 23.\r\n\r\n[2438] See Appendix, Porta.\r\n\r\n[2439] _Salep_ is the Arabic for _fox_, and the drug is called in that\r\nlanguage _Khus yatu’s salab_, i.e. _fox’s testicle_; or _Khus yatu’l\r\nkalb_, i.e. _dog’s testicle_. The word _Orchis_, and the old English\r\nnames _Dogstones_, _Foxstones_, _Harestones_ and _Goatstones_ have all\r\nbeen given in allusion to the form of the tubers.\r\n\r\n[2440] _Mém. de l’Acad. des Sciences_ for 1740. 99.\r\n\r\n[2441] Heldreich, _Nutzpflanzen Griechenlands_, Athen, 1862. 9.\r\n\r\n[2442] Powell, _Economic Products of the Punjab_, Roorkee, i. (1868)\r\n261; Stewart, _Punjab Plants_, Lahore, 1869. 236.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Levant salep, such as is found in the English market,\r\nconsists of tubers half an inch to an inch in length, of ovoid or\r\noblong form, often pointed at the lower end, and rounded at the\r\nupper where is a depressed scar left by the stem; palmate tubers\r\nare unfrequent. They are generally shrunken and contorted, covered\r\nwith a roughly granular skin, pale brown, translucent, very hard and\r\nhorny, with but little odour and a slight not unpleasant taste. After\r\nmaceration in water for several hours, they regain their original form\r\nand volume. German salep is more translucent and gummy-looking, and has\r\nthe aspect of being more trimmed and prepared.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The fresh tuber exhibits on transverse\r\nsection a few outer rows of thin-walled cells rich in starch. These\r\nare followed by parenchyme of elongated colourless cells likewise\r\ncontaining starch, and isolated bundles of acicular crystals of oxalate\r\nof calcium. In this parenchyme, there are numerous larger cells filled\r\nwith homogenous mucilage. Small vascular bundles are irregularly\r\nscattered throughout the tuber. In _Orchis mascula_ and _O. latifolia_\r\nthe starch grains are nearly globular, and about 25 mkm. in diameter.\r\nIn dried salep the cell-walls are distorted and the starch grains\r\nagglomerated.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most important constituent of salep is a\r\nsort of mucilage, the proportions of which according to Dragendorff\r\n(1865) amounts to 48 per cent.; but it is doubtless subject to great\r\nvariation. Salep yields this mucilage to cold water, forming a solution\r\nwhich is turned blue by iodine, and mixes clearly with neutral\r\nacetate of lead like gum arabic. On addition of ammonia, an abundant\r\nprecipitate is formed. Mucilage of salep precipitated by alcohol and\r\nthen dried, is coloured violet or blue, if moistened with a solution of\r\niodine in iodide of potassium. The dry mucilage is readily soluble in\r\nammoniacal solution of oxide of copper; when boiled with nitric acid,\r\noxalic, but not mucic acid is produced. In these two respects, the\r\nmucilage of salep agrees with cellulose, rather than with gum arabic.\r\nIn the large cells in which it is contained, it does not exhibit\r\nany stratification, so that its formation does not appear due to a\r\nmetamorphosis of the cell-wall itself. Mucilage of salep contains some\r\nnitrogen and inorganic matter, of which it is with difficulty deprived\r\nby repeated precipitation by alcohol.\r\n\r\nIt is to the mucilage just described that salep chiefly owes its power\r\nof forming with even 40 parts of water a thick jelly, which becomes\r\nstill thicker on addition of magnesia or borax. The starch however\r\nassists in the formation of this jelly; yet its amount is very small,\r\nor even _nil_ in the tuber bearing the flowering stem, whereas the\r\nyoung lateral tuber abounds in it. The starch so deposited is evidently\r\nconsumed in the subsequent period of vegetation, thus explaining the\r\nfact that tubers are found, the decoction of which is not rendered blue\r\nby iodine. Salep contains also sugar and albumin, and when fresh, a\r\ntrace of volatile oil. Dried at 110° C., it yields 2 per cent. of ash,\r\nconsisting chiefly of phosphates and chlorides of potassium and calcium\r\n(Dragendorff).\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The shipments of salep from Smyrna are about 5000 okkas (one\r\nokka equal to 283·2 lb. avdp. = 128·5 kilogrammes) annually.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Salep possesses no medicinal powers; but from its property of\r\nforming a jelly with a large proportion of water, it has come to be\r\nregarded as highly nutritious,—a popular notion in which we do not\r\nconcur. A decoction flavoured with sugar and spice, or wine, is an\r\nagreeable drink for invalids, but is not much used in England.[2443]\r\n\r\n[2443] As powdered salep is difficult to mix with water, many persons\r\nfail in preparing this decoction; but it may be easily managed by first\r\nstirring the salep with a little spirit of wine, then adding the water\r\n_suddenly_ and boiling the mixture. The proportions are powdered salep\r\n1 drachm, spirit 1½ fluid drachms, water ½ a pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANILLA.\r\n\r\n_Vanilla_;[2444] F. _and_ G. _Vanille_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Vanilla planifolia_ Andrews—Indigenous to the hot\r\nregions (_tierra caliente_) of Eastern Mexico, diffused by cultivation\r\nthrough other tropical countries. The plant, which is rather fleshy\r\nand has large greenish inodorous flowers,[2445] grows in moist, shady\r\nforests, climbing the trees by means of its aërial roots.\r\n\r\n=History=—The Spaniards found vanilla in use in Mexico as a condiment\r\nto chocolate, and by them it was brought to Europe; but it must have\r\nlong remained very scarce, for Clusius, who received a specimen in\r\n1602 from Morgan, apothecary to Queen Elizabeth, described it as\r\n_Lobus oblongus aromaticus_, without being in the least aware of\r\nits native country or uses.[2446] In the _Thesaurus_ of Hernandez\r\nthere is a figure and account of the plant under the name of _Araco\r\naromatico_.[2447]\r\n\r\nIn the time of Pomet (1694) vanilla was imported by way of Spain, and\r\nwas much used in France for flavouring chocolate and scenting tobacco.\r\nIt had a place in the materia medica of the London Pharmacopœia of\r\n1721, and was well known to the druggists of the first half of the 18th\r\ncentury, after which it seems to have gradually disappeared from the\r\nshops. Of late times it has been imported in great abundance, and is\r\nnow plentifully used, not only by the chocolate manufacturer, but also\r\nby the cook and confectioner.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation=—The culture of vanilla is very simple. Shoots about\r\nthree feet long having been fastened to trees, and scarcely touching\r\nthe ground, soon strike roots on to the bark, and form plants which\r\ncommence to produce fruit in three years, and remain productive for\r\nthirty to forty.\r\n\r\nThe fertilization of the flower is naturally brought about by insect\r\nagency. This was practised as early as 1830 by Neumann in the Jardin\r\ndes Plantes at Paris, and in 1837 by Morren,[2448] the director of the\r\nBotanical Garden of Liège, since which the production of the pods has\r\nbeen successfully carried on in all tropical countries[2449] without\r\nthe aid of insects. Even in European forcing houses the plant produces\r\nfruits of full size, which for aroma bear comparison with those of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nIn vanilla plantations the pods are not allowed to arrive at complete\r\nmaturity, but are gathered when their green colour begins to change.\r\nAccording to the statements of De Vriese,[2450] they are dried\r\nby a rather circuitous process, namely by exposing them to heat\r\nalternately uncovered, and wrapped in woollen cloths, whereby they are\r\nartificially ripened, and acquire their ultimate aroma and dark hue.\r\nThey are then tied together into small bundles.\r\n\r\n[2444] Diminutive of the Spanish _vaina_, a pod or capsule.\r\n\r\n[2445] Beautifully figured in Berg and Schmidt’s _Offizinelle\r\nGewächse_, xxxiii. tab. _a_ and _b_ (1862).\r\n\r\n[2446] _Exotica_ (1605) lib. iii. c. 18. 72.\r\n\r\n[2447] _Rerum Medicarum Novæ Hispaniæ Thesaurus_, Romæ, 1651. p.\r\n38.—The original drawing was one of a series of 1200, executed at\r\ngreat cost in Mexico by order of the King of Spain during the previous\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[2448] _Ann. of Nat. Hist._ iii. (1839) 1.\r\n\r\n[2449] In Réunion it was introduced in 1839 by Perrottet, the\r\nwell-known botanist. See Delteil, _Etude sur la Vanille_, Paris, 1874.\r\n54 pages, 2 plates.\r\n\r\n[2450] _De Vanielje_, Leyden, 1856. 22, with figures.\r\n\r\nIn Réunion the drying of the pods is performed since 1857 by dipping\r\nthem previously in boiling water.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fruit when fresh is of the thickness of the little\r\nfinger, obscurely triquetrous, opening longitudinally by two unequal\r\nvalves. It is fleshy, firm, smooth, and plump; when cut transversely\r\nit exudes an inodorous slimy juice, abounding in spiculæ of oxalate of\r\ncalcium.[2451] It is one-celled, with a three-sided cavity, from each\r\nwall of which projects a two-branched placenta, each branch subdividing\r\ninto two backward-curling lobes. There are thus in all 12 ridges, which\r\ntraverse the fruit lengthwise, and bear the seeds. Fine hair-like\r\npapillæ line as a thick fringe the three angles of the cavity, and\r\nsecrete the odorous matter, which after drying is diffused through the\r\nwhole pod. The papillæ likewise contain drops of oil, which is freely\r\nabsorbed by the paper in which a pod is wrapped. That the odorous\r\nmatter is not resident in the fleshy exterior mass we have ascertained\r\nby slicing off this portion of a fresh fruit and drying it separately;\r\nthe interior alone proved to be fragrant.\r\n\r\nThe vanilla of commerce occurs in the form of fleshy, flexible,\r\nstick-like pods, 3 to 8 inches long, and ³/₁₀ to ⁴/₁₀ of an inch wide,\r\nof a compressed cylindrical form, attenuated and hooked at the stalk\r\nend. The surface is finely furrowed lengthwise, shining, unctuous, and\r\noften beset with an efflorescence of minute colourless crystals. The\r\npod splits lengthwise into two unequal valves, revealing a multitude of\r\nminute, shining, hard, black seeds of lenticular form, imbedded in a\r\nviscid aromatic juice.\r\n\r\nThe finest vanilla is the Mexican. _Bourbon Vanilla_, which is the\r\nmore plentiful, is generally shorter and less intense in colour, and\r\ncommands a lower price.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The inner half of the pericarp contains about\r\n20 vascular bundles, arranged in a diffuse ring. The epidermis is\r\nformed of a row of tabular thick-walled cells, containing a granular\r\nbrown substance. The middle layer of the pericarp is composed of large\r\nthin-walled cells, the outer of which are axially extended, while those\r\ntowards the centre have a cubic or spherical form. All contain drops of\r\nyellowish fat and brown granular masses, which do not decidedly exhibit\r\nthe reaction of tannin. The tissue further encloses needles of oxalate\r\nof calcium and prisms of vanillin.\r\n\r\nOn the walls of the outer cells of the pericarp[2452] are deposited\r\nspiral fibres, which occur still more conspicuously in the aërial roots\r\nand in the parenchyme of the leaves of other orchids. The placentæ are\r\ncoated with delicate, thin-walled cells.\r\n\r\n[2451] This juice like that of the squill has an irritating effect on\r\nthe skin, a fact of which the cultivators in Mauritius are well aware.\r\n\r\n[2452] Vanilla grown in Europe is devoid of such cells. We can fully\r\ncorroborate this statement (first made by Berg) from the examination\r\nof very aromatic pods produced in 1871 at Hillfield House, Reigate.\r\nWe have even failed in finding those cells in any vanilla of recent\r\nimportation (1878).\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Vanilla owes the fragrance for which it is\r\nremarkable to _Vanillin_, which is found in a crystalline state in the\r\ninterior or on the surface of the fruit, or dissolved in the viscid\r\noily liquid surrounding the seeds. It was formerly regarded as cinnamic\r\nor benzoic acid, and then as cumarin, until Gobley (1858) demonstrated\r\nits peculiar nature.\r\n\r\nThe admirable researches of Tiemann and Haarmann performed in\r\nHofmann’s laboratory at Berlin (1874-1876) have shown that vanillin is\r\nconstituted according to the formula\r\n\r\n         {OCH₃\r\n    C₆H₃ {OH.\r\n         {CHO\r\n\r\nIt is the aldehyde. It is the aldehyde of methyl-protocatechuic acid,\r\nand like other aldehydes yields a crystallized compound with the\r\nbisulphites of alkalis. This is obtained by shaking an ethereal extract\r\n(_e_) of vanilla, with a saturated solution of bisulphite of sodium.\r\nThe vanillin compound remaining in aqueous solution is mixed with\r\nsulphuric acid and ether; the latter on evaporation affords crystals of\r\nvanillin. They melt at 81°, and may be sublimed by cautiously heating\r\nthem. Vanillin is but sparingly soluble in cold water, and requires\r\nabout 11 parts of it at 100° C. for solution; it strikes a fine dark\r\nviolet with perchloride of iron.\r\n\r\nThe said chemists have further demonstrated that vanillin may be formed\r\nartificially. In the sapwood of pines there occurs a substance called\r\n_Coniferin_, C₁₆H₂₂O₈ + 2 H₂O, first observed in 1861 by Hartig. By\r\nmeans of emulsin coniferin taking up H₂O, can be resolved into sugar\r\nand another crystallizable substance:—C₁₆H₂₂O₈ + H₂O = C₆H₁₂O₆ +\r\nC₁₀H₁₂O₃. The second substance thus derived may be collected by means\r\nof ether, which dissolves neither coniferin nor sugar. By oxidizing it,\r\nor coniferin itself, by bichromate of potassium and sulphuric acid,\r\n_Vanillin_ is obtained. The latter has been for sometime manufactured\r\nin that way by Tiemann, but now eugenol (see p. 285) is used for that\r\npurpose. Another source for vanillin is benzoin (p. 409).\r\n\r\nThe amount of vanillin was stated by Haarmann and Tiemann to be 1·69\r\nper cent. in Mexican vanillin, from 1·9 to 2·48 in the Bourbon variety,\r\nand 2·75 in that from Java. The so-called _Vanillon_ affords only 0·4\r\nto 0·7 per cent. of vanillin.\r\n\r\nFrom the above-mentioned ethereal solution (e), after it has been\r\ndeprived of vanillin, vanillate of sodium may be removed by a dilute\r\nsolution of carbonate of sodium. On acidulating the aqueous solution\r\ncrystals of _vanillic acid_,\r\n\r\n         {OCH₃\r\n    C₆H₃ {OH     are precipitated.\r\n         {COOH\r\n\r\nIf the ether of the solution (_e_), after it has been treated with\r\ncarbonate of sodium, is allowed to evaporate, a mixture of fatty\r\nsubstances and a resin are obtained. The latter has a peculiar odour,\r\nsomewhat suggestive of castoreum; vanillic acid is almost inodorous.\r\n\r\nLeutner (1872) also found in vanilla fatty and waxy matter 11·8, resin\r\n4·0, gum and sugar 16·5 per cent.; and obtained by incineration of the\r\ndrug 4·6 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—The chief seats of vanilla-production in\r\nMexico are the slopes of the Cordilleras, north-west of Vera Cruz,\r\nthe centre of the culture being Jicaltepec, in the vicinity of\r\nNautla.[2453] The finest specimens were contributed in 1878 to the\r\nParis Exhibition from Agapito, Fonticilla, Misantla, Papantla, also\r\nfrom Teziutlan, province of Puebla. There are likewise “_Baynillales_,”\r\nplantations of vanilla, on the western declivity of the Cordilleras\r\nin the State of Oaxaca, and in lesser quantity in those of Tabasco,\r\nChiapas, and Yucatan. The eastern parts of Mexico exported in 1864, by\r\nway of Vera Cruz and Tampico, about 20,000 kilo. of vanilla, chiefly to\r\nBordeaux. Since then the production seems to have much declined, the\r\nimportation into France having been only 6,896 kilo. in 1871, and 1,938\r\nin 1872.[2454]\r\n\r\n[2453] _Culture du vanillier au Mexique_, in the _Revue Coloniale_,\r\nii. (1849) 383-390; also J. W. von Müller, _Reisen in ... Mexico_, ii.\r\n(Leipzig, 1864) 284-290.\r\n\r\n[2454] _Documents Statistiques réunis par l’Administration des Douanes\r\nsur le Commerce de la France_, année 1872, p. 64.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of vanilla in the small French colony of Réunion or\r\nBourbon (40 miles long by 27 miles broad), introduced by Marchant in\r\n1817 from Mauritius, has of late been very successful, notwithstanding\r\nmany difficulties occasioned by the severe cyclones which sweep\r\nperiodically over the island, and by microscopic fungi which greatly\r\ninjured the plant. In 1849 the export of vanilla from Réunion was 3\r\nkilogrammes, in 1877 it reached 30,973 kilogrammes. The neighbouring\r\nisland of Mauritius also produces vanilla, of which it shipped in 1872\r\n7,139 lbs., in 1877 the quantity was 20,481 lbs. There is likewise a\r\nvery extensive cultivation of vanilla in Java.\r\n\r\nVanilla comes into the market chiefly by way of France, which country,\r\naccording to the official statistics, imported in 1871, 29,914 kilo.\r\n(65,981 lbs.); in 1872, 26,587 (58,643 lbs.); in 1874 that quantity\r\namounted to 34,906 kilo.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Vanilla has long ceased to be used in medicine, at least in this\r\ncountry, but is often sold by druggists for flavouring chocolate, ices,\r\ncreams, and confectionery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRIDACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHIZOMA IRIDIS.\r\n\r\n_Radix Iridis Florentinæ_; _Orris Root_; F. _Racine d’Iris_; G.\r\n_Veilchenwurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—This drug is derived from three species of _Iris_,\r\nnamely:—\r\n\r\n1. _Iris germanica_ L., a perennial plant with beautiful large deep\r\nblue flowers, common about Florence and Lucca, ascending to the region\r\nof the chestnut. It is also found dispersed throughout Central and\r\nSouthern Europe, and in Northern India and Morocco; and is one of the\r\ncommonest plants of the gardens round London, where it is known as the\r\n_Blue Flag_.\r\n\r\n2. _I. pallida_ Lam., a plant differing from the preceding by flowers\r\nof a delicate pale blue, growing wild in stony places in Istria. It is\r\nabundant about Florence and Lucca in the region of the olive, but is a\r\ndoubtful native.\r\n\r\n3. _I. florentina_ L., closely allied to _I. pallida_, yet bearing\r\nlarge white flowers, is indigenous to the coast region of Macedonia\r\nand the south-western shores of the Black Sea, Hersek, in the Gulf\r\nof Ismid, and about Adalia in Asia Minor. It also occurs in the\r\nneighbourhood of Florence and Lucca, but in our opinion only as a\r\nnaturalized plant.[2455]\r\n\r\nThese three species, but especially _I. germanica_ and _I. pallida_,\r\nare cultivated for the production of orris root in the neighbourhood of\r\nFlorence. They are planted on the edges of terraces and on waste, stony\r\nplaces contiguous to cultivated ground. _I. florentina_ is seldom found\r\nbeyond the precincts of villas, and is far less common than the other\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n=History=—In ancient Greece and Rome, orris root was largely used in\r\nperfumery; and Macedonia, Elis, and Corinth were famous for their\r\nunguents of iris.[2456] Theophrastus and Dioscorides were well\r\nacquainted with orris root; the latter, as well as Pliny, remarks that\r\nthe best comes from Illyricum, the next from Macedonia, and a sort\r\nstill inferior from Libya; and that the root is used as a perfume and\r\nmedicine. Visiani[2457] considers that _Iris germanica_ is the Illyrian\r\niris of the ancients, which is highly probable, seeing that throughout\r\nDalmatia (the ancient Illyricum) that species is plentiful, and _I.\r\nflorentina_ and _I. pallida_ do not occur. At what period the two\r\nlatter were introduced into Northern Italy we have no direct evidence,\r\nbut it was probably in the early middle ages. The ancient arms of\r\nFlorence, a white lily or iris on a red shield,[2458] seem to indicate\r\nthat that city was famed for the growth of these plants. Petrus de\r\nCrescentiis[2459] of Bologna, who flourished in the 13th century,\r\nmentions the cultivation of the _white_ as well as of the purple iris,\r\nand states at what season the root should be collected for medicinal\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nBut the true Illyrian drug was held to be the best; and Valerius\r\nCordus[2460] laments that it was being displaced by the Florentine,\r\nthough it might easily be obtained through the Venetians.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2455] From observations made at Florence in the spring of 1872, I\r\nam led to regard the three species here named as quite distinct. The\r\nfollowing comparative characters are perhaps worth recording:—\r\n\r\n_I. germanica_—flower-stem scarcely 1½ times as tall as leaves; flowers\r\nmore crowded than in _I. pallida_, varying in depth of colour but never\r\npale blue.\r\n\r\n_I. pallida_—bracts brown and scariose; flower-stem twice as high as\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n_I. florentina_—bracts green and fleshy; flower-stem short as in _I.\r\ngermanica_; is a more tender plant than the other two, and blossoms a\r\nlittle later.—D. H.\r\n\r\n[2456] For further information, consult Blümner, _Die gewerbliche\r\nThätigkeit der Völker des klassischen Alterthums_, 1869. 57. 76. 83.\r\n\r\n[2457] _Flora Dalmatica_, i.

The\r\nstarch of the rhizome was formerly reckoned medicinal, and directions\r\nfor its preparation are to be found in the _Traicté de la Chymie_ of Le\r\nFebvre, i. (1660) 310.\r\n\r\n=Production=—The above-mentioned species of iris are known to the\r\nTuscan peasantry by the one name of _Giaggiolo_. The rhizomes are\r\ncollected indiscriminately, the chief quantity being doubtless\r\nfurnished by the two more plentiful species, _I. germanica_ and _I.\r\npallida_. They are dug up in August, are then peeled, trimmed,\r\nand laid out in the sunshine to dry, the larger bits cut off being\r\nreserved for replanting. At the establishment of Count Strozzi,\r\nfounded in 1806 at Pontasieve near Florence, which lies in the midst\r\nof the orris district, the rhizomes, collected from the peasants\r\nby itinerant dealers, are separated into different qualities, as\r\n_selected_ (_scelti_) and _sorts_ (_in sorte_), and are ultimately\r\noffered in trade either entire, or in small bits (_frantumi_),\r\nparings (_raspature_), powder (_polvere di giaggiolo o d’ ireos_), or\r\nmanufactured into orris peas.\r\n\r\nThe growing of orris is only a small branch of industry, the crops\r\nbeing a sort of side-product, but it is nevertheless shared between\r\nthe tenant and landowner as is usual on the Tuscan System of\r\nhusbandry.[2461]\r\n\r\n[2461] Groves, _Pharm. Journ._ iii. (1872) 229.—We have also to thank\r\nhim for information communicated personally.\r\n\r\nIn the mountainous neighbourhood of Verona, the rhizomes of _Giglio\r\nceleste_ or _Giglio selvatico_, _i.e._, Iris germanica, are collected\r\nand chiefly brought to the small places of Tregnano and Illasi,\r\nnorth-east of Verona. The peasants distinguish the selected long roots\r\n(_radice dritta_), the knotty roots (_radice groppo_) which are used\r\nfor the issue-peas, and the fragments (_scarto_) employed in perfumery.\r\n\r\nSome orris root is also exported from Botzen in southern Tyrol.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—The rootstock is fleshy, jointed and branching,\r\ncreeping horizontally near the surface of the ground. It is formed in\r\nold plants of the annual joints of five or six successive years, the\r\noldest of which are evidently in a state of decay. These joints are\r\nmostly dichotomous, subcylindrical, a little compressed vertically,\r\ngradually becoming obconical, and obtaining a maximum size when about\r\nthree years old. They are 3 to 4 inches long and sometimes more than\r\n2 inches thick. Those only of the current year emit leaves from their\r\nextremities. The rhizome is externally yellowish-brown, internally\r\nwhite and juicy, with an earthy smell and acrid taste. By drying, it\r\ngradually acquires its pleasant violet odour, but it is said not to\r\nattain its maximum of fragrance until it has been kept for two years.\r\n\r\nWe have carefully compared with each other the fresh rhizomes of the\r\nthree species under notice, but are not able to point out any definite\r\ncharacter for distinguishing them apart.\r\n\r\nDried orris root as found in the shops occurs in pieces of 2 to 4\r\ninches long, and often as much as 1¼ inches wide. A full-sized piece\r\nis seen to consist of an elongated, irregularly subconical portion\r\nemitting at its broader end one or two (rarely three) branches which,\r\nhaving been cut short in the process of trimming, have the form of\r\nshort, broad cones, attached by their apices to the parent rootstock.\r\nThe rootstock is flattened, somewhat arched, often contorted, shrunken\r\nand furrowed. The lower side is marked with small circular scars,\r\nindicating the point of insertion of rootlets. The brown outer bark\r\nhas been usually entirely removed by peeling and paring; and the dried\r\nrhizome is of a dull, opaque white, ponderous, firm and compact. It has\r\nan agreeable and delicate odour of violets, and a bitterish, rather\r\naromatic taste, with subsequent acridity.\r\n\r\nA sort of orris root which has been dried without the removal of the\r\nouter peel, is found under the name of _Irisa_ in the Indian bazaars,\r\nand now and then in the London market. It is, we suppose, the produce\r\nof _Iris germanica_ L. (_I. nepalensis_ Wall.), which, according to\r\nHooker, is cultivated in Kashmir. Orris root of rather low quality\r\nis now often imported from Morocco; it is obtained, we believe,\r\nexclusively from _I. germanica_.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—On transverse section, the white bark about\r\n2 mm. broad, is seen to be separated by a fine brown line from the\r\nfaintly yellowish woody tissue. The latter is traversed by numerous\r\nvascular bundles, in diffuse and irregular rings, and exhibits here\r\nand there small shining crystals of oxalate of calcium. It is made up\r\nuniformly of large thick-walled spherical porous cells, loaded with\r\nstarch granules, which are oval, rather large and very numerous; prisms\r\nof calcium oxalate are also visible. The latter were noticed already by\r\none of the earliest microscopic observers, Anton van Leeuwenhoek, about\r\nthe year 1716. The spiral vessels are small and run in very various\r\ndirections. The foregoing description is applicable to any one of the\r\nthree species we have named.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—When orris root is distilled with water, a\r\ncrystalline substance, called _Orris Camphor_, is found floating on\r\nthe aqueous distillate. This substance, which we first obtained from\r\nthe laboratory of Messrs. Herrings & Co. of London, is yielded, as we\r\nlearn from Mr. Umney, to the extent of 0·12 per cent.—that is to say, 3\r\ncwt. 3 qrs. 23 lb. of rhizome afforded of it 8½ ounces.[2462] Messrs.\r\nSchimmel & Co. of Leipzig also presented us with the same substance, of\r\nwhich they obtain usually 0·60 to 0·80 per cent. Orris camphor has the\r\nexquisite and persistent fragrance of the drug; we have proved[2463]\r\nthat this presumed stearoptene or camphor of orris root consists of\r\n_myristic acid_, C₁₄H₂₈O₂ (see page 508), impregnated with the minute\r\nquantity of essential oil occurring in the drug. The oil itself would\r\nappear not to pre-exist in the living root, but to be formed on drying\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBy exhausting orris root with spirit of wine, a soft brownish resin\r\nis obtained, together with a little tannic matter. The resin has a\r\nslightly acrid taste; the tannin strikes a green colour with persalts\r\nof iron.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Orris root is shipped from Leghorn, Trieste and\r\nMogador,—from the last named port to the extent in 1876 of 834\r\ncwt.[2464] There are no data to show the total imports into Great\r\nBritain. France imported in the year 1870 about 50 tons of orris root.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Frequently employed as an ingredient in tooth-powders, and in\r\nFrance for making issue-peas; but the chief application is as a perfume.\r\n\r\n[2462] The produce of some previous operations, in which 23 cwt. of\r\norris was distilled, afforded but little over one-tenth per cent.\r\n\r\n[2463] _Pharm.

It has an elegant\r\npurple flower, with a large orange-red stigma, the three pendulous\r\ndivisions of which are protruded beyond the perianth.\r\n\r\n[2465] The word _Saffron_ is derived from the Arabic _Asfar_, yellow.\r\n\r\nThe Saffron Crocus is supposed to be indigenous to Greece, Asia Minor,\r\nand perhaps Persia, but it has been so long under cultivation in the\r\nEast that its primitive home is somewhat doubtful.[2466]\r\n\r\n=History=—Saffron, either as a medicine, condiment, perfume, or dye,\r\nhas been highly prized by mankind from a remote period, and has played\r\nan important part in the history of commerce.\r\n\r\nUnder the Hebrew name _Carcôm_, which is supposed to be the root of\r\nthe word _Crocus_, the plant is alluded to by Solomon;[2467] and as\r\nΚρόκος, by Homer, Hippocrates, Theophrastus, and Theocritus. Virgil and\r\nColumella mention the saffron of Mount Tmolus; the latter also names\r\nthat of Corycus in Cilicia, and of Sicily, both which localities are\r\nalluded to as celebrated for the drug by Dioscorides and Pliny.\r\n\r\nSaffron was an article of traffic on the Red Sea in the first century;\r\nand the author of the Periplus remarks that Κρόκος is exported\r\nfrom Egypt to Southern Arabia, and from Barygaza in the gulf of\r\nCambay.[2468] It was well known under the name _kunkuma_ to the earlier\r\nHindu writers.\r\n\r\nIt was cultivated at Derbend and Ispahan in Persia, and in Transoxania\r\nin the 10th century,[2469] whence it is not improbable the plant was\r\ncarried to China, for according to the Chinese it came thither from the\r\ncountry of the Mahomedans. Chinese writers have recorded that under the\r\nYuen dynasty (.D. 1280-1368), it became the custom to mix _Sa-fa-lang_\r\n(Saffron) with food.[2470]\r\n\r\nThere is evidence to show that saffron was a cultivated production of\r\nSpain[2471] as early as A.D. 961; yet it is not so mentioned, but only\r\nas an eastern drug, by St. Isidore, archbishop of Seville in the 7th\r\ncentury. As to France, Italy, and Germany, it is commonly said that the\r\nsaffron crocus was introduced into these countries by the Crusaders.\r\nPorchaires, a French nobleman, is stated to have brought some bulbs to\r\nAvignon towards the end of the 14th century, and to have commenced the\r\ncultivation in the Comtat Venaissin, where it existed down to recent\r\ntimes. About the same time, the growing of saffron is said to have been\r\nintroduced by the same person into the district of Gâtinais, south of\r\nParis.[2472] At that period, saffron was one of the productions of\r\nCyprus,[2473] with which island France was then, through the princes of\r\nLusignan, particularly related.\r\n\r\n[2466] Chappellier has pointed out that _Crocus sativus_ L. is unknown\r\nin a wild state, and that it hardly ever produces seed even though\r\nartificially fertilized; and has argued from these facts that it is\r\nprobably a hybrid.—_Bulletin de la Soc. bot. de France_, xx.

(A.D. 1327-1377).[2478] Two centuries later\r\nEnglish saffron was even exported to the Continent, for in a priced\r\nlist of the spices sold by the apothecaries of the north of France,\r\nA.D. 1565-70, mention is made of three sorts of saffron, of which\r\n“_Safren d’Engleterre_” is the most valuable.[2479] It was evidently\r\nproduced in considerable quantities, for in 1682 we find in the tariff\r\nof the “Apotheke” of Celle, Hanover, crocus austriacus optimus, and\r\n_Crocus communis anglicus_.[2480]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the last century (1723-28), the cultivation\r\nof saffron was carried on in what is described by a contemporary\r\nwriter[2481] as—“all that large tract of ground that lies between\r\nSaffron Walden and Cambridge, in a circle of about 10 miles diameter.”\r\nThe same writer remarks that saffron was formerly grown in several\r\nother counties of England. The cultivation of the crocus about Saffron\r\nWalden, which was in full activity when Norden[2482] wrote in 1594, had\r\nceased in 1768, and about Cambridge at nearly the same time.[2483] Yet\r\nthe culture must have lingered in a few localities, for in the early\r\npart of the present century a little English saffron was still brought\r\nevery year from Cambridgeshire to London, and sold as a choice drug to\r\nthose who were willing to pay a high price for it.\r\n\r\nSaffron was employed in ancient times to a far greater extent than\r\nat the present day. It entered into all sorts of medicines, both\r\ninternal and external; and it was in common use as a colouring and\r\nflavouring ingredient of various dishes for the table,. The drug, from\r\nits inevitable costliness, has been liable to sophistication from\r\nthe earliest times. Both Dioscorides and Pliny refer to the frauds\r\npractised on it, the latter remarking—“_adulteratur nihil æquè_.”\r\n\r\nDuring the middle ages the severest enactments were not only made,\r\nbut were actually carried into effect, against those who were guilty\r\nof sophisticating saffron, or even of possessing the article in an\r\nadulterated state. Thus at Pisa, in A.D. 1305, the _fundacarii_, or\r\nkeepers of the public warehouses, were required by oath and heavy\r\npenalties to denounce the owners of any falsified saffron consigned to\r\ntheir custody.[2484] The Pepperers of London about the same period were\r\nalso held responsible to check dishonest tampering with saffron.[2485]\r\n\r\n[2474] Bourquelot, _Foires de la Champagne_, Mém. de l’Acad. des\r\ninscript. et belles-lettres de l’Institut, v.

A _Safranschau_\r\n(Saffron inspection) was established at Nuremberg in 1441, in which\r\nyear 13 lb. of saffron was publicly burnt at the Schönen Brunnen\r\nin that city. In 1444, Jobst Findeker was burnt together with his\r\nadulterated saffron! And in 1456, Hans Kölbele, Lienhart Frey, and\r\na woman, implicated in falsifying saffron, were buried alive. The\r\n_Safranschau_ was still in vigour as late as 1591: but new regulations\r\nfor the inspection of saffron were passed in 1613.[2487] There was also\r\nin the same city a _Gewürzschau_, or Spice-inspection, from 1441 to\r\n1797. Similar inspections were established in most German towns during\r\nthe middle ages.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The flower of the saffron crocus has a style 3 to 4\r\ninches long, which in its lower portion is colourless, and included\r\nwithin the tube of the perianth. In its upper part it becomes yellow,\r\nand divides into three tubular, filiform, orange-red stigmas, each\r\nabout an inch in length. The stigmas expand towards their ends, and\r\nthe tube of which they consist is toothed at the edge and slit on its\r\ninner side. The stigma is the only part officinal, and alone is rich in\r\ncolouring matter.\r\n\r\nCommercial saffron (_Hay Saffron_ of the druggists) is a loose mass of\r\nthread-like stigmas, which when unbroken are united in threes at the\r\nupper extremity of the yellow style. It is unctuous to the touch, tough\r\nand flexible; of a deep orange-red, peculiar aromatic smell, and bitter\r\nand rather pungent taste. It is hygroscopic and not easily pulverized;\r\nit loses by drying at 100° C. about 12 per cent. of moisture, which it\r\nquickly reabsorbs.[2488]\r\n\r\n[2486] De la Mare, _Traité de la Police_, Paris, iii. (1719) 428.\r\n\r\n[2487] J. F. Roth, _Geschichte des Nürnbergischen Handels_, 1800-1802,\r\niv. 221.\r\n\r\n[2488] Eight lots of saffron weighing _in toto_ 61 lb., dried at\r\nvarious times during the course of nine years, lost 7 lb. 2¼ oz.,\r\n_i.e._ 11·7 per cent.—(Laboratory records of Messrs. Allen & Hanburys,\r\nPlough Court, Lombard Street.)\r\n\r\nThe colouring power of saffron is very remarkable: we have found that\r\na single grain rubbed to fine powder with a little sugar will impart a\r\ndistinct tint of yellow to 700,000 grains (10 gallons) of water.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The tissue of the stigma consists of very thin,\r\nsinuous, closely-felted, thread-shaped cells, and small spiral vessels.\r\nThe yellow colouring matter penetrates the whole, and is partly\r\ndeposited in granules. The microscope likewise exhibits oil-drops, and\r\nsmall lumps, probably of a solid fat. Large isolated pollen grains are\r\nalso present.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The splendid colouring matter of saffron has\r\nlong been known as _Polychroit_; but in 1851 Quadrat, who instituted\r\nsome fresh researches on the drug, gave it the name of _Crocin_, which\r\nwas also adopted in 1858 by Rochleder. Weiss in 1867[2489] has shown\r\nthat it is a glucoside, for which he retains the name of _Polychroit_,\r\nwhile the new colouring matter which results from its decomposition he\r\nterms _Crocin_. It agrees with the _Crocetin_ of Rochleder.\r\n\r\nPolychroit was prepared by Weiss in the following manner: saffron was\r\ntreated with ether, by which fat, wax, and essential oil were removed;\r\nand it was then exhausted with water. From the aqueous solution,\r\ngummy matters and some inorganic salts were precipitated by strong\r\nalcohol. After the separation of these substances, polychroit was\r\nprecipitated by addition of ether. Thus obtained, it is an orange-red,\r\nviscid, deliquescent substance, which, dried over sulphuric acid,\r\nbecomes brittle and of a fine ruby colour. It has a sweetish taste,\r\nbut is devoid of odour, readily soluble in spirit of wine or water,\r\nand sparingly in absolute alcohol. By dilute acids, it is decomposed\r\ninto _Crocin_, sugar, and an aromatic volatile oil having the smell of\r\nsaffron. Weiss gives the following formula for this decomposition:—\r\n\r\n    C₄₈H₆₀O₁₈ + H₂O = 2(C₁₆H₁₈O₆)  ·  C₁₀H₁₄O  ·  C₆H₁₂O₆.\r\n         polychroit     crocin    essential oil   sugar\r\n\r\n_Crocin_ is a red powder, insoluble in ether, easily soluble in\r\nalcohol, and precipitable from this solution on addition of ether.\r\nIt is only slightly soluble in water, but freely in an alkaline\r\nsolution, from which an acid precipitates it in purple-red flecks.\r\nStrong sulphuric and nitric acids occasion the same colours as with\r\npolychroit; the former producing deep blue, changing to violet\r\nand brown, and the latter green, yellow, and finally brown. It is\r\nremarkable that hydrocarbons of the benzol class do not dissolve the\r\ncolouring matter of saffron.\r\n\r\nThe oil obtained by decomposing crocin is heavier than water; it boils\r\nat about 209° C., and is easily altered,—even by water. It is probably\r\nidentical with the volatile oil obtainable to the extent of one per\r\ncent. from the drug itself, and to which its odour is due.\r\n\r\nSaffron contains sugar (glucose?), besides that obtained by the\r\ndecomposition of polychroit. The drug leaves after incineration 5 to 6\r\nper cent. of ash.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—In France the cultivation is carried on by\r\nsmall peasant proprietors; the flowers are collected at the end of\r\nSeptember or in the beginning of October. The stigmas are quickly taken\r\nout, and immediately dried on sieves over a gentle fire, to which they\r\nare exposed for only half an hour. According to Dumesnil[2490] 7,000 to\r\n8,000 flowers are required for yielding 500 grammes (17½ oz.) of fresh\r\nsaffron, which by drying is reduced to 100 grammes.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the high price of saffron, its cultivation is by no\r\nmeans always profitable, from the many difficulties by which it is\r\nattended. Besides occasional injury from weather, the bulbs are often\r\ndamaged by parasitic fungi as stated by Duhamel in 1728[2491] and again\r\nby Montagne in 1848.[2492]\r\n\r\n[2489] Wiggers and Husemann, _Jahresbericht_ for 1868. 35.\r\n\r\n[2490] _Bulletin de la Société impériale d’acclimatation_, Avril, 1869.\r\n\r\n[2491] _Mém. de l’Acad. des Sciences_, 1728. p. 100.\r\n\r\n[2492] _Etude micrographique de la maladie du Safran, connue sous le\r\nnom de tacon._\r\n\r\nThe most considerable quantity of saffron is now produced in Spain,\r\nnamely in Lower Arragon, in Novelda near Alicante, in the province\r\nAlbacete (Northern Murcia), in La Mancha, near Huelva, and also near\r\nPalma in the island of Mallorca. It is brought into commerce as\r\n_Alicante_ and _Valencia Saffron_. The quantity of saffron exported\r\nfrom Spain in 1864 was valued at £190,062; in 1865, £135,316; in 1866,\r\n£47,083. The drug was chiefly exported to France.[2493]\r\n\r\nFrench saffron, which enjoys a better reputation for purity than the\r\nSpanish, is cultivated in the arrondissement of Pithiviers-en-Gâtinais,\r\nin the department of the Loiret, which district annually furnishes a\r\nquantity valued at 1,500,000 (£60,000) to 1,800,000 francs.[2494] The\r\nexports of France in 1875 were 97,021 kilogrammes, 84,337 of which\r\nbeing imported from Spain.\r\n\r\nIn Austria, Maissau, north-east of Krems on the Danube, still\r\nproduces excellent saffron, though only to a very small extent; the\r\ndistrict was formerly celebrated for the drug. Saffron is produced in\r\nconsiderable quantity in Ghayn, an elevated mountain region separating\r\nWestern Afghanistan from Persia.[2495] A very little of inferior\r\nquality is collected at Pampur in Kashmír, under heavy imposts of\r\nthe Maharaja.[2496] Saffron is also cultivated in some districts of\r\nChina. Finally, the cultivation has been introduced into the United\r\nStates, and a little saffron is collected by the German inhabitants of\r\nLancaster County, Pennsylvania.[2497] But in almost all countries the\r\ncultivation of saffron is on the decline, and in very many districts\r\nhas altogether ceased.\r\n\r\nThe imports of saffron into the United Kingdom amounted in 1870 to\r\n43,950 lb., valued at £95,690. The article is largely exported to\r\nIndia, but there are no general statistics to show the amount. Bombay\r\nimported in the year 1872-73, 21,994 lb., value £35,115.[2498] It is a\r\ncurious fact that now Spanish saffron finds regularly its way to India.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Saffron is of no value for any medicinal effects, and retains\r\na place in the pharmacopœia solely on the ground of its utility as a\r\ncolouring agent. A peculiar preference for it as a condiment exists\r\nin various countries, but especially in Austria, Germany and some\r\ndistricts of Switzerland. This predilection prevails even in England—at\r\nleast in Cornwall, where the use of saffron for colouring cakes is\r\nstill common. Saffron is largely used by the natives of India in\r\nreligious rites, in medicine and for the colouring and flavouring of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nAs a dye-stuff saffron is no longer employed, at least in this country,\r\nits use having been superseded by less costly substances.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Saffron is often adulterated, but the frauds practised\r\non it are not difficult of detection. Sometimes the falsification\r\nconsists in the addition of florets of _Calendula_ dyed with logwood,\r\nor of safflower, or the _stamens_ of the saffron crocus, any of which\r\nmay be detected if a small pinch of the drug be dropped on the surface\r\nof warm water, when the peculiar form of the saffron stigma will at\r\nonce become evident.\r\n\r\n[2493] _Statistical Tables relating to Foreign Countries_ (Blue Book)\r\n1870. 286. 289.\r\n\r\n[2494] Dumesnil, _l. c._\r\n\r\n[2495] Bellew, _From the Indus to the Tigris_, Lond. 1874. 304.\r\n\r\n[2496] Hügel, _Kaschmir_, ii.

If a few shreds of such saffron\r\nbe placed on the surface of water in a wineglass and gently stirred,\r\nthe water will _immediately_ become turbid, and the carbonate of\r\nlime will detach itself as a white powder and subside. Saffron thus\r\nadulterated will _freely effervesce_ when dilute hydrochloric acid is\r\ndropped upon it. We have examined Alicante Saffron, the weight of which\r\nhad been increased more than 20 per cent. by this fraudulent admixture.\r\nThe earthy matter employed in sophisticating saffron is said to be\r\nsometimes emery powder, rendered adherent by honey. We have found that\r\nadulterated with carbonate of lime to leave from 12 to 28 per cent. of\r\nash.[2499]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPALMÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEN ARECÆ.\r\n\r\n_Nuces Arecæ vel Betel_; _Areca Nuts_, _Betel Nuts_; F. _Semence ou\r\nNoix d’Arec_; G. _Arekanüsse_, _Betelnüsse_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Areca Catechu_ L., a most elegant palm,[2500] with\r\na straight smooth trunk, 40 to 50 feet high and about 20 inches in\r\ncircumference. The inflorescence is arranged on a branching spadix,\r\nwith the male flowers on its upper portion and the female near its\r\nbase. The tree is cultivated in the Malayan Archipelago, the warmer\r\nparts of the Indian Peninsula, Ceylon, Indo-China and the Phillippines.\r\nIt is probably indigenous to the first-named region.\r\n\r\n=History=—The Areca palm is mentioned in the Sanskrit writings as\r\n_Guvāca_. It is called in Chinese _Pin-lang_, a name apparently derived\r\nfrom _Pinang_, a designation for the tree in the Malay Islands, whence\r\nthe Chinese anciently derived their supply of the seeds. The oldest\r\nChinese work to mention the _pin-lang_ is the _San-fu-huang-tu_, a\r\ndescription of Chang-an, the capital of the Emperor Wu-ti, B.C. 140-86.\r\nIt is there stated that after the conquest of Yunnan, B.C. 111, some\r\nremarkable trees and plants of the south were taken to the capital, and\r\namong them more than 100 _pin-lang_, which were planted in the imperial\r\ngardens. Bretschneider,[2501] to whose researches we are indebted for\r\nthis information, cites several other Chinese works, from the first\r\ncentury downwards, showing that areca nuts were brought from the then\r\nunsubdued provinces of Southern China, the Malayan Archipelago and\r\nIndia. The custom of presenting areca nut to a guest is alluded to in a\r\nwork of the 4th century.\r\n\r\n[2499] _Science Papers_, 368.\r\n\r\n[2500] Bentley and Trimen, _Medic. Plants_, part 21 (1877).\r\n\r\n[2501] _On the study of Chinese botanical works_, Foochow, 1870. 27.\r\n\r\nThe Arabian writers, as for instance Ibn Batuta, were well acquainted\r\nwith the areca nut, which they called _Fófal_, and with the Indian\r\ncustom of masticating it with lime.\r\n\r\nAreca nut, though held in great estimation among Asiatics as a\r\nmasticatory, and supposed to strengthen the gums, sweeten the breath\r\nand improve digestion, has not until recently been regarded as\r\npossessing any particular medicinal powers beyond those of a mild\r\nastringent.[2502] It has often been administered as a vermifuge to\r\ndogs, and in India and China is given with the same intent to the human\r\nsubject. Some successful trials recently made of it for the expulsion\r\nof tapeworm have led to it being included in the _Additions to the\r\nBritish Pharmacopœia of 1867_, published in 1874.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The areca palm produces a smooth ovoid fruit, of the\r\nsize of a small hen’s egg, slightly pointed at its upper end, and\r\ncrowned with the remains of the stigmas. Its exterior consists of a\r\nthick pericarp, at first fleshy, but, when quite mature, composed of\r\nfine stringy fibres running lengthwise, with much coarser ones below\r\nthem. This fibrous coat is consolidated into a thin crustaceous shell\r\nor endocarp, which surrounds the solitary seed. The latter has the\r\nshape of a very short rounded cone, scarcely an inch in height; it\r\nis depressed at the centre of the base, and has frequently a tuft of\r\nfibres on one side of the depression, indicating its connexion with\r\nthe pericarp. The testa, which seems to be partially adherent to the\r\nendocarp, is obscurely defined, and inseparable from the nucleus.\r\nIts surface is conspicuously marked with a network of veins, running\r\nchiefly from the hilum. When a seed is split open, it is seen that\r\nthese veins extend downwards into the white albumen, reaching almost to\r\nits centre, thus giving the seed a strong resemblance both in structure\r\nand appearance to a nutmeg. The embryo, which is small and conical, is\r\nseated at the base of the seed. Areca nuts are dense and ponderous, and\r\nvery difficult to break or cut. They have when freshly broken a weak\r\ncheesy odour, and taste slightly astringent.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The white horny albumen is made up of large\r\nthick-walled cells, loaded with an albuminoid matter, which on addition\r\nof iodine assumes a brown hue. The cell-walls display large pores,\r\nthe structure of which, after boiling in caustic ley, becomes clearly\r\nevident in polarized light. The brown tissue which runs into the\r\nalbumen is of loose texture, and resembles the corresponding structure\r\nin a nutmeg. The thin walls of its cells are marked with fine spiral\r\nstriations, and in this tissue, as well as on the brown surface of the\r\nseed, delicate spiral vessels are scattered. All the brown cells assume\r\na rich red if moistened with caustic ley, and a dingy green with ferric\r\nchloride.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—We have exhausted the powder of the seeds,\r\npreviously dried at 100° C., with ether; and thereby obtained a\r\n_colourless_ solution, which after evaporation left an oily liquid,\r\nconcreting on cooling. This fatty matter, representing 14 per cent.\r\nof the seed, was thoroughly crystalline and melted at 39° C. By\r\nsaponification we obtained from it a crystalline fatty acid fusing at\r\n41° C., which may consequently be a mixture of lauric and myristic\r\nacids. Some of the fatty matter was boiled with water: the water\r\non evaporation afforded an extremely small trace of tannin but no\r\ncrystals, which had catechin been present should have been left.\r\n\r\n[2502] J. J. Berlu, _The Treasury of Drugs Unlocked_, London, 1724, no\r\ndoubt had before him the areca nuts in speaking of “_Nuces indicæ_ (see\r\nalso p. 503, note 2), like a nutmeg in shape, in chewing turns red; it\r\nis said they will make one drunk ... but I could never find it.”\r\n\r\nThe powdered seeds which had been treated with ether were then\r\nexhausted by cold spirit of wine (·832), which afforded 14·77 per\r\ncent. (reckoned on the original seeds) of a red amorphous _tannic\r\nmatter_, which after drying, proved to be but little soluble in water,\r\nwhether cold or boiling. Submitting to destructive distillation, it\r\nafforded _Pyrocatechin_. Its aqueous solution is not altered by ferrous\r\nsulphate, unless an alkali is added, when it assumes a violet hue, with\r\nseparation of a copious dark purplish precipitate. On addition of a\r\nferric salt in minute quantity to the aqueous solution of the tannic\r\nmatter, a fine green tint is produced, quickly turning brown by a\r\nfurther addition of the test, and violet by an alkali. An abundant dark\r\nprecipitate is also formed.\r\n\r\nThe seeds having been exhausted by both ether and spirit of wine,\r\nwere treated with water, which removed from them chiefly mucilage\r\nprecipitable by alcohol. The alcohol thus used afforded on filtration\r\ntraces of an acid, the examination of which was not pursued. After\r\nexhaustion with ether, spirit of wine and water, a dark brown solution\r\nis got by digesting the residue in ammonia: from this solution, an\r\nacid throws down an abundant brown precipitate, not soluble even in\r\nboiling alcohol. We have not been able to obtain crystals from an\r\naqueous decoction of the seeds, nor by exhausting them directly with\r\nboiling spirit of wine. We have come therefore to the conclusion that\r\n_Catechin_ (p. 243) is not a constituent of areca nuts, and that any\r\nextract, if ever made from them, must be essentially different to the\r\n_Catechu of Acacia_ or of _Nauclea_, and rather to be considered a kind\r\nof tannic matter of the nature of _Ratanhia-red_ or _Cinchona-red_.\r\n\r\nBy incinerating the powdered seeds, 2·26 per cent. were obtained of\r\na brown ash, which, besides peroxide of iron, contained phosphate of\r\nmagnesium.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Areca nuts are sold in India both in the husk (pericarp)\r\nand without it, and the two sorts are enumerated in the Customs\r\nReturns under distinct heads. Their widespread consumption in the East\r\ngives rise to an enormous trade, of which some notion may be formed\r\nby a consideration of the few statistics bearing upon it which are\r\naccessible.\r\n\r\nThus, Ceylon exported of areca nuts in the year 1871, 66,543 cwt.,\r\nvalue £62,593; in 1872, 71,715 cwt.,—the latter quantity entirely to\r\nIndia; in 1875 of the total export of 94,567 cwt. 86,446 were shipped\r\nto India.[2503]\r\n\r\nThe Madras Presidency largely trades in the same commodity. In the year\r\n1872-1873 there were shipped thence to Bombay 43,958 cwt., besides\r\nabout two millions of the entire fruit.[2504] An extensive traffic in\r\nareca nuts is carried on at Singapore and especially in Sumatra.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Powdered areca nut may be given for the expulsion of tapeworm\r\nin the dose of 4 to 6 drachms, taken in milk. The remedy should be\r\nadministered to the patient after a fast of about twelve hours; some\r\nrecommend the previous exhibition of a purgative. It is said to be\r\nefficacious against _lumbricus_ as well as _tænia_.\r\n\r\nThe charcoal afforded by burning areca nuts in a close vessel is\r\nsold as a tooth powder; but except greater density, it possesses no\r\nadvantage over the charcoal from ordinary wood.\r\n\r\n[2503] Ceylon Blue Books.\r\n\r\n[2504] From the returns quoted at p. 571, note 5.\r\n\r\nAs a masticatory areca nut is chewed with a little lime and a leaf of\r\nthe Betel Pepper, _Piper Betle_ L. The nut for this purpose is used in\r\na young and tender state, or is prepared by boiling in water; it is\r\nsometimes combined with aromatics, as camphor or cardamom.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANGUIS DRACONIS.\r\n\r\n_Resina Draconis_; _Dragons Blood_; F. _Sang-dragon_; G. _Drachenblut_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Calamus Draco_[2505] Willd. (_Dæmonorhops Draco_\r\nMart.)—This is one of the Rotang or Rattan Palms, remarkable for their\r\nvery long flexible stems, which climb among the branches of trees by\r\nmeans of spines on the leafstalk. The species under notice, called in\r\nMalay _Rotang Jernang_, grows in swampy forests of the Residency of\r\nPalembang and in the territory of Jambi, in Eastern Sumatra, and in\r\nSouthern Borneo, which regions furnish the dragon’s blood of commerce.\r\nIt is said to occur also in Penang and in various islands of the Sunda\r\nchain.\r\n\r\n=History=—The substance which is mentioned by Dioscorides under the\r\nname of Κιννάβαρι, as a costly pigment and medicine brought from\r\nAfrica, and which is also described by Pliny who distinguished it from\r\nminium, was certainly the resin called _Dragon’s Blood_. It was not\r\nhowever that of the Rotang Palm, _Calamus Draco_, or even of any tree\r\nof the Indian Archipelago, but was on the contrary a production of the\r\nisland of Socotra (see p. 675).\r\n\r\nDragon’s blood is, we believe, not named by any of the earlier voyagers\r\nto the India islands. Ibn Batuta, who visited both Java and Sumatra\r\nbetween A.D. 1325 and 1349, and notices their producing benzoin (see\r\np. 404), cloves, camphor, and aloes-wood, is silent about dragon’s\r\nblood. Barbosa, whose intelligent narrative (A.D. 1514) of the East\r\nIndies[2506] is full of reference to the trade and productions of the\r\ndifferent localities he visited, states that aloes and _dragon’s blood_\r\nare produced in Socotra, but makes no mention of the latter commodity\r\nas found at Malacca, Java, Sumatra, or Borneo.\r\n\r\nThe fact we wish to prove is corroborated by the accounts of early\r\ncommercial intercourse between the Chinese and Arabs recently published\r\nby Bretschneider.[2507] From the 10th to the 15th century there was\r\ncarried on between these nations a trade, the objects of which were not\r\nonly the productions of the Arabian Gulf and countries further north,\r\nbut also those of the Indian Archipelago. One of the islands with which\r\nthe Arabs and Persians carried on a great commerce was Sumatra, whence\r\nthey obtained the precious camphor so much valued by the Chinese,\r\nbut not, so far as it appears, the resin dragon’s blood. As to the\r\nproductions brought from Arabia they are enumerated as Ostriches,\r\nOlibanum, Liquid Storax, Myrrh, and _Dragon’s Blood_, besides a few\r\nother articles not yet determined. It is worthy of remark that the\r\nChinese are still the principal consumers of dragon’s blood, though\r\nlike the rest of mankind they have to content themselves with the\r\nplentiful drug of Sumatra and Borneo, instead of the more ancient sort\r\nproduced in Socotra.\r\n\r\n[2505] Beautifully figured by Blume, _Rumphia_, ii. (1836) tab. 131-132.\r\n\r\n[2506] _Description of the Coasts of East Africa and Malabar_ (Hakluyt\r\nSociety), 1866. 30. 191-197.\r\n\r\n[2507] _Knowledge possessed by the Chinese of the Arabs, etc._, 1871.\r\n\r\nThe first clear account of the production of the resin in India is that\r\ngiven by Rumphius, who in his _Herbarium Amboinense_[2508] describes\r\nthe process by which it is collected at Palembang.\r\n\r\n=Production=—The fruit of _Calamus Draco_, which is produced in\r\npanicles in great profusion, is globose and of the size of a large\r\ncherry, clothed with smoothed downward-overlapping scales. These scales\r\nare sub-quadrangular, thick and shell-like, marked with a longitudinal\r\nfurrow; the largest, which are found towards the middle of the fruit,\r\nare 2 lines long by 3 broad. At maturity the fruit is covered with an\r\nexudation of red resin, which encrusts it so abundantly that the form\r\nof the scales can hardly be seen.\r\n\r\nThe resin, which is naturally friable, is collected by gathering the\r\nfruits, and shaking or beating them in a sack, by which process it\r\nis soon separated. It is then sifted to remove from it scales and\r\nother portions of the fruit. By exposure to the heat of the sun or\r\nin a covered vessel to that of boiling water, the resin is so far\r\nsoftened that it can be moulded into sticks or balls, which are\r\nforthwith wrapped in a piece of palm leaf. It is thus that the best\r\ndragon’s blood, or _jernang_, is obtained. An inferior quality is got\r\nby boiling the pounded fruits in water, and making the resin into\r\na mass, frequently with the addition of other substances by way of\r\nadulteration. The foregoing is the account of the manufacture of the\r\ndrug given by Blume.[2509]\r\n\r\n[2508] Pars. v. (1747) 114-115. tab. 58.\r\n\r\n[2509] _Rumphia_, iii. (1847) 9. tab. 131. 132.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Dragon’s Blood is found in commerce chiefly in two forms,\r\nknown respectively as _Reed_ and _Lump_.\r\n\r\n1. _Reed Dragon’s Blood_ (Dragon’s Blood in sticks, _Sanguis draconis\r\nin baculis_). Some of fine quality purchased in London in 1842 is\r\nin sticks 13 to 14 inches in length, and ¾ to 1 inch in diameter,\r\nneatly wrapped in palm leaf, secured by 8 or 9 transverse bands of\r\nsome flexible grass. The average weight of each stick, including\r\nthe enveloping leaf, is five ounces. The resin has evidently been\r\nwrapt up while soft, as the sticks are furrowed longitudinally\r\nby pressure of the surrounding leaf. The smooth surface is of an\r\nintense blackish-brown; when seen in thin splinters the resin appears\r\ntransparent, and of a pure and brilliant crimson. The fractured surface\r\nlooks resinous and rough, is a little porous, and contains numerous\r\nparticles of the scales of the fruit. Rubbed on paper it leaves a red\r\nmark of not very splendid tint. Heated with alcohol it left 20 per\r\ncent. of pulverulent residue consisting chiefly of vegetable matter.\r\nSticks of smaller size are more common.\r\n\r\n2. _Lump Dragon’s Blood_ (_Sanguis draconis in massis_) is imported\r\nin large rectangular blocks or irregular masses. From the fine _Reed\r\nDragon’s Blood_, just described, it differs in containing a larger\r\nproportion of remains of the fruit, including numerous entire scales.\r\nHence it has a coarser fracture, and the fractured surface is less\r\nintense in tint. Its taste is slightly acrid. Exhausted with alcohol it\r\nleaves a residue amounting in the specimen we tested to 27 per cent.\r\n\r\nDragon’s blood is abundantly soluble in the usual solvents of resins,\r\nnamely, the alcohols (even in dilute spirit of wine), benzol,\r\nchloroform, bisulphide of carbon, and the oxygenated essential oils,\r\nas that of cloves. The residue left after the evaporation of these\r\nliquids is amorphous and of the original fine red colour. The drug is\r\nlikewise dissolved by glacial acetic acid as well as by caustic soda;\r\nthe latter solution on addition of an excess of acid yields a dingy\r\nbrown, jelly-like precipitate, which on drying turns dark red like\r\nthe original drug. In ether dragon’s blood is sparingly soluble, and\r\nstill less so in oil of turpentine; but in the most volatile portions\r\nof petroleum, the so-called petroleum ether we find it to be entirely\r\ninsoluble. It has a slightly sweetish and somewhat acrid taste; melts\r\nat about 120° C., evolving the aromatic but irritating fumes of benzoic\r\nacid; boiled with water the resin becomes soft and partially liquid.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Dragon’s blood is a peculiar resin, which\r\naccording to Johnston[2510] answers to the formula C₂₀H₂₀O₄. By heating\r\nit and condensing the vapour an aqueous acid liquid is obtained,\r\ntogether with a heavy oily portion of a pungent burning taste and\r\ncrystals of benzoic acid. The composition of these products has not yet\r\nbeen thoroughly ascertained, but the presence of acetone, _Toluol_,\r\nC₆H₅(CH₃), _Dracyl_ of Glénard and Boudault (1844), and _Styrol_,\r\nC₈H₈ (_Draconyl_), has been pointed out,[2511] the latter perhaps due\r\nto the existence in the drug of metastyrol (p. 274), as suggested by\r\nKovalewsky.[2512] Both these hydrocarbons are _lighter_ than water; yet\r\nwe find that the above oily portion yielded by dry distillation sinks\r\nin water, a circumstance possibly occasioned by the presence of benzoic\r\nalcohol, C₆H₅(CH₂OH).\r\n\r\nAs benzoic acid is freely soluble in petroleum ether it ought to be\r\nremoved from the drug by that solvent: on making the experiment we\r\ngot traces of an amorphous red matter, a little of an oily liquid,\r\nbut nothing crystalline. Cinnamic acid, on the other hand, is always\r\npresent, according to Hirschsohn (1877). As to the watery liquid, it\r\nassumes a blue colour on addition of perchloride of iron, whence it\r\nwould appear to contain phenol or pyrogallol rather than pyrocatechin\r\n(p. 196).\r\n\r\nBy boiling dragon’s blood with nitric acid, benzoic, nitro-benzoic, and\r\noxalic acids are chiefly obtained, and only very little picric acid.\r\n_Hlasiwetz_ and _Barth_ melted the drug with caustic potash, and found\r\namong the products thus formed phloroglucin (p. 243), para-oxybenzoic,\r\nprotocatechuic, and oxalic acids, as well as several acids of the fatty\r\nseries. Benzoin yields similar products.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Dragon’s blood is shipped from Singapore and Batavia. Large\r\nquantities are annually exported from Banjarmasin in Borneo to these\r\nplaces and to China.[2513]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—In medicine, only as the colouring agent of plasters and tooth\r\npowders; in the arts, for varnish.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—Dragon’s blood varies exceedingly in quality,[2514] of\r\nwhich the principal criterion regarded by the dealers is _colour_. Some\r\nof the inferior sorts make only a dull brick-red mark when rubbed on\r\npaper, and have an earthy-looking fracture. The sticks moreover do not\r\ntake the impression of the enveloping leaf as when they are more purely\r\nresinous. A sample of inferior Reed Dragon’s Blood afforded us 40 per\r\ncent. of matter, insoluble in spirit of wine.\r\n\r\n[2510] _Phil.

That the\r\nterm really designated dragon’s blood seems evident from the fact that\r\nthe author of the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea,[2515] written _circa_\r\nA.D. 54-68, names it (Κιννάβαρι) as a production of the island of\r\nDioscorida, the ancient name of Socotra.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians, as Abu Hanifa and Ibn Baytar,[2516] describe dragon’s\r\nblood as brought from Socotra, giving to the drug the very name\r\nby which it is known to the Arabs at the present day, namely,\r\n_Dam-ul-akh-wain_. Barbosa (1514) as well as Giovanni di Barros[2517]\r\nmention it as a production of the island; and in our own times it\r\nhas been noticed by Wellstead,[2518] Vaughan,[2519] and A. von\r\nKremer.[2520] It is now but little collected. Vaughan states, as well\r\nas Von Wrede, that the tree is found in Hadramaut and on the east coast\r\nof Africa. The latter statement is also made in letters (1877, 1878),\r\nwith which we were favoured by Captain Hunter of Aden and Hildebrandt\r\nof Berlin (see pages 140 and 141), by the latter of whom we were\r\npresented with a photographic sketch of the tree growing in the Somali\r\ncountry, at elevations of from 2500 to 5500 feet, and called there\r\nMoli. It is _Dracæna schizantha_ Baker,[2521] a tree attaining 8 metres\r\nin height. The resin has an acidulous taste, and is, according to\r\nHildebrandt, not exported, but occasionally eaten by the Somalis. The\r\ntree from which dragon’s blood is collected in Socotra is, according to\r\nCapt. Hunter, _Dracæna Ombet_ Kotschy.\r\n\r\nThe _Drop Dragon’s Blood_, of which small parcels imported from Bombay\r\nor Zanzibar occasionally appear in the London market, is however this\r\ndrug. It is in small tears and fragments, seldom exceeding an inch in\r\nlength, has a clean glassy fracture, and in thin pieces is transparent\r\nand of a splendid ruby colour. From Sumatran dragon’s blood it may be\r\ndistinguished by not containing the little shell-like scales constantly\r\npresent in that drug, and by not evolving when heated on the point of a\r\nknife the irritating fumes of benzoic acid.\r\n\r\n_Dragon’s Blood of the Canary Islands_—This substance is afforded by\r\n_Dracæna Draco_ L., a liliaceous tree[2522] resembling a _Yucca_,\r\nof which the famous specimen at Orotava in Teneriffe has often been\r\ndescribed on account of its gigantic dimensions and venerable age.[2523]\r\n\r\n[2515] _Voyage of Nearchus and Periplus of the Erythrean Sea_,\r\ntranslated by Vincent, Oxford, 1809. 90.\r\n\r\n[2516] Sontheimer’s ed. i. 104. 426. ii. 117.\r\n\r\n[2517] _L’Asia_, sec. deca.

It has been found in the sepulchral\r\ncaves of the aboriginal inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe name _Dragon’s Blood_ has also been applied to an exudation\r\nobtained from the West Indian _Pterocarpus Draco_ L., and to that of\r\n_Croton Draco_ Schlecht.; but the latter appears to be of the nature of\r\nkino, and neither substance is met with in European commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAROIDEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHIZOMA CALAMI AROMATICI.\r\n\r\n_Radix Calami aromatici_, _Radix Acori_; _Sweet Flag Root_; F. _Acore\r\nodorant ou vrai_, _Roseau aromatique_; G. _Kalmus_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Acorus Calamus_ L., an aromatic, flag-like plant,\r\ngrowing on the margins of streams, swamps, and lakes, from the coasts\r\nof the Black Sea, through Southern Siberia, Central Asia, and India, as\r\nfar as Amurland, Northern China, and Japan; indigenous also to North\r\nAmerica. It is now established as a wild plant in the greater part of\r\nEurope, reaching from Sicily as far north as Scotland, Scandinavia,\r\nand Northern Russia; and is cultivated to a small extent in Burma and\r\nCeylon.\r\n\r\nRegarding the introduction of _Acorus Calamus_ into Western Europe, it\r\nis believed in Poland to have been introduced there in the 13th century\r\nby the Tartars, yet it seems not to have attracted then any attention.\r\nThe well-informed botanist, Bock (Tragus), mentioning the use of the\r\npreserved rhizome by wealthy persons, states[2526] that he had never\r\nseen the plant growing in Germany. Clusius[2527] relates that he first\r\nreceived a living plant in 1574, sent from the lake Apollonia near\r\nBrussa in Asia Minor. Camerarius,[2528] writing in 1588, speaks of it\r\nas introduced some years previously, and then plentiful in Germany,\r\nwhich seems to show a rapid propagation. Gerarde at the close of the\r\ncentury looked upon _Acorus_ as an Eastern plant, which he says is\r\ngrown in many English gardens, and might hence be fitly called the\r\n“_Sweet Garden Flag_.” Berlu,[2529] in 1724, observes of the root\r\nthat—“_it is brought in quantities from Germany_:” hence we may infer\r\nthat it was not then collected in England, as we know it was at a later\r\nperiod.[2530]\r\n\r\n[2524] Ramusio, _Raccolta delle Navigationi et Viaggi_, Venet. i. 97.\r\n\r\n[2525] Kunstmann, _Abhandlungen der Baierischen Akademie der\r\nWissenschaften_, vii.

(1871) 163.\r\n\r\n=History=—Sweet Flag root has been from the earliest times a favourite\r\nmedicine of the natives of India, in which country it is sold in every\r\nbazaar. Ainslie[2531] asserts that it is reckoned so valuable in the\r\nbowel complaints of children that there is a penalty incurred by any\r\ndruggist who will not open his door in the middle of the night to sell\r\nit, if demanded!\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of _Acoron_, a plant of Colchis, Galatia, Pontus, and\r\nCrete, given by Dioscorides and Pliny, certainly refer to this drug. We\r\nthink that the Κάλαμος ἀρωματικός of Dioscorides, which he states to\r\ngrow in India, is the same, though Royle regards it as an _Andropogon_.\r\nThe Κάλαμος of Theophrastus and the _Calamus_ of the English\r\nBible[2532] are considered by some authors to refer to the Sweet Flag.\r\n\r\nCelsus in the first century mentioned _Calamus Alexandrinus_, the drug\r\nbeing probably then brought from India by way of the Red Sea. We know\r\nby the testimony of Amatus Lusitanus[2533] that in the 16th century it\r\nused to be so imported into Venice. Rheede,[2534] moreover, described\r\nand figured _Acorus Calamus_ as an Indian plant under the name _Vacha_,\r\nwhich it still bears on the Malabar Coast. But in the pharmaceutical\r\ntariff of the German town of Halberstadt of the year 1697, “_Calamus\r\naromaticus verus, Indianischer Calmus_” and “_Calamus aromaticus\r\nnostras_,” _common Calmus_, are quoted at exactly the same price,[2535]\r\nand Murray[2536] states expressly that in his time (1790) Asiatic\r\ncalamus was still met with in the pharmacies of Continental Europe, but\r\nthat it had mostly been replaced by the home-grown drug. At the present\r\ntime the _Calamus aromaticus_ of commerce is European; in all essential\r\ncharacters it agrees with that of India, a package of which is now and\r\nthen offered in the London drug sales.\r\n\r\n=Collection=—The London market is supplied from Germany, whither the\r\ndrug is brought, we believe, from Southern Russia. It is no longer\r\ncollected in England,—at least in quantity, though it used to be\r\ngathered some years ago in Norfolk.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The rootstock of sweet flag occurs in somewhat tortuous,\r\nsubcylindrical or flattened pieces, a few inches long, and from ½ to\r\n1 inch in greatest diameter. Each piece is obscurely marked on the\r\nupper surface with the scars, often hairy, of leaves, and on the under\r\nwith a zigzag line of little, elevated, dot-like rings,—the scars of\r\nroots. The rootstock is usually rough and shrunken, varying in colour\r\nfrom dark brown to orange-brown, breaking easily with a short corky\r\nfracture, and exhibiting a pale brown spongy interior. The odour is\r\naromatic and agreeable; the taste, bitterish and pungent.\r\n\r\nThe fresh rootstock is brownish-red or greenish, white or reddish\r\nwithin, and of a spongy texture. Its transverse section is tolerably\r\nuniform; a fine line (medullary sheath) separates the outer tissue from\r\nthe lighter central part, the diameter of which is twice or three times\r\nthe width of the former.\r\n\r\n[2531] _Mat.

The prevailing tissue, both of the\r\nouter and the central part, consists of uniform nearly globular cells,\r\ntraversed by numerous vascular bundles, especially at the boundary\r\nline (medullary sheath). Besides them, the rootstock like that of\r\nmany fresh-water plants, exhibits a large number of intercellular\r\nholes. These air-holes, or more correctly water-holes, are somewhat\r\nlongitudinally extended, so as to form a kind of network, imparting a\r\nspongy consistence[2537] to the fresh rootstock. At certain places,\r\nwhere the series of cells cross one another, especially in the outer\r\npart, there are single cells filled with essential oil,[2538] which\r\nmay be made very conspicuous by adding to sections dilute potash or\r\nperchloride of iron. The other cells are loaded with small starch\r\ngranules; a little mucilage and tannic matter is met with in the\r\nexterior coat.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The dried rhizome yielded us 1·3 per cent. of a\r\nyellowish neutral essential oil of agreeable odour, which in a column\r\nof 50 mm. long, deviates 13·8° to the right. By working on a large\r\nscale, Messrs. Schimmel & Co., Leipzig, obtain 2·4 to 2·6 per cent.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kurbatow (1873), this oil contains a hydrocarbon,\r\nC₁₀H₁₆, boiling at 159° C., and forming a crystalline compound with\r\nHCl, and another hydrocarbon boiling at 255-258° C., affording no\r\ncrystallizable hydrochloric compound. By submitting the oil to\r\nfractional distillation, we noticed, above 250°, a blue portion, which\r\nmay be decolorized by sodium. The crude oil acquires a dark brownish\r\ncolour on addition of perchloride of iron, but is not at all soluble in\r\nconcentrated potash solution.\r\n\r\nThe bitter principle _Acorin_ was extracted by Faust in 1867, as a\r\nsemi-fluid, brownish glucoside, containing nitrogen, soluble both\r\nin ether and in alcohol, but neither in benzol nor in water. In\r\norder to obtain this substance, we precipitated the decoction of 10\r\nlb. of the drug by means of tannic acid, and followed the method\r\ncommonly practised in the preparation of bitter principles. By finally\r\nexhausting the residue with chloroform, we succeeded in obtaining a\r\nvery bitter, perfectly crystalline body, but in so minute a quantity,\r\nthat we were unable to investigate its nature.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Sweet Flag is an aromatic stimulant and tonic, now rarely used\r\nin regular medicine. It is sold by the herbalist for flavouring beer,\r\nand for masticating to clear the voice. It is said to be also used by\r\nsnuff manufacturers.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The rhizome of the Yellow Flag, _Iris Pseudacorus_ L.,\r\nis occasionally mixed with that of the Sweet Flag, from which it may be\r\ndistinguished by its want of aroma, astringent taste, dark colour, and\r\ndissimilar structure.\r\n\r\n[2537] This was possibly alluded to by Albertus Magnus (A.D.\r\n1193-1280), who says:—(Calamus aromaticus)—nascitur in India et\r\nEthiopia sub cancro, et habet interius ex parte concava “pellem\r\nsubtilem, _sicut telæ sunt aranearum_.”—_De Vegetabilibus_, Jessen’s\r\ned. 1867. 376. We suppose the drug under notice was intended.\r\n\r\n[2538] Hence the practice of _peeling_ the rhizome which prevails in\r\nsome parts of the Continent ought to be abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLILIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nALOË.\r\n\r\n_Aloes_; F. _Aloès ou Suc d’Aloès_; G. _Aloë_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—Several species of _Aloë_[2539] furnish a bitter\r\njuice which when inspissated forms this drug. These plants are natives\r\nof arid, sunny places in Southern and Eastern Africa, whence a few\r\nspecies have been introduced into Northern Africa, Spain,[2540] and the\r\nEast and West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe aloes are succulent plants of liliaceous habit with persistent\r\nfleshy leaves, usually prickly at the margin, and erect spikes of\r\nyellow or red flowers. Many are stemless; others produce stems some\r\nfeet in height, which are woody and branching. In the remote districts\r\nof Namaqua Land and Damara Land in Western South Africa, and in the\r\nTranskei Territory and Northern Natal to the eastern, aloes have been\r\ndiscovered which attain 30 to 60 feet in height, with stems as much as\r\n12 feet in circumference.[2541] The following species may be named with\r\nmore or less of certainty as yielding the drug.[2542]\r\n\r\n_Aloë socotrina_ Lam. (_A. vera_ Miller), native of the southern shores\r\nof the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, Socotra, and Zanzibar (?). It is the\r\nsource of the _Socotrine_ and _Moka Aloes_. _A. officinalis_ Forsk. and\r\n_A. rubescens_ DC. are considered to be varieties of this plant. _A.\r\nabyssinica_ Lam. may probably contribute to the aloes shipped from the\r\nRed Sea.\r\n\r\n_A. vulgaris_ Lam. _A. perfoliata_, var. π. _vera_ Linn., _A.\r\nbarbadensis_ Mill., a plant of India and of Eastern and Northern\r\nAfrica, now found also on the shores of Southern Spain, Sicily, Greece,\r\nand the Canaries; introduced in the beginning of the 16th century (or\r\nearlier) into the West Indies. It affords _Barbados_ and _Curaçao\r\nAloes_. _A. indica_ Royle, a plant of the North-west Provinces of\r\nIndia, common in Indian gardens, appears to be a slight variety of\r\n_A. vulgaris_ Lam. _A. litoralis_ König, said to grow in abundance\r\nat Cape Comorin, is unknown to us. Dr. Bidie suggests that it is a\r\nform of the preceding, stunted by a poor saline soil and exposure to\r\nthe sea breeze. Both _A. indica_ and _A. litoralis_ are named in the\r\n_Pharmacopœia of India_.\r\n\r\n_Aloë ferox_ L., and hybrids obtained by crossing it with _A. africana_\r\nMill. and _A. spicata_ Thunberg, _A. perfoliata_ Linn. (_quoad_ Roxb.)\r\nand _A. linguæformis_ are reputed to yield the best _Cape Aloes_.\r\n\r\n_A. africana_ Mill. and its varieties, and _A. plicatilis_ Mill. afford\r\nan extract which Pappe[2543] says is thought to be less powerful.\r\n\r\n[2539] From the Syriac _Alwai_.\r\n\r\n[2540] _Aloë arborescens_, _A. purpurascens_, and _A. vulgaris_ may be\r\nseen luxuriantly growing in Valencia, Granada, Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[2541] Dyer in _Gardeners’ Chronicle_, May 2, 1874, with figures.\r\n\r\n[2542] Good figures of _Aloë africana_, _A. arborescens_, _A. ferox_,\r\n_A. purpurascens_, _A. socotrina_, and _A. vulgaris_ will be found in\r\nthe work _Monographia generis Aloës et Mesembryanthemi_, auctore Jos.\r\nPrincipe de Salm-Reifferscheid-Dyck, Bonnae, 1836-1863. fol.\r\n\r\n[2543] _Floræ Capensis Medicæ Prodromus_, ed. 2, 1857. 41.\r\n\r\n_A. arborescens_ Mill., _A. Commelini_ Willd. and _A. purpurascens_\r\nHaworth are stated to produce a portion of the _Cape Aloes_ of\r\ncommerce.[2544]\r\n\r\nVarious species of _Agave_, especially _A. americana_ L., are largely\r\ngrown, since the first half of the 16th century, in the south of\r\nEurope, and popularly called _Aloë_. All of them are plants of Mexico,\r\nwhile the true aloes are natives of the old world. Botanically the\r\ngenus _Agave_ differs from _Aloë_, in that the former has the ovary\r\n_inferior_, while in the latter it is _superior_. From a chemical point\r\nof view there is also no analogy at all between Aloë and Agave.\r\n\r\n=History=—Aloes was known to the Greeks as a production of the island\r\nof Socotra as early as the 4th century B.C., if we might credit a\r\nremarkable legend thus given in the writings of the Arabian geographer\r\nEdrisi.[2545] When Alexander had conquered the king of the Persians\r\nand his fleets had vanquished the islands of India, and he had killed\r\nPour, king of the Indies, his master Aristotle recommended him to\r\nseek the island that produces _Aloes_. So when he had finished his\r\nconquests in India, he returned by way of the Indian Sea into that of\r\nOman, conquered the isles therein, and arrived at last at Socotra,\r\nof which he admired the fertility and the climate. And from the\r\nadvice which Aristotle gave him he determined to remove the original\r\ninhabitants and to put Greeks in their place, enjoining the latter to\r\npreserve carefully the plant yielding aloes, on account of its utility,\r\nand because that without it certain sovereign remedies could not be\r\ncompounded. He thought also that the trade in and use of this noble\r\ndrug would be a great advantage for all people. So he took away the\r\noriginal people of the island of Socotra, and established in their\r\nstead a colony of Ionians, who remained under his protection and that\r\nof his successors, and acquired great riches, until the period when the\r\nreligion of the Messiah appeared, which religion they embraced. They\r\nthen became Christians, and so their descendants have remained up to\r\nthe present time (_circa_ A.D. 1154).\r\n\r\nThis curious account, which Yule[2546] says is doubtless a fable,\r\nbut invented to account for facts, is alluded to by the Mahomedan\r\ntravellers of the 9th century[2547] and in the 10th by Masudi,[2548]\r\nwho says that in his time aloes was produced only in the island of\r\nSocotra, where its manufacture had been _improved_ by Greeks sent\r\nthither by Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\nAloes is not mentioned by Theophrastus, but appears to have been well\r\nknown to Celsus, Dioscorides, Pliny and the author of the Periplus of\r\nthe Erythrean Sea, as well as to the later Greek[2549] and the Arabian\r\nphysicians. From the notices of it in the Anglo-Saxon leech-books and a\r\nreference to it as one of the drugs recommended to Alfred the Great by\r\nthe Patriarch of Jerusalem, we may infer that its use was not unknown\r\nin Britain as early as the 10th century.[2550]\r\n\r\n[2544] In the above revision of the medicinal species of _Aloë_ we\r\nhave made free use of the observations on the same subject mentioned\r\nin the _Dictionnaire de Botanique_. We have also had the advantage of\r\nconsulting W. Wilson Saunders, Esq., F.R.S., whose long familiarity\r\nwith these plants in cultivation impart great weight to his opinion.\r\n\r\n[2545] _Géographie d’Edrisi_, i.

After the discovery of\r\na route to India by the Cape of Good Hope the old line of commerce\r\nprobably began to change.\r\n\r\nPires, an apothecary at Cochin, in a letter on Eastern drugs[2551]\r\naddressed to Manuel, king of Portugal, in 1516, reports that aloes\r\ngrows in the island of Çacotora, Aden, Cambaya, Valencia of Arragon,\r\nand in other parts,—the most esteemed being that of Çacotora, and next\r\nis that of Spain; while the drug of Aden and Cambaya is so bad as to be\r\nworthless.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the 17th century there was a direct trade in aloes\r\nbetween England and Socotra; and in the records of the East India\r\nCompany there are many notices of the drug being bought of the “King of\r\nSocotra.” Frequently the king’s whole stock of aloes is mentioned as\r\nhaving been purchased.[2552]\r\n\r\nWellstead, who travelled in Socotra in 1833,[2553] says that in old\r\ntimes the aloë was far more largely grown there than at present, and\r\nthat the walls which enclosed the plantations may still be seen. He\r\nadds that the produce was a monopoly of the Sultan of the island. At\r\nthe present day the few productions of Socotra that are exported are\r\ncarried by the Arab coasting vessels, coming annually from the Persian\r\nGulf to Zanzibar, at which place they are transshipped for Indian and\r\nother ports. Dr. Kirk, who has resided at Zanzibar from 1866 to 1873,\r\ninforms us that aloes from Socotra arrives in a very soft state packed\r\nin goatskins. From these it is transferred to wooden boxes, in which\r\nit concretes, and is shipped to Europe and America. To avoid loss the\r\nskins have to be washed; and the aloetic liquor evaporated.\r\n\r\nLigon,[2554] who visited the island of Barbados in 1647-50, that is\r\nabout twenty years after the arrival of the first settlers, speaks of\r\nthe aloë as if it were indigenous, mentioning also the useful plants\r\nwhich had been introduced. At that period the settlers knew how to\r\nprepare the juice for medicinal use, but had not begun to export it.\r\nBarbados aloes was in the drug warehouses of London in 1693.[2555]\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of aloes in the Cape Colony of South Africa was\r\nobserved by Thunberg in 1773 on the farm of a boer named Peter de Wett,\r\nwho was the first to prepare the drug in that country.[2556] Cape Aloes\r\nis enumerated in the stock of a London druggist in 1780, its cost being\r\nset down as £10 per cwt. (1_s._ 9½_d._ per lb.).\r\n\r\nA new and distinct sort of aloes, manufactured in the colony of Natal,\r\nappeared in English commerce in 1870. It will be described further on.\r\n\r\n_Lignum Aloes_—It is important to bear in mind that the word _Aloes_\r\nor _Lign Aloës_, in Latin _Lignum Aloës_, is used in the Bible and in\r\nmany ancient writings to designate a substance totally distinct from\r\nthe modern _Aloes_, namely the resinous wood of _Aquilaria Agallocha_\r\nRoxburgh, a large tree[2557] of the order Thymeleaceæ, growing in the\r\nMalayan Peninsula. Its wood constituted a drug[2558] which was, down\r\nto the beginning of the present century, generally valued for use as\r\nincense, but now esteemed only in the East.\r\n\r\n[2551] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[2552] _Calendar of State Papers_, Colonial Series, East Indies, China\r\nand Japan, 1513-1616, Lond. 1862.\r\n\r\n[2553] _Journ. of the Roy.

Their interior substance\r\nis formed of very loose, large-celled, colourless pulp, traversed\r\nby vascular bundles, which, on transverse section, are seen to be\r\naccompanied by a group of large thin-walled cells[2559] containing the\r\nbitter juice which constitutes the drug under notice. These cells, on a\r\nlongitudinal section, are seen to be considerably elongated, adjoining\r\na single row of smaller, prismatic, truncated cells,[2560] by which\r\nthe former are separated from the cortical layer. The prismatic cells\r\ncontain a yellow juice, apparently different from that which yields\r\naloes. The cortical tissue is filled with granules of chlorophyll,\r\nand exhibits between the cells groups of needles of calcium oxalate.\r\nSimilar crystals are also found sparingly in the pulp.\r\n\r\nThe transparent pulp-tissue[2561] is rich in mucilage, which after\r\ndilution with water is precipitated by neutral acetate of lead, but is\r\nnot coagulated by boiling.\r\n\r\nThe amount of bitter principles in the leaf probably varies with the\r\nage of the latter and with the season of the year. Haaxman mentions\r\nthat, in Curaçao, the maximum is found when the leaves are changing\r\nfrom green to brown.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation and Manufacture=—In Barbados,[2562] where _Aloë vulgaris_\r\nis systematically cultivated for the production of the drug, the\r\nplants are set 6 inches apart, in rows which are 1 to 1½ foot asunder,\r\nthe ground having been carefully prepared and manured. They are kept\r\nfree from grass and weeds, but yams or pulse are frequently grown\r\nbetween them. The plants are always dwarf, never in the least degree\r\narborescent; almost all of those above a year old bear flowers, which\r\nbeing bright yellow, have a beautiful effect. The leaves are 1-2 feet\r\nlong; they are cut annually, but this does not destroy the plant,\r\nwhich, under good cultivation, lasts for several years.\r\n\r\n[2559] The cells lettered _e_ in Berg’s figure C, plate iv. _f._ of his\r\n“_Offizinelle Gewächse_.”\r\n\r\n[2560] The cells _d_, in Berg’s figure.\r\n\r\n[2561] This central pulpy tissue is _quite tasteless_, and is actually\r\nused as food in times of scarcity in some parts of India.—Stewart,\r\n_Punjab Plants_, 1869. 232.\r\n\r\n[2562] For the particulars we here give respecting Barbados aloes,\r\nwe have cordially to thank Sir R. Bowcher Clarke, Chief Justice of\r\nBarbados, and also Major-General Munro, stationed (1874) at Barbados in\r\ncommand of troops.\r\n\r\nThe cutting takes place in March and April, and is performed in the\r\nheat of the day. The leaves are cut off close to the plant, and placed\r\n_very quickly_, the cut end downwards, in a V-shaped wooden trough,\r\nabout 4 feet long and 12 to 18 inches deep. This is set on a sharp\r\nincline, so that the juice which trickles from the leaves very rapidly\r\nflows down its sides, and finally escapes by a hole at its lower end\r\ninto a vessel placed beneath. No pressure of any sort is applied to\r\nthe leaves. It takes about a quarter of an hour to cut leaves enough\r\nto fill a trough. The troughs are so distributed as to be easily\r\naccessible to the cutters. Their number is generally five; and by the\r\ntime the fifth is filled, the cutters return to the first and throw\r\nout the leaves, which they regard as exhausted. The leaves are neither\r\ninfused nor boiled, nor is any use afterwards made of them except for\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\nWhen the vessels receiving the juice become filled, the latter is\r\nremoved to a cask and reserved for evaporation. This may be done at\r\nonce, or it may be delayed for weeks or even months, the juice, it\r\nis said, not fermenting or spoiling. The evaporation is generally\r\nconducted in a copper vessel; at the bottom of this is a large ladle,\r\ninto which the impurities sink, and are from time to time removed\r\nas the boiling goes on. As soon as the inspissation has reached the\r\nproper point, which is determined solely by the experienced eye of the\r\nworkman, the thickened juice is poured into large gourds or into boxes,\r\nand allowed to harden.\r\n\r\nThe drug is not always readily saleable in the island, but is usually\r\nbought up by speculators who keep it till there is a demand for it in\r\nEngland. The cultivators are small proprietors, but little capable as\r\nto mind or means of making experiments to improve the manufacture of\r\nthe drug. It is said, however, that occasionally a little aloes of very\r\nsuperior kind is made for some special purpose by exposing the juice\r\nin a shallow vessel to solar heat till completely dry. But such a drug\r\nis stated to cost too much time and trouble to be profitable.[2563]\r\nThe manufacture of aloes in the Dutch West Indian island of Curaçao is\r\nconducted in the same manner.[2564]\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of aloes in the Cape Colony has been thus described to\r\nus in a letter[2565] from Mr. Peter MacOwan of Gill College, Somerset\r\nEast:—The operator scratches a shallow dish-shaped hollow in the dry\r\nground, spreads therein a goatskin, and then proceeds to arrange around\r\nthe margin a radial series of aloë leaves, the cut ends projecting\r\ninwards. Upon this, a second series is piled, and then a third—care\r\nbeing taken that the ends of each series overhang sufficiently, to drop\r\nclear into the central hollow. When these preparations have been made,\r\nthe operator either “loafs about” after wild honey, or, more likely,\r\nlies down to sleep. The skin being nearly filled, four skewers run in\r\nand out at the edge square-fashion, give the means of lifting this\r\nprimitive saucer from the ground, and emptying its contents into a\r\ncast-iron pot. The liquid is then boiled, an operation conducted with\r\nthe utmost carelessness. Fresh juice is added to that which has nearly\r\nacquired the finished consistence; the fire is slackened or urged just\r\nas it happens, and the boiling is often interrupted for many hours,\r\nif neglect be more convenient than attention. In fact, the process is\r\nthoroughly barbarous, conducted without industry or reflection; it is\r\nmostly carried on by Bastaards and Hottentots, but not by Kaffirs.\r\n“The only aloë I have seen used,” says Mr. MacOwan, “is the very large\r\none with di-or tri-chotomous inflorescence,—_A. ferox_, I believe.”\r\nBackhouse[2566] also names “_Aloë ferox?_” as the species he saw used\r\nnear Port Elizabeth in 1838.\r\n\r\n[2563] Some extremely fine Barbados aloes in the London market in 1842\r\nwas said to have been manufactured in a vacuum-pan.\r\n\r\n[2564] Oudemans, _Handleiding tot de Pharmacognosie_, 1865. 316.\r\n\r\n[2565] Under date May 7, 1871, addressed to myself.—D. H.\r\n\r\n[2566] _Visit to Mauritius and South Africa_, 1844. 157, also 121.\r\n\r\nFrom another correspondent, we learn that the making of aloes in the\r\nCape Colony is not carried on by preference, but is resorted to when\r\nmore profitable work is scarce. The drug is sold by the farmers to\r\nthe merchants of the towns on the coast, some of whom have exerted\r\nthemselves to obtain a better commodity, and have even imported living\r\naloe-plants from Barbados.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of the manufacture of the so-called _Socotrine_ or\r\n_Zanzibar Aloes_, or even with certainty in what precise localities it\r\nis carried on.\r\n\r\n=General Description=—The differences in the several kinds of\r\ncommercial aloes are due to various causes, such as the species of\r\n_Aloë_ employed and the method of extracting the juice. The drug varies\r\nexceedingly: some is perfectly transparent and amorphous, with a glassy\r\nconchoidal fracture; some is opaque and dark with a dull waxy fracture,\r\nor opaque and pallid; or it may be of a light orange-brown and highly\r\ncrystalline. It varies in consistence in every degree, from dry and\r\nbrittle to pasty, and even entirely fluid and syrup-like.\r\n\r\nThese diverse conditions are partially explained by an examination\r\nof the very fluid aloes that has been imported of recent years from\r\nBombay. If some of this aloes is allowed to repose, it gradually\r\nseparates into two portions,—the upper a transparent, black liquid,—the\r\nlower, an orange-brown crystalline sediment. If the whole be allowed to\r\nevaporate spontaneously, we get aloes of two sorts in the same mass;\r\nthe one from the upper portion being dark, transparent and amorphous,\r\nthe other rather opaque and highly crystalline. Should the two layers\r\nbecome mixed, an intermediate form of the drug results.\r\n\r\nThe _Hepatic Aloes_ of the old writers[2567] was doubtless this rather\r\nopaque form of Socotrine Aloes; but the term has come to be used\r\nsomewhat vaguely for any sort of liver-coloured aloes, and appears to\r\nus unworthy to be retained. Much of the opaque, so-called _Hepatic\r\nAloes_ does not however owe its opacity to crystals, but to a feculent\r\nmatter the nature of which is doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe odour of aloes is a character which is much depended on by dealers\r\nfor distinguishing the different varieties, but it can only be\r\nappreciated by experience, and certainly cannot be described.[2568]\r\n\r\n[2567] As Macer Floridus in the 10th century, who writes:—\r\n\r\n“Sunt Aloës species geminæ, quæ subrubet estque Intus sicut hepar cum\r\nfrangitur, hæc _epatite_ Dicitur et magnas habet in medicamine vires,\r\nUtilior piceo quæ fructa colore videtur.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[2568] Thus the pale, liver-coloured aloes of Natal is invariably\r\nassociated with the transparent Cape Aloes, simply from the fact that\r\nthe two drugs have a similar smell. Again, the aloes of Curaçao is at\r\nonce recognized by its odour, which an experienced druggist pronounces\r\nto be quite different from that of the aloes produced in Barbados.\r\n\r\n=Varieties=—The principal varieties of aloes found in English commerce\r\nare the following:—\r\n\r\n1. _Socotrine Aloes_—also called _Bombay_, _East Indian_, or _Zanzibar\r\nAloes_, and when opaque and liver-coloured, Hepatic Aloes. It is\r\nimported in kegs and tin-lined boxes from Bombay, whither it has\r\nbeen carried by the Arab traders from the African coast, the Red Sea\r\nports, or by way of Zanzibar, from Socotra. When of fine quality, it\r\nis of a dark reddish-brown, of a peculiar, rather agreeable odour,\r\ncomparable to myrrh or saffron. In thin fragments, it is seen to be\r\nof an orange-brown; its powder is of a tawny reddish-brown. When\r\nmoistened with spirit of wine, and examined in a thin stratum under\r\nthe microscope, good Socotrine Aloes is seen to contain an abundance\r\nof crystals. As imported, it is usually soft, at least in the interior\r\nof the mass, but it speedily dries and hardens by keeping.[2569] It is\r\noccasionally imported in a completely fluid state (_Liquid Socotrine\r\nAloes_, _Aloë Juice_), and is not unfrequently somewhat sour and\r\ndeteriorated.\r\n\r\nSome fine aloes from Zanzibar, of which a very small quantity was\r\noffered for sale in 1867, was contained in a skin, and composed of two\r\nlayers, the one amorphous, the other a granular translucent substance\r\nof light colour, which when softened and examined with a lens, was seen\r\nto be a mass of crystals. A very bad, dark, fœtid sort of aloes is\r\nbrought to Aden from the interior. It seems to be the _Moka Aloes_ of\r\nsome writers.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of aloes imported into Bombay in the year 1871-72 was 892\r\ncwt., of which 736 cwt. are reported as shipped from the Red Sea ports\r\nand Aden.[2570]\r\n\r\n[2569] The average loss as estimated in the drying of 560 lb., upon\r\nseveral occasions, was about 14 per cent.—Laboratory statistics,\r\ncommunicated by Messrs. Allen and Hanburys, London.\r\n\r\n[2570] _Statement of the Trade and Navigation of the Presidency of\r\nBombay for 1871-72_, pt. ii. 19.\r\n\r\n2. _Barbados Aloes_—Characteristic samples show it as a hard dry\r\nsubstance of a deep chocolate-brown, with a clean, dull, waxy fracture.\r\nIn small fragments it is seen to be translucent and of an orange-brown\r\nhue. When breathed upon, it exhales an odour analogous to, but easily\r\ndistinguishable from, that of Socotrine aloes. It is imported in\r\nboxes and gourds. The gourds, into which the aloes has been poured in\r\na melted state through a square hole, over which a bit of calico is\r\nafterwards nailed, contain from 10 to 40 lb. or more. Of late years,\r\nBarbados aloes having a smooth and glassy fracture has been imported;\r\nit is known to the London drug-brokers as “_Capey Barbados_.” By\r\nkeeping, it passes into the usual variety having a dull fracture.\r\n\r\nThe export of aloes from Barbados in 1871, as shown by the _Blue Book_\r\nfor that colony, was 1046 cwt., of which 954 cwt. were shipped to the\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\n\r\n3. _Curaçao Aloes_—manufactured in the Dutch West Indian islands of\r\nCuraçao, Bonaire, and Aruba, is imported into this country by way\r\nof Holland, packed in boxes of 15 to 28 lb. each. In appearance it\r\nresembles Barbados aloes, but has a distinctive odour.\r\n\r\n4. _Cape Aloes_—The special features of this sort of aloes are its\r\nbrilliant conchoidal fracture and peculiar odour. Small splinters seen\r\nby transmitted light are highly transparent and of an amber colour;\r\nthe powder is of a pale tawny yellow. When the drug is moistened and\r\nexamined under the microscope, no crystals can be detected, even after\r\nthe lapse of some days. Cape aloes has the odour of other kinds of\r\naloes, with a certain sourish smell which easily distinguishes it.\r\nSeveral qualities are recognized, chiefly by the greater or lesser\r\nbrilliancy of fracture, and by the tint of the powder.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Blue Book_ for the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope, published\r\nat Cape Town in 1873, it appears that the export of aloes in 1872 was\r\n484,532 lb. (4326 cwt.); and that the average market value during the\r\nyear was 3¾_d._, the lowest price, 1½_d._, being at Riversdale and\r\nMossel Bay, and the highest, 11_d._, at Swellendam. The drug is shipped\r\nfrom Cape Town, Mossel Bay and Algoa Bay.\r\n\r\n5. _Natal Aloes_—Aloes is also imported from Natal, and since 1870 in\r\nconsiderable quantity. Most of it is of an hepatic kind and completely\r\nunlike the ordinary Cape aloes, inasmuch as it is of a greyish-brown\r\nand very opaque. Moreover it contains a crystalline principle which has\r\nbeen found in no other sort of aloes.\r\n\r\nThe drug is manufactured in the upper districts of Natal, between\r\nPietermaritzburg and the Quathlamba mountains, especially in the Umvoti\r\nand Mooi River Counties, at an elevation of 2000 to 4000 feet above the\r\nsea. The plant used is a large aloë which has not yet been botanically\r\nidentified. The people who make the drug are British and Dutch\r\nsettlers, employing Kaffir labourers. The process is not very different\r\nfrom that followed in making Cape aloes, but is conducted with more\r\nintelligence. The leaves are cut obliquely into slices, and allowed to\r\nexude their juice in the hot sunshine. The juice is then boiled down in\r\niron pots, some care being taken to prevent burning, by stirring the\r\nliquid as it becomes thick. The drug while still hot, is poured into\r\nwooden cases, in which it is shipped to Europe.[2571] The exports from\r\nthe colony have been as follows:—[2572]\r\n\r\n    1868        1869        1870        1871        1872\r\n    none       38 cwt.     646 cwt.    372 cwt.    501 cwt.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—All kinds of aloes have an odour of the same\r\ncharacter and a bitter disagreeable taste. The odour which is often not\r\nunpleasant, especially in Socotrine aloes, is due to a _volatile oil_,\r\nwhich the drug contains only in minute proportion. T. and H. Smith of\r\nEdinburgh, who contributed a specimen of it to the Vienna Exhibition\r\nof 1873, inform us that they obtained it by subjecting to distillation\r\nwith water 400 lb. of aloes, which quantity they estimate to have\r\nyielded about an ounce. The oil is stated in a letter we have received\r\nfrom them, to be a mobile pale yellow liquid, of sp. gr. 0·863, with a\r\nboiling point of 266-271° C.\r\n\r\nPure aloes dissolves easily in spirit of wine with the exception of a\r\nfew flocculi; it is insoluble in chloroform and bisulphide of carbon,\r\nas well as in the so-called petroleum ether, the most volatile portion\r\nof American petroleum. The sp. gr. of fine transparent fragments of\r\naloes, dried at 100° C., and weighed in the last named fluid at 16° C.,\r\nwas found by one of us (F.) to be 1·364; showing that aloes is much\r\nmore ponderous than most of the resins, which seldom have a higher\r\nsp. gr. than 1·00 to 1·10. In water aloes dissolves completely only\r\nwhen heated. On cooling, the aqueous solution, whether concentrated\r\nor dilute, becomes turbid by the separation of resinous drops, which\r\nunite into a brown mass,—the so-called _Resin of Aloes_.[2573] The\r\nclear solution, after separation of this substance, has a slightly\r\nacid reaction; it is coloured dark brown by alkalis, black by ferric\r\nchloride, and is precipitated yellowish-grey by neutral lead acetate.\r\nCold water dissolves about half its weight of aloes, forming an acid\r\nliquid which exhibits similar reactions. The solution of aloes in\r\npotash or ammonia is precipitated by acids, but not by water.\r\n\r\n[2571] We have to thank J. W. Akerman, Esq., of Pietermaritzburg, for\r\nthe foregoing information as to the manufacture of this drug.\r\n\r\n[2572] _Blue Books for the Colony of Natal for 1868, 1869, 1870, 1871,\r\n1872._\r\n\r\n[2573] The average yield of aqueous extract made by the pharmacopœia\r\nprocess from commercial Socotrine aloes containing about 14 per cent.\r\nof water, was found from the record of five experiments, in which 179\r\nlb. were used, to be 62·7 per cent. Barbados aloes, which is always\r\nmuch drier, afforded on an average 80 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting constituents of aloes are the substances known\r\nas _Aloïn_. This name was originally applied to an aloïn which, as\r\nit appears to be found exclusively in Barbados aloes, is now termed\r\n_Barbaloïn_, in order to distinguish it from allied substances\r\noccurring in Natal and Socotrine aloes.\r\n\r\nBarbaloïn was discovered by T. and H. Smith of Edinburgh in 1851,[2574]\r\nand was described (1851) by Stenhouse. From good qualities of the drug\r\nit can be obtained, according to Tilden,[2575] as a crystalline mass,\r\nto the extent of 20 to 25 per cent., but in others it appears to occur\r\npartly amorphous or in a chemically altered state. Barbaloïn is a\r\nneutral substance, crystallizing in tufts of small yellow prisms. These\r\ncrystals represent _hydrated_ aloïn, and part with one molecule of\r\nwater (=2·69 per cent.) by desiccation _in vacuo_, or by the prolonged\r\nheat of a water-bath. Barbaloïn, C₃₄H₃₆O₁₄ + H₂O, dissolves sparingly\r\nin water or alcohol but very freely if either liquid be even slightly\r\nwarmed; it is insoluble in ether.\r\n\r\nThe solutions alter quickly if made a little alkaline, but if neutral\r\nor slightly acid, are by no means very prone to decomposition. By\r\noxidation with nitric acid, barbaloïn yields, as Tilden (1872) has\r\nshown, about a third of its weight of chrysammic acid, besides aloëtic,\r\noxalic, and picric acids. It easily combines with bromine to form\r\nyellow needles of _Bromaloïn_, C₃₄H₃₀Br₆O₁₄; _Chloraloïn_, C₃₄H₃₀Cl₆O₁₄\r\n+ 6H₂O, crystallizing in prisms, has likewise been obtained.\r\n\r\nIn examining Natal aloes in 1871, we observed it to contain a distinct\r\ncrystalline body, much less soluble than the ordinary aloïn of Barbados\r\naloes. We have accordingly named it _Nataloïn_.\r\n\r\nNataloïn exists naturally in Natal aloes, from which it can be easily\r\nprepared in the crude state, if the drug is triturated with an equal\r\nweight of alcohol at a temperature not exceeding 48° C. This will\r\ndissolve the amorphous portion, from which the crystals should be\r\nseparated by a filter, and washed with a small quantity of cold spirit.\r\nFrom 16 to 25 per cent. of crude nataloïn in pale yellow crystals may\r\nbe thus extracted. When purified by crystallization from methylic\r\nalcohol or spirit of wine, it forms thin, brittle, rectangular scales,\r\noften with one or more of their angles truncated. The formula assigned\r\nto nataloïn by Tilden, which is supported by the composition of the\r\nacetyl derivative he has succeeded in obtaining, is C₂₅H₂₈O₁₁.\r\n\r\nAt 15·5° C., 60 parts of alcohol, 35 of methylic alcohol,[2576] 50 of\r\nacetic ether, 1236 of ether, and 230 of absolute alcohol, dissolve\r\nrespectively one part of nataloïn. It is scarcely more soluble in\r\nwarm than in cold spirit of wine, so that to obtain crystals it is\r\nbest to allow the solution to evaporate spontaneously. Water hot or\r\ncold dissolves it very sparingly. Nataloïn gives off no water when\r\nexposed over oil of vitriol, or to a temperature of 100° C. By the\r\naction of nitric acid, it affords both oxalic and picric acids, but no\r\nchrysammic acid. It appears not to combine with chlorine or bromine,\r\nand we have failed in obtaining from it any such body as bromaloïn.\r\n\r\n[2574] Most beautiful specimens have been presented to each of us by\r\nthese gentlemen.\r\n\r\n[2575] _Pharm. Journ._ April 28, 1872. 845.—See also Nov. 5, 1870. 375.\r\n\r\n[2576] The best crystals can be got by this solvent.\r\n\r\nLiquid Socotrine aloes, imported into London about 1852, was noticed\r\nby Pereira to abound in minute crystals, which he termed the _Aloïn\r\nof Socotrine Aloes_, and regarded as probably identical with that of\r\nBarbados aloes. Some fine dry aloes from Zanzibar of very pale hue, in\r\nour possession, is in reality a perfectly crystalline mass.\r\n\r\nHisted was the first to assert that the crystalline matter of Socotrine\r\nor Zanzibar aloes is a peculiar substance, according neither with\r\nbarbaloïn nor with nataloïn. This observation was fully corroborated\r\nby our own experiments,[2577] made chiefly on the Zanzibar aloes just\r\ndescribed, and we shall call the substance thus discovered _Socaloïn_.\r\nIn this drug, the crystals are prisms of comparatively large size, such\r\nas we have never observed in Natal aloes. They cannot be so easily\r\nisolated as nataloïn, since they are nearly as soluble as the amorphous\r\nmatter surrounding them. Histed recommends treating the powdered crude\r\ndrug with a little alcohol, sp. gr. 0·960, and strongly pressing the\r\npasty mass between several thicknesses of calico; then dissolving\r\nthe yellow crystalline cake in warm weak alcohol, and collecting the\r\ncrystals which are formed by cooling and repose.\r\n\r\nSocaloïn forms tufted acicular prisms, which by solution in methylic\r\nalcohol may be got 2 to 3 millimetres long. It is much more soluble\r\nthan nataloïn. At ordinary temperatures, 30 parts of alcohol, 9 of\r\nacetic ether, 380 of ether, 90 of water are capable of dissolving\r\nrespectively one part of socaloïn; while in methylic alcohol, it is\r\nmost abundantly soluble. Socaloïn is a hydrate, losing when dried over\r\noil of vitriol 11 to 12 per cent. of water, but slowly regaining it if\r\nafterwards exposed to the air. Its elementary composition according to\r\nthe analysis made by one of us (F.) is C₃₄H₃₈O₁₅ + 5 H₂O. We have not\r\nsucceeded in obtaining any well-defined bromine compound of socaloïn.\r\n\r\nThe three aloïns, _Barbaloïn_, _Nataloïn_, and _Socaloïn_, are easily\r\ndistinguished by the following beautiful reaction first noticed by\r\nHisted:—a drop of nitric acid on a porcelain slab gives with a few\r\nparticles of barbaloïn or nataloïn, a vivid crimson,[2578] but produces\r\nlittle effect with socaloïn. To distinguish barbaloïn from nataloïn,\r\ntest each by adding a minute quantity to a drop or two of oil of\r\nvitriol, then allowing the _vapour_ from a rod touched with nitric acid\r\nto pass over the surface. Barbaloïn (and socaloïn) will undergo no\r\nchange, but nataloïn will assume a fine blue.[2579]\r\n\r\n[2577] Flückiger, _Crystalline Principles in Aloes_,—_Pharm. Journ._\r\nSeptember 2, 1871. 195.\r\n\r\n[2578] Rapidly fading in the case of barbaloïn, but permanent with\r\nnataloïn unless heat be applied.\r\n\r\n[2579] These reactions may be sometimes got even with the crude drugs.\r\n\r\nThe researches of E. von Sommaruga and Egger in Vienna (1874) have been\r\ndirected in particular to the aloïn of Socotrine aloes. The melting\r\npoint of this aloïn was found to be between 118° and 120° C., that\r\nof barbaloïn being much higher. The authors conclude that the three\r\nform an homologous series, that their composition may probably be\r\nrepresented thus:—\r\n\r\n    Barbaloïn     C₁₇H₂₀O₇\r\n    Nataloïn      C₁₆H₁₈O₇\r\n    Socaloïn      C₁₅H₁₆O₇\r\n\r\nThey derive in all probability from anthracene, C₁₄H₁₀.\r\n\r\nThe portion of aloes insoluble in cold water was formerly distinguished\r\nas _Resin of Aloes_, from the soluble portion which was called _Bitter\r\nof aloes_ or _Aloëtin_. From the labours of Kossmann (1863), these\r\nportions appear to have nearly the same composition. The soluble\r\nportions treated with dilute sulphuric acid, is said to yield\r\n_Aloëresic_ and _Aloëretic Acids_, both crystallizable, besides the\r\nindifferent substance _Aloëretin_. These observations have not to our\r\nknowledge been confirmed.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown by Tilden and Rammell[2580] that the _Resin of Aloes_\r\nmay by prolonged treatment with boiling water be separated into two\r\nbodies, which they distinguish as _Soluble Resin A._ and _Insoluble\r\nResin B._ With the first it is possible to form a brominated compound,\r\nwhich though non-crystalline is apparently of definite composition. In\r\nthe view of these chemists the _Resin A._ is a kind of anhydride of\r\nbarbaloïn—Barbaloïn, 2(C₃₄H₃₆O₁₄) less H₂O = Aloe Resin A., C₆₈H₇₀O₂₇.\r\nThe resin boiled with nitric acid yields a large amount of chrysammic\r\nacid, together with picric and oxalic acids, and carbonic anhydride.\r\n_Insoluble Resin B._ was found to have nearly the same composition as\r\n_Resin A._\r\n\r\n[2580] _Pharm. Journ._ Sept. 21, 1872. 235.\r\n\r\nAloes treated with various reagents affords a number of remarkable\r\nproducts. Thus, according to Rochleder and Czumpelick (1861) it yields,\r\nwhen boiled with soda-lye, colourless crystals an inch long, which\r\nappear to consist of a salt of _Paracumaric Acid_, together with small\r\nquantities of fragrant essential oils and volatile fatty acids.\r\n\r\nWhen boiled with dilute sulphuric acid, aloes yields paracumaric acid,\r\nfrom which by fusion with caustic potash, as also directly from aloes,\r\nHlasiwetz (1865) obtained _Para-oxybenzoic Acid_ (p. 408). Weselsky\r\n(1872-73) has shown that accompanying the last two products, there is a\r\npeculiar, crystallizable acid, C₉H₁₀O₃, which he has named _Alorcinic\r\nAcid_.\r\n\r\nBy distillation with quicklime, E. Robiquet (1846) obtained _Aloïsol_,\r\na yellowish oil, which Rembold (1866) proved to be a mixture of\r\ndimethylated phenol (_Xylenol_)\r\n\r\n         {(CH₃)₂\r\n    C₇H₃ {, with acetone and hydrocarbons.\r\n         {OH\r\n\r\nNitric acid forms with Barbadoes aloes, but still better, as Tilden\r\nhas shown, with barbaloïn, _Aloëtic Acid_, C₁₄H₄(NO₂)₄O₂, _Chrysammic\r\nAcid_, C₁₄H₄(NO₂)₄O₄, and finally _Picric Acid_, together with _Oxalic\r\nAcid_. The first two of these acids are distinguished by the splendid\r\ntints of their salts, which might be utilized in dyeing.\r\n\r\nChlorine, passed into an aqueous solution of aloes, forms a variety of\r\nsubstitution-products, and finally _Chloranil_, C₆Cl₄O₂.\r\n\r\nWhen somewhat strongly heated, aloes swells up considerably, and after\r\nignition leaves a light, slow-burning charcoal, almost free from\r\ninorganic constituents. Ordinary Cape aloes, for example, dried at 100°\r\nC., leaves only 1 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—There were imported into the United Kingdom in the year\r\n1870, 6264 cwt. of aloes. Of this quantity, South Africa shipped 4811\r\ncwt.; and Barbados 970 cwt. The remainder was probably furnished by\r\nEastern Africa.\r\n\r\nThe commercial value of the varieties of aloes is very different.\r\nIn 1874, _Barbados Aloes_ was quoted in price-currents at £3 5_s._\r\nto £9 10_s._ per cwt.; _Socotrine_ at £5 to £13; while _Cape Aloes_\r\nwas offered at £1 10_s._ to £2. In England, the first two alone\r\nare allowed for pharmaceutical preparations. Even the _Veterinary\r\nPharmacopœia_[2581] names only _Aloë Barbadensis_. Cape Aloes is\r\nesteemed on the Continent, and chiefly consumed there.\r\n\r\n=Use=—Aloes is a valuable purgative in very common use, it is generally\r\ngiven combined with other drugs.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The physical characters of aloes, such as colour of the\r\npowder, odour, consistence and freedom from obvious impurity, coupled\r\nwith its solubility in weak alcohol, usually suffice for determining\r\nits goodness.\r\n\r\n\r\nBULBUS SCILLÆ.\r\n\r\n_Radix Scillæ_; _Squill_; F. _Bulbe ou squames de Scille_, _Ognon\r\nmarin_; G. _Meerzwiebel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Urginea maritima_ Baker[2582] (_Scilla maritima_\r\nL., _Urginea Scilla_ Steinheil). It is found generally in the regions\r\nbordering the Mediterranean, as in Southern France, Italy, Dalmatia,\r\nGreece, Asia Minor, Syria, North Africa and the Mediterranean islands.\r\nIn Sicily, where it grows most abundantly, Urginea ascends to\r\nelevations of 3000 feet. It is also very common throughout the South of\r\nSpain, where it is by no means confined to the coast; it occurs also in\r\nPortugal. In the Riviera of Genoa the peasants like to see it growing\r\nunder the fig trees.\r\n\r\nTwo varieties of squill, termed respectively _white_ and _red_,\r\nare distinguished by druggists. In the first, the bulb-scales are\r\ncolourless; in the second they are of a roseate hue. No other\r\ndifference in the plants can be pointed out, nor have the two varieties\r\ndistinct areas of growth.\r\n\r\n=History=—Squill is one of the most ancient of medicines. Epimenides,\r\na Greek who lived in the 30th Olympiad, is said to have made much use\r\nof it, from which circumstance it came to be called _Epimenidea_[2583].\r\nIt is also mentioned by Theophrastus, and was probably well known\r\nto all the ancient Greek physicians. Pliny was not only acquainted\r\nwith it, but had noticed its two varieties. Dioscorides describes the\r\nmethod of making vinegar of squills; and a similar preparation, as well\r\nas compounds of squill with honey, were administered by the Arabian\r\nphysicians, and still remain in use. The medical school of Salerno\r\npreferred the red variety of the drug, which on the whole is not\r\nfrequently met with in mediæval literature.\r\n\r\n[2581] By R. V. Tuson, London, 1869.\r\n\r\n[2582] _Journ. of Linn. Soc._, Bot., xiii. (1872) 221.—The genus\r\n_Urginea_ has flat, discoid seeds, while in _Scilla_ proper they are\r\ntriquetrous. The name _Urginea_ was given in allusion to the Algerian\r\ntribe Ben _Urgin_, near Bona, where Steinheil (1834) examined this\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n[2583] Haller, _Bibliotheca botanica_, i. 12.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The bulb of squill is pear-shaped, and of the size of\r\na man’s fist or larger, often weighing more than four pounds. It\r\nhas the usual structure of a tunicated bulb; its outer scales are\r\nreddish-brown, dry, scarious, and marked with parallel veins. The inner\r\nare fleshy and juicy, colourless or of a pale rose tint, thick towards\r\nthe middle, very thin and delicate at the edges, smooth and shining on\r\nthe surface. The fresh bulb has a mucilaginous, bitter, acrid taste,\r\nbut not much odour.\r\n\r\nFor medicinal use, squill is mostly imported ready dried. The bulbs are\r\ncollected in the month of August, at which period they are leafless,\r\nfreed from their dry outer scales, cut transversely into thin slices,\r\nand dried in the sun. Thus prepared, the drug appears in the form of\r\nnarrow, flattish or four-sided curved strips, 1 to 2 inches long, and ⅜\r\nto ⅝ of an inch wide, flexible, translucent, of a pale dull yellowish\r\ncolour, or when derived from the red variety, of a decided roseate\r\nhue. When thoroughly dried, they become brittle and pulverizable, but\r\nreadily absorb water to the extent of about 11 per cent. Powdered\r\nsquill by the absorption of water from the air, readily cakes together\r\ninto a hard mass.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The officinal portion of the plant being simply\r\nmodified leaves, has the histological characters proper to many of\r\nthose organs. The tissue is made up of polyhedral cells, covered on\r\nboth sides of the scales by an epidermis provided with stomata. It\r\nis traversed by numerous vascular bundles, and also exhibits smaller\r\nbundles of laticiferous vessels. If thin slices of squill be moistened\r\nwith dilute alcohol, most of the parenchymatous cells are seen to be\r\nloaded with _mucilage_, which contracts into a jelly on the addition of\r\nalcohol. In the interior of this jelly, crystalline particles are met\r\nwith consisting of oxalate of calcium. This salt is largely deposited\r\nin cells, forming either bundles of needle-shaped crystals, or large\r\nsolitary square prisms, frequently a millimetre long. In either case\r\nthey are enveloped by the mucilaginous matter already mentioned.\r\nOxalate of calcium as occurring in other plants has been shown in many\r\ninstances to originate in the midst of mucilaginous matter. The fact is\r\nremarkably evident in _Scilla_, especially when examined in polarized\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nOn shaking thin slices of the bulb with water, the crystals are\r\ndeposited in sufficient quantity to become visible to the naked eye,\r\nthough their weight is actually very small. Direct estimation of the\r\noxalic acid (by titration with chamæleon solution) gave us only 3·07\r\nper cent. of C₂CaO₄,3H₂O from white squill dried at 100° C., which\r\nmoreover yielded only 2 to 5 per cent. of ash. It is these extremely\r\nsharp brittle crystals which occasion the itching and redness, and\r\nsometimes even vesication, which result from rubbing a slice of fresh\r\nsquill on the skin. These effects, which have long been known, were\r\nattributed to a volatile acrid principle, until their true cause was\r\nrecognized by Schroff.[2584]\r\n\r\n[2584] We have found that the slimy juice of the leaves of _Agapanthus\r\numbellatus_ Hérit., which is very rich in spicular crystals, also\r\noccasions when rubbed on the skin both itching and redness, lasting for\r\nseveral hours.\r\n\r\nThe mucilage also contains albuminous matters, hence the orange colour\r\nit assumes on addition of iodine. The vascular bundles are accompanied\r\nby some rows of longitudinally extended cells, containing a small\r\nnumber of starch granules. In the red squill the colouring matter is\r\ncontained in many of the parenchymatous cells, others being entirely\r\ndevoid of it. It turns blackish-green if a persalt of iron be added.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The most abundant among the constituents of\r\nsquill are mucilaginous and saccharine matters. Mucilage may be\r\nprecipitated by means of neutral and basic acetate of lead, yet there\r\nremains in solution another substance of the same class, called\r\n_Sinistrin_. It was discovered in 1879 by Schmiedeberg, who obtained it\r\nby mixing the powder of squill, either red or white, with a solution of\r\nbasic acetate of lead in slight excess. The gummy matters thus forming\r\ninsoluble lead compounds being removed, the liquid is deprived of the\r\nlead and mixed with slaked lime. An insoluble compound of sinistrin\r\nand calcium separates and yields the former on decomposing the well\r\nwashed precipitate with carbonic acid. The small amount of calcium\r\nremaining in the filtrate is to be removed by adding cautiously to the\r\nwarm solution the small quantity just required of oxalic acid. Lastly,\r\nsinistrin is thrown down by alcohol. It is a white amorphous powder, on\r\nexposure to air soon forming transparent brittle lumps. The composition\r\nof sinistrin is that of dextrin = C₆H₁₀O₅, both these substances being\r\nvery closely allied, yet the aqueous solution of sinistrin deviates the\r\nplane of polarization to the left. The rotatory power appears not to be\r\nmuch influenced by the concentration or the temperature of the solution\r\nof sinistrin.\r\n\r\nAn alkaline solution of tartrate of copper is not acted upon by\r\nsinistrin. It is transformed into sugar by boiling it for half an hour\r\nwith water containing 1 per cent. of sulphuric acid. The sugar thus\r\nproduced is stated by Schmiedeberg to consist of lævulose[2585] and\r\nanother sugar, which in all probability, when perfectly pure, must\r\nprove devoid of rotatory power.\r\n\r\nThe name sinistrin[2586] has also been applied to a mucilaginous matter\r\nextracted from barley (see Hordeum decorticatum); it remains to be\r\nproved that the latter is identical with the sinistrin of squill.\r\n\r\nWe have obtained a considerable amount of an uncrystallizable levogyre\r\nsugar by exhausting squill with dilute alcohol.[2587] Alcohol added to\r\nan aqueous infusion of squill causes the separation of the mucilage,\r\ntogether with albuminoid matter. If the alcohol is evaporated and\r\na solution of tannic acid is added, the latter will combine with\r\nthe _bitter principle_ of squill, which has not yet been isolated,\r\nalthough several chemists have devoted to it their investigations,\r\nand applied to it the names of _Scillitin_ or _Skuleïn_. Schroff, to\r\nwhom we are indebted for a valuable monograph on Squill,[2588] infers\r\nfrom his physiological experiments the presence of a non-volatile\r\nacrid principle (_Skulein?_), together with scillitin, which latter he\r\nsupposes to be a glucoside.\r\n\r\nMerck of Darmstadt has isolated _Scillipicrin_, soluble in water;\r\n_Scillitoxin_, likewise a bitter principle, insoluble in water, but\r\nreadily dissolving in alcohol; and _Scillin_, a crystalline substance,\r\nabundantly soluble in boiling ether. The physiological action of these\r\nsubstances and of _Scillaïn_ has been examined (1878) by Moeller, and\r\nby Jarmersted (1879); that of scillitoxin and scillaïn was found to be\r\nanalogous to that of Digitalis.\r\n\r\n[2585] This is the name applied to the lævogyrate uncrystallizable\r\nglucose produced, together with crystallizable dextro-glucose, by\r\ndecomposing cane-sugar by means of dilute acids.\r\n\r\n[2586] In 1834 first proposed, by Marquart, for inulin.\r\n\r\n[2587] In Greece they have even attempted to manufacture alcohol by\r\nfermenting and distilling squill bulbs.—Heldreich, _Nutzpflanzen\r\nGriechenlands_, 1862. 7.\r\n\r\n[2588] Reprinted from the _Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft der Aerzte zu\r\nWien_, No. 42 (1864). Abstracted also in Canstatt’s _Jahresbericht_\r\n1864. 19, and 1865. 238.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—Dried squill, usually packed in casks, is imported into\r\nEngland from Malta.\r\n\r\n=Use=—Commonly employed as a diuretic and expectorant.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—There are several plants of which the bulbs are used in\r\nthe place of the officinal squill, but which, owing to the abundance\r\nand low price of the latter, never appear in the European market.\r\n\r\n1. _Urginea altissima_ Baker (_Ornithogalum altissimum_ L.), a South\r\nAfrican species, very closely related to the common squill, and having,\r\nas it would appear, exactly the same properties.[2589]\r\n\r\n2. _U. indica_ Kth. (_Scilla indica_ Roxb.), a widely diffused plant,\r\noccurring in Northern India, the Coromandel Coast, Abyssinia, Nubia,\r\nand Senegambia. It is known by the same Arabic and Persian names as _U.\r\nmaritima_, and its bulb is used for similar purposes. But according to\r\nMoodeen Sheriff[2590] it is a poor substitute for the latter, having\r\nlittle or no action when it is old and large.\r\n\r\n3. _Scilla indica_ Baker[2591] (non Roxb.), (_Ledebouria hyacinthina_\r\nRoth), native of India and Abyssinia, has a bulb which is often\r\nconfused in the Indian bazaars with the preceding, but is easily\r\ndistinguishable when entire by being _scaly_ (not tunicated); it is\r\nsaid to be a better representative of the European squill.[2592]\r\n\r\n4. _Drimia ciliaris_ Jacq., a plant of the Cape of Good Hope, of the\r\norder _Liliaceæ_. Its bulb much resembles the officinal squill, but has\r\na juice so irritating if it comes in contact with the skin, that the\r\nplant is called by the colonists _Jeukbol_, i.e. _Itch-bulb_. It is\r\nused medicinally as an emetic, expectorant, and diuretic.[2593]\r\n\r\n5. _Crinum asiaticum_ var. _toxicarium_ Herbert (_C. toxicarium_\r\nRoxb.), a large plant, with handsome white flowers and noble foliage,\r\ncultivated in Indian gardens, and also found wild in low humid spots\r\nin various parts of India and the Moluccas, and on the sea-coast of\r\nCeylon. The bulb has been admitted to the _Pharmacopœia of India_\r\n(1868), chiefly on the recommendation of O’Shaughnessy, who considers\r\nit a valuable emetic. We have not been able to examine a specimen,\r\nand cannot learn that the drug has been the subject of any chemical\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n[2589] Pappe, _Floræ Medicæ Capensis Prodromus_, ed. 2, 1857. 41.\r\n\r\n[2590] _Supplement to the Pharmacopœia of India_, Madras, 1869. 250.\r\n\r\n[2591] Saunders, _Refugium Botanicum_, iii.

In Norway\r\nit reaches, according to Schübeler (_l. c._ p. 556), the latitude of\r\n71°. It also grows throughout European and Asiatic Russia as far as 61°\r\nN. lat., in Amurland, the island of Saghalin, Northern China, and Japan.\r\n\r\n=History=—The confusion that existed among the ancients between\r\n_Melampodium_, _Helleborus_, and _Veratrum_, makes the identification\r\nof the plant under notice extremely unsatisfactory.[2594] It was\r\nperfectly described or figured by Brunfels, Tragus, and other botanists\r\nof the 16th century, and likewise well known to Gerarde (_circa_ A.D.\r\n1600). Under the names of _Elleborus_ (or _Helleborus albus_) and\r\n_Veratrum_, it has had a place in all the London Pharmacopœias. In the\r\nBritish Pharmacopœia (1867) it has been replaced by the nearly allied\r\nAmerican species, _Veratrum viride_ Aiton.\r\n\r\n=Description=—White Hellebore has a cylindrical, fleshy, perennial\r\nrootstock, 2 to 3 inches in length, and ¾ to 1 inch in diameter, beset\r\nwith long stout roots. When fresh it has an alliaceous smell. In the\r\ndried state, as it occurs in commerce, it is cylindrical or subconical,\r\nof a dull earthy black, very rough in its lower half with the pits and\r\nscars of old roots; more or less beset above with the remains of recent\r\nroots. The top is crowned with the bases of the leaves, the outer of\r\nwhich are coarsely fibrous. The plant has generally been cut off close\r\nto the summit of the rhizome, which latter is seldom quite entire,\r\nbeing often broken at its lower end, or cut transversely to facilitate\r\ndrying. Internally it is nearly colourless; a transverse section shows\r\na broad white ring surrounding a spongy pale buff central portion.\r\n\r\nThe drug has a sweetish, bitterish acrid taste, leaving on the tongue\r\na sensation of numbness and tingling. In the state of powder, it\r\noccasions violent sneezing.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—When cut transversely, the rhizome shows at\r\na distance of 2-4 mm. from the thin dark outer bark, a fine brown\r\nzigzag line (medullary sheath) surrounding the central part, which\r\nexhibits a pith not well defined. The zone between the outer bark\r\nand the medullary sheath is pure white, with the exception of some\r\nisolated cells containing resin or colouring matter, and those places\r\nwhere the rootlets pass from the interior. The latter is sprinkled as\r\nit were, with short, thin somewhat lighter bundles of vessels which\r\nrun irregularly out in all directions. The parenchyme of the centre\r\nrhizome is filled with starch, and contains numerous needles of calcium\r\noxalate. The rootlets, which the collectors usually remove, are living\r\nand juicy only in the upper half of the rhizome, the lower part of\r\nwhich is rather woody and porous.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—In 1819 Pelletier and Caventou detected in the\r\nrhizome of _Veratrum_ a substance which they regarded as identical with\r\nveratrine, the existence of which had just been discovered by Meissner\r\nin cebadilla seeds. But according to the observations of Maisch (1870)\r\nand Dragendorff,[2595] the veratrine of cebadilla cannot be found\r\neither in _Veratrum album_ or _V. viride_.\r\n\r\n[2594] Those who wish to study the question, can consult Murray’s\r\n_Apparatus Medicaminum_. vol. v. (1790) 142-146.\r\n\r\n[2595] _Beitr. zur gerichtl. Chemie_, St Petersb., 1872. 95.\r\n\r\nSimon (1837) found in the root the alkaloid _Jervine_, Tobien (1877)\r\nthe _Veratroïdine_, discovered by Bullock (1876) in _Veratrum viride_.\r\nTobien assigns to jervine the formula C₂₇H₄₇N₂O₈; that of veratroïdine\r\nis not yet settled. The latter is to some extent soluble in water.\r\n\r\nWeppen (1872) has isolated from this drug _Veratramarin_, an amorphous,\r\ndeliquescent, bitter principle. It occurs in minute quantity only, and\r\nis resolvable into sugar and other products. Veratramarin dissolves\r\nin water or spirit of wine, not in ether or in chloroform. The same\r\nobserver has also isolated, to the extent of ½ per mille, _Jervic\r\nAcid_ in hard crystals of considerable size,[2596] of the composition\r\nC₁₄H₁₀O₁₂ + 2 H₂O. The acid requires 100 parts of water for solution at\r\nthe ordinary temperature, and a little less of boiling alcohol. It is\r\ndecidedly acid, and forms well-defined crystallizable salts, containing\r\n4 atoms of the monovalent metals.\r\n\r\nBy exhausting the entire rhizome (roots included) with ether and\r\nanhydrous alcohol, we obtained 25·8 per cent. of soft resin, which\r\ndeserves further examination. Pectic matter to the amount of 10 per\r\ncent. was pointed out by Wiegand in 1841.\r\n\r\nAccording to Schroff (1860), in the rootlets the active principle\r\nresides in the cortical part, the woody central portion being inert. He\r\nalso asserts that the rhizome acts less strongly than the rootlets, and\r\nin a somewhat different manner.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The drug is imported from Germany in bales. The\r\nprice-currents distinguish _Swiss_ and _Austrian_, and generally name\r\nthe drug as “_without fibre_.”\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Veratrum is an emetic and drastic purgative, rarely used\r\ninternally. It is occasionally employed in the form of ointment in\r\nscabies. Its principal consumption is in veterinary medicine.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—The rhizome of the Austrian _Veratrum nigrum_ L. is said\r\nto be sometimes collected instead of White Hellebore; it is of much\r\nsmaller size, and, according to Schroff, less potent. That of the\r\nMexican _Helonias frigida_ Lindley (_Veratrum frigidum_ Schl.) appears\r\nto exactly resemble that of _Veratrum album_.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHIZOMA VERATRI VIRIDIS.\r\n\r\n_American White Hellebore_,[2597] _Indian Poke_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Veratrum viride_ Aiton, a plant in every respect\r\nclosely resembling _V. album_, of which it is one of the numerous\r\nforms. In fact, the green-coloured variety of the latter (_V.\r\nLobelianum_ Bernh.), a plant not uncommon in the mountain meadows\r\nof the Alps, comes so near to the American _V. viride_ that we are\r\nunable to point out any important character by which the two can be\r\nseparated.[2598] The American _Veratrum_ is common in swamps and low\r\ngrounds from Canada to Georgia.\r\n\r\n[2596] For good specimens of which I am indebted to Dr. Weppen.—F. A. F.\r\n\r\n[2597] The name _Green Hellebore_ is sometimes applied to this drug,\r\nbut it properly belongs to _Helleborus viridis_ L., which is medicinal\r\nin some parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n[2598] Sims in contrasting _Veratrum viride_ with _V. album_ observes\r\nthat the flowers of the former are “more inclined to a yellow green,”\r\nthe petals broader and more erect, with the margins, especially\r\nabout the claw, thickened and covered with a white mealiness. _Bot.\r\nMag._ xxvii. (1808) tab. 1096.—Regel has described four varieties of\r\n_Veratrum album_ L., as occurring in the region of the Lower Ussuri and\r\nAmurland, one of which, var. γ., he has identified with the American\r\n_V. viride_.—_Tentamen Floræ Ussuriensis_, St. Petersb. 1761. 153.\r\n\r\n=History=—The aborigines of North America were acquainted with\r\nthe active properties of this plant before their intercourse with\r\nEuropeans, using it according to Josselyn,[2599] who visited the\r\ncountry in 1638-1671, as a vomit in a sort of ordeal. He calls it\r\n_White Hellebore_, and states that it is employed by the colonists as a\r\npurgative, antiscorbutic and insecticide.\r\n\r\nKalm (1749) states[2600] that the early settlers used a decoction of\r\nthe roots to render their seed-maize poisonous to birds, which were\r\nmade “delirious” by eating the grain, but not killed; and this custom\r\nwas still practised in New England in 1835 (Osgood).\r\n\r\nThe effects of the drug have been repeatedly tried in the United States\r\nduring the present century; and about 1862, in consequence of the\r\nstrong recommendations of Drs. Osgood, Norwood, Cutter, and others, it\r\nbegan to be prescribed in this country.\r\n\r\n=Description=—In form, internal structure, odour and taste, the rhizome\r\nand roots accord with those of _Veratrum album_; yet owing to the\r\nmethod of drying and preparing for the market, the American veratrum\r\nis immediately distinguishable from the White Hellebore of European\r\ncommerce. We have met with it in three forms:—\r\n\r\n1. The rhizome with roots attached, usually cut lengthwise into\r\nquarters, sometimes transversely also, densely beset with the pale\r\nbrown roots, which towards their extremities are clothed with slender\r\nfibrous rootlets.\r\n\r\n2. Rhizome and roots compressed into solid rectangular cakes, an inch\r\nin thickness.\r\n\r\n3. The rhizome _per se_, sliced transversely and dried. It forms\r\nwhitish, buff, or brownish discs, ½ to 1 inch or more in diameter, much\r\nshrunken and curled by drying. This is the form in which the drug is\r\nrequired by the United States Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—No chemical difference between _Veratrum viride_\r\nand _V. album_ has yet been ascertained. The presence of veratrine,\r\nsuspected by previous chemists, was asserted by Worthington[2601] in\r\n1839, J. G. Richardson of Philadelphia in 1857, and S. R. Percy in\r\n1864. Scattergood[2602] obtained from the American drug 0·4 per cent.\r\nof this alkaloid, which however, in consequence of some observations\r\nof Dragendorff (p. 694), we must hold to be not identical with that\r\nof cebadilla. As stated in a previous page jervine and veratroïdine\r\nare present as in the White Hellebore of Europe. Robbins[2603] further\r\nisolated _Veratridine_, a crystallized alkaloid possessed of a similar\r\nphysiological action to that of veratrine, though in a less degree.\r\nVeratridine is readily soluble in ether; its solution in concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid is at first yellow, changing quickly to a pink-red, and,\r\nafter several hours’ standing, assumes a clear indigo-blue colour, much\r\nthe same as that displayed by veratrine _if mixed with sugar_ (Weppen’s\r\ntest, 1874). The resin of the drug may be prepared by exhausting\r\nit with alcohol and precipitating with boiling acidulated water,\r\nrepeating the process in order to entirely eliminate the alkaloids. It\r\nis a dark brown mass, yielding about a fourth of its weight to ether.\r\nScattergood obtained it to the extent of 4½ per cent. By exhausting the\r\ndrug successively with ether, absolute alcohol and spirit of wine, we\r\nextracted from it not less than 31 per cent. of a soft resinoid mass.\r\nWorthington pointed out the presence of gallic acid and of sugar.\r\n\r\n[2599] _New England’s Rarities discovered_, Lond. 1672. 43; also\r\n_Account of two Voyages to New England_, Lond., 1674, 60. 76.\r\n\r\n[2600] _Travels in North America_, vol. ii.

It is stated to lower the pulse,\r\nthe respiration and beat of the body, not to be narcotic, and rarely\r\nto occasion purging;[2604] but to what principle these effects are due\r\nhas not yet been ascertained. By some observers, as Bigelow,[2605]\r\nFée,[2606] Schroff,[2607] and Oulmont,[2608] it is alleged to have the\r\nsame medicinal powers as the European _Veratrum album_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEN SABADILLÆ.\r\n\r\n_Fructus Sabadillæ_; _Cebadilla_, _Cevadilla_; F. _Cévadille_; G.\r\n_Sabadillsamen_, _Läusesamen_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Asagræa officinalis_ Lindley (_Veratrum officinale_\r\nSchlecht, _Sabadilla officinarum_ Brandt, _Schœnocaulon officinale_\r\nA.

It is not mentioned as West\r\nIndian by Grisebach (_Flor. of Brit. W. I. Islands_, 1864; _Cat.\r\nPlant. Cubensium_, 1866). The figure by Descourtilz (_Flor. méd.\r\ndes Antilles_, iii. 1827. t. 1859) who had the plant growing at St.\r\nDomingo, shows it to resemble _Veratrum album_ L., and therefore to be\r\nvery different from _Asagræa_.\r\n\r\n=History=—Cebadilla was first described in 1517 by Monardes, who states\r\nthat it is used by the Indians of New Spain as a caustic and corrosive\r\napplication to wounds; but it does not seem to have been brought into\r\nEuropean commerce, for neither Parkinson who described it in 1640\r\nas the _Indian Causticke Barley_, nor Ray (1693) did more than copy\r\nfrom Monardes. It was regarded in Germany a rare drug even in 1726,\r\nbut in the latter half of the last century it began to be recommended\r\nin France and Germany for the destruction of pediculi. A famous\r\ncomposition for this purpose was the _Poudre des Capucins_, consisting\r\nof a mixture of stavesacre, tobacco, and cebadilla, which was applied\r\neither dry or made into an ointment with lard.[2612] Cebadilla was also\r\nadministered combined into a pill with gamboge and valerian,[2613] for\r\nthe destruction of intestinal worms, but its virulent action made it\r\nhazardous.\r\n\r\nUpon the introduction of veratrine into medicine about 1824 cebadilla\r\nattracted some notice, and was occasionally prescribed in the form of\r\ntincture and extract; but it subsequently fell into disuse, and is now\r\nonly employed for the manufacture of veratrine.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Each fruit consists of three oblong pointed follicles,\r\nabout ½ an inch in length, surrounded below by the remains of the\r\n6-partite calyx, and attached to a short pedicel. The follicles are\r\nunited at the base, spread somewhat towards the apex, and open by their\r\nventral suture. They are of a light brown colour and papery substance.\r\nEach usually contains two-pointed narrow black seeds, ³/₁₀ of an inch\r\nin length, which are shining, rugose, and angular or concave by mutual\r\npressure. The compact testa encloses an oily albumen, at the base of\r\nwhich, opposite to the beaked apex, lies the small embryo. The seed\r\nis inodorous and has a bitter acrid taste; when powdered, it produces\r\nviolent sneezing.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—A transverse section shows the horny\r\nconcentrically radiated albumen, closely attached to the testa. The\r\nlatter consists of an outer layer of cuboid cells, and three rows of\r\nsmaller, thin-walled, tangentially-extended cells, all of which have\r\nbrown walls. The tissue of the albumen is made up of large porous\r\ncells, containing drops of oil, granules of albuminoid matter, and\r\nmucilage. Traces of tannic acid occur only in the outer layers of the\r\nseed.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Meissner, an apothecary of Halle, Prussia,\r\nin 1819 discovered in cebadilla a basic substance, which he termed\r\n_Sabadilline_; in publishing, in 1821, the description of it the\r\nword “_alkaloid_” was introduced by Meissner at that occasion. The\r\nname _Veratrine_[2614] was applied likewise in 1819 by Pelletier and\r\nCaventou to a similar preparation. For many years this substance\r\nwas known only as an amorphous powder, in which state it frequently\r\ncontained a considerable proportion of resin; but in 1855 it was\r\nobtained by G. Merck in large rhombic prisms. Cebadilla yields only\r\nabout 3 per mille of veratrine. The alkaloid is easily soluble in\r\nspirit of wine, ether or chloroform; these solutions, as well as the\r\nwatery solutions of its salts, are devoid of rotatory power. Veratrine,\r\nlike the drug from which it is derived, occasions, if inhaled,\r\nprolonged sternutation.\r\n\r\n[2612] Murray, _Apparatus Medicaminum_, v. (1790) 171; Mérat and De\r\nLens, _Dict. Mat. Méd._ vi. (1834) 862.\r\n\r\n[2613] Peyrilhe, _Cours. d’Hist. Nat. Méd._ ii. (1804) 490.\r\n\r\n[2614] So called from Schlechtendal’s name for the plant, _Veratrum\r\nofficinale_.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1834, Conerbe described an alkaloid from cebadilla under the\r\nname of _Sabadilline_, and _Weigelin_ (1871) another called _Sabatrine_.\r\n\r\nFrom the investigations of Wright and Luff (1878) it appears that the\r\nabove-mentioned statements must be resumed thus:—There are in cebadilla\r\nthree alkaloids, namely _Veratrine_, C₃₇H₅₃NO₁₁, _Cevadine_, C₃₂H₄₉NO₉,\r\nand _Cevadilline_, C₃₄H₅₃NO₈, the second only being crystallizable.\r\n\r\nVeratrin may be decomposed by means of caustic lye into a new alkaloid,\r\nverine, and dimethyl-protocatechuic acid,\r\n\r\n         {(OCH₃)₂\r\n    C₆H₃ {\r\n         {COOH\r\n\r\nBy the same treatment, cevadine yields an acid which appears to be\r\nidentical with tiglinic acid (page 566), and an alkaloid called cevine.\r\n\r\nCebadilla yielded to Pelletier and Caventou a volatile fatty acid,\r\n_Sabadillic_ or _Cevadic Acid_, the needle-shaped crystals of which\r\nfuse at 20° C. Lastly, E. Merck (1839) found a second peculiar acid\r\ntermed _Veratric Acid_, affording quadrangular prisms, which can be\r\nsublimed without decomposition. It is yielded by cebadilla to the\r\nextent of but ⅙ per mille. It has been shown in 1876 by Körner to be\r\nidentical with dimethyl-protocatechuic acid just mentioned (see also\r\nour article _Tubera Aconiti_, p. 9).\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The quantity of cebadilla (_seeds_ only) shipped in 1876\r\nfrom La Guaira, the port of Caracas, was 35,033 kilos., of which 25,966\r\nwent to Germany. No other sort is now imported.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Cebadilla is at present, we believe, only used as the source\r\nof veratrine. In Mexico, the bulb of the plant is employed as an\r\nanthelminthic, under the name of _Cebolleja_, but it is said to be very\r\ndangerous in its action.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORMUS COLCHICI.\r\n\r\n_Tuber vel Bulbus vel Radix Colchici_; _Meadow Saffron Root_; F. _Bulbe\r\nde Colchique_; G. _Zeitlosenknollen_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Colchicum autumnale_ L.—This plant grows in meadows\r\nand pastures over the greater part of Northern Africa, Middle and\r\nSouthern Europe, and is plentiful in many localities in England and\r\nIreland. In the Swiss Alps, it ascends to an elevation of 5500 feet\r\nabove the sea-level.\r\n\r\n=History=—Dioscorides drew attention to the poisonous properties\r\nof Κολχικὸν, which he stated to be a plant growing in Messenia and\r\nColchis.[2615]\r\n\r\n[2615] His description is exact, except that he declares the corm to\r\nhave a _sweet_ taste, which seems not true for _Colchicum autumnale_,\r\nbut may be so for some other species.\r\n\r\nThis character for deleterious qualities seems to have prevented\r\nthe use of colchicum both in classical and mediæval times. Thus\r\nTragus (1552) warns his readers against its use in gout, for which\r\nit is recommended in the writings of the Arabians. Jacques Grévin,\r\na physician of Paris, author of _Deux Livres des Venins_, dedicated\r\nto Queen Elizabeth of England, and printed at Antwerp in 1568,\r\nobserves—“ce poison est ennemy de la nature de l’homme en tout et\r\npar tout.” Dodoens calls it _perniciosum Colchicum_; and Lyte in his\r\ntranslation of this author (1578) says—“Medow or Wilde Saffron is\r\ncorrupt and venomous, therefore not used in medicine.” Gerarde declares\r\nthe roots of “_Mede Saffron_” to be “very hurtfull to the stomacke.”\r\n\r\nWedel published in 1718, at Jena, an essay _De Colchico veneno et\r\nalexipharmaco_, in which, to show the great disfavour in which this\r\nplant had been held, he remarks,—“hactenus ... velut infame habitum\r\net damnatum fuit colchicum, indignum habitum inter herbas medicas vel\r\nofficinales....” He further states that, in the 17th century, the corms\r\nwere worn by the peasants in some parts of Germany as a charm against\r\nthe plague.\r\n\r\nIn the face of these severe denunciations, it is strange to find that\r\nin the London Pharmacopœia of 1618 (the second edition), “_Radix\r\nColchici_,” as well as _Hermodactylus_, is enumerated among the simple\r\ndrugs; and again in the editions of 1627, 1632 and 1639. It is omitted\r\nin that of 1650, and does not reappear in subsequent editions until\r\n1788, when owing to the investigations of Störck (1763), Kratochwill\r\n(1764), De Berge (1765), Ehrmann (1772), and others, the possibility of\r\nemploying it usefully in medicine had been made evident.\r\n\r\n=Development of the Corm=[2616]—At the period of flowering, the corm\r\nis surrounded with a brown, closed double membrane or tunic, which\r\nis prolonged upwards into a sheath around the flowering stem; at the\r\nbase of the corm is a tuft of simple roots. On removing the membranes,\r\nwe find a large, ovoid, fleshy body (Corm No. 1), marked at its apex\r\nby a depressed scar, the point of attachment of the flower-stem of\r\nthe previous year; it is on one side flattened, and traversed by a\r\nshallow longitudinal furrow, from the upper part of which arises a much\r\nsmaller and rudimentary corm (No. 2), bearing a flower-stem. After the\r\nproduction of the flower in the autumn, Corm No. 2 increases in size,\r\nthrowing up as spring advances its fruit-stem and leaves, and acquires,\r\nafter these latter have come to maturity, its full development. Corm\r\nNo. 1 on the other hand, having performed its functions, shrivels and\r\ndiminishes in size, in proportion as No. 2 advances to maturity, and\r\nultimately decays, leaving a rounded cicatrix, showing its point of\r\nattachment to its successor.\r\n\r\n=Collection=—In England the corms are usually dug up and brought to\r\nmarket in July, at the period between the decay of the foliage and the\r\nproduction of the flower, or even after the latter has appeared. For\r\nsome preparations, they are used in the fresh state. If to be dried, it\r\nis customary to slice them across thinly and evenly with a knife, and\r\nto dry the slices quickly in a stove with a gentle heat; the membranes\r\nare afterwards removed by sifting or winnowing.\r\n\r\nSchroff has stated, as the result of his experiments,[2617] that the\r\ncorms possess the greatest medicinal activity when collected in the\r\nautumn during or after inflorescence; that they ought to be dried\r\nentire, by exposure to the sun and air; and that if thus preserved,\r\nthey lose none of their strength, even if kept for several years.\r\n\r\n[2616] The term _corm_ is applied by English writers to the short,\r\nfleshy, bulb-shaped base of an annual stem, either lateral as in\r\n_Colchicum_, or terminal as in _Crocus_. By many continental botanists,\r\nthe corm of _Colchicum_ is regarded either as a form of tuber, or of\r\nbulb.\r\n\r\n[2617] _Oesterreichische Zeitschrift für praktische Heilkunde_, 1856,\r\nNos. 22-24; also Wiggers, _Jahresbericht der Pharm._ 1856. 15.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fresh corm is conical or inversely pear-shaped, about\r\n2 inches long by an inch or more wide, rounded on one side, flattish\r\non the other, covered by a bright brown, membranous skin, within\r\nwhich is a second of paler colour. When cut transversely, it appears\r\nwhite, firm, fleshy and homogeneous, abounding in a bitter, starchy\r\njuice, of disagreeable odour. The dried slices are inodorous, and have\r\na bitterish taste. They should be of a good white, clean, crisp and\r\nbrittle,—not mouldy or stained.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The outer membrane is formed of\r\ntangentially-extended cells, with thick brownish walls; the main body\r\nof the corm, of large thin-walled, more or less regularly globular\r\ncells, loaded with starch, and interrupted by vascular bundles\r\ncontaining spiral vessels. The original form of the starch granules is\r\nglobular or egg-shaped, but from mutual pressure and agglutination,\r\nmany are angular or truncated. A large proportion are more or less\r\ncompound, consisting of several granules united into one. In all, the\r\nhilum is very distinct, appearing in some as a mere point, but in most\r\nas a line or star.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The corms contain _Colchicin_ (see next\r\narticle), starch, sugar, gum, resin, tannin, and fat. When sliced\r\nand dried, they lose about 70 per cent. of water.[2618] By drying,\r\nthe (probably) volatile body upon which the odour of the fresh corm\r\ndepends, is lost.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Colchicum is much prescribed in cases of gout, rheumatism,\r\ndropsy, and cutaneous maladies.\r\n\r\nOther medicinal species of Colchicum.\r\n\r\nUnder the name _Hermodactylus_,[2619] the corms of other species of\r\n_Colchicum_ of Eastern origin anciently enjoyed great reputation in\r\nmedicine. These corms are in structure precisely like those of ordinary\r\ncolchicum; they are entire, but deprived of membranous envelopes, of a\r\nflattened, heart-shaped form, not wrinkled on the surface, and often\r\nvery small in size. The starch grains they contain are similar to those\r\nof _C. autumnale_, but in some specimens twice as large.\r\n\r\nThere is a great uncertainty as to the species of _Colchicum_ which\r\nfurnish hermodactyls. Prof. J. E. Planchon, who has written an\r\nelaborate article on the subject,[2620] is in favour of _C. variegatum_\r\nL., a native of the Levant. But one can hardly suppose this plant to\r\nbe the source of the hermodactyls (_Sūrinjān_) of the Indian bazaars,\r\nwhich are stated to be brought from Kashmir.\r\n\r\n[2618] This is the average obtained during ten years in drying 16 cwt.,\r\nin the laboratory of Messrs. Allen and Hanburys, London.\r\n\r\n[2619] The _Bitter Hermodactyl_ of Royle is not in our opinion the\r\nproduce of a _Colchicum_ at all; see also Cooke in _Pharm. Journ._\r\nApril 1, 1871.\r\n\r\n[2620] _Ann. des Sciences Nat._, Bot., iv. (1855) 132; abstract in\r\n_Pharm. Journ._ xv.

The inflated\r\ncapsule, which grows up in the spring after the disappearance of the\r\nflower in the autumn, is three-celled, dehiscent towards the apex by\r\nits ventral sutures, and contains, attached to the inner angle of the\r\ncarpels, numerous globular seeds, which arrive at maturity in the\r\nlatter part of the summer.\r\n\r\n=History=—Colchicum seeds were introduced into medical practice by Dr.\r\nW. H. Williams, of Ipswich, about 1820, on the ground of their being\r\nmore certain in action than the corm.[2621] They were admitted to the\r\nLondon Pharmacopœia in 1824.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The seeds are of globose form, about ⅒ of an inch in\r\ndiameter, somewhat pointed by a strophiole, which when dry is not\r\nvery evident. They are rather rough and dull; when recent of a pale\r\nbrown, but become darker by drying, and at the same time exude a sort\r\nof saccharine matter. They are inodorous even when fresh, but have a\r\nbitter acrid taste; they are very hard and difficult to powder.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The reticulated, brown coat of the seed\r\nconsists of a few rows of large, thin-walled tangentially-extended\r\ncells, considerably smaller towards the interior, the outermost\r\ncontaining starch grains in small number. The thin testa is closely\r\nadherent to the horny greyish albumen. The cells of the latter are\r\nremarkable for their thick walls, showing wide pores; they contain\r\ngranular plasma and oil-drops. The very small leafless embryo may be\r\nobserved on transverse section close beneath the testa on the side\r\nopposite the strophiole.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The active principle of colchicum seed is\r\ntermed _Colchicin_, but the chemists who have made it the subject\r\nof investigation are not agreed as to its properties. Thus Oberlin\r\n(1856) showed it to contain nitrogen, but without possessing basic\r\nproperties. By treatment with acids, the amorphous colchicin yields a\r\ncrystallizable body, _Colchiceïn_. Hübler (1864) prepared colchicin\r\nin the same way by which the so-called “bitter principles,” like\r\ndulcamarin (p. 451) are obtainable. He assigned to colchiceïn acid\r\nqualities and, strangely enough, the same formula he gave for colchicin\r\nitself, namely C₁₇H₁₉NO₅. Maisch[2622] as well as Diehl[2623] again\r\nobtained discrepant results. _Colchicin_ of definite composition has\r\nnot yet been isolated.\r\n\r\n[2621] _London Medical Repository_, Aug. 1, 1820.\r\n\r\n[2622] _Pharm.

Assoc._ 1867. 363.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that in an aqueous or alcoholic extract of the seed\r\nan extremely small amount of an alkaloid is present, but that a basic\r\nsubstance is immediately formed on addition of mineral acids, or\r\nalso oxalic acid. This suggestion is to some extent supported by the\r\nfollowing facts:—\r\n\r\nBy adding the usual test solution for alkaloids, _i.e._ iodohydrogyrate\r\nof potassium (50 grammes of iodide of potassium, 13·5 of perchloride of\r\nmercury in one litre), to an aqueous solution of an alcoholic extract\r\nof the seeds, a very slight turbidity, or an insignificant precipitate\r\nis observed. Yet on addition of sulphuric, or nitric, or hydrochloric\r\nacid, an abundant precipitate of a beautiful yellow is at once\r\nproduced. This experiment succeeds with a few seeds, either entire or\r\npowdered; it may be conveniently applied for the detection of colchicum\r\nin any preparation. We have ascertained that the yellow precipitate\r\ncan be obtained also with the other parts of the plant. If the yellow\r\ncompound is decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen, the filtrate, after\r\ndue concentration, now precipitates immediately on addition of the\r\niodohydrogyrate, yet still more abundantly in presence of a mineral\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nThe seeds contain traces of gallic acid, much sugar and fatty oil. Of\r\nthe last we obtained 6·6 per cent. by exhausting the dried seed with\r\nether. The oil concreted at -8° C. Rosenwasser (1877) obtained 8·4 per\r\ncent. of the oil.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The same as those of the corm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSMILACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIX SARSAPARILLÆ.\r\n\r\n_Radix Sarzæ vel Sarsæ_; _Sarsaparilla_; F. _Racine de Salsepareille_;\r\nG. _Sarsaparillwurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—Sarsaparilla is afforded by several plants of the\r\ngenus _Smilax_, indigenous to the northern half of South America,\r\nand the whole of Central America as far as the southern and western\r\ncoast-lands of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThese plants are woody climbers, often ascending lofty trees by the\r\nstrong tendrils which spring from the petiole of the leaf. Their stems\r\nare usually angular, armed with stout prickles, and thrown up from a\r\nlarge woody rhizome. The medicinal species inhabit swampy tropical\r\nforests, which are extremely deleterious to the health of Europeans,\r\nand can only be explored amid great difficulties. This circumstance\r\ntaken in connexion with the facts that the plants are diœcious, that\r\ntheir scandent habit often renders their flowers and fruits (produced\r\nat different seasons) inaccessible, and that their leaves vary\r\nexceedingly in form,[2624] explains why we are but very imperfectly\r\nacquainted with the botanical sources of sarsaparilla.\r\n\r\n[2624] The common _Smilax aspera_ L., of Southern Europe, is a plant\r\nwhich presents such diversity of foliage, that if like its congeners of\r\nTropical America, it were known only by a few leafy scraps preserved in\r\nherbaria, it would assuredly have been referred to several species.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to assert that the sarsaparilla plant of no district\r\nin Tropical America is scientifically well known. The species moreover,\r\nto which the drug is assigned, have for the most part been founded upon\r\ncharacters that are totally insufficient, so that after an attentive\r\nstudy of herbarium specimens, we are obliged to regard as still\r\ndoubtful several of the plants that have been named by previous writers.\r\n\r\nHaving made these preliminary remarks, we will enumerate the plants to\r\nwhich the sarsaparilla of commerce has been ascribed.\r\n\r\n1. _Smilax officinalis_ H.B.K.—This plant was obtained in the year\r\n1805, by Humboldt, at Bajorque, a village since swept away by the\r\nstream, about in 7° N. lat., on the Magdalena in New Granada. The\r\nspecimens, comprising only a few imperfect leaves, which we have\r\nexamined in the National Herbarium of Paris, are the materials upon\r\nwhich Kunth founded the species. Humboldt[2625] states, that quantities\r\nof the root are shipped by way of Mompox and Cartagena to Jamaica and\r\nCadiz.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 this plant was again gathered at Bajorque by the late De\r\nWarszewicz, who sent to one of us (H.) leaves and stems, accompanied\r\nby the root, which latter agrees with the _Jamaica Sarsaparilla_\r\nof commerce. But at Bajorque the root is no longer collected for\r\nexportation.\r\n\r\nThe same botanical collector, at the request of one of us, obtained in\r\nthe year 1851, on the volcano and Cordillera of Chiriqui in Costa Rica,\r\nfruits, leaves, stems, and roots, of the plant there collected by the\r\nIndians as _Sarsa peluda_ or _Sarson_. These specimens agree, so far\r\nas comparison is possible, with those of the Bajorque plant, while the\r\nroot is undistinguishable from the Jamaica sarsaparilla of the shops.\r\nOther specimens of the same plant, gathered by the same collector\r\nin 1853, were forwarded to England with a living root, which latter\r\nhowever could not be made to grow.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1869, Mr. R. B. White obligingly communicated to us leaves\r\nand roots of a sarsaparilla collected at Patia in New Granada, which\r\napparently belongs to the same species.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Jamaica, there has been cultivated for many years,\r\nand of late with a view to medicinal use, a sarsaparilla plant which\r\nappears to be _Smilax officinalis_. The specimens transmitted to\r\nus[2626] include neither flowers nor fruits; but the leaves and square\r\nstem accord exactly with those of the plant collected at Bajorque. The\r\nroot is of a light cinnamon-brown, and far more amylaceous than the\r\nso-called _Jamaica Sarsaparilla_ of commerce (see p. 710).\r\n\r\n2. _Smilax medica_ Schl. et Cham.—This species,[2627] which was\r\ndiscovered in Mexico by Schiede in 1820, is without doubt the source of\r\nthe sarsaparilla shipped from Vera Cruz. According to our observations,\r\nit has a flexuose (or zigzag) stem, and much smaller foliage than\r\n_S. officinalis_; the leaves, though very variable, often assume an\r\nauriculate form, with broad, obtuse, basal lobes.\r\n\r\nIt grows on the eastern slopes of the Mexican Andes, and is the only\r\nspecies of that region of which the roots are collected. These,\r\naccording to Schiede, are dug up all the year round, dried in the sun\r\nand made into bundles.\r\n\r\n[2625] Kunth, _Synopsis Plant._ i. (1822) 278.—_Smilax officinalis_\r\nis a large, strong climber, attaining a height of 40 to 50 feet,\r\nwith a perfectly square stem armed with prickles at the angles. The\r\nleaves are often a foot in length, of variable form, being triangular,\r\novate-oblong, or oblong-lanceolate, either gradually narrowing towards\r\nthe apex or rounded and apiculate, and at the base either attenuated\r\ninto the petiole, or truncate, or cordate. They are usually 5-nerved,\r\nthe 3 inner nerves being prominent and enclosing an elliptic area. The\r\nflowers are in stalked umbels. A fine specimen of the plant is most\r\nluxuriantly growing since many years in the Royal Gardens, Kew, but has\r\nnot flowered.\r\n\r\n[2626] We owe them to the kindness of H. J. Kemble, Esq., who procured\r\nthem, with specimens of the root, from the Government garden at\r\nCastleton.\r\n\r\n[2627] Figured in Nees von Esenbeck’s _Plantæ Medicinales_, suppl. tab.\r\n7.\r\n\r\nDoubt and confusion hang over the other species of _Smilax_ which have\r\nbeen quoted as the sources of sarsaparilla. _S. syphilitica_ H.B.K.,\r\nwith flowers in a raceme of umbels, discovered on the Cassiquiare in\r\nNew Granada, and well figured by Berg and Schmidt from an authentic\r\nspecimen, appears from Pöppig’s statements to yield some of the\r\nsarsaparilla shipped at Pará. But Kunth states that Pöppig’s plant,\r\ngathered near Ega, is not that of Humboldt and Bonpland. Spruce, who\r\ncollected _S. syphilitica_ (herb. No. 3779) in descending the Rio Negro\r\nin 1854, has informed us that the Indians in various places in the\r\nAmazon valley always strenuously asserted it to be a species worthless\r\nfor “_Salsa_.”\r\n\r\n_S. papyracea_, described by Poiret[2628] in 1804, and figured by\r\nMartius,[2629] is but very imperfectly known. It has foliage resembling\r\nthat of _S. officinalis_, but, judging from Spruce’s specimens (No.\r\n1871) collected on the Rio Negro, a _multangular_ stem. It is probably\r\nthe source of the _Pará Sarsaparilla_.\r\n\r\n_S. cordato-ovata_ Rich. is a doubtful plant, perhaps identical with\r\n_S. Schomburgkiana_ Knth., a Panama species. Pöppig alleges that its\r\nroot is mixed with that of the plant which he calls _S. syphilitica_.\r\n\r\n_S. Purhampuy_ Ruiz, a Peruvian species, said to afford a valuable\r\nsort of sarsaparilla, is practically unknown, and is not admitted by\r\nKunth.[2630]\r\n\r\nNo new information on the several above mentioned species of Smilax is\r\nfound in the review of this genus by A. and C. De Candolle,[2631] where\r\n105 American species are enumerated.\r\n\r\n=History=—Monardes[2632] has recorded that sarsaparilla was first\r\nintroduced to Seville about the year 1536 or 1545, from New Spain; and\r\na better variety soon afterwards from Honduras. He further narrates\r\nthat a drug of excellent quality was subsequently imported from the\r\nprovince of Quito, that it was collected in the neighbourhood of\r\nGuayaquil, and was of a dark hue, and larger and thicker than that of\r\nHonduras.\r\n\r\nPedro de Cieza de Leon, in his Chronicle of Peru,[2633] which contains\r\nthe observations made by him in South America between 1532 and 1550,\r\ngives a particular account of the sarsaparilla which grows in the\r\nprovince of Guayaquil and the adjacent island of Puna, and recommends\r\nthe sudorific treatment of syphilis, exactly as pursued at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThese statements are confirmed by the testimony of other writers.\r\nThus, João Rodriguez de Castello Branco, commonly known as Amatus\r\nLusitanus, a Portuguese physician of Jewish origin, who practised\r\nchiefly in Italy, has left a work recording his medical experiences\r\nand narrating cases of successful treatment.[2634] One of the latter\r\nconcerns a patient suffering from acute rheumatism, for whom he finally\r\nprescribed _Sarsaparilla_. This drug, he explains, has of late years\r\nbeen brought from the newly found country of Peru, that it is in long\r\nwhip-like roots, growing from the stock of a sort of bramble resembling\r\na vine, that the Spaniards call it _Zarza parrilla_, and that it is an\r\nexcellent medicine.\r\n\r\n[2628] Lamarck, _Encyclopédie méthodique_, Bot., vi. 1804. 468.\r\n\r\n[2629] _Flor. Bras._ i. (1842-71) tab. 1.\r\n\r\n[2630] It must not be supposed that _all_ species of _Smilax_ are\r\ncapable of furnishing the drug. There are many, even South American,\r\nwhich like the _S. aspera_ of Europe, have _thin, wiry_ roots, which\r\nwould never pass for medicinal sarsaparilla.\r\n\r\n[2631] _Monographiæ phanerogamarum_, i. (1878) 6-199.\r\n\r\n[2632] Pages 18 and 88 of the work quoted in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[2633] _Parte primera de la Chronica del Peru_, Sevilla, 1553, folio\r\nlxix.—a translation for the Hakluyt Society in 1864, by Markham, who\r\nobserves that Cieza de Leon never himself visited Guayaquil.\r\n\r\n[2634] _Curationum medicinalium centuriæ quatuor_, Basileæ, 1556. 365.\r\n\r\nAbout the same period, sarsaparilla was described by Auger\r\nFerrier,[2635] a physician of Toulouse, who states that in the\r\ntreatment of syphilis, which he calls _Lues Hispanica_, it is believed\r\nto be better than either _China root_ or _Lignum sanctum_. Girolamo\r\nCardano of Milan, in a little work called _De radice Cina et Sarza\r\nParilia judicium_,[2636] expresses similar opinions. After so strong\r\nrecommendations, the drug soon found its way to the pharmaceutical\r\nstores; we find it quoted for instance in 1563, in the tariff of the\r\n“Apotheke” of the little town of Annaberg in Saxony.[2637] We have\r\nalso noticed “Sarsaparilla” in the _Ricettario Fiorentino_ of the year\r\n1573.[2638] Gerarde,[2639] who wrote about the close of the century,\r\nstates that the sarsaparilla of Peru is imported into England in\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\n=Collection of the Root=—Mr. Richard Spruce, the enterprising botanical\r\nexplorer of the Amazon valley, has communicated to us the following\r\nparticulars on this subject, which we give in his own graphic words:—\r\n\r\n“When I was at Santarem on the Amazon in 1849-50, where considerable\r\nquantities of sarsaparilla are brought in from the upper regions of\r\nthe river Tapajóz, and again when on the Upper Rio Negro and Uaupés\r\nin 1851-53, I often interrogated the traders about their criteria of\r\nthe good kinds of sarsaparilla. Some of them had bought their stock\r\nof Indians of the forest, and had themselves no certain test of its\r\ngenuineness or of its excellence, beyond the size of the roots, the\r\nthickest fetching the best price at Pará. Those who had gathered\r\nsarsaparilla for themselves were guided by the following characters:—1.\r\nMany stems from a root. 2. Prickles closely set. 3. Leaves thin.—The\r\nfirst character was (to them) alone essential, for in the species of\r\n_Smilax_ that have solitary stems, or not more than two or three,\r\nthe roots are so few as not to be worth grubbing up; whereas the\r\nmulticaul species have numerous long roots,—three at least to each\r\nstem,—extending horizontally on all sides.\r\n\r\n“In 1851, when I was at the falls of the Rio Negro, which are crossed\r\nby the equator, nine men started from the village of St. Gabriel to\r\ngather _Salsa_, as they called it, at the head of the river Cauaburís.\r\nDuring their absence I made the acquaintance of an old Indian, who\r\ntold me that four years ago he had brought stools of _Salsa_ from the\r\nCauaburís and had planted them in a _tabocál_,—a clump of bamboos,\r\nindicating the site of an ancient Indian village,—on the other side of\r\nthe falls, whither he invited me to go and witness the gathering of\r\nhis first crop of roots. On the 23rd March, I visited the _tabocál_,\r\nand found some half-dozen plants of a _Smilax_ with very prickly\r\nstems, but no flowers or fruit. At my request the Indian operated on\r\nthe finest plant first. It had five stems from the crown, and numerous\r\nroots about 9 feet long, radiating horizontally on all sides. The thin\r\ncovering of earth was first scraped away from the roots by hand, aided\r\nby a pointed stick; and had the _salsa_ been the only plant occupying\r\nthe ground, the task would have been easy. But the roots of the _salsa_\r\nwere often difficult to trace among those of bamboo and other plants,\r\nwhich had to be cut through with a knife whenever they came in the way.\r\nThe roots being at length all laid bare—(in this case it was the work\r\nof half a day, but with large plants it sometimes takes up a whole day\r\nor even more)—they were cut off near the crown, a few slender ones\r\nbeing allowed to remain, to aid the plant in renewing its growth. The\r\nstems also were shortened down to near the ground, and a little earth\r\nand dead leaves heaped over the crown, which would soon shoot out new\r\nstems.\r\n\r\n[2635] _De Pudendagra lue Hispanica, libri duo_, first published at\r\nToulouse in 1553, and many times reprinted. We have consulted the\r\nAntwerp edition of 1564, with which Cardano’s work is printed. The\r\nlatter is said to have first appeared in 1559.\r\n\r\n[2636] Basileæ, 1559, fol.\r\n\r\n[2637] Flückiger, _Documente_ (quoted at p. 404, note 7) 24.\r\n\r\n[2638] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[2639] _Herball_, enlarged by Johnson, 1636. 859.\r\n\r\n“The yield of this plant, of four years’ growth, was 16 lb.—half a\r\nPortuguese _arroba_—of roots; but a well grown plant will afford at the\r\nfirst cutting from one to two arrobas. In a couple of years, a plant\r\nmay be cut again, but the yield will be much smaller and the roots more\r\nslender and less starchy.”\r\n\r\n=General Description=—The medicinal species of _Smilax_ have a thick,\r\nshort, knotty rhizome, called by the druggists _chump_, from which grow\r\nin a horizontal direction long fleshy roots, from about the thickness\r\nof a quill to that of the little finger. These roots are mostly simple,\r\nforked only towards their extremities, beset with thread-like branching\r\nrootlets of nearly uniform size, which however are not emitted to any\r\ngreat extent from the more slender part of the root near the stock.\r\nWhen fresh the root is plump,[2640] but as found in commerce in the\r\ndried state it is more or less furrowed longitudinally, at least in the\r\nvicinity of the rhizome. When examined with a good lens both roots and\r\nrootlets may be seen in some specimens to be clothed with short velvety\r\nor shaggy hairs.\r\n\r\nThe presence or absence in greater or less abundance of starch in the\r\nbark of the root is regarded as an important criterion in estimating\r\nthe good quality of sarsaparilla. In England the non-amylaceous or\r\nnon-mealy roots are preferred, they alone being suitable for the\r\nmanufacture of the dark fluid extract that is valued by the public. On\r\nthe Continent, and especially in Italy, sarsaparilla, which when cut\r\nexhibits a thick bark, pure white within, is the esteemed kind.\r\n\r\nThe more or less plentiful occurrence of starch in the roots of\r\n_Smilax_ is a character which has no botanical significance, and\r\nappears, indeed, to vary in the same species. If one examines Jamaica\r\nsarsaparilla by shaving off a little of the bark, one finds a large\r\nmajority of roots to be non-amylaceous in their entire length; but\r\nothers can be picked out which, though non-amylaceous for some distance\r\nfrom the rhizome, acquire a starchy bark, which is _white_ internally\r\nin their middle and lower portions;—and there are still others which\r\nare slightly starchy even as they start from the parent rhizome,\r\nbecoming still more as they advance. In Guatemala sarsaparilla, which\r\nis considered a very mealy sort, it is easy to perceive that the bark\r\nis hardly amylaceous in the vicinity of the rhizome, but that it\r\nacquires an enormous deposit of fecula as it proceeds in its growth.\r\n\r\n[2640] We have been kindly permitted to examine the fresh root of the\r\nlarge plant of _Smilax officinalis_ in the Royal Gardens, Kew; and\r\nhave found that it agrees in appearance and in structure with Jamaica\r\nsarsaparilla.\r\n\r\nSarsaparilla varies greatly in the abundance of rootlets, technically\r\ncalled _beard_, with which the roots are clothed. This character\r\ndepends partly on natural circumstances, and partly on the practice\r\nof the collectors who remove or retain the rootlets at will. Dr. Rhys\r\nof Belize has stated that the proportion of rootlets depends much on\r\nthe nature of the soil, their development being most favoured by moist\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\nDry sarsaparilla has not much smell, yet when large quantities are\r\nboiled, or when a decoction is evaporated, a peculiar and very\r\nperceptible odour is emitted. The taste of the root is earthy, and not\r\nwell marked, and even a decoction has no very distinctive flavour.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=[2641]—On a _transverse section_ of the root,\r\nits fibro-vascular bundles are seen to be restricted to the central\r\npart, being all enclosed by a brown ring. Within this ring the bundles\r\nare densely packed so as to form a ligneous zone. The very centre\r\nof the section consists of white medullary tissue, through which\r\nsometimes a certain number of fibro-vascular bundles are scattered.\r\nA similar medullary parenchyme is met with between the brown ring or\r\nnucleus-sheath or the epidermis. On a _longitudinal section_ the latter\r\nexhibits several rows of elongated cells, having their outer brown\r\nwalls thickened by secondary deposits. The brown nucleus-sheath, on the\r\nother hand, consists of only one row of prismatic cells, their inner\r\nand lateral walls alone having secondary deposits. The vascular bundles\r\ncontain large scalariform vessels and lignified prosenchymatous cells.\r\n\r\nThe parenchymatous cells, if not devoid of solid contents, are loaded\r\nwith large compound starch granules; some cells also exhibit bundles\r\nof acicular crystals of calcium oxalate. In non-mealy sarsaparilla the\r\nvessels and ligneous cells sometimes contain a yellow resin.\r\n\r\nThe various sorts of sarsaparilla differ, not only in being mealy or\r\nnon-mealy, but also as regards the thickness of the ligneous zone,\r\nwhich in some of them is many times thinner than the diameter of\r\nthe central medullary tissue. In other kinds this diameter is very\r\nmuch smaller. Yet the nucleus-sheath affords still better means for\r\ndistinguishing the sorts of this drug, if we examine its single cells\r\nin a transverse section. The outline of such a cell may be of a square\r\nor somewhat rounded shape, or it may be more or less extended. In\r\nthis case it may be extended in the direction of a radius, or in the\r\ndirection of a tangent. The secondary deposits may vary in thickness.\r\n\r\n=Sorts of Sarsaparilla=—In the present state of our knowledge no\r\nbotanical classification of the different kinds of sarsaparilla being\r\npossible, we shall resort to the arrangement adopted by Pereira and\r\nplace them in two groups,—the _mealy_, or those of which starch is a\r\nprevalent constituent, and the _non-mealy_, or those in which starch\r\nexists to a comparatively small extent.\r\n\r\n[2641] For more particulars consult Vandercolme, _Histoire bot. et\r\nthérapeut. des Salsepareilles_, Paris, 1870, 127 pp., 3 plates; and\r\nOtten, in Dragendorff’s _Jahresbericht_, 1876. 74.\r\n\r\n(A.) _Mealy Sarsaparillas._\r\n\r\n1. _Honduras Sarsaparilla_—This drug is exported from Belize. It is\r\nmade up in hanks or rolls about 30 inches long and 2½ to 4 inches or\r\nmore in diameter, closely wound round with a long root so as to form a\r\nneat bundle. The hanks are united into bales by large pieces of hide,\r\nplaced at top and bottom, and held together with thongs of the same,\r\nfurther strengthened with iron hoops.\r\n\r\nThe roots are deeply furrowed, or sometimes plump and smooth, more or\r\nless provided with _beard_ or rootlets. In a very large proportion of\r\ntheir length they exhibit when cut a thick bark loaded with starch; yet\r\nin those parts which are near the rhizome the bark is brown, resinous,\r\nand non-amylaceous. They are of a pale brown, sometimes verging into\r\norange. But the drug is subject to great variation, so that it is\r\nimpossible to lay down absolutely distinctive characters.\r\n\r\nThe annual imports into the United Kingdom of sarsaparilla from British\r\nHonduras during the five years ending with 1870 averaged about 52,000\r\nlb.\r\n\r\n2. _Guatemala Sarsaparilla_—This sort of sarsaparilla, which first\r\nappeared in commerce about 1852, resembles the Honduras kind in\r\nmany of its characters, and is packed in a similar manner. But it\r\nhas a more decided _orange hue_; the roots as they start from the\r\nrhizome are lean, shrunken, and but little starchy, but they become\r\ngradually stouter (³/₁₀ inch diam.), and acquire a thick bark, which\r\nis internally very white and mealy. There is a tendency in the bark of\r\nthis sarsaparilla to crack and split off, so that bare spaces showing\r\nthe central woody column are not unfrequent.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bentley,[2642] who examined specimens of the plant, this\r\ndrug is derived from _Smilax papyracea_; we are not prepared to agree\r\nin this opinion.\r\n\r\n3. _Brazilian, Para or Lisbon Sarsaparilla_—Though formerly held in\r\nhigh esteem Brazilian sarsaparilla is not now appreciated in England,\r\nand is rarely seen in the London market.[2643] It is packed in a\r\nvery distinctive manner, the roots being tightly compressed into a\r\ncylindrical bundle, 3 feet or more in length and about 6 inches in\r\ndiameter, firmly held together by the flexible stem of a bignoniaceous\r\nplant, closely wound round them, the ends being neatly shaved off.\r\n\r\n[2642] _Pharm. Journ._ xii. (1853) 470, with figure.\r\n\r\n[2643] We noticed 66 rolls of it from Pará, offered for sale 15 Dec.\r\n1853.—D. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n(B.) _Non-mealy Sarsaparillas._\r\n\r\n4. _Jamaica Sarsaparilla_—To the English druggist this is the most\r\nimportant variety; it is that which appears to have the greatest claim\r\nto possess some medicinal activity, and it is the only sort admitted\r\nto the _British Pharmacopœia_. Although constantly called _Jamaica\r\nsarsaparilla_, it is well known that it only bears the name of Jamaica\r\nthrough having been formerly shipped from Central America by way of\r\nthat island.[2644] At the commencement of the last century, Jamaica was\r\nan emporium for sarsaparilla, great quantities of which, according to\r\nSloane,[2645] were brought thither from Honduras, New Spain and Peru.\r\nIts actual place of growth, according to De Warszewicz (1851), is the\r\nmountain range known as the Cordillera of Chiriqui, in that part of the\r\nisthmus of Panama adjoining the republic of Costa Rica: here the plant\r\ngrows at an elevation of 4000 to 8000 feet above the level of the sea.\r\nThe root is brought by the natives to Boca del Toro on the Atlantic\r\ncoast for shipment.\r\n\r\nThe drug consists of roots, 6 feet or more in length, bent repeatedly\r\nso as to form bundles of 18 inches long, and 4 in diameter, which\r\nare secured by being twined round (but less trimly and closely than\r\nthe Honduras sort) with a long root of the same drug. The rhizome is\r\nentirely absent, but the fibre or beard is preserved, and is reckoned a\r\nvaluable portion of the drug. The roots are deeply furrowed, shrunken,\r\nand generally more slender than in the Honduras kind; the bark when\r\nshaved off with a penknife is seen to be brown, hard and non-mealy\r\nthroughout. Yet it is by no means uncommon to find roots which have a\r\nsmooth bark rich in starch. In colour, Jamaica sarsaparilla varies from\r\na pale earthy brown to a deeper more ferruginous hue, the latter tint\r\nbeing the most esteemed.\r\n\r\nThe sarsaparilla referred to at p. 704 as grown in the island of\r\nJamaica, is a well prepared drug, yet so pale in colour and so\r\namylaceous, that it finds but little favour in the English market.\r\nThere were exported of it from Jamaica in 1870, 1747 lb.,[2646] in\r\n1871, 1290 lb.\r\n\r\n5. _Mexican Sarsaparilla_—The roots of this variety are not made into\r\nbundles, but are packed in straight lengths of about 3 feet into bales,\r\nthe chump and portion of an angular (but not _square_) thorny stem\r\nbeing frequently retained. The roots are of a pale, dull brown, lean,\r\nshrivelled, and with but few fibres. When thick and large, they have\r\na somewhat starchy bark, but when thin and near the rhizome, they are\r\nnon-amylaceous.\r\n\r\n6. _Guayaquil Sarsaparilla_—An esteemed kind of sarsaparilla has long\r\nbeen exported from Guayaquil (p. 705). Mr. Spruce has informed us that\r\nit is obtained in most of the valleys that debouch into the plain on\r\nthe western side of the Equatorial Andes, but chiefly in the valley\r\nof Alausi, where, in 1859, he saw plants of it at the junction of the\r\nsmall river Puma-cocha with the Yaguachi. The plant appears to be very\r\nproductive, an instance being on record of as much as 75 lb. of fresh\r\nroots having been obtained from a single stock.[2647]\r\n\r\n[2644] The connexion between Jamaica and Central America dates back\r\nfrom the time of Charles II., during whose reign (1661-85), the king of\r\nthe Mosquito Territory, a district never conquered by the Spaniards,\r\napplied to the governor of Jamaica for protection, which was accorded.\r\nThe protectorate lasted until 1860, when Mosquitia was ceded to the\r\ngovernment of Nicaragua.\r\n\r\n[2645] _Nat.

(1860) 185.\r\n\r\nGuayaquil sarsaparilla differs considerably from the sorts previously\r\nnoticed. It is rudely packed in large bales, and is not generally made\r\ninto separate hanks. The rhizome (chump) and a portion of the stem are\r\noften present, the latter being _round_ and not prickly. The root is\r\ndark, large and coarse-looking, with a good deal of fibre. The bark is\r\nfurrowed, rather thick, and not mealy in the slenderer portions of the\r\nroot which is near the rootstock; but as the root becomes stout, so its\r\nbark becomes smoother, thicker and amylaceous, exhibiting when cut a\r\nfawn-coloured or pale yellow interior.\r\n\r\nThe quantity exported from Guayaquil in 1871 was 1017 quintals, value\r\n£3814.[2648]\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Galileo Pallotta, at Naples, in 1824, first\r\nattempted to obtain from sarsaparilla a peculiar principle, which he\r\nbelieved to be an alkaloid, and termed _Pariglina_, or as now written\r\n_Parillin_. He exhausted the crude drug with boiling water and mixed\r\nthe decoction with milk of lime, whereby a greyish precipitate was\r\nproduced. This was dried, and treated with hot alcohol which extracted\r\nthe parillin. Pallotta says the substance slightly reddens litmus,\r\nbut does not explicitly state whether he got it in crystals or not.\r\nBerzelius in 1826 replaced the name pariglina by _Smilacin_. The same\r\nsubstance was obtained, more or less pure, by Thubeuf in 1831 and\r\ncalled _Salseparin_; Batka in 1833 termed it _Parillinic acid_. We\r\nhave isolated parillin[2649] by exhausting Mexican sarsaparilla with\r\nboiling alcohol, 0·835 sp. gr., and evaporating the tincture to ⅙ of\r\nthe weight of the root. By diluting 2 parts of the residue with 3 parts\r\nof cold water, a yellowish deposit of crude parillin is formed and may\r\nbe separated after a few days by decantation. The deposit is then mixed\r\nwith about half a volume of strong alcohol, now filtered and washed\r\nwith dilute alcohol, about 0·965 sp. gr. It may further be purified\r\nby repeated recrystallization from dilute alcohol and the use of a\r\nlittle charcoal. The yield is about 0·19 per cent. of perfectly white\r\ncrystallized parillin; a little more may be removed from the washings,\r\nbut with much difficulty. These liquids and the mother-liquors may be\r\nconcentrated and boiled with a little sulphuric acid in order to afford\r\nparigenin.\r\n\r\n[2648] Vice-Consul Smith on the commerce of Ecuador—_Consular Reports_,\r\npresented to Parliament, July, 1872.\r\n\r\n[2649] _Yearbook of Pharm._ 1878. 136.\r\n\r\nParillin forms brilliant scales, or can be obtained in thin prisms from\r\nboiling alcohol 0·965 sp. gr. Parillin is almost insoluble in cold\r\nwater, but dissolves in 20 parts of boiling water. On cooling, the\r\nlatter solution affords no crystals; an abundance of them are however\r\nproduced on addition of alcohol. Parillin is also soluble in 25 parts\r\nof alcohol, 0·814 sp. gr., at 25° C., and much more abundantly in\r\nboiling alcohol, from which it partly separates in crystals on cooling.\r\nIn both absolute alcohol or water, parillin is less soluble than in\r\ndilute alcohol. Hence aqueous solutions are precipitated by absolute\r\nalcohol, and parillin, on the other hand, separates from alcoholic\r\nsolutions on addition of cold water. With chloroform, parillin yields a\r\nviscid solution which affords no crystals.\r\n\r\nThe alcoholic solutions of parillin have a somewhat acrid taste, and\r\nare devoid of rotatory power.\r\n\r\nBy dilute mineral acids, parillin is resolved into _Parigenin_ and\r\nsugar; the liquid gradually acquires a dingy brown or greenish hue and\r\nfluorescence, which is most obvious if parillin dissolved in chloroform\r\nis decomposed by hydrochloric gas. Parigenin is easily isolated; it is\r\ninsoluble even in boiling water, but crystallizes in white scales from\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nThe composition of parillin and parigenin is not settled; the former\r\nbelongs to the class of saponin. Yet parillin differs from saponin as\r\ncontained in Saponaria or Quillaja[2650] by not being sternutatory; its\r\nsolutions froth when shaken.\r\n\r\nThe presence in sarsaparilla of starch, resin, and calcium oxalate, as\r\nrevealed by the microscope, has been already pointed out. Pereira[2651]\r\nexamined the _essential oil_, which is heavier than water and has the\r\nodour and taste of the drug; 140 lb. of Jamaica sarsaparilla afforded\r\nof it only a few drops.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the dark extractive matter which water removes from\r\nthe root in abundance, and the proportion of which is considered by\r\ndruggists a criterion of goodness, has not been studied.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The importation of sarsaparilla into the United Kingdom in\r\n1870 (later than which year we have no returns) amounted to 345,907\r\nlb., valued at £26,564.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Sarsaparilla is regarded by many as a valuable alterative and\r\ntonic, but by others as possessing little if any remedial powers. It is\r\nstill much employed, though by no means so extensively as a few years\r\nago. The preparations most in use are those obtained by a prolonged\r\nboiling of the root in water.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBER CHINÆ.\r\n\r\n_Radix Chinæ_; _China Root_; F. _Squine_; G. _Chinawurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Smilax China_ L., a woody, thorny, climbing\r\nshrub, is commonly said to afford this drug. The plant is a native\r\nof Japan, the Loochoo islands, Formosa, China, Cochin China, also of\r\nEastern India, as Kasia, Assam, Sikkim, Nepal. The chief authority for\r\nattributing the China root to this plant is Kämpfer, who saw the latter\r\nin Japan and figured it.[2652]\r\n\r\n_S. glabra_ Roxb. and _S. lanceæfolia_ Roxb., natives of India and\r\nSouthern China, have tubers which, according to Roxburgh, cannot be\r\ndistinguished from the China root of medicine, though the plants are\r\nperfectly distinct in appearance from _S. China_. Dr. Hance,[2653] of\r\nWhampoa, received a living specimen of China root, which proved to be\r\nthat of _S. glabra_. The three above-named species all grow in the\r\nisland of Hongkong.\r\n\r\n[2650] See Christophson, in Dragendorff’s _Jahresbericht_, 1874. 155.\r\n\r\n[2651] _Elements of Mat. Med._ ii.

Garcia de\r\nOrta, who makes this statement, further narrates that so great was the\r\nreputation of the new drug, that the small quantities first brought to\r\nMalacca were sold at the rate of 10 crowns per _ganta_, a weight of 24\r\nounces.\r\n\r\nPossibly the drug found its way to Europe even before that year, for\r\nwe find a careful description of it in the posthumous works[2654] of\r\nValerius Cordus and Walther Ryff[2655] states in 1548 that the root was\r\nbrought a few years ago to Venice.\r\n\r\nThe reported good effects of China root on the Emperor Charles V. who\r\nwas suffering from gout, acquired for the drug a great celebrity in\r\nEurope, and several works[2656] were written in praise of its virtues.\r\nBut though its powers were soon found to have been greatly overrated,\r\nit still retained some reputation as a sudorific and alterative,\r\nand was much used at the end of the 17th century in the same way as\r\nsarsaparilla. It still retains a place in some modern pharmacopœias.\r\n\r\n[2654] Edit. by Conrad Gesner, fol. 212 of the work quoted in the\r\nAppendix.\r\n\r\n[2655] ... _Bericht der Natur ... der Wurtzel China_, Würzburg, 1548.\r\n4°.\r\n\r\n[2656] The earliest of which is by Andreas Vesalius, _Epistola\r\nrationem, modumque pro pinandi radicis_ Chymae (sic!) _decocti, quo\r\nnuper invictissimus Carolus V. imperator usus est_, Venet., 1546.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The plant produces stout fibrous roots, here and there\r\nthickened into large tubers, which when dried become the drug China\r\nroot. These tubers, as found in the market, are of irregularly\r\ncylindrical form, usually a little flattened, sometimes producing short\r\nknobby branches. They are from about 4 to 6 or more inches in length,\r\nand 1 to 2 inches in thickness, covered with a rusty-coloured, rather\r\nshining bark, which in some specimens is smooth and in others more or\r\nless wrinkled. They have no distinct traces of rudimentary leaves,\r\nwhich however are perceptible on those of some allied species. Some\r\nstill retain portions of the cord-like woody runners on which they\r\ngrew; the bases of a few roots can also be observed. The tubers mostly\r\nshow marks of having been trimmed with a knife.\r\n\r\nChina root is inodorous and almost insipid. A transverse section\r\nexhibits the interior as a dense granular substance of a pale fawn\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The outermost cortical layer is made up of\r\nbrown, thick-walled cells, tangentially-extended. They enclose numerous\r\ntufts of needle-shaped crystals of calcium oxalate, and reddish-brown\r\nmasses of resin. The bark is at once succeeded by the inner parenchyme\r\nwhich contrasts strongly with it, consisting of large, thin-walled,\r\nporous cells which are completely gorged with starch, but here and\r\nthere contain colouring matter and bundles of crystals. The starch\r\ngranules are large (up to 50 mkm.), spherical, often flattened and\r\nangular from mutual pressure. Like those of colchicum, they exhibit\r\na radiate hilum: very frequently they have burst and run together,\r\nprobably in consequence of the tubers having been scalded. The vascular\r\nbundles scattered through the parenchyme, contain usually two large\r\nscalariform or reticulated vessels, a string of delicate thin-walled\r\nparenchyme, and elegant wood-cells with distinct incrusting layers and\r\nlinear pores.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The drug is not known to contain any substance\r\nto which its supposed medicinal virtues can be referred. We have\r\nendeavoured to obtain from it _Parillin_, the crystalline principle of\r\nsarsaparilla, but without success.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—China root is imported into Europe from the South of\r\nChina—usually from Canton. The quantity shipped from that port in\r\n1872, was only 384 peculs (51,200 lb.); while the same year there was\r\nshipped from Hankow, the great trading city of the Yangtsze, no less\r\nthan 10,258 peculs (1,367,733 lb.), all to Chinese ports. For the\r\nyear 1874, these figures were: Hankow 9393 peculs, valued at 53,194\r\ntaels (one tael about 5_s._ 10_d._), Kewkiang 3627 peculs, Ningpo 2905\r\npeculs,[2657] and for 1877 Hankow 12,075 peculs, Kewkiang 3942 peculs.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Notwithstanding the high opinion formerly entertained of the\r\nvirtues of China root, it has in England fallen into complete disuse.\r\nIn China and India it is still held in great esteem for the relief\r\nof rheumatic and syphilitic complaints, and as an aphrodisiac and\r\ndemulcent. Polak asserts that the tubers of _Smilax_ are consumed as\r\nfood by Turcomans and Mongols.[2658]\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—Several American species of _Smilax_ furnish a nearly\r\nallied drug, which at various times has been brought into commerce as\r\n_Radix Chinæ occidentalis_. It was already known to the authors of the\r\n16th century; we met with it in 1872, and before, in the London market,\r\nas an importation from Puntas Arenas, the port of Costa Rica on the\r\nPacific coast.\r\n\r\nOf the exact species it is difficult to speak with certainty: but\r\n_S. Pseudo-China_ L. and _S. tamnoides_ L. growing in the United\r\nStates from New Jersey southwards; _S. Balbisiana_ Knth., a plant\r\ncommon in all the West Indian Islands; and _S. Japicanga_ Griseb.,\r\n_S. syringoides_ Griseb. and _S. Brasiliensis_ Spreng., are reputed\r\nto afford large tuberous rhizomes which in their several localities\r\nreplace the China root of Asia, and are employed in a similar\r\nmanner.[2659]\r\n\r\n[2657] _Returns of Trade at the Treaty Ports in China for 1872_, pp.\r\n34, 154, and the same for 1874.\r\n\r\n[2658] See p. 324, note 2.—We quote this statement with reserve,\r\nknowing that both Chinese and Europeans sometimes confound China\r\nroot with the singular fungoid production termed _Pachyma Cocos_.\r\nThe first is called in Chinese _Tu-fuh-ling_,—the second _Fuh-ling_\r\nor _Pe-fuh-ling_.—See Hanbury, _Pharm.

The\r\njointed stem is from 6 to 12 feet high, solid, hard, dense, internally\r\njuicy, and hollow only in the flowering tops. Several varieties are\r\ncultivated, as the _Country Cane_, the original form of the species;\r\nthe _Ribbon Cane_, with purple or yellow stripes along the stem; the\r\n_Bourbon_ or _Tahiti Cane_, a more elongated, stronger, more hairy and\r\nvery productive variety. _Saccharum violaceum_ Tussac, the _Batavian\r\nCane_, is also considered to be a variety; but the large _S. chinense_\r\nRoxb. introduced from Canton in 1796 into the Botanic Gardens of\r\nCalcutta, may be a distinct species; it has a long, slender, erect\r\npanicle, while that of _S. officinarum_ is hairy and spreading, with\r\nthe ramifications alternate and more compound, not to mention other\r\ndifferences in the leaves and flowers.\r\n\r\nThe sugar cane is cultivated from cuttings, the small seeds very seldom\r\nripening. It succeeds in almost all tropical and subtropical countries,\r\nreaching in South America and Mexico an elevation above the sea of\r\n5000-6000 feet. It is cultivated in most parts of India and China up to\r\n30-31° N. lat, the mountainous regions excepted.\r\n\r\nFrom the elaborate investigations of Ritter,[2660] it appears that\r\n_Saccharum officinarum_ was originally a native of Bengal, and of the\r\nIndo-Chinese countries, as well as of Borneo, Java, Bali, Celebes, and\r\nother islands of the Malay Archipelago. But there is no evidence that\r\nit is now found any where in a wild state.\r\n\r\n=History=[2661]—The sugar cane was doubtless known in India from time\r\nimmemorial, and grown for food as it still is at the present day,\r\nchiefly in those regions which are unsuited for the manufacture of\r\nsugar.[2662]\r\n\r\nHerodotus, Theophrastus, Seneca, Strabo, and other early writers had\r\nsome knowledge of raw sugar, which they speak of as the _Honey of\r\nCanes_ or _Honey made by human hands_, not that of bees; but it was\r\nnot until the commencement of the Christian era, that the ancients\r\nmanifested an undoubted acquaintance with sugar, under the name of\r\n_Saccharon_.\r\n\r\nThus Dioscorides[2663] about A.D. 77 mentions the concreted honey\r\ncalled Σάκχαρον found upon canes (ὲπὶ τῶν καλάμων) in India and Arabia\r\nFelix, and which in substance and brittleness resemble salt. Pliny\r\nevidently knew the same thing under the name _Saccharum_; and the\r\nauthor of the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea, A.D. 54-68, states that\r\nhoney from canes, called σάκχαρι, is exported from Barygaza, in the\r\nGulf of Cambay, to the ports of the Red Sea, west of the _Promontorium\r\nAromatum_, that is to say to the coast opposite Aden. Whether at that\r\nperiod sugar was produced in Western India, or was brought thither from\r\nthe Ganges, is a point still doubtful.\r\n\r\n[2660] _Erdkunde von Asien_, ix. West-Asien, Berlin, 1840. pp. 230-291.\r\n\r\n[2661] The learned investigations of Heyd, _Levantehandel_, ii. (1879)\r\n665-667, afford exhaustive information about the medicinal history of\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n[2662] The production which the English translators of the Bible have\r\nrendered _Sweet Cane_, and which is alluded to by the prophets Isaiah\r\n(ch. xliii. 24) and Jeremiah (ch. vi. 20) as a commodity imported\r\nfrom a distant country, has been the subject of much discussion. Some\r\nhave supposed it to be the sugar cane; others, an aromatic grass\r\n(_Andropogon_). In our opinion, there is more reason to conclude that\r\nit was _Cassia Bark_.\r\n\r\n[2663] Lib. ii. c. 104.\r\n\r\nBengal is probably the country of the earliest manufacture of sugar;\r\nhence its names in all the languages of Western-Asiatic and European\r\nnations are derived from the Sanskrit _Sharkarā_, signifying a\r\nsubstance in the shape of small grains or stones. It is strange that\r\nthis word contains no allusion to the _taste_ of the substance.\r\n\r\n_Candy_, as sugar in large crystals is called, is derived from the\r\nArabic _Kand_ or _Kandat_, a name of the same signification. An old\r\nSanskrit name of Central Bengal is _Gura_, whence is derived the word\r\n_Gula_, meaning _raw sugar_, a term for sugar universally employed\r\nin the Malayan Archipelago, where on the other hand they have their\r\nown names for the sugar cane, although not for sugar. This fact again\r\nspeaks in favour of Ritter’s opinion, that the preparation of sugar\r\nin a dry crystalline state is due to the inhabitants of Bengal. Sugar\r\nunder the name of _Shi-mi_, i.e. _Stone-honey_, is frequently mentioned\r\nin the ancient Chinese annals among the productions of India and\r\nPersia; and it is recorded that the Emperor Tai-tsung, A.D. 627-650,\r\nsent an envoy to the kingdom of Magadha in India, the modern Bahar, to\r\nlearn the method of manufacturing sugar.[2664] The Chinese, in fact,\r\nacknowledge that the Indians between A.D. 766 and 780 were their first\r\nteachers in the art of refining sugar, for which they had no particular\r\nancient written character.\r\n\r\nAn Arabian writer, Abu Zayd al Hasan,[2665] informs us that about\r\nA.D. 850 the sugar cane was growing on the north-eastern shore of\r\nthe Persian Gulf; and in the following century, the traveller Ali\r\nIstakhri[2666] found sugar abundantly produced in the Persian province\r\nof Kuzistan, the ancient Susiana. About the same time (A.D. 950), Moses\r\nof Chorene, an Armenian, also stated that the manufacture of sugar was\r\nflourishing near the celebrated school of medicine at Jondisabur in the\r\nsame province, and remains of this industry in the shape of millstones,\r\n&c., still exist near Ahwas.\r\n\r\nPersian physicians of the 10th and 11th centuries, as Rhazes, Haly\r\nAbbas, and Avicenna, introduced sugar into medicine. The Arabs\r\ncultivated the sugar cane in many of their Mediterranean settlements,\r\nas Cyprus, Sicily, Italy, Northern Africa, and Spain. The Calendar of\r\nCordova[2667] shows that as early as A.D. 961 the cultivation was well\r\nunderstood in Spain, which is now the only country in Europe where\r\nsugar mills still exist.[2668]\r\n\r\nWilliam II., King of Sicily, presented in A.D. 1176 to the convent of\r\nMonreale mills for grinding cane, the culture of which still lingers at\r\nAvola near Syracuse, though only for the sake of making rum. In 1767,\r\nthe sugar plantations and sugar houses at this spot were described by a\r\ntraveller[2669] as “worth seeing.”\r\n\r\nDuring the middle ages England, in common with the rest of Northern\r\nEurope, was supplied with sugar from the Mediterranean countries,\r\nespecially Egypt and Cyprus. It was imported from Alexandria as early\r\nas the end of the 10th century by the Venetians, with whom it long\r\nremained an important article of trade. Thus we find[2670] that in\r\nA.D. 1319, a merchant in Venice, Tommaso Loredano, shipped to London\r\n100,000 lb. of sugar, the proceeds of which were to be returned in\r\n_wool_, which at that period constituted the great wealth of England.\r\nSugar was then very dear: thus from 1259 to 1350, the average price\r\nin England was about 1_s._ per lb., and from 1351 to 1400, 1_s._\r\n7_d._[2671] In France during the same period it must have been largely\r\nobtainable, though doubtless expensive. King John II. ordered in 1353\r\nthat the apothecaries of Paris should not use honey in making those\r\nconfections which ought to be prepared with the good white sugar called\r\n_cafetin_,[2672] a name alluding to the peculiar shape of the loaf\r\nwhich was not uncommon at that time.[2673]\r\n\r\n[2664] Bretschneider, _Chinese Botanical Works_, 1870. 46.\r\n\r\n[2665] Ritter, _l.c._ 286.\r\n\r\n[2666] P. 57 of the book quoted in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[2667] _Le Calendrier de Cordoue de l’année_ 961, par R.

Thus its introduction\r\ninto Madeira goes back as far as A.D. 1420; it reached St. Domingo in\r\n1494,[2675] the Canary Islands in 1503, Brazil in the beginning of\r\nthe 16th century, Mexico about 1520, Guiana about 1600, Guadaloupe in\r\n1644, Martinique in 1650,[2676] Mauritius towards 1750, Natal[2677] and\r\nNew South Wales, about 1852,[2678] while from a very early period the\r\nsugar cane had been propagated from the Indian Archipelago over all the\r\nislands of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe ancient cultivation in Egypt, probably never quite extinct, has\r\nbeen revived on an extensive scale by the Khedive Ismail Pasha. There\r\nwere 13 sugar factories, making raw sugar, belonging to the Egyptian\r\nGovernment at work in 1872, and about 100,000 acres of land devoted to\r\nsugar cane. The export of sugar from Egypt in 1872 reached 2 millions\r\nof _kantars_, or about 89,200 tons.[2679]\r\n\r\nThe imperfection of organic chemistry previous to the middle of the\r\n18th century, permitted no exact investigations into the chemical\r\nnature of sugar. Marggraf of Berlin[2680] proved in 1747 that sugar\r\noccurs in many vegetables, and succeeded in obtaining it in a pure\r\ncrystallized state from the juice of beet root. The enormous practical\r\nimportance of this discovery did not escape him, and he caused serious\r\nattempts to be made for rendering it available, which were so far\r\nsuccessful that the first manufactory of beet-sugar was established in\r\n1796 by Achard at Kunern in Silesia.\r\n\r\nThis new branch of industry[2681] was greatly promoted by the\r\nprohibitive measures, whereby Napoleon excluded colonial sugar from\r\nalmost the whole Continent; and it is now carried forward on such a\r\nscale that 640,000 to 680,000 tons of beet root sugar are annually\r\nproduced in Europe, the entire production of cane-sugar being estimated\r\nat 1,260,000 to 1,413,000 tons.[2682]\r\n\r\nAmong the British colonies, Mauritius,[2683] British Guiana,[2684]\r\nTrinidad,[2685] Barbados,[2686] and Jamaica,[2687] produce at present\r\nthe largest quantity of sugar.\r\n\r\n[2674] Yule, _Book of Ser Marco Polo_, ii.

The transverse section of the cane exhibits\r\nnumerous fibro-vascular bundles, scattered through the tissue, as in\r\nother monocotyledonous stems; yet these bundles are most abundant\r\ntowards the exterior, where they form a dense ring covered with a\r\nthin epidermis, which is very hard by reason of the silica which is\r\ndeposited in it.[2688] In the centre of the stem the vascular bundles\r\nare few in number; the parenchyme is far more abundant, and contains\r\nin its thin-walled cells an almost clear solution of sugar, with a few\r\nsmall starch granules and a little soluble albuminous matter. This last\r\nis met with in larger quantity in the cambial portion of the vascular\r\nbundles. Pectic principles are combined with the walls of the medullary\r\ncells, which however do not swell much in water (Wiesner).\r\n\r\nFrom these glances at the microscopical structure of the cane, the\r\nprocess to be followed for obtaining the largest possible quantity\r\nof sugar becomes evident. This would consist in simply macerating\r\nthin slices of the cane in water, which would at once penetrate the\r\nparenchyme loaded with sugar, without much attacking the fibro-vascular\r\nbundles containing more of albuminous than of saccharine matter.\r\nBy this method, the epidermal layer of the cane would not become\r\nsaturated with sugar, nor would it impede its extraction,—results which\r\nnecessarily follow when the cane is crushed and pressed.[2689]\r\n\r\nThe process hitherto generally practised in the colonies,—that of\r\nextracting the juice of the cane by crushing and pressing,—has been\r\nelaborately described and criticised by Dr. Icery of Mauritius.[2690]\r\nIn that island, the cane, six varieties of which are cultivated, is\r\nwhen mature composed of _Cellulose_, 8 to 12 per cent.; _Sugar_, 18\r\nto 21; _Water_, including albuminous matter and salts, 67 to 73. Of\r\nthe entire quantity of juice in the cane, from 70 to 84 per cent. is\r\nextracted for evaporation, and yields in a crystalline state about\r\nthree-fifths of the sugar which the cane originally contained. This\r\njuice, called in French _vesou_, has on an average the following\r\ncomposition:—\r\n\r\n    Albuminous matters                     0·03\r\n    Granular matter (starch?)              0·10\r\n    Mucilage containing nitrogen           0·22\r\n    Salts, mostly of organic acids[2691]   0·29\r\n    Sugar                                 18·36\r\n    Water                                 81·00\r\n                                         ------\r\n                                         100·00\r\n\r\n[2688] Stems of American sugar cane, dried at 100° C., yielded 4\r\nper cent of ash, nearly half of which was silica.—Popp, in Wiggers’\r\n_Jahresbericht_, 1870. 35.\r\n\r\n[2689] The plan of obtaining a syrup by macerating the sliced fresh\r\ncane, has been tried in Guadaloupe, but abandoned owing to some\r\npractical difficulties in exhausting the cane and in carrying on the\r\nevaporation of the liquors with sufficient rapidity. Experiments for\r\nextracting a pure syrup by means of cold water from the _sliced and\r\ndried_ cane, seem to promise good results.—See a paper by Dr. H. S.\r\nMitchell in _Journ. of Soc. of Arts_, Oct. 23, 1868.\r\n\r\n[2690] _Annales de Chimie et de Physique_, v.

The first two classes of the above enumerated substances\r\nrender the juice turbid, and greatly promote its fermentation, but they\r\neasily separate by boiling, and the juice may then be kept a short time\r\nwithout undergoing change. In many colonies the yield is said to be far\r\ninferior to what it should be; yet the juice is obtained in a state\r\nallowing of easier purification, when its extraction is not carried to\r\nthe furthest limit.\r\n\r\nIn beet root as well as in the sugar cane, cane-sugar only was\r\nsaid to be present; Icery however has proved that in the cane some\r\nuncrystallizable (inverted) sugar is always present. Its quantity\r\nvaries much, according to the places where the cane grows, and its age.\r\nThe tops of quick-growing young canes yielded a _vesou_ containing\r\n2·4 per cent. of uncrystallizable sugar; 3·6 of cane sugar; and 94\r\nof water. Moist and shady situations greatly promote the formation\r\nof the former kind of sugar, which also prevails in the tops,\r\nchiefly when immature. Hence that observer concludes that at first\r\nthe uncrystallizable variety of sugar is formed, and subsequently\r\ntransformed into cane-sugar by the force of vegetation, and especially\r\nby the influence of light. Perfectly ripened canes contain only ¹/₇₅ to\r\n¹/₅₀ of all their sugar in the uncrystallizable state.\r\n\r\n=Description and Chemical Composition=—Cane-sugar is the type of\r\na numerous class of well-defined organic compounds, of frequent\r\noccurrence throughout the vegetable and animal kingdoms, or\r\nartificially obtained by decomposing certain other substances; in the\r\nlatter case, however, glucose or some other sugar than cane-sugar is\r\nobtained. cane-sugar, C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁, or C₁₂H₁₄(OH)₈O₃, melts, without\r\nchange of composition, at 160° C., several other kinds of sugar giving\r\noff water, with which they form crystallized compounds at the ordinary\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nCane-sugar forms hard crystals of the oblique rhombic system, having\r\na sp. gr. of 1·59. Two parts are dissolved at 15° C. by one part of\r\nwater,[2692] and by much less at an elevated temperature; a slight\r\ndepression of the thermometer is observable in the former case. One\r\npart of sugar dissolved in one of water, forms a liquid of sp. gr.\r\n1·23; two of sugar in one of water, a liquid of sp. gr. 1·33. Sugar\r\nrequires 65 parts of spirit of wine (sp. gr. 0·84) or 80 parts of\r\nanhydrous alcohol for solution; ether does not act upon it.\r\n\r\n[2692] It is commonly stated that _three_ parts can be dissolved in one\r\nof cold water; but this is not the fact.\r\n\r\nA ray of polarized light is deviated by an aqueous solution of cane\r\nsugar to the _right_, but by some other kinds of sugar to the _left_,\r\nas first shown by Biot. These optical powers are highly important, both\r\nin the practical estimation of solutions of sugar, and in scientific\r\nstudies connected with sugar or saccharogenous substances. The\r\noptical as well as chemical properties of sugar are altered by many\r\ncircumstances, as the action of dilute acids or alkalis, or by the\r\ninfluence of minute fungi. Yeast occasions sugar to undergo alcoholic\r\nfermentation. Other ferments set up an action by which butyric, lactic\r\nor propionic acid are produced.\r\n\r\nCane-sugar is of a purer and sweeter taste than most other sugars.\r\nThough it does not alter litmus paper, yet with alkalis it forms\r\ncompounds some of which are crystallizable. From an alkaline solution\r\nof tartrate of copper, cane-sugar throws down no protoxide, unless\r\nafter boiling.\r\n\r\nIf sugar is kept a short time in a state of fusion at 160° C., it is\r\nconverted into one molecule of _Grape Sugar_ and one of _Levulosan_;\r\nthe former can be either isolated by crystallization or destroyed\r\nby fermentation, the latter being incapable of crystallizing or of\r\nundergoing fermentation.\r\n\r\nCane-sugar which has been melted at 160° C. is deliquescent and readily\r\nsoluble in anhydrous alcohol, and its rotatory power is diminished or\r\nentirely destroyed. It is no longer crystallizable, and its fusing\r\npoint has become reduced to about 93° C. Yet before undergoing these\r\nevident alterations, it assumes an amorphous condition if allowed to\r\nmelt with a third of its weight of water, becoming always a little\r\ncoloured by pyrogenous products. In the course of time, however, this\r\namorphous sugar loses its transparency and reassumes the crystalline\r\nform. Like sulphur and arsenious acid, it is capable of existing either\r\nin a crystallized or an amorphous state.\r\n\r\nIf sugar is heated to about 190° C. water is evolved, and we obtain\r\nthe dark brown products commonly called _Caramel_ or _Burnt Sugar_.\r\nThey are of a peculiar sharp flavour, of a bitter taste, incapable\r\nof fermenting and deliquescent. One of the constituents of caramel,\r\n_Caramelane_, C₁₂H₁₈O₉, has been obtained by Gélis (1862) perfectly\r\ncolourless. When the heat is augmented, the sugar at last suffers a\r\ndecomposition resembling that which produces tar (see p. 621), its\r\npyrogenous products being the same or very analogous to those of the\r\ndry distillation of wood.\r\n\r\n=Varieties of Cane-sugar=—The experiments of Marggraf referred to at\r\np. 717, note 9, showed that cane-sugar is by no means confined to the\r\nsugar cane; and it is in fact extracted on an extensive scale from\r\nseveral other plants, of which the following deserve mention:—\r\n\r\n_Beet Root_—The manufacture of cane-sugar from the fleshy root of a\r\ncultivated variety of _Beta maritima_ L., is now largely carried on in\r\nContinental Europe and in America, and with admirable results.\r\n\r\nOf fresh beet root, 100 parts contain on an average 80 per cent. of\r\nwater, 11 to 13 of cane-sugar, and about 7 per cent. of pectic and\r\nalbuminous matters, cellulose and salts. Of the total amount of juice\r\nwhich the root contains, eight-ninths are extracted; and by the best\r\nprocess now in practice, 8 to 9 parts of sugar from every 100 parts of\r\nfresh root. The yield of crystalline sugar is still on the increase,\r\nowing to continual improvements in the mechanical and chemical parts of\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\n_Palm_—Several species are of great utility for the production of the\r\nsugar called by Europeans _Jaggery_.[2693] This substance is obtained\r\nby the natives of India in the following manner:—The young growing\r\nspadix, or flowering shoot, of the palm is cut off near its apex; and\r\nan earthen vessel is tied on to the stump to receive the juice that\r\nflows out. This vessel is emptied daily; while to promote a continuous\r\nflow of sap, a thin slice is cut from the wounded end. The juice thus\r\ncollected, if at once boiled down, yields the crude brown sugar known\r\nas _jaggery_. If allowed to ferment, it becomes the inebriating drink\r\ncalled _Toddy_ or palm wine; or it may be converted into vinegar. The\r\nspirit distilled from toddy is _Arrack_.\r\n\r\n[2693] A word of Sanskrit origin, corrupted from the Canarese\r\n_sharkari_.\r\n\r\nOf the sugar-yielding palms of Asia, _Phœnix silvestris_ Roxb., which\r\nis supposed to be the wild form of the date palm, is one of the more\r\nimportant. The coco-nut palm, _Cocos nucifera_ L.; the magnificent\r\nPalmyra palm, _Borassua flabelliformis_ L.; and the Bastard Sago,\r\n_Caryota urens_ L., also furnish important quantities of sugar. In\r\nthe Indian Archipelago, sugar is obtained from the sap of _Arenga\r\nsaccharifera_ Mart., which grows there in abundance as well as in\r\nthe Philippines and the Indo-Chinese countries. It is also got from\r\n_Nipa fruticans_ Thunb., a tree of the low coast regions, extensively\r\ncultivated in Tavoy.\r\n\r\nDe Vry[2694] has advocated the manufacture of sugar from the palm as\r\nthe most philosophical, seeing that its juice is a nearly pure aqueous\r\nsolution of sugar: that as no mineral constituents are removed from the\r\nsoil in this juice, the costly manuring, as well as the laborious and\r\ndestructive processes required to eliminate the juice from such plants\r\nas the sugar cane and beet root, are avoided. And finally, that palms\r\nare perennial, and can many of them be cultivated on a soil unsuitable\r\nfor any cereal.\r\n\r\n_Maple_—In America, considerable quantities of sugar identical with\r\nthat of the cane are obtained in the woods of the Northern United\r\nStates and of Canada, by evaporating the juice of maples. The species\r\nchiefly employed are _Acer saccharinum_ Wangenh., the Common Sugar\r\nMaple, and its variety (var. _nigrum_) the Black Sugar Maple. _A.\r\nPennsylvanicum_ L., _A. Negundo_ L. (_Negundo aceroides_ Moench.) and\r\n_A. dasycarpum_ Ehrh. are also used; the sap of the last is said to be\r\nthe least saccharine.\r\n\r\nAs the juice of these trees yields not more than about 2 per cent. of\r\nsugar, it requires for its solidification a large expenditure of fuel.\r\nThe manufacture of maple sugar can therefore be advantageously carried\r\non only in countries remote from markets whence ordinary sugar can be\r\nprocured, or in regions where fuel is extremely plentiful. In North\r\nAmerica it flourishes only between 40° and 43° N. lat. We are not aware\r\nof any estimate of the total production of maple sugar. The Census of\r\nPennsylvania of 1870 gave the following figures as referring to its\r\nmanufacture in that State:—\r\n\r\n       1850             1860             1870\r\n    2,326,525 lb.    2,768,965 lb.    1,545,917 lb.[2695]\r\n\r\n_Sorghum_—Another plant of the same order as _Saccharum_ is _Sorghum\r\nsaccharatum_ Pers. (_Holcus saccharatus_ L.) a native of Northern\r\nChina,[2696] which has of late been much tried as a sugar-yielding\r\nplant both in Europe and North America; yet without any great success,\r\nas the purification of the sugar is accomplished with peculiar\r\ndifficulty. As in the sugar cane, there are in sorghum crystallizable\r\nand uncrystallizable sugars, the former being at its maximum amount\r\nwhen the grain reaches maturity. The importance of the plant however is\r\nrapidly increasing on account of the value of its leaves and grain as\r\nfood for horses and cattle, and of its stems which can be employed in\r\nthe manufacture of paper and of alcohol.\r\n\r\n[2694] _Journ. de Pharm._ i.

The dark\r\nuncrystallizable syrup, known in England as _Molasses_, _Golden Syrup_,\r\nand _Treacle_,[2697] and in foreign pharmacy as _Syrupus Hollandicus\r\nvel communis_, which is formed in the preparation of pure sugar by the\r\ninfluence of heat, alkaline bodies, microscopic vegetation, and the\r\noxygen of the air, is sometimes employed for making pill masses. The\r\ntreacle of colonial sugar alone is adapted for this purpose, that of\r\nbeet root having a disagreeable taste, and containing from 19 to 21 per\r\ncent. of oxalate, tartrate and malate of potassium, and only 56 to 64\r\nof sugar.[2698] The treacle of colonial sugar usually contains 5 to 7\r\nper cent. of salts.\r\n\r\n[2697] How the word _Treacle_ came to be transferred from its\r\napplication to an opiate medicine to become a name for _molasses_, we\r\nknow not. In the description of sugar-making given by Salmon in his\r\n_English Physician or Druggist’s Shop opened_, Lond. 1663, treacle is\r\nnever mentioned, but only “_melussas_.”\r\n\r\n[2698] Landolt, Zeitschr. _für analyt.

In Sweden its\r\ncultivation extends as far as 68° 38’ N. lat.; on the Norwegian coast\r\nup to the Altenfjord in 70° N. lat.; even in Lapland, it succeeds as\r\nhigh as 900 to 1350 feet above the level of the sea. In several of\r\nthe southern Swiss Alpine valleys, barley ripens at 5000 feet, and\r\nin the Himalaya at 11,000 feet. In the Equatorial Andes, where it is\r\nextensively grown, it thrives up to at least 11,000 feet above the sea.\r\nNo other cereal can be cultivated under so great a variety of climate.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bretschneider,[2699] barley is included among the five\r\ncereals which it is related in Chinese history were sowed by the\r\nEmperor Shen-nung, who reigned about 2700 B.C.; but it is not one of\r\nthe five sorts of grain which are used at the ceremony of ploughing and\r\nsowing as now annually performed by the emperors of China.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus was acquainted with several sorts of barley (Κριθή), and\r\namong them, with the six-rowed kind or _hexastichon_, which is the\r\nspecies that is represented on the coins struck at Metapontum[2700] in\r\nLucania, between the 6th and 2nd centuries B.C.\r\n\r\n[2699] _On Chinese Botanical Works_, etc., Foochow, 1870. 7. 8.\r\n\r\n[2700] Metapontum lay in the plain between the rivers Bradano and\r\nBasento in the gulf of Taranto.\r\n\r\nStrabo and Dioscorides in the 1st century allude to drinks made from\r\nbarley, which according to Tacitus were even then familiar to the\r\nGerman tribes, as they are known to have been still earlier to the\r\nGreeks and Egyptians.\r\n\r\nBarley is mentioned in the Bible as a plant of cultivation in Egypt\r\nand Syria, and must have been, among the ancient Hebrews, an important\r\narticle of food, judging from the quantity allowed by Solomon to the\r\nservants of Hiram, king of Tyre (B.C. 1015). The tribute of barley paid\r\nto King Jotham by the Ammonites (B.C. 741) is also exactly recorded.\r\nThe ancients were frequently in the practice of removing the hard\r\ninteguments of barley by roasting it, and using the torrefied grain as\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n=Manufacture=—For use in medicine and as food for the sick, barley\r\nis not employed in its crude state, but only when deprived more or\r\nless completely of its husk. The process by which this is effected\r\nis carried on in mills constructed for the purpose, and consists\r\nessentially in passing the grain between horizontal millstones, placed\r\nso far apart as to rub off its integuments without crushing it.\r\nBarley partially deprived of its husk is known as _Scotch_, _hulled_\r\nor _Pot Barley_. When by longer and closer grinding the whole of the\r\ninteguments have been removed, and the grain has become completely\r\nrounded, it is termed _Pearl Barley_. In the _British Pharmacopœia_ it\r\nis this sort alone which is ordered to be used.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Pearl Barley is in subspherical or somewhat ovoid grains\r\nabout 2 lines in diameter, of white farinaceous aspect, often partly\r\nyellowish from remains of the adhering husk, which is present on the\r\nsurface, as well as in the deep longitudinal furrow with which each\r\ngrain is indented. It has the farinaceous taste and odour which are\r\ncommon to most of the cereal grains.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The albumen which constitutes the main portion\r\nof the grain is composed of large thin-walled parenchyme, the cells of\r\nwhich on transverse section are seen to radiate from the furrow, and\r\nto be lengthened in that direction rather than longitudinally. In the\r\nvicinity of the furrow alone the tissue of the albumen is narrower. Its\r\npredominating large cells show a polygonal or oval outline, whilst the\r\nouter layer is built up of two, three or four rows of thick-walled,\r\ncoherent, nearly cubic gluten-cells. This layer, about 70 mkm. thick,\r\nis coated with an extremely thin brown tegument, to which succeeds a\r\nlayer about 30 mkm. thick, of densely packed, tabular, greyish or\r\nyellowish cells of very small size; this proper coat of the fruit in\r\nthe furrow is of rather spongy appearance.\r\n\r\nIn some varieties of barley the fruit is constituted of the above\r\ntissues alone and the shell, but in most the paleæ are likewise\r\npresent. They consist chiefly of long fibrous, thick-walled cells,\r\ntwo or four rows deep, constituting a very hard layer. On tranverse\r\nsection, this layer forms a coherent envelope about 35 mkm. thick; its\r\ncells when examined in longitudinal section show but a small lumen of\r\npeculiar undulated outline from secondary deposits.\r\n\r\nThe gluten-cells varying considerably in the different cereal grains,\r\nafford characters enough to distinguish them with certainty. In wheat,\r\nfor instance, the gluten-cells are in a single row, in rice they form a\r\ndouble or single row, but its cells are transversely lengthened.\r\n\r\nThe inner tissue of the albumen in barley is filled up with large\r\nirregularly lenticular, and with extremely small globular starch\r\ngranules, the first being 20 to 35 mkm., the latter 1, 2 to 3 mkm.\r\nin diameter, with no considerable number of intermediate size.\r\nThe concentric layers constituting the large granules may be made\r\nconspicuous by moistening with chromic acid.\r\n\r\nThe layer alluded to as being composed of _gluten-cells_ is loaded\r\nwith extremely small granules of albuminous matters (gluten), which\r\non addition of iodine are coloured intensely yellow. These granules,\r\nwhich, considering barley as an article of food, are of prominent\r\nvalue, are not confined to the gluten-cells, but the neighbouring\r\nstarch-cells also contain a small amount of them: and in the narrow\r\nzone of denser tissue projecting from the furrow into the albumen,\r\nprotein principles are equally deposited, as shown by the yellow\r\ncoloration which iodine produces.\r\n\r\nThe gluten-cells, the _membrane embroynnaire_ of Mège-Mouriès, contain\r\nalso, according to the researches on bread[2701] made by this chemist\r\n(1856), _Cerealin_, an albuminous principle soluble in water, which\r\ncauses the transformation of starch into dextrin, sugar, and lactic\r\nacid. In the husks (_épiderme_, _épicarpe_ and _endocarpe_) of wheat,\r\nMège-Mouriès found some volatile oil and a yellow extractive matter,\r\nto which, together with the cerealin, is due the acidity of bread made\r\nwith the flour containing the bran.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Barley has been submitted to careful analyses\r\nby many chemists, more especially by Lermer.[2702] The grains contain\r\nusually 13 to 15 per cent. of water; after drying, they yield to ether\r\n3 per cent. of fat oil, with insignificant proportions of tannic and\r\nbitter principles, residing chiefly in the husks. Lermer further found\r\nin the whole grains, 63 per cent. of starch, 7 of cellulose, 6·6 of\r\ndextrin, 2·5 of nitrogen, a small amount of lactic acid, and 2·4 of ash.\r\n\r\n[2701] He actually examined _wheat_, not barley; we assume the chemical\r\nconstitution of the two grains to be similar.\r\n\r\n[2702] Wittstein, _Vierteljahresschr. für prakt. Pharm._ xii. (1863)\r\n4-23.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of Poggiale (1856) gave nearly the same composition,\r\nnamely, water 15, oil 2·4, starch 60, cellulose 8·8, albuminous\r\nprinciples 10·7, ash 2·6.\r\n\r\nThe protein, or albuminous matter consists of different principles,\r\nchiefly insoluble in cold water. The soluble portion is partly\r\ncoagulated on boiling, partly retained in solution: 2·5 per cent. of\r\nnitrogen, as above, would answer to about 16 per cent. of albuminous\r\nmatters. Their soluble part seems to be deposited in the starch-cells,\r\nnext to the gluten-cells, which latter contain the insoluble portion.\r\n\r\nThe ash, according to Lermer, contains 29 per cent. of silicic acid,\r\n32·6 of phosphoric acid, 22·7 of potash, and only 3·7 of lime. In\r\nthe opinion of Salm-Horstmar, fluorine and lithia are indispensable\r\nconstituents of barley.\r\n\r\nThe fixed oil of barley, as proved in 1863 by Hanamann, is a compound\r\nof glycerin with either a mixture of palmitic and lauric acids, or\r\nless probably with a peculiar fatty acid. Beckmann’s _Hordeinic Acid_\r\nobtained in 1855 by distilling barley with sulphuric acid, is probably\r\nlauric acid. Lintner (1868) has shown barley to contain also a little\r\n_Cholesterin_ (p. 420).\r\n\r\nLastly, Kühnemann (1875) extracted from barley a crystallized\r\ndextrogyrate sugar, and (1876) an amorphous lævogyrate mucilaginous\r\nsubstance _Sinistrin_ (see p. 692); according to that chemist, dextrin\r\nis altogether wanting in barley.\r\n\r\nBarley when malted loses 7 per cent.; it then contains 10 to 12 per\r\ncent. of sugar, produced at the expense of the starch; before malting,\r\nno sugar is to be found.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Barley as a medicine is unimportant. A decoction is sometimes\r\nprescribed as a demulcent or as a diluent of active remedies. An\r\naqueous extract of malt has been employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLEUM ANDROPOGONIS.\r\n\r\n_Oleum Graminis Indici_; _Indian Grass Oil_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—Among the numerous species of _Andropogon_[2703]\r\nwhich have foliage abounding in essential oil, the following furnish\r\nthe fragrant _Grass Oils_ of commerce:—\r\n\r\n1. _Andropogon Nardus_ L.,[2704]—a noble-looking plant, rising when in\r\nflower to a height of 6 or more feet, extensively cultivated in Ceylon\r\nand Singapore for the production of _Citronella Oil_.\r\n\r\n2. _A. citratus_ D.C.,[2705] Lemon Grass,—a large coarse glaucous\r\ngrass, known only in a cultivated state, and very rarely producing\r\nflowers. It is grown in Ceylon and Singapore for the sake of its\r\nessential oil, which is called _Lemon Grass Oil_, _Oil of Verbena_\r\nor _Indian Melissa Oil_; it is also commonly met with in gardens\r\nthroughout India and is not unfrequent in English hothouses. In Java it\r\nis called _Sireh_.\r\n\r\n3. _A. Schœnanthus_ L.,[2706] a grass of Northern and Central India,\r\nhaving leaves rounded or slightly cordate at the base, yielding by\r\ndistillation the oil known as _Rúsa Oil_, _Oil of Ginger Grass_ or _of\r\nGeranium_.\r\n\r\n[2703] Major-General Munro has at our request investigated the\r\nbotanical characters of the fragrant species of _Andropogon_, and\r\nexamined a numerous suite of specimens in our possession. The synonyms\r\nin foot-notes are given upon his authority.\r\n\r\n[2704] _A. Martini_ Thwaites, _Enum. Plantarum Zeylaniæ_ nec\r\naliorum.—Fig. in Bentley and Trimen’s _Med.

Calamus aromaticus_ Royle, _Illustrations of\r\nBot. of Himalayan Mountains_, 1839. tab. 97.\r\n\r\n=History=—The aromatic properties of certain species of _Andropogon_\r\nwere well known to Rheede, Rumphius, and other early writers on Indian\r\nnatural history; and an oil distilled from the _Sireh_ grass in Amboyna\r\nwas known as a curiosity as early as 1717.[2707]\r\n\r\nBut it is only in very recent times that the volatile oils of these\r\nplants have become objects of commerce with Europe. Lemon grass oil\r\nis mentioned by Roxburgh in 1820 as being distilled in the Moluccas;\r\nand it was first imported into London about the year 1832. Citronella\r\noil is of much more recent introduction. Ginger grass oil, called in\r\nHindustani _Rúsa ka tel_, is stated by Waring[2708] to have been first\r\nbrought to notice by Dr. N. Maxwell in 1825.\r\n\r\n=Production=—Citronella and Lemon grass are cultivated about Galle and\r\nat Singapore, the same estate often producing both. The grasses are\r\ndistilled separately, the essential oils being regarded as entirely\r\ndistinct, and having different market values. In Ceylon they are cut\r\nfor distillation at any time of year, but mostly in December and\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nOn the Perseverance Estate at Gaylang, Singapore, belonging to Mr. John\r\nFisher, an area of 950 acres is cultivated with aromatic grasses and\r\nother plants, for the production of essential oils. The manufacture\r\nwas tried on a small scale in 1865, and has been so successful that an\r\naggregate of 200 lb. of various essential oils is now produced _daily_.\r\nThese oils are stated to be Citronella, Lemon Grass, Patchouly, Nutmeg,\r\nMace, Pepper, and Oman (p. 302): and mint is now being cultivated.[2709]\r\n\r\nGinger grass oil is distilled in the collectorate of Khandesh in the\r\nBombay Presidency. That produced in the district of Namár in the valley\r\nof the Nerbudda, is sometimes called _Grass Oil of Namar_. We have\r\nno particulars of the distillation, which however must be carried on\r\nextensively.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The Indian grass oils are lighter than water, devoid\r\nof rotatory power when examined by polarized light, and do not alter\r\nlitmus paper. They are all extremely fragrant, having an odour like\r\na mixture of lemon and rose. Lemon grass, which in colour is a deep\r\ngolden brown, has an odour resembling that of the sweet-scented verbena\r\nof the gardens, _Lippia citriodora_ H.B.K. Ginger grass oil, the\r\ncolour of which varies from pale greenish yellow to yellowish-brown,\r\nhas the odour of _Pelargonium Radula_ Aiton. The colour of citronella\r\noil is a light greenish yellow. The manufacture of Winter of Ceylon,\r\nand of Fisher of Singapore, have a reputation for excellence, and are\r\ngenerally indicated by name in drug sale catalogues.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Stenhouse[2710] examined in 1844 oil of ginger\r\ngrass given to him by Christison as _Oil of Namur_ (or _Nimar_). The\r\nsample was of deep yellow, and apparently old, for when mixed with\r\nwater and subjected to distillation, it left nearly one half its bulk\r\nof a fluid resin, the oil which passed over being colourless. After\r\nrectification from chloride of calcium, it was shown to consist of a\r\nhydrocarbon mixed with a small proportion of an oxygenated oil. The\r\nlatter having been decomposed by sodium, and the oil again rectified,\r\na second analysis was made which proved it isomeric with oil of\r\nturpentine.\r\n\r\n[2707] _Ephemerides Naturæ Curiosorum_, cent. v.-vi. (1717), appendix\r\n157.\r\n\r\n[2708] _Pharmacopœia of India_, 1868. 465.\r\n\r\n[2709] _Straits Settlements Blue Book for 1872_, Singapore, 1873. 465.\r\n\r\n[2710] _Mem. of Chem. Soc._ ii. (1845) 122.\r\n\r\nA genuine grass oil from Khandesh, derived as we suppose from the\r\nsame species, which was examined by one of us (F.), yielded nothing\r\ncrystalline when saturated with dry hydrochloric acid; but when the\r\nliquid was afterwards treated with fuming nitric acid, crystals of the\r\ncompound, C₁₀H₁₆, HCl, sublimed into the upper part of the vessel. We\r\nhave observed that the oils both of lemon grass and citronella yield\r\nsolid compounds, if shaken with a saturated solution of bisulphite of\r\nsodium.\r\n\r\nCitronella oil was found by Gladstone (1872) to be composed chiefly of\r\nan oxidized oil, which he called _Citronellol_, and which he separated\r\nby fractional distillation into two portions, the one boiling at\r\n202-205° C., the other 199-202° C. The composition of each portion is\r\nindicated by the formula C₁₀H₁₆O.\r\n\r\nWright’s researches (1874) tend rather to show the prevailing part of\r\ncitronella oil to consist of the liquid C₁₀H₁₈O, boiling near 210°,\r\nwhich he calls _Citronellol_. It unites with bromine, and the resulting\r\ncompound, upon heating, breaks up according to the following equation:—\r\n\r\n    C₁₀H₁₈OBr₂ = OH₂ · 2 HBr · C₁₀H₁₄.\r\n                              Cymene.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The growing trade in grass oil is exemplified in a striking\r\nmanner by the following statistics. The export of _Citronella Oil_ from\r\nCeylon in 1864 was 622,000 ounces, valued at £8230. In the _Ceylon Blue\r\nBook_, the exports for 1872 are returned thus:—\r\n\r\n    To the United Kingdom          1,163,074 ounces}\r\n      British India                    5,713   ”   } 1,595,257\r\n      United States of North America 426,470   ”   }    ounces.[2711]\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the oil shipped from Ceylon to the United Kingdom was valued at\r\n42,871 rupees, that sent to other foreign countries at 45,871 rupees,\r\nto British possessions 660 rupees (one rupee equal to about 2_s._).\r\n\r\n_Oil of Lemon Grass_, which is a more costly article and less\r\nextensively produced, was exported from Ceylon during the same year\r\nto the extent of 13,515 ounces, more than half of which quantity was\r\nshipped to the United States. There are no analogous statistics for\r\nthese two oils from Singapore, where, as stated at p. 726, they are now\r\nlargely manufactured.\r\n\r\nBy the official _Report on the External Commerce of Bombay_, published\r\nin 1867, we find that during the year ending 31 March, 1867, _Grass\r\nOil_ [i.e. _Ginger Grass_ or _Rúsa Oil_] was exported thence to the\r\namount of 41,643 lb. This oil is shipped to England and to the ports of\r\nthe Red Sea.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Grass oils are much esteemed in India as an external application\r\nin rheumatism. Rúsa oil is said to stimulate the growth of the hair.\r\nInternally, grass oil is sometimes administered as a carminative in\r\ncolic; and an infusion of the leaves of lemon grass is prescribed as\r\na diaphoretic and stimulant. In Europe and America the oils are used\r\nalmost exclusively by the soapmakers and perfumers.[2712]\r\n\r\n[2711] In addition to which, there were “_842 dozens and 33 packages_”\r\nof the same oil shipped to the United States. One ounce equal to 31·1\r\ngrammes.\r\n\r\n[2712] The foliage of the large odoriferous species of _Andropogon_ is\r\nused in India for thatching. It is eaten voraciously by cattle, whose\r\nflesh and milk become flavoured with its strong aroma.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable use made of any grass oil is that for\r\nadulterating _Attar of Rose_ in European Turkey. The oil thus employed\r\nis that of _Andropogon Schœnanthus_ L. (see p. 725); and it is a\r\ncurious fact that its Hindustani name is closely similar in sound to\r\nthe word _rose_. Thus under the designation _Rusa_, _Rowsah_, _Rosa_,\r\n_Rosé_, _Roshé_,[2713] it is exported in large quantities from Bombay\r\nto the ports of Arabia, probably chiefly to Jidda, whence it is carried\r\nto Turkey by the Mahommedan pilgrims. In Arabia and Turkey, it appears\r\nunder the name _Idris yàghi_, while in the attar-producing districts\r\nof the Balkan it is known, at least to Europeans, as _Geranium Oil_ or\r\n_Palmarosa Oil_. Before being mixed with attar, the oil is subjected to\r\na certain preparation, which is accomplished by shaking it with water\r\nacidulated with lemon juice, and then exposing it to the sun and air.\r\nBy this process, described by Baur,[2714] the oil loses a penetrating\r\nafter-smell, and acquires a pale straw-colour. The optical and chemical\r\ndifferences between grass oil thus refined and attar of rose are slight\r\nand do not indicate a small admixture of the former. If grass oil is\r\nadded largely to attar, it will prevent its congealing.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The grass oil prepared by the natives of India is not\r\nunfrequently contaminated with fatty oil.\r\n\r\nOther Products of the genus Andropogon.\r\n\r\n=Herba Schœnanthi vel Squinanthi=, _Juncus odoratus_, _Fœnum Camelorum_.\r\n\r\nThe drug bearing these names has had a place in pharmacy from the days\r\nof Dioscorides down to the middle of the last century, and is still\r\nmet with in the East. The plant which affords it, formerly confounded\r\nwith other species, is now known to be _Andropogon laniger_ Desf., a\r\ngrass of wide distribution, growing in hot dry regions in Northern\r\nAfrica (Algeria), Arabia, and North-western India, reaching Thibet,\r\nwhere it is found up to an elevation of 11,000 feet. Mr. Tolbort has\r\nsent us specimens under the name of _Kháví_, gathered by himself in\r\n1869 between Multán and Kot Sultán, and quite agreeing with the drug of\r\npharmacy. The grass has an aromatic pungent taste, which is retained in\r\nvery old specimens. We are not aware that it is distilled for essential\r\noil.\r\n\r\n=Cuscus or Vetti-ver=[2715]—This is the long fibrous root of\r\n_Andropogon muricatus_ Retz, a large grass found abundantly in\r\nrich moist ground in Southern India and Bengal. Inscriptions on\r\ncopper-plates lately discovered in the district of Etawah, south-east\r\nof Agra, and dating from A.D. 1103 and 1174, record grants of villages\r\nto Brahmins by the kings of Kanauj, and enumerate the imposts that were\r\nto be levied. These include taxes on mines, salt pits and the trade\r\nin precious metals, also on mahwah (_Bassia_) and mango trees, and on\r\n_Cuscus Grass_.[2716]\r\n\r\n[2713] 50 cases, containing about 2250 lb., imported from Bombay, were\r\noffered as “_Rose Oil_” at public sale, by a London drug-broker, 31\r\nJuly, 1873.\r\n\r\n[2714] See p. 267.\r\n\r\n[2715] _Cuscus_, otherwise written _Khus-khus_, a name adopted by the\r\nEnglish in India, is probably from the Persian _Khas_. _Vetti-ver_ is\r\nthe Malyalim name of the plant.\r\n\r\n[2716] _Proc. of Asiat. Soc. of Bengal_, Aug. 1873. 161.\r\n\r\nCuscus, which appears occasionally in the London drug sales, is used\r\nin England for laying in drawers as a perfume. In India it serves for\r\nmaking _tatties_ or screens, which are placed in windows and doorways,\r\nand when wetted, diffuse an agreeable odour and coolness. It is also\r\nused for making ornamental baskets and many small articles, and has\r\nsome reputation as a medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHIZOMA GRAMINIS.\r\n\r\n_Radix Graminis_; _Couch Grass_, _Quitch Grass_, _Dog’s Grass_; F.\r\n_Chiendent commun ou Petit Chiendent_; G. _Queckenwurzel_, _Graswurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Agropyrum repens_ P. Beauv. (_Triticum repens_ L.),\r\na widely diffused weed, growing in fields and waste places in all parts\r\nof Europe, in Northern Asia down to the region south of the Caspian,\r\nalso in North America; and in South America to Patagonia and Tierra del\r\nFuego.\r\n\r\n=History=—The ancients were familiar with a grass termed [Greek\r\nAgrôstis] and _Gramen_, having a creeping rootstock like that under\r\nnotice. It is impossible to determine to what species the plant is\r\nreferable, though it is probable that the grass _Cynodon Dactylon_\r\nPers., as well as _Agropyrum repens_, was included under these names.\r\n\r\nDioscorides asserts that its root taken in the form of decoction, is\r\na useful remedy in suppression of urine and vesical calculus. The\r\nsame statements are made by Pliny; and again occur in the writings\r\nof Oribasius[2717] and Marcellus Empiricus[2718] in the 4th, and of\r\nAëtius[2719] in the 6th century, and are repeated in the mediæval\r\nherbals,[2720] where also figures of the plant may be found, as\r\nfor instance in Dodonæus. The drug is also met with in the German\r\npharmaceutical tariffs of the 16th century. Turner[2721] and Gerarde\r\nboth ascribe to a decoction of grass root diuretic and lithontriptic\r\nvirtues. The drug is still a domestic remedy in great repute in France,\r\nbeing taken as a demulcent and sudorific in the form of _tisane_.\r\n\r\n[2717] _De virtute simplicium_, cap. i. (Agrostis).\r\n\r\n[2718] _De medicamentis_, cap. xxvi.\r\n\r\n[2719] Tetrabibli primæ, sermo i.\r\n\r\n[2720] As in the _Herbarius Pataviæ_ printed in 1485, in which it is\r\nsaid of _Gramen_—“aqua decoctionis ejus ... valet contra dissuriam ...\r\net frangit lapidem et curat vulnera vesicæ et provocat urinam....”\r\n\r\n[2721] _Herball_, part 2, 1568. 13.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Couch-grass has a long, stiff, pale yellow, smooth\r\nrhizome, ⅒ of an inch in diameter, creeping close under the surface of\r\nthe ground, occasionally branching, marked at intervals of about an\r\ninch by nodes, which bear slender branching roots and the remains of\r\nsheathing rudimentary leaves.\r\n\r\nAs found in the shops, the rhizome is always free from rootlets, cut\r\ninto short lengths of ⅛ to ¼ of an inch, and dried. It is thus in the\r\nform of little, shining, straw-coloured, many-edged, tubular pieces,\r\nwhich are without odour, but have a slightly sweet taste.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—A transverse section of this rhizome shows\r\ntwo different portions of tissue, separated by the so-called\r\nnucleus-sheath. The latter consists of an unbroken ring of prismatic\r\ncells, analogous to those occurring in sarsaparilla. In _Rhizoma\r\nGraminis_, the outer part of the tissue exhibits a diffuse circle of\r\nabout 20 liber bundles, and the interior part about the same number\r\nof fibro-vascular bundles more densely packed. The pith is reduced to\r\na few rows of cells, the rhizome being always hollow, except at the\r\nnodes. No solid contents are to be met with in the tissue.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Composition_—The constituents of couch-grass include no\r\nsubstance to which medicinal powers can be ascribed. The juice of the\r\nrhizome afforded to H. Müller[2722] about 3 per cent. of sugar, and\r\n7 to 8 per cent. of _Triticin_, C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁, a tasteless, amorphous,\r\ngummy substance, easily transformed into sugar if its concentrated\r\nsolution is kept for a short time at 110°C. When treated with nitric\r\nacid, it yields oxalic acid. The rhizome affords also another gummy\r\nmatter containing nitrogen, and quickly undergoing decomposition; the\r\ndrug moreover is somewhat rich in acid malates. Mannite is probably\r\noccasionally present as in taraxacum (p. 394), for such is the\r\ninference we draw from the opposite results obtained by Stenhouse and\r\nby Völcker. Starch, pectin and resin are wanting. The rhizome leaves 4½\r\nper cent. of ash.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—A decoction of the rhizome has of late been recommended in\r\nmucous discharge from the bladder.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—_Agropyrum acutum_ R. et S., _A. pungens_ R. et S., and\r\n_A. junceum_ P. Beauv., by some botanists regarded as mere maritime\r\nvarieties of _A. repens_, have rootstocks perfectly similar to this\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n_Cynodon Dactylon_ Pers., a grass very common in the South of Europe\r\nand the warmer parts of Western Europe, also indigenous to Northern\r\nAfrica as far as Sennaar and Abyssinia, affords the _Gros Chiendent_ or\r\n_Chiendent pied-de-poule_ of the French. It is a rhizome differing from\r\nthat of couch-grass in being a little stouter. Under the microscope it\r\ndisplays an entirely different structure, inasmuch as it contains a\r\nlarge number of much stronger fibro-vascular bundles, and a cellular\r\ntissue loaded with starch, and is therefore in appearance much more\r\nwoody. It thus approximates to the rhizome of _Carex arenaria_ L.,\r\nwhich is as much used in Germany as that of _Cynodon_ in Southern\r\nEurope. The latter appears to contain _Asparagin_ (the _Cynodin_ of\r\nSemmola[2723]), or a substance similar to it.\r\n\r\n[2722] _Archiv der Pharm._ 203.

It is found on hilly pastures and\r\nheaths throughout Central and Northern Europe from the Alps and\r\nPyrenees to the Arctic reunions, in the mountains of the east and\r\ncentre of Spain, throughout Russian Asia to Amurland and Japan, in\r\nNorth and South America, the Falkland Isles, Australia and the Cape of\r\nGood Hope. It occurs throughout Great Britain, but is most plentiful on\r\nthe moors of the northern counties.\r\n\r\nThe part of the plant employed in pharmacy is the minute spores, which,\r\nas a yellow powder, are shaken out of the kidney-shaped capsules\r\nor sporangia, growing on the inner side of the bracts covering the\r\nfruit-spike.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which those sporæ are able to reproduce the mother plant\r\nis not yet satisfactorily ascertained.[2724]\r\n\r\n=History=—The Common Clubmoss was well known as _Muscus terrestris_\r\nor _Muscus clavatus_, to the older botanists, as Tragus, Dodonæus,\r\nTabernæmontanus, Bauhin, Parkinson and Ray, by most of whom its\r\nsupposed virtues as a herb have been commemorated. Though the powder\r\n(spores) was officinal in Germany, and used as an application to wounds\r\nin the middle of the 17th century,[2725] it does not appear to have\r\nbeen known in the English shops until a comparatively recent period.\r\nIt is not included by Dale[2726] in the list of drugs sold by London\r\ndruggists in 1692, nor enumerated in English drug lists of the last\r\ncentury; and it never had a place in the London Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n[2724] The few particulars may be found in the excellent description of\r\nLycopodium in Luerssen’s “_Medicinisch-pharmaceutische Botanik_,” i.\r\n(Leipzig, 1878) 635, with figures.\r\n\r\n[2725] Schröder, _Pharmacopœia Medico-chymica_, ed. 4, Lugd. 1656.\r\n538.—Flückiger, “_Documente_” (quoted p. 404) 63. 68.\r\n\r\n[2726] _Pharmacologia_, Lond. 1693.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Lycopodium is a fine, mobile, inodorous, tasteless powder\r\nof pale yellow hue, having at 16° C. a sp. gr. of 1·062. It floats on\r\nwater and is wetted with difficulty, yet sinks in that fluid after\r\nboiling. By strong titration it coheres, assumes a grey tint, and\r\nleaves an oily stain on paper; it may then be mixed with water. It is\r\nimmediately moistened by oily and alcoholic liquids, chloroform, or\r\nether. It loses only 4 per cent. of moisture when dried at 100° C. When\r\nslowly heated, it burns away quietly, but when projected into flame, it\r\nignites instantly and explosively, burning with much light, an effect\r\nexhibited by some other pulverulent bodies having a peculiar structure,\r\nas fern spores and kamala.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—Under the microscope lycopodium is seen to\r\nbe composed of uniform cells or granules, 25 mkm. in diameter, each\r\nbounded by four faces, one of which (the base) is convex, while the\r\nothers terminate in a triangular pyramid, the three furrowed edges of\r\nwhich do not reach quite to the base. These tetrahedral granules are\r\nmarked by minute ridges, forming by their intersections, regular five-\r\nor six-sided meshes. At the points of intersection, small elevations\r\nare produced, which, under a low magnifying power, give the granules a\r\nspeckled appearance. Below this network lies a yellow, coherent, thin,\r\nbut compact membrane, which exhibits considerable power of resistance,\r\nnot being ruptured either by boiling water or by potash lye. Oil of\r\nvitriol does not act upon it in the cold, even after several days;\r\nbut it instantly penetrates the grains and renders them transparent,\r\nwhile at the same time numerous drops of oil make their appearance and\r\nquickly exude.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—One of the most remarkable constituents of\r\nlycopodium spores is a fixed oil, which they contain to the astonishing\r\namount of 47 per cent. Bucholz pointed out its existence in 1807, but\r\nobtained it only to the extent of 6 per cent. Yet if the spores are\r\nthoroughly comminuted by prolonged trituration with sand, and are then\r\nexhausted with chloroform or ether, we find that the larger proportion\r\nabove mentioned can be obtained. The oil is a bland liquid, which does\r\nnot solidify even at -15° C.\r\n\r\nBy subjecting lycopodium or its extract to distillation with or without\r\nan alkali, Stenhouse obtained volatile bases, the presence of which\r\nwe can fully confirm; but they occur in exceedingly small proportion.\r\nThe ash of lycopodium amounts to 4 per cent.; it is not alkaline; it\r\ncontains alumina, and one per cent. of phosphoric acid, constituents\r\nlikewise found in the green parts of the plant.\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—To obtain lycopodium, the tops of the plant\r\nare cut as the spikes approach maturity, taken home, and the powder\r\nshaken out and separated by a sieve. It is collected chiefly in July\r\nand August, in Russia, Germany and Switzerland. The quantity obtained\r\nvaries greatly by reason of frequent failures in the growth of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nFrance imported in 1870, 7262 kilo. (16,017 lb.) of lycopodium, chiefly\r\nfrom Germany. The consumption in England is probably very much smaller,\r\nbut there are no data to consult.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Lycopodium is not now regarded as possessing any medicinal\r\nvirtues, and is only used externally for dusting excoriated surfaces\r\nand for placing in pill boxes to prevent the mutual adhesion of pills.\r\nIt is also employed by the pyrotechnist.\r\n\r\n=Adulteration=—The spores are so peculiar in structure, that they\r\ncan be distinguished with certainty by the microscope from all other\r\nsubstances. It is only the species of clubmoss that are nearly related\r\nto _L. clavatum_,[2727] that yield an analogous product, and this may\r\nbe used with equal advantage.\r\n\r\nThe pollen of phænogamous plants, as of _Pinus silvestris_, looks\r\nat first sight much like lycopodium, but its structure is totally\r\ndifferent and very easily recognized by the microscope.\r\n\r\nWater, even on boiling, is unable to dissolve anything from lycopodium;\r\nslight traces of sulphate of calcium are not seldom met with in the\r\nfiltrate. Yet an undue proportion of gypsum will be detected by the\r\nfollowing methods:—\r\n\r\nStarch and dextrin, which are sometimes fraudulently mixed with the\r\nspores, are easily recognized by the well-known tests. Inorganic\r\nadmixtures, as gypsum or magnesia, may be detected by their sinking in\r\nbisulphide of carbon, whereas lycopodium rises to the surface; or by\r\nincineration, a good commercial drug leaving about 4 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFILICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHIZOMA FILICIS.\r\n\r\n_Radix Filicis maris_; _Male Fern Rhizome_, _Male Fern Root_; F.\r\n_Racine de Fougère mâle_; G. _Farnwurzel_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Aspidium Filix mas_ Swartz (_Polypodium_ L.\r\n_Nephrodium_ Michaux). The male fern is one of the most widely\r\ndistributed species, usually growing in abundance and, in temperate\r\nregions, ascending as high as the arborescent vegetation. It occurs all\r\nover Europe from Sicily to Iceland, in Greenland, throughout Central\r\nand Russian Asia to the Himalaya and Japan; is found throughout China,\r\nand again in Java and the Sandwich Islands, as well as in Africa from\r\nAlgeria to the Cape Colony and Mauritius. In North America it is\r\nwanting in the Eastern United States, being principally replaced by\r\nthe nearly allied _Aspidium marginale_ Sw. and _A. Goldieanum_ Hook.;\r\nbut it is met with in Canada, California and Mexico, as well as in New\r\nGranada, Venezuela, Brazil, and Peru.\r\n\r\n=History=—The use of the rhizome of ferns as a vermifuge was well\r\nknown to the ancients,[2728] as Theophrastus, Dioscorides and Pliny\r\nall giving curious descriptions of the plant. The remedy would appear\r\nto have been administered also during the middle ages, for it was\r\nagain noticed by Valerius Cordus,[2729] and had a place in German\r\npharmaceutical tariffs of the sixteenth century as well as in\r\nSchröder’s Dispensatory.[2730] Yet Tragus[2731] remarks that, at least\r\nin Germany, the root was little used. It was in fact subsequently\r\nnearly forgotten until revived by the introduction of certain secret\r\nremedies for tapeworm, of which powdered male fern rhizome, combined\r\nwith drastic purgatives, was a chief constituent.\r\n\r\n[2727] Especially _L. annotinum_, _L. complanatum_ and _L. inundatum_.\r\n\r\n[2728] Murray, _Apparatus medicaminum_, v.

His treatment for the parasite was so successful that it\r\nattracted the notice of Frederick the Great, who purchased his nostrum\r\nfor an annuity of 200 _thalers_ (£30), besides conferring upon him the\r\ndignity of Aulic Councillor.[2732]\r\n\r\nGreat celebrity was also gained for the method of treating tapeworm\r\npractised by Madame Nuffler or Nuffer, the widow of a surgeon at Murten\r\n(Morat), likewise in Switzerland, who in 1775 obtained for the secret\r\nfrom Louis XIV., after an inquiry by _savans_ of the period, the sum of\r\n18,000 livres. Her method of treatment consisted in the administration\r\nof—1. Panada made of bread with a little butter. 2. A clyster of salt\r\nwater and olive oil. 3. The “_spécifique_”—simply _powdered fern root_.\r\n4. A purgative bolus of calomel, gamboge, acammony, and _Confectio\r\nhyacinthidis_,—given in the foregoing order.[2733]\r\n\r\nJ. Peschier,[2734] a pharmacien of Geneva, recommended as a substitute\r\nfor the bulky powder of the root, an ethereal extract, an efficient\r\npreparation, which though proposed in 1825, was scarcely used in\r\nEngland until about 1851; at present it is the only form in which male\r\nfern is employed. Peschier already observed a crystallized deposit in\r\nhis extract.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The fresh rhizome or caudex is short and massive, 2-3\r\ninches in diameter, decumbent, or rising a few inches above the ground,\r\nand bearing on its summit a circular tuft of fronds, which in their\r\nlower part are thickly beset with brown chaffy scales. Below the\r\ngrowing fronds are the remains of those of previous seasons, which\r\nretain in their firm, fleshy bases, vitality and succulence for years\r\nafter their upper portion has perished. From among these fleshy bases,\r\nspring the black, wiry, branching roots.[2735] The rhizome is rather\r\nfleshy, and easily cut with a knife, internally of a bright pale\r\nyellowish green; it has very little odour and a sweetish astringent\r\ntaste. For pharmaceutical use, it should be collected in the late\r\nautumn, winter or early spring, divested of the dead portions, split\r\nopen, dried with a gentle heat, reduced to coarse powder, and at once\r\nexhausted with ether. Extract obtained in this way is more efficient\r\nthan that which has been got from rhizome that has been kept some time.\r\n\r\n[2732] Cornaz, _Les familles médicales de la ville de Neuchâtel_, 1864.\r\n20.\r\n\r\n[2733] _Traitement contre le Ténia ou ver solitaire, pratiqué à Morat\r\nen Suisse, examiné et éprouvé à Paris._ Publié par ordre du Roi, 1775.\r\n4°, pp. 30. 3 plates, one representing the plant, its rhizome and\r\nleaves.—Also English translation by Dr. Simmons, London, 1778. 8°.\r\n\r\n[2734] _Bibliothèque Universelle_, xxx.

(1878) 504. 561.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—On transverse section of the rootstock, the\r\ntissue shows rounded, somewhat polyhedral cells with porous walls;\r\nthe outer cells are brown and rather smaller, but do not exhibit the\r\nregular flattened shape, usual in many suberous coats. Within this\r\ncortical layer, there is a circle of about 10 large vascular bundles,\r\nbesides a large number of smaller ones scattered beyond the circle.\r\nThe leaf-bases exhibit a somewhat different structure, their vascular\r\nbundles, usually 8, forming but one diffuse circle.\r\n\r\nThe cells of the parenchyme contain starch, greenish or brownish\r\ngranules of tannic matter, and drops of oil. In the green, vigorously\r\nvegetating parts of the rootstock there are numerous smaller and larger\r\nintercellular spaces, into which a few stalked glands project, as shown\r\nby Prof. Schacht of Bonn in 1863. These globular glands originate from\r\nthe cells bordering the intercellular spaces. After their complete\r\ndevelopment, and the appearance of starch in the adjacent parenchyme,\r\nthey exude a greenish fluid, which when thin slices of the rhizome are\r\nkept some time in glycerin, solidifies in acicular crystals.[2736]\r\nSuch glands appear to be wanting in most of the allied ferns, such as\r\n_Aspidium Oreopteris_ Sw. and _Asplenium Filix fœmina_ Bernh. They\r\nhave been observed by one of us (F.), in the small rhizome of _A.\r\nspinulosum_ Sw. Similar glands, but not exuding a green liquid, occur\r\nbetween the paleæ below the vegetating cone of the rootstock.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Of the numerous examinations which have been\r\nmade of this drug, those of Bock (1852), of Luck (1860), and of\r\nKruse (1876), may be especially mentioned. Besides the universally\r\ndistributed constituents of plants, there have been found in the\r\nrhizome 5 to 6 per cent. of a green fatty oil, traces of volatile\r\noil, resin, tannin (Luck’s _Tannaspidic_ and _Pteritannic Acids_) and\r\ncrystallizable sugar, which according to Bock is probably cane sugar.\r\n\r\nThe medicinal ethereal extract, of which the rhizome yields about 8 per\r\ncent., deposits a colourless, granular, crystalline substance, noticed\r\nby Peschier as early as 1826, and subsequently designated by Luck,\r\n_Filicic Acid_. Grabowski (1867) assigned it the formula C₁₄H₁₈O₅. We\r\nlearn from Prof. Buchheim that he regards filicic acid as the source\r\nof the medicinal efficacy of the drug. By fusion with potash, filicic\r\nacid is converted into phloroglucin and butyric acid. The green\r\nliquid portion of the extract consists mainly of a glyceride called\r\n_Filixolin_, from which Luck obtained by saponification two acids,\r\nthe one volatile, _Filosmylic Acid_, the other non-volatile, termed\r\n_Filixolic Acid_.\r\n\r\nMalin (1867) showed that the tannic acid of male fern may be decomposed\r\nby boiling dilute acids into sugar and a red substance, _Filix-red_,\r\nC₂₆H₁₈O₁₂, analogous to Cinchona-red.\r\n\r\nSchoonbroodt[2737] performed some interesting experiments with _fresh_\r\nfern root, showing that it contains _volatile acids_ of the fatty\r\nseries, among which is probably _formic_; but also a fixed acid,\r\naccompanied by an oil of disagreeable odour. The liquid distilled from\r\nthe dried root did not evolve a similar odour, nor did it contain any\r\nacid body. A small quantity of essential oil was obtained by means of\r\nether from the alcoholic extract of the fresh but not of the dried\r\nrootstock. The rhizome of male fern yields 2 to 3 per cent. of ash,\r\nconsisting mainly of phosphates, carbonates, and sulphates of calcium\r\nand potassium, together with silica.\r\n\r\n[2736] The chemical nature of this body remains to be ascertained. The\r\ncrystals are probably _Filicic Acid_, accompanied by chlorophyl and\r\nessential oil.\r\n\r\n[2737] _Journal de Médecine de Bruxelles_, 1867 and 1868—also in the\r\n_Jahresbericht_ of Wiggers and Husemann, 1869. 21.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The ethereal extract has been prescribed for all kinds of\r\nintestinal worms; but recent experience goes to prove that its\r\neffects are chiefly exhibited in cases of tapeworm. It is equally and\r\nthoroughly efficacious in the three kinds respectively termed _Tænia\r\nsolium_, _T. medio-cannellata_ and _Bothriocephalus latus_.\r\n\r\n=Substitution=—The rhizomes of _Asplenium Filix fœmina_ Bernh.,\r\n_Aspidium montanum_ Vogl. (_A. Oreopteris_ Sw.) and _A. spinulosum_\r\nSw. may scarcely be mistaken for that of _A. Filix mas_. The best\r\nmeans of distinguishing them is afforded by transverse sections of the\r\nleaf-bases. In _Filix mas_, the section exhibits 8 vascular bundles,—in\r\nthe other ferns named, only 2,—a difference easily ascertained by\r\nexamination under a lens. Practically, no other indigenous fern than\r\n_A. Filix mas_ affords a rhizome of sufficient bulk so as to be\r\nremunerative. We are not acquainted with that of the American _Aspidium\r\nmarginale_ Swartz, the section of which shows 6 vascular bundles; its\r\nextract is stated by Cressler (1878) to be perfectly active.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=_Thallogens._=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLICHENES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICHEN ISLANDICUS.\r\n\r\n_Iceland Moss_; F. _Lichen ou Mousse d’Islande_; G. _Isländisches Moos_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Cetraria islandica_ Acharius.[2738]—It is abundant\r\nin high northern latitudes, as Greenland, Spitzbergen, Siberia,\r\nScandinavia and Iceland, where it grows even in the plains. It is\r\nfound in the mountainous parts of Great Britain, France, Italy, and\r\nSpain, in Switzerland (in elevations of nearly 10,000 feet), and in the\r\nSouthern Danubian countries. It also occurs in North America and in the\r\nAntarctic regions.\r\n\r\n=History=—In the North of Europe, this lichen has long been used\r\nunder the general name of _Mosi_, _Mossa_ or _Mus_,[2739] as an\r\narticle of food. It is the _Muscus crispæ Lactucæ similis_ of\r\nValerius Cordus,[2740] and was also mentioned by Ole Borrich, of\r\nCopenhagen (1671), who called it _Muscus catharticus_, under the\r\nnotion that in early spring it possesses purgative properties.[2741]\r\nThe pharmaceutical tariff of the same city, of the year 1672,\r\nlikewise quotes _Muscus catharticus islandicus_.[2742] Its medicinal\r\nemployment in pulmonary disorders was favourably spoken of by Hjärne in\r\n1683,[2743] but it is only since 1757 that it has come into general use\r\nas a medicine, chiefly on the recommendation of Linnæus and Scopoli.\r\n\r\n=Description=[2744]—The plant consists of an erect, foliaceous,\r\nbranching thallus, about 4 inches high, curled, channelled or rolled\r\ninto tubes, terminating in spreading truncate, flattened lobes, the\r\nedges of which are fringed with short thick prominences. The thallus is\r\nsmooth, grey, or of a light olive-brown; the under surface is paler and\r\nirregularly beset with depressed white spots. The apothecia (fruits),\r\nwhich are not very common, appear at the apices of the thallus, as\r\nrounded boss-like bodies, ²/₁₀ to ³/₁₀ of an inch across, of a dark,\r\nrusty colour. The colour and mode of division of the thallus vary\r\ngreatly, so that many varieties of the plant have been distinguished.\r\n\r\n[2738] _Cetraria_ from _cetra_, an ancient shield of hide, in allusion\r\nto the circular apothecia.\r\n\r\n[2739] These names are generally applied in Scandinavia and Iceland to\r\nthe smaller cryptogams, as lichens, true mosses, lycopodium, etc.\r\n\r\n[2740] Hist. stirpium, quoted in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[2741] Bergius, _Materia Medica_, Stockholm, ii.

(1790) 510.\r\n\r\n[2744] For an exhaustive account and figures see Luerssen (quoted at p.\r\n734) p. 176.\r\n\r\nIn the dry state, Iceland moss is light, harsh and springy; it absorbs\r\nwater in which it is placed to the extent of a third of its weight,\r\nbecoming soft and cartilaginous; it ordinarily contains about 10 per\r\ncent. of hygroscopic water. It is inodorous, but when wetted has a\r\nslight seaweed-like smell; its taste is slightly bitter.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—A transverse section exhibits, when strongly\r\nmagnified, a broad loose central layer of long, thick-walled branching\r\nwalls of _hyphæ_, containing air, and enclosing wide hollow spaces.\r\nThis middle layer encloses a certain number of larger cells called\r\n_gonidia_, coloured with chlorophyll. The gonidia are not destroyed\r\neither by strong sulphuric acid, or by boiling them with potash. They\r\nassume however a deep violet colour when treated with caustic potash\r\nand then left for 24 hours in a solution of iodine in potassium iodide.\r\n\r\nThe tissues on either side of this central layer consists of very\r\nthickly felted hyphæ, without intervening spaces, and does not appear\r\nto contain any particular substance. This compact and tenacious tissue\r\npasses into a thin cortical layer consisting of cells very closely\r\nbound together. Under the influence of reagents this layer becomes very\r\nevident: thus when moistened with strong sulphuric or hydrochloric\r\nacid, it separates from the rest of the tissue as a coherent membrane,\r\nand rolls itself backward. On boiling with water the inner tissue\r\nswells up, the cell-walls being partly dissolved. Thin slices of\r\nthe lichen are coloured reddish or pale blue by iodine water,—more\r\ndistinctly blue, if previously treated with sulphuric acid. The colour\r\nspreads uniformly over the inner tissue, but no starch granules can\r\nbe detected; the cortical layer is merely coloured brown by iodine.\r\nThe white spots on the outer surface of the thallus are resolved by\r\npressure under a plate of glass into minute round transparent granules,\r\nnot coloured by iodine, and thick branched cells like those of the\r\ncentral layer.\r\n\r\nThe short thick prominences on the edge of the thallus, frequently\r\nterminate in one or more sac-like cavities (_spermogonia_) containing\r\na large number of simple bar-shaped cells (_spermatia_), only 6 mkm.\r\nlong; they are enveloped in transparent mucus, and may be expelled\r\nby pressure under glass. It has been shown by Stahl (1874) that\r\nthey represent the fertilizing corpuscles or seaweeds of the class\r\n_Florideæ_.\r\n\r\nThe observations of De Bary (1866) and Schwendener (1867-70) confirmed\r\nand much extended by the researches of Bornet[2745] (1873-74), have\r\nshown that the gonidia of lichens are referable to some species of\r\n_Alga_, and are capable of an independent existence; that the relations\r\nof the hyphæ to the gonidia are of such a nature as to exclude the\r\npossibility of either of those bodies being produced by the other;\r\nand further that the theory of parasitism is the only one capable\r\nof explaining these relations in a satisfactory manner. Under this\r\nsingular theory, lichens are compound organisms, formed of an alga, and\r\nof a fungus living upon it as a parasite.\r\n\r\n[2745] _Recherches sur les gonidies des Lichens._—_Ann. des Sciences\r\nnat._ Bot. xvii. (1873) 45-110; 11 plates; also xix. (1874)\r\n314-320.—For a complete abstract of these and all the more recent\r\ninvestigations on this subject, see Luerssen (_l.c._) 186 _et seq._\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—Boiling water extracts from Iceland moss as\r\nmuch as 70 per cent. of the so-called _Lichenin_, or _Lichen-starch_,\r\na body which is perfectly devoid of structure. The decoction (1:\r\n20) gelatinizes on cooling, and assumes a reddish or bluish tint by\r\nsolution of iodine. This property of lichenin is plainly seen, when\r\nthe drug is first exhausted by boiling spirit of wine containing some\r\ncarbonate of potassium; and then boiled with 50 to 100 parts of water,\r\nand the decoction precipitated by means of alcohol. The lichenin thus\r\nobtained in a purer state, must be deprived of alcohol by cautiously\r\nwashing it with water. Powdered iodine will now immediately impart to\r\nit while still moist an _intense blue_. Its composition, C₁₂H₂₀O₁₀,\r\nagrees with that of starch and cellulose; and it must be regarded as\r\na modification of the latter, being likewise soluble in water and in\r\nammoniacal solution of copper. Lichenin is not a kind of mucilage,\r\nbecause it yields but insignificant traces of mucic acid, if treated\r\nwith concentrated nitric acid; and also because it contains no\r\ninorganic constituents.[2746] The very trifling proportion of mucic\r\nacid it furnishes may depend upon the presence, in small amount, of an\r\nindependent mucilaginous body.\r\n\r\nAccording to Th. Berg (1873), lichenin consists of what he continues\r\nto call so, and another constituent, the latter only being coloured\r\nby iodine, possessing (dextrogyre) rotatory power, and also being\r\ninsoluble in ammoniacal solution of copper. Berg’s lichenin is not\r\nsoluble in cold water, but readily dissolves in hot water, and again\r\nseparates on cooling. The other constituent on the contrary is\r\nabundantly soluble in cold, and very sparingly in hot water. The drug\r\nyielded to Berg 20 per cent. of “true” lichenin and 10 per cent. of the\r\nother substance.\r\n\r\nThe chlorophyll of the gonidia is not soluble in hydrochloric acid, and\r\nhence is distinguished by Knop and Schnedermann as _Thallochlor_; its\r\nquantity is extremely small.\r\n\r\nThe bitter principle of Cetraria, called _Cetraric Acid_ or _Cetrarin_,\r\nC₁₈H₁₆O₈, crystallizes in microscopic needles, is nearly insoluble in\r\ncold water, and forms with alkalis, yellow, easily soluble, bitter\r\nsalts. The lichen also contains a little sugar, and about 1 per cent.\r\nof a peculiar body, _Licheno-stearic Acid_, C₁₄H₃₄O₃, the crystals of\r\nwhich melt at 120° C. The _Lichenic Acid_ found by Pfaff in 1826 in\r\nIceland moss, and formerly regarded as a peculiar compound, has been\r\nproved identical with fumaric acid.\r\n\r\nIn common with many lichens, cetraria contains _Oxalic Acid_ and is\r\nsaid to yield also some tartaric acid. The ash, which amounts to\r\n1-2 per cent., consists to the extent of two-fifths of silicic acid\r\ncombined chiefly with potash and lime.\r\n\r\n=Collection and Commerce=—Iceland moss is collected in many districts\r\nwhere the plant abounds at least for local use, as in Sweden, whence\r\nsome is shipped to other countries. It is also gathered in Switzerland,\r\nespecially on the mountains of the Canton of Lucerne, and in\r\nSpain.[2747] None is exported from Iceland.\r\n\r\n[2746] The various mucilages and gums yield from 4 to 20 per cent. of\r\nash, but lichenin yields _none_.\r\n\r\n[2747] _Cat. of Spanish Productions_,—London Exhibition, 1851.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—It is given in decoction as a mild tonic, combined with more\r\nactive medicines. It is very little employed in Iceland, and only\r\nin seasons of scarcity, when it is sometimes ground and mixed with\r\nthe flour used in making the _grout_ or grain soup. Occasionally it\r\nis taken boiled in milk. It is not given, as has been asserted, to\r\ndomestic animals.\r\n\r\nAn interesting application of Iceland moss has recently been tried in\r\nSweden. Sten-Stenberg treats it with sulphuric or hydrochloric acid,\r\nwhen 72 per cent. of grape sugar are formed, which may be converted\r\ninto alcohol.[2748]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNGI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECALE CORNUTUM.\r\n\r\n_Ergota_; _Ergot of Rye_,[2749] _Spurred Rye_; F. _Seigle ergoté_; G.\r\n_Mutterkorn_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Claviceps purpurea_ Tulasne, a fungus of the order\r\n_Pyrenomycetes_, of which ergot is an immature form, it being the\r\n_sclerotium_ (termed in the British Pharmacopœia _compact mycelium_ or\r\n_spawn_) developed within the paleæ of numerous plants of the order\r\n_Gramineæ_.\r\n\r\nErgot is obtained almost exclusively from rye, _Secale cereale_ L.;\r\nbut the same fungus is produced on grasses belonging to many other\r\ngenera, as _Agropyrum_, _Alopecurus_, _Ammophila_, _Anthoxanthum_,\r\n_Arrhenatherum_, _Avena_, _Brachypodium_, _Calamagrostis_, _Dactylis_,\r\n_Glyceria_, _Hordeum_, _Lolium_, _Poa_, and _Triticum_. Other organisms\r\nof diverse form, but of doubtful specific distinctness, are developed\r\nin _Molinia_, _Oryza_, _Phragmites_, and other grasses. In the order\r\n_Cyperaceæ_ (e.g., _Scirpus_), peculiar ergots are known.\r\n\r\n=History=—Although it is hardly possible that so singular a production\r\nas ergot should be unnoticed in the writings of the classical authors,\r\nwe believe no undoubted reference to it has been discovered.[2750]\r\nThe earliest date under which we find ergot mentioned on account of\r\nits obstetric virtues is towards the middle of the 16th century, by\r\nAdam Lonicer of Frankfort, who describes its appearance in the ears\r\nof rye, and adds that it is regarded by women to be of remarkable\r\nand certain efficacy.[2751] It is also very clearly described in the\r\nwritings of Johannes Thalius, who speaks of it as used “_ad sistendum\r\nsanguinem_.”[2752] In the next century it was noticed by Caspar Bauhin,\r\nwho termed it _Secale luxurians_,[2753] and by the English botanist\r\nRay,[2754] with allusion to its medicinal properties.\r\n\r\nRathlaw, a Dutch accoucheur, employed ergot in 1747. Thirty years later\r\nDesgranges of Lyons prescribed it with success; but its peculiar and\r\nimportant properties were hardly allowed until the commencement of the\r\npresent century, when Dr. Stearns of New York succeeded in gaining for\r\nthem fuller recognition.[2755] Ergot of rye was not, however, admitted\r\ninto the London Pharmacopœia until 1836.[2756]\r\n\r\n[2748] Dingler’s _Polytechnisches Journal_, 197 (1870) 177; also\r\n_Chemisches Centralblatt_, 1870. 607.\r\n\r\n[2749] From the French _ergot_, anciently _argot_, a cock’s spur.\r\n\r\n[2750] Consult Pliny’s _Nat.

(1868) 609.\r\n\r\n[2756] From 1825 to 1828 the wholesale price of ergot of rye in London\r\nwas from 36_s._ to 50_s._ per lb., that is to say, from twelve to\r\nfifteen times its present value.\r\n\r\nThe use of flour containing a considerable proportion of ergot, gives\r\nrise to a very formidable disease, distinguished in modern medicine as\r\n_Ergotism_, but known in early times by a variety of names, as _Morbus\r\nspasmodicus_, _convulsivus_, _malignus_, _epidemicus vel cerealis_,\r\n_Raphania_, _Convulsio raphania_[2757] or _Ignis sancti Antonii_.\r\n\r\nSome of the malignant epidemics which visited Europe after seasons of\r\nrain and scarcity during the middle ages have been referred with more\r\nor less of probability to ergot-disease.[2758] The chronicles of the\r\n6th and 8th centuries note the occurrence of maladies which may be\r\nsuspected as due to ergotized grain. There is less of doubt regarding\r\nthe epidemics that prevailed from the 10th century and were frequent\r\nin France, and in the 12th in Spain. In the year 1596 Hessen (Hessia)\r\nand the adjoining regions were ravaged by a frightful pestilence, which\r\nthe Medical Faculty of Marburg attributed to the presence of ergot in\r\nthe cereals consumed by the population. The same disease appeared in\r\nFrance in 1630, in Voigtland (Saxony) in the years 1648, 1649, and\r\n1675; again in various parts of France, as Aquitaine and Sologne, in\r\n1650, 1670, and 1674. Freiburg and the neighbouring region were visited\r\nby the same malady in 1702; other parts of Switzerland in 1715-16;\r\nSaxony and Lusatia in 1716; many other districts of Germany in 1717,\r\n1722, 1736, and 1741-2.[2759] The last epidemic in Europe occasioned by\r\nergot appears to be that which, after the rainy season of 1816, visited\r\nLorraine and Burgundy, and proved fatal to many people of the poorer\r\nclass. Ergot disease is sometimes observed in Abyssinia at the present\r\nday,[2760] and a few cases of it have even been lately recorded in\r\nBavaria.[2761]\r\n\r\n=Formation=—The true nature of ergot has long been the source of a\r\ngreat diversity of opinion, not set at rest by the admirable researches\r\nof L.

(1876) 418-434 with\r\nfigures; and especially in Luerssen (quoted at p. 735) 156, _et seqq._\r\n\r\nThe formation of ergot often affects only a few caryopsides in a single\r\near; sometimes, however, more than twenty. In the former case, the\r\nhealthy development of the other caryopsides is not prevented, but if\r\ntoo many are attacked, the entire ear decays. The more isolated ergots\r\ngenerally grow larger, and attain their greatest size on rye which\r\nsprings up here and there among other cereals.\r\n\r\nThe first symptoms of ergot-formation is the so-called _honey-dew of\r\nrye_, a yellowish mucus, having an intensely sweet taste, and the\r\npeculiar disagreeable odour frequently belonging to fungi. Drops\r\nof this mucus show themselves here and there on the ears in the\r\nneighbourhood of diseased grains, and attract ants and beetles of\r\nvarious kinds, especially the yellowish-red _Rhagonycha melanura_\r\nFabr., but not bees. On this account the beetle in question has been\r\nsupposed to be instrumental in the development of ergot, and it may\r\npossibly be so, but only by transporting the saccharine mucus from one\r\nplant to another.\r\n\r\nThe honey-dew of rye contains neither oil-drops nor starch. After\r\ndilution with water, it produces a rapid and abundant separation of\r\ncuprous oxide from an alkaline solution of cupric tartrate. Dried over\r\nsulphuric acid, it solidifies into a crystalline mass. After a few days\r\nthe drops of honey-dew dry up and disappear from the ear. The grain at\r\nthis period becomes completely disintegrated, and devoid of starch.\r\n\r\nThe ergotized soft ovaries are covered with, and penetrated by a white,\r\nspongy, felted tissue, the _mycelium_ of the young fungus. It is made\r\nup of slender, thread-like cells, the _hyphæ_, the outer layer of\r\nwhich consists of radially-diverging cells, the _basidia_. The whole\r\nmycelium forms by its crevices and folds a number of cavities opening\r\nexternally; from its outer layer, which is also called the _hymenium_\r\nor _spermatophorum_, an immense number of agglutinated, elongated\r\ngranules, the _conidia_, are separated. These cells, the products\r\nof the basidia, are not more than four mkm. in length, and give the\r\nfloral organs the appearance of being covered with a whitish dust. The\r\nhoney-dew likewise contains an abundance of conidia, but it is only\r\non dilution that they are precipitated and become easily perceptible;\r\nthe formation of the honey-dew is intimately connected with that of\r\nthe conidia themselves. Ergot in this primary or mycelium stage was\r\nregarded as an independent fungus by Léveillé (1827), who named it\r\n_Sphacelia segetum_. According to Kühn (1863), it may even be directly\r\nby germination of the conidia within the ears of rye.\r\n\r\nThe mycelium penetrates and envelops the caryopsis, with the exception\r\nof the apex, and thereby prevents its further growth, destroying\r\nespecially the epicarp and the embryo. At the base of the caryopsis,\r\nthere is formed by tumefaction and gradual transverse separation of\r\nthe thread-cells of the mycelium, a more compact kernel-like body (the\r\nfuture ergot) violet-black without, white within, which gradually\r\nbut largely increases in size, and ultimately separates from the\r\nmycelium as the loose tissue of the latter dries and shrinks up after\r\nthe completion of its functions. By this growth, the remains of the\r\ncaryopsis, still recognizable by their hairs and by the rudiments of\r\nthe style, as well as by the surviving portions of the mycelium-tissue,\r\nbecome visible above the paleæ on the apex of the mature ergot, now\r\nprojecting prominently from the ear. Very rarely the ergot is crowned\r\nby a fully developed seed; in the commercial drug, the apex is usually\r\nbroken off.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in the process of development just described,\r\nthe very tissue of the caryopsis of the rye does not undergo a\r\n_transformation_, but that it is _simply destroyed_. Neither in\r\nexternal form, nor in anatomical structure does ergot exhibit any\r\nresemblance to a caryopsis or a seed, although its development takes\r\nplace between the flowering time and that at which the rye begins to\r\nripen. It has been regarded as a complete fungus, and as such was named\r\nby De Candolle (1816) _Sclerotium Clavus_ and by Fries _Spermædia\r\nClavus_.\r\n\r\nNo further change in the ergot occurs while it remains in the ear;\r\nbut laid on damp earth, interesting phenomena take place. At certain\r\npoints, small orbicular patches of the rind fold themselves back,\r\nand gradually throw out little white heads. These increase in size,\r\nwhilst the outer layers of the neighbouring tissue gradually lose their\r\nfirmness and become soft and rather granular, at the same time that the\r\ncells, of which they are made up, become empty and extended. In the\r\ninterior of the ergot, the cells retain their oil drops unaltered. The\r\nheads assume a greyish-yellow colour, changing to purple, and finally\r\nafter some weeks stretch themselves towards the light on slender\r\nshining stalks of a pale violet colour. The stalks often attain an inch\r\nin length, with a thickness of about ½ a line. They consist of thin,\r\nparallel, closely-felted cell-threads, devoid of fat oil. Ergot is\r\nsusceptible of this further development only so long as it is fresh,\r\nthat is to say, at most until the next flowering time of rye. Within\r\nthis period however, even fragments are capable of development. There\r\nare sometimes also produced colourless threads of mould which belong\r\nto other fungi, as _Verticillium cylindrosporum_ Corda, and which\r\nfrequently overgrow the _Claviceps_.[2763]\r\n\r\n[2763] Ergot of rye collected by myself in August, placed upon earth in\r\na garden-pot and left in the open air unprotected through the winter,\r\nbegan to develop the _Claviceps_ on the 20th March, and on another\r\noccasion on the 20th April, at which date some sowed in February also\r\nbegan to start, Sharp frost appears to retard the vegetation; thus,\r\nafter the cold winter of 1869-70, _Claviceps_, even in the greenhouse,\r\ndid not make its appearance before the 11th May. The earliest instance\r\nof fully developed _ergots_ which I ever observed, occurred on the\r\n11th of June; more frequently they are seen only in the beginning of\r\nJuly.—F. A. F.\r\n\r\nAt the point where the stalk joins the spherical or somewhat flattened\r\nhead, the latter is depressed and surrounds the stalk with an annular\r\nborder. After a short time there appear on the surface of the head,\r\nwhich is ⅒ of an inch in diameter, a number of brownish warts, in\r\nwhich are the openings of minute cavities, the _conceptacula_ or\r\n_perithecia_. On transverse section, they appear arranged radially\r\nround the circumference of the head. In each cavity are a large number\r\nof delicate sacs, only 3-5 mkm. thick, and about 100 mkm. long, the\r\n_thecæ_ or _asci_, each containing, as is usual in fungi, 8 spores.\r\nThese are simple thread-shaped cells, filled with a homogeneous solid\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nThe thicker ends of the spore-sacs (_asci_) open while still within\r\nthe perithecium; the spores issue united in a bundle, and are emitted\r\nfrom the aperture of the perithecium. In consequence of their somewhat\r\nglutinous consistence, they remain united even after their extrusion,\r\nand form white silky flocks; their number in the 20 or 30 heads\r\nsometimes produced from a single ergot, often exceeds a million. The\r\nheads themselves die in two or three weeks after they have begun to\r\nmake their appearance. They represent the true fructification of the\r\nfungus. This state of the plant appears to have been first noticed in\r\n1801 by Schumacher, who called it _Sphæria_; it was subsequently known\r\nas _Cordiceps_, _Cordyliceps_, _Kentrosporium_, etc., until Tulasne\r\nproved it to be the final stage of development of ergot.\r\n\r\nThe three different forms of this structure, namely, the mycelium,\r\nthe ergot, and the fruit-bearing heads, are therefore merely\r\nsuccessive states of one and the same biennial fungus, which have\r\nbeen appropriately united by Tulasne under the name of _Claviceps\r\npurpurea_. The middle stage forms the _sclerotium_, which occurs in a\r\nlarge number of the most various fungi, and is a special state of rest\r\nof these plants. The direct proof that the mycelium is produced from\r\nspores of the fruit-head sown on ears of rye, was supplied by Kühn in\r\n1863. It has already been mentioned that the same organism is produced\r\nfrom conidia; whence it appears that a twofold formation of ergot is\r\npossible, as is frequently the case in other fungi.\r\n\r\n=Description=—Spurred rye, as found in commerce, consists of fusiform\r\ngrains, which it is convenient to term _ergots_. They are from ⅓\r\nto 1½ inch in length, and ½ to 4 lines in diameter; their form is\r\nsubcylindrical or obtusely prismatic, tapering towards the ends,\r\ngenerally arched, with a longitudinal furrow on each side. At the\r\napex of each ergot, there is often a small whitish easily detached\r\nappendage, while the opposite extremity is somewhat rounded. The\r\nergots are firm, horny, somewhat elastic, have a close fracture, are\r\nbrittle when dry, yet difficult to pulverize. The whitish interior\r\nis frequently laid bare by deep transverse cracks. The tissue is but\r\nimperfectly penetrated by water, even the thinnest sections swelling\r\nbut slightly in that fluid.\r\n\r\nErgot of rye has a peculiar offensive odour, and a mawkish, rancid\r\ntaste. It is apt to become deteriorated by keeping, especially\r\nwhen pulverized, partly from oxidation of the oil, and partly from\r\nthe attacks of a mite of the genus _Trombidium_. To assist its\r\npreservation, it should be thoroughly dried, and kept in closed bottles.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—In fully developed ergot, no organs can be\r\ndistinguished. It consists of uniform, densely felted tissue of short,\r\nthread-like, somewhat thick-walled cells, which are irregularly packed,\r\nand so intimately matted together that it is only by prolonged boiling\r\nof thin slices with potash, and alternate treatment with acids and\r\nether, that the individual cells can be made evident. Without such\r\ntreatment, the cells even in the thinnest sections, show a somewhat\r\nrounded, nearly isodiametric outline. This pseudo-parenchyme of ergot\r\nexhibits therefore an aspect somewhat different from that of the\r\nloosely felted cells (_hyphæ_) of other fungi. Ergot nevertheless is\r\nnot made up of cells differing from those of fungi generally. If thin\r\nlongitudinal slices of the innermost tissue are allowed to remain in\r\na solution of chromic acid containing about 1 per cent., they will\r\ndistinctly show the _hyphæ_, which are however considerably shorter\r\nthan those of other fungi. They contain numerous drops of fat oil, but\r\nneither starch nor crystals. It is remarkable that this nearly empty\r\nand not much thickened parenchyme should form so compact and solid a\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\nThe cell-walls of the tissue of ergot are not coloured blue, even after\r\nprolonged treatment with iodine in solution of potassium iodide; or\r\nwhen the tissue has been previously treated with sulphuric acid, or\r\nkept for days in contact with potash and absolute alcohol at 100° C. In\r\nthis respect the cellulose of fungi differs from that of phanerogamic\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nOf the outermost rows of cells in ergot, a few only are of a violet\r\ncolour, but they are not otherwise distinguishable from the colourless\r\ntissue,—or at most by the somewhat greater thickness of their walls.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The composition of ergot has been elaborately\r\ninvestigated by Wiggers as early as 1830. The drug contains about 30\r\nper cent. of a non-drying, yellowish oil, chiefly consisting of olein,\r\npalmitin, and small proportions of volatile fatty acids, especially\r\nacetic and butyric, combined with glycerin. The large amount of oil\r\nis remarkable; the fungi, dried at 100°, usually contain not more\r\nthan 5 per cent. of fat, mostly much less; they are on the other hand\r\nmuch richer in albumin than ergot of rye. The oil of the latter, as\r\nextracted by bisulphide of carbon, is accompanied by small quantities\r\nof _resin_ and _cholesterin_ (see p. 420). It is erroneous to attribute\r\nto this oil the poisonous properties of ergot, although it has been\r\nshown by Ganser[2764] to display irritating properties when taken in\r\ndoses of about 6 grammes. But the effects observed appear dependent on\r\nthe presence in it of resin.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wenzell (1864), ergot of rye contains two peculiar\r\nalkaloids, which he designated _Ecboline_ and _Ergotine_,[2765] and\r\nclaimed to be the active principles of the drug. They were, however,\r\ngot merely as brownish amorphous substances.\r\n\r\nThe two bases of ergot are, according to Wenzell, combined with\r\n_Ergotic Acid_, the existence of which has been further admitted by\r\nGanser. It is said to be a volatile body yielding crystallizable salts.\r\n\r\nA crystallized colourless alkaloid, _Ergotinine_, C₃₅H₄₀N₄O₆, has been\r\nisolated (1877-1878) by Tanret, a pharmacien of Troyes. He obtained\r\nit to the amount of about 0·04 per cent., some amorphous ergotinine\r\nmoreover being present. Tanret exhausts the powdered drug with boiling\r\nalcohol, which by evaporation affords a fluid resin and an aqueous\r\nsolution, besides a fatty layer. Some ergotinine is removed from the\r\nresin by shaking it with ether, and mixed with the main liquid. This\r\nis acidulated and purified by means of ether. Lastly, the ergotinine\r\nis extracted by adding a slight excess of carbonate of potassium and\r\nshaking with ether, and recrystallizing from alcohol. The solutions\r\nof ergotinine turn very soon greenish and red; they are fluorescent.\r\nSulphuric acid imparts to it a red, violet, and finally blue hue.\r\n\r\nDragendorff and several of his pupils, since 1875, have isolated\r\nthe following _amorphous_ principles of the drug under notice:—(1)\r\n_Sclerotic acid_ (doubtful formula C₁₂H₁₉}NO₉), said to be a very\r\nactive substance, chiefly in subcutaneous injections. About 4 per\r\ncent. of colourless acid may be obtained from good ergot of rye. (2)\r\n_Scleromucin_, a mucilaginous matter, which may be precipitated by\r\nalcohol from aqueous extracts of the drug. Scleromucin when dried is\r\nno longer soluble in water. (3) _Sclererythrin_, the red colouring\r\nmatter, probably allied to anthrachinon and the colouring substances of\r\nmadder, chiefly to purpurin. (4) _Sclerojodin_, a bluish-black powder,\r\nsoluble in alkalis. (5) _Fuscosclerotinic acid._ (6) _Picrosclerotine_,\r\napparently a highly poisonous alkaloid. Lastly (7) _Scleroxanthin_,\r\nC₇H₇O₃ + OH₂; and (8) _Sclerocrystallin_, C₇H₇O₃, have been obtained in\r\ncrystals; their alcoholic solution is but little coloured, yet assumes\r\na violet hue on addition of ferric chloride.\r\n\r\nTanret also observed in ergot of rye a volatile _camphoraceous\r\nsubstance_.\r\n\r\nErgot, in common with other fungi,[2766] contains a sugar termed\r\n_Mycose_, closely allied to cane-sugar, and probably identical with\r\n_Trehalose_ (see p. 417). Mycose crystallizes in rhombic octohedra,\r\nhaving the composition C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ + 2H₂O. Mitscherlich obtained of it\r\nabout one-tenth per cent. It appears that the sugar exuded in the first\r\nstage of growth of the fungus,—the so-called _rye honey-dew_,—is in\r\nits principal characters different from mycose. Instead of the latter,\r\nMitscherlich, as well as Fiedler and Ludwig, sometimes obtained from\r\nergot _Mannite_.\r\n\r\n[2764] _Archiv der Pharm._ cxliv. (1870) 200.\r\n\r\n[2765] The name _Ergotine_ has also been given to a medicinal extract\r\nof ergot, prepared after a method devised by Bonjean, a pharmacien of\r\nChambéry, vide _Journ. de Pharm._ iv. (1843) 107; Pereira, _Elem. of\r\nMat. Med._ ii. (1850) 1012.\r\n\r\n[2766] See Müntz in _Comptes Rendus_, lxxvi. (1873) 649.\r\n\r\nSchoonbroodt also found in ergot _Lactic Acid_. Several other chemists\r\nhave further proved the presence of acetic and formic acids.\r\n\r\nStarch is entirely wanting in ergot at all times. The drug yields about\r\n3 per cent. of nitrogen, corresponding probably to a large amount of\r\nalbuminoid matter. Ganser, however, obtained only 3·2 per cent. of\r\nalbumin _soluble in water_.\r\n\r\nWhen ergot or its alcoholic extract is treated with an alkali\r\nit yields, as products of the decomposition of the albuminoid\r\nmatters, ammonia or ammonia-bases, according to Ludwig and Stahl,\r\n_Methylamine_,—according to others, _Trimethylamine_. Manassewitz, as\r\nwell as Wenzell, state that phosphate of trimethylamine is present\r\nin an aqueous extract of ergot, but Ganser ascertained that no such\r\nbase _pre-exists_ in ergot. We have found that the crystals which\r\nabound in the extract, after it has been kept for some time, are an\r\nacid phosphate of sodium and ammonium with a small proportion of\r\nsulphate.[2767]\r\n\r\n=Production and Commerce=—Ergot of rye is to be met with in all the\r\ncountries producing cereals; we have seen it in the high valleys of the\r\nAlps, and Schübeler states that it grows in Norway, as far north as 60°\r\nN. lat.\r\n\r\nThe drug is chiefly imported into London from Vigo in Spain and from\r\nTenerife; it is also shipped from Hamburg and France. Dr. de Lanessan,\r\nwriting to one of us from Vigo in 1872, remarks that vast quantities of\r\nrye are grown in Galicia, and that owing to the humidity of the climate\r\nthe grain is extensively ergotized,—in fact the parasite is present\r\nin one ear out of every three. At the time of harvest the ergots are\r\npicked out, and the rye is thus rendered fit for food.\r\n\r\nSouthern and Central Russia furnish considerable supplies of the drug.\r\nIn the central parts of Europe, ergot does not everywhere occur in\r\nsufficient abundance to be collected, and it greatly diminishes as the\r\nstate of agriculture improves. We have noticed that ergot from Odessa\r\nwas of a slaty hue and in much smaller grains than that from Spain.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—Ergot is principally used on account of its specific action on\r\nthe uterus in parturition.\r\n\r\n=Other Varieties of Ergot=—_Ergot of Wheat_ (Triticum vulgare), which\r\nis in shorter and thicker ergots than that of rye, is picked out by\r\nhand in some parts of Italy and France, from grain intended to be used\r\nfor the manufacture of vermicelli and other pastes; and such ergot is\r\nsold to druggists. Carbonneaux Le Perdriel[2768] has endeavoured to\r\nshow that it is less prone to become deteriorated by age than that\r\nof rye, and that it never produces the deleterious effects sometimes\r\noccasioned by the latter.\r\n\r\n[2767] The red colour of an alcoholic solution may serve for the\r\ndetection of small quantities of ergot in flour. The reaction with\r\npotash, and evolution of the characteristic odour of herring brine may\r\nassist in the same object. Extraction of the fatty oil with carbon\r\nbisulphide may also be recommended as a test, inasmuch as good cereal\r\ngrains contain but a very small percentage of fat.\r\n\r\n[2768] _De l’Ergot de Froment et de ses propriétés méd._ (thèse)\r\nMontpellier, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe same writer asserts that _Ergot of Oat_ is sometimes collected and\r\nsold either _per se_, or mixed with that of rye. It differs from the\r\nlatter in the ergots being considerably more slender.\r\n\r\nErgot of the North African grass _Arundo Ampelodesmos_ Cirillo, known\r\nas _Diss_, has been collected for use, and according to Lallemant[2769]\r\nis twice as active as that of rye. It is from 1 to 3 inches long by\r\nonly about ⅒ of an inch broad, generally arched, or in the large\r\nergots twisted spirally. We find it to share the structural character\r\nof the ergot of rye; it is in all probability the same formation, yet\r\nremarkably modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALGÆ (FLORIDEÆ).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHONDRUS CRISPUS.\r\n\r\n_Fucus Hibernicus_; _Carrageen_,[2770] _Irish Moss_; F. _Mousse\r\nd’Irlande_, _Mousse perlée_; G. _Knorpeltang_, _Irländisches Moos_,\r\n_Perlmoos_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Chondrus crispus_ Lyngbye (_Fucus crispus_ L.),\r\na sea weed of the class _Florideæ_, abundant on rocky sea-shores of\r\nEurope from the North Cape to Gibraltar; not frequent however in the\r\nBaltic, and altogether wanting in the Mediterranean, but largely met\r\nwith on the eastern coasts of North America.\r\n\r\n=History=—_Chondrus crispus_ was figured in 1699 by Morison,[2771] yet\r\nonly Todhunter at Dublin introduced it to the notice of the medical\r\nprofession in England in 1831, and shortly afterwards it attracted some\r\nattention in Germany. It was never admitted to the London or British\r\npharmacopœia, and is but little esteemed in medicine.\r\n\r\n=Description=—The entire plant is collected: in the fresh state it is\r\nsoft and cartilaginous, varying in colour from yellowish-green to livid\r\npurple or purplish-brown, but becoming, after washing and exposure\r\nto the sun, white or yellowish, and when dry, shrunken, horny and\r\ntranslucent.\r\n\r\nThe base is a small flattened disc, from which springs a frond\r\nor thallus 4 to 6 inches or more in length, having a slender\r\nsubcylindrical stem, expanding fan-like into wedge-shaped segments,\r\nof very variable breadth, flat or curled, and truncate, emarginate or\r\nbifid at the summit.\r\n\r\nThe fructification[2772] consists of tetraspores or cystocarps, rising\r\nbut slightly from the substance of the thallus, and appearing as little\r\nwart-like protuberances.\r\n\r\nIn cold water, carrageen swells up to its original bulk, and acquires\r\na distinct seaweed-like smell. A quantity of water equal to 20 or\r\n30 times its weight, boiled with it for ten minutes, solidifies on\r\ncooling to a pale mawkish jelly.\r\n\r\n[2769] _Etude sur l’Ergot du Diss_, Alger et Paris, 1863; _Journ. de\r\nPharm._ i. (1865) 444.\r\n\r\n[2770] _Carrageen_ in Irish signifies _moss of the rock_. We learn from\r\nan Irish scholar that it would be more correctly written _carraigeen_.\r\n\r\n[2771] _Plantar. hist. universal._ Oxon. iii. tab. 11.\r\n\r\n[2772] See Luerssen (quoted at p. 734) i. 124 _et seq._\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The tissue of _Chondus crispus_ is made up of\r\nglobular or elongated, thick-walled cells. The superficial layers on\r\nboth sides of the lobes constitute a kind of peel, easily separable in\r\nmicroscopic sections. The interior or medullary part exhibits a much\r\nless densely packed tissue formed of larger cells. The larger cavities\r\nof this tissue contain a granular mucilaginous matter, assuming a\r\nslight violet tinge on addition of iodine. In water however, the\r\ncell-walls swell up so as to form a gelatinous mass, in which separate\r\ncells can at last be scarcely distinguished.[2773] In the fresh state,\r\nits cells also contain granules of chlorophyll imbued with a red\r\nmatter, termed _Phyco-erythrin_. But by washing and exposure to the\r\nair, these colouring substances are removed or greatly altered, and are\r\nno longer visible in the commercial drug.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The constituents of carrageen are those\r\ngenerally found in marine algæ, especially as regards the mucilage.\r\nThis latter is insoluble in an ammoniacal solution of copper\r\n(Schweizer’s test); by the action of fuming nitric acid, it yields,\r\nin common with gum, an abundance of mucic acid. The mucilage of\r\ncarrageen, like many similar bodies, obstinately retains inorganic\r\nmatter; after it had three times been dissolved in water, and as many\r\ntimes precipitated with alcohol, we found it still to yield the same\r\nquantity of ash as the raw drug itself, that is to say, more than 15\r\nper cent. The mucilage, perfectly dried, is a tough horny substance, of\r\na greyish colour; it quickly swells up in water, forming a jelly which\r\nis precipitable by neutral acetate of lead.\r\n\r\nBy boiling carrageen for a week with water containing 5 per cent.\r\nof sulphuric acid, Bente (1876) obtained crystals of _lævulinic\r\nacid_, C₅H₈O₃, and an amorphous sugar. The former is also afforded by\r\ncellulose of pine wood and by paper.\r\n\r\nAccording to Blondeau,[2774] the mucilage of carrageen contains 21 per\r\ncent. of nitrogen and 2·5 of sulphur, a statement which we are able to\r\npoint out as erroneous. We find in it no sulphur, and only 0·88 per\r\ncent. of nitrogen. The drug itself yielded us not more than 1·012 per\r\ncent. of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nWhen thin slices of the plant are treated with alcoholic potash, and\r\nthen after washing left for 24 hours in contact with a solution of\r\niodine in potassium iodide, they acquire a deep blue; yet, starch\r\ngranules are not found in this seaweed. Lastly in connexion with\r\ncarrageen may be mentioned _Fucusol_, an oily liquid isomeric with\r\nfurfurol, obtained by boiling seaweeds with dilute sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n=Commerce=—The plant is collected on the west and north-west coast\r\nof Ireland: Sligo is said to be a great depôt for it. Carrageen of\r\nsuperior quality is sometimes imported from Hamburg.\r\n\r\n[2773] Alcohol, glycerin or a fatty oil are the liquids most suited for\r\nthe microscopic examination of this drug.\r\n\r\n[2774] _Journ. de Pharm._ ii. (1865) 159.\r\n\r\nThe largest quantities of carrageen, sometimes half a million pounds\r\na year, are gathered near Minot Ledge lighthouse, Scituate, Plymouth\r\ncounty, on the coast of Massachusetts, where a systematic process of\r\npreparing it for the market is adopted.[2775]\r\n\r\n=Uses=—The mucilaginous decoction and jelly which carrageen affords are\r\npopular remedies in pulmonary and other complaints; but as nutriment\r\nsuch preparations are much over-estimated.[2776]\r\n\r\nCarrageen is sometimes used for feeding cows and calves; and under the\r\nname of _Alga marina_, for stuffing mattresses. It is largely used\r\nfor industrial purposes, like other mucilaginous matter. Its mucilage\r\nserves for thickening the colours employed in calico-printing, and as\r\nsize for paper and for cotton goods. In America it is used for fining\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes=—_Gigartina mammillosa_[2777] J. Agardh (_Chondrus\r\nmammillosus_ Grev.) is collected indiscriminately with _Ch. crispus_.\r\nIt is distinguished from the latter chiefly by having the flat portion\r\nof the thallus beset with elevated or stalked tubercles, bearing the\r\ncystocarps; but it has the same properties. _G. acicularis_ Lamouroux,\r\na species common on the coasts of France and Spain, and having slender\r\ncylindrical branches, is occasionally collected along with _Chondrus\r\ncrispus_. Dalmon (1874) who has examined it, asserts it to be less\r\nsoluble in boiling water than true carrageen. Small quantities of other\r\nseaweeds are often present through the negligence of the collectors.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUCUS AMYLACEUS.\r\n\r\n_Alga Zeylanica_; _Ceylon Moss_,[2778] _Jaffna Moss_.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Origin=—_Sphærococcus lichenoides_ Agardh. (_Gracillaria\r\nlichenoides_ Grev., _Plocaria candida_ Nees), a light purple or\r\ngreenish seaweed, belonging to the class _Florideæ_, occurring on the\r\ncoasts of Ceylon, Burma, and the Malay islands.[2779]\r\n\r\n=History=—Ceylon moss has long been in use among the inhabitants of the\r\nIndian Archipelago and the Chinese. It is probably one of the plants\r\ndescribed by Rumphius[2780] as _Alga coralloides_. In recent times it\r\nwas brought to the notice of European physicians by O’Shaughnessy.[2781]\r\n\r\n=Description=—The plant, which as found in commerce is opaque and\r\nwhite, having been deprived of colour by drying in the sun and air,\r\nconsists of cylindrical ramifying stems or filaments, ⅒ of an inch\r\nin diameter and from 1 to 6 or more inches in length. The main stems\r\nbear numerous branches, simple or giving off slender secondary or\r\ntertiary ramifications, ending in a short point. When moistened, the\r\nplant increases a little in volume, becomes rather translucent, and\r\nfrequently exhibits whitish globular or mammiform fruits (cystocarps).\r\nIt is somewhat friable, and after drying at 100° C. may easily be\r\npowdered. It is devoid of taste and smell, in this respect differing\r\nfrom most sea weeds.\r\n\r\n[2775] Bates in _Amer. Journ. of Pharm._ 1868. 417; also _Pharm.\r\nJourn._ xi. (1869) and viii. (1877) 304.\r\n\r\n[2776] A person must eat a _pound_ of stiff jelly made of the powdered\r\nseaweed before he would have swallowed _half an ounce_ of dry solid\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n[2777] Fig. in Luerssen (quoted at p. 734) 126.\r\n\r\n[2778] For convenience we accept the popular name of _moss_, though it\r\nis no longer in accordance with the signification of the word in modern\r\nscience (see p. 737, note 2).\r\n\r\n[2779] The _Pharmacopœia of India_ (1868) names _Sphærococcus\r\nconfervoides_ Ag. (_Gracillaria_ Grev.), a plant of the Atlantic Ocean\r\nand Mediterranean, not uncommon on the shores of Britain, as furnishing\r\na portion of the drug under notice. Specimens which we have examined\r\nare widely different in structure from _S. lichenoides_, and are\r\napparently devoid of starch.\r\n\r\n[2780] _Herb. Amboin._ vi. lib. xi c. 56.\r\n\r\n[2781] _Indian Journ. of Med. Science_, Calcutta, March, 1834; _Bengal\r\nDispensatory_, 1841. 668.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Structure=—The transverse section shows a loose tissue\r\nmade up of large empty cells, enclosed by a cortical zone 30 to 70\r\nmkm. thick. This zone consists of small cells, loaded with globular\r\nstarch granules, from less than 1 up to 3 mkm. in diameter, so densely\r\npacked as to form what seems at first sight a single mass in each cell.\r\nIn the larger cells the granules are attached to the walls; they do\r\nnot display in polarized light the usual cross. The thick walls of\r\nthe cells show a stratified structure, especially after having been\r\nmoistened with chromic acid; on addition of a solution of iodine in an\r\nalkaline iodide, they assume a deep brown, but the starch granules,\r\nwhich also abound in the cystocarps, display the usual blue tint.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Composition=—The drug, as examined by O’Shaughnessy, yielded\r\nin 100 parts of vegetable jelly 54·5, starch 15·0, ligneous fibre\r\n(cellulose?) 18·0, mucilage 4·0, inorganic salts 7·5.\r\n\r\nCold water removes the mucilage, which, after due concentration, may\r\nbe precipitated by neutral acetate of lead. This mucilage, when boiled\r\nfor some time with nitric acid, produces oxalic acid and microscopic\r\ncrystals of mucic acid (beautifully seen by polarized light), soluble\r\nin boiling water and precipitating on cooling. With one part of\r\nthe drug and 100 parts of boiling water a thick liquid is obtained\r\nwhich affords transparent precipitates with neutral acetate of lead\r\nor alcohol, in the same way as carrageen. With 50 parts of water, a\r\ntransparent tasteless jelly, devoid of viscosity, is produced; in\r\ncommon with the mucilage, it furnishes mucic acid, if treated with\r\nnitric acid. Micro-chemical tests do not manifest albuminous matter in\r\nthis plant.\r\n\r\nSome chemists have regarded the jelly extracted by boiling water as\r\nidentical with pectin, but the fact requires proof. Payen[2782] called\r\nit _Gelose_, and found it composed of carbon 42·77, hydrogen 5·77,\r\nand oxygen 51·45 per cent. Gum Arabic contains carbon 42·12, hydrogen\r\n6·41, and oxygen 51·47 = C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁. Payen’s gelose imparts a gelatinous\r\nconsistence to 500 parts of water; it is extracted by boiling\r\nwater from the plant previously exhausted by cold water slightly\r\nacidulated.[2783]\r\n\r\nThe inorganic salts of Ceylon moss consist, according to O’Shaughnessy,\r\nof sulphates, phosphates, and chlorides of sodium and calcium, with\r\nneither iodide nor bromide. Dried at 100° C., it yielded us 9·15 per\r\ncent. of ash.\r\n\r\n=Uses=—A decoction of Ceylon moss made palatable by sugar and\r\naromatics, has been recommended as a demulcent, and a light article\r\nof food for invalids. In the Indian Archipelago and in China, immense\r\nquantities of this and of some other species of seaweed[2784] are used\r\nfor making jelly and for other purposes.\r\n\r\n[2782] _Comptes Rendus_, xlix. (1859) 521; _Pharm. Journ._ i. (1860)\r\n470. 508.\r\n\r\n[2783] Gelose even in the moist state is but little prone to change,\r\nand the jelly made by the Chinese as a sweetmeat which consists mainly\r\nof it, will keep good for years.\r\n\r\n[2784] Consult Martius, _Neues Jahrb. f.

(Years of birth and death\r\nunknown.) He was a student of medicine and natural sciences in the\r\nUniversities of Salamanca and Alcalá, and a teacher and physician in\r\nthe University of Coimbra (or Lissabon?). In 1534 Garcia accompanied\r\nMartim Affonso de Souza, grand admiral of the Indian fleet, to Goa, and\r\nlived there as a royal physician (Physico d’El Rey) to the hospital.\r\nGarcia appears to have been still living there in 1562, when he\r\nobtained the vice-regal privilege for his book “_Coloquios_ dos simples\r\ne drogas he cousas mediçinais da India, e assi dalguãs frutas achadas\r\nnella ande se tratam.... Impresso em Goa, por Joannes de endem as x\r\nde Abril de 1563,” 436 pp., 4°. (British Museum).—F. A. von Varnhagen\r\nhas caused the Coloquios to be reprinted in 1872 at Lisbon. Garcia\r\nde Orta’s Coloquios are, notwithstanding the utterly diffused style\r\nof the work, a precious source of information on eastern drugs. They\r\nhad the good chance to be translated, as early as the year 1567, by\r\nClusius, who omitted the insignificant parts of the book, re-arranged\r\nit conveniently, and added valuable notes.

There are many editions, the first of which, as examined in\r\n1876 by one of us (F. A. F..) in the library of San Marco, Venice, is\r\nfound to bear the following title:—“Qui comincia la utilissima opera\r\nchiamata _Taripha_, la qvol tracta de ogni sorte de pexi e misure\r\nconrispondenti per tuto il mondo fata e composta per lo excelente e\r\neximio Miser Bartholomeo di _Paxi_ da Venezia.

Rhys Gryg (_i.e._ the\r\nHoarse), prince of South Wales (died in 1233 at Llandeilo Vawr), had\r\nhis domestic physician, namely Rhiwallon, who was assisted by his\r\nthree sons Cadwgan, Gruffydd, Einion, from a place called Myddvai, in\r\nthe present county of Caermarthen. They made a collection of recipes,\r\nthe original manuscript of which is in the British Museum. Another\r\ncollection has been compiled, from the original sources, by Howel the\r\nPhysician, son of Rhys, son of Llewelyn, son of Philip the Physician,\r\na lineal descendant of Einion, the son of Rhiwallon. Both these\r\ncompilations have been published at Llandovery in 1861, together with a\r\ntranslation, by John Pughe, under the above title (470 pp.)\r\n\r\nSee pages 6. 40. 65. 71. 141. 157. 161. 170. 180. 299. 305. 310. 316.\r\n334. 380. 383. 393. 401. 450. 464. 469. 476. 488. 556. 625. 635. 642.\r\n652.\r\n\r\n=Pires=, Tomé (or Pyres, Pirez, as he also writes his name himself),\r\na Portuguese apothecary. He was the first ambassador sent, probably\r\nin 1511, from Europe, or at least from Portugal, to China. Pires\r\naddressed, in 1512-1516, several letters from Cochin and Malacca to\r\nthe Admiral Affonso d’Albuquerque and to King Manuel of Portugal.\r\nOne of them, written January 27, 1516, from Cochin to the King,\r\nenumerates many drugs which were to be met with in that place—“dando\r\nl-lhe noticias das drogas da India,” says the writer. This letter,\r\nstill existing in the Real y Nacional Archivo da Torre do Tombo (corpo\r\nchronologico, part i. fasc. 19, No. 102), was communicated in 1838 by\r\nBishop Condo Don Francisco de San Luiz to the Portuguese Pharmaceutical\r\nSociety, and published in their “Jornal de Socied. Pharm. Lusit.\r\nii. (1838) 36.” It will also be found in the pamphlet[2785] “Elogio\r\nhistorico e noticia completa de Thomé Pires, pharmaceutico e primeiro\r\nnaturalista da India; e o primeiro embaixador europeo a China. Memoria\r\npublicada na Gazeta de Pharmacia por Pedro José da Silva.” ...\r\nLisboa, 1866. 47 pp. (“y 22 fac simile de sua signatura”). We had,\r\nmoreover, before us an authentic copy of the letter under notice,\r\nobligingly written 1st December, 1869, for one of us by Senhor\r\nJoaquim Urbano de Veiga, the Secretary of the Sociedad Pharmaceutica\r\nLusitana. According to _Colmeiro_, La Botánica y los Botánicos de la\r\nPeninsula Hispano-Lusitana, Madrid, 1858. 148, Peres was attached to\r\nthe factory of Malacca as a “scribano” (secretary?) and “por tener\r\nconocimientos farmacéuticos,” and was sent to China, with the character\r\nof an ambassador, in order to examine more freely the plants. He was\r\nimprisoned, says Colmeiro, at Pekin, and there died soon after 1521\r\nin prison. Yet _Abel Rémusat_, in the 34th volume of the “Biographie\r\nuniverselle” (1823), p. 498, and also in his “Nouveaux mélanges\r\nasiatiques” ii. (1828) 203, states that Pires proceeded first to\r\nCanton, and reached Pekin in 1521. From this place he was sent to\r\nCanton and imprisoned for many years from political causes. He was\r\nstill living in 1543.\r\n\r\nSee pages 43. 255. 681.\r\n\r\n[2785] Library of the Pharm. Soc. of Great Britain, London, among the\r\n“Pamphlets. No. 30” (Sept. 1878).\r\n\r\n=Piso=, Willem. The Dutch, having conquered in 1630 from the Spanish\r\nthe north-eastern part of the Brazilian coast, between Natal and Porto\r\nCalvo, Count _Johann Moriz von Nassau-Siegen_ was appointed, in 1636,\r\nGovernor-General of these possessions. He left them in 1644; the\r\nhistory of his reign is contained in the work of _Barlæus_, Rerum per\r\nOctoennium ... gestarum ... historia, Amstelodami, 1647. The Count had\r\nalso instituted a scientific exploration of the environs of Pernambuco\r\n(or Recife), his residence, by his physician _Piso_ and _Marcgraf_, the\r\nfriend of the latter (see M.), who lived also at the Count’s court.\r\nThey devoted several years (from 1638 to 1641) zealously to their\r\ntask. The results of their investigations are found in—(1) Historia\r\nnaturalis Brasiliæ, published by Joh. de Laet, Lugd. Bat., 1643. (2)\r\nPisonis de _medicina brasiliensi_ libri iv., et G.

He compiled the remarkable dictionary of drugs, “Liber de\r\nsimplici medicina,” which was extremely appreciated during the next\r\ncenturies, and even reprinted as late as the beginning of the 17th\r\ncentury. The work begins with a definition of the signification of the\r\nterm Simplex medicina; it is in these words: _Circa instans_ negotium\r\nde simplicibus medicinis nostrum versatur propositum. Simplex autem\r\nmedicina est, quæ talis est, qualis a natura producitur: ut gariofilus,\r\nnux muscata et similia.... The work of Platearius is therefore usually\r\nquoted under the name _Circa instans_. The list of the 273 drugs\r\nenumerated in “Circa instans” will be found in Choulant (_l.c._ at\r\np. 751), p. 298. We have referred to “Circa instans” as contained in\r\nthe volumes—Dispensarium magistri Nicolai præpositi ad aromatarios,\r\nLugduni, 1517, or Practica Jo.

He spent 25 years, from 1271 to 1295, in Asia, chiefly in\r\nChina. The account of his travels was written, in French, in 1298, by\r\n_Rusticiano_ of Pisa, and published since in numerous translations and\r\nabstracts. We have chiefly referred to the two following excellent\r\nworks: (1) _Pauthier._ Le livre de _Marco Polo_, publié pour la\r\npremière fois d’après trois manuscrits inédits de la Bibliothèque\r\nimpériale de Paris, 1865.

Another work of the same\r\nauthor, the _Phytognomica_, Naples, 1583, may be mentioned as one of\r\nthe chief works treating on the “Doctrine of Signatures.” There are\r\nseveral editions of it, usually containing the curious figures of the\r\ntubers of orchids as especially connected with that superstitious\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nSee pages 118. 263. 385. 479. 526. 580. 653. 655.\r\n\r\n=Præpositus=, Nicolaus, one of the eminent physicians of the school of\r\nSalerno (see S.) living in the first half of the 12th century.

It was first printed in the original language\r\nat Calcutta, 2 vols., 1835-1836, and afterwards translated under\r\nthe name _Susrutas Ayurvedas_, id est medicinæ systema a venerabili\r\n_D’hanvantare_ demonstratum, a Susruta discipulo compositum. Nunc\r\nprimum ex Sanskrita in Latinum sermonem vertit.... Fr. Hessler,\r\nErlangæ, 3 vols., 1844-1850. And by the same translator, Commentarii et\r\nannotationes in Susrutæ ayurvedam, 1852-1855. Susruta was once supposed\r\nto have written centuries before Christ, but chiefly the researches of\r\nProf. Haas, London, in the _Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen\r\nGesellschaft_, xxx. (1876) 617 _sqq._ and xxxi. (1877) 647, make it not\r\nimprobable that the Sanskrit “Susruta” might have been generated from\r\nthe Greek Hippokrates by way of the intermediate form “Bukrat.” The\r\noldest testimony as to the time of Susruta (and Charaka, see before) is\r\nthe statement of Ibn Abu Oseibiah, in the 13th century, that Susruta\r\nhad been translated into Arabic about the end of the 8th century.\r\n\r\nSee pages 154. 188. 211. 225. 295. 315. 421. 425. 436. 503. 547. 572.\r\n644.\r\n\r\n=Tabernæmontanus=, Jacob Theodor, physician at Heidelberg; died A.D.\r\n1590.

This singular personage\r\nhaving been apprenticed to Dear, an apothecary of Cambridge, settled\r\nin Essex, where he practised medicine with much success. He afterwards\r\ncame to London, and in 1672 published a small book called Πυρετολογία,\r\n_a rational account of the cause and cure of agues_ (London, 12°). As\r\nstated at page 344, he was appointed physician to the king, and on 27th\r\nJuly of the same year, received the honour of knighthood at Whitehall.\r\nBut he was not a member of the College of Physicians; and to save him\r\nfrom attack, Charles II. caused a letter to be written restraining\r\nthat body from interfering with him in his medical practice. (Baker,\r\n_l.c._ at page 344, note 1). The appointment as royal physician, made\r\nin consideration of “good and acceptable services performed,” led\r\nto the issuing of a patent under the Privy Seal, dated 7th August,\r\n1678, granting to Sir Robert Talbor an annuity of £100 per annum,\r\ntogether with the profits and privileges appertaining to a physician\r\nin ordinary to the sovereign. In 1679 Talbor visited France and Spain,\r\nas recorded in the _Recueil des nouvelles_ etc. pendant l’année 1679\r\n(Paris, 1780) 466 (this includes the _Gazette de France_, 23rd Sept.,\r\n1679). The journey to Spain he made in the suite of the young queen of\r\nSpain, Louise d’Orléans, niece of Louis XIV., of whom he is described\r\nas _premier médecin_. During Talbor’s absence, his practice in London\r\nwas carried on by his brother, Dr. John Talbor, as is proved by an\r\nadvertisement in the _True News_ or _Mercurius Anglicus_, January\r\n7-10, 1679. In France Talbor had the good fortune to cure the Dauphin\r\nof an attack of fever, and also treated with success other eminent\r\npersons. (See _Lettres de Madame de Sévigné_, nouv. ed. tome v., 1862,\r\n559; also tome vi., letters of 15th and 29th Sept, and 6th Oct. 1679.)\r\nThe physicians both in England and France were exceedingly jealous of\r\nthe successes of an irregular practitioner like Talbor, and averse to\r\nadmit the merits of his practice. Yet D’Aquin, first physician to Louis\r\nXIV., prescribed _Vin de Quinquina_, as well as powdered bark, for the\r\nking in 1686.—See J. A. Le Roi, J. _Journal de la santé du roi Louis\r\nXIV._, Paris, 1862. 171. 431. But Talbor’s happy results brought him\r\ninto favour with Louis XIV., who induced him, in consideration of a sum\r\nof 2,000 louis d’or and an annual pension of 2,000 livres, to explain\r\nhis mode of treatment, which proved to consist in the administration of\r\nconsiderable doses of cinchona bark infused in wine, as will be seen\r\nin the pamphlet: _Les admirables qualitez du Kinkina confirmées par\r\nplusieurs expériences_, Paris, 1689. 12°. Talbor did not long enjoy his\r\nprosperity, for he died in 1681, aged about 40 years. He was buried in\r\nTrinity Church, Cambridge, where a monumental inscription describes\r\nhim as—“_Febrium malleus_” and physician to Charles II., Louis XIV,\r\nand the Dauphin of France. In Talbor’s will, proved by his widow, Dame\r\nElizabeth Talbor, alias Tabor, relict and executrix, 18th Nov. 1861,\r\nand preserved at Doctors’ Commons, mention is made of an only son,\r\nPhilip Louis.\r\n\r\nSee page 344.\r\n\r\n=Theophrastos Eresios=, of Eresos, in the island of Lesbos, about\r\n370-285 B.C. The earliest botanical author in Europe, having consigned\r\nin his works, written about the year 314 B.C. or later, an admirable\r\namount of excellent observations, either of his own, or, as many\r\nsuggest, originated from Aristotle. Among the numerous editions of\r\nTheophrast’s works (printed as early as A.D. 1483) we may point out\r\nWimmer’s Latin translations, tom. i. _Historia plantarum_, tom. ii. _De\r\nCausis plantarum._ Leipzig, 1854; or the French edition of the same\r\ntranslator, Théophraste, Oeuvres complètes.

Important as are his\r\nattempts to establish a scientific classification of plants, his merits\r\nas a careful observer (1700-1702) of eastern plants are of still more\r\nweight from a pharmaceutical standpoint. The latter is evidenced by his\r\nRelations d’un _voyage_ du Levant.... Paris, 1717, 2 vols.\r\n\r\nSee pages 163. 175.\r\n\r\n=Tragus= (Bock), Hieronymus, 1498-1554.
