Suit\r\n     your own carriage thereto, by which insinuation you will make their\r\n     converse more free and open. Let your discourse be more in querys\r\n     and doubtings than peremptory assertions or disputings, it being\r\n     the designe of travelers to learne, not to teach. Besides, it will\r\n     persuade your acquaintance that you have the greater esteem of\r\n     them, and soe make them more ready to communicate what they know to\r\n     you; whereas nothing sooner occasions disrespect and quarrels than\r\n     peremptorinesse. You will find little or no advantage in seeming\r\n     wiser, or much more ignorant than your company. Seldom discommend\r\n     anything though never so bad, or doe it but moderately, lest you\r\n     bee unexpectedly forced to an unhansom retraction. It is safer to\r\n     commend any thing more than is due, than to discommend a thing soe\r\n     much as it deserves; for commendations meet not soe often with\r\n     oppositions, or, at least, are not usually soe ill resented by men\r\n     that think otherwise, as discommendations; and you will insinuate\r\n     into men's favour by nothing sooner than seeming to approve and\r\n     commend what they like; but beware of doing it by a comparison.\r\n\r\n     --_Sir Isaac Newton to one of his pupils_\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR ISAAC NEWTON\r\n\r\nAn honest farmer, neither rich nor poor, was Isaac Newton. He was\r\nmarried to Harriet Ayscough in February, Sixteen Hundred Forty-two.\r\n\r\nBoth were strong, intelligent and full of hope. Neither had any\r\neducation to speak of; they belonged to England's middle class--that\r\noft-despised and much ridiculed middle class which is the hope of the\r\nworld. Accounts still in existence show that their income was thirty\r\npounds a year. It was for them to toil all the week, go to church on\r\nSunday, and twice or thrice in a year attend the village fairs or\r\nindulge in a holiday where hard cider played an important part.\r\n\r\nIsaac had served his two years in the army, taken a turn at sea, and got\r\nhis discharge-papers. Now he had married the lass of his choice, and\r\nsettled down in the little house on an estate in Lincolnshire where his\r\nfather was born and died.\r\n\r\nSpring came and the roses clambered over the stone walls; the bobolinks\r\nplayed hide-and-seek in the waving grass of the meadows; the skylarks\r\nsang and poised and soared; the hedgerows grew white with\r\nhawthorn-blossoms and musical with the chirp of sparrows; the cattle\r\nranged through the fragrant clover \"knee-deep in June.\"\r\n\r\nOftentimes the young wife worked with her husband in the fields, or went\r\nwith him to market. Great plans were laid as to what they would do next\r\nyear, and the year after, and how they would provide for coming age and\r\ngrow old together, here among the oaks and the peace and plenty of\r\nLincolnshire.\r\n\r\nIn such a country, with such a climate, it seems as if one could almost\r\nmake repair equal waste, and thus keep death indefinitely at bay. But\r\nall men, even the strongest, are living under a death sentence, with but\r\nan indefinite reprieve. And even yet, with all of our science and\r\nhealth, we can not fully account for those diseases which seemingly pick\r\nthe very best flower of sinew and strength.\r\n\r\nIsaac Newton, the strong and rugged farmer, sickened and died in a week.\r\n\"The result of a cold caught when sweaty and standing in a draft,\" the\r\nsurgeon explained. \"The act of God to warn us all of the vanity of\r\nlife.\" Acute pneumonia, perhaps, is what we would call it--a fever that\r\nburned out the bellows in a week.\r\n\r\nIn such cases the very strength of the man seems to supply fuel for the\r\nflames. And so just as the Autumn came with changing leaves, the young\r\nwife was left to fight the battle of life alone--alone, save for the\r\nold, old miracle that her life supported another. A wife, a widow, a\r\nmother--all within a year!\r\n\r\nOn Christmas-Day the babe was born--born where most men die: in\r\nobscurity. He was so weak and frail that none but the mother believed he\r\nwould live.\r\n\r\nThe doctor quoted a line from \"Richard the Third,\" \"Sent before my time\r\ninto this breathing world scarce half made up,\" and gave the infant into\r\nthe keeping of an old nurse with an ominous shake of the head, and went\r\nhis way, absolved. His time was too valuable to waste on such a useless\r\nhuman mite.\r\n\r\nThe persistent words of the mother that the child should not, must not\r\ndie, possibly had something to do with keeping the breath of life in the\r\npuny man-child. The fond mother had given him the name of his father,\r\neven before birth! He was to live to do the work that the man now dead\r\nhad hoped to do; that is, live a long and honest life, and leave the\r\nfair acres more valuable than he found them.\r\n\r\nSuch was the inauspicious beginning of what Herbert Spencer declared was\r\nthe greatest life since Aristotle studied the starry universe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOutside of India the lot of widows is not especially to be pitied. A\r\nwidow has beautiful dreams, while the married woman copes with the stern\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nThen, no phase of life is really difficult when you accept it; and the\r\nmemory of a great love lost is always a blessing and a benediction to\r\nthe one who endures the first cruel shock.\r\n\r\nThe young widow looked after her little estate, and with perhaps some\r\nsmall assistance from her parents, lived comfortably and as happily as\r\none has a right to in this vale of tears. Her baby boy had grown strong\r\nand well: by the time he was two years old he was quite the equal of\r\nmost babies--and his mother thought, beyond them.\r\n\r\nIt is quite often stoutly declared by callow folks that mother-love is\r\nthe strongest and most enduring love in the world, but the wise waste no\r\nwords on such an idle proposition. Mother-love retires into the shadow\r\nwhen the other kind appears.\r\n\r\nWhen the Reverend Barnabas Smith began, unconsciously, to make eyes at\r\nthe Widow Newton over his prayer-book, the good old dames whose business\r\nit is to look after these things, and perform them vicariously, made\r\nprophecies on the way home from church as to how soon the wedding would\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nPeople go to church to watch and pray, but a man I know says that women\r\ngo to church to watch. Young clergymen fall an easy prey to designing\r\nwidows, he avers. I can discover no proof, however, that the Widow\r\nNewton made any original designs; she was below the young clergyman in\r\nsocial standing, and when the good man began to pay special attentions\r\nto her baby boy she never imagined that the sundry pats and caresses\r\nwere meant for her.\r\n\r\nLittle Isaac Newton was just three years old when the wedding occurred,\r\nand was not troubled about it. The bride went to live with her husband\r\nat the rectory, a mile away, and the little boy in dresses, with long\r\nyellow curls, was taken to the home of his grandmother. The Reverend\r\nBarnabas Smith didn't like babies as well as he had at first thought.\r\nGrandparents are inclined to be lax in their discipline. And anyway it\r\nis no particular difference if they are: a scarcity of discipline is\r\nbetter than too much. More boys have been ruined by the rod than saved\r\nby it--love is a good substitute for a cat-'o-nine-tails.\r\n\r\nThere were several children born to the Reverend Barnabas Smith and his\r\nwife, and all were disciplined for their own good. Isaac, a few miles\r\naway, snuggled in the arms of his old grandmother when he was bad and\r\nwent scot-free.\r\n\r\nMany years after, Sir Isaac Newton, in an address on education at\r\nCambridge, playfully referred to the fact that in his boyhood he did not\r\nhave to prevaricate to escape punishment, his grandmother being always\r\nwilling to lie for him. His grandmother was his first teacher and his\r\nbest friend as long as she lived.\r\n\r\nWhen he was twelve years old he was sent to the village school at\r\nGrantham, eight miles away. There he boarded with a family by the name\r\nof Clark, and at odd times helped in the apothecary-shop of Mr. Clark,\r\ncleaning bottles and making pills. He himself has told us that the\r\nworking with mortar and pestle, cutting the pills in exact cubes, and\r\nthen rolling one in each hand between thumb and finger, did him a lot of\r\ngood, whether the patients were benefited or not.\r\n\r\nThe genial apothecary also explained that pills were for those who made\r\nand sold them, and that if they did no harm to those who swallowed them,\r\nthe whole transaction was then one of benefit. All of which proves to us\r\nthat men had the essence of wisdom two hundred years ago, quite as much\r\nas now.\r\n\r\nThe master of the school at Grantham was one Mr. Stokes, a man of\r\ngenuine insight and tact--two things rather rare in the pedagogic\r\nequipment at that time. The Newton boy was small and stood low in his\r\nclass, perhaps because book-learning had not been the bent of his\r\ngrandmother. The fact that Isaac was neither strong nor smart, nor even\r\nsmartly dressed, caused him to serve in the capacity of a butt for the\r\nbullies.\r\n\r\nOne big boy in particular made it his business to punch, kick and cuff\r\nhim on all occasions, in class or out. This continued for a month, when\r\none day the little boy invited the big one out into the churchyard and\r\nthere fell upon him tooth and claw. The big boy had strength, but the\r\nlittle one had right on his side.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster looked over the wall and shouted, \"Thrice armed is he\r\nwho knows his cause is just!\" In two minutes the bully was beaten, but\r\nthe schoolmaster's son, who stood by as master of ceremonies, suggested\r\nthat the big boy have his nose rubbed against the wall of the church for\r\nluck. This was accordingly done, not o'er-gently, and when Isaac\r\nreturned to the schoolroom, the master, who was supposed to know nothing\r\nofficially of the fighting, prophesied, \"Young Mr. Newton will yet beat\r\nany boy in this school in his studies.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that this prophecy was made after its fulfilment,\r\nbut even so, we know that Mr. Stokes lived long enough to take great\r\npride in the Newton boy, and to grow reminiscent concerning his great\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\nOur hearts surely go out to the late Mr. Stokes, schoolmaster at\r\nGrantham.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is surely something in that old idea of Indians that when they\r\nkilled an enemy the strength of the fallen adversary entered into\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThis encounter of little Isaac with the school bully was a pivotal point\r\nin his career. He had vanquished the rogue physically, and he now set to\r\nwork to do as much mentally for the whole school. He had it in him--it\r\nwas just a matter of application.\r\n\r\nOnce, in after-life, in speaking of those who had benefited him most, he\r\nplaced this unnamed chucklehead first, and added with a smile, \"Our\r\nenemies are quite as necessary to us as our friends.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few months Isaac stood at the head of the class. In mathematics he\r\nespecially excelled, and the Master, who prided himself on being able to\r\ngive problems no one could solve but himself, found that he was put to\r\nthe strait of giving a problem nobody could solve. He was somewhat taken\r\naback when little Isaac declined to work on it, and coolly pointed out\r\nthe fallacy involved. The only thing for the teacher to do was to say he\r\nhad purposely given the proposition to see if any one would detect the\r\nfallacy. This he gracefully did, and again made a prophecy to the effect\r\nthat Isaac Newton would some day take his own place and be master of\r\nGrantham School.\r\n\r\nIn the year Sixteen Hundred Fifty-six the schooldays of Isaac Newton\r\nwere cut short by the death of his stepfather.\r\n\r\nHis mother, twice a widow, moved back to \"Woolsthorpe,\" a big name for a\r\nvery small estate. Isaac was made the man of the house. The ambition of\r\nhis mother was that he should become a farmer and stock-raiser.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the boy entered upon his farm duties with an alacrity that\r\nwas not to last. His heart was not in the work, but the desire to please\r\nhis mother spurred him forward.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, being sent with a load of produce to Grantham, he\r\nstopped to visit his old school, and during his call struck a bargain\r\nwith one of the boys for a copy of Descartes' Geometry. The purchase\r\nexhausted his finances, so that he was unable to buy the articles his\r\nmother had sent him for, but when he got home he explained that one\r\nmight get along without such luxuries as clothing, but a good Geometry\r\nwas a family necessity. About this time he made a water-clock, and also\r\nthat sundial which can be seen today, carved into the stone on the\r\ncorner of the house. He still continued his making of kites which had\r\nbeen begun at Grantham; and gave the superstitious neighbors a thrill by\r\nflying kites at night with lighted lanterns made from paper, attached to\r\nthe tails. He made water-wheels and windmills, and once constructed a\r\nminiature mill that he ran by placing a mouse in a treadmill inside.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the cows got into the corn, and the weeds in the garden\r\nimproved each shining hour. The fond mother was now sorely disappointed\r\nin her boy, and made remarks to the effect that if she had looked after\r\nhis bringing up instead of entrusting him to an indulgent grandmother,\r\naffairs at this time would not be in their present state. Parents are\r\napt to be fussy: they can not wait.\r\n\r\nMatters reached a climax when the sheep that Isaac had been sent to\r\nwatch, overran the garden and demolished everything but the purslane and\r\nragweed, while all the time the young man was under the hedge working\r\nout mathematical problems from his Descartes.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the mother called in her brother, the Reverend Mr.\r\nAyscough, and he advised that a boy who was so bound to study should be\r\nallowed to study.\r\n\r\nAnd the good man offered to pay the wages of a man to take Isaac's place\r\non the farm.\r\n\r\nSo, greatly to the surprise and pleasure of Mr. Stokes of Grantham,\r\nIsaac one fine day returned with his books, just as if he had only been\r\ngone a day instead of a year.\r\n\r\nAt the home of the apothecary the lad was thrice welcome. He had\r\nendeared himself to the women of the household especially. He did not\r\nplay with other boys--their games and sports were absolutely outside of\r\nhis orbit. He was silent and so self-contained that he won from his\r\nschoolfellows the sobriquet of \"Old Coldfeet.\" Nothing surprised him; he\r\nnever lost his temper; he laughed so seldom that the incident was noted\r\nand told to the neighbors; his attitude was one of abstraction, and when\r\nhe spoke it was like a judge charging a jury with soda-water.\r\n\r\nAll his spare time was given up to whittling, pounding, sawing, and\r\nmaking mathematical calculations.\r\n\r\nNot all of his inventions were toys, for among other things he\r\nconstructed a horseless carriage which was run by a crank and pumping\r\ndevice, by the occupants.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the horseless carriage is a matter that has long been in the\r\nminds of inventors.\r\n\r\nSeveral men, supremely great, have tried their hands and head at it.\r\nLeibnitz worked at it; Swedenborg prophesied the automobile, and made a\r\ncarriage, placing the horse inside, and did not give up the scheme until\r\nthe horse ran away with himself and demolished a year's work. The\r\ngovernment here interfered and placed an injunction against \"the making\r\nof any more such diabolical contrivances for the disturbance of the\r\npublic peace.\" All of which makes us believe that if either Edison or\r\nMarconi had lived two hundred years ago, the bailiffs would have looked\r\nafter them with the butt end of the law for the regulation of wizards\r\nand witches--wizards at Menlo Park being as bad as witches at Salem.\r\n\r\nNewton's horseless carriage later came to grief in a similar way to\r\nSwedenborg's invention--it worked so well and so fast that it turned a\r\ncomplete somersault into a ditch, and its manipulation was declared to\r\nbe a pastime more dangerous than football.\r\n\r\nNot all the things produced by Isaac about this time were failures. For\r\ninstance, among other things he made a table, a chair and a cupboard for\r\na young woman who was a fellow-boarder at the apothecary's. The\r\nexcellence of young Newton's handiwork was shown in that the articles\r\njust mentioned outlasted both owner and maker.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMuch of the reminiscence concerning the Grantham days of Sir Isaac\r\nNewton comes from the fortunate owner of that historic old table, chair\r\nand cupboard. This was Mary Story, who was later Mrs. Vincent.\r\n\r\nMiss Story was the same age as Isaac. She was just eighteen when the\r\nfurniture was made roycroftie--she was a young lady, grown, and wore a\r\ndress with a train; moreover, she had been to London and had been\r\ncourted by a widower, while Isaac Newton was only a lad in roundabouts.\r\n\r\nAge counts for little--it is experience and temperament that weigh in\r\nthe scale. Isaac was only a little boy, and Mary Story treated him like\r\none. And here seems a good place to quote what Doctor Charcot said, \"In\r\narranging the formula for a great man, make sure you delay adolescence:\r\nrareripes rot early.\"\r\n\r\nIsaac and Mary became very good chums, and used to ramble the woods\r\ntogether hand in hand, in a way that must have frightened them both had\r\nthey been on the same psychic plane. Isaac had about the same regard for\r\nher that he might have had for a dear maiden aunt who would mend his old\r\nsocks and listen patiently, pretending to be interested when he talked\r\nof parallelograms and prismatic spectra. But evidently Mary Story\r\nthought of him with a thrill, for she stoutly resented the boys calling\r\nhim \"Coldfeet.\"\r\n\r\nIn due time Isaac gravitated to Cambridge. Mary mooed a wee, but soon\r\nconsoled herself with a sure-enough lover, and was married to Mr.\r\nVincent, a worthy man and true, but one who had not sufficient\r\nsoul-caloric to make her forget her Isaac.\r\n\r\nThis friendship with Mary Story is often spoken of as the one\r\nlove-affair in the life of Sir Isaac Newton. It was all prosily Platonic\r\non his part, but as Mary lived out her life at Grantham, and Sir Isaac\r\nNewton used to go there occasionally, and when he did, always called\r\nupon her, the relationship was certainly noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe only break in that lifelong friendship occurred when each was past\r\nfifty.\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton was paying his little yearly call at Grantham; and was\r\nseated in a rustic arbor by the side of Mrs. Vincent, now grown gray,\r\nand the mother of a goodly brood, well grown up. As they thus sat\r\ntalking of days agone, his thoughts wandered off upon quadratic\r\nequations, and to aid his mind in following the thread, he\r\nabsent-mindedly lighted his pipe, and smoked in silence. As the tobacco\r\ndied low, he gazed about for a convenient utensil to use in pushing the\r\nashes down in the bowl of his pipe. Looking down he saw the lady's hand\r\nresting upon his knee, and he straightway utilized the forefinger of his\r\nvis-a-vis. A suppressed feminine screech followed, but the fires of\r\nfriendship were not quenched by so slight an incident, which Mrs.\r\nVincent knew grew out of temperament, and not from wrong intent.\r\n\r\nShe lived to be eighty-five, and to the day of her death caressed the\r\nscar--the cicatrice of a love-wound. All of which seems to prove that\r\nold women can be quite as absurd as young ones--goodness me!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Isaac was eighteen, Master Stokes was so well impressed with his\r\nstar scholar that he called in the young lad's uncle, the Reverend Mr.\r\nAyscough, and insisted that the boy be sent to Cambridge. The uncle\r\nbeing a Cambridge man himself thought this the proper thing to do.\r\n\r\nOn June Fifth, Sixteen Hundred Sixty-one, Isaac presented his\r\ncredentials from his uncle and Mr. Stokes, and was duly entered in\r\nTrinity College as a subsizar, which means that he was admitted on\r\nsuspicion. A part of the duties of a subsizar was to clean boots, scrub\r\nfloors and perform various other delightful tasks which everybody else\r\nevaded.\r\n\r\nTo be at Trinity College in any capacity was paradise for this boy. He\r\nthirsted for knowledge: to know, to do, to perform--these things were\r\nhis desire. He had been brought up to work, anyway, and to a country boy\r\ntoil is no punishment. \"I knew that if worse came to worst I could get\r\nwork in the town making furniture and earn a man's wage,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIn a month he had passed his first examinations and was made a sizar.\r\nBefore this he had been fag to everybody, but now he was fag to the\r\nSeniors only. He not only made their beds and cleaned their rooms, but\r\nalso worked their examples in mathematics, and thus commanded their\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nOnce, being called upon in class to recite from Euclid, he declined and\r\nshocked the professor by saying, \"It is a trifling book--I have\r\nmastered it and thrown it aside.\" And it was no idle boast--he knew the\r\nbook as the professor did not. When he arrived at Cambridge, he carried\r\nin his box a copy of Sanderson's Logic presented to him by his\r\nuncle--the uncle having no use for it. It happened to be one of the\r\ntextbooks in use at Trinity. When Isaac heard lectures on Sanderson he\r\nfound he knew the book a deal better than the tutor, a thing the tutor\r\nshortly acknowledged before the class. This caused young Mr. Newton to\r\nstand out as a prodigy. Usually students have to rap for admittance to\r\nthe higher classes, but now the teachers came and sought him out. One\r\nprofessor told him he was about to take up Kepler's Optics with some\r\npost-graduate students--would young Mr. Newton come in? Isaac begged to\r\nbe excused until he could examine the book. The volume was loaned to\r\nhim. He tore the vitals out of it and digested them. When the lectures\r\nbegan, he declined to go because he had mastered the subject as far as\r\nKepler carried it.\r\n\r\nGenius seems to consist in the ability to concentrate your rays and\r\nfocus them on one point. Isaac Newton could do it. \"On a Winter day I\r\ntook a small glass and so centered the sun's rays that I burned a hole\r\nin my coat,\" he wrote in his subsizar journal.\r\n\r\nThe youth possessed an imperturbable coolness: he talked little, but\r\nwhen he spoke it was very frankly and honestly. From any other his words\r\nwould have had a presumptuous and boastful sound. As it was he was\r\nrespected and beloved. At Cambridge his face and features commended him:\r\nhe looked like another Cambridge man, one Milton--John Milton--only his\r\nface was a little more stern in its expression than that of the author\r\nof \"Paradise Lost.\"\r\n\r\nIn two years' time Isaac Newton was a scholar of whom all Cambridge\r\nknew. He had prepared able essays on the squaring of curved and crooked\r\nlines, on errors in grinding lenses and the methods of rectifying them,\r\nand in the extraction of roots where the cubes were imperfect: he had\r\ndone things never before attempted by his teachers. When they called\r\nupon him to recite, it was only for the purpose of explaining truths\r\nwhich they had not mastered.\r\n\r\nIn Sixteen Hundred Sixty-four, being in his twenty-second year, Isaac\r\nNewton was voted a free scholarship, which provided for board, books and\r\ntuition. On this occasion he was examined in Euclid by Doctor Barrow,\r\nthe Head Master of Trinity.\r\n\r\nNewton could solve every problem, but could not explain why or how. His\r\nmethods were empirical--those of his own.\r\n\r\nMany men with a modicum of mathematical genius work in this way, and in\r\npractical life the plan may serve all right. But now it was shown to\r\nNewton that a schoolman must not only know how to work out great\r\nproblems, but also why he goes at it in a certain way; otherwise,\r\ncolleges are vain--we must be able to pass our knowledge along. The\r\nreally great man is one who knows the rules and then forgets them, just\r\nas the painter of supreme merit must be a realist before he evolves into\r\nan impressionist.\r\n\r\nNewton now acknowledged his mistake in reference to Euclid, and set to\r\nwork to master the rules. This graciousness in accepting advice, and the\r\nwillingness to admit his lapse, if he had been hasty, won for him not\r\nonly the scholarship, but also the love of his superiors. Milton was a\r\nradical who made enemies, but Newton was a radical who made friends. He\r\navoided iconoclasm, left all matters of theology to the specialists, and\r\naccepted the Church as a necessary part of society. His care not to\r\noffend fixed his place in Cambridge for life.\r\n\r\nIt was Cambridge that fostered and encouraged his first budding\r\nexperiments; it was there he was sustained in his mightiest hazards; and\r\nit was within her walls that the ripe fruit of his genius was garnered\r\nand gathered. When his fame had become national and he was called to\r\nhigher offices than Cambridge supplied, Cambridge watched his career\r\nwith the loving interest of a mother, and the debt of love he fully\r\npaid, for it was very largely through his name and fame that Cambridge\r\nfirst took her place as one of the great schools of the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNewton took his degree of Bachelor of Arts at Cambridge, in January, in\r\nthe year Sixteen Hundred Sixty-five. The faculty of Trinity would not\r\neven consider his leaving the college: he was as valuable to them as he\r\nwould be now if he were a famous football-player. Besides the\r\nscholarship, there were ways provided so he could earn money by private\r\ntutoring and giving lectures in the absence of the professors.\r\n\r\nHe had written his essay on fluxions, described their application to\r\nfluents and tangents, and devised a plan for finding the radius of\r\ncurvity in crooked lines. In August of the same year that Newton was\r\ngiven his degree, the college was dismissed on account of an epidemic,\r\nand Newton went home to Woolsthorpe to kill time. In September, Sixteen\r\nHundred Sixty-five, he then being twenty-three, while seated in his\r\nmother's garden, Newton saw that storied apple fall. What pulled it\r\ndown? Some force tugging at it, surely!\r\n\r\nGalileo had experimented with falling bodies, and had proved that the\r\nweight and size of a falling body had nothing to do with its velocity,\r\nsave as its size and shape might be affected by the friction of the\r\natmosphere. The first person to put into print the story of the falling\r\napple was Voltaire, whose sketch of Newton is a little classic which the\r\nworld could ill afford to lose. Adam, William Tell and Isaac Newton each\r\nhad his little affair with an apple, but with different results.\r\n\r\nThe falling apple suggested to Newton that there was some power in the\r\nground that was constantly pulling things toward the center of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThis power extended straight down into the earth--he knew it--he had\r\ndropped a stone into a mine, and had also dropped things from steeples.\r\nHe dropped apples from kites by an ingenious device of two strings, and\r\nhe concluded that an apple taken a hundred miles up in the air would\r\nreturn to earth.\r\n\r\nHe then began to speculate as to just what a body would do a thousand or\r\nten thousand miles from the earth. So high as we could go, or as deep as\r\nwe could dig, this drawing power was always present. The Law of\r\nGravitation!\r\n\r\nIf a cannon-ball was fired in a straight line at a distant target, the\r\ngunner had to elevate the aim if he would hit the target, for the ball\r\ndescribed a curve and would keep dropping to the earth until it struck\r\nthe ground. Something was pulling it down: what was it? The Law of\r\nGravitation!\r\n\r\nThe moon was attracted toward us and would surely fall into us, but for\r\nthe fact that there were other attractions drawing her toward them. The\r\nmovements of the planets were owing to the fact that they were obeying\r\nattractions. They were moving in curves, just like cannon-balls in\r\nmotion. They had two movements, also, like the cannon-ball.\r\n\r\nNewton had noticed that the stars within a certain territory all moved\r\nin similar directions, and so must be acted upon by the same influences.\r\nThe Law of Gravitation!\r\n\r\nIt is held by many people in East Aurora and elsewhere that Newton's\r\ninvention is a devilish device originated for the benefit of surgeons\r\nand crockery-dealers. But this is not wholly true.\r\n\r\nWithout this Law of Gravitation the Earth could not retain her spherical\r\nshape: only through this constant drawing in toward the center could she\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nThe other planets, too, must be round or they could not exist, and so\r\nthey also had this same quality of gravity in common with the Earth--a\r\ndrawing in of everything toward the center. Here was clearly a positive\r\ndiscovery--this similarity of the heavenly bodies!\r\n\r\nEvery one of the heavenly bodies was exerting a constant attraction\r\ntoward all other heavenly bodies, and this attractive power must be in\r\nproportion to the distance they were from the object acted upon. Thus\r\nwere their movements and orbits accounted for.\r\n\r\nAt this time Newton was perfectly familiar with Kepler's Law, that the\r\nsquares of the periodic times of a planet were as the cubes of its\r\ndistance from the sun. And from this, he inferred that the attraction\r\nvaried as the square of the planet's distance from the sun.\r\n\r\nHere he was working on territory that had never been surveyed. At\r\nfirst, in his exuberance, he thought to figure out the size and weight\r\nof each planet quickly by measuring its attractive power. He did not\r\nrealize that he had cut out for himself work that would require many men\r\nand several centuries to cover, but surely he was on the right scent--a\r\nfinite man keen upon the secrets of the Infinite!\r\n\r\nHe was still at his mother's old home in the country, without scientific\r\napparatus or the stimulus of colleagues, when we find by a record in his\r\njournal that antique groan because there were only twenty-four hours in\r\na day, and that eight were required for sleep and eight more for\r\nrecreation!\r\n\r\nA subject a little nearer home than planetary attraction had now\r\nswitched him off from measuring and weighing the stars. He was hard at\r\nwork in his mother's little sitting-room, with the windows darkened,\r\nmuch to that good woman's perplexity.\r\n\r\nBy shutting out all light from the windows and allowing the sun's rays\r\nto enter by a little, circular aperture, he had gotten the sunlight\r\ncaptured and tamed where he could study it. This ray of light he\r\nexamined with a small hand-glass he himself had made. In looking at the\r\nray, quite accidentally, he found it could be deflected and sent off at\r\nwill in various directions. When thrown on the wall, instead of being\r\nsimply white light it had seven distinct colors beginning with violet\r\nand running down to red. So white light was not a single element: it\r\nwas made up of various rays which had to be united in order to give us\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nEureka! He had found the secret of the rainbow--the sun's rays broken up\r\nand separated by the refracting agency of clouds!\r\n\r\nWell does Darwin declare that the separation of sunlight into its\r\ncomponent parts, and the invention of the spectrum, have marked an\r\nadvance in man's achievement such as the world had not seen since the\r\ntime of wonder-working Archimedes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Cambridge University was closed until October, year of Sixteen\r\nHundred Sixty-seven. Most of the intervening time Newton spent at the\r\nhome of his mother, but from accounts of his we can see that the College\r\npeople kept their eagle-eye upon him, for they sent remittances to him\r\nregularly for \"commons.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Cambridge he was assigned to the \"spiritual\r\nchamber,\" which was a room next to the chapel, that had formerly been\r\nreserved as a guest-room for visiting dignitaries.\r\n\r\nIn March, Sixteen Hundred Sixty-eight, he was given the degree of Master\r\nof Arts. His studies now were of a very varied kind. He was required to\r\ngive one lecture a week on any subject of his own choosing. Needless to\r\nsay his themes were all mathematical or scientific. Just what they were\r\ncan best be inferred by consulting his cashbook, since the lectures\r\nthemselves were not written out and all memoranda concerning them have\r\ndisappeared. This account-book shows that his expenditures were for a\r\nGunter's Book (he who invented the Gunter's Chain), a magnet and a\r\ncompass, glue, bulbs, putty, antimony, vinegar, white lead, salts of\r\ntartar, and lenses.\r\n\r\nAnd in addition there are a few interesting items such as one sees in\r\nthe Diary of George Washington: \"Lost at cards, five shillings.\"\r\n\"Treating at tavern, ten shillings.\" \"Binding my Bible, three\r\nshillings.\" \"Spent on my cousin, one pound, two.\" \"Expenses for wetting\r\nmy degree, sixteen shillings.\"\r\n\r\nThe last item shows that times have changed but little: this scientist\r\nand philosopher par excellence had to moisten his diploma at the tavern\r\nfor the benefit of good fellows who little guessed with whom they drank.\r\n\r\nHe also had \"poor relations\" come to visit him; and it is significant\r\nthat while there are various items showing where he lost money at cards,\r\nthere are no references to any money won at the same business, from\r\nwhich we infer that while there was no one at Cambridge who could follow\r\nhim in his studies, there yet were those who could deal themselves\r\nbetter hands when it came to the pasteboards.\r\n\r\nEvidently he got discouraged at playing cards, for after the year\r\nSixteen Hundred Sixty-eight, there are no more items of \"treating at the\r\ntavern\" or \"lost at cards.\" The boys had tried to educate him, but had\r\nnot succeeded. In card exploitations he fell a victim of arrested\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nI suppose it will not cause any one a shock to be told that \"the\r\ngreatest thinker of all time\" was not exactly a perfect man.\r\n\r\nSo let the truth be known that throughout his life Newton had a\r\nwell-defined strain of superstitious belief running through his\r\ncharacter. He never quite relinquished the idea of transmutation of\r\nmetals, and at times astrology was quite as interesting to him as\r\nastronomy.\r\n\r\nIn writing to a friend who was about to pay a long visit to the mines of\r\nHungary, he says, \"Examine most carefully and ascertain just how and\r\nunder what conditions Nature transforms iron into copper and copper into\r\nsilver and gold.\"\r\n\r\nIn his laboratory he had specimens of iron ore that contained copper,\r\nand also samples of copper ore that contained gold, and from this he\r\nargued that these metals were transmutable, and really in the act of\r\ntransmutation when the process was interfered with by the miner's pick.\r\n\r\nHe had transformed a liquid into a mass of solid crystals instantly, and\r\nall of the changes possible in light, which he had discovered, had\r\nenlarged his faith to a point where he declared, \"Nothing is\r\nimpossible.\"\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat curious that Isaac Newton, who had no soft sex-sentiment\r\nin his nature, quite unlike Galileo, still believed in alchemy and\r\nastrology, while Galileo's cold intellect at once perceived the fallacy\r\nof these things.\r\n\r\nGalileo also saw at once that for the sun to stand still at Joshua's\r\ncommand would really mean that the Earth must cease her motion, since\r\nthe object desired was to prolong the day. Sir Isaac Newton, who\r\ndiscovered the Law of Gravitation, yet believed that at the command of a\r\nbarbaric chieftain, this Law was arrested, and that all planetary\r\nattraction was made to cease while he fought the Philistines for the\r\npossession of pasture-land to which he had no title.\r\n\r\nGalileo did not know as much as Newton about planetary attraction, but\r\nvery early in his career he perceived that the Bible was not a book that\r\ncould be relied upon technically.\r\n\r\nWith Newton the Bible presented no difficulties. He regularly attended\r\nchurch and took part in the ritual. Religion was one thing and his daily\r\nwork another. He kept his religion as completely separate from his life\r\nas did Gladstone, who believed the Mosaic account of Creation was\r\nliterally true, and yet had a clear, cool, calculating head for facts.\r\n\r\nThe greatest financial exploiter in America today is an Orthodox\r\nChristian, taking an active part in missionary work and the spread of\r\nthe Gospel.\r\n\r\nIn his family he is gentle, kind and tender; he is a good neighbor, a\r\npunctilious churchgoer, a leader in Sunday-School, and a considerate\r\nteacher of little children.\r\n\r\nIn business relations he is as conscienceless as Tamerlane, who built a\r\nmountain of skulls as a monument to himself. He is cold, calculating,\r\nand if opposed, vindictive. On occasion he is absolutely without heart:\r\ncompassion, mercy or generosity are not then in his make-up.\r\n\r\nThe best lawyers procurable are paid princely sums to study for him the\r\npenal code, and legislatures have even revised it for his benefit.\r\nEviction, destruction, suicide and insanity have even trod in his train.\r\nA picture of him makes you think of that dark and gloomy canvas where\r\nCæsar, Alexander and Napoleon ride slowly side by side through a sea of\r\nstiffened corpses. Bribery, coercion, violence and even murder have been\r\nthis man's weapons. He is the richest man in America. And yet, as I said\r\nin the beginning, all this represents only one side of his nature: he\r\nreads his chapter in the Bible each evening by his family fireside, and\r\ntenderly kisses his grandchildren good-night.\r\n\r\nThe individual who imagines that embezzlers are all riotous in nature,\r\nand by habit are spendthrifts, does not know humanity. The embezzler is\r\none man; the model citizen another, and yet both souls reside in the one\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nNero had a passion for pet pigeons, and the birds used to come at his\r\ncall, perch on his shoulder and take dainty crumbs from his lips.\r\n\r\nThe natures of some men are divided up into water-tight compartments.\r\nSir Isaac Newton kept his religion in one compartment, and his science\r\nin another--they never got together.\r\n\r\nVoltaire has said, \"When Sir Isaac Newton discovered the Law of\r\nGravitation he excited the envy of the learned men of the world; but\r\nthey more than got even with him when he wrote a book on the prophecies\r\nof the Bible.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Newton was only twenty-seven years old he was elected the Lucasian\r\nProfessor of Mathematics at Trinity, an office that carried with it a\r\ngoodly salary and also very much honor. Never before had so young a man\r\nheld this chair.\r\n\r\nNewton was a pioneer in announcing the physical properties of light.\r\n\r\nEvery village photographer now fully understands this, but when Newton\r\nfirst proclaimed it he created a whirlwind of disapproval.\r\n\r\nWhen a man at that time put forth an unusual thought, it was regarded as\r\na challenge. Teachers and professors all over Great Britain, and also in\r\nGermany and France, at once set about to show the fallacy of Newton's\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nNewton had issued a pamphlet with diagrams showing how to study light,\r\nand the apparatus was so simple and cheap that the \"Newton experiments\"\r\nwere tried everywhere in schoolrooms.\r\n\r\nPeople always combat a new idea when first presented, and so Newton\r\nfound himself overwhelmed with correspondence.\r\n\r\nCheap arguments were fired into Cambridge in volleys. These were backed\r\nup by quibbling men--Pro Bono Publico, Veritas and Old Subscriber--men\r\nincapable of following Newton's scientific mind. In his great\r\ngood-nature and patience Newton replied to his opponents at length.\r\n\r\nHis explanations were construed into proof that he was not sure of his\r\nground. One man challenged him to debate the matter publicly, and we\r\nhear of his going up to London, king that he was, to argue with a\r\ncommoner.\r\n\r\nSuch terms as \"falsifier,\" \"upstart,\" \"pretender,\" were freely used, and\r\npoor Newton for a time was almost in despair.\r\n\r\nHe had thought that the world was anxious for truth! Some of his\r\nfellow-professors now touched their foreheads and shook their heads\r\nominously as he passed. He had gone so far beyond them that the cries of\r\n\"whoa!\" were unnoticed.\r\n\r\nIt is here worth noting that the universal fame of Sir Isaac Newton was\r\nbrought about by his rancorous enemies, and not by his loving friends.\r\nGentle, honest, simple and direct as was his nature, he experienced\r\nnotoriety before he knew fame.\r\n\r\nTo the world at large he was a \"wizard\" and a \"juggler\" before he was\r\nacknowledged a teacher of truth--a man of science.\r\n\r\nWhen the dust of conflict concerning Newton's announcement of the\r\nqualities of light had somewhat subsided, he turned to his former\r\ndiscovery, the Law of Gravitation, and bent his mighty mind upon it. The\r\ninfluence of the moon upon the Earth, the tilt of the Earth, the\r\nflattening of the poles, the recurring tides, the size, weight and\r\ndistance of the planets, now occupied Newton's attention. And to study\r\nthese phenomena properly, he had to construct special and peculiar\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nIn Sixteen Hundred Eighty-seven the results of his discoveries were\r\nbrought together in one great book, the \"Principia.\" Newton was\r\nforty-five years old then.\r\n\r\nHe was still the Cambridge professor, but was well known in political\r\ncircles in London on account of having been sent there at various times\r\nto represent the University in a legal way.\r\n\r\nHis diplomatic success led to his being elected a member of Parliament.\r\nAmong other great men whom he met in London was Samuel Pepys, who kept a\r\ndiary and therein recorded various important nothings about \"Mr. Isaac\r\nNewton of Cambridge--a schoolteacher of degree, with a great dignity of\r\nmanner and pleasing Countenance.\" It seems Newton thought so well of\r\nPepys that he wrote him several letters, from which Samuel gives us\r\nquotations. Pepys really claimed the honor of introducing Newton into\r\ngood society.\r\n\r\nAmong others with whom Newton made friends in Parliament was Mr.\r\nMontague, who shortly afterward became Secretary of the Exchequer.\r\nMontague made his friend Newton a Warden of the Mint, with pay about\r\ndouble that which he had received while at Cambridge.\r\n\r\nIn this public work Newton brought such talent and diligence to bear\r\nthat in Sixteen Hundred Ninety-seven he was made Master of the Mint, at\r\na salary of fifteen hundred pounds a year--a princely sum in those days.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the fact that Newton was a devout Churchman and\r\nan upholder of the Established Order was a great, although perhaps\r\nunconscious, diplomatic move.\r\n\r\nHis delightful personality--gracious, suave, dignified and silent--won\r\nfor him admiration wherever he would go. In argument his fine reserve\r\nand excellent temper were most convincing. Had he turned his attention\r\nto the law he would have become Chief Justice of England.\r\n\r\nIn Seventeen Hundred Three he was elected President of the Royal\r\nSociety, an office he held continuously for twenty-five years, and which\r\ntenure was only terminated by his death.\r\n\r\nIn Seventeen Hundred Five the Queen visited Cambridge, and there with\r\nmuch pageantry bestowed the honor of Knighthood which changed Professor\r\nNewton into Sir Isaac Newton.\r\n\r\nBut the man himself was still the simple, modest gentleman. The title\r\ndid not spoil him--he was a noble man from boyhood.\r\n\r\nHis duties as Master of the Mint did not interfere with his studies and\r\nscientific investigations. He revised and rewrote his \"Principia,\" and\r\nin Seventeen Hundred Thirteen the new edition was issued. One copy was\r\nmost sumptuously bound, and Sir Isaac, who was a special favorite at\r\nCourt, presented it in person to the Queen. Those who are interested in\r\nsuch things may, by applying to the Curator of the British Museum, see\r\nand turn the leaves of this book, reading the gracious inscription of\r\nthe author, while a solemn man in brass buttons stands behind.\r\n\r\nNewton died March Twentieth, Seventeen Hundred Twenty-seven, at the age\r\nof eighty-five, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe verdict of humanity concerning Sir Isaac Newton has been summed up\r\nfor us thus by Laplace: \"His work was pre-eminent above all other\r\nproducts of the human intellect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GALILEO]\r\n\r\nGALILEO\r\n\r\n\r\n     I am inclined to believe that the intention of the Sacred\r\n     Scriptures is to give to mankind the information necessary for\r\n     their salvation.\r\n\r\n     But I do not hold it necessary to believe that the same God who has\r\n     endowed us with senses, with speech, with intellect, intended that\r\n     we should neglect the use of these, and seek by other means for\r\n     knowledge which these are sufficient to procure for us; especially\r\n     in a science like astronomy, of which so little notice is taken by\r\n     the Scriptures that none of the planets, except the sun and moon\r\n     and once or twice only Venus, by the name of Lucifer, are so much\r\n     as named at all.\r\n\r\n     This therefore being granted, methinks that in the discussion of\r\n     natural problems we ought not to begin at the authority of texts of\r\n     Scriptures but at sensible experiments and necessary\r\n     demonstrations.\r\n\r\n     --_Galileo_\r\n\r\n\r\nGALILEO\r\n\r\nWith the history of Galileo and Copernicus, there is connected a\r\nman of such stern and withal striking individuality that the story of\r\nthe rise and evolution of astronomy can not be told and this man's name\r\nleft out. Giordano Bruno was born in Fifteen Hundred Forty-eight. His\r\nparents were obscure people, and his childhood and early education are\r\nenveloped in mystery. Occasional passages in his writings refer to his\r\nsympathy for outcast children, and he quotes the saying of Jesus,\r\n\"Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of\r\nsuch is the Kingdom of Heaven.\" He then refers to himself as having been\r\na waif and robbed of the love that was his due, \"the lawful, legal\r\nheritage of every child, sent without its consent into a world of\r\nstruggle and strife, where only love makes existence possible.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently, the early life of Bruno was a symbol and shadow of what Fate\r\nheld in store for him.\r\n\r\nThe first authentic knowledge we have of Bruno was when he was\r\ntwenty-two years old. He was then a Dominican monk, and he is brought to\r\nour attention because he distinguished himself by incurring the\r\ndispleasure of his superiors. His particular offense was that he had\r\ndeclared, \"The infallibility of the Pope is only in matters spiritual,\r\nand does not apply to the science of material things.\"\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, these words of Bruno are almost identical with words\r\nrecently expressed by Cardinal Satolli.\r\n\r\nThe difference in their reception is owing to a mere matter of a few\r\nhundred years. Truth is a question of time and place. Bruno was banished\r\nfor his temerity, and Satolli wears the red hat. Verily, yesterday's\r\nheresy is today's orthodoxy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Church toward the teachings of Copernicus, after the\r\ndeath of the man, was one of patronizing pity.\r\n\r\nInstead of putting his great book, \"Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies,\"\r\non the \"Index,\" the wiser plan was adopted of paying no attention to it.\r\nOccasionally, however, the subject was broached by some incautious\r\nnovitiate, and then the custom was to treat the Copernican Theory as a\r\nmere hypothesis, and its author as a mental defective.\r\n\r\nBruno would not have it so. To him it was a very important matter\r\nwhether the sun revolved around the earth as the priests taught, or the\r\nearth revolved around the sun as set forth in the work of Copernicus. He\r\ncame to the conclusion that Copernicus was right, and said so.\r\n\r\nIt was ordered that he should cease lecturing on the subject of\r\nastronomy and apply himself to spiritual matters. He argued that he\r\nshould be allowed to think and speak what he pleased about the stars,\r\nsince the whole matter was one of opinion, and even the Pope did not\r\nknow, positively, the final facts of astronomy, and if the Copernican\r\nTheory was a hypothesis, so also was the Ptolemaic Theory held by the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Copernicus and Bruno were very different in\r\ntemperament: one was gentle, diplomatic, cautious; the other was\r\nheadstrong, firm and full of argument.\r\n\r\nBruno was given his choice: to cease the study of astronomy or to lay\r\naside the Dominican frock. The hardihood of the young man was seen in\r\nthat he unfrocked himself, thinking that once outside of the order he\r\nwas not responsible to a superior and could teach what he pleased, so\r\nlong as it was not \"heresy.\"\r\n\r\nHeresy is treason to the Church, but Bruno could not see how spiritual\r\ndogma could cover the facts of Physical Science, since new facts were\r\nconstantly being discovered, and the material universe could only be\r\nunderstood by being studied. He was too innocent to comprehend that a\r\nvast majority of the people believed that popes, cardinals and priests\r\nknew everything, and that when any branch of knowledge was questioned it\r\nplaced the priests in doubt. Certainly the Church has not opposed\r\nScience--she has only opposed heresy. But the curious fact is that\r\nadvancing Science has usually been to the Church heretical. When Bruno\r\nopposed anything that the priests taught, he opposed the Church. He was\r\nwarned to leave Rome--his life was in danger. He fled to Geneva, the\r\nhome of Calvin.\r\n\r\nHere he thought, surely, he could speak and write as he chose. But alas!\r\nProtestantism cared even less about Science than did the monks, and\r\n\"heresy\" to John Calvin was quite as serious a matter as it was to\r\nCalvin's competitor, the Pope of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants of Geneva gave Bruno scant attention; they had never\r\nheard of Copernicus, and the movements of the stars were as nothing to\r\nthem, since the world was soon to come to an end.\r\n\r\nThe learned men were even then making mathematical calculations, based\r\non the prophecies of the Old Testament, as to how soon the general\r\ndestruction would take place.\r\n\r\nBruno sought to argue them out of their childishness, with the result\r\nthat he got himself marked as an infidel and a dangerous man.\r\n\r\nFrom Geneva he went to Lyons, then to Paris, where his personality made\r\nitself felt, and he was given a hearing at the University. Here he\r\nremained for several years, when he went to England, arriving there in\r\nFifteen Hundred Eighty-four, the same year that a rustic by the name of\r\nWilliam Shakespeare, from Stratford, reached London. Whether they ever\r\nmet is doubtful.\r\n\r\nBruno spoke five languages, and his polite accomplishments afforded him\r\nan immediate entry into the best circles of society. He was entertained\r\nat the home of Sir Philip Sidney, and afterward carried on an extensive\r\ncorrespondence with this prince of gentlemen. Greville presented Bruno\r\nto Queen Elizabeth, who invited him to lecture at the Court on his\r\nfavorite theme.\r\n\r\nThis he did, and it is quite probable that the noble lords and ladies\r\nleft \"calls\" so they could be awakened when the lecture was over and\r\ncongratulate the speaker of the evening on his effort.\r\n\r\nAt Oxford there were disputations where Bruno's faultless Latin\r\nimpressed the pedants much more than did his argument, so they offered\r\nhim a position as Professor of Languages, but this he smilingly\r\ndeclined, excusing himself on the grounds that he had important business\r\non the Continent: and he had. Already they were collecting fagots for\r\nhis benefit.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Paris and began his lecturing on Science. His arguments\r\nhad convinced one person at least, and that was himself, that as the\r\nChurch knew nothing of Physical Science, why, possibly it stood in a\r\nlike position regarding spiritual truth. That is to say, the so-called\r\n\"sacred truths\" were mere assumptions piled up to satisfy the people,\r\nand the ignorance and superstition of the many marked high water for the\r\nteaching of the priests. The business of the Church was to satisfy the\r\npeople, and not enlighten them, for if the people became enlightened\r\nenough they would see that they did not need the Church, and then where\r\nwere the honors and the riches and the red hats!\r\n\r\nBruno cleared his mind of its cobwebs by expression, just as we all\r\ndo--that is what expression is for.\r\n\r\nThe people really dictate to the priests what they shall teach;\r\nmoreover, the people absolutely refuse to listen to anything in which\r\nthey do not believe, and decline to pay for preaching that is not done\r\nto their own dictation. The business, then, of the Church is to study\r\ncarefully the ignorance of the people and conform to it. On this one\r\nthing does its stability depend. Therefore it must, as a matter of\r\nself-preservation, suppress any chance intellect that is ahead of its\r\ntime, lest this man honeycomb the whole structure of churchly dogma.\r\n\r\nBruno said that, just as the world seemed to stand still and the stars\r\nmove around us, so did the Church seem to most people a fixed fact. But\r\nexactly the opposite was true; the Church moves as the people move, and\r\nunless men outside of the Church educate the people, or the people\r\neducate themselves, they will forever remain in darkness.\r\n\r\nBruno offered to debate the question publicly with the Bishop of Paris.\r\nThat worthy was no match for Bruno in point of oratory, but when we can\r\nnot answer a man's reasons, all is not lost, for we can at least call\r\nhim vile names, and this is often quite as effectual as logic.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop launched a fusillade of theological lyddite at Bruno,\r\ndeclaring that any Churchman who would so much as hold converse with\r\nsuch a wretch was disgraced forever, and that the propositions Bruno\r\nwished to argue were unthinkable to a self-respecting man. He declared\r\nthat it was only the mercy of God that kept the lightning from striking\r\nBruno dead as he wrote his heresies.\r\n\r\nMatters were getting strained, and the authorities, fearing\r\ninsurrection, acted upon the advice of the good Bishop and expelled\r\nBruno from France. He went to Wittenberg, in his innocence, intending to\r\ntack on the church-door there his theses. But Wittenberg had no use for\r\nBruno--he believed too much, or too little, Luther could not tell which.\r\n\r\nThe University of Zurich now offered to let the exile come there and\r\nteach what he wished. Thither he journeyed and there his restless mind\r\nseemed for the first time to find a home. His writings were slowly\r\nmaking head, and around him there clustered a goodly group of students\r\nwho believed in him and loved him.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this oasis in a troubled life, word came from some of\r\nthe old-time friends he had known in Rome. They were now in Venice, and\r\nwished to have him come there and lecture. Bruno thought that his little\r\nleaven was leavening the whole lump--he was not without ambition--he was\r\nflattered by the invitation. He accepted it and went to Venice.\r\n\r\nIt was simply a ruse to get the man within striking distance. Very soon\r\nafter his arrival in Venice he was arrested by agents of the Inquisition\r\nand secretly taken to Rome. He was lodged in a dungeon of the Castle\r\nSaint Angelo. Just what his experience was there we can not say--the\r\nhorrors of it all are not ours, for no friend of Bruno's was allowed to\r\napproach, and what he there wrote was destroyed.\r\n\r\nWe do know, however, that he was asked to recant, and we know he\r\nrefused. We also know that he repeated his heresies and hurled back\r\ninto the teeth of his accusers the invective they heaped upon him.\r\n\r\nBribery, persuasion, threat and torture were tried in turn, but all in\r\nvain, for Bruno would not swerve. Unlike Savonarola his quivering flesh\r\ncould not wring from his heart an apology.\r\n\r\nHe scorned the rack and thumbscrew, declaring they could not reach his\r\nsoul. He knew that death would be the end; he prayed for it, and even\r\nthought to hasten it by an aggravating manner and harshness of speech\r\ntoward his captors, seemingly quite unnecessary.\r\n\r\nFor seven long years he was in prison. He was burned alive on the\r\nSeventh of February, Sixteen Hundred, aged fifty-two.\r\n\r\nWhen bound to the stake he turned his face from the crucifix that was\r\nheld before him, and sought to kiss the fagots. His ashes were thrown to\r\nthe four winds. Thus perished Bruno.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the year Fifteen Hundred Sixty-four, Galileo Galilei was born;\r\nconsequently, he was thirty-six years old when Bruno was executed. He\r\nhad known Bruno, had attended many of his lectures, and had followed his\r\ncareer with interest; and while he agreed with him concerning the\r\nCopernican theory of the earth's revolution, he took exceptions to\r\nBruno's arbitrary ways of presenting the matter, and also to his\r\nscathing criticisms of theology. At this time Galileo could not see that\r\nthe extravagant words of Bruno were largely forced from him by the\r\nviolence of the opposition he had encountered. Galileo fully believed\r\nthat Bruno had been put to death for treason to the Church, and not on\r\naccount of his astronomical teachings.\r\n\r\nThese men had come up from totally different stations in life. Bruno was\r\na man of the people--a self-made man--who bore upon his person the marks\r\nof the hammer. Galileo was of noble blood, and traced an ancestry to a\r\nGonfalonier of Florence. From early infancy he had enjoyed association\r\nwith polite persons, and had sat on the knees of greatness.\r\n\r\nWhen eighteen he was graduated from the University of Pisa; and at that\r\nearly age his family and friends were comparing him, not without reason,\r\nto a Genius who had come out of Tuscany some years before, Leonardo da\r\nVinci.\r\n\r\nParents either exaggerate the talents of their children or else\r\nbelittle them. The woman who bore George Gordon called him \"that lame\r\nbrat\"; but we call him \"The Poet Byron.\"\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin ran away from home, and his family thought themselves\r\ndisgraced by his printed utterances. George Washington's mother, after\r\nbeing told that her son had been made Commander-in-Chief, laughed\r\nknowingly and said, \"They don't know him as well as I do!\" Voltaire's\r\nfather posted his son as irresponsible, tied up a legacy so \"the\r\nscapegrace could not waste it,\" invested good money in daily prayers to\r\nbe said for the scapegrace's salvation, and then died of a broken heart,\r\njust as play-actors do on the stage, only this man died sure enough.\r\nAlfred Tennyson at thirteen wrote a poem addressed to his grandfather;\r\nthe old gentleman gave him a guinea for it, and then wrote these words:\r\n\"This is the first and last penny you will ever receive for writing\r\npoetry.\" The father of Shelley misquoted Job, and said, \"Oh, to be\r\nbrought down to the grave in grief through the follies of an ungrateful\r\nchild!\" And Labouchere says that one of the four brothers of Shakespeare\r\nused to explain that he wasn't the play-actor who wrote \"Hamlet\" and\r\n\"Othello,\" lest, mayhap, his name should be smirched.\r\n\r\nGalileo's mother had that beautiful dream which I believe all good\r\nmothers have: that her son might be the savior of the world. As he grew\r\nto manhood, her faith in him did not relax.\r\n\r\nIn childhood Galileo showed great skill in invention. He made curious\r\ntoys with cogs and wheels and eccentrics; whittled out violins, and\r\ntransformed simple reeds into lutes, upon which he played music of his\r\nown composition. In fact, so great was his skill in music that at twenty\r\nthey wished to make him official organist and choirmaster of the\r\nCathedral. His personal taste, however, ran more to painting; for some\r\nmonths he worked at his canvases with an ardor too great to last long.\r\nIf ever a man was touched by the Spirit of the Renaissance, it was\r\nsurely young Galileo. The Archbishop of Pisa said, \"Upon him has fallen\r\nthe mantle of Michelangelo.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave lectures on Art, and taught Painting by actual example. One of\r\nhis pupils, and a great artist, Lodovico Cigoli, always maintained that\r\nit was to the inspiration and counsel of Galileo that he owed his\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThere are really only two things to see at Pisa: one is the Leaning\r\nTower, from which Galileo with his line and plummet made some of his\r\nmost interesting experiments; and the other is the Cathedral where the\r\nvisitor beholds the great bronze lamp that is suspended from the vaulted\r\nceiling. When he was about twenty-one, sitting in the silence of this\r\nchurch (which the passing years have only made more beautiful), he\r\nnoticed that there was a slight swinging motion to this lamp--it was\r\nnever still. Galileo set to work timing and measuring these\r\noscillations, and he found that they were always done in exact measure\r\nand in perfect rhythm. This led, some years later, to perfecting an\r\nastronomical clock for measuring movements of the stars. And from this\r\nwas originated the pendulum-clock, where before we had depended on\r\nsundials.\r\n\r\nThe endeavor of Galileo's parents had been to keep him ignorant of\r\nmathematics and practical life, that he might blossom forth as a saint\r\nwho would sing and play and make pictures like those of Leonardo, and\r\ncarve statues like Michelangelo, only better.\r\n\r\nBut parents plan, and Fate disposes.\r\n\r\nIn Fifteen Hundred Eighty-three, Ostilio Ricci, the famous\r\nmathematician, chanced to be in Pisa, on his way from Rome to Milan, and\r\ngave a lecture at the Court, on Geometry.\r\n\r\nGalileo was not interested in the theme, but he was in the speaker, and\r\nso he attended the lecture.\r\n\r\nThis action proved one of the pivotal points in his life.\r\n\r\n\"Whether other people really teach us anything, is a question,\" says\r\nStanley Hall; \"but they do sometimes give us impulses, and make us find\r\nout for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nRicci made Galileo find out for himself.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Archimedes from Plato. Geometry became a passion, and a\r\nvery wise man has told us that we never accomplish anything, either good\r\nor bad, without passion. Passion means one hundred pounds of steam on\r\nthe boiler, with love sitting on the safety-valve, when the blow-off is\r\nset for fifty.\r\n\r\nIt surely is risky business, I will admit; accidents will occur\r\noccasionally and explosions sometimes happen, but everything is risky,\r\neven life, since few get out of it alive.\r\n\r\nAnd so, to drop back to the original proposition, nothing great and\r\nsublime is ever done without passion.\r\n\r\nGalileo had his mechanical whooping-cough, musical mumps, artistic\r\nmeasles, and now the hectic flush of mathematics burned on his cheeks.\r\nHe talked and dreamed mathematics.\r\n\r\nEuclid was in the saddle.\r\n\r\nRicci became interested in the talented young scholar and remained\r\nlonger at Pisa than he had intended, that they might sit up all night\r\nand surprise the rising sun, discussing beauties of dimensions and the\r\nwonders of dynamics.\r\n\r\nTogether they went to Florence, where Ricci introduced his pupil as a\r\npedagogic sample of the goods, just as Booker Washington usually takes\r\nwith him on his travels a few ebony homo bricks as his specimens from\r\nTuskegee.\r\n\r\nThe beauty and the grace of Galileo's speech and presence put the\r\nabstract Ricci in the shadow. The right man can make anything\r\ninteresting, just as Dean Swift could write an entrancing essay with the\r\nbroomstick as a central theme. The man's the thing, Hamlet to the\r\ncontrary, notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nGalileo knew the Florentine heart, and so he gave lectures on a\r\nFlorentine: one Dante, who loved a girl named Beatrice.\r\n\r\nThe young Pisan drew diagrams of Dante's Inferno--and surely it was\r\nnobody's else. He gave its size, height, weight, and told how to reach\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe gave lectures on the Hydrostatic Balance and the Centers of Gravity,\r\nand then published them as serials.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines crowned him with bay and enthusiastically proclaimed\r\nhim, \"The Modern Archimedes.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPisa now put forth efforts to have her gifted son come home. There was\r\nalways rivalry between Pisa and Florence. Pisa could not afford to\r\nsupply Florence her men of genius--let her depend upon production from\r\nhome, or go without.\r\n\r\nGalileo became Professor of Mathematics at the University of Pisa, a\r\nlife position, or at least one he could hold during good behavior.\r\n\r\nOne of the time-honored dictums of the day was that falling bodies fell\r\nwith a velocity proportioned to their weight. The question was first\r\nthrashed out in the classroom; and after Galileo had slyly gotten all of\r\nthese scientific wiseacres to commit themselves, he invited them, with\r\ntheir students, to the Leaning Tower.\r\n\r\nThen he proved by ocular demonstrations that they were positively wrong.\r\n\r\nIt is very beautiful to teach Truth, but error should not be corrected\r\nwith too much eclat. If the love of Truth, alone, was the guiding\r\nimpulse of Galileo, he might have secretly explained his theory to one\r\nof the wiseacres, and this wiseacre could have casually demonstrated it,\r\nso all the rest could have said, \"That is what we always knew and\r\ntaught.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of this, Galileo compelled the entire faculty to back water and\r\ndine on fricasseed crow.\r\n\r\nThey got even by calling him \"a scientific bastardino,\" and at his next\r\nlecture he was roundly hissed. Soon after he was bluntly informed that\r\nhis office was to teach the young, and not to undo the old.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the way the troubles of Galileo began.\r\n\r\nHe might then have apologized, and slipped back into peace and obscurity\r\nand later been tucked in by kind oblivion. But he had tasted blood, and\r\nthe rabies of setting straight the scientific world, for its own good,\r\nwas upon him.\r\n\r\nThat he was wrong in the correction of his elders, he would not for a\r\nmoment admit; and he was even guilty of saying, \"Antiquity can not\r\nsanctify that which is wrong in reason and false in principle.\" Soon\r\nafter he committed another forepaugh by showing that a wonderful boat\r\ninvented by Giovanni de Medici for the purpose of fighting hostile\r\nships, would not work, since there were no men on board to guide it, and\r\nits automatic steering apparatus would as likely run its nose into land,\r\nas into the hull of the enemy.\r\n\r\nHe also decorated his argument with a few subtle touches as to the\r\nbeauty of fighting battles without going to war and risking life and\r\nlimb.\r\n\r\nMen who are not kind to the faults of royalty can hope for small favor\r\nin a monarchy, though the monarchy be a republic. Galileo was cut off\r\nthe Standard Oil payroll, and forced to apply to a teachers' agency,\r\nthat he might find employment.\r\n\r\nHe did not wait long; the rival University of Padua tendered him a\r\nposition on a silver platter; and the Paduans made much dole about how\r\nunfortunate it was that men could not teach Truth in Italy, save at\r\nPadua--alas! The Governing Board of Padua made a great stroke in\r\nsecuring Galileo, and Pisa fell back on her Leaning Tower as her chief\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\nFrom a position of mediocrity, the University of Padua gradually rose to\r\none of worldwide celebrity. Galileo remained at Padua from Fifteen\r\nHundred Ninety-two to Sixteen Hundred Ten, which years are famous not\r\nalone through the wonderful inventions of Galileo, but because in that\r\nsame interval of time, at least thirty of Shakespeare's thirty-seven\r\nplays were written. Surely, God was smiling on the planet Earth!\r\n\r\nGalileo's salary was raised every year, starting at two hundred florins,\r\nuntil it reached over one thousand florins, not to mention the numerous\r\ngifts from grateful pupils, old and young. Students came to Padua from\r\nall over the world to hear Galileo's lectures.\r\n\r\nStarting with only a common classroom, the audience increased so fast\r\nthat a special auditorium was required that would seat two thousand\r\npersons. It was during this time that Galileo invented the proportional\r\ncompasses, an instrument now in use everywhere, without the slightest\r\nchange having been made in it.\r\n\r\nHe also invented the thermometer; but greatest, best and most wonderful\r\nof all, he produced an instrument through which he could view the stars,\r\nand see them much magnified. With this instrument, he saw heavenly\r\nbodies that had never been seen before; he beheld that Jupiter had\r\nsatellites which moved in orbits, and that Venus revolved, showing\r\ndifferent sides at different times, thus proving that which Copernicus\r\ndeclared was true, but which, for lack of apparatus, he could not prove.\r\n\r\nGalileo Galilei was getting to be more than a professor of\r\nmathematics--he was becoming a power in the world.\r\n\r\nThe lever of his mighty mind was indeed finding a fulcrum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe year Sixteen Hundred Nine is forever fixed in history, through the\r\nfact that in that year Galileo invented the telescope.\r\n\r\nEvery good thing is an evolution. \"Specilla,\" or helps to read, had been\r\nmade, and sold privately and mysteriously, as early as the year Fourteen\r\nHundred. These first magnifying-glasses were associated with magic, or\r\nwonder-working; the words \"magnify\" and \"magic\" having a common source\r\nand a similar meaning. Magicians wore big square glasses, and by their\r\naid, some of them claimed to see things at a great distance; and also to\r\nperceive things stolen, hidden or lost. Occasionally, the magician would\r\npersuade his customer to try on the glasses, and then even common men\r\ncould see for themselves that there was something in the\r\nscheme--goodness me! The use of spectacles was at first confined\r\nentirely to these wonder-workers--or men who magnified things forever.\r\nDuring the Fifteenth Century, public readers and occasionally priests\r\nwore spectacles. To read was a miracle to most people, and a book was a\r\nmysterious and sacred thing--or else a diabolical thing. The populace\r\nwould watch the man put on his \"specillum,\" and the idea was everywhere\r\nabroad that the magic glasses gave an ability to read; and that anybody\r\nwho was inspired by angels, or devils, who could get hold of spectacles,\r\ncould at once read from a book.\r\n\r\nWe hear of one magician who, about the year Fifteen Hundred, made a box\r\nwith a glass cover that magnified the contents. This great man would\r\ncatch a flea and show it to the people. Then he would place the flea in\r\nthe box and show it to them, and they would see that it had grown\r\nenormously in an instant. The man could make it big or little, by just\r\ntaking off and putting on the cover of the box!\r\n\r\nThis individual worked wonders for a consideration, but Fate overtook\r\nhim and he was smothered under a feather bed for having too much wizard\r\nin his cosmos. A wizard, be it known, is a male witch, and the Bible\r\nsays, \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,\" although it does not say\r\nanything about wizards.\r\n\r\nBut please note this: the wizard who had that magic box and flea had\r\nreally the first microscope.\r\n\r\nGalileo bought a pair of \"magic glasses,\" or spectacles, about the year\r\nSixteen Hundred Seven; and his action, in so doing, was freely\r\ncriticized.\r\n\r\nOn a visit to Venice, where glass had been manufactured since long\r\nbefore the Flood, Galileo was looking through one of the\r\nglass-factories, just as visitors do now, and one of the workmen showed\r\nhim a peculiar piece of glass which magnified the hairs on the back of\r\nhis hand many times.\r\n\r\nIn a very few days after this, Galileo heard that a Dutch\r\nspectacle-maker had placed certain queer-shaped pieces of glass in a\r\ntube, and offered to sell this tube to the Government, so by its use,\r\nsoldiers could see the movements of an enemy many miles away.\r\n\r\nThat night Galileo did not close his eyes in sleep. He thought out a\r\nplan by which he could place pieces of glass in a tube, and bring the\r\nstars close to the earth. By daylight the whole plan was clear in his\r\nmind, and he hastened to the shop of the glassmakers.\r\n\r\nThere, two lenses were made, one plano-convex, and the other\r\nplano-concave, and these were placed in a tube made of sheet copper. It\r\nwas tested on distant objects; and behold! they were magnified by three.\r\nWould this tube show the stars magnified? Galileo knew of no reason why\r\nit should not, but he paced his room in hot impatience, waiting for the\r\nnight to come with its twinkling wonders, that he might verify his\r\nconvictions. When the first yellow star appeared in the West, Galileo\r\nturned his tube upon it, and behold! instead of twinkling points of\r\nlight, he saw a round mass--a world--moving through space, and not a\r\nscintillating object with five points. The twinkling spikes, or points,\r\nwere merely an optical illusion of the unaided senses.\r\n\r\nGalileo made no secret of his invention. It was called \"Galileo's Tube,\"\r\nbut some of the priests called it Galileo's \"Magic Tube.\"\r\n\r\nYet it marked an era in the scientific world. Galileo endeavored\r\nconstantly to improve his instrument; and from a threefold magnifying\r\npower, he finally made one that magnified thirty-two times.\r\n\r\nGalileo made hundreds of telescopes, and sold them at moderate prices to\r\nany one who would buy. He explained minutely the construction of the\r\ninstrument, showing clearly how it was made in accordance with the\r\nnatural laws of optics. His desire was to dissipate the superstition\r\nthat there was something diabolical or supernatural about the \"Magic\r\nTube\"--that, in fact, it was not magic, and the operator had no peculiar\r\npowers; you had simply to comply with the laws of Nature, and any one\r\ncould see for himself.\r\n\r\nIt is hard for us, at this day, to understand the opposition that sprang\r\nup against the telescope. We must remember that at this time belief in\r\nwitchcraft, fairies, sprites, ghosts, hobgoblins, magic and supernatural\r\npowers was common. Men who believe in miracles make rather poor\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\nThere were books about \"Magic,\" written by so-called scientific men,\r\nwhose standing in the world was quite as high as that of Galileo.\r\n\r\nIn Sixteen Hundred Ten, Galileo published his book entitled, \"Sidera\r\nMedicea,\" wherein he described the wonders that could be seen in the\r\nheavens by the aid of the telescope. Among other things, he said the\r\nMilky Way was not a great streak of light, but was composed of a\r\nmultitude of stars; and he made a map of the stars that could be seen\r\nonly with the aid of the telescope.\r\n\r\nThere resided in Venice at this time a scientific man by the name of\r\nPorta, who was much more popular than Galileo. He was a priest, whose\r\npiety and learning was unimpeached.\r\n\r\nThe year after Galileo issued his book, Porta put out a work much more\r\npretentious, called \"Natural Magic.\" In this book Porta does not claim\r\nthat magicians all have supernatural powers; but he goes on to prove how\r\nthey deceive the world by the use of their peculiar apparatus, and\r\nintimates that they sometimes sell their souls to the Devil, and then\r\nare positively dangerous. He dives deep into science, history and his\r\nown imagination to prove things.\r\n\r\nThe man was no fool--he constructed a kaleidoscope that showed an\r\nabsolute, geometrical symmetry, where in fact there was only confusion.\r\nHe showed how, by the use of mirrors, things could be made big, small,\r\ntall, short, wide, crooked or distorted. He told of how magicians, by\r\nthe use of Galileo's Tube, could show seven stars where there was only\r\none; and he even made such a tube of his own and called the priests\r\ntogether to look through it. He painted stars on the glass, and had men\r\nlook at the heavens. He even stuck a louse on the lens and located the\r\nbeast in the heavens, for the benefit of a doubting Cardinal. It was all\r\na joke, but at the time no sober, sincere man of Science could argue him\r\ndown. He owned \"bum\" telescopes that proved all kinds of things, to the\r\ngreat amusement of the enemies of Galileo. The intent of Porta was to\r\nexpose the frauds and fallacies of Galileo. Porta also claimed that he\r\nhad seen telescopes by which you could look over a hill and around a\r\ncorner, but he did not recommend them, since by their use things are\r\noften perceived that were not there. And so we see why the priests\r\npositively refused to look through Galileo's Tube, or to believe\r\nanything he said. Porta, and a few others like him, showed a deal more\r\nthan Galileo could and offered to locate stars anywhere on order.\r\nGalileo had much offended these priests by his statements that the Bible\r\ndid not contain the final facts of Science, and now they were getting\r\neven with a vengeance. It was all very much like the theological guffaw\r\nthat swept over Christendom when Darwin issued his \"Origin of Species,\"\r\nand Talmage and Spurgeon set their congregations in a roar by gently\r\nsarcastic references to monkey ancestry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmid the general popping of theological small-arms, Galileo moved\r\nsteadily forward. If he had many enemies he surely had a few friends. As\r\nhe once had proved more than Pisa could digest, so now he was bringing\r\nto the surface of things more truth than Padua could assimilate.\r\n\r\nVenice too was getting uncomfortable. Even the Doge said, in reply to an\r\nenthusiastic admirer of Galileo, \"Your master is not famous: he is\r\nmerely notorious.\"\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that Galileo had been living with a woman by the name\r\nof Marina Gamba, at Venice, even while he held the professorship at\r\nPadua, and that they had a son, Vincenzo Gamba, and two daughters. One\r\nof the enemy drew a map of the heavens, showing Galileo as the sun,\r\nMarina Gamba as the moon, and around them circulated numerous little\r\nsatellites, which were supposed to be their children. The picture had so\r\ngreat a vogue that the Doge issued an order that all copies of it be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nOf Marina Gamba we know very little; but the fact that she made entries\r\nin Galileo's journal and kept his accounts proves that she was a person\r\nof considerable intelligence; and this, too, was at a time when\r\nsemi-oriental ideas prevailed and education was supposedly beyond the\r\nfeminine grasp.\r\n\r\nGalileo did not marry, for the reason that he was practically a priest,\r\na teacher in a religious school, living with and looking after the\r\npupils; and the custom then was that whoever was engaged in such an\r\noccupation should not wed.\r\n\r\nThe stormy opposition to Galileo was not without its advantages. We are\r\nadvertised no less by our rabid enemies than by our loving friends.\r\nCosimo the Second, Grand Duke of Tuscany, had intimated that Florence\r\nwould give the great astronomer a welcome. Galileo moved to Florence\r\nunder the protection of Cosimo, intending to devote all his time to\r\nScience.\r\n\r\nIn giving up schoolteaching and popular lecturing, Galileo really made a\r\nvirtue of necessity. No orthodox lyceum course would tolerate him; he\r\nwas neither an impersonator nor an entertainer; the stereopticon and the\r\nmelodramatic were out of his line, and his passion for truth made him\r\nimpossible to the many.\r\n\r\nHe was treading the path of Bruno: the accusations, the taunts and\r\njeers, the denials and denunciations, were urging him on to an unseemly\r\nearnestness.\r\n\r\nFather Clavius said that Galileo never saw the satellites of Jupiter\r\nuntil he had made an instrument that would create them; and if God had\r\nintended that men should see strange things in the heavens, He would\r\nhave supplied them sufficient eyesight. The telescope was really a\r\ndevil's instrument.\r\n\r\nStill another man declared that if the earth moved, acorns falling from\r\na high tree would all fall behind the tree and not directly under it.\r\n\r\nFather Brini said that if the earth revolved, we would all fall off of\r\nit into the air when it was upside down; moreover, its whirling through\r\nspace would create a wind that would sweep it bald.\r\n\r\nFather Caccini preached a sermon from the text, \"Ye men of Galilee, why\r\nstand ye gazing up into heaven?\" Only he changed the word \"Galilee\" to\r\n\"Galileo,\" claiming it was the same thing, only different, and as reward\r\nfor his wit he was made a bishop.\r\n\r\nCardinal Bellarmine, a man of great energy, earnest, zealous, sincere,\r\nlearned--the Doctor Buckley of his day--showed how that: \"if the\r\nCopernican Theory should prevail, it would be the absolute undoing of\r\nthe Bible, and the destruction of the Church, rendering the death of\r\nChrist futile. If the earth is only one of many planets, and not the\r\ncenter of the universe, and the other planets are inhabited, the whole\r\nplan of salvation fails, since the inhabitants of the other spheres are\r\nwithout the Bible, and Christ did not die for them.\" This was the\r\nargument of Father Lecazre, and many others who took their cue from him.\r\n\r\nGalileo was denounced as \"atheist\" and \"infidel\"--epithets that do not\r\nfrighten us much now, since they have been applied to most of the really\r\ngreat and good men who have ever lived. But then such words set fire to\r\nmasses of inflammable prejudices, and there were conflagrations of wrath\r\nand hate against which it was vain to argue.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Pisa especially felt it incumbent upon him \"to bring\r\nGalileo to justice.\"\r\n\r\nGalileo was born at Pisa, educated there, taught in the University; and\r\nnow he had disgraced the place and brought it into disrepute.\r\n\r\nGalileo was still in communication with teachers at Pisa, and the\r\nArchbishop made it his business to have letters written to Galileo\r\nasking certain specific questions. One man, Castelli, declined to be\r\nused for the purpose of entrapping Galileo, but others there were who\r\nloaned themselves to the plan.\r\n\r\nIn Sixteen Hundred Sixteen, Galileo received a formal summons from Pope\r\nPaul the Fifth to come to Rome and purge himself of heresies that he had\r\nexpressed in letters which were then in the hands of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nGalileo appealed to his friends at Florence, but they were powerless.\r\nWhen the Pope issued an order, it could not be waived. The greatest\r\nthinker of his time journeyed to Rome and faced the greatest theologian\r\nof his day, Cardinal Bellarmine.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal firmly and clearly showed Galileo the error of his way.\r\nGalileo offered to prove for the Cardinal by astronomical observations\r\nthat the Copernican Theory was true. Cardinal Bellarmine said that there\r\nwas only one truth and that was spiritual truth. That the Bible was\r\ntrue, or it was not. If not, then was religion a fallacy and our hope of\r\nHeaven a delusion.\r\n\r\nGalileo contended that the death of Christ had nothing to do with the\r\ntruth, so Science and these things should not be shuffled and confused.\r\n\r\nThis attitude of mind greatly shocked the Inquisitors, and they made\r\nhaste to inform the Pope, who at once issued an order that the\r\nastronomer should be placed in a dungeon until he saw fit to disavow\r\nthat the sun was the center of the universe, and the earth moves.\r\n\r\nA sort of compromise, it seems, was here effected by Galileo's promise\r\nnot to further teach that the earth revolves.\r\n\r\nHe was kept at Rome under strict surveillance for some months, but was\r\nfinally allowed to return to Florence, and cautioned that he must cease\r\nall public teaching, speaking and writing on the subject of astronomy.\r\nOn March Fifth, Sixteen Hundred Sixteen, the consulting theologians of\r\nthe Holy Office reiterated that the propositions of Galileo, that the\r\nsun is the center of the universe, and that the earth has a rotary\r\nmotion, were \"absurd in philosophy, heretical, and also contrary to\r\nScripture.\"\r\n\r\nThe works of Copernicus were then placed upon the \"Index,\" and Pope Paul\r\nissued a special decree, warning all Churchmen to \"abjure, shun and\r\nforever abstain from giving encouragement, support, succor or friendship\r\nto any one who believed or taught that the earth revolves.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of Copernicus was not removed from the \"Index\" until the year\r\nEighteen Hundred Eighteen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGalileo made his way back to Florence, defeated and disappointed. He had\r\nnot been tortured, except mentally, but he had heard the dungeon-key\r\nturned in the big lock and felt the humiliation of being made a captive.\r\nThe instruments of torture had been shown to him, and he had heard the\r\ncries of the condemned.\r\n\r\nThe cell that Bruno had occupied was his, and he was also taken to the\r\nspot where Bruno was burned: the place was there, but where was Bruno!\r\n\r\nHe realized how utterly impossible it was to teach truth to those who\r\ndid not desire truth, and the vanity of replying to men for whom a pun\r\nanswered the purposes of fact.\r\n\r\nAs he could neither teach nor lecture at Florence, his services to the\r\nCourt were valueless. He was a disgraced and silenced man.\r\n\r\nHe retired to a village a few miles from the city, and in secret\r\ncontinued his studies and observations. The Grand Duke supplied him a\r\nsmall pension and suggested that it would be increased if Galileo would\r\ngive lectures on Poetry and Rhetoric, which were not forbidden themes,\r\nand try to make himself either commonplace or amusing.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine the reply--Galileo had but one theme, the wonders of the\r\nheavens above.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo the years went by, and Galileo, sixty-seven years old, was\r\nimpoverished and forgotten, yet in his proud heart burned the embers of\r\nambition. He believed in himself; he believed in the sacredness of his\r\none mission. Pope Paul had gone on his long journey, for even infallible\r\npopes die. Cardinal Barberini had become Pope Urban the Eighth. Years\r\nbefore, Galileo and Barberini had taught together at Padua, and when\r\nGalileo was silenced, a long letter of sympathy had come from his old\r\ncolleague, and occasionally since they had exchanged friendly letters.\r\nGalileo thought that Urban was his friend, and he knew that Urban, in\r\nhis heart, believed in the theory of Copernicus.\r\n\r\nGalileo then emerged from his seclusion and began teaching and speaking\r\nin Florence. He also fitted up an observatory and invited the scholars\r\nto make use of his telescope.\r\n\r\nFather Melchior hereupon put forth a general denunciation, aimed\r\nespecially at Galileo, without mentioning his name, to this effect: \"The\r\nopinion of the earth's motion is, of all heresies, the most abominable,\r\nthe most pernicious, the most scandalous: the immovability of the earth\r\nis thrice sacred.\r\n\r\n\"An argument against the existence of God and the immortality of the\r\nsoul would be sooner tolerated than the idea that the earth moves.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to this fusillade, in Sixteen Hundred Thirty-two Galileo put\r\nforth his book entitled, \"The Dialogue,\" which was intended to place the\r\nideas of Copernicus in popular form.\r\n\r\nGalileo had endeavored to communicate with Urban, but the Pope had\r\nchosen to ignore him--to consider him as one dead. Galileo misconstrued\r\nthe silence, thinking it meant that he could do and say what he wished\r\nand that there would be no interference.\r\n\r\nA copy of Galileo's book reaching the Pope, his silence was at once\r\nbroken. The book was condemned and all copies found were ordered to be\r\nburned by the hangman in the public streets. But the book had met with a\r\nwide sale and many copies had been carried to Germany, England and\r\nFrance, and in these countries the work was reprinted and sent back to\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nUrban ordered Galileo to present himself at Rome forthwith. A score of\r\nyears had passed since Galileo's former visit--he had not forgotten it.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to the Pope and apologized for having broken the silence\r\nimposed upon him by Pope Paul; he offered to go into retirement again;\r\nstated that he was old, infirm, without funds, and excused himself from\r\nobeying the order to go to Rome.\r\n\r\nBut excuses and apologies were unavailing.\r\n\r\nA preventory order was issued and sent to the Papal Nuncio at Florence.\r\n\r\nThis was equivalent to an arrest. Galileo must go to Rome and answer for\r\nhaving broken the promises he had made to the Inquisition. If he would\r\nnot go willingly, he should go in chains.\r\n\r\nArriving at Rome, he had several audiences with the Pope, who said\r\nnothing would answer but a specific recantation.\r\n\r\nWhat Barberini had once believed was one thing, and what the Pope must\r\ndo was another. Galileo should recant in order to keep the people from\r\nthinking Pope Urban would allow what his predecessors would not.\r\n\r\nThe matter had become a public scandal.\r\n\r\nGalileo tried to argue the question and asked for time to consider it.\r\n\r\nAn order was issued that he should be imprisoned. It was done.\r\n\r\nGalileo asked for pens and paper that he might prepare his defense.\r\nThese were refused, and an order of torture was issued. It was not a\r\ntrial, defense was useless. Again he was asked to recant--the matter was\r\nall written out--he had but to sign his name. He refused. He was brought\r\nto the torture-chamber.\r\n\r\nLegend and fact separate here.\r\n\r\nThere are denials from Churchmen that Galileo was so much as imprisoned.\r\nOne writer has even tried to show that Galileo was a guest of the Pope\r\nand dined daily at his table. The other side has told us that Galileo\r\nwas thrust into a dungeon, his eyes put out, and his old broken-down\r\nform tortured on the wheel.\r\n\r\nRecent careful researches reveal that neither side told the truth. We\r\nhave official record of the case written out at the time for the\r\nVatican archives. Galileo was imprisoned and the order of torture\r\nissued, but it was never enforced. Perhaps it was not the intention to\r\nenforce it: it may have been only a \"war measure.\"\r\n\r\nGalileo was alternately taken from dungeon to palace that he might\r\nrealize which course was best for him to pursue--oppose the Church or\r\nuphold it.\r\n\r\nThus we see that there was some truth in the statement that \"he dined\r\ndaily with the Pope.\"\r\n\r\nThat the man was subjected to much indignity, all the world now knows.\r\nThe official records are in the Vatican, and the attempt to conceal them\r\nlonger is out of the question. Wise Churchmen no longer deny the\r\nblunders of the past, but they say with Cardinal Satolli, \"The enemies\r\nof the Church have ever been o'er-zealous Churchmen.\"\r\n\r\nOn bended knees, Galileo, a man of threescore and ten, broken in health,\r\nwith spirit crushed, repeated after a priest these words: \"I, Galileo\r\nGalilei, being in my seventieth year, a prisoner, on my knees before\r\nyour Eminences, the Cardinals of the Holy See, having before mine eyes\r\nthe Holy Bible, which I touch with my hands and kiss with my lips, do\r\nabjure, curse and detest the error and heresy of the movement of the\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nHe also was made to sign the recantation. On arising from his knees,\r\nlegend declares that he said, \"Yet the earth does move!\"\r\n\r\nIt is hardly probable that the words reached his lips, although they may\r\nhave been in his mind. But we must remember the man's heart was broken,\r\nand he was in a mental condition where nothing really mattered. To\r\ncomplete his dishonor, all of his writings were placed on the \"Index,\"\r\nand he was made to swear that he would inform the Inquisition of any man\r\nwhom he should hear or discover supporting the heresy of the motion of\r\nthe earth. The old man was then released, a prisoner on parole, and\r\nallowed to make his way home to Florence, which he did by easy stages,\r\nhelped along the way by friendly monks who discussed with him all\r\nquestions but those of astronomy.\r\n\r\nGalileo's eldest daughter, a nun, whose home was near his, was so\r\naffected by the humiliation of her father that she fell into a nervous\r\ndecline and died very soon after he reached home.\r\n\r\nBetween these two there had been a close bond of love and tender\r\nsympathy, and her death seemed almost the crowning calamity.\r\n\r\nBut once back in his village home at Arcetri, Galileo again went to work\r\nwith his telescope, mapping the heavens.\r\n\r\nA goodly degree of health and animation came back to him, but his\r\neyesight, so long misused, now failed him and he became blind. Thus John\r\nMilton found him in Sixteen Hundred Thirty-eight.\r\n\r\nCastelli, his lifelong friend, wrote to another, \"The noblest eye that\r\nGod ever made is darkened: the eye so privileged that it may in truth be\r\nsaid to have seen more wonderful things and made others to see more\r\nwonderful things, than were ever seen before.\" But blindness could not\r\nsubdue him any more than it could John Milton. He had others look\r\nthrough the telescope and tell him what they saw and then he would\r\nforetell what they would see next.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Pope was that Galileo should not be disturbed so long\r\nas he kept to his village home and taught merely the few scholars or\r\n\"servants,\" as they called themselves, who often came to him; but these\r\nwere to be taught mathematics, not astronomy. That he was even at the\r\nlast under suspicion is shown that concealed in the mattress of the bed\r\nupon which he died were records of his latest discoveries concerning the\r\nrevolution of the planets. Legal opposition was made as to his right to\r\nmake a will, the claim being that he was a prisoner of the Inquisition\r\nat his death. For the same reason his body was not allowed to be buried\r\nin consecrated ground. The Pope overruled the objection and he was\r\nburied in an obscure corner of the little cemetery of Saint Croce, the\r\ngrave unmarked.\r\n\r\nSo the last few years of Galileo's life were years of comparative peace\r\nand quiet. He needed but little, and this little his few faithful,\r\nloving friends supplied. His death came painlessly, and his last moments\r\nwere sustained by the faith that he would soon be free from the\r\ntrammels of the flesh--free to visit some of the worlds that his\r\ntelescope had brought so near to him.\r\n\r\nGalileo was born the day that Michelangelo died; the year of his death\r\nwas the year that Sir Isaac Newton, the discoverer of the law of\r\ngravitation, was born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COPERNICUS]\r\n\r\nCOPERNICUS\r\n\r\n\r\n     To know the mighty works of God; to comprehend His wisdom and\r\n     majesty and power; to appreciate, in degree, the wonderful working\r\n     of His laws, surely all this must be a pleasing and acceptable mode\r\n     of worship to the Most High, to whom ignorance can not be more\r\n     grateful than knowledge.\r\n\r\n     --_Copernicus_\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPERNICUS\r\n\r\nWhen a prominent member of Congress, of slightly convivial turn,\r\nwent to sleep on the floor of the House of Representatives and suddenly\r\nawakening, convulsed the assemblage by demanding in a loud voice, \"Where\r\nam I at?\" he propounded an inquiry that is indisputably a classic.\r\n\r\nWith the very first glimmering of intelligence, and as far back as\r\nhistory goes, man has always asked that question, also three others:\r\n\r\nWhere am I?\r\n\r\nWho am I?\r\n\r\nWhat am I here for?\r\n\r\nWhere am I going?\r\n\r\nA question implies an answer and so, coeval with the questioner, we find\r\na class of Volunteers springing into being, who have taken upon\r\nthemselves the business of answering the interrogations.\r\n\r\nAnd as partial payment for answering these questions, the man who\r\nanswered has exacted a living from the man who asked, also titles,\r\nhonors, gauds, jewels and obsequies.\r\n\r\nFurther than this, the Volunteer who answered has declared himself\r\nexempt from all useful labor. This Volunteer is our theologian.\r\n\r\nWalt Whitman has said:\r\n\r\n  I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid\r\n    and self-contained,\r\n  I stand and look at them long and long.\r\n  They do not sweat and whine about their condition,\r\n  They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,\r\n  They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,\r\n  Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of\r\n    owning things,\r\n  Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands\r\n    of years ago,\r\n  Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\r\n\r\nBut we should note this fact: Whitman merely wanted to live with\r\nanimals--he did not desire to become one. He wasn't willing to forfeit\r\nknowledge; and a part of that knowledge was that man has some things yet\r\nto learn from the patient brute. Much of man's misery has come from his\r\npersistent questioning.\r\n\r\nThe book of Genesis is certainly right when it tells us that man's\r\ntroubles came from a desire to know. The fruit of the tree of knowledge\r\nis bitter, and man's digestive apparatus is ill-conditioned to digest\r\nit. But still we are grateful, and good men never forget that it was\r\nwoman who gave the fruit to man--men learn nothing alone. In the Garden\r\nof Eden, with everything supplied, man was an animal, but when he was\r\nturned out and had to work, strive, struggle and suffer, he began to\r\ngrow.\r\n\r\nThe Volunteers of the Far East have told us that man's deliverance from\r\nthe evils of life must come through killing desire; we will reach\r\nNirvana--rest--through nothingness. But within a decade it has been\r\nborne in upon a vast number of the thinking men of the world that\r\ndeliverance from sorrow and discontent was to be had not through ceasing\r\nto ask questions, but by asking one question more. The question is this,\r\n\"What can I do?\"\r\n\r\nWhen man went to work, action removed the doubt that theory could not\r\nsolve.\r\n\r\nThe rushing winds purify the air; only running water is pure; and the\r\nholy man, if there be such, is the one who loses himself in persistent,\r\nuseful effort. By working for all, we secure the best results for self,\r\nand when we truly work for self, we work for all.\r\n\r\nIn that thoughtful essay by Brooks Adams, \"The Law of Civilization and\r\nDecay,\" the author says, \"Thought is one of the manifestations of human\r\nenergy, and among the earlier and simpler phases of thought, two stand\r\nconspicuous--Fear and Greed: Fear, which, by stimulating the\r\nimagination, creates a belief in an invisible world, and ultimately\r\ndevelops a priesthood.\"\r\n\r\nThe priestly class evolves naturally into being everywhere as man\r\nawakens and asks questions. \"Only the Unknown is terrible,\" says Victor\r\nHugo. We can cope with the known, and at the worst we can overcome the\r\nunknown by accepting it. Verestchagin, the great painter who knew the\r\npsychology of war as few have known, and went down to his death\r\ngloriously, as he should, on a sinking battleship, once said, \"In modern\r\nwarfare, when man does not see his enemy, the poetry of the battle is\r\ngone, and man is rendered by the Unknown into a quaking coward.\"\r\n\r\nBut when enveloped in the fog of ignorance every phenomenon of Nature\r\ncauses man to quake and tremble--he wants to know! Fear prompts him to\r\nask, and Greed--greed for power, place and pelf--answers.\r\n\r\nTo succeed beyond the average is to realize a weakness in humanity and\r\nthen bank on it. The priest who pacifies is as natural as the fear he\r\nseeks to assuage--as natural as man himself.\r\n\r\nSo first, man is in bondage to his fear, and this bondage he exchanges\r\nfor bondage to a priest. First, he fears the unknown; second, he fears\r\nthe priest who has power with the unknown.\r\n\r\nSoon the priest becomes a slave to the answers he has conjured forth. He\r\ngrows to believe what he at first pretended to know. The punishment of\r\nevery liar is that he eventually believes his lies. The mind of man\r\nbecomes tinted and subdued to what he works in, like the dyer's hand.\r\n\r\nSo we have the formula: Man in bondage to fear. Man in bondage to a\r\npriest. The priest in bondage to a creed.\r\n\r\nThen the priest and his institution become an integral part and parcel\r\nof the State, mixed in all its affairs. The success of the State seems\r\nto lie in holding belief intact and stilling all further questions of\r\nthe people, transferring all doubts to this Volunteer Class which\r\nanswers for a consideration.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the man who does not accept the answers is regarded as an\r\nenemy of the State--that is, the enemy of mankind.\r\n\r\nTo keep this questioner down has been the problem of every religion. And\r\nthe great problem of progress has been to smuggle the newly-discovered\r\ntruth past Cerberus, the priest, by preparing a sop that was to him\r\npalatable.\r\n\r\nFrom every branch of Science the priest has been routed, save in\r\nSociology alone. Here he has stubbornly made his last stand, and is\r\nsaving himself alive by slowly accepting the situation and transforming\r\nhimself into the Promoter of a Social Club.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe attempt to ascertain the truths of physical science outside of\r\ntheology was, in the early ages, very seldom ventured. When men wanted\r\nto know anything about anything, they asked the priest.\r\n\r\nQuestions that the priest could not answer he declared were forbidden of\r\nman to know; and when men attempted to find out for themselves they were\r\nlooked upon as heretics.\r\n\r\nThe early church regarded the earth as a flat surface with four corners.\r\nAnd in proof of their position they quoted Saint Paul, who wanted the\r\ngospel carried to the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the universe was a house. The upper story was Heaven, the lower\r\nstory was the Earth, and the cellar was Hell. God, the angels and the\r\n\"saved\" lived in Heaven, man lived on Earth, and the devils and the\r\ndamned had Hell to themselves.\r\n\r\n\"And there shall be no night there,\" and this was proven by the stars,\r\nwhich were regarded as peepholes through which mortals could catch\r\nglimpses of the wondrous light of Heaven beyond. Hell was below, as was\r\nclearly shown by volcanoes, when the fierce fires occasionally forced\r\nthemselves up through. Darkness to children is always terrible, and the\r\nnight is regarded by them as the time of evil.\r\n\r\nLater, Churchmen came to believe that the stars were jewels hung in the\r\nsky every night by angels whose business it was to look after them.\r\n\r\nThe word \"firmament\" means a solid dome or roof. This firmament, the\r\nsky, was supposed to be the floor of Heaven. The firmament had four\r\ncorners and rested on the mountains, as the eye could plainly see. When\r\nGod's car was rolled across the floor we heard thunder, and his\r\nmovements were always accompanied by lightnings, winds, black clouds and\r\nrain--all this so He could not be too plainly seen.\r\n\r\nHeaven was only a little way off--a few miles at the most. So there were\r\nattempts made at times by bad men to reach it. The Greeks had a story\r\nabout the Aloidæ who piled mountain upon mountain; the Bible story of\r\nthe Tower of Babel is the same, where the masons called, \"More mort,\"\r\nand those below sent up bricks. There is also an ancient Mexican legend\r\nof giants who built the Pyramid of Cholula, and they would have been\r\nsuccessful in their attempts if fire had not been thrown down upon them\r\nfrom Heaven. In all \"Holy Writ\" we find accounts of \"ascensions,\"\r\n\"translations,\" \"annunciations,\" and mortals caught up into the clouds.\r\nMany people had actually seen angels ascending and descending.\r\n\r\n\"Messengers from on high\" and God's secretaries were constantly coming\r\ndown on delicate errands. Everything that man did was noted and written\r\ndown. We were watched all the time by unseen beings. The Bible tells of\r\nhow the Earth was eventually to be destroyed, and then there would be\r\nonly Heaven and Hell. God, His Son and the angels were going to come\r\ndown, and for ages men watched the heavens to see them appear.\r\n\r\nAll sensitive children, born of orthodox Christian parents, who heard\r\nthe Bible read aloud, looked fearfully into the sky for \"signs and\r\nwonders.\" The Bible tells in several places of devils breaking out of\r\nHell and roaming over the earth. Dante fully believed in this\r\nthree-story-house idea, and pictures with awful exactness the details,\r\nwhich he gained from the preaching of the priests. Dante was never\r\nhonored by having his books placed on the \"Index.\" On the contrary, he\r\ngot his vogue largely through the recommendation of the priests. To them\r\nhe was a true scientist, for he corroborated their statements.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Fathers ridiculed the idea of the earth being round,\r\nbecause, if this were so, how could the people on the other side see the\r\nSon of Man when He came in the sky? Besides that, if the earth were\r\nround and turned on its axis, we would all fall off into space.\r\n\r\nThe idea that there was an ocean above the earth, in the heavens, was\r\nbrought forward to show the goodness and wisdom of God. Without this\r\nthere would be no rain and hence no vegetation, and man would soon\r\nperish. In Genesis we read that God said, \"Let there be a firmament in\r\nthe midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters,\"\r\nAnd in Psalms, \"Praise Him, ye heavens of heavens and ye waters that be\r\nabove the heavens.\" Then we hear, \"The windows of Heaven were opened.\"\r\nSo this thought of the waters above the earth was fully proved, accepted\r\nand fixed, and to pray for rain was quite a natural thing.\r\n\r\nThe English Prayer-Book contained such prayers up to within a very few\r\nyears ago, and in Eighteen Hundred Eighty-three the Governor of Kansas\r\nset apart a day upon which the people were to pray that God would open\r\nthe windows of Heaven and send them rain. They also prayed to be\r\ndelivered from grasshoppers, just as in Queen Elizabeth's time the\r\nPrayer-Book had this, \"From the Turk and the Comet, good Lord deliver\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Sixth Century, Cosmos, one of the Saints, wrote a complete\r\nexplanation of the phenomena of the heavens. To account for the movement\r\nof the sun, he said God had His angels push it across the firmament and\r\nput it behind a mountain each night, and the next morning it was brought\r\nout on the other side. He met every objection by citations from Job,\r\nGenesis, Ezekiel, Ecclesiastes and the New Testament, and wound up with\r\nan anathema upon any or all who doubted or questioned in this matter of\r\nastronomy.\r\n\r\nThe whole Christian idea of the Universe was simple, plain and\r\nplausible. The child-mind could easily accept it, and when backed up by\r\nthe Holy Book, written at God's dictation, word for word, infallible\r\nand absolutely true in every part, one does not wonder that progress was\r\npractically blocked for fourteen hundred years, but the real miracle is\r\nthat it was not blocked forever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThousands of years before Christ, the Chinese had mapped the heavens and\r\nknew the movements of the planets so well that they correctly prophesied\r\nthe positions of the various constellations many years in advance.\r\nTwenty-five hundred years before our Christian era a Chinese Governor\r\nput to death the astronomers Hi and Ho because they had failed to\r\nforetell an eclipse, quite according to the excellent Celestial plan of\r\nkilling the doctor when the patient dies.\r\n\r\nSir William Hamilton points out the fact that the Chinese, five thousand\r\nyears ago, knew astronomy as well as we do, and that Christian astrology\r\ngrew out of Chinese astronomy, in an effort to foretell the fortunes of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nFear wants to know the future, and astrology and priesthood are\r\nsynonymous terms, since the business of the priest has always been to\r\nprophesy, a profession he has not yet discarded. Their prophecies are at\r\npresent innocuous and lightly heeded. They preach that perfect faith\r\nwill move a mountain, but energetic railroad-builders of today find it\r\nquicker and cheaper to tunnel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA certain type of man accepts a certain theory.\r\n\r\nThe Christian view of creation was practically the conception of the\r\nGreeks before Thales. This wise man, in the Sixth Century before Christ,\r\ntaught that the earth was round, and that certain stars were also\r\nworlds. He showed that the earth was round and proved it by the\r\ndisappearance of the ship as it sailed away. He located the earth, moon\r\nand sun so perfectly that he prophesied an eclipse, and when it took\r\nplace it so terrified the Medes and the Lydians, who were in battle with\r\neach other, that they threw down their arms and made peace. Thales had\r\nexplained that Atlas carried the world on his shoulder, but he didn't\r\nexplain what Atlas stood upon.\r\n\r\nPythagoras, one of the pupils of Thales, following the idea still\r\nfurther, showed that the moon derived its light from the sun; that the\r\nearth was a globe and turned daily on its axis.\r\n\r\nHe held that the sun was the center of the universe and that the planets\r\nrevolved around it. Anaxagoras followed a few years later than\r\nPythagoras, and became convinced that the sun was merely a ball of fire\r\nand therefore should not be worshiped; that it follows a natural law,\r\nthat nothing ever happens by chance, and that to pray for rain is\r\nabsurd.\r\n\r\nFor his honesty in expressing what he thought was truth, the priests of\r\nAthens had Anaxagoras and his family exiled to perpetual banishment\r\nfrom Athens and all of his books were burned.\r\n\r\nPlato touched on Astronomy, for he touches on everything, and fully\r\nbelieved that the earth was round.\r\n\r\nHis pupil, Aristotle, taught all that Anaxagoras taught, and if he also\r\nhad not been exiled, but had been free to study, investigate and express\r\nhimself, he would have come very close to the truth.\r\n\r\nHipparchus, a hundred years after Aristotle, calculated the length of\r\nthe year to within six minutes, discovered the precession of equinoxes\r\nand counted all the stars he could see, making a map of them.\r\n\r\nSeventy years after Christ, Ptolemy, a Greco-Egyptian, but not of the\r\nroyal line of Ptolemies, published his great book, \"The Almagest.\" For\r\nover fourteen centuries it was the textbook for the best astronomers.\r\n\r\nIt taught that the earth was the center of the universe, and that the\r\nsun and the planets revolve around it. There were many absurdities,\r\nhowever, that had to be explained, and the priests practically rejected\r\nthe whole book as \"pagan\" and taught an astronomy of their own, founded\r\nentirely upon the Bible. They wanted an explanation that would be\r\naccepted by the common people.\r\n\r\nThis astronomy was not designed to be very scientific, exact or\r\ntruthful--all they asked was, \"Is it plausible?\" Expediency, to\r\ntheology, has always been much more important than truth.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" said Saint Basil, \"what boots it concerning all this\r\nconjecture about the stars, since the earth is soon to come to an end,\r\nas is shown by our Holy Scriptures, and man's business is to prepare his\r\nsoul for eternity?\"\r\n\r\nThis was the general attitude of the Church--exact truth was a matter of\r\nindifference. And if Science tended to unseat men's faith in the Bible,\r\nand in God's most holy religion, then so much the worse for Science.\r\n\r\nIt will thus plainly be seen why the Church felt compelled to fight\r\nScience--the very life of the Church was at stake.\r\n\r\nThe Church was the vital thing--not truth. If truth could be taught\r\nwithout unseating faith, why, all right, but anything that made men\r\ndoubt must be rooted out at any cost. And that is why priests have\r\nopposed Science, not that they hate Science less, but that they love the\r\nChurch more.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Ptolemy to that of Copernicus--fourteen hundred\r\nyears--theology practically dictated the learning of the world. And to\r\nCopernicus must be given the credit of having really awakened the\r\nscience of astronomy from her long and peaceful sleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe little land that we know as Poland has produced some of the finest\r\nand most acute intellects the world has ever known.\r\n\r\nTragic and blood-stained is her history, and this tragedy, perhaps, has\r\nbeen a prime factor in the evolution of her men of worth. Poland has\r\nbeen stamped upon and pushed apart; and a persecuted people produce a\r\npride of race that has its outcrop in occasional genius.\r\n\r\nRecently we heard of the great Paderewski playing before the Czar, and\r\nHis Majesty, in a speech meant to be very complimentary, congratulated\r\nthe company that so great a genius as he was a citizen of Russia.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty, I am not a Russian--I am a Pole!\" was the proud reply.\r\n\r\nThe Czar replied, smiling, \"There is no such country as Poland--now\r\nthere is only Russia!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Paderewski replied, \"Pardon my hasty remark--you speak but truth.\"\r\nAnd then he played Chopin's \"Funeral March,\" a dirge not only to the\r\ngreat men of Poland gone, but to Poland herself.\r\n\r\nNicholas Copernicus was born at the quaint old town of Thorn, in Poland,\r\nFebruary Nineteen, Fourteen Hundred Seventy-three. The family name was\r\nKoppernigk, but Nicholas latinized it when he became of age, and\r\nseemingly separated from his immediate kinsmen forever.\r\n\r\nHis father was a merchant, fairly prosperous, and only in the line of\r\nmoney-making was he ambitious. In the Koppernigks ran a goodly strain of\r\nJewish blood, but a generation before, pressure and expediency seemed to\r\ncombine, so that the family, as we first see them, were Christians. No\r\nsoil can grow genius, no seed can produce it--it springs into being in\r\nspite of all laws and rules and regulations. \"No hovel is safe from it,\"\r\nsays Whistler.\r\n\r\nThe portraits of Copernicus reveal a man of most marked personality:\r\nproud, handsome, self-contained, intellectual. The head is massive, eyes\r\nfull, luminous, wide apart, his nose large and bold, chin strong, the\r\nmouth alone revealing a trace of the feminine, as though the man were\r\nthe child of his mother. This mother had a brother who was a bishop, and\r\nthe mother's ambition for her boy was that he should eventually follow\r\nin the footsteps of this illustrious brother who was known for a hundred\r\nmiles as a preacher of marked ability.\r\n\r\nSo we hear of the young man being sent to the University of Cracow, as\r\nthe preliminary to a great career.\r\n\r\nThe father bitterly opposed the idea of taking his son out of the\r\npractical world of business, and this evidently led to the breach that\r\ncaused young Nicholas to discard the family name.\r\n\r\nThat Nicholas did not fully enter into his mother's plans is shown that\r\nwhile at Cracow he devoted himself mostly to medicine. He was so\r\nproficient in this that he secured a physician's degree; and having been\r\ngiven leave to practise he revealed his humanity by declining to do so,\r\nturning to mathematics with a fine frenzy.\r\n\r\nThis disposition to drop on a thing, turn loose on it, concentrate, and\r\nreduce it to a chaos, is the true distinguishing mark of genius. The\r\ndifference in men does not lie in the size of their heads, nor in the\r\nperfection of their bodies, but in this one sublime ability of\r\nconcentration--to throw the weight with the blow, live an eternity in an\r\nhour--\"This one thing I do!\"\r\n\r\nCopernicus at twenty-one was teaching mathematics at Cracow, and by his\r\nextraordinary ability in this one direction had attracted the attention\r\nof various learned men. In fact the authorities of the college had grown\r\na bit boastful of their star student, and when visiting dignitaries\r\narrived, young Copernicus was given chalk and blackboard and put through\r\nhis paces. Problems involving a dozen figures and many fractions were\r\nworked out by him with a directness and precision that made him the\r\nwonder of that particular part of the world.\r\n\r\nThe science of trigonometry was invented by Copernicus, and we see that\r\nearly in his twenties he was well on the heels of it, for he had then\r\narranged a quadrant to measure the height of standing trees, steeples,\r\nbuildings or mountains. For rest and recreation he painted pictures.\r\n\r\nA college professor from Bologna traveling through Cracow met\r\nCopernicus, and greatly impressed with his powers, invited him to\r\nreturn with him to Bologna and there give a course of lectures on\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\nCopernicus accepted, and at Bologna met the astronomer, Novarra. This\r\nmeeting was the turning-point of his life. Copernicus was then\r\ntwenty-three years of age, but in intellect he was a man. He had vowed a\r\nyear before that he would indulge in no trivial conversation about\r\npersons or things--only the great and noble themes should interest him\r\nand occupy his attention.\r\n\r\nWith commonplace or ignorant people he held no converse. He had\r\nremarkable beauty of person and great dignity, and his presence at\r\nBologna won immediate respect for him.\r\n\r\nMen accept other men at the estimate they place upon themselves.\r\n\r\nIn listening to lectures by Novarra, he perceived at once how\r\nmathematics could be made valuable in calculating the movement of stars.\r\n\r\nNovarra taught the Ptolemaic theory of astronomy for the esoteric few.\r\nThe Church is made up of men, and while priests for the most part are\r\nquite content to believe what the Church teaches, yet it has ever been\r\nrecognized that there was one doctrine for the Few, and another for the\r\nMany--the esoteric and the exoteric. The esoteric is an edged tool, and\r\nonly a very few are fit to handle it. The charge of heresy is only for\r\nthose who are so foolish as to give out these edged tools to the\r\npeople. You may talk about anything you want, provided you do not do it;\r\nand you may do anything you want, provided you do not talk about it.\r\n\r\nThe proposition that the earth was flat, had four corners, and the stars\r\nwere jewels hung in the sky as \"signs,\" and were moved about by angels,\r\nwas all right for the many, but now and then there were priests who were\r\nnot content with these child-stories--they wanted truth--and these\r\nusually accepted the theories of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nNovarra believed that the earth was a globe; that this globe was the\r\ncenter of the universe, and that around the earth the sun, moon and\r\ncertain stars revolved. The fixed stars he still regarded as being hung\r\nagainst the firmament, and that this firmament was turned in some\r\nmysterious way, en masse.\r\n\r\nCopernicus listened silently, but his heart beat fast. He had found\r\nsomething upon which he could exercise his mathematics. He and Novarra\r\nsat up all night in the belfry of the cathedral and watched the stars.\r\n\r\nThey saw that they moved steadily, surely and without caprice. It was\r\nall natural, and could be reduced, Copernicus thought, to a mathematical\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nAstrology and astronomy were not then divorced. It was astrology that\r\ngave us astronomy. The angel that watched over a star looked after all\r\npersons who were born under that star's influence, or else appointed\r\nsome other angel for the purpose. Every person had a guardian angel to\r\nprotect him from the evil spirits that occasionally broke out of Hell\r\nand came up to earth to tempt men.\r\n\r\nMathematics knows nothing of angels--it only knows what it can prove.\r\nCopernicus believed that, if certain stars did move, they moved by some\r\nunalterable law of their own. In riding on a boat he observed that the\r\nshores seemed to be moving past, and he concluded that a part, at least,\r\nof the seeming movements of planets might possibly be caused by the\r\nmoving of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn talking with astrologers he perceived that very seldom did they know\r\nanything of mathematics. And this ignorance on their part caused him to\r\ndoubt them entirely.\r\n\r\nHis faith was in mathematics--the thing that could be proved--and he\r\ncame to the conclusion that astronomy and mathematics were one thing,\r\nand astrology and child-stories another.\r\n\r\nHe remained at Bologna just long enough to turn the astrologers out of\r\nthe society of astronomers.\r\n\r\nNovarra's lectures on astronomy were given in Latin, and in truth all\r\nlearning was locked up in this tongue. But astrology and the theological\r\nfairy-tales of the people floated free. They were a part of the vagrant\r\nhagiology of the roadside preachers, who with lurid imaginations said\r\nthe things they thought would help carry conviction home and make\r\n\"believers.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Bologna Copernicus then moved on to Padua, where he remained two\r\nyears, teaching and giving lectures. Here he devoted considerable time\r\nto chemistry, and on leaving he was honored by being given a degree by\r\nthe University. Next we find him at Rome, a professor in mathematics and\r\nalso giving lectures on chemistry. His lectures were not for the\r\npopulace--they were for the learned few. But they attracted the\r\nattention of the best, and were commented upon and quoted by the various\r\nother teachers, preachers and lecturers. A daring thinker who expresses\r\nhimself without reservation states the things that various others know\r\nand would like to state if they dared. It is often very convenient when\r\nyou want a thing said to enclose the matter in quotation-marks. It\r\nrelieves one from the responsibility of standing sponsor for it, if the\r\nhypothesis does not prove popular.\r\n\r\nCopernicus was only nineteen years old when Columbus discovered America,\r\nbut it seems he did not hear of Columbus until he reached Bologna in\r\nFourteen Hundred Ninety-five. At Rome he made various references to\r\nColumbus in his lectures; dwelt upon the truth that the earth was a\r\nglobe; mentioned the obvious fact that in sailing westward Columbus did\r\nnot sail his ship over the edge of the earth into Hell, as had been\r\nprophesied he would.\r\n\r\nHe also explained that the red sky at sunset was not caused by the\r\nreflections from Hell, nor was the sun moved behind a mountain by giant\r\nangels at night. Copernicus was a Catholic, as all teachers were, but he\r\nhad been deceived by the esoteric and the exoteric, and had really\r\nthought that the priests and so-called educated men actually desired,\r\nfor themselves, to know the truth.\r\n\r\nAt Padua he had learned to read Greek, and had become more or less\r\nfamiliar with Pythagoras, Hipparchus, Aristotle and Plato. He quoted\r\nthese authors and showed how in some ways they were beyond the present.\r\nThis was all done in the exuberance of youth, with never a doubt as to\r\nthe value and the beauty of the Church. But he was thinking more of\r\ntruth than of the Church, and when a cardinal from the Vatican came to\r\nhim, and in all kindness cautioned him, and in love explained it was all\r\nright for a man to believe what he wished, but to teach others things\r\nthat were not authorized was a mistake.\r\n\r\nCopernicus was abashed and depressed.\r\n\r\nHe saw then that his lectures had really been for himself--he was\r\nendeavoring to make things plain to Copernicus, and the welfare of the\r\nChurch had been forgotten.\r\n\r\nHe ceased lecturing for a time, but private pupils came to him, and\r\namong them astrologers in disguise, and these went away and told\r\nbroadcast that Copernicus was teaching that the movements of the stars\r\nwere not caused by angels, and that \"God was being dethroned by a\r\ntape-measure and a yardstick.\" Alchemy had a strong hold upon the\r\npopular mind, and these alchemists and astrologers were fortune-tellers\r\nand derived a goodly income from the people.\r\n\r\nThey had their stands in front of all churches and turned in a goodly\r\ntithe \"for the benefit of the poor.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the astrologers attacked Copernicus he tried to explain that the\r\nheavens were under the reign of natural law, and that so far as he knew\r\nthere was no direct relationship between the stars and the men upon\r\nearth. The answer was, \"You yourself foretell the eclipse, and assume to\r\nknow when a star will be in a certain place a hundred years in advance;\r\nnow, if you can prophesy about stars, why can't we foretell a man's\r\nfuture?\"\r\n\r\nCopernicus proudly declined to answer such ignorance, but went on to say\r\nthat alchemy was a violence to chemistry as much as astrology was to\r\nastronomy. In chemistry there were exact results that could be computed\r\nby mathematics and foretold; it was likewise so in astronomy.\r\n\r\nCopernicus was philosopher enough to know that astrology led to\r\nastronomy, and alchemy led to chemistry, but he said all he wished to do\r\nwas to eliminate error and find the truth, and when we have ascertained\r\nthe laws of God in reference to these things, we should discard the use\r\nof black cats, goggles, peaked hats, red fire and incantations--these\r\nthings were sacrilege. And the enemy declared that Copernicus was guilty\r\nof heresy in saying they were guilty of sacrilege. Moreover, black cats\r\nwere not as bad as blackboards.\r\n\r\nThe Pope certainly had no idea of treating Copernicus harshly; in fact,\r\nhe greatly admired him--but peace was the thing desired. Copernicus was\r\ncreating a schism, and there was danger that the revenues would be\r\naffected. The Pope sent for Copernicus, received him with great honor,\r\nblessed him, and suggested that he return at once to his native town of\r\nThorn and there await good news that would come to him soon.\r\n\r\nCopernicus was overwhelmed with gratitude--he was in difficulties.\r\n\r\nCertain priests had publicly denounced him; others had urged him on to\r\nunseemliness in debate; he had stated things he could not prove, even\r\nthough he knew they were true--but the Pope was his friend! He loved the\r\nChurch; he felt how necessary it was to the people, and at the last, the\r\ndesire of his heart was to bless and benefit the world.\r\n\r\nHe fell on his knees and attempted to kiss the Pope's foot, but the Holy\r\nFather offered him his hand instead, smiled on him, stroked his head,\r\nand an attendant was ordered to place about his neck a chain of gold\r\nwith a crucifix that would protect him from all harm. A purse was placed\r\nin his hand, and he was sent upon his way relieved, happy--wondering,\r\nwondering!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Copernicus reached his native town of Thorn, the local clergy\r\nturned out in a procession to greet him, and a solemn service of\r\nthanksgiving was held for his safe return home.\r\n\r\nCopernicus was only twenty-seven years of age, and what he had done was\r\nnot quite clear to his uncle, the bishop, and the other dignitaries, but\r\nword had come from the secretary of the Pope that he should be honored,\r\nand it was all so done, in faith, love and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nVery shortly after this Copernicus was made Canon of the Cathedral at\r\nFrauenburg. The town of Frauenburg has now only about twenty-five\r\nhundred people, and it certainly was no larger then. The place is slow,\r\nsleepy, and quite off the beaten track of travel.\r\n\r\nWhen Canon Copernicus preached now, it was to a dear, stupid lot of old\r\nmarketwomen and overworked men and mischievous children. Oratory is a\r\ncollaboration--let him wax eloquent about the precession of the\r\nequinoxes, and prate of Plato and Pythagoras if he wished--no one could\r\nunderstand him! Rome is wise--the crystallized experience of centuries\r\nis hers. Responsibility tames a man--marriage, political office,\r\nchurchly preferment--read history and note how these things have dulled\r\nthe bright blade of revolution and turned the radical into a\r\nPresbyterian professor at Princeton, a staunch upholder of the\r\nEstablished Order!\r\n\r\nPlato said that Solar Energy found one of its forms of expression in\r\nman. Some men are much more highly charged with it than others; your\r\ngenius is a man who does things. Do not think to dam up the red current\r\nof his life--he may die.\r\n\r\nCopernicus set to work practising medicine, and gave his services gratis\r\nto the poor, who came for many miles to consult him.\r\n\r\nHe went from house to house and ordered his people to clean up their\r\nback yards, to ventilate their houses, to bathe and be decent and\r\norderly. He devised a system of sewerage, and utilized the belfry of his\r\nchurch as a water-tower so as to get a water pressure from the little\r\nstream that ran near the town. The remains of this invention are to be\r\nseen there in the church-steeple even unto this day.\r\n\r\nKing Sigismund of Poland had heard of the attacks made by Copernicus\r\nupon the alchemists, and sent for him that he might profit by his\r\nadvice, for it seems that the King, too, had been having experience with\r\nalchemists. In their seeking after a way to make gold out of the baser\r\nmetals they had actually succeeded. At least they said so, and had made\r\nthe King believe it.\r\n\r\nThey had shown the King how he could cheapen his coinage one-half, and\r\n\"it was just as good!\" The King could not tell the difference when the\r\ncoins were new, but alas! when they went beyond the borders of Poland\r\nthey could only be passed at one-half their face-value; travelers\r\nrefused to accept them; and even the merchants at home were getting\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\nCopernicus analyzed some of this money made for the King by his\r\nalchemist friends and found a large alloy of tin, copper and zinc. He\r\nexplained to the King that by mixing the metals they did not change\r\ntheir nature nor value. Gold was gold, and copper was copper--God had\r\nmade these things and hid them in the earth and men might deceive some\r\nmen--a part of the time--but there was always a retribution. Debase your\r\ncurrency, and soon it will cease to pass current. No law can long uphold\r\na fictitious value.\r\n\r\nThe King urged Copernicus to write a book on the subject of coinage.\r\n\r\nThe permission of the Pope was secured, and the book written. The work\r\nis valuable yet, and reveals a deep insight into the heart of things.\r\nThe man knew political economy, and foretold that a people who debased\r\ntheir currency debased themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Money is character,\" he said, \"and if you pretend it is one thing, and\r\nit turns out to be another, you lose your reputation and your own\r\nself-respect. No government can afford to deceive the governed. If the\r\npeople lose confidence in their rulers, a new government will spring\r\ninto being, built upon the ruins of the old. Government and commerce are\r\nbuilt on confidence.\"\r\n\r\nThen he went on to show that German gold was valuable everywhere,\r\nbecause it was pure; but Polish gold and Russian gold were below par,\r\nbecause the money had been tampered with, and as no secrets could be\r\nkept long, the result was the matter exactly equalized itself, save that\r\nRussians and Polanders had in a large degree lost their characters\r\nthrough belief in miracles. Copernicus advocated a universal coinage, to\r\nbe adopted by all civilized nations, and the amount of alloy should be\r\nknown and plainly stated, and this alloy should simply be the\r\nseigniorage, or what was taken out to cover the cost of mintage.\r\n\r\nKing Sigismund circulated this valuable book by Copernicus among all the\r\ncourts of Europe, and it need not be stated that the suggestions made by\r\nCopernicus have been adopted by civilized nations everywhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe humdrum duties of a country clergyman did not still the intense\r\nlonging of Copernicus to know and understand the truth. He visited the\r\nsick, closed the eyes of the dying, kept his parish register, but his\r\nheart was in mathematics, and so there is shown at Thorn an old church\r\nregister kept by Copernicus, where, in the back, are great rows of\r\nfigures put down by the Master as he worked at some astronomical\r\nproblem. In the upper floor of the barn, back of the old dilapidated\r\nfarmhouse where he lived for forty years, he cut holes in the roof, and\r\nalso apertures in the sides of the building, through which he watched\r\nthe movements of the stars. He lived in practical isolation and exile,\r\nfor the Church had forbidden him to speak in public except upon themes\r\nthat the Holy Fathers in their wisdom had authorized. None was to invite\r\nhim to speak, read his writings or hold converse with him, except on\r\nstrictly church matters.\r\n\r\nCopernicus knew the situation--he was a watched man. For him there was\r\nno preferment: he knew too much! As long as he kept near home and did\r\nhis priestly work, all was well; but a trace of ambition or heresy, and\r\nhe would be dealt with. The Universities and all prominent Churchmen\r\nwere secretly ordered to leave Copernicus and his vagaries severely\r\nalone. But the stars were his companions--they came out for him nightly\r\nand moved in majesty across the sky. \"They do me great honor,\" he said;\r\n\"I am forbidden to converse with great men, but God has ordered for me a\r\nprocession.\" When the whole town slept, Copernicus watched the heavens,\r\nand made minute records of his observations. He had brought with him\r\nfrom Rome copies made by himself from the works of the prominent Greek\r\nastronomers, and the \"Almagest\" of Ptolemy he knew by heart.\r\n\r\nHe digested all that had been written on the subject of astronomy;\r\nslowly and patiently he tested every hypothesis with his rude and\r\nimprovised instruments. \"Surely God will not damn me for wanting to know\r\nthe truth about His glorious works,\" he used to say.\r\n\r\nEmerson once wrote this: \"If the stars came out but once in a thousand\r\nyears, how men would adore!\" But before he had written this, Copernicus\r\nhad said: \"To look up at the sky, and behold the wondrous works of God,\r\nmust make a man bow his head and heart in silence. I have thought and\r\nstudied, and worked for years, and I know so little--all I can do is to\r\nadore when I behold this unfailing regularity, this miraculous balance\r\nand perfect adaptation. The majesty of it all humbles me to the dust.\"\r\n\r\nIt was ostracism and exile that gave Copernicus the leisure to pursue\r\nhis studies in quiet, undiverted, undisturbed. He was relieved from\r\nfinancial pinch, having all he needed for his simple, homely wants. The\r\nmental distance that separated him from his parishioners made him free,\r\nand the order that he should not travel and that none should visit him\r\nmade him master of his time. There were no interruptions--\"God has set\r\nme apart,\" he wrote, \"that I may study and make plain His works.\" But\r\nstill, that he could not make his discoveries known was a constant,\r\nbitter disappointment to him.\r\n\r\nIn astronomy he found a means of using his mighty mathematical genius\r\nfor his own pleasure and amusement. The Pope had, in seeking to subdue\r\nhim, merely supplied the exact conditions he required to do his\r\nwork--yet neither knew it. So mighty is Destiny: we work for one thing\r\nand fail to get it, but in our efforts we find something better.\r\n\r\nThe simple, hard-working gardeners with whom Copernicus lived, had a\r\nreverent awe for the great man; they guessed his worth, but still had\r\nsuspicions of his sanity. His nightly vigils they took for a sort of\r\nreligious ecstasy, and a wholesome fear made them quite willing not to\r\ndo anything that might disturb him.\r\n\r\nSo passed the days away, and from a light-hearted, ambitious man,\r\nCopernicus had grown old and bowed, and nearly blind from constant\r\nwatching of the stars and writing at night.\r\n\r\nBut his book, \"The Revolution of the Heavenly Bodies,\" was at last\r\ncomplete. For forty years he had worked at it, and for twenty-seven\r\nyears, he himself says, not a day or a night had passed without his\r\nhaving added something to it.\r\n\r\nHe felt that he had in this book told the truth. If men wanted to know\r\nthe facts about the heavens they would find them here. He had approached\r\nthe subject with no preconceived ideas; he had ever been willing to\r\nrenounce a theory when he found it wrong. He knew what all other great\r\nastronomers had taught, and out of them all he had built a Science of\r\nAstronomy that he knew would stand secure.\r\n\r\nBut what should he do with all this mass of truth he had discovered? It\r\nwas in his own brain, and it was in the three thousand pages of this\r\nbook, which had been rewritten five times. In a few years at most, his\r\nbrain would be stilled in death; and in five minutes, ignorance and\r\nmalice might reduce the book to ashes, and the forty years' labor of\r\nCopernicus--working, dreaming, calculating, weeping, praying--would all\r\ngo for naught and be but a tale that is told. Others might have lived\r\nsuch lives and known as much as he, and all was lost!\r\n\r\nTo send the book frankly to Rome and ask the Censor for the privilege to\r\npublish it, was out of the question entirely--the request would be\r\nrefused, the manuscript destroyed, and his own life might be in danger.\r\n\r\nTo publish it at home without the consent of his Bishop would be equally\r\ndangerous. There would be a bonfire of every copy in the public square;\r\nfor in this volume, all that the priests taught of astronomy had been\r\ncontradicted and refuted.\r\n\r\nAnd then it occurred to him to send the manuscript to the free city of\r\nNuremberg, the home of science, art and free speech, where men could\r\nprint what they thought was truth--Nuremberg, the home of Albrecht\r\nDurer. With the book he sent a bag of gold, his savings of a lifetime,\r\nto pay the expense of printing the volume and putting it before the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nTo better protect himself, Copernicus wrote a preface, dedicating the\r\nbook to the Pope Paul, thus throwing himself upon the mercy of His\r\nHoliness. He would not put the work out anonymously, as his friends in\r\nNuremberg, for his own safety, had advised. And neither would he flee to\r\nNuremberg for protection; he would stay at home--he was too old to\r\ntravel now--besides, he had forgotten how to talk and act with men of\r\ntalent.\r\n\r\nHow would Rome receive the book? He could only guess--he could only\r\nguess.\r\n\r\nThe months went by, and fear, anxiety and suspense had their sway. He\r\nwas stricken with fever. In his delirium he called aloud, \"The\r\nbook--tell me--they surely have not burned it--you know I wrote no word\r\nbut truth--oh, how could they burn my book!\"\r\n\r\nBut on May Twenty-third, Fifteen Hundred Forty-three, a messenger came\r\nfrom Nuremberg.\r\n\r\nHe carried a copy of the printed book--he was admitted to the sick-room,\r\nand placed in the hands of the stricken man the volume. A gleam of\r\nsanity came to Copernicus. He smiled, and taking the book gazed upon it,\r\nstroked its cover as though caressing it, opened it and turned the\r\nleaves. Then closing the book and holding it to his heart, he closed his\r\neyes, and sank to sleep, to awake no more.\r\n\r\nHis body was buried with simple village honors, and laid to rest beneath\r\nthe floor of the Cathedral where he had so long ministered, side by side\r\nwith a long line of priests. On the little slab that marked his\r\nresting-place no mention was made of the mighty work he had done for\r\ntruth. There were fears that when the character of his book was known,\r\nthe grave of Copernicus would not remain undisturbed, and so the\r\ninscription on the headstone was simply this: \"I ask not the grace\r\naccorded to Paul; not that given to Peter; give me only the favor which\r\nThou didst show to the thief on the cross.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUMBOLDT]\r\n\r\nHUMBOLDT\r\n\r\n\r\n     The actual miracle of the Universe is the invariableness of Law.\r\n     Under like conditions a like result must follow, and upon this rock\r\n     is the faith of the Scientists built.\r\n\r\n     --_The Cosmos_\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMBOLDT\r\n\r\nThe Baron and Baroness von Hollwede were not happily married.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness had intellect, spirit, aspiration, with an appreciation of\r\nall that was best in art, music and the world of thought. As to the\r\nBaron, he had drunk life's wine to the lees and pronounced the draft\r\nbitter. He was a heavy dragoon with a soul for foxhounds. Later, when\r\ngout got to twinging him, he contented himself with cards and cronies.\r\n\r\nAnd then Destiny, like a novelist who does not know what to do with a\r\ncharacter, sent him on an excursion across the River Styx.\r\n\r\nThis was a good move all round, and the only accommodating action in\r\nwhich the Baron ever had a part. He left a large estate, not being able\r\nto take it along.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of widows, the bereaved and the relieved. In India\r\nno widow is allowed to remarry. The canons of the Episcopal Church\r\nforbid any widow or widower to remarry whose former partner is living. A\r\nmember of the Catholic Church who makes a marital mistake is not allowed\r\nto rectify it. Yet Nature, sometimes, as if to prove the foolishness of\r\nfearsome little man, justifies that of which man hotly disapproves.\r\n\r\nTo be a widow of thirty-six, fair of face and comely in form, to own a\r\nbeautiful home and have an income greater than you can spend, and still\r\nnot enough to burden you--what nobler ambition!\r\n\r\nThe Baroness had a little encumbrance--a son aged ten. I would like to\r\ntell of his career, but alas, of him history is silent, save that he was\r\nheir to some of his father's proclivities, grew up, became an army\r\nofficer and passed into obscurity in middle life, dishonored and unsung.\r\n\r\nSuch a widow as the Baroness von Hollwede is not apt to mourn for long.\r\nShe was courted by many, but it was Major Humboldt who found favor in\r\nher heart. I assume that all of my gentle readers have in them some of\r\nthe saltness of time, so that details may safely be omitted--let\r\nimagination bridge the interesting gap.\r\n\r\nThe Major was a few years younger than the lady, but like the gallant\r\ngentleman that he was, he swore i' faith before the notary that they\r\nwere of the same age, just as Robert Browning did when officially\r\ninterrogated as to the age of Elizabeth Barrett. Thomas Brackett Reed\r\navowed that no gentleman ever weighed over two hundred pounds, and I\r\nalso maintain no gentleman ever married a woman older than himself.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Major Humboldt and the Baroness von Hollwede was a most\r\nhappy mating that fully justified the venture. The Major had done his\r\nwork bravely in the Seven Years' War, and was now an attache of the\r\nKing's Court--a man of means, of intellect, and of many strong and\r\nbeautiful virtues. After the marriage he became known as Baron von\r\nHumboldt, and as to just how he succeeded to the noble title let us not\r\nbe curious--his wife undoubtedly bestowed it on him, good and generous\r\nwoman that she was.\r\n\r\nThey lived in the romantic Castle Tegel, near Berlin, and separated from\r\nthe city by a park, where the dark pines still tower aloft and murmur\r\ntheir secrets to the night breeze.\r\n\r\nTegel is a most beautiful place; it was first a hunting-lodge occupied\r\nby Frederick the Great. It is shut out from the world by its high stone\r\nwalls; and in its dim, dense woods, one might easily imagine he was far\r\nindeed from the madding crowd.\r\n\r\nHere there were two sons born to the Baron and Baroness--two years\r\napart. One of these sons sleeps now beneath the turret where he first\r\nsaw the light, and from which he made others see the light as long as he\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nIn Goethe's \"Faust\" is an allusion to a mysterious legend that had its\r\nrise in storied Tegel. On May Eighteenth, in the year Seventeen Hundred\r\nSeventy-eight. Goethe came here, walking over from Berlin, dined, and\r\nwalked on to Potsdam. But before he left he saw two beautiful boys, aged\r\neight and ten, playing beneath the spreading Tegel trees. The boys\r\nremembered the event and wrote of it in their journal, mentioning the\r\nkindly pats on their heads and the prophecy that they would grow up and\r\nbe great men.\r\n\r\nGoethe was always patting boys on the head and saying graceful things,\r\nand it is doubtful whether his prophecy was more than a mere\r\ncommonplace. But Goethe always claimed it was divine prophecy. These\r\nboys were William and Alexander von Humboldt.\r\n\r\nHistory does not supply another instance of two brothers attaining the\r\nintellectual height reached by Alexander and William von Humboldt. This\r\nbeing so, it seems meet that we should tarry a little to inspect the\r\nmethod adopted in the education of these boys--something that the\r\neducated world for the most part has not done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis world of ours, round like an orange and slightly flattened at the\r\npoles, has produced only five men who were educated. Of course all\r\neducation is comparative; but these five are so beyond the rest of\r\nmankind that they form a class by themselves.\r\n\r\nAn educated man means a developed man--a man rounded on every side of\r\nhis nature. We are aware of no limit to which the mind of man may\r\nevolve; other men may appear who will surpass the Immortal Five, but\r\nthis fact remains: none that we know have. Great men, so-called, are\r\nusually specialists: clever actors, individuals with a knack, talented\r\ncomedians--who preach, carve, paint, orate, fight, manipulate, manage,\r\nteach, write, perform, coerce, bribe, hypnotize, accomplish, and get\r\nresults. There are great financiers, sea-captains, mathematicians,\r\nfootball players, engineers, bishops, wrestlers, runners, boxers, and\r\nplayers on zithern-strings. But these are not necessarily very great\r\nmen, any more than poets, painters and pianists, with wonderful hirsute\r\neffects and strange haberdashery are great men.\r\n\r\nFor it is intellect and emotion expanded in every direction that give\r\nthe true title to greatness. Judged in this way, how rare is the\r\neducated man--five in six thousand years! And yet one of these five\r\neducated men had a brother nearly as great as he.\r\n\r\nAlexander von Humboldt was past fifty before the world of thinking men\r\nrealized that he had outstripped his brother William--and Alexander\r\nwould never admit he had.\r\n\r\nThese two men, handsome in face, form and feature: strong in body and\r\npoised in mind, with souls athirst to realize and to know--happy men,\r\nliving long lives of useful effort--surely should be classed as educated\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nAnd in passing, let us note that all education is preparatory--it is\r\nlife that gives the finals, not the college. The education of the von\r\nHumboldt boys was the Natural Method--the method advocated by\r\nRousseau--the education by play and work so combined that study never\r\nbecomes irksome nor work repulsive. Rousseau said, \"Make a task\r\nrepugnant and the worker will forever quit it as soon as the pressure\r\nthat holds him to it is removed.\"\r\n\r\nThe parents of Alexander and William von Humboldt carefully studied the\r\nnew plan of education that was at that time being advocated by some of\r\nthe best professors at Berlin. \"A child must have a teacher,\" said Jean\r\nJacques, \"but a professional teacher is apt to become the slave of his\r\nprofession, and when this occurs he has separated himself from life, and\r\ntherefore to that degree is unfitted to teach.\"\r\n\r\nA school should not be a preparation for life: a school should be life.\r\nThe Kindergarten Idea, among other things, suggests that a child should\r\nnever know he is in school.\r\n\r\nThe discipline is kept out of sight, and the youngster finds himself a\r\npart of the busy life. He blends in with the others, and works, plays\r\nand sings under the wise and loving care of his \"other mother,\" the\r\nteacher. He is living, not simply preparing to live. All life should be\r\njoyous, spontaneous, natural. The Rousseau Idea, which was modified and\r\nrefined by Froebel, is the utilization of the propensity to play.\r\n\r\nMajor von Humboldt found a man who was saturated with the true Froebel\r\nspirit, although this was before Froebel was born.\r\n\r\nThe man's name was Heinrich Campe. Heinrich was hired to superintend the\r\neducation of the Humboldt boys. That is to say, he was to become\r\ncomrade, friend, counselor, fellow-scholar, playmate and teacher.\r\n\r\nPlay needs direction as well as work. Campe played with the boys. They\r\nlived with Nature--made lists of all the trees at Tegel, drew sketches\r\nof the leaves and fruit, calculated the height of trees, measured them\r\nat the base, and cut them down occasionally, first sitting in judgment\r\non the case, and deciding why a certain tree should be removed, thus\r\ngetting a lesson in scientific forestry.\r\n\r\nThey became acquainted with the bugs, beetles, birds and squirrels. They\r\ncared for the horses, cattle and fowls, and best of all they learned to\r\nwait on themselves.\r\n\r\nCampe told them tales of history--of Achilles, Pericles and Cæsar. Then\r\nthey studied Greek, that they might read of Athens in the language of\r\nthe men who made Athens great. They translated \"Robinson Crusoe\" into\r\nthe German language, and Campe's translation of \"Robinson Crusoe\" is\r\ntoday a German classic. It was all natural--interesting, easy. The day\r\nwas filled with work and play, and joyous tales of what had been said by\r\nothers in days agone.\r\n\r\n\"Teach only what you know, and never that which you merely believe,\"\r\nsaid Rousseau.\r\n\r\nThere is still a cry that religion should be taught in the public\r\nschools. If we ask, \"What religion?\" the answer is, \"Ours, of course!\"\r\n\r\nReligious dogma, being a matter of belief, was taught to the Humboldts\r\nas a part of history.\r\n\r\nSo these boys very early became acquainted with the dogmas of\r\nConfucianism, Mohammedanism, Christianity. They separated, compared and\r\nanalyzed, and saw for themselves that dogmatic religions were all much\r\nalike. To know all religions is to escape slavery to any. In studying\r\nthe development of races these boys saw that a certain type of religion\r\nfits a certain man in a certain stage of his evolution, and so perhaps\r\nto that degree religion is necessary. An ethnologist is never a Corner\r\nGrocery Infidel. The C.G.I. is very apt to be converted at the first\r\nrevival, outrivaling all other \"seekers,\" and when warm weather comes,\r\nfalling from grace and dropping easily into scofferdom.\r\n\r\nThe Humboldts, like Thoreau, never had any quarrel with God, and they\r\nwere never tempted to go forward to the Mourners' Bench.\r\n\r\nOrigin and destiny did not trouble them; predestination and\r\njustification by faith were not even in their curriculum; foreordination\r\nand baptism were to them problems not to be taken seriously.\r\n\r\nBy studying religions in groups and incidentally, they learned to\r\ndistinguish the fetish in each. They read Greek mythology side by side\r\nwith Judean mythology and noted similarities. The intent of Tutor Campe\r\nwas to give these boys a scientific education. Science is only\r\nclassified commonsense. To be truly scientific is to know\r\ndifferences--to distinguish between this and that. Every successful\r\nfarmer has traveled a long way into science, for science deals with the\r\nmaintenance of life. To know soils, animals and vegetation is to be\r\nscientific.\r\n\r\nBut when the average farmer learns to transmute compost into grass and\r\ngrain, and these into beef, he usually stops, content. To be a scientist\r\nin the true sense, one must love knowledge for its own sake, and not\r\nmerely for what it will bring on market-day, and so the Humboldts were\r\nled on through the stage of wanting to make money, to the stage of\r\nwanting to know the why and wherefore. It will be seen that the\r\neducation of the Humboldts was what the Boylston Professor of English at\r\nHarvard calls \"faddism, or the successful effort at flabbiness.\" Our\r\nHarvard friend thinks that education should be a discipline--that it\r\nshould be difficult and vexatious, and that happiness, spontaneity and\r\nexuberance are the antitheses and the foes of learning. To him grim\r\nearnestness, silence, sweat and lamp-smoke are preferable to sunshine\r\nand joyous, useful work so wisely directed that the pupil thinks it\r\nplay. He believes that to be sincere we must be serious. In these\r\nlatter-day objections there is nothing new. Socrates met them all;\r\nRousseau heard the cry of \"fad\"; Heyne, Pestalozzi, Campe, Knuth and\r\nFroebel met the carpist and answered him reason for reason, just as\r\nCopernicus, Bruno and Galileo told the reason the earth revolved. The\r\nprofessional teacher who can do nothing but teach--the college professor\r\nwho is a college professor and nothing else--hates the Natural Method\r\nman about as ardently as the person who wears a paste diamond hates the\r\nlapidary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHeinrich Campe was the tutor of the Humboldts for two years, when he\r\nentered the employ of the King as Commissioner of Education.\r\n\r\nAfter this, however, he continued to spend one day a week at Tegel for\r\nsome time. He loved the boys as his own, and his hope for their future\r\nnever relaxed. Possibly his interest was not wholly disinterested--with\r\nthe help of these lads he was working out and proving his pedagogic\r\ntheories.\r\n\r\nWhen Campe resigned his immediate tutorship he was allowed to select his\r\nsuccessor, and he chose a young man by the name of Christian Knuth.\r\n\r\nThe mother was a member of this little university of four persons;\r\nKnuth, of course, was a member, for he always considered himself more of\r\na student than a teacher.\r\n\r\nWhen Campe resigned in favor of Knuth his action was in degree prompted\r\nby his love and consideration for the boys. Knuth was only a little past\r\ntwenty, and was able to enter into the out-of-door sports and work of\r\nthe youngsters better than the older man. Knuth was their hero--together\r\nthey rode horseback, climbed mountains, excavated tunnels, mined for\r\nore, built miniature houses. \"Knuth made every good thing in Berlin\r\navailable to us,\" wrote William years afterward; \"we visited stores,\r\nfactories, barracks and schools, and became familiar with a thousand\r\ncommonplace things never taught in schools and colleges.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander was twelve years old, the father died. This would have\r\nbeen a severe blow to the boys were it not for Knuth, who seemed to\r\nstand to them more as the real parent than did Major von Humboldt.\r\n\r\nKnuth was a businessman of no mean ability. The Baroness now trusted him\r\nwith all her financial affairs. He called on the boys to help him in the\r\ndetails of business, so the keeping of accounts and the economical\r\nhandling of money were lessons they learned early in life.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander was seventeen and William nineteen, the mother and Knuth\r\ndecided that the boys should have the advantages of university life.\r\nAccordingly they were duly entered at the University of Frankfort as\r\n\"special students.\"\r\n\r\nKnuth also entered as a student in the class with them. Special\r\nstudents, let it be known, are usually those who have failed to pass the\r\nrequired examinations. In this instance, Alexander and William were\r\nbeyond many of their classmates in some things, but in others they were\r\ndeficient. Especially had their education in the dead languages been\r\n\"neglected,\" so it is quite likely they could not have passed the\r\nexaminations had they attempted it.\r\n\r\nIt should also be explained that special students are not eligible to\r\ndiplomas or degrees.\r\n\r\nBut Campe and Knuth did not believe the nerve-racking plan of\r\nexaminations wise, any more than it is wisdom to pull up a plant and\r\nexamine the roots to see how it prospers. Neither did they prize a\r\ncollege degree.\r\n\r\nThey knew full well that a college degree is no proof of excellence of\r\ncharacter; to them a degree was too cheap a thing to deviate in one's\r\norbit to secure. They were after bigger game.\r\n\r\nAt Frankfort, Knuth and his charges lived in the family of Professor\r\nLoffler, \"so as to rub off a little knowledge from this learned man.\"\r\nThey studied history, philosophy, law, political economy and natural\r\nhistory. We would say their method was desultory, were it not for the\r\nfact that they were always thorough in all that they undertook. They\r\nwere simply three boys together, intent on getting their money's worth.\r\n\r\nWilliam was a little better student than Alexander, and was the leader;\r\nhe was larger in stature and seemed to have more vitality.\r\n\r\nTwo years were spent at the University of Frankfort, and then our trio\r\nmoved on to the University of Gottingen, where there were distinguished\r\nlecturers on Natural History and Archeology. Antiquity especially\r\ninterested the boys, and the evolution and history of races were\r\nfollowed with animation.\r\n\r\nWilliam took especially to philosophy as expressed in the writings of\r\nKant, while Alexander developed a love for botany and what he called\r\n\"the science of out-of-doors.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years at Gottingen, following the bent of their minds and listening\r\nonly to those lectures they liked, and they moved on to Jena.\r\n\r\nHere they were in the Goethe country. Soon there were overtures from\r\nBerlin that they enter the service of the Government. These overtures\r\nwere set in motion by Campe, who, however, kept out of sight in the\r\nmatter, and when accused, stoutly declared that it was every man's duty\r\nto help himself, and that he personally had never helped any one get a\r\nposition and never would.\r\n\r\nWilliam was twenty-three and Alexander twenty-one. William was gracious\r\nand graceful in manner and made himself at home in the best society;\r\nAlexander was studious, reserved and inclined to be shy.\r\n\r\nAn invitation came that they should visit Weimar and spend some weeks in\r\nthat little world of art and letters created by Goethe and Schiller. To\r\nWilliam this was very tempting; but Alexander saw at Weimar scant\r\nopportunity to study botany and geology.\r\n\r\nBesides that, he felt that sooner or later he would drift into the\r\nemploy of the Government, following in his father's footsteps. His\r\nambition was practical mining, with a taste for finance.\r\n\r\nThe brothers kissed each other good-by, and one went to Weimar to assist\r\nSchiller in editing a magazine that did not pay expenses, to bask in the\r\nsunshine of the great Goethe, and incidentally to secure a wife.\r\n\r\nThe other started on a geological excursion, and this excursion was to\r\ncontinue through life, and make of the man the greatest naturalist that\r\nthe world had seen since Aristotle lived, two thousand years before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHumboldt's first book was on the geological formation of the Rhine,\r\npublished when he was twenty-six years old. The work was so complete and\r\npainstaking that it led to his being appointed to the position of\r\n\"Assessor of Mines\" at Berlin. This was the same office that Swedenborg\r\nonce held in Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of our social-science friends, it is rather interesting\r\nto note that at this time in Europe nearly all mines belonged to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAn individual might own the surface, and up to the sky, but his claim\r\ndid not go to the center of the earth. Iron, coal, copper, silver and\r\ngold were largely mined, and the Government operated the mines direct,\r\nor else leased them on a percentage.\r\n\r\nI am told that in America all mining is done by individuals or private\r\ncompanies, and that four-fifths of all mining companies have no mines at\r\nall--merely samples of ores, blueprints, photographs and prospects. The\r\ngenus promoter is a very modern production, and is a creation Humboldt\r\nnever knew; the \"salting\" of mines was out of his province, and mining\r\noperations carried on exclusively in sky-scrapers was a combination he\r\nnever guessed.\r\n\r\nWhether society will ever take a turn backward, and the whole people own\r\nand control the treasures deposited by Nature in the earth, is a\r\nquestion I will leave to my Marxian colleagues to determine.\r\n\r\nAs a mine-manager Humboldt was hardly a success. He knew the value of\r\nores, utilized various by-products that had formerly been thrown away,\r\nmade plans for the betterment of his workers, and once sent a protest to\r\nthe King against allowing women and children to be employed underground.\r\n\r\nBut the price per ton of his product was out of proportion to the\r\nexpenses. While other men mined the ore he wrote a book on \"Subterranean\r\nVegetation.\" The details of business were not to his liking. His own\r\nprivate financial affairs were now turned over to Knuth, his modest\r\nfortune resolved into cash and invested in bonds that brought a low rate\r\nof interest. Freedom was his passion--to come and go at will was his\r\ndesire. The thirst for travel was upon him--travel, not for adventure,\r\nbut for knowledge.\r\n\r\nHe resigned his office and tramped with knapsack on back across the\r\nAlps. The habit of his mind was that of the naturalist-investigator.\r\nGeology, botany and zoology were his properties by divine right.\r\n\r\nThese sciences really form one--geognosy, or the science of the\r\nformation of the earth. The plants dissolve and disintegrate the rocks;\r\nthe animal feeds upon the plants; and animal life makes new forms of\r\nvegetation possible. So the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms\r\nevolve together, constantly tending toward a greater degree of\r\nrefinement and complexity.\r\n\r\nThe very highest form of animal life is man; and the highest type of\r\nman is evolved where there is a proper balance between the animal and\r\nthe vegetable kingdoms.\r\n\r\nHumboldt discovered very early in his career that the finest flowers\r\ngrow where there are the finest birds, and man separated from birds,\r\nbeasts and flowers could not possibly survive.\r\n\r\nJust about this time, Humboldt, taking the cue from Goethe, said: \"Man\r\nis a product of soil and climate, and is brother to the rocks, trees and\r\nanimals. He is dependent on these, and all things seem to point to the\r\ntruth that he has evolved from them. The accounts of special creation\r\nare interesting as archeology, but biology is distinctly the business of\r\nmodern scientists. The scientist tells what he knows, and the theologist\r\nwhat he believes.\" And again we find Humboldt writing from Switzerland\r\nin Seventeen Hundred Ninety-six, making observations that have been\r\nrecently unconsciously paraphrased by the United States Secretary of\r\nAgriculture, who said in a printed report: \"Western farmers who raise\r\nand sell hogs and cattle, feeding them grain instead of selling it, are\r\nsure to acquire a competence. The farmers who sell grain are the ones\r\nwho do not pay off their mortgages.\"\r\n\r\nSays Humboldt:\r\n\r\n\"Here on the sides of these towering and forbidding mountains we find\r\nthe most fertile and beautiful miniature farms, nestling in little\r\nvalleys or on plateaus.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, I heard today of a man falling out of his farm and being\r\nseriously injured. He ventured too near the edge.\r\n\r\n\"These Swiss gardens with their prosperous and intelligent owners are\r\nonly possible through the fact that the owners keep all the cows and\r\npoultry that can comfortably exist on the acres. The peasants sell\r\nbutter, cheese and eggs, instead of grain and vegetables exclusively.\r\n\r\n\"They give back to the earth all that they take from it, so in the\r\ncourse of a hundred years a fine soil evolves that supports valuable\r\nanimals, including valuable men; choice fruit, flowers and birds appear,\r\nand we have what we are pleased to call Christian civilization. It is\r\nnot for me to quibble about terms, but civilization is not necessarily\r\nChristian, since it is more a matter of economics and natural science\r\nthan religion.\"\r\n\r\nWhere the climate is fairly propitious, but not so much so but that it\r\ncompels watchfulness, economy and effort, man will work, and to aid him\r\nin his work he utilizes domestic animals. And the very act of\r\ndomesticating the animal domesticates the man. As man improves the\r\nanimal, he improves himself. One reason why the American Indian did not\r\nprogress was because he had neither horses, camels, oxen, swine nor\r\npoultry. He had his dog, and the dog is a wolf, and always remains one,\r\nin that his intent is on prey. This fitted the mood of the Indian, and\r\nhe continued to live his predaceous career without a particle of\r\nevolution. To stand still is to retreat, and there is evidence that long\r\nbefore the year Fourteen Hundred Ninety-two, there was a North American\r\nIndian that was a better Indian than the Indians who watched the\r\napproach of Columbus and exclaimed, \"Alas! we are discovered!\"\r\n\r\nIn crossing the Alps, Humboldt was impressed with the truth that man was\r\na necessary factor in working out \"creation,\" just as much as the\r\nearthworm. When men stir the soil so as to make it produce grain that\r\nthe family may be fed, and utilize animals in this work, civilization is\r\nsurely at hand.\r\n\r\nNations with a controlling desire to absorb, annex and exploit are still\r\nto that degree savages. Creation is still going on, and this earth is\r\nbecoming better and more beautiful as men work in line with reason and\r\nallow science to become the handmaid of instinct.\r\n\r\nHumboldt, above all men, prepared the way for Darwin, Spencer and\r\nTyndall--all of these built on him, all quote him. His books form a mine\r\nin which they constantly delved.\r\n\r\nHumboldt in boyhood formed the habit of close and accurate observation,\r\nand he traveled that he might gratify this controlling impulse of his\r\nlife--the habit of seeing and knowing. His genius for classification was\r\nsuperb; he approached every subject with an open mind, willing to change\r\nhis conclusions if it were shown that he was wrong; he had imagination\r\nto see the thing first with his inward eye; he had the strength to\r\nendure physical discomfort, and finally he had money enough so he was\r\nfree to follow his bent.\r\n\r\nThese qualifications made him the prince of scientific travelers--the\r\npioneer of close, accurate and reliable explorers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore Humboldt's time travelers had been mostly of the type of Marco\r\nPolo and Sir John Mandeville, who discovered strange and wondrous\r\nthings, such as horses with five legs, dogs that could talk, and\r\nanthropophagi with heads that grew beneath their shoulders. The\r\ntemptation to be interesting at the expense of truth has always been\r\nstrong upon the sailorman. Read even the history of Christopher Columbus\r\nand you will hear of islands off the coast of America inhabited\r\nexclusively by women who had only one calling-day in a year when their\r\ngentlemen friends from a neighboring island came to see them.\r\n\r\nThe world needed accurate, scientific knowledge concerning those parts\r\nof the world seldom visited by man. Travel a hundred years ago was\r\naccompanied by great expense and more or less peril. Nations held\r\nthemselves aloof from one another, and travelers were looked upon as\r\nrenegades or spies.\r\n\r\nAlexander von Humboldt had explored deep mines, climbed high mountains,\r\nvisited that strange people, the Basques of Spain, got little glimpses\r\ninto Africa where the jungle was waiting for a Livingstone and a Stanley\r\nbefore giving up its secrets. The Corsican had thrown Europe into a\r\nfever of fear, and war was on in every direction, when in Seventeen\r\nHundred Ninety-nine Humboldt ran the blockade and sailed out of the\r\nharbor of Coruna, Spain, on the little corvette \"Pizarro,\" bound for\r\nthe Spanish possessions in the New World. Spain had discovered America\r\nin the gross two hundred years before, but what this country really\r\ncontained in way of possibilities, Spain had most certainly never\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nHumboldt's mind had conceived the idea of a Scientific Survey, and in\r\nthis he was the maker of an epoch. In this undertaking he secured the\r\nassistance of the Prime Minister, who secretly issued passports and\r\nletters of recommendation to Humboldt, first cautioning him that if the\r\nCourt of Madrid should know anything about this proposed voyage of\r\ndiscovery it could never be made, so jealous and ignorant were the\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nOnly one thing did Spain have in abundance, and that was religion.\r\n\r\nAt that time the Spanish Colonies included Louisiana, Florida, Texas,\r\nCalifornia, Mexico, Cuba, Central America, most of the West Indies, and\r\nmost of South America, not to mention the Philippines. These colonies\r\ncovered a territory stretching over five thousand miles from North to\r\nSouth. Twice a year Spain sent out her trading-ships, convoyed by armed\r\ncruisers. Trade then was monopoly and extortion. The goods sent out were\r\nas cheap and tawdry as could be palmed off; all that were brought back\r\nwere bartered for at the lowest possible prices.\r\n\r\nCheating in count, weight and quality was then considered perfectly\r\nproper, and as the Government officials at home got a goodly grab into\r\nall transactions in way of perquisites, all went swimmingly--or fairly\r\nso.\r\n\r\nFor a Spaniard to trade with any other nation was treason, and if\r\ncaught, his property was confiscated and probably his head forfeited.\r\n\r\nNo foreigners were allowed in the colonies, and exclusion was the rule.\r\nTo hold her dependencies Spain thought she must keep them under close\r\nsubjection; and she seemed beautifully innocent of the fact that she was\r\nthe dependent, not they. She did not believe in Free Trade.\r\n\r\nThe Government was absolutely under military rule. Of the botany,\r\nzoology, geology, not to mention the topography, of her American\r\npossessions, the officials of Spain knew nothing save from the tales of\r\nsailors.\r\n\r\nSuch were the Spanish conditions when Humboldt got himself smuggled on\r\nboard the \"Pizarro,\" and sailed away, June Fourth, Seventeen Hundred\r\nNinety-nine. With Humboldt was one companion, Bonpland, a Swiss by\r\nbirth, and a rare soul.\r\n\r\nHumboldt was a naturalist and a philosopher; by nature he was a\r\ntraveler. But he lacked that intrepid quality possessed by, say, Lewis\r\nand Clarke.\r\n\r\nHe had too much brain--too fine a nerve-quality to face the forest\r\nalone. Bonpland made good all that he lacked. He used to call Bonpland\r\nhis \"Treasure.\" And surely such a friend is a treasure, indeed.\r\nBonpland was a linguist, as most of the Swiss are. He was a\r\nmountain-climber, and had been a soldier and a sailor, and he knew\r\nenough of literature and science, so he was an interesting companion.\r\n\r\nHe was small in stature, lithe, immensely strong, absolutely fearless,\r\nand had left behind him neither family nor friends to mourn his loss. To\r\nHumboldt he was guide, teacher, protector and friend. Bonpland was the\r\nsoul of unselfishness.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a certain quality of man attracts a certain quality of friend--I\r\nreally am not sure. But this I know, that while Alexander von Humboldt\r\nhad few personal friends, he always had just those which his nature\r\nrequired--his friends were hands, feet, eyes and ears for him, to quote\r\nhis own words. This voyage on the \"Pizarro\" occupied five years. The\r\ntravelers visited Teneriffe, Cuba, Mexico, and skirted the coast of\r\nSouth America, making many little journeys inland.\r\n\r\nThey climbed mountains that had never been scaled before; they ascended\r\nrivers where no white man had ever been, and pushed their way through\r\njungle and forest to visit savage tribes who fled before them in terror\r\nthinking they were gods. On the return trip they visited the United\r\nStates; spent some weeks in Washington, where they were the guests of\r\nthe President, Thomas Jefferson. A firm friendship sprang up between\r\nHumboldt and Jefferson: they were both freethinkers, and when Humboldt\r\nrecorded in his journal that Jefferson was by far the greatest man\r\nliving in America, he not only recorded his personal conviction, but he\r\nspoke the truth.\r\n\r\nAnd as if not to be outdone, although he did not then know what Humboldt\r\nhad said of him, Jefferson declared that Alexander von Humboldt was the\r\ngreatest man he ever saw.\r\n\r\nMost of the vast number of rare specimens and natural-history\r\ncuriosities gathered by Humboldt and Bonpland were placed on a\r\nhomeward-bound ship that sailed from South America. This ship was lost\r\nand all the precious and priceless cargo went for naught. Had Humboldt\r\nand his companion sailed on this ship, as they had at first intended,\r\ninstead of returning by way of the United States, the world would not\r\nhave known the name of Alexander von Humboldt.\r\n\r\nBut Fate for once was kind--the world had great need of him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Humboldt landed at Bordeaux in August, in Eighteen Hundred Four,\r\nafter his five-year journey, he immediately set out to visit his\r\nbrother, who was then German Ambassador at Rome. We can imagine that it\r\nwas a most joyous meeting.\r\n\r\nOf it William said: \"I could not recognize him for my tears--but beside\r\nthis he seemed to have grown in stature and was as brown as a Malay. Was\r\nhe really my brother? Ah, the hand was the hand of Esau, but when he\r\nspoke, it was the same kind, gentle, loving voice--the voice of my\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks at Rome and Alexander grew restless for work. He had made\r\ngreat plans about publishing the record of his travels. This work was to\r\noutstrip anything in bookmaking the world had ever seen, dealing with\r\nsimilar subjects. The writing was done on shipboard, by campfires, and\r\nin forest and jungle, but now it had all to be gone over and revised and\r\nmuch of it translated into French, for the original notes were sometimes\r\nin English and sometimes in German. Only in Paris could the work of\r\nbookmaking be done that would fill Humboldt's ideals. In Paris were\r\nprinters, engravers, artists, binders--Paris was then the artistic\r\ncenter of the world, as it is today.\r\n\r\nThe results of this first great scientific voyage of discovery were\r\nwritten out in a work of seventeen volumes.\r\n\r\nIt was entitled, \"The Travels of Humboldt and Bonpland in the Interior\r\nof America.\" Humboldt wrote the book, but wanted his friend to have half\r\nthe credit. This superb set of books, containing many engravings, was\r\nissued under Humboldt's supervision and almost entirely at his own\r\nexpense. It was divided into five general parts: Zoology and Comparative\r\nAnatomy; Geography and the Distribution of Plants; Political Essays and\r\nDescription of Peoples and Institutions in the Kingdom of New Spain;\r\nAstronomy and Magnetism; Equinoctial Vegetation. It took two years to\r\nissue the first volume, but the others then came along more rapidly, yet\r\nit was ten years before the last book of the set was published. The\r\ntotal expense of issuing this set of books was more than a million\r\nfrancs, or, to be exact, two hundred twenty-six thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe cost of a set of these books to subscribers was two thousand five\r\nhundred fifty dollars, although there were a few sets containing\r\nhand-colored plates and original drawings that were valued at twenty\r\nthousand dollars. One such set can now be seen at the British Museum. In\r\nall, only three hundred sets of these books were issued.\r\n\r\nOne set at least came to North America, for it was presented to Thomas\r\nJefferson, and, if I am not mistaken, is now in the Congressional\r\nLibrary at Washington.\r\n\r\nThis American Expedition forever fixed Alexander von Humboldt's place in\r\nhistory, but after it was completed and the record written out, he had\r\nstill more than half a century to live.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt a time when few men could afford the luxury, Alexander von Humboldt\r\nwas an atheist. Fortunately he had sufficient fortune to place him\r\nbeyond reach of the bread-and-butter problem, and all of his books were\r\nwritten in the language of the esoteric. He did not serve as an\r\niconoclast for the common people--his name was never on the tongue of\r\nrumor--very few, indeed, knew of his existence. His books were issued in\r\ndeluxe, limited editions, and were for public libraries, the shelves of\r\nnobility or rich collectors.\r\n\r\nHumboldt was judicial in all of his statements, approaching every\r\nquestion as if nothing were known about it. He built strong, and was\r\npreparing the way, such as throwing up ramparts and storing ammunition\r\nfor the first decisive battle that was to take place between Theology\r\nand Science.\r\n\r\nIn his day Theology was supreme, the practical dictator of human\r\nliberties. But a World's Congress of Freethinkers has recently been held\r\nin Rome.\r\n\r\nThere were present more than three thousand delegates, representing\r\nevery civilized country on the globe. The deliberations of the Congress\r\nwere held in a hall supplied by the Italian Government, and all\r\ncourtesies and privileges were tendered the delegates. The only protest\r\ncame from the Pope, who turned Protestant and in all the Catholic\r\nchurches in Rome ordered special services, to partially mitigate the\r\nblot upon the fair record of the \"Holy City.\" Forty years ago armed men\r\nwould have routed this Congress by force, and a hundred years ago the\r\nbare thought of such a meeting would have placed a person who might have\r\nsuggested it in imminent peril.\r\n\r\nHumboldt prophesied that the world would not forever be ruled by\r\nreligious superstition--that science must surely win. But he did not\r\nexpect that the change would come as quickly as it has; neither did he\r\nanticipate the fact that the orthodox religion would admit all the facts\r\nof science and still flourish. The number of Church communicants now is\r\nlarger than it was in the time of Humboldt. The Church is a\r\ndepartment-store that puts in the particular goods that the people ask\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nFreethinkers do not leave the Church; the Church is built on a Goodyear\r\npatent, and its lines expand when Freethinkers get numerous, so as to\r\ninclude them.\r\n\r\nThe Church would rather countenance vice, as it has in the past, than\r\ndisband. In New York City we now have the spectacle of the Church\r\noperating a saloon and selling strong drink. In all country towns,\r\nreligion, failing in being attractive, has, to keep churches alive,\r\nresorted to raffles, lotteries, concerts, chicken-pie socials, and\r\nlectures and exhortations by strange men in curious and unique garb, and\r\nsingers of reputation.\r\n\r\nThe Church, being a part of society, evolves as society evolves.\r\nChristianity is a totally different thing now from what it was in\r\nHumboldt's time; it was a different thing in Humboldt's time from what\r\nit was a hundred years before.\r\n\r\nBehold the spectacle of a thousand highly educated and gentle men, from\r\nall over the world, decorating with garlands the statue of Bruno in\r\nRome, on the site where Churchmen piled high the fagots and burned his\r\nliving body! I foretell that when the next World's Congress of\r\nFreethinkers occurs in Rome, the Pope will welcome the delegates, and\r\ntheir deliberations will occur by invitation in the wide basilica of\r\nSaint Peter's. The world moves, and the Pope and all the rest of us move\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nWhen a meeting was recently called in Jersey City to welcome Turner, the\r\nso-called anarchist, the Mayor forbade the meeting and then placed a\r\ncordon of policemen around the intended meeting-place. But, lo, in their\r\nextremity the \"anarchists\" were invited by a clergyman to come and use\r\nhis church and he led the way to the sacred edifice, warning the police\r\nto neither follow nor enter. As we become better we meet better\r\npreachers.\r\n\r\nHumboldt could see no rift through the clouds outside of the death of\r\nthe Church and the disbanding of her so-called sacred institutions. We\r\nnow perceive that very rarely are religious opinions consciously\r\nabandoned; they change, are modified and later evolve into something\r\nelse. Churches are now largely social clubs. In America this is true\r\nboth of Catholic and of Protestant. Most all denominations are\r\ninterested in social betterment, because the trend of human thought is\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\nThe Church is being swept along upon the tide of time. In a few\r\ninstances churches have already evolved practical industrial\r\nbetterments, which are conducted directly under the supervision of the\r\nchurch and in its edifice. There are hundreds of Kindergartens now being\r\ncarried on in church buildings that a few years ago were idle and vacant\r\nall the week. Others have sewing-circles and boys' clubs, and these have\r\nmetamorphosed in some instances into Manual-Training Schools where girls\r\nare taught Domestic Science and boys are given instruction in the\r\nHandicrafts. I know a church that derives its support from the sale of\r\nuseful things that are made by its members and workers under the\r\nsupervision of its pastor, who is a master in handicraft. So this pretty\r\nnearly points the ideal--a church that has evolved into an ethical and\r\nindustrial college, where the pastor is not paid for preaching, but for\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nCharles Bradlaugh once said:\r\n\r\n\"A paid priesthood blocks evolution. These men are really educated to\r\nuphold and defend the institution. They can do nothing else. Most of\r\nthem have families dependent upon them--do you wonder that it is a fight\r\nto the death? It is not truth that the clergy struggles for--they may\r\nthink it is--but the grim fact remains, it is a fight for material\r\nexistence.\"\r\n\r\nWe all confuse our interests with the eternal verities--the thing that\r\npays us we consider righteous, or at least justifiable. This is the most\r\nnatural thing in the world. An artist who painted very bad pictures once\r\ntook one of his canvases to Whistler for criticism.\r\n\r\nJimmy shrugged his shoulders and made a grimace that spoke volumes. \"But\r\na man must live some way!\" pleaded the poor fellow in his extremity.\r\n\r\n\"I do not see the necessity,\" was the weary reply.\r\n\r\nPreachers must live; their education and environment have unfitted them\r\nfor useful effort; but they are a part of the great, seething struggle\r\nfor existence. And so we have their piteous and plaintive plea for the\r\nobsolete and the outworn. Disraeli once in an incautious moment\r\nexclaimed: \"If we do away with the Established Church, what is to become\r\nof the fourteen million prepared and pickled sermons? Think for a moment\r\nof the infinite labor of writing new sermons, all based upon a different\r\npoint of view--let us then be reasonable and not subject a profession\r\nthat is overworked to the humiliation of destroying the bulk of its\r\nassets.\"\r\n\r\nScience deals directly with the maintenance of human life and the\r\nbettering of every condition of existence through a wider, wiser and\r\nsaner use of the world. Civilization is the working out and\r\ncomprehending and proving how to live in the best way. Theology\r\nprepares men to die; science fits them to live.\r\n\r\nScience deals with your welfare in this world; theology in another.\r\nTheology has not yet proved that there is another world--its claims are\r\nnot even based upon hearsay. It is a matter of belief and assumption.\r\n\r\nScience, too, assumes, and its assumption is this: The best preparation\r\nfor a life to come is to live here and now as if there were no life to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nYour belief will not fix your place in another world--what you are, may.\r\nThe individual who gets most out of this life is fitting himself to get\r\nmost out of another if there is one.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings us up to that paragraph in the \"Cosmos\" where Humboldt\r\nsays: \"I perceive a period when the true priesthood will not be paid to\r\ndefend a fixed system of so-called crystallized truth. But I believe the\r\ntime will come when that man will be most revered who bestows most\r\nbenefits here and now. The clergy of Christendom have stood as leaders\r\nof thought, but to hold this proud position they must abandon the\r\nintangible and devote themselves to this world and the people who are\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMost of Humboldt's time during his middle life was spent at Paris, where\r\nhe was busily engaged in the herculean task of issuing his splendid\r\nbooks. He varied his work, however, so that several hours daily were\r\ndevoted to study and scientific research; and from time to time he made\r\njourneys over Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nIn Eighteen Hundred Twenty-seven a personal request came from the King\r\nof Prussia that Humboldt should thereafter make Berlin his home. He was\r\ntoo big a man for Germany to lose.\r\n\r\nHe acceded to the King's request, moved to Berlin and was spoken of as\r\n\"The First Citizen,\" although he would not consent to hold office, nor\r\nwould he accept a title.\r\n\r\nIn vexed questions of diplomacy he was often consulted by the King and\r\nhis Cabinet, and in a great many ways he furthered the interests of\r\neducation and civilization by his judicial and timely advice.\r\n\r\nHe was always a student, always an investigator, always a tireless\r\nworker. He lived simply and quietly--keeping out of society and away\r\nfrom crowds, except on the rare occasions when necessity seemed to\r\ndemand it.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the man was well mirrored in those magnificent books--all\r\nthat he did was on the scale of grandeur.\r\n\r\nHis books were too high in price for the average reader, but on request\r\nof the King he consented to give a course of five, free, popular\r\nlectures for the people.\r\n\r\nNo one foresaw the result of these addresses. The course was so\r\nsuccessful that it extended itself into sixty-one lectures, and covered\r\na period of more than ten years' time. No admittance was charged, free\r\ntickets being given out to applicants. Very soon after the first\r\nlecture, a traffic sprang up in these free tickets, carried on by our\r\nSemitic friends, and the tickets soared to as high as three dollars\r\neach. Then the strong hand of the Government stepped in: the tickets\r\nwere canceled, and the public was admitted to the lectures without\r\nceremony. Boxes, however, were set apart for royalty and foreign\r\nvisitors, some of whom came from England, Belgium, Switzerland and\r\nFrance. The size of these audiences was limited simply by the capacity\r\nof the auditorium, the attendance at first being about a thousand;\r\nlater, a larger hall was secured and the attendance ran as high as four\r\nthousand persons at each address.\r\n\r\nThe subjects were as follows: three lectures on the History of Science;\r\ntwo on reasons why we should study Science; four on the Crust of the\r\nEarth, and the nature of Volcanoes and Earthquakes; two on the form of\r\nEarth's Surface and the elevation of the Continents; five on Physical\r\nGeography; five on the nature of Heat and Magnetism; sixteen on\r\nAstronomy; two on Mountains and how they are formed; three on the Nature\r\nof the Sea; three on the Distribution of Matter; ten on the Atmosphere\r\nas an Elastic Fluid; three on the Geography of Animals; three on Races\r\nof Men.\r\n\r\nEvery good thing begins as something else, and what was intended for the\r\ncommon people became scientific lectures for educated people. \"The man\r\nwho was most benefited by these lectures was myself,\" said Humboldt.\r\n\r\nMen grow by doing things. Lectures are for the lecturer.\r\n\r\nHumboldt found out more things in giving these lectures than he knew\r\nbefore--he discovered himself. And long before they were completed he\r\nknew that his best work was embodied right here--in doing for others he\r\nhad done for himself.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to reveal the Universe or \"Cosmos,\" he revealed most of\r\nhis own comprehensive intelligence. That many of his conclusions have\r\nsince been abandoned by the scientific world does not prove such ideas\r\nvalueless--they helped and are helping men to find the truth.\r\n\r\nThese sixty-one \"popular\" and free lectures make up that stupendous work\r\nnow known to us as \"Humboldt's Cosmos.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSays Robert Ingersoll in his tribute to Alexander von Humboldt:\r\n\r\n\"His life was pure, his aims were lofty, his learning varied and\r\nprofound, and his achievements vast.\r\n\r\n\"We honor him because he has ennobled our race, because he has\r\ncontributed as much as any man, living or dead, to the real prosperity\r\nof the world. We honor him because he has honored us--because he has\r\nlabored for others--because he was the most learned man of the most\r\nlearned nation of his time--because he left a legacy of glory to every\r\nhuman being. For these reasons he is honored throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\"Millions are doing homage to his genius at this moment, and millions\r\nare pronouncing his name with reverence and recounting what he\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\"We associate the name of Humboldt with oceans, continents, mountains,\r\nvolcanoes--with towering palms--the snow-lipped craters of the\r\nAndes--the wide deserts--with primeval forests and European\r\ncapitals--with wilderness and universities--with savages and\r\nsavants--with the lonely rivers of unpeopled wastes--with peaks, pampas,\r\nsteppes, cliffs and crags--with the progress of the world--with every\r\nscience known to man and with every star glittering in the immensity of\r\nspace. Humboldt adopted none of the soul-shrinking creeds of his day; he\r\nwasted none of his time in the inanities, stupidities and contradictions\r\nof theological metaphysics; he did not endeavor to harmonize the\r\nastronomy and geology of a barbarous people with the science of the\r\nNineteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\"Never, for one moment, did he abandon the sublime standard of truth: he\r\ninvestigated, he studied, he thought, he separated the gold from the\r\ndross in the crucible of his brain. He was never found on his knees\r\nbefore the altar of superstition. He stood erect by the tranquil column\r\nof Reason. He was an admirer, a lover, an adorer of Nature, and at the\r\nage of ninety, bowed by the weight of nearly a century, covered with the\r\ninsignia of honor, loved by a nation, respected by a world, with kings\r\nfor his servants, he laid his weary head upon her bosom--upon the bosom\r\nof the Universal Mother--and with her loving arms about him, sank into\r\nthat slumber which we call Death.\r\n\r\n\"History added another name to the starry scroll of the immortals.\r\n\r\n\"The world is his monument; upon the eternal granite of her hills he\r\ninscribed his name, and there, upon everlasting stone, his genius wrote\r\nthis, the sublimest of truths: The universe is governed by law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM HERSCHEL]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HERSCHEL\r\n\r\n\r\n     The great number of alterations of stars that we are certain have\r\n     happened within the last two centuries, and the much greater number\r\n     that we have reason to suspect to have taken place, are curious\r\n     features in the history of the heavens, as curious as the slow\r\n     wearing away of the landmarks of our earth on mountains, on river\r\n     banks, on ocean shores. If we consider how little attention has\r\n     formerly been paid this subject, and that most of the observations\r\n     we have are of a very late date, it would perhaps not appear\r\n     extraordinary were we to admit the number of alterations that have\r\n     probably happened to different stars, within our own time, to be a\r\n     hundred.\r\n\r\n     --_William Herschel_\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HERSCHEL\r\n\r\nWilliam Herschell, born Seventeen Hundred Thirty-eight, in the city\r\nof Hanover, was the fourth child in a family of ten. Big families, I am\r\ntold, usually live in little houses, while little families live in big\r\nhouses. The Herschels were no exception to the rule.\r\n\r\nIsaac Herschel, known to the world as being the father of his son, was a\r\npoor man, depending for support upon his meager salary as bandmaster to\r\na regiment of the Hanoverian Guards.\r\n\r\nAt the garrison school, taught by a retired captain, William was the\r\nstar scholar. In mathematics he propounded problems that made the worthy\r\ncaptain pooh-pooh and change the subject.\r\n\r\nAt fourteen, he was playing a hautboy in his father's band and\r\npractising on the violin at spare times.\r\n\r\nFor music he had a veritable passion, and to have a passion for a thing\r\nmeans that you excel in it--excellence is a matter of intensity. One of\r\nthe players in the band was a Frenchman, and William made an arrangement\r\nto give the \"parlez vous\" lessons on the violin as payment for lessons\r\nin French.\r\n\r\nThis whole brood of Herschel children was musical, and very early in\r\nlife the young Herschels became self-supporting as singers and players.\r\n\"It is the only thing they can do,\" their father said. But his loins\r\nwere wiser than his head.\r\n\r\nIn Seventeen Hundred Fifty-five William accompanied his father's band to\r\nEngland, where they went to take part in a demonstration in honor of a\r\nHanoverian, one George the Third, who later was to play a necessary part\r\nin a symphony that was to edify the American Colonies. America owes much\r\nto George the Third.\r\n\r\nYoung Herschel had already learned to speak English, just as he had\r\nlearned French. In England he spent all the money he had for three\r\nvolumes of \"Locke on the Human Understanding.\"\r\n\r\nThese books were to remain his lifelong possession and to be passed on,\r\nwell-thumbed, to his son more than half a century later.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the breaking out of the Seven Years' War, William\r\nHerschel was nineteen. His regiment had been ordered to march in a week.\r\nHere was a pivotal point--should he go and fight for the glory of\r\nPrussia?\r\n\r\nNot he--by the connivance of his mother and sisters, he was secreted on\r\na trading-sloop bound for England. This is what is called desertion; and\r\njust how the young man evaded the penalties, since the King of England\r\nwas also Elector of Hanover, I do not know, but the House of Hanover\r\nmade no effort toward punishment of the culprit, even when the facts\r\nwere known.\r\n\r\nMusicians of quality were, perhaps, needed in England; and as\r\nsheep-stealing is looked upon lightly by priests who love mutton, so do\r\nkings forgive infractions if they need the man.\r\n\r\nWhen William Herschel landed at Dover he had in his pocket a single\r\ncrownpiece, and his luggage consisted of the clothes he wore, and a\r\nviolin. The violin secured him board and lodgings along the road as he\r\nwalked to London, just as Oliver Goldsmith paid his way with a similar\r\nlegal tender.\r\n\r\nIn London, Herschel's musical skill quickly got him an engagement at one\r\nof the theaters. In a few months we hear of his playing solos at\r\nBrabandt's aristocratic concerts. Little journeys into \"the provinces\"\r\nwere taken by the orchestra to which Herschel belonged. Among other\r\nplaces visited was Bath, and here the troupe was booked for a two-weeks'\r\nengagement. At this time Bath was run wide open.\r\n\r\nBath was a rendezvous for the gouty dignitaries of Church and State who\r\nhad grown swag through sloth and much travel by the gorge route. There\r\nwere ministers of state, soldiers, admirals-of-the-sea, promoters,\r\npreachers, philosophers, players, poets, polite gamblers and buffoons.\r\n\r\nThey idled, fiddled, danced, gabbled, gadded and gossiped. The \"School\r\nfor Scandal\" was written on the spot, with models drawn from life. It\r\nwasn't a play--it was a cross-section of Bath Society.\r\n\r\nBath was a clearing-house for the wit, learning and folly of all\r\nEngland--the combined Hot Springs, Coney Island, Saratoga and Old Point\r\nComfort of the Kingdom. The most costly church of its size in America is\r\nat Saint Augustine, Florida. The repentant ones patronize it in Lent;\r\nthe rest of the year it is closed.\r\n\r\nAt Bath there was the Octagon Chapel, which had the best pipe-organ in\r\nEngland. Herschel played the organ: where he learned how nobody seemed\r\nto know--he himself did not know. But playing musical instruments is a\r\nlittle like learning a new language.\r\n\r\nA man who speaks three languages can take a day off and learn a fourth\r\nalmost any time. Somebody has said that there is really only one\r\nlanguage, and most of us have only a dialect. Acquire three languages\r\nand you perceive that there is a universal basis upon which the various\r\ntongues are built.\r\n\r\nHerschel could play the hautboy, the violin and the harpsichord. The\r\norgan came easy. When he played the organ in the Chapel at Bath, fair\r\nladies forgot the Pump-Room, and the gallants followed them--naturally.\r\nHerschel became the rage. He was a handsome fellow, with a pride so\r\nsupreme that it completed the circle, and people called it humility. He\r\ntalked but little, and made himself scarce--a point every genius should\r\nponder well.\r\n\r\nThe disarming of the populace--confiscating canes, umbrellas and\r\nparasols--before allowing people to enter an art-gallery is necessary;\r\nalthough it is a peculiar comment on humanity to think people have a\r\ntendency to smite, punch, prod and poke beautiful things. The same\r\npropensity manifests itself in wishing to fumble a genius. Get your\r\ncoarse hands on Richard Mansfield if you can! Corral Maude\r\nAdams--hardly. To do big things, to create, breaks down tissue awfully,\r\nand to mix it with society and still do big things for society is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nAt Bath, Herschel was never seen in the Pump-Room, nor on the North\r\nParade. People who saw him paid for the privilege. \"In England about\r\nthis time look out for a shower of genius,\" the almanackers might have\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nTo Bath came two Irishmen, Edmund Burke and Richard Brinsley Sheridan.\r\nBurke rented rooms of Doctor Nugent, and married the doctor's daughter,\r\nand never regretted it. Sheridan also married a Bath girl, but added the\r\nright touch of romance by keeping the matter secret, with the intent\r\nthat if either party wished to back out of the agreement it would be\r\nallowed. This was quite Irish-like, since according to English Law a\r\nmarriage is a marriage until Limbus congeals and is used for a\r\nskating-rink.\r\n\r\nWith the true spirit of chivalry, Sheridan left the questions of\r\npublicity or secrecy to his wife: she could have her freedom if she\r\nwished. He was a fledgling barrister, with his future in front of him,\r\nthe child of \"strolling players\"; she, the beautiful Miss Linlay, was a\r\nsinger of note. Her father was the leader of the Bath Orchestra, and had\r\na School of Oratory where young people agitated the atmosphere in\r\norotund and tremolo and made the ether vibrate in glee. Doctor Linlay's\r\ndaughter was his finest pupil, and with her were elucidated all his\r\ntheories concerning the Sixteen Perspective Laws of Art. She also proved\r\na few points in stirpiculture. She was a most beautiful girl of\r\nseventeen when Richard Brinsley Sheridan led her to the altar, or I\r\nshould say to a Dissenting Pastor's back door by night. She could sing,\r\nrecite, act, and impersonate in pantomime and Greek gown, the passions\r\nof Fear, Hate, Supplication, Horror, Revenge, Jealousy, Rage and Faith.\r\n\r\nRomney moved down to Bath just so as to have Miss Linlay and Lady\r\nHamilton for models. He posed Miss Linlay as the Madonna, Beulah, Rena,\r\nRuth, Miriam and Cecilia; and Lady Hamilton for Susannah at the Bath,\r\nAlicia and Andromache, and also had her illustrate the Virtues, Graces,\r\nFates and Passions.\r\n\r\nWhen the beautiful Miss Linlay, the pride and pet of Bath, got ready to\r\nannounce her marriage, she did it by simply changing the inscription\r\nbeneath a Romney portrait that hung in the anteroom of the artist's\r\nstudio, marking out the words \"Miss Linlay,\" and writing over it, \"Mrs.\r\nRichard Brinsley Sheridan.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bath porchers who looked after other people's business, having none\r\nof their own, burbled and chortled like siphons of soda, and the marvel\r\nto all was that such a brilliant girl should thus throw herself away on\r\na sprig of the law. \"He acts, too, I believe,\" said Goldsmith to Doctor\r\nJohnson.\r\n\r\nAnd Doctor Johnson said, \"Sir, he does nothing else,\" thus anticipating\r\nJames McNeil Whistler by more than a hundred years.\r\n\r\nBut alas for the luckless Linlay, the Delsarte of his day, poor man! he\r\nused words not to be found in Johnson's Dictionary, and outdid Cassius\r\nin the quarrel-scene to the Brutus of Richard Brinsley.\r\n\r\nBut very soon things settled down--they always do when mixed with\r\ntime--and all were happy, or reasonably so, forever after.\r\n\r\nHerschel resigned from Brabandt's Orchestra and remained in Bath. He\r\ntaught music, played the organ, became first violinist for Professor\r\nLinlay and later led the orchestra when Linlay was on the road starring\r\nthe one-night stands and his beautiful daughter.\r\n\r\nThings seemed to prosper with the kindly and talented German. He was\r\nreserved, intellectual, and was respected by the best. He was making\r\nmoney--not as London brokers might count money, but prosperous for a\r\nmere music-teacher.\r\n\r\nAnd so there came a day when he bought out the school of Professor\r\nLinlay, and became proprietor and leader of the famous Bath Orchestra.\r\n\r\nBut the talented Mrs. Richard Brinsley Sheridan was sorely missed--a\r\nwoman soloist of worth was needed.\r\n\r\nHerschel thought and pondered. He tried candidates from London and a few\r\nfrom Paris. Some had voices, but no intellect. A very few had intellect,\r\nbut were without voice. Some thought they had a voice when what they had\r\nwas a disease. Other voices he tried and found guilty.\r\n\r\nThose who had voice and spirit had tempers like a tornado.\r\n\r\nHerschel decided to educate a soloist and assistant. To marry a woman\r\nfor the sake of educating her was risky business--he knew of men who had\r\ntried it--for men have tried it since the time of the Cavemen.\r\n\r\nA bright thought came to him! He would go back to Deutschland and get\r\none of his sisters, and bring her over to England to help him do his\r\nwork--just the very thing!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a most fortunate stroke for Herschel when he went back home to\r\nget one of his sisters to come over into Macedonia and help him. No man\r\never did a great work unless he was backed up by a good woman. There\r\nwere five of these Herschel girls--three were married, so they were out\r\nof the question, and another was engaged. This left Caroline as first,\r\nlast and only choice. Caroline was twenty-two and could sing a little.\r\n\r\nShe had appeared in concerts for her father when a child. But when the\r\nfather died, the girl was set to work in a dressmaking and millinery\r\nshop, to help support the big family. The mother didn't believe that\r\nwomen should be educated--it unfitted them for domesticity, and to speak\r\nof a woman as educated was to suggest that she was a poor housekeeper.\r\n\r\nIn Greece of old, educated women were spoken of as \"companions\"--and\r\nthis meant that they were not what you would call respectable. They were\r\nthe intellectual companions of men. The Greek term of disrespect carried\r\nwith it a trifle of a suggestion not intended, that is, that women who\r\nwere not educated--not intellectual--were really not companionable--but\r\nlet that pass. It is curious how this idea that a woman is only a\r\nscullion and a drudge has permeated society until even the women\r\nthemselves partake of the prejudice against themselves.\r\n\r\nMother Herschel didn't want her daughters to become educated, nor study\r\nthe science of music nor the science of anything. A goodly grocer of the\r\nDutch School had been picked out as a husband for Caroline, and now if\r\nshe went away her prospects were ruined--Ach, Mein Gott! or words to\r\nthat effect. And it was only on William's promise to pay the mother a\r\nweekly sum equal to the wages that Caroline received in the\r\ndressmaking-shop that she gave consent to her daughter's going. Caroline\r\narrived in England, wearing wooden shoon and hoops that were exceeding\r\nDutch, but without a word of English. In order to be of positive use to\r\nher brother, she must acquire English and be able to sing--not only sing\r\nwell, but remarkably well. In less than a year she was singing solo\r\nparts at her brother's concerts, to the great delight of the aristocrats\r\nof Bath.\r\n\r\nThey heard her sing, but they did not take her captive and submerge her\r\nin their fashionable follies as they would have liked to do.\r\n\r\nThe sister and the brother kept close to their own rooms. Caroline was\r\nthe housekeeper, and took a pride in being able to dispense with all\r\noutside help. She was small in figure, petite, face plain but full of\r\nanimation. All of her spare time she devoted to her music. After the\r\nconcerts she and her brother would leave the theater, change their\r\nclothes and then walk off into the country, getting back as late as one\r\nor two o'clock in the morning. On these midnight walks they used to\r\nstudy the stars and talk of the wonderful work of Kepler and Copernicus.\r\nThere were various requests that Caroline should go to London and sing,\r\nbut she steadfastly refused to appear on a stage except where her\r\nbrother led the orchestra. About this time Caroline wrote a letter home,\r\nwhich missive, by the way, is still in existence, in which she says:\r\n\"William goes to bed early when there are no concerts or rehearsals. He\r\nhas a bowl of milk on the stand beside him, and he reads Smith's\r\n'Harmonics' and Ferguson's 'Astronomy.' I sit sewing in the next room,\r\nand occasionally he will call to me to listen while he reads some\r\npassage that most pleases him. So he goes to sleep buried beneath his\r\nfavorite authors, and his first thought in the morning is how to obtain\r\ninstruments so we can study the harmonics of the sky.\" And a way was to\r\nopen: they were to make their own telescopes--what larks! Brother and\r\nsister set to work studying the laws of optics. In a secondhand store\r\nthey found a small Gregorian reflector which had an aperture of about\r\ntwo inches.\r\n\r\nThis gave them a little peep into the heavens, but was really only a\r\ntantalization.\r\n\r\nThey set to work making a telescope-tube out of pasteboard. It was about\r\neighteen feet long, and the \"board\" was made in the genuine pasteboard\r\nway--by pasting sheet after sheet of paper together until the substance\r\nwas as thick and solid as a board.\r\n\r\nSo this brother and sister worked at all odd hours pasting sheet after\r\nsheet of paper--old letters, old books--with occasional strips of cloth\r\nto give extra strength. Lenses were bought in London, and at last our\r\nprecious musical pair, with astronomy for their fad, had the\r\nsatisfaction of getting a view of Saturn that showed the rings.\r\n\r\nIt need not be explained that astronomical observations must be made out\r\nof doors. Further, the whole telescope must be out of doors so as to get\r\nan even temperature. This is a fact that the excellent astronomers of\r\nthe Mikado of Japan did not know until very recently. It seems they\r\nconstructed a costly telescope and housed it in a costly\r\nobservatory-house, with an aperture barely large enough for the big\r\ntelescope to be pointed out at the heavens. Inside, the astronomer had a\r\ncomfortable fire, for the season was then Winter and the weather cold.\r\nBut the wise man could see nothing and the belief was getting abroad\r\nthat the machine was bewitched, or that their Yankee brothers had\r\nlawsonized the buyers, when our own David P. Todd, of Amherst, happened\r\nalong and informed them that the heat-waves which arose from their warm\r\nroom caused a perturbation in the atmosphere which made star-gazing\r\nimpossible. At once they made their house over, with openings so as to\r\ninsure an even temperature, and Prince Fusiyama Noguchi wrote to\r\nProfessor Todd, making him a Knight of the Golden Dragon on special\r\norder of the heaven-born Mikado.\r\n\r\nThe Herschels knew enough of the laws of heat and refraction to realize\r\nthey must have an even temperature, but they forgot that pasteboard was\r\nporous.\r\n\r\nOne night they left their telescope out of doors, and a sudden shower\r\ntransformed the straight tube into the arc of a circle. All attempts to\r\nstraighten it were vain, so they took out the lenses and went to work\r\nmaking a tube of copper. In this, brother, sister and genius--which is\r\nconcentration and perseverance--united to overcome the innate meanness\r\nof animate and inanimate things. A failure was not a failure to them--it\r\nwas an opportunity to meet a difficulty and overcome it.\r\n\r\nThe partial success of the new telescope aroused the brother and the\r\nsister to fresh exertions. The work had been begun as a mere\r\nrecreation--a rest from the exactions of the public which they diverted\r\nand amused with their warblings, concussions and vibrations.\r\n\r\nThey were still amateur astronomers, and the thought that they\r\nwould ever be anything else had not come to them. But they wanted\r\nto get a better view of the heavens--a view through a Newtonian\r\nreflecting-telescope. So they counted up their savings and decided that\r\nif they could get some instrument-maker in London to make them a\r\nreflecting-telescope six feet long, they would be perfectly willing to\r\npay him fifty pounds for it. This study of the skies was their only form\r\nof dissipation, and even if it was a little expensive it enabled them to\r\nescape the Pump-Room rabble and flee boredom and introspection. A hunt\r\nwas taken through London, but no one could be found who would make such\r\nan instrument as they wanted for the price they could afford to pay.\r\nThey found, however, an amateur lens-polisher who offered to sell his\r\ntools, materials and instruments for a small sum. After consultation,\r\nthe brother and sister bought him out. So at the price they expected to\r\npay for a telescope they had a machine-shop on their hands.\r\n\r\nThe work of grinding and polishing lenses is a most delicate business.\r\nOnly a person of infinite patience and persistency can succeed at it.\r\n\r\nIn Allegheny, Pennsylvania, lives John Brashear, who, by his own\r\nefforts, assisted by a noble wife, graduated from a rolling-mill and\r\nbecame a maker of telescopes.\r\n\r\nBrashear is practically the one telescope lens-maker of America since\r\nAlvan Clark resigned. There is no competition in this line--the\r\ndifficulties are too appalling for the average man. The slightest\r\naccident or an unseen flaw, and the work of months or years goes into\r\nthe dustbin of time, and all must be gone over again.\r\n\r\nSo when we think of this brother and sister sailing away upon an unknown\r\nocean--working day after day, night after night, week after week, and\r\nmonth after month, discarding scores of specula which they had worked\r\nupon many weary hours in order to get the glass that would serve their\r\npurpose--we must remove our hats in reverence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGod sends great men in groups. From Seventeen Hundred Forty for the next\r\nthirty-five years the intellectual sky seemed full of shooting-stars.\r\nWatt had watched to a purpose his mother's teakettle; Boston Harbor was\r\ntransformed into another kind of Hyson dish; Franklin had been busy with\r\nkite and key; Gibbon was writing his \"Decline and Fall\"; Fate was\r\npitting the Pitts against Fox; Hume was challenging worshipers of a\r\nFetish and supplying arguments still bright with use; Voltaire and\r\nRousseau were preparing the way for Madame Guillotine; Horace Walpole\r\nwas printing marvelous books at his private press at Strawberry Hill;\r\nSheridan was writing autobiographical comedies; David Garrick was\r\nmimicking his way to immortality; Gainsborough was working the\r\napotheosis of a hat; Reynolds, Lawrence, Romney, and West, the American,\r\nwere forming an English School of Art; George Washington and George the\r\nThird were linking their names preparatory to sending them down the\r\nages; Boswell was penning undying gossip; Blackstone was writing his\r\n\"Commentaries\" for legal lights unborn; Thomas Paine was getting his\r\nname on the blacklist of orthodoxy; Burke, the Irishman, was polishing\r\nhis brogue so that he might be known as England's greatest orator; the\r\nlittle Corsican was dreaming dreams of conquest; Wellesley was having\r\npresentiments of coming difficulties; Goldsmith was giving dinners with\r\nbailiffs for servants; Hastings was defending a suit where the chief\r\nparticipants were to die before a verdict was rendered; Captain Cook was\r\ngiving to this world new lands; while William Herschel and his sister\r\nwere showing the world still other worlds, till then unknown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the brother and sister had followed the subject of astronomy as far\r\nas Ferguson had followed it, and knew all that he knew, they thought\r\nthey surely would be content.\r\n\r\nProgress depends upon continually being dissatisfied. Now Ferguson\r\naggravated them by his limitations.\r\n\r\nIn their music they amused, animated and inspired the fashionable\r\nidlers.\r\n\r\nWilliam gave lessons to his private pupils, led his orchestra, played\r\nthe organ and harpsichord, and managed to make ends meet, and would have\r\ngotten reasonably rich had he not invested his spare cash in lenses,\r\nbrass tubes, eyepieces, specula and other such trifles, and stood most\r\nof the night out on the lawn peering at the sky.\r\n\r\nHe had been studying stars for seven years before the Bath that he\r\namused awoke to the fact that there was a genius among them. And this\r\ngenius was not the idolized Beau Nash whose statue adorned the\r\nPump-Room! No, it was the man whose back they saw at the concerts.\r\n\r\nDuring all these years Herschel had worked alone, and he had scarcely\r\never mentioned the subject of astronomy with any one save his sister.\r\n\r\nOne night, however, he had moved his telescope into the middle of the\r\nstreet to get away from the shadows of the houses. A doctor who had been\r\nout to answer a midnight call stopped at the unusual sight and asked if\r\nhe might look through the instrument.\r\n\r\nPermission was courteously granted. The next day the doctor called on\r\nthe astronomer to thank him for the privilege of looking through a\r\nbetter telescope than his own. The doctor was Sir William Watson, an\r\namateur astronomer and all-round scientist, and member of the Royal\r\nSociety of London.\r\n\r\nHerschel had held himself high--he had not gossiped of his work with the\r\npopulace, cheapening his thought by diluting it for cheap people. Watson\r\nsaw that Herschel, working alone, isolated, had surpassed the schools.\r\n\r\nThere is a nugget of wisdom in Ibsen's remark, \"The strongest man is he\r\nwho stands alone,\" and Kipling's paraphrase, \"He travels the fastest who\r\ntravels alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe chance acquaintance of Herschel and Watson soon ripened into a very\r\nwarm friendship.\r\n\r\nHerschel amused the neurotics, Watson dosed and blistered them--both for\r\na consideration. Each had a beautiful contempt for the society they\r\nserved. Watson's father was of the purple, while Herschel's was of the\r\npeople, but both men belonged to the aristocracy of intellect. Watson\r\nintroduced Herschel into the select scientific circle of London, where\r\nhis fine reserve and dignity made their due impress. Herschel's first\r\npaper to the Royal Society, presented by Doctor Watson, was on the\r\nperiodical star in Collo Ceti. The members of the Society, always very\r\njealous and suspicious of outsiders, saw they had a thinker to deal\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nSome one carried the news to Bath--a great astronomer was now among\r\nthem! About this time Horace Walpole said, \"Mr. Herschel will content me\r\nif, instead of a million worlds, he can discover me thirteen colonies\r\nwell inhabited by men and women, and can annex them to the Crown of\r\nGreat Britain in lieu of those it has lost beyond the Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\nBath society now took up astronomy as a fad, and fashionable ladies\r\nnamed the planets both backward and forward from a blackboard list set\r\nup in the Pump-House by Fanny Burney, the clever one.\r\n\r\nHerschel was invited to give popular lectures on the music of the\r\nspheres. Herschel's music-parlors were besieged by good people who\r\nwanted to make engagements with him to look through his telescope.\r\n\r\nOne good woman gave the year, month, day, hour and minute of her birth\r\nand wanted her fortune told. Poor Herschel declined, saying he knew\r\nnothing of astronomy, but could give her lessons in music if desired.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the law of supply and demand, thus proving the efficacy of\r\nprayer, an itinerant astronomer came down from London and set up a\r\nfive-foot telescope on the Parade and solicited the curious ones at a\r\ntuppence a peep. This itinerant interested the populace by telling them\r\na few stories about the stars that were not recorded in Ferguson, and\r\npassed out his cards showing where he could be consulted as a\r\nfortune-teller during the day. Herschel was once passing by this street\r\nastronomer, who was crying his wares, and a sudden impulse coming over\r\nhim to see how bad the man's lens might be, he stopped to take a peep at\r\nEarth's satellite. He handed out the usual tuppence, but the owner of\r\nthe telescope loftily passed it back saying, \"I takes no fee from a\r\nfellow-philosopher!\"\r\n\r\nThis story went the rounds, and when it reached London it had been\r\namended thus: Charles Fox was taking a ramble at Bath, ran across\r\nWilliam Herschel at work, and mistaking him for an itinerant, the great\r\nstatesman stopped, peeped through the aperture, and then passing out a\r\ntuppence moved along blissfully unaware of his error, for Herschel being\r\na perfect gentleman would not embarrass the great man by refusing his\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\nWhen Herschel was asked if the story was true he denied the whole\r\nfabric, which the knowing ones said was further proof of his gentlemanly\r\ninstincts--for a true gentleman will always lie under two conditions:\r\nfirst, to save a woman's honor; and second, to save a friend from\r\nembarrassment. As a profession, astrology has proved a better investment\r\nthan astronomy. Astronomy has nothing to offer but abstract truth, and\r\nthose who love astronomy must do so for truth's sake.\r\n\r\nAstronomical discoveries can not be covered by copyright or patent, nor\r\ncan any new worlds be claimed as private property and financed by stock\r\ncompanies, frenzied or otherwise. Astrology, on the other hand, relates\r\nto love-affairs, vital statistics, goldmines, misplaced jewels and lost\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\nYet, in this year of grace, Nineteen Hundred Five, Boston newspapers\r\ncarry a column devoted to announcements of astrologers, while the\r\nCambridge Astronomical Observatory never gets so much as a mention from\r\none year's end to the other. Besides that, astronomers have to be\r\nsupported by endowment--mendicancy--while astrologers are paid for their\r\nprophecies by the people whose destinies they invent. This shows us how\r\nfar as a nation we have traveled on the stony road of Science.\r\n\r\nScience, forsooth? Oh, yes, of course--science--bang! bang! bang!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, in Seventeen Hundred Ninety-one, Herschel, by the\r\ndiscovery of Uranus, found his place as a fixed star among the world's\r\ngreat astronomers. Years before this, William and Caroline had figured\r\nit out that there must be another planet in our system in order to\r\naccount plausibly for the peculiar ellipses of the others. That is to\r\nsay, they felt the influence of this seventh planet; its attractive\r\nforce was realized, but where it was they could not tell. Its discovery\r\nby Herschel was quite accidental. He was sweeping the heavens for comets\r\nwhen this star came within his vision. Others had seen it, too, but had\r\nclassified it as \"a vagrant fixed star.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the work of Herschel to discover that it was not a fixed star,\r\nbut had a defined and distinct orbit that could be calculated. To look\r\nup at the heavens and pick out a star that could only be seen with a\r\ntelescope--pick it out of millions and ascertain its movement--seems\r\nlike finding the proverbial needle in a haystack.\r\n\r\nThe present method of finding asteroids and comets by means of\r\nphotography is simple and easy. The plate is exposed in a frame that\r\nmoves by clockwork with the earth, so as to keep the same field of stars\r\nsteady on the glass. After two, three or four hours' exposure, the\r\nphotograph will show the fixed stars, but the planets, asteroids and\r\ncomets will reveal themselves as a white streak of light, showing\r\nplainly where the sitters moved.\r\n\r\nHerschel had to watch each particular star in person, whereas the\r\nphotographic lens will watch a thousand.\r\n\r\nHow close and persistent an observer a man must be who, watching one\r\nstar at a time, discovers the one in a million that moves, is apparent.\r\nChance, surely, must also come to his aid and rescue if he succeeds.\r\n\r\nHerschel found his moving star, and at first mistook it for a comet.\r\nLater, he and Caroline were agreed that it was in very truth their\r\nlong-looked-for planet. There are no proprietary rights in newly\r\ndiscovered worlds--the reward is in the honor of the discovery, just as\r\nthe best recompense for a good deed lies in having done it.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society was the recording station, as Kiel, Greenwich and\r\nHarvard are now. Herschel made haste to get his new world on record\r\nthrough his kind neighbor, Doctor Watson.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society gave out the information, and soon various other\r\ntelescopes corroborated the discovery made by the Bath musician.\r\nHerschel christened his new discovery \"Georgium Sidus,\" in honor of the\r\nKing; but the star belonged as much to Germany and France as to England,\r\nand astronomers abroad scouted the idea of peppering the heavens with\r\nthe names of nobodies.\r\n\r\nSeveral astronomers suggested the name \"Herschel,\" if the discoverer\r\nwould consent, but this he would not do. Doctor Bode then named the new\r\nstar \"Uranus,\" and Uranus it is, although perhaps with any other name\r\n't would shine as bright.\r\n\r\nHerschel was forty-three years old when he discovered Uranus. He was\r\nstill a professional musician, and an amateur astronomer.\r\n\r\nBut it did not require much arguing on the part of Doctor Watson when he\r\npresented Herschel's name for membership in the Royal Society for that\r\nmost respectable body of scholars to at once pass favorably on the\r\nnomination. As one member in seconding the motion put it, \"Herschel\r\nhonors us in accepting this membership, quite as much as we do him in\r\ngranting it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the next paper presented by Herschel to the Royal Society appears\r\non the record signed \"William Herschel, F.R.S.\"\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards, it was to appear, \"William Herschel, F.R.S., LL.D.\r\n(Edinburgh)\"; and then \"Sir William Herschel, F.R.S., LL.D., D.C.L.\r\n(Oxon).\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge the Third, in about the year Seventeen Hundred Eighty-two, had\r\ninvited his distinguished Hanoverian countryman to become an attache of\r\nthe Court with the title of \"Astronomer to the King.\" The\r\nAstronomer-Royal, in charge of the Greenwich Observatory, was one Doctor\r\nMaskelyne, a man of much learning, a stickler for the fact, but with a\r\nmustard-seed imagination. Being asked his opinion of Herschel he assured\r\nthe company thus: \"Herschel is a great musician--a great musician!\"\r\nAfterwards Maskelyne explained that the reason Herschel saw more than\r\nother astronomers was because he had made himself a better telescope.\r\n\r\nOne real secret of Herschel's influence seems to have been his fine\r\nenthusiasm. He worked with such vim, such animation, that he radiated\r\nlight on every side. He set others to work, and his love for astronomy\r\nas a science created a demand for telescopes, which he himself had to\r\nsupply. It does not seem that he cared especially for money--all he made\r\nhe spent for new apparatus. He had a force of about a dozen men making\r\ntelescopes. He worked with them in blouse and overalls, and not one of\r\nhis workmen excelled him as a machinist. The King bought several of his\r\ntelescopes for from one hundred to three hundred pounds each, and\r\npresented them to universities and learned societies throughout the\r\nworld. One fine telescope was presented to the University of Gottingen,\r\nand Herschel was sent in person to present it. He was received with the\r\ngreatest honors, and scientists and musicians vied with one another to\r\ndo him homage.\r\n\r\nIn Seventeen Hundred Eighty-two Herschel and his sister gave up their\r\nmusical work and moved from Bath to quarters provided for them near\r\nWindsor Castle. Herschel's salary was then the modest sum of two hundred\r\npounds a year.\r\n\r\nCaroline was honored with the title \"Assistant to the King's Astronomer\"\r\nwith the stipend of fifty pounds a year. It will thus be seen that the\r\nkingly idea of astronomy had not traveled far from what it was when\r\nevery really respectable court had a retinue of singers, musicians,\r\nclowns, dancers, palmists and scientists to amuse the people somewhat\r\nironically called \"nobility.\" King George the Third paid his Cook,\r\nMaster of the Kennels, Chaplain and Astronomer the same amount. The\r\nfather of Richard Brinsley Sheridan was \"Elocutionist to the King,\" and\r\nwas paid a like sum.\r\n\r\nWhen Doctor Watson heard that Herschel was about to leave Bath he wrote,\r\n\"Never bought King honor so cheap.\"\r\n\r\nIt was nominated in the bond that Herschel should act as \"Guide to the\r\nheavens for the diversification of visitors whenever His Majesty wills\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was also provided that the astronomer should be allowed to carry\r\non the business of making and selling his telescopes.\r\n\r\nHerschel's enthusiasm for his beloved science never abated. But often\r\nhis imagination outran his facts.\r\n\r\nGreat minds divine the thing first--they see it with their inward eye.\r\nYet there may be danger in this, for in one's anxiety to prove what he\r\nfirst only imagined, small proof suffices. Thus Herschel was for many\r\nyears sure that the moon had an atmosphere and was inhabited; he thought\r\nthat he had seen clear through the Milky Way and discovered empty space\r\nbeyond; he calculated distances, and announced how far Castor was from\r\nPollux; he even made a guess as to how long it took for a gaseous nebula\r\nto resolve itself into a planetary system; he believed the sun was a\r\nmolten mass of fire--a thing that many believed until they saw the\r\nincandescent electric lamp--and in various other ways made daring\r\nprophecies which science has not only failed to corroborate, but which\r\nwe now know to be errors.\r\n\r\nBut the intensity of his nature was both his virtue and his weakness.\r\nMen who do nothing and say nothing are never ridiculous. Those who hope\r\nmuch, believe much, and love much, make mistakes.\r\n\r\nConstant effort and frequent mistakes are the stepping-stones of genius.\r\n\r\nIn all, Herschel contributed sixty-seven important papers to the\r\nproceedings of the Royal Society, and in one of these, which was written\r\nin his eightieth year, he says, \"My enthusiasm has occasionally led me\r\nastray, and I wish now to correct a statement which I made to you\r\ntwenty-eight years ago.\" He then enumerates some particular statement\r\nabout the height of mountains in the moon, and corrects it. Truth was\r\nmore to Herschel than consistency. Indeed, the earnestness, purity of\r\npurpose, and simplicity of his mind stamp him as one of the world's\r\ngreat men.\r\n\r\nAt Windsor he built a two-story observatory. In the wintertime every\r\nnight when the stars could be seen, was sacred. No matter how cold the\r\nweather, he stood and watched; while down below, the faithful Caroline\r\nsat and recorded the observations that he called down to her.\r\n\r\nCaroline was his confidante, adviser, secretary, servant, friend. She\r\nhad a telescope of her own, and when her brother did not need her\r\nservices she swept the heavens on her own account for maverick comets.\r\nIn her work she was eminently successful, and five comets at least are\r\nplaced to her credit on the honor-roll by right of priority. Her\r\ndiscoveries were duly forwarded by her brother to the Royal Society for\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nLater, the King of Prussia was to honor her with a gold medal, and\r\nseveral learned societies elected her an honorary member. When Herschel\r\nreached the discreet age of fifty he married the worthy Mrs. John Pitt,\r\nformer wife of a London merchant. It is believed that the marriage was\r\narranged by the King in person, out of his great love for both parties.\r\nAt any rate Miss Burney thought so. Miss Burney was Keeper of the Royal\r\nWardrobe at the same salary that Herschel had been receiving--two\r\nhundred pounds a year. She also took charge of the Court Gossip, with\r\nvarious volunteer assistants. \"Gold, as well as stars, glitters for\r\nastronomers,\" said little Miss Burney. \"Mrs. Pitt is very rich, meek,\r\nquiet, rather pretty and quite unobjectionable.\" But poor Caroline!\r\n\r\nIt nearly broke her heart. William was her idol--she lived but for\r\nhim--now she seemed to be replaced. She moved away into a modest cottage\r\nof her own, resolved that she would not be an encumbrance to any one.\r\nShe thought she was going into a decline, and would not live long\r\nanyway--she was so pale and slight that Miss Burney said it took two of\r\nher to make a shadow.\r\n\r\nBut we get a glimpse of Caroline's energy when we find her writing home\r\nexplaining how she had just painted her house, inside and out, with her\r\nown hands.\r\n\r\nThings are never so bad as they seem. It was not very long before\r\nWilliam was sending for Caroline to come and help him out with his\r\nmathematical calculations. Later, when a fine boy baby arrived in the\r\nHerschel solar system, Caroline forgave all and came to take care of\r\nwhat she called \"the Herschel planetoid.\" She loved this baby as her\r\nown, and all the pent-up motherhood in her nature went out to the little\r\n\"Sir John Herschel,\" the knighthood having been conferred on him by\r\nCaroline before he was a month old.\r\n\r\nMrs. Herschel was beautiful and amiable, and she and Caroline became\r\ngenuine sisters in spirit. Each had her own work to do; they were not in\r\ncompetition save in their love for the baby. As the boy grew, Caroline\r\ntook upon herself the task of teaching him astronomy, quite to the\r\namusement of the father and mother. Fanny Burney now comes with a little\r\nflung-off nebula to the effect that \"Herschel is quite the happiest man\r\nin the kingdom.\" There is a most charming little biography of Caroline\r\nHerschel, written by the good wife of Sir John Herschel, wherein some\r\nvery gentle foibles are laid bare, and where at the same time tribute is\r\npaid to a great and beautiful spirit. The idea that Caroline was not\r\ngoing to live long after the marriage of her brother was \"greatly\r\nexaggerated\"--she lived to be ninety-eight, a century lacking two years!\r\nHer mind was bright to the last--when ninety she sang at a concert given\r\nfor the benefit of an old ladies' home. At ninety-six she danced a\r\nminuet with the King of Prussia, and requested that worthy not to\r\nintroduce her as \"the woman astronomer, because, you know, I was only\r\nthe assistant of my brother!\" William Herschel died in his eighty-fourth\r\nyear, with his fame at full, honored, respected, beloved.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel, his son, was worthy to be called the son of his\r\nfather. He was an active worker in the field of science--a strong, yet\r\ngentle man, with no jealousy nor whim in his nature. \"His life was full\r\nof the docility of a sage and the innocence of a child.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Herschel died at Collingwood, May Eleventh, Eighteen Hundred\r\nSeventy-one, and his dust is now resting in Westminster Abbey, close by\r\nthe grave of England's famous scholar, Sir Isaac Newton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES DARWIN]\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN\r\n\r\n\r\n     I feel most deeply that this whole question of Creation is too\r\n     profound for human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the\r\n     mind of Newton! Let each man hope and believe what he can.\r\n\r\n     --_Charles Darwin to Asa Gray_\r\n\r\n     None have fought better, and none have been more fortunate, than\r\n     Charles Darwin. He found a great truth trodden underfoot, reviled\r\n     by bigots, and ridiculed by all the world; he lived long enough to\r\n     see it, chiefly by his own efforts, irrefragably established in\r\n     science, inseparably incorporated into the common thoughts of men.\r\n     What shall a man desire more than this?\r\n\r\n     --_Thomas Huxley, Address, April Twenty-seventh, Eighteen Hundred\r\n     Eighty-two_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN\r\n\r\nEvolution is at work everywhere, even in the matter of jokes. Once\r\nin the House of Commons, Benjamin Disraeli, who prided himself on his\r\nfine scholarship as well as on his Hyperion curl, interrupted a speaker\r\nand corrected him on a matter of history.\r\n\r\n\"I would rather be a gentleman than a scholar!\" the man replied. \"My\r\nfriend is seldom either,\" came the quick response.\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas Brackett Reed was Speaker of the House of Representatives, a\r\nmember once took exception to a ruling of the \"Czar,\" and having in mind\r\nReed's supposed Presidential aspirations closed his protests with the\r\nthrust, \"I would rather be right than President.\" \"The gentleman will\r\nnever be either,\" came the instant retort.\r\n\r\nBut some years before the reign of the American Czar, Gladstone, Premier\r\nof England, said, \"I would rather be right and believe in the Bible,\r\nthan excite a body of curious, infidelic, so-called scientists to\r\nunbecoming wonder by tracing their ancestry to a troglodyte.\" And Huxley\r\nreplied, \"I, too, would rather be right--I would rather be right than\r\nPremier.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin was a Gentle Man. He was the greatest naturalist of his\r\ntime, and a more perfect gentleman never lived. His son Francis said: \"I\r\ncan not remember ever hearing my father utter an unkind or hasty word.\r\nIf in his presence some one was being harshly criticized, he always\r\nthought of something to say in way of palliation and excuse.\"\r\n\r\nOne of his companions on the \"Beagle,\" who saw him daily for five years\r\non that memorable trip, wrote: \"A protracted sea-voyage is a most severe\r\ntest of friendship, and Darwin was the only man on our ship, or that I\r\never heard of, who stood the ordeal. He never lost his temper or made an\r\nunkind remark.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitz-Roy of the \"Beagle\" was a disciplinarian, and absolute in\r\nhis authority, as a sea-captain must be. The ship had just left one of\r\nthe South American ports where the captain had gone ashore and been\r\nentertained by a coffee-planter. On this plantation all the work was\r\ndone by slaves, who, no doubt, were very well treated.\r\n\r\nThe captain thought that negroes well cared for were very much better\r\noff than if free. And further, he related how the owner had called up\r\nvarious slaves and had the Captain ask them if they wished their\r\nfreedom, and the answer was always, \"No.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin interposed by asking the Captain what he thought the answer of a\r\nslave was worth when being interrogated in the presence of his owner.\r\n\r\nHere Fitz-Roy flew into a passion, berating the volunteer naturalist,\r\nand suggested a taste of the rope's end in lieu of logic. Young Darwin\r\nmade no reply, and seemingly did not hear the uncalled-for chidings.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours a sailor handed him a note from Captain Fitz-Roy, full of\r\nabject apology for having so forgotten himself. Darwin was then but\r\ntwenty-two years old, but the poise and patience of the young man won\r\nthe respect and then the admiration and finally the affection of every\r\nman on board that ship. This attitude of kindness, patience and\r\ngood-will formed the strongest attribute of Darwin's nature, and to\r\nthese godlike qualities he was heir from a royal line of ancestry. No\r\nman was ever more blest--more richly endowed by his parents with love\r\nand intellect--than Darwin. And no man ever repaid the debt of love more\r\nfully--all that he had received he gave again.\r\n\r\nDarwin is the Saint of Science. He proves the possible; and when mankind\r\nshall have evolved to a point where such men will be the rule, not the\r\nexception--as one in a million--then, and not until then, can we say we\r\nare a civilized people.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin was not only the greatest thinker of his time (with\r\npossibly one exception), but in his simplicity and earnestness, in his\r\nlimpid love for truth--his perfect willingness to abandon his opinion if\r\nhe were found to be wrong--in all these things he proved himself the\r\ngreatest man of his time.\r\n\r\nYet it is absurd to try to separate the scientist from the father,\r\nneighbor and friend. Darwin's love for truth as a scientist was what\r\nlifted him out of the fog of whim and prejudice and set him apart as a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nHe had no time to hate. He had no time to indulge in foolish debates and\r\nstruggle for rhetorical mastery--he had his work to do.\r\n\r\nThat statesmen like Gladstone misquoted him, and churchmen like\r\nWilberforce reviled him--these things were as naught to Darwin--his face\r\nwas toward the sunrising. To be able to know the truth, and to state it,\r\nwere vital issues: whether the truth was accepted by this man or that\r\nwas quite immaterial, except possibly to the man himself. There was no\r\nresentment in Darwin's nature.\r\n\r\nOnly love is immortal--hate is a negative condition. It is love that\r\nanimates, beautifies, benefits, refines, creates. So firmly was this\r\ntruth fixed in the heart of Darwin that throughout his long life the\r\nonly things he feared and shunned were hate and prejudice. \"They hinder\r\nand blind a man to truth,\" he said--\"a scientist must only love.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEmerson has been called the culminating flower of seven generations of\r\nNew England culture. Charles Darwin seems a similar culminating product.\r\n\r\nSurely he showed rare judgment in the selection of his grandparents. His\r\ngrandfather on his father's side was Doctor Erasmus Darwin, a poet, a\r\nnaturalist, and a physician so discerning that he once wrote: \"The\r\nscience of medicine will some time resolve itself into a science of\r\nprevention rather than a matter of cure. Man was made to be well, and\r\nthe best medicine I know of is an active and intelligent interest in the\r\nworld of Nature.\"\r\n\r\nErasmus Darwin had the felicity to have his biography written in German,\r\nand he also has his place in the \"Encyclopedia Britannica\" quite\r\nindependent of that of his gifted grandson.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin's grandfather on his mother's side was Josiah Wedgwood,\r\none of the most versatile of men. He was as fine in spirit as those\r\nexquisite designs by Flaxman that you will see today on the Wedgwood\r\npottery. Josiah Wedgwood was a businessman--an organizer, and he was\r\nbeyond this, an artist, a naturalist, a sociologist and a lover of his\r\nrace. His portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds reveals a man of rare\r\nintelligence, and his biography is as interesting as a novel by Kipling.\r\nHis space in the \"Encyclopedia Britannica\" is even more important than\r\nthat occupied by his dear friend and neighbor, Doctor Erasmus Darwin.\r\nThe hand of the Potter did not shake when Josiah Wedgwood was made.\r\nJosiah Wedgwood and Doctor Darwin had mutually promised their children\r\nin marriage. Wedgwood became rich and he made numerous other men rich,\r\nand he enriched the heart and the intellect of England by setting before\r\nit beautiful things, and by living an earnest, active and beautiful\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nJosiah Wedgwood coined the word \"queensware.\" He married his cousin,\r\nSarah Wedgwood. Their daughter, Susannah Wedgwood, married Doctor Robert\r\nDarwin, and Charles Darwin, their son, married Emma Wedgwood, a daughter\r\nof Josiah Wedgwood the Second. Caroline Darwin, a sister of Charles\r\nDarwin, married Josiah Wedgwood the Third. Let those who have the time\r\nwork out this origin of species in detail and show us the relationship\r\nof the Darwins and Wedgwoods. And I hope we'll hear no more about the\r\nfolly of cousins marrying, when Charles Darwin is before us as an\r\nexample of natural selection.\r\n\r\nFrom his mother Darwin inherited those traits of gentleness, insight,\r\npurity of purpose, patience and persistency that set him apart as a\r\nmarked man.\r\n\r\nThe father of Charles Darwin, Doctor Robert Darwin, was a most\r\nsuccessful physician of Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\nHis marriage to Susannah Wedgwood filled his heart, and also placed him\r\non a firm financial footing, and he seemed to take his choice of\r\npatients. Doctor Darwin was a man devoted to his family, respected by\r\nhis neighbors, and he lived long enough to see his son recognized,\r\ngreatly to his surprise, as one of England's foremost scientists.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin in youth was rather slow in intellect, and in form and\r\nfeature far from handsome. Physically he was never strong. In\r\ndisposition he was gentle and most lovable. His mother died when he was\r\neight years of age, and his three older sisters then mothered him.\r\nBetween them all existed a tie of affection, very gentle, and very firm.\r\n\r\nThe girls knew that Charles would become an eminent man--just how they\r\ncould not guess--but he would be a leader of men: they felt it in their\r\nhearts. It was all the beautiful dream that the mother has for her babe\r\nas she sings to the man-child a lullaby as the sun goes down.\r\n\r\nIn his autobiographical sketch, written when he was past sixty, Darwin\r\nmentions this faith and love of his sisters, and says, \"Personally, I\r\nnever had much ambition, but when at college I felt that I must work, if\r\nfor no other reason, so as not to disappoint my sisters.\"\r\n\r\nAt school Charles was considerable of a grubber: he worked hard because\r\nhe felt that it was his duty. English boarding-schools have always\r\ntaught things out of season, and very often have succeeded in making\r\nlearning wholly repugnant. Perhaps that is the reason why nine men out\r\nof ten who go to college cease all study as soon as they stand on \"the\r\nthreshold,\" looking at life ere they seize it by the tail and snap its\r\nhead off. To them education is one thing and life another.\r\n\r\nBut with many headaches and many heartaches Charles got through\r\nCambridge and then was sent to attend lectures at the University of\r\nEdinburgh. Of one lecturer in Scotland he says, \"The good man was really\r\nmore dull than his books, and how I escaped without all science being\r\nutterly distasteful to me I hardly know.\" To Cambridge, Darwin owed\r\nnothing but the association with other minds, yet this was much, and\r\nalmost justifies the college. \"Send your sons to college and the boys\r\nwill educate them,\" said Emerson.\r\n\r\nThe most beneficent influence for Darwin at Cambridge was the friendship\r\nbetween himself and Professor Henslow. Darwin became known as \"the man\r\nwho walks with Henslow.\" The professor taught botany, and took his\r\nclasses on tramps a-field and on barge rides down the river, giving\r\nout-of-door lectures on the way. This commonsense way of teaching\r\nappealed to Darwin greatly, and although he did not at Cambridge take up\r\nbotany as a study, yet when Henslow had an out-of-door class he usually\r\nmanaged to go along.\r\n\r\nIn his autobiography Darwin gives great credit to this very gentle and\r\nsimple soul, who, although not being great as a thinker, yet could\r\nanimate and arouse a pleasurable interest.\r\n\r\nHenslow was once admonished by the faculty for his lack of discipline,\r\nand young Darwin came near getting himself into difficulty by declaring,\r\n\"Professor Henslow teaches his pupils in love; the others think they\r\nknow a better way!\"\r\n\r\nThe hope of his father and sisters was that Charles Darwin would become\r\na clergyman. For the army he had no taste whatsoever, and at twenty-one\r\nthe only thing seemed to be the Church. Not that the young man was\r\nfilled with religious zeal--far from that--but one must, you know, do\r\nsomething. Up to this time he had studied in a desultory way; he had\r\nalso dreamed and tramped the fields. He had done considerable\r\ngrouse-shooting and had developed a little too much skill in that\r\nparticular line.\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase Herbert Spencer, to shoot fairly well is a manly\r\naccomplishment, but to shoot too well is evidence of an ill-spent youth.\r\nDoctor Darwin was having fears that his son was going to be an idle\r\nsportsman, and he was urging the divinity-school.\r\n\r\nThe real fact was that sportsmanship was already becoming distasteful to\r\nyoung Darwin, and his hunting expeditions were now largely carried on\r\nwith a botanist's drum and a geologist's hammer.\r\n\r\nBut to the practical Doctor these things were no better than the gun--it\r\nwas idling, anyway. Natural History as a pastime was excellent, and\r\nsportsmanship for exercise and recreation had its place, but the\r\nbusiness of life must not be neglected--Charles should get himself to a\r\ndivinity-school, and quickly, too.\r\n\r\nThings urged become repellent; and Charles was groping around for an\r\nexcuse when a letter came from Professor Henslow, saying, among other\r\nthings, that the Government was about to send a ship around the world on\r\na scientific surveying tour, especially to map the coast of Patagonia\r\nand other parts of South America and Australia. A volunteer naturalist\r\nwas wanted--board and passage free, but the volunteer was to supply his\r\nown clothes and instruments.\r\n\r\nThe proposition gave Charles a great thrill: he gave a gulp and a gasp\r\nand went in search of his father. The father saw nothing in the plan\r\nbeyond the fact that the Government was going to get several years' work\r\nout of some foolish young man, for nothing--gadzooks!\r\n\r\nCharles insisted--he wanted to go! He urged that on this trip he would\r\nbe to but very little expense. \"You say I have cost you much, but the\r\nfellow who can spend money on board ship must be very clever.\" \"But you\r\nare a very clever young man, they say,\" the father replied. That night\r\nCharles again insisted on discussing the matter. The father was\r\nexasperated and exclaimed, \"Go and find me one sane man who will endorse\r\nyour wild-goose chase and I will give my consent.\"\r\n\r\nCharles said no more--he would find that \"sane man.\" But he knew\r\nperfectly well that if any average person endorsed the plan his father\r\nwould declare the man was insane, and the proof of it lay in the fact\r\nthat he endorsed the wild-goose chase.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Charles started of his own accord to see Henslow. Henslow\r\nwould endorse the trip, but both parties knew that Doctor Darwin would\r\nnot accept a mere college professor as sane. Charles went home and\r\ntramped thirty miles across the country to the home of his uncle, Josiah\r\nWedgwood the Second. There he knew he had an advocate for anything he\r\nmight wish, in the person of his fair cousin, Emma. These two laid their\r\nheads together, made a plan and stalked their prey.\r\n\r\nThey cornered Josiah the Second after dinner and showed him how it was\r\nthe chance of a lifetime--this trip on H.M.S. the \"Beagle\"! Charles\r\nwasn't adapted for a clergyman, anyway; he wanted to be a ship-captain,\r\na traveler, a discoverer, a scientist, an author like Sir John\r\nMandeville, or something else. Josiah the Second had but to speak the\r\nword and Doctor Darwin would be silenced, and the recommendation of so\r\ngreat a man as Josiah Wedgwood would secure the place.\r\n\r\nJosiah the Second laughed--then he looked sober. He agreed with the\r\nproposition--it was the chance of a lifetime. He would go back home with\r\nCharles and put the Doctor straight. And he did.\r\n\r\nAnd on the personal endorsement of Josiah Wedgwood and Professor\r\nHenslow, Charles Robert Darwin was duly booked as Volunteer Naturalist\r\nin Her Majesty's service.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitz-Roy of the \"Beagle\" liked Charles Darwin until he began to\r\nlook him over with a very professional eye. Then he declared his nose\r\nwas too large and was not rightly shaped; besides, he was too tall for\r\nhis weight: outside of these points the Volunteer would answer. On\r\ntalking with young Darwin further, the Captain liked him better, and he\r\nwaived all imperfections, although no promise was made that they would\r\nbe remedied. In fact, Captain Fitz-Roy liked Charles so well that he\r\ninvited him to share his own cabin and mess with him. The sailors, on\r\nseeing this, touched respectful forefingers to their caps and began\r\naddressing the Volunteer as \"Sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Beagle\" sailed on December Twenty-seven, Eighteen Hundred\r\nThirty-one, and it was fully four years and ten months before Charles\r\nDarwin saw England again. The trip decided the business of Darwin for\r\nthe rest of his life, and thereby an epoch was worked in the upward and\r\nonward march of the race.\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitz-Roy of the British Navy was but twenty-three years old. He\r\nwas a draftsman, a geographer, a mathematician and a navigator. He had\r\nsailed around the world as a plain tar, and taken his kicks and cuffs\r\nwith good grace. At the Portsmouth Naval School he had won a gold medal\r\nfor proficiency in study, and another medal had been given him for\r\nheroism in leaping from a sailing-ship into the sea to save a drowning\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\nLet us be fair--the tight little island has produced men. To evolve\r\nthese few good men she may have produced many millions of the spawn of\r\nearth, but let the fact stand--England has produced men. Here was a\r\nbeardless youth, slight in form, silent by habit, but so well thought of\r\nby his Government that he was given charge of a ship, five officers, two\r\nsurgeons and forty-one picked men to go around the world and make\r\nmeasurements of certain coral-reefs, and map the dangerous coasts of\r\nPatagonia and Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\nThe ship was provisioned for two years, but the orders were, \"Do the\r\nwork, no matter how long it may take, and your drafts on the Government\r\nwill be honored.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitz-Roy was a man of decision: he knew just where he wanted to\r\ngo, and what there was to do. He was to measure and map dreary wastes of\r\ntossing tide, and to do the task so accurately that it would never have\r\nto be done again: his maps were to remain forever a solace, a safety and\r\na security to the men who go down to the sea in ships.\r\n\r\nEngland has certainly produced men--and Fitz-Roy was one of them.\r\nFitz-Roy is now known to us, not for his maps which have passed into the\r\nmutual wealth of the world, but because he took on this trip, merely as\r\nan afterthought, a volunteer naturalist.\r\n\r\nBefore the \"Beagle\" sailed, Captain Fitz-Roy and young Mr. Darwin went\r\ndown to Portsmouth, and the Captain showed him the ship. The Captain\r\ntook pains to explain the worst. It was to be at least two years of\r\nclose, unremitting toil. It was no pleasure-excursion--there were no\r\namusements provided, no cards, no wine on the table; the fare was to be\r\nsimple in the extreme. This way of putting the matter was most\r\nattractive to Darwin--Fitz-Roy became a hero in his eyes at once. The\r\nCaptain's manner inspired much confidence--he was a man who did not have\r\nto be amused or cajoled. \"You will be left alone to do your work,\" said\r\nFitz-Roy to Darwin, \"and I must have the cabin to myself when I ask for\r\nit.\" And that settled it. Life aboard ship is like life in jail. It\r\nmeans freedom, freedom from interruption--you have your evenings to\r\nyourself, and the days as well. Darwin admired every man on board the\r\nship, and most of all, the man who selected them, and so wrote home to\r\nhis sisters. He admired the men because each was intent on doing his\r\nwork, and each one seemed to assume that his own particular work was\r\nreally the most important.\r\n\r\nSecond Officer Wickham was entrusted to see that the ship was in good\r\norder, and so thorough was he that he once said to Darwin, who was\r\nconstantly casting his net for specimens, \"If I were the skipper, I'd\r\nsoon have you and your beastly belittlement out of this ship with all\r\nyour devilish, damned mess.\" And Darwin, much amused, wrote this down in\r\nhis journal, and added, \"Wickham is a most capital fellow.\" The\r\ndiscipline and system of ship-life, the necessity of working in a small\r\nspace, and of improving the calm weather, and seizing every moment when\r\non shore, all tended to work in Darwin's nature exactly the habit that\r\nwas needed to make him the greatest naturalist of his age.\r\n\r\nEvery sort of life that lived in the sea was new and wonderful to him.\r\nVery early on this trip Darwin began to work on the \"Cirripedia\"\r\n(barnacles), and we hear of Captain Fitz-Roy obligingly hailing\r\nhomeward-bound ships, and putting out a small boat, rowing alongside,\r\nasking politely, to the astonishment of the party hailed, \"Would you\r\noblige us with a few barnacles off the bottom of your ship?\" All this\r\nthat the Volunteer, who was dubbed the \"Flycatcher,\" might have\r\nsomething upon which to work.\r\n\r\nWhen on shore a sailor was detailed by Captain Fitz-Roy just to attend\r\nthe \"Flycatcher,\" with a bag to carry the specimens, geological,\r\nbotanical and zoological, and a cabin-boy was set apart to write notes.\r\nThis boy, who afterward became Governor of Queens and a K.C.B., used\r\nin after years to boast a bit, and rightfully, of his share in producing\r\n\"The Origin of Species.\" When urged to smoke, Darwin replied, \"I am not\r\nmaking any new necessities for myself.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the weather was rough the \"Flycatcher\" was sick, much to the\r\ndelight of Wickham; but if the ship was becalmed, Darwin came out and\r\ngloried in the sunshine, and in his work of dissecting, labeling, and\r\nwriting memoranda and data. The sailors might curse the weather--he did\r\nnot. Thus passed the days. At each stop many specimens were secured, and\r\nthese were to be sorted and sifted out at leisure.\r\n\r\nOn shore the Captain had his work to do, and it was only after a year\r\nthat Darwin accidentally discovered that the sailor who was sent to\r\ncarry his specimens was always armed with knife and revolver, and his\r\norders were not so much to carry what Wickham called, \"the damned\r\nplunder,\" as to see that no harm befell the \"Flycatcher.\"\r\n\r\nFitz-Roy's interest in the scientific work was only general: longitude\r\nand latitude, his twenty-four chronometers, his maps and constant\r\nsoundings, with minute records, kept his time occupied.\r\n\r\nFor Darwin and his specimens, however, he had a constantly growing\r\nrespect, and when the long five-year trip was ended, Darwin realized\r\nthat the gruff and grim Captain was indeed his friend. Captain Fitz-Roy\r\nhad trouble with everybody on board in turn, thus proving his\r\nimpartiality; but when parting was nigh, tears came to his eyes as he\r\nembraced Darwin, and said, with prophetic yet broken words, \"The\r\n'Beagle's' voyage may be remembered more through you than me--I hope it\r\nwill be so!\" And Darwin, too moved for speech, said nothing except\r\nthrough the pressure of his hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe idea of evolution took a firm hold upon the mind of Darwin, in an\r\ninstant, one day while on board the \"Beagle.\" From that very hour the\r\nthought of the mutability of species was the one controlling impulse of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nOn his return from the trip around the world he found himself in\r\npossession of an immense mass of specimens and much data bearing\r\ndirectly upon the point that creation is still going on.\r\n\r\nThat he could ever sort, sift and formulate his evidence on his own\r\naccount, he never at this time imagined. Indeed, about all he thought he\r\ncould do was to present his notes and specimens to some scientific\r\nsociety, in the hope that some of its members would go ahead and use the\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nWith this thought in mind he began to open correspondence with several\r\nof the universities and with various professors of science, and to his\r\ndismay found that no one was willing even to read his notes, much less\r\nhouse, prepare for preservation, and index his thousands of specimens.\r\n\r\nHe read papers before different scientific societies, however, from time\r\nto time, and gradually in London it dawned upon the few thinkers that\r\nthis modest and low-voiced young man was doing a little thinking on his\r\nown account. One man to whom he had offered the specimens bluntly\r\nexplained to Darwin that his specimens and ideas were valuable to no one\r\nbut himself, and it was folly to try to give such things away. Ideas\r\nare like children and should be cared for by their parents, and\r\nspecimens are for the collector.\r\n\r\nSeeing the depression of the young man, this friend offered to present\r\nthe matter to the Secretary of the Exchequer. Everything can be done\r\nwhen the right man takes hold of it: the sum of one thousand pounds was\r\nappropriated by the Treasury for Charles Darwin's use in bringing out a\r\nGovernment report of the voyage of the \"Beagle.\" And Darwin set to work,\r\nrefreshed, rejoiced and encouraged. He was living in London in modest\r\nquarters, solitary and alone. He was not handsome, and he lacked the\r\ndash and flash that make a success in society. On a trip to his old\r\nhome, he walked across the country to see his uncle, Josiah Wedgwood the\r\nSecond.\r\n\r\nWhen he left it was arranged that he should return in a month and marry\r\nhis cousin, Emma Wedgwood. And it was all so done.\r\n\r\nOne commentator said he married his cousin because he didn't know any\r\nother woman that would have him. But none was so unkind as to say that\r\nhe married her in order to get rid of her, yet Henslow wondered how he\r\nceased wooing science long enough to woo the lady.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the parents of both parties had a little to do with the\r\narrangement, and in this instance it was beautiful and well. Darwin was\r\nmarried to his work, and no such fallacy as marrying a woman in order\r\nto educate her filled his mind.\r\n\r\nHis wife was his mental mate, his devoted helper and friend.\r\n\r\nIt is no small matter for a wife to be her husband's friend.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darwin had no small aspirations of her own. She flew the futile\r\nFour-o'Clock and made no flannel nightgowns for Fijis. Twenty years\r\nafter his marriage, Darwin wrote thus: \"It is probably as you say--I\r\nhave done an enormous amount of work. And this was only possible through\r\nthe devotion of my wife, who, ignoring every idea of pleasure and\r\ncomfort for herself, arranged in a thousand ways to give me joy and\r\nrest, peace and most valuable inspiration and assistance. If I\r\noccasionally lost faith in myself, she most certainly never did. Only\r\ntwo hours a day could I work, and these to her were sacred. She guarded\r\nme as a mother guards her babe, and I look back now and see how\r\nhopelessly undone I should have been without her.\"\r\n\r\nIn Eighteen Hundred Forty-two, Darwin and his wife moved to the village\r\nof Down, County of Kent. The place where they lived was a rambling old\r\nstone house with ample garden. The country was rough and unbroken, and\r\none might have imagined he was a thousand miles from London, instead of\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\nThere were no aristocratic neighbors, no society to speak of. With the\r\nplain farmers and simple folk of the village Darwin was on good terms.\r\nHe became treasurer of the local improvement society, and thereby was\r\nserenaded once a year by a brass band. We hear of the good old village\r\nrector once saying, \"Mr. Darwin knows botany better than anybody this\r\nside of Kew; and although I am sorry to say that he seldom goes to\r\nchurch, yet he is a good neighbor and almost a model citizen.\" Together\r\nthe clergyman and his neighbor discussed the merits of climbing roses,\r\nmorning-glories and sweet-peas. Darwin met all and every one on terms of\r\nabsolute equality, and never forced his scientific hypotheses upon any\r\none. In fact, no one in the village imagined this quiet country\r\ngentleman in the dusty gray clothes that matched his full iron-gray\r\nbeard was destined for a place in Westminster Abbey--no, not even\r\nhimself!\r\n\r\nDarwin's father, seeing that the Government had recognized him, and that\r\nall the scientific societies of London were quite willing to do as much,\r\nsettled on him an allowance that was ample for his simple wants.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Doctor Darwin, Charles became possessed of an\r\ninheritance that brought him a yearly income of a little over five\r\nhundred pounds. Children came to bless this happy household--seven in\r\nall. With these Darwin was both comrade and teacher. Two hours a day\r\nwere sacred to science, but outside of this time the children made the\r\nstudy their own, and littered the place with their collections gathered\r\non heath and dale.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the \"holy time\" was strong in the minds of the\r\nchildren, so no prohibitions were needed. One daughter has written in\r\nfamiliar way of once wanting to go into her father's study for a\r\nforgotten pair of scissors. It was the \"holy time,\" and she thought she\r\ncould not wait, so she took off her shoes and entered in stocking feet,\r\nhoping to be unobserved. Her father was working at his microscope: he\r\nsaw her, reached out one arm as she passed, drew her to him and kissed\r\nher forehead. The little girl never again trespassed--how could she,\r\nwith the father that gave her only love! That there was no sternness in\r\nthis recognition of the value of the working hours is further indicated\r\nin that little Francis, aged six, once put his head in the door and\r\noffered the father a sixpence if he would come out and play in the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nFor several years Darwin was village magistrate. Most of the cases\r\nbrought before him were either for poaching or drunkenness. \"He always\r\nseemed to be trying to find an excuse for the prisoner, and usually\r\nsucceeded,\" says his son.\r\n\r\nOne time, when a prosecuting attorney complained because he had\r\ndischarged a prisoner, Darwin, who might have fined the impudent\r\nattorney for contempt of court, merely said: \"Why, he's as good as we\r\nare. If tempted in the same way I am sure that I would have done as he\r\nhas done. We can't blame a man for doing what he has to do!\" This was\r\npoor reasoning from a legal point of view. Darwin afterward admitted\r\nthat he didn't hear much of the evidence, as his mind was full of\r\norchids, but the fellow looked sorry, and he really couldn't punish\r\nanybody who had simply made a mistake. The local legal lights gradually\r\nlost faith in Magistrate Darwin's peculiar brand of justice; he hadn't\r\nmuch respect for law, and once when a lawyer cited him the criminal code\r\nhe said, \"Tut, tut, that was made a hundred years ago!\" Then he fined\r\nthe man five shillings, and paid the fine himself, when he should have\r\nsent him to the workhouse for six months.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe men who have most benefited the world have, almost without\r\nexception, been looked down upon by the priestly class. That is to say,\r\nthe men upon whose tombs society now carves the word Savior were\r\noutcasts and criminals in their day.\r\n\r\nIn a society where the priest is regarded as the mouthpiece of divinity,\r\nand therefore the highest type of man, the artist, the inventor, the\r\ndiscoverer, the genius, the man of truth, has always been regarded as a\r\ncriminal. Society advances as it doubts the priest, distrusts his\r\noracles, and loses faith in his institution.\r\n\r\nIn the priest, at first, was deposited all human knowledge, and what he\r\ndid not know he pretended to know. He was the guardian of mind and\r\nmorals, and the cure of souls. To question him was to die here and be\r\ndamned for eternity.\r\n\r\nThe problem of civilization has been to get the truth past the preacher\r\nto the people: he has forever barred and blocked the way, and until he\r\nwas shorn of his temporal power there was no hope. The prisons were\r\nfirst made for those who doubted the priest; behind and beneath every\r\nepiscopal residence were dungeons; the ferocious and delicate tortures\r\nthat reached every physical and mental nerve were his. His anathemas and\r\ncurses were always quickly turned upon the strong men of mountain or sea\r\nwho dared live natural lives, said what they thought was truth, or did\r\nwhat they deemed was right. Science is a search for truth, but theology\r\nis a clutch for power.\r\n\r\nNothing is so distasteful to a priest as freedom: a happy, exuberant,\r\nfearless, self-sufficient and radiant man he both feared and abhorred. A\r\nfree soul was regarded by the Church as one to be dealt with. The priest\r\nhas ever put a premium on pretense and hypocrisy. Nothing recommended a\r\nman more than humility and the acknowledgment that he was a worm of the\r\ndust. The ability to do and dare was in itself considered a proof of\r\ndepravity.\r\n\r\nThe education of the young has been monopolized by priests in order to\r\nperpetuate the fallacies of theology, and all endeavor to put education\r\non a footing of usefulness and utility has been fought inch by inch.\r\n\r\nAndrew D. White, in his book, \"The Warfare of Science and Religion,\" has\r\ncalmly and without heat sketched the war that Science has had to make to\r\nreach the light. Slowly, stubbornly, insolently, theology has fought\r\nTruth step by step--but always retreating, taking refuge first behind\r\none subterfuge, then another. When an alleged fact was found to be a\r\nfallacy, we were told it was not a literal fact, simply a spiritual one.\r\nAll of theology's weapons have been taken from her and placed in the\r\nMuseum of Horrors--all save one, namely, social ostracism. And this\r\nconsists in a refusal to invite Science to indulge in cream-puffs.\r\n\r\nWe smile, knowing that the man who now successfully defies theology is\r\nthe only one she really, yet secretly, admires. If he does not run after\r\nher, she holds true the poetic unities by running after him. Mankind is\r\nemancipated (or partially so).\r\n\r\nDarwin's fame rests, for the most part, on two books, \"The Origin of\r\nSpecies\" and \"The Descent of Man.\"\r\n\r\nYet before these were published he had issued \"A Journal of Research\r\ninto Geology and Natural History,\" \"The Zoology of the Voyage of the\r\n'Beagle,'\" \"A Treatise on Coral Reefs, Volcanic Islands, Geological\r\nObservations,\" and \"A Monograph of the Cirripedia.\" Had Darwin died\r\nbefore \"The Origin of Species\" was published, he would have been famous\r\namong scientific men, although it was the abuse of theologians on the\r\npublication of \"The Origin of Species\" that really made him\r\nworld-famous.\r\n\r\nAlfred Russel Wallace, Darwin's chief competitor said that \"A Monograph\r\non the Cirripedia\" is enough upon which to found a deathless reputation.\r\nDarwin was equally eminent in Geology, Botany and Zoology.\r\n\r\nOn November Twenty-fourth, Eighteen Hundred Fifty-nine, was published\r\n\"The Origin of Species.\" Murray had hesitated about accepting the work,\r\nbut on the earnest solicitation of Sir Charles Lyell, who gave his\r\npersonal guarantee to the publisher against loss, quite unknown to\r\nDarwin, twelve hundred copies of the book were printed. The edition was\r\nsold in one day, and who was surprised most, the author or the\r\npublisher, it is difficult to say.\r\n\r\nUp to this time theology had stood solidly on the biblical assertion\r\nthat mankind had sprung from one man and one woman, and that in the\r\nbeginning every species was fixed and immutable. Aristotle, three\r\nhundred years before Christ, had suggested that, by cross-fertilization\r\nand change of environment, new species had been and were being evoked.\r\nBut the Church had declared Aristotle a heathen, and in every school and\r\ncollege of Christendom it was taught that the world and everything in it\r\nwas created in six days of twenty-four hours each, and that this\r\noccurred four thousand and four years before Christ, on May Tenth.\r\n\r\nThose who doubted or disputed this statement had no standing in society,\r\nand in truth, until the beginning of the Nineteenth Century, were in\r\nactual danger of death--heresy and treason being usually regarded as the\r\nsame thing.\r\n\r\nErasmus Darwin had taught that species were not immutable, but his words\r\nwere so veiled in the language of poesy that they naturally went\r\nunchallenged. But now the grandson of Doctor Erasmus Darwin came forward\r\nwith the net result of thirty years' continuous work. \"The Origin of\r\nSpecies\" did not attack any one's religious belief--in fact, in it the\r\nbiblical account of Creation is not once referred to. It was a calm,\r\njudicial record of close study and observation, that seemed to prove\r\nthat life began in very lowly forms, and that it has constantly\r\nascended and differentiated, new forms and new species being continually\r\ncreated, and that the work of creation still goes on.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to \"The Origin of Species\" Darwin gives Alfred Russel\r\nWallace credit for coming to the same conclusion as himself, and states\r\nthat both had been at work on the same idea for more than a score of\r\nyears, but each working separately, unknown to the other.\r\n\r\nAndrew D. White says that the publication of Charles Darwin's book was\r\nlike plowing into an ant-hill. The theologians, rudely awakened from\r\ncomfort and repose, swarmed out angry, wrathful and confused. The air\r\nwas charged with challenges; and soggy sermons, books, pamphlets,\r\nbrochures and reviews, all were flying at the head of poor Darwin. The\r\nquestions that he had anticipated and answered at great length were\r\nflung off by men who had neither read his book nor expected an answer.\r\nThe idea that man had evolved from a lower form of animal especially was\r\nconsidered immensely funny, and jokes about \"monkey ancestry\" came from\r\nalmost every pulpit, convulsing the pews with laughter.\r\n\r\nIn passing, it may be well to note that Darwin nowhere says that man\r\ndescended from a monkey. He does, however, affirm his belief that they\r\nhad a common ancestor. One branch of the family took to the plains, and\r\nevolved into men, and the other branch remained in the woods and are\r\nmonkeys still. The expression, \"the missing link,\" is nowhere used by\r\nDarwin--that was a creation of one of his critics.\r\n\r\nWilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, summed up the argument against Darwinism\r\nin the \"Quarterly Review,\" by declaring that \"Darwin was guilty of an\r\nattempt to limit the power of God\"; that his book \"contradicts the\r\nBible\"; that \"it dishonors Nature.\" And in a speech before the British\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, where Darwin was not\r\npresent, the Bishop repeated his assertions, and turning to Huxley,\r\nasked if he were really descended from a monkey, and if so, was it on\r\nhis father's or his mother's side!\r\n\r\nHuxley sat silent, refusing to reply, but the audience began to clamor,\r\nand Huxley slowly arose, and calmly but forcibly said: \"I assert, and I\r\nrepeat, that a man has no reason to be ashamed of having an ape for his\r\ngrandfather. If there were an ancestor whom I should feel shame in\r\nrecalling, it would be a man, a man of restless and versatile intellect,\r\nwho, not content with success in his own sphere of activity, plunges\r\ninto scientific questions with which he has no real acquaintance, only\r\nto obscure them by an aimless rhetoric, and distract the attention of\r\nhis hearers from the real point at issue by eloquent digression and a\r\nskilful appeal to religious prejudices.\" Captain Fitz-Roy, who was\r\npresent at this meeting, was also called for.\r\n\r\nHe was now Admiral Fitz-Roy, and felt compelled to uphold his employer,\r\nthe State, so he upheld the State Religion and backed up the Bishop of\r\nOxford in his emptiness. \"I often had occasion on board the 'Beagle' to\r\nreprove Mr. Darwin for his disbelief in the First Chapter of Genesis,\"\r\nsolemnly said the Admiral. And Francis Darwin writes it down without\r\ncomment, probably to show how much the Volunteer Naturalist was helped,\r\naided and inspired by the Captain of the Expedition.\r\n\r\nBut the reply of Huxley was a shot heard round the world, and for the\r\nmost part the echo was passed along by the enemy.\r\n\r\nHuxley had insulted the Church, they said, and the adherents of the\r\nMosaic account took the attitude of outraged and injured innocence.\r\n\r\nAs for himself, Darwin said nothing. He ceased to attend the meetings of\r\nthe scientific societies, for fear that he would be drawn into debate,\r\nand while he felt a sincere gratitude for Huxley's friendship, he\r\ndeprecated the stern rebuke to the Bishop of Oxford. \"It will arouse the\r\nopposition to greater unreason,\" he said. And this was exactly what\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nEven the English Catholics took sides with Wilberforce, the Protestant,\r\nand Cardinal Manning organized a society \"to fight this new, so-called\r\nscience that declares there is no God and that Adam was an ape.\"\r\n\r\nEven the Non-Conformists and Jews came in, and there was the very\r\npeculiar spectacle witnessed of the Church of England, the\r\nNon-Conformists, the Catholics and the Jews aroused and standing as one\r\nman, against one quiet villager who remained at home and said, \"If my\r\nbook can not stand the bombardment, why then it deserves to go down and\r\nto be forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nSpurgeon declared that Darwinism was more dangerous than open and avowed\r\ninfidelity, since \"the one motive of the whole book is to dethrone God.\"\r\n\r\nRabbi Hirschberg wrote, \"Darwin's volume is plausible to the unthinking\r\nperson; but a deeper insight shows a mephitic desire to overthrow the\r\nMosaic books and to bury Judaism under a mass of fanciful rubbish.\"\r\n\r\nIn America Darwin had no more persistent critic than the Reverend DeWitt\r\nTalmage. For ten years Doctor Talmage scarcely preached a sermon without\r\nmaking reference to \"monkey ancestry\" and \"baboon unbelievers.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York \"Christian Advocate\" declared, \"Darwin is endeavoring to\r\nbecloud and befog the whole question of truth, and his book will be of\r\nshort life.\"\r\n\r\nAn eminent Catholic physician and writer, Doctor Constantine James,\r\nwrote a book of three hundred pages called \"Darwinism, or the Man-Ape.\"\r\nA copy of Doctor James' book being sent to Pope Pius the Ninth, the Pope\r\nacknowledged it in a personal letter, thanking the author for his\r\n\"masterly refutations of the vagaries of this man Darwin, wherein the\r\nCreator is left out of all things and man proclaims himself independent,\r\nhis own king, his own priest, his own God--then degrading man to the\r\nlevel of the brute by declaring he had the same origin, and this origin\r\nwas lifeless matter. Could folly and pride go further than to degrade\r\nScience into a vehicle for throwing contumely and disrespect on our holy\r\nreligion!\"\r\n\r\nThis makes rather interesting reading now for those who believe in the\r\ninfallibility of popes. So well did Doctor James' book sell, coupled\r\nwith the approbation of the Pope, that as late as Eighteen Hundred\r\nEighty-two a new and enlarged edition made its appearance, and the\r\nauthor was made a member of the Papal Order of Saint Sylvester. It is\r\nquite needless to add that those who read Doctor James' book refuting\r\nDarwin had never read Darwin, since \"The Origin of Species\" was placed\r\non the \"Index Expurgatorius\" in Eighteen Hundred Sixty. Some years\r\nafter, when it was discovered that Darwin had written other books, these\r\nwere likewise honored.\r\n\r\nThe book on barnacles being called to the attention of the Censor, that\r\nworthy exclaimed, \"Some new heresy, I dare say--put it on the 'Index!'\"\r\nAnd it was so done.\r\n\r\nThe success of Doctor James' book reveals the popularity of the form of\r\nreasoning that digests the refutation first, and the original\r\nproposition not at all.\r\n\r\nIn Eighteen Hundred Seventy-five, Gladstone in an address at Liverpool\r\nsaid, \"Upon the ground of what is called evolution, God is relieved from\r\nthe labor of creation and of governing the universe.\"\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer called Gladstone's attention to the fact that Sir Isaac\r\nNewton, with his law of gravitation and the physical science of\r\nastronomy, was open to the same charge.\r\n\r\nGladstone then took refuge in the \"Contemporary Review,\" and retreated\r\nin a cloud of words that had nothing to do with the subject.\r\n\r\nThomas Carlyle, who has facetiously been called a liberal thinker, had\r\nnot the patience to discuss Darwin's book seriously, but grew red in the\r\nface and hissed in falsetto when it was even mentioned. He wrote of\r\nDarwin as \"the apostle of dirt,\" and said, \"He thinks his grandfather\r\nwas a chimpanzee, and I suppose he is right--leastwise, I am not the one\r\nto deprive him of the honor.\"\r\n\r\nScathing criticisms were uttered on Darwin's ideas, both on the platform\r\nand in print, by Doctor Noah Porter of Yale, Doctor Hodge of Princeton,\r\nand Doctor Tayler Lewis of Union College. Agassiz, the man who was\r\nregarded as the foremost scientist in America, thought he had to choose\r\nbetween orthodoxy and Darwinism, and he chose orthodoxy. His gifted son\r\ntried to rescue his father from the grip of prejudice, and later\r\nendeavored to free his name from the charge that he could not change\r\nhis mind, but alas! Louis Agassiz's words were expressed in print, and\r\nwidely circulated.\r\n\r\nThere were two men in America whose names stand out like beacon-lights\r\nbecause they had the courage to speak up loud and clear for Charles\r\nDarwin while the pack was baying the loudest. These men were Doctor Asa\r\nGray, who influenced the Appletons to publish an American edition of\r\n\"The Origin of Species,\" and Professor Edward L. Youmans, who gave up\r\nhis own brilliant lecture work in order that he might stand by Darwin,\r\nSpencer, Huxley and Wallace.\r\n\r\nFor the man who was known as \"a Darwinian\" there was no place in the\r\nAmerican Lyceum. Shut out from addressing the public by word of mouth,\r\nYoumans founded a magazine that he might express himself, and he fired a\r\nmonthly broadside from his \"Popular Science Monthly.\" And it is good to\r\nremember that the faith of Youmans was not without its reward. He lived\r\nto see his periodical grow from a confessed failure--a bill of expense\r\nthat took his monthly salary to maintain--to a paying property that made\r\nits owner passing rich.\r\n\r\nGray, too, outlived the charge of infidelity, and was not forced to\r\nresign his position as Professor at Harvard, as was freely prophesied he\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nAs for Darwin himself, he stood the storm of misunderstanding and abuse\r\nwithout scorn or resentment.\r\n\r\n\"Truth must fight its way,\" he said; \"and this gauntlet of criticism is\r\nall for the best. What is true in my book will survive, and that which\r\nis error will be blown away as chaff.\" He was neither exalted by praise\r\nnor cast down by censure. For Huxley, Lyell, Hooker, Spencer, Wallace\r\nand Asa Gray he had a great and profound love--what they said affected\r\nhim deeply, and their steadfast kindness at times touched him to tears.\r\nFor the great, seething, outside world that had not thought along\r\nabstruse scientific lines, and could not, he cared little.\r\n\r\n\"How can we expect them to see as we do,\" he wrote to Gray; \"it has\r\ntaken me thirty years of toil and research to come to these conclusions.\r\nTo have the unthinking masses accept all that I say would be calamity:\r\nthis opposition is a winnowing process, and all a part of the Law of\r\nEvolution that works for good.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor forty years Darwin lived in the same house at Down, in the same\r\nquiet, simple way. Here he lived and worked, and the world gradually\r\ncame to him, figuratively and literally. Gradually it dawned upon the\r\ntheologians that a God who could set in motion natural laws that worked\r\nwith beneficent and absolute regularity was just as great as if He had\r\nmade everything at once and then stopped.\r\n\r\nThe miracle of evolution is just as sublime as the miracle of Adam's\r\ndeep sleep and the making of a woman out of a man's rib. The faith of\r\nthe scientist who sees order, regularity and unfailing law is quite as\r\ngreat as that of a preacher who believes everything he reads in a book.\r\nThe scientist is a man with faith, plus.\r\n\r\nWhen Darwin died, in Eighteen Hundred Eighty-two, Darwinism and\r\ninfidelity were words no longer synonymous.\r\n\r\nThe discrepancies and inconsistencies of the theories of Darwin were\r\nseen by him as by his critics, and he was ever willing to admit the\r\ndoubt. None of his disciples was as ready to modify his opinions as he.\r\n\"We must beware of making science dogmatic,\" he once said to Haeckel.\r\n\r\nAnd at another time he said, \"I would feel I had gone too far were it\r\nnot for Wallace, who came to the same conclusions, quite independently\r\nof me.\" Darwin's mind was simple and childlike. He was a student,\r\nalways learning, and no one was too mean or too poor for him to learn\r\nfrom. The patience, persistency and untiring industry of the man,\r\ncombined with the daring imagination that saw the thing clearly long\r\nbefore he could prove it, and the gentle forbearance in the presence of\r\nunkindness and misunderstanding, won the love of a nation.\r\n\r\nHe wished to be buried in the churchyard at Down, but at his death, by\r\nuniversal acclaim, the gates of Westminster swung wide to receive the\r\ndust of the man whom bishops, clergy and laymen alike had reviled.\r\nDarwin had won, not alone because he was right, but because his was a\r\ntruly great and loving soul--a soul without the least resentment.\r\n\r\nArchdeacon Farrar, quoting Huxley, said, \"I would rather be Darwin and\r\nbe right than be Premier of England--we have had and will have many\r\nPremiers, but the world will never have another Darwin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ERNST HAECKEL]\r\n\r\nHAECKEL\r\n\r\n\r\n     Nothing seems to me better adapted than this monistic perspective\r\n     to give us the proper standard and the broad outlook which we need\r\n     in the solution of the vast enigmas that surround us. It not only\r\n     clearly indicates the true place of a man in Nature, but it\r\n     dissipates the prevalent illusion of man's supreme importance and\r\n     arrogance with which he sets himself apart from the illimitable\r\n     universe, and exalts himself to the position of its most valuable\r\n     element. This boundless presumption of conceited man has misled him\r\n     into making himself \"the image of God,\" claiming an \"eternal life\"\r\n     for his ephemeral personality, and imagining that he possesses\r\n     unlimited \"freedom of will.\" The ridiculous imperial folly of\r\n     Caligula is but a special form of man's arrogant assumption of\r\n     divinity. Only when we have abandoned this untenable illusion, and\r\n     taken up the correct cosmological perspective, can we hope to reach\r\n     the solution of the Riddle of the Universe.\r\n\r\n     --_Haeckel_\r\n\r\n\r\nHAECKEL\r\n\r\nThere was a man, once upon a day, who lived in East Aurora and kept\r\na store. He sold everything from cough-syrup to blue ribbon; and some of\r\nthe things he sold on time to philosophers who sat on nail-kegs every\r\nevening, and settled the coal strike.\r\n\r\nAnd in due course of time the storekeeper compromised with his\r\ncreditors, at twenty-nine cents on the dollar.\r\n\r\nSome say the man went busted a-purpose to quit business and get out of\r\nEast Aurora. And he himself generally allowed the opinion to gain ground\r\nin later years that he had planned his life throughout, from start to\r\nfinish, thus proving the supremacy of the will. Yet others there be, and\r\nmen of worth and social standing in the village--known for miles up the\r\ncreek as persons of probity--who claim that it was too much confidence\r\nin the Genus Smart-Setter, and trotting horses at the County Fairs, that\r\nmade it possible for our friend to avail himself of the Bankruptcy Act.\r\nStill others, too inert to follow the winding ways of a strange career\r\nand give reasons, dispose of the matter by simply saying,\r\n\"Providence!\"--rolling their eyes upward, then walking out, leaving the\r\nwordy contestants humiliated and undone.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that I am interested in this chapter of Ancient History:\r\nand in truth, I myself occasionally ornament the nail-kegs. I claim it\r\nwas neither Providence nor astute planning that mapped this man's\r\ncourse, but Providence, Planning and Luck; and I silence the adversary,\r\nfor the time, by citing these facts:\r\n\r\nVery shortly after Providence and the Sheriff of Erie County--whose\r\nname, by the way, was Grover Cleveland--had disposed of the East Aurora\r\ngrocery, our friend met a man in Buffalo who had a sweeping scar on his\r\nchin, a wonderful secret, and nothing else worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nThis man secured his assets in Germany; he got them while attending the\r\nUniversity of Jena. The secret was gotten by an understanding with a\r\nprofessor; the scar was received through a misunderstanding with a\r\nstudent. The secret was a plan by which you could make glucose from\r\ncorn. In Germany it was only a laboratory experiment, because there was\r\nno corn in Europe to speak of.\r\n\r\nHere we had corn to burn, since in that very year the farmers of Iowa\r\nwere using corn for their fuel. Glucose is the active saccharine\r\nprinciple in maize, but it does not become active until the corn is\r\ntreated chemically in a certain way, just as honey is not honey until a\r\nbee puts it through his Maeterlinck laboratory.\r\n\r\nGlucose is a food; it can be used for all purposes where sugar is\r\nused--in degree, at least.\r\n\r\nAnd every living person on earth uses sugar as food every day! Our\r\nex-grocer knew all about Hambletonian Ten and Dexter; but dextrine,\r\ndextrose and glucose were out of his class. Yet he realized that if\r\nsugar could be made from corn, there was a fortune in it for somebody.\r\nOpportunity, we are told, knocks once at each man's door. Our David\r\nHarum was forty, past, and he had often thought Opportunity was tapping,\r\nbut when he opened wide the door, darkness there, and nothing more!\r\nOpportunity had knocked, but was too timid to stay. This time, he heard\r\nthe knock, and when he opened up the door, Opportunity made a rush for\r\nhim, grabbed him by the collar--catch-as-catch-can--in a grip he could\r\nnot shake off.\r\n\r\nMr. Harum examined as best he could the glucose the German student had\r\nmade, and then he watched the whole experiment worked out over again.\r\nWhat the particular ingredients were, was still a secret. The man would\r\nnot sell out; he wanted to organize a manufactory and take a certain per\r\ncent of the profits. David had saved a thousand dollars out of the wreck\r\nat East Aurora; but he knew if he could show certain men that the scheme\r\nwas genuine, he would be able to raise more.\r\n\r\nFive thousand dollars was secured. But the men who advanced the four\r\nthousand dollars demanded an insurance-policy on the life of the German\r\nchemist. This appealed to our David Harum as an excellent plan: if the\r\nman who held the secret should die, all would be lost save honor. They\r\ninsured the life of the chemist for twenty thousand dollars. In a month\r\nafter, he was killed in a railroad wreck on a Sunday School excursion.\r\nAnd the moral is--but never mind that now.\r\n\r\nThe twenty thousand dollars' insurance was paid to David Harum. He\r\nrepaid his friends immediately their four thousand dollars, and reserved\r\nfor himself, very properly, the sixteen thousand dollars to cover\r\nexpenses. He then started for Jena.\r\n\r\nArriving there, he found that the making of glucose was no special\r\nsecret, and to manufacture it on a large scale was simply a matter of\r\nevolving the right kind of system and a plant. He hired a young German\r\nchemist, who had just graduated, for a matter of, say, a thousand\r\ndollars a year and expenses, and the two started back for America.\r\n\r\nFrom this arose the Glucose Industry in the United States. In ten years'\r\ntime twelve million dollars was invested in the business; and in\r\nNineteen Hundred Three more than a hundred million dollars was invested.\r\nOur East Aurora hero sold out his interests, in Eighteen Hundred Ninety,\r\nfor some such bagatelle as thirteen million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe young German student is now back at the Jena university, taking a\r\npost-graduate course in chemistry--the first one is still dead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am told that there be folks who pooh-pooh college training and sneeze\r\non mention of a University degree. Usually these good people have no\r\nUniversity degrees, but have been greatly helped by those who have.\r\n\r\nOur David Harums are not college-bred--a statement which I trust will go\r\nunchallenged.\r\n\r\nThe true type of German student is made in Germany, and when taken out\r\nof his native environment, often evolves into something less beautiful.\r\n\r\nHis lack of worldly ambition is his chief claim to immortality. His\r\nwants are few; he rises early and works late; he is most practical in\r\nhis own particular specialty, but often most impractical outside of it;\r\nhe is plodding, patient, painstaking, and will follow a microbe you can\r\nnot see, as Thompson-Seton's hunter followed the famous Kootenay ram.\r\n\r\nThis simple reverence for the truth--this passion for an idea--this\r\ndesire to know--these things have given to the world some of its richest\r\ntreasures. We are aware of what the Rockfellers have done, but we seldom\r\nstop to think of the unknown laboratory students, who made possible such\r\nvast and far-reaching institutions as the Standard Oil Company, the\r\nCarborundum Company, the Amalgamated Copper Company, and the various\r\nbeet-sugar factories, that give work to thousands, and lift whole\r\ncounties, and even some States, from penury to plenty.\r\n\r\nGermany honors her scholars; and one of the strongest instincts of her\r\nnational life is her search for genius. Initiative is originality in\r\nmotion. Originality is too rare to flout and scout. Not all originality\r\nis good, but all good things, so far as humanity is concerned, were once\r\noriginal. That is to say, they were the work of Genius.\r\n\r\nGermany's sympathy for the best in thought has occasionally been broken\r\nin upon by pigmy rulers, who, for the moment, had a giant's power, so it\r\nseems hardly possible that a government which encouraged Goethe should\r\nhave banished Wagner. The greatness of Kant was largely owing to the\r\nfact that he was set apart by Frederick and made free to do his work;\r\nand at this time, not another monarchy in the world would have had the\r\ninsight to keep its coarse hands off this little man with the big head\r\nand the brain of a prophet.\r\n\r\nAnd as Kant was the greatest and most original thinker of his time, so\r\ntoday does a German University house the world's greatest living\r\nscientist. Ernst Haeckel has been Professor of Natural History at Jena\r\nfor forty-two years. All the efforts of various other Universities to\r\nlure him away have failed. He even declined to listen to the siren song\r\nof Major Pond, and only smiled at the big baits dangled on long poles\r\nfrom Cook County, Illinois.\r\n\r\n\"I have everything I want, everything I can use is right here; why\r\nshould I think of uprooting my life?\" he asked. And yet, Jena, there in\r\nthe shadow of the Thuringian Mountains, is only a little town of less\r\nthan ten thousand inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn Nineteen Hundred Three, there were five hundred pupils registered at\r\nJena, as against four thousand at Harvard, five thousand at Ann Arbor,\r\nand nearly the same at Lincoln, Nebraska.\r\n\r\nIt will not do to assume that those who graduate at big colleges are big\r\nmen, any more than to imagine that folks who reside in big towns are\r\nbigger than those who live in little villages. Perhaps the greatest men\r\nhave come from the small colleges: I believe the small colleges admit\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nAnd surely there is plenty of good argument handy, in way of proof; for\r\nwhile Harvard has her Barrett Wendell, with his caveat on clearness,\r\nforce and elegance; and Ann Arbor has Cicero Trueblood, Professor of\r\nOratory, whose official duty it is to formulate the College Yell; yet\r\nAmherst, with her scant five hundred pupils, has Professor David P.\r\nTodd, the greatest astronomer of the New World. I really wonder\r\nsometimes what a University that stands in fear of Triggsology would do\r\nwith Professor Ernst Haeckel, whose disregard for tradition is very\r\ndecidedly Ingersollian! The actual fact is, Ernst Haeckel, the world's\r\ngreatest thinker, belongs in the little town of Jena, in Germany. At the\r\nvillage of Coniston, you see the little hall where Ruskin read the best\r\nthings he ever wrote, to a dozen or two people.\r\n\r\nAt Hammersmith, the limit of a William Morris audience was about a\r\nhundred. At Jena, Ernst Haeckel sits secure in his little lecture-hall,\r\nand speaks or reads to fifty or sixty students, but the printed word\r\ngoes to millions, so his thoughts here expressed in Jena are shots heard\r\nround the world.\r\n\r\nAmerican pedagogic institutions are mendicant--they depend upon private\r\ncharity and are endowed by pious pirates and beneficent buccaneers. The\r\nindividuals who made these institutions possible very naturally have a\r\ncontrolling voice in their management. The colleges in America that are\r\nnot supported by direct mendicancy depend upon the dole of the\r\nlegislator, and woe betide the pedagogic principal who offends the\r\northodox vote. His supplies are cut short, and purse-strings pucker\r\nuntil his voice moderates to a monotone and he dilutes his views to a\r\ndull neutral tint. I do not know a University in the United States that\r\nwould not place Ernst Haeckel on half-rations, and make him fight for\r\nhis life, or else he would be discharged and be reduced to the sad\r\nnecessity of tilting windmills in popular lecture courses for the\r\nedification of agrarians. The German Government seeks to make men free.\r\nIt even gives them the privilege of being absurd; for pioneers sometimes\r\ntake the wrong track. We do not scout Columbus because his domestic\r\nvoyages were failures; nor because he sought one thing and found\r\nanother, and died without knowing the difference.\r\n\r\nHaeckel's wants are all supplied; what he needs in the way of apparatus\r\nor material is his for the asking; he travels at will the round world\r\nover; visions of old age and yawning almshouses are not for him. He owns\r\nhimself--he does what he wishes, he says what he thinks, and neither\r\npriest nor politician dare cry, hist! So we get the paradox: the only\r\nperfect freedom is to be found in a monarchy. \"A Republic,\" says\r\nSchopenhauer, \"is a land that is ruled by the many--that is to say, by\r\nthe incompetent.\" But Schopenhauer, of course, knew nothing of the\r\nAmerican primary, devised by altruistic Hibernians for the purpose of\r\nthwarting the incompetent many.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nErnst Haeckel was born in Eighteen Hundred Thirty-four, hence he is just\r\nseventy-seven years old at this writing. His parents were plain people,\r\nneither rich nor poor--and of such is the Kingdom of Heaven. The\r\ngreatest error one can make in life is not to be well born; failing in\r\nthis, a man struggles through life under an awful handicap.\r\n\r\nHaeckel formed the habit of steady, systematic work in youth, and\r\nuntiring effort has been the rule of his life. Man was made to be well,\r\nand he was made to work. It is only work--which is the constant effort\r\nto retain equilibrium--that makes life endurable. So we find Haeckel\r\nnow, at near fourscore years, a model of manly vigor, with all the\r\neager, curious, receptive qualities of youth--a happy man, but one who\r\nknows that happiness lies on the way to Heaven, and not in arriving\r\nthere and sitting down to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nErnst Haeckel gathers his manna fresh every day. I believe Haeckel\r\nenjoys his pipe and mug after the day's work is done; but for stimulants\r\nin a general sense, he has no use. In his book on Ceylon, he attributes\r\nhis escape from the jungle fever, from which most of his party suffered,\r\nto the fact that he never used strong drink, and ate sparingly.\r\n\r\nHe is jealous of the sunshine--a great walker--works daily with hoe and\r\nspade in his garden; and breathes deeply, pounding on his chest, when\r\ngoing from his house to the college, in a way that causes considerable\r\namusement among the fledglings. Tall, spare rather than stout, bronzed,\r\nactive, wearing shoes with thick soles, plain gray clothes, often\r\naccompanied by a half-dozen young men, he is a common figure on the\r\nroads that wind out of Jena, and lose themselves amid the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature of the man is his animation. He is full of\r\ngood cheer, and acts as if he were expecting to discover something\r\nwonderful very soon.\r\n\r\nTo find the balance between play and work has been the aim of his life;\r\nand surely, he has pretty nearly discovered it.\r\n\r\nOnce when a caller asked him what he considered the greatest achievement\r\nof his life, he took out of his pocket a leather case containing a\r\nbronze medal, and proudly passed it around.\r\n\r\nThis medal was presented to him in the year Eighteen Hundred Fifty-nine,\r\nin token of a running high jump--the world's record at the time, or not,\r\nas the case may be. Haeckel is essentially an out-of-door man, as\r\nopposed to the philosopher who works in a stuffy room, and grows\r\nround-shouldered over his microscope. \"I may entrust laboratory analyses\r\nto others, but there is one thing I will never let another do for me,\r\nand that is take my daily walk a-field,\" he once said.\r\n\r\nWhile lecturing he sits at a table and simply talks in a very informal\r\nway; often purposely arousing a discussion, or awakening a sleepy\r\nstudent with a question. Yet on occasion he can speak to a multitude,\r\nand, like Huxley, rise to the occasion. Oratory, however, he considers\r\nrather dangerous, as the speaker is usually influenced by the opinions\r\nof the audience, and is apt to grow more emphatic than exact--to\r\ngenerate more heat than light.\r\n\r\nThe comparison of Haeckel with Huxley is not out of place. He has been\r\ncalled the Huxley of Germany, just as Huxley was called the Haeckel of\r\nEngland. In temperament, they were much alike; although Haeckel perhaps\r\ndoes not use quite so much aqua fortis in his ink. Yet I can well\r\nimagine that if he were at a convention where the Bishop of Oxford would\r\nlevel at him a few theological spitballs, he would answer, unerringly,\r\nwith a sling and a few smooth pebbles from the brook. And possibly,\r\nknowing himself, this is why he keeps out of society, and avoids all\r\npublic gatherings where pseudo-science is exploited.\r\n\r\nThere is a superstition that really great men are quite oblivious of\r\ntheir greatness, and that the pride of achievement is not among their\r\nassets. Nothing could be wider of the mark. When Ernst Haeckel was\r\nasked, \"Who is your favorite author?\" he very promptly answered, \"Ernst\r\nHaeckel.\"\r\n\r\nHis study is a big square room on the top floor of one of the college\r\nbuildings; and in this room is a bookcase extending from ceiling to\r\nfloor, given up to his own works.\r\n\r\nCopies of every edition and of all translations are here.\r\n\r\nAnd in a special case are the original manuscripts, solidly bound in\r\nboards, as carefully preserved as were the \"literary remains\" of William\r\nMorris, guarded with the instincts of a bibliophile.\r\n\r\nOf the size of this Haeckel collection one can make a guess when it is\r\nstated that the man has written and published over fifty different\r\nbooks. These vary in size from simple lectures to volumes of a thousand\r\npages. His work entitled, \"The Natural History of Creation,\" has been\r\ntranslated into twelve languages, and has gone through fifteen editions\r\nin Germany, and about half as many in England.\r\n\r\nThe last book issued by Professor Haeckel was that intensely interesting\r\nessay, \"The Riddle of the Universe,\" which was written in Eighteen\r\nHundred Ninety-nine, in two months' time, during his summer vacation. He\r\ngave it out that he had gone to Italy, denied himself to all visitors\r\nwho knew that he had not, and answered no letters. He reached his study\r\nevery morning at six o'clock and locked himself in, and there he\r\nremained until eight o'clock at night. At noon one of his children\r\nbrought him his lunch.\r\n\r\nUnlike Herbert Spencer, whose later writings were all dictated--and very\r\nslowly and painstakingly at that--Haeckel writes with his own hand, and\r\nwhen the fit is on, he turns off manuscript at the rate of from two to\r\nfour thousand words a day. In writing \"The Riddle of the Universe,\" he\r\ntook no exercise save to go up on the roof, breathing deeply and\r\npounding his chest, varying the pounding by reaching his arms above his\r\nhead and stretching. However, after a few weeks the villagers and\r\nvisitors got to looking for him with opera-glasses; and he ceased going\r\non the roof, taking his calisthenics at the open window.\r\n\r\nThis exercise of reaching and stretching until you lift yourself on\r\ntiptoe, he goes out of his way to recommend in his book on\r\n\"Development,\" wherein he says, \"There is a tendency as the years pass\r\nfor the internal organs to drop, but the individual who will daily go\r\nthrough the motion of reaching for fruit on limbs of trees that are\r\nabove his head, standing on tiptoe and slowly stretching up and up,\r\noccasionally throwing his head back and looking straight up, will of\r\nnecessity breathe deeply, exercise the diaphragm, and I believe in most\r\ncases will ward off diseases and keep old age awaiting for long.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a little commonsense advice given by a physician who is also a\r\ngreat scientist. To try it will cost you nothing--no apparatus is\r\nrequired--just throw open the window and reach up and up and up, first\r\nwith one arm, then the other, and then both arms. \"The person who does\r\nthis daily for five minutes as a habit will probably have no need of a\r\nphysician,\" adds Haeckel, and with this sage remark he dismisses the\r\nsubject, branching off into an earnest talk on radiolaria.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaeckel was educated for a physician and began his career by practising\r\nmedicine. But his heart was not really in the work; he soon arrived at\r\nthe very sane conclusion that constant dwelling on the pathological was\r\nnot worth while. \"Hereafter I'll devote my time to the normal, not the\r\nabnormal and distempered. The sick should learn to keep well,\" he wrote\r\na friend.\r\n\r\nAnd again, \"If an individual is so lacking in will that he can not\r\nprovide for himself, then his dissolution is no calamity to either\r\nhimself, the State or the race.\" This was written in his twenties, and\r\nseems to sound rather sophomorish, but the idea of the boy is still with\r\nthe old man, for in \"The Riddle of the Universe\" he says, \"The final\r\neffect upon the race by the preservation of the unfit, through increased\r\nskill in surgery and medicine, is not yet known.\" In another place he\r\nthrows in a side remark, thus: \"Our almshouses, homes for imbeciles, and\r\nasylums where the hopelessly insane often outlive their keepers, may be\r\na mistake, save as these things minister to the spirit of altruism which\r\nprompts their support. Let a wiser generation answer!\"\r\n\r\nDoubtless Haeckel could make a good argument in favor of the doctors if\r\nhe wished, but probably if asked to do so his answer would paraphrase\r\nRobert Ingersoll, when that gentleman was taken to task for unfairness\r\ntowards Moses, \"Young man, you seem to forget that I am not the attorney\r\nof Moses--don't worry, there are more than ten millions of men looking\r\nafter his case.\" Ernst Haeckel is not the attorney for either the\r\ndoctors or the clergy.\r\n\r\nIt was Darwin and \"The Origin of Species\" that tipped the beam for\r\nHaeckel in favor of science. Very shortly after Darwin's great book was\r\nissued, in the year Eighteen Hundred Fifty-nine, a chance copy of the\r\nwork fell into the hands of our young physician. He read and spoke\r\nEnglish, and in a general way was interested in biology.\r\n\r\nAs he read of Darwin's observations and experiments the heavens seemed\r\nto open before him.\r\n\r\nThings he had vaguely felt, Darwin stated, and thoughts that had been\r\nhis, Darwin expressed. \"I might have written much of this book, myself,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nThe love of Nature had been upon the young man almost from his babyhood.\r\nAll children love flowers and mix easily with the wonderful things that\r\nare found in woods and fields. At twelve years of age Ernst had formed a\r\ngoodly herbarium, and was making a collection of bugs, and not knowing\r\ntheir names or even that they had names, he began naming them himself.\r\nLater it came to him with a shock of surprise and disappointment that\r\nthe bugs and beetles had already had the attention of scholars. But he\r\ngot even by declaring that he would hunt out some of the tiny things the\r\nscholars had overlooked and classify them. Every man imagines himself\r\nthe first man, and to think that he is Adam and that he has to go\r\nforth, get acquainted with things and name them, reveals the true bent\r\nof the scientist.\r\n\r\nDoctor Haeckel was ripe for Darwin's book. He was looking for it, and it\r\ntook only a slight jolt to dislodge him from the medical profession and\r\nallow the Law of Affinity to do the rest.\r\n\r\nWallace had written Darwin's book under another name, and if these men\r\nhad not written it, Haeckel surely would, for it was all packed away in\r\nhis heart and head. As Darwin had studied and classified the Cirripedia,\r\nso would he write an essay on Rhizopods. Luck was with him--luck is\r\nalways with the man of purpose. He had an opportunity to travel through\r\nItaly as medical caretaker to a rich invalid. Sickness surely has its\r\nuses; and rich invalids are not wholly a mistake on the part of Setebos.\r\nHaeckel secured the leisure and the opportunity to round up his\r\nRhizopods.\r\n\r\nHe presented the work to the University of Jena, because this was the\r\nUniversity that Goethe attended, and the gods of Haeckel were\r\nthree--Goethe, Darwin and Johannes Muller.\r\n\r\nMuller was instructor in Zoology at Berlin, a man quite of the Agassiz\r\ntype who made himself beloved by the boys because he was what he was--a\r\nboy in heart, with a man's head and the soul of a saint. Some one said\r\nof Muller, \"To him every look into a microscope was a service to God.\"\r\nIn his reverent attitude he was like Linnæus, who fell on his knees on\r\nfirst beholding the English gorse in full flower, and thanked Heaven\r\nthat such a moment of divine joy was his.\r\n\r\nMuller was a Jena man, too, and he gave Haeckel letters to the bigwigs.\r\nThe wise men of Jena discovered that there was merit in Haeckel's\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nOriginal investigators are rare--most of us write about the men who have\r\ndone things, or else we tell about what they have done, and so we reach\r\ngreatness by hitching our wagon to a star. For the essay on Rhizopods,\r\nHaeckel was made Professor Extraordinary of the University of Jena. This\r\nwas in Eighteen Hundred Sixty-two; Haeckel was then twenty-eight years\r\nold; there he is today, after a service of forty-nine years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaeckel is married, with a big brood of children and grandchildren about\r\nhim. Some of his own children and the grandchildren are about the same\r\nage, for Haeckel has two broods, having had two wives, both of whom\r\nsympathized with the Teddine philosophy.\r\n\r\nWith the whole household, including servants, the great scientist is on\r\nterms of absolute good camaraderie. The youngsters ride on his back; the\r\nolder girls decorate him with garlands; the boys work with him in the\r\ngarden, or together they tramp the fields and climb the hills.\r\n\r\nBut when it comes to study he goes to his own room in the Zoology\r\nBuilding, enters in and locks the door. When he travels he travels\r\nalone, without companion or secretary. Travel to him means intense work;\r\nand intense work means to him intense pleasure. Solitude seems necessary\r\nto close, consecutive thinking; and in the solitude of travel, through\r\njungle, forest, crowded city, or across wide oceans, Haeckel finds his\r\ntrue and best self. Then it is that he puts his soul in touch with the\r\nUniversal and realizes most fully Goethe's oft-repeated dictum, \"All is\r\none.\" And, indeed, to Goethe must be given the credit of preparing the\r\nmind of Haeckel for Darwinism.\r\n\r\nIn his book, \"The Freedom and Science of Teaching,\" Haeckel applies the\r\npoetic monistic ideas of Goethe to biology and then to sociology. \"All\r\nis one.\" And this oneness that everywhere exists is simply a\r\ndifferentiation of the original single cell.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the cell mirrors the evolution of the species: the\r\nevolution of the individual mirrors the evolution of the race.\r\n\r\nThis law, expressed by Goethe, is the controlling shibboleth in all\r\nHaeckel's philosophy.\r\n\r\nIn embryology he has proved it to the satisfaction of the scientific\r\nworld. When he applies it to sociology our Bellamys are looking backward\r\nto Sir Thomas More, and expect a sudden transformation to a Utopia, not\r\nunlike the change which the good old preachers used to tell us we would\r\nexperience \"in the twinkling of an eye.\"\r\n\r\nHaeckel builds on Darwin and shows that as the Cirripedia which makes\r\nthe bottom of the ocean, the coral \"insect\" which rears dangerous reefs\r\nand even mountain-ranges, and Rhizopods that make the chalk cliffs\r\npossible, did not change the earth's crust in the twinkling of an eye,\r\nso neither can the efforts of man instantly change the social condition.\r\nSouls do not make lightning changes. Karl Marx thought society would\r\nchange in the twinkling of a ballot, but he was not a Monist, and\r\ntherefore did not realize that humanity is a solidarity of souls,\r\nevolved from very lowly forms and still slowly ascending.\r\n\r\nAnd the beauty of it is that the Marxians are helping the race to\r\nascend, by supplying it an Ideal, even if they fail utterly to work\r\ntheir lightning change. In the end there is no defeat for any man or any\r\nthing. When men deserve the Ideal they will get it. So long as they\r\nprefer beer, tobacco, brawls and slums, these things will be supplied.\r\nWhen they get enough of these, something better will be evolved. The\r\nstupidity of George the Third was a necessary factor in the evolution of\r\nfreedom for America. All is one; all is Good; and all is God.\r\n\r\nThe Marxians will eventually win, but by Fabian methods, and Socialism\r\nwill come under another name. As opposed to Herbert Spencer, Haeckel\r\ndoes not admit the Unknowable, although, of course, he realizes the\r\nunknown. No man ever had a fuller faith, and if there is any such thing\r\nas a glorious deathbed it must come to men of this type who believe not\r\nonly that all is well for themselves, but for every one else. How a\r\ndeathbed could be \"glorious\" for a man who had perfect faith in his own\r\nsalvation and an equally perfect faith in the damnation of most\r\neverybody else, is difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nA true Monist would rather be in Hell asking for water than in Heaven\r\ndenying it.\r\n\r\nHe loves humanity because he is Humanity, and he loves God because he is\r\nGod. As a single drop of water mirrors the globe, so does a single man\r\nmirror the race. And the evolution, biological and sociological, of the\r\nman mirrors the evolution of the species.\r\n\r\nWhen one once grasps the beauty and splendor of the monistic idea, how\r\nmean and small become all those little, fearsome \"schemes of salvation,\"\r\nwhereby men were to be separated and impassable gulfs fixed between\r\nthem. Those who fix gulfs here and now are hotly intent on showing that\r\nGod will fix gulfs hereafter; thus we see how man is continually\r\ncreating God in his own image.\r\n\r\nHis idea of God's justice is always built on his own; and as usually our\r\ndeities are more or less inherited, heirlooms of the past, we see that\r\nit is not at all strange that men should be better than their religion.\r\nThey drag their dead creeds behind them like a stagecoach, with\r\npreachers and priests on top; kings and nobles inside; and coffins full\r\nof past sins in the boot. A man is always better than his creed--unless\r\nhe makes his creed new every day. These hand-me-down religions seldom\r\nfit, and professional theology, it seems to me, is mostly a dealing in\r\nol' clo'.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the month of September, Nineteen Hundred Four, Haeckel was a delegate\r\nto the Freethinkers' Congress at Rome. To hold such a convention in the\r\nEternal City, right under the eaves of the Vatican, was surely a trifle\r\n\"indelicate,\" to use the words of the Pope. And it was no wonder that at\r\nthe close of the Congress the Pope at once ordered a sacred\r\nhousecleaning, a divine fumigation.\r\n\r\nForty years ago he would have acted before the Congress convened, and\r\nnot afterward. Special mass was held in every one of the Catholic\r\nChurches in Rome, \"partially to atone for the insult done to Almighty\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\nOver three thousand delegates were present at the Congress, every\r\ncivilized country being represented.\r\n\r\nA committee was named to decorate the statue of Bruno that stands on the\r\nspot where he was burned for declaring that the earth revolved, and that\r\nthe stars were not God's jewels hung in the sky each night by angels.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Haeckel said:\r\n\r\n\"This Congress is historic. It marks a white milepost in the onward and\r\nupward march of Freedom.\r\n\r\n\"We have met in Rome not accidentally or yet incidentally, but\r\npurposely. We have met here to show the world that times have changed,\r\nthat the earth revolves, and to prove to ourselves in an impressive and\r\nundeniable way that the power of superstition is crippled, and at last\r\nScience and Free Speech need no longer cringe and crawl. We respect the\r\nChurch for what she is, but our manhood must now realize that it is no\r\nlonger the slave and tool of entrenched force and power that abrogates\r\nto itself the name of religion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Haeckel attitude of mind is essentially one of faith--Haeckel's hope\r\nfor the race is sublime. There are several things we do not know, but we\r\nmay know some time, just as men know things that children do not.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we are only children in the kindergarten of God. And this garden\r\nwhere we work and play is our own. The boy of ten, or even the man of\r\nsixty, may never know, but there will come men greater than these and\r\nthey will understand. The Monist, the man who believes in the One--the\r\nAll--is essentially religious.\r\n\r\nHaeckel has chosen this word Monism, as opposed to theism, deism,\r\nmaterialism, spiritism.\r\n\r\nDoctor Paul Carus is today the ablest American exponent of Monism, and\r\nto him it is a positive religion. If Monism could make men of the superb\r\nmental type of Paul Carus, well might we place the subject on a\r\ncompulsory basis and introduce it into our public schools. But Haeckel\r\nand Carus believe quite as much in freedom as in Monism. All violence of\r\ndirection is contrary to growth, and delays evolution just that much.\r\n\r\nThe One of which we are part and particle--single cells, if you\r\nplease--is constantly working for its own good. We advance individually\r\nas we lie low in the Lord's hand and allow ourselves to be receivers and\r\nconveyors of the Divine Will.\r\n\r\nAnd we ourselves are the Divine Will. The contemplation of this divinity\r\nexcites the religious emotions of awe, veneration, wonder and of\r\nworship. It is a world of correlation. The All is right here. There is\r\nno outside force or energy; no god or supreme being that looks on,\r\ninterferes, dictates and decides. To admit that there is an outside\r\npower, something uncorrelated, is to invite fear, apprehension,\r\nuncertainty and terror. This undissolved residuum is the nest-egg of\r\nsuperstition. The man who believes that God is the Whole, and that every\r\nman is a necessary part of the Whole, has no need to placate or please\r\nan intangible Something. All he has to do is to be true to his own\r\nnature, to live his own life, to understand himself. This takes us back\r\nto the Socratic maxim, \"Know Thyself.\" No man ever expressed one phase\r\nof Monism so well and beautifully as Emerson has in his \"Essay on\r\nCompensation.\" This intelligence in which we are bathed rights every\r\nwrong, equalizes every injustice, balances every perversion, punishes\r\nthe wrong and rewards the right. The Universe is self-lubricating and\r\nautomatic. The Greeks clearly beheld the sublime truths of Compensation\r\nwhen they pictured Nemesis. It is absurd to punish--leave it to\r\nNemesis--she never forgets--nothing can escape her.\r\n\r\nOur duties lie in service to ourselves, and we best serve self by\r\nserving humanity. This is the only religion that pays compound interest\r\nto both borrower and lender. Worship Humanity and you honor yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd the world has ever dimly perceived this, for history honors no men\r\nsave those who have given their lives that others might live. The\r\nsaviors of the world are only those who loved Humanity more than all\r\nelse. All men who live honest lives are saviors--they live that others\r\nmay live.\r\n\r\nHe that saveth his life shall lose it.\r\n\r\nWe grow through radiation, not by absorption or annexation. To him that\r\nhath shall be given. We keep things by giving them to others. The dead\r\ncarry in their clenched hands only that which they have given away; and\r\nthe living carry only the love in their hearts which they have bestowed\r\non others.\r\n\r\n\"I and my Father are one\"--the thought is old, but to prove it from the\r\nso-called material world through the study of biology has been the\r\nlife-work of Ernst Haeckel.\r\n\r\nUndaunted we press ever on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARL VON LINNÆUS]\r\n\r\nLINNÆUS\r\n\r\n\r\n     When a man of genius is in full swing, never contradict him, set\r\n     him straight or try to reason with him. Give him a free field. A\r\n     listener is sure to get a greater quantity of good, no matter how\r\n     mixed, than if the man is thwarted. Let Pegasus bolt--he will bring\r\n     you up in a place you know nothing about!\r\n\r\n     --_Linnæus_\r\n\r\n\r\nLINNÆUS\r\n\r\nOut of the mist and fog of time, the name of Aristotle looms up\r\nlarge. It was more than twenty-three hundred years ago that Aristotle\r\nlived. He might have lived yesterday, so distinctively modern was he in\r\nhis method and manner of thought. Aristotle was the world's first\r\nscientist. He sought to sift the false from the true--to arrange,\r\nclassify and systematize.\r\n\r\nAristotle instituted the first zoological garden that history mentions,\r\nbarring that of Noah. He formed the first herbarium, and made a\r\ngeological collection that prophesied for Hugh Miller the testimony of\r\nthe rocks. Very much of our scientific terminology goes back to\r\nAristotle.\r\n\r\nAristotle was born in the mountains of Macedonia. His father was a\r\ndoctor and belonged to the retinue of King Amyntas. The King had a son\r\nnamed Philip, who was about the same age as Aristotle.\r\n\r\nSome years later, Philip had a son named Alexander, who was somewhat\r\nunruly, and Philip sent a Macedonian cry over to Aristotle, and\r\nAristotle harkened to the call for help and went over and took charge of\r\nthe education of Alexander.\r\n\r\nThe science of medicine in Aristotle's boyhood was the science of\r\nsimples. In surgery the world has progressed, but in medicine, doctors\r\nhave progressed most, by consigning to the grave, that tells no tales,\r\nthe deadly materia medica.\r\n\r\nIn Aristotle's childhood, when his father was both guide and physician\r\nto the king, on hunting trips through the mountains, the doctor taught\r\nthe boys to recognize sarsaparilla, stramonium, hemlock, hellebore,\r\nsassafras and mandrake. Then Aristotle made a list of all the plants he\r\nknew and wrote down the supposed properties of each.\r\n\r\nBefore Aristotle was half-grown, both his father and mother died, and he\r\nwas cared for by a Mr. and Mrs. Proxenus. This worthy couple would never\r\nhave been known to the world were it not for the fact that they\r\nministered to this orphan boy. Long years afterward he wrote a poem to\r\ntheir memory, and paid them such a tender, human compliment that their\r\nnames have been woven into the very fabric of letters. \"They loved each\r\nother, and still had love enough left for me,\" he says. And we can only\r\nguess whether this man and his wife with hearts illumined by divine\r\npassion, the only thing that yet gladdens the world, ever imagined that\r\nthey were supplying an atmosphere in which would bud and blossom one of\r\nthe greatest intellects the world has ever known.\r\n\r\nIt was through the help of Proxenus that Aristotle was enabled to go to\r\nAthens and attend the School of Oratory, of which Plato was dean.\r\n\r\nThe fine, receptive spirit of this slender youth evidently brought out\r\nfrom Plato's heart the best that was packed away there.\r\n\r\nAristotle was soon the star scholar. To get much out of school you have\r\nto take much with you when you go there. In one particular, especially,\r\nAristotle, the country boy from Macedonia, brought much to Plato--and\r\nthis was the scientific spirit. Plato's bent was philosophy, poetry,\r\nrhetoric--he was an artist in expression.\r\n\r\n\"Know thyself,\" said Socrates, the teacher of Plato.\r\n\r\n\"Be thyself,\" said Plato. \"Know the world of Nature, of which you are a\r\npart,\" said Aristotle; \"and you will be yourself and know yourself\r\nwithout thought or effort. The things you see, you are.\"\r\n\r\nTwenty-three years Aristotle and Plato were together, and when they\r\nseparated it was on the relative value of science and poetry. \"Science\r\nis vital,\" said Aristotle; \"but poetry and rhetoric are incidental.\" It\r\nwas a little like the classic argument still carried on in all\r\npublishing-houses, as to which is the greater: the man who writes the\r\ntext or the man who illustrates it.\r\n\r\nOne is almost tempted to think that Plato's finest product was\r\nAristotle, just as Sir Humphry Davy's greatest discovery was Michael\r\nFaraday. One fine, earnest, receptive pupil is about all any teacher\r\nshould expect in a lifetime, but Plato had at least two, Aristotle and\r\nTheophrastus. And Theophrastus dated his birth from the day he met\r\nAristotle.\r\n\r\nTheo-Phrastus means God's speech, or one who speaks divinely. The boy's\r\nreal name was Ferguson. But the name given by Aristotle, who always had\r\na passion for naming things, stuck, and the world knows this superbly\r\ngreat man as Theophrastus.\r\n\r\nBotany dates from Theophrastus. And Theophrastus it was who wrote that\r\ngreatest of acknowledgments, when, in dedicating one of his books, he\r\nexpressed his indebtedness in these words: \"To Aristotle, the inspirer\r\nof all I am or hope to be.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter Theophrastus' death the science of botany slept for three hundred\r\nyears. During this interval was played in Palestine that immortal drama\r\nwhich so profoundly influenced the world. Twenty-three years after the\r\nbirth of Christ, Pliny, the Naturalist, was born.\r\n\r\nHe was the uncle of his nephew, and it is probable that the younger man\r\nwould have been swallowed in oblivion, just as the body of the older one\r\nwas covered by the eager ashes of Vesuvius, were it not for the fact\r\nthat Pliny the Elder had made the name deathless.\r\n\r\nPliny the Younger was about such a man as Richard Le Gallienne; Pliny\r\nthe Elder was like Thomas A. Edison.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-two, Pliny the Elder was a Captain in the Roman Army doing\r\nservice in Germany. Here he made memoranda of the trees, shrubs and\r\nflowers he saw, and compared them with similar objects he knew at home.\r\n\"Animal and vegetable life change as you go North and South; from this I\r\nassume that life is largely a matter of temperature and moisture.\" Thus\r\nwrote this barbaric Roman soldier, who thereby proved he was not so much\r\nof a barbarian after all. When he was twenty-five, his command was\r\ntransferred to Africa, and here, in the moments stolen from sleep, he\r\nwrote a work in three volumes on education, entitled, \"Studiosus.\"\r\n\r\nIn writing the book he got an education--to find out about a thing,\r\nwrite a book on it. Pliny returned to Rome and began the practise of\r\nlaw, and developed into a special pleader of marked power. He still held\r\nhis commission in the army, and was sent on various diplomatic errands\r\nto Spain, Africa, Germany, Gaul and Greece. If you want things done,\r\ncall on a busy man: the man of leisure has no spare time.\r\n\r\nPliny's jottings on natural history very soon resolved themselves into\r\nthe most ambitious plan, which up to that time had not been attempted by\r\nman--he would write out and sum up all human knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe next man to try the same thing was Alexander von Humboldt. We now\r\nhave Pliny's \"Natural History\" in thirty-seven volumes. His other forty\r\nvolumes are lost. The first volume of the \"Natural History,\" which was\r\nwritten last, gives a list of the authors consulted. Aristotle and\r\nTheophrastus take the places of honor, and then follow a score of names\r\nof men whose works have perished and whom we know mostly through what\r\nPliny says about them. So not only does Pliny write science as he saw\r\nit, but introduces us into a select circle of authors whom otherwise we\r\nwould not know. We have the world of Nature, but we would not have this\r\nworld of thinkers, were it not for Pliny.\r\n\r\nPliny even quotes Sappho, who loved and sung, and whose poems reached us\r\nonly through scattered quotations, as if Emerson's works should perish\r\nand we would revive him through a file of \"The Philistine\" magazine.\r\nPliny and Paul were contemporaries. Pliny lived at Rome when Paul lived\r\nthere in his own hired house, but Pliny never mentioned him, and\r\nprobably never heard of him.\r\n\r\nOne man was interested in this world, the other in the next.\r\n\r\nPliny begins his great work with a plagiarism on Lyman Abbott, \"There is\r\nbut one God.\" The idea that there were many arose out of the thought\r\nthat because there were many things, there must be special gods to look\r\nafter them: gods of the harvest, gods of the household, gods of the\r\nrain, etc.\r\n\r\nThere is but one God, says Pliny, and this God manifests Himself in\r\nNature. Nature and Nature's work are one. This world and all other\r\nworlds we see or can think of are parts of Nature. If there are other\r\nUniverses, they are natural; that is to say, a part of Nature. God rules\r\nthem all according to laws which He Himself can not violate. It is vain\r\nto supplicate Him, and absurd to worship Him, for to do these things is\r\nto degrade Him with the thought that He is like us. The assumption that\r\nGod is very much like us is not complimentary to God.\r\n\r\nGod can not do an unnatural or a supernatural thing. He can not kill\r\nHimself. He can not make the greater less than the less. He can not make\r\ntwice ten anything else than twenty.\r\n\r\nHe can not make a stick that has but one end. He can not make the past,\r\nfuture. He can not make one who has lived never to have lived. He can\r\nnot make the mortal, immortal; nor the immortal, mortal. He can change\r\nthe form of things, but He can not abolish a thing. Pliny preaches the\r\nUnity of the Universe and his religion is the religion of Humanity.\r\n\r\nPliny says:\r\n\r\n\"We can not injure God, but we can injure man. And as man is part of\r\nNature or God, the only way to serve God is to benefit man. If we love\r\nGod, the way to reveal that love is in our conduct toward our fellows.\"\r\n\r\nPliny was close upon the Law of the Correlation of Forces, and he almost\r\ngot a glimpse of the Law of Attraction or Gravitation. He sensed these\r\nthings, but could not prove them. Pliny touched life at an immense\r\nnumber of points. What he saw, he knew, but when he took things on the\r\nword of Marco Polo and Sir John Mandeville (for these gentlemen\r\nadventurers have always lived), he fell into curious errors. For\r\ninstance, he tells of horses in Africa that have wings, and when hard\r\npressed, fly like birds; of ostriches that give milk, and of elephants\r\nthat live on land or sea equally well; of mines where gold is found in\r\nsolid masses and the natives dig into it for diamonds.\r\n\r\nBut outside of these little lapses, Pliny writes sanely and well. Book\r\nTwo treats of the crust of the earth, of earthquakes, meteors, volcanoes\r\n(these had a strange fascination for him), islands and upheavals.\r\n\r\nBooks Three and Four relate of geography and give amusing information\r\nabout the shape of the continents and the form of the earth. Then comes\r\na book on man, his evolution and physical qualities, with a history of\r\nthe races.\r\n\r\nNext is a book on Zoology, with a resume of all that was written by\r\nAristotle, and with many corroborations of Thompson-Seton and Rudyard\r\nKipling. Facts from the \"Jungle Book\" are here recited at length. Book\r\nNine is on marine life--sponges, shells and coral insects. Book Ten\r\ntreats of birds, and carries the subject further than it had ever been\r\ntaken before, even if it does at times contradict John Burroughs. Book\r\nEleven is on insects, bugs and beetles, and tells, among other things,\r\nof bats that make fires in caves to keep themselves warm. Book Twelve is\r\non trees, their varieties, height, age, growth, qualities and\r\ndistribution. Book Thirteen treats of fruits, juices, gums, wax, saps\r\nand perfumes. Book Fourteen is on grapes and the making of wine, with a\r\ndescription of the process and the various kinds of wine, their effects\r\non the human system, with a goodly temperance lesson backed up by\r\nincidents and examples.\r\n\r\nBook Fifteen treats of pomegranates, apples, plums, peaches, figs and\r\nvarious other luscious fruits, and shows much intimate and valuable\r\nknowledge. And so the list runs down through, treating at great length\r\nof bees, fishes, woods, iron, lead, copper, gold, marble, fluids, gases,\r\nrivers, swamps, seas, and a thousand and one things that were familiar\r\nto this marvelous man. But of all subjects, Pliny shows a much greater\r\nlove for botany than for anything else. Plants, flowers, vines, trees\r\nand mosses interest him always, and he breaks off other subjects to tell\r\nof some flower that he has just discovered.\r\n\r\nPliny had command of the Roman fleet that was anchored in the bay off\r\nPompeii, when that city was destroyed in the year Seventy-nine.\r\nBulwer-Lytton tells the story, with probably a close regard for the\r\nfacts. The sailors, obeying Pliny's orders, did their utmost to save\r\nhuman life, and rescued hundreds. Pliny himself made various trips in a\r\nsmall boat from the ship to the beach. He was safely on board the\r\nflag-ship, and orders had been given to weigh anchor, when the commander\r\ndecided to make one more visit to the perishing city to see if he could\r\nnot rescue a few more, and also to get a closer view of Nature in a\r\ntantrum.\r\n\r\nHe rowed away into the fog. The sailors waited for their beloved\r\ncommander, but waited in vain. He had ventured too close to the flowing\r\nlava, and was suffocated by the fumes, a victim to his love for humanity\r\nand his desire for knowledge. So died Pliny the Elder, aged but\r\nfifty-six years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll children are zoologists, but a botanist appears upon the earth only\r\nat rare intervals.\r\n\r\nA Botanist is born--not made. From the time of Pliny, botany performed\r\nthe Rip Van Winkle act until John Ray, the son of a blacksmith, appeared\r\nupon the scene in England. In the meantime, Leonardo had classified the\r\nrocks, recorded the birds, counted the animals and written a book of\r\nthree thousand pages on the horse. Leonardo dissected many plants, but\r\nlater fell back upon the rose for decorative purposes.\r\n\r\nJohn Ray was born in Sixteen Hundred Twenty-eight near Braintree in\r\nEssex. Now, as to genius--no blacksmith-shop is safe from it. We know\r\nwhere to find ginseng, but genius is the secret of God.\r\n\r\nA blacksmith's helper by day, this aproned lad with sooty face dreamed\r\ndreams. Evenings he studied Greek with the village parson. They read\r\nAristotle and Theophrastus.\r\n\r\nHave a care there, you Macedonian miscreant, dead two thousand years,\r\nyou are turning this boy's head!\r\n\r\nJohn Ray would be a botanist as great as Aristotle, and he would speak\r\ndivinely, just as did Theophrastus. It is all a matter of desire! Young\r\nRay became a Minor Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge; then a Major\r\nFellow; then he took the Master's degree; next he became lecturer on\r\nGreek; and insisted that Aristotle was the greatest man the world had\r\never seen, except none, and the Dean raised an eyebrow.\r\n\r\nThe professor of mathematics resigned and Ray took his place; next he\r\nbecame Junior Dean, and then College Steward; and according to the\r\ncustom of the times he used to preach in the chapel. One of his sermons\r\nwas from the text, \"Consider the lilies of the field.\" Another sermon\r\nthat brought him more notoriety than fame was on the subject, \"God in\r\nCreation,\" wherein he argued that to find God we should look for Him\r\nmore in the world of Nature and not so much in books.\r\n\r\nMatters were getting strained. Ray was asked to subscribe to the Act of\r\nUniformity, which was a promise that he would never preach anything that\r\nwas not prescribed by the Church. Ray demurred, and begged that he be\r\nallowed to go free and preach anything he thought was truth--new truth\r\nmight come to him! This shows the absurdity of Ray. He was asked to\r\nreconsider or resign. He resigned--resigned the year that Sir Isaac\r\nNewton entered.\r\n\r\nFortunately, one particular pupil followed him, not that he\r\nloved college less, but that he loved Ray more. This pupil was\r\nFrancis Willughby. Through the bounty of this pupil we get the\r\nscientist--otherwise, Ray would surely have been starved into\r\nsubjection. Willughby took Ray to the home of his parents, who were rich\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nRay undertook the education of young Willughby, very much as Aristotle\r\ntook charge of Alexander. Willughby and Ray traveled, studied, observed\r\nand wrote. They went to Spain, took trips to France, Italy and\r\nSwitzerland, and journeyed to Scotland. Willughby devoted his life to\r\nOrnithology and Ichthyology and won a deathless place in science.\r\n\r\nRay specialized on botany, and did a work in classification never done\r\nbefore. He made a catalog of the flora of England that wrung even from\r\nCambridge a compliment--they offered him the degree of LL.D. Ray quietly\r\ndeclined it, saying he was only a simple countryman, and honors or\r\ntitles would be a disadvantage, tending to separate him from the plain\r\npeople with whom he worked. However, the Royal Society elected him a\r\nmember, and he accepted the honor, that he might put the results of his\r\nwork on record. His paper on the circulation of sap in trees was read\r\nbefore the Royal Society, on the request of Newton. Due credit was given\r\nHarvey for his discovery of the circulation of the blood; but Ray made\r\nthe fine point that man was brother to the tree, and his life was\r\nderived from the same Source.\r\n\r\nWhen Willughby died, in Sixteen Hundred Seventy-two, he left Ray a\r\nyearly income of three hundred dollars. Doctor Johnson told Boswell that\r\nRay had a collection of twenty thousand English bugs. Our botanical\r\nterminology comes more from John Ray than from any other man. Ray\r\nadopted wherever possible the names given by Aristotle, so loyal, loving\r\nand true was he to the Master. Ray died in Seventeen Hundred Five, aged\r\nseventy-six.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo years after the death of John Ray, in Seventeen Hundred Seven, was\r\nborn a baby who was destined to find biology a chaos, and leave it a\r\ncosmos.\r\n\r\nLinnæus did for botany what Galileo had done for astronomy. John Ray was\r\nonly a John the Baptist.\r\n\r\nCarl von Linne, or Carolus Linnæus as he preferred to be called, was\r\nborn in an obscure village in the Province of Smaland, Sweden. His\r\nfather was a clergyman, passing rich on forty pounds a year. His mother\r\nwas only eighteen years old when she bore him, and his father had just\r\nturned twenty-one. It was a poor parish, and one of the deacons\r\nexplained that they could not afford a real preacher; so they hired a\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nCarl tells in his journal, of remembering how, when he was but four\r\nyears old, his father would lead his congregation out through the woods\r\nand, all seated on the grass, the father would tell the people about the\r\nplants and herbs and how to distinguish them.\r\n\r\nBack of the parsonage there was a goodly garden, where the young pastor\r\nand his wife worked many happy hours. When Carl was eight years of age,\r\na corner of this garden was set apart for his very own.\r\n\r\nHe pressed into his service several children of the neighborhood, and\r\nthey carried flat stones from the near-by brook to wall in this\r\nminiature farm--this botanical garden.\r\n\r\nThe child that hasn't a flowerbed or a garden of its ownest own is\r\nbeing cheated out of its birthright.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the child mirrors the evolution of the race. And as the\r\nrace has passed through the savage, pastoral and agricultural stages, so\r\nshould the child. As a people we are now in the commercial or\r\ncompetitive stage, but we are slowly emerging out of this into the age\r\nof co-operation or enlightened self-interest.\r\n\r\nIt is only a very great man--one with a prophetic vision--who can see\r\nbeyond the stage in which he is.\r\n\r\nThe stage we are in seems the best and the final one--otherwise, we\r\nwould not be in it. But to skip any of these stages in the education or\r\nevolution of the individual seems a sore mistake. Children hedged and\r\nprotected from digging in the dirt develop into \"third rounders,\" as our\r\ntheosophic friends would say, that is, educated non-comps--vast top-head\r\nand small cerebellum--people who can explain the unknowable, but who do\r\nnot pay cash. Third rounders all--fit only for the melting-pot!\r\n\r\nA tramp is one who has fallen a victim of arrested development and never\r\nemerged from the nomadic stage; an artistic dilettante is one who has\r\njumped the round where boys dig in the dirt and has evolved into a\r\nmissnancy.\r\n\r\nYoung Carl Linnæus skipped no round in his evolution. He began as a\r\nsavage, robbing birds' nests, chasing butterflies, capturing bees, bugs\r\nand beetles. He trained goats to drive, hitched up a calf, fenced his\r\nlittle farm, and planted it with strange and curious crops.\r\n\r\nClergymen once were the only schoolteachers, and in Sweden, when Linnæus\r\nwas a boy, there was a plan of farming children out among preachers that\r\nthey might be educated. Possibly this plan of having some one besides\r\nthe parents teach the lessons is good--I can not say. But young Carl did\r\nnot succeed--save in disturbing the peace among the households of the\r\nhalf-dozen clergymen who in turn had him.\r\n\r\nThe boy evidently was a handsome fellow, a typical Swede, with hair as\r\nfair as the sunshine, blue eyes, and a pink face that set off the fair\r\nhair and made him look like a Circassian.\r\n\r\nHe had energy plus, and the way he cluttered up the parsonages where he\r\nlodged was a distraction to good housewives: birds' nests, feathers,\r\nskins, claws, fungi, leaves, flowers, roots, stalks, rocks, sticks and\r\nstones--and when one meddled with his treasures, there was trouble. And\r\nthere was always trouble; for the boy possessed a temper, and usually\r\nhad it right with him.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the parents was that Carl should become a clergyman, but\r\nhis distaste for theology did not go unexpressed. So perverse and\r\npersistent were his inclinations that they preyed on the mind of his\r\nfather, who quoted King Lear and said, \"How sharper than a serpent's\r\ntooth it is to have a thankless child!\"\r\n\r\nHis troubles weighed so upon the good clergyman that his nerves became\r\naffected and he went to the neighboring town of Wexio to consult Doctor\r\nRothman, a famed medical expert.\r\n\r\nThe good clergyman, in the course of his conversation with the doctor,\r\ntold of his mortification on account of the dulness and perversity of\r\nhis son.\r\n\r\nDoctor Rothman listened in patience and came to the conclusion that\r\nyoung Mr. Linnæus was a good boy who did the wrong thing. All energy is\r\nGod's, but it may be misdirected. A boy not good enough for a preacher\r\nmight make a good doctor--an excess of virtue is not required in the\r\nrecipe for a physician.\r\n\r\n\"I'll cure you, by taking charge of your boy,\" said Rothman; \"you want\r\nto make a clergyman of the youth: I'll let him be just what he wants to\r\nbe, a naturalist and a physician.\" And it was so.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe year spent by Linnæus under the roof of Doctor Rothman was a pivotal\r\npoint in his life. He was eighteen years old. The contempt of Rothman\r\nfor the refinements of education appealed to the young man. Rothman was\r\nblunt, direct, and to the point: he had a theory that people grew by\r\ndoing what they wanted to do, not by resisting their impulses.\r\n\r\nHe was both friend and comrade to the boy. They rode together, dissected\r\nanimals and plants, and the young man assisted in operations. Linnæus\r\nhad the run of the Doctor's library, and without knowing it, was\r\nmastering physiology.\r\n\r\n\"I would adopt him as my son,\" said Rothman; \"but I love him so much\r\nthat I am going to separate him from me. My roots have struck deep in\r\nthe soil: I am like the human trees told of by Dante; but the boy can go\r\non!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so Rothman sent him along to the University of Lund, with letters to\r\nanother doctor still more cranky than himself. This man was Doctor\r\nKilian Stobæus, a medical professor, physician to the king, and a\r\nnaturalist of note. Stobæus had a mixed-up museum of minerals, birds,\r\nfishes and plants.\r\n\r\nEverybody for a hundred miles who had a curious thing in the way of\r\nnatural history sent it to Stobæus. Into this medley of strange and\r\ncurious things Linnæus was plunged with orders to \"straighten it up.\"\r\nThere was a German student also living with the doctor, working for his\r\nboard. Linnæus took the lead and soon had the young German helping him\r\ncatalog the curios.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Ray had gotten abroad in Germany, and Ray's books had been\r\ntranslated and were being used in many of the German schools. Linnæus\r\nmade a bargain with the German student that they should speak only\r\nGerman--he wanted to find what was locked up in those German books on\r\nbotany.\r\n\r\nStobæus was lame and had but one eye, so he used to call on the boys to\r\nhelp him, not only to hitch up his horse, but to write his\r\nprescriptions. Linnæus wrote very badly, and was chided because he did\r\nnot improve his penmanship, for it seems that in the olden times\r\nphysicians wrote legibly. Linnæus resented the rebuke, and was shown the\r\ndoor. He was gone a week, when Stobæus sent for him, much to his relief.\r\nThis little comedy was played several times during the year, through\r\nwhat Linnæus afterward acknowledged as his fault. One would hardly think\r\nthat the man who on first seeing the English gorse in full bloom fell on\r\nhis knees, burst into tears of joy, and thanked God that he had lived to\r\nsee this day, would have had a fiery temper. Then further, the gentle,\r\nspiritual qualities that Linnæus in his later life developed give one\r\nthe idea that he was always of a gentle nature.\r\n\r\nIn indexing the museum of Doctor Stobæus, Linnæus found his bent. \"I\r\nwill never be a doctor,\" he said; \"but I can beat the world on making a\r\ncatalog.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus it was: his genius lay in classification. \"He indexed and\r\ncatalogued the world,\" a great writer has said.\r\n\r\nAfter a year at the University of Lund, with more learned by working for\r\nhis board than at school, there was a visit from Doctor Rothman, who had\r\njust dropped in to see his old friend Stobæus. The fact was, Rothman\r\ncared a deal more for Linnæus than he did for Stobæus. \"Weeds develop\r\ninto flowers by transplanting only,\" said Rothman to Linnæus. \"You need\r\na different soil--get out of here before you get pot-bound.\"\r\n\r\n\"But about Cyclops?\" asked Linnæus.\r\n\r\n\"Let Cyclops go to the devil!\" It was no use to ask permission of\r\nStobæus. Linnæus was so valuable that Stobæus would not spare him.\r\n\r\nSo Linnæus packed up and departed between the dawn and the day, leaving\r\na letter stating he had gone to Upsala because it seemed best and\r\nbegging forgiveness for such seeming ingratitude.\r\n\r\nWhen Linnæus got to Upsala he found a letter from Doctor Cyclops,\r\nwritten in wrath, requesting him never again to show his face in Lund.\r\nRothman also lost the friendship of Stobæus for his share in the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Linnæus arrived at Upsala he had one marked distinction, according\r\nto his own account--he was the poorest student that had ever knocked at\r\nthe gates of the University for admittance. Perhaps this is a mistake,\r\nfor even though the young man had patched his shoes with birch bark, he\r\nwas not in debt.\r\n\r\nAnd the youth of twenty-one who has health, hope, ambition and animation\r\nis not to be pitied. Poverty is only for the people who think poverty.\r\n\r\nIt is five hundred English miles from Lund to Upsala. After his long,\r\nweary tramp, Linnæus sat on the edge of the hill and looked down at the\r\nscattered town of Upsala in the valley below. A stranger passing by\r\npointed out the college buildings, where a thousand young men were being\r\ndrilled and disciplined in the mysteries of learning. \"Where is the\r\nBotanical Garden?\" asked the newcomer.\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out to him. He gazed on the site, carefully studied the\r\nsurrounding landscape, and mentally calculated where he would move the\r\nBotanical Garden as soon as he had control of it. Let us anticipate here\r\njust long enough to explain that the Upsala Botanical Garden now is\r\nwhere Linnæus said it should be. It is a most beautiful place, lined off\r\nwith close-growing shrubbery. After traversing the winding paths, one\r\nreaches the lecture-hall, built after the Greek, with porches, peristyle\r\nand gently ascending marble steps. On entering the building, the first\r\nobject that attracts the visitor is the life-size statue of Linnæus.\r\n\r\nTo the left, a half-mile away, is the old cathedral--a place that never\r\nmuch interested Linnæus. But there now rests his dust, and in windows\r\nand also in storied bronze his face, form and fame endure. In the\r\nmeantime, we have left the young man sitting on a boulder looking down\r\nat the town ere he goes forward to possess it.\r\n\r\nHe adjusts his shoes with their gaping wounds, shakes the dust from his\r\ncap, and then takes from his pack a faded neckscarf, puts it on and he\r\nis ready.\r\n\r\nDescending the hill he forgets his lameness, waives the stone-bruises,\r\nand walks confidently to the Botanical Garden, which he views with a\r\ncritical eye. Next, he inquires for the General Superintendent who lives\r\nnear. The young man presents his credentials from Rothman, who describes\r\nthe youth as one who knows and loves the flowers, and who can be useful\r\nin office or garden and is not above spade and hoe. The Superintendent\r\nlooks at the pink face, touched with bronze from days in the open air,\r\nnotes the long yellow hair, beholds the out-of-door look of fortitude\r\nthat comes from hard and plain fare, and inwardly compares these things\r\nwith the lack of them in some of his students. \"But this Doctor--Doctor\r\nRothman who wrote this letter--I do not have the honor of knowing him,\"\r\nsays the Superintendent.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you are unfortunate,\" replies the youth; \"he is a very great man,\r\nand I myself will vouch for him in every way.\"\r\n\r\nOh! this glowing confidence of youth--before there comes a surplus of\r\nlime in the bones, or the touch of winter in the heart! The\r\nSuperintendent smiled. Knock in faith and the door shall be\r\nopened--there are those whom no one can turn away. A stray bed was found\r\nin the garret for the stranger, and the next morning he was earnestly at\r\nwork cataloguing the dried plants in the herbarium, a task long delayed\r\nbecause there was no one to do it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe study of Natural History in the University of Upsala was, at this\r\ntime, at a low ebb. It was like the Art Department in many of the\r\nAmerican colleges: its existence largely confined to the school catalog.\r\nThere were many weeks of biting poverty and neglect for Linnæus, but he\r\nworked away in obscurity and silence and endured, saying all the time,\r\n\"The sun will come out, the sun will come out!\" Doctor Olaf Rudbeck had\r\ncharge of the chair of Botany, but seldom sat in it. His business was\r\nmedicine. He gave no lectures, but the report was that he made his\r\nstudents toil at cultivating in his garden--this to open up their\r\nintellectual pores. In the course of his work, Linnæus devised a sex\r\nplan of classification, instead of the so-called natural method. He\r\nwrote out his ideas and submitted them to Rudbeck.\r\n\r\nThe learned Doctor first pooh-poohed the plan, then tolerated it, and in\r\na month claimed he had himself devised it. On the scheme being explained\r\nto others there was opposition, and Rudbeck requested Linnæus to amplify\r\nhis notes into a thesis, and read it as a lecture. This was done, and so\r\npleased was the old man that he appointed Linnæus his adjunctus. In the\r\nSpring of Seventeen Hundred Thirty, Linnæus began to give weekly\r\nlectures on some topic of Natural History.\r\n\r\nLinnæus was now fairly launched. His animation, clear thinking, handsome\r\nface and graceful ways made his lectures very popular. Science in his\r\nhands was no longer the dull and turgid thing it had before been in the\r\nUniversity. He would give a lecture in the hall, and then invite the\r\naudience to walk with him in the woods. He seemed to know everything:\r\nbirds, beetles, bugs, beasts, trees, weeds, flowers, rocks and stones\r\nwere to him familiar.\r\n\r\nHe showed his pupils things they had walked on all their lives and never\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe old Botanical Garden that had degenerated into a kitchen-garden for\r\nthe Commons was rearranged and furnished with many specimens gathered\r\nround about.\r\n\r\nA system of exchange was carried on with other schools, and Natural\r\nHistory at Upsala was fast becoming a feature. Old Doctor Rudbeck\r\nhobbled around with the classes, and when Linnæus lectured sat in a\r\nfront seat, applauding by rapping his cane on the floor and ejaculating\r\nwords of encouragement.\r\n\r\nLinnæus was now receiving invitations to lecture at other schools in the\r\nvicinity. He made excursions and reports on the Natural History of the\r\ncountry around. The Academy of Science of Upsala now selected him to go\r\nto Lapland and explore the resources of that country, which was then\r\nlittle known.\r\n\r\nThe journey was to be a long and dangerous one. It meant four thousand\r\nmiles of travel on foot, by sledge and on horseback, over a country that\r\nwas for the most part mountainous, without roads, and peopled with\r\nsemi-savages.\r\n\r\nThere were two reasons why Linnæus should make the trip:\r\n\r\nOne was he had the hardihood and the fortitude to do it.\r\n\r\nAnd second, he was not wanted at Upsala. He was becoming too popular.\r\nOne rival professor had gone so far as to prefer formal charges of\r\nscientific heresy; he also made the telling point that Linnæus was not a\r\ncollege graduate. The rule of the University was that no lecturer,\r\nteacher or professor should be employed who did not have a degree from\r\nsome foreign University.\r\n\r\nInquiry was made and it was found that Linnæus had left the University\r\nof Lund under a cloud. Linnæus was confronted with the charge, and\r\ndeclined to answer it, thus practically pleading guilty. So, to get him\r\nout of Upsala seemed a desirable thing, both to friends and to foes. His\r\nfriends secured the commission for the Lapland exploration, and his\r\nenemies made no objections, merely whispering, \"Good riddance!\" To be\r\ntwenty-four, in good health, with hair like that of General Custer, a\r\nheart to appreciate Nature, a good horse under you, and a commission\r\nfrom the State to do an important work, in your left-hand\r\nbreast-pocket--what Heaven more complete!\r\n\r\nA reception was tendered the young naturalist in the great hall, and he\r\naddressed the students on the necessity of doing your work as well as\r\nyou can, and being kind. Before beginning his arduous and dangerous\r\njourney, Linnæus went to Lund to visit his old patron, Doctor Stobæus.\r\nTime, the great healer, had cured the Doctor of his hate, and he now\r\nspoke of Linnæus as his best pupil. He had left hastily by the wan light\r\nof the moon, without leaving orders where his mail was to be forwarded;\r\nbut now he was received as an honored guest. All the little\r\nmisunderstandings they had were laughed over as jokes.\r\n\r\nFrom Lund, Linnæus went to his home in Smaland to visit his parents.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that they were very proud of him, and the\r\nvillagers turned out in great numbers to do him honor, perhaps, in their\r\nsimplicity, not knowing why.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe account of the Lapland trip by Linnæus is to be found in his book,\r\n\"Lachesis Lapponica.\"\r\n\r\nThe journey covered over four thousand miles and took from May to\r\nNovember, Seventeen Hundred Thirty-one. The volume is in the form of a\r\ndaily journal, and is as interesting as \"Robinson Crusoe.\" There is no\r\nnight there in Summer; but for all this, Lapland is not a paradise.\r\n\r\nIt is a great stretch of desert, vast steppes and lofty mountains, with\r\nhere and there fertile valleys. To be out in the wide open, with no\r\ncompanions but a horse and a dog, filled Linnæus' heart with a wild joy.\r\nAs he went on, the road grew so rough that he had to part with the\r\nhorse, which he did with a pang, but the dog kept him company.\r\n\r\nTo be educated is to liberate the mind from its trammels and fears--to\r\nset it free, new-chiseled from the rock. Linnæus reveled in the vast\r\nloneliness of the steppes and took a hearty satisfaction in the hard\r\nfare. His gun and fishing-rod stood him in good stead; there were\r\nberries at times, and edible barks and watercress, and when these failed\r\nhe had a little bag of meal and dried reindeer-tongues to fall back\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of his living is shown best in the fact that the expenses\r\nfor the entire journey, occupying seven months, were only twenty-five\r\npounds, or less than one hundred twenty-five dollars. The Academy had\r\nset aside sixty pounds, and their surprise at having most of the money\r\nreturned to them, instead of a demand being made for more, won them,\r\nhand and heart. He had hit the sturdy old burghers in a sensitive\r\nspot--the pocketbook--and they passed resolutions declaring him the\r\nworld's greatest naturalist, and voted him a medal, to be cast at his\r\nown expense. Fame is delightful, but as collateral it does not rank\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nLinnæus was without funds and without occupation. He gave a course of\r\nlectures at the University on his explorations, where every seat was\r\ntaken, and even the stage and windows were filled. The sprightliness,\r\ngrace and intellect Linnæus brought to bear illumined his theme.\r\n\r\nWhen Linnæus lectured, all classes were dismissed: none could rival him.\r\nHis very excellence was his disadvantage. Jealousy was hot on his trail,\r\nfor he was disturbing the balance of stupidity. A movement grew to force\r\nhim from the college. Formal charges were made, and when the case came\r\nto a trial the even tenor of justice was disturbed by Linnæus making an\r\nattack on Professor Rosen, his principal enemy, with intent to kill him.\r\nDueling has been forbidden in all the universities of Sweden since the\r\nyear Sixteen Hundred Eighty-two, and the diversion replaced by quartet\r\nsinging. So when Linnæus challenged his enemy to fight, and warned him\r\nhe would kill him if he didn't fight, and also if he did, things were in\r\na bad way for Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe former charges were dropped to take up the more serious--just as\r\nwhen a man is believed to be guilty of murder, no mention is made of his\r\ncrime of larceny.\r\n\r\nPoor Linnæus was under the ban. The enemy had won: Linnæus must leave.\r\nBut where should he go--what could he do? No college would receive him\r\nafter his being compelled to leave Upsala for riot. He decided that if\r\ndisgrace were to be his on account of revenge, he would accept the\r\ndisgrace. He would kill Rosen on sight and then either commit suicide or\r\naccept the consequences: it was all one! And so, laying plans to waylay\r\nhis victim, he fell asleep and dreamed he had done the deed.\r\n\r\nHe awoke in a sweat of horror!\r\n\r\nHe heard the officers at the door! He staggered to his feet, and was\r\nmaking wild plans to fight the pursuers, when it occurred to him that he\r\nhad only dreamed. He sat down, faint, but mightily relieved.\r\n\r\nThen he laughed, and it came to him that opposition was a part of the\r\ngreat game of life. To do a thing was to jostle others, and to jostle\r\nand be jostled was the fate of every man of power. \"He that endureth\r\nunto the end shall be saved.\"\r\n\r\nThe world was before him--the flowers still bloomed, and plants nodded\r\ntheir heads in the meadows; the summer winds blew across the fields of\r\nwheat, the branches waved. He was strong--he could plant and plow, or\r\ndig ditches, or hew lumber!\r\n\r\nSome one was hammering on the door; they had been knocking for fully\r\nfive minutes--ah! There had been no murder, so surely it was not the\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nHe arose slowly and opened the door, murmuring apologies. A letter for\r\nCarolus Linnæus! The letter was from Baron Reuterholm of Dalecarlia. It\r\ncontained a draft for twenty-five pounds, \"as a token of good faith,\"\r\nand begged that Linnæus would accept charge of an expedition to survey\r\nthe natural resources of Dalecarlia in the same way that he had Lapland,\r\nonly with greater minuteness. Linnæus read the letter again. The draft\r\nfluttered from his fingers to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Pick that up!\" he peremptorily ordered of the messenger. He wanted to\r\nsee if the other man saw it too.\r\n\r\nThe other man did pick it up! Linnæus was not dreaming, then, after\r\nall!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis second expedition had two objects: one was the better education of\r\nBaron Reuterholm's two sons, and the other the survey. One of these sons\r\nwas at the University of Upsala, and he had conceived such an admiration\r\nfor Linnæus that he had written home about him. No man knows what he is\r\ndoing: we succeed by the right oblique. Little did Linnæus guess that he\r\nwas preparing the way for great good fortune. The second excursion was\r\none of luxury. It lacked all the hardships of the first, and involved\r\nthe management of a party. Reuterholm was a rich Jewish banker, and a\r\nman in close touch with all Swedish affairs of State. This time Linnæus\r\nwas provided with ample funds.\r\n\r\nLinnæus had a genius for system--a head for business. He classified men,\r\nand systematized his work like a general in the field. There were seven\r\nyoung naturalists in the party, and to each Linnæus assigned a special\r\nwork, with orders to hand in a written report of progress each evening.\r\nThat the \"Economist\" or steward of the party was an American lends an\r\nespecial note of interest for us. After Dalecarlia it was to be America!\r\n\r\nIn money matters he was punctilious and accurate, the result of his\r\nearly training in making both ends meet. The habits of thrift, industry,\r\nenergy and absolute honesty had made him a marked man--there is not so\r\nmuch competition along these lines.\r\n\r\nThe maps, measurements, drawings, and the exact, short, sharp, military\r\nreports turned in at regular intervals to the Baron won that worthy\r\nabsolutely.\r\n\r\nLinnæus was a businessman as well as a naturalist. It would require a\r\nbook to tell of the glorious half-gypsy life of these eight young men,\r\nmoving slowly through woods, across plains, over mountains and meadows,\r\nstudying soil, rocks, birds, trees and flowers, collecting and making\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nCamping at night by flowing streams, awakening with the dawn and cooking\r\nbreakfast by the campfire in a silence that took up their shouts of\r\nlaughter in surprise, and echoed them back from the neighboring hills!\r\nAt last the journey was ended. Linnæus had proved his ability to\r\nteach--his animation, good-cheer and friendly qualities brought his\r\npupils very close to him. Reuterholm insisted that he should attach\r\nhimself to the rising little college at Fahlun. There he met Doctor\r\nMoræus, a man of much worth in a scientific way. At his house Linnæus\r\nmade his home. There was a daughter in the household, Sara Elizabeth,\r\ntall, slender, appreciative and studious. One of the Reuterholms had\r\ncourted her, but in vain.\r\n\r\nThere were the usual results, and when Carolus and Sara Elizabeth came\r\nto Doctor Moræus hand in hand for his blessing, he granted it as good\r\nmen always do. Then the Doctor gave Linnæus some good advice--go to\r\nHolland or somewhere and get a doctor's degree. The enemies at Upsala\r\ncalled Linnæus \"the gypsy scientist.\" Silence them--Linnæus was now a\r\ngreat man, and the world would yet acknowledge it. Sara Elizabeth agreed\r\nin all of the propositions.\r\n\r\nLove, they say, is blind, but sometimes love is a regular telescope.\r\nThis time love saw things that the learned men of Upsala failed to\r\ndiscover--their diagnosis was wrong. Linnæus had prepared a thesis on\r\nintermittent fever, and he was assured that if he presented this thesis\r\nat the medical school at Harderwijk, Holland, with letters from Baron\r\nReuterholm and Doctor Moræus, it would secure him the much desired M.D.\r\n\r\nA few months, at most, would suffice. He could then return to Fahlun and\r\ntake his place as a practising physician and a professor in the college,\r\nmarry the lady of his choice and live happy ever afterward.\r\n\r\nSo he started away southward. In due time, he arrived at Harderwijk and\r\nread his thesis to the faculty. Instead of the callow youth, such as\r\nthey usually dealt with, they found a practised speaker who defended his\r\npoints with grace and confidence. The degree was at once voted, and a\r\n\"cum laude\" thrown in for good measure. Linnæus was asked to remain\r\nthere and give a course of lectures on natural history. This he did.\r\nBefore going home he thought he would take a little look in on Leyden,\r\nat that time the bookmaking and literary center of the world. At Leyden\r\nhe met Gronovius, the naturalist, who asked him to remain and give\r\nlectures at the University. He did so, and incidentally showed\r\nGronovius the manuscript of his book on the new system of botanic\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nGronovius was so delighted that he insisted on having the book printed\r\nby the Plantins at his own expense. Here was a piece of good fortune\r\nLinnæus had not anticipated.\r\n\r\nLinnæus now settled down to read the proofs and help the work through\r\nthe presses. But he never idled an hour.\r\n\r\nHe studied, wrote and lectured, and made little excursions with his\r\nfriends through the fields. The book finished, he hastened to send\r\ncopies back to Fahlun to Sara Elizabeth, saying he must see Amsterdam\r\nand then go to Antwerp to visit his new-found printer-friends there, and\r\nthen go home!\r\n\r\nAt Amsterdam he remained a whole year, living at the house of Burman,\r\nthe naturalist.\r\n\r\nThe wealthy banker, Cliffort, first among amateur botanists of his day,\r\ninvited Linnæus to visit him at his country-house at Hartecamp. Here he\r\nsaw the finest garden he had ever looked upon. Cliffort had copies of\r\nLinnæus' book and he now insisted that the author should remain, catalog\r\nhis collection and issue the book with the help of the Plantins, all\r\nwithout regard to cost. It took a year to get the work out, but it yet\r\nremains one of the finest things ever attempted in a bookmaking way on\r\nthe subject of botany.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, with the help of Cliffort, Linnæus published\r\nanother big book of his own called, \"Fundamenta Botanica.\" This book\r\nwas taken up at Oxford and used as a textbook, in preference to Ray.\r\n\r\nLinnæus received invitations from England and was persuaded to take a\r\ntrip across to that country. He visited Oxford and London, and was\r\nreceived by scientific men as a conquering hero. He saw Garrick act and\r\nheard George Frederick Handel, where the crowd was so great that a\r\nnotice was posted requesting gentlemen to come without swords and ladies\r\nwithout hoops. Handel composed an aria in his honor.\r\n\r\nReturning to Leyden, Linnæus was urged by the municipality to remain and\r\nrearrange the public flower-gardens and catalog the rare plants at the\r\nUniversity. This took a year, in which three more books were issued\r\nunder his skilful care.\r\n\r\nHe now started for home in earnest, by way of Paris, with what a\r\ncontemporary calls \"a trunkful of medals.\"\r\n\r\nParis, too, had honors and employment for the great botanist, but he\r\nescaped and at last reached Fahlun. He had been gone nearly four years,\r\nand during the interval had established his place in the scientific\r\nworld as the first botanist of the time.\r\n\r\n\"It was love that sent me out of Sweden, and but for love I would never\r\nhave returned,\" he wrote.\r\n\r\nLinnæus and Sara Elizabeth were married June Twenty-six, Seventeen\r\nHundred Thirty-nine.\r\n\r\nNow the unexpected happened: Upsala petitioned Linnæus to return, and\r\nthe man who headed the petition was the one who had driven him away and\r\nwho came near being killed for his pains. Linnæus and his wife went to\r\nUpsala, rich, honored, beloved.\r\n\r\nLinnæus shifted the scientific center of gravity of all Europe to a\r\ntown, practically to them obscure, a thing they themselves scarcely\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, the life of Linnæus flowed forward like a great and mighty\r\nriver--everything made way for him. He was invited by the King of Spain\r\nto come to that country and found a School of Science, and so lavish\r\nwere the promises that they surely would have turned the head of a\r\nlesser man. Universities in many civilized countries honored themselves\r\nby giving him degrees.\r\n\r\nIn Seventeen Hundred Sixty-one, the King of Sweden issued a patent of\r\nnobility in his honor, and thereafter he was Carl von Linne. In England\r\nhe was known as Sir Charles Linn.\r\n\r\nSainte-Beuve, the eminent French critic, says that the world has\r\nproduced only about half a dozen men who deserve to be placed in the\r\nfirst class. The elements that make up this super-superior man are high\r\nintellect, which abandons itself to the purpose in hand, careless of\r\nform and precedent; indifference to obstacles and opposition; and a\r\njoyous, sympathetic, loving spirit that runs over and inundates\r\neverything it touches, all with no special thought of personal pleasure,\r\ngratification or gain.\r\n\r\nLinnæus seems in every way to fill the formula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS H. HUXLEY]\r\n\r\nTHOMAS H. HUXLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n     That man, I think, has a liberal education whose body has been so\r\n     trained in youth that it is the ready servant of his will, and does\r\n     with ease and pleasure all that, as a mechanism, it is capable of;\r\n     whose intellect is a clear, cold, logic engine, with all its parts\r\n     of equal strength and in smooth running order, ready, like a\r\n     steam-engine, to be turned to any kind of work and to spin the\r\n     gossamers as well as forge the anchors of the mind; whose mind is\r\n     stored with the knowledge of the great fundamental truths of Nature\r\n     and the laws of her operations; one who, no stunted ascetic, is\r\n     full of life and fire, but whose passions have been trained to come\r\n     to heel by a vigorous will, the servant of a tender conscience; one\r\n     who has learned to love all beauty, whether of Nature or of art, to\r\n     hate all vileness, and to esteem others as himself.\r\n\r\n     --_Thomas Henry Huxley_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS H. HUXLEY\r\n\r\nThat was a great group of thinkers to which Huxley belonged.\r\n\r\nThe Mutual Admiration Society forms the sunshine in which souls\r\ngrow--great men come in groups. Sir Francis Galton says there were\r\nfourteen men in Greece in the time of Pericles who made Athens possible.\r\nA man alone is only a part of a man.\r\n\r\nPraxiteles by himself could have done nothing. Ictinus might have drawn\r\nthe plans for the Parthenon, but without Pericles the noble building\r\nwould have remained forever the stuff which dreams are made of. And they\r\ndo say that without Aspasia Pericles would have been a mere dreamer of\r\ndreams, and Walter Savage Landor overheard enough of their conversation\r\nto prove it.\r\n\r\nWilliam Morris and seven men working with him formed the Preraphaelite\r\nBrotherhood and gave the workers and doers of the world an impetus they\r\nyet feel.\r\n\r\nCambridge and Concord had seven men who induced the Muses to come to\r\nAmerica and take out papers.\r\n\r\nThese men of the Barbizon School tinted the entire art world: Millet,\r\nRousseau, Daubigny, Corot, Diaz. And the people who worked a complete\r\nrevolution in the theological thought of Christendom were these:\r\nDarwin, Spencer, Mill, Tyndall, Wallace, Huxley and, yes, George Eliot,\r\nwho bolstered the brain of Herbert Spencer when he was learning to think\r\nfor himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the victory had become a rout, there were many others who joined\r\nforces with the evolutionists; but at first the thinkers named above\r\nstood together and received the rather unsavory gibes and jeers of those\r\nwho get their episcopopagy and science from the same source.\r\n\r\nDarwin was the only man in the group who was a university graduate, and\r\nhe once said that he owed nothing to his Alma Mater, save the stimulus\r\nderived from her disapproval.\r\n\r\nFor the work these men had to do there was no precedent: no one had gone\r\nbefore and blazed a trail.\r\n\r\nLearning, like capital, is timid; but ignorance coupled with a desire to\r\nknow, is bold. Do I then make a plea for ignorance? Yes, most assuredly.\r\nIt is just as well not to know so much, as to be a theologian and know\r\nso many things that are not true.\r\n\r\nLearning and institutions of learning subdue men into conformity; only\r\nthe man who belongs to nothing is free; and ignorance, as well as a\r\ncertain indifference to what the world has said and done, is a necessary\r\nfactor in the character of him who would do a great work. It was the\r\ncombined ignorance and boldness of Columbus that made it possible for\r\nhim to give the world a continent.\r\n\r\nYet the man who has not had a college training often feels he has\r\nsomehow missed something valuable: there is timidity and hesitation when\r\nhe is in the presence of those who have had \"advantages.\" And Huxley\r\nfelt this loss, more or less, up to his thirty-fifth year, when Fate had\r\nhim cross swords with college men, and then the truth became his that if\r\nhe had had the regular university training, it was quite probable that\r\nhe would have accepted the doctrines the universities taught, and would\r\nthen have been in the camp of the \"enemy,\" instead of with what he\r\ncalled the \"blessed minority.\"\r\n\r\nIsolation is a great aid to the thinker. Some of the best books the\r\nworld has ever known were written behind prison-bars; exile has done\r\nmuch for literature, and a protracted sea-voyage has allowed many a good\r\nman to roam the universe in imagination. Some of Macaulay's best essays\r\nwere written on board slow-going sailing-ships that were blown by\r\nvagrant winds from England to India. Darwin, Hooker and Huxley, all got\r\ntheir scientific baptism on board of surveying-ships, where time was\r\nplentiful and anything but fleeting, and most everything else was\r\nscarce.\r\n\r\nHuxley was only assistant surgeon on the \"Rattlesnake,\" and above him\r\nwas a naturalist who much of his time lay in his bunk and read treatises\r\non this and also on that.\r\n\r\nHuxley was the seventh child of a plodding schoolteacher, born on the\r\nseventh day of the week on a seventh-floor back, he used to say. His\r\ngenius for work came from his mother, a tireless, ambitious woman, who\r\ngot things done while others were discussing them. \"Had she been a man,\r\nshe would have been leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons,\"\r\nher son used to say.\r\n\r\nCollege education was not for that goodly brood--a living was the first\r\nthing, so after a good drilling in the three R's, Thomas Huxley was\r\napprenticed to a pharmacist who paid him six shillings a week, a sum\r\nthat the boy conscientiously gave to his mother.\r\n\r\nOh, if in our schoolteaching we could only teach this one thing: a great\r\nthirst for knowledge! But this desire we can not impart: it is trial,\r\ndifficulty, obstacle, deprivation and persecution that make souls hunger\r\nand thirst after knowledge. Young Huxley wanted to know. His\r\nthoroughness in the drugstore won the admiration of the doctors whose\r\nprescriptions he compounded, and several of them loaned him books and\r\ntook him to clinics; and at seventeen we find him with a Free\r\nScholarship in Charing Cross Hospital, serving as nurse and assistant\r\nsurgeon. Then came the appointment as assistant surgeon in the Navy, and\r\nthe appointment to \"H.M.S. Rattlesnake,\" bound on a four-year trip to\r\nthe Antipodes, all quite as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nLife is a sequence: this happened today because you did that yesterday.\r\nTomorrow will be the result of today.\r\n\r\nThe general idea of evolution was strong in the mind of young Huxley. He\r\nrealized that Nature was moving, growing, changing all things. He had\r\nstudied embryology, and had seen how the body of a man begins as a\r\nsingle minute mass of protoplasm, without organs or dimensions.\r\n\r\nBehind the ship was his dragnet, and he worked almost constantly\r\nrecording the different specimens of animal and vegetable life that he\r\nthus secured. The jellyfish attracted him most.\r\n\r\nTo the ship's naturalist, jellyfish were jellyfish, but Huxley saw that\r\nthere were many kinds, distinct, separate, peculiar. He began to dissect\r\nthem and thus began his book on jellyfish, just as Darwin wrote his work\r\non barnacles.\r\n\r\nHuxley vowed to himself that before the \"Rattlesnake\" got back to\r\nEngland he would know more about jellyfish than any other living man.\r\nThat his ambition was realized no one now disputes.\r\n\r\nAmong his first discoveries, it came to him with a thrill that a certain\r\nspecies of jellyfish bears a very close resemblance to the human embryo\r\nat a certain stage.\r\n\r\nAnd he remembered the dictum of Goethe, that the growth of the\r\nindividual mirrors the growth of the race. And he paraphrased it thus:\r\n\"The growth of the individual mirrors the growth of the species.\" So\r\nfilled was he with the thought that he could not sleep, so he got up and\r\npaced the deck and tried to explain his great thought to the second\r\nmate. He was getting ready for \"The Origin of Species,\" which he once\r\nsaid to Darwin he would himself have written, if Darwin had been a\r\nlittle more of a gentleman and had held off for a few years.\r\n\r\nIt was on board the \"Rattlesnake\" that Huxley wrote this great truth:\r\n\"Nature has no designs or intentions. All that live exist only because\r\nthey have adapted themselves to the hard lines that Nature has laid\r\ndown. We progress as we comply.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Australia, while waiting for his ship to locate and map a dangerous\r\nreef, Huxley went ashore, and as he playfully expressed it, \"ran upon\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of the most excellent young woman who was to become his wife\r\nwas Henrietta Heathorn; and Julian Hawthorne has discovered that she\r\nbelongs to the same good stock from whence came our Nathaniel of Salem.\r\n\r\nIt did not take the young naturalist and this stranded waif, seven\r\nthousand miles from home, long to see that they had much in common. Both\r\nwere eager for truth, both had the ability to cut the introduction and\r\nreach live issues directly. \"I saw you were a woman with whom only\r\nhonesty would answer,\" he wrote her thirty years after. He was still in\r\nlove with her.\r\n\r\nYet she was a proud soul, and no assistant surgeon on an insignificant\r\nsloop would answer her--when he got his surgeon's commission she would\r\nmarry him. And it was seven years before she journeyed to England alone\r\nwith that delightful object in view. He had to serve for her as Jacob\r\ndid for Rachel, with this difference: Jacob loved several, but Thomas\r\nHuxley loved but one.\r\n\r\nHuxley's wife was his companion, confidante, comrade, friend. I can not\r\nrecall another so blest, in all the annals of thinking men, save John\r\nStuart Mill. \"I tell her everything I know, or guess, or imagine, so as\r\nto get it straight in my own mind,\" he said to John Fiske.\r\n\r\nIn that most interesting work, \"Life and Lessons of Huxley,\" compiled by\r\nhis son Leonard, are constant references and allusions to this most\r\nideal mating. In reply to the question, Is marriage a failure? I would\r\nsay, \"No, provided the man marries a woman like Huxley's wife, and the\r\nwoman marries a man like Huxley.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a classic aphorism which runs about this way, \"Knock and the\r\nworld knocks with you; boost and you boost alone.\" Like most popular\r\nsayings this is truth turned wrong side out.\r\n\r\nJohn Fiske once called Thomas Huxley an \"appreciative iconoclast.\" That\r\nis to say, Huxley was a persistent protester (which is different from a\r\nprotestant), and at the same time, he was a friend who never faltered\r\nand grew faint in time of trouble. Huxley always sniffed the battle from\r\nafar and said, Ha! Ha!\r\n\r\nThere be those who do declare that the success of Huxley was owing to\r\nhis taking the tide at the flood, and riding into high favor on the\r\nDarwinian wave. To say that there would have been no Huxley had there\r\nbeen no Darwin would be one of those unkind cuts the cruelty of which\r\nlies in its truth.\r\n\r\nIt is equally true that if there had been no Lincoln there would have\r\nbeen no Grant; but Grant was a very great man just the same--so why\r\nraise the issue!\r\n\r\nDarwin summed up and made nebulæ of the truths which Huxley had, up to\r\nthat time, held only in gaseous form.\r\n\r\nDarwin was born in the immortal year Eighteen Hundred Nine. Huxley was\r\nborn in Eighteen Hundred Twenty-five. When \"The Origin of Species\" was\r\npublished in Eighteen Hundred Fifty-nine, Thomas Huxley was thirty-four\r\nyears old. He had made his four years' trip around the world on the\r\nsurveying-ship \"Rattlesnake,\" just as Darwin had made his eventful\r\nvoyage on the \"Beagle.\"\r\n\r\nThese men in many ways had paralleled each other; but Darwin had sixteen\r\nyears the start, and during these years he had steadily and silently\r\nworked to prove the great truth that he had sensed intuitively years\r\nbefore in the South Seas.\r\n\r\n\"The Origin of Species\" sheds light in ten thousand ways on the fact\r\nthat all life has evolved from very lowly forms and is still ascending:\r\nthat species were not created by fiat, but that every species was the\r\nsure and necessary result of certain conditions.\r\n\r\nUntil \"The Origin of Species\" was published, and for some years\r\nafterward, the Immutability of Species was taught in all colleges, and\r\neverywhere accepted by the so-called learned men.\r\n\r\nGoethe had somewhat dimly prophesied the discovery of the Law of\r\nEvolution, but his ideas on natural science were regarded by the schools\r\nas quite on a par with those of Dante: neither was taken seriously.\r\n\r\nDarwin proved his hypothesis. Doubtless, very many schoolmen would have\r\naccepted the theory, but to admit that man was not created outright,\r\ncomplete, and in his present form, or superior to it, seemed to evolve a\r\ncontradiction of the Mosaic account of Creation, and the breaking up of\r\nChristianity. And these things done, many thought, would entail moral\r\nchaos, destruction of private interests and moral confusion being one\r\nand the same thing to those whose interests are involved. And so for\r\nconscience' sake, Darwin was bitterly assailed and opposed.\r\n\r\nOpportunity, which knocks many times at each man's door, rapped hard at\r\nHuxley's door in Eighteen Hundred Sixty. It was at Oxford, at a meeting\r\nof the British Association for the Advancement of Science: \"A big\r\nsociety with a slightly ironical name,\" once said Huxley. The audience\r\nwas large and fashionable, delegates being present from all parts of the\r\nBritish Empire.\r\n\r\n\"The Origin of Species\" had been published the year before, and tongues\r\nwere wagging. Darwin was not present; but Huxley, who was known to be a\r\npersonal friend of Darwin, was in his seat. The intent of the chairman\r\nwas to keep Darwin and his pestiferous book out of all the discussions:\r\nDarwin was a good man to smother with silence.\r\n\r\nBut Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, in the course of a speech on\r\nanother subject began to run short of material, and so switched off upon\r\na theme which he had already exploited from the pulpit with marked\r\neffect. All public speakers carry this boiler-plate matter for use in\r\ntime of stress.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop began to denounce \"those enemies of the Church and Society\r\nwho make covert attacks upon the Bible in the name of Science.\" He\r\nwarmed to his theme, and by a specious series of misstatements and\r\nvarious appeals to the prejudices of his audience worked the assemblage\r\nup to a high pitch of hilarity and enthusiasm. Toward the close of his\r\nspeech he happened to spy Huxley seated near, and pointing a pudgy\r\nfinger at him, \"begged to be informed if the learned gentleman was\r\nreally willing to be regarded as a descendant of a monkey?\"\r\n\r\nAs the Bishop sat down, there was a wild burst of applause and much\r\nlaughter, but amid the din were calls, \"Huxley! Huxley!\" These shouts\r\nincreased as it came over the people that while the Bishop had made a\r\ngreat speech, he had gone a trifle too far in ridiculing a member who up\r\nto this time had been silent. The good English spirit of fair play was\r\nat work. Still Huxley sat silent. Then the enemy, thinking he was\r\ncompletely vanquished, took up the cry with intent to add to his\r\ndiscomfiture: \"Huxley! Huxley!\"\r\n\r\nSlowly Huxley arose. He stood still until the last buzzing whisper had\r\ndied away. When he spoke it was in so low a tone that people leaned\r\nforward to catch his words.\r\n\r\nHuxley knew his business: his slowness to speak created an atmosphere.\r\nThere was no jest in his voice or manner. The air grew tense.\r\n\r\nHis quiet reserve played itself off against the florid exuberance of the\r\nBishop. The Bishop was not a man given to exact statements: his\r\nknowledge of science was general, not specific.\r\n\r\nHuxley demolished his card house point by point, correcting the gross\r\nmisstatements, and ending by saying that since a question of personal\r\npreferences had been brought into the discussion of a great scientific\r\ntheme, he would confess that if the alternatives were a descent on the\r\none hand from a respectable monkey, or on the other from a Bishop of the\r\nChurch of England who could stoop to misrepresentation and sophistry and\r\nwho had attempted in that presence to throw discredit upon a man who had\r\ngiven his life to the cause of science, then if forced to decide he\r\nwould declare in favor of the monkey.\r\n\r\nWhen Huxley took his seat, there was a silence that could be felt.\r\nSeveral ladies fainted. There were fears that the Bishop would reply,\r\nand to keep down such a possible unpleasant move the audience now\r\napplauded Huxley roundly, and amid the din the chairman declared the\r\nmeeting adjourned.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forward Huxley was famous throughout England as a man to\r\nlet alone in public debate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a fine thing to be a great scientist, but it is a yet finer thing\r\nto be a great man. The one element in Huxley's life that makes his\r\ncharacter stand out clear, sharp and well defined was his steadfast\r\ndevotion to truth. The only thing he feared was self-deception. When he\r\nuttered his classic cry in defense of Darwin, there was no ulterior\r\nmotive in it; no thought that he was attaching himself to a popular\r\nsuccess; no idea that he was linking his name with greatness.\r\n\r\nWhat he felt was true, he uttered; and the strongest desire of his soul\r\nwas that he might never compromise with the error for the sake of mental\r\nease, or accept a belief simply because it was pleasant.\r\n\r\nHuxley once wrote this terse sentence of Gladstone: \"It is to me a\r\nserious thing that the destinies of this great country should at present\r\nbe to a great extent in the hands of a man who, whatever he may be in\r\nthe affairs of which I am no judge, is nothing but a copious shuffler in\r\nthose that I do understand.\" Gladstone crossed swords with Huxley,\r\nSpencer and Robert Ingersoll, and in each case his blundering intellect\r\nlooked like a raft of logs compared with a steamboat that responds to\r\nthe helm. Gladstone was a man of action, and silence to such is most\r\nbecoming.\r\n\r\nHe had a belief, that was enough; he should have hugged it close, and\r\nnever stood up to explain it. Let us vary a simile just used: Lincoln\r\nonce referred to an opponent as being \"like a certain steamboat that\r\nran on the Sangamon. This boat had so big a whistle that when she blew\r\nit, there wasn't steam enough to make her run, and when she ran she\r\ncouldn't whistle.\"\r\n\r\nHuxley, Spencer and Robert Ingersoll, all made Gladstone cut for the\r\nwoods and cover his retreat in a cloud of words. Ingersoll once said\r\nthat in replying to Gladstone he felt like a man who had been guilty of\r\ncruelty to children.\r\n\r\nIf one wants to see how pitifully weak Gladstone could be in an\r\nargument, let him refer to the \"North American Review\" for Eighteen\r\nHundred Eighty-two.\r\n\r\nYet Ingersoll was surely lacking in the passion for truth that\r\ncharacterized Huxley. Ingersoll was always a prosecutor or a defender:\r\nthe lawyer habit was strong upon him. Just a little more bias in his\r\nclay and he would have made a model bishop.\r\n\r\nHis stock of science was almost as meager as was that of Samuel\r\nWilberforce, and he seldom hesitated to turn the laugh on an adversary,\r\neven at the expense of truth. When brought to book for his indictment of\r\nMoses without giving that great man any credit for the sublime things he\r\ndid do, or making allowances for the barbaric horde with which he had to\r\ndeal, Bob evaded the proposition by saying, \"I am not the attorney of\r\nMoses: he has more than three million men looking after his case.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in that most charming lecture on Shakespeare, Ingersoll proves\r\nthat Bacon did not write the plays, by picking out various detached\r\npassages of Bacon, which no one for a moment ever claimed revealed the\r\ngenius of the man.\r\n\r\nWith equal plausibility we could prove that the author of Hamlet was a\r\nweakling, by selecting all the obscure and stupid passages, and parading\r\nthese with the unexplained fact that the play opens with the spirit of a\r\ndead man coming back to earth, and a little later in the same play\r\nShakespeare has the man who interviewed the ghost tell of \"that bourne\r\nfrom whence no traveler returns.\" Even Shakespeare was not a genius all\r\nthe time. And Ingersoll, the searcher for truth, borrowed from his\r\nfriends, the priests, the cheerful habit of secreting the particular\r\nthing that would not help the cause in hand. But one of the best things\r\nin Ingersoll's character was that he realized his lapses and in private\r\nacknowledged them.\r\n\r\nOn reading the smooth, florid and plausible sophistry of Wilberforce,\r\nIngersoll once said: \"Be easy on Soapy Sam! A few years ago, a little\r\nshifting of base on the part of my ancestors, and I would probably have\r\nhad Soapy Sam's job.\"\r\n\r\nThis resemblance of opposites makes a person think of that remark\r\napplied to Voltaire. \"He was the father of all those who wear\r\nshovel-hats.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas Huxley and his wife arrived in New York in Eighteen Hundred\r\nSeventy-six, on a visit to the Centennial Exhibition, this interesting\r\nitem was flashed over the country, \"Huxley and his titled bride have\r\narrived in New York on their wedding-journey.\"\r\n\r\nThis item caused Mr. and Mrs. Huxley--both of them royal democrats--more\r\njoy than did the most complimentary interview. At home they had left a\r\ncharming little brood of seven children, three of them nearly grown-ups.\r\n\r\nHuxley sent Tyndall, who a few months before had married a daughter of\r\nLord Hamilton, the clipping and this note: \"You see how that once I am\r\nin a democratic country I am pulling all the honors I can in my own\r\ndirection.\" The next letter the Huxleys received from Tyndall was\r\naddressed, \"Sir Thomas and Lady Huxley.\" Huxley never stood in much awe\r\nof the nobility; he evidently felt that there was another kind of which\r\nhe himself in degree was heir. Huxley never had a better friend than Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker, and we see in his letters such postscripts as this:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir Joseph: Do come and dine with us; it is a month since we have\r\nseen your homely old phiz.\" And Sir Joseph replies that he will be on\r\nhand the next Sunday evening and offers this mild suggestion,\r\n\"Scientific gents as has countenances as curdles milk should not cast\r\naspersions on men made in image of Maker.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe wordy duel between Huxley and Gladstone prompted Toole, the great\r\ncomedian, to send a box of grease-paints to Huxley with a note saying,\r\n\"These are for you and Gladstone to use when you make up.\" It was a joke\r\nso subtle and choice that the Huxleys, always dear friends of Toole,\r\nlaughed for a week.\r\n\r\nPoor Gladstone required a diagram when he heard of the procedure; and\r\nthen, not being trepanned for the pleasantry, remarked that if Toole and\r\nHuxley collaborated on the stage, it would be eminently the proper\r\nthing, and in his mind there was little choice between them, both being\r\nfine actors.\r\n\r\nLater, we hear of Huxley saying he thought of sending the box of\r\ngrease-paints to Gladstone, so the Premier could use them in making up\r\nwith God; as for himself, he was like Thoreau and had never quarreled\r\nwith Him.\r\n\r\nHuxley had many friendships with people seemingly outside of his own\r\nparticular line of work. Henry Irving, the Reverend Doctor Parker, John\r\nFiske and Hall Caine once met at one of Huxley's \"Tall Teas,\" and Doctor\r\nParker explained that he personally had no objection to visiting with\r\nsinners.\r\n\r\nFor Parker, Huxley had a great admiration and often attended the\r\nThursday noon meeting at the Temple, \"to see and hear the greatest actor\r\nin England,\" a compliment which Parker much appreciated, otherwise he\r\nwould not have repeated it. \"If I ever take to the stage, I will play\r\nthe part of Jacques or Touchstone,\" said Huxley.\r\n\r\nJohn Fiske in his delightful essay on Huxley said that in the Huxley\r\nhome there was more jest, joke and banter than in any other place in\r\nLondon. The air was surcharged with mirth, and puns, often very bad\r\nones, were tossed back and forth with great recklessness.\r\n\r\nAt one time John Fiske was at the Huxleys and the dual or multiple\r\nnature of man came up for discussion. Huxley spoke of how very often men\r\nwho were gentle and charming in their homes were capable of great\r\ncrimes, and of how, on the other hand, a man might pass in the world as\r\na philanthropist, and yet in his household be a veritable autocrat and\r\ntyrant.\r\n\r\nFiske then incidentally mentioned the case of Doctors Parker and Webster\r\nof Harvard--men of intellect and worth. These men brooded over a\r\nmisunderstanding that grew into a grudge and eventually hatched murder.\r\nOne worthy professor killed the other, cut up the body, and tried to\r\nburn it in a chemist's retort. Only the great difficulty of reducing the\r\nhuman body to ashes caused the murder to out, and brought about the\r\nhanging of a scientist of note.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have thought of the difficulty of disposing of a dead body,\"\r\nsaid Huxley, solemnly; \"and often when on the point of committing murder\r\nthis was the only thing that made me hesitate!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Pater, we are ashamed of you,\" said his three lovely daughters in\r\nconcert. Huxley's ability to joke and his appreciation of the ludicrous\r\nmarked him, in the mind of John Fiske, as the greatest thinker of his\r\ntime. The humorist knows values, and that is why he laughs. Sensibility\r\nis, in fact, the basic element of wit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHuxley's duties on the \"Rattlesnake\" were not in the line of science.\r\nHis rank was assistant surgeon; but as sure-enough surgeons were only\r\nsent out on bigger craft, he was this ship's doctor.\r\n\r\nWith the captain's help the men were kept busy, but not too busy, and\r\nthe food and regulations were such that about all Huxley had to do was\r\nto look upon his work and pronounce it good.\r\n\r\nAs a physician, Huxley practised throughout his life the science of\r\nprevention.\r\n\r\n\"With a prophetic vision, quite unconscious, my parents named me after\r\nthat particular apostle I was to admire most,\" once said Huxley. He was\r\na doubter by instinct, and approached the world of Nature as if nothing\r\nwere known about it.\r\n\r\nHis work on the Medusa won him the recognition of the British Society,\r\nand this secured him the coveted surgeon's commission. Two tragedies\r\nconfront man on his journey through life--one when he wants a thing and\r\ncan not get it; the other when he gets the thing and finds he does not\r\nwant it.\r\n\r\nHaving secured his surgeon's commission, Huxley felt a strong repulsion\r\ntoward devoting his life to the abnormal.\r\n\r\n\"I am a scientist by nature, and my business is to teach,\" he wrote to\r\nhis affianced wife. These were wise words which he had learned from her,\r\nbut which he repeated, seemingly quite innocent of their source. We\r\ntake our own wherever we find it.\r\n\r\nMiss Heathorn admired a surgeon, but loved a scientist, and Huxley being\r\na man was making a heroic struggle to be what the young woman most\r\nwished. Love supplies an ideal--and that is the very best thing love\r\ndoes, with possibly an exception or two. So behold a ship's surgeon in\r\nLondon, full-fledged, refusing offers of position, and even declining to\r\ntake a choice of ships, for such is the perversity of things animate and\r\ninanimate that, when we do not want things, Fate brings them to us on\r\nsilver platters and begs us to accept. We win by indifference as much as\r\nby desire.\r\n\r\n\"I have declined to ship on board the 'Cormorant' as head surgeon, and\r\nhave applied to the University of Toronto for a position as Professor of\r\nNatural History.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so America had Huxley flung at her head. Toronto considered, and the\r\nCanadians sat on the case, and after considerable correspondence, the\r\nvacant chair was given to Professor Baldini of the Whitby Ladies\r\nCollege. It was a close call for Canada! Huxley had imagined that the\r\nNew World offered special advantages to a rising young person of\r\nscientific bent, but now he secured a marriage-license and settled down\r\nas lecturer at the School of Mines. A little later he began to teach at\r\nthe Royal College of Surgeons, with which institution he was to be\r\nconnected the rest of his life, and fill almost any chair that happened\r\nto be vacant.\r\n\r\nFrom the time he was twenty-seven Huxley never had to look for work. He\r\nwas known as a writer of worth, and as a lecturer his services were in\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nHe became President of the Geological and Ethnological Society; was\r\nappointed Royal Commissioner for the Advancement of Science; was a\r\nmember of the London School Board; Secretary of the Royal Society; Lord\r\nRector of the University of Aberdeen; President of the Royal Society;\r\nand refused an offer to become Custodian of the British Museum, a life\r\nposition, and where he had once applied for a clerkship.\r\n\r\nIn letters to Darwin he occasionally signed his name with all titles\r\nadded, thus, \"Thomas Henry Huxley, M.B., M.D., Ph.D., LL.D., F.R.S. of\r\nHer Majesty's Navy.\"\r\n\r\nHuxley was a forceful and epigrammatic writer, and had a command of\r\nEnglish second to no scientist that England has ever produced. He was\r\nthe only one of his group who had a distinct literary style. As a\r\nspeaker he was quiet, deliberate, decisive, sure; and he carried enough\r\nreserve caloric so that he made his presence felt in any assemblage\r\nbefore he said a word. In oratory it is personality that gives ballast.\r\n\r\nOf his forty or so published books, \"Man's Place in Nature,\" \"Elementary\r\nPhysiology\" and \"Classification of Animals\" have been translated into\r\nmany languages, and now serve as textbooks in various schools and\r\ncolleges.\r\n\r\nHuxley is the founder of the so-called Agnostic School, which has the\r\npeculiarity of not being a school. The word \"agnostic\" was given its\r\nvogue by Huxley. To superficial people it was quite often used\r\nsynonymously with \"infidel\" and \"freethinker,\" both words of reproach.\r\nTo Huxley it meant simply one who did not know, but wished to learn.\r\n\r\nThe controlling impulse of Huxley's life was his absolute honesty. To\r\npretend to believe a thing against which one's reason revolts, in order\r\nto better one's place in society, was to him the sum of all that was\r\nintellectually base.\r\n\r\nHe regarded man as an undeveloped creature, and for this creature to lay\r\nthe flattering unction to his soul that he was in special communication\r\nwith the Infinite, and in possession of the secrets of the Creator, was\r\nsomething that in itself proved that man was as yet in the barbaric\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nSaid Huxley: \"As to the final truths of Creation and Destiny, I am an\r\nagnostic. I do not know, hence I neither affirm nor deny.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHumor and commonsense usually go together. Huxley had a goodly stock of\r\nboth. When George Eliot died, there was a very earnest but ill-directed\r\neffort made to have her body buried in Westminster Abbey. Huxley, being\r\nclose to the Dean, serving with him on several municipal boards, was\r\nimportuned by Spencer to use his influence toward the desired end.\r\nHuxley saw the incongruity of the situation, and in a letter that\r\nreveals the logical mind and the direct, literary, Huxley quality, he\r\nplaced his gentle veto on the proposition and thus saved the \"enemy\" the\r\nmortification of having to do so.\r\n\r\nDarwin is buried in Westminster Abbey, but this was not to be the final\r\nresting-place of the dust of Mill, Tyndall, Spencer, George Eliot or\r\nHuxley. These had all stood in the fore of the fight against\r\nsuperstition and had both given and received blows.\r\n\r\nThe Pantheon of such battle-scarred heroes was to be the hearts of those\r\nwho prize above all that earth can bestow the benison of the God within.\r\n\"Above all else, let me preserve my integrity of intellect,\" said\r\nHuxley. Here is Huxley's letter to Spencer:\r\n\r\n     4 Marlborough Place, Dec. 27, 1880\r\n\r\n     My Dear Spencer: Your telegram which reached me on Friday evening\r\n     caused me great perplexity, inasmuch as I had just been talking to\r\n     Morley, and agreeing with him that the proposal for a funeral in\r\n     Westminster Abbey had a very questionable look to us, who desired\r\n     nothing so much as that peace and honor should attend George Eliot\r\n     to her grave.\r\n\r\n     It can hardly be doubted that the proposal will be bitterly\r\n     opposed, possibly (as happened in Mill's case with less\r\n     provocation) with the raking up of past histories, about which the\r\n     opinion even of those who have least the desire or the right to be\r\n     pharisaical is strongly divided, and which had better be forgotten.\r\n\r\n     With respect to putting pressure on the Dean of Westminster, I have\r\n     to consider that he has some confidence in me, and before asking\r\n     him to do something for which he is pretty sure to be violently\r\n     assailed, I have to ask myself whether I really think it a right\r\n     thing for a man in his position to do.\r\n\r\n     Now I can not say I do. However much I may lament the circumstance,\r\n     Westminster Abbey is a Christian Church and not a Pantheon, and the\r\n     Dean thereof is officially a Christian priest, and we ask him to\r\n     bestow exceptional Christian honors by this burial in the Abbey.\r\n     George Eliot is known not only as a great writer, but as a person\r\n     whose life and opinions were in notorious antagonism to Christian\r\n     practise in regard to marriage, and Christian theory in regard to\r\n     dogma. How am I to tell the Dean that I think he ought to read over\r\n     the body of a person who did not repent of what the Church\r\n     considers mortal sin, a service not one solitary proposition of\r\n     which she would have accepted for truth while she was alive? How am\r\n     I to urge him to do that which, if I were in his place, I should\r\n     most emphatically refuse to do? You tell me that Mrs. Cross wished\r\n     for the funeral in the Abbey. While I desire to entertain the\r\n     greatest respect for her wishes, I am very sorry to hear it. I do\r\n     not understand the feeling which could create such a desire on any\r\n     personal grounds, save those of affection, and the natural yearning\r\n     to be near, even in death, those whom we have loved. And on public\r\n     grounds the wish is still less intelligible to me. One can not eat\r\n     one's cake and have it too. Those who elect to be free in thought\r\n     and deed must not hanker after the rewards, if they are to be so\r\n     called, which the world offers to those who put up with its\r\n     fetters.\r\n\r\n     Thus, however I look at the proposal, it seems to me to be a\r\n     profound mistake, and I can have nothing to do with it. I shall be\r\n     deeply grieved if this resolution is ascribed to any other motives\r\n     than those which I have set forth at greater length than I\r\n     intended.\r\n                             Ever yours very faithfully,\r\n                                                 T. H. HUXLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN TYNDALL]\r\n\r\nJOHN TYNDALL\r\n\r\n\r\n     In my little book on Faraday, published in Eighteen Hundred\r\n     Sixty-eight, I have stated that he had but to will it to raise his\r\n     income, in Eighteen Hundred Thirty-two, to five thousand pounds a\r\n     year. In Eighteen Hundred Thirty-six, the sum might have been\r\n     doubled. Yet this son of a blacksmith, this journeyman book-binder,\r\n     with his proud, sensitive soul, rejecting the splendid\r\n     opportunities open to him--refusing even to think them splendid in\r\n     presence of higher aims--cheerfully accepted from the Trinity House\r\n     a pittance of two hundred pounds a year.\r\n\r\n     --_John Tyndall_\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN TYNDALL\r\n\r\nTyndall was of high descent and lowly birth. His father was a\r\nmember of the Irish Constabulary, and there were intervals when the\r\nboy's mother took in washing. But back of this the constable swore i'\r\nfaith, when the ale was right, that he was descended from an Irish King,\r\nand probably this is true, for most Irishmen are, and acknowledge it\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe father of our Tyndall spelled his name Tyndale, and traced a direct\r\nrelationship to William Tyndale, who declared he would place a copy of\r\nthe English Bible in the hands of every plowboy in the British Isles,\r\nand pretty nearly made good his vow. William Tyndale paid for his\r\nprivileges, however. He was arrested, given an opportunity to run away,\r\nbut wouldn't; then he was exiled. Finally he was incarcerated in a\r\ndungeon of the Castle Vilvoorden.\r\n\r\nHis cell was beneath the level of the ground, so was cold and damp and\r\ndark. He petitioned the governor of the prison for a coat to keep him\r\nwarm and a candle by which he could read. \"We'll give you both light and\r\nheat, pretty soon,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nAnd they did. They led Tyndale out under the blue sky and tied him to a\r\nstake set in the ground. Around his feet they piled brush, and also all\r\nof his books and papers that they could find.\r\n\r\nA chain was put around his neck and hooked tight to the post. Then the\r\nfagots were piled high, and the fire was lighted.\r\n\r\n\"He was not burned to death,\" argued one of the priests who was present;\r\n\"he was not burned to death. He just drew up his feet and hanged himself\r\nin the chain, and so was choked: he was that stubborn!\" The father of\r\nJohn Tyndall was an Orangeman and had in a glass case a bit of the flag\r\ncarried at the Battle of the Boyne.\r\n\r\nIt is believed, with reason, that the original flag had in it about ten\r\nthousand square yards of material. Tyndale the Orangeman was of so\r\nuncompromising a type that he occasionally arrested Catholics on general\r\nprinciples, like the Irishman who beat the Jew under the mistaken idea\r\nthat he had something to do with crucifying \"Our Savior.\" \"But that was\r\ntwo thousand years ago,\" protested the Jew. \"Niver moind; I just heard\r\nav it--take that and that!\"\r\n\r\nZeal not wisely directed is a true Irish trait. It will not do to say\r\nthat the Irish have a monopoly on stupidity, yet there have been times\r\nwhen I thought they nearly cornered the market. I once had charge of a\r\ngang of green Irishmen at a lumber-camp.\r\n\r\nI started a night-school for their benefit, as their schooling had\r\nstopped at subtraction. One evening they got it into their heads that I\r\nwas an atheist. Things began to come my way. I concluded discretion was\r\nthe better part of valor, and so took to the woods, literally. They\r\nfollowed me for a mile, and then gave up the chase. On the way home they\r\nmet a man who spoke ill of me, and they fell upon him and nearly pounded\r\nhis life out.\r\n\r\nI never had to lick any of my gang: they looked after this themselves.\r\nOn pay-nights they all got drunk and fell upon each other--broken noses\r\nand black eyes were quite popular. Father Driscoll used to come around\r\nnearly every month and have them all sign the pledge.\r\n\r\nThat story about the Irishman who ate the rind of the watermelon \"and\r\nthrew the inside away,\" is true. That is just what the Irish do. Very\r\noften they are not able to distinguish good from bad, kindness from\r\nwrong, love from hate. Ireland has all the freedom she can use or\r\ndeserves, just as we all have. What would Ireland do with freedom if she\r\nhad it? Hate for England keeps peace at home. Home rule would mean home\r\nrough-house--and a most beautiful argument it would be, enforced with\r\nshillalah logic. The spirit of Donnybrook Fair is there today as much as\r\never, and wherever you see a head, hit it, would be home rule.\r\nDonnybrook is a condition of mind.\r\n\r\nIf England really had a grudge against Ireland and wanted to get even,\r\nshe could not do better than to set her adrift.\r\n\r\nBut then the Irish impulsiveness sometimes leads to good, else how could\r\nwe account for such men as O'Connor, Parnell, John Tyndall, Burke,\r\nGoldsmith, Sheridan, Arthur Wellesley and all the other Irish poets,\r\norators and thinkers who have made us vibrate with our kind?\r\n\r\nTransplanted weeds produce our finest flowers.\r\n\r\nThe parents of Tyndall were intent on giving their boy an education. And\r\nto them, the act of committing things to memory was education. William\r\nTyndale gave the Bible to the people; John Tyndall would force it upon\r\nthem. The \"Book of Martyrs,\" the sermons of Jeremy Taylor, and the\r\nBible, little John came to know by heart. And he grew to have a fine\r\ndistaste for all. Once, when nearly a man grown, he had the temerity to\r\nargue with his father that the Bible might be better appreciated, if a\r\npenalty were not placed upon disbelief in its divine origin. A cuff on\r\nthe ear was the answer, and John was given until sundown to apologize.\r\nHe did not apologize.\r\n\r\nAnd young Tyndale then vowed he would change his name to Tyndall and\r\nforever separate himself from a person whose religion was so largely\r\nmixed with brutality. But yet John Tyndale was not a bad man. He had\r\nintellect far above the average of his neighbors. He had the courage of\r\nhis convictions. His son had the courage of his lack of convictions.\r\n\r\nAnd the early drilling in the Bible was a good thing for young Tyndall.\r\nBible legend and allusion color the English language, and any man who\r\ndoes not know his Bible well, can never hope to speak or write English\r\nwith grace and fluency. Tyndall always knew and acknowledged his\r\nindebtedness to his parents, and he also knew that his salvation\r\ndepended upon getting away from and beyond the narrow confines of their\r\nbeliefs and habits. Because a thing helps you in a certain period of\r\nyour education is no reason why you should feed upon it forevermore.\r\n\r\nThis way lies arrested development.\r\n\r\nLife, like heat, is a mode of motion, and progress consists in\r\ndiscarding a good thing as soon as you have found a better.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOccasionally Herbert Spencer used to spend a Sunday afternoon with the\r\nCarlyles at their modest home in Chelsea. At such times Jeannie Welsh\r\nwould usually manage to pilot the conversational craft along smooth\r\nwaters; but if she were not present, hot arguments would follow, and\r\nfinally a point would be reached where Carlyle and Spencer would simply\r\nsit and glare at each other.\r\n\r\n\"After such scenes I always thought less of two persons, Carlyle and\r\nmyself,\" said Spencer; \"and so for many years I very cautiously avoided\r\nCheyne Row.\" Then there was another man Spencer avoided, although for a\r\ndifferent reason; this individual was John Tyndall.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Tyndall, Spencer wrote:\r\n\r\n\"There has just died the greatest teacher of modern times: a man who\r\nstimulated thought in old and young, every one he met, as no one else I\r\never knew did. Once we went together for a much-needed rest to the Lake\r\nDistrict. Gossip, which has its advantages in that it can be carried on\r\nwith no tax on one's intellectual powers, had no part in our\r\nconversation. The discussion of great themes began at once wherever\r\nTyndall was.\r\n\r\n\"The atmosphere of the man was intensely stimulating: everybody seemed\r\nto become great and wise and good in his presence.\r\n\r\n\"We walked on the shores of Windermere, climbed Rydal Mount, rowed\r\nacross Lake Grasmere (leaving our names on the visitors' list), and all\r\nthe time we dwelt upon high Olympus and talked.\r\n\r\n\"But, alas! Tyndall's vivacity undid me: two days of his company, with\r\ntwo sleepless nights, and I fled him as I would a pestilence.\"\r\n\r\nBut Carlyle growled out one thing in Spencer's presence which Spencer\r\noften quoted. \"If I had my own way,\" said Carlyle, \"I would send the\r\nsons of poor men to college, and the sons of rich men I would set to\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\nManual labor in right proportion means mental development. Too much hoe\r\nmay slant the brow, but hoe in proper proportion develops the\r\ncerebellum.\r\n\r\nIn the past we have had one set of men do all the work, and another set\r\nhad all the culture: one hoes and another thirsts. There are whole areas\r\nof brain-cells which are evolved only through the efforts of hand and\r\neye, for it is the mind at last that directs all our energies. The\r\ndevelopment of brain and body go together--manual work is brain-work.\r\nToo much brain-work is just as bad as too much toil; the misuse of the\r\npen carries just as severe a penalty as the misuse of the hoe. And it is\r\na great satisfaction to realize that the thinking world has reached a\r\npoint where these propositions do not have to be proven.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when Spencer regretted that he had not been sent to\r\ncollege, instead of being set to work. But later he came to regard his\r\nexperience as a practical engineer and surveyor as a very precious and\r\nnecessary part of his education.\r\n\r\nJohn Tyndall and Alfred Russel Wallace had an experience almost\r\nidentical. In childhood John attended the village school for six months\r\nof the year, and the rest of the time helped his parents, as children of\r\npoor people do. When nineteen he went to work carrying a chain in a\r\nsurveying corps. Steady attention to the business in hand brought its\r\nsure reward, and in a few years he had charge of the squad, and was\r\ngiven the duty of making maps and working out complex calculations in\r\nengineering.\r\n\r\nIn mathematics he especially excelled. Five years in the employ of the\r\nIrish Ordnance Survey and three years in practical railroad-building,\r\nand Tyndall got the Socialistic bee in his bonnet. He resigned a good\r\nposition to take part in bringing about the millennium.\r\n\r\nThat he helped the old world along toward the ideal there is no doubt;\r\nbut Tyndall is dead and Jerusalem is not yet. When the rule of the\r\nbarons was broken, and the stage of individualism or competition was\r\nushered in, men said, \"Lo! The time is at hand and now is.\" But it was\r\nnot. Socialism is coming, by slow degrees, imperceptibly almost as the\r\ngrowing of Spring flowers that push their way from the damp, dark earth\r\ninto the sunlight. And after Socialism, what? Perhaps the millennium\r\nwill still be a long way off.\r\n\r\nIn Eighteen Hundred Forty-seven, when Tyndall was twenty-seven years\r\nold, Robert Owen, one of the greatest practical men the world has ever\r\nseen, cried aloud, \"The time is at hand!\"\r\n\r\nOwen was an enthusiast: all great men are. He had risen from the ranks\r\nby the absolute force of his great untiring, restless and loving spirit.\r\nFrom a day laborer in a cotton-mill he had become principal owner of a\r\nplant that supported five thousand people.\r\n\r\nOwen saw the difference between joyless labor and joyful work. His mills\r\nwere cleanly, orderly, sanitary, and surrounded with lawns, trees and\r\nshrubbery. He was the first man in England to establish kindergartens,\r\nand this he did at his own expense for the benefit of his helpers. He\r\nestablished libraries, clubs, swimming-pools, night-schools,\r\nlecture-courses. And all this time his business prospered.\r\n\r\nTo the average man it is a miracle how any one individual could bear the\r\nheaviest business burdens and still do what Robert Owen did.\r\n\r\nRobert Owen had vitality plus: he was a gourmet for work. William Morris\r\nwas just such a man, only with a bias for art; but both Owen and Morris\r\nhad the intensity and impetus which get the thing done while common\r\nfolks are thinking about it.\r\n\r\nOwen was familiar with every detail of his vast business, and he was an\r\nexpert in finance. Like Napoleon he said: \"The finances? I will arrange\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Owen erected schoolhouses, laid out gardens, built mills,\r\nconstructed tenements, traveled, lectured, and wrote books. His\r\nenthusiasm was contagious. He was never sick--he could not spare the\r\ntime--and a doctor once said, \"If Robert Owen ever dies, it will be\r\nthrough too much Robert Owen.\"\r\n\r\nOwen went over to Dublin on one of his tours, and lectured on the ideal\r\nlife, which to him was Socialism, \"each for all and all for each.\"\r\n\r\nFourier, the dreamer, supplied a good deal of the argument, but Robert\r\nOwen did the thing. Socialism always catches these two classes, doers\r\nand dreamers, workers and drones, honest men and rogues, those with a\r\ndesire to give and those with a lust to get.\r\n\r\nAmong others who heard Owen speak at Dublin was the young Irish\r\nengineer, John Tyndall. Tyndall was the type of man that must be common\r\nbefore we can have Socialism. There was not a lazy hair in his head;\r\naye, nor a selfish one, either. He had a tender heart, a receptive brain\r\nand the spirit of obedience, the spirit that gives all without counting\r\nthe cost, the spirit that harkens to the God within. And need I say that\r\nthe person who gives all, gets all! The economics of God are very\r\nsimple: We receive only that which we give. The only love we keep is the\r\nlove we give away.\r\n\r\nThese are very old truths--I did not discover nor invent them--they are\r\nnot covered by copyright: \"Cast thy bread upon the waters.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Tyndall was melted by Owen's passionate appeal of each for all and\r\nall for each. To live for humanity seemed the one desirable thing. His\r\nloving Irish heart was melted. He sought Owen out at his hotel, and they\r\ntalked, talked till three o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nOwen was a judge of men; his success depended upon this one thing, as\r\nthat of every successful business must. He saw that Tyndall was a rare\r\nsoul and nearly fulfilled his definition of a gentleman. Tyndall had\r\nhope, faith and splendid courage; but best of all, he had that hunger\r\nfor truth which classes him forever among the sacred few.\r\n\r\nDuring his work out of doors on surveying trips he had studied the\r\nstrata; gotten on good terms with birds, bugs and bees; he knew the\r\nflowers and weeds, and loved all the animate things of Nature, so that\r\nhe recognized their kinship to himself, and he hesitated to kill or\r\ndestroy.\r\n\r\nEducation is a matter of desire, and a man like Tyndall is getting an\r\neducation wherever he is. All is grist that comes to his mill.\r\n\r\nRobert Owen had but recently started \"Queenswood College\" in Hampshire,\r\nand nothing would do but Tyndall should go there as a teacher of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\"Is he a skilled and educated teacher?\" some one asked Owen. \"Better\r\nthan that,\" replied Owen; \"he is a regular firebrand of enthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so Tyndall resigned his position with the railroad and moved over to\r\nEngland, taking up his home at \"Harmony Hall.\"\r\n\r\nHarmony Hall was a beautiful brick building with the letters C. M.\r\ncarved on the cornerstone in recognition of the Commencement of the\r\nMillennium. The pupils were mostly workers in the Owen mills who had\r\nshown some special aptitude for education. The pupils and teachers all\r\nworked at manual labor a certain number of hours daily. There was a\r\ndelightful feeling of comradeship about the institution. Tyndall was\r\nhappy in his work.\r\n\r\nHe gave lectures on everything, and taught the things that no one else\r\ncould teach, and of course he got more out of the lessons than any of\r\nthe scholars.\r\n\r\nBut after a few months' experience with the ideal life, Tyndall had\r\ncommonsense enough to see that Harmony Hall, instead of being the\r\nspontaneous expression of the people who shared its blessings, was\r\nreally a charity maintained by one Robert Owen. It was a beneficent\r\nautocracy, a sample of one-man power, beautifully expressed.\r\n\r\nRobert Owen planned it, built it, directed it and made good any\r\nfinancial deficit. Instead of Socialism it was a kindly despotism. A few\r\nof the scholars did their level best to help themselves and help the\r\nplace, but the rest didn't think and didn't care. They were passengers\r\nwho enjoyed the cushioned seats. A few, while partaking of the\r\nprivileges of the place, denounced it.\r\n\r\n\"You can not educate people who do not want to be educated,\" said\r\nTyndall. The value of an education lies in the struggle to get it. Do\r\ntoo much for people, and they will do nothing for themselves.\r\n\r\nMany of the students at Harmony Hall had been sent there by Owen,\r\nbecause he, in the greatness of his heart and the blindness of his zeal,\r\nthought they needed education. They may have needed it; but they did not\r\nwant it: ease was their aim.\r\n\r\nThe indifference and ingratitude Robert Owen met with did not discourage\r\nhim: it only gave him an occasional pause. He thought that the bad\r\nexample of English society was too close to his experiments: it vitiated\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSo he came over to America and founded the town of New Harmony, Indiana.\r\nThe fine solid buildings he erected in Posey County, then a wilderness,\r\nare still there.\r\n\r\nAs for the most romantic and interesting history of New Harmony, Robert\r\nOwen and his socialistic experiments, I must refer the gentle reader to\r\nthe Encyclopedia Britannica, a work I have found very useful in the\r\ncourse of making my original researches.\r\n\r\nAfter a year at Harmony Hall, Tyndall saw that he would have to get out\r\nor else become a victim of arrested development, through too much\r\nacceptance of a strong man's bounty. \"You can not afford to accept\r\nanything for nothing,\" he said. Life at Harmony Hall to him was very\r\nmuch like life in a monastery, to which stricken men flee when the old\r\nworld seems too much for them. \"When all the people live the ideal life,\r\nI'll live it; but until then I'm only one of the great many strugglers.\"\r\nBesides, he felt that in missing university training he had dropped\r\nsomething out of his life. Now he would go to Germany and see for\r\nhimself what he had missed.\r\n\r\nWhile railroading he had saved up nearly four hundred pounds. This money\r\nhe had offered at one time to invest in shares in the Owen mills. But\r\nRobert Owen said, \"Wait two years and then see how you feel!\"\r\n\r\nRobert Owen was not a financial exploiter. Tyndall may have differed\r\nwith him in a philosophic way; but they never ceased to honor and\r\nrespect each other.\r\n\r\nAnd so John Tyndall bade the ideal life good-by, and went out into the\r\nstress, strife and struggle, resolved to spend his two thousand dollars\r\nin bettering his education, and then to start life anew.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRobert Owen had been over to America and had met Emerson, and very\r\nnaturally caught it. When he returned home he gave young Tyndall a copy\r\nof Emerson's first book, the \"Essay on Nature,\" published anonymously.\r\n\r\nTyndall read and re-read the book, and read it aloud to others and spoke\r\nof it as a \"message from the gods.\"\r\n\r\nHe also read every word that Carlyle put in print. It was Carlyle who\r\nintroduced him to German philosophy and German literature, and fired him\r\nwith a desire to see for himself what Germany was doing.\r\n\r\nGermany had still another mystic tie that drew him thitherward. It was\r\nat Marburg, Germany, that his illustrious namesake had published his\r\ntranslation of the Bible.\r\n\r\nAt Marburg there was a University, small, 't was true, but its\r\nsimplicity and the cheapness of living there were recommendations. So to\r\nMarburg he went. Tyndall found lodgings in a little street called\r\n\"Heretics' Row.\" Possibly there be people who think that Tyndall's\r\ntaking a room in such a street was chance, too. Chance is natural law\r\nnot understood.\r\n\r\nMarburg is a very lovely little town that clings amid a forest of trees\r\nto the rocky hillside overlooking the River Lahn. Tyndall was very happy\r\nat Marburg, and at times very miserable. The beauty of the place\r\nappealed to him. He was a climber by nature, and the hills were a\r\ncontinual temptation.\r\n\r\nBut the language was new; and before this his work had all been of a\r\npractical kind. College seems small and trivial after you have been in\r\nthe actual world of affairs. But Tyndall did not give up. He rose every\r\nmorning at six, took his cold bath, dressed and ran up the hill half a\r\nmile and back. He breakfasted with the family, that he might talk\r\nGerman. Then he dived into differential calculus and philosophical\r\nabstrusities. He was not sent to college: he went. And he made college\r\ngive up all it had. On the wall of his room, as a sort of ornamental\r\nfrieze in charcoal, he wrote this from Emerson: \"High knowledge and\r\ngreat strength are within the reach of every man who unflinchingly\r\nenacts his best.\"\r\n\r\nDown in the town was a bronze bust of a man who wrote for it the\r\nfollowing inscription: \"This is the face of a man who has struggled\r\nenergetically.\"\r\n\r\nOne might almost imagine that Hawthorne had received from Tyndall the\r\nhint which evolved itself into that fine story, \"The Great Stone Face.\"\r\n\r\nThe bust just mentioned, attracted John Tyndall for another reason:\r\nCarlyle had written of the man it symboled: \"Reader, to thee, thyself,\r\neven now, he has one counsel to give, the secret of his whole poetic\r\nalchemy. Think of living! Thy life, wert thou the pitifullest of all the\r\nsons of earth, is no idle dream, but a solemn reality. It is thine own;\r\nit is all thou hast with which to front eternity. Work, then, even as he\r\nhas done--like a star, unhasting and unresting.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Marburg, Tyndall was on good terms with the great Bunsen, and used to\r\nact as his assistant in making practical chemical experiments before his\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nThese amazing things done by chemists in public are seldom of much value\r\nbeyond giving a thrill to visitors who would otherwise drowse; it is\r\nlike humor in an oration: it opens up the mental pores.\r\n\r\nAlexander Humboldt once attended a Bunsen lecture at Marburg and\r\ncomplimented Tyndall by saying, \"When I take up sleight-of-hand work,\r\nconsider yourself engaged as my first helper.\" Tyndall's way of standing\r\nwith his back to the audience, shutting off the view of Bunsen's hands\r\nwhile he was getting ready to make an artificial peal of thunder, made\r\nHumboldt laugh heartily.\r\n\r\nHumboldt thought so well of the young man who spoke German with an Irish\r\naccent, that he presented him with an inscribed copy of one of his\r\nbooks. The volume was a most valuable one, for Humboldt published only\r\nin deluxe, limited editions, and Tyndall was so overcome that all he\r\ncould say was, \"I'll do as much for you some day.\" Not long after this,\r\nthrough loaning money to a fellow student, Tyndall found himself sadly\r\nin need of funds, and borrowed two pounds on the book from an 'Ebrew\r\nJew.\r\n\r\nThat night, he dreamed that Humboldt found the volume in a secondhand\r\nstore. In the morning, Tyndall was waiting for the pawnbroker to open\r\nhis shop to get the book back ere the offense was discovered.\r\n\r\nHeinrich Heine once inscribed a volume of his poems to a friend, and\r\nafterward discovered the volume on the counter of a secondhand dealer.\r\nHe thereupon haggled with the bookman, bought the book and beneath his\r\nfirst inscription wrote, \"With the renewed regards of H. Heine.\" He then\r\nsent the volume for the second time to his friend. 'T is possible that\r\nTyndall had heard of this.\r\n\r\nIn Eighteen Hundred Fifty, when Tyndall was thirty years of age, he\r\nvisited London, and of course went to the British Institution. There he\r\nmet Faraday for the first time and was welcomed by him.\r\n\r\nThe British Institution consists of a laboratory, a museum and a\r\nlecture-hall, and its object is scientific research. It began in a very\r\nsimple way in one room and now occupies several buildings.\r\n\r\nIt was founded by Benjamin Thompson, an American, and so it was but\r\nproper that its sister concern, the Smithsonian Institution, should have\r\nbeen founded by an Englishman.\r\n\r\nSir Humphry Davy on being asked, \"What is your greatest discovery?\"\r\nreplied, \"Michael Faraday.\" But this was a mere pleasantry, the truth\r\nbeing that it was Michael Faraday who discovered Sir Humphry Davy.\r\nFaraday was a bookbinder's apprentice, a fact that should interest all\r\ngood Roycrofters.\r\n\r\nEvenings, when Sir Humphry Davy lectured at the British Institution,\r\nthe young bookbinder was there. After the lecture he would go home and\r\nwrite out what he had heard, with a few ideas of his own added. For be\r\nit known, taking notes at a lecture is a bad habit--good reporters carry\r\nno notebooks.\r\n\r\nAfter a year Faraday sent a bundle of his impressions and criticisms to\r\nSir Humphry Davy anonymously. Great men seldom read manuscript that is\r\nsent to them unless it refers to themselves. At the next lecture, Sir\r\nHumphry began by reading from Faraday's notes, and begged that if the\r\nwriter were present, he would make himself known at the close of the\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nFrom this was to ripen a love like that of father and son. Every man who\r\nbuilds up such a work as did Sir Humphry Davy is appalled, when he finds\r\nTime furrowing his face and whitening his hair, to think how few indeed\r\nthere are who can step in and carry his work on after he is gone.\r\n\r\nThe love of Davy for the young bookbinder was almost feverish: he\r\nclutched at this bright, impressionable and intent young man who entered\r\nso into the heart and soul of science; nothing would do but he must\r\nbecome his assistant. \"Give up all and follow me!\" And Faraday did.\r\n\r\nSomething of the same feeling must have swept over Faraday after his\r\nwork of twenty-five years as director of the British Institution, when\r\nJohn Tyndall appeared, tall, thin, bronzed, animated, quoting Bunsen\r\nand Humboldt with an Irish accent.\r\n\r\nAnd so in time Tyndall became assistant to Faraday, then lecturer in\r\nnatural history; and when Faraday died, Tyndall, by popular acclaim, was\r\nmade Fullerian Lecturer and took Faraday's place. This was to be his\r\nlife-work, and it so placed him before the world that all he said or did\r\nhad a wide significance and an extended influence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTyndall was always a most intrepid mountain-climber. The Alps lured him\r\nlike the song of the Lorelei, and the wonder was that his body was not\r\nleft in some mountain crevasse, \"the most beautiful and poetic of all\r\nburials,\" he once said.\r\n\r\nBut for him this was not to be, for Fate is fond of irony. The only man\r\nwho ever braved the full dangers of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado was\r\nkilled by a suburban train in Chicago while on his wedding-tour. Most\r\nbad men die in bed, tenderly cared for by trained nurses in white caps\r\nand big aprons.\r\n\r\nTyndall climbed to the summit of the Matterhorn, ascended the so-called\r\ninaccessible peak of the Weisshorn, scaled Mont Blanc three times, and\r\nonce was caught in an avalanche, riding toward death at the rate of a\r\nmile a minute. Yet he passed away from an overdose, or a wrong dose, of\r\nmedicine given him through mistake, by the hands of the woman he loved\r\nmost.\r\n\r\nAt one time Tyndall attempted to swim a mountain-torrent; the stream, as\r\nif angry at his Irish assurance, tossed him against the rocks, brought\r\nhim back in fierce eddies, and again and again threw him against a solid\r\nface of stone. When he was rescued he was a mass of bruises, but\r\nfortunately no bones were broken. It was some days before he could get\r\nout, and in his sorry plight, bandaged so his face was scarcely visible,\r\nSpencer found him. \"Herbert, do you believe in the actuality of\r\nmatter?\" was John's first question.\r\n\r\nBoth Tyndall and Huxley made application to the University of Toronto\r\nfor positions as teachers of science; but Toronto looked askance, as all\r\npioneer people do, at men whose college careers have been mostly\r\nconfined to giving college absent treatment.\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer avowed again and again that Tyndall was the greatest\r\nteacher he ever knew or heard of, inspiring the pupil to discover for\r\nhimself, to do, to become, rather than imparting prosy facts of doubtful\r\npith and moment. But Herbert Spencer, not being eligible to join a\r\nuniversity club himself, was possibly not competent to judge.\r\n\r\nAnyway, England was not so finical as Canada, and so she gained what\r\nCanada lost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTyndall paid a visit to the United States in the year Eighteen Hundred\r\nSeventy-two, and lectured in most of the principal cities, and at all\r\nthe great colleges. He was a most fascinating speaker, fluent, direct,\r\neasy, and his whole discourse was well seasoned with humor.\r\n\r\nWhenever he spoke, the auditorium was taxed to its utmost, and his\r\nreception was very cordial, even in colleges that were considered\r\nexceedingly orthodox.\r\n\r\nPossibly, some good people who invited him to speak did not know it was\r\nloaded; and so his earnest words in praise of Darwin and the doctrine of\r\nevolution, occasionally came like unto a rumble of his own artificial\r\nthunder. \"I speak what I think is truth; but of course, when I express\r\nungracious facts I try to do so in what will be regarded as not a nasty\r\nmanner,\" said Tyndall, thus using that pet English word in a rather\r\npleasing way.\r\n\r\nIn his statement that the prayer of persistent effort is the only prayer\r\nthat is ever answered, he met with a direct challenge at Oberlin. This\r\ngave rise to what, at the time, created quite a dust in the theological\r\nroad, and evolved \"The Tyndall Prayer Test.\"\r\n\r\nTyndall proposed that one hundred clergymen be delegated to pray for the\r\npatients in any certain ward of Bellevue Hospital. If, after a year's\r\ntrial, there was a marked decrease in mortality in that ward, as\r\ncompared with previous records, we might then conclude that prayer was\r\nefficacious, otherwise not.\r\n\r\nOne good clergyman in Pittsburgh offered publicly to debate \"Darwinism\"\r\nwith Tyndall, but beyond a little scattered shrapnel of this sort, the\r\nlecture-tour was a great success. It netted just thirteen thousand\r\ndollars, the whole amount of which Tyndall generously donated as a fund\r\nto be used for the advancement of natural science in America.\r\n\r\nIn Eighteen Hundred Eighty-five, this fund had increased to thirty-two\r\nthousand dollars, and was divided into three equal parts and presented\r\nto Columbia, Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. The fund was\r\nstill further increased by others who followed Professor Tyndall's\r\nexample, and Columbia, from her share of the Tyndall fund, I am told now\r\nsupports two foreign scholarships for the benefit of students who show a\r\nspecial aptitude in scientific research. Professor James of Harvard once\r\nsaid: \"The impetus to popular scientific study caused by Professor\r\nTyndall's lectures in the United States was most helpful and fortunate.\r\nSpeaking but for myself, I know I am a different man and a better man,\r\nfor having heard and known John Tyndall.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen John Tyndall died, in the year Eighteen Hundred Ninety-three,\r\nSpencer wrote:\r\n\r\n\"It never occurred to Tyndall to ask what it was politic to say, but\r\nsimply to ask what was true. The like has of late years been shown in\r\nhis utterances concerning political matters--shown, it may be, with too\r\ngreat frankness. This extreme frankness was displayed also in private,\r\nand sometimes, perhaps, too much displayed; but every one must have the\r\ndefects of his qualities. Where absolute sincerity exists, it is certain\r\nnow and then to cause an expression of a feeling or opinion not\r\nadequately restrained.\r\n\r\n\"But the contrast in genuineness between him and the average citizen was\r\nvery conspicuous. In a community of Tyndalls (to make a rather wild\r\nsupposition), there would be none of that flabbiness characterizing\r\ncurrent thought and action--no throwing overboard of principles\r\nelaborated by painful experience in the past, and adoption of a\r\nhand-to-mouth policy unguided by any principle. He was not the kind of\r\nman who would have voted for a bill or a clause which he secretly\r\nbelieved would be injurious, out of what is euphemistically called\r\n'party loyalty,' or would have endeavored to bribe each section of the\r\nelectorate by 'ad captandum' measures, or would have hesitated to\r\nprotect life and property for fear of losing votes. What he saw right to\r\ndo he would have done, regardless of proximate consequences.\r\n\r\n\"The ordinary tests of generosity are very defective. As rightly\r\nmeasured, generosity is great in proportion to the amount of self-denial\r\nentailed; and where ample means are possessed, large gifts often entail\r\nno self-denial. Far more self-denial may be involved in the performance,\r\non another's behalf, of some act that requires time and labor. In\r\naddition to generosity under its ordinary form, which Professor Tyndall\r\ndisplayed in unusual degree, he displayed it under a less common form.\r\n\r\n\"He was ready to take much trouble to help friends. I have had personal\r\nexperience of this. Though he had always in hand some investigation of\r\ngreat interest to him, and though, as I have heard him say, when he bent\r\nhis mind to the subject he could not with any facility break off and\r\nresume it again, yet, when I have sought scientific aid, information or\r\ncritical opinion, I never found the slightest reluctance to give me his\r\nundivided attention. Much more markedly, however, was this kind of\r\ngenerosity shown in another direction. Many men, while they are eager\r\nfor appreciation, manifest little or no appreciation of others, and\r\nstill less go out of their way to express it.\r\n\r\n\"With Tyndall it was not thus; he was eager to recognize achievement.\r\nNotably in the case of Michael Faraday, and less notably, though still\r\nconspicuously in many cases, he has bestowed much labor and sacrificed\r\nmany weeks in setting forth the merits of others. It was evidently a\r\npleasure to him to dilate on the claims of fellow workers.\r\n\r\n\"But there was a derivative form of this generosity calling for still\r\ngreater eulogy. He was not content with expressing appreciation of those\r\nwhose merits were recognized, but he used energy unsparingly in drawing\r\nthe attention of the public to those whose merits were unrecognized;\r\ntime after time in championing the cause of such, he was regardless of\r\nthe antagonism he aroused and the evil he brought upon himself. This\r\nchivalrous defense of the neglected and ill-used has been, I think by\r\nfew, if any, so often repeated. I have myself more than once benefited\r\nby his determination, quite spontaneously shown, that justice should be\r\ndone in the apportionment of credit; and I have with admiration watched\r\nlike actions of his in other cases: cases in which no consideration of\r\nnationality or of creed interfered in the least with his insistence on\r\nequitable distribution of honors.\r\n\r\n\"In this undertaking to fight for those who were unfairly dealt with, he\r\ndisplayed in another direction that very conspicuous trait which, as\r\ndisplayed in his Alpine feats, has made him to many persons chiefly\r\nknown: I mean courage, passing very often into daring. And here let me,\r\nin closing this little sketch, indicate certain mischiefs which this\r\ntrait brought upon him. Courage grows by success. The demonstrated\r\nability to deal with dangers produces readiness to meet more dangers,\r\nand is self-justifying where the muscular power and the nerve habitually\r\nprove adequate. But the resulting habit of mind is apt to influence\r\nconduct in other spheres, where muscular power and nerve are of no\r\navail--is apt to cause the daring of dangers which are not to be met by\r\nstrength of limb or by skill. Nature as externally presented by\r\nprecipice ice-slopes and crevasses may be dared by one who is adequately\r\nendowed; but Nature, as internally represented in the form of physical\r\nconstitution, may not be thus dared with impunity. Prompted by high\r\nmotives, John Tyndall tended too much to disregard the protests of his\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\"Over-application in Germany caused absolute sleeplessness, at one time,\r\nI think he told me, for more than a week; and this, with kindred\r\ntransgressions, brought on that insomnia by which his after-life was\r\ntroubled, and by which his power for work was diminished; for, as I have\r\nheard him say, a sound night's sleep was followed by a marked exaltation\r\nof faculty.\r\n\r\n\"And then, in later life, came the daring which, by its results, brought\r\nhis active career to a close. He conscientiously desired to fulfil an\r\nengagement to lecture at the British Institution, and was not deterred\r\nby fear of consequences.\r\n\r\n\"He gave the lecture, notwithstanding the protest which for days before\r\nhis system had been making. The result was a serious illness,\r\nthreatening, as he thought at one time, a fatal result; and\r\nnotwithstanding a year's furlough for the recovery of health, he was\r\neventually obliged to resign his position. But for this defiance of\r\nNature, there might have been many more years of scientific exploration,\r\npleasurable to himself and beneficial to others; and he might have\r\nescaped that invalid life which for a long time he had to bear.\r\nIn his case, however, the penalties of invalid life had great\r\nmitigations--mitigations such as fall to the lot of few.\r\n\r\n\"It is conceivable that the physical discomforts and mental weariness\r\nwhich ill-health brings may be almost, if not quite, compensated by the\r\npleasurable emotions caused by unflagging attentions and sympathetic\r\ncompanionship. If this ever happens, it happened in his case. All who\r\nhave known the household during these years of nursing are aware of the\r\nunmeasured kindness he has received without ceasing. I happen to have\r\nhad special evidence of this devotion on the one side and gratitude on\r\nthe other, which I do not think I am called upon to keep to myself, but\r\nrather to do the contrary. In a letter I received from him some\r\nhalf-dozen years ago, referring, among other things, to Mrs. Tyndall's\r\nself-sacrificing care of him, occurred this sentence: 'She has raised my\r\nideal of the possibilities of human nature.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE]\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Amok\" is an innovation which I do not recommend. It consists in\r\n     letting go when things get too bad, and doing damage with tongue,\r\n     hands and feet. It is the tantrum carried to its logical\r\n     conclusion. I saw one instance where a henpecked husband \"ran amok\"\r\n     and killed or wounded seventeen people before he himself was\r\n     killed. It is the national and therefore the honorable mode of\r\n     committing suicide among the natives of Celebes, and is the\r\n     fashionable way of escaping from their difficulties. A man can not\r\n     pay, he is taken for a slave, or has gambled away his wife or child\r\n     into slavery, he sees no way of recovering what he has lost, and\r\n     becomes desperate. He will not put up with such cruel wrongs, but\r\n     will be revenged on mankind and die like a hero. He grasps his\r\n     knife, and the next moment draws out the weapon and stabs a man to\r\n     the heart. He runs on with bloody kris in his hand, stabbing every\r\n     one he meets. \"Amok! Amok!\" then resounds through the streets.\r\n     Spears, krises, knives, guns and clubs are brought out against him.\r\n     He rushes madly forward, kills all he can--men, women and\r\n     children--and dies, overwhelmed by numbers, amid all the excitement\r\n     of a battle.\r\n\r\n     --_Alfred Russel Wallace, in \"The Malay Archipelago\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE\r\n\r\nThe question of how this world and all the things in it were made,\r\nhas, so far as we know, always been asked. And volunteers have at no\r\ntime been slow about coming forward and answering. For this service the\r\nvolunteer has usually asked for honors and also exemption from toil more\r\nor less unpleasant.\r\n\r\nHe has also demanded the joy of riding in a coach, being carried in a\r\npalanquin, and sitting on a throne clothed in purple vestments, trimmed\r\nwith gold lace or costly furs. Very often the volunteer has also\r\ninsisted on living in a house larger than he needed, having more food\r\nthan his system required, and drinking decoctions that are costly, spicy\r\nand peculiar.\r\n\r\nAll of which luxury has been paid for by the people, who are told that\r\nwhich they wish to hear.\r\n\r\nThe success of the volunteer lies in keeping one large ear close to the\r\nturf.\r\n\r\nReligious teachers have ever given to their people a cosmogony that was\r\nadapted to their understanding.\r\n\r\nWho made it? God made it all. In how long a time? Six days. And then\r\nfollowed explanations of what God did each day.\r\n\r\nOver against the volunteers with a taste for power and a fine corkscrew\r\ndiscrimination, there have been at rare intervals men with a desire to\r\nknow for the sake of knowing. They were not content to accept any man's\r\nexplanation. The only thing that was satisfying to them was the\r\nconsciousness that they were inwardly right. Loyalty to the God within\r\nwas the guiding impulse of their lives.\r\n\r\nIn the past, such men have been regarded as eccentric, unreliable and\r\ndangerous, and the volunteers have ever warned their congregations\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nIndeed, until a very few years ago they were not allowed to express\r\nthemselves openly. Laws have been passed to suppress them, and dire\r\npenalties have been devised for their benefit. Laws against sacrilege,\r\nheresy and blasphemy still ornament our statute-books; but these\r\ninvented crimes that were once punishable by death are now obsolete, or\r\nexist in rudimentary forms only, and manifest themselves in a refusal to\r\ninvite the guilty party to our Four-o'Clock. This hot intent to support\r\nand uphold the volunteers in their explanations of how the world was\r\nmade, is a universal manifestation of the barbaric state, and is based\r\nupon the assumption that God is an infinite George the Fourth.\r\n\r\nSix hundred years before Christ, Anaximander, the Greek, taught that\r\nanimal life was engendered from the earth through the influence of\r\nmoisture and heat, and that life thus generated gradually evolved into\r\nhigher and different forms: all animals once lived in the water, but\r\nsome of them becoming stranded on land put forth organs of locomotion\r\nand defense, through their supreme resolve to live. Anaximander also\r\ntaught that man was only a highly developed animal, and his source of\r\nlife was the same as that of all other animals; man's present high\r\ndegree of development having gradually come about through growth from\r\nvery lowly forms.\r\n\r\nAnaxagoras, the schoolmaster of Pericles, also made similar statements,\r\nand then we find him boldly putting forth the very startling idea that\r\nbetween the highest type of Greek and the lowest type of savage there\r\nwas a greater difference than between the savage and the ape. He also\r\ntaught that the earth was the universal mother of all living things,\r\nanimal and vegetable, and that the fecundation of the earth took place\r\nfrom minute, unseen germs that floated in the air.\r\n\r\nAccording to modern science, Anaxagoras was very close upon the trail of\r\ntruth. But there were only a very few who could follow him, and it took\r\nthe combined eloquence and tact of Pericles to keep his splendid head in\r\nthe place where Nature put it, and Pericles himself was compromised by\r\nhis leaning toward \"Darwinism.\"\r\n\r\nEvery man who speaks, expresses himself for others. We succeed only as\r\nour thought is echoed back to us by others who think the same. If you\r\nlike what I say it is only because it is already yours. Moreover,\r\nthought is a collaboration, and is born of parents. If a teacher does\r\nnot get a sympathetic hearing, one of two things happens: he loses the\r\nthread of his thought and grows apathetic, or he arouses an opposition\r\nthat snuffs out his life.\r\n\r\nAnd the dead they soon grow cold.\r\n\r\nThe recipe for popularity is to hunt out a weakness of humanity and then\r\nbank on it. No one knows this better than your theological volunteer.\r\nAristotle, the father of natural history, who early in life had a\r\nPegasus killed under him, taught that the diversity in animal life was\r\ncaused by a diversity of conditions and environment, and he declared he\r\ncould change the nature of animals by changing their surroundings. This\r\nbeing true he argued that all animals were once different from what they\r\nare now, and that if we could live long enough, we would see that\r\nspecies are exceedingly variable.\r\n\r\nTo explain to child-minds that a Supreme Being made things outright just\r\nas they are, is easy; but to study and in degree know how things\r\nevolved, requires infinite patience and great labor. It also means small\r\nsympathy from the indifferent whom the earth has spawned in swarms, and\r\nthe hatred of the volunteers who ride in coaches, and tell the many what\r\nthey wish to hear.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers drove Aristotle into exile, and from his time they had\r\ntheir way for two thousand years, when John Ray, Linnæus and Buffon\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nIn Seventeen Hundred Fifty-five, Immanuel Kant, the little man who\r\nstayed near home and watched the stars tumble into his net, put forth\r\nhis theory that every animal organism in the world was developed from a\r\ncommon original germ.\r\n\r\nIn Seventeen Hundred Ninety-four, Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of\r\nCharles Darwin, inspired by Kant and Goethe, put forth his book,\r\n\"Zoonomia,\" wherein he maintained the gradual growth and evolution of\r\nall organisms from minute, unseen germs. These views were put forth more\r\nas a poetic hypothesis than as a well-grounded scientific fact, so\r\nlittle attention was paid to Erasmus Darwin's books. The fanciful\r\naccounts of Creation put forth by Moses three thousand years before were\r\nfirmly maintained by the entrenched volunteers and their millions of\r\ndevotees and followers.\r\n\r\nBut Kant, Goethe, Karl von Baer and August de Sainte-Hilaire were now\r\nplanting their outposts throughout the civilized world, honeycombing\r\nChristendom with doubt.\r\n\r\nIn the year Eighteen Hundred Fifty-two, Herbert Spencer had argued in\r\npublic and in pamphlets that species have undergone changes and\r\nmodifications through change of surroundings, and that the account of\r\nNoah and his ark, with pairs of everything that flew, crept or ran, was\r\nfanciful and absurd, so far as we cared to distinguish fact from\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year Eighteen Hundred Fifty-eight, Charles Darwin received\r\nfrom his friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, a paper entitled, \"On the\r\nTendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type.\" At\r\nthis time Darwin had in the hands of the secretary of the Linnæus\r\nSociety a paper entitled, \"On the Tendency of Species to Form Varieties,\r\nor the Perpetuation of Species and Varieties by Means of Natural\r\nSelection.\"\r\n\r\nThe similarity in title, as well as the similarity in treatment of the\r\nWallace theme, startled Darwin. He had been working on the idea for\r\ntwenty years, and had an immense mass of data bearing on the subject,\r\nwhich he some day intended to issue in book form.\r\n\r\nHis paper for the Linnæus Society simply summed up his convictions. And\r\nnow here was a man with whom he had never discussed this particular\r\nsubject, writing an almost identical paper and sending it to him--of all\r\nmen!\r\n\r\nWell did he pinch his leg, and call in his wife, asking her if he were\r\nalive or dead. Straightway he went to see Sir Charles Lyell and Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker, both more eminent than he in the scientific world, and\r\nlaid the matter before them. After a long conference it was decided that\r\nboth papers should be read the same evening before the Linnæus Society,\r\nand this was done on the evening of July First, Eighteen Hundred\r\nFifty-eight.\r\n\r\nDarwin then decided to publish his \"Origin of Species,\" which in his\r\npreface he modestly calls an \"Abstract.\" The publication was hastened by\r\nthe fact that Wallace was compiling a similar work. After giving Wallace\r\nfull credit in his most interesting \"Introduction,\" and reviewing all\r\nthat others had said in coming to similar conclusions, Darwin fired his\r\nshot heard round the world. And no man was more delighted and pleased\r\nwith the echoing reverberations than Alfred Russel Wallace, as he read\r\nthe book in far-off Australia.\r\n\r\nThe honor of discovering the Law of Evolution, and lifting it out of the\r\nhazy realms of hypothesis and poetry into the sunlight of science, will\r\never be shared between Charles Robert Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace,\r\nwho were indeed brothers in spirit and lovers to the end of their days.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn an insignificant village of England, now famous alone because he\r\nbegan from there his explorations of the world, Alfred Russel Wallace\r\nwas born, in the year Eighteen Hundred Twenty-two. He was one of a large\r\nfamily of the middle class, where work is as natural as life, and the\r\nindispensable virtues are followed as a means of self-preservation. It\r\nis most unfortunate to attain such a degree of success that you think\r\nyou can waive the decalogue and give Nemesis the slip.\r\n\r\nAbout the year Eighteen Hundred Forty, the railroad renaissance was on\r\nin England, and young Wallace, alive, alert, active, did his turn as\r\napprentice to a surveyor.\r\n\r\nChance is a better schoolmaster than design. All boys have a taste for\r\ntent life, and healthy youngsters not quite grown, with ostrich\r\ndigestions, passing through the nomadic stage, revel in hardships and\r\ncount it a joy to sleep on the ground where they can look up at the\r\nstars, and eat out of a skillet.\r\n\r\nA little later we find Alfred working for his elder brother in an\r\narchitect's office, gazing abstractedly out of the window betimes, and\r\nwishing he were a ground-squirrel, fancy free on the heath and amid the\r\nheather, digging holes, thus avoiding introspection. \"Houses are\r\nprisons,\" he said, and sang softly to himself the song of the open road.\r\n\r\nI think I know exactly how Alfred Russel Wallace then felt, from the\r\ntouchstone of my own experience; and I think I know how he looked, too,\r\nall confirmed by an East Aurora incident.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, one fine day in May, I was helping excavate for the\r\nfoundation of a new barn. All at once I felt that some one was standing\r\nbehind me looking at me. I turned around and there was a tall, lithe,\r\nslender youth in a faded college cap, blue flannel shirt, ragged\r\ntrousers and top-boots. My first impression of him was that he was a\r\nfellow who slept in his clothes, a plain \"Weary,\" but when he spoke\r\nthere was a note of self-reliance in his low, well-modulated voice that\r\ntold me he was no mendicant. Voice is the true index of character.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Wallace, and I have a note to you from my father,\" and he\r\nbegan diving into pockets, and finally produced a ragged letter that was\r\nnearly worn out through long contact with a perspiring human form\r\ndivine--or partially so. I seldom make haste about reading letters of\r\nintroduction, and so I greeted the young man with a word of welcome, and\r\ngave him a chance to say something for himself.\r\n\r\nHe was English, that was very sure--and Oxford English at that. \"You\r\nsee,\" he began, \"I am working just now over on the Hamburg and Buffalo\r\nElectric Line, stringing wires. I get three dollars a day because I'm a\r\nfairly good climber. I wanted to learn the business, so I just hired out\r\nas a laborer, and they gave me the hardest job, thinking to scare me\r\nout, but that was what I wanted,\" and he smiled modestly and showed a\r\nset of incisors as fine and strong as a dog's teeth. \"I want to remain\r\nwith you for a week and pay for my board in work,\" he cautiously\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n\"But about your father, Mr. Wallace--do I know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so; he has written you several letters--Alfred Russel Wallace!\"\r\n\r\nYou could have knocked me down with a lady's-slipper. I opened the\r\nletter and unmistakably it was from the great scientist, \"introducing my\r\nbaby boy.\"\r\n\r\nI never met Alfred Russel Wallace, but I know if I should, I would find\r\nhim very gentle, kindly and simple in all his ways--as really great men\r\never are. He would not talk to me in Latin nor throw off technical\r\nphrases about great nothings, and I would feel just as much at home with\r\nhim as I did with Ol' John Burroughs the last time I saw him, leaning up\r\nagainst a country railroad-station in shirt-sleeves, chewing a straw,\r\nexchanging salutes with the engineer on a West Shore jerkwater. \"S'\r\nlong, John!\" called the going one as he leaned out of the cab-window.\r\n\"S' long, Bill, and good luck to you,\" was the cheery answer.\r\n\r\nBut still, all of us have moments when we think of the world's most\r\nfamous ones as being surely eight feet tall, and having voices like\r\nfog-horns.\r\n\r\n\"I can do most any kind of hard work, you know\"--I was aroused from my\r\nlittle mental excursion, and noticed that my visitor had hair of a\r\nlight yellow like a Swede from Hennepin County, Minnesota, and that his\r\nhair was three shades lighter than his bronzed face. \"I can do any kind\r\nof work, you know, and if you will just loan me that pick\"--and I handed\r\nhim the pickax.\r\n\r\nYoung Wallace remained with us for a week, asking for nothing, doing\r\neverything, even to helping the girls wash dishes. That he was the son\r\nof a great man, no one would have ever learned from his own lips. In\r\nfact, I am not sure that he was impressed with his father's excellence,\r\nbut I saw there was a tender bond between them, for he haunted the\r\npost-office, morning, noon and night, looking for a letter from his\r\nfather. When it came he was as happy as a woodchuck. He showed me the\r\nletter: it was nine finely written pages.\r\n\r\nBut to my disappointment not a word about marsupials, siamangs or\r\nSyndactylæ: just news about John, William, Mary and Benjamin; with\r\nreferences to chickens and cows, and a new greenhouse, with a little\r\ngood advice about keeping right hours and not overeating.\r\n\r\nThe young man had spent three years at Oxford, and was an electrical\r\nengineer. He was intent on finding out just as much about the secrets of\r\nAmerican railroad construction as he possibly could. As for intellect, I\r\ndid not discover any vast amount; perhaps, for that matter, he didn't\r\neither. But we all greatly enjoyed his visit, and when he went away I\r\npresented him with a clean, secondhand flannel shirt and my blessing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the appearance of the young man I imagine that Alfred Russel\r\nWallace at twenty-one was very much such a man as his son, who did such\r\ngood work at the Roycroft with pick and shovel. Alfred was earnest,\r\nintent, strong, and had a deal of quiet courage that he was as\r\nunconscious of as he was of his digestion.\r\n\r\nHe taught school, and to interest his scholars he would take them on\r\nbotanical excursions. Then he himself grew interested, and began to\r\ncollect plants, bugs, beetles and birds on his own account.\r\n\r\nBy Eighteen Hundred Forty-eight, the confining walls of the school had\r\nbecome intolerable to Wallace, and he started away on a wild-goose chase\r\nto Brazil, with a chum by the name of Henry Walter Bates, an ardent\r\nentomologist. Alfred had no money either, but Bates had influence, and\r\nhe cashed it in by arranging with the Curator of the British Museum,\r\nthat any natural-history specimens of value which they might gather and\r\nsend to him would be paid for. And so something like a hundred pounds\r\nwas collected from several scientific men, and handed over as advance\r\npayment for the wonderful things that the young men were to send back.\r\n\r\nThey embarked on a sailing-vessel that was captained by a kind kinsman\r\nof Bates, so the fare was nil, in consideration of services rendered\r\nconstructively.\r\n\r\nArriving in Brazil the young men began their collecting of specimens.\r\nThey got together a very creditable collection of birds' eggs and sent\r\nthem back by the captain of the ship they came out on, this as an\r\nearnest of what was to come.\r\n\r\nBates and Wallace were together for a year. Bates insisted on remaining\r\nnear the white settlements; but Wallace wanted to go where white men had\r\nnever been. So alone he went into the forests, and for two years lived\r\nwith the natives and dared the dangers of jungle-fever, snakes,\r\ncrocodiles and savages. For a space of ten months he did not see a\r\nsingle white person.\r\n\r\nHe collected nearly ten thousand specimens of birds, which he skinned\r\nand carefully prepared so they could be mounted when he returned to\r\nEngland; there was also a nearly complete Brazilian herbarium, and a\r\nfiner collection of birds' eggs than any museum of England could boast.\r\n\r\nThis collection represented over three years' continuous toil. All the\r\ncurious things were packed with great care and placed on board ship.\r\n\r\nAnd so the young naturalist sailed away for England, proud and happy,\r\nwith his great collection of entomological, botanical and ornithological\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nBut on the way the ship took fire, and the collection was either burned\r\nor ruined by soaking salt water.\r\n\r\nThat the crew and their sole passenger escaped alive was a wonder.\r\nWallace on reaching England was in a sorry plight, being destitute of\r\nclothes and funds.\r\n\r\nAnd there were unkind ones who did not hesitate to hint that he had only\r\nbeen over to Ireland working in a peat-bog, and that his knowledge of\r\nBrazil was gotten out of Humboldt's books.\r\n\r\nIn one way, Wallace surely paralleled Humboldt: both lost a most\r\nvaluable collection of natural-history specimens by shipwreck.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the good men who had advanced money now asked that it be\r\npaid. Wallace set to work writing out his recollections, the only asset\r\nthat he possessed.\r\n\r\nHis book, \"Travel on the Amazon and Rio Negro,\" had enough romance in it\r\nso that it floated. Royalties paid over in crisp Bank of England notes\r\nmade things look brighter. Another book was issued, called, \"Palm-Trees\r\nand Their Uses,\" and proved that the author was able to view a subject\r\nfrom every side, and say all that was to be said about it. \"Wallace on\r\nthe Palm\" is still a textbook.\r\n\r\nThe debts were paid, and Alfred Russel Wallace at thirty was square with\r\nthe world, the possessor of much valuable experience. He also had five\r\nhundred pounds in cash, with a reputation as a writer and traveler that\r\nno longer caused bookworms to sneeze.\r\n\r\nHaving paid off his obligations, he felt free again to leave England, a\r\nthing he had vowed he would not do, so long as his reputation was under\r\na cloud. This time he selected for a natural-history survey a section of\r\nthe world really less known than South America.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly in the year Eighteen Hundred Fifty-four, Alfred Russel Wallace\r\nreached Asia. He had decided that he would make the first and the best\r\ncollection of the flora and fauna of the Malay Archipelago that it was\r\npossible to make.\r\n\r\nWhite men had skirted the coast of many of the islands, but information\r\nas to what there was inland was mostly conjecture and guesswork.\r\n\r\nJust how long it would take Wallace to make his Malaysian\r\nnatural-history survey he did not know, but in a letter to Darwin he\r\nstated that he expected to be absent from England at least two years. He\r\nwas gone eight years, and during this time, walked, paddled or rode\r\nhorseback fifteen thousand miles, and visited many islands never before\r\ntrod by the foot of a white man.\r\n\r\nThe city of Singapore served him as a base or headquarters, because from\r\nthere he could catch trading-ships that plied among the islands of the\r\nArchipelago; and to Singapore he could also ship and there store his\r\nspecimens. From Singapore he made sixty separate voyages of discovery.\r\nIn all he sent home over one hundred twenty-five thousand\r\nnatural-history specimens, including about ten thousand birds, which,\r\nlater on, were all stuffed and mounted under his skilful direction.\r\n\r\nOn returning to England, Wallace took six years in preparation of his\r\nbook, \"The Malay Archipelago,\" a most stupendous literary undertaking,\r\nwhich covers the subjects of botany, geology, ornithology, entomology,\r\nzoology and anthropology, in a way that serves as a regular mine of\r\ninformation and suggestion for natural-history workers.\r\n\r\nThe book in its original form, I believe, sold for ten pounds (fifty\r\ndollars), and was issued to subscribers in parts. It was bought, not\r\nonly by students, but by a great number of general readers, there being\r\nenough adventure mixed up in the science to spice what otherwise might\r\nbe rather dry reading. For instance, there is a chapter about killing\r\norang-utans that must have served my old friend, Paul du Chaillu, as\r\nexcellent raw stock in compiling his own recollections.\r\n\r\nWallace states that the only foe for which the orang really has a hatred\r\nis the crocodile. It seems to share with man a shuddering fear of\r\nsnakes, although orangs have no part in making Kentucky famous. But the\r\ncrocodile is his natural and hereditary enemy. And as if to get even\r\nwith this ancient foe, who occasionally snaps off a young orang in his\r\nprime, the orangs will often locate a big crocodile, and jumping on his\r\nback beat him with clubs; and when he opens his gigantic mouth, the\r\nfemale orangs will fill the cavity with sticks and stones, and keep up\r\nthe fight until the crocodile succumbs and quits this vale of crocodile\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nThe orang is distinct and different from the chimpanzee and gorilla,\r\nwhich are found only in Western Africa.\r\n\r\nIn Borneo, the \"man-ape\" is quite numerous. This is the animal that has\r\ngiven rise to all those tales about \"the wild man of Borneo,\" which that\r\ngood man, P. T. Barnum, kept alive by exhibiting a fine specimen.\r\nBarnum's original \"wild man\" lived at Waltham, Massachusetts, and\r\nbelonged to the Baptist Church. He recently died worth a hundred\r\nthousand dollars, which money he left to found a school for young\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nThe orang, or mias, hides in the swampy jungles, and very rarely comes\r\nto the ground. The natives regard them as a sort of sacred object, and\r\nhave a great horror of killing them. Indeed, a person who kills a\r\nman-ape, they regard as a murderer; and so when Wallace announced to his\r\nattendants that he wanted to secure several specimens of these \"wild men\r\nof the woods,\" they cried, \"Alas! he is making a collection: it will be\r\nour turn next!\" And they fled in terror.\r\n\r\nWallace then hired another set of servants and resolved to make no\r\nconfidants, but just go ahead and find his game.\r\n\r\nHe had hunted for weeks through forest and jungle, but never a glimpse\r\nor sight of the man-ape! He had almost given up the search, and\r\nconcluded with several English scientists that this orang-utan was a\r\npart of that great fabric of pseudo-science invented by imaginative\r\nsailormen, who took most of their inland little journeys around the\r\ncapstan. And so musing, seated in the doorway of his bamboo house, he\r\nlooked out upon the forest, and there only a few yards away, swinging\r\nfrom tree to tree, was a man-ape. It seemed to him to be about five\r\ntimes as large as a man.\r\n\r\nHe seized his gun and approached; the beast stopped, glared, and railed\r\nat him in a voice of wrath. It broke off branches and threw sticks at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWallace thought of the offer made him by the South Kensington Museum:\r\n\"One hundred pounds in gold for an adult male, skin and skeleton to be\r\nproperly preserved and mounted; seventy-five pounds for a female.\"\r\n\r\nThe huge animal showed its teeth, cast one glance of scornful contempt\r\non the puny explorer, and started on, swinging thirty feet at a stretch\r\nand catching hold of the limbs with its two pairs of hands.\r\n\r\nWallace grasped his gun and followed, lured by the demoniac shape. A\r\nlittle of the superstition of the natives had gotten into his veins: he\r\ndare not kill the thing unless it came toward him, and he had to shoot\r\nit in self-defense.\r\n\r\nIt traveled in the trees about as fast as he could on the ground.\r\nOccasionally it would stop and chatter at him, throwing sticks in a most\r\nhuman way, as if to order him back.\r\n\r\nFinally, the instincts of the naturalist got the better of the man, and\r\nhe shot the animal. It came tumbling to the ground with a terrific\r\ncrash, grasping at the vines and leaves as it fell.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dead, but Wallace approached it with great caution. It\r\nproved to be a female, of moderate size, in height about three and a\r\nhalf feet, six feet across from finger to finger. Needless to say that\r\nWallace had to do the skinning and the mounting of the skeleton alone.\r\nHis servants had chills of fear if asked to approach it. The skeleton of\r\nthis particular orang can now be seen in the Derby Museum.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours after killing his first orang, Wallace heard a peculiar\r\ncrying in the forest, and on search found a young one, evidently the\r\nbaby of the one he had killed. The baby did not show any fear at all,\r\nevidently thinking it was with one of its kind, for it clung to him\r\npiteously, with an almost human tenderness.\r\n\r\nSays Wallace:\r\n\r\n\"When handled or nursed it was very quiet and contented, but when laid\r\ndown by itself would invariably cry; and for the first few nights was\r\nvery restless and noisy. I soon found it necessary to wash the little\r\nmias as well. After I had done so a few times it came to like the\r\noperation, and after rolling in the mud would begin crying, and continue\r\nuntil I took it out and carried it to the spout, when it immediately\r\nbecame quiet, although it would wince a little at the first rush of the\r\ncold water, and make ridiculously wry faces while the stream was running\r\nover its head. It enjoyed the wiping and rubbing dry amazingly, and when\r\nI brushed its hair seemed to be perfectly happy, lying quite still with\r\nits arms and legs stretched out. It was a never-failing amusement to\r\nobserve the curious changes of countenance by which it would express its\r\napproval or dislike of what was given to it. The poor little thing would\r\nlick its lips, draw in its cheeks, and turn up its eyes with an\r\nexpression of the most supreme satisfaction, when it had a mouthful\r\nparticularly to its taste. On the other hand, when its food was not\r\nsufficiently sweet or palatable, it would turn the mouthful about with\r\nits tongue for a moment, as if trying to extract what flavor there was,\r\nand then push it all out between its lips. If the same food was\r\ncontinued, it would proceed to scream and kick about violently, exactly\r\nlike a baby in a passion.\r\n\r\n\"When I had had it about a month it began to exhibit some signs of\r\nlearning to run alone. When laid upon the floor it would push itself\r\nalong by its legs, or roll itself over, and thus make an unwieldy\r\nprogression. When lying in the box it would lift itself up to the edge\r\nin an almost erect position, and once or twice succeeded in tumbling\r\nout. When left dirty or hungry, or otherwise neglected, it would scream\r\nviolently till attended to, varied by a kind of coughing noise, very\r\nsimilar to that which is made by the adult animal.\r\n\r\n\"If no one was in the house, or its cries were not attended to, it would\r\nbe quiet after a little while; but the moment it heard a footstep would\r\nbegin again, harder than ever. It was very human.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most lasting result of the wanderings of Alfred Russel Wallace\r\nconsists in his having established what is known to us as \"The Wallace\r\nLine.\" This line is a boundary that divides in a geographical way that\r\nportion of Malaysia which belongs to the continent of Asia from that\r\nwhich belongs to the continent of Australia.\r\n\r\nThe Wallace Line covers a distance of more than four thousand miles, and\r\nin this expanse there are three islands in which Great Britain could be\r\nset down without anywhere touching the sea.\r\n\r\nEven yet the knowledge of the average American or European is very hazy\r\nabout the size and extent of the Malay Archipelago, although through our\r\nmisunderstanding with Spain, which loaded us up with possessions we have\r\nno use for, we have recently gotten the geography down and dusted it off\r\na bit.\r\n\r\nThere is a book by Mrs. Rose Innes, wife of an English official in the\r\nFar East, who, among other entertaining things, tells of a head-hunter\r\nchief who taught her to speak Malay, and she, wishing to reciprocate,\r\noffered to teach him English; but the great man begged to be excused,\r\nsaying, \"Malay is spoken everywhere you go, east, west, north or south,\r\nbut in all the world there are only twelve people who speak English,\"\r\nand he proceeded to name them.\r\n\r\nOur assumptions are not quite so broad as this, but few of us realize\r\nthat the Protestant Christian Religion stands fifth in the number of\r\ncommunicants, as compared with the other great religions, and that\r\nagainst our hundred millions of people in America, the Malay Archipelago\r\nhas over two hundred millions.\r\n\r\nWallace found marked geological, botanical and zoological differences to\r\ndenote his line. And from these things he proved that there had been\r\ngreat changes, through subsidence and elevation of the land. At no very\r\nremote geologic period, Asia extended clear to Borneo, and also included\r\nthe Philippine Islands. This is shown by the fact that animal and\r\nvegetable life in all of these islands is almost identical with life on\r\nthe mainland: the same trees, the same flowers, the same birds, the same\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nAs you go westward, however, you come to islands which have a very\r\ndifferent flora and fauna, totally unlike that found in Asia, but very\r\nsimilar to that found in Australia.\r\n\r\nAustralia, be it known, is totally different in all its animal and\r\nvegetable phenomena from Asia.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, until the white man very recently carried them across,\r\nthere were no monkeys, apes, cats, bears, tigers, wolves, elephants,\r\nhorses, squirrels or rabbits. Instead there were found animals that are\r\nfound nowhere else, and which seem to belong to a different and\r\nso-called extinct geologic age, such as the kangaroo, wombats, the\r\nplatypus--which the sailors used to tell us was neither bird not beast,\r\nand yet was both. In birds, Australia has also very strange specimens,\r\nsuch as the ostrich which can not fly, but can outrun a horse and kills\r\nits prey by kicking forward like a man. Australia also has immense\r\nmound-making turkeys, honeysuckers and cockatoos, but no woodpeckers,\r\nquail or pheasants.\r\n\r\nWallace was the first to discover that there are various islands, some\r\nof them several hundred miles from Australia, where the animal life is\r\nidentical with that of Australia. And then there are islands, only a\r\ncomparatively few miles away, which have all the varieties of birds and\r\nbeasts found in Asia.\r\n\r\nBut this line that once separated continents is in places but fifteen\r\nmiles wide, and is always marked by a deep-water channel, but the seas\r\nthat separate Borneo and Sumatra from Asia, although wide, are so\r\nshallow that ships can find anchorage anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe Wallace Line, proving the subsidence of the sea and upheaval of the\r\nland, has never been seriously disputed, and is to many students the one\r\ngreat discovery by which Wallace will be remembered.\r\n\r\nWallace's book on \"The Geographical Distribution of Animals\" sets forth\r\nin a most interesting manner, the details of how he came to discover the\r\nLine.\r\n\r\nIt was in Eighteen Hundred Fifty-five that Wallace, alone in the wilds\r\nof the Malay Archipelago, became convinced of the scientific truth that\r\nspecies were an evolution from a common source, and he began making\r\nnotes of his observations along this particular line of thought. Some\r\nmonths afterward he wrote out his belief in the form of an essay, but\r\nthen he had no definite intention of what he would do with the paper,\r\nbeyond keeping it for future reference when he returned to England. In\r\nthe Fall of Eighteen Hundred Fifty-seven, however, he decided to send it\r\nto Darwin to be read before some scientific society, if Darwin\r\nconsidered it worthy. And this paper was read on the evening of July\r\nFirst, before the Linnæus Society, with one by Darwin on the same\r\nsubject, written before Wallace's paper arrived, wherein the identical\r\nviews are set forth. Darwin and Wallace expressed what many other\r\ninvestigators had guessed or but dimly perceived.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the six immortal modern scientists, three began life working as\r\nsurveyors and civil engineers--Wallace, Tyndall, Spencer. From the\r\nnumber of eminent men, not forgetting Henry Thoreau, Leonardo da Vinci,\r\nLincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Washington--aye! nor old John Brown, who\r\ncarried a Gunter's chain and manipulated the transit--we come to the\r\nconclusion that there must be something in the business of surveying\r\nthat conduces to clear thinking and strong, independent action.\r\n\r\nIf I had a boy who by nature and habit was given to futilities, I would\r\napprentice him to a civil engineer.\r\n\r\nWhen two gangs of men begin a tunnel, working toward each other from\r\ndifferent sides of a mountain, dreams, poetry, hypothesis and guesswork\r\nhad better be omitted from the equation. Here is a case where\r\nmetaphysics has no bearing. It is a condition that confronts them, not a\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nTheological explanations are assumptions built upon hypotheses, and your\r\ntheologian always insists that you shall be dead before you can know.\r\n\r\nIf a bridge breaks down or a fireproof building burns to ashes, no\r\nexplanation on the part of the architect can explain away the\r\nmiscalculation; but your theologian always evolves his own fog, into\r\nwhich he can withdraw at will, thus making escape easy. Darwin, Huxley,\r\nSpencer, Tyndall and Wallace all had the mathematical mind. Nothing but\r\nthe truth would satisfy them. In school, you remember how we sometimes\r\nused to work on a mathematical problem for hours or days. Many would\r\ngive it up. A few of the class would take the answer from the book, and\r\nin an extremity force the figures to give the proper result. Such\r\nstudents, it is needless to say, never gained the respect of either\r\nclass or teacher--or themselves. They had the true theological instinct.\r\nBut a few kept on until the problem was solved, or the fallacy of it had\r\nbeen discovered. In life's school such were the men just named, and the\r\ndistinguishing feature of their lives was that they were students and\r\nlearners to the last.\r\n\r\nOf this group of scientific workers, Alfred Russel Wallace alone\r\nsurvives, aged eighty-nine at this writing, still studying, earnestly\r\nintent upon one of Nature's secrets that four of his great colleagues\r\nyears ago labeled \"Unknown,\" and the other two marked \"Unknowable.\"\r\n\r\nTo some it is an anomaly and contradiction that a lover of science,\r\nexact, cautious, intent on certitude, should accept a belief in personal\r\nimmortality. Still, to others this is regarded as positive proof of his\r\nsuperior insight.\r\n\r\nAll thinking men agree that we are surrounded by phenomena that to a\r\ngreat extent are unanalyzed; but Herbert Spencer, for one, thought it a\r\nlapse in judgment to attribute to spirit intervention, mysteries which\r\ncould not be accounted for on any other grounds. It was equal to that\r\nsin against science which Darwin committed, and which he atoned for in\r\ncontrite public confession, when he said: \"It surely must be this,\r\notherwise what is it? Hence we assume,\" and so on. Some recent writers\r\nhave sought to demolish Wallace's argument concerning Spiritism by\r\nsaying he is an old man and in his dotage. Wallace once wrote a booklet\r\nentitled, \"Vaccination a Fallacy,\" which created a big dust in Doctors'\r\nRow, and was cited as corroborative proof, along with his faith in\r\nSpiritism, that the man was mentally incompetent.\r\n\r\nBut this is a deal worse excuse for argument than anything Wallace ever\r\nput forth. The real fact is that Wallace issued a book on Spiritism in\r\nEighteen Hundred Seventy-four, and in Eighteen Hundred Ninety-six\r\nreissued it with numerous amendments, confirming his first conclusions.\r\nSo he has held his peculiar views on immortality for over thirty years,\r\nand moreover his mental vigor is still unimpaired.\r\n\r\nWhether the proof he has received as to the existence of disembodied\r\nspirits is sufficient for others is very uncertain; but if it suffices\r\nfor himself, it is not for us to quibble. Wallace agrees to allow us to\r\nhave our opinions if we will let him have his.\r\n\r\nHis views are in no sense those of Christianity; rather, they might be\r\ncalled those of Theosophy, as the personal God and the dogma of\r\nsalvation and atonement are entirely omitted.\r\n\r\nThe Doctrine of Evolution he carries into the realm of spirit. His\r\nbelief is that souls reincarnate themselves many times for the ultimate\r\nobject of experience, growth and development. He holds that this life is\r\nthe gateway to another, but that we should live each day as though it\r\nwere our last.\r\n\r\nTo this effect we find, in a recent article, Wallace quotes a little\r\nstory from Tolstoy: A priest, seeing a peasant in a field plowing,\r\napproached him and asked, \"How would you spend the rest of this day if\r\nyou knew you were to die tonight?\"\r\n\r\nThe priest expected the man, who was a bit irregular in his churchgoing,\r\nto say, \"I would spend my last hours in confession and prayer.\" But the\r\npeasant replied, \"How would I spend the rest of the day if I were to die\r\ntonight?--why, I'd plow!\"\r\n\r\nHence, Wallace holds that it is better to plow than to pray, and that in\r\nfact, when rightly understood, good plowing is prayer.\r\n\r\nAll useful effort is sacred, and nothing else is or ever can be. Wallace\r\nbelieves that the only fit preparation for the future lies in improving\r\nthe present. Please pass the dotage!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN FISKE]\r\n\r\nJOHN FISKE\r\n\r\n\r\n     In a sinless and painless world the moral element would be lacking;\r\n     the goodness would have no more significance in our conscious life\r\n     than that load of atmosphere which we are always carrying about\r\n     with us.\r\n\r\n     We are thus brought to a striking conclusion, the essential\r\n     soundness of which can not be gainsaid. In a happy world there must\r\n     be pain and sorrow, and in a moral world the knowledge of evil is\r\n     indispensable. The stern necessity for this has been proved to\r\n     inhere in the innermost constitution of the human soul. It is part\r\n     and parcel of the universe.\r\n\r\n     We do not find that evil has been interpolated into the universe\r\n     from without; we find that, on the contrary, it is an indispensable\r\n     part of the dramatic whole. God is the creator of evil, and from\r\n     the eternal scheme of things diabolism is forever excluded.\r\n\r\n     From our present standpoint we may fairly ask, what would have been\r\n     the worth of that primitive innocence portrayed in the myth of the\r\n     Garden of Eden, had it ever been realized in the life of men? What\r\n     would have been the moral value or significance of a race of human\r\n     beings ignorant of sin, and doing beneficent acts with no more\r\n     consciousness or volition than the deftly contrived machine that\r\n     picks up raw material at one end, and turns out some finished\r\n     product at the other? Clearly, for strong and resolute men and\r\n     women, an Eden would be but a fool's paradise.\r\n\r\n     \"_Through Nature to God_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN FISKE\r\n\r\nEarly in life John Fiske aimed high and thought himself capable of\r\ngreat things. He also believed that the world accepted a man at the\r\nestimate he placed upon himself.\r\n\r\nFiske was born at Hartford in Eighteen Hundred Forty-two. His mother's\r\nmaiden name was Fiske and his father's name was Green, and until\r\nwell-nigh manhood, John Fiske was called Edmund Green.\r\n\r\nHis father died while Edmund was a baby, and the wee youngster was taken\r\ncharge of by his grandmother Fiske of Middletown, Connecticut.\r\n\r\nWhen his mother married again, Edmund did not approve of the match.\r\nParents often try to live their children's lives for them, and to hold\r\nthe balance true, children occasionally attempt to dictate to parents in\r\naffairs of the heart. A young man by the name of Hamlet will be recalled\r\nwho, having no special business of his own, became much distressed and\r\nhad theories concerning the conduct of his mother. As a general\r\nproposition the person who looks after the territory directly under his\r\nown hat will find his time fairly well employed.\r\n\r\nThey say Edmund Green made threats when his mother changed her name, but\r\nall he did was to follow her example and change his. Thereafter he was\r\nplain John Fiske. \"I must have a name easy to take hold of: one that\r\npeople can remember,\" he said. And they do say that John Fiske's\r\nreverence for John Ruskin had something to do with his choice of name.\r\n\r\nJust here some curious one of the curious sex, which by the way holds no\r\nmonopoly on curiosity, may ask if the second venture of Mrs. Green was\r\nfruitful and fortunate. So I will say, yes, eminently so; and in one way\r\nit seemed to serve, for John Fiske's stepfather waived John's\r\ndispleasure with his stepfather's wife, and did something toward sending\r\nthe young man to Harvard University, and also supplied the funds to send\r\nhim on a tour around the world.\r\n\r\nHowever, the second brood revealed no genius, at sight of which the\r\ndefunct Mr. Green from his seat in Elysium must have chortled in glee,\r\nassuming, of course, that disembodied spirits are cognizant of the\r\ndoings of their late partners, as John Fiske seemed to think they were.\r\n\r\nIf Alexander Humboldt's mother had not married again, we would have had\r\nno Alexander Humboldt. Second marriages are like first ones in this:\r\nSometimes they are happy and sometimes not. In any event, I occasionally\r\nthink that mother-love has often been much exaggerated. Love is a most\r\nbeautiful thing, and it does not seem to make very much difference who\r\nsupplies it. Stepmother-love, Lincoln used to say, was the most precious\r\nthing that had ever come his way. I know a man who loves his\r\nmother-in-law, because she pitied him. Our Oneida friends had\r\n\"Community Mothers,\" who took care of everybody's babies, just as if\r\nthey were their own, and with marked success, for the genus hoodlum\r\nnever evolved at Oneida. Grandmother-love served all purposes for little\r\nIsaac Newton, just as it did for John Fiske.\r\n\r\nJohn Fiske's grandmother was his first teacher, and she started out with\r\nthe assumption that genius always skips one generation. She believed\r\nthat she was dealing with a record-breaker, and she was. What she did\r\nnot know about the classics was known by others whom she delegated to\r\nteach her grandchild.\r\n\r\nWhen her baby genius was just out of linsey-woolsey dresses and wore\r\ntrousers buttoned to a calico waist, she began preparing him for\r\ncollege. The old lady had loved a college man in her youth, and she\r\njudged Harvard by the Harvard man she knew best. And the Harvard man she\r\nsaw in her waking dreams, she created in her own image. Harvard requires\r\nperspective, and viewed over the years through a mist of melancholy it\r\nis very beautiful. At close range we often get a Jarrett Bumball flavor\r\nof cigarettes and a sight of the foam that made Milwaukee famous. To a\r\ngreat degree, Gran'ma Fiske created her Harvard out of the stuff that\r\ndreams are made of. When her little charge was six years old, she began\r\npreparing him for Harvard by teaching him to say, \"amo, amas, amat.\"\r\n\r\nAt seven years of age he was reading Cæsar's \"Commentaries\" and making\r\nwise comments over his bowl of bread-and-milk about the Tenth Legion;\r\nand he also had his opinions concerning the relationship of Cæsar with\r\nCleopatra. At this time he read Josephus for rest, and discovered for\r\nhimself that the famous passage about Jesus of Nazareth was an\r\ninterpolation.\r\n\r\nWhen he was eight, he was familiar with Plato, had read all of\r\nShakespeare's plays, and propounded a few hypotheses concerning the\r\nauthorship of the \"Sonnets.\"\r\n\r\nAt nine he spoke Greek with an Attic accent. When ten he had read\r\nPrescott, Gibbon and Macaulay; and about this time, as a memory test he\r\nwrote a history of the world from the time of Moses down to the date of\r\nhis own birth, giving a list of the greatest men who had ever lived,\r\nwith a brief mention of what they had done, with the date of their birth\r\nand death.\r\n\r\nThis book is still in existence and so far as I know has never been\r\nequaled by the performance of any infant prodigy, save possibly John\r\nStuart Mill.\r\n\r\nWhen twelve years of age he had read Vergil, Sallust, Tacitus, Ovid,\r\nJuvenal and Catullus. He had also mastered trigonometry, surveying,\r\nnavigation, geometry and differential calculus.\r\n\r\nBefore his grandmother had him discard knee-breeches, he kept his diary\r\nin Spanish, spoke German at the table, and read German philosophy in the\r\noriginal. The year he was sixteen he wrote poems after Dante in Italian\r\nand translated Cervantes into English.\r\n\r\nAt seventeen he read the Hebrew scriptures like a Rabbi, and was\r\nfamiliar with Sanskrit.\r\n\r\nNow, let no carpist imagine I have dealt in hyperbole, or hand-illumined\r\nthe facts: I have merely stated some simple truths about the early\r\ncareer of John Fiske.\r\n\r\nOne might imagine that with all his wonderful achievements this youth\r\nwould be top-heavy and a most insufferable prig. The fact was, he was a\r\nfine, rollicking, healthy young man much given to pranks, and withal\r\ngenerous and lovable.\r\n\r\nHe was admitted to Harvard without examination, for his fame had\r\npreceded him. Students and professors alike looked at him in wonder.\r\n\r\nAt Cambridge, as if to keep good his record, he studied thirteen hours a\r\nday, for twelve months in the year. He ranged through every subject in\r\nthe catalog, and all recorded knowledge was to him familiar.\r\n\r\nProphecies were freely made that he would eclipse Sir Isaac Newton and\r\nHumboldt. But there were others who had a clearer vision.\r\n\r\nJohn Fiske made a decided success in life and left his personality\r\ndistinctly impressed upon his time, but it is no disparagement to say of\r\nhim that Autumn did not fulfil the promise of Spring. And Fiske himself\r\nin his single original contribution to the evolution crusade explains\r\nthe reason why.\r\n\r\nProfessor Santayanna of Harvard once said that John Fiske made three\r\ngreat scientific discoveries, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. As you lengthen a pigeon's bill, you increase the size of its feet.\r\n\r\n2. White tomcats with blue eyes are always deaf.\r\n\r\n3. The extent of mental development in any animal is in proportion to\r\nits infancy or the length of time involved in its reaching physical\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nWaiving Numbers One and Two as of doubtful value, Number Three is\r\nFiske's sole original discovery, according to his confession. Further,\r\nHuxley quotes Fiske on this theme, and adds, \"The delay of adolescence\r\nand the prolonging of the period of infancy form a subject, as expressed\r\nby Mr. Fiske, which is worthy of our most careful consideration.\"\r\n\r\nRareripes fall early. John Fiske's name was coupled, as we have seen,\r\nwith those of Newton and Humboldt. Newton died at eighty-six, Humboldt\r\nat ninety. These men developed slowly: the hothouse methods were not for\r\nthem. Fiske at twenty knew more than any of them did at forty. Fiske at\r\ntwenty-five was a better man mentally and physically than he was at\r\nthirty-five. At forty he was refused life-insurance because his\r\nmeasurement east and west was out of proportion to his measurement north\r\nand south.\r\n\r\nHe used often to sit at his desk for fifteen hours a day, writing and\r\nstudying. The sedentary habit grew upon him; the vital organs got\r\nclogged with adipose tissue. The doctor told him that \"his diaphragm was\r\ntoo close to his lungs\"--a cheerful proposition, well worthy of a\r\nsmall, mouse-colored medicus who dare not run the risk of displeasing a\r\nbig patient by telling him the truth, that is, that deep breathing and\r\nactive exercise in the open air can never be replaced through the use of\r\nsomething poured out of a bottle.\r\n\r\nPeople who eat too much, drink too much, smoke too much, and do not\r\nexercise enough, have to pay for their privileges, even though they are\r\nable to work differential calculus with one hand and recite Xenophon's\r\n\"Anabasis\" backward. They all have the liver and lungs too close to the\r\ndiaphragm, because that damnable invention of Sir Isaac Newton's\r\nslumbers not nor sleeps, and all the vital organs droop and drop when we\r\nneglect deep breathing. Inertia is a vice. The gods cultivate\r\nlevitation, which is a different thing from levity, meaning skyey\r\ngravitation, uplift, aspiration expressed in bodily attitude. When\r\nlevitation lets go, gravity doubles its grip.\r\n\r\nThe Yogi of the East know vastly more about this theme than we do, and\r\nhave made of deep breathing an art. Carry the crown of your head high,\r\nhold your chin in, and fill the top of your lungs by cultivating\r\nlevitation. We are gods in the biscuit!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter four years at Harvard and the regulation two years at the Harvard\r\nLaw School, John Fiske opened an office in Boston and gave his shingle\r\nto the breeze. No clients came, and this was well--for the clients.\r\nAlso, for John. The law is a business proposition: its essence is the\r\nadjustment of differences between men, the lubrication of exchange,\r\ngetting things on! Learned men very seldom make good lawyers. Law is a\r\nvery practical matter, and as for \"Law Latin,\" it can be learned in a\r\nweek and then should be mostly forgotten. The lawyer who asks his client\r\nabout the \"causa sine qua non,\" or harangues the jury concerning the\r\n\"ipse dixit\" of \"de facto\" and \"de jure,\" will probably be mulcted for\r\ncosts on general principles.\r\n\r\n\"I always rule hard against the lawyer who quotes Latin,\" said a\r\nBrooklyn judge to me the other day. Happily, Law Latin is now not used\r\nto any extent, except in Missouri.\r\n\r\nNo more clients came to John Fiske than did to Wendell Phillips, who\r\nonce had a law-office on the same street. So John sent letters to the\r\nnewspapers, wrote book-reviews, and contributed essays to the \"Atlantic\r\nMonthly.\" Occasionally, he would lecture for scientific clubs or\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nWhile still in the Law School he had discounted the future and married a\r\ncharming young woman, who believed in him to an extent that would have\r\nmade the average man pause.\r\n\r\nMarriages do not always keep pace exactly with the price of corn.\r\n\r\nReceipts in the Fiske law-office were not active. John Fiske was\r\ntwenty-six; his grandmother was dead, and family cares were coming along\r\napace, all according to the Law of Malthus.\r\n\r\nHe accepted an offer to give substitute lectures at Harvard on history,\r\nfor a professor who had gone abroad for his health. This he continued,\r\nspeaking for any absentee on any subject, and tutoring rich laggards for\r\na consideration. Good boys, low on phosphorus, used to get him to start\r\ntheir daily themes, and those overtaken in the throes of trigonometry he\r\noften rescued from disgrace.\r\n\r\nDarwinism was in the saddle. Asa Gray was mildly defending it. Agassiz\r\nstood aloof, clinging to his early Swiss parsonage teachings, and the\r\nTheological Department marched in solid phalanx and scoffed and scorned.\r\nYale, always having more theology than Harvard, threw out challenges.\r\nFiske had saturated himself with the ideas of Darwin and Wallace, and\r\nhis intellect was great enough to perceive the vast and magnificent\r\nscope of \"The Origin of Species.\" He prepared and read a lecture on the\r\nsubject, all couched in gentle and judicial phrase, but with a finale\r\nthat gave forth no uncertain sound.\r\n\r\nThe Overseers decided to ask Fiske to amplify the subject and give a\r\ncourse of lectures on the Law of Evolution.\r\n\r\nThe subject grew under his hands and the course extended itself into\r\nthirty-five lectures, covering the whole field of natural history, with\r\nmany short excursions into the realms of biology, embryology, botany,\r\ngeology and cosmogony.\r\n\r\nFiske was made assistant librarian at a salary of one thousand dollars a\r\nyear. It was not much money, but it gave him a fixed position, with time\r\nto help the erring freshman and the mentally recalcitrant sophomore\r\nhandicapped by rich parents. For seven years Fiske held this position of\r\nassistant librarian, and hardly a student at Harvard during those years\r\nbut acknowledged the personal help he received at the hands of John\r\nFiske. Knowledge consists in having an assistant librarian who knows\r\nwhere to find the thing.\r\n\r\nFiske's thirty-five lectures had evolved into that excellent book,\r\n\"Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy.\" The public were buying it.\r\n\r\nEvolution was fast taking its place as a fixed fact. And John Fiske was\r\nmoving into public favor on the flood-tide. There were demands for his\r\nlectures from various schools, colleges and lyceums, throughout the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nHe resigned his position so as to give all his time to writing and\r\nspeaking. And Harvard, proud of her gifted son, elected him an Overseer\r\nof the University, which position he held until his death. John Fiske\r\ndied in Nineteen Hundred One, suddenly, aged fifty-nine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Next to the originator of a great thought is the man who quotes it,\"\r\nsays Ralph Waldo Emerson. Next to the discoverer of a great scientific\r\ntruth is the man who recognizes and upholds it. The service done science\r\nby Fiske is beyond calculation. Fiske was not a Columbus upon the sea of\r\nscience: he followed the course laid out by others, and was really never\r\nout of sight of a buoy. He comes as near being a great scientist,\r\nperhaps, as any man that America has ever produced.\r\n\r\nAmerica has had but four men of unmistakable originality. These are:\r\nFranklin, Emerson, Whitman and Edison. Each worked in a field\r\nparticularly his own, and the genius of each was recognized in Europe\r\nbefore we were willing to acknowledge it here. But the word \"scientist\"\r\ncan hardly be properly applied to any of these men. For want of a better\r\nname we call John Fiske our greatest scientist. He was the most learned\r\nman of his day. In the realm of Physical Geography no American could\r\napproach him. The combined knowledge of everybody else was his: he had a\r\npassion for facts, a memory like a daybook, and his systematic mind was\r\ndisciplined until it was a regular Dewey card-index.\r\n\r\nLouis Agassiz was born in Europe, but he was ours by adoption, and he\r\nmight dispute with Fiske the title to first place in the American\r\nPantheon of Science, were it not for the fact that the Law of Evolution\r\nwas beyond his ken, being obscured by a marked, myopic, theological,\r\nstigmatic squint.\r\n\r\nAgassiz died in his sins, unconvinced unrepentant, refusing the rite of\r\nextreme unction that Asa Gray offered him, his sensitive spirit writhing\r\nat mention of the word \"Darwin.\" On his tomb, Clio with moving finger\r\nhas carved one of his own sentences, nor all your tears shall blot a\r\nline of it. And these are the words of Agassiz: \"Darwinism seeks to\r\ndethrone God, and replace Him by a blind force called the Law of\r\nEvolution.\" So passed away the great soul of Louis Agassiz.\r\n\r\nFiske has been called the Huxley of America; but Fiske was like Agassiz\r\nin this, he never had the felicity to achieve the ill-will of the many.\r\nFiske has also been called the Drummond of America, but Fiske was really\r\na Henry Drummond and a Louis Agassiz rolled into one, the mass well\r\nseasoned with essence of Huxley. John Fiske made the science of Darwin\r\nand Wallace palatable to orthodox theology, and it is to the earnest and\r\neloquent words of Fiske that we owe it that Evolution is taught\r\neverywhere in the public schools and even in the sectarian colleges of\r\nAmerica today.\r\n\r\nThe almost universal opposition to Darwin's book arose from the idea\r\nthat its acceptance would destroy the Christian religion. This was the\r\nplaintive plea put forth when Newton advanced his discovery of the Law\r\nof Gravitation, and also when Copernicus proclaimed the movements of the\r\nearth: these things were contrary to the Bible! Copernicus was a loyal\r\nCatholic; Sir Isaac Newton was a staunch Churchman; but both kept their\r\nreligion in water-tight compartments, so that it never got mixed with\r\ntheir science. Gladstone never allowed his religion to tint his\r\nstatesmanship, and we all know businessmen who follow the double-entry\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nThat famous French toast, \"Here's to our wives and sweethearts--may they\r\nnever meet!\" would suit most lawyers just as well if expressed this way.\r\n\"Here's to our religion and our business--God knows they never meet.\"\r\n\r\nTo Sir Isaac Newton, religion was something to be believed, not\r\nunderstood. He left religion to the specialists, recognizing its value\r\nas a sort of police protection for the State, and as his share in the\r\nmatter he paid tithes, and attended prayers as a matter of patriotic\r\nduty and habit.\r\n\r\nVoltaire recognized the greatness of Newton's intellect, but he could\r\nnot restrain his aqua fortis, and so he said this: \"All the scientists\r\nwere jealous of Newton when he discovered the Law of Gravitation, but\r\nthey got even with him when he wrote his book on the Hebrew Prophecies!\"\r\nNewton wrote that book in his water-tight compartment.\r\n\r\nBut Newton was no hypocrite. The attitude of the Primrose Sphinx who\r\nbowed his head in the Church of England Chapel--the Jew who rose to the\r\nhighest office Christian England had to offer--and repeated Ben Ezra's\r\nprayer, was not the attitude of Newton. Darwin waived religion, and if\r\nhe ever heard of the Bible no one knew it from his writings.\r\n\r\nHuxley danced on it. Tyndall and Spencer regarded the Bible as a\r\nvaluable and more or less interesting collection of myths, fables and\r\nfolklore tales. Wallace sees in it a strain of prophetic truth and\r\nregards it as gold-bearing quartz of a low grade.\r\n\r\nFiske regarded it as the word of God, Holy Writ, expressed often\r\nvaguely, mystically, and in the language of poetry and symbol, but true\r\nwhen rightly understood.\r\n\r\nAnd so John Fiske throughout his life spoke in orthodox pulpits to the\r\ngreat delight of Christian people, and at the same time wrote books on\r\nscience and dedicated them to Thomas Huxley, Bishop of all Agnostics.\r\n\r\nTo the scientist the word \"supernatural\" is a contradiction. Everything\r\nthat is in the Universe is natural; the supernatural is the natural not\r\nyet understood. And that which is called the supernatural is often the\r\nfigment of a disordered, undisciplined or undeveloped imagination.\r\n\r\nSimple people think of imagination as that quality of mind which revels\r\nin tales of fairies and hobgoblins, but imagination of this character is\r\nundisciplined and undeveloped. The scientist who deals with the sternest\r\nof facts must be highly imaginative, or his work is vain. The engineer\r\nsees his structure complete, ere he draws his plans. So the scientist\r\ndivines the thing first and then looks for it until he finds it. Were\r\nthis not so, he would not be able to recognize things hitherto unknown,\r\nwhen he saw them; nor could he fit fact to fact, like bones in a\r\nskeleton, and build a complete structure, if it all did not first exist\r\nas a thought.\r\n\r\nTo reprove and punish children for flights of imagination, John Fiske\r\nargued, was one of the things done only by a barbaric people.\r\n\r\nChildren first play at the thing, which later they are to do well. Play\r\nis preparation. The man of imagination is the man of sympathy, and only\r\nsuch are those who benefit and bless mankind and help us on our way.\r\n\r\nJohn Fiske had imagination enough to follow closely and hold fellowship\r\nwith the greatest minds the world has ever known. John Fiske believed\r\nthat we live in a natural universe, and that God works through Nature,\r\nand that, in fact, Nature is the spirit of God at work.\r\n\r\nDoubts never disturbed John Fiske. Things that were not true technically\r\nand literally were true to him if taken in a spiritual or poetic way.\r\nGod, to him, was a personal being, creating through the Law of Evolution\r\nbecause He chose to. The six days of Creation were six eons or\r\ngeological periods.\r\n\r\nNo man has ever been more in sympathy with the discoverers in Natural\r\nHistory than John Fiske. No man ever knew so much about his work as John\r\nFiske. His knowledge was colossal, his memory prodigious. And in all of\r\nthe realm of science and philosophy, from microscopy and the germ\r\ntheory to advanced astronomy and the birth of worlds, his glowing\r\nimagination saw the work of a beneficent Creator who stood above and\r\nbeyond and outside of Natural Law, and with Infinite Wisdom and Power\r\ndid His own Divine Will.\r\n\r\nLittle theologians who feared Science, on account of danger to pet\r\ntexts, received from him kindly pats on the head, as he showed them how\r\nboth Science and Scripture were true.\r\n\r\nHe didn't do away with texts, he merely changed their interpretation.\r\nAnd often he discovered that the text which seemed to contradict science\r\nwas really prophetic of it. John Fiske did not take anything away from\r\nanybody, unless he gave them something better in return.\r\n\r\n\"A man's belief is a part of the man,\" he said. \"Take it away by force\r\nand he will bleed to death; but if the time comes when he no longer\r\nneeds it, he will either slough it or convert it into something more\r\nuseful.\"\r\n\r\nEvery good thing begins as something else. Evolution is at work on the\r\ncreeds as well as in matter. A monkey-man will have a monkey belief.\r\n\r\nHe evolves the thing he needs, and the belief that fits one man will not\r\nfit another. Religious opinions are never thrown away: they evolve into\r\nsomething else, and we use the old symbols and imagery to express new\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nJohn Fiske, unlike John Morley, considered \"Compromise\" a great thing.\r\n\"Truth is a point of view: let us get together,\" he used to say. And so\r\nhe worked to keep the old, as a foundation for the new.\r\n\r\nI once heard him interrupted in a lecture by a questioner who asked,\r\n\"Why would you keep the Church intact?\" The question stung him into\r\nimpassioned speech which was better than anything in his manuscript. I\r\ncan not attempt to reproduce his exact language; but the intent was that\r\nas the Church was the chief instrument in preserving for us the learning\r\nof Greece and Rome, so has she been the mother of art, the inspirer of\r\nmusic and the protector of the outcast. Colleges, hospitals, libraries,\r\nart-galleries and asylums, all come to us through the medium of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThe convent was first a place of protection for oppressed womanhood.\r\n\r\nTo discard religion would be like repudiating our parents because we did\r\nnot like their manners and clothes. The religious impulse is the art\r\nimpulse, and both are manifestations of love, and love is the basis of\r\nour sense of sublimity.\r\n\r\nWe surely will abandon certain phases of religion. We will purify,\r\nrefine and beautify our religion, just as we have our table etiquette\r\nand our housekeeping. The millennium will come only through the\r\nscientific acceptance of piety. When Church and State separated it was\r\nwell, but when Science and Religion joined hands it was better. Science\r\nstands for the head; Religion for the heart. All things are dual, and\r\nthrough the marriage of these two principles, one the masculine and the\r\nother the feminine, will come a renaissance of advancement such as this\r\ntired old world on her zigzag journeys has never seen. Sociology is the\r\nreligious application of economics. Demonology has been replaced by\r\npsychology, and the betterment of man's condition on earth is now fast\r\nbecoming the chief solicitude of the Church.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that John Fiske's hope for the future was bright\r\nand strong. The man was an optimist by nature, and his patience and\r\ngood-nature were always in evidence. He made friends, and he held them.\r\nHuxley, who of all men hated piety that was flavored with hypocrisy,\r\nloved John Fiske and once wrote this: \"There was a man sent from God by\r\nthe name of John Fiske. Now John holds in his great and generous heart\r\nthe best of all the Church has to offer; hence I no longer go to\r\nprayers, but instead, I invite John Fiske to come and dine with us every\r\nSunday, so are we made better--Amen.\"\r\n\r\n     SO HERE ENDETH \"LITTLE JOURNEYS TO THE HOMES OF GREAT SCIENTISTS,\"\r\n     BEING VOLUME TWELVE OF THE SERIES, AS WRITTEN BY ELBERT HUBBARD:\r\n     EDITED AND ARRANGED BY FRED BANN; BORDERS AND INITIALS BY ROYCROFT\r\n     ARTISTS, AND PRODUCED BY THE ROYCROFTERS, AT THEIR SHOPS, WHICH ARE\r\n     IN EAST AURORA, ERIE COUNTY, NEW YORK, MCMXXII",
