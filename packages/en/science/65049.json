The origin of a new individual by\r\nbudding seems often, indeed, to proceed from any set of somatic cells\r\nin the mother animal; but somatic cells, if they contain solely the\r\ndeterminants controlling themselves, cannot possibly give rise to a\r\ncomplete new individual, since this presupposes the presence of _all_\r\nthe determinants of the species. But as these determinants cannot be\r\nformed _de novo_, the budding cells must contain in addition to the\r\nusual controlling somatic determinants, idioplasm in a latent, inactive\r\nstate, which only becomes active under certain internal or external\r\ninfluences, and then gives rise to the formation of a bud. The source\r\nof this accessory idioplasm must, however, be looked for only in the\r\negg-cell.\r\n\r\nIn plants this bud-idioplasm must be complete germ-plasm, because\r\nthe budding starts only from one kind of cell, the cambium-cells;\r\nbut in animals in which--as it seems--it always proceeds from at\r\nleast two different kinds of cells--those of the ectoderm and those\r\nof the endoderm--the matter is more complex. In this case these two\r\nkinds of cells will contain as bud-idioplasm two different groups of\r\ndeterminants, which mutually complete each other and form perfect\r\ngerm-plasm, and only the co-operation of these two sets will give rise\r\nto the formation of a bud. I will not, however, go further into detail\r\nin regard to these relations, for the theory can do nothing more here\r\nthan formulate what has been observed; it is hardly in a position to\r\nhelp us to a better understanding of the facts.\r\n\r\nThe case is not much clearer in regard to the processes which lead to\r\nthe replacing of lost parts. The manifold phenomena of regeneration\r\ncan also be brought into harmony with the theory, if we attribute to\r\nthose cells from which the replacing or entire reconstruction of the\r\nlost part arises an 'accessory-idioplasm,' which, at least, contains\r\nthe determinants indispensable to the building up of the part. It is\r\npossible that the assumed accessory idioplasm frequently contains\r\na much larger complex of determinants, and that it depends on the\r\nliberating stimuli which, and how many of these, will become active.\r\n\r\nIf we take a survey of regenerative phenomena in the animal kingdom,\r\nit strikes us at once that the capacity is very different in different\r\nspecies, extraordinarily great in some and very slight in others.\r\nIn general it is greater in lower animals than in higher, but,\r\nnevertheless, the degree of differentiation cannot be the only factor\r\nthat determines the capacity for regeneration. That unicellular\r\norganisms can completely replace lost parts, that even a piece of an\r\ninfusorian can reconstruct the whole animal if only the piece contain\r\na part of the nucleus, we have already seen when discussing the\r\nsignificance of the nuclear substance. In this case the nucleus must\r\ncontain the complete germ-plasm, that is, the collective determinants\r\nof the species, and these induce the reconstruction of the lost part,\r\nthough they do so in a way that is still entirely obscure to us. In the\r\nmeantime, our interpretation will not carry us further, either here or\r\nin regard to any other order of vital phenomena. To go further would be\r\nlittle short of propounding a causal theory of life itself; it would\r\nmean having a complete and real 'explanation' of what 'life' is. As yet\r\nno one has been able to claim this position. We can see the different\r\nstages through which every organism passes, and that they arise one\r\nout of the other; we can even penetrate down to the succession of those\r\ndelicate and marvellously complex processes which effect nuclear and\r\ncell-division; but we are still far from being able to deduce, except\r\nquite empirically, from the present state of a cell what the succeeding\r\none will be, that is, from being able to understand the succession of\r\nevents as a necessary nexus which could be predicted. How a biophor\r\ncomes to develop from itself the phenomena of life is quite unknown to\r\nus; we know neither the interaction of the ultimate material particles\r\nnor the forces which bring it about; we cannot tell what moves the\r\nhordes of different kinds of biophors to range themselves together in\r\na particular order, what molecular displacements and variations arise\r\nfrom this, or what influence the external world has, and so forth.\r\nWe see only the visible outcome of an endless number of invisible\r\nmovements--growth, division, multiplication, reconstruction, and\r\ndifferentiation.\r\n\r\nAs long as we are so far from an understanding of life no theory of\r\nregeneration can be anything more than a 'portmanteau theory,' as\r\nDelage once expressed himself in relation to the whole theory of\r\ninheritance, a theory which is like a portmanteau in that one can\r\nonly take out of it what has previously been put in. If we wish to\r\nexplain the renewal of the aboral band of cilia in a Stentor, we\r\nfirst pack our trunk, in this case the nucleus of the Infusorian,\r\nwith the determinants of the ciliated region, and then think of these\r\nas being liberated by the stimulus of wounding, and being brought to\r\nand arranged in the proper place by unknown forces to reconstruct the\r\nciliary region in some unknown way. No one could be more clearly aware\r\nthan I am that this is not an exhaustive causal explanation of the\r\nprocess itself. Nevertheless, it is not quite without value, inasmuch\r\nas it allows us at least to bring the facts together in rational\r\norder--in this case the dependence of the faculty of regeneration on\r\nthe presence of nuclear substance--under a formula which we can use\r\nprovisionally, that is, with which we can raise new questions. As soon\r\nas we ascend higher in the series of organisms the theory gains a\r\ngreater value, for, while we leave altogether out of account any answer\r\nto the ultimate question, and thus renounce for the present the attempt\r\nto find out how the determinants set to work to call to life the parts\r\nwhich they control, we are brought face to face with other, in a sense,\r\npreliminary questions which we _can_ solve, and the solution of which\r\nseems to me at least not entirely without value.\r\n\r\nThe first of these questions runs thus: Is the power of regeneration a\r\nfundamental, primary character of every living being in the sense that\r\nit is present everywhere in equal strength, independently of external\r\nconditions, and thus is an inevitable outcome of the primary characters\r\nof the living substance? Or is it, though primaeval in its beginnings,\r\na phenomenon of adaptation, which depends on a special mechanism, and\r\ndoes not occur everywhere in equal extent and potency?\r\n\r\nWe have already become acquainted with some facts which must incline us\r\nto the latter view. The globular Alga-colonies of _Volvox_ (Fig. 63)\r\nconsist of two kinds of cells, of which only one kind, the reproductive\r\ncells, possess the power of reproducing the whole, the others, the\r\nflagellate, or, as we called them, somatic cells, being only able to\r\nproduce their like, but never the whole.\r\n\r\nNew investigations which have been carried out by Dr. Otto Hübner in my\r\nInstitute have placed these facts beyond doubt. We may conclude that,\r\nin this case, a disintegration of the germ-plasm has taken place during\r\nontogeny, by means of differential cell-division, so that only the\r\nreproductive cells receive the complete germ-plasm, while the somatic\r\ncells receive only the determinants necessary to their own specific\r\ndifferentiation, the somatic determinants.\r\n\r\nIn this case regeneration and reproduction coincide; there is no\r\nregeneration except the origin of a new individual from a reproductive\r\ncell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35 _B_ (repeated). _Hydra viridis_, the Green\r\nFreshwater Polyp. Section through the body-wall, somewhere in the\r\ndirection of _ov_ in Fig. 35 _A_. _Eiz_, the ovum lying in the ectoderm\r\n(_ect_), and including zoochlorellæ (_schl_) which have immigrated\r\nfrom the endoderm (_ent_) through the supporting lamella (_st_). After\r\nHamann.]\r\n\r\nLet us now ascend to the lowest of the Metazoa, for instance, the\r\nfreshwater polyp, Hydra (Fig. 35 _A_), and we find a high degree of\r\nregenerative capacity in the restricted sense, for, in addition to\r\nthe power of producing germ-cells, that is, cells which, when two\r\ncombine in amphimixis, give rise again to a new animal, almost any\r\npart of the polyp can regrow a whole animal. Not only has Hydra been\r\ncut in from two to twenty different pieces, but it has even been\r\nchopped up into innumerable fragments, and yet each of these, under\r\nfavourable circumstances, was able to grow again into a complete\r\nanimal. Nevertheless, we are not justified in concluding that every\r\ncell possesses the power of reproducing the whole. If, with the help\r\nof a bristle, we turn one of these polyps outside in like the finger\r\nof a glove, and then prevent it turning right again by sticking the\r\nbristle transversely through it, it does not live, but soon dies,\r\nobviously because the cells of the two layers of the body, ectoderm\r\nand endoderm, cannot mutually replace each other, and cannot mutually\r\nproduce each other. The inner layer, now turned outwards, cannot resist\r\nthe influence of the water, and the outer layer, now turned inwards,\r\ncannot effect digestion; in short, one cannot be transformed into the\r\nother, and we must therefore conclude that both are specialized, that\r\nthey no longer contain the complete germ-plasm, but only the specific\r\ndeterminants of ectoderm and endoderm respectively.\r\n\r\nThe animal's high regenerative capacity must therefore depend on the\r\nfact that certain cells of the ectoderm are equipped with the complete\r\ndeterminant-complex of the ectoderm, in the form of an inactive\r\naccessory idioplasm, which is excited to regenerative activity by\r\nthe stimulus of wounding, and that, in the same way, the cells of\r\nthe endoderm are equipped with the whole determinant-complex of the\r\nendoderm. It need not be decided whether all or only many of the\r\ncells, perhaps the younger ones, are thus adapted for regeneration;\r\nin any case a great many of them must be distributed throughout the\r\nwhole body, with perhaps the exception of the tentacles, which are by\r\nthemselves unable to reproduce the whole animal. When the animal is\r\nmutilated, the cells of both layers, equipped with their respective\r\ndeterminant-aggregates, co-operate in reproducing the whole from a part.\r\n\r\nIt is true that even with these assumptions we only reach the threshold\r\nof a real explanation. For, given that all the determinants of the\r\nspecies must be present in a fragment, we are not in a position to show\r\nhow these set about reconstructing the animal in its integrity, and the\r\nmost that we can say is, that it must depend on the specific kind of\r\nstimulus to which each of the cells is exposed through its direct and\r\nmore remote environment, which determinants are to be first liberated,\r\nand therefore which parts are to be reconstructed.\r\n\r\nThat there are at work regulative forces, such as we were already\r\ncompelled to assume in regard to the division and regeneration of\r\nunicellular organisms, as to the nature of which we cannot yet make\r\nany definite statement, but which we may call 'polarities,' or, as I\r\nprefer to say, 'affinities,' is shown by countless experiments which\r\nhave been made, particularly with the freshwater polyp. Thus Rand cut\r\noff the anterior end of the polyp with its circle of tentacles, and the\r\nexcised disk of living substance lengthened in a transverse direction,\r\nso that half the tentacles came to lie to the right, the other half to\r\nthe left, while the body developed between these two groups, so that\r\nthey became further and further separated from each other, till finally\r\nthe original transverse axis of the animal became the longitudinal\r\naxis. One group of tentacles survived and surrounded the new mouth,\r\nwhile the other at the opposite aboral pole, the new foot, died off.\r\nThis total change of structure in the polyp, as to the arrangement of\r\nits main parts, points to unknown forces, which cannot depend on the\r\ndeterminants as such, but on the vital characters of the living parts,\r\nand on the interactions of these with one another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96. A Planarian cut transversely into nine pieces.\r\nThe regeneration of seven of these into entire animals is shown. After\r\nMorgan.]\r\n\r\nThe same holds true of all the lower Metazoa that have highly developed\r\nregenerative capacity, not only of polyps, but of worms such as the\r\nPlanarians. Through the experiments of Loeb, Morgan, Voigt, Bickford,\r\nand others, we know that these animals respond to almost every\r\nmutilation by complete reconstruction, that they may, for instance, as\r\nis indicated in Fig. 96, be cut transversely into nine or ten pieces\r\nwith the result that each of these pieces grows again to a whole\r\nanimal, unless external influences are unfavourable and prevent it.\r\n\r\nSomething similar happens if the head be cut off a Tubularia-polyp, it\r\nforms a new head with proboscis and tentacles. It does so, at least,\r\nif the stalk of the polyp be left in the normal position; but if it\r\nbe stuck into the sand in the reverse position a head arises at the\r\nend which is uppermost, where the roots arose previously, and the\r\nprevious head-end now sends out roots. By suspending a beheaded stalk\r\nhorizontally in the water a head can be caused to develop at each end\r\nof the stalk, so that we must assume that every part of the polyp is,\r\nunder some circumstances, capable of developing a head, and that it\r\nmust be 'circumstances'--in this case gravity, contact with earth or\r\nwith water, and the mutual influence of the parts of the animal upon\r\neach other--which decide what is to be produced. Loeb, who was the\r\nfirst to observe this form of regeneration, called it heteromorphosis,\r\nto express the fact that particular parts of the animal might be\r\nproduced at quite different places from those originally intended for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt would certainly be erroneous to range these cases of heteromorphosis\r\nagainst the determinant theory, but they certainly do not afford any\r\nspecial evidence of its validity as an interpretation, for all that we\r\ncan say here again is that all, or at least many, cells of the animal\r\nmust contain the full determinant-complex of the ectoderm, and others\r\nthose of the endoderm, and that particular groups of determinants\r\nbecome active when they are affected by certain external or internal\r\nliberating stimuli. In regard to such animals the theory is hardly more\r\nconvincing than the rival theory, that the faculty of regeneration is a\r\ngeneral property of living substance, which does not attain to equally\r\nfull expression everywhere, because it is met by ever-increasing\r\ndifficulties involved in the increasing complexity of structure. The\r\nvalidity of the theory only begins to be seen when we deal with cases\r\nwhere it is demonstrable that every part cannot bring forth every\r\nother, where the power of regeneration is limited, and occurs only in\r\ndefinite parts in a definite degree, and can only start from particular\r\nparts. Here the assumption of a general and primary regenerative\r\ncapacity fails. Any one who insists, as O. Hertwig does, that the\r\nidioplasm in all cells of the body is the same, can always plead that,\r\nin the cases in which regeneration does not occur, the fault lies,\r\nnot in the regenerative capacity, but in the absence of the adequate\r\nliberating stimuli, and at first sight it does seem as if this position\r\nwere unassailable. We shall find, however, that there are facts which\r\nmake Hertwig's interpretation quite untenable.\r\n\r\nMy own view is that the regenerative capacity is not something\r\nprimary, but rather an adaptation to the organism's susceptibility to\r\ninjury, that is, a power which occurs in organisms in varying degrees,\r\nproportionate to the degree and frequency of their liability to injury.\r\nRegeneration prevents the injured animal from perishing, or from\r\nliving on in a mutilated state, and in this lies an advantage for the\r\nmaintenance of the species, which is the greater the more frequently\r\ninjuries occur in the species, and the more they menace its life\r\ndirectly or indirectly. A certain degree of regenerative capacity is\r\nthus indispensable to all multicellular animals, even to the highest\r\namong them. We ourselves, for instance, could not escape the numerous\r\ndangers of infection by bacilli and other micro-organisms if our\r\nprotective outer skin did not possess the faculty of regeneration,\r\nat least so far that it can close up a wound and fill up with\r\ncicatrice-tissue a place where a piece of skin has been excised.\r\nObviously, then, the mechanism which evokes regeneration must have\r\nbeen preserved in some degree and in some parts at every stage of the\r\nphyletic development, and must have been strengthened or weakened\r\naccording to the needs of the relevant organism, being concentrated\r\nin certain parts which were much exposed to injury and withdrawn from\r\nother rarely threatened parts. Thus the great diversity which we can\r\nnow observe in the strength and localization of the regenerative\r\ncapacity has been brought about. But all this can only be regarded as\r\nadaptation.\r\n\r\nI should like to submit a few examples to show that the regenerative\r\ncapacity is by no means uniformly distributed, and that, as far as we\r\ncan see, it is greater or less in correspondence with the needs of the\r\nanimal, both in regard to the whole and to particular parts.\r\n\r\nIt must first be pointed out that those lower Metazoa, like the\r\nHydroid polyps in particular, which are endowed with such a high and\r\ngeneral power of regeneration, do actually require this for their\r\nsafety; they are not only soft, easily injured and torn, but they\r\nare most severely decimated by many enemies. In the beginning of May\r\nI found on the walls of the harbour at Marseilles whole forests of\r\npolyp-stocks of the genera _Campanularia_, _Gonothyræa_, and _Obelia_,\r\nall large and splendidly developed, with thousands of individual polyps\r\nand medusoids, but in a very short time the great majority of the\r\npolyps were eaten up by little spectre-shrimps (Caprellids) and other\r\ncrustaceans, worms, and numerous other enemies, and towards the end of\r\nMay it was no longer possible to find a fine well-grown colony. It must\r\ntherefore be of decisive importance for these species if the stems and\r\nbranches, which are spared because protected by horny tubes, possess\r\nthe faculty of transforming their simple soft parts into polyp-heads,\r\nor of giving off buds which become polyps, or even of growing a new\r\nstock from the twigs which have been half-eaten and bitten loose from\r\nthe stock and have fallen to the ground. If, finally, a torn-off\r\npolyp-stalk (of _Tubularia_) falls to the ground with the wrong side\r\nup, the end which is now the lower will send out roots, and the end\r\nnow uppermost will give off a new head. This also appears to us\r\nadaptive, and does not surprise us, since we have been long accustomed\r\nto recognize that what is adapted to an end will realize this if it be\r\npossible at all. Think again of the innumerable adaptations in colour\r\nand form which we discussed in the earlier lectures. I hope later to\r\nbe able to show in more detail how it comes to pass that necessity\r\ngives rise to adaptation. In regard to the case of the polyps, we can\r\nunderstand that, as far as a high degree of regeneration and budding\r\nwas possible in these animals at all, it could not but be developed.\r\nRegeneration and budding complete each other in this case, for the\r\nformer brings about in the individual 'person' what the latter does\r\nin the colony, namely, a _Restitutio in integrum_. It is readily\r\nintelligible that the former was not difficult to establish where the\r\nlatter--the capacity of budding--was already in existence.\r\n\r\nIt seems at first sight very striking that the higher plants, which all\r\ndepend upon budding, and which form plant-colonies (corms) in the same\r\nsense as the polyps form animal-colonies, only possess the faculty of\r\ntrue regeneration in a very low degree, although they are extremely\r\nliable to injury.\r\n\r\nWe see from this that the two capacities are not co-extensive, that\r\ngerm-plasm may be contained in numerous cells of the body in a latent\r\nstate, and yet that regeneration of each and every detailed defect\r\nmay not be possible. This is the case in the higher plants in regard\r\nto most of their parts. A leaf in which a hole has been cut does not\r\nclose the hole with new cell-material; a fern frond from which some\r\nof the pinnules have been cut off does not grow new ones, but remains\r\nmutilated. Even leaves which, if laid on damp earth, readily give off\r\nbuds which grow to new plants, as the Begonias do, do not replace a\r\npiece cut out of the leaf; they are not at all adapted to regeneration.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of utility this is readily intelligible. It was,\r\nso to speak, not worth Nature's while to make such adaptations in the\r\ncase of leaves or blossoms, partly because these are very transient\r\nstructures, and partly because they are rapidly and easily replaceable\r\nby the development of others of the same kind. Moreover, the leaf in\r\nwhich we have cut a hole continues to function, but the polyp whose\r\nmouth and tentacles we have cut off could no longer take nourishment\r\nunless it were adapted for regeneration. But that this adaptation\r\n_could_ have been made in the case of plants is proved by the\r\nroot-tips which are formed anew when they are injured, and the closing\r\nof wounds on the stem by a 'callus.'\r\n\r\nI shall return to plants when we are dealing with the mechanism\r\nof regeneration, but I must now direct more attention to animals,\r\ninquiring further into the question as to whether the faculty of\r\nregeneration is correlated with the degree of liability to injury to\r\nwhich the animal is exposed, and with the biological importance of\r\nthe injured part, for this must be the case if regeneration be really\r\nregulated by adaptation.\r\n\r\nHardly any other vertebrate has attained such celebrity on account of\r\nits high regenerative capacity as the water-newt, species of the genus\r\n_Triton_. It can regrow not only its tail, but the legs and their parts\r\nif they are cut off. Spallanzani saw the legs grow six times, after\r\nhe had cut them off six times. In the blind newt (_Proteus_) of the\r\nKrainer caves, a near relative of the common newt, the leg regenerated\r\nonly after a year and a half, although the animal stands on a lower\r\nstage of organization than the newt, and thus should rather replace\r\nlost parts more easily. But Proteus lives sheltered from danger in\r\ndark, still caves, while Triton is exposed to numerous enemies which\r\nbite off pieces from its tail or legs; and the legs are its chief means\r\nof locomotion, without which it would have difficulty in procuring\r\nfood. It is different with the elongated eel-like newt of the marshes\r\nof South Carolina, _Siren lacertina_. This animal moves by wriggling\r\nits very muscular trunk, after the manner of an eel, and in consequence\r\nof the disuse of its hind legs it has almost completely lost them. Even\r\nthe fore-legs have become small and weak, and possess only two toes,\r\nand these do not regrow if they are bitten off, or only do so very\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nEarthworms are exposed to much persecution; not only birds, such as\r\nblackbirds and some woodpeckers, but, above all, the moles prey upon\r\nthem, and Dahl has shown that moles often lay up stores of worms in\r\nwinter which they have half crippled by a bite, while even Réaumur\r\nknew that moles frequently only half devoured earthworms. It was\r\nthus an obvious advantage to earthworms that a part of the animal\r\nshould be able to regrow a whole, and accordingly we find a fairly\r\nwell-developed regenerative capacity among them. But it varies greatly\r\nin the different species, and it would be interesting if we knew the\r\nconditions of life well enough to be able to decide whether the faculty\r\nof regeneration rises and falls in proportion to the dangers to which\r\nthe species is exposed. Unfortunately we are far from this as yet; we\r\nonly know that, in the common earthworms of the genera _Lumbricus_ and\r\n_Allolobophora_, the faculty of regeneration is still very limited,\r\nfor at most two worms, and sometimes only one, can develop from an\r\nanimal cut into two pieces. Cutting into a greater number of pieces\r\ndoes not yield a larger number of worms, but usually only one, and\r\noften none at all.\r\n\r\nThis corresponds to the behaviour of their enemies, which may often\r\nbite off a piece or tear it away when the worm attempts to escape, but\r\nnever cut it up into pieces. The regenerative capacity is more highly\r\ndeveloped in the genus _Allurus_, more highly still in the worms of the\r\ngenus _Criodrilus_ which lives in the mud at the bottom of lakes, and\r\nmost highly of all in the genus _Lumbriculus_ which lives at the bottom\r\nof small ponds. Long ago Bonnet cut up a specimen of _Lumbriculus_ into\r\ntwenty-six pieces, of about two millimetres in length, and he observed\r\nmost of these grow to complete worms again. His experiments have often\r\nbeen repeated in recent times, and have been extended and made more\r\nprecise in many ways. Von Bülow was able to get whole animals from\r\npieces consisting of from four to five somatic segments, and with eight\r\nor nine segments he almost invariably succeeded. A _Lumbriculus_ which\r\nhe had cut into fourteen pieces, one of which only measured 3.5 mm. in\r\nlength, gave rise to thirteen complete worms with head and tail; only\r\none piece perished.\r\n\r\nThese worms have little enemies with sharp jaws which may gnaw at them\r\nbehind or before but cannot swallow them whole. Lyonet, famous for his\r\nanalytic dissection of the wood-caterpillar (_Cossus ligniperda_),\r\nobserved when he was feeding the larvæ of dragon-flies with these\r\nLumbriculid worms that 'the anterior end of some whose posterior end\r\nhad been gnawed away by the larvæ continued to live on the ground.' We\r\ncan thus understand why a high power of regeneration is of use to these\r\nworms, and at the same time why it is advantageous to them to contract\r\nso that they break in pieces on very slight irritation, but to this we\r\nshall refer again.\r\n\r\nThe very diverse potency of the faculty of regeneration in animals\r\nbelonging to the same small group, and nearly, if not quite, at the\r\nsame level of organization, seems to show clearly that we have here to\r\ndo with adaptation to different conditions of life, although we cannot\r\ndemonstrate this in detail. It would certainly be erroneous to regard\r\nthe conditions of life as uniform, since the worms in question not\r\nonly live in different places--in the earth, in mud, or in water--and\r\nare thus exposed to different enemies, and since they may also be\r\nquite different in regard to size and speed, in means of defence, and\r\npossibly also of defiance, as is indeed in some measure demonstrable.\r\n\r\nWe meet with the same thing in a group of still smaller worms, Rösel's\r\n'water-snakelets,' species of the genus _Nais_. These, too, behave in a\r\nvariety of ways in the matter of regeneration, for while many species,\r\nsuch as _Nais proboscidea_ and _Nais serpentina_ will, if cut into\r\ntwo or three pieces, become two or three worms respectively, Bonnet\r\nexpressly mentions an unnamed species of _Nais_ which does not bear\r\ncutting up at all, and even dies if its head be cut off.\r\n\r\nThus neither the degree of organization nor the relationship alone\r\ndetermines the strength of the regenerative capacity. And as nearly\r\nrelated species may behave quite differently in this respect, so also\r\ndo the different parts of one and the same animal; and here, too, the\r\nstrength of the capacity seems to depend on the more frequent or rarer\r\ninjury of the relevant part and on its importance in the maintenance of\r\nlife. Let us take a few examples.\r\n\r\nParts which, in the natural life of the animal, are never injured, show\r\nin many cases no power of regeneration. This is so in regard to the\r\ninternal parts of the newt, whose regenerative capacity is otherwise\r\nso high. I cut half or nearly the whole of a lung away from newts\r\nanæsthetized with ether; the wound closed, _but no renewal of the organ\r\ntook place_. The same thing happened when a piece of the spermatic duct\r\nor of the oviduct was cut away. It is true that the kidney enlarges in\r\nhigher animals when a piece has been cut out, by the proliferation of\r\nthe remaining tissues, but that is a mere physiological substitution,\r\nevoked by the increased functional stimulus, due to the accumulation in\r\nthe blood of the constituents of the urine. Such substitution depends\r\non the growth of parts already existing, and it occurs in man when one\r\nkidney is removed, for the other, as is well known, may then grow to\r\ndouble its normal size. This is mere hypertrophy of the part that is\r\nleft, it is not regeneration in the morphological sense, and it is not\r\ncomparable to the re-formation of a cut-off leg in the salamander, or\r\nof a head in the worm, where the growth is not a mere increase of the\r\nremaining stump, but a new formation. It would be regeneration if a\r\nnew kidney developed from the remnants of the kidney-tissue, or, in\r\nthe liver, if new lobes grew in place of those which were cut off. But\r\nneither of these things happens, and, as far as I am aware, nothing of\r\nthe kind has ever been observed, nothing more than new formation of\r\nliver-cells through increase of existing ones; that, however, is not\r\nregeneration in the morphological sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have referred to the slight power of regeneration possessed by the\r\nblind Proteus in regard to its legs or tail, and I connected this with\r\nthe absence of enemies in its thinly peopled cave-habitat. But the same\r\nanimal can regenerate its gills when these are bitten off, and this is\r\nprobably associated with the habit that Proteus has, in common with\r\nother newts with external gills, of nibbling at its neighbour's gills.\r\nThus, the power of regenerating the gills was retained even when the\r\nanimals migrated to the quiet caves of Krain, and were thus secured\r\nfrom the attacks of other enemies.\r\n\r\nIn lizards, a leg which has been cut off does not grow again, but an\r\namputated tail does, and this has quite a definite biological reason,\r\nsince the active little animal will seldom be caught by the foot by any\r\npursuer, but may easily be caught by the tail, which is far behind.\r\nThus the tail is adapted not only for regeneration, but also for\r\n'autotomy' that is, for breaking off easily when it is caught hold of.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that some segmented worms have a very high\r\nregenerative capacity; yet every part cannot produce every other, and\r\nwhile, in _Lumbriculus_, any piece of from five to nine segments is\r\nable to grow a new head or tail, neither ten nor twenty nor all the\r\nsegments together, if they are _halved longitudinally_, can reproduce\r\nthe other half, and the cause of this inability does not lie in the\r\nfact that the animal is thereby hindered from taking food, for even the\r\ntransversely cut pieces do not feed until they have grown a new head\r\nand tail. The reason must lie in the fact that the primary constituents\r\nfor this kind of regeneration are wanting, and they are so because a\r\nlongitudinal splitting of this cylindrical and relatively thin animal\r\nnever occurs under natural conditions, and thus could not be provided\r\nagainst by Nature[1].\r\n\r\n[1] Morgan maintains that this statement is incorrect, and that\r\n_Lumbriculus_ is capable of lateral regeneration. But if we look into\r\nthe matter more closely we find that all he says is, that small gaps\r\nmade by cutting a piece out of one side are filled up again, while the\r\ncut pieces perish. If the whole animal be halved, according to Morgan,\r\nboth halves die, or if a 'very long piece' be cut out of one side, not\r\nonly this piece dies, but also 'the remaining piece.' There is thus, as\r\nI have said, an essential difference between the regenerative capacity\r\nof _Lumbriculus_ and that of _Planaria_.\r\n\r\nThat regeneration of this kind could have been arranged for if it had\r\nbeen useful we learn from the Planarians among the flat worms, in which\r\nevery piece cut out of the body, large or very small, from the middle,\r\nfrom the left side, or from the right side of the animal, grows into\r\na complete Planarian. The animal can be halved longitudinally, as\r\nin Fig. 97, and each half will grow to a whole. This again is quite\r\nintelligible from the biological point of view, for these flat, soft,\r\nand easily torn animals are exposed to all sorts of injuries, and are,\r\nin point of fact, frequently mutilated by enemies which are unable to\r\nswallow them whole. Von Graaf not infrequently found examples of marine\r\nPlanarians (_Macrostomum_) which lacked 'a part of the posterior end\r\nor the whole tail region as far as the food-canal,' and of species of\r\n_Monotus_ he found 'very often' in May specimens with the posterior\r\nend split or broken off. Probably the persecutors of these flat-worms\r\nare some species of Crustacean, but, at any rate, so much is proved,\r\nthat the Planarians have abundant opportunities of making use of their\r\nfaculty of regeneration, and that the species gains an advantage from\r\nit in respect to its preservation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97. _A_, a Planarian, which has been divided into\r\ntwo by a longitudinal cut. Each half can grow into an entire animal.\r\n_B_, the left half at the beginning of the regenerative process. _C_,\r\nthe same completed. After Morgan.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this, worms which live within other animals, and\r\nare thus secure from mutilation, such as the familiar round-worms\r\n(_Nematoda_), have no power of regeneration at all, and do not survive\r\neither longitudinal or transverse division.\r\n\r\nUntil recently birds were regarded as possessing a very low degree of\r\nregenerative capacity, and, as a matter of fact, they cannot replace\r\na leg or a wing wholly or in part; but, what is otherwise unheard of\r\namong higher vertebrates, they can renew the whole anterior portion of\r\nthe skeleton of the face, the bill, and can indeed almost reconstruct\r\nit with new bones and horny parts. Von Kennel communicated a case of\r\nthis kind in regard to a stork, and for a long time this remained an\r\nisolated case, but a few years ago Bordage showed that, in the cocks\r\nwhich are used in the Island of Bourbon for the favourite sport of\r\ncock-fighting, the bill is regularly renewed when it has been broken\r\noff or shattered. Quite recently Barfurth gave an account of a case\r\nof complete renewal of a broken bill in a parrot. Yet it should not\r\nastonish us that the bill in birds has such a high regenerative\r\npower, for of all parts in a bird it is the one that is most readily\r\ninjured; with it the bird defends itself against its enemies and its\r\nrivals, masters its prey, and tears it to pieces, pecks holes in trees\r\n(woodpecker), or climbs (parrot), or digs and burrows in the ground,\r\nor builds its nest, and so on. That the faculty of regeneration could\r\nbe developed to so high a degree in relation to this particular part\r\nof the body, while the rest of the very important but rarely injured\r\nparts do not possess it at all, again points to the conclusion that the\r\nfaculty of regeneration has an adaptive character.\r\n\r\nIt does not affect matters to discover cases in which we cannot\r\nrecognize this relation between the regenerative capacity of a part\r\nand its importance or its liability to injury. Such instances do not\r\nlessen the convincingness of the positive cases, since we do not know\r\nthe exact conditions which may lead to the increase of regenerative\r\ncapacity in a part, and, above all, since we do not know the rate at\r\nwhich such an increase may take place. If adaptation in general depends\r\nupon processes of selection, these processes must also be able to give\r\nrise to an increase in the power of regeneration. On the other hand, it\r\nby no means follows that the disappearance of a faculty of regeneration\r\nwhich was once present in a part, but which has become superfluous\r\nin the course of time, must take place immediately through natural\r\nselection. For it is the very essence of natural selection that it only\r\nfurthers what is useful, and only removes what is injurious; over what\r\nis indifferent it has no power at all. Thus it follows that the faculty\r\nof regeneration, when it has once been present in a part, cannot be\r\nset aside by natural selection (personal selection), for it is in no\r\nway injurious to its possessor. If it gradually decreases and becomes\r\nextinct notwithstanding this, when it is of no further use, as seems to\r\nbe to some extent the case in regard to the legs and tail of the blind\r\nProteus, that must depend on other processes, on those which generally\r\nbring about the gradual disappearance of disused parts or capacities.\r\nWe shall attempt to probe to the roots of these processes later on;\r\nfor the present let it suffice us to know that, according to our\r\nexperience, they go on with exceeding slowness, and that it has taken\r\nwhole geological periods to eliminate the legs of the snake-ancestors\r\nso completely as has been done from the structure of most of our modern\r\nsnakes, while the Proteus which migrated into the caves of Krain as far\r\nback as the Cretaceous period is indeed blind, but still retains its\r\neyes under the skin, though in a degenerate condition.\r\n\r\nSince the degeneration of disused parts and capacities goes on so\r\nslowly it need not surprise us that we meet many parts which still\r\npossess regenerative capacity, although they are protected from\r\ninjury. Thus Morgan found that, in the hermit-crab, the limbs which\r\nare protected within the mollusc shell were quite as ready to regrow\r\nas those which are actually used for walking, and thus are exposed to\r\npossibility of attack, but this proves nothing against the conclusion\r\nwe drew from the facts cited above, according to which the faculty of\r\nregeneration comes under the law of adaptation. For the disappearance\r\nof this faculty must take place very much more _slowly than its\r\ngrowth_. For instance, the development of the tail-fin of the whale has\r\nlong been an accomplished fact, while the hind-legs of this colossal\r\nmammal, which were rendered useless by the development of the tail-fin,\r\nstill lie concealed in a rudimentary state within the muscles of the\r\ntrunk. Yet these limbs must have lost their significance for the animal\r\nexactly at the time that the tail-fin became more powerful. Thus the\r\nretrogression must have taken place more slowly than the progressive\r\ntransformation.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that the faculty of regeneration is not a primary\r\ncharacter of living beings occurring uniformly in all species of\r\nequally high organization and in all parts of an animal in the same\r\ndegree; it is a power which occurs in animals of equal complexity in as\r\nvarying degrees as in their parts, and which is manifestly regulated by\r\nadaptation. Between parts with the faculty of regeneration and parts\r\nwithout it there must be an essential difference; there must be present\r\nin the former something that is wanting in the latter, and, according\r\nto our theory, this is the equipment with regeneration-determinants,\r\nthat is, with the determinants of the parts which are to be\r\nreconstructed.\r\n\r\nIf this be really so it should be capable of proof, at least in so\r\nfar that we should be able to establish that the power of completing\r\nor re-forming a damaged or lost part is a limited one, localized in\r\ncertain parts and cell-layers. This can be actually proved, as may\r\nbe seen from numerous cases in which the faculty of regeneration is\r\nassociated with autotomy, that is, with the power of breaking off or\r\ndropping off a part of the body. Even in worms we find this power,\r\nas we mentioned before in speaking of the high regenerative capacity\r\nof _Lumbriculus_. This worm reproduces in summer by what is called\r\n'schizogony,' that is, by breaking into two, three, or more pieces, and\r\nit does not seem to require a very strong stimulus, such as pressure\r\nof the end of the worm by the jaws of an insect larva, to start this\r\nrupture; it often follows from quite insignificant friction on the\r\nground. Certainly the power of regeneration is so great in this animal\r\nthat it is out of the question to talk of localizing the primary\r\nconstituents of regeneration; almost every broken surface is capable of\r\nregeneration.\r\n\r\nBut this localization is well illustrated in Insects and Crustaceans,\r\nwhich possess the power of self-amputation in their appendages,\r\nespecially in their legs. As far back as 1826 MacCullock observed\r\nthis remarkable power in crabs, and described the mechanism on which\r\nit depends. When the leg is irritated, for instance when it is pinched\r\nat the tip and held fast, it breaks off at a particular place. This\r\nline of breakage lies in the middle of the short second joint (Fig.\r\n98, _A_ and _B_, _s_), just between the insertions of the muscles\r\n(_me_, _mf_, _m_) which extend from this line towards the extremity of\r\nthe limb and in the opposite direction towards the body-wall. Between\r\nthese muscle-attachments the external skeleton is thin and brittle, and\r\nforms a suture, _s_, which breaks through when the animal contracts\r\nthe muscles of the leg convulsively, and thus presses the lower\r\nprotuberance (_a_) against a projection (_b_) of the first upper joint.\r\nCrabs require to make a very considerable muscular exertion before they\r\ncan throw off the limb, and therefore they can only do it when they are\r\nin full vigour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98. The leg of a Crab, adapted for self-mutilation\r\nor autotomy. _A_, the first three joints of the limb, _I_, _II_, _III_.\r\n_s_, the suture, that is, a thin area on the second joint which is\r\npredisposed to breakage. _mf_, flexor muscle, _me_, extensor muscle,\r\nboth inserted at the suture. _B_, the entire leg with its six joints\r\nand with the suture (_s_). Slightly enlarged. After MacCullock.]\r\n\r\nWe have here a quite definite structural adaptation of the parts to a\r\ndanger which often recurs--that of falling entirely into the power of\r\nan enemy which has seized the leg. By a sudden violent throwing-off of\r\nthe leg the crab escapes from this danger. Quite similar adaptations\r\nare found among certain insects, such as the walking-stick insects\r\nor Phasmids, in which the mechanism is much the same, and lies at an\r\nalmost exactly corresponding place, namely, at the line where the\r\nsecond and third joints of the leg, the 'trochanter' and the 'femur'\r\nmeet. In this case the advantage of the arrangement is not merely that\r\nthe animals are thus enabled to escape from enemies; it is useful in\r\nanother connexion, for a knowledge of which we have to thank Bordage.\r\nThis naturalist observed that the Phasmids not infrequently perished at\r\none of their numerous moultings, by remaining partially fixed in the\r\ndiscarded husk. Of 100 Phasmids nine died in this way, twenty-two got\r\nfree with the loss of one or more legs, and only sixty-nine survived\r\nthe moult without any loss at all.\r\n\r\nThat the moulting or ecdysis of insects is often hazardous may be\r\nobserved in our own country, and it is familiar to every one who has\r\nreared caterpillars. These, too, often fail to get clear of their\r\n'cast' cuticle, and they perish unless artificial aid is given to them.\r\nI have never observed any autotomy in them, but in the Phasmids it\r\nseems to be a much-used 'device' and is therefore of great importance\r\nin the persistence of the species.\r\n\r\nLimbs which are thus thrown off by autotomy regenerate again from\r\nthe place at which they broke off, that is from the 'suture.' It\r\nhad been noticed even by the earlier observers (e.g. Goodsir) that\r\nthere was a jelly-like mass of cells within the joint, and that the\r\ndevelopment of the new limb started from this. It might be supposed\r\nthat the regeneration-primordium is present in the rest of the leg\r\nalso, but that is not the case, for the animal responds to the tearing\r\noff of one joint or of a smaller number than to the suture, not by\r\nregenerating the torn part directly, but by amputating the whole of\r\nthe leg up to the suture, and then from this the regeneration of the\r\nwhole leg takes place. In the Phasmids the case is similar, but with\r\nthe difference that regeneration is possible from three places, from\r\nthe tarsal joints, from the lower third of the tibia, and finally,\r\nfrom the suture between the femur and the trochanter. There is thus\r\na regeneration-primordium (_Anlage_) at the beginning of the tarsal\r\njoints, another in the tibia, and a third in the 'suture' and the first\r\nmust be equipped, as we should express it, with the determinants of\r\nthe five tarsal joints, the second with those for the lower end of the\r\ntibia as well, and the third with all the determinants of the whole\r\nleg, from the 'suture' downwards.\r\n\r\nIn any case, regeneration is here associated with definite localized\r\npieces of tissue, and is not a general character of all the cells of\r\nthe leg, and, as it obviously runs parallel at the same time with\r\nanother adaptation--that of autotomy--there can be no doubt that it too\r\nis dominated by the principle of selection, and that it can not only\r\nbe increased, but that it can be concentrated at particular places and\r\nremoved from others. But this is only possible if it be bound up with\r\nmaterial particles which may be present in or absent from a tissue, and\r\nwhich are therefore a supplement to the ordinary essential constituents\r\nof the living cells, although they do not themselves belong to the\r\nessential organization.\r\n\r\nI might cite many more examples of localization of regenerative\r\ncapacity, but will confine myself to one other, which seems to me\r\nparticularly instructive, because it was first interpreted as an\r\nindication of the existence of an adaptive principle in the organism,\r\na principle which always creates what is useful. I refer to the\r\nregeneration of the lens in the newt's larva.\r\n\r\nG. Wolff, an obstinate opponent of the theory of selection, attempted\r\nto solve the same problem as I had before me in my experiments on the\r\nregeneration of the internal organs of newts, that is, he tried to\r\nanswer the question whether organs which are never exposed to injury or\r\nto complete removal in the conditions of natural life, and which could\r\nnot therefore have been influenced in this direction by the processes\r\nof selection, are nevertheless capable of regeneration. He extirpated\r\nthe lens from the eye of Triton larvæ, and saw that in a short time it\r\nwas formed anew, and from this he concluded that there was here 'a new\r\nadaptiveness appearing for the first time,' and that therefore adaptive\r\nforces must be dominant within the organism. The current theory of\r\nthe 'mechanical' origin of vital adjustments seemed to some to be\r\nshaken by this, and the proclamation of the old 'vital force' seemed\r\nimminent. And in truth, if the body were really able to replace, after\r\nartificial injury, parts which are never liable to injury in natural\r\nconditions, and to do so in a most beautiful and appropriate manner,\r\nthen there would be nothing for it but at least to regard the faculty\r\nof regeneration as a primary power of living creatures, and to think of\r\nthe organism as like a crystal, which invariably completes itself if it\r\nbe damaged in any part. But we have to ask whether this is really the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the regeneration of the lens seem particularly surprising\r\nis the fact that in the fully formed animal it must arise in a manner\r\ndifferent from that in which it develops in the embryo, that is, it\r\nmust be formed from different cell-material. In the embryo it arises\r\nby the proliferation and invagination of the epidermic layer of\r\ncells to meet the so-called 'primary' optic vesicle growing out from\r\nthe brain--a mode of development which cannot of course be repeated\r\nunder the altered conditions in the fully developed animal. The\r\nreconstruction of the organ must therefore take place in a different\r\nway, and if the organism were really able, the very first time the lens\r\nwas removed, to react in a manner so perfectly adapted to the end,\r\nand so to inspire certain cells, which had till then had a different\r\nfunction, that they could put together a lens of flawless beauty and\r\ntransparency, we should have reason to suspect that nearly all our\r\nprevious conceptions were erroneous, and to fall back upon a belief in\r\na _spiritus rector_ in the organism.\r\n\r\nBut the excision of the lens in these experiments was not by any means\r\nan unprecedented occurrence! It is true enough that newts in their\r\npools are not liable to an operation for cataract, but it does not\r\nfollow that the lens is never liable to injury, and could not therefore\r\nbe adapted for regeneration. It can be bitten out along with the rest\r\nof the eye by water-beetles or other enemies, and as far back as the\r\ntime of Bonnet and Blumenbach (1781) it was known that the eye of the\r\nnewt would renew itself if it were cut out, given that a small portion\r\nof the bulb was left. But if this were removed the possibility of\r\nregeneration was at an end. Thus, before the first artificial excision\r\nof the lens, a regeneration-mechanism must have existed, by means of\r\nwhich the eye with its lens was reconstructed, and this depends on the\r\ncharacters of the cells of the eye itself--it is localized in the eye,\r\nand without the presence of a piece of eye-tissue no regeneration can\r\ntake place. Is it then so especially remarkable that the lens should\r\nbe renewed when it is artificially removed without the rest of the\r\neye? The mechanism for its renewal is there, and is roused to activity\r\nwhether the lens alone or other parts of the eye also be removed.\r\nWe do not need, therefore, to assume the existence of a purposeful\r\nor adaptive force; it is more to the point to inquire where the\r\nregeneration-mechanism which suggests this inference is to be found.\r\n\r\nA definite answer to this is given in a detailed experimental work\r\nrecently published by Fischel. It corroborates what Wolff had already\r\nfound, that the substance of the new lens develops from cells which\r\ncover the posterior surface of the iris, that is, from cells of the\r\nretinal layer of the eye. First, the margin of the pupil begins to\r\nreact to the stimulus of the injury (extraction of the lens); its cells\r\nenlarge, become clear, while previously they were filled with dark\r\npigment, and finally they proliferate. They thus form a cell-vesicle\r\nsimilar to the ectoderm-vesicle from which the lens arises in the\r\nembryo, and into this the already mentioned retina-cells from the\r\nposterior wall of the iris grow, elongate, and arrange themselves to\r\nform the so-called 'lens-fibres,' on whose form, arrangement, and\r\ntransparency the function of the lens depends. This is marvellous\r\nenough, but not more marvellous than that a whole foot should grow\r\non the cut stump of a newt's leg, or that a whole eye should arise\r\nfrom a residual fragment. Here, again, we do not know the processes\r\nwhich cause the arrangement of the cells and their often manifold\r\nlocally-conditioned differentiations, in short, we do not know the\r\n_essential nature of regeneration_. But, in the meantime, we can\r\nendeavour to find out which cell-groups regeneration is bound up with\r\nin particular cases, so as to know where the vital particles, the\r\n'determinants,' which condition regeneration, are placed by nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99. Regeneration of the lens in the Newt's eye.\r\n_A_, section through the iris (_J_); from its margin and posterior\r\n(retinal) surface the primordium of a new lens (_L_) has developed\r\nafter the artificial removal of the old one. _B_, section through the\r\neye after duplicated regeneration of the lens (_L_) from two areas of\r\nthe iris. _Gl_, vitreous humour. _J_, iris. _C_, cornea. _R_, retina.\r\nAfter Fischel.]\r\n\r\nIn this case there can be no doubt on that point: they are the cells\r\non the posterior wall and the margin of the iris. And it is certainly\r\nnot the _absence_ of the lens which gives rise to its renewal, as would\r\nnecessarily be the case if it were due to the dominance of an adaptive\r\nforce. If the lens, instead of being excised, be simply pressed back\r\ninto the vitreous humour occupying the cavity of the eye, a new lens is\r\ndeveloped all the same from the irritated margin of the pupil. And if\r\nby chance this margin has been irritated in two places while extraction\r\nof the lens was being performed, then two small lenses will develop\r\n(Fig. 99, _B_). Indeed, several may begin to develop at the posterior\r\nwall of the iris, although they do not attain to full development;\r\nmechanical irritation of any part of this cell-layer is responded to by\r\nthe formation of lenses. This surely disposes of the 'mystical nimbus'\r\nwhich would dazzle us with a new force of life, always creating what\r\nis appropriate. We have before us an adaptation to the liability of\r\nnewts' eyes to injury, which, like all adaptations, is only relatively\r\nperfect, since under the usual conditions of eye injury it gives\r\nrise to a usable lens, but under unusual conditions to unsuitable\r\nstructures. It is exactly the same as in the case of animal instincts,\r\nwhich are all 'calculated' for the _ordinary_ conditions of life, but,\r\nunder unusual conditions, may operate in a manner quite unsuited to the\r\nnecessary end. The ant-lion has the instinct to bore backwards into the\r\nsand, and he makes the same backward-pressing movements when placed\r\non a glass plate into which he cannot force the tip of the abdomen.\r\nThe same is true of the mole-cricket, which makes its usual digging\r\nmovements with the forelegs even on a plate of glass. The wall-bee\r\nroofs over her cell when she has laid an egg in it, but she does so\r\neven if the egg be taken out beforehand, or if a hole be made in the\r\nbottom of the cell, so that the honey which is to serve the larva for\r\nfood when it emerges from the egg runs out (Fabre). Her instinct is\r\ncalculated for filling the cell _once_ with honey, and _once_ laying\r\nan egg in it, because such disturbances as we may cause artificially\r\ndo not occur or occur very rarely in natural conditions. There are\r\ncountless facts of this kind, for every instinct and every adaptation\r\ncan, in certain circumstances, go astray and become inappropriate. This\r\nshould be considered by those who still persist in opposing the theory\r\nof selection, for herein lies one of the most convincing proofs of its\r\ncorrectness. Adaptations can only arise in reference to the majority of\r\noccurrences, and variations which are only useful in an individual case\r\nmust, according to the principle, disappear again. Adaptation always\r\nmeans the establishment of what is appropriate in an average number of\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nTherefore the inappropriate reaction of the margin of the iris to an\r\nartificial double stimulus affords additional reason for regarding\r\nregeneration as an adaptive phenomenon. If it were the outcome of\r\nan adaptive force it could never be inappropriate; and if it were\r\nthe operation of a general and primary power of the organism it\r\nwould be exhibited by the nearly-related frog as well as by the\r\nnewt. But, in the frog, extraction of the lens gives rise only to a\r\nsac-like proliferation of the cells of the iris margin, which form no\r\ntransparent lens, but an opaque cluster of cells, which destroys vision\r\naltogether. It appears, therefore, that the frog no longer requires the\r\npower its ancestors possessed of regenerating a lost lens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXI\r\n\r\nREGENERATION (_continued_)\r\n\r\n Phyletic origin of the regenerative capacity--The liberating stimuli\r\n of regeneration--Production of extra heads and tails in Planarians\r\n (Voigt)--Regeneration in the Starfish--Atavistic regeneration in\r\n Insects and Crustaceans--Progressive regeneration--Regeneration has\r\n its roots in the differentiation of organisms--The nuclear substance\r\n of unicellular organisms is the first organ for regeneration--The\r\n ultimate roots of regeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous lecture we have considered many different forms of\r\nregeneration, and have recognized them as adaptive phenomena; we have\r\nnow to inquire how such regeneration-adaptations have arisen, and this\r\nis a very difficult question even in general, while in particular\r\ncases it is often quite unanswerable at present. In regard to the\r\ncase last discussed, the regeneration of the lens in the eye of\r\nTriton, our hypotheses would require to reach back to the time of the\r\nprimitive vertebrates with an unpaired eye, for the lens of the paired\r\nvertebrate eye, from Mammals down to the lowest Fishes, does not arise\r\nin embryonic development from the retinal cells, but always from the\r\ncorneal epithelium, as the elaborate researches of Rabl have recently\r\nshown. It is true that the unpaired parietal eye of some reptiles forms\r\nits lens from the cells of the retinal layer, but it would be difficult\r\nto demonstrate the possibility of a genetic connexion between it and\r\npaired eyes, and in the meantime we must refrain from elaborating a\r\nhypothesis as to the origin of the marvellous faculty the retinal cells\r\npossess of transforming themselves into lens-fibres.\r\n\r\nBut it is easier to form some sort of picture of the origin and\r\nadaptation of the faculty of regeneration in general.\r\n\r\nWe saw that the power of regenerating a part can be localized, and\r\nthat it does not belong to all the cells of the body, but only\r\nto some of them, and we have to ask how and by what steps it has\r\nbeen imparted to these. The faculty depends on the possession of a\r\nregeneration-primordium (_Anlage_), and this again, in our mode of\r\nexpression, consists of a definite complex of determinants, and as\r\ndeterminants are the products of an evolution, and thus are vital units\r\nwhich have arisen historically, they can nowhere suddenly originate\r\nanew in a species, but must be derived directly or indirectly from the\r\nsole basis which, in each species, forms the starting-point of the\r\nindividual--that is to say, in the Metazoa, from the germ-plasm of the\r\novum. From it the determinant-complex of every regeneration-rudiment\r\nmast in the ultimate instance be derived.\r\n\r\nWe may think of the matter thus: all the determinants of the germ-plasm\r\nvary, grow slowly or quickly, and in certain circumstances may be\r\ndoubled. In this way there arise what we may call 'supernumerary'\r\ndeterminants, which are not required in the primary building up of\r\nthe body from the ovum, and which may remain in an inactive state in\r\nthe nuclei of certain cells, ready to become active under certain\r\ncircumstances and to produce anew the part which they control. Such\r\nregeneration-idioplasm will at first come to lie in the younger\r\ncells of the determinate organ, but it is conceivable that under the\r\ninfluence of selection it may be gradually shifted to other cells of\r\na later developmental origin, or, conversely, to others in a less\r\nexternal position, so that, for instance, the regeneration-rudiment for\r\nthe finger of a newt may be contained not merely in the cells of the\r\nhand, but in those of the fore-arm or even of the upper arm.\r\n\r\nBut all such segregation of determinant-groups cannot have taken place,\r\nas we might perhaps be inclined to think, at the periphery in the organ\r\nitself during its development; it must take place in the germ-plasm of\r\nthe ovum, for otherwise it could not be transmissible, and could not be\r\ndirected and modified by the processes of selection, as is actually the\r\ncase, as I shall show in more detail later on.\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out the importance of the rôle played by\r\nliberating stimuli in regeneration, and not only of extra-organismal\r\nstimuli, such as gravity, but above all of intra-organismal stimuli\r\nthat is, the influences exerted in a mysterious manner by other parts\r\nof the animal on the parts which are in process of regeneration. It\r\nis a great merit of the modern tendency in evolution theory that it\r\nhas demonstrated the importance of such internal influences. Although\r\nwe are still far from being able to define the manner in which these\r\ninfluences operate, we may say so much, that it depends essentially on\r\nthe nature and extent of the loss which parts are reproduced by the\r\nregenerating cells, and, also, on the position and direction of the\r\ninjured surface from which the regeneration starts. The influences,\r\nstill quite beyond our comprehension, which are exerted on the\r\nregenerating part by the uninjured parts constitute the liberating\r\nstimuli, which evoke the activity of one or other of the determinants\r\ncontained in the regeneration-idioplasm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100. Regeneration of Planarians. _A_, an animal\r\ndivided into three parts by two oblique cuts. _B_, the fragments(_a_,\r\n_b_, _c_) in process of regeneration. _C_, an animal with various\r\noblique incisions in the margin of the body, which have induced the new\r\nformation of heads (_k_), of tails (_s_), and pharynx (_ph_). _A_ and\r\n_B_ after Morgan; _C_ after Walter Voigt.]\r\n\r\nWalter Voigt has shown, by a series of most interesting experiments,\r\nthat it is possible not only to cause the development of a new head\r\nin Planarians by cutting them, in which case a tail may grow from the\r\nanterior portion and a head from the posterior portion, but it is\r\nalso possible in an intact animal, that is, one with both head and\r\ntail, to cause the production of a second head, or a second tail, or\r\nboth at once, at any part of the body margin at will, according to\r\nthe direction of the cut. If the margin of the body be cut obliquely\r\nforwards (Fig. 100, _A_) a supernumerary tail arises (_C_, _s_), if\r\nit be cut obliquely backwards a supernumerary head arises (_C_, _k_),\r\nand in this way several heads and several tails may be produced in\r\nthe same animal. It is obvious, then, that the interaction, in the\r\nfirst place, of the cells of the cut surface, but probably also of the\r\ndeeper-lying cells, decides which determinants are to come into action,\r\nthose of the head or those of the tail, but both must be present at\r\nevery part of the cut. How far below the cut surface the cells take\r\npart in this determination we cannot make out, but that it cannot be\r\ndue to the co-operation of all parts is clear in this case at least,\r\nsince the animal still possesses its original head and tail. The extra\r\nheads and tails thus produced prove, at any rate, that there can be no\r\nquestion here of the expression of an adaptive principle, a _spiritus\r\nrector_, or a vital force, which always creates what is good, but that\r\nit is rather a purely mechanical process, which takes its course quite\r\nindependently of what is useful or disadvantageous, and that it must\r\ntake this course according to the given regeneration-mechanism and the\r\nstimulus supplied in the special case. It cannot be supposed that these\r\nsupernumerary heads and tails are purposeful, but who would expect an\r\nadaptive reaction from the animal in a case like this, since cuts of\r\nthe kind which we make artificially, and _must keep open artificially_\r\nif the deformities are to develop, hardly occur in nature, and, if they\r\ndid occur, would very quickly close up again? Adaptations can only\r\ndevelop in response to conditions which occur and recur in a majority\r\nof cases, and when they have a useful, that is, species-preserving\r\nresult. The adaptiveness of the organism is blind, it does not see the\r\nindividual case, it only takes into account the cases in the mass,\r\nand acts as it must after the mechanism has once been evolved. The\r\ncase is the same as that of 'aberrant' or mistaken instincts, whose\r\norigin by means of selection is the more clearly proved, since we must\r\nrecognize such an instinct as a pure mechanism and not as the outcome\r\nof purposeful forces.\r\n\r\nIn the regeneration of Planarians we must think of the\r\nregeneration-idioplasm as containing the full complex of the\r\ncollective determinants of the three germinal layers, and possibly\r\nwe must add to this cells with the complete germ-plasm for giving\r\nrise to the reproductive cells. But when the amputated tail of the\r\nnewt is regenerated, or its leg, or the arm of a starfish, or the\r\nbill of a bird, we have no ground for assuming that the cells, from\r\nwhich regeneration starts, contain the whole germ-plasm, since the\r\ndeterminants of the replaceable parts suffice to explain the facts.\r\nWe must even dispute the possibility of the presence of the whole\r\ngerm-plasm in this case, because the faculty of regeneration of the\r\nrelevant cells is really no longer a general one, but is limited to\r\nthe reproduction of a particular part. This is seen in the fact that,\r\nin the starfish, whose high regenerative capacity is well known, the\r\ncentral disk of the body may indeed give rise to new arms[2]; but\r\nan excised arm, to which no part of the disk adheres, is in most\r\nstarfishes unable to give rise to the body. Thus the arm does not\r\ncontain in its cells the determinants of the disk, but the latter\r\ncontains those of the arm. We are not surprised that the amputated\r\ntail of the salamander does not reproduce the whole animal, but this\r\ncan only be because the impelling forces to the regeneration of the\r\nwhole animal are wanting, that is, that the cut surface only contains\r\nthe determinants of the tail and not the complete germ-plasm. It might\r\nbe objected here that the tail-piece is too small to give rise to the\r\nwhole body, but in _Planaria_ it is only very diminutive heads and\r\ntails which grow from the artificial incisions, and the same is true\r\nof starfishes when only a single arm and a small piece of the disk\r\nhave been left. Notwithstanding the small amount of living substance\r\nat their disposal, and although they are at first unable to take\r\nnourishment, they send out very small new arms (Fig. 101), close up the\r\nwounded surface, and, after reconstruction of the mouth and stomach,\r\nbegin to feed anew. The new arms may then grow to the normal size.\r\n\r\n[2] I see now that there are contradictory statements in regard to this\r\ncase. Possibly these depend on the different behaviour of different\r\nspecies, and this on the varying frequency of mutilation. Starfishes\r\nwhich live on the shore between the rocks, for instance on the movable\r\nstones of a breakwater, are very frequently mutilated; in some places\r\nit is rare to find a specimen without traces of former wounds. H. D.\r\nKing counted among 1,914 specimens of _Asterias vulgaris_ 206 in the\r\nact of regenerating a part, that is, 10.76 per cent. In the case of\r\nthe starfishes from deep water this cause of injury does not of course\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101. A starfish arm, growing four new arms; the\r\nso-called 'comet-form.' After Haeckel.]\r\n\r\nWe must therefore assume that, in many cases, the\r\nregeneration-primordium consists of cells which only contain a definite\r\ncomplex of determinants in the form of latent regeneration-idioplasm,\r\nas, for instance, certain cells of the tail of Triton contain the\r\ndeterminants of the tail, certain cells of its leg the determinants of\r\nthe leg, and so on. In many cases we can speak even more precisely,\r\nand determine from which cells the nerve-centres, from which the\r\nmuscles, and from which the missing section of the food-canal will be\r\nformed, as was recently shown by Franz von Wagner in regard to the worm\r\n_Lumbriculus_, whose regenerative capacity is so extraordinarily high.\r\nWe must then attribute to each of the relevant cells an equipment of\r\nregeneration-idioplasm, which includes only the relevant complex of\r\ndeterminants.\r\n\r\nI need not here go further into detail, but I should still like to\r\nshow that, in reality, as I assumed in regard to the regenerative\r\ncapacity of a part, the root of the regeneration-idioplasm lies\r\nin the germ-plasm, that it is present there as an independent\r\ndeterminant-group, and, like every other bodily rudiment (_Anlage_),\r\nmust be handed on from generation to generation. This assumption is\r\nnecessary, as has been already indicated, on the ground that the\r\nfaculty of regeneration is hereditary, and hereditarily variable, on\r\nthe same ground, therefore, as that on which the whole determinant\r\ntheory is based. The regeneration-determinants must be contained _as\r\nsuch_ in the germ-plasm, otherwise a twofold phyletic development could\r\nnot have occurred, as it actually has, in many parts. The tail of the\r\nlizard is adapted for autotomy; it breaks off when it is held by the\r\ntip, and this depends on a special adaptation of the vertebræ, which\r\nare very brittle in a definite plane from the seventh onwards. This is\r\nthus a very effective adaptation to persecution by enemies. The tail\r\nwhich has been seized remains with the pursuer, but the lizard itself\r\nescapes, and the tail grows again. But this regeneration does not take\r\nplace in the same way as in the embryo; no new vertebræ are formed,\r\nbut only a 'cartilaginous-tube,' a new structure, a substitute for the\r\nvertebral column; the spinal cord with its nerves is not regenerated\r\neither, and the arrangement of the scales is somewhat different.\r\n\r\nThis last point, in particular, indicates that the determinants of\r\nthe regeneration-rudiment may pursue an independent phylogenetic path\r\nof their own, for this scale arrangement of the regenerated tail\r\nis an atavistic one, that is, it corresponds to a more primitive\r\nmode of scale arrangement in these Saurians. We know quite a number\r\nof cases similar to this. It not infrequently happens that cut-off\r\nparts regenerate, but that they do so not in the modern form, but in\r\none that is in all probability phyletically older. Thus the legs of\r\nvarious Orthoptera, as of the cockroaches and grasshoppers, regenerate\r\nreadily, but with a tarsus composed of four joints instead of five[3],\r\nand the long-fingered claws of a shrimp (_Atyoida potimirim_) is\r\nreplaced by the older short-fingered type of claw, while in the\r\nAxolotl an atavistic five-fingered hand grows instead of the amputated\r\nfour-fingered one.\r\n\r\n[3] New investigations, specially directed to this point, by\r\nR. Godelmann, have shown that 'in the great majority of cases'\r\nthe regenerated legs of a Phasmid (_Bacillus rossii_) exhibit a\r\nfour-jointed tarsus; but the regeneration of five joints also occurs,\r\nthough only after autotomy, and only in seven out of fifty cases\r\n(_Archiv für Entwicklungsmechanik_, Bd. xii, Heft 2, July 1901).\r\nThe regeneration-rudiment in this species seems to be in process of\r\nadvancing slowly to the five-jointed type.\r\n\r\nThis last case shows that it is not merely a lesser power of growth\r\nthat accounts for the difference between the regenerated part and\r\nthe original, for here more is regenerated than was previously\r\npresent. There remains nothing for it but the assumption that the\r\nregeneration-determinants have remained at a lower phyletic level,\r\nwhile the determinants which direct embryogenesis have varied, and\r\neither developed further or retrogressed. It is easy to understand that\r\nthe regeneration-rudiment must vary phyletically much more slowly\r\nthan the parts which evolved in the ordinary way and much more slowly\r\nthan the determinants of these parts, for natural selection means a\r\nselection of the fittest, and the speed with which the establishment\r\nof a variation is attained depends, _ceteris paribus_, on the number\r\nof individuals that are exposed to selection with respect to the\r\nvarying part. If in a species of a million living at the same time\r\nnine-tenths perish by accident, there will remain only 100,000 from\r\nwhich to select the 1,000 which we will assume constitute the normal\r\nnumber of the species. The more of these 100,000 which possess the\r\nuseful variation the higher will be the percentage of the normally\r\nsurviving 1,000 possessing it, and the more rapidly will the useful\r\nvariation increase. But when it is a question of the variation of\r\nthe regeneration-primordium, the selection will take place not among\r\nall the 100,000 individuals which chance has spared, but only among\r\nthose of them which have lost a limb by accident, and thus are in\r\na position to regenerate it more or less completely. If we assume\r\nthat this takes place in 10 per cent. of cases, then selection for\r\nthe improvement of the regeneration-apparatus will only take place\r\namong 1,000 individuals, and thus the process of modification of the\r\nregeneration-primordium must go on very much more slowly than that of\r\nthe limb itself.\r\n\r\nI do not see how the opponents of the germ-plasm theory can explain\r\nthese facts at all, for the appeal to external influences is here\r\nentirely futile, and that to internal liberating stimuli does not\r\nsuffice, since these must be different after a part has been cut\r\noff from what they were when the limb developed normally, and also\r\ndifferent from those which prevailed at the normal origin of the\r\nlimb in ancestral forms. The four-jointed tarsus of the ancestors\r\nof our cockroaches did not arise as a result of amputation. We\r\ncannot therefore avoid referring the processes of regeneration to\r\nparticular 'regeneration-determinants,' which are contained in the\r\ngerm-plasm and are handed on in ontogeny with the other determinants\r\nfrom cell-division to cell-division, till ultimately they reach the\r\ncells which are to respond, or may have to respond, to the stimulus\r\nof injury by some expression of their regenerative capacity. As these\r\ndeterminants, as has been shown, can often only be very slightly\r\nsubject to the influence of selection processes, they will, in many\r\nrespects, lag behind in the phyletic development, and will tend to\r\nbelong to an ancestral type of the relevant part. They will often\r\nremain for a long time at this ancestral level, and they will always\r\nadapt themselves to new requirements more slowly than the parts which\r\narise in the normal way, and the determinants representing these in\r\nthe germ. But the regeneration-determinants _are_ variable, and,\r\nindeed, are so hereditarily, and independently of the structure of the\r\nnormal parts. They thus follow their own path of phyletic development,\r\nand this one fact is enough to secure a preference for the germ-plasm\r\ntheory above others that have hitherto been suggested. None of these\r\nhas even attempted an explanation of this fact; the tendency has rather\r\nbeen to call it in question. This, however, can be done at most only in\r\nregard to the explanation of the regenerations as atavistic, certainly\r\nnot in regard to the progressive variations of the regenerated part,\r\nsuch as have been established by Leydig and Fraisse in regard to the\r\nlizard's tail. It may be doubted whether the most primitive insects had\r\nonly four tarsal joints, but there is no disputing the kainogenetic\r\ndeviation of the lizard's-tail.\r\n\r\nI have interpreted the regenerative capacity as secondary and acquired,\r\nnot as a primary power of all living substance, and I should like to\r\nsubstantiate this in another way.\r\n\r\nLet us go back to the simplest organism conceivable, which must have\r\nrepresented the beginning of life on our earth, and we see that this\r\nneed not have possessed any special power of regeneration, because, for\r\nan organism without differentiation of parts, growth is equivalent to\r\nregeneration. But growth is the direct outcome of one of the primary\r\ncharacters of the living substance, the capacity of assimilation.\r\nThis cannot be an adaptive phenomenon, nor can it have arisen through\r\nselection, because selection presupposes reproduction, and reproduction\r\nis only a periodic form of growth; but growth follows directly from\r\nassimilation. The fundamental characters of the living substance, above\r\nall the dissimilation and assimilation which condition metabolism, must\r\nhave been in existence from the first when living substance arose,\r\nand must depend on its unique chemico-physical composition. But the\r\nfaculty of regeneration could only be acquired when organisms became\r\nqualitatively differentiated, so that each part was no longer like\r\nevery other part or like the whole. As soon as this stage was reached\r\nthe faculty of regeneration would necessarily be developed, if further\r\nmultiplication was to take place. For when each fragment could no\r\nlonger become a whole by simply growing, some arrangement had to be\r\nmade by which each fragment should receive, in the form of primary\r\nconstituents, what it lacked to make up the whole. We do not know the\r\nfirst beginning of this adaptation, but, in its further development,\r\nit appears in the form of 'nuclear substance,' enclosed in the nucleus\r\nof the cell, and, as is well known, it is now to be found in all\r\nunicellular organisms. That the nucleus there precedes regeneration\r\nin the sense that without a piece of it the cell-soma is not able to\r\ncomplete itself alone, we have already seen, and the explanation of\r\nthis fact has always seemed to me to be that invisibly minute vital\r\nunits relating to the regeneration of the injured part leave the\r\nnucleus and evoke the development of the missing parts by laws and\r\nforces still unknown to us. Loeb has recently claimed that the nucleus\r\nis the cell's organ of oxidation; but if that be true it would still\r\nnot exclude the possibility that the nucleus is also and primarily\r\na storehouse of the material bearers of the primary constituents\r\nof a species. It must be regarded as such when we call to mind the\r\nphenomena of amphimixis in its twofold aspects as conjugation and as\r\nfertilization, and its obvious outcome among higher organisms where it\r\nimplies the mingling of the parental qualities.\r\n\r\nThus the 'nuclear substance' of unicellular organisms is for us the\r\nfirst demonstrable organ of regeneration, and first of all for normal\r\nregeneration, which takes place at every reproduction, for instance,\r\nof an Infusorian. For we have already seen that, in the transverse\r\ndivision of a trumpet animalcule (_Stentor_), the anterior part must\r\ndevelop the posterior half anew, while the posterior half must develop\r\nthe much more complex anterior half, with mouth region and spiral\r\nbands of cilia. But as soon as the arrangement for normal reproduction\r\nwas elaborated, as soon as the nucleus was present, as a depôt of\r\n'primary constituents,' this implied the possibility of regeneration\r\nin exceptional cases, that is, after injury. The mechanism was already\r\nthere, and it came into operation as soon as a part of the animal was\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nIt is in the first nucleus, therefore, that we have to look for\r\nthe source of all regenerative capacity, both in unicellular and\r\nmulticellular organisms. But with the origin of the latter a limitation\r\ntook place, either quite at the beginning or a little later, for each\r\nnucleus of the cell-colony no longer contained the whole complex of\r\n'primary constituents' or determinants of the species, but, in many\r\ncases, only the reproductive cell possessed them. As soon as this began\r\nto develop into a whole by cell-division the determinant-complex was\r\nsegregated. Thus the first cell-colonies with two kinds of cells arose,\r\nas we have seen in the case of _Volvox_--the reproductive cells with a\r\ncomplete equipment for regeneration in their nucleus, and the somatic\r\ncells with a limited equipment for regeneration in their nuclei. The\r\nsomatic cell could no longer give rise anew to the whole organism, but\r\ncould only reproduce itself or its like.\r\n\r\nBut as many of the lower Metazoa and Metaphyta possess _the power of\r\nbudding_, that is, are able not only to produce a new individual\r\nfrom definite cells--the reproductive cells--with or without sexual\r\ndifferentiation, but from other cell-groups also, these must contain\r\nthe whole complex of determinants appertaining to the reconstruction\r\nof the organism, and we have to ask how this is reconcilable with the\r\ndifferentiation of a multicellular organism, whose different kinds of\r\ncells depend, according to our interpretation, on the fact that they\r\nare controlled by different determinants.\r\n\r\nObviously, there is only one way out of this difficulty, and it is the\r\none we have already indicated, that although the diffuse regenerative\r\ncapacity which we have just alluded to occurs in species which exhibit\r\ngemmation, this does not exclude the control of a cell by a specific\r\ndeterminant; other determinants may be contained in the cell, in a\r\nstate, however, in which they do not affect it, that is, in an inactive\r\nor latent state.\r\n\r\nThus we arrive in this way also at our earlier assumption that an\r\ninactive accessory-idioplasm is given to all, or at least to many\r\ncell-generations. Only among plants must this necessarily be complete\r\ngerm-plasm, and among the lower plant-forms, as in _Caulerpa_ among\r\nthe Algæ, in _Marchantia_ among Liverworts, it must be assumed to\r\nbe present in nearly all the cells, according to the experiments\r\nin regeneration made by Reinke and Vöchting. But in multicellular\r\nanimals which develop from two different germinal layers equipped\r\nwith a different complex of determinants budding arises from a\r\ncombination of at least two different kinds of cells, and we must\r\nonly ascribe to each of these its own peculiar determinant-complex as\r\nregeneration-idioplasm. Higher plants show us that well-marked power\r\nof budding is not necessarily associated with a high regenerative\r\ncapacity, the histologically specialized cells among them will contain\r\nno inactive germ-plasm, because they do not need it. But in animals the\r\npower of budding is probably always combined with high regenerative\r\ncapacity, as is shown by the Polyps and Medusoids above all, and in a\r\ndifferent way by the Ctenophores, which exhibit no budding and at the\r\nsame time a very slight regenerative capacity, although they possess\r\nan organization scarcely higher than that of the Hydromedusæ. In the\r\nCtenophores each of the first segmentation-cells, when artificially\r\nseparated, yields only a half-embryo, and we may conclude from this\r\nthat it contains no complete germ-plasm in an inactive state, or at\r\nleast very little, and certainly not a sufficient quantity to make it\r\nreadily regenerative.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, however, the regenerative capacity occurs apart from the\r\ncapacity for budding, yet this in no way contradicts the theory. As\r\nwe have seen, a high regenerative capacity is to be found among many\r\nanimals which occur only as 'persons' and not as colonies or stocks,\r\nbut only in those which are readily liable to injury, and only in\r\nthe manner conditioned by their injury. In the higher Metazoa the\r\nregenerative power becomes more and more limited, and in the Mammals it\r\nsinks to a mere closing up of wounds.\r\n\r\nIf we take a survey of the assumptions we have been compelled to\r\nmake from the standpoint of the theory to explain the development of\r\ngerm-cells, budding, and regeneration, it would seem as if it were\r\ncontradictory to assume that, on the one hand, complete germ-plasm\r\nshould be given to certain cell-series as inactive accessory idioplasm,\r\nand, on the other, that very numerous cells, at least in the lower\r\nMetazoa, should have received the idioplasm of budding, and still\r\nmore numerous cells that of regeneration. But it is obvious that\r\namong the lower Metazoa the idioplasm of budding and the idioplasm of\r\nregeneration are equivalent; the same idioplasm, which, when liberated\r\nby stimuli unknown to us, co-operates from two or three germinal layers\r\nin the formation of a bud, effects, in response to the known stimulus\r\nof injury, the regeneration of the mutilated part. But germ-cells\r\ncan never arise in the Metazoa from the partial budding-idioplasm or\r\nregeneration-idioplasm, because this is not complete germ-plasm, and\r\nbecause it can only give rise to budding or regeneration through the\r\nco-operation of two or more kinds of cells, while germ-cells always\r\noriginate from _one_ cell and never arise from the fusion of cells.\r\nGerm-cells can thus only arise from the cells of the germ-track, and\r\nin no other way, no matter whether the germ-track lie in the ectoderm,\r\nas in the Hydromedusæ, or in the endoderm, as in true jellyfishes\r\n(Acalephæ) and the Ctenophores, or in the mesoderm, as in many higher\r\ngroups of animals. It is only apparently that these cells belong to\r\none particular layer, for in reality they are unique in kind, and they\r\nare simply assisted in their development by one or other cell-layer,\r\nfrom which they not infrequently emancipate themselves, as happens\r\nso notably in the Hydromedusæ. As we have already said, it is only\r\namong plants that we must think of budding as arising from cells which\r\ncontain complete germ-plasm, for here there are no 'germinal layers'\r\ncorresponding to those of animal development, and the cells of 'the\r\ngrowing point' must be equipped with the complete germ-plasm. The\r\nplant, like the Hydroid stock and the Siphonophore colony, is saved\r\nfrom death, in spite of the frequent loss of its members, mainly by\r\nthe fact that it is capable of producing, at almost any part above the\r\nground, buds which develop into new shoots, with leaves and the like.\r\nThis makes a power of regeneration on the part of the individual leaves\r\nand flower-parts superfluous, but at the same time it implies that an\r\nenormous number of cells must be distributed over the whole surface\r\nof the plant, each of which can in certain circumstances become the\r\nstarting-point of a bud. That is to say, each must contain, in a latent\r\nstate, the complete germ-plasm which is necessary for the production of\r\nan entire plant.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore assume that, in the higher colony-forming plants,\r\ngerm-plasm is contained in a great many cells, perhaps in all which\r\nare not histologically differentiated, and sometimes even in those\r\nwhich are so, as, for instance, in the leaves of Begonias. I suppose,\r\ntherefore, that in the higher plants the process of development implies\r\na segregation of the determinant-complexes of the germ-plasm, but that\r\nthis takes place at a late stage, and that in a much higher degree than\r\namong animals the individual or the 'person' carries with it germ-plasm\r\nin a latent state. To this must be attributed the fact that the plant\r\nis not only able to make good its losses in twigs and branches by\r\nsending out new shoots, but that cuttings, that is, detached shoots,\r\nare also able to take root, and in general to give rise to what is\r\nnecessary to complete themselves according to the position of the part\r\nin question. In the ontogeny of animals, too, we must assume that it\r\nrequires a liberating stimulus to rouse the determinants to activity,\r\nthat this stimulus is to be sought for in the influence exercised by\r\nthe constitution of the cell on the idioplasm contained within it,\r\nand that this constitution in its turn is subject to influences from\r\nexternal conditions, including the cell-soma itself. We may therefore\r\nsuppose that, among plants also, the germ-plasm latent in numerous\r\ncells only becomes active in whole or in part according to the\r\ninfluences exerted on it by the state of the cell at the moment; but\r\nthis varies with external circumstances, according to whether the cell\r\nis exposed to light or lies under ground, according as it is influenced\r\nby gravity, by moisture, chemical stimuli, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt might be objected to this that it would be simpler not to assume\r\na segregation of the germ-plasm into determinant-complexes at all in\r\norder to explain the process of development, but rather to credit each\r\ncell with a complete equipment of germ-plasm from the beginning to the\r\nend of the ontogeny, and to attribute the differences in the cells,\r\nwhich condition the structure of the plant and its differentiation,\r\nsolely to the different influences, external and internal, to which\r\nthe cell is exposed, and which rouse some determinants to activity at\r\none part and others at another. Perhaps the botanists would be more\r\nreadily reconciled to this idea, but it seems to me that there are two\r\npoints which tell against the possibility of its being correct. In the\r\nfirst place, it is far from being established that every cell in the\r\nhigher plants is capable of giving rise, under favourable conditions,\r\nto a whole new plant; every tree and every higher plant has a multitude\r\nof cells in its leaves, its flowers, and so on, which cannot do this,\r\nwhich are in fact differentiated in one particular direction, that is,\r\nthey contain only one kind of determinants, like the histologically\r\ndifferentiated cells of the tissues of the human body. Secondly,\r\nthere are other organisms besides plants, and a theory of development\r\ncannot be based on the phenomena to be observed among plants alone,\r\nany more than a theory of heredity can. There are obvious differences\r\nin the processes of life among plants as contrasted with those among\r\nanimals, but it is improbable that there is any thoroughly fundamental\r\ndifference. It is, however, indubitable that the cells forming the\r\ntissues of higher animals, the nerve, muscle, and glandular cells,\r\nare really differentiated in one direction, and are quite incapable,\r\nunder any circumstances whatever, of growing into an entire organism,\r\nand even from this alone we might conclude that they contain only one\r\nprimordium or determinant. Are we then to assume that the vascular\r\ncells, epidermis-cells, wood-cells, and so on, of the higher plants,\r\nwhich are also differentiated in one direction, do nevertheless contain\r\nthe complete germ-plasm? I do not see any ground for such an assumption.\r\n\r\nTo conclude what can be said on the subject of regeneration we must\r\nreturn to the question of an ultimate explanation of this marvellous\r\nphenomenon. I have declined to attempt any explanation at all, because\r\nI do not consider it possible to give a sufficient one as yet, but I\r\nshould like at least to give an indication as to the direction in which\r\nwe must look for it.\r\n\r\nWe assumed that there is a regeneration-idioplasm, and therefore that\r\nthere are 'primary constituents' at certain positions in the body,\r\nbut how does it happen that these are able to build up the lost parts\r\nin the proper situation and detail? A theoretical formula might well\r\nbe thought out, according to which the determinants of successive\r\nparts would become active successively, and would thus liberate one\r\nanother in an appropriate order of sequence, but there would not be\r\nmuch gained by this, especially as what we already know in regard to\r\nthe regrowth of the legs and toes in Triton does not harmonize with\r\nsuch an assumption. It appears to me more important--though even here\r\nwe must still be very vague as to details--to recognize that, in all\r\nvital units, there are forces at work which we do not yet know clearly,\r\nwhich bind the parts of each unit to one another in a particular order\r\nand relation. We were obliged to assume such forces even in regard\r\nto the lowest units, the biophors, since otherwise they could not be\r\ncapable of multiplication by division, on which all organic growth\r\ndepends, unless we are to assume, as Nägeli did, a continual _generatio\r\næquivoca_ of the specific kinds of biophors (his 'micellæ'). But we\r\nshall see later, when we come to speak of spontaneous generation, that\r\nwe cannot acquiesce in such an assumption. If, then, we cannot conceive\r\nof a power of division arising from within and depending solely on\r\ngrowth by means of assimilation, without such attractive and repellent\r\nforces or 'vital affinities' the internal parts would necessarily fall\r\ninto disorder at every division. It seems to me therefore that such\r\n'affinities' must be operative at _all stages_ in the life of the vital\r\nunits, not only in biophors, but also in the cell, and in the 'person'\r\nas well as in determinant and id. It is true that 'persons' no longer\r\ngenerally possess the power of multiplying by division, but in plants\r\nand lower animals many do possess it; and the power of giving rise\r\nanew to certain parts is obviously a part of that power of doubling\r\nthe whole by division. The ultimate roots of regeneration, then, must\r\nlie in these 'affinities' between the parts, which preside over their\r\narrangement and are able to maintain it and to give rise to it anew.\r\nIn this respect the organism appears to us like a crystal whose broken\r\npoints always complete themselves again from the mother-lye after\r\nthe same system of crystallization, obviously in this case too as a\r\nresult of certain internal directive forces, polarities, which here\r\nagain we are unable precisely to define. But the difference between\r\nthe organism and the crystal does not--as people have been hitherto\r\ninclined to believe--lie only in the fact that the crystal requires the\r\nmother-lye to complete itself, while the vital unit itself procures the\r\nmaterial for its further growth; it lies also in the fact that such\r\nregeneration is not possible in every organism and at every place, but\r\nthat _special_ 'primary constituents' are necessary, without which the\r\nrelevant part cannot arise. The indispensableness of these primary\r\nconstituents, the determinants, seems to me to depend on the fact\r\nthat the new structure cannot be built up simply by procuring organic\r\nmaterial, but _that specially hewn stones, different in every case,\r\nare necessary_, which can only be supplied in virtue of an historical\r\ntransmission, or, to abandon the metaphor, because the vital units of\r\nwhich the organ is to be reconstructed possess a specific character\r\nand have a long history behind them; thus they can only arise from\r\nsuch vital units as have been handed on through generations, that is,\r\nfrom the determinants. But these primary constituents are given to the\r\ndifferent forms of life in very varying degrees and in very unequal\r\ndistribution, and as far as we can see according to their suitability\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXII\r\n\r\nSHARE OF THE PARENTS IN THE BUILDING UP OF THE OFFSPRING\r\n\r\n The ids are 'ancestral plasms'--The reducing division brings\r\n about a diversity of germ-plasm in the germ-cells--Bolles\r\n Lee's 'Neotaxis' even in the primordial germ-cells--Häcker's\r\n observations on the persistent distinctness of the maternal and\r\n paternal chromosomes--Identical twins--The individuality is\r\n determined at fertilization--Unequal share of the ids in the\r\n determination of the offspring--Preponderance of one parent in the\r\n composition of the offspring--Certain ids of the ancestors remain\r\n unchanged in the germ-plasm of the descendants--Struggle of the\r\n Biophors--Alternation of the hereditary sequences in the parts\r\n of the child--Reversion--Datura-hybrids--Zebra-striping in the\r\n horse--Three-toed horses--New experiments in hybridization among\r\n plants by Correns and De Vries--Xenia.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as the phenomena of regeneration and budding are concerned, we\r\nhave not been able to do much more than bring them under a formula,\r\nwhich harmonizes with the germ-plasm theory. But the case is different\r\nwith the actual phenomena of inheritance in the restricted sense, for\r\ninstance, with regard to the transmission of individual peculiarities\r\n_from parent to child_. Here the theory really increases our insight\r\nand lets us penetrate deeper into the causes of the phenomena; it is\r\nhere no longer a mere 'portmanteau-theory.'\r\n\r\nWe are well aware, especially from observation on ourselves, that is,\r\non Man, that the children of a pair often resemble one another but\r\nare never alike, and that one child frequently resembles one parent,\r\nanother the other, while a third may exhibit a mingling of both\r\nparents. How does this come about? Since the germinal substance of both\r\nparents is derived from that of the ovum, from which they themselves\r\nhave arisen--and must therefore be the same in all the germ-cells\r\nto which they give rise--new determinants cannot be added, and old\r\nones cannot be dropped out, and variation of the determinants, the\r\npossibility of which is granted, would still not directly bring about\r\nthe familiar mingling of resemblances to the two parents, but would at\r\nmost give rise to something new and strange.\r\n\r\nHere the theory helps to elucidate matters. We found ourselves obliged\r\nto assume that the germ-plasm is composed of ids, that is, of\r\nequivalent portions of germ-plasm, each of which contains all the kinds\r\nof determinants appertaining to the building up of an individual, but\r\neach of these kinds in a particular individual form. I have already\r\ncalled these ids 'ancestral plasms,' and the term is appropriate, in\r\nso far that in every fertilization an equal number of ids from the\r\nfather and from the mother are united in the ovum, so that the child\r\nis built up of the ids of his two nearest 'ancestors.' But as the ids\r\nof the parents are derived from those of the grandparents, and these\r\nagain from those of the great-grandparents, the ids are in truth the\r\nidioplasm of the ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe expression, however, has been very frequently misunderstood, as\r\nif it were intended to mean that the ids retained _unchanged_ for all\r\ntime the character of their respective ancestors, and I have even\r\nbeen credited with supposing that our own ids still consist of the\r\ndeterminant-complexes of our fish-like or even Amœba-like ancestors.\r\nBut in reality no id exactly or completely corresponds to the type,\r\nthat is, to the whole being of any one of the ancestors in whose\r\ngerm-plasm it was formerly contained, for each of the ancestors had\r\nmany ids in his germ-plasm, and his entire constitution was not\r\ndetermined by any one of these alone, but by the co-operation of them\r\nall. The individual arising from a germ-cell must necessarily be the\r\nresult of all the ids which make up his germ-plasm, but undoubtedly the\r\nshare taken by some of them may be much stronger than that taken by\r\nothers. It is also clear that, if we leave out of account any possible\r\nvariation on the part of the ids, each of them belongs, not to one\r\nancestor only, but to a whole series of ancestors, and must have taken\r\npart in their development, so that it is not the idioplasm of any\r\nparticular ancestor, but only ancestral plasm in the general sense. In\r\nthis sense we may quite well retain the designation, 'ancestral plasm,'\r\nfor the id.\r\n\r\nThus, according to our view, the germ-plasm consists of ids, each of\r\nwhich contains all the determinants of the whole ontogeny, but usually\r\nin individually different quality.\r\n\r\nReturning for a moment to the processes by which the reduction of the\r\nchromosomes, that is, of the nuclear rods of germ-plasm in the ovum\r\nand sperm-cell is brought about, we recall the fact that this happens\r\nat the last two divisions of the germ-cell, the so-called 'maturing\r\ndivisions.' In these the nuclear substance, as we have seen, is\r\ndivided between the two daughter-nuclei in a manner quite different\r\nfrom the usual one, for a longitudinal splitting of the rods, bands,\r\nor spheres in the equatorial plane of the nucleus does not take\r\nplace, but half the number of rods move into the right and half into\r\nthe left daughter-nucleus without previous division, so that in each\r\ndaughter-nucleus the number of rods is reduced to half (Fig. 76).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76. Diagram of the maturation divisions of the\r\novum. _A_, primitive germ-cell. _B_, mother-egg-cell, which has grown\r\nand has doubled the number of its chromosomes. _C_, first maturation\r\ndivision. _D_, immediately thereafter; _Rk_ 1, the first directive cell\r\nor polar body. _E_, the second maturation spindle has been formed; the\r\nfirst polar body has divided into two (2 and 3); the four chromosomes\r\nremaining in the ovum lie in the second directive spindle. _F_,\r\nimmediately after the second maturation division; 1, the mature ovum;\r\n2, 3, and 4, the three polar cells, each of these four cells containing\r\ntwo chromosomes.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the distribution of the rods in this manner takes place twice\r\nin succession, the normal number is not, as we have already seen,\r\nreduced to a quarter, because, long before the occurrence of the first\r\nmaturing division, a duplication of the rods by means of longitudinal\r\ndivision had taken place, and thus the first division differs from an\r\nordinary division in that the splitting of the rods does not take place\r\nduring the process of dividing but long beforehand. Only the second\r\nmaturing division differs from all other nuclear divisions known to\r\nus, since it is not associated with any splitting of the rods at all,\r\nbut conveys half of the existing rods into each daughter-nucleus. It\r\nis the time reducing division, through which the number of the rods is\r\nreduced to one half[4].\r\n\r\n[4] Recent investigations have shown that the reduction of the\r\nchromosomes does not always take place exactly in accordance with the\r\nscheme here indicated, but that it differs from it in many cases. But\r\nas investigations on this point are as yet by no means complete, I need\r\nnot go into the question further; the ultimate result is the same in\r\nany case.\r\n\r\nThis numerical reduction must, however, have other consequences; it\r\nmust make the germ-cells of the same individual qualitatively unlike,\r\nthat is, in relation to their value in inheritance. Let us assume only\r\nfour chromosomes of the rod-form ('idants') as the nuclear elements\r\nof a species, two of which, _A_ and _B_, come from the mother, and\r\nother two, _C_ and _D_, from the father, the last maturing division\r\nmay, as far as we can see, result either in removing the combination\r\n_A_ and _B_ from _C_ and _D_, or _A_ and _C_ from _B_ and _D_, or _A_\r\nand _D_ from _B_ and _C_; there is thus a possibility of one of six\r\ndifferent combinations of rods in any one germ-cell. What is the same\r\nthing, six different kinds of germ-cells differing in their hereditary\r\nprimary constituents may _be developed in the same_ individual. As this\r\nnew combination, or, as we may call it, neotaxis of the germ-plasm\r\nelements, takes place in female as well as in male individuals, there\r\nis a possibility that, in fertilization, 6 × 6 = 36 individuals with\r\ndifferent primary constituents may arise from the germ-cells of the\r\nsame two parents. Of course the number of possible combinations\r\nincreases very considerably in proportion to the normal number of\r\nrods, for with eight of these it comes up to 70, and with sixteen to\r\n12,870; the number of individuals differing in their inherited primary\r\nconstituents would thus be enormous, for each of the 70 or of the\r\n12,870 different hereditary minglings of the ovum could combine in\r\namphimixis with 70 or 12,870 different sperm-cells, so that 70 × 70\r\nand 12,870 × 12,870 offspring individually different in their primary\r\nconstituents might arise from the same two parents. In Man there are\r\nsaid to be sixteen nuclear rods; so that in his case the last-mentioned\r\nnumber of parental hereditary minglings might occur. This may seem a\r\ndisproportionately high number as compared with the small number of\r\nchildren of a human pair, but we must not judge from the case of Man\r\nalone, and in plants and animals, which we have already discussed, the\r\nnumber of descendants is very much larger, and is often enormous. We\r\nsaw what significance this apparent extravagance on the part of nature\r\nhas, for without it adaptation to changed conditions of life would\r\nnot be possible, since, if only so many were born as could attain to\r\nreproduction, no selection of the fittest could take place. The same\r\nwould be the case if all the young of a species were alike, and even if\r\nall the descendants of a single pair were alike, effective selection\r\nwould be excluded, since only as many individualities could be selected\r\nas there were pairs of parents. It is easy to understand that selection\r\nworks more effectively the larger the number of descendants of a\r\nspecies and the more they differ from each other. The chance that the\r\nbest possible combination of characters will occur is thereby increased.\r\n\r\nAlthough we cannot calculate how many individuals of different\r\ncombinations of characters natural selection requires to work upon in\r\norder to direct the evolution of the species[5], we can understand\r\nthat only as large a choice as possible can secure that the best\r\npossible adaptations of all parts and organs are brought about and\r\nmaintained. Precisely in the fact that in every generation such an\r\nenormous superfluity of individuals is produced lies the possibility\r\nof such intensive processes of selection as must continually take\r\nplace, if the adaptation of all parts is to be explained. For if among\r\nthe thousands of descendants of a fertile species each hundred were\r\nalike among themselves, these hundreds would have, as far as natural\r\nselection was concerned, only the value of a single variant. But such\r\nan all-round adaptation as actually exists in the structure of species\r\nrequires as many variants as possible; it requires that each individual\r\nshould be a _peculiar complex of hereditary characters_; that is, that\r\nall the fertilized germ-cells of a pair should possess an individually\r\nwell-marked character.\r\n\r\n[5] For this reason I have left the number of id-combinations given\r\nabove unaltered, though, according to the most recent researches into\r\nthe processes of maturation, they are probably too high, since every\r\nconceivable combination does not actually occur. We are here concerned\r\nless with the exact number than with the principle.\r\n\r\nThe justification of this postulate becomes all the clearer if we take\r\ninto consideration the male germ-cells as well as the female. Let us\r\nthink of the enormous number of sperm-cells which are produced by many\r\nanimals, and indeed by the highest of them--an almost incalculably\r\nlarge number which certainly goes far beyond millions. Let us assume\r\nthat in Man there may be 12,870 million spermatozoa, then, with\r\nsixteen ids, and with an equally frequent occurrence of all possible\r\ncombinations of germ-plasm--there would be 12,870--there would be a\r\nmillion of each type containing identical germ-plasm. The danger that\r\nseveral ova would be fertilized by identical sperm-cells would be by no\r\nmeans small.\r\n\r\nIt cannot, therefore, surprise us that other means have been employed\r\nby Nature to secure re-groupings of the ids. The simplest means would\r\nbe, if before each division of the primitive germ-cells the nuclear\r\nrods were to divide, and if the split halves were irregularly\r\nintermingled, then at the formation of the next nuclear spindle an\r\nentirely new arrangement of the halves would result. But in animals, at\r\nleast, this is certainly not the case; the processes of reduction are\r\nrestricted to the maturing divisions.\r\n\r\nYears ago Ischikawa observed that, in the conjugation of _Noctiluca_,\r\nthe nuclei of the two animals become closely apposed, but that they do\r\nnot fuse, although they behave like a single nucleus in the division\r\nwhich follows. In this case _paternal and maternal nuclear substance\r\nremain separate_ (Fig. 83, vol. i. p. 317). The same phenomenon has\r\nsince been repeatedly observed in many-celled animals, first by Häcker,\r\nthen by Rückert in the Copepods, and afterwards by Conklin in the eggs\r\nof a Gastropod (_Crepidula_). But all these observations referred only\r\nto the earlier stages of ovum-segmentation up to twenty-nine cells,\r\nand it could not be affirmed that the distinctiveness of the paternal\r\nand maternal chromosomes lasted till farther on into the ontogeny.\r\nProfessor Häcker now informs me, however, that he has been able to\r\ntrace this separateness in a Copepod (_Canthocamptus_) not only from\r\nthe beginning of segmentation on to the primitive genital cell, but\r\nalso through the divisions of this up to the mother-egg-cell[6].\r\nThus we may now assume that the paternal and maternal hereditary\r\nbodies remain distinct, not only for a time, but throughout the whole\r\ndevelopment, a fact which confirms our assumption of the independence\r\nof the nuclear rods, notwithstanding their apparent breaking-up in\r\nthe nuclear reticulum of the 'resting' nucleus. This new knowledge\r\nthrows fresh light in another direction; it proves to us that the\r\nremarkable and complicated processes which go on in the nucleus\r\nduring the maturing divisions have really the significance which I\r\nlong ago ascribed to them[7], that of effecting the maximum diversity\r\nof intermingling of the paternal and maternal hereditary elements.\r\nFor Häcker has shown that during the second maturation-division\r\nthe paternal and maternal chromosomes are no longer united each\r\nin a special group, but occur scattered about in the nucleus, and\r\nsubsequently come together again to form two differently combined\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n[6] Since this was written Häcker has published his results. See\r\n_Anatom. Anzeiger_ xv (1902), p. 440.\r\n\r\n[7] See my essay, _Amphimixis_, Jena, 1891.\r\n\r\nIf this were not so, if the maternal and paternal chromosomes remained\r\nseparate, then the reducing division would cause only one of these\r\ngroups to reach each of the germ-cells, and thus each mature ovum\r\nor sperm-cell would contain either only paternal or only maternal\r\nhereditary bodies. But this would make a reversion to more than three\r\ngenerations back impossible, and as such reversions undoubtedly occur,\r\nwe must conclude that manifold new combinations of the paternal and\r\nmaternal chromosomes take place. This obviously happens during the\r\nmaturation-divisions, at least in the Metazoa.\r\n\r\nThe more numerous the rods or the free individual ids in a species\r\nare, the more numerous are the possible combinations. Whether all the\r\nmathematically possible combinations actually occur is a different\r\nquestion, which I should not like to answer in the affirmative just\r\nyet; but in any case the _actual_ number of combinations in a species\r\nwith many nuclear elements will be greater than in one with few, and\r\nin this respect those species in which the ids occur as independent\r\ngranules will have an advantage over those in which they are combined\r\ninto rods or bands (idants). These latter, however, afford us a better\r\npossibility of deducing the new combinations of the ids, although the\r\nidants themselves are not outwardly distinguishable from each other.\r\n\r\nI must refrain from going into these highly interesting processes in\r\nmore detail just now. So much is certain, that Nature makes use of\r\n_various means_ to bring about the re-combination, and at the same time\r\nthe reduction of the ids during the two 'reducing divisions.' This is\r\nproved by the fact recently established by Montgomery, that in many\r\nanimal groups reduction results from the _first_ maturing division.\r\nWhether it operates at this stage with rings, bands, double rods,\r\nX-shaped structures, groups of four (tetrads), and so on, all this\r\nserves the same end, the more or less thoroughgoing re-arrangement of\r\nthe hereditary vital units. I am convinced that new investigations\r\ninto these processes, if they were undertaken from this point of view,\r\nwould lead to very important results[8]. It would be important to find\r\nout how great the variations are which thus arise, for it is very\r\nprobable that they differ in degree in the different animal-groups.\r\nEven the combination of the ids into rods (idants) indicates that some\r\nspecies may be more conservative than others in maintaining their\r\nid-combinations, and that there will be among them a greater tenacity\r\nin the hereditary combinations of characters (i.e. of the 'type' of\r\nthe parents). If we should succeed in penetrating more deeply into\r\nthese processes we should probably also understand why in certain human\r\nfamilies the hereditary characters are transmitted more purely and more\r\ntenaciously than those of other families with which they have mingled,\r\nand so on. It may well be that the persistence of character is due\r\nto the fact that ids which have once combined into rods hold firmly\r\ntogether, for it seems to me in no way impossible that individual\r\ndifferences should occur even in these most delicate processes.\r\n\r\n[8] Since this was written for the first edition observations of this\r\nprocess have been considerably increased, and discussions as to the\r\nexact interpretation of these are in full tide; we are surrounded by\r\na wealth of new observations, facts, and explanations, without having\r\nattained to a consistent and unified theory. Several naturalists, such\r\nas Boveri, Häcker, Wilson, and others, have attempted interpretations,\r\nbut these are in many points contradictory to one another. It is\r\ntherefore impossible to enter into the question in detail here;\r\nfurther light from new observations must be awaited. So much we may\r\nsay, however, that it is not chance alone which presides over the\r\nre-arrangement of the chromosomes during the reducing divisions;\r\n_affinities_ play a part also; there are stronger or weaker attractions\r\nbetween the chromosomes, which aid in determining their relative\r\nposition to one another.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave these more intimate questions out of account\r\naltogether, and turn our attention to the more obvious and less\r\ndelicate phenomena, and we find that the re-arrangement of ids\r\n(Neotaxis) which we have just discussed affords a simple explanation\r\nof the generally observed phenomenon of the differences between\r\nindividuals! Each individual is different from every other, not in\r\nthe case of Man alone, but in all species in which we can judge of\r\ndifferences, and this is true not only of descendants of different\r\nparents, but even of those of the same parents.\r\n\r\nOf course the differences between two brothers or two sisters do not\r\ndepend entirely on the hereditary basis, but in part also on external\r\nconditions which have affected them from embryonic development onwards.\r\nLet us suppose that of two brothers who have sprung from identical\r\ngerm-cells one becomes a sailor, the other a tailor; it would not\r\nsurprise us to find them very different in their fiftieth year, one\r\nweather-beaten and tanned, the other pale; one muscular, straight,\r\nand vigorous, the other weakly and of bent carriage. The same primary\r\nconstituents develop differently according to the conditions to which\r\nthey are exposed. But the two brothers will still resemble each other\r\nin the features of the face, colour of hair, form of eyes, stature and\r\nproportion of limbs, perhaps even in a birthmark, more than any other\r\nhuman beings of their own or any other family, and this resemblance\r\nwill depend upon the identity of the hereditary primary constituents,\r\non the similar id-combination of the germ-plasm.\r\n\r\nMan himself affords a particularly good example in favour of this\r\ninterpretation in the case of so-called 'identical twins.' It is well\r\nknown that there are two kinds of twins, those that are not strikingly\r\nalike, and often very different, and those that are alike to the extent\r\nof being mistakable for one another. Among the latter the resemblance\r\nmay go so far that the parents find it necessary to mark the children\r\nby some outward sign, so that they may not be continually confused.\r\nWe have now every reason to believe that twins of the former kind\r\nare derived from two different ova, and that those of the latter kind\r\narise from a single ovum, which, after fertilization, has divided into\r\ntwo ova. This not infrequently occurs in fishes and other animals,\r\nand we can bring it about artificially in a number of species by\r\nexperimentally separating the two first blastomeres.\r\n\r\nWe have here, then, a case of absolute identity of the germ-plasm in\r\ntwo individuals, for the id-combination of the two ova derived from the\r\nsame process of fertilization must be exactly the same. That in such a\r\ncase, notwithstanding the inevitable differences of external influences\r\nto which the twins are exposed from intra-uterine life onwards, such a\r\nhigh degree of resemblance should arise is a fact of great theoretical\r\nimportance. From the basis of the germ-plasm theory we can very well\r\nunderstand it, for, according to the theory, only precisely similar\r\ncombinations of ids can give rise to identical individuals.\r\n\r\nBut we learn more than this from the occurrence of identical twins.\r\nThey prove above all that the whole future individual is determined at\r\nfertilization, or, to express it theoretically, that the id-composition\r\nof the germ-plasm is decisive for the whole ontogeny. It might have\r\nbeen supposed that the combination of ids could change again during\r\ndevelopment, and that a greater multiplication of some than of others\r\nmight take place at certain stages of development, or through certain\r\nchance external influences. It might have been thought that there was a\r\nstruggle among the ids in the sense that some of them were suppressed\r\nand set aside. All such suppositions break down in face of the fact of\r\nidentical twins, which teaches us that identical germ-plasm evokes an\r\nontogeny which runs its course as regularly as two chronometers, which\r\nare constructed and regulated alike.\r\n\r\nBut when I say that a struggle of the ids, in the sense of a material\r\nsetting aside of some of them, cannot take place, I by no means intend\r\nto maintain that the influence which each individual id exerts on the\r\ncourse of development may not be disproportionate to that exerted by\r\nothers, and, under some circumstances, very disproportionate indeed.\r\nI must refrain from entering into this subject in detail now, but I\r\nshould like to give at least an indication of what I mean.\r\n\r\nIf the germ-plasm consists of ids, these ids collectively must\r\ndetermine the structure, the whole individuality--let us say, briefly,\r\nthe 'type' of the offspring; it is the resultant of all the different\r\nimpelling forces which are contained in the different ids. If these\r\nwere all equally strong, and all operating in the same direction,\r\nthey would necessarily all have the same share in the resultant of\r\ndevelopment, the 'type' of the child. But this is not the case.\r\n\r\nNumerous experiments on the hybridization of two species of plant have\r\ntaught us that the descendants of such hybridization usually maintain\r\na medium between the ancestral species; but it is not always the case,\r\nfor in many hybrids the character of one species, whether paternal or\r\nmaternal, preponderates in the young plant.\r\n\r\nWe recognize the same thing still more clearly in Man, whose children\r\nby no means always maintain a medium between the characters of the two\r\nparents, but frequently resemble one--the father or the mother--much\r\nmore strongly than the other.\r\n\r\nHow can this fact be theoretically explained? Must we ascribe to the\r\nids of the father or of the mother a greater determining power? Without\r\nexcluding such an assumption as on _a priori_ grounds inadmissible,\r\nI am inclined to believe that we do not require it to explain _this_\r\nphenomenon. For, if we take our stand simply on the fact of the\r\npreponderance of one parent, it follows directly from this that not\r\nall the ids control the type of the child, let the cause of the\r\nnon-co-operation of some of them be what it may. But if in this case\r\nonly a portion of the ids contained in the germ-plasm controls the\r\ntype, this combination of ids suffices to make the child resemble\r\none parent, the father, for instance, and consequently half the\r\nnumber of ids is sufficient in some circumstances to determine the\r\nchild--taking for granted that the one-sidedness of the inheritance is\r\ncomplete, which never actually happens. But the half number of ids can\r\nonly suffice if it includes the same combinations of ids which have\r\ndetermined the type in the case of the father; as soon as one or more\r\nids of this particular combination are replaced by others the paternal\r\ngerm-plasm alone is not enough to call forth complete resemblance in\r\nthe child.\r\n\r\nBut, at the reduction, a change of arrangement of ids takes place,\r\nand a new combination arises, and thus each germ-cell receives its\r\nparticular group of ids. It may thus happen that, in one particular\r\nsperm-cell, exactly the same group of ids is contained as that which\r\ndetermined the type of the father, and that the same is true of a\r\nparticular egg-cell in regard to the type of the mother. Let us now\r\nassume that a sperm-cell and an egg-cell meet, which contain both those\r\ngroups of ids which had determined the type of the father and of the\r\nmother; if the determining power of the maternal and paternal ids were\r\nequal a child would result which would maintain the medium between\r\nfather and mother.\r\n\r\nAs is well known this does happen not infrequently, although it is\r\ndifficult or impossible to demonstrate it precisely. In plant-hybrids\r\nproof is easier, and it has been established that by far the greater\r\nnumber of hybrids maintain a medium between the characters of the two\r\nancestral species. This proves that our assumption of equal strength\r\nof the ids of both species must be correct in general, for we know\r\ndefinitely in this case, as I shall show later, that the paternal\r\nand the maternal ids are equivalent as regards the characters of the\r\nspecies. This is the case, for instance, with the hybrids between the\r\ntwo species of tobacco-plant, _Nicotiana rustica_ and _N. paniculata_,\r\nwhich were reared by Kölreuter as far back as the eighteenth century,\r\nand which then, as now, maintained a fairly exact medium between the\r\ntwo ancestral species, and did so in all the individuals. Both species\r\nthus strive to stamp their own character on the young plant, and in\r\nboth the hereditary power is equally great; in both it is contained\r\nin the same number of ids, that is, in the half, for both kinds\r\nof sex-cell have undergone reducing division. We have here, then,\r\nstrict proof that the half number of ids suffices to reproduce in the\r\noffspring the type of the species, or, more generally, of the parents.\r\n\r\nIf we apply these results to the inheritance of individual differences\r\nin Man, we may say, that those germ-cells, to which at the reducing\r\ndivision the same combination of ids has been handed on as that which\r\nalready determined the type of the parent, will endeavour to impress\r\nthis image again on the child. If a female cell of this kind combine\r\nwith a male which likewise contains the facies-combination of the\r\nparent, in this case the father, the same thing will happen which we\r\ndescribed in the case of the plant-hybrids, that is, a medium form\r\nbetween the type of the two parents will arise.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently, however, there is a marked preponderance of the one\r\nparent in the type of the child, and we have to inquire whether the\r\ntheory gives us any help with regard to such a case.\r\n\r\nOne might be inclined to assume a difference in the determining power\r\nof the paternal and maternal ids, but if we cannot show to what extent\r\nand for what reason this power may be different such an assumption\r\nremains rather an evasion than an explanation. Moreover, it would not\r\nalways apply to the conditions in Man, for if, for instance, the ids\r\nof a particular mother were in general stronger than those of the\r\nfather, all the children of the pair in question would necessarily\r\ntake after the mother; but it happens not infrequently that one child\r\nresembles the father preponderantly, and another the mother. Moreover,\r\nthe ids pass continually from the male to the female individual, and\r\nconversely, by virtue of the continuity of the germ-plasm, so that the\r\nidea that sex can have anything to do with the relative strength of the\r\nids is altogether erroneous.\r\n\r\nBut, as I have already said, unilateral inheritance occurs even in\r\nthe mingling of species-characters, and most clearly in the case of\r\nplant-hybrids. Thus, for instance, hybrids between the two species of\r\npink, _Dianthus barbatus_ and _Dianthus deltoides_, resemble the latter\r\nspecies much more closely than the former, and the hybrid between the\r\ntwo species of foxglove which are wild in Germany, _Digitalis purpurea_\r\nand _Digitalis lutea_, is much more like the latter than like the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nIt might be reasonably asked whether, in these crossings, the normal\r\nnumber of ids in one species is not greater than in the other. We\r\nknow that, among animals at least, differences in the normal number\r\nof chromosomes occur even in very nearly related species. It is not\r\nimpossible that this, in many cases, is really the cause of the\r\ndiversity of transmitting power in different species. Nevertheless, we\r\ncannot rest satisfied with this, for, in the first place, this cause\r\ncould not apply to the apparent unilateral inheritance from one parent\r\nin Man, since the normal number of ids, as far as we know, is strictly\r\nmaintained in the same species, and second, this would not explain\r\ncertain phenomena of inheritance in plant-hybrids.\r\n\r\nIt happens not only frequently, but usually, that the different parts\r\nof the hybrid take after one or other parent in different degree, and\r\nthis is the case also with children. In the hybrid between the two\r\nspecies of tobacco-plant, _Nicotiana rustica_ and _N. paniculata_,\r\nwhich I have already given as an example of a medium form between\r\nthe two parents, such diversities occur regularly in all the hybrid\r\nindividuals. Thus the corolla-tube of the hybrid is nearer _N.\r\npaniculata_ in regard to its length, but nearer _N. rustica_ in regard\r\nto its breadth. Many hybrids suggest one parent-form in the leaves, the\r\nother in the blossoms. In the same way in the child the form of eye\r\nmay be that of the father, the colour of the iris that of the mother,\r\nthe nose maternal, the mouth paternal--in short, the preponderance in\r\nheredity swings hither and thither from part to part, from organ to\r\norgan, from character to character, and this is even the rule though\r\nthe oscillations may not always be apparent and are often invisible.\r\n\r\nIf we think of the proposition we arrived at earlier, and which was\r\nproved chiefly by the case of identical twins, that the facies or\r\n'type' of the descendant is determined at fertilization, we may be\r\ninclined to regard such an oscillation of the hereditary tendencies\r\nas almost impossible, for it means that, with the given mingling of\r\nparental germ-plasms, the potency of inheritance from the two parents\r\nin every part of the offspring is determined once for all in advance.\r\nBut the case of identical twins corroborates these oscillations, for\r\nin them, too, the father predominates in one part, the mother in\r\nanother, and it proves, at the same time, that these oscillations do\r\nnot depend on any chances whatever in development, but that they are\r\nexactly predetermined in the mingling of the hereditary substances in\r\nthe germ-plasm of the fertilized ovum, and are strictly adhered to\r\nthroughout development.\r\n\r\nThis fact can only be explained thus: the primary constituents of\r\nthe different parts and characters of the body are contained in the\r\nparental germ-plasm in varying degrees of hereditary or transmissive\r\nstrength, and this can be understood very well from our point of view\r\nwithout putting anything new into the 'portmanteau' of our theory\r\n(Delage).\r\n\r\nBut I must digress a little in order to make this plain.\r\n\r\nWhen, in speaking of plant-hybrids, I said that the collective ids\r\nof the germ-plasm of a species must be equivalent in regard to the\r\ncharacters of the species, I did not speak quite precisely; in the\r\nmajority of ids, in many cases in an overwhelming majority, this must\r\nbe the case, but not actually in all, at least not on the assumption\r\nwe make that the transformation of species is accomplished under the\r\ncontrol of natural selection.\r\n\r\nLet us recall what we have already established in regard to the\r\nevolutionary power of natural selection, namely, that the changes which\r\nit controls can never transcend the range of their utility, and it will\r\nbe clear to us that, of the many ids which make up the germ-plasm of\r\nthe species, only so many will be modified as are necessary to evoke\r\nthe character which has varied. Just as the protective resemblance\r\nof an insect to a leaf may be raised to a very high pitch, but can\r\nnever become perfect, because an imperfect resemblance is already\r\nsufficient to deceive the persecutor, and the selective process comes\r\nto a standstill because individuals which possessed a still greater\r\nresemblance to a leaf would be no better protected from destruction\r\nthan the others, so in the modification of a species the whole of the\r\nids need not at once be modified, if a majority is sufficient to stamp\r\nthe great majority of individuals with the desired variation. But it\r\nmay happen that, at the reduction of ids during the development of the\r\ngerm-cells, an id-combination with wholly or almost wholly unchanged\r\nids may come together in one germ-cell, and if another sperm-cell of\r\nthis kind meets with an egg-cell similarly constituted, an individual\r\nof the old species must arise. But this must--on our assumption--be\r\nat a disadvantage as compared with the transformed individuals in the\r\nstruggle for existence, and will perish in it, and therefore the number\r\nof unmodified ids in the germ-plasm of the species will gradually\r\ndiminish. It is obvious, however, that this will take place very\r\nslowly, as we may conclude from the phenomena of reversion, of which I\r\nshall have to speak later on.\r\n\r\nBut what is true of the ids is true also of their constituent parts,\r\nthe determinants, and that--if I mistake not--is fundamental in the\r\ninterpretation of the alternation of hereditary succession in the parts\r\nof the child.\r\n\r\nAccording to our theory, the ids do not collectively exert a\r\ncontrolling influence on the cells, not even on the germ-cells, whose\r\nhistological differentiation into spermatic or egg-cells can only\r\ndepend on control through specific sex-cell determinants. It is the\r\ndifferent determinants of the ids that control; transformations of\r\nthe species will, it is true, depend on transformations of the ids,\r\nbut this need not necessarily consist in a variation of _all_ the\r\ndeterminants of the id. If, for instance, two species of butterfly,\r\n_Lycæna agestis_ in Germany and _Lycæna artaxerxes_ in Scotland, only\r\ndiffer from each other in that the black spot in the middle of the wing\r\nin _L. agestis_ is milk-white in _L. artaxerxes_, no other determinants\r\nin the id of the germ-plasm can be different except those which control\r\nthis particular spot. In a majority of the ids in _L. artaxerxes_ the\r\ndeterminants of this spot must have been modified, let us say, to the\r\nproduction of 'milk-white.' This majority will increase very slowly if\r\nthe white colour has no pronounced advantage for the persistence of\r\nthe species, but it will increase gradually, as we have already seen,\r\nthough extremely slowly, through the elimination of those individuals\r\nwhose germ-plasm at the reducing division has chanced to receive a\r\nmajority of ids with the old, unmodified determinants, and which have\r\ntherefore reverted to the ancestral form. This will happen whenever the\r\nnew character has any use, however small, in maintaining the species.\r\n\r\nBut in most modifications of species quite a number of parts and\r\ncharacters have undergone variation either simultaneously or in\r\nrapid succession; in many cases nearly all the details of structure,\r\nand therefore almost all the determinants of the germ-plasm, must\r\nhave varied. We must not, however, assume that all the equivalent\r\ndeterminants, for instance, all the determinants _K_ in all the ids,\r\nhave varied[9], and above all we must not take for granted that\r\nthe determinants of different characters or parts of the body, for\r\ninstance, the determinants _L_, _M_, or _N_, must all undergo variation\r\nin an equal number of ids. It will depend on two factors whether a new\r\ncharacter is implicit, in the form of varied determinants, in a small\r\nor in a very large majority of ids: first, on the relative age of the\r\ncharacter, and, secondly, on its value in relation to the persistence\r\nof the species. The more important a character is for the species the\r\nmore frequently is it decisive for the life or death of the individual,\r\nand the more sharply will individuals not possessing it be eliminated,\r\nand the more rapidly, therefore, will those whose germ-plasm still\r\ncontains a majority of the unvaried determinants of this character\r\ntend to disappear. In this way these determinants will tend to sink\r\ndown from generation to generation to an ever smaller minority in the\r\ngerm-plasm of those that survive.\r\n\r\n[9] By equivalent or homologous determinants I mean the determinants of\r\ndifferent ids which determine _similar parts_, e.g. the scales of that\r\nwing-spot in _Lycæna agestis_ which is alluded to above, and to which\r\nwe must refer again in more detail.\r\n\r\nThus in the ids of any species which has been in some way\r\ntransformed--and that is as much as to say, in every species--the\r\nequivalent or homologous determinants are modified in a very varied\r\npercentage. A very modern and at the same time not very important\r\ncharacter _K´_ will only be contained in a small majority of ids,\r\nwhile in the remainder the original homologous ancestral determinant\r\n_K_ is contained; an older but not very much more important character\r\n_M´_ must have its determinants in a larger majority in the ids, while\r\na character _V´_ of decisive importance for the preservation of the\r\nspecies, if it has been in existence long enough, must be represented\r\nin almost all the ids, so that the homologous unvaried determinants of\r\nthe ancestral species _V_ can only have persisted in an id here and\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIf this argument be correct, many phenomena of inheritance become\r\nintelligible, especially the variability in the expression of the\r\ninheritance in the parts of the offspring, which is more or less\r\nrigidly predetermined at fertilization. For the germ-plasm thus\r\ncontains in advance every kind of determinant in diverse _nuances_,\r\nand in definite numerical proportions. In a plant _N´_, for instance,\r\n_Ba´_ may be the determinant of the modern leaf-form, and may occur\r\nin twenty-two out of twenty-four ids of the germ-plasm, while the two\r\nremaining ids still contain unmodified the old leaf-form determinants\r\n_Ba_, which the ancestral form _N_ possessed. But the flower of _N´_\r\nmay be of still more recent origin, and contain the modern flower\r\ndeterminants _Bl´_ only in sixteen out of twenty-four ids, while in the\r\nother eight the old flower-determinant _Bl_ of the ancestral form has\r\npersisted. Let us now suppose that another nearly related species _P´_\r\nhas, conversely, a recently changed leaf-form but a very ancient form\r\nof flower, so that the former is represented only in sixteen ids by the\r\ndeterminants of the leaf _ba´_ and the latter in twenty-two ids by the\r\nflower-determinants _bl´_: it is obvious that when the two species are\r\ncrossed, notwithstanding the equal number of ids in the germ-plasm, the\r\nleaves of the hybrid will resemble more closely those of the ancestral\r\nform _N_, and the flowers those of the form _P_; it is even conceivable\r\nthat in such a case the numerically preponderating leaf-determinants\r\n_N_, and the equally preponderating flower-determinants of _P_ may form\r\na close phalanx, so to speak, against the much less numerous homologous\r\ndeterminants of the other species, and that against this power working\r\nin a definite direction the others can make no headway and are simply\r\ncondemned to inaction.\r\n\r\nHow we may or can picture this as occurring is a question which of\r\ncourse admits only of being answered very hypothetically, and it leads\r\nus, moreover, into the region of the fundamental phenomena of life,\r\nwith the interpretation of which we are not here concerned. For the\r\npresent we have assumed that life is a chemico-physical phenomenon, and\r\nwe have postponed the deeper explanation of it to the remote future,\r\nthat we may confine ourselves in the meantime to the solution of the\r\nproblem of inheritance on the basis of the forces resident in the vital\r\nelements. But we may, nevertheless, make the supposition that a kind of\r\nstruggle between the different kinds of biophors may take place within\r\nthe cell, if the homologous determinants of all the ids for the control\r\nof the cell have entered into it.\r\n\r\nIn many cases this struggle will be decided by the numerical\r\npreponderance of one kind of determinant over the other, but it is\r\ncertainly conceivable that dynamic differences may also have something\r\nto do with it.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, abstain from trying to penetrate further into the\r\nobscurity of these processes, and let us content ourselves with\r\nestablishing that the preponderance of one parent in some or many\r\nparts of the child may be almost if not quite complete, and that this\r\ncompels us to assume that the hereditary substance of the other parent\r\nis in such cases rendered inoperative--for we know it is present--since\r\nthe ids of both parents all go through the whole ontogeny, and are\r\ncontained in every somatic cell.\r\n\r\nUpon this struggle between homologous determinants depends the\r\npossibility of the entire suppression or inhibition of the influence\r\nof one parent, the whole diversity in the mingling of paternal and\r\nmaternal character in the body of the offspring. It is in this that we\r\nmust seek the explanation of the fact that not only whole bodily parts\r\nof the child, such as arms, legs, the nature of the skin, the form of\r\nthe skull, may take after sometimes the father, sometimes the mother\r\nwholly or predominantly, but that the small separate subdivisions of\r\na complex organ may sometimes turn out more maternal, sometimes more\r\npaternal. Thus intelligence from the mother and will from the father,\r\nmusical talent from the father and a talent for drawing from the\r\nmother, may be inherited by the same child. I do not doubt that genius\r\ndepends in great part on a happy combination of such mental endowments\r\nof the ancestors in one child. Of course something more is necessary,\r\nnamely, the strengthening of certain of these hereditary endowments,\r\nbut of this we shall speak later.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, not only the immediate ancestors, that is to say,\r\nthe parents, that have to be taken account of in this mingling of\r\nhereditary contributions, but also those more remote. Not a few\r\ncharacters in the child do not occur in either parent, but were present\r\nin the grandparents, and their reappearance is called 'atavism' or\r\n'reversion.' Let us consider this phenomenon in more detail, and try\r\nto find out whether and how far it can be interpreted by means of our\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThe simplest and clearest cases are again found among plant-hybrids.\r\nIt may happen, for instance, that a hybrid between two species, when\r\ndusted with its own pollen, gives rise to descendants, some of which\r\nresemble only one of the ancestral forms: thus we have reversion to\r\none of the grandparents. The explanation of this lies in the different\r\nmodes in which the reducing divisions are effected; if they take place\r\nin such a manner that all the paternal ids of the hybrid are separated\r\nfrom the maternal ids, then the result is germ-cells which are like\r\nthose of the grandparents, that is, those of the parent species, and\r\nthese, if they happen to combine in amphimixis, must give rise to a\r\npure seedling of one or other of the two ancestral species. This case\r\noccurs less rarely than was formerly supposed, and than it could do if\r\nabsolutely free combination of the idants took place at reduction. If\r\ncombination were quite unrestricted, all other possible combinations\r\nwould be likely to occur as frequently as these. But recent experiments\r\nhave shown that, in many plant-hybrids, the germ-cells of the hybrids\r\nwhich are fertilized by their own pollen are either purely paternal or\r\npurely maternal. There cannot, therefore, be free combination of the\r\nidants at the reducing divisions; the idants of the two parent-forms\r\nseparate from one another and do not combine. It is doubtful, however,\r\nwhether the same thing occurs within a race, for instance, in the case\r\nof reproduction within a human race.\r\n\r\nIn Man reversion to a grandparent occurs not infrequently, and we\r\nmay explain it thus: the id-group which controlled the type of the\r\ngrandfather was also contained in the germ-cell which gave rise to\r\nthe existence of the father, but it did not dominate the type in\r\nthat case because a more powerful id-group was opposed to it in the\r\ngerm-cell of the grandmother. When, later on, at the reducing divisions\r\nof the germ-cells of the father, this id-group again arrived in the\r\nsperm-cells of the father, it would predominately control the type of\r\nthe child, that is, of the third generation, provided that the egg-cell\r\nwith which it combined contained a weaker id-group.\r\n\r\nIn the case of ordinary plant-hybrids what are designated reversions\r\ncan only be called so in a wide sense, for the ancestral characters\r\nare contained _visibly_ in the parent, although mingled with those\r\nof the other parent. In human families, however, there are undoubted\r\ncases in which one or more characters of the grandparent reappear in\r\nthe child which were not in any visible way expressed in the parent,\r\nand must therefore have been contained in the parent's germ-plasm in\r\na latent state. And there are both in animals and plants reversions\r\nto ancestors lying much further back, to characters and groups of\r\ncharacters which have not been visible for many generations, and the\r\noccurrence of these can only be explained on the assumption that\r\ncertain groups of ancestral determinants have been carried on in the\r\ngerm-plasm in too small a number to be able to give rise ordinarily\r\nto the relevant character. Such isolated determinants may, however,\r\nin certain circumstances be strengthened by the amphimixis of two\r\ngerm-cells both containing small groups of them, and thus augmented\r\nthey may gain a controlling influence. In this case the chances of the\r\nreducing divisions have a part to play, since they bring together the\r\nold unvaried ancestral determinants which, as we have seen, may persist\r\nin the germ-plasm of any species through a long series of generations.\r\nThis would, of course, only suffice to bring about a reversion if the\r\ndeterminants of the ancestral species were still contained in the\r\ngerm-plasm in comparative abundance. If this is no longer the case,\r\nsomething more is necessary, and that is the relative weakness of the\r\nmore modern determinants.\r\n\r\nIf two white-flowered species of thorn-apple, _Datura ferox_ and\r\n_Datura lævis_, be crossed, there arises a hybrid with bluish violet\r\nflowers and brown stalks instead of green. This was interpreted by\r\nDarwin as a reversion to violet-flowering ancestral species on both\r\nsides, for there are even now a great number of species of _Datura_\r\nwith violet flowers and brown stalks. When the two white forms are\r\ncrossed the reversion takes place every time, not merely in some cases,\r\nand we may conclude from this that in both these species there is still\r\nsuch a strong admixture of the same unvaried ancestral ids that they\r\nalways excel the ids of the two modern species crossed, in strength\r\nthough certainly not in number. And this superiority must again depend\r\non the fact that similar determinants of the same part are cumulative\r\nin their effect, while dissimilars are not.\r\n\r\nFor this reason reversions to remote ancestors occur readily when\r\nspecies and breeds are crossed, while they are rare in the normal\r\ninbreeding of a species. The reversions of the breeds of pigeon to\r\ntheir wild ancestral form, the slaty-blue rock-pigeon, never result, as\r\nDarwin showed, and as we have already noticed, from pure breeding of\r\none race, but only when two or more breeds are repeatedly crossed with\r\none another. Even then it occurs by no means always, but only now and\r\nagain. The germ-plasm of the breeds must therefore still contain ids\r\nof the rock-pigeon, but in a small number, varying from individual to\r\nindividual. If by fortunate reducing divisions and the meeting together\r\nof a sperm-cell rich in ancestral ids with a similarly endowed egg-cell\r\nthe number of ancestral ids be raised to such a point that it exceeds\r\nthe number of modern-breed ids contained in each one of the conjugating\r\ngerm-cells, the ancestral ids control the development and reversion\r\noccurs, for the ancestral ids together have a cumulative effect while\r\nthe ids of the two parent breeds are different and therefore, as far\r\nas they are so, cannot be co-operative in their influence. But it must\r\nbe understood that they need not be different as far as _all_ their\r\ndeterminants are concerned, but usually only as regards some groups,\r\nand thus it happens that reversion does not occur in regard to all, but\r\nonly in regard to particular characters--thus in the _Datura_ hybrids,\r\nchiefly in regard to the colour of the flowers and the stem, and in\r\nthe hybrids between different breeds of pigeon mainly in regard to the\r\ncolour and marking of the plumage.\r\n\r\nThe reversions of the horse and ass to striped ancestors, which Darwin\r\nhas made famous, go much further back into the ancestral history of the\r\nspecies, for while we know the ancestral form of the domestic pigeon\r\nin the still living rock-dove (_Columba livia_), the ancestral form\r\ncommon to the horse and the ass is extinct, and we can only suppose\r\nthat it was striped like a zebra, because such striping occasionally\r\noccurs in pure horses and pure asses, at least in their youth, although\r\nnow only on the legs, and because this striping is often more marked\r\nin the hybrid between the horse and the ass, the mule. In Italy, where\r\none sees hundreds of mules, the striping is not exactly frequent,\r\nbut it may occur in about two per cent., while in America it is said\r\nto be much more frequent. The germ-plasm of the horse and the ass\r\nmust therefore contain, in varying numbers, ids whose skin-colour\r\ndeterminants represent in part still unmodified ancestral characters.\r\nWhen two germ-cells chance to meet in fertilization, both of which have\r\nreceived, through a favourable reducing division, a relatively large\r\nnumber of such ids, a relative majority of these in the fertilized\r\novum is opposed to the dissimilar and therefore mutually neutralizing\r\nhomologous determinants of horse and ass, and reversion to the\r\nancestral form occurs.\r\n\r\nThese cases of reversion are enough to show us that the old unmodified\r\nancestral determinants may persist in the germ-plasm through long\r\nseries of generations. But an even deeper glimpse into the dim ancient\r\nhistory of our modern species of horses is afforded by the occurrence\r\nof three-toed horses, references to a small number of which the\r\npalæontologist Marsh was able to discover in literature, and one of\r\nwhich he was able to observe in life. Julius Caesar possessed a horse\r\nwhose three-toed feet represented a reversion to the horses of Tertiary\r\ntimes, _Mesohippus_, _Miohippus_, and _Protohippus_ or _Hipparion_; for\r\nall these genera possessed, in addition to the strong middle toe, two\r\nweaker and shorter lateral toes.\r\n\r\nIn the germ-plasm of our modern horses there must still persist in\r\ncertain ids the determinants of the ancestral foot, which, after a long\r\nsuccession of favourable reducing divisions combined with favourable\r\nchances of fertilization, may come to be in a majority, and may thus be\r\nable to induce a reappearance of a character which has long been hidden\r\nunder the surface of the present-day type of the species.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to enter further on the discussion of the phenomena\r\nof inheritance. A more detailed investigation of the phenomena of\r\nreversion is to be found in '_The Germ-plasm_' published ten years\r\nago; and the discussion could not be resumed here without a critical\r\nconsideration of a relatively large series of newly acquired facts\r\nnot always harmonizing, and, as yet, not even fully available. The\r\nyear 1900 has given us the investigations of three botanists, De\r\nVries, Correns, and Tschermak, who have sought by experiments in\r\nhybridization between different sorts of peas, beans, maize, and other\r\nplants, to throw light on the phenomena of inheritance, and thus on\r\nthe actual processes which occur in the germ-plasm at the reducing\r\ndivision. This led to the discovery that similar experiments had been\r\npublished as far back as 1866 by the Abbot of Brünn, Gregor Mendel, and\r\nthat these had been formulated as a law which is now called Mendel's\r\nlaw. Correns showed, however, that this law, though correct in certain\r\ncases, did not by any means hold good in all, and we must thus postpone\r\nthe working of this new material into our theory until a very much\r\nwider basis of facts has been supplied by the botanists. There is less\r\nto be hoped for from the zoologists in regard to this problem owing\r\nto the almost insuperable difficulties in the way of a long series\r\nof experiments in hybridization in animals. I myself have repeatedly\r\nattempted experiments in this direction, and have always had to abandon\r\nthem, either because the crossing succeeded too rarely, or because the\r\nhybrids did not reproduce among themselves, or did so defectively, or\r\nbecause the distinguishing characters of the crossed breeds proved\r\ninsufficiently tenacious or diagnostic. But it would be a fine task for\r\nzoological gardens to undertake such experiments from the point of view\r\nof the germ-plasm theory, and their success would afford material for\r\nthe criticism of the theory, the more valuable because it is apparent\r\nfrom the experiments on plants that the processes of heredity are\r\nmanifold, and are far from being uniform in different domains[10].\r\n\r\n[10] Castle and Allen have recently published the results of\r\nexperiments in crossing white mice with grey, and these confirm\r\nMendel's Law.\r\n\r\nI have assumed for my theory that the reducing division took place\r\naccording to the laws of chance, and that thus every combination of ids\r\noccurred with equal frequency. This assumption seems to be confirmed,\r\nby the experiments of the botanists I have mentioned, only in so far\r\nthat in the crossing of hybrids with one another every combination\r\nof distinctive characters occurred with equal frequency. But, on the\r\nother hand, the splitting of the germ-plasm at the reducing division\r\nseems, as I said before, in many cases to take place in such a way that\r\nthe id-groups of the two parents are discretely separated from one\r\nanother; this was so in the stocks, peas, beans, and other hybrids.\r\nBut even if this were always the case in these, we could hardly infer\r\nthat it must be the same everywhere; we should rather expect that the\r\nrelationship of the two parents and their ids would bring into play the\r\nfiner attractions and repulsions between the ids of the germ-plasm,\r\nand would thus determine their arrangement and grouping. Further\r\ninvestigations may clear up this point; in the meantime we can only\r\nsay that already--even among hybrids--many deviations from Mendel's Law\r\nhave been established, for instance, by Bateson and Saunders (1902).\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude this lecture I should like to refer briefly to a\r\nphenomenon which Darwin was acquainted with and sought to explain\r\nthrough his theory of Pangenesis, but which at a later date was\r\nregarded as not sufficiently authenticated to justify any attempt\r\nat a theoretical explanation, since it seemed to contradict all our\r\nconceptions of hereditary substance and its operations. I refer to the\r\nphenomenon to which the botanists have given the pretty name of Xenia\r\n(guest-gifts), and which consists in the fact that in crosses of two\r\ndifferent plants the characters of the male may appear not only in the\r\nyoung plant but even in the seed, so that a transference of paternal\r\ncharacters seems to take place from the pollen-tube to the mother, to\r\nthe 'tissue of the maternal ovary.' In heads of yellow-grained maize\r\n(_Zea_) it is said that, after dusting with pollen from a blue-seeded\r\nvariety, blue seeds appear among the yellow, and similar observations\r\non other cultivated plants have been on record for more than half a\r\ncentury. Thus dusting the stigma of green varieties of grape with the\r\npollen of a dark blue kind is said frequently to give rise to dark blue\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nDarwin accepted these observations as correct, and endeavoured\r\nto explain them as due to a migration of his 'gemmules' from the\r\nfertilized ovum into the surrounding tissue of the mother-plant. His\r\nexplanation was not correct, we can say with confidence now, but he\r\nwas right so far, for the phenomena of Xenia do occur; they are not\r\nillusory as most modern botanists seem inclined to believe. I myself\r\nwas at first inclined to wait for further facts in proof that the\r\nphenomena of Xenia really occurred before attempting to bring them\r\ninto harmony with my theory, and this will not be found fault with\r\nwhen it is remembered that these cases of Xenia seem to stand in\r\ndirect contradiction to the fundamental postulates of the germ-plasm\r\ntheory. For this depends essentially on a definite stable structure\r\nof the germ-substance, which lies within the nucleus in the form of\r\nchromosomes, and which cannot pass from one cell to another in any\r\nother way than by cell-division and division of the nucleus; how then\r\ncould it pass from the fertilized ovum to the cells of the endosperm\r\nwhich do not derive their origin from it at all, but from other cells\r\nof the embryo-sac? In point of fact some of my opponents have cited\r\nXenia as an actual refutation of my theory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82. Fertilization in the Lily (_Lilium martagon_),\r\nafter Guignard. _A_, the embryo-sac before fertilization; _sy_,\r\nsynergidæ; _eiz_, ovum; _op_ and _up_, upper and lower 'polar nuclei';\r\n_ap_, antipodal cells. _B_, the upper part of the embryo-sac,\r\ninto which the pollen-tube (_pschl_) has penetrated with the male\r\nsex-nucleus (♂_k_) and its centrosphere; below that is the ovum-nucleus\r\n(♀_k_) with its (also doubled) centrosphere (_csph_). _C_, remains of\r\nthe pollen-tube (_pschl_); the two sex-nuclei are closely apposed.\r\nHighly magnified.]\r\n\r\nThat cases of Xenia really do occur is now established by the\r\ncomprehensive and at the same time exceedingly careful experiments\r\nrecently made by C. Correns with _Zea Mais_; it is only necessary to\r\nlook through the beautiful figures with which his work is adorned to be\r\nconvinced that heads of maize whose blossoms have been dusted with the\r\npollen of a different kind produce more or less numerous seeds of the\r\npaternal kind, usually mingled with those of the maternal. Thus heads\r\nof the variety _Zea alba_ resulting from fertilization with _Z. cyanea_\r\nexhibited a majority of white grains, but among them a smaller number\r\nof blue; and the converse experiment, of dusting _Z. cyanea_ with\r\nthe pollen of _Z. alba_, yielded heads in which a minority of white\r\ngrains appears among a majority of blue. But it is always only the\r\nnutritive layer surrounding the embryo--the endosperm--which exhibits\r\nthe character of the paternal species, and even the capsule surrounding\r\nthe seed shows nothing of it, but is purely maternal. Thus the heads\r\nof different species with pale-yellow capsule, when dusted with the\r\npollen of _Z. rubra_, never have red seeds like those of _Z. rubra_,\r\nbut always seeds with a pale-yellow skin, while, in the converse\r\nexperiment, dusting of the red-skinned species _Z. rubra_ with pollen\r\nfrom _Z. vulgata_, all the seeds are red, like those of the maternal\r\nspecies, and the influence of the paternal species only shows when the\r\nstrong red skin has been removed, so that the intense yellow colour of\r\nthe endosperm, which in the pure maternal species is white, is exposed\r\nto view. Thus the mysterious influence of the pollen never goes beyond\r\nthe endosperm, and the riddle of this influence is solved in the most\r\nunexpected manner, indeed was solved even before Correns had securely\r\nestablished the genuine occurrence of Xenia. The explanation is due\r\nto recent disclosures in regard to the processes of fertilization in\r\nflowering plants.\r\n\r\nIt had long been known that the pollen-tube contains not merely one\r\ngenerative nucleus but two, which arise from one by division. But what\r\nhad till recently remained unknown was that not only one of these\r\npenetrated into the embryo-sac to enter into amphimixis with the\r\negg-cell, but that the other also makes its way in, and there fuses\r\nwith the two nuclei which had long been designated the upper and lower\r\npolar-nuclei (Fig. 82, op. cit.). Nawaschin and Guignard demonstrated\r\nthat these two nuclei fuse _with the second male_ nucleus; thus two\r\nacts of fertilization are accomplished in the embryo-sac, and one of\r\nthese gives rise to the embryo, while the second becomes nothing less\r\nthan the endosperm, the nutritive layer which surrounds the embryo,\r\nwhose origin from the polar nuclei had been previously recognized.\r\n\r\nThus the riddle of Xenia is essentially solved. We understand how\r\npaternal primary constituents may find their way into the endosperm,\r\nand indeed must do so regularly; we understand also how the paternal\r\ninfluence never goes beyond the endosperm. The riddle is thus not only\r\nsolved, but at the same time the view which assumes a fixed germ-plasm,\r\nand believes it to lie in the nuclear substance of the germ-cells,\r\nreceives further confirmation, if it should need any, for if facts\r\nwhich are apparently contradictory to a theory can be naturally\r\nbrought into harmony with it, this affords a stronger argument for the\r\ncorrectness of the theory than the power of explaining the facts which\r\nwere used in building it up.\r\n\r\nThere is much more to be said in regard to Xenia, and I am sure\r\nthat much that is of interest will be brought to light by deeper\r\ninvestigation; theoretical difficulties will still have to be overcome,\r\nand I have already pointed out one of these in my '_Germ-plasm_,' but I\r\nmust here rest satisfied with what has been already said.\r\n\r\nWe have now passed in review and attempted to fit into the theory a\r\nsufficiently large number of the phenomena of heredity for the purpose\r\nof these lectures. Although, as is natural, much of this must remain\r\nhypothetical, we may accept the following series of propositions as\r\nwell founded: there is a hereditary substance, the germ-plasm; it is\r\ncontained in very minimal quantity in the germ-cells, and there in\r\nthe chromosomes of the nucleus; it consists of primary constituents\r\nor determinants, which in their diverse arrangement beside or upon\r\none another form an extremely complex structure, the id. Ids and\r\ndeterminants are living vital unities. Each nucleus contains several,\r\noften many, ids, and the number of ids varies with the species and is\r\nconstant for each. The ids of the germ-plasm of each species have had\r\na historical development, and are derived from the germ-plasm of the\r\npreceding lineage of species; therefore ids can never arise anew but\r\nonly through multiplication of already existing ids.\r\n\r\nAnd now, equipped with this knowledge, let us return to the point\r\nfrom which we started, and inquire whether the Lamarckian principle\r\nof evolution, the inheritance of functional modifications, must be\r\naccepted or rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXIII\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE TRANSMISSIBILITY OF FUNCTIONAL\r\nMODIFICATIONS\r\n\r\n Darwin's Pangenesis--Alleged proofs of functional\r\n inheritance--Mutilations not transmissible--Brown-Séquard's\r\n experiments on Epilepsy in guinea-pigs--Confusion of infection of the\r\n germ with inheritance, Pebrine, Syphilis, and Alcoholism--Does the\r\n interpretation of the facts require the assumption of the transmission\r\n of functional modifications?--Origin of instincts--The untaught\r\n pointer--Vom Rath's and Morgan's views--Attachment of the dog to his\r\n master--Fearlessness of sea-birds and seals on lonely islands--Flies\r\n and butterflies--Instincts exercised only once in the course of a\r\n lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have already said in an earlier lecture, Darwin adhered to\r\nLamarck's assumption of the transmission of functional adaptations,\r\nand perhaps the easiest way to make clear the theoretical difficulties\r\nwhich stand in the way of such an assumption is to show how Darwin\r\nsought to present this principle as theoretically conceivable and\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nDarwin was the first to think out a theory of heredity which was worthy\r\nof the name of theory, for it was not merely an idea hastily suggested,\r\nbut an attempt, though only in outline, at elaborating a definite\r\nhypothesis. His theory of 'Pangenesis' assumes that cells give rise to\r\nspecial gemmules which are infinitesimally minute, and of which each\r\ncell brings forth countless hosts in the course of its existence. Each\r\nof these gemmules can give rise to a cell similar to the one in which\r\nit was itself produced, but it cannot do this at all times, but only\r\nunder definite circumstances, namely, when it reaches 'those cells\r\nwhich precede in order of development' those that it has to give rise\r\nto. Darwin calls this the 'elective affinity' of each gemmule for\r\nthis particular kind of cell. Thus, from the beginning of development\r\nthere arises in every cell a host of gemmules, each of which virtually\r\nrepresents a specific cell. These gemmules, however, do not remain\r\nwhere they originated, but migrate from their place of origin into the\r\nblood-stream, and are carried by it in myriads to all parts of the\r\nbody. Thus they reach also the ovaries and testes and the germ-cells\r\nlying within these, penetrate into them, and there accumulate, so that\r\nthe germ-cells, in the course of life, come to contain gemmules from\r\nall the kinds of cells which have appeared in the organism, and, at\r\nthe same time, all the variations which any part may have undergone,\r\nwhether due to external or internal influences, or through use and\r\ndisuse.\r\n\r\nIn this manner Darwin sought to attribute to the germ-cells the power\r\nof giving rise, in the course of their development, to the same\r\nvariations as the individual had acquired during its lifetime in\r\nconsequence of external conditions or functional influences.\r\n\r\nI abstain from analysing the assumptions here made; their improbability\r\nand their contradictions to established facts are so great that it\r\nis not necessary to emphasize them; the theory shows plainly that it\r\nis necessary to have recourse to very improbable assumptions, if an\r\nattempt is to be made to find a theoretical basis for the transmission\r\nof acquired (somatogenic) characters. Even when Darwin formulated\r\nhis theory of Pangenesis his assumptions were hardly reconcileable\r\nwith what was known of cell-multiplication; now they are above all\r\nirreconcileable with the fact that the germ-substance never arises\r\nanew, but is always derived from the preceding generation--that is,\r\nwith the continuity of the germ-plasm.\r\n\r\nIf we were now to try to think out a theoretical justification we\r\nshould require to assume that the conditions of all the parts of\r\nthe body at every moment, or at least at every period of life, were\r\nreflected in the corresponding primary constituents of the germ-plasm\r\nand thus in the germ-cells. But, as these primary constituents are\r\nquite different from the parts themselves, they would require to vary\r\nin quite a different way from that in which the finished parts had\r\nvaried; which is very like supposing that an English telegram to China\r\nis there received in the Chinese language.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this almost insuperable theoretical obstacle, various\r\nauthors have worked out the idea that the nervous system, which\r\nconnects all parts of the body with the brain and thus also with each\r\nother, communicates these conditions to the reproductive organs, and\r\nthat thus variations may arise in the germ-cells corresponding to those\r\nwhich have taken place in remote parts of the body.\r\n\r\nEven supposing it were proved that every germ-cell in ovary or testis\r\nwas associated with a nerve-fibre, what could be transmitted to it by\r\nthe nerves, except a stronger or weaker nerve-current? There is no such\r\nthing as _qualitative_ differences in the current; how then could the\r\nprimary constituents of the germ be influenced by the nerve-current,\r\neither individually or in groups, in harmony with the organs and parts\r\nof the body corresponding to them, much less be caused to vary in a\r\nsimilar manner? Or are we to imagine that a particular nerve-path leads\r\nto every one of the countless primary constituents? Or does it make\r\nmatters more intelligible if we assume that the germ-plasm is without\r\nprimary constituents, and suppose that, after each functional variation\r\nof a part, telegraphic notice is sent to the germ-plasm by way of the\r\nbrain as to how it has to alter its 'physico-chemical constitution,'\r\nso that the descendants may receive some benefit from the acquired\r\nimprovement?\r\n\r\nI am not of the number of those who believe that we already know all,\r\nor at least nearly all, that is essential, but am rather convinced that\r\nwhole regions of phenomena are still sealed to us, and I consider it\r\nprobable that the nervous system in particular is not yet exhaustively\r\nknown to us, either in regard to its functioning or in regard to its\r\nfinest structural architecture, although I gratefully recognize the\r\nadvances in this domain that the last decades have brought about. In\r\nany case, such assumptions as I have just indicated, or similar ones,\r\nseem to me quite too improbable to furnish any foothold for progress.\r\nYet we must always remain conscious that we cannot decide as to the\r\npossibility or impossibility of any biological process whatever from\r\na purely theoretical standpoint, because we can only guess at, not\r\ndiscern, the fundamental nature of biological processes. At the close\r\nof this lecture I shall return to the question of the theoretical\r\nconceivability of an inheritance of functional adaptations; but first\r\nof all we must consider the facts and be guided by them alone. If they\r\nprove, or even make it seem probable, that such inheritance exists,\r\nthen it must be possible, and our task is no longer to deny it, but to\r\nfind out how it can come about.\r\n\r\nLet us therefore investigate the question whether an inheritance\r\nof acquired characters, that is, in the first place, of functional\r\nadaptations, is demonstrable from experience. We shall speak later on\r\nof the effect of climatic and similar influences in causing variation;\r\nthe case in regard to them is quite different, because they undoubtedly\r\naffect not only the parts of the body but the germ-cells as well.\r\n\r\nWhen we inquire into the facts which have been brought forward by\r\nthe modern adherents of the Lamarckian principle as proofs of the\r\ninheritance of acquired characters in this restricted sense, we shall\r\nfind that none of them can withstand criticism.\r\n\r\nFirst, there are the numerous reputed cases of the inheritance of\r\nmutilations and losses of whole parts of the body.\r\n\r\nIt is not without interest to note here how opinion in regard to this\r\npoint has altered in the course of the debate.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the discussion they were all brought forward as\r\nevidence of undoubted value for the Lamarckian principle.\r\n\r\nAt the Naturalists' Congress in Wiesbaden in 1887, kittens with only\r\nstumps of tails were exhibited, and they were said to have inherited\r\nthis peculiarity from their mother, whose tail, it was asserted, had\r\nbeen accidentally amputated. The newspapers reported that the case\r\nexcited great interest, and biologists of the standing of Rudolf\r\nVirchow declared it to be noteworthy, and regarded it as a proof, if\r\nall the details of it were correct. From many sides similar cases were\r\nbrought forward, intended to prove that the amputation of the tail\r\nin cats and dogs could give rise to hereditary degeneration of this\r\npart; even students' fencing-scars were said to have been occasionally\r\ntransmitted to their sons (happily not to the daughters); a mutilated\r\nor torn ear-lobe in the mother was said to have given rise to deformity\r\nof the ear in a son; an injury to a father's eye was said to have\r\ncaused complete degeneration of the eyes in his children; and deformity\r\nof a father's thumb, due to frostbite, was said to have produced\r\nmisshapen thumbs in the children and grandchildren. A multitude of\r\ncases of this kind are to be found in the older textbooks of physiology\r\nby Burdach, and above all by Blumenbach, and the majority have no\r\nmore than an anecdotal value, for they are not only related without\r\nany adequate guarantee, but even without the details indispensable to\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nAs far back as the eighteenth century the great philosopher Kant, and\r\nin our own day the anatomist Wilhelm His, gave their verdict decidedly\r\nagainst such allegations, and absolutely denied any inheritance of\r\nmutilations; and now, after a decade or more of lively debate over\r\nthe pros and cons, combined with detailed anatomical investigations,\r\ncareful testing of individual cases, and experiment, we are in a\r\nposition to give a decided negative and say _there is no inheritance of\r\nmutilations_.\r\n\r\nLet me briefly explain how this result has been reached.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the assertion that congenital stump-tails in dogs\r\nand cats depended on inherited mutilation proved to be unfounded. In\r\nnone of the cases of stump-tails brought forward could it even be\r\nproved that the tail of the relevant parent had been torn or cut off,\r\nmuch less that the occurrence, in parents or grandparents, of short\r\ntails from internal causes was excluded. At the same time anatomical\r\ninvestigation of such stump-tails as occur in cats in the Isle of Man,\r\nand in many Japanese cats, and are frequently found in the most diverse\r\nbreeds of dogs, showed that these had, in their structure, nothing\r\nin common with the remains of a tail that had been cut off, but were\r\nspontaneous degenerations of the whole tail, and are thus deformed\r\ntails, not shortened ones (Bonnet).\r\n\r\nExperiments on mice also showed that the cutting off of the tail,\r\neven when performed on both parents, does not bring about the\r\nslightest diminution in the length of tail in the descendants. I\r\nhave myself instituted experiments of this kind, and carried them\r\nout through twenty-two successive generations, without any positive\r\nresult. Corroborative results of these experiments on mice have\r\nbeen communicated by Ritzema Bos and, independently, by Rosenthal,\r\nand a corresponding series of experiments on rats, which these two\r\ninvestigators carried out, yielded the same negative results.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that all the cases which have been brought forward in\r\nsupport of an inheritance of mutilations refer to a _single_ injury\r\nto one parent, while, in the experiments, the same mutilation was\r\ninflicted on both parents through numerous generations, we must regard\r\nthese experiments as a proof that all earlier statements were based\r\neither on a fallacy or on fortuitous coincidence. This conclusion is\r\nconfirmed by all that we know otherwise of the effects of oft-repeated\r\nmutilations, as for instance the well-known mutilations and distortions\r\nwhich many peoples have practised for long, sometimes inconceivably\r\nlong, ages on their children, especially circumcision, the breaking\r\nof the incisors, the boring of holes in lip, ear, or nose, and so\r\nforth. No child of any of these races has ever been brought into the\r\nworld with one of these marks: they have to be re-impressed on every\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nThe experience of breeders agrees with this, and they therefore, as\r\nWilckens remarks, have long regarded the non-inheritance of mutilations\r\nas an established fact. Thus there are breeds of sheep in which, for\r\npurely practical reasons, the tails have been curtailed quite regularly\r\nfor about a century (Kühn); but no sheep with a stump-tail has ever\r\nbeen born in this breed. This is all the more important because there\r\nare other breeds of sheep (fat-rumped sheep) in which the lack of\r\nthe tail is a breed character; it is thus not the case that there is\r\nanything in the intrinsic nature of the tail of the sheep to prevent\r\nit becoming rudimentary. The artificially rounded ear of fox-terriers,\r\ntoo, though cut for generations, never occurs hereditarily. Mr. Postans\r\nof Eastbourne informs me that the cocks which are to be used for\r\ncock-fighting are docked of their combs and wattles beforehand, and\r\nthat this had been done for at least a century, but that no fighting\r\ncock without comb and wattles has been reared. In the same way various\r\nbreeds of dog, such as the spaniels, have had their tails cut to half\r\ntheir length regularly and in both sexes for more than a century, yet\r\nin this case there is no hereditary diminution of the length of tail.\r\nDeformed stump-tails do indeed occur in most breeds of dog, but, as I\r\nsaid before, their anatomical character is quite different from that of\r\nartificially shortened tails, moreover they may occur in breeds whose\r\ntails have not suffered from the fashion of docking, as, for instance,\r\nin the Dachshund.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore affirm that an inheritance of artificially produced\r\ndefects and mutilations is quite unproved, and in no way bears out the\r\nsupposed inheritance of functional changes.\r\n\r\nThis is now admitted by the great majority of the adherents of the\r\nLamarckian principle, and we may now regard this kind of 'proof' as\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, various sets of facts have been brought\r\nforward as proofs, and in particular the much discussed experiments of\r\nBrown-Séquard on guinea-pigs, from which it was inferred that epilepsy\r\nartificially induced could be transmitted. But these experiments do\r\nnot really prove anything in regard to the question at issue, because\r\nepileptic-like convulsions may have very various causes, and these\r\nare, for the most part, quite unknown. Since artificial epilepsy\r\ncan be induced in guinea-pigs by the most diverse injuries to the\r\ncentral or peripheral parts of the nervous system, this of itself\r\npoints to the fact that it is not a question of the mere lesion of\r\nanatomical structure, I mean, of the breaking of the continuity of\r\na definite part, and of its transmission. The result would, in any\r\ncase, differ according to whether certain centres of the brain, or\r\nhalf the spinal cord, or the main nerve-trunks were cut through. There\r\nmust, therefore, be something more needed to produce the appearance of\r\nepilepsy--some morbid process which may arise at different parts of\r\nthe nervous system, and be continued from them to the brain-centres.\r\nThis is corroborated by the fact that it takes at least fourteen days,\r\nand often from six to eight weeks, for epilepsy to develop after the\r\noperation, and that in many cases it does not develop at all. I have\r\nmade the suggestion that, during or after the operation, some kind of\r\npathogenic micro-organism might easily reach the wounded parts, and\r\nthere excite inflammation, which may extend centripetally to the brain.\r\nSimilar processes have been observed in connexion with lymph-vessels,\r\nand why should they not occur in connexion with nerves?\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to this that the guinea-pig's epilepsy may be\r\nproduced by blows on the skull, and also by a destructive compression\r\nof the _nervus ischiadicus_ through the skin, and that in both cases\r\nthe epilepsy may reappear in the following generation; and this, it\r\nis supposed, shows that the intrusion of microbes is excluded. If\r\nthis were so beyond a doubt, and if we could exclude the possibility\r\nthat there were previously various microbes within the body, which\r\ncould only penetrate into the nervous substance after the cutting\r\nor destruction of the neurilemma, nothing would be gained that\r\nwould in any way support the Lamarckian principle. One could only\r\nsay: Certain injuries to the nervous system give rise secondarily\r\nin guinea-pigs to morbid phenomena like epilepsy, and all sorts of\r\nfunctional disturbances of the nervous system often appear in the next\r\ngeneration, including in rare cases even the phenomena of epileptic\r\nconvulsions. That this is a case of the transmission of an acquired\r\nanatomical modification brought about by the injury is not only\r\nunproved, but is decidedly negatived, for the injuries themselves are\r\nnever transmitted. Thus what is transmitted must be quite different\r\nfrom what was acquired, for no one has ever detected in the offspring\r\nthe lesion of the nerve-trunk which was cut through in the parent, or\r\nany other result except the disease to which the original injury gives\r\nrise. Moreover, the inheritance of these morbid phenomena has been\r\nagain brought into dispute quite recently owing to the investigations\r\nof such experts in nervous diseases as Sommer and Binswanger, and the\r\ncorrectness of Brown-Séquard's results, which have dragged through the\r\nliterature of the subject for so long, has been emphatically denied[11].\r\n\r\n[11] See H. E. Ziegler's report in _Zool. Centralblatt_, 1900, Nos. 12\r\nand 13.\r\n\r\nClearly formulated problems, like that of the inheritance of acquired\r\ncharacters, should not be confused by bringing into them phenomena\r\nwhose causes are quite unknown. What do we know of the real causes\r\nof those central brain-irritations which give rise to the phenomena\r\nof epilepsy? It is certain enough that there are diseases which are\r\nacquired and are yet 'inherited,' but that has nothing to do with\r\nthe Lamarckian principle, because it is a question of _infection_\r\nof the germ, not of a definite variation in the constitution of the\r\ngerm. We know this with certainty in regard to the so-called Pebrine,\r\nthe silkworm disease which wrought such devastation in its time; the\r\ngerms of the pebrine organism have been demonstrated _in the egg_ of\r\nthe silk-moth; they multiply, not at once but later, in the young\r\ncaterpillar, and it is the half-grown caterpillar, or even the moth,\r\nthat succumbs to the disease.\r\n\r\nWhether in this case also the disease germs are transmitted through\r\nthe male sex-cells is not proved, as far as I am aware, but that this\r\ncan happen is shown by the transmission of syphilis from father to\r\nchild. That in this case, also, the exciting cause of the disease is a\r\nmicro-organism cannot be doubted, although it has not yet been proved.\r\nThus even the minute spermatozoon of Man can contain microbes, and\r\ntransmit them to the germ of a new individual.\r\n\r\nThis discussion of scientific questions ought not to be brought down\r\nto the level of a play upon words, by bringing forward cases like the\r\nabove as evidence for the inheritance of 'acquired characters,' as was\r\ndone, for instance, by M. Nussbaum, who cited as a proof of this the\r\nmigration of the alga-cells which live in the endoderm of the green\r\nfreshwater Hydra into the ovum, which is originally colourless, and\r\noriginates in the ectoderm of the animal (Fig. 35_B_, p. 169, vol.\r\ni). It seems to me better to make a precise distinction between the\r\ntransmission of extraneous micro-organisms through the germ-cells and\r\nthe handing on of the germ-plasm with the characters inherent in its\r\nstructure. Only the latter is inheritance in the strict scientific\r\nsense, the former is infection of the germ.\r\n\r\nStill less than the cases of inherited traumatic epilepsy can the\r\nmorbid constitution of the children of drunkards be regarded as a\r\nproof of the inheritance of somatogenic characters, though this has\r\noften been maintained. I will not lay any stress on the fact that the\r\nallegation itself is, according to the most competent observers, such\r\nas Dr. Thomas Morton[12], far from being established. But even if it\r\nwere quite certain that the numerous diseases of the nervous system,\r\namounting sometimes to mania, which are frequently observed in the\r\nchildren of drunkards, were really _caused_ by the drinking of the\r\nparents, it ought not to be overlooked that we have here to do not with\r\nthe hereditary transmission of somatic variations, but of variations\r\n_directly_ induced in the germ-plasm of the reproductive cells, for\r\nthese are exposed to the influence of the alcohol circulating in the\r\nblood, just as any other part of the body is. That by this means\r\nvariations in the germ-plasm can be brought about, and that these\r\nmay lead to morbid conditions in the children cannot be denied, and\r\nought not on _a priori_ grounds to be called in question. For we are\r\nacquainted with many other influences--climatic, for instance--which\r\ndirectly affect and cause variation in the germ-plasm. Whether this\r\nis so in the case of drunkenness, and in what manner it comes about,\r\nwhether through direct action of the alcohol, or through infection of\r\nthe germ with some microbe, we must leave to the future to decide; the\r\nwhole question is out of place here; it can in no way help us to clear\r\nup the problem with which we are now occupied.\r\n\r\n[12] Morton, 'The Problem of Heredity in Reference to Inebriety,'\r\nProceed. Soc. for the Study of Inebriety, No. 42, Nov. 1894.\r\n\r\nBut even if there were not a trace of proof of the transmissibility of\r\nfunctional modifications, that alone would not justify us in concluding\r\nthat the transmission is impossible, for many things may happen that we\r\nare not in a position to prove at present. If it could be shown that\r\nthere was a whole group of phenomena that could not be explained in any\r\nother way than on the hypothesis of such inheritance, then we should\r\nbe obliged to assume that it really occurred, although it was not\r\ndemonstrable, and, indeed, not even theoretically conceivable. This is\r\nthe standpoint of the adherents of the Lamarckian principle at present.\r\n\r\nThey say there are a great number of transformations which are simply\r\nand easily explained, if we regard them as the effects of inherited\r\nuse or disuse, but which admit only of a strained explanation, and\r\nsometimes of none at all, on the basis of natural selection, and these\r\nare not a few isolated cases, but whole categories of them.\r\n\r\nI will submit a few of these, and show at the same time why I cannot\r\nregard them as convincing, even if it be the case that we are not at\r\npresent in a position to explain them without the aid of the Lamarckian\r\nprinciple. But let me hasten to add that it is my belief that we can do\r\nthis, although certainly not without first giving a somewhat extended\r\napplication to the principle of selection.\r\n\r\nIt has often been maintained that the existence of animal instincts is\r\nin itself enough to prove that the Lamarckian principle is operative.\r\nIn one of the earlier lectures I showed that at least the greater\r\nnumber of instincts must have originated in purely reflex actions,\r\nand therefore, like these actions themselves, can only be explained\r\nthrough natural selection. A reflex action, such as coughing, sneezing,\r\nshutting of the eyelids, and so on, differs from an instinctive\r\naction in the lesser complexity and shorter duration of the series\r\nof movements liberated by a sense-impression, and also in that it\r\ndoes not require to enter into consciousness at all; but no very\r\nprecise boundary can be drawn between the two, and, in any case, both\r\ndepend, as we have already seen, on a quite analogous anatomical\r\nbasis. It is only a difference in degree whether, at the sight of a\r\nrapidly approaching object, the muscles of the eyelids contract, and\r\nby shutting the lids, protect the eye, or whether the fly, which we\r\nintend to seize with our hand, is impelled by the sight of the rapidly\r\napproaching shadow of the hand to fly quickly up. The action of the fly\r\nmay be regarded as reflex, or equally well as instinctive. But there\r\nis also only a difference in degree, not in kind, between this simple\r\naction and the complex and protracted behaviour of a mason-bee, the\r\nsight of whose colony impels her to fly out and fetch clay, with it\r\ngradually to build a neat cell, to fill this with honey, to lay an egg\r\nin it, and finally to furnish the cell with a roof of clay. Since all\r\nreflex mechanisms, and all the natural instincts of animals, contribute\r\nto the maintenance of the species, and are therefore useful, their\r\norigins must be referable to natural selection, and we have only to ask\r\nwhether they must be referred to it always, and to it alone.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that, in Man, and in the higher animals voluntary\r\nactions which are often repeated gradually acquire the character\r\nof instinctive actions. The individual movements pertaining to the\r\nparticular action are no longer each guided by the will, but a single\r\nexercise of will is enough to liberate the whole complex action, such\r\nas writing, speaking, walking, or the playing of a whole piece of\r\nmusic; frequently the will-impulse may be absent altogether, and the\r\naction be set going simply by an adequate external stimulus, as in\r\nthe case of sleep-walking, which is observed in fatigued children and\r\nsoldiers, and in somnambulists. The external stimulus is transmitted\r\nto the proper group of muscles as unfailingly as in the case of true\r\ninstincts, and this happens not only in regard to actions which,\r\nlike walking, are essential to the life of the species, but also in\r\nregard to those which have arisen from chance habits or exercises.\r\nOften a short practice is sufficient to make an action in this sense\r\ninstinctive, and the complexity of the instinct-mechanism gained by\r\nsuch practice is often astounding. Under some circumstances a person\r\nmay play a piece on the piano from the score, and yet be thinking\r\nintently of other things, and be quite unconscious of what is played.\r\nIn the same way it may happen that a person dominated by violent\r\nemotion, when trying to free himself from it by reading, may read a\r\nwhole page, line by line, without understanding in the least what has\r\nbeen read. In the last case it is not directly demonstrable that the\r\nreader has made all the complex delicate eye-movements which would be\r\nliberated by the sight of the words, but in the case of playing, the\r\nlisteners can perceive that the piece is correctly played, and thus\r\nthat the stimulus exercised by each note on the retina of the eye\r\nis translated into the complex muscular movement of arm and finger,\r\ncorresponding both to the pitch and the duration of the note, and to\r\nthe simultaneousness of several notes.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases it is probably not always quite new paths which\r\nare established in the brain, but use is made of particular tracks\r\nin the innumerable nerve-paths already existing in the nerve-cells\r\n(neurons) which are 'more thoroughly trodden' by practice, so that\r\nthe distribution of the nerve-current takes place more easily along\r\nthem than along others[13]. This much-used metaphor does not indicate\r\nthe actual structural changes which have taken place, but it serves\r\nat least to indicate that we have to do with material changes in the\r\nultimate living elements of the nerve-substance (nerve-biophors)\r\nwhether these changes be in position or in quality. Now, if such\r\nbrain-structures and mechanisms acquired through exercise in the\r\nindividual life could be transmitted, new instincts would certainly\r\narise in this way, and many naturalists hold this view still.\r\n\r\n[13] This, however, is by no means intended to cast doubt on the\r\npossibility that quite new paths may arise during the individual life,\r\nas is made probable by the recent investigations of Apáthy, Bethe, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIf the inheritance of acquired characters had already been proved in\r\nother ways, we could not refuse to admit that it might play a part in\r\nthe higher animals in the modification and new formation of instincts.\r\nWe should then have to admit that habits can be inherited, and that\r\ninstincts actually are or may be, as they have often been said to be,\r\ninherited habits. But to make the converse conclusion, and to infer\r\nfrom the result of the brain-exercise in the individual life and its\r\nsimilarity to inborn instincts that the latter also depend on inherited\r\nexercise, and that there must therefore be inheritance of acquired\r\ncharacters, is hardly admissible.\r\n\r\nIt might be all very well if there were no other explanation! But as\r\ninstincts depend on material brain-mechanisms which are variable, like\r\nevery other part of the body, and as, furthermore, they are essential\r\nto the existence of the species, and, down to the minutest detail, are\r\nadapted to the circumstances of life, there is no obstacle in the way\r\nof referring their origin and transformation to processes of selection.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that the results of training, for instance in\r\ndogs, can be inherited, since the untaught young pointer points at\r\nthe game, and the young sheep-dog runs round and barks at the flock\r\nof sheep without biting them. It is, however, often forgotten that,\r\nnot only have these breeds arisen under the influence of artificial\r\nselection by Man, but that they are even now strictly selected. My\r\ncolleague and friend, Dr. Otto vom Rath, who unhappily died all too\r\nsoon for Science, and who was not only a capable investigator, but\r\nan experienced sportsman, told me that huntsmen distinguish very\r\ncarefully between the better and the inferior young in a litter, and\r\nthat by no means every whelp of a pair of pointers can be used for\r\nhunting game-birds. Lloyd Morgan points out the same thing, and he is\r\nundoubtedly a competent judge in the domain of instinct; he confirms\r\nthe statement that the pointer 'often points at the quarry, it may be a\r\nlark's nest, without instruction,' but he says at the same time, that\r\nthe power is inborn in very varying degrees, and that, in his opinion,\r\nselection undoubtedly plays a part.\r\n\r\nIt must not, therefore, be believed that the habit of the pointer\r\ndepends on training; it is only strengthened in each individual by\r\ntraining, but it depends on an innate predisposition to creep up\r\nto the game, and is thus a form of the hunting instinct. Man has\r\ntaken advantage of this, and has increased it, but has certainly not\r\ningrafted it into the breed by whipping. And something similar will be\r\nfound to be true in all cases of so-called inheritance of the effects\r\nof training. It must not be forgotten what astounding results can\r\nbe achieved in the individual by training. The elephant is the best\r\nexample of this, for it only exceptionally breeds in captivity, and\r\nall the thousands of 'domesticated' elephants in India are tamed wild\r\nelephants. Yet they are as gentle and docile as the horse, which has\r\nbeen domesticated for thousands of years; they perform all kinds of\r\ntasks with the greatest patience and carefulness, in many cases without\r\nbeing under constant superintendence. They are indeed animals of great\r\nintelligence; they understand what is required of them, and they\r\naccommodate themselves readily to new conditions of life.\r\n\r\nThe attachment of the dog to its master and to Man generally has\r\noften been cited as a proof of the origin of a new instinct by the\r\ninheritance of acquired habitude; but the dog is a sociable animal\r\neven in a wild state, and by living in co-operative association with\r\nMan it has transferred its sociable affections to him. We find exactly\r\nthe same thing in the elephant which has been caught wild and tamed.\r\nIt is particularly emphasized by those who have accompanied animal\r\ntransports in Africa that the young elephants are wild and malicious\r\ntowards the blacks who teased and maltreated them, but complaisant and\r\nharmless towards the whites who treated them kindly. The attachment of\r\nelephants to their keepers and to every one who shows them kindness is\r\nfamiliar enough; it does not depend on a newly acquired impulse, but\r\non the sociable impulse inherent in the species, which, in the wild\r\nstate, causes them to live in fairly large companies, and on their\r\ninoffensive, timid, and, we may almost say, affectionate disposition.\r\n\r\nOf course it is easy enough to give an imaginative theoretical\r\ninterpretation of the origin of a new instinct from a newly acquired\r\nhabit. We have often heard that sailors have found the birds in distant\r\nuninhabited islands quite free from fear; they let themselves be struck\r\ndown with cudgels without attempting to escape. The extermination of\r\nthe Dodo three centuries ago is a well-known example of this. Chun, in\r\nhis magnificent work on the German Deep Sea Expedition of 1898, has\r\nrecently communicated numerous interesting examples of the indifference\r\nof birds towards Man when they have not learned what his presence\r\nmeans: thus the sea-birds of Kerguelen, penguins, cormorants, gulls,\r\n'kelp-pigeons' (_Chionis_), and others, behaved towards Man very much\r\nlike the tame geese of our poultry yards. Even enormous mammals like\r\nthe 'sea-elephant,' a seal with a proboscis-like prolongation of the\r\nnose, neither attempted to escape nor showed any hostility to man, but\r\nquietly let itself be caught. Similar tales were told by Steller in\r\n1799, after he had been obliged to pass a winter with his sailors on an\r\nisland in the Behring Straits. The numerous gigantic sea-cows (_Rhytina\r\nstelleri_) which lived there were so confiding that they allowed the\r\nboat to come quite up to them, and the sailors were able to kill many\r\nof them from time to time, using their flesh for food. But towards the\r\nend of the winter the animals began to be shy, and, in the following\r\nwinter, when other sailors to the polar regions endeavoured to hunt\r\nthem too, it was very difficult to secure them; they had recognized\r\nman as an enemy, and fled from him when they saw him from afar. Thus\r\nthe same individuals which had earlier carelessly allowed man to come\r\nup to them now avoided him as an enemy. _This was not instinct, it was\r\na behaviour controlled by the will and founded on experience._ But it\r\nwould soon become 'instinctive' if the meeting with the enemy were\r\noften repeated, just like the winding-up of a watch, which is often\r\ndone at a wrong time, for instance, on changing clothes during the day,\r\nand thus without reflection. It is quite easy to conceive that if the\r\nmaterial brain-adaptation which causes flight without reflection at\r\nthe sight of man were transmissible, the flight-instinct might become\r\na congenital instinct in the species in question. But this assumption\r\nis unfounded; for, as is shown by the case of the sea-cow, we do not\r\nrequire it where the animal is of sufficient intelligence to perform by\r\nits own discernment the action necessary to its existence. The action\r\nmay thus become 'instinctive' through exercise and imitation in the\r\n_individual_ life, without however attaining to transmissibility.\r\n\r\nBut in many cases this is not enough, namely, in all cases in which the\r\ndegree of intelligence is not sufficiently high, or where the flight\r\nmovement must follow so rapidly that it would be too late if it had to\r\nbe regulated by the will, as, for instance, the shutting of the lids\r\nwhen the eye is threatened, or the flight of the fly or the butterfly\r\nwhen an enemy approaches. Both fly and butterfly would be lost in every\r\ncase if they had voluntarily to set the flight-movement going after\r\nthey became conscious of danger. If they had first of all to find\r\nout from whom danger threatened no individual would escape an early\r\ndeath, and the species would die out. But they possess an instinct\r\nwhich impels them to fly up with lightning speed, and in an opposite\r\ndirection, whenever they have a visual perception of the rapid approach\r\nof any object of whatever nature. For this reason they are difficult\r\nto catch. I once watched the play of a cat, ordinarily very clever at\r\ncatching, as she attempted to seize a peacock-butterfly (_Vanessa Io_),\r\nwhich settled several times on the ground in front of her. Quietly and\r\nslowly she crept within springing distance, but even during the spring\r\nthe butterfly flew up just before her nose and escaped every time, and\r\nthe cat gave it up after three attempts.\r\n\r\nIn this case the beginning of the action cannot lie in a voluntary\r\naction, for the insect cannot know what it means to be caught and\r\nkilled, and the same is true of innumerable still lower animal forms,\r\nthe hermit-crabs and the Serpulids, which withdraw with lightning\r\nspeed into their houses, and so forth. It seems to me important\r\ntheoretically, that the same action can be liberated at one time by\r\nthe will, at another by the inborn instinct-mechanism. In both cases\r\nquite similar association-changes in the nerve-centres must lie at\r\nthe root of the animal's action, but in the first case these are\r\ndeveloped only in the course of the individual life by exercise, while\r\nin the second they are inborn. In the former, they are confined to the\r\nindividual, and must be acquired in each generation by imitation of\r\nolder individuals (tradition) and by inference from experience, in the\r\nlatter they are inherited as a stable character of the species.\r\n\r\nIt has been maintained by many that the origin of instincts\r\nthrough processes of selection is not conceivable, because it is\r\nimprobable that the appropriate variations in the nervous system,\r\nwhich are necessary for the selective establishment of the relevant\r\nbrain-mechanism, should occur fortuitously. But this is an objection\r\ndirected against the principle of selection itself, and one which\r\npoints, I think, to an incompleteness in it, as it was understood by\r\nDarwin and Wallace. The same objection can be made to every adaptation\r\nof an organ through natural selection; it is always doubtful whether\r\nthe useful variations will present themselves, as long as they are\r\ndue solely to chance, as the discoverers of the selective principle\r\nassumed. We shall attempt later to fill up this gap in the theory,\r\nbut, in the meantime, I should like to point out that the process\r\nof selection offers the only possible explanation of the origin of\r\ninstincts, since their origin through modifications of voluntary\r\nactions into instinctive actions, with subsequent transmission of the\r\ninstinct-mechanism due to exercise in the individual life, has been\r\nshown to be untenable.\r\n\r\nIf any one is still unconvinced of this, I can only refer to the cases\r\nwe have already discussed of instincts which are only exercised once\r\nin a lifetime, since, in these, the only factor that can transform\r\na voluntary action into an instinctive one is absent, namely, the\r\nfrequent repetition of the action. In this case, if any explanation\r\nis to be attempted at all, it can only be through natural selection,\r\nand as we have assumed once for all that our world does admit of\r\nexplanation, we may say, _these instincts have arisen through natural\r\nselection_.\r\n\r\nEven though it may be difficult to think out in detail the process of\r\nthe gradual origin of such an instinctive activity, exercised once in\r\na lifetime, such as that, for instance, which impels the caterpillar\r\nto spin its intricate cocoon, which it makes only once, without ever\r\nhaving seen one, and thus without being able to imitate the actions\r\nwhich produce it, we must not push aside the only conceivable solution\r\nof the problem on that account, for then we should have to renounce\r\nall hope of a scientific interpretation of the phenomenon. We may\r\nask, however, whether there is not something lacking in our present\r\nconception of natural selection, and how it comes about that useful\r\nvariations always crop up and are able to increase.\r\n\r\nBut if we must explain, through natural selection, such complex series\r\nof actions as are necessary to the making of the cocoon of the silkworm\r\nor of the Saturnia moth (_Saturnia carpini_), what reason have we\r\nfor not referring other instincts also to selection, even if they be\r\nrepeated several times, or often, in the course of a lifetime? It is\r\nillogical to drag in any other factor, if this one, which has been\r\nproved to operate, is sufficient for an explanation.\r\n\r\nThus, as far as instincts are concerned, there is no necessity to\r\nmake the assumption of an inheritance of functional changes, any more\r\nthan there is in regard to any purely morphological modifications. As\r\nthe instincts only exercised once show us that even very complicated\r\nimpulses may arise without any inheritance of habit, that is, without\r\ninheritance of functional modification, so there are among purely\r\nmorphological characters not a few which, though effective, are purely\r\npassive, which are of use to the organism only through their existence,\r\nand not through any real activity, so that they cannot be referred\r\nto exercise, and therefore cannot be due to the transmission of the\r\nresults of exercise. And, if this be the case, then transformations\r\nof the most diverse parts may take place without the inheritance of\r\nacquired characters, that is, of functional modifications, and there is\r\nno reason for dragging in an unproved mode of inheritance to explain\r\na process which can quite well be explained without it. For if any\r\npart whatever can be transformed solely through natural selection,\r\nwhy, since there is general variability of all parts, should this be\r\nconfined to the passive organs alone, when the active ones are equally\r\nvariable, and equally important in the struggle for existence?\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, many of these passive parts among animals; I need\r\nonly recall the coloration of animals, the whole set of skeletal parts,\r\nso diversely formed, of the Arthropods, the legs, wings, antennæ,\r\nspines, hairs, claws, and so on, none of which can be changed by the\r\ninherited results of exercise, because they are no longer capable of\r\nmodification by exercise; they are ready before they are used; they\r\ncome into use only after they have been hardened by exposure to the\r\nair, and are no longer plastic; they are at most capable of being\r\nused up or mutilated. Finally, even so convinced an advocate of the\r\nLamarckian principle as Herbert Spencer has stated that among plants\r\nthe great majority of characters and distinctive features cannot be\r\nexplained by it, but only through the principle of selection; all the\r\ndiverse protective arrangements of individual parts, like thorns,\r\nbristles, hairs, the felt-hairs of certain leaves, the shells of nuts,\r\nthe fat and oil in seeds, the varied arrangements for the dispersal\r\nof seeds, and so on, all operate by their presence alone, not through\r\nany real activity which causes them to vary, and the results of which\r\nmight be transmitted. An acacia covered all over with thorns seldom\r\nrequires to use its weapons even once, and if a hungry ruminant does\r\nprick itself on the thorns it is only a few of these which are thus\r\n'exercised,' the rest remain untouched.\r\n\r\nBut since all these parts have originated notwithstanding their\r\npassivity, there must be a principle which evokes them in relation to\r\nthe necessities of the conditions of life, and this can only be natural\r\nselection, that is, the self-regulation of variations in reference to\r\nutility. And if there is this principle, we require no other to explain\r\nwhat is already explained.\r\n\r\nI can quite well understand, however, that many naturalists, and\r\nespecially palæontologists, find it difficult to accept this\r\nconclusion. If we think only of those parts that actively function,\r\nand thus change by reason of their function, being strengthened by use\r\nand weakened and diminished in size by disuse, and if, further, we\r\nfollow these parts through the history of whole geological epochs, we\r\nmay certainly get the impression that the exercise of the parts has\r\ndirectly caused their phyletic evolution. The direction prescribed by\r\nutility in the course of the individual life and in the phylogeny is\r\nthe same, and the intra-selection, that is, the selection of tissues\r\nwithin the individual animal, leads towards the same improvements\r\nas the selection of 'persons.' Thus it appears as if the phyletic\r\nvariations followed those of the individual life, while in reality the\r\nreverse is true; the changes arising from variations in the _germ are\r\nprimary, and they determine the course of phylogenesis_, while the\r\ntissue-selection in the individual life only elaborates and improves,\r\naccording to the demands made upon it, the material afforded by the\r\nprimordial equipment of the germ.\r\n\r\nThe American palæontologist, Osborn, cites the case of the horse's\r\nfeet as an example in support of his view that modification brought\r\nabout by use in the individual life must be transmitted in order that\r\nthe phyletic transformations may be brought about, but this example\r\nis perhaps the best that could be chosen to prove the contrary. He\r\nsupposes that, in every young horse, the means of locomotion are\r\nimproved at every step, so to speak, through the contact with the\r\nground, and I am quite willing to admit that this is so. But that only\r\nproves that, even now, an elaboration and improvement of the equipment\r\nwhich the germ affords is indispensable, as it has been at all times\r\nand in all animals, and thus that, notwithstanding the enormous number\r\nof generations which our modern horse has behind it, the functional\r\nacquirements of the individual have not yet been impressed upon the\r\ngerm. Why not? Because the horse becomes perfect without this, and\r\nthere was no reason why personal selection should perfect the primary\r\nconstituents of the germ still further, since the finishing touch of\r\nperfection through use is readily afforded by the conditions of each\r\nindividual life.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when Osborn, Cope, and other palæontologists emphasize that,\r\nin phyletic evolutionary series, _definite paths of evolutionary_\r\nchange are adhered to, and are not deviated from either to right or to\r\nleft, they are undoubtedly right, but the conclusion which they draw is\r\nnot justifiable, whether they assume with Nägeli that there is a power\r\nof development, a principle of perfecting, or whether, as Osborn does,\r\nthey assume the transmission of the modifications brought about through\r\nuse in the individual life. There remains a third possibility, that\r\nthe quiet and constant evolution in a definite direction is guided by\r\nselection, and as, in passively useful parts, that principle alone is\r\nadmissible, I see no justification for assuming it to be inoperative\r\nin regard to those which are actively functional. All these variations\r\nwhich have led up, for instance, to the modern form of the horse's foot\r\nare useful; if they were not, they could not have been produced either\r\nby use or by disuse in the individual life.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, here again, we are justified in inquiring whether the\r\nassumption of 'chance' germinal variations, which we have hitherto made\r\nwith Darwin and Wallace, affords a sufficient basis for selection.\r\nOsborn says very neatly in this connexion, 'We see with Weismann and\r\nGalton the element of chance; but the dice appear to be loaded, and in\r\nthe long run turn \"sixes\" up. Here arises the question: What loads the\r\ndice?'\r\n\r\nUntil recently we might have answered, 'external conditions'; it is\r\nthey that load the dice one-sidedly, and condition that the same\r\nstraight path of phylogenesis is adhered to, and exactly the same\r\ndirection of variations is preferred and maintained. It has to be\r\nasked, however, whether this answer, which is certainly not absolutely\r\nincorrect, is sufficient by itself, whether the dice are not falsified\r\nand one-sidedly loaded in another sense, so that they always throw a\r\npreponderating number of the useful variations. We shall attempt very\r\nsoon to solve this problem, but in the meantime I must refer to another\r\nargument in favour of assuming the Lamarckian principle, perhaps\r\nthe most important and it may be thought the most difficult of all\r\nto refute, the so-called co-adaptation of the parts of an organism,\r\nthat is, the fitting together of many individual organs for a common\r\npurposeful functioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXIV\r\n\r\nOBJECTIONS TO THE THESIS THAT FUNCTIONAL MODIFICATIONS ARE NOT\r\nTRANSMITTED\r\n\r\n Giant stag as an example of co-adaptation or 'harmonious\r\n adaptation'--This occurs even in passively functioning parts--Skeleton\r\n of Arthropods--Stridulating organ of ants and crickets--Limbs\r\n of the mole-cricket--Wing-venation--Colorations which form\r\n mimetic pictures--Harmonious adaptations in worker-bees and\r\n ants--Degeneration of their wings and ovaries--The quality of food\r\n acts as a liberating stimulus--Vom Rath's case of drones fed with\r\n royal food--Transition-forms between females and workers--Wasmann's\r\n explanation of these--The Amazon ants--Two kinds of workers--Appendix:\r\n Zehnder on the case of ants--On the skeleton of Arthropods--Hering's\r\n interpretation of Ehrlich's Ricin experiments--Hering's position in\r\n regard to the transmission of functional modifications.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Herbert Spencer, the English philosopher, who first brought\r\nthe argument of co-adaptation into the field against my view of the\r\nnon-inheritance of functionally acquired modifications. He pointed\r\nout that many, if not, indeed, most modifications of bodily parts, to\r\nbe effective, implied further changes, often very numerous, in other\r\nparts, and these latter must therefore have changed _simultaneously_\r\nwith the part which was being changed under the control of natural\r\nselection; this, however, is only conceivable as due to an inheritance\r\nof the changes caused by use, since a simultaneous alteration of so\r\nmany parts through natural selection would be impossible. If, for\r\ninstance, the antlers of our modern stag were to grow to the size of\r\nthose of the Giant Stag of the Irish peat-bogs, which measured over\r\nten feet across from tip to tip, this would mean--as has already been\r\nshown--a simultaneous thickening of the skull, and to bear the heavy\r\nburden, a strengthening of the _ligamentum nuchæ_, of the muscles of\r\nthe neck and back, of the bones of the legs and their muscles, and,\r\nfinally, of all the nerves supplying the muscles; and how could all\r\nthis happen simultaneously with, and in exact proportion to the growth\r\nof the antlers, if it depended--as natural selection assumes--on chance\r\nvariations of all these parts? What if the appropriately favourable\r\nvariation in one of these organs did not occur? A harmonious variation\r\nof all the parts--bones, muscles, nerves, ligaments--which unite in a\r\ncommon activity, is an inadmissible assumption, because, in many cases,\r\nsuch co-operating groups of organs have in the course of evolution\r\ndeveloped in opposite directions. In the giraffe, for instance, the\r\nfore-legs are longer than the hind-legs, which is the reverse of what\r\nobtains in the majority of ruminants; in the kangaroo the hind-legs,\r\non the contrary, have developed to a disproportionate size, while\r\nthe fore-legs have degenerated into relatively small grasping arms.\r\nCo-operating parts, like the fore and hind limbs, may thus follow\r\nopposite paths of evolution; their variations need not always be\r\ndirected to the same end.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty presented by these so-called co-adaptations or\r\nharmonious correlations cannot be denied, and we must also admit\r\nthat, if the results of exercise were inherited, the explanation of\r\nthe phenomenon would, in many cases--but not, indeed, in all--be\r\neasy, because the adaptation of the secondarily varying parts in each\r\nindividual life would correspond exactly to the altered function of\r\nthe part, and would be transmitted to the descendants, and in them\r\nwould again be subject to such a degree of variation, according to the\r\nprinciple of histonal selection, as might be conditioned by the further\r\nprogress of the primary variation. The simplicity of the explanation\r\nis striking, if only it were at the same time correct! But there are\r\nwhole series of facts, or rather of groups of facts, which prove that\r\nthe causes of co-adaptation do not lie in the inheritance of functional\r\nmodifications, and this must be recognized, even though we may not\r\nyet be in a position to state the causes of co-adaptation, and to say\r\nwhether natural selection suffices to explain it or not.\r\n\r\nI must first point out that co-adaptations occur not only in _actively,\r\nbut also in passively functioning parts_. Very numerous instructive\r\nexamples are to be found among the Arthropods, whose whole skeleton\r\nbelongs to this category. It has been objected that this is not wholly\r\npassive, but that, like the bones of vertebrates, it is stimulated by\r\nthe contraction of the muscles and incited to functional reaction,\r\nand that it thickens at places where strong muscles are inserted, and\r\nbecomes or remains thin where it is not exposed to any strain from\r\nthe muscles. But this is not the case, for the chitinous skeleton\r\ncan only offer resistance to the muscular contractions when it is no\r\nlonger soft, as it is immediately after it is secreted. As soon as it\r\nhas become hard, it can no longer be altered, and can at most be worn\r\naway externally by long use. The proof of this lies in the necessity\r\nfor moulting, which is indispensable to all Arthropods as long as they\r\ncontinue to grow, but does not occur later. Every one who has followed\r\nthe growth of an insect or a crustacean knows well that the moultings\r\nor ecdyses are often accompanied by great changes, and hardly ever\r\noccur without some slight changes in the form of the body, especially\r\nof the limbs, with their teeth, bristles, spines, and so on. These\r\nnew or transformed parts are formed before the throwing-off of the\r\nold chitinous shell, and under its protection, and they are brought\r\nabout by an elaboration or transformation of the living soft matrix\r\nof the skeleton, the hypodermis, which consists of cells, and is the\r\ntrue skin. They must thus have arisen in the ancestors of our modern\r\nArthropods in the same way, that is, not by a gradual modification\r\n_during_ use, but by a slight sudden transformation before use. The\r\nsteps in the transformation may have been very small, a bristle may\r\nhave become a little longer in the second stage of life than it was\r\nin the first, or instead of five bristles a particular spot may bear\r\nsix in the second or third stage of life; but the variations in the\r\nphyletic development must always be caused by germ-variations which\r\neffect from within the variation in the relevant stage of development.\r\nBut the part which has varied can only function after it has become\r\nfirm and immodifiable.\r\n\r\nIf these circumstances be kept clearly in mind, they furnish a quite\r\noverwhelming mass of proof against the views of the Lamarckians.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is not even true that the thickest parts of the\r\nexternal skeleton are those at which the muscles are inserted. The\r\nwing-covers of beetles offer the best proof to the contrary, for\r\nthere are no muscles at all in them, yet they are, in many species,\r\nthe hardest and thickest part of the whole chitinous coat of mail.\r\nThe reason is not far to seek; they protect the wings and the soft\r\nskin of the back, which lies concealed beneath them, and the muscles\r\nare inserted in this!--a relation which can be explained only by its\r\nsuitability to the end, and not as due to any direct effect.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember the origin--which we have just described--of the\r\nexternal skeleton from the soft layer of cells underneath it, the\r\nthickness of the chitinous skeleton, which is very different at\r\ndifferent places in the same animal, but always adapted to its end,\r\nfurnishes a case of co-adaptation in parts which have a purely passive\r\nfunction. The thickened part cannot be due to the insertion of a\r\nmuscle, but it is always there in advance, from internal causes, so\r\nthat the muscle finds sufficient resistance. Close to it there may lie,\r\nperhaps, the edge of a segment, and at this spot the chitinous skeleton\r\nbecomes almost suddenly thinned to a joint membrane capable of being\r\nbent or folded, not _because_ there was no pull from the muscles at\r\nthis spot, but in order that the two segments may be connected movably.\r\nThus, nowhere in the whole body of the Arthropod can the adaptation\r\nof the skeleton, in regard to thickness and power of resistance, be\r\nregulated by function itself, but only by processes of selection\r\nwhich imparted to each spot the thickness it required, in order to be\r\neffective in its function, whether that be offering resistance to the\r\nstrain of the muscles, or giving suppleness to a joint, or affording\r\nthe necessary hardness for biting the prey, or for boring into wood or\r\nearth, or merely for protecting the animal from external injuries.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many individual functions of the Arthropods the\r\nexercise of which depends on the simultaneous change of several\r\nskeletal parts; as, for instance, many of the 'singing' or vocal\r\napparatuses in insects. In quite recent times such vocal organs have\r\nbeen discovered in ants, in which they consist of a small striated\r\nregion on the surface of the third abdominal segment, and a sharp ridge\r\non the segment in front; the latter is rubbed against the former by the\r\nmovements of the two segments. Quite a similar 'stridulating organ' has\r\nlong been known in the bee-ant (_Mutilla_), and the whistling sound\r\nproduced by it is easily heard by our ears; moreover August Forel has\r\nheard it in the large wood-ant (_Camponotus ligniperdus_), and has\r\ndescribed it as an 'alarm-signal,' which the animals give each other\r\non the approach of danger--an observation which has recently been\r\nconfirmed by Wasmann and extended by Robert Wroughton in regard to\r\nIndian ants. All these arrangements for producing sound depend always\r\non two organs, of which one resembles the bow, the other the strings\r\nof a violin; the one is of no value without the other, and they must\r\ntherefore have developed simultaneously, yet they cannot have arisen\r\nthrough use, and the inheritance of the results of use, because they\r\nare both dead chitinous parts, which are never strengthened by rubbing\r\nagainst each other with the movements of the abdomen, but are rather\r\nworn away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91 (repeated). Hind-leg of a Grasshopper\r\n(_Stenobothrus protorma_), after Graber. _fe_, femur. _ti_, tibia.\r\n_ta_, tarsal joints. _schr_, the stridulating ridge.]\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the chirping organs of grasshoppers, beetles,\r\nand crickets; in all cases they consist of two different parts,\r\nwhich together produce a sound, and which therefore must have arisen\r\nsimultaneously, and the origin of which cannot be referred to the\r\ninheritance of the results of exercise, but rather to selection. It is\r\nthus possible that co-adaptation of at least two parts may take place\r\neven when the hypothetical Lamarckian principle is altogether excluded.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that we have here a case of two parts adapted to each\r\nother, that is, strictly speaking, understating the case, for, in the\r\ncrickets and locusts, for instance, there is a whole series of peg-like\r\nchitinous papillæ (Fig. 86), the so-called 'bridge,' each of which\r\nmust have arisen by itself through variation of the corresponding\r\nspot of skin. At least I can see no ground for the assumption that\r\nthe chitinous surfaces on which the 'bridge' is now placed would\r\nnecessarily, from internal reasons, have varied precisely in the line\r\nof the bridge as it has done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102. Brush and comb on the leg of a Bee (_Nomada_).\r\n_tib_, end of the tibia. _t^1_, first tarsal joint with the brush and\r\nits comb (_tak_). Between these and the tibial spine (_tisp_) with its\r\nlappet (_L_) the cross-section of an antenna (_At_) is indicated. Drawn\r\nfrom a preparation by Dr. Petrunkewitsch.]\r\n\r\nInstructive examples of the co-adaptation of several parts to a common\r\naction in organs which are not subject to the Lamarckian principle\r\nare afforded by the diverse arrangements for cleaning the antennæ the\r\nbearers of the smelling-organ which are so important to the life of\r\ninsects (Fig. 102). Here even the adaptation of an indented area on\r\nthe tibia of the anterior leg to the cylindrical form of the antenna\r\nwhich passes through it, is sometimes so striking (Fig. 102, _tak_)\r\nthat it might be thought that it must have arisen through a gradual\r\nwearing out; yet this is impossible, since we have to do with hard\r\ndead chitinous surfaces, and moreover not with a solid mass, like a\r\nhone, which is worn down by the knife, but with a hollow, thin-walled\r\ntube. In ants, bees, and ichneumon-flies this minute, semi-circular\r\nindentation contains small, pointed, triangular saw-teeth, closely\r\nset like those of a comb (_tak_), and the apparatus is made usable\r\nby the fact that a firm spine (_tisp_), fused to the end of the\r\ntibia, overhangs the notch and presses the antenna towards it. In\r\nmany species this spine is double, or it is furnished with a thin\r\ncomb or lappet (Fig. 102, _L_), or with rows of teeth, or with short\r\nbristles; in short, it may be equipped in the most different ways. Not\r\ninfrequently, as in wasps of the genera _Sphex_, _Scolia_, _Ammophila_,\r\nthe spine itself is also bent in a semicircle on the surface directed\r\ntowards the notch, and this may be effected in very different ways,\r\neither by a bending of the whole thickness of the spine, or by the\r\npresence of a comb which is concave on its inner surface. I should\r\nnever come to an end if I were to enumerate all the remarkable details\r\nwhich may be found in the two main parts of this apparatus, and which\r\nshow very clearly how essential a co-operation of the two is in\r\nfulfilling the function of cleaning the antennæ. This fitting together\r\nof the two main parts cannot have been brought about in accordance with\r\nthe Lamarckian principle; the adaptation must therefore have come about\r\nin some other way.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is shown by the legs and other appendages of insects and\r\ncrustaceans, which are adapted for the most diverse functions, and the\r\nindividual sections of which must be correlated if the function is to\r\nbe possible. Let us consider only the claw structures in crustaceans\r\nand scorpions. Here, too, it seems as if the outgrowth of the last\r\njoint of the leg, which functions as the arm of the claw, must have\r\narisen as a direct effect of use, through the pressure of an object\r\nheld fast by the last joint, the movable half of the claw. Frequently,\r\nmoreover, tooth-like protuberances occur on the fixed blade of the\r\nclaw (Fig. 103). But how could these have arisen as a direct effect\r\nof pressure, since they are always preformed during the soft state of\r\nthe appendage _before use_, and are only made use of after it is fully\r\nhardened. The soft crustaceans, the so-called 'butter-crabs' which\r\nhave just cast their shells, creep carefully away and avoid using\r\ntheir limbs until they have become hard again. Here, too, we have the\r\nco-adaptation of two parts which vary independently, and which cannot\r\nbe affected by the Lamarckian principle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103. Claw (_Sch_) on the leg of a 'Beach-fly,' an\r\nAmphipod Crustacean (_Orchestia_). _I_, _II_, the two first joints.\r\n_uA_, the lower blade of the claw, a non-mobile prolongation of the\r\npenultimate joint. _oA_, the upper blade of the claw, the movable\r\nlast joint; the tubercles and indentations of the two blades fit one\r\nanother. After F. Müller.]\r\n\r\nBut the appendages furnish more complex examples of mutual adaptation.\r\nThus the individual sections of the anterior leg of the mole-cricket\r\n(_Gryllotalpa_) have varied greatly, yet quite differently, and the\r\nwhole together forms a most effective digging-tool. With it the animal\r\ndigs out the earth before it to right and to left, and to do this\r\nit makes with both legs simultaneous outward movements, which are\r\notherwise quite unusual among insects, and does so with such strength\r\nthat Rösel von Rosenhof saw two bodies each weighing three pounds\r\npushed away in this manner. In this case four chief parts of the leg\r\n(Fig. 104), the coxa (_cox_), the femur (_fe_), the tibia (_tib_),\r\nand the tarsi (_tars_) are so adapted to each other in form, joints,\r\nthickness of skeleton, and size, that they cannot have varied otherwise\r\nthan in relation to each other, but each piece has done so in an\r\nindividual manner. Most remarkable of all is the short broad tibia,\r\nequipped with four large, hard teeth, which has to perform the digging\r\nin the ground after the manner of a spade, while the disproportionately\r\nthin and weak tarsal joints, the last of which bears two perfectly\r\nstraight spines instead of claws, are directed upwards, and do not\r\ntouch the ground, being no longer used for walking. Rösel supposed,\r\nprobably correctly, that they are used for cleaning the spade when it\r\nbecomes clogged up with earth, since the animal cannot clean it with\r\nits mouth. These quite unusually formed parts of the limb cannot have\r\nbecome what they are as the direct results of use, because, for one\r\nthing, it would have been not their broad surfaces, but their narrow\r\nedges, which would most easily cut through the earth, that would have\r\nbeen directed outwards. The peculiar curving, first concave, then\r\nconvex, of the outer surface of the digging foot is exactly what is\r\nbest adapted for cutting into the earth and for the pushing aside which\r\nfollows, but it is not what it would have become if the chitin-wall had\r\nyielded to the pressure of the earth and adapted itself to it. But,\r\nas we are again dealing with the chitinous skeleton, there can be no\r\nquestion of the direct effect of use, and, it seems to me, it must be\r\nadmitted that here we have a case of co-adaptation of at least seven\r\ndifferent parts, which have varied independently of each other, without\r\nany assistance from the Lamarckian principle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104. Digging leg of the Mole-cricket\r\n(_Gryllotalpa_). _cox_, coxa attaching the limb to the thorax. _fe_,\r\nthe short broad femur. _tib_, the tibia forming a broad spade with six\r\nlarge sharp teeth. _tars_, the tarsal joints, which are turned upwards\r\nand cannot be used in locomotion. After Rösel.]\r\n\r\nBut much more complicated cases than this might be cited, if we were in\r\na position to estimate exactly the functional value of the individual\r\nparts of the wing-venation in the different insects, for it is well\r\nknown that this venation serves the systematist as a basis for the\r\ndefinition of genera, especially in Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. That\r\nis to say, it varies from genus to genus in a characteristic manner,\r\nobviously corresponding to the differences in the wing-form, and in\r\nthe flight itself. But, unfortunately, we are still far from being\r\nable to make more than quite general hypotheses as to the meaning of\r\nthe lengthening and strengthening, or conversely, the degeneration or\r\nelimination, of this or that vein. From extreme cases, however, as for\r\ninstance the rich venation in good fliers with large wings, and the\r\nscanty venation in poor fliers with small wings, we learn at least so\r\nmuch, that the degree and even the manner of venation bears a definite\r\nrelation to the function of the wing, and this we might have assumed.\r\nBut these wing-veins, in as far as they serve as a support for the\r\nweak wing-membrane, are purely chitinous structures, skeletal parts\r\nwhich are not even renewed from time to time like the skeletal parts\r\nof the leg and many other parts of the insect. As they are laid down\r\nat first in the pupa as soft strings of cells, so they remain, and\r\nthey only begin to be used when they are completely hardened. _They\r\ncan therefore never have been caused to vary through use in the course\r\nof the phyletic development of species and genera_, and the Lamarckian\r\nprinciple can have no part in their transformations. But if they follow\r\nthe most subtle changes, which we cannot precisely demonstrate, of the\r\nwhole wing-surface and in the mode of flight, as a man is followed by\r\nhis shadow, there must be some other principle which adapts the organ\r\nto its function, and which is able continually to adapt the large\r\nnumber of individual wing-veins in the manner most advantageous for the\r\ngeneral function. Here, therefore, we have a state of matters exactly\r\ncorresponding to that obtaining in the transformation of actively\r\nfunctioning parts which form a system with common co-operative action,\r\nas, for instance, in the case we first discussed, that of the stag's\r\nantlers.\r\n\r\nOther even more complicated examples of harmonious adaptation of\r\npassively functioning parts are afforded by the markings of animals,\r\nsuch as those of the butterfly's wing. The colours have only a passive\r\nrôle, whether they be due to pigments alone, or to structure, or to\r\nboth combined. When the coloration of a surface undergoes adaptive\r\nvariation, this cannot be due to any action of the colour, but must\r\ndepend on adaptation through selection. Yet it is well known that there\r\nare many butterfly-wings whose surfaces exhibit different colours and\r\ndifferent shades of colour on their different parts, and that in such\r\na way that together they form a picture, that of a leaf, a piece of\r\nbark, a stone overgrown with lichen, an eye, and so on. In such a case\r\nthe individual colour-spots stand in a particular, indirect relation\r\nto each other; although they are independent of each other in their\r\nvariation, they are not indifferent and due to chance, for together\r\nthey produce a common picture; this is harmonious adaptation of many\r\nparts, where the Lamarckian principle is absolutely excluded.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be objected that this mimetic picture does not\r\narise all at once, but very slowly in the course of long series of\r\ngenerations, and, indeed, of species. This must of course be so; the\r\nsimple beginnings are complicated and perfected through the course\r\nof long ages. This is implied in the principle of selection as we\r\nunderstand it. But does any one suppose that the gigantic antlers of\r\nthe giant-stag were developed in a few generations? In this case, too,\r\nmust not numerous races have succeeded each other before the primitive\r\nantlers attained this enormous size? If this must be assumed there was\r\nabundance of time for the adaptation, through _germinal_ variations, of\r\nthe secondarily varying parts, the muscles, tendons, nerves, and bones,\r\nfor all these parts function actively, and can without difficulty meet,\r\nin the individual life, the increased claims made upon them by a slight\r\nincrease in the size of the antlers. For the certain and indubitable\r\nconsequence of exercise, of increased use, is the strengthening of the\r\nfunctioning parts.\r\n\r\nThus the appropriate germinal variation of the secondarily varying\r\nparts may be delayed for a little without the individual being any\r\nthe less effective, or being obliged to succumb in the struggle for\r\nexistence. I do not, however, assert for a moment that the whole\r\nexplanation of the phenomena of co-adaptation is included in this;\r\non the contrary, I hope soon to be able to show that we may in such\r\ncases assume a preponderance of variational tendencies in a favourable\r\ndirection, and that there is thus an indirect connexion between\r\nthe utility of a variation and its actual occurrence. In the first\r\nplace, however, I must refer to the other group of facts which I have\r\nindicated, which show, likewise, that the simultaneous co-adaptation\r\nof different parts may arise in certain circumstances, although the\r\nLamarckian principle be excluded. These are the facts presented to us\r\nby the sterile forms of those insects, which, like bees, termites, and\r\nants, live together in large societies.\r\n\r\nAnts and bees are of special interest to us in this connexion, because\r\nthey have long been carefully watched by a number of distinguished\r\nnaturalists, and most of their vital functions have been precisely\r\nstudied. Ever since the days of 'Old Peter Huber' in Geneva there have\r\nagain and again been excellent observers who have devoted almost the\r\nwhole of their life-work and talents to the more complete study of\r\nthese wonderful animals. These insects are of interest to us here,\r\nbecause, in the course of the social life, a type of individual has\r\narisen which diverges in structure in many parts of the body from\r\nboth the male and the female, although it is sterile and does not\r\nreproduce, or does so in so few instances that the fact is of no moment\r\nin considering the origin of the present bodily structure. As is well\r\nknown, these neuters, or better, workers, are, among ants and bees,\r\nfemales which differ from the true females not only in their smaller\r\nsize and their infertility, but in many other points as well. Among\r\nants, for instance, they are absolutely wingless, and at the same time\r\nthey have a much smaller and differently formed thorax and a larger\r\nhead. But the most striking point is the difference in their instincts,\r\nfor while the females, concerned only with reproduction, pair and\r\nlay eggs, it is the workers who feed and clean the helpless emerging\r\nlarvæ, and put them in places of safety, who carry the pupæ into the\r\nwarm sunshine, and afterwards back again to the sheltered nest, who\r\nmake this nest itself, and keep it in order, after having collected or\r\nprepared the material for it; it is they alone who defend the colony\r\nagainst the attacks of enemies, who undertake predatory expeditions,\r\nattacking the nests of other ants, and engaging in obstinate combats\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nHow can all these peculiarities have arisen, since the workers do not\r\nreproduce, or do so only exceptionally, and, in any case, are incapable\r\nof pairing, and therefore--among bees at least--only produce male\r\noffspring? Obviously it cannot have been through the transmission of\r\nthe effects of use and disuse, since they leave no offspring to which\r\nanything could be transmitted.\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer has attempted to maintain the position that the\r\ncharacters of the workers of to-day already existed in the pre-social\r\nstate, that is, before the ants began to form colonies, and that,\r\ntherefore, they have not been newly evolved but only preserved. But,\r\neven if this be conceded in regard to the care of the brood and the\r\nbuilding instinct, so much remains that could not have existed at that\r\nstage, that the problem of the origin of these new characters remains\r\nunsolved. The wings, for instance, among ants, can only have been lost\r\nwhen females appeared which did not reproduce, for the pairing of ants\r\nis associated with a nuptial flight high in the air. The wings are not\r\nmerely absent in the workers, they do not even develop in the pupæ;\r\nthey are, as Dewitz showed, present even now in the larva in the form\r\nof imaginal disks, but from the pupa-stage onwards they degenerate, and\r\nthe segments of the thorax to which they are attached likewise appear\r\nsmall and modified. A variation of the germ-plasm must therefore have\r\ntaken place, and to this is due the fact that the wing-primordia no\r\nlonger develop, and that the thorax has a different development from\r\nwhat it had at the time when the animals were still fertile.\r\n\r\nIt has indeed been said that there is no need for assuming a variation\r\nof the germ-plasm, since the degeneration of the wing might be produced\r\nby inferior nourishment. This opinion is based on the fact that, among\r\nbees, the workers do actually arise from female larvæ which have\r\nreceived a meagre diet poor in nitrogenous elements, while the same\r\nfemale larvæ supplied with an abundant diet rich in nitrogen develop\r\ninto queens.\r\n\r\nBut even though we may assume that there is a similar difference in the\r\nmode of feeding among most ants, because the workers are considerably\r\nsmaller than the fertile females, it would be quite erroneous to\r\nconclude that the difference between the two types rests solely on the\r\neffect of differences in diet. The elimination of an individual organ\r\nhas never yet been determined by bad and scanty nourishment; it is the\r\nwhole animal with all its parts that degenerates and becomes small and\r\nweakly. Often as caterpillars of different species have been placed\r\non starvation diet, whether for experimental purposes or to procure\r\nvery small butterflies, it has never yet happened that a single organ,\r\nsuch as antenna, leg, or wing, has thereby been eliminated or caused\r\nto degenerate. I have myself instituted many such experiments with the\r\nmaggots of the blue-bottle fly, by supplying them from their earliest\r\nyouth with just as little food as possible without actually starving\r\nthem to death, yet never have these larvæ given rise to flies in which\r\nthe wings were absent or rudimentary.\r\n\r\nNor did these starved flies ever exhibit degenerate ovaries; they\r\nwere always completely developed and equipped with the full number\r\nof ovarian-tubes. It was to decide this particular point that\r\nthese experiments were instituted, for my opponents maintained\r\nthat degeneration of the ovaries was a direct result of inferior\r\nnourishment. But that is not the case. Special investigations in regard\r\nto ants, undertaken at my request by Miss Elizabeth Bickford, showed\r\nthat the anatomical results reached by earlier investigators, like\r\nAdlerz and Lespès, in regard to the degeneration of the ovaries in\r\nworkers, were absolutely correct, and that the 'degeneration' consists\r\nnot merely in the fact that the ovarian-tubes and ovum-primordia remain\r\nsmall, but also in a diminution of the _number_ of ovarian-tubes (Fig.\r\n105); the workers have always fewer ovarian-tubes than the females of\r\nthe same species, and--what is of especial importance--the reduction\r\nin the number of ovarian-tubes has been effected to a different extent\r\nin different species of ants. In the red wood-ant (_Formica rufa_) the\r\nworkers still possess from twelve to sixteen ovarian-tubes; in the\r\nmeadow-ant (_Formica pratensis_) only eight, six, or four; in _Lasius\r\nfuliginosus_ there are usually only two (one on either side); and in\r\nthe little turf-ant (_Tetramorium cæspitum_) there are none at all. We\r\nhave here, therefore, a phylogenetic process of degeneration, which\r\nhas reached different degrees in the different species, and has only\r\nbeen completed in one (_Tetramorium_). The case stands as I previously\r\nstated it: 'The elimination of a typical organ is not an ontogenetic\r\nprocess, but a phylogenetic one,' it depends not upon 'the mere\r\ninfluences of nutrition which affect the development of the individual,\r\nbut always on variations in the germ-plasm, which, to all appearance,\r\ncan only come about in the course of a long series of generations'[14].\r\n\r\n[14] _Aeussere Einflüsse als Entwickelungsreize_, Jena, 1894.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.

After Elizabeth Bickford.]\r\n\r\nAgainst this proposition an observation by O. vom Rath has been\r\ncited. According to it, three drone larvæ which had been accidentally\r\nfed by the workers with royal food exhibited striking retrogressive\r\npeculiarities in their sexual organs. The testes contained only\r\nimmature sperms (just before emergence from the pupa), and the\r\ncopulatory organ was entirely wanting. That a certain degree of fatty\r\ndegeneration of the testes should be caused by the 'unusual fattening'\r\nis not surprising, but it seems to me very questionable whether the\r\nabsence of the copulatory organ can be referred to the abnormal\r\ndiet; it ought to be definitely decided, by the investigation of\r\nnumerous cases, whether some abnormal peculiarity in the constitution\r\nof the germ-plasm in these eggs was not the true cause. Hitherto,\r\nunfortunately, I have not been able to procure the fresh material\r\nnecessary to decide this point[15]. From all this it must be evident\r\nthat we are not justified in regarding either the absence of wings or\r\nthe degeneration of the ovaries as a direct result of the inferior\r\nnourishment supplied to the workers in the larval state: but should\r\nany one still have doubt on this point I may mention that, among our\r\nindigenous ants, there are two species in which the workers are just as\r\nlarge as the fertile females, and that in tropical America a species\r\n(_Myrmecocystus megalocola_) occurs in which the workers are larger\r\nthan the true females; this must mean that they have received more food\r\nthan the females, though perhaps not the same mixture of food.\r\n\r\n[15] Since completing my manuscript I note that the point was settled\r\nthree years ago, when Koshewnikow had the opportunity of investigating\r\ndrone-pupæ which were abnormally reared in royal cells, and therefore\r\nfed with royal food. He found their sexual organs perfectly normal, and\r\nagrees with me that the abnormalities in Vom Rath's case must have been\r\ndue to some other cause. (See the report by Von Adelung on the Russian\r\npaper in _Zool. Centralblatt_, Sept. 10, 1901.)\r\n\r\nFrom all the facts we have discussed we can confidently conclude that\r\nthe differences in structure, which distinguish the workers from the\r\ntrue females, do not depend upon the influence, in the individual\r\nlifetime, of a poorer diet, but upon variation in the primary\r\nconstituents of the germ; we must conceive of the germ-plasm of ants as\r\ncontaining, in addition to male and female ids, special ids of workers,\r\nin which the determinants of wing and ovary are degenerate in some\r\ndegree, while the determinants of other parts, such as the brain, are\r\nmore highly developed. The manner of feeding, however, and perhaps the\r\nmingling with the food of a special secretion of the salivary glands,\r\nacts as a stimulus which determines whether one kind of id or another\r\nis to be liberated, that is, to become active and to enter on the path\r\nof development.\r\n\r\nA proof of this view is to be found, it seems to me, in the existence\r\nof transition forms between workers and true females, which was first\r\nbrought to general knowledge by Forel. Perhaps it would be better to\r\ncall these 'mongrel forms' for their various parts do not maintain a\r\nmedium between the two types, but many parts follow the type of the\r\nworker, and others that of the true female. Thus Forel twice found a\r\nnest of the red wood-ant which contained a large number of these mixed\r\nforms, all of which possessed the small head and large curved thorax of\r\nthe queen, but otherwise resembled the workers in size and appearance,\r\nand also in the degeneration of the ovaries. Many of them were very\r\nsmall, only 5 mm. in length, and had probably received very little\r\nfood, and, according to the theory of direct influence, these should\r\nhave been pure workers. That they possessed the head and thorax of a\r\nqueen is a proof that the characters of both forms of individual were\r\npresent in the germ-plasm as primary constituents, or indeed entire\r\nids. In normal circumstances only one kind of these ids would have\r\nbecome active, either the worker-id or the queen-id, but in abnormal\r\ncircumstances they might both be liberated to activity simultaneously,\r\nand then they would stamp one part of the body with the character of\r\na queen, another with that of a worker. Forel observed one of these\r\nnests in two successive years, and both times found the mixed forms\r\nin large numbers[16]. In the second year he found a great number of\r\nnewly-emerged individuals of this type. I have already inferred from\r\nthis observation that the mixed forms were probably in both years\r\nthe offspring of the same mother, and this may well have been the\r\ncase. My further conclusion, that the mixed forms must be due to some\r\nabnormality in the constitution of the germ-plasm of the maternal eggs,\r\nno longer appears to me so convincing as it did formerly, because, in\r\nthe interval, we have learnt, through that indefatigable investigator\r\nof ants, Pater Wasmann, that there is another possible explanation of\r\nthese mixed forms; it, too, is based upon a hypothesis, but it is so\r\ninteresting that I must briefly outline it to you.\r\n\r\n[16] There are different kinds of 'mixed forms' among ants, which may\r\nowe their origin to a variety of conditions, as Forel, Wasmann, and\r\nEmery have shown in detail.\r\n\r\nLike Forel and myself, Pater Wasmann had supposed that the reason of\r\nthis kind of mixed form (the so-called pseudogynous worker) lay in an\r\nabnormality of the constitution of the germ-plasm, but he now regards\r\nit as the result of a change in the mode of rearing instituted by the\r\nworkers with respect to the constitutionally female or queen larvæ,\r\nbecause there was a scarcity of workers. The hypothesis sounds very\r\ndaring, but it is well founded, at least in so far that there really\r\nis a reason why a scarcity of females must occur at certain times in\r\nsome colonies of ants, and this might certainly determine the workers\r\nin charge of the larvæ to feed females with worker food, so as to rear\r\nthem to render the necessary assistance.\r\n\r\nThis reason lies in the occasional presence of a parasitic beetle,\r\n_Lomechusa strumosa_, whose larvæ, curiously enough, are cared for and\r\nfed by the ants as though they were their own, and in return they eat\r\nup the larvæ of the ants, often destroying them in large numbers.\r\nWasmann informs us that the parasitic larvæ grow up just at the time at\r\nwhich the ants are rearing their workers, and it is these, therefore,\r\nwhich fall victims to the Lomechusa-larvæ, and the result is that a\r\nscarcity of young workers must soon make itself felt. The workers\r\nseek to make this good by rearing as workers all the larvæ previously\r\ndestined for queens. But this only succeeds partially, because the\r\ndevelopment towards true females has already begun; thus mixed forms\r\narise.\r\n\r\nThis explanation would be rather in the air if we did not know that,\r\namong bees, such changes in the manner of rearing are by no means\r\nuncommon. Indeed they occur regularly when the queen of a hive perishes\r\nand no more 'female' eggs are in store; young worker larvæ are then fed\r\nwith royal food, and these develop into queens. There can thus be no\r\ndoubt that these insects have it in their power to liberate to activity\r\neither the female ids or the worker ids by a specific mode of feeding,\r\nand there is nothing contrary to reason in admitting the possibility\r\nof an alternation of this influence in the course of development, for\r\nsomething analogous occurs in regard to secondary sexual characters,\r\nas, for instance, the appearance of male decorative colours in ducks\r\nthat have become sterile.\r\n\r\nBut this change in the mode of rearing bee-larvæ gives rise to pure\r\nqueens and not to mixed forms, and we must therefore regard it as\r\nundecided whether Wasmann's explanation is correct in this case, and\r\nwhether an abnormality in the constitution of the germ-plasm may not be\r\nthe true cause of this or other kinds of mixed forms among ants. In any\r\ncase the 'Lomechusa hypothesis' rests upon the assumption of different\r\nkinds of ids in the germ-plasm, as Pater Wasmann expressly states, and\r\nthe differences between the worker and queen-ants have their cause in\r\nthis, and not directly in the kind of larval food.\r\n\r\nIf there were not different ids corresponding to the different kinds\r\nof individuals in the germ-plasm a kind of polymorphism might indeed\r\nhave arisen in the colony through differences in nutrition, but it\r\ncould not have been of the kind we now see--that is, a sharply defined\r\ndifferentiation of persons, in adaptation to their different functions.\r\nThis presupposes elements in the germ which can vary slowly and\r\nconsistently in a definite direction without causing any change in the\r\nrest of the germ.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs gives to the phyletic evolution of the workers\r\na great theoretical significance, for it proves that positive as\r\nwell as negative variations of the most diverse parts of the body,\r\nthat simultaneous and correlative variations of many parts, can take\r\nplace in the course of the phylogeny, without the co-operation of\r\nthe Lamarckian factor. I have not hitherto laid any special emphasis\r\nupon the degree of differences occurring between workers and queens;\r\nbut I must now add that this may far exceed the degree that we are\r\nfamiliar with in our common indigenous ants, both in regard to\r\ninstinct and to bodily form. Even in the red Amazon ant of Western\r\nSwitzerland, _Polyergus rufescens_, we find quite a new instinct[17],\r\nthat of carrying off the pupæ of other species of ants, not to devour,\r\nbut to introduce them to their own nest and thus secure 'slaves.'\r\nFor these workers of a strange species, which emerge in a strange\r\nnest, naturally regard the place of their birth as their home, and\r\ndo there what instinct impels them, and what they would have done in\r\nthe nest of their parents: they feed the larvæ, fetch food, collect\r\nbuilding material, and so on. The domestic activity of the workers\r\nof the master-species thus becomes superfluous, and they have ceased\r\nto exercise it, and have now entirely lost the power of caring for\r\ntheir brood, searching for food, and keeping up the nest. They have\r\neven forgotten how to take food themselves, because they are always\r\nfed by the 'slaves.' Forel informs us--and I have myself repeated the\r\nexperiment--that _Polyergus_ workers, which are shut up with a drop\r\nof honey on the floor of their prison, will leave it, their favourite\r\nfood, untouched, and finally starve, unless one of their 'slaves' be\r\nshut up with them. As soon as this happens, and the slave perceives the\r\nhoney, it partakes of it, and then the 'mistress' comes and strokes the\r\n'slave' with her antennæ to signify her desires, whereupon the 'slave'\r\nproceeds to feed her from its own crop.\r\n\r\n[17] 'New' in this sense, that the instinct is not exhibited by most\r\nworker-ants, that it did not occur in the primaeval ancestors of modern\r\nants. It is, however, exhibited by a number of modern forms, and even\r\nby some German species.\r\n\r\nBut while the _Polyergus_ workers have forgotten their domestic habits,\r\nand have even ceased to be able to recognize their food, remarkable\r\nchanges have taken place in their jaws; these have lost the blunt teeth\r\non the inner margin, which, in other species, serve for masticating\r\nthe food, for seizing building material, and for other domestic\r\noccupations, and have become sharp weapons, bent in the form of a\r\nsabre, very well suited for piercing the head of an enemy, but also\r\nwell adapted for carrying off the pupæ, because they can seize them\r\nwithout doing them any injury.\r\n\r\nNo one will doubt that the predatory expeditions of the Amazon ants,\r\nand the slave-making habit, can only have developed after the habit\r\nof living in large companies had long existed, and this case proves\r\nthat variations of instinct, as well as of bodily structure, can\r\ntake place even after the workers have long been sterile. The case\r\nis the more instructive that it _seems_ as if it were due to the\r\ntransmission of a newly acquired and inherited habit of life, while\r\nin point of fact these Amazon-workers can transmit nothing, because\r\nthey bear no offspring. But if old instincts can be lost, and new ones\r\nacquired, when all possibility of inheritance is excluded, we see that\r\nNature has no need of the Lamarckian factor of modification for her\r\ntransformations and new adaptations.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to understand clearly that, in these changes, we have\r\nto do not merely with the alteration of a single part, but of many\r\nparts which all work together, we have only to think of the still\r\nmore striking physical modifications which have taken place in many\r\ntropical ants, and which have led to a dimorphism of the workers.\r\nIn many species, certainly, the only difference is in size, so that\r\none can distinguish between large workers and small, and the former\r\nare sometimes five times as big as the latter. But even in the South\r\nEuropean _Pheidole megalocephala_, which is abundant in Italy, the\r\nlarger workers are also different in structure from the smaller, for\r\nthey have an enormous head with powerful jaws. They are usually known\r\nas 'soldiers,' and are entrusted with the defence of the colony.\r\nEmery directly observed in regard to _Colobopsis truncata_, an ant\r\nwhich lives in the trunks of trees, that the soldiers, with their\r\nenormous heads, occupied all the entrances to the nest, ready to seize\r\nany intruder with their powerful jaws. In the Sauba ant (_Œcodoma\r\ncephalotes_) Bates described three different types of worker, differing\r\nin size, and although he was not able to determine with certainty what\r\nthe particular function of each was, there can be no doubt that they\r\nhave special offices, and that the differences in their structure are\r\nadaptations to the differences in their functions. The same is true of\r\nthe Indian ant, _Pheidologeton diversus_, depicted in Fig. 106, whose\r\nthree forms of workers I owe to the kindness of Professor August Forel.\r\n\r\nIf the increase in the size of the head and jaws must bring with it an\r\nincrease in the thickness of the skeleton of these parts, as well as\r\na strengthening of the musculature of the head, it follows that the\r\nstrain on the body must be greater, just as in the case of the increase\r\nin the weight of the stag's antlers, so that the skeleton of the\r\nthorax must likewise have become thicker and heavier, the muscles and\r\nnerves of the legs stronger, the articulations of the joints capable\r\nof greater resistance; in short, a whole series of variations of other\r\nparts must have taken place simultaneously, if the primary variation\r\nwas to be of use, and not to lead to the destruction of its possessor.\r\nHere again we have a proof that the co-adaptation of many parts can\r\ntake place without any intervention of the Lamarckian principle, and\r\nthat there must be some other factor which brings this about.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106. Three workers of the same species of Indian\r\nAnt (_Pheidologeton diversus_), drawn from specimens supplied by\r\nProf. August Forel. _A_, the largest, _B_, the intermediate, _C_, the\r\nsmallest form.]\r\n\r\nWhere, then, shall we look for this other factor, if not in the\r\nprocesses of selection, in the selecting of the most suitable\r\nvariations among all those which occur? We are confronted with the\r\nalternative of either working out a sufficient explanation with this\r\nfactor, or of giving up the attempt at explanation altogether. Yet the\r\napplication of the principle of selection in relation to the neuters\r\nof colony-forming insects is by no means simple, for, as the workers\r\nare sterile, a modification of them through processes of breeding\r\ncannot begin directly with themselves. The workers which exhibit the\r\nmost suitable variations cannot be selected for breeding, but only\r\ntheir parents, the sexual animals, and these according to whether\r\nthey produce better workers or worse. This is how Darwin looked at\r\nthe matter, and his view receives support from one peculiarity in\r\nthe composition of these animal colonies, whose significance becomes\r\napparent in relation to this problem. It has long been known that\r\nin a bee-hive there are from 10,000 to 20,000 workers, but only one\r\ntrue female, the so-called queen, and the meaning of this remarkable\r\narrangement probably is, that the adaptation of the workers through\r\nnatural selection becomes much more easily possible, _since the whole\r\nnumber are the children of a single pair_. It is not the individual\r\nworkers, but the whole colony, that is, the whole progeny of the\r\nqueen, which is selected, according to the greater or less degree of\r\neffectiveness displayed by the workers. Strictly speaking, it is the\r\nsingle queen that is selected in relation to her power of producing\r\nsuperior or inferior workers. A colony whose queen was unsatisfactory\r\nin this respect could not hold its own in the struggle for existence,\r\nand only the best colonies and the best hives would survive, that\r\nis, through their descendants. If the hive contained a hundred\r\nqueens instead of a single queen the process of selection would be\r\nmuch more complex and less clear, and it is even quite conceivable\r\nthat the production of specially modified workers, adapted to their\r\nfunctions, or of two or three different kinds of workers, would not\r\nhave been possible at all. For it would not have helped much if one\r\nout of a hundred females had produced workers of better structure;\r\nonly a majority of such females could give the colony any advantage as\r\ncompared with other colonies.\r\n\r\nIt has not been definitely established whether, among ants, a single\r\nfemale is in all cases the founder of the whole colony, but it is\r\ncertain that there are only a few females. In the tropical Termites we\r\nknow that the ovaries of the female attain to such a colossal size that\r\none female must certainly suffice for the necessities of the largest\r\ncolonies. Grassi has shown, indeed, that, as far as the South European\r\nTermites are concerned, not only are there several females present,\r\nbut that even the workers frequently reproduce; but the Termites in\r\ngeneral are inhabitants of warm countries, and the few European species\r\nprobably hardly represent the original composition of these animal\r\ncolonies. But of the tropical species, which have as yet not been\r\nsufficiently studied, we know at least the extraordinary dimensions\r\nof the body, and the corresponding fertility of the queens, and we\r\nconclude from this that only a few can be present in each termitary[18].\r\n\r\n[18] Ingwe Sjostedt has recently established in Africa that it is\r\nusually a single queen and a single king that found a termitary\r\n(_Schwed. Akad. Abh._ Bd. 34, 1902).\r\n\r\nNow that we have discussed all these facts it will not be out of place\r\nto summarize the results, in as far as they have any relation to the\r\nacceptance or rejection of the theory of the inheritance of acquired\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nNo _direct_ proof of such transmission could be found; on the contrary,\r\nit has been shown that all that has hitherto been advanced as such will\r\nnot stand the test of close examination; an inheritance of wounds and\r\nmutilations does not exist, the transmission of traumatically induced\r\nepilepsy is not only doubtful as regards its causes, but cannot even\r\nbe considered as the transmission of a particular morphological lesion.\r\n\r\nWe may regard as _indirect_ proofs such facts as can only be explained\r\non the assumption of this mode of inheritance, and in this connexion\r\nour opponents have cited especially the correspondence between\r\nmodifications acquired through use in the individual lifetime,\r\nand worked out through histonal selection, with the phyletic\r\ntransformations of the same parts. But it has been shown that a number\r\nof parts which do not function actively at all, but only passively, and\r\nthus cannot be caused to change through use, like the hard skeletal\r\nparts of the Arthropods, vary phyletically in the same certain and\r\ndirect course as those which function actively, so that we have every\r\nground for assuming that there are other factors operating in the\r\ntransformation of the active as well as of the passive parts. Finally,\r\nwe discussed the last and strongest argument which has been put forward\r\nin favour of the Lamarckian principle, that of co-adaptation, that is,\r\nthe simultaneous adaptation of many parts co-operating in a common\r\naction, and we were able to controvert this altogether by showing\r\nthat exactly similar phenomena of co-adaptation occur in systems\r\nof passively functioning parts, and further, that they occur also\r\namong the workers of ants and bees, that is, in animals which do not\r\nreproduce, and which, therefore, cannot transmit the acquired results\r\nof exercise during their life.\r\n\r\nWe therefore reject--and are compelled to reject--the Lamarckian\r\nprinciple, not only on the ground that it cannot be proved correct, but\r\nalso because the phenomena, to explain which it is used, occur also\r\nunder circumstances which absolutely exclude any possibility of the\r\nco-operation of this principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Supplementary note on the Transmissibility of Acquired Functional\r\nModifications._\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this section without some reference to the utterances\r\nof some naturalists who have quite recently attempted to represent the\r\ninheritance of functional modifications as a conceivable and even a\r\nnecessary assumption.\r\n\r\nI may name first Ludwig Zehnder, a physicist who has wandered into the\r\ndomain of biology. In regard to the very facts which I have adduced\r\nas evidence _against_ the existence of such inheritance, he has\r\nendeavoured to show how we might conceive of them as having by this\r\nvery means arisen[19].\r\n\r\n[19] Zehnder, _Die Entstehung des Lebens_, Freiburg-i.-Br., 1899.\r\n\r\nHe deals with the case of ants, that is to say, with the\r\ndifferentiation of the sterile workers into several castes, in the\r\nfollowing interesting manner.\r\n\r\nThe task of the workers is to procure all the food necessary for all\r\nthe individuals of the colony in quantity and quality corresponding\r\nto the demand; failing this the whole colony would perish. Now the\r\ndifferent persons of the colony need different food, according to their\r\nconstitution and their functions. Soldiers, for instance, are more\r\npowerful than ordinary workers, since they are adapted for fighting,\r\nand they therefore require a different kind of food from the weaker\r\nworkers who are adapted only for other duties. Since the soldiers have\r\nevolved from the latter by selection, what we may, for the sake of\r\nbrevity, call the soldier-food in the common stores of the ants would\r\nbe drawn upon more lavishly than before, and would therefore disappear\r\nmore quickly, and, whenever this occurred, those workers which had\r\nalready brought in this kind of food would be impelled to bring more\r\nand more to satisfy the demand for it. But in order to do this they\r\nwould require to exert themselves more, and would therefore require a\r\nlarger quantity of food--not of course soldier-food, but the particular\r\nkind which their particular qualities demanded. Probably this second\r\nimportation of food was undertaken by a second kind of worker, for,\r\naccording to Zehnder, each worker does not carry all the kinds of food;\r\nthey are divided into legions, each of which has its particular task of\r\nfood-collecting to fulfil.\r\n\r\nIn the end the storehouse of the ant-colony must contain a provision\r\nin which the different kinds of food are in exact proportion to the\r\nnecessities of the different kinds of persons in the colony. It must\r\nalter in its composition again as soon as, in the course of time, one\r\nor other kind of person acquires new characters, for these presuppose a\r\nnew kind of diet.\r\n\r\nBut how are these acquired characters to be transmitted since neither\r\nsoldiers nor workers reproduce? Zehnder answers this by pointing out\r\nthat the sexual animals eat _all_ the kinds of nourishment which are\r\naccumulated in the stores, that is to say, all the different kinds of\r\nfood exactly in the proportion in which they have been imported--the\r\nproportion in which the different kinds of persons are represented in\r\nthe colony. Thus the kinds of nourishment which caused the appearance\r\nof the newly acquired characters in the non-sexual animals also\r\nreached the sexual animals and their sex-cells, and there gave rise to\r\nsubstances which evoke the relevant qualities in their descendants, for\r\ninstance, in the soldiers, or in the still more modified workers, and\r\nso on; and thus we have an 'inheritance of acquired characters.'\r\n\r\nThis is certainly ingeniously and cleverly thought out, and it reads\r\neven better and more smoothly in the original than in my brief summary,\r\nbut it will hardly be regarded as a refutation of my position; the\r\nhypotheses are all too daring for that. We have no knowledge that\r\nparticular modifications in form can be produced and conditioned by\r\nparticular kinds of food, and, indeed, the contrary has been proved,\r\nnamely, that the two or three different castes of polymorphic species\r\nhave precisely similar diet. I need only recall the six forms of female\r\nin _Papilio merope_, of which at least three have been obtained from\r\nthe same set of eggs, and by feeding with the same plant.\r\n\r\nIt is true that there are ants which lay in stores of nourishment,\r\nbut these consist, for the most part, of one kind of seeds, or of\r\nhoney, not of different substances, and we have no knowledge that\r\nthe different persons use different food, or even that there is any\r\ndiversity in the mode of feeding the helpless larvæ. The feeding in\r\nsome species takes place from mouth to mouth, and therefore cannot be\r\nprecisely investigated, and we can only suppose from analogy with bees\r\nthat the larvæ of the males and females frequently receive not only\r\nmore abundant, but qualitatively different food. They are fed from the\r\ncrop unless the food consists of the pith of a tree in which the larvæ\r\nare imbedded, as Dahl informs us is the case with some tropical ants of\r\nthe Bismarck Archipelago.\r\n\r\nBut even if we assume that the soldiers take different food from the\r\nordinary workers, and different again from that of the sexual animals,\r\nis it by virtue of the quality of their food that they have become\r\nwhat they are? Have our breeds of pigeons or hens been produced by\r\ndifferent diet, or do we know anything in the whole range of animal\r\nlife of such a parallelism between food and bodily structure as Zehnder\r\nhere assumes? And if, in reality, let us say, the breeds of pigeon had\r\narisen through specific dieting, and we were to feed one pair with the\r\nspecific food-stuffs of three different breeds, would the descendants\r\nof this pair exhibit the form of these three breeds? Or would they\r\nexhibit them in precisely the proportion in which the food-stuffs had\r\nbeen mixed? It seems to me that Zehnder's assumptions diverge so far\r\nfrom what we are accustomed to regard as solid ground in biology that\r\nthey hardly require consideration, and yet he not only uses them for\r\nthe explanation of the case of the ants, but bases upon them the whole\r\nof his theory of the inheritance of acquired characters.\r\n\r\nHe considers that the results of use (that is, increased function)\r\nare generally transmitted, because the increase in the organ which\r\nis functioning more strongly changes the composition of the blood,\r\nby withdrawing from it in a greater degree the specific substances\r\nwhich the organ in question--a muscle, for instance--requires for its\r\nactivity. All parts of the animal are thereby affected and modified,\r\nbut especially those smallest vital units or 'fistellæ' (corresponding\r\nto biophors) which preside over digestion, and of which there are\r\nseveral sorts. Among them those work most arduously which have to\r\nproduce the specific substances which serve for the nutrition of the\r\nmuscles with increased function, because these are needed in larger\r\nquantities. This kind of digestive 'fistella' therefore multiplies,\r\nwhile other kinds, whose products are not required and therefore not\r\nused up, cease to be so active, diminish in number, and in course of\r\ntime disappear. In this way the composition of the blood is altered,\r\nand with it to a greater or less degree all the characters of the whole\r\norganism. Of course the reproductive cells are also under the influence\r\nof this change in the composition of the blood, because the different\r\nnutritive substances are accumulated within them in an altered\r\nproportion corresponding to the changed composition of the blood, the\r\nnutritive substances for the muscles with increased function being\r\ncontained in it in a larger quantity, and thus the greater development\r\nof the muscle will repeat itself in the progeny, that is to say, _the\r\nacquired character is transmitted_.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that this is precisely the same line of argument as that\r\nused in reference to the origin of the worker and soldier ants. The\r\ndifferent kinds of 'digestive fistellæ' correspond to the different\r\nfood-carrying workers, and the blood to the assumed storehouse\r\nfrom which soldiers and workers select the food suitable for their\r\nrespective needs, while the sex-cells in the one case, the sexual\r\nanimals in the other, partake of all kinds exactly in the proportion\r\nin which they are stored, and thus the organ which functions most\r\nvigorously must be stronger in the offspring.\r\n\r\nHow the minute quantity of nutritive material contained in the ovum,\r\nstill less in the sperm, is to effect the strengthening of the\r\nparticular muscles in the descendants is not stated; moreover, such\r\nminimal quantities of food must soon be exhausted, and cannot possibly\r\nincrease. It would seem as if the muscles could not even begin by\r\nbeing stronger, much less that they should remain so, if they were\r\nnot exercised equally vigorously by the descendants. If the specific\r\nnutritive stuffs were 'fistellæ,' that is to say, were living units\r\ncapable of multiplication, one could understand it. But there can,\r\nof course, be no possibility of a production of living units through\r\ndigestion; that can only give rise to digested substances. Or if the\r\nalteration in the composition of the blood produced in the determinant\r\nsystem of the germ-plasm just those variations requisite to bring\r\nabout a strengthening of the muscular system, it would remain to be\r\nshown how this could happen, for the gist of the problem lies in this.\r\nFor muscles do not lie in the germ-plasm as miniature models of the\r\nsubsequent muscular system, and even if they did, would not all the\r\nmuscles, and not merely those which were no longer exercised, decrease\r\nhereditarily when a particular group, like the muscles of the ear in\r\nman, degenerates? Zehnder replies to this with the hypothesis that\r\nthe muscles are not all chemically alike, but that each possesses a\r\nparticular chemical formula, though they may all be very similar, and\r\nthat, therefore, the nutritive materials required by each must be\r\nslightly different. In that case there would require to be, in the\r\novum and sperm of man, in order that functional modifications might be\r\ntransmitted, as many special nutritive substances as there are muscles,\r\nand, in addition to these, innumerable hosts of other kinds of specific\r\nnutritive substances for all the other parts of the body, since all of\r\nthem can be strengthened by exercise and weakened by disuse. And even\r\nif we suppose that all these millions of specific nutritive substances\r\nare accommodated within the germ-cells, as Zehnder's theory requires,\r\nthey could not perform what Zehnder ascribes to them, for, as we have\r\nalready said, they cannot multiply in the manner of living units, and\r\nso control the growing organism. The different specific nutritive\r\nmaterials contained in the blood are just as powerless to perform the\r\ntask ascribed to them by Zehnder as the specific kinds of food in the\r\nhypothetical storehouse of the ants are to give rise to the different\r\npersons of the ant-colony.\r\n\r\nZehnder also attempts to overthrow the arguments against the Lamarckian\r\nprinciple which I based on the skeleton of Arthropods.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem to him probable that the chitinous coat of mail can\r\nbe an absolutely dead structure, and he supposes that very delicate\r\nnerve-fibrils penetrate into all its most minute parts, and so are\r\nstimulated by 'every pressure and every strain' exerted on the\r\nchitinous skeleton. They 'work' when they are stimulated, and in\r\ndoing so they use up 'their specific food-stuffs.' At places which\r\nare frequently stimulated the corresponding nerves develop more than\r\nelsewhere. The necessary specific food-stuffs for these particular\r\nnerves therefore increase proportionately within the body, and also\r\nin the reproductive cells. Accordingly, in the germ-cells there is an\r\nincrease of the aforesaid nervous substances, which in the offspring\r\nbecome associated with the relevant part of the chitinous covering, and\r\ninduce in development the secretion of chitin at this part. At this\r\nparticular spot, then, the chitin will be specially thick.\r\n\r\nThis clearly implies that each particular part of the skin has its\r\nspecific nutritive substances, necessitated by the nerves which\r\ntraverse it! Thus there must be as many nerve-nutritive substances\r\nas there are skin-nerves, specific chemical combinations for every\r\npart of the body which is capable of heritable variation. This is so\r\nextraordinarily improbable that I need say nothing more about it. If\r\nthe Lamarckian principle requires this kind of hypothesis to bolster it\r\nup, it is undoubtedly doomed.\r\n\r\nIf we disregard altogether the positive aspect of Zehnder's hypothesis,\r\nand assume that the skin-nerves are really stimulated through the\r\nchitin by every strain and pressure to which a spot of skin is exposed,\r\nand that they cause a correspondingly greater secretion of chitin,\r\nwhich would then, according to the Lamarckian principle, be hereditary,\r\ndoes this harmonize with what actually occurs in the development of\r\nthe skeleton as we know it in the case of Insects and Crustaceans? Not\r\nat all! Can we suppose that the carapace of a crab or the enormously\r\nhard wing-covers of a water-beetle are exposed to a continual pounding\r\nand pressing and pushing? Exactly the contrary is the case. Every\r\nassailant takes care not to grasp the animal where it is so well\r\nprotected, and seeks out the most vulnerable parts for its attacks. It\r\nmay be answered that, while this is certainly the case now, the animals\r\nwere badly protected when the ancestral forms were evolving. But that\r\nthey could not have become hard by dint of being frequently bitten or\r\notherwise wounded should be obvious from the fact that the whole of the\r\nwing-covers and the whole of the carapace is uniformly covered with\r\nthick chitin, while each wound would only stimulate particular spots;\r\nand we should also have to admit that, since these parts of the skin\r\nwhich are now so well protected are no longer seized and stimulated,\r\nthey would long ago have become thin again, according to the principle\r\nof the degeneration of parts no longer used, or, in this case, no\r\nlonger stimulated. But there is no need for wasting time over such\r\nquibbles, since there is a fact which absolutely contradicts Zehnder's\r\nhypothesis. I mean the degeneration of the chitinous skeleton in those\r\nCrustaceans and Insects which protect the abdomen within a shelter\r\nlike the hermit-crabs, the caddis-flies (Phryganidæ), (Fig. 107) and\r\nthe sack-carrying caterpillars of the Psychidæ among Lepidoptera. The\r\nhermit-crabs, as is well known, squeeze their abdomen into a usually\r\nspirally-coiled Gasteropod shell, and they always choose houses which\r\nare wide enough to conceal the whole body up to the hard claws when\r\nnecessity arises. In this case there is surely a continual pressure on\r\nthe abdomen, which, being soft, must be squeezed very tightly every\r\ntime the animal retreats into its shell. One of my opponents has\r\ndescribed the disappearance of the tough integumentary skeleton from\r\nthe abdomen of these animals as an inherited result of this pressure,\r\nand another regards it as the inherited result of the degeneration\r\nof the muscles in this part of the body. But, according to Zehnder,\r\nthis continuous pressure, and the frequent rubbing up and down of\r\nthe abdomen on the inner surface of the Gasteropod's shell, would\r\nundoubtedly have a stimulating effect on the skin-nerves, and would\r\ntherefore bring about a thickening of the chitinous cuticle. In regard\r\nto the larval Phryganidæ and Psychidæ, the case would be the same,\r\nthough perhaps hardly to the same degree, for while these larvæ make\r\ntheir own houses, and will therefore at least make them big enough to\r\nbegin with, the pressure and friction must increase with the growth of\r\nthe animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107. Larva of a Caddis-fly, after Rösel. _A_,\r\nremoved from its case, showing the hooks (_h_) which attach it thereto,\r\nand the whitish abdomen, covered only by a thin cuticle. _B_, the same\r\nlarva, moving about with its case.]\r\n\r\nIf the regulation of the strength of the integumentary skeleton be\r\nreferred to selection, we see at once why carapace and wing-covers\r\nshould be of equal thickness throughout their whole extent, and why\r\nthey do not disappear, although they do not function actively, and\r\nare less stimulated than any other parts of the skeleton; and we also\r\nunderstand why the abdomen of hermit-crabs and of larval Phryganidæ\r\nand Psychidæ has become soft, whether it be exposed to pressure or\r\nfriction in a greater or a less degree. It no longer requires to be\r\nhard, because it is protected by the house, and in the case of the\r\nPagurids it must not be hard because it could not then be readily\r\nsqueezed into the hard-walled and narrow recesses of the Gasteropod\r\nshell; in this case there has therefore been positive selection. I have\r\nnot yet referred to the fact that the chitinous covering is certainly\r\nnot living, though it is not exactly dead; it is a secretion of the\r\nepidermic cells, not a tissue, and we cannot suppose that there are\r\nany nerve-endings in it. It is almost superfluous to say that the fact\r\nthat the skin is cast is in itself enough to make such an assumption\r\nuntenable, for the whole of the assumed delicate nervous network would\r\nbe shed at every moult and torn away from the nerves which lead to it.\r\nAs far as my knowledge goes, nothing of this kind occurs anywhere in\r\nthe whole range of the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nEven if we assume, for the benefit of Zehnder's hypothesis, that\r\nalthough there are no nerves in the chitin itself yet irritations\r\naffecting the chitinous coat may be transmitted through it to the\r\ndelicate nerve-endings lying beneath it, this should take place in a\r\ngreater degree at the thin places of the skeleton than _at the thick\r\nparts_! But this interpretation is again fallacious, for we see that\r\nthe tactile organs of Arthropods always break through the chitinous\r\ncuticle and protrude beyond it in the form of setæ.\r\n\r\nOf the many other opponents of my views in regard to the\r\ntransmissibility of acquired functional modifications, I need only deal\r\nin detail with Oscar Hertwig.\r\n\r\nHe seeks for direct proofs of an inheritance of acquired characters,\r\nand believes that he has found these in the hereditary transmission of\r\nacquired immunity from certain diseases. He reminds us of Ehrlich's\r\nwell-known experiments on mice with ricin and abrin.\r\n\r\nEven small doses of these two poisons kill mice, but they are tolerated\r\nin very minute doses, and if their administration be continued for some\r\ntime in such minute doses, the animals gradually acquire a high degree\r\nof insensitiveness to these poisons; they become immune to ricin and\r\nabrin.\r\n\r\nThis immunity is transmitted from mother to young, but it only lasts\r\nfor a short time, about six to eight weeks after birth. Yet this is\r\nregarded by Hertwig as an illustration of the transmission of an\r\nacquired character, as an acquired modification of the cells of the\r\nbody, for he explains the immunity on the assumption that all the cells\r\nof the body undergo a particular variation due to the influence of the\r\npoison, and are thus, to a certain extent, modified in their nature,\r\nand that the ovum also undergoes this variation and transmits it to the\r\nyoung animal. The immunization might certainly come under the category\r\nof functional modifications, and it might be thought that we have here\r\na case of transmission of such an acquired character.\r\n\r\nAgainst this, however, we have to put the fact that _the acquired\r\nimmunity is not transmitted from the father to the descendants_.\r\nHertwig attempts to explain this by saying that the short duration\r\nof the experiments has only allowed the poison to affect the\r\ncell-substance (cytoplasm) and not the nucleus, that is, the hereditary\r\nsubstance of the sperm-cells, an assumption which has little\r\nprobability considering the intimate nutritive relations between the\r\ncell-nucleus and the cytoplasm. I should be rather inclined to conclude\r\nfrom the difference in the transmitting power of the sperm and of the\r\novum, that this 'inheritance of immunity' does not depend, as Hertwig\r\nsupposes, on a modification of the cells to 'ricin immunity,' but, as\r\nEhrlich and the bacteriologists believe, on the production of so-called\r\n'anti-toxins,' and that these anti-toxins are handed on to the embryo\r\nnot by the ovum itself, but by the interchange of blood between mother\r\nand offspring which lasts throughout the whole embryonic period. It is\r\nthen self-evident why no transmission of immunity through the father\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\nBut it would lead me too far were I to attempt to refute all the\r\nattempts that have been made to interpret individual cases as due to\r\nthe inheritance of acquired characters. I should, however, like to say\r\nsomething as to the theoretical possibility of such an assumption.\r\n\r\nWhen we try to conceive how experiences and their consequences can\r\nbe entailed, how new acquirements of the 'personal part can have\r\nrepresentative effects on the germinal part,' we find ourselves\r\nconfronted with almost, if not entirely, insuperable difficulties.\r\nHow could it happen that the constant exercise of memory throughout\r\na lifetime, as, for instance, in the case of an actor, could\r\ninfluence the germ-cells in such a way that in the offspring the same\r\nbrain-cells which preside over memory will likewise be more highly\r\ndeveloped--that is, capable of greater functional activity? We know\r\nwhat Zehnder's answer to such a question would be; he would make the\r\nblood the intermediary between the brain-cells and the germ-cells, but\r\nwe have seen that specific food-stuffs for each specific cell-group\r\ncannot be assumed, and that, even if they could, they would not meet\r\nthe necessities of the case. Yet every one who does not regard the\r\ngerm-plasm as composed of determinants is constrained to make some such\r\nassumption. But if we take our stand upon the theory of determinants,\r\nit would be necessary to a transmission of acquired strength of\r\nmemory that the states of these brain-cells should be communicated by\r\nthe telegraphic path of the nerve-cells to the germ-cells, and should\r\nthere modify only the determinants of the brain-cells, and should do\r\nso in such a way that, in the subsequent development of an embryo\r\nfrom the germ-cell, the corresponding brain-cells should turn out to\r\nbe capable of increased functional activity. But as the determinants\r\nare not miniature brain-cells, but only groups of biophors of unknown\r\nconstitution, and are assuredly different from those cells; as they\r\nare not 'seed-grains' of the brain-cells, but only living germ-units\r\nwhich, in co-operation with the rest exercise a decisive influence on\r\nthe memory-cells of the brain, I can only compare the assumption of the\r\ntransmission of the results of memory-exercise to the telegraphing of a\r\npoem, which is handed in in German, but at the place of arrival appears\r\non the paper translated into Chinese.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as I have said before, I do not disagree with those who\r\nsay, with Oscar Hertwig, that the impossibility of forming a conception\r\nof the physiological nexus involved in the assumed transmission does\r\nnot _ipso facto_ constrain us to conclude that the transmission\r\ndoes not occur. I cannot, however, agree with Hertwig that the case\r\nis exactly the same as in the 'converse process,' that is, 'in the\r\ndevelopment of the given invisible primary constituents in the\r\ninheritance of the cell into the visible characters of the personal\r\npart.' Certainly no one can state with any definiteness how the germ\r\ngoes to work, so that from it there arises an eye or a brain with its\r\nmillionfold intricacies of nerve-paths, but although the process cannot\r\nbe understood in detail, it can in principle, and this is just what is\r\nimpossible in regard to the communication of functional modifications\r\nto the germ. Moreover, in addition to this, there is the very important\r\ndifference that, in the one case, we know with certainty that the\r\nprocess actually takes place, although we cannot understand its\r\nmechanical sequence in detail, while in the other we cannot even prove\r\nthat the supposed process is a real one at all. From the fact that we\r\nare unable to form clear conceptions of a hypothetical process, we are\r\nnot justified, it seems to me, in assuming it to be real, even though\r\nwe are aware of many other processes in nature which we are unable to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nNor does Hertwig take up this position, for he is at pains to show\r\nthe mechanical possibility of the process of inheritance which he\r\nassumes, and he bases this upon the suggestions made by Hering in his\r\nfamous work _Ueber das Gedächtniss als eine allgemeine Function der\r\norganisirten Materie_ [_On memory as a general function of organized\r\nmatter_], 1870. As this essay probably contains the best that can be\r\nsaid in favour of a transmission of functional modifications, and as\r\nit also includes some indisputable truths, we may consider it in some\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nHering is undoubtedly right in regarding 'the phenomena of\r\nconsciousness as functions of the material changes of organic\r\nsubstance, and conversely.' That is, he believes that every sensation,\r\nevery perception, every act of will arises from material changes in\r\nthe relevant nerve-substances. But we know that 'whole groups of\r\nimpressions, which our brain has received through the sense-organs, are\r\nstored up in it, as if resting, and below the margin of consciousness,\r\nto be reproduced when occasion arises, in correct order of space and\r\ntime, and with such vividness, that we may be deceived into regarding\r\nas a present reality what has long ceased to be present.' There\r\nmust therefore remain in the nerve-substance a 'material impact,' a\r\nmodification of the molecular or atomic structure, which enables it 'to\r\nring out to-day the note that it gave forth yesterday if only it be\r\nrightly struck.'\r\n\r\nHering attributes a similar power of memory and reproduction to\r\nthe germ-substance; he believes that he is justified in making the\r\nassumption that acquired characters can be inherited, although he\r\nadmits that it 'appears to him puzzling in the highest degree'\r\nhow characters which developed in the most diverse organs of the\r\nmother-being can exert any influence on the germ. That he may be able\r\nto assume this he points to the interconnexion of all organs by means\r\nof the nervous system; it is this that makes it possible that 'the\r\nfate of one reverberates in the other, and that, when excitement takes\r\nplace at any point, some echo of it, however dull, penetrates to the\r\nremotest parts.' To the delicate-winged communication by means of the\r\nnervous system, which unites all parts among themselves, must be added\r\nthe general communication by means of the circulation of the fluids of\r\nthe body. According to Hering's view, the germ experiences, in some\r\ndegree, in itself all that befalls the rest of the organs and parts\r\nof the organism, and these experiences stamp themselves more or less\r\nupon its substance, just as sense-impressions or perceptions stamp\r\nthemselves upon the nerve-substance of the brain, and these experiences\r\nare reproduced during the development of the germ, just as the brain\r\nbrings memory-pictures back to consciousness. He says, 'If something in\r\nthe mother-organism has so changed its nature, through long habit or\r\nexercise repeated a thousand times, that the germ-cell resting in it is\r\nalso penetrated by it in however weakened a fashion, when the latter\r\nbegins a new existence, expands, and increases to a new being whose\r\nindividual parts are still itself and flesh of its flesh, it reproduces\r\nwhat it experienced as part of a great whole. This is just as wonderful\r\nas when an old man suddenly remembers his earliest childhood, but it is\r\nnot more wonderful than this.'\r\n\r\nBut I think it is more wonderful. There exist demonstrably in the\r\nbrain thousands upon thousands of nerve-elements, whose activity\r\nis a definite and limited one, because each particular visual\r\nimpression, for instance, only excites to activity certain definite\r\nnerve-elements, and can leave memory-pictures in these alone. According\r\nto my conception of it, the germ-plasm is quite as complex in its\r\ncomposition, and does not consist of homogeneous elements, but of\r\ninnumerable different kinds, which are not related to the parts of the\r\ncomplete organism indiscriminately, but only to particular parts. But\r\nis it allowable to assume that there are invisible nerve-connexions,\r\nnot only to every germ-cell, but also within the germ-plasm, to\r\nevery determinant, like the nerve-paths which lead from the eye\r\nto the nerve-cells in the optic-area of the brain? For if it were\r\notherwise, how could we conceive of the modification of an organ--as,\r\nfor instance, the ear-muscles in Man--communicating itself to the\r\nprecise determinants of these muscles in the germ-plasm? I have often\r\nbeen met with the reproach that my conception of the composition of\r\nthe germ-plasm is much too complex--but the complexity of Hering's\r\nsuggestion seems to me to go a long way beyond mine.\r\n\r\nHering's ideas, which are not only ingenious but very stimulating,\r\nmight be accepted as the first indication of an understanding of the\r\nassumed inheritance of functional modifications, if it could be proved\r\nthat such inheritance is a fact; but, as we have seen, that is not\r\nthe case. The assumption might be permitted, perhaps, if it could be\r\nshown that certain groups of phenomena left no other possibility of\r\nexplanation open except this assumption, but that also, as far as I\r\ncan see, is not the case. Of course, others hold a different opinion,\r\nbut chiefly because they have rejected without much reflection the\r\nsole explanation which presents itself for numerous phenomena--I\r\nmean the processes which we are about to study under the name of\r\n'germinal selection.' But, in any case, Hering's ideas seem to me very\r\nvaluable, because they make it apparent that, however much we know of\r\nthe organism, we only know it in a general way, and that numberless\r\ndelicate processes go on in it which leave no trace for our microscope,\r\nand that we can only recognize the final results of numerous invisible\r\nand often, in their subtlety, also unimaginable factors. This ought to\r\nbe taken to heart, especially by all those who speak of simplicity in\r\nreference to the germ-plasm. So much at least is certain: If there were\r\nany inheritance of functional modifications, we should have another\r\nproof that the germ-plasm is composed of determinants, for without them\r\nthere could be no possibility that the 'experiences' of an individual\r\norgan would be transmitted to the germ in the way that the Lamarckian\r\nprinciple implies. Something, and that something material, must be\r\nmodified in the germ-plasm if the vigorous use of a group of muscles,\r\nor of a gland, or of a nerve-cell, is to be communicated to the germ,\r\nand not to the whole germ-plasm, but only to so much of it as is\r\nnecessary to cause variation in the corresponding group of cells in the\r\nchild. It may perhaps be said that this still does not necessitate the\r\nassumption of special determinants for these cell-groups, and that one\r\nmight, with Herbert Spencer, conceive of the germ-plasm as consisting\r\nof homogeneous units which vary in the development in accordance with\r\nthe diverse regularly alternating influences to which it is exposed\r\nfrom step to step, and that, therefore, in each of these units of very\r\ncomplex structure only a single molecule, or perhaps only a single\r\natom, would need to vary in order that, in the course of development,\r\nthe resulting cell-group should appear in the rudiment in somewhat\r\naltered strength.\r\n\r\nBut I do not believe that a chemical molecule, still less an atom,\r\nis sufficient for this, for reasons which I have already stated--yet\r\nwe need not go into this now, but rather deduce the consequences of\r\nthis admission. It follows that the 'unit' is made up of numerous\r\n'molecules' or 'atoms,' of which each, by dint of changes it has\r\nundergone, causes particular parts of the body to vary in a definite\r\nmanner; in other words, we have here again a theory of determinants,\r\nonly they are on a much smaller scale, since each invisible little\r\nvital particle or 'unit' contains all the determinants within itself,\r\nwhile in my theory it is only the id, that is, the visible chromosome,\r\nwhich includes the determinant complex. Such a theory would be far from\r\na simplification of mine, it would rather complicate it enormously,\r\nand that without anything being gained. At most it would be made more\r\nevident how inconceivably complex the nerve-paths must be which lead\r\nfrom the part that has been modified by exercise to the germ-plasm,\r\nand must also lead to all the innumerable 'molecules or atoms' of the\r\nindividual 'units.' But even on my theory of the composition of the\r\nids as aggregates of living determinants, such nervous transmission of\r\nqualities would be a monstrosity which no one would accept, and I think\r\non this account that my argument as to the impossibility of conceiving\r\nof the transmission of the modifications of the personal part to the\r\ngerminal part retains its force, notwithstanding Hering's interesting\r\nanalogy.\r\n\r\nIf the transmission of functional modifications were an indisputable\r\nfact, I repeat, we should have to give in, and then we might regard the\r\n'memory of organized material' as affording a hint of the possibility\r\nof the unimaginable process. But as long as the occurrence of this\r\ntransmission cannot be proved either directly or indirectly, such\r\na vague possibility of explanation need not induce us to assume an\r\nunproved process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXV\r\n\r\nGERMINAL SELECTION\r\n\r\n On what does disappearance after disuse depend, if not on\r\n the Lamarckian principle?--Panmixia--Romanes--Fluctuations\r\n in the determinant-system of the germ-plasm due to unequal\r\n nutrition--Persistence of germinal variations in a definite\r\n direction--The disappearance of non-functioning parts--Preponderance\r\n of minus germinal variations--Law of the retrogression of\r\n useless parts--Variation in an upward direction--Artificial\r\n selection--Influence of the multiplicity of ids and of sexual\r\n reproduction--Personal selection depends on the removal of certain\r\n id-variants--Range of influence of germinal selection--Self-regulation\r\n of the germ-plasm, which is striving towards stability--Ascending\r\n variation-tendencies may persist to excess--Origin of secondary sexual\r\n characters--Significance of purely morphological characters--The\r\n markings of butterflies.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that we have recognized that the assumption of a transmission of\r\nfunctional modifications is not justifiable, let us discuss some of\r\nthe many phenomena to explain which many people believe the Lamarckian\r\nprinciple to be indispensable, and let us inquire whether we are in a\r\nposition to give any other explanation of these. How has it come about\r\nthat the effects of use and disuse _appear_ to be inherited? Can we\r\nfind a sufficient explanation in the principle of selection, and in the\r\nnatural selection of Darwin and Wallace?\r\n\r\nThe answer to these two questions will be most quickly found if we\r\nbegin by seeking for an explanation of the disappearance of a part when\r\nit ceases to be exercised.\r\n\r\nThat this cannot lie in the Lamarckian principle we have already learnt\r\nfrom the fact that passively functioning parts, such as superfluous\r\nwing-veins, also disappear, and that the loss of the wings and\r\ndegeneration of the ovaries has taken place in worker ants, which can\r\ntransmit nothing because they do not reproduce.\r\n\r\nWe might be inclined to regard this gradual disappearance and ultimate\r\nelimination of a disused organ as a direct gain, on the ground that\r\nthe economy of material and space thus effected may be of decided\r\nadvantage to the individual animal and thereby also for the maintenance\r\nof the species, and that those animals would have an advantage in the\r\nstruggle for existence in which the superfluous organ was reduced to\r\nthe smallest expression. But that would be far from supplying us with\r\na sufficient explanation of the phenomenon; the individual variations\r\nin the size of an organ which is in process of degenerating are,\r\neven in extreme cases, far too slight to have any selection-value,\r\nand I cannot call to mind a single case in which the contrary could\r\nbe assumed with any degree of probability. What advantage can a newt\r\nor a crustacean living in darkness derive from the fact that its eye\r\nis smaller and more degenerate by one degree of variation than those\r\nof its co-partners in the struggle for existence? Or, to use Herbert\r\nSpencer's striking illustration, how could the balance between life and\r\ndeath, in the case of a colossus like the Greenland whale, be turned\r\none way or another by the difference of a few inches in the length of\r\nthe hind-leg, as compared with his fellows, in whom the reduction of\r\nthe hind-limb may not have gone quite so far? Such a slight economy of\r\nmaterial is as nothing compared with the thousands of hundredweights\r\nthe animal weighs. As long as the limbs protrude beyond the surface\r\nof the trunk they may prove an obstacle to rapid swimming, although\r\nthat could hardly make much difference, but as soon as the phyletic\r\nevolution had proceeded so far that they were reduced to the extent of\r\nsinking beneath the surface, they would no longer be a hindrance in\r\nswimming, and their further reduction to their modern state of great\r\ndegeneration and absolute concealment within the flesh of the animal\r\ncannot be referred even to negative selection.\r\n\r\nYears ago I endeavoured to explain the degeneration of disused parts\r\nin terms of a process which I called Panmixia. Natural selection not\r\nonly effects adaptations, it also maintains the organ at the pitch\r\nof perfection it has reached by a continual elimination of those\r\nindividuals in which the organ in question is less perfect. The longer\r\nthis conservative process of selection continues, the greater must be\r\nthe constancy of the organ produced by it, and deviations from the\r\nperfect organ will be of less and less frequent occurrence as time goes\r\non.\r\n\r\nNow if this conservative action of natural selection secures the\r\nmaintenance of the parts and organs of a species at their maximum of\r\nperfection, it follows that these will _fall below this maximum as soon\r\nas the selection ceases to operate_. And it does cease as soon as an\r\norgan ceases to be of use to its species, like the eye to the species\r\nof crustacean which descends into the dark depths of our lakes, or to\r\nthe abyssal zones of the ocean, or into a subterranean cave-system.\r\nIn this case all selection of individuals ceases as far as the eye is\r\nconcerned; it has no importance in deciding survival in the struggle\r\nfor existence, because no individual is at a disadvantage through\r\nits inferior eyes, for instance, by being in any way hindered in\r\nprocuring its food. Those with inferior organs of vision will, _ceteris\r\nparibus_, produce as good offspring as those with better eyes, and the\r\nconsequence of this must be that there will be a general deterioration\r\nof eyes, because the bad ones can be transmitted as well as the good,\r\nand thus the selection of good eyes is made impossible.\r\n\r\nThe mixture thus arising may be compared to a fine wine to which a\r\nlitre of vinegar has been added; the whole cask is ruined because the\r\nvinegar mingles with every drop of the wine. As deviations from the\r\nnormal are always occurring in every part of every species, and among\r\nthem some that lessen the value of the organ, rarely perhaps at first,\r\nbut after a time in every generation, a sinking of the organ from\r\nthe highest point of possible perfection becomes inevitable as soon\r\nas the organ becomes superfluous. The functional uselessness of the\r\norgan must go on increasing the longer it is disused, as will readily\r\nbe admitted if it be remembered that only the most perfect adaptation\r\nof all the separate parts of an organ can maintain its functional\r\ncapacity, that all the parts of an organ are subject to variation, and\r\nthat every deviation from the optimum implies a further deterioration\r\nof the whole. An eye, for instance, can no longer vary in the direction\r\nof 'better' if it has already reached the highest possible point of\r\nperfection; every further variation must deteriorate it.\r\n\r\nRomanes gave expression to this idea, that the cessation of natural\r\nselection alone must cause the degeneration of a part, a decade\r\nbefore I did, but neither he nor the scientific world of his time\r\nattached great importance to it, and it was forgotten again. This was\r\nintelligible enough, for, at that time, the validity of the Lamarckian\r\nprinciple had not been called in question, and therefore the need for\r\nsome other principle to explain the disappearance of disused parts had\r\nnot begun to be felt.\r\n\r\nI found myself in quite a different position. As my doubts regarding\r\nthe Lamarckian principle grew greater and greater, I was obliged to\r\nseek for some other factor in modification, which should be sufficient\r\nto effect the degeneration of a disused part, and for a time I thought\r\nI had found this in panmixia, that is, in the mingling of all together,\r\nwell and less well equipped alike. This factor does certainly operate,\r\nbut the more I thought over it the clearer it became to me that\r\nthere must be some other factor at work as well, for while panmixia\r\nmight explain the deterioration of an organ, it could not explain\r\nits decrease in size, its gradual wearing away, and ultimate total\r\ndisappearance. Yet this is the path followed, slowly indeed, but quite\r\nsurely, by all organs which have become useless. If panmixia alone\r\nguided the deterioration of the organ, and it was thus only chance\r\nvariations which were inherited through panmixia and gradually diffused\r\nover the whole species, how could it come about that all the variations\r\nwere in the direction of smaller size? Yet this is obviously the case.\r\nWhy should no variations in the direction of larger size occur? And\r\nif this were so, why should a useless organ not be maintained at its\r\noriginal size, if it be admitted that an increase in size would be\r\nprevented by natural selection? But this never occurs, and diminution\r\nin size is so absolutely the rule that the idea of a 'vestigial or\r\nrudimentary' organ suggests a 'small organ' almost more than an\r\n'imperfect' one.\r\n\r\nThere must then be something else at work which causes the\r\nminus-variations in a disused organ to preponderate persistently and\r\npermanently over the plus-variations, and this something can lie\r\nnowhere else than where the roots of all hereditary variations are\r\nto be found--in the germ-plasm. This train of thought leads us to\r\nthe discovery of a process which we must call selection between the\r\nelements of the germ-plasm, or, as I have named it shortly, _Germinal\r\nSelection_.\r\n\r\nIf the substance of the germ-plasm is--as we assumed--composed of\r\nheterogeneous living particles, which have dissimilar rôles in the\r\nbuilding up of the organism, there must of necessity be among them\r\na definite labile state of equilibrium, which cannot be disturbed\r\nwithout modifying in some way the structure of the organism itself\r\nwhich arises from the germ-plasm. But if our further view be correct,\r\nthat these individual and different living units of the germ-plasm are\r\n'determinants,' that is, are the primary constituents of particular\r\nparts of the organism, in the sense that these parts could not arise if\r\ntheir determinants were absent from the germ-plasm, and that they would\r\nbe different if the determinants were differently composed, we can draw\r\nfar-reaching deductions.\r\n\r\nIt is true that we cannot learn _anything directly_ in regard to the\r\nintimate structure of the germ-plasm, and even in regard to the vital\r\nprocesses going on within it we can only guess a very little, but so\r\nmuch we may say--that its living parts are nourished, and that they\r\nmultiply. But it follows from this that nourishment in a dissolved\r\nstate must penetrate between its vital particles, and that whether the\r\ndeterminants grow, and at what rate they do so, depends mainly on the\r\namount of nourishment which reaches them. As long as the germ-cells\r\nmultiply by division the determinants have no other function but\r\nto grow; a part of their substance undergoes oxidation and thereby\r\nyields the supply of energy necessary to assimilation, that is, to the\r\nformation of new living substance.\r\n\r\nIf each kind of determinant always secured the same quantity of\r\nnourishment, all would grow in the same degree, that is, in exact\r\nproportion to their power of assimilation. But we know that in less\r\nminute conditions which we can observe more directly, there is\r\nnowhere absolute equality, that all vital processes are subject to\r\nfluctuations; any little obstacles in the current of the nutritive\r\nfluid, or in its composition, may cause poorer nutrition of one\r\npart, better of another. We may therefore assume that there are\r\nsimilar irregularities and differences in the minute and unobservable\r\nconditions of the germ-plasm likewise, and the result must be a slight\r\nshifting of the position of equilibrium as regards size and strength in\r\nthe determinant system; for the less well-nourished determinants will\r\ngrow more slowly, will fail to attain to the size and strength of their\r\nneighbours, and will multiply more slowly.\r\n\r\nBut the vigour of growth does not depend only on the influence of\r\nnourishment; one cell grows quickly, another slowly in the same\r\nnutritive fluid; it depends in great part on the cell's power\r\nof assimilation. In the same way the assimilating power of the\r\ndeterminants and their affinity for nourishment will vary with their\r\nconstitution, and a weaker determinant will remain smaller than a\r\nstronger one, even when the stream of nourishment is the same.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that it is upon the unequal nutrition of the\r\ndeterminants conditioned by the chances of the food-supply that\r\nindividual hereditary variability ultimately depends. If, for instance,\r\nthe determinant _A_ receives poorer nourishment at a particular time\r\nthan the determinant _B_, it will grow more slowly, remain weaker, and\r\nthen, when the germ-cells develop into an animal, the part to which it\r\ngives rise will be weaker than it usually is in other individuals.\r\n\r\nThese primary inequalities in the equipment of the determinants which\r\nare caused by a passing inequality in the food-stream are, of course,\r\nso slight that we are unable to observe their consequences. They must\r\npersist for a considerable time before they become observable, but\r\nthey may persist for a long time, and their effect must then mount\r\nup, because every diminution in the strength of the determinant also\r\nsignifies a lessened power of assimilation, and growth becomes slower\r\nfor the twofold reason that passive and active nutrition decrease\r\nat the same time. In the less minute conditions observable in the\r\nhistological elements of the body we know that function strengthens\r\nthe organ, and that disuse weakens it, and we are justified in\r\napplying this proposition also to these more intimate conditions and\r\nminuter vital units. Thus, in the course of the multiplication of\r\nthe germ-cells, the less vigorously working determinant, _A_, will\r\ngradually, but very slowly, become weaker, that is, of diminished\r\npower of assimilation, presupposing of course that the intra-germinal\r\nfood-stream does not become stronger again at the same place--a\r\npossibility to which I shall subsequently refer. But while one\r\ndeterminant may be slowly becoming weaker, its neighbour, on the other\r\nhand, may be varying on an ascending scale, just because the former is,\r\non account of its diminished power of assimilation, no longer able to\r\nexhaust completely the food-stream which flows to it.\r\n\r\nThe determinants are thus in constant motion, here ascending, there\r\ndescending, and it is in these fluctuations of the equilibrium of the\r\ndeterminant-system that I see the roots of all hereditary variation,\r\nwhile in the fact that the variation-directions of particular\r\ndeterminants must continue the same without limit as long as they meet\r\nwith no obstacle lies the possibility of the adaptation of the organism\r\nto changing conditions, the increase and transformation of one part,\r\nthe degeneration and disappearance of another, in short, the processes\r\nof natural selection. The reason why such variation movements must\r\ncontinue until they meet some resistance is that every chance upward\r\nor downward movement--due, that is, to mere passive fluctuation in the\r\nfood-supply, at the same time strengthens or weakens the determinant,\r\nand makes it either more or less capable of attracting nourishment to\r\nitself; in the former case an increasingly strong stream of food will\r\nbe directed towards it, in the latter more and more of the available\r\nfood-supply will be withdrawn from it by its neighbour-determinants\r\non all sides; in the former the determinant will go on increasing\r\nin strength as long as it can go on attracting more nourishment, in\r\nthe latter it will continue to become weaker until it disappears\r\naltogether. To the ascending progression, as is evident, there are\r\nlimits set, not only by the amount of food which can circulate through\r\nthe whole id, but also by the neighbour determinants, which will sooner\r\nor later resist the withdrawal of nourishment from them; but for the\r\ndescending progression there are no limits except total disappearance,\r\nand this is actually reached in all cases in which the determinants are\r\nrelated to a part which has become useless. But both these movements,\r\nthe upward and the downward alike, are quite independent of natural\r\nselection, i.e. of personal selection; they are processes of a unique\r\nkind which run their course purely in accordance with intra-germinal\r\nlaws. Whether a determinant 'ascends' or 'descends' depends solely\r\nupon the play of forces within the germ-plasm, not upon whether the\r\ndirection of the variation in question is useful or prejudicial, or\r\non whether the organ in question, the determinate, is of value or\r\notherwise. In this fact lies the great importance of this play of\r\nforces within the germ-plasm, that it gives rise to variations quite\r\nindependently of the relations of the organism to the external world.\r\nIn many cases, of course, personal selection intervenes, but even then\r\nit cannot directly effect the rising or falling of _the individual_\r\ndeterminants--these are processes quite outside of its influence--but\r\nit can, by eliminating the bearers of unfavourably varying\r\ndeterminants, set a limit to further advance in such directions. This\r\nwe shall consider in more detail later on. Personal selection operates\r\nby removing unfavourably varying individuals from the genealogical tree\r\nof the species, but at the same time the determinants which are varying\r\nunfavourably are also removed, and their variation is thus put a stop\r\nto for all time.\r\n\r\nI have called these processes which are ceaselessly going on within the\r\ngerm-plasm, Germinal Selection, because they are analogous to those\r\nprocesses of selection which we already know in connexion with the\r\nlarger vital units, cells, cell-groups and persons. If the germ-plasm\r\nbe a system of determinants, then the same laws of struggle for\r\nexistence in regard to food and multiplication must hold sway among its\r\nparts which hold sway between all systems of vital units--among the\r\nbiophors which form the protoplasm of the cell-body, among the cells of\r\na tissue, among the tissues of an organ, among the organs themselves,\r\nas well as among the individuals of a species and between species which\r\ncompete with one another.\r\n\r\nIf this be the case, we have here ready to hand the explanation of\r\nevery heritable variation of a part, ascending and descending alike.\r\nLet us consider for a little the latter category--that is, the\r\ndisappearance of functionless _or useless organs_. It is clear that,\r\nfrom the moment in the life of a species that an organ, _N_, becomes\r\nuseless, natural selection withdraws her hand from it; individuals\r\nwith better or worse organs _N_ are now equally capable of life and\r\nstruggle, the state of panmixia is entered upon, and the organ _N_\r\nof necessity falls somewhat below its previously attained degree of\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThat this must be so will be admitted when it is remembered that each\r\norgan of a species is only maintained at its highest level because\r\npersonal selection keeps ceaseless watch over it, and sets aside all\r\nthe less favourable variations by eliminating the individuals which\r\nexhibit them. But this is no longer the case with a useless organ. When\r\na weaker variant of a disused organ arises through the intra-germinal\r\nfluctuations of nutrition, this is transmitted to the descendants\r\njust as well as the normally developed organ, and in the course of\r\ngenerations will be inherited by a greater and greater number of\r\nindividuals, and must ultimately be inherited by all in some degree or\r\nother. The objection has been urged from many sides that variations\r\nupwards would be quite as likely to arise as those downwards, but\r\nthis is an error. Even if, at the beginning, the minus-variations\r\nwere rarer than the plus-variations, in the course of generations\r\nthe minus ones would preponderate because ascending variations of\r\ndisused organs are not indifferent for the organism but injurious to\r\nit. Perhaps an increase in the size of the organ itself would do no\r\nharm, but in that of its determinant it certainly would, because an\r\nascending determinant requires more nourishment than previously, and\r\nwithdraws it from its surroundings, and thus from the determinants in\r\nits immediate neighbourhood; but these are those of functioning and\r\nindispensable parts. Individuals in whose germ-plasm the determinants\r\nof disused organs ascend, and thereby depress the determinants of\r\norgans which are still active, are subject to personal selection,\r\nand are eliminated. There thus remain only those with descending\r\ndeterminants; in other words, the chance of variants in the direction\r\nof weakness in useless determinants far outweighs that of variants in\r\nthe direction of increased strength; the latter will soon cease to\r\noccur at all, for as soon as a determinant has fallen a little below\r\nits normal level, it finds itself upon an inclined plane, along which\r\nit glides very slowly but steadily downwards. This might be disputed if\r\nit could be maintained that, at every stage of the descent, a change\r\nof direction was possible. But this probably takes place rarely and\r\nonly in the case of individual ids, and will therefore not be permanent\r\nbecause in general the stronger neighbour determinants will possess\r\nthemselves of the superfluous nourishment, and a lasting ascent will\r\nthus be impossible to the weakened determinant. This is precisely what\r\nI have called Germinal Selection. The determinant whose assimilating\r\npower is weakened by ever so little is continually being robbed by\r\nits neighbours of a part of the nourishment which flows towards it,\r\nand must consequently become further weakened. As no more help will\r\nbe given to it by natural selection, since the organ is no longer of\r\nany value to the species, the better among the weakened determinants\r\nof _N_ are never selected out, and they must gradually give way in the\r\nstruggle with the neighbouring determinants which are necessary to the\r\nspecies, becoming gradually weaker and ultimately disappearing.\r\n\r\nThis process can, of course, no more be proved mathematically than\r\nany other biological processes. No one who is unwilling to accept\r\ngerminal selection can be compelled to do so, as he might be to accept\r\nthe Pythagorean propositions. It is not built up from beneath upon\r\naxioms, but is an attempt at an explanation of a fact established by\r\nobservation--the disappearance of disused parts. But when once the\r\ninheritance of functional modifications has been demonstrated to be a\r\nfallacy, and when it has been shown that, even with the assumption of\r\nsuch inheritance, the disappearance of parts which are only _passively_\r\nuseful, and of any parts whatever in sterile animal forms, remains\r\nunexplained, he who rejects germinal selection must renounce all\r\nattempt at explanation. It is the same as in the case of personal\r\nselection. No one can demonstrate mathematically that any variation\r\npossesses selection value, but whoever rejects personal selection gives\r\nup hope of explaining adaptations, for these cannot be referred to\r\npurely internal forces of development.\r\n\r\nThe total disappearance of a part which has become useless takes place\r\nwith exceeding slowness; the whales, which have existed as such since\r\nthe beginning of the tertiary period, have even now not completely lost\r\ntheir hind-limbs, but carry them about with them as rudiments in the\r\nmuscular mass of the trunk, and the birds, which are even older, still\r\nshow in their embryonic primordia the five fingers of their reptilian\r\nforefathers, although even their bird-ancestors of the Jurassic period,\r\nif we may argue from _Archæopteryx_, had only three fingers like our\r\nmodern birds. A long series of similar examples might be given, and\r\nmodern embryology in particular has contributed much that, like this\r\nexample of birds' fingers, points to a certain orderliness in the\r\ndisappearance of the individual parts of an organ which has become\r\nsuperfluous. Parts which, in the complete animal, have disappeared\r\nwithout leaving a trace, appear again in each embryonic primordium, and\r\ndisappear in the course of the ontogeny. Speaking metaphorically, we\r\nmight express this on the basis of the determinant theory, by saying\r\nthat the determinants, as they become weaker, can only control an\r\nincreasingly short period of the whole ontogeny of the organ, so that\r\nultimately nothing more than its first beginning comes into existence.\r\nBut this is only a metaphor; we cannot tell what really happens as\r\nlong as we are ignorant of the physiological rôle of the determinants,\r\nand even of the laws governing the degeneration of a useless organ.\r\nIn respect of the latter, much might still be achieved if comparative\r\nanatomy and embryology were studied with this definite end in view, and\r\nperhaps we should even be able to draw more definite conclusions in\r\nregard to the composition and activity of the determinants in the germ.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we must be content with the knowledge that, on the\r\ndeterminant hypothesis, the disappearance of organs which have\r\nbecome useless may be regarded as a process of intra-selection going\r\non between the 'primary constituents' (_Anlagen_) of the germ, and\r\ndepending on the same principle of the 'struggle of parts' which\r\nWilliam Roux introduced into science with such brilliant results. If a\r\nstruggle for food and space actually takes place, then every passive\r\nweakening must lead to a permanent condition of weakness and a lasting\r\nand irretrievable diminution in the size and strength of the primary\r\nconstituent concerned, unless personal selection intervenes, and\r\nchoosing out the strongest among these weakened primary constituents,\r\nraises them again to their former level. But this never happens when\r\nthe organ has become useless.\r\n\r\nThis explains why not only parts with active function, like limbs,\r\nmuscles, tendons, nerves, and glands, disappear when they cease to\r\nfunction, but also passive parts like the colouring of the external\r\nsurfaces of animals, the lifeless skeletal parts of Arthropods and the\r\nexact adaptation of their thickness to the dwindling function, the\r\ndisappearance of superfluous wing-veins, and of the hard chitinous\r\ncovering of the abdomen when it is concealed in a protecting house,\r\nas in the case of hermit-crabs, Phryganidæ, and Psychidæ. Here too we\r\nfind a sufficient explanation of the fact that parts which have become\r\nfunctionless, such as the wings of ants, can disappear even in the case\r\nof sterile workers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe principle of germinal selection, however, can only be understood\r\nin its full significance if we take the positive aspect also into\r\nconsideration. We had reached the conclusion that because of the\r\nfluctuations of the food-supply one set of the homologous determinants\r\nrepresented in the various ids may vary in a minus direction, and\r\nanother set in a plus direction, and that this direction will be\r\nadhered to as long as no intra-germinal obstacles come in the way. As\r\nlong as this does not happen the determinant concerned will pursue the\r\npath of variation it has once struck out, and indeed the tendency will\r\nbe strengthened, because every passive variation, upwards or downwards,\r\nresults in a strengthening or weakening of the determinant's power of\r\nassimilation.\r\n\r\nLet us take a case of positive variation of the determinants of an\r\norgan _N_, which would be more useful to the species if it were\r\nmore highly developed than it had previously been. The variation in\r\nan upward direction is at first purely passive, having arisen from\r\nfluctuations in the food-supply, but it soon becomes active, since the\r\ndeterminants that have become stronger will have a stronger affinity\r\nfor food and will attract more and more of the available supply. The\r\nincreased food-stream is thus maintained, and its gradual result is\r\nsuch a strengthening of the determinants in the course of generations\r\nof germ-cells, that the parts controlled by these determinants--the\r\ndeterminates--must enter on a path of plus-variations. If to this\r\nthere be added personal selection, either natural or artificial, any\r\nfluctuations of this primary constituent towards the minus side will be\r\neffectually prevented, the direction of variation will remain positive,\r\nand the continued intervention of personal selection may raise its\r\ndevelopment to its possible maximum, that is, so far that further\r\ndevelopment in the same direction would not make for greater fitness,\r\nand personal selection must call a halt. This will always happen as\r\nsoon as further increase of the organ would be prejudicial to the\r\nliving power of the whole, and when the harmony of the bodily parts\r\nwould thereby be permanently disturbed.\r\n\r\nThat variation in an upward direction really can persist for a long\r\ntime is shown by artificial selection as practised by Man in regard\r\nto his domesticated animals and cultivated plants. At first general\r\nvariability, or at least variability in many directions, sets in as\r\na result of the greatly altered conditions of life; the ordinary\r\nfluctuations of the determinants are intensified by the greater\r\nfluctuations in the nutritive stream, and it becomes possible for Man\r\nconsciously or unconsciously to select for breeding whatever he prefers\r\namong the chance variations that arise in individual parts or in whole\r\ncomplexes of parts, and he may thus give rise to a long-continued,\r\noften apparently unlimited, augmentation of variations in the same\r\ndirection, although he cannot exercise _any direct_ influence upon\r\nthe germ-plasm or its determinants. When a determinant has assumed\r\na certain variation-direction it will follow it up of itself, and\r\nselection can do nothing more than secure it a free course by setting\r\naside variations in other directions by means of the elimination of\r\nthose that exhibit them.\r\n\r\nThat artificial selection can cause the increase of a part has long\r\nbeen established, but in what way this is possible, and how it can\r\nbe theoretically explained has hitherto been very obscure, for even\r\nif we take the favourable case that both parents possess the desired\r\nvariation, it cannot be supposed that the characters of the parents\r\nare, so to speak, added together in the child; all we can say is that\r\nthe probability that the children will also exhibit the character\r\nin question--for instance, a long or crooked nose--becomes greater.\r\nCertainly an increase of the character may result if in both parents\r\nthe determinants _K_ are present in excess as compared with the\r\nheterodynamous determinants _K´_ and _K´´_, for in that case there\r\nis an increased probability that, through reducing divisions and\r\namphimixis, there will again be a preponderance of the determinants\r\n_K_ composing the germ-plasm of the child, and further, that these\r\ndeterminants _K_ will dominate strongly as compared with the few\r\n_K´_'s. It may thus happen that the long nose of the two parents\r\nwill give rise to a still longer nose in the child, or that parents\r\nof considerable bodily size may have still bigger children, but such\r\nincrease would be confined to one generation, and would not lead to a\r\npermanent increase of the character; permanent increase cannot depend\r\nmerely on the number of the determinants _K_ and on their supremacy\r\nover their converse, the determinants _K´_; it must also depend on\r\ntheir own variation, and this again can depend only on germinal\r\nselection and not upon personal selection, although the former can be\r\nmaterially assisted by the latter.\r\n\r\nThat inheritance from both parents is only a secondary consideration\r\nin regard to the increase of a part by artificial selection is made\r\nevident by the fact that _many secondary sexual characters_ have been\r\nmodified, although the breeder selected only in regard to one parent.\r\nNevertheless in this very domain the greatest results have been\r\nachieved; witness the Japanese breed of cocks with tail-feathers six\r\nfeet long. This astonishing result has been reached by the strictest\r\nselection of the cocks in which the feathers were a little longer\r\nthan those of other cocks, and the increase in the length of feathers\r\ndepended--according to our theory--simply on the fact that, by the\r\nselection of the determinants which were already varying in the\r\ndirection of increased length, this process of increase was guarded\r\nfrom interruption by chance unfavourable conditions of nutrition.\r\nThe continuance of variation in the upward direction in which it had\r\nalready started is not effected directly by personal selection, but\r\nis so indirectly, for without this constant fresh intervention of\r\nselection the increase would be apt to come to a standstill, or the\r\nvariation might even take a contrary direction. There are two other\r\nfactors operative to which we have not yet given sufficient attention.\r\nThey are, the multiplicity of the ids in every germ-plasm, and sexual\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\nIf--as we must assume--each germ-plasm is made up of several or many\r\nids, there must be several or many determinants of each part of the\r\norganism, for each id contains potentially the whole organism, though\r\nwith some individuality of expression. The child is thus not determined\r\nby the determinants of a single id, but by those of many ids, and the\r\nvariations of any part of the body do not depend on the variations of a\r\nsingle determinant _X_, but on the co-operation of all the determinants\r\n_X_ which are contained in the collective ids of the relevant\r\ngerm-plasm. Thus it is only when a majority of the determinants have\r\nvaried upwards or downwards that they dominate collectively the\r\ndevelopment of the part _X´_ and cause it to be larger or smaller.\r\n\r\nWe have assumed passive fluctuations in nutrition to be the first\r\ncause in individual variation, and it is obvious that the action of\r\nthis first cause of dissimilarity must be greatly restricted by the\r\nmultiplicity of the ids and the corresponding homologous determinants.\r\nFor although passive fluctuations in nutrition should occur continually\r\nin the case of all determinants, this would not imply that they would\r\nfollow the same direction in all the determinants _X_ of all ids, for\r\nsome determinants _X_ might vary upwards, and others downwards, and\r\nthese might counteract each other in ontogeny; so that in many cases\r\nthe fluctuations of the individual determinants will not be felt in\r\ntheir products at all. But since there are--as we shall see later--only\r\ntwo directions of variation, upwards and downwards, plus and minus,\r\nit must also sometimes happen that a majority take one direction, and\r\nthis affords the basis on which germinal selection can build further,\r\nand on which it is materially supported by reducing division and the\r\nsubsequent amphimixis.\r\n\r\nFor reducing division removes half of the ids and thus of the\r\ndeterminants from the mature germ-cell, and according as chance leaves\r\ntogether or separates a majority of _X_-determinants varying in the\r\nsame direction, this particular germ-cell will contain the primary\r\nconstituents of a plus- or of a minus-variation of _X_, and it is\r\npossible that the presence of a majority or a minority may be entirely\r\ndue to the reduction. The germ-plasm of the parent may contain,\r\nfor instance, the determinant _X_ in its twenty ids 12 times in\r\nminus-variation form, 8 times in plus-variation form; and the reducing\r\ndivision, according to our view, may separate these into two groups\r\nof which one contains eight plus- and two minus-variations, the other\r\nten minus-variations, or the one six plus- and four minus-variations,\r\nthe other two plus- and eight minus-variations, and so on. Now every\r\ngerm-cell which contains a majority of plus- or minus-variations--and\r\nthis must be the case with most of them--may unite, if it attains to\r\namphimixis, with a germ-cell which also contains a majority of plus\r\nor minus _X_-determinants, and if similar majorities let us say\r\nplus--meet together, the plus-variation of _X_ must be all the more\r\nsharply emphasized in the child.\r\n\r\nThus, although the individual determinants _X_ may not be incited to\r\nfurther variation by their co-operation with others varying in the\r\nsame direction, the collective effect of the plus-determinants will\r\nbe greater, and adherence to the same direction of variation in the\r\nfollowing generation will be assured, for if in the germ-plasm of the\r\nparent there be, for instance, sixteen out of twenty determinants\r\npossessing the plus-variation, a minus-majority can no longer result\r\nfrom reducing division.\r\n\r\nIt is upon this that the operation of natural selection, that is,\r\npersonal selection, must depend--that the germ-plasms in which the\r\nfavourable variation-direction is in the majority are selected for\r\nbreeding, for it is this and nothing else that natural selection does\r\nwhen it selects the individuals which possess the preferred variations.\r\nThe ascending process is thus considerably advanced, because the\r\nopposing determinants are more and more eliminated from the germ-plasm,\r\ntill the preferred variations of _X_ are left, and among these, as\r\nascent in the direction begun continues, the opposing variations\r\nare again set aside by germinal selection, and so on. Reducing\r\ndivisions and amphimixis are thus powerful factors in furthering\r\nthe transformations of the forms of life, although they are not the\r\nultimate causes of these.\r\n\r\nNow that we have made ourselves familiar with the idea of germinal\r\nselection we shall attempt to gain clearness as to what it can do,\r\nand how far the sphere of its influence extends, and, in particular,\r\nwhether it can effect lasting transformations of species without the\r\nco-operation of personal selection, and what kind of variations we may\r\nascribe to it alone.\r\n\r\nFirst, I must return for a moment to the question we have already\r\nbriefly discussed--whether the variation of a determinant upwards or\r\ndownwards must so continue without limit. We might be inclined to\r\nthink that the great constancy which many species exhibit was a plain\r\ncontradiction of this, for if every minute variation of a determinant\r\nnecessarily persisted without limit in the same direction, we should\r\nexpect to find all the parts of the organism in a state of continual\r\nunrest, some varying upwards, some downwards, always ready to break the\r\ntype of the species. Must there not be some internal self-regulation\r\nof the germ-plasm which makes it impossible that every variation\r\nwhich crops up can persist unlimitedly? Must there not be some kind\r\nof automatic control on the part of the germ-plasm, which is always\r\nstriving to re-establish the state of equilibrium that has once been\r\nattained by the determinant system whenever it is disturbed?\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to give any confident answer to this question. We\r\ncannot reach clearness on this point through our present knowledge\r\nof the germ-plasm, because we possess no insight into its structure;\r\nwe can only draw conclusions as to the processes in the germ-plasm\r\nfrom the observed phenomena of variation and inheritance. But two\r\nfacts stand in direct antithesis to one another, first, the high\r\npower of adaptation possessed by all species, and the undoubted\r\noccurrence of unrestricted persistence in a given direction of\r\nvariation, as seen in artificial selection, and in the disappearance\r\nof parts which have ceased to function; and, secondly, the great\r\nconstancy of old-established species which do indeed always exhibit a\r\ncertain degree of individual variability, but without showing marked\r\ndeviations as a frequent occurrence or in all possible directions,\r\nas they certainly would if every determinant favoured by a chance\r\nincrease in the nutritive stream necessarily and irresistibly went on\r\nvarying further in the same direction. Or can the constancy of such\r\nspecies be maintained solely by means of personal selection, which\r\nis continually setting aside all the determinants which rise above\r\nthe selection-value by eliminating their possessors? I was for long\r\nsatisfied that this was the true solution of the difficulty, and even\r\nnow I do not doubt that personal selection does, in point of fact,\r\nmaintain the constancy of the species at a certain level, but I do not\r\nbelieve that this is sufficient, but rather that it is necessary to\r\nrecognize an equalizing influence due to germinal selection, and to\r\nattribute to this a share in maintaining the constancy of a species\r\nwhich has long been well adapted. I am led to this assumption chiefly\r\nby the phenomena of variation in Man, for we find in him a thousand\r\nkinds of minute hereditary individual variations, of which not one is\r\nlikely to attain to selection value. Of course the constant recurrence\r\nof reducing divisions prevents any particular id which contains a\r\nvarying determinant from being inherited through many generations; for\r\nso many ids are being continually removed from the genealogical tree\r\nby the constant rejection of the half of all ids of every germ-plasm,\r\nthat only a small part of the ancestral id remains in the grandchild,\r\ngreat-grandchild, and so on. Certainly some of the ids of the ancestors\r\ncompose the germ-plasm of the descendants, and if all the determinants\r\nof one of these ids had begun to vary persistently upwards or downwards\r\nin an ancestor, then all the determinants of the relative id in the\r\ndescendants would possess the variation in an intensified degree; and\r\nhowever slowly the variation advanced it would attain selection-value\r\nin some one or other of the descendants, and would thus break\r\nthe previously stable type of the most perfectly adapted species.\r\nThe descendant in question would then succumb in the struggle for\r\nexistence. But as the number of the determinants in the germ-plasm is\r\nprobably much greater than that of the descendants of one generation,\r\nevery descendant would in the course of time deviate unfavourably in\r\nsome one character from the type of the species, and then either all\r\nthe descendants would be eliminated or the type would become unstable.\r\nBut neither of these things happens, and there are undoubtedly\r\nspecies which remain constant for long periods of time, therefore the\r\nassumption must be false and every variation of a determinant does not\r\nof necessity go on in the same direction without limit.\r\n\r\nI therefore suppose that although slight variations are ceaselessly\r\ntaking place upwards or downwards in all determinants, even in constant\r\nspecies, the majority of these turn again in the other direction before\r\nthey have attained to any important degree of increase, at least in\r\nthe germ-plasm of all species which have had a definitely established\r\nequilibrium for thousands of generations. In such a germ-plasm, or\r\nto speak more precisely, in the id of such a germ-plasm, marked\r\nfluctuations in the nutritive stream will not be likely to occur as\r\nlong as the external conditions are unchanged, but slight fluctuations,\r\nwhich will not be wanting even here, may often alternate and turn in\r\nan opposite direction, and thus the upward movement of a determinant\r\nmay be transformed into a downward one. Every determinant is surrounded\r\nby several others, and we can imagine that the regular nutritive\r\nstream which we have assumed may be partially dammed up by a slight\r\nenlargement of the determinant, and that this will drive the surplus\r\nback again. But however we may picture these conditions, which are for\r\nall time outside of the sphere of observation, the assumption of a\r\nself-regulation of the germ-plasm, up to a certain degree, cannot be\r\nregarded as inconceivable or unphysiological.\r\n\r\nBut there are limits to this self-regulation; as soon as the increase\r\nor decrease of a determinant attains a certain degree, as soon as it\r\nhas got beyond the first slight deviation, it overcomes all obstacles,\r\nand goes on increasing in the direction in which it has started.\r\nThis must happen even in the case of old and constant species, and\r\nfrequently enough to admit of an apparent capacity for adaptation in\r\nall directions. Every part of a species can vary beyond the usual\r\nindividual fluctuations, and as this is possible only by means of\r\nintra-germinal processes, we must assume that even in the case of\r\ngerm-plasms which have long remained in a state of stable equilibrium\r\nthere may occasionally be marked fluctuations in the nutritive stream,\r\nand thus more than usually pronounced variations of the determinants\r\naffected by it will occur. These yield the material for new adaptations\r\nif they are in the direction of fitness, or they are eliminated either\r\nby the chances of reducing division or by personal selection if new\r\nadaptations are not required.\r\n\r\nThe old-established hereditary equilibrium of the germ-plasm must be\r\nmost easily disturbed when the species is in some way brought into new\r\nconditions of existence, as, for instance, when plants or animals are\r\ndomesticated, and when in consequence, as we have already assumed, the\r\nnutritive currents within the id gradually alter, quantitatively and\r\nqualitatively; and on this account alone certain kinds of determinants\r\nare favoured, while others are at a disadvantage. In this way there\r\narises the intensified general variability of domesticated animals\r\nand cultivated plants which has been known since the time of Darwin.\r\nSomething analogous to this must occur in natural conditions, though\r\nmore slowly, when a species is subjected to a change of climatic\r\nconditions, but we shall discuss this later on in more detail.\r\n\r\nWe have thus arrived at the idea that the slight variations of the\r\ndeterminants may be counteracted whether they be directed upwards or\r\ndownwards, and that in the case of so-called constant species they\r\ndo frequently equalize themselves; but that more marked variations,\r\nproduced by more pronounced nutritive fluctuations, may in a sense go\r\non without limit, and then can only be restricted and controlled by\r\npersonal selection, that is, by the removal of the ids concerned from\r\nthe genealogical lineage of the species.\r\n\r\nIn one direction variation can be proved to go on without limit, and\r\nthat is downwards, as is proved by the fact of the disappearance of\r\n_disused organs_, for here we have a variation-direction, which has\r\nbeen followed to its utmost limit, and which is completely independent\r\nof personal selection; it proceeds quite _uninterfered with_ by\r\npersonal selection, and is left entirely to itself. It is a significant\r\nfact that the disappearance of the individual parts of a larger organ,\r\naccording to all the data that are as yet available, proceeds at a\r\nvery _unequal rate_, so that it evidently depends to a great extent on\r\nchance whether a disused part begins to degenerate sooner or later.\r\nThus in one of the Crustaceans living in the darkness of the caves of\r\nNorth America the optic lobes and optic nerves have disappeared, while\r\nthe retina of the eye, the lens, and the pigment have been retained,\r\nand in others the reverse has taken place, and the nerve-centres\r\nhave persisted while the parts of the eye have been lost (Packard).\r\nVariations of the relevant determinants towards the minus direction\r\nmay thus occur, sometimes sooner, sometimes later; but when once they\r\nhave started they proceed irresistibly, though with exceeding slowness.\r\n\r\nBut variation in an upward direction also, when it has once been set\r\na-going, may in many cases go on unchecked until limits are set to\r\nit by personal selection, when the excess of the organ would disturb\r\nthe harmony of the parts, or in any other way lessen the individual's\r\nchances of survival in the struggle for existence. This is proved\r\nespecially by the phenomena of artificial selection, for almost all\r\nthe parts of fowls and pigeons have been caused to vary to excess by\r\nbreeding, and must thus have been, so to speak, capable of unlimited\r\nincrease; and yet, as we have seen, personal selection cannot directly\r\ncause progress in any direction of variation; it can only secure a\r\nfree course by excluding from breeding the bearers of variations\r\nwith an opposite tendency. The beards of hens, the tail-feathers of\r\nthe long-tailed domestic cocks, the long and short, straight and\r\ncurved bills of pigeons, the enormously long ruffled feathers of the\r\nJacobin, the multiplication of the tail-feathers in the fan-tail, and\r\ninnumerable other breed-characters of these playthings of the breeder,\r\nprove that when variation-tendencies of any part are once present, that\r\nis, when they have arisen through germinal selection, they apparently\r\ngo on unchecked until their further development would permanently and\r\nirretrievably destroy the harmony of the parts. As soon as this is\r\nthreatened the breed loses its power of survival, and Darwin in his\r\ntime cited the case of many extremely short-billed breeds of pigeon,\r\nwhich require the aid of the breeder before they can emerge from the\r\nhard-shelled egg, because their short and soft bills no longer allow\r\nthem to break their way out. Here the correlation between the hardness\r\nof the egg-shell and that of the pigeon's bill has been disturbed, and\r\nthe breed can now only be kept in existence by artificial aid.\r\n\r\nThere must be a possibility of something similar occurring in natural\r\nconditions, and when it does the species concerned must die out. But in\r\nthe majority of cases the self-regulation which is afforded by personal\r\nselection will be enough to force back an organ which is in the act\r\nof increasing out of due proportion to within its proper limits. The\r\nbearers of such excessively increased determinants succumb in the\r\nstruggle for existence, and the determinants are thus removed from the\r\ngenealogical lineage of the species.\r\n\r\nHaving now established the fact that determinants can continue their\r\ndirection of variation without limit because of internal, that is\r\nintra-germinal, reasons, we have come nearer an understanding of\r\nmany secondary sexual characters, whose resemblance to the excessive\r\ndevelopments artificially produced in our domestic poultry is so\r\nvery striking. Here, too, we shall have to regard germinal selection\r\nas the root of the variations of plumage and other distinguishing\r\ncharacters, which have evolved by intra-germinal augmentation into\r\nthe magnificently coloured crests, tufts, and collars, into the long\r\nor graduated, multiplied or erectile tail-feathers of the birds of\r\nParadise, pheasants, and humming-birds. The conception of sexual\r\nselection formulated by Darwin will be so far modified, that we are no\r\nlonger compelled to regard every minute step in this cumulative process\r\nas due to the selection of the males by the females. A preference of\r\nthe finest males may still take place, and is probably general, since\r\nonly thus could the distinguishing male characters become common\r\nproperty, that is, be transmitted to all or the majority of the ids\r\nof the germ-plasm, but the increase of the individual determinants\r\nwhich are in the act of varying goes on in each individual id, quite\r\nindependently of this personal selection.\r\n\r\nAs it is not a single id with its determinant _a_ in ascending\r\nvariation that controls the organ _A_, but as it always requires\r\na majority of the ids _a_, this must be secured here by personal\r\nselection just as it is in ordinary natural selection. If the\r\nhandsomest males are the successful competitors, then a majority of\r\nthe transformed ids _a´_ will be transmitted to a number of their\r\ndescendants, and the oftener this happens the larger will the majority\r\nbe, and the less becomes the danger that it will be dispersed again\r\nby reducing division and amphimixis. Personal selection is thus in\r\nno way rendered superfluous by germinal selection, only it does not\r\nproduce the augmentation of the distinguishing characters, but is\r\nchiefly instrumental in fixing them in the germ-plasm; it collects,\r\nso to speak, only the favourably varying ids, and, where complex\r\nvariations depending on the proper variation of many ids are concerned,\r\nit combines these. How very great the influence of personal selection\r\nmay be in this case of secondary sexual characters we see clearly from\r\nthe soberly coloured mates of the brilliant males, for here natural\r\nselection has been operative in conserving the coloration inherited\r\nfrom remote ancestry.\r\n\r\nBut if the question be asked, how _the first majority_ of determinants\r\nvarying in the same direction is brought about, there are two\r\npossibilities: first, by chance, and secondly, by influences which\r\ncause particular determinants of all the ids to vary in almost exactly\r\nthe same manner. We shall find illustrations of the latter among\r\nclimatic varieties; but the cases of the first kind are the more\r\nimportant, for they form the foundation and the starting-point for\r\nprocesses of selection of a higher order, for personal selection. It\r\nmight seem perplexing that processes of such importance should depend\r\nultimately upon chance; but when we remember that there are only two\r\ndirections of variation, namely a plus direction or a minus direction,\r\nwe recognize that the chance of a majority in one direction or another\r\nis much greater than that of absolute equilibrium between the two, and\r\nthere is therefore a very strong probability that in many individuals\r\nof the species either the upward or the downward movement of a\r\ndeterminant _A_ will preponderate.\r\n\r\nNow as such variation movements, when they are of a certain strength,\r\nincrease automatically, we can easily see that they must gradually\r\nattain to a level at which they acquire selection value, and how then,\r\nby personal selection, the ids with favourably varying determinants may\r\nbe collected together.\r\n\r\nOf course it is not possible to state positively the time at which\r\nin individual cases a variation acquires a biological significance,\r\nthat is, selection value. We can only say in a general way that, as\r\nsoon as it attains this, personal selection either in a positive or a\r\nnegative sense _must_ intervene; an injurious variation tends to the\r\nelimination of its possessor, a useful one increases the probability of\r\nits survival.\r\n\r\nThere must, however, be for every variation a stage of development in\r\nwhich it has as yet no decisive biological importance, and this stage\r\nneed not by any means be so insignificant that we cannot see it, or\r\ncan hardly do so: in other words, there are characters which have\r\narisen through germinal selection, which are of purely 'morphological\r\nimportance.'\r\n\r\nIt has often been disputed whether there can be any such thing\r\nas 'purely morphological characters,' which are indifferent as\r\nfar as the existence of the species is concerned. This question\r\nused to be an important one, because the sphere of operation, and\r\ntherefore the importance of the Darwin-Wallace selection--personal\r\nselection--depends on the answer, since this mode of selection only\r\nbegins when a character has some biological importance. But as soon as\r\nwe take germinal selection into consideration the question loses its\r\nimportance, because we now know that every variation is indifferent\r\nto begin with, but every one can, under favourable circumstances,\r\nbe increased to such a pitch that it attains biological importance,\r\nand that personal selection then takes over the task of carrying it\r\non, either in a positive or a negative sense. We may therefore leave\r\nthis disputed point alone just now, for while germinal selection\r\nseems still far from being generally recognized, we have to remember\r\nthat we are not at all in a position to judge with any certainty as\r\nto the biological value of a character. What labour and painstaking\r\ninvestigation it has cost to give a verdict as to this even in a\r\nfew instances! Innumerable characters appear indifferent, and are\r\nnevertheless adaptations. Darwin in his day pointed out the need for\r\ncaution in this matter, referring to the case of animal coloration as\r\nan example; very little attention had been directed to it for a long\r\ntime because it had been believed to be without significance. And how\r\nmany diverse kinds of characters among animals and plants, which had\r\nlikewise been regarded as 'purely morphological,' have on more careful\r\ninvestigation shown themselves of very great biological importance.\r\nI need only refer to the shape, position, hair-arrangement, colour,\r\nand lustre of flowers, and their relation to cross-fertilization by\r\nmeans of insects, or to the thickness and shape of the leaves of\r\ntropical trees with their coating of wax and their gutter-like outlets\r\nfor carrying off the tropical rain which falls in terrible downpour\r\n(Haberlandt, Schimper), or to the limp, perpendicular drooping of the\r\ntufts of the young and tender leaves of the same trees, which also\r\nsecures protection from being battered and torn by the rain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107, _C._ Leptocephalus stage of an American Eel,\r\nwith seven pigment spots, of which three are on the left (_l_) and four\r\non the right (_r_) side. After Eigenmann.]\r\n\r\nThere are even characters the biological use of which is unknown to\r\nus, but in regard to which we can affirm that they have a use. Thus\r\nEigenmann described the larva of an American eel, which differs from\r\nother so-called 'Leptocephali' in that a row of seven black spots runs\r\nalong its side. Apparently all these lie upon the side turned towards\r\nus, but in reality they are distributed on both sides, three lying on\r\nthe left and four on the right, and so arranged that they look like a\r\nsingle row of spots at regular intervals, for the flat little fish is\r\nabsolutely transparent. The habits of this larva are not yet known, but\r\nwe may conclude that this appearance of a simple row of spots must have\r\nsome value for the animal, for such a significant asymmetry could not\r\nhave arisen for purely internal reasons (Fig. 107, _C_). It is possible\r\nthat the fish is thus made to resemble parts of some marine alga, and\r\nthat it is thereby protected from many enemies; that there is not a\r\ncomplete row upon each side may depend upon the fact that the two rows\r\nwould be visible at the same time, and that they would blur each other\r\nin the eyes of the swimming enemy, and so destroy the resemblance of\r\nthe picture to its unknown model.\r\n\r\nBut it cannot be denied that there are characters which have no special\r\nbiological significance. There are doubtless many such characters,\r\nwhich stand beyond the threshold of good or bad, and which are\r\ntherefore not affected by personal selection; it is difficult and often\r\nimpossible to point these out with certainty. The shape of the human\r\nnose and of the human ear, the colour of the hair and of the iris, may\r\nbe such indifferent characters whose peculiarities are to be referred\r\nsolely to germinal selection. On the other hand, I would not venture to\r\nassert that the gay colouring and the complex markings on the wings of\r\nour modern Lepidoptera are always and in all cases unimportant, even\r\nwhen we cannot interpret their details either as protective, or as a\r\nsign of nauseousness, or as mimetic. The usually very exact similarity\r\nof the colour pattern in the individuals of each species seems to point\r\nto the intervention of personal selection in some form or other, for in\r\nwhat other way could such a large majority of variations in the same\r\ndirection have developed in the germ-plasm as this constancy of the\r\ncharacter indicates.\r\n\r\nWe know, of course, that the colours of butterflies and moths can be\r\ncaused to vary through external and especially climatic influences,\r\nbut this would only account for simple modifications of colour, and\r\nnot for the origin of the complex colour patterns that actually\r\noccur. I therefore believe with Darwin that sexual selection has had\r\nmuch to do with this by giving a slight preference to the variations\r\nproduced by spontaneous germinal selection, and thus preventing the\r\nmajority of varied ids once acquired from being scattered again, but\r\nalways collecting more of them, and so securing free play for the\r\nincrease of the new character through intra-germinal processes. In\r\nthis way have arisen not only the brilliance of our Lycænidæ and of\r\nthe large Morphidæ of South America, but also many of the coloured\r\nspots, streaks, bands, eyes, and other components which have gradually\r\nin the course of time evolved into the complex colour pattern of\r\nmany of our modern butterflies. I should like to remind any one who\r\ndoubts this of a fact which corroborates the view that personal\r\nselection has co-operated in the production of these colours--I\r\nrefer to the inconspicuous colouring of the females of many of these\r\nbrilliant males--while in contradistinction to these cases there are\r\nother species in which both sexes are alike brilliant, so that it is\r\nimpossible that mere spontaneous germinal selection can have determined\r\nthat the females, because of their femaleness, should vary in a\r\ndifferent manner from the males.\r\n\r\nBut while I believe that sexual selection in particular has had much to\r\ndo with producing the colours of Lepidoptera, the basis of all these\r\ncolour variations must still be looked for in germinal selection, and\r\nwe shall see later on how it is possible to think of the diversified\r\nand often relatively abrupt transformations of marking as the resultant\r\nof the co-operation of climatic influences with germinal selection.\r\n\r\nOf course there must also be unimportant changes in butterfly-markings\r\nwhich depend solely on the internal play of forces in the determinant\r\nsystem, and to this must be referred the markings of many of the\r\n'variable' species whose variations are mere fluctuations in the\r\ndetails of marking, which have therefore caused much trouble to the\r\nsystematists. Truly unimportant variations will rarely or never\r\ncombine into a 'constant' form, and the fact that there are species\r\nwhich are 'variable' in such a high degree is enough to make us refer\r\ntheir variations to their lack of importance, for if they possessed\r\nany biological value the less valuable among them would gradually be\r\nremoved by selection. Perhaps the variable species of certain moths\r\nlike _Arctia caja_, and especially _Arctia plantaginis_, the little\r\n'bear' of the Alps and Apennines, must be reckoned among these.\r\nBut from the fact that there are such fluctuations in the markings\r\nof Lepidoptera, it seems to me that we must conclude that species\r\nwhich show a high degree of constancy in their markings have been\r\ninfluenced by selection, or by climatic influences which turned the\r\nplay of forces within the determinant system in the same direction in\r\nall individuals. All these considerations and conclusions are quite\r\nsound and serviceable theoretically, but they are difficult to apply\r\nto individual cases, and where this is attempted it must be with the\r\ngreatest caution, and, if possible, on a basis of investigations\r\nspecially undertaken for the purpose; for how should we know whether\r\na species which to-day is highly variable may not a geological\r\nepoch later become a very constant one? We must in any case assume\r\nthat marked fluctuations of characters are associated with many\r\ntransformations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXVI\r\n\r\nGERMINAL SELECTION (_continued_)\r\n\r\n Germinal selection, spontaneous and induced--Climatic\r\n forms of _Polyommatus phlæas_--Deformities--Excessive\r\n augmentation of variations--Can it lead to the elimination\r\n of a species?--Saltatory variations, copper-beech, weeping\r\n trees--Origin of sexual distinguishing characters--Formation\r\n of breeds among domesticated animals--Degenerate jaws--Human\r\n teeth--Short-sightedness--Milk-glands--Small hands and feet--Ascending\r\n variation--Talents, intellect--Combination of mental endowments--The\r\n ultimate roots of heritable variation--There are only plus- and\r\n minus-variations--Relations of the determinants to their\r\n determinates--The play of forces in the determinant system of the\r\n id--Germinal selection inhibited by personal selection--Objection on\r\n the score of the minuteness of the substance of the germ-plasm.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto we have derived the variations of the determinants of the\r\ngerm-plasm, upon which we based the process of germinal selection,\r\nfrom _chance local_ fluctuations in nutrition, such as must occur in\r\nan individual id, independently of the nutrition of the other ids of\r\nthe same germ-plasm. But there are doubtless also influences which set\r\nup similar nutritive changes in _all ids_, and by which, therefore,\r\nall homologous determinants, in as far as they are sensitive to the\r\nnutritive change in question, are affected in the same manner. To\r\nthis category belong changes in the external conditions of life, and\r\nparticularly climatic changes. It is, then, germinal selection alone\r\nwhich brings about the presence of a majority of ids with determinants\r\nvarying in the same direction, and personal selection has no part\r\nin the transformation of the species. Many years ago I instituted\r\nexperiments with a small butterfly, _Pararga egeria_, and these\r\nshowed that a heightened temperature so influenced the pupæ of this\r\nform that the butterflies emerged with a different and deeper yellow\r\nground-colour, similar to that of the long-known southern variety\r\n_Meione_. More thoroughly decisive, however, were the experiments on\r\n_Polyommatus phlæas_, the small 'fire-butterfly,' which were carried\r\non in the eighties by Merrifield in England and by myself almost at\r\nthe same time. I shall discuss these later in more detail, and will\r\nonly say here that this butterfly, whose range extends from Lapland\r\nto Sicily, occurs in two forms, the southern distinguished by a\r\n'dusting' of deep black from the northern, in which the wing-surfaces\r\nare of a pure red-gold. The experiments showed that the southern\r\nform can be artificially produced by warmth, and the interpretation\r\nmust be that the direct influence of higher temperature affects the\r\nquality of the nutritive fluids in the germ-plasm, and thereby at\r\nthe same time the determinants of one or more kinds of wing-scales\r\nare caused to vary in all the ids in the same direction, in such a\r\nfashion that they give rise to black scales instead of the former\r\nred-gold ones. It is thus certain that there are external influences\r\nwhich cause particular determinants to vary in a particular manner.\r\nI call this form of germinal variation 'induced' germinal selection,\r\nand contrast it with 'spontaneous' selection, which is caused, not by\r\nextra-germinal influences, but by the chances of the intra-germinal\r\nnutritive conditions, and which will, therefore, not readily occur at\r\nthe same time in all the ids of a germ-plasm, and so will not give rise\r\nto variation of the same kind in the homologous determinants of all the\r\nids.\r\n\r\nThe two processes must also be distinguished from each other in their\r\nrelation to personal selection, for induced germinal selection will\r\ngo on increasing until the maximum of variation corresponding to the\r\nnature of the external influences and of the determinants concerned\r\nis reached. Since _all_ the ids are equally affected and caused to\r\nvary in the same way, personal selection has nothing to take hold of,\r\nand the variation might go on intensifying even if it should become\r\nbiologically prejudicial. But it is quite otherwise with spontaneous\r\ngerminal selection, which has its roots not in all, but only in a\r\nmajority of the ids. Here the variation may go on increasing by\r\ngerminal selection alone, but only until it acquires a positive or\r\nnegative biological value, that is, until it becomes advantageous or\r\nprejudicial to the life of the individual; then personal selection\r\nintervenes and decides whether it is to go on increasing or not.\r\nSpontaneous germinal selection can therefore only lead to the general\r\nvariation of a whole species when it is supplemented by some external\r\nfactor such as, especially, the utility of the variation.\r\n\r\nThis does not imply, however, that indifferent variations of large\r\namount could not arise through spontaneous germinal selection, but\r\nthey would remain confined to a small number of individuals, and\r\nwould sooner or later disappear again. The congenital deformities of\r\nMan may in part fall under this category. If, for instance, certain\r\ndeterminants are, by reason of specially favourable local nutritive\r\nconditions, maintained for a long time in progressive variation, they\r\nwill become so strong that the part which they determine will turn\r\nout excessive, perhaps double. Hereditary polydactylism in Man may\r\nperhaps be explained on this principle, and I had already referred\r\nit to the more rapid growth and duplication of certain determinants\r\nof the germ even before formulating the idea of germinal selection.\r\nIn this I was at one with the pathologist Ernst Ziegler, who had\r\ndesignated polydactylism as a germ-variation, and in contrast to\r\nothers had not interpreted it in an atavistic sense, as a reversion to\r\nunknown six-fingered ancestors. All excessive or defective hereditary\r\nmalformations may be referred to germinal selection alone, that is, to\r\nthe long-continued progressive or regressive variation of particular\r\ndeterminant-groups in a majority of ids.\r\n\r\nThe fact that, as far as our experience goes, superfluous fingers\r\nare never inherited for more than five generations may be simply\r\nexplained, for there has been no reason for the intervention of\r\npersonal selection, either in the negative sense, for the six-fingered\r\nstate does not threaten life, nor in the positive, since it is not of\r\nadvantage. The deformity depends on spontaneous germinal variation,\r\nwhich must have taken place in a majority of ids or it would not\r\nhave become manifest. But such a majority of 'polydactylous' ids is\r\nliable to become scattered again in every new descendant, and to be\r\nreduced again into a minority which can no longer make itself felt by\r\nthe chances of reducing division and the admixture of normal ids in\r\namphimixis. A polydactylous race of men could only arise through the\r\nassistance of personal selection; in that case there would doubtless\r\nbe just as much chance of success in breeding a six-fingered race as\r\nthere was in breeding the crooked-legged Ancon sheep from a single ram\r\nwhich was malformed in this manner. Without a gradual setting aside of\r\nthe germs with normal ids, that is, without personal selection, such\r\nspontaneous deformities, and indeed all _spontaneous_ variations, must\r\nfail of attaining to permanent mastery.\r\n\r\nThis must frequently be the case in free nature also, but we shall have\r\nto investigate later on, in the section devoted to the formation of\r\nspecies, whether external circumstances (inbreeding) may not also occur\r\nwhich make it possible for spontaneous variations to become constant\r\nbreed-characters, even although they remain neither good nor bad, and\r\nare thus not subject to the action of personal selection.\r\n\r\nIn general, however, amphigony with its reduction of the ids and its\r\nconstant mingling of strange ids will form the corrective to the\r\ndeviations which may arise through the processes of selection within\r\nthe id, and which lead to excessive or superfluous development of\r\ncertain structures, to a complete disturbance of the harmony of the\r\nparts, and ultimately to the elimination of the species.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that Emery was probably right when he\r\ndirected attention to the possibility of a 'conflict between germinal\r\nand personal selection.' It is quite conceivable that in cases of\r\nuseful variations, that is, of adaptations, the processes of selection\r\nwithin the germ-plasm may lead to excessive developments, which\r\npersonal selection cannot control, because, on account of their earlier\r\nusefulness, they have in the course of a series of generations and\r\nspecies become fixed not only in a majority of ids, but in almost all\r\nthe ids of the collective germ-plasm of the species. In this case a\r\nreversal must be difficult and slow, for the gathering together of ids\r\nwith relatively weaker determinants can only take place slowly, and\r\nit is questionable whether the species would survive long enough for\r\nthe slow process to take effect. But, apart from the question of time,\r\nsuch a reduction of an excessive development would sometimes be quite\r\nimpossible, for the simple reason that there is nothing for personal\r\nselection to take hold of.\r\n\r\nDöderlein has pointed out that many characters go on increasing through\r\nwhole series of extinct species, and ultimately grow to such excess\r\nthat they bring about the destruction of the species, as, for instance,\r\nthe antlers of the giant stag or the sabre-like teeth of certain\r\ncarnivores in the diluvial period. I shall have to discuss this in more\r\ndetail in speaking of the extinction of species; it is enough to say\r\nhere that such long-continued augmentations in the same direction can\r\nnever be referred _solely_ to germinal selection, since it is hardly\r\nconceivable that a species--much less a whole series of species--should\r\narise with injurious characters; they would have become extinct while\r\nthey were still in process of arising. Although we see that the\r\nIrish stag, with his enormous antlers over ten feet across from tip\r\nto tip, was heavily burdened, we are hardly justified in concluding\r\nthat the size and weight of the burden on his head tended to his\r\ndestruction from the first--for in that case the species would never\r\nhave developed at all--but it may well be that at some time or other\r\nthe life-conditions of the species altered in such a manner that the\r\nheavy antlers became fatal to it. In this case the variation-direction\r\nwhich had gained the mastery in all ids could no longer be sufficiently\r\nheld in check by personal selection, because the variations in the\r\ncontrary direction would be much too slight to attain to selective\r\nvalue. Sudden, or at least rapidly occurring changes in the conditions\r\nof life, such as the appearance of a powerful enemy, exclude all chance\r\nof adaptation by the slow operation of personal selection.\r\n\r\nIf we look into the matter more carefully, we see that it is not\r\nstrictly true to say that germinal selection alone brings about the\r\nextinction of a species by cumulative augmentation of structures which\r\nare already excessive; _it is the incapacity of personal selection\r\nto keep pace with the more rapid changes in the conditions of life\r\nand to reduce excessive developments to any considerable extent in a\r\nshort time_. This would always be possible in a long time, for the\r\ndeterminants of the excessive organ _E_ can never be equally strong in\r\nall the ids; they always fluctuate about a mean, however high this mean\r\nmay be. Here again it must still be possible that reducing-divisions\r\nand amphimixis may lead to the formation of majorities of ids with\r\nweaker _E_-determinants, and if sufficient time be allowed, artificial\r\nselection could, by consistently selecting the individuals with, let\r\nus say, weaker antlers, give rise to a descending variation-movement.\r\nThere are no variation-movements which cannot be checked; every\r\ndirection can be reversed, but time and something to take hold of\r\nmust be granted. That was wanting in the case of the giant stag, for\r\nit would not have been saved even if its antlers had at once become a\r\ncouple of feet shorter, and germinal selection can hardly make so much\r\ndifference as that.\r\n\r\nAnalogous to hereditary deformities, and of special interest in\r\nconnexion with the processes within the germ-plasm, are '_sports_'\r\nvariations of considerable magnitude which suddenly appear without our\r\nbeing able to see any definite external reason for them. I have already\r\ndiscussed these in detail in my _Germ-plasm_, and have shown how simply\r\nthese apparently capricious phenomena of heredity can be understood _in\r\nprinciple_ from the standpoint of the germ-plasm theory.\r\n\r\nThe chances of the transmission of the saltatory variation will be\r\ngreater or less according to whether the variation of the relevant\r\ndeterminants involves a bare majority of ids or a large majority, for\r\nthe more ids that have varied, the greater is the probability that the\r\nmajority will be maintained throughout the course of ensuing reducing\r\ndivisions and amphimixis, that is, that the seeds of the plant will\r\nreproduce the variation, and will not revert to the ancestral form.\r\nAlthough one of the most satisfactory results of the id-theory lies\r\nprecisely in the interpretation of these conditions, I do not wish\r\nto enter into the matter here, but will refer to the details in my\r\n_Germ-plasm_, published in 1894, which I consider valid still. At that\r\ntime I had not formulated the idea of germinal selection, but the\r\nexplanation of the occurrence of such sport-variations which I gave was\r\nbased upon the assumption of nutritive fluctuations in the germ-plasm,\r\nwhich gave rise to variations in certain determinants. There was still\r\nlacking the recognition that the direction of variation once taken must\r\nbe adhered to until resistance was met with, and that the determinants\r\nstand in nutritive correlation with one another, so that changes in\r\none determinant must re-act upon the neighbouring ones, as I shall\r\nexplain more fully afterwards. I also showed from definite cases that\r\nsuch sports, though they are sudden--'saltatory'--in their mode of\r\noccurrence, are long being prepared for by intimate processes in the\r\ngerm-plasm. This 'invisible prelude' of variation depends on germinal\r\nselection. When a wild plant is sown in garden-ground it does not\r\nrequire to vary at once; several, even many, generations may succeed\r\neach other which show no sports; suddenly, however, sports appear,\r\nat first singly, then, perhaps, in considerable numbers. It is not,\r\nhowever, by any means always the case that considerable numbers occur,\r\nfor some varieties of our garden flowers have arisen only once, and\r\nthen have been propagated by seed; and such saltatory sports in plants\r\nwhich are raised from seed are usually constant in their seed, and if\r\nthey are fertilized with their own pollen they breed true--a proof that\r\nthe same variations must have taken place in the relevant determinants\r\nin a large majority of ids.\r\n\r\nIn animals, it would appear, such saltatory variations occur much more\r\nrarely than in plants; the case examined in detail by Darwin of the\r\n'black-shouldered peacock' which suddenly appeared in a poultry-yard is\r\nan example of this kind. Much more numerous, however, are the instances\r\namong plants, and especially among plants which are under cultivation.\r\nThis indicates that we have here to do with the effect of external\r\nconditions, of nutritive influences which cause the slow variation of\r\ncertain determinants, sometimes abetting and sometimes checking. As\r\nsoon as a majority of ids varied in this way comes to lie in a seed, a\r\nsport springs up suddenly and apparently discontinuously--a plant with\r\ndifferently coloured or shaped petals or leaves, with double flowers,\r\nwith degenerate stamens, or with some other distinguishing mark, and\r\nthese new characters persist if the variety is propagated without\r\ninter-crossing.\r\n\r\nBut it happens sometimes, though more rarely, that not the whole\r\nplant but individual shoots may exhibit the variation. To this class\r\nbelong the 'bud-variations' of our forest trees, the copper-beeches,\r\ncopper-oaks, and copper-hazels, the various fasciated varieties of oak,\r\nbeech, maple, and birch, and the 'weeping trees'; also the numerous\r\nvarieties of potato, plantain, and sugar-cane. It seems that only a\r\nfew of these breed true when reproduced from seed, or in other words,\r\nthey usually exhibit reversions to the ancestral form: on the other\r\nhand, in the weeping oak for instance, nearly all the seedlings exhibit\r\nthe character of the new variety, though 'in varying degrees.' The\r\nrecords as to the transmissibility of bud-variations through seed are\r\nprobably not all to be relied upon, and new investigations are much\r\nto be desired, but the fact that in many cases they may be propagated\r\nnot only by means of layers and cuttings but by seed also, is most\r\nimportant in our present discussion, for it proves that here too the\r\nvaried determinants must be contained in a majority of ids. As it\r\nis only a single shoot that exhibits the saltatory variation, only\r\nthe germ-plasm which was contained in the cells of this one shoot\r\ncan have varied, and it must have done so in so many ids that the\r\nvariation prevailed and found expression. But that, in this case also,\r\nthe variation does not appear in all, but only in a small majority\r\nof ids, is proved by the frequent reversion of bud-varieties to the\r\nancestral form. I have already reported a case of this kind shown to\r\nme by Professor Strasburger in the Botanic Gardens in Bonn, where a\r\nhornbeam with deeply indented 'oak-leaves' had one branch which bore\r\nquite normal hornbeam leaves. In my own garden there is an oak shrub\r\nof the 'fern-leaved' variety, whose branches bear some leaves of the\r\nordinary form; variegated maples with almost white leaves often exhibit\r\nin individual branches a reversion to the fresh green leaves of the\r\nancestral form. We see from this that what is so energetically disputed\r\nby many must in reality occur--namely, differential or non-equivalent\r\nnuclear division--for otherwise it would be unintelligible how\r\nthe ids of the new variety, if they once attain a majority in the\r\ntree, could give place in an individual branch to a majority of the\r\nancestral ids. Only differential nuclear division, in the manner of a\r\nreducing division, can be the cause of this. Of course this implies\r\nonly a dissimilar or differential distribution of the ids between the\r\ntwo daughter-nuclei, not a splitting up of the individual ids into\r\nnon-equivalents.\r\n\r\nThat in free Nature bud-variations left to themselves can ever become\r\npermanent varieties is probably an unlikely assumption, because of the\r\ninconstancy of their seeds which only breed true in rare cases; nor\r\nis it likely that such variations as the copper-beech, the weeping\r\nash, and so on could hold their own in the struggle for existence\r\nwith the older species; but there is certainly nothing to prevent our\r\nassuming that, in certain circumstances, saltatory variations, when\r\nthey have a germinal origin, may become persistent varieties and may\r\neven lead to a splitting of the species. This may happen, for instance,\r\nwhen the variations remain outside the limits of good and bad, and\r\nthus are neither of advantage to the existence of the species nor a\r\ndrawback thereto. In the next chapter we shall discuss the influence of\r\nisolation upon the formation of species, and it will be seen that in\r\ncertain conditions even indifferent variations may be preserved, and\r\nthat saltatory variations, as for instance in the evolution of species\r\nof land-snails or butterflies, may have materially contributed to bring\r\nthis about.\r\n\r\nI should like to emphasize still more the part played by saltatory\r\nvariations arising from germinal selection in the origin of secondary\r\nsexual characters. As soon as personal selection, whether sexual\r\nor ordinary, prefers as useful in any sense a saltatory variation,\r\nit is not only preserved and becomes a character of a variety, but\r\nit may increase, and we have to ask whether such sudden variations\r\nare frequently of a useful kind, especially when not individual\r\ncharacters alone, but whole combinations of them are implicated. If\r\nwe may judge from the sports of the flowers and the leaves of plants,\r\ntransformations useful to the species as a whole rarely occur suddenly,\r\nthat is, they occur only in a few out of very numerous sports; they\r\nare much more frequently indifferent, although quite visible and often\r\nconspicuous variations.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I am disposed to attribute to saltatory variations a\r\nconsiderable share in the production of distinctive sexual characters.\r\nFrom saltatory variations in flowers, fruits, and leaves we know that\r\nthese may be conspicuous enough even on their first appearance, and so\r\nwe are justified in finding in such variations the first beginnings of\r\nmany of the decorative distinguishing characters which occur in the\r\nmales of so many animals, especially butterflies and birds. As soon as\r\nit is admitted that variations of considerable amount, which have been\r\nslowly prepared in the germ-plasm by means of germinal selection, can\r\nsuddenly attain to expression, one of the objections against sexual\r\nselection is disposed of, for conspicuous variations are necessary for\r\nthe operation of this kind of selection, since the changes in question\r\nmust attract the attention of the females if they are to be preferred.\r\nWithout such preference, even though it be not quite strict and\r\nconsistent, a long-continued augmentation of the decorative characters\r\nis inconceivable.\r\n\r\nBut as intra-germinal disturbances of the position of equilibrium in\r\nthe determinant system is at the root of the saltatory variations of\r\nour cultivated plants, it must also have played a large share in the\r\nevolution of breeds among our domesticated animals, which is therefore\r\nby no means wholly due to artificial selection operating upon the\r\nvariation of individual characters. In all breeds in the formation of\r\nwhich the production of more than a single definite character was\r\nconcerned, as, for instance, in the broad-nosed breeds of dog--bull-dog\r\nand pug-dog--we may refer the peculiar variation of many parts to\r\ndisturbances of the equilibrium of the determinant system, which bring\r\nto light, not suddenly as in the case of saltatory variations, but\r\ngradually and increasingly, the curious complex of characters. Darwin\r\nreferred such transformations of the whole animal facies, where a\r\nsingle varying character is deliberately selected, to correlation, and\r\nby this he understood the mutual influence of the parts of an animal\r\nupon one another. Such correlation certainly exists, as we have already\r\nseen in discussing histonal selection, but here we have rather to do\r\nwith the correlation of the parts of the germ-plasm, with the effects\r\nof germinal selection, which, affected by the artificial selection of\r\nparticular characters, gradually brings about a more marked disturbance\r\nin the whole determinant system.\r\n\r\nIn the evolution of our breeds of domesticated animals, germinal\r\nselection in the negative sense must also have played a part--I mean\r\nthrough the weakening and degeneration of individual determinants.\r\nOnly in this way, it seems to me, can we explain the tameness of our\r\ndomestic animals, dogs, cats, horses, &c., in which all the instincts\r\nof wildness, fleeing from Man, the inclination to bite, and to attack,\r\nhave at least partly disappeared. It is, of course, very difficult to\r\nestimate how much of this is to be ascribed to acquired habitude during\r\nthe individual lifetime. The case of the elephant might be cited in\r\nevidence of tameness which arises in the individual lifetime, for all\r\ntame elephants are caught wild, but it seems that captured young beasts\r\nof prey, such as the fox, wolf, and wild cat, not to speak of lions and\r\ntigers, never attain to the degree of tameness exhibited by many of our\r\ndomesticated dogs and cats. The very considerable differences in the\r\ndegree of tameness of dogs and cats go to show that the case is one of\r\ninstincts varying in different degree.\r\n\r\nIf this be so, then the instinct of wildness, if I may express myself\r\nso for the sake of brevity, has degenerated in consequence of its\r\nsuperfluity, and through the process of germinal selection, which\r\nallowed the determinants of the brain-parts concerned to set out on a\r\npath of downward variation upon which they met with no resistance on\r\nthe part of personal selection.\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer adduced against my position the case of the reduction\r\nin the size of the jaws in many breeds of dog, especially in pugs and\r\nother lap-dogs, which he regarded as evidence of the inheritance of\r\nacquired characters. But this and analogous cases of the degeneration\r\nof an organ during a long period in which the animal had been withdrawn\r\nfrom the conditions of natural life is intelligible enough on the\r\nassumption of persistent germinal selection aided by panmixia. The jaws\r\nand teeth in these spoilt pets no longer require to be maintained at\r\nthe level of strength and sharpness essential to their ancestors which\r\ndepended on these characters, and so they fell below it, became smaller\r\nand weaker, but could not disappear altogether, for the process of\r\ndegeneration was brought, or is being brought, to a standstill by the\r\nintervention of personal selection.\r\n\r\nEven the lower jaw in Man is declared by many authors to be degenerate.\r\nCollins found that the lower jaw of the modern Englishman was one-ninth\r\nsmaller than that of the ancient Briton, and one-half smaller than that\r\nof the Australians; Flower showed that we are a microdont race like\r\nthe Egyptians, while the Chinese, Indians, Malays, and Negroes are\r\nmesodont, and the Andamanese, Melanese, Australians, and Tasmanians are\r\nmacrodont. This does not of itself imply that we exhibit a degeneration\r\nof dentition, though this conclusion is hinted at by other facts,\r\nsuch as the variability of the wisdom-teeth. It need not surprise us,\r\nindeed, that a retrogressive variation tendency should have started\r\nin this case, for, with higher culture and more refined methods of\r\neating, the claims which personal selection was obliged to make on the\r\ndentition have been greatly diminished, and germinal selection would\r\nthus intervene.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows how the quality of human teeth has deteriorated with\r\nculture, and this not in the higher classes only, but even among the\r\npeasantry, as Ammon has observed. The time is past when raw flesh\r\nwas a dainty, and when bad teeth meant poor nutrition, if not actual\r\nstarvation. Even nowadays famine plays a terrible and periodically\r\nrecurrent rôle as an eliminator among some negroid races.\r\n\r\nMany other organs in man have been reduced from their former pitch of\r\nperfection through culture, and some of them are still in process of\r\ndwindling. When I formulated the idea of panmixia and applied it to\r\nexplain cases which had previously been referred to the inheritance of\r\nthe results of disuse, I regarded the short-sightedness of civilized\r\nMan from this point of view. My opinion aroused lively opposition at\r\nthe time, especially on the part of oculists, who very emphatically\r\nreferred the phenomenon to the inheritance of acquired shortsight,\r\nand indeed regarded it as a proof of the transmission of functional\r\nmodifications.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from the fact that the assumption of this mode of\r\ninheritance must now be regarded not only as unproved, but as\r\ncontradicted by reliable data, panmixia, in conjunction with\r\nthe ceaseless fluctuations within the germ-plasm--germinal\r\nselection--affords a better explanation than the other theory was ever\r\nin a position to offer. At that time I pointed out that the survival\r\nof the individual among civilized races had not for a very long time\r\ndepended on the perfection of his eyesight, as it does for instance\r\nin the case of a hunting or warlike Indian, or of a beast of prey,\r\nor of a herbivore persecuted by the beast of prey. And this is by no\r\nmeans due solely to the invention of spectacles, but in a much greater\r\ndegree to the fact that every man no longer has to do everything, so\r\nthat numerous possibilities of gaining a livelihood remain open to the\r\nless sharp-sighted; that is, the division of labour in human society\r\nhas made the survival of the short-sighted quite feasible. As soon as\r\nthis division of labour reached such a degree that the founding of a\r\nfamily offered no greater difficulty to the short-sighted individual\r\nthan to one with normal sight, short-sightedness could no longer be\r\neliminated; and partly because of the mingling with normal sight, but\r\npartly also because of the never-failing minus-fluctuations of the\r\ngerm-plasm determinants concerned, a variation in a downward direction\r\nwas bound to set in, and will continue until a limit is set to it by\r\npersonal selection. Meantime, we are obviously still in the midst of\r\nthe process of eye-deterioration; and the resistance to it is somewhat\r\ninhibited in its operation, because although individuals with extremely\r\nbad sight are for the most part hindered from gaining an independent\r\nlivelihood and having a family, this is certainly, thanks to our\r\nmistaken humanity, not always the case. There are even instances of\r\nmarriage between two blind persons!\r\n\r\nAs yet, however, the deterioration of eyes has not advanced very far;\r\nnot nearly all families are affected by it, and even in Germany,\r\nthe land of the 'longest school form' and of the greatest number\r\nof spectacle-wearers, short-sight is still usually acquired by\r\nindividuals, although there must frequently be a more or less marked\r\npredisposition to it. It is a common objection to this view that in\r\nEngland, France, and Italy the percentage of short-sighted individuals\r\nis much lower, and, in point of fact, one sees far fewer people wearing\r\nspectacles in those countries. This, however, does not prove that a\r\nsimilar deterioration of eyes has not begun there also, for how could\r\nthe small inherited beginnings be detected if they were not accentuated\r\nby the spoiling of the eyesight in the lifetime of the individual by\r\nmuch reading of bad print, and by writing with bent head, as is still\r\ntoo often the case in many German schools.\r\n\r\nThat our interpretation, through panmixia on a basis of germinal\r\nselection, is the correct one, we infer also from the fact that\r\nshort-sightedness has been proved to be a frequent character even among\r\nour domesticated animals, such as the dog and the horse. These animals\r\nreceive protection and maintenance from Man, and their survival and\r\nreproduction no longer depend on the acuteness of their sight, and\r\nthus the eye has fallen from its original perfection, just as in Man,\r\nalthough in this case reading and writing play no part.\r\n\r\nA whole series of similar slight deteriorations of individual organs\r\nand systems of organs might be enumerated, all of which have appeared\r\nin consequence of long and intensive culture in Man. All these must\r\ndepend upon germinal selection, on a gradually progressive weakening\r\nof the determinant-groups concerned, under the conditions of panmixia,\r\nthat is, in the absence of positive selection.\r\n\r\nTo these must be added the deterioration of the mammary-glands and\r\nbreasts, and the inability to suckle the offspring which results\r\nchiefly from this. Here we have a variational tendency which could not\r\nappear in a people at a lower stage of culture, and it has not become\r\ngeneral in the lower classes of society among ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe muscular weakness of the higher classes is another case in point,\r\nand all gymnastics and sports will be of no avail as long as a relative\r\nweakness of the muscles is not a hindrance to gaining a livelihood, and\r\nhaving a family. Even universal conscription will do nothing to check\r\nthis falling off of the bodily strength. Certainly military service\r\nstrengthens thousands, and hundreds of thousands of individuals, but it\r\ndoes not prevent the weaklings from multiplying, and thus reproducing\r\nthe race-deterioration. But it would indeed be well if only those who\r\nhad gone through a term of military service were allowed to beget\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nIt is only among the peasantry, inasmuch as they really work and\r\ndo not merely look on as proprietors of the ground, that such a\r\ndeterioration of the general muscular strength could not become the\r\npermanent variational tendency of the determinants concerned, because\r\namong genuine peasants bodily strength is a condition of having and\r\nsupporting a family--at least on an average.\r\n\r\nThe diminution in the firmness and thickness of the bones in the\r\nhigher classes, and many another mark of civilization, must be looked\r\nat from the point of view of panmixia and germinal selection; perhaps\r\nalso the smaller hands and feet which frequently occur along with a\r\nmore graceful general build in the higher ranks of European peoples.\r\nIt would certainly not be surprising if in families which usually\r\nintermarry, and which in no way depend for their material subsistence\r\non the possession of large and powerful hands and feet or bones\r\ngenerally, a downward variation of the relevant germ-determinants\r\nshould have developed, but this could never overstep a certain limit,\r\nbecause it would then be prejudicial even in civilized life. That we\r\nmust be very careful not to regard large hands and feet as the direct\r\nresult of hard physical toil was brought home to me by an observation\r\nof Strasburger's. He was particularly struck by the fact that the\r\npeasants of the high Tatra (Carpathians) were distinguished by the\r\nsmallness of their hands and feet.\r\n\r\nBut while civilization has excited numerous downward variations in the\r\ngerm, it has, on the other hand, been the cause of numerous hereditary\r\nimprovements--variations in an upward direction. This opens up new\r\nground, for hitherto we have been confronted with the alternative of\r\neither accepting the inheritance of acquired characters, and on this\r\nbasis referring the talents and mental endowments of civilized Man to\r\nexercise continued throughout many generations, or of admitting an\r\nincrease of mental powers only in as far as they possess 'selection\r\nvalue,' that is, as they may be decisive in the struggle for existence.\r\nTo these mental qualities belong cleverness and ingenuity in all\r\ndirections, courage, endurance, power of combination, inventive power,\r\nwith its roots in imagination and fertility of ideas, as well as desire\r\nfor achievement, and industry. Throughout the long history of human\r\ncivilization these mental qualities must have increased through the\r\nstruggle for existence, but how have the specific talents such as those\r\nexhibited in music, painting, and mathematics come into existence?\r\nAnd how have the moral virtues of civilized Man been evolved, and\r\nparticularly unselfishness? For it can hardly be maintained of any of\r\nthese endowments that they possess selection-value for the individual.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to discuss these questions in detail; they are\r\ntoo many-sided and of too much importance to be treated of merely in\r\npassing; moreover, I gave expression years ago to my views on this\r\nsubject by dealing with one example--the musical sense in Man. I do\r\nnot believe that the musical sense had its beginnings in Man, or that\r\nit has materially increased since the days of primitive Man, but in\r\nconjunction with the higher psychical life of civilized peoples its\r\nexpressions and applications have risen to a higher level. It is, so to\r\nspeak, an instrument which has been transmitted to us from our animal\r\nancestors, and on which we have learnt to play better the more our mind\r\nhas developed; it is an unintended 'accessory effect' of the extremely\r\nfine and highly developed organs of hearing with their nerve-centres\r\nwhich our animal ancestors acquired in the struggle for existence, and\r\nwhich played a much more important rôle in the preservation of life in\r\ntheir case than it does in ours. The musical sense may be compared to\r\nthe hand, which was developed even among the apes, but which civilized\r\nMan in modern times no longer uses merely to perform its original\r\nfunction, grasping, but also for many other purposes, such as writing\r\nand playing the piano. And just as the hand did not originate through\r\nthe necessities of the piano, neither did the extremely delicate sense\r\nof hearing of the higher animals develop for the sake of music, but\r\nrather that they might recognize their enemies, friends, and prey, in\r\ndarkness and mist, in the forest, on the heath, and at great distances.\r\n\r\nThe case is probably the same with the rest of the special psychical\r\nendowments or talents. I do not of course maintain that they, like\r\nthe musical sense, did not at some time play a rôle in the struggle\r\nfor existence and survival, and therefore could not increase, but\r\nthe increase was certainly not continuous, but much interrupted,\r\nso that it would extend only to small groups of descendants, and\r\ntherefore could only contribute very slowly to the elevation of the\r\npsychic capacities of a whole people. But in certain individuals\r\nand families such augmentations would certainly take place through\r\ngerminal selection, and it seems to me probable that these would never\r\nbe wholly lost again, even if they appeared to be so, but would be\r\nhanded on, in id-minorities, through the chain of generations, and\r\nwould slightly raise the average of the talent in question, and might\r\neven, under favourable circumstances, combine in the development of\r\na genius. We know how strongly hereditary such specific talents are;\r\nlet us suppose that the determinants of, say, the musical sense have,\r\nby the intra-germinal chances of nutrition, been started on a path of\r\nascending variation; they will continue in this path until a halt is\r\ncalled from some quarter or other. This can only happen if, in the\r\nreducing division, or in amphimixis, the highly developed musical\r\ndeterminants are wholly or partly eliminated, or are reduced to a\r\nminority. As long as this does not happen the ascending variation will\r\ngo on, and then we may have the birth of a Mozart or of a Beethoven.\r\nPersonal selection will not interfere either in a positive or a\r\nnegative sense, since high development of the musical sense has no\r\neffect either in advancing or retarding the struggle for existence;\r\nthe increase will therefore go on until the large majority of highly\r\ndeveloped musical determinants, which we must assume in the case of\r\na musical genius, is reduced, or even transformed into a minority,\r\nthrough unfavourable reducing divisions of the germ-cells, and by\r\nassociation with the germ-cells of less musical mates.\r\n\r\nThe fact that highly developed specific talents have never been known\r\nto be inherited through more than seven generations is quite in keeping\r\nwith this view. But even this persistence has been observed only in\r\nthe case of musical talent, and the long continuance of the inherited\r\ntalent may well be due, as Francis Galton suggests in his famous\r\nstatistical investigations into the phenomena of inheritance, to the\r\nfact that musical men do not readily choose wives who are absolutely\r\nlacking in this talent. It would be easy to rear an exceedingly\r\nhighly gifted musical group of families within the German nation, if\r\nwe could secure that only the highly-gifted musically should unite\r\nin marriage--that is, if personal selection could play its part. In\r\nanother more general domain of mental endowment a case of this kind\r\nhas been recorded, for Galton tells us of three highly gifted English\r\nfamilies which intermarried for ten generations, and in that time\r\nscarcely produced a descendant who did not deserve to be called a\r\ndistinguished man in some direction or other.\r\n\r\nOf course, such continued persistence, through a long series of\r\ngenerations, of a high general mental level is more possible than the\r\ntransmission and increase of a specific talent, for in the former case\r\nit is a question of a mixture of different high mental endowments,\r\nof which not all need be developed in every individual, and yet the\r\nindividual need not fall to mediocrity if he possesses a combination\r\nof other qualities. But in musical talent, on the other hand, the\r\nfalling from the height once attained takes place as soon as this one\r\ncharacter is no longer represented in a sufficiently strong majority\r\nof determinants. Of course it would be a mistake to believe that the\r\ntalent of a Sebastian Bach or a Beethoven depended solely on the\r\nhighly developed musical sense; in them, as in all great artists, many\r\nhighly developed mental qualities must have combined with the musical\r\nsense; a simpleton could never have written the Mass in B minor or the\r\nPassion of St. Matthew even if he had possessed the musical genius of\r\nSebastian Bach. In this fact lies a further reason why genius is seldom\r\nfound at the same pitch in two successive generations; the combination\r\nof mental characters always varies from father to son, and slight\r\ndisplacements may give rise to very great differences in relation to\r\nthe manifestations of the specific talent. Under certain circumstances,\r\nthe weak development of a single trait of character, as, for instance,\r\npower of action, or the excessive development of another, such as\r\nindecision or desultoriness, may so nullify the existing favourable\r\ncombinations of mental characters, such as, let us say, musical sense,\r\ninventive talent, depth of feeling, &c., that they bear no fruit\r\nworth mentioning. And since as we have already seen, the different\r\nmental qualities of the parents are to a certain extent separately\r\ntransmitted, that is, since they may appear in the children in the most\r\ndiverse combinations, we should rather be surprised that pronounced\r\ntalent in a specific direction can persist in a family for two and a\r\nhalf centuries than that it should do so very rarely. For reducing\r\ndivision is always combining the existing mental qualities anew, and\r\namphimixis is adding fresh ones to them.\r\n\r\nThus germinal selection, that is, the free, spontaneous, but definitely\r\ndirected variation of individual groups of determinants, is at the\r\nroot of those striking individual peculiarities which we call specific\r\ntalents; but it can attain to the highest level only rarely and in\r\nisolated cases, because these talents are not favoured by personal\r\nselection, and therefore the excessively highly developed determinants\r\nupon which they depend may be dispersed in the course of generations;\r\nthey may sink to smaller majorities, or even to minorities, in which\r\ncase they will no longer manifest themselves in visible mental\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nWe deduced the process of germinal selection on the basis of the\r\nassumption that the nutrition of all the parts and particles of\r\nthe body, therefore also of the determinants and biophors of the\r\ngerm-plasm, is subject to fluctuations. We regarded the resulting\r\nvariations of these last and smallest units of the germ-plasm as the\r\nultimate source of all hereditary variation, and therefore the basis of\r\nall the transformations which the organic world has undergone in the\r\ncourse of ages and is undergoing still.\r\n\r\nWe have still to inquire whether we can give any more precise account\r\nof the nature of these units of the germ-plasm. If I mistake not,\r\nwe may say at least so much, that all variations are, in ultimate\r\ninstance, quantitative, and that they depend on the increase or\r\ndecrease of the vital particles, or their constituents, the molecules.\r\nFor this reason I have hitherto always spoken of only two directions\r\nof variation--a plus or a minus direction from the average. What\r\nappears to us a qualitative variation is, in reality, nothing more\r\nthan a greater or a less, a different mingling of the constituents\r\nwhich make up a higher unit, an unequal increase or decrease of these\r\nconstituents, the lower units. We speak of the simple growth of a cell\r\nwhen its mass increases without any alteration in its composition,\r\nthat is, when the proportion of the component parts and chemical\r\ncombinations remains unchanged; but the cell changes its _constitution_\r\nwhen this proportion is disturbed, when, for instance, the red\r\npigment-granules which were formerly present but scarcely visible\r\nincrease so that the cell looks red. If there had previously been no\r\nred granules present, they might have arisen through the breaking up\r\nof certain other particles--of protoplasm, for instance, in the course\r\nof metabolism, so that, among other substances, red granules of uric\r\nacid or some other red stuff were produced. In this case also the\r\nqualitative change would depend on an increase or decrease of certain\r\nsimpler molecules and atoms constituting the protoplasm-molecule. Thus,\r\nin ultimate instance, all variations depend upon quantitative changes\r\nof the constituents of which the varying part is composed.\r\n\r\nIt might be objected to this argument that chemistry has made us\r\nacquainted with isomeric combinations whose qualitative differences\r\ndo not depend upon a different _number_ of the molecules composing\r\nthem, but upon their different arrangement; it might be supposed that\r\nsomething similar would occur also in morphological relations. And, in\r\npoint of fact, this seems to be the case. We may, for instance, imagine\r\none hundred hairs as being at one time equally distributed on the back\r\nof a beetle, and at another standing close together and forming a kind\r\nof brush, but although this brush would be a new character of the\r\nbeetle, yet its development would depend upon quantitative differences,\r\nnamely, on the fact that the same skin-area, which in the first case\r\nbore perhaps only one hair, had in the second case a hundred. The\r\nquantity of hair cells has notably increased upon this small area. In\r\nthe same way the characteristic striping of the zebra depends not on\r\na qualitative change in the skin as a whole, but upon an increased\r\ndeposit of black pigment in particular cells of the skin, therefore\r\non a quantitative change. In relation to the whole animal it is a\r\nqualitative variation, as contrasted, for instance, with the horse, but\r\nin respect of the constituent parts which give rise to the qualitative\r\nvariation it is purely quantitative. The character of the whole edifice\r\nis changed when the proportion of the stones of which it consists are\r\naltered.\r\n\r\nThus the determinants of the germ may not only become larger or smaller\r\nas a whole, but some kinds of the biophors of which they are made up\r\nmay increase more than others, under definite altered conditions, and\r\nin that case the determinants themselves will vary qualitatively, so\r\nthat, from the changing numerical proportions of the different kinds of\r\nbiophors, a variation of the characters of the determinants can arise,\r\nand consequently also qualitative variations of the organs controlled\r\nby the determinants--the determinates. But, since nothing living can\r\nbe thought of as invariable, the biophors themselves may, on account\r\nof nutritive fluctuations, grow unequally, and thereby vary in their\r\nqualities. To follow this out in greater detail and attempt to guess\r\nat the play of forces within the minutest life-complexes would at\r\npresent only be giving the rein to imagination, but in principle no\r\nobjection can be made to the assumption that every element of life down\r\nto the very lowest and smallest can, by reason of inequalities in its\r\nnutrition, be not only started on an ascending or descending movement\r\nof uniform growth, but can also be caused to vary _qualitatively_,\r\nthat is, in its characters, because its component parts change their\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nOf course we know nothing definite or precise with regard to the units\r\nof the germ-plasm, and we cannot tell what is necessary in order\r\nthat a determinant shall determine a part of the developing body in\r\nthis way or in that; thus we have no definite idea of the relations\r\nsubsisting between the variations of the determinants and those of\r\ntheir determinates, but we know at least so much, that hereditary\r\nvariation of a part is only possible when a corresponding particle\r\nin the germ-plasm varies; and we may at least assume that these\r\ncorrespond to each other so far, that a greater development of the one\r\nimplies a greater development of the other, and that a reversal of\r\nthese relations is impossible. If the determinant _X_ disappears from\r\nthe germ-plasm the determinate _X´_ disappears from the soma. It is\r\ntherefore justifiable to infer from the degree of development of an\r\norgan the strength of its determinant, and to assume that plus- and\r\nminus-variations in both are correspondingly large.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to the fluctuations in the equilibrium of the\r\ngerm-plasm which lie at the root of all hereditary variation, we have\r\nto take into account something which we have already touched upon\r\nbriefly--the correlation of the determinants, the influencing of one\r\ndeterminant by those round about it. I have spoken for the sake of\r\nbrevity of 'the determinant' of a part, although all the large and\r\nmore important parts must certainly be thought of as represented by\r\nseveral or many, if not, indeed, by whole groups of determinants.\r\nAlthough it is quite out of our power to follow the complex processes\r\nof the mutual influences of the determinants upon each other, we can\r\nsay this at least, _that these influences must exist_, and we have\r\nhere a faint indication of what must occur in the case of spontaneous\r\nvariations within the germ-plasm. We must, in the first place, think\r\nof the individual determinants as arranged in groups, so that, for\r\ninstance, the determinants of the right and left half of the body lie\r\ntogether, and therefore are frequently affected together by influences\r\nwhich cause variation, so that both vary in the same direction at\r\nthe same time. In point of fact, analogous deformities, such as\r\npolydactylism of both right and left hands, and even of hands and feet\r\nat once, do actually occur. That the right and left hands, the fore-\r\nand hind-limbs, are represented in the germ by particular determinants,\r\nmay be inferred from their frequently different phyletic evolution into\r\ndifferent forms of hand and foot, e.g. into flipper and rudimentary\r\nhind-leg in the whale, as well as from the cases of particulate\r\ninheritance, which are rare, but which undoubtedly do occur, such\r\nas when, in Man, there is a maternal blue eye on one side of the\r\nhead and a paternal brown eye on the other. But almost more striking\r\nthan the differences between these homologous or homotypic parts\r\nare their points of resemblance, and these may probably be in part\r\nreferred to their disposition side by side and common history in the\r\ngerm-substance, although a far larger proportion of them are probably\r\ndue to their adaptation to similar functions, and are therefore to be\r\nregarded as a phenomenon of convergence within the same organism.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the first increase in the growth of one\r\ndeterminant means a withdrawal of nourishment, however slight, from its\r\nneighbours; this can, of course, be equalized again if the claims on\r\nthe common nutritive stream from another quarter are at the same time\r\ndiminished; but it is possible that the claims from another quarter\r\nmay also be increased, and the withdrawal will then be more marked,\r\nand the determinants being thus injured from two directions at once\r\nwill sink downwards with greater rapidity. But it is also conceivable\r\nthat the majority of determinants of a part may vary upwards, and,\r\nby their combined increased power of assimilation, direct towards\r\nthemselves such a greatly increased stream of nourishment that the\r\nwhole organ--for instance, a particular feather in a bird--varies in an\r\nupward direction, and becomes larger and larger, as we see in the case\r\nof many decorative feathers; or that certain determinants vary only as\r\nfar as some of their biophors are concerned, and similarly for their\r\ndeterminates, as when a group of scales on a butterfly's wing that had\r\npreviously been black turn out a brilliant blue. It can probably also\r\nhappen that such variations within the determinants are transmitted to\r\nneighbouring determinants because the nutritive conditions which caused\r\nthe first to vary have extended to those about them. The increase of\r\nbrightly coloured spots in birds and butterflies gives us ground for\r\nconcluding that there are processes of this kind within the germ-plasm.\r\n\r\nI will refrain from following this idea into greater detail, and\r\ntranslating the observable relations and variations of the fully-formed\r\nparts of the body into the language of the germ-plasm; but so much may\r\nbe taken as certain, that multitudinous inter-relations and influences\r\nexist between the elements of the germ-plasm, and that one variation\r\nbrings another in its train, so that--usually at a very slow rate,\r\nthat is, in the course of generations and of species-forming, definite\r\nvariations occur from purely intra-germinal reasons--variations\r\nwhich as far as they remain outside the limits of good or bad may of\r\nthemselves change the character of a species, but which when they are\r\nseized upon by personal selection may, by sifting and combination of\r\nthe ids, be led on to still higher development.\r\n\r\nIf we consider further that the variation of a part must depend\r\nnot only on the quality of the external stimulus but also upon the\r\nconstitution, the reacting power of the part, we shall understand that\r\nsimilar nutritive variations may cause two different determinants to\r\nvary in different ways, and when we reflect that every nutritive change\r\nmust extend from the point from which it started with diminishing\r\nstrength in a particular direction, we have a further factor in the\r\nvariation of determinants and one which influences even similar\r\ndeterminants differently.\r\n\r\nFinally, if we remember that determinants of different constitution\r\nwill also extract different ingredients from the nutritive stream and\r\nthus set up in it different kinds of chemical change, thus causing\r\nan altered supply of nutritive substances to flow to the neighbour\r\ndeterminants, we get some insight into a very complex and delicate\r\nbut perfectly definite set of processes, into a mechanism which we\r\ncan certainly only guess at, but whose results lie plainly before\r\nus in the spontaneous variations of the organism. We understand in\r\nprinciple the possibility of saltatory variation, as a more or less\r\nwidespread, more or less marked disturbance of the species-type in\r\nthis or that group of characters, and we may acknowledge that those\r\n'kaleidoscopic variations' which Eimer supposed to be the sole basis\r\nof the transformation of species, and which have been brought to the\r\nforeground again quite recently by De Vries[20], are probably factors\r\nin transmutation operative within a limited sphere.\r\n\r\n[20] See end of chap. xxxiii.\r\n\r\nBut we must think of all these struggles and mutual influencings as\r\ntaking place on the smallest possible scale, so that it is only by\r\nlong summation that they can produce any visible effect, and we must\r\nnever forget the essential significance of the plurality of ids, for\r\nthese 'spontaneous' variations may take place in a different and quite\r\nindependent manner in each individual id. If this were not so no\r\nintervention of personal selection would be possible, natural selection\r\nwould not exist, and the adaptation of the organism from the single\r\ncell up to the whole would remain wholly unexplained. The whole crop of\r\nspontaneous germ-variations, whenever it ceases to be 'indifferent,'\r\nand becomes either 'good' or 'bad,' comes under the shears of personal\r\nselection and under its almost sovereign sway.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the sudden first appearance of a saltatory variation\r\ntakes place quite independently of personal selection, depending on\r\nsimilar variations in a number of ids, which remain latent until they\r\nhave by the process of reducing division which precedes amphimixis,\r\nchanced to attain a majority. In sudden bud-variations we may perhaps\r\nsuppose that reducing division occurring in some still unverified\r\nabnormal manner is the reason why the germinal variation suddenly makes\r\nitself visible--a supposition previously suggested as the explanation\r\nof the reversion of these sports.\r\n\r\nThe rarity of bud-variation is thus explained, while the greater\r\nfrequency of saltatory variations in plants propagated by seed may\r\nbe accounted for by the regular occurrence of reducing division in\r\nsexual reproduction. But that the same or similar variations may\r\noccur in several, it may be in many, ids at the same time must depend\r\nupon similar general influences which affect the plant as a whole, as\r\nhappens through cultivation, manuring, and so on. I shall return to\r\nthis when discussing the influence of the environment.\r\n\r\nIn some quarters this whole conception of germinal selection has been\r\ncharacterized as the merest figment of imagination, condemned on this\r\nground alone, that it is based on the differences in nutrition between\r\nsuch extremely minute quantities of substance as the chromosomes of\r\nnuclear substance within the germ-cell. The quantity of substance\r\nis certainly minute, but it needs nutriment none the less, and can\r\nwe believe that the stream of nourishment for all the invisibly\r\nminute vital elements is exactly alike? It may be admitted that the\r\nnourishment outside the ids is usually abundant, although undoubtedly\r\nfluctuations occur in it also, but it certainly does not follow from\r\nthis that every vital unit within the id is similarly disposed in\r\nrelation to the nutritive supply, or has food in equal quantities at\r\nits command, or even that each has as much as it can ever need. To make\r\nan assertion like this seems to me much the same as if an inhabitant\r\nof the moon, looking at this earth through an excellent telescope and\r\nclearly descrying the city of Berlin with its thronging crowds and its\r\nrailways bringing in the necessaries of life from every side, should\r\nconclude from this abundant provision that the greatest superfluity\r\nprevailed within the town, and that every one of its inhabitants had as\r\nmuch to live upon as he could possibly require.\r\n\r\nWe certainly ought not to conclude from the fact that we cannot see\r\ninto the structure and requirements and methods of nutrition of a\r\nvery minute mass of substance that its nutrition cannot be unequal,\r\nand that it cannot, by its inequalities, give rise to very material\r\ndifferences, especially when we are dealing with a substance to which\r\nwe must attribute an extraordinarily complex organization built up of\r\nenormous numbers of extremely minute particles. That this complexity\r\nis undeniable is now admitted by many who formerly thought it possible\r\nto believe in the simple structure of the germ-substance. How complex\r\nnot only the germ-substance but every cell of a higher organism is\r\nin its structure, and how far below the limits of visibility its\r\ndifferentiations and arrangements reach, is pressed upon our attention\r\nby the most recent histological researches, such as those we owe to\r\nHeidenhain, Boveri, and many others. The whole scientific world was\r\namazed when it came to know the mysterious nuclear spindle in the\r\nseventies, and since then this has been quite thrown into the shade by\r\nthe discovery of the centrosphere, the centrosome, and more recently\r\neven the centriole, and now we believe that these marvellous centres\r\nof force may, or must, possess their own dividing apparatus! In the\r\nface of discoveries like these no one is likely to be able to persist\r\nin recognizing as existing only what is disclosed or even hinted at by\r\nthe most powerful lenses; no one can any longer doubt that far below\r\nthe limit of visibility organization is still at the basis of life,\r\nand that it is dominated by orderly forces. To me, at least, it seems\r\nmore cogent to argue from the phenomena of heredity and variation to\r\nan enormous mass of minute vital units crowded together in the narrow\r\nspace of the id, than to argue from the calculated size of atoms and\r\nmolecules to the number which we are justified in assuming to be\r\npresent in an id. In my book on the germ-plasm I made a calculation of\r\nthis kind, and I arrived at figures which seemed rather too small for\r\nthe requirements of the germ-plasm theory. This has been regarded as\r\na proof that I disregard the facts for the sake of my theory, but it\r\nshould rather be asked whether the size of the atoms and molecules is\r\na fact, and not rather the very questionable result of an uncertain\r\nmethod of calculation. Undoubtedly modern chemistry has established\r\nthe _relative_ weight-proportions of the atoms and molecules with\r\nadmirable precision, but it can make only very uncertain statements\r\nin regard to the _absolute_ size of the ultimate particles. It is\r\ntherefore admissible to assume that these have a still greater degree\r\nof minuteness when the facts in another domain of science require this.\r\n\r\nWe _must_ assume determinants, and consequently the germ-plasm must\r\nhave room for these; the variations of species can only be explained\r\nthrough variations of the germ-plasm, for these alone give rise to\r\nhereditary variation. It is upon this foundation that my germinal\r\nselection is built up; whether I have in the main reached the truth the\r\nfuture will show: but that I have not exhausted this new domain, but\r\nonly opened it up, I am very well aware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE BIOGENETIC LAW\r\n\r\n Fritz Müller's ideas--Development of the Crustaceans--Of\r\n the Daphnidæ--Of Sacculina--Of parasitic Copepods--Larvæ\r\n of the higher Crustaceans--Change of phyletic stages in\r\n Ontogeny--Haeckel's _Fundamental Biogenetic Law_--Palingenesis\r\n and Cœnogenesis--Variation of phyletic forms by interpolation in\r\n a lengthened Ontogeny--Justification of deductions from Ontogeny\r\n to Phylogeny--Würtemberger's series of Ammonites--Phylogeny of the\r\n markings in the caterpillars of the Sphingidæ--Condensation of\r\n Phylogeny in Ontogeny--Example from the Crustaceans--Disappearance\r\n of useless parts--The variation of homologous parts, according\r\n to Emery--Germ-plasmic correlations--Harmony with the theory of\r\n determinants--Multiplication of the determinants in the course of the\r\n phylogeny.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I propose to discuss in this lecture should have been considered\r\nat an earlier stage, if we had pledged ourselves to adhere strictly\r\nto the historical sequence of scientific discovery, for the phenomena\r\nwhich we are about to deal with attained recognition shortly after\r\nthe revival of the evolution idea, and indeed they formed the first\r\nimportant discovery which was made on the basis of the Darwinian\r\nDoctrine of Descent. I have introduced them at this stage because\r\nthey have to do with phenomena of inheritance and modifications of\r\nthese, the understanding of which--in as far as we can as yet speak\r\nof understanding at all--is only possible on the basis of a theory\r\nof inheritance. Therefore, in order to examine these phenomena and\r\ntheir causes, it was necessary first to submit a theory of heredity,\r\nas I have done in the germ-plasm theory. We have to treat of the\r\nconnexion between the _development_ of many-celled individuals and\r\nthe _evolution_ of the species, between germinal history and racial\r\nhistory, or, as we say with Haeckel, between ontogeny and phylogeny.\r\n\r\nLong before Darwin's day individual naturalists had observed that\r\ncertain stages in the development of the higher vertebrates, such as\r\nbirds and mammals, showed a likeness to fishes, and they had spoken\r\nof a fish-like stage of the bird-embryo. The 'Natural Philosophers'\r\nof the beginning of the nineteenth century, Oken, Treviranus, Meckel,\r\nand others, had, on the basis of the transmutation theory of the time,\r\ngone much further, and had professed to recognize in the embryonic\r\nhistory of Man, for example, a repetition of the different animal\r\nstages, from polyp and worm up to insect and mollusc. But von Baer\r\nafterwards showed that such resemblances are never between different\r\ntypes, but only between representatives of the same general type,\r\ne.g. that of Vertebrata; and Johannes Müller maintained, from the\r\nstandpoint of the old Creation theory, that an 'expression of the\r\nmost general and simple plan of the Vertebrates' recurred in the\r\ndevelopment of higher Vertebrates, giving as an instance that, at a\r\ncertain stage of embryogenesis, even in Man, gill-arches were laid down\r\nand were subsequently absorbed. But why this 'plan' should have been\r\ncarried out where it was afterwards to be departed from remained quite\r\nunintelligible.\r\n\r\nAn answer to this question only became possible with the revival of\r\nthe Theory of Descent, and the first to throw light in this direction\r\nwas Fritz Müller, who, in his work _Für Darwin_, published in 1864,\r\ninterpreted the developmental history of the individual, 'the\r\nontogeny,' as a shortened and simplified repetition, a recapitulation,\r\nso to speak, of the racial history of the species, the 'phylogeny.' But\r\nat the same time he recognized quite clearly--what indeed was plain to\r\nall eyes--that the 'racial history' cannot be simply read out of the\r\n'germinal history,' but that the phylogeny is often 'blurred,' on the\r\none hand by the fusing and shortening of its stages, since development\r\nis always 'striking out' a more direct course from the egg to the\r\nperfect animal, while, on the other hand, it is frequently 'falsified'\r\nby the struggle for existence which the free-living larvæ have to\r\nmaintain.\r\n\r\nFor the establishment of these views Fritz Müller relied chiefly upon\r\nlarvæ, and in particular upon those of Crustaceans, and the facts,\r\nwhich were in part new and in part interpreted in a new manner, were\r\nso striking that it was impossible to deny their importance. In\r\nparticular, he drew attention to the fact that in several of the lower\r\norders of Crustaceans the most diverse species have a similar form when\r\nthey leave the egg, all of them being small, unsegmented larvæ, with\r\na frontal eye and a helmet-like upper lip, and with three pairs of\r\nappendages, the two posterior pairs being two-branched swimming-legs\r\nbeset with bristles. In the size and form of the body, and especially\r\nof the chitinous carapace, these larvæ differ in the various systematic\r\ngroups; thus, for instance, the larvæ of the Copepods are simply\r\noval, while those of the Cirrhipedes are produced anteriorly into two\r\nhorn-like processes, and so on, but in essentials they are all alike,\r\nand for a long time these larval forms had been distinguished by the\r\nspecial name of 'Nauplius' (Fig. 109).\r\n\r\nThe development of the perfect animal begins with the longitudinal\r\ngrowth of the Nauplius; the posterior end lengthens and becomes\r\nsegmented, between the anterior portion and the tail more segments are\r\ninterpolated, and on these new pairs of limbs may grow. The number\r\nof these segments and limbs varies according to the group to which\r\nthe animal belongs. Thus the body of the perfect animal in the little\r\nCyprids always consists of eight segments, seven of which bear a pair\r\nof limbs apiece; in the Branchiopods, on the other hand, the number\r\nof segments varies from twenty to sixty, with ten to over forty pairs\r\nof legs; in the Daphnids or water-fleas there are about ten segments,\r\nwith seven to ten pairs of limbs, and in the Copepods about seventeen\r\nsegments with eleven pairs of limbs. The difference between the orders\r\ndepends not only upon the differences in the number of segments and\r\nlimbs, but quite as much upon the form and development of the segments,\r\nand above all of the limbs, and in this connexion it is worthy of note\r\nthat the additional limbs which grow out usually appear at first as\r\nbiramose swimming-legs, and are subsequently modified in form. Thus\r\nthe pairs of jaws, three in number, which appear in the Copepods are\r\ndeveloped from such swimming-legs, and so also is the second pair of\r\nantennæ in the Copepods and the jaws of the Branchiopods, Cirrhipedes,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108. Nauplius larva of one of the lower\r\nCrustaceans. After Fritz Müller. _Au_, the frontal eye; _I_, first pair\r\nof limbs, corresponding to the future antennæ; _II_ and _III_, two\r\nbiramose swimming appendages.]\r\n\r\nIf then we have before us in the 'germinal history' (ontogeny) a fairly\r\nprecise repetition of the 'racial history' (phylogeny), we may deduce\r\nfrom this that the primitive forms of the Crustacean race were animals\r\nwhich consisted of few segments, and that from these, in the course\r\nof the earth's history, the very diverse modern groups of Crustaceans\r\nhave arisen, by the addition of new segments, and the adaptation of\r\nthe limbs upon them, which were at first biramose swimming-legs, to\r\ndifferent kinds of functions, one becoming an antenna, another a jaw\r\nor a swimming-arm, a third, fourth, fifth, and so on, a jumping-leg, a\r\ncopulatory organ, an egg-bearer, a gill-bearer, or a tail-fin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109. Metamorphosis of one of the higher Crustacea,\r\na Shrimp (_Peneus potimirim_), after Fritz Müller. _A_, the nauplius\r\nlarva with the three pairs of appendages: _I_, the antennæ; _II_ and\r\n_III_, the biramose swimming-feet. _Au_, the single eye. _B_, first\r\nZoæa stage, with six pairs of appendages (_I-VI_). _Skn_, area where\r\nnew segments are being formed.]\r\n\r\nThat the development has in general followed those lines is made clear\r\nchiefly by the fact that the members of all these different orders of\r\nCrustaceans still arise from nauplius larvæ, even in those cases in\r\nwhich the perfect animal possesses a structure differing widely from\r\nthe usual Crustacean form. _All_ Crustaceans arise from the _nauplius\r\nform_, even those of the higher orders, though they may not arise from\r\na nauplius _larva_. But this very circumstance, that in most of the\r\nhigher and many of the lower Crustaceans, the young animal, when it\r\nemerges from the egg, already possesses more numerous segments and\r\nlimbs than a nauplius larva, again points to the connexion between\r\nphylogeny and ontogeny, for in these cases the nauplius stage _is gone\r\nthrough within the ovum_. The whole difference between this and the\r\nforms we considered first lies in the fact that, in the latter, the\r\ndevelopment is greatly shortened, condensed, as we might say, so that\r\nthe nauplius stage forms a part of the _embryonic_ development, and\r\nthat new segments and limbs develop in the embryo nauplius within the\r\negg, so that the young animal leaves the egg in a more advanced state,\r\nnearer to that of the perfect animal, to which it can, therefore,\r\nattain in a shorter time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109. _C_, second Zoæa stage. The thorax is now\r\ndivided into cephalothorax (_Cph_) and abdomen (_Abd_); seven pairs of\r\nappendages are developed, and five more (_VIII-XII_) are beginning to\r\nappear. _Au_, paired eyes.]\r\n\r\nWe should expect that this shortening of the larval period would be\r\nassociated with a prolongation of embryogenesis, especially in those\r\nCrustaceans which possess a large number of segments and limbs, that\r\nis--in the higher forms--and in the main this is the case. But there\r\nare exceptions in two directions; in the first place there are some,\r\neven among the lower Crustaceans, which leave the egg not as a nauplius\r\nbut in the perfect form of the adult, and secondly, there are, among\r\nthe higher Crustaceans, certain species which emerge from the egg not\r\nin the more mature form but still in the primitive nauplius form.\r\nFritz Müller was the first to furnish an example of this last case,\r\na Brazilian shrimp, _Peneus potimirim_. Like the lowest Copepods or\r\nBranchiopods, this species, which belongs to the highest order of\r\nCrustaceans, goes through the whole long development, from the nauplius\r\nthrough a series of higher larval forms up to the perfect animal,\r\nand all _outside of the egg_, as an independent free-swimming larva\r\n(Fig. 109, _A-E_). This is in sharp contrast to its near relative, the\r\nfreshwater crayfish, which goes through this whole development within\r\nthe egg, and emerges perfectly formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109. _D_, Mysis-stage. Thirteen pairs of appendages\r\nare now formed: _I_ and _II_, antennæ; _III_, mandibles; _IV_ and\r\n_V_, maxillæ; _VI-XIII_, swimming appendages with one branch or with\r\ntwo. _Abd_, abdomen. _Sfl_, tail-fin. _E_, the fully-formed Shrimp,\r\nwith thirteen pairs of appendages on the cephalothorax (_Cph_); _I_\r\nand _II_, the two pairs of antennæ; then follow the maxillæ and\r\nmaxillipedes (_III-VIII_), the last of which is visible in the figure,\r\nand the five pairs of walking-legs (_IX-XIII_) of which the third bears\r\na long chela. On the abdomen there are now six pairs of appendages\r\n(_XIV-XIX_).]\r\n\r\nWe see from this example that it is not some inward necessity which\r\nthus, in the higher and more complicated organism, contracts the\r\nontogeny into the embryonic state, but that this depends upon external\r\nadaptive factors. Here again we have adaptation, mainly to the\r\nconditions of larval life. The elimination of the larvæ by enemies,\r\nfor instance, will, other things being equal, be so much the more\r\nincisive the longer the larval development is protracted, but in that\r\ncase the general ratio of elimination of the species, and the degree\r\nof fertility the species must possess in order to hold its own in the\r\nstruggle for existence, will also play a part in determining the mode\r\nof development. For the higher the ratio of elimination the more eggs\r\nthe female must produce, and the more eggs that have to be produced the\r\nsmaller will be the quantity of nutritive material for the building\r\nup of the young embryo which each egg can be furnished with. I know\r\nof no records in regard to the eggs of that Brazilian shrimp in which\r\nembryonic development ends with the nauplius stage, but we shall\r\ncertainly not be wrong in predicting that the eggs in this case will be\r\nvery small and very numerous, in contrast to those of the freshwater\r\ncrayfish, which are large and, as compared with others known to us, not\r\nvery numerous.\r\n\r\nIt is a point of undeniable theoretical significance which the\r\nlife-histories of these Crustaceans disclose, that embryogenesis is\r\nnot condensed according to hidden internal laws when the structure\r\nincreases in complexity, but that the condensation of the ontogenetic\r\nstages depends upon adaptation, and may be quite different in nearly\r\nrelated species. It shows us anew that all biological occurrences are\r\ndominated by the process of selection.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned that exceptions to the usual mode of\r\ndevelopment occur even among the lower Crustaceans, and I was thinking\r\nat the time of the Daphnids, which leave the egg as fully formed little\r\nanimals, already equipped with all their segments and limbs. The\r\nnauplius stage is passed through in the egg, and it is an interesting\r\nindication that the ancestors of the modern species were in the way of\r\nmoulting, that this embryo nauplius moults within the egg by forming\r\na fine cuticle which is shed after a time. If it be asked why there\r\nshould be direct development in the case of these small and not very\r\ncomplex water-fleas, while related species, the Branchiopods, which are\r\nmuch richer in segments and in limbs, should emerge from the egg in\r\nthe form of a nauplius, and then pass through a longer larval period,\r\nwe may answer that the reason probably lies in the fact that, in the\r\nformer case, very few eggs are produced, sometimes only one, often two,\r\nseldom more than a dozen, that these eggs can thus be relatively well\r\nequipped with yolk, and that the formation of the little body which\r\nbears only from seven to nine pairs of limbs can be easily completed\r\nwithin this egg. Other things being equal, the direct development\r\nwould always be an advantage, because reproduction can begin sooner in\r\nthe young generation and the number of individuals will thus increase\r\nmore rapidly. And this is of particular importance in the case of the\r\nwater-fleas.\r\n\r\nBut if it be asked, further, why so few eggs are produced in this\r\ncase, and whether these animals have no enemies, we must answer that,\r\non the contrary, they are preyed upon and eaten in thousands by\r\nfishes and other freshwater animals, but that the drawback of the\r\nscanty production of eggs is counteracted on the one hand by their\r\nhabit of reproducing parthenogenetically for the greater part of the\r\nyear, and on the other hand by their habit of concealing the eggs in a\r\nspecial brood-chamber. This is the case not only in the summer eggs,\r\nto which nourishment is conveyed in the brood-chamber from the blood\r\nof the mother (Fig. 70), but also in the winter or 'lasting' eggs,\r\nwhich receive within the chamber a protecting covering (the shell or\r\nephippium).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70 (repeated). Daphnella. _A_, summer ovum, with an\r\noil-globule (_Oe_). _B_, winter ovum.]\r\n\r\nIn almost all the Daphnids the winter egg develops into a perfect\r\nanimal just like that to which the summer egg gives rise, although\r\nit no longer receives any nourishment after it passes into the\r\nbrood-chamber. But it receives a larger supply of yolk on this account,\r\nso that the nutritive provision within the egg is sufficient to develop\r\nthe perfect animal. There is only one exception to this, and it is\r\nof special theoretical interest, because it shows more plainly than\r\nany other fact that the greater or less degree of condensation in the\r\nontogeny depends upon the combined effect of the external conditions of\r\nlife. The largest of the Daphnidæ, _Leptodora hyalina_, a beautifully\r\ntransparent inhabitant of our lakes, which measures about a centimetre\r\nin length (Fig. 110), also emerges from the summer egg as a perfect\r\nanimal, but from the winter egg, which floats freely in the water and\r\nhas only a small provision of yolk, it emerges as a nauplius, which\r\nthen undergoes larval metamorphosis before it becomes a perfect animal\r\n(Fig. 111).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110. The largest of the Daphnids (_Leptodora\r\nhyalina_), with summer ova (_Ei_) beneath the shell (_Sch_). _I-IX_,\r\nthe appendages. _II_, the oars (second antennæ) which always remain\r\nbiramose in Daphnids. _sb_, setæ. _ov_, ovaries. _Schl_, œsophagus.\r\n_Ma_, stomach. _a_, anus. _H_, heart. _Au_, eye. _nG_, natural size.]\r\n\r\nFritz Müller concluded from the repetition of the nauplius form in all\r\norders of Crustaceans that the primitive form of the Crustacean must\r\nhave been a nauplius, and that from it all the modern Crustaceans must\r\nhave evolved phyletically by the addition of segments varying in number\r\nand differentiation. Now, however, it is doubted whether there ever\r\nwere nauplioid types capable of reproduction. But even if the nauplii\r\nonly _represent what have been the larval_ forms from very early times,\r\nthey are equally important in illustrating the relations between\r\nontogeny and phylogeny; they at any rate represent the primitive\r\npre-cambrian larval form from which all modern Crustaceans are derived.\r\nThis is borne out not only by the facts to which we have already\r\nreferred, but also by those Crustacean-groups which have diverged far\r\nfrom the usual Crustacean habit and type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111. Nauplius larva from the winter egg of\r\n_Leptodora hyalina_; after Sars.]\r\n\r\nThus the sessile Cirrhipedes, with their mollusc-like shells, their\r\nsoft, unsegmented bodies, degenerate heads, and their twelve vibratile\r\nfood-wafting limbs, emerge from the egg as nauplius larvæ. But the\r\nremarkable parasites on the shore-crabs and the hermit-crab deviate\r\nmuch further from the type of the rest of the Crustaceans, for they\r\nhang like a sac or formless sausage-like soft mass to the abdomen of\r\ntheir host, growing into it by fine, pale, root-like threads, through\r\nwhich they suck up the blood of their hosts (Fig. 112, _C. Sacc._).\r\nThey possess neither head, nor thorax, nor abdomen, not even an\r\nindication of segmentation, no limbs of any kind, neither antennæ, nor\r\nmouth parts, nor swimming-legs. Nevertheless they are Crustaceans;\r\nindeed, we can say with certainty that they belong to the order of\r\nCirrhipedes, for they leave the egg in the form of a nauplius larva\r\n(_A_), with 'horns' on their carapace which no other forms except\r\nthemselves and the Cirrhipedes possess. That they are of the same\r\nstock as these is also proved by their further development, for the\r\nnauplius grows first, just as in the case of the Cirrhipedes proper,\r\ninto a 'Cypris-like larva' (_B_), so called because it bears a certain\r\nresemblance to the Ostracods of the genus Cypris, and only from this\r\npoint do their paths of development diverge. The Cypris-like larva of\r\nthe true Cirrhipedes settles down somewhere, attached by its antennæ;\r\nit grows, and its body becomes that of the perfect Cirrhipede; but the\r\nCypris-like larva of the Sacculinæ bores its way into the inside of a\r\ncrab or hermit-crab, at the same time losing its limbs, segmentation,\r\nand its chitinous covering; and within the body of its host it is\r\ntransformed into the sac-like organism we have already described. After\r\na time it emerges again on the surface, and remains attached to the\r\nabdomen of its host (Fig. 112, _C. Sacc._), drawing its nourishment\r\nfrom the blood which it sucks up by means of its numerous delicate\r\nroots (_W_, _W_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112. Development of the parasitic Crustacean\r\n_Sacculina carcini_, after Delage. _A_, Nauplius stage. _Au_, eye.\r\n_I_, _II_, _III_, the three pairs of appendages. _B_, Cypris-stage.\r\n_VI_-_XI_, the swimming appendages. _C_, mature animal (_Sacc_),\r\nattached to its host, the shore-crab (_Carcinus mænus_), with a\r\nfeltwork of fine root-processes enveloping the crab's viscera.\r\n_s_, stalk. _Sacc_, body of the parasite. _oe_, aperture of the\r\nbrood-cavity. _Abd_, abdomen of the crab with the anus (_a_).]\r\n\r\nFrom all this we may conclude that certain Cirrhipedes in times long\r\npast adopted a parasitic habit in the Cypris-larva stage, and that they\r\ngradually underwent adaptations to this mode of life, and that these\r\nwent further and further, until the animal was transformed into the\r\nsingular creature which we now see in the sexually mature form.\r\n\r\nThe same is the case with the numerous fish-parasites of the order\r\nCopepoda. They all leave the egg as nauplius larvæ, however greatly\r\nthey may be modified later on by adaptation to a parasitic habit,\r\nand in them we can still observe, in the fully developed animals,\r\na whole series of grades of transformation. Thus many genera, like\r\n_Ergasilus_, are distinguished from the free-swimming Copepods only\r\nby the modification of their jaws into piercing and sucking organs,\r\nand of a single pair of antennæ into hooks, by means of which they\r\nattach themselves to the fish on which they feed. In other genera the\r\ndegeneration and modification go further; the antennæ, the eye, and\r\nthe appendages degenerate more or less, and very remarkable attaching\r\norgans are sometimes developed, in the form of hooks or of knobbed\r\npincers, or of actual suckers. In several types the degeneration and\r\nmodification go so far that the segmentation of the body disappears,\r\nand the animal looks more like an intestinal worm than like a\r\nCrustacean (_Lernæocera_ and others). In all these forms adapted to a\r\nparasitic mode of life it is always only the mature animal which has\r\nbeen transformed in this manner, for previously it has gone through a\r\nseries of stages which are quite similar to those of the free-swimming\r\nCopepods, beginning with the nauplius, and ending with the so-called\r\nCyclops stage, that is, a larval form which possesses antennæ, eyes,\r\nand swimming-legs similar to our freshwater Copepods of the genus\r\n_Cyclops_.\r\n\r\nHere again we see in the ontogeny the repetition of a series of\r\nphyletic stages before the mature form is assumed. Why these stages\r\nshould have persisted it is easy enough to understand, for how could an\r\nanimal which emerged from the egg as a worm-shaped _Lernæocera_ find a\r\nfresh fish which would serve it as host? Yet these parasites could not\r\npossibly go on preying upon the same fish generation after generation.\r\nTo secure the existence of the species it was therefore indispensable\r\nthat the faculty of swimming should be retained at least in the young\r\nstages; in other words, that the free-swimming ancestral stages should\r\nbe preserved in the ontogeny. In all these cases it is therefore beyond\r\ndoubt that the germinal history recapitulates a series of stages\r\ncomparable to those of the racial history, although not quite unchanged\r\nbut adapted to the modern conditions of life, for instance in having\r\nshorter antennæ, smaller eyes, and with four instead of the usual five\r\nswimming-legs. The search for a host does not seem to last long, for\r\nfishes are usually found in large numbers together, and thus the young\r\nparasitic Crustacean does not require to make a long journey before it\r\nfinds a refuge.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the males of parasitic Crustaceans are not\r\nonly much smaller than the females (Fig. 113), but that they are\r\nalso much less modified, and resemble the ancestral free-swimming\r\nCopepods to a much greater degree. They usually possess small but\r\nwell-developed swimming-legs, and by means of these they seek out the\r\nfemale, dying after fertilization is accomplished. They are thus not\r\nsessile parasites at all, and have therefore to go through the stages\r\nof the free-swimming Copepods much more completely than the females,\r\nwhose task is to accumulate within themselves from the blood of the\r\nfish as much material as possible for the forming of the eggs, and to\r\nproduce the largest possible number of these. These therefore greatly\r\nsurpass the free-swimming Copepods in fertility, as is evidenced by the\r\nenormous egg-sacs they bear at the posterior end of the body (Fig. 113,\r\n_ei_).\r\n\r\nEven among the higher Crustaceans, the so-called Malacostraca, the\r\ngerminal history not infrequently exhibits more or less of the racial\r\nhistory in distinct recapitulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113. The two sexes of the parasitic Crustacean\r\n_Chondracanthus gibbosus_, enlarged about six times; after Claus.\r\nThe main figure is that of the female, whose body bears quaint blunt\r\nprocesses. At its genital aperture (♂) a dwarf male is situated.\r\n_F_ and _F´_, the two pairs of appendages. _ei_, the long egg-sacs,\r\nportions of which have been cut off in the figure.]\r\n\r\nIt is true however, as we have already shown, that there are only a\r\nfew of the higher Crustaceans which emerge from the egg in the form\r\nof a nauplius; in most of them this stage has been shunted backwards\r\nin the ontogeny, and most of the crabs and hermit-crabs leave the egg\r\nin a higher larval form, that of the so-called Zoæa (Fig. 114). This\r\nterm is applied to a larva which already exhibits two main divisions\r\nof the body, a head and thorax portion (cephalothorax, _Cph_) and\r\nan abdomen (_abd_). The cephalothorax is frequently equipped with\r\nremarkable long spines (_st_), and it always bears from five to eight\r\npairs of limbs, anteriorly the antennæ (_I_ and _II_), then the\r\nmandibles (_III_), further back swimming-legs (_IV_, _V_), and behind\r\nthese can be recognized the primordia of the other legs (_VI_-_XIII_),\r\nwhich will grow freely out later on. Large facetted and stalked eyes\r\n(_Au_) are borne on the head. This Zoæa form is not now found as a\r\nmature Crustacean form, so we cannot maintain with any confidence\r\nthat it lived as a mature animal at an earlier period of the earth's\r\nhistory, but a second still more complex larval form of the higher\r\nCrustaceans is preserved for us in a group of marine Crustaceans, the\r\nSchizopods. These are Crustaceans which, though small, approach in\r\nexternal appearance our freshwater crayfish, only they have, instead\r\nof the ten walking-legs, biramose swimming-legs, by means of which\r\nthey move freely in the water. The number of these branched legs is\r\neven greater than ten, there are sixteen of them (Fig. 109 _D_, p.\r\n164, _VI_-_XIII_). In the aquaria of the Zoological Station at Naples\r\none may often see these dainty little creatures swimming about in\r\nlarge companies. Here they are of interest to us chiefly because their\r\nstructure occurs in the ontogeny of the highest Crustaceans, the\r\nDecapods; that is, the phyletic stage represented by the Schizopods\r\nappears as an ontogenetic stage, just before the final metamorphosis of\r\nthe larva to the perfect animal. This is the case in most of the marine\r\nDecapods, in those forms which do not go through the whole course of\r\ntheir development within the egg, but emerge as Zoæa larvæ, or even,\r\nas in _Peneus potimirim_, as nauplii. In the last-named species (Fig.\r\n109) the ontogeny contains at least three stages which must have\r\nlived, perhaps not as mature forms, but as primitive larval forms, for\r\nunthinkable ages--the stage of the nauplus (Fig. 109 _A_), that of the\r\nZoæa (Fig. 109 _B_ and _C_), and that of the Schizopod (Fig. 109, _D_);\r\nfrom this last the fully developed Decapod Crustacean arises (Fig. 109,\r\n_E_).\r\n\r\nWe are, therefore, justified in saying that here the racial evolution\r\nis recapitulated in the individual development, although condensed\r\nand shortened in proportion as more numerous stages of the phyletic\r\ndevelopment are gone through within the egg, for there the different\r\nstages can succeed each other more rapidly and directly than in a\r\nmetamorphosis of the free-swimming larvæ, since these must procure\r\ntheir own material for their further growth and their metamorphosis,\r\nwhile the yolk of the egg supplies a store of material which is\r\nsufficient for the production of a whole series of successive stages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114. Zoæa-larva of a Crab, after R. Hertwig.\r\n_I_-_V_, the already functional anterior appendages--antennæ,\r\nmandibles, and swimming-legs. _VI_-_XIII_, rudiments of the posterior\r\nappendages of the cephalothorax (_Cph_). _Abd_, the abdomen. _st_,\r\nspine of the carapace. _Au_, eye. _H_, heart.]\r\n\r\nFor this reason it inevitably resulted that the sharply defined\r\ncharacters of the phyletic stages were more and more lost as soon as\r\nthey were transferred from larval stages to stages in embryogenesis.\r\nFor, in the first place, these sharply defined characters, such as\r\nthe spines of the Zoæa larva, or the swimming bristles of the 'oars,'\r\nor the shape of thorax or abdomen characteristic of certain species,\r\nare adapted to a free life, and would be valueless in an embryonic\r\nstage; and secondly, in the transference of the free larval stages\r\nto embryonic development the greatest possible condensation and\r\nabbreviation of the stages must have been striven for, which could only\r\ncome about by a continual mutual adaptation of the embryonic parts to\r\none another, involving the suppression of everything superfluous.\r\nOtherwise the transference of the free stages to the embryogenesis\r\nwould have brought no advantage, but rather a most prejudicial\r\nprotracting of the development.\r\n\r\nWe must not, therefore, expect to find the stages of the phylogeny\r\noccurring unaltered in every ontogeny in the way we have found the\r\nnauplius, Zoæa, or Mysis stages in the larval development of the\r\nDecapods. I have noticed already that in the water-fleas (Daphnidæ) and\r\nother Crustaceans without metamorphosis the nauplius stage is still\r\npassed through, but within the egg, and as an embryonic stage, and\r\nthis is quite true, but nevertheless it would hardly do to liberate a\r\nnauplius like this from its shell and place it in the water, for the\r\ninfluence of the water upon the delicate embryonic cells of its body\r\nwould soon cause it to swell, and would destroy it utterly. And, even\r\napart from this, it has no hard and resistant chitinous covering, no\r\nfully-developed appendages, but only the stump-like blunt beginnings\r\nof these without swimming-bristles and without muscles capable of\r\nfunction, so that it could not even move. Nevertheless it is a nauplius\r\nwith all its typical distinctive characters, only it is not a perfect\r\nnauplius capable of life, but rather a 'schema' of one, which must be\r\nretained in the embryogenesis that it may give rise to the later stages.\r\n\r\nShall we therefore say that the statement that phylogeny repeats itself\r\nin ontogeny is false, that the nauplius stage within the embryo is\r\nnot a true nauplius at all? That would be pushing precision beyond\r\nreasonable limits, and would obscure our insight into the causal\r\nconnexion between phylogeny and ontogeny, which, as we have seen,\r\nundoubtedly exists.\r\n\r\nA few years after the appearance of Fritz Müller's work _Für\r\nDarwin_, Haeckel elaborated Müller's idea, and applied it in a much\r\nmore comprehensive manner. He formulated it under the name of 'the\r\nfundamental biogenetic law,' and then he used this 'law' to deduce\r\nfrom the ontogeny of animals, and more particularly of Man, the\r\npaths of evolution along which our modern species have passed in the\r\ncourse of the earth's history. In doing so the greatest caution was\r\nnecessary, since ontogeny is not an actual unaltered recapitulation\r\nof the phylogeny, but an 'abridged' and in most cases--in my own\r\nbelief, in all cases--_a greatly modified recapitulation_. Therefore\r\nwe cannot simply accept each ontogenetic stage as an ancestral stage,\r\nbut must take into consideration all the facts supplied to us by other\r\ndepartments of biological inquiry which afford help in the decision\r\nof such questions, especially those brought to light by comparative\r\nmorphology and by the whole range of comparative embryology.\r\n\r\nHaeckel was quite well aware of this difficulty, and repeatedly\r\nemphasized it by laying stress on the fact that a 'blurring' of the\r\nphyletic stages of development had arisen through the abridgement of\r\nthe phylogeny in the ontogeny, and a 'falsification' of it through\r\nthe secondary adaptation of individual ontogenetic stages to new\r\nconditions of life. He therefore distinguished between 'Palingenesis,'\r\nthat is, simple though abridged repetition of the ancestral history,\r\nand 'Cœnogenesis,' that is, modification of the racial history by\r\nlater adaptation of a few or many stages to new conditions of life.\r\nAs an example of cœnogenetic modification, I may cite the pupæ of\r\nbutterflies. Since these can neither feed nor move from one spot, they\r\ncan at no time have been mature forms, and cannot, therefore, represent\r\nindependent ancestors of our modern Lepidoptera; they have originated\r\nthrough the constantly increasing difference between the structure of\r\nthe caterpillar and that of the moth or butterfly. Originally, that is,\r\namong the oldest flying insects, the mature animal could be gradually\r\nprepared within the larva as it grew, so that finally nothing was\r\nnecessary but a single moult to set free the wings, which had in the\r\nmeantime been growing underneath the skin, and to allow the perfect\r\ninsect to emerge, complete in all its parts. This is the case even now\r\nwith the grasshoppers and crickets. In these forms the larval mode of\r\nlife differs very little, if at all, from that of the perfect insect,\r\nand the main difference between the two is the absence of wings in the\r\nlarva. But when the perfect insect adapted itself to conditions of life\r\nquite different from the larval conditions, as was the case with the\r\nnectar-sucking bees and butterflies adapted entirely for flight, while\r\nthe larvæ were still adapted exclusively to an abundant diet of leaves\r\nand other parts of plants, and to a very inactive life upon plants, the\r\ntwo stages of development ultimately diverged so widely in structure\r\nthat the transition from one to the other could no longer be made at\r\na single moulting, and a period of rest had to be interpolated, in\r\norder that the transformation of the body could take place. In this\r\nway arose the stage of the resting and fasting pupa, a 'cœnogenetic'\r\nmodification of the last larval stage, _not a recapitulation of an\r\nancestral form_, but a stage which has been interpolated, or better,\r\nhas 'interpolated itself' into the ontogeny on account of the widely\r\ndifferent adaptations of the early and the final stages.\r\n\r\nThis is a perfectly clear idea, and Haeckel's distinction between\r\npalingenesis and cœnogenesis is undoubtedly justified.\r\n\r\nBut it is quite a different matter to be able to decide whether\r\na particular stage or organ has arisen palingenetically or\r\ncœnogenetically with the same certainty as in the case of the\r\ninsect-pupa, or even with any degree of probability, and we must admit\r\nthat in very many cases, perhaps even in most cases, it is impossible.\r\nThis is so chiefly because pure palingenesis is hardly likely to occur\r\nnow; the ancestral stages were bound to be modified in any case if\r\nthey were to be compressed into the ever-shortening ontogeny of later\r\ndescendants, and particularly so if they were to be shunted back into\r\nembryogenesis. In the latter case they would not only be materially\r\nshortened, and, as I have already shown, modified by the mutual\r\nadaptations of the different developing parts, but time-displacements\r\nof embryonic parts and organs would be necessary, as has been very\r\nclearly proved by the excellent recent investigations, which we owe\r\nin particular to Oppel, Mehnert, and Keibel. A shunting forward or\r\nbackward of the individual organs takes place--conditioned apparently\r\nby the decreasing or increasing importance of the organ in the finished\r\nstate; for in the course of the phylogeny everything may vary, and\r\nnot only may a new, somewhat modified, and often more complex stage\r\nbe added on at the end of the ontogeny, but each one of the preceding\r\nstages may vary independently, whenever this is required by a change\r\nin its relations to the other stages or organs. Adaptation is effected\r\nat every stage and for every part by the process of selection, for all\r\nparts of the same rank are ceaselessly struggling with one another,\r\nfrom the lowest vital units, the biophors, up to the highest, the\r\npersons. If we reflect that, in the course of the phylogeny of every\r\nseries of species, a number of organs always become superfluous and\r\nbegin to disappear in consequence, we can understand what great changes\r\nmust take place gradually as such a series of phyletic stages is\r\ncompressed into the ontogeny, for all organs which are no longer used\r\nare gradually shifted further and further back in the ontogeny till\r\nultimately they disappear from it altogether. But, while the primary\r\nconstituents of these 'vestiges' play their part in ontogeny for a\r\nshorter and shorter time, new acquisitions are being more and more\r\nhighly developed, and thus, in the course of the phylogeny, numerous\r\ntime-displacements of the parts and organs in ontogeny must result, so\r\nthat ultimately it is impossible to compare a particular stage in the\r\nembryogenesis of a species with a particular ancestral form. _Only the\r\nstages of individual organs can be thus compared and parallelized._\r\n\r\nBut we must not on that account 'empty out the child with the bath,'\r\nand conclude that there is no such thing as a 'biogenetic law' or\r\nrecapitulation of the phylogeny in the ontogeny. Not only is there\r\nsuch a recapitulation, but--as F. Müller and Haeckel have already\r\nsaid--ontogeny is nothing but a recapitulation of the phylogeny,\r\nonly with innumerable subtractions and interpolations, additions\r\nand displacements of the organ-stages both in time and place. It\r\nwould be a great mistake to conclude from the fact of these manifold\r\nalterations that the whole proposition of the recapitulation of the\r\nphylogeny in the ontogeny is erroneous, or at least valueless. If its\r\nonly use were to enable us to read the racial history of a species out\r\nof its germinal history, it is intelligible enough that we might be\r\nled to give it up in despair, but I think that the main thing is to\r\nget some insight into the history of the ontogeny, and there can be\r\nno doubt that this can have been built up on no other foundation than\r\nupon the racial history. What is new could only have arisen from what\r\nwas already in existence, and everything in ontogeny, not only the\r\npalingenetic stages which still represent in some measure the facies of\r\nfully-formed ancestral stages, but also the cœnogenetic stages, like\r\nthe pupa-stage we have already discussed, have arisen historically,\r\nnothing _de novo_, but all in connexion with what was already present.\r\nBut what was first present was in all cases the stages of the ancestral\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly of the greatest value to be able to penetrate more\r\nand more deeply into embryonic development, and to discover more\r\nprecisely the changes that have taken place throughout its course in\r\nthe originally existing material of ancestral forms. But it must not\r\nbe forgotten that, all transformations notwithstanding, so much of\r\nthe racial history is still very plainly indicated in the germinal\r\nhistory, that this must always remain for us a most important source\r\nfrom which to draw conclusions in regard to the phyletic development of\r\nany animal group. I admit that these conclusions have sometimes been\r\ndrawn with too great confidence, but even if we cannot regard as well\r\nfounded Haeckel's view that in the ontogeny of Man there are fourteen\r\ndifferent ancestral stages recognizable, a protist stage, a gastræa\r\nstage, a prochordate, an acranial, a cyclostome, a fish-stage, and so\r\non, we must recognize that the unicellular stage of ontogeny, with\r\nwhich even now the development of every human being begins, undoubtedly\r\nrepeats the facies of an ancestor, although greatly altered; for we\r\nmust be descended from unicellular organisms. The essential part of\r\nthis ancestral stage is thus preserved in the ontogeny, and only what\r\nis special and in some measure due to chance, that is, to adaptation to\r\nspecial conditions of existence, has been modified.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that the proposition that phylogeny is\r\nrecapitulated in the ontogeny is disproved, because the ontogenetic\r\nstage must always contain within it the primordia of the later stages\r\nwhich have been added since the corresponding phylogenetic stage. It\r\nis certain that the egg-cell or the sperm-cell of Man contains, though\r\nin a form not recognizable by us, all the determinants of the perfect\r\nhuman body, but this neither affects its nature as a cell nor its\r\nparticular form as ovum or spermatozoon. It is essentials that are\r\nimportant in this comparison, not accessories. Neither can I agree\r\nwith Hensen's argument when he says that the 'recapitulation-idea' is\r\nerroneous, because the actual course of ontogeny is the 'best and only\r\npossible one,' which, apart from previous history altogether, must of\r\nnecessity be followed. Certainly the actual course is the best, and\r\nunder the given circumstances the only possible one, but that does not\r\nexclude recapitulation, on the contrary it implies it, for ontogeny\r\ncould at no time have arisen from a _tabula rasa_, but only from what\r\nwas historically existent.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to examine each of Haeckel's ancestral stages in\r\nMan's pedigree, or to estimate the degree of probability with which\r\nthey may be deduced from the ontogeny; but that Man's ancestry does,\r\nin a general way, include such a series of phyletic stages may be\r\nadmitted, even if we grant that many of these stages are now no longer\r\nrepresented in the ontogeny as stages of the developing organism as\r\na whole, but only by stages of individual organs or group of organs.\r\nThus it may be disputed whether there is still a fish-stage in\r\nhuman development, but it cannot be disputed that the rudiments of\r\n'gill-arches' and 'gill-clefts,' which are peculiar to one stage of\r\nhuman ontogeny, give us every ground for concluding that we possessed\r\nfish-like ancestors.\r\n\r\nAs we now know that the history of a given mode of embryogenesis\r\nhas involved numerous time-displacements of the organ-rudiments, we\r\nmust attach all the more weight to the developmental history of the\r\nindividual parts and characters, in which the phylogeny can often be\r\nread more clearly than in the stages of the organism as a whole, and we\r\ncan probably find out important laws in this way.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1873 Würtemberger investigated the fossil ammonites with\r\nspecial reference to this point. He was concerned even more at that\r\ntime with finding proofs of the theory of descent in general, and this\r\nwas the first case in which any one succeeded in demonstrating phyletic\r\ntransformation-series of species, deposited one above the other in a\r\ncorresponding series of geological strata, and connected by transition\r\nforms lying between these. In studying this interesting material, of\r\nwhich many examples were at his disposal, Würtemberger proved that the\r\nvariations which had taken place in the spirally coiled shell in the\r\ncourse of ages appeared first on the last whorl, and then subsequently\r\nextended to the one before this, and thence to the still younger whorls\r\nof the shell. Meanwhile the last whorl not infrequently exhibited\r\nanother new character. Thus, for instance, protuberances on the shell\r\nwere shifted in the course of the phylogeny from the last convolution\r\nto the second last, and later to the third last, and so on, while at\r\nthe same time the last convolution showed the protuberance changed into\r\nspines. In other words, the new phyletic acquirements first appeared in\r\nthe mature animal (in the last-formed whorl or chamber of the shell),\r\nbut were subsequently shifted back in the ontogeny to younger stages in\r\nproportion as new transformations of the mature animal appeared. Thus\r\nthere was, so to speak, a retraction of the phyletic acquisitions of\r\nthe mature animal deeper and deeper into the germinal history of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time--in the seventies--I obtained similar results\r\nfrom living species when I was attempting to work out the ontogeny\r\nof the markings on the external skin of the caterpillars of certain\r\nbutterflies, and I should like to submit a short account of these.\r\n\r\nIn one of the early lectures we discussed the protective and defensive\r\ncolours of caterpillars in general, and those of caterpillars of the\r\nSphingidæ in particular. I showed that those naked caterpillars which\r\nlive on plants among the grass, or on the grass itself, are often\r\nnot only green, like fresh grass-stalks, or yellowish-grey, like dry\r\nones, but all the larger forms also exhibit light, usually white,\r\nlongitudinal lines, which, by mimicking the sharp light reflections on\r\nthe grass-stems, heighten the protective resemblance.\r\n\r\nWe also spoke of the light transverse stripes, often marked with pink\r\nor lilac-blue, of many of the large green caterpillars which live\r\non trees and bushes, and whose likeness to the leaves is heightened\r\nby this imitation of the lateral veining of a leaf; and finally we\r\nmentioned the warning coloration indicative of unpleasant or nauseous\r\ntaste, among which must be classed not only vivid contrasts of colour,\r\nbut also specially conspicuous elements of colour such as light\r\nring-spots upon a dark ground. These different colour schemes which\r\nprotect the caterpillars from their enemies are usually only to be\r\nfound in the adolescent caterpillar, not in the very small one which\r\nhas just emerged from the egg, and the development of the markings in\r\nthe individual life clearly shows that the phylogeny of the markings is\r\nmore or less obviously contained in the ontogeny.\r\n\r\nThere are three different schemes of marking which occur in the\r\ncaterpillars of hawk-moths or Sphingidæ--longitudinal striping,\r\nobliquely transverse striping, and spots. Longitudinal striping pure\r\nand unmixed is now found only in a few species, for instance in the\r\ncaterpillar of the _Macroglossa stellatarum_ (Fig. 115), in which a\r\nwhite longitudinal line, beginning at the tip of the tail, runs up each\r\nside of the body to the head as a 'sub-dorsal stripe' (_sbd_). These,\r\nwith other two similar stripes, effectively secure the fairly large\r\ncaterpillar from discovery when it is among grass and herbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115. Caterpillar of the Humming bird Hawk-moth,\r\n_Macroglossa stellatarum_. _sbd_, the sub-dorsal line.]\r\n\r\nTransverse striping occurs as the sole mode of marking in species\r\nwhich live on bushes and trees whose leaves have strong lateral veins,\r\nsuch as willows, poplars, oaks, privet, syringa, and so on, and these\r\nmarkings associated with the leaf-green of their colouring protect them\r\nmost effectively from discovery.\r\n\r\nThe third scheme of marking, namely by spots, occurs in various forms\r\nin species of the genera _Deilephila_ and _Chærocampa_, and it varies\r\nin its biological significance; in many species the spots serve as a\r\nwarning colour, by making the caterpillar conspicuous and easily seen\r\nfrom a distance (_Deilephila galii_, Fig. 117); in others they imitate\r\nthe eyes of a larger animal, and have a 'terrifying' effect, as we have\r\nalready said (Fig. 4); in still other and rarer cases they heighten the\r\nresemblance of the caterpillar to its food-plant by mimicking parts of\r\nit, as, for instance, the red berries of the buckthorn (_Deilephila\r\nhippophaës_, Fig. 8, _r_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3 (repeated). Full-grown caterpillar of the Eyed\r\nHawk-moth, _Smerinthus ocellatus_. _sb_, the sub-dorsal stripe.]\r\n\r\nThus all three modes of marking possess a biological value, and\r\nprotect the soft and easily wounded animal in some way, and, in the\r\ncase of at least two of them, it is clear that they must have arisen\r\nat the very end of the caterpillar's development, since they can only\r\nbe effective as the animal is approaching full size, and would be\r\nvalueless in the very young caterpillar. The transverse striping only\r\nmakes the caterpillar like a leaf when the stripes bear about the same\r\nrelation to each other as those on the leaf, and eye-spots can only\r\nscare away lizards and birds when they are of a certain size. Only\r\nlongitudinal striping is effective as a protection in the case of young\r\ncaterpillars, supposing, that is, that they live in or on the grass\r\n(Fig. 116).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4 (repeated). Full-grown caterpillar of the\r\nElephant Hawk-moth, _Chærocampa elpenor_, in its 'terrifying attitude.']\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8 (repeated). Caterpillars of the Buckthorn\r\nHawk-moth, _Deilephila hippophaës_. _A_, Stage III. _B_, Stage V. _r_,\r\nannular spots.]\r\n\r\nLet us consider the ontogeny of these different forms of markings,\r\nbeginning with the eye-spots. It appears that these develop from a\r\nsub-dorsal stripe, which appears in the young caterpillar in the\r\nsecond stage of its life, and from it, in the course of the further\r\ndevelopment, two pairs of large eye-spots are formed. Even in the\r\nyoung caterpillar, scarcely one centimetre in length (Fig. 116), it\r\ncan be observed that the fine, white sub-dorsal line takes a slight\r\ncurve upwards on the fourth and fifth segments (_C_), and on the\r\nlower edge of these curves a black line is laid down (_D_). This is\r\nthen continued to the upper side (_E_), and encloses the piece of the\r\nsub-dorsal stripe (_F_ and _G_), and thus there arises a white-centred,\r\nblack-framed spot which only requires to grow and to differentiate a\r\nblackish shadow-centre, the pupil (_G_), to give the impression of a\r\nlarge eye. This occurs as the caterpillar goes on growing, and after\r\nthe fourth moult or ecdysis the eyes have already some effect, as the\r\nanimal is six centimetres in length, but they become even more perfect\r\nin the fifth and last stage. During this development of the eye-spot\r\nthe sub-dorsal stripe disappears completely from the greater part of\r\nthe caterpillar, persisting only on the first three segments (Fig. 116,\r\n_B-F_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116. Development of the eye-spots in the\r\ncaterpillar of the Elephant Hawk-moth (_Chærocampa elpenor_). _A_,\r\nStage I, still without marking, simply green. _B_, Stage II, with\r\nsub-dorsal stripe (_sbd_). _C_, sub-dorsal line somewhat later, with\r\nthe first hint of the eye-spot (_Au_) on segments 4 and 5. _D_,\r\neye-spots in Stage III of the caterpillar, somewhat further developed\r\nthan in _E_, the third stage. _F_, Stage IV. _G_, the anterior eye-spot\r\nat the same stage.]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that this stripe in the little caterpillar a\r\ncentimetre long, which lives on the large leaves of the vine, or on\r\nthe obliquely ribbed willow-herb (_Epilobium hirsutum_), is quite\r\nwithout protective value, its occurrence at that stage can only be\r\nregarded as a phyletic reminiscence due to the fact that the ancestors\r\nof these species of _Chærocampa_ possessed longitudinal stripes in the\r\nadult state, probably because at that time they lived on plants among\r\nthe grass, and that, later, when the species changed their habitat to\r\nplants with broad leaves which had arisen in the meantime, eye-spots\r\nwere developed in addition to the green or brown protective colouring\r\nwhich they retained. Thus the modern development of these spots mirrors\r\ntheir phyletic evolution very faithfully; on the two segments there\r\nwere formed, from pieces of the sub-dorsal line, first white spots\r\nringed round with black, then unmistakeable eyes with pupils (_C_, _D_,\r\n_G_). This transformation can only have begun in the fairly well-grown\r\ncaterpillar, because it was only of any use to it; but later on it was\r\nshunted further back in the ontogeny, from the sixth and fifth to the\r\nfourth and third caterpillar stage, not in its complete development,\r\nbut in more and more incipient form; and nowadays the first traces of\r\neyes, as we have already seen, are visible in the course of the second\r\nstage. The marking of the more remote ancestors, the longitudinal\r\nstriping, is now lost in proportion as the eye-spots develop, perhaps\r\nbecause the former would take away from the full effect of the latter.\r\nThe longitudinal stripes are still quite plainly visible on the first\r\nthree segments, but these segments are drawn in and are scarcely\r\nnoticeable when the caterpillar assumes a defiant attitude (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\nIn the case of marking with ring-spots, which is found especially in\r\nspecies of the genus _Deilephila_, the ontogeny discloses that it has\r\ndeveloped phyletically from the sub-dorsal stripe; in the young stage\r\nof this caterpillar also, the sole marking is longitudinal striping;\r\nin _Deilephila zygophylli_, from the steppes of Southern Russia,\r\nthis persists apparently through all the stages, but in the others\r\nit disappears almost completely in the later stages, but only on the\r\nsegments on which the spot-marking has developed from it. This happens\r\nin a manner similar to that in which the eye-spot in _Chærocampa_\r\narises, a piece of the white sub-dorsal stripe is enclosed above and\r\nbelow by a semicircle of black, and later these semicircles unite, and\r\ncut off the portion of the sub-dorsal line, and form a black spot with\r\na light centre within which a red spot frequently appears (Fig. 117,\r\n_A_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117. Caterpillar of the Bed-straw Hawk-moth\r\n(_Deilephila galii_). _A_, Stage IV, sub-dorsal stripe still distinct,\r\nthe annular spots are still incompletely enclosed in it. _B_,\r\nfully-formed caterpillar without trace of a sub-dorsal stripe, but with\r\nten annular spots.]\r\n\r\nIn most species these ring-spots occur on many segments (10-12) (Fig.\r\n117, _B_), and in cases where they are of importance in making the\r\ncaterpillar conspicuous and easily seen they sometimes form a double\r\nrow. But we know one species, _Deilephila hippophaës_, in which only\r\na single ring-spot exists, and it is a large brick-red spot on the\r\nsecond last segment, mimicking the red berry of the buckthorn (Fig.\r\n8, _A_ and _B_, _r_). But individuals also occur in which there are,\r\non the five or six segments in front, smaller ring-spots which become\r\nless distinct the further forward they are, and in most caterpillars\r\nit is possible, on careful examination, to recognize little red dots\r\non the faded sub-dorsal stripes of these segments (Fig. 8, _B_). We\r\nmight be disposed to think, on this account, that the ancestors of\r\n_D. hippophaës_ bore rings on all the segments, and that these had\r\ngradually become vestigial on the majority of them, because they had\r\nlost their earlier biological importance, and now, by adaptation to the\r\nbuckthorn, could only be of use on the second last. But when we take\r\nthe ontogeny also into account we find in the young caterpillar only a\r\nsimple sub-dorsal line, upon which, in the third stage, the red spot of\r\nthe tail-horn segment appears (Fig. 8, _A_).\r\n\r\nNo spots ever occur on the other segments at this stage; they only\r\nappear in the last stage, but as they may be entirely wanting, they\r\nmust have arisen as the result of internal laws of correlation, that\r\nis, they must be recapitulations of the hindmost spots which arose\r\nin the phylogeny through natural selection. We may conclude this, at\r\nleast, if we believe in the truth of the fundamental proposition of the\r\nbiogenetic law, and admit that there is in the ontogeny some more or\r\nless distinct recapitulation of the phylogeny.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118. Two stages in the life-history of the Spurge\r\nHawk-moth (_Deilephila euphorbiæ_). _A_, first stage, the caterpillar\r\ndark blackish-green, without marking. _B_, second stage, the row of\r\nspots is distinctly connected by a light streak, the vestige of the\r\nsub-dorsal stripe.]\r\n\r\nThis proposition may be recognized as true in the case of _Deilephila_\r\nalso, if we compare the different species with one another as regards\r\ntheir ontogeny. We find here too that not only the sub-dorsal, that is,\r\nthe phyletically oldest marking of the Sphingid caterpillars, occurs\r\neverywhere in the young stages, but also that it is being shunted back\r\nto younger and younger stages, in proportion to the degree of the\r\ndevelopment of the spot-marking reached in the full-grown caterpillar.\r\nThus, for instance, in the caterpillar of _Deilephila euphorbiæ_ the\r\nhighest form of spot-marking is reached, and in this species the\r\nsub-dorsal line is no longer the sole marking element at any stage.\r\nLeaving out of the question the absolutely unmarked little caterpillar\r\nwhich emerges from the egg (Fig. 118, _A_), there appears at once in\r\nthe second stage a series of ring-spots connected by a fine white\r\nsub-dorsal line (Fig. 118, _B_). In the following stage, the third,\r\nthis sub-dorsal line disappears without leaving a trace, and there\r\nremains only the spot-marking, which is subsequently duplicated.\r\n\r\nLet us compare with this the ontogeny of the bed-straw hawk-moth,\r\n_Deilephila galii_ (Fig. 117). The full-grown caterpillar possesses\r\nonly a single row of ring-spots (_B_), and accordingly the young stages\r\nof the caterpillar up to the fourth show a distinct sub-dorsal line\r\n(_A_), although spots are seen upon it. A still earlier phyletic stage\r\nof development is illustrated by _Deilephila livornica_, in which the\r\nring-spots are all connected by the sub-dorsal line.\r\n\r\nIt can thus hardly be doubted that the biogenetic law is guiding us\r\naright when we conclude from a comparison of the ontogeny of the\r\ndifferent species of _Deilephila_, that the oldest ancestors of the\r\ngenus possessed only the longitudinal stripes, and that from these\r\nsmall pieces were cut off as ring-spots, and that these were gradually\r\nperfected and ultimately duplicated, while at the same time the\r\noriginal marking, the longitudinal stripe, was shunted back further and\r\nfurther in the young stages, until it finally disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\nLet us now refer for a moment to the third form of marking in the\r\ncaterpillars of the Sphingidæ--transverse striping. This has not arisen\r\nout of the sub-dorsal line, but quite independently and at a later\r\ndate. This is proved with great certainty by the ontogeny of species\r\nof the genus _Smerinthus_. The full-grown, and usually also the young\r\ncaterpillars, of these species have quite regularly the seven broad\r\noblique stripes which run in the direction of the tail-horn at equal\r\nintervals on the lateral surfaces of the body (Fig. 3). They are\r\nabsent only from the three anterior segments, and upon these a part\r\nof the older marking, the sub-dorsal stripe, has persisted. But we\r\nfind this fully developed in the youngest stages of other species. In\r\n_Smerinthus populi_, the little caterpillar, which has no markings at\r\nall when it leaves the egg, very soon shows the white sub-dorsal line,\r\nand simultaneously with it the seven transverse stripes, which cut\r\nobliquely through it; in the older caterpillars the sub-dorsal then\r\ndisappears (Fig. 119).\r\n\r\nWhen I was investigating these matters at the beginning of the\r\nseventies I did not succeed in procuring eggs of the species of the\r\ngenus _Sphinx_, which likewise almost all exhibit the oblique striping\r\nin their full-grown stages. But from what I knew of the ontogeny of\r\n_Smerinthus_ species I was able to predict that, among the young\r\nstages of _Sphinx_, there must be some with sub-dorsal lines. This\r\nwas confirmed later, for Poulton found in _Sphinx convolvuli_ that in\r\nthe first stage there are no oblique stripes, but only the sub-dorsal\r\nstripe, while in _Sphinx ligustri_ both kinds of marking were present\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119. Caterpillar of _Smerinthus populi_, the Poplar\r\nHawk-moth, at the end of the first stage, showing both the complete\r\nsub-dorsal stripe and the oblique stripes.]\r\n\r\nFrom all these facts, which I have summarized as briefly as possible,\r\nwe see that the older phyletic characters are gradually crowded by the\r\nnewer into ever-younger stages in the ontogeny, until ultimately they\r\ndisappear altogether. We have now to ask to what this phenomenon is\r\ndue; is it a simple crowding out of the old and less advantageous by\r\nthe new and better characters as a result of natural selection, or is\r\nthere some other factor at work? It is clear in regard to these forms\r\nof marking that they can have been developed at first only in the\r\nalmost full-grown larva by natural selection, because they are of use\r\nonly there, and that, at the same time, the old marking must have been\r\nset aside through the influence of the same factor, in as far as it\r\nprejudiced the effect of the new adaptation. This seems to be indicated\r\nby the persistence of the sub-dorsal line on those segments which are\r\ndrawn in when _Chærocampa_ assumes a terrifying attitude, or which do\r\nnot bear oblique stripes in the leaf-like caterpillars, e.g. the three\r\nanterior segments in the species of _Sphinx_ and _Smerinthus_. When\r\nnewly acquired schemes of marking like the eye-spots of _Chærocampa_\r\nare transmitted from the last stage to the stage before, this can be\r\nexplained by following the same train of thought, for the caterpillar\r\nis already of sufficient size to be able to inspire terror with its\r\neyes; but in still younger stages the spots would not be likely to\r\nhave that effect, and yet they occur in quite small animals (20 mm.).\r\nMore obvious still is the uselessness of the oblique striping in the\r\nyoung stages of the _Sphinx_ and _Smerinthus_ caterpillars, for in the\r\nearliest stages of life the caterpillars are much too small to look\r\nlike a leaf, and the oblique stripes stand much closer together than\r\nthe lateral ribs of any leaf. Moreover, the little green caterpillars\r\nrequire no further protection when they sit on the under side of a\r\nleaf; they might then very easily be mistaken _in toto_ for a leaf-rib.\r\n_Thus it is certainly not natural selection which effects the shunting\r\nback of the new characters._ Nor can this be caused by the fact that\r\nthe new character can only be developed gradually and in several\r\nstages, for the oblique striping at any rate arises in the ontogeny all\r\nat once. There must therefore be some mechanical factor in development\r\nto which is due the fact that characters acquired in the later stages\r\nare gradually transferred to the younger stages. But this shifting\r\nbackwards can be checked by the agency of natural selection as soon as\r\nit becomes disadvantageous for the stage concerned.\r\n\r\nIt is in this way that I explain the fact that the majority of the\r\ncaterpillars of the Sphingidæ are absolutely without markings when\r\nthey emerge from the egg. Thus, for instance, the caterpillars of\r\n_Chærocampa_ (Fig. 116, _A_), of _Macroglossa_ (Fig. 115), and of\r\n_Deilephila_ (Fig. 118, _A_), as well as those of the _Smerinthus_\r\nspecies, are at first without stripe or mark of any kind; they are\r\nof a pale green colour, almost transparent, and very difficult to\r\nrecognize when they sit upon a leaf. How very greatly the different\r\nstages _can be_ independently adapted to the different conditions of\r\ntheir life, when that is necessary for the preservation of the species,\r\nis shown in the most striking manner by many species. Thus the little\r\ngreen caterpillar of _Aglia tau_, when it leaves the egg, bears five\r\nremarkable reddish rod-like thorns, which in form and colour resemble\r\nthe bud-scales of the young beech-buds among which they live, and which\r\ndisappear later on; the full-grown caterpillar shows nothing of these,\r\nbut is leaf-green, marked with oblique stripes. Even if the use of\r\nthese reddish thorns be other than I have indicated, we have in any\r\ncase to deal with a special adaptation of _one_, and that the first\r\ncaterpillar-stage, and what can happen at this stage is possible also\r\nat every other. Nor is it only animals which undergo metamorphosis that\r\ncan exhibit independent phyletic variation at every stage, but those\r\nalso with direct development, and indeed, in the case of these, we may\r\nassume adaptation of this kind at almost every stage in the history\r\nof the organs, as we have already seen, because the great abridgement\r\nof the phylogeny into the ontogeny necessitates a very precise\r\nmutual adaptation of the organ-rudiments and of the diverse rates of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nWe have thus been led by the facts discussed--and numerous others\r\nfrom other groups in the animal kingdom might be ranked along with\r\nthem--to two main propositions, which express the relation of phylogeny\r\nto ontogeny. The first and fundamental proposition is the one already\r\nformulated. The ontogeny arises from the phylogeny by a condensation of\r\nits stages, which may be varied, shortened, thrown out, or compressed\r\nby the interpolation of new stages. The second proposition refers to\r\nindividual parts, and may run as follows: As each stage can undergo\r\nnew adaptations by itself, so can every part, every organ; such new\r\nadaptations very often show a tendency to be transferred to the\r\nimmediately antecedent stage in ontogeny.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to formulate the laws of ontogeny just now,\r\notherwise many others might be added to these, such as that of the\r\nregular transference of characters acquired at one end of a segmented\r\nanimal to the other segments: I must confine myself here to bringing\r\nthe two main propositions into harmony with the principles of our\r\ntheory of heredity.\r\n\r\nHow phylogeny is condensed in ontogeny can be understood readily\r\nenough in a general way, although we cannot profess to have any\r\ninsight into the detailed processes. The continuity of the germ-plasm\r\nbrings about inheritance, in that it is continually handing over to\r\nthe germ-plasm of the next generation the determinant-complex of the\r\npreceding one. Every new adaptation at any stage whatever depends\r\non the variation of particular determinants within the germ-plasm,\r\nand this in its turn depends on germinal selection, that is, on the\r\nstruggle of the different determinant-variants among themselves, and\r\non the variation in a definite direction which arises from this, as\r\nwe have already shown. A new kind of determinant can never arise of\r\nitself, but always only from already existing determinants, and through\r\nvariation of these. But as spontaneous variation never causes all the\r\nhomologous determinants of a germ-plasm to vary in quite the same way,\r\nbut only a majority of them, there always remains a minority of the\r\nold determinants, which may, under certain circumstances, predominate\r\nagain, as is proved by the aberrations in _Vanessa_ species due to\r\ncold, and by many other kinds of reversion.\r\n\r\nBut it is not this variation which leads to the prolongation of\r\nontogeny, and the repetition of the phyletic stages within it. In this\r\ncase it is rather that a new character takes the place of an old one,\r\nnot that it is added to it. A black spot may arise instead of a red\r\none, but not first a black spot and then a red one. Of course we still\r\nknow far too little in regard to the intimate succession of events in\r\nthe stages of ontogeny to be able to say definitely that, in such\r\napparently simple transformations, the older stage does not, in every\r\nontogeny, precede the more recent one as a preparation for it, though\r\nit may be only for a brief and transient period.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, however, that variations such as the addition of a new\r\nstage in ontogeny are undergone, and that this implies the occurrence\r\nof something really quite new. Therefore such a new stage can arise\r\nonly from the germ-plasm, by the duplication, and in part variation, of\r\nthe determinants of the preceding stage. If, for instance, the body of\r\na Crustacean be lengthened by a segment, this must be due to a process\r\nof this kind, and in such a case it is intelligible enough that the new\r\nsegment can be formed in the ontogeny only after the development of the\r\nolder preceding one, for its determinants come from that, and are from\r\nthe beginning so arranged that they are only liberated to activity by\r\nthe formation of the preceding segment.\r\n\r\nNow, if in the course of the phylogeny numerous new segments were\r\nadded to the body of the Crustacean, the ontogeny would be materially\r\nprolonged, and condensation would become necessary in the interests of\r\nspecies-preservation. To bring this condensation about, whole series of\r\nsegments which were added successively in the phylogeny succeeded each\r\nother with gradually increasing rapidity in the ontogeny, until finally\r\nthey appeared _simultaneously_: the determinants of the segments _n_,\r\n_n_ + 1, _n_ + 2, ... _n_ + _x_ varied in regard to their liberating\r\nstimuli, and were roused to activity no longer successively, but\r\nsimultaneously, in the cell complexes controlled by them. We have thus\r\nrecapitulation, but with abridgement and compression, of the phyletic\r\nstages in the ontogeny. Thus in the nauplius of _Leptodora_ we see the\r\nrudiments of five of the pairs of legs of the subsequent thorax (Fig.\r\n111, _IV-VIII_), and in the Zoæa larva the rudiments of six thoracic\r\nlegs may be seen behind the already developed swimming-leg (Fig. 114,\r\n_VI-XIII_).\r\n\r\nBut in the course of the phylogeny a segment may also become\r\nsuperfluous, and we know that it then degenerates and is ultimately\r\neliminated altogether. Thus in a parasitic Isopod, which lives\r\nwithin other Crustaceans, a segment of the thorax is wanting in the\r\nrelatively well-developed larva, and in the Caprellidæ among the\r\nAmphipod Crustaceans the whole abdomen of from six to seven segments\r\nhas degenerated to a narrow, rudimentary structure. In such cases\r\nthe gradual degeneration of the relative determinants has preceded\r\nstep for step the degeneration of the part itself, and when this is\r\ncomplete the ontogeny shows nothing of what was previously present,\r\nand so we may speak of a 'falsification' of the phylogeny. But that\r\nthe complete disappearance of the determinants only comes about with\r\nextreme slowness, so that whole geological periods are sometimes not\r\nenough for its accomplishment, we have already learnt from our study\r\nof rudimentary organs, instances of which can be demonstrated in every\r\nhigher animal, bearing witness to the presence of the relevant organs\r\nor structures in the ancestors of the species.\r\n\r\nWe can infer with certainty, from the observational data at our\r\ndisposal, that the disappearance of useless parts is regulated by\r\ndefinite laws; but it is too soon to attempt to formulate these laws,\r\nor even to trace them back to their mechanical causes. As we have\r\nalready said, a much more comprehensive collection of facts, and\r\nabove all one which has been made on a definite plan, is a necessary\r\npreliminary condition to this. But so much at least we may gather\r\nfrom the facts before us, that the degeneration of an organ begins\r\nat the final stage, and is transferred gradually backwards into the\r\nembryogenesis. Thus the two fingers of birds which have disappeared\r\nsince Cretaceous times are still indicated in every bird-embryo,\r\nthough they subsequently degenerate. In various mammals 'pre-lacteal\r\ntooth-germs' have been demonstrated in the jaws of embryos, which show\r\nus that not only did ancestors exist whose dentition was the modern\r\n'milk-teeth,' but that still more remote ancestors possessed another\r\nset of teeth, which was crowded out by the 'milk-teeth'; thus the teeth\r\nof the ancestors of the modern right whale (_Balæna mysticetus_) are\r\nonly represented in the embryo of to-day in the form of dental pits.\r\nAnd, as we saw already, the Os centrale so characteristic of the wrist\r\nof lower vertebrates only appears in Man at a very early embryonic\r\nstage, and disappears again as such in the further course of the\r\nembryogenesis.\r\n\r\nWe may perhaps give a preliminary statement of this law as follows: It\r\nis impossible that any part or organ should be removed suddenly from\r\nthe ontogeny without bringing the whole into disorder, and the least\r\nserious disturbance of the course of development will undoubtedly be\r\ncaused if the final stage of the part in question become rudimentary\r\nfirst. Only after this has happened, and the neighbouring parts have\r\nadapted themselves to the disappearance, can this extend to the stages\r\nimmediately preceding it, so that these too degenerate, and allow\r\nthe surrounding parts to adapt themselves. The further back into the\r\nontogeny the disappearance extends the greater will be the number of\r\nother structures affected in some way or other by the degeneration, and\r\nthese must not all be brought suddenly into new conditions, else the\r\nwhole course of development would suffer. Thus at first only those\r\ndeterminants may disappear--and can disappear according to the laws\r\nof germinal selection--which control the final form of the useless\r\norgan, then those just preceding them, which controlled, let us say,\r\nits size, and thus more and more of the previously active determinants\r\ndisappear, and hand in hand with this disappearance there is variation\r\nof all the parts correlated with the dwindling condition of the organ,\r\nso that their own development and that of the animal as a whole suffers\r\nno injury. If it were otherwise, if when a part became useless its\r\ncollective determinants were all to disappear at the same time, the\r\nwhole ontogeny would totter, in fact it would be much as if a man who\r\nwished to remove the breadth of a window from a house standing on\r\npillars were to begin by taking away the foundation pillar.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, to be understood that these processes go on so\r\nexceedingly slowly that personal selection takes a share in them, at\r\nleast at the beginning. Later on, the further degeneration of a useless\r\norgan or rudiment has no effect on the individual's power of life, and\r\ntherefore depends solely upon the struggle of the parts within the\r\ngerm-plasm (germinal selection).\r\n\r\nIf we could see the determinants, and recognize directly their\r\narrangement in the germ-plasm and their importance in ontogeny, we\r\nshould doubtless understand many of the phenomena of ontogeny and their\r\nrelation to phylogeny which must otherwise remain a riddle, or demand\r\naccessory hypotheses for their interpretation. Several years ago Emery\r\nrightly pointed out that the phenomena of the variation of homologous\r\nparts might be inferred by reasoning from the germ-plasm theory. If\r\none hand has six fingers instead of five, it not infrequently happens\r\nthat the other also exhibits a superfluity of fingers, and sometimes\r\nthe foot does so too. The phyletic modification of the limbs in the\r\nUngulates has taken place with striking uniformity in the fore and\r\nhind extremities; no animal has ever been one-hoofed in front and\r\ntwo-hoofed behind. Although I might suggest that this primarily depends\r\non adaptation to different conditions of the ground, and that the\r\nArtiodactyls were evolved in relation to the soft marshy soil of the\r\nforest, and the Perissodactyls for the steppes, it cannot be denied\r\nthat germinal conditions may have co-operated in bringing about this\r\nuniformity of the direction of variation, especially as the whole\r\nstructure of the fore- and hind-limbs exhibits such marked similarity.\r\nEmery is inclined to refer this to 'germ-plasmic correlations,' and\r\nwe have assumed from the very first that the different determinants\r\nand groups of determinants do indeed stand in definite and close\r\nrelations to one another. But it seems to me premature to say anything\r\nmore precise and definite than that in the meantime. I should like,\r\nhowever, to say that determinants or groups of determinants which\r\nhad in old ancestral germ-plasms to give rise to a series of quite\r\nsimilar structures by multiplication during the ontogeny, and therefore\r\nonly needed to be present _singly_ in the germ-plasm, would, in\r\nlater descendants, have to shift their multiplication back into the\r\ngerm-plasm itself, if necessity required that the homologous parts\r\nwhich they controlled should become _different_ from each other.\r\nThen the previously single group of determinants in the germ-plasm\r\nwould have to become multiple. But as new determinants can only arise\r\nfrom those which already exist, these new ones must have had their\r\nplace beside the old, and would therefore probably be exposed to\r\nany intra-germinal causes of variation in common with them--that is\r\nto say, they will tend to vary even later in a similar manner. For\r\ninstance, we might think of the segments of primitive Annelids, which\r\nin form and contents are for the most part alike, as arising from one\r\ngerm-rudiment, from which, when, in the higher Annelids, the various\r\nregions of the body had to take a different form, several primary\r\nconstituents of the germ-plasm separated themselves off; and in a\r\nsimilar way the much higher and more complex differentiation of the\r\nsomatic segments in the Crustaceans must have been brought about. Thus\r\nwe understand how the determinant groups of the germ-plasm multiplied\r\naccording to the need for increasing differentiation, but remained in\r\nintimate relation, which exposed them in some measure to a common fate,\r\nthat is, to common modifying influences, and in many cases determined\r\nthem to similar variation.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot see directly into the germ-plasm, and are therefore\r\nthrown back on the inductions we can make from the facts presented\r\nto us by the phenomena of visible living organisms. As yet the\r\nmaterial for such inductions is scanty, because it has been got\r\ntogether haphazard, and not collected on a definite plan. I therefore\r\nrefrain for the present from attempting any further elaboration of\r\nmy germ-plasm theory. It is only when an abundance of observation\r\nmaterial, collected according to a definite plan, lies at our disposal\r\nthat anything more in regard to the intimate structure of the\r\ngerm-plasm, or the mutual influences and relations of its determinants\r\nand its modification in the course of phylogeny can be deduced with\r\nany certainty. Meanwhile, we must content ourselves with having,\r\nthrough the hypothesis of determinants, made intelligible at least\r\nthe one fundamental fact, how it is possible that in the course of\r\nthe phylogeny single parts and single stages can be thrown out or\r\ninterpolated, or even only caused to vary, without giving rise to\r\nvariation in all the rest of the parts and stages of the animal.\r\nA theory of epigenesis cannot do this, for, if no representative\r\nparticles were contained in the germ-plasm, then every variation of\r\nit would affect the whole course of development and every part of the\r\norganism, and variations of individual parts arising from the germ\r\nwould be impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE OF AMPHIMIXIS\r\n\r\n Twofold import of amphimixis--It conditions the continual changing\r\n of individuality--Analogy from game of cards--The germ-plasm is at\r\n once variable and persistent--The two roots of individual variation:\r\n germinal selection and new combinations of the ids--'Harmonious'\r\n adaptation conditions amphimixis--Difference between adaptation\r\n and mere variation--Is a 'direct' use of amphimixis to be insisted\r\n upon?--Ceaseless intervention of personal selection in the lineage of\r\n the germ-plasm--Far-reaching effects of personal selection--Fixing\r\n of the arrangements for amphimixis in the course of generations\r\n of species--Increase of the constancy of a character with its\r\n duration--Characters in the same species variable in different\r\n degrees--The upper and under surfaces of Kallima--Wild plants brought\r\n under cultivation do not at first vary--Amphimixis very ancient,\r\n therefore very firmly established--Does amphimixis bring about\r\n equalization (Hatschek, Haycraft, Quetelet)?--Galton's frequency\r\n curves--Ammon's free scope for variations--De Vries' asymetrical\r\n curves of frequency.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already made ourselves familiar with the process which in\r\nunicellular organisms is called conjugation and in multicellular\r\norganisms fertilization, and we have seen that its most obvious\r\nsignificance lay in the fact that through it the germ-plasms of two\r\nindividuals are united. Since, according to our view, this germ-plasm\r\nor idioplasm is the bearer of the hereditary tendencies of the\r\norganism concerned, the mingling or amphimixis of two germ-plasms\r\nbrings together the hereditary tendencies of two individuals, and the\r\norganism whose development is derived from this mingled germ-plasm\r\nmust therefore exhibit traits of both parents, and must to a certain\r\nextent be made up of the traits of both. This is one result attained by\r\namphimixis.\r\n\r\nBut we went further than this, and saw that there is a second result\r\nimplied in amphimixis, namely, that the individual character of\r\nthe germ-plasm is being continually altered by new combinations of\r\nthe ids contained in it. We inferred from what I believe to be the\r\ndemonstrated hypothesis that the germ-plasm is composed of ids, that\r\nits reduction to half the original mass must mean a reduction of the\r\nids to half the number, and as the ids contain primary constituents\r\nwhich are individually different, this must effect a new arrangement,\r\na new mingling of these individual peculiarities. The reduction of the\r\ngerm-plasm to half, that is, the diminution of the number of its ids\r\nto half, is a phenomenon generally associated with amphimixis, and\r\nhas been established in the case of all animals which have hitherto\r\nbeen investigated, and of all the most carefully studied plants,\r\nand finally, it has been shown to be very probable in unicellular\r\norganisms, for the processes of conjugation in Infusorians and many\r\nother Protozoa include phenomena very similar to those of reducing\r\ndivision in the higher animals. The prediction made on theoretical\r\ngrounds has here been verified by observation, and it is obvious that\r\nthe assumption of ids, that is, of units in the germ-plasm which\r\nare handed on from one generation to the succeeding one, involves a\r\nreduction of their number in each amphimixis. Without this the number\r\nof ids would be doubled at each amphimixis, and would therefore\r\ngradually amount to something enormous. We see therefore why this\r\nnormally recurrent reduction of ids before each amphimixis was\r\nestablished in the course of evolution, and we see that it inevitably\r\ninvolves that a new combination of ids should be associated with each\r\namphimixis.\r\n\r\nIf nothing persists unless it be purposeful, that is, necessary, what\r\nis the meaning of the fact that arrangements for amphimixis occur over\r\nalmost the whole known domain of life, from the very simple organisms\r\nup to the highest, in unicellular and multicellular organisms, in\r\nplants and animals alike? Why is it that this arrangement has been\r\ndeparted from only in a few small groups of forms, while it occurs\r\neverywhere else, in almost every generation, so indissolubly associated\r\nwith reproduction that it has even been regarded--with a lack of\r\nclearness--as itself a form of reproduction, and is even now generally\r\ncalled 'sexual reproduction'? And why is it that in many organisms,\r\nespecially lowly ones, it is not associated with every reproduction,\r\nthough it recurs at regular or irregular intervals? Such a universal\r\narrangement must undoubtedly be of fundamental importance, and we\r\nhave to ask wherein this importance lies. That is the problem to the\r\nsolution of which we must now apply ourselves.\r\n\r\nSo much we may say at once: The significance of amphimixis cannot be\r\nthat of making multiplication possible, for multiplication may be\r\neffected without amphimixis in the most diverse ways--by division of\r\nthe organism into two or more, by budding, and even by the production\r\nof unicellular germs. Even though these last are usually in various\r\nways so organized that they must undergo amphimixis before they can\r\ndevelop into new organisms, yet there are numerous germ-cells which\r\nare not subject to this condition (e.g. spores), and there are--as we\r\nhave seen--many germ-cells, adapted for amphimixis, which always, or in\r\ncertain generations, or even only occasionally, emancipate themselves\r\nfrom this condition under certain external influences: I refer to\r\negg-cells which develop parthenogenetically.\r\n\r\nIf amphimixis is not a universal preliminary condition of reproduction,\r\nwherein lies the necessity for its general occurrence among living\r\norganisms?\r\n\r\nWe have already learned that there are two results produced without\r\nexception by amphimixis; one of these is the antecedent reduction\r\nof the original number of ids by one half, and the consequent new\r\ncombination of ids which results from this; the other is the union\r\nof two such halved germ-plasms from two different individuals. The\r\nfirst we may, with Hartog, compare to the removal of half of a pack\r\nof cards previously mixed, the second to the combination of two\r\nsuch halves from different packs. The first process brings nothing\r\nnew into the complex of primary constituents, but rather removes a\r\npart--larger or smaller--of its characters: not necessarily exactly\r\nhalf of these, since each individual kind of id may be represented by\r\ndoubles or multiples. But the reduction simplifies the composition\r\nof the germ-plasm, and might by itself, through the struggle of the\r\nids in ontogeny, lead to a resultant different from the parent, that\r\nis, to a new individuality. Through the second process, however, new\r\nindividual traits are of necessity added, and make the resultants still\r\nmore markedly diverse, that is, if the ids of both parents attain to\r\nexpression in the struggle of ontogeny, and this, as we have already\r\nseen, is usually the case, though not always and certainly not always\r\nin all parts. Thus amphimixis, together with the preparatory reduction\r\nof the ids, secures the constant recurrence of individual peculiarities\r\nthrough the ceaseless new combinations of individual characters already\r\nexisting in the species.\r\n\r\nWhen sixteen years ago I first inquired into the actual and ultimate\r\nsignificance of sexual reproduction, I thought I had found it in\r\nthis ceaseless production of new individualities. This seemed to me\r\na sufficient reason for the introduction of amphimixis into nature,\r\nsince the difference between individuals is the basis of the process\r\nof selection, and thus the basis of all the transformations of\r\norganisms, which we may refer to natural or sexual selection. Now\r\nthese differences of selection-value are--as I believed then, and do\r\nstill--not only by far the most frequent organic changes, but also the\r\nmost important, since they not only initiate, but control new lines of\r\nevolution. Therefore I still regard amphimixis as the means by which a\r\ncontinual new combination of variations is effected a process without\r\nwhich the evolution of this world of organisms so endlessly diverse in\r\nform and so inconceivably complex, could not have taken place.\r\n\r\nBut I do not regard this amphimixis as the real root of variation\r\nitself, for that must depend not on a mere exchange of ids, but rather\r\nupon a variation of the ids. The ids of a worm of the primitive\r\nworld could not without variation now make up the germ-plasm of an\r\nelephant, even if it be true that mammals are descended from worms.\r\nThe ids must have been meanwhile transformed times without number by\r\nthe modification, degeneration, and new formation of determinants.\r\nAmphimixis, that is, the union of two germ-plasms, does not of itself\r\ncause variation of the determinants, it only arranges the ids (the\r\nancestral plasms) in ever-new combinations. If the origin of variation\r\nwere limited to that alone, a transmutation of species and genera\r\nwould only be possible on a very limited scale; there could at most be\r\na narrow circle of variations, just as in the example already given\r\nof the packs of cards; even if the taking away and mixing up of the\r\nhalves were repeated a thousand times, a definite though undoubtedly\r\nlarge number of card-combinations would in the long run recur again and\r\nagain. But the case is different with the germ-plasm and amphimixis,\r\nwhere there is an infinitely more varied series of results, because\r\nthe individual cards--the ids--are variable, even between one time of\r\nsifting and shuffling and another, and therefore infinitely productive\r\nof variety in the course of numerous repetitions of the shuffling.\r\n\r\nI have been frequently and persistently credited with maintaining that\r\nthe germ-plasm is invariable--a misunderstanding of my position, due\r\nperhaps to a somewhat too brief and terse statement which I made at an\r\nearlier period (1886). I had described the germ-plasm as 'a substance\r\nof great power of persistence,' and as varying with difficulty and\r\nslowly, basing this statement upon the age-long persistence of many\r\nspecies in which the specific constitution of the germ-plasm must have\r\nremained unchanged. The idea of 'germinal selection,' of a ceaseless\r\nstruggle between the 'primary constituents' of the germ, and of\r\nthe resulting continual slight and invisible rising and falling of\r\nindividual characters, had not yet dawned upon me, nor had I at that\r\ntime formulated the conception of 'determinants.' I was even doubtful\r\nat that time whether development, heredity, and variation were not\r\ninterpretable on the assumption of an undifferentiated substance\r\nwithout primary constituents. But at no time was I unaware that the\r\nwhole phyletic evolution of the organic world is only conceivable\r\non the assumption of continual variation of the germ-plasm, that it\r\nactually depends upon this, even if these variations come about with\r\nexceeding slowness, and are thus in a certain sense 'difficult.'\r\n\r\nNow that I understand these processes more clearly, my opinion is\r\nthat the roots of all heritable variation lie in the germ-plasm,\r\nand furthermore, that the determinants are continually oscillating\r\nhither and thither in response to very minute nutritive changes, and\r\nare readily compelled to _variation in a definite direction_, which\r\nmay ultimately lead to considerable variations in the structure of\r\nthe species, if they are favoured by personal selection, or at least\r\nif they are not suppressed by it as prejudicial. But selection is\r\ncontinually keeping watch over both kinds of variation, and if the\r\nconditions of life do not further the variation or do not even allow it\r\nto persist, selection eliminates everything that lessens the purity of\r\nthe specific type, everything that transgresses the limits of utility,\r\nor that might endanger the existence of the species. Thus we understand\r\nhow the germ-plasm may be variable, and yet at the same time remain\r\nunvaried for thousands of years, how it is ready and able to furnish\r\nany variation that is possible in a species if that is required by\r\nexternal circumstances, and yet is able to preserve the characters of\r\nthe species in almost absolute constancy through whole geological ages;\r\nin short, how it can be at once readily variable and yet slow to vary.\r\n\r\nThe importance which amphimixis thus has in connexion with the\r\nadaptation of organisms lies, if I mistake not, in the necessity\r\nfor co-adaptation, that is, in the fact that in almost all\r\nadaptations it is not merely a question of the variation of a single\r\ndeterminant, but of the correlated variations of many--often very\r\nnumerous--determinants, of 'harmonious adaptation,' as we have already\r\nsaid. Many-sided adaptation of this kind seems to me impossible without\r\na continually recurrent sifting and recombining of the germ-plasms, and\r\nthis can only be effected by amphimixis.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that, apart from amphimixis, variation can be\r\nbrought about in many parts of an organism, as in purely asexual\r\nreproduction. A plant, for instance, may vary when it is transferred\r\nto a strange soil or climate; and even in that case the variations\r\nseem to be harmonious, at least the harmony of the parts is so far\r\nmaintained that the plant continues to flourish, at any rate under\r\ncultivation. A plant species may be incited by abundant nourishment\r\nto gigantic growth, and caused to vary in many of its parts, and the\r\nabundant food may even directly affect the germ-plasm so that all or\r\nsome of these variations may become hereditary; and yet this is far\r\nfrom being a case of adaptation, it is merely a case of simultaneous\r\nvariations, and it is questionable whether they will make the continued\r\nexistence of the plant under the new conditions possible or not. It\r\nmight easily happen, for instance, that the plant, though it became\r\nlarger and bore more abundant blossoms, would be sterile, and therefore\r\nunfitted for continued existence in a natural state. Variations are not\r\nnecessarily adaptations; the latter can never come about solely through\r\ndirect influence upon the germ-plasm. What direct influence upon the\r\ngerm-plasm could, for instance, make the hind-legs of a mammal long and\r\nstrong and the fore-legs short and weak? Obviously neither an increase\r\nnor decrease in the food-supply, nor a higher or lower temperature--in\r\nshort, no direct influence, because all these affect the germ-plasm as\r\na whole, and therefore cannot possibly influence two homologous groups\r\nof determinants in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nThis, it seems to me, is only possible when amphimixis brings about\r\nin one individual a favourable coincidence of the chance germinal\r\nvariations of the determinants of the fore- and hind-limbs; and just\r\nas it is with the two variations in this simple hypothetical case,\r\nso it will be in the actual processes of adaptation where there are\r\ninvolved numerous--we know not how numerous--variations essential to a\r\n'harmonious adaptation.'\r\n\r\nIt need not be objected that the very number of variations necessary to\r\na 'harmonious adaptation' makes its occurrence impracticable; for it\r\nis _the complete_ harmony of the parts that makes the adaptation, and\r\nwithout this the individual was only imperfectly adapted, and therefore\r\nincapable of survival. It is certainly not mathematically demonstrable\r\nthat this is the case, but as the whole process of transformation which\r\nmakes an old adaptation into a new one begins with minimal fluctuations\r\nof the determinants, which must first be brought by germinal selection\r\nto the level of selection-value, and must then be subject to personal\r\nselection, so the whole process goes on so gradually and by such\r\nsmall steps that the harmony of the parts is maintained by functional\r\nadaptation during the individual life in a great number of individuals.\r\nBut these are just the individuals which survive in the struggle for\r\nexistence, and at the same time possess at every stage of the process\r\n_the best combination of favourably varying determinants_. As these\r\nfavourable variations are, in consequence of germinal selection, not\r\nmere isolated variations of fluctuating importance, but variations in\r\na _definite direction_, the whole process of variation must persist\r\nin every single part in the direction imposed upon it by personal\r\nselection. But since at every reducing division the ids of the\r\ngerm-cells are brought down to half their number, a possibility is\r\noffered for gradually removing the unfavourable ids from the germ-plasm\r\nof the species, since the descendants resulting from the most\r\nunfavourable id-combinations always perish, and so from generation to\r\ngeneration the germ-plasm gets rid of its unfavourably varying ids, and\r\nthe most propitious combinations afforded by amphimixis are preserved,\r\ntill ultimately there remain only those combinations which are varying\r\nappropriately, or at least only those in which the appropriately\r\nvarying determinants are in the majority, and so have controlling\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nLogically this deduction is undoubtedly indisputable, from the\r\nstandpoint of the germ-plasm theory; but whether it may be regarded as\r\na sufficient reason for the introduction of amphimixis, and for its\r\nextremely tenacious persistence throughout the course of the long and\r\nintricate phylogeny, cannot be maintained without special investigation.\r\n\r\nAgainst my position the objection has often been urged that an\r\narrangement cannot arise or be maintained through natural selection\r\nunless it is _of direct use_ to the individual in which it occurs.\r\nSexual reproduction cannot therefore have been established simply\r\nbecause it advances, or even because it makes possible the adaptations\r\nof species, for these adaptations only came about occasionally, perhaps\r\nonce in a thousand generations or even less frequently; thus the\r\nintervening generations could derive no advantage of any kind from the\r\narrangement in question, and therefore, according to the law of the\r\ndegeneration of unused characters, it must have long since been lost. I\r\nmentioned this objection before, but was obliged to postpone a detailed\r\nconsideration of it until we had discussed germinal selection.\r\n\r\nWe admit, of course, that characters are only preserved intact as\r\nlong as they are of advantage sufficient to turn the scale in favour\r\nof their possessors, and that they begin to fall from their height of\r\nperfection when that is no longer the case; we admit also that new\r\nadaptations are not continually necessary, but are so only at intervals\r\nof long series of generations, and yet the objection cited seems to me\r\nbaseless.\r\n\r\nLeaving out of account, for the moment, the first introduction of\r\namphimixis, let us deal with it as an existing occurrence, for the\r\ntenacious persistence of which we wish to find reasons.\r\n\r\nIs it really the case that amphimixis is only of importance in\r\nconnexion with the new adaptation of a species, and that it has nothing\r\nto do with the persistence of the species in the state of adaptation\r\nalready attained? According to the conception of the processes within\r\nthe germ-plasm which we have already stated, it is impossible that this\r\nshould be the case, for continual slight fluctuations are occurring in\r\nthe determinants in consequence of the fluctuations of the nutritive\r\nstream, and these slight variations, plus or minus, do not in many\r\ncases equalize one another or counteract one another by turning again\r\nin a contrary direction; they go on increasing in the direction in\r\nwhich they have begun. It is only when personal selection opposes them\r\nthat they come to a standstill, and this can only happen when they\r\nattain to selection-value, that is to say, when they reach a level at\r\nwhich they become disadvantageous in the struggle of persons. But as\r\ngerminal variations of this kind are continually occurring, personal\r\nselection must keep continual watch over them, and eradicate them as\r\nsoon as they have attained selection-value.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when a species is most perfectly adapted to its conditions,\r\nit would of necessity begin to degenerate if personal selection were\r\nnot continually guarding it, and setting aside everything that is in\r\nexcess or deficient as soon as it begins to be prejudicial. But the\r\nadaptation of a species does not depend upon _one_ character persisting\r\nat its normal level, but on the persistence of very many, and many of\r\nthese vary simultaneously upwards or downwards, and reach the limit of\r\nselection-value at one time or another. If there were no amphimixis,\r\nthen either all individuals with any excessive variant would be at\r\nonce eliminated, or the species would go on deteriorating until this\r\nexcessive variant was so numerously and strongly represented in all\r\nits individuals that it would perish through degeneration. But even\r\nin the first of these cases the species would drift towards the fate\r\nof extinction, because excessive variations do occur even in every\r\nasexual generation, and would appear in an increasingly large number\r\nof determinants if there were no possibility of rejecting them and\r\neliminating them from the lineage of the species.\r\n\r\nThis is made possible through the periodic intervention of amphimixis;\r\nit is actually effected thereby; and in this way alone the species\r\nis kept at its high-water mark of adaptation. It is not necessary\r\nto assume that every single determinant which is varying in an\r\nunfavourable direction is at once eliminated as soon as it becomes\r\nprejudicial, that is, reaches negative selection-value, or--to make\r\nuse of an expression introduced by Ammon--as soon as it oversteps the\r\nboundaries of the 'playground of variations,' the limits within which\r\nvariations are neither favourable nor unfavourable. But _in the course\r\nof generations_ they are unfailingly eliminated, especially when a\r\nlarge number of unfavourably varying determinants are coincident in\r\nthe germ-plasm. Then the individuals which arise from a germ-plasm\r\nthus composed must perish in the struggle for existence, and thus the\r\nid-combinations with excessive determinants are eliminated from the\r\ngerminal constitution of the species. As this is repeated as often as\r\nexcesses of the ids occur, the species is kept pure.\r\n\r\nIt might be objected that, through such a continual weeding-out of\r\nrebellious determinants, the germ-plasm would become so constant in\r\nits constitution that it would ultimately be secure from all such\r\naberrations of it on the part of its determinants, and therefore would\r\nin time become quite incapable of diverging from its proper path at\r\nall, and would thus no longer require this continual correction through\r\namphimixis.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to contradict this conclusion; indeed, I believe that the\r\nconstitution of the species becomes more and more constant in the way\r\nI have indicated, and that an ever more perfect and stable equilibrium\r\nof the whole determinant system is thus brought about. It follows that\r\nin the course of generations the diverse determinants of the germ-plasm\r\nwill vary within a progressively shortened radius, and will thus more\r\nand more rarely overstep the limits of the 'variation-playground'--and\r\nyet I still believe that this justifiable conclusion tells in favour of\r\nmy interpretation of the utility of the persistence of amphigony once\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nLet it be remarked, in the first place, that it is by no means\r\nessential to the preservation of a useful institution that it should\r\npractically justify its utility in _every_ generation. Although, for\r\ninstance, the warm winter coat of a species of mammal may be necessary\r\nto its survival, it does not disappear at once when a winter happens\r\nto occur which is so warm that even individuals with poor pellage can\r\nsurvive. Indeed, several such mild winters might occur in succession,\r\nin which there was no weeding-out of the individuals with poor fur, and\r\nyet the thickness of the winter fur of the species would not become\r\nless fixed, just because this character no longer varies perceptibly\r\nin an old-established species which has long been perfectly adapted,\r\nand it could only be brought into a state of marked fluctuation very\r\nslowly through direct influence on the germ-plasm, or through panmixia.\r\nBut exactly the same thing is true in regard to the determinants of the\r\nreproductive cells, in respect of their adaptation to amphimixis, only\r\nvery much more emphatically.\r\n\r\nBefore going further, I should like to show that the conclusion\r\nwe have just deduced from the theory, namely, that the equilibrium\r\nof the determinant system of a species increases in stability with\r\nthe duration of its persistence, holds good not only for the whole\r\nsystem, but for its individual parts, that is, for the individual\r\ncharacters and adaptations. Experience teaches that characters are the\r\nmore exactly and constantly transmitted the older they are; generic\r\ncharacters are more constant than species-characters, order-characters\r\nmore persistent than family-characters--this is implied even in their\r\nname. But we are able to show even in relation to the characters of\r\na species that those which have been fixed for a long time are most\r\nprecisely and purely transmitted; that is, that their determinants are\r\nleast inclined to overstep the limits of the 'variation-playground'\r\neither in an upward or downward direction.\r\n\r\nTwo groups of facts prove this: first the observed fact that the very\r\ndifferent degree of variability which the different species exhibit is\r\nby no means common to all the characters of the species in the same\r\nmeasure; for individual characters may be variable or constant in very\r\ndifferent degrees.\r\n\r\nMany years ago[21] I drew attention to the fact that the different\r\nstages in the life-history of insects, especially of Lepidoptera,\r\nmight be variable in quite different degrees. Thus, for instance,\r\nthe caterpillar might be very variable, and yet the butterfly which\r\narises from it might be extremely constant. I concluded from this--what\r\nprobably no one now will dispute--that the various stages may vary\r\nphyletically independently of one another, that, for instance, the\r\ncaterpillar may adapt itself to a new manner of life, a new food-plant,\r\na new means of defence, while the butterfly, unaffected by this, goes\r\non quietly as it was before. Every new adaptation necessarily implies\r\nvariability, and so the stage which is in process of transformation\r\nmust have its period of variability, which gradually returns again to\r\ngreater constancy, and this the more completely the longer the series\r\nof generations through which the weeding out of the less well-adapted\r\nhas endured.\r\n\r\n[21] _Studien zur Descendenztheorie_, Leipzig, 1876.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only the individual stages of development that may be\r\nunequally variable; the same is true of the characters of a species\r\nwhich occur simultaneously. The most striking example of this known to\r\nme is the leaf-butterfly, which I have already mentioned many times\r\nin the course of these lectures--the Indian _Kallima paralecta_.\r\nIn this species the brown and red upper surface is almost alike in\r\ncolour and marking in all individuals, but the under surface, the\r\ncolour and marking of which is so deceptively mimetic of a leaf, is\r\nvariable to such a degree that it is difficult, among a large number\r\nof specimens, to find even a few which are as like one another as are\r\nthe members of species in which the under side is constant. It need\r\nnot be urged that this is due to the complexity of the marking on the\r\nunder side. In many of our indigenous butterflies the under side is\r\njust as complex in coloration and marking, and nevertheless it is very\r\nconstant, being almost identical in all individuals, as for instance\r\nin _Vanessa cardui_. In _Kallima_ the great variability of the under\r\nsurface certainly depends not merely on the fact that the mimetic\r\ncharacter has been only recently acquired (phyletically speaking), but\r\nchiefly on the fact that the dead leaves to which they approximate are\r\nthemselves very diverse in appearance, for many are dry, others moist\r\nand covered with mould, and that the adaptations have therefore gone in\r\ndifferent directions, and as yet, at least, have neither combined to\r\nform a single constant type, nor diverged to form two or three distinct\r\ntypes. The various 'leaf-pictures' seem equally effective in concealing\r\nthe insects from their enemies, and thus there is still a continual\r\ncrossing and mingling of the different essays at leaf-picturing.\r\n\r\nA second group of facts, which indicates that old-established\r\ncharacters have less tendency to overstep the limits of the neutral\r\n'variation-playground,' is to be found in the experience of breeders,\r\nand especially that of gardeners who have brought wild plants under\r\ncultivation in order to procure varieties.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved that the wild plants often exhibit no hereditary\r\nvariations for a long series of generations, notwithstanding the\r\ngreatly altered conditions of life, but that then a moment comes in\r\nwhich isolated variations crop up, which may then be intensified by\r\nthe manipulations of the breeder to form sport-species with large\r\nconspicuously coloured flowers, or with some other distinctive\r\ncharacter. Darwin called this a shattering of the constitution of the\r\nplant; but the stable and slowly varying 'constitution' simply means\r\nthat in old-established and well-adapted species the determinants\r\npossess only a very restricted 'variation-playground,' and because of\r\ntheir firmly based harmonious correlation are not easily and never very\r\nquickly induced to overstep its limits in any marked degree.\r\n\r\nLet us now apply all this to the institution of amphimixis and\r\namphigony, and it is immediately obvious that these determinants of the\r\ngerm-plasm which control the characters relating to sexual reproduction\r\nmust be _more stable and less variable than all others which a species\r\npossesses, for they are infinitely older_. They are older than all\r\nspecies-characters, older than the characters of the genus, of the\r\nfamily, of the class, and indeed of the whole series or phylum to\r\nwhich a higher animal, a vertebrate, for instance, belongs. We cannot\r\nwonder, therefore, that amphigony has persisted through hundreds and\r\nthousands of generations, even if it had not been reinforced in the\r\ngerm-plasm during this period by selection. We should rather wonder\r\nthat an institution so primaeval, and so firmly engrained in the\r\ngerm-plasm, can ever be departed from, even when its abandonment is to\r\nthe advantage of the species, as has happened in parthenogenesis.\r\n\r\nI have entered upon this long discussion because I believe that we\r\nrequire to appreciate this power of persistence on the part of the\r\nsexual determinants before we can explain the general occurrence of\r\namphigony. The occurrence of pure parthenogenesis, unaccompanied by\r\nany degeneration of the species, can hardly be understood except on\r\nthe assumption that the constancy of the species, when it has once\r\nbeen attained, may be preserved without the continual intervention of\r\namphimixis. How long it can be preserved is another question, which it\r\nis difficult or impossible to answer, since species exhibiting _pure_\r\nparthenogenesis are rare, and since we cannot tell with certainty\r\nhow long it is since amphimixis ceased to occur in them. Generally\r\nspeaking, the answer in regard to the few species which have to be\r\ntaken into account in this connexion would be 'not long,' but whether\r\nthis 'not long' signifies hundreds of generations or thousands of\r\ngenerations we must leave undecided. So much only we can say, that\r\nin all species of animals in which the male sex has quite died out\r\nor has dwindled to a minimal remnant, there are as yet no traces of\r\ndegeneration to be found, and that even organs which have fallen into\r\ndisuse and become functionless because amphigony has disappeared, are\r\nnevertheless in several cases retained in perfect completeness. I shall\r\nreturn to this subject later on, but in the meantime I wish to work\r\nout our conception of the actual efficacy of amphigony or ordinary\r\nsexual reproduction, and thereby increase our understanding of its\r\nsignificance and power of persistence.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that amphigony not only renders possible the novel\r\n'harmonious adaptations' which are continually required, but that it\r\nalso leads, by a continual crossing of individuals, simultaneously with\r\nthe elimination of the less fit, to a gradually increasing constancy of\r\nthe species. This has been regarded by some writers as its sole effect;\r\nthus recently by Hatschek, whose view has already been refuted.\r\n\r\nHaycraft also finds the significance of amphigony simply in the\r\nequalizing or neutralizing of individual differences which it effects.\r\nQuetelet and Galton have attempted to show that intercrossing leads to\r\na mean which then remains constant. Haycraft supposes that a species\r\ncan only remain constant if its individuals are being continually\r\nintercrossed, and that otherwise they would diverge and take different\r\nforms, because the 'protoplasm' has within itself the tendency to\r\ncontinual variation. The transformation of species is effected by\r\nmeans of this variation tendency, and the persistency and constancy\r\nof species which are already adapted to the conditions of their life\r\nare secured by the constant intercrossing of the individuals, and the\r\nconsequent neutralization of individual peculiarities.\r\n\r\nAlthough the cases already mentioned in which great constancy of\r\nspecies is associated with purely parthenogenetic reproduction do\r\nnot tell in favour of the accuracy of the view just stated, yet\r\nthe fundamental idea, that amphigony is an essential factor in the\r\nmaintenance and even in the evolution of species, is undoubtedly sound.\r\nWe should certainly find neither genera nor species in Nature if\r\namphigony did not exist; but we cannot simply suppose that amphigony\r\nand variation are, so to speak, antipodal forces, the former of which\r\nsecures the constancy of the species, the latter its transformation.\r\nIn my opinion, at all events, there is no such thing as a 'tendency'\r\nof the protoplasm to vary, although there is a constant fluctuation of\r\nthe characters--dependent on the imperfect equality of the external\r\ninfluences, especially of nutrition. This certainly results, as far\r\nas it takes place within the germ-plasm, in a continual upward and\r\ndownward variation of the hereditary tendencies, and it would lead to\r\nincreasing dissimilarity of the individuals were it not that amphigony\r\nis continually equalizing the differences by a constantly repeated\r\nmingling of individuals. Quetelet and Galton have shown that the\r\ntendency of this mingling is towards the establishment of a mean; the\r\ncharacters of Man, such as bodily size, fluctuate about a mean, which\r\nat the same time shows the maximum of frequency; and the frequency\r\ncurve of the various bodily sizes assumes a perfectly symmetrical\r\nform, so that the average size is the most frequent, and deviations\r\nfrom it upwards or downwards occur more rarely in proportion to the\r\namount of deviation, the largest and the smallest sizes occurring least\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\nThus an equalizing of variations by means of amphimixis really exists,\r\nand the question we have to ask is, How does it come about? The case\r\nis assuredly not the same as that in which equal quantities of red\r\nand white wine are mixed to make a so-called 'Schiller.' This is\r\nproved even by the fact that the mixture may turn out quite different\r\neven when the wines--the two parents--are alike: for the children\r\nof a pair are often dissimilar. And while the 'Schiller' cannot be\r\nseparated again into red wine and white, this happens often in sexual\r\nreproduction, and sometimes to such an extent that the grandchild\r\nexactly resembles one or other of the grand-parents, as is most clearly\r\nproved in the case of plant-hybrids.\r\n\r\nThere is thus a deep-seated difference, depending on the fact that\r\nwhat is mingled in amphigony is not simple but composite, not a\r\nsimple uniform developmental tendency associated with a simple and\r\ndefinite substance, but a combination of several or many developmental\r\ntendencies, associated with several equivalent but different material\r\nunits. These units are the ids or ancestral plasms, and we have seen\r\nhow they are not only halved by reducing division, but are also\r\narranged in new combinations in amphimixis.\r\n\r\nThese ids differ very little within the same germ-plasm; in species\r\nwhich have long been established the majority probably only differ\r\nin correspondence to the individual differences of the fully-formed\r\norganisms, but they are only absolutely alike in the case of two\r\nids which have been formed by the division of a mother-id. Let us\r\ndisregard this for the moment, and assume that all the ids of a\r\ngerm-plasm are different: the germ-plasm of a father, _A_, will be\r\ncomposed of ids _A_ 1-100, that of the mother, _B_, of the ids _B_\r\n1-100. But in each mature germ-cell of these two parents only fifty\r\nids are contained, and if we assume that the mingling of the ids is\r\ncontrolled solely by chance, then in the various germ-cells _A_ × _B_\r\nthe most diverse combinations of ids may be contained; for instance,\r\n_A_ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...to 99, or _A_ 1-10 and 20-30, and 40-50,\r\nand so on, and similarly in the germ-cells _B_. If all germ-cells\r\nproduced by _A_ and by _B_ attained to development, or even if all the\r\nova succeeded, the thousand or hundred thousand children of this pair\r\nwould necessarily exhibit every possible mingling of their characters,\r\nand each in the same number according to the rules of probability\r\ncalculations. But it is well known _that this does not happen_; of\r\nthe thousands of human ova, for instance, which come to maturity in\r\nthe course of the life of a female individual more than ten rarely\r\ndevelop, and more than thirty never, and these are determined solely\r\nby chance and quite independently of the mixture of ids which they\r\ncontain. It is thus purely a matter of chance which of the complexes\r\nof primary constituents contained in the germ-plasm of an individual\r\nare transmitted to descendants, and it is also purely a matter of\r\nchance which combination of ids comes to be developed. Therefore we may\r\nsay that no regular neutralizing of contrasts, either in the primary\r\nconstituents of the parents or as regards the differences in their\r\ncharacters, can occur. In one case there is a blended inheritance;\r\nin another the child takes after the father or after the mother; in a\r\nthird, and this probably occurs most frequently, the child resembles\r\nthe father in some characters and the mother in others.\r\n\r\nBut how then does Galton's curve of frequency of variations come about?\r\nWhy does the mean of any character occur by far the most frequently,\r\nand why does the frequency of a variation diminish regularly in\r\nproportion to its approximation to either extreme? To this it is\r\nanswered: Because the process of mingling through amphigony goes on\r\nthrough numerous generations, and thus an elimination of chance, and\r\nthe establishment of an average, must be brought about.\r\n\r\nBut this does not quite suffice to explain matters, for experience\r\nshows that asymmetrical frequency-curves of variations also occur, even\r\nin species with sexual reproduction. As De Vries has recently shown,\r\nthere are also 'half-Galton curves,' that is, curves which suddenly\r\nbreak off at their highest point. We must conclude from this that the\r\nfrequency of the different variations depends not only on their degree,\r\nbut also on the greater or less facility with which they arise from the\r\nconstitution of the species.\r\n\r\nThis consideration can be readily elucidated with the help of\r\nAmmon's exposition, and especially of his graphic representation\r\nof the 'playground of variations.' If we think of the indifferent\r\nvariations occurring in any character of a species as arranged in\r\na series ascending from the smallest to the largest, this line may\r\nbe regarded as the abscissal-axis, and from it ordinates may be\r\ndrawn which express the frequency of the variation in question by\r\nthe differences in their length. If the tips of these ordinates\r\nbe united, we have the curve of frequency (Fig. 120, _A_), which\r\naccording to Galton ought to be symmetrical, and in most cases really\r\nis so. Ammon calls the space between the smallest and the largest\r\nvariations the 'variation-playground,' that is, the playground within\r\nwhich all variations are equally advantageous to the species. This\r\nis not co-extensive with the variation-area, for there may be more\r\nmarked deviations below the beginning or above the upper end of the\r\nvariation-playground, but these, being disadvantageous, fall under\r\nthe shears of personal selection. The variation-playground may also\r\nbe called the area of indulgence of variation, because the variations\r\nfalling within it are spared from the eliminating activity of\r\nselection, or the variation-area of survivors, because on an average\r\nonly those survive whose variations do not overstep the limits of this\r\narea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120. _A_, symmetrical, and _B_, asymmetrical\r\ncurve of frequency; after Ammon. _U_, minimal, _O_, maximal limit of\r\nindividual variation. _U-O_, the 'variation-playground.' _M_, the mean\r\nof variation. _H_, the greatest frequency or mode of variation.]\r\n\r\nThis implies that variations below _U_ (the lower limit of the area\r\nof exemption) and above _O_ (the upper limit) can occur, but do not\r\nsurvive and leave descendants, and we can therefore easily understand\r\nwhy characters, of which different degrees arise with equal ease from\r\nthe constitution of the species, must gradually develop a symmetrical\r\ncurve of frequency because of the constant crossing. Obviously\r\nthose individuals which stand just upon the borders of admissible\r\nvariation will, other conditions being equal, leave behind them\r\nfewer descendants than those which approximate to the middle of the\r\narea of exemption; for as the characters concerned can vary in the\r\noffspring in both directions, there will always be at the lower end\r\nsome of the descendants of a pair which will fall below the limits of\r\nexemption, and at the upper end some which will rise above it. This\r\nwill happen even when pairing takes place between parents at the middle\r\nor at the other end of the abscissa, for there are always cases of\r\nthe preponderance of one parent in heredity. A higher percentage of\r\nthe descendants of individuals on the borderline will therefore be\r\neliminated, and their frequency _must therefore be less_. Even if at\r\nthe beginning of the series of observations a condition obtained in\r\nwhich all the ordinates of the area of exemption were equally high,\r\nthose nearest the boundaries would of necessity very soon become lower,\r\nand this in proportion to their distance from the boundary, and the\r\nfrequency-curve, which at first would be a straight line (according\r\nto our assumption, which of course does not tally with natural\r\nconditions), would become a symmetrical curve, highest in the middle\r\nand falling equally at either side.\r\n\r\nAmmon has worked out the hypotheses on which the curve of frequency\r\nwould become asymmetrical. Firstly, when the fertility is greater\r\ntowards the upper or lower limit of the area of exemption; secondly,\r\nwhen germinal selection forces the variation in a particular direction,\r\nupwards or downwards; and thirdly, 'when natural selection intervenes\r\ndiversely at the upper or lower limit.' Of these three possibilities\r\nthe first two must be acknowledged as quite probable, but the third,\r\nit seems to me, could only cause a temporary asymmetry of the curve,\r\nlasting, that is, only until a state of equilibrium has again been\r\nreached; but that may in certain conditions take a long time.\r\n\r\nAsymmetrical curves of frequency (Fig. 120, _B_) therefore arise, for\r\ninstance, when the intra-germinal conditions (the 'constitution of the\r\nspecies') more easily and therefore more frequently produce extreme\r\nvariations. In this case the area of exemption can only extend on one\r\nside, and must remain in this state. In _Caltha palustris_, the marsh\r\nmarigold, we may find, according to De Vries, among a hundred flowers,\r\nthose with five, six, seven, and eight petals, in the following\r\nproportions:--\r\n\r\n  Petals                   5   6  7  8\r\n  Number of flowers       72  21  6  1\r\n\r\nand thus there is an asymmetrical curve of frequency. But if we take\r\nthe whole area of variation as the area of exemption, that is, if we\r\nassume that it is indifferent for the species whether the flowers\r\nhave five, six, seven, or eight petals, the preponderance of the\r\nfive-petalled flowers may have its reason in the fact that it is much\r\neasier for five than six or more petals to be produced because of the\r\ninternal structure of the whole plant.\r\n\r\nIn this case the maximum of frequency lies at the lower limit of\r\nvariation, but it may also lie at the upper. Thus, according to De\r\nVries, the blossoms of _Weigelia_ vary, in regard to the number of\r\ntheir petal-tips, in the following manner. Six-tipped corollas were not\r\nfound, and among 1,145 flowers there were the following proportions:--\r\n\r\n  Tips of the corolla      3     4     5\r\n  Number of flowers       61   196   888\r\n\r\nIt is thus clear that amphimixis is an essential factor in the fixing\r\nof forms, but that it certainly does not of itself determine these, and\r\nthat it is not always the average of the variations that is the most\r\nfrequent, but that the form of the curve of frequency is determined by\r\nother factors also, namely, by germinal and personal selection and by\r\nthe directive control which these exert on variations.\r\n\r\nThe equalizing effect of amphigony may perhaps be expressed\r\nthus: In the case of every new adaptation there is at first a\r\nlarge area of variation, but this gradually decreases owing to\r\na continual restriction on the part of natural selection, until\r\nultimately--when the highest degree of constancy of the character or\r\nspecies has been attained--it only extends very little beyond the\r\n'adaptation-playground' or the 'area of exemption.'\r\n\r\nOne of the effects of amphimixis is thus to bring about an increasing\r\nrestriction of the area of variation, or, as we usually say, a\r\nconstancy of the facies of a given form, a condensation into a species.\r\nHow far this result is necessary or useful, and therefore how far\r\nit may be regarded as accounting for the persistence of amphimixis,\r\nwe shall discuss in the chapter on the formation of species. My own\r\nview is that even the fact that new adaptations are rendered possible\r\nthrough amphimixis and amphigony, the mode of reproduction associated\r\nwith it, affords in itself a sufficient reason why amphimixis should\r\nhave been retained when once it had been introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE OF AMPHIMIXIS (_continued_)\r\n\r\n Association of amphimixis with reproduction--Origin of amphimixis--Its\r\n lowest forms--Amphimixis in Coccidia--Chromosomes in unicellular\r\n organisms--_Coccidium proprium_--'Amœba-nests' as a preliminary\r\n stage to amphimixis--Plastogamy of the Myxomycetes--Result: a\r\n strengthening of the power of adaptation--Strengthening of the power\r\n of assimilation--Use of complete amphimixis--Proof of its constant\r\n efficacy to be found in the rudimentary organs of Man--Allogamy--Means\r\n taken to prevent the mingling of nearly related forms--Amphimixis is\r\n not a 'formative' stimulus--Attraction of the germ-cells--Effects of\r\n inbreeding compared with those of parthenogenesis--Nathusius's case of\r\n injurious inbreeding--Hindrances to fertilization in the crossing of\r\n species--Probable reason for the injurious effect of inbreeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have endeavoured to understand why amphimixis should have been\r\nestablished among the processes of life, and we have now to turn to the\r\nquestion when and how, that is, in what form, it was first introduced.\r\nBut first I should like to refer for a little to the association of\r\namphimixis with reproduction, which we find in all multicellular\r\norganisms, and among the higher types so unexceptionally that, until\r\nnot very long ago, amphimixis and reproduction were looked on as\r\none and the same thing, and all multiplication was believed to be\r\nassociated with 'fertilization.' We have seen that this is not the\r\ncase, that on the other hand the two processes are quite distinct,\r\nand may be called contrasts rather than equivalents, for reproduction\r\nalways means an increase in the number of individuals, while amphimixis\r\nimplies--originally at least--their diminution by a half.\r\n\r\nAccordingly we found that, in unicellular organisms, amphimixis\r\nis not associated with reproduction, but interpolated between the\r\ndivisions, and not even in such a manner that amphimixis precedes every\r\nmultiplication by division, but so that the conjugation of two animals\r\noccurs only from time to time, after numerous divisions, sometimes\r\nhundreds, have occurred. It is obvious that this must be so, since, if\r\namphimixis occurred regularly between every two divisions, no increase\r\nin the number of individuals would be brought about, at least if the\r\nfusion of the two conjugating individuals were complete.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, is there such an intimate, and in the case of the higher\r\ntypes, such an indissoluble, association between reproduction and\r\namphimixis that 'fertilization' appears to be a _sine qua non_ of\r\nreproduction, and not very long ago seemed to us to be the 'quickening\r\nof the ovum,' the 'burning spark' which causes the powder-barrel to\r\nexplode?\r\n\r\nThe reason of this is not difficult to discover; it lies in the\r\nstructure of multicellular animals, and in their differentiation\r\naccording to the principle of division of labour, for since only\r\nparticular cells are capable of reproduction, that is, of giving\r\nrise to the whole, it is in these necessarily that the process of\r\namphimixis has to occur if its significance lies in its effects on the\r\nsucceeding generations. It is true that in the lowest multicellular\r\norganisms, such as the species of _Volvox_, there are, in addition\r\nto the sex-cells, other reproductive cells quite similar to the ova,\r\nwhose development into a new colony takes place without amphimixis,\r\nbut the higher we ascend in the animal and plant series the rarer are\r\nthese 'asexual' germ-cells or 'spores,' and in the highest animal types\r\nthey are entirely absent and reproduction occurs only by means of the\r\n'sex-cells.'\r\n\r\nI am inclined to look for the cause of this striking phenomenon mainly\r\nin the fact that, if amphimixis had to be retained, this was effected\r\nwith increasingly great difficulty the more highly and complexly\r\ndifferentiated the organisms became, and that more complicated\r\nadaptations were therefore necessary in order that the union of the\r\ntwo germ-cells might be rendered possible at all. There is first of\r\nall the separation into two kinds of sex-cells, whose far-reaching\r\ndifferentiations and precise adaptations to the most minute conditions\r\nwe have already discussed; then follow the innumerable adaptations\r\nto bring about the meeting of the sex-cells, the arrangements for\r\ncopulation, and, finally, the instincts which draw the two sexes\r\ntogether, the means of attraction which are employed, whether\r\ndecorative colours or attractive shapes, stimulating odours or musical\r\nnotes, in short, all the diverse and intricate arrangements, which\r\nseem to be more subtly elaborated the higher the organism stands upon\r\nthe ladder of life. When we call to mind that sexual differentiations\r\nfinally go so far that they dominate the whole organism, alike in\r\nits external appearance and in its internal nature, its feelings,\r\ninclinations, instincts, its will and ability, as well as its structure\r\ndown to the finest nerve-elements, we can understand that a mode of\r\nreproduction which demands such a composite disposition of details,\r\ninvolving a moulding of the whole organism, so to speak, from birth\r\ntill death, must of necessity remain the only one, and that there\r\nwas no room for the persistence of any essentially different mode\r\nof reproduction with quite different adaptations. Or, to speak\r\nmetaphorically, the power of adaptation which is innate in the organism\r\nso exhausted itself in the establishment of this marvellous amphimixis\r\nadjustment that the possibility of any other was totally excluded.\r\n\r\nIt is true that it is only among the Vertebrates that we find\r\n'the reproductive apparatus' so highly developed, but even among\r\nMolluscs and Arthropods 'sexual' reproduction, that is, reproduction\r\nassociated with amphimixis, is the prevailing mode. In these, indeed,\r\nparthenogenesis does occasionally occur, that is to say, sexually\r\ndifferentiated female germ-cells are, by means of some slight\r\nvariations in the maturation of the egg, rendered capable of developing\r\nwithout previous amphimixis, but this happens only in quite special\r\ncases as an adaptation to quite special circumstances, and can only\r\nbe regarded as a temporary cessation of the association between\r\nreproduction and amphimixis. In some cases it is a moiety of the ova\r\nadapted for amphimixis which develop parthenogenetically, as it is the\r\nsame sexually differentiated animals, true females, which produce both\r\nsorts, and this is often true to some extent when the differentiation\r\nin the direction of parthenogenesis has advanced further, and the\r\nova have been separated into those requiring fertilization and those\r\nwhich are parthenogenetic (e.g. the winter and the summer eggs of the\r\nDaphnidæ). Parthenogenesis is not asexual but unisexual reproduction,\r\na mode of multiplication which shows us that even in highly\r\ndifferentiated animals the apparently indissoluble association between\r\nreproduction and amphimixis can be dissolved if circumstances require\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut if amphimixis had to be retained in the higher animal forms--and we\r\nhave seen reasons why this must be--it could only be effected by means\r\nof unicellular germs, for amphimixis is in essence a fusion of nuclei,\r\nand this is the reason why 'vegetative' reproduction, so-called,\r\nbecomes less and less prominent in animals at least, and above the\r\nlevel of the Arthropods disappears almost entirely.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the question we asked at the beginning--When\r\nand in what form was amphimixis first introduced into the world of\r\norganisms? The best way to answer this is by observation. We must turn\r\nto the lowest forms which now exhibit it, and see whether it occurs\r\nin them in a simpler form, so that we may draw conclusions as to its\r\norigin and its primitive significance, for it would be possible, _a\r\npriori_, that this was something different from what it is now in\r\nthe relatively higher organisms, and that a change of function has\r\ngradually come about.\r\n\r\nAssuredly the whole intricate complex of adaptations which is now\r\nexhibited on the conjugation of the two sex-cells in animals and\r\nplants, the differentiation of two kinds of 'sexually' antagonistic\r\ncells, with all their special adaptations, the reduction of the\r\nchromosomes, the institution of the karyo-kinetic apparatus, together\r\nwith the centrospheres and so on, cannot possibly have arisen all at\r\nonce by fortuitous variation, but can only have arisen gradually,\r\nstep by step, and as the result of 'innumerable external and internal\r\ninfluences.' But why should not these arrangements, nowadays so\r\ncomplex, have had a simple beginning? Why might not this beginning have\r\nbeen the simple union of the protoplasmic bodies of two non-nucleated\r\nMonera; followed, after the origin of nuclear substances, by the union\r\nof these, and, finally, after the differentiation of a nucleus with\r\na definite number of chromosomes, with a dividing apparatus, with a\r\nmembrane, and so on, by complete amphimixis as we now know it? And how\r\nmany transition stages may not be added to fill up the gaps between\r\nthese three main stages?\r\n\r\nBut how much we can actually prove in regard to these conceivable\r\npreliminary stages of amphimixis is another matter. If we take a survey\r\nof the observations that have been made up till now, we are confronted\r\nat first by the undoubtedly striking fact that very little is known\r\nabout it as yet, for in fact the whole process is gone through even\r\nin quite lowly forms of life in a manner very similar to that in the\r\nhigher forms. Amphimixis has been shown to be widespread even among\r\nunicellular organisms, yet not in an _essentially_ simpler mode than\r\namong multicellulars. We have seen that even in ciliated Infusorians\r\nreducing division obtains, and that of the four nuclei which arise\r\nfrom twofold division of the original nucleus three break up again,\r\nand only the fourth, by a further division, separates into a male and\r\na female pronucleus, 'which then complete the amphimixis with the\r\ncorresponding pro-nuclei of another animal' (compare Fig. 85, 4-7, vol.\r\ni. p. 321). This, and the existence of a dividing apparatus and of\r\nchromosomes, make the process appear very little less complicated than\r\nthe fertilization of higher animals. The case is similar even in much\r\nlower unicellular organisms, such as _Noctiluca_ (Fig. 83, vol. i. p.\r\n317). In this form and in Rhizopods it is true that reducing divisions\r\nhave not yet been made out, but their occurrence in the lower Algæ\r\n(_Basidiobolus_), and above all in those simple unicellular organisms\r\nwhich give rise to malaria, and their allies, which live as 'Coccidia'\r\nin the blood-cells and intestinal cells of animals, leads us to expect\r\nthat they may prove to be of general occurrence among unicellulars.\r\n\r\nIn the Coccidia, which are extremely simple unicellular organisms,\r\nequipped, however, with a nucleus, the adaptations relating to\r\namphimixis are more extensive and more complex than in the Rhizopods.\r\nFor while in the latter the two conjugating cells are absolutely alike\r\nin external appearance, in the former the male cell is distinct from\r\nthe female, and indeed the differences are as marked as those that\r\nusually occur in multicellular animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121. Life-cycle of _Coccidium lithobii_, a\r\ncell-parasite of the centipede _Lithobius_; after Schaudinn. 1, a\r\n'sporozoite'; 2, the same penetrating into an intestinal epithelial\r\ncell; 3, the same growing into a 'schizont' capable of division; 4, the\r\nsame dividing, and 5, breaking up into numerous pieces which separate\r\nfrom the 'residual body' in the centre, and either, as in 1, migrate\r\ninto epithelial cells and repeat the history, or pass on to the phase\r\nof sexual reproduction. In the latter case, after eliminating a portion\r\nof the nucleus (reduction) in 6 and 6 _a_, they form the 'macrogamete'\r\n(the ovum); or within the mother-cell they produce microgametes (or\r\nsperm-cells), 7 and 7 _a_. The penetration of a sperm-cell into an\r\negg-cell (amphimixis) is shown in 8, the fertilized egg-cell (9)\r\nbecomes the so-called oocyst or permanent spore, from which by repeated\r\ndivision (10 and 11), new sporozoites, as in 1, arise, and begin the\r\ncycle afresh.]\r\n\r\nWe owe our present knowledge of these processes especially to Schuberg,\r\nSchaudinn, and Siedlecki, and, because of their theoretical importance,\r\nI should like to summarize the essential points.\r\n\r\nOne of these Coccidia lives in the intestinal cells of a small\r\ncentipede, _Lithobius_; in Fig. 121 the parasite is shown as a\r\nso-called 'Sporozoite,' that is, as a minute sickle-shaped cell,\r\nwhich at first moves freely about the intestine of the host (1), but\r\nthen soon penetrates into an epithelial cell (2). There it grows to\r\na spherical shape (3), and then, after having devoured the cell,\r\nit gives rise, by a peculiar process of division (Schizogony), to\r\na number of very minute nucleated pieces, again sickle-shaped, the\r\nSchizonts, each of which bores its way into an epithelial cell as in\r\n2, and follows the same path of development, so that a large number of\r\ncells in the intestine of the same host are attacked in this manner.\r\nBut there is still another mode of reproduction, with which amphimixis\r\nis associated, which leads directly to the formation of 'lasting'\r\ngerms which are enclosed in a capsule or cyst, reach the exterior with\r\nthe excrement of the host, and thus spread the infection to other\r\ncentipedes. The Schizonts which take this course develop into so-called\r\nmacro-gametes and microgametes, the former being the female, the latter\r\nthe male germ-cells. Then follows the penetration of a male gamete,\r\nactively motile because of its two flagella, into the female gamete\r\n(8). Amphimixis is accomplished, and the product of the fusion of the\r\ntwo sex-cells (9) surrounds itself with a thinner cyst, within which\r\nit multiplies by twofold division into four cells (10). These are the\r\n'lasting' spores, which may dry up within the voided excrement of the\r\ncentipede (11), and if they be eaten by another animal of the species,\r\nthey infect it, for the sporozoites which have been formed by the\r\nprevious divisions creep out, and in form 1 begin the life-history anew.\r\n\r\nWe have thus an alternation of four generations which are all\r\nunicellular, and of which one series (1-5) shows multiplication by\r\nfission, while the other (6-11) includes, besides multiplication\r\nby fission and as a condition of this, the process of amphimixis.\r\nAmphimixis _must_ occur in order that the formation of 'lasting' spores\r\nand new sporozoites may result. We have thus a regular alternation\r\nof 'asexual' and 'sexual' reproduction, and the latter shows great\r\nresemblance to that of multicellular organisms. The macrogamete\r\ncorresponds to the ovum, the microgametes to the spermatozoa, and they\r\nresemble these also in their greater numbers and in their structure.\r\n\r\nBut the resemblance goes even further. The ovum is much larger than the\r\nsperm-cell, and undergoes a kind of reduction of its nuclear substance;\r\nshortly before fertilization the ovum-nucleus ('the germinal vesicle')\r\ncomes to the surface--just as in the case of animal ova--bursts, and\r\nextrudes a part of its substance in the form of a sphere (Fig. 121, 6\r\nand 7). A reduction of the nuclear substance in the male cell has not\r\nbeen demonstrated in all cases, but in one of the _Lithobius_-Coccidia,\r\n_Adelea ovata_, the relatively large microgamete (the sperm-cell, Fig.\r\n122, _Mi_) places itself close to one pole of the female macrogamete\r\n(the egg-cell) and then divides twice in succession, so that four small\r\ncells arise (Fig. 122, _A-C_); of these only one penetrates into the\r\negg-cell (_D_, ♂_K_) and unites with it, the other three come to nought\r\n(_D_, _Mi_). What a surprising resemblance this bears to the twofold\r\ndivision of the mother sperm-cell in multicellular animals, through\r\nwhich the number of chromosomes is reduced to half! In the conjugation\r\nitself the thread-like chromosomes of the female nucleus are plainly\r\nrecognizable, while those of the male remain coiled up (Fig. 122, _D_).\r\n\r\nThat the nuclear substance can be separated into chromosomes (ids) even\r\nin lowly unicellular organisms was probably first demonstrated by R.\r\nHertwig for _Actinosphærium_, a Heliozoon or freshwater sun-animalcule,\r\nthen by Lauterborn in regard to Diatoms, by Blochmann for an indigenous\r\nRhizopod, _Euglypha_, and by Ishikawa for the marine _Noctiluca_. Fresh\r\ncases have been added in the last decade, so that we can now say that\r\na considerable number of unicellulars, from the ciliated Infusorians\r\nand lower Algæ down to the Coccidia and Diatoms, exhibit a germ-plasm\r\ncomposed of ids. These structures behave in the same way as those in\r\nhigher organisms, and Berger was able to demonstrate, in 1900, in the\r\ncase of a Radiolarian, their multiplication by spontaneous splitting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122. Conjugation of a Coccidium (_Adelea ovata_),\r\nafter Schaudinn and Siedlecki. _A_, the microgamete (sperm-cell)\r\n(_Mi_) has become closely apposed to the macrogamete (_Ma_). _B_, the\r\nreduction division of the nucleus of the macrogamete has been effected;\r\n_Rk_, directive corpuscles. In the microgamete the first division of\r\nthe nucleus has begun. _C_, four nuclei in the microgamete, of which\r\nthree come to nought. _D_, the fourth microgamete-nucleus (♂_K_)\r\nhas become apposed to the nucleus of the ovum, in which distinct\r\nchromosomes are seen.]\r\n\r\nFrom our point of view all this cannot surprise us, since all these\r\norganisms, though only single cells, possess great complexity of\r\nstructure; we need only call to mind the extremely fine differentiation\r\nof structure in numerous ciliated Infusorians, such as _Stentor_, which\r\nhas already been mentioned, or the bell-animalcule (_Vorticella_) with\r\nits long and peculiarly ciliated gullet, its retractile ciliated disk,\r\nits muscular or myophane layer, its spirally retractile stalk with the\r\nribbon-like, rapidly acting muscular axis; or the regular geometrically\r\nconstructed flinty skeleton of the Radiolarians, with their radially\r\ndisposed sword-like or rod-like needles and their complex interlacing\r\nlattice-work shells. In the latter case the complexity of the living\r\nsubstance becomes visible only through its product, the shell, for the\r\nprotoplasm itself does not show any visible intricacy, and the same is\r\ntrue of the Coccidium whose life-history we have just been tracing,\r\nfor in each of its stages it seems to be of very simple organization,\r\nthough the succession of numerous different forms shows that its\r\ngerm-substance must be composed of numerous determinants.\r\n\r\nWe cannot doubt, however, that, in all unicellular organisms, the\r\nprotoplasm can be hardly less complicated as regards its minute\r\ninvisible structure, since otherwise it would be impossible that the\r\ndelicate vital processes which we observe in them should run their\r\ncourse. In this I agree, at least in principle, with the beautiful\r\npicture drawn by Ludwig Zehnder in his recent book[22] already\r\nmentioned, though he reached it in quite a different way, namely,\r\nby a purely synthetic method. He made the daring attempt to build\r\nup the organic world from below, starting from atoms and molecules,\r\nand ascending from these to the lowest vital units, our biophors, to\r\nwhich he attributes a tubular shape and therefore calls fistellæ. He\r\nimagines the cell to be made up of a large number, perhaps millions,\r\nof different kinds of fistellæ, of which one presides over the power\r\nof turgidity, another over endosmosis, a third over contraction, a\r\nfourth over the conduction of stimuli, &c., so that there results a\r\nhigh degree of cellular complexity, a composition out of numerous\r\nkinds of biophors arranged on a definite architectural plan. All this\r\ncorresponds perfectly with the views I have so long championed, and\r\nwhich alone make the existence of a nucleus intelligible, if it is\r\ncomposed--as I assume--essentially of an accumulation of determinants,\r\nthat is, of hereditary substances. And that such a high degree\r\nof complexity of structure is not a mere fanciful picture we see\r\noccasionally even in the case of unicellular organisms. Thus, for\r\ninstance, in _Coccidium proprium_, parasitic in the newt (_Triton_),\r\nthe macrogamete or egg-cell (Fig. 123, _Ma_) before fertilization by\r\nthe sperm-cell or microgamete (Fig. 123, _Mi_) surrounds itself with a\r\ncapsule, at one pole of which a minute opening, the micropyle, remains\r\nfor the entrance of the male cell. This proves, it seems to me, that\r\nthis particular spot of the capsule is hereditarily determined, just\r\nas much and just as definitely as the ray of the flint-skeleton of a\r\nRadiolarian. But if any spot of the capsule can vary by itself alone,\r\nmay not numerous other points in the animal also be hereditarily\r\ndeterminable? With such complexity of the invisible structure it\r\nwould not greatly surprise us if we should find amphimixis occurring\r\nin all unicellular organisms, and in many of them at a high level of\r\nelaboration. These apparently lowly and simple organisms are obviously\r\nvery far from being the lowliest and simplest, as we shall discover\r\nlater in a different connexion. But that amphimixis is found as a\r\nperiodically recurring process even among these, must depend upon the\r\nfact that here too the preservation of the best-adapted structure, as\r\nwell as adaptability to new conditions, requires that the best variants\r\nof many different parts of the cell should be brought together,\r\nand since the hereditary substance lies in the ids of the nucleus,\r\nthe union of the ids of two unicellulars will make harmonious and\r\nmany-sided adaptation materially easier. It will thus give an advantage\r\nin the struggle for existence, and we may therefore expect to find that\r\nthe nuclear substance in all unicellular organism is made up of ids.\r\n\r\n[22] Zehnder, _Die Entstehung des Lebens_, Freiburg-i.-Br., 1899.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123. Conjugation of _Coccidium proprium_, a\r\ncellular parasite of the newt (_Triton_), after Siedlecki. _A_, a\r\nmicrogamete (_Mi_) in the act of penetrating the shell of a macrogamete\r\n(_Ma_) through the micropyle. _B_, the male and the female nuclear\r\nconstituents are uniting (♂ _chr_ and ♀ _chr_).]\r\n\r\nThe observations hitherto made do not, however, appear to bear this\r\nout, for in the lower Flagellata and Algæ the nuclear substance does\r\nindeed consist of chromatin, but--as far as it can be made out--of a\r\ncompact unarranged mass of it. But even though deeper investigations\r\nshould succeed in demonstrating chromosomes in many of these, the\r\nnucleus _must have arisen at some time_, and we must assume that it\r\ndid so through a more intimate union of previously loose aggregates of\r\ndeterminants, which were gradually arranged and bound together by the\r\ncombining forces (affinities) we have assumed to obtain among them,\r\nthus giving rise to the first chromosomes or ids which were complete in\r\nthemselves. Then came the multiplication of these ids by the process of\r\ndivision, and only then was the state arrived at from which amphimixis,\r\nas we now know it, could have arisen, namely, the existence of a\r\nconsiderable number of identical ids, half of which could be exchanged\r\nfor the identical ids of another individual in conjugation.\r\n\r\nBut as to our question, In what organisms did amphimixis first arise,\r\nand how? there seems, from what we have already learned with regard\r\nto the Coccidia, little prospect of our being able to give a definite\r\nanswer, for if amphimixis occurs even in these lowly organisms, and\r\noccurs, too, in the same manner as in the higher unicellular organisms,\r\nand not very much more simply than among the highest multicellular\r\norganisms, we may conclude that the preliminary stages will now be very\r\ndifficult or impossible to detect, either because they are extinct, or\r\nbecause they occur only in ultra-microscopic organisms.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there do appear to be preliminary stages, and they are\r\nexactly those which we should have assumed if we had been obliged to\r\nconstruct them theoretically.\r\n\r\nThe first phenomenon of this kind is the mere juxtaposition of two or\r\nmore unicellular organisms, without the occurrence of fusion. This was\r\nprobably first observed by Gruber in Amœbæ, and it was theoretically\r\ninterpreted at a later date by Rhumbler. As many as fifty Amœbæ gather\r\ntogether to form a 'nest,' and remain closely apposed to each other for\r\na fortnight. Although no fusion took place, and there were no visible\r\nresults of this juxtaposition, it may be concluded that the animals had\r\nsome sort of attractive effect upon each other, and it may be supposed\r\nthat some sort of advantage must have been associated with this state\r\nof quiet, close apposition against one another. Cytotropism, the\r\nmutual attraction of similar cells, which Wilhelm Roux first observed\r\nin the segmentation-cells of the frog's egg, seems to occur also in\r\nunicellular organisms, and this may help us to understand how a fusion\r\nof cell-bodies may have come about.\r\n\r\nFusion of this kind was demonstrated in the Myxomycetes almost forty\r\nyears ago by De Bary, and it has been observed more recently in various\r\nunicellular organisms, especially in Rhizopods and in Heliozoa.\r\nThese last often place themselves close together in pairs, threes,\r\nor even more at a time, and then the delicate cell-bodies coalesce,\r\nthough no fusion of the nuclei takes place. With Hartog, we call this\r\nprocess 'Plastogamy,' but we cannot agree with that observer when he\r\nregards the importance of the process as consisting in the fact that\r\nthe nuclei thus come into contact with fresh cell-substance, after\r\nhaving been surrounded for a very long time with the same cytoplasm.\r\nIf this were the import of amphimixis, then an _exchange of nuclei_\r\nwould take place, and this we find nowhere even among the lowest forms\r\nof life, for everywhere there is a union of the nuclear substance of\r\ntwo individuals. But this is by the way! Further cases of plastogamy\r\nhave been observed in many of the limy-shelled Rhizopods. A union of\r\nthis kind does not usually lead to any visible consequences, but in\r\nsome Foraminifera a group of young animals is developed within the\r\ncell-bodies by the division of the nuclei and the cell-body; thus\r\nmultiplication follows the fusion just as in perfect amphimixis, and\r\nwe may therefore assume that there is a causal connexion between the\r\ntwo. In the slime-fungi, too, the union of several amœba-like cells\r\ninto a multi-nucleated plasmodium is followed later by the development\r\nof numerous encapsuled spores, but only after the plasmodium, which to\r\nbegin with is microscopically small, has grown to a macroscopically\r\nvisible, reticulated mass (_Æthalium_) sometimes a foot in extent. In\r\nthis case the fungus, creeping slowly over its foundation of decaying\r\nsubstance, takes up nourishment from it, and it is not possible to\r\ntell whether the union of the amœbæ yields any further advantage than\r\nthat of facilitating the spreading over large uneven surfaces, and\r\nthrough this, later, the development of large fruit-bodies. But in the\r\ncase of the Foraminifera the plastogamy has obviously another effect,\r\nunknown and mysterious, which as yet no one has ever been able to\r\ndefine precisely. Words like 'stimulus to growth,' 'stimulating of\r\nthe metabolism,' and even 'rejuvenation,' give no insight into what\r\nhappens, but that something happens, that through the fusion of two or\r\nmore unicellulars a stimulus is exerted, which reveals itself later in\r\nincreased rapidity of growth, we may, and indeed must assume, because\r\nthis process has become a permanent arrangement in so many unicellular\r\norganisms. Only what is useful survives, and the uniting individuals\r\nmust derive some advantage from the process of fusion, and it remains\r\nto be seen whether we can find out with any clearness what this\r\nadvantage may be.\r\n\r\nTill within a few decades ago it was believed that in this process\r\none individual devoured the other, but this can now no longer be\r\nmaintained. If any one still seriously considers this possible,\r\nSchaudinn's observations would convince him of his error, for in\r\n_Trichosphærium_, a marine, many-nucleated Rhizopod, he observed, on\r\nthe one hand, the union of two or more animals, i. e. plastogamy, and\r\non the other hand, the swallowing and digesting of a smaller member\r\nof the species by a larger one--two processes which are absolutely\r\ndifferent, for in the first case the cell-bodies of the two animals\r\nremain intact, while an animal that is eaten becomes surrounded by a\r\nfood-vacuole, and is dissolved and digested within it. In the former\r\ncase the vital units (biophors) of each animal obviously remain intact\r\nand capable of function; in the second, those of the over-mastered\r\nanimal are at once dissolved and chemically broken up; as biophors,\r\ntherefore, they cease to exist. Whether one or the other process takes\r\nplace may perhaps depend on whether the two animals differ greatly in\r\nsize, so that the smaller can be quite surrounded by the larger.\r\n\r\nIn a former lecture I have emphatically expressed my dissent from the\r\nview which interprets amphimixis as a process of rejuvenation, meaning\r\nthereby a necessary renewal of life, and I need not go into this again\r\nin detail: for that the metabolism can continue through uncounted\r\ngenerations without being artificially stimulated--that is, in any\r\nother way than by nutrition--is proved by all those lowly organisms\r\nwhich exhibit neither plastogamy nor complete amphimixis, and also by\r\nthe occurrence of purely parthenogenetic reproduction, &c. In what,\r\nthen, can the advantage lie which the conjugating unicellular organisms\r\nderive from conjugation? Obviously not in that they impart to each\r\nother what each already possessed, but only in the communication of\r\nsomething special and individual, something that was peculiar to each,\r\nand becomes common to both.\r\n\r\nHaberlandt believed that the development of auxo-spores in Diatoms\r\npointed towards the processes which form the deepest roots of\r\namphimixis. As is well known, the hard and unyielding flinty shell\r\nof these lowly Algæ involves a diminution of the organism at every\r\ndivision, so that the Diatoms become smaller and smaller as they go\r\non multiplying, and if that went on without limit they would come\r\nrapidly to extinction. But a corrective is supplied in the periodical\r\noccurrence of conjugation of two organisms which have already\r\nmaterially diminished in size, and this is followed by the growth of\r\nthe two fused individuals to the original normal size of the species.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, obvious that in this case the union of two organisms\r\nwhich have become too small may be of advantage in bringing them back\r\nto the requisite normal size; but this is an isolated special case,\r\nwhich certainly does not justify our regarding conjugation as a means\r\nwhereby diminished bodily size may be brought back to its normal\r\nproportions. By far the greater number of unicellular organisms are not\r\npermanently diminished in size by division, and even in the Diatoms the\r\nmass of the two fused individuals does not amount to the normal size of\r\nthe species, so that even in this case there must be growth subsequent\r\nto the conjugation before the normal is re-attained. It may be doubted,\r\ntherefore, whether the increase in mass is, even in the case cited, the\r\nessential event in conjugation, and whether there are not other effects\r\nwhich we cannot clearly recognize. Here, too, there must be differences\r\nbetween the two conjugating individuals, as we have just seen, for if\r\nthey only communicated something similar to each other, the result\r\nwould be an increase only in their mass, not in their qualities.\r\n\r\nAlthough we cannot demonstrate differences of this kind in the case\r\nof the lowly organisms with which we are now dealing, we may assume\r\ntheir existence from analogy with the higher organisms. We know,\r\nespecially through G. Jäger, that in Man every individual has a\r\nspecific exhalation, his particular odour, and that in the secretions\r\nof his glands there are incalculably minute differences in chemical\r\ncomposition, which justify the conclusion that the living substance\r\nof the secreting cells themselves exhibits such differences, and that\r\nall the various kinds of cells in an individual are not absolutely\r\nidentical with the corresponding cells of another individual, but\r\nthat they are distinguished from them by minute yet constant chemical\r\ndifferences. The assumption that differences of this kind exist even\r\nin unicellulars, and in all lowly organisms generally, is not a merely\r\nfanciful one, but has much probability.\r\n\r\nHow far the combination of these individual differences of chemical,\r\nand at the same time vital, organization is able to quicken, to\r\nstrengthen the metabolism, to bring about 'physiological regeneration,'\r\nor whatever we may choose to call it, we do not yet understand. It has\r\nbeen said that in plastogamy an exchange of 'substances' takes place;\r\nthat each gives to the other the substances which it possesses and\r\nthe other lacks, and that this causes an increase of vital energy.\r\nBut it is unlikely that we have here to do merely with chemical\r\nsubstances, although these, of course, as the material basis of all\r\nvital processes, are indispensable; it seems to me more probable that\r\nthe vital units (biophors) themselves in their specific individuality\r\nmust play the chief part. But even this is saying very little, for we\r\nhave not yet reached an understanding of these processes, and if we\r\nwere not forced by the fact of plastogamy to the conclusion that this\r\nunion must have some use, no one would have been likely to postulate it\r\nas useful, still less as necessary. It has, of course, been frequently\r\nsuggested that multiplication by fission, if long-continued, results\r\nin 'exhaustion,' and that this is corrected by amphimixis, but who\r\ncan tell why this 'exhaustion' might not be remedied, and even more\r\neffectually remedied, by a fresh supply of fuel, that is, of food?\r\nOne might have thought that the vital processes would be thus more\r\nreadily recuperated than by the co-operative combination of two already\r\n'exhausted' cells. Two exhausted horses may perhaps be able to pull the\r\nload that one of them was no longer equal to, but in the case we are\r\nconsidering it is the combined burdens of two units that have to be\r\nborne, although each was no longer equal to its own share! That is more\r\nthan we can understand.\r\n\r\nZehnder has recently defined the effect of amphimixis as a\r\n'strengthening of the power of adaptation,' and he infers that the\r\n'digestive fistellæ' (Biophors) of two individuals, which have\r\nsomewhat different powers of digestion, are, when they combine, able\r\nto assimilate more kinds of food than either was able to assimilate\r\nby itself. But I confess that I do not see how an advantage for the\r\nwhole would be gained through this alone, since half of the digestive\r\nbiophors would have to work for the nutrition of the mass of the\r\nindividual _A_, the other half of the differently constituted biophors\r\nfor that of the individual _B_, and the nutritive capacity would thus\r\nremain exactly what it was before conjugation. Nevertheless I believe\r\nthat Zehnder was right in his supposition that conjugation is concerned\r\nwith strengthening the power of adaptation, and I have long maintained\r\nand defended this interpretation with regard to true amphimixis in\r\nnucleated organisms. In these cases it is quite obvious that the\r\ncommunication of fresh ids to the germ-plasm implies an augmentation\r\nof the variational tendencies, and thus an increase of the power\r\nof adaptation. Under certain circumstances this may be of _direct_\r\nadvantage to the individual which results from the amphimixis, but\r\nin most cases the advantage will be only an indirect one, which may\r\nnot necessarily be apparent in the lifetime of this one individual,\r\nbut may become so only in the course of generations and with the aid\r\nof selection. For amphimixis must bring together favourable as well\r\nas unfavourable variations, and the advantage it has for the species\r\nlies simply in the fact that the latter are weeded out in the struggle\r\nfor existence, and that by repetition of the process the unfavourable\r\nvariational tendencies are gradually eliminated more and more\r\ncompletely from the germ-plasm of the species.\r\n\r\nBut this cannot have been the efficient cause in the introduction of\r\namphimixis into the series of vital phenomena; the reason for this\r\nmust be found in some _direct_ advantage, such as that it improved and\r\nincreased the assimilating power, the growth, and the multiplication\r\nof the particular individual, so that it gained an advantage over\r\nindividuals which had not entered into conjugation. This advantage must\r\nexist, at least in the lower forms of conjugation, in pure plastogamy,\r\ni. e. in the mere coalescence of the protoplasmic bodies. But, as it\r\nseems to me, we have not yet clearly recognized what the advantage\r\nprecisely is; we do not yet see how such a mingling or combination\r\nof two plasms should every time be of advantage for the combined\r\nconjugate. If we assume with Zehnder that two kinds of 'nutritive'\r\nbiophors are brought together which differ slightly from each other\r\nin digestive capacity, three cases may occur. Either the food _a_,\r\nadequate for the animal _A_, is just as abundant as the food _b_,\r\nsuitable for the animal _B_, and then half the conjugated animal will\r\nbe nourished by means of the biophors _a_, the other half by means\r\nof the biophors _b_, and the state of matters is the same as it was\r\nbefore conjugation; or the food _b_ is more abundant than the food\r\n_a_, or conversely, and then the biophors _b_ will have to take the\r\nlarger share in the nourishment of the conjugate _A_ + _B_, and they\r\nwill therefore multiply more rapidly and the biophors _a_ will decrease\r\nrelatively in number. Nutrition and growth will then go on more slowly\r\nfor a time, but will soon attain to their former intensity. The\r\ncombined individual _A_ + _B_ has then certainly gained an advantage\r\nover the isolated animal _A_, and the living substance of _A_ which,\r\nif left to itself would probably have perished, can continue to live\r\nin combination with _B_. But in that case it is not obvious where\r\nthe advantage in the union can lie, as far as _B_ is concerned. An\r\nadvantage to _B_ only results if there be a combination not of _one_\r\nkind of biophor only, but of several or many kinds of biophors. If for\r\ninstance _A_, whose digestive biophors were weak, brought with it into\r\nthe partnership 'secretory' or nervous biophors stronger than those of\r\n_B_, then there would be an advantage for both in the combination, and\r\nit is thus that, in the meantime, I interpret the direct benefit which\r\nresults from pure plastogamy. This benefit must be the more important\r\nand far-reaching the longer multiplication by fission continues without\r\nthe occurrence of conjugation.\r\n\r\nWe thus reach what is perhaps a not wholly unsatisfactory conception of\r\namphimixis, in so far at least that we do not require to assume that\r\nthere has been a fundamental change in its significance between its\r\nexpression in the lowest organisms and in the higher and even highest\r\nforms. Everywhere it is the same advantage: an increase in the power of\r\nadaptation; but it sometimes finds expression directly in the product\r\nof conjugation, sometimes only indirectly, sooner or later, among the\r\ndescendants of the product.\r\n\r\nHow far below the Myxomycetes pure plastogamy reaches we do not know;\r\nwhether it also occurs among non-nucleated organisms (Haeckel's\r\nMonera) we cannot tell from experience, since these assumed organisms\r\nhave not yet been observed with certainty. Perhaps they all lie\r\nbelow the limits of visibility, and then we could never do more than\r\n_suppose_ that plastogamic processes occur among them. Logically and\r\npurely theoretically we may _suppose_ that amphimixis occurred first\r\nbetween the plasmic bodies of non-nucleated Monera, then between the\r\ncell-bodies of true cells, and finally between the nuclei of cells.\r\n\r\nLet us hold fast to what we have found to be probable, namely, that\r\nthe fusion of individually different simple organisms must or may\r\nbring about a direct advantage--a stimulation of the metabolism, and\r\nat the same time an improvement of the constitution in different\r\ndirections, and let us go on to the consideration of cell-fusion\r\ncombined with nuclear fusion, or complete amphimixis. In this something\r\nis added which we can recognize as an important advantage, namely,\r\nthe combination of two hereditary substances, and thus the union of\r\ntwo variation-complexes which, according to our view, is necessary if\r\ntransformation of species is to take place. In mere plastogamy such a\r\nunion of two hereditary masses could only take place in Monera, not in\r\nnucleated organisms. If then there are really unicellular organisms\r\nwhich exhibit plastogamy without karyogamy (certain Foraminifera),\r\nwe have a further proof that these processes of plasmic fusion imply\r\ndirect advantage, which is distinct from the indirect advantage lying\r\nin the mingling of two different hereditary contributions, since\r\nin these cases of plastogamy there is no demonstrable mingling of\r\nhereditary bodies, no karyogamy.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as karyogamy or nuclear fusion was associated with mere\r\nplastogamy, complete amphimixis could never be lost again, because it\r\nalone made it possible that there should be harmonious transformation\r\nand adaptation in organisms which were becoming ever more complex; the\r\nprimary effect of the mingling would be more and more transcended,\r\nsince, without amphimixis, transmutation with harmonious adaptation\r\nin all directions would be less and less possible as organisms became\r\nmore complex in structure. I have already referred to the manifold\r\ndetails in the structure and development of the lowest organisms which\r\nmake this conclusion appear luminous to us, but we can also infer the\r\nnecessity for an unceasingly active selection, from a quite different\r\nset of facts, namely, from what we know of rudimentary organs in Man.\r\n\r\nWe may regard Mankind as a species which has its local races and\r\nsub-races, but which is fixed in its essential characters, and only\r\nfluctuates hither and thither in individual variation in each sub-race,\r\njust like any other modern mammal, such as the marmot or the hare.\r\nNevertheless we know that Man, as regards certain fairly numerous\r\nparts, is continually and persistently varying in a definite direction.\r\nWiedersheim, in his book _On the Structure of Man_[23], enumerates a\r\nlong series of parts and organs of the human body, which are in process\r\nof gradual degeneration, and of which it may be predicted that they\r\nwill disappear from the human structure since they have lost functional\r\nsignificance. Among these dwindling structures are the two last ribs,\r\nthe eleventh and twelfth, while the thirteenth has already disappeared,\r\nand only occurs exceptionally as a small vestige in the adult human\r\nbeing of to-day. The series includes also the seventh cervical rib,\r\nthe _os centrale_ of the wrist, the wisdom teeth, and the vermiform\r\nappendix of the intestine. The last is much larger in many mammals,\r\nand represents an important part of the digestive apparatus, but in\r\nMan it has dwindled to an unimportant appendage, which is a source of\r\ndanger when foreign bodies (cherry stones and such like) lodge in it\r\nand set up inflammation. The variations in its length warrant us in\r\nconcluding that it is still in process of degeneration; its average\r\nlength is about 8½ cm., but it varies from 2 cm. to 23 cm. in length,\r\nand in about 25 per cent. of cases a partial or entire closing up of\r\nits opening into the intestine may be observed.\r\n\r\n[23] _Ueber den Bau des Menschen_, 2nd ed., Freiburg-i.-Br., 1893.\r\nTrans. London, 1896.\r\n\r\nWiedersheim enumerates nearly a hundred parts thus in process of\r\ndegeneration: this means that nearly a hundred structures in Man\r\nare at the present time in process of variation, and this could not\r\nbe so unless amphimixis were continually mingling the hereditary\r\ncontributions anew from generation to generation, so that the\r\nminus-variations of the parts in question, starting from the germ-plasm\r\nin which they arose at one time as chance variations, and confirmed in\r\ntheir direction by means of germinal selection, are gradually being\r\ntransmitted to all the germ-plasms of the species. We thus see that\r\neven in a period of species-life, which we may fairly call a period of\r\nconstancy, variations of a phyletic kind are continually in process,\r\nwhich could not become general without the co-operation of amphimixis.\r\n\r\nNow, we have already seen that personal selection plays no part, or, at\r\nleast, no important part in such degenerations, because the variations\r\nwhich are here concerned do not usually attain to selection value,\r\nbut it is just such variations proceeding with infinite slowness that\r\noccur in functionally important organs likewise, and in the progressive\r\nadvance of which personal selection and mutual adaptation probably play\r\na part, so that in this way we can understand why the preservation of\r\namphigony by natural selection must be effected. It is impossible--for\r\nobvious reasons--to name particular instances with certainty, as we\r\ncan do in the case of the rudimentary organs, but even on general\r\nconsiderations we might expect that among the incipient variations\r\nof the determinants of the germ-plasm there would be some which were\r\nin an ascending direction, and that among these there would be some\r\nwhich, advanced by germinal selection, would go on ascending until\r\nthey attained selection value. Wiedersheim reckons, for instance,\r\nthe gradually increasing differentiation of the cortical zone of the\r\nhuman brain among the parts which are still in process of ascending\r\nvariation, and he is probably right in doing so.\r\n\r\nBut if variations, so slow as to be unnoticeable, are still of abundant\r\noccurrence in Man, we have no reason to doubt that similar processes\r\nare going on in other animals; among the higher Vertebrates at least\r\nthere is hardly a species which does not exhibit regressive variations\r\neven now, and in many cases progressive variations also are occurring,\r\nalthough we cannot give definite proofs of this.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of fixity which most species have is, therefore,\r\nillusory; in reality they exhibit a slow flux, gradually setting aside\r\nthe superfluities they received from their ancestors, perfecting the\r\nimportant parts to more precise adaptation and greater functional\r\ncapacity, and at the same time endeavouring to maintain all the parts\r\nin constant harmony. We can understand that as long as this process of\r\ngradual perfecting goes on, amphimixis will not readily be given up.\r\nThose that retain it must always, in the long run, have the preference.\r\nMoreover, as we have seen, _it cannot be given up_, when it has existed\r\nthrough æons, because of the power of persistence which the germ-plasm\r\nhas gradually acquired in the course of such a long hereditary\r\nsuccession. It could only be given up if an advantage decisive as to\r\nsurvival were associated with its abandonment, such as can be actually\r\nrecognized in most cases of parthenogenesis, among animals at least.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion this indirect effect of amphimixis, that is, the\r\nincreasing of the possibilities of adaptation by new combinations of\r\nindividual variational tendencies, is the main one, while the direct\r\nnutritive effect of the two germ-cells upon one another is quite\r\nsubsidiary. In this opinion I find myself in opposition to the views of\r\nmany if not most naturalists, who assume that amphimixis has a direct,\r\nsometimes, indeed, only a direct effect, and believe that they can\r\nprove it by facts.\r\n\r\nIn support of this position it has been pointed out that allogamy, that\r\nis, the mingling of individuals of different ancestry, occurs even\r\namong lowly unicellulars, and then higher up among most organisms;\r\nbut the question has not been asked whether this mutual attraction of\r\nthe unlike really expresses a primary characteristic of organisms,\r\nand may not possibly be a secondary acquisition adapted to ensure the\r\noccurrence of amphimixis. If we examine the facts we find that even in\r\nthe lowly Algæ, such as _Pandorina_ and _Ulothrix_, only the migratory\r\ncells or swarm-spores of different cell-colonies conjugate with one\r\nanother, but not those of the same lineage, and this phenomenon may be\r\nobserved in many unicellular plants and animals. We are justified in\r\nconcluding from this that a fairly large degree of difference between\r\nthe conjugating gametes secures the best results, whether this result\r\nis to be looked for in a 'rejuvenation' or in an increased adaptive\r\ncapacity; but it is erroneous to regard the stronger attraction\r\nbetween individuals of different descent as a direct outcome of this.\r\nTo me, at least, it seems to be an adaptive arrangement. The whole\r\nof the long and complex phylogenetic history of the sex-cells, the\r\ngametes, shows clearly that we have here to deal with a succession of\r\nadaptations, and that the degree of attraction which obtains between\r\ngametes has gradually been increased and specialized in the course of\r\nthe phylogeny. I need only briefly recall what we have discussed in a\r\nformer lecture, that at first the copulating cells were exactly alike\r\nin appearance and size, that then one kind of cell became rather larger\r\nthan the other, and that only gametes which were thus different in size\r\nwere mutually attractive--the micro-gametes and the macro-gametes,\r\nor male and female germ-cells; we have seen that these differences\r\nbetween the two became more and more accentuated, that the female\r\ncell continued to grow larger than the male, and to accumulate more\r\nand more nutritive material for the building up of the young organism\r\nwhich arises from its union with the male cell, and that the male cells\r\nbecame smaller, but more numerous, as was essential if their chances of\r\nfinding the often remote female cell were not to disappear altogether.\r\nAnd besides, there are all the innumerable adaptations of the egg-cell\r\nto the countless special circumstances which obtain in the different\r\ngroups, and the innumerable varieties in the form of the sperm-cell,\r\nwith all its delicate and complicated adaptations to the special\r\nconditions under which the egg-cell can be reached and fertilized in\r\nthis or that group of organisms. Of a truth, he is past helping who\r\ndoes not regard with wonder and admiration the adaptations which have\r\nbeen worked out in this connexion in the course of evolution! But if\r\nall these details are adaptations, so is the beginning of the whole\r\nprocess of differentiation; allogamy, the attraction of conjugating\r\ncells of different lineage, is not a primary outcome of individual\r\ndiversity; gametes of different descent did not strongly attract each\r\nother of themselves, but they were equipped with a strong power of\r\nmutual attraction, because the union of very different individualities\r\nwas the more advantageous.\r\n\r\nThis is an important distinction, for the adaptation to allogamy is\r\nwidely distributed, and its latest manifestations have frequently\r\nbeen misunderstood in the same way as its beginnings. The widespread\r\noccurrence of allogamy has been interpreted as evidence in favour of\r\nthe rejuvenation theory, and the endeavour on Nature's part to secure\r\nthe union of the unlike has been associated with the hypothetical\r\n'rejuvenating' power of amphimixis, and regarded as a direct and\r\ninevitable outcome of this. That this view is erroneous we shall see\r\neven more clearly from what follows.\r\n\r\nAs among unicellular Algæ it is frequently only gametes of different\r\nlineage which conjugate, so among animals and plants there are numerous\r\ncases in which the union of nearly related gametes is more or less\r\nstrictly excluded, both by the prevention of self-fertilization\r\n(autogamy) in hermaphrodites, or by the prevention of inbreeding, that\r\nis, the continued pairing of near relatives. Now all the preventive\r\nmeasures which effect this are of a secondary nature; they are\r\nadaptations which result from the advantage involved in the mingling of\r\nunrelated germ-plasms, even though it sometimes seems as if they were\r\nan outcome of the primary nature of the germ-cells.\r\n\r\nThe primary result of the mutual chemical influence of the two\r\ngerm-cells upon one another is--apart from the impulse to development\r\nwhich the centrosphere of the sperm-cell supplies--as far as I see,\r\nonly the more favourable or the more unfavourable mingling of the\r\nbiophor- or determinant-variants, and the resulting increase or\r\ndecrease in adaptive capacity, which leads to the better thriving of\r\nthe offspring, or conversely to its degeneration. Everything else\r\nis secondary and depends upon adaptation, effected in very diverse\r\nways, to secure the most favourable mingling of the germ-plasms for\r\nthe particular species concerned. Undoubtedly the parental ids united\r\nthrough amphimixis have an effect upon each other, since throughout the\r\nbuilding up of the organism of the child the homologous determinants\r\nstruggle with one another for food, but they do not affect each other\r\nin the way that many prominent physiological and medical writers\r\nsuppose, namely, that the union of the parental germ-plasms sets up a\r\n'formative stimulus' which 'advances' or even 'greatly advances' the\r\nprocess of development in the egg.\r\n\r\nParthenogenetic development goes on just as rapidly, sometimes even\r\nmore rapidly than that of the fertilized ova of the same species! How\r\ncan the supposed 'formative stimulus' be so entirely dispensed with in\r\nthis case?\r\n\r\nOf course I am well aware that the two kinds of germ-cells have a\r\nstrong attraction for each other, and that the protoplasm of the ovum\r\nactually exhibits tremulous movement when the spermatozoon penetrates\r\nthrough the micropyle. I myself observed this in the case of the\r\nlamprey (_Petromyzon_) when Calberla instituted his investigations on\r\nthe fertilization of that animal, but has that anything to do with\r\na formative stimulus? Is it anything more than the result of the\r\nchemotactic stimulus exerted by the substance of the ovum upon that\r\nof the spermatozoon and conversely? And have we any ground for seeing\r\nanything more in this than an adaptation of the sex-cells to the\r\nnecessity of mutually finding each other out and thereafter combining?\r\nTwo quite different things are often confused with one another in this\r\nconnexion: the mutual attraction of the two kinds of sex-cells which\r\ntends to secure their union, and the results of this union. A more\r\nexact distinction is necessary between the effects and the advantages\r\nwhich allogamy brings in its train and the means by which it is secured\r\nin the different species.\r\n\r\nIf amphimixis really set up a 'formative' stimulus, and if the amount\r\nof this was regulated by the differences between the two parental\r\ngerm-plasms, then parthenogenesis, which implies the entire absence\r\nof the mingling of two parental cells, would necessarily be even less\r\nadvantageous than amphimixis between near relatives; but this is not\r\nthe case. Continued inbreeding leads in many cases to the degeneration\r\nof the descendants, and particularly to lessened fertility and even\r\nto complete sterility. Thus in my prolonged breeding experiments with\r\nwhite mice, which were later carried on by G. von Guaita, strict\r\ninbreeding, effected throughout twenty-nine generations, resulted in\r\na gradually diminishing fertility, and similar observations have been\r\nmade by Ritzema Bos and others. But why does not the same thing happen\r\nin pure parthenogenesis? My experiments in breeding parthenogenetic\r\nOstracods (_Cypris reptans_) shows that these crustaceans, in the\r\ncourse of the eighty generations which I have observed till now[24],\r\nhave lost nothing of their prolific fertility and vital power; and\r\nthe same is true in free nature of the rose-gall wasp (_Rhodites\r\nrosæ_), which enjoys the greatest fertility notwithstanding its purely\r\nparthenogenetic reproduction, the females not infrequently laying\r\na hundred eggs in a single bud. How does it happen that 'the mutual\r\ninfluence of two different hereditary substances which so powerfully\r\npromotes individual development' can be here altogether dispensed with?\r\nOnly because it does not really exist, except in the imagination of my\r\nopponents, still influenced by the old dynamic theory of fertilization.\r\n\r\n[24] The cultures were begun in 1884 and are still continued (March 6,\r\n1902), still multiplying as abundantly as at the outset. I reckon that\r\nthere are on an average five generations in a year, which means about\r\neighty generations in sixteen years.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, whence come the injurious results of inbreeding,\r\nif not from the union of two nearly related germ-plasms? They certainly\r\ndo arise from that cause, but it is not through a 'formative stimulus,'\r\n_too slight_ in this case, exercising a direct formative chemical\r\neffect upon the two hereditary substances, but through the indirect\r\ninfluences exerted by these _too similar_ hereditary contributions\r\nduring the development of the new individual. Lest it be imagined that\r\nI am tilting against windmills, I will refer to one of the numerous\r\nexamples of the evil effects of inbreeding which have been submitted\r\nto me as specially corroborative of the conception of amphimixis as a\r\n'formative stimulus' whose strength depends upon the difference between\r\nthe germ-substances. The renowned breeder, Nathusius, allowed the\r\nprogeny of a sow of the large Yorkshire breed, imported from England\r\nwhen with young, to reproduce by inbreeding for three generations. The\r\nresult was unfavourable, for the young were weakly in constitution\r\nand were not prolific. One of the last female animals, for instance,\r\nwhen paired with its own uncle--known to be fertile with sows of a\r\ndifferent breed--produced a litter of six, and a second litter of five\r\nweakly piglings. But when Nathusius paired the same sow with a boar of\r\na small black breed, which boar had begotten seven to nine young when\r\npaired with sows of his own breed, the sow of the large Yorkshire breed\r\nproduced in the first litter twenty-one and in the second eighteen\r\npiglings.\r\n\r\nHow could this really remarkable difference in the fertility of the\r\nsow in question be the result of a formative stimulus, exercised by\r\nthe sperm-cells of the unrelated boar upon the ova of the female\r\nanimal? If the progeny of the sow had been more fertile than herself,\r\nthen we should have been at least logically justified in concluding\r\nthat this was the case, but it is not intelligible that the egg-cells\r\nof this mother sow should be increased twice or three times because\r\nthey were fertilized by a new kind of sperm as they glided from the\r\novary. The number of ova which are liberated from the ovary depends\r\nin the first instance upon the number of mature ova contained in\r\nit; and unless we are to make the highly improbable assumption that\r\nthe crossing with the strange boar had as an immediate result the\r\nmaturing of a large number of ova, we must look elsewhere than in the\r\novary of the animal for the cause of this sudden fertility, possibly\r\nin chance circumstances which we are unaware of and which make the\r\novary occasionally more productive, possibly however in the fact that\r\ninbreeding may have brought about various slight structural variations\r\nin the animal, and among these some which made the fertilization of\r\nthe abundantly produced ova by the sperm of the related boar less\r\neasy, and caused it to fail more frequently. As will be readily\r\nunderstood, I cannot say anything definite on this point, but we know\r\nthat very slight variations in the sperm-cell or the ovum may make\r\nfertilization difficult, or may even prevent it. I need only remind\r\nyou of the interesting experiments in hybridization which Pflüger\r\nand Born made with Batrachians nearly thirty years ago, which showed\r\nthat in two nearly related species of frog the ova of the species A\r\nwere frequently fertilized by the sperms of the species B, but not\r\nconversely, the ova of the species B by the sperms of A. This is the\r\ncase, for instance, with the green edible frog (_Rana esculenta_),\r\nand the brown grass-frog (_Rana fusca_), and the reason of this\r\ndissimilarity in the effectiveness of the sperm lies simply in 'rough\r\nmechanical conditions,' in the width of the micropyle of the ovum,\r\nand the thickness of the head of the spermatozoon. If each species\r\npossesses a micropyle which is exactly wide enough to admit of the\r\npassage of the spermatozoon of its own species, another species will\r\nonly be able to fertilize these eggs if the head of its spermatozoon\r\nbe not larger than that of the first species. Thus, as experiment has\r\nproved, the spermatozoa of _Rana fusca_ fertilize the ova of almost\r\nall other related species, for they have the thinnest head and it is\r\nat the same time very pointed. In this case, therefore, it depends\r\nupon the microscopic structure of the ovum whether fertilization can\r\ntake place or not, and we can imagine that similar or perhaps other\r\nminute variations had taken place in the ova in the case of Nathusius's\r\nsow, and that these made it difficult for the sperms of boars of the\r\nsame family to effect fertilization. These variations may have arisen\r\nas a result of the continued inbreeding, because the same ids were\r\nconstantly being brought together in the fertilized ova, and thus any\r\nunfavourable directions of variations which existed were strengthened.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in this way alone can the injurious effect of\r\ninbreeding be made intelligible. From both parents identical ids meet\r\nin the fertilized ovum, in greater numbers the longer inbreeding\r\ncontinues, for at the maturation of every germ-cell the number of\r\ndifferent ids is diminished by a few, and their number must therefore\r\ngradually decrease, and it is conceivable that ultimately it may\r\nsink to one kind of id, that is, that the germ-plasm may then consist\r\nentirely of identical ids. If chance variations of certain determinants\r\nin unfavourable directions occur in some of the ids composing the\r\ngerm-plasm, these are brought together in the offspring from both the\r\nmaternal and the paternal side, and will occur in an increasing number\r\nof ids the longer the inbreeding has gone on, that is, the smaller the\r\nnumber of different ids has become. The unfavourable variation-tendency\r\nis therefore persisted in, and its influence upon the development of a\r\nnew descendant will be the greater the larger the number of identical\r\nids with these unfavourable variations. It is obvious that the crossing\r\nof an animal, which is thus, so to speak, degenerating slightly, with\r\na member of an unrelated family must immediately have a good effect\r\nupon the descendants, for in this way quite different ids with other\r\nvariations of their determinants are introduced into the inbred\r\ngerm-plasm which had become too monotonous.\r\n\r\nFrom this theoretical interpretation of the injurious consequences of\r\ninbreeding we may at once infer that not every inbreeding necessarily\r\nimplies degeneration, for the occurrence of unfavourable variational\r\ntendencies in the germ-plasm is presupposed as the starting-point of\r\ndegeneration, and if these do not exist there can be no degeneration.\r\nThis harmonizes with the fact that the evil effects of inbreeding are\r\nobserved _to vary greatly in amount, and may not occur at all_. But\r\nthey are greatest in breeds artificially selected by man, which have\r\nlong been under unnatural, directly influential conditions, and are\r\nalso removed from the purifying influence of natural selection. In such\r\ncases, therefore, there is every probability that diverse unfavourable\r\nvariational tendencies in the determinants will occur.\r\n\r\nBut how are we to understand the fact that pure parthenogenesis\r\nmay last through innumerable generations, and yet no degeneration\r\nsets in? I believe very simply. In this case too, the same ids\r\nwhich were peculiar to the mother of the race are contained in the\r\ndescendants, but they do not diminish in number, for in pure and\r\nnormal parthenogenesis, such as that of _Cypris reptans_, the second\r\nmaturation-division of the ovum does not take place, and this is\r\nprecisely the nuclear division which effects reduction. In addition,\r\nthe introduction of identical ids, which must take place in the case of\r\ninbreeding at every amphimixis, does not occur, and, what is certainly\r\nof great importance, all these cases are old species, living under\r\nnatural conditions--the same conditions under which they lived as\r\namphigonous species, and not newly formed breeds under artificial\r\nconditions, as has probably always been the case in the experiments in\r\ninbreeding.\r\n\r\nIt is true that even in old species, living in a state of nature,\r\nunfavourable variations may arise in the germ-plasm, and may go on\r\nincreasing during purely parthenogenetic multiplication, for the ids\r\nwith unfavourably varying determinants will no longer be set aside\r\nby means of reducing division. But those individuals in which the\r\nunfavourable variational tendency increases until it has attained\r\nselection-value will be subject to selection and will be gradually\r\neliminated; indeed, the weeding out of the inferior individuals will be\r\nmore drastic here than where amphigony obtains, because in this case\r\nall the offspring of one mother are nearly alike, so that the whole\r\nprogeny is exterminated if the mother varies unfavourably.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a transformation in a favourable direction, an\r\nadaptation to new conditions of life, as far at least as that implies\r\nthe simultaneous variation and harmonious co-adaptation of many parts,\r\ncannot, as far as I can see, be effected in the course of purely\r\nparthenogenetic reproduction, nor can a degeneration of complicated\r\nparts which have become superfluous. For both these changes, in my\r\nopinion, require that the ids of the germ-plasm should be frequently\r\nmingled afresh, since apart from this there cannot be a harmonious\r\nreadjustment of complicated structures, nor can a uniform degeneration\r\naffecting all parts set in. As an example of this last case we may take\r\nthat organ which became functionless in the purely parthenogenetic\r\nspecies of Ostracods when amphigonous reproduction was given up--the\r\nsperm-pocket or receptaculum of the female. All these species still\r\npossess an unaltered receptaculum seminis, a large pear-shaped bladder\r\nwith a long, narrow, spirally coiled entrance-duct, very well adapted\r\nfor allowing the enormous spermatozoa of the males to make their way\r\nin singly, and to arrange themselves within the receptacle side by\r\nside in the most beautiful order, like a long ribbon, and finally to\r\nmigrate out again singly to fertilize the liberated ova. In _Cypris\r\nreptans_ and several other species, however, no males have been found\r\nin any of the places which have been carefully searched, and the\r\nreceptaculum of the female is always found to be empty. Nevertheless\r\nit shows no hint of degeneration. It is possible enough that, as in\r\n_Apus cancriformis_, which is of similar habit, the males have become\r\nextinct in most colonies of these species, but that nevertheless they\r\ndo occur here and there from time to time in the area inhabited by the\r\nspecies, and if this should prove to be the case, it would confirm the\r\nconclusion, which is very probable on other grounds, that the pure\r\nparthenogenesis of these species has not existed in most of their\r\nhabitats for a long time, speaking phylogenetically. For this reason we\r\nmust not over-estimate the significance of the complete persistence of\r\nthe receptaculum even with exclusively parthenogenetic reproduction.\r\nIt proves, however, that degeneration of a superfluous organ does\r\nnot necessarily set in even after hundreds of generations, and in\r\nthis fact there is certainly a corroboration of the view that it is\r\n'chance' germinal variations which give the impulse to degeneration.\r\nThese first induce a downgrade variation through germinal selection,\r\nand this, if it concerns an organ of no importance to the survival of\r\nthe species, is not hindered in its progress by personal selection.\r\nWhether degeneration of the receptaculum would have occurred in\r\nthese parthenogenetic species if they had retained even a periodic\r\nsexual reproduction, as is actually the case in the generations of\r\nthe alternately parthenogenetic and sexually reproducing Aphides,\r\nwe cannot decide, since we know nothing in either case as to the\r\nlength of time that parthenogenesis has prevailed among them, nor\r\nhave we any method of computing the number of generations that must\r\nelapse before a superfluous organ begins to vacillate. We only know\r\nthat the parthenogenetic generations of Aphides no longer possess\r\na receptaculum, while other forms with alternating bi-sexual and\r\nparthenogenetic modes of reproduction, which are in this respect\r\npossibly more modern, e. g. some of the gall-wasps, possess one similar\r\nto that of the Ostracods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79 (repeated).

Highly magnified.]\r\n\r\nI must refer to one other case of parthenogenesis, since it has been\r\nhitherto regarded as a formidable puzzle for the germ-plasm theory,\r\nand has only recently found its solution, I mean the facultative\r\nparthenogenesis of the queen-bee. As the 'male' eggs of the bee remain\r\nunfertilized, and yet undergo two reducing divisions, which must\r\ndiminish the number of ids in the ovum-nucleus by a half, the number of\r\nids in the germ-plasm of the bee must be steadily decreasing, and this\r\nstate of things has therefore been regarded by some English biologists\r\nas convincing evidence of the untenability of the conception of ids and\r\nof the whole germ-plasm theory. Apparently, indeed, it is contradictory\r\nto the theory, and we must inquire whether the contradiction is merely\r\nan _apparent_ one, disappearing when the facts are more precisely\r\nknown. It was mainly on this ground that I instituted the researches\r\ncarried out by Dr. Petrunkewitsch, the results of which I have already\r\nin part communicated in a former lecture. These results confirmed\r\nthe previous conclusions that the 'male' eggs of the queen-bee\r\nremain unfertilized, that two reducing divisions occur, and that in\r\nconsequence the ovum-nucleus only contains half the normal number of\r\nchromosomes. That these increase again by division to the normal\r\nnumber does not save the theory, for only _identical_ ids can arise in\r\nthis way, while the significance of the multiplicity of the ids lies\r\nmainly in their difference. The halving of the number of ids in each\r\n'male' ovum would necessarily lead, if not to a permanent diminution\r\nin the number of ids, at least to a monotony of the germ-plasm, since\r\nthe number of _different_ ids would be steadily decreasing and the\r\nnumber of _identical_ ids as steadily increasing. This too would be a\r\ncontradiction of the theory. But Dr. Petrunkewitsch's investigations\r\nhave shown that, of the four nuclei which are formed by the two\r\nreducing divisions, the two middle ones (Fig. 79, _K_ 2 and _K_ 3)\r\nrecombine with one another, and fuse into a single nucleus, and that\r\nfrom this copulation-nucleus in the course of development the primitive\r\ngerm-cells of the embryo arise. Now all the ids which were originally\r\npresent in the nucleus of the immature ovum may be reunited in this\r\n'polar copulation-nucleus' if the two nuclei _K_ 2 and _K_ 3 turned\r\ntowards each other in Fig. 79 contain different ids. That this is the\r\ncase cannot of course be seen from the ids themselves, but it seems to\r\nme extremely probable, since it is dissimilar poles of the two nuclear\r\nspindles which here unite, namely, the lower pole (daughter-nucleus) of\r\nthe upper spindle and the upper pole of the lower spindle. In the first\r\ndirective or polar spindle there lay thirty-two chromosomes, which had\r\nincreased by duplication from sixteen, and of these sixteen passed over\r\ninto the first polar nucleus, while sixteen formed the basis of the\r\nsecond directive spindle. These two sets of sixteen chromosomes must\r\nhave been quite similar, since the two sets arose by division of the\r\nsixteen mother-chromosomes. Let us call the chromosomes _a_, _b_, _c_,\r\n_d-q_, then similar sets of chromosomes must have been contained in the\r\ntwo nuclear spindle figures depicted in Fig. 79 at the beginning of the\r\ndivision, and eight of these went to each daughter-nucleus. Now, if\r\n_a-k_ migrated to the upper pole of the spindle and _l-q_ to the lower\r\npole, then the union of _K_ 2 with _K_ 3 would bring together again\r\nall the ids that had before been present. In consideration of this I\r\npredicted to Dr. Petrunkewitsch that this copulation-product might be\r\nthe basis of the formation of the germ-cells in the drone-bee, and his\r\npainstaking and difficult researches have confirmed this prediction,\r\nstrange though it may seem, that the male germ-cells have a different\r\norigin from the female germ-cells. But this discovery gives a strong\r\nsupport to the germ-plasm theory. It may, of course, be objected that\r\nthe assumed regular distribution of the ids in the two daughter-nuclei\r\ncannot be proved, but we know already that this dividing apparatus\r\ndoes _very exact_ work, and we are at liberty to assume it in an even\r\nhigher degree. Moreover, what other interpretation of the unexpected\r\ndevelopment of the germ-cells discovered by Petrunkewitsch could be\r\ngiven if this had to be rejected? A clearer proof of the individual\r\ndifferences of ids and of their essential importance could not be\r\ndesired, than lies in the fact that in the 'male' eggs of the queen-bee\r\na different and novel mode of germ-cell formation is instituted, after\r\nhalf the ids have been irrecoverably withdrawn from the ovum-nucleus.\r\nWe see from this that for individual development a duplication of\r\nindividual ids may suffice, but that for the further development of the\r\nspecies a retention of the diversity of the ids is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXX\r\n\r\nINBREEDING, PARTHENOGENESIS, ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION, AND THEIR\r\nCONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\n The separation of the sexes exists even among the\r\n Protozoa--Conditions determining the occurrence of\r\n Hermaphroditism--Tape-worms, Cirrhipeds--Primordial males--Advantages\r\n of parthenogenesis--Alternation with bi-sexual generations--In\r\n Gall-wasps--In Aphides--Cross-fertilization secured in\r\n plants--Self-fertilization is avoided whenever possible--The\r\n mechanism of fertilization and the mingling of germ-plasms must\r\n be clearly distinguished from one another--Cases of persistent\r\n self-fertilization--The effects of inbreeding compared with those\r\n of parthenogenesis--The effect of purely asexual reproduction--In\r\n sea-wracks--In lichens and fungi--In cultivated plants--Degeneration\r\n of the sex-organs--Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that continued inbreeding must make the germ-plasm\r\nmonotonous, and therefore unplastic as regards the requirements of\r\nadaptation. Accordingly, we found that the gametes of many unicellulars\r\nare so constituted that they only possess a power of attraction for\r\ngametes of a different lineage, not for those of their own stock. Among\r\nmulticellular organisms the most intense mode of inbreeding is to be\r\nfound in the uninterrupted self-fertilization of hermaphrodites: in\r\nsuch cases the monotony of the germ-plasm must reach extreme expression\r\nmore readily than in the case of ordinary inbreeding. We can thus\r\nunderstand why, in the scale of organisms, there is such an early\r\noccurrence of gonochorism, the separation of the species into male and\r\nfemale individuals. Even among unicellular plants or Protophytes this\r\noccurs occasionally, as it does in the Vorticellids among Infusorians.\r\n\r\nIn the Metazoa and Metaphyta the separation of the sexes finds emphatic\r\nexpression; it is absent from no important group, and in many, such\r\nas, for instance, among the Vertebrates, it has become the absolutely\r\nnormal condition, with hardly any exception. But in many divisions of\r\nthe animal and plant kingdoms hermaphroditism also plays an important\r\npart, as, for instance, in terrestrial snails and in flowering plants.\r\n\r\nObviously the sexual adaptations of a species are definitely related\r\nto the conditions of its life, and, though Nature's endeavour to\r\nprevent inbreeding and to secure cross-fertilization is evidenced by\r\nthe occurrence of separate sexes in such a multitude of forms yet\r\nin many cases gonochorism has been relinquished, and always where\r\nthis was necessitated by the conditions of life to which the group\r\nconcerned was subject. In such a case inbreeding is regulated as\r\nfar as possible, for instance, by an arrangement which ensures that\r\nindividuals shall be crossed at least from time to time. But cases of\r\nexclusive and constant self-fertilization do also seem to occur, and\r\neven these may be brought into harmony with our conception, according\r\nto which cross-fertilization is an advantage, but only an advantage\r\nwhich must be weighed against others, and which may eventually be given\r\nup in favour of greater advantages. This occurrence of persistent\r\nautogamy can no more be reconciled with the rejuvenation theory than\r\ncan continuous parthenogenesis, because, according to this theory,\r\nthe mingling of different individuals is a _sine qua non_, for the\r\ncontinued life of the species.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me here to discuss in detail all the deviations\r\nfrom pure gonochorism or bi-sexuality which occur in nature, but I must\r\nat least attempt to take a general survey, and to arrange the chief\r\nphenomena of these various modes of 'sexual reproduction' in an orderly\r\nscheme. I must take a survey of both plants and animals, but I shall\r\ngive the precedence to animals, as being to me more familiar ground.\r\n\r\nWhere do we find, in the animal kingdom, that Nature has departed from\r\ngonochorism, from the separation of the sexes, and for what reasons was\r\nthis departure necessary? And further, what means does Nature take to\r\ncompensate for this renunciation of the simplest method of securing the\r\ncontinual cross-fertilization of individuals?\r\n\r\nLet us glance over the animal kingdom with special reference to these\r\nquestions: we find that hermaphroditism prevails chiefly among species\r\nwhich at maturity have lost their power of free locomotion, and have\r\nbecome sedentary, such as oysters, barnacles among Crustaceans, the\r\nBryozoa, and the sea-squirts (Ascidians) which are fixed to the rocks\r\nat the bottom of the sea. For forms such as these it must often have\r\nbeen advantageous that each individual could function both as male\r\nand as female, especially when it was capable of self-fertilization,\r\nsince individuals which settled down singly, or in very small numbers\r\ntogether, would not be lost as regards the persistence of the species.\r\nThe continuance of the species is thus better secured than it would\r\nbe by separation of the sexes, because in the latter case it might\r\nfrequently have happened that the animals which had settled beside\r\neach other by chance were of the same sex, and would therefore remain\r\nunfertile. But many of these species do not fertilize themselves, but\r\nfertilize each other mutually; and this, too, carries a great advantage\r\nwith it, because in sedentary animals the sperms will fertilize\r\ntwice as many individuals, if each contains eggs, than if half were\r\nexclusively male. It is thus to some extent an economy of sperms, but\r\nat the same time also of ova, which is effected by hermaphroditism:\r\nthe result is that these valuable products are wasted as little as\r\npossible. On this account we find that not only sedentary, but also\r\nsluggish, slow-moving animals are equipped with male and female organs\r\nof reproduction, as, for instance, all our terrestrial snails. They\r\nfertilize each other mutually: when two meet it is always as males and\r\nfemales, and notwithstanding the sluggishness of movement, it is not\r\nlikely to happen that a snail does not attain to reproduction because\r\nit has not found a mate. The same is true of the earthworms, which\r\nare likewise not adapted for making long journeys in search of the\r\nopposite sex; they, and the leeches also, function as male and female\r\nsimultaneously, while their nearest relatives, the marine Chætopods,\r\nare of separate sexes, which may be associated with their much greater\r\npower of free movement in the water.\r\n\r\nIn these cases self-fertilization is often absolutely excluded; it\r\nmay be physically impossible, and hermaphroditism therefore secures\r\ncross-fertilization in such cases just as effectively as if the sexes\r\nwere separate. Similarly, in many hermaphrodite flowers, as we have\r\nalready seen, the pollen is so constituted and so placed within the\r\nflower that it cannot of itself make its way to the stigma. In oysters,\r\nfor instance, the young animal is male, and liberates into the water an\r\nenormous quantity of minute spermatozoa, and therewith fertilizes the\r\nolder individuals, functioning only as females, which have grown upon\r\nthe same bank. At a later stage of its development the oyster which was\r\nmale becomes female, and produces only ova. This state of affairs, of\r\nwhich I shall shortly mention another case, has been called _temporary_\r\nhermaphroditism. In this case not only is self-fertilization excluded,\r\nbut close inbreeding also, since it is always a young generation\r\nfunctioning simultaneously as males that mingles with an older\r\ngeneration which has become female.\r\n\r\nIt is quite otherwise with parasites which live singly within the body\r\nof a host: for these it was indispensably necessary that they should\r\nnot only produce both kinds of germ-cells, but that they should unite\r\nthe two kinds in fertilization, and they therefore possess the power\r\nof self-fertilization. Thus, in the urinary bladder of the frog, there\r\noccurs a flat-worm (_Polystomum integerrimum_) which possesses special\r\norgans for pairing with another individual, but which is also capable\r\nof self-fertilization when, as frequently occurs, it has no companion\r\nin its place of abode. But this self-fertilization is always liable to\r\nbe interrupted by cross-fertilization, for not infrequently there are\r\ntwo, three, or even four such parasites within the bladder of a single\r\nfrog.\r\n\r\nIn the tape-worms, too, cross-fertilization is not excluded, for there\r\nare often two or more of these animals together in the intestine\r\nof a host at the same time. But even where there is only one,\r\nself-fertilization on the part of the joints, that is, the sexual\r\nindividuals, is prevented, and by the same device, metaphorically\r\nspeaking, as in the case of the oyster, for in each joint the male\r\nelements mature first and the female elements afterwards. In certain\r\nparasitic Isopods of the genus _Anilocra_ and related forms close\r\ninbreeding is prevented in the same way--by a difference in the period\r\nat which the two sets of gonads in the hermaphrodite individual become\r\nmature (dichogamy).\r\n\r\nThis is secured in a different way in Crustaceans which have grown to\r\nmaturity in a sedentary state, like the Cirrhipeds. These animals,\r\nknown as 'acorn-shells' and 'barnacles,' are sedentary, sometimes\r\non rocks and stones, sometimes on a movable object, the keel of a\r\nship, floating pieces of wood, cork, or cane, or sometimes attached\r\nto turtles or whales, and although they generally occur in great\r\nnumbers together, they are probably only able to fertilize each\r\nother occasionally, and are therefore essentially dependent upon\r\nself-fertilization. But Charles Darwin discovered long ago that many\r\nof them, notwithstanding their hermaphroditism, have males which are\r\nsmall, dwarf-like, and very mobile organisms, destined only for a\r\nvery brief life. These seemed quite superfluous in association with\r\nhermaphrodite animals, and they have therefore long been regarded as\r\nvestigial males, as the last remnant, so to speak, of a past stage of\r\nthe modern Cirrhipeds, in which the sexes were separate. It is obvious,\r\nhowever, that we must now attribute to them a deeper significance,\r\nfor these so-called 'primordial males,' although extremely transitory\r\ncreatures without mouth or intestine, represent a means of securing\r\nthe cross-fertilization of the species. What importance nature\r\nattaches to their preservation is shown especially by the parasitic\r\nCirrhipeds which have been so carefully studied by Fritz Müller\r\nand Yves Delage--those sac-like Rhizocephalidæ or root-crustaceans\r\nwhich are altogether disfigured by parasitism. The fully developed\r\nanimals are hermaphrodite and live partly in, partly upon crabs and\r\nhermit-crabs (Fig. 112, _C_, _Sacc_). These hermaphrodites indeed\r\nfertilize themselves, but in their youth they are of distinct sexes,\r\nand the females are so constituted that they lay eggs for the first\r\ntime just when the males of the current year are appearing. Thus the\r\nfirst batch of eggs liberated by the females are fertilized by the\r\nminute free-swimming 'primordial males,' but after that the females\r\nthemselves develop testes, and then fertilize themselves; the males\r\ndie very soon after copulation, and only appear the following year\r\nin a new generation. They are therefore far from being mere historic\r\nreminiscences, vestiges of the early history of the modern species,\r\nfor they are the instruments of a regular cross-fertilization of\r\nthe species, and therefore of a constant mingling of new ids in\r\nthe germ-plasm. This is not the place to discuss the marvellous\r\nlife-history of these parasites in detail; I can only say that when\r\nwe inquire into the whole story, and appreciate the difficulties\r\nassociated with the persistence of these 'primordial males,' we can no\r\nlonger doubt that crossing is an indispensable feature of amphimixis--a\r\nfeature which must at least occasionally occur if amphimixis is to\r\nretain its significance. This is shown, it seems to me, especially by\r\nthese numerous instances of what we may call compulsory retention of\r\nephemeral males in hermaphrodite, self-fertilizing animals; it follows\r\nalso from the theory, for with continued self-fertilization all the ids\r\nin the germ-plasm of an individual would tend to become identical, and\r\nthe mingling of two germ-plasms which contained _identical_ ids would,\r\nat least according to the germ-plasm theory, have no meaning at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112 (repeated).

Adaptations quite analogous to these are found\r\nin relation to parthenogenesis, and it will repay us to give a brief\r\nsummary of these.\r\n\r\nParthenogenesis effects a very considerable increase in the fertility\r\nof a species, and in this increase the reason for its introduction\r\namong natural phenomena obviously lies. By the occurrence of\r\nparthenogenesis, the number of ova produced by a particular colony of\r\nanimals may be doubled, because each individual is a female, and as the\r\nmultiplication increases in geometrical ratio a few parthenogenetic\r\ngenerations result in a number of descendants enormously in excess of\r\nthose produced by bi-sexual reproduction. We can therefore understand\r\nwhy parthenogenesis should obtain among animals whose conditions of\r\nlife are favourable only for a short time, and are then uncertain and\r\ndangerous for a long period. This is the case with the water-fleas,\r\nthe Daphnids (see Figs. 57 and 58), whose habitats--pools, ponds, and\r\nmarshes--often dry up altogether in summer, or freeze in winter, so\r\nthat it becomes almost if not quite impossible for the colonies to go\r\non living, and the preservation of the species can only be secured\r\nby the production of hard-shelled 'lasting' eggs, which sink to the\r\nbottom, dry up in the mud, or become frozen, or at least remain latent\r\nin a sort of slumber. As soon as the favourable conditions reappear,\r\nyoung animals which emerge from the eggs are all females and reproduce\r\nparthenogenetically, so that after a few days there is a numerous\r\nprogeny swimming freely about, which in their turn are all females,\r\nand reproduce after the same manner. In many Daphnids this goes on\r\nfor a series of generations, and there thus arises an enormous number\r\nof animals, which may fill a marsh so densely that, by drawing a\r\nfine net a few times through the water, one can draw out a veritable\r\nanimal soup. In our ponds and lakes these little Crustaceans form the\r\nfundamental food of numerous fishes. But notwithstanding the enormous\r\nhavoc wrought among them by enemies, large numbers remain at the end\r\nof a favourable season, and these produce the lasting eggs, _after\r\nfertilization_. For shortly before the end of the season males appear\r\namong the progeny of the hitherto purely parthenogenetic females.\r\nAlthough each female will only produce a few of these 'lasting' eggs,\r\nwhich require fertilization and are richly supplied with yolk, the\r\nwhole number in each colony is a very large one, because the number of\r\nindividuals is very large; and it must be so, since the eggs, though\r\nsecure against cold and desiccation, are very imperfectly protected\r\nagainst the numerous enemies which may do them injury.\r\n\r\nOf course the number of individuals which form a colony may vary\r\ngreatly in the different species, and the same is true of the number\r\nof parthenogenetic generations which precede the bi-sexual generation.\r\nI have already shown in detail that this depends precisely on the\r\naverage duration of the favourable conditions, so that, for instance,\r\na species which lives in large lake-basins will produce many purely\r\nparthenogenetic generations before the bi-sexual one, which only\r\nappears towards autumn, while species which live in quickly-drying\r\npools have only a few parthenogenetic generations, and the true\r\npuddle-dwellers give rise to males and sexual females along with the\r\nparthenogenetic females as early as the second generation.\r\n\r\nWe thus find in the Daphnids an alternation, regulated and made\r\nnormal by natural selection, of purely parthenogenetic with bi-sexual\r\ngenerations, and the result is that the uniformity of the germ-plasm,\r\nwhich is the necessary consequence of pure parthenogenesis, is\r\ninterrupted after a longer or shorter series of generations by\r\nthe occurrence of amphimixis. That the number of parthenogenetic\r\ngenerations may be so varied, though with a definite norm for each\r\nspecies, indicates again that amphimixis is not an absolute condition\r\nof the maintenance of life, not an indispensable rejuvenation, designed\r\nto counteract the exhaustion of vital force--whether this be meant\r\nin a transcendental sense or otherwise--but that it is an important\r\nadvantage calculated to keep the species at its highest level, and that\r\nits influence appears whether it occurs in the species regularly, or\r\nfrequently, or only rarely.\r\n\r\nThis kind of alternation of generations, that is, the alternation\r\nbetween unisexual (female) and bi-sexual generations, has been called\r\nheterogony. In the Daphnids, certainly, a difference in form between\r\nthe parthenogenetic and the bi-sexual generation does not exist,\r\nfor the same females which produce eggs requiring fertilization can\r\nalso produce parthenogenetic ova, although these are very different\r\nfrom each other, as we have already seen. The difference between\r\ngenerations, therefore, does not lie in their structure, but in their\r\ntendency to parthenogenetic or to amphigonous reproduction, and in the\r\nabsence or presence of male individuals. There are, however, other\r\ncases of alternation of generations in which the different generations\r\ndiverge from each other in structure. One of the most remarkable of\r\nthese is that of the gall-wasps (Cynipidæ). In many of these little\r\nHymenoptera, which form galls on leaves, blossoms, buds, and roots,\r\nespecially of the oak, two generations occur annually, one in summer,\r\nthe other in early spring, or even in the middle of winter. The latter\r\nconsists of females only and reproduces parthenogenetically. We can\r\nreadily understand this from the point of view of adaptation to\r\nparticular conditions, since the young wasps which emerge from their\r\ngalls in winter, or in the middle of a raw spring, are exposed to many\r\ndangers and are terribly decimated before they can succeed in laying\r\ntheir eggs in the proper place on the plant. Moreover, much precious\r\ntime would be lost by the mutual search of the sexes for each other,--a\r\nsearch which would often be entirely without result. Thus the wingless\r\nfemale of _Biorhiza renum_ (Fig. 124, _A_), which is not unlike a plump\r\nant, attempts, without taking food, and often interrupted by a spell\r\nof cold or a snowstorm, to reach a neighbouring oak-shrub, creeps up\r\non it, and lays its eggs in the heart of a winter bud, whose hard\r\nprotecting scales it laboriously perforates by means of its short,\r\nthick, sharp ovipositor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124. Alternation of generations in a Gall-wasp.\r\n_A_, winter generation (_Biorhiza renum_). _B_ and _C_, summer\r\ngenerations (_Trigonaspis crustalis_). _B_, male. _C_, female. After\r\nAdler.]\r\n\r\nAfter it has succeeded in sinking its ovipositor into the heart of the\r\nbud, it goes on working for hours, piercing the delicate tissue with a\r\nmultitude of fine canals, one close beside the other, and then deposits\r\nan egg in each of these. The whole detailed piece of work requires,\r\naccording to Adler, uninterrupted active exertion for about three days,\r\neven though in the end only two buds may be filled with eggs. If at\r\nevery egg-laying the arrival of a male had to be waited for, an even\r\nlarger number of females would fall victims to the unfavourable weather\r\nand other dangers, while at the same time the number of emerging\r\nfemales could be only half as large as it is. It is obvious that in\r\nthis case parthenogenesis is of very great advantage.\r\n\r\nIn summer the climatic conditions are incomparably more favourable for\r\nthe gall-wasps, and accordingly we find that the summer generation\r\nis bi-sexual, but, strangely enough, is so different from the winter\r\ngeneration that the relationship of the two forms was for a long time\r\noverlooked. The antennæ, the legs, and particularly the ovipositor,\r\nthe whole shape of the animal, its size, the length of the abdomen,\r\nthe structure of the thorax, and many other points are so different\r\nthat as long as the structural features afforded the only criterion\r\nof relationship, the systematists quite naturally placed the winter\r\nand summer forms in different genera. It was only when Dr. H. Adler\r\nsucceeded in breeding the one form from the other that people were\r\nconvinced that such marked differences in structure could be found\r\nwithin the same life-cycle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125. The two kinds of Galls formed by the species.\r\n_A_, the many-chambered galls produced by the parthenogenetic\r\nwinter form, _Biorhiza renum_. _B_, those produced on oak-leaves by\r\n_Trigonaspis crustalis_, the bi-sexual form. After Adler.]\r\n\r\nBut we see here quite clearly why the two generations had to become so\r\ndifferent; simply because the winter generation had to adapt itself\r\nto different conditions from the summer generation, above all as to\r\nthe laying of its eggs within the tissues of a plant of a different\r\nconstitution. In our example, the winter form _Biorhiza renum_ pierces\r\nthe terminal buds of the oak, and lays in each of them a large number\r\nof eggs, sometimes as many as 300, so that a very large gall is\r\nformed, in which a great many larvæ can find food, and grow on to the\r\npupa-stage. From this spongy gall, something like an inverted onion in\r\nshape, and about the size of a walnut (Fig. 125, _A_), there emerge in\r\nJuly the slender, delicately formed male and female gall-wasps which\r\nwere long known as _Trigonaspis crustalis_. Both males and females\r\nare winged, and fly rapidly about in the air (Fig. 124, _B_ and _C_).\r\nThe sexes pair, and the females lay their eggs in the cell-layers\r\non the under side of an oak-leaf, on which arise small, wart-like,\r\nkidney-shaped galls (Fig. 125, _B_) which fall to the ground in autumn,\r\nand from which there emerge, in the middle of winter, the plump,\r\nwingless females, to which, as we have already seen, the name _Biorhiza\r\nrenum_ was given.\r\n\r\nOne generation, therefore, lays its eggs in the parenchyma of tender\r\nleaves, and has only to pierce through a thin layer of plant-tissue,\r\nwhile the other must penetrate deep down into the hard winter bud,\r\nto be able to deposit its eggs in the proper place, and we therefore\r\nfind that in the two kinds of female the ovipositor differs in length,\r\nthickness, and general structure, and so also does the whole complex\r\napparatus by which the ovipositor is moved. But these differences are\r\nassociated with the form of the abdomen, in which the ovipositor lies,\r\nand with the strength and shape of the legs, which must be shorter\r\nand stronger when the boring has to be performed through a hard\r\nplant-tissue or to a considerable depth. We can readily understand how\r\nnumerous must be the secondary variations which a transformation of the\r\novipositor brings in its train when we compare the ovipositor apparatus\r\nin the two generations of one of these species (Fig. 126).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126. Ovipositor and ovum of the two generations\r\nof the same species of Gall-wasp. _A_, those of the winter form,\r\n_Neuroterus læviusculus_. _B_, those of the summer-form, _Spathegaster\r\nalbipes_. _st_, ovipositor. _ei_, ovum. Similarly magnified. After\r\nAdler.]\r\n\r\nFigure 126 shows the ovipositor of another gall-wasp, of which the\r\nwinter form, _Neuroterus læviusculus_, also perforates the hard winter\r\nbuds of the oak, while the summer form, _Spathegaster albipes_, lays\r\nits eggs in the tender young leaves of the same tree. The ovipositor of\r\nthe former is thin and long, that of the latter short and strong (Fig.\r\n126, _A_ and _B_), and corresponding also to the depth at which the egg\r\nmust be sunk, or, so to speak, sown in the tissue of the plant, the egg\r\nof the summer generation differs from that of the winter generation\r\nby having a much shorter stalk (Fig. 126, _ei_). These little wasps\r\nthus afford a beautiful example of the way in which even marked\r\nchanges in the conditions of life of a generation may be associated\r\nwith transformations in bodily structure, and we understand how it\r\nwas possible that by means of processes of selection the generations\r\nwhich alternate periodically in the year should come to diverge very\r\nconsiderably in structure. The example may also serve to illustrate how\r\ndiverse are the harmonious co-adaptations which such transformations\r\nrequire, and how necessary, therefore, the continual re-combination of\r\nthe ids of the germ-plasm by means of amphimixis must be. We understand\r\nwhy bi-sexual reproduction was only abandoned in one generation, and\r\nthat the one in which parthenogenesis was of considerable advantage.\r\nBut such transformations must have come about with extreme slowness,\r\nsince they were the result of climatic changes which only come about\r\nvery gradually. We thus come again to the same conclusion to which\r\nwe were led by our study of vestigial organs in Man, that numerous\r\nspecies which appear to be at a standstill are continually working\r\ntowards their own improvement. But for this amphimixis is essential;\r\nconsequently the descendants which have arisen through amphimixis, and\r\nwhose ancestors have arisen in the same way, have an advantage over\r\nthose of parthenogenetic origin. On the whole, at least, this must be\r\nso; in special cases it may be otherwise, namely, when the advantage\r\noffered by parthenogenesis in respect to the maintenance of the species\r\npreponderates over the advantage which amphimixis implies as regards\r\npossibilities of transformation.\r\n\r\nAs far as we have seen from the case of the gall-wasps, the absence of\r\namphimixis in every second generation implies no disadvantage in regard\r\nto the capability for transformation which the species exhibits. As to\r\nwhether any disadvantage would ensue if the number of parthenogenetic\r\ngenerations in the life-cycle were greater we can only guess, since no\r\ncase is known which enables us to decide this point, _pro_ or _con_,\r\nwith any certainty. The heterogony of the plant-lice, the Aphides, and\r\ntheir relatives might be cited as against the probability, for in this\r\ncase a long series of parthenogenetic generations often alternates\r\nwith a single bi-sexual one, but the difference in structure is not so\r\ngreat in this case, although it does exist, and moreover we can quite\r\nwell assume that the adaptation to parthenogenesis was effected at the\r\nbeginning of heterogony, when it still consisted of a cycle of only\r\ntwo generations, and that further virgin generations were interpolated\r\nsubsequently.\r\n\r\nThis assumption is supported by the fact that in some species of our\r\nindigenous Ostracods, in _Cypris vidua_ and _Candona candens_, in\r\ncontrast to the Daphnids, several bi-sexual generations alternate\r\nwith one parthenogenetic generation. But in this case again there is\r\nno difference whatever in the structure of the two generations, the\r\nparthenogenetic generation being distinguished from the bi-sexual\r\ngeneration simply by the absence of males.\r\n\r\nThe alternation of generations in the plant-lice is particularly\r\ninstructive, because it emphatically indicates how much Nature is\r\nconcerned with the retention of amphimixis, and how little mere\r\nmultiplication has to do with this. This is especially striking in the\r\ncase of the bark-lice; for instance, in their notorious representative,\r\nthe vine-pest, _Phylloxera vastatrix_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127. Life-cycle of the Vine-pest (_Phylloxera\r\nvastatrix_), after Leuckart and Nitsche, and Ritter and Rübsamen. _A_,\r\nthe fertilized ovum. _B_, the resulting apterous and parthenogenetic\r\nPhylloxera. _C_, its eggs, from which, as the uppermost arrow\r\nindicates, there may arise similar apterous, parthenogenetic forms, or,\r\nas the horizontal arrow indicates, winged forms (_D_), which produce\r\n'female' and 'male' ova (_E^1_ and _E^2_); from these the sexual\r\ngeneration arises, the female (_F^1_) and the male (_F^2_); the former\r\nlays the fertilized ovum (_A_).]\r\n\r\nAs in all plant-lice, the advantage for the sake of which sexual\r\nreproduction was given up depends upon the fact that a practically\r\nunlimited food supply is at the disposal of these parasites of the\r\nvine, which can be made full use of during the proper season, and\r\nwhich, since every animal is female and produces eggs, results in an\r\nenormous increase in the number of individuals, and thus secures the\r\ncontinuance of the species. These insects emerge in spring from small\r\nfertilized eggs, which have lain dormant throughout the winter (Fig.\r\n127, _A_), and they develop rapidly into wingless females (_B_), which,\r\nsucking the juice of the vine, multiply by producing large numbers\r\nof little white eggs (_C_). These develop without fertilization into\r\nsimilar wingless females. Several generations of females succeed each\r\nother, but then, usually from August onwards, differently formed winged\r\nfemales (_D_) make their appearance, and these, flying from plant to\r\nplant, effect the distribution of the species. But these, too, lay\r\nparthenogenetic eggs (_E^1_ and _E^2_), and from these there emerge,\r\nlate in autumn, the members of the single bi-sexual generation, males\r\nand females (_F^1_ and _F^2_), both very minute and wingless, without\r\na piercing proboscis, and thus incapable of taking food. These pair,\r\nand the female lays a single egg (_A_) under the bark of the vine,\r\nfrom which the leaves are now falling; this egg survives the winter,\r\nand from it in the following April or May there emerges once more a\r\nparthenogenetic female.\r\n\r\nIt could hardly be more plainly shown than it is by this case that the\r\nimportance of amphimixis is something quite apart from reproduction\r\nand multiplication, for here the number of individuals is not only not\r\nincreased by amphimixis, but is materially diminished, being indeed\r\nlessened by a half. By the retention of amphimixis, the species gains\r\nin this case no advantage _except_ the mingling of two germ-plasms.\r\n\r\nSomething similar occurs in plants which exhibit alternation of\r\ngenerations, for instance the ferns, in which the sexual generation,\r\nthe so-called prothallium or prothallus, contributes nothing to\r\nthe _multiplication_ of the plant, since only a single egg-cell\r\nis developed; and the same is true of the mosses. In both cases\r\n_multiplication_ depends solely on the asexual generation, which, as\r\nthe so-called 'moss-fruit' or 'fern-plant proper,' produces an enormous\r\nnumber of spores, in addition to multiplying by runners.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: we have seen that self-fertilization does occur in\r\nhermaphrodite animals, where otherwise the species would be in\r\ndanger of extinction, but this is never the _sole_ and exclusive\r\nmode of fertilization[25], for hermaphrodite species have always the\r\npossibility of securing inter-crossing of individuals, and that in\r\nvarious ways, whether by the intervention of 'primordial males' or\r\nby an occasional or a periodic alternation of self-fertilization and\r\nmutual fertilization. Pure parthenogenesis enduring through innumerable\r\ngenerations does appear to occur, but in most cases unisexual\r\ngenerations alternate with bi-sexual, so that a stereotyping of the\r\ngerm-plasm with complete uniformity of ids is obviated.\r\n\r\n[25] As to the cases Maupas has brought into notice, of permanent and\r\napparently exclusive self-fertilization in Rhabditidæ (round worms),\r\nit seems fair to say that they have not been as yet sufficiently\r\ninvestigated to admit of a secure appreciation of their value in their\r\ntheoretical bearings. Cf. _Arch. Zool. Exper._, 3rd ser., vol. viii,\r\n1900.\r\n\r\nWe must now briefly consider the higher plants with reference to the\r\nmaintenance of diversity in the germ-plasm through crossing.\r\n\r\nWe saw in an earlier lecture that most flowers are hermaphrodite,\r\nbut that they do not fertilize themselves, and are adapted for\r\ncrossing, since the pollen of one flower is carried by insects to\r\nthe pistil of another, which cannot be reached by its own pollen,\r\neither because it ripens too early or too late, or because the\r\nstigma, notwithstanding its proximity, is so placed as to be out of\r\nreach of the pollen from the adjacent stamens. I showed, following\r\nthe fundamental investigations of Sprengel, Charles Darwin, Hermann\r\nMüller, and other successors of Darwin, that the flowers may in a sense\r\nbe regarded as the resultants of the insect-visits, since all their\r\naccessory adaptations--large coloured petals, fragrance, nectar, and\r\neven little minutiæ of colour and markings (honey-guides)--as well\r\nas their detailed shape, as seen in 'landing stages,' corolla tubes,\r\nand so on, are only intelligible when we refer their existence to\r\nnatural selection. We assume that each of these adaptations secured\r\nsome advantage for the species concerned, and that therefore their\r\nfirst beginnings as slight germinal varieties were accepted, and were\r\nbrought gradually to their full expression by the united operation\r\nof germinal and personal selection. This at least is how we should\r\nexpress ourselves now that we have become acquainted with the factor\r\nof germinal selection. The advantage secured by every such improvement\r\nin a flower's means of attracting insects is obvious, as soon as it\r\nis established that cross-fertilization is more advantageous for the\r\nspecies than self-fertilization.\r\n\r\nWe have discussed this already; we saw that experiments instituted\r\nby Darwin proved that seedlings which had arisen through\r\ncross-fertilization were superior to those arising through\r\nself-fertilization, and that in many cases the mother-plant itself\r\nproduced fewer seeds when self-fertilized than when cross-fertilized.\r\nThis discovery afforded an explanation of the cross-fertilization\r\nof flowers by insects which Sprengel had previously observed. We\r\nunderstand how the flowers must have become so adapted through\r\nprocesses of selection that they were unable to fertilize themselves,\r\nbut attracted insects, and, so to speak, compelled these to dust them\r\nwith pollen from another plant of the same species. We also understand\r\nhow self-fertilization remained possible for many flowers in the\r\nevent of cross-fertilization through insects not being effected,\r\nsince after a certain period of waiting, a curvature of the stamens\r\nor the pistil may take place and lead to the stigma being dusted with\r\nthe pollen of the same flower. Obviously the development of _fewer_\r\nseeds is preferable to complete sterility. It is a well-known fact\r\nthat peculiar inconspicuous and closed flowers, designed solely for\r\nself-fertilization, may occur along with the open flowers, as in the\r\ncase of the so-called cleistogamous flowers of the violet (_Viola_)\r\nand the little dead-nettle (_Lamium amplexicaule_), and the phyletic\r\norigin of these becomes intelligible as soon as it is established that\r\ncross-fertilization is more advantageous than self-fertilization.\r\n\r\nNow, however, it seems as if the fundamental proposition of this theory\r\nof flowers will have to be rejected. Not only do the cleistogamous\r\nflowers just mentioned exhibit a great fertility, not at all less\r\nthan that of the open flowers of the same species which are adapted\r\nfor cross-fertilization, but there is a small number of plants which\r\nproduce seeds by _self-fertilization alone_. Thus in _Myrmecodia_\r\ncross-fertilization is absolutely prevented by the fact that the\r\nflowers never open, and according to Charles Darwin _Ophrys apifera_\r\nalso reproduces by self-fertilization alone, and is nevertheless a\r\nthoroughly vigorous plant. There are several other cases of this sort,\r\nand particularly among the orchids, though the whole of the structure\r\nof their flowers is specially adapted for pollination by insects.\r\nMany of them are only rarely visited by insects, some not at all, we\r\nknow not why, but it is readily intelligible that in such cases they\r\nshould have adapted themselves to self-fertilization wherever that was\r\npossible. For this _no great_ variation was necessary; it was enough\r\nthat the pollinia, which formerly only became detached from their\r\nattachment at a touch or a push from an insect, should free themselves\r\nspontaneously. And this, according to Darwin, is what happens,\r\nfor instance, in _Ophrys scolopax_, which at Cannes is frequently\r\nself-fertilizing. For the development of seed, however, it is not\r\nenough that the pollen should reach the stigma; the pollen-grain has\r\nto send out its tube and penetrate into the ovary, and in many orchids\r\nthis does not happen; they are infertile with their own pollen. Various\r\nother plants are also non-fertile with their own pollen, for instance\r\nthe common corydalis, _Corydalis cava_, or the meadow cuckoo-flower,\r\n_Cardamine pratensis_ (Hildebrand).\r\n\r\nHow are we to reconcile these apparently absolutely contradictory\r\nfacts? On the one hand, the innumerable devices for securing crossing\r\nlead us to conclude that it is necessary, or at least advantageous,\r\nand on the other we find a small number of plants which reproduce\r\ncontinually by self-fertilization and yet remain strong and vigorous.\r\nAnd again there are many plants which yield seed when fertilized with\r\ntheir own pollen, and others which remain absolutely sterile in the\r\nsame circumstances, yielding no seed or very little, and there is\r\nindeed one on which its own pollen has the effect of a poison, for if\r\nit reaches the stigma the flower dies. If there is anything injurious\r\nin self-fertilization (Darwin), we can understand that it will be\r\navoided, but how can it be continued so long in many cases, and even\r\nbecome in others the exclusive method of fertilization without visible\r\nevil results?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in these facts, established by observation, the\r\nresults of two quite different processes have been confused, and that\r\nwe can only gain clearness by studying them apart from one another; I\r\nmean the processes involved in the mechanism of fertilization and those\r\ninvolved in the mingling of the germ-plasms.\r\n\r\nIn many cases self-fertilization is said to yield less seed and weaker\r\nseedlings. Let us for the present take this statement as the basis of\r\nour consideration; it does not seem to me conceivable, though here I\r\nam not in agreement with views that have been expressed by others,\r\nthat both effects should depend upon the same causes, for the smaller\r\nnumber of seeds cannot possibly depend upon the mingling of the two\r\nparental germ-plasms, and thus not upon the process of amphimixis\r\nitself, since the effect of the mingling does not make itself felt\r\nuntil the organism of the offspring is being built up. Of course the\r\nplant seed is the embryo of the young plant, but it will hardly be\r\nthought probable that its development could be absolutely prevented\r\nby the too close relationship of the two germ-cells, and thus the\r\nnumber of the developing seeds cannot depend on the quality of the ids\r\nco-operating in the segmentation-nucleus, but presumably on the number\r\nof ova awaiting fertilization in the ovary, which are reached by a\r\npollen-tube and then by a paternal sex-nucleus. This again will depend\r\nupon the impelling and attracting forces of the pollen-grain on the one\r\nhand, and of the stigma and 'embryo-sac' of the flower on the other. In\r\nother words, the fertility of a flower with its own pollen will depend\r\nupon whether the two products of the flower are adapted for mutual\r\nco-operation, and in what degree they are so. We are here dealing not\r\nwith the _primary_ reactions of the germ-plasms, which are as they are\r\nand cannot be varied, but with secondary relations, which may be thus\r\nor thus--in short, with _adaptations_.\r\n\r\nBy what adaptations the pollen of a flower can be made ineffective\r\nfor that flower is a question which we must leave the botanists to\r\nanswer; in any case it must have been possible, and we see clearly\r\nthat it depends upon adaptation when we consider the numerous stages\r\nwhich occur--from the rare case of the actually poisonous influence\r\nof self-pollination already noticed, to complete sterility, and from\r\nlessened fertility to greater or even perfect fertility. It is possible\r\nthat chemical products, secretions of the stigma or the pollen-grain,\r\nor the so-called synergid-cells, have to do with this, or that the\r\nsize and therewith the penetrating power of the pollen-cell in\r\nself-fertilization stand in inverse ratio to the length of the pistil,\r\nas has been proved in regard to heterostylism by Strasburger; but in\r\nany case it was possible for Nature, by means of slight variations in\r\nthe characters of the male and female parts of the flower, to diminish\r\nthe certainty of the meeting of the two germ-cells, even to the total\r\nexclusion of the possibility of any union of these.\r\n\r\nIf, then, self-fertilization had to be guarded against or at least\r\nrendered difficult because its consequences were injurious, all\r\nvariations pointing in the direction of safeguarding would necessarily\r\nbe preserved and increased. In many cases variations in the structure\r\nof the flower were sufficient; but when, as in _Corydalis cava_, the\r\npollen could not readily be prevented from falling upon the stigma, the\r\npollen might be made sterile as far as its own flower was concerned\r\nby a process of selection, in which on an average those plants would\r\nremain successful which produced the largest number of cross-fertilized\r\nseeds, and in this case those which did so were those whose pollen\r\nreacted most feebly to the stimulus of their own stigma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128. Heterostylism (_Primula sinensis_), after\r\nNoll. Two heterostylic flowers from different plants. _L_, the\r\nlong-styled form. _K_, the short-styled form. _G_, style. _S_, anthers.\r\n_P_, _p_, pollen-grains. _N_, _n_, stigmatic papillæ of the long-styled\r\nand short-styled forms respectively. _P_, _p_, _N_, _n_, magnified 110\r\ntimes.]\r\n\r\nThat self-sterility in all these different degrees is not a primary\r\ncharacter of the species, but an adaptation to the advantages of\r\ncross-fertilization, is apparent--if indeed it seems doubtful to any\r\none--especially from cases of heterostylism. I refer to the dimorphism\r\nand trimorphism which Darwin discovered in many flowers, and which\r\nshows itself in the fact that flowers otherwise almost exactly\r\nalike, as, for instance, primroses, may exhibit a long style in some\r\nindividuals, and in others a short one (Fig. 128). At the same time,\r\nthere is a difference in the position of the stamens, which are placed\r\nhigher up in flowers with short styles, and much lower down in those\r\nwith long styles. Experiments have proved that the dusting of the\r\nstigma has the best results if pollen from the short-styled reaches\r\nthe stigma of the long-styled form, or if pollen from the long-styled\r\nform reaches the stigma of the short-styled. Thus we have again to deal\r\nwith an arrangement for crossing, an adaptation to the advantages of\r\ncross-fertilization, and we can in this case see the reason why the\r\npollen has a different effect upon the two stigmas; the pollen-grains\r\nof the flowers with short style are larger than those of the flowers\r\nwith long style, and as the length of the pollen-tube that can be sent\r\nout must depend upon the mass of protoplasm within the pollen-grain,\r\nit follows that the smaller pollen-grains will send out too short a\r\ntube to reach through the long style to the embryo-sac. In addition to\r\nthis there is a difference in the papillæ of the stigmas, and it is\r\npossible that these may form an obstacle to the penetrating of pollen\r\nfrom a similar type. The process of selection which gives rise to such\r\narrangements as we find in Primulas may easily be imagined, as soon as\r\nwe are able to assume that cross-fertilization is more advantageous\r\nthan self-fertilization as regards progeny, that is, as regards the\r\ncontinuance of the species.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that uninterrupted self-fertilization is unknown\r\namong animals, but that it is not even very rare among plants, and\r\nthis emphatically corroborates our previous conclusion, that the\r\nreason for which amphimixis was introduced as a normal event in nature\r\nis not to be sought for in the necessity for a renewing of life, or\r\n'rejuvenation.' It cannot be a necessity, but only an advantage, which\r\ncan in certain circumstances be dispensed with.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is obvious enough that continued inbreeding in its\r\nmost extreme form, self-fertilization, does not imply an absolute\r\nabandonment of amphimixis, the adherents of the rejuvenescence theory\r\nhave regarded the unfavourable consequences of pure inbreeding as a\r\nconfirmation of their assumption, according to which amphimixis is\r\nindispensable to the continuance of the life of the species, and it\r\nis therefore an important fact, if it can be proved, that continued\r\nself-fertilization can occur persistently, among plants at least, and\r\nyet not cause any injurious results to the species.\r\n\r\nBut how can this fact be understood from our point of view? How does it\r\nhappen that crossing is striven after in so many different ways and yet\r\nso often given up again, and continued self-fertilization resorted to?\r\n\r\nTo this it may be answered, in the first place, that it is not,\r\nas far as we can see, for _internal_ reasons that persistent\r\nself-fertilization becomes the rule; there is no peculiar condition\r\nof the germ-plasm which makes it disadvantageous or superfluous\r\nthat the diversity of the id-combinations should be maintained;\r\nself-fertilization is due to _external_ influences which bring it about\r\nthat the plant has only the alternative of producing no seeds at all\r\nor of producing them by self-fertilization. In this connexion Darwin's\r\nexperiments with orchids are particularly noteworthy.\r\n\r\nIn this very diversified order of plants there are numerous species\r\nwhose flowers are infertile with their own pollen, although it\r\ndoes not reach the stigma in natural conditions, and therefore\r\nthere was no necessity--as far as we can see--for guarding against\r\nself-fertilization by 'self-sterility.' These flowers are thus doubly\r\nadapted, so to speak, for crossing by means of insects. But as regards\r\nmany of these, as well as many other modern orchids, insect-visits are\r\nvery rare, and in some cases do not occur at all, and therefore these\r\nspecies cannot produce seed or can do so only exceptionally.\r\n\r\nThis is true of most of the Epidendra of South America, and of\r\n_Coryanthus triloba_ of New Zealand, two hundred blossoms of which only\r\nyielded five seed-capsules, and also of our _Ophrys muscifera_ and _O.\r\naranifera_, the latter of which yielded only a single seed-capsule\r\nfrom 3,000 flowers gathered in Liguria. We might expect that the\r\nspecies in question must have become very rare, but this is not always\r\nthe case, since each of these capsules contains an enormous number\r\nof seeds, sometimes many thousands. As soon as the visits of insects\r\ncease altogether, the species must die out in the particular locality\r\nconcerned, unless it can revert to self-pollination and self-fertility.\r\nThere is a whole series of species in which the stigma of the flower\r\nis sensitive to its own pollen, and in many of these an adaptation\r\nto self-fertilization has actually been effected, for the pollinia\r\ndetach themselves from their anthers at maturity and fall upon the\r\nstigma. I have already mentioned _Ophrys apifera_, which, according to\r\nCharles Darwin, is no longer visited by insects, although its flowers\r\nstill possess the structure required for insect-fertilization. This\r\nspecies has saved itself from extinction by the normal occurrence of\r\nself-fertilization.\r\n\r\nThis seems to me noteworthy in two respects. In the first place, it\r\nshows that pure self-fertilization need not necessarily result in a\r\nweakening of the species, and secondly, it affords a clear instance\r\nof a species being transformed in one minute character only, all the\r\nother characters remaining unaltered. In this case it was only the\r\npollinia that required to vary a little in their mode of attachment and\r\nmaturation, in order to effect the transformation of the flower for\r\nself-fertilization, and in point of fact that is all that has varied.\r\nThe case is not relevant to our investigation at this moment, but\r\ncases of the kind can so rarely be clearly demonstrated that I cannot\r\nlose the opportunity of calling attention to it. The germ-plasm of\r\nthis _Ophrys_ must have varied at an earlier stage, for otherwise the\r\ndetachment of the pollinia would not have become normal and hereditary,\r\nbut it can only have varied to the extent that the structure of this\r\none small part of the flower was affected by the variation; something\r\nmust have varied in the germ-plasm that had no influence upon the other\r\nparts of the flower, that is, solely the _determinants_ of the pollinia.\r\n\r\nLet us return after this digression to our previous train of thought;\r\nwe have to inquire how we can interpret the fact of continued\r\nself-fertilization without any visible injurious results to the\r\nspecies. If cross-fertilization be a material advantage as regards the\r\ncontinuance of the species, how can it be transformed into its opposite\r\nwithout evil effects? And there are no visible evil effects in _Ophrys\r\napifera_. It is indeed not so abundant as _Ophrys muscifera_, or other\r\nallied species, but it certainly does not follow from that that it is\r\non the way to extinction; certainly no decrease either of vigour of\r\ngrowth or of fertility can be observed.\r\n\r\nIf we inquire from the standpoint of our theory, how the composition\r\nof the germ-plasm must have altered through continual inbreeding,\r\nwe have already found the answer--that through the reduction of the\r\nnumber of ids at the maturation of every germ-cell the diversity of the\r\ngerm-plasm would gradually be lessened, that the number of different\r\nids would thereby be lessened possibly even to the identity of the\r\nwhole of the ids.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of such extreme uniformity of the germ-plasm would\r\nnot, according to our theory, necessarily be that the species would\r\nbe incapable of continued existence, but it would be that the species\r\nwould become incapable of adaptations in many directions. Adaptations\r\nin one direction, such, for instance, as the variation in the mode of\r\nattachment and detachment of the pollinia of an Orchid, would still be\r\npossible. Thus a species which has long been perfectly adapted will be\r\nable to make the transition to inbreeding without injury to its chances\r\nof continued existence, if it be compelled by circumstances to do so.\r\nSpecies, on the other hand, which are still undergoing considerable\r\ntransformations in many directions must be exposed by these to the\r\ndanger of degeneration, just as happens in the artificial experiments\r\nwith domesticated animals, whose secret weaknesses are greatly\r\nexaggerated by inbreeding.\r\n\r\nWe might be inclined to regard the effects of inbreeding as similar to\r\nthose of parthenogenesis; they are certainly analogous, for both modes\r\nof reproduction must lead to a certain degree of uniformity in the\r\ngerm-plasm. But there seems to me to be a difference and one which is\r\nnot without importance.\r\n\r\nIn parthenogenesis no amphimixis occurs, but neither does any reduction\r\nof the number of the ids to one-half; all the ids present at the\r\nbeginning of parthenogenesis are retained; they are only no longer\r\nmingled with strange ids. In inbreeding both amphimixis and reduction\r\ntake place, but the former soon ceases to convey any really strange\r\nids to the germ-plasm, but only the same as those which it already\r\ncontains, so that a rapidly increasing monotony of the germ-plasm\r\nmust result. To this must be added the possibility that among the\r\nfew ids which now--many times repeated--form the germ-plasm, some\r\nmust occur which exhibit unfavourable variational tendencies in\r\none or many determinants, and then the same thing will occur which\r\nusually occurs in experimental inbreeding of domesticated animals,\r\nnamely, _degeneration of the progeny_. In parthenogenesis the case is\r\notherwise; unfavourable variational tendencies, as soon as they attain\r\nselection-value, are, so to speak, eliminated root and branch, because\r\nthe individuals which exhibit them, and their whole lineage, are\r\nexterminated, without their having any effect upon the other collateral\r\nlines of descent. A purely parthenogenetic species will, therefore, not\r\ndegenerate as long as individuals of normal constitution are present,\r\nfor these reproduce with perfect purity. But if in later generations\r\nunfavourable variational tendencies crop up in the germ-plasm through\r\ngerminal selection, the process of personal selection will be\r\nreinforced on these or on their descendants, and it is conceivable, and\r\neven probable, that in perfectly adapted species parthenogenesis may\r\nlast for a very long time without doing any injury to the constitution\r\nof the species.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of purely asexual reproduction, to the investigation\r\nof which we shall now turn.\r\n\r\nLet us leave out of account the simplest animals (Monera) without\r\namphimixis, which we have already discussed. In simple animals\r\nreproduction by budding or by fission is frequent, or it occurs in\r\nalternation with sexual reproduction; in higher animals, Arthropods,\r\nMollusca, and Vertebrates, asexual reproduction is wholly absent.\r\nIn plants it plays an enormously greater part, and what is called\r\n'vegetative reproduction,' which is purely asexual without any\r\namphimixis, is to be found in all groups of plants, especially in\r\nthe form of budding and spore-formation, besides which there is\r\nmultiplication by runners, rhizomes, tubers, bulbs, and bulbils. In\r\nmost cases there is, in addition to the purely asexual reproduction,\r\nso-called sexual reproduction associated with amphimixis, and often\r\nthe sexual and asexual generations alternate with each other, so that\r\n'alternation of generations' occurs, as is common in lower animals,\r\nespecially polyps, medusæ, and worms.\r\n\r\nBut it sometimes happens among plants that the sexual reproduction is\r\nabsent, and that a species reproduces by the asexual mode only, and\r\nthis is the case which we must now consider more closely.\r\n\r\nLet us first of all seek to gain clearness as to the composition of\r\nthe germ-plasm in the case of purely asexual multiplication, and what\r\nconclusions may be drawn from this, and then let us compare these\r\nwith the known observational data, and it will be apparent that in\r\nindividuals which have arisen by budding the complete germ-plasm\r\nof the species must be contained; the number of ids will not only\r\nremain the same in the bud as it was in the mother plant, but the\r\nnumber of _different ids_ will not be diminished. The case is\r\nanalogous to that of pure parthenogenesis, in which the absence of\r\nthe second maturation-division of the ovum allows the germ-plasm to\r\nretain the full complement of ids. Charles Darwin held that purely\r\nasexual multiplication was 'closely analogous to long-continued\r\nself-fertilization,' yet, as we have seen, according to our theory\r\nthere must be a not inconsiderable difference between the two\r\nprocesses, depending on the fact that in exclusive self-fertilization\r\nthe number of different ids is continually decreasing, while in purely\r\nasexual reproduction the germ-plasm loses nothing of the diversity of\r\nits ids. If, therefore, the germ-plasm in purely asexual reproduction\r\nno longer receives fresh ids through amphimixis, it at least loses none\r\nof those it formerly possessed. Although we cannot consider it adapted\r\nfor entering upon new adaptations in many directions, yet we may expect\r\nthat the species will continue to reproduce unchanged for longer\r\nthan in the case of exclusive self-fertilization, the more so since\r\nall unfavourable variational tendencies which crop up are eliminated\r\nas soon as they attain to selection-value, and, as in the case of\r\nparthenogenesis, they are eliminated without being mingled with other\r\nlines of descent.\r\n\r\nLet us take, for instance, the purely asexual reproduction which\r\nobtains in Algæ of the genus _Laminaria_, in regard to which it is\r\nstated that it multiplies only through asexual swarm-spores. There\r\nare quite a number of species of this large tangle, and if it should\r\nbe established that in all these the spore-cells really do not\r\nconjugate, then the case would prove that the species of a genus can\r\nmaintain a well-defined existence for a long time after amphimixis has\r\nbeen given up. But this would not be a proof of the possibility of\r\n_species-formation_, for that the ancestral forms of the Laminarians\r\nmust have possessed amphigony may be assumed, since their nearest\r\nrelatives exhibit it still. It cannot be proved, but there seems\r\nnothing against the assumption that these tangles have existed for a\r\nlong time under uniform conditions, and have become adapted to these\r\nwith a high degree of constancy.\r\n\r\nThe conditions are similar in the marine Algæ of the genus _Caulerpa_,\r\nthe nearest relatives of which reproduce sexually, though they\r\nthemselves, as far as is known, reproduce only by spores.\r\n\r\nIn the Lichens, which represent, as we have already seen, a\r\nlife-partnership between Fungi and Algæ, amphimixis appears not to\r\noccur at all; the unicellular Alga reproduces by cell-division, the\r\nFungus by producing a great number of swarm-spores, which do not\r\nconjugate with one another. As far as the Alga is concerned we might\r\nperhaps suppose that the simplicity of its structure makes it possible\r\nfor it to dispense with a constant recombination of its few characters\r\nto bring about the most favourable composition in its idioplasm; in\r\nsupport of this we may note that even the life-long combination with\r\nthe Fungus has caused no visible variation in the Alga, as we must\r\nconclude from the fact that these Algæ can also live independently, and\r\nthat the same species of Alga may combine with several different Fungi\r\nto form different species of lichen, just as the same Fungus may also\r\nform part of several species of lichen. We might also imagine that we\r\nhave here no more than a direct influence of the Alga and Fungus upon\r\none another, and that there is no adaptation to the new conditions of\r\nlife at all, yet that can hardly be seriously maintained in regard to\r\nspecies which live under such definite and diverse conditions. It now\r\nseems to be established--contrary to the older statements--that the\r\nlichen-fungus only reproduces asexually, and in face of this it seems\r\nto me that nothing remains except to make the assumption that lichens\r\nformerly possessed sexual reproduction, but that they have lost it,\r\nthough whether all have done so is, perhaps, not yet quite certain.\r\n\r\nThe same assumption must be made in regard to the Basidiomycetes among\r\nthe Fungi, and for most of the Ascomycetes, for in these groups of\r\nFungi sexual reproduction has only been demonstrated 'with certainty in\r\na few genera.' That in these cases also there has been a degeneration\r\nof amphigony, until it has completely disappeared, seems probable from\r\nthe two other groups of Fungi, the Zygomycetes and Oomycetes, since in\r\nthese 'a reduction of sexuality amounting in some cases to complete\r\ndisappearance' can be demonstrated even in existing forms. But whether\r\nit may be assumed that the Fungi which are now asexual are no longer\r\ncapable of new adaptations, and whether their parasitic habit may be\r\nregarded as making up in some way for the lack of the remingling of\r\nthe germ-plasm, as the botanist Möbius supposes, I am not able to\r\ndecide. It is obvious that data in regard to amphimixis among the Fungi\r\nare still incomplete, and recent investigations lead us to suspect\r\nthat sexual mingling may not be absent, but only disguised. Dangeard,\r\nHarold Wager, and others have observed that a fusion of nuclei precedes\r\nthe formation of spores, and this may be regarded as amphimixis,\r\nalthough the conjugating nuclei belong to cells of the same plant and\r\nsometimes even to the same cell. But although we are here dealing\r\nwith a set of facts which cannot yet be satisfactorily formulated in\r\nterms of our theory, it is nevertheless not contradictory to it that\r\namphimixis should be wholly absent in the higher Fungi. But the fact\r\nwould be contradictory to the unadulterated rejuvenescence-theory, for\r\nif amphimixis were really a condition of the continuance of life, no\r\nspecies--as we have already said--could continue to exist without it\r\nfor countless generations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38 (repeated). A fragment of a Lichen (_Ephebe\r\nkerneri_), magnified 450 times. _a_, the green alga-cells. _P_, the\r\nfungoid filaments. After Kerner.]\r\n\r\nThe same argument holds true for the higher plants, which have become\r\npurely asexual under the influence of cultivation. I refer to many\r\nof the well-marked varieties of our cultivated plants which multiply\r\nexclusively, or almost exclusively, by means of tubers and slips,\r\nas is the case with the potato, the manioc, the sugar-cane, the\r\narrowroot-plant (_Maranta arundinacea_), and others. All these facts\r\ncan easily be reconciled with our interpretation of the meaning of\r\namphimixis, although the attempt to range them as evidence against\r\nour theory has more than once been made. We have thus arrived at the\r\nconclusion that while many-sided adaptations, that is, variations\r\nwhich transform the plant in accordance with the indirect influences\r\nof new conditions of life, cannot be brought about without a\r\npersistent mingling of germ-plasms, simple modifications may readily\r\nappear although amphimixis is altogether absent. If a wild plant be\r\npermanently transferred to a well-manured culture-bed, it is probable\r\nthat certain changes will occur in it, either gradually or at once.\r\nBut these are not adaptations; they are, so to speak, direct reactions\r\nof the organism which do not even require selection to make them\r\nincrease, but depend upon the influencing of certain determinants of\r\nthe germ-plasm, and which, like all germinal variations, will follow\r\ntheir course steadily until a halt is called either by germinal or by\r\npersonal selection. When a given plant is exposed to these new and\r\nartificial conditions, the changes in question make their appearance\r\nsooner or later, and follow their course, and go on increasing as long\r\nas that is compatible with the harmony of the structure and functioning\r\nof the plant, this depending, as in all individual development, on the\r\nstruggle between the parts, that is to say, on histonal selection.\r\nOnly in this respect is the utility or injuriousness of the change of\r\nimportance, for personal selection, the struggle between individuals,\r\ndoes not affect plants which are under cultivation.\r\n\r\nThat such modifications may increase and may persist through many\r\ngenerations, even with asexual multiplication, depends upon the fact\r\nthat the budding cells contain germ-plasm, as well as the germ-cells,\r\nand if particular determinants of the germ-plasm in general are caused\r\nto vary by these new influences, the variation may be transmitted\r\nfrom bud to bud, from shoot to shoot, and so go on increasing as long\r\nas the new conditions persist, as well as in amphigonic (bisexual)\r\nreproduction, where they are transmitted from germ-cell to germ-cell.\r\nIt is not inconceivable that an individual adaptation, that is to\r\nsay a useful adjustment, might be effected in the course of asexual\r\nreproduction, although it is improbable that direct influences\r\nwould give rise to just those changes which would be useful under\r\nthe new conditions. But there are a number of cases which have been\r\ninterpreted in this way. In several of the cultivated plants named,\r\nthe reproductive organs have themselves degenerated, either only the\r\nmale, or only the female, or both at the same time; and some observers,\r\naccepting the hypothesis of an inheritance of functional modifications,\r\nhave regarded this as the direct result of disuse during the long\r\nperiod of asexual reproduction.\r\n\r\nLeaving out of account this erroneous presupposition, we may ask how\r\nasexual reproduction, such as that of the potato by tubers instead of\r\nby seed, which has gone on exclusively for several centuries, could\r\nexercise any influence upon the flowers and seed-forming of this\r\nspecies? In point of fact it has exercised none in most potatoes, for\r\nthe flowers and seeds are just as fertile now as they were when the\r\npotato was first discovered.\r\n\r\nWhether the pollen of a flower is utilized in one or other of its\r\nthousands of pollen-grains by reaching the stigma of another plant\r\nof the same species, or whether all the pollen-grains are uselessly\r\nscattered abroad, cannot possibly affect the flower so as to cause\r\ndegeneration; the theory of disuse cannot be applied in this case.\r\nWhat is true of the potato holds good also of the manioc (_Manihot\r\nutilissima_), but, on the other hand, many of the best varieties of\r\ncommon fruits--pears, figs, grapes, pine-apples, and bananas--are\r\nseedless. In _Maranta arundinacea_ 'the whole wonderful structure\r\nof the flower has persisted, but the pollen-grains, that is the\r\ngerm-cells, are wanting.' Whether this implies a permanent degeneration\r\nof the sexual organs, that is to say, one that is embodied in the\r\nprimary constituents of the species, or whether it is only the result\r\nof over-abundant nourishment, or of other causes in the circumstances\r\naffecting the particular plant, can only be decided by experiment.\r\nProbably both occur. The common ivy, for instance, does not now blossom\r\nin the northern parts of Sweden and Russia, but it does so still in\r\nthe southern provinces. If plants were brought to us from the most\r\nnortherly zone of distribution, they would in all probability flower\r\nand bear fruit with us, and in that case the absence of bloom in these\r\nplants must have been a direct effect of the cold climate. But it is\r\nquite conceivable that cultivated plants have in many cases become\r\nhereditarily infertile, when they are constantly propagated only by\r\nmeans of buds, layering, and so on, not however because of any direct\r\neffect of this mode of propagation, but through chance germinal\r\nvariations. For in regard to many of them man has lost all interest in\r\nthe flowers and fruit, as, for instance, in the case of the potato; in\r\nother cases he is even interested in procuring seedless fruits.\r\n\r\nIn the first case he will quite readily make use of plants with\r\nimperfect flowers for propagating, if they are otherwise fit and\r\nexhibit what he wants in other respects; in the second case, he will\r\ngive a preference to individuals with seedless fruits, and thus\r\nincrease and strengthen the tendency to degeneration of the seeds in\r\nthe race concerned.\r\n\r\nAll these cases are quite in harmony with our conception of amphimixis,\r\nwhich, now that we have investigated the facts throughout the animate\r\nkingdom, we may sum up in the following propositions. In the whole\r\norganic world, from unicellular organisms up to the highest plants\r\nand animals, amphimixis now means an augmentation of the organism's\r\npower of adaptation to the conditions of its life, since it is only\r\nthrough amphimixis that simultaneous harmonious adaptation of many\r\nparts becomes possible. It effects this by the mingling and constant\r\nrecombination of the germ-plasm ids of different individuals, and thus\r\ngives the selection-processes the chance of favouring advantageous\r\nvariational tendencies and eliminating those which are unfavourable,\r\nas well as of collecting and combining all the variations which are\r\nnecessary for the further evolution of the species. This indirect\r\ninfluence of amphimixis on the capacity of organisms for surviving\r\nand being transformed is the fundamental reason for its general\r\nintroduction and for its persistence through the whole known realm of\r\norganisms from unicellulars upwards.\r\n\r\nThe reason for its _first_ introduction among the lower forms of life\r\nmust have been a direct effect which had a favourable influence on the\r\nmetabolism, and this is so far coincident with the subsequent import of\r\namphimixis, inasmuch as it may be regarded not only as a heightening of\r\nthe power of adaptation, but as an immediate and direct increase and\r\nextension of the power of assimilation. In any case, amphimixis is not\r\nnecessary to the actual preservation of life itself, but it does bring\r\nabout a wealth and diversity of organic architecture which without it\r\nwould have been unattainable.\r\n\r\nIf amphimixis has been abandoned in the course of phylogeny by isolated\r\ngroups of organisms, this has happened because other advantages accrued\r\nto them in consequence, which gave them greater security in the\r\nstruggle for existence; but it must be admitted that they thereby lost\r\ntheir perfect power of adaptation, and that they have thus bartered\r\ntheir future for the temporary securing of their existence.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this variational influence, amphimixis has also played a\r\npart in the evolution of sharply defined organic types, especially of\r\nspecific types; but of this we shall have more to say later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCES OF ENVIRONMENT\r\n\r\n Different modes and grades of selection--Changes due to the influences\r\n of environment--Superfluity and lack of food--The horses and cattle\r\n of the Falkland Islands--Angora animals--Protection against cold\r\n in Arctic and marine mammals--Plant-galls--Nägeli's _Hieracium_\r\n experiments--Experiments with _Polyommatus phlæas_--Artificially\r\n produced _Vanessa_-aberrations--Vöchting's experiments on the\r\n influence of light in the production of flower-forms--Heliotropism\r\n and other tropisms--Primary and secondary reactions of\r\n organisms--Herbst's 'lithium larvæ'--Schmankewitsch's experiments\r\n with _Artemia_--Poulton's caterpillars with facultative colour\r\n adaptation--Colour-change in fishes, chamæleon, &c.--Actual scope of\r\n those influences which directly produce organic changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough a long series of lectures we have devoted our attention to\r\nthose phenomena which bear some relation to the processes of selection;\r\nwe have attempted to gain clearness in regard to the modes and stages\r\nof these, and we reached the result that all variations which have\r\ntaken place in organisms since the first appearance of living matter\r\nare directed by processes of selection, that is, their direction and\r\nduration are determined by these processes, although they may have\r\ntheir roots in external influences. But it is not to be supposed that\r\nthis guidance is due solely to that one kind of selection which,\r\nwith Darwin and Wallace, we designate 'natural selection'; on the\r\ncontrary, we must regard this as only one of the different modes of\r\nthe processes of selection, necessarily occurring between all living\r\nunits which are equivalent to one another, and which, therefore, must\r\nmaintain a continual struggle with one another for space and food. If\r\nthe expression 'natural selection' were not already so firmly fixed\r\nin its meaning, I should propose that it should be employed in the\r\nmost general sense for all the processes of selection collectively,\r\nbut we must keep to its original meaning and use it only for personal\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that processes of selection take place even between the\r\nelements of the germ-plasm in all organisms which possess a germ-plasm\r\nas distinguished from the mass of the body, and that through these\r\nprocesses there arise those hereditary individual variations which,\r\nunder some circumstances, form the basis of transformations in the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nObviously this may come about in a twofold manner: firstly, a\r\nvariation movement originating in the germ-plasm may go on increasing\r\ntill it attains to selection-value, and then 'personal selection' steps\r\nin, and seeks to make it the common property of the species. But it\r\nis obviously also conceivable that variational tendencies arising in\r\nthe germ-plasm may never attain to selection-value at all, and then\r\nin most cases they will only continue to exist through a longer or\r\nshorter series of generations as individual distinguishing characters,\r\nwithout being transmitted to a larger number of individuals or becoming\r\na constant character of the species. Their persistence will depend\r\nessentially on the chance of mingling with other individuals, and on\r\nthe halving of the germ-plasm which precedes sexual reproduction.\r\nSooner or later these individual peculiarities disappear again, as may\r\noften be observed in the case of abnormalities or morbid tendencies in\r\nman, in as far as these do not weaken vitality. In the latter case they\r\nattain selection-value, though only negatively.\r\n\r\nBut even quite indifferent germinal variations, which neither raise\r\nnor lower the individual's power of survival, may, under some\r\ncircumstances, increase and lead to permanent variations of all the\r\nindividuals of a species, and this happens when they are conditioned by\r\nexternal influences which affect all the individuals of a species, or\r\nof the particular colony concerned, and it is this kind of organismal\r\nchange which we shall now study for a little in detail.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary never-ceasing, always active germinal selection depends,\r\nwe must assume, upon intra-germinal fluctuations of nutrition, or\r\ninequalities in the nutritive stream which circulates within the\r\ngerm-plasm. The variations which it produces may, therefore, be\r\ndifferent in each individual, since these fluctuations are a matter\r\nof chance and may affect the determinants _A_ in one individual and\r\nthe determinants _B_, _C_, or _X_ in another, or alternating groups\r\nof these. Or it may be that the homologous determinants _A_ may vary\r\nin a plus direction in one individual, and in a minus direction in\r\nanother, while in a third they may remain unchanged, and although the\r\nsame direction of variation of a determinant _N_ may occur in many\r\nindividuals, it will certainly not do so in all, and still less will\r\nit occur in all along with the same combination of fluctuations in the\r\nrest of the determinants. It is only if this occurs that the variation\r\ncan become a specific character.\r\n\r\nWe might expect on _a priori_ grounds that not only the chance\r\nfluctuations of nutrition within the germ-plasm would cause its\r\nelements to vary in this or that direction, but that there would also\r\nbe influences of a more general kind, especially those of nutrition and\r\nclimate, which would in the first place affect the body as a whole, but\r\nwith it also the germ-plasm, and which would therefore bring about\r\nvariations, either in all or only in certain determinants. In this case\r\nall the individuals would vary in the same way, because all would be\r\nsimilarly affected by the same causes of change.\r\n\r\nThis is actually the case; it is indubitable that external influences,\r\nsuch as those emanating from the environment or media in which species\r\nlive, are able to cause direct variation of the germ-plasm, that is,\r\npermanent, because hereditary variations. We have already referred to\r\nthis process and called it 'induced germinal selection.'\r\n\r\nThat such influences of environment may bring about changes in\r\n_individual_ organisms is obvious enough; that, for instance, good\r\nnutrition makes the body strong and vigorous, that too abundant food\r\nmakes it fat and causes degeneration, that insufficient food lessens\r\nits stamina and vigour, are well-known facts. We have to inquire, on\r\nthe one hand, to what extent such influences are able to cause changes\r\nin the individual body in the course of a lifetime, and, on the other\r\nhand, more particularly, how far such changes or modifications of the\r\nsoma can call forth corresponding variations in the determinant system\r\nof the germ-cells, and whether and under what circumstances they may be\r\ntransmitted; for where this is not the case there can be no permanent\r\nhereditary variation of the whole species, and the variation will only\r\npersist as long as the conditions which gave rise to it endure, and\r\nwill disappear again with these.\r\n\r\nThe influence of nutrition as a cause of variation has often been\r\nover-estimated. The old statement which has gone the round of the\r\ntextbooks since the time of John Hunter, that the stomach of carnivores\r\nmay be transformed by vegetable diet into a herbivore stomach, is\r\nabsolutely unproved. Brandes at least, who not only subjected all the\r\nstatements in the literature on this point to a critical investigation,\r\nbut also instituted experiments of his own, regards the statement as\r\naltogether unfounded. All the 'cases' cited, in which the stomach of a\r\ngull or of an owl fed on grain became transformed into an organ with\r\nstronger muscles and covered with horny plates, depend, according to\r\nBrandes, upon inexact observation. There can therefore be no question\r\nof any inheritance of this fictitious stomach-transformation, and the\r\nidea that such a fundamental histological adaptation as the alleged\r\ntransformation of the stomach of the grain-eating bird should arise as\r\na direct effect of the food is wholly without foundation.\r\n\r\nBut it is quite otherwise with purely quantitative differences in\r\nnutrition. That meagre diet influences individuals unfavourably is\r\nindubitable, and we are certainly justified in considering whether\r\nthis may not have an effect on the germ-cells, and one which will\r\ncorrespond to the changes induced on the body, so that if the\r\npoor nutrition should last through many generations an hereditary\r\ndegeneration of the species would occur, which would not at once\r\ndisappear though the animals were transferred to more favourable\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nWe certainly know nothing of how far the minuteness of the determinants\r\nof the germ-plasm, the whole quantity of the germ-plasm, or the reduced\r\nsize of the germ-cell, may bear an internal relation to the smallness\r\nof the animal which develops therefrom, but it surely cannot be\r\nregarded as absurd to suppose that there is some such relation. There\r\nare no experiments known to me which prove that meagre diet brings\r\nabout a progressive decrease in the size of the body. Carl von Voit\r\nhas observed that dogs of the same litter grew to very different sizes\r\nof body according as they received abundant or scanty food, but it\r\nwould be difficult to make animals small through scantiness of food\r\nand at the same time to keep them capable of reproduction, and thus\r\nproofs of the inheritance of the dwarfing are lacking. Moreover, the\r\nexperiments which Nature herself has made are never quite convincing,\r\nbecause we never can definitely exclude the indirect effect of altered\r\ncircumstances. The case of the feral horses of the Falkland Islands, so\r\noften cited since the time of Darwin, which have become small 'through\r\nthe damp climate and scanty food,' seems to me, of all known cases of\r\nthe kind, the one we should most readily attribute to the direct effect\r\nof continued scanty diet; but even here we cannot altogether exclude\r\nthe possibility of the co-operation of adaptations of some kind to the\r\nvery peculiar conditions of life in these islands, as far as the feral\r\nhorses are concerned. I have not been able to find any record of more\r\nmodern exact investigations either regarding these feral horses, or in\r\nregard to the others which are reared in the Falklands under conditions\r\nof domestication. Darwin himself, however, in the Journal of his famous\r\nvoyage tells us much that is interesting in regard to the mammals of\r\nthe Falkland Islands. Cattle and horses were brought there in 1764 by\r\nthe French, and have increased greatly in numbers since that time; they\r\nroam about wild in large herds, and the cattle are strikingly large\r\nand strong, while the horses both wild and tame are rather small, and\r\nhave lost so much of their original strength that they cannot be used\r\nfor catching wild cattle with the lasso, and horses have to be imported\r\nfrom La Plata for this purpose. From this contrast between the horses\r\nand the cattle we may at least conclude that it cannot be 'scanty food'\r\nalone which causes the horses to become smaller, but that the climatic\r\nconditions as a whole are concerned in the matter. Whether the total\r\namount of variation which has taken place in the horses which have\r\nlived wild there for a hundred years would take place in the course of\r\na single life, or whether it is a cumulative phenomenon, has still to\r\nbe decided.\r\n\r\nSimilar statements, for the most part still more uncertain, are made\r\nin regard to changes in the hair of goats, sheep, cattle, cats, and\r\nsheep-dogs, which are referred to climatic influence. The raw climate\r\nof many highlands, like Tibet and Angora, is said to have directly\r\nproduced the long and fine-haired breeds. But there is a lack of proof\r\nthat adaptation or artificial selection did not also play a part, and\r\nthe fact that similar long-haired breeds have arisen among rabbits\r\nand guinea-pigs in quite different places and under quite different\r\nclimatic conditions, but under the directing care of man, speaks in\r\nfavour of our supposition. But, on the other hand, it does not seem\r\nimpossible that the climate may have a variational influence upon\r\ncertain determinants of the germ-plasm, for we have already seen\r\nthat the influence of cultivation may incite plants and animals to\r\nhereditary variations, and that slowly increasing disturbances in\r\nthe equilibrium of the determinant system may thereby be produced,\r\nwhich may suddenly find marked expression as 'mutations.' But there\r\nis little probability that _adaptations_, that is, transformations\r\ncorresponding to the altered climate, can arise in this way. The thick\r\nfur of the Arctic mammals is assuredly not a direct effect of the cold,\r\nalthough it has developed in all Arctic animals, not only in the modern\r\npolar bears, foxes, and hares of the polar regions, but also in the\r\nshaggy-haired mammoth of diluvial Siberia, whose tropical relatives of\r\nto-day, the elephants, have an almost naked skin. Another interesting\r\ncase, recently brought to light, shows that a group of animals\r\nwhich, in correspondence with their otherwise exclusively tropical\r\ndistribution, have only a moderately developed coat of hair, may, on\r\nmigrating to a cold country, grow as good a fur as the members of other\r\nfamilies. I refer to one of the higher apes, _Rhinopithecus roxellanæ_,\r\nwhich live in companies in the forest on the high mountains of Tibet,\r\nnotwithstanding that the snow lies there for six months[26].\r\n\r\n[26] See Milne-Edwards, _Recherches pour servir à l'histoire nat. d.\r\nmammifères_, Paris, 1868-74.\r\n\r\nBut we should assuredly make a mistake if we were to regard the thick\r\nfur of these apes as a direct reaction of the organism to the cold. We\r\nsee at once that this cannot be the case if we compare them with marine\r\nmammals, which differ just as much from one another in this respect\r\nand yet are exposed to the same low temperature. The whale and the\r\ndolphin are quite naked, absolutely hairless, but the seals possess a\r\nthick hairy coat. This striking difference is obviously connected with\r\nthe mode of life; the whales remain always in the water, the seals\r\nleave it often and therefore require the hairy coat, especially in\r\ncolder climates, since otherwise they would be too rapidly cooled by\r\nthe evaporation of the water from their bodies. For the whales, on the\r\nother hand, even a very thick hairy coat would not have sufficed as a\r\nprotection against cold, since water is a much better conductor of heat\r\nthan air, and so it was necessary for them to become enveloped with\r\nthe well-known thick layer of blubber, a deposit of fat lying under\r\nthe skin, and this--after it was once developed--made the hairy coat\r\nsuperfluous, so that it disappeared. The seals certainly also possess\r\na layer of fat under the skin, but it is only in the largest of them\r\nthat it affords sufficient protection against the cooling effect of\r\nevaporation when they go upon land or on the ice, and it is therefore\r\nonly in these larger ones that the hairy coat has markedly degenerated,\r\nas, for instance, in the walrus and the sea-lion; in all the smaller\r\nseals, in which the mass of the body is much less, the hairy coat is\r\nnecessarily very thick and protected from soaking by being very oily,\r\nbecause the layer of fat under the skin would not be sufficient to\r\nprevent excessive cooling when on land. But the thick coat of hair is\r\nno more _produced_ by the cold than is the layer of fat. As Kükenthal\r\nhas shown, all these characters are adaptations, and may depend here as\r\nelsewhere upon natural selection and upon the 'fluctuating' variations\r\nof the germ-plasm upon which that process is based. They are directed\r\nby personal selection because there is the need for them, and they are\r\nproduced and augmented by germinal selection.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases the _direct_ effect of external influences has\r\nnothing to do with the matter, but in other cases that alone brings\r\nabout the whole change, which is then limited to the individual and\r\ndoes not affect the species as a whole at all.\r\n\r\nPlant-galls afford striking illustration of the extraordinary changes\r\nthat may be brought about in an organism or in its parts by external\r\ninfluence in the course of the individual life. All possibility of\r\nadaptation on the part of the plant is excluded in this case. The\r\ngall can only depend upon the direct influence of a stimulus, which\r\nis exercised by the young animal, the larva, upon the cells which\r\nsurround it; and yet these cells vary to a considerable extent, become\r\nfilled with starch or form a woody layer, secrete special substances,\r\nsuch as tannic acid, in large quantities, or develop hairs, moss-like\r\ngrowths, pigments, and so on, which do not otherwise occur in that\r\nparticular part of the plant. Since Adler and Beyerinck have proved\r\nthat it is not a poison conveyed by the mother animal into the leaf or\r\nbud when laying the eggs, which gives rise to the gall-formation, the\r\nmatter has become rather clearer. We can now understand that different\r\nstimuli in succession affect the cells which enclose the larva, and\r\nthat the ordered succession of these and the exactly graded stimulation\r\nincite the cells to activity in various ways, whether to mere growth\r\nand multiplication in a given direction, or to the secretion of tannic\r\nacid, or to the formation of wood, or to the deposition of reserve\r\nmaterial, and so on. Even the feeble movements of the young larva may\r\nform a stimulus that increases with its growth; then the movements\r\nmade by the larva in feeding, and not least the different secretions\r\nemanating from the salivary glands of the animal, which must contain\r\nsome substances capable of acting as stimuli and probably changing\r\nin character as time goes on. All these factors must act as specific\r\nstimuli to the plant-cells, influencing and modifying their processes\r\nof growth and metabolism in one direction or another. In principle\r\nat least, if not in detail, we understand the possibility that\r\nthrough the ordered succession and exact balancing of these different\r\ncell-stimuli the really marvellous structure of the gall may be brought\r\nabout as the product of the direct influence, exercised only once,\r\nof the gall-insect upon the plant's parts. But the animal's power of\r\nexercising such a succession of finely graded stimuli upon the plant\r\nmust be referred to long-continued processes of selection, and the\r\nstructure of the gall, which is adapted to its purpose down to the\r\nminutest details, can thus be understood. The assumption of substances\r\nwhich can act even in minute quantities as specific cell-stimuli, which\r\nwe require to make in this attempt to explain galls, is no longer\r\nwithout corroboration since we find analogies in the Iodothyrin of\r\nBaumann, the specific secretions of the thymus and the supra-renal\r\nbodies in the higher animals, not to speak of the 'anti-toxins' of the\r\npathogenic bacteria, which are only known by their effects.\r\n\r\nThe case of plant-galls is thus of great theoretical interest because\r\nwe can exclude all preparation of the plant-cells for the stimuli\r\nexercised by the animal, since the gall is quite useless for the\r\nplant, though many have endeavoured to discover some utility. We\r\nhave therefore here a clear case of modification due to the effect,\r\nexercised once only, of external influences, an adaptation of the\r\nanimal to the mode of reaction of particular plant-tissues.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that if any inheritance of somatogenic\r\nmodifications, any transmission of the acquirements of the personal\r\npart to the germinal part, were possible at all, it would occur in this\r\ncase, for many species of gall-insects attack plants, particularly\r\noaks, in great numbers every year. It has actually been maintained\r\nthat galls may arise spontaneously, that is without the presence of a\r\ngall-insect. But no proof of this has ever been found, and the fact\r\nthat no one has paid any attention to the assertion probably implies an\r\nunconscious condemnation of the hypothesis of the transmissibility of\r\nacquired characters.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved by Nägeli's often discussed experiments on hawkweeds\r\n(_Hieracium_) that much less specialized external influences can\r\ngive rise to changes which are not hereditary. The Alpine species of\r\nhawkweed varied considerably in their whole habit in the rich soil of\r\nthe Botanic Gardens at Munich, but their descendants, when transferred\r\nto a poor flinty soil, returned to the habit of the Alpine species.\r\nThe changes which occurred in garden soil were therefore somatic and,\r\nas I have called them, 'transient,' and they did not depend upon\r\nvariations of the germ-plasm. It may be objected in regard to these\r\nexperiments that they were not continued long enough to prove that\r\nhereditary variations would not also have cropped up in consequence of\r\nthe altered conditions. But in any case they prove that marked changes\r\nin the whole body of the plant may occur without any obvious variation\r\nof the germ-plasm. This does not mean, however, that the possibility of\r\nvariations of the germ-plasm through such direct external influences\r\nis disputed. We must assume the occurrence of these on _a priori_\r\ngrounds, if we refer--as we have done--individual hereditary variation\r\nto fluctuations in the nutrition of the individual determinants of the\r\ngerm-plasm. It is probable that many general nutritive variations or\r\nclimatic factors affect the germ-plasm as well as the soma, and it is\r\nby no means inconceivable that it is not all, but only certain definite\r\ndeterminants that are caused to vary.\r\n\r\nA proof of this may be found in the results of experiments made upon\r\nthe little red-gold fire-butterfly (_Polyommatus phlæas_), to which\r\nI have briefly referred in a former lecture. This little diurnal\r\nbutterfly of the family Lycænidæ has a wide distribution and occurs\r\nin two climatic varieties. In the far north and also in the whole of\r\nGermany the upper surface is red-gold with a narrow black outer margin,\r\nbut in the south of Europe the red-gold has been almost crowded out by\r\nthe black. I reared caterpillars in Germany from eggs of _P. phlæas_\r\nfound at Naples and exposed them directly after they had entered on\r\nthe pupa-stage to a relatively low temperature (10° C.). Butterflies\r\nemerged which were not quite so black as those of Naples, but\r\nconsiderably darker than the German form. Conversely, German pupæ were\r\nexposed to greater warmth (38° C.), and these gave rise to butterflies\r\nwhich were rather less fiery gold and considerably blacker than the\r\nordinary German form. If I had to repeat these experiments I should\r\nuse a much lower temperature in the case of the cold experiments,\r\nbecause we now know from the experiments of Standfuss, E. Fischer, and\r\nBachmetjeff, that most of the pupæ of diurnal butterflies can stand a\r\ntemperature below zero for a considerable time; probably the results\r\nwould be even more marked then.\r\n\r\nBut even from the results of my former experiments we are justified\r\nin concluding that the blackening of the upper surface of the wing is\r\nreally the direct result of the increased temperature during pupahood,\r\nand that the pure red-gold results from the lowered temperature.\r\nSimilar experiments made by Merrifield with English _Phlæas_ pupæ agree\r\nexactly with mine. But we may conclude further from these experiments\r\nthat both warmth and cold only give rise to slight variations in the\r\nindividual pupæ, and that the pure red-gold of the northern form\r\nand the black of the southern are the result of a long process of\r\ninheritance and accumulation, in which the germ-plasm has been caused\r\nto vary in as far as the relevant determinants are concerned, so that\r\nthese yield the respective northern and southern forms even in less\r\nextreme temperatures.\r\n\r\nAs it is to be assumed that these determinants are present not\r\nonly in the primordium of the wing in the pupa, but also in the\r\ngerm-cells, both must be affected by the varying temperature, and, in\r\naccordance with the continuity of the germ-plasm, each variation of\r\nthese determinants, however slight, would be continued in the next\r\ngeneration. It is thus intelligible that somatic variations like the\r\nblackening of the wings through warmth appear to be directly inherited\r\nand accumulate in the course of generations; in reality, however,\r\nit is not the somatic change itself which is transmitted, but the\r\ncorresponding variation evoked by the same external influence in the\r\nrelevant determinants of the germ-plasm within the germ-cells, in other\r\nwords, in the determinants of the following generation.\r\n\r\nThis interpretation of these experiments, which I offered some years\r\nago, has been confirmed in several ways in regard to various other\r\ndiurnal Lepidoptera. By employing a temperature as low as 8° C. in\r\nthe case of fresh pupæ of various species of _Vanessa_ Standfuss\r\nand Merrifield, and especially E. Fischer, succeeded in getting\r\ngreat deviations in the marking and colour of the full-grown\r\ninsects,--so-called aberrations, such as had previously been found\r\nonly very rarely and singly under natural conditions. The deviations\r\nfrom the normal must undoubtedly be ascribed to the effect of cold,\r\nbut it does not follow that they are new forms which have suddenly\r\nsprung into existence, as many have assumed without further experiment.\r\nDixey, on the other hand, has attempted to establish, by a comparison\r\nof the different species of _Vanessa_, the phyletic development of\r\ntheir markings, and has found that these aberrations due to cold\r\nare more or less complete reversions to earlier phyletic stages. As\r\nregards the common small painted lady (_Vanessa cardui_), the small\r\ntortoise-shell butterfly (_Vanessa urticæ_), the 'Admiral' (_Vanessa\r\natalanta_), the peacock (_Vanessa io_), and the large tortoise-shell\r\n(_Vanessa polychioros_), I can agree with this interpretation, and I\r\ndo so the more readily because some years ago I suggested that the\r\nalternation of differently coloured generations of seasonally dimorphic\r\nLepidoptera might be considered as a reversion. But this by no means\r\nexcludes the possibility that other than atavistic aberrations may be\r\nproduced by cold or heat. There is nothing against this theoretically.\r\nYet we must not, without due consideration, compare these abruptly\r\noccurring variations to the sport-varieties of plants which we have\r\nalready discussed; there is an important difference between the two\r\nsets of cases. In the Lepidoptera a single interference, lasting only\r\nfor a short time, modifies the wing-marking, but in the plant varieties\r\nthe visible appearance of the variation is preceded by a long period of\r\npreparatory change within the germ-plasm. This period required for the\r\nexternal influences to take effect was already recognized by Darwin,\r\nand it has recently been named by De Vries the 'premutation period.'\r\n\r\nWe may explain these remarkable aberrations theoretically in\r\nthe following way: The determinants of the wing-scales in the\r\nwing-primordium of the young pupa are influenced by the cold in\r\ndifferent ways, some kinds of determinants being strengthened by it,\r\nothers markedly weakened, even crippled so to speak, and in this way\r\none colour-area spreads itself out more than is normal on the surface\r\nof the wing, and another less, while a third is suppressed altogether.\r\nThat this disturbance of the equilibrium between the determinants\r\nleads usually to the development of a phyletically older marking\r\npattern leads us to the conclusion that in the germ-plasm of the\r\nmodern species of _Vanessa_ a certain number of determinants of the\r\nancestors must be contained in addition to the modern ones. We might\r\neven inquire whether these were not better able to endure cold than\r\ntheir modern descendants, since their original possessors, the old\r\nspecies of the Ice age, were accustomed to greater cold, but this idea\r\nis contradicted by the experiments of E. Fischer, which go to show that\r\nthe same aberrations are evoked by abnormally high temperature. That\r\nthe old ancestral determinants are present in _different_ numbers in\r\nthe germ-plasm of the modern species, I am inclined to infer from the\r\nfact that among a large number of experiments made by me in the course\r\nof several years the aberrations have always occurred in very different\r\nnumbers in the different broods, although the greatest care was taken\r\nto have the conditions as nearly alike as possible; absolutely alike,\r\nof course, they never can be.\r\n\r\nBut it would lead me too far if I were to enter on a detailed\r\ndiscussion of these cases, which have not yet been fully worked up;\r\nonly one thing more need be mentioned, that is, that the aberrations\r\ninduced by cold are to a certain extent transmissible. Standfuss\r\nfirst succeeded in making some aberrant specimens of _Vanessa urticæ_\r\nreproduce, and from their eggs he procured butterflies which showed\r\na much slighter deviation from the normal, which however was still\r\nso decided that it could not be regarded as due to chance. I myself\r\nsucceeded in doing the same, but the deviation in this case was much\r\nslighter. But that these observed cases are rightly referred to the\r\ncold to which their parents had been subjected is proved by other\r\nobservations recently published by E. Fischer. These refer to one of\r\nthe Bombycidæ (_Arctia caja_), which flies by day, and accordingly\r\nhas a gay and very definite marking and coloration. A large number\r\nof pupæ were exposed to cold at 8° C., and some of these resulted in\r\nstriking and very dark aberrant forms (Fig. 129, _A_). A pair of these\r\nyielded fertilized eggs; in the progeny, which were reared at a normal\r\ntemperature, there were among the much more numerous normal forms a\r\nfew (17) which exhibited the aberration of the parents, though to a\r\nconsiderably less degree (Fig. 129, _B_).\r\n\r\nThis shows that the cold had affected not only the wing-primordia\r\nof the parental pupæ, but the germ-plasm as well, and at the same\r\ntime that this latter variation was less marked than that of the\r\ndeterminants of the wing-rudiments. This gives rise _to an appearance_\r\nof the transmission of acquired characters.\r\n\r\nIn the case of many of these cold-aberrations in Lepidoptera the cold\r\ngives rise to variations, but does so not by creating anything new,\r\nbut by giving the predominance to primary constituents which have long\r\nbeen present, but are usually suppressed, and so it is also among the\r\nplants. I have in mind, for instance, the interesting experiments of\r\nVöchting on the influence of light in the production of flowers in\r\nphanerogams. These showed that the common balsam (_Impatiens noli me\r\ntangere_) produces its familiar open flowers in a strong light, but\r\nin weak light only bears small, closed, so-called 'cleistogamous'\r\nflowers. But it would be utterly erroneous to suppose that the strong\r\nor weak light is the real cause, the _causa materialis_, of these two\r\nforms of flowers: the degree of illumination is merely the stimulus\r\nwhich provokes one or other of the primary constituents to development,\r\nboth kinds being present in the constitution of the plant. As has long\r\nbeen known, the balsam normally possesses two kinds of flowers, and\r\nthe slumbering primary constituents of these are so arranged that the\r\nopen flowers develop where there is a prospect of insect visits and\r\ncross-fertilization, that is, in sunny weather or in a strong light,\r\nwhile closed and inconspicuous flowers adapted for self-fertilization\r\ndevelop in weak light, that is, in shady places and in concealed parts\r\nof the plant, where insect visits are not to be expected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129. _A_, an aberration of _Arctia caja_, produced\r\nby low temperature. _B_, the most divergent member of its progeny.\r\nAfter E. Fischer.]\r\n\r\nAmong plants we find thousands of instances of such reactions of\r\nthe organism to external stimulus--reactions which are not of a\r\nprimary nature, that is, are not the inevitable consequences of\r\nthe plant's constitution, but which depend upon adaptations of the\r\nspecial constitution of a species or group of species to the specific\r\nconditions of its life. To this category belong all the phenomena of\r\nheliotropism, geotropism, and chemotropism, which have been discovered\r\nby the numerous and excellent observations of the plant physiologists.\r\nThat all these are adaptations and secondary reactions to stimuli is\r\nproved by the fact that the same stimuli affect the homologous parts of\r\ndifferent species in very different, and often in opposite ways. For\r\ninstance, while the green shoots of most plants turn towards the light,\r\nbeing positively heliotropic, the climbing shoots of the ivy and the\r\ngourd are negatively heliotropic, which is an adaptation to climbing.\r\nIn this case the reason of the difference in the mode of reaction\r\nmust lie in the difference of constitution of the cellular substance\r\nof the shoot, and since this may differentiate so very diversely in\r\nits relation to light, the power of reaction which plant substance in\r\ngeneral has to light must not be regarded as a primary character, like\r\nthe specific gravity of a metal or the chemical affinities of oxygen\r\nand hydrogen, but as adaptations of the living and varying substance\r\nto the special conditions of life. And the origin of these adaptations\r\nmust depend upon processes of selection, and on these alone. This is\r\njust the difference between living and non-living matter,--that the\r\nformer is variable to a high degree, the latter is not; it is the\r\nfundamental difference upon which the whole possibility of the origin\r\nof an animate world depends.\r\n\r\nAmong animals also we must distinguish between the direct effects of\r\nexternal influence to which the organism is not already adapted, and\r\nthose reactions which imply a previously established adjustment to the\r\nstimulus. That is, we must distinguish between primary and secondary\r\nreactions.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Herbst made artificial sea-water in which the sodium was\r\npartially replaced by lithium, and the eggs of sea-urchins developed\r\nin this artificial sea-water into very divergent larvæ of peculiar\r\nstructure. We have here a primary reaction of the organism to changed\r\nconditions of life--not an adaptation, not a prepared reaction.\r\nAccordingly these 'lithium larvæ' eventually perished.\r\n\r\nThe increasing blackness of _Polyommatus phlæas_, which we have already\r\ndiscussed, must also be regarded as a primary reaction, but not so\r\nthe variations--often misinterpreted--of those species of _Artemia_\r\nwhich live in the brine-pools of the Crimea, in regard to which\r\nSchmankewitsch showed that, when the amount of salt in the water is\r\ndiminished, they undergo certain changes which bring them nearer to\r\nthe fresh-water form _Branchipus_, while when the salt is increased\r\nin amount they vary in the contrary direction. Probably these are\r\nadaptations to the periodically changing salinity of their habitat.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt of this in the case of the caterpillars of\r\ndifferent families, in regard to which Poulton showed that in their\r\nearly youth they possess the power of adapting themselves exactly\r\nto the colour of their chance surroundings. It is obvious that the\r\nprotection which the caterpillar would gain from being coloured\r\n_approximately_ like its surroundings would be insufficient, for\r\ninstance because the surroundings may be very diverse, since\r\nthe species lives upon different, variously coloured plants and\r\nplant-parts. Thus a facultative adaptation arose. Selection gave rise\r\nto an extraordinarily specialized susceptibility on the part of the\r\ndifferent cell elements of the skin to differences of light, and the\r\nresult of this is that the skin of the caterpillar invariably takes on\r\nthe colouring which is reflected upon it in the first few days of its\r\nlife from the plants and plant-parts by which it is surrounded. Thus\r\nthe caterpillars of one of the Geometridæ, _Amphidasis betularia_, take\r\non the colours of the twig between and upon which they sit, and they\r\ncan be made black, brown, white, or light green quite independently of\r\ntheir food, according to the colour of the twigs (or paper) among which\r\nthey are reared.\r\n\r\nColour-change in fishes, Amphibians, Reptiles, and Cephalopods, depends\r\nupon much more complex adaptations. In their case a reflex-mechanism\r\nis present which conducts the light-stimulus affecting the eye to the\r\nbrain, and there excites certain nerves of the skin; these in their\r\nturn cause the movable cells of the skin which condition the colouring\r\nto change and rearrange themselves in the manner necessary to bring\r\nabout the harmonization of colour. On this depends the colour-change of\r\nthe famous chamæleon, and also the scarcely less striking case of the\r\ntree-frog, which is light green when it sits on trees, but dark brown\r\nwhen it is kept in the dark. All these are secondary reactions of the\r\norganism in which the external stimulus is, so to speak, made use of\r\nto liberate adaptive variations, either permanently or transitorily.\r\nIn the caterpillars colour-changes are permanent, that is, it is only\r\nthe young caterpillar which takes on the colour of its surroundings;\r\nlater it does not change, even when it is exposed to different light,\r\nor intentionally placed upon a food-plant of a different colour.\r\nIn fishes, frogs, and cuttlefishes, on the contrary, the reaction\r\nof the colour-cells to light only lasts a little longer than the\r\nlight-stimulus, and it changes with it. The purposiveness of this\r\ndifference of reaction is obvious.\r\n\r\nWe cannot say to what degree the direct influence of external\r\nconditions is effectively operative on the germ-plasm, or how far, by\r\npersistently repeated slight changes, the determinants and the parts\r\nof the body determined by them may be made to vary in the course of\r\ngenerations; that is to say, how large a part this direct influence\r\nof climate and food may play in the transmutation of species. We can\r\ngive no answer from experience, because there is an entire lack of\r\nperfectly satisfactory and clear experiments; we only know in a few\r\ncases how great the variations are which can be brought about in the\r\nbody during the individual life by means of any of these factors. In\r\nmost cases it is uncertain whether actually hereditary effects play any\r\npart, that is, whether the germ-plasm itself is affected. But if we\r\nwish to be theoretically clear as to how far direct climatic effects\r\nmay go, we may say this, that they may operate as long as they cause\r\nno disturbance in the life of the species concerned, for at the moment\r\nthat such a direct effect begins to be prejudicial to the species\r\npersonal selection will step in, and, by preferring the individuals\r\nwhich react least strongly to the climatic stimulus, will inhibit the\r\nvariation. If in any case this should be physically impossible, the\r\nspecies would die out in the climate in question. That a species of\r\nplant or animal has climatic limits indicates that individuals which go\r\nbeyond these are exposed to influences which make life impossible and\r\nwhich natural selection is unable to neutralize. We are here brought\r\nface to face with one of the limits to the scope of natural selection.\r\nThere is no doubt that the influences of the environment must always\r\nhave a powerful effect upon the soma of the individual, but we have\r\nseen, in the case of Alpine plants and of galls, how very far this\r\neffect may go without leaving any trace in the germ-plasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXXII\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF ISOLATION ON THE FORMATION OF SPECIES\r\n\r\n Introduction--Isolated regions are rich in endemic species--Is\r\n isolation a condition in the origin of species?--Moriz Wagner,\r\n Romanes--'Amiktic' local forms, the butterflies of Sardinia, of the\r\n Alps, and of the Arctic zone--Periods of constancy and periods of\r\n variation in species--Amixia furthered by germinal selection--The\r\n thrushes of the Galapagos Islands--The intervention of sexual\r\n selection--Humming-birds--Central American thrushes--Weaver-birds\r\n of South Africa--Papilionidæ of the Malay Archipelago--Natural\r\n selection and isolation--Snails of the Sandwich Islands--Influences\r\n of variational periods--Comparison with the edible snail and with the\r\n snail fauna of Ireland and England--Changed conditions do not always\r\n give rise to variation--Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an earlier lecture I endeavoured to show, by means of Darwinian\r\narguments and examples, how important for every species, in relation to\r\nits transmutation, is the companionship of the other species which live\r\nwith it in the same area. We saw that the 'conditions of life' operated\r\nas a determining factor in the composition of an animal and plant\r\nassociation quite as momentously as any climatic conditions whatsoever,\r\nand, indeed, Darwin rated the influences of vital association even\r\nmore highly, and attributed to them an even greater power of evoking\r\nadaptation than he granted to the physical conditions of life.\r\n\r\nWe are, therefore, prepared to recognize that even the transference of\r\na species to a different fauna or flora may cause it to vary, and this\r\noccurs when the species gradually extends the area of its distribution,\r\nso that it penetrates into regions which contain a materially different\r\nassociation of forms of life. But these migrations are not necessarily\r\nonly gradual, that is, due to the slow extension of the original area\r\nof distribution in the course of generations as the species increases\r\nin numbers; they may also occur suddenly, when isolated individuals\r\nor small companies of a species transcend in some unusual manner the\r\nnatural boundaries of the old area, and reach some distant new region\r\nin which they are able to thrive.\r\n\r\nSpecies-colonies of this kind may be due to the agency of man, who has\r\nspread many of his domesticated animals and plants widely over the\r\nearth, but who has also intentionally or unintentionally forced many\r\nwild animals and plants from their original area to distant parts\r\nof the earth, as, for instance, when the English humble-bees were\r\nimported into New Zealand with a view to securing the fertilization\r\nof the clover; but such colonies also occur in thousands of cases\r\nindependently of man's agency, and the means by which they are brought\r\nabout are very diverse. Little singing-birds are sometimes driven\r\nastray by storms, and carried far away across the sea, to find, if\r\nfortune favours them, a new home on some remote oceanic island;\r\nfresh-water snails, which have just emerged from the egg, creep on to\r\nthe broad, webbed feet or among the plumage of a wild duck or some\r\nother migratory bird, and are carried by it far over land and sea,\r\nand finally deposited in a distant marsh or lake. This must happen\r\nnot infrequently, as is evidenced by the wide distribution of our\r\nCentral European fresh-water snails towards the north and south. But\r\nterrestrial snails can also, though more rarely, be borne in passive\r\nmigration far beyond limits which are apparently impassable, as is\r\nevidenced by the presence of land-snails on remote oceanic islands.\r\n\r\nThe Sandwich Islands are more than 4,000 kilometres from the continent\r\nof America; they originated as volcanoes in the midst of the Pacific\r\nOcean; and yet they possess a rich fauna of terrestrial snails,\r\nthe beginnings of which can only have reached them by the chance\r\nimportation of individual snails carried by strayed land-birds.\r\nCharles Darwin was the first who attempted to investigate the problem\r\nof the colonization of oceanic islands by animal inhabitants, and the\r\nchapter in _The Origin of Species_ which deals with the geographical\r\ndistribution of animals and plants still forms the basis of all the\r\ninvestigations directed towards this point. We learn from these that\r\nmany land-animals, of which one would not expect it on _a priori_\r\ngrounds, may be carried away by chance over the ocean, either, as in\r\nthe case of butterflies and other flying insects, and of birds and\r\nbats, by being driven out of their course by the wind, or by being\r\nconcealed--either as eggs or as fully-formed animals--in the clefts of\r\ndriftwood, where they can resist for a considerable time the usually\r\ndestructive influence of salt water. Thus eggs of some of the lowest\r\nCrustacea (Daphnidæ), which are contained in large numbers in the mud\r\nof fresh water, may be transported with some of the mud on the feet\r\nof birds, and this may happen also to encysted infusorians and other\r\nunicellulars, and to the much more highly organized Rotifers as well.\r\nIn all these cases, and in many others, it may happen occasionally that\r\nsingle individuals, or a few at a time, may be carried far afield, and\r\nmay reach regions from which their fellows of the same species are\r\nentirely excluded. If they thrive there they may establish colonies\r\nwhich will gradually spread all over the isolated area as far as it\r\naffords favourable conditions of life.\r\n\r\nBut oceanic islands are not the only cases of isolated regions;\r\nmountains and mountain-ranges which rise in the midst of a plain also\r\nform isolation-areas for mountain-dwelling plants or animals which\r\nhave not much power of migrating. In the same way marine animals\r\nmay be completely isolated from each other by land-barriers, as the\r\ninhabitants of the Red Sea, for instance, are from those of the\r\nMediterranean, as has been clearly expounded by Darwin. The idea of an\r\nisolated region is always a relative one, and the region which seems\r\nabsolutely insular for a terrestrial snail is not so at all for a\r\nstrong-flying sea-bird. There is no such thing as _absolute_ isolation\r\nof any existing colony, for otherwise the colony could never have\r\nreached the region; but the degree of isolation may be _absolute_ as\r\nfar as the time of our observation is concerned, if the transportation\r\nof the species concerned occurs so rarely that we cannot observe it in\r\ncenturies, or perhaps in thousands of years, or if the extension of its\r\nrange could only take place through climatic or geological changes,\r\nsuch as a subsidence of land-barriers between previously separated\r\nportions of the sea, or, in the case of land animals such as snails,\r\nthe elevation of the sea-floor and the filling up of arms of the sea\r\nwhich had separated two land-areas. But even the transportation of a\r\nspecies by the accidental means already indicated will occur so rarely,\r\nif the isolated insular region is very distant, that the isolation of\r\na colony by such a chance may be regarded as almost absolute as far as\r\nthe members of the same species in the original habitat are concerned.\r\n\r\nIf we examine one of these insular regions with reference to the\r\nanimal inhabitants which live upon it in isolation, we are confronted\r\nwith the surprising fact that it harbours numerous so-called endemic\r\nspecies, that is to say, species which occur nowhere else upon the\r\nearth, and that these species are the more numerous the further the\r\nisland is removed from the nearest area of related species. It looks\r\nat first sight quite as if isolation alone were a direct cause of the\r\ntransformation of species.\r\n\r\nThe facts which seem to point in this direction are so numerous that I\r\ncan only select a few of them. The Sandwich Islands, to which we have\r\nalready referred, possess eighteen endemic land-birds, and no fewer\r\nthan 400 endemic terrestrial snails, all belonging to the family group\r\nof Achatinellinæ, which occurs there alone.\r\n\r\nThe Galapagos Islands lie 1,000 kilometres distant from the coast\r\nof South America, and they too harbour twenty-one endemic species\r\nof land-birds, among them a duck, a buzzard, and about a dozen\r\ndifferent but nearly related mocking-birds, each of which is found\r\nin only one or two of the fifteen islands. The group of islands also\r\npossesses peculiar reptiles, and they take their name from the gigantic\r\nland-tortoises, sometimes 400 kilogrammes in weight, which in Tertiary\r\ntimes inhabited also the continent of South America, but are now found\r\nin the Galapagos Islands only. The islands also possess endemic lizards\r\nof the genus _Tropidurus_, and although the lizards can no more have\r\nbeen transported across the ocean than the tortoises, but corroborate\r\nthe conclusion drawn from geological data, that the islands were still\r\nconnected with the mainland in Tertiary times, the occurrence of a\r\nparticular species of _Tropidurus_ upon almost every one of the fifteen\r\nislands testifies anew to the mysterious influence of isolation, for\r\nmost of these islands are quite isolated regions for the different\r\nspecies of lizard, even more than for the mocking-birds, which have\r\nalso split up into a series of species.\r\n\r\nWe are thus led to the hypothesis, which was first introduced into the\r\nEvolution Theory by Darwin, that the prevention of constant crossing\r\nof an isolated colony with the others of the same species from the\r\noriginal habitat favours the origin of new endemic species, and his\r\nconclusion is confirmed when we learn that islands like the Galapagos\r\ngroup possess twenty-one endemic land-birds, but only two endemic\r\nsea-birds out of eleven, for the latter traverse great stretches of\r\nsea, and crossings with others of the same species on the neighbouring\r\ncontinental coasts will often take place. The Bermuda Islands also\r\nafford a proof that the development of endemic species is prevented by\r\nregular crossing with other members of the species from the original\r\nhabitat, for although they are 1,200 kilometres distant from the\r\ncontinent of North America--that is, further than the Galapagos Islands\r\nfrom South America--they possess no endemic species of bird, and we may\r\nundoubtedly associate this with the fact that the migratory birds from\r\nthe continent visit the Bermudas every year.\r\n\r\nMadeira also confirms our conclusion, for only one of the ninety-nine\r\nspecies of bird occurring there can be regarded as endemic, and it has\r\noften been observed that birds from the neighbouring African mainland\r\n(only 240 kilometres distant) are driven across to Madeira. Terrestrial\r\nsnails, on the other hand, will seldom be carried to Madeira by birds,\r\nand accordingly we find there an extraordinary number of endemic\r\nterrestrial snails, namely, 109 species.\r\n\r\nAlthough these and similar facts indicate strongly that isolation\r\nfavours the evolution of new species, it would be erroneous to imagine\r\nthat every isolation of a species-colony conditions its transmutation\r\nto a new species, or, as has been maintained, first by Moritz Wagner,\r\nand later by Gulick and by Dixon, that isolation is a necessary\r\npreliminary to the variation of species--that not selection but\r\nisolation alone renders the transmutation of a species possible, and\r\nthus admits of its segregation into several different groups of forms.\r\nRomanes went so far as to regard the natural selection of Darwin and\r\nWallace as a sub-species of isolation, and isolation in its diverse\r\nforms he regarded as the sole factor in the formation of species. He\r\nassumed that it was only by the segregation of individuals which did\r\nnot vary that the constant reversion to the ancestral species could\r\nbe prevented, and he regarded the process of selection as essentially\r\nresulting in the 'isolation' of the fittest through the elimination of\r\nthe less-fit. The idea is correct in so far, that selection undoubtedly\r\naids the favourable variation to conquest over the old forms, precisely\r\nbecause the latter, being less favourably placed in the struggle for\r\nexistence, are gradually more completely overcome and weeded out, so\r\nthat a constant mingling of the new forms with the old is prevented,\r\njust as it is by isolation of locality. Obviously the new and fitter\r\nforms could not become dominant, could not even become permanent,\r\nif they were always being mingled again with the old. But whether\r\nit serves any useful purpose to bring this under the category of\r\n'isolation,' and to say that mingling with the ancestral form during\r\ntransmutation is prevented by natural selection, in that favourably\r\nvarying individuals _are isolated_ by their superiority from the\r\ninferior ones, that is, the non-varying individuals which are doomed\r\nto elimination, is somewhat doubtful. For my part, I should prefer to\r\nretain the original meaning of the word, and to call 'isolation' the\r\nseparation of a species-colony by spatial barriers.\r\n\r\nWhether this factor by itself prevents the mingling with the ancestral\r\nform as effectually as selection does, and whether isolation alone and\r\nby itself can lead to the evolution of new forms, or perhaps must lead\r\nto them, must now be investigated.\r\n\r\nI look at this question from exactly the same point of view as I did\r\nnearly thirty years ago, when in a short paper[27] I endeavoured to\r\nshow that, under favourable circumstances, an individual variation of a\r\nspecies may become the origin of a local variety if it finds itself in\r\nan isolated region. Suppose an island had no diurnal butterflies, until\r\none day a fertilized female of a species from the continent was driven\r\nthither, found suitable conditions of life, laid its eggs, and became\r\nthe founder of a colony; the prevention of constant crossing between\r\nthis colony and the ancestral continental species would not in itself\r\nbe any reason why the colony should develop into a variety. But suppose\r\nthat the foundress of the colony diverged in some unimportant detail of\r\ncolouring, such as may at any time arise through germinal selection,\r\nfrom the ancestral species; then this variation would be transmitted to\r\na portion of her progeny, and there would thus be a possibility that a\r\nvariety should establish itself upon the island which would be the mean\r\nof the characters of the surviving progeny. The greater the divergence\r\nwas in the first progeny of the mother-colonist, and the stronger this\r\nvariational tendency was, the greater also would be the chance that it\r\nwould be transmitted further and become a characteristic aberration\r\nfrom the marking of the original species. I then designated this effect\r\nof isolation as due to _amixia_, that is, to the mere prevention of\r\ncrossing with the members of the same species in the original habitat.\r\n\r\n[27] _Ueber den Einfluss der Isolirung auf die Artbildung_, Leipzig,\r\n1872.\r\n\r\nWe have examples of this from the Mediterranean islands, Sardinia and\r\nCorsica, which possess in common nine endemic varieties of butterflies,\r\nmost of which diverge from the species of the continent in a quite\r\ninconsiderable degree, though quite definitely and constantly. Thus\r\nthere flies in these islands a variety (_Vanessa ichnusa_) of our\r\ncommon little _Vanessa urticæ_ in which the two black spots on the\r\nanterior wing exhibited by the original species are wanting. The large\r\ntortoise-shell (_Vanessa polychloros_) also occurs there, but it has\r\nnot varied and still exhibits the black spots. Our little indigenous\r\nbutterfly (_Pararga megæra_), which is abundant on warm, stony slopes,\r\nquarries, and roads, flies about in Sardinia, but as a variety\r\n(_tigelius_), which is distinguished from the original species by the\r\nabsence of a black curved line on the posterior wings.\r\n\r\nThat of two nearly related and similarly marked species, like the large\r\nand small tortoise-shell, one should remain unvaried, while the other\r\nhas become a variety, shows us that amixia alone does not necessarily\r\nlead to the evolution of varieties in every case. It might of course be\r\nobjected that one species may have migrated to the islands at a much\r\nearlier period than the other, and that it might be a direct effect\r\nof the climate which found expression in this way. But we have other\r\nsimilar cases in which one of two species has varied in an isolated\r\nregion, while the other has not, and in regard to which we can prove\r\ndefinitely that both were isolated at the same time.\r\n\r\nAn instance of this kind is to be found in Arctic and Alpine\r\nLepidoptera, which inhabited the plains of Europe during the Glacial\r\nperiod, and subsequently, when the climate became milder again,\r\nmigrated some to the north into countries within the Arctic zone, and\r\nsome to the south to the Alps to escape in their heights from the\r\nincreasing warmth. There are many diurnal Lepidoptera which now belong\r\nto both regions, and of these some have remained exactly alike, so that\r\nthe Arctic form cannot be distinguished from the Alpine form; others\r\nshow slight differences, so that we can distinguish an Arctic and an\r\nAlpine variety. To the former category belong, for instance, _Lycæna\r\ndonzelii_ and _Lycæna pheretes_, _Argynnis pales_, _Erebia manto_,\r\nand others; to the second category belong, for instance, _Lycæna\r\norbitulus_, Prun., _Lycæna optilete_, _Argynnis thore_, and some\r\nspecies of the genus _Erebia_.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be an instance of the direct effect of general climatic\r\ninfluences, for in that case all the nearly related species of a genus\r\nwould have varied or not varied; nor have we to do with adaptations,\r\nfor the differences in marking are seen on the upper surfaces of\r\nthe wing, which do not exhibit protective colouring, at least in\r\nthese Lepidoptera. It can only have been the prevention of crossing\r\nthat has fixed the existing variational tendencies in the isolated\r\ncolonies--variations which would have been swamped and obliterated if\r\nthere had been constant crossing with all the rest of the members of\r\nthe species.\r\n\r\nBut there is another factor to be considered. Those Alpine Lepidoptera,\r\nfor instance, which have not remained exactly the same in the far\r\nnorth, have formed local varieties in the rest of the area of their\r\ndistribution also, while species which have remained quite alike\r\nin isolated regions, such as the Alps and the north, exhibit no\r\naberrations in other isolated regions, such as the Pyrenees, in\r\nLabrador, or in the Altai. Thus one species must have had a tendency\r\nin the Glacial period to form local varieties, and the other had not;\r\nand I have already attempted to explain this on the hypothesis that the\r\nformer at the time of their migration and segregation into different\r\ncolonies were at a period of dominant variability, the latter at a\r\nperiod of relatively great constancy. Leaving aside the question of\r\nthe causes of this phenomenon, we may take it as certain that there\r\nare very variable and very constant species, and it is obvious that\r\ncolonies which are founded by a very variable species can hardly ever\r\nremain exactly identical with the ancestral species; and that several\r\nof them will turn out differently, even granting that the conditions of\r\nlife be exactly the same, for no colony will contain all the variants\r\nof the species in the same proportion, but at most only a few of\r\nthem, and the result of mingling these must ultimately result in the\r\ndevelopment of a somewhat different constant form in each colonial area.\r\n\r\nIf we were to try to imitate this 'amixia' artificially we should\r\nonly require to take at random from the streets of a large town a\r\nnumber of pregnant bitches, and place each of them upon an island\r\nnot previously inhabited by dogs, and then a different breed of dog\r\nwould arise upon each of these islands, even if the conditions of life\r\nwere exactly similar. But if, instead of these variable bitches, the\r\nfemales of a Russian wolf were placed on the islands, the developing\r\nwolf-colonies would differ as little from the ancestral species as the\r\nvarious Russian wolves do from one another--similar climate and similar\r\nconditions of life being presupposed.\r\n\r\nThere is thus an evolution of varieties due to amixia alone, and we\r\nshall not depreciate the significance of this if we consider that\r\nindividual variations are the outcome of the fluctuations in the\r\nequilibrium of the determinant system of the germ-plasm, to which it\r\nis always more or less subject, and that variations of the germ-plasm,\r\nwhether towards plus or minus, bear within themselves the tendency\r\nto go on increasing in the direction in which they have begun, and\r\nto become definite variational tendencies. In isolated regions such\r\nvariational tendencies must continue undisturbed for a long period,\r\nbecause they run less risk of being suppressed by mingling with\r\nmarkedly divergent germ-plasms.\r\n\r\nThe probability that variational tendencies set up in some ids of the\r\ngerm-plasm by germinal selection will persist and increase is obviously\r\ngreater the more the germ-plasms combining in amphimixis resemble each\r\nother. For instance, let us call the varying determinants _Dv_, and\r\nassume as a favourable case that these are represented in three-fourths\r\nof all the ids in the fertilized eggs of a butterfly-female which has\r\nbeen driven astray on to an island, that is, that they are present\r\nin twelve out of sixteen ids; then of 100 offspring of the first\r\ngeneration it is possible that seventy-five or more will contain the\r\ndeterminants _Dv_, some of them in a smaller number of ids, some in a\r\ngreat number than the mother, according as the reducing division has\r\nturned out. If the pairing of the second generation be favourable--and\r\nthis again is purely a matter of chance--a third generation must arise\r\nwhich would contain the variants _Dv_ throughout, and thus the fixation\r\nof this particular variation on this particular island would be begun.\r\nIn other words, the possibility would arise, that, if individuals with\r\na majority of _Dv_ ids predominated, they would gradually come to be\r\nthe only ones, since by continual crossing with the minority which\r\npossessed only the determinants _D_, they would mingle the varied ids\r\nwith those of the descendants of these last, till ultimately germ-plasm\r\nwith only the old ids would no longer occur.\r\n\r\nIn following out this process it is not necessary to assume that the\r\nfirst immigrant possessed the variation _visibly_; if determinants\r\nvarying in a particular direction occurred in the majority of its ids,\r\nthese would, as a consequence of persistent germinal selection, go on\r\nvarying gradually until the externally visible variation appeared. This\r\nwould not have appeared at all if the animal concerned had remained\r\nin the original habitat of its species, for there it would have been\r\nsurrounded by normal germ-plasms, and its direct descendants, even if\r\nthey had been as favourably situated for the origin of variations as\r\nwe have assumed, would not have reproduced only among themselves, and\r\ntherefore even in the next generation the number of _Dv_ ids would have\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nObviously it is to a certain extent a matter of chance whether in the\r\nisolated descendants the variation or the normal form remains the\r\nvictor, for it depends on the number of _Dv_ ids originally present in\r\nthe fertilized eggs, then on the chances of reducing divisions, and\r\nfinally on the chance which brings together for pairing individuals in\r\nwhich the similarly varied ids preponderate. The probability of the\r\nconquest of the variation will depend in the main on the strength of\r\nthe majority of the varied ids in the fertilized eggs of the parents;\r\nif this be an overwhelming majority, then the chances of favourable\r\nreducing divisions and pairings will also be great. The origin of a\r\npure amixia variety will thus depend upon the fact that _the same_\r\nvariational tendency _Dv_ was present in a large number of the ids of\r\nthe ancestral germ-plasm. We need not wonder therefore that of the\r\nnumerous diurnal butterflies of Corsica and Sardinia only eight have\r\ndeveloped into endemic, probably 'amiktic,' varieties.\r\n\r\nBut since we know that so many species in oceanic islands and other\r\nisolated regions are endemic or autochthonous, i.e. of local origin,\r\nthere must obviously be some other factor in their evolution in\r\naddition to the mere prevention of crossing with unvaried individuals\r\nof the same species. The variational tendencies which have arisen in\r\nthe germ-plasm through germinal selection may--as we have already\r\nseen--gain the ascendancy in various ways; first, by being favoured\r\nby the climatic influences, then by being taken under the protection\r\nof personal selection, whether in the form of natural or of sexual\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nAs the inhabitants of insular areas are not infrequently subject to\r\nspecial climatic conditions, we may assume at the outset that many of\r\nthe 'endemic' species are climatic varieties, but in many cases this\r\nexplanation is insufficient. For instance, special local forms of\r\nmocking-bird live on several of the Galapagos Islands, but this cannot\r\ndepend upon differences of climate, for the islands are only a few\r\nkilometres apart, and resemble one another as regards the conditions\r\nof life which they present. But as the differences between these\r\nlocal forms show themselves especially in the male sex, as colour\r\nvariations of certain parts of the plumage, we must take account of\r\nsexual selection, which, though with its basis in germinal selection,\r\nhas in many islands followed a path of its own. Sexual selection\r\noperates especially in the case of sporadically occurring characters\r\nwhich are in any way conspicuous. But it is just such variations as\r\nthese that are called into existence by germinal selection, whenever it\r\nis allowed to continue its course undisturbed through a long series of\r\ngenerations. Characters of this kind, such, for instance, as feathers\r\nof abnormal structure or colour in a bird, or new colour spots in a\r\nbutterfly, make their appearance when a group of determinants has been\r\nable to go on varying in the same direction for a long time unimpeded,\r\nthat is, without being eliminated as injurious by natural selection or\r\nobliterated by crossing. This is very likely to happen in the case of\r\nan isolated area, and as soon as the conspicuous character thus brought\r\nabout makes its appearance, sexual selection takes control of it, and\r\nensures that all the individuals, that is, all the germ-plasms which\r\npossess it, have the preference in reproduction.\r\n\r\nI believe, therefore, that a large number of the endemic species of\r\nbirds and butterflies in isolated regions result from amixia based\r\nupon germinal selection, whose results have been emphasized by sexual\r\nselection. Experience corroborates this, as far as I can see, for many\r\nof the endemic species of birds in the Galapagos and other islands\r\ndiffer from one another solely or mainly in their colouring, and in\r\nmany it is especially the males which differ greatly.\r\n\r\nAs to the humming-birds we may say, without going into details\r\nregarding their sexual characters and their distribution, that the many\r\nendemic species which inhabit the Alpine regions of isolated South\r\nAmerican volcanic mountains differ from one another chiefly in the\r\nmales and in the secondary sexual characters of these. The family of\r\nhumming-birds is characteristically Neotropical, that is, it has its\r\ncentre in the Tropics of the New World, and by far the greater number\r\nof humming-bird species--there are about a hundred and fifty--occur\r\nthere only, while a few occur as migrants north of the Tropical zone,\r\nand visit the United States as far north as Washington and New York.\r\nWe know that many of the most beautiful species have quite a small\r\narea of distribution, that many are restricted to a single volcanic\r\nmountain, living in the forests which clothe its sides. These species\r\nare isolated there, for they do not migrate; apparently they cannot\r\nendure the climate of the plains, but remain always in their mountain\r\nforests. Without doubt they originated there, chiefly, I am inclined\r\nto think, through the variation of the males due to sexual selection.\r\nAny one who has seen Gould's magnificent collection of humming-birds\r\nin the British Museum in London knows what a surprising diversity of\r\nred, green, and blue metallic brilliance these birds display, what\r\ncontrasts are to be found in the diverse colour-schemes, and what\r\ndifferences they exhibit in the length and form of the feathers of the\r\nhead, of the neck, of the breast, and especially of the tail. There\r\nare wedge-shaped, evenly truncate, and deeply forked tails, some with\r\nsingle long, barbless feathers, and so on. All these characters are\r\nconfined to the males, and are at most only hinted at in the female;\r\nin no species does the female even remotely approach the male in\r\nbrilliance or decorativeness of plumage.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that so many species with very divergent plumage in\r\nthe males could have developed if they had all lived together on a\r\nlarge connected area. But here, distributed over a large number of\r\nisolated mountain forests, the decorative colouring or the distinctive\r\nshape which chances to arise through germinal selection on any of these\r\nterrestrial islands can go on increasing, undisturbed by crossing with\r\nindividuals of the ancestral species, and furthered, moreover, by\r\nsexual selection.\r\n\r\nIn this way, if I mistake not, numerous new species have arisen as a\r\nresult of isolation, and it is quite intelligible that several new\r\nspecies may have arisen from one and the same ancestral species, as we\r\nmay see from the nearly related yet constantly different species of\r\nmocking-bird on the different islands of the Galapagos group.\r\n\r\nA number of similar examples might be given from among birds. Thus\r\nDixon calls attention to the species of the thrush genus _Catharus_,\r\ntwelve of which live in the mountain forests of Mexico and of South\r\nAmerica as far as Bolivia, all differing only slightly from one another\r\nand all locally separated. They came from the plains, migrated to the\r\nhighlands, were isolated there, and then no longer varied together all\r\nin the same direction, but each isolated group evolved in a different\r\ndirection according to the occurrence of chance germinal variations:\r\none developed a chestnut-brown head, another a slate-grey mantle, a\r\nthird a brown-red mantle, and so on. From what we have already seen in\r\nregard to the importance of sexual selection in evolving the plumage of\r\nbirds, it is probable that this factor has been operative in this case\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nAnother example is afforded by the weaver-birds (_Ploceus_) of South\r\nAfrica, those ingenious singing-birds resembling blackbirds in size and\r\nform, whose pouch-shaped nests, hanging freely from a branch, usually\r\nover the water, and with their little openings on the under side, are\r\nexcellently protected from almost every form of persecution. These\r\nbirds have in South Africa split up into twenty or more species, but\r\nthe areas of each are not sharply isolated, and the division into\r\nspecies cannot, therefore, be due to isolation. But it is not difficult\r\nto guess upon what it depends, when we know that the males alone are\r\nof a beautiful yellow and black colour, while the females are of a\r\ngreenish protective colouring all over.\r\n\r\nThus, in my opinion, sexual selection plays a part more or less\r\nimportant in the origin of the numerous endemic species of diurnal\r\nLepidoptera which are characteristic especially of the islands of the\r\nMalay Archipelago, and which make the Lepidopteran fauna there so rich\r\nin individuality. A large number, indeed the majority of the types of\r\nPapilionidæ, have a peculiar species, a local form, on most of the\r\nlarger islands, which is sharply and definitely distinguished from\r\nthose of the other islands, usually in both sexes, but most markedly in\r\nthe much more brilliantly coloured males.\r\n\r\nThus each of these types forms a group of species, each of which is\r\nrestricted to a particular locality, and has usually originated where\r\nwe now find it, although of course the diffusion of one of these\r\nlarge strong-flying insects from one island to the other is in no way\r\nexcluded. As an example we may take the _Priamus_ group, the blackish\r\nyellow _Helena_ group, the blue _Ulyssus_ group, and the predominantly\r\ngreen _Peranthus_ group.\r\n\r\nIf we inquire into the causes of this divergence of forms and their\r\ncondensation into numerous species, we shall find that their roots lie\r\nin this case, as in that of all transformations, in germinal selection\r\nand the variational tendencies resulting therefrom, but we must\r\n_regard their fixation us the result of isolation_, which prevented\r\nthe variational tendencies which happened to develop on any one island\r\nfrom being neutralized and swamped by mingling with the variations of\r\nother islands. But that sexual selection took control of these striking\r\ncolour-variations and increased them still further is obvious from\r\nthe rarely absent dimorphism of the sexes. Even if the females do not\r\nconsciously select mates from among the males, they will more readily\r\naccept as a mate the one among several suitors which excites them most\r\nstrongly. And that will be the one which exhibits the most brilliant\r\ncolours or exhales the most agreeable perfume, for we know from their\r\nbehaviour in regard to flowers how sensitive butterflies are to both\r\nthese influences.\r\n\r\nAlthough isolation has an important rôle in the formation of all\r\nthese species, it seems to me an exaggeration to maintain, as many\r\nnaturalists do, that the splitting up of a species is impossible\r\nwithout isolation. Certainly the splitting up of species is, in\r\nnumerous cases, facilitated by isolation, and indeed could only have\r\nbeen brought about in its present precision by that means, but it is\r\nunderestimating the power of natural selection not to credit it with\r\nbeing able to adapt a species on one and the same area to _different_\r\nconditions of life, and we shall return to this point later on in a\r\ndifferent connexion. But in the meantime it must suffice to point out\r\nthat the polymorphism of the social insects affords a proof that a\r\nspecies may break up into several forms in the same area through the\r\noperation of natural selection alone.\r\n\r\nI am therefore of opinion, with Darwin and Wallace, that adaptation to\r\nnew conditions of life has, along with isolation, had a material share\r\nin the evolution of the large number of endemic species of snail on the\r\noceanic islands. This brings us to the co-operation of natural selection\r\nand isolation. If, thousands of years ago, by one of the rarest\r\nchances, an _Achatina_-like snail was carried by birds to the Sandwich\r\nIslands, it would spread slowly, at first unvaried, from the spot\r\nwhere it arrived over the whole of the snailless island. But during\r\nthis process of diffusion it would frequently come in contact with\r\nconditions of life which would not prevent it from penetrating further,\r\nbut to which it was imperfectly adapted, and in such places a process\r\nof transformation would begin, which would consist in the fostering of\r\nfavourably varying individuals, and which would run its course quietly\r\nby means of personal selection, based upon the never-ceasing germinal\r\nselection, and unhindered by any occasional intrusion of still unvaried\r\nmembers of the species from the original settlement on the island.\r\nBut these new conditions were not merely different from those of the\r\nancestral country; the island region itself presented very diverse\r\nconditions, to which the snail immigrant had to adapt itself in the\r\ncourse of time, as far as its constitution allowed. Terrestrial snails\r\nare almost all limited to quite definite localities with quite definite\r\ncombinations of conditions; none of our indigenous species occurs\r\neverywhere, but one species frequents the woods, another the fields;\r\none lives on the mountains, another in the valleys; one on gneiss\r\nsoil, another on limy soil, a third on rich humus, a fourth on poor\r\nriver-sand; one in clefts and hollows among damp moss, and another in\r\nhot, dry banks of loess, and so on. Although we cannot see in the least\r\nfrom the structure of the animal why this or that spot should be the\r\nonly suitable one for this or that species, we may say with certainty\r\nthat each species remains permanently in a particular place because\r\nits body is most exactly adapted to the conditions of life there, and\r\ntherefore it remains victorious in the competition with other species\r\nin that particular spot.\r\n\r\nIn this way the immigrants to the Sandwich Islands must have adapted\r\nthemselves in the course of time to their increasingly specialized\r\nhabitats, and in doing so have divided up into increasingly numerous\r\nforms, varieties, and species, and indeed into several genera.\r\n\r\nBut this alone is not sufficient to explain the facts. According to\r\nGulick's valuable researches there live on one little island of the\r\nSandwich group no fewer than 200 species of Achatinellidæ, with 600-700\r\nvarieties! This remarkable splitting up of an immigrant species is\r\nregarded by him as a result of the isolation of each individual species\r\nand variety, and I do not doubt that this is correct as far as a\r\nportion of these forms is concerned, and that isolation plays a certain\r\npart in regard to them all. Gulick, who lived a long time upon the\r\nisland, attempts to prove that the habitats of all these nearly related\r\nvarieties and species are really isolated as far as terrestrial snails\r\nare concerned; that intermingling of the snails of one valley with\r\nthose of a neighbouring one is excluded, and that the varieties of the\r\nspecies diverge more markedly from one another in proportion as their\r\nhabitats are distant. On the other hand, species of different genera\r\nof Achatinellidæ often live together on the same area; but they do not\r\nintermingle.\r\n\r\nAlthough Gulick's statements are worthy of all confidence, and though\r\nhis conclusions have great value as contributions to the theory of\r\nevolution, I do not think that he has exhausted the problem of the\r\ncauses of this remarkable wealth of forms among the terrestrial snails\r\nof oceanic islands. It is not that I doubt the relative and temporary\r\nisolation of the snail-colonies at numerous localities in the island of\r\nOahu. But why have we not the same phenomenon in Germany, in England\r\nor Ireland? Gulick anticipates this objection by pointing out the\r\npeculiar habits of the Oahu snails. Many of the species there are\r\npurely arboreal animals, living upon trees and never leaving them, even\r\nduring the breeding season, or in order to deposit eggs, for they bring\r\nforth their young alive. Active migration from forest to forest seems\r\nexcluded by the fact that on the crests of the mountains there is a\r\nless dense forest of different kinds of trees, and dry sunny air, which\r\ncould not be endured by the species of _Achatinella_ and _Bulimella_,\r\nwhich love the moist shades of the tropical forests. Active migration\r\nover the open grass-land at the mouths of the valleys is also excluded.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the isolation of these forest snails in their\r\nvalleys is for the time being very complete, and that intermingling\r\nof two colonies which live in neighbouring valleys _does not occur\r\nby active migration, within the span of one or several human\r\ngenerations_. It will also be admitted that our terrestrial snails in\r\nCentral Europe are much less isolated in their different areas, that,\r\nfor instance, they could get from one side of a mountain to the other\r\nby active migration; but we must nevertheless repeat the question: how\r\ndoes it happen that in Oahu every forest, every mountain-crest, and so\r\non, has its own variety or species, while our snails are distributed\r\nover wide stretches of country, frequently without even developing\r\nsharply defined local varieties? The large vineyard or edible snail\r\n(_Helix pomatia_) occurs from England to Turkey, that is, over a\r\ndistance of about 3,000 kilometres, and within this region it is found\r\nin many places which might quite as well be considered isolated as\r\nadjacent forest valleys in Oahu. It occurs also on the islands of the\r\nChannel and of the Irish Sea, and lives there without intermingling\r\nwith the members of the species on the mainland. But even on the\r\nContinent itself it would be possible to name hundreds of places in\r\nwhich they are just as well protected from intermingling with those of\r\nother areas as they are in Oahu. There too the snails must _somehow_\r\nhave reached their present habitat some time or other, perhaps rather\r\nin an indirect way, by means of other animals; but this is true also of\r\nthe snails of a continent, as we shall show more precisely later on.\r\nIn the meantime let us assume that this is so, and that the vineyard\r\nsnail (_Helix pomatia_), or some other widely distributed snail,\r\nis relatively isolated. _Why then have not hundreds of well-marked\r\nvarieties evolved--a special one for each of the isolated areas?_\r\n\r\nObviously there must have been something in operation in the Sandwich\r\nIslands which is absent from the continental habitats of _Helix\r\npomatia_, for this species shows fluctuations only in size, but is\r\notherwise the same everywhere, and the few local varieties of it which\r\noccur are unimportant. I am inclined to believe that this 'something'\r\ndepends on two factors, and especially on the fact that the immigrant\r\nsnail enters upon a period of variability. This will be brought about\r\nin the first place by the fact that the climate and other changes\r\nin the conditions of life will call forth a gradually cumulative\r\ndisturbance in the equilibrium of the determinant system, and thus\r\na variability in various directions and in various combinations of\r\ncharacters. To this must be added the operation of natural selection,\r\nwhich attempts to adapt the immigrant to many new spheres of life, and\r\nthus increases in diverse ways the variational tendencies afforded by\r\ngerminal selection. These two co-operating factors bring the species\r\ninto a state of flux or lability, just as a species becomes more\r\nvariable under domestication, likewise as a direct effect of change\r\nof food and other conditions, such as the consciously or unconsciously\r\nexercised processes of selection. It follows from this that, in the\r\ngradual diffusion of snails all over the island, similar localities\r\nwould almost never be colonized by exactly similar immigrants, but\r\nby individuals containing a different combination of the existing\r\nvariations, so that in the course of time different _constant forms_\r\nwould be evolved through amixia in relatively isolated localities.\r\n\r\nBut everything would be different in the diffusion of a new species\r\nof snail in a region which was already fully or at least abundantly\r\noccupied by snail-species. Let us leave out of account altogether\r\nthe first factor in variation, the changed climate, and we see that\r\na species in such circumstances would have no cause for variation,\r\nbecause it would find no area unoccupied outside of the sphere to\r\nwhich it was best adapted; it would therefore not be impelled to adapt\r\nitself to any other, and in most cases could not do so, because in each\r\nit would have to compete with another species superior to it because\r\nalready adapted.\r\n\r\nThe case would be the same if an island were suddenly peopled with\r\nthe whole snail-fauna of a neighbouring continent, with which a land\r\nconnexion had arisen. If the island had previously been free from\r\nsnails, all the species of the mainland would be able to exist there in\r\nso far as they were able to find suitable conditions of life, but each\r\nspecies would speedily take complete possession of the area peculiarly\r\nsuited to it, so that none of their fellow migrants would be impelled,\r\nor would even find it possible, to adapt themselves to new conditions\r\nand thus to become variable and split up into varieties. If Ireland\r\nwere at present free from snails, and if a land connexion between it\r\nand England came about, then the snail-fauna of England would probably\r\nmigrate quite unvaried to Ireland, and in point of fact the snail-fauna\r\nof the two islands, which were formerly connected, is almost the same.\r\nFor the same reason the fauna of England, as far as terrestrial snails\r\nare concerned, is almost the same as that of Germany.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it may be almost regarded as a law that an\r\nindividual migrant to virgin territory must become variable. This could\r\nnot be better illustrated than by the geographical distribution of\r\nterrestrial snails, which emphasizes the fact that a striking wealth of\r\nendemic species is to be found on all oceanic islands. Moreover, the\r\nfact that the number of these endemic species is greater in proportion\r\nto the distance of the island from the continent, indicates that the\r\nvariability sets in more intensively and lasts longer in proportion to\r\nthe small number of species which become immigrants in the island, and\r\nin proportion to the number of unoccupied areas which are open to the\r\ndescendants of the immigrant species. This is undoubtedly the reason\r\nwhy the Sandwich Islands do not possess _a single species_ which occurs\r\nelsewhere, and the segregation of the unknown ancestral form into many\r\nspecies and several (four) sub-genera is also to be interpreted in the\r\nsame way. There was probably in this case only one immigrant species,\r\nwhich found a free field, and adapted itself in its descendants to\r\nall the conditions of snail-life which obtained there, and in doing\r\nso split up into numerous and somewhat markedly divergent forms. But\r\nthe number of different forms is much greater than the number of\r\ndistinctive habitats, as Gulick indicates and substantiates in detail,\r\nfor similar areas, if they are relatively isolated from one another,\r\nare inhabited not by the same forms, but by different though nearly\r\nrelated varieties, and this depends on the fact that from the species\r\nwhich was in process of varying a different combination of variations\r\nwould be sent out at different periods, and the temporary isolation\r\nwould result in the evolution of special local varieties.\r\n\r\nBut I do not believe that this would continue for all time. I rather\r\nthink that these--let us say--representative varieties would diminish\r\nin numbers in the course of a long period. For the isolation of single\r\nvalley-slopes or of particular woods is not permanent, individuals are\r\nliable to be carried from one to another in the course of centuries as\r\nthey were at the beginning of the colonization of the isolated woods;\r\nforests are cleared or displaced by geological changes, connexions are\r\nformed between places, which were formerly separated, and in the course\r\nof another geological period the number of representative varieties,\r\nand probably even of species, will have diminished considerably,--the\r\nformer will have been fused together, the latter in part eliminated.\r\nEven now Gulick speaks regretfully of the decimation of rare local\r\nforms by their chief enemies, the mice.\r\n\r\nBut even if the number of endemic forms in insular regions diminishes\r\nfrom the time when they were first fully taken possession of, it\r\nnevertheless remains a very high one, for even now Madeira possesses\r\n104 endemic terrestrial snails, the Philippines have more than the\r\nwhole of India, and the Antilles as many as the whole American\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nMany naturalists believe that each isolated variety must diverge\r\nfurther and further from its nearest relatives as time goes on.\r\nAlthough I entirely admit that this is possible, for I have endeavoured\r\nto show that variational tendencies which have once arisen in the\r\ngerm-plasm go on in the same direction until they are brought to a full\r\nstop in some way or other, yet I cannot admit that this must always\r\nbe so. The species which has been carried to a strange area need not\r\nalways contain particular variational tendencies in its germ-plasm, and\r\nneed not in every case be impelled to such variations by the influence\r\nof new conditions. We know species which have made their way into new\r\nregions, and, without varying at all, have held their own with, or\r\neven proved superior to, the species which were already settled there.\r\nMany cases of this kind are known, both among plants and animals;\r\nthese have been brought by man, intentionally or by chance, from one\r\ncontinent to another, and have established themselves and spread over\r\nthe new area. I need only recall the evening primrose (_Œnothera\r\nbiennis_[28]), whose fatherland is Virginia, but whose beautiful big\r\nyellow blossoms now display themselves beside nearly every river in\r\nGermany, having migrated stream-upwards along the gravelly soil; or\r\nthe troublesome weed (_Erigeron canadense_), which is now scarcely\r\nless common in our gardens than in those of Canada; or the sparrow\r\n(_Passer domesticus_), which was introduced into the United States to\r\ndestroy the caterpillars, but which preferred instead to plunder the\r\nrich stores of corn, and in consequence of these favourable conditions\r\nincreased to such an extent that it has now become a veritable pest,\r\nall imaginable means for its extirpation having been tried--as yet,\r\nhowever, with no great results.\r\n\r\n[28] This was written before the appearance of the researches which\r\nDe Vries has made on the variations of _Œnothera_ in Europe. Thus\r\nthe illustration may not be quite apposite, for it seems to remain\r\nundetermined whether the 'mutations' which occur in Holland do not also\r\noccasionally appear in America. See end of lecture xxxiii.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases the migration is certainly of recent date, and it is\r\nquite possible that, when a longer time has elapsed, some variations\r\nwill take place in the new home, but in any case these instances\r\nprove that an immigrant species can spread over its new area without\r\nimmediately varying.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it must be admitted that species which have belonged to\r\ntwo continents ever since Tertiary times need not have diverged since\r\nthat time, and we know, for instance, thirty-two species of nocturnal\r\nLepidoptera which are common to North America and to Europe and yet\r\nexhibit no differences, while twenty-seven other nocturnal Lepidoptera\r\nare, according to Grote, represented in America by 'vicarious' species,\r\nthat is, by species which have varied slightly in one or other of the\r\ntwo areas, perhaps in both.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: we must undoubtedly admit that isolation has a considerable\r\ninfluence in the evolution of species, though only in association\r\nwith selection in its various grades and modes, especially germinal\r\nselection, natural selection, and sexual selection. We can say\r\ngenerally that each grade and mode of selection will more readily lead\r\nto the transformation if it be combined with isolation. Thus germinal\r\nselection may call forth slight divergences in colour and marking,\r\nwhich will be permanent if the individuals concerned are in an isolated\r\nregion. In isolation these variations will increase undisturbed, and\r\nin some circumstances will be intensified by sexual selection, so that\r\nthe male sex will vary alone in the first place, though the female\r\nmay follow, so that ultimately the whole species will be transformed.\r\nFinally, the most marked effect of isolation is seen when individual\r\nmembers of a species are transferred to virgin territory which offers\r\nunoccupied areas, suitable not to one particular species alone, but to\r\nmany nearly related species, so that the immigrant colony can adapt\r\nitself to all the different possibilities of life, and develop into a\r\nwhole circle of species. But we saw that such an aftergrowth of new\r\nforms, whether varieties, species, or even genera, may far exceed the\r\nnumber of different kinds of localities, if there be relative isolation\r\nbetween the different groups of immigrants within the insular region,\r\nas happens in the case of slow-moving animals like the terrestrial\r\nsnails, or of small singing-birds, to which each island of a little\r\narchipelago is a relatively isolated region (Galapagos).\r\n\r\nWe may thus fully recognize the importance of local isolation without\r\nregarding the absence of crossing with the members of the species in\r\nthe original habitat as the sole cause of species-formation, without\r\nsetting 'isolation' in the place of the processes of selection.\r\nThese last, taken in the wide sense, always remain the indispensable\r\nbasis of all transformations, but they certainly do not operate\r\nonly in the form of personal selection, but, wherever indifferent\r\ncharacters are concerned, in that of germinal selection. Here, too,\r\nwe see the possibility of reconciliation with those naturalists who\r\nregard transformations as primarily dependent upon internal forces of\r\ndevelopment. The fact is that _all variations depend upon internal\r\ncauses_, and their course must be guided by forces which work in an\r\norderly way. But the actual co-operation of all these forces and\r\nvariations is not predetermined, but depends to a certain extent upon\r\nchance, for of the possible modes of evolution the one which gains\r\nthe upper hand in the play of forces at the moment is alone followed,\r\nthe better are everywhere preferred, from the most minute vital units\r\nof the germ-plasm, up to the struggle between individuals and between\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXXIII\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE SPECIFIC TYPE\r\n\r\n Transition species of Celebes snails, according to Sarasin--Possible\r\n variations in the shell due to nutrition--Natural selection plays a\r\n part--Germinal selection--Temporary transitions between species--The\r\n fresh-water snails of Steinheim--How do sharply-defined species\r\n arise?--Nägeli's Developmental Force--The species a complex of\r\n adaptations--Adaptive differences between species--Adaptive nature of\r\n specific characters--The case of Cetaceans--Of birds--Additional note:\r\n the observations and theories of De Vries.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur study of the influence which geographical isolation may have in\r\ntransforming old and giving rise to new forms of life has led us\r\nnaturally to a much more important problem, that of the origin of\r\nspecies as more or less sharply defined groups of forms, and I wish\r\nto make the transition to this problem by discussing another case of\r\nspecies-splitting effected in association with, or, as is usually\r\nsaid, _through_ isolation. The naturalists Paul and Fritz Sarasin,\r\nwell known through their excellent studies on many components of\r\nthe tropical fauna, have published in their latest work interesting\r\ndiscoveries in regard to the terrestrial snails of Celebes. These\r\nobservations show that on this island a great transformation of snails\r\nhas taken place, even since the later Tertiary period. A large number\r\nof new species of snail have arisen on this island since that time,\r\nand this, as the authors show to be probable, in association with\r\nthe receding of the sea, that is, with the elevation of the island\r\nfurther out of the water, and thus with the increase of its surface.\r\nThe modern terrestrial snails show chains of forms connected in many\r\nways so that a series of species is connected by transition forms, and\r\ntherefore does not really consist of separate species at all, although\r\nthe extremes would seem to be separate species if they were studied\r\nby themselves without taking the transition forms into account. The\r\nstate of things is exactly as if a Tertiary snail had spread from any\r\nsmall area over the whole island, and had been transformed slowly\r\nand in a definite direction in accordance with its distance from its\r\nstarting-point. It is thus that we must interpret this discovery;\r\nwe have here, beside each other in space, and indeed often disposed\r\nalong geographical lines, the individual stages of a phyletic process\r\nof transformation, which has reached different levels at different\r\nplaces. One of the longest of these chains of forms is that of _Nanina\r\ncincta_, which runs across the island from east to west, and, beginning\r\nwith the smallest and most delicate forms, ascends through many\r\nintermediate stages to the giant form _N. limbifera_. Such chains of\r\nforms have been previously recognized; thus Kobelt described one in the\r\ncase of the Sicilian land-snails of the genus _Iberus_, and other cases\r\nare recorded in literature, but in all instances they refer to areas\r\nwhich must be regarded as isolated for the snails, and which have been\r\ncolonized from a single starting-point.\r\n\r\nWe have now to inquire whether and how we can explain the origin of\r\nthese chains of forms. The cousins Sarasin tell us how they at first\r\nattempted to refer the differences between the individual links of such\r\na chain to the diverse influence of the external conditions of life,\r\nbut in vain; neither the height above sea-level nor the character of\r\nthe soil was sufficient, and natural selection was no more so; 'for\r\nwhy should a high _Obba_-form twisted like a beehive be either better\r\nor worse equipped for the struggle for existence than a smaller and\r\nflatter one?' It is true that we do not understand why, but this does\r\nnot seem to me any reason to doubt that natural selection should be\r\nregarded as one of the causes of the divergence of these species,\r\nfor we could not answer the same question in regard to any of the\r\nother structural differences between two species of snail, for the\r\nsimple reason that we have far too little knowledge of the biological\r\nvalue of the parts of a snail. Or could any one tell of what use it\r\nwould be to a snail-species to have the horns slightly longer, the\r\nfoot somewhat narrower, the radula beset with rather larger or more\r\nnumerous teeth? We might indeed imagine many ways in which it might\r\nbe of advantage, but we are not in a position to say definitely why,\r\nfor instance, longer horns should be better for one species than for\r\nanother, and yet we do not believe that the structure of snails is\r\nless well adapted to the life of each species than that of any other\r\nanimals. The snail's structure is certainly built up of hundreds and\r\nthousands of adaptations, like that of every other animal species,\r\nbut while in many others we can, at least in part, recognize the\r\nadaptations as such, we cannot do so at all in regard to the snail.\r\nSimroth has pointed out that the spiral asymmetrical shell bears a\r\nrelation to the one-sided opening of the genital organs, but that only\r\nstates the general reason for the coiling of the shell. In studying the\r\ndifferences in the shell one is apt to think of its external appearance\r\nalone, of the protection which it affords to the soft internal organs\r\nof the easily wounded animal; perhaps also of the distribution of\r\nweight, which must be different in a high tower-like structure and a\r\nlow flat spiral; possibly, too, of the varied obstacles and resistance\r\nthe snail has to encounter in creeping into clefts and holes, or among\r\na tangle of plants, according to the form of its shell; but is it not\r\nalso conceivable that the form of the shell has been determined by its\r\ncontents? As Rudolph Leuckart taught, the snail may be regarded as\r\ncomposed of two parts, one of which is formed by the head and foot,\r\nthe other by the so-called 'visceral sac': the former may be called\r\nthe animal half, because it chiefly contains the dominant organs--the\r\nnerve-centres, almost the whole mass of muscle, and the sense-organs;\r\nthe latter the vegetative half, since it contains the main mass of the\r\nnutritive and reproductive systems--the stomach and intestine, the\r\nlarge liver, the heart, the kidneys, the reproductive organs, and so\r\non. The vegetative half of the animal is always concealed within the\r\nshell; would not therefore any great variation in the size of liver,\r\nstomach, intestine, and so on, bring with it a variation in the size\r\nand form of the shell, as well as in the expansion or contraction of\r\nits coils? And might not such variations become necessary because of\r\nsome change in the food-supply? It is only a supposition, but it seems\r\nto me very probable that becoming accustomed to a new diet, less easily\r\nbroken up and dissolved and of diminished nutritive value, would cause\r\nmodification not only of the radula and jaw-plate, but also of the\r\nstomach and the liver, the intestine and the kidneys, whose activity\r\nis closely associated. The stomach must become more voluminous, the\r\nliver which yields the digestive fluid must become more massive, and\r\nso forth. I will not follow this hypothetical example further, for I\r\nmerely wished to recall the fact that the snail shell, to the form\r\nof which no biological significance can be commonly attributed, is\r\nactually a sort of external cast of the visceral sac, and consequently\r\ndependent on the variations to which that is liable in accordance\r\nwith the conditions of its life. To give precise proofs for such\r\nprocesses is certainly not yet possible, for we do not even know with\r\ncertainty what the diet of the various species of snail is, much less\r\nthe difference between the modes of nutrition in two varieties, or the\r\nnutritive value of the materials used, or the changes in secretion,\r\nabsorption, assimilation, and excretion which must be brought about by\r\nthese differences. But we can at least see that variations in nutrition\r\nmust be enough in themselves to give rise to new adaptations in the\r\nsize, constitution, and mutual adaptation of the internal vegetative\r\norgans, and we cannot overlook the possibility that the form and\r\nsize of the vegetative half, and therefore the form and size of its\r\nsecretion, the shell, may also be caused to vary[29]. The fact that we\r\ncannot recognize, for instance, the beehive shape of an _Obba_ as an\r\nadaptation, is thus no proof that it is not one. But let us assume for\r\nthe moment that it is not, and that it cannot be referred to natural\r\nselection any more than the other variations in the Celebes chain of\r\nforms, and we may further admit that they cannot be referred to sexual\r\nselection, still less to some 'inherent principle of perfecting,' not\r\nonly because there is no question of perfecting in the matter, but\r\nbecause such a mystical principle is outside of the scope of natural\r\nhistory and its principles of interpretation.\r\n\r\n[29] That this suggestion was not unjustified is evident from a\r\nrecent contribution by Simroth ('Ueber die Raublungenschnecken,'\r\n_Naturwissenschaftliche Wochenschrift_, December 8 and 15, 1901). In\r\nthis paper the author, who is an expert as regards the biology of\r\nGastropods, shows that a change of diet may evoke many kinds of changes\r\nin the structure of the food-canal, which may indirectly compel changes\r\nin the shell. Thus in a small indigenous snail, _Daudebardia_, the\r\npharynx has grown so enormously in thickness and length in adaptation\r\nto the predatory mode of life, that the head and the anterior part of\r\nthe body can no longer be retracted within the shelter of the shell.\r\nFor this reason, and also because of the snail's habit of following\r\nearthworms into their burrows, the shell has been shunted far back and\r\nobliquely downwards. It has at the same time markedly changed in its\r\nshape, as may still be verified by comparing the form of the shell in\r\nthe young stages with that of the adult.\r\n\r\nBut that transformations in a definite direction can and must arise\r\nfrom fresh disturbances in the equilibrium of the determinant system,\r\nthat is from germinal selection, we have already shown.\r\n\r\nEven if the changes of form with which we are here dealing had really\r\nno biological importance, they might quite well have been brought about\r\nby germinal selection, and only one thing remains obscure, that is,\r\nwhy the different stages on the path of distribution of a species are\r\nat a different level of evolution and not all at the same level. Why\r\nhave not all been transformed? Why have some colonies remained near\r\nthe ancestral form, while others have varied only a little, and others\r\nagain a great deal? This cannot be explained by any assumption of an\r\ninternal power of development, and the explanation can only be found\r\nin germinal selection associated with isolation, since the internal\r\nprocesses in the germ-plasm can quite well run a different course in\r\ndifferent colonies. Nevertheless I am inclined to infer from these\r\ndifferences in the individual colonies of these chains of forms, that\r\nnatural selection in the accepted sense has also played a part in the\r\nevolution of these snail varieties.\r\n\r\nSuch series of forms are especially interesting, because they show us\r\nthe process of species-formation in its different stages beside each\r\nother in space, and thus simultaneously. They represent, so to speak,\r\na horizontal branch of the genealogical tree of the species, as the\r\nSarasins well express it, that is, a series of species arising from\r\neach other, which do not break off, but are all capable of life at\r\nthe same time, and so exist simultaneously on different areas; they\r\nare species adapted to different localities, not to different times.\r\nThe same is true of the snails of other isolated regions, except that\r\nthe chains of forms are usually not simple, but split up into several\r\nchains of forms arising from one ancestral form, and under certain\r\ncircumstances each of these may break up into two or more diverging\r\nseries. The great number of related species in Madeira, or in the\r\nSandwich Islands, compels us to this assumption, although the branching\r\nof the genealogical trees can no longer be demonstrated with certainty.\r\n\r\nThis splitting up of forms into several series on a varied insular\r\nregion shows us once more that it is germinal selection alone which\r\nforms the basis of all transformations, and that there is not, as\r\nearlier naturalists, especially the botanists Nägeli and Askenasy,\r\nmaintained, any peculiar impelling Force of Development innate in\r\norganisms. If there were such a force, a species would be obliged to\r\ngo on continuously in the same direction, exactly like the Sarasins'\r\nchains of forms, but no breaking of the species into one or many forms\r\ncould occur. But this breaking up into series is easy to understand\r\nwhen we take germinal selection into consideration, for the germ-plasm\r\ncontains many ids and determinants, and each of these can enter upon\r\nnew variations, so that one colony can vary in this direction, another\r\nin that, and a great diversity of forms living in isolation must, or at\r\nleast may be the result, as we see in the case of the Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\nLet us delay a moment over the Sarasins' case of the Celebes snails. We\r\nare dealing here with series of forms in regard to which the ordinary\r\nconception of species fails us, for they contain varieties whose\r\nextremes are as far apart as distinct species usually are, which are\r\nnot, however, distinct, since they are connected with one another by\r\none and often by several transition forms. Thus we can only break them\r\nup into two or more 'species' by an arbitrary division at one place or\r\nother. The phenomenon itself is not new to us; we have seen that even\r\nLamarck and Treviranus made use of similar series of forms, connected\r\nby transition stages, in their attack upon the old theory of creation,\r\nand sought to prove by means of these that the idea of species is an\r\nartificial one, read into nature by man, and not innate in nature, and\r\nthat the forms of life were only apparently fixed and sharply defined,\r\nbeing in reality in process of slow transformation. Such beautiful\r\nand convincing examples as we now possess were not available at that\r\ntime, but it might even then be said that it was the easier to make\r\na new species the fewer examples one had to deal with, and the more\r\ndifficult the more numerous these became, because with the number of\r\nindividuals, especially if they come from a wide area, the number and\r\ndiversity of the divergences increases also, so that in many cases, as\r\nin that of the Celebes snails, it becomes impossible to draw a line\r\nbetween the different species.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many animal and plant forms which do not show such\r\nmarked divergences, but rather exhibit a great harmony of individuals\r\neven in detail, and the conception of species is more readily applied\r\nto these. It would certainly be foolish to give it up, since we should\r\nthen lose all possibility of arriving at any sort of orientation\r\namong the enormous wealth of forms in nature. But at the same time we\r\nmust not forget that these 'typical' species only appear so to our\r\nshort-sighted vision--short-sighted as far as time is concerned--and\r\nthat they are connected from long-past times with 'species' which\r\nlived at an earlier date, by just such transition stages as connect\r\nthe Celebes species of to-day, which are all living at the same\r\ntime. The world of life on the earth only presents at any given time\r\na 'cross-section of its genealogical tree,' and according as its\r\nbranches grow out vertically or horizontally we receive an impression\r\nof typical, sharply defined species or of circles or chains of forms.\r\nIn the first case the evolution of new species was associated with the\r\ndying out of the horizontal branches, and the end-twigs of the branch\r\nstand beside each other now apparently isolated and sharply defined;\r\nin the other case only a portion of the ancestral species has been\r\ntransmuted, and the other part continues to live alongside of the\r\nspecies derived from it, and perhaps repeats the process of giving off\r\na varied race of descendants.\r\n\r\nThe last thirty years have yielded much palæontological evidence of\r\nthe successive stages of species-transformation. In quietly deposited\r\nhorizontal strata of the earth's crust, lying one above another, the\r\nwhole phyletic history of a group of snail-species has repeatedly\r\nbeen found in historic order, the oldest in the deepest layer, the\r\nyoungest in the uppermost, and the numerous and often very divergent\r\n'species' of a particular deposit are connected by transition forms in\r\nthe intermediate strata. From the point of view of time, therefore,\r\nthese are not 'typical' species, but circles of forms in a state of\r\nvariability.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful of such cases are the _Planorbis_ species from the\r\nsmall lacustrine deposits of Steinheim in Swabia, the _Paludina_ strata\r\nof Slavonia, and various groups of Ammonites.\r\n\r\nThese cases have been described and discussed so often that I need only\r\nrefer to their most essential features.\r\n\r\nThe _Planorbis_ strata of Steinheim were first investigated, from\r\nthe point of view of the theory of descent, by Hilgendorf (1866).\r\nHe described nineteen different varieties, which, as they are all\r\nconnected in chronological succession with each other, he grouped\r\ntogether under the name of _Planorbis multiformis_. These little\r\nfreshwater snails are found in millions in the strata of the former\r\nlake-basin of Steinheim, and they are arranged in so orderly and\r\nregular a manner that two observers, working independently and at\r\ndifferent times, succeeded in building up the genealogical tree\r\nin almost the same way. According to Alpheus Hyatt, the later\r\ninvestigator, all the forms are derived from one ancestral form,\r\n_Planorbis lævis_, from which four different series have descended, one\r\nof them splitting up again into three subordinate series.\r\n\r\nAll the individual members of these series are connected by\r\nintermediate forms in such a manner that a long period of constancy of\r\nforms seems to be succeeded by a shorter period of transformation, from\r\nwhich again a relatively constant form arises.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that the idea of species is fully justified in\r\na certain sense; we find indeed at certain times a breaking up of\r\nthe fixed specific type, the species becomes variable, but soon the\r\nmedley of forms clears up again and a new constant form arises--_a new\r\nspecies_, which remains the same for a long series of generations,\r\nuntil ultimately it too begins to waver, and is transformed once\r\nmore. But if we were to place side by side the cross-sections of this\r\ngenealogical tree at different levels, we should only see several\r\nwell-defined species between which no intermediate forms could be\r\nrecognized; these would only be found in the intermediate strata.\r\n\r\nThe problem we have now to discuss is, how it comes about that\r\nrelatively sharply defined species exist which are connected with\r\nancestral forms further back, but which form among themselves an\r\nexclusive, more or less homogeneous, host of individuals. How does it\r\nhappen that we everywhere find a specific type, and not an endless\r\nnumber of individual forms connected with one another in all directions?\r\n\r\nThis would require no further explanation if a phyletic evolutionary\r\nforce impelled the forms of life to vary in a definite manner, and thus\r\nto become transmuted into new forms in the course of generations. In\r\nthat case the whole genealogical tree of the organisms on the earth\r\nmust have been potentially contained in the lowest moneron, so that,\r\ngiven time and the most indispensable general conditions of existence,\r\nthe living world just as we know it must have resulted. Nägeli was the\r\nfirst to express this view, and he followed it out consistently, not\r\neven hesitating to deny the existence of all processes of selection,\r\nand to represent the whole of evolution as a process conditioned by\r\nthis phyletic force, which would have given rise to the world of\r\norganisms which has actually arisen, even if the conditions of life at\r\nthe different periods of the earth's history had been other than they\r\nwere. I have always combated this idea, without however overlooking\r\nthat it is based upon facts which--at that time at any rate--gave it a\r\ncertain justification. We cannot pass it by without giving some other\r\ninterpretation of the facts. Following Nägeli, the botanist Askenasy\r\nchampioned this view of 'variation in a different direction,' which\r\ngives rise to new forms; and in more recent times Romanes, Henslow,\r\nand Eimer expressed similar views, and--although they did not actually\r\ndispute the existence of processes of selection--they attributed a much\r\nless important rôle to them, and referred the phyletic genealogical\r\ntree of organisms in the main to other and internal causes.\r\n\r\nLike Nägeli himself, his followers have laid stress upon the fact that\r\nnatural selection cannot be the cause of the evolution and succession\r\nof particular species, because the differences which separate species\r\nfrom species are not of an adaptive nature, and therefore cannot\r\ndepend upon selection; but if the step from one species to the next\r\nsucceeding one does not depend upon adaptation, then the greater steps\r\nto genera, families, and orders cannot be referred to it either,\r\nsince these can only be thought of as depending upon a long-continued\r\nsplitting up of species. Genera, families, and all higher groups\r\nmust be recognized as conventional categories, not as real divisions\r\nexisting in nature itself. Even Treviranus and Lamarck maintained that\r\nthe differences between genera depended just as much upon our estimate,\r\nour intellectual convenience, as do the differences between species.\r\nAll forms were originally connected, though they may not be so now, and\r\nif the species are really not distinguished by adaptive characters,\r\nthen neither are any other grades of our classificatory system,\r\nneither order nor classes, since they all depend originally on the\r\ntransmutation of species. It was therefore quite consistent of Nägeli\r\nto seek the mainspring of organic evolution, not in adaptation, but in\r\nan unknown evolutionary force. Thus he refused to recognize adaptation\r\nas a consequence of selection, but regarded it, as Lamarck had done,\r\nas the direct effect of external conditions, and as an entirely\r\nsubordinate factor in the transmutation of forms.\r\n\r\nNägeli and his modern successors conceive of phyletic evolution as\r\ndepending upon definitely directed variation, resulting from internal\r\ncauses and occurring at definite times, which of necessity causes the\r\nexisting form to be transformed into a new one. To them the species\r\nappears, so to speak, as a vital crystallization, or to use Herbert\r\nSpencer's phraseology, as an equilibrium of living matter, which\r\nbecomes displaced from time to time, and passes over into a new state\r\nof equilibrium, being transmuted into a new species, something like the\r\npictures in a kaleidoscope. The species is thus something conditioned\r\nfrom within, which must be as it is and could not be otherwise, just\r\nlike a crystal which crystallizes in one particular system and not\r\nin another; it must be just thus or it could not be at all. From the\r\npoint of view of this theory it would be easy to understand that the\r\nthousands or millions of individuals composing a species all agree in\r\nessentials--that a specific type exists.\r\n\r\nBut this conception can hardly be entirely correct, although there is\r\nsome truth at its foundation, namely, that germinal variations which\r\narise independently are the basal roots of all transmutation. But the\r\nspecies is not simply the result of these internal processes, it is\r\nnot even mainly so; it is not the result of an internal, definitely\r\ndirected developmental force, even if we attempt to think out such a\r\nforce in a purely scientific or mechanical, instead of a mystical,\r\nsense. It seems clear to me that the species is not a life-crystal in\r\nthe sense that it must, like a rock-crystal, take form in a particular\r\nway and in no other for purely internal reasons and by virtue of\r\nits physical constitution; the species is essentially a complex of\r\nadaptations, of modern adaptations which have been recently acquired,\r\nand of inherited adaptations handed down from long ago--a complex which\r\nmight quite well have been other than it is, and indeed must have been\r\ndifferent if it had originated under the influence of other conditions\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nBut of course species are not exclusively complicated systems of\r\nadaptations, for they are at the same time 'variation-complexes,'\r\nthe individual components of which are not all adaptive, since they\r\ndo not all reach the limits of the useful or the injurious. All\r\ntransformations arise from a basis of spontaneous chance variations,\r\njust as all forest plants grow from the soil of the forest, but do not\r\nall grow into trees, the adaptive forms which determine the essential\r\ncharacter of the forest; for many species remain small and low, like\r\nthe mosses, grasses, and herbs; and these too have a share, though a\r\nsubordinate one, in determining the character of the forest, which\r\ndepends definitely, though only partially, on the loftier growths.\r\n\r\nAccording to my view all adaptation depends on an alteration in\r\nthe equilibrium of the determinant system, such as must arise from\r\nintra-germinal or even general fluctuations in the nutritive supply,\r\naffecting larger or smaller groups of determinants and causing\r\nvariation in them to a greater or less degree. And these variations\r\nmay be in a quite definite direction, persisted in for internal\r\nreasons, as we have already seen in the section dealing with germinal\r\nselection. These variations are the building-stones out of which,\r\nunder the guidance of personal selection, a new specific type, that\r\nis, a new complex of adaptations, can be established. In this type\r\nmany indifferent characters are involved, which are just as constant\r\ncharacters of the species as the adaptations.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of the selection theory have often urged against it\r\nthis constancy of indifferent characters, but as soon as we cease to\r\nrestrict the principle of selection to 'persons,' and extend it also\r\nto the lower categories of vital units, the occurrence of indifferent\r\ncharacters is easily understood. To illustrate characters of this kind,\r\nHenslow has recently called attention to the species of gentian, whose\r\nflowers have a corona split into five tips in some species and into\r\nsix or seven in others, and we cannot possibly ascribe any biological\r\nsignificance to these specific characters. It is quite possible that\r\nthey possess none; but did not even Darwin express his belief that many\r\npeculiarities of form 'are to be attributed to the laws of growth, and\r\nto the mutual influence of parts,' forces which he rightly refrained\r\nfrom including under 'natural selection' in his sense of the word,\r\nbut which we now regard as an expression of intra-selection or of\r\nhistonal selection? It is this, in our opinion, which brings about the\r\nco-adaptation of the parts to form a harmonious whole, which admits of\r\nthe primary adaptations to the conditions of life being followed or\r\naccompanied by correlative secondary variations, and which plays an\r\nimportant part in directing the course of every individual development,\r\nand is therefore uninterruptedly active within the organism. We cannot\r\nanalyse the factors precisely enough to be able to demonstrate in an\r\nindividual case why the corona should be divided into four in one\r\nspecies of gentian and into five in another, but we can understand\r\nin principle that all adaptations of a species which are not primary\r\nare determined by the compelling influence of intra-selection. And\r\nwe need not now rest content even with that, for we know that this\r\nintra-selection--as we have already seen--is active within the\r\ngerm-plasm, and it is only a logical consequence of the principle of\r\ngerminal selection to suppose that variations of definite determinants\r\ndue to personal selection may in the germ-plasm itself give rise\r\nto correlative variations in determinants next to them or related\r\nto them in any way, and that these may possess the same stability\r\nas the primary variation. This seems to me a sufficient reason why\r\nbiologically unimportant characters may become constant characters of\r\nthe species. Correlation is not effected only in the perfect organism;\r\nit exists at every period of its life, from the germ till death, and\r\nwhat it brings about is quite as inevitable as what is evoked through\r\nadaptation by means of personal selection.\r\n\r\nWe can thus also understand that indifferent characters may be\r\ncontained not only in individual ids of the germ-plasm, but also\r\ncoincidentally in a great majority of them, as soon as we think of\r\nthem as dependent upon the characters established through personal\r\nselection, for these must be contained in a majority of the ids.\r\n\r\nBut there is still another reason why indifferent characters should\r\nbecome stable, and that is the effect of general variational influences\r\non all the individuals of a species, as, for instance, in many climatic\r\nvarieties, and probably also in many cultivated varieties.\r\n\r\nBut even when we have fully recognized that, from the arcana of the\r\ngerm-plasm, new minimal variations are continually cropping up, which\r\nare biologically indifferent, and nevertheless become variational\r\ntendencies, and may increase even to the extent of causing _visible_\r\ndifferences, and that therefore varieties of snails or of butterflies,\r\nor of any animal or plant whatever, may originate through germinal\r\nselection alone, it cannot for a moment be supposed that the\r\ntransmutation of species depends upon this process exclusively or even\r\npreponderantly. This was Nägeli's mistake, and that of his followers as\r\nwell, that he ascribed to his 'principle of perfecting' the essential\r\nrôle in directing the whole movement of evolution, while the general\r\nstructure of all species shows us that they are, so to speak, built\r\nup of adaptations. But adaptations could not be--or could only be\r\nfortuitously and exceptionally--the _direct_ result of an internal\r\npower of development, since the very essence of adaptational changes is\r\nthat they are variations which bring the organism into harmony with the\r\nconditions of its life. We are therefore forced either to underestimate\r\ngreatly the part played by adaptation in every organism--and that\r\nis what Nägeli did--or to leave the standpoint of natural science\r\naltogether, and assume a transcendental force which varied and\r\nadapted the species of organisms _pari passu_ with the changes in the\r\nconditions of life during the geological evolution of our earth. This\r\nwould be a sort of pre-established harmony, through which the two\r\nclocks of evolution--that of the earth and that of organisms--kept\r\nexact time, although they had quite different and independent works!\r\n\r\nBut that the determining significance of adaptations in organic forms\r\nis underestimated even now is evidenced by the continually repeated\r\nstatement that species differ, not in their adaptive characters, but in\r\npurely morphological characters, whereas it is obvious that we are far\r\nfrom being able to estimate the functions of a part with sufficient\r\nprecision to be able to say definitely whether the differences between\r\ntwo nearly allied species are or are not adaptations to different\r\nconditions. The same is true with regard to the other side of the\r\nproblem--the conditions of life. These are often to all appearances\r\nidentical in two allied species, but even where they are visibly\r\ndifferent it is often difficult to assert that the differences between\r\nthe two species can be interpreted with certainty as adaptations to\r\nthe specific conditions of life. At an earlier stage we discussed\r\nthe protective coloration of butterflies, and we saw that the forest\r\nbutterflies of the Tropics frequently mimicked a dry leaf on their\r\nunder surfaces. In the various regions of the extensive forest\r\ndistricts of the Orinoco and the Amazon in South America there are\r\nfifty species of the genus _Anæa_ alone, and in the resting pose all\r\nthese bear a most deceptive resemblance to a leaf, yet each of them\r\ndiffers from the rest in the mingling of its colours, its brilliance,\r\nand usually in markings when these are present. If we wished to be able\r\nto decide whether these specific differences were of an adaptive nature\r\nor not, we should first of all require to know in what kind of forest\r\ntwo neighbouring species lived, and in what places, among what sort\r\nof leaves, they were in the habit of settling. Even then we should at\r\nbest only know whether the species _A_ was better protected, as far as\r\nour own eyes were concerned, among the leaves of the forest _A´_ than\r\nthe species _B_, and conversely; but we could not tell whether they\r\n_required_ this protection, or whether the species _A_, if transferred\r\nto the forest _B´_, would be more frequently discovered and destroyed\r\nby its enemies than in its own forest-home, and that alone could\r\nprove the difference to be biologically important, that is, to have\r\nselection-value. The difficulty, indeed the impossibility, of arriving\r\nat such decisions can perhaps be better illustrated by an example from\r\nour indigenous fauna. No one doubts that the upper surface of the\r\nanterior wing in the so-called banner-moth (_Catocala_) possesses a\r\nvery effective protective colouring; by day the moths rest with wings\r\nspread out flat upon tree trunks, wooden fences, walls, &c., and they\r\nare so excellently suited to their environment that they are usually\r\noverlooked both by man and animals. But each of the twelve German\r\nspecies of _Catocala_ has a special protective colouring; in _Catocala\r\nfraxini_ it is a light grey, in _Catocala nupta_, a dark ash-grey, in\r\n_Catocala elocata_ rather a yellowish-brown grey, in _Catocala sponsa_\r\nan olive brown, in _Catocala promissa_ a mingling of whitish-grey\r\nand olive brown, and so on. All these colourings are protective; but\r\ncould any even of our most experienced and sharp-sighted entomologists\r\nprove that each of these different shades of colour depends upon\r\nadaptation to the usual resting-place of the particular species to\r\nwhich it belongs? And yet it is on _a priori_ grounds highly probable\r\nthat this is the case. But even this would by no means dispose of the\r\nwhole problem, for each of these protective colour schemes is composed\r\nof several, often many, tints; it must be so if they are to fulfil\r\ntheir end at all, for a uniformly coloured wing would contrast with\r\nthe bark of every tree and with every wooden fence. The wing-surface\r\nmust therefore bear on a lighter background a number of lines and\r\nstreaks varying from brown to black, and usually running zigzag across\r\nthe wing; beside these are spots of lighter colour, which complete\r\nthe deceptive picture. This 'marking' of the wing is similar in all\r\ntwelve species, and yet in each it is different in detail. It is\r\nconstant in each, and thus is a specific character. But who would\r\nventure to undertake the task of proving that each of these streaks,\r\nspots, zigzag lines, &c., is or is not adaptive--that the details are\r\nnecessary adaptations to the resting-place which had become habitual\r\nto the species, or, on the other hand, simply expressions of the\r\nvariational tendencies of the elements of marking, depending upon\r\ngerminal selection? This would be an impossible task, and yet we are\r\nhere dealing with a character which, _as a whole_, is undoubtedly\r\nadaptive; in many of the differences between other species even that is\r\nnot certain.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, therefore, hardly reasonable to talk of the\r\n'insufficiency of natural selection' because we are not able to\r\ndemonstrate that the minutiæ of specific characters are adaptational\r\nresults. Personal selection intervenes whenever the variations produced\r\nby germinal selection attain to selection-value; and whether we can\r\ndetermine the exact point at which this takes place in individual cases\r\nis, as I have said before, theoretically quite indifferent.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there are cases in which we _can_ prove that specific\r\ndifferences are of an adaptive nature. When, of two nearly related\r\nspecies of frog, the spermatozoon of one possesses a thick head and\r\nthat of the other a thin head, and when at the same time the micropyle\r\nthrough which alone the spermatozoon can make its way into the ovum is\r\nwide in the first species and narrow in the second, we have before us a\r\nspecific character which is obviously adaptive.\r\n\r\nIn order to gain clearness as to the significance of natural selection\r\nin the restricted sense, that is of personal selection, it seems to\r\nme much more important to study the different groups of animals and\r\nplants with special reference to what they undoubtedly exhibit in the\r\nway of adaptation. For that reason I discussed different groups of\r\nadaptations in detail in some of the preceding lectures, although, or\r\nrather because, they all teach us that every part of every species,\r\nwhether animal or plant, even every secretion, and indeed every habit,\r\nevery inherited instinct, is subject to adaptation to the conditions of\r\nlife. It seems difficult to refuse to admit that this is the natural\r\nimpression which this study conveys, and it is strengthened as our\r\nknowledge increases; _that every essential part of a species is not\r\nmerely regulated by natural selection, but is originally produced\r\nby it_, if not in the species under consideration at the time, then\r\nin some ancestral species; and, further, that every part can adjust\r\nitself in a high degree to the need for adaptation. It was not without\r\na purpose that I discussed the phenomenon of mimicry so fully, for\r\nit, above all others, teaches us how great a power of adaptation the\r\norganism possesses, and what insignificant and small parts may be\r\ntransformed, in a remarkable degree, in accordance with some actual\r\nneed. We saw that a butterfly might assume a colouring which diverged\r\nentirely from that of its nearest relatives, but which caused it to\r\nresemble an immune species of a different family, and thereby protected\r\nit more effectively from persecution. Such a case can no more be due to\r\na dominating phyletic force than to a chance and sudden displacement\r\nof the state of equilibrium of the determinant system; it can depend\r\nonly on natural selection, that is, on a sifting out of the diverse\r\nvariations offered by germinal selection, and the unhampered expression\r\nand augmentation of those favoured.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only these minute variations, insignificant in relation\r\nto the whole structure of the animal, which can be determined by\r\nnatural selection. The same applies to the phyletic evolution as a\r\nwhole; even that is not directed by the assumed internal principle of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nAdaptations, from their very nature, can only depend upon selection,\r\nand not upon an internal principle of evolution, since that could\r\ntake no account whatever of external circumstances, but would cause\r\nvariations in the organism altogether independently of these. Thus, in\r\nconsidering the origin of any of the larger groups of animals, we may\r\nexclude a phyletic power as the guide of its evolution as soon as we\r\ncan prove that all its essential structural relations, as far as they\r\ndiverge from those of nearly related groups, are adaptations. We may\r\nnot be able to do this for nearly all of the animal groups, and it will\r\nhardly be possible in regard to a single group of plants, because our\r\ninsight into the _biological_ significance of characters, which means\r\nmore than the functional significance of the individual parts, and\r\ntheir correlation as parts of a whole, is seldom sufficiently intimate\r\nor thorough. But among animals we can do this in regard to some groups;\r\none of these is the order of whales or Cetaceans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.

After Claus.]\r\n\r\nCetaceans, as is well known, belong to the Mammalia, that is to\r\nsay, to a class whose structure was built for life on the land. The\r\nancestors of Cetaceans were similar to the other mammals, and possessed\r\na coat of hair and four legs, and a body the mass of which was so\r\ndistributed that it could be borne by those four legs. But all the\r\nmodern Cetaceans live in the sea, and they have therefore entirely\r\nchanged their bodily form; they have become spindle-shaped like fishes,\r\nwell adapted for cleaving the water, but incapable of moving upon land.\r\nAt the same time, their hind-legs have completely disappeared, and can\r\nnow be demonstrated only as rudiments within the mass of muscle (Fig.\r\n130, _Br_, _Tr_, _Fr_), while the fore-legs have been transformed\r\ninto flippers, in which, however, the whole inherited, but greatly\r\nshortened, skeleton of the mammalian arm is concealed (_OA_, _UA_,\r\n_H_). The skin has lost its covering of hair so completely that in\r\nsome cases no traces of it are demonstrable except in the embryo. All\r\nthese changes are adaptations to an aquatic life, and could not have\r\nbeen produced independently of the influence of external conditions.\r\nBut there is much more than this. A thick layer of blubber under the\r\nskin gives this warm-blooded animal an effective protection against\r\nbeing cooled down by the surrounding water, and at the same time gives\r\nit the appropriate specific gravity for life in the sea; an enormous\r\ntail-fin similar to that of fishes, but placed horizontally, forms the\r\nchief organ of locomotion, and for this reason the hind-legs became\r\nsuperfluous and degenerated. Similarly, the muscles of the ear have\r\nalso disappeared, for the hearing organ of this aquatic type is no\r\nlonger suited for receiving the sound-waves through an air-containing\r\ntrumpet, but receives them by a shorter route from the surrounding\r\nwater, directly through the bones of the skull. Remarkable changes\r\nin the respiratory and circulatory organs make prolonged submersion\r\npossible, and the displacement of the external nares from the snout to\r\nthe forehead enables the animal to draw breath when it comes up from\r\nthe depths to a frequently stormy surface. It would take a long time to\r\nenumerate all that can be recognized as adaptive in these remarkable\r\naquatic mammals to a life in what to their ancestors would have been a\r\nstrange and hostile element. Let us study particularly the case of the\r\nwhalebone whales, for instance the Greenland whale, and we are at once\r\nstruck by the enormous size of the head, which makes up about a third\r\nof the whole body (Fig. 130). Can this, which has such an important\r\neffect in determining the whole type of animal, be an outcome of some\r\ninternal power of development? By no means! It is rather an adaptation\r\nto the mode of nutrition peculiar to this swimming mammal, for it\r\ndoes not, like dolphins and toothed whales, feed on large fishes and\r\nCephalopods, but on minute delicate molluscs--Pteropods and pelagic\r\nGastropods, on Salpæ, and the like, which often cover the surface\r\nof the Arctic Ocean in endless shoals, sometimes extending for many\r\nmiles. To enable the whale to sustain life on such minute morsels it\r\nwas necessary that it should be able to swallow enormous quantities;\r\nteeth were therefore useless, and they have become rudimentary, and can\r\nonly be demonstrated in the embryo as rudiments (dental germs) in the\r\njaw; but in place of these there hang from the roof of the mouth-cavity\r\ngreat plates of 'whalebone,' a quite peculiar product of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the mouth, the ends of which are frayed into fibres, and\r\nform a sieve-net for catching the little animals which are engulfed\r\nwith the sea-water. The mouth-cavity itself has become enormous, so\r\nthat great quantities of water at a time can be strained through the\r\nnet of whalebone-plates.\r\n\r\nWhen I mention that peculiar changes have occurred also in the internal\r\norgans, that the lungs have elongated longitudinally and thus enable\r\nthe animal more readily to lie in the water in a horizontal position,\r\nthat peculiar arrangements exist within the nostrils and the larynx\r\nwhich enable the animal to breathe and swallow simultaneously, and that\r\nthe diaphragm lies almost horizontally because of the length of the\r\nlung, I think I have said enough to indicate that not only does almost\r\neverything about the whale diverge from the usual mammalian type, but\r\nthat all these deviations are adaptations to an aquatic life. If\r\neverything that is characteristic, that is, typical either of the order\r\nor of the family to which animals belong, depends upon adaptation,\r\nwhat room is left for the activity of an internal power of evolution?\r\nHow much is left of the whale when the adaptations are subtracted?\r\nNothing more than the general scheme of a mammal; but this was implicit\r\nin their ancestors before the whales originated at all. But if what\r\nmakes whales what they are, that is, the whole 'scheme' of a whale,\r\nhas originated through adaptation, then the hypothetical evolutionary\r\npower--wherever its seat may be--has had no share in the origin of this\r\ngroup of animals.\r\n\r\nI said all this more than ten years ago, but the idea of an internal\r\ndirective evolutionary force is firmly rooted in many minds, and\r\nnew modifications of the idea are always cropping up, and of these\r\nthe most dangerous seem to me to be those which are not clear in\r\nthemselves, but suppose that the use of a shibboleth like 'organic\r\ngrowth' means anything. That organic growth is at the base of the\r\nphyletic evolution of organisms may be maintained from any scientific\r\nstandpoint whatsoever, from ours as well as from Nägeli's, for no one\r\nis so extreme and one-sided as to regard the process of evolution as\r\ndue _solely_ to internal or _solely_ to external factors. The process\r\nmay thus always be compared to the growth of a plant, which likewise\r\ndepends on both internal and external influences. But that is saying\r\nvery little; we have still to show how much and how little is effected\r\nby these internal and external factors, what their nature precisely\r\nis, and what relation they bear to one another. There is thus a great\r\ndifference between believing, with Nägeli, that 'the animal and plant\r\nkingdoms must have become very much what they actually are, even\r\nhad there been on the earth no adaptation to new conditions and no\r\ncompetition in the struggle for existence,' and sharply emphasizing, in\r\naccordance with the facts just discussed, that, in any case, a whole\r\norder of mammals--the Cetaceans--could never have arisen at all if\r\nthere had been no adaptation.\r\n\r\nThe same thing could be proved in regard to the class of Birds, for\r\nin them too we are able to recognize so many adaptive features, that\r\nwe may say everything about them that makes them birds depends upon\r\nadaptation to aerial life, from the articulations of the backbone\r\nto the structure of the skull and the existence of a bill; from the\r\ntransformation of the fore-limbs into wings, and of the hind-limbs\r\nto very original organs of locomotion on land or swimming organs in\r\nwater, to the structure of the bones, the position, size, and number\r\nof the internal organs, down even to the microscopic structure of\r\nnumerous tissues and parts. What could be more characteristic of a\r\nclass of animals than feathers are of birds? They alone are enough\r\nto distinguish the class from all other living classes; an animal\r\nwith feathers can now be nothing but a bird, and yet the feather is\r\na skin-structure which has arisen through adaptation, a reptilian\r\nscale which has been so transformed that an organ of flight could\r\ndevelop from its anterior extremity. We find it thus even in the two\r\nimpressions of the primitive bird _Archcæopteryx_, which have been\r\npreserved for us in the Solenhofen slate since the Jurassic period in\r\nthe history of the earth. And into what detail does adaptation go in\r\nthe case of the feathers! Is not the whole structure, with its quill,\r\nshaft, and vane, precisely adapted to its function, although that is\r\npurely passive? What I have just said of the whole class of Birds holds\r\ntrue for this individual structure, the feather; everything about it\r\nis adaptation, and indeed illustrates adaptation in two directions,\r\nfor in the first place the feathers, by spreading a broad, light,\r\nand yet resistant surface with which to beat the air, act as organs\r\nof flight, while they are also the most effective warmth-retaining\r\ncovering conceivable. In both these directions their achievements\r\nborder on the marvellous. I need only recall the most recent discovery\r\nin this domain, the proof recently given by the Viennese physiologist,\r\nSigmund Exner, that the feathers become positively electric in their\r\nsuperficial layer, and negatively electric in their deeper layer,\r\nwhenever they rub against one another and strike the air. But they\r\nare rubbed whenever the bird flies or moves, and the consequence\r\nof the contrast in the electric charging of the two layers is that\r\nthe covering feathers are closely apposed over the down-feathers,\r\nwhile, on the other hand, the similar charging of the down-feathers\r\nmakes them mutually repel each other, with the result that a layer\r\nof air is retained between them, and thus there is between the skin\r\nand the covering feathers a loose thicket of feathers uniformly\r\npenetrated by air--the most effective warmth-preserver imaginable.\r\nThe electric characters of the feathers--and the same is true of the\r\nhairs of animals--are thus not indifferent characters, but with an\r\nappreciable biological importance, and the same is true of the almost\r\nmicroscopical series of little hooklets which attach the barbs of the\r\ncovering feathers to one another, and thus form a relatively firm but\r\nexceedingly light wing-surface which offers a strong resistance to\r\nthe air. But as we must regard these hooklets as adaptations, so must\r\nwe also regard the electrical characters of the feathers, and we must\r\nthink of them as having arisen through natural selection, as Exner\r\nhimself has insisted.\r\n\r\nIf we are able to recognize all the more prominent features of\r\nthe organization in Cetaceans and Birds as due to adaptation, we\r\nmust conclude that, in the rest of the great groups of the animal\r\nkingdom, the main and essential parts of the structure are adaptations\r\nto the conditions of life, even although the relations between\r\nexternal circumstances and internal organization are not so readily\r\nrecognizable. For if there were an internal evolutionary force at all,\r\nwe should be able to recognize its operation in the origin of the races\r\nof Cetaceans and Birds; but if there be no such power, then even in\r\ncases where the conditions of life are not so conspicuously divergent\r\nas in Cetaceans and Birds, we must refer the typical structure of the\r\ngroup to adaptation. Thus everything about organisms depends upon\r\nadaptation, not only the main features of the organization, but the\r\nlittle details in as far as they possess selection-value; it is only\r\nwhat lies below this level that is determined by internal factors\r\nalone, by germinal selection; but this is not an imperative force in\r\nthe sense in which the term is used by Nägeli and his successors, for\r\nit is capable of being guided; it does not necessarily lead to an\r\ninvariable and predetermined goal, but it can be directed according to\r\ncircumstances into many different paths. But it is precisely this that\r\nconstitutes the main problem of the evolution theory--how development\r\ndue to internal causes can, at the same time, bring about adaptation to\r\nexternal circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis lecture had been transcribed so far, and was ready for the\r\npress, when I received the first volume of a new work by De Vries, in\r\nwhich that distinguished botanist develops new views in regard to the\r\ntransformation of species, based upon numerous experiments, carried on\r\nfor many years on the variation of plants. As not only his views, but\r\nthe interesting facts he sets forth, seem to contradict the conclusions\r\nas to the transmutation of organisms which I have been endeavouring to\r\nestablish, I cannot refrain from saying something on the subject.\r\n\r\nDe Vries does not believe that the transformation of species can\r\ndepend on the cumulative summation of minute 'individual' variations;\r\nhe distinguishes between 'variations' and 'mutations,' and attributes\r\nonly to the latter the power of changing the character of a species.\r\nHe regards the former as mere fluctuating deviations which may be\r\nincreased by artificial selection, and may even, with difficulty,\r\nif carefully and purely bred for a long period, be made use of to\r\ngive character to a new breed, but which play no part at all in the\r\nnatural course of phylogeny. As regards phylogeny, he maintains that\r\nonly 'mutations' have any influence, that is, the larger or smaller\r\nsaltatory variations which crop up suddenly and which have from the\r\nvery first a tendency to be purely transmitted, that is, to breed true.\r\n\r\nThe facts upon which these views are mainly based are observations\r\non and breeding experiments with a species of evening primrose\r\n(_Œnothera_) which was found in quantities on a fallow potato-field\r\nat Hilversum in Holland. It had been cultivated previously in a\r\nneighbouring garden, and had sown itself thence in the field. The\r\nnumerous specimens of this _Œnothera lamarckiana_ growing there were\r\nin a state of marked 'fluctuating' variability, but in addition there\r\ngrew among them two strongly divergent forms which must have arisen\r\nfrom the others, and which led De Vries to bring the parent stock\r\nunder cultivation, in the hope that it would yield new forms, in the\r\nBotanical Gardens at Amsterdam. This hope was fulfilled; in the second\r\ncultivated generation there were, among the 15,000 plants, ten which\r\nrepresented two divergent forms, and in the succeeding generations\r\nthese forms were repeated several times and in many cases, and five\r\nother new forms cropped up, most of them in several specimens and in\r\ndifferent generations of the original stock. All these new forms, which\r\nDe Vries calls 'elementary species,' breed true, that is to say, when\r\nthey are fertilized with their own pollen they yield seed which gives\r\nrise to the same 'elementary species.' The differences between the\r\nnew forms are usually manifold, and of the same kind as those between\r\nthe 'elementary' species of the wild Linnæan species. But, according\r\nto De Vries, what we have been accustomed since the time of Linné to\r\ncall a 'species' is a collective category, whose components are these\r\n'elementary' species which De Vries has observed in his experiments\r\nwith _Œnothera_. In other species, such as _Viola tricolor_ and _Draba\r\nverna_, true-breeding varieties have long been known to botanists, and\r\nthese have been studied carefully and tested experimentally, especially\r\nby A. Jordan, and more recently by De Bary.\r\n\r\nAll 'species,' according to the Linnæan conception, consist, De Vries\r\nmaintains, of a larger or smaller number (in _Draba_ there are two\r\nhundred) of these 'elementary' species, and these arise, as is proved\r\nby the case of _Œnothera_, by saltatory or discontinuous 'variations'\r\nwhich occur periodically and suddenly break up a species into many\r\nnew species, because the variations of the germ-plasm, which are for\r\na time merely latent, suddenly find expression in the descendants of\r\none individual or another. According to this view, species must be\r\nthe outcome of purely internal causes of development, which reveal\r\nthemselves as 'mutations,' that is as saltatory variations, which are\r\nstable and transmissible from the very first, and among which the\r\nstruggle for existence decides which shall survive and which shall\r\nbe eliminated. For the mutations themselves occur in no particular\r\ndirection; they are sometimes advantageous, sometimes indifferent,\r\nsometimes even injurious (for instance, when one sex is left out), and\r\nso it is always only a fraction of the mutations, often only a few,\r\nwhich prove themselves capable of permanent existence. Thus 'species do\r\nnot arise through the struggle for existence, but they are eliminated\r\nby it' (p. 150); natural selection does nothing more than weed out\r\nwhat is unfit for existence, it does not exercise any selective, in\r\nthe sense of directive, influence on the survivors. A difference in\r\nthe nature of variations was previously maintained by the American\r\npalæontologist Scott, though for different reasons and also with a\r\ndifferent meaning. He believed that variations in a definite direction\r\nwere necessary to explain the direct course of development which many\r\nanimal groups, such as the horses and the ruminants, have actually\r\nfollowed, and which he thought could not be ascribed to cumulative\r\nadaptation to the conditions of life. The 'mutations' of De Vries are\r\nnot distinguished from the 'fluctuating' variations by following a\r\ndefinite direction, but in that they are strictly heritable, that they\r\n'breed true.' It is true that 'fluctuating' individual differences are\r\nalso transmissible, and can be increased by artificial selection, but\r\nthey lack one thing that would make them component parts of a natural\r\nspecies, namely, constancy; they do not breed true, and are therefore\r\nnever independent of selection, but require to be continually selected\r\nout afresh in order that they may be kept pure. They form 'breeds,' not\r\nspecies, and if left to themselves they soon revert to the characters\r\nof the parent species, as is well known of the numerous 'ennobled\r\nraces' among our cereals. De Vries therefore denies absolutely that a\r\nnew species could be developed by natural selection from 'fluctuating'\r\nvariations, and not alone because there is no constancy of character,\r\nbut also because the capacity of the character for being increased is\r\nvery limited. Usually nothing more can be achieved than doubling of\r\nthe original character, and then progress becomes more difficult and\r\nfinally ceases altogether.\r\n\r\nThese are incisive conclusions, based upon an imposing array of weighty\r\nfacts. I readily admit that I have rarely read a scientific book\r\nwith as much interest as De Vries's _Mutationstheorie_. Nevertheless\r\nI believe that one might be carried away too far by De Vries, for\r\nhe obviously overestimates the value of his facts, interesting and\r\nimportant as these undoubtedly are, and under the influence of what\r\nis new he overlooks what lies before him--the other aspect of the\r\ntransmutation of species, to which the attention of most observers\r\nsince Darwin and Wallace has been almost exclusively devoted--I mean\r\nthe origin of adaptations. Not that he does not mention these, he\r\nassumes in regard to his mutations 'a selection working in a constant\r\ndirection,' and seeks to interpret them in terms of it, but as the\r\nmutations occur from purely internal reasons--I mean without any\r\nconnexion with the necessity for a new adaptation--and occur only\r\nin a small percentage of individuals, and in no definite direction,\r\nthey cannot possibly suffice to explain _adaptation_, which seems to\r\ndominate the whole organic world. But this is precisely the point at\r\nwhich many botanists cease to understand the zoologists, because among\r\nplants there are fewer adaptations than among animals; or, in any\r\ncase, adaptations in plants are not so readily demonstrated as among\r\nanimals, which not infrequently seem to us to be entirely built up of\r\nadaptations.\r\n\r\nIn this book, and in this chapter itself, I have discussed adaptations\r\nand their origin so much already that I need only refer to these pages\r\nfor convincing evidence that we cannot think of them as being brought\r\nabout by the accumulation and augmentation of individually occurring\r\nsaltatory 'mutations.' Not even if we assume that the leaps of mutation\r\ncan be increased in the course of generations; in short, even if we\r\nsay that mutations are all those variations which breed true and lead\r\nto the development of species, while variations are those which do\r\nnot. This would only be playing with words, so let us say that the\r\nfluctuating variations are really different in their nature, that is,\r\nin their causes, from mutations. De Vries lays great stress on the\r\nfact that these two kinds of variations must be sharply distinguished\r\nfrom one another, and this may have been useful or necessary for the\r\nfirst investigation of the facts before him, for we must first analyse\r\nand then recombine, but that variations and mutations are in reality\r\ndifferent in nature can assuredly not be assumed, since innumerable\r\nadaptations can only have arisen through the augmentation of individual\r\nvariations. These must therefore be able to become 'pure breeding,'\r\neven although they may not have done so in the cases of artificial\r\nselection which have hitherto been observed. How is it possible that\r\nchance mutations, in no particular direction, occurring only rarely and\r\nin a small percentage of individuals, can explain the origin of the\r\nleaf-marking of a _Kallima_ or an _Anæa_--the shifting of the original\r\nwing-nervures to form leaf-veins, and the exact correlation of these\r\nveins across the surfaces of both pairs of wings? And even if we were\r\nto admit that a mutation might have occurred which caused the veins of\r\nthe anterior and posterior wings to meet exactly by chance, that would\r\nstill not be a leaf-adaptation, for there would still be wanting the\r\ninstinct which compels the butterfly, when it settles down, to hold\r\nthe wings in such a position that the two pictures on the anterior\r\nand posterior wings fit into each other. Correlated mutations of the\r\nnervous system suited to this end are required, but that is too much to\r\nattribute to happy chance! The same holds true in regard to the whole\r\nleaf-picture on the two wings, for it could not possibly have arisen as\r\na whole by a sudden mutation. The whole litany of objections which have\r\nbeen urged throughout several decades against the Darwin-Wallace theory\r\nof natural selection, which were based on the improbability that chance\r\nvariations not in a definite direction should yield suitable material\r\nfor the necessary adaptations, may be urged much more strongly against\r\nmutations, which make their appearance in much smaller numbers and with\r\nless diversity.\r\n\r\nBut it is--as we have already seen--in regard to the necessity which\r\nexists almost everywhere for the co-adaptation of numerous variations\r\nof the most different parts, that the 'mutation theory' breaks down\r\nutterly. The kaleidoscopic picture, the mutation, is implicit from\r\nthe first, and must be accepted or rejected just as it is in the\r\nstruggle for existence; but harmonious adaptation requires a gradual,\r\nsimultaneous, or successive purposive variation of all the parts\r\nconcerned, and this can be secured only through the fluctuating\r\nvariations which are always occurring, and are increased by germinal\r\nselection and guided by personal selection.\r\n\r\nMany naturalists, and especially many botanists, regard adaptation\r\nas something secondary, something given to species by the way, to\r\nimprove the conditions of their existence, but not affecting their\r\nnature--comparable perhaps to the clothing worn by man to protect\r\nhimself from cold; but that is hardly the real state of the matter.\r\n\r\nThe deep-sea expedition conducted by Chun in 1898 and 1899 made many\r\ninteresting discoveries in regard to animals living in the depths of\r\nthe ocean, all of which exhibit peculiar adaptations to the special\r\nconditions of their life, and especially to the darkness of the great\r\ndepths. One of the most striking of these discoveries was that of\r\nthe luminous organs which are found not in all but in a great many\r\nanimals living on the bottom of the abyssal area, and also among the\r\nanimals occurring at various levels above the floor of the abyss.\r\nThese are sometimes glands which secrete a luminous substance, but\r\nsometimes complex organs, 'lanterns' which are controlled by the will\r\nof the animal, and suddenly evolve a beam of light and project it in\r\na particular direction, like an electric searchlight. These organs\r\nhave a most complex structure, composed of nerves and lenses, which\r\nfocus the light, and on the whole are not unlike eyes. That this sort\r\nof structure should have arisen all at once through a 'mutation' is\r\ninconceivable; it can have originated only from simple beginnings by a\r\ngradual increase of its structure along with continual strict selection\r\namong the variations which cropped up. They all depend upon complicated\r\n'harmonious' adaptation, and cannot possibly have been derived from\r\nmutations, that is, from ready-made structural 'constellations,' unless\r\nwe are to call in the aid of the miraculous. But lanterns of this kind\r\nare found in many different kinds of animals--in Schizopod Crustaceans,\r\nin shrimps, in fishes of different genera and families. Many fishes\r\nhave long rows of luminous organs on the sides and on the belly, and\r\nthese probably serve to light up the sea-floor and facilitate the\r\nfinding of food; in others the luminous organs are placed upon the\r\nsnout just above the wide voracious mouth, and in that position they\r\nhave undoubtedly the significance attributed to them by Chun, namely,\r\nthat they attract small animals, just as the electric lamps allure all\r\nsorts of nocturnal animals, and especially insects, in large numbers\r\nto their destruction. But not fishes only, but molluscs, e.g. the\r\nCephalopods of the great depths, have developed luminous organs, and\r\none species of Cephalopod has about twenty large luminous organs, like\r\ngleaming jewels, ultramarine, ruby-red, sky-blue and silvery, while\r\nin another the whole surface of the belly is dotted over with little\r\npearl-like luminous organs. Even if we cannot be quite clear as to the\r\nspecial use of these lanterns of deep-sea animals, there can be no\r\ndoubt that they are adaptations to the darkness of the great depths,\r\nand when we find the _same_ adaptations (in a physiological sense)\r\nin many animals belonging to the most diverse groups, there is no\r\npossibility of referring them to sudden mutations which have arisen\r\nall at once in these groups with no relation to utility, and yet have\r\nnot occurred in any animals living in the light. Only 'variations'\r\nprogressing and combining in the direction of utility can give us the\r\nkey to an explanation of the origin of such structures.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the eyes of deep-sea animals. It was believed at\r\none time that all the inhabitants of dark regions had lost their eyes.\r\nThis is the case with many cave animals and the inhabitants of the\r\nlightless depths of our lakes, but in the abyssal zone of the sea it\r\nis only some fishes and Crustaceans whose eyes have degenerated to\r\nthe vanishing point. Moreover, the disappearance apparently occurs in\r\nspecies which are restricted to the ocean-floor in their search for\r\nfood, which therefore can make more use of their tactile organs than of\r\ntheir eyes, for while the ocean-floor undoubtedly contains over wide\r\nareas an abundance of food for these mud-eaters, it is only partly\r\nilluminated, that is, only in places where there are luminous animals\r\nsuch as polyp-colonies, &c. The fact that so many of the animals of the\r\ngreat depths are luminous obviously conditions, not that most of the\r\nimmigrants into the abyssal zone should lose their eyes as useless,\r\nbut that they should adapt them to the light which is very weak in\r\ncomparison with that of the superficial layers. The eyes of deep-sea\r\nfishes, for instance, are either enormously large, and therefore suited\r\nfor perceiving the faint light of the depths, or they have varied in\r\nanother and very characteristic manner: they have become elongated\r\ninto a cylinder, which projects far beyond the level of the head. It\r\nlooks almost as if the animals were looking through an opera-glass, and\r\nChun has called these eyes 'telescope-eyes.' A. Brauer has recently\r\nshown what far-reaching variations of the original eye of fishes were\r\nnecessary in order to transform it into an organ for seeing in the\r\ndark. These variations, however, have occurred in the eyes of the most\r\ndiverse animals in the deep sea, and not only do different families\r\nof deep-sea fishes possess 'telescope-eyes,' but Crustaceans and\r\nCephalopods as well. Even our owls possess quite a similar structure,\r\nalthough it does not project beyond the head in the same way. Here\r\nagain we have to deal with the phenomenon which Oscar Schmidt in\r\nhis time called _convergence_, that is, corresponding adaptations\r\nto similar conditions in animal forms not genealogically connected\r\nwith one another. These telescope-eyes are not all descended from\r\none species which chanced in one of the 'mutation-periods' suddenly\r\nto produce this combination of harmonious adaptations, but they have\r\nrisen independently through variation progressing step by step in\r\nthe direction of the required end, that is to say, through natural\r\nselection based upon germinal selection. Only thus can their origin be\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nBut what is time of eyes adapted to darkness is true in some measure\r\nof all eyes, for the eyes of animals are not mere decorative points\r\nwhich might be present or absent; they cannot have arisen in any\r\nanimal whatever through sudden mutation--they have been laboriously\r\nacquired with difficulty, by the slow increase of gradually perfecting\r\nadaptations; they are parts which bear the most precise internal\r\ncorrelation with the whole organization of the animal, and which can\r\nonly cease to exist when they become superfluous. Thus the origin of\r\neyes seems to me only conceivable on the basis of germinal selection\r\ncontrolled towards what is purposeful by natural selection, that is to\r\nsay, on a basis of fluctuating variation, and not through chance.\r\n\r\nThis is the case with all adaptations. Just as the eyes of animals\r\nare adaptations which utilize the light-waves in the interest of the\r\norganism and its survival, the same is true of all the sense-organs,\r\ntactile organs, smelling and tracking organs, organs of hearing, and so\r\non. The animal cannot do without these; first the lower sense-organs\r\narose and then the higher; the increasingly high organization of the\r\nanimal conditioned this, and a multicellular animal without sensory\r\nstructures is inconceivable. The same may be said of the nervous system\r\nas a whole, whose function it is to translate into action the stimuli\r\nreceived through the sense-organs, whether directly or by means of\r\nintervening nerve-cells, which form central organs of ever-increasing\r\ncomplexity of composition. As telescope-eyes have evolved in some\r\ngroups of deep-sea animals, independently of one another, and certainly\r\nnot through the fortuitous occurrence of a mutation, but under the\r\ncompulsion of necessity in competition, so all the organs we have just\r\nnamed, the whole nervous system with all its sense-organs, must have\r\narisen through the same factors of evolution in numerous independent\r\ngenealogical lines. And it must not be supposed that this is all; what\r\nis true of the sense-organs--that they are necessities--is undoubtedly\r\ntrue also of all parts and organs of the animal body, both as a whole\r\nand in every detail. It cannot be demonstrated in all cases, but it\r\nis nevertheless certain that this applies also to all the organs of\r\nmovement, digestion, and reproduction, to all animal groups and also\r\nto the differences between them, even although these may not always be\r\nobvious adaptations to the conditions of life. What part is left for\r\nmutation to play if almost everything is an adaptation? Possibly the\r\nspecific differences; and these in point of fact cannot in many cases\r\nbe interpreted with certainty as adaptations, though this can hardly\r\nbe taken as a proof that they are not. Possibly also the geometrical\r\nskeletons of many unicellulars, in which again we cannot recognize any\r\ndefinite relation to the mode of life. It is easy enough to conceive\r\nof the wondrously regular and often very complex siliceous skeleton\r\nof the Radiolarians or Diatoms as due to saltatory mutations, and\r\n'leaps' of considerable magnitude must certainly have been necessary\r\nto produce some of the manifold transformations here as everywhere\r\nelse. But whether these are or are not without importance for the\r\nlife of the organisms, we are in the meantime quite unable to decide.\r\nHere too it is well to be cautious in concluding that these organic\r\n'crystallizations' are without importance, and therefore to infer that\r\nthey have arisen suddenly from purely internal causes. One of the\r\nexperts on Diatoms, F. Schütt, has shown us that differences in length\r\nin the skeletal process of the Peridineæ have a definite relation to\r\ntheir power of floating in the sea-water, that the long skeletal arms\r\nor horns which these microscopic vegetable organisms extend into the\r\nsurrounding water form a float-apparatus, for their friction against\r\nthe particles of the water prevents sinking and enables them to\r\nfloat for a considerable time at approximately the same level. These\r\nskeletal forms are thus adaptations, and Chun has recently been able to\r\ncorroborate the conclusion that this adaptation is exactly regulated,\r\nfor the length of these horns varies with the specific gravity of\r\nthe different ocean-currents, species with 'monstrously long' horns\r\noccurring, for instance, in the Gulf of Guinea, which is distinguished\r\nby its low salinity and high temperature (Fig. 131, _A_), while in\r\nthe equatorial currents with higher salinity and cooler water, and\r\nthus a higher specific gravity, there is a predominance of species\r\nof Peridineæ with 'very short' processes and relatively undeveloped\r\nfloat-apparatus (Fig. 131, _B_). It could be seen clearly in the course\r\nof the voyage that the long-armed Peridineæ became more abundant as the\r\nship passed from the North Equatorial current into the Gulf of Guinea,\r\nand that by and by they held the field altogether, but later, when the\r\n'Valdivia' entered into the South Equatorial current, they disappeared\r\n'all at once.' Thus in this case, in which the veil over the relations\r\nbetween form and function in unicellular organisms has been lifted a\r\nlittle, we recognize that the smallest parts of the cell-body obey\r\nthe laws of adaptation, and consistent thinking must lead us to the\r\nconviction that even in the most lowly organisms the whole structure in\r\nall its essential features depends upon adaptation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131. Peridineæ: species of _Ceratium_. _A_, from\r\nthe Gulf of Guinea. _B_, from the South Equatorial currents. After\r\nChun.]\r\n\r\nIf the horns of the Peridineæ grow to twelve times the usual length\r\nin adaptation to life in sea-water with a salinity increased to the\r\nextent of .002 per cent., then undoubtedly not only the protoplasmic\r\nparticles of the body which form the horns, but all the rest as well,\r\nmay be capable of adaptation; and if the _Peridinium_ protoplasm has\r\nthis power of adapting itself to the external conditions, then the\r\ncapacity for adaptation must be a general character of all unicellular\r\norganisms, or rather of all living substance. As will be seen later\r\non, we shall be brought to the same conclusion by different lines of\r\nevidence. But a recognition of this must greatly restrict the sphere of\r\noperation which we can attribute to saltatory mutations in the sense\r\nin which the term is used by De Vries, for adaptations from their very\r\nnature cannot arise suddenly, but must originate gradually and step by\r\nstep, from 'variations' which combine with one another in a definite\r\ndirection under the influence of the indirect, that is, selective\r\ninfluence of the conditions.\r\n\r\nAccording to the theory of De Vries it seems as if 'variations,'\r\naugmented by selection, could never become constant, and that even the\r\ndegree to which they can be augmented is very limited. As far as this\r\nlast point is concerned, De Vries seems to me to overlook the fact\r\nthat every increase in a character must have limits set by the harmony\r\nof the parts, which cannot be exceeded unless other parts are being\r\nvaried at the same time. Artificial selection, in fact, in many cases\r\nreaches a limit which it cannot pass, because it has no control over\r\nthe unknown other parts which ought to be varied, in order that the\r\ncharacter desired may be increased still further. Natural selection\r\nwould in many cases be able to accomplish this, provided that the\r\nvariation is useful. But of what use is it to the beetroot when its\r\nsugar-content is doubled, or to the Anderbeck oats to be highly prized\r\nby man? And yet many individual characters have been very considerably\r\nincreased in domesticated animals by selection: of these we need only\r\ncall to mind the Japanese cock with tail-feathers twelve feet long.\r\n\r\nBut undoubtedly these artificial variations do not usually 'breed true'\r\nin the sense that De Vries's mutations of _Œnothera lamarckiana_ did,\r\nthat is to say, they only transmit their characters in purity with the\r\ncontinual co-operation of artificial selection. This at least appears\r\nto be the case, according to De Vries, in the ennobled cereal races,\r\nwhich, if cultivated in quantities, rapidly degenerate. In many animal\r\nbreeds, however, this is not the case to the same degree; many, indeed\r\nthe majority, of the most distinct races of pigeon breed true, and only\r\ndegenerate when they are crossed with others.\r\n\r\nDe Vries regards it as a mistake to believe that artificial selection,\r\npersevered in for a long time, will succeed in producing a breed\r\nwhich will--as he expresses it--be independent of further selection\r\nand will maintain itself in purity. Experience cannot decide this, as\r\nwe have not command over the unlimited time necessary for selection,\r\nbut theoretically it is quite intelligible that a variation which had\r\narisen through selection would be more apt to breed true the longer\r\nselection was practised, and there is nothing to prevent it becoming\r\nultimately quite as constant as a natural species. For, at the\r\nbeginning of breeding, we must assume that the variation is contained\r\nin only a small number of ids; as the number of generations mounts up,\r\nmore and more numerous ids with this variation will go to make up the\r\ngerm-plasm, and the more the breed-ids preponderate the less likelihood\r\nwill there be that a reversion to the parent-form will be brought about\r\nby the chances of reducing-division and amphimixis. That most if not\r\nall breeds of pigeon still contain ids of the ancestral form in the\r\ngerm-plasm, although probably only a small number of them, we see from\r\nthe occasional reversion to the rock-dove which occurs when species\r\nare repeatedly crossed, but that ancestral ids may also be contained\r\nin the germ-plasm of long-established natural species is shown by the\r\noccurrence of zebra-striping in horse-hybrids. We can understand why\r\nthese ancestral ids should not have been removed long ago from the\r\ngerm-plasm by natural selection, since they are not injurious and may\r\nremain, so to speak, undetected. It is only when they have an injurious\r\neffect by endangering the purity of the new species-type that they can\r\nand must be eliminated by natural selection, and this does not cease\r\nto operate, as the human breeder does, but continues without pause or\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\nI therefore regard it as a mistake on the part of De Vries to exclude\r\nfluctuating variation from a share in the transformation of organisms.\r\nIndeed, I believe that it plays the largest part, because adaptations\r\ncannot arise from mutations, or can only do so exceptionally, and\r\nbecause whole families, orders, and even classes are based on\r\nadaptations, especially as regards their chief characters. I need only\r\nrecall the various families of parasitic Crustaceans, the Cetaceans,\r\nthe birds, and the bats. None of these groups can have arisen through\r\nsaltatory, perhaps even retrogressive, 'mutation': they can only have\r\narisen through variation in a definite direction, which we can think of\r\nonly as due to the selection of the fluctuations of the determinants of\r\nthe germ-plasm which are continually presenting themselves.\r\n\r\nThe difference between 'fluctuating' variability and 'mutation' seems\r\nto me to lie in this: that the former has always its basis only in\r\na small majority of the ids of the germ-plasm, while the mutation\r\nmust be present in most of the ids if it is to be stably transmitted\r\nfrom the very first. How that comes about we cannot tell, but we\r\nmay suppose that similar influences causing variation within the\r\ngerm-plasm may bring about variation of many ids in the same direction.\r\nI need only recall what I have already said as to the origin of\r\nsaltatory variations, such as the copper-beech and similar cases. The\r\nexperiments made by De Vries seem to me to give a weighty support to\r\nmy interpretation of these phenomena. De Vries himself distinguishes a\r\n'pre-mutation period,' just as I have assumed that the variations which\r\nspring suddenly into expression have been in course of preparation\r\nwithin the germ-plasm by means of germinal selection for a long time\r\nbeforehand. At first perhaps only in a few ids, but afterwards in\r\nmany, a new state of equilibrium of the determinant-system would be\r\nestablished, which would remain invisible until the chance of reducing\r\ndivision and amphimixis gave predominance to a decided majority of the\r\n'mutation-ids.' In the experiments made by De Vries the same seven new\r\n'species' were produced repeatedly and independently of one another in\r\ndifferent generations of _Œnothera lamarckiana_, and we thus see that\r\nthe same constellations (states of equilibrium) had developed in many\r\nspecimens of the parent plant, and that it depended on the proportion\r\nin which the ids containing these were represented in the seed whether\r\none or another of the new 'species' was produced.\r\n\r\nMy interpretation, according to which a larger or smaller number of\r\nids were the bearers of the new forms, receives further support from\r\nthe experiments, for the new species did not always breed true. Thus\r\nDe Vries found one species, _Œnothera scintillans_, which only yielded\r\n35-40 per cent. of heirs, or in another group about 70 per cent.; the\r\nother descendants belonged to the forms _lamarckiana_ or _oblonga_, but\r\nthe number of pure heirs could be increased by selection!\r\n\r\nI cannot devote sufficient space to go fully into these very\r\ninteresting experiments; but one point must still be referred to:\r\nthe parent form, _Œnothera lamarckiana_, was very variable from\r\nthe beginning, that is, it exhibited a high degree of fluctuating\r\nvariability. This tells in favour, on the one hand, of a deep-rooted\r\nconnexion between 'variation' and 'mutation,' and, on the other hand,\r\nit indicates that saltatory variation may be excited by transference\r\nto changed conditions of life--as Darwin in his day supposed, and as\r\nI have endeavoured to show in the foregoing discussion. De Vries\r\nassumes mutation-periods, I believe rightly; but they are not periods\r\nprescribed, so to speak, from within, as those who believe in a\r\n'phyletic force' must suppose; they are caused by the influences of the\r\nenvironment which affect the nutritive stream within the germ-plasm,\r\nand which, increasing latently, bring about in part mere variability,\r\nin part mutations, just as I have indicated in the section on Isolation\r\n(vol. ii. p. 280), and indeed, in one of my earliest contributions to\r\nthe theory of descent[30]. In that essay I suggested the conclusion\r\nthat periods of constancy alternate with periods of variability,\r\nbasing my opinion on general considerations, and on Hilgendorf's study\r\nof the Steinheim snail-shells. According to De Vries's _Œnothera_\r\nexperiments we may assume that periods of increased variability may\r\nlead to the marked variations sometimes affecting several characters\r\nsimultaneously, and occurring in many ids, which have hitherto been\r\ncalled 'saltatory' variations, and which we should perhaps do well to\r\ncall in future, with De Vries, _mutations_.\r\n\r\n[30] _Ueber den Einfluss der Isolirung auf die Artbildung_, Leipzig,\r\n1872, p. 51.\r\n\r\nWe cannot yet determine how far the influence of such mutations\r\nreaches. I think it is plain that De Vries himself overestimated it,\r\nbut how many of the species-types which we find to-day depend upon\r\nmere mutation can only be decided with any certainty after further\r\ninvestigations. For the present it is well to be clear as to the\r\nvalidity of the general conclusion, that all 'complex,' and especially\r\nall 'harmonious,' adaptation, must depend, not upon 'mutation,' but\r\nonly upon 'variation' guided by selection. As species are essentially\r\ncomplexes of adaptation, originating from a basis of previous complexes\r\nof adaptation, there remains, as far as I can see, only the small field\r\nof indifferent characters to be determined by mutations, unless indeed\r\nwe are to include under the term 'mutation' all variations which gain\r\nstability, but this would be merely a play upon words. In my opinion\r\n_there is no definable boundary line between variation and mutation,\r\nand the difference between these two phenomena depends solely on\r\nthe number--larger or smaller--of ids which have varied in the same\r\ndirection_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXXIV\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE SPECIFIC TYPE (_continued_)\r\n\r\n Illustration of phyletic evolution by an analogy--Reconciliation\r\n of Nägeli and Darwin--Unity of the specific type furthered by\r\n climatic variation--By natural selection: illustration from aquatic\r\n animals--Direct path of evolution--Natural selection works in\r\n association with amphigony--Influence of isolation in defining the\r\n specific type--Duration of the periods of constancy--The Siberian\r\n pine-jays--Species are, so to speak, 'variable crystals'--Gradual\r\n increase of constancy and decrease of reversions--Physiological\r\n segregation of species through mutual sterility--Romanes's\r\n physiological selection--Breeds of domestic animals mutually fertile,\r\n presumably therefore 'amiktic' species also--Mutual fertility\r\n in plant species--Mutual sterility certainly not a condition of\r\n the splitting up of species--Splitting up of species without\r\n amphigony--Lichens--Splitting up of species apart from isolation and\r\n mutual sterility, _Lepus variabilis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur train of thought in the last lecture brought us back again to the\r\nso-called 'indifferent' characters, whose occurrence is so often used\r\nas evidence against natural selection, as a proof that evolution is\r\nguided essentially by internal forces alone. But this objection was\r\nbased on a fallacy, for the fact that the first small variations are\r\ndue to internal processes in the germ-plasm does not imply that the\r\nwhole further course of evolution is determined by these alone, any\r\nmore than the fact that a sleigh requires a push to start it on its\r\ndescent down an inclined plane would imply that its rapid descent is\r\ndue only to the force of the push, and not at the same time to the\r\nattraction of gravity. But the analogy is not quite sound, for the\r\nprocesses within the germ-plasm which condition and direct variation\r\ndo not merely give them the first shove off; they are associated with\r\nevery onward step in the evolutionary path of the species, they impel\r\nit further and further, and without these continual impulses the\r\nprogressive movement would cease altogether. We have seen that, for\r\ninternal reasons, germinal selection continues to impel the varying\r\ndeterminants further along the path on which they have started, and\r\nthus gives them cumulative strength, and that it is in this way that\r\nadaptations to the conditions of life are brought about. The evolution\r\nof the character of a species may thus be compared to the course of\r\na sleigh upon a level snow-surface which it could traverse in any\r\ndirection, but it is moved only by the impulses received through\r\ngerminal selection. The conditions of life to which the varying parts\r\nhave to adapt themselves may be thought of as the distant goal, and\r\nthe processes in the germ-plasm which give rise to variation in a\r\ndefinite direction may be compared to numerous human beings scattered\r\nirregularly over the surface of the snow. If the sleigh receives from\r\none of these a push which chances to be in the direction of the goal,\r\nit rushes on towards this and ultimately reaches it if the person\r\npushing continues to push in the same direction. So far, then, it\r\nseems as if the transformation of the part concerned depended upon\r\ngerminal selection alone, but we must not forget that the germ-plasm\r\ndoes not contain only one determinant for every part of the body, but\r\nas many determinants as there are ids. We must therefore increase the\r\nnumber of our sleighs, and now it is obvious that the pushers of the\r\nsleighs, that is, germinal selection, may push one sleigh on toward\r\nthe goal, but others in the opposite or in any other direction. If we\r\nassume that all the sleighs which have taken a wrong direction must\r\nreach dangerous ground, and ultimately plunge into an abyss, but that\r\nfrom a neighbouring point sleighs were being dispatched to replace all\r\nthat came to grief, that these in their turn might attempt to reach\r\nthe goal, it would ultimately come about that the requisite number\r\nof sleighs would arrive at the goal--that is to say, that the new\r\nadaptation would be attained.\r\n\r\nThe abysses represent the elimination of the less favourable\r\nvariational tendencies, and the constant replacing of sleighs\r\nrepresents the intermingling of fresh ids through amphimixis. If all\r\nthe sleighs run in the wrong direction they all come to grief, that\r\nis, the individual concerned is eliminated with all the ids of its\r\ngerm-plasm--it disappears altogether from the ranks of the species. But\r\nif only a portion of them run in the right direction, care is taken\r\nthat in following generations, that is, in the continuation of the\r\nsleigh-race, this portion combines with those of another group which\r\nare also running in the right direction--that is, with the half number\r\nof ids from another germ-plasm in amphimixis.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to follow the analogy further, but perhaps it may\r\nserve to illustrate how germinal selection may be the only impelling\r\nforce in the organisms, and yet only a small part of its results\r\nare determined by itself, and by far the larger part by external\r\nconditions. We understand how a variation in a definite direction can\r\nexist, and yet it is not that which creates species, genera, orders,\r\nand classes; it is the selection and combination of the variational\r\ntendencies by the conditions of life, which occurs at every step.\r\nThere was no variational tendency leading from terrestrial mammals to\r\nCetaceans, but there was a variational tendency moving the nostrils\r\nupwards towards the forehead, the hind-limbs towards diminution,\r\nthe lungs towards lengthening, the tail towards broadening out. But\r\neach of these variational tendencies was always only one of several\r\npossibilities, and that the particular path which led towards the\r\n'goal' was followed was due to the fact that the others plunged into\r\nthe abyss to which the wrong paths led, that is to say, they were\r\nweeded out by selection. Thus germinal selection offers a possibility\r\nof reconciliation between Nägeli's and Darwin's interpretations, which\r\nseem so directly contradictory; for the former referred everything to\r\nthe hypothesis of an internal evolutionary force, the latter rejected\r\nthis, and regarded natural selection as the main, if not the exclusive\r\nfactor in evolution. The internal struggles for food, which we have\r\nassumed as occurring in the germ-plasm, represent an internal force,\r\nthough not in the sense of Nägeli, who thought of determining influence\r\noperative from first to last, but still an impelling force, which\r\ndetermines the direction of variation for the individual determinants,\r\nand must therefore do the same for the whole evolution up to a certain\r\npoint; for it is only the _possible_ variations of the determinants in\r\na germ-plasm which can be chosen, selected, combined, and increased by\r\nnatural selection, and every germ-plasm cannot give rise to all sorts\r\nof variations; the determinants contained in it condition what is\r\npossible and what is not, and this is an important limitation to the\r\nefficacy of natural selection, and to a certain extent also implies a\r\nguiding and determining power on the part of the internal mainspring,\r\nto wit, _germinal selection_.\r\n\r\nThe essential difference between Darwin's view of the transformation\r\nof forms and my own lies in the fact that Darwin conceived of natural\r\nselection as working only with variations which are not only due to\r\nchance themselves, but the intensification of which also depends in\r\nits turn solely upon natural selection, while, according to my view,\r\nnatural selection works with variational tendencies which become\r\nintensified through internal causes, and are simply accumulated by\r\nnatural selection in an ever-growing majority of ids in a germ-plasm\r\nthrough the selection of individuals.\r\n\r\nThis affects our view of the establishment of a specific type in so\r\nfar that my intra-germinal variational tendencies are not necessarily,\r\nand not always due to chance, though they are so in most cases. If\r\ncertain determinants are impelled to vary in a particular direction\r\nthrough climatic or any other influences, as we have seen to be the\r\ncase, for instance, with the climatic varieties of many Lepidoptera,\r\nthen the corresponding determinants in all the individuals must vary in\r\nthe same direction, and thus all the individuals of the species which\r\nare subject to the same influence must undergo the same variation.\r\nTransformations of this kind have exactly the appearance of resulting\r\nfrom 'an internal evolutionary force,' such as Nägeli assumed, and the\r\nunity of the specific type will not be disturbed by them.\r\n\r\nNor will this occur, as far as I can see, if the transformation of\r\na species depends solely upon new adaptations and their internal\r\nconsequences, for if a particular organism has to adapt itself to\r\nspecial new conditions, it will usually be able to do so only in _one_\r\nway, and thus natural selection will always allow _the same_ suitable\r\nvariational tendencies to survive and reproduce, so that the unity\r\nof the specific type will not be permanently disturbed in this way\r\neither. The more advantageous the new conditions of life prove, and the\r\nmore diverse the ways in which they can be utilized, the more rapidly\r\nwill the species first adapted to them multiply, and the more will\r\ntheir descendants be impelled to adapt themselves specially to the\r\n_different_ possibilities of utilizing the new situation, and thus,\r\nfrom a parent species adapted in general to the new conditions, there\r\narise forms adapted to its more detailed possibilities. I must refer\r\nagain to the previous instance of the Cetaceans which originated from\r\nvegetarian littoral, or fluviatile mammals, and have evolved since the\r\nTriassic period into a very considerable number of species-groups.\r\nAll are alike in their _general_ adaptation, and these adaptations to\r\nthe conditions of life of aquatic animals--the fish-like form, the\r\nflippers, the peculiarities of the respiratory organs and the organs of\r\nhearing--when once acquired would not and could not be lost again; but\r\neach of the modern groups of whales has its particular sphere of life,\r\nwhich it effectively exploits by means of subordinate adaptations.\r\nThus there are the dolphins with their bill-like jaws and the two\r\nrows of conical teeth, their active temperament, rapid movements, and\r\ndiet of fish; and the whalebone whales with their enormous gape, the\r\nsieve-apparatus of whalebone-plates, and a diet of small molluscs and\r\nthe like. But each of these groups has split up into species, and if we\r\nagain regard the principle of adaptation as determining and directing\r\nevolution, we are no nearer being able to prove the assumption in\r\nregard to individual cases, for we know too little about the conditions\r\nof life to be able to demonstrate that the peculiarities of structure\r\nare actually adaptations to these. Theoretically, however, it is quite\r\neasy to suppose that adaptation to a particular sphere of life was\r\nthe guiding factor in their evolution, and if this be so--as we have\r\nalready proved that it is in regard to the two chief groups and the\r\nwhole class--then the harmony of the structure must be due solely to\r\nthe continued selection of the fittest. We require no further principle\r\nof explanation for the establishment of a specific type.\r\n\r\nThis 'type' is thus not reached by any indefinite varying of the parent\r\nform in all directions, but in general it is reached by the most direct\r\nand shortest way. The parent form must indeed have become to some\r\nextent fluctuating, since not only the variational tendencies 'aiming\r\nat the goal,' but others as well, must have emerged in the germ-plasm;\r\nbut gradually these others would occur less and less frequently, being\r\nalways weeded out afresh by selection, until the great majority of the\r\nindividuals would follow the same path of evolution, under the guidance\r\nof germinal selection, which continues to work in the direction that\r\nhas once been taken. After a short period of variation, which need not,\r\nof course, involve the whole organism, but may refer only to certain\r\nparts of it, a steady direct progress in the direction of the 'goal,'\r\nthat is, of perfect adaptation, will set in, as we have seen in the\r\ncase of the _Planorbis_ snails of Steinheim.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget, however, that natural selection works essentially\r\nupon a basis of sexual reproduction, which with its reduction of the\r\nids and its continually repeated mingling of germ-plasms, combines the\r\nexisting variational tendencies, and thus diffuses them more and more\r\nuniformly among the individuals of a whole area of occupation. Sexual\r\nreproduction, continual intermingling of the individuals selected\r\nfor breeding, is thus a very effective and important, if not an\r\nindispensable, factor in the evolution of the specific type.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only in the case of species transformations due to\r\nnew adaptations that sexual mingling operates; it does so also in\r\nthe case of variations due to purely intra-germinal causes. We have\r\nalready seen in discussing Isolation that isolated colonies may come\r\nto have a peculiar character somewhat different from that of the\r\nparent form, because they were dominated by some germinal variational\r\ntendency which occurred only rarely in the home of the parent form, and\r\ntherefore never found expression there. On the isolated area this would\r\nindeed be mingled with the rest of the existing germinal variational\r\ntendencies, but the result of this mingling would be different, and the\r\nfurther development of the tendency in question would probably not be\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\nWe need not wonder, therefore, that specific types occur in such\r\nvarying degrees of definiteness. If a species is distributed over\r\na wide connected territory, sporadically, not uniformly, it will\r\ndepend partly upon the mutual degree of isolation of the sporadic\r\nareas whether the individual colonies will exhibit the same specific\r\ntype or will diverge from one another. If the animal in question is\r\na slow-moving one like a snail, the intermingling from neighbouring\r\nsporadic colonies will be much slower than in the case of a resident\r\nbird such as a woodpecker. Many interesting results would undoubtedly\r\nbe gained if the numerous careful investigations into the geographical\r\ndistributions of species and their local races were studied with\r\nspecial reference to this point, and much light would undoubtedly\r\nbe thrown upon the evolution of the specific type. But it would be\r\nabsolutely necessary to study carefully all the biological relations\r\nof the animals concerned, to trace back the history of the species as\r\nfar as possible, and to decide the period of immigration, the mode and\r\ndirection of distribution, and so on.\r\n\r\nNothing shows more plainly the enormous duration of the period of\r\nconstancy in species than the wide distribution of the same specific\r\ntype on scattered areas or even over different areas absolutely\r\nisolated from one another. If, as we saw, the same diurnal butterflies\r\nlive in the Alps and the far North, they must have remained unvaried\r\nsince the Glacial period, for it was the close of that period that\r\nbrought them to their present habitats, and while other diurnal\r\nbutterflies now living on the Alps differ from their relatives in\r\nthe Arctic zone (Lapland, Siberia, and Labrador) in some unimportant\r\nspot or line, and must therefore have diverged from one another in\r\nthe course of the long period since the Glacial epoch, they have\r\ndone so only to a minimal degree, and in characters which possibly\r\ndepend solely upon germinal selection and can hardly be regarded as\r\nadaptations.\r\n\r\nI should like, however, to cite one of the few cases known to me in\r\nwhich a slight deviation from the specific type undoubtedly depending\r\nupon adaptation has occurred on an isolated region. The nut-jay\r\n(_Caryocatactes nucifraga_) lives not only upon our Alps and in the\r\nBlack Forest, but also in the forests of Siberia, and the birds there\r\ndiffer from those with us in small peculiarities of the bill, which\r\nis longer and thinner in them, shorter and more powerful in ours.\r\nOrnithologists associate this difference with the fact that in this\r\ncountry the birds feed chiefly on hard hazel nuts, which they break\r\nopen with their bill, and on acorns, beechmast, and, in the Alps,\r\non cembra-cones, while in Siberia, where there are no hazel nuts,\r\nthey feed chiefly upon the seeds of the Siberian cedar, which are\r\nconcealed deep down in the cones. Thus we find that in Siberia the\r\nbill is slender, and that the upper jaw protrudes awl-like beyond the\r\nlower, for about 2.5 mm., and probably serves chiefly to pick out the\r\ncedar nuts from behind the cone-scales. In the Alps the birds (var.\r\n_pachyrhynchus_) break up the whole cone of the cembra-pine with their\r\nthick, hard bill, and in the Upper Engadine, where the nut-jay is\r\nabundant, I have often seen the ground underneath the cembra-pines\r\ncovered with the débris of its meal. In addition to these differences\r\nbetween the two races, the Alpine form is stronger in build, the\r\nSiberian form is daintier; in the former the white terminal band on\r\nthe tail is narrow (about 18 mm.), in the Siberian form it is broader\r\n(about 27 mm.).\r\n\r\nSuch cases of variation of individual parts in different areas seem to\r\nme very important theoretically, because they furnish us with an answer\r\nto the view which represents the species as a 'life-crystal,' which\r\nmust be as it is or not at all, and which therefore cannot vary as\r\nregards its individual parts. The case of the nut-jay has the further\r\ninterest that it is one of the few in which we find the new adaptation\r\nof a single character without variation of most of the other characters.\r\n\r\nIt is only in an essentially different sense that we can compare the\r\nspecies, like any other vital unit, to a crystal, in so far as its\r\nparts are harmoniously related one to another, or, as I expressed\r\nmyself years ago, are in a state of equilibrium, which must be brought\r\nabout by means of intra-selection. This analogy, however, only applies\r\nto the actual adjustment of the parts to a whole, and not to their\r\ncasual adjustment. Species are variable crystals; the constancy of a\r\nspecies in all its parts must be regarded as something quite relative,\r\nwhich may vary at any time, and which is sure to vary at some time\r\nin the course of a long period. But the longer the adaptation of\r\na species to new conditions persists the more constant, _ceteris\r\nparibus_, and the more slowly variable will it become, and this for\r\ntwo reasons: first, because the determinants which are varying in a\r\nsuitable direction are being more and more strictly selected, more\r\nand more precisely adapted, and are thus becoming more like each\r\nother; and secondly, because, according to our theory, the homologous\r\ndeterminants of all the ids do not vary in the required direction, and\r\na portion of the unvaried ancestral ids is always carried on through\r\nthe course of the phylogeny, and only gradually set aside by the\r\nchances of reducing division. But the more completely these unvaried\r\nids are eliminated from the germ-plasm the less likely will they be\r\nto find expression in reversions or in impurities of the new specific\r\ncharacters. I may recall the reversions of the various breeds of\r\npigeons to the rock-dove, those of the white species of _Datura_ to the\r\nblue form, and the _Hipparion_-like three-toed horse of Julius Cæsar,\r\nand so on. The unvaried ancestral ids, which in these cases find only\r\nquite exceptional expression, will make the new 'specific character'\r\nfluctuating, as long as they are contained in the germ-plasm in\r\nconsiderable numbers, but they must become more and more infrequent in\r\nthe germ-plasm as successive generations are passed through the sieve\r\nof natural selection, and the oftener these germ-plasms, to which the\r\nchances of reducing division and amphimixis have assigned a majority\r\nof the old determinants, are expelled from the ranks of the species by\r\npersonal selection. The oftener this has occurred in a species the less\r\nfrequently will it recur, and the more constant, _ceteris paribus_,\r\nwill the 'type' of the species become.\r\n\r\nIf we add to this idea the fact that adaptations take place very\r\nslowly, and that every variation of the germ-plasm in an appropriate\r\ndirection has time to spread over countless hosts of individuals, we\r\ngain some idea of the way in which new adaptations gradually bring\r\nabout the evolution of a more and more sharply-defined specific type.\r\n\r\nSo far, however, we have only explained the morphological aspect of the\r\nproblem of the nature of species, but there is also a physiological\r\nside, and for a long time this played an important part in the\r\ndefinition of the conception of species. Until the time of Darwin it\r\nwas regarded as certain that species do not intermingle in the natural\r\nstate, and that, though they could be crossed in rare cases, the\r\nprogeny would be infertile.\r\n\r\nAlthough we now know that these statements are only relatively correct,\r\nand that in particular there are many higher plants which yield\r\nperfectly fertile hybrids, it is nevertheless a striking phenomenon\r\nthat among the higher animals, mammals, and birds the old law holds\r\ngood, and hybrids between two species are very rarely fertile. The two\r\nproducts of crossing between the horse and the ass, the mule and the\r\nhinny, are never fertile _inter se_, and very rarely with a member of\r\nthe parent stock.\r\n\r\nWe have to ask, therefore, what is the reason of this mutual sterility\r\nof species; whether it is a necessary outcome of the morphological\r\ndifferences between the species, or only a chance accessory phenomenon,\r\nor perhaps an absolutely necessary preliminary condition to the\r\nestablishment of species.\r\n\r\nThe last was the view held by Romanes. He believed that a species could\r\nonly divide into two when it was separated into isolated groups either\r\ngeographically or physiologically, that is, when sexual segregation\r\nin some form is established within the species, so that all the\r\nindividuals can no longer pair with one another, but groups arise which\r\nare mutually sterile. It is only subsequently, he maintained, that\r\nthese groups come to differ from one another in structure. To this\r\nhypothetical process he gave the name of 'physiological selection.'\r\nThis view depends--it seems to me--upon an underestimate of the power\r\nof natural selection. Romanes believed that when a species began to\r\nsplit up, even the adaptive variations would always disappear again\r\nbecause of the continual crossing, and that only geographical isolation\r\nor sexual alienation, that is, physiological selection, would be\r\nable to prevent this. But even the fact that there are dimorphic and\r\npolymorphic species proves sufficiently that adaptation to two or even\r\nseveral sets of conditions can go on on the same area. In many ants we\r\nfind many kinds of individuals--the two sexual forms, the workers, and\r\nthe soldiers, and these last are undoubtedly distinguished by adaptive\r\ncharacters which must be referred to selection. The same is true of\r\nthe caterpillars, whose coloration is adapted to their surroundings\r\nin two different ways. If the individuals of one and the same species\r\ncan be broken up into two or more different forms and combinations\r\nof adaptations, while they are mingling uninterruptedly with one\r\nanother, natural selection must undoubtedly be able, notwithstanding\r\nthe continual intermingling of divergent types, to discriminate between\r\nthem and to separate them sharply from one another. Assuredly then a\r\nspecies can not only exhibit uniform variation on a single area, but\r\nmay also split up into two without the aid of physiological selection.\r\nTheoretically it is indisputable that of two varieties which are\r\nboth equally well suited to the struggle for existence, a mixed form\r\narising through crossing may not be able to survive. Let us recall, for\r\ninstance, the caterpillars, of which some individuals are green and\r\nsome brown, and let us assume that the brown colour is as effective\r\na protection as the green, then the two forms would occur with equal\r\nfrequency; but though a mixed hybrid form which was adapted neither to\r\nthe green leaves nor to the brown might occasionally crop up, it would\r\nalways be eliminated. It would occur because the butterflies themselves\r\nare alike, whether they owe their origin to green caterpillars or to\r\nbrown, and thus at first, at least, all sexual combinations would be\r\nequally probable.\r\n\r\nI do not believe therefore in a 'physiological selection,' in Romanes's\r\nsense, as an indispensable preliminary condition to the splitting of\r\nspecies, but it is a different question whether the mutual sterility so\r\nfrequently observable between species has not conversely been produced\r\nby natural selection in order to facilitate the separation of incipient\r\nspecies. For there can be no doubt that the process of separating two\r\nnew forms, or even of separating one new form from an old one, would\r\nbe rendered materially easier if sexual antipathy or diminished\r\nfertility of the crossings could be established simultaneously with the\r\nother variations. This would be useful, since pure and well-defined\r\nvariations would be better adapted to their life-conditions than\r\nhybrids, and would become increasingly so in the course of generations.\r\nBut as soon as it is useful it must actually come about, if that is\r\npossible at all. It may be, however, as we have said before, that the\r\ntwo divergent forms depend merely upon quantitative variations of the\r\nalready existing characters; sexual attraction, whether it depends\r\nupon very delicate chemical substances, or on odours, or on mutual\r\ncomplementary tensions unknown to us, will always fluctuate upwards and\r\ndownwards, and plus or minus determinants, which lie at the root of\r\nthese unknown characters in the germ-plasm, must continually present\r\nthemselves and form the starting-point for selection-processes of a\r\ngerminal and personal kind, which may bring about sexual antipathy and\r\nmutual sterility between the varieties. I therefore consider Romanes's\r\nidea correct in so far that separation between species is in many cases\r\naccompanied by increasing sexual antipathy and mutual sterility. While\r\nRomanes supposed that 'natural selection could in no case have been\r\nthe cause' of the sterility, I believe, on the contrary, that it could\r\nonly have been produced by natural selection; it arises simply, as\r\nall adaptations do, through personal selection on a basis of germinal\r\nselection, and it is not a preliminary condition of the separation\r\nof species, but an adaptation for the purpose of making as pure and\r\nclean a separation as possible. It is obviously an advantage for both\r\nthe divergent tendencies of variation that they should intermingle\r\nas little as possible. This is corroborated by the fact that by no\r\nmeans all the marked divergences of species are accompanied by sexual\r\nalienation, and that the mutual sterility so frequently seen is not an\r\ninevitable accompaniment of differences in the rest of the organism.\r\n\r\nThat this is not the case is very clearly proved by our domesticated\r\nanimals. The differences in structure between the various breeds of\r\npigeon and poultry are very great, and breeds of dog also diverge\r\nfrom one another very markedly, especially in shape and size of body.\r\nYet all these are fertile with one another, and they yield fertile\r\noffspring. But they are products of artificial selection by man, and\r\nhe has no interest in making them mutually sterile, so that they have\r\nnot been selected with a view to sexual alienation, but in reference\r\nto the other characters. The segregation of animal species into\r\nseveral sub-species on the same area is probably usually accompanied\r\nby sexual antipathy, since in this case it would be useful although\r\nnot indispensable. But the matter is different in the case of the\r\ntransformation of a colony upon a geographically isolated region.\r\n'Amiktic' forms, such as _Vanessa ichnusa_ of Corsica, are hardly\r\nlikely to be sexually alienated from the parent form; we have here\r\nto do only with the preponderance of a fortuitous and biologically\r\nvalueless variation and its consequent elevation to the rank of a\r\nvariety. The new form was not an adaptation, but only a variation, and\r\nas it was of no use, it was not in a position to incite any process of\r\nselection favouring its advancement.\r\n\r\nBut even adaptive transformations on isolated regions from which the\r\nparent species is excluded are not likely to develop rapidly any sexual\r\nantipathy as regards the parent stock, and I should not be surprised if\r\nexperiments showed that there is perfect mutual fertility between, for\r\ninstance, many of the species of _Achatinella_ on the Sandwich Islands\r\nor of _Nanina_ on Celebes, or between the species of thrushes on the\r\ndifferent islands of the Galapagos Archipelago, or between these and\r\nthe ancestral species on the adjacent continent, if that species is\r\nstill in existence. For there was no reason why sexual antipathy to\r\nthe parent form should have developed in any of these adaptation forms\r\nwhich have arisen in isolation, and therefore it has probably not been\r\nevolved.\r\n\r\nThat our view of the mutual sterility between species, as an adaptation\r\nto the utility of precise species-limitation, is the correct one is\r\nevidenced not only by our domesticated races, but even more clearly by\r\nplants, in regard to which it is particularly plain that the sexual\r\nrelations between two species are adaptational. We have already seen\r\nin what a striking way the sensitiveness of the stigma of a flower is\r\nregulated in reference to pollen from the same plant, that some species\r\nare not fertilizable by their own pollen at all, that others yield very\r\nlittle seed when self-fertilization is effected, and that others again\r\nare quite fertile--as much so as with the pollen of another plant of\r\nthe same species. We regarded these gradations of sexual sensitiveness\r\nas adaptations to the perfectly or only moderately well-assured visits\r\nof insects, or to their entire absence. I wish to cite these cases as\r\nwell as the heterostylism of some flowers as evidence in support of\r\nthe conception of the mutual sterility of species which I have just\r\noutlined. But this only in passing. The point to which I chiefly wish\r\nto direct attention is the mutual fertility of many plant-species.\r\nIn lower as well as in higher plants fertile hybrids occur not\r\ninfrequently under natural conditions, and cultivated hybrids, such\r\nas the new _Medicago media_, a form made by mingling two species of\r\nclover, may go on reproducing with its own kind for a considerable\r\ntime. A number of Phanerogams yield fertile hybrids, and in Orchids\r\neven species of different genera have been crossed and have yielded\r\noffspring which was in some cases successfully crossed with a third\r\ngenus.\r\n\r\nIf these facts prove anything it is that the factors which determine\r\nthe mutual sterility of species are quite distinct from their\r\nmorphological differences, in other words, from the diagnostic\r\ncharacters of the specific type. For a long time the verdict on this\r\nmatter was too entirely based on observations made on animals, among\r\nwhich mutual sterility arises relatively easily, even where it was not\r\nintended (_sit venia verbo!_). Even the pairing, but still more the\r\nperiod of maturity, the relations of maturity in ovum and sperm, and\r\neven the most minute details in the structure of the sperm-cell, the\r\negg-shell, envelope, &c., have to be taken into account, and these may\r\nbring about mutual or, as Born has shown, one-sided sterility. We know,\r\nthrough the researches of Strasburger, that a great many Phanerogams,\r\nwhen pollinated artificially from widely separated species of different\r\ngenera and families, will at least allow the pollen-tube to penetrate\r\ndown to the ovule, and that in many cases amphimixis actually results.\r\nIt follows that we must not lay too great stress upon the mutual\r\nsterility which occurs almost without exception among the higher\r\nanimals, but must turn to the plants with greater confidence.\r\n\r\nAmong plants there is very widely distributed mutual fertility between\r\nspecies. I doubt, however, whether the observations on this point\r\nare sufficient to warrant any certain conclusion in regard to the\r\nimportance of the phenomena in the formation of species. At least it\r\nis not easy to see why the mutual sterility of many species of plants\r\nshould not have been necessary or useful in separating species, and why\r\nit was not therefore evolved. We may point to the fact that animals\r\ncan move from place to place as the chief reason, and this factor\r\ndoes undoubtedly play a part, but the widespread crossing of plants\r\nby insects makes up to some extent, as far as sexual intermingling\r\nis concerned, for their inability to move from place to place. I do\r\nnot know whether the species of orchid which are fertile with one\r\nanother belong to different countries, so that we may assume that they\r\noriginated in isolation, or whether fertile orchids from the same area\r\nare fertilized by different insects and are thus sexually isolated.\r\nThis and many other things must be taken into consideration. Probably\r\nthese relations have not yet been adequately investigated; probably\r\nwhat is known by some experts has not yet been made available to\r\nall. Future investigations and studies must throw more light upon the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nIn any case, however, we can see from the frequency of mutual fertility\r\namong plants that mutual sterility is not a _conditio sine qua non_\r\nof the splitting up of species, and we must beware of laying too\r\ngreat stress upon it even among animals. Germinal selection is a\r\nprocess which not only forms the basis of all personal selection, but\r\nwhich is also able to give rise of itself, without the usual aid of\r\nsexual intermingling, to a new specific type. And we cannot with any\r\nconfidence dispute that, even without amphigony, a certain degree of\r\npersonal selection may not ensue solely on the basis of the favourable\r\nvariational departures originating in the germ-plasm. It would be\r\npremature to express any definite views on this point as yet, but the\r\ndiverse cases of purely asexual or parthenogenetic reproduction in\r\ngroups of plants rich in species make this hypothesis seem probable.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable example of this is probably to be found in the\r\nLichens, the symbiotic nature of which we have already discussed,\r\nin which--now at least--neither the Fungus nor the Alga associated\r\nwith it is known to exhibit sexual reproduction. If this is really\r\nthe case, then the existence of numerous and well-marked species of\r\nlichens leads us to the hypothesis just expressed, and we must suppose\r\nthat the unity of the specific type is attained in this case solely\r\nby a continual sifting of the useful from the useless variations of\r\nthe determinants, and through purely germinal intensification of the\r\nsurviving variational tendencies.\r\n\r\nOf course it is possible that the mutual adaptation of the Algæ and\r\nFungi in the evolution of species of Lichens took place very long ago,\r\nat a time when sexual reproduction still existed, at least in one of\r\nthe associated organisms, the Fungus. The Ascomycetes, to which most\r\nof the Lichens belong, do not at present usually exhibit the process\r\nof amphimixis, as I have already noted; but it may perhaps be still\r\npossible to decide whether they must have exhibited it, or at least\r\ncould have exhibited it at an earlier stage in their evolution. As the\r\ngroup of Thallophytes is a very ancient one, it is not inconceivable\r\nthat the modern species of Lichens have existed for a long time, and\r\nthat they had their origin in the remote past with the assistance of\r\namphimixis.\r\n\r\nNor need it be objected to this supposition that it has been found\r\npossible to _make new Lichens_ by bringing together Fungi and Algæ\r\nwhich had not previously been associated with one another; for in\r\nthe first place both were already adapted to partnership with other\r\nspecies, and, moreover, so far no one has succeeded in rearing these\r\nartificial lichens for any length of time, still less in seeing them\r\nevolve into specific forms persistent in natural conditions.\r\n\r\nBut if this supposition should prove to be not only improbable, but\r\nactually erroneous, then the existence of Lichens would afford a clear\r\nproof that the 'type' of the species does not depend essentially upon\r\nthe constant intermingling of individuals, but upon a process which\r\nwe may best designate _uniformity of adaptation_. We have simply to\r\nsuppose that under similar external influences similar variational\r\ntendencies were started by germinal selection in all the individuals\r\nof the two parent species of a lichen, and set a-going by germinal\r\nselection, just as a warmer climate gives rise to a black variety\r\nin the butterfly _Polyommatus phlæas_, because similar determinants\r\nof the germ-plasm of all the individuals were impelled to vary in\r\nthe same manner and direction. This would then give rise to quite\r\ndefinite variations, and since only the suitable variational tendencies\r\ncould survive, primitive though never complicated adaptations would\r\narise. But we cannot assume that the lichens are not adapted to the\r\nconditions of their life as well as all other organisms. We cannot\r\njudge how far even their shape is to be regarded as an adaptation,\r\nwhether the formation of encrusting growths, of tree-like forms, of\r\ncup or bush-lichens, may not be regarded as adaptations towards a full\r\nutilization of the conditions of their life--but even if this is not\r\nthe case, the formation of soredia remains an undoubted adaptation to\r\nthe symbiosis of those lichens which exhibit them. The soredia cannot\r\ndepend upon the direct effect of the conditions of life, for they are\r\nreproductive bodies which did not exist before the existence of the\r\nlichen, and only originated to facilitate their distribution.\r\n\r\nThus there is still a great deal that is doubtful in our theories as to\r\nthe transformations of organisms, and much remains still to be done.\r\nBut even though we may doubt whether adaptations could come about in\r\nmulticellular organisms without amphigony, we may be quite certain of\r\nthe converse, that is, that the specific type can be changed in every\r\nindividual feature by natural selection on the basis of amphigony,\r\neven as regards invisible features which only express themselves in\r\naltered periods of growth. Even when there is no isolation whatever\r\nand no mutual sterility, and when a mobile species is uniformly\r\ndistributed over a large area, a splitting up into races in regard to\r\none particular character may occur, _simply through adaptation_ to the\r\nspatially different climatic conditions of the area inhabited.\r\n\r\nEarly in these lectures we discussed the twofold protective value of\r\nthe coloration of the 'variable hare' (_Lepus variabilis_), which is\r\ndistributed over the Arctic zone of the Old and New World, and also\r\noccurs in the higher regions of the Alps. Wherever there is a sharp\r\ncontrast between winter and summer the variable hare exhibits the\r\nsame specific type, being brown in summer and white in winter, but in\r\nregard to this very character of colour-change it forms races to some\r\nextent, for it is white for a longer or shorter time according to the\r\nlength of the winter--in Greenland for the whole twelve months of the\r\nyear, in Northern Norway only for eight or nine months, in the Alps\r\nfor six or seven months, but in the south of Sweden and in Ireland\r\nnot at all. There it remains brown in winter like our common hare\r\n(_Lepus timidus_). This is not a question of the direct effect of cold;\r\nif it were the species would become white in Southern Sweden also,\r\nfor there is no lack of severe cold there, but the ground is not so\r\nuninterruptedly covered with snow, and so the white colour of the hare\r\nwould be as often, probably oftener, a danger than a safeguard, and\r\nthe more primitive double coloration has therefore been done away with\r\nby natural selection. The change of colour is thus hereditarily fixed,\r\nas is proved by the fact that the Alpine hare, if caught and kept in\r\nthe valleys below, puts on a white dress at the usual time, which the\r\ncommon hare never does.\r\n\r\nAs in Southern Sweden the winter coloration has been wholly eliminated,\r\nso, conversely, from there to the Arctic zone the summer colouring\r\nhas been more and more crowded out, and in the Farthest North it has\r\ntotally disappeared from the characters of the species. We thus see\r\nthat wherever the species lives the double colouring is regulated,\r\nas regards the duration of the winter coat, in exact harmony with\r\nthe external conditions. There is a pure white, a pure brown, and\r\na colour-changing race, and the latter is subdivided into two--one\r\nwearing the winter dress for six, the other for eight months. Probably\r\nthese could be still further subdivided, if the different regions of\r\nthe Scandinavian Peninsula were investigated individually from south\r\nto north. That the duration of the winter dress has its roots in\r\nthe germ-plasm, and does not depend solely on the earlier or later\r\nperiod at which the cold sets in, is made clear by the two extreme\r\nforms, the white and the brown _Lepus variabilis_, as well as by the\r\nbehaviour of captive animals. The familiar case of Ross's lemming,\r\nwhich remained brown in the warm cabin, and then suddenly became\r\nwhite when it was exposed to the cold of winter, only shows that the\r\ncold acts as a liberating stimulus. The preparatory changes in the\r\npellage are already present, and the stimulus of cold brings them\r\nrapidly to a climax. Here, therefore, the necessary variations of the\r\nrelevant germinal parts must have continually presented themselves for\r\nselection, which is intelligible enough, since it is merely a question\r\nof plus- or minus-variations. The fact that the six-months' dress can\r\nbe transformed into an eight-months' dress must have its cause in some\r\nminute biological units of the germ-plasm; the determinants of the fur\r\nmust be able to vary in such a way that a longer or shorter duration of\r\nthe winter's coat is the result. The possibility of the whole variation\r\ndepends upon the continual fluctuations of all determinants, now\r\ntowards plus, now towards minus, and the necessity and inevitableness\r\nof each adaptation to the duration of the winter lies in the unceasing\r\npersonal selection--the inexorable preferring of the better adapted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN AND THE EXTINCTION OF SPECIES\r\n\r\nAdaptation does not depend upon chance--The case of eyes--Of\r\nleaf-mimicry--All persistent change depends ultimately on\r\nselection--Mutual sterility without great significance--Relative\r\nisolation (_Lepus variabilis_)--Influence of hybridization--Decadence\r\nof species--Differences in the duration of decadence--Natural\r\ndeath of individuals--Extinction due to excessive variability\r\n(Emery)?--_Machairodus_ as interpreted by Brandes--Lower types more\r\ncapable of adaptation than higher--Flightless birds--Disturbance of\r\ninsular fauna and flora by cultivation--The big game of Central Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the polar hare we have a case in which the adaptations to the life\r\nconditions both of time and space are recognizable as the effect of\r\ndefinite causes, and thus as a necessity; but the same must be true\r\neverywhere even in regard to the most complex adaptations which seem\r\nto depend entirely upon chance; everywhere adaptation results of\r\nnecessity--if it is possible at all with the given organization of the\r\nspecies--as certainly as the adaptation dress of the hare depends on\r\nthe length of the winter, and in point of fact not less certainly than\r\nthe blue colour of starch on the addition of iodine. The most delicate\r\nadaptations of the vertebrate eye to the task set for it by life in\r\nvarious groups have been gradually brought about as the necessary\r\nresults of definite causes, just in the same way as the complex\r\nprotective markings and colouring on the wing of the _Kallima_ and\r\nother leaf-mimicking butterflies.\r\n\r\nThat adaptations can be regarded as mechanically necessitated is due\r\nto the fact that in every process of adaptation the same direction of\r\nvariation on the part of the determinants concerned is guaranteed,\r\nsince personal selection eliminates those which vary in a wrong\r\ndirection, so that only those varying in a suitable direction survive,\r\nand they then continue to vary in the same direction. But the greatest\r\ndifference between our conception of natural selection and that of\r\nDarwin lies in this: that Darwin regarded its intervention as dependent\r\nupon chance, while we consider it as necessary and conditioned by the\r\nupward and downward intra-germinal fluctuation of the determinants.\r\nAppropriate variational tendencies not only _may_ present themselves,\r\nthey _must_ do so, if the germ-plasm contains determinants at all\r\nby whose fluctuations in a plus or minus direction the appropriate\r\nvariation is attainable.\r\n\r\nThat a horse should grow wings is beyond the limits of the\r\npossibilities of equine variation--there are no determinants which\r\ncould present variations directed towards this goal; but that any\r\nmulticellular animal which lives in the light should develop eyes lies\r\nwithin the variational possibilities of its ectoderm determinants, and\r\nin point of fact almost all such animals do possess eyes, and eyes,\r\ntoo, whose functional capacity may be increased in any direction, and\r\nwhich are adaptable and modifiable in any manner in accordance with\r\nthe requirements of the case. As soon as the determinants of the most\r\nprimitive eye came into existence, they formed the fundamental material\r\nby whose plus- or minus-variations all the marvellous eye structures\r\nmight be brought about, which we find in the different groups of the\r\nMetazoa, from a mere spot sensitive to light to a shadowy perception\r\nof a moving body, and from that again to the distinct recognition\r\nof a clear image, which we are aware of in our own eyes. And what\r\nwonderful special adaptations of the eye to near and to distant vision,\r\nto vision in the dusk and at night, or in the great ocean-depths, to\r\nrecognition of mere movement or the focussing of a clear image, have\r\nbeen interpolated in the course of this evolution!\r\n\r\nAll such adaptations are possible, because they can proceed from\r\nvariations of determinants which are in existence; and in the same\r\nway it is possible, at every stage of the evolution of organisms, for\r\neyes to degenerate again, whether they have been high up or low down\r\nin the scale of gradations of this perhaps the most delicate of all\r\nour sense-organs. As soon as a species migrated permanently from the\r\nlight into perfect darkness its eyes began to degenerate. We know\r\nblind flat worms, blind water-fleas and Isopods, also blind insects\r\nand higher Crustaceans, and even blind fishes and amphibians, the eyes\r\nof which are now to be found at very different levels of degeneration,\r\nas Eigenmann has recently shown in regard to several species of\r\ncave-dwelling salamanders of the State of Ohio. In all these cases\r\nit is only necessary for the determinants of the eye to continue to\r\nvary in the minus direction, and the disappearance of the eye must be\r\ngradually brought about.\r\n\r\nWe must picture upward development in quite a similar way. The forest\r\nbutterflies of the Tropics could not possibly all have their under\r\nsurfaces coloured like a leaf if the protective pattern depended solely\r\nupon the chance of a useful variation presenting itself. It always\r\npresented itself through the fluctuations of the determinants, and\r\nthus the appropriate colourings were not merely able to develop, but\r\nof necessity did so in gradually increasing perfection. If chance\r\nplayed any part in the matter, it would be quite unintelligible why the\r\nprotective colouring should occur only where it acts as a protection,\r\nand why, for instance, it should not appear sometimes upon the upper\r\nsurface of the butterfly wing, or upon the posterior wings which are\r\ncovered when the butterfly is at rest. We have already studied in\r\ndetail the precision with which the coloration is localized on minute\r\npoints and corners of the wing: this can only be understood if natural\r\nselection works with the certainty of a perfect mechanism. Chance only\r\ncomes into the matter in so far as it depends upon chance whether the\r\nrelevant determinants in one id or another are to vary in the direction\r\nof plus or minus; but as the germ-plasm contains many ids, and chance\r\nmay decide it differently in each of these, the presence of a majority\r\nof determinants varying in a desirable direction does not depend upon\r\nchance, for if they are not contained in one individual they are in\r\nanother. It is only necessary that they should be present in some, and\r\nthat these should be selected for reproduction.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore regard natural selection, that is to say, _personal\r\nselection_, as a mechanical process of development, which begins\r\nwith the same certainty and works 'in a straight line' towards its\r\n'goal,' just as any principle of development might be supposed to do.\r\nFundamentally it is after all a purely internal force which gives\r\nrise to evolution, the power of the most minute vital units to vary\r\nunder changing influences, and it is only the guidance of evolution\r\nalong particular paths that is essentially left to personal selection,\r\nwhich brings together what is useful and thus determines the direction\r\nof further evolution. If we bear in mind that even the minutest\r\nvariations of the biophors and determinants express nothing more or\r\nless than reactions to changed external conditions in the direction of\r\nadaptation, and that the same is true of each of the higher categories\r\nof vital units, whether they be called cell, tissue, organ, person,\r\nor corm, we see that the whole evolution of the forms of life upon\r\nthe earth depends upon adaptations following each other in unbroken\r\nsuccession, and fitting into each other in the most complex way. The\r\nwhole evolution is made possible by the power of variation of the\r\nliving units of every grade, and called forth and directed by the\r\nceaseless changes of the external influences. I said years ago that\r\n_everything_ in organic evolution depended upon selection, for every\r\nlasting change in a vital unit means adaptation to changed external\r\ninfluences, and implies a preference in favour of the parts of the unit\r\nconcerned, which are thereby more fitly disposed.\r\n\r\nIn this sense we can also say that the species is a complex of\r\nadaptations, for we have seen that it depends upon the co-operation\r\nof different grades of selective processes, that in many cases it is\r\nproduced solely by germinal selection, but that in very many more\r\npersonal selection plays the chief part, whether in bringing about\r\nsexual adaptations, or adaptations to the conditions of existence.\r\n\r\nWhen we have thus recognized that the origin of a variation in a\r\ndefinite direction results as inevitably when it is called forth by the\r\nindirect influence of conditions, that is, through the need for a new\r\nadaptation, as when it is induced in the germ-plasm by direct causes\r\nsuch as those of climate, we shall not be disposed to estimate very\r\nhighly the part played by mutual sterility in the origin of species. We\r\nshall rather be inclined to assign it a rôle at a later stage, after\r\nthe separation of the forms has taken place, and this view is supported\r\nby the fact of the mutual sterility of most nearly related species, and\r\nby the theoretical consideration that the frequency of hybrids, even if\r\nthese are always eliminated in the struggle for existence, must signify\r\na loss for both the parent species. But no certain conclusion can be\r\nbased upon either of these arguments--not upon the theoretical one,\r\nbecause here again we are unable to estimate the extent of this loss;\r\nand not upon the argument from fact, because the results of experiments\r\nin crossing animals have generally been overestimated, since we are apt\r\nto regard the most nearly related animals that are at our disposal as\r\nbeing very closely related. Thus, for instance, horse and ass, horse\r\nand zebra are undoubtedly rightly included within the same genus, but\r\nthe fact that there are several species of zebra in Africa gives us an\r\nidea of the number of transition stages that may have existed between\r\nthe horse and the zebra. Entomologists have sometimes reared hybrids\r\nbetween the most nearly related indigenous species of hawk-moth of\r\nthe genus _Smerinthus_--hybrids of _Smerinthus ocellata_, the eyed\r\nhawk-moth, and _Smerinthus populi_, the poplar hawk-moth. I have myself\r\nmade many experiments of this kind, and have often succeeded in getting\r\nthe two species to pair and even to deposit eggs, but I have never\r\nseen a caterpillar emerge from them. The hybrids do occur, however,\r\nand they have been repeatedly obtained by Standfuss. In external\r\nappearance they are intermediate between the parent forms, but with\r\nmarked divergences, thus, for instance, the beautiful blue eye on the\r\nposterior wing of _S. ocellata_ (Fig. 5, vol. i. p. 69) may have almost\r\ndisappeared or be only indicated. They are sterile. But we know three\r\nspecies of _Smerinthus_ in North America, which are all much nearer to\r\n_S. ocellata_ than _S. populi_ is, for they all possess the eye-spot\r\nreferred to, although it is less well developed. The proof that the\r\nmost nearly related species do not yield fertile descendants should be\r\nsought for by crossing _Smerinthus ocellata_ with one of these American\r\nspecies if it is to have any decisive value.\r\n\r\nExperiments of the same kind have been made by Standfuss with different\r\nspecies of indigenous _Saturnia_, and these have shown not only that\r\ncrossing is possible, but that the hybrids are fertile in their turn.\r\nThese results are to be valued the more highly because it is well known\r\nthat Lepidoptera, and even the usually prolific silk-moths, do not\r\nreadily reproduce in captivity, even within the same species. We have\r\nin _Saturnia pyri_, _spini_, and _carpini_ three well-marked distinct\r\nspecies with no intermediate forms in nature, and with quite different\r\ncolouring in the caterpillars. That these should have been successfully\r\ncombined in a triple hybrid proves at least that sexual alienation\r\ncannot have advanced far in this case.\r\n\r\nWe must beware, however, of attributing too much to the constant\r\nmutual crossing which occurs in a species living on a connected area\r\nand of regarding its influence as irresistible. Undoubtedly it must\r\ngo far towards securing the uniformity of individuals, but not only\r\nis it unable to achieve this, but it cannot successfully resist the\r\nstronger influences making for variation which may be exerted upon a\r\npart of the area of the species. We have already seen that it is quite\r\nerroneous to suppose that every new adaptation must be lost sight of\r\nagain because of the continual crossing with other members of the\r\nspecies upon the same area. Other things being equal, this depends\r\nentirely upon the importance of the adaptation in question. Just as\r\nclimatic influences may be so strong that they entirely overcome the\r\ninfluence of crossing, and give rise to a local race notwithstanding\r\nimperfect geographical isolation, so the same may happen in the case of\r\nadaptations. It is quite conceivable that the polar hare of Scandinavia\r\nmay have evolved a whole series of races, each of which is adapted\r\nto the duration of the snow in its geographical range, although a\r\ncrossing of these quick-footed animals must frequently occur in the\r\ncourse of time, even as regards forms from widely separated areas, and\r\nalthough the whole region is inhabited without a break by the species,\r\nso that a 'mingling' of the hares of all regions from south to north,\r\nand conversely, may take place, and indeed must be continually taking\r\nplace, though of course very slowly.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely this extreme slowness with which the intermingling\r\nof racial characters take place that seems to me essential for the\r\nproduction of local or, as in this case, regional races. It is not\r\ndifficult to calculate the rate of 'blood-distribution' if we assume\r\nthat the conditions for a rapid dissemination are as favourable as\r\npossible. Let us assume that it takes place along a certain line--in\r\nthis case from south to north--and that the numerical strength of\r\nthe species remains constant, each pair of hares yielding a pair of\r\nsurviving offspring, which will attain to reproduction. Let us suppose\r\nthat one of these hares moves his home northwards to the extent of his\r\nrange, that is, as far as a hare is accustomed to range from his head\r\nquarters, and that he pairs with one of the descendants on the next\r\nstretch.\r\n\r\nLet us further suppose that this stretch is ten kilometres in extent,\r\nand that the change of quarters take place once in each year, then the\r\nblood of a South Scandinavian hare would have extended ten kilometres\r\nfurther north in ten years, and in a hundred years 100 kilometres; it\r\nwould not, however, be quite pure, but mixed and thinned by crossing\r\nwith a hundred mates of different individual bloods, that is, thinned\r\nto the extent of 2 to the 100^{th} power, that is, to less than a\r\nmillionth part. Thus even with these much too favourable assumptions\r\nthe influence of a region of hares 100 kilometres distant would be\r\nactually _nil_ upon the inhabitants of a region which was in process\r\nof new adaptation. That the assumptions are too favourable is quite\r\nobvious, since every surviving hare would not be likely to move his\r\nhome, and probably the majority would remain in the old quarters\r\nand find mates there. The blood-mingling would therefore take place\r\nmuch more rarely, perhaps only once in ten years, and the wandering\r\ndescendants of the second generation might move southward, and so\r\nneutralize the previous blood-mingling, and so on. But let us keep\r\nto our favourable assumptions, and attempt to determine how strong\r\nthe assimilating influence of the blood-mingling from south to north\r\nwould be upon a point _A_. The blood of the nearest stretch diluted\r\nto a half would affect the inhabitants of _A_ once in each year; the\r\nsecond stretch would only contribute blood of 1/4 strength, the third\r\nof 1/8, the fourth of 1/16, and the blood of the tenth would be diluted\r\nto 1/1024. A region _B_, extending over twenty such stretches, or 200\r\nkilometres, would thus shelter within it a hare population of which\r\nthe centre would only be influenced from the periphery in vanishing\r\nproportions. If the winter were of equal length over the whole area of\r\n_B_, all the inhabitants would be tending to vary the period for which\r\nthe winter dress was worn in correspondence with the length of the\r\nwinter, and the centre of the region would be the less impeded in this\r\nprocess because the more peripheral areas would also be approximating\r\nto the same adaptation. But since even the admixture of 1/32 of strange\r\nblood could have no hindering influence upon a variation, there would\r\nremain a region of 2 × 5 = 10 stretches upon which the influence of\r\nthe non-varying regions would be without effect. There would therefore\r\narise a new race in relation to the duration of the winter dress, and\r\nthis would not cease abruptly, but would gradually pass over into the\r\nneighbouring regions, which however would be pure at their centre, just\r\nas is probably the case in reality, if we regard _B_ as any point in\r\nthe line of distribution from south to north.\r\n\r\nThe harmony of the individuals within a species will therefore depend\r\nin part upon the mingling of hereditary primary constituents associated\r\nwith reproduction, but in greater part upon adaptation to the same\r\nconditions; it is _a similarity of adaptation_, and the strongest\r\ninfluence which sexual reproduction exerts lies not in the mingling of\r\nthese hereditary constituents alone, but above all in the reduction\r\nin the germ-plasm of the two parental hereditary contributions--a\r\nreduction which results from and through the sexual intermingling. It\r\nis only this that prevents these primary constituents from varying at\r\ntoo unequal a rate in the transformations of species, and causes them\r\nultimately to resemble each other closely again.\r\n\r\nBut while mutual sterility is not an absolutely necessary condition in\r\nthe separation of species, it would be going too far in the opposite\r\ndirection to regard mutual fertility as something general, or to\r\nattribute to it a rôle in the origination of new species.\r\n\r\nCertain botanists, like Kerner von Marilaun, regard the mingling of\r\nspecies as a means of forming new species with better adaptations;\r\nthey suppose that fertile hybrids may, in certain circumstances, crowd\r\nout the parent species, and themselves become new species. It will be\r\nadmitted that such cases do occur, that, for instance, in the north of\r\nEurope the hybrid between the large and the small water-lily, _Nuphar\r\nluteum_ and _Nuphar pumilum_, to which the name _Nuphar intermedium_\r\nhas been given, has driven both the parent species from the field,\r\nbecause its seeds mature earlier, and it is therefore better adapted\r\nto the short vegetative period of the north, but nevertheless we must\r\nmaintain that the evolution of species on the whole does not take\r\nplace through hybridization. Such cases are probably nothing more than\r\nrare exceptions. This is corroborated by the entire insignificance of\r\nhybridization in animals, among which species appear in the same way as\r\nthey do in plants, and where the mingling of two species occurs only\r\nsporadically and in a few species, never to any very great extent.\r\n\r\nIf species are complexes of adaptations, based in each case on the\r\ngiven physical constitution of the parent species, then we can readily\r\nunderstand the fact that they are in our experience not fixed or\r\neternal, but that they change in the course of the earth's history.\r\nThe numerous fossil remains in the various strata of the earth's crust\r\nprove that this is true in a high degree, that in almost every one of\r\nthe more important geological strata new species occur, and that not\r\nonly species and genera, but families, orders, indeed whole classes\r\nof animals, which lived at one time, have now completely disappeared\r\nfrom the face of the earth. We can understand this phenomenon when we\r\nreflect that the conditions of life have also been slowly changing\r\nthrough the course of the earth's history, so that the old species had\r\nonly the alternative of dying out, or of becoming transformed into new\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nBut simple as this conclusion is, it can hardly be deduced with\r\ncertainty from the occurrence and succession of the fossil species\r\nalone. For instance, we should strive in vain to recognize the\r\ncause which led one of those regularly arranged snail-species of\r\nthe Steinheim lake basin to become transformed into one or two new\r\nspecies at a particular time, or to find the cause which moved those\r\ncurious tripartite Crustaceans of primitive times, the Trilobites,\r\nwhich peopled the Silurian seas with such a wealth of forms, to\r\nbecome suddenly scarce towards the end of the Silurian period, and\r\nto disappear altogether in the succeeding period, the Devonian. The\r\nfamous geologist Neumayr sought to refer this striking phenomenon to\r\nthe fact that just at that time the Cephalopods, 'the most formidable\r\nand savage marauders among the invertebrate marine fauna,' gained the\r\nascendancy, and it is quite possible that he was right in his surmise,\r\nbut who is to prove it? Can we decide even in the case of animals now\r\nliving whether the losses inflicted on a much persecuted species by an\r\nabundant and greedy persecutor exceed the numbers of progeny, and are\r\ntherefore driving the species gradually towards extermination? Probable\r\nas such a supposition appears, it cannot be accepted as proven.\r\n\r\nSince in many cases of the extinction of great animal-groups we cannot\r\neven prove that there was a simultaneous ascendancy of powerful\r\nenemies, other factors must be discovered to which the apparently\r\nsudden disappearance may be attributed. Many naturalists have tried\r\nto guess at internal reasons for extinction, and have adopted the\r\ntheory--associated with the tendency to assume mystical principles of\r\nevolution--that species in dying out are obeying an internal necessity,\r\nas if their birth and death were predestined, as it is in the case of\r\nmulticellular individuals, as if there were a _physiological death of\r\nthe species_ as there is of the multicellular individual.\r\n\r\nNeumayr showed, however, that the facts of palæontology afford no\r\nsupport for this view. I need not repeat his arguments, but will simply\r\nrefer to his clear and concise exposition of the problem. It is obvious\r\nthat our theory of the extinction of species as due to external causes\r\ncannot be rejected on the ground that our knowledge of the struggle\r\nthat species had to maintain for their existence in past times is\r\neven mere imperfect than our knowledge of the struggle nowadays, and\r\nthat we are frequently unable to judge of it at all. But the facts of\r\ngeology are of value in another, quite different way. They reveal such\r\nan extraordinary dissimilarity in the duration of species, and also\r\nof the great groups of organisms, that the dissimilarity of itself\r\nis sufficient to prevent our regarding the extinction of species as\r\nregulated by _internal_ causes. Certain genera of Echinoderms, such as\r\nstarfish (_Astropecten_), lived in the Silurian times, and they are\r\nrepresented nowadays in our seas by a number of species: and in the\r\nsame way the Cephalopod genus _Nautilus_ has maintained itself among\r\nthe living all through the enormous period from the Silurian sea to our\r\nown day. Formerly the Nautilids formed a predatory horde that peopled\r\nthe seas, and, as we have seen, we may perhaps attribute to their\r\ndominance the disappearance of an order of Crustaceans, the Trilobites,\r\nwhich were equally abundant at that period. Now only a single species\r\nof nautilus (_Nautilus pompilius_) lives on the coral reefs of the\r\nsouthern seas. Similarly, the genus _Lingula_ of the nearly extinct\r\nclass of Brachiopods, somewhat mussel-like sessile marine animals, has\r\nbeen preserved from the grey dawn of primitive times, with its records\r\nin the oldest deposits, and is represented in the living world of\r\nto-day by the so-called 'barnacle-goose' mussel, _Lingula anatina_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we know of numerous species which lasted for quite\r\na short time, such as, for instance, the individual members of the\r\nseries of Steinheim _Planorbis_ species, or of the Slavonic _Paludina_\r\nspecies. Not infrequently, too, genera make their appearance and\r\ndisappear again within the period of one and the same geological\r\nstratum.\r\n\r\nThese facts not only tell against an unknown vitalistic principle of\r\nevolution, but in general against the idea of the determination of\r\nthe great paths of evolution by purely internal causes. If there were\r\na principle of evolution the dissimilarity in the duration of life\r\ncould not be so excessive; if there were a 'senile stage' of species\r\nand a natural death of species comparable to the natural death of\r\nindividuals, it would not have been possible for most of the Nautilidæ\r\nto have been restricted to the Silurian epoch, and yet for one species\r\nto have continued to live till now; and if there were a 'tendency'\r\nof species to vary persistently onwards, and to 'become further and\r\nfurther removed from the primitive type,' as has been maintained, then\r\nsuch ancient and primitive Cephalopod forms like the _Nautilus_-species\r\ncould not have persisted until now, but must long ago have Wen\r\ntransmuted into higher forms. The converse, however, is conceivable\r\nenough, namely, that the great mass of the species of a group such as\r\nthe Nautilidæ were crowded out by superior rivals in the struggle for\r\nexistence, but that certain species were able to survive on specially\r\nprotected or otherwise favoured areas. We have a fine example of this\r\nin the few still living species of the otherwise extinct class of\r\nGanoid fishes. During the Primary and Secondary epochs these Ganoids\r\npeopled all the seas, but at the boundary between the Cretaceous and\r\nthe Tertiary period they retrograded considerably, simultaneously with\r\nthe great development of bony fishes or Teleosteans, and now they are\r\nonly represented by a dozen species distributed over the earth, and\r\nmost of these are purely river forms, while the others at least ascend\r\nthe rivers during the spawning season to secure the safety of their\r\nprogeny. For the rivers are sheltered areas as compared with the seas,\r\nand large fishes like the Ganoids will be able there to hold their\r\nown in the struggle better than they could in the incomparably more\r\nabundantly peopled sea.\r\n\r\nThus I can only regard it as playing with ideas to speak of birth,\r\nblossoming, standstill, decay, and death of species in any other than a\r\nfigurative sense. Undoubtedly the life of the species may be compared\r\nwith that of the individual, and if the comparison be used only to make\r\nclear the difference between the causes of the two kinds of phenomena,\r\nthere can be no objection to it, only we must beware of thinking we\r\nhave explained anything we do not know by comparing it with something\r\nelse that is also unknown.\r\n\r\nWe have already shown that the natural death of multicellular organisms\r\nis a phenomenon which first made its appearance with the separation\r\nof the organism into somatic or body cells and reproductive or germ\r\ncells, and that death is not an inevitable Nemesis of every life, for\r\nunicellular organisms do not necessarily die, though they may be killed\r\nby violence. These unicellular organisms have thus no natural death,\r\nand we have to explain its occurrence among multicellular organisms\r\nas an adaptation to the cellular differentiation, which makes the\r\nunlimited continuance of the life of the whole organism unnecessary and\r\npurposeless, and even prejudicial to the continuance of the species.\r\nFor the species it is enough if the germ-cells alone retain the\r\npotential immortality of the unicellulars, while, on the other hand,\r\nthe high differentiation of the somatic cells necessarily involves\r\nthat they should wear themselves away in the performance of their\r\nfunctions, and so become subject to death, or at least that they should\r\nundergo such changes that they are no longer capable of functioning\r\nproperly, so that thus the organism as a whole loses the power of life.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt whatever that death is virtually implied in\r\nthe very constitution of a multicellular organism, and is thus, so\r\nto speak, a foreseen occurrence, the inevitable end of a development\r\nwhich begins with the egg-cell and reaches its highest point with the\r\nliberation of the germ-cells, that is, with reproduction, and then\r\nenters on a longer or shorter period of decadence, leading to the\r\nnatural death of the individual.\r\n\r\nIt is only by straining the analogy that this course of development\r\ncan be compared with the origin and transformation or extinction of\r\nspecies. Not even the entirely external analogy of the blossoming\r\nfrom a small beginning and the subsequent decay is always correct;\r\nfor in the fresh-water snails of Steinheim, at any rate, almost the\r\nwhole of the members of the species underwent a transformation at a\r\nparticular time, and became a new species, which was after a long\r\ntime retransformed without any appreciable decrease in the number of\r\nindividuals being observable. To speak of a 'senile stage' of the\r\nspecies, of a stiffening of its form, of an incapacity for further\r\ntransformation, is to indulge in a play of fancy quite inadmissible in\r\nthe domain of natural science.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted, however, that there is a correct idea at the base of\r\nall this, for many species have not passed over into new forms, but\r\nhave simply died out because they were unable to adapt themselves\r\nto changed conditions. This did not happen because they had become\r\nincapable of variation, but because they could not produce variations\r\nof sufficient magnitude, or variations of the kind required to enable\r\nthe species to remain an active competitor in the struggle for\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIt obviously depends upon the coincidence of manifold circumstances,\r\nwhether an adaptation can be successfully effected or not. Above all,\r\nit must be able to keep pace with the changes in the conditions of\r\nlife, for if these advance at a more rapid rate the organisms will\r\nsuccumb in the midst of the attempt at adaptation. It is probably\r\nin this way that the striking disappearance of the Trilobites is to\r\nbe explained, as Neumayr has pointed out, for the Nautilidæ, a new\r\ngroup of enemies, multiplied so quickly at their expense that they\r\nhad not time to evolve any effective means of protection. It cannot\r\nbe maintained for a moment that every species is able to protect\r\nitself against extermination by any other; the increased fertility,\r\nthe increased rapidity of locomotion, the increased intelligence\r\nand similar qualities, may all be insufficient, and then extinction\r\nfollows; not, however, because the species has become 'senile,' but\r\nbecause the variations possible to its organization do not suffice to\r\nmaintain it in the struggle.\r\n\r\nIn discussing germinal selection I mentioned the view expressed\r\nby Emery, that excessive variation in the same direction from\r\nintra-germinal causes has not rarely been the cause of the extinction\r\nof species. I also mentioned the very similar view of Döderlein,\r\nwho could not refer at that time to germinal selection, but assumed\r\ninternal compelling forces, which pressed a variation irresistibly\r\nforward in the direction in which it had started, even beyond the\r\nbounds of what is useful for the desired end, and which might thus\r\nbring about the extinction of the species. I cannot entirely agree\r\nwith these views, as I have already indicated, because I do not\r\nbelieve that the impulse to variation can ever become irresistible\r\nand uncontrollable. If it could, then we should not see, as we do,\r\ninnumerable cases in which the augmentation or diminution of a part has\r\ngone on precisely to the point at which it ceases to be purposeful.\r\nEven the degeneration of organs only proceeds as far as is necessary\r\nto accomplish a particular end, as we see plainly from the parasitic\r\nCrustaceans of different orders. In many of these parasitic forms the\r\nswimming legs degenerate, but in the female only, because these attach\r\nthemselves by suckers or in some other manner to their host, so that\r\nthey cannot let go again. But the males need their swimming legs to\r\nseek out the females. The females too require them in their youth,\r\nin order to seek out the fish from which they are to obtain their\r\nfood-supply, and thus the degeneration of the swimming legs has come to\r\na full stop exactly at the point where they cease to be of use; they\r\ndevelop in early youth and degenerate later, when the animal becomes\r\nsessile. In accordance with the law of biogenesis we may say that\r\nwhile the degeneration is complete in the final stages of ontogeny,\r\nits retrogression was not continued back to the germ, but only to the\r\nyoung stages. From this it follows that the progress of a variation\r\nmay at any time have a goal fixed for it, and we have seen that this\r\nis possible by means of personal selection, which accumulates the\r\nnever-failing fluctuations of the variation in the direction of plus or\r\nof minus. In the individual id a determinant _X_ may perhaps decrease\r\nand possibly also increase without limit, although we have no certain\r\nknowledge in regard to the latter point, but as this determinant is\r\ncontained in all the ids, there are always plus and minus fluctuations\r\nby means of which personal selection can operate.\r\n\r\nBut of course it requires a certain amount of time for this, and in\r\nthe fact that this time is often not available lies, I think, the\r\nreason why excessive differentiations have often led to the extinction\r\nof a species, not because the increase of the excessive organ must go\r\non irresistibly, but because changes in the conditions have made the\r\nexuberant organ inappropriate, and it could not degenerate quickly\r\nenough to save the species from extinction.\r\n\r\nBrandes has recently given a beautiful illustration of this by\r\nassociating the existence of the remarkable sabre-toothed tigers\r\n(_Machairodus_) with enormously long canine teeth, which lived in the\r\nDiluvial period in South America, with the gigantic Armadillos which\r\nlived there at the same time, whose bony armature two yards in height\r\nnow excites our admiration. He rightly points out that the dentition of\r\n_Machairodus neogæus_ is by no means a typically perfect dentition for\r\na beast of prey, like that of the Indian tiger or the lion; as far as\r\nincisors and molars are concerned it was much less effective than that\r\nof these predatory animals, and the great length of the dagger-like\r\nflattened canines, which protruded far beyond the mouth, entirely\r\nprevented the bringing together of the teeth of the upper and lower jaw\r\nafter the fashion of a pair of pincers. He rightly infers from this\r\nthat this dentition was adapted to a specialized mode of nutrition, and\r\nhe regards the great mailed Armadillos, such as the three-yards-long\r\nheavy Glyptodont of the Pampas, as the victims into which they were\r\nwont to thrust their sabre-teeth in the region of the unprotected\r\nneck, and thus to master the almost invulnerable creature, which was\r\ninvincible as far as all other predatory animals were concerned. Thus\r\nthe remarkable dentition is explained on the one hand, and on the other\r\nthe amazing extent and hardness of the victim's coat of mail. Thus,\r\ntoo, we can understand why there should have been at that time a whole\r\nseries of cat-like animals with sabre-like teeth, in which the length\r\nand sharpness of the teeth increased with the bodily size, for these\r\npredatory animals corresponded to a whole series of Armadillos, whose\r\nsize was increasing, as was also the strength of their armour.\r\n\r\nOf course this interpretation is hypothetical, but it contains much\r\ninternal probability, so that it may be taken as a good illustration\r\nof the reciprocal increase of adaptations between two animal groups.\r\nWe understand now why, on the one hand, this colossal tortoise-like\r\narmour should have developed in a mammal, and, on the other hand,\r\nwhy these enormously long sabre-teeth should have been evolved; we\r\nalso understand--and this is the point with which we are here chiefly\r\nconcerned--why these two 'excessive' developments should ultimately\r\nlead to the destruction of their possessors. For a long period\r\nthe Armadillos were able to save themselves from extermination by\r\nincreasing their bodily size and the strength of their armour, and\r\nthey thus saved themselves from persecution on the part of beasts of\r\nprey with smaller and weaker teeth. But the predatory animals followed\r\nsuit and lengthened their teeth and increased their bodily size,\r\nuntil ultimately even the strongest armour of the victim afforded\r\nno efficient protection, and the mighty Glyptodonts were by degrees\r\nutterly exterminated. But then the death-knell of the _Machairodus_\r\nhad also sounded, for he was so exactly adapted to this one kind of\r\ndiet that he could no longer overpower other victims and feed on their\r\nflesh; the sabre-teeth prevented him from tearing his prey like other\r\npredatory animals, he could probably only suck them.\r\n\r\nEven if this is a supposititious case, it serves to show that it was\r\nnot an internal principle of variation that caused the teeth of these\r\ncarnivores and the armour of their victims to increase so unlimitedly;\r\nit was the necessity of adaptation. They did not perish because armour\r\nand teeth increased so excessively, but because neither of these\r\nadaptations could be neutralized all at once, and small variations were\r\nof no use to them in their final struggle for survival.\r\n\r\nIn a certain sense we may say that simpler, more lowly organisms are\r\nmore capable of adaptation than those which are highly differentiated\r\nand adapted to specialized conditions in all parts of their bodies,\r\nsince from the former much that is new may arise in the course of time,\r\nwhile very little and nothing very novel can spring from the latter.\r\nFrom the simplest Protozoan the whole world of unicellular organisms\r\ncould arise, and also the much more diverse Metazoa; from the lower\r\nmarine worms there could arise not only many kinds of higher marine\r\nworms--the segmented worms or Annelids--but also quite new groups of\r\nanimals, the Arthropods and the Vertebrates. It is hardly likely that a\r\nnew class of animals will evolve from our modern birds, because these\r\nare already so perfectly adapted to their aerial life that they could\r\nhardly adapt themselves to life on land or in the water sufficiently\r\nwell to be able to hold their own in regard to all the possibilities of\r\nlife with the rest of the dwellers on land or in water. We do indeed\r\nknow of birds which have returned entirely to a purely terrestrial\r\nlife--the ostriches, for instance--and of others which have adapted\r\nthemselves to a purely aquatic life, such as the penguins, but these\r\nare small groups of species, and are hardly likely to increase. On\r\nthe contrary, we can prove that many have already succumbed in the\r\nstruggle with man, and we anticipate the extermination of others. But\r\nthe reason why they are so readily exterminated obviously lies in the\r\nfact that they have surrendered the advantage given to them by their\r\nbird-nature, by adapting themselves to terrestrial life, and that they\r\nare not able to regain it, at least not in the short time that is at\r\ntheir disposal if they are to be saved from extermination. The best\r\nexample of this is the Dodo (_Didus ineptus_). This remarkable-looking\r\nbird, of about the size of a swan, lived in flocks upon the island of\r\nMauritius until about the end of the seventeenth century. It had small\r\nwings with short quills which were useless for flight. As it could\r\nneither escape by flight nor through the water, and could only move\r\nclumsily and awkwardly upon land with its short legs and heavy body, it\r\nwas hopelessly doomed as soon as a stronger enemy made his appearance.\r\nIt fell a victim to the sailors who first landed on the island and\r\nclubbed it with sticks in huge numbers. Until that event it was without\r\ndoubt excellently adapted to life on that fertile island, for on a\r\nvolcanic island in the middle of the ocean there were no large enemies,\r\nand it was therefore not dependent on the power of flight for safety,\r\nand could pick up abundant food from the ground. But when man suddenly\r\nappeared on the scene and began to persecute it, it was not the 'senile\r\nrigidity' of its organization that prevented it from making use of\r\nits wings again; it was the slowness of variation and consequently\r\nof selection, which is common to all species, which impelled it to\r\nextinction. The same fate will probably overtake the Kiwi of New\r\nZealand (_Apteryx australis_) in the near future, for though it has\r\nso far escaped the arrows of the aborigines, it is not likely in its\r\nwingless condition to be able to hold out long against European guns,\r\nunless close times and preserved forests are instituted for it, as they\r\nhave been for our chamois.\r\n\r\nEven sadder from the biologist's point of view than such extermination\r\nof individual species through the vandalism and greed of our own\r\nrace is the disturbance of whole societies of animals and plants by\r\nman that is going on or has been accomplished on most of the oceanic\r\nislands, and we must briefly notice these cases while we are dealing\r\nwith the decadence of species. I refer to the crowding out of the\r\nusually endemic animal and plant population on such islands through\r\ncultivation. The first step in this work of 'cultivation' is always the\r\ncutting down of the forests which for thousands of years have clothed\r\nthese islands as with a mantle of green, have regulated their rainfall,\r\nsecured their fertility, and allowed a medley of indigenous animals,\r\nusually peculiar to the spot, to arise. We have already spoken of St.\r\nHelena. The original and remarkable fauna and flora of this island had\r\nfor the most part disappeared 200 years ago, through the cutting down\r\nof trees in the forests, and these were later wholly destroyed by the\r\nintroduction of goats, which devoured all the young trees as they grew.\r\nBut with the forests most of the indigenous insects and birds were\r\ndoomed to destruction, so that now there is not an indigenous bird or\r\nbutterfly to be found there; only a few terrestrial snails and beetles\r\nof the original fauna still survive.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only on islands that a large number of species have\r\nbeen decimated or entirely exterminated by deforestation, by the\r\nintroduction of plants cultivated by man and of the 'weeds' associated\r\nwith these, and by the importation of domesticated animals. In Central\r\nEurope not only have all the larger beasts of prey, like the bear, the\r\nlynx, and the wolf, almost completely disappeared, but the reindeer,\r\nthe bison, the wild ox (Aurochs), and the elk have been exterminated\r\nas wild animals, and in North America the buffalo will soon only exist\r\nin preserved herds, if that is not already the case. Here, of course,\r\nthe direct interference of the all-too-powerful enemy, man, has played\r\nthe largest part in causing the disappearance of the species referred\r\nto, but the process may give us an idea of the way in which a superior\r\nanimal enemy may be able gradually to exterminate a weaker species\r\nwhere there is no attainable or even conceivable variation which\r\nmight preserve them from such a fate. Several of the mammals which I\r\nhave mentioned are not yet entirely exterminated; even the Aurochs\r\nperhaps still exists in the pure white herds preserved in some British\r\nparks; but there are more instances than that of the Dodo of the utter\r\nextermination of a species through human agency within historic times.\r\nIt may be doubtful whether the sea-otter (_Enhydris marina_) has not\r\nbeen already quite exterminated because of its precious fur, but it is\r\nquite certain that the huge sea-cow (_Rhytina stelleri_), which lived\r\nin large numbers in the Behring Straits at the end of the eighteenth\r\nand the beginning of the nineteenth centuries, was completely\r\nexterminated by sailors within a few decades.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore gain from what is going on before our eyes, so to\r\nspeak, some sort of idea of the way in which the extermination of\r\nspecies may go on even independently of man at the present time, and\r\nhow it must have gone on also in past ages of the earth's history.\r\nMigrations of species have taken place ceaselessly, although very\r\nslowly, for every species is endeavouring slowly to extend its range\r\nand to take possession of new territories, and thus the fauna and\r\nflora of any region must have changed in the course of time, new\r\nspecies must have settled in it from time to time, and the conditions\r\nof life must have changed, and in many cases this must have led to the\r\nextermination of species, in the same way, though not so quickly, as\r\nhuman interference now brings about their doom.\r\n\r\nThis is true for plants as for animals. A good example, not indeed of\r\ncomplete extermination, but of very considerable diminution in the\r\nnumbers of individuals of a plant-species by the advent of a species of\r\nmammal, is communicated to us by Chun in regard to Kerguelen Land. A\r\nflowering plant, the Kerguelen cabbage (_Pringlea antiscorbutica_), has\r\nbeen greatly reduced in numbers since the thoughtless introduction of\r\nrabbits to this uninhabited island (1874). While, in 1840, Captain Ross\r\nused this plant in great quantities as a preventative against scurvy in\r\nhis crew, and even carried away stores to last for months, the Valdivia\r\nExpedition in 1898 found rabbits in abundance, but the Kerguelen\r\ncabbage had been entirely exterminated at every spot accessible to\r\nthese prolific and voracious rodents. It was only found growing upon\r\nperpendicular cliffs or upon the islands lying out in the fiords.\r\n\r\nAn avoidance of the threatened destruction of a species by its\r\nadaptation to the new circumstances can only be possible when the\r\nchanges occur very slowly, and will therefore be more likely to be\r\nachieved in the case of physical changes in the conditions of life,\r\nsuch as climatic changes, a change in the mutual relations of land\r\nand sea, and so on. But it appears that even climatic changes do\r\nnot evoke any variation and new adaptation as long as the species\r\ncan avoid the changes by migrating. The often quoted case of Alpine\r\nand Arctic plants proves this at any rate, that those species which\r\ninhabited the plateaus and highlands of Europe did not all vary to\r\nsuit the change when a warmer climate prevailed, but that in part at\r\nleast they followed the climate to which they were already adapted,\r\nthat is, that they migrated towards the north on the one hand and\r\nhigher up the Alps on the other. It cannot be denied that many of the\r\ninsects and plants did adapt themselves at that time to the warmer\r\nclimate, and became the modern species which now inhabit the plains,\r\nfor many related species occur on the Alps and in the plains, but\r\napparently many others simply made their escape from a climate which\r\nno longer suited their requirements. Thus, as far as I am aware, there\r\nis no species of _Primula_ in South or Central Germany which could be\r\nderived from the beautiful red _Primula farinosa_ of the Alps, but this\r\nspecies occurs also upon the old glacier-soil at the northern base of\r\nthe Alps, and in similar soil again in the north of Germany and on the\r\nmeadows of Holstein. Similar examples might be cited in regard to the\r\nAlpine-Arctic butterflies.\r\n\r\nIt is intelligible enough that we are still very far from being able\r\nto give a precise account of the main changes in the plant and animal\r\nworld during the history of the earth in regard to the special causes\r\nwhich have produced them. Possibly the future will throw more light\r\nupon this subject by extending our knowledge of the fossil remains\r\nof all countries. But so much at least we can say at present, that\r\nthere is no reason to refer the dying out of the earlier forms to\r\nanything else than the changes in the conditions of life, the struggle\r\nfor existence, and the limitation of the power of transformation and\r\nadaptation due to the organization which the species has already\r\nattained; there is no trace of any such thing as a phyletic principle\r\nof life in the vitalistic sense, as far as the decadence of species is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXXVI\r\n\r\nSPONTANEOUS GENERATION AND EVOLUTION: CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n Spontaneous generation--Experimental tests impossible--Only the\r\n lowest and smallest forms of life can be referred to spontaneous\r\n generation--Chemical postulates for spontaneous generation--Empedocles\r\n modernized--The locality of spontaneous generation--Progress of\r\n organization--Direct and indirect influences causing variation--The\r\n various modes of selection--Everything depends upon selection--Sinking\r\n from heights of organization already attained--Paths of evolution--The\r\n forces effecting it--Plasticity of living matter--Predetermination\r\n of the animate world--Many-sided adaptation of each group--Aquatic\r\n mammals and insects, parasites--Nägeli's variation in a definite\r\n direction--Analogy of the traveller--Genealogical trees--The\r\n diversity of forms of life is unlimited--The origin of the purposeful\r\n apart from purposive forces working towards an end--The limits of\r\n knowledge--Limitation of the human intelligence by selection--Human\r\n genius--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the end of our studies, and they have given us\r\nsatisfaction, at least in so far that they have brought us certainty\r\nin regard to the chief and fundamental question which can be asked in\r\nreference to the origin of the modern animate world of organisms. There\r\nremains no doubt in our minds that the theory of descent is justified;\r\nwe know, just as surely as that the earth goes round the sun, that the\r\nliving world upon our earth was not created all at once and in the\r\nstate in which we know it, but that it has gradually evolved through\r\nwhat, to our human estimate, seem enormously long periods of time.\r\nThis conclusion is now firmly established and will never again become\r\ndoubtful. The assumption, too, that the more lowly organisms formed\r\nthe beginnings of life, and that an ascent has taken place from the\r\nlowest to the higher and highest, has become to our minds a probability\r\nverging upon certainty. But there remains one point which we have not\r\nyet touched upon--the problem of the origin of these first organisms.\r\n\r\nThere are only two possibilities: either that they have been borne to\r\nour earth from outside, from somewhere else in the universe, or that\r\nthey have originated upon our earth itself through what is called\r\n'spontaneous generation'--_generatio spontanea_.\r\n\r\nThe idea that very lowly living organisms might have been concealed\r\nwithin the clefts and crevices of meteorites, and might thus have\r\nfallen upon our earth and so have formed the first germs of life, was\r\nfirst formulated by that chemical genius, Justus Liebig. It seems\r\ncertain that the state of glowing heat in which meteorites are, when\r\nthey come into our atmosphere, only affects the outer crust of these\r\ncosmic fragments, and that living germs, which might be concealed in\r\nthe depths of their crevices and fissures, might therefore remain\r\nalive, but nevertheless it is undoubtedly impossible that any germ\r\nshould reach us alive in this way, because it could neither endure\r\nthe excessive cold nor the absolute desiccation to which it would be\r\nexposed in cosmic space, which contains absolutely no water. This could\r\nnot be endured even for a few days, much less for immeasurable periods\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nBut we have to take account, too, of an entirely general reason,\r\nwhich lies in the fact that all life is transient, that it can be\r\nannihilated, and is not merely mortal! Everything that is distinctively\r\norganic may be destroyed to the extent of becoming inorganic. Not\r\nonly may the phenomena of life disappear, and the living body as such\r\ncease to be, but the organic compounds which form the physical basis\r\nof all life are ceaselessly breaking up, and they fall back by stages\r\nto the level of the inorganic. It seems to me that we must necessarily\r\nconclude from this that the basis of Liebig's idea was incorrect, that\r\nis, the assumption that 'organic substances are everlasting and have\r\nexisted from the first just in the same way as inorganic substances.'\r\nThis is obviously not the case, for a thing that has an end cannot be\r\neverlasting; it must have had a beginning too, and consequently organic\r\ncombinations are not everlasting, but are transitory; they come and\r\ngo, they arise wherever the conditions suitable for them occur, and\r\nthey break up into simpler combinations when these conditions cease\r\nto be present. It is only the elements which are eternal, not their\r\ncombinations, for these are subject to more or less rapid continual\r\nchange, whether they have arisen outside of organisms or within them.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that these considerations destroy the foundations of\r\nthe hypothesis of the cosmic origin of life on our earth; in any case\r\nthey leave the hypothesis without great significance; for if we could\r\neven admit the possibility of a transference of living organisms from\r\nspace, the question would only be pushed a little further back by the\r\nassumption, and not solved, for the organisms thus brought in must have\r\nhad their origin on some other planet, since they are, _ex hypothesi_,\r\nnot everlasting.\r\n\r\nThus we are directed to our earth itself as the place of the origin\r\nof the tellurian world of life, and I see no possibility of avoiding\r\nthe assumption of _spontaneous generation_. It is for me a logical\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nEven about the middle of the nineteenth century there was acute\r\ndiscussion in regard to the occurrence of spontaneous generation. In\r\nthe French Academy especially Pouchet brought forward arguments in\r\nfavour of it, and Pasteur against it. Pouchet observed that living\r\norganisms made their appearance in infusions of hay and other vegetable\r\nmaterial in which any possible living germs had presumably been\r\ndestroyed by prolonged boiling. Living organisms, Algæ, and Infusorians\r\nappeared, notwithstanding the fact that the glass bottles in which\r\nthey were kept were hermetically sealed. But Pasteur showed that the\r\nair contains numerous living germs of lowly organisms in its so-called\r\nmotes, and that, if these were first removed, Pouchet's infusion would\r\nnot exhibit any signs of life. He caused the air, which was continually\r\npassed through the tubes, to stream first along the heated barrel of\r\na gun, and so destroyed these germs, and no organisms were obtained\r\nin the infusions. He showed that the air is teeming with germs by an\r\nexperiment with boiled infusions which were allowed to lie undisturbed\r\nfor a considerable time in bottles with open necks, one on the roof\r\nof the Institute at Paris, the other on the top of the Puy de Dôme in\r\nAuvergne, which was at that time still the highest mountain in France.\r\nIn the Parisian experiment, organisms appeared in the bottles in a very\r\nfew days, while in those exposed to the pure air at the mountain-top\r\nnone were seen, even after months had elapsed.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, these and similar experiments were at the time\r\nregarded as conclusive proof against the existence of spontaneous\r\ngeneration, though it is obvious enough that the first living being\r\non this earth cannot have sprung from hay, or from any other organic\r\nsubstance, since that would presuppose what we are attempting to\r\nexplain. After the fiery earth had so far cooled that its outermost\r\nlayer had hardened to a firm crust, and after water had condensed to a\r\nliquid form, there could at first only have been inorganic substances\r\nin existence. In order to prove spontaneous generation, therefore,\r\nit would be necessary to try to find out from what mingling of\r\ninorganic combinations organisms could arise; to prove that spontaneous\r\ngeneration could never have been possible is out of the question.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to prove by experiment that spontaneous\r\ngeneration could _never_ have taken place; because each negative\r\nexperiment would only prove that life does not arise _under the\r\nconditions of the experiment_. But this by no means excludes the\r\npossibility that it might arise under other conditions.\r\n\r\nUp till now all attempts to discover these conditions have been futile,\r\nand I do not believe that they will ever be successful, not because the\r\nconditions must be so peculiar in nature that we cannot reproduce them,\r\nbut above all, because we should not be able to perceive the results\r\nof a successful experiment. I shall be able to prove this convincingly\r\nwithout difficulty.\r\n\r\nIf we ask ourselves the question how the living beings which might have\r\narisen through spontaneous generation must be constituted, and on the\r\nother hand, in regard to what kinds of living forms we can maintain\r\nwith certainty that they _could not_ have arisen thus, it is obvious\r\nthat we must place on the latter list all organisms which presuppose\r\nthe existence of others, from which they have been derived. But to\r\nthis category belong all the organisms which possess a germ-plasm,\r\nan idioplasm that we conceive of as composed of primary constituents\r\n(_Anlagen_) which have gradually been evolved and accumulated through\r\na long series of ancestors. Thus not only all multicellular animals\r\nand plants which reproduce by means of germ-cells, buds, and so forth,\r\nbut also all unicellular organisms, must be placed in this class. For\r\nthese last--as we have seen--possess in their nucleus a substance made\r\nup of primary constituents, without which the mutilated body is unable\r\nto make good its loss, in short, an idioplasm. That this plays the same\r\nrôle in unicellular as in multicellular organisms we can infer with\r\nthe greatest certainty from the process of amphimixis, which runs its\r\ncourse in an analogous way in both cases.\r\n\r\nThus, even though we did not know what Ehrenberg demonstrated in the\r\nthird decade of last century, that Infusorians in an encapsuled state\r\ncan be blown about everywhere, and can even be carried across the\r\nocean in the dust of the trade-winds, to re-awaken to life wherever\r\nthey fall into fresh water, we should still not have remained at the\r\nstandpoint of Leuwenhoek, who regarded Infusorians as having arisen\r\nthrough spontaneous generation. They cannot arise in this way, nor can\r\nthey have done so at any time, because they contain a substance made\r\nup of primary constituents, which can only be of historic origin, and\r\ncannot therefore have arisen suddenly after the manner of a chemical\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of all the unicellular organisms, even of those\r\nwhich are much more simple in structure than the Infusorians, whose\r\ndifferentiation into cortical and medullary substances, oral and anal\r\nopenings, complex arrangements of cilia and much else, betokens a high\r\ndegree of differentiation in the cell. But even the Amœba is only\r\napparently simple, for otherwise it could not send out processes and\r\nretract them again, creep in a particular direction, encyst itself,\r\nand so on, for all this presupposes a differentiation of its particles\r\nin different directions, and a definite arrangement of them; and\r\nthere is in addition the marvellous dividing-apparatus of the nucleus\r\nwhich is not wanting even in the Amœba. All this again points to a\r\nhistoric evolution, a gradual acquiring and an orderly arrangement of\r\ndifferentiations, and such an organism cannot have arisen suddenly like\r\na crystal or a chemical combination.\r\n\r\nThus we are driven back to the lowest known organisms, and the question\r\nnow before us is whether these smallest living organisms, which are\r\nonly visible under the highest powers of the microscope, may be\r\nreferred to spontaneous generation. But here too the answer is, No; for\r\nalthough there is no nucleus to be found, and no substance which we\r\ncan affirm with any certainty to be composed of primary constituents\r\nor idioplasm, we do find distinct traces of a previous history, and\r\nnot the absolutely simple structure of homogeneous living particles,\r\nunarranged in any orderly way, which is all that could be derived from\r\nspontaneous generation. It has been shown quite recently that the\r\ntyphus bacillus possesses an extremely delicate much-branched tuft\r\nof flagella, which gives it a tremulous motion, and in the cholera\r\nbacillus cortical and medullary substances can be distinguished. Thus\r\neven here there is differentiation according to the principle of\r\ndivision of labour, and how numerous must be the minute vital particles\r\nof which a substance consists when it can form such fine threads as the\r\nflagella just mentioned! Nägeli, who elaborated an analogous train of\r\nthought in regard to spontaneous generation, calculated the number of\r\nthese smallest vital particles (his 'micellæ') which must be contained\r\nin a 'moneron' of 0.6 mm. diameter, if we take its dry substance at\r\n10 per cent., and he arrived at the amazing figure of 100 billions of\r\nvital particles. Even if we suppose the diameter of such an organism\r\nto be 0.0006 mm., it would still be composed, according to this\r\ncalculation, of a million of these vital particles.\r\n\r\nWe have reached, in the course of these lectures, the conviction\r\nthat minute living units form the basis of all organisms, namely,\r\nour 'life-bearers' or 'biophors.' These must be present in countless\r\nmultitudes, and in a great number of varieties in the different forms\r\nof life, but all agree in this, that they are simple, that is, they are\r\nnot composed in their turn of living particles, but only of molecules,\r\nwhose chemical constitution, combination, and arrangement are such as\r\nto give rise to the phenomena of life. But they may vary, and on this\r\npower depends the possibility of their differentiation, which has\r\ntaken place in more and more diverse ways in the course of phylogeny.\r\nThey, too, arise in the existing organism, like all vital units, only\r\nby multiplication of the biophors already present, but they do not\r\nnecessarily presuppose a historic origin; it is conceivable of them,\r\nat least as far as their first and simplest forms are concerned, that\r\nthey may have arisen some time or other through spontaneous generation.\r\nIn regard to them alone is the possibility of origin through purely\r\nchemico-physical causes, without the co-operation of life already\r\nexisting, admissible. It is only in regard to them that spontaneous\r\ngeneration is not inconceivable.\r\n\r\nWe must, therefore, assume that, at some time or other in the history\r\nof the earth, the conditions necessary to the development of these\r\ninvisible little living particles must have existed, and that the whole\r\nsubsequent development of the organic world must have depended upon an\r\naggregation of these biophors into larger complexes, and upon their\r\ndifferentiation within these complexes.\r\n\r\nWe shall never be able, then, directly to observe spontaneous\r\ngeneration, for the simple reason that the smallest and lowest living\r\nparticles which could arise through it, the Biophoridæ, are so\r\nextremely far below the limits of visibility, that there is no hope\r\nof our ever being able to perceive them, even if we should succeed in\r\nproducing them by spontaneous generation.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to discuss the chemical problem raised by the possible\r\noccurrence of spontaneous generation. We have already seen that dead\r\nprotoplasm, in addition to water, salts, phosphorus, sulphur, and some\r\nother elements, chiefly and invariably contains albumen; an albuminoid\r\nsubstance must, therefore, have arisen from inorganic combinations.\r\nNo one will maintain that this is impossible, for we continually see\r\nalbuminoid substances produced in plants from inorganic substances,\r\ncompounds of carbon and nitrogen; but under what conditions this would\r\nbe possible in free nature, that is, outside of organisms, cannot as\r\nyet be determined. Possibly we may some time succeed in procuring\r\nalbumen from inorganic substances in the laboratory, and if that\r\nhappens the theory of spontaneous generation will rest upon a firmer\r\nbasis, but it will not have been experimentally proved even then.\r\nFor while dead albumen is certainly nearly allied to living matter,\r\nit is precisely _life_ that it lacks, and as yet we do not know what\r\nkinds of chemical difference prevail between the dead proteid and the\r\nliving; indeed we must honestly confess that it is a mere assumption\r\nwhen we take for granted that there are only chemico-physical\r\ndifferences between the two. It cannot be proved, in the meantime,\r\nthat there is not another unknown power in the living protoplasm,\r\na 'vitalistic principle,' a 'life-force,' on the activity of which\r\nthese specific phenomena of life, and particularly the continually\r\nrepeated alternation of disruption and reconstruction of the living\r\nsubstance, dissimilation and assimilation, growth and multiplication,\r\ndepend. It is just as difficult to prove the converse, that it is\r\nimpossible that chemico-physical forces alone should have called forth\r\nlife in a chemical substance of very special composition. Although\r\nno one has ever succeeded, in spite of many attempts, in thinking\r\nout a combination of chemical substances which--as this wonderful\r\nliving substance does--on the one hand undergoes combustion with\r\noxygen and, on the other hand, renews itself again with 'nutritive'\r\nmaterial, yet we cannot infer from this the impossibility of a purely\r\nchemico-physical basis of life, but must rather hold fast to it until\r\nit is shown that it is not sufficient to explain the facts, thus\r\nfollowing the fundamental rule that natural science must not assume\r\nunknown forces until the known ones are _proved_ insufficient. If\r\nwe were to do otherwise we should have to renounce all hope of ever\r\npenetrating deeper into the phenomena. And we have no need to do\r\nthis, for in a general way we can quite well believe that an organic\r\nsubstance of exactly proportioned composition exists, in which the\r\nfundamental phenomena of all life--combustion with simultaneous\r\nrenewal--must take place under certain conditions by virtue of its\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nHow, and under what external conditions, such a substance first arose\r\nupon the earth, from and of what materials it was formed, cannot\r\nbe answered with any certainty in the meantime. Who knows whether\r\nthe fantastic ideas of Empedocles in an altered form would not be\r\njustified here? I mean that, at the time of the first origin of\r\nlife, the conditions necessary for many kinds of complex chemical\r\ncombinations may have been present simultaneously on the earth, and\r\nthat, out of a manifold variety of such substances, only those survived\r\nwhich possessed that marvellous composition which conditioned their\r\ncontinual combustion, but also their ceaseless reconstruction by\r\nmultiplication. According to Empedocles, there arose from chaos only\r\nparts of animals--heads without bodies, arms without trunks, eyes\r\nwithout faces, and so on--and these whirled about in wild confusion\r\nand flew together as chance directed them. But those only survived\r\nwhich had united rightly with others so as to form a whole, capable of\r\nlife. Translated into the language of our time, that would mean what I\r\nhave just said--that, of a large number of organic combinations which\r\narose, only a few, perhaps one, would possess the marvellously adjusted\r\ncomposition which resulted in life, and with it self-maintenance and\r\nmultiplication; and that would be the first instance of selection!\r\n\r\nBut let us leave these imaginings, and wait to see whether the chemists\r\nwill not possibly be able to furnish us with a starting-point for a\r\nmore concrete picture of the first origin of life. In the meantime, we\r\nmust confess that we find ourselves confronted with deep darkness.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the 'Where' of spontaneous generation must also be\r\nleft without any definite answer. Some have supposed that life began\r\nin the depths of the sea, others on the shore, and others in the air.\r\nBut who is to divine this, when we cannot even name theoretically the\r\nconditions and the materials out of which albuminoid-like substances\r\nmight be built up in the laboratory? Nägeli's hypothesis still seems\r\nto me to have the greatest probability. According to his theory, the\r\nfirst living particles originated not in a free mass of water, but in\r\nthe reticulated superficial layer of a fine porous substance (clay or\r\nsand), where the molecular forces of solid, fluid, and gaseous bodies\r\nwere able to co-operate.\r\n\r\nOnly so much is certain, that wherever life may first have arisen upon\r\nthis earth, it can have done so only in the form of the very simple\r\nand very minute vital units, which even now we only infer to be parts\r\nof the living body, but which must first have arisen as independent\r\norganisms, the 'Biophoridæ.' As these, according to our theory,\r\npossessed the character of life, they must have possessed above all the\r\ncapacity of assimilating in the sense in which the plants assimilate,\r\nthat is, of renewing their bodily substance continually from inorganic\r\nsubstances, of growing, and of reproducing. They need not on that\r\naccount have possessed the chemical constitution of chlorophyll,\r\nalthough the capacity of assimilation in green plants depends upon this\r\nsubstance, for we know colourless fungi, which, notwithstanding the\r\nabsence of chlorophyll, are able to build up the substance of their\r\nbody from compounds of carbon and nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe first advance to a higher stage of life must have been brought\r\nabout by multiplication, since accumulations of Biophoridæ,\r\nunintegrated but connected masses, would be formed.\r\n\r\nIn this way the threshold of microscopical visibility would gradually\r\nbe reached and crossed, but--to argue from the modern Baccilli--long\r\nbefore that time a differentiation of the biophors on the principle\r\nof division of labour would have taken place within a colony of\r\nBiophoridæ. This first step towards higher organization must probably\r\nhave taken enormous periods of time, for before any differentiation\r\ncould occur and bring any advantage the unintegrated aggregates of\r\nBiophors must first have become orderly, and have formed themselves\r\ninto a stable association with definite form and definite structure,\r\nsomewhat analogous to the spherical cell-colonies of _Magosphæra_ or\r\n_Pandorina_. Only then was the further step made of a differentiation\r\nof the individual biophors forming the colony, and this is comparable\r\nto the species of _Volvox_ among the lower Algæ. The gradual ascent of\r\nthese colonies of biophors must, then, be referred to the principles\r\nto which we attribute the ascent of the higher forms of life to\r\never-higher and ever-new differentiations; the principles of division\r\nof labour and selection.\r\n\r\nThese differentiated colonies of biophors have brought us nearer to the\r\nlowest known organisms, among which there are some whose existence we\r\ncan only infer from their pathological effects, since we have not been\r\nable to make them visible. The bacillus of measles has never yet been\r\nseen, but we cannot doubt its existence, and we must assume that there\r\nare bacilli of such exceeding smallness that we shall never be able\r\nto see them, even with the most improved methods of staining and the\r\nstrongest lenses.\r\n\r\nThese non-nucleated Monera lead on to the stage of nucleus-formation,\r\nand this at once implies the cell. As, on our view, the nucleus is\r\nprimarily a storehouse of 'primary constituents' (_Anlagen_), its\r\norigin must have begun at the moment at which the differentiation of\r\nthe cell-body reached such a degree of differentiation of its parts\r\nthat a mechanical division into two halves was no longer possible, and\r\nthat the two products of division, if they were each to develop to\r\na new and intact whole, required a reserve of primordia (_Anlagen_)\r\nto give rise to the missing parts. As this higher differentiation\r\nwould bring about a superiority over the lower forms of life, in that\r\nthey would make possible the utilization of new conditions of life,\r\nbut on the other hand could only survive if the differentiation of a\r\nreserve of primary constituents, that is, a nucleus, were introduced\r\nat the same time, the development of the nucleus can be ranged under\r\nthe principle of utility to which we traced back the evolution of all\r\nhigher and more differentiated forms of life. But it would scarcely\r\nbe profitable to try to follow out in detail the first steps in the\r\nprogress of organization under the control of selective processes,\r\nsince we know far too little about the life of the simplest organisms\r\nto be able to judge how far their differentiations are of use in\r\nimproving their capacity for life.\r\n\r\nThat would be a bold undertaking even in regard to unicellular\r\norganisms, and it is only in the case of multicellular organisms that\r\nwe can speak with greater certainty and really recognize the changing\r\nof the external conditions, in the most general and comprehensive\r\nsense, as the fundamental cause of the lasting variations of organic\r\nforms. We can here distinguish with certainty between the direct and\r\nthe indirect effect of external influences, and we see how these\r\nsources of variation interact upon each other. The lowest and deepest\r\nroot of variation is without doubt the direct effect of changed\r\nconditions. Without this the indirect effect would have had no lever\r\nwith which to work, for the primitive beginnings of variation would be\r\nabsent, and an accumulation of these through personal selection could\r\nnot take place. It is a primitive character of living substance to be\r\nvariable, that is, to be able to respond to some extent to changed\r\nexternal conditions, and to vary in accordance with them, or--as we\r\nmight also say--to be able to exist in many very similar but not\r\nidentical combinations of substances, and we must imagine that even\r\nthe first biophors which arose through spontaneous generation were\r\ndifferent according to the conditions under which, and the substances\r\nfrom which, they originated. And from each of these slightly different\r\nbeginnings there must, in the course of multiplication by fission,\r\nhave been produced a whole genealogical tree of divergent variations\r\nof the primitive Biophoridæ, since it is inconceivable that all the\r\ndescendants would remain constantly under the same conditions of\r\nlife under which they originated. For every persistent change in\r\nthe conditions of existence, and especially of nutrition, must have\r\ninvolved a variation in the constitution of the organism, whose vital\r\nprocesses, and especially the repair of its body, depended on these\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nBut the external influences to which the descendants of a particular\r\nform of life were subject never remained permanently the same. Not\r\nonly did the surface of the earth and its climatic conditions change\r\nin the course of time with the cooling of the earth, but mountains\r\narose and were levelled again, old land-surfaces sank out of sight or\r\nemerged again, and so on; all that, of course, played its part in the\r\ntransformation of the forms of life, but did so to any considerable\r\nextent only at a later stage, when there were already highly\r\ndifferentiated organisms. These unknown primitive beginnings of life\r\nmust have been forced to diverge into different variations through the\r\ndifferent conditions of the same place in which they lived.\r\n\r\nLet us think of the simplest microscopic Monera on the mud of the\r\nsea-coast, equipped with the faculty of plant-like assimilation, and we\r\nshall see that their unlimited multiplication would cause differences\r\nin nutrition, for those lying uppermost would be in a stronger light\r\nthan those below, and would, therefore, be better nourished, and,\r\nconsequently, would transmit the variations thus induced to their\r\nprogeny which arose by fission. Thus it is conceivable that even the\r\nmore or less favourable position as regards light would bring about the\r\norigin of two different races from the same parent form, and as it is\r\nconceivable in the case of light, so is it also in regard to all the\r\ninfluences which cause variation in the organism.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that variations in the lowest (non-nucleated)\r\nforms of life caused by the direct influence of the vital processes\r\nmay be directly transmitted to the descendants, but that in all\r\nthose whose bodies have already differentiated into a germ- or\r\nidioplasmic-substance, in contrast to a somatic substance in the more\r\nrestricted sense, this hereditary transmission is only possible in the\r\ncase of the variations of the germ-plasm, and _hereditary_ variations\r\nof the species can only arise by the circuitous route of influencing\r\nthe germ-plasm. The body (soma) can be caused to change by external\r\ninfluences, by the use or disuse of an organ, but variations of this\r\nkind are not transmitted; they do not become a lasting possession of\r\nthe species, but cease with the individual; they are transient changes.\r\n\r\nThus it was only through those external influences--including\r\nthose from the soma of the organism itself--which affected the\r\ngerm-substance, either as a whole or in certain of its primary\r\nconstituents, that hereditarily transmissible variations of the\r\norganism arose, and we have already discussed in detail how particular\r\nvariational tendencies may arise through the struggle of the parts\r\nwithin the germ-plasm, which may give an advantage to certain groups of\r\nprimary constituents. And these tendencies are of themselves sufficient\r\nto cause the specific type to vary further and further in given\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the infinite diversity of the forms of life could never\r\nhave been brought about in this way alone, if there had not been\r\nanother--the _indirect_--effect of the changeful external influences.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact that the variations of direct origin sooner\r\nor later obtain an influence in determining the viability of their\r\npossessors, either increasing or diminishing it. It is this, in\r\nassociation with the unlimited multiplication of individuals, which\r\ngives a basis to the principle of transformation, which it is the\r\nimmortal merit of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace to have\r\nintroduced into science: _the principle of selection_. We have seen\r\nthat this principle may have a much more comprehensive meaning than\r\nwas attributed to it by either of these two naturalists; that there\r\nis not merely a struggle between individuals which brings about their\r\nadaptation to their environment, by preserving those which vary in\r\nthe most favourable way and rejecting those which vary unfavourably,\r\nbut that there is an analogous struggle between the parts of these\r\nindividuals, which, as Wilhelm Roux showed, effects the adaptation\r\nof the parts to their functions, and that this struggle must be\r\nassumed to occur even between the determinants and biophors of the\r\ngerm-plasm. There is thus a germinal selection, a competition between\r\nthe smaller and larger particles of the germ-plasm for space and\r\nfood, and that it is through this struggle that there arise those\r\ndefinitely and purposefully directed variations of the individual,\r\nwhich are transmissible because they have their seat in the immortal\r\ngerm-plasm, and without which an adaptation of individuals in the sense\r\nand to the extent in which we actually observe it would be altogether\r\ninconceivable. I have endeavoured to show that the whole evolution\r\nof the living world is guided essentially by processes of selection,\r\nin as far as adaptations of the parts to one another, and of the\r\nwhole to the conditions of life, cannot be conceived of as possible\r\nexcept through these, and that all fluctuations of the organism,\r\nfrom the very lowest up to the highest, are forced into particular\r\npaths by this principle, by 'the survival of the fittest.' This ends\r\nthe whole dispute as to whether there are indifferent 'characters'\r\nwhich have no influence on the existence of the species, for even the\r\ncharacters most indifferent for the 'person' would not exist unless\r\nthe germinal constituents (determinants) which condition them had\r\nbeen victorious in the struggle for existence over others of their\r\nkind, and even the 'indifferent' characters, which depend solely\r\nupon climatic or other external influences, owe their existence to\r\nprocesses of germinal selection, for those elements of the determinants\r\nconcerned were victorious which throve best under such influences.\r\nBut should variations thus produced by external influence increase so\r\nfar that they become prejudicial to the survival of their bearers,\r\nthen they are either set aside by personal selection or, if that be\r\nno longer possible, they lead to the extinction of the species. Thus\r\nthe multitude of small individual variations, which probably occur in\r\nevery species, but which strike us most in Man--the differences in the\r\ndevelopment of mouth, nose, and eyes, in the hair, in the colour of\r\nskin, &c., as far as they are without significance in the struggle for\r\nexistence--depend upon processes of germinal selection, which permitted\r\nthe greater development of one group of determinants, or of one kind of\r\nbiophor in one case, of another in another. The proportionate strength\r\nof the elements of the germ-plasm is not readily lost at once, but is\r\nhanded on to successive generations, and thus even these 'indifferent'\r\ncharacters are transmitted.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that, if the principle of selection operates in nature\r\nat all, it must do so wherever living units struggle together for the\r\nsame requirements of life, for space and food, and these units need not\r\nbe persons, but may represent every category of vital units, from the\r\nsmallest invisible units up to the largest. For in all these cases the\r\nconditions of the selection-process are given: individual variability,\r\nnutrition, and multiplication, transmission of the advantage\r\nattained, and, on the other hand, limitation of the conditions of\r\nexistence--especially food and space. The resulting struggle for\r\nexistence must, in every category of vital units, be most acute\r\nbetween the individual members of each category, as Darwin emphasized\r\nin the case of species from the very first, and persistent variations\r\nof a species of living units can only be brought about by this kind\r\nof struggle. Strictly speaking, therefore, we should distinguish as\r\nmany kinds of selection-processes as there are categories of living\r\nunits, and these could not be sharply separated from one another,\r\napart from the fact that we have to infer many of them, and cannot\r\nrecognize their gradations. Here, as everywhere else, we must break up\r\nthe continuity of nature into artificial groups, and it seems best to\r\nassume and distinguish between four main grades of selective processes\r\ncorresponding to the most outstanding and significant categories of\r\nvital units, namely: Germinal, Histonal, Personal, and Cormal Selection.\r\n\r\nHistonal Selection includes all the processes of selection which take\r\nplace between the elements of the body (soma), as distinguished from\r\nthe germ-plasm, of the Metazoa and Metaphyta, not only between the\r\n'tissues' in the stricter sense, but also between the parts of the\r\ntissues, that is, the lower vital units of which they are composed, and\r\nwhich Wilhelm Roux, when he published his _Kampf der Teile_ ('Struggle\r\nof the Parts'), called 'molecules.' It occurs between all the parts\r\nof the tissues down to the lowest vital units, the biophors. We must\r\nalso reckon under histonal selection the processes of selection\r\nwhich take place between the elements of the simplest organisms, and\r\nthrough which these have gradually attained to greater complexity of\r\nstructure and increased functional capacity. As long as no special\r\nhereditary substance had been differentiated, variations which arose\r\nin the simplest organisms through selection-processes of this kind\r\nwere necessarily transmitted to the descendants, but after this\r\ndifferentiation had taken place this could no longer occur--'acquired'\r\nmodifications of the soma were no longer transmitted, and the\r\nimportance of histonal selection was limited to the individual. But\r\nthis form of selection must be of the greatest importance in regard to\r\nthe adaptations of the parts which develop from the ovum, especially\r\nduring the course of development, and it is also indispensable all\r\nthrough life in maintaining the equilibrium of the parts, and their\r\nadaptation to the varying degree of function required from them (use\r\nand disuse). But its influence does not reach directly beyond the\r\nlife of the individual, since it can only give rise to 'transient'\r\nmodifications, that is, to changes which cease with the individual life.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this is Germinal Selection, which depends upon the\r\nstruggle of the parts of the germ-plasm, and thus only occurs in\r\norganisms with differentiation of somatoplasm and germ-plasm,\r\nespecially in all Metazoa and Metaphyta--forming in these the basis of\r\nall hereditary variations. But not every individual variation to which\r\ngerminal selection gives rise persists and spreads gradually over the\r\nwhole species, for, apart from the cases we have already mentioned, in\r\nwhich indifferent variations favoured by external circumstances gain\r\nthe victory, this happens only if the variations in question are of use\r\nto their bearer, the individual. Any variation whatever may arise in a\r\nparticular individual purely through germinal selection, but it is only\r\nthe higher form of selection--Personal Selection--that decides whether\r\nthe variation is to persist and to spread to many descendants so that\r\nit ultimately becomes the common property of the species. Germinal and\r\npersonal selection are thus continually interacting, so that germinal\r\nselection continually presents hereditary variations, and personal\r\nselection rejects those that are detrimental and accepts those that\r\nare useful. I will not repeat any exposition of the marvellous way in\r\nwhich personal selection reacts upon germinal selection, and prevents\r\nit from continuing to offer unfavourable variations, and compels it to\r\ngive rise to what is favourable in ever-increasing potency. Although\r\nit apparently selects only the best-adapted _persons_ for breeding,\r\nit really selects the favourable id-combinations of the germ-plasm,\r\nthat is, those which contain the greatest number of favourably varying\r\ndeterminants. We saw that this depends upon the multiplicity of ids\r\nin the germ-plasm, since every primary constituent of the body is\r\nrepresented in the germ-plasm, not once only, but many times, and it is\r\nalways half of the homologous determinants contained in the germ-plasm\r\nof an individual which reach each of its germ-cells, always, moreover,\r\nin a different combination. Thus, with the rejection of an individual\r\nby personal selection, a particular combination of ids, a particular\r\nkind of germ-plasm is in reality removed, and thus prevented from\r\nhaving any further influence upon the evolution of the species. By\r\nthis means germinal selection itself is ultimately influenced, because\r\nonly those ids remain unrejected in the germ-plasm whose determinants\r\nare varying in directions useful to the species. Thus there comes about\r\nwhat until recently was believed to be impossible: the conditions\r\nof life give rise to useful directions of variation, not directly,\r\ncertainly, but indirectly.\r\n\r\nWe may distinguish as a fourth grade of selection Cormal Selection,\r\nthat is, the process of selection which effects the adaptation of\r\nanimal and plant stocks or corms, and which depends on the struggle of\r\nthe colonies among themselves. This differs from personal selection\r\nonly in that it decides, not the fitness of the individual person, but\r\nthat of the stock as a whole. It is a matter of indifference whether\r\nthe stocks concerned are stocks in the actual material sense, or only\r\nin the metaphorical sense of sharing the common life of a large family\r\nseparated by division of labour. In both cases, in the polyp-stock as\r\nwell as in the termite or ant-colony, the collective germ-plasm, with\r\nall its different personal forms, is what is rejected or accepted. The\r\ndistinction between this cormal selection and personal selection is,\r\ntherefore, no very deep one, because here too it is in the long run the\r\ntwo sexual animals which are selected, not indeed only in reference\r\nto their visible features, but also in reference to their invisible\r\ncharacters, those, namely, which determine in their germ-plasm the\r\nconstitution of their neuter progeny or, in the case of polyps, their\r\nasexually reproducing descendants.\r\n\r\nWe venture to maintain that everything in the world of organisms that\r\nhas permanence and significance depends upon adaptation, and has arisen\r\nthrough a sifting of the variations which presented themselves, that\r\nis, through selection. Everything is adaptation, from the smallest\r\nand simplest up to the largest and most complex, for if it were not\r\nit could not endure, but would perish. The principle which Empedocles\r\nannounced, in his own peculiar and fantastic way, is the dominating\r\none, and I must insist upon what has so often been objected to as an\r\nexaggeration--that everything depends upon adaptation and is governed\r\nby processes of selection. From the first beginnings of life, up to\r\nits highest point, only what is purposeful has arisen, because the\r\nliving units at every grade are continually being sifted according to\r\ntheir utility, and the ceaseless struggle for existence is continually\r\nproducing and favouring the fittest. Upon this depends not only the\r\ninfinite diversity of the forms of life, but also, and chiefly, the\r\nclosely associated progress of organization.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be proved in regard to each individual case, but it can be\r\nshown in the main that attaining a higher stage in organization also\r\nimplies a predominance in the struggle for existence, because it opens\r\nup new possibilities of life, adaptations to situations not previously\r\nutilizable, sources of food, or places of refuge. Thus a number of the\r\nlower vertebrates ascended from the water to the land, and adapted\r\nthemselves to life on dry land or in the air, first as clumsily moving\r\nsalamanders, but later as actively leaping frogs; thus, too, other\r\ndescendants of the fishes gained a sufficient carrying power of limbs\r\nto raise the lightened body from the ground, and so attained to the\r\nrapid walk of the lizards, the lightning-like leaps of the arboreal\r\nagamas, the brief swooping of the flying-dragons, and ultimately\r\nthe continuous flight which we find in the flying Saurians and the\r\nprimitive birds of the Jurassic period, and in the birds and bats of\r\nour own day.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that each of these groups, as it originated, conquered\r\na new domain of life, and in many cases this was such a vast one, and\r\ncontained so many special possibilities, that numerous subordinate\r\nadaptations took place, and the group broke up into many species and\r\ngenera, even into families and orders. All this did not come about\r\nbecause of some definitely directed principle of evolution of a\r\nmysterious nature, which impelled them to vary in this direction and in\r\nno other, but solely through the rivalry of all the forms of life and\r\nliving units, with their enormous and ceaseless multiplication, in the\r\nstruggle for existence. They were, and they are still, forced to adapt\r\nthemselves to every new possibility of life attainable to them; they\r\nare able to do this because of the power of the lowest vital units of\r\nthe germ to develop numerous variations; and they are obliged to do it\r\nbecause, of the endless number of descendants from every grade of vital\r\nunit, it is only the fittest which survive.\r\n\r\nThus higher types branched off from the lower from time to time,\r\nalthough the parent type did not necessarily disappear; indeed it\r\ncould not have disappeared as long as the conditions of its life\r\nendured; it was only the superfluous members of the parent form that\r\nadapted themselves to new conditions, and as, in many cases, these\r\nrequired a higher organization, there arose a semblance of general\r\nupward development which simulated a principle of evolution always\r\nupwards. But we know that, at many points on this long road, there\r\nwere stations where individual groups stopped short and dropped back\r\nagain to lower stages of organization. This kind of retreat was almost\r\ninvariably caused by a parasitic habit of life, and in many cases this\r\ndegeneration has gone so far that it is difficult to recognize the\r\nrelationship of the parasite to the free-living ancestors and nearest\r\nrelatives. Many parasitic Crustaceans, such as the Rhizocephalids,\r\nlack almost all the typical characteristics of the crustacean body,\r\nand dispense not only with segmentation, with head and limbs, but also\r\nwith stomach and intestine. As we have seen, they feed like the lower\r\nfungi, by sucking up the juices of their hosts, by means of root-like\r\noutgrowths from the place where the mouth used to be. Nevertheless,\r\ntheir relationship to the Cirrhipedes can be proved from their larval\r\nstages. There are, however, parasites in the kidneys of cuttlefish--the\r\nDicyemidæ--in regard to which naturalists are even now undecided\r\nwhether they ought to form a lowly class by themselves between\r\nunicellular animals and Metazoa, or whether they have degenerated, by\r\nreason of their parasitism, from the flat worms to a simplicity of\r\nstructure elsewhere unknown. They consist only of a few external cells,\r\nwhich enclose a single large internal cell, possess no organs of any\r\nkind, neither mouth nor intestine, neither nervous system nor special\r\nreproductive organs. But although degeneration cannot be proved in this\r\ncase, it can be in hundreds of other cases with absolute certainty,\r\nas, for instance, in the Crustacea belonging to the order of Copepods,\r\nwhich are parasitic upon fishes, in which we find all possible stages\r\nof degeneration, according to the degree of parasitism, that is, to\r\nthe greater or less degree of dependence upon the host; for organs\r\ndegenerate and disappear in exact proportion to the need for them, and\r\nthey thus show us that degeneration also is under the domination of\r\nadaptation.\r\n\r\nThus retrogressive evolution also is based upon the power of the living\r\nunits to respond to changing influences by variation, and upon the\r\nsurvival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nThe roots of all the transformations of organisms, then, lie in changes\r\nof external conditions. Let us suppose for a moment that these might\r\nhave remained absolutely alike from the epoch of spontaneous generation\r\nonwards, then no variation of any kind and no evolution would have\r\ntaken place. But as this is inconceivable, since even the mere growth\r\nof the first living substance must have exposed the different kinds\r\nof biophors composing it to different influences, variation was\r\ninevitable, and so also was its result--the evolution of an animate\r\nworld of organisms.\r\n\r\nExternal influences had a twofold effect at every stage upon every\r\ngrade of vital unit, namely, that of directly causing variation and\r\nthat of selecting or eliminating. Not only the biophors, but every\r\nstage of their combinations, the histological elements, chlorophyll\r\nbodies, muscle-disks, cells, organs, individuals, and colonies, can\r\nnot only be caused to vary by the external influences to which they\r\nare subjected, but can be guided by these along particular paths of\r\nvariation, so that among the variations which crop up some are better\r\nadapted to the conditions than others, and these thrive better, and\r\nthus alone form the basis of further evolution. In this way definite\r\ntendencies of evolution are produced, which do not move blindly and\r\nrigidly onwards like a locomotive which is bound once for all to the\r\nrailroad, but rather in exact response to the external conditions,\r\nlike an untrammelled pedestrian who makes his way, over hill and dale,\r\nwherever it suits him best.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate forces operative in bringing about this many-sided\r\nevolution are the known--and although we do not recognize it as yet,\r\nperhaps the unknown--chemico-physical forces which certainly work only\r\naccording to laws; and that they are able to accomplish such marvellous\r\nresults is due to the fact that they are associated in peculiar and\r\noften very complex different kinds of combinations, and thus conform\r\nto the same sort of regulated arrangements as those which condition\r\nthe operations of any machine made by man. All complex effects depend\r\nupon a co-operation of forces. This is seen, to begin with, in the\r\nchemical combinations whose characters depend entirely upon the number\r\nand arrangement of the elementary substances of which they consist; the\r\natoms of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, which compose sugar, can also\r\ncombine to form carbonic acid gas and water, or alcohol and carbonic\r\nacid gas; and the same thing is true if we ascend from the most complex\r\nbut still inanimate organic molecules to those chemical combinations\r\nwhich, in a still higher form, condition the phenomena of life, to the\r\nlowest living units, the biophors. Not only do these last differ in\r\nhaving life, but they themselves may appear in numerous combinations,\r\nand can combine among themselves to form higher units, whose characters\r\nand effectiveness will depend upon these combinations. Just as man may\r\nadjust various metallic structures, such as wheels, plates, cylinders,\r\nand mainsprings in the combination which we call a watch, and which\r\nmeasures time for us, so the biophors of different kinds in the living\r\nbody may form combinations of a second, third, &c., degree, which\r\nperform the different functions essential to life, and by virtue of\r\ntheir specific, definite combination of elementary forces.\r\n\r\nBut if it be asked, what replaces human intelligence in these\r\npurposeful combinations of primary forces, we can only answer that\r\nthere is here a self-regulation depending upon the characters of the\r\nprimary vital parts, and this means that these last are caused to vary\r\nby external influences and are selected by external influences, that\r\nis, are chosen for survival or excluded from it. Thus combinations of\r\nliving units must always result which are appropriate to the situation\r\nat the moment, for no others can survive, although, as we have seen,\r\nthey must arise. This is our view of the causes of the evolution of the\r\nworld of organisms; the living substance may be compared to a plastic\r\nmass which is poured out over a wide plain, and in its ceaseless\r\nflowing adapts itself to every unevenness, flows into every hole,\r\ncovers every stone or post, leaving an exact model of it, and all this\r\nsimply by virtue of its constitution, which is at first fluid and then\r\nbecomes solid, and of the form of the surface over which it flows.\r\n\r\nBut it is not merely the surface in our analogy which determines\r\nthe form of the organic world; we must take account not only of the\r\nexternal conditions of existence, but also of the constitution of\r\nthe flowing mass, the living substance itself, at every stage of its\r\nevolution. The combination of living units which forms the organism is\r\ndifferent at each stage, and it is upon this that its further evolution\r\ndepends; this difference determines what its further evolution _may_\r\nbe, but the conditions of life determine what it _must_ be in a\r\nparticular case. Thus, in a certain sense, it was with the first\r\nbiophors, originating through spontaneous generation, that the whole\r\nof the organic world was determined, for their origin involved not\r\nonly the physical constitution by which the variations of the organism\r\nwere limited, but also the external conditions, with their changes up\r\ntill now, to which organisms had to adapt themselves. There can be\r\nno doubt that on another planet with other conditions of life other\r\norganisms would have arisen, and would have succeeded each other in\r\ndiverse series. On the planet Mars, for instance, with its entirely\r\ndifferent conditions as regards the proportions in weight and volume of\r\nthe chemical elements and their combinations, living substance, if it\r\ncould arise at all, would occur in a different chemical composition,\r\nand thus be equipped with different characters, and without doubt\r\nalso with quite different possibilities of further development and\r\ntransformation. The highly evolved world of organisms which we may\r\nsuppose to exist upon Mars, chiefly on the ground of the presence\r\nof the remarkable straight canals discovered by Schiaparelli, must\r\ntherefore be thought of as very different from the terrestrial living\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBut upon the earth things could not have been very different from\r\nwhat they actually are, even if we allow a good deal to chance and\r\nassume that the form of seas and continents might have been quite\r\ndifferent, the folding of the surface into mountains and valleys, and\r\nthe formation of rents and fissures, with the volcanoes that burst\r\nfrom them, need not have turned out exactly as it has done. In that\r\ncase many species would never have arisen, but others would have taken\r\ntheir place; on the whole, the same types of species-groups would\r\nhave succeeded each other in the history of the earth. Let us suppose\r\nthat the Sandwich Islands, like many other submarine volcanoes, had\r\nnever risen above the surface of the sea, then the endemic species of\r\nsnails, birds, and plants which now live there could not have arisen,\r\nand if the volcanic group of the Galapagos Islands had arisen from\r\nthe sea not in their actual situation, but forty degrees further\r\nsouth or north, or 1,000 kilometres further west, then it would have\r\nreceived other colonists, and probably fewer of them, and a different\r\ncompany of endemic species would be found there now. But there would\r\nbe terrestrial snails and land-birds none the less, and on the whole\r\nwe may say that both the extinct and the living groups of organisms\r\nwould have arisen even with different formations of land and sea, of\r\nheights and depths, of climatic changes, of elevations and depressions\r\nof the earth's crust, at least in so far as they are adaptations to\r\nthe more general conditions of life and not to specialized ones. The\r\ngreat adaptation to swimming in the sea, for instance, must have taken\r\nplace in any case; swimming worms, swimming polyps (Medusæ), swimming\r\nvertebrates, would have arisen; terrestrial animals would have evolved\r\nalso, on the one hand from an ancestry of worms in the form of jointed\r\nanimals and land or freshwater worms, and again from an ancestry of\r\nfishes. Aerial animals would also undoubtedly have evolved even if the\r\nlands had been quite differently formed and bounded, and I know of no\r\nreason why the adaptation to flight should not have been attempted in\r\nas many different ways as it has actually been by so many different\r\ngroups--the insects, the reptiles (the flying Saurians of the Jurassic\r\nperiod), the extinct _Archæopteryx_, the birds, and the bats among\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\nWe can trace plainly in every group the attempt not only to spread\r\nitself out as far as possible over as much of the surface of the earth\r\nas is accessible to it, but also to adapt itself to all possible\r\nconditions of life, as far as the capacity for adaptation suffices.\r\nThis is very obvious from the fact that such varied groups have striven\r\nto rise from life on the earth to life in the air, and have succeeded\r\nmore or less perfectly, and we can see the same thing in all manner of\r\ngroups. Almost everywhere we find species and groups of species which\r\nemancipate themselves from the general conditions of life in their\r\nclass, and adapt themselves to very different conditions, to which\r\nthe structure of the class as a whole does not seem in the least\r\nsuited. Thus the mammals are lung-breathers, and their extremities\r\nare obviously adapted for locomotion on the solid earth, yet several\r\ngroups have returned to aquatic life, as, for instance, the family of\r\notters and the orders of seals and whales. Thus among insects which\r\nare adapted for direct air-breathing, certain families and stages\r\nof development have returned to aquatic life, and have developed\r\nbreathing-tubes by means of which they can suck in air from the surface\r\nof the water into their tracheal system, or so-called tracheal gills,\r\ninto which the air from the water diffuses. But the most convincing\r\nproof of the organism's power of adaptation is to be found in the\r\nfact that the possibility of living parasitically within other\r\nanimals is taken advantage of in the fullest manner, and by the most\r\ndiverse groups, and that their bodies exhibit the most marvellous and\r\nfar-reaching adaptations to the special conditions prevailing within\r\nthe bodies of other animals. We have already referred to the high\r\ndegree reached by these adaptive changes, how the parasite may depart\r\nentirely from the type of its family or order, so that its relationship\r\nis difficult to recognize. Not only have numerous species of flat worms\r\nand round worms done this, but we find numerous parasites among the\r\ngreat class of Crustaceans; there are some among spiders, insects,\r\nmedusoids, and snails, and there are even isolated cases among fishes.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the number of obstacles that have to be overcome in\r\nexistence within other animals, and how difficult and how much a matter\r\nof chance it must be even to reach to such a place as, for instance,\r\nthe intestine, the liver, the lungs, or even the brain or the blood of\r\nanother animal, and when, on the other hand, we know how exactly things\r\nare now regulated for every parasitic species so that its existence is\r\nsecured notwithstanding its dependence upon chance, we must undoubtedly\r\nform a high estimate of the plasticity of the forms of life and their\r\nadaptability. And this impression will only be strengthened when we\r\nremember that the majority of internal parasites do not pass directly\r\nfrom one host to another, but do so only through their descendants, and\r\nthat these descendants, too, must undergo the most far-reaching and\r\noften unexpected adaptations in relation to their distribution, their\r\npenetration into a new host, and their migrations and change of form\r\nwithin it, if the existence of the species is to be secured.\r\n\r\nWe are tempted to study these relations more closely; but it is now\r\ntime to sum up, and we must no longer lose ourselves in wealth of\r\ndetail. Moreover, the life-history of many parasites, and of the\r\ntape-worm in particular, is widely known, and any one can easily fill\r\nup the story, of which we have given a mere outline. I simply wish to\r\npoint out that in parasitic animals there is a vast range of forms of\r\nlife in which the most precise adaptation to the conditions occurs\r\nin almost every organ, and certainly at every stage of life, in the\r\nmost conspicuous and distinct manner. In the earlier part of these\r\nlectures we gained from the study of the diverse protective means by\r\nwhich plants and animals secure their existence the impression that\r\nwhatever is suited to its end (_Das Zweckmässige_) does not depend\r\nupon chance for its origin, but that every adaptation which lies at\r\nall within the possibilities of a species will arise if there is any\r\noccasion for it. This impression is notably strengthened when we think\r\nof the life-history of parasites, and we shall find that our view\r\nof adaptations as arising, not through the selection of indefinite\r\nvariations, but through that of variations in a definite direction,\r\nwill be confirmed. Adaptations so diverse, and succeeding one another\r\nin such an unfailing order as those in the life-history of a tape-worm,\r\na liver-fluke, or a _Sacculina_, cannot possibly depend upon pure\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, chance does play a part in adaptations and\r\nspecies-transformations, and that not only in relation to the\r\nfundamental processes within the germ-plasm, but also in connexion\r\nwith the higher stages of the processes of selection, as I have\r\nalready briefly indicated. After the publication of my hypothesis of\r\ngerminal selection it was triumphantly pointed out that I had at last\r\nbeen obliged to admit a phyletic evolutionary force, the 'definitely\r\ndirected' variation of Nägeli and Askenazy. This reproach--if to\r\nallow oneself to be convinced be a reproach--is based upon a serious\r\nmisunderstanding. My 'variation in a definite direction' does not refer\r\nto the evolution of the organic world as a whole. I do not suppose,\r\nas Nägeli did, that this would have turned out essentially as it has\r\nactually done, even although the conditions of life or their succession\r\nupon the earth had been totally different; I believe that the organic\r\nworld, its classes and orders, its families and species, would have\r\ndiffered from those that have actually existed, both in succession and\r\nappearance, in proportion as the conditions of life were different.\r\nMy 'variation in a definite direction' is not predetermined from the\r\nbeginning, is not, so to speak, exclusive, but is many-sided; each\r\ndeterminant of a germ-plasm may vary in a plus or minus direction, and\r\nmay continue under certain circumstances in the direction once begun,\r\nbut its components, the different biophors, may do the same, and so\r\nlikewise may the groups, larger and smaller, of biophors which form\r\nthe primordia (_Anlagen_) of the organs within the germ-plasm. Thus\r\nan enormously large number of variational tendencies is available for\r\nevery part of the complete organism, and as soon as a variation would\r\nbe of advantage it arises--given that it is within the possibilities\r\nof the physical constitution of the species. It occurs because its\r\npotentialities are already present, but it persists and follows a\r\ndefinite course because this is the one that is favoured. In other\r\nwords, it is primarily fixed by germinal selection alone, but is then\r\npreferred by personal selection above the variants running parallel\r\nwith it. In my opinion the definite direction of the chance germinal\r\nvariations is determined only by the advantage which it affords to\r\nthe species with regard to its capacity for existence. But according\r\nto Nägeli the direction of a variation is quite independent of its\r\nutility, which may or may not exist. From Nägeli's point of view we\r\ncould never understand the all-prevailing adaptation, but if the\r\nutility of a variant is itself sufficient to raise it to the level of a\r\npersistent variational tendency, then we understand it.\r\n\r\nYears ago (1883) I compared the species to a wanderer who has before\r\nhim a vast immeasurable land, through which he is at liberty to choose\r\nwhatever path he prefers, and in which he may sojourn wherever and\r\nfor as long as he pleases. But although he may go or stay entirely\r\nof his own free will, yet at all times his going or staying will be\r\ndetermined--it must be so and cannot be otherwise--by two factors:\r\nfirst, by the paths available at each place--the variations which crop\r\nup--and secondly, by the prospects each of these available paths open\r\nup to him. He is striving after a restful place of abode which shall\r\nafford him comfortable subsistence, his former home having been spoilt\r\nfor him by increasing expensiveness or too great competition. Even the\r\ndirection of his first journey will not depend upon chance, since of\r\nthe many paths available he will, and must, choose that which leads to\r\na habitable and not too crowded spot. If this has been reached--that is\r\nto say, if the species has adapted itself to the new conditions--the\r\ncolonist sets up his abode there, and remains as long as a comfortable\r\nexistence and a competence are secure; but if these fail him, if grain\r\nbecomes scarce, or if prices rise, or if a dangerous epidemic breaks\r\nout, then he makes up his mind to wander anew, and once more he will\r\nchoose, among the many available paths, that which offers him the\r\nprospect of the speediest and most certain exit from the threatened\r\nregion, and leads him to another where he may live without risk. There,\r\ntoo, he will remain as long as he is comfortable and not exposed to\r\nwant or danger, for the species as a whole only becomes transformed\r\nwhen it must. And so it will go on _ad infinitum_; the traveller will,\r\nwhen he is scared away from one dwelling-place, be able to continue his\r\njourney in many directions, but he will always select the one path\r\nwhich offers him the best prospects of a comfortable settlement, and\r\nwill follow it only to the nearest suitable place of abode, and never\r\nfurther. The transformation of a species only goes on until it has\r\nagain completely adapted itself. In this way he will in the course of\r\nyears have traversed a large number of different places which, taken\r\ntogether, may lie in a strange and unintelligible course, but this\r\ncourse has nevertheless not arisen through a mere whim, but through\r\nthe twofold necessity of starting from a given spot--that in which he\r\nhad previously lived--the constitution of the species, and secondly of\r\nchoosing the most promising among the many available paths.\r\n\r\nBut chance does play a part in determining the route of the traveller,\r\nfor on it depends the nature of the conditions in the surroundings of\r\nhis previous dwelling-place, when he is forced to make another move;\r\nfor these conditions change, colonies are extended or depopulated,\r\na town previously cheap becomes dear, competition increases or\r\ndecreases, disease breaks out or disappears; in short, the chances of a\r\npleasureable sojourn in a particular place may alter and determine the\r\nwanderer who is on the point of leaving his place of abode to take a\r\ndifferent direction from that which he would probably have chosen, say,\r\nten years earlier.\r\n\r\nThe analogy might be carried further, as, for instance, to illustrate\r\nthe possibility of a splitting up of the species; we may suppose that\r\ninstead of one wanderer there is a pair, who found a family at their\r\nfirst halting-place. Children and grandchildren grow up in numbers and\r\nfood becomes scarce. One part of the descendants still finds enough\r\nto live upon, but the rest set out to look for a new habitation. In\r\nthis case, too, many paths, sidewards or backwards, stand open to the\r\nwanderers, but only those paths will be actually and successfully\r\nfollowed by any company of them which will lead to a habitable place\r\nwhere settlement is possible. If some of the descendants follow paths\r\nwith no such prospect they will soon turn back or will succumb to the\r\nperils of the journey.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the contrast between this and Nägeli's view of\r\nthe transmutation of species is obvious enough. According to him the\r\nwanderer is not free to choose his path, but goes on and on along a\r\ndefinite railway-line that only diverges here and there, and it cannot\r\nbe foreseen whether the track leads to paradisaic dwellings or to\r\nbarren wastes--the travellers must just make the best of what they\r\nfind. They carry a marvellous travelling outfit with them--a sort of\r\n_Tischlein, deck' dich_--the Lamarckian principle, but the magic power\r\nof this is very doubtful, and it will hardly suffice to guard them\r\nagainst the heat of the deserts, the frost of the Arctic regions, or\r\nthe malaria of the marshes into which their locomotive blindly carries\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAccording to my view, the traveler--that is, the species--has always\r\na large choice of paths, and is able, even while he is on the way,\r\nto discern whether he has chosen a right or a wrong one; moreover,\r\nin most cases, one or, it may be, a number of the paths lead to the\r\ndesired dwelling-place. But it also undoubtedly happens that, after\r\nlong wandering and when many regions have been traversed, a company\r\nmay finally arrive at a place which is quite habitable and inviting at\r\nfirst sight, but which is surrounded on several sides by the sea or by\r\na rushing stream. As long as the soil remains fertile and the climate\r\nhealthy all goes well, but when matters change in this respect, and\r\nperhaps the only way back lies through marshes and desert land and is\r\ntherefore impassable, then the colony will gradually die out--that is\r\nthe death of the species.\r\n\r\nBut let us now leave our parable and inquire what paths the organic\r\nworld has actually taken in its transformations, in what succession\r\nthe individual forms of life have evolved from one another; in short,\r\nhow the actual genealogical tree of this earth's animate population is\r\nreally constructed in detail. To this I can only reply that we have\r\nmany well-grounded suppositions, but only real certainty in regard\r\nto isolated cases. Thus the genealogical tree of the horse has been\r\ntraced far back, and a great deal is known of the phylogeny of several\r\nGastropods and Cephalopods, but in regard to the genealogical tree\r\nof organisms as a whole we can only make guesses, many of which are\r\nprobable, but are never quite certain. The palæontological records\r\nwhich the earth's crust has preserved for us for all the ages are much\r\ntoo incomplete to admit of any certainty. Many naturalists, notably\r\nErnst Haeckel, have done good service in this direction, for from\r\nwhat we know of palæontology, embryology, and morphology, they have\r\nconstructed genealogical trees of the different groups of organisms,\r\nwhich are intended to show us the actual succession of animal and plant\r\nforms. But, interesting as these attempts are, they cannot for the\r\nmost part be anything more than guesswork, and I need not, therefore,\r\nstate or discuss them here in any detail, since they can afford us no\r\naid in regard to the problem of the origin of species with which these\r\nlectures are concerned. In regard to the animal world at least--and the\r\ncase of plants is probably very similar--the record of fossil forms\r\nfails us at an early stage. Thus the oldest and deepest strata in which\r\nfossils can be demonstrated, the Cambrian formation, already contains\r\nCrustaceans, animals at a relatively high stage of organization, which\r\nmust have been preceded by a very long series of ancestors of which\r\nno trace has been preserved. The whole basal portion of the animal\r\ngenealogical tree, from the lowest forms of life at least up to these\r\nprimitive Crustaceans, the Trilobites, lies buried in the deepest\r\nsedimentary rocks raised from the sea-floor, the crystalline schists,\r\nin which it is unrecognizable. Enormous pressure and, probably also,\r\nhigh temperature have destroyed the solid parts as far as there were\r\nany, and the soft parts have only left an occasional impression even in\r\nthe higher strata.\r\n\r\nThus enormous periods of time must have elapsed from the beginning\r\nof life to the laying down of that deepest 'Palæozoic' formation,\r\nthe Cambrian, for not only does the whole chain which leads from the\r\nBiophoridæ to the origin of the first unicellulars fall within this\r\nperiod, as well as the evolution of these unicellulars themselves\r\ninto their different classes, and their integration into the first\r\nmulticellulars, but also the evolution of these last into all the main\r\nbranches of the animal kingdom as it is now, into Sponges, Starfishes,\r\nand their allies, Molluscs, Brachiopods, and Crustaceans, for all these\r\nbranches appear even in the Cambrian formation, and we may conclude\r\nthat the worms also, most of which are soft and not likely to be\r\npreserved, were abundantly present at that time, since jointed animals\r\nlike the Crustaceans can only have arisen from worms. Moreover, we have\r\nevery reason for the assumption that Cœlenterates also, that is to say\r\npolyps and medusoids, lived in the Cambrian seas, because their near\r\nrelatives with a solid skeleton, the corals, are represented in the\r\nformation next above, the Silurian. The same is true of the fishes,\r\nof which the first undoubtedly recognizable remains, the spines of\r\nsharks, have been found in the Silurian. These two presuppose a long\r\npreparatory history, and thus we come to the conclusion already stated,\r\nthat all the branches of the animal kingdom were already in existence\r\nwhen the earth's crust shut up within itself the first records\r\navailable for us of the ancestors of our modern world of organisms.\r\n\r\nOf course at that time the higher branches had only been represented\r\nby their lower classes, and this is true especially of vertebrates,\r\nso that, from the laying down of the Cambrian strata to the modern\r\nworld of organisms, a very considerable increase of complexity in\r\nstructure and an infinite diversifying of new groups must have taken\r\nplace. Amphibians do not appear to have been present in Cambrian times;\r\nreptiles are represented in the Carboniferous strata, but only appear\r\nin abundance in Secondary times; birds appear first in the Jurassic,\r\nbut in a very different guise (_Archæopteryx_) from the modern forms,\r\ncovered indeed with feathers, but still possessing a reptilian tail;\r\nlater they occur as toothed birds in the Cretaceous, and in Tertiary\r\ntimes they have their present form. The development of mammals must\r\nhave run almost parallel with that of birds, that is, from the\r\nbeginning of Secondary times onwards, and their highest and last member\r\nappears, as far as is known to research, only in post-Glacial times, in\r\nthe Diluvial deposits.\r\n\r\nTo the types which have arisen since the Cambrian period belongs the\r\nclass of Insects with its twelve orders and its enormous wealth of\r\nknown species, now reckoned at 200,000. They are demonstrable first in\r\nthe Devonian, and then in the Carboniferous period, in forms, just as\r\nour theory requires, with _biting_ mouth-organs; it is not until the\r\nCretaceous strata that insects with purely suctorial mouth-organs--bees\r\nand butterflies--occur, as it was also at that time that the flowers,\r\nwhich have evolved in mutual adaptation with insects, first appeared.\r\n\r\nThe number of fossil species hitherto described is reckoned at about\r\n80,000--certainly only a mere fragment of the wealth of forms of\r\nlife which have arisen on our earth throughout this long period, and\r\nwhich must have passed away again; for very few _species_ outlive a\r\ngeological epoch, and even genera appear only for a longer or shorter\r\ntime, and then disappear for ever. But even of many of the older\r\nclasses, such, for instance, as the Cystoids among the Echinoderms of\r\nthe Silurian seas, no living representative remains; and in the same\r\nway, the Ichthyosaurs or fish-lizards of the Secondary times have\r\ncompletely disappeared from our modern fauna, and many other animal\r\ntypes, like the class of Brachiopods and the hard-scaled Ganoid fishes,\r\nhave almost died out and are represented only by a few species in\r\nspecially sheltered places, such as the great depths of the sea, or in\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nThus an incredible wealth of animal and plant species was potentially\r\ncontained in these simplest and lowest 'Biophorids' which lay far\r\nbelow the limits of microscopic visibility--an indefinitely greater\r\nwealth than has actually arisen, for that is only a small part of\r\nwhat was possible, and of what would have arisen had the changes of\r\nlife-conditions and life-possibilities followed a different course. The\r\ngreater the complexity of the structure of an organism is, the more\r\nnumerous are the parts of it which are capable of variation, and the\r\ndifferent directions in which it can adapt itself to new conditions;\r\nand it will hardly be disputed that _potentially_ the first Biophorids\r\ncontained an absolutely inexhaustible wealth of forms of life, and\r\nnot merely those which have actually been evolved. If this were not\r\nso, Man could not still call forth new animal and plant forms, as he\r\nis continually doing among our domesticated animals and cultivated\r\nplants, just as the chemist is continually 'creating' new combinations\r\nin the laboratory which have probably never yet occurred or been\r\nformed on the earth. But just as the chemist does not really 'create'\r\nthese combinations, but only brings the necessary elements and their\r\nforces together in such a combination that they must unite to form the\r\ndesired new body, so the breeder only guides the variational tendencies\r\ncontained in the germ-plasm, and consciously combines them to procure a\r\nnew race. And what the breeder does within the narrow limits of human\r\npower is being accomplished in free nature, through the conditions\r\nwhich allow only what is fit to survive and reproduce, and thus bring\r\nabout the wonderful result--as though it were guided by a superior\r\nintelligence--the adaptation of species to their environment.\r\n\r\nThus in our time the great riddle has been solved--the riddle of the\r\norigin of what is suited to its purpose, without the co-operation of\r\npurposive forces. Although we cannot demonstrate and follow out the\r\nparticular processes of transformation and adaptation in all their\r\nphases with mathematical certainty, we can understand the principle,\r\nand we see the factors through the co-operation of which the result\r\nmust be brought about. It has lately become the fashion, at least among\r\nthe younger school of biologists, to attach small value to natural\r\nselection, if not, indeed, to regard it as a superseded formula;\r\nmathematical proofs are demanded or, at any rate, desired. I do not\r\nbelieve that we shall ever arrive at giving such proofs, but we shall\r\nundoubtedly succeed in clearing up much that now remains obscure, and\r\nin essentially modifying and correcting many of the theories we have\r\nformed in regard to this question. But what has been already gained\r\nmust certainly be regarded as an enormous advance on the knowledge of\r\nfifty years ago. We now _know_ that the modern world of organisms has\r\nbeen evolved, and we can form an idea, though still only an imperfect\r\none, how and through the co-operation of what factors it could and must\r\nhave evolved.\r\n\r\nWhen I say _must_, this refers only to the course of evolution from\r\na given beginning; but as to this beginning itself, the spontaneous\r\ngeneration of the lowest Biophorids from inorganic material, we are far\r\nfrom having understood it as a necessary outcome of its causes. And if\r\nwe have assumed it as a reasonable postulate, we by no means seek to\r\nconceal that this assumption is far from implying an understanding of\r\nwhat the process of biogenesis was. I do not merely mean that we do\r\nnot know under what external conditions the origin of living matter,\r\neven in the smallest quantity, can take place; I mean, especially,\r\nthat we do not understand how this one substance should suddenly\r\nreveal qualities which have never been detected in any other chemical\r\ncombination whatever--the circulation of matter, metabolism, growth,\r\nsensation, will, and movement. But we may confidently say that we shall\r\nnever be able fully to understand these specific phenomena of life, as\r\nindeed how should we, since nothing analogous to them is known to us,\r\nand since understanding always presupposes a comparison with something\r\nknown. Even although we assume that we might succeed in understanding\r\nthe mere chemistry of life, as is not inconceivable, I mean the\r\n_perpetuum mobile_ of dissimilation and assimilation, the so-called\r\n'animal' functions of the living substance would remain uncomprehended:\r\nSensation, Will, Thought. We understand in some measure how the kidneys\r\nsecrete urine, or the liver bile; we can also--given the sensitiveness\r\nto stimulus of the living substance--understand how a sense-impression\r\nmay be conveyed by the nerves to the brain, carried along certain\r\nreflex paths to motor nerves and give rise to movement of the muscles,\r\nbut how the activity of certain brain-elements can give rise to a\r\nthought _which cannot be compared with anything material_, which is\r\nnevertheless able to react upon the material parts of our body, and, as\r\nWill, to give rise to movement--that we attempt in vain to understand.\r\nOf course the dependence of thinking and willing upon a material\r\nsubstratum is clear enough, and it can be demonstrated with certainty\r\nin many directions, and thus materialism is so far justified in drawing\r\nparallels between the brain and thought on the one hand, and the\r\nkidneys and urine on the other, but this is by no means to say that we\r\nhave understood how Thought and Will have come to be. In recent times\r\nit has often been pointed out that the physical functions of the body\r\nincrease very gradually with the successive stages of the organization,\r\nand from the lowest beginnings ascend slowly to the intelligence of\r\nMan, in exact correspondence with the height of organization that has\r\nbeen reached by the species; that they begin so imperceptibly among\r\nthe lower animal forms that we cannot tell exactly where the beginning\r\nis; and it has been rightly concluded from this that the elements of\r\nthe Psyche do not originate in the histological parts of the nervous\r\nsystem, but are peculiar to all living matter, and it has further been\r\ninferred that even inorganic material may contain them, although in an\r\nunrecognizable expression, and that their emergence in living matter\r\nis, so to speak, only a phenomenon of summation. If we are right in our\r\nassumption of a spontaneous generation it can hardly be otherwise, but\r\nsaying this does not mean that we have understood Spirit, but at most\r\nsecures us the advantage and the right of looking at this world, as far\r\nas we know it, as a unity. This is the standpoint of Monism.\r\n\r\nThe psychical phenomena, which we know from ourselves, and can assume\r\namong animals with greater certainty the nearer they stand to us,\r\noccupy a domain by themselves, and such a vast and complex one that\r\nthere can be no question of bringing it within the scope of our present\r\nstudies, and the same is true of the phyletic development of Man. But\r\nwe must at least take up a position in regard to these problems, and\r\nthere can be no question that Man has evolved from animal ancestors,\r\nwhose nearest relatives were the Anthropoid Apes. Not many years ago\r\nbony remains of a human skeleton, or at least of some form very near\r\nto modern Man, were found in the Diluvial deposits of Java, and this\r\nhas been designated _Pithecanthropus erectus_, and perhaps rightly\r\nregarded as a transition form between Apes and Man. It is possible that\r\nmore may yet be discovered; but even if that is not so, the conclusion\r\nthat Man had his origin from animal forefathers must be regarded as\r\ninevitable and fully established. We do not draw conclusions with our\r\neyes, but with our reasoning powers, and if the whole of the rest of\r\nliving nature proclaims with one accord from all sides the evolution\r\nof the world of organisms, we cannot assume that the process stopped\r\nshort of Man. But it follows also that the _factors_ which brought\r\nabout the development of Man from his Simian ancestry must be the same\r\nas those which have brought about the whole of evolution: change of\r\nexternal influences in its direct and indirect effects, and, besides\r\nthis, germinal variational tendencies and their selection. And in\r\nthis connexion I should like to draw attention to a point which has,\r\nperhaps, as yet received too little attention.\r\n\r\nSelection only gives rise to what is suited to its end; _beyond\r\nthat it can call forth nothing_, as we have already emphasized on\r\nseveral occasions. I need only recall the protective leaf-marking of\r\nbutterflies, which is never a botanically exact copy of a leaf, with\r\nall its lateral veins, but is comparable rather to an impressionist\r\npainting, in which it is not the reproduction of every detail that is\r\nof importance, but the total impression which it makes at a certain\r\ndistance. If we apply this to the organs and capacities of Man, we\r\nshall only expect to find these developed as far as their development\r\nis of value for the preservation of his existence and no further. But\r\nthis may perhaps seem a contradiction of what observation teaches us,\r\nthat, for instance, our eyes can see to the infinite distance of the\r\nfixed stars, although this can be of no importance in relation to\r\nthe struggle for existence. But this intensity of the power of vision\r\nhas obviously not been acquired for the investigation of the starry\r\nheavens, but was of the greatest value in securing the existence of\r\nmany of our animal ancestors, and was not less important for our own.\r\nIn the same way our finely evolved musical ear might be regarded as a\r\nperfecting of the hearing apparatus far beyond the degree necessary to\r\nexistence, but this is not really the case: our musical ear, too, has\r\nbeen inherited from our animal ancestors, and to them, as to primitive\r\nMan, it was a necessity of existence. It was quite necessary for the\r\nanimals to distinguish the higher and lower notes of a long scale,\r\nsharply and certainly, in order to be able to evade an approaching\r\nenemy, or to recognize prey from afar. That we are able to make music\r\nis, so to speak, only an unintentional accessory power of the hearing\r\norgans, which were originally developed only for the preservation of\r\nexistence, just as the human hand did not become what it is _in order\r\nto play the piano_, but to touch and seize, to make tools, and so on.\r\n\r\n_Must this, then, be true also of the human mind?_ Can it, too, only\r\nbe developed as far as its development is of advantage to Man's\r\npower of survival? I believe that this is certainly the case in a\r\ngeneral way; the intellectual powers which are the common property\r\nof the human race will never rise beyond these limits, but this is\r\nnot to say that certain individuals may not be more highly endowed.\r\nThe possibility of a higher development of certain mental powers or\r\nof their combinations--whether it be intelligence, will, feeling,\r\ninventive power, or a talent for mathematics, music or painting--may\r\nbe inferred with certainty from our own principles; for not only may\r\nthe variational tendencies of individual groups of determinants in the\r\ngerm-plasm be continued for a series of generations without becoming\r\ninjurious, that is to say, without being put a stop to by personal\r\nselection, but sexual intermingling always opens up the possibility\r\nthat some predominantly developed intellectual tendencies (_Anlagen_)\r\nmay combine in one way or another, and so give rise to individuals of\r\ngreat mental superiority, in whatever direction. In this way, it seems\r\nto me, the geniuses of humanity have arisen--a Plato, a Shakespeare, a\r\nGoethe, a Beethoven. But they do not last; they do not transmit their\r\ngreatness; if they leave descendants at all, these never inherit the\r\n_whole_ greatness of their father, and we can easily understand this,\r\nsince the greatness does not depend upon a single character, but upon\r\na particular combination of many high mental qualities (_Anlagen_).\r\nGeniuses, therefore, probably never raise the average of the race\r\nthrough their descendants; they raise the intellectual average only\r\nthrough their own performances, by increasing the knowledge and power\r\nhanded on by tradition from generation to generation. But the raising\r\nof the average of mental capacity, which has undoubtedly taken place\r\nto a considerable degree from the Australasian aborigines to the\r\ncivilized peoples of antiquity and of our own day, can only depend on\r\nthe struggle for existence between individuals and races.\r\n\r\nBut if the human mind has been raised to its present level through\r\nthe same slow process of selection by means of which all evolution\r\nhas been directed and raised to the height necessary for the 'desired\r\nend,' we must see in this a definite indication that even the greatest\r\nmind among us can never see beyond the conditions which limit our\r\ncapacity for existence, and that now and for all time we cannot hope\r\nto understand what is supernatural. We can recognize the stars in the\r\nheavens, it is true, and after thousands of years of work we have\r\nsucceeded in determining their distance, their size, and gravity, as\r\nwell as their movements and the materials of which they are composed,\r\nbut we have been able to do all this with a thinking power created\r\nfor the conditions of human existence upon the earth, that is to say,\r\ndeveloped by them, just as we do not only grasp with our hands, but\r\nmay also play the piano with them. But all that involves a higher\r\nthinking power that would enable us to recognize the pseudo-ideas of\r\neverlastingness and infinity, the limits of causality, in short, all\r\nthat we do not know but regard as at best a riddle, will always remain\r\nsealed to us, because our intelligence did not, and does not, require\r\nthis power to maintain our capacity for existence.\r\n\r\nI say this in particular to those who imagine they have summed up the\r\nwhole situation when they admit that much is still lacking to complete\r\nknowledge, say, to a true understanding of the powers of Nature or\r\nof the Psyche, but who do not feel that in spite of all our very\r\nconsiderably increased knowledge we stand before the world as a whole\r\nas before a great riddle. But I say it also to those who fear that the\r\ndoctrine of evolution will be the overthrow of their faith. Let them\r\nnot forget that truth can only be harmful, and may even be destructive,\r\nwhen we have only half grasped it, or when we try to evade it. If\r\nwe follow it unafraid, we shall come now and in the future to the\r\nconclusion that a limit is set to our knowledge by our own minds, and\r\nthat beyond this limit begins the region of faith, and this each must\r\nfashion for himself as suits his nature. In regard to ultimate things\r\nGoethe has given us the true formula, when the 'Nature-spirit' calls\r\nto Faust, 'Du gleichst dem Geist, den Du begreifst, nicht mir!' For all\r\ntime Man must repeat this to himself, but the need for an ethical view\r\nof the world, a religion, will remain, though even this must change in\r\nits expression according to the advance of our knowledge of the world.\r\n\r\nBut we must not conclude these lectures in a spirit of mere\r\nresignation. Although we must content ourselves without being able to\r\npenetrate the arcana of this wonderful world, we must remain conscious,\r\nat the same time, that these unfathomable depths exist, and that we\r\nmay 'still verehren was unerforschlich ist' (Goethe). But the other\r\nhalf of the world, I mean the part which is accessible to us, discloses\r\nto us such an inexhaustible wealth of phenomena, and such a deep and\r\nunfailing enjoyment in its beauty and the harmonious interaction of the\r\ninnumerable wheels of its marvellous mechanism, that the investigation\r\nof it is quite worthy to fill our lives. And we need have no fear\r\nthat there will ever be any lack of new questions and new problems to\r\nsolve. Even if Mankind could continue for centuries quietly working\r\non in the manifold and restless manner that has, for the first time\r\nin the history of human thought, characterized the century just gone,\r\neach new solution would raise new questions above and below, in the\r\nimmeasurable space of the firmament, as in the world of microscopical\r\nor ultramicroscopical minuteness, new insight would be gained,\r\nnew satisfaction won, and our enthusiasm over the marvel of this\r\nworld-mechanism, so extraordinarily complex yet so beautifully simple\r\nin its operation, will never be extinguished, but will always flame up\r\nanew to warm and illumine our lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n[References to vol. ii have the volume prefixed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Accessory idioplasm, 383.\r\n\r\n  Acræides, immunity of, 100.\r\n\r\n  Adaptation, in leaf butterflies, ii. 346;\r\n    of the sperm-cells to fertilization, 278, 279;\r\n    facultative, ii. 278;\r\n    functional, 244;\r\n    harmonious, ii. 80, 197;\r\n    not chance but necessity, ii. 346;\r\n    all evolution depends upon, ii. 347.\r\n\r\n  Affinities, vital, within the 'person,' ii. 36;\r\n    within the id, 374.\r\n\r\n  Agassiz, L., immutability of the species, 16.\r\n\r\n  Alcoholism, ii. 68.\r\n\r\n  Aldrovandi, 13.\r\n\r\n  Amixia, ii. 285, 286.\r\n\r\n  Ammon, O., the variation-playground, ii. 199, 202.\r\n\r\n  Amœba 'nests,' ii. 219.\r\n\r\n  Amphigony, 267;\r\n    as a factor in maintaining species, ii. 204.\r\n\r\n  Amphimixis, general significance of, ii. 192;\r\n    antiquity of, ii. 202;\r\n    Ammon's playground of variations, ii. 206;\r\n    Amœba 'nests' as a preliminary stage, ii. 219;\r\n    beginnings of, ii. 213;\r\n    parthenogenesis as self-fertilization, ii. 233;\r\n    in Coccidium, ii. 214, 216;\r\n    chromosomes in Protozoa, ii. 216;\r\n    the 'cycle' idea, 326;\r\n    increased stability due to, ii. 200;\r\n    continued inbreeding, ii. 231;\r\n    'formative' stimulus, ii. 229;\r\n    Galton's curves of frequency, ii. 206;\r\n    in relation to rudimentary organs, ii. 226;\r\n    immediate consequences of, ii. 224;\r\n    plastogamy as a preliminary stage of, ii. 222;\r\n    alters individuality, ii. 192;\r\n    and natural death, 335;\r\n    direct advantages of, ii. 198;\r\n    origin of, ii. 211;\r\n    association of, with reproduction, ii. 210;\r\n    increases power of adaptation, ii. 223;\r\n    preliminary stages of, ii. 213;\r\n    not a rejuvenescence in the sense of preserving life, ii. 221.\r\n\r\n  Ancestral plasm, ids of, ii. 38.\r\n\r\n  Ants, several kinds of ids in the germ-plasm of, 390;\r\n    harmonious adaptation of sterile forms, ii. 89;\r\n    degeneration of wings and ovaries in the workers, ii. 90;\r\n    transition forms between females and workers, ii. 92;\r\n    Wasmann's explanation of these, ii. 93;\r\n    _Polyergus rufescens_, ii. 95;\r\n    dimorphism of workers, ii. 96;\r\n    number of queens, ii. 98.\r\n\r\n  Apes, furred, in Tibet, ii. 269.\r\n\r\n  Arctic animals, sympathetic colouring in, 62.\r\n\r\n  Aristotle, 10.\r\n\r\n  Assimilation, ii. 371.\r\n\r\n  Auerbach, spindle-figure of the dividing cell-nucleus, 289.\r\n\r\n  Autotomy, self-amputation, ii. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Baer, K.
