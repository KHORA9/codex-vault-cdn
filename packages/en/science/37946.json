B. LIPPINCOTT\r\n& Co., in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MONTH IN SICILY.\r\n\r\nFIRST PAPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA FAVORITA.]\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the first of February we stood on the deck of the\r\nsteamer for Palermo, watching the sun rise over the water. Far away in the\r\nsouth the blue edge of the sea began to grow bluer with the rising of the\r\ndistant land. A fresh breeze blew from the shore--not a pleasant feature in\r\nFebruary weather at home, but suggesting comparisons with the warmest\r\nmorning of a New England May. With the swift advance of the steamer the\r\nblue line in the south rapidly rose above the level of the sea into the\r\ndefinite shape of a rugged mountain-range: gradually the blueness of\r\ndistance changed to rich shades of brown and red on the jagged, treeless\r\nsummits, and to deepest green where long orange-farms border the bases of\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\nWho has not longed to see Sicily? Every one who loves poetry, romance or\r\nthe history of ancient civilization must often turn in thought to this\r\nbeautiful and famous Mediterranean island. To the most ancient poets it was\r\na mysterious land, where dwelt the monster Charybdis and the bloody\r\nLaestrigones; where Ulysses met the Cyclops; where the immortal gods waged\r\nbattles with the giant sons of Earth, and bound Enceladus in his eternal\r\nprison. No doubt it was the terrific natural phenomena of Sicily--the\r\nearthquakes and the outbursts of Etna--which rendered it so much a land of\r\nhorrors to the early Greek imagination. But in that far-distant age it was\r\nnot only the terrors of the place that had worked upon the imaginative\r\nGreeks: the almost tropical luxuriance of the country, the unrivalled\r\nscenery, the brilliancy of the sky, made it a fitting ground for the\r\nadventures of nymphs, heroes and gods. In the fountain of Sicilian Ortygia\r\ndwelt Arethusa, the nymph dear to the poets; beside the Lake of Enna, where\r\nrich vegetation overran the lips of the extinct volcano, was the spot\r\ncalled in mythology the meeting-place of Pluto and Proserpine--the power of\r\ndarkness and the springing plant personified; and so through all the\r\ncountry places were found made sacred by the presence of the great\r\ndivinities, and temples were erected in their honor.\r\n\r\nWhen the age of fable had passed away, far back in the early dawn of\r\nEuropean history begins authentic knowledge about Sicily. While wicked Ahaz\r\nreigned in the kingdom of Judah, and Isaiah had not ceased to utter his\r\nprophecies, the Greek colonization of Sicily began. Seven hundred and\r\nthirty-five years before Christ, Theocles with his band of Greeks from\r\nEuboea founded Naxos on the coast, hard by the fertile slopes of Etna.\r\nWithin three centuries from that time the whole Sicilian coast had been\r\nstudded with Greek cities, and to such wealth, power and splendor of art\r\nhad they attained that all succeeding epochs of the island's history seem\r\ndegenerate times when compared with that early golden age.\r\n\r\nIt has been truly said that \"there is not a nation which has materially\r\ninfluenced the destinies of European civilization that has not left\r\ndistinct traces of its activity in this island.\" Phoenicians, Greeks,\r\nRomans, Saracens, Normans, Spaniards, French and English have successively\r\noccupied the island, and noble monuments of the varied civilizations are\r\nstanding to this day. Scattered through the island, their architectural\r\nremains crown the mountain-tops or lie in confusion along the Mediterranean\r\nshore, a series of ruins extending through twenty-five centuries, unmatched\r\nin any other country for variety of age and style.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock our steamer entered the Gulf of Palermo, passing near the\r\nbase of Monte Pellegrino, a wild promontory which towers up two thousand\r\nfeet from the sea. On the day before I had entered for the first time the\r\nfamous Bay of Naples, but with less delight than I now looked upon the\r\nbeauties of this Sicilian gulf. Flanked with lofty mountains, colored with\r\nthe matchless blue of the Mediterranean, studded with picturesque lateen\r\nsails, the bay is a fitting entrance to this fair historic island: a more\r\nbeautiful approach could hardly be imagined even to the Islands of the\r\nBlessed.\r\n\r\nThe Italians call Palermo _la felice_ (\"the happy\"). It is most happy in\r\nits climate, its situation and its noble streets and gardens. Below the\r\ncity lies the lovely bay: behind it stretches back for miles, between\r\nconverging mountain-chains, the fruit-producing level of the Golden Shell\r\n(_La Conca d'Oro_). The plain is one vast orchard of oranges and lemons\r\nwhich every year distributes its huge crop over half the habitable globe.\r\nThe city is worthy of its position. The chief streets are broad, clean and\r\nhandsomely built--a contrast to the universal shabbiness and squalor we had\r\nfound in Naples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATHEDRAL OF PALERMO.]\r\n\r\nA traveller is sure to be put in a good humor with the place by the many\r\nand unusual comforts which he meets in the great sea-fronting hotel; and\r\nthe first look from the windows of his apartment confirms the opinion that\r\nPalermo is the fairest of Southern cities. The outlook is upon the grand\r\nseashore drive, the Marina, as gay and pretty a sight as can be found in\r\nany European capital. The broad, tree-shaded avenue, bordered on one side\r\nby hotels and palaces, on the other by the waters of the bay, is thronged\r\nwith private carriages. Beginning at the sea-facing gate of the city, the\r\nroad commands through all its length a view of the mountains, the bay and\r\nthe open sea: at its terminus lie the public flower-gardens--acres of our\r\nchoicest hothouse plants growing in tropical profusion.\r\n\r\nIn Palermo, as in so many European towns, the cathedral is the chief\r\narchitectural attraction. To approach it from the bay the whole length of\r\nthe city must be traversed on the Corso Vittorio Emmanuele, the chief\r\nbusiness street. This corso is crossed at the centre of the town by another\r\nof equal width, which also commemorates by its name Italian unity--the\r\nCorso Garibaldi. There is one other broad and important street which no\r\nAmerican can enter without remembering that even in this distant land the\r\ninterest and sympathy of the people have been with our country in its\r\nstruggles and successes: it is the Via Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe drive up the Corso gives an opportunity for seeing a remarkably\r\nhandsome street lined with gay shops, and for studying the peculiar and\r\noften fine faces of the Sicilian people; but nothing of striking interest\r\nappears until, near the centre of the town, a street opening on the left\r\ndiscloses a vista ending in a small forest of white marble statues. On a\r\nnearer view it is found that the statues belong to the immense fountain of\r\nthe Piazza Pretoria, a work erected about A. D. 1550 by command of the\r\nsenate of Palermo. It is perhaps the largest and most elaborate fountain in\r\nEurope, and, though it is easy to criticise the countless sculptures that\r\nadorn it, the whole effect of their combination into an architectural unit\r\nis most imposing.\r\n\r\nContinuing the drive up the Corso, a broad piazza suddenly opens on the\r\nright, flanked by the cathedral. The abruptness of the transition from\r\nbetween the dark lines of buildings into the sunlight of the square adds to\r\nthe first strong impression produced by the beauty of the vast duomo. In\r\nits external architecture the church is unique: the charm of it to one who\r\nhas been travelling through Italy is its utter dissimilarity to all the\r\nItalian churches. Architectural writers call it a building of the \"Sicilian\r\nGothic style;\" and, though the expression does not convey a vivid image\r\nexcept to the student of art, any one can see its essential difference from\r\nthe style of the North, and can recognize the rare grandeur and beauty of\r\nthe church. The form is simple, but the dimensions are grand. Without the\r\nboldness of outline of true Gothic churches, the walls are so covered with\r\nornaments of interlacing arches, cornices and arabesque slightly raised on\r\nthe masonry as to produce an effect of wonderful richness. The style is\r\npeculiarly Sicilian, yet every observer of mediaeval churches will at once\r\ndetect the Norman, Italian and Saracenic influences blended in an exquisite\r\nharmony. Connected with the church by light arches, but separated from it\r\nby a street, stands the campanile, a mass of enormous solidity, terminating\r\nin many pinnacles and one slender and graceful tower rising above them all.\r\nFour other lofty towers, springing from the corners of the church, give\r\nadditional lightness to its elegant design: they were added to the building\r\nnearly three centuries after the Norman conquest of Sicily, and yet their\r\nminaret-like form and pointed panel ornaments show how strong and lasting\r\nhad been the influence of Arabian art upon the mediaeval architects of\r\nSicily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROTTO OF SANTA ROSALIA.]\r\n\r\nIt is seven hundred years since the foundations of the duomo were laid. In\r\nthat distant age, and in a land so remote, it is a curious circumstance\r\nthat its founder was an Englishman: _Gualterio Offamilio_ is the amusing\r\nItalian corruption by which the name of Walter of the Mill was suited to\r\nthe Southern tongue. After Roger and his Normans had driven from Sicily the\r\nArab power which had held the land for more than two centuries, and when\r\nChristianity had succeeded the Mohammedan religion throughout the island,\r\nArchbishop Walter assumed spiritual sovereignty in Palermo, and founded\r\nthis cathedral on the site of an ancient mosque. Only a part of the\r\noriginal building remains in the crypt and two walls of the present church.\r\nAll subsequent ages have changed and added to its original simple form, but\r\noften have taken from its beauty. Within the church only a part of the\r\nsouth aisle commands close attention: there in canopied sarcophagi of\r\nporphyry reposes the dust of Roger, king of Sicily (1154), of Henry VI.,\r\nemperor of Germany, and of Frederick II., Roger's most illustrious\r\ngrandson, king of Sicily, king of Jerusalem and emperor of Germany. In a\r\nchapel at the right of the high altar, sacred to Santa Rosalia, rest the\r\nbones of the saint enshrined in a sarcophagus of silver. Thirteen hundred\r\npounds of the precious metal are wrought into the shrine, and the whole\r\nchapel is sumptuous with marble frescoes and gilding, for to the pious\r\nsouls of Palermo this is the very holy of holies. The cathedral is\r\ndedicated to Rosalia, and almost divine honors are paid to her by the city\r\nfrom which she fled in horror at its wickedness.\r\n\r\nEvery summer a festival of three days is held in honor of this favorite\r\nsaint; and again in September a day is kept to commemorate her death, when\r\na vast concourse of people from Palermo climb the side of the neighboring\r\nMonte Pellegrino to worship at the grotto of St. Rosalia, a natural cavern\r\nsituated under an overhanging crag of the summit. Here the faithful\r\nSicilians believe that the holy maiden dwelt in solitude for many years;\r\nand here were found in 1624 the bones of the saint, which put a stop to the\r\nplague then raging in Palermo. The cave has been made a church by building\r\na porch at the entrance. Twisted columns of alabaster support the roof of\r\nthe vestibule, but within the cavern the walls are of the natural rock,\r\ncontrasting strangely with the magnificent workmanship of the high altar,\r\nbeneath which lies the marble statue of the saint overlaid with a robe of\r\ngold, while about the recumbent figure are placed a book and skull and\r\nother objects of pure gold. It is a figure of a fair young girl,\r\nrepresented by the artist as dying, with her head at rest upon one hand.\r\nThough the statue is the work of no very famous artist, Goethe in the\r\nnarrative of his Sicilian travel has truly said of it, \"The head and hands\r\nof white marble are, if not faultless in style, at least so pleasing and\r\nnatural that one cannot help expecting to see them move.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the southern precipices of this Mountain of the Pilgrim lies a royal\r\npark, and in the midst of it stands a gaudy and fantastic villa called La\r\nFavorita. The house is worth a visit for the sake of seeing what a\r\nhalf-crazy fancy will produce when united with royal wealth. King Ferdinand\r\nI., during his stay in Sicily early in this century, amused himself by\r\nbuilding this country palace in the style of a Chinese villa, and adorned\r\nit with innumerable little bells, to be rung by every movement of the wind.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Favorita that the old king found himself cornered by Lord\r\nWilliam Bentinck and his army during the British occupation of the island\r\nin 1812. It is said that his faithful subjects from Palermo encamped by\r\nthousands in the neighborhood--not, however, for the sake of defending\r\ntheir aged monarch, but to enjoy the fun of witnessing a fight in which\r\nboth sides were hated by them with equal cordiality.\r\n\r\nTo an enterprising traveller some of the pleasantest hours of a long tour\r\nare those when, cutting loose from all guides and books, he wanders alone\r\nthrough the streets of an old city, enjoying with a sense of discovery the\r\nscraps of antiquity not described in any book which he is sure to meet\r\nwith. Palermo and its neighborhood afford a most fertile field for such\r\nresearches. The Saracenic villas of the suburbs and the early Norman\r\nbuildings of the town will repay considerable patience spent in looking up\r\nthe beauties to be found in the details of their construction. For\r\ninstance, in the plain old church of S. Agostino there is a doorway and\r\nwheel window one sight of which is an ample reward for much wandering and\r\nsearching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONREALE]\r\n\r\nOn a morning too fresh and beautiful for staying in the city we rendered a\r\nvivacious cabman ecstatically happy by an engagement to drive us to\r\nMonreale. A brisk drive past the royal palace, out of the southern gate and\r\nfive miles across the orange-covered plain brought us to the foot of an\r\nabrupt mountain. Not a half mile away, but far above, on the seemingly\r\nunapproachable heights, was perched the quaint village which was our\r\ndestination: its ancient towering buildings glittered white and hot in the\r\nFebruary sun under the canopy of cloudless blue. Ascending for half an hour\r\non the well-constructed zigzag road, we stopped at the gate in the\r\ntown-wall to buy the luscious-looking fruit of the cactus from a road-side\r\nvender, one of those ideal hags, apparently preserved by desiccation under\r\nthe torrid sun, whom only Italy can produce in perfection. Then onward and\r\nupward we pushed through the village street--a street characteristic of\r\nthese Southern walled villages, narrow, dark, festooned above with\r\ninterminable lines of drying macaroni, covered below with abundant filth,\r\nand bordered by house-walls of enormous thickness, built for resisting\r\nheat. At every house-door or on the pavement in front sits the man of the\r\nhouse plying his trade, that all the world may know whether his goods are\r\nwell made or ill. Up and down the street flow the lines of dark-eyed,\r\nswarthy people--women robed in rags, occasionally set off by a bit of\r\nstriking color; children who in their astonishment become rigid at the\r\nsight of a foreigner; here and there an officer of the Italian army\r\ncarefully picking his way through the mud; and everywhere produce-laden\r\nasses driven toward Palermo by the most picturesque of cut-throats, for\r\nwithout its ever-present force of soldiers Monreale would at once relapse\r\ninto a hotbed of brigandage, as its recent history shows.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the summit of the town, facing a broad, paved square, stands the\r\ncathedral and its adjacent Benedictine monastery, both built upon the brink\r\nof the precipitous mountain, and both in external appearance severely\r\nplain, almost to shabbiness.\r\n\r\nWilliam II., king of Sicily, called the Good, founded on this Royal Mount a\r\nmonastery for the Benedictine friars, and built it up with all the strength\r\nof a fortress and the magnificence of a palace. Little is left of that\r\noriginal building, which was finished in 1174, but in its few remains have\r\nfortunately been preserved the most splendid of cloisters. This scene of\r\ncenturies of Benedictine meditations is a large quadrangle surrounded by an\r\narcade of multitudinous small pointed arches resting upon pairs of slender\r\nwhite marble columns, like stalks of snow-white lilies in their grace and\r\nlightness. Some of the marble shafts are wrought with reliefs of flowers\r\nand trailing vines, while most of them were inlaid in bands or spirals of\r\nmosaic in gold and colors, now injured by age. The capitals which crown\r\nthese shafts are exquisitely carved, and all mythology, the legends of the\r\nChurch and the book of Nature have been ransacked to furnish subjects for\r\nthe designs; so that out of two hundred or more no two are similar. All the\r\ndecaying magnificence of the great building is pervaded by an oppressive\r\nsilence, for it is one of the innumerable religious houses suppressed by\r\nthe Italian government.\r\n\r\nFrom the monastery to the cathedral is a walk of but a few steps. All\r\ndisappointment at the external plainness is forgotten in approaching the\r\nchief entrance of the church. Michael Angelo said of Ghiberti's doors at\r\nFlorence that \"they were worthy to be the entrance to Paradise.\" They have\r\nrightly become famous through all the world, and yet these doors of\r\nMonreale leave on the mind of the beholder a strong impression of their\r\nbeauty not less lasting than the Baptistery gates at Florence. In the\r\nexecution of the biblical reliefs which completely encrust the massive\r\nleaves of bronze they must yield, of course, to the mature art of\r\nGhiberti's later age; but the stately height of the solid metal doors, the\r\nalternate bands of mosaic and wrought-stone arabesques which flank them and\r\nsurround over head the Arabian arch, and, above all, the sense that they\r\nconceal from view unparalleled splendors beyond, leave on the mind an\r\nimpression which cannot be effaced.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no other building deserves the epithet \"splendid\" so exactly as the\r\ncathedral of Monreale: the whole interior is radiant from the vast extent\r\nof its pictured walls. All the walls and vaulting of the nave and aisles,\r\ntransepts and tribune, are overspread with ancient mosaics on a golden\r\nground. It is natural to compare St. Mark's cathedral at Venice with this\r\nchurch, on account of its immense mosaic-covered surface: its sumptuous\r\ninterior delights every beholder with the satisfying completeness which\r\nbelongs to it; yet in all the Oriental splendor of the Venetian church\r\nnothing can equal in impressiveness a glance down the nave of Monreale.\r\nWherever the eye turns it rests upon the glowing colors of some sacred\r\npicture--scenes from the Old Testament history, bright-robed figures of\r\nflying angels, haloed saints in the quaint Byzantine style, apostles and\r\nmartyrs, patriarchs and prophets, and, high above them all, from a great\r\npicture in the vaulting of the apse, a startling face of Christ looking\r\nsolemnly down through the length of the cathedral. Half the stiffness which\r\ncharacterizes these early mosaics seems to have been cast aside in treating\r\nthis supreme subject. The colossal size of the figure, the hand raised in\r\nblessing the multitude, the sad but awful expression of the countenance,\r\nmake it an all-pervading presence in the church. Amid all the glittering\r\nsplendor of the building, while the gorgeous pomp of a holiday mass\r\nprogressed and rippling strains of organ-music ran echoing through the\r\narches, through all the bewildering brightness of the spectacle, the\r\nmajesty of that Presence could not for a moment be forgotten, nor could the\r\neyes avoid straying off from the glitter below to answer again and again to\r\nthat solemn gaze above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA ZIZA.]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, in any ordinary picture, to convey more than a very faint\r\nidea of this building, in which the peculiar beauties are dependent upon\r\ncolor, unlike the Gothic churches of the North: nothing but an oil painting\r\nof minute details could render the effects produced by the bars of sunshine\r\ndescending through the twilight of the church and striking on the glowing,\r\npictured walls. The extent of surface covered by the mosaics is said to be\r\nmore than sixty thousand square feet.\r\n\r\nBy the bounty of the same pious monarch who endowed the neighboring\r\nmonastery the cathedral was completed just seven hundred years ago. His\r\nbody lies entombed in the transept: his monument is the wonderful pile\r\nwhose construction has made his name to be remembered by succeeding ages\r\nmore than all his other deeds.\r\n\r\nOutside the cathedral, adjoining the monastery-wall, a commanding terrace\r\nis built upon the verge of the precipice. Leaning from its edge, we gazed\r\nalmost vertically into the orange-groves below, where the ripe fruit glowed\r\nwith the brightness of a flame contrasted with the darkness of the foliage.\r\nFar and wide were spread the fruit-gardens over the plain, to where the\r\nmountains towered up in the east, and northward to the city and the sea. It\r\nis one of those bright and satisfying scenes from which a traveller can\r\nhardly turn away without a tinge of bitterness in the thought of never\r\nseeing them again.\r\n\r\nThe drive back to the town was pleasantly varied by a detour which brought\r\nus to the Capuchin monastery and the Saracenic villa of La Ziza. The vaults\r\nof the monastery are mentioned as one of the interesting sights, but it\r\nmust be a very ghoulish soul that would take pleasure in them. The horrors\r\nof the more famous Capuchin vaults at Rome are tame in comparison with\r\nthese. There the ornaments are skulls and skeletons in a tolerable state of\r\ncleanliness: here the departed brethren have been subjected to some\r\nmummifying process, and as they lie piled in hideous confusion their\r\nwithered faces stare horribly in the twilight of the cellar. Numerous\r\nfiery-eyed cats run about with much scratching and scrabbling over the dry\r\nbodies, making the place none the pleasanter with their uncanny wails. A\r\nvery brief visit is sufficient.\r\n\r\nLa Ziza, the only Saracenic house of this region which is still inhabited,\r\nis simply a massive, battlemented tower of unmistakably Arabian appearance.\r\nThe outside walls are adorned with the depressed panels characteristic of\r\nthe Saracenic style, but within the Oriental look has almost vanished under\r\nthe repairs and decorations of many centuries. Only the lofty hallway,\r\narched above with a kind of honeycomb vaulting and cooled by a little\r\ncascade of water rushing through it, retains much of the Oriental beauty,\r\nand seems like a hall of the Alhambra. Along a wall of the vestibule runs\r\nan inscription in Arabic which has been a puzzle to Orientalists, and of\r\nwhich no undisputed interpretation is given. The palace was built as a\r\ncountry pleasure-house by one of the Saracenic princes of Palermo, and can\r\nbe little less than a thousand years old; indeed, an inscription on its\r\nwalls, inscribed by one of the Spanish proprietors, claims for the house an\r\nantiquity of eleven hundred years.\r\n\r\nFrom the battlements of La Ziza one has the loveliest near view of Palermo\r\nand the plain of the Golden Shell. An enthusiastic verse, written over the\r\ndoorway of the palace, declares it to be the most beautiful scene upon our\r\nplanet, and while the eyes are resting on the view it is easy to believe\r\nthe poet; but many of the mountain-views about the city surpass it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most attractive of the mountain-excursions from Palermo is that\r\nto the monastery of San Martino. At a height of seventeen hundred feet\r\nabove the city, in a lonely spot, the monastery stands on another flank of\r\nthe mountain on which Monreale is also perched. The mule-path from the\r\nsuburban village of Boccadifalco to San Martino would be worth traversing\r\nfor its own wild beauty alone. It first enters a gorge between grand\r\ncliffs: then, climbing a rocky ascent which commands a superb view of the\r\nplain, it runs through a fruitful valley, where the monastery suddenly\r\nappears in the front.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Palermo.]\r\n\r\nThe monastery of San Martino has been the wealthiest in Sicily. The\r\nentrance-hall is on a scale of regal magnificence, adorned with\r\nmany-colored marbles. The brethren were all of noble extraction. Though the\r\nexternal architecture of the building is not in the best taste, the grand\r\nscale on which it is built, and still more the wild, picturesque site, give\r\nto the monastery a beauty which even an Italian architect of the last\r\ncentury could not disfigure. Ascending a grand staircase with balustrades\r\nof purple marble, an upper hall is reached, from which the wonderful view\r\nmay be seen to the best advantage. Turning the eye to the north and east\r\nacross the savage-looking mountains, a short reach of the coast is seen,\r\nand beyond is the boundless expanse of sea, dotted on the horizon by the\r\nvolcanoes of the AEolian Islands, which lie more than a hundred miles away.\r\nThe abbey abounds in pictures by masters of the seventeenth century, and\r\nthere is also a museum of Greek and Saracenic remains, but nothing within\r\nthe walls compares with the interest of the window-views.\r\n\r\nAttractive as are the sights of Palermo, most of them must be passed over\r\nor very hastily visited if the tour of the island is to be made in a month,\r\nfor the Greek cities beyond demand a greater share of time by reason of\r\ntheir immense antiquity and the grandeur of their remains.\r\n\r\nBeing well prepared for the inland journey, and eager to see antiquities so\r\nlittle known to the outer world, one question arose to give us pause--a\r\nquestion which every year keeps thousands of prudent tourists from\r\nexploring a country as full of glorious scenery as Switzerland, possessing\r\nmore of Greek antiquities than Greece itself, and a far lovelier winter\r\nclimate than Italy--\"Is it safe?\" The doubtful question whether this\r\nrarely-attempted journey should be accomplished was settled by the friendly\r\nadvice of the courteous consul of the United States at Palermo. That advice\r\nmay be of use to travellers in the future: it was to the effect that for\r\ntwo American gentlemen travelling alone and without ostentation through\r\nSicily there is no more danger of capture or violent death than in any\r\ncivilized country. It is admitted that highway robbery is not impossible,\r\nas in many places nearer home, but the simple preventive is to carry as\r\nlittle ready money as possible over the short spaces of unsettled country,\r\nand to forward superfluous baggage by steamer. That there are banditti in\r\ncertain districts of the island no one denies, but their object is the\r\ncapture of wealthy Sicilians, whose ransom is sure and ample, while that of\r\na foreigner is uncertain and necessarily long delayed.\r\n\r\nA dark afternoon found us comfortably established in the best seats of an\r\nold-fashioned stage-coach in front of the general post-office of Palermo,\r\nwhence the stage-lines radiate to the various parts of the island. After\r\nthe long deliberation which seems to characterize all business (especially\r\nofficial business) transacted outside of England and America, the mail-bags\r\nwere delivered, and our journey began in the midst of a shower descending\r\nwith all the tremendous impetuosity of a semi-tropical rainy season. The\r\ncumbersome vehicle dashed on with considerable spirit through streets\r\nalmost emptied by the violence of the shower, and out through the broad\r\narch of the stately Porta Nuova crowded by multitudes seeking shelter from\r\nthe storm. Late twilight found us at the end of the first stage in\r\nMonreale. From thence onward the journey continued for a while through\r\npitchy darkness. The broad highway is engineered with admirable skill along\r\nthe sides of mountains and over deep ravines, through a region of most\r\nuncommon beauty, it is said, but now hidden from us by the impenetrable\r\ngloom. However, as the night advanced the clouds rolled away with\r\nsurprising suddenness, and left a bright moon rising over the mountains. We\r\nbegan to see something of the beautifully varied country, though viewing\r\nit at a disadvantage through the narrow window of a covered coach. Wherever\r\nthe rugged nature of the country permitted every rood of ground was under\r\nexquisite cultivation, and already had its first soft covering of springing\r\nvegetation. The night-air was sweet with the spring-like odors of\r\nfreshly-turned earth and of wild-flowers: from time to time white masses of\r\nflower-laden almond trees flashed past the window, looking in the moonlight\r\nwonderfully like the snow-drifts which at this season line the roads in New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONVENT OF SAN MARINO, NEAR PALERMO.]\r\n\r\nAfter nightfall the surface of the rich and well-cultivated country seemed\r\nas solitary as a wilderness: not a creature was stirring along the road.\r\nThe intense silence of the night was broken only by the hum of our\r\ncoach-wheels and the sharp snap of hoofs from our cavalry guard. How unlike\r\nwere all the surroundings to those of an ordinary modern night-journey over\r\nthe mail-routes of Europe! The primitive conveyance, the quiet of the\r\nlonely road, the arms of the attendant troop of horsemen flashing in the\r\nlight of the moon,--all the concomitants of an old-time night-journey\r\nseemed to carry us back from the age of railroads to an earlier time.\r\n\r\nEleven drowsy hours of staging, and then a long, slow ascent, brought us up\r\nto the hilltop where stands the village of Calatafimi. The chief inn of the\r\ntown is probably not surpassed in Europe in the number of its small\r\ndiscomforts, animate and inanimate, but it must be made the base of\r\noperations for visiting the ruins of Segesta. The remnant of the night\r\nspent in sleep prepared us for our investigations on the following day. It\r\nwas pleasant, rising in the cool early morning, to step out from the\r\ncomfortless interior of the tavern to enjoy on a southern balcony the\r\ntemperate warmth of the low sun and to look down on the lovely landscape.\r\nBefore us lay a fertile rolling country clad with verdure, and rising\r\ngradually upward toward the south to an elevation deserving to be called a\r\nmountain from its great height, yet from its gentle slope and cultivated\r\nsides rather to be called a hill. A field near the crest of that distant\r\nhill, marked only by a few white crosses, is a spot memorable in Sicilian\r\nhistory, for there lie the heroes who fell fighting with Garibaldi for the\r\nunity of Italy on May 15, 1860. Sicily has in all ages been a battle-ground\r\nfor the contending races of two continents: on Sicilian soil Athens\r\nreceived her most disabling blow, and here too the Punic power was broken;\r\nyet there is hardly one among the battlefields of Sicily upon which greater\r\ndestinies have been settled than on this field of Calatafimi.\r\n\r\nBefore the morning was far advanced we started out in search of the village\r\ncure, the unfailing friend of strangers, that we might inquire of him about\r\nthe safety of visiting the ruin and in regard to the pleasantest way of\r\nreaching it. Picking our way about through the mud of the squalid village,\r\nwe at length found the old gentleman just coming from his little church on\r\nthe side of the castle hill at the end of the town. Filled with unfeigned\r\ndelight that the monotony of his existence should be broken by the advent\r\nof two foreigners, especially such living wonders as Americans, the benign\r\npriest took a lively interest in our case, gave us the information for\r\nwhich we had asked, vouching for the safety of the country, and begged us\r\nto walk on with him. For five minutes we followed on together the road cut\r\nin the hillside beneath the walls of the Saracenic citadel, our companion\r\nall the while talking vehemently, and helping out our lame knowledge of the\r\nlanguage with gestures so dramatic that an understanding of his words was\r\nhardly needed. Suddenly the road curved round the side of the hill; we\r\nstood on the floor of a deserted quarry; the old man ceased speaking and\r\npointed forward: \"_Ecco!_\" Before us the hill dropped abruptly down in a\r\nprecipice: far below a deep valley spread out before our eyes, \"fair as the\r\ngarden of the Lord.\" As the light of the morning sun streamed down through\r\nits length, bringing out in great brilliancy the fresh green of spring, it\r\nlooked like a paradise of luxuriant vegetation. The gray of olive trees and\r\nthe darkness of orange-groves contrasted with the color of springing\r\nplants, and everywhere were scattered the pink-and-white plumes of the\r\nblossoming almonds. Beyond the valley a rugged, saddle-shaped mountain\r\nrose to an imposing height, and upon the summit line stood in solitary\r\nmajesty the Doric temple of Segesta, each column in clear relief against\r\nthe blue of the sky. It is so far removed from all abodes of men, standing\r\nalone for thousands of years in the region of the clouds--so grand in its\r\nsevere and noble outlines--so venerable in its mysterious antiquity--so\r\nblended with the natural beauties of the place,--that it seems rather to\r\nbelong to the power that raised the mountains than to any workmanship of\r\nman. The world cannot show a more wonderful example of art exquisitely\r\nharmonized with the grandeur of natural scenery.\r\n\r\nEager for a closer view of the temple, we returned immediately to the town,\r\nand, being provided with a guide and a beast, were soon on the way down the\r\nwinding road to the valley. A bridle-path diverged from the main road: an\r\navenue of over-arching olive trees shaded the way, and on all sides here,\r\nas everywhere through the country, the orange-crop loaded the trees almost\r\nto breaking--the most beautiful of all crops as the fruit hangs upon the\r\nbranches. As we passed the lower slopes dotted with browsing sheep, and\r\nbegan the rugged ascent of the mountain on which the temple stands, the\r\npathway crept up the edge of a profound gorge: it was a perilous way,\r\nclinging close to the edge of the bank, and at some points, where we could\r\nlook down a thousand feet to the torrent below, the path was so narrow and\r\nbroken that even our sure-footed mountain-donkeys hesitated to advance. The\r\npicturesque but hard climb at length came to an end at the edge of the\r\nbroad, flattened summit of the mountain. Again the temple suddenly came in\r\nsight, but now near at hand. The mountain-shepherds have planted with wheat\r\nthe level of the summit, and the pale yellow of the volcanic rock from\r\nwhich the temple is built harmonizes well with the color of its\r\nsurroundings. It cannot be called a ruin. It stands as the builders left it\r\nin the fifth century before Christ. Not a column is broken, not a stone has\r\nfallen. The interior was never finished, but the outside is perfect.\r\n\r\nThe pure outlines of a Doric temple are beautiful in any situation, but the\r\nimpression which this one made upon us in the bright morning sunlight,\r\nstanding in the midst of verdure and flowers on the brink of that\r\nstupendous chasm and overlooking that glorious country, is not a thing to\r\nbe conveyed in words.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the temple is comprised in its size, antiquity and beauty,\r\nfor no mention of it is made in history. Its approximate age is inferred\r\nfrom the internal evidence of the structure. The subjection of the city of\r\nSegesta from B. C. 409 to the powers of Carthage and Rome successively, and\r\nthe subsequent decline of its own power and wealth, render it certain that\r\nno such work as this temple would have been undertaken after that date:\r\nmoreover, the purity of its simple Doric form places it in the earlier ages\r\nof Sicilian history. The Carthaginian invasion of the island was doubtless\r\nthe event which arrested the building. Cicero has described a wonderful\r\nstatue of Diana in bronze which the people of Segesta showed him with pride\r\nas the greatest ornament of their city: it was of colossal size and\r\nfaultless beauty, belonging to the best period of Greek art. As the statue\r\nwas in existence before the Carthaginian invasion, it seems to me highly\r\nimprobable that the citizens of Segesta would have built so grand a temple\r\nfor any other purpose than to enshrine their most admired and revered\r\nstatue and to make it a place of worship for Diana. This theory may explain\r\nin part the reason why the building was arrested, for it is known that the\r\nimage was stolen to adorn the city of Carthage,[A] and its loss, as well as\r\nthe subsequent poverty of Segesta, would have been a sufficient reason for\r\nceasing to build a temple to contain it. Diana's worshippers of old must\r\nhave looked upon these lovely mountain-ranges as an abode dear to the queen\r\nof the nymphs and the hunter's patron deity. It seems as if nothing less\r\nthan the presence of the mountain-goddess lingering round her shrine could\r\nhave kept the temple in its marvellous perfection through the lapse of\r\nages in a land of wars and earthquakes. The houses of the neighboring city\r\nare indistinguishably levelled with the earth, but hardly a stone of the\r\nsacred building is displaced.\r\n\r\nThe position of the temple was outside and below the limits of the ancient\r\ncity. The mountain-ridge rises near at hand to a somewhat greater height,\r\nand terminates in a peak, on the summit and sides of which the town was\r\nbuilt. Warned by the decline of the sun, we turned from the Segestan house\r\nof worship and began to climb the slope toward the Segestan place of\r\namusement: the Greek theatre still remains with little loss or change. The\r\nascent was interrupted by many lingering backward looks toward the grand\r\ncolonnade as it appeared at fresh points of view from above. Hardly a\r\nliving creature appeared on the lonely heights, except that one wandering\r\nshepherd, seeing the dress of foreigners, came forward to offer his little\r\nstock of coins ploughed from the earth or found in ancient buildings. As\r\nusual, most of the pocketful were corroded beyond recognition, but one\r\npiece bore a noble head executed in the Greek style, and the clear\r\ninscription, [Greek: PANORMITAN], a coin of Panormus; which is, in modern\r\nspeech, Palermo. A few coppers were accepted as an ample equivalent for a\r\ncoin which will not circulate.\r\n\r\nThe scattered fragments of a fortress crown the peak; and immediately\r\nbelow, cut in the solid rock of the western slope, lies the theatre. It is\r\nnot large as compared with buildings of its class at Athens and Syracuse,\r\nyet I believe that in its seating capacity it exceeds any opera-house of\r\nour time. Entering by a ruined stage-door and crossing the orchestra, we\r\nrested on the lower tiers of seats. The great arc, comprising two-thirds of\r\na circle, upon which the spectators were ranged, has still its covering of\r\nfine cut-stone seats, complete except at one extremity. Every part of the\r\ndesolate building gains a new interest when peopled in imagination with its\r\nancient occupants, and when we recall to mind the vast multitudes of many\r\ngenerations who have watched with breathless and solemn interest the\r\nstately progress of Greek tragedy before that ruined _scena_.\r\n\r\nAs we lounged upon the lowest seats, whereon the high dignitaries of the\r\ntown used to sit, and looked across the open space of the orchestra, there\r\nat the centre of its farther side lay the slab which supported the altar of\r\nBacchus, where stood the chorus-leader: near it a line of stone marks the\r\nfront of the stage, and beyond it is spread an expanse of stage-scenery\r\nsuch as no modern royal theatre can boast. The whole broad prospect\r\ncommanded from the colonnade below is seen across the stage of the theatre,\r\nbut widened by the greater height and finished in the foreground by the\r\nmajestic presence of the temple. All the north-western mountains of the\r\nisland are taken in with one glance of the eye: beneath us the valley of\r\nthe little river Scamander opens a long vista northward to the\r\nMediterranean Sea, and far away the port of Castellamare glitters, in\r\ncontrast with the blue, as white as a polished shell upon the shore. Most\r\ndistant among the group of peaks is Mount Eryx, the lonely rock by the sea\r\non whose summit stood the temple of Venus Erycina, more renowned in the\r\nancient world than all other shrines of the goddess.\r\n\r\nWe climbed to the brow of the hill in order to descend through the entire\r\nlength of the city. Hardly one stone is left upon another of all the\r\nstreets through which the Segestans proudly conducted Cicero. Here and\r\nthere appear the circular openings of cisterns which occupied the centres\r\nof ancient courtyards. The stones once hewn and carved which are strewn\r\nover the slope are now reduced to the roughness of boulders, so that one\r\nmight cross the tract and catch no sign that it was once a city. Little has\r\nbeen done to discover what remains lie beneath the surface, but at one\r\npoint, where a small excavation has been made, a heap of fallen Ionic\r\ncolumns cover the fragments of a tomb built on a scale of regal\r\nmagnificence; and a little lower on the mountain two rooms of a house have\r\nbeen exhumed, the floors of which are still covered with beautiful mosaics.\r\n\r\nALFRED T. BACON.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] The statue was restored to Segesta by Scipio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"FOR PERCIVAL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSISSY LOOKS INTO THE MIRROR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA lady's hero generally has ample leisure. He may write novels or poems, or\r\npaint the picture or carve the statue of the season, or he is a statesman\r\nand rules the destinies of nations, or he makes money mysteriously in the\r\ncity, or even, it may be, not less mysteriously on the turf; but he does it\r\nin his odd minutes. That is his characteristic. Perhaps he spends his\r\nmorning in stupendous efforts to gratify a wish expressed in smiling\r\nhopelessness by the heroine; later, he calls on her or he rides with her;\r\nevening comes, he dances with her till the first gray streak of dawn has\r\ntouched the eastern sky. He goes home. His pen flies along the paper--he is\r\nknee-deep in manuscript; he is possessed with burning enthusiasm and\r\nenergy; her features grow in idealized loveliness beneath his chisel, or\r\nthe sunny tide of daylight pours in to irradiate the finished picture as\r\nwell as the exhausted artist with a golden glory. He has a talent for\r\nsitting up. He gets up very early indeed if he is in the country, but he\r\nnever goes to bed early, or when would he achieve his triumphs? Some\r\nthings, it is true, must be done by day, but half an hour will work\r\nwonders. The gigantic intellect is brought to bear on the confidential\r\nclerk: the latter is, as it were, wound up, and the great machine goes on.\r\nOr a hasty telegram arrives as the guests file in to dinner. \"Pardon me,\r\none moment;\" and instantly something is sent off in cipher which shall\r\nchange the face of Europe. Unmoved, the hero returns to the love-making\r\nwhich is the true business of life.\r\n\r\nThere are poetry and romance enough in many an outwardly prosaic life. How\r\noften have we been told this! Nay, we have read stories in which the hero\r\npossesses a season-ticket, and starts from his trim suburban home after an\r\nearly breakfast, to return in due time to dine, perhaps to talk a little\r\n\"shop\" over the meal, and, it may be, even to feel somewhat sleepy in the\r\nevening. But, as far as my experience goes, the day on which the story\r\nopens is the last on which he does all this. That morning he meets the\r\nwoman with the haunting eyes or the old friend who died long ago--did not\r\nthe papers say so?--and whose resurrection includes a secret or two. Or he\r\nis sent for to some out-of-the-way spot in the country where there is a\r\nmysterious business of some kind to be unravelled. At any rate, he needs\r\nhis season-ticket never again, but changes more or less into the hero we\r\nall know.\r\n\r\nIt is hard work for these unresting men, no doubt, yet what is to be done?\r\nUnless the double-shift system can in any way be applied for their relief,\r\nI fear they must continue to toil by night that they may appear to be idle\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, were the hero not altogether heroic, one is tempted to\r\ndoubt if this abundant leisure is quite a gain.\r\n\r\nAddie Blake, planning some bright little scheme which needed a whole day\r\nand an unoccupied squire, said once to Godfrey Hammond, \"You can't think\r\nwhat a comfort it is to get some one who hasn't to go to business every\r\nday. I hate the very name of business! Now, you are always at hand when you\r\nare wanted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"we idle men have a great advantage over the busy ones, no\r\ndoubt; but I think it almost more than counterbalanced by our terrible\r\ndisadvantage.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are at hand when we are not wanted,\" said Godfrey seriously.\r\n\r\nAnd I think he was right. One may have a great liking--nay, something\r\nwarmer than liking--for one's companions in endless idle _tete-a-tetes_,\r\nbut they are perilous nevertheless. Some day the pale ghost--weariness,\r\n_ennui_, dearth of ideas, I hardly know what its true name is--comes into\r\nthe room to see if the atmosphere will suit it, and sits down between you.\r\nYou cannot see the colorless spectre, but are conscious of a slight\r\nexhaustion in the air. Everything requires a little effort--to breathe, to\r\nquestion, to answer, to look up, to appear interested. You feel that it is\r\nyour own fault, perhaps: you would gladly take all the blame if you could\r\nonly take all the burden. Perhaps the failing _is_ yours, but it is your\r\nfault only as it is the fault of an electric eel that after many shocks his\r\npower is weakened and he wants to be left alone to recover it.\r\n\r\nStill, though there may be no fault, it is a terrible thing to feel one's\r\nheart sink suddenly when one's friend pauses for a moment in the doorway as\r\nif about to return. One thinks, If weariness cannot be kept at bay in the\r\nsociety of those we love, where can we be safe from the cold and subtle\r\nblight? As soon as we are conscious of it, it seems to become part of us,\r\nand we shrink from the popular idea of the Hereafter, assured of finding\r\nour spectre even in the courts of heaven.\r\n\r\nGodfrey Hammond expressed the fear of too much companionship in speech,\r\nPercival Thorne in action. He was given to lonely walks if the weather were\r\nfine--to shutting himself in his own room with a book if it were wet. He\r\nwould dream for hours, for I will frankly confess that when he was shut up\r\nwith a book, his book as often as not was in that condition too.\r\n\r\nHis grandfather had complained more than once, \"You don't often come to\r\nBrackenhill, Percival, except to solve the problem of how little you can\r\nsee of us in a given time.\" He did not suspect it, but much of the strong\r\nattraction which drew him to his grandson lay in that very fact. The latter\r\nconfronted him in grave independence, just touched with the courteous\r\ndeference due from youth to age, but nothing more. Mr. Thorne would have\r\nthanked Heaven had the boy been a bit of a spendthrift, but Percival was\r\ntoo wary for that. He did not refuse his grandfather's gifts, but he never\r\nseemed in want of them. They might help him to pleasant superfluities, but\r\nhis attitude said plainly enough, \"I have sufficient for my needs.\" He was\r\nnot to be bought: the very aimlessness of his life secured him from that.\r\nYou cannot earn a man's gratitude by helping him onward in his course when\r\nhe is drifting contentedly round and round. He was not to be bullied, being\r\nconscious of his impregnable position. He was not to be flattered in any\r\nordinary way. It was so evident to him that the life he had chosen must\r\nappear an unwise choice to the majority of his fellow-men that he accepted\r\nany assurance to the contrary as the verdict of a small minority. Nor was\r\nhe conscious of any especial power or originality, so that he could be\r\npleased by being told that he had broken conventional trammels and was a\r\ngreat soul. Mr. Thorne did not know how to conquer him, and could not have\r\nenough of him.\r\n\r\nIt is needful to note how the day after the agricultural show was spent at\r\nBrackenhill.\r\n\r\nGodfrey Hammond left by an early train. Mrs. Middleton came down to see\r\nabout his breakfast with a splitting headache. The poor old lady's\r\nsuffering was evident, and Sissy's suggestion that it was due to their\r\nhaving walked about so much in the broiling sun the day before was\r\nunanimously accepted. Mrs. Middleton countenanced the theory, though she\r\nprivately attributed it to a sleepless night which had followed a\r\nconversation with Hammond about Horace.\r\n\r\nPercival vanished immediately after breakfast. As soon as he had\r\nascertained that there were no especial plans for the day, he slipped\r\nquietly away with his hands in his pockets, strolled through the park,\r\nwhistling dreamily as he went, and passing out into the road, crossed it\r\nand made straight for the river. He lay on the grass for half an hour or\r\nso, studying the growth of willows and the habits of dragon-flies, and\r\nthen sauntered along the bank. Had he gone to the left it would have led\r\nhim past Langley Wood to Fordborough. He went to the right.\r\n\r\nIt was a gentle little river, which had plenty of time to spare, and amused\r\nitself with wandering here and there, tracing a bright maze of curves and\r\nunexpected turns. At times it would linger in shady pools, where, half\r\nasleep, it seemed to hesitate whether it cared to go on to the county-town\r\nat all that day. But Percival defied it to have more leisure than he had,\r\nand followed the silvery clue till all at once he found himself face to\r\nface with an artist who sat by the river-side sketching.\r\n\r\nThe young man looked up with a half smile as Percival came suddenly upon\r\nhim from behind a clump of alders. A remark of some kind, were it but\r\nconcerning the weather, was inevitable. It was made, and was followed by\r\nothers. Young Thorne looked, admired and questioned, and they drifted into\r\nan aimless talk about the art which the painter loved. Even to an outsider,\r\nsuch as Percival, it was full of color and grace and a charm half\r\nunderstood, vaguely suggestive of a world of beauty--not far off and\r\ninaccessible, but underlying the common, every-day world of which we are at\r\ntimes a little weary. It was as if one should tell us of virtue new and\r\nstrange in the often-turned earth of our garden-plot. Percival was rather\r\napt to analyze his pains and pleasures, but his ideal was enjoyment which\r\nshould defy analysis, and he found something of it that morning in the\r\nsummer weather and his new friend's talk.\r\n\r\nIt was past noon. The young artist looked at his watch and ascertained the\r\nfact. \"Do you live near here?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nPercival shook his head: \"I live anywhere. I am a wanderer on the face of\r\nthe earth. But my grandfather lives in that gray house over yonder, and I\r\nam free to come and go as I choose. I am staying there now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brackenhill, do you mean? That fine old house on the side of the hill? I\r\nam lodging at the farm down there, and the farmer--\"\r\n\r\n\"John Collins,\" said Percival.\r\n\r\n\"Entertains me every night with stories of its magnificence. Since we have\r\nsmoked our pipes together I have learnt that Brackenhill is the eighth\r\nwonder of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite,\" said Thorne. \"But it is a good old manor-house, and, thank\r\nHeaven, my ancestors for a good many generations wasted their money, and\r\nhad none to spare for restoring and beautifying. I don't mean my\r\ngrandfather: he wouldn't hurt it. It's a quaint old place. Come some\r\nafternoon and look at it. He shall show you his pictures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" the other said, but he hesitated and looked at his unfinished\r\nwork. \"I should like, but I don't quite know. The fact is, when I have done\r\nfor to-day I'm to have old Collins's gig and drive into Fordborough to see\r\nif there are any letters for me. I am not sure I shall not have to leave\r\nthe first thing to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I have made you waste your time this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" said the young artist with the brightest smile. \"I'm\r\nnot much given to bemoaning past troubles, and I shall be in a very bad way\r\nindeed before I begin to find fault with past pleasures. I may not find my\r\nletter after all, and in that case I should like very much to look you up.\r\nTo-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray do.\" The tone was unmistakably cordial.\r\n\r\n\"Your grandfather's name is Thorne, isn't it? Shall I ask for young Mr.\r\nThorne?\"\r\n\r\n\"Percival Thorne,\" was the quick correction: \"I have a cousin.\"\r\n\r\nThey shook hands, but as Thorne turned away the other called after him: \"I\r\nsay! is there any name to that little wood out there, looking like a dark\r\ncloud on the green?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--Langley Wood.\" Percival nodded a second farewell, and went on his way\r\npondering. And this was the subject of his thoughts: \"Then, my brother, I\r\nhave to go through Langley Wood to-morrow evening, and I am afraid to go\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nOf course he had not forgotten his promise to Addie, but having made his\r\narrangements and worked it all out in his own mind, he had dismissed it\r\nfrom his thoughts. Now, however, it rose up before him as a slightly\r\ndisagreeable puzzle.\r\n\r\nWhat on earth did Addie want toward nine at night in Langley Wood? The day\r\nbefore, in haste to answer her request and anxiety not to betray her, he\r\nhad not considered whether the service he had promised to render were\r\npleasant to him or not. In very truth, he was willing to serve Addie, and\r\nhe had professed his willingness the more eagerly that he had expected a\r\nharder task. She asked so slight a thing that only eager readiness could\r\ngive the service any grace at all.\r\n\r\nBut when he came to consider it he half wished that his task had been\r\nharder if it might have been different. He liked Addie, he was ready to\r\nserve her, but he foresaw possible annoyances to them both from her hasty\r\nrequest. He had no confidence in her prudence.\r\n\r\n\"Some silly freak of hers,\" he thought while he walked along, catching at\r\nthe tops of the tall flowering weeds as he went. \"Some silly girlish freak.\r\nWhy didn't she ask Horace? Wouldn't run any risk of getting him into\r\ntrouble, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nDid Horace know? he wondered. \"I'm not going to be made use of by him and\r\nher: they needn't think it!\" vowed Percival in sudden anger. But next\r\nmoment he smiled at his own folly: \"When I have given my word, and must go\r\nif fifty Horaces had planned it! I had better save my resolutions for next\r\ntime.\" He did not think, however, that Horace _did_ know. \"Which makes it\r\nall the worse,\" he reflected. \"A charming complication it will be if I get\r\ninto trouble with him about Addie. Suppose some one sees us? Suppose Mrs.\r\nBlake is down upon me, questioning, and I, pledged to secrecy, haven't a\r\nword to say for myself? Suppose Lottie--Oh, I say, a delightful arrangement\r\nthis is and no mistake!\"\r\n\r\nHe could only hope that no one would see them, and that Addie's mystery\r\nwould prove a harmless one.\r\n\r\nHe got in just as they were sitting down to luncheon. Horace and Sissy had\r\nspent the morning in archery and idleness, Mrs. Middleton in nursing her\r\nheadache. Mr. Thorne was not there.\r\n\r\n\"Been enjoying a little solitude?\" Horace inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Not much of that,\" was the answer. \"A good deal of talk instead.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! did you find a friend out in the fields?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Percival, \"a young artist.\" As he spoke he remembered that he\r\nwas ignorant of his new friend's name. At least he knew it was \"Alf,\" owing\r\nto some story the painter had told: \"I heard my brother calling 'Alf! Alf!'\r\nso I,\" etc. Alf--probably therefore Alfred--surname unknown.\r\n\r\nThey were halfway through their meal when Mr. Thorne came noiselessly in\r\nand took his accustomed place. He was very silent, and had a curiously\r\nintent expression. Horace, who was telling Sissy some trifling story about\r\nhimself (Horace's little stories generally were about himself), finished it\r\nlamely in a lowered voice. Mr. Thorne smiled.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Percival went steadily on with his luncheon, but\r\nHorace pushed away his plate and sipped his sherry. The birds were\r\ntwittering outside in the sunshine, but there was no other sound. It was\r\nlike a breathless little pause of expectation.\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Thorne spoke, in such sweetly courteous tones that they all\r\nknew he meant mischief. \"Are you particularly engaged this afternoon?\" he\r\ninquired of Horace.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all engaged,\" said the young man. His heart gave a great throb.\r\n\r\n\"Then perhaps you could give me a few minutes in the library?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be most--\" Horace began. But he checked himself and said,\r\n\"Certainly. When shall I come?\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as you have finished your luncheon, if that will suit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have finished.\" He drank off his wine, and, without looking at the\r\nothers, walked defiantly to the door, stood aside for his grandfather to\r\npass, and followed him out.\r\n\r\nMrs. Middleton and Sissy exchanged glances. \"Oh, my dear!\" the old lady\r\nexclaimed. \"Oh, I'm so frightened! I am afraid poor Horace is in trouble.\r\nGodfrey Hammond was saying only last night--\"\r\n\r\nShe paused suddenly, looking at Percival. He sat with his back to the\r\nwindow, and the dark face was very dark in the shadow. It was just as well\r\nperhaps, for he was thinking \"Told you so!\" a train of thought which seldom\r\nproduces an agreeable expression.\r\n\r\n\"What did Godfrey Hammond say?\" Sissy asked. But nothing was to be got out\r\nof Aunt Middleton, so they adjourned to the drawing-room to wait for\r\nHorace's return. Percival read the paper; Mrs. Middleton lay on the sofa;\r\nSissy flitted to and fro, now taking up a book, now her work, then at the\r\npiano, playing idly with one hand or singing snatches of her favorite\r\nsongs. There was a mirror in which, looking sideways, she could see herself\r\nreflected as she played and Percival as he read--as much of him, at least,\r\nas was not swallowed up in the _Times_. There is something ghostly about a\r\nlittle picture like this reflected in a glass. It is so silent and yet so\r\nreal: the people stir, look up, their lips move, they have every sign of\r\nlife, but there is no sound. There are noises in the room behind you, but\r\nthe people in the mirror make none. The _Times_ may be rustling and\r\ncrackling elsewhere, but Percival's ghost turns a ghostly paper whence no\r\nsound proceeds. Sissy is playing a little tinkling treble tune, but at the\r\npiano yonder slim white fingers are silently wandering over the ivory keys,\r\nand the girl's eyes look strangely out from the polished surface.\r\n\r\nSissy gazed and mused. Perhaps some day Percival will reign at Brackenhill.\r\nAnd who will sit at that piano where the ghost-girl sits now, and what\r\nsoundless melodies will be played in that silent room?\r\n\r\nSissy's left hand steals down to the bass, striking solemn chords. \"If one\r\ncould but look into the glass,\" she thinks, \"and see the future there, as\r\npeople do in stories! What eyes would look out at me instead of mine? Ah,\r\nwell! If I could but see Percival there I would try to be content, even if\r\nthe girl turned away her face. I _would_ be content. I would! I would!\"\r\n\r\nShe turns resolutely away from the mirror, and begins that old royalist\r\nsong in which yearning for the vanished past and mourning for the dreary\r\npresent cannot triumph over the hope of far-off brightness--\"When the king\r\nenjoys his own again.\" To Mrs. Middleton, to Percival, a mere song--to\r\nSissy a solemn renunciation of all but the one hope. Let her king enjoy his\r\nown, and the rest be as Fate wills.\r\n\r\nThe last note dies away. Moved by a sudden impulse, she lifts her eyes to\r\nthe ghost Percival. He has lowered his paper a little, and is looking at\r\nher with a wondering smile. A voice behind her exclaims, \"Why, Sissy!\" She\r\ndarts across the room to the speaker and pushes the _Times_ away\r\naltogether. \"Percival,\" she says in a low, breathless voice, \"does Miss\r\nLisle play?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lisle!\" He is surprised. \"Oh yes, she plays. But not as well as her\r\nbrother, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And does she sing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I heard her once. But no better than you sang just now. What has come\r\nto you, Sissy? You have found the one thing that was wanting.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Earnestness, depth. You sang it as if your soul and the soul of the song\r\nwere one. Now I can tell you that I fancied you only skimmed over the\r\nsurface of things--like a bird over the sea. I can tell you now, since I\r\nwas wrong.\"\r\n\r\nHer cheeks are glowing. \"And Miss Lisle?\" she says.\r\n\r\n\"What, now, about Miss Lisle?\" He is amused and perplexed at Sissy's\r\npersistence.\r\n\r\n\"She is one of your heroic women;\" and Miss Langton nods her pretty head.\r\n\"Oh, I know! Jael and _Judith_ and Charlotte Corday.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I said anything about Judith: surely _you_ suggested her.\r\nAnd, to tell you the truth, Sissy, I looked in the Apocrypha, and I\r\nthought I liked I her the least of the trio. It wasn't a swift impulse like\r\nJael's, who suddenly saw the tyrant given into her hands, and it wanted the\r\ngrace of Charlotte Corday's utter self-sacrifice and quick death. Judith\r\nhad great honor, and lived to be over a hundred, didn't she? I wonder if\r\nshe often talked about Holofernes when she was eighty or ninety, and about\r\nher triumph--how she was crowned with a garland and led the dance? She ran\r\nan awful risk, no doubt, but she was in awful peril: it was glory or death.\r\nCharlotte Corday had no chance of a triumph: she must have known that\r\nsuccess, as well as failure, meant the death-cart and the guillotine.\r\nJudith seems to have played her part fairly well to the end, I allow, but\r\ndon't you think the praises and the after-life spoil it rather?\"\r\n\r\nSissy, passing lightly over Percival's views about Charlotte Corday and the\r\nwidow of a hundred and five who was mourned by all Israel, pounced on a\r\nmore interesting avowal: \"So you looked Judith out and studied her? Oh,\r\nPercival!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sissy, shall I tell you how many times I have seen Miss Lisle?\" He\r\nwas answering her arch glance rather than her spoken question. \"How few\r\ntimes, I should say. Twice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've made up _my_ mind about people when I've only seen them once,\" said\r\nSissy, apparently addressing the carpet.\r\n\r\n\"Very likely: some people have that power,\" said Percival. \"Besides, seeing\r\nthem once may mean that you had a good long interview under favorable\r\ncircumstances. Now,\" with a smile, \"shall I tell you all that Miss Lisle\r\nand I said to each other in our two meetings?\" He paused, encountering\r\nSissy's eyes, brilliantly and wickedly full of meaning.\r\n\r\n\"What! do you remember every word? Oh, Percival!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said Mrs. Middleton, lifting her head from the cushion: \"listen!\r\nisn't that Horace?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so;\" and Percival stooped for the _Times_, which had fallen on the\r\nfloor. Sissy stood with her hand on his chair, making no attempt to conceal\r\nher anxiety. The old lady noted her parted lips and eager eyes. \"Ah! she\r\ndoes care for Horace. I knew it! I knew it!\" she thought.\r\n\r\nHe came in, looking white and angry: his mouth was sternly set, and there\r\nwas a fierce spark in his gray eyes. Mrs. Middleton beckoned him to her\r\nsofa, and would have drawn the proud head down to her with a tender whisper\r\nof \"Tell me, my dear.\" But the young fellow straightened himself and faced\r\nthem all as he stood by her side. She clasped and fondled his passive hand.\r\n\"What is the matter, Horace?\" she said at last.\r\n\r\n\"As it happens, there is nothing much the matter,\" he replied,\r\n\r\n\"You look as if a good deal might be the matter,\" said Sissy.\r\n\r\nHe made no answer for the moment. Then he looked at her with a curious sort\r\nof smile: \"Sissy, when we were little--when you were very little indeed--do\r\nyou remember old Rover?\"\r\n\r\n\"That curly dog? Oh yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I used to have him in a string sometimes, and take him out: it was great\r\nfun,\" said Horace pensively. \"I liked to feel him all alive, scampering and\r\ntugging at the end of the string. It was best of all, I think, to give him\r\nan unexpected jerk just when he was going to sniff at something, and take\r\nhim pretty well off his legs: he was so astonished and disappointed. But it\r\nwas very grand too, if he would but make up his mind he wanted to go one\r\nway, to pull at him and _make_ him go just the opposite. He was obstinate,\r\nwas old Rover, but that was the fun of it. I was obstinate too, and the\r\nstronger. How long has he been dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know--twelve or thirteen years. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it as long as that? Well, I dare say it is. It has occurred to me\r\nto-day for the first time that perhaps it was rather hard on Rover now and\r\nthen.--Aunt Harriet, why did you let me have the poor old fellow and\r\nill-use him?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear boy, what _do_ you mean? I don't think you were ever cruel--not\r\nreally cruel, you know. Children always will be heedless, but I think\r\nRover was fond of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt it,\" said Horace.\r\n\r\n\"But what do you mean?\" The old lady was fairly perplexed. \"What makes you\r\nthink of having poor old Rover in a string to-day? I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which things are an allegory.\" Horace looked more kindly down at the\r\nsuffering face, and attempted to smile. \"It was very nice then, but to-day\r\nI'm the dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"String pulled tight?\" said Percival.\r\n\r\n\"Jerked.\" He disengaged his hand. \"I think I'll go and have a cigar in the\r\npark.\" Percival was going to rise, but Horace as he passed pressed his\r\nfingers on his shoulder: \"No, old fellow! not to-day--many thanks. You\r\nlecture me, you know, and generally I don't care a rap, so you are quite\r\nwelcome. But to-day I'm a little sore, rubbed up the wrong way: I might\r\ntake it seriously. Another time.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he departed, leaving his lecturer to reflect on this brilliant result\r\nof all his outpourings of wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nIN LANGLEY WOOD.\r\n\r\nAt Brackenhill they invariably dined at six o'clock, nor was the meal a\r\nlengthy one. Mr. Thorne drank little wine, and Horace was generally only\r\ntoo happy to escape to the drawing-room at the earliest opportunity.\r\nPercival could very well dine at home and yet be true to his rendezvous in\r\nLangley Wood.\r\n\r\nAs the time drew near he became thoughtful and, to tell the truth, a little\r\nout of temper. He liked his dinner, and Addie Blake interfered with his\r\nquiet enjoyment of it. He would have chosen to lie on the sofa in the cool,\r\nquaint, rose-scented drawing-room, and get Sissy to sing to him. Instead of\r\nwhich he must tramp three miles along a dusty white road that July evening\r\nto meet a girl he didn't particularly want to see, and to hear a secret\r\nwhich he didn't much want to know, and which he distinctly didn't want to\r\nbe bound to keep. Decidedly a bore!\r\n\r\nIt was only twenty minutes past seven when they joined the ladies. Sissy\r\nrepresented the latter force, Aunt Middleton having gone to lie down in the\r\nhope of being better later in the evening. Mr. Thorne fidgeted about the\r\nroom for a minute, and then went off to the library, whereupon Horace\r\nstretched himself with a sigh of relief. \"Come out, Sissy, and have a turn\r\nin the garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Percival,\" she hesitated, \"what are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't think about me: I must go out for a little while.\" He left them on\r\nthe terrace and started on his mysterious errand. As he let himself out\r\ninto the road by a little side-gate of which he had pocketed the key, it\r\nwas five-and-twenty minutes to eight. He had abundance of time. It was not\r\nthree miles to the white gate into Langley Wood, a little more than three\r\nmiles to the milestone beyond which he was on no account to go, and he had\r\nalmost an hour to do it in. Nevertheless, he started on his walk like a man\r\nin haste.\r\n\r\nThe great Fordborough agricultural show lasted two days, and on the second\r\nthe price of admission was considerably reduced. It had occurred to\r\nPercival that the roads in every direction would probably be crowded with\r\npeople making their way home--people who would have had more beer than was\r\ngood for them. Addie would never think of such a possibility. It was true\r\nthat the road from Fordborough which led past Brackenhill would be quieter\r\nthan any other, but still young Thorne was seriously uneasy as he strode\r\nalong. It was also true that he met hardly any one as he went, but even\r\nthat failed to reassure him. \"A little too early for them to have come so\r\nfar, I suppose,\" was his comment to himself: \"at any rate, she shall not\r\nwait for me.\"\r\n\r\nHe passed the white gate, having encountered only a few stragglers, but\r\nbefore he reached the milestone he saw Addie Blake coming along the road to\r\nmeet him.\r\n\r\nShe was flushed, eager, excited, and looked even handsomer than usual.\r\nPercival would never fall in love with Addie. That was very certain, but\r\nthe certainty did not prevent a quick thrill of admiration which tingled\r\nthrough his blood as she advanced in her ripe dark beauty to meet him. By\r\nit, as by a charm, the service which had been almost a weariness was\r\ntransmuted to a happy privilege, and the half-reluctant squire became\r\nwilling and devoted.\r\n\r\n\"You are more than punctual,\" was his greeting.\r\n\r\nShe smiled as she held out her hand: \"I may say the same of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was anxious,\" he confessed. \"The roads are not likely to be very quiet\r\nto-day. And after sunset--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Addie. \"No doubt it seems strange to you that I should choose\r\nthis day and this time--\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly know what I should have done if I had seen nothing of you when I\r\nreached the milestone,\" he went on, interrupting her. His curiosity was\r\nawakened now that he was so close to Addie's little mystery, but he was\r\nanxious that she should not feel bound to tell him anything she would\r\nrather keep to herself--very anxious that she should understand that he\r\nwould not pry into her secrets.\r\n\r\n\"If you had gone much farther you would have missed me,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Which way did you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not come straight from home. Do you see that little red house? I am\r\ndrinking tea there, and spending a quiet evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"How very pleasant!\" said Percival. \"And who has the privilege of\r\nentertaining you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Wardlaw. She is the widow of an officer--quite young. She is a friend\r\nof mine: she lives with an invalid aunt, an old Mrs. Watson.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what does Mrs. Wardlaw think of your taking a little stroll by\r\nyourself in the evening?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Wardlaw asked me there on purpose. Yesterday I saw her at the show,\r\nand gave her a little note as we shook hands. This morning came an\r\ninvitation to me to go and drink tea there. I told mamma and Lottie I\r\nshould go--papa is out--so one of the servants walked there with me at\r\nhalf-past six, and will call for me again at ten or a little after.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very ingeniously managed,\" said Percival. \"And the invalid aunt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Went up to her room and left Mary and me to our devices,\" smiled Addie. \"A\r\ndelightful old lady. Ah, here is the wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall probably have this part of our walk to ourselves,\" Percival\r\nremarked as he swung the gate open. \"People going home from the show are\r\nnot likely to stop to take a turn in Langley Wood.\"\r\n\r\nThe sound of a rattling cart and shouts of discordant laughter, mixed with\r\nwhat was intended for a song, came along the road they had just quitted.\r\nAddie took a few hurried steps along the path, which curved enough to hide\r\nher from observation in a moment. Safe behind a screen of leaves, she\r\npaused: \"What horrible people! Is that a sample of what I may expect as I\r\ngo back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear so,\" said Percival. \"I shall see you safe to Mrs. Wardlaw's door.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall see me safe if you have good eyes,\" she answered. \"But you will\r\nnot go to the door with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he said. \"Mrs. Wardlaw is only half trusted?\"\r\n\r\nAddie smiled: \"What people don't know they can't let out, can they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray understand that you are quite at liberty to apply that very\r\nwise--mark me, that very wise--discovery of yours to my case,\" said Thorne,\r\nlooking straight at her. \"You talked about good eyes just now. Mine are\r\ngood or bad as it suits me.\" At any rate, they were earnest as they met\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\"Don't shut them on my account,\" said Addie. \"No, Percival: you are not\r\nlike Mrs. Wardlaw. I mean to tell you all about it.\"\r\n\r\nBut for a moment she did not speak. They were fairly in the wood; the trees\r\nwere arching high above their heads; their steps were noiseless on the turf\r\nbelow; outside were warmth and daylight still, but here the shadows and the\r\ncoolness of the night. A leathern-winged bat flitted across their path\r\nthrough the gathering dusk. \"They always look like ghosts,\" said Addie.\r\n\"Doesn't it seem, Percival, as if the night had come upon us unawares?\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke they reached a little open space. The path forked right and\r\nleft. \"Which way?\" said Thorne.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, I'm sure. There's a cottage on the farther side of the wood,\r\ntoward the river--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that your destination? To the right, then.\" And to the right they went.\r\n\r\n\"When you promised to help me,\" Addie began, \"do you remember what you\r\nsaid? I was to consider you as--\" She paused, fixing her questioning eyes\r\non him.\r\n\r\n\"As a brother. What then? Have I failed in my duty already?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, smiling: \"Percival, what do you think that means to\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's a difficult question. Of course we who have no brothers can\r\nonly imagine--we cannot know. But I have sometimes fancied that the idea we\r\nattach to the word brother is higher because no commonplace reality has\r\never stepped in to spoil it. For it is an evident fact that some people\r\nhave brothers who are prosaic, and even disagreeable, while all the noble\r\nbrothers of history and romance are ours. We may take Lord Tresham for our\r\nideal (you remember Tresham in _A Blot in the 'Scutcheon?_), and declare\r\nwith him--\r\n\r\n    I think, am sure, a brother's love exceeds\r\n    All the world's love in its unworldliness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" said Addie. \"You are going into the question much too\r\nenthusiastically and much too poetically. I don't know anything about your\r\nTresham. And you mustn't class me with yourself, 'we who have no brothers.'\r\nI have one, Percival.\"\r\n\r\n\"A brother? You have one? Why, I always fancied--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, a half-brother.\" Addie made this concession to strict truth with\r\nsomething of reluctance in her tone, as if she did not like to own that her\r\nbrother could possibly have been any nearer than he was. \"It is my brother\r\nI am going to meet to-night.\"\r\n\r\nPercival, fluent on the subject of brothers in general, was so astonished\r\nat the idea of this particular brother or half-brother that he said \"Oh!\"\r\n\r\n\"Papa married twice,\" Addie explained--\"the first time when he was very\r\nyoung. I don't think his first wife was _quite_ a lady,\" she said, lowering\r\nher voice as if the beeches might be given to gossiping.\r\n\r\nPercival would not have been happy as a dweller in the Palace of Truth. He\r\nthought, \"Then Mr. Blake's two wives were alike in _one_ respect.\"\r\n\r\n\"And though Oliver was a dear boy,\" she went on, \"he hasn't been very\r\nsteady. He has had a good deal of money at one time or another, and wasted\r\nit; and he and mamma don't get on at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I dare say not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally, she thinks more about Lottie and me; and Oliver has been very\r\ntiresome. He was to be in the business with papa, but he didn't do\r\nanything, and he got terribly into debt, and then he ran away and enlisted.\r\nPapa bought him off, and found him something else to do; but mamma was\r\ndreadfully vexed: she said it was a disgrace to the family.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he do better after that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much,\" Addie owned. \"In fact, I think he has spent most of his time\r\nsince then in running away and enlisting. I really believe he has been in a\r\ndozen regiments. We were always having to write to him, 'Private Oliver\r\nBlake, Number so and so, C company, such a regiment.' It didn't look well\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\n(Addie, as she spoke, remembered how her mother used to sneer, \"No doubt\r\nsome day you'll meet your _brother_ in a red jacket with a little cane, his\r\ncap very much on one side, and a tail of nursemaids wheeling their\r\nperambulators after him.\" Such remarks had been painful to Addie, but even\r\nthen she had felt that Mrs. Blake had cause to complain.)\r\n\r\n\"He was always bought off, I suppose?\" said Percival.\r\n\r\n\"Once papa declared he wouldn't. Oliver went on very quietly for a little\r\nwhile, and was to be a corporal. Then he wrote and said he was going to\r\ndesert that day week, and he was afraid it might be very awkward for him\r\nafterward, especially if he ever enlisted again, but he would take his\r\nchance sooner than stop. Papa knew he would do it, so he had to buy him off\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"But is this going on for ever?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: for the last three years Oliver has been in dreadful disgrace, I don't\r\nexactly know why, and we were not allowed to mention his name at home. But\r\nI don't care,\" said Addie impetuously: \"if he were ever so foolish, and if\r\nhe had enlisted in every regiment under the sun, he's my brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Lottie? Does she stand by him as valiantly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oliver is nothing to Lottie: he never was. He is nine years older than she\r\nis, and when she would really begin to remember him he and mamma were\r\nalways quarrelling. Besides, he always petted me--not Lottie. And now she\r\ndespises him because he doesn't stick to anything and get on. No--poor old\r\nNoll is _my_ brother, only mine. No one else cares for him, except papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blake hasn't given him up, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he is angry with Oliver when they are apart, but he always forgives\r\nhim when they meet. He was really angry this last time, but Oliver wrote to\r\nhim, and they made it up. Only, my poor old Noll is to be sent over the sea\r\nto Canada with a man papa knows something of.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this is good-bye? But surely they can't mind your meeting him before\r\nhe goes?\"\r\n\r\n\"They do,\" said Addie. \"Papa and mamma saw him in London ten days ago, and\r\nhe was only forgiven on condition that he went away quietly and said\r\nnothing to any one. As if he wasn't sure to tell me! Mamma knows how it has\r\nbeen before: she thinks if papa or I saw him alone he might get round us,\r\nand then he wouldn't go. If he is steady and does well there, he is to come\r\nand see us all in two years.\"\r\n\r\n\"That isn't very long, is it?\" said Percival cheerfully. It was evident to\r\nhim that this black sheep would be much better away.\r\n\r\n\"Long! Oh no! Only, you see, Oliver _won't_ do well unless there's\r\nsomething very converting in Canadian air. So I may as well say good-bye to\r\nhim, mayn't I? Mind, Percival, you are not to think he's wicked. He won't\r\ndo anything dreadful. He'll spend all the money he can get, and then drift\r\naway somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"A sort of Prodigal Son,\" Thorne suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You won't understand him--how should you? You are always wise and\r\nwell-behaved, and a credit to every one--more like the son who stayed at\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not an attractive character,\" was his reply. And he remembered Horace a\r\nfew hours before: \"Not to-day, old fellow: you lecture me, you know.\" He\r\nwas startled. \"Good Heavens!\" he thought, \"am I a prig?\"\r\n\r\nAddie laughed: \"Well, I am trusting to you to understand _me_, at any rate.\r\nJust like Oliver!\" she went on. \"He came once, years ago, to stay with old\r\nMiss Hayward, who left us the house, and he knew something then of the man\r\nat this cottage; so he tells me to meet him there, without ever thinking\r\nhow I should get to the place by myself at nine at night. Hush! what's\r\nthat?--Oh, Noll! Noll!\"\r\n\r\nA man's voice was heard at a little distance singing, and she darted\r\nforward, her eyes alight with joy. Percival followed, slackening his pace\r\nand listening to Mr. Oliver Blake's rendering of \"Champagne Charlie is my\r\nname.\" It ceased abruptly. He doubted what to do, took a step or two\r\nmechanically, and came suddenly out on the open space at the farther side\r\nof the wood, where was the cottage in question. Addie had run forward and\r\nforgotten him. He strolled with elaborate unconsciousness to some palings\r\nnear by, turning his back on Addie and her brother, rested his folded arms\r\nthere and gazed at the placid landscape. Below ran the little stream by\r\nwhich he had loitered in the morning, hurrying now in a straighter course,\r\nlike an idle messenger who finds that time has fled much faster than he\r\nthought. The river-mist hung white above the level meadows, and it seemed\r\nto Percival as if Nature, falling asleep, had glided into a pallid and\r\nmelancholy dream. The last gleams of day were blending with a misty flood\r\nof moonlight, beneath which the world lay dwarfed and dark. On the horizon\r\na little black windmill with motionless sails stood high against the sky,\r\nlooking like a toy, as if a child had set it there and gone to bed.\r\n\r\nTo Percival, as he stood, came the sound, though not the words, of a rapid\r\nflow of talk, broken by a short, often-recurring laugh. But at last there\r\nwas a pause, and the two came toward him. He turned to meet them, and saw\r\nin the moonlight that Oliver Blake was big and broad-shouldered, with black\r\nhair, curling thickly under a jaunty cap, and bright restless eyes. Addie\r\nhad her arm drawn fondly through her brother's.\r\n\r\n\"Oliver,\" she said, \"this is Percival: you have heard me speak of him.\"\r\n\r\nOliver bent his head in a blunt, constrained way and looked doubtfully at\r\nthe other. Percival, who was going to extend his hand, withheld it, and\r\nmade a stately little bow in return.\r\n\r\n\"That's very magnificent,\" said Addie to him.--\"Why, Noll,\" she laughed,\r\n\"you needn't be so cautious. Percival knows. He is to be trusted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Oliver. \"What does that feel like, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"What does what feel like?\" said Thorne as they shook hands. \"Being\r\ntrusted, do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay. Being trusted or being to be trusted. I don't know either sensation\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not likely, dear boy,\" said Addie, \"with your way of going on. And yet Mr.\r\nOsborne must have trusted you, or how did you get the money and get away?\r\nYou weren't to have any till you sailed, were you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to know?\" said Oliver, his dark eyes twinkling. \"I tried to\r\npersuade him--no good. Then I told him a--don't be horrified--it was a very\r\nfine specimen of fiction--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oliver!\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is no doubt set down to the governor's account.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he believe you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he didn't know what to do. I don't think he would have, only if it\r\nwasn't true it was so stupendous, you see. He hesitated, and that made him\r\nrelax his watchfulness a little. So I gave him the slip and pawned part of\r\nmy outfit, which we bought together the day before.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bad boy!\"\r\n\r\n\"I left him a bit of a note. I told him that if he held his tongue I would\r\nsurely be there again to-morrow, we'd get the things, and no one would be\r\nany the wiser. But if he made a row he might whistle for me, and catch me\r\nif he could.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you don't know the effect of that, I suppose?\" said Percival.\r\n\r\n\"Well, no. I read it over when I'd done to try and judge it impartially.\r\nAnd I made up my mind--considering the character he'd had of me--that if I\r\nwere Osborne I should say that Blake meant to back out of his bargain with\r\nall he could lay his hands on, and was trying to secure two days'\r\nstart.--What do you think I did, Addie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something silly, I've no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, looking at her with an admiring gaze, which partly\r\nexplained to Percival the secret of her fondness for her brother, \"_I_\r\nthought it was rather clever. I just popped in the letter I had from you,\r\nand your photograph, and if that doesn't convince him, I give him up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Noll! How _could_ you? What is he like?\"\r\n\r\nBlake burst out laughing: \"Listen to her! A man has got her photograph: he\r\ninstantly becomes an interesting object.--Oh, he isn't a bad-looking\r\nfellow, Addie. I dare say he's glaring at you now through his spectacles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spectacles! Oliver, you've no business to go giving my photograph to all\r\nsorts of people. And I hate him too, because if it hadn't been for him\r\nperhaps you wouldn't have been going away to Canada.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\" said he philosophically. \"Your mother would have had a dear\r\nfriend on the point of starting for the Cannibal Islands.\"\r\n\r\nPercival began to feel a little anxious about time, and to wonder when the\r\nreal leave-taking was to commence. He looked at his watch after the manner\r\nof a stage-aside, and Addie took the hint.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later she came toward him with bent head and averted eyes:\r\n\"I'm ready, Percival.\" But they had not gone a dozen steps when she sobbed,\r\n\"Oh, my poor Noll!\" and rushed back. As young Thorne looked after her he\r\nheard the quick spurt of a match. Oliver had turned on his heel already and\r\nwas lighting his cigar. \"Heartless brute!\" said Percival.\r\n\r\nThe verdict was unjust. Oliver had taken infinite pains to secure this\r\nglimpse of his sister, but since it was over it _was_ over. He loved her,\r\nand she knew it, but he was not the man to stand sentimentally staring at\r\nAddie's back as she disappeared into the shadows of Langley Wood. Now,\r\nPercival could not have failed in such a matter, though he might have\r\nthought no more about it than did Oliver Blake.\r\n\r\nWhen he and Addie were once more on their way he occupied himself solely\r\nwith the slight difficulties of her path, but before they had gone halfway\r\nshe was making an effort to talk in her usual style, and succeeding fairly\r\nwell. They were just at the place where the paths branched off, and\r\nPercival was stooping to disentangle her dress, which was caught on a\r\nbramble. As he raised himself he heard an approaching step, and quick as\r\nthought he laid his hand on Addie's arm. A couple of yards farther and they\r\nwould be in the one path, and must meet the newcomer. Standing where they\r\nwere, it was an even chance: he might pass them or might go the other way.\r\nAddie stood breathless, and Percival's heart gave a quick throb, more for\r\nAddie's sake than his own. But, after all, it might be no one who knew\r\nthem, and in that dim light--\r\n\r\nThe moon glided with startling swiftness from behind a fleecy cloud and\r\nshone on their white faces. The man, passing close by, started and stepped\r\nback, recovered himself with a muttered ejaculation, and said, \"Fine\r\nevening, Mr. Thorne,\" as he passed.\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" Percival replied. \"Good-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe other returned a \"Good-night, sir,\" and disappeared in the twilight.\r\n\r\n\"He knew you,\" said Addie. She looked frightened. Her parting from Oliver\r\nhad unnerved her: difficulties which she had made light of in the happiness\r\nof anticipation seemed more formidable now. Standing there in the white\r\nmoonlight and dim shadows of the wood, she suddenly realized the strange\r\nand doubtful aspect her expedition with Percival Thorne must wear to\r\nordinary eyes. Nor was her companion likely to reassure her. An air of\r\nsombre resolution was more in his line than the light-hearted confidence\r\nwhich would have treated the whole affair as a trifle. He was, as Addie\r\nherself had called him, \"well behaved.\" She would have trusted him to the\r\ndeath, only just at that moment a little touch of happy recklessness would\r\nhave been a greater comfort to her than his anxious loyalty. But Percival\r\ncould never be reckless: deliberately indifferent he might be, but reckless\r\nnever.\r\n\r\n\"He knew you,\" said Addie, as they resumed their walk.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but he would not know you. It does not signify much,\" was Percival's\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\"But he does know me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! Oh, you mean he knows your name.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded: \"He often passes our house. Always on Thursday, when a lot of\r\npeople go by. Isn't it a market somewhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brookley market. Oh yes, he would go there, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once or twice I have been walking on the road, and he has driven past. I\r\nknow his face quite well, and I'm sure--I should think--he knows mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely he may not have recognized you in this half-light,\" said\r\nPercival.\r\n\r\nShe shivered: \"He did. I felt him look right through me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, suppose he did. After all, there is no reason why we should not take\r\na walk together on a summer evening if we like, is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he going?\" said Addie. \"To the cottage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear, no! There are endless paths in the wood. He will turn off still\r\nmore to the right: he cuts off a corner so going from Fordborough to his\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who and what is he?\" was Miss Blake's next question as they emerged into\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n\"Silas Fielding. He farms a little bit of old Garnett's land, and I rather\r\nthink he rents an outlying field or two of my grandfather's. A horsey sort\r\nof fellow. I am not particularly fond of Mr. Silas Fielding,\" said\r\nPercival, and they walked a little way in silence.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't come any farther,\" said Addie. \"Percival, I don't know how to\r\nthank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do it, then. I see no occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I see occasion--very great occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will consider it done,\" said Percival.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wardlaw's house was very near. \"I'm not late, am I?\" said Addie.\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch: \"A little more than a quarter to ten--very good\r\ntime. I shall watch you along this last little bit of road, and see you let\r\nin. Good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night.\" She went quickly away, and he waited as he had promised. She\r\nlooked back at him once, and saw him stand, dark and motionless like a\r\nbronze statue. She reached the garden-gate, and just as a farmer's gig,\r\nwith one man in it, dashed past, she ran up the little flight of steps,\r\nknocked, and was instantly admitted, as if Mrs. Wardlaw stood inside with\r\nher hand on the latch. Percival, seeing this, turned to begin his homeward\r\nwalk, but as the gig rattled up to him its speed was slackened.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Thorne! Isn't it Mr. Percival Thorne?\"\r\n\r\nIt was the young artist driving back to the farm in Mr. Collins's old gig,\r\nand inducing Mr. Collins's old horse to go at a headlong pace. \"I thought\r\nit was you standing in the moonlight,\" he said. \"Can't I give you a lift?\"\r\n\r\nPercival accepted, and they started off, if possible more vehemently than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"I must look sharp,\" explained the young man whose name was Alf, \"or I\r\nshall be late at the farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have only just come from Fordborough?\" said Percival.\r\n\r\n\"No. I put up the horse and stayed later than I meant. I'd no idea that\r\ndull little hole of a town could wake up so. Why, it is flapping with flags\r\nfrom one end to the other. I never saw such a lot of tramps and drunken men\r\nin my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Charming idea you have of waking up!\"\r\n\r\n\"And brass bands and gypsies,\" the other went on. \"When I wanted to come\r\naway the hostler was drunk and couldn't find the horse, and I couldn't find\r\nthe gig; that is, I could find a score all exactly like this one, but as to\r\nknowing which of all the gigs in the yard belonged to old Collins, I\r\ncouldn't have told to save my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"You got it at last, I suppose?\" said Thorne.\r\n\r\nThe other was cautious: \"Well, I got _this_. The man put the horse in\r\nsomehow, and then he was so far gone he began to talk to himself and undo\r\nthe harness again. I believe he thought he'd put in a pair by mistake, and\r\nwas trying to take one out. However, I stopped that, and got away after a\r\nfashion.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are early birds at the farm, no doubt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Early? Rather! At half-past nine old Collins creaks up stairs, and Mrs.\r\nCollins goes into the kitchen and rakes out the cinders for fear of fire. I\r\nwas out late one night last week, and she couldn't wake the old man up to\r\nlet me in. It was twenty minutes to eleven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she come herself?\" said Percival. \"I know Mrs. Collins by daylight,\r\nbut I can't imagine Mrs. Collins aroused from her first sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Where ignorance is bliss.' The dear old lady kept me on the doorstep for\r\nten minutes or so while she was trying to make up her mind whether she\r\nwould keep her nightcap on, or whether she would take it off and put on\r\nthe light-brown front she ordinarily wears. At last she made up her mind to\r\nretain the nightcap and add the front by way of a finish. But I have it on\r\nher own authority that she was flurried and all of a shake, so she didn't\r\ncarry out her idea skilfully. The cap was half off and the front was only\r\nhalf on. I saw her forehead getting lower and lower as she spoke to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could she ever forgive you for seeing her so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. I'm rather a favorite, I think. She beamed on me just the same the\r\nnext morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"She did?\" said Thorne. \"A wonderful woman!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I shall ask her for a lock of her chestnut hair to-morrow before I\r\ngo, to show that my faith in it is--well, as implicit as ever. Ah! by the\r\nway, I got my letter. I thought most likely I should. I leave the first\r\nthing in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to hear it,\" said Percival. But it occurred to him that the artist's\r\ndeparture would prevent any talk the next day of the circumstances of their\r\nmeeting that evening. He jumped down, with hasty thanks to his new friend\r\nwhen they came to the little gate. \"You'll be in a ditch if you don't look\r\nout,\" he called after him.\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" was shouted back, and old Collins's gig vanished into the\r\nouter darkness with the young artist, whom Percival Thorne has never\r\nchanced to meet again to this day.\r\n\r\nHe let himself in with his key and hurried up to the house. The door which\r\nopened on the terrace was unfastened as usual. The lights were burning in\r\nthe drawing-room, but no one was there, and the bright vacant room had a\r\nstrange ghostly aspect, a little island of mellow radiance in the vast\r\nsilence and darkness of the night. He felt like one in a dream, and stood\r\nidly thinking of the young painter rattling in old Collins's gig to Willow\r\nFarm; of Silas Fielding striding across the meadows with thoughts intent on\r\nhis bargains; of Oliver Blake turning in with a yawn when his cigar was\r\ndone; of Addie forcing back her unshed tears and hiding deep in her heart\r\nthe well-spring of her tenderness for her poor Noll. He had not done\r\njustice to Addie Blake. Something of the feeling of underlying beauty,\r\nunsought or ignored, which he gained from his artist-friend's talk in the\r\nmorning, had come to him in a slightly altered form with Addie that\r\nevening. With Alf it was the every-day world which revealed new\r\nbeauty--with Addie it was shown in what Percival had taken for a prosaic\r\nand commonplace character. He found himself wondering whether he might not\r\nhave failed to do justice to others besides Addie. He had looked far away\r\nfor his ideal, and had found a fair faint dream, when it might be that the\r\nreality was close at hand. Since the wayside had blossomed with unexpected\r\nloveliness, what grace and charm and hidden treasure might be his prize who\r\nshould win his way into the fenced garden of Sissy's sweet soul!\r\n\r\nHe started from his reverie, and was surprised to find that it had lasted\r\nonly two or three minutes: it seemed to him as if he had been dreaming a\r\nlong while in that bright loneliness. He walked to the window, with \"Where\r\ncan they all be?\" on his lips. And for an answer to his question, standing\r\nat the far end of the terrace was Sissy. As he hurried through the hall to\r\njoin her the library-door opened an inch or two and a voice inquired, \"Who\r\nis that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is I--Percival,\" he answered in haste.\r\n\r\nAt the word \"Percival\" the door opened wider, and Mr. Thorne looked out:\r\n\"Oh! where is Sissy?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the terrace.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Horace?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" still chafing to be gone.\r\n\r\n\"Sissy ought to come in. It's a quarter-past ten.\" He looked up at the\r\ngreat hall-clock. \"Yes, a quarter-past ten, and she will be catching cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you come in for a shawl for her? Take her one--anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will;\" and Percival made a dash at the row of pegs and caught down the\r\nfirst thing which looked moderately like a cloak. Then he escaped.\r\n\r\nSissy was coming to the house, but so leisurely that the journey was likely\r\nto take her a considerable time. \"At last!\" she said as he came up to her:\r\n\"Why, which way--Oh, it's _you_, Percival!\"\r\n\r\n\"You thought I was Horace?\" he said as he put the cloak round her.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for the moment I did. What are you muffling me up like this for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Orders,\" said Percival. \"My grandfather said you were to come in, and that\r\nI was to bring you a shawl.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the good of this thing if I'm to go in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very sensibly put. Evidently no good at all. So we will turn round and go\r\nto the end of the terrace and back, unless you are tired.\"\r\n\r\nShe was not tired.\r\n\r\n\"And you took me for Horace? I always said we were alike.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not a bit alike.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, of course not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be absurd,\" said Sissy. \"Anybody's like anybody if it's pitch dark\r\nand they don't speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rather suspect Horace and I might be alike if it were a half-light, and\r\nif we _did_ speak,\" said Percival. \"Remember the photograph. But where is\r\nHorace all this time? What have you been doing with yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's somewhere about,\" said Sissy. \"First of all, we had a little croquet.\r\nThen it got too dark to play, so I went to see after Aunt Harriet. Her head\r\nwas worse; so she said she would go to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor old lady! Best thing she could do. She'll be better to-morrow, I\r\nhope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then Horace and I thought we would go and look up his old nurse. She has\r\nbeen teasing me ever so long, wanting to see 'Master Horace,' and it's only\r\nacross a couple of fields. But she wasn't at home, and the cottage was shut\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone to Fordborough for the day, most likely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say. She has a niece there. Then we came back, and Horace didn't\r\nmuch want to go in, because of this afternoon, you know; so we stayed in\r\nthe long walk, and he smoked and we listened to the nightingales.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very delightful,\" said Percival. \"The long walk and the nightingales, I\r\nmean.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then there was a little pinkish light in the sky, and he thought there\r\nwas a fire somewhere. So he went into the park to get a better view, and\r\nafter I had waited for him a little while I came up here and met you.\"\r\n\r\nA quick step was heard on the gravel behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, here you are!\" said Horace. \"The fire doesn't seem to be anything,\r\nSissy, after all. The light got fainter and fainter, and it's all gone\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you think it was?\" Percival inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I thought from the direction that it must be at old Garnett's Upland\r\nFarm, but it can't have been much. So you have got back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Hadn't we better go in? You must mind what you are about, Horace,\r\nthough it _is_ warm. That cough of yours--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stuff and nonsense about my cough!\" But he turned to go in nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" said Percival, as he walked between them, \"you've been out\r\nall the evening: does any one know I've been away?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Sissy. \"Why, don't you want--\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather they didn't,\" he replied. (The stars in their courses\r\nseemed to fight for Addie and her secret, had it not been for that untoward\r\nmeeting with Silas Fielding.)\r\n\r\nHorace wore a knowing expression. He was rather pleased that his lecturer\r\nshould be compelled to seek a pledge of secrecy from him. It made him feel\r\nmore on a level with the well-conducted and independent Percival. \"All\r\nright!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You may trust me,\" in a softly earnest voice on the other side.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you both,\" said Percival, but his eyes thanked Sissy.\r\n\r\n\"What have you been after?\" asked Horace. \"I thought most likely you were\r\noff to the friend you met this morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe astonishing way in which circumstances conspired to aid in guarding the\r\nmystery! \"I have been with him,\" said Percival.\r\n\r\n(We value the opinion of others too much very often for our own peace.\r\nQueer, unsubstantial things those opinions often are. \"I have been with\r\nhim.\" Sissy felt a little glow of kindliness toward the unknown: it might\r\nhave been, \"I have been with her.\" She was prejudiced in his favor, and\r\nsure that he was a nice fellow. Horace was ready to stake something on his\r\nconviction that he was a bad lot, this fellow Percy had picked up, and that\r\nPercy knew it.)\r\n\r\nPercy was still warm with the chivalrous devotion which had been kindled in\r\nhim that evening. It was reserved for the colder morning light to reveal to\r\nhim that what with Lottie on the hillside and Addie in Langley Wood he was\r\nplunging into little adventures which were hardly consistent with the\r\ncharacter of a most prudent young man. Yet such was the character he was\r\nsupposed to have undertaken to support in the world's drama.\r\n\r\nThey reached the door, and Horace went in, but Sissy lingered yet a moment\r\non the threshold. \"Isn't it all beautiful?\" she said, taking one more look:\r\n\"if it could only last!\"\r\n\r\nPercival smiled: \"Sissy, have _you_ learnt that?\"\r\n\r\n\"November--bare boughs and bitter winds--I hate to think of it,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I would say, 'Don't think of it,' but it would be no good,\" he replied.\r\n\"When the thought of change has once occurred to you while you look at a\r\nlandscape, it is a part of every landscape thenceforward. But it gives a\r\nbitter charm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spring will come again,\" she said; \"but death and parting and loss--they\r\nare so dreadful! And growing old! Oh, Percival, why must they all be?\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders: \"The whole world echoes your 'Why?' Sissy, I\r\nwish I could help you, but I can't. I can only tell you that I understand\r\nwhat you feel. It is very terrible looking forward to age--to loss of\r\npowers, hopes and friends. One feels sometimes as if one could not tread\r\nthat long gray road to the grave.\"\r\n\r\nSissy shivered, as if she saw it drawn out before her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"But after all it may be brighter than we think,\" he went on after a pause.\r\n\"There is joy and beauty in change, as well as bitterness. If everything in\r\nthe world were fixed and unalterable, would not that be far more terrible?\r\nAs it is, we have all the possibilities on our side. Who knows what\r\ngladness may grow out of endless change?\" Yet even as he spoke he was\r\nconscious of a wild, impotent longing to snatch her--she was so delicate\r\nand sweet--from beneath the great revolving wheels of time, with a cry of\r\n\r\n    Stay as you are, and be loved for ever.\r\n\r\nBut the poet's very words carry the sentence of doom in the memory that the\r\nblossom to which they were uttered must have perished years ago.\r\n\r\n\"Sissy,\" he said suddenly, \"surely there cannot be much suffering reserved\r\nfor you. Oh, poor child! I wish I could take it all in your place.\" He\r\nspoke in all earnestness, yet could he have looked into the future he would\r\nhave seen that her suffering would not be long, but very keen, and his not\r\nto bear, but to inflict.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMEANWHILE.\r\n\r\nPercival Thorne had never thought much on the subject of revenge. He rather\r\ntook it for granted that deliberate revenge was an extraordinary and\r\naltogether exceptional thing. People give way to bursts of passion which\r\npass away and leave no trace: they are so hot with fury which comes to\r\nnothing at all that at the first glance it seems as if the anger which\r\nbears fruit must be something different in kind. But it is possible that if\r\nPercival had considered the matter he might have arrived at the conclusion\r\nthat revenge does not depend only on intensity of passion, but on intensity\r\nof passion and aptness of opportunity together. Disembodied hate soon dies\r\nunless it is fiendish in its strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"ADDIE STOOD BREATHLESS, AND PERCIVAL'S HEART GAVE A QUICK\r\nTHROB.\"--Page 676.]\r\n\r\nHe had had fair warning at the birthday party. Lottie, smarting with\r\nhumiliation, had looked him full in the face with a flash of such bitter\r\nenmity as springs from the consciousness of one's own folly. And Lottie's\r\neyes conveyed their meaning well. That very afternoon, when Percival\r\nlooked up as he lay on the turf at her feet, they had been most eloquent of\r\nlove. \"Foolish child!\" he had thought, \"she is only seventeen to-day, and\r\nchildish still.\" When he encountered the sudden flash of hate he would\r\nhardly have been surprised at some instant manifestation of it. Had she\r\ncarried a dagger, like\r\n\r\n    Our Lombard country-girls along the coast,\r\n\r\nvengeance might have come at once. But she spoke to him later in her\r\nordinary voice, and touched his hand when she bade him good-night; and it\r\nwas only natural to conclude that nothing would follow her glance of fury.\r\nSomething of bitterness might linger for a while, but Lottie was only\r\nseventeen, and that afternoon she had loved him.\r\n\r\nHe was right enough. There was nothing fiendish in Lottie's hatred: it\r\nwould soon have spent its strength in helpless longings and died. But that\r\nvery night it flew straight to Horace Thorne, and unobserved found shelter\r\nthere. It assumed a shape not clearly defined as yet, but a shape which\r\ntime would surely reveal. It drew Lottie to the young man's side while the\r\ntears of pain and shame were hardly yet dry upon her burning cheeks.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the talk on her birthday morning, Lottie hardly understood the\r\nrelative positions of the Thornes. Percival was disinherited and Horace was\r\nthe heir. Naturally, she supposed that Horace was the favorite, and that\r\nthe old man was displeased with Percival. She concluded that the small\r\nincome of which the latter had spoken was probably a grudging allowance\r\nfrom Mr. Thorne. His grandfather protected and patronized him now, and no\r\ndoubt it would be in Horace's power to protect and patronize him hereafter.\r\nLottie hardly knew what she dreamed or wished, but she felt that she should\r\nindeed be avenged if the dole might in any way be regulated by her caprice,\r\ngiven or withheld according to the mood of the moment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Percival drifted contentedly on, unconscious that Lottie had\r\nvowed vengeance and Sissy devotion. Mr. Thorne went about with an air of\r\nfurtive triumph, as if he were tasting the sweetness of having outwitted\r\nsomebody. Horace divided his time between divers pleasures, but contrived\r\nto run down to Fordborough once just before he went yachting with a friend.\r\nHe took to letter-writing with praiseworthy regularity, and yet his\r\naccustomed correspondents were curiously unaware of his sudden energy. He\r\ntoo had his look of triumph sometimes, but it was uneasy triumph, as if he\r\nwere not absolutely certain that some one might not have outwitted him.\r\nOliver Blake on board the good ship Curlew had passed the period of\r\nsea-sickness, and was flirting desperately with a lively fellow-passenger,\r\nwhile Addie followed him with anxious thoughts. About this time his father\r\nwent in secret to consult a London doctor, and came away with a grave face\r\nand a tender softening of his heart toward his only son. A visit to his\r\nlawyer ensued, and of this also Mrs. Blake knew nothing. The girls played\r\ncroquet as before, Lottie won the ivory mallet on the great field-day of\r\nthe Fordborough club, and Mrs. Rawlinson and Miss Lloyd hated her with\r\ntheir sweetest smiles. Week after week of glorious weather went by.\r\nBrackenhill lay stretched in the sleepy golden sunshine, and the leaves in\r\nLangley Wood, quivering against the unclouded blue, had lost the freshness\r\nof the early summer. The shadows and the sadness were to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n              Well, what's gone from me?\r\n    What have I lost in you?--R. BROWNING.\r\n\r\nPercival awoke one day to the consciousness that the world was smaller,\r\ngrayer and flatter than he had supposed it. At the same moment he became\r\naware that a burden was lifted from his shoulders and that a disturbing\r\nelement was gone out of his life.\r\n\r\nThis is how the change in the universe was effected. Percival met Godfrey\r\nHammond, and they talked of indifferent things. As they were parting\r\nHammond looked over his shoulder and came back: \"I knew there was something\r\nI wanted to ask you. Have you heard that the young lady with the latent\r\nnobility in her face is going to be married?\"\r\n\r\n\"What young lady?\" said Percival stiffly. He knew perfectly well, and\r\nHammond knew that he knew.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lisle.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I hadn't heard. Who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"The happy man? Lord Scarbrook's eldest son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are incredulous, but I fear I can't soften the blow. The man who told\r\nme heard Lisle talking about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no blow to soften,\" said Percival, \"I assure you I don't feel it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Hammond, \"there was once a man who didn't know that his head had\r\nbeen cut off till he sneezed--wasn't there? Take great care of yourself,\r\nPercival.\" And nodding a second farewell Godfrey left him, and Percival\r\nwent on his way through that curiously shrunken world.\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, the blow was premature. Mr. Lisle had only talked of a\r\nprobability which he earnestly hoped would be realized.\r\n\r\nBut Percival did not doubt it. He tried to analyze his feelings as he\r\nwalked away. He had known but little of Judith Lisle, but when first he saw\r\nher face he felt that the vague dream which till then had approached, only\r\nto elude him, in clouds, in fire, in poems, in flowers, in music, had taken\r\nhuman shape and looked at him out of her gray eyes. Percival had no certain\r\nassurance that she _was_ his ideal, but from that time forward he pictured\r\nhis ideal in her guise.\r\n\r\nHe did not dream of winning her. Mr. Lisle had boasted to him one evening,\r\nas they sat over their wine, of all that he meant to do for his daughter,\r\nand of the great match he hoped she would make. Percival had a feeling of\r\npeculiar loyalty to Mr. Lisle as the friend whom his dead father had\r\ntrusted most of all. He could not think of Judith, for he could never be a\r\nfit husband for her in Mr. Lisle's eyes. Had he been heir to\r\nBrackenhill--But he was not.\r\n\r\nSo he acquiesced, patiently enough. He did not attempt to do anything. What\r\nwas there to do? By the time that he had struggled through the crowd and\r\ngot his foot on the first round of that ladder which _may_ lead to fortune,\r\nJudith would probably be married. He did not even know certainly that she\r\nwas the woman he wanted to win. Why should he force the lazy stream of his\r\nexistence into a rough and stony channel that he might have a\r\nchance--infinitesimally small--of winning her.\r\n\r\nYet there were moments of exaltation when it seemed to him as if his\r\nacquiescence were tame and mean--as if his life would miss its crown unless\r\nhe could attain to his ideal. At such moments he felt the stings of shame\r\nand ambition. Yet what could he do? The mood passed, and left him drifting\r\nonward as before.\r\n\r\nBut now all thought of Judith Lisle was over. Even if she were in truth his\r\nideal woman, it was certain that she was no longer within his reach. That\r\nhaunting possibility was gone. All that it had ever done for him was to\r\nmake him dissatisfied with himself from time to time, and yet he found\r\nhimself regretting it.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURED BY COSSACKS.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM LETTERS OF A FRENCH OFFICER IN 1813.[B]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COSSACKS AND FRENCH PRISONERS.]\r\n\r\nWISMAR, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, March 8, 1813.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PARENTS: I regret to announce that recent public events have sadly\r\ndisturbed the relatively comfortable circumstances which favored my\r\nconvalescence. Since the 26th ult. our lines have been drawn in, and I have\r\naccompanied my detachment to this place, where the expected arrival of\r\nGeneral Morand from Pomerania will probably be the signal of a hasty\r\nretreat. The lamentable fate of our grand army in barbarous Russia is now\r\ncasting its shadows upon us. It is because so many of our friends remained\r\n_there_ that we shall have to move from _here_. Possibly, a speedy return\r\nto the home I left nine years ago may afford some compensation for this\r\ninglorious retreat. The cities of Hamburg and Lubeck are in open revolt and\r\nill-treating and driving away the French authorities. If only we had once\r\nthe Elbe in our rear! The Cossacks are not far off, and the whole country\r\nis awaiting them with open arms. Adieu for to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWISMAR, 13th March, 1813.\r\n\r\nGeneral Morand and his command arrived here at noon to-day. My brothers,\r\nFrank and Louis, are with him and in the best of health. Our trio held a\r\ncouncil of war an hour ago, and unanimously resolved to remain at the post\r\nof honor whatever may betide. I reported in person to the general, who,\r\nafter viewing my scar from the Hamburg bullet, assured me that my name\r\nwould appear on the next recommendation for promotions. All the members of\r\nour brigade who had been on coast-guard duty in Mecklenburg are being\r\nreorganized into a special battalion, in which I retain the rank of first\r\nlieutenant. Frank holds a sergeant's commission, while little Louis remains\r\na private fusilier. An order of the day announces that furloughs are out of\r\nthe question, and that deserters will be dealt with as every one knows how.\r\nThe latter bit of information is for the special benefit of our Saxon\r\nallies, of whom our command embraces twelve hundred. The remainder of it\r\nconsists of three hundred artillery-men, four hundred marines, two hundred\r\nand fifty coast-guards and a squad of civil and military functionaries--all\r\nFrench and well armed and equipped. To-morrow the homeward march begins.\r\n\r\n\r\nACROSS THE ELBE! WINSEN-ON-THE-LUCKE, 18th March.\r\n\r\nAs the enemy is close upon our heels, we left Wismar in double-quick time.\r\nOn the 16th, on leaving Moellen, Frank and I visited the grave of the\r\nfamous German jester Eulenspiegel, but did not take time to drive memorial\r\nnails into the surrounding trees, as thousands of pilgrims had done before\r\nus.\r\n\r\nNot far from there we suddenly came upon a band of Cossacks resting their\r\njaded nags in a marshy meadow. It was something of a mutual surprise. A\r\nsingle glance down our line convinced the hostile commander that we could\r\nnot consistently give him time to get away. Hence, waving a white streamer\r\nat the butt end of a lance, he rode forward and called in passable German\r\nfor a _parlementaire_. My anxiety to learn all about this new and singular\r\nrace of people induced me to request this appointment, which was promptly\r\ngranted by the commander of our van. No diplomatic chicaneries hampered my\r\nmission, which was accomplished in a very few minutes. The result was an\r\nunconditional surrender. The poor fellows were the victims of an excess of\r\nzeal, having ridden ahead of us while they imagined themselves on our\r\nflank. The terms of our future relations being mutually agreed upon, the\r\ncommander, who had acquired his German in the Prussian service, and was no\r\nstranger to Virgil and Horace, offered me a hearty shake of his right hand,\r\nwhile the other, deftly unbuckling a holster, drew forth a sample of\r\ngenuine Mecklenburger Kuemmel schnapps, which proved not unworthy of\r\ncementing a treaty of peace. While the prisoners were being marshalled into\r\ncustody I had ample opportunity to scan the fifty specimens of exotic\r\nhumanity before me, but utterly failed to discover in their outward\r\nfeatures the proverbial elements of popular terror. Though generally nimble\r\nand well-proportioned, they were scarcely above the average French\r\nvoltigeur in stature, and a bullet or rapier would find the way through\r\ntheir untanned sheepskin jackets just as easily as through any more\r\ncivilized uniform. Apart from their lances, which they are said to handle\r\nwith dangerous skill, these scouts carry no weapons worth mentioning. Their\r\nrusty horse-pistols are almost harmless toys. A more uncouth-looking\r\nsoldier than a Cossack on foot can hardly be imagined. Perhaps it is not\r\nfair to judge them in this abnormal predicament. When they were informed\r\nthat they would be treated just like ordinary prisoners, a grin of\r\nsatisfaction lighted up their countenances with an expression of droll\r\nhumor not suspected before. In the pockets of their cloaks\r\nand _portemanteaux_ were found an amount and variety of pelf somewhat\r\ndifficult to account for in the possession of warriors who had not yet\r\nreached the enemy's country. Among the rest I will only mention gold,\r\nsilver and copper coins, medals, breastpins, ear- and finger-rings, watches\r\nand chains, seals, meerschaum pipes, snuff-boxes, brass buttons, beads,\r\ntea-spoons, feminine miniatures, locks of flaxen hair of the same sex, and,\r\nlast and strangest, bottles of Jean Marie Farina's veritable eau de\r\nCologne! It may be charitably assumed that the latter three suggestive\r\narticles were the heart's gifts of patriotic North German maidens to their\r\nlong-prayed-for liberators. _Honni soit qui mal y pense._ But it is hardly\r\nprobable that the original possessors of the more intrinsic valuables had\r\nparted with them from equally sentimental motives. Hence our lads wisely\r\ndiscriminated in their disposition of the captured treasures, the coins,\r\njewelry, tea-spoons and meerschaums being temporarily confiscated \"until\r\nthe proper owners could be found.\" _A la guerre comme a la guerre._\r\n\r\nIn the night of the 16th-17th we reached Bergdorff, where we halted until\r\nnext afternoon. Just before dusk, at the crossing of a stream, we (the van)\r\nwere attacked by a partisan column, who relieved us of a dozen prisoners,\r\nand in exchange left a few dead upon the field. We are looking for more of\r\nthis sort of warfare until strongly reinforced. We have to contend not only\r\nwith the Russians and Prussians, but with all the people on our way, who\r\nhave raised their hands against the French. Evidently, we have made few\r\nfriends in this country, which--_entre nous_--to an unbiassed mind does not\r\nseem at all strange. Somehow, even when not personally molested, we are\r\ncontinually losing baggage. I carry only my most indispensable effects on\r\nmy horse. My large trunk, though far behind me now, is in trusty hands,\r\nwith your address in case anything serious should befall its owner. Frank's\r\nbaggage is on the general train, while Louis carries all his worldly\r\npossessions in his knapsack, which begins to act as a powerful sudorific\r\nupon the dear little fellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREMEN, 24th March.\r\n\r\nThis city has not yet risen in open rebellion, though the faces here are\r\nsullen enough. General Carra St. Cyr, with two battalions of cohortes and\r\nfifteen hundred coast-guards, has succeeded so far in keeping down the\r\npopular temper. But Bremerloe, six leagues from here, is occupied by a\r\nformidable band of armed rebels, and at this very moment a detachment is\r\nbeing sent out to attend to them. Among the young recruits of St. Cyr's\r\ncommand I found quite a number of Alsatians, some from my own birthplace,\r\nSaverne. They are all in the highest of spirits and eager to go ahead.\r\nConsidering the sacrifice of precious lives our country has made within the\r\nlast twenty years, the enthusiasm of these boys is truly wonderful.\r\n\r\n\r\n25th March.\r\n\r\nBremerloe was captured and the enemy routed. None of your sons were at the\r\nfray, but while I write my horse is being saddled and all is getting ready\r\nfor a return march toward the Elbe. Has a victory improved the situation in\r\nour rear, or do some of our retreating brethren need our support? We do not\r\nknow. The order is to march.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUeNEBURG, Braunschweig, 1st April, 10 P. M.\r\n\r\nSince our departure from Bremen no bed but the open field or the barest\r\nfloor has rested my limbs until this evening, when, for the first time in a\r\nweek, I enjoyed the luxury of a change of clothes. How sweet it is to rest\r\nafter a hard day's work! This town, surrounded by an old-style ditch and\r\nwall, was even this forenoon in possession of the enemy. About eighty\r\nCossacks, eight hundred German recruits and the whole male population,\r\narmed with muskets, spears and pitch-forks, defended the place for two\r\nhours. But as we had sixteen field-guns, and they none fit for use, we\r\ndefeated them with inconsiderable loss. The greater part of the civilians,\r\nfearing severe punishment, fled with the Cossacks. Our gunners poured in\r\nthe shot and grape until there is scarcely a whole window in the western\r\nhalf of the town. Two of our companies headed the Saxons in the assault\r\nover the wall, while the rest pressed in through the battered-down gates.\r\nLouis was in the lead, and landed inside without a scratch. Having lost his\r\nknapsack in a skirmish on the road, he had no surplus weight to carry.\r\nFrank was close behind me in the rush through the Bardowicker gate. Though\r\nthis day may never be honored with a line in the annals of the great\r\nNapoleonic wars, it was quite as hot for a while as any other of greater\r\nfame for those immediately concerned. The street-scenes were ghastly, and\r\nforcibly reminded me of certain others of saddest memory, when, a boy of\r\nonly nine years of age, I followed you, my dear parents, over the dead and\r\nmangled bodies of citizens and soldiers out of the town of Saverne,\r\ndisgraced and blood-stained by a revolutionary mob. With this difference,\r\nhowever, that here the dead and wounded were our inveterate foes, while\r\nthere they wore the features of our most cherished friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DON COSSACKS AND BASHKIRS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIN A VILLAGE NEAR BOITZENBURG, 4th April.\r\n\r\nHow quickly the leaf has turned! At the date of my last we were victors:\r\nto-day we are not only vanquished, but prisoners.\r\n\r\nDo not be alarmed, however, dearest parents. All three of your sons are\r\nalive and well, even relatively comfortable. No complaint even from poor\r\nLouis, who was caught by the Cossacks, robbed of his coat and purse, then\r\nturned over to the citizens, who, after unspeakable insults and brutal\r\ntreatment, stripped him of everything but his shirt and drawers. My own\r\nstory is too complex to be related to-day. I will only state in brief what\r\nyou may have already divined--that on the day following the capture of\r\nLueneburg we were surprised in and around the town by a vastly superior\r\nforce, and worsted after a resistance which was all the more desperate that\r\nwe knew what to expect from such an enemy in case of defeat. The ferocity\r\nof the German burgher, backed by his liberators in overwhelming strength,\r\nliterally baffles description. I fell in a melee in front of the eastern\r\ngate under a blow from a spear-shaft, which broke the visor clasp of my\r\nshako right over my left ear. When I recovered my senses I was in the\r\ncustody of a young \"Death Hussar,\" of whose generous treatment of me more\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAME DAY, afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe number of my companions in misfortune now collected here is nearly\r\nthree hundred. Our departure Russia-ward, which had been fixed for noon\r\nto-day, seems to have been countermanded for the present.\r\n\r\nOur surprise is mainly attributed to some laxity on the part of our Saxon\r\nfriends, whose German hearts have naturally mellowed since the French\r\neagles have taken their homeward flight. This forenoon our brave general,\r\nmortally wounded in his effort to retrieve the disgrace, was buried with\r\nthe honors of war at Boitzenburg, half a mile from here. We lost altogether\r\nfive hundred dead and wounded, but inflicted a severe loss on the enemy,\r\nwho was the attacking party. As near as I can learn, his force consisted of\r\na large brigade of cavalry, four companies of Russian and three of Prussian\r\ninfantry, artillery in proportion, besides the few hundred Cossacks and\r\narmed citizens we had scared out of Lueneburg on the day before.\r\n\r\nNow to return to my story. Perhaps you have not forgotten, my dear parents,\r\nmy reference, four years ago, to the notorious Schill, chief of a corps of\r\nPrussian partisans, a brave and devoted patriot, who gave us no little\r\ntrouble. Shortly after that time he was pursued by a force of Danes and\r\nHollanders, our allies, all the way to Stralsund, and killed in a brave\r\nfight. His brother now commands the \"Death Hussars\" in the Prussian\r\nservice. My captor is a Brunswicker of noble birth and character, who\r\nspeaks very good French, and recognized me by name and face in connection\r\nwith an incident near Hamburg which had impressed him favorably with my\r\nhumanity. He seemed to have resolved to do all in his power for my\r\nprotection except directly favoring my escape. After he had shielded me\r\nfrom the burghers' mob and furnished me with a modest suit of citizen's\r\nclothes in order to disguise my rank, I was still encumbered by my\r\nregulation hat, which betrayed me to every eye. He proposed to provide me\r\nwith a skull-cap from a friend's wardrobe, and left me to wait for him in a\r\nseemingly deserted lane, a square only from his lodgings. Scarcely,\r\nhowever, had he turned the corner when I was overtaken by an athletic\r\njourneyman baker, who, pouncing upon me with frantic yells, attracted two\r\nother citizens to the spot, and all now seized hold of me with a vigor\r\nconveying the soothing impression that my agony would be brief. Acting upon\r\nthe old adage, that while there is life there is hope, I protracted my\r\nexistence by twining my arms around a small linden tree and dealing out\r\nsuch blows with my heavy riding-boots as I could in that awkward position.\r\nAt the same time I summoned to my aid all the power of a healthy pair of\r\nlungs, which my mother often predicted would yet make some noise in the\r\nworld, and just before my wind gave out under the pressure of the\r\nbakerman's thumbs, my strategy resulted in the desired success. Shouting\r\nand running at the top of his might, my noble rescuer was soon on the spot\r\nwith the skull-cap in one hand and his drawn sabre in the other. In a\r\ntwinkling the flat of his blade had loosened the hold of my executioners,\r\nwhom he fearlessly berated as cowardly villains for laying hands upon a\r\nprisoner already in his power, and whom he pursued with threats that\r\nvisibly quickened their retreating pace. Thanking Heaven for the favor of\r\npermitting him to save my life once more, he now informed me that he had\r\ndone all for me that his own oath and duty permitted, and hoped I should be\r\nable to make the best use of my improved situation. At my urgent request,\r\nhowever, he consented to accompany me to my lodgings, where I had that very\r\nmorning left my portfolio and a gold watch, not dreaming of the surprise\r\nthat subverted my fate in the course of the day. My landlord, still\r\ngratefully reminiscent of my courteous behavior toward him and his family\r\non the day of our victory, promptly delivered my property, with hearty\r\napologies for his inability to do more for me at present; and,\r\nsignificantly referring to a Prussian captain then at supper in the lower\r\nstory, he quietly pressed into my hand a shining silver thaler, which I as\r\nquietly returned with thanks, for the simple reason that I was even then\r\nmore able to give than he. \"God bless you, my gracious gentleman!\" were his\r\nlast words as I pressed his honest fist and assured him that if ever in my\r\npower his kindness should be remembered.\r\n\r\nNight had closed around me when I reached the sombre street with my\r\nmagnanimous protector. After exchanging names, birthplace and the residence\r\nof our respective parents in our memorandum-books, I thanked him for all\r\nwith a fulness of heart to which the moisture of his own thoughtful blue\r\neyes most eloquently responded, and as he rapidly walked away my\r\nreflections upon the humanity of war were not such as would have\r\nrecommended my promotion to the great captain in whose thankless service I\r\nam daily exposing my life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BASHKIR.]\r\n\r\nHere, then, I was left absolutely friendless in a hostile town in which my\r\nlife was at the mercy of almost every inhabitant. And my poor brothers,\r\nwhat had become of them? How could I find out? My rescuer had informed me\r\nthat the prisoners had already been transported into the country, and that\r\nthe wounded were being cared for at the town-hall. In this dilemma my\r\nchoice was not difficult. Deliberately walking into a tavern where the\r\nRussian staff were engaged in brewing punch, I declared myself a prisoner,\r\nhungry, and anxious to join my comrades, whose fate I wished to share. I\r\ndid not conceal the fact that I hoped to find two brothers among them. To\r\nmy agreeable surprise, I found these officers kindly-disposed,\r\nwell-educated men, speaking either French or German fluently. Supper was\r\ninstantly ordered for me, but, though a fast of fifteen hours was gnawing\r\nat my stomach, I could not prevail upon myself to taste anything before\r\nhaving seen our wounded, which I asked and obtained leave to do\r\nimmediately. An orderly was directed to conduct me to the town-hall across\r\nthe square. Here I was distressed to find over sixty of our men and\r\nofficers of all arms more or less severely hurt, but none fatally, the\r\nunfortunates of that category, as rumor goes, having been _finished by the\r\ncitizens_ before the military took charge of them. I anxiously looked into\r\nevery familiar face, but my brothers were not there. No one could tell me\r\nthe names of our dead. Frank was seen alive after I fell, just before the\r\nclose of the fight, but of Louis nothing whatever was known. Still, I\r\nbreathed more freely. A Prussian surgeon in attendance with our own having\r\ncalled my attention to the contusion over my left ear, which had now\r\nswollen to the size of a small egg, I had it bathed and dressed.\r\n\r\nDuring my supper at the tavern two of the Russian officers, taking seats\r\naround my table, conversed very freely upon the topics of the day, and, I\r\nmust confess, with much delicate regard for the feelings of an enemy in my\r\ncondition. They had seen Napoleon in Moscow, and hoped soon to return his\r\nvisit in Paris. All Europe was tired of him, his own people not excepted.\r\nThe Bourbons would be restored and universal peace would follow. This was\r\ntheir favorite theme, to which, I candidly own, your son's heart was not a\r\ntotal stranger. I have long been convinced that Germany could not be\r\npermanently subdued, and that French rule was the most unpopular of all. My\r\nimpression is that this nation will henceforth unite and fight until the\r\nforeign yoke is shaken off for ever.\r\n\r\nSupper over, I was informed that I could not be conveyed to my\r\nfellow-prisoners until morning, and that I might share the mattress of a\r\nFrench sergeant-major confined in an upper room, which turned out to be the\r\ngarret. Imagine my surprise on recognizing my favorite Delatre, though his\r\nface was black with mud and powder and his elegant form disguised in the\r\nlinen gown of a Mecklenburger teamster! His sleep was too sweet and\r\nprecious to be disturbed, and I much enjoyed his wonder when, awaking at\r\nthe break of day, he beheld the countenance of one whom he had numbered\r\namong the dead. Our mutual stories were soon told. Delatre had made an\r\nattempt to escape, but was recaptured, did not tell a very plausible tale,\r\nand was held for better identification in the morning. Of my brothers he\r\nknew only that they were both alive when I fell. It was supposed by the\r\nsurvivors of the company that if I was not killed by the blow I must have\r\nbeen crushed to death by horses' hoofs and cannon-wheels soon afterward.\r\n\r\nMy presence in the house proved to be a fortunate coincidence for my friend\r\nDelatre, since it required my written statement and parole of honor to\r\nclear him of the suspicion of being a spy. These formalities accomplished,\r\nthree very slightly wounded fusiliers from the hospital were added to our\r\nnumber, and we were at once conveyed to this hamlet, on the east side of\r\nthe Elbe, where we found our fellow-sufferers quartered in the spacious\r\noutbuildings of a comfortable-looking farm. A deafening shout arose from\r\none corner of the captive throng so soon as our faces could be\r\ndistinguished; and need I, dear parents, describe the scene which\r\nimmediately followed when all three of your sons, after a heart's agony of\r\ntwenty-four hours, once more, alive and well, fell into each other's arms?\r\n\r\nFrank, with the exception of a few buttons, was still in possession of his\r\nfull regimentals, but poor Louis's condition, as already mentioned, was\r\npitiable enough. My vest and overalls and half of my necktie restored him\r\nto relative decency, and out of a blanket which I purchased at the\r\nfarmhouse he is at this moment engaged in planning an elegant-looking Talma\r\ncloak.\r\n\r\nIt is significantly remarked that among the three hundred\r\nprisoners--destined to Siberia, I suppose--there is not a single Saxon.\r\nThere are reasons of state for this discrimination without a doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\nON A HALT, 5th April, noon.\r\n\r\nIt was not far from sunset last evening when we began to move under the\r\nescort of about sixty Cossacks. Our course lay along the east bank of the\r\nElbe, and we are _promised_ to be taken to Russia by way of Berlin. It was\r\nnear ten o'clock last night before we reached an enclosed farmyard secure\r\nenough to hold so many birds, and we went supperless to bed on a munificent\r\nlitter of straw. Frank's humorous stories and mimicry of our friends the\r\nenemies answered admirably for dessert.\r\n\r\nI was one of the first on foot this morning to take a good look at our\r\nescort. These semi-barbarians feel so secure in our utter helplessness that\r\nscarcely half a dozen of them remained on guard after the break of day.\r\nHere they lay stretched in the dew in every conceivable attitude of\r\nwell-earned repose, snoring in concert almost under the very feet of their\r\nponies, who enjoy in a standing position their equine dreams of home on the\r\ndistant steppe. The whole barnyard scene, riders, horses and prisoners,\r\ncomposed one of the most striking pictures of which I ever formed a part,\r\nand to which my hasty sketches, herewith enclosed, do not aspire to do\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nThese Cossacks, or more properly Bashkirs, seem to belong to a different\r\ntribe from the Knights of the Don we captured nearly three weeks ago, and\r\nrepresent mentally and physically a less advanced type. There is no\r\npicturing to yourself exactly such faces as these unless you have once seen\r\na specimen, upon which your imagination may then work _ad libitum_,\r\nwithout fear of exaggeration in the direction of the grotesque. A\r\nmythological cross between the fabled satyr and the domestic creature which\r\nfurnishes the Westphalia ham is the nearest approach I can suggest to this\r\ntype of humanity. How much of their dusky complexion is due to the sun and\r\nhow much to the earth could only be determined by an exhaustive experiment\r\nwith soap and water, the virtue of which, to them, is still an undiscovered\r\nblessing. To describe the extent to which the Bashkir carries his contempt\r\nfor cleanliness in every function of daily life would require pages, and\r\nprematurely disgust you with my interesting subject. The atmosphere for\r\nhalf a hundred feet around a middle-aged Bashkir has no parallel in any\r\nsensation known to the human nostril. His sheepskin cloak, jacket or vest,\r\nas the case may be, teems with animal life, of which the wearer alone seems\r\nto be unconscious. In feature these people approach the Tartar type, of\r\nwhich, however, the stiff, wispy, yellow hair and beard, the small piggish\r\neye, flat nose and fleshy Ethiopian lips seem to mark a characteristic\r\nvariety. Many of them walk clumsily or with a stoop, and show other\r\nsymptoms of grovelling habits and strong drink. As a rule, the Bashkirs,\r\nlike the Cossacks, are armed with lances; among our custodians several\r\ncarry long rifles; and at Lueneburg I even saw a few of these singular\r\nwarriors with bows and arrows, though perhaps more for show than for use.\r\nAs fighting soldiers they strike me as greatly overrated: their native\r\ninstincts seem to qualify them much better for scouts and marauders. Both\r\nthe Bashkir and Cossack when in action excel in the arts of\r\nself-preservation, skilfully manoeuvring around the verge of danger,\r\nseeking the weak points, and if by force of numbers and long lances now and\r\nthen succeeding in a charge _a fond_ upon a baggage-train, yet easily\r\npersuaded into wholesome prudence by a bristling line of bayonets or a\r\nwell-directed volley. Their battle-cry is the same as that of the English,\r\n\"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!\" only more melodious; and the same may be said of\r\ntheir songs, which fall much more agreeably upon a musical ear than the\r\npopular ballads and comical rhymes of our Britannic neighbors. I wish I\r\ncould speak as favorably of their religious devotions, which combine the\r\nmost bigoted and ludicrous exercises I ever heard of in a Christian sect.\r\nBoth the Don and the Bashkir Cossacks belong to the Greek Church, but\r\nwhether their mode of worship is the orthodox form or adulterated with\r\nBashkir improvements, I am not able to state. It is interesting to note\r\nhere that the most extravagant professions are indulged in by the older\r\nmembers of the congregation, while the younger seem content to go through\r\nthe principal motions, and not a few even slyly exchange quizzical glances\r\nover the prostrate backs of their seniors in superstition. Perhaps light\r\nwill dawn some day even on the benighted banks of the Don and the Volga.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CIBULSKY.]\r\n\r\nOf the most rudimentary education these simple people do not exhibit a\r\ntrace. Reading and writing appear to them the acme of human science, which\r\nthe poor Cossack may never hope to reach on this side of the Styx. When a\r\nmap is spread before them at random, they promptly inquire which is the\r\nside of the rising sun, and then turn that very properly to their right,\r\nbut beyond that their intelligence comes to a halt. Streams, roads and\r\nboundary-lines are to them only a labyrinth of confusion. Even as scouts\r\nand foragers they would be nearly useless without local guides; hence\r\nGerman officers have been added to their native leaders since they left the\r\nRussian border. The commander of this force is a renegade Pole, a Prussian\r\nsubject, by name Cibulsky, _anglice_ onion-man--a remarkable coincidence,\r\nin view of his favorite diet. Though he treats me with becoming respect, he\r\nis not the sort of man to win my affections.\r\n\r\nThough intellectually obtuse, the Cossack must not be supposed to lack\r\neither sagacity or common sense. On the contrary, the keenness of his\r\ninstinct and perception, as in the case of most savages, is quite\r\nremarkable. Human nature seems to him an open book, and it is instructive\r\nto watch his ingenuity in getting the upper hand in a bargain, a bet or a\r\ngame of chance. This morning I felt anxious to secure a sketch of one of\r\ntheir typical faces, undisfigured by the traditional beard, but coaxing did\r\nnot succeed. A few silbergroschen which I then displayed--all I claimed to\r\npossess--were merrily gobbled up by right of conquest and divided among the\r\ngroup around me. I felt near the end of my wits, when, observing a dirty\r\npack of cards protruding from the pocket of my subject, I asked permission\r\nto show him a trick. It was one of those parlor-magic sleights of\r\nhand--like Columbus's egg, the simplest trick in the world when you know\r\nit. I never saw Bashkirs' eyes look half as large as on that occasion, and\r\nhalf a dozen beards at once were put upon the market at the same price. For\r\nwant of time, however, I had to decline all except the one I had first\r\nselected, which rapidly fell under the dexterous scissors of brother Frank;\r\nand opposite is my sketch.\r\n\r\nOf military drill there is very little in Cossack training in the French or\r\nPrussian sense of the word, although the discipline is much better than\r\nmight be expected from such irregular troops. Their control of their horses\r\nis unsurpassable, and greatly assisted by the natural docility of the\r\nanimal itself. In size below the standard of our lightest cavalry, these\r\nugly little beasts display uncommon strength and endurance. Possibly a\r\ncross between the Arab and the Percheron might, on a larger scale, produce\r\na heavy and yet spirited head like that of the bright-eyed Cossack or\r\nUkraine horse, but to attain an equally fantastic neck and rump some less\r\nsymmetrical elements would have to be resorted to.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of horses, I am on foot at present, as you may well suppose, but\r\nthat only brings me all the nearer to my fellow-sufferers, who, like\r\nmyself, are in need of all the sympathy within their reach. Our Bashkirs\r\nbeing, upon the whole, a good-natured set of fellows and much the worse for\r\nwear, we hope to get along without serious trouble; and for my part I shall\r\nkeep a sharp lookout once we reach a familiar section of country. It looks\r\nas if our route would take us through Doemitz, one of my former posts. If\r\nso, patience!\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLIS, near Doemitz, Tuesday, 6th April.\r\n\r\nYesterday, at 2 P. M., we halted near a village five miles from here to\r\nsecure the first decent meal since we broke camp. Our sub-officers and\r\nprivates received good pickled meat with vegetables, pumpernickel (black\r\nbread) and rye whiskey. The officers were taken into the village and\r\nbilleted on comfortable houses for refreshments. Before I started I cut out\r\nof the belt of my drawers six napoleons d'or, which I divided between my\r\nbrothers, informing them that we were not far from Doemitz. They understood\r\nme well, and wished me God-speed, promising to follow my example if any\r\nopportunity occurred before they were exchanged. Their last injunction was\r\nto report them to you, my dear parents, in good health and spirits and\r\nbravely resigned to fate; and it was mainly the hope and desire to treat\r\nyou to this satisfaction that nerved me to the risk and pain of separation\r\nfrom the dear boys in their deplorable condition. I would have given one\r\nhalf of my remaining life to be able to carry them away in my breeches\r\npockets. It was because they truly felt this that they cheerfully forgave\r\nme this desertion. God bless and protect them for ever, for better sons and\r\nbrothers and truer soldiers never lived!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BASHKIR SHORN AND COMBED.]\r\n\r\nIt was here that I had resolved to attempt my escape, as for many miles\r\naround I had, during a protracted occupancy, gained a number of personal\r\nfriends, whose feelings I hoped to find unaltered by reverse of fortune. By\r\nthe favor of Heaven I was destined to succeed, so far, beyond expectation.\r\nMy captain, sub-lieutenant and myself were billeted on one of the last\r\nhouses on the road leading to Doemitz, and in charge of a single Bashkir, a\r\ngrizzly, good-humored old fellow, and not the very brightest of the lot.\r\nAfter seeing us comfortably seated around a savory dinner, he squarely\r\nestablished himself in the front-door, where he was soon absorbed in the\r\ndissection of a huge plate of fishes steeped in fragrant linseed oil. I\r\nshould here add that spoons and forks seem unknown to the Bashkir family,\r\nexcept as trophies of war, especially when they happen to be of silver.\r\nAfter replenishing my French stomach by means of a regular Mecklenburger\r\nappetite, I left my companions engaged in garnishing their pockets with the\r\nremnants of the feast, and stepped out into the yard bareheaded and\r\ncarelessly picking my teeth. Having secured the good-will of my Bashkir\r\nfriend by tasting a bite or two of his greasy fish, I proceeded to\r\nentertain him with a variety of gymnastic pranks, especially challenging\r\nhis admiration by balancing his lance on the end of my nose until it looked\r\nas flat as his own. This complimentary trick delighted him to such an\r\nextent that the corners of his mouth carried the tips of his broom-sedge\r\nmoustache several inches behind his ears. There was not a human being in\r\nthe street or yard, the bulk of the population having flocked out to stare\r\nat the rest of the prisoners. Pretending to play with the Bashkir's horse,\r\nwhich was despatching its oats near the garden-gate, I passed repeatedly\r\naround the corner of the house, gradually increasing the intervals of my\r\nreappearance until I had succeeded in fastening the bridle to the fence by\r\nthe nearest imitation possible of a gordian knot. Then coming into view\r\nonce more, and beholding my confiding jailer about to seal the fate of his\r\nlast fish, I again put the corner of the house between him and me, this\r\ntime to return no more.\r\n\r\nMy next prank was to leap from the saddle of the Cossack steed over the\r\nfence into the garden, and thence over another fence into a shady orchard,\r\nwithout being seen by mortal eye. At the outer end of an adjoining barnyard\r\nan old shed with a sunken thatched roof beckoned me into its friendly\r\nshelter, and there, between some old hay-ladders and broken wheels, I\r\ntwisted myself through the rotten straw into a cavity to which I confided\r\nmy trembling body until dusk. There was of course a moment of critical\r\nsuspense, but except the faint, hesitative bark of a small dog that rushed\r\npast my hiding-place and suddenly turned back as if on a false alarm, there\r\nwas not a sound or a sign indicating that my movements had been observed or\r\nthat search was being made for the fugitive. Did not the jolly old hero\r\nknow the difference between two and three, or had he forgotten me over his\r\nfish?\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, the last stroke of the village curfew found me once\r\nmore in the open air. There were just stars enough peeping out between the\r\nfleeting clouds to light my devious path through brush and field to the\r\nhouse of a trusty friend, whom I aroused from his peaceful slumber at\r\neleven o'clock. He is the same forester (_Oberfoerster_) of whose attachment\r\nfor me I mentioned several instances in my last year's correspondence. His\r\ndelight on recognizing me was unfeigned, and he would have been too happy\r\nto shelter me for any length of time but for the fact that the same hostile\r\ncommand that had captured us in Lueneburg was now retreating toward Doemitz,\r\nhaving again been driven across the Elbe by the expected advance of Marshal\r\nDavoust's corps. Of course I cannot remain here to compromise my friend,\r\nbut shall proceed two leagues farther, to the house of a wealthy farmer,\r\nwhere I may be concealed until enabled to reach the South Baltic coast.\r\nThere, at Christinenfeld, near Kluetz, I shall find more friends, my trunk\r\nwith money, clothes and other effects, if this property has not been\r\nbetrayed into the enemy's hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nELDENA, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, 15th April.\r\n\r\nHere I am, since the 8th, safely housed with my old friend, the hospitable\r\nfarmer. Yesterday, in a suitable disguise, I visited a public functionary,\r\nson of the county judge (_Oberamtmann_), with whom I was quartered four\r\nyears ago, and upon whose discretion I could rely. I broached the subject\r\nof a pass under an assumed name and nationality wherewith to reach Kluetz,\r\nonly twenty-four leagues away. Speaking as I do the German language, and\r\neven the Plattdeutsch dialect, almost like a native, I had hoped that my\r\nfriend would not hesitate to assume that risk. But upon his exhibiting to\r\nme the stringent orders lately received upon that subject, and mentioning\r\nthe penalty attached to detection, I did not insist upon my request. I\r\nshall undertake the journey as best I can, without a passport, _a la garde\r\nde Dieu_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTINENFELD, 17th April.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning, Good Friday, I rode from Eldena to Ludwigslust in\r\ncompany with a gamekeeper well known in this section. Thence I walked to\r\nSchwerin, the capital of the duchy, thence took stage to Gravismuehlen, and\r\nlastly footed it again to Kluetz, accomplishing the journey of twenty-four\r\nleagues between 3 A. M. and 9 P. M. Here I found the people as kindly\r\ndisposed as ever, and my trunk unmolested. My dear mother, who never rated\r\nme as the wittiest if the most accomplished of her boys, may possibly feel\r\nmore hopeful upon learning by what _ruse de guerre_ I managed to traverse\r\nthe capital of Mecklenburg-Schwerin without a passport in such times as\r\nthese. In addition to the usual civil police, every gate of the city was\r\nguarded by a military argus not likely to be caught napping. In Ludwigslust\r\nI had read a proclamation offering a reward for every Frenchman captured\r\nwithin the state. While resting on a milestone a short distance out of\r\nSchwerin, and wiping the sweat of agony from my brow, I noticed the\r\nestablishment of a florist on the other side of the road. Thither I stepped\r\nat once, and selecting a beautiful early rose in full bloom, I had it\r\npotted for transportation. Then dusting off my boots and disarranging my\r\ncravat, I placed the flower-pot in my cap, and taking this novel passport\r\nupon my left arm, I abstractedly sallied forth toward the redoubtable gate.\r\nVery much as I expected, all eyes were turned upon the beautiful early\r\nflower, whose carrier passed unobserved. I felt so exultant over the\r\nsuccess of my stratagem that I had the audacity to call for half a bottle\r\nof French wine, with bread and cheese, at the first inn I came to, and to\r\nenjoy my treasonable meal right under the nose of a vociferous Prussian\r\n_Kuerassier-hauptmann_ expounding the latest news from the seat of war to\r\nwhat I took to be a knot of terrified civil functionaries. The drift of it\r\nall was that the beak of the French eagle was once more turned to the East.\r\n_Inde Irae._\r\n\r\n\r\nAT A COUNTRY-SEAT IN HOLSTEIN, Danish ground.\r\n\r\nMy stay near Kluetz was of short duration, owing to another proclamation\r\nfrom the ruler of this duchy, ordering the arrest of all straggling\r\nFrenchmen, and their delivery to the nearest Russian or Prussian outpost,\r\nunder penalty of treason. My friends, whom I did not wish to expose any\r\nlonger, kindly recommended me to this place, where I have been very\r\nhospitably received. How long this may last is, however, uncertain, as it\r\nis feared Sweden may compel Denmark into an alliance against the French.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHWANENSEE, Mecklenburg, 29th May.\r\n\r\nI was driven from Danish soil by a false alarm in regard to Swedish\r\nmovements, and am the guest here of another old friend, Baron Haesseler,\r\nwith whom I was quartered three years ago. But this is Mecklenburg again,\r\nand not safe either for me or my generous host. This Wandering-Jew sort of\r\na life is demoralizing me fast: I cannot hold out much longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLE BUeLOW, at Gudow, Duchy of Lauenburg, 6th June.\r\n\r\nThank Heaven! Mecklenburg is once more behind me. This is still the enemy's\r\ncountry, but its little sovereign has not yet issued any proclamation\r\nthirsting for French blood. After leaving my Danish retreat I spent a few\r\nweeks at Kluetz under the tile-roof of a henhouse, where I was nearly crazed\r\nby the heat and confinement. Dropping crumbs to a family of friendly mice\r\nwho have not heard of the proclamation was my only pastime. At Schwanensee\r\nI made the acquaintance of the Landmarschallin von Buelow, a noble and\r\naccomplished lady, who managed to convey me to this manor, her place of\r\nresidence. She is one of the few in the land who has not yet learned to\r\nhate us Frenchmen \"as we deserve.\" She is the mother of two sons, the elder\r\nof whom, like all young men of his class, is in the field against us. To\r\nthe younger, a bright lad of sixteen, I was introduced this morning as his\r\npreceptor, Mr. Fr. J. Dierks, a native of Freiburg, Baden. This is my\r\nidentity for all who may know me here. The lord of this manor, who, for\r\nreasons of public business, resides at Ratzeburg, a few miles from here,\r\nknows me in no other capacity. He seems to think much of me, and placed a\r\nhorse and his hunting-ground at my disposal. Even my trunk was sent after\r\nme here through the kindness of the countess. But in the midst of all this\r\ncomfort, right from the Kluetzer henhouse, I feel restless and unhappy. My\r\nplace is not here. Had I remained on the Danish side I could now, as things\r\nhave turned out, pass through Holstein to Hamburg, which is again in\r\npossession of Davoust's corps. I may accomplish it yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUDOW, 7th July.\r\n\r\nI hope soon to be able to forward you my letters, which I have just now\r\nfinished transcribing from the cipher. Since the middle of last month there\r\nreigns some sort of a truce, but up to date I have tried in vain to get off\r\nmy mail or to slip through the outposts in person. The Cossacks are\r\nswarming through this section, and have doubled all the picket-lines. It is\r\npart of my duty here to furnish supplies to those stationed within the\r\nLandmarschall's domain; and though, in that capacity, I am on the best of\r\nterms with our protectors, they have shown no disposition yet to help me\r\nacross the Stekenitz, a muddy stream which forms the neutral line between\r\nthe hostile armies. Think of it, my dear parents, only a few miles off I\r\nshould find the French flag, French uniforms, comrades, friends, almost\r\nhome once more! It is very trying to hold up my head under a false role and\r\nto sign my false name daily to a dozen papers. If detected now, so near the\r\nlines, no power on earth could save me from the death of a spy, and it is\r\nvery difficult for me sometimes not to look upon myself as a deserter.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 10th.\r\n\r\nFrom the countess I learned to-day that the crown-prince of Sweden\r\n(ex-Marshal Bernadotte), commanding the invading army, having learned that\r\na French officer or spy was concealed on Baron Haesseler's domain, quartered\r\nupon him a squad of hussars, who are making diligent search for me. They\r\nmay find my trail to this place at any hour. I am on the wing this moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOWE, a country-seat near Ratzeburg, 1st August.\r\n\r\nIf ever I was in a tight place, it is now. General Tettenborn, a Badener by\r\nbirth, commanding the Russian forces posted five miles from Gudow, wishes\r\nto make the personal acquaintance of his countryman, Mr. Dierks. The\r\nSwedish hussars have furnished him my description, and the protege of the\r\ncountess von Buelow is suspected to be no other than the mysterious guest of\r\nBaron Haesseler. My disguise and concealment here at the house of a most\r\ngenerous friend has successfully baffled detection so far, but the old\r\nLandmarschall having joined in the pursuit of me to vindicate his own\r\nloyalty, I am not safe here any longer. My devoted host has just devised a\r\nplan for my conveyance to Kluetz, whence I must absolutely try to reach\r\nHolstein and Hamburg without delay.\r\n\r\n\r\nKLUeTZ, 6th August.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 2d-3d inst. saw me safely landed here. The place is full\r\nof Swedish troops, and several officers are quartered in the house of which\r\nmy hen-coop is a dependancy. I have but little paper left to write for\r\npastime, but my faithful mice have not forgotten me. Very unlike many human\r\nbeings, they are gratefully looking up toward the source of their daily\r\nbread, and even standing on their hind legs against the wall, as if anxious\r\nto pay me a visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n9th August.\r\n\r\nNo change yet in the situation within or without. If I could hope that\r\nDavoust's corps would push across the Elbe at once and drive the Swedes,\r\nRussians and Prussians to where they belong, I would remain here and await\r\nhis coming. But that is still uncertain, and my position is becoming\r\nuntenable. I have wished a thousand times I had never left my brothers.\r\nTheir fate is enviable compared to mine. To-night I shall get a reply to a\r\nproposition I made for my transfer to Holstein by water. I have ample funds\r\nto accomplish it if all else is favorable. The French advance has reached\r\nLubeck.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUBECK, 12th August.\r\n\r\nHeaven be praised, dearest parents! I am free and once more among my own!\r\n\r\nIn the night of the 10th-11th my plans culminated at last in my conveyance\r\nin a fisherman's boat across the south-west corner of the Baltic to\r\nNeustadt, in Danish Holstein, whence I proceeded to this city as fast as\r\nthe best horse within reach could carry me. I must forbear, from want of\r\ntime, giving you to-day the particulars of this dangerous and providential\r\nescape, which would appear to you almost incredible. I cannot but attribute\r\nthe special protection of a kind Providence to a recognition of such of my\r\nqualities of heart as you, my dear parents, have so religiously cultivated\r\nin your children, and which nine years' absence from home and the varied\r\nexperiences of a cruel and relentless war have never yet obliterated. I\r\nbelieve I have always striven to be faithful to my duty, kind and just to\r\nmy inferiors and humane to our enemies. It is this consciousness that ever\r\nsustained my hope in the darkest hour of peril. It told me that I was too\r\ngood to die ignominiously at the end of a Mecklenburger pitchfork or hempen\r\nrope. Again, thanks and praise to Whom they are due!\r\n\r\n\r\nLUeNEBURG, 25th August.\r\n\r\nI lost no time in reporting to head-quarters at Lubeck, and was at once\r\nordered here, where I found again united all of our command who fought\r\ntheir way out of this place on the day of my capture. Of our poor\r\nprisoners, only one, Sautier, a corporal of artillery, seems to have made\r\nhis escape. This occurred at Colberg, Prussia, on the Baltic, where our\r\nboys were embarked for Russia, Riga being their port of destination. At\r\nthat time both Frank and Louis enjoyed remarkably good health, and, summer\r\napproaching, Russia had lost much of its terror in their minds. The trip by\r\nland was performed in short marches and without any unusual hardships. Long\r\nbefore they reached Berlin their escort was replaced by another of\r\nexclusively Don Cossacks. Sautier reached Denmark by water from Wismar,\r\nwhere he had travelled in various disguises, principally following the\r\ncoast. My own escape was not discovered by Captain Cibulsky until next day.\r\nIt appears that the old Bashkir, on returning my captain and sub-lieutenant\r\nto the caravan after dinner, made no report concerning the missing\r\nlieutenant, and when the roll-call betrayed my absence next morning the\r\nclannish Bashkirs played so adroitly into each other's hands that the\r\ncommander could not determine whom to hold accountable for the offence,\r\nand, after notifying the civil authorities to keep a lookout for me,\r\nresumed his march. After that accident, however, the captive officers were\r\nnot permitted to leave camp for any purpose except under escort equal to\r\ntheir own number--one Cossack one prisoner, one Cossack one prisoner, and\r\nso on--which would not leave room for miscounts. I heartily rejoice over\r\nthe impunity of my old friend of the doorsill, and only regret now not\r\nhaving had the presence of mind to tie a napoleon d'or into that\r\ntreacherous knot in his bridle. But, _qui sait?_ we may meet again!\r\n\r\n\r\n27th August.\r\n\r\nYesterday I received my full pay in arrears, and am again blazing forth in\r\ncomplete regimentals after a _bourgeois_ neglige of nearly five months.\r\nTo-day, when taking my first official round through the town, I suddenly\r\nfound myself face to face with the journeyman baker who had undertaken to\r\nput a stop to my earthly career on the fatal 2d of April. He turned pale as\r\ndeath, and seemed riveted to the ground. Taking hold of his chin, I asked\r\nhim whether he would think it strange to be sent before a court-martial and\r\nshot before next sunrise. The cowardly bully looked so contrite and\r\nchapfallen that I pitied him, and the fear that he might be dealt with just\r\nas he deserved caused me to dismiss him with an impressive admonition, of\r\nwhich the bystanders of his class may have taken to heart their respective\r\nshares. Before night the magnanimity of the French officer was the gossip\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\nI almost forgot to mention that I have also recovered my horse, which had\r\nbeen appropriated by a civil functionary and smuggled into the country\r\nupon the return of our forces. Although I shall not be reassigned to the\r\ncoast-guard service, I am permitted to retain the animal at my own expense.\r\nWe learn to-day that Marshal Davoust is advancing rapidly through\r\nMecklenburg, and has already issued a proclamation from Schwerin, where\r\nroses count for passports. In a very few days we shall be sufficiently\r\nreorganized to follow. Every step will bring me nearer to my brothers. God\r\nbless you all, my dear parents and sisters! These leaves at last will be\r\nwafted homeward to-day. More in a few days from our eastward line of\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Lieutenant Diss Debar served in the corps of Davoust until the\r\ndeparture of Napoleon for Elba. The second invasion found him promoted to a\r\ncaptaincy, and engaged in the defence of Neu Breisach, which closed his\r\nmilitary career. After the restoration of the Bourbons the influence of his\r\nfather's Legitimist friends procured for him a comfortable position in the\r\nadministration of \"Waters and Forests,\" which he retained through all the\r\npolitical changes up to within a few years of his death, in 1864, in the\r\neighty-fifth year of his age. His brother Frank was exchanged in 1815, and\r\nreturned to France, but \"poor little Louis\" was not destined to the same\r\ngood fortune. He died at Riga in January, 1814, from amputation of his\r\nfrozen feet, the result of barbarous exposure.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[B] The writer of these letters, Joseph Diss Debar, served with the corps\r\nof Marshal Davonst. Before the French Revolution his father had filled the\r\noffice of intendant of domains of the prince-cardinal de Rohan-Guemenee, of\r\nroyal necklace memory, then residing on his estates at Saverne, Alsace, in\r\nthe diocese of Strassburg, of which he was the beneficiary. Soon after the\r\ncapture of the Bastille the revolutionary movement spread to this locality,\r\nand destroyed, imprisoned or drove into exile all the avowed adherents of\r\nthe royal cause, including the cardinal and his friends. The greater part\r\nof the Saverne refugees gathered at Ettenheim in Baden, only one league\r\nfrom the Rhine, where a large stipend, allowed to the cardinal by the\r\nBritish government, enabled him to keep his friends and followers above\r\nwant until they could find other means of support. Thirteen years later\r\nEttenheim also attracted the unfortunate duc d'Enghien, who in March, 1804,\r\nwas kidnapped by orders of Bonaparte and shot in the ditch at Vincennes.\r\nThe terror inspired by this high-handed _coup d'etat_, which destroyed the\r\n_emigres'_ safety upon neutral soil, caused many of the younger generation\r\nof exiles to return to their native country and to enter the army, the\r\nmilitary career being the only one open to them. Among these were the\r\nwriter and his two brothers, the oldest being then twenty-four and the\r\nyoungest seventeen years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery day I passed there in going between the room where I lodge and my\r\nbusiness. It was an old shop, full of trash, ambitious of being a\r\nbric-a-brac establishment, but its contents had neither beauty nor pedigree\r\nto recommend them, only age and cheapness. Its doorsill lay even with the\r\npavement, inviting custom by an easy access, while repelling it by its\r\nsqualor. The light entered hesitatingly through a cobwebbed window, as if\r\nloath to touch the unsightly objects within. Of these, some few had strayed\r\nthrough the door and stood in blinking confusion on the sidewalk--chairs\r\nwith three legs, desks with no shelves, sofas without seats, clocks\r\neternally silent, and ornaments maimed, cracked, and seamed with glue.\r\n\r\nIt was in this company I first saw him. He had dark eyes with heavy lids,\r\nthat gave a pathetic look to his face, and one eyebrow was slightly pointed\r\nnear its termination on the temple, while the other was straight--an\r\nirregularity often found in persons of erratic temperament. His nose,\r\nsensitive and refined, was in beautiful proportion to the face: his full\r\nlips and square chin were partly concealed by a curling brown beard and\r\nmoustache, and the hair, which met a forehead rather broad than high, was\r\nof the same color. Perhaps I should have mentioned that _he_ was a\r\nportrait.\r\n\r\nHow had he arrived among his present surroundings, standing on the dirty\r\nstreet, smeared with mud that passing feet cast in his face, splashed by\r\nrain, and torn from contact with the edges of chairs or the careless canes\r\nof pedestrians--even showing the print of a boot-heel impressed on one\r\ncheek? At times he disappeared for days together, as if lost in the maze\r\nwithin: then again I would see his tragic eyes gazing at me through a\r\npelting storm or his skin blistering under a blinding sun. Was it any\r\nwonder that I sought to save him from his capricious fate--that I pitied\r\nhim, that I bought him?\r\n\r\nI took the opportunity of doing so when the owner of the shop, whom I\r\nrespectfully christened Sticks, was absent, and was thereby enabled to\r\npurchase the portrait from a shock-headed boy in charge for the modest sum\r\nof two francs.\r\n\r\nMy acquisition gave me much pleasure, but, unfortunately, it immediately\r\nbecame the subject of an altercation between my two selves. I must here\r\nsay that my inner and outer self seldom agree, the latter being a\r\npractical man and a clerk in a retail lace business, while the former is an\r\nidealist who despises the other's employment and ridicules his opinions,\r\nfrequently bewailing the lot that links him to a clod without aspirations.\r\n\r\nIt was to settle this dispute that I resolved, if possible, to discover\r\nsome facts about the portrait's history, and for this purpose I stopped at\r\nthe shop next morning, fortunately finding the shock-headed boy alone. Old\r\nSticks would not have _given_ even an answer, his business being buying and\r\nselling.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get that picture I bought of you yesterday?\" I began.\r\n\r\n\"Think it's an old master?\" he asked with a wink.\r\n\r\n\"Will you answer my question, you blockhead?\" I said, threatening him with\r\nmy stick.\r\n\r\n\"I brought it from No. 42 Rue Notre Dame de Lorette,\" he whimpered,\r\navoiding the cane as if it recalled disagreeable memories.\r\n\r\n\"To whom did it belong?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak out, my man, and you shall have this for your reward.\" The proffered\r\nhalf-franc made him voluble.\r\n\r\n\"I was sent for it to No. 42. The concierge gave it to me. He had it\r\ncarefully wrapped up: that made me laugh when I saw it opened.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long ago did this happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"About six months. Where do _you_ live?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that to you, my young friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better not pass here often: the old man is furious that I sold the\r\npicture--asked me all about how you looked, and if you ever passed the\r\nshop. I told him I never saw you before, and that you had black hair and\r\nsquinted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I owe him one. He beat me last night, and went off this morning without\r\ngiving me a bite to eat. Last thing he said was, 'You are sure he squints?'\r\nI said, 'Yes, sure.'\"\r\n\r\nThen, as I gave him the silver, the boy said, \"Just mind the shop a moment,\r\nwhile I run and get something to eat;\" and off he went, leaving me in\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do about it?\" asked my inner self ironically.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to No. 42;\" and without awaiting the boy's return I set out.\r\n\r\nA few minutes brought me to the street. I passed No. 42 in review from the\r\nopposite side of the way, thinking I might get some idea of its occupants\r\nfrom the exterior. The house, wedged in by similar houses, possessed no\r\nparticular physiognomy. I gazed at each window in turn, and finally\r\ncrossing the street asked the concierge, \"What is the name of the artist\r\nliving in this house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only respectable people live here,\" he answered in a surly tone.\r\n\r\n\"When did he leave?\" I went on, determined not to notice his rudeness.\r\n\r\n\"There has never been one here since I came.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can remember a picture that you sold to a furniture-dealer in the\r\nRue St. Lazare about six months ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"No I can't. I never sold one.\"\r\n\r\n\"His boy told me he got it from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is mistaken: I never sold one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it merely passed through your hands. No harm will come to you if\r\nyou tell me what you know about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing,\" he exclaimed angrily, and began to pick up some scraps on\r\nthe floor, so that I could not see his face.\r\n\r\nEvidently suspecting there was something wrong, and that he might be held\r\naccountable, the man was prepared to deny everything, and my time being\r\nlimited I left. As I did so I saw a plainly-dressed individual approach\r\nhim, and on once looking back I thought from their gestures they were\r\nspeaking of me. Of course my inner self exclaimed, \"Absurd!\"\r\n\r\nFor two days after I was confined to my room by a slight illness, but on\r\nthe third, as I neared the furniture-shop, I noticed Sticks disconsolately\r\nseated in what might be called his best chair, seeing that the cover,\r\nthough faded, was whole, and it lacked but one arm. This total disregard\r\nfor the sanctity of his wares struck me as ominous, but confident, from the\r\nboy's description of me, that I should not be recognized, I went boldly\r\nforward. What was my astonishment to see him as I passed start from his\r\nseat and exclaim, \"Is it you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The boy has betrayed us,\" said I to my inner self.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he was bribed by another half-franc,\" replied he, as if sneering\r\nat my liberality.\r\n\r\n\"Let us see what old Sticks will do,\" I remarked in order to change the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThereupon we stopped before the excited man, who was trying vainly to calm\r\nhimself while he asked nervously, \"Can I show monsieur something? Something\r\ncheap, _cheap_--a bargain, artistic, grand, beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not this morning, thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, this is not kind. Enter a moment: the opportunity is there; do not\r\ndisappoint it.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood before me, and laying one knotty hand on my sleeve gently pushed\r\nme over the threshold, while he murmured, \"A bargain, beautiful, cheap.\"\r\nMephistopheles could not have looked more persuasive as, pointing his other\r\nhand--which matched his wares by the loss of a finger--to a worm-eaten\r\ncabinet, he leered at me with the only eye he had left.\r\n\r\n\"I could not carry it,\" I said with a shrug.\r\n\r\n\"I will send the article,\" he answered, eagerly pulling a soiled bit of\r\npaper and the end of a pencil from his pocket. \"What is monsieur's\r\naddress?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is anxious to know where I live: that is evident,\" said I to my usual\r\nconfidant as I moved on and stopped before a table which had once been\r\ninlaid, but which now presented the appearance of a painted beauty whose\r\nrouge has dropped off.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur's choice is wise,\" said the merchant, following me. \"Real Louis\r\nQuatorze: and besides its beauty it has a secret drawer to recommend it.\r\nThat, however, I can only show you in the privacy of your own apartment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he wants to steal the portrait,\" I remarked to the invisible\r\npresence accompanying me. Then I asked the dealer, watching him closely the\r\nwhile, \"Have you any pictures to sell?\"\r\n\r\nSticks coughed nervously, looked about him, and walked the whole length of\r\nhis shop, dusting the things with his red cap, before he spoke. He must\r\nhave been much preoccupied thus rashly to destroy the venerable appearance\r\nof his stock. Then he said, \"Perhaps _you_ might have one you would sell?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you mean the one I bought of you. Why do you want it? In what\r\ndoes its value lie? What is the secret connected with it?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man could not repress an involuntary \"Hush!\" Then recovering\r\nhimself, he asked, \"Will you sell it? I offer double what you gave.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head negatively.\r\n\r\n\"Name your price,\" he begged eagerly.\r\n\r\nI obstinately continued to shake my head. There must be some reason for his\r\nwanting it back, and I resolved to find this out before I parted with it.\r\nThereupon my inner self ejaculated \"Nonsense!\" but the dealer's anxiety was\r\ntoo evident, and his liberality too unusual, not to be suspicious.\r\n\r\n\"I must bid you good-morning,\" I said, in order to bring the matter to a\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n\"Stay a moment: I will explain, I will tell you all. A poor widow sold me\r\nthe picture: it was a portrait of the husband of her youth. Yesterday she\r\ncame to buy it back: she had saved the money for this purpose sou by sou.\r\nMonsieur will not be cruel, and I promise to divide the profits equally\r\nwith him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can name my price?\" I asked, stopping at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, monsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell the poor widow she had better spend her savings in buying a new\r\nhusband instead of an old portrait. You can mention me as a pretender.\"\r\nWith that I walked off, believing that I could come sooner to the truth by\r\nfeigning indifference.\r\n\r\nSeveral times during the day I imagined some one was watching me, and\r\nreturning home at night I was sure I was followed; which proved to be\r\ntrue, as on reaching my door the shock-headed boy from the shop passed and\r\nwhispered, \"Be careful! They are on your track;\" then disappeared before I\r\ncould ask an explanation.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if Sticks meditates a night-attack, and has sent the boy to\r\nreconnoitre?\" said I to my confidential friend.\r\n\r\n\"You had better bribe him to tell you,\" replied this ironical adviser.\r\n\r\nBut nothing happened until morning, when a woman, the concierge of the\r\nhouse I live in, knocked at the door and asked if it would be convenient\r\nfor me to pay my rent that day: it would oblige the proprietor. This was an\r\nunusual request, the rent not being due for a week to come; but I counted\r\nout the necessary sum, and handing it to her went on with my preparations\r\nto go out. Still she remained, and when I turned to see what detained her,\r\nI saw her eyes fixed on the portrait.\r\n\r\n\"It is so like my son,\" she said, observing my regard. \"Monsieur has not\r\nhad it long?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, a few days only.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor son was killed,\" she continued, wiping her eyes: \"he was a mason\r\nand fell from a scaffolding. If he had only been contented to be a\r\nstreet-paver, as I begged him, he would never have fallen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blessed are the lowly-minded, for being already down they cannot fall!\"\r\nThis voiceless remark I made to my other self as a warning.\r\n\r\n\"It is such a broken-up portrait that monsieur cannot want it. I would like\r\nto buy it for a little sum if monsieur would sell it. My poor son! That\r\nhole in the forehead especially looks like Jean when I saw him last.\" Here\r\nshe covered her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"How much did that one-eyed man give you to come and buy that portrait?\"\r\nasked I, guessing that this was an envoy of Sticks.\r\n\r\n\"He?\" she said, confused: \"it was no _he_.\" Then recovering herself:\r\n\"Monsieur is mistaken if he thinks I would take a bribe;\" after which the\r\nlady withdrew.\r\n\r\n\"Was not my question well thought of?\" asked I of my other self in triumph.\r\n\r\n\"I think you are becoming a monomaniac,\" was his complimentary reply.\r\n\r\nThe day passed uneventfully, although I still had a suspicion that I was\r\nwatched, but I had no means of making it a certainty. When I returned home\r\nmy first look was toward the portrait. It was still safe.\r\n\r\nAt that moment there was a knock at the door. I opened it, and found there\r\nmy washerwoman, or I should say my washerwoman's substitute, one whom I had\r\nnever before seen. She was a bright, talkative little thing, a pearl of\r\nsoapsuds, and said glibly that my usual attendant was ill, and she had come\r\ninstead. I told her I was glad she had.\r\n\r\nWhile putting down her basket her brown eyes took in the whole of my room,\r\nand she remarked with a shiver, \"What a sad home you live in!--gloomy, ugly\r\nlittle chamber.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your young man have a better one, my dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not my confessor,\" she answered saucily.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I were.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me be yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"No objections.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is the _joli garcon_ you condemn to share with you this gloomy\r\napartment?\" She pointed to the portrait.\r\n\r\n\"A dear friend of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"He looks as if he drank absinthe, and had broken his head on the pavement;\r\nnevertheless, I like him. Bring him to see me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Willingly: when shall we call?\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as possible: meanwhile I will carry this with me.\" She lightly\r\njumped on a chair, took my portrait and retreated with it to the door,\r\nsaying, \"Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, No. 42, to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so fast, please,\" said I, taking the canvas from her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Stingy fellow! you might let me have it. He would be so much surprised\r\nwhen you brought him _chez moi_ to see it hanging on the wall. Give it to\r\nme;\" and she held out her hand with a charming gesture.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, my dear: you may come and see it here whenever you like, but here\r\nit must remain.\"\r\n\r\nI turned and hung it on its accustomed nail: when I looked again she was\r\ngone. Not even the sound of her foot on the stairs nor a moving shadow on\r\nthe steps when I looked over the balustrade.\r\n\r\n\"Either the world is going mad, or I am,\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"You need not be in doubt which.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any one would think it odd. Could she be the forlorn widow in search of\r\nthe portrait of the husband of her youth?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does old Sticks look as if he could play a practical joke?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or my concierge?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or my washerwoman?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this radiant little bubble of soapsuds who was just here, what do you\r\nthink of her?\"\r\n\r\nBut my other self, having nothing more to say, was sensible enough to keep\r\nsilent, and we slept.\r\n\r\nIn dreams the pretty washerwoman and the portrait became mixed\r\ninextricably. I believed she looked like the portrait--that she was the\r\nportrait; and when I awoke in the morning and saw the melancholy eyes\r\nhanging opposite my bed, I could not help exclaiming, \"Pardi! she does look\r\nlike him! It is true her eyes are brighter and her dimpled chin rounder;\r\notherwise the faces are the same. And did she not invite me to the house\r\nfrom which the portrait had been brought? I must see her again--the sooner\r\nthe better.\" With this I arose and hurriedly dressed, my other self\r\nprotesting against my resolution the while; but as the physical power is\r\nall on my side, he was obliged to accompany me.\r\n\r\nWe went to No. 42 Notre Dame de Lorette, and were met by the same\r\ndisagreeable concierge that we had seen before. To my questions he answered\r\nthat no washerwoman lived in the house, and when I insisted he exclaimed\r\npathetically, \"For Heaven's sake go away! I have a wife and six children.\"\r\n\r\nI was so impressed by this startling information that I ejaculated, \"What a\r\nphilanthropist!\" whilst my inner self, who luckily has not the gift of\r\nspeech, said, \"What a fool!\" Then I remembered that asking after a\r\nwasherwoman in Paris without knowing her name was rather quixotic, and I\r\nwent my way.\r\n\r\nDuring the day I still had the disagreeable sensation of being watched. Men\r\nappeared to be noticing me from alleys, street-corners and windows, and\r\nonce I made a sale to an individual who I was sure observed me more than\r\nthe lace he was purchasing. When I passed the shop in the evening, Sticks\r\nneither looked at me nor returned my salutation, and when I half stopped to\r\nexamine a new piece of dilapidation on the sidewalk he whispered abruptly,\r\n\"Move on, I beg of you: _your_ custom is not wanted here.\"\r\n\r\nWas it strange that a series of the wildest conjectures should fill my\r\nmind? It was just before the Franco-German war, when the whole of Paris was\r\nin a fever of excitement and every event seemed to predict a political\r\ncrisis. But in what manner could I, a simple lace-selling clerk, be\r\nconnected with it? This last reflection of course emanated from my\r\nplain-talking self, who would rather believe the whole world mad than that\r\nanything important should happen to me. I was \"not made of the stuff that\r\ndistinction loves,\" he said, and begged me not to think that the eyes of\r\nthe Empire were upon me.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the house I tried to question my concierge about the pretty\r\ngirl who had brought home my clothes, but found my efforts useless. The\r\nwoman said she knew nothing of my washerwoman, not even her name. I tried\r\nby describing the girl to get a more definite answer. She intimated that\r\nshe would have little to do if she looked at every one going up or down the\r\nstairs; then burst into tears, and begged me to leave her--that she was\r\ndependent on her place for support; that her reputation was all she had;\r\nand more to the same effect, which I avoided by making a precipitate\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nI rushed to my room and to my glass, eagerly scanning the reflection\r\ntherein to see if any change in my appearance within the last few days\r\ncould cause people thus to avoid me, suspect me, and treat me as if\r\ncontaminated. It was the same insignificant face I had known from\r\nchildhood, with what my other self called a \"stupidly innocent expression.\"\r\nI next thought of examining the portrait, taking it from the wall for this\r\npurpose. It was certainly modern: the slightest acquaintance with art\r\nsettled this beyond doubt. (I must here acknowledge that my second self is\r\nrather a cultivated man; his discrimination has often been praised by the\r\nmembers of our firm; and it is owing to his delicate taste that I have been\r\nsent several times to Belgium to make large purchases of lace for our\r\nhouse; therefore I could rely on his judgment in this matter.) But might it\r\nnot conceal another? I held it between me and the light, and could see\r\nthrough it, not only where there were holes, but everywhere between the\r\ninterstices of the thinly-painted, badly-made canvas. I turned the back:\r\nthere was nothing but the name of the seller stamped upon it: it was not\r\nlikely he would remember who had bought this particular article. There was\r\nno frame, and I detached the cloth from the stretcher, that nothing might\r\nescape me. Not the slightest clew--no bit of paper, message or token. I put\r\nback the tacks, and was hanging my unsolved puzzle on the wall when I heard\r\na knock at the door.\r\n\r\nThis time it was my _bona-fide_ washerwoman, who came for the soiled\r\nclothes the other in her hasty retreat had forgotten, and as she gathered\r\nthem together I carelessly asked after the fair unknown.\r\n\r\n\"She is my niece,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Does she live with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: she lives in the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is her name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the dame ended her task by tying the clothes in a bundle, and\r\nseemed in haste to be off.\r\n\r\n\"Is it not rather strange that you should know neither your niece's name\r\nnor where she lives?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" she said, defiantly resting a hand on either hip: \"I will\r\nhave nothing more to do with it.\" Here the bundle at her feet received a\r\nkick which sent it spinning over the floor, and she would have left the\r\nroom had I not stood in her way.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you begin it?\" I asked quickly, seeing here a chance of solving\r\nthe mystery.\r\n\r\n\"She would take no refusal; and besides, she gave me twenty francs.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Merely to allow her to carry home your wash. I hope you found nothing\r\nmissing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. But listen: I will give you another twenty francs if you tell me\r\nall you know about her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make it thirty,\" she said eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"It shall be thirty.\"\r\n\r\n\"The young girl--\"\r\n\r\n\"The brown-eyed one who brought my wash?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. She came to my house on Friday last. Madame Trois, your concierge,\r\nhad given her my address. The girl said she must see you in your room, and\r\nmust have an excuse for going there--all for a bit of fun. But Madame Trois\r\ntold me to-day that it was a picture she wanted, for she gave her fifty\r\nfrancs the day before for trying to get it, and promised her as much more\r\nas it might cost if you should consent to sell it. When Madame Trois\r\nfailed, the girl asked what other woman went to your room, and she sent her\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then she is no niece of yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I had a niece she would not be running about alone in that way; but the\r\ngirl said if you should question me I must tell you she is my niece, and\r\ngive her any name I pleased. As if I did not have enough trouble naming my\r\nown children without puzzling over one for her! especially when she gave me\r\nbut twenty francs, and Madame Trois throwing it in my teeth that she got\r\nfifty! I am even with her now;\" and she held out her hand for the money\r\nwith the pose of a malignant Victory.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\"\r\n\r\n\"All about her, but Madame Trois says there is something wrong, for the\r\nhouse is watched by the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"Police!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Madame Trois is up to their tricks. Her husband that is dead was a\r\npoliceman, and she says those that don't dress in uniform are the worst.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame Trois says a great deal; for instance, she told me she knew nothing\r\nabout the girl, nor of you either, not even your name,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"_She_ was paid enough not to tell; besides, she is dreadfully afraid of\r\nthe police; and no wonder. Such a dance as her husband led her! though I\r\nmust say she deserved it. We have been friends for years.\"\r\n\r\nI saw there was nothing more to gain, so I paid the woman and dismissed\r\nher, while my two selves both talked at once, making a distracting duet\r\nthat nearly set me wild.\r\n\r\nHere was confirmation of my worst fears. I was under suspicion, for what\r\ncause I knew not, but the picture must be in some way connected with it.\r\nHad the portrait been stolen, and did its possession implicate me in the\r\ntheft? Yet who would care to recover so worthless a thing? Should I destroy\r\nit and thus end the ravel? No, if innocent why should I fear? and was not\r\nthis the only connecting link between me and the brown-eyed girl who\r\nstrangely resembled it?\r\n\r\n\"Come what will, the picture shall be preserved,\" I exclaimed finally.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, my night was restless, and the day following it more so. I\r\nwent about my business distraught, mixing the distinctions between Alencon\r\nand Chantilly, and not having even the poor satisfaction of quarrelling\r\nwith my confidant, who now kept up a moody silence. I was glad when evening\r\ncame that I might be free to think, but evening brought a new complication.\r\n\r\nOn entering the Rue St. Lazare, I saw a person who in the shadow of a\r\nporte-cochere appeared to await me. As I passed him he leaned forward and\r\nplaced in my hand a packet wrapped and rewrapped with twine, whispering,\r\n\"For the cause.\" Then I recognized the shock-headed boy from the\r\nfurniture-shop. I was too much surprised at this to notice, as I should\r\notherwise have done, two men who at this moment seemed to start from the\r\ndarkness and keep near me until I reached my door. There they seized me by\r\nthe arms, and before I could think of resistance had placed me in a cab\r\nstanding in readiness.\r\n\r\nWe drove very quietly along the street until we stopped at what I found to\r\nbe the police head-quarters. I omitted to say that one of my captors had\r\ngrasped my hand holding the packet when he first seized me. This man never\r\nrelaxed his grasp during our ride, nor while descending from the cab, nor\r\nwhile we threaded a long corridor leading to an antechamber; and when we\r\nfinally stood before a person who appeared to be high in authority he still\r\nretained my hand. Thus I had no chance of getting rid of what I feared\r\nmight be my ruin.\r\n\r\n\"Confront the prisoner,\" ordered the high personage briefly.\r\n\r\n\"I am here,\" replied one of my captors, whom I now recognized as the same\r\nindividual to whom I had sold lace two days before.\r\n\r\n\"What is your charge?\"\r\n\r\n\"This man is suspected of being connected with a secret society the\r\nprinciples of which are inimical to the Empire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any proofs?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw him receive a secret communication to-night: it is here.\" With this\r\nhe raised my hand.\r\n\r\n\"Stand forward.\"\r\n\r\nI moved toward the light, while the officer unclosed my fingers, to which I\r\noffered no resistance. There lay the packet enclosed with its many cords.\r\n\r\n\"What does it contain?\" asked the great man.\r\n\r\n\"I have not ventured to touch it,\" answered he at my right obsequiously.\r\n\r\n\"Cut the cords.\"\r\n\r\nThis was done amid profound silence: my anxiety may be imagined as I\r\nawaited the result. There was as much wrapping-paper as string, and when\r\nthe last fold had been carefully undone it revealed--two large sous. I\r\nbreathed more freely.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of blank amazement on the part of the officials, a\r\nwhispered conference, and the paper was held to the light, heated by the\r\nfire, and examined with a glass, without result. The sous were handled in\r\nthe same manner, and finally their date and description were written in a\r\nbook; after which came an order in the same quiet tone that had been used\r\nbefore: \"Search the prisoner.\"\r\n\r\nIn five minutes more all the clothing upon me had been cut into shreds and\r\nminutely examined: even my hat did not escape, and my watch was opened. Of\r\ncourse nothing was found, but that did not alter the fact that my best suit\r\nof clothes was a heap of ruins. My pocket-book was turned inside out, and\r\nmy passport, that I always carry with me, it being often necessary to start\r\non my employers' business at a moment's notice, received a great deal of\r\nattention. At last other clothes nearly identical with those I had lost\r\nwere handed me, and when I donned them I was given a hat; my pocket-book,\r\npassport and watch were returned; and the conductor of ceremonies begged my\r\npardon for the slight (he called it _slight_) trouble he had occasioned me,\r\nsaid he found the suspicions of my accuser unfounded, and ordered him to\r\n\"conduct the gentleman to his residence;\" which was accordingly done.\r\n\r\nWhen there, I could neither read nor sleep, and to escape the tormenting\r\nround of questions and answers that brought no solution to the mystery\r\nsurrounding me, I resolved to spend the evening at the theatre. I went to\r\nthe Francais. It was useless: the dialogue unremittingly kept up between my\r\ntwo selves prevented my hearing that on the stage.\r\n\r\nMy eyes were wandering in dreamy abstraction over the mass of faces partly\r\nturned toward me during the entr'acte, when I was suddenly roused to full\r\nconsciousness by recognizing in one of them the features of my portrait.\r\nThe man was regarding me as if waiting to catch my eye: when he saw by my\r\nstart of surprise that he had succeeded, he made a movement with his lips\r\nand turned away. In a moment he was lost in the crowd.\r\n\r\nMy inner self, who always doubts the evidence of the senses, suggested that\r\nit was a mistake. \"Would this person, even were he the original of the\r\nportrait, know you or make you a sign?\" said he, adding thereto other\r\narguments, which, though I emphatically disbelieved, I was too agitated to\r\ncontradict.\r\n\r\nI tried to remain during the second act, hoping to verify my first\r\nimpression, but after twisting my neck in order to look behind, and\r\nstraining my eyes in front, receiving angry glances and \"'Sh! 'sh!\" from my\r\nneighbors, annoyed by these movements, I concluded to leave.\r\n\r\nClose to the Fountain Moliere I thought I heard footsteps following me:\r\nthere was one pair besides my own in the street. I listened to them for\r\nsome time, and finally they seemed to regulate themselves with mine.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis the police!\" I confided to my other self.\r\n\r\n\"Always fearful,\" was his reply.\r\n\r\n\"You can be very cool: _you_ have no neck in danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am happy to say _my_ ideas need not be influenced by such paltry\r\nconsiderations. In fact, you are a coward!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a fool!\" I returned.\r\n\r\nAt this desperate juncture the quarrel fortunately ended by its object\r\ncoming nearer and in a deep musical voice saying, \"Good-evening, friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-evening,\" I answered gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"You don't appear to know me.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a shabby cap from his head and turned his face: a chill ran through\r\nme when in the dim street-light I recognized my portrait, moving, speaking,\r\nliving. A black patch above the brow made me wonder if the wound it\r\nconcealed passed through the head, as did that in the picture, and his eyes\r\nwere more brilliant and eager than the painted ones, with their pathetic\r\nlook changed to one of defiance, as if a devil had taken possession of\r\nthose beautiful features. For a moment superstition kept me silent, then I\r\nsaid briefly, \"I don't know you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to introduce myself--Favart the International. You are delighted\r\nto make my acquaintance, no doubt. Calm your transports: time does not\r\nadmit of them. We start for Belgium to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who start?\" I asked, now thinking the man a maniac.\r\n\r\n\"I, you, all of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am none of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are suspected of being, which is worse, much worse. Hold! I will\r\nsketch your position accurately. Let us enter this cabaret: it is kept by\r\none of us.\" I followed him mechanically, and when we were seated in a dark\r\ncorner, with some wine he called for before us, he continued: \"I divide the\r\nsketch into three heads, historical, personal and political. There is a\r\ntheory called Socialism--a people called Socialists, or Chartists, or\r\nCommunists: they have different names in different countries. You may have\r\nheard of them in the past: you shall hear more of them in the future. They\r\nhave a good organization and magnificent sympathies.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you called yourself an International.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so. Socialism is the idea, Internationalism is its result. And now\r\nthe historic is mingled with the personal. This society was lately\r\nmeditating a _coup:_ it was necessary to have meetings, and we had to\r\ndevise a signal for rallying. I submitted one to the committee, which was\r\nunanimously adopted as simple yet efficient. My portrait--I was not then\r\nsufficiently known to make it suspicious--was to stand outside the door of\r\nthe shop where you found it on the days when a meeting would be held. The\r\nold furniture-dealer is one of us: so is the concierge of No. 42 Notre Dame\r\nde Lorette. About a week ago the former came to me in distress, saying the\r\nportrait had been sold in his absence: he did not even know to whom. I told\r\nhim it must be recovered at all hazards, as it would cause great\r\ninconvenience and loss of time to fix on another signal. The next day you\r\nwere supposed to have it through the inquiries you made at No. 42, where\r\nyou frightened the concierge nearly out of his wits, he taking you for a\r\nspy. He immediately informed his friend the furniture-dealer that the\r\npolice were on our track, and when told of the sale of the picture said you\r\nmust have it. However, they did not dare bring mere conjectures to me: they\r\nwatched and waited. On the third day after you passed the shop: the dealer\r\nknew you through the concierge's description, inveigled you in, and easily\r\nobtained the information he wanted about the picture, but failed to gain\r\npossession of it. Then Sidonia took the matter in hand--Sidonia always\r\nhelps us out of a difficulty--but her attempts also failed, though she\r\ndiscovered not only that you were no spy, but that you were yourself under\r\nsuspicion. The police were following us closely: they had found out the use\r\nwe made of the portrait, which rendered its recovery profitless to us. I\r\nresolved to drop both you and it. Shortly after I perceived that it would\r\nbe necessary for us to leave the city, and you being implicated, Sidonia\r\ninsisted on my warning you before we went, though, as you do not belong to\r\nus, I could see no use in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, then, it was not the dealer's boy who informed on me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: he gave a description calculated to mislead. I believe he has by\r\nlistening gained some half truths, and thinks _you_ are an International:\r\nit was for that cause he gave you the packet which brought you into trouble\r\nthis evening. Ha! ha! ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know I have been in trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Through one of our spies in the police service: he was present at your\r\nexamination, and was detailed to watch you to-night. He told me of your\r\nbeing at the theatre; hence my opportunity of speaking to you. I can say no\r\nmore: the political part of my sketch you have had a specimen of at the\r\npolice-station to-night; if you stay you are likely to see more. Believe\r\nme, they only liberated you so politely in order, by watching you, to find\r\nyour companions. To-morrow, after we are gone, there will be discoveries\r\nmade through this same agent of ours in their employ. As they are already\r\non our track, we take this method to gain their confidence for our man. If\r\nyou fancy another examination by the police, remain.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am innocent!\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, you are. You know absolutely nothing with which to buy your\r\nliberty. What I have told you will be of no service: it will be already\r\ntheirs. If you wish to go to Belgium ask at No. 33 Rue Lafitte for a\r\ntravelling suit: you will receive one like mine.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked down at his heavy shoes, soiled overalls and tattered blouse,\r\nthen touching the latter with his fingers, continued: \"I use it now for a\r\ndisguise, but the day will come when this blouse will be our standard--the\r\nlaborer shall possess the earth. He who works shall live, and idleness,\r\nwith the riches that foster it, will end. Necessities shall be plenty and\r\nluxuries unattainable. Palaces shall fall to give material for poor men's\r\ndwellings; monuments that glorify one man at the expense of his brothers\r\nmust disappear; and churches, promises of another world, can no longer\r\ntrick us out of our share, our birthright, in this. Paris will arise a new\r\nand better Sparta. Sparta, great mother of communes! I salute you!\r\nLeonidas! Favart aspires to eclipse your glory! Not for one nation does he\r\nlabor, but for humanity--for the workers of the world, whose rightful dues\r\nare filched from them by the drones. Nature resents this wrong: the drones\r\nmust die.\"\r\n\r\nHe had risen as he pronounced these words, low but rapidly: a moment he\r\nstood before me, his face glowing, his hand clenched, then his expression\r\nrapidly changed, and he said briefly, \"It is a time for action, not for\r\nwords. Good-night!\"\r\n\r\nA conflagration, an electric spark, was this shabby man, and I could easily\r\nbelieve what I afterward heard of his influence with the people.\r\n\r\nHe left me with my mind more perplexed than ever. What had been the _coup_\r\nthese people were meditating, in which I, in the eyes of the police, was\r\nimplicated? Murder? Treason? Arson? Nothing was beyond them with their\r\nmagnificent sympathies. Perhaps this might be my only chance of escape;\r\nyet in doing so did I not cast my lot with theirs? should I not make myself\r\ndoubly suspected? Embarrassing questions, to which neither self was ready\r\nwith an answer. There was the prospect, too, of losing my situation if I\r\nremained long away, but in opposition to this practical consideration was\r\nthe remembrance of my air-bath and the doubt about my future if I remained.\r\nIn this chaos of thought can you guess what decided me? It was Favart's\r\nwords: \"We are all going.\" Did not _we_ include her whom he called Sidonia,\r\nwho had visited my room and had insisted I should be warned? Yes.\r\n\r\nNot in disguise: I was in no humor to complicate the situation. Having my\r\npassport in my pocket, and knowing the policeman who was watching me would\r\nnot prevent my flight, I simply walked to the station and took a\r\nfirst-class ticket to Brussels. First class, for I knew the man in the\r\nblouse must travel third, and I was anxious to be as far from him as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nI reached the frontier in safety. My examination ended, the officer turned\r\nto my only travelling companion, a lady who up to this time appeared to\r\nhave been sleeping. As he threw the light of his lantern into her face I\r\nalso looked at her. Good Heavens! could I be mistaken? The hair, it is\r\ntrue, was blond, and the dress a robe of deep mourning, but the eyes were\r\nthe eyes of my portrait, the eyes of Favart, the eyes of my pretty\r\nwasherwoman--Sidonia! The ordeal passed, the door shut, the train moved on.\r\n\r\n\"Have I your permission to speak, mademoiselle?\" I asked in an agitated\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"If you wish, monsieur.\" She turned toward me a sad, tear-stained face that\r\nwell suited her mourning.\r\n\r\n\"You are suffering: you have been weeping. Has anything occurred? Why this\r\ndress?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing has occurred _yet_,\" she answered, trying to smile. \"The danger\r\nfor my brother is over once more. This dress is simply a disguise. God\r\ngrant I may not soon be wearing it in token of sorrow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Favart your brother?\" I asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my only one. I cannot bear to lose him. And you too have become\r\nimplicated: it seemed as if Fate led you on.\"\r\n\r\nI did not dare tell her how I felt that any fate was blessed that brought\r\nme to know her, to see her again. The thrill I experienced at this\r\nunexpected meeting revealed to me the strength of my feelings.\r\n\r\n\"In a few days I think matters will be arranged so that you can return to\r\nParis,\" she went on, \"but I thought it best for you to be absent at first.\r\nI hope it will not put you to inconvenience. What do you do?\"\r\n\r\nI told her my employment, not without wishing it was higher, but she said\r\nsweetly, \"I am glad you are a working-man: your hands are so white I feared\r\nyou were an idler.\"\r\n\r\n\"You endorse your brother's principles, mademoiselle? You too are a\r\nSocialist?\"\r\n\r\n\"I honor labor--any and all kinds of labor. They say they admire it, but do\r\nthey work? Ah no! Once my Charles was different. We come of laboring\r\npeople. Our father owned a few fields, which we cultivated ourselves. I\r\nkept the dairy and assisted in harvest and at the vintage. Those were happy\r\ndays. The good cure taught us to read and write, and lent my brother books,\r\nbut Charles has forgotten his kindness. He was discontented even then, and\r\nwould throw stones at the park-wall that surrounded the chateau near our\r\nproperty, and scowl at the little marquises as they passed us on horseback\r\nwhen we were afoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you come to Paris?\" I asked, seeing that in her present state of\r\nexcitement speaking relieved her.\r\n\r\n\"Our parents died: my brother had a taste for painting, and wished to go to\r\nParis and study. Monsieur le cure had given him some lessons and was proud\r\nof his talent: he counselled me to accompany Charles, and came with us to\r\nget me a place in a shop and recommend Charles to an artist of his\r\nacquaintance; and yet Charles says the cures are not our friends! The rent\r\nof our fields, with what I received, supported us. We had two little rooms\r\nand lived together, Charles and I. He made such rapid progress! The\r\nportrait you bought he painted at my request in the evening, while I sewed\r\nbeside him. We were so happy. O mon Dieu! why could it not have lasted?\"\r\n\r\nShe covered her face with her hands and burst into tears, but only for a\r\nmoment: before I could think what to say to comfort her she was again\r\nspeaking: \"I do not often weep, but this dress depresses me: it is\r\nill-omened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not think so: you are tired, over-wrought, to-night. The danger is\r\npast, and maybe you can persuade your brother to return to his art, and\r\nhappier days will come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! When he first joined the society I tried in vain. Now he\r\nbelongs to it heart and soul. He has set an example of communism by selling\r\nour land and giving the proceeds to the cause, and he now lives on\r\ncontributions, which he is not ashamed to take, because he believes that\r\nwhat the earth produces is common to all, and he only receives his rightful\r\nshare.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you also belong--is it not so?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I found he would not return I followed: we could not be separated.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you share all his danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"All,\" she answered firmly. \"Danger shared is lessened, you know. Where he\r\nis, I am. But I wished to speak of your affairs. I forgot myself: sorrow is\r\nselfish. You must write to your employers and give some explanation of your\r\nabsence: in a week at furthest I trust you will be able to return without\r\nannoyance. I will see that information which will exculpate you is given to\r\nthe authorities. And, as far as my brother and myself are concerned, I know\r\nfrom your face I can trust you.\"\r\n\r\nI would sooner have had my homely features at that moment than those of\r\nApollo. When I arrived in Brussels I wrote to my employers, as she\r\nrequested, but after excusing my sudden departure I begged them to\r\nrecommend me to some firm in that city, for I resolved not to leave until I\r\nhad offered Sidonia the protection of a husband. The answer to my letter\r\nwas most favorable. I had the pleasure of showing it to Sidonia and telling\r\nher my plans, from which she tried to dissuade me with all the eloquence in\r\nher power.\r\n\r\n\"We are dangerous acquaintance, dangerous friends and dangerous enemies.\r\nThe sooner we fade from your life the better,\" she said; but I would not\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\nThe happiest month of my life I spent in Brussels. I found employment: I\r\nsaw Sidonia every day, and if possible admired her hourly more. She had a\r\nquick judgment, born of the experience she had gained through the part she\r\ntook in her brother's affairs. She knew whom to trust, and I am happy to\r\nsay she trusted me; but, though frank, I never again saw the manner she had\r\nadopted when she came to my room: inclining naturally to be gay, she was\r\nalways dignified. Once I ventured to apologize for the way I had spoken to\r\nher during that visit.\r\n\r\n\"My behavior gave rise to it,\" she answered. \"I was obliged to act a part.\r\nBut you gentlemen should have more respect for those poor girls whose daily\r\nwants often expose them to insult.\"\r\n\r\n\"After a man loves one good woman he learns to respect all women for her\r\nsake. You have taught me that lesson.\"\r\n\r\nShe taught me much more, my wise, my sensible Sidonia. With the example of\r\nher busy hands and the advocacy of her sweet lips my second self was\r\nbrought to recognize the beauty and nobility of honest toil. Favart's life\r\nafforded an illustration of how the most exalted opinions can lead a man\r\nastray; and he humbly confessed that had my course been modelled according\r\nto his views, I should not now be able to offer Sidonia a home, which he\r\nheartily approved of my doing. I in turn acknowledged that I owed much in\r\nthe estimation of my darling to his cultivation. I saw that she respected\r\nhis acquirements, and that his longest conversations were agreeable to her;\r\nwhile had I been left with only the merits of lace to expatiate upon I\r\nshould have failed to please.\r\n\r\nBut with my love my fears for her increased. Favart was seldom at home--now\r\nin England, now in Germany, now in Italy. What new scheme was he\r\nmeditating? what new danger was he recklessly preparing for his sister?\r\nTormented by misgivings, I resolved to make an effort to turn him from his\r\ncourse, and, failing in that, to gain his consent to a speedy marriage\r\nbetween me and Sidonia. Knowing his egotism, I approached him with a\r\ncompliment: \"Sidonia tells me you are the painter of the portrait that\r\nbrought me into trouble: from its merit I should venture to predict great\r\nthings of your future.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your prediction is likely to be fulfilled, but my fame will rest on\r\nsomething more profitable to humanity than painting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you never intend to paint again?\" I ventured.\r\n\r\n\"Never: my time is employed in nobler work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you ever think of the danger you incur? do you ever count the suffering\r\nto others you may cause in attaining your object?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think of success!\" As he said these words the devil in his eyes flashed\r\na triumphant glance, and I noticed for the first time the change for the\r\nworse that a few weeks had made in him. His face was haggard, his movements\r\nwere restless: a life of constant excitement was telling on mind and body.\r\n\r\n\"And your sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is worthy of me. With a mind fertile in resources she has an undaunted\r\ncourage: we could not do without her. Twice she has saved my life, and once\r\nher address turned away the police from a meeting where there would have\r\nbeen at least twenty of our leading men arrested had they found us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you never think of the danger she is exposed to? You never realize\r\nwhat an improper, what a cruel position it is in which to place a young and\r\nbeautiful girl--you who are her natural protector? Listen to me, I beseech\r\nyou: leave this life before it is too late; spare yourself, spare her;\r\nreturn to the ambition that made you happy before this frenzy seized you.\r\nI know now of some lace designs you could get to make: it would be a\r\nbeginning, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Lace designs!\" he interrupted, contemptuously. \"He seeks to bind a man's\r\nambition with _lace_! he would stifle the breath of purpose with _lace_! he\r\nwould swaddle a sublime project in _lace_, until it is as weak as his own\r\ncourage, as petty as his own soul! The noble idea!\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it is nobler to live on contributions,\" I answered hotly.\r\n\r\n\"I take but my own. Nature provides enough for all if we behave as children\r\nof one parent and divide her bounty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Live as you please, run what risks you like, but spare your sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, give her to you,\" he sneered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, give her to me. I love her: _my_ ambition will be to protect her. I\r\nask for none better. And surely if you are not utterly selfish, when in\r\nperil you will be glad to know of her safety. Give her to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never! never! never! I waste time in talking to you. Your understanding is\r\nless even than I thought, but if Sidonia likes to have a tame cat about to\r\namuse her leisure, I have no objections. As for a marriage with you,\r\nneither she nor I would think of it.\" So saying, with his usual abrupt\r\nmanner he left me.\r\n\r\nI made a passionate appeal to Sidonia. \"Be my wife and leave the\r\nInternationals,\" I said. \"What is the use of your sacrificing yourself for\r\nprinciples in which you do not believe? It is true, I can only offer you\r\nsafety and love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Safety?\" she repeated sadly. \"Could it include my brother I would ask\r\nHeaven for no other blessing.\"\r\n\r\nI begged, I pleaded, I argued, but to all she answered, \"Who will save him\r\nif I am absent?\"\r\n\r\nI was obliged to wait and hope.\r\n\r\nNow came the war, when disaster followed disaster until the Germans had\r\ncompleted the investment of Paris: then she begged me to go.\r\n\r\n\"Your country needs you: join the army of the Loire and do what you can to\r\nhelp it. You have been with us too long: already it would be difficult to\r\nmake people believe that you do not belong to us. But if you serve\r\nsuspicion will be averted. For my sake, go!\"\r\n\r\n\"For your sake I stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken: if I need your protection you will be in a better\r\nposition to give it by going than by staying.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you need my protection, will you let me give it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"The protection of my name, the protection of a husband?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the protection of a husband.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an invention of her goodness, my darling! Knowing the monstrous plot\r\nthe Socialists were meditating, she wished me to be absent. And I went,\r\nregretting only our present separation and fearing nothing for the future.\r\n\r\nI was defeated with Motterouge, and afterward fought with D'Aurelle and\r\nChanzy until hostilities ceased. On the third of March Paris was evacuated\r\nby the Germans, and fifteen days after followed the revolt of the Commune.\r\nHeaven only knows how I suffered during that time. I would have given my\r\nlife to know she was safe: I would have risked it by deserting could I have\r\nhoped to find and protect her. But had she not said, \"Where he is, I am\"?\r\nand would not Favart be in the thickest of the fight? Oh cruel necessity!\r\nMy best chance of meeting her was at the point of the bayonet with the\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nFort Valerien was taken: we entered Paris, and like a living web encircled\r\nthe insurgents. Step by step they retreated, step by step we followed: we\r\ncould not miss the way; ruin and blood marked their path.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth of May but one barricade remained standing. I was in\r\nthe front rank when the order was given to charge on it, and amid smoke and\r\nnoise and the glare of burning buildings we obeyed. There I saw Favart:\r\nalmost face to face we met. His eyes the color of blood and starting from\r\nhis head, his nostrils distended, his face livid, his hair and moustache\r\nbristling with rage, his hoarse voice shouting commands, he stood\r\nindifferent to danger, fighting like a wild beast, furious as a madman. A\r\nmoment, and then, a bullet entering his forehead, he fell, and a woman's\r\nshriek rang on the air.\r\n\r\nOh for the strength of a thousand men! oh for wings! oh for power! Might my\r\nwhole life be contained in that moment could I but save her! Suddenly the\r\nstreet, the barricade, the houses on either side, trembled, heaved and\r\nleapt into the air. A tremendous explosion, with flame and debris, forced\r\nwhat remained of us to retreat--forced also the poor remnant of our enemy\r\nto surrender. A cordon was formed around the quarter, so that none escaped.\r\nWounded, blackened, bleeding, torn, they crawled by, and she was among\r\nthem, my darling, my angel--among those shameless women, those hardened\r\nmen!\r\n\r\nI could not save her, tried, convicted and sentenced at Versailles, my\r\nbeautiful, innocent Sidonia. I wrote letters; my perseverance gained me\r\nadmission to the highest authorities; I prayed, I wept, I pleaded, but the\r\nname of Favart closed every avenue to pity. The most active, the most\r\ncruel, the most merciless in the Commune, foremost in destruction,\r\nindefatigable in barbarity, her brother, the shadow of her life, was the\r\ncause of her death.\r\n\r\nI heard the sentence pronounced, \"Transportation for life:\" it did not seem\r\nto move her. Wan, her once neat dress in disorder, a shadow of her former\r\nself, she sat immovable. Once I met her eye, but she did not recognize me:\r\nonly when the wind accidentally blew back the torn sleeve from her white\r\narm I saw a moment's consciousness, and she blushed as she replaced it.\r\nHaply, she was deaf to the cries of \"Petroleuse!\" and shouts of imprecation\r\nthat met her as she was taken through the crowd; but what fearful suffering\r\nmust that sensitive mind have endured before its faculties were thus\r\nbenumbed!\r\n\r\nI gained one slight concession: I was permitted to write one letter to her\r\nbefore she was sent away. I begged her not to lose hope that after the\r\nfirst excitement was over I might gain for her a commutation of the\r\nsentence--to have courage and trust me. I received no answer. I do not even\r\nknow if her condition permitted her to receive one ray of comfort from my\r\nlove: I only know she died. She never reached Cayenne. The transport-ship\r\nwas her deathbed, and the ocean my martyr's grave.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot die. Memory, the portrait, and I live together--the portrait\r\nat once recalling the angel, the devil, the joy, the sorrow of my life. Yet\r\nlet me not curse him: he was her brother, and she loved him.

R. CHAMPLIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAYS OF MY YOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life depicted in the Waverley novels seems to me scarcely more remote\r\nthan that in Virginia before the war. As is well known, the land, the\r\nwealth, the influence, the education were possessed by comparatively few\r\nfamilies; and I think there has never been so much happiness enjoyed by any\r\nother community or class of people in this country as those families\r\nenjoyed for generations. Whatever may be said of their social system--and I\r\nam aware that it was not the best--it was perfect of its kind. From their\r\npoint of view, everything was as it should be, always excepting the acts of\r\none or the other party in politics. Life was made easy, and such exacting\r\ncares and responsibilities as could not be honorably evaded were met\r\nwithout friction, without struggle, without question. Beyond the observance\r\nof a few perfectly-defined habits and customs we did not feel it necessary\r\nto wander in search of social law. What a vast amount of the worry that\r\nperplexes too many other people we escaped! What does the world think? what\r\nwill people say? whom shall we recognize? how do we appear?--such\r\nquestions, that bring so many of my sex to premature gray hairs, disturbed\r\nus not. If one's standing was what it should be, all Virginia knew it; and\r\nthat was the end of it. If one's standing was not what it should be, all\r\nVirginia knew that; and there, again, was the end of it. It is not easy for\r\nladies reared under less settled conditions to realize how much this\r\nheritage meant to us. We loved our time-honored pleasures; we loved our\r\nfriends; we loved the old homes and old ways in which our ancestors,\r\nundisturbed by the restlessness of the North and West, had lived and died\r\nbefore us; we loved our State.\r\n\r\nTo voluntarily put all this behind me after the meridian of life was\r\npassed; to take poverty for my companion and go forth into a world I had\r\nnever seen; to send an only son to fight against the traditions, the\r\nkindred, the State that were so dear,--what this cost may Heaven spare the\r\nwomen of the North from ever knowing! _They_ could hope and pray for the\r\npreservation of what they cherished and for the destruction of what they\r\ncondemned. But the Southern woman who was loyal, view it as she would,\r\ncould but hope and pray for the destruction of what she loved. Looking back\r\nnow on those dreadful days, sorrowing for the sad necessities of the case,\r\nI can but thank God for the fortitude and insight with which He then\r\nendowed me, for the result that at length justified my trust, and put away\r\nall other recollections of the later time as something too painful to dwell\r\nupon even in thought. The Virginia that shall live in my memory is one that\r\nis gone for ever.\r\n\r\nLiving as we did on a spur of the Blue Ridge, in the most salubrious part\r\nof the State, one would have thought there was no necessity for going\r\nelsewhere during the hot months. But my mother, near half a century ago,\r\nthought differently. About the first of July we always started on what I\r\nused to call, when a girl, our \"pilgrimage.\" In an old-fashioned coach,\r\nround as an apple and lifted high in the air--which in my childish fancy\r\nwas ever associated with the one the fairy made from Cinderella's\r\npumpkin--with a fat old coachman, and horses as fat and lazy as he, we\r\nwould make the distance of twenty miles a day. We accomplished about half\r\nthis in the cool morning, stopping at some country tavern during the heat\r\nof the day, and driving another ten miles amid the shades of evening.\r\nBehind us, at a respectful distance, trundled our baggage-wagon. We had\r\nrelations in every county, as all true Virginians were bound to have; and\r\nwe would tarry for days with them on our journeys, with as little regard to\r\nreaching a definite place at a definite time as if a thousand years\r\nremained to us.\r\n\r\nOne of these summer jaunts, when I was a girl, on which I first saw Mr.\r\nMadison, is particularly impressed on my memory. We sojourned several days\r\nat his lovely seat, Montpelier, Mrs. Madison being an old friend of my\r\nmother's. The venerable ex-President was then much emaciated, and I thought\r\nwas failing rapidly. He lay most of the time on a couch in the middle of\r\nthe room adjoining the dining-room, wrapped in a black silk dressing-gown\r\nelaborately quilted, and did not look larger than a boy of thirteen. At\r\ndinner the first day I was attacked by ague, and Mrs. Madison, leading me\r\ninto the next room, placed me on his couch. I awoke an hour or two after in\r\na high fever, and the look of his face which has outlived all others in my\r\nrecollection is that of amusement which lighted the wan features on\r\nbeholding the expression of bewilderment and confusion which overspread\r\nmine as I opened my eyes, half delirious, and found him lying beside me.\r\n\r\nIn her long talks with us on this occasion Mrs. Madison told many incidents\r\nof her life in Philadelphia and Washington. The two following are in her\r\nown words, as nearly as I can repeat them: \"One day in Philadelphia,\" she\r\nsaid, \"I was sitting in my parlor with a very dear friend, Mrs. R. B. Lee,\r\nwhen in walked Payne Todd [her son] dressed in my calico bed-gown. While we\r\nwere laughing at the figure he cut, the servant threw open the door and\r\nannounced General and Mrs. Washington. What to do with that dreadful boy I\r\ndidn't know. He could not face the President in that garb. Neither could he\r\nleave the room without meeting them, for the door they were entering was\r\nthe only one. I made him crawl quickly under a low, broad settee on which I\r\nwas sitting. I had just time to arrange the drapery when the Washingtons\r\nentered. After the courtly greeting and the usual compliments of the\r\nseason, there came from under the settee a heavy sigh, which evidently\r\nattracted the general's notice. However, I only talked and laughed a little\r\nlouder, hoping to divert his attention, when--oh me!--there came an outcry\r\nand a kick that could not be ignored. So I stooped down and dragged Payne\r\nout by the leg. General Washington's dignity left him for once. Laugh? why\r\nhe fairly roared! He nearly went into convulsions. The sight of that boy in\r\nthat gown, all so unexpected, coming wrong end first from under my\r\nseat,--it was too much.\"\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Madison would in private sometimes romp and tease each other\r\nlike two children, and engage in antics that would astonish the muse of\r\nHistory. Mrs. Madison was stronger as well as larger than he. She\r\ncould--and did--seize his hands, draw him upon her back and go round the\r\nroom with him whenever she particularly wished to impress him with a due\r\nsense of man's inferiority. Speaking of their flight from Washington on the\r\n24th of August, 1814, she said: \"After Mr. Madison had left the White House\r\nfor Fairfax, I busied myself in gathering up the little things I prized and\r\npacking them in the carriage, which stood ready at the door. I had placed a\r\nservant at the gate to warn me of the approach of the English troops. I had\r\njust left the sitting-room with a cup and saucer which had belonged to\r\nMarie Antoinette when in rushed my sentinel. After securing the portrait of\r\nWashington, and getting that into the carriage, I jumped in myself, and\r\naway we went for the Chain Bridge. I was dreadfully frightened, and\r\nexpected to be pursued. We drove as fast as we could without breaking the\r\ncarriage to pieces. I looked out of the back window, thinking I might see\r\nwhat was going on in Washington; and, sure enough, to my horror there was a\r\nBritish officer galloping after us at full speed, followed by some\r\nsoldiers. I was so alarmed that I opened the door and sprang into the road.\r\nI had no bonnet--only a purple turban--on my head, and my face, I knew, was\r\nred as a poppy. In my excitement I thought I could run faster than the\r\ncarriage. The officer passed me, wheeled suddenly, bowed low, and asked me\r\nif he saw Mrs. Madison, the President's lady, at the same time placing his\r\nhand in the bosom of his coat. I inclined my head, expecting that he would\r\ndraw forth nothing less than a pistol. But it was a package instead of a\r\npistol that he offered, saying, 'I was requested to place this in your\r\nhands by Lady ---- of England, and finding you had just left your\r\nresidence, I questioned your servants and took the liberty of following\r\nyou.' He turned with a low bow, and was gone, leaving me overwhelmed with\r\nmortification.\"\r\n\r\nThe seat that inspired _Swallow Barn_ was the home of my aunt. John P.\r\nKennedy was her nephew and my cousin. In its main features the book is\r\nsingularly true, as an artist would say, in its effects. The prominent\r\ncharacter of Mr. Tracy is almost a literal portrait. To me, so familiar\r\nwith the real scenes, there seemed an appearance of rather too much\r\nrestraint, as if the conscientious author felt too constantly the fear that\r\nhis hand, gentle as it was, might transgress the laws of hospitality and\r\ndecorum. This feeling on my part arose, no doubt, from the single fact that\r\nI did know the reality, and thus knew many episodes that would have made\r\nthe sketches richer to us giddy young people of that jolly household, but\r\nwhich did not commend themselves to the practised writer. He took pains to\r\nplace Swallow Barn on the lower James. But it was west of the Blue Ridge,\r\nin Jefferson county. The mother of Kennedy was a very beautiful and highly\r\naccomplished woman. She was known among her friends as \"Kennedy's angel.\"\r\nShe excelled particularly in music, always tuning her piano herself, and\r\ngiving her preference to the works of Mozart. Here at her sister's, Mrs.\r\nDandridge's--at \"Swallow Barn,\" as we may now call it--she and Kennedy's\r\nfather passed their later years, and here many of Cousin John's happiest\r\ndays were spent. He always retained his boyish love of fun. He and\r\nWashington Irving would come up to the old place together, and then beware!\r\nNo one escaped their mischief. They spared neither age, sex nor previous\r\ncondition. Such pranks, such absurdities, such good-natured deviltry, as\r\nreigned supreme till they were gone! During harvest they would take their\r\nseats under the trees with the hands at the long dinner-tables, and\r\nassiduously bottle up quaint sayings and odd doings for future use.\r\n\r\nOne adventure in particular, which I think is not alluded to in _Swallow\r\nBarn_, should have formed a chapter there. Kennedy himself was the\r\nringleader, and his wife's father the victim. The old gentleman was\r\nexpected to arrive on a certain day, as a visitor, from Baltimore. It was\r\nnot long after Nat Turner's insurrection, and he had conceived an\r\nexaggerated idea of the affair. He was a little timid, in consequence,\r\nabout travelling into Virginia alone at that particular time. John knew\r\nthat his father-in-law was decidedly \"nervous\" on the subject. So he, with\r\nwhat we used to call \"the clan,\" the endless line or circle of\r\ncousins--Dandridges, Kennedys, Pendletons--blacked their faces, clothed\r\nthemselves like plantation hands, carrying old muskets, spades and forks,\r\nwith cocks' feathers in the hats of the leaders, and marched to meet their\r\nprey. When \"attacked\" by the gang, the old gentleman gave himself up for\r\nlost. They surrounded his carriage, but before dragging him forth to his\r\ndoom they began delivering to him the most preposterous harangue; which,\r\nnotwithstanding his fright, led him to detect a son-in-law under the\r\ndisguise of the principal desperado. Anger was useless with such a party,\r\nand by the time he reached the house his prayers for mercy had changed to\r\nlaughter. Prominent in \"the clan\" and its diversions in those days was\r\nColonel Strother, subsequently \"Porte Crayon:\" \"Cousin Dave\" was his title\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nWhen Hon. Charles J. Faulkner was married he was keeping bachelor's hall,\r\nand it was proposed that he should give his bride a breakfast the next\r\nmorning. Kennedy was the master spirit in the arrangements. The table was\r\ncovered with a cloth that was far from immaculate, and set with broken,\r\ncracked and odd pieces of china. The viands were bacon, corn-bread, etc.,\r\narranged in the most grotesque manner possible. When the bridal-party were\r\nushered in, profoundly ignorant of the joke, they stood horror-stricken.\r\nKennedy, solemn as an owl, clad as a butler and with white apron, advanced\r\nand presented to the bride about a peck of great rusty keys strung on a\r\nchain that might have drawn a plough, the whole so heavy she could not lift\r\nthem. And the speech in which he presented them! Any attempt to repeat or\r\ndescribe its drollery would only spoil it. I believe he never wrote\r\nanything so witty, so inimitably funny. He wound up by saying that he\r\nresigned, with tears in his eyes--which were tears of laughter--all\r\nauthority and control over the establishment. When the farce was played out\r\nthere was another announcement, and then a breakfast fit for the gods was\r\nserved in earnest.\r\n\r\nJohn P. Kennedy had no children, but was passionately fond of the children\r\nof his relations, especially those of his brothers, who in turn almost\r\nworshipped him. Making all allowances, of course, for the differences in\r\ntheir surroundings, the geographical difference in their homes, it always\r\nseemed to me that there was an interesting resemblance between him and\r\nIrving in many little things that the world could scarcely know. In what\r\nthey have written the similarity of their humor and style must be apparent\r\nto every one, and Kennedy's literary character was fashioned very much, I\r\nthink, by the influence of his more famous friend's. When quite a young man\r\nKennedy edited, with some kindred spirits, a kind of Salmagundi paper in\r\nBaltimore, ridiculing most effectively a certain class of people whose\r\npretensions so far exceeded their social worth as to make them legitimate\r\ngame for his shafts. It was called _The Red Letter_. Many suspected, but\r\nnone of the victims knew, who were the writers. Some amusing incidents grew\r\nout of it, the aforesaid victims being afraid to invite the aforesaid\r\nkindred spirits to their parties, but still more afraid not to invite them.\r\nLest some reader should have a doubt about the attitude of this genial,\r\ngentle and true man on one important public question, let me add that one\r\nof the last things I knew of his doing was to induce Sheridan to send an\r\nescort of cavalry through to Martinsburg to bring out a young girl whose\r\nparents were Unionists and were then cut off by Southern troops, taking her\r\nto his house and educating her as if she had been his daughter. The last\r\ntime I saw his friend Irving was when Kennedy was retiring from the\r\nSecretaryship of the Navy. The new administration had come in, and the\r\nmembers of the old cabinet were very busy in closing up and turning over\r\ntheir portfolios and arranging their personal affairs for departure. The\r\ndomestic concerns of the retiring Secretary, whose guest Irving had been\r\nduring the winter, were therefore in the same state of upheaval as were\r\naffairs at the department. I called to take leave of the family, but not a\r\nsoul was in the house except Irving. I inquired lightly how he would\r\ndispose of himself in the general break-up, \"Well,\" answered the quizzical\r\nold bachelor with mock plaintiveness, \"I suppose Mrs. Kennedy will pack me\r\nup with the rest of the old crockery.\"\r\n\r\nAmerican country-life can hardly again be so picturesque as it was on some\r\nof the plantations of Virginia in my young days. The cavalcades of huntsmen\r\nreturning with a fox-brush in the cap of the foremost rider, or counting\r\ntheir partridges on the porch before the ladies--partridges being the birds\r\nknown as quails in the North; the riding in the great carriage to church,\r\nsurrounded by a retinue on horseback; the coming and going of company to\r\nspend the day, which meant from noon till twilight; the gathering of the\r\nrose-leaves to be dried and sprinkled over the table- and bed-linen for the\r\nodor they imparted;--an atmosphere whose charm cannot be reproduced\r\nenvelopes these scenes of the far-away past.\r\n\r\nThe chief agricultural event of the year in the region where I lived was\r\nthe harvesting of the grain. All the laboring white men who could be of\r\nservice were employed with the slaves at such times. Their dinners were\r\neaten at long tables under the trees, with a tub of iced toddy or\r\nmint-julep in the shade near by. Supper, when the day's work was done,\r\nbrought hot coffee, rolls and biscuits, and a dance on the grass to the\r\nmusic of fiddle and banjo closed the scene at bedtime. The long lines of\r\n\"cradlers,\" following their leader and laying the golden swaths smoothly\r\nacross hill and valley, were a sight which was lost with keen regret by me.\r\nI shall never forget when the first reaping-machine came clattering into\r\nthe wheat-fields, sounding the knell of all that was most pleasing in the\r\nharvest-time. What a commotion that first reaper made! A certain\r\ndistinguished Senator of the United States--I think he was then Speaker of\r\nthe House--came from afar to witness its operations and to consider its\r\nintroduction on his own rather unproductive plantation. After silently\r\ntaking in its movements, his hands meditatively in his pockets and his chin\r\nburied solemnly in his neckcloth, he turned away in disgust, with a comment\r\nthat was brief and to the point: \"Wouldn't have such a d----d _fast_ thing\r\non my place!\" Much of the distrust, however, with which improved utensils\r\nwere regarded had a better reason. Complicated and delicate machines in the\r\nhands of plantation negroes were too much like \"all the modern\r\nimprovements\" in the terrible hands of Biddy.\r\n\r\nI saw personally but little of the darker side of slavery. The worst\r\npictures I could draw from my own personal knowledge would not be\r\nsufficiently hideous to be interesting. The fairest I could draw would be\r\nof my old black \"mammy.\" From my infancy she was the comforter, counsellor\r\nand guide whose sympathy and assistance never failed me. As dignified as a\r\nduchess; as neat in her striped, home-made dress, kerchief and turban as it\r\nwas possible for mortal to be; jealous of the honor of the family; serene,\r\naffectionate, proud of her usefulness,--she is among the first from whom I\r\nexpect a loving welcome in heaven. My father gave her free papers after she\r\nhad nursed a sick member of the family with especial faithfulness on one\r\noccasion. She locked them up in her trunk, and that was the end of them,\r\nexcept when she took them out to show to her friends. I think it gratified\r\nher to receive them, however. I recollect the incredulity of a good lady\r\nfrom Boston, who asked her if she would not like to live there, where there\r\nwere no masters and mistresses. \"No indeed, honey!\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nWhen a girl I passed a winter in the White House. It was during the last\r\nterm of General Jackson. That high white head; the perpendicular hair; the\r\nclear blue eyes--one moment melting with a woman's tenderness, the next\r\nblazing like an angry lion's--peering earnestly from under the great shaggy\r\neyebrows and over the top of the silver spectacles; the furrowed, pained\r\nface, worn with suffering and perpetual warfare, but occasionally lighted\r\nby a sudden gleam of the old fire, which nothing but death could quench,\r\nwhen his cane would come down with a thump and \"By the Eternal!\" would\r\nbreak forth--the nearest approach to profanity ever heard from his lips by\r\nme, or by anybody, I think, at that period of his life,--how vividly all\r\nthese come back! I saw him at his best. The storms of life had wellnigh\r\npassed. His beloved wife was beckoning him to a world of rest and peace. He\r\nwas the idol of a majority of his countrymen. He occupied a second time, in\r\nobedience to their voices, what he regarded as the most honorable position\r\nthat any man could hold on earth--the Presidency of the United States. In\r\npursuing what he took to be right he had conquered everybody and everything\r\nthat opposed him. He had ever been the incarnation of chivalry toward\r\nwomen. It is natural, therefore, that under all these circumstances, in\r\nthose last days of his and first days of mine, he should have appeared to\r\nme a higher type of man than many people would judge him to be from a\r\nstrictly dispassionate consideration of his whole life. I was never given\r\nto hero-worship, but at that time I did come near worshipping this old\r\nhero. I am not here questioning the justice of his latest and completest\r\nbiography--Mr. Parton's--but would simply remark how difficult it is for\r\nme, seeing him as I did, and only so, to realize that he was the same being\r\nwho enlivens some of the earlier scenes of that book. Toward the women he\r\nrespected--and there hardly seemed to be one whom he did not respect--he\r\nhad a courtliness of bearing, a considerateness, a gentleness, a\r\nnobility--in short, a charm of manner--which made him, as a mere \"carpet\r\nknight,\" the most winning old _gentleman_ I ever knew.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the superstitions of the Scotch-Irish, Mr. Parton says:\r\n\"General Jackson himself, to the end of his life, never liked to begin\r\nanything of consequence on Friday, and would not if it could be avoided\r\nwithout serious injury to some important interest.\" So far from abstaining\r\nfrom any undertaking on Friday, the general has told me himself that he\r\nmade it a point to start on a journey and begin such things on that day;\r\nand he laughed at the superstition. Nevertheless, I am inclined to suspect\r\nthat this very fact should be taken as evidence that the superstition did\r\nexist in him; that he was conscious of it; that his judgment told him it\r\nwas an unworthy weakness; and that he was determined to conquer it. He\r\nacknowledged its influence by the care he took to defy it.\r\n\r\nIn those days visitors to the White House knocked or rang as they would at\r\nthe mansion-door of any private gentleman. One rainy day a visitor thus\r\nannounced himself, but for some reason no servant appeared immediately to\r\nadmit him. The family heard it, and so did the general in his office, where\r\nhe was writing. It did not occur to me or any one else that interference\r\nwith the servants' duties was necessary. Suddenly there was a rustle of\r\npapers and an apparition. \"What!\" thundered the President. \"A citizen of\r\nthe United States stands knocking at my door in the rain, and it isn't\r\nopened!\" The door was opened soon after that remark.\r\n\r\nOne day the general received a letter of four or five pages of foolscap\r\nfrom Ireland--I do not know whether it came from Carrickfergus or not--in\r\nwhich the writer said that he was a cousin of the President's, and that he\r\nrecollected perfectly when the general was born, and gave the exact\r\nlocality and all the attendant circumstances. He closed by saying he would\r\nlike to come over. Jackson laughed over the letter, and expressed his\r\nsurprise that he should have been born in Ireland and in Carolina too.\r\n\r\nIt was his custom, when he had no one dining with him besides the family,\r\nto say, as he raised his single glass of wine, \"Here's to absent friends!\"\r\nThen, glancing toward me, he would add in a low tone, \"And sweethearts,\r\ntoo,----.\"\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, when I was ill, the general called in Dr. Hunt, his family\r\nphysician. The doctor was a tall, lank, ugly man--\"as good as gold,\" but\r\nwith none of the graces that are supposed to win young ladies; yet he was\r\nmarried to one of the loveliest young creatures I ever knew. General\r\nJackson accompanied him to my room, and after my pulse had been duly felt\r\nand my tongue duly inspected, they drew their chairs to the fire and began\r\nto talk.\r\n\r\n\"Hunt,\" suddenly exclaimed the President, \"how came you to get such a young\r\nand pretty wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you,\" replied the doctor. \"I was called to attend a young\r\nlady at the convent in Georgetown. Her eyes were bad: she had to keep them\r\nbandaged. I cured her without her ever having had a distinct view of me.\r\nShe left the institution, and a year afterward she appeared here in\r\nsociety, a belle and a beauty. At a ball I introduced myself, without the\r\nslightest ulterior design, as the physician who had restored her sight,\r\nalthough I supposed she had never really seen me. She instantly expressed\r\nthe most heartfelt gratitude. It seemed so deep and genuine that I was\r\ntouched. That very evening she informed me that she had a severe cold, and\r\nthat I must again prescribe for her. Well! it don't look reasonable, but I\r\ndid it. I wrote my name on a bit of paper, folded it and handed it to her,\r\ntelling her she must take that prescription. She read it and laughed. 'It's\r\na bitter pill,' she said, 'and must be well gilded if ever I take it.' But\r\nwhether it was bitter or whether it was gilded, we were married.\"\r\n\r\nThe hospitality of the White House at that time, like that of the\r\nHermitage, has become proverbial. Very few brought letters of introduction\r\nwho were not invited to dinner. Consequently, the table was almost always\r\nfull. It seemed to me that Jackson never heard of a wrong to any human\r\nbeing, or what he conceived to be such, without trying to right it.\r\n\r\nWhen Aaron Burr was at the Hermitage in 1805 he wrote in his diary, for the\r\nentertainment of Theodosia: \"The general has no children, but two lovely\r\nnieces made a visit of some days, contributed greatly to my amusement, and\r\nhave cured me of all the evils of my wilderness jaunt. If I had time I\r\nwould describe to you these two girls, for they deserve it.\" The temptation\r\nis strong to give the descriptions omitted by Mr. Burr, but it would lead\r\nme too far. They were nieces of Mrs. Jackson rather than the general's. One\r\nof them, whom he had adopted as his daughter, married her cousin, A. J.\r\nDonelson--her own maiden name being also Donelson--who was secretary to the\r\nPresident when I knew them, afterward minister to Austria, and candidate\r\nfor Vice-President in 1856 on the ticket with Mr. Fillmore.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday evening, after dinner, Mrs. Donelson, Mrs. Jackson and I, with\r\nseveral other ladies, were gossiping in the Blue Room. This Mrs. Jackson,\r\nwho had been a pretty Philadelphia girl, was the wife of another cousin and\r\nnephew who was born a Donelson, but who was adopted by the general, took\r\nthe name of Jackson and inherited the Hermitage. Mr. Van Buren, then\r\nSecretary of State, had what is now known as \"the inside track\" for the\r\nsuccession. He, was the friend and choice of Jackson; and that settled it\r\nin the minds of those who knew both men. Mrs. Jackson--the lady mentioned\r\nabove, of course, for the General's wife did not live to see the White\r\nHouse--disliked Van Buren for some reason. Mrs. Donelson, turning to me\r\nwith affected gravity, said, \"When you are Mrs. President Van Buren, I want\r\nyou to send my husband to England as minister.\" I solemnly assured her she\r\nshould have whatever she wished. Then Mrs. Barker appealed to me in behalf\r\nof her husband as collector at Philadelphia. Turning to Mrs. Jackson, I\r\nasked what she would like. \"Nothing at Mr. Van Buren's hands,\" was the\r\nsudden reply. At that instant I heard a rustle behind me. There stood Mr.\r\nVan Buren! He was smiling, and evidently amused. We were so completely\r\ncaught that there was no resource but the suppressed giggling little scream\r\nthat never fails a true woman when no other strategy is possible. He gave\r\nno intimation of having heard a word. Indeed, I never saw Mr. Van Buren's\r\nperfect self-possession fail him but once: that was when he fell off his\r\nhorse for me on Pennsylvania Avenue. And with this ridiculous performance\r\nthese rambling reminiscences must end.\r\n\r\nOne fine spring morning the President insisted that we should invite the\r\nCass girls, the Forsyths and some others, make a riding-party, and return\r\nwith them all to the White House for lunch. He sent to Mr. Blair for the\r\nwhite horse he had ridden in a grand procession at New York, which Blair\r\nhad bought. This fiery charger, very appropriate for such a horseman as\r\nGeneral Jackson on a state occasion, was so spirited and appeared so\r\nunmanageable that I was afraid to touch him. But the general had made up\r\nhis mind that I should ride that horse on that occasion, and I knew what it\r\nmeant when his mind was made up. He put me on himself, saying, \"Why, child,\r\nif you can't ride him, you couldn't ride a sheep.\" We reached the avenue\r\nvery well, when the horse seemed to remember New York and General Jackson.\r\nHe reared, plunged and dashed off. Mr. Van Buren, in trying to seize the\r\nreins, was drawn from his own saddle and dragged some distance. His\r\nposition for a few moments was rather undignified, but he came up smiling\r\nand unhurt, and made as creditable an appearance as could be expected. We\r\nhad a happy day in spite of the mishap, but not even the will of General\r\nJackson ever got me on that horse again.\r\n\r\nM. T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LAW UNTO HERSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nThe reason which Mr. Van Ness offered for Jane's disappearance, he\r\nprotested, would suggest itself to everybody as the only possible one: her\r\ngrief had deranged her, and she had wandered away bent on self-destruction.\r\nBut the house was filled now with the friends of the captain, among them\r\nJudge Rhodes and Mrs. Wilde, and he read doubt and lurking suspicion on\r\nevery face. The judge, it is true, directed the hurried searches through\r\nthe grounds and the dragging of the lake.\r\n\r\n\"But I wish the captain had not pushed the marriage so hard. Drill-major to\r\nthe last gasp. I was to blame in suggesting it at first,\" he said,\r\npoint-blank to Van Ness.\r\n\r\n\"Suicide? Nothing of the kind,\" said Mrs. Wilde. \"Jane is eccentric, as\r\nevery thoroughly truthful woman is. But sane. One of the sanest people I\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nShe summoned Betty, and the two women were closeted together for half an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n\"You should have sent for me,\" she said when the story was ended. \"The\r\nchild should not have been left to the tender mercies of these men. Call\r\nhim in.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Van Ness appeared he saw that the old lady's eyes were red.\r\n\r\n\"You are going in pursuit of her? Mrs. Nichols has told me all,\" she said\r\nblandly.\r\n\r\n\"I shall search for her, undoubtedly. Her mind was evidently shaken. There\r\nis a bare chance that she may have gone on the train. But the river being\r\nso near and her grief so great, I fear the worst, Mrs. Wilde.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt, no doubt! But if you do follow her on the train--How was she\r\ndressed, Betty?\"\r\n\r\n\"In gray. Black hat and gray feather,\" said Betty like a parrot.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you! That will be of assistance to me.--They are trying to help her\r\nescape,\" he thought as he went out, with a bow and melancholy smile. He had\r\nwaited to talk with Mr. Lampret. He asked him for a certificate of the\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n\"If my wife is living and wandering insane through the country, it will be\r\nnecessary to prove my right to claim her.\"\r\n\r\nTo his surprise, the clergyman grew red and stammered, with a painful\r\nanxiety in his boyish face.\r\n\r\n\"I fear we were too hasty, Mr. Van Ness. Are you quite sure she consented\r\nfreely to the marriage? There was no moral compulsion used?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was none,\" coldly. \"My marriage, as I believe, had in it all the\r\nelements of future happiness. Besides, that is hardly a question, it\r\nappears to me, for you to consider now. Whether suitable or not, the\r\nmarriage was legal. When can you give me the certificate?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lampret did not speak for a moment. \"I suppose it is irrevocable,\" he\r\nsaid with a long breath. \"The making out of the certificate will involve a\r\ndelay of a couple of hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall wait for it,\" said Van Ness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was midnight before he left The Hemlocks and took the train into New\r\nYork. There he had other work to do, which consumed an hour or two. He must\r\nlay plans to free himself from any hold which Charlotte had upon him. He\r\nhad not courage to live, in even the rare delights to which he looked\r\nforward as Jane's husband, with that sword at his throat. He could find no\r\ntrace of Charlotte. But he wakened up a lawyer (not the eminent counsel who\r\nsystematized his vast benevolent schemes), and gave him full instructions\r\nand a blank cheque.\r\n\r\n\"I must have this connection closed at once. And at any price,\" he said as\r\nhe left the door at one o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"To Desbrosses street ferry. In time to catch the Philadelphia express,\" he\r\nordered the cabman.\r\n\r\nHe had not tried to find a clew to her in New York. She was unknown\r\nthere--not likely to be recognized even by officials on the trains running\r\nup to The Hemlocks.\r\n\r\n\"She would try to escape from a place where she is a stranger. But it would\r\ncut her deeply to leave her father unburied,\" he argued shrewdly. \"She\r\nwould go direct to their old home in Philadelphia, where the associations\r\nwith him were strongest. She is full of such foolish notions!\" He glowed\r\nwith admiration of these warm affections, so becoming to a beautiful woman,\r\nas he leaned back in his seat in the car. Van Ness had indeed a keen\r\nappreciation of fine sentiments in books or in people. A noble thought\r\nfitly uttered or a pathetic strain of music would bring the tears to his\r\neyes. All his friends will testify to-day that he is a man of most\r\nsensitive nature. He remembered this admirable trait in himself as he sat\r\nthinking over his future married life that night. It was one of the means\r\nby which he would be sure to win the love of his wife, and drive away her\r\ngrief for the poor old captain. He took out a tiny volume from his pocket\r\nand studied it carefully by the dull light of the lamp overhead. The\r\nconductor, who knew the great Christian financier by sight, looked on\r\nreverently at a distance. It was some epitome of wisdom that he pored over:\r\nperhaps the Book of books. There was, in fact, a little mirror set in the\r\ninside of the binding. Van Ness studied the glisten on his yellow beard,\r\nthe gluey softness of his blue eyes. \"There never was a woman who would not\r\nyield to me,\" he thought, shutting the book. \"But it does not matter\r\nwhether she does or not,\" he added, his fingers searching for the marriage\r\ncertificate in his pocket and closing on it with a fierce grip.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nVan Ness had really but slight knowledge of the places in which Jane's\r\nearly life had been passed. On reaching Philadelphia he was forced to\r\nsearch through old directories for the houses in which the captain had\r\nlived, and go to them in turn--a tedious process enough, as the old man had\r\nmigrated, as his whim or purse dictated, from Kensington to Southwark, from\r\na close-built block in the business quarter to a tumble-down cottage on the\r\nWissahickon. It was near night before he arrived at the old house\r\nsurrounded by trees in the Neck which had been their last home in\r\nPhiladelphia. Disappointment and secret rage had only made the unctuous\r\nsweetness of his manner a little coarser in flavor. The woman who came to\r\nthe door adjusting a pink bow at her collar found his familiar greeting\r\nexactly suited to the level of her own breeding.\r\n\r\n\"A young lady? With blue eyes and yellow hair? Oh yes, sir. Colored pretty\r\nmuch like yourself. But she don't favor you, either. Come in! come in! My\r\nname's Crawford. Young lady's yer sister, likely?\"\r\n\r\n\"At what time was she here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just at breakfast-time. Well, say seven. She didn't come in no furder than\r\nthis room. Said she'd lived here with a friend, and would like to take a\r\nlook ag'in at the old place. She sat there, on that settee, and looked in\r\nthe fire a while, and then went out to the garden and walked up and down. I\r\nsuspicioned she wa'n't right in her mind,\" volubly. \"The idee of comin'\r\nback to look at a house and yard! I guess I was right. Somethin'\r\nwantin'--eh?\" touching her forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Do you know in which direction she went, Mrs. Crawford?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the least notion. If I'd ha' had any intimation, now, that she\r\nhad escaped from her friends, I'd ha' done all I could to help 'em. My\r\nGeorge could hev' followed her all day, for that matter. What was the\r\ncause, now? Religious excitement? Disappintment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both, both! You did not observe her dress, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I did. Brown waterproof and brown hat. 'Twouldn't be easy to trace\r\nher by her dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she speak of returning here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I wish I'd incouraged her!\" her zeal reaching fever-heat in this\r\nhinted tragedy. \"She come in an' thanked me very gravely, an' said she\r\nwould probably never see the old house ag'in. Poor thing! She gave George\r\nsome money, which wa'n't at all necessary, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"If she did not expect to see the house again, she meant to leave the\r\ncity,\" said Van Ness when he was again in the street. \"She will be easily\r\ntraced at the railway-stations.\"\r\n\r\nBut in this he was disappointed. Young women dressed in the uniform\r\ntravelling costume daily came and went in troops through the avenues of\r\ntravel: a dozen indifferent ticket-agents had hazy recollections of this\r\nespecial traveller on her way to Boston, to San Francisco, to Baltimore.\r\nMr. Van Ness, too, found that his own social dignity and prominence sorely\r\nhindered his researches. Everybody in the city knew Pliny Van Ness by\r\nsight. It would not do for him, as for any common man, to go from office to\r\noffice inquiring for the heroine of a mysterious elopement. The Christian\r\nhumanitarian must keep his garments clean of suspicion as jealously as\r\nCaesar's wife.\r\n\r\nReporters, too, had their eyes upon him, turn which way he would, for the\r\nopinions and movements of Mr. Van Ness had long furnished welcome material\r\nfor the columns of \"Personals\" in the morning journals. What if a hint of\r\nthis episode of his marriage and his wife's disappearance should creep into\r\nthe blatant newspapers? He moved, threatened, hampered, by this open-day\r\nterror, one unsuccessful day slipping into another until three weeks had\r\ngone by.\r\n\r\nEarly one chilly October morning he found himself without any definite aim\r\nknocking at Mrs. Crawford's door, and was welcomed by her with effusion,\r\nfor she had supposed her chance of any share in the tragedy to be gone.\r\n\r\n\"And you hain't found her yet, eh? Dear! dear! If I'd only knowed in time!\r\nIt's told on you, sir. Yes, indeed. You've aged considerable in this\r\nmonth.\"\r\n\r\nThe only real change in Van Ness was a certain new alien expression which\r\nwas now and then perceptible under the blandishment of his smile, like some\r\nsavage beast peeping out from behind the painted canvas of his cage. His\r\nnews from the lawyer in New York was unsatisfactory; he was baffled at\r\nevery turn by insignificant difficulties in his search for Jane; there was\r\nevery temptation for the beast which was in him to break its bonds. But\r\nluck had turned for him.\r\n\r\n\"Dear! dear!\" continued Mrs. Crawford. \"Have you tried the police? Though\r\nthey're of little account. She could not have come to any bodily harm. The\r\ndog would protect her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dog? You said nothing about a dog. Had she that damnable brute with her?\"\r\nstarting up.\r\n\r\n\"A large hound; sir. Why, to be sure, I told you!--Lord! he's gone!\"\r\n\r\nHere at last was a clew! It proved effectual. The agent at the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad office remembered distinctly the young girl who wished to take her\r\ndog with her down to some station on the coast, and the difficulty which\r\nthe train-master meant to make about it. \"But she took him,\" he added. \"She\r\nwas a very beautiful woman. Nobody cared to refuse her.\"\r\n\r\nVan Ness went down to the Branch, to Beach Haven, Manasquan, all the\r\nfishing-villages along the coast, among the rest to Sutphen's Point. He\r\ntalked to old Sutphen himself, his foot resting on a barnacle-eaten log\r\nwhere Jane herself had sat the day before. But the old man was loyal. He\r\nwas stupid, stared vacantly at Van Ness, had seen no young woman and no\r\ndog: there had never been any such at the Point. Van Ness went hurriedly on\r\nto the next station, spent a couple of days in the search, and returned to\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n\"So the young lady came back before you?\" said the agent, nodding\r\nfamiliarly as he passed the ticket-window.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You saw her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she bought her ticket of me. Yesterday, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what point?\" Van Ness's voice was so hoarse that the man heard him\r\nwith difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"Richmond. Took the dog, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me a ticket for Richmond, please. When does the next train go?\"\r\n\r\n\"In half an hour. She has twenty-four hours the start of you, sir,\" with a\r\nsignificant laugh as he handed out the ticket and change.\r\n\r\nVan Ness arrived at dawn the following morning at the little wooden shed\r\nwith its garden of dahlias and lilacs which called itself a depot on the\r\noutskirts of the drowsy country town so lately the focus on which had\r\nrested the eyes of the civilized world. Two or three negroes bustled into\r\nactivity as the train rolled in: an old woman dusted the rocking-chairs\r\nabout the stove. They all remembered the tall, handsome young lady with the\r\ndog, who had flung about her money so freely the day before.\r\n\r\n\"I brought her breakfast, sah. I'm Dabney. Everybody knows Dabney's\r\nreliable. Mighty fine hound, sah. De young lady went on to Morganton, Nothe\r\nCallina. Oh, tank you, sah!\"\r\n\r\nMorganton is a village perched on a spur of the Blue Ridge, made dusky by\r\nshadows of overhanging hills. The garrulous landlord of the inn was ready\r\nto point out his prey to Van Ness.\r\n\r\n\"A lady? Miss Swendon, you mean? I've known her since she was a child.\r\nCaptain Swendon came to the Balsam Mountings for years for the hunting.\r\nAllays brought the little girl. She's broken down terrible. Her father's\r\ndeath's interrupted her, powerful.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is here, then?\" lowering his voice.\r\n\r\n\"No. She went on to the captain's camping-ground on the Old Black. Seemed\r\nas if she must go every place where he had been. He allays buried himself\r\namong the mountings. I doubt if you can find the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where Miss Swendon can go I surely can follow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dunno. She's used to the mountings. P'raps you can get a guide at\r\nAsheville. It's the last place whah human beings live--high up on the\r\nBlack: an old hunter, Glenn and his wife--kind, decent people, but not jest\r\ncivilized. The captain was allays in cahoot with them, and they was\r\npowerful fond of Jane.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no regular conveyance then across the Blue Ridge to Asheville.\r\nVan Ness crossed the range on horseback with a guide: the horse broke down,\r\nand caused a delay of a day. He arrived, therefore, at the little hill-town\r\nlate in the afternoon of Friday. Miss Swendon had gone up into the\r\nmountains two days before, he learned, with the old hunter Glenn, who\r\nhappened to be in the village with a load of roots and peltry.\r\n\r\n\"I must go on to-night,\" said Van Ness urgently.\r\n\r\nThe ex-Confederate colonel who kept the inn surveyed him leisurely.\r\n\"Glenn's house lies about thirty miles up in the Balsam Range,\" he said\r\ndeliberately. \"The passes are dangerous in daylight: it would be impossible\r\nto make the ascent at night. I shall not be able to find a guide for you\r\nuntil to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nVan Ness was exhausted in mind and body. The night's rest was tempting.\r\n\r\n\"I shall find her at this man Glenn's? She will not go farther?\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel laughed: \"Not unless she turns hermit or takes up her lodging\r\nwith the wild beasts. Glenn's hut is the last human habitation on the\r\nmountains. You have her, sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will take supper and a bed.\"\r\n\r\nHe slept soundly that night, and sipped his coffee at breakfast\r\ncomfortably, smiling now and then to himself. The silly creature was making\r\nherself happy this morning in the mountain-fastness, going over her\r\nfather's old haunts, thinking that she was hidden where he would never find\r\nher. But how easily he had run her down! The horses and guide were waiting\r\nat the door. Before the sun set he would have her in his hold securely, as\r\neasily as he could grasp that bird in its cage yonder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGlenn's house was in fact but a rambling log hut built under the shelter of\r\none of the peaks of the Old Black. The Appalachian ranges at this point\r\nreach their highest altitude on the continent. The unbroken primeval forest\r\ncame up to the very door of the hut. A few feet off a stream, the\r\nhead-water of the Swannanoa, dashed over the precipice.\r\n\r\nAs the sun was setting that evening, the old hunter's wife waited in the\r\ndoor to meet Jane, who came slowly down the gorge, with the dog beside her.\r\nThe two women stood together watching the red ball of fire go down behind\r\nOld Craggy. It threw sharp shafts of light into the heavy cloud that hung\r\nhalfway up the peak, while overhead the sky was green and translucent as\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe hunter's wife did not speak to Jane as she stood beside her, and did\r\nnot watch her. The incurious habit of silence of these mountaineers rested\r\nthe girl. They had been her friends when she was a little girl: she had\r\ncome back, as sure of finding their friendship as the rock on which their\r\nhouse was built. She had come up with her heart and brain full of\r\nunwholesome sickness to be cured in these silent solitudes of the world.\r\nThe cure was begun. Her eye was clearer, the hopeless load was lifted from\r\nher life. What did pain matter? Or death? There was about her here a great\r\nrepose in which these things faded out.\r\n\r\nShe looked at the glittering stream close by, at the unending slopes of\r\nunderbrush blazing scarlet with the rowan and the shonieho, and then beyond\r\nthese lower hills--fold and fold of living color--to the great bare peak\r\nwrapped in clouds, a few dead trees climbing its base, which stands like a\r\nmighty warder of the Atlantic coast. The tears rose to her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"One must have a mean and selfish soul to be unhappy here,\" she thought.\r\nThe twilight fell suddenly. The sides of the mountains went into shadow:\r\nonly the sky about the peaks burned redly. Jane went in and sat down by the\r\nold hunter before the big log-fire.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you to let me stay with you,\" she said. \"I have a little money,\r\nwhich will last a long time here. After it is gone I can make more,\r\nsomehow.\"\r\n\r\nGlenn for answer only put out his hand and touched hers gently. The hand\r\nwas as bony as her father's, and his hair was as white. That comforted the\r\ngirl more than any words. His wife, who was always the speaker, said,\r\n\"You've always been welcome, Jane. You know that. You won't need money. We\r\nget our living out of the mountings for the taking of it. When your father\r\nwas gone it was nateral for you to come straight here, an' to stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I will stay,\" said Jane.\r\n\r\nPresently the old man raised his hand: \"Hark! There's folks coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear nothing, father,\" said Mrs. Glenn.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. There's horses at the lower ford. Two of 'em. They're acrost now.\r\nIt's more'n a year since anybody's bin up the mounting. Kin it be any one\r\na-followin' you, Jane?\"\r\n\r\nShe got up slowly: \"Who could follow me?\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment the hoofs of the horses rang on the shelving rocks outside.\r\nThe door opened, and Van Ness stood on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nThe Scotia was within a few hours of Liverpool. The passengers were all\r\ngathered on deck--the women, eager and garrulous, eying each other a little\r\ncuriously in their new costumes--even the most _blase_ traveller among them\r\nroused by the smell of land. Miss Fleming, however, sat quietly apart, with\r\nMr. Neckart beside her. The other passengers were accustomed to see these\r\ntwo together, silent and uncommunicative even to each other. Cornelia had\r\nearly understood that Neckart's ailment, whatever it was, whether mood or\r\ndisease, craved quiet. She instantly suited herself to its need. Captain\r\nSwendon had always rejoiced in her as one of the most loquacious and\r\nsociable of human beings. Bruce, on the contrary, was strongly attracted by\r\nthe aloofness and unconscious repose of this taciturn woman, who held\r\nherself apart from the vulgarly fashionable crowd in the cabins, not being\r\nof their kind. He fell into the habit of taking his seat near her, partly\r\nto avoid the others, partly for the comfort of being able to sleep, talk,\r\nor be silent undisturbed. After a few days he began to be conscious of a\r\nfine similarity of taste and convictions between them. Whether it was a\r\nquestion of political law or the color of a curling wave, Cornelia's\r\nthought about it evidently ran in the same groove as his own, though more\r\nweakly, as became the intellect of a woman. A word or a laughing glance was\r\nenough to convey this subtle sympathy between them. It had undeniably\r\nsoothed and brightened the passage.\r\n\r\nBruce Neckart, at night, alone in his state-room, knew that he had left\r\nambition, love, happiness, behind him--that he was cut off from all the\r\nchances of life. At night the indescribable feeling of vacancy at the base\r\nof the brain, the stricture as of an iron band about his jaws, the\r\noccasional sudden numbness of nerve and thought, as though he were stricken\r\nfor the instant with extreme old age, were hints which brought his\r\napproaching fate before him as with a horror of great darkness. But on\r\ndeck, in daylight, the swell lapping the vessel, his feeble appetite\r\ngratified by a well-cooked meal, there was some interest yet to be found in\r\nthe Southern problem or the claims of the Pre-Raphaelites; and he was\r\ngrateful to Chance for this companion who sat ready to grasp any subject\r\nwhich attracted him, with a woman's fine intuition, but who demanded only\r\nthe personal courtesy due to an innocent, manly boy. She showed him, too,\r\nduring the voyage, much womanly, personal kindness, for which, being of an\r\nhonest, affectionate nature, he was grateful.\r\n\r\nNow that they were nearing land, therefore, Mr. Neckart's thoughts as he\r\nsat beside her were wholly busied with his companion. He was heartily sorry\r\nfor her. Ordinary observers, he reflected, would mistake her for one of the\r\nstrong-minded Advanced Sisterhood, but he knew her to be sensitive and\r\ndelicate in the extreme. He felt a certain sense of ownership in her as his\r\ndiscovery. How was she to find her way alone in Europe? He had meant to\r\ncut absolutely loose from every tie of his past life on landing, but this\r\nthread held him still. Could he arrange any future occasional intercourse\r\nwith her? He did not mean to hamper himself at all. Still, he might be\r\nuseful to her, etc., etc. In short, the pillow on which he had rested his\r\naching head had been warm and pleasant to him, and he threw it away\r\nreluctantly. There really was no reason, he argued (according to the\r\ninvariable argument of men concerning this woman), no reason whatever, why\r\nfirm and fervent friendships should not exist between persons of opposite\r\nsex. He would have been insulted at a hint that this sympathy, _bonne\r\ncamaraderie_, with the little woman in green beside him involved disloyalty\r\nto Jane. The little woman, however, gave neither of these fine names to\r\ntheir traffic of sentiment. The Cornelias of their sex make no mistakes in\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\nIt was a sombre, foreboding day. The passengers were gathered on the\r\nforward deck. Neckart and Cornelia were alone, the gray fog shutting them\r\nin. She sat with her head turned from him, immovable, but he was conscious,\r\nthrough the strong subtle magnetism that belonged to this woman, of the\r\npowerful excitement which she controlled. He quite forgot his own trouble.\r\nThis delicate, lonely creature venturing into the world! He asked her some\r\nquestions as to her plans on landing, but she answered vaguely. She heard\r\nonly the throb of the steamer beating out the few moments left to her. Her\r\nwhole life was risked upon this voyage. Had she failed? There was but an\r\nhour left. What woman could do she had done. Good God! why must she be\r\nsilent? Her whole soul had called out for this man for years: she had loved\r\nhim with a man's force of passion. Why could she not speak now and tell him\r\nso? She must sit beside him dumb, lifeless, unless he put out his hand to\r\ntake her!\r\n\r\n\"Half-past four,\" said Neckart, looking at his watch. \"I am sure you are\r\nsorry the voyage is so nearly over.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not speak, but he caught a gleam in her eye that startled him.\r\nUnder all her coldness she was a strange, vivid creature well worth study.\r\nHe leaned forward eagerly,\r\n\r\n\"Your undertaking terrifies you, now that the time has come. You would\r\nrather turn back?\"\r\n\r\nShe moved restlessly under his keen scrutiny, as though it hurt her. Her\r\nhands were clasped on her knees, her eyes fixed on the black line on the\r\nhorizon which marked land. \"No, I will go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cornelia,\" with warm kindness in his face and voice, \"I am afraid you have\r\noverrated your devotion to your work. A woman must be possessed by her art\r\nas by a demon to enable her to endure years of solitude in a foreign\r\ncountry, homeless and friendless. Have you counted all the cost? When you\r\nleave me you cut yourself loose from all your old life.\" She turned her\r\nhead away, but made no reply. \"I do not believe you are strong enough, poor\r\nchild!\" he said presently.\r\n\r\nSilence pleaded for her as no words of her own could have done. Neckart saw\r\nthe strained eyes, the quivering chin: his interest suddenly became alive,\r\nintense--a feeling quite apart from the kindliness which his words\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\n\"I begin to think you have mistaken your vocation altogether. You are too\r\ndependent, too tender a woman, for an artist. You should have chosen a\r\ndomestic life, Cornelia.\" And, after an embarrassed pause of a moment, \"You\r\nshould have married.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw the quick shudder: his own blood beat feverishly. He had always been\r\ncurious about women. He would push the probe a little deeper: \"If there had\r\nbeen any friend who was more to you than your art?--\"\r\n\r\nShe turned her head slowly. The bleached face and burning eyes fastened on\r\nhis own told her story before she spoke: \"I have had no friend but you,\r\nBruce.\"\r\n\r\nNeckart started to his feet, hot from head to foot like a blushing girl. He\r\npaced the deck dumb with shame and confusion. It was long before he found\r\ncourage to look at her. Her hands were clasped over her face: she was\r\nsobbing in a helpless, strengthless way that seemed to put her on the\r\nground at his feet. He looked toward the land. Would it never come nearer?\r\nFinally, feeling himself wholly a scoundrel, and moved by a great\r\ncompassion and as great annoyance, he pushed the green cloak aside and sat\r\ndown hastily on the bench beside her, beginning to talk rapidly. If the\r\nlimb must come off, the quicker the better.\r\n\r\n\"I understand just what you mean, Miss Fleming. You need a friend, an\r\nadviser, being here in Europe alone. Of course you turn to me, remembering\r\nold times in Delaware, and--and--\" She had stopped sobbing now, and was\r\nwatching him breathlessly, her eyes following his lips as he spoke.\r\nNeckart, looking at her, broke down.\r\n\r\n\"How can I do it?\" he thought. \"This woman's whole life has been given to\r\nme, and I did not know it!--It's natural,\" he began again aloud, \"that you\r\nshould turn to me. You know how gladly I would be your friend--\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, her straining eyes on his. \"Yes, gladly--thankfully!\"\r\n(Surely, it was only right to soften the blow.) \"You cannot know how--how\r\ndear you have always been to me, Cornelia. But I can have nothing to do\r\nwith friendship or any other relation which makes a man's life worth\r\nendurance. I am barred out from so much of my birthright by my blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Bruce?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know the fate of the Davidges: I need not go over the story. God knows\r\nit is not a pleasant subject for me to dwell upon. But for the last year I\r\nhave had unmistakable proof that I have the hereditary disease. That is the\r\nreason why I have given up my business and every tie in life, and\r\nexpatriated myself.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke she rose, shaken with excitement; her face took on a new\r\nmeaning; for the moment she was a young and beautiful woman: \"Oh, Bruce!\r\nBruce! you are all wrong! Is it possible that you have never been\r\nundeceived? There is not a drop of the Davidge blood in your veins!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard the story from my mother a hundred times. Your father was\r\nmarried twice--the first time in Maryland, where you were born. Your mother\r\ndied at your birth. He came to Kent county and married Miss Davidge, who\r\nnever had any children. It was the first symptom of her insanity that she\r\nconceived the idea that you were her own son, and your father willingly\r\nhumored her in the belief. You were deceived too as a child, lest you might\r\nbetray the real facts to her. But I thought when you were a man you would\r\nbe told the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I?\" said Neckart, bewildered. \"My father died when I was a boy\r\nof ten, and my mother--But she was not my mother!\" His eyes filled: he\r\nturned hastily away. It seemed to him as if the dear old mother had just\r\nthen died to him.\r\n\r\nCornelia timidly touched his arm: \"But you do not understand. You are not a\r\nDavidge. You are free from the Davidge disease.\"\r\n\r\n\"Free?\" It was not easy to turn back the convictions and terrors of a\r\nlifetime in a moment. He stared at her stunned: \"Then these symptoms have\r\nbeen only caused by overwork, as the doctors said? I--I am like other men?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Merciful God!\"\r\n\r\nCornelia leaned over the taffrail. Would he come to her? The blood ebbed\r\nweakly in her veins; the rush of the water below roared like thunder; as\r\nthe minutes passed a deadly sickness came into her breast. She looked to\r\nfind him. He was at the other end of the deck, talking with the captain,\r\nhis swarthy face glowing, his eyes like coals of fire.\r\n\r\n\"The Russia is the first steamer to New York,\" she heard the captain say.\r\n\"You can board her to-night. This is a very sudden resolution, Mr.\r\nNeckart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But I must return to my business at once. There are other matters too\r\nwhich--matters which I have neglected.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your health? You mentioned a cerebral disorder which required rest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am much better! The sea-voyage--I am another man, sir!\"\r\n\r\nHe walked down the deck, his back toward her. It was the heavy figure, the\r\nswinging awkward gait, which she remembered twenty years ago on the old\r\nfarm-road. The world was born anew to him: health, work, chances--he had\r\nbut to stretch out his hands and clutch them all again, and under all was\r\nthe sweet triumphant passion.\r\n\r\n\"Jane! Jane!\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes strained back over the long waste of water. But as for Cornelia,\r\nhe had forgotten that she was in the world.\r\n\r\nWhen the people were leaving the steamer to go on the tug, she came up to\r\nhim. It was easier to bear another turn of the rack than be utterly dropped\r\nout of remembrance.\r\n\r\n\"We part here, Mr. Neckart,\" with an admirably cordial little smile,\r\nholding out her gloved hand.\r\n\r\nNeckart stammered with sudden remorse and pity: \"'Pon my soul, Miss\r\nFleming, I forgot that you were going ashore! Forgive me. But a man\r\nreprieved with the axe at his neck can't be expected to have his senses at\r\ncall.\"\r\n\r\n\"You go back, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, immediately! I must regain my--my work. What can I do for you?\"\r\nzealously. \"Your baggage, now? There will be nothing dutiable, of course.\r\nWill you have it sent to London or direct to the Continent? You told me\r\nyour plans, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"You have forgotten them,\" smiling. \"The baggage is already on its way. You\r\nforget I am one of the capable, self-reliant sisterhood. No. You can do\r\nnothing for me but to say good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nNeckart caught her hand and wrung it vehemently, but it lay with its smooth\r\nkid covering passive in his palm. He began to say something to her about\r\nher art and success, but the words seemed a ghastly mockery and died in his\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I shall succeed, undoubtedly, but in a low grade. My ability is of\r\ninferior quality. I know all my limitations,\" with a sudden metallic laugh.\r\n\r\n\"You will return in a year or two, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I shall not return. I shall never see you again,\" looking for the\r\nfirst time in his face.\r\n\r\nNeckart glanced beyond her to the strange city, vast and dreary in the\r\ntwilight and drizzle and falling soot. The docks were swarming with life.\r\nSome of their fellow-passengers had already landed and been met by eager\r\nfriends, and were driven away to their homes. This woman was going\r\nfriendless into the night and crowd. She was so little and lonely and\r\nhardly used! But what could he do? He had not a minute to lose if he would\r\nboard the Russia.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Fleming, I owe a fresh lease of life to you. I shall always think of\r\nyou with gratitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I gave you was a free gift,\" she said in a very quiet voice. \"I want\r\nno gratitude in return for it. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nShe suddenly raised his hand and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\"Cornelia!\"\r\n\r\nBut she was gone, and in a moment was lost in the hurrying crowds, on which\r\na sullen rain was beginning to fall.\r\n\r\nBefore midnight Neckart was ploughing his way back. His brain was quite\r\nclear--no threats of paralysis or sudden age. He lay awake building honest\r\nair-castles--new plans for the paper, dreams of happiness for Jane as fresh\r\nand sweet as a boy's of his first love. But through them all the kiss on\r\nhis hand burned like fire. He rubbed it again and again angrily.\r\n\r\nHe wanted no guilty damned spot about him when he came to Jane.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nWhen the door of the hut opened Bruno growled furiously. Mr. Van Ness\r\nappeared on the threshold, smiling, benign, a goodly sight, from his blond\r\nhead and the yellow topaz on his snowy shirt-front to the polished boots.\r\n\r\n\"Down, Bruno, down!\" said Jane.\r\n\r\nThe old hunter observed that though she stood erect she could not bring her\r\nvoice above a whisper. She looked at Van Ness like a kid that the dogs\r\nwere going to tear to death. Glenn came up hastily between her and the\r\nstranger. He had the dog's sudden antipathy to him and to his smile.\r\n\r\n\"What is your business?\"\r\n\r\nVan Ness advanced and held out his hand cordially. The mountains had had\r\ntheir effect upon him: his irritated nerves lay now quieted out of sight in\r\nthe thick cool flesh. As he ascended the heights he had laid his plans.\r\nGentleness first, force if need be: gentle measures would no doubt suffice.\r\nThe law would ensure to him immediate possession of his wife. She had the\r\ndevilish obstinacy of a mule, but she was his wife. He would bring her to\r\nlove him at last, and their future life would be eminently respectable and\r\ncomfortable. Laidley's estate must yield now, on an average? The remainder\r\nof the ride had passed in pleasant calculation. Never had his temper been\r\nmore serene or firm than when he presented himself before his wife.\r\n\r\n\"What's your business?\" said the old man.\r\n\r\n\"My business,\" gently, \"is with that lady. I have followed her here from\r\nNew York, and I thank you heartily, sir, for taking care of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I'll take care of Jane. I'll not allow her to be follered or\r\ndisturbed, neyther.--Do you want to see this man, child?\"\r\n\r\nJane did not hear him. Her eyes were fastened on the handsome figure, all\r\nlight and benignity. She had thought she was done with it for ever. It\r\nseemed to her now as if it never would leave her sight again.\r\n\r\n\"You kin see clearly that you're unwelcome to her,\" said Glenn.--\"Wife,\r\ntake Jane into her own room until this gentleman is gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I go,\" said Van Ness with a pleasant, airy wave of the hand, \"she\r\ngoes with me. You are kind, my dear sir, but unreasonable. I have a claim\r\nupon this lady which even you will allow is sufficient.\"\r\n\r\n\"What claim has he on you, Jane?\" turning his back abruptly on Van Ness.\r\n\"Has he any right to talk in this way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I am his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wife! Married! Not accordin' to law?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is the certificate.\"\r\n\r\nAt the sight of this slip of paper, and with the rustle of it in Glenn's\r\nhand, her strength ebbed away from Jane. It was the Law. Her prejudices and\r\ndislikes seemed suddenly insignificant, helpless, in this mighty force. It\r\nhad the same effect on the ignorant, law-abiding mountaineer.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see but as it's correct,\" turning it over, perplexed. \"She's yer\r\nlegal wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter ef she were his wife a hundred times,\" cried his wife: \"she\r\nshall not go back ef she chooses to stay. P'raps he's abused her. He shall\r\nnot force her away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no wish to force her to leave you,\" in the same gentle, cheerful\r\ntone. \"Be rational, dear friends. I leave Jane to answer whether I have\r\never used toward her a word or action that was not loving and tender.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jane, dully.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know anything of me which would justify your flight? Answer me\r\ncandidly. Is there a single reason why you should not honor and respect me\r\nas your husband?\"\r\n\r\nJane was silent. The law within her gave a savage answer. But what was that\r\nbut blind prejudice? She must answer according to the judgment of the\r\noutside world.\r\n\r\n\"Is there any reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--none.\"\r\n\r\nVan Ness nodded cheerfully, and motioned the hunter and his wife\r\nconfidentially to his side: \"I will explain the matter to you precisely as\r\nit stands,\" his light eyes looking over their heads to Jane.\r\n\r\nShe stood irresolutely a moment, and then went into the little room which\r\nhad been set apart for her. She could not draw her breath so near to him.\r\n\r\nVan Ness, peering through the open door, saw that there was but one narrow\r\nwindow inside, opening over a sheer descent of rocks. \"It is quite natural\r\nthat you should love Jane and wish to defend her, as you knew her when she\r\nwas a child,\" he said, raising his voice that she might hear. \"But you do\r\nnot understand. She married me of her own free will by the bedside of her\r\ndying father. His last act was to give her to me with his blessing. You can\r\njudge whether he would have chosen an unworthy husband for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tain't likely,\" said Glenn. But his wife shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"An hour after his death Jane escaped: left her dead father--left me whom\r\nshe loved. The only rational way of accounting for her course is that the\r\nnervous strain had proved too much for her, and that she was temporarily\r\ninsane. You can question her whether I have stated the facts correctly.\"\r\n\r\nThe old people glanced doubtfully in at the tall figure standing motionless\r\nat the open window.\r\n\r\n\"She don't contradict you in nothin', sir. I'm sorry ef I was onjust to\r\nyou,\" said the old man slowly.\r\n\r\n\"I honor you for it! You could have no claim to my friendship as strong as\r\nyour affection for my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" with deliberation, \"we've allays been powerful fond of Jane. But\r\nmarriage is marriage. We won't interfere. Them as God hes jined together--\"\r\n\r\nVan Ness rose: \"I shall take her with me to Asheville. Her mental trouble\r\nmay make her seem disinclined to go. But firmness and affectionate care\r\nwill soon restore her.\" He walked to the door: \"Come, my dear wife.\"\r\n\r\nJane turned and faced him. Her very lips seemed withered: \"I have given you\r\nthe money.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want _you_.\"\r\n\r\nVan Ness waited smiling, without a word after that, his white hands held\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\"Come, my pretty!\" whispered the old woman, stroking her arm soothingly.\r\n\"Suppose you don't like him so much at first? You'll grow into it. Hundreds\r\nof women marry without love. You must give up to the law.\"\r\n\r\nThe law, the whole world, were against her.\r\n\r\nVan Ness came closer, step by step, with the inexorable steadiness of Fate\r\nin his eye. Mrs. Glenn drew back and left them alone.\r\n\r\n\"You married me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to give you the money. There was my mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot repair it. There is no one to help you.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked out at the bare peaks and the sky near at hand, and raised her\r\narms, clasping her hands back of her head. Her lips moved. \"God will help\r\nme,\" Van Ness thought he heard her say.\r\n\r\nHe put his hand on her shoulder: \"Come. We must return to-night, at least\r\npart of the way,\" with quiet authority.\r\n\r\nHe drew her toward him, stooped to kiss her lips.\r\n\r\nAt that moment there was a loud knocking at the outer door, and a man and\r\nwoman entered. Van Ness saw them. His hand fell from Jane's arm, his\r\ncountenance relaxed: for a moment he stood unnerved: then with quick\r\ndecision he stepped boldly forward to meet them, drawing to the door of the\r\nchamber behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Charlotte?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" with a shrug, \"or Princess Trebizoff, Madame Varens, what you\r\nchoose. By any other name I am as dear to you. Heavens! what a chase!\"\r\nperching herself airily on the settle in front of the fire. \"I am one\r\nliving ache.--I can't congratulate you on your roads, madam. But your\r\nscenery! Ah, that goes to the heart!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Neckart stood beside her, calmly waiting until Van Ness should turn to\r\nhim. The great reformer was brought to bay: he was alert, prompt, ready.\r\n\r\n\"You followed me here, Mr. Neckart?\" turning sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"To bring your wife to you,\" glancing at Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\"I inferred that was the story which this poor creature had imposed upon\r\nyou. Surely, you know her character, Neckart? Why, she has levied blackmail\r\nfor years by just such ingenious devices. I did not suppose any statement\r\nof hers would bear a minute's investigation from a shrewd, practical man\r\nlike yourself. So she really deceived you, eh?\" with a discordant laugh.\r\n\r\nCharlotte, drying her dainty feet at the fire, looked contemptuously over\r\nher shoulder at him.\r\n\r\n\"There is no need of any discussion in the matter,\" said Neckart dryly. \"We\r\nare not here to play melodrama. The matter is easily understood. I returned\r\nfrom Europe last week, and went direct to the Hemlock Farm. From the\r\nservants I heard the details of the forced marriage and of Jane's flight. I\r\nfollowed her.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you find her here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Betty Nichols knew that she was coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn her! She hid it from me, her husband!\"\r\n\r\nNeckart stepped hastily forward, then controlled himself and drew back:\r\n\"She had given the route to Charlotte also. I overtook her at Baltimore.\r\nShe had stopped to obtain legal proof of your marriage to her in 1847. We\r\nfollowed an hour behind you from Richmond.\"\r\n\r\nEven in this imminent moment Van Ness secretly wondered how this passionate\r\nbrute of a Neckart held himself in check and talked coolly to the man who\r\nhad stolen from him the woman that he loved. It would have been in\r\ncharacter for him to tear his life out, like Bruno. But this was admirable\r\nself-command! It really gratified Van Ness's taste, tottering on the verge\r\nof ruin as he was. The truth was, that Neckart was conscious of little else\r\nthan that Jane was in the hut. The rage against this scoundrel which had\r\nmaddened him through the long journey had strangely died out. He had not\r\nharmed her. He was like a fangless snake, to be trampled under foot at any\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nBut she was there! He had caught a glimpse of the proud, delicate head and\r\nits crown of yellow hair behind the door as Van Ness closed it.\r\n\r\nThe door moved. It opened, and she came out among them. Neckart rose, his\r\nhead bent upon his breast. He was deaf and blind for the time--could not\r\ntell whether she spoke to him or not.\r\n\r\nShe went directly up to Van Ness: \"I am not your wife?\"\r\n\r\nHe cowered for a moment. Then, rapidly shifting his defence, he stood up,\r\nbenevolent, impregnable: \"I do not deny that I was once married to this\r\nwoman. It was a mad error of my youth, long since repented of. I was\r\ndivorced from her last June.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ta, ta, Pliny, take care!\" interrupted Charlotte. \"The application for\r\ndivorce was not made until after your marriage to Miss Swendon. I told you\r\nyou would not risk a criminal trial for her sake. But I underrated your\r\naffection. You did it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am free?\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"You are free,\" said Charlotte.\r\n\r\nJane turned to the door and went into the open air without a word.\r\n\r\n\"I took a good deal of trouble to come here,\" resumed Charlotte, brushing\r\nsome dust from her flounces, \"to tell her that. I shouldn't have done it\r\nfor any other woman. But you remember that day when I was shamming death,\r\nhow she kissed me, Pliny? I didn't forget that kiss.\"\r\n\r\nVan Ness stood silent, hesitating. The firelight shone upon his tall\r\nfigure, the dainty gray clothes, the shining stone, like a watchful evil\r\neye, upon his breast. He was a perfect presentation of prosperity and\r\npeace. He looked at Neckart, but he was looking through the open door at a\r\nslight figure moving among the rocks.\r\n\r\nVan Ness rubbed his hands softly. \"I do not see,\" he said with unctuous\r\nprecision, \"that further discussion will be of any use in this matter. I\r\nwas evidently mistaken as to point of time in the divorce. No one who knows\r\nme will suspect me of any worse error than a mistake. I will accompany you\r\nto Asheville, Charlotte, with pleasure. I owe you no grudge for the bitter\r\nwrong you have done me.\"\r\n\r\nCharlotte rose and laughed good-naturedly: \"You have your virtues, no\r\ndoubt, Pliny. So have I. I always thought we were well mated. Shall we\r\ncontinue one? You may have to fall back upon my blackmailing devices, after\r\nall. I forgot to tell you that there was an inquiry last week into the\r\ndisposition of the funds entrusted to you for the Home for Friendless\r\nChildren, and that they were reported _nil_.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life Van Ness blenched. The story of the marriage\r\ncould be smothered. But this was total ruin.\r\n\r\n\"The sooner you go the better,\" said the hunter, tapping him on the\r\nshoulder. \"Ef I understand right, you're not the kind of man as ought to\r\npizen these mountings long.\"\r\n\r\nVan Ness moved heavily to the door. But he turned on the threshold with a\r\nsickly smile: \"I forgive you your rudeness, my friend. It is not my nature\r\nto bear malice.--Farewell, Mr. Neckart. You have mistaken my motives in\r\nthis matter. But I shall think of you kindly.--I shall bear you all to the\r\nthrone of grace in my prayers.\" He shook his hand as if scattering\r\nblessings, and went out with a lofty step and head erect.\r\n\r\nCharlotte lingered and went up to Neckart.\r\n\r\n\"You are going to cling to that poor wretch?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he's down now, you see. There's nobody but me to stay by him. And I\r\ncan always draw on him when I'm out of funds.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will remember what I told you of the school in Indiana? You could live\r\nin respectability and comfort; bring your boy home too.\"\r\n\r\n\"My boy? Home?\" Her eyes filled with tears. \"These are very tempting words,\r\nMr. Neckart. But oh-h! Respectability is such a bore! I must go my own gait\r\nto the end;\" and with a merry laugh and shrug she followed Van Ness.\r\n\r\nWhen they were out of sight down the gorge, Neckart rose and went slowly\r\nout to the cleft in the rock where the girl sat alone.\r\n\r\n\"Jane,\" he said, \"the way is open between us at last. Will you come to me?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI cannot write Finis to the story of any of these people. They are all\r\nalive to-day, and the current of each life goes on with very little change.\r\n\r\nYou may still see Van Ness on the platform at all large religious or\r\nbenevolent meetings in the great cities. There was much talk of the missing\r\nfunds, but he quieted it satisfactorily. Cynical reporters throw out hints\r\nof ugly shadows in his life, but his disciples gather more solidly about\r\nhim, trust their souls to his direction and their money to his pockets.\r\nSimple followers of Jesus fear to condemn a light which shines so\r\nsplendidly in the market-place, and men who are not His followers accept it\r\nas Christianity, and damn the religion as spurious and a fraud.\r\n\r\nCharlotte is just now the successful leader of an English opera-bouffe\r\ncompany which is travelling in the West. She gave the proceeds of her\r\nbenefit in every town to the poor last winter, which was supposed by all\r\nrespectable people to be an advertising trick. But it was not. The little\r\nwoman would do more than that to buy herself an entrance into the heaven\r\nwhere her boy is going. She would do anything, in fact, but lead a decent\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nMiss Fleming is still in Rome. She belongs to the modern school which\r\nregards the nice reproduction of drapery and dry goods as the highest art.\r\nShe sends home pictures, which sometimes gain a place by sufferance in a\r\ndark corner at the spring exhibition.\r\n\r\nMr. Neckart once bought one, a _Lady's Toilette_.\r\n\r\n\"A fair specimen of the millinery cult,\" he said, showing it to Judge\r\nRhodes, \"Poor Cornelia! Why is it that she never, even by chance, paints a\r\nclean-minded woman?\" He sent a cheque for double the price asked for it.\r\nBut he threw the picture on the market again, not wishing to take it home.\r\nHe had married a singularly clean-minded woman.\r\n\r\nCornelia's first impulse was to send the cheque back. But, instead, she\r\nbought a ring with a single costly ruby in it, and has worn it ever since,\r\nthough she has been hungry for bread many a time. Hungry or not, she makes\r\nher studio one of the pleasantest resorts for the young artists in Rome.\r\nShe has cut her hair short, wears a jaunty velvet coat and man's collar:\r\nher arms are bony, but she bares them, and still shoots languishing glances\r\nfrom out of the crowsfeet. The young men laugh to each other. \"A good\r\nfellow, Corny,\" they say, \"but what a pity that she is not a man!\"\r\n\r\nThe Home for Friendless Children is at last a reality in New York, though\r\nVan Ness is not a director. It was established by the editor Neckart, whose\r\nwife, it is said, endowed it with her own fortune. This charitable deed\r\nleft them with but a very moderate competency. Neckart managed to buy in\r\nthe Hemlock Farm, out of his income, for her and the boy.\r\n\r\nHe drives them over once a week to see the children in the Home, each of\r\nwhom Jane knows and tries to spoil.\r\n\r\n\"You are glad that we made this act of reparation, Jane?\" he said to her\r\none day.\r\n\r\n\"Reparation?\" She hesitated, and then said, \"I know that I made many\r\nmistakes when I was a law to myself. You are my law now, Bruce.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are satisfied that it was right to give back the money?\" he\r\ninsisted.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course! The money was unlucky! It made you uncomfortable too. And I\r\nlook on it as a free gift from Swendon here to the poor little babies,\"\r\ntaking her boy on her knee and stroking his curls. \"But,\" she added in a\r\nlow voice, \"the money was mine. I was quite right when I burned the will.\"\r\n\r\nNeckart laughed good-humoredly, and touched the horses with his whip. There\r\nis no man living who loves his wife more tenderly; and Jane is the most\r\nsimple and prosaic of women. Yet there are times when she seems, even to\r\nhim, a woman whose acquaintance he has scarcely made, and whom he can never\r\nhope to know better.\r\n\r\nREBECCA HARDING DAVIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUIDA'S NOVELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a number of years the novels of Ouida have been the delight of their\r\nreaders and the scorn and laughing stock of reviewers. Every new volume\r\nthat has appeared has given a thrill of occasionally guilty delight to\r\nthose whose studies are confined to the shelves of the circulating library,\r\nwhile critics have beaten the air with their attacks against this writer's\r\nfrequent coarseness of tone, her hodge-podge of learning, and the superfine\r\nelegance which makes the air of most of her stories so heavy and\r\nenervating. Nothing could show more thoroughly the futility of criticism\r\nthan the powerlessness of all the evil-minded notices of her many books.\r\nThe reviewer may have spoken words of wisdom that would have honored\r\nSolomon, but the public did not care how inaccurate Ouida's Latin\r\nquotations and classical references were: they were entertained by her\r\nnovels, and disregarded him who denounced her, just as those who are\r\nrunning to a house where they will hear music, breathe perfumes and see\r\nfine dresses pass by the hungry man who stands outside shaking his fist and\r\ngrowling at pleasure-seekers. People who are anxious to waltz do not care\r\nto stop and discuss with political economists the advisability of giving up\r\nluxuries, nor to hear the band begin the best of Beethoven's symphonies:\r\nthey want to hear the opening notes of one of Strauss's compositions. The\r\nsame love of amusement is at the root of all novel-reading--unless indeed\r\nit be a feeling of social duty which brings so many readers to George\r\nEliot's novels--and Ouida is pretty sure to give her admirers a full dose\r\nof highly-seasoned entertainment which cannot fail to please unsensitive\r\npalates.\r\n\r\nThe materials with which she brews her fiery and somewhat heady draughts\r\nare almost monotonously alike. Her heroes are beauteous, long-limbed,\r\nsilky-haired, graceful men: if the scene is laid in England, they are\r\ngenerally officers, always of high family and terribly dissipated. Beneath\r\na quiet, courteous demeanor they hide passionate feeling, indomitable\r\nbravery and great capacity for friendship. They are adorned by every vice,\r\nand are consequently loved by every woman. As for the women, who except\r\nOuida can describe them? They are faultlessly beautiful, exceedingly\r\nheadstrong and full of fascinating peccadilloes. Next to the _beaux\r\nsabreurs_ come the gifted artists, and alongside of the wicked ladies of\r\nrank appear the ladies without rank, but with every other charm of the\r\nsinful sort. Brandy and soda, hock and seltzer and cigarettes almost\r\ndeserve mention among the _dramatis personae_: they serve to delight her\r\naristocracy, and for the aristocracy Ouida has a most plebeian esteem. Its\r\nfaults are virtues in disguise: gambling away a large fortune in a night is\r\nheroism; faithlessness in love is its first duty; anything like decorum is\r\nthe most \"caddish\" Philistinism. These being Ouida's literary principles,\r\nand also the delight of her readers, it is easy to see how absolutely\r\nuseless would be any solemn attempt to prove that there is anything good in\r\nthe world except wickedness. Ouida has pages of pseudo-rhythmical soliloquy\r\nin which she alleges the truth of her statements about lords and ladies,\r\nbut, whether true or false, there is a charm to her readers in her flowery\r\naccount of what their social betters do. Scandal never fails of a listener,\r\nand who can serve such huge banquets of scandal as will Ouida at a moment's\r\nnotice? She offers no mere crumb that has dropped from a rich table, but a\r\nmass that concerns every duke and duchess and earl and countess in the\r\npeerage. Victor Hugo has taught a docile generation the power of the\r\nmelodrama, and Ouida, an apt pupil, has written in English the most violent\r\nprotests against human beings as they are, and has encouraged the use of\r\nexaggeration in the representation of life. She employs the much-abused\r\nmethod of contrast. She draws a man who is stained with every vice, and to\r\noutweigh his crying faults she makes him tell the truth under difficult\r\ncircumstances, or keep a promise, or possibly do a generous action, and the\r\nreader, who has admired the hero at his worst, thrills with fervent pride\r\nin his colossal right-doing at last.\r\n\r\nThe air of worldly wisdom with which her books are filled is another\r\npowerful attraction. Persons who know so much about wickedness must have,\r\nit would seem, a rare knowledge of human life and human beings; and the\r\npoor reader, whose worst notion of vice is working embroidery on Sunday,\r\nhas forced down her throat stenographic reports of the talk in demireps'\r\nparlors, with occasional interludes in which the author charges her critics\r\nwith squeamishness for objecting to her parade on the dung-hills of life.\r\nBut it is useless to make too much mention of her faults. She is like most\r\nof the writers who reject all limitations and say they must describe people\r\nas they are, and then seek in the mire for people to write about.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the question of the impropriety which taints by no means all\r\nher work, it is well to find what constitutes her power in other\r\ndirections. She has a large following, and many who utterly condemn her\r\ngross faults are very anxious to read her new books as fast as they appear.\r\nIn the first place, she has a good deal of real power. It is not accuracy,\r\nor refinement, or the accomplishment of much by moderate means, but a great\r\naccumulation of effective points, that carries the reader through her\r\nbooks. It is not a man whom she takes for a hero, but a picturesque\r\ncombination of attractive failings, united with an impossible beauty and\r\ngrace. It is a vulgar ideal that she worships, and it is vulgarer in fact\r\nthan as she sees it; but she worships it with positive adoration, and she\r\nwarms the reader with something of her own fervor. She is in earnest, and\r\nshe has the gift of expression, often of tawdry, bombastic expression, but\r\noften powerful and impressive.\r\n\r\nTake _Chandos_, for instance: it is the melodrama run mad. Chandos belongs\r\nto one of the best families in England; he has genius in all directions; he\r\nwrites books that sell as only very good and very poor books sell; he is as\r\nbeautiful as the figures that adorn tailors' patterns; his wealth seems\r\nboundless; in immorality Don Juan was but a blundering schoolboy by his\r\nside. This cold description does him no manner of justice: any one who\r\nknows Ouida's novels will readily recall the type, and he stands head and\r\nshoulders above the rest. He warms a snake in his bosom in the guise of a\r\nfriend, who manages his affairs and leads the lordly Chandos to total\r\nbankruptcy. The languid voluptuary goes out into the world and knows every\r\nkind of suffering: at length, twenty years afterward, he is restored to his\r\nrights, and by a magnanimous effort he pardons the treacherous friend, who,\r\nhe finds, is his illegitimate brother, and all ends well. But the reader's\r\nfeelings are reached in a way that no one would suspect from this meagre\r\nstatement. Chandos lives in halls of porphyry, and does everything for the\r\nman who betrays him; he is absolutely above suspicion, just as the other\r\nman is without a scrap of virtue or kindliness; and the contrast between\r\nhis high and his low estate is done in black and white, with lights and\r\nshadows as distinct as if the book had been written under a calcium flame.\r\nThat the book has considerable crude force cannot be denied even by those\r\nwho are ready to sneer most loudly at its glaring faults. By dint of\r\nexaggerating virtues and vices the author dulls for a time the inevitable\r\nrevolt of the reader against such unnatural representations of life. This\r\nstory--or it may be other readers have been struck by some other of the\r\nseries--impresses itself upon the memory for a time, just as a play would\r\nin which we seem to see a man jump out of a third-story window, but in both\r\ncases we should be inclined to question the author's respect for\r\nliterature. All such work is like scene-painting, but if a man prefers\r\ngazing at chromo-lithographs to visiting the Pitti Gallery, he cannot be\r\ntalked out of his tastes.\r\n\r\nThe reaction against realism shows itself now-a-days in many curious ways.\r\nAlongside of an intense devotion to science there flourishes the vulgarest\r\nsuperstition regarding the occupations and intellectual capacity of\r\ndeparted spirits, and the imagination of the present day finds its frequent\r\nexpression in coarse melodrama. But even for the melodrama Ouida, clever as\r\nshe is, lacks one important element--namely, a sense of humor. There is a\r\nmonotonous seriousness in her stories, and frequently an unrelieved pathos,\r\nwhich is in direct violation of the law that commands grotesqueness and\r\nmisery to be put in close antithesis by the writer who is anxious to win\r\nfame. The airy _badinage_ of some of her characters is singularly void of\r\nlightness and frolicsomeness. Their unfailing cynicism alone makes good\r\nthis noticeable deficiency. This fault distinguishes Ouida very clearly\r\nfrom Dumas and Victor Hugo, for Dumas's high spirits seldom failed him,\r\nwhile Victor Hugo combines contrasting qualities in his novel as carefully\r\nas if he were making a salad. But Ouida can relieve the strain she makes\r\nupon her readers' feelings only by a profuse display of worldly wisdom.\r\nEvery-day experience shows that vulgar, unrelieved cynicism is an\r\neasily-learned accomplishment: any credulous person, inclined to gossip and\r\nashamed of being thought decorous, can be hand and glove with Ouida in a\r\nvery short time, although it is by no means every one who out of such\r\ntawdry material can weave a story that shall be generally interesting. The\r\ndouble nature of this writer is an instance of a rather rare combination.\r\nShe can be as vulgar as a gossiping dressmaker with a keen love of scandal,\r\nand yet she has a vein of poetical sensitiveness, of strong feeling, which\r\nstands in strange contrast with her heavy-handed cynicism. In fact, she\r\ngilds in her own fashion the crudest display of coarseness and selfishness.\r\nPossibly it is too much to say that she _gilds_: she hangs round with\r\ntinsel all sorts of subjects, over which she rejoices as a raw schoolboy\r\nrejoices over his first cigar; and this with an infantile delight in her\r\nown _savoir vivre_ and an ecstatic vain-glory in her faults which throw\r\nreal merits into the shade.\r\n\r\nA melodramatic imagination--by which is meant a proneness to look at things\r\nas Ouida looks at them, an inclination to see crude picturesqueness of\r\neffect--apparently fills its owner or victim with the most puffed-up pride.\r\nAnything like moderation or exactness is despised, good workmanship is\r\nregarded as the plodding of stupidity, and all chance of cultivating what\r\ntalents the writer may have is thrown over to find place for strong effect.\r\nAll of Ouida's desultory reading seems to have taught her nothing except\r\nthat by heaping up agonizing incidents a point will be reached at last when\r\neven the most hardened reader will have to succumb and give his sympathy to\r\nmuch-persecuted innocence or to fascinating guilt; and her power of\r\ninventing harrowing scenes is practically unlimited. So many writers are\r\ncold and unlifelike that Ouida's exaggeration seems to many a most\r\npardonable fault, so far indeed as it seems to be a fault. Her perpetual\r\nreferences to the classics probably appear to the ignorant reader like the\r\nprofoundest lore: her chatter about French literature, especially about\r\nbooks seldom discussed in mixed company, furthers this delusion. Indeed, it\r\nis pitiable to go through one of her novels and pick out the rubbish she\r\ncollects and sets in order for the delight of an eager public. Here are\r\nsome gems from _In a Winter City_. The present condition of Florence,\r\ndisguised as Floralia, is thus compared with its past glories: \"It is\r\nBelisarius turned croupier to a gaming-table; it is Caesar selling cigars\r\nand newspapers; it is Apelles drawing for the _Albums pour Rire_; it is\r\nPindar rhyming the couplets for _Fleur de The_; it is Praxiteles designing\r\ncostumes for a calico ball; it is Phidias forming the poses of a ballet.\"\r\nThat gem is on the first page of the book, which is more like a tenth-rate\r\nFrench novel than any English story that has appeared for some time.\r\n\r\nHere are a few lines from _Chandos_, describing the revels of the\r\naristocracy in a \"summer villa at Richmond belonging to him [the hero, of\r\ncourse], where most of these Bohemian dinners and suppers _a la Regence_\r\nwere given--a charming place, half covered in flowering trees and pyramids\r\nof May blossoms,... with the daintiest and cosiest banqueting-room in the\r\nworld, hung with scarlet silk, drawn back here and there to show some\r\nbeautiful picture by Titian, Greuze, Regnault or La Tour; large enough to\r\nhold twenty people, but small enough to fill _a huis clos_ like a cabinet;\r\nwith the air scented by dreamy incenses and dishes and wines under the\r\nmellowed light that would have entranced even Lucullus had he been throned\r\nthere on his ivory chair....\r\n\r\n\"'The art of life is--to enjoy!' cried Chandos that night, lifting up to\r\ncrown the sentiment a deep glass of glowing red Roussillon.\r\n\r\n\"'Toast worthy of Lucullus and Ovid! and you are a master of the science,'\r\nsaid John Trevenna, who was perhaps the only one who saw quite clearly\r\nthrough that intoxicating atmosphere of pastilles, and perfumes, and wines,\r\nand crushed flowers, and bruised fruits, and glancing tresses, and languid\r\neyes, and lips fit for the hymns of a Catullus.\r\n\r\n\"'He is the darling of the gods!' cried Flora de l'Orme, that magnificent\r\nArlesienne, with her melting, Greek-like glance, and her cheek like a peach\r\nin the sun, while she leaned over him and twisted, Catullus-like, in the\r\nbright masses of his long, golden hair a wreath of crimson roses washed in\r\npurple Burgundy.\"\r\n\r\nProbably, if the pink-cheeked beauties on glove- and handkerchief-boxes\r\ncould be filled with the breath of life, and be set down in a land of which\r\nthe only authentic representations are those on a drop-curtain, this is the\r\nway they would talk and act; and the same refined taste that goes to the\r\npainting of such figures and scenery is manifested in the production of\r\nsuch literature as makes up the bulk of many of Ouida's novels.\r\n\r\nAnd yet a writer who so handicaps herself with vulgarity and actual\r\nindecency and the grossest snobbishness has underneath that unattractive\r\nvarnish a fervent passion that is at least impressive. While revelling in\r\nsuch scenes as made the notoriety of the author of _Guy Livingstone_, she\r\nhas touches of real pathos, over-wrought possibly, but cold in comparison\r\nwith her absurdest writings. In _Signa_, for instance, the whole story of\r\nBruno's love for his betrayed sister's child has certain elements of\r\nfineness which atone for much of the rubbish swept into some of Ouida's\r\nearlier novels. The book is not one for the Sunday-school library, nor will\r\nany one be injured by not reading it, but there is more ability in it than\r\none will find in a great many books by more discreetly-admired writers. It\r\nis a romance of a kind not over common in English fiction, and it forms a\r\ngrateful change from the arid records of the cool love-making of English\r\ncurates and home-bred young women as sung by this writer's contemporaries.\r\nThe book has the faults that surely mark an untrained writer, but there is\r\nnothing petty in it: indeed, there is a generous breadth of treatment which\r\nshows most strongly how Ouida's natural gifts, which had been wasted by\r\nglorifying club-talk and midnight suppers, blossomed forth under the\r\ninfluence of Italy. She was possessed by its charm, and inspired by it to\r\nput all her new feeling into this story of passion. There is no trace of\r\nthe confining bounds that had previously kept her busy turning over\r\nunworthy material: she spoke out boldly; and if this is not a great book,\r\nit is at least a book with some of the qualities of greatness in it.\r\nIndeed, it is of a sort that makes one regret that the author had not been\r\nexposed to more favorable influences: wiser blame and more temperate praise\r\nmight possibly have freed her from the faults that show their head even\r\nhere much more than is desirable. But what is fine in it is something no\r\none could have taught her--the sympathy with ambitious youth, the struggle\r\nfor fame on the part of the hero, his uncle's stern nature, and the\r\ncleverness with which some of the lesser characters are drawn: all these\r\nthings, which are to be found beneath the facile sing-song of the prose and\r\nthe perpetual exaggeration of everything good as well as of everything bad,\r\nare surely the proof of rare original power. Her very excellence at times\r\nserves but to make the reader impatient with her faults, which more than\r\nanything are _vulgar_; and genius and vulgarity do not agree well.\r\n\r\nBut her good qualities are best seen in some of her short stories, and most\r\nof all in those collected in a single volume entitled _Leaf in the Storm,\r\nand Other Stories_, the others being entitled \"A Dog of Flanders,\" \"A\r\nBranch of Lilac,\" and \"A Provence Rose;\" all of which first appeared in\r\n_Lippincott's Magazine_. These are free from the faults of taste which so\r\ngenerally mar her work, although at times the reader comes on exaggerated\r\ntouches which lessen rather than intensify the pathos; but on the whole it\r\nis impossible not to admire, and to admire warmly, the author's power.\r\nOuida here shows her true feeling, and feeling is not over-abundant in\r\ncontemporary fiction. There is plenty of acute observation, clever\r\ndescription and more or less good-natured satire, but all these things are\r\nslight and meagre by the side of strong and genuine feeling. The greatest\r\nnovel-writer will combine both, and will not sacrifice one to the other;\r\nbut only too often Ouida throws aside actual and imaginary probability for\r\nthe sake of melodramatic effect. Of these short tales just mentioned, the\r\none giving its name to the book and \"A Branch of Lilac\" are especially to\r\nbe mentioned with respect, and they justify almost any amount of wrath on\r\nthe part of the reader with the author's excessive abuse of her gifts. In\r\nher reaction against conventionality and everything that is humdrum she\r\ncontinually falls into worse pitfalls, but here she is really tragic and\r\nreally pathetic. In three of these tales she draws the sufferings of\r\nstruggling genius, which she is fond of describing, though she has never\r\ndone it so well as here; and in two of them, \"A Dog of Flanders\" and \"A\r\nProvence Rose,\" she combines in the story unusual ingredients, one being\r\ntold by a rose that witnesses the incidents, while in the other the dog's\r\nfeelings are set forth at great length. This is always a difficult thing to\r\ndo; and it is to be noticed that in both disguises we find Ouida under\r\nother names, but yet there is enough that is touching in the treatment to\r\ndispel harsh criticism. This is not the only time that Ouida has introduced\r\nthis transmigration of souls into her books, for _Puck_ is a story told by\r\na dog, but unfortunately the dog has the author's ineradicable preference\r\nfor low company, and a sort of nineteenth-century Moll Flanders has an\r\nundue prominence in the book. _Bebee_, on the other hand, reminds the\r\nreader of the innocent short tales: it is a charming little story without\r\nthe ambitious tawdriness of the longer romances. _In a Winter City_, again,\r\nreeks with fashionable follies and is written in Ouida's most approved\r\nworst style.\r\n\r\n_Ariadne_, the latest of her novels, shows in many ways a marked\r\nimprovement over her earlier work. The story is an admirably invented one:\r\nalmost every incident is of course crammed with pathos, while the main plot\r\nis exceedingly touching. It is supposed to be narrated by an accomplished\r\nRoman cobbler, who is a sound critic of art as well as an expert repairer\r\nof shoes. He comes across one day a young girl of great beauty who has been\r\nwonderfully educated in the classics by her father, and who now, after her\r\nparent's death, has come to Rome to find her grandfather, a miserly Jew.\r\nThis unnatural grandfather drives her from his door, and the cobbler,\r\nfinding her in great misery, offers her his room, when she at once falls\r\nsick, while he lives in his stall. When she has recovered she begins to\r\ncarve statues--her father had been a sculptor--and these coming to the\r\nsight of a great French artist, Maryx by name, he makes her his pupil.\r\nGradually her teacher comes to love her, but there appears on the stage a\r\ngreat poet, Hilarion--there is never any lack of greatness in these\r\nnovels--who is faultlessly beautiful and whom every woman infalliby loves\r\nat sight. Of course, Ariadne is not an exception, so that one day Maryx and\r\nthe cobbler are surprised to find that Hilarion and she have run away\r\ntogether. It would be unnecessary to describe the book too closely from\r\nthis point: it is enough to say that Hilarion soon wearies of her, while\r\nshe never changes in her feeling toward him. When she is deserted in Paris\r\nthe cobbler goes there and brings her back to Rome, when Maryx learns again\r\nthe hopelessness of his love, and later Hilarion shoots him in a duel.\r\nAfter a time Ariadne dies broken-hearted, just as Hilarion has learned\r\nreally to love her, so that he survives to mourn hopelessly the evil he has\r\ndone. However this may sound in a cold abstract, it cannot be denied that\r\nthe reader receives a deep impression of the tragedy which is the subject\r\nof the book. Ouida never fails to supply the tragic element in great\r\nabundance, but here it is given us not on the writer's mere assertion, but\r\nwith such exposition of the characters as marks some of her later stories,\r\nbut is perhaps more prominent here than elsewhere. The heroine, for\r\ninstance, is well drawn: her intensity and purity, and indeed her genius,\r\nare all clearly brought before the reader. It is something rare to conceive\r\nsuch a character, but it is infinitely rarer to find any definite image of\r\nit conveyed by a writer to any one else. To be sure, this is done with a\r\ngreat waste of purple ink, but yet there are touches which indicate not\r\npower alone, but also that acuteness of observation and intelligent\r\nknowledge of method which are needed to give even great power its value.\r\nMaryx too is well represented, and everywhere, even when the captious would\r\ncomplain of too much melodrama, there are scenes and bits of talk that are\r\ngood because they are natural. In time justice will be done to the ability\r\nof a writer who, when the short-hand report of talk over tea-cups was the\r\nfashion, was able to rise above such mechanical handiwork and write a story\r\nfull of passion. Faulty, tawdry and theatrical as much of Ouida's writing\r\nis, she does know--and knowing she at times describes--genuine passion, as\r\nshe has done here. Much as she has spun out the tale, it is a fine one, and\r\nan admirable example of her best side. The revenge that Ariadne makes in\r\ncarving a statue of Hilarion as he seemed to her, so that even he felt some\r\nshame at his inferiority to her conception of him, is impressive. The way,\r\ntoo, in which Rome is kept as a background for all the events described is\r\nworthy of notice. But here as elsewhere the main fault is this, which is\r\nbest described in her own characteristic language: \"How one wishes that\r\nthey had told us the fate of Nausicaa! When she leaned against the pillar\r\nand bade her farewell to the great wanderer, we know her heart was heavy:\r\nnever again could she play by the shore glad-hearted with her maidens: when\r\nshe had passed, that day, out between the silver dogs of Hephaestus, through\r\nthe west wind and the pomegranate-blossoms, to the sea, she had left her\r\nhappy youth behind her. So much we feel sure of, but we would fain know\r\nmore. Were it a modern poem, how it would be amplified! how much we should\r\nhear of her conflict of silence and sorrow! No modern would have the\r\ncoldness to leave her there, leaning against the column in Alcinoeus's hall,\r\nand never add a word of her fate. But that is our weakness: we cannot\r\n'break off the laurel-bough' shortly and sharply, unburnt, as they did of\r\nold.\"\r\n\r\nNot only is she unable to \"break off the laurel-bough:\" she decks it with\r\ngewgaws and tinsel; she sets the reader's teeth on edge with references to\r\nthe \"Scipii\" and to the \"gens Quintilii,\" and never lets pass a chance to\r\nbring some bit of ancient or mediaeval Roman history into the story, which\r\nis also weighed down with superfluous sentiment. It would be hard to find a\r\nwriter more affected by the \"weakness\" of redundant description and\r\nexpression. Then, too, the glorification of all her characters, her way of\r\ngiving them unlimited wealth, beauty or genius, is like that play of the\r\nimagination of children which they exhibit by talking of the time when they\r\nwill be rich and will give one another hundreds of thousands of dollars.\r\nEvery one of the longer novels is marred by this fictitious extravagance:\r\nit is in her short stories alone that she manages to touch the earth, and\r\nin them her pathos is genuine and direct.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SERGEANT PERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA KENTUCKY DUEL.\r\n\r\nTWO PARTS.--II.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nWhen Walter Brown heard of the delicacy of his clerk in keeping the name of\r\nhis family out of that foolish altercation, and saw the masterly summary he\r\nhad made of the business confided to his hand, the bold operator in pork\r\nrecognized a value in his clerk. To his remonstrances Bob said, \"It's a\r\nclosed account, sir, and I must pay the balances. If I let the police\r\ninterfere, I shall have a dozen rows on hand, and could not manage the\r\nroughs in the yard.\"\r\n\r\nBut, though Mr. Brown saw that he could not interfere without injuring\r\nBob's reputation, he resolved that she who had made the quarrel should stop\r\nit. He sent the dowager, packed with her prejudices, to the police\r\nmagistrate. \"Hold up your hand. You swear L. B. Mason, Esq., and ----\r\nNettles contemplate a breach of the peace?\" said the judge.\r\n\r\n\"I can't swear of my own knowledge,\" said she. \"It is incredible a nettles\r\n\"--with a small _n_--\"should meet a Brown,\" with a four-line pica _B_. And\r\nit did seem incredible to the august dowager.\r\n\r\n\"Really, madam, we have nothing to found a warrant upon,\" said the\r\ncourt.--\"Show the lady out, and call the next case.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, as decided in _Ex-parte Jones_, the right of personal redress was\r\nrecognized by law in Kentucky, and an elective judiciary cared neither to\r\nignore nor acknowledge the case. But in going out she heard a policeman\r\nmake some reference to the duel in conversing with a comrade.\r\n\r\n\"Of what were you speaking just now?\" asked the dowager.\r\n\r\n\"Of a little game between a low-down dead-beat and a gent,\" said the\r\npoliceman.\r\n\r\n\"If I understand you,\" said the dowager, \"I am glad to find such correct\r\nfeeling in men of your class.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's so on the Force,\" said the man. \"Short-stop is quite a favo-rite\r\nwith the tip-toppers. You may ha' heerd o' him. T'other's a sort o'\r\nstool-pigeon--name Mason. They do say as a rich aunt o' his'n got him into\r\nit. Blest if she'll get much of him out of it when Nettles is done with\r\nhim! Why, Nettles beats professionals!--Now, boy, you going to drive your\r\nmissis' carriage, or shall I? This ain't no place to scrouge about and\r\nstare.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Fanny sank back astounded. Was she a Moabitish mother who had\r\nsacrificed her nephew to a professional duellist? \"Drive to Lawyer\r\nWinnett's,\" she said--\"quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your information was sufficient,\" said the lawyer with that contempt the\r\nprofession has for irregular police proceedings, \"but the code is a bastard\r\nchild of the law. If you had a warrant the officers would not execute it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the dowager, brought face to face with a family prejudice in\r\nfavor of the code, \"it is too horrible to suppose that peace-officers will\r\nstand coolly by and see homicide contemplated and executed without\r\ninterference.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, nevertheless,\" said the lawyer, too familiar with contradictions of\r\nthe law to regard it. \"But, in fact, I wished to speak to you of your\r\nnephew's affairs. Captain Mason sent a schedule of his liabilities this\r\nmorning, saying you had authorized their settlement. I don't regard Captain\r\nMason's stories usually, but there was something about a family marriage\r\nincluded, which, knowing your wishes, I think justifies me in referring to\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wretch!\" said his aunt. \"I have authorized nothing of the kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"No? Well, excuse my reference to it. It just occurred to me if such an\r\narrangement was contemplated we might kill two birds with one stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" asked the dowager. \"I want this atrocious duel stopped. The rabble\r\nhave my name mixed in it, as if I counselled or approved. I am shocked at\r\nit, and it must be stopped at any cost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said the lawyer, his professional coolness contrasting with\r\nthe dowager's fierce temper. \"I might buy up Captain Mason's notes in the\r\nhands of Walker or Levi, and have him arrested in civil proceedings as\r\nabout to leave the State to avoid his creditors. That writ would go into\r\nthe hands of the sheriff, and I do not doubt its execution. Captain Mason's\r\ncredit is such at present he cannot find security. If necessary, I could\r\nput on some others,\" looking over the schedule. \"I have no doubt it will\r\nhold him until the matter is stopped. If you instruct me to that effect,\r\nyou can go home, madam, and leave it to me.\"\r\n\r\nHow refreshing it was to meet a practical, sound head in all that\r\nconfusion! Much relieved, Aunt Fanny hurried home to comfort Sudie, just\r\nwakened to grief by her father's visit.\r\n\r\nThe dowager's appreciation of the shrewd lawyer's hypothesis was heightened\r\nalmost immediately by a visit from Wylde Payne with a note from her nephew\r\nsoliciting pecuniary assistance. The dowager fairly clapped her hands. It\r\nbegan to assume all the interest of a race or a match game at whist. \"We\r\nshall take every trick, child,\" said she; \"and this Mister Payne, my\r\noverseer's grandson, who made all this trouble, shall be laid by the heels\r\nto begin with.\"\r\n\r\nShe kept him in the anteroom while she despatched a swift messenger to her\r\nlawyer asking for a policeman to take Payne into custody. Lind Mason's\r\nsecond, it will be observed, had had every assurance that his principal was\r\nfighting his aunt's quarrel, and looked for no small share of commendation\r\nfor his own zeal and services. He had time to hear the regular movements of\r\na great household revolving about the pivotal dinner-hour before he rang a\r\nsecond time. Then the mulatto maid, Memmie, appeared: \"This way, sah. Yalla\r\nMemmie done knowed ye when ye could tie you'se'f in a cawnah o' yo'\r\npock't-hankchah and put yo'se'f in yo' pock't.\"\r\n\r\nPondering on such precocious jugglery of his early years, he was ushered\r\ninto the dowager's boudoir, where she sat with Sudie and ma'amselle.\r\n\r\n\"Be seated, Mr. Payne,\" she said with that royal gesture of command\r\nhabitual to power in her sphere. \"I am glad to see you. You are at the\r\nbottom of this bloody business.\"\r\n\r\nPayne took breath as from a sudden douche, and began a speech conned over\r\nin the carriage: \"In a crisis involving the honor of a noble family--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know the false and criminal jargon by which you justify your barbarous\r\ncode,\" interrupted the haughty dowager. \"It lacks that manly directness I\r\nrequire in all who address me. Why, sir, did you avail yourself of a\r\nquick-tempered old woman's hasty words to force her wretched nephew into\r\nwicked folly? How dared you intercept my messenger?\" sharply, as if at a\r\nnew and sudden offence just sprung.\r\n\r\nAll this was astounding to Payne as the caresses of a tigress; but his too\r\nwas a bold, high temper when aroused, and he retorted: \"Madam, if you\r\ndesire your nephew to be kicked and cuffed and driven from his cousin's\r\nhouse, it cannot be as Wylde Payne's friend. Your messenger was excluded by\r\nCaptain Mason's orders, he having matters more important in hand than the\r\nintermeddling of a lady who had forced him into this business, but who now\r\nmakes a merit of deserting him and abusing those who decline to act as\r\ntreacherously.\"\r\n\r\nThe hot shot went home to the magazine, for the dowager rose blazing: \"I\r\nknow you for murder's lackey, and the cheap notoriety you seek, at the cost\r\nof your friend's courage and life, as the witness of his assassination,\r\nready to testify it was well and fairly done--the base policeman of murder,\r\nto guard guilt in its guiltiness as the law protects the innocent in\r\ninnocency. But you shall not escape: mark that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am responsible for my actions and easy to find,\" said Payne. \"I scorn a\r\nlaw that presumes to enter into my feelings and judge the measure of my\r\nwounded honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weigh your words well,\" said the dowager--\"you who presume to sit in\r\njudgment on the honor of a Brown! Public opinion is ripe to break the\r\nshackles of this vile code. No mail of chivalry protects the second who\r\nstands coolly by, a participant and accessory without risk or danger, to\r\njustify the black murder done on his bosom friend. When wealth and social\r\ninfluence are thrown into the scale against one who caught up a rash\r\nwoman's hasty word, as hastily repented, we shall know what the law thinks\r\nof one who excluded her messenger of peace and pressed his victim on to the\r\nmurdering-ground.\"\r\n\r\nAngry as she was, the old lady was putting her points well. Payne's\r\nposition was already very equivocal. Common rumor presented him as forcing\r\nthat Boabdil Mason to the mark; but he answered contemptuously, \"You have\r\nalready appealed to the law, and know the result.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" interrupted the dowager, crumpling the lawyer's unread note in her\r\nhand. \"You will find your friend's quarters in the Louisville jail, and a\r\npoliceman at the door to escort you to him.\"\r\n\r\nPayne rose hastily and left the room without ceremony.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, aunty!\" said little Sue, who had listened to the roar of great guns in\r\nawe and terror, \"it will make you sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sick!\" said the dowager, looking almost real in her affected youth with\r\ncongenial excitement: \"it is life, child. But let us see what Winnett\r\nsays.\"\r\n\r\nBefore reading the lawyer's note let us follow Payne. The reader will\r\nunderstand that Mason was now in the condition of Ivanhoe after his wager\r\nwith the Templar of the precious reliquary, and before he was relieved by\r\nthe gratitude of Isaac of York. He lacked the means to get to his Ashby de\r\nla Zouche. But at Payne's rueful face in telling of his interview with the\r\ndowager the graceless scamp threw his fat figure on the bed, cracking his\r\nsides with laughter.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see the fun,\" said Payne sulkily. \"I wish I was well out of it.\r\nThe dowager talked devilish strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"If my aunt won't help us,\" said Mason, \"my uncle will. You must just take\r\nmy stop-watch to the three balls.\r\n\r\n    Farewell to my golden repeater!\r\n    We've come to my uncle's old shop!\"\r\n\r\nPayne was just leaving when a voice in the next room stopped him. \"It's\r\nthat infernal pawnbroker,\" said he in a rage.\r\n\r\nThe man came in, smooth, civil, obsequious. \"I thought you'd like to have\r\nthis thing off your mind,\" said he, presenting a note of Mason's.\r\n\r\nThe two looked at each other blankly.\r\n\r\n\"See here, Levison,\" said Mason coaxingly: \"you know my aunt will settle\r\nall these things, and I want money right now. Payne was just going to see\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"She'll pay some--not this,\" said the man coolly. \"In fact, I am just from\r\nWinnett's. He has paid Levi and Walker\"--at which Mason stared--\"and taken\r\nout a writ in summary proceedings. In fact, I come to warn you, and one\r\ngood turn deserves another: pay it and go.\"\r\n\r\nMason by chaffering got a small sum on his watch over the debt. He was\r\nclear at last. Payne had left, and Mason was taking a final drink at the\r\nbar when a man tapped his shoulder. Aunt Fanny had played her trump and\r\nwon: it was the sheriff.\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" said Levison, laughing. \"Whenever you _have_ anything, you\r\nknow, I am accommodating, but--\"\r\n\r\nWe can now return and read Aunt Fanny's correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWhen the lawyer's note, by anticipation, announced the arrest described in\r\nthe last chapter, Aunt Fanny, like an old spirit of the turf, began to\r\ngroom for that other match. I declare it was not an unlovely sight to see\r\nthe two women, youth and its affectation, wrapping arms about each other in\r\njoyous mood over this double victory.\r\n\r\nThe dowager took occasion to praise her nephew's gallantry, the chivalry\r\nthat prompted him to take up an old woman's quarrel, with hints that the\r\nother party, even if his rhymes had been unintentional, betrayed a rudeness\r\nthat ill became the Vere de Vere. Perhaps this part, as it included little\r\nSue, had as well have been left out, but Aunt Fanny had her points to make,\r\nand always played a bold, high game.\r\n\r\nAs the two sang paeans of victory another note came from the lawyer, which\r\nquite altered the complexion of things. That ready gamester, Lind Mason,\r\nhad played again and completely turned the tables on Aunt Fanny, using her\r\nown weapons to wrench victory from her:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR MRS. BROWN: I regret to say your nephew and his accomplice Levison\r\nhave played us a scoundrelly trick. Levison came to me and proposed to bail\r\nyour nephew. Not knowing the parties were in collusion, and satisfied that\r\nyour nephew was in the sheriff's custody, I tried to put Levison off. But\r\nhe told me coolly that he knew my object was to detain Captain Mason--that\r\nif I had taken up his first note for fifty dollars, he might have let this\r\nother one for two hundred and fifty alone; but he must take care of\r\nhimself. He intended to bail every writ until his claim was taken up. If I\r\nchose to assume all the captain's liabilities first, very well, but it was\r\nin my discretion to secure him first. No one else would try the same bold\r\ngame. Under your instructions, which were peremptory, I had no choice but\r\nto accept the offer; which I did. There was necessarily a minute's interval\r\nin preparing the new writ on Levison's claim, which I sued out at once,\r\nCaptain Mason and the sheriff being in the room, and your nephew\r\nacquiescing in the arrangement, as I thought. But he stepped out: the\r\nsheriff went instantly in pursuit by my directions, but with unexampled\r\neffrontery Captain Mason demanded by what authority he was detained. Of\r\ncourse, as, technically speaking, the writ of arrest was not yet served,\r\nthe sheriff could do nothing, and Mason taking the streetcar, the minute's\r\ninterval of returning for the writ allowed him to get off. The sheriff has\r\ngone to the ferry and put officers at the bridge and elsewhere, but it is\r\nimpossible yet to know the result.\r\n\r\n\"We must now seize the other party. I have heard of one Joe Skinner, who\r\ncould testify certainly to the contemplated breach of the peace by Mr.\r\nNettles. If there was any way to detain that gentleman an hour, until the\r\nlawyer could get his hands on Skinner!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Humph! detain Mr. Nettles!\" said the dowager, glancing from the lawyer's\r\nnote to the pale, pretty face before her. \"You look pale, child: a drive\r\nwill help you.--Memmie, have the double racing-buggy and the trotter\r\nMarmette brought to the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, aunty,\" said Sue, shrinking: \"it would be wrong while--\" While her\r\nlover was going to his death, Sue thought.\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw, child!\" said the dowager, writing. \"We'll see.--Ma'amselle, dress\r\nMiss Sue for a drive; and a touch of rouge, Hortense: she is too pale.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the yielding child, ignorant of her aunt's scheme, was being dressed\r\nlike a victim for sacrifice, Bob Nettles read the tinted note:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR MR. NETTLES: My niece, Susie Brown, tells me you\r\n     have an engagement to drive with her this afternoon.\r\n     Being unwilling to trust the dear child in a vehicle at\r\n     livery, permit an old lady to put one of her buggies\r\n     and fast trotters at your service.\"\r\n\r\nIf Bob Nettles had one dearer wish than another, it was to see his little\r\nplaymate once more, and make up that dispute before facing her cousin's\r\npistol. Aunt Fanny's plan of detaining him was likely to thrive.\r\n\r\nSudie came down, pale and tremulous as a little white withering\r\nrosebud--very pretty and timid and tender. There was a forced smile at\r\nmeeting, and but few words. He had intended to say how sorry he was to have\r\noffended her, but he did not. He saw or felt that there was nothing to\r\nforgive between them now. His was but a shallow, practical mind, and she\r\nwas only a timid, silly little girl; yet they knew of that unspoken love\r\nbetween them, and that there was a great trouble, without words.\r\n\r\nThe mare stooped to her work and shook herself into a trot, the spokes\r\nwhirling into feathery fans down the silvery-dusted pike cityward, and\r\nthen, skirting its southern flanks, on golden-cushioned country roads,\r\nrolling smoother and lighter, and the swift wheels growing more wing-like\r\nat top speed; under silver-leafed poplars and lombardies tapering like\r\nroad-side steeples; by thoroughfare and farm-gate; under beech and maple\r\ncopses and broad oaks on the park-like common; by scarp and counterscarp\r\nand over the smooth glacis of earthworks, memorials of the late war; by\r\nwoodlands of ash and beech, and over low fallow of redeemed marsh, right\r\ninto the golden eyelashes of the sun. The great summer city lay northward\r\nunder its nebulous canopy of dust, a soft hazy picture, dimpled with domes\r\nand spires. By surburban villas; by farmsteads overflowed by the swelling\r\ncity; by log churches in cool nooks, contradicting the pretentious\r\narchitecture about them; by happy evening lovers, and wives waiting at the\r\ngate for their home-coming husbands; by noisy German gardens, and revellers\r\nin quaint picturesque costumes; by rival coaches, and racing-buggies of the\r\nsporting gentry that tried to pass them, but soon gave out under the black\r\nmare's long, tireless stride; about the great city till the broad river lay\r\nall ablush before them with sunset. And then curving back into town, the\r\nsoft dazzle melting into umber; through streets breaking into brilliants of\r\nparallel burners that end in a star, to the utter confusion of geometric\r\ndefinition; through streets of home-going multitudes, and by open summer\r\nwindows showing the spread cloth and tableware; over the hoarse drum-beat\r\nof the bridge, and by the marble palaces of the dead looking cool and\r\ntranquil in the rising moon; winding the shell drive between Osage orange\r\nhedges; and then the half-aerial flight of those wing-like wheels is over\r\nfor ever and for ever.\r\n\r\nThen Sudie spoke. She felt she must say something, utter some protest of\r\nher womanhood against that wicked, wicked business: \"Mr. Nettles, do you\r\nnot think it wrong to fight a duel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss Sue,\" said he gravely, \"it is a very wicked thing.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked for some equivocation, some excuse or palliation of the wrong,\r\nwhich she would have to controvert--poor little logician of love!--and show\r\nhim how bad it was; and then he would not do it. She hardly knew what to\r\nsay to that speech.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I could love any one that fights duels,\" was the next\r\neffort, still, poor child! offering her coin, her woman's affections, in\r\nthat cruel, heedless market of men.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing: he felt it was right she should say that, and that he\r\nshould bear it in silence.\r\n\r\nAt the door he stopped to part with her for ever. She could not bear it.\r\nShe was deathly white, the touch of rouge starting out like a blood-spot.\r\n\r\n\"Cannot you help it?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, Miss Sue,\" he said simply, \"I can't.\"\r\n\r\nShe said nothing: just put up her lips and kissed him, and fled up stairs\r\nswiftly and softly, poor weeping, breaking little heart, crushed under the\r\niron wheels of that cruel code!\r\n\r\n\"Come in, Mr. Nettles,\" said the dowager: \"there is some one waiting here\r\nto see you.\"\r\n\r\nHe entered and found Mr. Winnett, a short, stout, dark-eyed gentleman, who\r\nshook hands with him laughingly as he said, \"We have heard of this\r\nbusiness, Mr. Nettles, and mean to stop it: it involves Mrs. Brown's name,\r\nyou see. But she will send you with the officer in her carriage to avoid\r\nany exposure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has Captain Mason been arrested?\" asked Bob.\r\n\r\n\"No, but--\"\r\n\r\nHe could say no more. Bob laid a hand on the broad sill of the open window,\r\nand crashed down among the running roses.\r\n\r\n\"Stop him!\" cried Mr. Winnett.\r\n\r\n\"Here, my little feller!\" said Policeman X----.\r\n\r\nBob was not short-stop for nothing. The man's heels went up as Bob leaped\r\ninto the buggy and drove off, the policeman following.\r\n\r\n\"The man's a fool,\" said Aunt Fanny.\r\n\r\n\"You mean Nettles?\"\r\n\r\n\"The man who tries to beat my trotter,\" said she. \"Well, we have played and\r\nlost.\"\r\n\r\nYes, lost; for that artful gamester, Mason, after his arrest had taken\r\nLevison aside and put it to that bold operator that his aunt's object was\r\nto break up the duel, and that she would pay any claim to do it, but if he\r\nwas detained by the writs of Levi and Walker the opportunity was lost. He\r\nagreed to give Levison a pre-dated note for two hundred and fifty dollars\r\nfor one hundred and twenty-five dollars cash if he (Levison) would release\r\nhim from the present arrest. We know the result. Instead of stopping her\r\nnephew, Aunt Fanny had lent him wings to fly. While the lawyer explained\r\nthis the bell rang and a card--Deane Lee, to see Captain Nettles--was\r\nbrought in.\r\n\r\n\"Who is Deane Lee?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"How fortunate!\" said the lawyer. \"It is Mr. Nettles's second.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can appeal to his feelings,\" said the dowager.\r\n\r\n\"Do,\" said he. \"I will remain outside, and use an appeal men of his sort\r\nunderstand better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray be seated, Captain Lee,\" said the dowager.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" thought Lee, \"is the lady who made the duel: she looks game to\r\ncarry it through;\" but he only bowed.\r\n\r\n\"I may be the first to inform you,\" said she, \"that my nephew will\r\nnecessarily require a postponement of his affair with your friend. We hope\r\nto have your help, sir.\"\r\n\r\nDeane fingered his cap and bowed again.\r\n\r\n\"To be entirely frank,\" said she graciously, \"Captain Mason lacks means. He\r\napplied to me, but of course I cannot furnish it for such a purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" said Lee: \"the matter has been too much talked of already;\r\nbut not by our side, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said she. \"You will, I trust, give us your assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly--yes'm,\" said Lee: \"it shall be done accordin' to Hoyle. Beg\r\npardon, but give yourself no trouble about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a burden you remove!\" said the dowager. \"Such a delicate matter, and\r\nmy nephew feels that his honor is involved. Oh, you men! you men! But I am\r\nso fortunate to have met you!\"\r\n\r\nThe dowager was really impressed and pleased with his prompt acquiescence\r\nin the postponement.\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm,\" continued Deane, \"I'll see to it at once. Nettles needn't know a\r\nword.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said the dowager, sunning him with a royal grace of\r\nmanner--\"so delicate and considerate in you! Yes, I should prefer that.\"\r\nShe evidently thought he referred to her nephew's impecuniosity; and he\r\ndid, but not as she supposed.\r\n\r\n\"Not a word,\" continued Deane, thinking she must be a right jolly old girl,\r\nafter all. \"Of course, ma'am, you couldn't advance the money to Captain\r\nMason: it 'ud look ugly for a lady. But the boys shall have their fun: I'll\r\nlend him the shads myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\" shrieked the dowager.\r\n\r\n\"I beg, ma'am, you'll take no trouble,\" said Deane, anxiously polite. \"It's\r\nno inconvenience whatever--in fact, to my advantage. I've got two or three\r\nlittle bets out the thing'll come off; so I'm bound to come out even.\"\r\n\r\nThe dowager flashed up, and rang the bell violently, her whole face\r\nconvulsed with passion: \"Show this man out! show him off the place!\"\r\n\r\nLee walked out gravely, fingering his cap. At the door he turned to the\r\nmulatto and said sympathetically, \"Does she have 'em often?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, young marsta?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fits,\" said Lee sententiously, and walked off.\r\n\r\nBut he was not through yet. The lawyer waited under the gaslight, and as\r\nthe soldier, pondering the late interview curiously, approached, he\r\naddressed him: \"Captain Lee, I believe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Them's my initials,\" said Deane. \"What about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A shrewd young fellow like you might make something out of this duel.\"\r\n\r\n\"As how?\" asked Deane.\r\n\r\n\"The old lady would pay handsomely to have it postponed,\" said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"Whe-ew-ew!\" whistled Lee, a light breaking on him. \"What a mule's head\r\nI've been!\"\r\n\r\n\"You see the chance, eh?\" asked the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"Lookee here,\" said Deane, taking him confidentially by the arm: \"I don't\r\nmind letting you into a secret if you'll keep dark.\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n\"_You_ can make a pot of money out of it,\" continued Deane.\r\n\r\nIt was not exactly the line of suggestion anticipated, and it was Mr.\r\nWinnett's turn to ask \"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've strictly private and confidential information, you know--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" acquiesced the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"That the other side is devilish hard up,\" said Deane in an emphatic\r\nwhisper. \"See 'em privately on that p'int. It's no use talking to us: we're\r\nflush.\"\r\n\r\nWith that he strode abruptly into the dark, leaving Mr. Winnett to puzzle\r\nout whether he had just heard a serious proposition or had been subjected\r\nto the hoax of a solemn wag.\r\n\r\nThat ended the efforts to stop the duel, and night with its grief and\r\npenitence came on all interested in the parties to it. On the dowager in\r\nher cushioned chair, with a finger in the prayer-book, seeing the portrait\r\nof her only son brought home stricken to death by his own gun thirty years\r\nago, as it changed from the long curls and blue eyes of childhood to a\r\nhandsome but weak bearded face of a man, dreadfully like that other face as\r\nshe saw it on the bed under the white seals of death. On a homely old\r\nmother lying in the back room of a village store, and a short, square man\r\nwalking up and down and saying, \"Don't take on so, old gal: you'll hurt\r\nyourself. It's just them newspaper lies. Our Bob wouldn't fight no dule.\"\r\nAnd the woman's sob: \"Lost, body and soul! soul and body!--our boy Bob,\r\nJohn! our boy Bob!\" On poor little Sue with her headache as she answers her\r\nmother's inquiry that she's \"Better, mamma;\" but as her father asks the\r\nsame question she puts up her arms about his neck, and says, \"Oh, papa! oh,\r\npapa!\" and the shrewd, worldly man kneels down and prays with her for the\r\nlife of that alien sinner yonder as he has not prayed since he was a man.\r\nOn Bob himself at the hotel quietly reading to the listening major, \"I am\r\nthe resurrection and the life: he that believeth in Me, though he were\r\ndead, yet shall he live,\" as if every comforting word was a denunciation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nAfter his victory over his aunt, Mason's spirits had been continually\r\nrising. That humorist Payne, who thought it such a hoax to pit two\r\ncocktails against each other and pull the strings of the puppets, writhed\r\nunder his merciless chaff. Mason had called for candles, and, chipping\r\nballs of the spermaceti blacked in an aesthetic spirit with pencil-dust, had\r\nused them for practice with a parlor pistol, alleging that the leaden balls\r\ndamaged the furniture. When Lee came to cast bullets, using the brazier's\r\nfurnace in the room, Mason made him sit down, took the moulds and threw\r\nthem in the Brown duelling pistol-case, and set himself to entertain the\r\nparty and chaff Payne. He lolled back in his chair, his handsome figure\r\nshowing to advantage, now rallying Payne on the prospect of figuring in a\r\n\"ring-tailed gaberdine\" as a victim of the dowager's anger, and now\r\nreciting marvellous horse-stories, mixed with anecdotes pertinent and\r\nimpertinent. The party consisted of an editor, a surgeon, a German\r\ngeologist prospecting that wonderful fossil bed of the Falls, and evidently\r\nlooking on Mason as a miracle excelling anything dug up, and the seconds.\r\n\r\nMason rattled on with his racing and racy anecdotes: \"Yes, sir, it was a\r\nperfectly white mare, sky-blue mane and tail. I put her in the racing-buggy\r\non Aunt Fanny's round quarter-track, and she spun around so fast the off\r\nwheels never touched the turf from the quarter-post to the judges' stand.\r\nFact, gentlemen! fastest trotting-time on record. Rather peculiar color\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" said the German in admiration of his host. \"A remarkable\r\npeculiarity in the pigment granules. What became of this singular animal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Singular, as you say,\" said Mason easily. \"She took navicular and jolted\r\noff her pins: trotted ten miles an hour on the stubs after she cast her\r\nhoofs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eggsdraordinary vitality!\" ejaculated the German in deep gutturals, and\r\nlooking around as if distrustful of Mason's rapid utterance. \"How did you\r\ncall it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Skylight,\" said Mason carelessly. \"Imp. Milky Way by dam Cerulean, as the\r\nstud-books rather profanely style it. Tremendous vitality, though!\" passing\r\na pair of moulds to Lee and winking to attract his attention, \"I thought to\r\npreserve the hair and hide as a curiosity. Wouldn't do--wouldn't begin to\r\ndo! Digestive function so strong action continued from the skin. Had to\r\nsubstitute brickdust and charcoal. Drop into my private museum some day.\r\nHappy to show you that and some other curiosities picked up in my rather\r\nremarkable adventures.\"\r\n\r\nLee was now busy casting bullets, and Mason's spirits seemed to rise with\r\nthe operation. Some listened, others laughed, but Mason had a cool way of\r\nperking up his eyebrows and going on negligently, as much as to say, \"If\r\nyou deprive yourself of the satisfaction of believing, the fault lies with\r\nthe listener.\" He seemed divided between a wish to distract Lee from\r\ncareful observation of his employment and to chaff Payne. Once Payne\r\nstarted suddenly as if about to say something to Lee, but a look quenched\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Friend of my youth, this goblet sip,\" laughed Mason. \"For what says the\r\nPsalmist?--'Let the galded jade wince, our wethers is unwrung.' But never\r\nbe it said,\" rising and speaking with theatrical emotion--\"Not while Reason\r\nholds her throne in this distracted globe--never, while Mason lives, shall\r\nhis Damon, his caster, be cast in prison-bonds by a ravaging female\r\nshe-aunt. Never shall penitential garb encase those manly limbs nor base\r\nturnkey's shears clip those auburn locks for which ripe beauty in melting\r\naccents is wont to plead in vain.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're devilish generous,\" growled Payne. \"You know the old griffin\r\ndoesn't propose to bag me unless you get hit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible,\" asked the German, catching a meaning in this raillery,\r\n\"the second of an American duel is imprisoned if his principal is shot? I\r\nask for information.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have come to the right shop now,\" said Lind. \"He is, invariably. Some\r\nrather curious contretemps grow out of it. Duelling is very popular among\r\nus, very--especially with the fair sex,\" kissing his hand to an indefinite\r\nnoun of multitude. \"A great favorite being imprisoned for acting as second,\r\nthe people took it up--elected him governor by an overwhelming majority. It\r\nwas supposed, of course, he would pardon himself; but no: he was a Roman,\r\nthe noblest Roman of them all. 'The prerogative of executive clemency,' he\r\nsaid, 'had already been grossly abused. It would ill repay the generous\r\nconfidence of his constituents to exercise it in his own behalf and in\r\norder to escape the just penalty of the law.' He refused to pardon himself,\r\nand so served out his term in both offices.\"\r\n\r\nThis struck the German as something heroic.\r\n\r\n\"True, sir, true,\" said Lind: \"rather inconvenient, however. When the\r\nlegislature met, as it necessarily did, in the penitentiary, you could not\r\ntell a member from a convict. Rather awkward, you see, if the wrong body\r\nadjourned itself by mistake.\"\r\n\r\nThe party broke up late, and Mason, throwing off his coat, called for\r\nWebster's _Quarto_ and Watson's _Poetical Quotations_, saying he would\r\naddress his aunt in such an Orphic strain as would make her wig curl and\r\nma'amselle's rouge-pot chalky. Watson's _Poetical Quotations_ was not in\r\nthe hotel; but with the big _Quarto_ before him, arms akimbo, his legs\r\nspread out under the table, Mason went at his task, pausing to shout a\r\npassage at Payne, and swear it would liquefy the crystal of his aunt's\r\nfrigid humor like a hot collar in July, or to scratch his head over some\r\nfickle-vowelled monosyllable that defied orthography; and the soft dark\r\nnight deepened to the gray, lustreless morning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn early marketer from Jeffersonville spread a rumor that R. Nettles was\r\nshot through the lungs, and poor little Sue read it in the paper an hour\r\nlater. An eager reporter recognized the hotel-van from over the river, with\r\na tarpaulin thrown over its contents. \"Anything of Captain Mason's party?\"\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n\"Stout, rosy man, good deal o' gas?\" asked the porter.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! yes! what of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing: I guess he won't gas no more,\" motioning toward the tarpaulin.\r\n\"Them's his'n. Do you know where his aunt lives?\"\r\n\r\nAnybody knows; the van drives off; the rumor flies--both parties slain.\r\n\r\nLet us follow the van. At Aunt Fanny's the tarpaulin is thrown off, and\r\nreveals nothing worse than a trunk, gun-case, etc., but the man's story\r\nconfirms the worst. He has a letter for the dowager, and it is sent up. The\r\ndowager calls ma'amselle to read, which she does with strong emotion and\r\nFrench accent:\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR AND VENERATED AUNT--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hand me the vinaigrette, and don't read so loud: I am not deaf,\" said the\r\ndowager.\r\n\r\nThe poor maid subdued her tones as she best could, and read:\r\n\r\n\"Now is the hour when churchyards yawn and graves give up their dead. It is\r\nmidnight's holy hour. I hear the rush of the Falls like a mill-sluice, and\r\nit recalls 'the happy, happy hours of childhood.' But ere another day I may\r\nride upon the Styx, and hear the dam loud roaring no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ride upon a stick, and hear _what_?\" ejaculated the dowager at poor Lind's\r\nrhetoric.\r\n\r\n\"Mais oui, madame,\" translates the French maid, \"c'est la fleuve de l'enfer\r\net les cris des ames perdues.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the Styx!\" said the dowager, taking snuff.--\"Use your handkerchief,\r\nHortense, and go on.\"\r\n\r\nShe obeys:\r\n\r\n\"Ere my venerated aunt peruses this calligraphy an eagle soaring in its\r\npride of place will be by a mousing Nettles hawked at and killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor boy!\" said his aunt. \"I must have a black grenadine, trimmed with\r\nbugles and flounced very deep, for mourning.--Don't forget it, Hortense.\"\r\n\r\n\"My last thoughts,\" continued the reader, \"are with my revered relative;\r\nfor who forgave the boyish trick, and fed me on a candy-stick, and nursed\r\nme when it made me sick?--My aunt. Who taught me to back a colt or make a\r\nbook? Who entered me for the purse with Cousin Fanny Alison, but the filly\r\nbolted with Bob Ascot?--My aunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Patience alive!\" cried the dowager: \"what does the man mean, with his\r\ndoggerel poetry and slang of the stables at such a time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, madame! it is noble,\" said the poor maid with streaming eyes, and then\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"She besought me with the salt rheum in her optical organs to suppress my\r\nfury; but who can restrain the wrath of a Brown? She denied me the\r\nspondulics--a Latin word for cash--to carry out my nefarious purpose,\r\nthough it grieved her generous heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's well thought of,\" said the dowager. \"People talk so. We must get it\r\nto those newspaper-men. Poor Lind!\"\r\n\r\n\"To those who assert a mercenary motive I triumphantly respond, 'She paid\r\nup my little bills, and has doubtless destroyed the evidences of them.'\"\r\n\r\n\"They are in the steel casket,\" said the dowager. \"Burn them. But he never\r\nwould have paid.\"\r\n\r\n\"When she honors my sight draft,\" read ma'amselle, \"for two-fifty to settle\r\nup my present expenses in this business, she will pay the last debt of him\r\nwho has paid the last debt of Nature. For if the knave do cut but deep\r\nenough, I'll pay it instantly with all my heart. (_Shakespeare_.)\r\n\r\nL. BROWN MASON.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me the cheque-book, and let the man come up,\" said the dowager.\r\n\r\nThe man was questioned, and had but little to tell. He was told Captain\r\nMason had been shot, and to bring the letter. After he was dismissed the\r\ndowager said, \"Let Fanny bring the chocolate. I hope the cream is better:\r\nit curdled yesterday. Poor Lind! He had a good heart.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout the time his aunt was cashing his last draft, and reckoning that that\r\nlittle enterprise of marrying Sue Brown to Captain Mason had cost her a\r\nthousand dollars for failure, Captain Mason, with a party in the carriage,\r\nstood on Mrs. Walter Brown's front steps explaining to her that at a little\r\nexpense in cutting down her ornamental trees and grubbing up her rare\r\nexotic shrubbery the front lawn could be converted into a beautiful\r\nquarter-track, and offering his services to effect the desirable change.\r\nThen advancing, he graciously held out his hand to poor, pale, red-eyed\r\nlittle Sudie, still hysterical over that dreadful paragraph.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Sue tartly. \"Mamma may shelter you from the police, but you\r\nought to be hung. There! And I won't shake a _murderer's_ hand. There! I\r\nwon't! I won't! I won't! There!\"\r\n\r\nMason's jolly face looked queer. \"I see,\" said he. \"'Twas ever thus from\r\nchildhood's hour. I never bucked a card or colt, but what some fellow held\r\nthe bower or else that horse was sure to bolt. When, at pensive evening's\r\nhour, I stroll among the tombs, I read the virtues of the--erra--clammy,\r\nthe clammy. As I read the testimony of the rocks, of the rocks, it strikes\r\nme the wicked never die, and I long to be--erra--wicked. There is no\r\nraising that card,\" wagging his head solemnly at little Sue, who stared in\r\nspite of herself, \"until Gable--I believe his name is Gable--turns trump.\r\nBut I have brought you all that is mortal of the late R. Nettles.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to the door as he spoke, while the shocked, terrified girl hid\r\nher face, thinking of the vision in that very parlor under the white seals\r\nof death.\r\n\r\nBut Bob Nettles's cheery, commonplace tones interrupted: \"How'd do, Miss\r\nSue? how'd do, Mrs. Brown? Captain Mason said he'd break it to you, and I\r\nthought--\"\r\n\r\nBut Sue had turned her face to the wall in a corner, and stood shaking her\r\nplump shoulders and stamping her little feet like a pettish child, as she\r\nsaid, \"Go 'way from me, Bob Nettles! I'll never speak to you again as long\r\nas I live; and as for Cousin Lind,\" with a shake and a stamp, \"I hate him!\"\r\n\r\n\"See what it is to lose the virtues of the clammy,\" said Mason, pulling his\r\nbeard and grinning at Bob's blank looks. \"But I must go to my aunt. By a\r\nshocking oversight we forgot to settle the hotel-bill at Jeffersonville,\r\nand I am afraid the greedy landlord has forwarded a note to have been\r\ndelivered to her in case of accident, and a draft. It is humiliating to\r\nthink she has paid it, and honor requires I should promptly settle it with\r\nan I.O.U. As for Payne--\"\r\n\r\n\"Dry that up,\" said Payne.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll only say the next duel I fight may Payne load the pistols!\"\r\nadded the captain.\r\n\r\nWhat that meant is the unsolved mystery of the duel. Deane Lee insists that\r\nit was a fair, honest, stand-up fight. True, he had used the wrong moulds\r\nthe night before in casting bullets, but he had seen Payne load the famous\r\nBrown duelling-pistols.\r\n\r\nBut Mason's old comrades wink at the story of the wax bullets blacked with\r\npencil-dust by Mason to represent the real thing, and say Payne was so\r\ncowed by the dowager's threat and Mason's chaff that no power could have\r\nmade him charge with dangerous missiles. Mason himself says that neither he\r\nnor Nettles could have hit a barn-door; but a mere index of the veracious\r\nstories of that famous duel, as told by Mason, would fill a book. As his\r\ndebts were paid and the dowager keeps him in feather, and as Bob and Sue\r\nwere married, that game-bird is right in declaring it the only duel that\r\nwas ever \"satisfactorily adjusted honorably to all parties.\"\r\n\r\nWILL WALLACE HARNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLK-LORE OF THE SOUTHERN NEGROES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll tribes and peoples have their folk-lore, whether embodied in tales of\r\ndaring adventure, as in our own doughty Jack the Giant-killer, or in\r\nstories of genii and magic, as in the _Arabian Nights_, or in legends of\r\nwraiths, witches, bogles and apparitions, as among the Scotch peasantry;\r\nand these fables are so strongly tinged with the peculiarities--or rather\r\nthe idiosyncrasies--of the race among whom they originate as to furnish a\r\nfair index of its mental and moral characteristics, not only at the time of\r\ntheir origin, but so long as the people continue to narrate them or listen\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThe folk-lore of Africo-Americans, as appearing in our Southern States, is\r\na medley of fables, songs, sayings, incantations, charms and superstitious\r\ntraditions brought from various tribes along the West African coast, and so\r\nfar condensed into one mass in their American homes that often part of a\r\nstory or tradition belonging to one tribe is grafted, without much regard\r\nto consistency, upon a part belonging to another people, while they are\r\nstill further complicated by the frequent infusion into them of ideas\r\nevidently derived from communication with the white race.\r\n\r\nAny one who will take the trouble to analyze the predominant traits of\r\nnegro character, and to collate them with the predominant traits of African\r\nfolk-lore, will discern the fitness of each to each. On every side he will\r\ndiscover evidences of a passion for music and dancing, for visiting and\r\nchatting, for fishing and snaring, indeed for any pleasure requiring little\r\nexertion of either mind or body; evidences also of a gentle, pliable and\r\neasy temper--of a quick and sincere sympathy with suffering wheresoever\r\nseen--of a very low standard of morals, combined with remarkable dexterity\r\nin satisfying themselves that it is right to do as they wish. Another\r\ntrait, strong enough and universal enough to atone for many a dark one, is\r\nthat, as a rule, there is nothing of the fierce and cruel in their nature,\r\nand it is scarcely possible for anything of this kind to be grafted\r\npermanently upon them.\r\n\r\nOf their American-born superstitions, by far the greater part are\r\ninterwoven with so-called religious beliefs, and go far to show their\r\nnative faith in dreams and visions, which they are not slow to narrate, to\r\nembellish, and even to fabricate extemporaneously, to suit the ears of a\r\ncredulous listener; also showing their natural tendency to rely upon\r\noutward observances, as if possessed of some _fetish_-like virtue, and in\r\ncertain cases a horrible debasement of some of the highest and noblest\r\ndoctrines of the Christian faith. These superstitions must of course be\r\nconsidered apart from the real character of those who are sincerely pious,\r\nand upon which they are so many blemishes. They are, in fact, the rank and\r\nmorbid outgrowth of the peculiarities of religious denominations grafted\r\nupon the prolific soil of their native character.\r\n\r\nOf the few which may be mentioned without fear of offence, since they\r\nbelong to the negro rather than to his denomination, the following are\r\nexamples: Tools to be used in digging a grave must never be carried through\r\na house which any one inhabits, else they will soon be used for digging the\r\ngrave of the dweller. Tools already used for such a purpose must not be\r\ncarried directly home. This would bring the family too closely for safety\r\ninto contact with the dead. They must be laid reverently beside the grave,\r\nand allowed to remain there all night. A superstition in respect to posture\r\nis by some very rigorously observed. It is, that religious people must\r\nnever sit with their legs crossed. The only reason given--though we cannot\r\nhelp suspecting that there must be another kept in concealment--is, that\r\n_crossing the legs is the same as dancing, and dancing is a sin_.\r\n\r\nThese are fair samples of Americanized superstitions--puerile, it is true,\r\nbut harmless. It is only when we come into contact with negroes of pure\r\nAfrican descent that we discover evidences of a once prevalent and not\r\nwholly discarded demonolatry. The native religion of the West African,\r\nexcept where elevated by the influence of Mohammedanism, was not--and,\r\ntravellers tell us, is not yet--a worship of God as such, nor even an\r\nattempt to know and honor Him, but a constant effort at self-protection.\r\nThe true God, they say, calls for no worship; for, being good in and of\r\nhimself, He will do all the good He can without being asked. But there are\r\nmultitudes of malignant spirits whose delight is to mislead and to destroy.\r\nThese must be propitiated by gifts and acts of worship, or rendered\r\npowerless by charms and incantations.\r\n\r\nNo one knows, or has the means of ascertaining, to what extent real\r\ndevil-worship is practised in America, because it is always conducted in\r\nsecret; but we have reason to believe that it has almost entirely ceased,\r\nbeing shamed out of existence by the loveliness of a purer and better\r\nfaith, and a belief in the agency of evil spirits, and consequent dread of\r\ntheir malign powers, although still more or less dominant with the negroes,\r\nhas also greatly declined.[C] To give a sample of this last: The time\r\nwas--but it has nearly passed away, or else the writer has not been for\r\nmany years in the way of hearing of it, as in the days of childhood--when\r\none of the objects of greatest dread among our seaboard negroes was the\r\n\"Jack-muh-lantern.\" This terrible creature--who on dark, damp nights would\r\nwander with his lantern through woods and marshes, seeking to mislead\r\npeople to their destruction--was described by a negro who seemed perfectly\r\nfamiliar with his subject as a hideous little being, somewhat human in\r\nform, though covered with hair like a dog. It had great goggle eyes, and\r\nthick, sausage-like lips that opened from ear to ear. In height it seldom\r\nexceeded four or five feet, and it was quite slender in form, but such was\r\nits power of locomotion that no one on the swiftest horse could overtake it\r\nor escape from it, for it could leap like a grasshopper to almost any\r\ndistance, and its strength was beyond all human resistance. No one ever\r\nheard of its victims being bitten or torn: they were only compelled to go\r\nwith it into bogs and swamps and marshes, and there left to sink and die.\r\nThere was only one mode of escape for those who were so unfortunate as to\r\nbe met by one of these mischievous night-walkers, and that was by a charm;\r\nbut that charm was easy and within everybody's reach. Whether met by marsh\r\nor roadside, the person had only to take off his coat or outer garment and\r\nput it on again inside out, and the foul fiend was instantly deprived of\r\nall power to harm.\r\n\r\nMultifarious, however, as are the forms and aspects of folk-lore among this\r\nremarkable and in some respects highly interesting people, the chief bulk\r\nof it lies stored away among their fables, which are as purely African as\r\nare their faces or their own plaintive melodies. Travellers and\r\nmissionaries tell us that the same sweet airs which are so often heard in\r\nreligious meetings in America, set to Christian hymns, are to be recognized\r\nin the boats and palm-roofed houses of Africa, set to heathen words, and\r\nthat the same wild stories of Buh Rabbit, Buh Wolf, and other _Buhs_ that\r\nare so charming to the ears of American children, are to be heard to this\r\nday in Africa, differing only in the drapery necessary to the change of\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nAlmost without exception the actors in these fables are brute animals\r\nendowed with speech and reason, in whom mingle strangely, and with\r\nludicrous incongruity, the human and brute characteristics. The _dramatis\r\npersonae_ are always honored with the title of _Buh_, which is generally\r\nsupposed to be an abbreviation of the word \"brother\" (the _br_ being\r\nsounded without the whir of the _r_), but it probably is a title of respect\r\nequivalent to our Mr. The animals which figure in the stories are chiefly\r\nBuh Rabbit, Buh Lion, Buh Wolf and Buh Deer, though sometimes we hear of\r\nBuh Elephant, Buh Fox, Buh Cooter and Buh Goose. As a rule, each Buh\r\nsustains in every fable the same general character. Buh Deer is always a\r\nsimpleton; Buh Wolf always rapacious and tricky; Buh Rabbit foppish, vain,\r\nquick-witted, though at times a great fool; Buh Elephant quiet, sensible\r\nand dignified.\r\n\r\nOf the Buh fables, that which is by all odds the greatest favorite, and\r\nwhich appears in the greatest variety of forms, is the \"Story of Buh Rabbit\r\nand the Tar Baby.\" Each variation preserves the great landmarks,\r\nparticularly the closing scene. According to the most thoroughly African\r\nversion, it runs thus: Buh Rabbit and Buh Wolf are neighbors. In a\r\nconversation one day Buh Wolf proposes that they two shall dig a well for\r\ntheir joint benefit, instead of depending upon chance rainfalls or going to\r\ndistant pools or branches, as they often have to do, to quench their\r\nthirst. To this Buh Rabbit, who has no fondness for labor, though willing\r\nenough to enjoy its fruits, offers various objections, and finally gives a\r\nflat refusal.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" says Buh Wolf, who perfectly understands his neighbor, \"if you no\r\nhelp to dig well, you mustn't use de water.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for I gwine use de water?\" responds Buh Rabbit with affected disdain.\r\n\"What use I got for well? In de mornin' I drink de dew, an' in middle o'\r\nday I drink from de cow-tracks.\"\r\n\r\nThe well is dug by Buh Wolf alone, who after a while perceives that some\r\none besides himself draws from it. He watches, and soon identifies the\r\nintruder as Buh Rabbit, who makes his visits by night. \"Ebery mornin' he\r\nsee Buh Rabbit tracks--ebery mornin' Buh Rabbit tracks.\" Indignant at the\r\nintrusion, he resolves to set a trap for his thievish neighbor and to put\r\nhim to death. Knowing Buh Rabbit's buckish love for the ladies, he fits up\r\na _tar baby_, made to look like a beautiful girl, and sets it near the\r\nwell. By what magical process this manufacture of an attractive-looking\r\nyoung lady out of treacherous adhesive tar is accomplished we are not\r\ninformed. But listeners to stories must not be inquisitive about the\r\nmysterious parts: they must be content to hear.\r\n\r\nBuh Rabbit, emboldened by long impunity, goes to the well as usual after\r\ndark, sees this beautiful creature standing there motionless, peeps at it\r\ntime and again suspiciously; but being satisfied that it is really a young\r\nlady, he makes a polite bow and addresses her in gallant language. The\r\nyoung lady makes no reply. This encourages him to ask if he may not come to\r\ntake a kiss. Still no reply. He sets his water-bucket on the ground,\r\nmarches up boldly and obtains the kiss, but finds to his surprise that he\r\ncannot get away: his lips are held fast by the tar. He struggles and tries\r\nto persuade her to let him go. How he is able to speak with his lips\r\nsticking fast is another unexplained mystery; but no matter: he does speak,\r\nand most eloquently, yet in vain. He now changes his tone, and threatens\r\nher with a slap. Still no answer. He administers the slap, and his hand\r\nsticks fast. One after the other, both hands and both feet, as well as his\r\nmouth, are thus caught, and poor Buh Rabbit remains a prisoner until Buh\r\nWolf comes the next morning to draw water.\r\n\r\n\"Eh! eh! Buh Rabbit, wah de matter?\" exclaims Buh Wolf, affecting the\r\ngreatest surprise at his neighbor's woeful plight.\r\n\r\nBuh Rabbit, who has as little regard for truth as for honesty, replies,\r\nattempting to throw all the blame upon the deceitful maiden by whom he has\r\nbeen entrapped, not even suspecting yet--so we are to infer--that she is\r\nmade of tar instead of living flesh. He declares with all the earnestness\r\nof injured innocence that he was passing by, in the sweet, honest\r\nmoonlight, in pursuit of his lawful business, when this girl _hailed_ him,\r\nand decoyed him into giving her a kiss, and was now holding him in unlawful\r\ndurance.\r\n\r\nThe listener ironically commiserates his captive neighbor, and proposes to\r\nset him free; when, suddenly noticing the water-bucket and the tracks by\r\nthe well, he charges Buh Rabbit with his repeated robberies by night, and\r\nconcludes by declaring his intention to put him to immediate death.\r\n\r\nThe case has now become pretty serious, and Buh Rabbit is of course\r\nwoefully troubled at the near approach of the great catastrophe: still,\r\neven in this dire extremity, his wits do not cease to cheer him with some\r\nhope of escape. Seeing that his captor is preparing to hang him--for the\r\ncord is already around his neck and he is being dragged toward an\r\noverhanging limb--he expresses the greatest joy by capering, dancing and\r\nclapping his hands--so much so that the other curiously inquires, \"What for\r\nyou so glad, Buh Rabbit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" replies the sly hypocrite, \"because you gwine hang me and not trow me\r\nin de brier-bush.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for I mustn't trow you in de brier-bush?\" inquires Mr. Simpleton\r\nWolf.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" prays Buh Rabbit with a doleful whimper, \"please hang me: please trow\r\nme in de water or trow me in de fire, where I die at once. But don't--oh\r\ndon't--trow me in de brier-bush to tear my poor flesh from off my bones.\"\r\n\r\n\"I gwine to do 'zactly wah you ax me not to do,\" returns Wolf in savage\r\ntone. Then, going to a neighboring patch of thick, strong briers, he\r\npitches Buh Rabbit headlong in the midst, and says, \"Now let's see de flesh\r\ncome off de bones.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner, however, does the struggling and protesting Buh Rabbit find\r\nhimself among the briers than he slides gently to the ground, and peeping\r\nat his would-be torturer from a safe place behind the stems, he says,\r\n\"Tankee, Buh Wolf--a tousand tankee--for _bring me home_! De brier-bush _de\r\nberry place where I been born_.\"\r\n\r\nAnother favorite story is that of the \"Foot-Race.\" Buh Rabbit and Buh Frog\r\nare admirers of the beautiful Miss Dinah, and try their best to win her.\r\nThe lady likes them both, but not being permitted to marry both, she\r\nresolves to make her choice depend upon the result of a foot-race. The\r\ndistance is to be ten miles--that is, five miles out and five miles\r\nin--along a level road densely bordered with bushes. The day arrives. Miss\r\nDinah, seated at the starting-point, is to give the word to the rivals, who\r\nstand one on either side, and the goal for the winner is to be a place _in\r\nher lap_. By agreement, Buh Rabbit is to take the open road, and Buh Frog,\r\nwho prefers it, is allowed to leap through the bushes, and both are to\r\nhalloo to each other at the end of every mile. Buh Rabbit, however, with\r\nall his cunning, has this time met his match; for Buh Frog has engaged five\r\nof his kinsmen, so nearly like himself in appearance that they cannot be\r\ndistinguished from him, and has stationed one in concealment near each\r\nmile-post, with instructions how to act, while he has provided for himself\r\na nice hiding-place in the bushes near Miss Dinah's seat. At the word Go!\r\nthe rivals start, Buh Frog leaping into the bushes, where he disappears,\r\nand Buh Rabbit capering along the road and flaunting his white tail merrily\r\nat the thought of distancing the other so far that he shall never see or\r\nhear of him again till after Miss Dinah has been won. At the end of the\r\nfirst mile Buh Rabbit turns his head back and tauntingly halloos, \"I here,\r\nBuh Frog! How you git 'long?\"\r\n\r\nTo his dismay, however, he hears the voice of the other in the bushes ahead\r\nof him singing out, \"Boo-noo! I here too! I beat you here, I'll beat you\r\nthere: I'll beat you back to Miss Dinah's lap!\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this boast repeated ahead of him in the bushes at each\r\nmile-post, Buh Rabbit becomes frantic, and rushes through the last mile as\r\nhe had never run before. But all in vain. Just as he comes within easy view\r\nof the coveted goal he sees Buh Frog leap from the bushes plump into Miss\r\nDinah's lap, and hears him sing, with as good breath as though he had not\r\nrun a mile,\r\n\r\n    \"Boo-noo! Before you!\r\n    I beat you there, I beat you here:\r\n    I've beat you back to Miss Dinah's lap!\"\r\n\r\nAnother version makes the competitors Buh Deer and Buh Cooter (the negro\r\nname for terrapin or land-tortoise), in which Buh Cooter wins the day by\r\ncollusion with some of his closely-resembling kin. Substantially the same\r\nstory is to be heard from the natives of each of the four continents, but\r\nwhether the African gained his idea of it from Europe or Asia, or whether\r\nthe European or Asian gained it from Africa, is perhaps past determining.\r\nThe writer can testify that the story as above narrated, or rather the\r\nsubstance of it, was told him in childhood by negroes supposed to have\r\nobtained it direct from Africa.\r\n\r\nSome of these stories are mere laudations of Buh Rabbit's shrewdness and\r\ncommon sense. Buh Wolf has long had a watering of the mouth for\r\nrabbit-flesh, but has never been able to gratify it. He finally hits upon\r\nthe following expedient: He causes a report to be spread that he has\r\nsuddenly died, and all his neighbors, especially Buh Rabbit, are invited to\r\nhis funeral. He has no doubt that his plump, short-tailed neighbor, being\r\nonce enclosed within the walls of his house, will fall an easy prey to\r\nhimself and his attending cousins. Buh Rabbit, however, is not to be easily\r\nensnared. He goes demurely to the house of mourning, but does not enter. He\r\nseats himself on the steps by the side of Buh Cat, who is enjoying the\r\nsunshine in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Is Buh Wolf dead, for true and true?\" he inquires.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so. Eberybody say he dead,\" answers Buh Cat.\r\n\r\n\"How did he die, and when?\" he continues to inquire.\r\n\r\nBuh Cat gives the particulars as reported to him, and Buh Rabbit pretends\r\nto receive them with all faith, expressing great sorrow for the loss\r\nexperienced by the neighborhood. But after a little musing he seems to be\r\nstruck with a new idea, and turning to Buh Cat he inquires in hopeful tone,\r\n\"But did he _grin_ or _whistle_ before he died? People who die _must_ do\r\none or t'other; and some, who die hard, do both. I'm a doctor, you know.\"\r\n\r\nThis is said in the doorway, near the stiff-looking corpse, and in a\r\nwhisper loud enough to be heard all through the room. Very soon Buh Wolf is\r\nheard to whistle, and then his lips settle into a grin so broad as to show\r\nhis teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Buh Cat,\" says Buh Rabbit, putting his hand on his stomach and screwing up\r\nhis face as if seized with mortal sickness, \"I mus' hurry home and take\r\nsome yarb tea, or mebbe I'll have to grin and whistle like our poor\r\nneighbor. Good-bye, Buh Cat. Come to me, please, after Buh Wolf done berry\r\nand tell me all about it. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of all who are not in the secret, the corpse gives a loud\r\nsneeze, then leaps from the table, throws off his \"berryin' clothes,\" and\r\njoins his friends in eating heartily of his own funeral dinner.\r\n\r\nHis hankering, however, for rabbit-mutton still continues, and he resolves,\r\nnotwithstanding his recent inglorious defeat, to attempt again to gratify\r\nit. With this end in view he makes frequent visits to his neighbor and\r\ntalks with him across the fence, but is never invited beyond. One day, in\r\nthe course of conversation, he informs him that there is a fine pear tree\r\non the other side of a neighboring field, loaded with luscious fruit just\r\nin condition to be gathered.\r\n\r\n\"I will go get some.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, when the sun is about halfway up the sky.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go: I will join you there.\"\r\n\r\nBuh Rabbit rises very early, goes to the tree soon after daybreak, finds\r\nthe pears uncommonly good, and is laughing to himself to think how he has\r\noutwitted his enemy, when he hears a voice under the tree: \"Ho, Mr. Rabbit!\r\nin the tree a'ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replies Buh Rabbit, trembling at the sight of his dreaded foe: \"I\r\nwait for you, and tink you nebber gwine come. I tell you w'at,\" smacking\r\nhis lips, \"dem here pear too good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you trow me down some?\" inquires Buh Wolf, so strongly impressed by\r\nthe sound of that eloquent smack that he longs to get a taste of the fruit.\r\n\r\nBuh Rabbit selects some of the finest, which he throws far off in the soft\r\ngrass, in order, he says, to avoid bruising, and while Buh Wolf is engaged\r\nin eating them, with his head buried in the grass, Buh Rabbit slides\r\nquietly from the tree and hurries home.\r\n\r\nA few days thereafter Buh Wolf makes still another attempt. He pays a visit\r\nas before, and speaks of a great fair to be held next day in a neighboring\r\ntown. \"I am going,\" says the rash Buh Rabbit; and he does go, although we\r\nmight suppose that he would have sense enough to keep out of harm's way. On\r\nreturning home, late in the day, he sees Buh Wolf sitting on a log by the\r\nroadside, at the bottom of a hill, waiting for him. His preparations for\r\nescape have already been made in the purchase of a quantity of hollow\r\ntinware. Slipping quietly into the bushes, without being seen by the\r\nwaylayer, he puts a big tin mug on his head and a tin cup on each hand and\r\nfoot, and, hanging various tin articles around his body, he comes rolling\r\ndown the hill toward Buh Wolf, who is so frightened at the unearthly noise\r\nthat he runs off with his tail between his legs, and never troubles Buh\r\nRabbit again.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between them, however, does not cease even with this triumph\r\nof the weaker party. There is a contest now of love and strategem. They\r\nboth pay their addresses to the same young lady, making their visits to her\r\non alternate evenings. In the progress of the courtship Buh Rabbit learns\r\nthat his rival has spoken of him contemptuously, saying that he is very\r\ndressy and foppish, it is true, but that he has no manliness; adding that\r\nhe (Buh Wolf) could eat him up at a mouthful. To this Buh Rabbit retorts\r\nthe next evening by assuring Miss Dinah that Buh Wolf was nothing but his\r\ngrandfather's old _riding horse_; adding, \"I ride him, and whip him too,\r\nwhenever I choose, and he obeys me like a dog.\" The next afternoon Buh\r\nRabbit tempts his unsuspecting rival to join him in the play of riding\r\nhorse, which consists in each in turn mounting the other's back and riding\r\nfor a while. Buh Rabbit, who has thought out the whole case beforehand,\r\noffers to give the first ride, and so times it that the ride ends at his\r\nown door about the time for the usual visit to Miss Dinah. He runs into the\r\nhouse and puts on his dandy clothes, pleading that he cannot enjoy a ride\r\nunless he is in full dress; and pleading, moreover, that he cannot ride\r\nwithout saddle and bridle and all that belongs to a horseman, he persuades\r\nMr. Fool Wolf to allow a strong, rough bit to be put into his mouth and a\r\nclose-fitting saddle to be girded to his back, upon which Buh Rabbit\r\nmounts, holding in his hand a terrible whip and having his heels armed with\r\na pair of long sharp spurs. Thus accoutred, he prevails upon Buh Wolf to\r\ntake the road toward Miss Dinah's house, on approaching which he so\r\nvigorously applies both whip and spur as to compel his resisting steed to\r\ntrot up to the door, where Buh Rabbit bows politely to his lady-love,\r\nsaying, \"I told you so: now you see for yourself.\" Of course he wins the\r\nbride.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of stories approaching somewhat in character those related\r\nof our own Jack the Giant-killer, leaving out the giants. The one given\r\nbelow seems to have a common origin with the Anglo-Saxon story of the\r\n\"Three Blue Pigs.\" This is entitled \"Tiny Pig.\"\r\n\r\nA family of seven pigs leave home to seek their fortunes, and settle in a\r\nneighborhood harassed by a mischievous fox. Each of these pigs builds\r\nhimself a house of dirt, except Tiny Pig, who, though the runt of the\r\nlitter, is a sensible little fellow and the hero of the tale. He builds his\r\nhouse of stone, with good strong doors and a substantial chimney. In due\r\ncourse of time, Fox, being hungry, comes to the house of one of the\r\nbrothers, and asks to be admitted, but is refused. The request and refusal,\r\nas told by the negroes, is couched in language which is intended to be\r\npoetical, and is certainly not without some pretension to the picturesque.\r\nFox's request in each case is--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig, oh let me in:\r\n    I'll go away soon, and not touch a thing.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the refusal is--\r\n\r\n    \"No, no, Mr. Fox, by the beard on my chin!\r\n    You may say what you will, but I'll not let you in.\"\r\n\r\nOn being refused, Fox threatens to _blow down_ the house and eat up the\r\noccupant. Pig continuing to refuse--as what pig would not?--the house is\r\nblown down and the owner eaten up. This sad fate befalls in turn each of\r\nthe six who had been so foolish or so lazy as to build their houses of\r\ndirt. Fox, having finished all six, and becoming again hungry, comes at\r\nlast to the stone house, where he makes the same hypocritical request, and\r\nmeets the same heroic refusal. He now threatens to blow down the house.\r\n\"Blow away and welcome!\" retorts the little hero. Fox blows \"until his wind\r\ngives out,\" but cannot move the first stone. He then tries scratching and\r\ntearing with his paws, but only succeeds in tearing off two of his own\r\ntoe-nails. \"I will come down your chimney,\" he threatens, leaping as he\r\nsays so to the roof of the house. \"Come soon as you please,\" sturdily\r\nreplies Tiny Pig, standing before his fireplace with a big armful of dry\r\nstraw ready to be thrown upon the fire. As soon as Fox has entered the\r\nchimney, and come down too far to return quickly, Tiny Pig throws the dry\r\nstraw upon the fire, which creates such a blaze that Fox is scorched and\r\nsmoked to death, and Tiny Pig lives the rest of his life in peace, the hero\r\nof his neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThis story certainly furnishes foundation for a moral which we will leave\r\nthe reader to construct for himself, remarking as we pass that, so far as\r\nwe know, no moral has ever been drawn. Several other stories may be\r\nregarded as inculcating, though feebly, some moral precept.\r\n\r\nOne of these bears some features of American negro life, grafted probably\r\nupon African stock: The denizens of a certain farmyard--ducks, geese,\r\nturkeys, pea-fowls, guinea-fowls, hens, roosters and all--were invited by\r\nthose of another farmyard to a supper and a dance. They all went as a\r\nmatter of course, headed by the big farmyard rooster, who strutted and\r\ncrowed as he marched. They were a merry set, and such an amount of\r\nquacking, cackling and gabbling as they made was seldom heard. After a few\r\nrounds of dancing, just to give them a better appetite for supper and fit\r\nthem for a longer dance afterward, they were introduced to the supper-room.\r\nThere they saw on the table a pyramid of eatables high as the old gobbler's\r\nhead when stretched to its utmost; but, alas! it was, or seemed to be, a\r\npyramid of _corn bread_ only--pones upon pones of it, yet nothing but corn\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nOn seeing this the rooster becomes very indignant, and struts out of the\r\nhouse, declaring that he will have nothing to do with so mean a supper, for\r\nhe can get corn bread enough at home. As he is angrily going off, however,\r\nthe others, who are too hungry to disdain even the plainest fare, fall to\r\nwork; and no sooner has the outer layer of corn loaves been removed--for it\r\nis only the outer layer--than they find within a huge pile of bacon and\r\ngreens, and at the bottom of the pile, covered and protected by large\r\ndishes, any amount of pies and tarts and cakes and other good things.\r\n\r\nPoor Rooster looks wistfully back, and is sorry that he had made that rash\r\nspeech. But it is too late now, for his word is out, and no one ever knew\r\nRooster take back his word if he had to die for it. He learned, however, a\r\nvaluable lesson that night, for from that time to this it has been observed\r\nthat Rooster always _scratches_ with his feet the place where he finds, or\r\nexpects to find, anything to eat, and that he never leaves off scratching\r\nuntil he has searched to the bottom.\r\n\r\nOur last story is more purely African, at least in its _dramatis personae_.\r\nBuh Elephant and Buh Lion were one day chatting upon various subjects, when\r\nthe elephant took occasion to say that he was afraid of no being on earth\r\nexcept man. On seeing the big boastful eyes of the lion stretching wider\r\nand his mane bristling, as if in disdain, he added, \"You know, Buh Lion,\r\nthat, although you are held as the most to be dreaded of all beasts, I am\r\nnot afraid of any of your tribe, for if any of them should attack me I\r\ncould receive him on my tusk, or strike him dead with my trunk, or even\r\nshake him off from my body and then trample him to death under my feet. But\r\nman--who can kill us from a distance with his guns and arrows, who can set\r\ntraps for us of which we have no suspicion, who can fight us from the backs\r\nof horses so swift that we can neither overtake him nor escape from him--I\r\ndo fear, for neither strength nor courage can avail against his wisdom.\"\r\n\r\nBuh Lion, on hearing this, shook himself, and said that he was no more\r\nafraid of man than he was of any other creature which he was in the habit\r\nof eating; and added that the only beings on earth he was afraid of were\r\n_partridges_.\r\n\r\n\"Partridges!\" exclaims Buh Elephant in wonder. \"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why this,\" says Buh Lion, \"that when I am walking softly through the woods\r\nI sometimes rouse a covey of partridges, and then they rise all around me\r\nwith such a whir as to make me start. I am afraid of nothing but\r\npartridges.\"\r\n\r\nNot long afterward Buh Elephant heard a gun fired near a neighboring\r\nvillage, followed by a loud, prolonged roar. Going there to learn what was\r\nthe matter, he saw Buh Lion lying dead by the roadside with a great hole in\r\nhis body made by a musket-ball. \"Ah, my poor friend,\" said he, \"partridges\r\ncould never have treated you in this way.\"\r\n\r\nWILLIAM OWENS.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[C] Of the terrible forms of superstition prevalent under the names of Obi,\r\nVoodooism, Evil-eye or Tricking, in which a trick-doctor or witch-doctor\r\nworks against another person's life or health or plans, or seeks to\r\nneutralize the influence of another doctor, our subject leads us to say\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELIM.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Surrender your soul to the spell of enchantment,\r\n        And wander with me\r\n    Where, river of magical fancies, Euphrates\r\n        Flows down to the sea.\r\n\r\n    What city sleeps fair and mysterious by moonlight\r\n        Upon the dark shore?\r\n    Oh, those are the minarets gleaming of Basrah\r\n        That heavenward soar.\r\n\r\n    And bright are her flower-lit gardens, whose fountains\r\n        Unceasingly rise,\r\n    Where oft, when the locust grew shrill and the summer\r\n        Shone red in the skies,\r\n\r\n    The caliph would hasten from camp and from council\r\n        To rest and to dream.\r\n    To forge, in the workshop of silence, such weapons\r\n        As deadliest gleam.\r\n\r\n    And with him came Selim, the friend of his spirit--\r\n        Friend favored and true--\r\n    Whose palace of marble Euphrates encircled\r\n        With girdle of blue.\r\n\r\n    There oft by the murmuring waters the caliph\r\n        Would calmly recline,\r\n    And mark how the stars on that earth-sullied bosom\r\n        Seemed trembling to shine,\r\n\r\n    Until, as one evening the moon rose serenely,\r\n        Fair pearl of the sky,\r\n    And filled with her presence the palace and desert,\r\n        The far and the nigh,\r\n    A trouble which hung On the aspect of Selim\r\n              Fell dark on his king,\r\n    As clouds 'twixt the sun and the sand-billowed ocean\r\n              Their dusky shapes fling.\r\n\r\n    \"O friend of my heart!\" quoth the caliph, \"what sorrow\r\n              Lies deep in thy breast?\"\r\n    And Selim, replying, the source of his anguish\r\n              Thus humbly confessed:\r\n\r\n    \"Great lord of my being! life trembles and quivers\r\n              With fulness of joy:\r\n    The rays of my hopes are as gold in my pathway,\r\n              Undimmed by alloy;\r\n\r\n    \"Thy banners float far on the breezes of India,\r\n              Thy counsels are wise;\r\n    The thoughts of thy valor and strength to thy people\r\n              As light to their eyes;\r\n\r\n    \"Yet still, in the midst of thy glory and power,\r\n              Thou deignest to rest\r\n    Thy soul on the soul of thy servant, whom daily\r\n              Thy favors have blest,\r\n\r\n    \"Till he who once couched on his sheepskin reposes\r\n              On cushions of down,\r\n    And holds a fair wife in his arms who had only\r\n              A steed for his own.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus over the heaven thy grace has illumined\r\n              No shadow appears,\r\n    Save one, at whose coming thy servant unworthy\r\n              Shrinks, falters and fears--\r\n\r\n    \"The shadow of Azrael, angel of terror,\r\n              Surpassingly strong,\r\n    The roar of whose onrushing wings soundeth louder\r\n              Than laughter or song;\r\n\r\n    \"Till I, even I, from the conflict of battle,\r\n              The scimitar's sweep,\r\n    Turn cowering, fearful of glory's last service\r\n              And manhood's best sleep.\r\n\r\n    \"Behold! now the heart of thy servant is open,\r\n              And bare to thy view.\"\r\n    Then slowly the caliph replied, while his gaze sought\r\n              The firmament blue:\r\n\r\n    \"Dread Prophet of Allah! thou knowest my spirit,\r\n              My heart and my life;\r\n    Thou knowest the desolate years of my manhood,\r\n              Their unended strife;\r\n\r\n    \"Thou knowest that never a friend have I cherished\r\n            Save only this one,\r\n    And now I have lost him; but, Allah il Allah!\r\n            Thy will still be done!\"\r\n\r\n    Then, turning, the caliph departed, and Selim,\r\n            Like one drunk with wine,\r\n    Arose all unconscious and turned to his dwelling,\r\n            His heart's inmost shrine,\r\n\r\n    And followed the gleam of his lamp to the chamber\r\n            Where, sheltered and calm,\r\n    She peacefully slumbered who faithfully loved him--\r\n            That wild heart's \"sweet balm.\"\r\n\r\n    One arm half encircled her baby, who sturdily\r\n            Clenched his round fist,\r\n    And lay with his rosy lips parted and eager,\r\n            As though lately kissed;\r\n\r\n    While over them both her soft tresses, all fragrant,\r\n            Had rolled in their play:\r\n    How fair and how childish they looked in the moonlight,\r\n            Scarce purer than they!\r\n\r\n    One moment stood Selim, while over his being\r\n            Hell's bitterness passed:\r\n    The next, and his dagger flashed forth like the lightning,\r\n            And fell like its blast.\r\n\r\n    And Selim was wifeless and childless! In silence\r\n            He stood by the bed\r\n    Where still lay the wife and the child in the moonlight--\r\n            Not sleeping, but dead.\r\n\r\n    One moment he gazed at the faces, still peaceful,\r\n            Still tender, still fair,\r\n    Then fled to the desert, whose vastness could only\r\n            Give space to despair.\r\n\r\n    But when, in the red eastern morning, the caliph\r\n            Stood sternly alone,\r\n    And watched the proud river, now mournful for ever\r\n            For all that was gone,\r\n\r\n    Lo! Selim knelt calmly before him: \"Great caliph!\r\n            Behold now thy slave,\r\n    For Azrael, angel of death, have I conquered\r\n            And bound in the grave.\"\r\n\r\n                  ANNIE PORTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH DOMESTICS AND THEIR WAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn American lady, on coming to England and observing the workings of\r\ndomestic life, is apt to think English servants perfection, and to listen\r\nto any complaints of them which she may hear with an ill-concealed smile.\r\n\"What! complain of these excellent, admirable, respectful, hard-working\r\nservants!\" she exclaims to her English friends. \"If you could only see what\r\nwe have to endure from these women in our American households, then indeed\r\nyou would appreciate the quiet and efficient hand-maids whose services you\r\ncan command here in the mother-country.\" And, to make good her case against\r\nthe \"help\" which hinder our happiness so much in America, she will speak of\r\nthe high wages given them, the kind treatment they receive, the ingratitude\r\nwith which they take all favors, their inefficiency, and so on.\r\n\r\nBut after a short sojourn in England our American lady will see many things\r\nin respect to the duties and demands of English servants which were not\r\nquite apparent to her at first; and by dint of observation she will soon\r\nbecome aware that an English servant has privileges and requirements which\r\nwould be thought excessive in our country. In the first place, no English\r\nservant will do any washing and ironing, not even for herself. Everything,\r\ndown to the smallest towel, must be done up by the laundress. Some servants\r\ngo so far as to stipulate what amount of linen, etc. they may have\r\nlaundried each week; and in the case of \"nice young persons,\" who like to\r\nkeep themselves neat and fresh with light calico dresses and tiny white\r\ncaps and spotless collars and large white aprons, the bill for the\r\nservants' washing is apt to swell into quite an item. Again, all English\r\nservants exact either beer or beer-money. (How surprised an American\r\nhousekeeper would be if a new aspirant for the situation of cook or\r\nchambermaid should say, \"Do you supply me with lager, or give me money to\r\nbuy it myself?\"!) After various struggles with the difficulties presented\r\nby this beer question, the generality of English housekeepers have come to\r\nthe conclusion that it is better to give beer-money than to furnish beer to\r\ntheir servants. When money is given it is likely not to be spent for beer\r\nat all, which is quite as well; whereas if there is a servants' cask of\r\nbeer on tap in the kitchen, there are constant disputes as to how much has\r\nbeen drunk, given away or wasted. The usual allowance for beer when money\r\nis given is a shilling a week--a sum which in theory means twenty-five\r\ncents of our money, but in actual practice, as prices now range, we may\r\ncalculate as representing about fifty cents. Thus, fifty cents for beer,\r\nand certainly fifty cents more for personal laundry-work, add a dollar a\r\nweek to the wages of each servant. It is impossible to calculate the cost\r\nof the family washing and ironing, but whatever it be, it must come out of\r\nthe housekeeper's pocket; for, as I have said, no servant will do it. Five\r\ndollars a week is not a large calculation for the laundry-bill of a family,\r\nespecially if there are children. In America this money is generally saved,\r\nbut at what a price!--the house in disorder with wash-tub and ironing-board\r\nduring the beginning of every week, grumbling from all servants, anxiety on\r\nthe part of the members of the family about overcrowding the soiled-linen\r\nbasket, and often the clean clothes sent up \"not fit to be seen.\"\r\n\r\nAnother privilege which I find English servants possess, and which I\r\nconfess surprises me, is that of inviting friends to tea at the mistress's\r\nexpense. Every Sunday evening one or another servant holds a symposium of\r\nchoice spirits below stairs, for whom flows the infusion of the costly leaf\r\nfrom far Cathay. No meat is allowed at these repasts, but tea, milk, sugar\r\nand bread and butter are permitted to be offered. There is going on now an\r\nearnest effort to put a stop to this practice. Economical housekeepers\r\nvery justifiably object to paying for treats to their servants' company.\r\nBut the custom has been handed down from the feudal days, when drinking and\r\neating were the only amusements within the scope of even the very rich, and\r\nwhen every soul who in a friendly spirit passed the castle-walls was\r\nwelcome to all he could gorge or swill, or carry away in his two arms for\r\nthose he had left behind in his poor cottage. In what is known now as\r\n\"noble houses\" the practice is still in force to a great extent. Does\r\nmaster or mistress receive a call? Then wine and sweet biscuits are at once\r\nto be carried into the drawing-room to beguile the caller's tedium in\r\nwaiting. Has a tradesman brought a package? Give the good man a mug of\r\nbeer. Have you come in a cab, and kept it standing outside? Here, quickly\r\ntake out some beer in a pewter tankard to comfort Cabby, which he tosses\r\noff as he sits perched on the high seat of his hansom. In houses as lavish\r\nas this a veritable banquet is served each day in the servants' hall, to\r\nwhich the upper servants have the privilege of inviting their friends. And\r\nso the custom goes on, dwindling in costliness until it reaches the homes\r\nof people in fairly comfortable circumstances, who are struggling, but\r\nalmost in vain, to crush it. The trouble is, that when an English servant\r\nenters a house where giving tea to her friends is not allowed, she is apt\r\nto receive such pressure from her mother, who has been probably a servant\r\nin the \"good old days,\" and other conservative domestics of the lavish\r\nschool, that she will make the matter square by slyly appropriating that\r\nwhich she believes should have been legitimately given; and once in this\r\npath her peculations are apt to extend to things more valuable than bread\r\nand tea. This is a great pity, for as a rule English servants are as honest\r\nas the sun. There is not one drop of that Chinese blood which sets the\r\nalmond-eyed John to pilfering everything he can lay hands on flowing in\r\nthese honest Saxon veins. Of course there are always exceptions to any\r\nrule, but for these exceptions there exists in England that inflexible\r\nsystem of punishment by law whose motto most emphatically is, \"It is a sin\r\nto steal a pin.\" To be a thief in England is as poor a business as one\r\nwould wish to follow.\r\n\r\nIn engaging a cook in England you find that she makes many demands you\r\nnever heard of in America. I have alluded to the refusal of all such\r\nservants to have any hand in the laundry-work. In rich households\r\n(especially in the country) a laundress and laundry-maid are regularly\r\nemployed, who have no work of any kind to do outside the laundry: they wash\r\nand iron for the household, including the servants. In cities, however, and\r\nin small families even in the country, the washing is generally done by a\r\nlaundress outside. No cook would tolerate washing and ironing anywhere\r\nabout the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe next imperative demand your cook will make will probably be to ask you\r\nif you keep a scullery-maid or an \"under-servant.\" If your purse will not\r\npermit this luxury, what \"assistance\" is your cook to be furnished with?\r\nThis means, is she to have a \"charwoman\" once a week or oftener for the day\r\nto clean pots and pans, scrub steps and passage-ways, and scour, dust and\r\nrub up generally in the kitchen and rooms adjoining? In England this\r\ncleaning business is far more formidable than with us. We lay down so much\r\noilcloth on our stairways and passage-ways, paint or cover with carpeting,\r\nmatting or oilcloth so many floors, that it is rather an infrequent\r\nexperience to see our servants down on their hands and knees scrubbing away\r\nfor dear life. Even in neat Philadelphia, where there is so much of brick\r\nsidewalk and of marble doorstep to be cleaned, the use of hose and broom\r\nhas to a great extent superseded the scrubbing-brush oiled with\r\nelbow-grease. But in England there are so many stone floors and steps to be\r\nscrubbed, so much brass-work to be cleaned and polished, so many steel\r\ngrates, with tongs, poker and shovel, to be brightened till you can see\r\nyour face in them, that it is no wonder your cook would like to have\r\nassistance in these heavy manual exertions.\r\n\r\nLadies in England have found that when the work in their houses is such\r\nthat assistance must be had, it is better to keep an \"under-servant\" for\r\nthe cook (a position even less exalted than the \"scullery-maid\" in this\r\ncomplex system of domestic gradations) than to have a charwoman come\r\noccasionally. We have no special name for the \"charwoman\" in America,\r\nunless it be simply the generic term, \"a woman,\" or, to be Victor Hugoish,\r\nthe woman who cleans. Char (pronounced _chair_) is simply the old-fashioned\r\nword still popular in New England, _chore_, and the charwoman is merely the\r\nwoman who does chores. English ladies say she does other and more\r\nobjectionable things. She drinks, for instance, and finds it necessary to\r\nbring a basket with her, which, they think, would be found to be more\r\nweighty on leaving (if the matter were tested) than it is when she arrives.\r\nAnother favorite plan for lightening labor, even with families who are in\r\nmoderate circumstances, is to keep a \"Buttons,\" a useful little urchin, who\r\nis forced to make himself respectable in appearance by wearing a livery\r\nprovided for him, the distinguishing feature of which is its lavishness in\r\nthe way of buttons. This boy is expected to do anything and everything--to\r\nclean boots, fetch coal, run errands, open the door, assist in waiting at\r\ntable, rub up knives and silver; in short, to be at the beck and call of\r\neverybody in the house for each and any duty. He may be called a sort of\r\nlight brigade or sharpshooter on the outposts between the heavy cavalry in\r\nthe kitchen in the shape of cook and the solid infantry which moves with\r\nregular step through the housemaid's set round of duties. And whenever the\r\nwheels of a household in England are found to creak, additional help in the\r\nshape of under-servants is engaged, the matter of the efficiency of the\r\nupper-servants being of course first satisfactorily settled. Here is the\r\nvery kernel of the nut of the question: this it is which makes \"all the\r\ndifference\" between the management of a house say in New York and a similar\r\none in London. A family without children, occupying a brown-stone front in\r\nNew York, will consider that two servants should do all the work of the\r\nhousehold, and do it well. I am not speaking of people who live on the\r\n\"swell\" avenues and keep carriages or give frequent balls and parties: I\r\nmean unpretending people who own or rent a nice three- or four-story house,\r\nand want to live with entire comfort and freedom from rows or disputes with\r\nservants, and expect to be well waited on. They engage cook and\r\nchambermaid--the chambermaid to act also as waitress, both to act as\r\nlaundresses. High wages are given, and when the work is done\r\nunsatisfactorily more money is offered as a bribe, or else there are\r\ndisagreeable scenes, ending with the lady saying hotly, \"Well, if you can't\r\ndo my work, I'll find some one else who can.\" But she is mistaken. She will\r\nnever find two women who can cook, wash, iron, clean, dust, wait at table\r\nand do the work generally of a three- or four-story house as it should be\r\ndone. In a household of that importance in England there would be hired, at\r\nthe least, cook and under-servant, housemaid and Buttons, and all the\r\nlaundry-work put out.\r\n\r\nAnd oh how smoothly life passes in such an English home! How brightly every\r\ninch of brass shines! how well dusted is every article you touch! how clear\r\nis the crystal for table use! how spotless the napery! how noiselessly your\r\nservants move about! how respectfully each addresses the heads of the\r\nhousehold whenever required to do so, not otherwise! It is the very\r\nperfection of service, and a luxurious satisfaction which we in America\r\nrarely get a chance to enjoy. But the times are changing now. It may be\r\npossible that in the future the demand-and-supply market for domestic\r\nservice may have so settled itself that for the money we have hitherto paid\r\nas yearly wages to two only tolerable servants we shall obtain the services\r\nof as many efficient ones as are needful to make our American homes the\r\nequal of those in England for the quiet perfection of their interior\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nOLIVE LOGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERNAN CABALLERO.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years ago there appeared in the _Heraldo_ of Madrid a novel\r\ncalled _La Gaviota_ (\"The Sea-gull\"). Spanish literature at the present day\r\nis poor in novels, and thirty years ago it was much poorer. _La Gaviota_\r\nwas like a tall tiger-lily suddenly appearing among low-growing exotics.\r\nThe book was what the French call a _roman de moeurs_: it was signed with\r\nan unknown name--Fernan Caballero. Nobody knew Fernan Caballero. Madrid\r\nconcluded that it must be one of those great living writers whose names\r\ncould be counted on the first five sticks of a lady's fan. Seville ascribed\r\nit to an author of local fame, and Cadiz was amazed by the fact that\r\nanything so good could come out of Spain. The novel was eagerly read, even\r\nby the Gallicanized element in society, and pronounced a success in all\r\nthings, except that it was not French. Following _La Gaviota_, _La Espana_\r\npublished _Elia_ in its columns: then followed _La Familia Alvareda_, _Una\r\nen Otra_, _Pobre Dolores_, _Lucas Garcia_ and others. It became evident\r\nthat the masked writer was a woman, but not one of those _femmes auteurs_\r\nof whom Louis Veuillot says, with more force than elegance, \"Il me semble\r\nque si ma femme signait tels livres, j'aurais scrupule a signer ses\r\nenfants.\" Her thoughts were pure and high, and every detail was gifted with\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish public was not particularly pleased to discover that its\r\nadmired Fernan was a woman. If Cervantes had been a woman, there would have\r\nbeen a precedent for it; but Cervantes was a man. Fernan Caballero's\r\nreaders would have wavered in their allegiance had her stories not become a\r\npart of themselves. It was unfortunate that a woman should write such\r\nthings. \"A blue-stocking!\" cries Don Judas Tadeo Barbo, representative of\r\nthis feeling, in _Una en Otra_. \"Ave Maria! A woman who writes and rushes\r\ninto print! It is a mortal sin! A woman has as much business to write a\r\nbook as a man would to have a baby. And a pretty woman, too! Who would have\r\nbelieved it? A woman who writes should be old, ugly and decrepit.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the attention excited by her stories, she was still tenacious\r\nof her mask. In a letter to Germonde de Lavigne, one of the French\r\ntranslators of her works, she said: \"It was cruel of you to tear away my\r\npseudonym. You know how much I value it. You perhaps wished me to make a\r\nbuckler of my fan; but, believe me, the beautiful things I have gathered do\r\nnot need it. I have not tried to put into my stories studies of the heart\r\nor the world: there is neither art nor invention nor inspiration, only the\r\nexact painting of our actual society. Spanish types of all classes, the\r\nmanners, the feelings, the witty and poetical language, I have painted from\r\nthe life. My personality and my name are things outside of these. All that\r\nI have written is true. I cannot invent: I possess only the talent of\r\ndovetailing facts and placing them in relief. I have passed my life in\r\ncollecting those treasures of tradition, poetry, stories, legends, pious\r\nand poetic beliefs which make an atmosphere of picturesque purity--proverbs\r\nlike Sancho's, maxims as beautiful as Don Quixote, couched in the forcible\r\nand flowery language of the people. I am as proud as an artist of the\r\nbeauty of my model. The story of _Lucas Garcia_ is true; I have known Simon\r\nVerde; an old woman told me the story of the lottery in _La Estrella_; in\r\n_Una en Otra_ everything is true. I have caught nearly all my dialogues\r\nfrom the lips of the people who spoke them. I have gleaned the last grain\r\nfrom a beautiful field, already growing desolate. I have made a sheaf,\r\ndespised perhaps to-day, although the world has gathered some corn-flowers\r\nwhich fell from it, but which some day will be appreciated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like Sir Walter Scott,\" says M. de Mazade in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_,\r\n\"Fernan Caballero has a lively feeling for the traditional and local in\r\nregions of which she writes. Her first and only inspiration is Spain. She\r\nloves even its miseries, which are not without their grandeur. Her\r\ncreations, her characters, her combinations, have no reflection of\r\nimitation: they are taken from the heart of the national life. They proceed\r\nfrom an observation of the reality and a feeling of the poetry of\r\nthings--two sentiments which, balancing each other and uniting, form true\r\nand original invention.\r\n\r\n\"Another trait in this rare talent,\" continues M. de Mazade--\"a trait in\r\nwhich the imagination of the woman is shown--is the absence of complication\r\nin her tales: they have none of those hard knots that bind up action.\r\nFernan Caballero has a genius for details. She makes everything live. She\r\nhas an intuition of a thousand shades, often imperceptible to ordinary\r\neyes, which give each mood of Nature a distinct physiognomy. Like Sir\r\nWalter--more than Sir Walter Scott--she enjoys digressions, sinuous\r\nconversations; she abandons herself to them with delight; she draws\r\npictures and portraits, full of freshness, one after the other; she is\r\nprodigal of all that can throw light on manners or character. She passes\r\nwith graceful ease from the refinements of the aristocratic world to the\r\nmost humble scenes of popular life.\"\r\n\r\nAn author, it seems, is never _sui generis_ in the estimation of the\r\ncritics. Fernan Caballero, compared by M. Merimee to Sterne and by others\r\nto Scott, imagined that if her talent was similar to anybody's it was like\r\nEmile Souvestre's; but her models and method were as much like Souvestre's\r\nas Spain is like France. Fernan Caballero--or, as she was known in real\r\nlife, Dona Caecilia de Baer, marquesa de Arco-Hermosa--may be compared,\r\nreservedly, to Miss Mitford. It is true that fiery thoughts and violent\r\npassion are not to be found in Miss Mitford's beautifully-enamelled\r\nminiatures; but fire and passion were not apparent in the English life she\r\npainted, while in the works of the Spanish artist passion glows under the\r\nsimplest forms, as the red of an orange among its leaves and blossoms. It\r\nhas been truly said of Madame de Baer that she gave a new world to Castile\r\nand Leon--an Andalusian world--almost Arcadian in its newness and\r\nsimplicity. She showed to the world that the Spain of thirty years ago was\r\nstill the Spain of Don Quixote. \"What was true yesterday,\" she quotes from\r\nCalderon, \"is true to-day.\" Our Don Quixote is not the Spanish Don Quixote.\r\n\"Sir Roger de Coverley, Sir Charles Grandison and Don Quixote,\" said\r\nColonel Newcome, \"are the finest gentlemen in the world.\" The Spaniards see\r\nin Don Quixote something higher. \"In Cervantes,\" says Madame de Baer, \"the\r\nmind stifled the heart. It was not his heart that made of Don Quixote a\r\nthing for laughter. Neither the casque of Mambrino nor the love of\r\nMaritornes makes me laugh: it makes me weep.\"\r\n\r\nProgress--as the word is generally understood--also makes her sad. The\r\nAndalusian, surrounded by a world of poetry and beauty, is happy in his\r\nignorance. He reads sermons in the lives of animals, poems in the trees,\r\nmaxims and proverbs everywhere. Why should he read them in books? In _La\r\nGaviota_, Frederick Stein, a German surgeon who has been thrown upon the\r\ncharity of some Spanish peasants, hears a shepherd mention an infallible\r\ncure for pain in the eyes. Stein asks where this remedy is to be found.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you,\" answered the shepherd: \"I know that there is such a\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who can find it, then?\" asked Stein.\r\n\r\n\"The swallows,\" said Jose.\r\n\r\n\"The swallows!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. It is an herb called _pito real_, which nobody knows or sees\r\nexcept the swallows. When their little ones lose their sight they rub the\r\nlittle eyes with the _pito real_, and cure them. This herb has also the\r\nvirtue of cutting iron and everything it touches.\"\r\n\r\n\"What absurdities this Jose swallows like a real shark!\" cried Manuel,\r\nlaughing.--\"Don Frederico, he actually believes that snakes never die.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they never die,\" said the shepherd gravely: \"when they see death\r\ncoming they escape from their skin and run away. When old they become\r\nserpents: little by little scales and wings appear. They become dragons,\r\nand return to the desert.--But you, Manuel--you do not wish to believe\r\nanything. Do you also deny that the lizard is the friend of man? If you do\r\nnot believe it, ask Miguel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without doubt. He was sleeping in a field; a snake glided near him; a\r\nlizard, which lay in the furrow, saw the snake, and presented itself to\r\ndefend Miguel. The lizard was large, and it fought with the snake; but\r\nMiguel not awaking, the lizard pressed its tail against his nose, and ran\r\noff as if its paws were on fire. The lizard is a good little beast: it\r\nnever sleeps in the sun without descending the wall to kiss the earth.\"\r\n\r\nImagination in the Andalusian supplies the place of knowledge. He has a\r\nprecedent for everything. Tradition is the light that guides his feet. Let\r\nhim alone, says Fernan Caballero. Would he be happier if his wants were\r\ngreater--if his life were less simple? Would he be happier if he believed\r\nless? If he thinks, with the good Maria in _La Gaviota_, that the Jews\r\nformerly had caudal appendages, and that they are only now prevented from\r\nwearing them by the ring that governs in place of the queen, _qu' importe_\r\nso long as a sick Jew will be treated as tenderly as a sick Christian? If\r\nyou could alter their ardent natures, if you could cut out the firm love\r\nthat often changes to fierce jealousy and deadly hate, you would improve\r\nthem and lessen crime; but that you cannot change until you can change the\r\nclimate. Change Spain to England, and you can have schools, trades-unions,\r\nand all the modern improvements; but while Spain is Spain you of the North\r\ncan neither understand nor reform her.\r\n\r\nAnd strange it is that this author, who has identified herself with Spain,\r\nis not Spanish. Her father was John Nicolas Boehl de Fabre, who migrated\r\nfrom Hamburg to Cadiz: to him Spain owes a collection of ancient poetry,\r\n_Floresta de Rimas Antiquas Castellanas_. His daughter Caecilia was born in\r\n1797 at Morges in Switzerland. The publication of her first work was due to\r\nthe advice and encouragement of Washington Irving. She first wrote an\r\nexquisite idyl of Andalusian life, _The Alvareda Family_, in German, and\r\nthen translated it into Spanish. Irving admired it in manuscript, and\r\ninduced her to go to work on another, which appeared under the title of _La\r\nGaviota_--a title borrowed from its wild and untamable heroine, Marisalada\r\nSantalo. This second story at once made her reputation in Europe. It stands\r\nat the head of her numerous works. The character of the uncontrollable\r\nheroine is developed as by a master-hand, and the handling of the story\r\nuntil it culminates in Marisalada's passion for Pepe Vera and the despair\r\nof her husband, Stein, is graphic and almost too pitiless. Don Modesto,\r\ncommandant of Fort San Cristobal, is worthy of the hand of Cervantes. The\r\nauthor has received the greatest compliment that unliterary Spain could pay\r\nher: a complete edition of her works was issued--_not_ at the expense of\r\nthe queen--by Don Francesco de Mallado at Madrid.\r\n\r\nMadame de Baer was married three times; so, besides her three cognomens, it\r\nis well that she has one that will always be remembered--Fernan Caballero.\r\nDuring the reign of Isabella she occupied apartments in the Alcazar of\r\nSeville, but after the revolution she removed to the Calle de Burgos, where\r\nshe lived quietly among those lifelong friends, her flowers and books.\r\nDuring her last illness the ex-queen and the duke and duchess de\r\nMontpensier were her frequent visitors. She died on the seventh of April of\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\nM. F. E.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OCTROI.\r\n\r\nThose travellers who, after an excursion to the suburbs of Paris, see their\r\ncarriage stopped by an official in a green tunic with silver buttons, who\r\nasks solemnly, \"Have you anything to declare?\" are usually far from\r\nimagining that they are witnessing a manifestation of one of the most\r\nimportant of the Parisian financial functions. For such undoubtedly must\r\nthe _octroi_ be considered. It is the tax that supports Paris--that pays\r\nfor her improvements, her cleansing, her lighting, her poor-fund--that\r\nsupports the hospitals, keeps her pavements and sewers in repair, and, in a\r\nword, pays all her necessary expenses. It encircles Paris as with an iron\r\nhand; it watches at every gate, at every quay, at every entrance-point to\r\nthe city; it is for ever on the alert to discover fraud. One hundred and\r\ntwenty-five officers and three thousand subordinates are employed in\r\ncollecting this colossal tax and in guarding against its being evaded. The\r\nrevenue thus produced has amounted during the last few years to over\r\ntwenty-five millions of dollars annually. No wonder that Paris can afford\r\nto beautify herself with new adornments continually. She is a millionaire\r\namong cities, and can pay for new decorations at will.\r\n\r\nThe octroi, in its present form, is a comparatively modern institution. It\r\ndates from the 18th of October, 1798. Before the law was passed Paris had\r\nfallen into a piteous plight. The contractors threatened to cease all\r\noperations; nobody had been paid for a long time; the city was not even\r\nable to pay the pitiful sum of sixteen thousand francs which was owing to\r\nthe street-sweepers. Out of this municipal poverty arose the octroi, and\r\nduring the first year of its functions it produced over a million and a\r\nhalf of dollars. Yet it was far from bringing in at that time all that it\r\nshould have done, owing to the insufficient force of agents employed and\r\nthe gigantic frauds that were perpetrated on all sides. As soon as night\r\ncame the smugglers set to work at all the unprotected points--and they were\r\nmany--of the fortifications. Ladders were planted against the walls, and\r\nbarrels of wine, bottles of brandy, packets of butcher's meat, etc. were\r\nlowered into the city by means of cords. Subterranean passages were dug,\r\nestablishing a communication between the interior and the exterior of the\r\ncity. It was not till the reign of the First Napoleon that these abuses\r\nwere definitely suppressed.\r\n\r\nNearly every article of daily consumption that enters Paris is taxed by\r\nthe octroi--meat, wine, spirits, fruits, vegetables, ice, wood, coal,\r\netc.--and also all building materials. It has been estimated that the\r\noctroi-tax on an edifice in Paris that costs twenty thousand dollars\r\namounts to one thousand dollars. The largest part of the revenue is\r\nacquired from wines and spirits. Wine pays about twenty-three francs on the\r\nhectolitre: it is taxed by quantity, and not _ad valorem_; which is an act\r\nof crying injustice to the poor man, whose cup of _petit bleu_ must pay as\r\nmuch as does the goblet of old Burgundy of the millionaire. One of the\r\nheaviest taxed of all articles is absinthe, owing to the desire of the\r\nauthorities to suppress the use of it as much as possible. After all claims\r\nupon it are acquitted a bottle of absinthe will be found to have been\r\ncharged nearly four hundred per cent. on its original value.\r\n\r\nThis law, which strikes not only absinthe, but all other kinds of liqueurs\r\nand of spirits, with excessive duties, was passed in 1871, and the effects\r\nwere immediately manifest, only sixty thousand hectolitres of alcohol being\r\nbrought into Paris in 1872, against one hundred and sixty-nine thousand in\r\n1871. The immense consumption of absinthe, which just before the war was so\r\nmarked a feature of the cafe-life of Paris, has now greatly decreased. But\r\nto make this temperance movement on the part of the French authorities\r\nfully effectual, the tax on _vin ordinaire_ should have been taken off\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nThese heavy duties have naturally called into being among the quick-witted\r\nFrench an active system of frauds against the octroi; and that is not the\r\nleast interesting part of the question to study. Against these petty\r\nsmugglers a band of picked officials, selected for their probity and\r\nintelligence from among the whole force of the service of the octroi, has\r\nbeen organized. Eighteen among these act as detectives. They wear no\r\nuniform, assume various disguises, and are well acquainted with all the\r\nmysterious nooks of Paris and with all the holes and corners of the\r\nsuburbs. They seem to scent out a fraud as a hunting-dog does game. Thus,\r\na few years ago two huge blocks of Swiss granite passed the barriers\r\nunquestioned. Some keen-witted detective immediately asked himself why and\r\nfor what purpose had those great masses of stone been brought from such a\r\ndistance. He prowled about them for a little while, observed a curious\r\ndepression in one end of the largest block, and ended by discovering that\r\nboth were hollow and were packed full of contraband goods.\r\n\r\nThe custom-house authorities have formed a museum of the most curious of\r\nthe objects that have been captured whilst passing the barriers, and that\r\nwere constructed for the purposes of fraud. The list is an interesting one,\r\nand reflects great credit upon the ingenuity of the smugglers, if not upon\r\ntheir honesty. False busts worn by make-believe wet nurses, false abdomens,\r\nhats with double crowns, hollow horse-collars, footstools lined with tin,\r\ncarriage-seats concealing tin boxes, etc., etc., abound. There, too, may be\r\nseen a pile of pieces of linen fastened together with a cord, each of which\r\nis simply a box of zinc covered with linen. This trick was really\r\ningenious, and was detected in a very odd way. The wagon that conveyed this\r\nmerchandise into Paris was marked on the side \"Toiles et Nouveautes,\" and\r\nthe letters struck the custom-house agents as being a great deal too large\r\nand conspicuous. Hence arose suspicion and a thorough examination.\r\n\r\nThe museum also preserves among its curiosities an ordinary-looking cab,\r\nwhich is a hollow structure made of painted tin. There, too, are to be seen\r\npiles of common plates, as innocent-looking as it is possible for crockery\r\nto be. The first half dozen plates are all right: the rest are perforated\r\nand conceal a tube of tin. It will be seen that all these contrivances are\r\ndirected toward the smuggling of one article--namely, spirits.\r\n\r\nThe product of the octroi averages about sixty francs per annum for every\r\ninhabitant of Paris. It is an indirect income-tax which is exacted from\r\nevery dweller in the city. Unfortunately, its operations weigh heavily only\r\non the very poorest classes. The banker of the Faubourg St. Honore or the\r\nnoble of the Faubourg St. Germain troubles himself very little about the\r\nextra price that he is thus forced to pay for his salmon or his chambertin.\r\nBut among the very poor, those whose daily expenditure is counted not by\r\nsous, but by centimes, this tax is very severely felt. It is argued,\r\nhowever, that the poor man profits even more by the product of this tax\r\nthan does the rich one, the hospitals, for instance, being chiefly\r\nmaintained by its means.\r\n\r\nL. H. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN LEADERS IN RUSSIA AND TURKEY.\r\n\r\nThere is an old regimental tradition, which meets the Eastern traveller at\r\ntimes in Egyptian hotels and Indian mess-rooms, that an English interpreter\r\nin the Turkish service, being present at a conference between his pasha and\r\na Russian general, was just commending the two as \"admirable specimens of\r\ntheir respective races,\" when suddenly General Kormiloff and Selim Pasha,\r\nafter staring at each other for a moment, broke out simultaneously, \"Eh,\r\nDonald Campbell, are _ye_ here?\"--\"Gude keep us, Sandy Robertson! can this\r\nbe _you_?\"\r\n\r\nThis is merely a grotesque version of an actual and very significant\r\nfact--viz. that both the Russian and his hereditary enemy have achieved\r\nmany of their greatest triumphs under the command of foreigners. The\r\nprominence of the latter in the military history of both nations is of\r\nconsiderable antiquity. As early as 1397, Sultan Bajazet formed the\r\nChristian captives of Nikopolis into the formidable brigade whose title of\r\n_Yengi Scheri_ (\"new soldiers\") gave rise to the terrible name of\r\n_Janissary_; while several of the earlier czars in like manner surrounded\r\nthemselves with a foreign body-guard. Coming down to later times, we find\r\nthe Tartar Skuratoff acting as the right-hand man of Ivan the Terrible\r\n(1531-84). In the ensuing century the Russian centre at Smolensk was\r\ncommanded by the terrible Sir Thomas Dalziel of Binns, afterward the\r\nfiercest persecutor of the Scottish Covenanters. Peter the Great's best\r\nofficer was General Gordon, a cadet of the Huntley family, and his best\r\nengineer was M. Lefort, a native of Geneva. The Turkish service, too,\r\ncontained at this time several Swiss and Frenchmen (mostly refugees from\r\nthe religious persecutions of Louis XIV.), some of whom attained high rank.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier part of the eighteenth century the fame of the new military\r\nsystem established by Frederick William of Prussia and his son, Frederick\r\nthe Great, led the sovereigns of Russia to give the most liberal\r\nencouragement to any German officers who could be persuaded to undertake\r\nthe training of their ill-disciplined levies. Among these imported\r\ngenerals[D] the most distinguished was the celebrated Marshal Muennich,\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Russian army under the empresses Anne and\r\nElizabeth, the latter of whom at length banished him to Siberia, whence he\r\nwas not recalled till the accession of Peter III. in 1762. His Russian\r\nsuccessor, Apraxin, was speedily superseded by an Englishman named William\r\nFermor, a distant relation of the beautiful heroine of Pope's _Rape of the\r\nLock_; but the total defeat of this new leader by Frederick the Great at\r\nZorndorf in 1758 ousted _him_ in his turn, and the imperial troops were\r\ncommanded by native Russians up to the end of the Seven Years' War. But\r\nunder the far-sighted rule of Catherine II., who ascended the throne in\r\n1763, the German element began to predominate once more, and speedily\r\nattained such prominence that toward the middle of her reign, before\r\nSuvaroff's formidable renown had raised the prestige of the native stock,\r\nthe proportion of foreign officers (chiefly Germans) in the Russian service\r\nwas estimated at not less than eighty-five per cent. It was in allusion to\r\nthis circumstance that the grim old marshal, himself a Russian _pur sang_,\r\nanswered Catherine's gracious inquiry how she could best reward his\r\nservices by saying, with characteristic bluntness, \"Mother Katrina, make me\r\na German!\"\r\n\r\nAbout the same period several Irish soldiers of fortune, driven from home\r\nby political troubles, appeared in the Turkish ranks, as well as not a few\r\nPoles, dispossessed by the \"second partition\" of their country, and longing\r\nfor a chance of avenging the wrong. Several of these adventurers adopted\r\nthe Mohammedan faith, and, gaining the entire confidence of their adopted\r\ncountrymen, were enabled to inflict considerable injury upon the invading\r\narmies of Russia. But the greatest service rendered to the Crescent by a\r\nforeigner at that time (we might almost say the greatest which it ever\r\nreceived) was achieved in 1802 by the French envoy, Colonel (afterward\r\nGeneral) Sebastiani. When a British squadron lay off Prinkipos Island,\r\nwithin easy reach of Constantinople, threatening it with instant\r\nbombardment, the undaunted ambassador, defying alike the hostile guns and\r\nthe fury of the fanatical mob, calmly set himself to achieve the same task\r\nwhich General Todleben accomplished in the Crimea half a century later.\r\nUnder his vigorous superintendence the city was impregnably fortified by\r\nthe incessant labor of a single week, while a show of negotiation diverted\r\nthe attention of the English admiral; and the hostile squadron, suddenly\r\nconfronted by twelve hundred heavy guns, was forced to retire with\r\nconsiderable loss.\r\n\r\nThe enlightened rule of Alexander I., whose zeal for the improvement of\r\nRussia quickened instead of keeping down his appreciation of foreign\r\ntalent, filled the Russian camp with officers from Western Europe.\r\nBenningsen, the most formidable antagonist of Napoleon in 1807; Pfuhl, who\r\nconstructed the fortified camp of Drissa in 1812; Barclay de Tolly, the\r\nRussian commander-in-chief in the early part of that memorable campaign;\r\nWittgenstein, who bore the palm of valor during the invasion of France in\r\n1814; the great strategist Jomini, who was Alexander's aide-de-camp; and\r\nLangeron, whose storming of Montmartre sealed the fate of Paris,--were all\r\nmen of foreign blood. Even after the accession of the Russomaniac Nicholas\r\nin 1825, the \"over-the-frontier men,\" as the natives emphatically call\r\nthem, continued to hold the same prominent place. The Russian navy, indeed,\r\nwhich in the time of Catherine II. owed to Western Europe the only three\r\ncompetent seamen whom it possessed--Greig, Elphinstone and Dugdale--was by\r\nthis time officered chiefly by native Russians, though still manned by\r\nFinns, Greeks and Livonians; but in the army Count Diebitsch himself, the\r\nhero of 1828-29, and his two principal subordinates, Generals Roth and\r\nRuediger, were of German descent. In the Crimean war the array of foreign\r\nnames on either side was still more striking. Omar Pasha, perhaps the\r\ngreatest general whom Turkey has ever possessed, was a Hungarian deserter\r\nfrom the Austrian army, his true name being Theodore Lattos. The defence of\r\nSilistria was the work of two English subalterns, Lieutenant Nasmyth and\r\nCaptain Butler. Ibrahim Aga, the veteran of Sultan Mahmoud's Egyptian wars,\r\nwas originally Thomas Keith, a gunsmith from the \"Old Town\" of Edinburgh.\r\nOmar Pasha's best cavalry officer in 1853, Iskander Bey, was a Polish\r\nrefugee, by name Michael Tchaikovski, whose stirring war-songs are still\r\naffectionately preserved by his countrymen. Bairam Pasha was merely the\r\nTurkish alias of General Cannon. Among the Russians, again, General\r\nTodleben, incomparably the greatest name of the war on their side, was a\r\nCourlander from Mitau. Prince Paskievitch, the conqueror of Erivan and\r\nbesieger of Silistria, sprang from a Slavonian family in Transylvania.\r\nGenerals von Schilders, Aurep and von Lueders, though Russian subjects, were\r\nall of foreign extraction, as were also Count Osten-Sacken and General\r\nDannenberg.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the present war that the foreign element has asserted itself\r\nmost conspicuously. Whether on the Russian or the Turkish side, almost\r\nevery leader of note is a foreigner. The Turkish fleet is commanded by an\r\nEnglishman, who still retains his own name of Augustus Hobart. Another\r\nEnglishman--the notorious Colonel Valentine Baker, called, like his\r\nbrother, Sir Samuel, \"Baker Pasha\"--heads the cavalry of the army of the\r\nDanube. The sultan's two best engineers, under whose guidance Shumla has\r\nbeen refortified, though now known to fame as Reschid Pasha and Blum Pasha,\r\nwere serving not many years since in the German army as Captains Strecker\r\nand Blume. Mehemet Ali Pasha himself, the late commander-in-chief, is a\r\nPrussian, born in Berlin. Suleiman Pasha's chief of staff is Bielowski, a\r\nPole, known in the Turkish army as General Nihad, and General Mina,\r\nrecently appointed to the command of a cavalry division at Rasgrad, is a\r\nBelgian. On the Russian side, again, Generals Loris-Melikoff and\r\nTergukassoff are Armenians, the former having made his first step to renown\r\nby attracting Count Mouravieff's notice as an active young dragoon officer\r\nin the Kars campaign of 1855. General Oklobschio, who commanded before\r\nBatoum last summer, though for many years in the Russian service, is by\r\nbirth a Montenegrin, and has the rashness as well as the valor of his\r\nwarlike countrymen. Baron Krudener, of Plevna notoriety, comes of a German\r\nfamily which settled in Russia toward the close of the last century. The\r\ngallant Scobeleff is said to belong to the Ayrshire family of Scobie.\r\nGeneral Nepokoitchitski is a Pole. Prince Tcherkasski has a tinge of\r\nTartar, Prince Mirski of Polish, blood. General Gourko springs from a\r\nCossack family of formidable renown in the Turkish and Polish wars of the\r\nseventeenth century; and the family name of General Zimmermann, the leader\r\nof the Dobrudscha army, speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nNor is all this to be wondered at. The Turk and the Russian, closely alike\r\nin many points, are more especially so in this--that both can follow and\r\nneither can lead. In steadfast obedience and endurance of every extreme of\r\nhardship they have no superior on the face of the earth, but the prompt\r\nenergy of the man who is accustomed to think and act for himself in every\r\nemergency is wanting to both. Under the command of a skilful general both\r\nRussian and Turkish troops will advance unflinchingly against the strongest\r\nposition, or hold their ground with that stubborn tenacity which Frederick\r\nthe Great aptly illustrated by saying that \"when you fight with a Russian\r\nyou must kill him first and knock him down afterward.\" But let them once be\r\ndeprived of their leader or lose their solid formation, and their\r\nhelplessness becomes instantly manifest.\r\n\r\nD. K.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTURE OF THE IMPERIAL GUARDS.\r\n\r\nMoscow, Sept. 11 (Aug. 30, Russian style), 1877.\r\n\r\nExcitement here is now a veritable epidemic. Go where you will,\r\ncharity-boxes, designating the purpose for which alms are solicited, and\r\neach boasting the bright crimson cross stamped on a pure white surface,\r\nmeet your eye. They are affixed to the walls of the various _ooclitzas_ (or\r\nroads) traversing this mighty city; they greet you at the entrance of every\r\nchurch and cathedral, the charming little English church occupying a site\r\nin the Tchernetchefsky Perculok forming no exception to the rule; do you\r\nhappen to enter \"Gurin's,\" the well-known Muscovitish restaurant, the\r\nprobability is that your charity \"on behalf of the sick and wounded\" is\r\ninstantly demanded by a lady, who, duly escorted by some member of the\r\n\"nobler sex,\" has taken upon herself the duty of \"begging\" in this\r\nparticular district. The topic of--as also endless incidents attendant\r\nupon--this deplorable war meets one at every point--in the lowest\r\n_peeteny-dom_ (drinking-house); in every shop; in the very _droshky_ which\r\none hires, the driver (_eezvostchik_) being invariably well versed in the\r\nlatest phases of the combat.\r\n\r\nTo-day a fresh impetus has been given by the departure from Moscow, after a\r\ntwo days' stay here, of a portion of the Imperial Guards from St.\r\nPetersburg _en route_ for the field--were it not better to say many\r\nfields?--of battle. This body, numbering about thirty-six hundred officers\r\nand soldiers, was despatched from the modern capital in instalments of six\r\nhundred men. The Guards, it must be remembered, constitute the flower and\r\npride of the Russian army, and it is impossible that they could be regarded\r\nin any other light. A veritable set of giants, so to speak, they one and\r\nall appeared, clad in their rough brown winter gear, with heavy top-boots,\r\nand carrying heavy knapsacks with superfluous pairs of nailed high boots\r\nstrapped thereon.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Imperial Guard dates from the reign of the most\r\nautocratic of the czars. Peter the Great, left fatherless at an early age,\r\nspent his childhood in the village of Preobragensky, situated not many\r\nversts from Moscow, where his greatest delight, as he grew in years, was to\r\nassemble the youths of the village and train them into a fighting corps,\r\nconstituting himself their captain. But the youthful hero was not content\r\nwith this venture. He also made friends with the boys of the neighboring\r\nvillage--Semenovsky by name--and assembled them in like fashion. Hence the\r\nnames attached to the first and second regiments of the _Infanterie de la\r\nGarde_--Preobragensky and Semenovsky. In after-life Peter retained the rank\r\nin early days thus self assumed, remaining captain of his favorite\r\nPreobragensky regiment.\r\n\r\nThe Infanterie de la Garde consists of three divisions, each comprising\r\nfour regiments. The first division, besides the two already named, includes\r\nthe regiments designated as Ismailovsky and the Chasseurs de la Garde. The\r\nregiments of the second division are named, respectively, Pavlovsky, Les\r\nGrenadiers de la Garde, Moscovsky, and De Finlande. The third division\r\nembraces the Volensky and Letovsky regiments, as also those dubbed\r\nL'Empereur d'Autriche and L'Empereur de Prusse. The cavalry has also three\r\ndivisions, the first comprising the four regiments named Les Chevalier\r\nGardes, Les Gardes a Cheval, Les Cuirassiers de l'Empereur and Les\r\nCuirassiers de I'Imperatrice; the second, Les Hussards de l'Empereur, Les\r\nLanciers du Grand Duc Nicolas, Les Grenadiers a Cheval, and Les Dragons de\r\nl'Empereur; and the third, two regiments, Les Lanciers de l'Empereur and\r\nLes Hussards de Grodno.\r\n\r\nSoon after six o'clock A. M., on a bleak and rainy morning, I found my way\r\nin a horribly shaky and shabby droshky to the railway terminus, where the\r\nsoldiers were gathered, many of them accompanied by friends and near\r\nrelations, principally, however, women--mothers, wives and children.\r\nNearly all were seated on the wide platforms stretching in various\r\ndirections. They sat in clusters, some drinking the inevitable _chipeet_\r\n(tea), but perhaps quite as many _votky_ (a kind of brandy). The majority\r\nwere talking fast and gesticulating vigorously in true Russian style. Many,\r\nhowever, were singing and shouting, out of sheer bravado, as it seemed.\r\n\"Yes, they would meet their fate thus. It were better far than weeping; and\r\nthere were but two alternatives: why choose the last named?\" One\r\nbronze-featured Muscovite specially attracted my notice. A burst of noisy\r\nsong--little short of a scream in fact--came from his lips ever and anon,\r\nalternating with a stormy burst of laughter or a sudden flow of tears. I\r\nwatched him with considerable interest. This, I reflected, was a type of\r\nthe wellnigh universal Russian temperament--sad to-day, gay to-morrow: in\r\nthe very depths of despair one moment, brimming over with joy the next. But\r\nthere were other groups; and herein lay another characteristic feature in\r\nthe picture. Here and there a soldier was endeavoring to drown not only his\r\nown feelings, but also those of the surrounding circle, by plunging into\r\nall the wild vagaries of the Russian dance; and furiously his arms as well\r\nas his legs worked to do full justice to the famous national jig. \"Hurrah!\r\nhurrah!\" rang cheerily from the lips of many around, still struggling hard\r\nwith their tears. \"Apait! apait!\" (\"Again! again!\"). Knapsacks lay\r\nscattered all around. The troops were all ready to be summoned at a word\r\nand packed into the various carriages, or rather vans, holding an average\r\nnumber of thirty-five. Alongside the station stood a regiment newly\r\narrived, and waiting to take the place of that which was about to leave.\r\n\r\nWe passed slowly along the line, glancing at the many heavily-laden wagons,\r\nand then at compartment after compartment filled with fine-looking but\r\nhighly-disconcerted horses, rebelling at the restrictions as regarded space\r\nimposed upon them.\r\n\r\n\"I declare I am as utterly sorry for the horses as for the men,\" exclaimed\r\na soft-hearted Russian lady. \"To think of the poor dumb brutes all going\r\nthus helplessly to their fate!\"\r\n\r\nA tent erected for the officers and their friends stood on our left, and,\r\nforming part of a privileged party, we entered it. A long table, supplied\r\nwith the daintiest of viands, provided by the citizens, extended through\r\nits entire length. Many ladies were present, some weeping bitterly. Few\r\nwaited for a formal introduction before exchanging words. \"Your son,\r\nmadame? it is from him you are about to part?\"--\"And my husband, madame.\r\nAll my other sons are there already. May God help and protect\r\nthem!\"--\"Amen!\" is the involuntary answer.\r\n\r\nThe officers--most of them chatting, and many of them even laughing\r\ngayly--are drinking wine, exchanging felicitations and good-wishes, and\r\ntouching glasses across the table. In the midst of all I spied a mouse--a\r\ntame one, surely--careering about at pleasure.\r\n\r\nBut in another minute the aspect of affairs had changed. The word of\r\ncommand had suddenly been given, the officers marched out, the troops\r\ncrouched in such numbers on the platforms rose promptly to their feet,\r\ngrasping their knapsacks; and then the women's arms were bound fast around\r\nthe necks of those stepping, now fast, according to orders, into the\r\ncarriages immediately facing them. The notes of the Russian hymn rose and\r\nfell from time to time: many of the voices were more than half choked.\r\n\r\nIn flocked all, the sobbing women left behind, with heads wrapped up in the\r\nthick woollen Russian shawl or extemporized _bashlik_, \"crossing\" their\r\ndeparting friends three times in earnest and true Russian fashion, praying\r\nHeaven to bless them. And then all waited, all was ready: the long line of\r\ncarriages was already moving off.\r\n\r\n\"Preicheit!\" (\"Good-bye!\") rose from the lips of those around, but\r\nthe word was quickly supplemented by another more suggestive of\r\npleasantness--\"Dussvedinia!\" (\"Au revoir!\"), which was echoed again and\r\nagain. The train moved now more quickly. The soldiers shouted, cried and\r\nlaughed alternately, waving their caps in signal of adieu. \"What matters\r\nit?\" shouted one: \"we must all die once.\" The officers grasped firmly the\r\nhands of those yet marching bareheaded by their side along the platform:\r\nthe lonely women left behind, many of them gray-headed, fell, some of them,\r\nsenseless on the ground.\r\n\r\nE. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MISSING ITEM.\r\n\r\nAmong the long and varied list of reasons assigned for the financial\r\nreverses of the past five years, we do not recollect to have discovered the\r\nfalling off of European immigration. This would appear one of the most\r\nobvious and controlling of them all. About a million less have been added\r\nfrom abroad to the population of the Union within that time than the\r\nfigures of a like number of years immediately preceding caused to be\r\nexpected. If, according to the prevailing estimate, each individual thus\r\nacquired is worth a thousand dollars to the country, its aggregate loss in\r\nthis way far exceeds the sum sunk in superfluous railways, to which\r\nextravagance almost exclusively the custom is to ascribe the revulsion.\r\nEight hundred or a thousand millions of money which the country had under\r\nits hands as it were, reckoned among its available assets and used in\r\ngauging the immediate future of its industry, suddenly vanished. The direct\r\nabstraction from its resources of so large an item could not fail to be\r\nseriously felt. It amounts to the reduction of an average State to a desert\r\ncondition--to the loss of twice as many pairs of stout hands as were\r\nsacrificed in the four years of civil war. The homes marked out for them\r\nare desolate, the waste places they would have made to bloom given to the\r\nweeds, the industries which craved them paralyzed, and the wealth they were\r\nto create cancelled.\r\n\r\nSuch is undoubtedly the economic aspect of this check to the movement of\r\nhuman freight upon the Atlantic. Viewed from the politico-social side, its\r\neffects will not be deemed so unfortunate even by those whose confidence in\r\nthe assimilative power of our institutions is most unqualified. A million\r\nand a half or two millions of matriculates at the great modern political\r\nschool is quite a liberal allowance for one decade. Twice the number might\r\npress heavily on the provision made for adequate tuition. The results of\r\nthe course upon those who have already graduated, born at home or abroad,\r\nare not at all too flattering. In the West, where our European guests most\r\ndo congregate, notions are discoverable of a very helter-skelter\r\ndescription upon divorce, the \"rights of labor,\" and religion in the public\r\nschools--notions which, whether sound or the reverse, clearly need settling\r\nrather than additional disturbance. The case is similar in cities and\r\ndensely-peopled districts at the East, where the same element has especial\r\nweight. At the same time, it is difficult to say how far this association\r\nof facts is accidental or necessary and significant. The proportion of\r\ncrotchety agitators among the population of foreign birth we believe to be\r\nactually less than among the natives. Certainly, our most mischievous\r\n\"ringmasters\" in partisan politics have been Americans. Immigrants do not\r\nusually bring that class of men with them. As to the masses, it can rarely\r\nbe said that the European peasant, as he reaches our shores, is calculated\r\nto demoralize his new neighbors in personal and social habits. He is never\r\nintemperate, unless he come from the British Isles, and his tastes and\r\namusements are simple and often refined. We are in the habit of supposing\r\nthat what inferiority the Briton of the lower classes may labor under in\r\nthese respects is made up by his superior political information and\r\ntraining to free institutions.\r\n\r\nThe arrivals on our shores represent so many different nationalities that\r\nthe faults of each may be balanced by the better traits of others, and that\r\nthe chances of good qualities overpowering bad in the resultant compound is\r\ninferable from the exceptionally favorable conditions of life which draw\r\nthem so far from home. They are so many convergent threads of different\r\nstrength and fineness, twisted into one on the Cisatlantic spindle, to be\r\nthen woven into the broad and ever-widening web. The weaving process may\r\npossibly be too much hurried; and that is about the only compensation we\r\nhave for the loss of so many hundreds of thousands of allies in our contest\r\nwith the wilderness.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CRYING EVIL.\r\n\r\nIs there no grand jury for the train-boy? Can he not be presented and\r\nabated as a nuisance? He runs every day the gauntlet of hundreds of these\r\ninquests, strung along the thousands of miles he makes hateful to the\r\ntraveller. Yet he still treads unchecked and unabashed his endless round of\r\nevil-doing. To realize the enormity of the wrong let us fancy him\r\nabandoning his stronghold in the railway carriage and adventuring his raids\r\non terra firma. How long would the most patient of publics endure his\r\npromenading the sidewalk three times an hour each way, and every time\r\nthrusting upon the occupants of every house, at work, at amusement or at\r\nmeals, a package of candy, a semi-rancid orange, or a wholly rancid novel?\r\nHe would be clapped into quod and permanently extinguished before\r\ncompleting his third tour of the square.\r\n\r\nThe railways have no police to do us this good turn. If they have any, this\r\nyouth of the period has purchased their silence. The passenger is handed\r\nover to him like a sheep, his helpless victim, bought with a price. No\r\nmeans of escape are left open. Frowns and cold shoulders are thrown away on\r\nhim. A calm ignoring of his existence is but a spur to his determination to\r\nconquer you. He sets you down as a foeman worthy of his steel. \"Ah, old\r\nfellow!\" he soliloquizes as he takes your measure, \"I'll have you yet. If\r\nyou are not politician enough to want yesterday morning's triple sheet\r\n_Tomahawk_, you will want to bury yourself from my reach in the mazy tables\r\nof last year's _Railway Guide_, or, if not that, you'll be glad, after a\r\nwhile, to let me soothe you with a willow-leaf Havana.\" Revolving these\r\nthoughts, he strolls imperturbably on, for he understands you perfectly, as\r\nhe does all the rest of his various victims.\r\n\r\nDiscouragement is a word he has no use for. He does not seem to sell\r\nanything. Sometimes you will listlessly yet curiously observe his career,\r\nand settle back into your seat in luxurious satisfaction as he emerges\r\nthrough the rear door without having effected a solitary transaction.\r\nBetter still, he caught his basket in the doorway, and spilled some of his\r\noranges under the feet of yon slumbering rustic: no, he recovered himself\r\ntoo soon. He never drops anything except of set purpose--a circular or the\r\nbook it recommends. A passenger will occasionally do it, or be made to seem\r\nto do it, and then have of course to purchase the article under foot; but\r\nthat is a trick of trade, and one the average train-boy is not master of,\r\nthe leaders of the craft only being adepts in it.\r\n\r\nOn some lines the train-boy was formerly utilized in summer by handing\r\nround ice-water to the thirsty at stated intervals. But the thirsty were a\r\nminority: the cans would splash on the sufficiently moist majority, and\r\nthat device for contriving a _raison d'etre_ for the train-boy was\r\nabandoned. He is now more inexcusable and more ubiquitous than ever. He and\r\ncinders are twin evils born of fast schedules. To add four or five miles an\r\nhour to the old rate, station refreshment-booths and platform-peddlers and\r\nspark-catchers have been abolished. The local peanut interest has been\r\nruthlessly immolated on the altar of Hurry, and the incense of the same\r\nrite poured in, thick and black, at every car-window and ventilator. Let us\r\nhope for an early change in the mode of worship. This acolyte is unknown in\r\nEurope. Travellers there manage to lunch, read and smoke very comfortably\r\nwithout him; and they can do it here with perfect ease if similar methods\r\nare adopted for supplying their real wants.\r\n\r\nE.

Translated from the French of\r\n     Charles de Mazade. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons.\r\n\r\nIn this substantial volume M. Charles de Mazade has related in a very\r\ninteresting manner the history of an extraordinarily interesting career.\r\nCavour's career was a short one--the space of eleven years covers the whole\r\nof it, and the shorter space of six years witnessed its most striking\r\nachievements--but it was nevertheless one of the most remarkable and most\r\nactive in the annals of statesmanship. Clearly and harmoniously unfolded as\r\nit is in these pages, it reads indeed like a romance or a fairy-tale: there\r\nseems almost an element of magic in Cavour's inveterate successes. M. de\r\nMazade is a passionate admirer of his hero, and the story loses in his\r\nhands none of its brilliancy of coloring. But it needs no retouching: the\r\nnaked facts themselves are a drama, with all the necessary requisites--the\r\nlarge and moving argument, the skilful performers, the thickening plot, the\r\nmoment of suspense, the happy denouement, the attentive auditory. The work\r\naccomplished by Cavour had a peculiar completeness and unity: it was a\r\nsingle, consistent task cut out for him by circumstances. It is sometimes\r\nsaid of him that circumstances had more part in the result than the man\r\nhimself, and that if they had not happened to combine themselves again and\r\nagain in a peculiarly favorable manner the liberator of Italy would not\r\nhave been known beyond the limits of the quiet little kingdom of Piedmont.\r\nBut M. de Mazade points out that Cavour's greatness was precisely in his\r\nmarvellous talent for making his occasion--for knowing just the way in\r\nwhich to take hold of circumstances. From the day on which, of his own\r\nmoment and as the first step in a far-seeing plan, he sent, in the face of\r\ndomestic opposition, a Piedmontese contingent to the Crimean war, he\r\npursued this vigilant culture of opportunity without faltering or going\r\nastray. M. de Mazade characterizes him as an extraordinary mixture of\r\nprudence and boldness; and these qualities with him always went hand in\r\nhand. He knew equally well how to wait and when to act. But it is the\r\nelement of discretion, the art of sailing with the current of events, that\r\nenabled him to effect a great revolution by means that were, after all, in\r\nrelation to the end in view, not violent--by measures that were never\r\nreckless, high-handed or of a character to force from circumstances more\r\nthan they could naturally yield. For M. de Mazade, Cavour is the model of\r\nthe moderate and conservative liberal. Liberal he was, as a friend said of\r\nhim, \"as he was fair-complexioned, lively and witty--by birth.\" But M. de\r\nMazade constantly emphasizes the fact that his liberalism was untinged by\r\nthe radical leaven, and that if he was a liberator, he had nothing in\r\ncommon with some of the gentry who aspire to this title. All this is very\r\nobvious. Cavour was not only the champion of his country: he was also the\r\nservant of his king, and his dream was to see Italy not only united, but\r\nbrought under the sway of the old Piedmontese crown. He often said,\r\naccording to M. de Mazade, that no republic can give as much liberty, and\r\nas real liberty, as a constitutional monarchy that operates regularly. It\r\nis noticeable that, keeping in view his hero's conservative side, M. de\r\nMazade relates in considerable detail the story of the liberation of Italy,\r\nwith no allusion to Mazzini beyond speaking of him two or three times as a\r\nvulgar and truculent conspirator, and with a regrettable tendency to stint\r\nthe mixture of praise to the erratic but certainly, during a most important\r\nperiod, efficient Garibaldi. But Cavour's nature was a wonderfully rich and\r\npowerful one; and there is something very striking in such religious\r\ndevotion to an idea when it is unaccompanied with fanaticism or narrowness\r\nof view, and tempered with good sense and wit and the art of taking things\r\neasily.\r\n\r\nCavour had had his idea from the first: he cherished it for a long time\r\nvery quietly: he was awaiting his opportunity. \"We will do something,\" he\r\nsaid one day in 1850, rubbing his hands--his legendary gesture--as he\r\nlooked across Lago Maggiore to the Austrian shore. It was not till 1855\r\nthat the first serious opportunity came, but he attached himself to this\r\nwith the quiet zeal and obstinacy of a man who feels that he is driving in\r\nthe narrow end of the wedge. There were all sorts of telling objections to\r\nbe made to the co-operation of Piedmont in the Crimean war, and Cavour was\r\nat the disadvantage, for a man who was rigidly and supremely practical, of\r\nhaving to defend his course on ideal and far-fetched grounds. But his\r\nidealism proved to be plain good sense: it brought little Piedmont to the\r\nnotice of Europe, and gave her the right to call attention to her affairs.\r\nThe young Italian officer spoke the truth who said to a poor soldier\r\nstruggling with the mud in the Crimean trenches, \"Never mind--make the best\r\nof it: with this mud we are making Italy!\" As Piedmont had had a hand in\r\nthe war, so she had a seat at the Congress of Paris which followed it; and\r\nhere Cavour, finding his auditory ready made to his hand, introduced--a\r\nlittle perhaps by the shoulders--the then comparatively novel \"Italian\r\nquestion.\" This was his second opportunity. The emperor Napoleon had asked\r\nhim, from an impulse of imperial civility, \"If there was any thing he could\r\ndo for Italy?\" and Cavour, taking him at his word, and more than his word,\r\nhad instantly drawn up a list of _desiderata_. M. de Mazade gives a\r\ndetailed and very interesting account of the gradual adoption by the\r\nemperor of his Italian policy--of the various phases through which it\r\npassed, of its complications and interruptions, and of Napoleon's curiously\r\nfitful, illusive and at times evasive attitudes. Cavour's relations with\r\nNapoleon III. may serve as the best example of his disposition to use the\r\nbest instruments and opportunities that offered themselves, and not quarrel\r\nwith them because they were not ideally perfect. This was what the Italian\r\n\"patriots\" of the mere romantic type could never forgive: that Italy should\r\nappeal for liberation to the oppressor of France was to them a displeasing\r\nand monstrous anomaly. But Cavour had a lively sense of reality in human\r\naffairs, and for him the best thing was the best possible thing. It was\r\nenough that--for reasons best known to himself--the \"Man of December\" had\r\ntaken a fancy to this idea of lending a hand to the oppressed Peninsula:\r\nhis own duty was to fan the flame. The emperor's sympathy with Italian\r\nindependence is certainly the most interesting and honorable feature in his\r\ncareer, and its mingled motives and mysterious fluctuations present a very\r\ncurious study. The desire to do something for Italy was, however,\r\nsteadfast, and had been an early dream; and the reader of M. de Mazade's\r\npages can easily believe that Cavour's personal influence and magnetism\r\nhad something--had even a good deal--to do with bringing it to a climax.\r\nNapoleon appreciated the Piedmontese statesman, and felt his superiority.\r\nFrom a certain ideal point of view there is something displeasing in seeing\r\nthe advocate of so noble a cause dancing attendance upon an unscrupulous\r\nadventurer, and hanging as it were upon his lips; but we know not what\r\nother ways there may have been: we only know that, in fact, a great deal of\r\ngenerous French blood was shed upon the plains of Lombardy.\r\n\r\nAfter the Congress of Paris, Cavour spent two years of eager, anxious\r\nwaiting and of the most active private agitation. It was by the aid of\r\nEngland and France combined that he proposed to compass his aim, but he\r\nhad, in the case of England, to content himself with a strictly Platonic\r\nsympathy. His mingled ardor and tact during this period, his tension of\r\npurpose, and yet his self-restraint, his inveterate skill in turning events\r\nto his advantage, are vividly narrated by M. de Mazade. At last, in the\r\nsummer of 1858, Napoleon sent for him to Plombieres, drove him out in a\r\ndog-cart, and during the drive told him that he was now ready to \"do\r\nsomething\" for Italy. Then and there the outline of the war of 1859 was\r\nresolved upon. The abrupt conclusion of the war was, at least momentarily,\r\na profound disappointment to Cavour: the Peace of Villafranca, which left\r\nhalf its fruits ungathered, seemed to the Italian party almost an act of\r\ntreachery on the part of the French emperor. Napoleon was, in fact, alarmed\r\nat his work: he had been almost too successful, and he determined to throw\r\nup the game. Cavour, in irritation, disgust and despair, immediately\r\nwithdrew from the ministry, his place being taken by Urbano Rattazzi. The\r\nnew minister presided at that great breaking-up throughout the rest of\r\nItaly for which the expulsion of the Austrians from Lombardy had given the\r\nsignal, and which took place under the direct patronage of Piedmont. The\r\nattitude of the latter state was a very difficult one, and Rattazzi proved\r\nbut half master of the situation: at the end of six months Cavour was\r\nrecalled to power. From this point in his work one step succeeds another\r\nwith a sort of dramatic effectiveness. He was confronted with the constant\r\nnecessity of presenting an unflinching front to Austria; the necessity,\r\nequally imperious, of checking reactionary excesses in Parma and Modena,\r\nBologna and Tuscany; the need of keeping what had been gained, and at the\r\nsame time reaching forth for more; of keeping on good terms with France,\r\nwho had drawn back almost as far as she first advanced; of remaining free,\r\nespecially, from the reproach of meddling with the papacy--an enterprise\r\nfor which the occasion was not ripe; of stimulating England, who had\r\nadvanced in proportion as France withdrew; and of being supremely careful,\r\ngenerally, to commit no faults. The cession of Savoy and Nice brought down\r\nupon Cavour a storm of denunciation, but he had counted the cost, and the\r\nresolution with which he paid the price of Napoleon's assistance was\r\nextremely characteristic of him. It was apparently equally characteristic\r\nof Garibaldi, born at Nice and her most illustrious son, that he felt it a\r\nmortal affront that by this diplomatic bargain he should have been\r\n\"deprived of a country.\" M. de Mazade characterizes very happily Cavour's\r\nattitude during Garibaldi's invasion of the Two Sicilies--his silent\r\ncomplicity, his skill in giving his terrible associate rope, as it were,\r\nand yet keeping him in hand. Cavour did not live to see the last two acts\r\nof his great drama--the occupation of Venetia and of Rome--but they were\r\nonly, as it were, the epilogue: they were implied in what had gone before.\r\nHe died of overwork--broke down in the midst of his labors. Great innovator\r\nas he had been, he was remarkable for the moderation of his attitude toward\r\nthe Church; and the last words he uttered to the good friar who attended\r\nhis deathbed were a repetition of his famous formula--\"Libera chiesa in\r\nlibero stato.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     Egypt as it Is. By J. C. McCoan. New York: Henry Holt &\r\n     Co.\r\n\r\nDuring the three quarters of a century which have elapsed since the French\r\ninvasion a voluminous Egyptian library has been built up, but it is almost\r\nwholly scientific, sentimental or \"entertaining.\" Of the antiquities and\r\nthe natural history of the country, the temples, mummies and crocodiles,\r\nand the humors of Fellah-life, we have been told a great deal. An account\r\nof the condition and prospects of the country from an economic point of\r\nview has remained a desideratum. This seems the less remarkable when we\r\nrecall the fluctuations through which the industry, commerce and politics\r\nof Egypt have passed since Mehemet Ali seized and commenced repolishing\r\nthe sceptre of the Pharaohs and the Ptolemies. He and his four successors\r\nstood forth as the absolute lords of the land; but it was subject not only\r\nto the accidents of their character and policy, but to the capricious and\r\nalmost always mischievous interference of their suzerain the Porte, and the\r\noften beneficial, but never quite disinterested, control of the great\r\nChristian powers.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the past fourteen years has been more palpable than that of\r\nthe preceding half century. The khedive Ismaal succeeded the\r\nreactionary Abbas, who stopped, and, as far as in him lay, nullified, the\r\nwork of Mehemet in 1865. Since that year 971 out of 1126 miles of railway\r\nhave been built; three or four hundred miles of telegraph have grown to\r\nfifty-five hundred; 112 miles of canal have been dug, and a great part of\r\nthe old system deepened or restored; the great Suez Canal, additional to\r\nthat, has been undertaken and completed at a net cost to Egypt of\r\nsixty-seven millions of dollars; the barrage, or damming for irrigation\r\npurposes, of the Lower Nile has been pushed at a cost of five millions; ten\r\nmillions have been spent on the harbor of Alexandria, one upon lighthouses,\r\nwhich make the coast as safe as that of any European power, and half a\r\nmillion on the bridge at Cairo; schools have been multiplied, remodelled\r\nand endowed in like proportion; the judiciary has been recast with the best\r\nresults, so far as time has permitted them to be shown; and the exports,\r\nexcluding the transit-trade, which the opening of the Isthmus Canal has\r\ndiverted from Alexandria, raised from twenty-four millions in 1866 to\r\nsixty-three millions in 1875. The cotton production, created about the\r\nbeginning of the present reign by the civil war in the United States, shows\r\na recovery and re-advance since the loss of that stimulus, shipments from\r\nAlexandria having grown from 1,288,797 quintals in 1866 to 2,615,120 in\r\n1875. The blow dealt the commerce of that city by the transfer of the\r\nIndian trade to Port Said has similarly been \"discounted,\" the mercantile\r\nsagacity of Alexander the Great continuing to assert itself in a movement\r\nof business and population which cannot fail to be largely aided by the\r\nextension of the arable area of Egypt proper and the railway development of\r\nNubia and the Soudan. The population of the first of these three districts\r\nhas grown to five and a half millions, or 484 to the square mile--a\r\ndensity exceeding that of Belgium. Its multiplication, and the more\r\nwonderful advance in the products of its industry, go to support Mr.\r\nMcCoan's assertions of its general well-being. In this regard he maintains\r\nthat the Egyptian peasantry compare favorably with those of any Eastern\r\ncountry. Their mode of life, rude enough in the eyes of Western tourists,\r\nis, he holds, the same as under the builders of Thebes, and much the same\r\nwith what the climate and other local conditions will always make it. Their\r\noppression by the old system of tax-collecting and military conscription\r\nhas been greatly relieved. We cannot see, indeed, why an army nominally of\r\nthirty, but actually of less than twenty thousand, and recruited in great\r\nmeasure from Nubia, should be burdensome. The navy has almost disappeared,\r\na veto from Constantinople having made iron-clads a prohibited luxury, so\r\nthat impressment for the fleet is unfelt.\r\n\r\nMr. McCoan, though generally fair and practical in his statements, tends to\r\nthe rose-colored side of things Egyptian. Thus it fares with slavery.\r\nSlaves, white and black, are very numerous in Egypt, \"nearly all the indoor\r\nwork of every family above the poorest\" being done by slaves. In the town\r\nof Mansourah in 1873 an English consular agent, \"in rank not even a\r\nvice-consul,\" used his power under a then existing privilege to liberate\r\n\"seventeen hundred in a single month.\" Mansourah has but sixteen thousand\r\nof population, so that the slave-element must be great. But Mr. McCoan says\r\nthe institution is strictly patriarchal, and no way comparable to the\r\nextinct Western form. This does not seem to be borne out by his other\r\nstatement, that \"few black slaves (the most numerous by far) reach middle\r\nage, ten or a dozen years generally sufficing to sweep away a generation,\r\nat the end of which the whole have to be replaced.\" And how are they\r\nreplaced? By Arab raids among the negro tribes, costing the death, in\r\nbattle or on the march, of four or five for one that reaches the Nile or\r\nthe Red Sea. The Circassian supply has been brought pretty well to an end\r\nby the Russian conquest of the Caucasus, and is kept up only in a feeble\r\nway by the continued habit of selling their daughters yet prevalent among\r\nthe emigrants from that region who have sought refuge among their\r\ncoreligionists in the interior of Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of Egypt must be affected by the Turko-Russian war; although,\r\nas England is quite able, and seemingly quite determined, to cork up the\r\nDardanelles, it is not likely that the ships of the czar can threaten Port\r\nSaid for generations to come. The interest of the money-changers, too, is\r\nto keep her quiet and the hands of her Fellaheen occupied only with the\r\nimplements of peace--the shovel and the hoe. She is far from warlike, is\r\nindisposed in the extreme to quarrelling with Europe or any part of it, and\r\nshould the Turkish empire go to wreck, will be content to drift out of the\r\nwreck as noiselessly as possible. She will, if allowed a chance, be able\r\nere long to set a shining and valuable example of thrift and liberality to\r\nthe rest of the Moslem world. She has already shown that its crust of\r\nbigotry and case-hardened conservatism may be broken, and nobody of any\r\nfaith be one whit the worse. Her capacity for improvement will not be\r\nquestioned by any reader of this volume, which is the result of a thorough\r\nstudy of her condition and recent progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLIDAY BOOKS.\r\n\r\nThe season for holiday publications has not yet fairly opened, but we\r\nnotice a few of those which have already reached us, hoping to present a\r\ntolerably complete list in our next number.\r\n\r\n_Californian Pictures in Prose and Verse_, by Benjamin Parke Avery (New\r\nYork: Hurd & Houghton), is not a record of travel, but a description of\r\nscenes visited by the author, whose observations extend over a large\r\nportion of California, from Mount Shasta to the Santa Cruz Mountains. It is\r\nwritten in a clear and fluent style, but \"word-painting\" is a form of\r\nwriting requiring exceptional nicety of execution, and Mr. Avery has not\r\nthe power or delicacy of language which would be needed to sustain the\r\ninterest of a volume of this size with little or no aid from incident.\r\nThere is no _sauce piquante_ to set forth attractively the real merits\r\nwhich the volume possesses. A sincere feeling for Nature appears to have\r\nbeen turned by Mr. Avery into the special channel of enthusiasm for the\r\nSierra scenery, which he has studied with loving and minute care. He\r\nexplored no new region, but he went beyond the beaten track, and has sought\r\nto avoid a repetition of the most worn Californian themes. Yet it is to\r\nCalifornians and to those who have visited the State that the book must\r\nchiefly appeal; and to these it may safely be recommended as a memorial\r\nvolume, agreeably written, handsomely got up, and embellished with\r\nillustrations by various artists and engravers, some of Mr. Thomas Moran's\r\nfamiliar light-bathed distances being perhaps the most noticeable.\r\n\r\nThree volumes, bearing the imprint of G. P. Putnam's Sons, are suitable for\r\nchildren of almost any age. Of these, _Six Sinners; or, School-Days in\r\nBantam Valley_, by Campbell Wheaton, is a pleasantly-written story, the\r\nwarm-hearted, clever, impulsive little heroine being very naturally and\r\nsympathetically drawn. There is a good deal of reality in the delineation\r\nof the other characters, and the school in which the sensitive Dora was so\r\nmiserable is no doubt a faithful picture of some boarding-school in New\r\nEngland of twenty years ago. The miseries, though pathetic, are not of long\r\nduration: we take leave in the last chapter of a very happy little girl,\r\nwith friends reconciled and circumstances adjusted in the most delightful\r\nway. The story is nicely constructed, and the interest well sustained, but\r\nthe title seems to have no special fitness beyond that of alliteration.\r\n\r\n_Patsy_ (by Leora B. Robinson) goes through all the stages of girlhood,\r\nfrom pinafores and paper dolls to long dresses and young ladyhood, with\r\nbewildering celerity. We find her on one page learning the Primer along\r\nwith the elements of flirtation, and on the next she is finishing her\r\neducation with all the philosophies and -ologies. There is no lack of funny\r\nincidents in the book, but they are too crowded, and the characters are too\r\nnumerous. This, however, may be no obstacle to children, who have often a\r\nfaculty for unravelling genealogical problems, and like to have their fun\r\nspread thick. They will not even have to skip the moral, which, such as it\r\nis, is aimed entirely at parents and guardians.\r\n\r\n_The Wings of Courage_, adapted from the French by Marie E. Field, with\r\nillustrations by Lucy G. Morse, contains three rather long stories. But why\r\n\"adapted\"? and why is not George Sand acknowledged as the author? There\r\nought to be an authentic translation of Madame Sand's fairy-tales, which\r\nare full of fancy, earnestness and charm. These stories appeal to a more\r\nimaginative and cultured audience of boys and girls than that to which the\r\nrealistic tales of American writers are addressed. The beauty and\r\nsimplicity of the antique will, we fear, appear dull when compared with the\r\nadventures of hoydens and newsboys, and Young America is not partial to the\r\nyoung naturalist unless he justifies the singularity of his pursuit by an\r\nabundance of slaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Books Received._\r\n\r\n\r\nTales from Foreign Tongues, 3 volumes--\"Memories,\" from the German of Max\r\nMueller; \"Graziella,\" from the French of Lamartine; \"Marie,\" from the\r\nRussian of Pushkin.
