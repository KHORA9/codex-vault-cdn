Copies of each paper, in pamphlet form,\r\nare distributed as published to libraries and scientific organizations\r\nand to specialists and others interested in the different subjects. The\r\ndates at which these separate papers are published are recorded in the\r\ntable of contents of each of the volumes.\r\n\r\nThe series of _Bulletins_, the first of which was issued in 1875,\r\ncontains separate publications comprising monographs of large\r\nzoological groups and other general systematic treatises (occasionally\r\nin several volumes), faunal works, reports of expeditions, catalogs\r\nof type specimens, special collections, and other material of similar\r\nnature. The majority of the volumes are octavo in size, but a quarto\r\nsize has been adopted in a few instances in which large plates were\r\nregarded as indispensable. In the _Bulletin_ series appear volumes\r\nunder the heading _Contributions from the United States National\r\nHerbarium_, in octavo form, published by the National Museum since\r\n1902, which contain papers relating to the botanical collections of the\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nThe present work forms No. 174 of the _Bulletin_ series.\r\n\r\n                                               ALEXANDER WETMORE,\r\n                     _Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution_.\r\n  WASHINGTON, D.

life histories of North American birds. Previous\r\nnumbers have been issued as follows:\r\n\r\n  107. Life Histories of North American Diving Birds, August 1, 1919.\r\n  113. Life Histories of North American Gulls and Terns. August 27,\r\n         1921.\r\n  121. Life Histories of North American Petrels and Pelicans and their\r\n         Allies, October 19, 1922.\r\n  126.

Life Histories of North American Shore Birds (pt. 2), March 24,\r\n         1929.\r\n  162. Life Histories of North American Gallinaceous Birds, May 25,\r\n         1932.\r\n  167. Life Histories of North American Birds of Prey (pt. 1), May 3,\r\n         1937.\r\n  170. Life Histories of North American Birds of Prey (pt. 2), August 8,\r\n         1938.\r\n\r\nThe same general plan has been followed, as explained in previous\r\nbulletins, and the same sources of information have been utilized. The\r\nnomenclature of the 1931 check list of the American Ornithologists’\r\nUnion has been followed, but it has seemed best to continue in the same\r\norder of arrangement of families and species as given in the old check\r\nlist (1910).\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made to give as full a life history as possible of\r\nthe best-known subspecies and to avoid duplication by writing briefly\r\nof the others and giving only the characters of the subspecies, its\r\nrange, and any habits peculiar to it. In many cases certain habits,\r\nprobably common to the species as a whole, have been recorded for only\r\none subspecies; such habits are mentioned under the subspecies on\r\nwhich the observations were made. The distribution gives the range of\r\nthe species as a whole, with only rough outlines of the ranges of the\r\nsubspecies, which cannot be accurately defined in many cases.\r\n\r\nThe egg dates are the condensed results of a mass of records taken from\r\nthe data in a large number of the best egg collections in the country,\r\nas well as from contributed field notes and from a few published\r\nsources. They indicate the dates on which eggs have been actually found\r\nin various parts of the country, showing the earliest and latest dates\r\nand the limits between which half the dates fall, the height of the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe plumages are described in only enough detail to enable the reader\r\nto trace the sequence of molts and plumages from birth to maturity\r\nand to recognize the birds in the different stages and at the\r\ndifferent seasons. No attempt has been made to describe fully the\r\nadult plumages; this has been done very well in the many manuals and\r\nState bird books that are now available. The names of colors, when in\r\nquotation marks, are taken from Ridgway’s Color Standards and Color\r\nNomenclature (1912), and the terms used to describe the shapes of\r\neggs are taken from his Nomenclature of Colors (1886). The boldface\r\ntype in the measurements of eggs indicates the four extremes of the\r\nmeasurements.\r\n\r\nMany of those who contributed material for previous bulletins have\r\ncontinued to cooperate. Receipt of material from more than 430\r\ncontributors has been acknowledged previously. In addition to these,\r\nour thanks are due to the following new contributors: Dean Amadon, E.\r\nR. Forrest, Allen Frost, J. J. Hickey, Joseph Janiec, Melvin Johansen,\r\nM. B. Meanley, Jr., R. L. Meredith, E. E. Murphey, A. G. Nye, Jr.,\r\nR. T. Orr, R. S. Palmer, Cordelia J. Stanwood, Wendell Taber, A. E.\r\nThompson, and Mrs. L. J. Webster. If any contributor fails to find his\r\nname in this or in one of the previous lists, the author would be glad\r\nto be advised.\r\n\r\nEgg measurements were furnished especially for this volume by Dean\r\nAmadon, A. M. Bailey, C. E. Doe, J. R. Gillin, W. C. Hanna, H. L.\r\nHarllee, R. C. Harlow, R. T. Orr, J. H. Riley, G. H. Stuart, 3d, and\r\nMiss M. W. Wythe.\r\n\r\nThrough the courtesy of the Bureau of Biological Survey, the services\r\nof Frederick C. Lincoln were again obtained to compile the distribution\r\nparagraphs. With the matchless reference files of the Biological Survey\r\nat his disposal, his many hours of careful work have produced results\r\nfar more satisfactory than could have been attained by the author, who\r\nclaims no credit and assumes no responsibility for this part of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nDr. Winsor M. Tyler rendered valuable assistance in reading and\r\nindexing, for this group, the greater part of the leading periodicals\r\nrelating to North American birds, which saved the author many\r\nhours of tedious work and for which he is very grateful. Dr. Tyler\r\ncontributed the life histories of the northern downy woodpecker and\r\nyellow-bellied sapsucker, Dr. Arthur A. Allen wrote the life history\r\nof the ivory-billed woodpecker, Bayard H. Christy that of the northern\r\npileated woodpecker, and Dr. Eugene E. Murphey that of the red-cockaded\r\nwoodpecker. Thanks are due also to F. Seymour Hersey for figuring the\r\negg measurements.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript for this volume was completed in June 1938.\r\nContributions received since then will be acknowledged later. Only\r\ninformation of great importance could be added. The reader is reminded\r\nagain that this is a cooperative work; if he fails to find in these\r\nvolumes anything that he knows about the birds, he can blame himself\r\nfor not having sent the information to--THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   LIFE HISTORIES OF NORTH AMERICAN\r\n                              WOODPECKERS\r\n\r\n                           ORDER PICIFORMES\r\n\r\n\r\n                       By ARTHUR CLEVELAND BENT\r\n                           _Taunton, Mass._\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Order PICIFORMES\r\n\r\n                 Family PICIDAE: American Woodpeckers\r\n\r\n                  CAMPEPHILUS PRINCIPALIS (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\n\r\n                        IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                              PLATES 1, 2\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 HABITS\r\n\r\n                 CONTRIBUTED BY ARTHUR AUGUSTUS ALLEN\r\n\r\nThe large size and striking color pattern, the mystery of its habitat,\r\nand the tragedy of its possible extinction combine to make the\r\nivory-billed woodpecker one of peculiar interest to all Americans who\r\nhave any pride in the natural resources of their country.\r\n\r\nEver since the days of Mark Catesby (1731) this species has attracted\r\npopular attention, and even at that time, as he stated in his Natural\r\nHistory of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands: “The bills of\r\nthese Birds are much valued by the _Canada Indians_, who made Coronets\r\nof ’em for their Princes and great warriors, by fixing them round a\r\nWreath, with their points outward. The Northern Indians having none\r\nof these Birds in their cold country, purchase them of the _Southern\r\nPeople_ at the price of two, and sometimes three, Buck-skins a Bill.”\r\nAt that time the species was found throughout the Gulf States as\r\nfar north as North Carolina and up the Mississippi Valley as far as\r\nsouthern Ohio and Illinois.\r\n\r\nToday it is almost extinct, and indeed during the past 50 years long\r\nperiods have elapsed when no individuals have been reported from any\r\npart of its range. It apparently has been exterminated from all but\r\na few isolated localities in Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina,\r\nwhere it still clings on in a precarious position.\r\n\r\nThe ivorybill is primarily a bird of the great moss-hung southern\r\nswamps, where mature timber with its dying branches provides a\r\nbounteous food supply of wood-boring larvae, but its habits apparently\r\nvary in different parts of its range, for the birds I observed in\r\nFlorida, although nesting in a cypress swamp, did most of their feeding\r\nalong its borders on recently killed young pines that were infested\r\nwith beetle larvae. They even got down on the ground like flickers to\r\nfeed among palmetto roots on a recent burn. In Louisiana, on the other\r\nhand, the nesting birds observed confined their activities to a mature\r\nforest of oak, sweetgum, and hackberry, and paid little attention to\r\nthe cypress trees along the lagoons.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--At what time the winter groups of ivorybills break up and\r\nspring activities commence is rather difficult to state, for there\r\nseems to be considerable irregularity to the breeding season. Judged\r\nfrom published records of its nests, the period of greatest activity\r\nwould seem to be late March and early April. According to Audubon\r\n(1842): “The ivory-billed woodpecker nestles earlier in spring than\r\nany other species of its tribe. I have observed it boring a hole for\r\nthat purpose in the beginning of March.” Scott (1881) reports taking an\r\nincubating female in Florida on January 20, 1880, and (1888) of finding\r\na nest containing one young female about one-third grown on March 17,\r\n1887. Ridgway (1898) likewise speaks of shooting a male that left its\r\nnest hole February 15, 1898, and Hoyt (1905) states that “in Florida\r\nthey begin building the latter part of January, and if undisturbed the\r\neggs are laid by February 10th.” In 1937 James Tanner (MS.) discovered\r\na nest in Louisiana from which the fledgling left on March 30, fully\r\n2 months earlier than any previous records from the same locality,\r\nand in 1938 apparently the same pair of birds had young the last week\r\nin February. In contrast to these dates we find 10 records of April\r\nnesting, 5 for May, and 1 (Beyer, 1900) of a young bird just out of the\r\nnest in July. The latter records might well constitute second attempts\r\nat nesting. The Florida birds, in general, start earlier than those\r\nin Louisiana, but at best there seems to be less regularity to the\r\ncommencement of the nesting period than is found with most of our North\r\nAmerican woodpeckers. In this, the ivorybill may register its affinity\r\nwith tropical birds in general, the ivorybill being the most northern\r\nrepresentative of an otherwise tropical or semitropical genus. There is\r\nsome evidence for believing that ivorybills wander over considerably\r\nlarger territories in winter than those to which they confine their\r\nactivities in the spring, but little definite information has thus far\r\nbeen recorded on any of their before and after breeding activities.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Nothing seems to have been written on the courtship of\r\nthe ivorybill except the observations of Allen and Kellogg (1937):\r\n\r\n     Our only observations were made In Florida about 6 a. m.,\r\n     on April 13, 1924. We had discovered this pair of ivorybills\r\n     at about the same time the preceding morning when they came\r\n     out of the cypress swamp and preened their feathers and\r\n     called a few times from the top of a dead pine before going\r\n     off together to feed. They had made such a long flight the\r\n     previous day that we were unable to find them again, but\r\n     that night, still traveling together, they had returned to\r\n     the same group of medium-sized cypress trees which they had\r\n     apparently left in the morning and in which there was one\r\n     fresh hole in addition to four or five other old ones in the\r\n     near vicinity. On the morning of the 13th, they called as\r\n     they left these cypress trees and flew to the top of a dead\r\n     pine at the edge of the swamp, where they called and\r\n     preened. Finally the female climbed up directly below the\r\n     male and when she approached him closely he bent his head\r\n     downward and clasped bills with her. The next instant they\r\n     both flew out on to the “burn,” where we followed their\r\n     feeding operations for about an hour.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--As before stated, while there are a few records of February\r\nnesting, the most definite records are for March, April, and early May,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  April 6, ----.

Audubon states: “The hole is, I believe,\r\n     always made in the trunk of a live tree, generally an\r\n     ash or a hackberry, and is at a great height.” There\r\n     are, however, records of their nesting in live cypress,\r\n     partially dead oaks, a dead royal-palm stub, “an old and\r\n     nearly rotten white elm stump,” etc., indicating about as\r\n     great a variety as shown by the pileated woodpecker. The\r\n     lowest authentic nest of which we have found a record,\r\n     was that described by Beyer (1900) “about 25 feet up in a\r\n     living over-cup oak,” although Scott (1881) mentions what\r\n     he considered “an old nest evidently of this species,” in a\r\n     palmetto stub only fifteen feet from the ground. The nest\r\n     which we discovered in Florida, in 1924, was about thirty\r\n     feet up in a live cypress and there were other holes in the\r\n     vicinity in similar trees that had apparently been used in\r\n     years past. The bark had healed over in some cases and scar\r\n     tissue was apparently trying to close the wounds. Of the\r\n     four nests examined in Louisiana, three were in oaks and\r\n     one in a swamp maple. The maple, seven and a half feet in\r\n     circumference (breast high), was partially alive, but the\r\n     top where the nest was located, 43 feet from the ground,\r\n     was dead and pithy. Of those in oak trees, one was in a\r\n     dead pin-oak stub about ten feet in circumference and about\r\n     fifty feet high, standing in more or less of a clearing.\r\n     The nest was 47 feet 8 inches from the ground. The other\r\n     two were not measured accurately but were certainly over\r\n     forty feet from the ground. About the middle of May when it\r\n     was determined that the first two trees had been deserted,\r\n     they were cut down, careful measurements taken, and the\r\n     contents of the holes preserved. The hole in the maple was\r\n     5 inches in vertical diameter and 4⅛ inches laterally,\r\n     and was slightly irregular at the bottom, as shown in the\r\n     photographs; that in the oak was more symmetrical with a\r\n     similar vertical diameter of 5 inches and a transverse\r\n     diameter of 4 inches. The depth of the maple nest from the\r\n     top of the entrance hole was 19⅛ inches, of which 3 inches\r\n     was filled with chips and “sawdust.” This nest cavity was\r\n     8⅛ inches in diameter at the egg level, and the tree itself\r\n     18½ inches in diameter at the level of the hole. The nest\r\n     cavity in the oak was 20 inches from top to bottom with a\r\n     diameter of 8¼ inches at the egg level. The entrance hole\r\n     went in 3 inches before it turned abruptly downward; the\r\n     tree at this point was 22 inches in diameter. There was a\r\n     stub just above the hole in the maple about 4 inches long\r\n     representing a branch that had apparently died and been\r\n     broken off years before and started to heal over. The oak\r\n     was perfectly smooth at the entrance hole, but on either\r\n     side, slightly above, were the bases of two large branches\r\n     that could not have given the opening any protection from\r\n     the weather. The opening in the maple faced north, two of\r\n     those in the oaks east, and one west. Audubon states: “The\r\n     birds pay great regard to the particular situation of the\r\n     tree and the inclination of the trunk; first, because they\r\n     prefer retirement, and, again, because they are anxious\r\n     to secure the aperture against the access of water during\r\n     beating rains. To prevent such a calamity the hole is\r\n     generally dug immediately under the juncture of a large\r\n     branch with the trunk.” None of the nests examined by us\r\n     showed this desire for protection from rain, and the chips\r\n     at the bottom of the cavity were perfectly dry, though we\r\n     had had some very heavy rains shortly before they were\r\n     examined.\r\n\r\n     Audubon further states: “The average diameter of the\r\n     different nests which I examined was about 7 inches within,\r\n     although the entrance, which is perfectly round, is only\r\n     just large enough to admit the bird.” Beyer (1900) says:\r\n     “The entrance measures exactly 4½ inches in height and 3⅞\r\n     inches in width,” and McIlhenny (Bendire, 1895) gives the\r\n     measurements of a typical hole as “oval and measures 4⅛\r\n     by 5¾ inches,” and Scott (1888) as “3½ inches wide and 4½\r\n     inches high.” The corresponding measurements of the nests\r\n     of Pileated Woodpeckers are given by Bendire (1895) as\r\n     follows: “The entrance measures from 3 to 3½ inches in\r\n     diameter, and it often goes 5 inches straight into the\r\n     trunk before it is worked downward.” The additional one\r\n     to two inches in diameter of the nest hole should be kept\r\n     in mind when searching for reasons why the Ivorybill has\r\n     proven less successful than the Pileated Woodpecker in its\r\n     struggle for existence. Thompson (1885) states: “The depth\r\n     of the hole varies from three to seven feet, as a rule, but\r\n     I found one that was nearly nine feet deep and another that\r\n     was less than two.” He also claims that they are always\r\n     jug-shaped at the lower end.\r\n\r\nOf two nests discovered by Hoyt (1905) in Claremont County, Fla., one\r\nwas 58 feet up in a live cypress about 20 yards from a nest discovered\r\nin 1904 by the Brown brothers; the second nest built by the same pair\r\nafter the first eggs had been taken was in a cypress stub about 70\r\nyards distant from the first and 47 feet from the ground. The opening\r\nof the first nest was 6¾ inches by 3¼ inches, with the trunk of the\r\ntree 15 inches in diameter at the nest cavity, which was 14 inches\r\ndeep. The second nest hole measured 6 by 3¾ inches and was likewise 14\r\ninches deep. “The opening in both nests was uneven and rough, and just\r\ninside the hollow was much enlarged, being 9 inches across, and unlike\r\nthe nests of other woodpeckers, was smaller at the bottom than at the\r\ntop. * * * One marked feature of the nest tree of which I have seen no\r\nmention made is that the outer bark of those I have examined was torn\r\nto shreds from a point some distance below the nest site to 15 or 20\r\nfeet above it. This made the nest tree noticeable for quite a distance.\r\nThe last nest taken this season had little of this work done.”\r\n\r\nAllen and Kellogg (1937) say further:\r\n\r\n     According to McIlhenny (Bendire, 1895) the female does all\r\n     the work of excavation, requiring from eight to fourteen\r\n     days, while the male sits around and chips the bark from\r\n     neighboring trees. Audubon, however, states that “both\r\n     birds work most assiduously at this excavation, one waiting\r\n     outside to encourage the other.” Maurice Thompson (1896)\r\n     likewise reports that both birds work at the excavation. We\r\n     had no opportunity to check either statement but certainly\r\n     both birds take part in incubation and feeding the young.\r\n     The chips are not removed from the vicinity of the nest\r\n     for each one that we have examined has had piles of chips\r\n     directly below the opening though, since most of the trees\r\n     were standing in water, the chips were not very conspicuous.\r\n\r\n     We camped within three hundred feet of our first Ivorybill\r\n     nest in Louisiana, in 1935. A pair of 24-power binoculars\r\n     set on a tripod was trained on the nest opening, and from\r\n     daylight, April 10, until 11 a. m., April 14, continuous\r\n     observations during the hours of daylight were made either\r\n     by the writers or by James Tanner. The nest had been found\r\n     the morning of April 6, when the female was incubating, but\r\n     how far along incubation had proceeded we made no effort\r\n     to determine for fear of disturbing the birds. Contrary\r\n     to most published accounts, however, the birds were not\r\n     particularly wary and soon became so accustomed to our\r\n     presence that they would enter the nest-hole with one of us\r\n     standing at the base of the tree and later even when one\r\n     of us was descending from a blind which we built on April\r\n     9 in the top of an adjacent rock elm, twenty feet distant\r\n     from the nest. On April 9, we located a second pair of\r\n     Ivorybills in the vicinity of a fresh hole about fifty feet\r\n     up in a dead oak, some two miles to the south of the nest\r\n     in the maple. The following morning, however, the nest was\r\n     occupied by a black squirrel and the birds had disappeared.\r\n\r\n     Briefly summarizing our five-day vigil at the occupied\r\n     nest, we learned that the birds took turns sitting on\r\n     the eggs, working in approximately two-hour shifts when\r\n     not alarmed, but changing places more frequently when\r\n     disturbed. Activities usually commenced about six o’clock\r\n     in the morning, three-quarters of an hour after Cardinals\r\n     and Carolina Wrens started singing. At this time the female\r\n     relieved the male after his having spent the night on the\r\n     eggs. Activities ceased about four o’clock in the afternoon\r\n     when the male relieved the female on the eggs and went in\r\n     the nest for the night. This was nearly three hours before\r\n     dark, which came about seven o’clock.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--According to Bendire (1895):\r\n\r\n     The eggs of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker are pure china\r\n     white in color, close grained, and exceedingly glossy, as\r\n     if enameled. They vary in shape from an elongate ovate to\r\n     a cylindrical ovate, and are more pointed than the eggs of\r\n     most of our Woodpeckers. They appear to me to be readily\r\n     distinguished from those of the Pileated Woodpecker, some\r\n     of which are fully as large. From three to five eggs are\r\n     laid to a set, and only one brood is raised in a season.\r\n     * * *\r\n\r\n     The average measurement of thirteen eggs is 34.87 by 25.22\r\n     millimetres or about 1.37 by 0.99 inches. The largest egg\r\n     measured 36.83 by 26.92 millimetres, or about 1.45 by 1.06\r\n     inches; the smallest, 34.54 by 23.62 millimetres, or about\r\n     1.36 by 0.93 inches.\r\n\r\nThe eggs described by Hoyt (1905) measured 1.46 by 1.09 and 1.43 by\r\n1.07 inches in the first set and 1.43 by 1.10 and 1.43 by 1.08 inches\r\nin the second set.\r\n\r\nFrom my own experience and the observation of others, it seems to\r\nme that the number of eggs laid by the ivorybill would not normally\r\nexceed three, and one or two of these are often infertile. Frequently,\r\nif the bird is successful in rearing any offspring at all, a single\r\nyoungster is the result rather than two or three. Allen and Kellogg\r\n(1937) describe three nests in which no young were successfully reared,\r\nalthough at least some of the eggs apparently hatched, while Scott\r\n(1888), Beyer (1900), and Tanner (1937 and 1938 MS.) each report single\r\nyoung, and in the type set of three eggs (Ralph collection, Lafayette\r\nCounty, Fla.) two were infertile, and both of Hoyt’s sets contained two\r\neggs each. On the other hand, J. J. Kuhn reports seeing one pair of\r\nivorybills with four young in 1931 and again in 1936 in the same forest\r\nwhere Allen and Kellogg made their studies. In 1932, 1933, and 1934 he\r\nobserved a pair of ivorybills with two young.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--So far as I have been able to find, no one has ever\r\npublished a description of the natal or juvenal plumages of the\r\nivory-billed woodpecker. The probability is that natal down is\r\nabsent, although. Scott (1888), who found a nest containing one young\r\nin Florida March 17, 1887, says: “The young bird in the nest was a\r\nfemale, and though one-third grown had _not yet opened its eyes_. The\r\nfeathers of the first plumage were apparent, beginning to cover the\r\ndown, and were the same in coloration as those of the adult female\r\nbird.”\r\n\r\nDuring April 1937, James Tanner, recipient of the Audubon fellowship\r\nat Cornell University for the study of the ivory-billed woodpecker\r\n(MS.), was able to follow a young ivorybill for over 3 months after\r\nit left the nest, and though he never had the bird in his hands, his\r\ndescription is much more complete than Scott’s and the most accurate\r\none available: “March 10, 1937: The young ivory-billed woodpecker just\r\nout of the nest resembled an adult female in general pattern but with\r\nthe following differences: The black crest was short and blunt; the\r\ntail was short and square; the outer primaries were all tipped with\r\nwhite, instead of being wholly black as in the adult; the bill was\r\nshorter than that of an adult and was chalky white instead of ivory;\r\nthe eye was a dark brown or sepia. One month later the crest was long\r\nbut still blunt and black, the tail was almost as long and pointed as\r\nan adult’s, and the eye and bill were beginning to turn color.\r\n\r\n“The bird developed gradually from then, until at three and a half\r\nmonths out of the nest (July 14, 1937) its size, proportions, bill, and\r\neye color were the same as those of an adult. By then, scarlet feathers\r\nhad appeared in the back of the crest. The white wing tips to the outer\r\nprimaries were almost worn away.”\r\n\r\nSince Tanner’s bird began to show red in the crest when it was three\r\nand a half months old, it is probable that the postjuvenal molt is\r\ncompleted by early fall and that thereafter young and adults are\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\nThe chief difference between adult male and female ivorybills lies in\r\nthe crest, which in the male is a brilliant scarlet, not including the\r\nuppermost feathers, which are black, like the top of the head, while\r\nthe somewhat recurved crest of the female is entirely black. Females\r\naverage somewhat larger than males in most of their measurements,\r\nexcept those of bill and feet, as the following figures (length in\r\nmillimeters) given by Ridgway (1914) for 15 males and 11 females\r\nindicate:\r\n\r\n     ADULT MALES: Skins, 420-493 (454); wing, 240-263 (255.8);\r\n     tail, 147-160.5 (154.4); culmen, 63-72.5 (68.2); tarsus,\r\n     42.5-46 (44.2); outer anterior toe, 30-34 (32.1).\r\n\r\n     ADULT FEMALES: Skins, 452-488 (471); wing, 240-262 (256.4);\r\n     tail, 151-166 (159.5); culmen, 61-67.5 (64.3); tarsus,\r\n     40.5-44 (42.6); outer anterior toe, 30-33.5 (31.7).\r\n\r\nIn both sexes the general color is a glossy blue-black, with the tail\r\nand primaries duller or with the gloss less distinct. A narrow stripe\r\non each side of the neck, starting below the eye and continuing down\r\nto the folded secondaries, is conspicuously white, as are also the\r\nsecondaries, all but five or six of the outermost primaries, and the\r\nunder wing coverts. The white nasal plumes and anterior edges of the\r\nlores more or less match the ivory-white bill and help to emphasize its\r\nsize. The iris is pale, clear lemon-yellow in both sexes, and the tarsi\r\nand toes are light gray.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Audubon (1842) mentions grapes, persimmons, and hackberries as\r\nfood of the ivorybills in addition to beetles, larvae, and large grubs.\r\nMcIlhenny, in his communication to Bendire (1895), mentions their\r\nfeeding on acorns, but Maurice Thompson (1885) asserts that “it is\r\nonly woodpeckers which eat insects and larvae (dug out of rotten wood)\r\nexclusively.” Allen and Kellogg (1937) report:\r\n\r\n     We were never able to follow a bird continuously through\r\n     the forest of either Louisiana or Florida for more than\r\n     an hour before it would make a long flight and we would\r\n     be unable to find it again. Ordinarily upon leaving the\r\n     nest-tree or its immediate environs the bird would fly at\r\n     least a hundred yards before stopping. Then it would feed\r\n     for from a few minutes to as long as half an hour on a dead\r\n     tree or dead branch before making a short flight to another\r\n     tree. It might make a dozen such short flights and then,\r\n     without any warning and for no apparent reason, it would\r\n     start off on a long flight through the forest that would\r\n     take it entirely out of sight.\r\n\r\n     Audubon states that “it seldom comes near the ground”;\r\n     but the birds we have watched behave no differently from\r\n     pileated woodpeckers in this respect, sometimes working\r\n     high up in the trees but at other times within five or ten\r\n     feet of the ground. The female of the Florida pair which we\r\n     watched for over an hour on a “burn” sometimes got down on\r\n     the ground around the seared, prostrate trunks of the saw\r\n     palmettos, hopping like a Flicker, while her mate stayed on\r\n     the trunks of the pines five to ten feet up. We never saw\r\n     the Louisiana birds on the ground but there was plenty of\r\n     evidence, both in Florida and Louisiana, that a bird will\r\n     continue scaling the bark from recently killed trees for\r\n     the beetle larvae beneath, clear to the base of the tree,\r\n     until the tree stands absolutely naked with the bark piled\r\n     around its base.\r\n\r\n     Frequently they return again and again to the same tree\r\n     until they have entirely stripped it. At one time we\r\n     thought this was their chief method of feeding, but we have\r\n     since watched them digging for borers exactly like hairy\r\n     or pileated woodpeckers. At one time we watched the female\r\n     working at a deep gash in the tall stub of a dead gum,\r\n     which was apparently a favorite feeding place. She clung\r\n     to the spot for about five minutes, occasionally picking\r\n     hard, but never chipping off any large flakes that would\r\n     account for the depth of the hole which was exactly like\r\n     that made by pileated woodpeckers,--about four inches deep\r\n     and eighteen inches long. Finally she flew and disappeared\r\n     in the direction of the nest which was about two hundred\r\n     yards away. In a few minutes the male ivorybill came to the\r\n     same spot where the female had been working and he, too,\r\n     picked at the hole and stayed there for several minutes. At\r\n     the time we decided that either the ivorybills or perhaps\r\n     the pileateds had made the gash in the tree for carpenter\r\n     ants and that the ivorybills were returning each time for\r\n     more ants. Since the stub was rather rotten and full of\r\n     woodpecker drillings, we decided to cut it down the next\r\n     day and make certain of what the ivorybills were securing.\r\n     Upon examining the hole made by the birds there was,\r\n     however, no evidence of carpenter ants, and the deep gash\r\n     followed the tunnels of large, wood-boring beetle larvae\r\n     (Cerambycidae) of which there were a great many in the\r\n     tree; the only other available woodpecker food was termites\r\n     of which there were comparatively few.\r\n\r\n     Certainly the ivorybills did not do enough digging while\r\n     we were watching them to uncover any additional borers, so\r\n     they may have been picking up such termites as appeared in\r\n     the gash. The birds, while we watched them in Louisiana,\r\n     divided their time between dead branches of live trees and\r\n     completely dead trees, but more time was spent knocking off\r\n     the bark for whatever could be found immediately beneath\r\n     it than was spent digging deeply for borers. The forest\r\n     was made up primarily of oak, gum and hackberry, and the\r\n     woodpeckers showed no preference for species so far as we\r\n     could determine. In Florida, while the nest was located\r\n     in a cypress swamp in a live cypress tree, the birds\r\n     apparently did most of their feeding in the dead pines\r\n     at the edge of the swamp, scaling off the bark of those\r\n     small and medium-sized pines that had been killed by fire,\r\n     or actually getting down on the ground like Flickers, as\r\n     already described.\r\n\r\nThe ivorybills are, therefore, apparently somewhat adaptable in their\r\nfood and feeding habits, but forests of mature trees with their dying\r\nbranches seem to give them the best habitat for securing their food.\r\nThe fruits of these trees may likewise add considerably to their\r\nattractiveness. The only definite stomach analyses published are of two\r\nbirds examined by the United States Biological Survey, and reported\r\nupon by Beal (1911): “One stomach contained 32 and the other 20 of\r\nthe wood-boring cerambycid larvae, which live by boring into trees.\r\nThese constituted 37.5 per cent of the whole food. The remainder of\r\nthe animal food consisted of engraver beetles (_Scolytidae_) found\r\nin one stomach. Of these, three species were identified--_Tomicus\r\navulsus_, _T. calligraphus_, and _T. grandicollis_. The total animal\r\nfood amounted to 38.5 per cent. The vegetable food consisted of fruit\r\nof _Magnolia foetida_ in one stomach, and of pecan nuts in the other.\r\nThe average for the two was 61.5 percent.”\r\n\r\nThe ivory-billed woodpecker is represented in the Biological Survey’s\r\ncollection by the stomachs of three birds. Two of these were males\r\ncollected on November 26, 1904, at Tarkington, Tex., by Vernon Bailey,\r\nand the third was shot at Bowling Green, West Carroll Parish, La., on\r\nAugust 19, 1903, by E. L. Moseley.\r\n\r\nThe first two stomachs were well filled, and though only the content of\r\nthe third was received it was apparently well filled also. This last\r\nstomach alone contained a trace of gravel. Forty-six percent of the\r\nfood was animal in origin, long-horned beetles (Cerambycidae, including\r\n_Parandra polita_ and _Stenodontus dasystomus_) comprising 45.33\r\npercent, while the remaining 0.67 percent consisted of 3 different\r\nspecies of engraver beetles (_Tomicus_ spp.). Southern magnolia seeds\r\n(_Magnolia grandiflora_) formed 14 percent of the vegetable food,\r\nhickory (_Hicoria_ sp.) and pecan (_Hicoria pecan_) nuts formed 27\r\npercent, and poison ivy (_Rhus radicans_) equaled 12.67 percent.\r\nFragments of an unidentified gall formed 1 percent of the content.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The uniform direct flight of the ivorybill resembles that\r\nof the red-headed woodpecker more than it does the swooping undulating\r\nflight of the pileated, and this general resemblance is emphasized\r\nby the large amount of white in the wings. When viewed from below,\r\nthe long pointed tail is quite conspicuous and the wings seem very\r\nnarrow because the black portion is so much more conspicuous than the\r\nwhite, which apparently cuts off the whole rear of the wing. This is\r\nperhaps not so conspicuous when viewed from the side, but even so it\r\nis remarkable how ducklike the bird can appear as it flies swiftly\r\nand directly up a lagoon, so much so in fact that certain Louisiana\r\nhunters have told me that they have even shot at them under such\r\ncircumstances, mistaking them for ducks. In this connection Audubon’s\r\n(1842) description of the flight of the ivorybill is quite misleading:\r\n“The flight of this bird is graceful in the extreme, although seldom\r\nprolonged to more than a few hundred yards at a time, unless when it\r\nhas to cross a large river, which it does in deep undulations, opening\r\nits wings at first to their full extent and nearly closing them to\r\nrenew the propelling impulse. The transit from one tree to another,\r\neven should the distance be as much as a hundred yards, is performed\r\nby a single sweep, and the bird appears as if merely swinging itself\r\nfrom the top of the one tree to that of the other, forming an elegantly\r\ncurved line.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Concerning the voice of the ivorybill there seems to be\r\nconsiderable agreement in that the ordinary note sounds like a single\r\nblast from a tin trumpet or a clarinet. In the words of Audubon, “Its\r\nnotes are clear, loud, and yet rather plaintive. They are heard at a\r\nconsiderable distance, perhaps half a mile, and resemble the false,\r\nhigh note of a clarinet.” According to Hoyt (1905): “It is a single\r\nnote and resembles the word Schwenk, at times keyed very high, again\r\nsoft and plaintive, it lacks carrying capacity and can rarely be\r\nheard over 100 yards on a still morning, while the harsh notes of the\r\npileated woodpecker can be heard a full mile.” Allen and Kellogg (1937)\r\nstate that anyone can produce the sound very accurately by using only\r\nthe mouthpiece of the clarinet. They question whether the loudest calls\r\ncan be heard half a mile:\r\n\r\n     It is doubtful, however, if the loudest calls can be heard,\r\n     under normal conditions, for a quarter of a mile, and some\r\n     of the weaker ones are scarcely audible at 300 yards.\r\n     However, when we tested the carrying power of one of our\r\n     recordings of the common alarm note, _kent_, amplified\r\n     until it sounded to our ears normal at about one hundred\r\n     feet, the call was distinctly recognizable at a distance\r\n     of 2,500 feet directly in front of the amplifier with no\r\n     trees or buildings intervening. At a 45-degree angle the\r\n     sound was not recognizable at half this distance. The\r\n     birds are so often quiet for such long periods that we can\r\n     scarcely agree with Audubon’s statement that “the bird\r\n     spends few minutes of the day without uttering them.” They\r\n     seem much more likely to call when they are alarmed, as\r\n     when they discover an intruder in their haunts. Both birds\r\n     give the call, but that of the female is somewhat weaker.\r\n     In addition to this _kent_ note, as it is called by the\r\n     natives of Louisiana, and because of which they call the\r\n     birds “Kents,” they have a variety of low conversational\r\n     notes when they exchange places at the nest, which are\r\n     suggestive of similar notes of the Flicker; but they\r\n     never, so far as we know, give a call at all similar to\r\n     the _pup-pup-pup_! of the pileated, nor have we ever heard\r\n     them sound a real tatoo like other woodpeckers, such as\r\n     described by Thompson (1885), and which McIlhenny (Bendire,\r\n     1895) compares to the “roll of a snare drum.” The birds\r\n     in Florida and all those in Louisiana telegraphed to each\r\n     other by single or double resounding whacks on the trunk\r\n     or dead branches. Mr. Kuhn who has had years of experience\r\n     with them, likewise has never heard any notes or tatoos\r\n     that were comparable with those of the Pileated. Our\r\n     observations agree with Audubon’s, rather than with those\r\n     of some others, in that “it never utters any sound while on\r\n     the wing.”\r\n\r\nTanner (MS.) reports, however, that in his studies during 1937 he\r\noccasionally heard a rapid succession of “kents” given on the wing as\r\none bird flew in to join another.\r\n\r\nThe calls of the two large species of woodpeckers are so distinct\r\nthat they should not be confused with each other or with those of any\r\nother birds. The fact, however, that ivorybills are continually being\r\nreported, even from the Northern States, indicates how unobservant many\r\npeople are and how necessary it is to stress even such conspicuous\r\ndifferences as those mentioned above.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Ivory-billed woodpeckers are apparently not only\r\nnonmigratory but also sedentary and perhaps spend their entire lives\r\nwithin a few miles of the spot where they were hatched. At least, once\r\na pair has established a territory it seems to cling to that area\r\nwinter and summer, and Tanner (MS.) reports one pair using the same\r\nroosting hole in December that they used the preceding April. These\r\nterritories are doubtless several miles in diameter, but the tendency\r\nwas for the birds to build up small communities in certain areas\r\nuntil in former years, when their distribution was normal, they were\r\nreported as fairly common by observers who happened upon one of these\r\ncommunities. On the other hand, there were perhaps always large areas\r\nof similar timber uninhabited by them, so that with equal truth by\r\nequally competent observers they were called extremely rare. How much\r\nfarther they range during the winter than during the nesting season has\r\nnot yet been worked out, but doubtless the area covered at such times\r\nis considerably larger, and this accounts for sporadic records of birds\r\nin the nonbreeding seasons in areas where no nests have been located\r\nand where no one has been able to find the birds subsequently.\r\n\r\nThe family groups apparently keep together until the following nesting\r\nseason, and Mr. Kuhn has reported seeing groups of from three to five\r\nbirds even as late as early March. Hoyt (1905) states that “after the\r\nyoung leave the nest in April they and the parents remain together\r\nuntil the mating season in December. During the summer they are always\r\nfound in bands of three to five, and I have never seen more than the\r\nlatter number.”\r\n\r\n_Conservation._--Arthur T. Wayne (1910) records having “encountered\r\nmore than two hundred of these rare birds [in Florida] during the years\r\n1892, 1893, and 1894.” Today it is doubtful if there are a fourth of\r\nthat number left alive in its entire range.\r\n\r\nA number of theories have been advanced for the increasing scarcity\r\nof the ivorybill, that most often mentioned being the destruction of\r\nits natural habitat, the virgin cypress and bottomland forests of the\r\nSouth. Commercialization, avarice of collectors, shooting for food by\r\nnatives, predation by natural enemies that can enter its hole (but not\r\nthe pileated) are likewise suggested, while Allen and Kellogg (1937)\r\nsuggest that with increasing scarcity because of their sedentary\r\nhabits, inbreeding and lack of sex rhythm resulting in weak young and\r\ninfertile eggs have become increasingly important. At this writing the\r\nNational Association of Audubon Societies has established a Fellowship\r\nat Cornell University for the study of the ivorybill, and it is hoped\r\nthat the incumbent, James Tanner, may ascertain such facts regarding\r\nthe bird and its habits that constructive measures for its preservation\r\ncan be undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--The Southeastern United States; nonmigratory.\r\n\r\nThe range of the ivory-billed woodpecker extends =north= to\r\nnortheastern Texas (Gainesville); southeastern Oklahoma (Caddo);\r\nnortheastern Arkansas (Newport and Osceola); southeastern Missouri\r\n(Little River); southeastern Illinois (Mount Carmel); southern Indiana\r\n(Monroe County and Franklin County); and southeastern North Carolina\r\n(Wilmington). =East= along the coast from North Carolina (Wilmington)\r\nto southeastern Florida (Cape Florida). From this point the southern\r\nlimits of the range extend westward along the Gulf coast to Texas\r\n(Guadalupe and New Braunfels). =West= to eastern Texas (New Braunfels,\r\nSan Marcos, Brazos River, and Gainesville).\r\n\r\nThe range of the species has been so restricted in modern times that\r\nperiodically it is feared the bird is on the verge of extinction. It\r\nis now known to exist only in a very few remote areas, chiefly in\r\nLouisiana.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--Florida: 4 records, March 4 to April 19.\r\n  Louisiana: 5 records, March 6 to May 19.\r\n  Georgia: 2 records, April 6 and 10.\r\n  Texas: 2 records, April 11 and May 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                DRYOBATES VILLOSUS VILLOSUS (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\n                       EASTERN HAIRY WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                                PLATE 3\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 HABITS\r\n\r\nThe hairy woodpecker, with its various subspecies, ranges throughout\r\npractically all the timbered regions in North America, but the type\r\nrace, the subject of this sketch, is confined, during the breeding\r\nseason at least, to the Transition and Upper Austral Zones of\r\nNortheastern United States and extreme southern Canada.\r\n\r\nIn the region where I am most familiar with it, southern New England,\r\nit is not an abundant bird at any season, quite rare in summer and\r\noftener seen in winter. It is essentially a retiring, forest-loving\r\nbird, being found with us in summer in the dry deciduous woods, or\r\noccasionally in rural districts in old orchards near the borders of\r\nwooded areas. In winter, it is given more to wandering into villages\r\nand towns, or may be seen even in the shade trees in larger cities.\r\n\r\nI remember having found it only twice in swampy woods, but Dr. George\r\nM. Sutton (1928b), in his paper on the birds of Pymatuning Swamp,\r\nCrawford County, Pa., says: “The hairy woodpecker occurs only rarely in\r\nthe higher deciduous woods outside the borders of Pymatuning during the\r\nnesting season, but it is abundant everywhere in the wooded Swamp, and\r\nin the restricted area, closely examined in 1922, was considered one of\r\nthe most numerous species.”\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Francis H. Allen has sent me the following notes on this\r\nsubject: “The courtship dance consists of a weaving motion of the head,\r\nas with the flicker, accompanied by a high-pitched _ch’weech, ch’weech,\r\nch’weech_, repeated over and over vociferously. The note is much like\r\nthat of the flicker, but higher-pitched and more rapidly delivered.\r\nThree and sometimes four birds may be seen so engaged together, but I\r\nhave no observation as to the sexes. In quiet intervals in courtship,\r\nthe head is held with bill parallel with the axis of the body, not at\r\nright angles as in feeding.”\r\n\r\nEdward H. Forbush (1927) writes:\r\n\r\n     On bright March days this bird begins to practise what\r\n     is either a love song, a challenge, a call to its mate,\r\n     or all combined. This is no vocal music but instead a\r\n     loud drumming on some resonant dead tree, branch, or\r\n     pole. This long roll or tattoo is louder than that of the\r\n     downy woodpecker, not quite so long, and with a slightly\r\n     greater interval between each succeeding stroke. It takes a\r\n     practiced ear, however, to distinguish between the drumming\r\n     of these two species. In courtship the male chases the\r\n     female from tree to tree with coaxing calls, and there is\r\n     much dodging about among the branches and bowing to each\r\n     other before the union is consummated.\r\n\r\nRex Brasher (1926) writes:\r\n\r\n     Seated under a cluster of small maples, one day in early\r\n     May, I watched the interesting courting antics of the\r\n     pair. The jaunty male’s favorite position was one in which\r\n     he appeared to be almost standing on his tail. With bill\r\n     upright, wings thrown forward, and tail wide-spread he\r\n     repeated over and over what was undoubtedly intended for a\r\n     love-song, a series of notes divided between chuckles and\r\n     whistles. But the strangest, most mystifying performance\r\n     was a series of backward drops on the under side of a limb\r\n     inclined about forty-five degrees. * * * Why didn’t the\r\n     little acrobat fall when he released his claws? Studying\r\n     his movements carefully through the binoculars, I came to\r\n     the conclusion that at the instant of releasing his grip he\r\n     jerked his body toward the limb with sufficient impetus to\r\n     catch the bark six inches or so below.\r\n\r\nLewis O. Shelley says in his notes: “I have watched the act of\r\ncopulation of the hairy woodpecker and noted its dissimilarity to the\r\ndowny. For the hairy invariably instills a follow-up procedure to the\r\ndisplay, the male coming to her call and, soon thereafter, hopping up\r\nthe branch toward her with a short jerking movement, in which he calls\r\n_wick-up, wick-up, wick-up_, wings agitating, this immediately followed\r\nby copulation.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The hairy woodpecker is rather rare, as a breeding bird,\r\nin my home territory in southeastern Massachusetts, but I have the\r\nrecords of 12 local nests. It shows a decided preference for deciduous\r\nwoodlands, six of the nests being in dry, upland woods and two in\r\nmaple swamps; of the other four nests, three were in apple orchards,\r\nclose to extensive woodlots, and the fourth was in a small, living,\r\nred maple in a swampy meadow, some distance from any woods. The birds\r\nshowed no decided preference for any one species of tree; three nests\r\neach were found in maples and apple trees, two each in chestnuts\r\nand poplars, and one each in a dead oak and a dead beech. Only four\r\nnests were in dead trees or dead branches; the others were all in\r\nliving hardwoods. The heights from the ground varied from 5 feet in\r\na dead poplar stub to 30 feet, or more, in tall chestnuts or maples.\r\nThe entrance to the nesting cavity often appears nearly, or quite,\r\ncircular, but on careful measurement will usually be shown to be more\r\nor less elliptical, higher than broad; a typical entrance hole that I\r\nmeasured was 1⅞ high by 1½ inches wide. The depth of the cavity was\r\nfound to vary from 10 to 12 inches, but Mr. Shelley (1933) measured\r\none that was 15 inches deep, and even deeper holes have been reported.\r\nOwen Durfee’s notes give some very careful measurements of two of our\r\nlocal nests, one of which is worth quoting as showing an unusually\r\nelliptical entrance: “The entrance to the nest was on the northeast\r\nside of the trunk of a live chestnut and 22½ feet from the ground. The\r\ntree leaned toward the east about 2 feet. At the butt it was 9 inches\r\nin diameter and at the opening about 6½ inches. The opening had the\r\nusual elongated appearance, 2⅝ high by 1⅞ inches wide. The top of the\r\nhole went straight in across the cavity for 4½ inches, the bottom edge\r\nof the opening slanting up ¾ of an inch while going in 1½ inches. Then\r\nthe cavity went nearly straight down below the hole for 12 inches,\r\nenlarging only a trifle, so that the base was about 4½ inches in\r\ndiameter. The shell of the tree was only about ⅞ inch thick on one side\r\nbut on the other was 2 inches thick.”\r\n\r\nDr. Sutton (1928b) says of the nests in Pymatuning Swamp, Pa.: “The\r\ncavities were drilled near the tops of dead trees which nearly always\r\nstood in water. It was impossible to climb many of them because their\r\nbases were weak; but the clamoring of the young birds could be heard\r\nsome distance away. On May 30, 1922, I located six nests within a half\r\nhour by watching the parent birds and listening for the young. * * *\r\nThe twenty-six nests averaged roughly over thirty feet from the ground.”\r\n\r\nT. E. McMullen mentions in his notes a Pennsylvania nest that was 50\r\nfeet from the ground in a large maple in some woods. J. Claire Wood\r\n(1905) reports some very high nests in Michigan; one was in the “trunk\r\nof very large barkless dead elm about 50 feet above ground”; another\r\nwas in the trunk of a “dead beech 55 feet up and just under a large\r\nlimb.”\r\n\r\nThe female probably selects the nesting site, but both sexes work\r\nalternately at the labor of excavating the cavity. This work requires\r\none to three weeks, depending on how hard the wood is; a cavity in the\r\nsoft wood of a poplar, which is a favorite with this species in some\r\nlocalities, might be excavated in a very short time, but I have known a\r\npair to take over three weeks to excavate a nest in a hard maple; the\r\ntrunk of a living tree may have a soft center, and some of the birds\r\nseem to be clever enough to select such a tree. A new nest may often\r\nbe recognized by the presence of fresh chips on the ground around the\r\ntree, as the birds are not very particular about removing them.\r\n\r\nThe male sometimes digs out another shallower hole near the nesting\r\ntree, which he uses as a sleeping place. Usually a fresh hole is\r\nmade each season, but I have seen occupied holes that were very much\r\nweathered, as if they had been occupied for more than one season; in\r\nsuch cases, the cavity may be deepened somewhat and the bottom covered\r\nwith fresh chips. I once found a pair of these woodpeckers excavating\r\ntheir domicile, which they later abandoned, as I found on a later visit\r\nthat the hole was partly full of water and sap. They are not always\r\nsuccessful in their first attempt, for this and other reasons, and may\r\nhave to start two or three holes before they find just the conditions\r\nthey want. The eggs are laid on a soft bed of fresh chips at the bottom\r\nof the cavity and are usually half buried in it; no nesting material is\r\ncarried in.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The hairy woodpecker lays three to six eggs, but four seems\r\nto be the commonest number. The eggs vary in shape from oval to\r\nelliptical-oval, usually more nearly oval. The shell is smooth and\r\noften quite glossy. The color is pure white, but in fresh eggs the\r\nyolk shows through the translucent shell, giving the egg a beautiful\r\norange-pink color. The measurements of 47 eggs average 23.81 by 18.04\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =29.50= by\r\n18.80, 28.70 by =18.90=, and =20.57= by =16.26= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Only one brood is raised in a season, but, if the nest is\r\nrobbed, the female will lay a second set after an interval of 12 or 14\r\ndays, and sometimes even a third set; often subsequent layings may be\r\nin the same nest hole.\r\n\r\nBendire (1895) says:\r\n\r\n     The duties of incubation are divided between the sexes\r\n     and last about two weeks. The young when first hatched\r\n     are repulsive-looking creatures, blind and naked, with\r\n     enormously large heads, and ugly protuberances at the base\r\n     of the bill, resembling a reptile more than a bird. They\r\n     are totally helpless for some days, and can not stand;\r\n     but they soon learn to climb. They are fed by the parents\r\n     by regurgitation of their food, which is the usual way in\r\n     which the young of most Woodpeckers are fed when first\r\n     hatched. * * * The young remain in the nest about three\r\n     weeks. When disturbed they utter a low, purring noise,\r\n     which reminds me somewhat of that made by bees when\r\n     swarming, and when a little older they utter a soft “puirr,\r\n     puirr.” Even after leaving the nest they are assiduously\r\n     cared for by both parents for several weeks, until able to\r\n     provide for themselves.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The young hairy, like all other young woodpeckers, is\r\nhatched naked, and the juvenal plumage is assumed while in the nest, so\r\nthat when the young birds emerge they are fully fledged. In the juvenal\r\nplumage the sexes are sometimes much alike, though oftener there is\r\na decided difference. In both sexes the bill is decidedly smaller,\r\nweaker, and more pointed than in the adult; the color pattern is almost\r\nexactly like that of the adult, but the plumage is softer and fluffier;\r\nthe white markings are more or less tinged with yellowish, the two\r\ninner primaries are dwarfed, and the innermost white tail feather is\r\nusually tipped with black. The colored markings in the crowns of both\r\nsexes are very variable in color and in extent. L. L. Snyder (1923)\r\nhas made a careful study of the crown markings of young hairy and\r\ndowny woodpeckers of both sexes. He found that 90 percent of the young\r\nmale hairies had more or less red, pinkish, or yellowish markings in\r\nthe crowns, and only about 14 percent of the young females were so\r\nmarked. But only 10 percent of the young males and about 43 percent of\r\nthe young females had white markings only on a black crown; and about\r\n43 percent of the young females had the entire crown black. There is\r\ngreat individual variation in the amount and in the distribution of\r\nthese colors; the white spots are often mixed with the other colors;\r\nthe reddish and yellowish colors may invade nearly the whole crown,\r\nexist in one or two large patches, or appear on only a few scattered\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal plumage is worn but a short time; the molt into the first\r\nwinter plumage is accomplished between July and October. This first\r\nwinter plumage is much like that of the adult in both sexes, but the\r\nwhite spots are not quite so pure white, and the red nuchal patch\r\nof the male is duller and often interrupted. Adults have a complete\r\npostnuptial molt in August and September and perhaps a partial\r\nprenuptial molt in spring.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Various studies of the food habits of the hairy woodpeckers\r\nshow that these birds are among our most useful birds and especially\r\nvaluable as protectors of our forest and shade trees and orchards.\r\nMore than 75 percent of their food consists of injurious insects,\r\nwhile the amount of useful insects and cultivated fruits that they\r\ndestroy is insignificant. Prof. F. E. L. Beal (1911) has published\r\nthe most exhaustive report on this subject, based on the study of 382\r\nstomachs collected during every month in the year and from many parts\r\nof the range of the species, including practically all of the races.\r\nHe says: “In the first analysis the food divides into 77.67 percent\r\nof animal matter and 22.33 of vegetable. The animal food consists of\r\ninsects, with a few spiders and millepeds; the vegetable part is made\r\nup of fruit, seeds, and a number of miscellaneous substances.” Of the\r\nanimal food, he says: “The largest item in the annual diet of the hairy\r\nwoodpecker consists of the larvae of cerambycid and buprestid beetles,\r\nwith a few lucanids and perhaps some other wood borers. These insects\r\nconstitute over 31 percent of the food and are eaten in every month\r\nof the year. * * * One stomach contained 100 of these larvae and 83\r\nand 50, respectively, were taken from two others. Of the 382 stomachs,\r\n204, or 53 percent, contained these grubs, and 27 of them held no other\r\nfood. Other beetles amount to a little more than 9 percent.”\r\n\r\nAnts rank second in importance, amounting to a little more than 17\r\npercent, and are taken every month in the year; other Hymenoptera are\r\neaten in very small quantities and irregularly. Caterpillars are the\r\nnext most important item, many of them wood-boring species, amounting\r\nto a little less than 10 percent. “Prof. F. M. Webster states that\r\nhe has seen a hairy woodpecker successfully peck a hole through the\r\nparchment-like covering of the cocoon of a Cecropia moth and devour\r\nthe contents. On examining more than 20 cocoons in a grove of box\r\nelders, he found only 2 uninjured,” according to Professor Beal (1911),\r\nwho adds that bugs (Hemiptera) and plant lice (aphids) form only a\r\nsmall part of the food, and says: “Orthoptera, that is, grasshoppers,\r\ncrickets, and cockroaches, are rarely eaten by the hairy. A few\r\neggs, probably those of tree crickets, and the egg cases (oötheca)\r\nof cockroaches, constitute the bulk of this food. These with a few\r\nmiscellaneous insects amount to a little more than 2 percent for the\r\nyear. Spiders with their cocoons of eggs, including one jointed spider\r\n(Solpugidae), and a few millepeds, were eaten to the extent of about\r\n3.5 percent, which completes the quota of animal food.”\r\n\r\nHe says further:\r\n\r\n     The vegetable food of the hairy woodpecker may be\r\n     considered under four heads: Fruit, grain, seeds, and\r\n     miscellaneous vegetable substances. Fruit amounts to 5.22\r\n     percent of the food, and was contained in 54 stomachs, of\r\n     which 13 held what was diagnosed as domestic varieties,\r\n     and 41 contained wild species. Rubus seeds (blackberries\r\n     or raspberries) were identified in 4 stomachs, and were\r\n     counted as domestic fruit, but it is perhaps more probable\r\n     that they were wild. * * * Of wild fruit 18 species were\r\n     identified. It constitutes the great bulk of the fruit\r\n     eaten, and is nearly all of varieties not useful to man.\r\n\r\n     Corn was the only grain discovered in the food. It was\r\n     found in 10 stomachs, and amounted to 1.37 percent. * * *\r\n     The seed of poison ivy and poison sumac (_Rhus radicans_\r\n     and _R. vernix_) were found in 17 stomachs, and as they\r\n     usually pass through the alimentary canal uninjured,\r\n     the birds do some harm by scattering the seeds of these\r\n     noxious plants. * * * Cambium, or the inner bark of trees,\r\n     was identified in 23 stomachs. Evidently the hairy does\r\n     but little damage by denuding trees of their bark. Mast,\r\n     made up of acorns, hazelnuts, and beechnuts, was found in\r\n     50 stomachs. It was mostly taken in the fall and winter\r\n     months, and appears to be quite a favorite food during the\r\n     cooler part of the year.\r\n\r\nIllustrating the quantities of insects eaten by individual birds, F.\r\nH. King (1883), Wisconsin, writes: “Of twenty-one specimens examined,\r\neleven had eaten fifty-two wood-boring larvae; five, thirteen geometrid\r\ncaterpillars; ten, one hundred and five ants; six, ten beetles; two,\r\ntwo cockroaches; two, nine oötheca of cockroaches; two, two moths;\r\none, a small snail; one, green corn; one, a wild cherry; and one, red\r\nelder berries. * * * One of the above birds had in its stomach eleven\r\nwood-boring larvae (Lamides?) and twelve geometers; another, thirteen\r\nlarvae of long-horn beetles and four cockroach oötheca; another, nine\r\nwood-boring larvae; and two others together had three wood-boring\r\nlarvae, and nine larvae not coleopterous.”\r\n\r\nV. A. Alderson (1890) published the following interesting note: “Last\r\nsummer, potato bugs covered every patch of potatoes in Marathon County,\r\n(being my home county,) Wis. One of my friends here, found his patch an\r\nexception, and therefore took pains to find the reason, and observed a\r\nhairy woodpecker, making frequent visits to the potato field and going\r\nfrom there to a large pine stub a little distance away.\r\n\r\n“After observing this for about six weeks, he made a visit to the pine\r\nstub and found, on inspection, a large hole in its side about fifteen\r\nfeet up. He took his axe and cut down the stub, split it open, and\r\nfound inside, over two bushels of bugs. All had their heads off and\r\nbodies intact.”\r\n\r\nThe woodpecker’s method of locating tree-boring larvae and its\r\nspecialized apparatus for extracting them are so well described by Dr.\r\nThomas S. Roberts (1932) that I cannot do better than to quote him, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     The hairy woodpecker possesses in its tongue one of the\r\n     most remarkably developed and perfectly adapted instruments\r\n     for extracting the tree larvae from their tunnels. The\r\n     tip is a rigid, barbed spear and can be thrust out to\r\n     an astonishing distance by reason of greatly elongated,\r\n     posterior horns which pass up over the back and top of\r\n     the head and run together down in front of the right\r\n     eye, around which they are coiled for almost the entire\r\n     circumference of the socket! So that, the drilling into\r\n     the tunnel accomplished, the tongue darts out, the inner\r\n     ends uncoil, the spear transfixes the grub, and with little\r\n     ado the larva is dragged from its retreat into the bill of\r\n     the bird, pounded perhaps for a moment or two, swallowed\r\n     forthwith or carried to the young, and this most perfectly\r\n     contrived and highly efficient engine is once more ready\r\n     for action. There has been considerable discussion as to\r\n     how the woodpeckers locate the larvae, active or dormant,\r\n     which are hidden deeply in the wood and for which they\r\n     drill so unerringly. All the special senses of birds are\r\n     very highly developed, and it seems probable that in this\r\n     case hearing, touch, and smell all may play a part. The\r\n     active grub, as it crunches the wood, makes a sound that\r\n     would surely be audible to a bird with its keen sense of\r\n     hearing. The tunnel produces a cavity which would give both\r\n     a different sound and feeling on tapping over it. Such\r\n     things as grubs have a strong odor, and it is probable that\r\n     this plays a part also.\r\n\r\nForbush (1927) says: “Maurice Thompson asserts that the hairy\r\nwoodpecker strikes its bill into the wood and then holds the point of\r\none mandible for a moment in the dent thus made. He believes that the\r\nvibrations produced by the insect in the wood are then conveyed through\r\nthe beak and skull of the bird to its brain.”\r\n\r\nIn winter this woodpecker comes readily to suet or meat bones hung up\r\non our trees or feeding stations to attract birds. It is also said\r\nto feed on the carcasses of animals left in the woods by trappers or\r\nhunters and to pick the fat from fresh skins that the trapper has hung\r\nup to dry. Although often called a sapsucker, there is practically no\r\nevidence that it ever does any injury to trees in this way; any sap or\r\ncambium eaten is probably taken incidentally in its search for insects.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The hairy woodpecker is a much shier, more retiring bird\r\nthan the confiding little downy; it is also more active and noisier; it\r\nusually will not allow such close approach but will dodge around the\r\ntrunk of a tree or fly away, if an intruder comes too near, bounding\r\nthrough the air in a series of graceful dips and rebounds. Rex Brasher\r\n(1926) followed one for four hours that alighted “on two hundred and\r\neighteen different trees, an average of nearly one a minute! The\r\nlongest time he remained on one tree was seven minutes. This was a\r\ndead chestnut with most of the bark still adhering. By far the larger\r\nproportion of the trees were old chestnuts, and under their loosely\r\nattached covering he found most successful hunting. Rough-bark species\r\nwere preferred--chestnuts, oaks, old maples and hickories, about in the\r\norder named. Smooth-barked ones received little notice.”\r\n\r\nDr. Morris Gibbs (1902) says: “Have my readers carefully watched a\r\nWoodpecker leave its perch on the trunk or limb? The bird throws itself\r\nbackward from its vertical position by a leg spring, together with a\r\ntail movement, turns in the air in the fraction of a second and is\r\nsweeping away to the next perch. Arriving at the next resting place it\r\nmakes a single counteracting stroke of the wings against the air, and\r\nperches lightly on the bark of limb or trunk.”\r\n\r\nLike all woodpeckers, the hairy is an expert climber, perfectly at home\r\non the trunk of a tree, or even on the under side of a branch, where\r\nits strong claws enable it to cling in almost any position or to move\r\nabout with astonishing rapidity and skill in any direction. Its stiff\r\ntail feathers act as a prop and help to support it while hammering away\r\nat the bark with its powerful beak. Forbush (1927) says that it “is the\r\nembodiment of sturdy energy and persistent industry. Active, cheerful,\r\never busy, its life of arduous toil brings but one reward, a liberal\r\nsustenance. It sometimes spends nearly an hour of hard labor in digging\r\nout a single borer, but commonly reaches the object of its quest in\r\nmuch less time.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The ordinary call of the hairy woodpecker is louder and\r\nshriller than that of the downy. Francis H. Allen says, in his\r\nnotes, that it bears “about the same relation to it as the solitary\r\nsandpiper’s _peet-weet_ does to that of the spotted sandpiper. I hear\r\nit most frequently from the female. In fact, a female of the species\r\nthat visits my place at all times of the year often utters this note\r\ncontinually, as if calling for a mate or claiming territory, but she\r\nnever nests very near.”\r\n\r\nBendire (1895) describes its ordinary note as “a shrill, rattling note,\r\n_triii, triii_;” and again as several loud notes uttered on the wing,\r\nlike _huip, huip_. Forbush (1927) calls the ordinary note “a high,\r\nsharp, rather metallic _chink_ or _click_.” Aretas A. Saunders (1929)\r\nsays: “The call is a loud ‘keep,’ like that of the downy woodpecker,\r\nbut louder. Another call is a loud rattle, suggesting that of the\r\nKingfisher, but slurring down the scale. Another call, ‘kuweek kuweek\r\nkuweek kuweek,’ is used during the mating season, and suggests the\r\nFlicker’s ‘oweeka.’”\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The hairy woodpecker is a large edition of the downy\r\nwoodpecker, a black and white woodpecker, white below and black above,\r\nspotted with white on the wings, and with a broad white stripe down the\r\ncenter of the back. Only the male has the red patch on the back of the\r\nneck. It can be distinguished from the downy by its much larger size,\r\nits more restless behavior, its relatively longer and larger bill, and\r\nby the lateral tail feathers, which are pure white in the hairy and\r\nsomewhat barred with black in the downy.\r\n\r\n_Enemies._--B. T. Gault, in his notes from Marshall County, Ill.,\r\nstates: “The hairy woodpecker is now a very rare breeder here owing to\r\nthe fact that the English sparrow appropriates almost every nest hole\r\nas soon as it is excavated. I once saw one of these sparrows enter the\r\nhole of one of these birds, take a newly hatched bird out in its bill,\r\nflutter for an instant over the water (the nest was in a dead willow\r\nsnag standing in the overflowed Illinois River bottoms), and drop the\r\nyoung bird into the water to drown. It then returned into the nest and\r\nsoon appeared with another newly hatched woodpecker in its bill. As it\r\nfluttered over the water for an instant, my gun cracked and the sparrow\r\ndied.”\r\n\r\nVerdi Burtch (1923) writes: “April 16, 1922, when in a thin wood I\r\nheard a female hairy woodpecker making a great fuss as they do when one\r\ninvades the vicinity of their nest. As I neared the place I saw the\r\nnest hole about twenty feet up in an elm stub. About ten feet away,\r\nsitting erect on a limb of another tree, was a red squirrel eating\r\nsomething that it held in its fore-paws. My 8-power binoculars showed\r\nthis to be a naked baby bird, presumably a hairy woodpecker and not\r\nmore than two or three days old.”\r\n\r\nMr. Shelley (1933) tells of a pair of hairy woodpeckers that were\r\ntwice, in the same season, driven out of their nest by starlings and\r\ntheir eggs destroyed.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--The Hairy woodpecker has often been said to be a permanent\r\nresident on its breeding grounds, but this is not strictly true. The\r\nspecies may be present all through the year over much of its range, but\r\nthere is evidence to indicate a general southward movement in fall; the\r\nindividuals seen in winter are probably not the same as those seen in\r\nsummer. Moreover, there is a noticeable increase in numbers in certain\r\nlocalities in winter.\r\n\r\nLewis O. Shelley has sent me some full notes on the migration of hairy\r\nwoodpeckers, as he has observed it near East Westmoreland, N. H., from\r\nwhich I quote as follows: “For four years I have watched, in the autumn\r\nmonths, passing hairies that go through, some dropping down into the\r\nvalley to feed as they go along, but others passing over the valley\r\nfrom hill to hill (2 miles) without stopping. In passing through,\r\nthey traverse in general the same route each year. They come from an\r\neastern and continue on in a western direction at an oblique angle\r\nto the Connecticut River, which they must cross in the vicinity of\r\nBrattleboro, Vt.\r\n\r\n“These migrants usually appear here late in August or early in\r\nSeptember and continue to arrive at irregular intervals until late in\r\nOctober. It is common for one, or two, rarely more, to pass together;\r\nbut such occurrences have happened, as on October 24, 1934, when,\r\nbeginning soon after noon and lasting until four o’clock, the birds\r\ncontinued to pass through. At least 12 were seen as I walked up a\r\nroadway parallel to their course; and other moving birds were heard. It\r\nwas also noticed that they kept spaced 40 to 50 yards apart, keeping\r\nabreast of one another, traversing in a leisurely manner; and as they\r\napproached a rock maple woods, the tendency was to close in like\r\npassing through the neck of a bottle and, once through the woods, again\r\nto spread out. Their progress was rather fast; and they fed little,\r\nif at all. They often called, as though to locate each other, since\r\nthey were keeping about 40 yards apart, as was easily noted when they\r\ncrossed pasture and mowing land.\r\n\r\n“I followed and watched in particular a male that continued keeping\r\nalong ahead of me. He repeatedly crossed the road in a zigzag manner.\r\nClimbing to the top of a fence post or stump, he made lengthy\r\nobservations, probably noting the progress of the other birds, and\r\noften answered their ringing calls. He, as well as the others, gave the\r\nappearance of a stranger in a new environment, truly a migrant. I noted\r\nhow low the birds were passing, quite frequently flying not over 2 feet\r\nfrom the ground over open spaces, where long, bounding flights were\r\nmade.”\r\n\r\nL. McI. Terrill told Mr. Forbush (1927) that the few local breeding\r\nbirds disappear from the vicinity of Montreal early in autumn, and\r\nothers, in a very noticeable wave, appear toward the end of October or\r\nearly in November.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Aside from the regular migratory movements, the hairy\r\nwoodpecker is much more given to wandering about in winter. It is apt\r\nto forsake its woodland haunts and travel about in search of food,\r\ncoming frequently into the farmer’s orchard, into rural villages, and\r\neven into thickly settled communities in some of our larger cities.\r\nHere it often joins the merry parties at our winter feeding stations,\r\nfeeding readily on the suet or scraps of meat provided for our\r\ninsect-eating birds; and here the smaller birds show due respect for\r\nits larger size, or perhaps for its formidable beak, and it is usually\r\nallowed to eat alone. It seems to be a solitary bird at this season,\r\nfor we seldom see more than one at a time. I find it not so constant\r\nand regular a visitor to my feeding station as the downy woodpecker and\r\nsome other birds; it probably wanders about more.\r\n\r\nMr. Forbush (1927) writes: “During the inclement season it is said\r\nto require a sheltered place in which to sleep and, like the downy\r\nwoodpecker, to excavate a hole in a tree for a sleeping chamber, but\r\nthere is evidence that it does not always seek such shelter, as the\r\nlate Charles E. Bailey and myself watched one for several winter\r\nevenings in a grove, clinging upright against a tree trunk in the usual\r\nwoodpecker position. Night after night, the bird was there at dusk,\r\nremained there until dark, and was there also at daybreak each morning\r\nin precisely the same place.”\r\n\r\nJoseph J. Hickey tells me that, around the lower Hudson River Valley\r\nin winter, woodpeckers obtain much of their food by deliberately\r\nscaling the bark off trees in search for their insect food. The Arctic\r\nthree-toed woodpeckers work mainly on pines and hemlocks, but the\r\nhairies appear to confine their work to the hemlocks, using the same\r\nmethods as the three-toed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Northern and Central America; not regularly migratory.\r\n\r\nThe range of the hairy woodpecker extends =north= to Alaska (Kenai\r\nPeninsula, Fairbanks, and Fort Egbert); Yukon (Forty Mile, Fort\r\nReliance, and Macmillan River); Mackenzie (Fort Wrigley, Lake Hardisty,\r\nand Fort Resolution); northern Saskatchewan (mouth of the Charlot River\r\nand Poplar Point); northern Manitoba (Grand Rapids, probably Fort\r\nChurchill, and probably York Factory); Ontario (Hat Island and Cobalt);\r\nQuebec (Blue Sea Lake, Quebec City, Godbout, Eskimo Bay, and Anticosti\r\nIsland); and Newfoundland (Nicholsville and Raleigh). From this point\r\nthe range extends =southward= along the Atlantic coast to southern\r\nFlorida (Eau Gallie); the western Bahama Islands (Great Bahama, Abaco,\r\nand Andros); and Panama (Boquete). The =southern= boundary of the range\r\nextends westward from Panama (Boquete); Nicaragua (San Rafael); western\r\nGuatemala (Tecpam); Chiapas (San Cristobal); to Guerrero (Chilpancingo\r\nand Omilteme). From this point, =northward= through the mountains of\r\nwestern Mexico, northern Baja California (Sierra San Pedro Martir\r\nand Sierra Juarez); and the coastal districts of California, Oregon,\r\nWashington, and British Columbia, to Alaska (Chilkoot, Chitina Moraine,\r\nand the Kenai Peninsula).\r\n\r\nAs outlined, the range is for the entire species, which has, however,\r\nbeen so divided that no less than 13 subspecies are currently\r\nrecognized as occupying the range north of Mexico, while still others\r\noccur in Central American countries. The typical eastern hairy\r\nwoodpecker (_D. v. villosus_), occurs in the Eastern United States\r\nand southern Canada west to Manitoba, North Dakota, and Colorado\r\nand south to North Caralina and central Texas. The northern hairy\r\nwoodpecker (_D. v. septentrionalis_) occupies the zone to the north,\r\nfrom southeastern Quebec, northwestward to western Mackenzie, Yukon,\r\nand central Alaska. The Newfoundland woodpecker (_D. v. terraenovae_)\r\nis found only on the island of that name. The southern hairy woodpecker\r\n(_D. v. auduboni_) occupies the southeastern part of the range from\r\nMissouri, Illinois, and western Virginia south to southeastern Texas\r\nand southern Florida. The Sitka hairy woodpecker (_D. v. sitkensis_) is\r\nfound in southeastern Alaska and northern British Columbia. The Queen\r\nCharlotte woodpecker (_D. v. picoideus_) is found only on the group\r\nof islands of that name off the coast of British Columbia. Harris’s\r\nwoodpecker (_D. v. harrisi_) occupies the coastal regions of southern\r\nBritish Columbia south to northwestern California. Cabanis’s woodpecker\r\n(_D. v. hyloscopus_) is confined to certain coastal and mountain areas\r\nof California, chiefly in the southern part. The Lower California hairy\r\nwoodpecker (_D. v. scrippsae_) is restricted to the Sierra Juarez and\r\nthe Sierra San Pedro Martir of Baja California. The Modoc woodpecker\r\n(_D. v. orius_) is found in the Sierra Nevada of central California\r\nnorth to Oregon and Washington and east to Nevada. The Rocky Mountain\r\nhairy woodpecker (_D. v. monticola_) is found through the Rocky\r\nMountain region from central British Columbia south to northern New\r\nMexico and east (in winter) to western South Dakota and Nebraska. The\r\nwhite-breasted woodpecker (_D. v. leucothorectis_) is found chiefly\r\nin Arizona and New Mexico but also east to central Texas and north\r\nto southern Utah. The Chihuahua woodpecker (_D. v. icastus_) occurs\r\nprincipally in western Mexico but occurs also in southern Arizona and\r\nsouthwestern New Mexico.\r\n\r\n_Migration._--As stated above, the hairy woodpeckers are generally\r\nnonmigratory and may be found in midwinter even in the northern parts\r\nof their range, as Alaska, Mackenzie (Fort Simpson), and Manitoba\r\n(Aweme, Minnedosa, and Roseau River). Nevertheless, some individuals\r\nare given to a certain amount of wandering during the winter months,\r\nwhich explains the occasional records of some subspecies far outside\r\nof their normal range. There also is more or less vertical migration\r\nin the mountainous regions of the north and west, the birds descending\r\ninto the lower valleys during the winter season. This is noted\r\nparticularly in the Rocky Mountain form, which in winter has been taken\r\neast to Nebraska and South Dakota.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that during the past 18 years several hundred\r\nindividuals of this species have been marked with numbered bands, and\r\nmany have been subsequently recaptured, there is no evidence that any\r\nof these moved at any time more than a few miles from the point of\r\nbanding.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--British Columbia: 8 records, April 27 to June 24.\r\n  California: 43 records, March 23 to June 21; 22 records, April 28\r\n    to May 29, indicating the height of the season.\r\n  Colorado: 10 records, May 5 to June 18.\r\n  Florida: 18 records, April 10 to May 16; 9 records, April 22 to 28.\r\n  Illinois: 8 records, May 1 to 23.\r\n  Iowa: 8 records, April 21 to May 15.\r\n  Labrador: 5 records, May 26 to 30.\r\n  Massachusetts: 17 records, May 1 to June 5; 9 records, May 10 to 19.\r\n  Ontario: 8 records, May 6 to June 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             DRYOBATES VILLOSUS SEPTENTRIONALIS (Nuttall)\r\n\r\n                       NORTHERN HAIRY WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 HABITS\r\n\r\nThis large northern race of the hairy woodpecker inhabits the Canadian\r\nZone of northern North America, north almost to the limit of trees,\r\nfrom central Alaska and northern Canada southward. In the eastern\r\nportions of southern Canada it intergrades with typical _villosus_, and\r\nin northwestern Montana with _monticola_, where the ranges of these\r\nraces meet. Specimens have been taken as far north as Fort Simpson, on\r\nthe Mackenzie River, in latitude 62° N., and at Fort Reliance, on the\r\nupper Yukon River, Alaska, in about latitude 66° N. It may occur as\r\na straggler farther north, where it can find sufficient tree growth,\r\nbut it is said to be rare north of latitude 56° N., and apparently\r\nit does not reach the Arctic coast or the coast of Bering Sea. It is\r\na decidedly larger bird than typical _villosus_, the white markings\r\naverage rather larger, and the white is purer. In the southern portion\r\nof its range, where it begins to intergrade with _villosus_, these\r\ncharacters are, of course, less pronounced and many individuals are\r\ndifficult to name.\r\n\r\nLiving in a region over much of which coniferous forests predominate,\r\nthis woodpecker frequents and breeds in this type of forest. Winton and\r\nDonald Weydemeyer (1928) say that it is an abundant permanent resident\r\nin Lincoln County, Mont., where it intergrades with _monticola_. They\r\nalso say:\r\n\r\n     In the valleys it is most numerous, during summer,\r\n     in forests containing a large percentage stand of\r\n     western larch (_Larix occidentalis_). The next trees\r\n     in attractiveness seem to be Douglas fir (_Pseudotsuga\r\n     taxifolia_), western yellow pine (_Pinus ponderosa_), and\r\n     Engelmann spruce (_Picea engelmanni_), in the order named.\r\n     In the Hudsonian zone it frequents trees of white-bark pine\r\n     (_Pinus albicaulis_) and alpine larch (_Larix lyallii_).\r\n     The species is noticeably rare or absent in forests\r\n     containing nearly pure stands of western white pine (_Pinus\r\n     monticola_), arborvitae (_Thuja plicata_), or lodgepole\r\n     pine (_Pinus contorta_), except where the woods have been\r\n     logged or injured by fire.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The same observers say: “In Lincoln County this species\r\nuses a wide variety of nesting sites. Of eight nests included in our\r\nrecords, three were in live aspens; one in a live cottonwood; one in a\r\nlive larch; one in a dead larch, one in a dead Douglas fir; and one in\r\na woodpecker nesting box.”\r\n\r\nErnest Thompson Seton (1890) found a nest in a tall poplar tree about\r\n30 feet from the ground, in Manitoba; the hole was about a foot deep,\r\n3 inches wide inside and 2 inches at the entrance. John Macoun (1909)\r\nquotes Rev. C. J. Young as saying: “Most of the nests I have seen have\r\nbeen in wet places or near water, and almost all were in white ash\r\ntrees, from thirty to fifty feet from the ground. Two nests were in elm\r\ntrees and one in a telegraph pole by the roadside not more than ten\r\nfeet from the ground.”\r\n\r\nRoderick MacFarlane (1908) writes: “On the 6th of May, 1885, Mr. Reid\r\ndiscovered a nest in a hole in a dry standing poplar tree near Fort\r\nProvidence. There were eight eggs therein, and the parent was seen\r\nand shot. * * * At Fort St. James, Stuart’s Lake, on the 25th of May,\r\n1889, a native hunter found a nest holding four fresh eggs in a similar\r\nposition. Both parents in this instance were also observed near by and\r\nshot. On 4th June, in the same locality, an Indian girl brought us\r\nfour eggs. * * * The nest was found in a hole in a dry pine tree, at a\r\nheight of several feet above the ground.”\r\n\r\nHenry Mousley (1916) says that near Hatley, Quebec, “as a rule the nest\r\nhole is somewhat high up but on one occasion I found one which was only\r\nthree feet above the ground in a birch stub, containing four eggs, the\r\nentrance hole being two inches in diameter, extreme depth eleven inches\r\nand average width two and three quarters inches.”\r\n\r\nP. B. Philipp and B. S. Bowdish (1919), referring to northern New\r\nBrunswick, say: “A nest with young was found in a dead maple stub in\r\na burnt barren, on May 29, 1917. On May 30 of the same year another\r\nnest about fifteen feet up in a dead maple stub in a similar situation,\r\ncontained four eggs, very slightly incubated. On June 9, 1917, a third\r\nnest in a cedar telephone pole beside a public road was examined. It\r\nwas at a height of about nine feet; cavity 14½ inches deep; entrance 2⅛\r\ninches in height by 2¼ inches in width. This nest contained four nearly\r\nfresh eggs.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The northern hairy woodpecker lays three to five eggs; the\r\neight eggs mentioned above by MacFarlane may have been the product\r\nof two females or eggs of the boreal flicker; in the latter case the\r\ncollector may have shot the wrong parent. The eggs are like those\r\nof the eastern hairy woodpecker but average slightly larger. The\r\nmeasurements of 41 eggs average 25.39 by 20.10 millimeters; the eggs\r\nshowing the four extremes measure =28.45= by 22.10, 27.43 by =22.35=,\r\nand =21.5= by =16.6= millimeters.\r\n\r\nThe plumage changes, food, behavior, voice, and other habits apparently\r\ndo not differ materially from those of its southern relative. It is\r\nsaid to be a permanent resident throughout its range, but there is\r\nprobably some southward migration or wandering from at least the\r\nnorthern portion of its range and perhaps from the southern parts also.\r\nThat some individuals remain far north in winter is shown by the fact\r\nthat the Fort Simpson specimen was taken on December 29, 1860. The\r\nWeydemeyers (1928) say that during winter, in northwestern Montana,\r\n“this woodpecker is commonly found in mixed broad-leaf and conifer\r\nassociations along streams, but it is most abundant at that season in\r\nthe larch woods of the valleys.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                DRYOBATES VILLOSUS AUDUBONI (Swainson)\r\n\r\n                       SOUTHERN HAIRY WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                                PLATE 5\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nIn the Lower Austral Zone of the South Atlantic and Gulf States we find\r\nthis small race of the hairy woodpecker. In addition to being decidedly\r\nsmaller than its northern relative, the white of the under parts is\r\nless pure, and the white markings of the upper parts are somewhat\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\nArthur H. Howell (1932) says of its haunts in Florida: “The southern\r\nhairy woodpecker, though not particularly shy, prefers the wilder\r\nsections for its home. It occurs in a variety of situations--the open\r\npine forests, oak hammocks, and the hardwoods of the deep river swamps.\r\nThe birds are of a rather solitary disposition, and rarely is more than\r\na single bird or a pair found near together.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Mr. Howell (1932) says that “the nests are located 12 to 45\r\nfeet from the ground in holes excavated in dead oaks or willow stubs,\r\nor in cypresses growing on the edge of a swamp.” S. A. Grimes (1932)\r\nsays: “A nest thirty feet up in a live cypress near Eastport [Florida]\r\nheld three eggs on April 13. Two well feathered young were found in\r\na hole fifteen feet up in a dead sweet gum in southern Duval County\r\non May 13. A nest eight feet up in a pine stub in northern St. Johns\r\nCounty contained three heavily incubated eggs on May 11.”\r\n\r\nArthur T. Wayne (1910) says that in South Carolina “the nest is very\r\nhard to find; indeed I have found but six nests, two which contained\r\neggs, and four which contained young. I have known this species to\r\nexcavate a hole and raise a brood in a limb of a living live oak tree,\r\nbut it generally excavates its hole in a dead tree and at a great\r\nheight. A set of three fresh eggs was taken April 7, 1898, from a hole\r\n40 feet from the ground in a dead pine. This hole was 14 inches deep.\r\nThe young remain in the hole for more than a month after they are\r\nhatched.”\r\n\r\nHarold H. Bailey (1913) says that in Virginia “dead stubs of gum and\r\npoplar treetops seem to be their favorite location for a nesting site,\r\nvarying from 25 to 60 feet up, the cavity from eight to twelve inches\r\ndeep. They are one of our earliest breeding birds, the drilling of the\r\nnesting cavity beginning the last week in March, and by April 10th to\r\n15th finds a full complement or set of eggs, numbering from four to\r\nsix.”\r\n\r\nJ. G. Suthard writes to me of a nest he found near Madisonville, Ky.\r\nThe cavity was “excavated in a dead crab apple stub in open woodland.\r\nOnly the female was observed excavating the hole and caring for the\r\neggs, which proved to be infertile. No male was ever observed near the\r\nnesting stub, though it was carefully observed.” M. G. Vaiden tells me\r\nof a nest 9 feet up in a chinaberry tree in a yard at Rosedale, Miss.,\r\nand another that was 23 feet up in a pecan tree and 3 feet out in a\r\ndead snag.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The southern hairy woodpecker is said to lay three to six\r\neggs. The latter number must be unusual, as the set generally consists\r\nof three or four eggs. The eggs are scarcely distinguishable from\r\nthose of other hairy woodpeckers, though they average somewhat smaller\r\nthan those of the more northern races. The measurements of 42 eggs\r\naverage 21.29 by 18.29 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes\r\nmeasure =26.1= by 19.2, 25.8 by =19.8=, =21= by 19, and 23.8 by =16.6=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Major Bendire (1895) says that this subspecies seems to be\r\nfonder of fruit and berries than are the northern races and that “the\r\nyoung are fed largely on figs.” Audubon (1842) says that in the salt\r\nmarshes about the mouths of the Mississippi “it alights against the\r\nstalks of the largest and tallest reeds, and perforates them as it is\r\nwont to bore into trees. * * * I have often observed it clinging to the\r\nstalks of the sugar-cane, boring them, and apparently greatly enjoying\r\nthe sweet juices of that plant; and when I have seen it, in severe\r\nwinter weather, attempting to bore the dried stalks of maize, I have\r\nthought it expected to find in them something equally pleasing to its\r\ntaste.”\r\n\r\nMilton P. Skinner (1928) says of these birds, in the sandhills of North\r\nCarolina: “In winter the hairy woodpeckers vary their diet of insects\r\nwith various berries and dried wild fruits. They are particularly fond\r\nof the small black berries of the sour gum (_Nyssa sylvatica_). Soon\r\nafter the early frosts the birds flock to these swamp trees and feast\r\nas long as the berries last.”\r\n\r\nThe main food supply of this and other woodpeckers consists of insects\r\nand their larvae, which are obtained by searching in the crevices in\r\nthe bark of whatever trees are available, or drilling into the trunks\r\nand branches to find the grubs. Mr. Skinner (1928) saw one working on\r\n“a charred and dead stub of a shrub oak. Here it worked steadily for\r\nfifteen minutes pulling out small white grubs and borers. It drove its\r\nbill for three or four strokes up under a bit of bark and then pried\r\nthe bark off with its bill as a lever. Then it attacked the semi-rotten\r\nwood so uncovered, directly. It did not seem to work so fast as a downy\r\nwoodpecker, but then it was so busy eating grubs that it did not have\r\nto dig much.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The same observer says:\r\n\r\n     They do not show a preference for any one kind of tree but\r\n     are found on both living and dead shrub oaks, long-leafed\r\n     pines, loblolly pine, sycamore, sour gum and sweet gum.\r\n     They work on both trunks and limbs but usually at low\r\n     heights, from the ground up to twenty feet above. On a\r\n     vertical surface these birds work up, spiraling it and\r\n     tapping it as they go. They move by a series of short\r\n     hops, propping themselves each time with their tails. When\r\n     hopping lightly along a horizontal limb they still use\r\n     their tails as props. Perhaps their most astonishing feat\r\n     is to spiral horizontal limbs, and to cling beneath them\r\n     and hammer them with their backs down. Sometimes they work\r\n     their way up to the very tip of slender shoots.\r\n\r\n     Even in a heavy wind they cling to the violently swaying\r\n     twigs while eating, but they stay only a short time before\r\n     flying to a tree trunk to perch and rest before trying it\r\n     again. * * *\r\n\r\n     The flight of these birds is strong and undulating, with\r\n     fast beating wings, and generally only from one tree to\r\n     the next. Where the trees are not very close together,\r\n     they swoop down to within a few feet of the ground and\r\n     then fly with nearly level flight until they glide up to\r\n     their next stopping place. Where they have to fly out\r\n     across intervening open fields their flight becomes more\r\n     undulatory, at times deeply so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 DRYOBATES VILLOSUS HARRISI (Audubon)\r\n\r\n                          HARRIS’S WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                              PLATES 4, 5\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe range of this well-marked subspecies is now restricted to the humid\r\ncoast belt from southern British Columbia southward to Humboldt County,\r\nCalif. In 1895, Bendire wrote:\r\n\r\n     Until within the last few years all the Hairy Woodpeckers\r\n     from the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains to the\r\n     Pacific coast have been considered as belonging to this\r\n     subspecies. * * *\r\n\r\n     The breeding range of this race, as now considered, is a\r\n     very limited one, and is probably coextensive with its\r\n     geographical distribution. It is apparently confined to\r\n     the immediate vicinity of the coast, and is not found at\r\n     any great distance inland. Among the specimens collected\r\n     by me at Fort Klamath, Oregon (mostly winter birds),\r\n     there are two which might be called intermediates between\r\n     this and the more recently separated _Dryobates villosus\r\n     hyloscopus_, but the majority are clearly referable to\r\n     the latter. In the typical Harris’s woodpecker the under\r\n     parts are much darker, a smoky brown, in fact; it is also\r\n     somewhat larger and very readily distinguishable from\r\n     the much lighter-colored and somewhat smaller Cabanis’s\r\n     woodpecker.\r\n\r\nDawson and Bowles (1909) say: “Doctor Cooper judged the Harris to be\r\nthe most abundant Woodpecker in Western Washington; and this, with\r\nthe possible exception of the Flicker (_Colaptes cafer saturatior_),\r\nis still true. The bird ventures well out upon the eastern slopes of\r\nthe Cascade Mountains, and is found sparingly in the higher mountain\r\nvalleys; but its favorite resorts are burns and the edges of clearings,\r\nrather than the depths of the woods.”\r\n\r\nJohnson A. Neff (1928) quotes Dr. I. N. Gabrielson as saying: “The\r\nHarris woodpecker is found throughout western Oregon from the western\r\nslope of the Cascades to the coast, altho in the Rogue River Valley\r\nsome specimens which are close to ‘orius’ have been taken. I have one\r\nlabeled ‘orius’ by Dr. H. C. Oberholser, also have typical Harris from\r\nthis district, so that this is probably the region of intergradation\r\nbetween these two forms.”\r\n\r\nHarris’s woodpecker, like many other races of the humid Northwest coast\r\nregion, is darkly colored, one of the most easily recognized of all the\r\nhairy woodpeckers. Even in Audubon’s day it was recognized, described,\r\nfigured, and named by him in honor of his friend Edward Harris. Ridgway\r\n(1914) describes it as “similar to _D. v. hyloscopus_, but under parts\r\n(including lateral rectrices) light drab or buffy drab-gray, instead of\r\nwhite or nearly white, the head-stripes and stripe on back also usually\r\nmore or less suffused with the same color, often uniformly light drab;\r\naverage size slightly larger.”\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Theed Pearse (1934) gives us the following interesting\r\ndescription of the courtship display of this woodpecker:\r\n\r\n     There were two males on the limb of a small cedar and my\r\n     attention was first drawn to them by their note, which is\r\n     very similar to the flicker’s “wickety” note but softer,\r\n     and might almost be described as “caressingly soft.” Both\r\n     birds were calling.\r\n\r\n     The displaying bird would draw in its head so that no neck\r\n     was apparent, with beak pointed outwards and upwards and\r\n     would then slowly swing the upper part of the body from\r\n     side to side, thereby bringing into play the red nape\r\n     marking. Once the bird very rapidly lifted its wings into\r\n     an upright position, at other times there was a quivering\r\n     flicking motion of the wings as they lay against the sides.\r\n\r\n     The two birds flew to another branch, settling side by\r\n     side and instantly each froze, the neck drawn in and the\r\n     beak pointed upwards. They were perched sideways on the\r\n     branch and were displaying the white markings in the tail\r\n     which each of them would slightly spread and turn out\r\n     (to one side). The feathers of the back were at the same\r\n     time hunched up as though to show up the white markings\r\n     there also. They did this several times before flying off\r\n     together.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Although this is evidently a common bird within its\r\nrestricted range, surprisingly little has appeared in print regarding\r\nits nesting habits. Authentic eggs seem to be very rare in collections;\r\nmost of the eggs in collections, of which I have the records, that are\r\nlabeled _harrisi_, prove to be referable to one of the neighboring\r\nsubspecies.\r\n\r\nD. E. Brown writes to me:\r\n\r\n     Its nesting cavities may be at any height from 4 feet to\r\n     well over 100 feet from the ground. I found a nest 8 feet\r\n     up in an 8-inch dead fir stub in a dry open locality. The\r\n     female flushed from the nest, and the date was just right\r\n     for fresh eggs, May 6. The cavity was carefully opened. It\r\n     was 16 inches deep and contained a single egg. This egg\r\n     was so fresh and the shell so clear that the yolk could be\r\n     plainly seen. The cavity was carefully repaired with bark\r\n     from the stub, held in place with black thread. Both birds\r\n     were near all this time, complaining loudly. I returned in\r\n     five days. The bark was still in place, but the egg was\r\n     gone. The dust from the decaying stub, where the egg had\r\n     been, was very dry, and I am of the opinion that the parent\r\n     bird had removed the egg.\r\n\r\nG. D. Sprot has sent me a beautiful photograph (pl. 4) of a nesting\r\nsite of this woodpecker in a dead alder stump in a coniferous forest\r\nclearing, near Mill Bay, Vancouver Island, taken May 23, 1928.\r\n\r\nDawson and Bowles (1909) say:\r\n\r\n     The nest of this bird is usually placed well up in a small\r\n     dead fir tree in some burn or slashing on dry ground.\r\n     It is about ten inches deep and has no lining save fine\r\n     chips, among which the crystal white eggs, four or five in\r\n     number, lie partially imbedded. Incubation is begun from\r\n     the last week in April to the last week in May, according\r\n     to altitude, and but one brood is raised in a season.\r\n     These Woodpeckers are exceptionally valiant in defense of\r\n     their young, the male in particular becoming almost beside\r\n     himself with rage at the appearance of an enemy near the\r\n     home nest.\r\n\r\nS. F. Rathbun sends me the following note on a Harris’s woodpecker that\r\nmade an attempt to dig a nesting hole in a small young fir topped about\r\n10 feet up: “The tree had been cut off so that it could be used as one\r\nof the supports of a cross piece to which a swing was attached. The\r\nwoodpecker began to dig a hole in the topped upright, and the owner of\r\nthe place called me up and wanted to know what the bird was and what\r\nit was up to. I told him all about it and suggested that he keep away\r\nfrom the stub. Two weeks later, I asked him how the bird was getting\r\non. He said at first the bird was busy digging away every day, but of\r\nlate seemed to have something the matter with it, for ‘lately every\r\nday it just sat with its head sticking out of the hole and did no work\r\non it.’ I cut a piece from the edge of the entrance and quickly found\r\nout. When the crossbar for the swing had been nailed to the sapling,\r\na 10-inch spike was used to hold it; and this had gone nearly through\r\nthe sapling. The woodpecker ran into this spike, as it was digging the\r\nhole, after progressing 6 inches or so downward. It did not seem able\r\nto go around the spike, although it had enlarged the cavity an inch on\r\neach side of the heavy nail and had cut away the wood for 2 inches or\r\nmore below the spike. But the job proved to be too much for the bird,\r\nand it eventually gave up and disappeared. I told my friend to pull\r\nthe spike and maybe next year the bird would be back. He followed my\r\nsuggestion, and, the following spring, a Harris’s woodpecker showed up,\r\ndug a hole in the stub, and raised its young. This was repeated the\r\nnext spring after, and then no return of the bird. So quite likely it\r\nmay have been the same woodpecker.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Harris’s woodpecker apparently lays four or five eggs,\r\nprobably seldom fewer or more. Bendire (1895) was evidently unable to\r\nlocate any properly identified eggs of this race, and I have not fared\r\nmuch better. The eggs are probably indistinguishable from the eggs of\r\nother hairy woodpeckers of similar size. The measurements of 34 eggs\r\naverage 25.29 by 18.91 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes\r\nmeasure =27.9= by 19.6, 25.46 by =20.32=, =22.86= by 18.29, and 23.5 by\r\n=17.5= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Food._--J. A. Neff (1928) says:\r\n\r\n     A total of 57 stomachs of hairy woodpeckers were taken for\r\n     the present study, over three fourths of them of the Harris\r\n     type. The months were represented by fairly even numbers of\r\n     specimens. Analysis of these stomachs shows a considerable\r\n     variation from the results of Professor Beal’s California\r\n     studies. The total animal food averaged 82.00 percent,\r\n     while vegetable matter made up the other 18.00 percent.\r\n\r\n     The larvae of wood-boring beetles, Cerambycids and\r\n     Buprestids, composed 49.00 percent of the total. This total\r\n     is unexceeded in Federal studies of birds. Since these two\r\n     groups of borers include species doing enormous damage to\r\n     both forest and ornamental trees, as well as to orchards,\r\n     this item of food alone almost settles the question of the\r\n     utility of having woodpeckers. * * *\r\n\r\n     The vegetable food was of little value economically.\r\n     Fruits, of small wild varieties, totaled 6.00 percent, and\r\n     seeds, mostly of coniferous trees, averaged 12.00 percent.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Taylor and Shaw (1927) made the following interesting\r\nobservation:\r\n\r\n     As is well known, western Washington is a region of copious\r\n     rainfall. During the frequent downpours one can not help\r\n     speculating on the manner in which the different birds and\r\n     mammals avoid injury from the damp and chill of the storm.\r\n     The thick foliage of firs and hemlocks is well suited, in\r\n     many instances, to serve as a thatched roof: and in the\r\n     deep woods there are many big branches and large logs under\r\n     which birds--and mammals too--find dry retreats. During\r\n     the heaviest rain of the summer a Harris woodpecker was\r\n     frightened from its shelter beneath a huge log in the heavy\r\n     forest of Tahoma Creek Canyon. Here the bird was keeping\r\n     perfectly dry. One can imagine its displeasure at being\r\n     driven out from its comfortable refuge into the drenching\r\n     rain.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--D. E. Brown says in his notes: “Early in fall Harris’s\r\nwoodpecker very often excavates a cavity that is its winter home. It\r\ncan be found there every night and quite often in the daytime on stormy\r\ndays. It is not always secure in this retreat. Such a cavity was made\r\nin a partly dead stub, about 20 feet high, just back of my house.\r\nFrequent visits were made to find out how much the nest was used. At\r\nfirst the bird, a male, would fly to a nearby tree when I rapped on the\r\nstub, but soon it contented itself with just coming to the opening.\r\nOne time, while I was in plain sight of the stub, a western pileated\r\nwoodpecker alighted at the cavity and proceeded to open it up, which it\r\ndid clear to the bottom in less than three minutes. It had taken the\r\nHarris about a week to dig it out.”\r\n\r\nDawson and Bowles (1909) say: “The Harris woodpecker visits the\r\nwinter troupes only in a patronizing way. He is far too restless and\r\nindependent to be counted a constant member of any little gossip club,\r\nand, except briefly during the mating season and in the family circle,\r\nhe is rarely to be seen in the company of his own kind.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            DRYOBATES VILLOSUS HYLOSCOPUS Cabanis and Heine\r\n\r\n                         CABANIS’S WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe hairy woodpeckers of the coast district of California from\r\nMendocino County southward, the mountains of southern California,\r\nand the southern Sierra Nevada, as far east as White Mountains of\r\nCalifornia, are now known by the above name. This race is somewhat\r\nsmaller than _harrisi_ and decidedly smaller than _orius_, its\r\nneighboring races to the northward; its under parts are much lighter\r\ncolored than in _harrisi_; these parts are described by Ridgway\r\n(1914) as “dull grayish or brownish white or pale drab-grayish or\r\nbuffy grayish.” This and the Sierra woodpecker (_orius_) seem to\r\nform connecting links between the dark-breasted _harrisi_ and the\r\nwhite-breasted Rocky Mountain forms, _monticola_ and _leucothorectis_,\r\nboth of which are decidedly larger also.\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph Grinnell (1908) says of the distribution of this woodpecker\r\nin the San Bernardino Mountains in southern California: “This was the\r\nmost widely distributed species of woodpecker in the region, occurring\r\nthroughout the timbered portions, irrespective of zones. It was common\r\nfrom Santa Ana Cañon to the summit of Sugarloaf, 9,800 feet, and nearly\r\nto timber line on San Gorgonio peak. On the desert side the species was\r\nnoted as low as Cactus Flat, 6,000 feet, where one was seen in some\r\ngolden oaks in a ravine, August 16, 1905.”\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--The drumming of woodpeckers in the spring on some\r\nresonant limb or tree trunk is an important part of the courtship\r\nurge, as a warning to any rival, or as a call to a possible mate. Dr.\r\nGrinnell (1908) shows how the manner of drumming may also serve as\r\na recognition call; he says: “The resonant rattling drum identified\r\nthis species from any other of this region. Near Dry lake, 9,000\r\nfeet altitude, dead tamarack pines were selected for this purpose,\r\nand on June 23, 1905, I listened for many minutes to a remarkable\r\ndemonstration of this kind. Different branches were tattoed in rapid\r\nsuccession, so that a xylophone-like variety of tones was produced,\r\nvery impressive and far-carrying through the otherwise quiet forest.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Major Bendire (1895) writes:\r\n\r\n     In California Cabanis’ Woodpecker is common in the\r\n     mountains, but in the lowlands in the southern part of this\r\n     State Mr. F. Stephens considers it a rather rare summer\r\n     resident. He found it breeding in a cottonwood tree, near\r\n     San Bernardino, on March 21, 1885. Mr. Lyman Belding took\r\n     several nests of this subspecies in Calaveras County, in\r\n     the Sierra Nevadas; in one, found on June 6, 1879, which\r\n     had been excavated in a dead pine stump, 12 feet from the\r\n     ground, the eggs, three in number, were on the point of\r\n     hatching. In his notes he says: “I scared the female from\r\n     it and prevented her return by inserting a stick, the end\r\n     of which protruded for several feet. When she found she\r\n     could not enter she gave several cries, which brought\r\n     the male, who hopped up and down the stick a few times,\r\n     striking it with his bill and screaming angrily, pausing\r\n     occasionally, and apparently deliberating on the best\r\n     method of extracting it.” Another nest, found by him on\r\n     July 10, 1880, was located only 3 feet from the ground, and\r\n     contained young which were still in the nest on the 20th.\r\n     Mr. Charles A. Allen informs me that along the Sacramento\r\n     River, in California, it breeds in sycamores and willows,\r\n     but that it is not common there.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Major Bendire (1895) says:\r\n\r\n     The number of eggs laid to a set varies from three to six;\r\n     those of four are by far the most common; sets of five are\r\n     only occasionally met with, while sets of six are very\r\n     unusual. * * * The eggs lie on the fine chips left in the\r\n     bottom of the cavity, and are occasionally well packed into\r\n     these, so that only about one-half of the egg is visible.\r\n     They resemble the eggs of _Dryobates villosus_ in color,\r\n     but those of an elliptical ovate shape are more common than\r\n     the oval and elliptical ovals, averaging, therefore, more\r\n     in length, while there is proportionally less difference in\r\n     their short diameter.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of 23 eggs average 24.49 by 18.38 millimeters; the\r\neggs showing the four extremes measure =25.7= by 18.2, 24.2 by =19.7=,\r\n=22.8= by 18.1, and 24.9 by =16.5= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Mrs. Irene G. Wheelock (1904) says: “Both sexes share the\r\nlabors of excavating, brooding the eggs, and feeding the young.\r\nIncubation lasts about fifteen days, and the young remain nearly four\r\nweeks in the nest, being fed most of that time by regurgitation. After\r\nleaving they are fed by the parents for at least two weeks, and usually\r\nreturn to the nest at night to sleep.”\r\n\r\n_Food._--W. Leon Dawson (1923) writes: “Nearly half of the Cabanis\r\nWoodpecker’s food consists of the larvae of wood-boring beetles\r\n(the _Cerambycidae_ and _Buprestidae_); and of the remainder the\r\ncaterpillars of various injurious moths form a large per cent. Wild\r\nraspberries and blackberries are eaten in summer, and certain hardy\r\nfruits, such as cornel berries, acorns, and the pits of the islay, or\r\nevergreen cherry (_Prunus ilicifolia_), eke out the winter sustenance.”\r\n\r\nReferring to its manner of feeding, Milton P. Skinner says in his\r\nnotes: “On August 10, 1933, I saw a Cabanis working on both the trunk\r\nand the limbs of a small Douglas fir. It worked all around a horizontal\r\nlimb and really seemed to be under the limb more than above. It also\r\nworked on upright branches as well. I have also seen a Cabanis feeding\r\non the bark of a lodgepole pine. One day I found one on a dead black\r\noak, scaling off dead bark to get at the insects beneath. So far as I\r\ncan tell, these birds, in the Sequoia National Park, seem to prefer to\r\npick food from the surface and furrows in the bark, and do not bore\r\ninto the bark and wood as much as other woodpeckers. During my work\r\namong the Big Trees, I noticed that these birds seem to avoid the\r\nsequoia’s bark; but at one place I found a living tree with many holes\r\nbored in the old wood of its charred base, where it was unprotected by\r\nbark.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Mr. Skinner’s notes say that “this woodpecker has quite a\r\nfew mannerisms of its own. One, seen flying across a meadow, went first\r\nto the limbs of Douglas firs, then to a small dead limb of a sequoia,\r\nthen to the limb of a fir, and then to the trunk of the same fir. It\r\nperched lengthwise of limb and trunk each time. And this procedure was\r\nfollowed again and again on different days. Usually the Cabanis perches\r\ncrosswise on a horizontal limb, especially when resting or preening,\r\nbut lengthwise on erect, or nearly erect, trunks and limbs when feeding.\r\n\r\n“Although this woodpecker almost always flies to the exact spot it\r\nselects, its flight through the forest is undulatory. The undulations\r\nare due to the fact that it progresses by a series of wing beats. At\r\nthe end of each series, it seems to actually close its wings and shoot\r\nforward with the impetus gained.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 DRYOBATES VILLOSUS MONTICOLA Anthony\r\n\r\n                    ROCKY MOUNTAIN HAIRY WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 HABITS\r\n\r\nThis large, white-breasted hairy woodpecker inhabits the Rocky Mountain\r\nregion, in the Canadian and Transition Zones, from central British\r\nColumbia and Montana southward to eastern Utah and northern New Mexico,\r\nand eastward to western South Dakota and western Nebraska. Ridgway\r\n(1914) characterizes it as “similar, in large size and whiteness of\r\nunder parts, to _D. v. septentrionalis_, but with white spots on\r\nwing-coverts much reduced in size or number, or altogether wanting.” It\r\nevidently intergrades with _septentrionalis_ in Montana and Wyoming\r\nand probably with the more western races west of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nMilton P. Skinner tells me that in the Yellowstone National Park it\r\n“occurs at all elevations from the lowest at 5,500 feet to timberline\r\nat 9,500 feet above sea level, but never far from a tree of some kind.\r\nIt is a resident bird here but moves down from the mountain heights at\r\nthe approach of winter.”\r\n\r\nAretas A. Saunders (1921) says of its status in Montana: “A common\r\npermanent resident throughout the western half of the state in the\r\nmountains. Winters mainly in the valleys in cottonwood groves, but does\r\nnot breed there. * * * The eastern limits of its range are evidently\r\nin the eastern foothills of the mountains. Just what form breeds in\r\nthe more eastern mountain ranges is not definitely determined. In the\r\nmountains this bird has been recorded by all observers. It is common\r\neverywhere, and usually the commonest of the mountain woodpeckers.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The following remarks by Major Bendire (1895), under\r\n_hyloscopus_, evidently refer to this subspecies: “Mr. Denis Gale found\r\nit breeding in Boulder County, Colorado, on May 28, 1886, in a live\r\naspen tree, at an altitude of about 8,500 feet. The nest contained five\r\neggs, in which incubation was somewhat advanced. Mr. William G. Smith\r\nalso reports it as common in Colorado, coming down into the valleys in\r\nwinter. He says it is the earliest of the Woodpeckers to breed, that it\r\ncommences nesting in the latter part of April, and usually excavates\r\nits holes in old dead pines, frequently at a considerable distance from\r\nthe ground, and that he has seen full-grown young by June 1.”\r\n\r\nJ. K. Jensen (1923) says of this woodpecker, in northern Santa Fe\r\nCounty, N. Mex.:\r\n\r\n     Quite common in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, from 8,000\r\n     to 11,000 feet. June 21, 1920, I found a nest thirty feet\r\n     up in a large quaking aspen. This tree stands on the edge\r\n     of a place where an avalanche has plowed its way down\r\n     through the timber on the mountain side, depositing trees\r\n     and rocks in a great heap for hundreds of feet around the\r\n     tree. The nest contained young, and judging from the noise\r\n     they made, were quite well developed. The parent birds were\r\n     very noisy.\r\n\r\n     May 22, 1921, I made my way through four feet of snow to\r\n     the same tree. A new nest had been made, and the female\r\n     flew off when I was about 150 feet away. I cut into the\r\n     nest and found a set of four eggs on which incubation had\r\n     just commenced. The altitude at this point is 11,000 feet.\r\n     May 26, 1922, I found a nest with young about seventy-five\r\n     feet up in an aspen. This was in Santa Fe Canyon at an\r\n     altitude of 8,000 feet.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The eggs of the Rocky Mountain hairy woodpecker are similar to\r\nthe eggs of other hairy woodpeckers of similar size. The measurements\r\nof 33 eggs average 24.89 by 18.49 millimeters; the eggs showing the\r\nfour extremes measure =28.08= by 18.03, 27.0 by =20.1=, =23.37= by\r\n17.78, and 24.38 by =17.27= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Mr. Skinner says, in his notes, that this woodpecker “seeks\r\nits food on the trunks of lodgepole and _flexilis_ pines, cedars,\r\nfirs, aspens, willows, and even electric-light and telephone poles; it\r\nprefers dead and diseased trees and stubs to work on, probably because\r\nof more borers and grubs. At Basin, and over 7,000 feet elevation,\r\nI found a female where I could watch her, only 5 feet away from the\r\nlodgepole trunk on which she was working. She worked down, tapping\r\nhere and there as she went. Whenever a tap revealed a borer, she\r\nscaled off the bark with quick right and left strokes, having a slight\r\nlever motion at the end, and always secured from one to six bark-borer\r\ngrubs. Evidently the tap told her whether it was worth while to search\r\nfurther, for she never made a mistake and performed no useless labor.”\r\n\r\nJ. A. Munro (1930) writes: “During the winter of 1928-29 a male hairy\r\nwoodpecker frequently was seen feeding on Virginia creeper berries in\r\ncompetition with several red-shafted flickers. On one occasion the same\r\nbird visited an apple tree, attracted by a few apples that still clung\r\nto the bare branches. Standing crossways on a branch, in the ordinary\r\nposition of a perching bird, he rapidly stabbed his bill downward into\r\nthe top of an apple. After doing this several times he flew to another\r\nportion of the tree and repeated the performance.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  DRYOBATES VILLOSUS PICOIDEUS Osgood\r\n\r\n                      QUEEN CHARLOTTE WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 HABITS\r\n\r\nDr. Wilfred H. Osgood (1901) described the hairy woodpecker of the\r\nQueen Charlotte Islands, as a full species, _Dryobates picoideus_. He\r\nsays it can be distinguished from all other members of the _villosus_\r\ngroup by the black markings on the back and characterizes it as\r\n“similar in general to _Dryobates v. harrisi_; bill slightly smaller;\r\nmiddle of back barred and spotted with black; flanks streaked with\r\nblack.” He says that this woodpecker is not abundant on the islands;\r\nduring a period of over a month spent in active collecting he saw only\r\nsix, all of which were collected.\r\n\r\nI cannot find that anything has been published on the habits of the\r\nQueen Charlotte woodpecker, which probably do not differ essentially\r\nfrom those of _harrisi_, to which it is closely related and which\r\ninhabits a similar, humid coast environment. There are a number of\r\nskins of this race in various collections, but, so far as I know, no\r\nauthentic eggs have ever found their way into any American collection.\r\nVery little exploration has been done in the interior of the Queen\r\nCharlotte Islands, and we know very little about the habits of its\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               DRYOBATES VILLOSUS TERRAENOVAE Batchelder\r\n\r\n                        NEWFOUNDLAND WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 HABITS\r\n\r\nCharles F. Batchelder (1908), who discovered and described this race of\r\nthe hairy woodpecker, characterized it as--\r\n\r\n     Similar to typical _Dryobates villosus_, but slightly\r\n     larger, the black areas of the upper parts increased, the\r\n     white areas reduced both in number and in size, especially\r\n     in the remiges and wing coverts. * * * _Dryobates villosus\r\n     terraenovae_ is much smaller than _D. v. leucomelas_, and\r\n     is, of course, even more remote from it in coloring than\r\n     from true _villosus_. Between it and _D. v. hyloscopus_\r\n     and _D. v. monticola_ there is a striking resemblance in\r\n     coloring, but the wide area--occupied throughout its extent\r\n     either by _villosus_ or by _leucomelas_--that intervenes\r\n     between the ranges of these two Western subspecies and that\r\n     of _terraenovae_, precludes the possibility of immediate\r\n     intergradation, while the utter dissimilarity of the\r\n     climatic conditions of their respective habitats forbids\r\n     the supposition that like causes in environment have\r\n     developed like characters; apparently this is a case where\r\n     superficial resemblances have arisen entirely independently\r\n     of climatic influences.\r\n\r\nI found the Newfoundland woodpecker fairly common in the heavily\r\ntimbered valleys of the Fox Island and Sandy Rivers in Newfoundland\r\nin 1912. The timber in the flat river bottom and on the islands in\r\nthe Fox Island River is almost wholly made up of deciduous trees,\r\nmainly poplar, canoe birch, ash, mountain ash (which grows to a very\r\nlarge size), and alder, mixed with a few spruces. On the surrounding\r\nhillsides the forest growth consists mainly of firs and spruces, with\r\nplenty of canoe and yellow birches, poplars, larches, and mountain\r\nashes. The Sandy River runs through a fairly level and heavily timbered\r\nregion, with forests of large firs, red, white, and black spruces,\r\nmixed with some birches and poplars. These two regions were the only\r\nplaces where we found this and the downy woodpecker, nesting in the\r\ndeciduous trees. It has been observed by others in other places,\r\nand doubtless it occurs wherever there is heavy timber, with a fair\r\nsprinkling of deciduous trees, mainly along the streams and about the\r\nshores of lakes.\r\n\r\nI can find nothing noted on its habits that is in any way different\r\nfrom those of the other eastern races. So far as I know, its eggs have\r\nnever been taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 DRYOBATES VILLOSUS ICASTUS Oberholser\r\n\r\n                         CHIHUAHUA WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                                PLATE 6\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe hairy woodpeckers of the Canadian and Transition Zones in the\r\nmountains of northwestern Mexico, southern Arizona, and southern New\r\nMexico are referable to this race. In describing and naming it, Dr.\r\nH. C. Oberholser (1911a) characterized it as “similar to _Dryobates\r\nvillosus hyloscopus_, but bill much smaller, and wing slightly\r\nlonger. * * * This bird is decidedly smaller than _Dryobates villosus\r\nleucothorectis_, as well as noticeably smoky-tinged on the under\r\nsurface, instead of pure white; and it is in size so very much inferior\r\nto _Dryobates villosus orius_, that it is readily distinguishable.”\r\n\r\nHarry S. Swarth (1904) says of the haunts of this woodpecker in the\r\nHuachuca Mountains, Arizona: “Fairly abundant in the higher parts of\r\nthe mountains, from 7,000 feet upward. They may be seen almost anywhere\r\nin that region, but for breeding purposes, seem to particularly favor\r\nthe dense thickets of quaking asp.” In 1922, Frank C. Willard and I\r\nfound them breeding mainly among the tall pines near the summit of\r\nthese mountains, above 7,500 feet. From here to the summit, about 9,000\r\nfeet, the land is rolling, mostly in gentle slopes, and covered with\r\na fine, open, parklike forest of tall pines of two or three species,\r\nmany of them from 80 to 100 feet high. The many dead, standing trees\r\nand stumps offered suitable nesting sites for pygmy nuthatches, Mexican\r\ncreepers, and Chihuahua woodpeckers. We did not see any of these\r\nwoodpeckers in the spruce and fir belt, below 7,000 feet.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--On May 7, 1922, in the pine region near the summit of the\r\nHuachuca Mountains, described above, we located two pairs of Chihuahua\r\nwoodpeckers and saw some new excavations in the dead pine stubs, in\r\nwhich they seemed to be preparing to nest, but they evidently had not\r\nyet laid their eggs. On May 15 we returned and found two of the nests\r\noccupied (pl. 6). The first nest was about 40 feet from the ground in\r\na dead pine stub at an elevation of about 7,900 feet; the cavity was\r\nabout 15 inches deep and contained four fresh eggs. Farther up, near\r\nthe summit, at about 8,500 feet, we found the second nest; this was\r\nonly about 15 feet up in a large dead pine, in a hole we had previously\r\npassed by as an old one; but we saw the female enter the hole and stay\r\nthere, so we chopped it out and found three heavily incubated eggs in\r\na cavity about 12 inches deep. Frank C. Willard (1918) tells of a\r\npair of these woodpeckers that “had nested for several seasons in the\r\ndead top of a tall pine. One winter, this broke off and lodged in the\r\ntop of an adjoining pine. Even with their nest site in this apparently\r\ninsecure position the woodpeckers were unwilling to leave it, and\r\ntheir new nest was found dug in the same old tree top in its inverted\r\nposition.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The eggs of the Chihuahua woodpecker do not differ materially\r\nfrom those of other hairy woodpeckers of similar size. The measurements\r\nof three eggs in the author’s collection are =24.6= by 17.2, =24.5= by\r\n17.7, and 24.6 by =18.0= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Mr. Swarth (1904) says: “They do not seem to remain through\r\nthe winter months; at any rate I saw none during February, 1903 nor did\r\nany appear until March 17, when I secured two and saw one other. Ten\r\ndays later they were quite abundant. The winter of 1902-1903 was quite\r\ncold, with a great deal of snow on the ground, and it is possible that\r\nwith a milder winter they might remain the year through. There does not\r\nseem to be any vertical migration on the part of this woodpecker, for\r\nI saw none below 7,000 feet, and but very few as low as that.” Bendire\r\n(1895), however, writes: “In southern Arizona it does not appear to\r\nbreed in the lower valleys, but I have shot several near Tucson in\r\nwinter.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  DRYOBATES VILLOSUS SITKENSIS Swarth\r\n\r\n                        SITKA HAIRY WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 HABITS\r\n\r\nIn the coast region of southeastern Alaska and northern British\r\nColumbia we find a race that Harry S. Swarth (1911b) says, in\r\ndescribing and naming it, “differs from _D. v. harrisi_ mainly in the\r\nvery much paler, less smoky hue of the lower parts, and the more buffy\r\ncoloration of the nasal tufts. Somewhat like _D. v. picoideus_, but\r\npaler colored below, and lacking the barred rectrices of that race.” He\r\nsays elsewhere (1922):\r\n\r\n     _Sitkensis_, in its relatively light ventral coloration,\r\n     is intermediate between the extremely dark _harrisi_ and\r\n     the white-breasted _monticola_. The dark-breasted type of\r\n     coloration reaches its extreme development in _picoideus_\r\n     of the Queen Charlotte Islands, interposed between the\r\n     ranges of _harrisi_ and _sitkensis_. Thus, while specimens\r\n     of _sitkensis_ as laid out in trays may be arranged to\r\n     illustrate a step between _harrisi_ and _monticola_, the\r\n     geographical distribution of the several forms is not in\r\n     accordance with this idea. The geographical chains appear\r\n     to lie as follows: Starting with the white-breasted races\r\n     of the interior of the northwest, _septentrionalis_ and\r\n     _monticola_, there is an extension westward on the coast\r\n     of a slightly darker breasted race, _sitkensis_. Starting\r\n     again with the dark breasted type, _harrisi_, of the Puget\r\n     Sound region, and going northward, we reach the extremely\r\n     dark colored _picoideus_. Thus, sitkensis and _harrisi_\r\n     are really far apart genetically, and the appearance of\r\n     _sitkensis_ as a seeming intergrade between _monticola_\r\n     and _harrisi_ must be explained on grounds other than those\r\n     of such actual intermediate relationship. _Sitkensis_, as\r\n     an offshoot of the white-breasted type of the interior,\r\n     may have arrived at the humid coast at too recent date to\r\n     be yet affected by its surroundings to the extent that\r\n     _harrisi_ and _picoideus_ have been; or it may be more\r\n     resistant to such an environment. In either case the slight\r\n     modification of the clear white breast of _monticola_\r\n     produced by the humid surroundings would result in an\r\n     apparent intergrade toward _harrisi_.\r\n\r\nOn the habits of this subspecies, which probably do not differ\r\nmaterially from those of other hairy woodpeckers, I can find only the\r\nfollowing brief comment by Joseph Dixon, quoted by Dr. Joseph Grinnell\r\n(1909): “At the three lakes back of Mole Harbor I saw more of these\r\nbirds than at all other places put together. Their slow drumming\r\nsounded so similar to the clicking of a telegraph instrument that\r\nwe dubbed them ‘telegraph woodpeckers’ to distinguish them from the\r\nsapsuckers.” So far as I know, the nest of this woodpecker has never\r\nbeen reported. It is probably resident throughout its breeding range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  DRYOBATES VILLOSUS ORIUS Oberholser\r\n\r\n                           MODOC WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThis race of the hairy woodpecker occupies a rather extensive range\r\nin the interior of California, Oregon, and Washington, west of the\r\nrange of _monticola_ in the Rocky Mountains, north of the range\r\nof _hyloscopus_ in southern California, and east of the range of\r\n_harrisi_ in the above States. As might be expected, it is more or less\r\nintermediate in size or coloration between the surrounding races. Dr.\r\nH. C. Oberholser (1911a), who described and named it, characterized it\r\nas “resembling _Dryobates villosus leucothorectis_, but larger; lower\r\nparts usually brownish white, instead of pure white.”\r\n\r\nGrinnell and Storer (1924) say of its haunts in the Yosemite region:\r\n“As with most of the allied forms, the present race ranges through\r\nseveral life zones, from the scattered digger pines at Pleasant Valley\r\neastward through the main forest belt to the sparse tracts of Jeffrey\r\npines in the vicinity of Mono Lake. It is nowhere really common, even\r\nfor a woodpecker; it reaches its greatest numbers in the upper part of\r\nthe Transition Zone and in the Canadian Zone.”\r\n\r\nIn the Lassen Peak region, according to Grinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale\r\n(1930), “this woodpecker foraged over the trunks and larger limbs of\r\nmany kinds of trees both in the forests proper and where there were a\r\nfew trees or restricted tracts of trees in the mainly unforested parts\r\nof the section. Much of each bird’s time was spent on coniferous\r\ntrees, either living or dead ones, but nesting excavations were many of\r\nthem in trunks of deciduous trees.”\r\n\r\nBendire (1895) says that, at Fort Klamath, Oreg., “it appears to be\r\nespecially abundant in tracts in which the timber has been killed\r\nby fire, and where many of the slowly rotting trunks still remain\r\nstanding. Such burnings are frequently met with in the mountains, and\r\nseem to attract several species of Woodpeckers, presumably on account\r\nof the abundance of suitable food to be found.”\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Grinnell and Storer (1924) say: “At Chinquapin, on May\r\n19, 1919, a pair of these woodpeckers was seen going through their\r\ncourting antics. A male was in a large yellow pine at the edge of a\r\nlogged-over area, calling almost incessantly. His usual _speenk_ had\r\nbecome _spenk-ter-ter-ter_, a staccato run repeated every few seconds.\r\nThe female answered in like voice but uttered the trill less often. The\r\nmale changed his location many times, and after protracted calling on\r\nhis part, the female flew to the same tree.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Bendire (1895) writes:\r\n\r\n     I took my first nest near Camp Harney, Oregon, on May\r\n     29, 1875, in a canyon on the southern slopes of the Blue\r\n     Mountains, at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. The cavity\r\n     was excavated in the main trunk of a nearly dead aspen,\r\n     about 12 feet from the ground. The entrance hole was about\r\n     1¾ inches in diameter, and the cavity about 9 inches deep.\r\n     It contained four much incubated eggs. The female was in\r\n     the hole, and stayed there looking out until I had struck\r\n     the tree several times with a hatchet, when she flew off\r\n     and alighted on one of the limbs of the tree, uttering\r\n     cries of distress, which brought the male, who was still\r\n     more demonstrative, hopping from limb to limb, squealing\r\n     and scolding at me and pecking at the limbs on which he\r\n     perched. At Fort Klamath, Oregon, it was somewhat more\r\n     common, and here I took several of its nests. * * * Dead or\r\n     badly decayed trees are preferred to live ones for nesting\r\n     purposes, and deciduous trees to conifers; it also nests\r\n     occasionally in firs and madrone trees.\r\n\r\nMilton P. Skinner says, in his notes, that “in the Yosemite National\r\nPark, one nested in a living willow trunk about ten feet above the\r\nground.” Grinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale (1930) say that, in the Lassen\r\nPeak region, “aspens and cottonwoods, dead at core, seemed to be\r\npreferred nesting trees, although other kinds were also used. Nest\r\nholes, when in conifers, were made in dead and decaying trunks or\r\nstubs.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Three or four eggs make up the usual set for this woodpecker.\r\nThey are indistinguishable from the eggs of other hairy woodpeckers,\r\nthough Bendire (1895) says that “those of an elliptical ovate shape are\r\nmore common than the oval and elliptical ovals.” The measurements of\r\n15 eggs average 24.70 by 18.80 millimeters; the eggs showing the four\r\nextremes measure =26.4= by =20.6= and =21.5= by =16.2= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Grinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale (1930) write: “Near Eagle\r\nLake Resort on June 12, 1929, an adult was feeding a nestful of young\r\nwoodpeckers in a cavity three meters up in a yellow-pine stub close to\r\nthe lake. The nest hole had been freshly cut. Only the female was seen\r\nto carry food. The young were large enough to be fed without the parent\r\nentirely entering the cavity. When the observer walked near the nest\r\nstub the parent became much excited and flew about calling loudly for\r\nseveral minutes. The young birds called when the parent came with food.”\r\n\r\n_Food._--Grinnell and Storer (1924) say:\r\n\r\n     The Modoc Woodpecker forages on both evergreen and\r\n     deciduous trees, favoring the latter, perhaps, during\r\n     the winter months. In summer it is usually rather quiet,\r\n     particularly so as compared with the noisy California\r\n     Woodpecker. It gains much of its food in the outer portions\r\n     of the bark, where a few strokes of moderate intensity\r\n     enable it to secure any insect or grub living near the\r\n     surface of the tree.\r\n\r\n     At the margin of the forest above Coulterville, May 31,\r\n     1915, a Modoc Woodpecker was seen foraging in a yellow\r\n     pine. The tree in question had recently been killed by the\r\n     boring beetles which were common in the western forests\r\n     that year. The woodpecker was going over the tree in\r\n     systematic manner, working out and in along one branch,\r\n     then ascending the trunk to the next branch where it would\r\n     repeat the performance. The bird was flaking off the outer\r\n     layers of the bark without much evident expenditure of\r\n     effort, for little noise of tapping was heard; it was\r\n     feeding presumably on the boring beetles or their larvae.\r\n\r\nBendire (1895) writes: “It is one of our most active Woodpeckers,\r\nalways busy searching for food, which consists principally of injurious\r\nlarvæ and eggs of insects, varied occasionally with a diet of small\r\nberries and seeds, and in winter sometimes of piñon nuts, pine seeds,\r\nand acorns. At this season I have often seen this species around\r\nslaughter houses, picking up stray bits of meat or fat, and have also\r\nseen it pecking at haunches of venison hung up in the open air.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Mr. Skinner says, in his notes, that “the Modoc hairy\r\nseems very unsociable. One that was feeding on a cottonwood chased a\r\nvisiting red-breasted sapsucker away from that tree to another, and\r\nthen from tree to tree. But, when a California woodpecker came to its\r\ntree, the Modoc hairy promptly flew away.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Major Bendire (1895) says that this woodpecker “is very\r\nnoisy, especially in the early spring. It likewise is a great drummer,\r\nand utters a variety of notes, some of which sound like ‘kick-kick,\r\nwhitoo, whitoo, whit-whit, wi-wi-wi-wi,’ and a hoarse guttural one,\r\nsomewhat like ‘kheak-kheak’ or ‘khack-khack’.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   DRYOBATES VILLOSUS SCRIPPSAE Huey\r\n\r\n                   LOWER CALIFORNIA HAIRY WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nLaurence M. Huey (1927) who described and named this woodpecker,\r\ncharacterized it as “similar to _Dryobates villosus hyloscopus_ Cabanis\r\nand Heine, but decidedly smaller. In fully adult birds, the dusky white\r\nof the breast extends farther down on the breast than does that on\r\nexamples from the northern mountains.” He gives, as its range, “the\r\npine clad slopes of the Sierra Juarez and Sierra San Pedro Martir,\r\nLower California, Mexico. * * * The range of this southern race does\r\nnot extend north of the International Boundary, as specimens examined\r\nfrom the mountains of San Diego County, California, are in no way\r\ninclined toward the race _D. v. scrippsae_, but are counterparts of\r\ntypical _D. v. hyloscopus_ from the northern localities. In fact, the\r\nonly variation that could point toward a ‘blending’ is found in the\r\nSierra Juarez birds, but their average falls so near that of the birds\r\nfrom the Sierra San Pedro Martir that the name proposed herewith should\r\napply.”\r\n\r\nThis southern race probably does not differ materially in its habits\r\nfrom other hairy woodpeckers, except in so far as it is affected by its\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             DRYOBATES VILLOSUS LEUCOTHORECTIS Oberholser\r\n\r\n                       WHITE-BREASTED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nNorthward and eastward from the range of the Chihuahua woodpecker\r\n(_icastus_) and southward from the range of the Rocky Mountain hairy\r\nwoodpecker (_monticola_) lies the range of this white-breasted race\r\nof the hairy woodpecker, extending from southern Utah, through\r\nArizona and New Mexico, into central western Texas. It is evidently\r\na smaller edition of monticola, for Dr. Harry C. Oberholser (1911a),\r\nin describing and naming it, says that it is “much like _Dryobates\r\nvillosus monticola_, but decidedly smaller; wing coverts practically\r\nalways without white spots.”\r\n\r\nDr. Edgar A. Mearns (1890b) says of its haunts in the mountains of\r\nnorthern Arizona:\r\n\r\n     Breeds commonly throughout the pine belt, often ascending\r\n     higher in summer, then preferring aspens to the fir and\r\n     spruce woods of higher altitudes. It very rarely descends\r\n     to the cottonwoods of the Verde Valley to fraternize with\r\n     its smaller relative, Baird’s woodpecker, and only when the\r\n     mountain timber is icy or the weather uncommonly fierce;\r\n     then it is usually accompanied by flocks of Cassin’s Purple\r\n     Finches, Red-backed Juncos, and its boon companions, the\r\n     Slender-billed Nuthatches. About the middle of June the\r\n     young leave their nests, and soon after make a partial\r\n     migration downward towards the lower border of the pine\r\n     belt, in common with many other birds that breed at high\r\n     levels.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--I can find no references to the nesting habits or eggs of\r\nthis subspecies, which probably do not differ materially from those of\r\nthe Chihuahua woodpecker, except that J. S. Ligon told Mrs. Florence M.\r\nBailey (1928) that it nests “generally in small trees in canyon beds.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The eggs of this subspecies are apparently similar to those of\r\nother hairy woodpeckers. They seem to be scarce in collections; I have\r\nbeen able to locate only two sets of eggs, one set of four and one set\r\nof three. These seven eggs show average measurements of 24.66 by 17.91\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =25.3= by 18.2,\r\n24.6 by =18.6=, =24.2= by 18.2, and 24.6 by =17.2= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Mrs. Bailey (1928) quotes Maj. E. A. Goldman as follows:\r\n\r\n     One afternoon I found one pecking at a hole near the ground\r\n     in the trunk of an oak. It worked for a second or two and\r\n     then paused long enough to look in my direction, beginning\r\n     work again immediately. This was repeated several times and\r\n     it seemed disinclined to leave the spot, allowing me to\r\n     approach to within ten feet, when, instead of flying off,\r\n     it slid around to the opposite side of the trunk while I\r\n     examined the place and found the hole inhabited by numerous\r\n     small black beetles which were running excitedly about.\r\n     I moved off a short distance and watched the Woodpecker\r\n     return to the hole which seemed to be a rich find.\r\n\r\nShe goes on to say:\r\n\r\n     On Chloride Creek in May, 1916, when Mr. Ligon was standing\r\n     by a half dead box elder containing a woodpecker nest, the\r\n     mother came with her bill for half its length jammed full\r\n     of wood ants for the squawking young inside the hole. One\r\n     that Mr. Kellogg took at Silver City had recently eaten two\r\n     woodboring larvae, six caterpillars, and at least ten moth\r\n     pupae, besides other insects and mast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               DRYOBATES PUBESCENS PUBESCENS (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\n                       SOUTHERN DOWNY WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nBecause the Linnaean name _Picus pubescens_ was based on Catesby’s\r\nsmallest spotted woodpecker, of South Carolina, the southern bird\r\nbecomes the type race of the species, and the above scientific name,\r\nwhich for many years was used for the more northern bird, is now\r\nrestricted to the downy woodpeckers of the Lower Austral Zone of the\r\nSouth Atlantic and Gulf States, from North Carolina to eastern Texas.\r\nWilliam Brewster (1897) has given us a full review of the changes\r\nthat have taken place in the nomenclature of the downy woodpeckers of\r\neastern North America, to which the reader is referred.\r\n\r\nThe southern downy woodpecker, _D. p. pubescens_, is smaller, from\r\nthe more southern parts of its range decidedly smaller, than the more\r\nnorthern bird, _D. p. medianus_, intergrading with it where the two\r\nranges meet; the under parts are more brownish, and the white markings\r\nof the wings and tail will average of less extent.\r\n\r\nThe haunts of this woodpecker are similar to those of its northern\r\nrelative, due allowance being made for the difference in environment.\r\nIt is a more sociable species than the hairy woodpecker and less of a\r\nwoodland bird.\r\n\r\nIn Florida, according to Arthur H. Howell (1932), “it occurs alike in\r\npine woods, hammocks, orchards, roadside hedges, and dooryards.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Mr. Howell (1932) says that, in Florida, “the nest of the\r\ndowny is usually dug in a decaying limb of a tree or occasionally in a\r\nfence post, and may be anywhere from 5 to 50 feet above the ground.”\r\nHarold H. Bailey (1925) says that “for the nesting site, they usually\r\nselect a dead stub of some live tree, preferring a hard one to a soft\r\nor decayed wood. The cavity is drilled each year anew by the birds,\r\nthe hole being about one and a quarter inches in diameter and eight to\r\ntwelve inches deep, varying in height from twenty to sixty feet above\r\nground.” John Helton, Jr., tells me of a nest he found on April 20,\r\nnear Troy, Ala., that “was drilled in a rotten oak limb, which had\r\nfallen, been caught, and was suspended among the branches of a pine. It\r\ncontained three small young and one infertile egg. The mother bird fed\r\nthe young with great regularity every three minutes.” M. G. Vaiden, of\r\nRosedale, Miss., writes to me of a nest 35 feet up in a dead snag of a\r\npecan tree; the limb was four inches in diameter and the cavity only\r\nfive inches deep. George Finlay Simmons (1925) says that, in Texas, it\r\nnests “10 to 20 feet from ground in small dead deciduous trees, or in\r\nold stumps or telegraph poles.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The eggs are like those of the northern downy but slightly\r\nsmaller. The measurements of 25 eggs average 19.43 by 15.24\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =20.8= by 14.9,\r\n20.6 by =16.7=, and =17.78= by =13.46= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Writing of the habits of these woodpeckers in the\r\nsandhills of North Carolina, Milton P. Skinner (1928) says:\r\n\r\n     They are seen at times with Chickadees, red-cockaded\r\n     woodpeckers, Brownheaded Nuthatches, Kinglets and Juncos.\r\n     And these associations seem to be actual and usual, and\r\n     not temporary and accidental ones as they are between\r\n     most birds of different species. The downy woodpeckers\r\n     are peaceable little fellows but other birds will impose\r\n     on them. I have seen a yellow-bellied sapsucker and a mob\r\n     of three or four English Sparrows near Pine Bluff chasing\r\n     one about. But downy was a fast flier and outflew all\r\n     his tormentors each time. Their flight is undulating and\r\n     typical of the woodpecker family. These woodpeckers have\r\n     one trait of the Brown Creepers--they prefer to work _up_ a\r\n     tree and fly _down_ to the base of the next one.\r\n\r\n     Perhaps a downy woodpecker does not really work any harder\r\n     or faster for its food than any other bird, but somehow it\r\n     seems that it does. I found one once on an inclined limb of\r\n     a catalpa near the Highland Pines Inn and watched it work\r\n     up ten feet in thirteen minutes. During that time downy’s\r\n     blows fell good and hard at the average of a hundred\r\n     strokes each minute except for a dozen momentary stops when\r\n     a big bird flew over, or the downy scratched its head. It\r\n     was feeding on small white grubs which it secured at an\r\n     average rate of four per minute. * * *\r\n\r\n     These woodpeckers have the habit in the Sandhills of\r\n     digging holes in which to sleep. One found a suitable\r\n     place in the end of a dead limb of a large gum standing in\r\n     a flooded swamp near Mid Pines Club. This limb had been\r\n     broken and left a stub sticking out about five feet long\r\n     at right angles to the trunk of the gum and about forty\r\n     feet above the ground. It was about five inches in diameter\r\n     where the woodpecker began work on it. Work was started\r\n     on the under side of the limb about nine inches from the\r\n     outer end on February 11, 1927, and the bird dug at it for\r\n     forty-five minutes to such good purpose that the hole would\r\n     then admit all its bill and half its head. As it worked\r\n     it clung head down under the limb. Then it left its work\r\n     to go foraging but came back in thirty minutes to resume\r\n     work. During the next three days this woodpecker must have\r\n     worked steadily for it then had a hole into which it could\r\n     completely disappear. But the hole was not large enough nor\r\n     deep enough, and the bird was still at work, continually\r\n     popping in and out (backward) of its hole; usually when it\r\n     backed out it carried a bill full of chips and shavings\r\n     that it threw over its shoulder. As it did so, it glanced\r\n     once or twice to either side as if to assure itself that\r\n     all was well. Then back into the hole for another period\r\n     of steady hammering. Apparently this woodpecker worked\r\n     thus from thirty minutes to an hour after each half hour’s\r\n     foraging trip. Two more days of work completed the sleeping\r\n     quarters in a snug cozy retreat. When finished, the hole\r\n     was six inches deep, and the limb around it was a mere\r\n     shell. The opening being beneath the limb, it was sheltered\r\n     from storms, and from any water running into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North America; nonmigratory.\r\n\r\nThe range of the downy woodpecker is =north= to Alaska (Russian\r\nMission, Tanana, and Fort Egbert); southwestern Mackenzie (Fort Simpson\r\nand Fort Providence); northern Alberta (Fort McMurray); central\r\nSaskatchewan (Big River and Prince Albert); southern Manitoba (Lake St.\r\nMartin, Shoal Lake, and Indian Bay); Ontario (Lac Seul, Gargantua, and\r\nSudbury); Quebec (Lake Mistassini, Godbout, and Natashguan River); and\r\nNewfoundland (Nicholsville and probably St. Johns). The =eastern= limit\r\nof the range extends =south= along the Atlantic coast from this point\r\nto southern Florida (Miami, Royal Palm Hammock, and Flamingo). From\r\nthis southeastern point the species is found westward along the Gulf\r\ncoast to Mississippi (Biloxi) and Louisiana (New Orleans), thence in\r\nthe interior to south-central Texas (Giddings and Pecos); southern New\r\nMexico (Mayhill, Cloudcroft, and Silver City); Arizona (San Francisco\r\nMountain and Fort Valley); and southern California (Escondido). The\r\n=western= limits extend nearly or quite to the Pacific coast north\r\nthrough California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia to Alaska\r\n(Sitka, Sitkalidak Island, Bethel, and Russian Mission).\r\n\r\nThe range as above outlined is for the entire species, which has been\r\nseparated into six subspecies. The typical form, the southern downy\r\nwoodpecker (_D. p. pubescens_), is found in the South Atlantic and\r\nGulf States north to North Carolina and Oklahoma; the northern downy\r\nwoodpecker (_D. p. medianus_) ranges north from Virginia, Tennessee,\r\nand Kansas (casually eastern Colorado) north to southern Alberta,\r\nManitoba, Quebec, and Newfoundland; Nelson’s downy woodpecker (_D. p.\r\nnelsoni_) ranges southeast from northwestern Alaska to central Alberta\r\nand is found casually even farther east; Batchelder’s woodpecker (_D.\r\np. leucurus_) is the Rocky Mountain form and is found from the Kenai\r\nPeninsula of Alaska south to New Mexico and Arizona, casually east to\r\nNebraska and on the coast of British Columbia; Gairdner’s woodpecker\r\n(_D. p. gairdneri_) is found on the Pacific coast from British Columbia\r\nsouth to northern California; and the willow woodpecker (_D. p.\r\nturati_) is confined to California, being distributed rather generally\r\nover the State except in the desert areas and the northwestern part.\r\n\r\nWhile the downy woodpecker is not migratory in the accepted sense of\r\nthe term, and during the months of November and December has been\r\nrecorded north to Mackenzie (Fort Simpson) and central Quebec (Lake\r\nMistassini), it appears to have some local movements and seems given\r\nto a certain amount of wandering after the close of the breeding\r\nseason. In some of the more northern areas it is commoner in winter\r\nthan in summer, while in the mountainous regions of the West there is\r\napparently a vertical movement in winter to the valley floors.\r\n\r\nWhile the files of the Biological Survey contain the data for more than\r\n4,600 of these birds that have been marked with numbered bands, many\r\nof which have been subsequently recovered, only one of these indicates\r\na flight of any distance from the point of banding. This bird (83460),\r\nbanded on February 2, 1925, at Elkader, Iowa, was found dead at Balsam\r\nLake, Wis., on October 25, 1925. The distance between the two points is\r\nabout 185 miles.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--Alberta: 12 records, May 25 to June 14.\r\n  California: 82 records, April 7 to June 9; 41 records, April 24 to\r\n    May 13, indicating the height of the season.\r\n  Colorado: 9 records, May 4 to June 30.\r\n  Florida: 7 records, April 2 to May 14.\r\n  Illinois: 16 records, April 3 to June 3; 8 records, May 12 to 20.\r\n  New York: 12 records, May 10 to June 2.\r\n  Washington: 8 records, May 1 to June 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                DRYOBATES PUBESCENS GAIRDNERI (Audubon)\r\n\r\n                         GAIRDNER’S WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThis subspecies of our well-known downy woodpecker is one of those\r\nwell-marked dark-colored races that occur in the humid Northwest coast\r\nregion, ranging in the Transition Zone from southern British Columbia\r\nto Mendocino County, Calif. It is practically a small edition of the\r\nequally dark Harris’s woodpecker, which inhabits the same region.\r\nIts characters are so well marked that it was recognized and named\r\nby Audubon (1842). Ridgway (1914) describes it as “similar to _D. p.\r\nturati_, but color of under parts darker (often light brownish gray or\r\ndrab), the white of back often tinged with brownish gray.”\r\n\r\nD. E. Brown, in his notes from western Washington, says: “Gairdner’s\r\nwoodpecker is next to the commonest woodpecker in western Washington,\r\nthe northwestern flicker being the only one that outnumbers it. This,\r\nthe smallest of the woodpeckers in this locality, is fond of old river\r\nbeds, willow swamps, and the deciduous trees along streams. It is found\r\nhere at all times of year but seems to be more in evidence in winter,\r\nprobably because the leaves are off the trees where it is usually\r\nfound.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Mr. Brown states further that “it digs its nesting cavity\r\nusually in a dead willow stub of small size, but at times it excavates,\r\nwith much labor, a cavity in a growing tree. Nests have been found as\r\nlow as 3 feet from the ground, and they are seldom more than 30 feet\r\nup. Three to six eggs are laid, five being the usual number. The first\r\nweek in May is the best time for fresh eggs. The incubating bird has\r\na habit that, I think, saves its eggs many times; when the stub that\r\ncontains the eggs is rapped, the sitting bird comes to the opening with\r\nits bill full of chips from the bottom of the nest; these are dropped\r\noutside, and the bird drops back into the nest, only to repeat this\r\naction when the rapping is repeated. I have seen this performance not\r\nonce but many times, and I think it a regular occurrence when the eggs\r\nare well incubated.”\r\n\r\nDawson and Bowles (1909) write: “Gairdners place their nests at\r\ninconsiderable heights in deciduous trees, and those, if possible,\r\namong thick growths on moist ground. Both sexes assist in excavation,\r\nas in incubation. Partially decayed wood is selected and an opening\r\nmade about an inch and a quarter in diameter. After driving straight\r\nin an inch or two, the passage turns down and widens two or three\r\ndiameters. At a depth of a foot or so the crystal white eggs are\r\ndeposited on a neat bed of fine chips. Incubation lasts twelve days and\r\nthe young are hatched about the 1st of June.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The eggs of Gairdner’s woodpecker resemble those of the\r\nnorthern downy (_medianus_) in every respect but average slightly\r\nsmaller. The measurements of 34 eggs average 18.71 by 14.51\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =20.83=\r\nby 15.24, 20.32 by =16.0=, =17.27= by 14.22, and 17.78 by =12.95=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Johnson A. Neff (1928) had 68 stomachs available for study,\r\nmostly Gairdner’s woodpeckers from the Willamette Valley, Oreg., and\r\nstates that--\r\n\r\n     the animal food items averaged 82.07 percent of the annual\r\n     food, and vegetable matter, 17.93 percent. * * *\r\n\r\n     At Peyton, in August, the Gairdner Woodpeckers were\r\n     observed working busily for several days removing the\r\n     larvae, pupae, and adults of weevils from the stems of\r\n     common mullen, _Verbascum thapsus_. * * *\r\n\r\n     During July, 1925, whole families of the Gairdner\r\n     Woodpecker were observed in the huge cottonwoods which\r\n     abound near the Willamette River, feeding on aphids and\r\n     scale. They often numbered as high as ten birds in one\r\n     tree, and worked from the lowest limb to the highest leaf.\r\n     While paying some attention to the branches, their chief\r\n     interest was in the clusters of leaves; they clambered out\r\n     each small branch to the group of leaves at the tip, peered\r\n     under each leaf intently, even swinging around sidewise\r\n     and up-side down in their efforts. Through the binoculars\r\n     it was easy to see them remove small objects and, later,\r\n     stomach analysis showed that most of the objects were scale\r\n     insects. * * *\r\n\r\n     These woodpeckers have yet to be observed doing any injury\r\n     to a living tree; the writer has been unable to find\r\n     any evidence of their doing so in this area. While they\r\n     nested abundantly in the river-bottom lands in very close\r\n     companionship with true sapsuckers, they were never seen to\r\n     visit the flowing sap pits. * * *\r\n\r\n     Fruit was hardly touched by these birds; elderberry\r\n     (_Sambucus_) and Madrona (_Arbutus_) were the only kinds\r\n     found, averaging only 0.46 percent of the diet. * * *\r\n\r\n     The Gairdner, Willow, and Batchelder Woodpeckers in the\r\n     orchard are worth their weight in gold to the fruit grower.\r\n     They should be strictly protected, and every known means of\r\n     attraction should be used in the attempt to persuade them\r\n     to remain about the ranches.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Anderson and Grinnell (1903) say that, in the Siskiyou\r\nMountains, Calif., “the Gairdner woodpecker is usually to be found in\r\ncompany with the flocks of mountain chickadees which frequent the black\r\noak groves all winter. The oaks are their favorite working places, but\r\nthey are also to be seen among the pines and spruces. Six specimens\r\nbrought home are all quite near _gairdneri_. The smokiness of the lower\r\nsurface is not so intense as in skins from western Oregon, but the\r\nsize, especially of the feet, is decidedly that of the northwest coast\r\nform.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                DRYOBATES PUBESCENS LEUCURUS (Hartlaub)\r\n\r\n                        BATCHELDER’S WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe downy woodpecker inhabiting the Rocky Mountains and adjacent\r\nregions from southern Alaska to Arizona and New Mexico is described by\r\nRidgway (1914) as “similar in large size and whiteness of under parts\r\nto _D. p. nelsoni_, but with less of white on wing-coverts, sometimes\r\nwith none, the spots, when present, only on terminal or (usually)\r\nsubterminal portion, and on only a few of the covert features.” It\r\nalso differs from it in a “tendency to reduction or absence of bars on\r\nlateral rectrices.”\r\n\r\nThe common name of this woodpecker is in honor of Charles F.\r\nBatchelder, who first (1889) called the attention of American\r\nornithologists to the characters of this race under the name _D. p.\r\noreoecus_. Batchelder’s name was used in the 1895 A. O. U. Check-List,\r\nbut it was later found to be antedated by _Dryobates homorus_ of\r\nCabanis and Heine, which was adopted in the 1910 Check-List. This was\r\nfound to be still further antedated by the name _Picus leucurus_, given\r\nto the downy woodpecker of the Rocky Mountains by Hartlaub in 1852. It\r\nseems rather strange that this race remained so long unrecognized in\r\nthis country. This may be due to the fact that this woodpecker seems to\r\nbe a comparatively rare bird throughout most of its range.\r\n\r\nThe Weydemeyers (1928) say of its occurrence in northwestern Montana:\r\n\r\n     A rather rare permanent resident, irregular in winter.\r\n     Occurs throughout the county, but is rare at high\r\n     elevations. It frequents mixed broad-leaf and conifer woods\r\n     along the lower streams, where it undoubtedly breeds in\r\n     preference to other locations. During winter it is often\r\n     seen about farmsteads and pastures, and in bordering woods\r\n     of Douglas fir, yellow pine, and larch. In the Canadian\r\n     zone it occurs sparingly in lodgepole pine and alpine fir\r\n     (_Abies lasiocarpa_) woods, usually along streams.\r\n\r\n     In the western half of the county, an observer may consider\r\n     himself fortunate to see an individual of this species\r\n     twice a week. In the eastern portion, during July and\r\n     August, along Transition zone streams, one or two birds may\r\n     be seen nearly every day.\r\n\r\n     We have obtained no definite nesting dates for this\r\n     species, although it evidently breeds in suitable\r\n     locations. On July 22, 1923, a brood of young on the wing\r\n     was seen near Fortine in woods of spruce and aspen, in the\r\n     Transition zone, at 2,960 feet altitude.\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) writes:\r\n\r\n     Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, United States Army, reports it\r\n     breeding sparingly throughout the _Pinus ponderosa_ belt,\r\n     ascending into the Spruce zone, on the San Francisco\r\n     cone, and considers it the rarest of the woodpeckers\r\n     found in Arizona. Mr. Denis Gale took a nest and eggs\r\n     of this subspecies in Boulder County, Colorado, on June\r\n     12, 1889. The excavation was found in a half-dead aspen,\r\n     30 feet from the ground, and presumably well up in the\r\n     mountains, as Mr. William G. Smith informs me that it is\r\n     only a winter visitor in the lower valleys, and is never\r\n     seen there during warm weather. I found it rare near Fort\r\n     Custer, Montana, and only obtained a single male specimen,\r\n     on November 23, 1884, among the willows and cottonwoods\r\n     on the Little Horn River. Dr. James C. Merrill, United\r\n     States Army, met with it breeding at Fort Shaw, Mont.,\r\n     early in June, 1879, and tells me that five or six eggs are\r\n     generally laid to a set, and that the nesting habits are\r\n     just like those of the downy woodpecker.\r\n\r\nLee R. Dice (1918) says that, in southeastern Washington, it is\r\n“numerous throughout the year in the timber along the Touchet River\r\nnear Prescott.\r\n\r\n“* * * On June 11, 1908, a nest containing young was found four feet\r\nfrom the ground in an apple tree near Prescott. The female was seen\r\ngathering large, red aphids from nearby golden-rod. She would gather\r\nall her mouth could hold and until the aphids stuck out like a fringe\r\nall around the edges of the bill. Then she flew in a direct line toward\r\nthe nest. This female was also seen to gather aphids from apple trees.”\r\n\r\nA set of four eggs in the Thayer collection was taken near Fort Shaw,\r\nMont., on June 8, 1879; the nesting cavity was 12 feet from the ground\r\nin a dead tree and was excavated to a depth of 10 inches. The eggs are\r\ncharacteristic of the species, short-ovate in shape, dull white in\r\ncolor, and only slightly glossy.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of 28 eggs average 19.86 by 15.29 millimeters; the\r\neggs showing the four extremes measure =23.37= by =16.00=, =19.0= by\r\n14.8, and 18.4 by =14.4= millimeters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                DRYOBATES PUBESCENS MEDIANUS (Swainson)\r\n\r\n                       NORTHERN DOWNY WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                              PLATES 7, 8\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\n                  CONTRIBUTED BY WINSOR MARRETT TYLER\r\n\r\nThe downy woodpecker, including six geographical forms, inhabits nearly\r\nthe whole of the wooded parts of North America. It is absent or rare\r\non the arid deserts and less common in the densely forested regions\r\nthan some of the larger woodpeckers; its favorite country is the open\r\nwoodland that covers a large part of the United States.\r\n\r\nWhen civilized man invaded their territory, the downy woodpeckers of\r\nthe Atlantic coast--the northern and southern races--did not retreat\r\nbefore his advance but accepted as a home the orchards and shade trees\r\nwith which man replaced the forest. At the present time it builds its\r\nnest sometimes within sight from our windows and often in the parks\r\nof our large cities. It is one of the best known of our permanent\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\nThe ornithologists of a century ago show unanimity in their\r\ncharacterization of the bird. Audubon (1842) remarks that it “is\r\nperhaps not surpassed by any of its tribe in hardiness, industry, or\r\nvivacity”; Wilson (1832) says that “the principal characteristics\r\nof this little bird are diligence, familiarity, perseverance” and\r\nspeaks of a pair of the birds working at their nest “with the most\r\nindefatigable diligence”; and Nuttall (1832) characteristically shares\r\nWilson’s opinion even to the extent of employing his exact words,\r\n“indefatigable diligence,” in his own account of the building of the\r\nnest. Nearly a hundred years later Forbush (1927), when near the end\r\nof his long life, put the seal of his approval upon this sentiment,\r\nexpressed long ago, by summarizing the downy as a “model of patient\r\nindustry and perseverance.”\r\n\r\nBacked by these authorities we may regard the downy woodpecker as a\r\nbird with a stable and well-balanced nature, a bird which, unconcerned\r\nby the rush and traffic “of these most brisk and giddy-paced times,”\r\nstill perseveres in its “indefatigable diligence.”\r\n\r\n_Spring and courtship._--As spring advances, the downy woodpecker\r\nseems to wake up; it attracts our notice by its more frequent notes\r\nand increased activity. During the cold months of the year the bird\r\nhas been comparatively silent, although even in the depth of winter we\r\nmay occasionally hear its single _chip_ and even the long whinny, but\r\nin April, for so sedate a bird, it becomes a lively personality; it\r\nmoves about quickly--sometimes with lightninglike agility--and takes a\r\nvoluble interest in the members of its own species.\r\n\r\nFrancis H. Allen, in his notes, gives the two following graphic\r\naccounts of the initial stage of the bird’s courtship: “April 10, 1904.\r\nWest Roxbury, Mass. I found two downy woodpeckers courting--at least, I\r\nsuppose that was what they were up to. They acted like mating flickers,\r\nchasing each other about from tree to tree, keeping almost constantly\r\non the move and only pausing now and then to execute a sort of dance,\r\nspreading their wings and tails. From time to time I heard from them a\r\nlong call resembling the flicker’s _whick, whick whick whick_, etc.,\r\nbut higher pitched than the flicker’s and, of course, not so loud. Less\r\noften I heard another note--a softer, slighter, more hurried call,\r\nsimilar in quality. I did not make out whether, these two calls were\r\nmade by different sexes, nor did I positively make out that the birds\r\nwere a pair, they kept in such constant motion. At least once one lit\r\ncrosswise of a twig. At last one flew off, and then the familiar and\r\ncharacteristic long call of a downy sounded from another direction, and\r\nthe remaining bird flew over to the third bird, which was clinging to\r\nthe trunk of an elm. Then these two stayed in each other’s company but\r\ndid not conduct so elaborate a dance as the first couple.\r\n\r\n“All this time a fourth bird had been drumming on a tree not far away.\r\nI went up to the place and timed the drum calls, finding each roll to\r\nlast about two seconds. I could not count the taps, but thought they\r\nnumbered eight or ten to each roll. While I watched this bird, another\r\ndowny came along, sounding the flickerlike call, but rather faintly,\r\nand the drummer flew to join her. They flew off together. I believe\r\nit is only the male that drums, and I think it probable that the bird\r\nthat answered the drummer was the one that had taken part in the dance\r\nbefore described, for that bird when she left her partner had flown off\r\nin this direction.\r\n\r\n“April 8, 1917. West Roxbury. Watched a pair courting this morning for\r\nseveral minutes. Both sexes had a curious ‘weaving’ action, moving the\r\nhead and whole body from side to side on the tip of the tail as a pivot\r\nwith the neck stretched out and bill pointed on a line with the body,\r\nand the whole body elongated. They did this both when clinging to the\r\nside of a trunk and when on a horizontal or slanting branch. They were\r\nsilent but very active, flitting one after the other from branch to\r\nbranch and tree to tree, but making only short flights. The waving, or\r\n‘weaving,’ motion of the head was rather rapid, perhaps two waves, that\r\nis from left to right and back again, in about a second--but this is\r\nstated from general impressions and memory only. These birds did not\r\nspread the wings and tail as did the courting pair observed on April\r\n10, 1904, and, as stated, they uttered no note.”\r\n\r\nMy notes refer to a bit of courtship observed during the actual\r\nbreeding season, May 11, 1911, in a wooded swamp in Lexington, Mass.,\r\nwhere the species used to nest every year. The female bird was perched\r\nmotionless along a horizontal limb of a tree, and the male was poised\r\nin the air just behind and a little above her. He was hovering. His\r\nwings were more than half spread, I should say, and waving slowly up\r\nand down, a maneuver which displayed finely the rows of white spots on\r\nthe flight feathers and coverts.\r\n\r\nWilliam Brewster (1936), in his Concord journal under date of May 5,\r\n1905, notes another form of courtship. He says: “At 8 A. M. saw a\r\npair of Downy Woodpeckers in young oaks behind Ball’s Hill, behaving\r\nvery strangely. They kept flying from tree to tree, flapping their\r\nwings slowly and feebly like butterflies, sometimes moving on a level\r\nplane, sometimes in long loops, occasionally sailing from tree to tree\r\nin a long _deep_ loop. Their wings had a strange fin-like appearance\r\ndue, probably, to the way they were held or flexed. They both uttered\r\na low, harsh, chattering cry, almost incessantly. No doubt this was a\r\nlove performance, but they were male and female and both ‘showed off’\r\nin the same way.”\r\n\r\nLewis O. Shelley (1932), who, at East Westmoreland, N. H., has had an\r\nextensive experience with banded birds throughout the year, describes\r\nthe courtship thus:\r\n\r\n     Courtship activities begin rather early with the male’s\r\n     tattooing commencing in the warm days of March. I believe\r\n     the most active mating display is given by a new male that\r\n     desires a mate, not by a male mated the previous year whose\r\n     mate is still living. The latter male seems to give a\r\n     protective display to its rival, seemingly just enough to\r\n     hold his mate’s trust.\r\n\r\n     In the spring of 1931, father and son * * * fought for and\r\n     sought the favor of the young female * * * the son finally\r\n     winning after days of courtship in our yard and vicinity.\r\n     * * * Courting lasted for upwards of two weeks, or perhaps\r\n     longer, before the female made her choice. Of the two\r\n     rivals the son finally was accepted, the older male shortly\r\n     disappearing. * * * The courtship display of these three\r\n     birds was the same as I have observed with other mating\r\n     Downy Woodpeckers elsewhere in past seasons. At my station\r\n     the mating activities began when the birds first met and\r\n     was continued more or less regularly thereafter. The\r\n     female is usually rather quiet, sometimes giving a _week,\r\n     week, week, week_, or again a squeaking note. The males\r\n     give forth a loud _wick, wick, wick, wick, wick, wick_,\r\n     sometimes with a rolling _k-k-k-k-k_ at the end. Very\r\n     little drumming on resonant objects is done by the male,\r\n     once a female is located, and in this case almost none was\r\n     done except when one male was out of sight and hearing\r\n     of the female and the other courting bird. To the casual\r\n     observer, the chasing of the female by the male to a tree,\r\n     and from tree to tree, in a seemingly idle manner (often,\r\n     but not always, by both males) is in reality a part of the\r\n     mating manoeuvres.\r\n\r\n     When it happens that both males are in pursuit, the\r\n     activities take on an added impetus. I have a number of\r\n     times seen one male dash headlong across a fifty-yard\r\n     opening to where the other two birds were, loudly uttering\r\n     his cry, and, when alighting, dash at his adversary, the\r\n     female squeaking intermittently, and swinging her body\r\n     from side to side. The display also consists of spread\r\n     wings nervously fluttered; raising and lowering of the\r\n     scarlet patch; mad dashes from one tree to another at the\r\n     fleeing female, who dodges to the opposite side of the\r\n     tree as the pursuing bird alights; loud calls at intervals\r\n     when he stops in his mad hopping up the limbs and smaller\r\n     branches. This activity may last from five to thirty\r\n     minutes, from the large elm in our yard, where the birds\r\n     feed, to a larger area either south or east of the house.\r\n     When two birds are alone together, it is common to find\r\n     them perching near together and motionless for considerable\r\n     periods of time, but let the second male appear and the\r\n     first male will drive the female from the tree and the\r\n     round is begun again. When two males come face to face in\r\n     a headlong rush, wings spread, crest raised, and beak open\r\n     in a challenging attitude, it is mostly sham, for they\r\n     soon quiet down unless one advances up the tree toward the\r\n     female clinging immovable above.\r\n\r\n     There is a period when the male is very active in his\r\n     rushing of the female--I suppose to make sure of his\r\n     desire, a mate--but this phase of courtship plays no part\r\n     in the act of copulation, which I have seen enacted early\r\n     in the morning, a quiet, matter-of-fact performance.\r\n\r\nThe first and last paragraphs of this quotation are taken from Mr.\r\nShelley’s manuscript notes.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The downy woodpecker nests in a cavity that the birds\r\nthemselves drill in a branch or stub 8 feet (rarely less) to 50 feet\r\n(rarely more) above the ground, generally in dead or dying wood,\r\nsometimes in a solid branch. The entrance, one and a quarter inches\r\nin diameter, is just large enough to admit the bird’s body, and is\r\nperfectly circular unless some bits of soft wood chip off. The cavity\r\nis roughly gourd-shaped, turning downward and widening soon after\r\npenetrating the wood and extends to a depth varying normally from eight\r\nto twelve inches. Generally a few chips are left in the bottom of the\r\ncavity.\r\n\r\nLewis O. Shelley says (MS.) that according to his experience “the\r\nfemale selects the nest site on her winter, or year-round, territory.”\r\nHe speaks of a female that in the fall “partly dug out a cavity,\r\nsupposedly for her winter quarters, but the following summer I found a\r\nbrood of young of this same bird occupying the nest.”\r\n\r\nWriters are almost unanimously of the opinion that both birds of the\r\npair excavate the nest, but Shelley (MS.) states: “Of a number of nests\r\nobserved, I have never known the male downy to assist in excavating. He\r\noften comes near when the female is working, but this seems to be an\r\nunderstood signal for her to cease work and go off in his company.”\r\n\r\nA. Dawes DuBois, in a letter to Mr. Bent, describes the behavior of a\r\npair working jointly on a nest in Ithaca, N. Y., about 15 feet up in\r\nan old stub. He says: “These birds were working the lower depths. The\r\npartners worked alternately. First the female lighted on the stub and\r\ndisappeared within the cavity. Immediately she thrust out her head,\r\nand, with a quick shake, disposed of a billful of chips. She repeated\r\nthis a number of times. She was throwing out the loose chips from\r\nthe bottom of the cavity. Soon she began to chisel, remaining inside\r\nwhere we could not see her. After she had been working for five or six\r\nminutes, her mate flew to the stub and uttered a chirp, whereupon the\r\nfemale came out and flew away.\r\n\r\n“The male went in to continue the work by a somewhat different method.\r\nHe was never entirely lost to view--his tail was always visible--and he\r\nbacked out of the hole to dispose of the chips. He ruffled his feathers\r\nconsiderably in squirming out backward, as his body was a snug fit\r\nin the entrance hole. He threw out a quantity of loose chips in this\r\nmanner and then began chiseling, his tail meanwhile protruding from the\r\ndoorway. He worked for 22 minutes; then his mate came back.\r\n\r\n“She went inside and came out with her mouth quite full of chips; but\r\ninstead of tossing the chips to the ground, she flew off with them to\r\nanother tree. She stayed away for several minutes, then returned and\r\nwent to work in her accustomed way, staying within the cavity, and\r\nthrusting only her head outside. When she had worked about 15 minutes\r\nthe male came again to the entrance. She put her head out of the\r\ndoorway; they rubbed their bills together, and chirped a few remarks.\r\nThe female then flew away and the male took up the task again.”\r\n\r\nAudubon (1842) says: “About the middle of April it begins to form\r\nits nest, shewing little care as to the kind of tree it selects for\r\nthe purpose, although it generally chooses a sound one, sometimes,\r\nhowever, taking one that is partially decayed. The pair work together\r\nfor several days before the hole is completed, sometimes perhaps a\r\nwhole week, as they dig it to a depth of a foot or sixteen inches. The\r\ndirection is sometimes perpendicularly downwards from the commencement,\r\nsometimes transverse to the tree for four or five inches, and then\r\nlongitudinal. The hole is rendered smooth and conveniently large\r\nthroughout, the entrance being perfectly round, and just large enough\r\nto admit one bird at a time.”\r\n\r\nA. Dawes DuBois (MS.) writes that the male bird of a pair was caught in\r\na nest 6 feet from the ground, evidently incubating the six eggs well\r\nadvanced in development. This observation is in accord with the general\r\nbelief that the male takes his share in incubation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Alice Hall Walter (1912) states that “in the North, only one brood\r\nis raised during a season; but it is not uncommon in the South for one\r\nbrood to be raised in May and a second in August.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--[AUTHOR’S NOTE: The northern downy woodpecker lays ordinarily\r\nfour or five eggs, though sets of three or six are not rare, and as\r\nmany as seven or even eight eggs have been found in a nest. The eggs\r\nare pure white, either dull white or more or less glossy, and they\r\nvary in shape from ovate to rounded-ovate. The measurements of 55 eggs\r\naverage 19.35 by 15.05 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes\r\nmeasure =22.35= by =16.26=, =17.78= by 14.73, and 18.80 by =13.97=\r\nmillimeters.]\r\n\r\n_Young._--The incubation period of the downy woodpecker is 12 days,\r\naccording to Frank L. Burns (1915) and Dr. Arthur A. Allen (1928).\r\n\r\nWhether in their earliest days the young birds, hidden in the depths of\r\ntheir dark chamber, are fed by regurgitation has not been determined,\r\nbut very soon after they leave the egg food is brought directly to\r\nthem. Dr. Allen (MS.) says: “Certainly by the time the young are four\r\nor five days old entire insects are brought in the parents’ bills and\r\ngiven to the young; I have photographic proof of this.”\r\n\r\nCraig S. Thoms (1927), in a study of the nesting habits in South\r\nDakota, says: “On June 9 the young were beginning to come up to the\r\ndoor of their excavation to receive food. Presumably the largest and\r\nstrongest sticks his head clear out. When he fed he subsided and the\r\nnext came up, but not quite so far. He in his turn subsided and the\r\nparent entered to feed the weaker ones still farther down. * * *\r\n\r\n“On June 12 the last of the young left the nest, which upon being\r\nmeasured was found to be 10 inches deep.”\r\n\r\nA. Dawes DuBois (MS.) tells of the flight of the young birds from the\r\nnest: “The young chattered most of the time during the last two days of\r\nnest life. One at a time they looked out a great deal at the strange\r\nouter world. They left the nest on June 11. The last two, a male and a\r\nfemale, left during the afternoon, each after being fed at the entrance\r\nand seeing the parent fly away. The young male flew from the nest hole\r\nstraight to a tree 60 feet away. His sister quickly followed, lighting\r\non the trunk of the same tree and following her parent up the hole in\r\nthe hitching manner of their kind as though she had been practicing\r\nthis vertical locomotion all her life.”\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--[AUTHOR’S NOTE: Young downy woodpeckers are hatched naked\r\nand blind, but the juvenal plumage is acquired before the young leave\r\nthe nest. In this first plumage, the young male is much like the adult\r\nmale, except that the red nuchal patch is lacking; the forehead is\r\nblack, spotted with white, but the crown and occiput are more or less\r\nmarked with various shades of red, pinkish, or yellowish, as well as\r\nspotted with white; the black portions of the plumage are duller than\r\nin the adult; the sides of the breast are streaked and the flanks\r\nobscurely spotted with dusky; the white areas, underparts, and white\r\nspots elsewhere, as well as the rectrices, are tinged with yellowish.\r\n\r\nThe young female is like the young male, except that there is no red on\r\nthe head, and the crown is clear black, or black spotted with white.\r\nL. L. Snyder (1923) has shown that young males sometimes have only\r\nwhite markings on a black crown and that young females sometimes have\r\nreddish, pinkish, or yellowish markings on the crown.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal plumage is worn but a short time, for a complete molt,\r\nbeginning in September or earlier, produces a first winter plumage,\r\nwhich is practically adult. Adults have a complete annual molt from\r\nJuly to September. Both adults and young show a tinge of yellowish in\r\nthe white areas in fresh fall plumage, which gradually fades away.]\r\n\r\n_Food._--F. E. L. Beal (1911) in an examination of the contents of 723\r\nstomachs of the downy woodpecker found that 76.05 percent was animal\r\nmatter, the remaining 23.95 percent vegetable matter. The following\r\nquotations are from his exhaustive report.\r\n\r\n     Beetles taken collectively amount to 21.55 percent, and are\r\n     the largest item of the food. Of these, a little less than\r\n     14 percent are wood-boring larvae. * * * They were found in\r\n     289 stomachs, or about 40 percent of all, and 10 contained\r\n     no other food. This is only about half the amount found in\r\n     the stomachs of the hairy woodpecker, and shows that the\r\n     downy pecks wood much less than the hairy. These larvae\r\n     are eaten at all times of the year, though the most are\r\n     taken in the cooler months. * * * The economic value of the\r\n     destruction of these larvae is very great.\r\n\r\n     Weevils amount to a little more than 3 percent, but appear\r\n     to be a rather favorite food, as they were found in 107\r\n     stomachs. * * *\r\n\r\n     Ants are eaten by the downy to the extent of 21.36 percent\r\n     of its diet, and are taken more regularly than any other\r\n     element of the food. * * *\r\n\r\n     Caterpillars appear to be a very acceptable food for the\r\n     downy woodpecker, as they constitute 16.50 percent of the\r\n     yearly diet. * * *\r\n\r\n     Fruit was eaten to the extent of 5.85 percent of the whole\r\n     food. Most of it is of useless wild varieties. * * *\r\n\r\n     The charge sometimes made that the downy injures trees by\r\n     eating the inner bark is disproved. It eats cambium rarely\r\n     and in small quantities.\r\n\r\nBeal gives a list of 20 seeds and fruits found in the downy’s food.\r\n\r\nSummarizing his findings, he says: “The foregoing discussion of the\r\nfood of the downy woodpecker shows it to be one of our most useful\r\nspecies. The only complaint against the bird is on the score of\r\ndisseminating the poisonous species of Rhus. However, it is fortunate\r\nthat the bird can live on this food when it is difficult to procure\r\nanything else. The insect food selected by the downy is almost all of\r\nspecies economically harmful.”\r\n\r\nForbush (1927) lays stress on the usefulness of the downy to man; he\r\nsays that it “searches out the pine weevil which kills the topmost\r\nshoot of the young white pine and so causes a crook in the trunk of the\r\ntree, unfitting it for the lumber market.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Alice Hall Walter (1912) shows how well the downy is equipped to\r\nsecure its food. She says that the feet, two toes in front and two\r\nbehind, “serve to _clamp_ the bird to the tree.” She continues:\r\n\r\n     Additional support is furnished by the stiff, sharply\r\n     pointed tail-feathers, that act as a brace when the bird\r\n     delivers heavy blows with its beak. Effective as this\r\n     tool is for the work of _hammer_, _wedge_, _drill_ and\r\n     _pick-axe_, it could not obtain the deeply hidden grubs\r\n     known as “borers,” from their tortuous, tunneled grooves,\r\n     without the aid of the long, slender, extensile tongue. In\r\n     the case of the Hairy and Downy, as well as some others of\r\n     the family, this remarkable tool is provided with barbs,\r\n     converting it into a spear, which may be hurled one inch,\r\n     two inches or even more, beyond the tip of the beak.\r\n\r\nA. Dawes DuBois says in his notes: “I have seen a downy woodpecker\r\nindustriously applying the percussion test to the dried stalks of\r\nthe previous summer’s horse weeds, which grow to prodigious size in\r\nthe creek bottoms near Springfield, Illinois. He went up each stalk,\r\ntapping it lightly, and frequently stopping to pierce the shell and\r\nextract a worm from the pith. I found that the weed stems he had\r\nvisited were punctured and splintered in numerous places.”\r\n\r\nThe following note by Elliott R. Tibbets (1911) shows how agile the\r\ndowny is on the wing. He was watching some birds at a feeding shelf. “I\r\nwas told,” he says, “to throw a cracked nut into the air and see what\r\nfollowed--I did so, and, to my surprise, the Downy darted after it, not\r\nallowing it to touch the ground, and then returned to the evergreen,\r\nwhere he proceeded to pick the kernel from the hard shell.”\r\n\r\nHenry D. Minot (1877) also mentions that they “catch insects on the\r\nwing.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The downy woodpecker sits very still as it digs out a\r\ngrub from under the bark of a tree, or from the wood under the bark,\r\nor as it dislodges a bit of bark in its hunt for a cocoon or a bundle\r\nof insects’ eggs. We hear the gentle taps of its bill, and when our\r\neyes, led by the sound, catch sight of the bird, perched on a branch or\r\nthe trunk of a tree, we understand why it has been called industrious.\r\nIt is concentrated on its work; it works patiently, seriously, like a\r\ncarpenter working earnestly with his chisel, spending a full minute,\r\nsometimes more, to secure a bit of food.\r\n\r\nAs it sits there quietly, working painstakingly at the bark, it gives\r\nthe impression of a rather sedentary bird, deliberate and staid,\r\nbut when it begins to move about--taking short flights among the\r\nbranches--alighting on little swaying twigs and flitting off again--we\r\nsee it in another mood. It is lively now; all deliberateness is gone.\r\nIt hops upward over the branches with quick jerky hops, rearing back a\r\nlittle after each one; it may descend a little way by backward hitches;\r\nit winds about the smaller branches, peering at the right side, the\r\nleft side, and around at the back; it flits to a twig no thicker than a\r\npencil for the space of a single peck, and then is off with the speed\r\nof an arrow, weaving and undulating through a maze of branchlets,\r\ncutting the air audibly with its wings.\r\n\r\nWe can watch the downy woodpecker best in winter when the trees and\r\nshrubs are bare. But even in such an exposed situation as a leafless\r\ntree, we do not find it a conspicuous bird--one hop and it is hidden\r\nbehind a branch, seeming almost to glide out of our sight. At the\r\nslightest alarm it disappears; it uses a branch as a shield--slipping\r\nbehind it, safe from observation or attack.\r\n\r\nThe bird is at home also in shrubbery, moving easily among the smaller\r\nbranches, hitching along their slender length, picking at the bark, and\r\nleaping from one branch to another with the aid of a flip of the wings.\r\nIt sits crosswise on a perch scarcely bigger than a twig, leaning\r\nforward a little, bill outstretched, suggesting in position and outline\r\na tiny kingfisher.\r\n\r\nHere, at close range, on a level with our eyes, we realize how rapid\r\nthe bird’s motions are. The beak strikes and draws back--the two\r\nmovements a single flash. The head turns to one side, to the other\r\nside, bringing first one dark shining eye, then the other, to bear on\r\nthe bark; we see the head in the two positions, although we get only a\r\nhint of the motion between.\r\n\r\nThus the day’s work goes on, until the downy, replete with the results\r\nof its industry, rests motionless for a while on a high, sunny branch,\r\ntaking its ease.\r\n\r\nThe downy woodpecker, like most of its family, has an undulating flight\r\nwhen flying any considerable distance. The undulations are not deep, as\r\nin the plunging flight of a goldfinch; it gives rather the effect of a\r\nship pitching slightly in a head sea. A few strokes carry the bird up\r\nto the crest of the wave--the wings clapping close to the sides of the\r\nbody--then, at the crest, with the wings shut, the bird tilts slightly\r\nforward, and slides down into the next trough.\r\n\r\nBesides employing its strong beak and the powerful muscles of its neck\r\nto secure food and dig out a cavity for its nest, the downy woodpecker\r\nmakes use of them to beat a loud tattoo on the branch of a tree or some\r\nother resonant object. This habit is oftenest noticed in spring, when\r\nit appears to form a part of courtship or a prelude to it, but Lewis\r\nO. Shelley says in his notes that “on February 3, 1934, a male downy\r\ncommenced its drumming on a dead elm branch near the house. A few hours\r\nearlier the temperature had been 5° below zero. On the 6th, 8th, and\r\n9th he was tattooing at the usual hour, about 8 a. m. On the 8th the\r\ntemperature registered zero, and on the 9th 18° below zero!”\r\n\r\nDr. Charles W. Townsend, in his Ipswich manuscript notes, under date\r\nof March 16, 1930, speaks of “a male bird hammering a _rat-at-at-too_\r\non the apex of a telephone pole for three seconds. He then paused,\r\nhunching up a little and looking about for from five to twelve seconds,\r\nbefore resuming the hammering. He made a small round dent in the pole,\r\nbut there were no chips.”\r\n\r\nA. Dawes DuBois tells in his notes the following anecdote: “One April\r\nday I watched this avian drummer as he entertained himself by beating\r\non the wooden insulator-pins of an unused cross-arm on a telegraph\r\npole. From each pin he rang out a different tone--loud, clear, and\r\nhigh-pitched. It was evident that this pleased him, for he hopped from\r\none pin to another to repeat the variations.”\r\n\r\nI have found in the books no mention of drumming by the female downy,\r\nbut at the end of the extract from William Brewster’s notes, quoted\r\nunder “Courtship,” in which he describes a mutual display by a pair of\r\nbirds, he adds: “Both sexes drum, also.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Brewster (1876b) points out the difference between the tattoo\r\nof the downy woodpecker and that of the hairy woodpecker and the\r\nyellow-bellied sapsucker. He says: “_P. pubescens_ has a long unbroken\r\nroll, _P. villosus_ a shorter and louder one with a greater interval\r\nbetween each stroke: while _S. varius_ commencing with a short roll\r\nends very emphatically with five or six distinct disconnected taps.”\r\n\r\nR. Owen Merriam (1920) gives, from Hamilton, Canada, an instance of\r\n“snow bathing.” He says:\r\n\r\n     This morning a female Downy Woodpecker that I was watching\r\n     flew to a horizontal branch and proceeded vigorously to\r\n     bathe in the loose snow lying there. Like a Robin in a\r\n     puddle, Mrs. Downy ducked her head, ruffled her feathers,\r\n     and fluttered her wings, throwing some of the snow over\r\n     her back and scattering the rest to the winds. As all the\r\n     snow fell off one part of the branch, she moved along to\r\n     another, until she had cleared a place about two feet\r\n     long. Two forks held more snow than the straight limb, and\r\n     apparently Mrs. Downy enjoyed herself immensely when she\r\n     came to them.\r\n\r\nDr. Arthur A. Allen (1928) in his admirable “Downy Woodpecker’s Story,”\r\npublished in the School Department of Bird-Lore, says, letting the bird\r\ntell its own story: “When cold weather sets in, * * * I begin drilling\r\nroosting-holes where I can spend the nights. I usually have to drill\r\nquite a number for they seem to be quite popular with other birds like\r\nthe Chickadees and Nuthatches, and sometimes when I get ready to retire\r\nI find my hole occupied by a flying squirrel or a whole family of deer\r\nmice, and it is easier to drill a new hole than to drive them out.\r\nOne winter I got tired of drilling holes and every night retired to a\r\nbird-house and perched on an old Wren’s nest that was in it.”\r\n\r\nMany ornithologists, even as long ago as the time of Wilson and\r\nNuttall, have believed that the rows of small holes, such as we\r\ncommonly see in the bark of our orchard trees, are drilled by the downy\r\nwoodpecker. These little holes, about three-eighths of an inch across,\r\ncircular when old, but oval when fresh, are arranged in fairly regular\r\nrows parallel to the ground, and sometimes in tiers, when they have\r\nthe appearance of a waffle. In settled regions they are found oftenest\r\nin the trunks and the larger branches of trees belonging to the rose\r\nfamily--most commonly of all in apple trees. The holes may be within 3\r\nfeet of the ground or as high as 20 feet or more above it, depending on\r\nthe height of the tree. Oftentimes they are very close together; I have\r\ncounted as many as six of them in the space of an inch and a half. The\r\nquestion has arisen whether the downy woodpecker ever makes these holes.\r\n\r\nWe know now, what the older ornithologists did not know, that it is a\r\nregular habit of the yellow-bellied sapsucker to drill such holes, but\r\nthere are plenty of statements in the ornithological literature today\r\nascribing the work to the downy woodpecker as well.\r\n\r\nDr. Charles W. Townsend (1932) gives an able summary of the literature\r\non this question and, after carefully weighing the evidence, comes\r\n“to the conclusion that these well known and characteristic circles\r\nof holes are made by true sapsuckers and not by downy or hairy\r\nwoodpeckers.”\r\n\r\nHe throws a good deal of doubt on some seemingly definite observations\r\nfrom correspondents quoted by Forbush in his “Birds of Massachusetts,”\r\nwhen he says that “many leave one in considerable uncertainty as to\r\nwhether the correspondents actually saw the downy woodpecker making the\r\nrings of holes, or merely tapping in the same region, or drinking the\r\nsap, or eating cambium from holes whose origin was not ascertained. It\r\nmay be that some of the correspondents were unable to distinguish the\r\ntrue species of woodpecker.”\r\n\r\nDr. Townsend cites several observations, two of which are quoted below.\r\nIf the first of these had not been correctly interpreted, and if the\r\nother had not been seen in its entirety, they might have led to error.\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n     There is one observation, however, which should be quoted\r\n     here, as it is of considerable interest in this discussion,\r\n     an observation made by a capable observer with great care.\r\n     Forbush says, _loc. cit._, vol. II, p. 268: “The first\r\n     trustworthy evidence, however, that I obtained regarding\r\n     the tapping of trees for sap by the Downy Woodpecker was\r\n     in 1899, when my assistant, the late Charles E. Bailey, on\r\n     April 6 watched one for several hours. His report reads:\r\n     ‘At 12:30 I found a Downy Woodpecker, and watched him till\r\n     2:45; he took three larvae from a maple stub, just under\r\n     the bark. He next tapped two small swamp maples, four and\r\n     six feet from the ground, and spent most of the time taking\r\n     sap. He tapped the tree by picking it a few times very\r\n     lightly; it looked like a slight cut, slanting a little.\r\n     The bird would sit and peck the sap out of the lower part\r\n     of the cut. The cut was so small the sap did not collect\r\n     very fast. The bird would go and sit for a long time in a\r\n     large tree and not move, then it would come back and take\r\n     more sap. It did this three times while I was watching it.\r\n     It did not care to take any food but the sap.’ * * * Mr.\r\n     Bailey cut off and brought me the limb, the bark of which\r\n     was perforated by the bird. * * * The perforations passed\r\n     through the bark to the wood, but did not enter it and\r\n     they do not in the least resemble in shape those made by\r\n     the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker.” Here is just what we should\r\n     expect in a woodpecker not specialized as a sapsucker. * * *\r\n\r\n     The next record is of considerable significance in this\r\n     discussion, and had I seen only the latter half of the\r\n     drama, my conclusions might have been different. In the\r\n     Wenham swamp on May 11, 1906, my notes state that Glover M.\r\n     Allen and I found a Yellow-bellied Sapsucker drilling holes\r\n     in a white pine. His movements were slow and he paid little\r\n     attention to us standing below him at the foot of the tree.\r\n     When he departed, a female Downy Woodpecker visited the\r\n     holes.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of his own observations, Dr. Townsend says: “I may state that,\r\nalthough I have long watched Downy Woodpeckers gleaning insects on\r\nand in the bark and wood of trees at all seasons of the year, I have\r\nnever seen them dig circles of holes in the bark. * * * I have never\r\nfound fresh rings of holes except during the time of the sapsucker\r\nmigrations.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The downy woodpecker is by no means a noisy bird; compared\r\nto the red-headed woodpecker, with its loud rattling calls, or to the\r\nshouting, boisterous flicker, it is quiet and demure. Nevertheless, we\r\ncannot be for long near one of these little birds, hidden high among\r\nleafy branches, before we learn of its presence. Within a few minutes,\r\nlong before we catch sight of it, we are almost certain to hear its\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nIts call note is a single abrupt syllable, like _tchick_. Although\r\nthis note is of sufficient volume to carry a considerable distance, it\r\nis not a loud note even when heard at short range. As in the case of\r\nmany bird notes, it is recognizable from the voice of any other bird\r\nhereabouts once we have become familiar with it, yet it is not easy to\r\nsay how it differs from numerous other calls that might be suggested by\r\nthe same letters. I believe one characteristic of the note that helps\r\nus distinguish it is its shortness--it is over almost as soon as begun,\r\nlike a dot in the telegraph code. But in spite of being sharp, it is a\r\nmodest little sound; it does not ring through the woods like the wild\r\ncall of the hairy woodpecker.\r\n\r\nAnother note is a long whinny made up of a dozen or more _tchicks_.\r\nThese increase in rapidity soon after the beginning of the series, and\r\nthe pitch drops rather sharply. Near the close, the volume diminishes,\r\nand the whinny ends with a “dying fall.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth Sampson (1934) brings this note very clearly to our mind when\r\nshe speaks of it as “a handful of his staccato notes * * * flung out in\r\na rapid run, gaining speed as they came, till they almost tumbled over\r\neach other at the end.”\r\n\r\nThis whinny is also given, although not often, without any fall in\r\npitch.\r\n\r\nThe downy woodpecker has other notes in its vocabulary, some of\r\nwhich are described under courtship, but, compared to the two noted\r\nabove, they are rarely heard. It may be that some of these notes are\r\nonly modifications of the call note, uttered with a slightly changed\r\ninflection. One, a single short note, has a distinct vocal quality.\r\n\r\nOf the young birds in the nest, Dr. Arthur A. Allen (1928) says that\r\nthey “keep up an incessant chippering, especially when they get the\r\nleast bit hungry, and at times they sound almost like a bee-hive, from\r\nthe ground.”\r\n\r\nAfter the young birds have left the nest, I have often heard them give\r\na series of _tchicks_ similar to the whinny of the adults, but in a\r\nweaker voice and _all on the same pitch_. However, this note evidently\r\nvaries, for Francis H. Allen says in his notes that the young have also\r\na rattle resembling the kingfisher rattle of _D. villosus_, but fainter\r\nand falling in pitch like the similar note of the adult.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The downy, the smallest of our woodpeckers, may be\r\nseparated at once from any other woodpecker, except the hairy, by the\r\nbroad white stripe down the back.\r\n\r\nThe hairy is half again as large as the downy, but in situations where\r\ncomparative size counts little, the downy may be recognized by its\r\nshort bill--no longer than its head. The hairy’s bill is longer even\r\nin proportion to the size of the bird.\r\n\r\n_Enemies._--Lewis O. Shelley, who as a bird bander has handled many\r\ndowny woodpeckers, says in his notes: “I find this species practically\r\nfree from parasites, but I have found among the feathers the two bird\r\nflies, _Ornithoica confluenta_ and _Ornithomyia anchineuria_.”\r\n\r\nAlexander Wilson (1832) shows that the house wren, although not an open\r\nenemy of the downy, causes it a good deal of annoyance by stealing its\r\nnest sometimes. He says:\r\n\r\n     The house wren, who also builds in the hollow of a tree,\r\n     but who is neither furnished with the necessary tools nor\r\n     strength for excavating such an apartment for himself,\r\n     allows the woodpeckers to go on, till he thinks it will\r\n     answer his purpose, then attacks them with violence, and\r\n     generally succeeds in driving them off. I saw some weeks\r\n     ago a striking example of this, where the woodpeckers we\r\n     are now describing, after commencing in a cherry-tree\r\n     within a few yards of the house, and having made\r\n     considerable progress, were turned out by the wren; the\r\n     former began again on a pear-tree in the garden, fifteen or\r\n     twenty yards off, whence, after digging out a most complete\r\n     apartment, and one egg being laid, they were once more\r\n     assaulted by the same impertinent intruder, and finally\r\n     forced to abandon the place.\r\n\r\nMaurice Thompson (1885) describes thus the bird’s defense against the\r\nattack of a goshawk:\r\n\r\n     I once saw a goshawk pursuing a downy woodpecker, when\r\n     the latter darted through a tuft of foliage and flattened\r\n     itself close upon the body of a thick oak bough, where\r\n     it remained as motionless as the bark itself. The hawk\r\n     alighted on the same bough within two feet of its intended\r\n     victim, and remained sitting there for some minutes,\r\n     evidently looking in vain for it, with nothing but thin air\r\n     between monster and morsel. The woodpecker was stretched\r\n     longitudinally on the bough, its tail and beak close to the\r\n     bark, its black and white speckled feathers looking like a\r\n     continuation of the wrinkles and lichen.\r\n\r\nMore commonly, when attacked by a hawk, the downy dodges behind a\r\nbranch and, if the hawk catch sight of it again, either winds round the\r\nbranch or dives behind another one. By this adroit defense the downy\r\nhas a fair chance of eluding the hawk’s attack.\r\n\r\n_Fall and winter._--We see little change in the behavior of the downy\r\nwoodpecker at the approach of autumn, at the time when many of the\r\nmigratory birds are beginning to show a daily increasing restlessness,\r\nseeming on tiptoe to start on their long journey, moving about actively\r\nin their new feathers, and breaking out sometimes with a phrase of\r\npostnuptial song. In the role of permanent resident, the downy remains\r\ncalm in the midst of the bustle of travel; it may join the hurrying\r\ngroups for a time, or become surrounded by them, but it does not catch\r\nthe contagion of departure, and soon drops behind to continue its local\r\nround.\r\n\r\nThe downy is not forced to seek the sun and warmth and the\r\ninexhaustible food of the Tropics, for the woodlands of New England and\r\nsoutheastern Canada are stored with food that, with a roosting hole,\r\nenables the bird to withstand the severest winter. But this food is\r\nlimited; the insects that have been multiplying all summer, thus adding\r\ncontinually to the woodpeckers’ supply of food, stop multiplying when\r\nthe frosts come, and will add no more until spring.\r\n\r\nThe downy is not a bird that ranges widely in search of food; moreover,\r\nfor protection against the weather it is held to the vicinity of its\r\nroosting hole. Therefore each bird, in order to be sure of sufficient\r\nfood for itself during the cold months, must maintain dominion over a\r\nterritory large enough to support it through the winter.\r\n\r\nThus it comes about that in autumn the downy _does_ perforce change its\r\nhabits, or rather its attitude toward other birds of its species. The\r\nfamilies disperse, and until the next breeding season each individual\r\nbecomes a solitary bird, living in a restricted region, which it\r\ndefends against trespass, resenting and repelling the approach of any\r\nother downy woodpecker.\r\n\r\nThis reversal of attitude or character--the change from a member of a\r\nfamily to an anchorite in fall, and back again in spring--takes place\r\ngradually, we may suppose, and not exactly at the same time in every\r\nbird. Hence one bird meeting another in autumn, while the change is\r\nin progress, may underestimate the degree to which it has drawn away\r\nfrom its fellows, or, in the spring, may overestimate the amount of\r\ncordiality that has returned to the wintering anchorite. This lack of\r\nunderstanding may give rise to behavior difficult or impossible for us\r\nto interpret.\r\n\r\nSometimes the relationship between two downies is clear enough, as\r\nwhen, on September 20, 1910, I saw a male fly repeatedly at a female\r\nin a menacing way and drive her off; and when on November 3, 1935, I\r\nsaw a female bird fly toward a male, which was perched near a hole in\r\nan electric-light pole, from which he did not retire, as a perched\r\nbird commonly does when approached by a bird on the wing, but held his\r\nground while she flew away; and when Lewis O. Shelley (MS.) tells of a\r\nfemale bird “rushing with antagonistic attitude at her two daughters”\r\nand also driving off her granddaughters whenever they invaded her\r\nwinter territory in autumn, all these birds being identified by bands.\r\n\r\nThere are cases, however, in which the relationship between the birds\r\nis very puzzling. In the following scene, from my notes, there is\r\na hint of hostility or remonstrance, but a suggestion of courtship\r\nalso--out of place, it seems, in autumn between two female birds.\r\n“October 15, 1935. Two birds are in a large, bare maple tree; one is\r\nnoticeably larger than the other, but neither one has a red occipital\r\npatch. They keep near each other, one following the other by short,\r\nquick flights. They perch perfectly motionless for a moment a foot or\r\ntwo apart; then both together sway their heads, swinging them quickly\r\ndown and up to one side, down and up to the other side. The swing is\r\nvery rapid, like the wink of an eye. They flit their wings upward and\r\noutward, also with the speed of a wink, over and over--all this without\r\na sound. They fly behind a branch sometimes but keep mostly in sight of\r\neach other, and, although neither attacks, each seems wary of attack\r\nand dodges away when approached. They sometimes alight on very slender\r\nbranches, and once a bird goes to the ground where it stands with its\r\nhead held high up. They move very actively and lightly, with never\r\nthe slightest blundering, flitting silently and easily from branch to\r\nbranch.”\r\n\r\nThe following astonishing story, taken from William Brewster’s Concord\r\njournal (1937), tells of a case in which antagonism of unknown cause\r\nleads to the killing with brutal violence of a female downy by a male:\r\n\r\n     March 20, 1911. We were in the dining-room, consulting\r\n     about the day’s work, when we heard the _tchick_ note of\r\n     the Downy Woodpecker repeated almost incessantly and very\r\n     rapidly just outside. For a moment or more we paid no\r\n     attention to it. But something unusual in its quality and\r\n     its insistence soon led me to look out and this was what I\r\n     saw:\r\n\r\n     On the snow, among the outermost stems of the lilacs on\r\n     one side of the dense thicket that they form was a female\r\n     Downy with extended and quivering wings. About her hopped\r\n     or rather danced a handsome male, showing the red on\r\n     his occiput very conspicuously. He kept striking at her\r\n     head with his bill and occasionally he held on for a few\r\n     seconds, when the two birds fluttered about together and\r\n     perhaps rolled over once or twice, closely united. At\r\n     first I thought it an amatory encounter and I am still\r\n     almost certain that the male attempted to secure sexual\r\n     contact with the female once or twice. But if so it could\r\n     not have been his primary or at least sole object. For he\r\n     continued to peck her head even when she was lying almost\r\n     motionless on the snow. For a time she seemed to be trying\r\n     to escape and for fully two minutes her cries were piteous\r\n     and incessant. At length he left her and flew up into an\r\n     elm where he clung for a moment or two, making what seemed\r\n     to me a very unusual display of the red on his occiput.\r\n     Then of a sudden he swooped down on the female, who had\r\n     meanwhile been cowering in the middle of a cluster of\r\n     lilac stems, on the snow. Dragging her forth from this\r\n     slight shelter into an open space, he attacked her again,\r\n     this time with obvious fury, fairly raining a shower of\r\n     blows on the back of her head. She seemed too weak to make\r\n     any further attempt to escape and her cries, although\r\n     continued, were so faint that we could only just hear them.\r\n     I now realized for the first time that he was inspired by\r\n     the _lust of killing_ and not by sexual ardor. It was very\r\n     hard to refrain from rushing out and driving him away but\r\n     I restrained the impulse, not being willing to interrupt\r\n     a tragedy of such extraordinary, if repulsive, interest.\r\n     It would have made no difference anyway, for, this final\r\n     onslaught lasted only a very few seconds. During its\r\n     continuance the male Downy seemed literally beside himself\r\n     with rage. No Butcher Bird that I have ever watched\r\n     has shown, while dealing with a Mouse or Sparrow, more\r\n     murderous energy. After finishing the foul deed he left the\r\n     female lying perfectly motionless and flew up again into\r\n     the elm. We now went out and picked up the female. She was\r\n     still living but unable to move. The [back] of her head was\r\n     soaked in blood and her bare skull showed in places. She\r\n     died a little later. I skinned her and preserved her skull\r\n     which I have attached to the skin. It is _punctured in 10\r\n     or 12 places_. The bird was in normal condition physically\r\n     with healthy-looking ovary the ovules undeveloped. The only\r\n     injuries were to the skull.\r\n\r\nDoubtless a few downy woodpeckers move southward in autumn or early\r\nin winter, especially from the northern part of the bird’s range.\r\nDr. Charles W. Townsend in his Ipswich notes (MS.) says that he sees\r\n“evident migrants not uncommonly in October and November.” But most\r\nof our birds spend the whole year round with us, and in autumn we may\r\nwatch them as they make provision for winter. Even before the leaves\r\nare off the trees--in September here in New England--we may hear, day\r\nafter day as we pass a certain tree, the tapping of a downy woodpecker\r\nwhere, invisible from the ground, high up on a branch, it is digging\r\nout a cavity, its roosting hole, in which it will sleep alone through\r\nthe long winter nights, and into which it may retreat in the daytime\r\nwhenever “the frost-wind blows.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                DRYOBATES PUBESCENS NELSONI Oberholser\r\n\r\n                       NELSON’S DOWNY WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThis large race of the downy woodpecker inhabits the wooded regions\r\nof northern Alaska and northern Canada, intergrading with _Dryobates\r\npubescens medianus_ in southern Canada and possibly in northern New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nDr. H. C. Oberholser (1896a), in describing and naming it,\r\ncharacterizes it as “similar to _Dryobates pubescens_ [=_medianus_],\r\nbut averaging larger; the under parts pure white instead of brownish;\r\nthe lower tail-coverts and outer tail-feathers averaging with much less\r\nof black markings; red nuchal band of male averaging somewhat wider.”\r\n\r\nSwainson and Richardson (1831) say: “This diminutive but exceedingly\r\nindustrious Woodpecker is a constant inhabitant of the fur-countries\r\nup to the fifty-eighth parallel. It seeks its food principally on the\r\nmaple, elm, and ash, and, north of latitude 54°, where these trees\r\nterminate, on the aspen and birch. Its researches are made mostly, if\r\nnot wholly, on live trees.”\r\n\r\nDr. E. W. Nelson (1887) writes:\r\n\r\n     Throughout the Territory [Alaska] where woodland or a\r\n     growth of bushes and small trees occurs the present bird is\r\n     certain to be found, and is a resident winter and summer.\r\n     It has been taken along the entire course of the Yukon as\r\n     well as at various points on the coast of Bering Sea, and\r\n     thence south at Kadiak and Sitka. In autumn it is a rather\r\n     common visitant to the coast of Norton Sound in spite of\r\n     the lack of timber, and it was not uncommon to see it\r\n     clinging to the sides of the houses, or to the flagstaff,\r\n     and other similar supports; after resting awhile, and,\r\n     perhaps, tapping a few times on the unproductive logs, they\r\n     would leave for a more promising field. They were seen\r\n     at times passing from one alder patch to another, on the\r\n     hill-sides, and they follow the spruces and other trees to\r\n     the shore of the sea.\r\n\r\n     While I was camping in spring, at the Yukon mouth, these\r\n     birds were rather common in the dense bushes along this\r\n     stream and its tributaries. Their holes were frequently\r\n     found in the decaying stubs, although I did not find a nest\r\n     containing eggs. This species appears to frequent deciduous\r\n     thickets and trees by preference, as, in addition to the\r\n     various times which I saw it in the interior in winter,\r\n     while at the Yukon mouth, I always found it about locations\r\n     where only deciduous trees and bushes were found, and its\r\n     holes were always made in cottonwood or birch-stubs.\r\n\r\nJudged from what little is known about them, the nesting, food, and\r\nother habits of Nelson’s downy woodpecker do not differ materially\r\nfrom those of its more southern relatives, except as influenced by its\r\ndifferent environment. Living in the far north, where trees are small\r\nand scarce, it has to be content to excavate its nest in small trees\r\nor low stumps. There are very few eggs in collections; a set of five\r\neggs in the Thayer collection was taken from a hole 4 feet from the\r\nground in a rotten stump, near Fort Saskatchewan, Canada, on June 10,\r\n1898. These eggs are like other eggs of the species, pure white, ovate\r\nin shape, and somewhat glossy. The measurements of 31 eggs average\r\n19.54 by 15.43 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure\r\n=21.9= by 16.1, 19.4 by =16.4=, =17.5= by 15.0, and 18.65 by =14.28=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 DRYOBATES PUBESCENS TURATI (Malherbe)\r\n\r\n                           WILLOW WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe downy woodpeckers of California were for many years all called\r\n_D. p. gairdneri_, until Dr. Walter K. Fisher (1902) called attention\r\nto the smaller and lighter-colored race, which inhabits much of the\r\ncoast region and nearly all the lowlands of southern California. For\r\nthis race, he very properly revived Malherbe’s name, as given above,\r\nfor this name was based on birds taken near Monterey. He gives as the\r\ncharacters of the willow woodpecker:\r\n\r\n     Smaller than _Dryobates pubescens gairdneri_, with smaller\r\n     feet; under parts lighter; the elongated superciliary patch\r\n     and rictal stripe extending over sides of neck, pure white,\r\n     instead of smoky white of _gairdneri_; tertials always more\r\n     or less spotted with white. * * *\r\n\r\n     _Dryobates pubescens turati_ is a southern representative\r\n     of _gairdneri_, which it resembles in the smoky under parts\r\n     and restricted areas of white on the wings, and from which\r\n     it differs in its smaller size, much smaller feet, and\r\n     clearer white markings of head. The present form is near\r\n     true _pubescens_ of the Southern States, but differs from\r\n     it in having much less white on the wings, the coverts\r\n     and tertials of _pubescens_ being conspicuously and often\r\n     heavily marked with white. * * *\r\n\r\n     The willow woodpecker in a typical form breeds from Los\r\n     Angeles and San Bernardino counties north in the coast\r\n     ranges to San Francisco Bay, and along the west slope of\r\n     the Sierra Nevada at least to Yuba County. Intergradation\r\n     with _gairdneri_ occurs over the coast region north of\r\n     San Francisco Bay and in the mountains at the head of the\r\n     Sacramento Valley.\r\n\r\nGrinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale (1930) say of the haunts of the willow\r\nwoodpecker in the Lassen Peak region: “Downy woodpeckers were seen most\r\noften close to streams and in orchards. Their forage places included\r\nthe limbs or small trunks of willow, alder, cottonwood, sycamore,\r\nvalley oak, blue oak, digger pine, and yellow pine trees.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Major Bendire (1895) writes: “Mr. Charles A. Allen informs\r\nme that it breeds in the oaks and willows along the Sacramento River,\r\nCalif., but that it is not common. Its breeding sites seem to be\r\nconfined to deciduous trees, preferably dead ones, or old stumps,\r\nand besides those already mentioned, sycamore and cottonwoods are\r\noccasionally used. Their nesting sites are rarely found at any great\r\ndistance from the ground, usually ranging from 4 to 20 feet up and\r\nrarely higher.”\r\n\r\nW. L. Dawson (1923) says: “Willow woodpeckers, in the wild, place\r\ntheir nests at considerable heights in deciduous trees, and those, if\r\npossible, among thick growths on moist ground. Both sexes assist in\r\nexcavation, as in incubation. Partially decayed wood is selected, and\r\nan opening made about an inch and a quarter in diameter. After driving\r\nstraight in for an inch or two, the passage turns down and widens two\r\nor three diameters. At the depth of a foot or so the crystal white eggs\r\nare deposited on a neat bed of fine chips. Incubation lasts twelve\r\ndays, and the young are hatched some time in May.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The willow woodpecker lays three to six eggs, more commonly\r\nfour or five; it may occasionally lay seven, as some of the other\r\nwestern races have been known to do. The eggs are typical of\r\nthe species. The measurements of 40 eggs average 18.74 by 15.20\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =22.3= by 15.7,\r\n18.4 by =16.3=, =17.3= by 14.5, and 18.0 by =14.4= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Mr. Dawson (1923) writes:\r\n\r\n     It is as an orchardist that the Willow Woodpecker deserves\r\n     the most careful consideration. Bird-lovers are, perhaps\r\n     prone to superlatives in commending their friends, but\r\n     it is safe to say that a more useful bird _for his\r\n     ounces_ than the downy woodpecker does not exist. He eats\r\n     not only ants and the larvae of wood-boring beetles,\r\n     but scale insects, plant lice, and the pupae of the\r\n     detestable coddling moth. The evidence is clear that these\r\n     incomparable tree experts, together with their friends, the\r\n     nuthatches, the chickadees, and the creepers, would insure\r\n     the health of our orchards if they were numerous enough.\r\n     It becomes of the highest importance, then, to study their\r\n     welfare in turn. In the northern and more elevated valleys\r\n     of the State, it may be worth while to offer them nuts or\r\n     to hang out a bit of suet in winter. In the South no such\r\n     precautions are necessary. A fundamental consideration,\r\n     however, is the provision of suitable nesting sites.\r\n     Experiment has shown that the downy’s forage range during\r\n     the breeding season is not extensive. The clamoring young\r\n     are fed by the product of nearby trees (fed, it may be, a\r\n     thousand insects a day). Their services, therefore, must be\r\n     secured in the orchard; and to this end the orchardist must\r\n     consent to leave certain dead branches--a foot or so at the\r\n     base of the larger ones will do--for a nesting site. Dead\r\n     wood, of course, invites insects; but the most serious and\r\n     frequent mistake which our California orchardists make is\r\n     to trim out all the dead wood from the fruit trees. A pair\r\n     of Willow Woodpeckers, or of Slender-billed Nuthatches,\r\n     will clean out all the dangerous pests from a dead tree,\r\n     and sixteen live ones to boot.\r\n\r\nGrinnell and Storer (1924) made some studies of the feeding habits of\r\nthe willow woodpecker in the Yosemite region, of which they say:\r\n\r\n     A pair of Willow Woodpeckers proved to be regular tenants\r\n     of Curry’s apple orchard on the floor of the Yosemite\r\n     Valley. They, or their ancestors, had evidently worked\r\n     there for some years, with the result that most of the\r\n     150 trees in the orchard showed marks of their attention,\r\n     and many of the trunks were fairly riddled with drillings\r\n     somewhat like those of the sapsucker. * * *\r\n\r\n     However destructive this drilling may seem to be, it does\r\n     not seriously affect the vitality of the trees; the pits\r\n     are but 4 to 5 mm. deep, penetrating only those outer\r\n     layers of the bark which after a time scale off. We should\r\n     judge that all evidence of this woodpecker’s work is thus\r\n     removed through natural process within about three years.\r\n     The heartwood of the tree therefore seems not to be damaged\r\n     at all by the woodpecker’s work; it _is_ damaged, however,\r\n     by the work of the true sapsucker. Our inference from\r\n     these facts is that the willow woodpecker feeds on the\r\n     inner layers of bark, which the bird exposes through the\r\n     perforations described above. We watched a bird at work;\r\n     moreover, bits of inner bark-fibers were found adhering to\r\n     the bristles around the bill of a bird shot.\r\n\r\nEvidently this observation and report started the same old controversy\r\nthat arose in connection with the eastern bird, which has been referred\r\nto under that subspecies. Charles W. Michael intimated, in course of\r\nconversation with Dr. Grinnell, that they were mistaken in ascribing\r\nthese drillings to willow woodpeckers rather than to red-breasted\r\nsapsuckers. This led to the publication, by Dr. Grinnell (1928a), of\r\nthe evidence produced by Mr. Michael and himself, to which the reader\r\nis referred. In spite of some evidence, and more supposed evidence,\r\nto the contrary, it now seems to be generally conceded that the downy\r\nwoodpeckers seldom, if ever, drill these holes for themselves, but that\r\nthey often feed from holes drilled by sapsuckers. The small amount of\r\ndrilling done by the downy woodpeckers seems to do the trees no great\r\nharm.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Grinnell and Storer (1924) write:\r\n\r\n     The quietness of the willow woodpecker, as compared with\r\n     most other species in its family, is noteworthy. We heard\r\n     no single call note from it, and only at long intervals\r\n     did we hear the indescribable short trill characteristic\r\n     of this bird. Individuals are much restricted in range,\r\n     foraging along a relatively short line of cottonwoods or\r\n     willows day after day. Once a bird is located, it can\r\n     usually be found in the same place regularly. When foraging\r\n     it moves about with very little commotion, and even when\r\n     drilling for insects works so quietly that only a keen\r\n     auditor can detect its presence. No matter what the season\r\n     of the year, a pair of these birds is to be found usually\r\n     within hearing of each other. The bird’s close adherence\r\n     to deciduous trees makes it more conspicuous and easier to\r\n     observe in late fall and winter than in the summertime when\r\n     the trees are fully leaved out; but even in winter, our\r\n     experience with the willow woodpecker led us to consider\r\n     it about the most elusive of all the diurnal birds of the\r\n     Yosemite region.\r\n\r\n     We had always supposed that the rapid series of notes\r\n     uttered by this species were given only by the adult male\r\n     and hence constituted a sort of song. But on June 24, 1920,\r\n     in Yosemite Valley a juvenile male was found, with his head\r\n     out of a nest hole eight feet above the ground in a dead\r\n     branch of a live willow, giving every few moments this very\r\n     series of notes. The large _crown_ patch of red on this\r\n     bird established its age and sex clearly. There was every\r\n     indication that the notes were being given as a food call.\r\n\r\nM. P. Skinner contributes the following note:\r\n\r\n     One seen in Sequoia National Park in August was drilling\r\n     at the bases of willow shoots near a river. It perched\r\n     lengthwise of the stems. It managed to keep well hidden,\r\n     but worked industriously and did not change its position\r\n     much during the short time that I could see it. Later,\r\n     I caught a glimpse occasionally of the woodpecker’s red\r\n     head, although the bird kept hidden most of the time. This\r\n     reminded me that I had often wondered why red usually\r\n     marked a woodpecker’s head. Certainly it makes a wonderful\r\n     recognition mark. In that way it might well be that red on\r\n     the constantly moving head of the woodpecker would be of\r\n     value to the race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     DRYOBATES BOREALIS (Vieillot)\r\n\r\n                        RED-COCKADED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                             PLATES 9, 10\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\n                 CONTRIBUTED BY EUGENE EDMOND MURPHEY\r\n\r\nIntroduced to ornithology by Wilson under the name of _Picus querulus_,\r\nthe red-cockaded woodpecker is locally common throughout the open\r\npine country of the South Atlantic and Gulf States and extends its\r\nrange into the pine country of Oklahoma and Missouri. Its preference\r\nis very definitely for the open woods, shunning the dense thickets\r\nof second-growth pine and the deep recesses of the cypress swamps\r\neven when the latter are only a few hundred yards away from its\r\nchosen environment. These open pine woods, which abound both in the\r\nAustro-Riparian and Carolinian Zones of the South Atlantic and Gulf\r\nStates, represent not a normal growth of pine forest but an original\r\npine forest modified by the pernicious custom of annually burning the\r\nwoods under the impression that in that way next year’s pasturage will\r\nbe improved.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the younger trees and seedlings are killed off. Only the\r\nhardier and more resistant survivors remain, so that there is little or\r\nno underbrush and the general appearance of these woods is more that\r\nof an open glade or park than of typical pine forest. William Brewster\r\n(1882) comments on the character of these forests as follows: “The pine\r\nlands of the South have an open park-like character that is a continual\r\nsurprise to one accustomed only to New England forests. The trees\r\nrarely stand in close proximity to one another, and they are often so\r\nwidely scattered that the general effect is that of an opening rather\r\nthan a forest.” These pines are chiefly _Pinus palustris_ Miller,\r\n_Pinus ellioti_ Engelmann, and _Pinus taeda_ Linnaeus.\r\n\r\nFrom many sections of the South where it was formerly common, the\r\nred-cockaded woodpecker has disappeared by reason of the ruthless\r\ndestruction of pine forests by the lumbermen. When the large timber is\r\ncut out, the birds leave the locality and apparently do not return.\r\nHowever, there is still a considerable amount of pine forest suitable\r\nfor its nesting that is held in private hands and not about to be\r\ndestroyed. In fact, such timber holdings are largely on the increase,\r\nparticularly in the “low country” of South Carolina and Georgia and\r\nin certain zones around Thomasville, Ga., and Aiken, S. C., where vast\r\ntracts are being conserved by private ownership as game refuges and\r\nshooting preserves.\r\n\r\nThere is also a very considerable amount of intelligent reforestation\r\nbeing carried out, which in time will also furnish adequate and\r\nsuitable breeding grounds. This species is so highly specialized at\r\nleast in the South Atlantic States in its habits and its choice of\r\nenvironment that the destruction of the pine forests would probably put\r\nits existence in serious jeopardy.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Audubon (1842) stated that “the nest is not unfrequently\r\nbored in a decayed stump about thirty feet high.” G. W. Morse (1927)\r\nfound the bird nesting in a willow tree in a pasture in Oklahoma. M.\r\nG. Vaiden (MS.) reports from Collins, Miss., the taking of a nest\r\nfrom a pine tree, the top of which was dead and the nest hole about 8\r\nfeet from the top. Arthur T. Wayne (1906), who has probably had more\r\nintimate experience with this bird than any other observer, states:\r\n\r\n     I have seen perhaps a thousand holes in which this\r\n     woodpecker had bred or was breeding, and _every one_ was\r\n     excavated in a _living_ pine tree, ranging from eighteen\r\n     to one hundred feet above the ground. This bird never lays\r\n     its eggs until the pine gum pours freely from beneath and\r\n     around the hole, and in order to accelerate the flow the\r\n     birds puncture the bark to the “skin” of the tree thereby\r\n     causing the gum to exude freely. This species, unlike the\r\n     Pileated Woodpecker, returns to the same hole year after\r\n     year until it can no longer make the gum exude. But like\r\n     the Pileated Woodpecker, it is much attached to the tree\r\n     in which it has first made its nest, and as long as it can\r\n     find a suitable spot it will continue to excavate new holes\r\n     until the tree is _killed_ by this process of boring. I\r\n     have frequently counted as many as four holes in one tree,\r\n     and in two instances I have seen as many as eight. These\r\n     birds seem to know by instinct that the center of the tree\r\n     is rotten, or what lumber men call “black-heart,” and they\r\n     never make a mistake when selecting a tree! The hole is\r\n     bored through the solid wood, generally a little upward,\r\n     and to the center of the tree (which is always rotten).\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of observers who have studied the\r\nred-cockaded woodpecker in its normal habitat concur in the opinion\r\nthat the site of selection for the nest hole is in a living pine that,\r\nhowever, has begun to rot at the core, and this condition of the\r\nheart of the tree the birds seem to be able to discern with unfailing\r\naccuracy. All the nests I have seen and studied were in living pines,\r\nand other ornithologists have made similar observations. T. Gilbert\r\nPearson (1909) says: “So far as I have observed, always excavated\r\nin the trunk of a living pine tree. The site chosen varies from\r\ntwenty-five to fifty feet from the earth.” H. L. Harllee (MS.), of\r\nFlorence, S. C, writes: “It nests in the same hole each year in close\r\nproximity to several pairs, usually from two to four.” The observations\r\nof Gilbert R. Rossignol (MS.), writing from Savannah, Ga., agree with\r\nthe foregoing. He states: “Before the lumberman invaded our great pine\r\nforests, the red-cockaded was fairly common, for I have found 10 or 12\r\npairs nesting in a 50-acre tract, provided, of course, that the pine\r\ntrees were not too close to one another. These little woodpeckers did\r\nnot like dark heavily timbered forests. The bird drills a hole in a\r\nliving pine ranging from 25 to 80 or more feet high, and it is almost\r\nimpossible to get the eggs without full equipment. It takes a brace\r\nand bit to bore holes a little above where you think the bottom of the\r\nnest is located, and then sometimes you strike below it, or again right\r\ninto it on an incomplete set or no eggs at all. The eggs I have found\r\nwere always more or less sticky with pine gum. This bird will nest in\r\nthe same hole for several years and use the same tree probably during\r\nits entire life, but if the tree dies, or the gum does not flow freely,\r\nthe birds will desert their old home.” Henry Nehrling (1882), writing\r\nfrom Texas, states that “it usually excavates its nesting sites in\r\ndeciduous trees,” and E. A. McIlhenny (Bendire, 1895) that “in southern\r\nLouisiana it generally nests in willow and china trees.” The nesting\r\nhole is bored usually slightly upward for several inches then straight\r\nthrough into the softer unsound heart of the tree and downward for 8\r\ninches to a foot or more. The nest cavity is gourd-shaped, and the\r\neggs are laid upon fine chips and debris in the bottom of the cavity.\r\nThe most striking thing about the nesting site, however, is due to the\r\nbird’s custom of drilling numerous small holes through the bark of the\r\ntree until the resin exudes freely. This glazed patch of gum around\r\nthe nesting hole is unmistakable and when once seen becomes an easy\r\nlandmark for the location of the nests, inasmuch as it may be discerned\r\nthrough the open woods for a distance of several hundred yards. During\r\nthe period of incubation, the birds are a sorry spectacle, the abdomen\r\nbeing largely denuded of feathers, as is customary with many birds,\r\nand the breast feathers from the clavicle to the end of the sternum\r\nbegaumed and matted together with resin, and, in fact, they remain\r\npermanently unfit to be taken as specimens until the next molting has\r\nbeen completed.\r\n\r\nThe nidification is earlier along the coast and southward than in\r\nthe interior and toward the northern limits of its range, beginning\r\nsometimes as early as February, but the major nesting season may be\r\nsaid to be the last week in April and the first week in May.\r\n\r\nS. A. Grimes tells us that old nests of this species are used by\r\nred-bellied and red-headed woodpeckers, white-breasted nuthatches,\r\nbluebirds, crested flycatchers, and flying squirrels.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The eggs vary from three to five in number, the latter being\r\nunusual; they are elliptically ovate in shape, pure glossy white,\r\nand semitranslucent when fresh. Not infrequently they are stained or\r\nsmeared with resin from the breast feathers of the incubating bird. As\r\na rule only one brood is raised in a season unless the first set has\r\nbeen taken, and both parents participate in incubation. There is some\r\nevidence tending to show that the eggs and even the unfledged young\r\nare sometimes thrown out of the nest by the birds when it has been\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of 50 eggs average 24.04 by 17.86 millimeters; the\r\neggs showing the four extremes measure =26.42= by 18.54, 26.4 by\r\n=19.8=, =21.38= by 17.46, and 23.77 by =16.66= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The young in their first plumage bear the general color\r\npattern of the adults with this important exception--the young male has\r\na dull crimson oval central crown patch. However, while the pattern is\r\nidentical with that of adult birds, the black is replaced by a dark\r\nsepia merging at times into an aniline black, and the bluish gloss\r\nevident on the crowns of the mature birds is lacking. Similarly, the\r\nfeathers of the cheek patch in both sexes lack the fine silky gloss and\r\ntexture that are later attained. The underparts show uniformly a buffy\r\nor ochraceous wash everywhere, and the barring of the tail is more\r\npronounced. During this phase, the plumage is much softer and looser\r\nthan it subsequently becomes.\r\n\r\nWith the first molt, the red crown patch is lost.\r\n\r\nIt is the belief of the writer, without sufficient specimens properly\r\nto verify it, that the cockades of the full adult male plumage are not\r\nattained until at least the third molt. Without careful dissection\r\nand sex determination of the immature birds, a fact notoriously\r\ndifficult to the average ornithologist, the young of both sexes, after\r\nthe crown patch is lost and the cockades have not appeared, would be\r\nindistinguishable.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The food, like that of most woodpeckers, consists primarily of\r\nlarvae of various wood-boring insects, although beetles and grubs of\r\nother kinds as well as ants, grasshoppers, crickets, and caterpillars\r\nare frequently taken. An interesting habit of the red-cockaded\r\nwoodpecker is that of going into the cornfields throughout the South\r\nat the time when the corn is at the roasting-ear stage and when many\r\nof the ears are infested with a worm that damages the grain to a very\r\nconsiderable extent. This habit is reported by Billy Ward (1930), of\r\nTimmonsville, S. C., and by Edward Dingle (1926), of Mount Pleasant, S.\r\nC., who says, “The Red-cockaded Woodpecker (_Phrenopicus borealis_) is\r\nvery commonly found in cornfields during the time the corn is in the\r\near; in fact, the bird spends a large part of its time at this season\r\nin extracting the worms that bore into the ears of corn. I have often,\r\nat short distance, watched them engaged in this valuable work.” They\r\nalso feed on pine mast, the small wild grape, pokeberries, and other\r\nsmall wild fruit. I have never seen them in orchards or in fig trees,\r\nwhere the red-headed woodpecker is frequently found feeding.\r\n\r\nAs far as is known, this species does not visit cultivated fields,\r\nexcept as above referred to, or orchards and is not destructive to\r\nfruit and deserves to be regarded as wholly beneficial. This statement\r\ntakes into account the fact that a number of observers say that they\r\nwill continue to bore into certain pines that they have selected for a\r\nnesting site until the tree is killed. The fact is, however, that the\r\ntree is diseased and unsound before the woodpecker begins to utilize it\r\nand is already worthless for lumber, so that this species seems worthy\r\nof complete protection.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The bird is strikingly gregarious as compared with other\r\nwoodpeckers and is ordinarily to be found in small groups of six,\r\neight, or even ten individuals, which seem to keep in continuous touch\r\nwith one another, calling back and forth, sounding their drum roll on\r\nresonant timber and apparently not satisfied unless assured of the near\r\npresence of the group.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is no doubt due to the fact that the family remains\r\ntogether until early in winter, although family groups are probably\r\njoined by other individuals until the number above referred to is\r\nattained. Numerous observers speak of the frequent association of the\r\nred-cockaded woodpecker with other birds. This to the mind of the\r\nwriter, however, is purely accidental and is due to the fact that\r\nthere are certain species of birds that inhabit the open pineries and\r\nhave common feeding ground and habitat. It is true that one often sees\r\nbluebirds, tufted titmice, white-breasted and brown-headed nuthatches,\r\nand red-cockaded woodpeckers in the same woodland and that when\r\nsitting quietly and concealed all the species mentioned pass in review\r\nbefore the observer, but probably it is not a true gregariousness that\r\nembraces all these various species; rather the restlessness that so\r\nfrequently seems to possess the avian population of a given tract of\r\nwoods communicates itself from one to the other and the entire avifauna\r\nof a limited patch of woodland begins to move in a certain direction\r\nperhaps because of some alarm which has been communicated from one\r\nmember of the group to the others.\r\n\r\nThese woodpeckers are exceedingly active, galloping from one tree to\r\nanother and rapidly ascending it in quest of food or apparently often\r\nmerely to secure a better observation point somewhere near the top of\r\nthe tree. Their usual custom is to ascend the tree in spirals, although\r\nthey have frequently been observed to continue a straight course up\r\nthe trunk particularly when feeding. The bird may be described as wary\r\nrather than shy and is most adept at the familiar woodpecker trick\r\nof keeping the trunk of the tree between an approaching observer and\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAs a rule they do not feed close to the ground, nor have I ever\r\nobserved one on the ground even after the burning of a woodland, at\r\nwhich time the flicker and the red-bellied woodpecker may both be\r\nobserved on the ground searching for grubs and insects killed by\r\nthe blaze. Dr. Irving Phinizy (MS.) states that he has on several\r\noccasions observed the red-cockaded woodpecker descend a tree in a\r\nseries of backward hops. This the writer has never observed. Arthur H.\r\nHowell (1932) states that the ivorybill inches backward down a tree,\r\na somewhat different procedure. Frequently also they are observed,\r\nparticularly when feeding near the top of a pine and out toward the end\r\nof a limb, to descend the hanging limb nuthatch fashion. Much of their\r\nfeeding is done in the highest branches of the trees, and they seem\r\nto have a predilection for remaining there, spending a considerable\r\nportion of their time in the very crown of the tree, where they are\r\nvery difficult to see.\r\n\r\nThey are exceedingly quarrelsome, particularly during the breeding\r\nseason, yet their quarrels do not seem to be so serious or so prolonged\r\nas those of the red-headed woodpecker; and not infrequently, after the\r\nlapse of a very little time, birds that have been scolding one another\r\nmost extensively again alight on the same pine tree and go about their\r\nrespective businesses in perfect amity.\r\n\r\nC. J. Maynard (1896) states, concerning its habits, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Wilson called the Cockaded Woodpeckers, _Picus querulus_,\r\n     and this seems, at first glance, to be a most appropriate\r\n     name, for, of all the family, these are not only the most\r\n     noisy, but their notes are given in a decidedly fretful\r\n     tone as if the birds were constantly in an irritable state\r\n     of mind. It must have been upon the impulse of the moment,\r\n     however, that the Pioneer Ornithologist gave them the\r\n     name of Querulus Woodpeckers, for a close study of their\r\n     habits gives a very different impression of them. They\r\n     are, in fact, a most jovial class of birds, being almost\r\n     constantly engaged in sporting about the tops of tall pines\r\n     or chasing one another from tree to tree, uttering their\r\n     peevish sounding notes very frequently when in the best\r\n     humor. The noise is more noticeable because they congregate\r\n     in flocks, and it is quite rare to find even a pair without\r\n     other companions. They are also fond of the company of\r\n     other members of the family and will even associate with\r\n     the Jays, Blue Birds, or Warblers. This gregarious instinct\r\n     does not forsake them during the breeding season, for\r\n     they build in detached communities. The nests are almost\r\n     always in living pines, often thirty or forty feet from the\r\n     ground; thus, as the trunks of these trees are covered with\r\n     a smooth bark, it is quite difficult to climb them and,\r\n     when the nests are reached it is not easy to cut the hard\r\n     wood, especially as the straight trunks afford no foot-hold.\r\n\r\n     In flight, the cockaded woodpeckers resemble the downy\r\n     but when they alight they strike the object upon which\r\n     they wish to rest very hard. Like the preceding species,\r\n     they are also exceedingly agile, moving spirally up the\r\n     tall tree trunks with great celerity. Although they will\r\n     occasionally alight near the ground, yet they spend the\r\n     greater part of their time in the tops of the lofty pines;\r\n     in fact, they pass a large portion of their lives there,\r\n     for they are seldom, if ever, found elsewhere than in the\r\n     piney woods and they inhabit this kind of woodland even to\r\n     the extreme southern portion of the main-land of Florida.\r\n\r\nThe bird is resident throughout its normal range, although David V.\r\nHembree, of Roswell, Ga., in the very foothills of the Appalachian\r\nRange, a lifelong student and collector of birds, writes me, “This\r\nbird does not breed in this locality. I have never seen a nest. A few\r\nare found here, nearly always males in April or May, and I have always\r\nthought them to be migrants or strays from their regular range.”\r\n\r\nIn common with the other small black and white woodpeckers, this\r\nspecies carries the vernacular name of sapsucker and in the main is\r\nnot differentiated from the others, although one astute lumberman once\r\nsaid to me: “Speaking of sapsuckers, there _is_ a piney-woods sapsucker\r\nwhich is different from the others, leastways he acts different.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The voice is variously described by different observers--\r\n“harsh and discordant,” “almost exactly resembling the calls of the\r\nBrownheaded Nuthatch,” “resembling the yank-yank of a White-breasted\r\nNuthatch,” “they have sharp calls more like loud sparrow alarms than\r\nwoodpecker notes,” “resembling the querulous cries of young birds.”\r\n\r\nThe bird is noisy, and its call notes and scolding notes are to the ear\r\nof the writer quite radically different, the scolding note being more\r\nprolonged, somewhat rolling in character and lower in pitch. There is\r\na definite nasal character to a note that to that extent does resemble\r\nthe notes of the nuthatch. The note is quite characteristic and when\r\nonce learned is distinguishable with ease from that of the other small\r\nwoodpeckers. It resembles more the high note of some small woodwind\r\ninstrument than anything else, having a definite clarinetlike quality.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of bird notes are notoriously variable because of\r\nthe variability of the human ear, and many attempts at phonetic\r\nreproduction of the bird notes are unsuccessful, and when, as is so\r\noften done, the attempt is directed to reproduction in syllables, the\r\nresult is usually a futile and meaningless onomatopoeia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Southeastern United States; nonmigratory.\r\n\r\nThe range of the red-cockaded woodpecker extends =north= to\r\nnortheastern Oklahoma (Copan); southern Missouri (Shannon County);\r\nTennessee (Beersheba and Allardt); and North Carolina (Red Springs and\r\nBeaufort). =East= on the Atlantic coast from North Carolina (Beaufort)\r\nto southern Florida (Long Pine Key). =South= on the Gulf coast from the\r\nFlorida Keys (Long Pine Key) to southeastern Texas (Houston). =West= to\r\nTexas (Houston); northwestern Louisiana (Mansfield); probably western\r\nArkansas (Mena); and eastern Oklahoma (Tulsa and Copan).\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--It seems probable that this species may breed or\r\nupon occasion has bred in the vicinity of Raleigh, N. C., as it was\r\nnoted there several times in April from 1890 to 1898. It also has\r\nbeen reported as seen at Piney Creek, N. C., on July 6, 1932, and on\r\nSeptember 12, 1933.\r\n\r\nA specimen in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia was\r\ncollected near that city in 1861; one in the collection of the Ohio\r\nState University was taken near Columbus, Ohio, on March 15, 1872.\r\nAccording to Stone (1909) the collection of George N. Lawrence\r\ncontained a specimen taken near Hoboken, N. J.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--Florida: 30 records, April 3 to May 28; 15 records,\r\n    April 29 to May 20, indicating the height of the season.\r\n  South Carolina: 14 records, April 27 to May 28.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               DRYOBATES SCALARIS SYMPLECTUS Oberholser\r\n\r\n                           TEXAS WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThis is the subspecies that was formerly known as Baird’s woodpecker,\r\n_Dryobates scalaris bairdi_, which was then understood to be the\r\nresident bird of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. But when Dr. H. C.\r\nOberholser (1911b) revised the _scalaris_ group, the name _bairdi_\r\nwas restricted to the bird of central Mexico, and the Texas bird\r\nwas described, as a new subspecies, under the above name. It was\r\ncharacterized as follows:\r\n\r\n     Resembling _Dryobates scalaris cactophilus_, but male\r\n     smaller; upper parts lighter, the white bars wider, the\r\n     black bars narrower, and with more white on pileum; and\r\n     sides of breast less often _streaked_ (mostly spotted). * * *\r\n\r\n     This new subspecies differs from _Dryobates scalaris\r\n     bairdi_, from Hidalgo, much as does _Dryobates scalaris\r\n     cactophilus_, except that it is smaller, and still more\r\n     extensively white on all the upper parts.\r\n\r\n     This race reaches its extreme development in Texas; and\r\n     specimens from central Tamaulipas and central Nuevo\r\n     Leon are not so light above, showing a tendency toward\r\n     _Dryobates scalaris bairdi_. They are also somewhat more\r\n     smoky below. There is, however, no difference in size\r\n     between examples from Texas and Tamaulipas.\r\n\r\nThe range of the Texas woodpecker extends northward into southeastern\r\nColorado and southward into southern Tamaulipas. George Finlay Simmons\r\n(1925) says that in Texas it is “rather general in distribution and in\r\nchoice of habitat; somewhat open post oak woods and oak upland gravel\r\nterraces; mesquite forests; hackberry shade trees in town; mesquite\r\nassociation pasturelands; open woods not far from water; marginal\r\ntimber along streams. In the hills, cottonwoods and oaks along stream\r\nbottoms; wooded slopes of gorges. In winter, leafless city shade\r\nhackberry trees.”\r\n\r\nThe Texas woodpecker is widely distributed and fairly common all over\r\nTexas, except in the extreme eastern and extreme western portions;\r\nit is a well known and familiar bird, just as our eastern downy\r\nwoodpecker is in the East; it is locally known as the “Texan sapsucker”\r\nor “ladder-backed woodpecker.” Most of its habits are similar to\r\nthose of the cactus woodpecker, but it seems to enjoy a somewhat more\r\ndiversified habitat and is more inclined to forage and nest in larger\r\ntrees; it is not so strictly confined to the deserts and their environs.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Mr. Simmons (1925) says that the nest is located from “4 to\r\n25, average 12, feet from ground, in rotten stubs or dead and partly\r\ndecayed branches of oak, mesquite, hackberry, and willow trees, usually\r\nalongside lake, river, creek, or ravine; when suitable trees are not\r\nto be found, nests in cedar fence posts or telegraph poles along\r\nroadsides; when in mesquite tree on mesquite-covered prairie, entrance\r\nof cavity on under side of low, drooping limb. * * * Entrance diameter\r\n1.50. Depth of cavity 7 to 8, rarely 10.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The Texas woodpecker lays 2 to 6 eggs, Usually 4 or 5,\r\nrarely as many as 7. These are indistinguishable from the eggs of\r\nthe cactus woodpecker. The measurements of 51 eggs average 20.50 by\r\n15.83 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =22.86=\r\nby 15.75, 20.32 by =17.02=, =17.27= by 15.49, and 19.05 by =14.73=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Mr. Simmons (1925) says that it “searches high up on the\r\nknotty trunks of oak trees in open groves for larvae and eggs of\r\ninjurious wood-boring insects, for the adults of similar as well as\r\nother insects, and for weevils and ants.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Simmons (1925) says that this is “usually a thin,\r\nhigh-pitched, shrill _cheek_; _tcheek, queep_ or _queep-queep_,\r\nuttered as the bird gives a hop in its progress up the\r\ntree-trunk. Sometimes an incredibly rapid, shrill, ringing, even,\r\nnot-so-high-pitched _cheeky-cheeky-cheeky-cheeky-cheeky_ or\r\n_tchee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-deet_; less commonly, _chickp,\r\nchickp, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chick_. Drums rapidly\r\nwith its bill on dead limb of tree at any time of year.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Southwestern United States, Mexico, and British Honduras;\r\nnonmigratory.\r\n\r\nThe range of this woodpecker extends =north= to southern California\r\n(Hesperia and Needles); southern Nevada (Upper Cottonwood Springs);\r\nsouthern Utah (Virgin River Valley); and probably southeastern\r\nColorado (Swink). =East= to probably southeastern Colorado (Swink and\r\nSpringfield); western Oklahoma (Kenton and Hollis); Texas (San Angelo,\r\nKerrville, Boerne, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, and Brownsville);\r\nTamaulipas (Presas and Ciudad Victoria); Yucatan (Chichen-Itza);\r\nQuintana Roo (Cozumel Island); and British Honduras (Manatee Lagoon and\r\nYcacos Lagoon). =South= to British Honduras (Ycacos Lagoon); Jalisco\r\n(Zapotlan); Nayarit (Tres Marias Islands); and Baja California (Cape\r\nSan Lucas). =West= to Baja California (Cape San Lucas, San Jose del\r\nCabo, El Sauz, San Fernando, and Cocopah); and southern California\r\n(Paint Canyon, White Water, and Hesperia).\r\n\r\nThe range as above outlined applies to the entire species, which has,\r\nhowever, been divided into 15 or more subspecies or geographic races.\r\nMost of these, including the typical variety (_Dryobates scalaris\r\nscalaris_), are found only in regions south of the Rio Grande. The four\r\nraces found in North America are distributed as follows: The Texas\r\nwoodpecker (_D. s. symplectus_) is found from southeastern Colorado\r\nsouth and east through east-central Texas, to Coahuila, Tamaulipas,\r\nand Nuevo Leon. The cactus woodpecker (_D. s. cactophilus_) ranges\r\nfrom western Texas through New Mexico, Arizona, and southern Utah and\r\nNevada south to northern Durango. The western edge of the range of\r\nthis race cuts across southeastern California and northeastern Baja\r\nCalifornia. The San Fernando woodpecker (_D. s. eremicus_) is found\r\nin northern Baja California except for the northeastern part. The San\r\nLucas woodpecker (_D. s. lucasanus_) occurs in southern part of Baja\r\nCalifornia north to about latitude 29° N.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--California: 7 records, April 11 to May 9.\r\n  Baja California: 12 records, April 16 to June 2.\r\n  Texas: 45 records, April 14 to June 22; 23 records, April 20 to\r\n    May 7, indicating the height of the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 DRYOBATES SCALARIS LUCASANUS (Xantus)\r\n\r\n                         SAN LUCAS WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe ladder-backed woodpecker of the southern half of the peninsula\r\nof Baja California, Mexico, has long been recognized as a distinct\r\nsubspecies under the above name. It inhabits the Lower Austral deserts\r\nfrom Cape San Lucas north to about latitude 29° N. William Brewster\r\n(1902) says: “Mr. Frazar considers this woodpecker ‘rather common and\r\ngenerally distributed in the cape region, except on the mountains,\r\nwhere it was not met with.’ He found it most numerous about La Paz, but\r\ndid not see it anywhere to the northward of that place during his trip\r\nalong the Gulf coast.”\r\n\r\nThis is a smaller bird than _Dryobates scalaris eremicus_ from the\r\nnorthern half of Baja California; both upper and lower surfaces are\r\nlighter in color, with the white bars on the back broader and with the\r\nsides of the breast spotted. Mr. Brewster (1902) writes:\r\n\r\n     All the characters which have been proposed for this\r\n     Woodpecker are shown by the large series before me to be\r\n     subject to much variation, but this, as in the case of\r\n     _Melanerpes angustifrons_, is confined within limits which\r\n     do not overlap, if, indeed, they quite reach those of the\r\n     bird’s nearest allies. The restriction of the black on the\r\n     outer tail feathers is perhaps its best distinguishing\r\n     feature, although this is not at all uniform, for many of\r\n     my specimens have three complete dark bars crossing both\r\n     webs of the outer tail feathers, while in one a fourth bar\r\n     is only broken by a small space near the middle of the\r\n     feather. The width of the dark bars on the back is also\r\n     variable, although these bars are usually wider than in any\r\n     of the allied forms. The feet average larger than those\r\n     of _bairdi_, but they are by no means _always_ larger. A\r\n     difference which I do not find mentioned in descriptions,\r\n     but which is shown by my series to be quite as constant as\r\n     most of the characters that have been proposed, is that the\r\n     white spots on the top of the head are much larger and more\r\n     numerous than in _bairdi_, while the red is less vivid and\r\n     more nearly restricted to the crown and occiput.\r\n\r\nGriffing Bancroft (1930) writes of this woodpecker, in central Lower\r\nCalifornia, near the northern limit of its supposed range:\r\n\r\n     This little denizen of brush and thick undergrowth requires\r\n     a heavy stand of low cactuses in which to feed and rest.\r\n     It occurs from the shores of the Gulf to the mouth of José\r\n     María Cañon. Though the rarest of the resident Picidae\r\n     it is still fairly common. Its nesting instincts are\r\n     quite distinct from other _Dryobates scalaris_. They,\r\n     similarly situated, would utilize sahuaro, it is true, but\r\n     they would also be prone to add such substitutes as dry\r\n     mescal stalks, telephone poles, tree yucca and mesquite\r\n     and would, more often than not, chose one of these other\r\n     sites by preference. But _lucasanus_ confines itself to\r\n     the cardón, at least in the district we were studying,\r\n     selecting a single-stalked giant cactus and drilling its\r\n     hole very near the top of the plant. As a result the\r\n     nest-cavity is rather uniformly twenty feet above ground.\r\n     The entrance hole is at the top of a cavity typically five\r\n     inches in diameter by fifteen in depth. No foreign material\r\n     is brought in for a nest. The eggs lie on the chips that\r\n     fall in the process of excavating.\r\n\r\n     The number of eggs in a clutch is two, three, or rarely\r\n     four. The first two weeks in May find almost all the San\r\n     Lucas Woodpeckers at the peak of laying. After the middle\r\n     of the month nests with young may be expected. The parent\r\n     bird will ordinarily flush, especially if the cardón be\r\n     tapped, but it is not very nervous about its home. It is\r\n     too busy with family duties to waste much attention on\r\n     strangers.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are similar to those of the other subspecies. Bancroft (1930)\r\ngives the average measurements of 23 eggs as 22.9 by 18.1 millimeters.\r\nThe measurements of 10 other eggs average 21.30 by 16.61 millimeters;\r\nthe eggs, in this series, showing the four extremes measure =24.40=\r\nby 18.70, 23.70 by =18.80=, =19.50= by 16.80, and 21.43 by =15.42=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               DRYOBATES SCALARIS CACTOPHILUS Oberholser\r\n\r\n                           CACTUS WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe ladder-backed woodpeckers are quite widely distributed in the\r\nSouthwestern United States and in nearly all Mexico and in British\r\nHonduras, chiefly in the Lower Austral and Tropical Zones. When Dr.\r\nHarry C. Oberholser (1911b) wrote his revision of this group, he split\r\nthe species _Dryobates scalaris_ into 15 subspecies, 9 of which he\r\ndescribed and named as new subspecies. Only two of these subspecies\r\nare found within the limits of the United States, and only two in Baja\r\nCalifornia, giving us four on our Check-List.\r\n\r\nThe name _Dryobates scalaris bairdi_, which was for a long time used\r\nto designate the ladder-backed woodpeckers of the United States, was\r\nrestricted by Oberholser to a Mexican form. He gave as the characters\r\nof _cactophilus_, “much like _Dryobates scalaris eremicus_, but\r\nsmaller, particularly the tail and bill; lower surface lighter,\r\nlaterally almost always _streaked_ with black; upper parts lighter--the\r\nblack bars on back and scapulars narrower; wing-quills with larger\r\nspots and broader bars of white; outer long rectrices with exterior\r\nwebs barred throughout with black; black bars on posterior lower\r\nsurface narrower.”\r\n\r\nRidgway (1914) compares it with _symplectus_, the Texas bird, as\r\n“slightly larger, and with black bars on back, etc., decidedly broader.”\r\n\r\nThe cactus woodpecker ranges, according to the 1931 A. O. U.\r\nCheck-List, from “central western Texas through New Mexico and Arizona\r\nto extreme northeastern Lower California and southeastern California,\r\nnorth to extreme southern Nevada and southwestern Utah, and south to\r\nnorthern Durango.” It frequents the deserts, or the borders of the\r\ndeserts, and the lower slopes of the mountains in the Sonoran Zone, a\r\nhot, dry region where there are no trees of any size and where this is\r\nabout the only species of woodpecker found. We never found it in the\r\ngiant-cactus, or saguaro, region, where it seemed to be replaced by\r\nthe noisy Gila woodpecker and Mearns’s gilded flicker. W. Leon Dawson\r\n(1923) says:\r\n\r\n     Of course it must not be understood that the Cactus\r\n     Woodpecker tries to live in the central wastes of the\r\n     desert; for however much it may forage over the creosote\r\n     and cholla patches, on occasion, it requires something of\r\n     more ample girth for a nesting site. Hence its breeding\r\n     range is confined to the more fruitful upper edges of\r\n     the Lower Sonoran zone, and to the moister bottoms. In\r\n     the former situation the dried stalks of the agave and\r\n     the lesser yucca (_whipplei_), or of the Joshua tree\r\n     (_Yucca arborescens_), and the Mohave Yucca offer asylum.\r\n     In the valley of the Colorado, fearing no rivalry from\r\n     _D. pubescens turati_, the Cactus Woodpecker is able to\r\n     monopolize the willows which grow so rankly along the\r\n     lagoons.\r\n\r\nReferring to Arizona, Harry S. Swarth (1904) says: “This woodpecker is\r\nseldom seen above 5,500 feet, and rarely ventures into the canyons. On\r\nthe plains below, wherever there is brush or trees, and all along the\r\nSan Pedro River it is very common, as in fact, I have found it in all\r\nsimilar places I have visited in southern Arizona.”\r\n\r\nSwarth says elsewhere (1929):\r\n\r\n     In southeastern Arizona, east of the Santa Rita Mountains,\r\n     the vast areas of prairie land are for the most part\r\n     unsuitable to this species. Wherever even a scanty growth\r\n     of chaparral has found a foothold, though, the Cactus\r\n     Woodpecker is pretty sure to occur, for it does not require\r\n     large trees. Along the streams and washes in this same\r\n     area, as elsewhere, it does frequent the sycamores and\r\n     other larger growths, but these do not form the preferred\r\n     habitat. In the lowlands west of the Santa Rita Mountains\r\n     this woodpecker is in the surroundings that suit it best.\r\n     It does not frequent the giant cactus (I do not believe\r\n     that there is a known instance of its nesting in one), but\r\n     stays nearer the ground, in cholla cactus, creosote bush,\r\n     catclaw or other low-growing vegetation.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Major Bendire (1895) writes:\r\n\r\n     In southern New Mexico and Arizona it nests sometimes in\r\n     the flowering stems of the agave plant and also in yucca\r\n     trees, and I have found it nesting on Rillito Creek,\r\n     Arizona, in a small dead willow sapling not over 3½ inches\r\n     in diameter. The cavity was about 12 feet from the ground\r\n     and 10 inches in depth, and the entrance hole a trifle over\r\n     1½ inches in diameter. This nest was found on June 8, 1872,\r\n     and contained only two eggs, in which incubation was about\r\n     one-half advanced; the eggs laid on fine chips. The nesting\r\n     sites are placed at various distances from the ground, from\r\n     3 to 30, usually from 6 to 14 feet. Dead branches of trees\r\n     or partly decayed ones seem to be preferred to live ones.\r\n     * * * It nests by preference in mesquite trees, one of our\r\n     hardest woods, and it must require a long time to chisel\r\n     out a nesting site in one of these trees. While it is true\r\n     that the heart is usually more or less decayed, the birds\r\n     have first to work through an inch or two of solid wood\r\n     which is almost impervious to a sharp ax.\r\n\r\nMrs. Florence M. Bailey (1928) says that in New Mexico the nests are\r\n“from 2 to 30 feet from the ground in holes in mesquite, screw bean,\r\npalo verde, hackberry, and China trees, willows, cottonwoods, walnuts,\r\noaks, and other trees, telegraph poles, fence posts, and stalks of\r\nagave, yucca, and cactus.”\r\n\r\nWhile collecting with Frank C. Willard, in southern Arizona, we found\r\nthe cactus woodpecker fairly common about Tombstone and near Fairbanks\r\non the San Pedro River. Near the former place, one nest was 6½ feet up\r\nin a fence post; the cavity was about 10 inches deep and 3¼ inches in\r\ndiameter at the bottom; another nest was in a cavity 12 inches deep in\r\nthe dry stalk of a mescal about 5 feet from the ground. In the valley\r\nof the San Pedro River, we found a nest about 12 feet from the ground\r\nin a willow stub; and another nest was located in a stump of a willow\r\nbeside a fence; it was only 6 feet up in the solid part of the stub,\r\nand so well concealed behind a bunch of sprouts that we had passed it\r\nmany times without seeing it.\r\n\r\nMr. Willard (1918) says:\r\n\r\n     “Along the San Pedro River the Cactus Woodpecker\r\n     (_Dryobates s. cactophilus_) is the only one nesting at all\r\n     commonly. In the lines of willows bordering the irrigation\r\n     ditches and in all the small groups found along the river\r\n     banks, I had quite a list of pairs whose nests I could\r\n     count upon finding within certain circumscribed areas.\r\n     They exhibited individual characteristics. One pair never\r\n     dug its nest lower than twenty feet from the ground and\r\n     usually selected a site that overhung the water. Another\r\n     liked short stubs not over five or six feet tall. Another\r\n     was partial to fence posts. While these selections were\r\n     not invariably followed they were so usual that I always\r\n     began my search by examining all the available sites of\r\n     that character before looking at others and was usually\r\n     successful in my first search.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The cactus woodpecker lays 2 to 6 eggs, usually 4 or 5.\r\nThese are usually oval or short oval, sometimes elliptical-oval or\r\nelliptical-ovate. They are pure white and more or less glossy. The\r\nmeasurements of 18 eggs average 21.48 by 16.18 millimeters; the eggs\r\nshowing the four extremes measure =23.02= by 16.67, 22.5 by =17.0=, and\r\n=19.2= by =15.1= millimeters. Bendire (1895) says that incubation lasts\r\nfor about 13 days and is shared by both sexes.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The young are probably hatched naked (I have not seen\r\nany), as is the case with other woodpeckers, but the juvenal plumage is\r\nacquired before the young bird leaves the nest. This first plumage is\r\nmuch like that of the adult male, but the sexes are not quite alike.\r\nIn the young male, the forehead, sides of the occiput, and the nape\r\nare uniform black; only the crown is scarlet, more or less dotted with\r\nwhite. The young female is similar to the young male, except that there\r\nis usually much less scarlet on the crown, often only a few scarlet\r\ntips. In both sexes the back is barred with dull black and grayish\r\nwhite, instead of the clear black and white of the adult; the under\r\nparts are “vinaceous-buff,” faintly spotted on the sides and flanks;\r\nthe plumage is softer and the markings are not so clearly defined as\r\nin the adult. Just how long this plumage is worn I have not been able\r\nto determine, but July birds show signs of body molt and an increasing\r\namount of the clear black streaks of the adult plumage on the sides and\r\nflanks. Probably a plumage that is practically adult is assumed by the\r\nfirst fall at the latest. Adults apparently have a complete annual molt\r\nin summer, mainly in August.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The cactus woodpecker lives mainly on the larvae of\r\nwood-boring beetles, which it gleans from the trunks and branches\r\nof trees. It also eats the larvae of the coddling moth and other\r\nLepidoptera, ants, caterpillars, and cotton worms. It usually forages\r\nat low elevations on small trees, shrubs, and various cacti and is\r\noften seen feeding on the ground. Major Bendire (1895) says that this\r\nwoodpecker, “like several other species, is very fond of the ripe\r\nfiglike fruit of the giant cactus, and I have met it more than once in\r\nSahuarito Pass, Arizona, eating it on the ground.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Ralph Hoffmann (1927) compares the notes of the cactus\r\nwoodpecker with those of the downy woodpecker and says that “the common\r\nnotes are a single high-pitched _tschik_ or a longer rattling call with\r\na slight fall toward the end. It often calls as it flies, and like\r\nother woodpeckers drums in spring on dry limbs.” Dawson (1923) refers\r\nto the notes as “his _plink, plink_, and his long rolling chirrup.”\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--A small woodpecker with the upper parts distinctly and\r\nextensively barred with black and white is either one of the races\r\nof _Dryobates scalaris_, commonly called ladderbacks, or _Dryobates\r\nnuttalli_. These two species are very much alike in superficial\r\nappearance and might be easily confused; but fortunately their ranges\r\ndo not overlap, except to a slight extent in some of the mountain\r\npasses of southeastern California. Mr. Dawson (1923) says that the\r\ncactus woodpecker “is browner above, more strikingly, heavily, and\r\nnumerously barred, with less of black on sides of head, and red (of\r\nadult male) pervading crown as well as nape.”\r\n\r\n_Winter._--W. E. D. Scott (1886) says that these woodpeckers “are at\r\ntimes gregarious. I particularly noticed this in December, 1885, when\r\nI frequently met the species in flocks of from four to a dozen, on the\r\nplains at an altitude of 3,000 feet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                DRYOBATES SCALARIS EREMICUS Oberholser\r\n\r\n                        SAN FERNANDO WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThis race of ladder-backed woodpeckers occupies the northern half of\r\nBaja California, north of the range of _Dryobates scalaris lucasanus_,\r\nwith which it intergrades about midway the peninsular. It is described\r\nby Dr. H. C. Oberholser (1911b) as “similar to _Dryobates scalaris\r\nlucasanus_, but larger; lower surface darker; upper parts darker, the\r\nwhite bars on back averaging narrower and less regular, the black bars\r\nwider; black bars on posterior lower parts averaging somewhat wider.”\r\n\r\nVery little seems to have appeared in print about this woodpecker,\r\nbut, as it lives in a similar habitat to that occupied by the San\r\nLucas woodpecker, it probably does not differ materially from it in\r\nhabits. It lives in the lowland, desert regions and nests in the giant\r\ncactus. Both races are said to be rather shy. It is replaced in extreme\r\nnorthwestern Baja California by Nuttall’s woodpecker and in the extreme\r\nnortheast by the cactus woodpecker.\r\n\r\nGriffing Bancroft (1930) states that the measurements of nine eggs of\r\nthis subspecies average 21.7 by 16.7 millimeters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      DRYOBATES NUTTALLI (Gambel)\r\n\r\n                         NUTTALL’S WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                             PLATES 11, 12\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThough closely resembling, superficially, the ladder-backed woodpeckers\r\nof the _scalaris_ group, Nuttall’s woodpecker is a very distinct\r\nspecies; the ranges of the two species come together at several points\r\nbut do not overlap; and the habitats of the two are in different\r\ntypes of environment. The 1931 A. O. U. Check-List gives the range\r\nof _nuttalli_ as “Upper Austral Zone west of the southern Cascade\r\nMountains and the Sierra Nevada from southern Oregon to northwestern\r\nLower California.”\r\n\r\nW. Leon Dawson (1923) described the haunts of this woodpecker very\r\nwell, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Although one who is forming the acquaintance of the Nuttall\r\n     Woodpecker soon learns where to look for him, his range\r\n     is hard to characterize in terms of associations. Upper\r\n     Sonoran, foothill, oak, live oak, chaparral, deciduous\r\n     trees bordering narrow stream beds--all these apply to\r\n     _nuttalli_ well enough, but they are not exhaustive, save\r\n     for the first, which is all inclusive. Within Upper Sonoran\r\n     limits it is, perhaps, easier to tell where he will not be\r\n     found; thus, not (or only occasionally) in pine timber;\r\n     not in stands of pure willow (which are given over to _D.\r\n     pubescens turati_); not in orchards, nor about cultures of\r\n     any sort; not, most decidedly, “nesting in giant cactus.”\r\n     Least of all, is it “seldom found along streams,” as one\r\n     precocious authority avers. A narrow canyon whose floor\r\n     harbors sycamores and alders and bay trees, nourished by a\r\n     purling stream, and whose sides are lined with live oaks\r\n     which run up into ceanothus chaparral, is precisely the\r\n     best place to look for _D. nuttalli_.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Major Bendire (1895) quotes the following contribution from\r\nB. T. Gault:\r\n\r\n     I had been out on the bowlder plain [in the San Bernardino\r\n     Valley] several hours, on the morning of April 23, 1883,\r\n     collecting birds, and spying a clump of elder bushes in\r\n     the distance, not far from the brook, the thought occurred\r\n     to me that I might take a rest beneath their shade and\r\n     at the same time be ready for any bird that put in an\r\n     appearance. These bushes, or more properly trees, are a\r\n     great deal larger shrub than our eastern plant, their\r\n     trunks growing from 4 to 8 inches through; and if they\r\n     are not the same species, their umbellate blossoms are\r\n     strikingly similar, if not identical, to those of our\r\n     common eastern shrub (_Sambucus canadensis_). I had hardly\r\n     seated myself on an arm of the shrub when my attention was\r\n     attracted to a hole in the main trunk, directly above my\r\n     head. At almost the same instant a bird appeared at the\r\n     opening from within, and dodged back again as soon as she\r\n     saw me. The movement was executed so quickly that I was\r\n     unable to tell whether it was a wren or a woodpecker, but\r\n     concluded that it was the latter. Upon examination of the\r\n     aperture it seemed to have been lately made. Of course I\r\n     thought that there would be no trouble in dislodging her,\r\n     and commenced to rap on the trunk of the shrub with the\r\n     butt of my gun; but this seemed to have no effect. I then\r\n     walked back about 50 feet, and taking a stand, waited from\r\n     ten to fifteen minutes in the hope that she would come out,\r\n     affording me an opportunity to secure her and thus solve\r\n     the mystery, but in this maneuver I was also baffled. I\r\n     then went up to the bush and shouted with all my might,\r\n     but this did not shake her nervous system in the least,\r\n     when I finally resorted to my jackknife in order to enlarge\r\n     the orifice, but, from its being such a tedious job, gave\r\n     it up in disgust. The next morning I took a hatchet along\r\n     with me, for I desired very much to know what that hole\r\n     contained. It did not take me very long to cut a place\r\n     large enough for me to get my hand in, and I was thoroughly\r\n     surprised to learn that the bird was still on her nest. I\r\n     pulled her out, and she appeared to be stupefied--dead,\r\n     apparently--but soon revived. Upon further inspection I\r\n     found that the nest contained eggs. The bird proved to be a\r\n     female Nuttall’s woodpecker, and the eggs were pretty well\r\n     advanced in incubation and would have hatched in a few days.\r\n\r\n     The nest, which was about 5½ feet from the ground, was\r\n     nearly a foot deep and about 5 inches wide. The hole at the\r\n     entrance to the nest was but a little larger than a silver\r\n     half dollar. The eggs were six in number.\r\n\r\nMr. Dawson’s (1923) remarks on the nesting of this woodpecker are\r\nrather cryptic, but I infer from them that it nests in willows, alders,\r\nelders, cottonwoods, sycamores, live oaks, and other oaks and at\r\nheights varying from 2½ to 60 feet above ground. The only nest of this\r\nspecies that I have seen was shown to me by A. M. Ingersoll, while\r\ncollecting with him and James B. Dixon, in San Diego County, Calif.,\r\non April 9, 1929; the nest, which the birds had not quite finished\r\nexcavating, was about 30 feet from the ground in a leaning, dead\r\ncottonwood tree (pl. 11). A set of four eggs in my collection was taken\r\nby Henry W. Carriger, on April 23, 1897, in Sonoma County, Calif.; the\r\nnest was in a dead limb of a large laurel along a creek; he had taken a\r\nset of six eggs from the same tree the previous year.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Nuttall’s woodpecker lays three to six eggs, most commonly\r\nfour and often five. These are ovate, or rarely short-ovate or\r\nelliptical-ovate. The color is dull creamy white or pure white, and\r\nsometimes rather glossy. The measurements of 47 eggs average 21.75 by\r\n16.27 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =25.0= by\r\n16.0, 23.3 by =17.0=, =19.30= by 15.75, and 19.7 by =14.6= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation is said to be about 14 days, and to\r\nbe shared by both sexes. Mr. Dawson (1923) says:\r\n\r\n     The male Nuttall not only takes a lively interest in all\r\n     matters connected with the nesting, but it is believed\r\n     that he monopolizes the task of excavation. Certainly he\r\n     takes his turn at incubating, and he is invariably, in\r\n     my experience, the more valiant of the two in defense of\r\n     young. The female, however, is probably the closer sitter,\r\n     as there are several instances in which she has submitted\r\n     to the hand rather than forsake her trust. * * * When\r\n     the chicks are astir the father is fairly beside himself\r\n     with joy and apprehension. In fact, if you ever require\r\n     a symbol of doting solicitude, picture a male Nuttall\r\n     woodpecker thrusting his head into a dark hole to make\r\n     sure that nothing has spilled out of it since his last\r\n     inspection--which occurred exactly three seconds ago.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The young are hatched naked, as with other woodpeckers,\r\nbut the juvenal plumage is acquired before the young leave the nest.\r\nThe young male, in juvenal plumage, has the forehead, occiput, and nape\r\nuniform dull black, leaving only the crown scarlet, spotted or speckled\r\nwith white dots; the black bars on the back are dull black and the\r\nwhite bars are grayish white, instead of clear black and pure white,\r\nas in the adult; these bars are also less clearly defined than in the\r\nadult; the under parts are yellowish white, spotted on the sides and\r\nflanks less distinctly than in the adult, and with pale dusky, instead\r\nof clear black; the wings and tail are as in the adult.\r\n\r\nThe young female is similar to the young male, except that the red of\r\nthe crown is more restricted and the forehead is streaked with white.\r\nThis plumage is, apparently, worn all through the first summer; I have\r\nseen young birds in this plumage as late as August 30. Probably early\r\nin fall a postjuvenal molt produces a plumage that is practically\r\nadult. I have been unable to learn anything about the molts of adults.\r\nRidgway (1914) says that spring males have the “white streaks on\r\nforehead and crown much reduced in size, sometimes obsolete, and\r\nred nuchal area more restricted, through wearing off of red tips of\r\nfeathers.” The white streaks on the crown of the adult female also wear\r\naway almost entirely during winter, leaving the crown clear black.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The food of Nuttall’s woodpecker is very similar to that of\r\nthe downy and other small woodpeckers. Prof. F. E. L. Beal (1911)\r\nsummarizes it by saying: “In its animal food the Nuttall woodpecker\r\nis beyond criticism. Practically all of the insects eaten are either\r\npests or of no positive benefit. While some fruit is eaten, it consists\r\nlargely, and perhaps entirely, of wild varieties. Probably the worst\r\nthat can be said of the bird is that it helps in the distribution of\r\npoison-oak seeds.”\r\n\r\nAmong the insect food, the most prominent items seem to be the larvae\r\nof the very harmful wood-boring beetles Cerambycidae and Elateridae;\r\nother beetles are eaten largely, as well as ants and other Hymenoptera,\r\nscales, plant lice and other bugs, weevils, caterpillars, spiders,\r\nflies, and millipeds. Prof. Beal (1911) says: “Two stomachs contained\r\neach between 30 and 40 box-elder bugs (_Leptocoris trivittatus_).\r\nThese insects have a way of becoming very abundant at times and making\r\na nuisance of themselves by invading buildings in search of winter\r\nquarters.”\r\n\r\nThe vegetable food consists mainly of wild fruits, such as\r\nblackberries, elderberries, and the seeds of poison-oaks; a few acorns\r\nand some grain are occasionally eaten. Grinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale\r\n(1930) write: “Trees that this woodpecker foraged over were sycamore,\r\ncotton, valley oak, blue oak (most frequently), digger pine, yellow\r\npine (rarely), and orchard trees. On June 3, 1926, one was seen feeding\r\non cherries in an orchard near Manton.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Florence M. Bailey (1902) says of this little woodpecker:\r\n\r\n     It has a nuthatch-like way of flying up to light on the\r\n     underside of a limb, and when hanging upside down turns\r\n     itself around with as much ease as a fly on a ceiling. * * *\r\n\r\n     He is a sturdy little fellow, and in flight will sometimes\r\n     rise high in air and fly long and steadily, dipping only\r\n     slightly over the brush. He has the full strength of his\r\n     convictions and will drive a big flicker from a sycamore\r\n     and then stretch up on a branch and call out triumphantly.\r\n     Two Nuttalls trying to decide whether to fight are an\r\n     amusing sight. They shake their feathers and scold and\r\n     dance about as if they were aching to fly at each other,\r\n     but couldn’t quite make up their minds to so grave a matter.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The same writer says of the voice of Nuttall’s woodpecker:\r\n“At times the small Nuttall waxes excited, and shakes his wings as\r\nhe gives his thin, rattling call. All his notes are thin, and his\r\n_quee-quee-quee-quee’p_ has a sharp quality. His _chit’ tah_ is a\r\ndiminutive of the _ja’ cob_ of the California woodpecker.”\r\n\r\nRalph Hoffmann (1927) says: “One cannot remain long near a grove of\r\nlive oaks in the foothills of California without hearing from some\r\ntree a hoarse ringing call _prrip_, often lengthened to a rattling\r\n_prrrrrrt_. It has the exclamatory quality of the Hairy Woodpecker’s,\r\nbut is less clear and metallic, with more burr. * * * Like the other\r\nwoodpeckers the Nuttall, particularly in spring, drums on resonant\r\ntimber or telephone poles; it also gives at that season a rapid,\r\nsquealing _quee quee quee quee_.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dawson (1923) says that this woodpecker “always has a grouch on,\r\nand you are sure to be challenged as you pass, by repetition of his\r\ndouble notes of distrust, _ticket, ticket--ticket it_.”\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--Nuttall’s woodpecker closely resembles the cactus\r\nwoodpecker, and where the ranges of the two species come together, in\r\nsoutheastern California, there is a chance for confusion; but their\r\nranges barely touch each other, and fortunately the habitats of the\r\ntwo species are quite different and mainly well separated. Nuttall’s\r\nis somewhat lighter colored on the under parts, and the black bands\r\non the back are slightly wider than in the cactus woodpecker; but\r\nthe best distinguishing mark, if the observer is near enough to see\r\nit, is the black forehead and front of the crown, which in the male\r\ncactus woodpecker is spotted with white and red. It is only slightly\r\nlarger than the downy woodpeckers but can be readily distinguished\r\nfrom that species by the conspicuous, transverse barring of black and\r\nwhite on the back, instead of the broad, white, longitudinal band of\r\nthe downies; there are also more white spots in the wings than in the\r\nwestern races of the downy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Southwestern Oregon, California, and northern Baja\r\nCalifornia; nonmigratory.\r\n\r\nThe range of Nuttall’s woodpecker extends =north= to southwestern\r\nOregon (probably Ashland); and northern California (Weed and Lassen\r\nPeak). =East= to California (Lassen Peak, Oroville, probably Florence\r\nLake, Owens Lake, and Redlands); and Baja California (San Rafael and\r\nSan Domingo). =South= to northern Baja California (San Domingo and\r\nEnsenada). =West= to northwestern Baja California (Ensenada); western\r\nCalifornia (San Diego, San Onofre, Santa Barbara, Morro, Monterey, and\r\nEast Park); and southwestern Oregon (probably Ashland).\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--California: 82 records, March 25 to June 14; 41\r\n    records, April 21 to May 6, indicating the height of the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 DRYOBATES ARIZONAE ARIZONAE (Hargitt)\r\n\r\n                          ARIZONA WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nStrickland’s woodpecker (_Dryobates stricklandi_), a Mexican species,\r\nwas formerly recorded from southern Arizona by some of the early\r\nwriters; but Edward Hargitt (1886) discovered that the Arizona bird was\r\nspecifically distinct, described it, and named it as a new species,\r\n_Picus arizonae_. He gave it the following diagnosis: “_P._ similis _P.\r\nstricklandi_, sed dorso uniformi nec albofasciato distinguendus.” The\r\ntwo species are quite similar in general appearance, but _stricklandi_\r\nhas the median portion of the back and the whole rump broadly barred or\r\ntransversely spotted with white, whereas in _arizonae_ these parts are\r\nuniformly plain brown, and the markings on the under parts are in the\r\nform of large rounded or subcordate spots, instead of streaks.\r\n\r\nThe range of the Arizona woodpecker includes southeastern Arizona,\r\nsouthwestern New Mexico, Sonora, Chihuahua, and northwestern Durango;\r\nit is another one of those Mexican species that barely crosses our\r\nsouthwestern border.\r\n\r\nHenry W. Henshaw (1875) was the first to report this woodpecker, under\r\nthe name of Strickland’s woodpecker, as entitled to a place in our\r\nfauna; he writes: “This rare woodpecker is a common species on the\r\nfoothills of the Chiricahua Mountains, where it was one of the first\r\nbirds that met my eye when the section where it abounds was first\r\nentered. Whether it extends upward, and finds its home during a portion\r\nof the year among the pines that here begin at an altitude of about\r\n1,000 [10,000?] feet, I do not know. So far as I could ascertain, at\r\nthis season at least [August], it is confined to the region of the\r\noaks, ranging from about 4,000 to 7,000 feet, thus inhabiting a region\r\nabout midway between the low valleys and the mountain districts proper.”\r\n\r\nHarry S. Swarth (1904) writes: “Although the Arizona Woodpecker is\r\nresident the year through in the Huachucas, it is singular how the\r\nbirds seem to disappear in the breeding season, that is from the middle\r\nof April to the middle of June, when the young birds begin to leave the\r\nnest. During this time their loud shrill call may be occasionally heard\r\nfrom some wooded hillside, but the birds themselves are seldom seen. I\r\nhave taken specimens from the base of the mountains, about 4,500 feet\r\naltitude, up to 8,000 feet, but they are not often seen above 7,000\r\nfeet.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--We found the Arizona woodpecker well distributed in Ramsay\r\nCanyon in the Huachuca Mountains from the base of the mountains up to\r\n7,500 feet, but nowhere common. On April 15, 1922, while exploring the\r\nlower part of the canyon, which is quite heavily wooded with giant\r\nsycamores, various oaks, ash, maples, black walnut, and locusts, we\r\nsaw an Arizona woodpecker excavating a nest hole in a solid dead stub,\r\nabout 50 feet up near the top of one of the big sycamores. The hole\r\nwas on the under side of the stub and deep enough to take in all the\r\nbird but the tail. A red-shafted flicker was “yuckering” in the top\r\nof another big tree, and I think it had designs on this nest, for it\r\nsubsequently drove away the Arizona woodpecker; and later on the nest\r\nwas found to have been deserted. We found only one occupied nest; this\r\nwas at an altitude of about 7,500 feet in a branch of Ramsay Canyon; it\r\nwas about 20 feet from the ground in a dead branch of a small walnut\r\ntree, which was growing up through an oak on the steep mountain side;\r\nthe entrance to the cavity, which was about 12 inches deep, was well\r\nhidden; it contained three eggs well advanced in incubation on May 16,\r\n1922. The birds were heard in the vicinity, and one was seen to relieve\r\nthe other on the nest. Frank C. Willard’s notes record the finding of\r\ntwo nests of this woodpecker in the same region on May 24, 1899; these\r\nwere both in dead branches of oak trees; one was 15 and one 18 feet\r\nfrom the ground, and the nesting cavities were both 12 inches deep;\r\n“one bird was seen to leave the nest and the other one entered it;\r\nafter it got in, it stuck its head out and uttered one sharp note, like\r\na grosbeak’s, which was answered by its mate.”\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) mentions a nest, found by Dr. A. K. Fisher in\r\nGarden Canyon in the Huachuca Mountains, on May 14, that was “in a\r\nlarge maple which overhung a stream. The cavity was situated in a dry\r\nbranch, about 20 feet from the ground, and was about a foot in depth.\r\nIt contained four young, which were still naked.” There are two sets of\r\nfour eggs each in the Thayer collection; one was taken by O. W. Howard\r\nin the Huachuca Mountains on April 24, 1902, from a nest in a mescal\r\nstalk, 8 feet from the ground; the other was collected by Virgil W.\r\nOwen in the Chiricahua Mountains, on April 22, 1906; the entrance to\r\nthe cavity was 9 feet up on the under side of a slightly leaning, dead\r\nand decaying stub of an oak limb in a dead tree.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The Arizona woodpecker apparently lays either three or four\r\neggs; we have no record of more or fewer. The few that I have seen\r\nare practically ovate; they are pure white and some are quite glossy,\r\nothers less so. The measurements of 27 eggs average 22.82 by 17.33\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =24.0= by\r\n=18.0=, =19.9= by 16.7, and 22.5 by =16.5= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation does not seem to have been\r\ndefinitely determined, but it is probably about 14 days, as with other\r\n_Dryobates_. Both sexes assist in this task, and probably in the care\r\nof the young.\r\n\r\nH. S. Swarth (1904) writes:\r\n\r\n     About the third week in April they commence laying their\r\n     eggs, and after the middle of June the young birds begin\r\n     to leave the nest, and soon become quite abundant. I have\r\n     never had any difficulty in approaching these birds as\r\n     they are usually quite tame and unsuspicious; far more so\r\n     than the generality of woodpeckers, and the young birds\r\n     are noticeably so. I have several times stood within ten\r\n     feet of a young bird, easily distinguishable by his red\r\n     cap, as he was industriously pounding on a limb without\r\n     seeming in the least disturbed by my presence, or showing\r\n     any inclination to leave. On one occasion the confiding,\r\n     and in this case inquiring nature of the bird occasioned\r\n     rather a laughable scene. An acquaintance in the mountains,\r\n     passing the camp one day stopped to lead his horse down\r\n     to the well which supplied us with water. A young Arizona\r\n     Woodpecker was sitting in an oak tree close by, and soon\r\n     after the horse began drinking he flew down, and lighting\r\n     on the animal’s hind leg as on the side of a tree, hit it\r\n     a vigorous rap or two. The horse and its owner appeared\r\n     equally surprised, and both moving a little the bird\r\n     retreated to his tree. It wasn’t a minute before he was\r\n     back again, this time on a front leg, where he went to\r\n     work with such energy as to start the horse plunging and\r\n     kicking in an effort to get rid of its curious assailant.\r\n     The woodpecker left but did not seem to be particularly\r\n     frightened, as he sat on the wooden curb of the well until\r\n     he was left alone again.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The young are hatched naked but acquire the juvenal\r\nplumage before leaving the nest. In three young males in my collection,\r\ntaken on June 20, August 4, and August 30, the upper parts are much\r\nlike those of the adult male, but the crown is more or less invaded\r\nwith scarlet or vermilion-tipped feathers, sometimes with only a few\r\nscattered feathers and sometimes covering the whole crown and nape;\r\nthey are more heavily spotted on the breast and more heavily barred on\r\nthe belly than are the fall adults, and these markings are dark sepia,\r\ninstead of black, and less well defined than in adults; the bills are\r\nsmaller and weaker. Mr. Swarth (1904) says: “In the young female,\r\nbesides occupying a less extensive surface, the red is less intense\r\nthan in the male, and not as solid, that is there is always more or\r\nless brown showing through. The red cap of the juvenile bird seems\r\nto be worn but a short time, as a young female taken September 4 has\r\nhardly a trace of it remaining.”\r\n\r\nApparently the juvenal plumage is molted, including the wings and tail,\r\nlate in August or September, when the first winter plumage, which is\r\npractically indistinguishable from that of the adult, is acquired. Mr.\r\nSwarth (1904) says of the molt of the adult:\r\n\r\n     The Arizona woodpecker commences to moult about the middle\r\n     of July, and by the first week in September the new plumage\r\n     is almost completely acquired. The plumage of the breast,\r\n     abdomen, and lower parts generally, seems to be the first\r\n     to be renewed, while the remiges, rectrices and feathers of\r\n     the interscapular region are the last to get their growth.\r\n     An old female shot on September 3 had practically completed\r\n     its moult, with the exception of the tail feathers, none of\r\n     which were over half an inch long; while several specimens\r\n     of both sexes, taken during the last two weeks in August,\r\n     are in nearly perfect autumnal plumage, except for some\r\n     small patches of old feathers in the interscapular region.\r\n     Fall specimens are considerably darker on the back than\r\n     birds taken during the spring and summer, but the change is\r\n     undoubtedly due to fading of the plumage, as birds taken in\r\n     the late winter and early spring, show not the slightest\r\n     traces of moult, and a series of birds taken from February\r\n     to July, show plainly the gradual change of coloration.\r\n     Singularly enough the pileum and back of the neck does not\r\n     seem to fade as the dorsum does, and consequently, while\r\n     birds in fresh fall plumage are of practically uniform\r\n     coloration on the upper parts, specimens taken in the late\r\n     spring and summer have the head and neck abruptly darker\r\n     than the back and exposed portion of the wings. * * * Of\r\n     twenty-four specimens from this region [Arizona] four show\r\n     more or less traces of white bars across the rump; one of\r\n     these is a male in nuptial plumage, one a male in freshly\r\n     acquired autumnal plumage, one a female in nuptial plumage\r\n     (this specimen has some faint indications of white bars on\r\n     some of the scapulars as well), and one is a young male.\r\n     Another spring female has some white bars on the scapulars\r\n     but none on the rump. Presumably this is a tendency toward\r\n     the Mexican species _Dryobates stricklandi_.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Very little seems to be recorded on the food of the Arizona\r\nwoodpecker, which probably does not differ greatly from that of other\r\nmembers of the _Dryobates_ group. It apparently feeds mainly on insects\r\nand their larvae, but to some extent on fruits and acorns. Mr. Henshaw\r\n(1875) says of its feeding habits: “When in pursuit of food, they\r\nalmost always alighted near the base of the trees, gradually ascending,\r\nand making their way along the smaller limbs, and even out among the\r\nfoliage, appearing to prefer to secure their food by a careful search\r\nrather than by the hard labor of cutting into the wood in the way the\r\nhairy woodpecker employs its strength.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The same observer says of their habits:\r\n\r\n     Here they appeared to be perfectly at home, climbing over\r\n     the trunks of the oaks with the same ease and rapidity of\r\n     movement that distinguish the motions of the downy or hairy\r\n     woodpecker; though their habits, in so far as they are at\r\n     all peculiar, are, perhaps, best comparable to those of\r\n     the red-cockaded woodpecker of the South (_P. borealis_),\r\n     especially their custom of moving about in small companies\r\n     of from five to fifteen, though they were occasionally\r\n     found singly or in pairs. * * *\r\n\r\n     I found them at all times rather shy, and gifted with very\r\n     little of that prying curiosity which is seen in some of\r\n     the better known species of this family; and if by chance\r\n     I surprised a band feeding among the low trees, a sharp\r\n     warning note, from some member more watchful than the rest,\r\n     communicated alarm to the whole assembly, when they took\r\n     flight immediately, showing great dexterity in dodging\r\n     behind trunks and limbs, and making good their retreat by\r\n     short flights from one tree to another till they were out\r\n     of sight.\r\n\r\nIn the Whetstone Mountains, Ariz., Austin Paul Smith (1908) observed a\r\nfemale Arizona woodpecker--\r\n\r\n     working on an oak-trunk, not three feet above the base;\r\n     while the trees around harbored unnumbered Bridled\r\n     Tits (_Baeolophus wollweberi_), Lead-colored Bush-tits\r\n     (_Psaltriparus plumbeus_) and Rocky Mountain Nuthatches\r\n     (_Sitta carolinensis nelsoni_). Very often did I run across\r\n     a similar assemblage, but rarely were there more than one\r\n     or two Arizona Woodpeckers in it. There is no recollection\r\n     at hand, of noting above four adult woodpeckers of this\r\n     species in view at once; more likely to chance upon a\r\n     solitary individual than a pair at any time. The noisiest\r\n     occasion I can accredit to the species occurred one spring\r\n     day when two adult females were located, perched upon\r\n     a horizontal limb of a madrona, facing each other, and\r\n     emitting a continuous volume of characteristic woodpecker\r\n     notes, the effect being heightened by that peculiar\r\n     muscular movement which accompanies the vocal utterances of\r\n     some Pici. The continuity was possible by a relay system;\r\n     and so engrossed were the participants, that I approached\r\n     to directly under the limb and stood there at least two\r\n     minutes, without being detected.\r\n\r\nF. H. Fowler (1903) writes:\r\n\r\n     The Arizona woodpecker (_Dryobates arizonae_) is, outside\r\n     of the alpine three-toed and pileated, the most interesting\r\n     member of the woodpecker family, that I have ever seen. So\r\n     far as I have noted, the species is never common, never\r\n     noisy, and never at rest. I have not found it except in\r\n     live-oak woods, and at Fort Huachuca; on a good field\r\n     day I used to see about six on an average. Not even the\r\n     chickadees are as active as this little woodpecker. He\r\n     will alight on the main trunk of the tree, or generally\r\n     one of the largest limbs, and the moment his claws are\r\n     fastened in the bark he begins an untiring search for\r\n     insects and grubs. He ascends rapidly in spirals picking\r\n     and prying away small pieces of bark in search of food;\r\n     when a promising limb is reached out he goes on it, often\r\n     on the lower side. The search over in one tree, he wastes\r\n     no time in looking around, but launches out, with barely a\r\n     glance to determine the course, in his undulating flight\r\n     to the next, there to repeat the performance. When closely\r\n     approached, he works around the tree without paying any\r\n     especial attention to the intruder, and when thoroughly\r\n     frightened he will take flight with as little warning as he\r\n     does when simply in search of food. While going up the tree\r\n     he gives, from time to time, a characteristic call, much\r\n     like that of the hairy woodpecker.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The Arizona woodpecker should be easily recognized, as\r\nit is the only small woodpecker that has a uniformly brown, unmarked\r\nback and crown, and lower parts thickly spotted with black; the adult\r\nmale has a red patch on the nape, and young birds of both sexes have\r\nmore or less red in the crown, less in the female than in the male.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--This woodpecker is a permanent resident in southern Arizona,\r\nmoving down from the higher parts of the mountains to the lower levels\r\nin winter. Mr. Swarth (1904) says that “in the winter they seem to more\r\nparticularly favor the large groves of live-oaks along the foot-hills\r\nand at the mouths of the canyons; scattering over the mountains and\r\nascending to rather a higher elevation upon the advent of the breeding\r\nseason.” W. E. D. Scott (1886) writes: “Rarely have I met with more\r\nthan two in company, and a family, two parents and three young, were\r\nthe most I ever saw associated together. But I frequently met in the\r\nfall a party composed of Arizona jays, California woodpeckers, various\r\nTitmice and Warblers, and a pair of Strickland’s [Arizona] woodpeckers.\r\nThe birds I have met with them appear late in January or early in\r\nFebruary, and are apparently already mated.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Southwestern New Mexico, southeastern Arizona, and western\r\nMexico; nonmigratory.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona woodpecker is found =north= to southeastern Arizona (Canada\r\ndel Oro and the Whetstone Mountains); and southwestern New Mexico\r\n(probably the Animas Mountains and the San Luis Mountains). =East= to\r\nsouthwestern New Mexico (San Luis Mountains); Chihuahua (Cajon Bonito,\r\nColonia Garcia, Temosachic, and Apache); Durango (Metalotes and Arroyo\r\ndel Buey); and Zacatecas (Sierra de Valparaiso). =South= to Zacatecas\r\n(Sierra de Valparaiso) and Jalisco (Nevada Volcanoe, Colima Volcanoe,\r\nTonila, and San Marcos.) =West= to Jalisco (San Marcos and Bolanos);\r\neastern Sinaloa (Sierra de Choix); central Sonora (La Chumata mine\r\nand Saric); and southeastern Arizona (Huachuca Mountains, Santa Rita\r\nMountains; Rincon Mountains Pantano, and Canada del Oro).\r\n\r\nThe range as outlined is for the entire species, which has been\r\ndivided into two geographic races, the true Arizona woodpecker (_D.\r\na. arizonae_), occupying the northern part of the area south to\r\nnorthwestern Durango, and the Colima woodpecker (_D. a. fraterculus_),\r\noccupying the rest of the range in Mexico.\r\n\r\n_Egg dates._--Arizona: 8 records, April 20 to May 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             DRYOBATES ALBOLARVATUS ALBOLARVATUS (Cassin)\r\n\r\n                   NORTHERN WHITE-HEADED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                            PLATES 13, 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe northern race of the white-headed woodpecker is found in the\r\nCascade Mountains and the Sierra Nevada, from Washington to Kern\r\nCounty, Calif., and eastward into western Idaho and western Nevada.\r\n\r\nIt is a bird of the pine and fir forests in the mountains, ranging from\r\n4,000 to 9,000 feet during the breeding season, but coming down to\r\nlower levels in winter. W. L. Dawson (1923) says: “This woodpecker is\r\nessentially a pine-loving species and is, therefore, nearly confined\r\nto the slopes of the Sierras and the Transition zones of the southern\r\nranges. Only in winter does it appear at lower levels, and then rarely\r\nbeyond the pale of the yellow pine. So close is this devotion of bird\r\nto tree that the woodpecker’s feathers are almost always smeared with\r\npine pitch; and I have found eggs dotted with pitch and soiled to\r\nblackness by contact with the sitting bird.”\r\n\r\nClarence F. Smith writes to me that he found this woodpecker very\r\ncommon around a camp where he was located from June 25 to July 10,\r\n1935, in Tuolumne County, Calif., in the Transition Zone at an\r\nelevation of about 4,000 feet. The camp was at one time a lumbering\r\nmill, and there was much dead standing timber nearby. Most of the trees\r\nwere _Pinus ponderosa_ and _Pinus lambertiana_.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The same observer says in his notes: “All the nests\r\nobserved, except one in a _Quercus kelloggii_, were in dead standing\r\nstumps of the pines. The stumps were mostly some 12 to 15 feet in\r\nheight, and the nests averaged about 8 feet above ground, with an\r\napproximate minimum of 6 feet. These nests may not represent a typical\r\nsituation, as they were undoubtedly the ones that were most obvious to\r\ncasual observation. Nests in higher locations would more easily escape\r\nnotice. We had at least 8 nests within a half-mile radius of camp\r\nheadquarters, and the birds were one of the commonest species in the\r\nvicinity. None of the nests opened contained any lining but chips of\r\nwood, and the cavities were about 14 inches in depth. None of the nest\r\ntrees were less than 2 feet in diameter at the point where the nest was\r\nlocated. Many of the stumps had several holes in them, some of which\r\nhad been nests in previous years, and some of which had been merely\r\nabortive attempts at drilling. The one nest in the oak, referred to\r\nabove, was in a live tree with a decayed heart.”\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) writes:\r\n\r\n     Nidification usually begins about the middle of May and\r\n     continues through June. The sexes relieve each other in the\r\n     preparation of the nesting site, which is usually located\r\n     in a dead stub of a pine or fir; one that is partly decayed\r\n     seems to be preferred as it rarely excavates one in solid,\r\n     hard wood. The nesting sites are seldom situated over 15\r\n     feet from the ground, and sometimes as low as 2 feet. The\r\n     entrance hole is about 1½ inches wide, perfectly circular,\r\n     and just large enough to admit the bird; the inner cavity\r\n     gradually widens towards the bottom, and is usually from 8\r\n     to 12 inches deep, the eggs lying on a slight layer of fine\r\n     chips, in which they become well embedded as incubation\r\n     advances. Occasionally a rather peculiar site is selected.\r\n     Mr. Charles A. Allen found a nest of this species in a post\r\n     in one of the snow sheds on the Central Pacific Railroad,\r\n     between Blue Canyon and Emigrant Gap, about 40 feet from\r\n     the entrance of the shed, and some thirty trains passed\r\n     daily within a few feet of the nest, which contained six\r\n     eggs when found.\r\n\r\nMilton P. Skinner sends me the following notes on nest building by this\r\nwoodpecker: “On May 10, 1933, I found one at work on a hole in a stub\r\nof a tree, about 3 feet above ground. Although this was in the Sequoia\r\nNational Park beside one of the most used paths, it was deepening\r\nthe hole for a nest. Chips were scattered on the ground below. After\r\npecking a while, the woodpecker would get into the hole and soon after\r\nback out again with a billful of chips. It then opened its bill and\r\nlet them scatter to the ground; then back to work again. Although this\r\nwas as public a place as could be found, and though the birds must\r\nfrequently have been disturbed by the crowds of people and were within\r\nreach of hundreds of children, they succeeded in raising their brood of\r\nyoung. In spite of nesting so low, most of these birds are usually seen\r\nfrom 20 to 50 feet, and sometimes as high as 100 feet, above ground,\r\nworking on the trees.”\r\n\r\nOf ten nests found by Grinnell and Storer (1924) in the Yosemite\r\nregion--\r\n\r\n     the lowest was located only 58 inches (measured) above\r\n     ground and the highest, 15 feet (estimated). * * * No nest\r\n     holes of this woodpecker were found in living conifers.\r\n     Nor, on the other hand, do the birds seek what is commonly\r\n     known as rotten wood, that is, wood too soft for the nest\r\n     cavity to be maintained against the incessant wear involved\r\n     in the birds’ passage back and forth, incident to the\r\n     rearing of a brood. The tree chosen must have been dead a\r\n     sufficient length of time for the pitch to have hardened or\r\n     to have descended to the base of the tree, and the outer\r\n     shell of the tree must still be hard and firm, whereas the\r\n     interior must have been softened to a moderate degree by\r\n     decay. These conditions are not to be met with in every\r\n     standing dead stub; hence the choice of a nest site becomes\r\n     a matter of rather fine discrimination.\r\n\r\nThey found plenty of evidence of this discrimination in the many\r\nunfinished nesting holes of varying depths that had been abandoned,\r\noften several in the same stub. “Some stubs are literally riddled with\r\nholes, these probably recording successive years of occupancy. One stub\r\nhad at least 5 fully excavated holes besides 11 or more prospects.\r\n* * * We were led to conclude from all this that the White-headed\r\nWoodpecker is either notional or else very particular, in the selection\r\nof its home. Evidence points strongly to the birds excavating and\r\noccupying a new cavity each year, although one set of eggs was found in\r\na hole which had been dug in earlier years.”\r\n\r\nThey made a number of careful measurements of four nests, at heights\r\nvarying from about 5 feet to about 10 feet above ground; the internal\r\ndimensions varied somewhat, but the size of the entrance hole was\r\n“surprisingly constant”; in one case this hole was a perfect circle,\r\n43 by 43 millimeters, and in another 37 by 37 millimeters; in the\r\nother two cases the entrance hole measured 47 millimeters in height\r\nand 42 in width; translated into inches this shows a variation in the\r\ntwo dimensions of from 1.45 to 1.85 inches, which does not seem to be\r\n“surprisingly constant.” The total depth of the cavity varied from 275\r\nto 400 millimeters, or from about 10 to 15 inches.\r\n\r\nThey say further: “Two of the nest cavities we found were in such\r\nunusual sites as to call forth comment. One at Hazel Green was in a\r\nslanting upright limb on a prostrate dead black oak trunk lying in a\r\ngrassy meadow, fully 150 feet from the margin of the forest. The hole\r\nwas excavated on the lower side of the stub. The other nest was at\r\nTamarack Flat, in the butt end of an old log, lifted above the ground\r\nwhen the tree fell over a granite outcrop. This hole was about 7½ feet\r\nabove the ground, and as with the other there were piles of chips\r\nimmediately beneath it.”\r\n\r\nGrinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale (1930) mention a nest they found in\r\nthe Lassen Peak region that was “four meters up in the trunk of a\r\ndead-topped aspen.” Bendire (1895) mentions a nest found near Camp\r\nHarney, Oreg., that was about 25 feet from the ground in a dead limb\r\nof a pine; this nest seems to be at about the limit as to height above\r\nground. A set in my collection was taken from a nest 10 feet up in a\r\ndead aspen.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The white-headed woodpecker lays three to seven eggs, four\r\nbeing the commonest number, and five rather often. These vary in shape\r\nfrom ovate to short-ovate. They are pure white and moderately or quite\r\nglossy. Grinnell and Storer (1924) say: “The eggs in one set had a\r\nwrinkled appearance at the smaller end as though that end had been\r\ncompressed before the shells had hardened. Eggs which are advanced in\r\nincubation are apt to be soiled by pitch; this is doubtless brought\r\nin by the parent birds on their bills, feet, or plumage.” Sometimes\r\nthe eggs show tiny black dots, or are profusely smeared with black\r\nfrom the same cause. The measurements of 50 eggs average 24.26 by\r\n18.11 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =26.40=\r\nby 18.29, 25.40 by =19.50=, =21.84= by 17.78, and 22.86 by =16.76=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Incubation is said to last for 14 days and to be shared by\r\nboth sexes. Both parents also assist in the care and feeding of the\r\nyoung. Clarence F. Smith tells me that “the female at one nest made\r\ntrips about twice as frequently as the male; her visits were about two\r\nminutes apart, while the visits of the male were about five minutes.”\r\nGrinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale (1930) write:\r\n\r\n     On July 1, the young woodpeckers, by this time half-grown,\r\n     were being fed by the parents, mostly by the female. Food\r\n     was brought at intervals averaging fifteen minutes each.\r\n     The birds foraged at distances up to a quarter of a mile\r\n     away from the nest. The female carried away the feces.\r\n\r\n     On July 11 the female seemed to be coaxing the young from\r\n     this nest. When the young woodpeckers stuck their heads out\r\n     of the cavity, the parent would move away from the entrance\r\n     and call, although it remained on the tree trunk. When\r\n     a person shook the stub two of the young birds flew out\r\n     and went thirty meters before coming to the ground. When\r\n     placed on a tree trunk the birds could move freely upward\r\n     or downward. Within a few minutes one of the young birds\r\n     could fly so well that it successfully evaded capture by\r\n     the observer.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--As with other woodpeckers, the young are hatched naked\r\nand blind, but the juvenal plumage is acquired before the young bird\r\nleaves the nest. The juvenal plumage is much like that of the adult\r\nbut duller, and the bill is shorter and weaker; the contour plumage is\r\nsofter and looser; the lower parts are brownish black instead of clear\r\nblack, and the back is only a little darker; the white in the primaries\r\nis more restricted. In the young male, the posterior half of the crown\r\nis largely “vermilion” or “salmon orange”; these reddish colors are\r\nmuch reduced or entirely absent in the young female. Ridgway (1914)\r\nsays that the feathers of the hind neck and underparts are sometimes,\r\nperhaps on younger birds than I have seen, “indistinctly and narrowly\r\nmargined at tip with grayish, and the hindneck sometimes indistinctly\r\nspotted with whitish.” By the middle of September this juvenal plumage,\r\nincluding the wings and tail, has been replaced by the first winter\r\nplumage, which is like that of the adult, except for somewhat less\r\nwhite in the primaries. Adults have a complete annual molt, which\r\nbegins in July and is generally completed before the end of September.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The white-headed woodpecker forages for its food mainly, if\r\nnot entirely, on the trunks and branches of coniferous trees, living\r\nor dead. Mr. Skinner writes to me that he has seen it feeding on the\r\ntrunks of sequoias, sugar pines, and Douglas firs, searching most\r\ndiligently and thoroughly in the crevices in the bark for insects and\r\ntheir eggs; it generally begins low down on the tree and progresses\r\nupward, working pretty well up to the top of the tree before flying\r\noff; occasionally, one has worked horizontally around a tree trunk, but\r\nnot downward. Dr. J. C. Merrill (1888) describes its method of feeding\r\nvery well, as follows:\r\n\r\n     So far as I have observed, and during the winter I watched\r\n     it carefully, its principal supply of food is obtained\r\n     in the bark, most of the pines having a very rough bark,\r\n     scaly and deeply fissured. The bird uses its bill as\r\n     a crowbar rather than as a hammer or chisel, _prying_\r\n     off the successive scales and layers of bark in a very\r\n     characteristic way. This explains the fact of its being\r\n     such a quiet worker, and as would be expected it is most\r\n     often seen near the base of the tree where the bark is\r\n     thickest and roughest.\r\n\r\n     It must destroy immense numbers of Scolytidae, whose larvae\r\n     tunnel the bark so extensively, and of other insects that\r\n     crawl beneath the scales of bark for shelter during winter.\r\n     I have several times imitated the work of this bird by\r\n     prying off the successive layers of bark, and have been\r\n     astonished at the great numbers of insects, and especially\r\n     of spiders, so exposed.\r\n\r\nProf. F. E. L. Beal (1911) examined only 14 stomachs, but says that\r\n“half of the animal food of the white-headed woodpecker (_Xenopicus\r\nalbolarvatus_) is ants, but the most pronounced characteristic of this\r\nbird is its fondness for the seeds of pines, which constitute more than\r\nhalf of the food.”\r\n\r\nGrinnell and Storer (1924) say: “Stomachs of two adult birds, obtained\r\nat Merced Grove Big Trees on June 10, 1915, and at East Fork of\r\nIndian Cañon, June 24, 1915, both held ants, some of which were large\r\ncarpenter ants. The stomach of one of the young birds from the nest\r\nmentioned above contained remains of 2 large spiders, a large ant, 2\r\nboring beetles, and a whole fly larva.”\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) quotes Rollo H. Beck as saying: “I noticed one\r\nof these birds on some fallen logs near the road, busily engaged in\r\ncatching spiders, searching for grubs, and frequently flying after\r\npassing insects, catching them in mid-air in the manner of the\r\nCalifornia Woodpecker.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Dr. Merrill (1888) writes: “Though not shy, and with care\r\ngenerally approachable to within a short distance, it is watchful and\r\nsuspicious, and seems to know very well what is going on even if it\r\ndoes not see fit to fly away, though it is more apt to do this than\r\nto dodge around the trunk. The flight is direct, and rather slow\r\nand heavy.” Dr. Merrill noted that the skull of the white-headed\r\nwoodpecker is “noticeably less hard and dense” than the skulls of\r\nother woodpeckers; this is probably due to the fact that its method of\r\nfeeding requires less heavy drilling into hard wood.\r\n\r\nMrs. Florence M. Bailey (1902) says: “_Xenopicus_ works with apparent\r\nindifference on trunks or branches. Like the Nuttall woodpecker he\r\noften lights upside down. In hunting over the bark he easily backs\r\ndown the trunk, or if he takes the notion will fly, or perhaps drop\r\nbackwards, a foot or so. He will also light sidewise on a branch and\r\ngrasp the limb with his tail as if afraid of falling off. It is\r\ninteresting to see him explore cracks in the bark. Standing on the edge\r\nhe pokes his head into the dark cavern, turning it from one side to the\r\nother inquiringly.”\r\n\r\nGrinnell and Storer (1924) write:\r\n\r\n     At Tamarack Flat, on May 26, 1919, a female white-headed\r\n     woodpecker was seen to flush from her nest about ten feet\r\n     above ground in a dead pine stub. Tapping by one of us on\r\n     a nearby hole had caused her to leave, but she returned\r\n     to the vicinity almost immediately. Then, for fully 25\r\n     minutes, while the observer remained within watching\r\n     distance the bird foraged, preened, and flew about from one\r\n     to another of the circle of 8 or 10 trees within a 50-foot\r\n     radius of the nest, but always kept the nest tree in her\r\n     sight. About every 5 minutes she would fly to the nest. In\r\n     approaching it, she would swoop below its level and then\r\n     glide up to the site with decreasing speed so as to end\r\n     her flight with little or no momentum. Then, having gained\r\n     claw-hold, she would poke the fore part of her body into\r\n     the hole, withdraw it at once and repeat this performance\r\n     four or five times before flying away again. Finally, after\r\n     fully half an hour had elapsed, and her suspicions had been\r\n     allayed, she went in, to remain. During this entire time\r\n     the male kept out of sight and was heard only twice.\r\n\r\nVan Rossem and Pierce (1915) noted its manner of drinking, thus:\r\n“White-headed woodpeckers were often observed to drink at a small\r\nstream near our camp at Bear Lake, where a pine sapling grew from the\r\nedge of a small pool. On this sapling the birds would alight, usually\r\nabout three feet from the base, ‘hitch’ quickly backwards down the\r\ntrunk to the water, and, leaning sharply to one side, drink by quick,\r\nnervous dips.”\r\n\r\nAnother method of drinking is described by Grinnell, Dixon, and\r\nLinsdale (1930), as follows: “In mid-afternoon one flew down from a\r\nyellow pine to some shallow, running water in an open roadside near\r\nMineral. It alighted in a horizontal position on the ground and dipped\r\nits bill into the water six times. After each dip the bird raised its\r\nbill skyward at an angle of fully eighty degrees from the horizontal.\r\nAfter drinking, the bird flew to a prostrate log, and foraged\r\nhorizontally along its lower curvature.”\r\n\r\nSome observers seem to think that the white-headed woodpecker rarely,\r\nif ever, drums on tree trunks, but seeks its food more quietly; but\r\nAlexander Sprunt, Jr., tells me that the birds he saw in Oregon\r\n“drummed and beat upon the tree trunks and telephone poles at the\r\nroadside, exactly as any other woodpecker.” Clarence F. Smith writes to\r\nme that “one male bird was a regular overnight guest, hanging to the\r\nridgepole of our cabin, outside the wall, just beneath the eaves. He\r\nnever made any attempt to drill the wood there.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Grinnell and Storer (1924) say that “the usual call note of\r\nthis woodpecker is a single _wiek_, but when excited, the female calls\r\n_cheep-eep-eep-eep_, very fast, and repeats the call every few seconds.\r\nThe male, under similar circumstances calls _yip, yip, yip, yip_, in\r\na much shriller tone, but in slower time.” Mr. Dawson (1923) once\r\nheard “a double or treble call-note, _chick-up_ or _chick-it-up_, which\r\nreminded me somewhat of the Cabanis’s cry.” Major Bendire (1895) heard\r\nit utter “a sharp, clear _witt-witt_” as it passed from one tree to\r\nanother; he considered it a rather silent bird.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The white-headed woodpecker could hardly be mistaken\r\nfor any other bird. It is the only woodpecker with a wholly black\r\nbody and a wholly white head; while perched it shows a long white\r\nstripe in the wing, and while flying a large white patch in the wing\r\nis conspicuous; the narrow red band on the nape is not conspicuous\r\nand can be seen only at short range and only in the adult male; young\r\nbirds show more or less red in the crown. One would think that such a\r\nstrikingly marked bird would be very conspicuous, but such is not the\r\ncase; its coloration is, in fact, somewhat concealing in its chosen\r\nenvironment; its quiet behavior helps to make it less obvious. For\r\nexample, Dr. Merrill (1888) writes: “On most of the pines in this\r\nvicinity there are many short stubs of small broken branches projecting\r\nan inch or two from the main trunk. When the sun is shining these\r\nprojections are lighted up in such a manner as to appear quite white\r\nat a little distance, and they often cast a shadow exactly resembling\r\nthe black body of the bird. In winter when a little snow has lodged on\r\nthese stubs the resemblance is even greater, and almost daily I was\r\nmisled by this deceptive appearance, either mistaking the stub for a\r\nbird or the reverse.”\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Grinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale (1930) state that “it was\r\nfurther observed that in usual pose, either when foraging or when in\r\ndigging or inspecting a nest hole, the whole back of a bird (either\r\nsex) appeared to a nearby observer solidly black, clear to the top\r\nof the head. The white showed only as a very narrow rim or border\r\nanteriorly around the black of the head. * * * At the same time the\r\nconcealing black of the bird’s dorsal surface must cover all of the\r\narea of the bird exposed to the view of the potentially inimical\r\nobserver at more or less distance.”\r\n\r\nAnd again, Mrs. Bailey (1902) says:\r\n\r\n     Impossible as it would seem at first sight, I have found\r\n     that the snow-white head often serves the bird as a\r\n     disguise. It is the disguise of color pattern, for the\r\n     black body seen against a tree trunk becomes one of the\r\n     black streaks or shadows of the bark, and the white head\r\n     is cut off as a detached white spot without bird-like\r\n     suggestions. On the other hand, when the bird is exploring\r\n     the light-barked young Shasta firs or gray, barkless tracts\r\n     of old trees, the white of the head tones in with the gray\r\n     and is lost, the headless back again becoming only a shadow\r\n     or scar. But the most surprising thing of all is to see the\r\n     sun streaming full on the white head and find that the bird\r\n     form is lost. The white in this case is so glaring that it\r\n     fills the eye and carries it over to the light streaks on\r\n     the bark, making the black sink away as insignificant.\r\n\r\nThe activities of this and other woodpeckers play an important role\r\nin the welfare of the forests and the lives of the little furred\r\nand feathered denizens of the woods. It is a well-known fact that\r\nwoodpeckers are most useful in guarding the living trees and destroying\r\nthe insect pests that injure them; but Grinnell and Storer (1924) have\r\ncalled our attention to the fact that woodpeckers in general, and the\r\nwhite-headed woodpecker in particular, contribute, by their excessive\r\ndrilling of nest holes, “rather directly toward bringing down the\r\nstanding dead timber.” They continue:\r\n\r\n     Drilling by woodpeckers results in an increase in the\r\n     number of entrances through which insects may get at\r\n     the heart wood of a tree and thus hasten its ultimate\r\n     disintegration. Water, also, is thus afforded an easier\r\n     entrance and this hastens decay. Eventually each and every\r\n     tree must yield its place in the forest to seedlings. The\r\n     woodpeckers hasten this process of replacement, once the\r\n     tree is dead.\r\n\r\n     Many of the wood-inhabiting animals depend upon this\r\n     woodpecker to furnish them convenient nest holes\r\n     or retreats. We have found mountain chickadees and\r\n     slender-billed nuthatches incubating their own eggs\r\n     in holes drilled in earlier years by the white-headed\r\n     woodpecker; a Sierra flying squirrel was found occupying an\r\n     old white-head’s hole. Probably, tree-dwelling chipmunks\r\n     and perhaps California pigmy owls also occupy holes of this\r\n     woodpecker.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Pacific coast of the United States; occurring rarely in\r\nsouthern British Columbia; nonmigratory.\r\n\r\nThe range of the white-headed woodpecker extends =north= to Washington\r\n(Methow River and probably Fort Colville); and northern Idaho (Fort\r\nSherman). =East= to western Idaho (Fort Sherman and Grangeville);\r\neastern Oregon (Hurricane Creek, Powder River Mountains, Anthony, and\r\nCamp Harney); western Nevada (Carson); and eastern California (Bijou,\r\nYosemite Valley, Pyramid Peak, San Bernardino Mountains, and Cuyamaca\r\nMountains). =South= to southern California (Cuyamaca Mountains and\r\nMount Pinos). =West= to the western slopes of the Sierra Nevadas,\r\nCalif. (Mount Pinos, Bear Valley, Fyffe, Butte Lake, and Mount Shasta);\r\nwestern Oregon (Pinehurst, Foley Creek, and The Dalles); and western\r\nWashington (Kalama, Cle Elum, and Methow River).\r\n\r\nThe species has been separated into two subspecies, the northern\r\nwhite-headed woodpecker (_Dryobates a. albolarvatus_), occupying most\r\nof the range south to the southern end of the Sierra Nevadas, and the\r\nsouthern white-headed woodpecker (_D. a. gravirostris_), found in the\r\nmountain ranges of southern California.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--A specimen collected near Point Bonita, Marin\r\nCounty, Calif., on July 20, 1932, is the only coastal record in that\r\nState. There is, however, an old record for Grays Harbor, Wash.\r\n(previous to 1892), which cannot now be confirmed.\r\n\r\nIn the Provincial Museum at Victoria, British Columbia, there is an\r\nunlabeled specimen said to have been collected in the Similkameen\r\nValley. Two have been collected at Okanagan, British Columbia, one on\r\nDecember 20, 1911, and the other on January 24, 1914.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--California: 53 records, April 24 to June 16; 27 records,\r\n    May 22 to June 7, indicating the height of the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            DRYOBATES ALBOLARVATUS GRAVIROSTRIS (Grinnell)\r\n\r\n                   SOUTHERN WHITE-HEADED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph Grinnell (1902), in describing and naming the white-headed\r\nwoodpecker of the mountain ranges of southern California, gave as its\r\ncharacters: “Similar to _Xenopicus albolarvatus_ but bill much heavier,\r\nand size in general slightly greater.” He named it as a distinct\r\nspecies, on the theory that “the material at hand does not justify\r\nsubspecific treatment of these two forms. Geographical continuity of\r\nranges possibly exists; but it seems quite as likely that there is a\r\nbroad hiatus in the vicinity of Tehachapi Pass, whence I can find no\r\nrecord of the white-headed woodpecker.”\r\n\r\nThe range of this form includes the San Gabriel, San Bernardino, San\r\nJacinto, Santa Rosa, and Cuyamaca Mountains in southern California.\r\nDr. Grinnell (1908) found this woodpecker rather scarce in the San\r\nBernardino Mountains, and says: “They were seen only in the Transition\r\nzone, none being observed above the fir belt, and but very few down\r\ninto pure yellow pine tracts. In the vicinity of Fish creek, 6,500\r\nfeet, a few pairs were breeding in June. On July 5, 1905, I found a\r\nnesting hole seven feet up in a dead pine stub, which contained four\r\nhalf-fledged young. We did not see the species anywhere higher than\r\n8,000 feet, except on the south slope of Sugarloaf, where on July 11,\r\n1906, one was seen among the silver firs at about 9,000 feet altitude.\r\nAbout Bluff lake they were more common than anywhere else, and a few\r\nwere seen on the northern slopes of Sugarloaf at about 8,000 feet, in\r\nAugust.”\r\n\r\nW. L. Dawson (1923) writes: “In the San Jacinto Mountains, where these\r\nwhite-heads outnumber all other woodpeckers combined, our attention was\r\ndrawn, on the 6th day of June, by a male who tittered anxiously as we\r\nstumbled along the rough trail. We camped on the prospect immediately,\r\nbut it took a full hour to trace the ‘damage’ to a hole fifty feet up\r\nin a yellow pine stub, which was three feet through at the base. * * *\r\n\r\n“We found a clean-cut round hole, one and a half inches in diameter,\r\nwhich gave admission to a cavity ten inches deep, and which had for its\r\nouter wall only the thick bark of the tree.”\r\n\r\nFrank Stephens wrote to Major Bendire (1895): “_Xenopicus albolarvatus_\r\nis a resident of the pine regions of southern California, but is not\r\ncommon excepting possibly in a few localities. I have never observed\r\nit below the pines. I have taken incubating birds in June in the\r\nCuyamaca Mountains at altitudes of about 7,000 feet. The nesting sites\r\nhere were in very large dead pine trees and inaccessible.”\r\n\r\nThis woodpecker seems to show a tendency to nest, at least\r\noccasionally, at greater heights above ground than its northern\r\nrelative, but otherwise its habits seem to be very similar.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are similar to those of the northern race. The measurements of\r\n20 eggs average 24.67 by 18.60 millimeters; the eggs showing the four\r\nextremes measure =26.70= by 19.50, 25.60 by =19.70=, and =22.62= by\r\n=16.67= millimeters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PICOÏDES ARCTICUS (Swainson)\r\n\r\n                     ARCTIC THREE-TOED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                             PLATES 15, 16\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nAlthough not found in the strictly Arctic, treeless regions, this bird\r\nis probably well named, for its range as a whole averages farther north\r\nthan that of any other woodpecker except _P. tridactylus_. It is a bird\r\nof the boreal forests of spruces and firs, ranging as far north in\r\nAlaska and northern Canada as these trees grow, and extending its range\r\nsouthward throughout the Canadian Zone into the Northern United States\r\nand farther southward in some of the higher mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern portion of its range this woodpecker seems to prefer the\r\ndense virgin forests of spruces and balsam fir, but it nests mainly\r\nin the more open windfalls or burned-over clearings where there are\r\nplenty of dead, standing trees in which to excavate its nest. In New\r\nYork State, near the southern limit of its breeding range, a typical\r\nlocality is thus described by Laurence Achilles (1906): “At three\r\nthousand feet or more above the sea, in the denser spruce and balsam\r\nforests of the Adirondacks, the Arctic three-toed woodpecker is fairly\r\ncommon. * * *\r\n\r\n“The trees near the nest were chiefly spruces, with a few balsams and\r\nbirches scattered among them. The birds had selected a rather open\r\nplace for their nesting-site, as, within a radius of ten yards from\r\ntheir nest, there were several windfalls and dead spruces. The ground\r\nwas carpeted with moss, while linnea, clintonia, wood-sorrel and\r\nbunchberry were blossoming in profusion near the base of the tree.”\r\n\r\nIn the Midwestern States and Provinces, the Arctic three-toed shows a\r\ndecided preference for tamarack swamps, especially where these have\r\nbeen burned over, leaving a few dead or dying trees still standing;\r\nthese trees not only furnish an abundant food supply but offer many\r\nconvenient nesting sites. Into such attractive habitats these birds\r\nsometimes congregate to form small breeding colonies.\r\n\r\nThe Weydemeyers (1928) say that in northwestern Montana this woodpecker\r\n“is found most frequently in Transition zone woods that have been\r\nlogged or burned over. In virgin forests it occurs sparingly in yellow\r\npine woods at low elevations; more commonly in mixed broad-leaf and\r\nconifer, and Douglas fir, associations; and rarely in alpine fir and\r\nlodgepole pine woods of the higher mountains, in the Canadian zone. Its\r\nfavorite feeding trees are Douglas fir and western larch.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Philipp and Bowdish (1919) found four or five nests of the\r\nArctic three-toed woodpecker in Northumberland County, New Brunswick,\r\nin May and June 1917. Most of the nests were in living balsam firs with\r\ndead hearts, but one was “in a dead maple stub, near the edge of a\r\nlarge burnt barren, and a short distance from the edge of mixed woods.”\r\nThis was “at a height of about ten feet. The cavity measured 10½ inches\r\nfrom the lower edge of entrance to bottom. The entrance measured 1⅝\r\ninches in height and 1¾ inches in width.” They say that--\r\n\r\n     apparently nest sites are selected indiscriminately, in\r\n     dead stubs in open cleared ground or burnt barrens, and\r\n     in the woods, where nests are often in dead-hearted live\r\n     trees. The birds have a remarkably strong attachment for\r\n     their nests, as evidenced by re-laying in nest holes\r\n     from which eggs had been removed, and their disregard of\r\n     the immediate presence of intruders. The male evidently\r\n     performs his share of the work of incubation, as well as\r\n     care of young. New nest holes are apparently dug each year,\r\n     and these may not be in the immediate vicinity of nests of\r\n     the previous year. The site selected tends to be low, only\r\n     one nest having been noted at a height of over ten feet,\r\n     while one, as noted, was as low as two feet. Entrances to\r\n     nest holes are strongly beveled at the lower edge, forming\r\n     a sort of “door-step,” and more or less at sides and even\r\n     top. While this is true in some cases with the Northern\r\n     Hairy and some other woodpecker excavations which we have\r\n     examined, it has not proved so frequent or pronounced. With\r\n     experience, one can usually identify the nest hole of this\r\n     species with comparative certainty, by this one feature.\r\n\r\nDr. Harrison F. Lewis watched a pair of these woodpeckers excavating\r\ntheir nesting hole on May 27, 1936, in some second-growth woods,\r\nchiefly spruce and fir, in Saguenay County, Quebec; he says in his\r\nnotes: “The Arctic three-toed woodpeckers had a partly excavated nest\r\ncavity at a height of about 14 feet on the northwest side of a dead\r\nbirch stub in a clearing. The stub was about 20 feet high and 1 foot\r\nin diameter and stood about 10 feet from the border of the clearing.\r\nThe nest cavity was guarded almost continually by one bird of the\r\npair. The bird on guard clung to the lower edge of the opening of this\r\ncavity. Nine other woodpecker-made openings, many of them only partly\r\ncompleted, were to be seen in the same stub.\r\n\r\n“I watched the three-toed woodpeckers, from partial concealment near\r\nat hand, for an hour and 25 minutes. Each one of them would spend a\r\nperiod of 15 to 20 minutes at their nest cavity, then be relieved by\r\nthe other. The periods spent at the cavity by the male were somewhat\r\nlonger than those spent there by the female. While the male was at\r\nthe cavity, he spent much of his time in excavating, with only his\r\ntail and the region of his rump projecting from the opening, but at\r\nintervals of a few seconds he would withdraw his body and head from the\r\ncavity and look about him. When he was excavating, very little noise\r\ncould be heard. He spent some time in throwing out chips and some time\r\nin resting. When the female was at the cavity, she did very little\r\nexcavating, so little that it seemed to be a mere gesture. On one\r\noccasion, after she had been clinging to the edge of the opening for 10\r\nminutes, she drummed repeatedly, but not loudly, on the outside of the\r\nstub beside the opening. I wondered if she were signaling to the male\r\nto come to relieve her in guarding the cavity. After 5 minutes of such\r\nintermittent drumming, she was relieved at the opening by the male.”\r\n\r\nMr. Achilles (1906) describes the nest he found in the Adirondacks as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     The hole, which was in a spruce tree, faced north by\r\n     northeast, and was twenty-seven feet one inch from the\r\n     ground. The spruce retained all its branches and some\r\n     twigs, although it had been dead for some time.\r\n\r\n     The following dimensions of the hole were taken after the\r\n     young had left their nest. The entrance to the hole was\r\n     two inches wide and one and five-eighths inches high. From\r\n     the outside of the hole, straight through over the top of\r\n     the nest to the back of the hole, the measurement was five\r\n     and three-fourths inches. The outside shell, including the\r\n     bark, was one and three-fourths inches thick. The diameter\r\n     of the nest opening was three and one-fourth inches, while\r\n     the diameter of the hole on the inside at the bottom of the\r\n     shaft, was four and five-eighths inches. The depth of the\r\n     hole was nine and one-eighth inches.\r\n\r\nDr. C. Hart Merriam sent Major Bendire (1895) some notes on two nests\r\nthat he found in the Adirondacks, as follows:\r\n\r\n     The water of Seventh Lake, Fulton Chain, had been raised by\r\n     a dam at the foot of Sixth Lake, flooding a considerable\r\n     area along the inlet, and the trees killed by the overflow\r\n     stood in about 6 feet of water. In 1883 the place was\r\n     first visited by me, May 27. Both species of Three-toed\r\n     Woodpeckers (_Picoides americanus_ and _arcticus_) were\r\n     tolerably common, and one new nest of each was found.\r\n     That of _P. arcticus_ contained one fresh egg. The nest\r\n     was 10 inches deep, and the opening within 5 feet of the\r\n     surface of the water. It was in a dead spruce, 10 inches\r\n     in diameter. * * * The place was next visited, June 2, but\r\n     the date proved still too early. Several unfinished nests\r\n     of _P. americanus_ were found, and one completed nest with\r\n     four fresh eggs of _P. arcticus_. Like the one found on my\r\n     first visit, it was in a dead spruce and about 5 feet above\r\n     the water. The nest was 11 inches deep and the orifice 1¾\r\n     inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nJ. H. Fleming (1901) says that the Arctic three-toed woodpecker is\r\n“a common resident in Parry Sound, rarer in Muskoka. This Woodpecker\r\nhas a habit of sometimes nesting in colonies. I saw the nests of such\r\na colony near Sand Lake in 1896; there were six or seven nests, each\r\ncut into the trunk of a living cedar, just below the first branch, and\r\nusually eight or ten feet from the ground. The cedars were in a dense\r\nforest, overlooking a small stream that empties into Sand Lake.”\r\n\r\nMacoun (1909) reports, on the authority of Spreadborough, that “a pair\r\nnested in a telegraph pole quite near Cache lake station of the Parry\r\nSound railway.” Major Bendire (1895) writes:\r\n\r\n     On May 10, 1883, while en route from Fort Klamath to\r\n     Linkville, Oregon, and only a few miles from the latter\r\n     place, just where the pine timber ended and the sagebrush\r\n     commenced, I found a male busily at work on a pine stump,\r\n     only about 2½ feet high and about 18 inches in diameter,\r\n     standing within a few feet of the road, and close to a\r\n     charcoal burner’s camp, in quite an open and exposed\r\n     situation, nearly all the timber in the vicinity having\r\n     been cut down. The stump was solid, full of pitch, and\r\n     showed no signs of decay; the entrance hole was about 1½\r\n     inches in diameter and 8 inches from the top. The cavity,\r\n     when first examined, was only about 2 inches deep, and\r\n     on my return, two days later, it had reached a depth of\r\n     4 inches: the female was then at work. To make sure of a\r\n     full set of eggs, I waited until the 25th. The cavity then\r\n     was found to be 18 inches deep, and was gradually enlarged\r\n     toward the bottom. The four eggs it contained had been\r\n     incubated about four days. The female was on the nest, and\r\n     uttered a hissing sound as she left it, and might easily\r\n     have been caught, as she remained in the hole until the\r\n     stump was struck with a hatchet. The sides of the cavity\r\n     were quite smooth, and the eggs were partly embedded in a\r\n     slight layer of pine chips. The locality where this nest\r\n     was found was near the top of a low divide, not over 4,100\r\n     feet in altitude.\r\n\r\nDr. Thomas S. Roberts (1932) calls attention to an interesting feature\r\nin the nesting habits of this woodpecker, as observed in two nestings\r\nthat he saw in Minnesota; he says of the two nests:\r\n\r\n     The nesting-hole was in a live jack-pine on the edge of a\r\n     tamarack and spruce swamp, only twenty feet from a traveled\r\n     road and close by a log house used as a store. The entrance\r\n     faced south and was twelve feet from the ground, at which\r\n     point the tree was seven inches in diameter. The outer bark\r\n     of the tree had been chipped off for a distance of twelve\r\n     to fifteen inches above and below the hole and half-way\r\n     around the tree, thus leaving a large, irregular, whitish\r\n     area. * * *\r\n\r\n     Another nest, found the same season, was also in a live\r\n     evergreen tree and the outer bark had been similarly\r\n     stripped from around the entrance, making a conspicuous,\r\n     white patch with the dark nesting-hole in the center. Can\r\n     this be a direction mark for the returning bird among the\r\n     dark tree trunks around?\r\n\r\nAs to the height from the ground, P. B. Philipp writes to me that of 26\r\nnesting holes examined by him in New Brunswick two were 15 feet, two 12\r\nfeet, three 10 feet, one 8 feet, two 6 feet, two 5 feet, four 4 feet,\r\nsix 3 feet, and four only 2 feet above ground.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Arctic three-toed woodpecker usually nests at no great\r\nheight above ground, there are a few exceptions to this rule, mainly\r\nin the western portion of its range. Grinnell and Storer (1924) record\r\na nest seen in the Yosemite region that was 50 feet above ground in a\r\ndead lodgepole pine. Harry S. Swarth (1924) found, in the Skeena River\r\nregion, the highest nest of which I can find any record; he says: “A\r\nnest of the Arctic three-toed woodpecker was found in Kispiox Valley.\r\nIt was placed in a dead and charred Engelmann spruce, in a strip of\r\nspruce woods bordering a muskeg otherwise surrounded by poplar forest.\r\nThe nest hole was eighty feet from the ground. It was two and one-half\r\ninches in diameter and one foot deep, drilled through an outer sheath\r\nof sound, hard wood, and downward through soft, rotten ‘punk.’”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The number of eggs laid by the Arctic three-toed woodpecker\r\nvaries from two to six, four being the commonest number. These vary\r\nfrom ovate to elliptical-ovate, the former shape prevailing. The shell\r\nis dull or only slightly glossy and is pure white. The measurements of\r\n39 eggs average 21.32 by 18.94 millimeters; the eggs showing the four\r\nextremes measure =25.9= by 18.7, 25.1 by =20.2=, and =22.35= by =17.53=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation is about 14 days; both sexes assist\r\nin this and in the care of the young. Only one brood is raised in a\r\nseason, but if the eggs are taken, a second set will be laid, often in\r\nthe same nest.\r\n\r\nMr. Achilles (1906) watched a nest containing young for 24 consecutive\r\nhours, he and a companion taking turns at the vigil and sleeping\r\nalternately within ten yards of the tree; he writes:\r\n\r\n     The parents, when feeding their young, usually alighted\r\n     within a space of three feet below the hole, and never\r\n     directly at its entrance. They would pause here for a\r\n     moment as though fearing they were observed by someone.\r\n     Then they would hop up to the hole and look in, anywhere\r\n     from two up to six times, as if accustoming their eyes to\r\n     the darkness. Once in a while grubs could be seen in their\r\n     bills, but, from the actions of the birds when feeding\r\n     their young, they appeared to be regurgitating. During\r\n     twenty-four hours the female fed the young thirty times,\r\n     and the male twenty-nine times.\r\n\r\n     As it grew dusk, the young gradually grew quieter, and\r\n     their little “peep-peep-peep” greatly resembled those of\r\n     chicks when crawling beneath their mother’s wings. From two\r\n     o’clock in the afternoon till seven o’clock that evening,\r\n     two minutes was the longest period during which the young\r\n     did not utter a single “peep.” From seven P. M. until\r\n     two minutes after four the next morning, the young birds\r\n     ceased this continuous chattering. The mother was the last\r\n     to feed them at night, the time being seventeen minutes\r\n     after seven; but the male was up first in the morning.\r\n     At four-fifteen in the morning, the young uttered a few\r\n     sleepy “peeps,” and the male alighted three feet below the\r\n     hole at four-sixteen. The young birds heard him alight and\r\n     immediately commenced to chatter. The male hopped up to the\r\n     hole, looked in twice, and then fed them. The young birds’\r\n     bills were seen, indicating that they were very hungry,\r\n     and were hanging on to the inner wall of the nest near the\r\n     entrance. Soon after this their hunger was appeased, their\r\n     bills were seen no more, and the parents had to go almost\r\n     into the hole to feed them.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The nestlings are naked and blind at first, but the\r\njuvenal plumage is acquired before the young leave the nest. In the\r\njuvenal plumage, the young male is similar to the adult male, but the\r\nyellow crown patch is smaller and not so sharply defined; the upper\r\nparts are duller, browner black, lacking the glossy, bluish edgings;\r\nthe breast is tinged with dull buffy white; and the flanks are more\r\nheavily and less distinctly barred or spotted with dull black. The\r\nyoung female is similar to the young male, but there is no distinct\r\nyellow patch on the crown, only scattering yellow feathers in varying\r\namounts, often few or none at all. This plumage is worn through the\r\nsummer and early fall; the first winter plumage, which is practically\r\nindistinguishable from that of the adult, is apparently not fully\r\nacquired until November or December. Adults have one complete annual\r\nmolt, beginning in August.\r\n\r\n_Food._--More than three-quarters of the food of both species of\r\nthree-toed woodpeckers consists of the larvae of wood-boring beetles,\r\nmainly Cerambycidae and Buprestidae. Referring to the former, Prof. F.\r\nE. L. Beal (1911) says:\r\n\r\n     Stomachs containing 15 to 20 of these grubs are very\r\n     common, and one held 34. Probably the stomach is filled\r\n     several times each day, and it does not seem unreasonable\r\n     to assume that a bird will eat 50 of these insects every 24\r\n     hours for 6 months and at least 25 daily for the other half\r\n     of the year. At this rate one bird will annually destroy\r\n     13,675 of these destructive grubs. * * *\r\n\r\n     Probably there are not many other agencies more destructive\r\n     to timber than this family of beetles. Nor is timber safe\r\n     even after it has been cut. Logs lying in the mill yard or\r\n     forest may be ruined in a single season if these creatures\r\n     are not prevented from depositing their eggs. * * * A very\r\n     efficient check upon the undue increase of these insects\r\n     is found in the woodpeckers, especially the two species of\r\n     Picoides.\r\n\r\nWeevils and other beetles and some ants are eaten, as well as a few\r\nother insects and spiders. Vegetable food, wild fruits, mast, and\r\ncambium amount to less than 12 percent of the food.\r\n\r\nWhile with us, in southern New England, in winter, this woodpecker\r\nshows a decided preference for dead white pine trees (_Pinus strobus_),\r\nespecially those that have been killed by fire or have been dead long\r\nenough for the bark to have partially peeled off. An isolated tree or\r\na group of trees of this type may be visited day after day by one of\r\nthese woodpeckers, during its stay, with such regularity that many\r\nan observer, who has never seen an Arctic three-toed woodpecker, may\r\nfeel reasonably sure of finding one in such a place, if it has been\r\npreviously seen there. Its persistent work on such a tree is well\r\ndescribed by E. H. Forbush (1927) as follows:\r\n\r\n     This species very often begins to work on the trunk near\r\n     the foot of a tree; it sounds the bark with direct blows,\r\n     and then, turning its head from side to side, strikes its\r\n     beak slantingly into and under the bark, and flakes it off.\r\n     It often works long on the same tree and barks the whole\r\n     trunk in time, only occasionally working on the branches.\r\n     Thus it exposes channels of bark-beetles and the holes made\r\n     by borers. When the bird remains motionless, it is well\r\n     concealed against the blackened bark of the burnt trees.\r\n     It seems deliberate in its movements and appears to do its\r\n     work thoroughly, as it often remains five to ten minutes\r\n     on the same spot and then shifts only a little distance.\r\n     In early autumn, while the grubs are still at work on the\r\n     tree, it lays its head against the tree, at times, turning\r\n     it first to one side and then to the other as if listening.\r\n\r\nGrinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale (1930) write of the feeding habits of\r\nthis woodpecker in the Lassen Peak region:\r\n\r\n     One of these woodpeckers was watched as it moved slowly\r\n     up a tree trunk. It stopped to knock off a piece of bark\r\n     with a sidewise (glancing) blow of the heavy bill. This\r\n     was repeated several times. Then the bird began to drill\r\n     in earnest and the tapping could be heard by a person\r\n     more than thirty meters distant. The blows were delivered\r\n     rapidly, about two per second. Between three and five\r\n     minutes were required to bore through the bark, in this\r\n     instance twenty millimeters thick. Then after a few moments\r\n     of probing the bill was withdrawn and was seen to hold a\r\n     white larva which was quickly eaten. * * *\r\n\r\n     On one tree thirty-five centimeters in diameter an area of\r\n     bark thirty by sixty centimeters was punctured completely\r\n     through by twenty-two holes each leading to the tunnel\r\n     of a wood-borer. * * * The holes were twelve by twelve\r\n     millimeters across by twenty deep. It appeared to the\r\n     observer * * * that many of the still living trees in that\r\n     locality had been saved from complete destruction by the\r\n     insects, by the activity of this woodpecker.\r\n\r\nManly Hardy wrote to Major Bendire (1895) that, in Maine, “it seems\r\nto feed entirely on such wood worms as attack spruce, pine, and other\r\nsoft-wood timber that has been fire-killed. Specimens are so abundant\r\nin such places that I once shot the heads off of six in a few minutes\r\nwhen short of material for a stew.”\r\n\r\nSome dead pine trees that had been regularly frequented by these\r\nwoodpeckers, on the Kennard estate, were cut down; and the birds,\r\nseeing their favorite trees gone, continued to search for food on the\r\nwood piles made from these trees.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Most observers agree that the Arctic three-toed woodpecker\r\nis very tame and unsuspicious, working very quietly on a tree trunk for\r\nlong periods, without moving about much, and allowing a close approach;\r\nperhaps, as it lives most of its life in remote northern forests, where\r\nmen are scarce, it has not learned to fear human beings. Manly Hardy\r\nconsidered it the tamest and stupidest of the woodpeckers found in\r\nMaine. Major Bendire (1895) says:\r\n\r\n“Like the hairy woodpecker, they are persistent drummers, rattling away\r\nfor minutes at a time on some dead limb, and are especially active\r\nduring the mating season, in April. I have located more than one\r\nspecimen by traveling in the direction of the sound when it was fully\r\nhalf a mile away. * * * Its flight is swift, greatly undulating, and is\r\noften protracted for considerable distances.”\r\n\r\nDr. Lewis says in his notes: “When one bird relieved the other in\r\nguarding the cavity, the bird taking over guard duty flew low toward\r\nthe stub and swerved sharply upward, with widespread tail, to alight\r\nnear the opening.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Dr. Lewis (MS.) records the common cry of this woodpecker as\r\n“_tchuk_, often shortened and sharpened to _kip_.” He also says: “A\r\nmale mounted a stub, about 25 feet from me, and there, in plain view,\r\nscolded me vigorously with a sharp note like _kuk_, repeated about\r\nonce a second for some minutes. Each time the note was uttered there\r\nwas a flash of whitish at the bird’s eye, as though it winked with\r\neach utterance. It was also heard to utter a rattling note, apparently\r\nanother kind of scolding cry.”\r\n\r\nFrancis H. Allen tells me that the “call-note resembles the\r\n_cluck_ used in New England to start a horse; it has a ‘woodeny’\r\nquality.” Ralph Hoffmann (1927) says that “in the breeding season\r\nthe Arctic Three-toed Woodpecker makes a very loud rolling sound by\r\ndrumming on dry limbs and when concerned about the nest a shrill\r\n_kick-er-uck-a-kick_. The ordinary call is _tschick_ or _tschuck_.” A\r\nnote of greeting, possibly part of a love-making performance, is thus\r\ndescribed by Mr. Achilles (1906): “Several times when the female was\r\ngetting grubs in the dead spruce near the hole, the male would fly from\r\nsome distant tree and alight near her. She would see him coming and,\r\njust about as he was about to alight, would spread her wings and utter\r\na ‘whe-e-e-e-ee.’ This call, which was its loudest at its middle point,\r\nrose and then fell to the same pitch at which it was begun.”\r\n\r\nRev. C. W. G. Eifrig (1906) heard a queer sound that “was as if\r\nproduced by pulling out the end of a clock spring and suddenly\r\nreleasing it, producing a wiry, humming sound. The author of it proved\r\nto be a male of this woodpecker. In the course of the half hour that I\r\nwatched him he showed himself master of quite a repertoire of notes and\r\nwould-be songs. When flying he would say: _chut chut_ and then rattle\r\nlike a Kingfisher. When hammering on a tree and preening himself, he\r\nwould intersperse those actions by chuckling: _duck, duck, duck_.”\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--All the three-toed woodpeckers can be easily recognized\r\nby the yellow patch on the crown of the adult male and by more or less\r\nyellow in the crowns or young birds of both sexes. The crown patch\r\nof the adult male _arcticus_ is larger and extends farther forward\r\nthan that of _tridactylus_. But the best field mark for the Arctic\r\nthree-toed woodpecker is the solid-black back, without any white\r\nmarkings, and in the female the solid-black crown as well; the dorsal\r\naspect, when the bird is clinging to a tree trunk, often appears wholly\r\nblack. The white stripe on the side of the head, below the eye, is much\r\nwider in _arcticus_ than in _tridactylus_, and the latter has the back\r\ntransversely banded with white.\r\n\r\n_Enemies._--Mr. Achilles (1906) relates the following:\r\n\r\n     In the course of the morning, two red-breasted nuthatches\r\n     tormented the woodpeckers for fifteen minutes. * * * They\r\n     hovered around the hole with drooping wings, holding their\r\n     tails up like wrens. One of them finally ventured into the\r\n     hole so far that just his tail was protruding. They would\r\n     fly away when the parents approached the hole, but would\r\n     return as soon as the nest was unprotected. After some time\r\n     the male woodpecker went into the hole, evidently intending\r\n     to peck them in case they should look into it. During the\r\n     three minutes he remained in the hole, he managed to keep\r\n     from looking out for one straight minute. Nevertheless,\r\n     he was greatly agitated, and would look out every few\r\n     seconds to see if the nuthatches were approaching,--his\r\n     crown-patch showing brightly. At last the male nuthatch\r\n     came to the edge of the hole, whereat the woodpecker made\r\n     an unsuccessful attempt to peck his opponent, afterward\r\n     flying out with a rush, and chasing the nuthatch for some\r\n     distance on the wing.\r\n\r\nSoon after that four Canada jays approached, and one of them ventured\r\nnear the nest hole, but the woodpecker and a hermit thrush succeeded in\r\ndriving him and his companions away, and they did not return.\r\n\r\nJoseph Dixon (1927) tells of an attempt by a black bear to rob a nest\r\nof young Arctic three-toed woodpeckers:\r\n\r\n     This nest was located only four feet above the ground in a\r\n     large live lodgepole pine. My attention was first attracted\r\n     to the locality by the unusually vigorous scolding of the\r\n     parent woodpeckers. A closer approach revealed the cause of\r\n     the excitement.\r\n\r\n     A bear had located the nest, probably through the noise of\r\n     the young woodpeckers, which were old enough to come to\r\n     the nest entrance to receive food, and which squealed with\r\n     anticipation of a meal any time any bird, animal or person\r\n     came close to the nest tree. In an endeavor to get at the\r\n     young in the nest, the bear had bitten out slabs of green\r\n     wood twelve inches long, two inches wide, and one-quarter\r\n     of an inch thick. The muddy stains around the inside of\r\n     the nest entrance showed that the bear had thrust his nose\r\n     into the hole repeatedly. But after gnawing over an area\r\n     10 by 10 inches on the tree trunk to a depth of more than\r\n     an inch, the bear gave it up as a bad job. Had the nest\r\n     been in an old stump, the outcome would probably have been\r\n     different. This offers a reasonable explanation of the\r\n     tendency of certain woodpeckers to nest in living trees.\r\n\r\nMr. Kennard tells in his notes of a female hummingbird that attacked\r\none of these woodpeckers: “Several times she swooped down at the\r\nwoodpecker, who, quick as a flash, would dodge around the trunk and out\r\nof her way.”\r\n\r\n_Winter._--The Arctic three-toed woodpecker is normally mainly resident\r\nin winter throughout most of its breeding range; it is a hardy bird\r\nand its food supply is available at all seasons, the grubs on which it\r\nfeeds remaining in the wood for more than one season. Probably a few\r\nwander southward nearly every winter, and there have been several heavy\r\nflights of these birds into the Northeastern States, which it is not\r\neasy to explain. Dr. Josselyn Van Tyne (1926) has given a full account\r\nof one of these invasions, to which the reader is referred. Mr. Forbush\r\n(1927) writes:\r\n\r\n     It is difficult to determine exactly what causes these\r\n     unusual migrations, They are not forced by inclement\r\n     weather, for one at least has occurred in a mild winter.\r\n     * * * It seems probable that the unusual invasions of the\r\n     species into New England follow summers when its food has\r\n     been unusually abundant. An excessive food supply tends to\r\n     fecundity, and overbreeding naturally compels expansion\r\n     and induces migration, whether among the lower animals or\r\n     humankind. Since the above was written, Mr. Josselyn Van\r\n     Tyne has published a paper regarding the unusual flight\r\n     of this species in 1923 in which he advances a similar\r\n     explanation. He says that between 1909 and 1914 there was\r\n     an irruption of the spruce budworm in eastern Canada and\r\n     Maine which resulted in the death of many trees and a\r\n     consequent increase of bark-beetles and borers, followed\r\n     by an increase in the number of these woodpeckers. On the\r\n     other hand a scarcity of the usual food supply may cause\r\n     migration. A wet season with few fires in the woods or a\r\n     scarcity of insects (such as the spruce bud-moth) that kill\r\n     trees might, later, cause a migration.\r\n\r\nIllustrating the length of the sojourn of these woodpeckers during the\r\nwinter of 1923-24, Dr. Van Tyne (1926) says:\r\n\r\n     The greatest concentration of these woodpeckers recorded at\r\n     any one point was on the estate of Mr. F. H. Kennard where\r\n     scores of dead and dying white pine afforded an abundance\r\n     of their special food. The first one seen was a male\r\n     collected on October 17. Another individual appeared by\r\n     October 20 and during the winter at least three males and\r\n     two females were accounted for, while all indications point\r\n     toward the actual presence of perhaps twice as many. The\r\n     most remarkable fact about this group of birds, however,\r\n     was the length of their stay, for both males and females\r\n     were seen as late as the middle of May and at least one\r\n     male stayed through the early part of June and was last\r\n     seen on June 12.\r\n\r\nOther invasions are recorded by Mr. Forbush (1927) as follows: “A\r\ngreat irruption of these birds occurred in the autumn of 1860. During\r\nthe following winter Mr. George O. Welch often saw as many as six or\r\neight at once in a piece of fire-killed timber in Lynn. * * * In the\r\nautumn of 1925, there was a lesser movement, and many returned through\r\nNew England in the spring of 1926. In the autumn of 1926 another\r\nconsiderable southward migration occurred.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North America south to the Central United States;\r\nnonmigratory.\r\n\r\nThe range of the Arctic three-toed woodpecker extends =north= to\r\ncentral Alaska (probably Tocatna Forks and Fairbanks); southern\r\nMackenzie (Fort Wrigley, Fort Providence, and Smith Portage); northern\r\nManitoba (Cochrane River and probably York Factory); Quebec (Richmond\r\nGulf, Godbout, and Madeline River); and Newfoundland (Nicholsville).\r\n=East= to Newfoundland (Nicholsville); probably rarely Prince Edward\r\nIsland (Baddeck); eastern New Brunswick (Tabusintac); probably\r\nrarely Nova Scotia (Advocate); Maine (Machias); and probably rarely\r\nMassachusetts (Winchendon and Concord). =South= to probably rarely\r\nMassachusetts (Concord); central Vermont (Pico Peak); southern Ontario\r\n(Ottawa, Algonquin Park, and Sand Lake); northern Michigan (Au Sable\r\nValley, Blaney, and Huron Mountain); probably northern Wisconsin\r\n(Kelley Brook and Star Lake); northern Minnesota (North Pacific\r\nJunction, Itasca Park, and White Earth); probably southwestern South\r\nDakota (Elk Mountains); northwestern Wyoming (Yellowstone Park);\r\nnorthwestern Montana (Glacier National Park and Fortine); northern\r\nIdaho (Fort Sherman); and central California (Mona Lake and Bear\r\nValley). =West= to California. (Bear Valley, Lassen Peak, and Mount\r\nShasta); Oregon (Pinehurst and Fort Klamath); Washington (Bumping Lake\r\nand probably Tiger); British Columbia (Arrow Lakes, Fort St. James,\r\nKispiox Valley, and Atlin); south-central Yukon (Six-mile River); and\r\nAlaska (Chitina Moraine and probably Tocatna Forks).\r\n\r\nDuring the winter season this species has been recorded =north= to\r\nAlaska (Copper River); Mackenzie (Fort Simpson, Fort Rae, and Fort\r\nReliance); Manitoba (Grand Rapids); Ontario (Arnprior and Ottawa); New\r\nBrunswick (Scotch Lake); and Nova Scotia (Pictou). While no regular\r\nmovements have been detected, individuals have been recorded at this\r\nseason =south= to Long Island, N. Y. (East Hampton and Southampton);\r\nnorthern New Jersey (Upper Montclair and Englewood); southern New York\r\n(Ithaca); Ohio (Painesville and Akron); Illinois (Rantoul and Peoria);\r\nIowa (Big Cedar River); and Nebraska (Omaha and Dakota).\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--Labrador: 3 records, May 27 to June 2.\r\n  Maine: 3 records, May 19 to June 12.\r\n  New Brunswick: 12 records, May 19 to June 30; 6 records, May 30 to\r\n    June 15, indicating the height of the season.\r\n  New York: 5 records, May 18 to June 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  PICOÏDES TRIDACTYLUS BACATUS Bangs\r\n\r\n                    AMERICAN THREE-TOED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                               PLATE 17\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThis North American race of the three-toed woodpecker occupies an\r\nextensive range in the Hudsonian and Canadian Zones of approximately\r\nthe eastern half of Canada, which extends into some of the Northern\r\nStates from Minnesota eastward. Two other races occupy similar zones\r\nin western Canada, Alaska, and the Rocky Mountains. The species is not\r\nparticularly common anywhere, but the eastern race seems to be the best\r\nknown. For a full discussion of the various races of the North American\r\nthree-toed woodpeckers, the reader is referred to an extensive paper\r\non the subject by Outram Bangs (1900). This woodpecker is not evenly\r\ndistributed throughout its range but seems to be confined to certain\r\nrather limited and favorable localities. William Brewster (1898) found\r\nit breeding in the eastern part of Coos County, N. H., on the eastern\r\nside of a small pond; “where an elevated ridge approaches the pond the\r\nbanks are above the reach of the highest floods and the land in the\r\nrear slopes gently upward. At this point a dense, vigorous forest of\r\nspruces, balsams and arbor vitaes, intermingled with a few deciduous\r\ntrees, comes quite to the water’s edge and here, on June 2d, 1897, I\r\nfound my first nest of the Banded Three-toed Woodpecker.”\r\n\r\nIn the same county, Charles L. Whittle (1920) found what he called a\r\ncolony of three-toed woodpeckers in “a single small area of virgin\r\nforest containing abundant white spruces and balsams, the former\r\nsplendid, healthy trees of large size, and the latter also large but\r\nhaving many trees diseased or decayed at the heart. * * * In the\r\narea of diseased balsams, a pleasant surprise awaited me, for here\r\nThree-toed Woodpeckers of both species, sexes, and all recognizable\r\nages, were distinctly common--a colony, so to speak, temporarily\r\nconcentrated owing to two factors: (1) The nearly complete destruction\r\nin this region of the former virgin forest of large conifers on which\r\nand in which they fed and nested; and (2) the presence of abundant food\r\nat this locality in the diseased balsam trees.”\r\n\r\nElon H. Eaton (1914) says:\r\n\r\n     In New York it is evidently confined to the Adirondack\r\n     forests. I have heard of no specimen taken farther from the\r\n     spruce belt than Waterville, Oneida county. It therefore\r\n     shares with the Spruce grouse, the Canada jay and the\r\n     Hudsonian chickadee the distinction of being one of our\r\n     perfectly nonmigratory species. Within the spruce and\r\n     balsam forests it is quite uniformly distributed, but is\r\n     less common than the Black-backed woodpecker, evidently\r\n     about one-half as common as that species. It inhabits both\r\n     the spruce swamps and the mountain sides. While making\r\n     the bird survey of the Mount Marcy district we found this\r\n     species breeding on the slopes of Marcy just above Skylight\r\n     camp, an altitude of 4,000 feet, and in the swamp at the\r\n     Upper Ausable lake at an altitude of 2,000 feet.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Mr. Brewster (1898) describes, in considerable detail, the\r\nnest he found in a spruce tree in Coos County, N. H., as follows:\r\n\r\n     On measuring the spruce I found it to be thirty-nine inches\r\n     in circumference one foot above the ground, and twenty-nine\r\n     inches at the nest. The hole was on the west side at a\r\n     height above the ground of exactly ten feet and eleven\r\n     inches. The entrance hole was somewhat irregular outwardly\r\n     measuring about one and three quarters inches in breadth by\r\n     two inches in height--the greater diameter vertically being\r\n     due to the fact that the lower edges had been chiselled\r\n     away rather freely to afford a foothold for the bird; half\r\n     an inch in, the hole was perfectly round, and measured one\r\n     and one-half inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n     The interior or nest cavity was irregularly gourd-shaped\r\n     and ten and one-eighth inches in depth, its greatest\r\n     diameter, about four and one-half inches, being midway\r\n     between the bottom and top. The walls were rough and seamy\r\n     but this was not, perhaps, the fault of the birds, for the\r\n     wood, although soft and easily worked, had evidently peeled\r\n     off in long, stringy fibers.\r\n\r\n     The eggs lay on a deep mat of these shreds some of which\r\n     were more than one inch in length.\r\n\r\nDr. C. Hart Merriam informed Major Bendire (1895) that “numerous nests\r\nwere found in the Adirondacks in June, 1883. Most of them were in the\r\nflooded timber bordering the inlet of Seventh Lake, Fulton Chain.\r\nThey varied from 5 to 12 feet in height above the water, and were in\r\nspruce, tamarack, pine, balsam, and cedar trees.” The nests of this\r\nwoodpecker are not always so low down as those mentioned above; Col.\r\nJohn E. Thayer took a set, near Upton, Maine, on June 9, 1898, that was\r\n20 feet from the ground in an old dead spruce stub; and the nests that\r\nMr. Eaton (1914) found in the Adirondacks “were situated in tamaracks\r\nand spruces from 25 to 40 feet from the ground.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Four seems to be the usual number of eggs laid by this\r\nwoodpecker; I can find no record of either more or fewer in complete\r\nsets. The eggs are ovate, pure white, and only moderately glossy. The\r\nmeasurements of 43 eggs average 23.32 by 18.01 millimeters; the eggs\r\nshowing the four extremes measure =25.5= by 18.2, 23.8 by =19.6=, and\r\n=20.1= by =15.0= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation is said to be about 14 days, and it\r\nis shared by both sexes. Both parents feed and care for the young, even\r\nafter the young leave the nest, as family parties are seen traveling\r\nabout together in summer.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The nestlings are probably hatched naked and blind, as\r\nwith other woodpeckers, but the juvenal plumage is acquired before the\r\nyoung leave the nest. In the juvenal plumage, the young male is similar\r\nto the adult male, but the yellow crown patch is smaller and less\r\nsharply defined; the upper parts are duller, brownish black instead of\r\nsooty black; the flanks are more heavily and more extensively banded,\r\nor spotted, with sepia instead of clear black; the white of the throat\r\nand breast is tinged with pale buffy. The juvenal female is similar\r\nto the young male, but the yellow crown patch is smaller, and the\r\namount of yellow in it is very variable, sometimes only a few scattered\r\nfeathers and sometimes a well-defined, clear patch. This plumage is\r\nworn at least through August and probably well into fall. The only\r\nmolting adults I have seen were taken in August.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The feeding habits of the American three-toed woodpecker are\r\nalmost identical with that of the Arctic three-toed. Prof. F. E. L.\r\nBeal (1911) says:\r\n\r\n     The largest item with both species is wood-boring\r\n     coleopterous larvae. These amount to 64.25 percent with\r\n     _arcticus_ and 60.66 with _americanus_. Caterpillars, which\r\n     in this case are mostly wood-boring species, amount to\r\n     12.88 and 14.45 percent for the two birds respectively. The\r\n     total of wood-boring larvae, including both caterpillars\r\n     and beetles, is, 77.13 percent for _arcticus_ and 75.11\r\n     percent for _americanus_, or more than three-fourths of the\r\n     food of both species. * * *\r\n\r\n     Fruit skins were found in only one stomach of _americanus_\r\n     and mast in but one stomach of _arcticus_. Cambium was\r\n     found in 10 stomachs of _arcticus_ and 8 of _americanus_.\r\n     This indicates that these birds do some pecking at the bark\r\n     of living trees for other purposes than getting insects,\r\n     but no complaints have yet been made, from which we infer\r\n     that little or no damage is done; in fact the amount\r\n     contained in the stomachs is not large a little less than\r\n     10 percent.\r\n\r\nE. H. Forbush (1927) says that “Miss Caroline E. Hamilton of\r\nGreenfield, Massachusetts, observed in late September an individual\r\nthat remained in a yard from daylight till dark, making the rounds of\r\nthe trees and remaining longest on the fruit trees at the tiny holes\r\nattributed to Sapsuckers. She said that the bird seemed to find good\r\nfood in these pits, and it may have been eating some of the cambium.”\r\nHe writes further:\r\n\r\n     Mr. E. O. Grant, a faithful correspondent of Patten, Maine,\r\n     travels over considerable region and north into Quebec,\r\n     spending much time in the woods. On March 6, 1922, he wrote\r\n     that the spruce budworm had killed about thirty percent\r\n     of the spruce in that region and nearly all the fir, and\r\n     that among the dead trees he saw hundreds of both the\r\n     three-toed species, together with nearly equal numbers\r\n     of Downy Woodpeckers and Hairy Woodpeckers. Food for the\r\n     birds was very plentiful, as dark-beetles and spruce-borers\r\n     were numerous. When an invasion of caterpillars strips\r\n     coniferous trees and thus exposes their trunks and\r\n     branches to the hot summer sun, dark-beetles attack and\r\n     virtually girdle them with numerous tunnels beneath the\r\n     bark; borers get in and sometimes most of the trees die.\r\n     The woodpeckers, concentrating on these dead trees from\r\n     all the forest around about, help to keep down the undue\r\n     increase of bark-beetles and borers which, if they became\r\n     too numerous, might attack some live trees.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Lucien M. Turner says in his unpublished notes: “The\r\nmanner of flight of this species is less vigorous than in _Picoides\r\narcticus_, yet differing in a manner that is difficult to describe;\r\nthe unfolding of the wings when preparing to make the upward swoop is\r\nquicker, the stroke of the wing not so strong, and the plunge not so\r\ndeep.”\r\n\r\nBoth species of three-toed woodpeckers are fearless birds, tame, and\r\nunsuspicious, probably because of their unfamiliarity with man and his\r\nhostile intentions; both are less active than most other woodpeckers,\r\nthis species being particularly quiet in its movements and sedentary in\r\nits habits. Mr. Brewster (1898) writes:\r\n\r\n     My previous impression that _Picoides americanus_ is a very\r\n     much less active and restless bird than _P. arcticus_,\r\n     was fully confirmed by the behavior of this male who was\r\n     almost if not quite as slow and lethargic of movement as\r\n     a sapsucker. He would spend minutes at a time clinging to\r\n     one spot and when he moved up the tree trunks it was in a\r\n     singularly slow, deliberate manner. Only when at or near\r\n     the nest did he show real animation. * * *\r\n\r\n     I have rarely seen a nesting bird so alert and keen of\r\n     hearing as was this _Picoides_. The sound of our voices or\r\n     the slightest noise made by an oar or paddle would bring\r\n     him at once to the entrance of the hole, even when we were\r\n     forty or fifty yards away, and every few minutes when we\r\n     were sitting perfectly still he would look out turning\r\n     his head in every direction. He would not leave the hole,\r\n     however, until we were within a few yards of the foot of\r\n     the tree and after he had drummed awhile he would return\r\n     to the stub while we were sitting near its base with the\r\n     camera directed towards it. * * *\r\n\r\n     On returning to the stub the bird would usually strike\r\n     against it about two feet below the hole and reaching it\r\n     by two or three quick, upward hops would cling to its\r\n     lower edge, alternately looking in and down at us. * * *\r\n     He did not once enter the nest while we were near the\r\n     tree, nor did he again attempt to mislead us by pecking at\r\n     the bark, evidently realizing that this ruse had failed.\r\n     When he flew back into the woods he always took one of two\r\n     courses and along each he invariably alighted not only on\r\n     the same trees but on the same spot on each tree. He had\r\n     one particular place on the trunk of a large spruce where\r\n     he would spend ten or fifteen minutes at a time pluming\r\n     himself and watching us, before returning to the nest.\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) quotes the following from Dr. C. Hart Merriam:\r\n\r\n     We had just crossed the boundary line between Lewis and\r\n     Herkimer counties, when Mr. Bagg called my attention to a\r\n     “fresh hole,” about 8 feet from the ground, in a spruce\r\n     tree near by. On approaching the tree a yellow crown\r\n     appeared in the hole, showing that the male bird was “at\r\n     home.” To prevent his escape I jumped toward the tree and\r\n     introduced three fingers, which were immediately punctured\r\n     in a manner so distasteful to their proprietor as to\r\n     necessitate an immediate withdrawal and exchange for the\r\n     muzzle of my friend’s gun. A handkerchief was next crowded\r\n     into the hole, but was instantly riddled and driven out\r\n     by a few blows from his terrible bill. It was then held\r\n     loosely over the hole, and as the bird emerged I secured\r\n     and killed him.\r\n\r\nWendell Taber had a good chance to observe one of these woodpeckers\r\nat short range in Grafton County, N. H., on May 31, 1937, about which\r\nhe writes to me: “The bird was intent upon obtaining its food and\r\nignored our presence. Most of the time the bird would fly to a tree\r\nand alight at a height of 20 to 25 feet, then work downward, hopping\r\nbackward. Particularly it seemed to enjoy prodding around on the base\r\nof a tree at or within an inch or two of where tree and earth met.\r\nDrilling was barely audible, even when the bird was close-to. Both live\r\nand dead trees were attacked impartially. There was no strip act--the\r\nbark was not peeled off. There was a row of dead trees at the edge of\r\nthe forest, which might well have been concentrated on, but which,\r\nactually, was attacked only in a haphazard manner along with trees\r\nalive in the forest. If anything, more attention was given to live\r\ntrees.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The three-toed woodpecker is normally a rather silent\r\nbird. Its weak notes have been likened to the squealing notes of the\r\nyellow-bellied sapsucker, or the squeak of a small mammal; it also\r\nutters a variety of short notes like _queep_ or _quip_. Horace W.\r\nWright (1911) says: “The calls of the _americanus_ male bird were not\r\nexcited or loud. The single calls were somewhat like the robin’s call\r\nat dusk, and the rattling calls resembled a Hairy Woodpecker’s rattle,\r\nbut were less loud and sharp.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brewster (1898) writes:\r\n\r\n     I had abundant opportunities for studying the drumming call\r\n     today. It varied in duration from one to two seconds (never\r\n     running over or under these limits) but was usually one and\r\n     a half to one and three quarters seconds. The intervals\r\n     between the calls were too irregular to be worth recording.\r\n     The first three or four taps were slightly slower and\r\n     more disconnected than the remaining ones but the general\r\n     effect was that of a uniform roll similar to that made\r\n     by the Downy and the Hairy Woodpecker, but less loud and\r\n     penetrating. Still it carried well and under favorable\r\n     conditions could be heard fully one quarter of a mile away.\r\n     * * *\r\n\r\n     After drumming a dozen times or more he gave a long vocal\r\n     call closely similar to the Kingfisher-like rattle of the\r\n     Hairy Woodpecker.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The American three-toed woodpecker is the only\r\nwoodpecker likely to be seen in the northern woods that has a black\r\nback transversely barred with white, white under parts banded with\r\nblack on the flanks, and a black crown, with or without a yellow crown\r\npatch; the yellow patch is very prominent in the adult male and less so\r\nin the young birds of both sexes, but lacking in the adult female. In\r\nflight the “ladderback” is more conspicuous than when the bird is at\r\nrest, and the tail flashes white.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Both species of three-toed woodpeckers are mainly resident\r\nthroughout the year within their breeding ranges, as their normal food\r\nsupply is as easily available in winter as in summer. Consequently few\r\nspecies of birds are less inclined to migrate than these woodpeckers.\r\nHowever, on rare occasions this woodpecker has been known to appear in\r\nwinter somewhat south of its summer range. Probably these southward\r\nmovements have been due to some shortage of food in its summer home,\r\nor an unusual supply of it further south, or, possibly, an unusually\r\nsuccessful breeding season may have overcrowded the home range and\r\ncaused an exodus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Northern Europe, Asia, and North America, south through high\r\nmountainous regions to about latitude 35° N.; nonmigratory.\r\n\r\nIn North America the range of the three-toed woodpecker extends\r\n=north= to northern Alaska (Kowak River, Tanana, Beaver Creek, Fort\r\nYukon, Circle, and Charlie Creek); northern Yukon (Forty Mile and\r\nprobably Coal Creek); Mackenzie (Fort McPherson, Fort Goodhope,\r\nFort Anderson, Fort Rae, and Fort Smith); northern Manitoba (Fort\r\nDu Brochet and Churchill); northern Ontario (Fort Albany); northern\r\nQuebec (Fort Chimo); and Labrador (Okak). =East= to Labrador (Okak\r\nand Nain); Newfoundland (South Exploit River); northeastern Maine\r\n(Presque Isle); and New Hampshire (Lake Umbagog and Mount Jefferson).\r\n=South= to northern New Hampshire (Mount Jefferson); northern New\r\nYork (Long Lake and Moose River); probably northern Michigan (Isle\r\nRoyal); northern Minnesota (Lake Itasca); northern New Mexico (Pecos\r\nBaldy and Chuska Mountains); Arizona (White Mountains, San Francisco\r\nMountain, and Kaibab Plateau); east-central Nevada (Snake Mountains);\r\nand southwestern Oregon (Four-mile Lake). =West= to western Oregon\r\n(Four-mile Lake); Washington (Blue Mountains, probably Mount Rainier,\r\nand Mount Baker); British Columbia (Chilliwack, Clinton, Willow River,\r\nand Hazelton); and Alaska (Chichagof Island, Glacier, Copper River, Lake\r\nClark, Mount McKinley, Nulato, and Kowak River).\r\n\r\nSeveral races of this species have been recognized, three of which\r\nare included in the range above outlined. The American three-toed\r\nwoodpecker (_P. t. bacatus_) ranges from Maine, Newfoundland, and\r\nLabrador west to northern Manitoba and southern Mackenzie; the Alpine\r\nthree-toed woodpecker (_P. t. dorsalis_) is the Rocky Mountain form\r\nand is found in that region from Montana and Idaho south to the higher\r\nmountains of New Mexico and Arizona; the Alaska three-toed woodpecker\r\n(_P. t. fasciatus_) is found from Alaska, Yukon, and western Mackenzie\r\nsouth to Oregon, Idaho, and Montana.\r\n\r\nWhile the three-toed woodpecker is not regularly migratory, it\r\nappears likely that during severe winters it withdraws somewhat from\r\nthe northern parts of its range. At this season it is occasionally\r\ncollected or observed short distances south of its normal range\r\n(Massachusetts, southern Wisconsin, southern Minnesota, and southern\r\nNew Mexico).\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--Alberta: 8 records, May 23 to June 16.\r\n  Arctic America: 5 records, May 15 to June 9.\r\n  Labrador: 3 records, May 26 and 27.\r\n  New York: 3 records, May 14 to June 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 PICOÏDES TRIDACTYLUS FASCIATUS Baird\r\n\r\n                     ALASKA THREE-TOED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe range of this race of the three-toed woodpecker extends throughout\r\nthe Hudsonian and Canadian Zones of western Canada and Alaska, and a\r\nshort distance southward into some of the Western States, where it\r\nintergrades with the next form in the boreal forests of the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nRidgway (1914) describes it as similar to the eastern race, “but\r\nwith much more white on back, the white bars much larger and more or\r\nless coalesced along median line, forming a more or less continuous\r\nlongitudinal patch; whitish spots on forehead much larger, sometimes\r\ncoalesced into a nearly uniform dull white frontal area; upper\r\ntail-coverts and lower rump barred or spotted with white; sometimes\r\neven the wing-coverts and middle rectrices are spotted with white;\r\nblack malar stripe narrower and usually less distinct, and black bars\r\non sides and flanks narrower; averaging slightly larger.”\r\n\r\nDr. E. W. Nelson (1887) says that this woodpecker occurs “on the\r\nheadwaters of the Mackenzie River, extending thence north along the\r\ncourse of this stream and the Anderson River, and westward, covering\r\nall the wooded portions of Northern Alaska to the northern tree-limit,\r\n* * * outnumbering by far the combined numbers of all the other\r\nwoodpeckers of that region. * * * On the Yukon these birds are said to\r\nprefer the groves of poplar and willow to the spruces.”\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph Grinnell (1900) says: “This, the only species of woodpecker\r\ndetected by me in the Kowak region, was resident throughout the year.\r\nIt could scarcely be called common, though its borings were noticed in\r\nnearly every tract of spruces visited.” J. A. Munro (1919), referring\r\nto the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia, says: “This species is\r\nresident and fairly common in Murray pine, Western larch, and spruce\r\nforests. I have never found them in yellow pine or Douglas fir country.\r\nThey prefer the burnt areas of timber, and specimens collected are\r\ngenerally stained with charcoal on the underparts.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The nesting habits of this woodpecker do not differ\r\nmaterially from those of its eastern relative. Bendire (1895) mentions\r\ntwo sets of eggs, collected by MacFarlane in the Anderson River region,\r\nof which he says: “A single egg, originally from a set of three taken\r\non May 30, 1863, accompanied by the female bird, was taken from a\r\ncavity in a pine tree, 4 feet from the ground, and another set of four,\r\nof which there are three eggs remaining, and likewise accompanied by\r\nthe male bird, was taken on June 5, 1864, from a hole in a dry spruce,\r\nsituated about 6 feet from the ground. The eggs from the last set were\r\nsaid to have been lying on the decayed dust of the tree, and were\r\nperfectly fresh when found.”\r\n\r\nLaing and Taverner (1929) found an abandoned nest in the Chitina River\r\nregion, Alaska, of which they say: “Tree, about 15 inches in diameter\r\nat butt, had a dead top and nest in this dead portion, about 40 feet\r\naloft. Dimensions as follows: diameter of door barely 2 inches; depth\r\nof nest 9½ inches; greatest diameter 3 inches. Barrel of nest quite\r\ncylindrical.”\r\n\r\nThere is a set of four eggs in my collection, taken by Richard C.\r\nHarlow near Belvedere, Alberta, on May 29, 1926. The nest was about 20\r\nfeet above ground in a dead tamarack stub, among a scattered growth of\r\ntamaracks, in a muskeg, near a lake; the eggs lay on a bed of chips 10\r\ninches below the entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. Munro (1919) writes: “On May 28, 1917, I found a nest that had just\r\nbeen finished, thirty feet from the ground in a dead Murray pine. The\r\nentrance was smaller than would be expected, slightly over one and a\r\nhalf inches, and the hole about fourteen inches deep.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The eggs of the Alaska three-toed woodpecker are\r\nindistinguishable from those of the eastern race. The measurements of\r\n12 eggs average 22.08 by 17.09 millimeters; the eggs showing the four\r\nextremes measure =23.6= by =18.1=, =20.8= by 16.8, and 21.5 by =16.5=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The plumages, feeding habits, and general behavior of this\r\nrace do not differ materially from those of the species elsewhere,\r\nbut Maj. Allan Brooks (Dawson and Bowles, 1909) has given a good\r\ndescription of a habit that seems to be shared by both species of\r\n_Picoïdes_ and that has been referred to by others; he writes:\r\n\r\n     When shot, even if instantly killed, three-toed woodpeckers\r\n     of both species have a marvelous faculty of remaining\r\n     clinging to the tree in death. Where the trunks are draped\r\n     with _Usnea_ moss, it is impossible to bring one down,\r\n     except when winged--then they attempt to fly, and fall\r\n     to earth; but when killed outright they remain securely\r\n     fastened by their strong curved claws. * * * The only\r\n     chance is to leave the bird and to visit the foot of the\r\n     tree when the relaxing muscles have at length permitted the\r\n     body to drop--usually within two days. Once I was fortunate\r\n     enough to observe the exact position that enabled the bird\r\n     to maintain its grip. I had shot and killed an Arctic\r\n     Three-toed Woodpecker on a low stump. On going up I found\r\n     the bird’s feet to be three inches apart by measurement;\r\n     the tail was firmly braced, and the further the body was\r\n     tilted back the more firmly the claws held in the bark.\r\n\r\nDr. Grinnell (1900) says: “In the fall and mid-winter these birds are\r\nsilent and seldom seen. But after the first of March their drumming\r\non some resonant dead tree was heard nearly every morning. This sound\r\ncould be heard a long distance through the quiet woods, giving notice\r\nof the whereabouts of the woodpeckers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  PICOÏDES TRIDACTYLUS DORSALIS Baird\r\n\r\n                     ALPINE THREE-TOED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThis race of the three-toed woodpeckers enjoys the most southern\r\ndistribution of any of the birds of this genus, ranging from northern\r\nMontana to northern Arizona and New Mexico, in the boreal forests of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. Ridgway (1914) characterizes it as “similar to\r\nwhite-backed examples of _P. a. fasciatus_, but larger; white markings\r\non back usually all longitudinal (very rarely with any transverse bars\r\nof black), white supra-auricular streak usually broader, forehead\r\nusually with more black and less whitish spotting, white spots or bars\r\non inner web of innermost secondaries larger, and sides and flanks\r\nusually less barred with black.”\r\n\r\nThe Weydemeyers (1928) say that in northwestern Montana, “unlike\r\n_arcticus_, this species prefers dense, virgin forests to cut-over\r\nwoods and open woodland pastures. * * * In the higher elevations,\r\nthis woodpecker may be found in white pine, lodgepole pine, alpine\r\nfir, and Engelmann spruce forests. In the Transition zone, it shows\r\na preference for spruce woods, with larch and yellow pine forests as\r\nsecond choice. In the Canadian zone, this species is somewhat commoner\r\nthan _arcticus_; in the Transition zone, it occurs only about one-third\r\nas frequently as does the larger bird.”\r\n\r\nM. P. Skinner says, in his Yellowstone National Park notes: “This\r\nwoodpecker is rather uncommon, but I have seen it in coniferous forests\r\nbetween 6,500 and 8,000 feet, in firs, lodgepole pine, and Engelmann\r\nspruce. I have also seen it on dead trees and on telephone poles. I\r\nhave seen this woodpecker in this Park only between May and October.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--At an altitude of about 9,000 feet in the mountains of\r\nColorado, in or near Estes Park, John H. Flanagan (1911) collected a\r\nset of four eggs of the alpine three-toed woodpecker. “The hole was in\r\nan aspen stub, nine feet from the ground and about a foot or eighteen\r\ninches from the top, and just before the guide reached the hole the\r\nbird flew out. * * *\r\n\r\n“The entrance to the nesting cavity was about one and one-half inches\r\nin diameter; the cavity itself about nine or ten inches in depth and\r\nquite large at the bottom. The eggs were laid on a few chips.”\r\n\r\nIn north-central Colorado, Edwin R. Warren (1912) found a nest of this\r\nwoodpecker “in a dead Engelmann spruce, which was twenty-five inches\r\nin diameter at the base, and twenty at the nest hole, the latter being\r\nseven feet above ground. The nest was eight inches deep, the entrance\r\none and three-quarters inches in diameter; the thickness of the wood on\r\nthe front side of the hole was two and three-quarters inches, and the\r\ncavity was five inches from front to back, and three wide. There were\r\na few chips in the bottom, as well as a few of the birds’ droppings.\r\nThere were two young, about ready to fly, though I had no difficulty in\r\nposing them on the tree for pictures; they showed little or no fear.”\r\n\r\nRandolph Jenks (1934) discovered two nests of the alpine three-toed\r\nwoodpecker on the Kaibab Plateau, near the east rim of the Grand\r\nCanyon, in northern Arizona. One was in “a hole in an aspen tree, two\r\nand one-half inches in diameter, opening to the southeast, twelve feet\r\nfrom the ground. The cavity was eight inches deep and the nest was\r\nlined with a thick layer of maggot-infested sawdust. In spite of the\r\ncrawling competitors, the nestlings, a male and a female, seemed quite\r\ncontented.” This was on June 30, 1931. Several days later another nest\r\nwas found, also on the Plateau, at an elevation of 8,100 feet; this\r\nnest was “in a hole about sixty feet above the ground in a western\r\nyellow pine.”\r\n\r\nDr. Edgar A. Mearns (1890b) writes:\r\n\r\n     The Alpine Three-toed Woodpecker breeds commonly throughout\r\n     the pine belt, seldom ascending far into the spruce woods\r\n     of the highest peaks [in the mountains of Arizona]. On the\r\n     northwestern slope of San Francisco Mountain I discovered a\r\n     nest of this species on June 8, 1887. The female was seen\r\n     alone pecking at a large yellow pine, which, although dead,\r\n     still retained its bark and was quite solid. While feeding\r\n     she uttered a peculiar, harsh, nasal cry. I shot her, and\r\n     then noticed a small, neatly bored hole in the south side\r\n     of the pine trunk, about 30 feet from the ground and away\r\n     from branches. With the aid of a rope, and taking a start\r\n     from the saddle, I was scarcely able to climb to the nest,\r\n     which the male did not quit until I was well up; then he\r\n     came out and uttered a sudden, sharp “whip-whip-whip” in\r\n     a menacing tone, remaining hard by while I worked with\r\n     saw and chisel. It took me nearly half an hour to make an\r\n     opening sufficiently large to admit the hand, as the burrow\r\n     was situated so extraordinarily deep. Two young, male and\r\n     female, with feathers just sprouting, were found on a bed\r\n     of small chips at the bottom of the burrow, not more than\r\n     8 inches lower than the entrance, but in the very heart of\r\n     the tree, the cavity being oblique and pear-shaped, and\r\n     having the strong odor characteristic of Woodpeckers’ nests\r\n     in general. Both parents and their progeny were preserved,\r\n     and are now in the American Museum collection. The irides\r\n     of the adults were dark cherry red; their feet, claws, and\r\n     basal half of mandible plumbeous, the rest of the bill\r\n     being plumbeous black.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The alpine three-toed woodpecker is said to lay five eggs to a\r\nset, but probably the set oftener consists of fewer eggs. I have seen\r\nno eggs of this subspecies; and the only measurements I have been able\r\nto get are those from a set of five eggs, collected by A. Treganza in\r\nSalt Lake County, Utah, on June 3, 1916; these are in the P. B. Philipp\r\ncollection in the American Museum of Natural History. The measurements\r\naverage 24.52 by 17.52 millimeters, rather large for the species; the\r\neggs showing the four extremes measure =25.3= by =17.7= and =24.1= by\r\n=17.4= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Mrs. Bailey (1928) says that the food of this woodpecker\r\nconsists of “over 75 percent, destructive wood-boring larvae of\r\ncaterpillars and beetles. The Three-toed Woodpeckers rank high as\r\nconservators of the forest, eliminating annually, as Professor Beal\r\nhas estimated, some 13,675 of the grubs most destructive to forests.\r\nThe scarcity of these useful woodpeckers makes their protection and\r\nencouragement especially important.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SPHYRAPICUS VARIUS VARIUS (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\n                       YELLOW-BELLIED SAPSUCKER\r\n\r\n                             PLATES 18, 19\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\n                  CONTRIBUTED BY WINSOR MARRETT TYLER\r\n\r\n_Spring._--It is spring in the Transition Zone when in April the\r\nyellow-bellied sapsucker passes through on the way from its winter\r\nquarters to its breeding ground in the Canadian Zone. If spring\r\nis tardy most of the trees may be leafless, but many of them have\r\nblossomed, and the sap is running.\r\n\r\nAt this season the sapsucker is light-hearted and jaunty compared to\r\nthe sober, quiet bird that visited us the autumn before. The breeding\r\nseason is near at hand, and if two birds meet they often engage in a\r\nsort of game, a precursory courtship, wherein one bird flies at the\r\nother in a playful attack; the other eludes the rush of the oncoming\r\nbird by a sudden, last-minute retreat--winding around the branch on\r\nwhich it rests, or sliding off into the air. In these pursuits in and\r\nout among the branches we are impressed by the agility and grace of\r\nthe birds and by the easy way they direct their course through the\r\nair. They do not appear to impel themselves by strength of wing alone,\r\nbut, especially in their slanting descents, they let the force of\r\ngravity pull them swiftly along, and then, by the impetus of the speed\r\nattained, glide upward to a perch. They seem to swing from branch to\r\nbranch with little effort, slowly opening and closing their wings to\r\nguide them on their way. As we watch them we are reminded of trapeze\r\nartists in the circus.\r\n\r\nBut the new sap is running, and the birds quickly tap the supply by\r\ndrilling into the bark of their favorite trees and drink of the sap as\r\nit flows freely from the wounds.\r\n\r\nEvery spring the birds come to a sturdy yellow birch tree on the Boston\r\nPublic Garden, a species of tree with which they must be familiar on\r\ntheir breeding grounds in the north. The sap flows plenteously in\r\nmid-April from the many punctures that the birds make; it wets a large\r\nportion of the trunk of the tree and often drips to the ground from the\r\nbranches. The birds stand clear of the tree as they feed at the sap\r\nwells with only the feet and the tip of the tail touching the bark.\r\nThe tail is braced against the trunk at an angle of about 45°, and the\r\nfeet reach far forward to grasp the bark opposite the bend of the wing.\r\nI have never seen a sapsucker crouch against this wet bark as a downy\r\nwoodpecker commonly does when digging out a grub--like a cat hunched up\r\nlapping a saucer of milk. When a bird wishes to move to a point below\r\nwhere it is perched, it jumps from the tree and floats in the air,\r\nthen turning, with its wings held out somewhat, dives head-downward,\r\ndrifting in an easy, leisurely manner as if moving under water; then,\r\njust before alighting, it rights itself. If you come too near, the\r\nsapsucker scrambles around to the rear of the limb, and if you step\r\nclose up to the tree, the bird starts away in free, sweeping curves,\r\nlike a skater over the ice, the white in the wing flashing out.\r\n\r\nEaton (1914) notes that “during the migration it is evident that the\r\nmale birds arrive first, for during 15 years of continuous records\r\nwhich I have kept with this object in view I have found that male birds\r\nare the first to be seen each year and no females are seen for several\r\ndays after the first males arrive.”\r\n\r\nAudubon (1842) records the following unique observation:\r\n\r\n     While travelling I observed that they performed their\r\n     migration by day, in loose parties or families of six or\r\n     seven individuals, flying at a great height, and at the\r\n     intervals between their sailings and the flappings of their\r\n     wings, emitting their remarkable plaintive cries. When\r\n     alighting towards sunset, they descended with amazing speed\r\n     in a tortuous manner, and first settled on the tops of the\r\n     highest trees, where they remained perfectly silent for\r\n     awhile, after which they betook themselves to the central\r\n     parts of the thickest trees, and searched along the trunks\r\n     for abandoned holes of Squirrels or Woodpeckers, in which\r\n     they spent the night, several together in the same hole.\r\n\r\nA. B. Klugh (1909) reports a remarkably large gathering of sapsuckers\r\non their northward migration. He says:\r\n\r\n     On the morning of April 17th, 1909, the city of Kingston,\r\n     Ontario, was alive with yellow-bellied sapsuckers.\r\n\r\n     From my study window I saw some twenty of them on the trees\r\n     at the lodge of the park and on going out to investigate\r\n     I found from one to four on nearly every tree. As a\r\n     conservative estimate I placed the number of birds in the\r\n     park at three hundred. * * *\r\n\r\n     The probable cause of this immense wave of yellow-bellied\r\n     sapsuckers striking Kingston lies in the strong gale from\r\n     the north which was blowing on the night of April 16th, the\r\n     birds apparently dropping as soon as they had crossed the\r\n     lake.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Little has been recorded on the courtship of the\r\nyellow-bellied sapsucker, but we may get a hint of its early stages at\r\nleast as the birds pass northward--the increased interest in each other\r\nshown by their lively pursuits and their rapid whirlings among the\r\nbranches, as noted under “Spring.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Miksch Sutton (1928b) speaks thus of the birds on their nesting\r\nground in Pennsylvania: “In late May and June the mewing cry was\r\nfamiliar and they occasionally indulged in strange courtship antics,\r\nflashing through the tops of the trees, calling excitedly in tones\r\nresembling those of a flicker, and dancing about with wings and tail\r\nspread in a manner utterly foreign to the usually stolid bearing of\r\nmigrant individuals.”\r\n\r\nOf the spring drumming, perhaps a part of courtship, Dr. Harry C.\r\nOberholser (1896b) says:\r\n\r\n     In spring the drumming of the yellow-bellied sapsucker\r\n     may usually be easily recognized by the following\r\n     peculiarities. Four or five taps given in quick succession\r\n     are followed by a short pause, this being soon succeeded\r\n     by two short quick taps; then another pause, and two more\r\n     taps in somewhat less rapid succession than the first;\r\n     followed by yet another pause, and two additional taps\r\n     still a little slower. This is sometimes slightly varied\r\n     with regard to the number of taps; and occasionally also\r\n     the latter part consists only of single quick taps with an\r\n     increasing interval toward the last.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the tapping of the sapsucker and of the hairy\r\nand the downy woodpecker is described in the life history of the latter\r\nbird. Wendell Taber told Mr. Bent that he succeeded in calling up three\r\nof these birds by imitating their drumming with a fountain pen on a\r\ndead tree; one of them alighted on the tree on which he was drumming.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--William Brewster (1876a), writing of the nesting of the\r\nsapsucker at Umbagog Lake, Maine, says:\r\n\r\n     They arrive from the South, where they spend the winter,\r\n     from the middle to the last of April, and, pairing being\r\n     soon effected, commence at once the excavation of their\r\n     nests. The trees usually selected are large dead birches,\r\n     and a decided preference is manifested for the vicinity\r\n     of water, though some nests occur on high ground in the\r\n     interior of the woods, but never so abundantly there as\r\n     along the margin of rivers and lakes. Both sexes work\r\n     alternately, relieving each other at frequent intervals,\r\n     the bird not employed usually clinging near the hole and\r\n     encouraging its toiling mate, by an occasional low cry.\r\n     With the deepening of the hole arises the necessity for\r\n     increased labor, as the rapidly accumulating debris must\r\n     be removed, and the bird now appears at frequent intervals\r\n     at the entrance, and, dropping its mouthful of chips,\r\n     returns to its work. A week or more is occupied in the\r\n     completion of the nest, the time varying considerably with\r\n     the relative hardness of the wood. A small quantity of the\r\n     finer chips are left at the bottom to serve as a bed for\r\n     the eggs. * * * The labor of incubation, like all other\r\n     duties, is shared equally by the two sexes. * * *\r\n\r\n     All nests examined upon this occasion [an occasion when\r\n     he found half a dozen nests] were of uniform gourd-like\r\n     shape, with the sides very smoothly and evenly chiselled.\r\n     They averaged about fourteen inches in depth by five in\r\n     diameter at the widest point, while the diameter of the\r\n     exterior hole varied from 1.25 to 1.60 inches. So small,\r\n     indeed, was this entrance in proportion to the size of the\r\n     bird, that in many cases they were obliged to struggle\r\n     violently for several seconds in either going out or in.\r\n     The nests in most instances were very easily discovered, as\r\n     the bird was almost always in the immediate vicinity, and\r\n     if the tree was approached would fly to the hole and utter\r\n     a few low calls, which would bring out its sitting mate,\r\n     when both would pass to and from the spot, emitting notes\r\n     of anxiety and alarm. The bird not employed in incubation\r\n     has also a peculiar habit of clinging to the trunk just\r\n     below the hole, in a perfectly motionless and strikingly\r\n     pensive attitude, apparently looking in, though from the\r\n     conformation of the interior it would be impossible for it\r\n     to see its mate or eggs. In this position it will remain\r\n     without moving for many minutes at a time.\r\n\r\nHenry Mousley (1916) states that the bird “often nests year after year\r\nin the same tree (but not necessarily in the same hole) the favourite\r\nones here [Hatley, Quebec] being elm, poplar, and butternut. * * *\r\nOf two nests examined the average dimensions are as follows, viz.:\r\nentrance hole 1⅜ inches in diameter, extreme depth 10¾ inches, and\r\nwidth 2⅞ inches.”\r\n\r\nPhilipp and Bowdish (1917) say of the nesting site in New Brunswick:\r\n“The favorite situation was the dead heart of a live poplar, most\r\noften on the bank of a stream, and facing same, but some nests were in\r\ntotally dead trees, of different kinds. They ranged from eight to forty\r\nfeet from ground.”\r\n\r\nBendire (1895) says that the birds “are devoted parents, and when\r\nincubation is somewhat advanced, or the young have been recently\r\nhatched, the bird on the nest is loath to leave it, and will sometimes\r\nallow itself to be captured rather than to desert its treasures.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--[AUTHOR’S NOTE: The yellow-bellied sapsucker lays four\r\nto seven eggs to a set, though five or six eggs are more commonly\r\nfound. They vary from ovate to elliptical-ovate and sometimes to\r\nelliptical-oval. The shell is smooth and either dull or moderately\r\nglossy. They are pure white, like all woodpeckers’ eggs. The\r\nmeasurements of 52 eggs average 22.44 by 16.92 millimeters; the eggs\r\nshowing the four extremes measure =24.9= by 17.0, 23.8 by =18.0=,\r\n=20.57= by 16.26, and 22.1 by =15.5= millimeters.]\r\n\r\n_Young._--As in the case of most nestling birds reared in a hole in a\r\ntree, little is known of the young sapsuckers while they are in the\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nFrank Bolles (1892) speaks of “a nest filled with noisy fledglings\r\nwhose squealing sounded afar in the otherwise silent woods. * * * The\r\nparent birds came frequently to the tree, and their arrival was always\r\ngreeted by more vigorous crying from the young.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Brewster (1876a), in his study of the bird at Umbagog Lake,\r\nMaine, says: “The young leave the nest in July, and for a long time\r\nthe brood remains together, being still fed by the parents. They are\r\nvery playful, sporting about the tree-trunks and chasing one another\r\ncontinually.”\r\n\r\nFrank Bolles (1892) has given a very interesting, detailed account of\r\nrearing three nestlings, about to be fledged, over a period of three\r\nand a half months. The three birds were dissimilar enough in coloring\r\nto be distinguished from one another; they proved to be two males and\r\none female; and they soon developed marked differences in conduct and\r\npersonality. Mr. Bolles at first kept them in a large cage in which\r\nthey had ample space to climb about and later allowed them to fly\r\naround a room. They became very tame, letting him handle them freely.\r\nThey subsisted almost entirely on maple syrup and water in equal parts,\r\nfed by hand at first, but in a few days they drank readily from a\r\nbasin. They caught a few flies and ate some other insects that entered\r\nthe cage, attracted by the syrup. Mr. Bolles says, however, that “the\r\nnumber of insects caught by them in this way was small, and I do not\r\nthink amounted at any time to ten percent of their food.”\r\n\r\nThe birds were lively and apparently in perfect health from the time\r\nthey were captured, July 7, until October 11, when one of them, the\r\nfemale, began to droop. Two days later she had a convulsion in the\r\nmorning and died in the afternoon. Autopsy showed that her body was\r\nwell nourished and that the organs were apparently normal except the\r\nliver, which was “very large, deeply bile-stained, and very soft.”\r\n\r\nA week later the other two birds died after exhibiting the same\r\nsymptoms as the first bird. The Department of Agriculture examined\r\nthe body of one of these birds and reported enlargement and fatty\r\ndegeneration of the liver.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolles remarks that “the most probable cause of this enlargement\r\nof the liver, which seems to have been the reason for the death of the\r\nthree sapsuckers, was an undue proportion of sugar in their diet. In\r\na wild state they would have eaten insects every day and kept their\r\nstomachs well filled with the chitinous parts of acid insects. Under\r\nrestraint they secured fewer and fewer insects, until during the last\r\nfew weeks of their lives, they had practically no solid food of any\r\nkind.”\r\n\r\nSummarizing his observations, he says:\r\n\r\n     From these experiments I draw the following conclusions:\r\n     (1), that the yellow-bellied woodpecker may be successfully\r\n     kept in captivity for a period corresponding to that\r\n     during which as a resident bird he taps trees for their\r\n     sap, sustained during this time upon a diet of which from\r\n     90 to 100 per cent is diluted maple syrup; (2), that this\r\n     fact affords evidence of an extremely strong character,\r\n     in confirmation and support of the theory that when the\r\n     yellow-bellied woodpecker taps trees for their sap he uses\r\n     the sap as his principal article of food, and not primarily\r\n     as a bait to attract insects.\r\n\r\nWinton Weydemeyer (1926) in Montana “observed a pair of red-naped\r\nsapsuckers * * * gathering sap to feed their young in the nest. A\r\nregular tree-route, followed alternately by the male and female,\r\nincluded a quaking aspen, a larger alder, and a large willow, in which\r\nborings had been made. The birds flew directly from the nest to the\r\naspen, and gathered the sap that had accumulated since the last visit;\r\nthen flew to the alder and to the willow, repeating the process;\r\nand finally flew back to the nest, without hunting for insects.\r\nOccasionally the male would vary the process by catching a few flies\r\nfrom the air, eating some and carrying some to the nest.”\r\n\r\nForbush (1927) gives the incubation period of the yellow-bellied\r\nsapsucker as “probably about 14 days.”\r\n\r\nA. Dawes DuBois furnishes the following note: “Yellow-bellied\r\nsapsuckers were observed feeding young in a nest, in Hennepin County,\r\nMinn., on July 5, 1937. The nest was about 25 feet above ground in\r\na partially dead tree at edge of willow-and-alder thicket adjoining\r\nwoods. Both parents were bringing food. The squeaky note of the young\r\nwas repeated with such regularity (about four times a second) as to\r\nindicate that only one nestling was uttering it. When the nestling was\r\nbeing fed at the entrance, by the poking method, these notes went up to\r\na higher pitch, and were sometimes choked off almost to inaudibility.\r\n\r\n“Two days later, the parents were still feeding very frequently. The\r\nmale, who on the first day had been seen to bring a bright red berry\r\nabout the size of a pea, again brought a bit of small red fruit. On one\r\noccasion, when the parents were away, the nestling put its head out\r\nof the hole; but it did not do so when being fed. In general, alarm\r\ncalls of the parents had little if any effect upon the squeaking of the\r\nnestling, though at one time, July 7, the squeaking seemed to cease for\r\na short interval when the parent gave the alarm notes. For the most\r\npart the series of squeaky notes is continuous. It was by hearing these\r\nsounds that this nest was discovered.”\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--[AUTHOR’S NOTE: The young sapsucker is hatched naked, as\r\nis the case with other woodpeckers, but the juvenal plumage is acquired\r\nbefore the young bird leaves the nest. The sexes are alike in the\r\njuvenal plumage. A young bird, not fully grown and probably not long\r\nout of the nest, taken June 25, has the black crown largely concealed\r\nby the long brownish tips of the feathers, “ochraceous-tawny” to\r\n“buckthorn brown”; each of the black feathers of the back has a large\r\nterminal spot of grayish white, or yellowish white, producing a boldly\r\nspotted pattern; the nape and sides of the neck have smaller spots of\r\nthe same color; the wings and tail are as in the adult-fall plumage;\r\nthe chin and upper throat are dull white or pale buffy brownish; the\r\nlower throat and chest are pale brownish, broken by crescentic bars of\r\ndusky; and the center of the breast and the abdomen are pale yellow\r\nor yellowish white. Changes soon begin to take place, at irregular\r\nintervals, during which the sexes begin to differentiate. Young males\r\nmay begin to show traces of red in the throat patch as early as July;\r\nand in August some may have the crown largely crimson; the black patch\r\non the chest does not usually appear until much of the red has been\r\nassumed, but some birds show considerable of both red and black before\r\nthe end of August. Other young males may not acquire much red before\r\nthe end of September. Progress toward maturity continues all through\r\nfall, winter, and early spring by protracted partial molts; probably\r\nmost individuals acquire the fully adult plumage by early spring, but\r\nI have seen birds that had not fully completed this prenuptial molt by\r\nthe end of April.\r\n\r\nYoung females follow the same sequence of molts but are somewhat later\r\nin developing the red crown, which apparently is not acquired until\r\nOctober or later. The adult body plumage of both sexes is acquired\r\nduring winter and early spring. Adults have a partial prenuptial molt\r\nabout the head and throat early in spring and a complete molt late in\r\nsummer and fall. In fresh fall plumage, the lighter markings are more\r\nor less suffused with yellowish or buffy tints, and the belly is deeper\r\nyellow.]\r\n\r\n_Food._--W. L. McAtee (1911) learned by stomach examinations that the\r\nyellow-bellied sapsucker consumed cambium and bast averaging 16.71\r\npercent of its diet. He continues:\r\n\r\n     It must be noted also that cambium is a very delicate,\r\n     perishable material, at certain times no more than a\r\n     jelly, and thus never receives a percentage valuation in\r\n     examinations of long-preserved stomachs corresponding to\r\n     its bulk when first swallowed. Neither do we get any\r\n     record of the sap consumed by these birds [the three\r\n     species of sapsucker] and they are inordinate tipplers.\r\n     Hence the value of the percentages cited lies not so much\r\n     in their accuracy as to the quantity of cambium eaten as in\r\n     the fact that they indicate a steady consumption of this\r\n     important substance. There is no doubt that cambium, bast,\r\n     and sap are depended upon by sapsuckers as stable diet.\r\n\r\nWe may get some idea of the amount of sap consumed by the bird from\r\nFrank Bolles’ (1892) record of his three young captive sapsuckers.\r\nHe says: “Ordinarily they disposed of eight teaspoonfuls [of diluted\r\nsyrup] each during the twenty-four hours. Part of this evaporated,\r\nand part was probably secured by black ants which visited the cage by\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\nBolles (1891), describing the method of feeding of birds in the wild,\r\nsays: “The dipping was done regularly and rather quickly, often two\r\nor three times in each hole. The sap glistened on the bill as it was\r\nwithdrawn. I could sometimes see the tongue move. The bill was directed\r\ntowards the lower, inner part of the drill, which, as I found by\r\nexamination, was cut so as to hold the sap.”\r\n\r\nThis is the common method of feeding, but sometimes, when two or more\r\nholes have coalesced into a vertical groove, the bird will run its bill\r\nupward along the edge of the wound, sipping the sap much as we might,\r\nwith our finger, wipe off a drop running down from a pitcher’s lip.\r\n\r\nMcAtee (1911) states that “about four-fifths of the insect food of the\r\nthree species of sapsuckers consists of ants, the eating of which may\r\nbe reckoned slightly in the birds’ favor. The remainder of the food\r\nis made up of beetles, wasps, and a great variety of other insects,\r\nincluding, however, practically no wood-boring larvae or other special\r\nenemies of trees. The birds’ vegetable food can not be cited in their\r\nbehalf, as it consists almost entirely of wild fruits, which are of no\r\nimportance, and of cambium, the securing of which results in serious\r\ndamage.”\r\n\r\nF. E. L. Beal (1895) mentions, as articles in the sapsucker’s diet,\r\nthe berries of dogwood, black alder, Virginia creeper, and wild black\r\ncherries. Winfrid A. Stearns (1883) says: “Nuts, berries, and other\r\nfruits vary its fare; and to procure these it may often be seen\r\ncreeping and hanging in the strangest attitudes among the terminal\r\ntwigs of trees, so slender that they bend with the weight of the bird.”\r\nAudubon (1842), in his plate of the sapsucker, gives an animated\r\npicture of the bird thus engaged.\r\n\r\nBrewster (1876a) shows the bird as an expert flycatcher. “From\r\nan humble delver after worms and larvae, it rises to the proud\r\nindependence of a Flycatcher, taking its prey on wing as unerringly as\r\nthe best marksman of them all. From its perch on the spire of some tall\r\nstub it makes a succession of rapid sorties after its abundant victims\r\nand then flies off to its nest with bill and mouth crammed full of\r\ninsects, principally large _Diptera_.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The sapsucker, a bird of wide distribution and in some\r\nparts of its range the commonest woodpecker, has come to be regarded\r\nwith disfavor by man, who accuses it of harming the trees it drills to\r\nobtain its food. Man accuses the bird of weakening trees by drawing\r\naway their life-blood and of killing many by girdling them with\r\nmultiple punctures, and he blames the bird for marring the beauty of\r\ntrunk and limb by pitting and scarring them.\r\n\r\nA study of the habits of the sapsucker shows that its work on the\r\ntrees varies with the season and, on the Atlantic coast, is spread\r\nover a territory 3,000 miles long or more. During the migrations,\r\nnorthward and southward, when the birds are scattered and on the\r\nmove, comparatively little harm is done. Here and there a limb may be\r\nkilled--either girdled or opened so that infection enters--and rarely a\r\ntree may die, but the chief effect is an esthetic one, the scarring of\r\nthe bark with pits, notably in orchards where it is a matter of common\r\nobservation that most of the pitted trees are in perfect health. On\r\ntheir breeding ground and in their winter quarters, however, where the\r\nbirds are concentrated and remain in one locality for a considerable\r\ntime, the effect is more serious. In the Southern States especially,\r\nthe lumber industry suffers material financial loss due to the fact\r\nthat deep in the wood cut from trees on which sapsuckers have worked\r\nextensively, when the trees were small, the grain is distorted and\r\nmade unsightly by the scars of the wounds inflicted by the birds years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nFrom an exhaustive study of the economic status of the woodpeckers\r\nby W. L. McAtee (1911), the salient points in reference to the\r\nyellow-bellied sapsucker are quoted below:\r\n\r\n     The results of sapsucker attacks on trees are so uniform\r\n     and characteristic as to be distinguished easily from the\r\n     work of other woodpeckers. Sapsucker holes are drilled\r\n     clear through the bark and cambium and often into the wood.\r\n     They vary in outline from circular to squarish elliptical,\r\n     in the latter case usually having the longer diameter\r\n     across the limb or trunk. Generally they are arranged in\r\n     rings or partial rings around the trunk, but they often\r\n     fall into vertical series. Deeply-cut holes arranged with\r\n     such regularity are made only by sapsuckers.\r\n\r\n     After the original pattern of holes is completed, the\r\n     sapsuckers often continue their work, taking out the bark\r\n     between holes until sometimes large areas are cleanly\r\n     removed. This often occurs on small limbs or trunks,\r\n     where long strips of bark up and down the tree are\r\n     removed, leaving narrow strings between. This effect is\r\n     also produced by continually enlarging single punctures\r\n     by excavating at the upper end, * * * which is done to\r\n     secure fresh inner bark and a constant supply of sap.\r\n     Occasionally, after a tree has been checkered or grooved\r\n     after the above-described systematic methods, it may be\r\n     barked indiscriminately, leaving only ragged patches of\r\n     bark. * * * Even in such cases, however, traces of the\r\n     regularly arranged punctures are likely to remain, and\r\n     there is no difficulty in recognizing the work as that of\r\n     sapsuckers, for no other woodpecker makes anything like it\r\n     on sound, living trees.\r\n\r\n     All holes, grooves, or irregular openings made by\r\n     sapsuckers penetrate at least to the outermost layer of\r\n     sapwood or nongrowing part of the tree. This results in the\r\n     removal of the exterior rough bark, the delicate inner bark\r\n     or bast, and the cambium. Since the elaborated sap (upon\r\n     which the growth of trees depends) is conveyed and stored\r\n     in these layers, it is evident that sapsuckers attack the\r\n     trees in a vital part. Each ring of punctures severs at\r\n     its particular level part of the sap-carrying vessels,\r\n     another ring made above destroys others, and so the process\r\n     continues until in extreme cases circulation of elaborated\r\n     sap stops and the tree dies. When the injury to the vital\r\n     tissues is not carried so far, only a limb here and there\r\n     may die, or the tree may only have its vitality lowered\r\n     for a few years. If the attacks cease, it may completely\r\n     recover. * * *\r\n\r\n     Recovery, however, does not mean that the tree has escaped\r\n     permanent injury. Patches of cambium of varying size may\r\n     be killed. Growth ceases at these points and the dead and\r\n     discolored areas are finally covered by wood and bark.\r\n     Until this process is completed, the tree is disfigured by\r\n     pits with dead bark and wood at the bottom, and even when\r\n     completely healed, the spot remains a source of weakness.\r\n     In fact, all sapsucker pecking is followed by more or less\r\n     rotting and consequent weakening of the wood, and renders\r\n     trees more liable to be broken by the wind or other causes.\r\n\r\n     Sapsucker injuries usually stimulate growth of the wood\r\n     layers at the points attacked, so that they become much\r\n     thicker than usual. This results in a slight swelling of\r\n     the bark, and when the birds reopen the old wounds year\r\n     after year, as they habitually do, succeeding wood layers\r\n     make excess growth and in time shelflike girdles develop.\r\n\r\nMcAtee (1911) gives a long list of trees attacked by the bird.\r\nSummarizing, he says: “Condensing the information contained in the\r\nforegoing lists, we find that the yellow-bellied sapsucker attacks no\r\nfewer than 246 species of native trees and 6 vines, besides 31 kinds of\r\nintroduced trees. Twenty-nine of these trees and 1 vine are known to be\r\nsometimes killed and 28 others are much disfigured or seriously reduced\r\nin vitality.”\r\n\r\nOf “the effects of sapsucker work on lumber and finished wood products”\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n     Those relations of sapsuckers to trees which are\r\n     detrimental to man’s interest are by no means confined to\r\n     the external disfiguration, the weakening, or killing of\r\n     trees. Indeed in the aggregate sapsuckers inflict much\r\n     greater financial loss by rendering defective the wood\r\n     of the far larger number of trees which they work upon\r\n     moderately but do not kill. Blemishes, reducing the value,\r\n     appear in the lumber from such trees and in the various\r\n     articles into which it is manufactured.\r\n\r\n     These defects consist of distortion of the grain, formation\r\n     of knotty growths and cavities in the wood, extensive\r\n     staining, fat streaks, resin deposits, and other blemishes.\r\n     All of them result from injuries to the cambium, their\r\n     variety being due to the differences in the healing.\r\n     Besides blemishes, ornamental effects are sometimes\r\n     produced during the healing of sapsucker wounds, such as\r\n     small sound stains, curly grain, and a form of bird’s-eye.\r\n\r\nMcAtee (1911) estimates that “the annual loss for the whole United\r\nStates [from the impairment of lumber] is more than a million and\r\na quarter dollars.” He continues: “Sapsuckers do not prey upon any\r\nespecially destructive insects and do comparatively little to offset\r\nthe damage they inflict. Hence the yellow-bellied sapsucker * * * must\r\nbe included in the class of injurious species.”\r\n\r\nThe situation is quite different on the breeding ground. Here the\r\nbirds resort to a group of trees, and confine their feeding activities\r\nalmost exclusively to them. Frank Bolles (1891), in his study of the\r\nbird in the region about Mount Chocorua, N. H., terms these stations\r\n“orchards.” He describes one of them as consisting “of about a dozen\r\ncanoe birches and red maples, most of which were dead, some decayed\r\nand fallen. The tree most recently tapped was a red maple about forty\r\nfeet high and two feet through at the butt.” Of another “orchard,” half\r\na mile away, he says: “The tree in use last year was nearly dead. Two\r\nneighboring birches showing scars of earlier years were quite dead.\r\nAll stood on the crest of a kame. About three rods along the ridge to\r\nthe eastward a red oak and two or three canoe birches were in use by\r\nthe birds.” This report shows that sapsuckers undoubtedly cause the\r\ndeath of many trees as they return to their “orchards” year after year,\r\nbut most of these trees are of small value, especially in the heavily\r\nforested regions where the birds commonly breed.\r\n\r\nBolles (1891) also notes the association of the sapsuckers with the\r\nruby-throated hummingbirds, which were attracted to the pits by the\r\nrunning sap. In the main, hosts and guests got along well enough\r\ntogether, although attacks occurred on both sides from time to time.\r\nHe says: “My notes refer again and again to the spiteful treatment of\r\nthe Hummers at Orchard No. 1. On the other hand at Orchard No. 2 they\r\nsay ‘Male and young one dipping. Hummer comes in and dips several times\r\n_between them_ and they offer no objection.’”\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895), half in jest, we may presume, brings an\r\naccusation of inebriety against the sapsucker in these words:\r\n\r\n     That it should be fond of the sweet sap of trees does not\r\n     surprise me, as this contains considerable nourishment,\r\n     and likewise attracts a good many insects, which the birds\r\n     eat; but it is not so easy to account for its especial\r\n     predilection for the sap of the mountain ash, which\r\n     has a decidedly bitter taste, and I believe possesses\r\n     intoxicating properties, unless it be taken for the latter\r\n     purpose; and the fact that after drinking freely of the sap\r\n     of this tree it may often be seen clinging to the trunk for\r\n     hours at a time, as if stupefied, seems to confirm this\r\n     view. It is well known that some of our birds indulge in\r\n     such disreputable practices, and possibly this species must\r\n     be included in the number, as there are sots among birds as\r\n     well as among the genus _Homo_.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Just as the sapsucker in its behavior is conspicuous, almost\r\nboisterous, at one season of the year and retiring and unobtrusive at\r\nanother, in the same way it is very noisy in spring and the early part\r\nof the nesting period and comparatively silent afterward.\r\n\r\nDr. C. Hart Merriam (1879) speaks of the bird thus: “In few species can\r\nthe date of arrival, in spring, be ascertained with such precision as\r\nin the bird now under consideration; for, no sooner are they here, and\r\nrecovered from the fatigue of their northward journey, than the country\r\nfairly resounds with their cries and drumming. * * * Noisy, rollicking\r\nfellows, they are always chasing one another among the trees, screaming\r\nmeanwhile at the top of their voices, and when three or four vociferous\r\nmales alight on the same tree, as often happens, their boisterous cries\r\nare truly astonishing.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Brewster (1876a) mentions a “peculiar snarling cry” used as an\r\nalarm note, and of a pair at the nest he says:\r\n\r\n     Watching once a nest for an hour or two, I remarked that\r\n     the birds relieved each other in the labors of incubation\r\n     at intervals averaging about half an hour each. The one\r\n     that had been absent would alight just below the hole, and,\r\n     uttering a low _yew-ick, yew-ick_, its mate would appear\r\n     from within, when, after the interchange of a few notes of\r\n     endearment, the sitting bird would fly off and the other\r\n     instantly enter the hole. * * *\r\n\r\n     Both young and old utter most frequently a low snarling cry\r\n     that bears no very distant resemblance to the _mew_ of the\r\n     Catbird. The adults have also two other notes--one, already\r\n     spoken of, when the opposite sexes meet; the other a clear,\r\n     ringing _cleur_, repeated five or six times in succession,\r\n     and heard, I think, only in the spring.\r\n\r\nOf the voice of the sapsucker, Bendire (1895) says: “Its ordinary call\r\nnote is a whining ‘whäee,’ and it utters a number of other sounds,\r\nsome of these resembling the calls of the Blue Jay, and others those\r\nof the Red-shouldered Hawk. During the mating season, when the sexes\r\nare chasing each other, a series of notes like ‘hoih-hoih,’ a number of\r\ntimes repeated, are frequently heard. Although generally disposed to be\r\nmore or less noisy, while clinging to their food trees they are always\r\nsilent as far as my observations go.”\r\n\r\nThe note mentioned above does resemble the cry of the blue jay somewhat\r\nin form, but the notes of the two birds need never be confused. The\r\nsapsucker’s may be as long as the blue jay’s, or the _caw_ of a crow;\r\nagain it may be given as a very short syllable. The note commonly\r\nis not nearly so loud as the blue jay’s and the tone of voice is\r\ndifferent; it is a complaining whine rather than a boisterous shout.\r\n\r\nAnother note, a minor note heard only when one is near the bird, is\r\nvery like the explosive _hit_ of the red-breasted nuthatch--the little\r\nconversational note that the nuthatches use as they scramble over the\r\nbark, not the nasal _toot_.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of the sapsucker’s utterances, in that it does not\r\nresemble a bird note at all, is a single syllable sounded regularly\r\nover and over again--a low-toned _tuck_, like slow, sharp strokes on\r\na nonresonant branch. This note might sometimes be mistaken for a\r\nchipmunk’s pluck, except that it lacks completely any ringing quality\r\nof tone.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The colored plates in the illustrated books on\r\nornithology lead one to expect to find the yellow-bellied sapsucker\r\nrather a brilliantly colored, conspicuous bird. However, when we meet\r\nit in the field, the colors, so bright and sharply outlined in the\r\npicture of the bird, are often dimmed by the shadows of limbs and\r\nleaves, and as the chief color is of a neutral tint, not unlike the\r\nbark of many trees, we may sometimes pass the bird by, unnoticed. Our\r\nfirst impression of the bird, when we catch a glimpse of it, is of a\r\nmedium-sized woodpecker, dull old-gold in color, and almost without\r\nmarkings. A glass, however, brings out a thin line of white along the\r\nlength of the closed wing, a red or reddish forehead and fore part of\r\nthe crown, a black mark across the upper breast, and, if we look very\r\ncarefully, a yellowish belly.\r\n\r\nW. L. McAtee (1911) points out the black mark is characteristic of\r\nnearly all sapsuckers, and he links it up pretty successfully with a\r\nred forehead. For example, The red-breasted sapsucker lacks the black\r\nmark, but has a red head; the flicker, not a sapsucker, has a “black\r\nspot on breast, but top of head from bill is not red”; the pileated\r\nwoodpecker “not a sapsucker. Entire lower parts black.” He continues:\r\n“All sapsuckers have yellow bellies, few other woodpeckers have; all\r\nsapsuckers have a conspicuous white patch on the upper part of the\r\nwing, as seen from the side when clinging to a tree; white wing patches\r\nin other woodpeckers are on the middle or lower part of the wings.\r\nThe yellow-bellied sapsucker of transcontinental range is the only\r\nwoodpecker having the front of the head (i. e., from bill to crown) red\r\nin combination with a black patch on the breast.”\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Generally when we see the yellow-bellied sapsucker in autumn,\r\nduring its slow journey toward the Southern States, it is alone. A\r\nsingle bird may settle for two or three days in our dooryard, if there\r\nbe a tree there to its liking, perching well up in it and rarely moving\r\naway. Here it is inconspicuous: its brownish color matches the bark\r\nclosely; it moves deliberately, as if to avoid notice; by hopping\r\nbehind a branch it keeps out of sight most of the time; and commonly it\r\nis perfectly silent. On occasion it makes use of its whining cry, and\r\nif two birds meet they may utter the red-breasted-nuthatch note, but as\r\na rule this woodpecker is one of the quietest of migrants.\r\n\r\nIf we watch a bird for a time, we see that it is picking at the bark,\r\ndislodging bits of it in searching for concealed food. It hops forward,\r\nbackward, and around the limbs, moving easily, taking rather long,\r\nrapid hops, seeming careless of a fall. When investigating crevices\r\nand peering under flakes of bark it cranes its neck, turning its head\r\nfrom side to side. The neck then appears constricted, like a pileated\r\nwoodpecker in miniature.\r\n\r\nAt other times it may drill holes--even the young birds of the year,\r\nwhich can have had little experience in this kind of work. They drill\r\nwith a sideways stroke, to one side, then the other, then, perhaps,\r\na stroke straight at the branch. In this manner, before very long, a\r\nsmall area is denuded of bark, the sideways strokes giving it an oval\r\nshape with the long axis parallel to the ground. However, at this\r\nseason, mid-October, in the latitude of Boston, little sap rewards\r\ntheir efforts.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Sapsuckers spend the winter mainly in the Southern States,\r\nCentral America, and on the islands south of North America, but there\r\nare a few records indicating that a bird rarely may remain nearly or\r\nquite as far north as the southern limit of the breeding range. For\r\nexample, Fred. H. Kennard (1895) reports finding one in Brookline,\r\nMass., on February 6, 1895. Collected, “he proved to be in fine, fat\r\ncondition”; and Harriet A. Nye (1918) watched, in Fairfield Center,\r\nMaine, a bird throughout the winter of 1911, in which the temperature\r\nfell to 32° below zero. Apples formed a considerable part of this\r\nbird’s diet, although he often hunted over the branches and trunks of\r\ntrees. He was last seen April 5 “as sprightly as ever.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North and Central America and the West Indies, casual in\r\nBermuda and Greenland.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--This species breeds =north= to southeastern Alaska\r\n(probably Skagway); southern Mackenzie (Nahanni Mountain, Fort\r\nProvidence, and Fort Resolution); northern Manitoba (Cochrane River\r\nand probably Fort Churchill); Ontario (Lac Seul and probably Moose\r\nFactory); Quebec (Montreal, Quebec City, Godbout, Ellis Bay, and\r\nprobably Eskimo Point); and Newfoundland (Fox Island and Nicholsville).\r\n=East= to Newfoundland (Nicholsville, Deer Lake, and Harrys River);\r\nNova Scotia (Sydney and Halifax); Maine (Bucksport and Livermore\r\nFalls); southeastern New Hampshire (Ossipee and Monadnock Mountain);\r\nwestern Massachusetts (Chesterfield); New Jersey (Midvale); and western\r\nVirginia (Sounding Knob, Cold Mountain, and White Top Mountain).\r\n=South= to southwestern Virginia (White Top Mountain); northwestern\r\nIndiana (Kouts); central Illinois (Peoria); eastern Missouri (St.\r\nLouis); Iowa (Keokuk, Grinnell, and Ogden); southeastern South Dakota\r\n(Sioux Falls and probably Vermillion); New Mexico (Pot Creek and\r\nDiamond Peak); Arizona (Buffalo Creek and Kaibab Plateau); and southern\r\nCalifornia (San Bernardino Mountains, San Jacinto Mountains, and\r\nMount Pinos). =West= to California (Mount Pinos, Big Creek, Cisco,\r\nCarlotta, and Mount Shasta); western Oregon (Prospect, Elkton, Salem,\r\nand Tillamook); Washington (Tacoma and Seattle); British Columbia\r\n(Beaver Creek, Alta Lake, and Masset); and southeastern Alaska (Craig,\r\nWrangell, and probably Skagway).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The winter range extends =north= to southwestern\r\nBritish Columbia (Comox); northeastern Oregon (Haines); central Arizona\r\n(Oak Creek); southern New Mexico (Silver City); Kansas (Wichita,\r\nTopeka, and Bendena); Missouri (Lexington and Nelson); Illinois\r\n(Bernadotte and Mount Carmel); southern Indiana (Vincennes and probably\r\nBloomington); southern Ohio (Hamilton and Hillsboro); northern Maryland\r\n(Hagerstown); southeastern Pennsylvania (Edge Hill); and southern New\r\nJersey (Newfield). From this point the species is found in winter\r\n=south= along the Atlantic coast to southern Florida (Miami, Royal Palm\r\nHammock, and Key West); the Bahama Islands (Nassau, Watling Island, and\r\nGreat Inagua); and the northern Lesser Antilles (St. Croix). =South=\r\nto the Lesser Antilles (St. Croix); rarely Haiti (Gonave Island);\r\nand rarely Costa Rica (Coli Blanco and Punta Arenas). From this\r\nsouthwestern point the winter range extends northward along the western\r\ncoast of Central America (including Baja California) to California;\r\nOregon; rarely Washington; and southwestern British Columbia (probably\r\nBarkley Sound and Comox). In the eastern part of the country the\r\nspecies is found irregularly =north= to southern Wisconsin (Madison);\r\nsouthern Michigan (Ann Arbor and Detroit); southern Ontario (London and\r\nLindsay); southern Vermont (Bennington); and central Maine (Fairfield\r\nand Dover).\r\n\r\nThe range as above outlined covers the entire species, which has been\r\nseparated into four subspecies or geographic races. The typical form,\r\nknown as the yellow-bellied sapsucker (_S. v. varius_), is found during\r\nthe breeding season over all the northern parts of the range east of\r\nAlaska and south to Missouri and the mountains of western Virginia. In\r\nwinter it is found south to Central America and the West Indies. The\r\nred-naped sapsucker (_S. v. nuchalis_) is found chiefly in the Rocky\r\nMountain region from central British Columbia south (in winter) to Baja\r\nCalifornia and central Mexico. The northern red-breasted sapsucker (_S.\r\nv. ruber_) breeds from southeastern Alaska south through the mountains\r\nto western Oregon and in winter to central California. The southern\r\nred-breasted sapsucker (_S. v. daggetti_) is confined to the mountains\r\nof California and northern Baja California.\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--Early dates of spring arrival are: Quebec--\r\nMontreal, March 25; Westmount, March 30.

He also noted it in 1875. A specimen was found dead at\r\nJulianshaab, Greenland, in July 1845; another was obtained in that\r\ngeneral region about 1858; and an adult female was collected at Loup\r\nBay, Labrador, on May 5, 1899.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--Alberta: 19 records, May 20 to June 18; 10 records,\r\n    May 30 to June 11, indicating the height of the season.\r\n  California: 13 records, May 12 to June 21; 7 records, May 30 to\r\n    June 9.\r\n  Colorado: 19 records, May 27 to June 15; 10 records, June 4 to 12.\r\n  Illinois: 5 records, April 20 to June 3.\r\n  Nova Scotia: 14 records, May 28 to June 15; 7 records, June 5 to 10.\r\n  Oregon: 24 records, May 12 to June 12; 12 records, May 25 to June 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SPHYRAPICUS VARIUS NUCHALIS Baird\r\n\r\n                          RED-NAPED SAPSUCKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe western race of the eastern yellow-bellied sapsucker occupies an\r\nextensive range in the general region of the Rocky Mountains, chiefly\r\neast of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Ranges, from central British\r\nColumbia and Alberta to western Texas and Arizona.\r\n\r\nRidgway (1914) gives a full description of this form, which is worth\r\nquoting in view of his remarks as to its status; he describes it as--\r\n\r\n     Similar to _S. v. varius_, but with much less white on\r\n     back, this forming two definite but broken stripes,\r\n     converging posteriorly; nape always with more or less of\r\n     red, under parts less strongly tinged with yellow, and wing\r\n     and tail averaging decidedly longer; adult male with red\r\n     of throat more extended, both laterally and posteriorly,\r\n     covering malar region (except anterior portion), where\r\n     meeting white sub-auricular stripe; adult female with at\r\n     least lower half of throat red (sometimes whole throat red,\r\n     only the chin being white); young much darker above than\r\n     corresponding stage of _S. v. varius_, the pileum dark\r\n     sooty slate, white markings on back less brownish, and\r\n     under parts much less yellowish, the chest and foreneck\r\n     brownish gray or grayish brown (instead of buffy brown),\r\n     and usually less distinctly barred or lunulated with dusky.\r\n\r\n     On account of the conspicuous difference in coloration\r\n     of the young, definite difference in color pattern of\r\n     back, head, and neck in adults, and comparative rarity\r\n     of intermediate specimens (which are far less common,\r\n     relatively, than in the case of _Colaptes_), I believe that\r\n     it would be better to consider this form as specifically\r\n     distinct from _S. varius_. It is true that specimens do\r\n     occur that are intermediate between _S. nuchalis_ and _S.\r\n     varius_, as well as between the former and if _S. ruber_;\r\n     but they may be (and I believe they are) hybrids; certainly\r\n     there is no more reason for not considering them as such\r\n     than in the case of _Colaptes_; and if _S. nuchalis_ is to\r\n     be considered as merely a subspecies of _S. varius_ then,\r\n     most certainly, must _S. ruber_ also.\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgway (1877) says of its haunts:\r\n\r\n     Throughout the country between the Sierra Nevada and the\r\n     Rocky Mountains, the red-naped woodpecker is a common\r\n     species in suitable localities. Its favorite summer-haunts\r\n     are the groves of large aspens near the head of the upper\r\n     cañons, high up in the mountains, and for this reason we\r\n     found it more abundant in the Wahsatch and Uintah region\r\n     than elsewhere; indeed, but a single individual was\r\n     observed on the Sierra Nevada, and this one was obtained on\r\n     the eastern slope of the range, near Carson City. It was\r\n     very rare throughout western Nevada, but became abundant\r\n     as we approached the higher mountains in the eastern\r\n     portion of the State. Among the aspen groves in Parley’s\r\n     Park, as well as in similar places throughout that portion\r\n     of the country, it was by far the most abundant of the\r\n     Woodpeckers; and it seemed to be as strictly confined to\r\n     the aspens as _S. thyroideus_ was to the pines.\r\n\r\nThe Weydemeyers (1928) say that, in northwestern Montana, “it occurs\r\nmost abundantly and typically in mixed broad-leaf and conifer\r\nassociations along streams, where it nests regularly. It ranges less\r\ncommonly into virgin forests of fir, larch, yellow pine, and hemlock\r\n(_Tsuga heterophylla_) in the valleys; and into arborvitae, lodgepole\r\npine, and spruce woods of the foothills. Occasional birds are seen\r\nin alpine fir and spruce woods upward to the lower borders of the\r\nHudsonian zone.”\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--M. P. Skinner says in his notes: “On May 13, 1915, I\r\nsaw a red-naped sapsucker drumming on a hollow, dead lodgepole pine;\r\nsoon he flew to the top of another pine, where his mate was, and\r\nthe two began bobbing and curtsying in true cake-walk fashion much\r\nlike flickers, except that these sapsuckers were on a vertical stub.\r\nThere was no movement of the feet, but the body was bent from side to\r\nside, and there was a constant ‘juggling’ motion. The head was tilted\r\nback and the bill pointed up at an angle of sixty degrees, with neck\r\noutstretched. The neck, head, and bill were in constant motion. That of\r\nthe bill reminded me of a musical director’s baton.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The Weydemeyers (1928) say of its nesting habits: “As\r\nelsewhere in the state, this bird in Lincoln County nests most commonly\r\nin live aspens. Our records for this area include four nests in live\r\naspens, one in a live larch, and one in a dead Engelmann spruce. These\r\nnests were all in the Transition zone, near streams, Three of the\r\nnests in aspens were in a single tree, in successive years. Nest-hole\r\npreparation usually commences immediately upon the arrival of the birds\r\nin the spring, about April 20.”\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) gives an attractive account of finding a nest of\r\nthis woodpecker in a live aspen, in a small grove of these trees, near\r\nCamp Harney, Oregon, on June 12, 1877: “Their nesting site was directly\r\nover my head, about 20 feet from the ground. * * * The entrance to the\r\nexcavation was exceedingly small, not over 1¼ inches in diameter, about\r\n8 inches deep, and about 4 inches wide at the bottom. It contained\r\nthree nearly fresh eggs, lying partly embedded in a layer of fine\r\nchips.”\r\n\r\nHe quotes the following observations of Denis Gale:\r\n\r\n     My observations have been that this subspecies invariably\r\n     selects for its nesting site a living aspen tree. I have\r\n     never met with it in any other. This tree favors the\r\n     mountain gulches and low, sheltered hillsides, at an\r\n     altitude of from 7,000 to 10,000 feet. Above this point\r\n     they do not attain sufficient size, and are mostly dwarfed\r\n     and scrubby. Here in Colorado _Sphyrapicus varius nuchalis_\r\n     is seldom found above 9,000 feet or much below 8,000 feet.\r\n     The aspen tree is short lived, and ere much of a growth is\r\n     attained, a cross section, in the majority of instances,\r\n     will show a discolored center of incipient decay, involving\r\n     half or two-thirds of its entire diameter, with a sound,\r\n     white sap zone on the outer circumference, next to the\r\n     bark. This sound, healthy zone nourishes the tree until the\r\n     decayed core discovers itself in some withered limbs, and\r\n     frequently the top of the tree manifests the canker.\r\n\r\n     Such trees the Red-naped Sapsucker selects for its nesting\r\n     site, and with great perseverance chisels through this\r\n     tough, sound zone, from 1 to 1½ inches in thickness,\r\n     commencing with a very small hole and gradually extending\r\n     its circumference with each stage of the deepening\r\n     process, working from the lowest center out, till the\r\n     exact circumference of the intended aperture of entrance\r\n     is attained. In thus radiating in circles from the central\r\n     point the minute chips are chiseled out with considerable\r\n     ease. This mode of working is observed until the tough zone\r\n     is worked through; what remains then is comparatively easy\r\n     work; the soft, soggy, lifeless inside is worked into and\r\n     downward with greater facility, and a roomy, gourd-shaped\r\n     excavation quickly follows, the female doing the excavating\r\n     from beginning to end, and, according to exigencies,\r\n     completes it in from six to ten days. * * *\r\n\r\n     _Sphyrapicus varius nuchalis_ usually insists upon a new\r\n     excavation each year. The height of the nesting sites from\r\n     the ground varies from 5 to 30 feet; the full set of eggs\r\n     is four or five in number; sometimes a smaller number of\r\n     eggs mark a full set, presumably the nest of one of last\r\n     year’s birds. Fresh eggs may be looked for in Colorado from\r\n     June 1 to 15, and should the first set be taken, a second\r\n     one may generally be found from ten to fifteen days later;\r\n     and, as a rule, the second nesting site will not be greatly\r\n     distant from the first one. Several nests of this species\r\n     may be found within a short distance of each other in the\r\n     same aspen grove.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Major Bendire (1895) says of the eggs: “The number of eggs\r\nto a set varies from three to six, usually four or five; these are\r\nmostly ovate in shape, a few are more elliptical ovate; they are pure\r\nwhite in color; the shell is fine grained and moderately glossy.” The\r\nmeasurements of 40 eggs average 22.89 by 17.28 millimeters; the eggs\r\nshowing the four extremes measure =24.38= by 16.76, 23.60 by =18.50=,\r\n=20.83= by 16.76, and 21.34 by =16.26= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Major Bendire (1895) says: “I believe that both sexes assist\r\nin the labor of excavating the nesting site, the female appearing to\r\ndo the greater part of the work, however, which is frequently very\r\nlaborious, and that the male also shares the duties of incubation,\r\nwhich lasts about fourteen days.”\r\n\r\n_Food._--Again, he writes: “Its general habits are similar to those\r\nof the preceding species [yellow-bellied sapsucker], and in the\r\nfruit-growing sections within its range, in southern Utah, for\r\ninstance, it is said to do considerable damage to the orchards in the\r\nearly spring and again in the fall, tapping the peach and apple trees\r\nfor sap in the same manner as _Sphyrapicus varius_ does in the East.\r\nIts principal food consists of small beetles, spiders, grasshoppers,\r\nants, and such larvæ as are to be found under the loose bark of trees,\r\nas well as wild berries of different kinds.”\r\n\r\nW. L. McAtee (1911) gives a long list of trees that are attacked by\r\nthis species of sapsucker, among which this western race is charged\r\nwith doing considerable damage to many western trees, such as various\r\npines, spruces, hemlocks, firs, redwood, cedars, cypresses, junipers,\r\ncottonwoods, aspens, willows, bayberry, walnuts, hophornbeam, white\r\nalder, oaks, laurels, sycamores, mahoganies, pears, apples, cherries,\r\nmesquite, ironwood, maples, _Ceanothus_, _Fremontia_, western dogwood,\r\nmadrona, buckthorn, ashes, and probably others.\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph Grinnell (1914) says, referring to the Colorado Valley,\r\nwhere this sapsucker was evidently wintering among the willow thickets:\r\n“Willows were the trees attacked by this woodpecker; but in one case a\r\nsingle large mesquite, and the only one of many in the vicinity, had\r\nbeen selected for bleeding, and its main trunk and larger branches were\r\nplentifully bored. I visited this tree many times during the space of\r\nthree days, March 2 to 4, opposite The Needles, and invariably found a\r\nsapsucker working about the borings. I shot two of the birds at this\r\nmesquite, and there was still one there the last time I visited the\r\ntree, although I had never seen but one at a time there.”\r\n\r\nW. L. Dawson (1923) remarks: “In lieu of maple sap the western bird\r\nmakes heavy requisition on the fresh-flowing pitch of pine and fir\r\ntrees. As for cambium, that of the aspen (_Populus tremuloides_) has\r\nmarked preference, and the summer range of the bird, so far as it goes,\r\nis practically controlled by the occurrence of the tree. Inasmuch\r\nas this tree is short-lived and of slight economic importance, the\r\ndepredations of the bark-eaters are not seriously felt.”\r\n\r\nMr. Skinner says, in his Yellowstone Park notes: “I have seen the\r\nred-naped sapsucker pick and hammer on dead aspens and on the trunks of\r\nlodgepole pine for insects. On June 28, 1917, I saw one make frequent\r\nflycatcher-like sallies from an aspen out into the open.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--John H. Flanagan (1911) witnessed a rather remarkable\r\nperformance by a red-naped sapsucker, such as I had not seen recorded\r\nelsewhere. He had chopped out a nest containing two fresh eggs and\r\nwas intending to leave them for a possible addition to the set, as he\r\nhad done successfully before, when one of the birds, “both of which\r\nremained in sight, flew to the tree, perched a moment upon the edge of\r\nthe cut hole, then went in, and shortly reappeared with one of the eggs\r\nin its beak. It flew to a nearby stub, not more than forty feet from\r\nwhere” he “was sitting, calmly devoured the egg and dropped the empty\r\nshell.”\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Apparently the fall migration of this woodpecker consists\r\nlargely of a withdrawal from the high altitudes, in which it breeds, to\r\nwinter resorts in the lowlands. Major Bendire (1895) says: “During the\r\nwinter months, I have occasionally observed a red-naped sapsucker in\r\nthe Harney Valley, in Oregon, busily engaged in hunting for food among\r\nthe willow thickets found growing along the banks of the small streams\r\nin that sagebrush-covered region, often long distances away from timber\r\nof any size.”\r\n\r\nDr. Grinnell (1914) noted it, as a winter visitant, among the willows\r\nand mesquites in the lower Colorado Valley. And M. French Gilman\r\n(1915), referring to the Arizona lowlands, says: “The red-naped\r\nsapsucker (_Sphyrapicus varius nuchalis_) is a winter visitant along\r\nthe Gila River, and while not to be called abundant, is frequently\r\nnoticed. I have seen individuals from October 6 to as late as April 17,\r\nand in all the months between these two dates. Once I saw three in one\r\nmesquite tree. Signs of their work are frequently present on cottonwood\r\nand willow trees and occasionally on an Arizona ash. If there are any\r\nalmond trees in the country they are sure to be attacked, as they are\r\nfavorites with these birds. Only once or twice have I seen mesquite\r\ntrees attacked.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SPHYRAPICUS VARIUS DAGGETTI Grinnell\r\n\r\n                    SOUTHERN RED-BREASTED SAPSUCKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe above name was applied to this sapsucker by Dr. Joseph Grinnell\r\n(1901) and was characterized by him as smaller and paler than the\r\nnorthern race and with a maximum extent of white markings. It is\r\nevidently a well-marked race. But whether the red-breasted sapsucker\r\nshould be considered a subspecies of the yellow-bellied sapsucker\r\nseems to me to be a decidedly open question, on which authorities seem\r\nto have differed, or to have changed their minds. In support of his\r\nviews, Dr. Grinnell (1901) says: “I have examined a number of skins of\r\nthe _nuchalis_ type, and others approaching _ruber_ in almost every\r\ndegree, and I am certain that there is a continuous intergradation\r\ngeographically between the eastern _S. varius_ and _ruber_ of the\r\nPacific Coast. The intermediates do not appear to be the result of\r\n‘hybridization’ and the case does not seem to be at all parallel to\r\nthat of _Colaptes auratus_ and _C. cafer_. Therefore I see no reason\r\nwhy the Red-breasted Sapsucker is of more than subspecific rank.”\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that Ridgway used the name _Sphyrapicus\r\nvarius ruber_ in 1872 and again in 1874 (Ridgway, 1914, in synonymy),\r\nbut 40 years later (1914) he gave the red-breasted sapsucker full\r\nspecific rank, apparently having changed his mind. And, in the same\r\nwork, in a footnote under the red-naped sapsucker, referring to the\r\nintergrades mentioned by Dr. Grinnell, he says: “But they may be (and\r\nI believe are) hybrids; certainly there is no more reason for not\r\nconsidering them as such than in the case of _Colaptes_.”\r\n\r\nCertainly the red-breasted sapsucker and the yellow-bellied sapsucker\r\nare as much unlike in appearance as the two flickers; and the hybrid\r\nflickers certainly show “every degree” of intergradation. In the large\r\nseries of sapsuckers that I have examined, containing 87 typical\r\n_ruber_ and 86 typical _nuchalis_, I was able to find only 8 specimens\r\nthat could, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered as\r\nintermediates; I believe that these intergrading sapsuckers will prove\r\nto be relatively less common than are the hybrids between the two\r\nflickers.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, too, to note that the first three editions of the\r\nA. O. U. Check-List, 1886, 1895, and 1910, all gave the red-breasted\r\nsapsucker full specific rank, in spite of the fact that Ridgway had\r\ncalled it a subspecies of the yellow-bellied in 1872, and Grinnell\r\nhad done the same in 1901. But the fourth edition, 1931, adopts the\r\nsubspecies theory, in spite of Ridgway’s latest decision.\r\n\r\nThe southern race of the red-breasted sapsucker breeds in the Canadian\r\nand Transition Zones in the mountains of California, from the Trinity\r\nand Warner Mountains southward to the San Jacinto Mountains. Grinnell\r\nand Storer (1924) say that it “is found in the main forest belt during\r\nthe spring, summer, and fall, but regularly performs an altitudinal\r\nmigration which carries it down into the tree growths of the western\r\nfoothills and valleys for the winter months.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Very little seems to have been published on the nesting\r\nhabits of this sapsucker, which probably do not differ materially from\r\nthose of its northern relative, about which more seems to be known.\r\nWright M. Pierce (1916) located one of its nests in the San Bernardino\r\nMountains, on June 26, of which he says: “The cavity was in the dead\r\ntop of a large live silver fir about forty-five feet up. The cavity\r\nhad a small opening and was only 5 or 6 inches deep; diameter, inside,\r\n1½ or 2 inches. The nest held two large young and one smaller dead\r\none. It was hard to see how more than one bird could survive in such a\r\nsmall space, so it was not surprising that the probably weaker bird had\r\napparently been suffocated.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The red-breasted sapsucker lays usually four or five eggs,\r\nsometimes as many as six. Like all woodpeckers’ eggs, they are pure\r\nwhite, usually with very little or no gloss, and they vary from ovate\r\nto rounded-ovate. The measurements of 13 eggs average 23.79 by 17.25\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =24.6= by 17.0,\r\n23.81 by =17.86=, =22.5= by 17.5, and 24.5 by =16.6= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Incubation is said to last about 14 days; this duty and the\r\ncare of the young is shared by both parents. Mrs. Irene G. Wheelock\r\n(1904) says of a nest that she watched: “Incubation began May 30, and\r\nlasted fifteen days. The young were fed by regurgitation for the first\r\ntwo weeks. * * *\r\n\r\n“The young sapsuckers left the nest on the seventh of July, and clung\r\nto the nest tree for three days. Here they were initiated by both\r\nparents into the mysteries of sap-sucking. A hole having been bored\r\nin front of each, with grotesque earnestness the mother watched the\r\nattempt to drink the sweet syrup. During this time both insects and\r\nberries were brought to them by the adults, in one hour one youngster\r\ndevouring twelve insects that looked like dragonflies.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Florence M. Bailey (1902) writes:\r\n\r\n     The last week in July at Donner Lake we found a family\r\n     of dull colored young going about with their mother, a\r\n     handsome old bird with dark red head and breast. They flew\r\n     around in a poplar grove for a while, and then gathered in\r\n     a clump of willows, where four young clung to the branches\r\n     and devoted themselves to eating sap. The old bird flew\r\n     about among them and seemingly cut and scraped off the bark\r\n     for them, at the same time apparently trying to teach them\r\n     to eat the sap for themselves; for though she would feed\r\n     them at other times she refused to feed them there, and\r\n     apparently watched carefully to see if they knew enough to\r\n     drink the sap. When the meal was finally over and the birds\r\n     had flown, we examined the branch and found that lengthwise\r\n     strips of bark had been cut off, leaving narrow strips like\r\n     fiddle-strings between. At the freshly cut places the sap\r\n     exuded as sweet as sugar, ready for the birds to suck.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--Like other young sapsuckers, the young of this species\r\nare hatched naked, but the juvenal plumage is acquired before they\r\nleave the nest. In the juvenal plumage, in which the sexes are alike,\r\nthe wings and tail are essentially as in the adult; the head and neck,\r\nexcept for the white stripe below the eye, are dark grayish sooty,\r\nthough the forehead and crown are usually more or less tinged with dull\r\nred; the sides and flanks are more or less barred with dull gray and\r\nwhite; and the abdomen is dull yellowish white.\r\n\r\nBy the last of July, or first of August, the molt into the first winter\r\nplumage begins, with an increasing amount of red coming in on the\r\ncrown, throat, and breast; at the same time the yellow of the abdomen\r\nbecomes brighter. This molt continues through fall and is often not\r\ncomplete until November or later. The young bird is now much like the\r\nadult. In fall birds, both adult and young, the red of the head and\r\nbreast, is much duller than in spring, “Brazil red” to “dragon’s blood\r\nred” in the fall, and “scarlet red” or bright “scarlet” in the late\r\nwinter and spring; this is due, of course, to the wearing away of the\r\ntips of the feathers; in early summer, just before molting, the red is\r\ndecidedly brilliant.\r\n\r\nAdults have a complete annual molt, beginning sometimes in July and\r\nlasting through August or later.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The food of the red-breasted sapsucker is much like that of\r\nits close relatives in the _varius_ group. M. P. Skinner writes to\r\nme: “I have found red-breasted sapsuckers drilling on cottonwoods,\r\nwillows, yellow pines, and lodgepole pines; but all the actual feeding\r\nI have seen was on willows. Mr. Michael tells me that these birds work\r\nlargely on the apple trees that have been planted in various parts of\r\nthe Yosemite Valley. When a sapsucker is at its wells, it takes a sip\r\nnow and then, but considerable time is used in watchful guarding, or in\r\ndriving away intruders or would-be robbers. In the case of such wells\r\nas I found on willow stems, I could see no established regularity in\r\narrangement. They looked as if the bark had been irregularly scaled\r\noff. In fact, such work may be necessary to secure the inner bark; yet\r\nthe birds actually took sap at such wells. One had a dozen willow stems\r\non which it drilled and sipped in succession; each one was only a few\r\ninches from the next; and the bark of each, both above and below the\r\nwells, was worn smooth. This bird went from well to well in regular\r\norder, then back to the first well to begin again. Although sap formed\r\nthe bulk of their food in August, I have seen them also searching the\r\nbark for insects during that same month.”\r\n\r\nMcAtee (1911) lists the following trees that are attacked by the\r\nred-breasted sapsucker: Cottonwoods, willows, walnuts, birches, oaks,\r\nbarberry, sycamore, mountain-ash, pears, apples, peaches, plums,\r\napricot, orange, pepper, and blue gum (_Eucalyptus_). Emanuel Fritz\r\n(1937) has, on several occasions, found this sapsucker attacking\r\nredwood trees. “In each instance the individual tree was ‘peppered’\r\nwith holes in horizontal rows, from the base to the top. In virgin\r\ntimber, it is only an occasional tree that is attacked, and one\r\nsearches in vain for another victim in the general vicinity. * * *\r\n\r\n“During the present year, the writer came upon his first example of\r\nsapsucker work on so-called second-growth redwood. * * * The sapsuckers\r\nattacked every tree in two groups, or families, of sprouts.”\r\n\r\nW. L. Dawson (1923) writes:\r\n\r\n     The red-breasted sapsucker does puncture trees and drink\r\n     sap both in summer and winter. In summer it attacks in this\r\n     fashion not only pine, fir, aspen, alder, cottonwood and\r\n     willow trees, but such orchard trees as apple, pear, prune\r\n     and the like, as may lie within Transition areas. In winter\r\n     at lower levels it gives attention to evergreen trees,\r\n     white birch, mountain ash, peach, plum, apricot, English\r\n     walnut, elder, and pepper trees. * * * Instead of gleaning\r\n     at random, as we might expect, the Sapsucker makes careful\r\n     selection, like a prudent forester, of a single tree, and\r\n     confines his attentions henceforth, even though it be\r\n     through succeeding seasons, to that one tree. Starting well\r\n     toward the top of an evergreen, or well up on the major\r\n     branches of an orchard tree, the bird works successively\r\n     downward in perpendicular rows, whose borings are sometimes\r\n     confluent. In this way the bird secures an ever-fresh flow\r\n     of sap, from below. If carried on too extensively, or\r\n     persisted in for successive seasons, these operations will\r\n     sometimes cause a tree to bleed fatally, or at least to\r\n     fall easy victim to insect pests. I have myself seen limbs\r\n     of mountain ash trees, pear trees, and English walnut, done\r\n     to death in this fashion. Yet it is only fair to say that\r\n     but one or two trees in an orchard may be attacked, and\r\n     there is scarcely more danger of the trouble spreading than\r\n     there would be from successive strokes of lightning. * * *\r\n\r\n     For the rest, _Sphyrapicus ruber_ is a large consumer of\r\n     ants, and does some good in the destruction of leaf-eating\r\n     beetles. Berries of the pepper trees (_Schinus molle_) are\r\n     eaten to some extent, in winter, as are also, regrettably,\r\n     seeds of the poison oak.\r\n\r\nW. Otto Emerson (1893) says: “One I watched every morning from my\r\ntent fly to the top of a tall burnt tree and rap its roll-call as a\r\nkind of warning may be to the flying insects. It would then sail out\r\nlike a flycatcher, catch an insect, and return to the burnt tree-top.\r\nIts movements were very graceful and regular. As it dipped or circled\r\naround for this or that insect the sunlight catching on the red breast\r\nlit it up like a patch of flame.” He says elsewhere (1899): “One I\r\nfound in a willow tree trying to get the best of a yellow jacket’s\r\nnest, dodging back and forth either to get a mouthful of their stored\r\nsweets or the jackets themselves.”\r\n\r\nJunius Henderson (1927) gives, in his table, the percentages of animal\r\nand vegetable food, exclusive of sap, taken by this sapsucker. Based on\r\na study of 34 stomachs the total animal food made up 69 percent and the\r\ntotal vegetable food 31 percent of the whole; 42 percent consisted of\r\nants and 12 percent of fruits, mostly wild; insects accounted for 11\r\npercent and seeds for 5 percent.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Grinnell and Storer (1924) write:\r\n\r\n     The Sierra red-breasted sapsucker is in our experience\r\n     well-nigh voiceless and its work is done in such a quiet\r\n     manner that it does not ordinarily attract attention, as do\r\n     the woodpeckers that are wont to pound noisily. The most\r\n     vigorous drilling of the sapsucker will scarcely be heard\r\n     more than a hundred feet away. The bird moves its head\r\n     through a short arc, an inch or two at the most, giving\r\n     but slight momentum to the blows. The chips cut away are\r\n     correspondingly small, mere sawdust as compared with the\r\n     splinters or slabs chiseled off by other woodpeckers. The\r\n     strokes are delivered in intermittent series, four or five\r\n     within a second, then a pause of equal duration, then\r\n     another short series, and so on. From time to time a longer\r\n     pause ensues, when the sapsucker withdraws its bill and\r\n     gazes monocularly at the work.\r\n\r\nMr. Skinner says, in his notes: “Although methodical, these birds\r\nseem quite nervous, moving from stem to stem. Generally they perch\r\nlengthwise of a limb when working or feeding but are apt to perch\r\ncrosswise when hopping from limb to limb. After a sapsucker has its\r\nwells established, it finds it necessary to stay near to guard them\r\nfrom other birds attracted by the sap, or by the insects drawn there.\r\nPreening is often done while guarding the wells. The hairy woodpeckers\r\nchase these sapsuckers from tree to tree. The Audubon and lutescent\r\nwarblers literally swarm to the sap-wells in the willows whenever\r\nthe sapsuckers cease to guard them, but I do not know that there is\r\nactive antagonism between the species. On one occasion, I saw a young\r\nsapsucker chase off a chipmunk that came too near.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Ralph Hoffmann (1927) says that “the ordinary cry is a nasal\r\nsqueal, _chée-arr_, somewhat suggesting the note of a red-bellied\r\nhawk.” But it is apparently not a noisy bird, as Grinnell and Storer\r\n(1924) say that it is “well-nigh voiceless”.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The red head and breast of the adult are unmistakable\r\nand very conspicuous. The young bird might be mistaken for the young of\r\nthe red-naped sapsucker, as they are much alike, but the head of the\r\nred-breasted sapsucker is darker and often shows dull red. The broad,\r\nwhite band in the wing is conspicuous while the bird is perched or when\r\nflying; this is common to both adults and young, but the red-naped\r\nsapsucker has a very similar white band.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Mr. Dawson (1923) writes: “Sapsuckers are more extensively\r\nmigratory than any other woodpeckers, save _Colaptes_, but _ruber’s_\r\nmigrations are chiefly altitudinal. Retirement from the untenable\r\nheights is quite irregular, and dependent upon weather conditions. The\r\nwinter distribution, also, appears somewhat irregular and haphazard.\r\nThe bird is very quiet and rather stolid in winter, as becomes a bird\r\nof high feather. It is, however, quite as likely to be seen in a city\r\npark or on a shaded avenue as in a foothill forest.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SPHYRAPICUS VARIUS RUBER (Gmelin)\r\n\r\n                    NORTHERN RED-BREASTED SAPSUCKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe northern race of the red-breasted sapsucker breeds from Alaska\r\nsouthward to western Oregon, chiefly in the Canadian Zone. Ridgway\r\n(1914) says that it is “similar to” the southern race, “but slightly\r\nlarger and with coloration darker and brighter; the red of the head,\r\nneck, and chest averaging brighter, and whitish spots on back usually\r\nsmaller (sometimes obsolete).”\r\n\r\nBendire (1895) says of its haunts:\r\n\r\n     Throughout its range I think this species breeds frequently\r\n     at lower altitudes than _Sphyrapicus varius nuchalis_.\r\n     Fort Klamath, however, although but 4,200 feet above sea\r\n     level, has a very cool summer climate, frosts occurring in\r\n     almost every month in the year. The surrounding country\r\n     is very beautiful at that time. Heavy, open forests of\r\n     stately pines and firs, among these the graceful and\r\n     beautiful sugar pine, are found on the mountain sides and\r\n     reaching well down into the green, park-like valleys.\r\n     Interspersed here and there are aspen groves of various\r\n     extent, their silvery trunks and light-green foliage\r\n     blending artistically with the somber green of the pines.\r\n     These aspen groves are the summer home of the Red-breasted\r\n     Sapsucker.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--In the vicinity of Fort Klamath, Oreg., Bendire (1895) found\r\nthis sapsucker to be “an abundant summer resident” and says:\r\n\r\n     They are among the earliest birds to arrive in the spring.\r\n     The first bird of this species shot by me, in the spring\r\n     of 1883, was obtained on March 13, and I have seen a few\r\n     as late as November. On one of my collecting trips, the\r\n     morning of April 4, 1883, while riding through a patch of\r\n     pine timber, near Wood River, the principal stream running\r\n     through the center of Klamath Valley, I noticed a flock\r\n     of these birds, at least twenty in number. They were very\r\n     noisy, apparently glad to get back to their summer homes,\r\n     and seemed to have an excellent time generally, flying from\r\n     tree to tree and calling to each other.\r\n\r\n     As I wanted a couple of specimens, I was compelled to\r\n     disturb their jollification; those procured were both\r\n     males, and presumably the entire flock belonged to this\r\n     sex. By April 20 they had become very common, and some\r\n     pairs at least were mated and had already selected their\r\n     future domiciles, in every case a good-sized live aspen\r\n     tree. The males might at that time be heard in almost all\r\n     directions drumming on some dry limb, generally the dead\r\n     top of one of these trees. They scarcely seemed to do\r\n     anything else.\r\n\r\nNesting.--He says of the nesting habits in the Klamath Valley:\r\n\r\n     As far as my own observations go, healthy, smooth-barked\r\n     aspens are always selected as suitable nesting sites by\r\n     these birds. The trees used vary from 12 to 18 inches in\r\n     diameter near the ground, and taper very gradually. The\r\n     cavity is usually excavated below the first limb of the\r\n     tree, say from 15 to 25 feet from the ground. The entrance\r\n     hole seems to be ridiculously small for the size of the\r\n     bird--perfectly circular, from 1¼ to 1½ inches in\r\n     diameter only--so small, indeed, that it seems as if it\r\n     took considerable effort for the bird to squeeze himself in\r\n     and wriggle out of the hole.\r\n\r\n     The gourd-shaped excavation varies in depth from 6 to 10\r\n     inches, and it is from 3 inches near the top to 4 or 5\r\n     inches wide at the bottom. The finer chips are allowed to\r\n     remain in the bottom, forming the nest proper, on which\r\n     the eggs are deposited. Frequently they are more than\r\n     half covered by these chips. The interior of the entire\r\n     excavation is most carefully smoothed off, which must\r\n     consume considerable time, considering the tough, stringy,\r\n     and elastic nature of the wood when filled with sap, making\r\n     it even more difficult to work when partly decayed, which\r\n     seems to be the case with nearly all the aspens of any\r\n     size. Probably eight or ten days are consumed in excavating\r\n     a satisfactory nesting site. All the larger and coarser\r\n     chips are dropped out of the hole and scattered about the\r\n     base of the tree.\r\n\r\nJohnson A. Neff (1928) says: “The nests of these birds are placed in\r\nwhatever trees are abundant in their vicinity. In Klamath County, in\r\nthe foothills and in the lower valleys, alders, cottonwoods and aspens\r\nwere utilized; in the higher altitudes, firs were the common site,\r\nwith the alder and willow along the small streams. In the Willamette\r\nValley the firs, cottonwoods, willows, alders, and others, are used\r\nindiscriminately.”\r\n\r\nNear Blaine, Wash., Mr. Dawson (Dawson and Bowles, 1909) found an\r\nalmost inaccessible nest of this sapsucker 50 feet from the ground in a\r\nbig fir stub, “sixteen feet around at the base, above the root bulge,\r\nand perfectly desolate of limbs.” He managed to reach the nest with the\r\nhelp of a rope and cleats nailed on the barkless trunk. He says:\r\n\r\n“By the time I had a hole large enough to thrust in the hand, the\r\neggs were quite buried in chips and rotten wood. But when they were\r\nuncovered, they were seen to lie, seven of them, in two regular lines,\r\nfour in the front rank with sides touching evenly, and three in the\r\nrear with points dove-tailed between.”\r\n\r\nHarry S. Swarth (1924) also found some lofty nests in the Skeena River\r\nregion of northern British Columbia; he writes: “During May and June\r\na number of nests were found, mostly through seeing the old birds\r\ncarrying food to the young. One was drilled in a live poplar, the tree\r\na straight column with no branching limb save at the very top, the nest\r\nsome seventy feet from the ground. Another was in a dead birch, sixty\r\nfeet up. Many others were noted, all in birch or poplar, mostly dead\r\ntrees, and no nest was less than fifty feet above the ground. One male\r\nbird collected had the abdomen bare of feathers. It obviously had been\r\nincubating eggs.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The red-breasted sapsucker lays four to seven eggs, usually\r\nfive or six. Bendire (1895) describes them, as follows: “The eggs,\r\nwhen fresh and before blowing, like those of all Woodpeckers, show the\r\nyolk through the translucent shell, giving them a beautiful pinkish\r\nappearance, as well as a series of straight lines or streaks, of a\r\nmore pronounced white than the rest of the shell, running toward and\r\nconverging at the smaller axis of the egg. After blowing, the pink\r\ntint will be found to have disappeared and the egg changed to a pure,\r\ndelicate white, the shell showing a moderate amount of luster. There is\r\nconsiderable variation in their shape, running as they do through all\r\nthe different ovates to an elongated ovate.”\r\n\r\nThe measurements of 54 eggs average 23.61 by 17.51 millimeters; the\r\neggs showing the four extremes measure =25.40= by 17.78, 24.13 by\r\n=18.54=, =21.84= by 17.27, and 23.11 by =16.26= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Mr. Neff (1928) lists 67 species of fruit, forest, and\r\nornamental trees and shrubs that are known to have been tapped by\r\nthe red-breasted sapsucker, showing that this species is not at all\r\nparticular as to what kind of sap it drinks. A total of 64 stomachs\r\nwere examined, representing every month in the year. “The stomach\r\nanalyses revealed 40.7 percent of vegetable food, and 52.53 percent\r\ninsect food.” Ants formed the bulk of the insect food, running as\r\nhigh as 80 percent in July; other items were boring beetles and their\r\nlarvae, other beetles, weevils, caddiceflies, aphids, various flies,\r\nmites, and spiders. Fruit averaged less than 4 percent of the food and\r\nincluded elderberries, wild cherries, haw and dogwood berries. “No\r\ncultivated fruits were taken and seeds were almost a minus quantity.\r\nTrue cambium or soft inner bark averaged 31.35 percent; most of\r\nthis was taken between October and April. Other bark, fibre, and\r\nmiscellaneous vegetable matter averaged 5.14 percent.”\r\n\r\nBendire (1895) says: “Their food consists principally of grubs, larvæ\r\nof insects, ants, various species of lepidoptera, which they catch\r\non the wing, like Flycatchers, and berries. * * * They seem to be\r\nespecially fond of wild strawberries.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Charles A. Allen, of Nicasio, Calif., wrote to Major\r\nBendire (1895): “These Woodpeckers are very fond of hanging to\r\ntelegraph poles, and may be found drumming along the line of the\r\nCentral Pacific Railroad through the Sierra Nevadas, where you can hear\r\nthem beating a tattoo for hours at a time. If you try to approach one,\r\nas soon as a certain distance is reached the bird will sidle to the\r\nopposite side of the pole, and then keep peeping around the corner at\r\nwhatever has excited his suspicions, and as soon as it thinks it has a\r\ngood opportunity to escape it will fly away with a shrill cry, and keep\r\nthe pole in line between it and yourself for protection. Here they are\r\nvery shy, and remain very quiet if discovered.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Bendire’s own experience--\r\n\r\n     “These birds are not at all shy during the breeding season,\r\n     allowing you to approach them closely; but they have an\r\n     extraordinarily keen sense of hearing. I frequently tried\r\n     to sneak up to a tree close to my house which I knew had\r\n     been selected by a pair of these birds, to watch them at\r\n     work, but I was invariably detected by the bird, no matter\r\n     how carefully I tried to creep up, before I was able to get\r\n     within 30 yards, even when she was at work on the inside of\r\n     the cavity and could not possibly see me. The bird would\r\n     cease working at once, her head would pop out of the hole\r\n     for an instant, and the surroundings would be surveyed\r\n     carefully. If I kept out of sight and perfectly still, she\r\n     would probably begin working again a few minutes afterward,\r\n     but if I moved ever so little, without even making the\r\n     least noise, in my own estimation, she would notice it and\r\n     stop working again at once. If the tree were approached\r\n     too closely, she would fly off, uttering at the same time\r\n     a note resembling the word ‘jay,’ or ‘chäe,’ several times\r\n     repeated, which would invariably bring the male around\r\n     also, who had in the meantime kept himself busy in some\r\n     other tree, either drumming or hunting for food. While the\r\n     female was at work on the inside of the excavation the male\r\n     would fly to the entrance, from time to time, and look in;\r\n     * * * and at other times he would hang, for five or ten\r\n     minutes even, just below the entrance to the burrow, in a\r\n     dreamy sort of study, perfectly motionless and seemingly\r\n     dazed.”\r\n\r\nMr. Neff (1928) writes:\r\n\r\n     They have not been found to be particularly quiet excepting\r\n     during the hotter summer months. At other times they have\r\n     been neither noticeably noisy nor silent. The outstanding\r\n     features of their behavior have proven to be pugnacity and\r\n     noise during the mating season and while incubating and\r\n     feeding the young, and an extreme curiosity at other times.\r\n     In many instances the writer has located them by utilizing\r\n     this curiosity; sitting motionless on a log or rock after\r\n     failing to find them, any sapsucker in the community\r\n     would soon make its presence known by a characteristic\r\n     interrogative call, at first from a distance, gradually\r\n     drawing nearer.\r\n\r\n     In winter they seem to be quite belligerent, for on several\r\n     occasions one has been located by the angry noise as if\r\n     of a pitched battle; on closer investigation it would be\r\n     found that the sapsucker was attempting to drive some other\r\n     woodpecker, generally the Gairdner, from some favorite tree.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Bendire (1895) says: “While the nest was being rifled of its\r\ncontents both parents flew about the upper limbs of the tree, uttering\r\na number of different sounding, plaintive sounds, like ‘peeye,’\r\n‘pinck,’ and ‘peurr,’ some of these resembling somewhat the purring of\r\na cat when pleased and rubbing against your leg. I used to note the\r\ndifferent sounds in a small notebook at the very time, but scarcely\r\never put them down alike; each time they appeared a trifle different to\r\nthe ear, and it is a hard matter to express them exactly on paper.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dawson (Dawson and Bowles, 1909) says that while he was chopping\r\nout the nest the birds “made frequent approaches from a neighboring\r\ntree, crying _kee-a, kee-aa_, in helpless bewilderment. * * * When all\r\nwas over, they raised a high, strong _qué-oo,--qeé-oo_, never before\r\nheard, and reminding one generically of the Red-headed Woodpecker of\r\nboyhood days.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              SPHYRAPICUS THYROIDEUS THYROIDEUS (Cassin)\r\n\r\n                        WILLIAMSON’S SAPSUCKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nWilliamson’s sapsucker is not only one of our most unique woodpeckers\r\nin its striking coloration, but it has an interesting history. Owing\r\nto the radical difference in appearance between the two sexes, they\r\nwere for some time regarded as two distinct species. The female was\r\nthe first to be described by John Cassin (1852, p. 349), based on a\r\nspecimen collected by John G. Bell in Eldorado County, Calif. Under\r\nthe name black-breasted woodpecker (_Melanerpes thyroideus_), Cassin\r\ndescribes and figures (1854) the adult female as the male of the\r\nspecies and says of the female: “Similar to the male, but with the\r\ncolors more obscure, and the black of the breast of less extent and not\r\nso deep in shade,” which is a very fair description of the immature\r\nfemale. The male was discovered and described and figured by Dr.\r\nNewberry (1857, p. 89, pl. 34) under the name _Picus williamsonii_,\r\nbased on a specimen collected by him on August 23, 1855, on the shores\r\nof Klamath Lake, Oreg. Baird, Cassin, and Lawrence (1860) give a very\r\ngood description of an adult male, as the male of the species, but say\r\n“female with the chin white instead of red,” which, of course, is the\r\nimmature male. Thus we have the adult of each sex regarded as the male\r\nof a species, and the young bird of each sex regarded as the female\r\nof a species. With careless, or improper, sexing of specimens, such\r\nan error might easily occur, but it is remarkable that it remained so\r\nlong undiscovered. Baird, Cassin, and Lawrence (1860) describe the male\r\nas _Sphyrapicus williamsonii_ Baird, Williamson’s woodpecker, and the\r\nfemale as _Sphyrapicus thyroideus_ Baird, brown-headed woodpecker. J.\r\nG. Cooper (1870), in the Geological Survey of California, edited by\r\nBaird, follows the same error but calls the female the round-headed\r\nwoodpecker. Even Baird, Brewer, and Ridgway, in their history of\r\nNorth American Birds, had not discovered the error, for they use\r\nsubstantially the same nomenclature.\r\n\r\nIt remained for Henry W. Henshaw (1875) to discover the true\r\nrelationship of the two supposed species and clear up the previous\r\nmisunderstanding. He writes: “While near Fort Garland, I obtained\r\nabundant proof of the specific identity of the two birds in question;\r\n_williamsonii_ being the male of _thyroideus_. Though led to suspect\r\nthis, from finding the two birds in suspicious proximity, it was some\r\ntime before I could procure a pair actually mated. A nest was at length\r\ndiscovered, excavated in the trunk of a live aspen, and both the parent\r\nbirds were secured as they flew from the hole, having just entered with\r\nfood for the newly hatched young.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgway (1877) comments on the discovery as follows:\r\n\r\n     A suspicion that the two might eventually prove to be\r\n     different plumages of one species several times arose in\r\n     our mind during the course of our field-work, the chief\r\n     occasion for which was the very suggestive circumstance\r\n     that both were invariably found in the same woods, and\r\n     had identical manners and notes, while they also agreed\r\n     strictly in all the details of form and proportions, as\r\n     well as in the bright gamboge-yellow color of the belly.\r\n     Our theory that _thyroideus_ was perhaps the _young_, and\r\n     _williamsoni_ the _adult_, proved erroneous, however; and\r\n     it never occurred to us that the differences might be\r\n     sexual, an oversight caused chiefly by the circumstance\r\n     of our having seen in collections many specimens of\r\n     _thyroideus_ with a red streak on the throat and marked\r\n     as males, while the type specimen of _williamsoni_ had a\r\n     white streak on the throat and was said to be a female. We\r\n     were thus entirely misled by the erroneous identification\r\n     of the sex in these specimens. We gave the matter up,\r\n     however, only after shooting a very young specimen of what\r\n     was undoubtedly _williamsoni_, and another of _thyroideus_,\r\n     both of which very closely resembled the adults of the\r\n     same forms, a circumstance which at once convinced us that\r\n     the differences could not depend on age; so we finally\r\n     concluded that the two must be distinct.\r\n\r\nAll observers seem to agree that this woodpecker is confined to the\r\nhigher elevations in the mountains among the pines, in sharp contrast\r\nto the haunts of the red-breasted sapsucker at lower levels among the\r\ndeciduous trees.\r\n\r\nJoseph Grinnell (1908), referring to the San Bernardino Mountains,\r\nin southern California, says: “This Williamson sapsucker appeared to\r\nbe restricted to the Canadian zone and upper edge of Transition. We\r\nfound it only among the tamarack pines on the slopes and ridges of San\r\nGorgonio peak, and among the silver firs, tamarack and yellow pines\r\naround Bluff lake. In the former locality the species was common for\r\na woodpecker, especially around Dry Lake, 9,000 feet altitude, where\r\nseveral nests were found.”\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Charles W. Michael (1935) noted the mating behavior of a\r\nmale Williamson’s sapsucker, which had just left a fresh nest-hole, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     He sounded his harsh call several times. Seemingly in\r\n     answer to his call the female appeared. This was the\r\n     first we had seen of the female. The female examined the\r\n     nest hole, flew up on a branch and uttered a series of\r\n     low notes. The male joined her, alighting a foot away and\r\n     uttering a series of low chuckling notes. While giving\r\n     these notes he strutted along the limb with wing-tips\r\n     and tail jerking rapidly. As he approached his mate\r\n     she crouched low on the limb and the mating act was\r\n     accomplished. The act lasted several seconds before the\r\n     birds separated to perch side by side on a limb. After a\r\n     minute or so the female flew off through the woods and the\r\n     male went into the nest hole. In about five minutes the\r\n     female came to the nest hole and again uttered her soft\r\n     coaxing notes. The male came out of the hole and both birds\r\n     flew to a limb where again the mating act was consummated.\r\n     The male returned to the nest. In our two-hour watch the\r\n     female only went to the nest hole to call the mate out.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Dr. Grinnell (1908) says of its nesting in the San\r\nBernardino Mountains:\r\n\r\n     Tamarack pines were selected as nest trees, usually old\r\n     ones with the core dead and rotten but with a live shell\r\n     on the outside. In one found June 22, 1905, there were\r\n     four holes drilled one above the other about eighteen\r\n     inches apart, and one of these holes contained three small\r\n     young and two infertile eggs. * * * Later on in the same\r\n     day another nest was found similarly located containing\r\n     four half-fledged young. A nest with half-grown young was\r\n     found in the same locality, June 14, 1906; and on June\r\n     26 of the same year a nest twenty feet up in a half-dead\r\n     tamarack held five two-thirds-grown young and one rotten\r\n     egg. So that a full set of eggs probably varies from four\r\n     to six in number. On June 18, 1907, a nest with small\r\n     young was located ten feet up in an exceptionally large\r\n     nearly dead tamarack pine. This was one of the lowest of a\r\n     series of forty-seven well-formed holes of similar external\r\n     appearance, which penetrated this one tree trunk on all\r\n     sides up to an estimated height of thirty-five feet.\r\n\r\nW. L. Dawson (1923) writes: “One soon comes to recognize the rigid\r\nrequirements of the Williamson Sapsucker in the matter of nesting\r\nsites. Given a pine which is beginning to die at the top, usually in\r\na fairly sheltered situation, and a pair of birds will adopt it for\r\na permanent home. They will occupy it from year to year, or perhaps\r\nthe year around, nesting twice in a season; and a long occupation is\r\nevinced by a trunk riddled with holes at all levels. One such ‘family\r\ntree,’ closely examined, had 38 holes, apparently complete and fit for\r\nhabitation or incubation. At the time of our visit, on June 19th, the\r\nmale was industriously drilling a new excavation at a height of 45\r\nfeet.”\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) says:\r\n\r\n     I obtained my first set of eggs of this species on June 3,\r\n     1883, about 9 miles north of Fort Klamath, in the open pine\r\n     forest on the road to Crater Lake. It consisted of five\r\n     eggs, slightly incubated. The nesting site was excavated\r\n     in a partly decayed pine whose entire top for some 20 feet\r\n     was dead; the height of the excavation from the ground was\r\n     about 50 feet. The man climbing the tree reported it to be\r\n     about 8 inches deep and about 5 inches wide at the bottom,\r\n     and freshly made. A second set, of six fresh eggs, was\r\n     taken June 12 of the same year, about 12 miles north of\r\n     the Post, at a still higher altitude than the first one.\r\n     It came also out of a pine about 40 feet from the ground.\r\n     A third nest, found a week later, near the same place,\r\n     contained five young, just hatched. This nest was in a\r\n     dead aspen, about 20 feet from the ground. Only one brood\r\n     is raised, and, like the other two species, it is only a\r\n     summer resident in the vicinity of Fort Klamath.\r\n\r\nOther observers have found nests in lodgepole pines, red firs, and\r\nlarches at various heights from 5 to 60 feet above ground but always in\r\nconifer associations.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Bendire (1895) says: “The number of eggs laid to a set varies\r\nfrom three to seven, sets of five or six being most often found. These,\r\nlike all woodpecker’s eggs, are pure china-white in color; the shell\r\nis close grained, rather thin, and only slightly glossy. In shape\r\nthey vary from ovate to elongate ovate, and a few approach an ovate\r\npyriform, a shape apparently not found in the eggs of other species\r\nof this genus.” The measurements of 30 eggs average 23.54 by 17.23\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =25.91= by\r\n17.27, 24.1 by =18.3=, and =20.1= by =15.4= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Both parents assist in the duties of incubation, but\r\nthe length of time required for this function does not seem to be\r\ndefinitely known; both sexes also help in feeding the young. Dr. J.\r\nC. Merrill (1888) says, of two nests that he watched for some time:\r\n“The males brought food about twice as often as did the females, and\r\nfrequently removed the excrement of the young on leaving the nest,\r\nalighting on the nearest tree for a moment to drop it and to clean\r\ntheir bills; I did not see either of the females remove any excreta.\r\nAbout four feet above one of the holes was another occupied by a pair\r\nof pigmy nuthatches, but neither species paid any attention to the\r\nother when they happened to arrive with food at the same time.”\r\n\r\nDr. Grinnell (1908) writes: “We usually located the nests by watching\r\nthe movements of the parent birds, which flew from their foraging\r\nplaces, often far distant, direct to the nest tree. The young uttered\r\na whinnying chorus of cries when fed, and the adults, though generally\r\nvery quiet, had a not loud explosive cry, more like the distant squall\r\nof a red-tailed hawk. The bill and throat of an adult male, shot as it\r\nwas approaching a nest, was crammed with large wood ants, not the kind,\r\nhowever, that are common at lower altitudes and smell so foully.”\r\n\r\nCharles W. Michael (1935) watched a nest containing young, in the\r\nYosemite region, of which he says:\r\n\r\n     When we arrived, about ten o’clock, both parent birds were\r\n     bringing food. We watched the birds for an hour and a half\r\n     and in this period of time the male made nine trips to the\r\n     nest hole and the female made seven trips. The young were\r\n     small, as the parent birds went completely into the nest\r\n     hole. The birds, male and female, always came onto the tree\r\n     trunk above the nest hole and hitched jerkily downward\r\n     until on a level with the hole. They landed anywhere\r\n     between five and fifteen feet above the hole; the female\r\n     was likely to land nearest to the hole. * * * About every\r\n     other trip excrement was carried from the nest. When the\r\n     male cleaned nest he carried the feces away and dropped\r\n     them some distance from the nest. When the female cleaned\r\n     nest she came to the entrance from within, looked about and\r\n     then dropped the refuse before leaving the nest hole.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The most remarkable characteristic of this woodpecker is\r\nthe striking difference in the plumages of the two sexes at all ages,\r\nfrom the first plumage of the young bird to its maturity; in most\r\nbirds the sexes are much alike in the juvenal plumage; but the young\r\nmale Williamson’s sapsucker is much like the adult male, and the young\r\nfemale is much like the adult female; the principal character common to\r\nboth sexes at all ages is the white rump.\r\n\r\nThese young sapsuckers are fully fledged before they leave the nest.\r\n\r\nThe young male, in juvenal plumage in summer, differs from the adult\r\nmale in having a smaller and weaker bill and softer, more blended\r\nplumage; the black areas, except the wings and tail, which are like\r\nthose of the adult, are dull brownish black, instead of clear glossy\r\nblack; there are usually numerous elongated white spots or streaks,\r\nmore or less concealed, on the scapulars and upper back, and often a\r\nfew small whitish spots on the crown; the chin and upper throat are\r\nwhite, instead of scarlet; the center of the breast and abdomen is dull\r\nyellowish white, instead of bright “lemon-chrome”; the sides and flanks\r\nare barred, instead of striped or spotted, with dusky.\r\n\r\nThe young female differs from the adult female in having a smaller and\r\nweaker bill and softer plumage; the black breast patch is entirely\r\nlacking; the breast, sides, and flanks are barred with dusky, but less\r\ndistinctly than in the adult; and the yellow of the central breast and\r\nabdomen is much paler.\r\n\r\nThese two juvenal plumages are worn for only a short time in summer. I\r\nhave seen young males molting into their first winter plumage, which\r\nis practically adult, as early as August 9; and young females begin\r\nto show the increasing black breast patch as early as August 6; but\r\nthis molt is slow, or variable, and is sometimes not completed until\r\nNovember or December.\r\n\r\nAdults apparently have their complete annual molt mainly in August and\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Mrs. Florence M. Bailey (1928) says: “In 17 stomachs examined,\r\n87 percent was animal matter and 13 percent vegetable. Of the animal\r\ncontents, 86 percent was ants, and cambium made up 12.55 percent of the\r\ntotal food.”\r\n\r\nGrinnell and Storer (1924) write:\r\n\r\n     In the Yosemite region the Williamson Sapsucker is closely\r\n     associated with the lodgepole pine. While this tree\r\n     seems to furnish the bird’s preferred source of forage,\r\n     practically all other species of trees within its local\r\n     range are also utilized. We saw workings attributable to\r\n     this sapsucker on the alpine hemlock, red and white firs,\r\n     Jeffrey pine, and quaking aspen.\r\n\r\n     The amount of work which this sapsucker will do upon\r\n     a single tree was impressed upon us while we were at\r\n     Porcupine Flat in early July, 1915. In that locality there\r\n     was a lodgepole pine (_Pinus murrayana_) about 60 feet\r\n     high, which showed no marks of sapsucker work previous to\r\n     the current year. The tree was in full leafy vigor and\r\n     measured 8 feet 3¼ inches in girth at 3 feet above the\r\n     ground. There were numerous live branches down to within 6\r\n     feet of the ground. Twenty-six irregularly horizontal rows\r\n     of fresh punctures were counted on one side of the trunk,\r\n     the lowest being only 18½ inches above the ground, and the\r\n     highest about 40 feet. * * *\r\n\r\n     During the winter months when sap is practically at a\r\n     standstill in the coniferous trees at high altitudes, the\r\n     Williamson Sapsucker must needs seek other fare. A few of\r\n     our own observations added to those of other naturalists\r\n     suggest that during the winter season the birds may forage\r\n     in a large part on dormant insects or on insect larvae\r\n     hidden in crevices in the bark. If such is the case,\r\n     whatever the damage done by these birds to the forest as a\r\n     whole during the summer months, it is partially offset by\r\n     their wintertime activity. In any event, the attacks of the\r\n     Williamson Sapsucker on the lodgepole pines of the central\r\n     Sierra Nevada cannot be considered as of great economic\r\n     importance, for these trees are there used little if at all\r\n     for lumber or for any other commercial purpose.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Dr. J. C. Merrill (1888), at Fort Klamath, Oreg., found\r\nthis sapsucker “shy and very suspicious. A noticeable habit here is\r\nthe frequency with which it works down as well as up a trunk, and when\r\none dodges around a tree, in which, by the way, it is unpleasantly\r\nexpert, it is as apt to reappear twenty feet below where it was last\r\nseen, as above. In searching for food it will often work up and down a\r\nfavorite tree repeatedly. In all its movements it is quick and active,\r\nand gives one the impression of being thoroughly wide awake, which\r\nimpression the would-be collector is speedily convinced is correct.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Mr. Michael (1935) says: “When the sapsuckers met at the\r\nnest site they exchanged greetings in a ‘rubber doll’ tone of voice.\r\nThe nasal quaver of notes was remindful of a call often sounded by the\r\nred-breasted sapsucker. Another call that was occasionally shouted from\r\nthe tree-tops was shrill and like that of a red-tailed hawk.”\r\n\r\nDr. Elliott Coues (1874) says: “It has an abrupt, explosive outcry,\r\nmuch like that of other species of Woodpeckers, and also an entirely\r\ndifferent call note. This sounds to me like a number of rolling _r’s_,\r\nbeginning with a gutteral _k--k’-r-r-r_--each set of _r’s_ making a\r\nlong syllable. This note is leisurely given, and indefinitely repeated,\r\nin a very low key.”\r\n\r\nGrinnell and Storer (1924) describe the voice as “a weak wheezy _whang_\r\nor _whether_.”\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--Such a conspicuously and uniquely colored woodpecker\r\nas the male Williamson’s sapsucker should be easily recognized; its\r\ngeneral appearance is largely black, with a large white patch in the\r\nfore part of the wing, and another on the rump and upper tail coverts;\r\nthe yellow on the under parts is not so easily seen; neither is the red\r\nthroat. The female appears mainly pale brown, with a white rump, brown\r\nhead, and barred back and wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Mountainous regions of the Western United States and\r\nsouthwestern Canada south to west-central Mexico.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--Williamson’s sapsucker breeds =north= to central\r\nWashington (Bumping Lake and probably Dayton); and southwestern\r\nMontana (Missoula, Pipestone Creek, Bridger Creek, and Red Lodge).\r\n=East= to Montana (Red Lodge); Wyoming (Yellowstone National Park and\r\nLaramie Peak); Colorado (Estes Park, Idaho Springs, Breckenridge, El\r\nPaso County, and Fort Garland); and New Mexico (Carson Forest, Santa\r\nFe Canyon, Las Vegas, and Hermosa). =South= to southern New Mexico\r\n(Hermosa); Arizona (Tucson, Mogollon Mountains, and Fort Whipple); and\r\nsouthern California (San Jacinto). =West= to eastern California (San\r\nJacinto, San Bernardino Mountains, Pyramid Peak, Tuolumne County, Echo\r\nLake, Lake Tahoe, Lassen Peak, and Eagle Peak); western Oregon (Rogue\r\nRiver Valley and Foley Springs); and west-central Washington (Bumping\r\nLake).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--In winter the species is regularly found =north= to\r\ncentral California (Yosemite Valley); central Arizona (Pine Springs,\r\nOak Creek, and Mogollon Mountains); southwestern New Mexico (Black\r\nRange); and central Texas (San Angelo). =East= to Texas (San Angelo and\r\nprobably Kerrville); eastern Chihuahua (Apache); and Jalisco (Bolanos\r\nand Guadalajara). =South= to southern Jalisco (Guadalajara). =West=\r\nto Jalisco (Guadalajara); northwestern Durango; western Chihuahua\r\n(Refugio, Casa Colorado, Bavispee River, and Colonia Garcia); northern\r\nBaja California (San Pedro Martir, Ville de la Trinidad, and Hanson\r\nLagoon); and California (Pasadena and Yosemite Valley).\r\n\r\nAs outlined, the range applies to the entire species, which has been\r\nseparated into two subspecies. True Williamson’s sapsucker (_S. t.\r\nthyroideus_) is found in the Pacific coast region from British Columbia\r\nsouth to Baja California, while Natalie’s sapsucker (_S. t. nataliae_)\r\ninhabits the Rocky Mountain region from Montana south to Jalisco.\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--Although the species appears to be resident\r\nthroughout considerable portions of its range, and but little is known\r\nof its migratory movements, the following early dates of arrival have\r\nbeen noted: Colorado--Boulder County, April 5; Colorado Springs, April\r\n5; Evergreen, April 8; Denver, April 15. Wyoming--Yellowstone Park,\r\nApril 29. Montana--Charcoal Gulch, April 23. Nevada--Carson City, March\r\n10. Washington--Pullman, April 26. A late date of departure from the\r\nsouthern part of the winter range is Chihuahua, Palomas Lakes, April 7.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--Available late dates of fall departure are:\r\nWashington--Copper River, September 3. Oregon--Rustler Peak,\r\nNovember 6. Nevada--Lee Canyon, October 7; Carson City, November 27.\r\nMontana--Fort Custer, September 9. Wyoming--Yellowstone Park, September\r\n22; Wheatland, October 4. Colorado--Del Norte, September 5; Rio Blanco,\r\nSeptember 9; Boulder County, November 6. It has been noted to reach\r\nHanson Lagoon, Baja California, on October 11.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--There are a few records in extreme southern British\r\nColumbia, where it may breed occasionally. A pair were collected on\r\nApril 22, 1913, on Schoonover Mountain, near Okanagan Falls; one was\r\ntaken at Similkameen in June 1882, while Swarth (1917) records three\r\nfrom Midway.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--California: 14 records, May 27 to June 26.\r\n  Colorado: 29 records, May 24 to June 24; 15 records, June 1 to 8,\r\n    indicating the height of the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              SPHYRAPICUS THYROIDEUS NATALIAE (Malherbe)\r\n\r\n                          NATALIE’S SAPSUCKER\r\n\r\n                               PLATE 29\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nHarry S. Swarth (1917) is responsible for the recognition of this race,\r\nwhich seems to differ from the Williamson’s sapsucker of the Pacific\r\ncoast in the same way that the northern white-headed woodpecker differs\r\nfrom the southern race of that species; he says:\r\n\r\n     The differences are as worthy of recognition in one case\r\n     as in the other. It is my suggestion here that the Rocky\r\n     Mountain race of the Williamson Sapsucker be separately\r\n     recognized on the basis of its lesser bill measurements as\r\n     compared with those of _Sphyrapicus thyroideus thyroideus_\r\n     of the Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\n     As regards a name for this form, there is already one that\r\n     seems to be clearly available for use. A specimen from\r\n     Mexico was designated by Malherbe (Journ. für Orn., 1854,\r\n     p. 171) as _Picus nataliae_, and an example from any part\r\n     of Mexico (save possibly from the mountains of northern\r\n     Lower California) would assuredly be of the Rocky Mountain\r\n     subspecies. Also in the measurements given by Malherbe,\r\n     length of bill (“du bec, du front 20 millimeters”) places\r\n     his bird unequivocally with this race.\r\n\r\n     It is reasonably certain that in the Rocky Mountain\r\n     region the species does not breed south of the Mogollon\r\n     Divide, though it does occur as a common winter visitant\r\n     in southern Arizona and over a large part of the Mexican\r\n     plateau. These winter visitants, as shown by numerous\r\n     specimens at hand, are migrants from the Rocky Mountain\r\n     region to the northward, and not from the Pacific Coast\r\n     region. So the name _nataliae_, as given by Malherbe to a\r\n     Mexican specimen, can safely be used for the Rocky Mountain\r\n     subspecies, which may therefore stand as _Sphyrapicus\r\n     thyroideus nataliae_ (Malherbe).\r\n\r\nMrs. Florence M. Bailey (1928), referring to the striking difference in\r\nplumage between the male and the female in this species, remarks:\r\n\r\n     The cause of this strongly contrasted sexual coloration\r\n     unique among the woodpeckers of the United States is one\r\n     of the unsolved problems of ornithology that stimulates\r\n     speculation and so adds zest to the study. Is it, as Mr.\r\n     Swarth suggests, that the female is still in a primitive\r\n     stage of development? Correlating the brown coloration of\r\n     the pasture-frequenting flickers with the ant-eating habits\r\n     so marked in the Rocky Mountain sapsucker, it would seem\r\n     that the color of the female might have been ancestrally\r\n     adapted to a more open habitat than that in which the pair\r\n     are found today; or has the ant-eating habit been diverted\r\n     from ants that live on the ground in the open to those that\r\n     live on tree trunks? The feeding habits of the anomalous\r\n     pair should be carefully studied in the field.\r\n\r\nDr. Edgar A. Mearns (1890b) says that in Arizona it “breeds very\r\ncommonly at the highest altitudes, frequenting the spruce and fir\r\nwoods. It seldom descends far into the pine belt during the breeding\r\nseason, although it is found in the pines in winter, occasionally\r\ndescending even to the cedars in severe weather; and after the nesting\r\nseason it frequently roves down to the pine woods with its young. When\r\nshot, it usually fastened its claws into the balsam bark and remained\r\nhanging there after life was extinct.”\r\n\r\nMilton P. Skinner says in his Yellowstone Park notes: “In this Park,\r\nthe Williamson sapsucker lives below 7,000 feet and prefers mixed\r\nforests of aspen and fir, but it is not particular whether in dense\r\nforest or in the borderland between forest and open.”\r\n\r\n_Spring._--Mr. Swarth (1904) witnessed a well-marked spring migration\r\nin the Huachuca Mountains, Ariz., of which he says:\r\n\r\n     On April 6, 1902, I saw about a dozen Williamson Sapsuckers\r\n     near the summit of the mountains at an altitude of about\r\n     9,000 feet. Though not at all in a compact flock they\r\n     seemed to keep rather close together, and when one flew\r\n     any distance away, the others soon followed. The bulk of\r\n     them were females, and but one or two males were seen, one\r\n     of which was, with great difficulty secured, for they were\r\n     very wild. On April 9 several more were seen and a female\r\n     secured at this same place; and a male was taken a mile\r\n     or two from this place, at an altitude of nearly 10,000\r\n     feet. These were the last I saw in the spring, though they\r\n     do occur later as I have a female that was taken in the\r\n     Huachucas by H. Kimball on April 20, 1895.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The nesting habits of this woodpecker do not seem to differ\r\nmaterially from those of the species elsewhere. Bendire (1895) quotes\r\nW. G. Smith, as follows: “Williamson’s Sapsucker is a common summer\r\nresident in Estes Park, Colorado, where it nests mostly in dead pines,\r\noften within a few feet of the ground, and again as high as 70 feet\r\nup. Full sets of fresh eggs are usually found here during the first\r\nweek in June. The male appears to me to do most of the incubating, and\r\nhereabouts it is most often found at altitudes between 7,000 and 8,000\r\nfeet, but I have also taken it at much higher ones, where it nests\r\nsomewhat later.”\r\n\r\nMr. Skinner says in his notes: “On June 14, 1914, I discovered the nest\r\nof a pair of Williamson sapsuckers in the gulch beside the trail to\r\nSnow Pass at the beginning of the last ascent. The nest was in an aspen\r\ntrunk about 6 inches in diameter. The opening to the nest was 1½ inches\r\nin diameter and located 5 feet above ground. On June 30, 1915, the nest\r\nwas in the same tree, but 2 feet above the 1914 nest and in a fresh\r\nopening.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The eggs of Natalie’s sapsucker do not differ materially from\r\nthose of the other race of the species. The measurements of 51 eggs\r\naverage 23.60 by 17.41 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes\r\nmeasure =26.2= by 17.9, 24.2 by =19.4=, =21.5= by 17.0, and 22.0 by\r\n=16.0= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Mr. Skinner says in his notes that the young “seem to arrive\r\nirregularly between June 10 and July 1. I have seen young Williamson’s\r\nsapsuckers hunting by themselves before August 10. In the nest recorded\r\nabove there were five young on June 14, 1914, and both parents were\r\nkept constantly busy bringing food, and frequently came so fast that\r\none parent had to wait for the other to leave the nest. In feeding the\r\nyoung the adults disappeared completely into the nest cavity and came\r\nout head first. In 1915 there were five more young on June 30 and they\r\nwere still there on July 10. When I visited them on June 30, the male\r\nwas in the nest, and it required about five raps on the tree trunk to\r\ndislodge him, although he came to the opening and looked out at each\r\nrap.”\r\n\r\n_Food._--The feeding habits of Natalie’s sapsucker are apparently\r\nsimilar to those of the species elsewhere, but Mr. Skinner tells me\r\nhe has “seen it drumming on firs for insects, picking insects from a\r\ncrotch of a lodgepole pine and catching spruce-budworm moths from fir\r\nfoliage.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The feeding and other habits of Natalie’s sapsucker seems\r\nto be similar to those of the other subspecies, but Bendire (1895)\r\nquotes the following notes from Denis Gale, about its behavior around\r\nthe nest, which are worth repeating here:\r\n\r\n     A marked peculiarity I have noted with _Sphyrapicus\r\n     thyroideus_ is that the male takes a lookout station upon\r\n     some suitable tree, where, at the approach of any possible\r\n     danger, he gives the alarm by striking a short dry limb\r\n     with his bill, by which a peculiar vibrating sound is given\r\n     out, which the female, not very distant, fully understands,\r\n     and is at once on the alert. If either excavating,\r\n     guarding, or covering her eggs, she will immediately look\r\n     out of her burrow, and, should the intruder’s path lie in\r\n     the direction of her nest, she will silently slip away\r\n     and alight in a tree some distance off, but in view of\r\n     both her nest and the intruder. The first or second blow\r\n     of a hatchet upon the tree trunk in which the nest is\r\n     excavated will mark her movement again by a short flight,\r\n     so managed as not to increase the distance--in fact oftener\r\n     coming nearer. When satisfied that her treasures have been\r\n     discovered, she utters a peculiar, low, grating sound,\r\n     not unlike the purring of a cat. The male then comes to\r\n     the fore and braving the danger, is very courageous, and,\r\n     should the eggs be far advanced in incubation, he will even\r\n     enter the nest when you are almost within reach of it. When\r\n     the latter are rifled, he is always the first to go in and\r\n     discover the fact, often passing in and out several times\r\n     in a surprised sort of manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                CEOPHLOEUS PILEATUS PILEATUS (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\n                     SOUTHERN PILEATED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe above name is now restricted to the pileated woodpeckers of the\r\nLower Austral forests of the Southern United States, except southern\r\nFlorida, east of the Rocky Mountains. When Outram Bangs (1898) applied\r\nthe name _abieticola_, to the northern race, he said: “Linnaeus based\r\nhis _Picus pileatus_ on Catesby and Kalm. Taking Catesby as the best\r\nauthority, southern South Carolina must be considered the type locality\r\nof the species, and birds from this region are as extreme of the\r\nsouthern race as those from Florida.”\r\n\r\nThe southern pileated woodpecker is decidedly smaller than the northern\r\nbird and somewhat darker in coloration. Ridgway (1914) says of this\r\nrace, in a footnote: “Some of the more northern examples are quite\r\nas slaty as the extreme northern form (_P. p. abieticola_) but they\r\nare distinctly smaller. In other words, I have restricted the name\r\n_pileatus_ to an intermediate form, characterized by the small size of\r\n_P. p. floridanus_ combined with an appreciably lighter (more slaty or\r\nsooty) coloration, often approaching closely the lightness of hue of\r\n_P. p. abieticola_.”\r\n\r\nArthur T. Wayne (1910) says that in South Carolina “this fine species\r\nis abundant wherever the forest is of a primeval nature, but where\r\nthe heavy growth has been cut away it is seldom met with.” Wright\r\nand Harper (1913), writing of its haunts in southern Georgia, say:\r\n“With the exception of the red-bellied woodpecker, this is the most\r\nabundant member of its family in the Okefinokee. In fact, we saw as\r\nmany as four Pileated Woodpeckers in a single tree. In every part of\r\nthe swamp--especially the cypress bays, but also the hammocks and the\r\npiny woods on the islands, and even the ‘heads’ on the prairies--these\r\nmagnificent birds are at home.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Finlay Simmons (1925) says that in the Austin region of Texas\r\nthis woodpecker lives in the “wilder country only; cypress swamps, and\r\nthe most heavily timbered bottomlands, generally in very thinly settled\r\nsections; post oak woods on gravelly river terraces; edges of woodland\r\nmeadows; along margins of both large and small streams; Austroriparian\r\nforests; in or near edges of timber, venturing out onto fields to feed.”\r\n\r\nCharles R. Stockard (1904) says of his experience with this species in\r\nMississippi:\r\n\r\n     During three seasons seventeen nests were watched in Adams\r\n     County. In the vicinity where observations were made every\r\n     small woods had its pair of these large woodpeckers. The\r\n     individuals of this species seemed to occupy very small\r\n     feeding areas. Of the seven nests that were found in 1902\r\n     five pairs of the birds were located in their respective\r\n     woods during the previous December and January. Whenever\r\n     a pair was once seen feeding in a wood during the winter\r\n     the same pair could always be found very close to that\r\n     place. At the beginning of the nesting season they would\r\n     invariably make their burrow in some dead but sound tree\r\n     near the edge of the brake. From continued observation it\r\n     appeared certain that whenever a pair were found in a small\r\n     wood during the winter they were sure to nest there the\r\n     following spring. * * *\r\n\r\n     In four instances, all of which had lost their eggs the\r\n     year before, the birds built their new burrows in their\r\n     several woods within a distance of about one quarter of a\r\n     mile from the previous nest site. These four are the only\r\n     cases which were watched with special care.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The only nests of this race that I have seen were shown to\r\nme by A. T. Wayne, on May 19, 1915, near Mount Pleasant, S. C. They\r\nwere in tall, dead pine trees (_Pinus taeda_) in a heavily forested\r\nregion of open, mixed woods. One was 43 feet from the ground; he had\r\ntaken three fresh eggs from this nest on April 24, 1915. The other\r\nI estimated as over 60 feet up, but he said it was 80 feet from the\r\nground; it probably held young at that time, as both birds were much\r\nin evidence and very noisy. Mr. Wayne told me that these two pairs of\r\nbirds had nested in this tract of timber for many years. He writes\r\n(1910) regarding their nesting habits:\r\n\r\n     If the season is a forward one the birds mate early in\r\n     February and towards the latter part of the month begin\r\n     to excavate their hole, which requires exactly a month\r\n     for completion. During the month of March, 1904, I made\r\n     observations on a pair which excavated their hole in a\r\n     dead pine. On March 21, the opening was commenced by the\r\n     female, who drilled a small hole, and by degrees enlarged\r\n     it to the size of a silver dollar. The male assisted in the\r\n     excavation, but the female did by far the larger part of\r\n     the work. The size of the aperture was not increased until\r\n     necessary to admit the shoulders of the bird. I visited\r\n     these birds every day in order to note the progress of\r\n     their work, and, being so accustomed to seeing me, they\r\n     were utterly fearless and I could, at any time, approach\r\n     within twenty feet without hindering the work, although the\r\n     hole was only about thirty feet from the ground. This hole\r\n     was completed on April 21, and the first egg was laid the\r\n     following morning. * * * In this case the excavation was\r\n     made under a dead limb, and was about eighteen inches deep,\r\n     being hollowed out more on one side than the other. This\r\n     woodpecker is so attached to the tree in which it has first\r\n     made its nest that it continues to cling to it as long as\r\n     it can find a suitable spot at which to excavate a new\r\n     hole. It never uses the same hole a second time. I know of\r\n     a pair of these birds which resorted to the same tree for\r\n     four consecutive years, and each year they excavated a new\r\n     hole. * * *\r\n\r\n     If this bird is deprived of its first set of eggs, it at\r\n     once excavates a new hole, and the length of time consumed\r\n     in its construction is about twenty-five days. A curious\r\n     habit is that even when it is incubating or brooding\r\n     its young, this bird frequently taps in its hole as if\r\n     excavating.\r\n\r\nVernon Sharpe, Jr. (1932), says that in Tennessee “for a nesting site\r\na dead tree is invariably selected and preferably one of large size,\r\nfrom which the branches have fallen. The cavity is situated from 20 to\r\n85 feet above the ground, with a depth ranging from 20 to 26 inches.\r\nGenerally the four-inch opening is broader at the base and angular at\r\nthe top, forming somewhat of a triangular shape. While incubating, this\r\nspecies will continue to enlarge the nest cavity, as was proved by\r\npersonal experience.”\r\n\r\nM. G. Vaiden writes to me that the pileated woodpecker is fairly\r\ncommon in certain localities near Rosedale, Miss. He has located seven\r\nnests in cypress, sycamore, hackberry, or sweetgum trees, at estimated\r\nheights ranging from 60 to 75 feet. His nesting dates range from April\r\n14 to April 29.\r\n\r\nOf the nest location, in Texas, Mr. Simmons (1925) says: “Cavity in\r\nupper part, usually 30 to 60 feet from ground, in solid trunk of live,\r\nsound tree, less commonly in dead or partly dead limbs or trunks,\r\ngenerally tall cottonwood, cypress, elm, or oak, on the edge of woods\r\nor in marginal timber skirting stream, and usually easily located by\r\nthe half-bushel of big fresh chips scattered about on the ground below;\r\ntree 10 or more inches in diameter at cavity.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stockard (1904) says, of the 17 pairs that he watched in\r\nMississippi, that the birds do not lay a second set after the nest has\r\nbeen robbed, but they remain in the same woods during the remainder of\r\nthe season. He says of the nests:\r\n\r\n     The burrow is very large and requires in most cases about\r\n     one month for construction, being commenced in this\r\n     locality about the latter part of February. But it was very\r\n     difficult to note the exact length of time consumed in\r\n     burrowing, as the birds try so many parts of the same tree\r\n     before striking one to suit their taste. The nest tree and\r\n     other dead trees close at hand were often scarred from top\r\n     to bottom. In two cases they began a nest, then seemed to\r\n     start one in another place, and then returned to the former\r\n     and completed it. * * *\r\n\r\n     The first nest, a burrow twenty-five feet from the ground\r\n     in an old sycamore stump, contained one egg on March 22;\r\n     March 26 it contained three, and on April 1, when the set\r\n     was removed, it consisted of four slightly incubated eggs.\r\n     * * *\r\n\r\n     Only one pair was observed that had their nest in a dead\r\n     tree which stood in an open field at least sixty or seventy\r\n     yards from the wood. The female in this case flew about\r\n     the nest tree and lit once on the upper part and again\r\n     just over the nest hole while a person was in the act of\r\n     climbing the tree. This was by far the most daring bird\r\n     seen and, as mentioned above, because of the isolation of\r\n     the tree, her burrow was unusually exposed for this species.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The pileated woodpecker lays ordinarily from three to five\r\neggs; Audubon (1842) claims to have found six. The eggs vary from\r\novate, the commonest shape, to elliptical-ovate; some are even quite\r\npointed. They are a brilliant china-white and usually decidedly glossy.\r\nThe measurements of 52 eggs average 32.90 by 24.72 millimeters; the\r\neggs showing the four extremes measure =35.70= by =27.00=, =30.22= by\r\n22.35, and 29.30 by =22.00= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Bendire (1895) says that “an egg is deposited daily, and\r\nincubation begins occasionally before the set is completed, and lasts\r\nabout eighteen days, both sexes assisting in this duty, as well as\r\nin caring for the young. Like all Woodpeckers, the Pileated are very\r\ndevoted parents, and the young follow them for some weeks after leaving\r\nthe nest, until fully capable of caring for themselves. Only one brood\r\nis raised in a season.”\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--I have seen no small nestlings of this species, but they\r\nare probably hatched naked and blind, like all other woodpeckers; the\r\njuvenal plumage is evidently acquired before the young bird leaves the\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nThe young male, in juvenal plumage, is much like the adult male in\r\ngeneral appearance, but the body plumage is softer, less firm, and\r\nrather lighter and more sooty in color; the tips of the primaries have\r\ndull-white narrow margins, which soon wear away; the red of the head\r\nis duller, paler, and more restricted; on the fore half of the crown\r\nand the malar region, the feathers are basally grayish brown, the red\r\nshowing only on the tips of most of the feathers, producing a mixed\r\ncolor effect. The young female is similar to the young male but with\r\neven less red in the head; the forehead and most of the crown are\r\ngrayish brown, which invades the red posterior portion of the crown;\r\nand there is no red in the malar region. Audubon (1842) says that the\r\nbill of the young bird is considerably longer than that of the adult.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal plumage is apparently worn for only a short time, during\r\nthe summer and early fall; I have not been able to detect it beyond\r\nAugust; this is followed by a prolonged molt into a first winter\r\nplumage, which is scarcely distinguishable from that of the adult.\r\nAdults have a complete molt between June and September.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The food of the southern pileated woodpecker is not\r\nessentially different from that of the other races of the species, with\r\ndue allowance for the difference in environment. Prof. F. E. L. Beal\r\n(1895) says: “Six stomachs, collected by Dr. B. H. Warren on the St.\r\nJohns River in Florida, contained numerous palmetto ants (_Camponotus\r\nescuriens_), and remains of other ants, several larvae of a Prionid\r\nbeetle (_Orthosoma brunnea_), numerous builder ants (_Crematogaster\r\nlineolata_), one larva of _Xylotrechus_, and one pupa of the white ant\r\n(_Termes_).”\r\n\r\nGeorge Finlay Simmons (1925) says that in Texas it “feeds on ants,\r\nparticularly about decayed stumps; the eggs, larvae, and adults of\r\nwood-boring insects, particularly beetles; and on berries, acorns,\r\nnuts, and wild grapes. When digging for insects beneath the bark or in\r\nthe wood of dead limbs or trunks of trees, it pounds steadily away,\r\nhead swinging back in an impossible arc and driving straight down\r\nwith the force of a blacksmith’s sledge, chips flying every stroke or\r\ntwo; by employing a wrenching stroke with its chisel-bill, it knocks\r\nthree-inch, four-inch, or even six-inch chips from the tree and causes\r\nthem to fly for some distance.”\r\n\r\nArthur H. Howell (1924) says that in Alabama its food “consists mainly\r\nof ants, beetles, and wild fruits and berries, including sour gum,\r\ntupelo gum, dogwood, persimmon, frost grape, holly, poison ivy, sumac,\r\nand hackberry.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The pileated woodpecker is ordinarily a wild, shy bird of\r\nthe wilderness forests, though in some places it is said to be quite\r\nunsuspicious, where perhaps it has not yet learned to fear man, or\r\nwhere familiarity has taught it to trust him. Its flight is rather\r\nslow, but vigorous and usually direct, after the manner of a crow; at\r\ntimes, however, in short swings, it adopts the bounding flight, so\r\ncommon to many woodpeckers. It is an adept at keeping out of sight\r\nbehind a tree trunk and will lead a hunter a long chase by flying from\r\ntree to tree well in advance of him. When shot dead, it may cling for\r\nsome time to the branch or trunk, until its muscles relax and allow it\r\nto fall. If wounded, it keeps up a constant chatter while falling and\r\nwill not become quiet while life remains; a wounded bird should be\r\nhandled carefully, for it can inflict a painful wound with its powerful\r\nbeak.\r\n\r\nAudubon (1842) relates the following story, as told to him by the Rev.\r\nJohn Bachman: “A pair of pileated woodpeckers had a nest in an old elm\r\ntree, in a swamp, which they occupied that year; the next spring early,\r\ntwo blue-birds took possession of it, and there had young. Before these\r\nwere half grown, the woodpeckers returned to the place, and, despite of\r\nthe cries and reiterated attacks of the blue-birds, the others took the\r\nyoung, not very gently, as you may imagine, and carried them away to\r\nsome distance. Next the nest itself was disposed of, the hole cleaned\r\nand enlarged, and there they raised a brood. The nest, it is true, was\r\noriginally their own.”\r\n\r\nRobert P. Allen has sent me the following note: “When in one of the\r\nCarolina river swamps with Herbert L. Stoddard, early in December\r\n1936, we were interested in the actions of pileated woodpeckers that\r\nwe called to us by tapping on the side of our cypress dug-out in\r\nimitation of the birds. We paddled our canoe close against the buttress\r\nof a large cypress tree, so that we were partially concealed by the\r\ntrunk itself and by a dense growth of intertwining branches overhead.\r\nAs many as four pileateds at one time responded to our efforts, and\r\nall these appeared to be males. As they swooped low, to get a look at\r\nthis stranger in their midst, each bird made what we took to be an\r\n_intimidating_ noise with its wings.\r\n\r\n“From the immediate and pugnacious interest that these male (?)\r\npileateds showed in our presence, it would seem as if they had\r\npreviously cataloged the pileated population of that area and had,\r\ntherefore, rushed over to investigate the presence of a bird that could\r\nnot be accounted for, except as a stranger and a trespasser. Their\r\nefforts at intimidation were evidently designed to drive us out of the\r\nregion.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The most familiar note of the pileated woodpecker is the\r\nloud, ringing call, suggesting the “yucker” call of the flicker, but\r\nlouder and stronger, less rapid, more prolonged, and on a lower key.\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons (1925) has summed up the notes of this woodpecker very\r\nwell, as follows: “A loud _cac, cac, cac_ as it flies. A sonorous\r\n_cow-cow-cow_, repeated many times; a clear _wichew_, when two birds\r\nare together. A loud cackle, like loud, ringing, derisive laughter,\r\n_chuck-chuck_; _chuck, chuck-ah, chuck, chuck-ah, chuck, chuck, chuck,\r\nchuck_; or _chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck_.”\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The pileated woodpecker has the appearance of a large,\r\nblack bird, nearly as large as a crow and somewhat like it in flight,\r\nbut the large, white patches in the wings are distinctive, as well as\r\nthe flaming red crest. As it bounds through the woods in long swinging\r\nflights from tree to tree, it is unmistakable. While hammering on a\r\ntree trunk, its long neck and heavy head and beak are conspicuous and\r\ndistinctive.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Throughout most of its range the southern pileated\r\nwoodpecker is a permanent resident; in fact, there is very little\r\nsouthward movement for the species, even in the more northern portions\r\nof its range, except for winter wanderings in search of a suitable food\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nVernon Sharpe, Jr. (1932), writing from Tennessee, says: “The winter\r\nroosting place of this bird is rather interesting. A live hollow tree\r\nis selected, and there two or more holes are dug, presumably with\r\nthe thought of using one for escape should any attack by some night\r\nmarauder take place. These roosting places are used year after year;\r\nin fact, there is one site in the Overton Hills, south of Nashville,\r\nthat has been used for so many seasons it has become essential for the\r\nwoodpecker to cut away a portion of the tree that is trying to heal\r\nover the cavity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North America; chiefly timbered regions east of the Great\r\nPlains and from southern Mackenzie to western Montana and California.\r\n\r\nThe range of the pileated woodpecker extends =north= to northern\r\nBritish Columbia (Buckley Lake and Thutade Lake); southern Mackenzie\r\n(Fort Liard and Fort Smith); northern Saskatchewan (Poplar Point);\r\nnortheastern Ontario (Moose Factory); and southeastern Quebec (Godbout\r\nand Mont Louis Lake). =East= through the wooded areas along the\r\nAtlantic coast to southeastern Florida (Everglades, Royal Palm Hammock,\r\nand Key West). =South= along the Gulf coasts of Florida, Mississippi,\r\nand Louisiana, to southeastern Texas (San Point). The species is not\r\nknown through the southern Rocky Mountain and Great Basin regions,\r\nappearing next in central California (Yosemite Valley and Napa County).\r\nFrom the latter point it occurs north along the Pacific coast through\r\nOregon and Washington, to northwestern British Columbia (Hazelton and\r\nBuckley Lake).\r\n\r\nThe range above outlined is for the entire species, which has, however,\r\nbeen separated into four subspecies. The southern pileated woodpecker\r\n(_C. p. pileatus_) is found in the Eastern United States from central\r\nTexas and northern Florida north to Oklahoma, southern Illinois,\r\nsouthern Indiana, southern Pennsylvania, and Maryland; the northern\r\npileated woodpecker (_C. p. abieticola_), occupies the balance of the\r\nrange in Eastern North America, except for the peninsula of Florida\r\nto which the Florida pileated woodpecker (_C. p. floridanus_) is\r\nrestricted. The western pileated woodpecker (_C. p. picinus_) is found\r\nchiefly in the humid areas of the Northwest coast district but also\r\nsouth to central California and east to western Montana and Idaho.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--Two specimens have been taken in North Dakota,\r\none at Grafton on May 30, 1905, and the other at Fargo on October\r\n16, 1915. It may occur rarely in Wyoming, although no specimen is at\r\npresent known. The Colorado and New Mexico records are not considered\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--Alberta: 18 records, May 10 to June 22; 9 records,\r\n    May 15 to 30, indicating the height of the season.\r\n  Arkansas: 18 records, April 5 to May 15; 9 records, April 15 to 30.\r\n  Florida: 32 records, March 22 to May 25; 16 records, April 10 to 23.\r\n  New Hampshire: 6 records, May 6 to 25.\r\n  Pennsylvania: 7 records, April 23 to May 21.\r\n  Texas: 8 records, March 4 to May 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 CEOPHLOEUS PILEATUS ABIETICOLA Bangs\r\n\r\n                     NORTHERN PILEATED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                             PLATES 20-24\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\n                CONTRIBUTED BY BAYARD HENDERSON CHRISTY\r\n\r\nThis, the largest race of _Ceophloeus pileatus_, inhabits the forests\r\nof the Transition and Canadian Zones, from the Atlantic coast to the\r\nRocky Mountains. In the South it is replaced by _C. p. pileatus_ and\r\nin the West by _C. p. picinus_. The southern limit of its range lies\r\nacross southern Pennsylvania, West Virginia, central Ohio, southern\r\nIndiana, southern Illinois, and Missouri. The most northerly record\r\nof its occurrence is that of John Reid, noted by Bendire (1895). He\r\ntook a specimen on Big Island, in Great Slave Lake (lat. 61° N.).\r\nBangs (1898), who described the northern form and named it _C. p.\r\nabieticola_, believed that in the mountains of Virginia and West\r\nVirginia lay the line of transition from the southern to the northern\r\nform; but later investigators have determined that the line lies, as\r\nfirst noted above, somewhat northward of Bangs’ location.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics that distinguish the northern from the southern\r\nform are greater size, longer bill, slatiness rather than sootiness of\r\nthe black of the plumage, and greater extent of the white areas.\r\n\r\nCatesby (1731) depicted the bird (in its southern form) and called it\r\n“the large red-crested woodpecker”; and Linnaeus (1758), citing Catesby\r\nas his source, named it, for his purposes, _pileatus_ (= crested).\r\nFollowing Linnaeus, the English naturalist Latham (1783) began in 1781\r\nto publish his General Synopsis; and he, lacking knowledge of the bird\r\nin its haunts, and finding Catesby’s circumlocution unwieldy, took from\r\nLinnaeus’s Latin, as a name for common usage, “pileated woodpecker.”\r\nThe indications are that Latham coined the name; certainly he gave it\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nThe bird already possessed a common name; and it is a pity that Latham\r\ndid not know it. In its native land it was, and still is, commonly\r\ncalled, the log-cock. That is a good name--apt, picturesque, and widely\r\nused. Wilson (1811) knew it well enough, and so did Audubon (1842); and\r\nthey would have done well, had they given it place as the established\r\nvernacular name. But Wilson, under Bartram’s tutelage, followed Latham,\r\nand Audubon followed Wilson. They, in their prestige, have settled the\r\nmatter. Nuttall (1832) tried to make a stand for log-cock, and others\r\nsince have tried, but in vain. And now upon this splendid creature a\r\ndull piece of pedantry remains hopelessly fixed.\r\n\r\nAnother homespun name in extensive use is _Cock-of-the-woods_; yet\r\nanother is _Wood-cock_. This last is suitable enough, but it leads\r\nobviously to confusion. Accordingly, within the range of the true\r\nwoodcock (_Philohela minor_), the woodpecker is commonly distinguished\r\nas the “black woodcock.” Other appellatives that have been picked\r\nup here and there and gathered in the books are “black woodpecker,”\r\n“English woodpecker,” “black log,” “king-of-the-woods,” “stump\r\nbreaker”; and, because of its cackling cry, “wood-hen,” “Indian-hen,”\r\n“laughing woodpecker,” “johnny-cock,” “wood-chuck,” and “cluck-cock.”\r\n(The last, given by Scoville, 1920, as current in Juniata County, Pa.,\r\nis, perhaps, an assimilation from the Pennsylvania Dutch.)\r\n\r\nThe subspecific name _abieticola_ (= dweller amid fir trees) is in\r\nsome degree misleading, for, in the Northeastern States at least, the\r\nbird is commonly found in forests of mingled conifers and hardwoods;\r\nit shows no partiality to firs, nor even to conifers generally; and\r\nit cuts its nesting cavities, in the large majority of cases, in the\r\ndead and standing trunks of deciduous trees. In the Rocky Mountains,\r\nhowever, according to the Weydemeyers (1928), it prefers growths of\r\nlarch, yellow pine, and Douglas fir.\r\n\r\nIt is a denizen of extensive forests. It will adapt itself to second\r\ngrowth--particularly where the young trees have sprung up about some\r\nremnant of the old; but in any case it requires wide areas. As forests\r\ndwindle to woodlots, along with the wild turkey, the barred owl, and\r\nthe raven, it disappears. From regions once forested but now devoted\r\nto agriculture it is gone; in the mountains, however, in the marginal\r\nareas, where wooded ridges extend out to the plains, and in forested\r\nswamp lands, it continues. In such territories, indeed, its numbers\r\nduring the past 50 years have increased, and it has reappeared in\r\nlocalities once deserted. Reports of such recrudescence are many, and\r\nthey come from widely scattered places, particularly in the States to\r\neastward of the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nRoger T. Peterson (MS.) says: “The pileated woodpecker has greatly\r\nincreased in the Northeast during the past few years. At one time it\r\nwas nearly gone from many parts of New York State and southern New\r\nEngland, where it had occurred in fair numbers. The bird disappeared\r\nfrom northern New Jersey about 1880, and from southern New Jersey in\r\n1908. About 1920 W. DeWitt Miller found it again at two or three points\r\nin northern New Jersey; and now it is fairly common in many places in\r\nthe northern part of the State, and as far east as in Bergen County,\r\nwithin 15 miles of New York City. Within the past 5 years it has\r\nreappeared in the lower Hudson Valley. It is especially common in some\r\nportions of southwestern New York State. In one recent year I found\r\nfour nests near the city of Jamestown, N. Y. Similar increases have\r\nbeen noted by bird students in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Ohio, and\r\nMissouri”--and, he might have added, in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nLudlow Griscom (1929) wrote: “I incline to the view that the increase\r\nin this Woodpecker is not so much due to conservation, as to its\r\nadaptation to less primeval conditions. The generation that regarded\r\nthis species as a game-bird died off in this Region [the Northeastern\r\nStates] before it returned.”\r\n\r\nGranted that the species shows itself to be adaptable, it still is\r\npertinent to note other ameliorations of circumstance. When lumbering\r\noperations have been carried through to completion, when the camps are\r\ngone from the woods, and when new growth has begun to spring up, it is\r\ngenerally true that animal life in its larger forms tends to reappear\r\nand to increase. Again, the development of more fertile lands in the\r\nWest has had effect in the abandonment of poorer lands in the East.\r\nExtensive areas, in New England particularly, that a hundred years ago\r\nwere farmed, have now long since returned to wilderness. The forests of\r\nsecond growth, as they approach maturity, may be supposed increasingly\r\nto afford the food resources proper to this denizen of the great\r\nforests. And, finally, protective laws have been more intelligently\r\nframed, more widely adopted, and more generally respected.\r\n\r\nThe birds range over plain and mountain side. They prefer “the edges\r\nof the balsam and cedar swamps, when surrounded with forests of\r\nhardwood and hemlocks” (Blackwelder, 1909, Iron County, Mich.). Their\r\nnesting places are ordinarily in lowlands, and near water. In the\r\nregion where I have known them best--the Huron Mountains, in Marquette\r\nCounty, Mich.--I have found the birds to occur in pairs or families at\r\nintervals of two or three miles along the course of a river that flows\r\nthrough primeval forest land. This I take to be a fair indication of\r\nthe saturation point in pileated woodpecker population.\r\n\r\n_Migration._--Generally speaking, the species is resident wherever\r\nfound. Some of the earlier naturalists supposed that it retired in\r\nwinter from the more northerly portions of its range; but none affords\r\nany evidence. George Miksch Sutton (1930), when ornithologist for the\r\nGame Commission of Pennsylvania, having reviewed the reports of the\r\nwardens, said that they tended to indicate a gradual movement of the\r\nbirds in winter around the eastern end of Lake Erie and southward into\r\nPennsylvania. Such may be the case. On the other hand, it is true that,\r\nafter the nesting season has passed, and throughout fall and winter,\r\nthe birds wander and appear in areas where at other seasons they are\r\nunknown; and it may be that Dr. Sutton’s wardens were basing their\r\nreports upon such seasonal reappearances. More precise observations\r\nmust be made before it can be asserted with confidence that there is\r\nmigration in any sense other than that here recognized.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--It is usual to find the birds associated in pairs, even\r\nafter the nesting season has passed; and from this the inference has\r\nbeen drawn (Morrell, 1901; Knight, 1908) that they continue, year\r\nafter year, constantly mated. Lewis O. Shelley, writing from East\r\nWestmoreland, N. H., says (MS.): “It is my belief that the pileated\r\nmates for life, for, seen almost daily, one pair is known to have\r\nshown no active spring display for the past few years, nor was a third\r\nbird (male) seen near.” This inference may be sound; nevertheless, an\r\nelement of conjecture here should not be overlooked, and further data\r\nshould be sought.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, certainly, the birds engage in mating antics, and Edmund\r\nW. Arthur (1934) relates an example:\r\n\r\n     On April 14, 1933, while driving with a companion * * *\r\n     from Slippery Rock [Pennsylvania] * * * to Grove City, I\r\n     observed a Pileated Woodpecker * * * flying across the\r\n     highway a short distance south of Barmore Run. Stopping our\r\n     car, we got out and followed the bird with our eyes, until\r\n     it alighted on a tall tree a thousand feet away in the\r\n     swampy woodland. Presently another, and then a third, were\r\n     seen. They were quite restless, though apparently fearless,\r\n     as evidenced by their flying about, alighting in plain view\r\n     of us upon trees not fifty yards distant. After several\r\n     minutes one of them--a female we thought--alighted upon a\r\n     grassy knoll in a pasture to the left of the road, where\r\n     it walked about for a brief interval, until a second came\r\n     to the knoll and approached within three or four feet of\r\n     the first. Then began a curious movement, much resembling\r\n     the dance of Flickers, wherein with bowing and scraping one\r\n     bird, stepping sideways, made a circle about the other, who\r\n     slowly turned, facing the performer. When the dance ceased\r\n     there was a sudden jerky movement on the part of each,\r\n     and thereupon they flew away. There are two houses at the\r\n     intersection, and the people living in one of them told us\r\n     that a pair of these birds had nested the year before in a\r\n     maple just in the rear of their house.\r\n\r\nFrancis H. Allen has written a description of a formal dance at a\r\nseason remote from mating time; and, since the description has not\r\nbeen published, and since it is pertinent to the question of permanence\r\nof mating, it is here given at length:\r\n\r\n“On the side of Mount Monadnock, N. H., October 13, 1908, I watched two\r\nbirds executing a sort of dance. When first seen they were clinging\r\nto the hole of a spruce, near the ground. They hopped up and down the\r\ntrunk, frequently pecking at each other’s bills simultaneously, now on\r\none side of the tree, now on the other. When I got too near they flew a\r\nshort distance to another tree, and I followed them about from tree to\r\ntree for about half an hour, often within 50 or 60 feet of them. They\r\nalways lit at the base of the tree and worked up a few feet, seldom\r\ngoing more than 5 feet up, I think. They hopped backward and downward a\r\ngreat deal, and often they lifted and partly spread their wings. Their\r\nmotions were limber and undulating, marked by a certain awkward grace,\r\nwithout the stiffness of the smaller woodpeckers. The crests were\r\nelevated occasionally. I noticed no difference in the markings, but I\r\nwas then unacquainted with the sexual differences of the species, and I\r\ncannot say whether or not they were male and female. They occasionally\r\nuttered a faint _wahh, wahk, wahk_, in a soft, conversational tone; but\r\nit was for the most part a silent performance.”\r\n\r\nThe bird drums a roll, as do other woodpeckers. The only other drumming\r\nof comparable intensity is that of the yellow-bellied sapsucker, but\r\ncommonly the pileated woodpecker’s performance is so heavy as to be\r\nunmistakable. Often the drumming consists not of a roll but of slow\r\nheavy beats. Dr. Sutton (1930) writes: “On May 19, 1925, * * * I\r\nheard a male drumming for over an hour * * * During the whole period\r\nthere was a noticeable similarity of the performances * * * At least\r\nfifty or sixty times there was an introductory, rapidly given _roll_;\r\nthen a pause, followed by three distinct blows, * * * giving much the\r\nimpression of a queer rhythm beat upon an aboriginal drum.” With this\r\nthe description of the drumming of the sapsucker given by Dr. Harry C.\r\nOberholser (1896b) may be compared.\r\n\r\nErnest Waters Vickers (1915) gives the following description of “the\r\nmasterly roll of the great log-cock”:\r\n\r\n     “This roll is composed of twelve strokes or blows, forming\r\n     an ascending and descending climax; increasing in rapidity\r\n     and volume to the middle and dying in force and rapidity\r\n     just as it began. While the bird may not give the complete\r\n     roll, may break off anywhere, it is always, so far as I\r\n     have heard, a part of the above * * * A mellow yet powerful\r\n     cellular jar to which the whole wooded heart of the forest\r\n     makes echoing response--a solemn and ancient sound. * * *\r\n\r\n     “Thus * * * I heard one drumming far away on a sounding\r\n     board of peculiar musical resonance and power to carry * * *\r\n     I had often heard this roll a full mile and a half away;\r\n     once or twice I had even heard it in the house with doors\r\n     and windows closed! * * * This old sounding-board was the\r\n     hollow limb or arm of a big tulip tree or “white wood”\r\n     flung out at right angle from the trunk 60 or 70 feet from\r\n     the ground, a mere shell as appeared * * * sound and hard\r\n     and barkless. The spot where he hammered was white where\r\n     the weathered gray fibers had been beaten off by constant\r\n     use.\r\n\r\n     “That April day * * * he sat upright upon the limb grasping\r\n     it firmly, * * * poising himself, making a motion or two\r\n     as a neat penman about to begin writing starts with a\r\n     preliminary flourish, struck the limb somewhat lightly\r\n     at first and deliberately, accelerating both speed and\r\n     power, diminishing to stop as he started. He then paused\r\n     to listen to the effect, attend to the echoes, or wait for\r\n     the response of his mate perhaps, which occasionally rolled\r\n     back from somewhere away east in the woods. He would hop\r\n     about a trifle, cock his head examining his neighborhood a\r\n     little, dress his feathers or search for parasites;--but\r\n     not for long did he forget what he was there for; then\r\n     gather himself up for another reverberation. With such\r\n     energy did he hammer that his whole body shook and his\r\n     wings quivered. He fairly hurled himself wildly at it.\r\n     The great loose hair-like scarlet crest flowed in the sun\r\n     and his scarlet moustache added to his noble and savage\r\n     appearance.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The birds are very tenacious of their nesting places,\r\nreturning year after year to the same location and even to the same\r\ntree trunk. It is usual to find several nesting holes (and, perhaps,\r\nwinter quarters too) within an area, say, 100 yards square. In such\r\npreference, held to even when the forest has been partially cut down,\r\nthe reason probably lies why nests sometimes are found in open places.\r\nCommonly, however, the nesting stub stands in heavy forest and within\r\nthe shadow of the leafy canopy. There are a few records of nests on\r\nmountain sides and ridges, but, typically, the nesting tree stands in\r\nvalley or bottomland and near the margin of lake or stream or in a\r\nswamp. The boles of trees riddled and furrowed in the pursuit of food\r\nare in no case used for nesting. An ant-infested trunk may be supposed\r\nto be definitely not suitable for such use.\r\n\r\nData are at hand upon 33 nests, from points widely scattered throughout\r\nthe range. Of these, one cavity was sunk in a large dead hemlock, one\r\nin a dead pitch pine, one in a telegraph pole (an oddity--Roberts,\r\n1932), and 30 in the boles of deciduous trees. Three are reported as\r\ndug in living trees; four are more particularly reported as in the\r\ndead tops of living trees; the remaining 20-odd were, certainly most\r\nof them, and (for all that appears) all of them, in dead stubs. Of the\r\n30, eight were in beech trees; six in poplar, and a seventh in tulip\r\npoplar. Three were in birches, three in oaks, three in hickories. Two\r\nwere in sugar maples and one in a red maple. One was in an ash, one\r\nin an elm, and one in a basswood. One was as low as 15 feet from the\r\nground; three as high as 70 feet. The average height was about 45 feet.\r\n\r\nThe trunk at the point where the hole is drilled will ordinarily be\r\nfrom 15 to 20 inches in diameter. The hole commonly, though not\r\ninvariably, faces the east or the south. Such is the preferred\r\nposition, but, as may be supposed, the slope of the surface of the tree\r\ntrunk and the quality of the wood are factors in the choice; and holes\r\nsometimes are found drilled in west and north faces of the trunks.\r\nThe hole may be drilled through bark; more frequently it is through\r\nthe bleached and bonelike surface of a stub from which the bark has\r\nlong been stripped away. Though sometimes quite circular, the hole\r\ntends to be of triangular outline, peaked above and leveled below. The\r\nlower margin of the hole is outwardly and downwardly beveled and very\r\nnicely finished. The orifice varies from 3¼ to 4½ inches in diameter,\r\nand typically may be 3¼ inches in width and 3½ in vertical extent. The\r\nonly other notable item in external appearance is that, if the tree\r\nbe bare of bark and smooth surfaced (as is usual), an area of surface\r\na few inches below the hole will be seen to have become polished by\r\nthe rubbing of the tail feathers of the parent birds. And this spot,\r\nperhaps in consequence of difference in the absorption of moisture and\r\nfungus growth, may persist and be still plainly discernible in later\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nA nesting tree that may be regarded as typical stood in a dense forest,\r\nentirely of hardwood--maples, elms, and yellow birches--on the plain of\r\na high and ancient beach of Lake Superior, cut through by a mountain\r\nstream, and about a hundred yards from the water. It was the smooth\r\nand barkless stub of a dead elm, about 45 feet high and having a\r\ngirth, breast-high, of 76 inches. The hole was smooth and white, and\r\nthe wood was still firm. The stub stood well shaded beneath the living\r\ntrees. A few flecks of morning sunlight fell upon its eastern face;\r\nbut throughout the greater part of the day it remained in shadow. It\r\nhad been the woodpeckers’ nesting place certainly for four years. The\r\nhighest hole seemed to be the oldest--in the south face and near the\r\ntop. The uppermost 6 feet of the stub had since become weathered and\r\nchecked and manifestly unsuitable. Next, on the north face, there was\r\nan old and black-looking hole about 36 feet up. The third and lowest\r\nhole was in the east face and about 25 feet up; and, lastly, there was\r\nthe hole of the year, 34 feet up and also in the east face.\r\n\r\nThe chamber within is capacious and is ordinarily of conical form,\r\ntapering slightly from a low domed roof downward to a bowllike bottom.\r\nThere may be a slight bulging of the walls below a narrowed median\r\nportion. The depth may vary from 10 to 24 inches (extreme figures\r\nof 6 and 26 have been recorded). The average of 15 measurements is\r\n19 inches. The entrance hole leads to the upper widest portion, and\r\nthere the chamber is 7 or 8 inches across. The distance from the outer\r\nsurface of the hole of the tree to the remote wall of the chamber is\r\nabout 11 inches. The entrance passageway about 2 inches inward is\r\nridged across, and from this median ridge the floor of the passageway\r\nslopes downward, both inwardly and outwardly, and this outward slope\r\nforms the bevel already mentioned. The bowl at the bottom is 6 or 6½\r\ninches across. In a specimen before me as I write, the wall of the\r\nchamber below the entrance hole is 4 inches thick. The ridge across the\r\nfloor of the entrance passageway is rounded. Its crest is 2¼ inches\r\ninward from the outer surface of the tree trunk, and the vertical\r\ndepth of the outward bevel is 2 inches. All the surfaces of the cavity\r\nare neatly and uniformly chiseled. Along the sides of the entrance\r\npassageway extend in parallel curves the tool marks of the bird’s beak.\r\nNo nesting materials are brought in. A feather or two will be the only\r\ntrace of occupancy remaining after the young are flown. In some though\r\nnot in all cases it is possible for a man to thrust in his arm and\r\nreach the bottom of the chamber.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, certainly, a new cavity is drilled for every\r\nbrood. Such exceptions as have been recorded have explanation in\r\nhuman interference. Samuel Scoville, Jr. (1920), quotes Richard C.\r\nHarlow to the effect that but once in his experience had a second\r\nuse of a nesting cavity occurred. Afterward Mr. Harlow said to me in\r\nconversation that even in that instance the cavity had been deepened\r\nbefore it was used for a second time. The only other instance that\r\nhas come to my attention is one recorded by Morrell (1901) in which a\r\nsingle cavity was used three times--in 1895, in 1897, and in 1898. In\r\npreparation for the third nesting the cavity had been deepened by three\r\ninches. This nesting was in “a small patch of good sized trees * * *\r\nseparated [from] the main growth by cutting,” and it may be supposed\r\nthat the woodpeckers had been unduly limited in the choice of nesting\r\nsites. In both cases the birds were subject to the disturbance of\r\npersistent egg-collecting. It stands to reason that, in avoidance of\r\nparasites, the practice should have evolved of drilling a fresh cavity\r\nfor each brood.\r\n\r\nMr. Harlow (1914) found that in one instance the drilling of the\r\nnesting cavity was in progress in March and was continued “all during\r\nMarch and April.” The female worked alone, and the male continued near\r\nby. This nest, an unusually early one, contained, on April 30, three\r\neggs. In the Northern States the eggs commonly are laid early in May.\r\nIncubation continues, according to Burns (1915), for 18 days. The young\r\nleave the nest about the middle of June.\r\n\r\nThe range of date in nesting is illustrated by two records that come\r\nfrom Centre County, Pa. (Scoville, 1920; Burleigh, 1931). One is\r\nof a set of eggs that hatched on May 11. These eggs must have been\r\nlaid before April 23. The other record is of a set collected May 11\r\nand found to be practically fresh. The interval at which these two\r\ncases stand apart is about 25 days. Scoville (1920) quotes Harlow, a\r\ncollector whose experience was chiefly in Centre County, to the effect\r\nthat “May 10 is the standard date for a full clutch of eggs.”\r\n\r\nRecords of nests are at hand from Maine, New Hampshire, New York,\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin. The total body of data, however, is\r\nsmall; and it is not possible to discover what the difference may be in\r\nmean nesting date from south to north within the region covered. There\r\nis a record from Maine, for instance (Morrell, 1901), of a set of eggs\r\nfound to be heavily incubated as early as May 13.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The eggs are white, with a gleaming smoothness and\r\ntranslucence of shell. They rest at the bottom of the cavity, on the\r\nbare bed of finely splintered wood. Three eggs often complete the set,\r\nbut more commonly four. Of 17 recorded sets, 4 are sets of three,\r\nand 13 are sets of four. Some of the earlier writers (Wilson, for\r\ninstance, 1811) said the number of eggs might be five or even six; but\r\nno specific record of so large a number has been found. The eggs are of\r\novate outline.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of 51 eggs average 33.16 by 25.21 millimeters; the\r\neggs showing the four extremes measure =38.2= by =27.1=, =30.2= by\r\n25.2, and 33.05 by =23.75= millimeters.\r\n\r\nThere are cases on record in which a pair of these birds, robbed\r\nof their eggs, have laid again (and in the same cavity); with this\r\nqualification, there is but a single brood in a season.\r\n\r\n_Young._--In a particular instance; which I take to be typical, of a\r\nnesting (in northern Fulton County, Pa.) I found the male to be no less\r\nattentive than the female to the duties of incubation and nurture. In\r\none respect, indeed, the male seemed to be the more attentive, for\r\non both of the two occasions when I had opportunity to observe--once\r\nshortly before, the other shortly after the hatching of the eggs--it\r\nwas the male bird who at sunset retired within the hole and who at\r\nsunrise the following morning appeared from within. And I mention this\r\nthe more confidently since I find chance confirmation in the narrative\r\nof another observer, Morrell (1901), and since like observations have\r\nbeen made upon other species of woodpeckers--upon the flicker, for\r\ninstance, and upon the ivory-billed woodpecker (Allen, 1937).\r\n\r\nWhen incubation was in progress I found the parent birds to be\r\nrelieving one another at intervals of about two hours; and a week\r\nlater, when the young were still small, they were coming in with food\r\nand replacing one another at intervals of approximately one hour. It\r\nmay have been accidental, and yet it seemed to me noteworthy, that the\r\nroutine of hourly visits was broken when the female returned after an\r\nabsence of 10 minutes to afford the male freedom for 40 minutes before\r\nhe returned to retire within the cavity for the night.\r\n\r\nAt the time when hatching was near, and afterward when the young were\r\nnewly hatched, one or the other of the parent birds was constantly\r\npresent in the nesting chamber and, the weather being warm, was much\r\nof the time perched immediately within the hole. And I then realized\r\nthe value of the larger dimensions of the upper portion of the chamber.\r\nThe waiting bird was constantly moving about, thrusting its head out\r\nand withdrawing it again, turning about within the chamber so that it\r\nhad free view outward, preening, reaching upward with its foot and\r\nscratching its head. And all this movement was free because the space\r\nwas wide.\r\n\r\nEach of the parents seemed to have its own path of approach to the\r\nnest. One of them came almost invariably to a particular position on\r\nthe trunk, about 6 feet below and to the right, and hopped up thence to\r\nthe entrance, but the other bird followed a different course.\r\n\r\nI was impressed, too, with the comparative silence of the birds\r\nat their nesting tree. Such small converse as took place there (a\r\nflicker-like _wuck-a-wuck_--and it occurred irregularly) was so soft as\r\nto be scarcely audible to human ears at a distance of fifty yards.\r\n\r\nThe feeding of the young is by regurgitation; and, while the young are\r\nstill small and remain at the bottom of the nesting cavity, the parents\r\nmay be seen to follow an interesting routine. The incoming bird hops\r\nto the hole, perches on the ridge of the entrance passageway, and then\r\nswings inward and downward, at the same time elevating the posterior\r\npart of its body until the tail presses upon the outer upper rim of the\r\nhole. In this position, evidently, the parent’s bill meets those of the\r\nnestlings. This attitude is maintained often for as much as a minute,\r\nand while it is maintained the body of the bird may be seen to shake\r\nconvulsively--plainly indicating that regurgitation is in progress.\r\n\r\nWhen the young are small, the parent, after feeding, does not\r\nimmediately leave the nest but awaits the incoming of its mate. It\r\nthen glides away on wide-spread wings; and, while I suspected that the\r\nexcrement of the young is carried in the bill and dropped, I was unable\r\nto detect this. Quite possibly, in this early stage at least, the\r\nexcrement is swallowed by the parent.\r\n\r\nCharles W. Townsend (1925) gave account of a family observed in\r\nWorcester County, Mass., when the young were well developed and nearly\r\nready to leave the nest:\r\n\r\n     On June 11, 1924, I spent five hours within twenty-five\r\n     feet of the base of the stub, unconcealed, and on June 14,\r\n     six hours, but after the first hour I took up a position\r\n     about fifty yards away, partially concealed by bushes.\r\n\r\n     My observations may be summarized as follows: the young\r\n     were fed eleven times at the first visit, four times at the\r\n     second when the adults acted in a very shy manner. As a\r\n     rule the female fed the young, but on three occasions the\r\n     male was identified at the hole. * * *\r\n\r\n     As a rule the adult appeared suddenly at the hole, flying\r\n     noiselessly through the forest. Occasionally it alighted\r\n     below the hole and rapidly ascended by hops, or it alighted\r\n     on some neighboring tree, and often calling like a Flicker,\r\n     glided on motionless outstretched wings in a graceful curve\r\n     to its young. The flight away from the hole was always\r\n     direct after a preliminary downward glide and lacked the\r\n     usual woodpecker undulations. * * *\r\n\r\n     The three young crowded to the hole as soon as a parent\r\n     appeared anywhere in the neighborhood and eagerly stretched\r\n     forth their heads and necks. * * * They were always hungry\r\n     and screamed with rasping voices for food, once or twice\r\n     they uttered low whinnies. The adult inserted its bill\r\n     to its full length into the throats of the young and\r\n     vigorously regurgitated and pumped in the nourishment. * * *\r\n     After feeding the young, the female on several occasions,\r\n     the male on one, entered the nest, to emerge after a minute\r\n     or two and glide away. Once I detected a white piece in the\r\n     bill, once, something dark, but the other times nothing at\r\n     all.\r\n\r\nHerbert L. Stoddard (1917) has noted the “hissing” noise of the young\r\nwithin the nesting cavity when the trunk is jarred, “similar to young\r\nflickers, but a great deal louder.”\r\n\r\nWhen the young have flown from the nest, the cavity is not utterly\r\nabandoned. I once saw one of the parent birds reenter at midday a\r\ncavity from which the young had recently flown and remain within for\r\n40 minutes. Why, I know not. The mate accompanied this returning bird\r\nand waited near by. Maurice Brooks writes (MS.): “Nest cavities are\r\nsometimes used as roosting places after the nesting season. On the\r\nevening of August 2, 1937, at Jacksons Mill [Lewis County, W. Va.], I\r\nsaw six birds (two adults and four young) enter a cavity that had held\r\na nest earlier in the season. This was probably the brood of the year,\r\nwith the parents.”\r\n\r\n_Food._--The pileated woodpecker lives upon insects that infest\r\nstanding and fallen timber and supplements this diet with wild berries\r\nand acorns.\r\n\r\nAnts are the chief item of food. It is in pursuit of ants that the\r\nwoodpecker cuts its great furrows in the boles of standing trees,\r\nliving and dead. On examination the heart wood exposed by the\r\nwoodpecker’s operations will be found to have been penetrated by the\r\nlabyrinthine passageways of the great carpenter ants, _Camponotus\r\nherculeanus_ (Linnaeus).\r\n\r\nAll the observations of others that have come to my attention\r\nupon the woodpecker when actually engaged in cutting these great\r\ntrunk-penetrating chasms have been made in winter and early in spring,\r\nand with them my own are in agreement. It is a natural surmise that\r\nonly in winter is such heavy work done, since in summer proper food is\r\nmore easily available. Another surmise along the same lines is that\r\nthe disappearance of the bird from particular areas, followed after\r\nan interval of years by reappearance, may perhaps have occurred in\r\ncorrespondence with precisely such a fluctuation in its essential,\r\nwintertime food supply: it must find, when the ground is snow-covered,\r\nant-infested trunks of large trees.\r\n\r\nIn September I once made leisurely observation upon a bird at work upon\r\na dead but standing hemlock tree. With swinging, obliquely directed\r\nblows it was splitting off the outer leaves of the scalelike bark and\r\npausing intermittently with head turned to the trunk, licking up, as\r\nI supposed, the insect life thus exposed. Again, in September, I came\r\nupon a pair feeding together upon the ground. They had been tearing up\r\na carpet of moss that spread over damp surfaces both of wood and of\r\nrock, and I thought that their prey must be insect life that they were\r\nfinding in the moss itself.\r\n\r\nAnd yet again, on September 21, I watched for many minutes an adult\r\nfemale feeding on a charred and decayed stump that remained in a young\r\nforest of jack pines. She was perched about a foot from the ground. Her\r\nmethod was by deliberate and swinging blows to break away platelike\r\nfragments of still firm wood, and then to intrude her bill and search\r\nwith her tongue (as was evident) the opened cavity. This licking was\r\nalways, or nearly always, upward, and often the head was turned, crown\r\ninward, throat outward. A jay might call or some other forest sound\r\nbe heard, and the bird would pause, listen for an instant, and then\r\nresume her work. A day or two later I visited the stump and with my\r\nknife made an incision in it, and I found it to be the home of a colony\r\nof ants--not of the large _Camponotus_ but of a smaller, wine-black\r\nspecies about a quarter of an inch long. The body of the stump was\r\nhoneycombed with their galleries.\r\n\r\nOf the major wintertime operations Vickers (1910) has written:\r\n\r\n     Like the flicker, the [pileated woodpecker] is a great\r\n     lover of ants, which accordingly occupy a large place in\r\n     his bill-of-fare. So, to dine on the big black timber ants,\r\n     which are his special delight, he drives holes to the very\r\n     heart of growing forest trees, tapping the central chamber\r\n     of the colony, where, in winter, he finds the dormant\r\n     swarm unable to move and feasts upon them at leisure....\r\n     And the Log-cock makes no mistakes, though man might find\r\n     no outward sign of an ant-tree. Doubtless that strong\r\n     formic smell, coupled with his experience in sounding tree\r\n     trunks,--as a man tells a ripe watermelon by the _plunk_ of\r\n     it,--enables him not only to find the tree, but, what is\r\n     more remarkable, to drive his hole with such precision that\r\n     he taps the heart of the community.\r\n\r\nO. M. Bryens (1926) wrote from St. Joseph County, Mich.:\r\n\r\n     On February 16, 1925, I was able to approach within twelve\r\n     feet of one of these Woodpeckers busily engaged in digging\r\n     in a maple stub, two feet in diameter and about twelve feet\r\n     high. He was after insects whose borings I found later upon\r\n     examining the wood. I watched him for about an hour.\r\n\r\n     He seldom gave more than three or four pecks at a time, and\r\n     would then swing his head round to one side or the other,\r\n     sometimes raising his scarlet crest. He seldom threw back\r\n     his head without tossing a chip back of him, and when I\r\n     examined his work after he had left, later in the day, I\r\n     found some chips near the stub, which were three inches\r\n     long and one inch wide. Others half this size had been\r\n     thrown out on the snow a distance of four feet. The hole\r\n     was on the west side and measured six inches across and ten\r\n     inches long, and extended to a depth of six inches toward\r\n     the heart of the stub. There was another hole six inches\r\n     square on the south side. The bird seemed to chisel out a\r\n     section three inches wide across the hole and then move\r\n     down and cut out another section. The two holes were dug in\r\n     about two hours.\r\n\r\nOf summertime feeding Ora W. Knight (1908) says: “Except the Flicker\r\nthis is the only species of Woodpecker I have observed feeding on the\r\nground, but this species likes to tear open the ant hills found in open\r\nplaces in the woods and feed on the ants and their larvæ.” He also says\r\nthat in the fall these birds eat “dogwood berries, choke and black\r\ncherries and other wild fruits and berries, also beechnuts and acorns\r\nfor which it has a decided fondness.”\r\n\r\nDr. Sutton (1930) says:\r\n\r\n     The food of this species in Pennsylvania, according to\r\n     official examination of four stomachs, is largely of\r\n     ants. The stomach and crop of a male specimen weighing\r\n     nine ounces, collected at Northumberland, Northumberland\r\n     County, on November 10, 1928, contained 469 carpenter\r\n     ants (_Camponotus herculaneus_), most of them so recently\r\n     swallowed as to permit of counting them easily. The stomach\r\n     of a female taken at Aitch, Huntingdon County, on November\r\n     30, 1928, contained the remains of at least 153 carpenter\r\n     ants, one small carabid beetle, the legs of a small bug\r\n     (apparently a squash-bug), and 17 wild grapes, swallowed\r\n     whole.\r\n\r\nF. E. L. Beal (1911) gave the results of examination of the contents of\r\n80 stomachs collected far and wide throughout the range of the species.\r\nAnimal food amounted to 72.88 percent; vegetable, 27.12 percent.\r\nBeetles made up 22.01 percent of the total, and ants 39.91 percent.\r\nAs many as 2,600 ants were counted in a single stomach. The ants were\r\n“mostly of the larger species that live in decaying timber.” Ants and\r\nbeetles together made up the bulk of the animal food (61.92 percent).\r\n\r\nThe Biological Survey (A. L. Nelson) has kindly made reply to my\r\ninquiry concerning stomach examinations of the subspecies _abieticola_\r\nalone. Data were available from 23 specimens, three collected in\r\nJanuary, two in June, two in July, six in October, eight in November,\r\nand two in December. They were collected, two in Canada, two in New\r\nBrunswick, four in New York, four in Pennsylvania, six in Michigan, two\r\nin Illinois, two in Minnesota, and one in Iowa.\r\n\r\nAnimal food amounted to 83 percent of the whole; vegetable, 17 percent,\r\nwith but a trace of gravel (one stomach only). The chief item was ants,\r\nprincipally large black ants, such as _Camponotus_ and _Crematogaster_;\r\nthis item alone constituted 60 percent of the whole. The animal\r\nfood otherwise consisted of a variety of beetles and of a very few\r\n(2 percent) caterpillars. The vegetable food was made up of wild\r\nberries (_Ilex_, _Cassine_, _Vitis cordifolia_, _Nyssa sylvatica_, and\r\n_Viburnum nudum_--in all, 11 percent of the whole), mast (2 percent),\r\nand rotten wood (4 percent).\r\n\r\nCatesby’s (1731) assertion, repeated time and again by the earlier\r\nwriters, that the pileated woodpecker sometimes pierces the husks of\r\nmaize standing in the field, was almost certainly based on faulty\r\nobservation. No modern confirmation is to be found of this or of any\r\nother predatory practice. To the contrary, the finding after careful\r\ninvestigation (Beal, 1911) is: “The food of the pileated woodpecker\r\ndoes not interest the farmer or horticulturist, for it is obtained\r\nentirely from the forest or the wild copses on its edge. This bird does\r\nnot visit either the orchard or the grain field, and all its work in\r\nthe forest helps to conserve the timber * * *. Its killing should be\r\nstrictly prohibited at all times.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The bird is but little known--surprisingly little,\r\nconsidering how large a bird it is. It is a forest dweller; it lives\r\nalmost wholly within the canopy of the treetops; it is alert, furtive\r\n(almost) as a bear, rather silent in midsummer (the season when city\r\ndwellers ordinarily visit the northern forests); and it easily eludes\r\nobservation. It is not strange then that, its gigantic operations\r\nremaining in evidence, the bird itself should in common thought have\r\nbecome a somewhat fabulous creature. Thoreau (1906) never saw it; and\r\nthis is what he wrote of it in the Moosehead Lake journal under date\r\nof July 25, 1857: “Our path up the bank here led by a large dead white\r\npine, in whose trunk near the ground were great square-cornered holes\r\nmade by the woodpeckers. * * * They were seven or eight inches long\r\nby four wide and reached to the heart of the tree through an inch or\r\nmore of sound wood, and looked like great mortise-holes whose corners\r\nhad been somewhat worn and rounded by a loose tenon. The tree for some\r\ndistance was quite honeycombed by them. It suggested woodpeckers on a\r\nlarger scale than ours, as were the trees and the forest.”\r\n\r\nTo one who visits its haunts the presence of the pileated woodpecker\r\nis immediately made manifest by operations such in magnitude as to\r\nhave astonished Thoreau. Dead Norway pines may be found, gaunt and\r\nbare, their bark split away in plates and lying heaped at the base,\r\nand living white pines--young trees, particularly--pierced to the core\r\nwith deep pyramidal incisions. The freshly cut wood gleams clean, and\r\nturpentine in pellucid globules rims the cut and drips downward. Great\r\nboles of maples and basswoods stand, furrowed from broken top to base,\r\nthe ground below littered with splinters, often half a hand’s breadth\r\nin extent. The cuts are roughly rectangular in outline. They may be\r\n4, 5, or even 6 or 8 inches wide and are sunk deep into the heart of\r\nthe tree. They may extend vertically for a few inches or for a foot or\r\nmore. They may be aligned in vertical rows, and may run together in\r\nfurrows of several feet in length. Crumbling stumps and moss-covered\r\nlogs lying on the forest floor will often be found ripped and torn by\r\nthe woodpecker’s beak.\r\n\r\nIt is, as has been said, a wary creature, and is not easily stalked.\r\nOn one occasion, when I had successfully approached a male that was\r\nidling in the top of a gaunt chestnut near the nesting tree, I paused,\r\nbefore shifting from an uncomfortable position, until the bird should\r\nsidle around the limb. Even so, he was quicker than I; for, before I\r\nhad completed my movement, he was peering from the opposite side, and,\r\ndetecting me, was off. Again I came upon a bird--a male--suddenly, in\r\nopen forest. He did not immediately take wing, but, hitching downward\r\nupon the tree trunk, he reached the ground, hopped off, and then\r\nflitted away through the undergrowth, so that I scarcely saw him go.\r\nAnd when I came upon him again he repeated the maneuver.\r\n\r\nWith all their alertness, the birds have a large store of curiosity.\r\nDr. Sutton (1930) has remarked that some individuals will “fly up\r\nhastily and boldly upon hearing a commotion in the woods.” They may\r\nsometimes be called up by imitating their cry, by clapping together\r\nthe cupped palms of one’s hands, or by pounding with a billet of wood\r\nupon a tree trunk. I was following one morning a forest trail, where I\r\nknew a pair of the woodpeckers to be in residence, and had a glimpse,\r\nas I walked, of a large bird flying away. There stood against the sky,\r\nin the direction of the retreat, the stub of a great treetop. Pausing\r\nin my tracks, I waited until, after a few minutes, the suspected\r\nwoodpecker came leaping up the stub--to have a look at me, as I\r\nsupposed. In such case, the square shoulders of the bird, the slender\r\nwhite-striped neck, and the hammer head with its pointed scarlet crest\r\nare very conspicuous.\r\n\r\nMaurice Brooks (1934) has remarked upon the playfulness of the birds\r\nwhen at ease.\r\n\r\nFor all their alertness, it remains still to be said that on occasion,\r\nwhen the birds are feeding, or when tending a nestful of young, it\r\nis possible to approach quietly and to remain watching, while they,\r\nunheeding, continue their activities.\r\n\r\nIt is common to find hairy and downy woodpeckers associated with the\r\npileated, both on nesting grounds and when feeding. There is here, I\r\nbelieve, some measure of commensalism. I have in mind an observation\r\nupon a downy on the same dead hemlock tree with a pileated woodpecker.\r\nThe larger bird was scaling off the bark and feeding; the smaller\r\nseemed to be gleaning over areas the pileated had left.\r\n\r\nTucked in the niche formed by a great furrowlike incision in the bole\r\nof a basswood tree, and about 10 feet from the ground, I once found a\r\nnest of the olive-backed thrush.\r\n\r\nWhen I cut down the stub of which I have spoken, and which contained\r\nfour old nesting cavities of the pileated woodpecker, I found the\r\nlowest, 25 feet from the ground, to be occupied by a family of\r\nwhite-footed mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_), and I have no doubt\r\nthat these cavities, after their abandonment by the woodpeckers, are\r\ncommonly used by flying squirrels, by owls, and by tree-nesting ducks.\r\n\r\nProf. Brooks (1934) has most engagingly described the enticement of\r\npileated woodpeckers to come to feeding trays, and, incidentally, has\r\nadduced evidence of their traits of caution and of curiosity. To this\r\nhe adds (MS.): “I have indicated, in an article in Bird-Lore, that\r\nwe have found Pileated Woodpeckers something of clowns. The gourd\r\nexperience described in the above-mentioned article seemed to be in a\r\nspirit of play. The evident curiosity displayed by many birds observed\r\nis noteworthy; under its urge they apparently lose much of their fear.\r\nAround our blinds they have used a slow and cautious approach, but\r\nonce at the feeding shelves, they have not been particularly nervous\r\nor excitable. At times I have found them surprisingly tame in the open\r\nwoods.”\r\n\r\nThe pileated woodpecker lives, as has been said, almost entirely within\r\nthe forest cover. Its flight is commonly a matter of gliding and of\r\nslow-measured flapping through the trees. Its appearance then is\r\nunmistakable--large and black, with a flashing pattern of white beneath\r\nthe wings, and a gleaming scarlet crest.\r\n\r\nAt times it rises above the treetops and moves over greater distances,\r\nand then its manner of flight bears greater likeness to the typical\r\nbounding or galloping flight of the generality of woodpeckers. Its\r\noutline against the sky is not unlike a kingfisher’s. Dr. Sutton (1930)\r\ndescribes an encounter in the Pennsylvania mountains with a bird that\r\n“cackled for about fifteen minutes, pounding intermittently on a tree\r\ntrunk. It then rose in air, mounted to a plane above the tree-tops,\r\nand flew in direct course down the valley, uttering a single, loud,\r\neven-toned _puck_ about every two seconds, as far as we could hear it.\r\nThe bird was still flying high when it faded from view.”\r\n\r\nCornelius Weygandt (1912) described from Monroe County, Pa., the\r\nappearance of “the Logcock that in late July and early August made the\r\nsunset hour more memorable by its passing”:\r\n\r\n     It was on the evening of July 26 that we first saw him\r\n     * * * we noticed a large bird flying heron-like toward\r\n     us. He passed us and made his way onward toward a tall\r\n     broken-topped gum tree that stood out black against the\r\n     sunset. He “landed” on its side near the top, woodpecker\r\n     fashion, and bobbed downtrunk backwards for several yards.\r\n     The sky was mauve and gold and crimson, and the great\r\n     bird loomed blacker and bigger than he really was, limned\r\n     sharply against it. He had not dropped along like the\r\n     smaller woodpeckers, but had kept on more steadily, very\r\n     like a heron, with only slight risings and fallings. After\r\n     a rest on the gum tree of some three minutes he flung\r\n     himself into the air and dove down into the Buck Hill Gorge.\r\n\r\nVickers (1915) characterizes the bird’s flight as “powerful and\r\nstraight-forward, his head and neck carrying his powerful beak like\r\na spear * * * [the bird] large as a crow and with a certain short,\r\nsturdy, kingfisherlike aspect.”\r\n\r\nIn general conclusion it may be said that the pileated woodpecker has\r\nthe habit and manner of a giant, forest-loving flicker.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Throughout the greater part of the year the pileated\r\nwoodpecker is a relatively silent bird, but during the nesting season\r\ndrumming and calling are frequent. The usual call is a cackle,\r\nresembling that of the flicker, though louder and of more sonorous\r\nquality. The “song” of the white-breasted nuthatch so far resembles it\r\nin pitch and tempo that a nuthatch near at hand may, for an instant,\r\nsuggest the woodpecker far away. The _ka, ka, ka_ of the woodpecker’s\r\ncackle is variable in quality, in speed of iteration, and in\r\ncontinuity, and seems to be expressive, sometimes of alarm, sometimes\r\nof companionship, sometimes of contentment. Aretas A. Saunders (1935)\r\nhas noted that often there is rise in pitch at the beginning of a\r\nrendition and a slight fall at the end; and Samuel Scoville, Jr.\r\n(1920), distinguishing this from the flicker’s similar call, has\r\nremarked on “a queer little quirk at the end.” When a pair of birds\r\ncackle in alternation, as commonly they do, a difference in pitch will\r\nbe noted; but whether that be a constant sexual difference, or a matter\r\nof individuality merely, I cannot say.\r\n\r\nIn the nesting season the mated birds have another flickerlike\r\n_wuck-a-wuck_ call that seems to be peculiarly associated with their\r\nconjugal relationship. They use it in courtship and when they relieve\r\none another in attendance at the nest.\r\n\r\nDr. Sutton (1930) mentions yet another call and describes it as\r\n“whining notes, suggesting the _mew_ of the yellow-bellied sapsucker.”\r\nBut it is more than that. It is a loud cry, that resembles the scream\r\nof a hawk. It is commonly reiterated slowly in five or six repetitions.\r\nUnless one were to follow the sound and discover its source, he would\r\nhardly impute it to this bird. It too, I believe, is a call peculiar to\r\nthe nesting season.\r\n\r\nWhen the bird is in flight a slowly uttered _puck, puck_ may sometimes\r\nbe heard, and sometimes what for lack of a better term may be called a\r\ncreaking of the moving wings.\r\n\r\nBesides these there is a high-pitched scream--“a bugle call,” says\r\nFlorence Merriam Bailey (1902), with which the bird greets the rising\r\nsun. Horace W. Wright (1912) has noted that in June the bird is first\r\nheard within a few minutes after sunrise and has described the\r\nawakening thus: “There are eight records, when a bird has been heard\r\nloudly rapping in the distance with slow and measured blows or has\r\ncalled lustily and long, sometimes answered by another.”\r\n\r\n_Enemies._--The number of eggs laid suggests that there must be\r\nsome wastage: that somewhere in the round of life the bird must be\r\npeculiarly exposed to destruction; and to this point Dr. Sutton (1930)\r\nspeaks:\r\n\r\n     The Duck Hawk (_Rhynchodon peregrinus anatum_) appears to\r\n     be the chief, indeed perhaps the only, natural enemy of\r\n     this woodpecker in this State [Pennsylvania]. At Spruce\r\n     Creek, Huntingdon County, where these falcons have nested\r\n     for years, I found, on March 21, 1921, the head and plumage\r\n     of a male woodpecker which had not been dead long. Near\r\n     Palmerton, Carbon County, I saw a Duck Hawk pursue and with\r\n     ease strike down a pileated woodpecker that had started\r\n     to fly across the river. The hawk flew so fast that the\r\n     woodpecker seemed to have been unaware of the pursuit. A\r\n     cloud of feathers burst from the body of the victim as\r\n     it collapsed. The duck hawk apparently winters regularly\r\n     along some of our streams, and takes whatever comes along,\r\n     with a preference, perhaps, for the somewhat larger birds;\r\n     and to it the comparatively clumsy log cock falls easy\r\n     prey. So far as I know, neither the great horned owl nor\r\n     the Cooper’s hawk ever captures the bird, and our stomach\r\n     examinations of several hundred Goshawks revealed none\r\n     of its bones or plumage, though this savage predator no\r\n     doubt occasionally captures such birds as are to be found\r\n     throughout the winter.\r\n\r\nR. B. Simpson (1910) wrote: “I once shot a Sharp-shinned Hawk that was\r\nmaking a desperate attempt to catch a pileated * * *. A year or two ago\r\nin summer along a trout stream in virgin forest back in the mountains\r\n[of northern Pennsylvania], I came to a mossy spot where a pileated had\r\nbeen wrecked and a close inspection showed the tracks of a huge wildcat\r\nwho had no doubt caught the big woodpecker on the ground or on a log.”\r\nSee also Bendire (1895).\r\n\r\nIn addition to man’s disturbance of habitat with which this paper has\r\nhad largely to do, the following matters are noteworthy:\r\n\r\nPennant (1785) wrote that the Indians made a practice of decking their\r\ncalumets with the crests of these birds. And see Bendire (1895).\r\n\r\nAudubon (1842) said of the pileated woodpecker: “Its flesh is tough, of\r\na bluish tint, and smells so strongly of the worms and insects on which\r\nit generally feeds, as to be extremely unpalatable.” Sutton (1930),\r\nhowever, was able to show, both by the testimony of living witnesses\r\nand by written record as well, that these birds, along with other\r\nsmaller birds, were once commonly exposed for sale as food in city\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) wrote:\r\n\r\n     I have occasionally seen bunches of these birds, numbering\r\n     from four to twelve, exposed for sale in the markets of\r\n     Washington, D. C. * * * I tried to eat one, when short of\r\n     meat, while traveling through the Blue Mountains of Oregon,\r\n     but I certainly can not recommend it. It feeds to a great\r\n     extent on the large black wood ants, which impart to it a\r\n     very peculiar, and to me an extremely unpleasant flavor,\r\n     a kind of sweet-sour taste, which any amount of seasoning\r\n     and cooking does not disguise, and I consider it as a very\r\n     unpalatable substitute for game of any kind.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--As is true of other members of the family, the pileated\r\nwoodpecker may in fall be found digging for himself a cavity for winter\r\noccupancy. Few birds other than the woodpeckers make what may be\r\ncalled habitations, except as part of or incident to the activities of\r\nreproduction. And in the case of the woodpeckers, while I know that in\r\nparticular instances these winter retreats are not so used, I am unable\r\nto say that they never are subsequently used as nesting cavities.\r\n\r\nHoyes Lloyd (1932) wrote:\r\n\r\n     One of the most delightful bird adventures we have had at\r\n     Rockcliffe Park [near the City of Ottawa] was the visit\r\n     to us of a pileated woodpecker. It first came at 4:30 p. m.,\r\n     on October 12, 1928, and excavated a hole in a hollow\r\n     basswood for sleeping quarters * * *. The chips, from live\r\n     wood, were up to three inches by two inches in area, and\r\n     an eighth of an inch thick. Each chip had two or three\r\n     gouge-like beak marks across its surface. At 4:50 p. m.\r\n     on the next day the pileated came home, and although we\r\n     were all outdoors, it went directly to its own tree and\r\n     after a brief survey of affairs in the vicinity, retired.\r\n     The approach was silent except, possibly for a single\r\n     Flicker-like note in the distance. About 9 a. m., on\r\n     the 14th, our bird woke me up with a loud _kuk-kuk-kuk_\r\n     call and it looked very large as it climbed up the home\r\n     basswood. Promptly at quarter to five it came home,\r\n     undoubtedly after a day among the big hardwoods of the\r\n     neighborhood. We were all impressed by its great length of\r\n     neck, as it swung its head with a curious bobbing motion,\r\n     that was used, without doubt, to give a view on each side\r\n     of the home tree, before going into the hole for the night.\r\n     A pileated, thought to be the same bird, came back on March\r\n     22, 1929, possibly, or certainly on the 23rd, and slept in\r\n     its winter home.\r\n\r\nProf. Brooks writes (MS.): “At French Creek [Upshur County, W. Va.],\r\ntwo birds used a nesting cavity as a roosting place during the\r\nfollowing winter.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               CEOPHLOEUS PILEATUS FLORIDANUS (Ridgway)\r\n\r\n                      FLORIDA PILEATED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThis is the race that is supposed to inhabit central and southern\r\nFlorida, as far north as Orange County, but there seems to be some\r\ndoubt as to the desirability of naming it. Ridgway (1914) describes it\r\nas “similar to _P. p. pileatus_, but decidedly blacker (that is, the\r\ngeneral black color less slaty or sooty), and average size less, with\r\nbill usually relatively shorter and broader.” But he admits his doubt,\r\nin a footnote, saying:\r\n\r\n     I have found it very difficult to decide as to the\r\n     propriety of separating a form of this species from central\r\n     and southern Florida, but after having several times laid\r\n     out and carefully compared the entire series of specimens\r\n     from more southern localities, have come to the conclusion\r\n     that to do so will, apparently, best express the facts of\r\n     the case. Going by size alone, there is little difference\r\n     between specimens from southern and central Florida\r\n     and those from localities as far northward as Maryland\r\n     (lowlands), southern Illinois, and Missouri; in fact some\r\n     of these more northern specimens are quite as small as\r\n     Florida ones. But the series from central and southern\r\n     Florida are uniformly decidedly blacker than the rest. * * *\r\n     I have restricted the name _pileatus_ to an intermediate\r\n     form, characterized by the small size of _P. p. floridanus_\r\n     combined with an appreciably lighter (more slaty or sooty)\r\n     coloration, often approaching closely the lightness of hue\r\n     of _P. p. abieticola_.\r\n\r\nBangs (1898), in separating the northern race from the southern, says\r\nthat “southern South Carolina must be considered the type locality\r\nof the species, and birds from this region are as extreme of the\r\nsouthern race as those from Florida.” Furthermore, Arthur H. Howell\r\n(1932) observes that “careful study of a large series from Florida\r\nin comparison with a series of typical _pileatus_ from the Middle\r\nStates shows no constant difference in color, as claimed by Ridgway\r\nfor the subspecies ‘_floridanus_’; evidently specimens kept for some\r\nyears become more brownish (less sooty), which fact probably explains\r\nRidgway’s mistake, he having compared fresh Florida skins with older\r\nskins from the Middle States.” Probably, also, if specimens from the\r\ntwo regions in similar seasonal plumage were compared, there would\r\nnot be so much difference in coloration as Ridgway claims. Even if\r\nRidgway is correct in his diagnosis, it would seem unwise, in the\r\nauthor’s opinion, to recognize the Florida race and thus establish an\r\nintermediate race, where the gradation in both size and color warrants\r\nthe naming of only the two extremes.\r\n\r\nMr. Howell (1932) says of its haunts: “The pileated woodpecker in\r\nFlorida inhabits several different types of country--pine woods,\r\ncypress swamps, hardwood swamps, and hammocks of cabbage palmetto and\r\nother trees. The birds are perhaps most numerous in hammocks or swamps,\r\nwhere there is an abundance of decaying trees.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Mr. Howell (1932) writes: “We found a number of pairs\r\nbreeding in cypress trees along the borders of Lake Istokpoga. The\r\nnests are excavated either in living trees or in rotten stubs, from\r\n12 to 75 feet from the ground. The trees commonly used for nesting\r\nsites are cypress, pine, black gum, oak, and cabbage palmetto.” While\r\ncollecting in the Florida Keys in 1908, I found a pair of pileated\r\nwoodpeckers nesting on Murrays Key on April 3 and surprised one of the\r\nbirds working in its nesting hole; the excavation was about 12 feet\r\nfrom the ground in the main trunk of a live black mangrove, which stood\r\nin the inner fringe of mangroves around the borders of the island. I\r\nclimbed up to it and reached into the cavity but could not touch the\r\nbottom of it; we were unable to visit the island again.\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) writes:\r\n\r\n     In southern Florida the mating season commences early in\r\n     March, and farther north correspondingly later. A suitable\r\n     tree having been selected, generally a dead one in large\r\n     and extensive woods, both birds work alternately on the\r\n     nesting site. This is usually excavated in the main trunk,\r\n     from 12 to 75 feet from the ground, and it takes from seven\r\n     to twelve days to complete it. The entrance measures from\r\n     3 to 3½ inches in diameter, and it often goes 5 inches\r\n     straight into the trunk before it is worked downward.\r\n     The cavity varies from 7 to 30 inches in depth, and is\r\n     gradually enlarged toward the bottom, where it is about 6\r\n     inches wide. A layer of chips is left at the bottom, on\r\n     which the eggs are deposited. Occasionally the entrance\r\n     hole, instead of being circular, is oval in shape, like\r\n     that of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker. The inside of the\r\n     cavity is quite smooth, the edges of the entrance are\r\n     nicely beveled, and, taken as a whole, it is quite an\r\n     artistic piece of work.\r\n\r\nDr. William L. Ralph told Bendire of a clever trick practiced by this\r\nwoodpecker; he found a nest “in the second week in April, about the\r\ntime nidification is at its height there. On rapping on the trunk\r\nof the tree the bird, which was at home, stuck his head out of the\r\nhole and dropped some chips, naturally causing the Doctor to believe\r\nthat the nesting site was still unfinished. The same performance was\r\nrepeated on several subsequent visits, and finally he concluded to\r\nexamine the nest anyhow, when he found nearly full-grown young. This\r\npair of birds must have had eggs at the time he first discovered the\r\nnest, and the chips were simply thrown out as a ruse to deceive him.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--This woodpecker lays, ordinarily, three or four eggs, rarely\r\nfive. These are indistinguishable from those of the species from other\r\nsouthern States. The measurements of 22 eggs average 33.61 by 24.75\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =36.2= by 24.5,\r\n35.70 by =26.19=, =31.5= by 24.0, and 34.2 by =22.8= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Mr. Howell (1932) states that “this large woodpecker\r\nis a decidedly useful species. It never injures farm crops, but\r\nfeeds entirely in the forests, rendering good service there in the\r\ndestruction of wood-boring beetles. It eats, also, ants and wild fruits\r\nand berries, including the fruit of the sour gum, tupelo gum, dogwood,\r\npersimmon, frost grape, holly, poison ivy, sumac, and hackberry.” C.\r\nJ. Maynard (1896) says that they “are partial to the berries of the\r\npalmetto, feeding, in Florida, upon little else when these are in\r\nseason.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  CEOPHLOEUS PILEATUS PICINUS (Bangs)\r\n\r\n                      WESTERN PILEATED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nIn describing and naming this large, dark-colored race from the\r\nNorthwest coast region, Outram Bangs (1910) says that it is “as large\r\nas, or even larger than, _P. pileatus abieticola_ (Bangs), but color\r\nsooty black as in _P. pileatus pileatus_ (Linn.), the throat usually\r\nmuch marked with sooty, and the sides and flanks but slightly marked\r\nwith grayish.”\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) writes of its haunts: “In the mountains of Oregon,\r\nand presumably in other localities, the pileated woodpecker is most\r\nfrequently met with in the extensive burnt tracts, the so-called\r\n‘deadenings,’ where forest fires have swept through miles of fine\r\ntimber and killed everything in its path. Such localities afford this\r\nspecies an abundant food supply in the slowly decaying trees, and are\r\nsure to atract them.”\r\n\r\nGrinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale (1930) say that in the Lassen Peak region\r\nin California “individuals of this woodpecker were found in or among\r\nwhite firs, red firs, incense cedars, and yellow pines. Foraging birds\r\nwere often working on rotting stumps or logs close to the ground.\r\nAlmost invariably, even when in the tops of tall trees, the birds were\r\non dead or softened wood.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--J. A. Munro (1923) says: “In southern British Columbia\r\nnesting begins early in May. The nest is a chiselled hole in a\r\ntree, fourteen to eighteen inches deep, cut occasionally in a green\r\ncottonwood or poplar, more often in a dead pine or fir, and rarely in\r\nany but the tallest trees and at a considerable distance above the\r\nground. On a cushion of fine chips three or four rose-white eggs are\r\nlaid.”\r\n\r\nCarriger and Wells (1919) give an interesting account of the nesting\r\nof the western pileated woodpecker in Placer County, Calif. The first\r\nnest, containing young birds, was found early in June 1915. “The tree\r\nstood about fifteen feet from the shore of the lake and in about five\r\nfeet of water. At its base the diameter was about eighteen inches, at\r\nthe nest entrance about ten. The tree was a live aspen. * * *\r\n\r\n“The nest cavity was eighteen inches deep and six inches in diameter,\r\nwhile the entrance was three inches in width. The entire excavation had\r\nbeen made in live wood although there were plenty of large dead trees\r\nnear by.”\r\n\r\nOn May 16, 1916, they returned to this locality and found the birds\r\nnesting in the same tree in a new hole “located three feet higher\r\nup and on the opposite side of the tree.” The nest contained three\r\nnewly hatched young and one unhatched egg. Another visit was made the\r\nfollowing year, on May 5, but the woodpeckers “had abandoned the lake\r\nand were making their home in a tree located in the channel of a small\r\nstream which flowed into the lake and about three hundred yards from\r\ntheir former site. The nest was found to be about half completed.\r\nVisits were made to it on several occasions until May 26, but the birds\r\nwere not seen again.”\r\n\r\nIn 1918 they were more successful. There was practically no water in\r\nthe lake; and, on May 2, a search was “made through the aspen grove\r\nwhich in former years had stood in its entirety in from two to seven\r\nor eight feet of water, with the result that Mr. Flickinger discovered\r\na fresh hole forty feet up in a live aspen growing close to the lake\r\nshore.” The nest had been completed, but no eggs had been laid.\r\nReturning on May 12, they collected a set of four fresh eggs. They say:\r\n\r\n     The nest cavity was eighteen inches deep by about six in\r\n     diameter, while the entrance was nearly four inches across.\r\n\r\n     The nest was visited again on June 1 by both of us, and\r\n     to our surprise we found that the birds had used the same\r\n     cavity for a second set of eggs, four in number, which\r\n     were three-quarters incubated. The short time intervening\r\n     between the two sets shows that the birds did not lose any\r\n     time after their first set was lost to them. The locality\r\n     was again visited on June 30 and we found that the birds\r\n     had finished another cavity about two hundred feet from\r\n     the first tree and apparently the female was brooding a\r\n     third set. We did not disturb the bird and hope that she\r\n     successfully raised her brood.\r\n\r\n     Inasmuch as the lake contained no water at this point we\r\n     made a careful search of the upper end of the basin with\r\n     the result that twenty cavities in all were located in\r\n     various trees in what is usually the lake or very close to\r\n     its shores. Most of these cavities were in live aspens.\r\n     Apparently this pair of birds has nested here for a great\r\n     many years, for although we have carefully worked the\r\n     surrounding country for miles in every direction we have\r\n     never discovered other birds or their cavities.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The western pileated woodpecker apparently lays either three\r\nor four eggs; I have no record of five. The eggs are indistinguishable\r\nfrom those of the northern pileated woodpecker. The measurements of two\r\neggs in the P. B. Philipp collection are 30.9 by 23 and 29.6 by 22.9\r\nmillimeters. W. L. Dawson (1923) gives the average measurement as 32.5\r\nby 24.1 millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Mrs. Irene G. Wheelock (1904) gives the following interesting\r\naccount of the young:\r\n\r\n     The parents are very devoted to their treasures whether\r\n     they be eggs or infant woodpeckers, and the male rarely\r\n     fails to stand on guard on a high perch ready to warn and\r\n     defend should possible danger threaten. The method of\r\n     feeding is like that of the flickers, by regurgitation for\r\n     the first two weeks or longer. The adult comes with gular\r\n     pouch full of food and alights at one side of the nest hole\r\n     to rest a moment. Though he may have come noiselessly and\r\n     from the other side of the tree, yet his approach is always\r\n     heralded by a mowing-machine chorus from the young, plainly\r\n     heard some yards away. If old enough, the queer-looking\r\n     little heads are thrust out of the doorway, and the parent,\r\n     inserting his long bill into the open mouth of a youngling,\r\n     shakes it vigorously, thereby emptying the food from his\r\n     throat into that of his offspring. Each in turn is fed in\r\n     this odd fashion. * * *\r\n\r\n     For a week or two after the young have left the nest,\r\n     they follow their parents begging for food with ludicrous\r\n     eagerness; at this time the provender brought them consists\r\n     of nuts, berries, ants, and the larvae of beetles. These,\r\n     especially the nuts, are often placed in a crevice of the\r\n     bark, and the youngster is compelled to pick them out.\r\n     After a few trials he learns to hammer right merrily and is\r\n     ready to forage for himself.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The western pileated woodpecker lives on much the same kind\r\nof food as its eastern relative, but naturally on different species of\r\ninsects and berries. Dr. Harold C. Bryant (1916) examined the stomach\r\nof one, taken in Lake County, Calif., on November 5, 1915, and says:\r\n“The stomach contained more than fifty carpenter ants (_Camponotus\r\nherculaneus_ subsp.) and 131 seeds of poison oak (_Rhus diversiloba_).\r\nAs the seeds of poison oak are hard and without a noticeable covering\r\nof softer material it is difficult to understand what there is about\r\nthem that is attractive to birds. Certain it is that the seeds are\r\nincapable of complete digestion by woodpeckers.” And he adds: “The\r\nstomachs of two pileated woodpeckers taken in or near Yosemite National\r\nPark * * * were filled with carpenter ants (_Camponotus herculaneus\r\nmodoc_ Wheeler), many of them winged. Each stomach contained more than\r\na hundred of these ants. In addition one stomach contained a whole\r\nfruit of manzanita (_Arctostaphylos nevadensis_ Gray) and the other,\r\nfour large beetle larvae (_Cerambycidae_), unidentifiable as to genus\r\nor species, which had evidently been dug out of some dead tree, as the\r\nstomach contained slivers of dead wood.”\r\n\r\nJ. A. Munro (1930) writes: “On December 2, 1926, a pileated woodpecker\r\nwas seen scrambling among the thick entwined branches of Virginia\r\ncreeper that partly covered the walls of a house situated on the shore\r\nof Okanagan Lake. Here it remained for twenty minutes, busily picking\r\noff the fruit. Subsequently, during the month of December, it often\r\nwas observed eating these berries at the same place and likewise at a\r\nvine-covered house half a mile distant. Sometimes it appeared at both\r\nhouses on the same day, but more often only one house was visited.”\r\n\r\nCharles W. Michael (1928) gives the following interesting account:\r\n\r\n     Beside the road, with branches overhanging it, stands a\r\n     group of mountain dogwoods (_Cornus nuttalli_). These\r\n     trees bore this year a heavy crop of fruit. At the end of\r\n     each flower stalk was a bunched cluster of ripe berries.\r\n     The Pileated Woodpecker was here today [September 19] to\r\n     collect his toll of fruit. The fruit being at the ends\r\n     of slender branches we thought the heavy-bodied bird\r\n     would be out of luck. How could the big fellow reach the\r\n     fruit? He was apparently not just sure himself. At first\r\n     he tried walking out the heavier branches; but always as\r\n     he approached the tip-ends they bent under his weight and\r\n     threw the berries beyond reach. By working out on a cedar\r\n     branch that intermingled with the dogwood branches he did\r\n     manage to get a taste of fruit, just enough to tease his\r\n     appetite. He was not to be cheated, however; for his next\r\n     move was to flutter clumsily up to a branch containing\r\n     berries, clutch the branch firmly with his strong feet, and\r\n     then drop to swing like a great pendulum. He now had the\r\n     system. Swinging head down he would pick the berries one by\r\n     one, loosen his hold, swing into flight and then repeat the\r\n     performance on another branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 MELANERPES ERYTHROCEPHALUS (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\n                         RED-HEADED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                             PLATES 25-27\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThis handsome and conspicuously colored woodpecker enjoys a wide\r\ndistribution over much of North America, from southern Canada to the\r\nGulf coast, east of the Rocky Mountains, and west of New England and\r\neastern Canada. It is recorded from British Columbia, and is rare in\r\nNew England. The only one I have seen in southeastern Massachusetts, in\r\n50 years of field work, was chased across the line from Rhode Island\r\nbefore I shot it. Throughout the northern portion of its range, it is a\r\nsummer resident only, though in mild winters, when food is abundant, it\r\nmay remain all through winter.\r\n\r\nThe red-headed woodpecker is essentially a bird of the open country\r\nand not in any sense a forest dweller. I first met this woodpecker in\r\nnorthern New York while on a fishing trip on the St. Lawrence River;\r\nhere it was fairly common in open groves of large trees or in groups of\r\nscattered trees in open fields, where its brilliant color pattern made\r\nit very conspicuous; it was frequently seen sitting on telegraph poles,\r\nfence posts, the dead tops of tall trees, or on dead stubs. Dr. Elon H.\r\nEaton (1914) says of its haunts in that State: “The preferred home of\r\nthis woodpecker is in open groves and ‘slashings’ and ‘old burns’ and\r\ntracts of half-dead forest where the live trees are scattered and dead\r\nstubs are in abundance.”\r\n\r\nSpencer Trotter (1903) writes: “I first saw the bird on a certain\r\nhill-side in Maryland that was grown up with tall white-oaks,\r\nnot thickly, but open enough for a sheep-pasture, with vistas of\r\nclose-cropped grass among the gray tree-trunks. In this setting a\r\nWoodpecker winged before me from tree to tree with its strongly\r\ncontrasted blotches of black, white, and crimson flashing in the\r\nsunlight.”\r\n\r\nIn Florida I have found it most commonly in the large burned-over\r\nareas in the pine woods, where numerous dead trees and stubs are left\r\nstanding; these offer attractive nesting sites and some food supply.\r\nBut Arthur H. Howell (1932) says: “The red-head is the most domestic of\r\nour woodpeckers, living frequently in the heart of populous towns and\r\nnesting in telephone poles on village streets. The birds are especially\r\nattracted to newly cleared lands, where many dead or girdled trees are\r\nleft standing. They are common, also, in open pine forests in certain\r\nsections, but in other seemingly suitable localities are not to be\r\nfound.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--As my experience with the nesting habits of the red-headed\r\nwoodpecker is almost nothing, I shall have to draw on the observations\r\nof others. Major Bendire (1895) makes the following general statement:\r\n\r\n     Some of its nesting sites are exceedingly neat pieces\r\n     of work; the edges of the entrance hole are beautifully\r\n     beveled off, and the inside is as smooth as if finished\r\n     with a fine rasp. The entrance is about 1¾ inches in\r\n     diameter and the inner cavity varies from 8 to 24 inches\r\n     in depth; the eggs are deposited on a layer of fine chips.\r\n     It usually nests in the dead tops or limbs of deciduous\r\n     trees, or in old stumps of oak, ash, butternut, maple,\r\n     elm, sycamore, cottonwood, willow, and other species,\r\n     more rarely in coniferous and fruit trees, at heights\r\n     varying from 8 to 80 feet from the ground, and also not\r\n     infrequently in natural cavities. On the treeless prairies\r\n     it has to resort mainly to telegraph poles and fence posts,\r\n     and here it also nests under the roofs of houses or in any\r\n     dark corner it can find.\r\n\r\nJohn Helton, Jr., tells me that in Alabama the favorite nesting site is\r\nin a rotten stump from which the bark has peeled off; he very seldom\r\nfinds a nest in a tree with bark on it. M. G. Vaiden sends me a note\r\non a nest that was only 5 feet from the ground in a limb of a-dead oak\r\nnear Rosedale, Miss. The nests are often placed near houses or in trees\r\non town or village streets. Two broods are often raised in a season\r\nand sometimes in the same cavity; A. D. DuBois tells, in his notes, of\r\nsuch a Minnesota nest; the earlier brood had been raised in a newly\r\nexcavated cavity that was 14 inches deep; the second set of eggs was\r\nlaid at a depth of only 9 inches, the bed for the eggs having been\r\nraised 5 inches by chiseling fresh chips from the inner walls of the\r\ncavity. Dr. H. C. Oberholser (1896b) gives the average measurements of\r\nfour Ohio nests as follows: Total depth 10.75; diameter of entrance\r\n2.06 by 1.66; diameter at entrance 3.81 by 2.69; diameter at middle\r\n4.50 by 3.88; and diameter at bottom 4.41 by 3.35 inches.\r\n\r\nIn the prairie regions and in other places, where trees are scarce and\r\nthese woodpeckers are common, some unusual and odd nesting sites have\r\nbeen noted. Kumlien and Hollister (1903) write: “Among some of the odd\r\nnesting sites we have noted are the following: Between two flat rails\r\non an old style rail fence; the hub of a broken wagon wheel, leaning\r\nagainst a fence; the box of a grain drill left standing in a field; a\r\nhole excavated in the hollow cylinder of an ordinary pump; common fence\r\nposts and telegraph poles. These were usually in prairie regions where\r\nthere were few, if any, suitable trees.”\r\n\r\nG. S. Agersborg (1881) mentions a nest that “was in the angle formed\r\nby the shares of an upturned plow” in South Dakota. And E. A. Stoner\r\n(1915) flushed a red-headed woodpecker from a blue jay’s nest in\r\nIowa. “The nest was eight feet up in an oak sapling and was a typical\r\nBlue Jay’s but was found to contain three pure white and unmistakably\r\nWoodpecker eggs.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Major Bendire (1895) writes: “The number of eggs to a set\r\nvaries from four to seven, sets of five being most frequently found,\r\nwhile occasionally as many as eight eggs have been taken from a nest.\r\nMr. R. C. McGregor records taking a set of ten eggs of the red-head,\r\nvarying in size from ordinary down to that of the song sparrow.\r\nIncubation varied from fresh in the smallest egg to advanced in the\r\nlarger (Oologist, vol. 5, p. 44, 1888).”\r\n\r\nIf the first set of eggs is taken, another set will be completed within\r\nthe next 10 or 12 days, usually in the same hole. Like the flicker,\r\nthis woodpecker is very persistent in its attempt to raise a brood and\r\nwill keep on laying, if repeatedly robbed. C. C. Bacon (1891), of Bell,\r\nKy., reports taking six sets of eggs, 28 eggs in all, from the same\r\nnest in a single season, after which the birds drilled a new hole in\r\nthe same tree and raised a brood of four young; this persevering pair\r\ndrilled two holes and laid 32 eggs before they succeeded in raising a\r\nbrood.\r\n\r\nThe eggs vary in shape from short ovate to rounded ovate, are pure\r\nwhite in color, and somewhat glossy when incubated. The measurements of\r\n54 eggs average 25.14 by 19.17 millimeters; the eggs showing the four\r\nextremes measure =27.18= by 19.30, 26.16 by =20.57=, =23= by 18.20, and\r\n23.11 by =17.78= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Incubation is said to last for about 14 days. Both sexes\r\nassist in this duty, as well as in the care of the young. As an egg\r\nis laid each day, and, as incubation often begins before the set is\r\ncomplete, the young may hatch on different days.\r\n\r\nMr. DuBois writes to me that one nest that he watched held newly\r\nhatched young on June 11; they were in the nest on July 7 but had left\r\nbefore 2 p. m. on the 9th, making the period in the nest approximately\r\n27 days. He says: “The newly hatched, naked young have extremely long\r\nnecks, longer in fact than their bodies. The four young all faced\r\ninward, each toward a point to the right of the center of the nest; and\r\nwhen in repose, each neck crossed the necks of the two others at right\r\nangles to its own--like woof and warp in a loom. A little noise on my\r\npart made all four of them stretch their necks straight upward; but\r\nwhen they collapsed, their necks became again interwoven. Each lowered\r\nits head to its own right side of the one opposite it. There were egg\r\nshells still in the nest.”\r\n\r\nJulian K. Potter (1912) says of a nest that he watched at Camden, N. J.:\r\n\r\n     The old birds fed the young at varying intervals, sometimes\r\n     going to the nest once in every three or four minutes for a\r\n     half hour, then not appearing again for fifteen or twenty\r\n     minutes. * * *\r\n\r\n     The young birds left the nest about June 25. On that day\r\n     I saw them out in the open, quite able to take care of\r\n     themselves, although the parents fed them occasionally.\r\n     [This pair raised a second brood that season, and had\r\n     young on July 30.] Meanwhile the young of the first brood\r\n     were being very much misused by their parents, and were\r\n     driven away whenever they came in sight; in fact they\r\n     were persecuted to such an extent that they must have been\r\n     driven from the locality, for I was unable to find them\r\n     after July 30.\r\n\r\nSome writers have said that only one brood is raised in a season, and\r\nothers that two broods are raised only in the southern part of the\r\nbreeding range. But Mr. DuBois reports two broods in Minnesota; and Mr.\r\nPotter one brood one season and two broods the next season for his pair\r\nin New Jersey.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The young are hatched naked and blind, but they acquire\r\nthe juvenal plumage before they leave the nest. The sexes are alike\r\nin all plumages, and the juvenal plumage is quite unlike that of the\r\nadult. In the juvenal plumage, the head, neck, and upper chest are\r\nbrownish gray, spotted above and streaked below with dusky; the back\r\nis black but not glossy as in the adult; the wings are as in the\r\nadult, except that the secondaries and tertials are white but more\r\nor less patterned or barred with black, chiefly near the tips, and\r\nthe primaries are edged with buffy white on the outer webs; the under\r\nparts below the chest are dull white, clouded with brownish gray and\r\nmore or less streaked with dusky, chiefly on the sides and flanks.\r\nThis plumage is usually worn in its purity through July and August and\r\nsometimes into October, though sometimes a few red feathers are seen in\r\nthe head; I have seen two or three red feathers in the head as early\r\nas June 29 and a bird not much farther advanced on December 1. But\r\nusually the complete molt into the adult plumage begins in September\r\nand lasts through winter; the change begins on the head and back in\r\nfall, but the wings are not usually molted until April, and even then\r\nsome of the juvenal secondaries may be retained. Most young birds are\r\nin practically adult plumage before May.\r\n\r\nAdults have a complete postnuptial molt in August and September; they\r\nmay have a partial molt in spring, but I have not seen it. Some highly\r\nplumaged birds, probably old birds and mostly from western localities,\r\nhave the abdomen tinged with red.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Much has been written on the food habits of the red-headed\r\nwoodpecker, a most resourceful feeder on a greatly varied diet. Prof.\r\nF. E. L. Beal (1895) makes the following report on the contents of 101\r\nstomachs, collected throughout the year in various parts of the country:\r\n\r\n     Animal matter, 50 percent; vegetable matter, 47 percent;\r\n     mineral matter, 3 percent. * * * The insects consist of\r\n     ants, wasps, beetles, bugs, grasshoppers, crickets, moths,\r\n     and caterpillars. Spiders and myriapods also were found.\r\n     Ants amounted to about 11 percent of the whole food. * * *\r\n     Beetle remains formed nearly one-third of all food.\r\n     * * * The families represented were those of the common\r\n     May beetle (_Lachnosterna_), which was found in several\r\n     stomachs, the predaceous ground beetles, tiger beetles,\r\n     weevils, and a few others. * * * Weevils were found in 15\r\n     stomachs, and in several cases as many as 10 were present.\r\n     Remains of Carabid beetles were found in 44 stomachs to\r\n     an average amount of 24 percent of the contents of those\r\n     that contained them, or 10 percent of all. The fact that\r\n     43 percent of all the birds taken had eaten these beetles,\r\n     some of them to the extent of 16 individuals, shows a\r\n     decided fondness for these insects, and taken with the fact\r\n     that 5 stomachs contained Cicindelids or tiger beetles\r\n     forms a rather strong indictment against the bird.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable food includes corn, dogwood berries, huckleberries,\r\nstrawberries, blackberries, raspberries, mulberries, elderberries,\r\nwild black cherries, choke cherries, cultivated cherries, wild grapes,\r\napples, pears, various seeds, acorns, and beechnuts. Prof. Beal (1895)\r\nreports that--\r\n\r\n     corn was found in 17 stomachs, collected from May to\r\n     September, inclusive, and amounted to more than 7\r\n     percent of all the food. While it seems to be eaten in\r\n     any condition, that taken in the late summer was in the\r\n     milk, and evidently picked from standing ears. This * * *\r\n     corroborates some of the testimony received, and indicates\r\n     that the Redhead, if sufficiently abundant, might do\r\n     considerable damage to the growing crop, particularly if\r\n     other food was not at hand. While the fruit list is not so\r\n     long as in the case of the Flicker, it includes more kinds\r\n     that are, or may be, cultivated; and the quantity found\r\n     in the stomachs, a little more than 33 percent of all the\r\n     food, is greater than in any of the others. Strawberries\r\n     were found in 1 stomach, blackberries or raspberries in\r\n     15, cultivated cherries in 2, apples in 4, and pears in\r\n     6. Fruit pulp was found in 33 stomachs, and it is almost\r\n     certain that a large part of this was obtained from some of\r\n     the larger cultivated varieties. Seeds were found in but\r\n     few stomachs, and only a small number in each.\r\n\r\nAudubon (1842) gives this woodpecker a rather bad name, saying:\r\n\r\n     I would not recommend to anyone to trust their fruit to\r\n     the red-heads; for they not only feed on all kinds as\r\n     they ripen, but destroy an immense quantity besides. No\r\n     sooner are the cherries seen to redden, than these birds\r\n     attack them. * * * Trees of this kind are stripped clean\r\n     by them. * * * I may safely assert that a hundred have\r\n     been shot upon a single cherry-tree in one day. * * * They\r\n     have another bad habit, which is that of sucking the eggs\r\n     of small birds. For this purpose, they frequently try to\r\n     enter the boxes of the Martins or Bluebirds, as well as\r\n     the pigeon-houses, and are often successful. The corn, as\r\n     it ripens, is laid bare by their bill, when they feed on\r\n     the top parts of the ear, and leave the rest either to the\r\n     Grakles or the Squirrels, or still worse, to decay, after a\r\n     shower has fallen upon it.\r\n\r\nBendire (1895) adds to the evidence against this gay villain. He\r\npersonally saw a red-headed woodpecker rifle a nest of a red-shafted\r\nflicker and carry off an egg. He quotes from one observer who had\r\nseen one of these woodpeckers clean out a nest of young of the\r\ntufted titmouse, and from another who had seen one carrying off a\r\nfreshly killed young robin. W. G. Smith wrote to him from Colorado:\r\n“The red-headed woodpecker is a common summer resident in the lower\r\nfoothills along the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in this\r\nState, and I consider it a veritable butcher among our nuthatches and\r\nchickadees, driving every one away from its nesting sites, and woe to\r\nthe bird that this villain can reach. It destroys both eggs and young,\r\ndragging the latter out of their nests and frequently leaving them dead\r\nat the entrance of their holes.”\r\n\r\nHe also relates the following personal experience:\r\n\r\n     We noticed a red-headed woodpecker take something,\r\n     apparently a bunch of moss, from a crotch of a maple and\r\n     carry it to a fence post of an adjacent field. After\r\n     worrying some time in trying to swallow something rather\r\n     too large for his gullet, he finally succeeded, after an\r\n     effort, and then worked some little time, evidently trying\r\n     to secrete the remainder. Both of us had our field glasses\r\n     and were watching the bird’s actions closely. After some\r\n     little time he flew back to the tree he had started from,\r\n     while we proceeded to the fence post to investigate, and,\r\n     much to our disgust and surprise, we found the freshly\r\n     killed and partly eaten body of a young bird, almost\r\n     denuded of feathers, securely tucked away behind the loose\r\n     bark of the post. His victim was too much mutilated to\r\n     identify positively, but looked like a half-grown bluebird,\r\n     whose head had been crushed in, the brain abstracted, and\r\n     the entire rump and entrails torn out; the only parts left\r\n     intact were the breast, upper part of the back, and the\r\n     lower portion of the head. The missing parts had evidently\r\n     just been eaten by the rascal while clinging to the top of\r\n     the post, and the remnant was then hidden for future use.\r\n\r\nHoward Jones (1883), of Circleville, Ohio, reports the following\r\nincident:\r\n\r\n     Under the eaves of a large barn near Mt. Sterling, O., a\r\n     colony of Cliff Swallows have built for some years. Last\r\n     year they were nearly exterminated by several woodpeckers.\r\n     The redheads would alight at the doors of the mud huts and\r\n     extract the eggs from the nests with their bills. In some\r\n     nests the necks or entrance-ways were so long that the\r\n     woodpeckers could not reach the eggs by this means, but not\r\n     willing to be cheated of such choice food they would climb\r\n     around to the side, and with a few well directed blows of\r\n     their bills make openings large enough to enable them to\r\n     procure the eggs. Of the dozens of nests built not a single\r\n     brood was reared in any. One woodpecker bolder than the\r\n     rest began eating hen’s eggs wherever they could be found.\r\n\r\nMr. DuBois says in his notes: “A redhead, seeing a young lark sparrow\r\nflutter in the grass, attacked it and might have killed it, had I\r\nnot intervened. He had struck the young bird at one of his lores and\r\nhad brought blood. I have also seen this woodpecker attack a young\r\nbluebird, on the ground, just after it had left the nest.”\r\n\r\nBut not all red-headed woodpeckers are cannibals or murderers; perhaps\r\nmany individuals never indulge in such practices; and all of them have\r\nsome harmless and useful feeding habits. Their insect-eating habits\r\nare impressive. They are very fond of grasshoppers and destroy them in\r\nlarge numbers. H. B. Bailey (1878) quotes the following from a letter\r\nfrom G. S. Agersborg, of Vermillion, S. Dak.:\r\n\r\n     Last spring in opening a good many birds of this species\r\n     with the object of ascertaining their principal food, I\r\n     found in their stomachs nothing but young grasshoppers.\r\n     One of them, which had its headquarters near my house, was\r\n     observed making frequent visits to an old oak post, and on\r\n     examining it I found a large crack where the Woodpecker had\r\n     inserted about one hundred grasshoppers of all sizes (for\r\n     future use, as later observations proved), which were put\r\n     in without killing them, but they were so firmly wedged in\r\n     the crack that they in vain tried to get free. I told this\r\n     to a couple of farmers, and found that they had also seen\r\n     the same thing, and showed me the posts which were used for\r\n     the same purpose. Later in the season the Woodpecker, whose\r\n     station was near my house, commenced to use his stores, and\r\n     today (February 10) there are only a few shrivelled-up\r\n     grasshoppers left.\r\n\r\nMilton P. Skinner (1928), referring to the feeding habits of this\r\nwoodpecker in North Carolina, writes:\r\n\r\n     Flying insects are an important source of food supply all\r\n     through the winter, but with the increase of the number\r\n     of insects in March this activity greatly increases. The\r\n     observation post for fly-catching is usually the one in\r\n     which the nest hole is situated. But I noted at least one\r\n     bird that used four tall trees in succession for this\r\n     purpose. On February 1, 1927, a red-headed woodpecker was\r\n     seen clinging to the side of a telephone pole. Twice it\r\n     left the pole, flew out twenty feet, caught an insect each\r\n     time, and returned to the pole to eat it. Two weeks later\r\n     another bird was seen to make six trips similarly out\r\n     and back during six minutes, sometimes going more than a\r\n     hundred feet from its perch. As the bird went direct to the\r\n     insect, caught it and returned immediately to its perch,\r\n     it seemed likely that the insect was seen each time before\r\n     the bird started, indicating wonderful eyesight. While not\r\n     engaged in thus hawking, this bird hunted the limbs for\r\n     prey. Ten days later I found this bird watching for insects\r\n     and making ten fly-catching sallies in minute and a half.\r\n     Its flights were from ten to one hundred and fifty feet in\r\n     length, and all the insects were from forty to sixty feet\r\n     above the ground. One of the redheads seen fly-catching in\r\n     December, returned to its dead stub where it drilled for\r\n     grubs and borers in the usual woodpecker fashion, except\r\n     that its strokes were heavy and deliberate. On another\r\n     occasion, I saw one of these birds fly down into the road\r\n     to catch and eat an earthworm.\r\n\r\nE. D. Nauman (1930), in Iowa, watched a red-headed woodpecker feeding\r\na young bird in the top of a tall tree. “The adult bird was at work,\r\ndarting off every few moments into the air in pursuit of insects and\r\nreturning after each flight to the young bird on the tree with its\r\nprey. I watched and timed it carefully for an hour. It made from five\r\nto seven trips per minute, always at an elevation of 50 to 100 feet,\r\nand caught at each trip from one to three or more insects. * * *\r\n\r\n“A computation based upon careful observation showed that a single\r\nindividual Redhead had destroyed over 600 insects in one hour. When I\r\nleft, the bird was still at work, and I am, of course, unable to state\r\nhow long it had been at work at this place before I came there.”\r\n\r\nA. V. Goodpasture (1909), of Nashville, Tenn., made some interesting\r\nobservations on the feeding habits of this woodpecker. He watched one\r\npreparing insect food for its young on a stump, some 4 feet high, near\r\nits nest, and says:\r\n\r\n     When one of the woodpeckers came in, it did not go directly\r\n     to the nest, but always alighted first on this stump, where\r\n     it hammered away for a time, then proceeded to the nest\r\n     with a shapeless mass in its beak. My glass having failed\r\n     to disclose their object in thus lighting and hammering\r\n     on the stump before feeding their young, I went down to\r\n     reconnoiter. The place looked like a field hospital after a\r\n     severe engagement. There were wings, and wing-covers, heads\r\n     and legs strewn around the stump in great profusion. Then\r\n     I understood it all. The stump was their meat-block, and\r\n     they were preparing the food for their young by removing\r\n     the hard and indigestible parts. They dispatched this work\r\n     with much dexterity, without using their feet to confine\r\n     the insect; they laid it on the stump, and, with the bill\r\n     alone, succeeded in removing the undesirable parts.\r\n\r\n     The kinds of insects whose remains were found there was a\r\n     study. They were almost as gaudy as the woodpecker himself.\r\n     * * * Woodpeckers can undoubtedly distinguish between\r\n     colors; they find the ruddiest apple and the rosiest\r\n     peach in the orchard. In like manner, they seem to be\r\n     attracted by bright-colored insects. They prefer beautiful\r\n     butterflies, silky moths, and brilliant beetles. The\r\n     favorite food of this pair was the June-bug; not the plain\r\n     brown beetle of the northern states, but the beautiful\r\n     green and gold June-bug of the South--associated in the\r\n     mind with sultry summer days, and ripe blackberries, on\r\n     which he feeds. * * *\r\n\r\n     I found not only the dismembered wing-covers of the\r\n     June-bug around the Woodpecker’s meat-block, but, in a\r\n     pit on the splintered top of the stump, I found a live\r\n     June-bug. And what a prison he was in! It was a thousand\r\n     times worse than the Black Hole of Calcutta. They had\r\n     turned him on his back and pounded him into a cavity that\r\n     so exactly fitted him that he could move nothing but his\r\n     legs, which were plying like weaver’s shuttles in the empty\r\n     air. I always found the June-bugs deposited on their backs,\r\n     and always alive.\r\n\r\nThe red-headed woodpecker also shares with the California woodpecker\r\nthe provident habit of storing acorns and nuts. Fannie Hardy Eckstorm\r\n(1901) says:\r\n\r\n     Lately it has been discovered that they not only eat\r\n     beechnuts all the fall, but store them up for winter use.\r\n     This time the observation was made in Indiana. There, when\r\n     the nuts were abundant, the red-heads were seen busily\r\n     carrying them off. Their accumulations were found in all\r\n     sorts of places; cavities in old tree-trunks contained nuts\r\n     by the handful; knot-holes, cracks, crevices, seams in the\r\n     barns were filled full of nuts. Nuts were tucked into the\r\n     cracks in fence-posts; they were driven into railroad ties;\r\n     they were pounded in between the shingles on the roofs; if\r\n     a board was sprung out, the space behind it was filled with\r\n     nuts, and bark or wood was often brought to cover over the\r\n     gathered store.\r\n\r\nUnlike the California woodpecker, it does not make holes for the\r\nreception of the nuts but uses what cavities it can find. Dr. Thomas\r\nS. Roberts (1932) says that, on the outskirts of St. Paul, “a redhead\r\nspent most of October putting acorns into cracks and climbing-iron\r\nholes in a telephone pole and under the shingles of a near-by house.\r\nOne crack was closely plugged for a distance of twenty feet. When the\r\nnuts were too large for the cracks they were split and driven in in\r\npieces.”\r\n\r\nGeorge A. Dorsey (1926) tells of an amusing attempt of a young redhead\r\nto fill a hole in a telephone pole:\r\n\r\n     Finally he found a hole to his liking, and, chattering as\r\n     he worked, he drove the acorn in. Imagine my surprise when\r\n     I saw a couple of acorns fall out on the other side of the\r\n     pole! The hole was bored straight through the pole, and\r\n     the Woodpecker was wasting his time by pushing the acorns\r\n     through. He seemed to know that something was wrong, but\r\n     couldn’t quite reason it out. He would chatter agitatedly\r\n     and hitch around the pole to examine the other side of the\r\n     pole, but would finally give it up and go off for another\r\n     acorn. I watched him poke acorns in the hole several times,\r\n     only to have some of the ones he had previously placed\r\n     there fall out on the other side. On the ground under the\r\n     pole was about a double handful of acorns that had fallen\r\n     out.\r\n\r\nE. D. Nauman (1932) saw a house mouse running across a paved street,\r\nbut it had not gone very far when a red-headed woodpecker “darted down\r\nout of the grove and made an attack upon it. The woodpecker struck\r\nthe mouse several hard and vicious blows with its stout bill, rolling\r\nand tossing it over and over. It appeared that a moment more of such\r\ntreatment must have finished the mouse, had not a vehicle approached\r\njust at that instant, threatening to crush both the red-head and its\r\nprey. The bird darted away just in time to save itself, and the mouse,\r\nnot having been struck by the wheels, hurriedly limped to the edge\r\nof the pavement, got over the curb with difficulty, and hid in the\r\ngrass. The red-head flew back immediately to see what had become of its\r\nprospect for dinner, but the mouse was so well hidden that the bird had\r\nto give up the chase.”\r\n\r\nMr. DuBois writes to me that “a red-headed woodpecker was observed\r\nhanging upside down from the small twigs at the end of a branch of a\r\nlarge oak, evidently gleaning insect life of some sort from the twigs.\r\nIt flew to another tree and repeated this method of feeding.”\r\n\r\nLewis O. Shelley tells me that he observed one “feeding on ants in a\r\ndry, harvested oat piece, obtaining the ants by thrusting the bill\r\ninto an ant tunnel entrance and working the bill to form a cone-shaped\r\nopening, up through which the ants emerged at the disturbance, and were\r\nlicked up without the bill being withdrawn from this foodhopper.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Audubon (1842) writes attractively of the behavior of this\r\nwoodpecker:\r\n\r\n     With the exception of the mocking-bird, I know of no\r\n     species so gay and frolicksome. Indeed, their whole life\r\n     is one of pleasure. They find a superabundance of food\r\n     everywhere, as well as the best facilities for raising\r\n     their broods. * * * They do not seem to be much afraid of\r\n     man, although they have scarcely a more dangerous enemy.\r\n     When alighted on a fence-stake by the road, or in a field,\r\n     and one approaches them, they gradually move sidewise out\r\n     of sight, peeping now and then to discover your intention;\r\n     and when you are quite close and opposite, lie still until\r\n     you are past, when they hop to the top of the stake, and\r\n     rattle upon it with their bill, as if to congratulate\r\n     themselves on the success of their cunning. Should you\r\n     approach within arm’s length, which may frequently be done,\r\n     the woodpecker flies to the next stake or the second from\r\n     you, bends his head to peep, and rattles again, as if to\r\n     provoke you to a continuance of what seems to him excellent\r\n     sport. * * *\r\n\r\n     They chase each other on wing in a very amicable manner,\r\n     in long, beautifully curved sweeps, during which the\r\n     remarkable variety of their plumage becomes conspicuous,\r\n     and is highly pleasing to the eye. When passing from one\r\n     tree to another, their flight resembles the motion of a\r\n     great swing, and is performed by a single opening of the\r\n     wings, descending at first, and rising towards the spot\r\n     on which they are going to alight with ease, and in the\r\n     most graceful manner. They move upwards, sidewise, or\r\n     backwards, without apparent effort, but seldom with the\r\n     head downwards. * * *\r\n\r\n     On the ground, this species is by no means awkward, as it\r\n     hops there with ease, and secures beetles which it had\r\n     espied whilst on the fence or a tree.\r\n\r\nRed-headed woodpeckers are quite quarrelsome at times with other\r\nspecies; besides attacking various small birds, driving them away from\r\ntheir nests, or robbing them of their eggs or young, they contend\r\nwith other hole-nesting birds, such as starlings and the smaller\r\nwoodpeckers, for the possession of nesting holes. They are jealous of\r\ntheir food supply and will drive other birds away from their favorite\r\nfeeding places or from any choice morsel of food. They are generally\r\nthe winners in such encounters, even against such aggressive rivals as\r\nblue jays and starlings. But toward birds of their own species they\r\nare often solicitous, friendly, and helpful to birds in trouble. Mr.\r\nDuBois writes to me: “A wounded female, after several attempts to fly,\r\nfluttered to the ground; and while she was fluttering in the air, her\r\nmate flew to her and apparently tried to help her to a place of safety.\r\nAfter reaching the ground, the female lay still in the grass, although\r\nonly winged; but her mate clung to a nearby tree, from which he flew\r\ndown to her repeatedly, showing great distress.”\r\n\r\nH. M. Holland (1931) tells the following story:\r\n\r\n     A red-head was caught by one wing, and possibly a foot,\r\n     in a crack formed at the tip of a tall, dead tree where\r\n     the trunk had been broken off and left a splintered stub.\r\n     Perhaps a dozen red-heads were present, all flying here\r\n     and there, evidently much excited, and make a great ado, a\r\n     veritable woodpecker hubbub.\r\n\r\n     First one and then another would alight just below and\r\n     apparently peck at, or more often while in flight would\r\n     strike or brush against the hapless victim, whose struggles\r\n     were renewed at each encounter. The clamor became actually\r\n     distressing. At times two or three were simultaneously\r\n     fluttering close to the captive. These activities continued\r\n     for several minutes when suddenly the bird was freed, to\r\n     accomplish which it would seem that a concerted effort\r\n     had been made. Quiet was restored almost at once and the\r\n     participants dispersed.\r\n\r\nJulian K. Potter (1912) noticed that sparrows bothered his woodpeckers\r\nconsiderably about their roosting holes and saw one of them fighting\r\ntwo starlings for the possession of a cavity, but all were eventually\r\ndriven away and learned the lesson of “no trespass.” He says: “On one\r\noccasion, when I watched the woodpeckers until dark, I found that one\r\nwent to roost in the nesting-hole about dusk, and the other, probably\r\nthe male, shortly after went into an old hole in the same dead tree\r\nhigher up.”\r\n\r\nMrs. John Franklin Kyler (1927) gives an interesting account of a\r\nred-headed woodpecker that she raised by hand from the nest, beginning\r\nbefore the young bird had opened its eyes; it developed into a very\r\nsatisfactory pet, with marked affection for its foster mother; anyone\r\nwho wants to try raising young birds could learn much by reading her\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Bendire (1895) writes: “Its ordinary call note is a loud\r\n‘tchur-tchur’; when chasing each other a shrill note like ‘chärr-chärr’\r\nis frequently uttered, and alarm is expressed by a harsh, rattling\r\nnote, as well as by one which, according to Mr. Otto Widmann, is\r\nindistinguishable from the note of the Tree-frog (_Hyla arborea_). He\r\ntells me that both bird and frog sometimes answer each other.”\r\n\r\nDescribing their spring notes, W. L. Dawson (1903) says:\r\n\r\n     Then the woods and groves soon resound with their loud\r\n     calls, _Quee-o--quee-o--queer_. These _queer_ cries are not\r\n     unpleasant, but the birds are a noisy lot at best. When one\r\n     of them flies into a tree where others are gathered, all\r\n     set up an outcry of _yarrow, yarrow, yarrow_, which does\r\n     not subside until the newcomer has had time to shake hands\r\n     all around at least twice. Besides these more familiar\r\n     sounds the red-heads boast an unfathomed repertory of\r\n     chirping, cackling, and raucous noises. The youngsters,\r\n     especially,--awkward, saucy fellows that most of them\r\n     are--sometimes get together and raise a fearful racket\r\n     until some of the older ones, out-stentored, interpose.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The red-headed woodpecker is so conspicuously marked\r\nthat it hardly could be mistaken for anything else. The large white\r\nareas in the wings and on the rump are much in evidence, in any\r\nplumage, especially in flight. The bright red of the entire head and\r\nneck and the plain white breast of the adult are also very conspicuous.\r\n\r\n_Enemies._--The red-headed woodpecker has some bad habits, which have\r\nat times caused considerable damage to property, arousing the enmity\r\nof those who have suffered from its depredations and resulting in the\r\ndestruction of large numbers of these birds. Raids on cultivated fruits\r\nhave given these woodpeckers a bad name and many have been killed by\r\nfruit growers. Audubon (1842) asserts that as many as “a hundred have\r\nbeen shot upon a single cherry tree in one day. Pears, peaches, apples,\r\nfigs, mulberries, and even peas, are thus attacked.”\r\n\r\nThey do considerable damage to pole lines by excavating their nests in\r\nthem. An editorial in The Osprey (vol. 1, p. 147) quotes, as follows,\r\nfrom an article in the Kansas City Star:\r\n\r\n     The little red-headed woodpecker has become such a nuisance\r\n     on the electric lines of the metropolitan street railway\r\n     system, that it has become necessary to appoint an official\r\n     woodpecker exterminator. The title has been conferred on\r\n     Coffee Rice, an Independence young man, and yesterday\r\n     he killed nineteen of the destructive birds on the\r\n     Independence line. The woodpeckers attack the large poles\r\n     which hold up the feed cables and dig holes into the center\r\n     and downward to a depth of more than a foot. * * * The\r\n     result is that in a season the water gets into the heart of\r\n     the pole and it rots off and breaks, requiring a new pole\r\n     to be set up; whereas, ordinarily, the life of the big pole\r\n     is several years. A large number of the electric line poles\r\n     have been ruined this way, and there was a threatened loss\r\n     of many thousand dollars unless the pest was checked.\r\n\r\nRed-headed woodpeckers seem to be oftener killed on highways by\r\nspeeding automobiles than any other species, as attested by several\r\nobservers. Dr. Dayton Stoner (1932) made some observations on this\r\npoint on an automobile trip, on July 15, 1924, for a distance of 211\r\nmiles on well-graveled roads in Iowa. He says:\r\n\r\n     En route, 105 dead animals representing fifteen species\r\n     were counted; of these, thirty-nine were red-headed\r\n     woodpeckers. The mortality in this species was higher than\r\n     for any other species of vertebrate animal noted and I\r\n     believe that several contributory factors are responsible\r\n     for it. First, these birds have a propensity for feeding\r\n     upon insects and waste grain in and along the roads;\r\n     second, they delay taking wing before the approaching car,\r\n     in all probability being poor judges of its speed; and\r\n     third, they have a slow “get-away,” that is, they can not\r\n     quickly gain sufficient speed to escape the oncoming car.\r\n     However, I feel certain that a speed as high as thirty-five\r\n     to forty miles an hour is necessary in order to overtake\r\n     these birds.\r\n\r\nAlexander Wilson (1832) writes:\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding the care which this bird, in common with\r\n     the rest of its genus, takes to place its young beyond the\r\n     reach of enemies, within the hollows of trees, yet there\r\n     is one deadly foe, against whose depredations neither\r\n     the height of the tree nor the depth of the cavity, is\r\n     the least security. This is the black snake (_Coluber\r\n     constrictor_), who frequently glides up the trunk of the\r\n     tree, and, like a skulking savage, enters the woodpecker’s\r\n     peaceful apartment, devours the eggs or helpless young, in\r\n     spite of the cries and fluttering of the parents; and, if\r\n     the place be large enough, coils himself up in the spot\r\n     they occupied, where he will sometimes remain for several\r\n     days.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--The fall migration is often well marked. A. H. Helme (1882),\r\nwriting from Millers Place, Long Island, N. Y., where the bird occurs\r\nmainly as a migrant, says:\r\n\r\n     The first one observed this season was on the 10th of\r\n     September. On the 12th I saw three, and on the 20th I saw\r\n     one. Early on the morning of the 24th of September they\r\n     began to pass over in large numbers, and continued to pass\r\n     until about 10 o’clock, after which very few were seen,\r\n     except straggling groups of three or four, and occasionally\r\n     a single one was seen to pass over during the day. The\r\n     flight must have consisted of several hundred, principally\r\n     young birds. They came from the east and were flying west.\r\n     Many of them in their flight would alight for a few minutes\r\n     in the orchards and corn fields to feed on the half-ripened\r\n     corn, or search among the apple trees for the larva or eggs\r\n     of insects but would soon continue on their journey, and\r\n     their places would be supplied by others. I noticed one\r\n     or two to dart out and seize an insect in the manner of a\r\n     flycatcher. The following day but two or three were seen. A\r\n     few stragglers, however, were occasionally met with up to\r\n     the 10th of October, and one was seen as late as the 23rd\r\n     of November.\r\n\r\nJohn B. Semple (1930) writes:\r\n\r\n     On September 16, 1929, a flight of red-headed woodpeckers\r\n     (_Melanerpes erythrocephalus_) was observed passing over\r\n     the marshes at the head of Sandusky Bay, Ohio. The birds\r\n     were flying in little groups of two to five against a\r\n     stiff southwest wind heading nearly south and at an\r\n     elevation of sixty to eighty yards. Rather more than half\r\n     of them were immature birds but the old and young were not\r\n     segregated. I was hunting ducks at the time and counted\r\n     forty-eight woodpeckers passing in a little more than two\r\n     hours. They apparently came from Ontario and probably\r\n     crossed Lake Erie by way of Point Pelee and Bass Island\r\n     which would make the flight over water only about nine\r\n     miles. It was interesting to note that each successive\r\n     group of birds followed exactly the same route over the\r\n     marshes although those that had gone before were well out\r\n     of sight.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--The red-headed woodpecker is generally considered to be\r\na migratory species throughout the northern portion of its breeding\r\nrange, but its movements seem to depend almost entirely on the\r\nabundance or scarcity of its winter food supply, mainly acorns and\r\nbeechnuts; when these nuts are available in considerable quantities,\r\nthis woodpecker is to be found in reasonable numbers within its summer\r\nrange in the northern States. When Dr. C. Hart Merriam (1878) referred\r\nto it as remaining occasionally in northern New York, Lewis County, in\r\nwinter, some of his ornithological friends were skeptical. He says:\r\n\r\n     I therefore wrote to my friend, Mr. C. L. Bagg, asking\r\n     him to send me a lot of red-headed woodpeckers as soon as\r\n     possible, and in a week’s time received a box containing\r\n     over twenty specimens,--all killed in Lewis County and when\r\n     the snow was three feet deep! This was proof positive.\r\n     Notes kept by Mr. Bagg and myself during the past six\r\n     years show that they were abundant here during the winters\r\n     1871-72, 1873-74, 1875-76, and 1877-78; while they were\r\n     rare or did not occur at all during the winters of 1872-73\r\n     and 1876-77. Their absence was in no way governed by the\r\n     severity of the winters, but entirely dependent upon the\r\n     absence of the usual supply of beechnuts. While the greater\r\n     portion of nuts fall to the ground and are buried beneath\r\n     the snow far beyond the reach of the woodpeckers, yet\r\n     enough remain on the trees all winter to furnish abundant\r\n     subsistence for those species which feed on them. * * *\r\n\r\n     During the autumn the scattered pairs for several miles\r\n     around usually congregate in some suitable wood, containing\r\n     a plenty of beech-trees, and here spend the long cold\r\n     winter in company, chattering and chasing one another about\r\n     among the trees to keep warm, and to help while away the\r\n     time. “Coe’s woods,” in this immediate vicinity, has long\r\n     been famous as the great winter resort for the red-headed\r\n     woodpeckers of the neighborhood, and it is certainly the\r\n     most suitable place for their purposes to be found for many\r\n     miles around. This piece of woods, not over an eighth of\r\n     a mile in extent, contains, besides hundreds of beeches\r\n     (_Fagus ferruginea_), a large number of elms (_Ulmus\r\n     americana_), and white ash-trees (_Fraxinus americana_) of\r\n     great size, most of the tops of which are now dead. What\r\n     more favorable location than this woods could a woodpecker\r\n     desire? Here they have beechnuts in abundance and a\r\n     bountiful supply of dead limbs and tree-tops far above the\r\n     reach of the small charges commonly used by bird-collectors.\r\n\r\nJames B. Purdy (1900) says that “the presence of the Red-headed\r\nWoodpecker (_Melanerpes erythrocephalus_) during the winter months in\r\nMichigan does not depend upon the temperature, but entirely upon the\r\nfood supply, viz.: the crop of acorns and beechnuts which precedes the\r\nwinter. If these nuts are plenty, the red-headed woodpeckers will\r\nalways be found during the winter months, but in no great abundance. If\r\nthere are no acorns or beechnuts, this bird will be entirely absent in\r\nour Michigan forests.”\r\n\r\nRobert Ridgway (1881) writes:\r\n\r\n     Ordinarily this species (_Melanerpes erythrocephalus_)\r\n     is decidedly the most numerous of the Woodpeckers in\r\n     Southeastern Illinois, while during the winter season it is\r\n     often so excessively common in the sheltered bottom-lands\r\n     as to outnumber all other species together, and, in fact,\r\n     is voted a decided nuisance by the hunter, sportsman,\r\n     or collector, on account of its well known habit of\r\n     following any one carrying a gun, and annoying him by its\r\n     continued chatter; at intervals sweeping before him and\r\n     thus diverting attention. Being at this season always\r\n     semi-gregarious, while they are of all woodpeckers the most\r\n     restless and sportive, the annoyance which they thus cause\r\n     is really no trifling matter.\r\n\r\nEvidently, they do not always spend the winter even here, for he says:\r\n“In the early part of October, 1879, I paid my usual yearly visit to my\r\nold home, and scarcely had arrived at the house ere my father informed\r\nme, as a bit of news which he was well aware would both interest and\r\nsurprise me, that the red-headed woodpeckers had all migrated; that for\r\na number of nights preceding he had heard overhead their well-known\r\nnotes as they winged their way to some more or less distant region; in\r\nshort, that the woods that had been their home ‘knew them now no more.’”\r\n\r\nEven as far south as South Carolina, according to Arthur T. Wayne\r\n(1910): “The controlling influence upon the migration of this species\r\nin winter is the presence or absence of acorns of the live and water\r\noaks. If the crop of acorns is large, this woodpecker is abundant\r\nduring the winter months, but if there are no acorns, the bird is\r\nentirely absent, no matter whether the season is mild or severe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Southern Canada and the United States east of the Rocky\r\nMountains; irregularly migratory in the northern parts of its range.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The breeding range of the red-headed woodpecker\r\nextends =north= to northern Montana (Strabane, Lewistown, Fairview,\r\nand Terry); northern North Dakota (Arnegard and Willow City); southern\r\nManitoba (Lake St. Martin and Winnipeg); southern Ontario (Kenora,\r\nCobden, and Ottawa); southern Quebec (Three Rivers and Hatley); and\r\nsouthern New Brunswick (St. John). The =eastern= limits of the range\r\nextend from New Brunswick (St. John) south along the Atlantic coast\r\nto Florida (Orlando and Fort Myers). =South= through the Gulf coastal\r\nregions of Florida, Mississippi, and Louisiana; central Texas (Waco);\r\nand central New Mexico (Fort Sumner and Albuquerque). =West= to New\r\nMexico (Albuquerque and Santa Fe); central Colorado (Hotchkiss,\r\nGolden, Estes Park, and Fort Collins); eastern Wyoming (Laramie and\r\nCarey burst); and Montana (Kirby, Billings, Lewistown, and Strabane).\r\n\r\nDuring the summer season the species also has been taken or observed\r\nnorth to southeastern Alberta (Medicine Hat, Big Stick, and Eastend);\r\nsouthern Saskatchewan (Oak Lake, Aweme, and Pilot mound); Quebec\r\n(Quebec City); and New Brunswick (Beaver Dam).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The normal winter range of the red-headed woodpecker\r\nappears to extend =north= to Oklahoma (Oklahoma City and Okmulgee);\r\nnortheastern Iowa (National); Illinois (Ohio and Mount Carmel);\r\nTennessee (Nashville and Knoxville); West Virginia (Charlestown and\r\nClarksburg); and southeastern Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). At this\r\nseason it is never common on the Atlantic coast north of South Carolina\r\n(Charleston), but is found from there =south= to southern Florida\r\n(Miami). From this point it winters westward along the Gulf coast to\r\nLouisiana and probably Texas. The =western= limits of the winter range\r\nappear to be central Texas (probably Somerset) and Oklahoma (Caddo and\r\nOklahoma City).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the winter range above given, it also has been noted\r\ncasually at this season in eastern Kansas and Nebraska, southeastern\r\nSouth Dakota (Yankton, January 2, 1929, and the winter of 1936-37);\r\nNorth Dakota (Grafton, specimen collected January 24, 1905); Minnesota\r\n(frequent in the southern part); Wisconsin (occasional north to\r\nMeriden and New London); southern Michigan (Grand Rapids, Lansing,\r\nand Detroit); southern Ontario (Coldstream, Toronto, and Kingston);\r\nsouthern Vermont (Bennington); and Massachusetts (Boston).\r\n\r\n_Migration._--The migrations of the red-headed woodpecker are\r\nimperfectly understood, and, as will be noted from the numerous casual\r\nwinter records, individuals of this species sometimes winter north\r\nalmost to the limits of the breeding range. This makes difficult the\r\ndesignation of early and late dates of migration. Nevertheless, the\r\nfollowing dates may be considered representative of most seasons in\r\nthat portion of the range where the species is normally migratory:\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--Early dates of arrival are: New Jersey--Elizabeth,\r\nFebruary 27; New Providence, March 13; Cape May, March 27.

Montana--Albion, May 19; Fort\r\nCuster, May 20.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--Late dates of fall departure are: Montana--Sun\r\nRiver, September 5. Wyoming--Laramie, September 4; Wheatland,\r\nSeptember 6; Panco, October 2. Colorado--Greeley, October 1; Denver;,\r\nOctober 21; Boulder County, October 23.

Massachusetts--Springfield, October\r\n9; Boston, October 15. Connecticut--Fairfield, October 8; Hartford,\r\nOctober 13. Northern New York--Watertown, October 16; Geneva, October\r\n24; Rochester, November 11. Northwestern Pennsylvania--McKeesport,\r\nOctober 19; Berwyn, November 8; Erie, November 17. New Jersey--Passaic,\r\nOctober 21; Cape May, October 21; Morristown, November 2.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the banding files in the Biological Survey adds\r\nbut little information to knowledge of the migrations of this bird.\r\nAlthough it has been banded in fair numbers (more than 1,700 previous\r\nto July 1, 1937) the farthest recovery record is only about 80 miles\r\nsouth of the point of banding. There are, however, several cases of\r\nreturn in subsequent seasons to the banding stations.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--Records of this species outside its normal range are\r\nnot numerous. A single specimen was taken in the Chiricahua Mountains,\r\nAriz., in the spring of 1894; one was observed in Salt Lake City, Utah,\r\nin June 1874; and one was noted near Fortine, in northwestern Montana,\r\non June 18, 1931.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--Alabama: 12 records, April 20 to July 15; 6 records,\r\n    May 26 to June 17, indicating the height of the season.\r\n  Illinois: 19 records, May 9 to July 10; 10 records, May 19 to June 15.\r\n  Michigan: 16 records, May 9 to August 20; 8 records, May 15 to June 3.\r\n  New York: 15 records, May 21 to June 19; 8 records, May 26 to June 5.\r\n  South Carolina: 12 records, May 6 to July 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            BALANOSPHYRA FORMICIVORA FORMICIVORA (Swainson)\r\n\r\n                         ANT-EATING WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe type race of the species is now restricted in its distribution\r\nto the region from south-central Texas (Kerr County and the Chisos\r\nMountains) to eastern and southern Mexico. It differs from the other\r\nraces in the width of the white frontal band, the amount of streaking\r\non the breast and sides, and the amount of yellow in the throat patch,\r\nas well as in size. It differs from _bairdi_ and _aculeata_ in having\r\nthe chest mostly streaked, at least on the median portion, instead\r\nof mostly uniform black. The white frontal patch is broader than in\r\n_angustifrons_, and the black band across the female crown is much\r\nwider. It is slightly larger than _aculeata_, and somewhat smaller than\r\n_bairdi_ but decidedly larger than _angustifrons_. Its throat patch is\r\npaler yellow than in _bairdi_ and _angustifrons_.\r\n\r\nI cannot find anything of consequence in print relating to the habits\r\nof the race, which probably do not differ materially from the habits\r\nof the species elsewhere. There are two sets of eggs in the Thayer\r\ncollection, one of six and one of five eggs, taken in Tamaulipas,\r\nMexico, on April 18 and 22, 1908; in each case the nest is said to\r\nhave been 20 feet from the ground in a pine. The measurements of these\r\n11 eggs average 26.47 by 19.00 millimeters; the eggs showing the four\r\nextremes measure =28.1= by 19.0, 26.7 by =19.3=, =25.9= by =18.9=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Western United States, Central America, and northwestern\r\nSouth America; nonmigratory.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific coast the ant-eating woodpecker ranges through the\r\nCoast and Sierra Nevada ranges =north= to southwestern Oregon (Cow\r\nCreek and Ashland). In the interior it is found =north= to northern\r\nArizona (Hualapai Mountain, Williams, and Grand Canyon); northern New\r\nMexico (Largo Canyon and the headwaters of the Gallina River); and\r\nsouthwestern Texas (Fort Davis and Kerrville). From these regions\r\nthe species is found =south= through both eastern and western Mexico\r\n(including Baja California) and other Central American countries, at\r\nleast to central Colombia.\r\n\r\nSeveral subspecies of this woodpecker are found only in Central and\r\nSouth America, but three varieties occur regularly in the United\r\nStates, while two others are confined to Baja California. The true\r\nant-eating woodpecker (_B. f. formicivora_), which ranges through\r\neastern and southern Mexico, is found also in south-central Texas\r\n(Chisos Mountains and Kerrville). Mearns’s woodpecker (_B. f.\r\naculeata_) occupies the range in Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas\r\n(Fort Davis) south through the Mexican States of Sonora, Chihuahua, and\r\nDurango. The California woodpecker (_B. f. bairdi_) is found in the\r\nPacific coast region from Oregon south to northern Baja California. In\r\nthis Mexican State the narrow-fronted woodpecker (_B. f. angustifrons_)\r\nis confined to the region of Cape San Lucas, while the San Pedro\r\nwoodpecker (_B. f. martirensis_) is found in the northwestern part of\r\nthe area nearly to the United States border.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--Arizona: 9 records, May 10 to June 10.\r\n  California: 66 records, April 2 to June 15; 33 records, April 20 to\r\n    May 15, indicating the height of the season. Second and third\r\n    broods have been found in September and October.\r\n  Baja California: 4 records, May 10 to June 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               BALANOSPHYRA FORMICIVORA BAIRDI (Ridgway)\r\n\r\n                         CALIFORNIA WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                               PLATE 28\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe above common name is well chosen, as this is one of the commonest\r\nand most conspicuous birds throughout its range in California. Anyone\r\nwho spends much time afield in the valleys, foothills, and canyons of\r\nsouthern and western California is sure to see this strikingly colored\r\nand active woodpecker making itself conspicuous among the oaks and\r\npines; and, where one is seen, there are almost sure to be others, for\r\nit is a sociable species.\r\n\r\nReferring to the Lassen Peak region, Grinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale\r\n(1930) say:\r\n\r\n     Two environmental factors of seeming importance for the\r\n     presence of this bird were an available supply of acorns\r\n     and wood or bark of sorts into which the birds could bore\r\n     storage holes. As to species of oak, out of the six or\r\n     more present, our impression remains that no outstanding\r\n     choice by the woodpeckers was shown. About as many of the\r\n     birds were seen among the black oaks in the vicinity of\r\n     Payne Creek P. O., as among the valley oaks around Cone’s.\r\n     However, tracks of black oaks recurred east of the main\r\n     mountain mass in the section, as along the upper Susan\r\n     River and near Eagle Lake, where no California woodpeckers\r\n     were ever seen by us. To repeat, none of this species of\r\n     woodpecker was seen by us east of about the western edge of\r\n     the yellow pine belt (Transition life-zone). * * *\r\n\r\n     Situations where individuals of this woodpecker were\r\n     observed are as follows: top of sycamore; dead sycamore\r\n     stub; in cottonwood; about clumps of fruiting mistletoe; at\r\n     tips of twigs of large valley oak; in black oak; in blue\r\n     oak; on dead upper limb of living blue oak; in orchard\r\n     tree; on isolated digger pine; in large yellow pine; at\r\n     top of dead incense cedar; on ground at roadside; on fence\r\n     post; on barn end; on telephone pole.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--I first became acquainted with this handsome woodpecker\r\nin the Arroyo Seco, on the outskirts of Pasadena, during the winter and\r\nspring of 1929, where I often saw these birds busy with their courtship\r\nactivities in the tops of the tall sycamores. They were flying about\r\namong the treetops, making a lot of noise, two males sometimes chasing\r\na female and showing off their brilliant colors, the white spaces in\r\ntheir wings and the white rumps being especially conspicuous; doubtless\r\nthe red crown and yellow throat, set off by black and white, played an\r\nimportant part in the display. They reminded me of flickers, as they\r\ndanced on, or dodged around, the branches in playful, showy antics.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--_Bendire_ (1895) writes:\r\n\r\n     In the more southern portions of its range nidification\r\n     commences sometimes as early as April, and somewhat later\r\n     farther north. The nesting sites are mostly excavated in\r\n     white-oak trees, both living and dead, but preferably\r\n     one of the former is selected in which the core of the\r\n     tree is decayed. It also nests occasionally in sycamores,\r\n     cottonwoods, and large willow trees, and more rarely in\r\n     telegraph poles. Both sexes assist in the excavation of\r\n     the nesting site, as well as in incubation. The entrance\r\n     hole is about 1⅗ inches in diameter, perfectly circular,\r\n     and is sometimes chiseled through 2 or 3 inches of solid\r\n     wood before the softer and decayed core is reached. The\r\n     inner cavity is gradually enlarged as it descends, and\r\n     varies from 8 to 24 inches in depth, usually being from 4\r\n     to 5 inches in diameter at the bottom, where a quantity of\r\n     fine chips are allowed to remain, on which the eggs are\r\n     deposited.\r\n\r\nMilton P. Skinner writes to me: “On May 12, 1933, I found a nest in the\r\nmain trunk of an almost dead black oak. The opening, 25 feet above the\r\nground, seemed very small and was placed on the southeast side of the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n“In the Yosemite Valley, these birds nest in the trunks and large limbs\r\nof the Kellogg oaks, and their abandoned holes may be used by pygmy\r\nowls another year. As a rule, the California woodpeckers and the pygmy\r\nowls show little antagonism toward each other. In spite of this usual\r\ncustom of nesting in the oaks, most of the birds I saw in the Yosemite\r\nwere actually in the cottonwoods along the river. After some searching,\r\nI found at least one nest there in a short, dead stub of a cottonwood,\r\non July 24, 1933. I saw one bird fly down and feed another that was\r\ninside, and then fly away. The hole was about 12 feet above the ground\r\nand on the north side of the stub, facing the river and away from the\r\nmeadow behind it. All the trees in the vicinity were cottonwoods, but\r\nthere was one oak 150 feet east of the nesting site. There were six\r\nother holes in the stub, all on the north side and from 6 to 18 feet\r\nabove the ground.”\r\n\r\nGrinnell and Storer (1924) write:\r\n\r\n     The more intensive occupancy of the Yosemite Valley\r\n     during recent years and the operations of the government\r\n     employees in promptly removing dead but standing trees\r\n     to be cut up for wood has operated to the detriment of\r\n     the woodpeckers which seek such trees for nesting holes.\r\n     So it was no surprise, in May, 1919, to find a number of\r\n     telephone or electric power poles near Redwood Lane which\r\n     had been prospected for nesting sites by woodpeckers--the\r\n     California, to judge from the size of hole and general\r\n     location. Dearth of suitable natural sites had forced the\r\n     birds to at least investigate these newly established\r\n     dead-tree substitutes. With no substitutes at all\r\n     available, the only result to be logically looked for,\r\n     as a result of man’s interference with the natural order\r\n     of affairs, would be the disappearance of woodpeckers.\r\n     The question arises here as to the justification of the\r\n     administratiton in so altering natural conditions in\r\n     National Parks as to threaten the persistence there of any\r\n     of its native denizens.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The California woodpecker lays ordinarily four or five\r\neggs; six eggs are not very rare; and as many as ten have been found\r\nin a nest, probably the product of two females. The eggs vary from\r\nshort-ovate to elliptical-ovate. They are pure white, with very little\r\nor no gloss. The measurements of 52 eggs average 25.98 by 19.78\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =29.9= by 19.0,\r\n27.9 by =22.6=, =22.0= by 18.6, and 24.38 by =18.29= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation is said to be about 14 days, in\r\nwhich both parents assist. Both also help to feed the young. Harriet\r\nWilliams Myers (1915) made some interesting observations on a late\r\nbrood of young California woodpeckers, which she found in a hole in a\r\ntelephone pole, on September 11, between Los Angeles and Pasadena. She\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     In an hour’s watching the birds fed 28 times, the shortest\r\n     interval being one-half minute, the longest eight. In nine\r\n     minutes they fed eight times.\r\n\r\n     On the 15th of the month, when I believe the young must\r\n     have been about ten days old, they were fed 24 times in 58\r\n     minutes. The food given them now was mostly acorns which\r\n     the adults took from the nearby poles, sometimes digging\r\n     them out in pieces, and sometimes taking them to the top of\r\n     a flat pole where they pounded away for some minutes before\r\n     coming to the nest with their bills stuffed full of the\r\n     white bits. From this time until the young left the nest\r\n     they were fed mostly on these acorns.\r\n\r\nOne of her most interesting observations was that an apparently young\r\nbird, presumably a fully grown member of an earlier brood, joined the\r\ntwo parents that were feeding the young in the nest. At one time, this\r\nimmature bird entered the nest, while the parents were away, apparently\r\nfor the purpose of being fed by them, and remained there for some time.\r\nMeanwhile--\r\n\r\n     when the adults came to feed they did not go inside but\r\n     reached over, fed, and flew away. Three times one of them\r\n     did this, but the fourth time, when the male came, he\r\n     stood on one side of the hole and I heard him give low,\r\n     guttural notes. * * * Presently, the truant young, for such\r\n     he proved to be, appeared in the doorway and, with open\r\n     mouth, begged for just one bite. * * * But the old bird was\r\n     unrelenting and stayed in his position by the hole until\r\n     the bird inside, which was undoubtedly a former nestling,\r\n     came out and flew onto the wire above, when the adult male\r\n     went within.\r\n\r\n     Just to prove that he was not all baby, the former nestling\r\n     turned in and helped feed. Several times he went into\r\n     the hole and came directly out, and I might have thought\r\n     that he was in there in hopes of getting fed had I not\r\n     distinctly seen a big fly in his bill as he entered. Each\r\n     time as he bobbed into the hole several white bars showed\r\n     plainly on the underside of the outer tail feathers. It was\r\n     this marking of a young bird which convinced me that he was\r\n     a former nestling. In every other respect he resembled a\r\n     male California Woodpecker. Once more, during my watching,\r\n     he slipped into the nest, staying eight minutes before they\r\n     got him out. The first time it had been twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nFrom the above, and from the observations of Frank A. Leach (1925), to\r\nbe referred to later, it seems that the California woodpecker often, if\r\nnot regularly, raises two or even three broods in a season.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The young are hatched naked and blind, but the juvenal\r\nplumage is acquired before the young bird leaves the nest. In this\r\nplumage the young male closely resembles the adult male and the young\r\nfemale is much like the adult female in general color pattern, but the\r\nred of the crown and nape is duller and more or less mixed with dusky\r\nor black; sometimes the crown is nearly all black mixed with some\r\nscarlet feathers; the colors everywhere are duller, lacking in gloss,\r\nand the plumage is softer, less firm; the yellow of the throat is less\r\npronounced; the streaks on the breast are less sharply defined; the\r\ntertials and scapulars are tipped with white, and there are narrow\r\nwhite tips on the two outer tail feathers on each side, but these\r\ntips wear away during winter, or sooner; there are at least two white\r\nspots on each web of the outer tail feather, which are in evidence all\r\nthrough the first year; as the juvenal wings and tail are retained\r\nuntil the next summer molt, birds of the year may be thus recognized;\r\nthe bill is smaller and weaker than that of the adult. The molt of the\r\njuvenal contour plumage begins in August or September.\r\n\r\nAdults have a complete annual molt between July and September, mainly\r\nin August.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Some prominent California ornithologists have named this bird\r\nthe “California acorn-storing woodpecker,” a rather long but very\r\nappropriate name, for it designates one of its most characteristic\r\nhabits and names the largest item in its food supply. W. L. Dawson\r\n(1923) has this to say on the subject:\r\n\r\n     From time immemorial this bird has riddled the bark of\r\n     certain forest trees and stuffed the holes with acorns.\r\n     Speculation is still rife as to the cause or occasion or\r\n     necessity or purpose of this strange practice, but the fact\r\n     is indisputable and the evidence of it widely diffused. * * *\r\n\r\n     What he accomplishes the photographs show well enough,--the\r\n     close, methodical studding of bark or wood of any kind with\r\n     acorns, chiefly those of live-oaks, over immense areas.\r\n     The cultures, once started, are wrought upon continuously\r\n     year by year, as material avails or the colony flourishes.\r\n     Live-oaks themselves are the commonest hosts, together\r\n     with the white, or post, oak, and the black oak of the\r\n     southern counties. After these come sycamore and yellow\r\n     pine or, more rarely, eucalyptus. Telegraph and telephone\r\n     poles, gables, cornices, and, in fact, any wooden structure\r\n     where they are permitted to work, if near the source of\r\n     acorn supply, may come in for ornamentation. On a small\r\n     square-sawed telephone pole near Marysville I found sixty\r\n     acorns (and pecans purloined from a neighboring orchard)\r\n     imbedded in a space five inches wide and two feet long.\r\n     At that rate the pole carried some 1500 of these tiny\r\n     storehouses.\r\n\r\n     In Tecolote Canyon, west of Santa Barbara, there is a giant\r\n     sycamore which I count one of the handsomest examples of\r\n     Carpintero’s workmanship--an unbroken shaft, at least\r\n     forty feet high and three feet across the inlaid face,\r\n     covered with a “solid” mass of acorns totalling, say, some\r\n     20,000. Strawberry Valley in the San Jacinto Mountains\r\n     appears to be a paradise for the California Woodpecker.\r\n     Here majestic oaks (_Quercus californica_) alternate\r\n     with still more majestic pines (_Pinus ponderosa_), the\r\n     former for sustenance and the latter for storage, and the\r\n     doughty “California” is probably the most abundant bird\r\n     in the valley. The boles of the most enormous pines are\r\n     methodically riddled with their acorn-carrying niches, and\r\n     in some of the trees the work is carried through from base\r\n     to crown. In one such tree I estimated that there were\r\n     imbedded no less than 50,000 acorns.\r\n\r\nDr. William E. Ritter has made an intensive study of this interesting\r\nhabit of the California woodpecker and has published the results of\r\nhis observations and theories in three extensive papers (1921, 1922,\r\n1938). There is much food for thought in these scholarly papers, to\r\nwhich the reader is referred, but space here will permit only brief\r\nquotations from or references to them. As to whether the hole drilling\r\nis injurious to the trees, he says (1921): “Although I have examined\r\nmany storage pines in widely separated localities, I have never seen\r\nanything even suggestive of harm to the trees from the holes. Never,\r\nso far as I have noticed, do the holes pierce through into the deeper\r\nliving layers of the bark.” He noticed that “almost without exception\r\nthe nuts were inserted tip in and base out, most of them fitting the\r\nhole snugly,” having been driven in good and hard, and flush with\r\nthe surface of the bark, or even countersunken below it; and that\r\n“to a certain extent the store holes are made to fit the size of the\r\nacorns they are to receive”; this latter point was discovered when\r\nhe noted that, in a region where the black oak (_Quercus kelloggii_)\r\npredominated, the holes were considerably larger than they were in\r\nthe live-oak region, the acorns of the black oak being sharply larger\r\nthan those of the live oak. In some cases the acorns were not driven\r\nin flush with the bark, the base being left protruding somewhat and\r\nthus leaving them vulnerable to pilfering by rodents and perhaps\r\nsome birds; in this connection, he says: “Conclusive evidence that\r\nnut-eating rodents (squirrels, rats) prey upon the acorns stored by the\r\nwoodpeckers was first obtained on the present visit. Two trees were\r\nfound on which the bark immediately around acorn holes had been gnawed\r\nby rodents, as unmistakably proved by the tooth marks. The acorns were\r\ngone from some of these holes, but not from all, thus showing that the\r\nmarauders had failed in some of their efforts.”\r\n\r\nSummarizing his first paper, he makes the following statements:\r\n\r\n     As to hole drilling: While the holes are made expressly\r\n     for the reception of acorns, many holes are probably made\r\n     which are never used, holes are made at seasons of the year\r\n     when there are no acorns to store, and large numbers of\r\n     perfectly serviceable holes seem to be abandoned even in\r\n     localities where both birds and acorns are abundant, and\r\n     new holes are being made.\r\n\r\n     As to the storing business itself: While this is\r\n     of distinct service to the food necessities of the\r\n     woodpeckers, the instinct sometimes goes wrong to the\r\n     extent of storing pebbles instead of acorns, thus defeating\r\n     entirely the purpose of the instinct. Again, large numbers\r\n     of acorns are sometimes stored, the use of which is so long\r\n     delayed that the acorns become wholly or largely unfit\r\n     for food, and this in places where the bird population\r\n     seems normal. Finally, acorns are sometimes stored in such\r\n     fashion as to make them easy prey for marauding rodents,\r\n     when with some definite foresight and a little more work\r\n     such exposure could easily be largely avoided.\r\n\r\nIn his second paper (1922), after further observations, he states[1]:\r\n\r\n     My previous surmise that the birds are more interested in\r\n     the grubs contained in the acorns than in the acorn meats\r\n     has not been substantiated. What I could make out while\r\n     in camp among them, by watching them gather and eat their\r\n     breakfasts, was to the effect that good uninhabited acorns\r\n     were chiefly used. Again and again birds were seen to pick\r\n     nuts from the top-most branches of the black oak, fly\r\n     with them in their beaks to some approximately horizontal\r\n     surface of a large limb on a pine or another oak, make\r\n     the surface aid them somehow (I never could see exactly\r\n     how, as the “breakfast tables” were, of course, all on the\r\n     upper surfaces of the limbs, and too high for my vision)\r\n     in breaking and tearing open the nuts. Apparently cracks\r\n     and chinks in the table top serve as holders for the acorns\r\n     while they are being opened and eaten. This is indicated\r\n     by the fact that dead and partly decayed trees or parts of\r\n     trees were mostly used. I saw no indication of the feet\r\n     being used in handling the nuts. The litter on the ground\r\n     under the dining trees, consisting of shell fragments\r\n     and lost bits of meat, indicated grubless nuts almost\r\n     entirely. This result as to the use of mast is in agreement\r\n     with Beal’s examination of the stomach contents of our\r\n     woodpecker.\r\n\r\nCharles W. Michael (1926), in the Yosemite Valley, made the interesting\r\ndiscovery that the California woodpecker has been known to learn by\r\nexperience and to show some intelligence in its acorn storing. For a\r\nnumber of years when acorns were abundant no extensive storing was\r\ndone, yet the woodpeckers lived in the valley all winter. Then came a\r\nlean year, with no acorn crop, when no storing _could_ be done; and\r\nthat winter the woodpeckers were forced to leave the valley for lack\r\nof food. The following year there was a bountiful crop of acorns, and\r\nthe woodpeckers, having learned by experience, were busy filling up\r\ntheir storehouses. “From the above observations,” he says, “one might\r\nconclude that an abundance of acorns is not directly responsible for\r\nprodigious storing. In a land of plenty the necessity of laying aside\r\nstores for future consumption is obviated. It is the barren years that\r\nteach the value of thrift. Intelligence plus experience may well have\r\nbeen the cause of the excessive storing of this year. A few of the more\r\nintelligent woodpeckers that were forced last winter to abandon the\r\nvalley for lack of food are now preparing against the next lean year.”\r\n\r\nClaude Gignoux (1921) reports finding almonds stored in the bark of an\r\noak tree on a ranch near Marysville, Calif., as well as in the side of\r\na barn.\r\n\r\nDawson (1923) says: “A regrettable taste for fruit is occasionally\r\ncultivated, but this has not reached economic proportions, save in the\r\ncase of almonds. Almond orchards thrive best at a very considerable\r\ndistance from oak groves.”\r\n\r\nAlthough acorns, almonds, walnuts, and pecans constitute nearly 53\r\npercent of its food, and much more than that in fall and winter, the\r\nCalifornia woodpecker eats quite a variety of other food at different\r\nseasons. Prof. F. E. L. Beal (1910) examined the contents of 75\r\nstomachs, which contained “22.43 percent of animal matter to 77.57\r\npercent of vegetable.” Bendire (1895) says: “During the spring and\r\nsummer its food consists, to a great extent, of insects, including\r\ngrasshoppers, ants, beetles, and different species of flies, varied\r\noccasionally with fruit, such as cherries, which are carried off whole,\r\napples, figs, and also berries and green corn.”\r\n\r\nMr. Skinner says in his notes: “At times this bird feeds very much\r\nlike an eastern red-headed woodpecker. On May 9, 1933, one was seen on\r\nthe trunk of an oak, only 4 feet above ground, making flycatcherlike\r\nsallies up under the foliage of the oak. And many times thereafter I\r\nsaw the birds operating similarly within the foliage itself. In some\r\ninstances I have seen these woodpeckers dart out from high up in tall\r\nyellow pines after passing insects, then gliding back on set wings.\r\nSometimes they do this from tall electric poles, at times going out as\r\nmuch as 50 feet. Since there was every reason to suppose that the bird\r\nsaw the insect before it started, this speaks well for its keenness of\r\neyesight. At times, these woodpeckers glean insects from the bark of\r\ntrees. In July, in the Yosemite Valley, hunting the twigs and bark for\r\ninsects seemed the favorite method of getting food.”\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph Grinnell (1908) saw one of these woodpeckers, in the San\r\nBernardino Mountains, drive a sapsucker away from its borings in an\r\nalder and then go “the rounds of the borings” drinking from each. Dr.\r\nHarold C. Bryant (1921) saw a California woodpecker robbing a nest of\r\na pair of western wood pewees; he was “calmly perched on the pewee’s\r\nnest and eating one of the eggs. I could see the white and the yolk of\r\nthe egg on the woodpecker’s bill, as he raised his head. After watching\r\nfor some time, I attempted to frighten the robber away, but experienced\r\nconsiderable difficulty in doing so. When he finally left the nest the\r\npewees continued to dart at him, to drive him farther away. Soon one of\r\nthe pewees, apparently the female, returned to the nest, picked up an\r\neggshell and flew off with it. I was unable to see what she did with\r\nit. In half a minute she returned and began incubating the remaining\r\neggs.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The California woodpecker flies in true woodpecker\r\nfashion, an undulating flight, interspersed with long dips during which\r\nthe wings are partly closed and somewhat pressed against the sides of\r\nthe body; during the rises the wings are flapped, displaying the black\r\nand white markings conspicuously; there is an upward sweep before\r\nalighting. Grinnell and Storer (1924) say: “When alighting on a tree\r\ntrunk, these birds assume a vertical posture, head out, tail appressed\r\nto the bark. They move up by a hitching process--head in, tail out; up;\r\ntail in, head out. If a bird perches on a small horizontal branch, his\r\nposition is more likely to be diagonal than directly crosswise. If a\r\nbird alights on the square top of a fence post, he seems ill at ease\r\nand soon backs over the edge into a more woodpecker-like posture.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dawson (1923) writes: “A most characteristic flight-movement is an\r\nexaggerated fluttering wherein progress is at a minimum and exercise at\r\na maximum. In this way, also, they ascend at acute angles, sometimes\r\nalmost vertically. With this movement alternates much sailing with\r\noutspread wings, and certain tragic pauses wherein the wings are quite\r\nfolded.” A similar flight is thus described by Grinnell, Dixon, and\r\nLinsdale (1930) as follows: “Individual woodpeckers were often seen\r\nmaking a kind of flight the object of which we did not determine. A\r\nbird would fly in a nearly vertical direction from its perch for three\r\nmeters or more and then commence an irregular swooping flight, finally\r\ncoming back to the original perch.”\r\n\r\nM. P. Skinner says in his notes: “In many of their ways, motions, and\r\nmannerisms these birds strongly resemble the red-headed woodpeckers of\r\nEastern United States. Often they are very quiet and remain motionless\r\nin one position for many minutes at a time. They are as apt to perch\r\ncrosswise as lengthwise of a horizontal, or nearly horizontal, limb.\r\nAt times, they hop along a limb, or the cross-arm of an electric pole,\r\nwhile their bodies are turned a little sideways. Although one exhibited\r\nthe usual woodpecker habit of nervously jumping down backward, and\r\nswaying from side to side, so as to be seen first on one side of his\r\ndead stub and then on the other, he was really noticeably quiet and\r\nmotionless most of the time. One was seen in the Yosemite Valley on the\r\nunder side of a cottonwood twig, clinging there with his back down.”\r\n\r\nBendire (1895), on the other hand, says: “It is one of the most\r\nrestless Woodpeckers I know of, and never appears to be at a loss for\r\namusement or work of some kind, and no other bird belonging to this\r\nfamily could possibly be more industrious.” This was my impression of\r\nit, as well as the opinion of others.\r\n\r\nHenry W. Henshaw (1921) evidently considered this woodpecker playful,\r\nfor he writes: “In searching for the motives underlying the storing\r\nhabit of the California Woodpecker we should not lose sight of the fact\r\nthat the several acts in the process, the boring of the holes, the\r\nsearch for the acorns, the carrying them to the holes and the fitting\r\nthem in, bear no semblance to work in the ordinary sense of the term,\r\nbut is play. I have seen the birds storing acorns many times, and\r\nalways when thus engaged they fill the air with their joyous cries and\r\nconstantly play tag with each other as they fly back and forth. When\r\nthus engaged they might not inaptly be likened to a group of children\r\nat play.”\r\n\r\nCalifornia woodpeckers are well known to be sociable birds and to live\r\nmore or less in communities or loose colonies, where food conditions\r\nare favorable. But a most remarkable story of apparently communal\r\nnesting is told by Frank A. Leach (1925). On February 2, 1922, he\r\ndiscovered these woodpeckers excavating a nest in a wooden trolley\r\npole at Diablo, Calif. He estimated that they must have started work\r\non this hole about the middle of January and thinks that it was some\r\ntime near the latter part of April before it was finished. On March 1,\r\nhe “saw two go in one after the other. Both appeared to be working on\r\nthe inside. Two other birds on the pole showed interest in the work by\r\nremaining there and taking an occasional peep into the hole.” On April\r\n3, there were “from four to six woodpeckers about the place all day. On\r\none occasion saw three go into the hole. Heard digging while they were\r\ninside.” On April 17, he saw “three birds go into the cavity and soon\r\nafter heard two of them working. Four other birds were on the pole, one\r\nlooking into the hole.”\r\n\r\nThe above extracts from his notes, made at frequent intervals and\r\noften for several days in succession, would seem to indicate that\r\nat least two, and possibly three, pairs of woodpeckers assisted\r\nin the excavation of that nest, but evidently their work was not\r\nvery efficient, as the time involved was unusually long. The same\r\ncooperative behavior continued during incubation of the eggs and the\r\nfeeding of the young, several different birds working in relays; and\r\nthis continued during the rearing of three broods of young that season.\r\nHe says that “in the case of the second brood, on eight different\r\noccasions I saw three different old birds feed the young ones in the\r\nnest, and at one time I witnessed a fourth one delivering food to\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nReferring to the third brood, he says:\r\n\r\n     In the large oak tree standing so near the trolley pole\r\n     that some of its outer branches nearly reached the\r\n     pole, there were almost always from six to eight mature\r\n     woodpeckers, all of which seemed to be interested in the\r\n     welfare of the nestlings in the pole. I repeatedly saw\r\n     three of them feed the youngsters, and on two occasions\r\n     noted four different old birds perform this parental\r\n     service. I was satisfied from the actions of the birds that\r\n     a majority of the flock, if not all of them, participated\r\n     in the care of the young woodpeckers. * * *\r\n\r\n     For others than the parent birds to feed the young was a\r\n     custom that was not confined to this group or flock at the\r\n     trolley pole. At about the time the young were leaving\r\n     that nest, I discovered another nest in a large oak tree\r\n     situated about a quarter of a mile distant from the pole,\r\n     where I found from one to five old birds, and possibly\r\n     more, very busy feeding the nestlings.\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) remarks: “The California woodpecker is by far\r\nthe most social representative of this family found within the United\r\nStates, and it is no unusual occurrence to see half a dozen or more in\r\na single tree. It is also a well-disposed bird, and seldom quarrels\r\nor fights with its own kind or with smaller species; but it most\r\nemphatically resents the thieving propensities of the different jays,\r\nmagpies, and squirrels, when caught trespassing on its winter stores,\r\nattacking these intruders with such vigor and persistency that they are\r\ncompelled to vacate the premises in a hurry.”\r\n\r\nAccording to some other observers, its behavior toward other species\r\nis not always as friendly as it might be. M. P. Skinner writes to me:\r\n“Once I found a California woodpecker and a California jay peaceably\r\nperched in the top of a dead cottonwood. But at other times I have\r\nnoted much fighting between these woodpeckers and the jays, with the\r\nwoodpeckers apparently able to hold their own. On May 1, 1933, at old\r\nFort Tejon, I saw a California woodpecker make a vicious dive at a\r\nplain titmouse that was clinging to the bark on the trunk of an oak.\r\nOn May 31 I saw one make a dive at an Arkansas kingbird on a fence\r\nand drive it away. In May 1933 I found a pair of house finches that\r\nhad attempted to nest in a cavity high up in a dead stub of a black\r\noak. When I appeared, I found a California woodpecker throwing out the\r\nstraws and other nest material. The two finches were only a foot or\r\ntwo distant, but they made no attempt to save their home, although it\r\nis probable that they were scolding. Old acorn stores in the same stub\r\nindicated that some woodpecker had an earlier claim to that stub than\r\nthe finches had.”\r\n\r\nHoward W. Wright (1908) says:\r\n\r\n     January 18, while collecting at Newhall, California, I\r\n     wounded a Lewis woodpecker. The bird was able to fly\r\n     to another tree, and I noticed that some California\r\n     woodpeckers in a nearby tree became very much excited. As\r\n     the Lewis woodpecker lit on the tree trunk four California\r\n     woodpeckers attacked him evidently with the intent of\r\n     driving him off. The Lewis started for another tree but a\r\n     California flew at him from in front, and they both fell\r\n     in the struggle that ensued. At this the other California\r\n     woodpeckers, which were joined by a few more, set up a\r\n     violent chattering and when I ran up, to my amazement I\r\n     found that the Lewis had hold of the California by the\r\n     skull, two of its claws entering the latter’s eyes and the\r\n     other two entering the skull in front and behind. The Lewis\r\n     woodpecker was dead and the California so nearly so that it\r\n     died while I was removing the former’s claws.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Mr. Skinner says in his notes: “In May, at least, these\r\nwoodpeckers are sometimes noisy while calling to their mates. One gave\r\na ringing _cleep-ep_, _cleep-ep_ call on May 25, 1933. It was somewhat\r\nsimilar to a flicker’s call.” Ralph Hoffmann (1927) says: “When a\r\nbird lights on a pole or limb already occupied, there is always mild\r\nexcitement, fluttering of the wings, bowing and scraping, and always\r\na lively interchange of harsh calls, like the syllables _chák-a_,\r\n_chák-a_, _chák-a chak_, dying off at the end.” W. L. Dawson (1923)\r\ngives the following interpretations of its notes: “A jeering, raucous\r\nvoice, * * * _Jacob_, _Jacob_, _Jacob_; * * * _Kerack Kerack_;” and\r\n“_chaar chaar tchurrup_.”\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The California woodpecker is conspicuously marked and\r\nneed not be mistaken for anything else from any angle. When flying\r\naway, it looks like a black bird with an extensive white rump and with\r\na white patch in each wing; when flying over or when perched facing\r\nthe observer, the white abdomen and the broad black band across the\r\nchest are distinctive; if near enough, the color pattern of the head is\r\neasily seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [1] Prof. Ritter’s extensive book (1938) on the California\r\n         woodpecker appeared while this bulletin was in\r\n         press.--EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             BALANOSPHYRA FORMICIVORA ANGUSTIFRONS (Baird)\r\n\r\n                       NARROW-FRONTED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe Cape region of southern Baja California is the home of this\r\nsubspecies. It is a well-marked race, which Ridgway (1914) describes as\r\n“similar to _B. f. formicivora_, but wing averaging much shorter, bill\r\nrelatively larger, white frontal band decidedly narrower, lower throat\r\nusually much more strongly yellow, white area on proximal portion of\r\nremiges smaller, and the adult female with black area on crown much\r\nnarrower.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Brewster (1902) says of its haunts:\r\n\r\n     This woodpecker, which seems to be confined to the Cape\r\n     Region proper, is exceedingly abundant throughout the pine\r\n     forests on the higher mountains south of La Paz and common\r\n     in many places in the oaks at the bases of the mountains\r\n     and among their foot-hills, ranging downward, according to\r\n     Mr. Belding, to an elevation of about 700 feet. Mr. Frazar\r\n     found it most numerous on the Sierra de la Laguna, during\r\n     the last week of April and the first week of May. After\r\n     that its numbers decreased perceptibly. It began breeding\r\n     on this mountain the first week in June, but the breeding\r\n     season was not at its height until the middle of that\r\n     month. * * *\r\n\r\n     Only one specimen was seen at Triunfo during the last two\r\n     weeks of June, but the bird was common and presumably\r\n     breeding at Pierce’s Ranch in July. At the latter place\r\n     it fairly swarmed in December, the resident colony being\r\n     probably augmented by large numbers of winter visitors\r\n     from La Laguna, where Mr. Frazar found only a few birds\r\n     lingering in late November and early December. Along the\r\n     road between San José del Cabo and Miraflores it was seen\r\n     in considerable numbers on November 15, and three were\r\n     observed in some evergreen oaks at Santiago on November 23.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--There is a set of four eggs in the Thayer collection,\r\napparently the same set referred to by Mr. Brewster, collected by M.\r\nAbbott Frazar in the Sierra de la Laguna, on June 3, 1887; the nest is\r\ndescribed as 10 feet up in a dead pine stump; the entrance measured 1¾\r\ninches in diameter, and the cavity was 18 inches deep. The measurements\r\nof these 4 eggs are =24.13= by 19.05, 22.61 by =19.56=, =22.61= by\r\n19.30, and 23.88 by =18.80= millimeters.\r\n\r\nThe food and general habits of this woodpecker do not seem to differ\r\nmaterially from those of the species elsewhere. It has similar\r\nacorn-storing habits, for Mr. Frazar found “many dead pines literally\r\nstuffed full of acorns.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              BALANOSPHYRA FORMICIVORA ACULEATA (Mearns)\r\n\r\n                          MEARNS’S WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                               PLATE 28\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nAlong our southwestern border, from Arizona, New Mexico, and western\r\nTexas southward over northwestern Mexico to Durango, we find this race\r\nof ant-eating woodpecker. It was separated, named, and described by\r\nDr. Edgar A. Mearns (1890a) as follows: “General size and coloring\r\nintermediate between _M. formicivorus_ and M. _formicivorus bairdi_;\r\nthroat less yellow than in either of them; bill shorter, more slender,\r\nand less arcuate than in either of the other forms of M. formicivorus;\r\nwhite striping of chest more than in the Pacific coast form, less than\r\nin _formicivorus_.”\r\n\r\nHe says of its haunts (1890b): “A very common resident through the\r\npine belt, breeding plentifully. I have found it as high as the spruce\r\nforests, but never in them. It is essentially a bird of the pines, only\r\noccasionally descending to the cottonwoods of the low valleys. The oaks\r\nwhich are scattered through the lower pine zone supply a large share of\r\nits food.”\r\n\r\nHenry W. Henshaw (1875) writes: “This woodpecker was first observed\r\nwhen we neared Camp Apache, and, so far as my own observations go, its\r\nrange in Arizona is coincident with that of the oaks, the acorns of\r\nwhich appear to constitute a very important item in its bill of fare.\r\nWe noticed it to the southward in every locality where oaks were found\r\nin sufficiently large groves to afford it at once a place of shelter\r\nand an inexhaustible source whence to draw food.”\r\n\r\nHarry S. Swarth (1904), writing of the Huachuca Mountains, Ariz., says:\r\n“A most abundant summer resident in the lower parts of the mountains;\r\na few winter here but they are scarce during the cold weather. I saw\r\nbut two or three during February and the early part of March, about the\r\nmiddle of March they began to arrive in numbers, and by April 1 were\r\nmost abundant. Primarily a bird of the oak woods they seldom venture\r\ninto the higher parts of the mountains, breeding almost entirely below\r\n6,000 feet.”\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--We found this woodpecker quite common on the steep slopes\r\nof the Huachuca Mountains in May 1922, especially in the vicinity\r\nof Ramsay Canyon, between 5,000 and 6,000 feet elevation. They were\r\nusually seen in the open groves of tall pines mixed with oaks. A\r\ntall dead pine seemed to be one of their favorite resorts for their\r\ncourtship displays, which were both showy and noisy. They reminded me\r\nof flickers as they dodged about the branches, chasing each other and\r\ndisplaying their conspicuous markings.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--I have the records of four sets of eggs, all taken in the\r\nHuachuca Mountains but in a variety of nesting sites. There are two\r\nsets in the Thayer collection; one, containing six eggs, was taken on\r\nMay 10, 1897, from a hole 8 inches deep in the dead limb of a sycamore,\r\n30 feet from the ground; the other set of five eggs was taken on June\r\n1, 1902, from a cavity 10 inches deep in an ash stump, 20 feet from the\r\nground. A set of three eggs, in my collection, was collected by O. W.\r\nHoward on May 31, 1901; the nest was 6 feet above ground in a dead oak\r\nstump. Frank C. Willard took a set of five eggs on May 31, 1899, from a\r\ncavity 15 inches deep, 35 feet up in a large dead pine stub.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Mearns’s woodpecker evidently lays three to six eggs. Major\r\nBendire (1895) mentions a set of ten eggs, taken by F. H. Fowler,\r\nwhich were “evidently the product of two females.” The eggs are pure\r\nwhite, of course, and vary from short-ovate to rounded-ovate, with\r\nonly a slight gloss. The measurements of 20 eggs average 24.07 by\r\n18.91 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =26.8=\r\nby =17.8= (a long narrow egg), 23.9 by =20.8=, and =22.4= by 19.5\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--Mr. Swarth (1904) writes:\r\n\r\n     About July 1 the young birds begin to make their appearance\r\n     so like the adults in general appearance that it is\r\n     difficult to distinguish between them. The young of both\r\n     sexes usually have the entire crown red, as in the adult\r\n     male, but of a duller color, more of a brick red; but one\r\n     young female secured has the red area very limited and\r\n     coming to a point behind, so as to form a small, triangular\r\n     shaped patch on the crown. Of seventeen specimens collected\r\n     in the Huachucas, three show, more or less distinctly,\r\n     white markings on the outer tail feathers. In one of\r\n     these, an adult female, the marks consist of indistinct\r\n     white spots, mostly on the inner web. The other two,\r\n     juvenile females, have the outer feathers distinctly,\r\n     though irregularly, barred with white for about half their\r\n     length.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The food of this woodpecker is evidently similar to that of\r\nother races of the species. Dr. Mearns (1890b) remarks: “Its habit of\r\nindustriously hoarding food in the bark of pines, and in all sorts\r\nof chinks and hollows, is well known. These stores are the source of\r\nunending quarrels between this woodpecker and its numerous pilfering\r\nenemies; and I have laid its supplies under contribution myself, when\r\nshort of provisions and lost from the command with which I had been\r\ntraveling, by filling my saddlebags with half-dried acorns from under\r\nthe loose bark of a dead pine.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Mrs. Bailey (1928) says: “An odd habit of the woodpeckers\r\nwas happened on by Mr. Ligon in the Black Range. At dark, on March\r\n15, 1913, seeing a bird enter a hole about eight feet up in an oak he\r\nclosed it after it, and in the morning when he returned was surprised\r\nto find six birds in the one hole. As the woodpeckers do not nest until\r\nthe last of May, and then in high dead pines, it was, of course, a\r\nnight roost.”\r\n\r\nEd. S. Steele (1926) tells the following story:\r\n\r\n     I was camping in a pine forest not many miles from Reserve,\r\n     N. Mex., accompanied by a small English terrier. In front\r\n     of my tent stood a large dead pine, near the top of which\r\n     there were a number of holes, evidently the homes of four\r\n     pairs of Ant-eating Woodpeckers (_Balanosphyra formicivora\r\n     aculeata_). A gray tassel-eared squirrel came scampering\r\n     along, and was at once spied by the dog, which gave chase.\r\n     The squirrel ran up the dead tree mentioned above, to be\r\n     instantly assailed by the woodpeckers. Their constant cries\r\n     and their sharp bills made things so uncomfortable for the\r\n     squirrel that it ran down the tree to within a few feet of\r\n     the dog, who sent him scampering to the top again with his\r\n     eight antagonists constantly flaying him.\r\n\r\n     About this time there was a swish of wings, and a\r\n     sharp-shinned hawk (_Accipiter velow_) darted like a streak\r\n     among the woodpeckers. For an instant it seemed that one\r\n     of them was doomed, but by a small margin it managed to\r\n     escape, and in an instant they had all darted to cover\r\n     among the green boughs of surrounding trees. All was quiet\r\n     for a few brief seconds, when the woodpeckers returned to\r\n     the attack, except one which perched on the topmost bough\r\n     of a near-by tree, as guard or lookout, watching for the\r\n     hawk. The other seven took up the fight with the squirrel.\r\n\r\n     In a few minutes the hawk again appeared on the scene,\r\n     the guard gave a shrill call of warning, and all the\r\n     woodpeckers were under cover before their enemy could reach\r\n     them. The hawk, then, finding the birds on their guard,\r\n     left and did not return. The terrier soon abandoned the\r\n     tree, and the squirrel hurried down and scampered away; the\r\n     woodpeckers quickly quieted down and went peacefully about\r\n     their home affairs. I believe that the birds recognized in\r\n     the squirrel a danger to their eggs or young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       BALANOSPHYRA FORMICIVORA MARTIRENSIS Grinnell and Swarth\r\n\r\n                         SAN PEDRO WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe acorn-storing woodpecker of the Sierra San Pedro Martir,\r\nnorthwestern Baja California, has been separated and described by\r\nGrinnell and Swarth (1926) under the above name, to which they have\r\nadded the long common name “San Pedro Martir acorn-storing woodpecker.”\r\nIts distinguishing characters are given as follows:\r\n\r\n     Most nearly like _B. f. bairdi_. Distinguished from that\r\n     species primarily by shorter wing, and by slightly shorter\r\n     and notably weaker, more slender bill; also by average\r\n     differences in head markings as set forth below. * * *\r\n\r\n     The relatively feeble bill of this bird, as compared\r\n     with that of the upper California _bairdi_, is the most\r\n     conspicuous character of this subspecies. In bill structure\r\n     it is closely similar to _B. f. aculeata_, of Arizona.\r\n\r\n     The character of the head markings in the female is\r\n     suggestive again of _aculeata_, the red area being usually\r\n     more nearly square, as in that form, rather than shorter\r\n     than wide, as in _bairdi_. The white frontal band averages\r\n     slightly narrower than in _bairdi_, an approach toward the\r\n     condition in _angustifrons_, of the Cape San Lucas region.\r\n     The yellowish white (more dilutely yellow than in _bairdi_)\r\n     U-mark on the lower throat in both sexes averages very much\r\n     narrower in our specimens of _martirensis_ than in a large\r\n     series of _bairdi_ usually only about half the width of the\r\n     former as in the latter. This we are not quite confident of\r\n     as a real character, in that there is a chance that “make”\r\n     of specimen (whether or not the skin of the throat was\r\n     stretched) affects the width of the white band. * * *\r\n\r\n     In character of the markings on the feathers of the breast\r\n     there is no departure from the condition in _bairdi_. The\r\n     upper breast is broadly and solidly black, the black band\r\n     not penetrated posteriorly with white streaks to such an\r\n     extent as in _aculeata_ and _angustifrons_.\r\n\r\nThe range is given as, “so far as now known, only parts of the Sierra\r\nSan Pedro Martir, in northern Lower California, between latitudes\r\n30° and 31°30″; altitude 5,800 to 7,200 feet; life-zone mainly Upper\r\nSonoran (live-oak association), but also Transition locally or\r\nsporadically.”\r\n\r\nThe eggs are similar to those of other races of the species. The\r\nmeasurements of 12 eggs average 26.19 by 18.35 millimeters; the eggs\r\nshowing the four extremes measure =25.1= by =19.4=, =19.0= by 18.5, and\r\n22.8 by =16.8= millimeters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ASYNDESMUS LEWIS (Gray)\r\n\r\n                          LEWIS’S WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                               PLATE 29\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nMy first impression of this curious and interesting woodpecker was of\r\na large, black bird that looked more like a crow than a woodpecker and\r\nthat flew with the strong, steady flight of a crow or a jay, with\r\nnone of the undulations common to so many woodpeckers. I made the same\r\ncomment the second time I saw it, and am interested to see that the\r\nsame impressions were made on many others.\r\n\r\nIt is essentially a bird of the more open country and among scattered\r\nlarge trees, rather than of the heavily forested regions. S. F. Rathbun\r\nwrites to me of its haunts in western Washington: “In this section of\r\nthe State are many tracts of land commonly known as ‘old burns.’ At\r\none time all were forested, then later they were swept by fire and in\r\nsome instances more than once; but even now, on many, still stand the\r\nscarred and blackened trunks of what formerly were large, tall trees;\r\nand it is in or about these unattractive places that this woodpecker is\r\nmore apt to be found, although by no means is it restricted to them.”\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) says: “I have rarely seen Lewis’s woodpecker in\r\ndeep forests; far more frequently just on the outskirts of the pines,\r\nin juniper groves on the table-lands bordering the pines, as well as in\r\nthe deciduous timber along streams in the lowlands, and occasionally\r\neven in solitary cottonwoods or willows, near some little spring, in\r\nthe drier sagebrush-covered flats, miles away from the nearest forest.”\r\n\r\nWinton and Donald Weydemeyer (1928) say that in northwestern Montana it\r\nis--\r\n\r\n     a common summer resident throughout most of the Transition\r\n     zone. It occurs most regularly in mixed broadleaf and\r\n     conifer woods in river valleys, and in open forests of\r\n     yellow pine along the foothills. It rarely ranges into the\r\n     higher mountains, although we observed one individual in a\r\n     Canadian zone forest of lodgepole pine and alpine fir, at\r\n     an altitude of 6,160 feet. In cut-over or burned woods, it\r\n     ranges to a higher elevation than in virgin forests.\r\n\r\n     In the eastern part of the county, this woodpecker is most\r\n     common around farms and slashings, and in the more open\r\n     woods of fir, larch, and yellow pine. Near Libby, in the\r\n     western part, it seems to prefer creek-bottom woods of\r\n     aspen, spruce, and cottonwood.\r\n\r\nJohnson A. Neff (1928) says that his “acquaintance with this exotically\r\nbrilliant woodpecker began in the mountains of Colorado, and even\r\nnow the thought of it calls to mind that bleak, wind-blown area at\r\nan elevation of 8,500 feet, where these birds were very much at home\r\nin the dead trunks of spruce and hemlock that had once covered the\r\nmountains with living verdure.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Mr. Rathbun says in his notes: “In western Washington this\r\nwoodpecker nests in June. Almost invariably the excavation for its\r\nnesting place is in a dead tree, the trunk of which is more or less\r\nblackened by fire, and this may be one reason why the bird is partial\r\nto the old burns. The tree may be one of several scattered about, or,\r\ninfrequently, somewhat isolated. But in any event, this woodpecker\r\nshows a liking for a good-sized tree, broken off at quite a height, the\r\noutside of which has been charred or blackened by the flames. We have\r\nfound many of its nesting places, and among these was one we shall not\r\nforget. In this case, the tree was a very large one, was broken off at\r\na height of about 175 feet, and, as usual, had its outer surface burnt.\r\nNot far below its top was the entrance to the nest of a pair of these\r\nwoodpeckers. Because it was so high it could be distinctly seen only by\r\nthe use of glasses, but often we had noticed one of the birds enter it\r\nor come out of it. This nesting place was used for a number of years,\r\nand when it was in use we have gone out of our way more than once just\r\nto see these woodpeckers; for the top of the tree was used as a lookout\r\nstation by the pair of birds, from which at times one or both would\r\nsail into the air after a flying insect.”\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) says that--\r\n\r\n     it is by no means as particular in the choice of a nesting\r\n     site as the majority of our Woodpeckers. Shortly after\r\n     arriving on their breeding grounds a suitable site is\r\n     selected for the nest, and not infrequently the same\r\n     excavation is used for successive years. In most cases\r\n     the nesting sites are excavated either in the tops of\r\n     tall pines or in dry cottonwoods, and in tall rotten tree\r\n     trunks, occasionally in partly decayed limbs of sycamores,\r\n     oaks, and less frequently in junipers and willows. The\r\n     nests, as a rule, are not easily gotten at, and quite a\r\n     number are practically inaccessible, varying in height from\r\n     6 to fully 100 feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n     * * * [At Camp Harney, Oreg.] these birds nested mostly in\r\n     junipers. * * * The junipers which are selected for nesting\r\n     sites were invariably decayed inside, and after the birds\r\n     had chiseled through the live wood, which was usually\r\n     only from 1 to 2 inches thick, the remainder of the work\r\n     was comparatively easy; the same site, if not disturbed,\r\n     was occupied for several seasons, and in such the inner\r\n     cavity was much deeper, some being fully 30 inches deep and\r\n     generally about 4 inches wide at the bottom. The entrance\r\n     hole varies from 2 to 2½ inches in diameter, and when this\r\n     is made by the birds it is always perfectly circular; but\r\n     occasionally a pair will take advantage of an old knot\r\n     hole, if it and the cavity it leads to are not too large.\r\n\r\nThe Weydemeyers (1928) say that in northwestern Montana this species\r\nexercises a wide range of selection for nesting trees; of four nests\r\nthat they record, two were in larch stubs, one in a dead cottonwood,\r\nand one in a live yellow pine; these nests were in the Transition Zone\r\nat elevations between 2,000 and 3,100 feet.\r\n\r\nEd. S. Currier (1928) found Lewis’s woodpeckers nesting in what\r\nhe called “colonies,” near Portland, Oreg.; in each of two dead\r\ncottonwoods, less than a mile apart, he found three occupied nests all\r\non the same day.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Bendire (1895) says:\r\n\r\n     From five to nine eggs are laid to a set; those of six or\r\n     seven are the most common, but sets of eight are not very\r\n     rare; I have found several of that number, and a single set\r\n     of nine.\r\n\r\n     The eggs of Lewis’s woodpecker vary greatly in shape and\r\n     also in size. They are mostly ovate or short ovate in\r\n     shape, but an occasional set is decidedly rounded ovate,\r\n     while others are elliptical ovate; the shell is close\r\n     grained and, in most cases, dull, opaque white, without\r\n     any gloss whatever. Some sets, however, are moderately\r\n     glossy, but scarcely as much so as the better-known eggs of\r\n     the red-headed woodpecker, and none are as lustrous as the\r\n     eggs of the flicker.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of 58 eggs average 26.22 by 19.99 millimeters; the\r\neggs showing the four extremes measure =30.48= by 21.34, 26.67 by\r\n=24.38=, and =23.37= by =17.27= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Major Bendire (1895) says of the young:\r\n\r\n     Both sexes assist in incubation, and this lasts about two\r\n     weeks. The young leave the nest about three weeks after\r\n     they are hatched, and are readily tamed. I kept a couple\r\n     for several days, but they had such enormous appetites that\r\n     I was glad to give them their liberty, as they kept me\r\n     busy providing suitable food. They were especially fond of\r\n     grasshoppers, but also ate raw meat, and climbed everywhere\r\n     over the rough walls of my house. A considerable share of\r\n     the food of these birds is picked up off the ground, and\r\n     they appear to be much more at home there than woodpeckers\r\n     generally are. The young are fed on insects, and I believe\r\n     also on berries; I have seen one of these birds alight\r\n     in a wild strawberry patch, pick up something, evidently\r\n     a strawberry, fly to a tree close by in which the nest\r\n     was situated, and give it to one of the young which was\r\n     clinging to the side of the tree close to the nesting site.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The young Lewis’s woodpecker is hatched naked and blind,\r\nbut the juvenal plumage is acquired before the young bird leaves\r\nthe nest. In fresh juvenal plumage the red “face” of the adult is\r\nreplaced by black or dusky, though a young bird taken on July 22\r\nshows some red mixed with the black in this area; the bill is small\r\nand weak; the crown and occiput are dull brownish black, without any\r\ngreenish luster; the silvery-gray nuchal collar of the adult is wholly\r\nlacking; the under parts are mostly dull pale gray or dull grayish\r\nwhite, more or less suffused on the central breast and abdomen with\r\ndull red or orange-red; the whole plumage is softer and more blended\r\nin texture. Dr. J. A. Allen (Scott, 1886) says of some young birds\r\nthat he examined: “The back and upper surface of the wings are bronzy\r\ngreen nearly as in the adult, with, however, in addition, broad bars\r\nof steel-blue on the scapulars and quills. These bars are especially\r\nprominent on the secondaries and inner vanes of the primaries, and are\r\nseen also in some specimens on the rectrices. The steel-blue edging the\r\nouter vanes of the quill feathers in the adult is absent; and the inner\r\nsecondaries and longest primaries are tipped more or less prominently\r\nwith white.”\r\n\r\nThis juvenal plumage is worn through the summer and into September,\r\nwhen the molt into the first winter plumage begins with a sprinkling\r\nof the silvery, bristly feathers appearing on the breast and in the\r\ncollar, with the increase of red in the “face,” and with metallic-green\r\nfeathers showing on the head. This molt is apparently prolonged and is\r\nnot finished until early in winter, when young birds and adults are\r\npractically alike. Adults have a complete annual molt late in summer\r\nand fall; I have observed it as late as October 12.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Referring to the food of Lewis’s woodpecker, Major Bendire\r\n(1895) writes:\r\n\r\n     In summer its food consists mainly of insects of different\r\n     kinds, such as grasshoppers, large black crickets, ants,\r\n     beetles, flies, larvæ of different kinds, as well as of\r\n     berries, like wild strawberries and raspberries, service\r\n     berries and salmon berries, acorns, pine seeds, and juniper\r\n     berries, while in cultivated districts cherries and other\r\n     small fruits enter into its daily bill of fare. Here, when\r\n     common, it may occasionally do some little damage in the\r\n     orchards, but this is fully compensated by the noxious\r\n     insects it destroys at the same time. In localities where\r\n     grasshoppers are abundant they live on these pests almost\r\n     exclusively while they last. Mr. Shelly W. Denton tells\r\n     me he noticed this Woodpecker gathering numbers of May\r\n     flies (_Ephemera_) and sticking them in crevices of pines,\r\n     generally in trees in which it nested, evidently putting\r\n     them away for future use, as they lasted but a few days. It\r\n     is an expert flycatcher, and has an extremely keen vision,\r\n     sallying forth frequently after some small insect when this\r\n     is perhaps fully 100 feet from its perch.\r\n\r\nOn this latter subject, Mr. Rathbun writes to me:\r\n\r\n     Lewis’s woodpecker is an expert at catching insects on the\r\n     wing. When in this act, its perch is some vantage spot,\r\n     such as the top of a dead tree or a bare limb in the open.\r\n     Here it sits motionless, except to turn its head from side\r\n     to side on the lookout for its prey; and when this is seen,\r\n     the bird glides from its resting place to make a capture.\r\n     On one occasion for more than an hour, we watched a pair of\r\n     these woodpeckers seize flying insects, and in that length\r\n     of time not less than 35 were taken. Through our field\r\n     glasses we kept a close watch on the birds and soon learned\r\n     from their actions when an insect was sighted, thus it was\r\n     easy for us to anticipate its capture, and in not a single\r\n     instance was a failure made by either of the birds. Once,\r\n     a light puff of air changed the course of the insect just\r\n     at the time it was about to be taken, but the woodpecker\r\n     made a quick turn upward at the same time, dropped its legs\r\n     straight down, and neatly made the take. When busy catching\r\n     insects on the wing, this bird leaves its perch by easy\r\n     wing beats or a long, slow, graceful glide; then, after its\r\n     prey is caught, rises in its flight and, quickly wheeling,\r\n     returns to its lookout station.\r\n\r\n     But, as if not content with hunting insects after the\r\n     manner of a flycatcher, sometimes this bird mingles with\r\n     the swallows as they hawk over the ground. On one occasion\r\n     in summer, as we came to a very open pasture, we noticed\r\n     numbers of barn and cliff swallows in flight over it after\r\n     insects, and in company with them was a pair of Lewis’s\r\n     woodpeckers. Back and forth over the meadow flew these\r\n     dark birds, busy in an attempt to catch flying insects,\r\n     and their actions as they flew were in marked contrast to\r\n     those of the graceful swallows. Although we watched the\r\n     woodpeckers for more than half an hour, throughout that\r\n     time neither one alighted; and when we left the place both\r\n     still coursed busily above the field.\r\n\r\nAbout one-third of the food of Lewis’s woodpecker consists of acorns.\r\nIt shares with the California woodpecker the interesting habit of\r\nstoring acorns, though its method of storing them is quite different,\r\nfor it seldom, if ever, makes the neat round holes to fit the acorns,\r\nso characteristic of the other species; and its stores of acorns are\r\nnever so extensive, so systematic, or so conspicuous as those of the\r\nCalifornia woodpecker. Charles W. Michael (1926) writes:\r\n\r\n     Recently we watched a Lewis Woodpecker making trips back\r\n     and forth between a Kellogg oak and his home tree, a\r\n     cottonwood. He was busy storing away his winter supply of\r\n     acorns. Occasionally he picked a fallen acorn from the\r\n     ground; more often he flew into the lesser branches of the\r\n     oak, and hanging like a great black chickadee he plucked\r\n     the acorn from the cup. With crow-like flappings, his broad\r\n     wings carried him back to the dead cottonwood with his\r\n     prize in his bill. Alighting somewhat below the summit of\r\n     his tree he would, by a series of flight jumps, come to a\r\n     certain shattered stub where a fissure formed a vise. Into\r\n     this he would wedge the acorn.\r\n\r\n     With the acorn held firmly in place he would set about\r\n     cutting away the hull, and strong strokes of his bill would\r\n     soon split away the shell and expose the kernel. But he was\r\n     not satisfied in merely making the kernel accessible, he\r\n     must go on with his pounding until he had broken it into\r\n     several pieces, and then with a piece in his bill he would\r\n     dive into the air like a gymnast, drop twenty or thirty\r\n     feet and come with an upward swoop to perch on the trunk\r\n     of the same tree. A few hitching movements would bring him\r\n     to a deep crack that opened into the heart of the tree.\r\n     Here he would carefully poke away, for future reference,\r\n     his morsel. Usually the acorn was cut into four parts,\r\n     involving four such trips, and on the last trip to the vise\r\n     he would take the empty hull in his bill, and with a jerk\r\n     of his head, toss it into the air. An examination of the\r\n     ground beneath the tree disclosed hundreds of empty acorn\r\n     shells. Holding a watch on the Lewis Woodpecker, we found\r\n     that he made five trips in five minutes and stored five\r\n     acorns.\r\n\r\nJ. Eugene Law (1929) has published another illuminating paper on this\r\nsubject, which is well worth reading; he describes in considerable\r\ndetail the woodpeckers’ methods in storing the meats of acorns in\r\ncracks in poles and indulges in some speculation as to the causes and\r\npurposes involved in the habit.\r\n\r\nHerbert Brown (1902) found Lewis’s woodpeckers quite destructive to\r\npomegranates and quinces, near Tucson, Ariz. On September 30 he counted\r\nten in the pomegranate groves; “they were mostly feeding on pomegranate\r\nfruit. They first cut a hole through the hard skin of the fruit and\r\nthen extract the pulp, leaving nothing but an empty shell.” Later, on\r\nOctober 13, he says: “Now that the pomegranate crop has been destroyed\r\nthey have commenced to eat the quinces, of which there are large\r\nquantities. On the tops of some of the bushes I noticed that every\r\nquince had been eaten into, one side of the fruit being generally eaten\r\naway.”\r\n\r\nWilliam E. Sherwood (1927) writes:\r\n\r\n     On June 16, 1923, while collecting near Imnaha, Wallowa\r\n     County, Oregon, I frightened a Lewis woodpecker from the\r\n     top of a fence post where it was evidently having a feast.\r\n     On top of the post it had left a fresh egg, probably its\r\n     own; for it was absolutely fresh, of the right size, and\r\n     unmarked. The shell had been broken into, but the contents\r\n     not yet extracted.\r\n\r\n     In a knothole on the side of the post was an eggshell (of\r\n     the same kind), and a snail shell which had been broken\r\n     into. Wedged into the cracks of the post were several\r\n     insects (some of them still alive) of the two species\r\n     commonly known as “salmon flies” and “trout flies.” On the\r\n     ground at the foot of the post were several snail shells,\r\n     a green prune (picked into), and several cherry seeds with\r\n     stems attached.\r\n\r\nJohnson A. Neff (1928) has much to say about the economic status of\r\nthis woodpecker, mainly in Oregon. A few quotations from his paper will\r\nserve to show the vast amount of damage to the fruit grower that it\r\ndoes in sections where it is abundant, mainly in summer and fall. He\r\nsays that Prof. Beal (1911) “mentions one case in Washington wherein\r\nthe birds tore the paper at the corners of packed boxes of apples left\r\nin the orchard over night, picking into every apple within reach, and\r\nnecessitating the repacking of every box attacked.”\r\n\r\nS. D. Hill wrote to Mr. Neff:\r\n\r\n     In some sections and seasons they will destroy carloads of\r\n     fruit, especially in orchards near timber. I have known\r\n     them to do 50 percent damage to a pear crop in the Peyton\r\n     district on upper Rogue River. Jackson Gyger, Ashland,\r\n     wrote: “In 1924 the loss on Spitz and Delicious apples was\r\n     about 75 percent, on Newtowns about 15 percent; Bosc and\r\n     Anjou pears about 10 percent. The loss on trees near oak\r\n     timber was nearly 100 percent. This season (1925) due to\r\n     hunting them every day the loss was possibly 50 percent\r\n     less. I bought $18.00 worth of ammunition to combat them\r\n     this year. One man can not keep them out of a seven acre\r\n     orchard, as they will work on one end while you are scaring\r\n     them out of the other.”\r\n\r\nMr. Neff goes on to say:\r\n\r\n     These complaints can not be over-looked, for stomach\r\n     analyses show only the volume of fruit eaten, not the\r\n     percentage of fruit damaged per tree, nor the real loss to\r\n     the orchardist. * * *\r\n\r\n     In Oregon, although it sometimes becomes a nuisance in the\r\n     small fruit plantings of various areas, it centers its\r\n     destructive activities in the Rogue Valley; there it flocks\r\n     in the greatest abundance. * * *\r\n\r\n     In this area there can be no question of the objectionable\r\n     status of the Lewis woodpecker. If the birds would consume\r\n     each fruit injured, there would be little complaint of\r\n     their taking the quantity which probably would satisfy\r\n     them. They are restless and energetic, however, and always\r\n     attacking fresh fruit, which with one stroke of the bill\r\n     is ruined for commercial use. If one allows only one bite\r\n     to each fruit, some of the stomachs studied would have\r\n     contained the samples of as high as two bushels of fruit.\r\n     In the restricted areas mentioned the Lewis woodpecker is a\r\n     pest.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Lewis’s woodpecker seldom indulges in the undulating\r\nflight so common to other woodpeckers, though it sometimes swings in a\r\nlong curve in a short flight from tree to tree. Its ordinary, traveling\r\nflight is quite unlike the flight of other members of the family; it is\r\nstrong, direct, and rather slow, with steady strokes of its long, broad\r\nwings. At first glance one would hardly recognize it as a woodpecker,\r\nfor its flight and its appearance are more suggestive of a crow, a\r\nClarke’s nutcracker, or a jay. But it is far from clumsy in the air,\r\nand its skill in catching insects on the wing demonstrates is mastery\r\nof the air in flight. It also indulges in some rather remarkable\r\naerial evolutions, which one would hardly expect from a member of the\r\nwoodpecker family. On this subject, Robert Ridgway (1877) writes:\r\n\r\n     In its general habits and manners this beautiful species\r\n     resembles quite closely the eastern Red-headed Woodpecker\r\n     (_M. erythrocephalus_), being quite as lively and of an\r\n     equally playful disposition. Some of its actions, however,\r\n     are very curious, the most remarkable of them being a\r\n     certain elevated flight, performed in a peculiar floating\r\n     manner, its progress apparently laborious, as if struggling\r\n     against the wind, or uncertain, like a bird which had\r\n     lost its course and become confused. At such a time it\r\n     presents the appearance of a Crow high in the air, while\r\n     the manner of its flight is strikingly similar to that\r\n     of Clarke’s Nutcracker (_Picicorvus columbianus_). * * *\r\n     After performing these evolutions to its satisfaction, it\r\n     descends in gradually contracting circles, often to the\r\n     tree from which it started.\r\n\r\nHerbert Brown (1902) evidently saw a similar flight, of which he says:\r\n“In flight they have little or none of that laborious undulating\r\nmovement so common to its kind, but in action and flight they seem\r\npossessed of peculiarities supposed to belong to birds of a totally\r\ndifferent family. Today not less than fifty of them were circling\r\nthrough the air, at an elevation of about 500 feet, with all the ease\r\nand grace of the Falconidae. Not a stroke of the wing was apparent.\r\n* * * Those high in the air were sailing in great circles. They kept\r\nit up indefinitely and had the appearance of being so many miniature\r\ncrows. When sailing they appear to open their wings to the fullest\r\nextent possible.”\r\n\r\nMr. Neff (1928) states that “these birds love the hottest sunshine,\r\nand are commonly found perched in the tiptop of some tall partly-dead\r\ntree, whence they can scan the air for insect food. They rarely sit\r\nvertically upright on a branch as do most other woodpeckers, but perch\r\ncross-wise with ease. They seldom climb up the trunk or branches,\r\nalthough perfectly capable of doing so, and are rarely heard tapping.”\r\nThey perch occasionally on wires, an uncommon habit with other\r\nwoodpeckers.\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) observes: “On its breeding grounds Lewis’s\r\nwoodpecker appears to be a stupid and rather sluggish bird; it does not\r\nshow nearly as much parental affection as most of the other members\r\nof this family, and is much less demonstrative. It is not at all shy\r\nat such times, and will often cling to some convenient limb on the\r\nsame tree while its eggs are being taken, without making the least\r\ncomplaint.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Bendire (1895) says: “It is by far the most silent woodpecker\r\nI have met, and, aside from a low twittering, it rarely utters a loud\r\nnote. Even when suddenly alarmed, and when it seeks safety in flight,\r\nthe shrill ‘huit, huit’ given on such occasions by nearly all of our\r\nwoodpeckers is seldom uttered by it. Only when moving about in flocks,\r\non their first arrival in the spring and during the mating season,\r\nwhich follows shortly afterwards, does it indulge in a few rattling\r\ncall notes, resembling those of the Red-shafted Flicker, and it drums\r\nmore or less, in a lazy sort of way, on the dead top of a tall pine, or\r\na suitable limb of a cottonwood or willow.”\r\n\r\nRalph Hoffmann (1927) writes: “For a great part of the year the Lewis\r\nwoodpecker is a silent bird, uttering not even a call note, but in the\r\nmating season it utters a harsh _chirr_ and a high-pitched squalling\r\n_chee-up_, repeated at rather long intervals. Adult birds utter near\r\nthe nest a series of sharp metallic cries like the syllable _ick, ick,\r\nick_, which when rapidly repeated become a rattle. The young in the\r\nnest utter the usual hissing sound of young woodpeckers.”\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--Lewis’s woodpecker should be easily recognized. At a\r\ndistance it appears likes a black bird, the back and the upper and\r\nlower surfaces of the wings being black, with no conspicuous white\r\nshowing anywhere, and with a crowlike flight, broad wings and black\r\ntail. At short range, the greenish sheen of the back may glisten in the\r\nsunlight, and the silvery gray collar and pinkish underparts may be\r\nseen, as well as the gray upper breast and perhaps the red face.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--This woodpecker seems to be a highly migratory species. From\r\nthe northern parts of its range it disappears almost entirely during\r\nwinter; and throughout its entire range it is given to extensive\r\nwanderings, being very abundant in certain localities during fall and\r\nwinter in certain seasons and at other seasons entirely absent. The\r\nspecies is highly gregarious in fall, wandering about in large flocks\r\nin search for suitable food supplies.\r\n\r\nMr. Rathbun tells me that this woodpecker is found in Washington from\r\nApril to about November and occasionally is seen in winter, and says:\r\n“In this part [western] of the State the fall migration of this bird\r\nseems to begin early in September. Once, very early in the month,\r\non our arrival at a lake not far from Seattle, we noticed a large\r\nnumber of these woodpeckers in three or four deciduous trees along\r\nthe shore. Occasionally, a few of the birds would make short flights\r\nafter insects in the air, but by far the larger number were more or\r\nless inactive and appeared to be resting, as some remained motionless\r\nwhere perched. And when one did change its position, it did this in\r\na listless manner. Our arrival at the lake was rather late in the\r\nafternoon, and from the actions of the birds as a whole we gained the\r\nimpression that they must have made quite an extended flight that day\r\non their movement southward. On several other occasions in September we\r\nhave seen this woodpecker as it was migrating. In each case a good many\r\nwere in company, though rather loosely associated. And once, moving in\r\na southerly direction with them for a very brief time, were numbers of\r\nnighthawks, swallows, and Vaux’s swifts flying around for insects.”\r\n\r\nMr. Neff (1928) writes:\r\n\r\n     This species, more than all its kin, moves in flocks in\r\n     autumn. After the nesting season it gathers into flocks\r\n     of from 10 to 300 or more. In such numbers it drops down\r\n     into the fruit districts of southern Oregon and of northern\r\n     California, and disaster results. * * *\r\n\r\n     On August 29, the writer, accompanied by Mr. Richardson,\r\n     made a trip to Lake of the Woods, Klamath County. Just\r\n     south of Ashland a few scattered individuals were seen. As\r\n     the Cascade summit was approached many were seen in the\r\n     open fields and meadows. In the flats near the lake, and\r\n     in the open meadows near Rainbow Creek, numbers were found\r\n     feeding on the mountain huckleberries. Returning to Ashland\r\n     on September 1, huge flocks of these birds could be seen\r\n     moving steadily toward the lower Valley. * * *\r\n\r\n     On September 7, also, the growers in the vicinity of\r\n     Medford reported the arrival of the first birds there.\r\n     Flocks were present until September 19, when almost every\r\n     bird in the area disappeared. A few scattering individuals\r\n     were left in various foothill areas, but these left during\r\n     November. The areas in which they wintered so abundantly\r\n     during the 1924-5 season were totally deserted during the\r\n     1925-6 season, and not until spring did they return to this\r\n     area.\r\n\r\nHerbert Brown (1902) states that Lewis’s woodpeckers appeared in large\r\nnumbers, during the fall of 1884, in the Santa Cruz Valley, Ariz., the\r\nfirst he had seen there for 20 years. He saw the first one on September\r\n28 and ten on the 30th. They were very abundant at times during October\r\nbut disappeared at intervals. They were last seen on November 16.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--W. E. D. Scott (1886) says of its winter habits in Arizona:\r\n\r\n     About my house it generally appeared about the 20th of\r\n     September, and some years was very abundant. It stays as\r\n     late as April 20, and then is not seen again till fall,\r\n     though I have seen the species in the pine region above me\r\n     late in the spring. In 1884, there was an unprecedented\r\n     abundance of the species throughout the entire region under\r\n     consideration. They came in countless numbers about the\r\n     ranches, both on the San Pedro and near Tucson. Arriving\r\n     early in September, they did great injury to the fruit\r\n     crops raised in these regions, and I heard much complaint\r\n     of them. In the oak woods they were equally abundant,\r\n     living almost altogether on acorns, but spending much of\r\n     the warmer portion of the day catching insects on the wing,\r\n     very much as any of the larger flycatchers do, only that\r\n     on leaving the perch of observation or rest, the flight is\r\n     much more prolonged than in the flycatchers that I have\r\n     seen.\r\n\r\nLewis’s woodpeckers sometimes remain in winter, in small numbers, as\r\nfar north as the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia. According to\r\nSuckley and Cooper (1860), they are “constant winter residents” near\r\nFort Dalles on the Columbia River. Of their winter habits, Suckley\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     They seem in winter to be semi-gregarious, flying singly,\r\n     yet still keeping more or less in each other’s company.\r\n     Their flight at this season is high and very erratic,\r\n     resembling much, in its characteristic peculiarities,\r\n     that of the swallow On warm days they keep up a lively\r\n     chattering noise, unlike, in character, that of any other\r\n     woodpecker that I have heard. During the cold season they\r\n     are so shy that it is difficult to shoot them, as at the\r\n     least alarm they betake themselves to the tops of the\r\n     highest trees in the vicinity. They at that season subsist\r\n     principally upon the larvae of insects, found in the cracks\r\n     and fissures of the “red pine” of the country. I dissected\r\n     a specimen killed at Fort Dalles, January 9, 1855, finding\r\n     the coats of the stomach (gizzard) very thick and muscular,\r\n     its cavity filled with the white larvae of insects,\r\n     together with fine gravel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Western United States, southwestern Canada, and northwestern\r\nMexico; migratory in the northern areas.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--Lewis’s woodpecker breeds =north= to southern\r\nBritish Columbia (Courtenay, Okanagan Landing, and Arrow Lake);\r\nMontana (Fortine, Flathead Lake, and Great Falls); and southwestern\r\nSouth Dakota (Elk Mountains). =East= to southwestern South Dakota\r\n(Elk Mountains); southeastern Wyoming (Laramie Hills and Laramie);\r\neastern Colorado (Boulder, Denver, Colorado Springs, Boone, and Rouse\r\nJunction); and New Mexico (Bojuaque and Sacramento Mountain). =South=\r\nto southern New Mexico (Sacramento Mountain); Arizona (San Francisco\r\nMountain and Fort Whipple); and southern California (Paso Robles).\r\n=West= through the coast ranges of California, Oregon, Washington, and\r\nBritish Columbia (Victoria, Comox, and Courtenay).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--On the Pacific coast the species is resident =north=\r\nto the Columbia River (Portland and The Dalles, Oreg.) and is found\r\n=south= at this season to northern Baja California (Catavina and\r\nGuadalupe Valley). During two different winters these woodpeckers were\r\nrecorded wintering in southern British Columbia (Alowna in 1920-21,\r\nVernon in 1928-29, and Summerland 1928-29).\r\n\r\nIn the Rocky Mountain region it winters =north= to north-central\r\nColorado (Boulder and Denver) and is found =south= to central Texas\r\n(San Angelo); southern New Mexico (Guadalupe Mountains); and northern\r\nSonora (5 miles southwest of Nogales, Ariz.).\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--At neither season is the migratory movement\r\nextensive, but the following early dates of arrival in the\r\nnorthern parts of the breeding range may be considered typical:\r\nWyoming--Wheatland, April 15; Laramie, May 5; Yellowstone Park, May 14.\r\nMontana--Fortine, April 27; Big Hole River, May 1; Corvallis, May 6.\r\nWashington--Grand Dalles, April 23; Prescott, April 26; Tacoma, April\r\n27.

Throughout much of this range, it is one\r\nof the commonest and most conspicuous of the woodpeckers. Arthur H.\r\nHowell (1932) writes: “In Florida, red-bellied woodpeckers are found\r\nchiefly in hammocks, groves, and wet bottomland timber, less commonly\r\nin the pine woods and the cypress swamps. * * * These woodpeckers are\r\nnot particularly shy, and they often visit dooryards and orchards.” In\r\nTexas, according to George Finlay Simmons (1925), its favorite haunts\r\nare “heavily timbered bottom lands or swampy woods; open deciduous or\r\nmixed coniferous woodlands with very large trees; heavy woods of oak\r\nand elm along river and creek bottoms; shade trees and dead trees in\r\ntown.” Major Bendire (1895) says: “Throughout the northern portions of\r\nits range it prefers deciduous or mixed forests to coniferous, but in\r\nthe south it is apparently as common in the flat, low pine woods as in\r\nthe oak hammocks. Newly cleared lands in which numbers of girdled trees\r\nstill remain standing are favorite resorts for this as well as other\r\nspecies.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Bendire (1895) writes:\r\n\r\n     Birds that migrate from the northern portions of their\r\n     range usually arrive on their breeding grounds rather\r\n     early, sometimes by March 20, and shortly afterwards\r\n     preparations for nesting are commenced. A suitable site is\r\n     readily found in the decayed top of some tree, or in an\r\n     old stump, near a stream along the edges of a pasture, or\r\n     close to some road, and less often farther in the center\r\n     of a forest. Deciduous trees, especially the softer wooded\r\n     ones, such as elms, basswood, maple, chestnut, poplar,\r\n     willow, and sycamore, are preferred to the harder kinds,\r\n     such as ash, hickory, oak, etc. In northern Florida they\r\n     nest frequently in pines. Several excavations are often\r\n     found in the same tree in which the nest is located, and\r\n     occasionally the same site, with slight repairs, is used\r\n     for more than one season. * * *\r\n\r\n     Both sexes assist in excavating the nesting site, as well\r\n     as in incubation, which lasts about fourteen days. The\r\n     sites selected are usually from 5 to 70 feet from the\r\n     ground, and resemble those of our Woodpeckers in every\r\n     respect, averaging about 12 inches in depth. It takes from\r\n     seven to ten days to excavate a nest, and frequently the\r\n     birds rest a week afterwards before beginning to lay; an\r\n     egg is deposited daily, and from three to five are usually\r\n     laid to a set, rarely more.\r\n\r\nMr. Howell (1932) says that in Florida “almost any kind of a tree\r\nwill satisfy the birds for a nesting site, but a partly decayed stub\r\nseemingly is preferred. Where cabbage palms occur, a dead stub of that\r\ntree is often chosen, and cavities in oaks, cypresses, pines, and\r\nother trees are frequently utilized, the nesting hole being anywhere\r\nfrom 5 to 70 feet from the ground, usually, however, under 40 feet.\r\nNesting begins in April and continues until June.” The only nest I ever\r\nexamined in Florida was found on April 25, 1903, on one of the Bowlegs\r\nKeys, in the Bay of Florida; it was placed in a dead branch of a black\r\nmangrove; the cavity was about 14 inches deep and contained four fresh\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons (1925) says that in Texas this woodpecker nests in “dead\r\nlimbs of stumps of hackberry, Chinaberry, cedar elm, pecan, and\r\nAmerican water elm trees, particularly the rotten, shaky, skeleton\r\nupper-parts of living hackberry trees in backyards, or in telegraph\r\npoles along city streets and alleys.” In a small village in Texas I\r\nonce found a nest containing three eggs in a fencepost near one of the\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nVarious observers have given quite different measurements of the\r\nnesting cavity. Mr. Simmons (1925) says: “Entrance, diameter 1.75 to\r\n1.96. Cavity, depth 10 to 12; widest diameter near bottom (3 above\r\neggs) 5.25.” William H. Fisher (1903) found a nest in Maryland in which\r\n“the opening measured 2 by 2¼ inches and it was 5 inches from the outer\r\nedge of the hole to the back wall.”\r\n\r\nCharles R. Stockard (1904) located a nest in Mississippi, of which he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     In the spring of 1900 a nest of this species was located\r\n     in a dead cottonwood tree which stood in an open pasture.\r\n     The nest was a burrow fifteen inches deep with a perfectly\r\n     circular entrance about forty feet above the ground. A set\r\n     of five eggs was taken from it on April 24. The entrance\r\n     being small it was found necessary to cut it larger so as\r\n     to admit my hand. Twenty-three days later the same nest\r\n     contained a second set of five eggs, slightly incubated.\r\n     The enlarging of the entrance evidently had no ill effect\r\n     except for the fact that the burrow had been deepened\r\n     several inches, probably to prevent an extra amount of\r\n     light on the floor of the nest. These birds seem to gauge\r\n     the depth of their excavations more by the amount of light\r\n     admitted than from any instinct to dig a certain distance.\r\n     For example, burrows that had their entrance just below a\r\n     limb or were situated in shady woods were noticed, as a\r\n     rule, to be shallower than those located in exposed fields\r\n     or on the sunny side of the tree.\r\n\r\nBayard H. Christy (1931) describes a nest found in Pennsylvania as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     The hole was in the top of a great primeval white oak,\r\n     standing in the bottom of a wooded ravine and at the edge\r\n     of a neglected clearing, in southern Beaver County. I had\r\n     discovered it a month or six weeks before, attracted by\r\n     the calls of the bird. The hole was drilled in a dead and\r\n     vertically standing bough about eight inches in diameter,\r\n     in the very centre of the crown of the oak, and was, I\r\n     should say, about eighty feet above the ground; it was\r\n     drilled in the northern side of the bough, and beneath the\r\n     talus of a branch which had died and fallen away, leaving\r\n     a knot-hole a few inches above. The woodpeckers’ hole was\r\n     newly cut, and the bark around and beneath it had been\r\n     trimmed by use or by design, so that the region about\r\n     formed a tawny patch upon the grey of the bough.\r\n\r\nS. A. Grimes (1932) mentions four cases that have come under his\r\nobservation, in which red-bellied woodpeckers have occupied old nests\r\nof red-cockaded woodpeckers in Florida. F. M. Phelps (1914) mentions\r\nanother similar case.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The red-bellied woodpecker lays three to eight eggs, usually\r\nfour or five. It is a persistent layer; if the first set is taken, it\r\nwill lay a second set within a week or two, generally in the same nest.\r\nMr. Stockard (1904) reports his experience with a pair that laid four\r\nsets of eggs, 19 eggs in all, and all in the same nest.\r\n\r\nBendire (1895) says that “the eggs are white, mostly ovate in shape;\r\nthe shell is fine grained and rather dull looking, with little or\r\nno gloss, resembling in this respect the eggs of Lewis’s woodpecker\r\nmore than those of the red-headed species.” I have seen eggs that are\r\nelliptical-ovate in shape, and decidedly glossy; eggs that have been\r\nincubated for some time become more glossy than when first laid. The\r\nmeasurements of 50 eggs average 25.06 by 18.78 millimeters; the eggs\r\nshowing the four extremes measure =27.00= by 19.79, 25.15 by =23.62=,\r\n=23.00= by 18.70, and 23.11 by =16.76= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation is said to be about 14 days. Both\r\nsexes assist in this and in the feeding and care of the young. In the\r\nmore northern portions of its range, probably only one brood is reared\r\nin a season, but in the South this woodpecker is said to raise two and\r\nsometimes three broods.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--Like other woodpeckers, the young are hatched naked and\r\nblind, but the juvenal plumage is acquired before the young leave the\r\nnest. In this the young male closely resembles the adult female, but\r\nthe colors are duller, the barring is less distinct, and the white bars\r\nare suffused with brownish white; there are indistinct dusky shaft\r\nstreaks on the chest and little or no red on the abdomen, which, if\r\npresent, is more orange or yellowish; there is no clear red on the\r\nhead, but the gray crown is sometimes suffused centrally with dark red\r\nmixed with the gray; the hind neck is often suffused with pinkish or\r\nyellowish. The juvenal female is similar to the young male, but the\r\ntop of the head is darker gray, or dusky, and there is less reddish\r\nor yellowish suffusion anywhere. The juvenal plumage is apparently\r\nworn through the first fall; I have seen it as late as December 20,\r\nbut Forbush (1927) says that it is shed between August and October. In\r\nthe first winter plumage, there is an advance toward maturity, young\r\nmales acquiring more red on the crown and occiput, and young females\r\non the latter. There is probably a more or less continuous molt during\r\nwinter, or a partial prenuptial molt in early spring, by which young\r\nbirds become practically indistinguishable from adults. Adults have a\r\ncomplete postnuptial molt late in summer and early in fall.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Bendire (1895) says:\r\n\r\n     Its food consists of about equal proportions of animal and\r\n     vegetable matter, and it feeds considerably on the ground.\r\n     Insects, like beetles, ants, grasshoppers, different\r\n     species of flies, and larvae are eaten by them, as well\r\n     as acorns, beechnuts, pine seeds, juniper berries, wild\r\n     grapes, blackberries, strawberries, pokeberries, palmetto\r\n     and sour-gum berries, cherries, and apples. In the South\r\n     it has acquired a liking for the sweet juice of oranges\r\n     and feeds to some extent on them; but as it always returns\r\n     to the same one, until this ceases to yield any more\r\n     juice, the damage done in this is slight. It has also been\r\n     observed drinking the sweet sap from the troughs in sugar\r\n     camps. The injury it commits by the little fruit it eats\r\n     during the season is fully atoned for by the numerous\r\n     insects and their larvae which it destroys at the same\r\n     time, and I therefore consider this handsome Woodpecker\r\n     fully worthy of protection.\r\n\r\nAn examination of 22 stomachs by Professor Beal (1895) showed: “Animal\r\nmatter (insects) 26 percent and vegetable matter 74 percent. A small\r\nquantity of gravel was found in 7 stomachs, but was not reckoned as\r\nfood. Ants were found in 14 stomachs, and amounted to 11 percent of\r\nthe whole food. Adult beetles stand next in importance, aggregating\r\n7 percent of all food, while larval beetles only reach 3 percent.\r\nCaterpillars had been taken by only 2 birds, but they had eaten so many\r\nthat they amounted to 4 percent of the whole food. The remaining animal\r\nfood is made up of small quantities of bugs(_Hemiptera_), crickets\r\n(_Orthoptera_), and spiders, with a few bones of a small tree frog\r\nfound in 1 stomach taken in Florida.”\r\n\r\nThe red-bellied woodpecker eats some corn, which it has been seen to\r\nsteal from corncribs and from bunches of corn hung up to dry. Various\r\nberries have been recorded in its food, besides those mentioned above,\r\nmulberries, elderberries, bayberries, blueberries, and the berries of\r\nthe Virginia creeper, cornel, holly, dogwood, and poison ivy, also\r\nthe seeds of ragweed and wild sarsaparilla, hazelnuts, and pecans. N.\r\nM. MCGuire (1932) saw one feeding at the borings of a yellow-bellied\r\nsapsucker on a sugar maple tree, driving the latter away; he “would fly\r\nat the Sapsucker, causing him to dodge around a limb in order to keep\r\nout of the way.”\r\n\r\nDr. B. H. Warren (1890) first called attention to the orange-eating\r\nhabit of the red-bellied woodpecker in Florida, where it is called the\r\n“orange sapsucker” or “orange borer.” He found on inquiry that these\r\nbirds often destroyed large numbers of oranges when they were ready\r\nfor picking and that “they damaged the orange trees by boring holes in\r\nthem and sucking the sap.” He collected 26 of these woodpeckers in one\r\norchard, 11 of which had “fed to a more or less extent on oranges.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Brewster (1889) saw a red-bellied woodpecker eating the pulp of\r\na sweet orange at Enterprise, Fla. He says that it attacked the orange\r\non the ground, pecking at it in a slow and deliberate way for several\r\nminutes. On examining the orange he found it to be decayed on one\r\nside. “In the sound portion were three holes, each nearly as large as\r\na silver dollar, with narrow strips of peel between them. The pulp had\r\nbeen eaten out quite to the middle of the fruit. Small pieces of rind\r\nwere thickly strewn about the spot. Upon searching closely I discovered\r\nseveral other oranges that had been attacked in a similar manner. All\r\nwere partially decayed, and were lying on the ground. I was unable to\r\nfind any on the trees which showed any marks of the Woodpecker’s bill.”\r\n\r\nCertainly the habit of eating fallen and partially decayed oranges\r\ndoes no injury to the orange groves, but D. Mortimer (1890) tells a\r\ndifferent story:\r\n\r\n     While gathering fruit or pruning orange trees, I frequently\r\n     found oranges that had been riddled by this woodpecker,\r\n     and repeatedly saw the bird at work. I never observed\r\n     it feeding upon fallen oranges. It helped itself freely\r\n     to sound fruit that still hung on the tree, and in some\r\n     instances I have found ten or twelve oranges on one trees\r\n     that had been tapped by it. Where an orange accidentally\r\n     rested on a branch in such a way as to make the flower end\r\n     accessible from above or from a horizontal direction the\r\n     Woodpecker chose that spot, as through it he could reach\r\n     into all the sections of the fruit, and when this was the\r\n     case there was but one hole in the orange. But usually\r\n     there were many holes around it. It appeared that after\r\n     having once commenced on an orange, the woodpecker returned\r\n     to the same one repeatedly until he had completely\r\n     consumed the pulp, and then he usually attacked another\r\n     very near to it. Thus I have found certain clusters in\r\n     which every orange had been bored, while all the others on\r\n     the tree were untouched.\r\n\r\nThe red-bellied woodpecker shares with other species, formerly included\r\nin the genus _Melanerpes_, the habit of storing acorns, nuts, insects,\r\nand other articles of food for future use. Ben. J. Blincoe (1923)\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     The red-bellied woodpecker is a heavy feeder on beech and\r\n     oak mast. In the early fall its incessant “Cha-cha-cha”\r\n     was a familiar sound in the beech woods about Cherry\r\n     Hill. I never observed it in the act of storing beech\r\n     mast though on numerous occasions red-bellied woodpeckers\r\n     were seen carrying beechnuts to a considerable distance\r\n     from the trees from which they were secured. Very likely\r\n     many of these nuts were wedged in cracks or crevices for\r\n     future use. However, in the fall of 1913, a red-belly was\r\n     seen storing the acorns from a Chinquapin Oak (_Quercus\r\n     acuminata_) which stood over the wood-pile at Cherry Hill.\r\n     The acorns were carried, one at a time, to fence posts\r\n     ranging from twenty-five to three hundred yards distant\r\n     from the oak tree, and were generally wedged in a crack in\r\n     the post, usually near the top. One acorn was placed in\r\n     a cavity caused by decay, and laid loosely on the rotten\r\n     wood. As far as my observations went, but one acorn was\r\n     placed in a single post\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Blincoe was shelling walnuts, he saw one of these woodpeckers\r\ncarry off the shells, and apparently eat the remaining meat out of\r\nthem. Several times he saw one stealing corn from his corncrib or\r\nflying off with cherries from a tree in his garden and sometimes\r\ncarrying them to a fence post to eat. Again he watched one eating\r\na hole in an apple, and “found that the apple on which it had been\r\nworking bore a decayed spot near the stem and just at the edge of it,\r\nbut entirely in the solid part of the apple, was a hole about half\r\nan inch across, and three-quarters deep. The bottom of this cavity\r\ncontained several tiny holes, markings made by the woodpecker’s\r\nmandibles. In the early winter, frequently, a red-belly would be seen\r\nfeeding on an apple that remained on the tree, though decayed and\r\npractically dried up.”\r\n\r\nLester W. Smith writes to me that it seems to be a habit of the\r\nred-bellied woodpecker in Florida to store away insects and other\r\nfood. “After digging into and capturing an insect, I see it fly to a\r\nsmall hole, commonly in the trunk of the cabbage palmetto, and place\r\nthe insect in it. At a hole 5 feet from the ground I found a male\r\n_carolinus_ inserting the badly mutilated body of a cockroach. A large\r\nportion of his catches or finds he seems to prefer to hide away. A tree\r\nof small, late tangerines was visited almost daily during the latter\r\nhalf of May, and sections of the pulp, taken from fruit torn open by\r\nthe mockingbird, were carried off and hidden in various places. On\r\nJune 3 I saw _carolinus_ go to the base of banana leaves, take out a\r\nsection of pulp, and fly away with it. Examination showed other pieces\r\nsimilarly hidden, some with ants on them.”\r\n\r\nM. P. Skinner (1928) says: “Although other woodpeckers carry off\r\nand store bits of food, the red-bellied woodpeckers appear to do it\r\nmore than any others in the Sandhills. These birds are rather easily\r\nattracted to artificial feeding stations, especially if suet be offered\r\nthem. They will eat nuts and bread crumbs, also, but not as greedily.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--Mr. Skinner (1928) writes: “In flight, these woodpeckers\r\nare apt to progress step by step from tree to tree. In this respect,\r\nand in that it is undulating, their flight is much like that of other\r\nwoodpeckers. In approaching a perch, the red-bellied woodpeckers\r\nusually glide and sweep up to it with the impetus already gained. * * *\r\nThese woodpeckers work and hammer on the trunks of trees, on the boles\r\nof oaks, on boles high up in live or blasted pines, and on both living\r\nand dead limbs, usually working up, but working down also if they want\r\nto, using a peculiar partly-sidewise drop downward.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Mr. Simmons (1925) gives the following elaborate\r\ninterpretations of the various calls of this noisy bird:\r\n\r\n     In fall and winter, a soft scolding _chuh_; _chuh-chuh_;\r\n     _chow-chow_; _cherr-cherr_; or _chawh-chawh_. At other\r\n     seasons, a variety of calls: a slow, harsh _crer-r-r-r-r-r_\r\n     _rrrrrr_ or _chur-r-r-r-r_ _rrrrrr_; a noisy _charr-r-r_ or\r\n     _chawh-chawh_; a rather slow, regular _chuh-chuh-chuh-chuh-chuh_,\r\n     sometimes uttered in a series of a dozen or more as rapidly\r\n     as the syllables can be plainly pronounced; a very rapid\r\n     _chuck-a-chuck-a-chuck-a-chuck-a-chuck-a-chuck-a-chuck-a_; a\r\n     slow, harsh _sherr_, _cherr_, _cherr_ or _crerr_, _crerr_,\r\n     _crerr_, _crerr_, _crerr_; an alarmed _cha-cha-cha_; at\r\n     intervals, a loud, bold, running, connected _koo er-r-r-r_;\r\n     _qu er-r-r-r-r_; _qui er-r-r-r-r_; or _k-r-r-ring_, uttered\r\n     with a distinct rolling of the _r_’s; in the nesting season,\r\n     an additional _whicker_.\r\n\r\nBendire (1895) says: “The Red-bellied, like the majority of our\r\nWoodpeckers, is a rather noisy bird. Its ordinary call note resembles\r\nthe ‘tchurr, tchurr’ of the red-headed very closely; another sounds\r\nmore like ‘chawh, chawh,’ and this is occasionally varied with a\r\ndisagreeable creaking note, while during the mating season peculiar,\r\nlow, mournful cooing sounds are sometimes uttered, which somewhat\r\nresemble those of the Mourning Dove.”\r\n\r\nVarious other observers have given somewhat similar descriptions of\r\nsome of the above interpretations. When I first saw this woodpecker,\r\nmany years ago in Florida, climbing up the trunk of a cabbage palmetto,\r\nits rolling notes sounded to me like those of a tree toad, as heard\r\nbefore a rain.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The red-bellied woodpecker is so conspicuously marked\r\nthat it could hardly be overlooked. It is a medium-sized woodpecker,\r\nabout the size of the hairy; the entire back and rump are conspicuously\r\nbarred transversely with black and white; the wings are spotted or\r\nbarred with white; the under parts are uniform gray, except for the\r\ninconspicuous reddish tinge on the abdomen; in the male the entire\r\ncrown and nape are brilliant scarlet, and a large patch of the same\r\ncolor adorns the nape of the female.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--The migrations of this woodpecker are, apparently, not so\r\nextensive or so regular as those of most migratory birds; they seem\r\nto consist more of irregular wanderings and to depend more on the\r\nabundance of the food supply. The species occurs, in small numbers at\r\nleast, more or less irregularly in winter even in the northern portions\r\nof its range. There is, however, usually a general southward movement\r\nin fall, which greatly increases its abundance in the Southern States\r\nin winter. William H. Fisher (1897) says of its winter occurrence in\r\nMaryland: “I have only met with about half a dozen individuals outside\r\nof Somerset County, but there, for the last fourteen years, in either\r\nNovember, December or January, I have found them to be very abundant.\r\nAccording to my observations, they prefer the low, swampy woodlands and\r\nclearings, only occasionally being found in the isolated tree in the\r\nfield.”\r\n\r\nW. E. Saunders tells me that it was formerly quite common in southern\r\nOntario and came regularly to the feeding stations in winter; evidently\r\nsome of these birds did not migrate. On the other hand, Audubon (1842)\r\nsays: “In winter I have found the red-bellied woodpecker the most\r\nabundant of all in the pine barrens of the Floridas, and especially\r\non the plantations bordering the St. John’s river, where on any day\r\nit would have been easy to procure half a hundred.” And C. J. Maynard\r\n(1896) writes: “I found the red-bellied woodpeckers quite abundant\r\nin winter in the piney woods which border the plantations on the Sea\r\nIslands off the Carolinas but as I proceeded south, their numbers\r\nincreased and in Florida, they fairly swarmed, actually occurring in\r\nflocks. They accompany the cockaded woodpeckers in the piney woods and\r\nalso associate with the yellow-bellies in the swamps and hummocks;\r\nin fact, it is difficult to remain long in any portion of Florida\r\nwhere there are trees, without hearing the discordant croak of these\r\nwoodpeckers and I even found them on the Keys.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Chiefly the Eastern United States, casual west to Arizona and\r\nColorado; nonmigratory.\r\n\r\nThe range of the red-bellied woodpecker extends =north= to southeastern\r\nNebraska (Lincoln and Nebraska City); southeastern Minnesota (St.\r\nPeter and Minneapolis); southern Michigan (Grand Rapids, Howell,\r\nand Plymouth); and southern Ontario (Coldstream, Toronto, and Twin\r\nLakes). =East= to southeastern Ontario (Twin Lakes); western New York\r\n(Canandaigua, Potter, and probably Ithaca); southern Pennsylvania\r\n(Fulton County); eastern Maryland (Marydel and Church Creek); Virginia\r\n(Dismal Swamp); North Carolina (Mattamuskeet Lake and Orton); South\r\nCarolina (Columbia and Frogmore); Georgia (Savannah, Cumberland Island,\r\nand Blackbeard Island); and Florida (New Smyrna, Eldred, Cape Florida,\r\nand Upper Matecumbe Key). The =southern= limits extend westward along\r\nthe Gulf coast to eastern Texas (Giddings and Austin). =West= to\r\neastern Texas (Austin, Cameron, and Waco); Oklahoma (Caddo, Norman,\r\nand Arnett); eastern Kansas (Harper, Wichita, and Manhattan); and\r\nsoutheastern Nebraska (Lincoln).\r\n\r\nAlthough not a migratory species, there appears to be some retreat from\r\nthe northern parts of the range, particularly during severe winters.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--Red-bellied woodpeckers have been taken or observed\r\non numerous occasions in New Jersey and eastern New York (including\r\nLong Island). The northernmost records on the Atlantic seaboard are\r\nseveral from Massachusetts, among which are the following: Springfield,\r\nMay 13, 1863; Newton, November 25, 1880; Cohasset, May 28, 1881; and\r\nClinton, July 17, 1896. One was noted at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan,\r\non August 29, 1920; two were reported from Yankton, S. Dak., on April\r\n14, 1923; one was seen in Monroe Canyon, Sioux County, northwestern\r\nNebraska (date?); in Colorado, a specimen was taken at Fountain in 1873\r\nand another at Limon in May 1899, while one was seen at Greeley in 1895\r\nand another at Yuma on October 1, 2, and 3, 1906. According to Ridgway\r\n(1914), the species is “accidental in Arizona (Fort Grant),” but no\r\ninformation is available to indicate the authority for this statement.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--Alabama: 9 records, April 17 to July 11.\r\n  Florida: 20 records, April 10 to June 20; 10 records, April 16 to\r\n    May 13, indicating the height of the season.\r\n  Illinois: 8 records, April 1 to June 3.\r\n  Texas: 8 records, April 8 to July 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CENTURUS AURIFRONS (Wagler)\r\n\r\n                       GOLDEN-FRONTED WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe golden-fronted woodpecker is found, in suitable localities, from\r\ncentral Texas southward to the Valley of Mexico. It is not, however,\r\nevenly distributed, being common in certain regions that suit its\r\nrequirements and entirely absent from other types of surrounding\r\ncountry. For example, E. M. Hasbrouck (1889) says: “In the single\r\nlocality in Eastland County where they are found, they may be said to\r\nbe fairly common, but outside of an area of twenty-five square miles\r\nthey are unknown in the County. * * * This section of country presents\r\npeculiar characteristics; the timber is entirely of post-oak, and the\r\nground more or less thickly covered with ‘shinnery,’ and differs from\r\nthe surrounding country in that the tops of the trees were affected\r\nsome years ago with a blight, and now this entire area is one mass\r\nof dead-topped trees, and this is what apparently suits the present\r\nspecies.”\r\n\r\nGeorge F. Simmons (1925) says of its haunts in the Austin region:\r\n“Mesquite forests with large trees, and mesquite flats; partial to\r\nlarge timber near mesquite growth, particularly among post oak and\r\nmixed oaks on gravel uplands, and in pecan groves on open and semi-open\r\nbottoms.”\r\n\r\nD. B. Burrows (Bendire, 1895) says that, in Starr County, on the lower\r\nRio Grande, “the golden-fronted woodpecker is a common resident species\r\nin this locality, and much more abundant than Baird’s woodpecker, the\r\nonly other variety that I have found here. They may be found wherever\r\nthere is a growth of trees sufficiently large to afford nesting places,\r\nbut are most numerous in the river bottoms where there is a heavy\r\ngrowth of old mesquite timber.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Major Bendire (1895) writes: “Nidification commences\r\nsometimes in the latter part of March, but usually not much before the\r\nmiddle of April; both sexes assist in this labor, and it takes from\r\nsix to ten days to excavate a proper nesting site; both live and dead\r\ntrees are used for this purpose, as well as telegraph poles and fence\r\nposts; the holes are rarely over 12 inches deep, and are situated at\r\nno great distances from the ground, mostly from 6 to 25 feet up.”\r\nAs to its nesting in Starr County, he quotes from Mr. Burrows: “The\r\nnest is by preference made in the live trunks of large trees, usually\r\nthe mesquite, but sometimes in a dead stump or limb, the same cavity\r\nbeing used year after year, and it is quite a rare thing to see a\r\nfresh excavation. The nesting season begins in April, and most of the\r\nnests contain fresh eggs by May 10. I took a set of six eggs from a\r\ncavity in a live mesquite tree, the opening being but 2 feet 9 inches\r\nfrom the ground, but usually they are placed from 8 to 20 feet up.”\r\nAnd H. P. Attwater wrote to him that “near San Antonio, Texas, where\r\nthe golden-fronted woodpecker is a common resident, it nests in all\r\nkinds of tall live timber, pecan, oak, and large mesquite trees being\r\npreferred, but telegraph poles furnished favorite sites here also.\r\nA line running out of San Antonio to a ranch nine miles distant was\r\nalmost destroyed by these birds; they came from all sides, from far and\r\nnear, and made fresh holes every year, sometimes as many as five or six\r\nin a single pole. Here it also nests occasionally in artificial nesting\r\nsites, like bird boxes, etc., in yards and gardens.”\r\n\r\nMy only experience with the nesting habits of this woodpecker was in\r\nCameron County, Tex., where we found this noisy and conspicuous bird\r\nquite common in the trees about the ranches. On May 24, 1923, we found\r\ntwo nests quite near the buildings on a well-kept Mexican ranch and\r\ncollected two sets of four fresh eggs; one was about 8 feet up in an\r\nanaqua tree and the other about 12 feet from the ground in a willow.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The golden-fronted woodpecker lays four to seven eggs to a\r\nset, usually four or five. The eggs are pure white and vary from ovate\r\nto short or rounded-ovate, with very little or no gloss when fresh.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of 59 eggs average 25.82 by 19.50 millimeters; the\r\neggs showing the four extremes measure =28.45= by 20.07, 27.94 by\r\n=20.83=, =22.86= by 17.78, and 25.91 by =18.03= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Major Bendire (1895) says: “Incubation lasts about fourteen\r\ndays, and both sexes share this duty. * * * It is probable that two\r\nbroods are occasionally raised in a season, as there are sets of eggs\r\nin the collection taken in June, and two of these in the latter part\r\nof this month.” But Mr. Simmons (1925) says “probably only one brood.”\r\nBoth parents assist in the care of the young. In summer and fall the\r\nyoung may be seen traveling about with their parents in family parties,\r\nbut they separate before winter.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--Probably the young are hatched naked and blind, as with\r\nother woodpeckers, and the juvenal plumage is acquired before the young\r\nbird leaves the nest. The young male, in juvenal plumage, is similar to\r\nthe adult male but is everywhere duller, with the markings less clearly\r\ndefined; the red crown patch is smaller and consists of somewhat\r\nscattered red feathers; there is usually more or less indistinct dusky\r\nbarring on the forehead, which is duller yellow than in the adult; the\r\nyellow of the hind neck is paler and duller; the chest is usually more\r\nor less streaked with dusky, and the yellow on the abdomen is paler.\r\nThe young female is similar to the young male but without any red on\r\nthe head, the yellow band on the hind neck paler, and the under parts\r\nall paler. This juvenal plumage is apparently worn all through fall\r\nand early winter; I have seen it as late as January 5; but probably a\r\nprotracted molt during fall and winter produces a gradual change into a\r\nplumage that is practically adult. Adults have a complete postnuptial\r\nmolt late in summer and fall, mainly in August and September, according\r\nto what few molting specimens I have seen.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Bendire (1895) says: “Their food consists of insects of\r\nvarious kinds, such as beetles, ants, grasshoppers, also larvae,\r\nacorns, Indian corn, and different kinds of wild berries and fruit.\r\nConsidered from an economic point of view, this woodpecker certainly\r\ndoes more good than harm, and the only thing that can be said against\r\nit is that in certain localities where it is common it may make itself\r\nmore or less of a nuisance by injuring telegraph poles.” In this\r\nconnection, George B. Sennett (1879) makes the following interesting\r\nremark: “The numerous holes which I observed the previous season in the\r\ntelegraph poles, and which I inferred might be nests of Woodpeckers, I\r\nfound to be excavations made by the birds in search of a large species\r\nof borer that works in the dry wood.”\r\n\r\nRoy W. Quillin writes to me that “this species has an odd habit of\r\nplacing shelled mesquite beans in the nesting holes. I have not yet\r\nfound any reason for this which seemed plausible.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--In general habits and behavior, the golden-fronted\r\nwoodpecker is much like the red-bellied woodpecker, to which it\r\nis closely related; and it reminded me also of our more familiar\r\nred-headed woodpecker. It is a lively, active, noisy bird, being much\r\nin evidence wherever it is found. It loves to perch for many minutes in\r\nthe dead top of some tall tree or on some telegraph or telephone pole,\r\nwhere it can obtain a good outlook. Mr. Burrows (Bendire, 1895) says:\r\n“During the fall and winter they may be found traveling about from\r\nplace to place in pairs, and are easily located by the call note, which\r\nsomewhat resembles that of the red-bellied woodpecker, the habits of\r\nthe two birds being in many respects quite similar. In the spring, when\r\nnesting, they become very noisy, and when approached, utter their alarm\r\nnote with great vigor. I have never known this species to drum on a\r\ndead limb, as most of the other woodpeckers do. When searching for food\r\nthey may be seen very diligently at work near the base of old trees,\r\namong the thick bushes, or even on the ground.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Mr. Simmons (1925) says that this bird is “extremely\r\nnoisy,” and describes its notes as “a harsh, rapid, scolding\r\n_chuh-chuh-chuh-chuh-chuh-chuh-chuh_; a metallic _whah-whah_; a loud,\r\nlong-drawn _sk-k-k-k-ah-er-r-r-r_ or _tcher-r-r-r_, _tcher-r-r-r_; a\r\nshort _check_, _check-check_. Both this species and the red-bellied\r\nwoodpecker have the same _chow_, _chow_, _chow_, _chow_ call; however,\r\nthere is a striking difference in the tone; the call of the Red-bellied\r\nWoodpecker may be imitated by completely filling the mouth with air and\r\nkeeping the lips pushed well forward, while that of the golden-fronted\r\nwoodpecker--_choogh-choogh_--is best given by pulling the lips back\r\ntightly, tautening the vocal cords, and making a hoarse, croupy noise\r\nin the throat, since the bird at times sounds as if it had a bad cold.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hasbrouck (1889) writes: “Their note is peculiar, combining the\r\n‘chirp, chirp’ of _carolinus_ with a certain shrillness and accent of\r\ntheir own, while the call note, either flying or at rest, is similar\r\nto that of _M. erythrocephalus_ and at the same time not unlike that\r\nof _Colaptes auratus_. While their notes once learned are readily\r\nrecognized, still it takes not a little practice to distinguish between\r\na red-head in one tree and the gold-front in the next, or between a\r\ngold-front and a flicker when both are on the opposite side of a ravine\r\nand hidden from view; and I have more than once shot _carolinus_ even\r\nwhen morally certain it was what I wanted.”\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The golden-fronted woodpecker might easily be confused\r\nwith the red-bellied woodpecker, for they are often found in the same\r\ngeneral region, and both have the back and wings barred with black and\r\nwhite; but all the lower part of the rump is white, instead of barred,\r\nin the golden-fronted and the gray under parts are tinged with yellow,\r\ninstead of red; the male red-bellied has the whole upper part of the\r\nhead, from forehead to hind neck, bright scarlet, and the female has an\r\nextensive patch of red on the posterior half of the upper head; whereas\r\nthe male golden-fronted has a much smaller patch of red on the crown,\r\na yellow forehead, and an orange-yellow band on the hind neck; and the\r\nfemale golden-fronted has no red on the head at all. The voice is said\r\nto be more distinctive than the color pattern.\r\n\r\n_Enemies._--Mr. Quillin writes to me: “While this species is still\r\nfairly abundant in southern Texas, it was much more plentiful ten or\r\nmore years ago. Because of the damage the birds wrought to telephone\r\nand telegraph poles, the various concerns owning such property secured\r\npassage of a law placing all woodpeckers on the unprotected list.\r\nThis done, they gave section crews of the railroads shotguns, and the\r\nkilling was on in earnest. Hunters and others helped, and the result\r\nhas been a marked decrease in the ranks of this species. The killing,\r\nor controlling still continues. However, pressure is now being brought\r\nto place the birds back on the protected list, and this will be done\r\nsooner or later. There is no getting around the fact that the birds did\r\ncause considerable damage. In this species we have a woodpecker which\r\nfor centuries had been pecking into hard mesquite trees. Along came the\r\nsoft pine poles and these same birds immediately literally ate them\r\nup. I have seen 16 holes, three of which were deep enough for nesting\r\nsites, in one small pole, not over 10 inches in diameter.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North-central Texas south to Central Mexico; nonmigratory.\r\n\r\nThe golden-fronted woodpecker ranges =north= to central Texas (San\r\nAngelo and Dallas). =East= to Texas (Dallas, Giddings, Cuero, Corpus\r\nChristi, and Brownsville); Tamaulipas (Matamoros, San Fernando, Ciudad\r\nVictoria, and Tampico); southeastern San Luis Potosi (Valles); Hidalgo\r\n(Ixmiquilipam and Tula); and the Federal District of Mexico (near\r\nMexico City). =South= to the Federal District of Mexico (near Mexico\r\nCity); Michoacan (Querendero, Morelia, and Patzcuaro); and Jalisco\r\n(Ocotlan and Guadalajara). =West= to Jalisco (Guadalajara); Zacatecas\r\n(Calvillo, Aguas Calientes, and Chicalote); northwestern Durango\r\n(Boquilla, Sestin, and Rosario); eastern Chihuahua (Julimes); and\r\ncentral Texas (Eagle Pass, Fort Clark, Kerrville, and San Angelo).\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--Texas: 66 records, March 30 to June 29; 33 records,\r\n    April 24 to May 17, indicating the height of the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                CENTURUS UROPYGIALIS UROPYGIALIS Baird\r\n\r\n                            GILA WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n                             PLATES 32-34\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nIn the desert regions of our southwestern borders, this gay little\r\nwoodpecker is one of the commonest, noisiest, and most conspicuous\r\nbirds, always much in evidence, and always seeming to protest, in\r\nwhining tones, the intrusion of strangers. Its center of abundance\r\nseems to be on the great desert mesas of southern Arizona, where the\r\ninfertile soil is scantily covered with a scattered growth of creosote\r\nbushes, low mesquites, an occasional cholla or barrel cactus and\r\ndotted with single specimens or little groups of the giant cactus, or\r\nsaguaro. But it is also common in the river bottoms, covered with a\r\nheavier growth of mesquite, and in the canyons of the foothills among\r\nthe cottonwoods, willows, and sycamores. It ranges from an elevation of\r\n2,500 feet on the mesas up to 4,000, or even 4,500, feet in the canyons\r\nand foothills.\r\n\r\nIn this region, it is a dominant species and a very useful neighbor,\r\neven if unintentionally, for the many species of birds and small\r\nmammals for which it provides homes. M. French Gilman (1915) puts it\r\nvery well as follows:\r\n\r\n     Were it not for the Gila woodpecker (_Centurus\r\n     uropygialis_) what would become of the several species\r\n     of birds that use already prepared cavities for their\r\n     domiciles? In some cases these tenants do not even\r\n     await the pleasure of the excavators, but take forcible\r\n     possession. In holes excavated by Gila woodpeckers there\r\n     may regularly be found nesting the elf owl, ferruginous\r\n     pigmy owl, ash-throated flycatcher, and Arizona crested\r\n     flycatcher. Occasionally a cactus wren makes use of the\r\n     handy hollow, and once I saw one occupied by a Lucy\r\n     warbler. A big “rough-neck” scaly lizard frequents the\r\n     holes when not too high in the cactus, and in two holes in\r\n     willow trees I found snakes. It is not pleasant to insert\r\n     one’s hand and have a big lizard or snake crawl up the\r\n     arm to escape. Rats and mice are sometimes found in the\r\n     deserted holes, especially if the tree be much decayed\r\n     and with cracks and hollows connecting holes at different\r\n     heights in the tree or branch. So these woodpeckers may be\r\n     considered among the class of innocent or unintentional\r\n     benefactors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the species mentioned by Mr. Gilman above, we found\r\nsaguaro screech owls, desert sparrow hawks, and western martins\r\nnesting in the old holes made by woodpeckers. Some of these holes were\r\ndoubtless made by Mearns’s gilded flickers, perhaps those that were\r\nused by the larger species, as this woodpecker is fairly common in\r\nthe same region and nests regularly in the saguaros. These old holes\r\nmake ideal nesting sites, for the sap of the cactus hardens around the\r\nexcavations, making them fairly permanent nesting boxes; I have seen\r\nthese gourd-shaped pockets still persisting in fallen saguaros, where\r\nthe pulp had all rotted away, leaving only the skeleton ribs of the\r\ndead giant.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--While collecting with the late Frank C. Willard in\r\nsouthern Arizona in 1922, we examined seven occupied nests of the Gila\r\nwoodpecker. The first of these was found on May 17, at Fairbank, in the\r\nvalley of the San Pedro River; the nest was a cavity 15 inches deep\r\nin a dead branch of a cottonwood, 15 feet above ground. Five days,\r\nMay 19 to 23, were spent in Pima County, in the vicinity of Tucson,\r\nbetween the mesquite forest in the valley of the Santa Cruz River and\r\nthe southern end of the Santa Catalina Mountains. Two nests were found\r\nin the mesquite forest on May 19, both in mesquite trees, one 20 and\r\none 25 feet from the ground; one contained only a single fresh egg and\r\nthe other held a brood of young. We had an interesting experience here\r\nthe next day. While crossing the forest, I saw a Gila woodpecker fly\r\nout from what I supposed was its nesting hole, about 15 feet up in a\r\nmesquite stub; the bird made such a great fuss about it that I felt\r\nsure that we had a set of woodpecker’s eggs within easy reach, and I\r\ncalled Mr. Willard to investigate it. He climbed the stub and chopped\r\nout the hole, while the woodpecker was flying about, scolding us and\r\nshowing the greatest concern. But, much to our surprise, he pulled out\r\nan elf owl and three unmistakable elf owl’s eggs. I killed the owl\r\nand shot the woodpecker, which still seemed much interested; and, on\r\nskinning and sexing both specimens, I found that the woodpecker was a\r\nmale and the owl a female. We were naturally much puzzled to figure out\r\nthe relationship between the two birds and their interest in the nest.\r\nBut, since reading Mr. Gilman’s remarks, quoted above, that sometimes\r\nthe woodpecker’s tenants “do not even await the pleasure of the\r\nexcavators, but take forcible possession,” it has occurred to me that\r\nprobably this was a case in point. The owl may have appropriated the\r\nfinished burrow of the woodpecker, and the latter was trying to evict\r\nan unwelcome tenant.\r\n\r\nThe remaining four nests found in this vicinity, and one found by\r\nMr. Willard on June 11, were all in saguaros on the desert mesa; the\r\nheights from the ground varied from 16 to 20 feet; and the cavities\r\nvaried in depths from 15 to 20 inches; there was one set of five eggs,\r\ntwo nests held four and one three eggs; and in one nest were two young\r\nand an addled egg.\r\n\r\nReferring to the nesting habits of this woodpecker in the vicinity of\r\nthe Gila River, in Arizona, Mr. Gilman (1915) writes:\r\n\r\n     Nesting sites in this locality are restricted to giant\r\n     cactus (_Cereus giganteus_), cottonwood and willow, as they\r\n     are the only suitable material for a nest excavation. More\r\n     nests are found in the giant cactus, as these plants are\r\n     more numerous than the others, and more “peckable,” though\r\n     the willows and cottonwoods along the river and the canals\r\n     are well patronized when sufficiently decayed. Of the nests\r\n     I examined I should say that fifty per cent were in the\r\n     cactus, and the rest equally divided between the other\r\n     trees mentioned. * * *\r\n\r\n     As to the size of the holes in the cactus as compared with\r\n     those in cottonwood and willow, I found no appreciable\r\n     difference. I expected the holes in the cactus to average\r\n     a little larger owing to possible greater ease in\r\n     excavating but the difference was too slight to be sure\r\n     of in measuring. Of eighteen holes measured, the average\r\n     diameter was 1.95 inches; the largest was 2.25 inches and\r\n     the smallest 1.87 inches. The deepest hole was 16 inches,\r\n     with the entrance 2 inches in diameter. The shallowest one\r\n     was 9 inches, with entrance a little less than 2 inches in\r\n     diameter. The average depth of holes measured was a little\r\n     more than 12 inches. Many of the holes were not exactly\r\n     circular, there being a difference of from ⅛ to nearly ½\r\n     inch between the long and short diameter if it be allowable\r\n     to use the term in that way. Usually the nest hole runs\r\n     straight in for a short distance before turning downward,\r\n     the distance seemingly depending on the texture of the\r\n     wood. In one case the hole went straight back for nine\r\n     inches before turning downward. It was in a big cottonwood\r\n     stump, and the bird excavated horizontally until decayed\r\n     wood was reached, when the hole turned downward. This was\r\n     an extreme case, as the depth horizontally is usually about\r\n     three inches. In the giant cactus it varies according to\r\n     the diameter of the trunk, the smaller the trunk the less\r\n     distance before turning downward. * * *\r\n\r\n     The same nest hole is used more than one season, both in\r\n     cactus and other locations. In 1913 I found a nest in a\r\n     big cottonwood stump containing young. The next year it\r\n     had young again, and I cut into it to measure the hole and\r\n     count them.\r\n\r\nFrank C. Willard (1912) says: “I think it is their habit to dig fresh\r\nholes after raising their brood of young. These fresh holes are not\r\noccupied that year but are made use of the next year when the sap has\r\nhad a chance to dry and form the hard lining which coats the inside of\r\nall the cavities. I have found but one fresh hole occupied as a nest.”\r\nBendire (1895) also says that “most of their nesting sites are used for\r\nseveral years in succession; in fact, I doubt very much if a freshly\r\nexcavated hole in a giant cactus is fit to nest in the same season.\r\nBoth sexes assist in excavating the nesting site.”\r\n\r\nIn the heavily incrusted nest cavity in a giant cactus, the eggs lie\r\non the bare, hard floor of the nest, there being no chips to furnish a\r\nsoft bed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the trees mentioned above, the Gila woodpecker has been\r\nfound nesting more rarely in oaks and palo-verdes.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The Gila woodpecker lays three to five eggs, three or four\r\nbeing much oftener found than five. The eggs are pure white and\r\nnot very glossy when fresh, but sometimes quite glossy when heavily\r\nincubated; they vary from ovate to elliptical-ovate and are sometimes\r\nquite pointed. The measurements of 52 eggs average 25.14 by 18.56\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =27.43= by\r\n18.80, 26.6 by =20.1=, =22.86= by 17.27, and 23.9 by =16.6= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Incubation is said to last about two weeks, and is probably\r\nshared by both parents. Mr. Gilman (1915) writes:\r\n\r\n     It is not easy to determine just what food the young in\r\n     the nest are given, but insects play a prominent part, as\r\n     I have seen them frequently carried to the young. Fruit\r\n     is also used, as I watched one parent carry ripe Lycium\r\n     berries several times to the nest; after emerging from the\r\n     hole she would halt at the entrance each time and “lick her\r\n     chops.” * * *\r\n\r\n     The young are fed by the parents for a long time after\r\n     leaving the nest, and they are regular little beggars. One\r\n     pair stayed around our house for several months, and became\r\n     quite tame. They were missed during the breeding season\r\n     but soon came back with three youngsters to share the good\r\n     things found on the bird tables in the yard. The young,\r\n     though as large as their parents, would flutter their\r\n     wings and sit with open beak as though the old ones told\r\n     them to “open your mouth and shut your eyes,” etc. The old\r\n     ones would try to get them to eat watermelon placed on the\r\n     tables, but the babies would not be shown; the parents had\r\n     to put it in their mouths. They followed the parents from\r\n     perch to perch, begging for food until I expected to see\r\n     them chastised. The pair in question stayed with the three\r\n     juvenals until they had them broken to eat for themselves,\r\n     and then left. After a proper interval they came back with\r\n     two more young ones, thus indicating that a second brood is\r\n     sometimes raised. The abundant supply of food may have been\r\n     a determining factor in the number of broods raised.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The nestlings are naked and blind at first but become\r\nfully clothed in the juvenal plumage before leaving the nest. The young\r\nmale, in juvenal plumage, is much like the adult male, but the colors\r\nare generally paler, the head and under parts grayer, the barring on\r\nthe upper parts less distinct, and the white bars are suffused with\r\nbrownish buff; the red patch on the crown is smaller and often consists\r\nof only a few red feathers; and the bill is somewhat smaller and\r\nweaker. The young female is like the young male but has no red on the\r\nhead. I have been unable to trace the postjuvenal molt, but young birds\r\nin the following spring are apparently like the adults. Adults have a\r\ncomplete postnuptial molt in August, September, and October.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Major Bendire (1895) says: “Its food consists of insects of\r\nvarious kinds, such as ants, beetles, grasshoppers, and larvæ, and in\r\nseason largely on the sweet, fig-like fruit of the sahuaras, the giant\r\ncactus, and also, to a considerable extent, on the viscous berries of\r\na species of mistletoe which is commonly found on most of the larger\r\ncottonwoods, oaks, and mesquite trees in these regions. These sticky,\r\nwhitish-looking berries are a favorite food of many Arizona birds.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gilman (1915) writes:\r\n\r\n     The food, of this woodpecker is varied, nearly everything\r\n     being grist that comes to his mill. He pecks around decayed\r\n     and dying trees as well as green ones, and presumably get\r\n     the insects usually found and eaten by such birds. The\r\n     giant cactus is pecked into very frequently, and I believe\r\n     some of the pulp is eaten. The small punctures made are not\r\n     enlarged, and in some cases quite an area is bitten into.\r\n     The fruit of the giant cactus is eaten as long as it lasts,\r\n     and the berries of the Lycium are also freely eaten. The\r\n     Gila woodpecker frequents corn fields, and pecks through\r\n     the husks into the ears of corn. The birds may peck in\r\n     at first to get a worm, but it is a case similar to the\r\n     discovery of roast pig as portrayed by Lamb. They alight on\r\n     the ground and feed upon table scraps thrown to chickens,\r\n     three of them being regular morning visitors, star\r\n     boarders, to a pen of chickens I fed. They are very fond of\r\n     peaches and pears, and volubly resent being driven from a\r\n     tree of the fruit. They peck holes in ripening pomegranates\r\n     and then the green fruit beetle helps finish the fruit They\r\n     relish grapes, both white and colored, and will spear one\r\n     with their bill and carry it to a convenient crevice where\r\n     it may be eaten at leisure. On bird tables I have tried\r\n     them with various articles of food and found very little\r\n     that they rejected. They would not eat cantaloupe at all\r\n     but were regular watermelon fiends, eating it three times\r\n     a day and calling for more. They did not care for oranges,\r\n     and I had no success in trying to teach them to eat ripe\r\n     pickled olives. I tried the olive diet on them because two\r\n     Mocking-birds in our yard learned to eat this fruit. Meat,\r\n     raw and cooked, was eaten, and they ate suet greedily.\r\n     Their favorite cut of beef was the T-bone steak and we\r\n     always left some meat on the bone for them. They picked it\r\n     clean, and if a new supply was slow in coming the softer\r\n     parts of the bone were devoured. * * * Mr. Frank Pinkley,\r\n     custodian of the Casa Grande Ruins told me of a pair of\r\n     these woodpeckers that stayed around his home and became\r\n     quite tame, coming into the shed to drink from a can of\r\n     water. He said they got into the habit of sucking the eggs\r\n     in the chicken house, or at least pecking into them and\r\n     eating of the contents. * * *\r\n\r\n     The Indians store corn in the ear on the flat tops of their\r\n     houses and sheds, * * * and each home has one or more of\r\n     woodpecker retainers or pensioners hanging about most of\r\n     the time. This corn provides an abundant and sure source\r\n     of food, and the birds make the most of it. I have never\r\n     seen any indication of food-storage on the part of the Gila\r\n     woodpecker, as with the California Woodpecker, for they\r\n     live in a claw-to-beak fashion. They peck at a kernel until\r\n     it comes off the cob, when it is carried to a post or tree\r\n     and placed firmly in a crack. Here it is pecked to pieces\r\n     and eaten. They seem never to swallow a kernel whole but\r\n     always break it up.\r\n\r\nW. L. Dawson (1923) says that this woodpecker indulges in “a systematic\r\nsearch for birds’ eggs, especially those of the Lucy warbler, yellow\r\nwarbler, and Arizona Least Vireo. In case of the first-named, the\r\neggs are devoured in spite of the most emphatic protests of the tiny\r\nparents; but eggs of Cardinal, Cooper Tanager and Towhee must be\r\nobtained by stealth.”\r\n\r\nA. H. Anderson (1934) writes:\r\n\r\n     In the Tucson, Arizona, area a gall-insect (_Pachypsylla\r\n     venusta_) frequently attacks the leaves of the hackberry\r\n     tree (_Celtis reticulata_). The galls form on the leaf\r\n     petiole, becoming from a quarter to half an inch in\r\n     diameter. During the winter the outer shell hardens like a\r\n     nut.\r\n\r\n     I have often seen the Gila woodpeckers tear the galls loose\r\n     from the twigs and, flying to a fence post, proceed to\r\n     chisel out the contents. The hard gall is wedged into a\r\n     crack on the post and then opened by repeated hammering.\r\n     Around the base of one fence post I counted nearly 300\r\n     empty shells. Sometimes cracks in nearby trees are used. At\r\n     one time five of these woodpeckers were seen in a single\r\n     tree, all of them feeding on the galls.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The Gila woodpecker is not only the most abundant\r\nwoodpecker, in fact one of the most abundant birds, in the region it\r\ninhabits, but it is more conspicuous, noisier, and more active than\r\nany of its neighbors. It is always much in evidence, always protesting\r\nthe intrusion of a stranger, and shows the greatest concern when\r\nits nest is approached, especially if it has young. It is a close\r\nsitter and will often remain in the nest hole to peck viciously at an\r\ninvestigating hand; while the nest is being robbed, it flits nervously\r\nabout, scolding vociferously with all the vile epithets it can muster.\r\nAs to its behavior with other species, Mr. Gilman (1915) writes:\r\n\r\n     This woodpecker has not the best disposition in the world,\r\n     for he is very quarrelsome and intolerant. He fights his\r\n     own kin and all the neighbors that he dares. He, or she,\r\n     is a great bluffer however and when “called”, frequently\r\n     side-steps, subsides, or backs out entirely. I saw one\r\n     approach a Bendire Thrasher that was eating, and suddenly\r\n     pounce on him. He had the thrasher down and I was thinking\r\n     of offering my friendly services as a board of arbitration,\r\n     when the under bird crawled from beneath and soon gave\r\n     the woodpecker the thrashing of his career. Several times\r\n     I have seen the woodpeckers start to attack Bendire and\r\n     Palmer thrashers, but they were always bluffed or beaten at\r\n     the game. With the Bronzed Cowbirds it is a drawn battle,\r\n     sometimes one and then the other backing down. Most other\r\n     birds, such as Cardinals, Abert Towhees, Dwarf Cowbirds and\r\n     Cactus Wrens do not attempt to assert their rights, but\r\n     always take a rear seat. But when it is woodpecker versus\r\n     woodpecker it seems not to be a case of “Thrice armed is he\r\n     who hath his quarrel just”, but rather, “Four times he who\r\n     gets his blow in fust”.\r\n\r\n     I had two bird tables about twenty feet apart, and\r\n     frequently one woodpecker might be peacefully assimilating\r\n     watermelon, when another one would come hurrying up and\r\n     make a dive at him, causing a retreat to the other table.\r\n     Frequently the new-comer would then follow and drive him\r\n     from the second table. He seemingly would rather fight than\r\n     eat if another was eating at the same time. One day I saw\r\n     him, or her, I forget which, hanging to the edge of the\r\n     table busily eating steak, when another one perched on the\r\n     table and made a vicious stab at him. He dodged backward\r\n     clear under the table, though retaining his hold, and then\r\n     bobbed up again, just like the Punch and Judy show. The\r\n     attack was renewed, and the dodging as well, but this time\r\n     he did not “come back”. Another day one of them was at\r\n     work on a piece of melon when one of his fellows came and\r\n     perched on the end of the table. The diner made a pass at\r\n     the new comer, and seizing him by the feathers of the neck\r\n     held him suspended over the end of the table for a few\r\n     seconds.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--Major Bendire (1895) says: “Its ordinary call note, sounding\r\nlike ‘dchürr, dchürr,’ can be heard in all directions in the spring;\r\nwhen flying from one point to another it usually utters a sharp, shrill\r\n‘huit’ two or three times, resembling the common call note of the\r\nPhainopepla, and which may readily be mistaken for it. It is also more\r\nor less addicted to drumming on the dead tops of cottonwood, sycamore,\r\nand mesquite trees.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gilman (1915) writes:\r\n\r\n     As a neighbor, the Gila Woodpecker is permanently on the\r\n     map, and is afraid neither of being seen nor heard. He is\r\n     much in the public ear with a variety of notes and calls.\r\n     His sociable conversational notes somewhat resemble those\r\n     of the California Woodpecker but are shriller. In such of\r\n     his notes as are directed at humanity there is a peevish\r\n     complaining tone, especially if closely approached when\r\n     feeding on fruit or some other delicacy. In such cases\r\n     there is only one term that exactly describes his attitude\r\n     and utterances, and that is the phrase “belly-aching.”\r\n     In fact all of his talk at us has a distinctly “colicky”\r\n     tone and one feels like giving him something to whine\r\n     about. His ordinary call slightly resembles that of the\r\n     Flicker but is not quite so loud; altogether he is quite a\r\n     conversationalist.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The Gila woodpecker should be easily recognized as a\r\nmedium-sized woodpecker, about the size of a hairy woodpecker, with a\r\ngrayish-brown head, neck, and under parts and a back narrowly barred\r\nwith black and white; in flight a white patch shows in the wing and\r\nbasal half of the primaries, and the black and white barring on the\r\ncentral tail feathers is rather conspicuous; the red crown patch of the\r\nmale is conspicuous only at short range.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--This woodpecker is apparently somewhat given to wandering in\r\nfall and spring, for W. E. D. Scott (1886) says that he does not see it\r\nabout his house, at an elevation of 4,500 feet in Pinal County, Ariz.,\r\nin summer, but that it is rather common there in fall and spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Southwestern United States and western Mexico; nonmigratory.\r\n\r\nThe range of the Gila woodpecker extends =north= to extreme southern\r\nNevada (Clark County); southern Arizona (Sacaton, Rock Canyon, and\r\nTombstone); and southwestern New Mexico (Red Rock and probably Gila).\r\n=East= to New Mexico (probably Gila); eastern Sonora (Fronteras, Boca\r\nde Huachy, and Nuri); southwestern Chihuahua (Batopilas); western\r\nDurango (Chacala); and western Zacatecas (Calvillo). =South= to\r\nsouthwestern Zacatecas (Calvillo); and Jalisco (Guadalajara, Santa\r\nAno, and Rio Ameca). =West= to Jalisco (Rio Ameca); Nayarit (Tepic and\r\nSan Blas); southwestern Sinaloa (Escuinapa, Labrados, and Mazatlan);\r\nBaja California (Cape San Lucas, Santa Margarita Island, San Ignacio,\r\nRosario, San Quintin, Las Palmas, and the Alamo River); southeastern\r\nCalifornia (Calexico, probably Brawley, Palo Verde, and Needles); and\r\nsouthern Nevada (Clark County).\r\n\r\nThis species has been separated into three geographic races, or\r\nsubspecies. Typical _C. u. uropygialis_ is the form found in that part\r\nof the range lying in the United States, and this race also is the one\r\nfound in the western mainland of Mexico. The cardon woodpecker (_C. u.\r\ncardonensis_) is found in the northern part of Baja California south\r\nto about latitude 28° N. Brewster’s woodpecker (_C. u. brewsteri_)\r\noccupies the cape district of Baja California north to San Ignacio and\r\nincluding also Santa Margarita Island.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--Arizona: 26 records, April 7 to May 30; 13 records,\r\n    May 5 to 25, indicating the height of the season.\r\n  Baja California: 10 records, April 21 to June 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               CENTURUS UROPYGIALIS CARDONENSIS Grinnell\r\n\r\n                           CARDON WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nIn describing and naming this race, Dr. Joseph Grinnell (1927a) says:\r\n\r\n     In its main characters similar to _Centurus uropygialis\r\n     uropygialis_, but general coloration much darker: whole\r\n     head (except for red patch on crown) and anterior lower\r\n     surface strongly tinged with snuff brown rather than pale\r\n     drab; and white barring on closed wings, tail, dorsum,\r\n     rump, flanks, and lower tail coverts, narrower, leaving\r\n     the black-barring correspondingly broader. Similar to _C.\r\n     u. brewsteri_, but size larger, and coloration darker, in\r\n     the same respects though not to quite so great a degree as\r\n     shown in comparison with _uropygialis_. In other words, the\r\n     new form differs from both the previously known races in\r\n     the deeper brown tinge of the head and lower surface and in\r\n     the greater degree of predominance of black over white in\r\n     the barring.\r\n\r\nHe says of its range: “So far as now known, only the giant cactus\r\n(cardon) association in the northern section of the Lower Californian\r\npeninsula, from about latitude 30° to latitude 31°. Life-zone, Lower\r\nSonoran.” The 1931 Check-list extends the range northward “along the\r\nwestern rim of the Colorado Desert to about latitude 32°.”\r\n\r\nA. W. Anthony (1895a) says of the haunts of this woodpecker in Baja\r\nCalifornia: “The range of this species along the Pacific slope is\r\nexactly coextensive with that of _Cereus pringlei_, becoming common\r\nwith that cactus a short distance below Rosario and seldom if ever\r\nbeing seen at any distance from the shelter of its mighty branches. At\r\nthe mission, where the cardons were very large and abundant, to within\r\na short distance of the mesquite thickets, this Woodpecker delighted\r\nin making frequent forays into the lesser growth, spending hours in\r\nhammering on the mesquite trunks and hunting through their branches,\r\nalways beating a precipitate retreat to the cactus on the hillsides\r\nabove at the first sign of danger.”\r\n\r\nI can find nothing further of consequence published on the habits of\r\nthe cardon woodpecker, which doubtless do not differ materially from\r\nthose of its Arizona relative.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are similar to those of the Gila woodpecker. The measurements\r\nof 11 eggs average 23.59 by 18.30 millimeters; the eggs showing the\r\nfour extremes measure =25.6= by 18.1, 24.5 by =19.8=, =21.9= by 17.8,\r\nand 22.1 by =17.3= millimeters. Griffing Bancroft has a still larger\r\negg, which measures 26.4 by 21.8 millimeters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                CENTURUS UROPYGIALIS BREWSTERI Ridgway\r\n\r\n                         BREWSTER’S WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nIn the Cape region of Baja California, we find this local race, which\r\nRidgway (1914) describes as “similar to _C. u. uropygialis_ but\r\nsmaller, with relatively (often absolutely) larger bill, bars on back,\r\netc., averaging decidedly narrower (the white ones about 1.5-2 mm.\r\nwide), black bars on lower rump and upper tail-coverts narrower or more\r\nnumerous, and white bars on lateral rectrices as well as black ones on\r\ninner web of middle rectrices narrower.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Brewster (1902) says: “In the Cape Region the Gila Woodpecker\r\nhas apparently much the same distribution as _Dryobates lucasanus_.\r\nNeither Mr. Belding nor Mr. Frazar found it in the higher mountains,\r\nbut both note its abundance throughout the low country, and Mr. Frazar\r\nobtained many specimens at Triunfo which is within the lower edge of\r\nthe oak belt.”\r\n\r\nGriffing Bancroft (1930) referred the woodpeckers of this species that\r\nhe found breeding in central Lower California to this southern race.\r\nProbably they are intermediate between this and _cardonensis_. He says\r\nof it:\r\n\r\n     The most abundant bird of its order, ranging throughout\r\n     the territory examined. It is to be found in the suburban\r\n     gardens of Santa Rosalia, among the palms of San Ignacio,\r\n     and everywhere through the desert cactus belt. Its favorite\r\n     choice of a home is a site high in a candelabra cardón; but\r\n     it will also nest, even when not driven by necessity, in\r\n     palms and tree yucca.\r\n\r\n     Its breeding season is quite long, fresh eggs being found\r\n     from the latter part of April until well into June. The\r\n     number laid is irregular. About half the sets are of two,\r\n     but there are four’s and even five’s. Sixteen eggs taken in\r\n     the vicinity of San Ignacio average 24.0 by 18.9 mm.\r\n\r\n     The birds are quite tame and often cannot be flushed. More\r\n     than once, on opening cavities, we have lifted an adult\r\n     from eggs or young, or even from an empty hole. Repeatedly\r\n     a bird has been seen flying into a nest, either to feed\r\n     young or to go onto eggs, while people were standing at\r\n     the foot of the tree. When their homes are being examined\r\n     the birds often approach within a few feet to voice their\r\n     protests. Such fearlessness is unusual on this desert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  COLAPTES AURATUS AURATUS (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\n                           SOUTHERN FLICKER\r\n\r\n                               PLATE 35\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe type name _auratus_ is now restricted to the flickers of the South\r\nAtlantic and Gulf States, from North Carolina to southern Florida\r\nand central Texas north to extreme southern Illinois and Indiana,\r\nsoutheastern Missouri, and southeastern Kansas, because the above\r\nLinnaean name was based on birds described by Catesby, which belonged\r\nto the smaller southern race.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the southern flicker are so similar to those of the\r\nnorthern flicker that the following account given for the northern race\r\nwill serve very well for both. It is a common bird, widely distributed\r\nand well known throughout its range. In Florida we found it rather\r\npartial to open, burned-over tracts in the flat pine woods, nesting\r\nin the charred stumps, but it was also common in more open country in\r\nthinly settled regions, where we often found it nesting in isolated\r\ntrees or dead stubs of palmettos or pines.\r\n\r\nW. J. Erichsen (1920) says of its haunts in Chatham County, Ga.:\r\n“Wherever there are areas of cut-over lands on which remain an\r\nabundance of dead trees this species will be found in large numbers.\r\nAt all seasons it exhibits a preference for open pine barrens, but,\r\nparticularly during the breeding season, is occasionally met with\r\nabout the edges of swamps if they contain suitable nesting sites. It\r\nis abundant on all of the wooded islands, particularly Ossabaw island,\r\nwhere I observed it in large numbers in May, 1915. Here it is oftenest\r\nseen in the woods close to the salt marsh or adjoining the beach,\r\napparently not frequenting in any numbers the more heavily forested\r\ninterior of the island.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Capt. H. L. Harllee writes to me that southern flickers\r\nraise two broods in a season in South Carolina and are not very\r\nparticular as to their nesting sites. They nest in holes of their\r\nown excavation in dead trees of many species, 3 to 100 feet from\r\nthe ground, either in thick woods or in a lone dead tree in an open\r\ncultivated field; they also nest in natural cavities in trees. He\r\nfound one pair of these birds nesting in a hole made by fire in an old\r\nburned-out stump; the cavity was about two feet deep and eight inches\r\nin diameter; “the opening was slightly arched over with grass growing\r\naround it; a small quantity of pine straw was the only lining.”\r\n\r\nArthur H. Howell (1932) says: “The nests are placed in pines, oaks,\r\ncabbage palms, or other trees, at heights varying from a few feet to\r\n60 feet above the ground. At Ponce Park, in May, 1925, I observed a\r\nFlicker using a hole in a palmetto pile under the dock on the shore\r\nof the Halifax River, only 2 feet above the salt water at high tide.\r\nNicholson found a nest 12 inches above the ground in a sawed-off stump\r\nof a palmetto on a ditch bank.”\r\n\r\nAlexander Sprunt, Jr. (1931), mentions a concentration of hole-nesting\r\nbirds in a tree in a yard in Beaufort, S. C.; the tree measured only 20\r\nfeet in height and contained nests of two pairs of flickers, and one\r\nnest each of crested flycatcher, screech owl, and downy woodpecker.\r\n“All five cavities were contained in a radius of ten feet, and four\r\nwere within six feet of each other.”\r\n\r\nA. F. Ganier (1926) writes:\r\n\r\n     While in the suburbs of Chattanooga, Tennessee, last\r\n     spring, I noticed a Flicker engaged in what appeared to\r\n     be a hopeless task in the way of nest excavation. An iron\r\n     water tank, supported by steel columns forty feet high,\r\n     was fed by a large iron pipe through its bottom, and, to\r\n     keep this pipe from freezing in winter, it had been encased\r\n     with a plank shaft two feet square that was filled with\r\n     cedar sawdust. Our friend _Colaptes auratus_ had evidently\r\n     sounded the boards, and, sensing easy digging, had drilled\r\n     a hole in the middle of one side about thirty feet up. When\r\n     espied, he was enthusiastically pitching out quantities of\r\n     sawdust, which I presume caved in about as fast as he dug,\r\n     but during the half hour I was engaged near by there was\r\n     no let up in the work. About a month later I was again in\r\n     the vicinity and made it a point to go by the tank. On the\r\n     ground below the hole was at least a bushel of sawdust, and\r\n     in a few minutes I had the pleasure of seeing a Flicker\r\n     enter the hole with food in its mouth, presumably to feed\r\n     the young that had come to reward his perseverance.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The southern flicker lays five to ten eggs, ordinarily, but\r\nshares with its northern relative its reputation as a prolific egg\r\nlayer; it will continue to lay again and again after being robbed,\r\nas many as 30 or 40 eggs and often three or four sets. The eggs\r\nare similar to those of the northern flicker, except for a slight\r\ndifference in size. The measurements of 44 eggs from South Carolina\r\naverage 28.57 by 22.01 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes\r\nmeasure =30.15= by =24.56= and =24.13= by =20.32= millimeters. These\r\nseem to run larger than eggs from farther north.\r\n\r\nIn all other respects, the habits of the southern flicker are similar\r\nto those of the species elsewhere, with due allowance for the\r\ndifference in environment. Two items of interest, however, are worth\r\nquoting. Charles R. Stockard (1904) writes from Mississippi:\r\n\r\n     On April 18 a burrow of a Flicker containing only one fresh\r\n     egg was found. The egg was not disturbed. When visiting\r\n     the nest again on April 28 a flying squirrel was found in\r\n     possession. On my arrival the bird was at the entrance of\r\n     the burrow peering in at the intruder. It was supposed that\r\n     the squirrel was eating the eggs, but on examining the nest\r\n     it was found to contain one spoilt egg. The squirrel had\r\n     then probably been in possession for the ten days since the\r\n     nest was observed, so the bird had been unable to enter and\r\n     lay. * * * The Flicker must then have remained about her\r\n     nest for this length of time, and as soon as the squirrel\r\n     was removed she again took charge. On visiting the nest\r\n     May 5, seven days later, it contained seven fresh eggs and\r\n     the old one that had been left. * * * This was undoubtedly\r\n     a case of discontinuous laying unless she had dropped her\r\n     eggs on the ground while the squirrel was occupying the\r\n     nest.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sanford Duncan (1932), of Nashville, Tenn., tells an interesting\r\nstory of a flicker that was captured by a bullsnake. She heard a great\r\ncommotion among the birds in her yard and went out to investigate\r\nthe cause of the excitement. “The Flickers were leading the battle,\r\ndashing and darting at a bundle of something on the ground. Closer\r\ninspection with field glasses showed it was a snake, all tied up in\r\na curious knot. He was too big for me to attack with the hoe I had,\r\nso I shot into the ‘bundle’ with a shotgun. As if by magic the snake\r\nflung himself into the air and fell, straightened out, over five feet\r\nlong, and disclosed a full-grown Flicker that he had wrapped himself\r\naround many times. The Flicker was still alive, but died very shortly,\r\nprobably from the gunshot that killed the bullsnake.”\r\n\r\nLester W. Smith writes to me that he watched a southern flicker digging\r\nwhite grubs out of a lawn and killing them by repeated blows and\r\nshaking; meantime a loggerhead shrike was attempting to rob the flicker\r\nof its prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--North America, chiefly east of the Rocky Mountains, and from\r\nthe limit of trees south to the Gulf coast.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The breeding range of the flicker extends =north=\r\nto Alaska (Circle); northwestern Mackenzie (probably Fort McPherson,\r\nFort Anderson, McVicar Bay, Fort Rae, and Hill Island Lake); northern\r\nSaskatchewan (Reindeer Lake); northern Manitoba (probably Lake Du\r\nBrochet and Fort Churchill); Ontario (Lac Seul and probably Moose\r\nFactory); Quebec (probably Fort George, probably Lake Mistassini,\r\nGodbout, and Mingan Island); and Labrador (Cartwright). From this\r\nnortheastern point the range extends =southward= through Newfoundland,\r\nalong the Atlantic coast to Key West, Fla. The =southern= limits of\r\nnesting are the Gulf coasts of Florida and Alabama, thence in the\r\ninterior to Louisiana (St. Francisville and Genoa); and Oklahoma\r\n(Okmulgee and Norman). =West= to Oklahoma (Norman); central Kansas\r\n(Harper, Hay, and Stockton); Nebraska (Red Cloud, Alda, and Chadron);\r\neastern Wyoming (Midwest and Newcastle); Montana (Terry, Fairview, and\r\nGreat Falls); Alberta (Morrin, Henry House, and Lesser Slave Lake);\r\nnorthwestern British Columbia (Telegraph Creek and Atlin); Yukon\r\n(Caribou Crossing and Selkirk); and eastern Alaska (Circle). This\r\nspecies, more or less crossed with the red-shafted flicker (_Colaptes\r\nc. collaris_), also is found occasionally in eastern Colorado\r\n(Hallvale, Denver, and Fort Morgan).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--During the winter season the flicker is found with\r\nmore or less regularity =north= to southeastern South Dakota (Yankton,\r\nVermillion, and Sioux Falls); southern Minnesota (Hutchinson and\r\nMinneapolis); southern Wisconsin (North Freedom and Milwaukee);\r\nsouthern Michigan (Kalamazoo, Jackson, Ann Arbor, and Detroit);\r\nsouthern Ontario (Plover Mills, Hamilton, and Toronto); New York\r\n(Rochester, Syracuse, and Rhinebeck); and rarely Maine (Waterville).\r\nFrom this point it is found =south= along the Atlantic coast to\r\nsouthern Florida (St. Lucie and Fort Myers). The southern limits of\r\nthe winter range are found on the Gulf coast from Florida (Fort Myers)\r\nto Texas (Brownsville). =West= to Texas (Brownsville, San Antonio,\r\nSan Angelo, and Abilene); central Oklahoma (Norman, Oklahoma City,\r\nand Tonkawa); Kansas (Wichita and rarely Hay); Nebraska (Red Cloud\r\nand North Loup); and southeastern South Dakota (Yankton). It also has\r\nbeen taken or observed at this season north to southern Saskatchewan\r\n(Eastend); Quebec (Montreal); New Brunswick (St. John); and Nova Scotia\r\n(Bridgetown).\r\n\r\nThe range as outlined is for the entire species, of which two\r\nsubspecies are currently recognized. The typical form, known as the\r\nsouthern flicker (_C. a. auratus_), is found from southern Florida and\r\nTexas north to southeastern Kansas, southeastern Missouri, southern\r\nIllinois and Indiana, and North Carolina. It probably is nonmigratory.\r\nThe rest of the range is occupied by the northern flicker (_C. a.\r\nluteus_).\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--Early dates of arrival in regions north of the\r\nwinter range as outlined, are: Nova Scotia--Wolfville, March 26;\r\nHalifax, April 7. New Brunswick--Scotch Lake, April 5; Grand Manan,\r\nApril 12. Quebec--Quebec City, April 27; Godbout, May 2; Paradise,\r\nJune 5. North Dakota--Fargo, March 29; Charlson, March 30; Grand\r\nForks, April 2. Manitoba--Winnipeg, March 30; Alexander, April 14;\r\nRaeburn, April 15. Saskatchewan--Eastend, April 3; McLean, April 3.\r\nWyoming--Cheyenne, April 7; Laramie, April 12. Montana--Great Falls,\r\nApril I; Terry, April 4; Jackson, April 14. Alberta--Banff, April 4;\r\nFlagstaff, April 13; Edmonton, April 17. Mackenzie--Fort Simpson, May\r\n4; Fort Reliance, May 2. Alaska--Fairbanks, April 25; Fort Yukon, May 1.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--Late dates of fall departure are: Alaska,--Wrangell,\r\nOctober 11; Craig, October 21. Mackenzie--near McVicar Bay, September\r\n10; Great Slave Lake, September 11; Fort Simpson, October 16.\r\nAlberta--Lac La Biche, September 25; Glenevis, October 2; Calgary,\r\nOctober 10. Montana--Bozeman, September 24; Saskatchewan--Eastend,\r\nOctober 14. Manitoba--Alexander, October 22; Aweme, October 27. North\r\nDakota--Arlington, October 19; Argusville, October 21; Fargo, October\r\n21. Northern Michigan--Sault Ste. Marie, October 24. Quebec--Montreal,\r\nNovember 25. New Brunswick--St. John, November 5; Scotch Lake, November\r\n22. Nova Scotia--Wolfville, November 19.\r\n\r\nThe records of flickers that have been banded and subsequently\r\nrecovered throw much light upon the migrations of this species. In\r\nthe files of the Biological Survey there are long series of cases\r\nwhere birds banded at their nests in the northern parts of the\r\nbreeding range (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Michigan, New York,\r\nand Massachusetts) have returned to the same point one to four years\r\nlater. These birds probably all belonged to the subspecies _luteus_.\r\nSimilarly, similar data also are available for areas (Missouri,\r\nKentucky, Tennessee, and Florida) within the range of _C. a. auratus_,\r\nwhich probably is nonmigratory.\r\n\r\nDefinite migrations of individual banded birds are indicated by the\r\nrecords of flickers banded in Saskatchewan and recovered in Iowa,\r\nOklahoma, and Texas; banded in Missouri and recovered in Texas;\r\nbanded in Iowa and recovered in Louisiana; banded in South Dakota\r\nand recovered in Arkansas and Oklahoma (4); banded in Illinois and\r\nrecovered in Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas (2), and Louisiana\r\n(3); banded in Indiana and recovered in Mississippi; banded in Michigan\r\nand recovered in Arkansas and Louisiana; banded in Ohio and recovered\r\nin Alabama and Mississippi; banded in Pennsylvania and recovered in\r\nGeorgia; and banded in Nova Scotia and recovered in North Carolina.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--In southern British Columbia a specimen was\r\ncollected at Sumas on April 8, 1903, and two were seen at Vernon on\r\nDecember 26, 1906; a specimen was taken at Orcas Island, Wash., on\r\nOctober 15, 1907; one was collected at Blaine, Oreg., on November 3,\r\n1921; and one was taken at Cliff Spring, Nev., on September 29, 1931.\r\nThere are several records for California as follows: Furnace Creek,\r\nApril 12, 1917; St. Geronimo, December 18, 1893, and January 14, 1895;\r\nPoint Lobos, December 14, 1934; Los Angeles, February 20, 1901; San\r\nDiego, December 4, 1931; and Eldridge, January 4, 1913.\r\n\r\nAt least four occurrences well north of the breeding range in Alaska\r\nhave been recorded: St. George Island, fall of 1904; Cape Etolin,\r\nSeptember 14, 1927; Wainwright, a specimen in 1924; and Cape Halkett,\r\nin the fall of 1927.\r\n\r\nA specimen was collected on Okpatok Island in Hudson Strait in October\r\n1882, one was taken in Sandwich Bay in August 1908, and a specimen\r\nhas been reported from Cape Wolstenholme on the Ungava Peninsula. The\r\nspecies also has been recorded from Bermuda where at least one specimen\r\nwas collected in 1871.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--Arctic America: 6 records, June 3 to 16.\r\n  Florida: 18 records, March 25 to July 18; 9 records, April 16 to\r\n    May 18, indicating the height of the season.\r\n  Illinois: 22 records, April 30 to May 30; 11 records, May 13 to 21.\r\n  Michigan: 16 records, April 17 to June 24; 8 records, May 12 to 30.\r\n  New York: 15 records, May 13 to June 15; 8 records, May 25 to 29.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     COLAPTES AURATUS LUTEUS Bangs\r\n\r\n                           NORTHERN FLICKER\r\n\r\n                               PLATE 36\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nI can remember as clearly as if it were only yesterday my boyish,\r\nenthusiastic admiration for this beautiful bird, though it was between\r\n50 or 60 years ago that my father first showed me a freshly killed\r\nflicker. I was simply entranced with the softly blended browns, the\r\nred crescent on the head, the black crescent and bold spotting on the\r\nbreast, and, above all, with the golden glow in the wings and tail. Few\r\nbirds combine such charming colors and pleasing contrasts. I have never\r\nlost my admiration for it, and still consider it one of nature’s gems.\r\n\r\nIt, and its close relative, the red-shafted flicker, together are\r\nwidely distributed over nearly all the wooded regions of North America.\r\nConsequently it is widely known and over most of its range is a common\r\nand familiar species. Its prominence and popularity are attested by the\r\nlong list of vernacular names by which it is locally known. Franklin L.\r\nBurns (1900), in his monograph of the species, lists 123 such names;\r\nand later he adds nine more, bringing the list up to 132 names. These\r\nare far too many to be quoted here, and many of them are “very local or\r\nvery slight orthographical or cacographical variants.” I have always\r\nloved our local name “partridge woodpecker,” suggestive of my boyhood\r\ndays, when flickers, meadowlarks, and robins were considered legitimate\r\ngame. But now the name yellow-shafted flicker seems appropriate to\r\ndistinguish it, from the red-shafted flicker.\r\n\r\nThe haunts of the flicker are almost everywhere in open country or\r\nlightly wooded regions; it can hardly be called a forest-loving\r\nspecies, though I have often found it nesting in more or less extensive\r\ndeciduous woods; its favorite haunts during the summer seem to be in\r\nthe rural districts among the farms, orchards, and scattered woodlots;\r\nit seems to be at home, also, in villages and small towns, and even\r\nin some of the smaller cities, where spacious grounds and gardens\r\nprovide suitable surroundings. In fall and winter it is more apt to\r\nwander about in open woodlands, fields, and meadows or seek shelter in\r\nconiferous woods or swamps.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--Although many flickers remain all winter in the Northern\r\nStates, there is a decided spring migration of the great bulk of\r\nnorthern-bred birds that have wintered in the Southern States. These\r\nbirds gather in flocks during the late winter, and the northward\r\nmovement starts with the first mild weather, the migration being\r\nlargely performed during the night. Mr. Burns (1900) says that at\r\nBerwyn, Pa., the forerunners, consisting of solitary old males, appear\r\n“as early as Feb. 2 or as late as April 6, according to the promises of\r\nthe season, correlating in a measure with the date at which the first\r\nfrog is heard peeping. * * *\r\n\r\n“It becomes common soon after the hardy willow has unfolded its leaves,\r\nand about the time the fragrant spicewood blossoms, when the ants,\r\nspiders and beetles become active once more, and just in the height of\r\nthe arbutus season. The northward movement is far from being steady\r\nor regular, being largely governed by weather conditions; Mr. Burns\r\ncalculates from his mass of data that the average distance traveled\r\ndaily is about 12 miles, varying according to season and weather\r\nconditions from 7 to 48 miles per night. It is absolutely certain that\r\nit does not move steadily night after night, but only as the weather\r\npermits or necessitates and its physical condition allows.”\r\n\r\nFlickers often migrate in companies of considerable size, in\r\nloose, scattered flocks, noisy and active, flying from tree to\r\ntree and calling excitedly. Their arrival is announced by the loud\r\nchallenge-call, given from the top of some tall tree, _wicker_,\r\n_wicker_, _wicker_, or _wake-up_, _wake-up_, _wake-up_, as the male\r\nchallenges his rivals or invites his prospective mate to join him in\r\ncourtship. This, one of the most welcome sounds of early spring, is\r\nindeed a call to “wake up,” for all nature is awakening, buds are\r\nswelling on the trees, verdure is appearing in the woods and fields,\r\nthe early flowers are beginning to blossom, the hylas are peeping in\r\nthe warming pools, insects are becoming active, and the songs of the\r\nearly birds announce that spring is here. Another spring sound soon\r\nstrikes our ears, a loud, far-reaching, vibrant sound, the long, almost\r\ncontinuous roll of the flicker’s drumming, another challenge-call, a\r\npreliminary of the courtship performance; at frequent intervals, often\r\nrepeated over a long period in early morning, he beats his loud tattoo\r\non some hollow, resonant limb.\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--The courtship of the flicker is a lively and spectacular\r\nperformance, noisy, full of action, and often ludicrous, as three or\r\nmore birds of both sexes indulge in their comical dancing, nodding,\r\nbowing, and swaying motions, or chase each other around the trunk or\r\nthrough the branches of a tree. From the time of Audubon to the present\r\nday, many observers have noted and described the curious antics of this\r\nstar performer. But I prefer to quote first from some extensive notes\r\nrecently contributed by Francis H. Allen, as follows: “The courtship\r\nof the flicker is an elaborate and somewhat puzzling performance.\r\nTwo birds face each other on the branch of a tree or cling side by\r\nside, though at a little distance apart, on the trunk, and spread\r\ntheir tails and jerk their heads about in a sort of weaving motion,\r\nfrequently uttering a note that is peculiar to this performance, a\r\n_wick-up_ or _week-up_. The head motion is a series of backward jerks\r\nwith the bill pointing up at an angle of perhaps 60° and the head at\r\nthe same time swinging from side to side. Sometimes a short, low _wuck_\r\nis uttered from time to time during the performance. These bouts occur\r\nnot only between male and female, but frequently between two males or\r\ntwo females.\r\n\r\n“In April 1934, for more than a week I saw a trio of flickers about\r\nmy house. Invariably the two females went through courtship antics\r\ntogether, while the male fed on the ground nearby, apparently\r\ncompletely indifferent to them. One of the females was much more active\r\nthan the other, which usually kept a stiff pose with head drawn in,\r\nonly occasionally responding with feeble head-waggings. At no time did\r\nthe active female use any other display than the head-wagging, and\r\nthere was never any suggestion of combat or intimidation.\r\n\r\n“A year later, 1935, the flickers near my house behaved differently.\r\nIn the afternoon of April 24, the two males were singing loudly and\r\nfrequently in the woods, about an eighth of a mile away and at some\r\ndistance apart. By singing I mean, of course, the prolonged laughing\r\ncall of _wick-wick-wick_, etc. Presently they stopped singing, and one\r\nflew toward the other, stopping about halfway. Very soon the other\r\njoined him, and a long period of posturing and _wick-up_-ing ensued.\r\nBoth birds had the black mustaches of the male. The posturing was\r\nthe regular ‘weaving’ of the head and the fanning of the tail. The\r\nnotes, after the first at least, were much subdued in tone. There were\r\nfrequent intervals of quiet. The birds kept close together most of\r\nthe time, often with heads only two or three inches apart, or perhaps\r\nless. They flitted about frequently, sometimes clinging to the trunk\r\nof an oak, sometimes perched on a horizontal branch, and once or\r\ntwice they alighted on the stems of underbrush. After a long period\r\nof posturing, they met in a momentary tilt, and presently there was\r\nanother clash after more posturing, then a third clash, and after that\r\nthey separated. The same bird was the aggressor in at least two of\r\nthe clashes. As often in such encounters, the attacked bird stood his\r\nground and the attacker veered off. It was very mild warfare, if it was\r\nreally serious at all.\r\n\r\n“Two days after the bout of the two males, I saw two females engaged in\r\nthe dance in one of our pear trees. It lasted only a few minutes, and I\r\nheard no notes. Not long after the dance of the two females a prolonged\r\n‘sexual flight’ took place. It lasted five or ten minutes, as nearly as\r\nI could tell, with a few short intervals of resting. I could at no time\r\ndetermine the sexes of the two birds thus engaged, but occasionally a\r\nsnatch of faint song was heard (_wick-wick-wick_), and I assume that\r\nthey were male and female. They flew rather slowly and kept only a\r\nfew feet apart. It was evident that the spacing was intentional and\r\nthat the pursuer made no attempt to catch up with the other. The flight\r\ncovered a territory of several acres. It was a graceful and interesting\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n“I supposed at the time that this sexual flight indicated that the\r\naffair was completed, but later that afternoon I several times saw a\r\nmale and two females together, the females posturing and _wick-up_-ing,\r\nthe male motionless. The females showed no enmity toward each other and\r\ndid not face each other, as the males of two days before did. They kept\r\nrather farther apart. At one time a second male appeared and stayed\r\nabout for a time, but he disappeared, apparently without becoming a\r\nserious factor in the situation.\r\n\r\n“Three days later a pair of flickers, male and female, were feeding\r\npeacefully together on the lawn in the morning and in the afternoon,\r\nand I judged that the marital arrangements of at least two of my\r\nflickers had been completed.”\r\n\r\nMore active courtship on the part of a female flicker is thus described\r\nin some notes from Lewis O. Shelley: “On April 24, coincident with\r\na male flicker’s message from the elm stub, a female and a second\r\nmale appeared. All three were later in the cherry tree by our garden,\r\nperched on branches some three feet apart. The female took the\r\ninitiative in the following activities and, perched crosswise of the\r\nbranch, often bobbed and ducked up and down, then crosswise of the\r\nbranch jerked to left, right, left, right, head cocked erect and with\r\ntail fully spread. At times the males, less actively, did likewise, but\r\nfor the most part perched noncommittally, silent and still, giving but\r\nfew calls. At one time, after the female had displayed intermittently\r\nseveral times, and when the males had been still for some five minutes,\r\nshe sidled up to the nearest male and again displayed with much\r\nwing-fluttering and tail-spreading and sidewise twitchings; then the\r\nsame to the other male who flew when her actions of bobbing and bowing\r\nface to face commenced. Not to be outdone, or so affronted, she flew\r\nafter him, then the second male followed.”\r\n\r\nC. W. Leister (1919) noticed an aerial courtship evolution of the\r\nflicker, of which he says: “When first noticed, he was about fifty\r\nfeet from the ground and ascending in peculiar, bumpy, and jerky\r\nspirals. This was maintained until a height of about 350-400 feet was\r\nreached, when, after a short pause, a reverse of practically the same\r\nperformance was gone through. The Flicker (_Colaptes auratus luteus_),\r\nfor as such he was identified by this time, then alighted in a cherry\r\ntree, just above a female that we had previously failed to notice, and\r\ncompleted the performance by going through his more familiar courting\r\nantics.”\r\n\r\nA recrudescence of the amatory instinct is sometimes seen in fall. On\r\nSeptember 22, 1933, a clear, warm morning, a pair of flickers, male and\r\nfemale, were watched for some time as they performed their courtship\r\ndance on the top of one of my chimneys, where there might have been\r\nsome warmth remaining from a fire that had since died out. They danced\r\naround on all four sides of the chimney, always facing each other, both\r\nof them bowing and swaying the head and neck, or whole body, from side\r\nto side, with the neck extended and the bill pointing almost straight\r\nupward. Sometimes they stopped for a few seconds, holding the upright\r\nposture, or one performed while the other posed. There was no wing or\r\ntail display that I could see. Lewis O. Shelley tells me that he has\r\nseen flickers in courtship display while the young were just leaving\r\nthe nest.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Soon after mating is accomplished the choice for a nesting\r\nsite is made, and often the selection is made during courtship,\r\nespecially if a nesting cavity of the previous year is to be used.\r\nProbably the female usually makes the final decision, though there is\r\nsome evidence to indicate that in many cases the male selects the site\r\nand persuades his mate to accept it.\r\n\r\nMiss Althea R. Sherman (1910) made some very thorough studies of the\r\nnesting habits of the northern flicker at National, Iowa, in some boxes\r\nso arranged on her barn that she could observe the home life of the\r\nbirds at close range. The male and the female had been occupying two\r\ndifferent boxes as roosting places, and the eggs were laid in the box\r\noccupied by the male, from which it became evident “that the male bird\r\nchose the nesting place, and persuaded his mate to lay her eggs there,\r\neven when she was inclined to nest elsewhere, and when she had a box\r\nquite as good as his.”\r\n\r\nOften the male “stakes out his claim,” so to speak, in the vicinity of\r\nan old nest, where, during the courtship period, he utters his loud\r\nmating call for several days, or even weeks, before the female answers\r\nthe invitation. Then, after mating is accomplished, his chosen mate may\r\nor may not accept his choice of a nesting site. The desirability of the\r\nnesting site may in such cases influence the female’s choice of a mate,\r\nfor she is as much interested in having a comfortable and safe home as\r\nin choosing a handsome husband.\r\n\r\nHaving chosen the site, the pair set about repairing the old cavity or\r\nexcavating a new one, at which both birds work diligently for anywhere\r\nfrom a week to three weeks, depending on the conditions they find.\r\nMr. Shelley tells me that, in his experience with several nests, the\r\nnesting cavity is completed from a week to a fortnight before the eggs\r\nare laid. The chips are usually, but not always, carried away to some\r\ndistance from the nest tree, but often chips are merely scattered about\r\nthe base of the tree. William Brewster (1936) gives the following\r\naccount of rather peculiar behavior of a flicker while excavating its\r\nnest:\r\n\r\n     Found a Flicker at work excavating a hole in an apple-tree\r\n     in Bensen’s orchard. I was passing the tree within six feet\r\n     when I heard a low tapping, accompanied by a continuous\r\n     muffled whining sound. Turning, I at once saw the bird’s\r\n     tail projecting from the hole, which was not over five\r\n     feet above the ground. For a minute or more the pecking\r\n     and whining continued uninterruptedly, the tail wriggling\r\n     violently the while. Evidently the bird had carried in the\r\n     hole to just that point where she had less room to work\r\n     than she had had before or would have afterwards. In other\r\n     words, she had just about reached the point where the\r\n     entrance hole must begin to be expanded into a chamber and\r\n     to turn downward. It seemed to me that the whining sound\r\n     expressed rage or impatience. Perhaps it was the Flicker’s\r\n     form of swearing!\r\n\r\nThe northern flicker seems to show no very decided preference for any\r\none species of tree in its choice of a nesting site, though I believe\r\nit does prefer a dead tree, or a dead stub on a living tree, or a tree\r\nthat has a soft or partially decayed heart. It has always seemed to\r\nme that in New England we find more nests in large apple trees in old\r\norchards than elsewhere, the nest being excavated in the main trunk, or\r\nlarge upright branch, at no great height from the ground. Such trees\r\nmay have a hard outer shell, but the interior is often more or less\r\nsoft. Old orchards are becoming scarce in my vicinity, which forces the\r\nflickers to look elsewhere. Next in importance here as a common nesting\r\nsite is the trunk or stub of a dead white pine tree. Mr. Burns (1900)\r\nmentions one dead pine “perforated with 25 or 30 holes, most of which\r\nwere in use at one time or another.” He lists, as favorite trees in the\r\nMiddle and Eastern States, “apple, sycamore, oak, butternut, cherry,\r\nelm, chestnut, maple, poplar, beech, ash, pine, hickory, etc.” In\r\nPennsylvania, he says that J. Warren Jacobs has “found the sycamore to\r\nbe the favorite, with the apple and maple second, the beech and locust\r\nthird, oak and cherry fourth, and all other varieties fifth.”\r\n\r\nMr. Burns continues: “From Ohio westward the apple orchard is a\r\nfavorite with the poplar, willow, maple, oak, elm, walnut, cottonwood,\r\netc., more or less resorted to, according to availability. It very\r\nseldom nests in a living coniferous tree, though it has been known to\r\nnest in a living red cedar and in dead hemlocks and spruces.”\r\n\r\nTelegraph, telephone, and other tall poles, as well as fenceposts,\r\nare favorite nesting sites in the prairie regions and other parts of\r\nthe West, where trees are scarce. Frank L. Farley writes to me that\r\nin the timbered country of northern Alberta, “where there are many\r\nsuitable nesting trees and stubs, the telephone and telegraph poles are\r\nfrequently used for nesting. These poles are usually cedar and it is\r\nassumed that the birds prefer these for nesting, because of the ease\r\nwith which they can excavate.”\r\n\r\nFlickers quite often nest in boxes erected for that purpose and in\r\nbuildings, much to the annoyance of the owners. I have frequently\r\nseen nests in icehouses; these have double walls, the intervening\r\nspace being filled with sawdust; the birds drill through the outer\r\nwalls and make their nests in the sawdust. The cornices and walls\r\nof many buildings on the farms, as well as the towers of churches\r\nand schoolhouses, are perforated, and the eggs laid on the beams or\r\nboarding within. Mr. Burns (1900) records the following interesting\r\ncase:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Burke H. Sinclair found a nest containing eggs in the\r\n     garret of the town high school. The birds obtained entrance\r\n     to this large three-story brick building by means of a\r\n     displaced brick. As in all infloored lofts it consists of\r\n     nothing but the parallel rafters, with attached lath and\r\n     plaster, which forms the ceiling of the room below. This\r\n     frail floor is about ten inches below the entrance hole,\r\n     and the nest was situated about one foot from and directly\r\n     in front of the entrance. The place had evidently been\r\n     used for several years, there being at least a peck of\r\n     wood chippings, some fresh, but a large quantity old and\r\n     discolored with age. The nest was placed between two of the\r\n     parallel rafters and composed of these chippings, being\r\n     about six inches thick by eighteen inches in diameter. This\r\n     material had been all cut from the rafters on the floor and\r\n     the roof overhead.\r\n\r\nA number of other unusual nesting sites have been recorded. F. A. E.\r\nStarr tells me of a nest that “was in an old stump two feet high; the\r\nsix eggs were on a bed of rotten wood at ground level.” Dr. Jonathan\r\nDwight, Jr. (1893), reports a nest that he found on Prince Edward\r\nIsland; the “nest with fully fledged young was examined in the top of\r\na hollow fence post. No excavation had been made by the bird, and the\r\nyoung were entirely exposed to the weather.” Flickers occasionally nest\r\nin natural cavities in trees, where no excavation is needed beyond\r\nenlarging the opening, if necessary, or cleaning out the interior.\r\nNed Hollister (1918) reports that a pair of flickers and a pair of\r\nhouse wrens nested in holes in an old stump in a lion’s cage in the\r\nNational Zoological Park in Washington. Mr. Burns (1900) writes: “It\r\nhas been found breeding far out on the prairie in an old wagon hub,\r\nsurrounded by weeds; also in barrels, and one instance of an excavation\r\nof the regulation size in a hay stack is on record; another nested in\r\na crevice of an unused chimney for several years; and stranger yet it\r\nhas been found more than once occupying Kingfisher’s and enlarged Bank\r\nSwallow’s burrows.”\r\n\r\nThe haystack nest is reported by Major Bendire (1895), on the authority\r\nof William A. Bryant, of New Sharon, Iowa, as follows:\r\n\r\n     On a small hill, a quarter of a mile distant from my home,\r\n     stood a haystack which had been placed there two years\r\n     previously. The owner, during the winter of 1889-’90,\r\n     had cut the stack through the middle and hauled away\r\n     one portion, leaving the other standing with the end\r\n     smoothly trimmed. The following spring I noticed a pair\r\n     of yellow-shafted flickers about the stack showing signs\r\n     of wanting to make it a fixed habitation. One morning\r\n     a few days later I was amused at the efforts of one of\r\n     the pair. It was clinging to the perpendicular end of\r\n     the stack and throwing out chipped hay at a rate to defy\r\n     competition. This work continued for nearly a week, and\r\n     in that time the pair had excavated a cavity 20 inches in\r\n     depth. The entrance was located 8½ feet above ground, and\r\n     was 2½ inches in diameter and dug back into the stack for 6\r\n     inches, where it turned sharply downward and was slightly\r\n     enlarged at the bottom. On May 28 I took a handsome set\r\n     of seven eggs from the nest, the eggs lying on a bed of\r\n     chipped hay. The birds lingered about the stack and by June\r\n     14 had deposited another set of eggs. * * * I never could\r\n     quite understand the philosophy of their peculiar choice of\r\n     this site, as woodland is abundant here. A well-timbered\r\n     creek bottom was less than half a mile distant, while large\r\n     orchards and groves surround the place on every hand.\r\n\r\nKumlien and Hollister (1903) and J. A. Farley (1901) record instances\r\nof flickers nesting on hay; in each case the birds bored a hole through\r\nthe walls of a barn and laid their eggs in a hollow in a pile of hay\r\nnear the entrance hole. William Brewster (1909) published an account\r\nof a flicker’s nest on the open ground, found by some ladies on Cape\r\nCod and seen by him. Beside a sandy road, “fully a quarter of a mile\r\nfrom the nearest house and bordered on both sides by dense woods of\r\npitch pines, the ladies found five eggs of the Flicker lying together\r\nin a hollow in the ground within a few feet of the deeply rutted wagon\r\ntrack.” The nest “was a circular, saucer-shaped depression, measuring\r\n21¼ inches across the top, by 3 inches in depth. Dry yellowish sand\r\nmixed with fine gravel and wholly free from vegetation of any kind,\r\nliving or dead, formed its bottom and the gently sloping sides, as well\r\nas the surface of the level ground about it for two or three yards in\r\nevery direction, but a little further back there were weeds and grasses\r\ngrowing sparingly, in slightly richer soil.” Photographs of two nests\r\nsimilarly located may be seen in Bird-Lore, volume 18, page 399, and\r\nvolume 36, page 105.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns’s data show that the height of the nest from the ground\r\nvaries in middle and eastern States from 2 to 60 feet, and in central\r\nwestern States from ground level to 90 feet. His accumulated data\r\non the measurements of nesting cavities show that the depth of the\r\nexcavation is “greatest in New York and New England (10 to 36 inches),\r\nIllinois (14 to 24 inches), Pennsylvania (10 to 18 inches), and\r\nMinnesota (9 to 18 inches).” Probably the depth of the cavity depends\r\non the quality of the wood and the age of the nest; when an old cavity\r\nis used, it is usually deepened somewhat. Dr. H. C. Oberholser (1896)\r\ngives the measurements of four Ohio nests; the total depth varied from\r\n7 to 18 inches; the diameter of the entrance varied from 2.00 by 2.00\r\nto 4.00 by 4.00 and averaged 2.94 by 2.72 inches. Mr. Burns (1900)\r\nsays the diameter of the cavity near the bottom varies from 4.50 to\r\n10.00, and averages 7.67 inches. No nesting material is taken in from\r\noutside, but enough fine chips are left in the bottom of the hole\r\nto make a soft bed, in which the eggs are partially buried. Carl W.\r\nBuchheister tells me that he once found a nest “the bottom of which\r\nwas 6 inches below the ground level and 12 inches below the opening, a\r\nround hole which was 6 inches above the ground. There was but one egg.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The flicker is notorious as a prolific egg layer, but under\r\nordinary circumstances, when not disturbed, the average set consists of\r\nsix to eight eggs. Incubated sets of as few as three or four have been\r\nfound, sets of nine and ten are not very rare, and as many as 17 have\r\nbeen found in a nest at one time; the large numbers may be products of\r\ntwo females. Mr. Burns (1900) records the contents of 169 sets of the\r\nnorthern flicker as 11 sets of four, 16 sets of five, 35 sets of six,\r\n34 sets of seven, 38 sets of eight, 17 sets of nine, 13 sets of ten, 3\r\nsets of twelve, and one each of thirteen and fourteen. Major Bendire\r\n(1895) states that Steward Ogilby, of Staten Island, N. Y., reports\r\n“finding a brood of not less than nineteen young Flickers in one nest,\r\nall alive and apparently in good condition.”\r\n\r\nIf robbed of its eggs, the flicker will continue to lay new sets for a\r\nlong time. Dr. Barton W. Evermann (1889) “obtained thirty-seven eggs\r\nin forty-nine days from a ‘yellowhammer’ which had its nest near my\r\nhouse. The eggs were in seven sets, five, five, five, six, seven, four,\r\nand five eggs respectively.” J. Parker Norris (1888) took five sets of\r\nsix eggs each from a nest in Pennsylvania between May 16 and June 18.\r\nSeveral other similar cases of persistent laying have been reported,\r\nall of which indicate that an egg is laid each day and that the birds\r\nbegin at once to replace the lost set. Mr. Burns (1900) lists a number\r\nof such cases, where no nest egg was left to induce the bird to keep\r\non laying; the largest number reported was 48 eggs in 65 days. My\r\nneighbor, Charles L. Phillips, tried the experiment of taking one egg\r\neach day, leaving one as a nest egg; he holds the extraordinary record\r\nof having taken 71 eggs from one nest in 73 days; the poor bird rested\r\nonly two days in the long strain of over two months.\r\n\r\nEggs of the flicker have sometimes been found in the nests of other\r\nbirds. In an old orchard, not far from my home, I once found a\r\nflicker’s egg in a bluebird’s nest, with five eggs of the latter; and\r\nin another cavity in the same tree was a tree swallow’s nest containing\r\nfive eggs of the swallow and an egg of the flicker. As this was in a\r\nremote locality, it is hardly likely that the eggs were placed there\r\nartificially, and the chances are that the flicker’s nest had been\r\ndestroyed and she was forced to lay in the nearest available cavity.\r\nMr. Burns (1900) says: “A similar instance is recorded by E. G. Elliot,\r\nBradford, Mass., May 16th, ’84, of a set of five eggs of bluebird\r\nand one of flicker, nest of grass and feathers. Records of European\r\nhouse sparrow and red-headed woodpecker eggs in freshly excavated\r\nquarters with one or more eggs of the Flicker are not uncommon, and\r\nupon investigation the latter proved to be the aggrieved party in every\r\ninstance.” He also tells of a flicker that laid an egg in a mourning\r\ndove’s nest.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the flicker are pure lustrous white, with a brilliant\r\ngloss; the shell is translucent, and, when fresh, the yolk shows\r\nthrough it, suffusing the egg with a delicate pinkish glow, which is\r\nvery beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe shape is quite variable, but the majority are ovate; some are\r\nshort-ovate or elliptical-ovate, some nearly oval, and some rarely\r\nsomewhat pointed. The measurements of 57 eggs average 26.85 by 20.58\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =30.48= by\r\n22.86, 28.19 by =24.38=, =24.45= by 21.34, and 27.68 by =19.05=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--The period of incubation of the flicker has been said to\r\nbe from 14 to 16 days. Miss Sherman’s (1910) careful observations on\r\nmarked eggs, laid on known dates, indicate a shorter period. From\r\nsome former nests she had learned “that sometimes the eggs hatched\r\nin nine days, but more frequently in ten days after the laying of\r\nthe last egg.” In these cases, incubation may have begun before the\r\nset was complete, or the eggs may have received some heat from the\r\nbody of the male, for she said that, in at least one case, “while the\r\neggs were being laid, and before incubation began the male roosted in\r\nthe box with the eggs.” According to a later observation, “the exact\r\ntime for incubation had been twelve days, three hours and fifty-two\r\nminutes. The seventh egg hatched four hours later making its period of\r\nincubation eleven days and eight hours nearly.” After another similar\r\nexperience with the hatching of nine marked eggs, which extended over a\r\nperiod from 5:40 a. m. one day until 10:48 a. m. the next day, she says:\r\n“Roughly speaking, then, the time that our Flickers take for incubation\r\nis from eleven to twelve days.”\r\n\r\nHer observations showed that the duties of incubation are shared by\r\nboth sexes, that the male usually incubates during the night, but “by\r\nday the duties of incubation seem to be shared about equally between\r\nthe two birds, who are close sitters, the eggs seldom being found\r\nalone. Of the length of the sittings no adequate record has been kept,\r\nbut those lasting from one hour and a half to two hours have been\r\nnoted.”\r\n\r\nMiss Sherman (1910) noted that “the usual time for depositing the eggs\r\nin the nest appears to be the hour between five and six o’clock in the\r\nmorning,” though in one case an egg was laid between 11 a. m. and\r\n4 p. m.\r\n\r\nSome of her observations on the young follow:\r\n\r\n     Until the young are about eleven days old, they lie in a\r\n     circle in the nest, their long necks stretched over each\r\n     other, then for nearly a week they press against the side\r\n     of the nest. At seventeen or eighteen days of age, their\r\n     claws having acquired a needlelike sharpness, they begin\r\n     to cling to the wall of the nest, and when three weeks old\r\n     they are able to climb to the hole and be fed while the\r\n     parent hangs outside.\r\n\r\n     Although the eyes of the nestlings are not open until\r\n     they are ten days old yet these organs are by no means\r\n     dormant. An easy proof of this is made by placing the hand\r\n     noiselessly over the entrance hole when they are no more\r\n     than three or four days old, and are lying apparently\r\n     asleep; up comes every head and they beg for food, getting\r\n     none they soon sleep, when the experiment may be repeated,\r\n     gaining from the young the same response that is given when\r\n     a parent darkens the hole.\r\n\r\n     That cry of the young which is so often described as a\r\n     hissing sound, begins very soon after they are hatched.\r\n     At first exceedingly faint it soon grows stronger, and is\r\n     uttered day and night for two weeks. A parent upon taking\r\n     its place to brood these wailing nestlings begins to croon\r\n     a lullaby and continues this musical murmur until it falls\r\n     asleep, which is often quite soon. It has no effect in\r\n     lessening the noise of the youngsters, yet the parent\r\n     faithfully renders its cradle song until the young cease\r\n     to make this noise which is about the time they begin to\r\n     show fear. Of other cries that they make, there is the\r\n     chuckling noise uttered when the little one is in the act\r\n     of seizing the food-bearing bill, and there is a cry that\r\n     sounds like a whine. Still another one is a note of alarm\r\n     given when the young are disturbed by some such thing as\r\n     the opening of the trap door. This uttered in unison has a\r\n     very theatrical effect strongly suggesting the chorus of\r\n     the stage. After they have commenced to move about freely\r\n     in the nest they make much of the time a pleasant sound\r\n     like a chatter or quack, as if talking to each other. And\r\n     lastly comes the grown-up Flicker “pe-ap”, which they begin\r\n     to call as soon as they climb to the hole. * * *\r\n\r\n     Some broods are much more quarrelsome than others. Their\r\n     battle ground is in the vicinity of the hole. The one in\r\n     possession of the hole maintains his supremacy there by\r\n     occasional withdrawals of his head from the hole in order\r\n     to deliver vigorous blows on the heads of all within his\r\n     reach. This is the case with the stronger ones, the weaker\r\n     ones frequently are driven from the vantage place. When\r\n     the hole is large enough for two to thrust out their heads\r\n     together, they draw within after the serving of a meal and\r\n     fight furiously, while a waiting third may slip up and gain\r\n     the coveted hole. But all their fighting days seem to be\r\n     confined to a few in the fourth week of their lives.\r\n\r\n     * * * In very early life a meal is served to baby Flicker\r\n     with many insertions of the parent’s bill, as many as\r\n     thirty-four have been counted, but from eight to twenty are\r\n     the ordinary number, decreasing to three or four before the\r\n     young leave the nest. A record made during a continuous\r\n     watch of six hours and thirty-two minutes shows that each\r\n     parent fed five times; that the father delivered his supply\r\n     with eighty-two insertions of the bill, while the mother\r\n     used but forty-one. Probably the father brought more food\r\n     since on every count he proved himself the more devoted\r\n     parent. In grasping the bill the point of the youngster’s\r\n     bill is at right angles with that of the parent’s, thus\r\n     the opening between the food-bearing mandibles is covered\r\n     after the young have attained a few days of age, and\r\n     any over-dropping of food is prevented. This accident\r\n     frequently happens in the early days of the nest, then the\r\n     mussed up ants that fall are carefully picked up by the\r\n     frugal parent when the feeding is over. * * *\r\n\r\n     Experiments show that to a nestling weighing 743 grains was\r\n     given a breakfast that weighed 76 grains, to one weighing\r\n     1,430 grains a dinner of 118 grains, and to another that\r\n     tipped the scales at 1,530 grains a supper of 103 grains.\r\n     Probably the weight of the average load is not far from one\r\n     hundred grains. * * *\r\n\r\n     When the young were eighteen days old during a watch of\r\n     four and one-half hours twenty-five meals were given to\r\n     five nestlings that wore distinguished marks. Three of\r\n     these are positively known to have received five meals\r\n     apiece, and two received four apiece. * * * At this age the\r\n     young Flickers every hour partake of food to the amount of\r\n     one-sixteenth of their own weight, or in one day consume\r\n     their full weight of food.\r\n\r\nShe says that flickers are very solicitous to keep a clean nest; for\r\nthe first nine or ten days the parents eat the excrements, but after\r\nthat the dejecta are carried out in the tough white sacks in which they\r\nare enclosed. If no sacks of excrement are found in the nest after\r\nfeeding, the parent solicits them; “this is done by biting the heel\r\njoints sometimes, but more often the fleshy protuberance that bears\r\nthat budding promise of the tail.”\r\n\r\nShe says that the male “staid with the young every night until they\r\nwere three weeks old, brooding all of them until nearly two weeks of\r\nage, when they began pressing their breasts against the side of the\r\nnest, and he could cover the tails of two or three only, after which\r\nfor two or three nights he sat upon the bottom of the nest apart from\r\nthe young; then for four nights he hung upon the wall of the nest near\r\nthe hole; thereafter he staid with them no more.”\r\n\r\nHer records show that the young remained in the nest nearly or quite\r\nfour weeks, or from 25 to 28 days. During the last three or four days\r\nnearly all of them lost weight; this may have been due to the period\r\nof the heaviest feather growth, or because the parents may have let up\r\non the feeding to induce the young to leave the nest. Miss Sherman’s\r\nstatements, as to the period of incubation and the length of time that\r\nthe young remain in the nest, are quite at variance with statements\r\nmade by others, but her observations were so carefully and thoroughly\r\nmade under such favorable circumstances that they are more convincing\r\nthan less accurate observations of others.\r\n\r\nSome others have also described the method of feeding the young by\r\nregurgitation in a manner that differs from that observed by Miss\r\nSherman. Mr. Brewster (1936), for example, says:\r\n\r\n     Standing on the edge of the hole, the parent would select\r\n     one--usually the nearest, I thought--and bending down would\r\n     drive his bill to its base into the gaping mouth which\r\n     instantly closed tightly around it, when the head and bill\r\n     of the parent was worked up and down with great rapidity\r\n     for from one to one and one-half seconds (timed with a\r\n     stop watch), the young meanwhile holding on desperately\r\n     and apparently never once losing its grasp, although its\r\n     poor little head was jerked up and down violently. The\r\n     first, or entering downward thrust of the parent’s bill\r\n     looked like a vicious stab, the bird apparently striking\r\n     with all its force and as if with the design of piercing\r\n     his offspring to the vitals. The subsequent up and down\r\n     motion was invariably rapid and regular and resembled the\r\n     bill movement of a woodpecker while “drumming.” It also\r\n     suggested the stroke of a piston.\r\n\r\nIn this case the top of the stump had been broken off, leaving the\r\nnest open and exposed, so that every motion could be clearly seen from\r\na distance of not over 15 feet. After the young had left the nest, he\r\ndiscovered that “the nest was left in a terribly foul state, the bottom\r\nbeing a disgusting mass of muddy excrement alive with wriggling worms.\r\n* * * These young, however, managed to keep very clean and all, so far\r\nas I could discover, were perfectly free from vermin.” Apparently the\r\nold birds find it difficult to clean the nest after the young reach a\r\ncertain size.\r\n\r\nW. I. Lyon (1922) tells an interesting story of a screech owl that\r\nadopted and brooded a family of young flickers, after its own nest in\r\nthe same tree had been broken up twice; the owl even brought in part of\r\na small bird, perhaps intending to feed it to the young flickers, which\r\nwere all the time being fed by their parents and were successfully\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--Miss Sherman (1910) gives a very good description of the\r\nnaked and blind nestling, as follows: “The pellucid color of the newly\r\nhatched Flicker resembles that of freshly sun-burned human skin, but\r\nso translucent is the nestling’s skin that immediately after a feeding\r\none can see the line of ants that stretches down the bird’s throat and\r\nremains in view two or three minutes before passing onward. This may be\r\nwitnessed for several days while the skin assumes a coarser red, until\r\nit begins to thicken and become a bluish hue, before the appearance of\r\nthe pin-feathers. These may be detected under the skin on the fifth day\r\nat the same time that bristle-like projections about one-sixteenth of\r\nan inch long announce the coming of the rectrices and remiges.”\r\n\r\nMr. Burns (1900) says: “It is not known when the white membranous\r\nprocess which extends from either side of the base of the lower\r\nmandible disappears, but it probably goes at a very early age. This\r\nformation is apparently peculiar to all young woodpeckers, as suggested\r\nby Frank A. Bates, in the _Ornithologist and Oologist_, Vol. XVI, p.\r\n35, but its use is unknown.” A photograph, published by E. H. Forbush\r\n(1927), shows that this does not wholly disappear until the young\r\nbird is nearly fledged; its function is probably to help guide the\r\nregurgitated food from the mouth of the adult into the throat of the\r\nyoung bird during the feeding method noted by Miss Sherman (1910).\r\n\r\nThe young flicker is fully fledged in its juvenal plumage when it\r\nleaves the nest; and, contrary to the rule among birds, this plumage\r\nmore nearly resembles the plumage of the adult male than that of the\r\nold female, as the young of both sexes have the black malar patches.\r\nThe black bands on the upper parts are much broader, the vinaceous\r\nportions of the head and neck are more tinged with gray, the malar\r\npatches are duller black, and the lower parts are paler with duller and\r\nlarger black spots than in the adult. The crown is usually more or less\r\nsuffused with dull red, especially in young males, and sometimes the\r\nred nuchal crescent is somewhat wider or more extensive; the crescent\r\non the breast is usually smaller; the yellow on the under sides of\r\nthe wings and tail is duller and more greenish; the black tips in the\r\ntail are duller and not so sharply defined against the yellow; and the\r\nupper tail coverts are black with white spots, instead of being white\r\nand boldly barred with black, as in the adult. The plumage is soft and\r\nloose in texture and the bill is small and weak.\r\n\r\nThis plumage is worn but a short time, as a complete molt begins in\r\nJuly and is usually finished in September or October, producing a\r\nfirst winter plumage that is practically adult. Adults have a complete\r\npostnuptial molt at about the same time of year. A detailed account\r\nof the progress of the molt of young birds is given by William Palmer\r\n(1901) and one of the adults by Burns (1900); both accounts are too\r\nlong to be quoted here. Fall adults in fresh plumage are very handsome\r\nbirds, more deeply and richly colored than spring birds; the upper\r\nparts are deeper brown and the lower parts are suffused with yellowish\r\nbuff; wear and fading produce a more contrasted plumage in the spring\r\nin which the dark markings are less obscured and the soft suffusion has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe interesting and extensive hybridizing with the red-shafted flicker\r\nwill be discussed under the latter species.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The flicker is more terrestrial in its feeding habits than\r\nany of our other woodpeckers. It is a common sight to see one of them\r\nhopping about on a lawn, or in an open place in the woods and fields,\r\nprobing in the ground for ants or picking up ground insects or fallen\r\nberries. It is one of our most useful birds, worthy of the fullest\r\nprotection. Professor Beal (1911) has shown that 60.92 percent of its\r\nfood consists of animal matter and 39.08 percent of vegetable matter.\r\nAbout 75 percent of the animal food, or 45 percent of the entire food,\r\nconsists of ants. The flicker eats more ants than any other bird;\r\nants were found in 524 of the 684 stomachs examined, and 98 stomachs\r\ncontained no other food; one stomach contained over 5,000 ants, and\r\ntwo others held over 3,000 each. If it had no other beneficial habit,\r\nthe flicker would deserve protection for the good it does in keeping\r\nin check these injurious and annoying insects. Ants protect plant lice\r\nof various species, which may become very injurious to many kinds of\r\ncultivated plants, inflicting serious losses for the agricultural\r\ninterests; the plant lice, or aphids, secrete a sweet honey-dew juice,\r\nof which the ants are very fond; consequently these tiny insects are\r\nherded by the ants and milked like cows. The ants take good care of\r\ntheir honey-producing “cattle,” driving them away from ladybugs and\r\nother enemies, leading them to new pastures, if the old ones dry up,\r\nsheltering the aphid eggs in their nests, and carrying the young aphids\r\nout onto the plants to feed. Mr. Forbush (1927) also says: “Ants riddle\r\nposts set in the ground or any timber or lumber resting upon or in\r\ncontact with the ground. They destroy the sills of buildings set close\r\nto the ground and often ruin living trees, especially such as have a\r\nfew dead roots. They infest lawns and buildings, destroying grass on\r\nthe lawns and food in the house, and are difficult to eradicate. They\r\nsometimes eat alive the young of certain ground-nesting birds. They are\r\nvery prolific and require a severe check on their numbers. Otherwise\r\nthey would become unbearable pests.”\r\n\r\nThe flicker explores the ground, often scratching away leaves or\r\nrubbish, to locate the ant nests, digs into the nest with its long\r\nbill, and, as the ants come pouring out, it laps them up in quantities\r\nor inserts its long, sticky tongue deep down into the nest to get the\r\nyoung and eggs. Early in spring it digs into the large mounds of the\r\nmound-building ants, while the ants are less active, or tears open some\r\nrotten stump to uncover a nest. Only a few days ago, I dug into an old\r\napple-tree stump for some rotten wood to put on some of my wildflowers\r\nand uncovered a large nest of ants; within a very few minutes my pair\r\nof flickers were on the job cleaning up the ants and their pupae.\r\n\r\nOther insect food of the flicker includes a variety of beetles,\r\nwasps, grasshoppers, crickets, mole crickets, chinch bugs, wood lice,\r\ncaterpillars, grubs, and various flying insects, which it sometimes\r\ncatches on the wing, darting after them like a flycatcher (Burns, 1900).\r\n\r\nAccording to Beal (1911), 39.08 percent of its food is vegetable\r\nmatter. Most of this consists of wild fruits and berries, such\r\nas the berries of the dogwood (_Cornus_) and Virginia creeper,\r\nhackberries, blueberries, huckleberries, pokeberries, serviceberries\r\n(_Amelanchier_), elderberries, barberries, mulberries, blackberries,\r\nwild grapes, wild black cherries, choke cherries, cultivated cherries,\r\nand the berries of the black alder, sour gum, black gum, greenbrier\r\n(_Smilax_), spicebush (_Benzoin_), red cedar, hawthorn, mountain\r\nash, and woodbine. Harold H. Bailey (1913) says that while the fall\r\nmigration is at its height in Virginia, about October first, “they are\r\nparticularly fond of the blue berry of the black-gum tree, and after\r\nonce finding a tree with fruit, will continue to come to it until every\r\nberry is gone, even though continually shot at. I remember a case a few\r\nyears back, when a local gunner killed fifty-seven flickers from one\r\nblack-gum tree in one forenoon. After the gumberries are gone, they\r\ntake to the dogwood berry for their main article of food, a fine red\r\nberry and always plentiful in Tidewater.”\r\n\r\nThe flicker feeds freely on the seeds of the poison ivy and poison\r\nsumac and perhaps does some harm in distributing the seeds of these\r\nnoxious plants. Professor Beal (1895) also includes the seeds of\r\nother sumacs, clover, grasses, pigweed, mullein, ragweed, and other\r\nunidentified seeds, and the seeds of the magnolia and knotweed. Mr.\r\nBurns (1900) adds wild strawberries, dewberries, raspberries, and wild\r\nplums, also acorns, beechnuts, corn from shocks, and oats, wheat, and\r\nrye from stacks.\r\n\r\nThe birds that Miss Sherman (1910) watched in their nesting box\r\nate considerable sawdust. “That at one time the male ate three\r\ntablespoonfuls is deemed a modest estimate. An attempt to measure the\r\namount both ate by a fresh supply daily showed the consumption of three\r\nor more handfuls. The sawdust came from sugar maple, white and red oak\r\nwood.” She seemed to think that flickers have “little use for water,”\r\nhaving seen them drink only twice, during many hours of watching from\r\na blind, “all of which taken together would amount to weeks.” Owen\r\nDurfee speaks in his notes of having seen three flickers drinking, or\r\neating, snow on a cold day in winter; he saw one drop down onto a patch\r\nof snow on a stone wall and begin eating the snow. “His motions were\r\njust like a chicken drinking water--the partly closed bill was dipped\r\ninto the snow and then held up in the air and the mandibles worked as\r\nthough chewing or dissolving it, when another dip would be made. Soon\r\ntwo other flickers flew down in the same manner and secured some snow\r\nwater. On approaching, I found the footprints and several little round\r\nholes somewhat smaller than a pencil.”\r\n\r\nI have often seen them drinking water and so have other observers;\r\nperhaps they drink copiously but not often.\r\n\r\nFrancis H. Allen says in his notes: “I have seen one feeding in the\r\nmanner of a chickadee among the twigs of a tree, perching crosswise of\r\nthe twig and flitting about actively, gleaning some minute food. Mr.\r\nBrewster told me that he had seen a flicker feeding this way.”\r\n\r\nJoseph J. Hickey tells me that he has seen a flicker feeding after the\r\nmanner of an Arctic three-toed woodpecker, deliberately scaling off the\r\nbark in search for food; this bird had denuded about half the bark of a\r\nhemlock.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--In ordinary short flights, the flicker proclaims its\r\nrelationship to the other woodpeckers by its rhythmic bounding flight,\r\nthe wings beating more rapidly on the rises and much less so on the\r\ndips, which are usually followed by a short sail on motionless wings.\r\nMr. Burns (1900) noted that the dips occur about every 15 or 20 feet\r\nand that the bird drops about 3 feet on each dip. On more prolonged\r\nflights the flight is steadier, more direct, strong, and fairly swift.\r\nIt does not ordinarily fly at any great height, except when migrating.\r\nWhen alighting on a tree trunk, there is a graceful upward glide,\r\nthe trunk is grasped with the feet, and the tail is used as a prop in\r\ntrue woodpecker fashion; but the flicker is more apt to alight on a\r\nhorizontal branch than other woodpeckers, when there is less upward\r\nglide and an upright posture is assumed, as balance is acquired.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the flicker proceeds slowly by short hops, but sometimes\r\nit runs rapidly for a few steps and then stops; it seems content to\r\nconfine its foraging to a rather limited area and does not appear very\r\nactive.\r\n\r\nSpring drumming on a resonant limb, or inside a nesting cavity, is\r\nan essential part of the call to courtship or mating, and perhaps a\r\nsignal call for other purposes; but it is used at other times, perhaps\r\nfor sheer amusement. This habit sometimes becomes a nuisance, since\r\nthe bird has discovered that the tin roof of a house serves as the\r\nbest kind of a drum; here he comes morning after morning while we are\r\nenjoying our slumbers, from which we are rudely awakened at an unseemly\r\nhour. Mr. DuBois writes to me that, on an afternoon in June, “a flicker\r\nwas drumming on the lid of a large galvanized iron ash or garbage can\r\nat the corner of the back porch of a residence; he stood on the top of\r\nthe lid and, at intervals, after looking around, he beat an extremely\r\nrapid roll on this metallic drum; the effect was startling.”\r\n\r\nAs to the roosting habits of flickers, Miss Sherman (1910) writes:\r\n“Of all our birds the flickers are the earliest to retire at night,\r\nsometimes going to their lodgings an hour before sundown, the customary\r\ntime being about a half hour before sunset. Generally they go out soon\r\nafter sunrise, but on cool autumn mornings they have been known to\r\nlinger much longer. During a rainstorm in the middle of the day they\r\nhave been seen to seek their apartments, also in fine weather they have\r\nbeen found there enjoying the seclusion thus afforded.”\r\n\r\nFrank R. Smith, of Hyattsville, Md., sends me the following note, dated\r\nFebruary 28, 1936: “For some nights, a flicker has been roosting in the\r\nshell of a dead tree, from which one side has decayed away, leaving a\r\ntroughlike section of its trunk standing. He roosts about 12 feet from\r\nthe ground. This morning it was cloudy and he left the roosting place\r\nat 7:25, although official sunrise is at 6:37.” Mr. Shelley tells me\r\nthat he flushed a male from the nest tree, “where he clung each night\r\nabout 3 feet above the nest hole, with the female brooding the young\r\nwithin.” Flickers will roost in any open cavity in a tree, or even in a\r\npartially sheltered spot on the open trunk; they often drill holes in\r\nbarns or under the eaves of houses for winter roosts; a favorite winter\r\nroosting place is in the sawdust between the double walls of icehouses.\r\nSometimes they dig a hole into a vacant building and fail to find their\r\nway out; I once found one dead inside the garage at my summer cottage,\r\nwhich had been closed all winter. Mr. Forbush (1927) says that “during\r\none winter at Wareham one apparently slept on the wall of my summer\r\ncottage under the eaves, clinging to one of the ornamental battens in\r\nan upright position as it would cling to a tree trunk. This bird for\r\nsome unaccountable reason chose the north side of the cottage. He was\r\nthere night after night at dusk and also at daylight each morning.\r\nMr. K. F. Carr tells of a flicker that was accustomed to pass winter\r\nnights in a chimney of an unoccupied dwelling in a thickly settled\r\nneighborhood which undoubtedly was a more comfortable roosting place\r\nthan the north side of my cottage.”\r\n\r\nDr. Lynds Jones told Mr. Burns (1900) that “at Oberlin College a single\r\nbird roosted between the vertical water pipe and wall of Spear Library\r\nfor two successive winters, and another occupied the cupola of the\r\nTheological Seminary the succeeding winter.”\r\n\r\nFlickers are generally regarded as peaceful harmless birds, but the\r\nfollowing two quotations indicate that they are sometimes otherwise.\r\n\r\nO. P. Allert (1934) writes from Giard, Iowa: “On June 4, 1933, while in\r\nthe yard of my home, I was attracted by the cries of a pair of Robins\r\nand saw a female Flicker in the act of killing the two young that the\r\nRobins’ nest contained. One was killed in the nest, and the other\r\neither fell or was thrown to the ground, where the Flicker followed and\r\ndispatched it.”\r\n\r\nDr. Dayton Stoner (1932) writes: “While the flicker is not habitually\r\nbelligerent, it does on occasion show some aggressiveness. This most\r\nfrequently occurs during the breeding season. For example, on July\r\n11, 1929, in the Parker woods south of Lakeport, I came upon several\r\nflickers and two or three crows that were tormenting a red-shouldered\r\nhawk. The flickers were pecking excitedly on the limbs of the tree on\r\nwhich the hawk perched, and clamoring loudly at it. When the hawk flew\r\noff the flickers darted after it, pecking it unmercifully until it lit\r\nagain, when they were cautious about approaching close to the harassed\r\nhawk. This quarrel was continued for more than half an hour.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The flicker has an elaborate vocabulary; no other woodpecker,\r\nand few other birds, can produce a greater variety of loud striking\r\ncalls and soft conversational notes. A number of its many vernacular\r\nnames are based on a fancied resemblance to some one of its notes, and\r\nin most cases these names give a very fair idea of the note. A few of\r\nsuch names are “flicker,” “yucker,” “wacup,” “hit-tock,” “yarrup,”\r\n“clape,” and “piute”; and there are other modifications of these in\r\ndifferent combinations of letters.\r\n\r\nThe commonest and most characteristic note is the loud spring call, of\r\nwhich Eugene P. Bicknell (1885) says: “Its long rolling call may be\r\ntaken as especially representative of song, and is a characteristic\r\nsound of the empty woodland of early spring. It is usually given from\r\nsome high perch, and has a free, far-reaching quality, that gives it\r\nthe effect of a signal thrown out over the barren country, as if to\r\narouse sleeping nature. This call continues irregularly through the\r\nsummer, but then loses much of its prominence amid the multitude of\r\nbird voices. It is not infrequent in September, but later than the\r\nmiddle of October I have not heard it.”\r\n\r\nThis is a sharp, penetrating note, which can be heard at a long\r\ndistance; the syllables _wick, wick, wick, wick_, or _yuck, yuck,\r\nyuck, yuck_, are very rapidly uttered and repeated in long series.\r\nDr. Elon H. Eaton (1914) says that “it may be heard for more than\r\nhalf a mile and has been variously syllabized, usually written as\r\n‘_cuh-cuh-cuh-cuh_’,” which hardly represents my idea of the song.\r\n\r\nA softer note, heard during active courtship and display, sounds\r\nlike _wake-up, wake-up, wake-up_, or _yarrup, yarrup, yarrup_,\r\ngiven more deliberately in subdued tones and not so prolonged. This\r\nhas been referred to as the scythe-sharpening, or rollicking, song\r\nand has also been written as _yucker, yucker, yucker_, or _wicker,\r\nwicker, wicker_, or _hick-up, hick-up, hick-up_, or _flicker,\r\nflicker, flicker_. Mr. Bicknell (1885) has recorded these notes from\r\nApril 8 to September 5; there seems to be no seasonal regularity\r\nabout them, as they are probably affectionate notes of greeting.\r\nMr. Burns (1900) “heard an apparently rare variation, a metallic\r\n_Ka-wick-wick-wick-wick-wick-wick-wick-wick-wick-wick-ka_ by the male\r\nwhile close to the nest.”\r\n\r\nHe gives as conversational, or soliloquizing notes, “commonly a\r\nscanny, gurgling, almost involuntary _chur-r-r-r_ as danger seems\r\nto threaten it when on the wing, or when flushed from the ground or\r\njust before a-lighting, which may be interpreted as a note of warning\r\nor announcement of arrival according to the circumstances. I have\r\nheard a low guttural _who-del_ as it endeavored to balance itself on\r\na slender branch immediately after arrival.” A bird on a house roof,\r\nin December, “uttered an odd guttural call of _huck-a-woó-ah_ or\r\nagain only _woo woo_ evidently for his own edification.” Other soft\r\nconversational notes sound like _ouit-ouit_, or _puir-puir_, or a\r\ncooing _yu-cah-yu-cah_.\r\n\r\nDr. Eaton (1914) says: “When the flicker flies up from the ground\r\nand alights on a stub or fence post, he frequently bobs and bows to\r\nan imaginary audience and immediately thereafter jerks his head high\r\nupward giving voice to a sharp note like the syllable ‘clape.’” This is\r\na loud, explosive note and may indicate defiance or surprise.\r\n\r\nA common note, oftenest heard during summer and fall, is a plaintive\r\ncall suggesting one of the notes of the blue jay or the red-shouldered\r\nhawk. It is a loud and rather musical note, which has been variously\r\ninterpreted as _pee-ut_, _ye-a-up_, _pee-up_, _que-ah_, _kee-yer_,\r\netc., given singly or repeated two or three times, as a ringing call of\r\nconsiderable carrying power.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--While hopping about on the lawn, the flicker may be\r\nrecognized as a brown bird somewhat larger than a robin and with a\r\nrather long bill; if facing the observer, the black crescent on the\r\nspotted breast is rather conspicuous, but the red crescent on the\r\nnape does not show up much except at short range, nor does the black\r\nmalar patch of the male. The most conspicuous field mark is the white\r\nrump, which shows plainly as the bird rises from the ground and flies\r\naway; this probably serves as a direction mark, or a warning to the\r\ncompanions with which it is often associated. Then, of course, the\r\nflash of bright yellow in the wings and tail marks the bird in flight,\r\nchiefly when high in the air, but somewhat also in straightaway flight.\r\n\r\n_Enemies._--When I was a boy, 50 or 60 years ago, flickers,\r\nmeadowlarks, and robins were considered legitimate game, and they were\r\nvery good to eat. Bunches of these birds were often seen hanging in the\r\ngame dealers’ stalls. During our fall vacations on the coast, when the\r\nweather was unfavorable for coot shooting, my father and uncle used\r\nto resort to the uplands to shoot “partridge woodpeckers” and “brown\r\nbacks” (robins) among the bayberry bushes and sumacs. And flickers were\r\nslaughtered in large numbers in the South. Man was then the flicker’s\r\nworst enemy, but that is now all ancient history, as these birds are\r\nnow protected. But a new enemy has been introduced, which is probably\r\nworse than the old one. The European starling has come to compete with\r\nthe flicker in its search for a food supply. The starlings are now\r\nso abundant that they swoop down in flocks on the formerly plentiful\r\nsupply of wild fruits and berries, stripping the trees and bushes clean\r\nof the fruits on which the flickers and robins depended for their\r\nsummer and fall food. They also compete for nesting sites, fighting\r\nfor or usurping every available cavity, even driving the flickers\r\nfrom the homes that they had made. Lester W. Smith writes to me: “For\r\nseveral years after the starling became common in Connecticut, other\r\nbirds, especially the flicker, were seldom ejected, or not until all\r\navailable nesting possibilities about buildings were used and filled\r\nup. Never have I seen the flickers actually fight to retain their hole\r\nor bird house. On the sanctuary they were exceptionally noisy whenever\r\nstarlings attempted to take or had taken possession. On one occasion\r\nthree starlings took part; one remained in the entrance hole of the box\r\nand took dry grass that a second brought to it; the third chased off\r\neither of the pair of flickers, as it flew near the nest box, which\r\nwas about 8 feet from the ground on a sawed-off tree in a white-pine\r\ngrove. On shooting one of the starlings, the other four birds flew away\r\ntemporarily, and, on examination, I found a thin layer of grass over\r\nthe flicker’s eggs. In 15 minutes the starlings returned and a second\r\nwas shot. I removed the grass, and, hiding nearby, I saw nothing more\r\nof the third starling; but the flickers returned soon, took possession\r\nof the box, and later raised the five young.”\r\n\r\nSydney R. Taber (1921) tells an interesting story of a battle between\r\na male flicker and a pair of starlings for the possession of the\r\nflickers’ nest. The flicker had once pulled one of the starlings out of\r\nthe hole, but, during his absence, both of the starlings entered the\r\nhole.\r\n\r\n     On this second occasion, despairing of being able to pull\r\n     the two out at long range, so to speak, the Flicker also\r\n     plunged into the hole. Then followed a battle royal,\r\n     lasting for what seemed minutes. It was rather ghastly\r\n     to imagine the blows that were being dealt at closest\r\n     quarters; not a sound was emitted, but one could imagine\r\n     what was going on within the hole by the feathers that flew\r\n     from it. The first bird to emerge--that is, to be pushed\r\n     out, by fractions of an inch--was one of the Starlings,\r\n     which then flew away. The fight between the other two birds\r\n     then continued out of sight until something appeared at\r\n     the mouth of the hole. This proved to be the tail of the\r\n     Flicker. When he had backed out of the hole into view once\r\n     more, it appeared that he and the remaining Starling had\r\n     clinched in a desperate grapple. With the latter gripping\r\n     one of the wings of the Flicker, they fell, fluttering and\r\n     fighting, a distance of nearly 40 feet; but just before\r\n     touching the ground, they parted and flew in different\r\n     directions. * * *\r\n\r\n     The above events occurred a fortnight ago. Since then the\r\n     Starlings have been in full possession of the hole of\r\n     contention.\r\n\r\nFlickers figure largely in the food of duck hawks; their brightly\r\ncolored feathers are often found about the aeries. Other hawks\r\ntake their toll. O. A. Stevens sends me the following note on a\r\nsharp-shinned hawk attacking a flicker, perhaps only in sport: “The\r\nhawk settled in a partially dead, spreading pine tree, some 8 feet\r\nfrom the top. A flicker perched about 6 feet above him, apparently\r\nfrom curiosity. For some time they remained, the hawk sitting quietly,\r\npreening, occasionally casting a glance at the flicker. The latter\r\nteetered about on his perch, craning his neck at the hawk and even\r\ndropping down a foot or so. After at least 10 minutes, the hawk\r\nsuddenly darted at the flicker and away they went, the flicker twisting\r\nand escaping. It seems odd that an apparently heavy flier like a\r\nflicker would escape so easily.”\r\n\r\nMr. Burns (1903) adds the broad-winged hawk to the flicker’s enemies;\r\n“a nest of lusty young hawks examined in July, ’01, contained the\r\nprimaries and rectrices of one or two young Flickers, probably just\r\nout of the nest. * * * To the above Mr. Benj. T. Gault adds the\r\nBlacksnake--one having been killed and cut open by a farmer’s lad at a\r\nplace he was stopping at in Reynolds county, Missouri, contained the\r\nbody of one of these woodpeckers.” I have positively recorded flickers\r\nin the food of the marsh hawk, Cooper’s hawk, and red-shouldered\r\nhawk; probably they are killed by all the larger hawks and owls.\r\nTaverner and Swales (1907) say that the sharpshin flights at Point\r\nPelee discommoded the flickers less than any other species of small\r\nbirds. “Though at times they seemed uneasy and restless, they were\r\nperfectly able to take care of themselves and easily made their escape\r\nwhen attacked. * * * The usual course of procedure of the Flicker,\r\nwhen attacked by a hawk, was to wait until the last minute, when the\r\nhawk, in its swoop, was just about to seize its victim, and then dodge\r\nquickly to the other side of the limb. In every case observed the ruse\r\nworked perfectly, and we found only once the feather remains which\r\nproved that once in a while the hawk was a little too quick for the\r\nFlicker.”\r\n\r\nMr. Burns (1900) says that the eggs and young are sometimes destroyed\r\nby squirrels, weasels, mice, crows, jays, and the red-headed\r\nwoodpecker. Fred. H. Kennard records in his notes that a pair of\r\nflickers, nesting in one of his boxes, were robbed of their eggs by\r\nsome red squirrels, who ate the eggs in the box, built their own nest\r\nin the box, and brought in their young from another nest.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--As soon as the young are strong on the wing and the molting\r\nseason is over, the flickers, old and young, begin to gather into loose\r\nflocks or scattered parties, perhaps family parties, late in summer\r\nand early in fall. On cold, windy autumn days they may be found in\r\nclose companionship in hollows and sheltered localities in woodland\r\nclearings, protected from the cold winds, and feeding in the bayberry\r\npatches and clumps of staghorn sumac. At such times, they lie close and\r\ncan be easily approached.\r\n\r\nIn southern Canada and the Northern States, the great bulk of the\r\nflickers start to migrate in September, continuing to pass southward\r\nduring October. Mr. Burns (1900) says of the fall migration: “While the\r\nretrograde movements are conducted in larger numbers, being recruited\r\nby great numbers of birds of the year, it is scarcely as noticeable,\r\nlacking the noise and bustle of Spring arrivals. Like the Robin, its\r\nwhole nature seems to have undergone a change. It no longer solicits\r\nnotice by song or display, but becomes shy and suspicious, and while\r\ngregarious to a great extent, in flight every one is capable of looking\r\nout for itself. The mature birds are the most wary, and by example\r\nprepare the young for the dangers of migration and Winter residence in\r\nthe South, where it is constantly menaced by hunters.”\r\n\r\nDuring migration, they fly rather high, well above the treetops, in\r\nwidely detached flocks, often far apart, but keeping more or less in\r\ntouch with each other and sometimes fairly close together; hundreds\r\nmay be counted, as they pass in a steady stream for hours at a time.\r\nTaverner and Swales (1907) report heavy flights across Lake Erie from\r\nPoint Pelee: “During September it has always been one of the most\r\nabundant birds of the Point. Keays reports a flight in 1901 when he\r\nnoted four hundred September 21.” Long Point, which extends well out\r\nfrom the north shore of Lake Erie, is another favorite crossing place;\r\nhere, according to L. L. Snyder (1931), “the flight observed by Mr.\r\nJames Savage on September 30, 1930, was very remarkable, individuals\r\nestimated to be from one to two hundred yards apart, forming a\r\nscattered and straggling flock, passed in an almost steady stream\r\nthroughout the morning hours.”\r\n\r\nMr. Burns (1903) writes:\r\n\r\n     In south New Jersey, in the region of the Upper Delaware\r\n     Bay, which runs due south, some time in October of every\r\n     year the migrating Flickers are found flying north just\r\n     previous to and during a northwest storm. At this time the\r\n     wind is generally high and the birds fly against it. This\r\n     peculiarity of flight affects a large territory extending\r\n     inland from the east shore of the bay some fifteen or\r\n     twenty miles. While the birds prefer to breast a wind,\r\n     it is also probable that they are reluctant to cross the\r\n     lower part of the bay during such a storm which would\r\n     tend to drive them seaward, rather preferring to return\r\n     northward to the more narrow river where they could cross\r\n     in comparative safety.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Winter finds most of the flickers gone from the northern\r\nStates and southern Canada. Most of the birds wintering in New England\r\nseek the milder climate of the seacoast, where they feed in the\r\nextensive bayberry patches and on the semidormant insect life in the\r\nrows of drift seaweed along the beaches. The few that remain inland\r\nduring mild winters are usually to be found in sheltered hollows or\r\nalong the sunny sides of the woods, feeding on the ground or on what\r\nberries and dry fruits still remain on the bushes, often in company\r\nwith merry little winter parties of juncos, tree sparrows, chickadees,\r\nnuthatches, and perhaps a downy or hairy woodpecker. Favorite resorts\r\nat that season are the southern slopes of the hills overgrown with\r\nthick stands of red cedars, mixed with staghorn sumacs, barberries,\r\nand other berry-bearing bushes. They probably seek shelter at night in\r\nthe dense cedar swamps or in the holes excavated for that purpose in\r\nicehouses or other buildings, or in hollow trees.\r\n\r\nL. H. Walkinshaw, of Battle Creek, Mich., writes to me that there, “in\r\ndeep winter, flickers can be found in the deep tamarack swamps, coming\r\nto the edge during periods of the day. They often flush, even when snow\r\nis deep, from mounds on the ground or from dead or dying stubs along\r\nthe border.”\r\n\r\nO. A. Stevens says in his notes: “At my farm home in Kansas, the\r\nflickers caused some annoyance by seeking entrance to the barn for\r\nwinter nights. They enlarged other openings for this purpose and\r\nsometimes started openings which would not lead them inside. One bird\r\nat least, enlarged the opening about the hayfork track and roosted on\r\nthe iron track just inside the door.”\r\n\r\nDr. Paul L. Errington (1936) writes an interesting story on the\r\nwinter-killing of flickers in central Iowa. By a careful study of\r\nthe droppings of the three birds that he studied, it appeared that\r\nthey were much weakened by improper food, too large a proportion of\r\nindigestible seeds, mainly those of the sumac, and not enough animal\r\nfood, which ordinarily amounts to more than half of the average food\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nM. P. Skinner (1928), writing of the Sandhills of North Carolina,\r\nsays: “Flickers stay in the Sandhills all winter, but the infrequent\r\nsnowstorms cause them lots of trouble in finding food. On January\r\n10, 1927, I found quite a little coterie of birds had scratched the\r\nleaves under a dogwood tree until they had a space twelve feet in\r\ndiameter more or less cleared of snow. Here, among other species of\r\nbirds, were two Flickers foraging among the leaves for fallen dogwood\r\nberries. These berries were probably eaten until weather conditions\r\nbecame better for insect catching. Even during winter, ants are fairly\r\nplentiful for the Sandhill Flickers, especially on warm days.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    COLAPTES CAFER COLLARIS Vigors\r\n\r\n                          RED-SHAFTED FLICKER\r\n\r\n                               PLATE 37\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThis western representative of our well-known eastern flicker is so\r\nclosely related to it and so similar to it in all its habits that\r\npractically all that has been written about the northern flicker\r\nwould apply equally well to the red-shafted species. The two differ\r\nstrikingly in coloration, but the color pattern is similar in both,\r\nand the fact that they interbreed so freely and extensively where\r\ntheir ranges come together shows their close relationship. The only\r\ndifferences in their habitats, nesting, and feeding habits are due to\r\nthe differences in environments.\r\n\r\nThe red-shafted flicker is a wide-ranging species through many types\r\nof open country or sparsely wooded regions, from the Rocky Mountains\r\nto sea level on the Pacific coast. It is a common bird near human\r\nhabitations in thinly settled towns and villages and in agricultural\r\nregions, as well as in the wilder foothills and mountain slopes up to\r\ntimberline, but not on the treeless plains or deserts. The Weydemeyers\r\n(1928), referring to its haunts in northwestern Montana, give a good\r\nidea of its habitat there, which would doubtless apply equally well\r\nthroughout its range elsewhere; they say: “The Flicker is most abundant\r\nabout farms and in cut-over woods, nesting commonly near barnyards and\r\nin pastures. An observer will note fewer and fewer individuals as he\r\npasses from cultivated farms into stump-lands; from there to virgin\r\nforests of fir, larch, and yellow pine; thence into the lodgepole pine\r\nand white pine woods of the lower part of the Canadian zone; and onward\r\ninto denser forests of alpine fir, spruce, and arborvitae. But he will\r\nfind the birds increasing in numbers on the rocky mountain slopes\r\nand upward through the Hudsonian zone, where the species ranges to\r\ntimberline.”\r\n\r\nMilton P. Skinner says in his Yellowstone Park notes: “This bird is\r\nfound at all elevations from the lowest at 5,300 feet to timberline at\r\n9,500 feet, and in practically all kinds of habitat except the largest\r\nopens, and even there I have seen it flying across from side to side.\r\nIt is in the sagebrush areas, in the borderland between forest and\r\nopen, in detached groves, and even in heavy forest.\r\n\r\n“They are often seen on the ground, especially in May, but also in June\r\nand July. Sometimes they are in the road. I have seen them frequently\r\nin the grass and perched on a bowlder or a prostrate log. In addition\r\nto these treeless and brushless localities, I often see flickers on the\r\nground under sagebrushes and greasewood; on the ground in a grove of\r\ncedars and limber pines; under aspens, willows, cedars, firs and on\r\nthe ground amid the stumps of a former fir forest. I have-seen them in\r\ngroves of mixed lodgepole pines and aspens and in meadows where there\r\nwere only groves of willow bushes.”\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--In the same notes Mr. Skinner says: “On April 29, 1915, I\r\nsaw a pair of flickers ‘dancing.’ They were on a dead lodgepole, and\r\nalthough there was not much movement of the feet, the body was bent\r\nfrom side to side and there was a constant ‘juggling’ or ‘jigging’\r\nmotion. The head was tilted back and the bill pointed up at an angle\r\nof sixty degrees, with the neck outstretched. The neck, head, and\r\nbill were in constant motion; the motion of the bill reminded me of a\r\nmusical director’s baton. Intervals of rest alternated with periods of\r\nmotion; the whole thing lasted perhaps 5 minutes.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Major Bendire (1895) says on this subject:\r\n\r\n     Its favorite nesting sites are old rotten stubs or trees,\r\n     such as cottonwoods, willows, sycamores, junipers, oaks,\r\n     and pines. It nests also in holes in banks, in the sides of\r\n     houses, in gate posts, etc. * * *\r\n\r\n     Among some peculiar nesting sites of this species the\r\n     following deserve mention:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Walter B. Bryant gives the following: “One of these\r\n     was in a bridge bulkhead, a few feet above the Carson\r\n     River, Nevada. The interior of the structure was filled\r\n     with gravel and large stones, among which the eggs\r\n     were deposited. Another pair used a target butt, at a\r\n     much-frequented range, as a substitute for a stump. A third\r\n     nest was in a sand bank, 3 feet from the top and 10 from\r\n     the creek. This hole was apparently specially prepared,\r\n     and not one made by a ground squirrel, such holes being\r\n     sometimes used by these birds.”\r\n\r\n     Mr. Charles A. Allen, of Nicasio, Calif., found a pair of\r\n     red-shafted flickers nesting in a similar situation in a\r\n     creek bank, the burrow containing seven eggs, which he\r\n     took. About ten days later, happening to pass the same\r\n     spot, he examined the hole again and found it occupied by a\r\n     California Screech Owl, which in the meantime had deposited\r\n     four eggs. Some two weeks subsequently he examined it for\r\n     a third time, and on this occasion the tenant proved to be\r\n     a Sparrow Hawk, which was setting on five handsome eggs.\r\n     There was no nesting material present on any occasion, the\r\n     eggs lying on some loose dirt.\r\n\r\nOthers have noted the bank-nesting habit of this flicker, which seems\r\nto be rather common. Most of the nests, however, are excavated in\r\ntrees or stubs, at heights varying from ground level to 100 feet above\r\nthe ground. We found them nesting commonly in the Huachuca Mountains,\r\nAriz., in the sycamores in the canyons and in the tall pines near the\r\nsummits at 9,000 feet. A large majority of the nests will be found\r\nbetween 8 and 25 feet above the ground. Dawson (1923) mentions a nest\r\n“in a stump only two feet high, and its eggs rested virtually upon\r\nthe ground.” Walter P. Taylor (1912) mentions a nest in a cavity in\r\na haystack, in the desert regions of Humboldt County, Nev., where\r\nthere were practically no trees. This flicker also nests frequently in\r\ntelegraph and other poles, also far too often in buildings, where it\r\ndrills a hole through the outer wall and lays its eggs on a beam or\r\nother flat surface, accumulating enough chips to keep the eggs from\r\nrolling.\r\n\r\nFlorence A. Merriam Bailey (1896) watched a red-shafted flicker\r\nexcavating its nest-hole, of which she says: “The flicker hung with\r\nclaws planted in the hole, and with its tail braced at an angle under\r\nit, leaned forward to excavate. Using its feet as a pivot, it gradually\r\nswung in farther and farther; and when it had gone so far that it had\r\nto reach back to throw out its chips, it swung in and out on its feet\r\nlike an automatic toy wound up for the performance. When it had been\r\nbuilding for a week, only the tip of its tail protruded from the nest\r\nhole as it worked.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Irene G. Wheelock (1904) says: “The site having been chosen, the\r\nmale clings to the surface and marks with his bill a more or less\r\nregular circle in a series of dots, then begins excavating inside this\r\narea, using his bill, not with a sidewise twist, as do many of the\r\nwoodpecker family, but striking downwards and prying off the chips as\r\nwith a pickaxe. When his mate has rested and wishes to share in the\r\nlabor, she calls from a near-by tree and he instantly quits his task.”\r\n\r\nDr. and Mrs. Grinnell (Grinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale, 1930) made the\r\nfollowing observations on this species, while excavating its nest-hole:\r\n\r\n     The bird entered the hole, entirely out of view, at 8:54,\r\n     reappeared from within at 9:05, when it rested a minute\r\n     with the head partly out; then it proceeded to bring out\r\n     from within load after load of chips, which showered\r\n     down as if of fine, almost sawdust-like size. Forty-five\r\n     such loads were counted to 9:10, delivered with striking\r\n     regularity. Twelve loads delivered were counted in one\r\n     sixty-second period. At 9:10 the bird disappeared again\r\n     till 9:15, when its head appeared and twenty-seven loads\r\n     were flipped out in three minutes; then after a long pause,\r\n     till 9:19, the other flicker arrived, with scythe-whetting\r\n     note, and both birds flew off. One of them returned at\r\n     9:29, flipped out several loads of chips and left at 9:31.\r\n     Digging in this particular stump must have been easy and\r\n     hence rapid.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The red-shafted flicker lays five to twelve eggs to a set.\r\nProbably, if the experiment were tried, it would prove to be as\r\nprolific an egg layer as its eastern relative, though I have found no\r\nevidence to that effect. The eggs are indistinguishable from those of\r\nthe northern flicker. The measurements of 57 eggs average 28.18 by\r\n21.85 millimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =35.56=\r\nby 20.32, 27.94 by =24.89=, =25.40= by 20.83, and 27.68 by =19.30=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n_Young._--Mrs. Wheelock (1904) says of the young: “For nearly three\r\nweeks they are fed by regurgitation, and after that time the insects\r\nbrought are masticated by the parents. * * *\r\n\r\n“After they are old enough to leave the nursery, they follow their\r\nparents about for nearly two weeks, begging to be fed and gradually\r\nlearning to hunt for themselves. This lesson is wisely taught by the\r\nparents, who place the food under a crevice in the bark, in full sight\r\nof the young, who must pick it out or go hungry. The baby cocks his\r\nhead wisely, looks at it, and proceeds to pull it out and dine.”\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--The sequence of plumages and molts, from fledgling to\r\nadult, in the red-shafted flicker is similar to that of the northern\r\nflicker, but there is one marked difference in the color pattern in the\r\njuvenal plumage; whereas in _auratus_ young birds of both sexes have\r\nblack malar patches, in _cafer_ only the young male has the red malar\r\npatches. Kidgway (1914) describes the juvenal male of the red-shafted\r\nflicker as “similar to the adult male, but coloration duller, gray of\r\nthroat, etc., duller, more brownish, black jugular patch smaller and\r\nless sharply defined, black spots on under parts less sharply defined,\r\nless rounded, feathers of pileum indistinctly tipped with paler, and\r\nred malar stripes less bright, less uniform, and black terminal area on\r\nunder side of tail not sharply defined.” The young female is similar to\r\nthe young male, but the malar region is grayish brown instead of red.\r\nThe juvenal plumage is worn through summer, and a complete molt during\r\nfall produces a first-winter plumage that is practically adult. Adults\r\nhave a complete annual molt late in summer and fall.\r\n\r\nA most interesting and unique case, among American birds at least, of\r\nhybridizing on an extensive scale over a wide region occurs between\r\n_Colaptes auratus_ and _Colaptes cafer_. We found this most beautifully\r\nillustrated in southwestern Saskatchewan, where pure-blooded birds of\r\nboth species were taken, together with quite a series of hybrid birds\r\nshowing all the intermediate grades of plumage. Almost all the males\r\nshowed some traces of the red malar stripes of _cafer_, and nearly all\r\nshowed some traces of the red nuchal crescent of _auratus_; the other\r\ncharacters seemed to be less constant. I collected a pure-blooded\r\nmale _auratus_ and a nearly pure-blooded _cafer_ female, which were\r\napparently mated. And two young in juvenal plumage, one almost pure\r\n_cafer_ and the other equally near _auratus_, were taken from the same\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nAlthough the general color _patterns_ of the two species are strikingly\r\nsimilar, or parallel, the characters that separate them are radically\r\nqualitative rather than quantitative, so that the numerous hybrids\r\ncannot by any means be considered as intermediates between subspecies.\r\nNo two species of a genus could well present more striking contrasts in\r\n_coloration_ in such similar patterns.\r\n\r\nIn one species the quills are red, in the other yellow; the male has a\r\nred malar stripe in one and a black stripe in the other; neither sex\r\nin _cafer_ has the red nuchal crescent, while both sexes have it in\r\n_auratus_; _cafer_ has the throat and fore neck gray and the top of the\r\nhead and hind neck brown, while these colors are reversed in _auratus_.\r\nThese contrasting colors may be blended or mixed in an almost endless\r\nvariety of patterns in the hybrids; and the patterns are often\r\nasymmetrical, the opposite sides of the bird being quite different.\r\nSome specimens of _cafer_ show the first traces of _auratus_ blood by\r\nthe presence of a few black feathers in the malar stripe, or traces of\r\nthe red nuchal crescent. Slight traces of _cafer_ blood in _auratus_\r\nappear with a mixture of red in the black malar strip, or with a tinge\r\nof orange or reddish in the wings or tail. Between these two extremes\r\nthere is every degree of blending or mixture of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor many years after these interesting hybrids were discovered and\r\ndescribed by Baird (1858), they were known only from the upper Missouri\r\nand Yellowstone River region. Later they were found to be widely\r\ndistributed from the western border of the Great Plains westward to\r\nthe Pacific coast, and from Texas to southern Canada. While the center\r\nof abundance of birds showing thoroughly mixed characters seems to lie\r\nbetween the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, evidence of hybrid\r\nblood is much more widely dispersed in a gradually diminishing degree,\r\nmore strongly westward and to a lesser degree eastward. Dr. J. A.\r\nAllen (1892), in his excellent paper on this subject, says: “Specimens\r\nwith a slight amount of red in the malar stripe are represented in the\r\nmaterial I have examined from Massachusetts, Long Island, New Jersey\r\n(five specimens), Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida (several), Louisiana\r\n(several), Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois (several), Michigan\r\n(two), and Minnesota. They seem to be quite as frequent along the\r\nAtlantic seaboard as at any point east of the Mississippi River.”\r\n\r\n_Food._--Professor Beal’s (1910) study of 118 stomachs of the two\r\nwestern races of the red-shafted flicker showed that 54 percent of the\r\nfood was animal and 46 percent vegetable matter. Of the animal food,\r\nbeetles constituted 3 percent, most of which were harmful; there were\r\nonly a few predatory carabids; ants made up 45 percent of the year’s\r\nfood; other Hymenoptera totaled 1 percent, and miscellaneous items,\r\nsuch as caterpillars, crickets, and spiders, amounted to 5 percent of\r\nthe food.\r\n\r\nOf the vegetable food, acorns formed 10 percent of the yearly food;\r\ngrains, including rye, corn, barley, and oats, amounted to 4 percent;\r\nfruits, averaging 15 percent, included pears, apples, grapes, cherries,\r\nand prunes; and the other 17 percent was made up of wild fruits, such\r\nas pepperberries, elderberries, and gooseberries and the seeds of the\r\npoison oak and sumac and of a few weeds. He says of the poison-oak\r\nseeds:\r\n\r\n     The consumption of these seeds would be a decided benefit\r\n     to man if they were ground up and destroyed in the\r\n     stomachs. Unfortunately they are either regurgitated or\r\n     pass through the intestinal tract uninjured and ready to\r\n     germinate. The action of the stomach simply removes the\r\n     outer covering, a white, wax-like substance, which is\r\n     probably very nutritious, and is evidently relished by many\r\n     birds. Birds are probably the most active agents in the\r\n     dissemination of these noxious shrubs. On the other hand,\r\n     these seeds, which are wonderfully abundant, afford food\r\n     for thousands of birds during the winter, when other food\r\n     is hard to obtain, and thus enable the birds to tide over\r\n     the cold season to do their good work of destroying insects\r\n     the next summer.\r\n\r\nJohnson A. Neff (1928) says that “in a great many instances they are\r\nknown to feed on the larvæ of the codling moth”; and that “ants were\r\nthe largest item of food for the year, averaging 40.30%, taken during\r\nevery month; several stomachs held over 2,000 each, and many of them\r\ncontained over 500.” Among the vegetable food he lists manzanita\r\nberries and seeds and such wild fruits as madrona, dogwood, haw,\r\nserviceberry, elderberry, Oregon crab, and huckleberry; seeds of poison\r\noak averaged 7.5 percent, but in December the percentage was 33.3.\r\n\r\nReferring to the fruit-eating habits of this flicker in Los Angeles\r\nCounty, Calif., Robert S. Woods (1932) writes:\r\n\r\n     Fortunately for the grower, and perhaps for the birds as\r\n     well, the rind of an orange is impervious to the attacks\r\n     of any ordinary bird, though when once opened the fruit is\r\n     well liked by many of them. Only the Red-shafted Flicker\r\n     (_Colaptes cafer collaris_) is able to chisel through the\r\n     tough skin; after making a round opening large enough for\r\n     the insertion of its bill, it scoops out a large portion\r\n     of the pulp with its tongue. Examples of this sort of\r\n     damage, however, are infrequent and usually, as it seems,\r\n     in oranges which have fallen to the ground, where they are\r\n     more easily reached.\r\n\r\n     The flicker’s attacks on avocados appear more serious,\r\n     though this is partly due to the smaller numbers of the\r\n     fruit available. Avocados which hang near a convenient\r\n     perch are often found to have a roughly circular hole\r\n     extending through to the seed. In a few of the fruits these\r\n     holes have been considerably enlarged, but usually they are\r\n     not much larger than the base of the bird’s bill.\r\n\r\nJack C. von Bloeker, Jr. (1935), saw three red-shafted flickers capture\r\nscarab “beetles in flycatcher fashion. In each case, the bird attained\r\na position behind its intended victim, then, taking up the erratic\r\nzigzag course of the beetle, suddenly swooped down and captured it in\r\nmid-air.”\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) also says: “Besides the usual insects and larvæ\r\nupon which this species feeds, I have seen it catch grasshoppers, both\r\non the ground and on the wing, and it is likewise very fond of wild\r\nstrawberries.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--I can find nothing in the behavior or general habits of\r\nthe red-shafted flicker that is essentially different from the habits\r\nof the northern flicker. It has the same annoying habit of drumming on\r\nthe resonant parts of dwellings at early hours in the morning, which\r\nis quite disturbing to sleepers. It also does considerable damage\r\nto buildings by drilling holes in the eaves or walls for nesting or\r\nroosting places, spending winter nights or even stormy days in such\r\nsheltered retreats. John G. Tyler (1913) says on this subject:\r\n\r\n     Unfortunately these handsome birds have fallen into\r\n     disfavor among a large number of both city dwellers and\r\n     country residents, on account of their habit of drilling\r\n     holes in the gable ends of buildings. When once a house\r\n     has been selected it seems that nothing short of death\r\n     will cause them to cease their drilling operations until\r\n     one, and in some cases three or four, holes have been\r\n     cut through the outer wall of the building. Whether\r\n     these holes, which are generally made in the winter, are\r\n     excavated for roosting places or simply through a sort of\r\n     nervous energy seems a matter of doubt; but certain it is\r\n     that the birds spend much time in them as soon as they\r\n     succeed in completing their work. It is a common sight, on\r\n     rainy days, to see a Flicker’s head peering out from his\r\n     open doorway.\r\n\r\nThe speed in flight of the red-shafted flicker has been recorded as\r\nfrom 25 to 27 miles an hour, as measured with the speedometer of an\r\nautomobile.\r\n\r\nGrinnell and Storer (1924) write of its habits:\r\n\r\n     The tramper in almost any part of the Yosemite region\r\n     can hardly fail to at least hear one or more Red-shafted\r\n     Flickers in a half-day’s circuit. Although these birds are\r\n     never seen in true flocks, he may flush from favorable\r\n     places as many as 6 of them within a few yards. This is\r\n     particularly true on the floor of Yosemite Valley during\r\n     the autumn months. This omnivorous woodpecker then almost\r\n     completely forsakes the timber and forages in the brush\r\n     patches, eating berries of various sorts, especially\r\n     cascara; it often seeks the open meadows where it gathers\r\n     ants and grasshoppers.\r\n\r\n     The birds flush one or two at a time, often not until the\r\n     observer is almost upon them; then the sudden flapping of\r\n     broad pinkish-red wings, the view of the white rump patch\r\n     fully displayed, leave no doubt in the observer’s mind as\r\n     to the identity. A bird seldom flies far before alighting,\r\n     not against an upright tree trunk as with most other\r\n     woodpeckers, but perching on a branch, to bow deeply this\r\n     way and that and perhaps utter its explosive _claip_.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The notes of the red-shafted flicker are almost identical\r\nwith those of the northern flicker, though George F. Simmons (1925)\r\nevidently thinks that the voice is “much coarser, rougher, and heavier,\r\n* * * easily distinguished when the two are heard calling near each\r\nother.”\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The white rump is the most conspicuous recognition\r\nmark for both species, and the color _pattern_ is similar for both,\r\nbut the flashing colors in the wings and tail, as well as the other\r\ncontrasting colors, will serve to distinguish the red-shafted from the\r\nyellow-shafted species.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--During the winter that I spent in Pasadena, flickers were\r\ncommon or abundant all winter in an arroyo on the outskirts of the\r\ncity. I could always find them picking up food among the dry leaves on\r\nthe ground, or flying about among the large sycamores and live oaks.\r\nOn a bright, sunny morning, after a frosty night, they could be seen\r\nperched in the topmost branches of the tallest trees, which were the\r\nfirst to catch the warmth of the rising sun. On February 14, 1929, I\r\nsaw two males perched close together facing each other, bowing and\r\nnodding, or bobbing up and down, as if beginning to feel the urge of\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Western North America south to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.\r\n\r\n_Breeding range._--The red-shafted flicker breeds =north= to\r\nsoutheastern Alaska (Sitka and Portage Cove); central British Columbia\r\n(158-mile House and Horse Lake); west-central Alberta (Jasper House);\r\nsouthern Saskatchewan (Cypress Hills); and North Dakota (Fort Union,\r\nOakdale, and Fort Clark). =East= to central North Dakota (Fort Clark);\r\nSouth Dakota (Reliance and Yankton); northwestern Nebraska (Chadron);\r\nColorado (Fort Morgan, Denver, Colorado Springs, and Beulah); extreme\r\nwestern Oklahoma (Kenton); central New Mexico (Santa Fe, Cloudcroft,\r\nand Mesilla); western Chihuahua (San Luis Mountains and Pinos Altos);\r\nDurango (Rio Sestin, Arroyo del Buey, and Durango City); Tamaulipas\r\n(Ciudad Victoria); Hilaygo (Real del Monte); Vera Cruz (Jalapa and\r\nOrizaba); and eastern Oaxaca (Villa Alta and Totontepec). =South= to\r\nOaxaca (Totontepec); Guerrero (Omilteme); and Jalisco (Zapotlan and\r\nVolcan de Colima). From this southwestern point the species ranges\r\nnorth through the mountains of western Mexico, including northern\r\nBaja California and (formerly) Guadalupe Island, California, Oregon,\r\nWashington, and British Columbia, to southeastern Alaska (Sitka).\r\n\r\n_Winter range._--The red-shafted flicker is a resident species over\r\nmost of its range, withdrawing from the more northern parts only\r\nduring severe winters. At this season it is found =north= regularly to\r\nsouthern British Columbia (Comox, Okanagan, and Edgewood); northern\r\nMontana (Fortine and Great Falls); eastern Wyoming (Midwest); and\r\nrarely southeastern South Dakota (Yankton).\r\n\r\nThe range as outlined applies to the entire species, of which four\r\nsubspecies or geographic races are now recognized. The typical form,\r\nknown as the northwestern flicker (_Colaptes c. cafer_), is found\r\nin the northern Pacific coast regions from southeastern Alaska and\r\nwestern British Columbia south to northern California. The red-shafted\r\nflicker (_C. c. collaris_) occurs over all the remaining parts of\r\nthe range except for certain mountainous areas in northern Baja\r\nCalifornia and Guadalupe Island, occupied by the San Pedro flicker\r\n(_C. c. martirensis_) and the now extinct Guadalupe flicker (_C. c.\r\nrufipileus_).\r\n\r\n_Migration._--Such migratory movements as are made by this species\r\ncannot be satisfactorily portrayed by the use of dates. The most\r\nconspicuous migration is vertical rather than lateral, for during\r\nfall and winter in the eastern part of the range there is a more or\r\nless well-defined movement east from the Rocky Mountain region onto\r\nthe Great Plains. At these seasons the species may travel eastward to\r\nIowa (Forest City, Boone, and Des Moines); Missouri (Kansas City);\r\nArkansas (Van Buren); southeastern Oklahoma (Caddo); and eastern Texas\r\n(Gainesville, Waco, Somerset, and Brownsville).\r\n\r\n_Spring migration._--In the northern part of the breeding range, from\r\nwhich the species appears to withdraw in winter with more or less\r\nregularity, the following are early dates of spring arrival: South\r\nDakota--White River, March 28; Yankton, April 1. North Dakota--McKenzie\r\nCounty, March 31; Arnegard, April 11. Alberta--Banff, April 3; Warner,\r\nApril 24; Edmonton, April 29. Alaska--Kupreanof Island, April 12.\r\n\r\n_Fall migration._--Late dates of departure from northern areas\r\nare: Alaska--Wrangell, November 26. Alberta--Jasper, September 8;\r\nHenry House, September 22. North Dakota--Grafton, October 7 (one\r\nwas collected in the Red River Valley on December 6, 1924). South\r\nDakota--Faulkton, October 15.\r\n\r\nAlthough red-shafted flickers have been banded in considerable numbers,\r\nthe Biological Survey files do not contain any data indicative of an\r\nextensive flight from the point of banding. There are, however, many\r\ncases of recapture in succeeding seasons at the banding station.\r\n\r\n_Casual records._--Among the few records where this species has been\r\ncollected or observed outside its normal range are the following: One\r\nwas taken at Grafton, N. Dak., April 19, 1925, and another was shot\r\nnear Winnipeg, Manitoba, September 30, 1904. There are two records for\r\nnorthern Alberta, one at Fort Chipewyan, May 21, 1893, and the other\r\nat Smiths Portage, June 8, 1908. Other records, some of which are\r\nfrom points farther east (as Minnesota), are for hybrids between this\r\nspecies and _C. auratus_.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--British Columbia: 13 records, May 8 to June 7; 7\r\n    records, May 14 to 26, indicating the height of the season.\r\n  California: 75 records, April 9 to July 2; 38 records, May 3 to 28.\r\n  Colorado: 22 records, May 5 to July 1; 11 records, May 22 to 31.\r\n  Guadalupe Island: 6 records, April 8 to June 8.\r\n  Oregon: 33 records, May 3 to June 12; 17 records, May 12 to June 1.\r\n  Washington: 17 records, April 29 to June 10; 9 records, May 12 to 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     COLAPTES CAFER CAFER (Gmelin)\r\n\r\n                         NORTHWESTERN FLICKER\r\n\r\n                               PLATE 38\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe northwestern flicker was formerly known as _Colaptes cafer\r\nsaturatior_ Ridgway, type locality Neah Bay, Wash. But it has since\r\nbeen learned that Gmelin’s name _Picus cafer_ was based on a bird taken\r\nat Bay of Good Hope, Nootka Sound, British Columbia. As this locality\r\nis well within the range of the northwestern flicker, Gmelin’s name has\r\npriority over Ridgway’s _saturatior_.\r\n\r\nThis larger and more richly colored race of _Colaptes cafer_ inhabits\r\nthe humid Northwest coast region, from Sitka, Alaska, to northern\r\nCalifornia, Humboldt County, including most of southern British\r\nColumbia east to the Kootenay district. It is not only larger than\r\n_Colaptes cafer collaris_, but its upper parts are browner and its\r\nunder parts are more strongly suffused with vinaceous.\r\n\r\nD. E. Brown writes to me that this “is the common woodpecker of western\r\nWashington. It will outnumber all the other woodpeckers two to one.”\r\nReferring to its haunts on Mount Rainier, Taylor and Shaw (1927)\r\nsay: “As the noisiest and most conspicuous, adaptable, and broadly\r\ndistributed woodpecker in the park, the flicker is bound to achieve\r\nsome notoriety. It avoids the dark woods, and undoubtedly prefers the\r\ntracts of dead stubs which are encountered at fairly frequent intervals\r\naround the mountain; for here both nesting sites and food are present\r\nin great abundance.”\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) says that “in western Oregon, and probably also in\r\nnorthwestern California, it appears to be found only on the summits of\r\nthe different mountains between the Cascades and the coast during the\r\nbreeding season, where the same moist climate prevails as is found in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the coast, while in the drier lowlands, such\r\nas the Umpqua, Rogue, and Willamette river valleys, it is replaced by”\r\n_Colaptes cafer collaris_.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--The nesting habits of the northwestern flicker do not seem\r\nto differ materially from those of its close relative farther south.\r\nD. E. Brown tells me that this bird “will nest anywhere where there is\r\nroom to dig out a cavity large enough for the nest. I have found them\r\nin large stumps and in fenceposts and from 18 inches from the ground\r\nto 100 feet up. They will nest in birdboxes of suitable size and will\r\nuse them for winter homes. The eggs are from 5 to 10 in number and may\r\nbe found May 1 to August. Both birds incubate and, when incubation is\r\nadvanced, sit very close; sometimes they are removed by hand.”\r\n\r\nHarry S. Swarth (1911a) reports a nest, found at Portage Cove,\r\nRevillagigedo Island, Alaska, that “was in a dead stub, some fifty feet\r\nfrom the ground. The stump was so rotten that an attempt to climb it\r\nbrought down the whole upper portion, including the nest, in a mass\r\nof disintegrated punk. * * * The nest tree was in a valley bordering\r\na stream, in fairly open country, with clumps of scattered timber\r\ninterspersed between the open meadows.”\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The eggs of this race are indistinguishable from those of the\r\nred-shafted flicker, except for a slight average difference in size.\r\nThe measurements of 47 eggs average 29.37 by 22.37 millimeters; the\r\neggs showing the four extremes measure =32.0= by 23.4, 30.6 by =24.3=,\r\nand =26.4= by =20.8= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Food._--What has been said about the food of the red-shafted flicker,\r\nand to a large extent that of the northern flicker, would apply equally\r\nwell to the northwestern. D. E. Brown says in his notes: “It puts in\r\nmost of its time feeding on the ground and becomes quite tame around\r\nhouses. I once placed some cornmeal on the back porch for some small\r\nbirds. A flicker lit on the porch and, approaching the meal, laid its\r\nhead sideways nearly on the floor and ran its long tongue through the\r\nmeal several times; it then turned its head over and repeated the\r\noperation from the other side, leaving a checkered effect on the meal.”\r\n\r\nTheed Pearse writes to me from Vancouver Island that he has seen “a\r\nflicker picking up grains of rolled-oats off a flat surface by a\r\nsideways action of the beak.” Flickers at his feeding station fed on\r\napples, but seemed to prefer suet or fat.\r\n\r\nS. F. Rathbun, of Seattle, has sent me the following interesting note:\r\n“On one occasion in November I watched a northwestern flicker for more\r\nthan an hour feeding on a closely cut lawn in our yard. At different\r\ntimes it had visited the spot, and I became somewhat curious to know\r\nwhat the food represented that the bird found. This time as soon as\r\nthe woodpecker alighted it commenced tapping rapidly with its beak the\r\nsurface of the lawn, from time to time driving its bill into the earth.\r\nThen when this was withdrawn oftener than not it held an earthworm\r\nor some large grub, which at once was eaten and then the tapping\r\nrecommenced. On two occasions I could plainly see that its prey was\r\ncutworms. But what was of particular interest was the painstaking way\r\nin which the flicker worked over every inch of the small space to which\r\nit confined its attentions, for the spot was not larger than 10 by 15\r\nfeet, and this was gone over again and again. During the time I watched\r\nthe flicker it captured more than a dozen earthworms, all of which were\r\nof good size, and also eight cutworms. Another action of the bird while\r\nit was hunting caught my attention. At odd times it would vigorously\r\nscratch the surface of the lawn as if to uncover some prey, and I\r\nnoticed that each time this took place, a worm would be pulled from the\r\nearth by the bird.”\r\n\r\nHe says further, in a letter, regarding this observation: “At the\r\ntime we watched it, the bird was so close we had difficulty at times\r\nin using the field glasses, so could readily see what it obtained.\r\nSometimes it would pull an angleworm from the ground very much as a\r\nrobin does, the worm stretched out to quite an extent.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--There is nothing peculiar in the behavior of this flicker\r\nthat would not apply to its close relatives equally well. But J. Hooper\r\nBowles (1926) had his attention called in an interesting way to the\r\nregularity of its habits in going to roost. He was calling on a friend\r\none afternoon in the fall of 1924, of which he writes: “I happened to\r\nremark that it was half past three, when my friend answered quickly,\r\n‘In five minutes it will be bedtime for our Flicker.’ This somewhat\r\nastonished me, but we went outside the house and took a station where\r\nwe could command a good view of a certain section of the eaves of\r\nthe house. Sure enough, in about five minutes a Northwestern Flicker\r\nswooped up and hung itself woodpecker-fashion against a board under the\r\neaves, where it composed itself for spending the night. The bird had\r\nbeen doing this with absolute regularity for some time, although it was\r\nof course broad daylight and bright sunshine.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  COLAPTES CAFER MARTIRENSIS Grinnell\r\n\r\n                           SAN PEDRO FLICKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nUnder the above name, Dr. Joseph Grinnell (1927b) has separated and\r\ndescribed the red-shafted flicker of the Sierra San Pedro Martir region\r\nof northern Baja California. He describes it as follows:\r\n\r\n     Similar in general characters to _Colaptes cafer collaris_\r\n     Vigors (topotypes from Monterey, California), but averaging\r\n     slightly smaller, bill more attenuated (especially more\r\n     compressed in terminal half), and tone of ground color on\r\n     head and on upper and lower surfaces in fresh plumage much\r\n     more gray (rather than brown or vinaceous). * * *\r\n\r\n     The relative depth and clearness of the gray on the throat\r\n     and sides of head and neck in _martirensis_ is a nearly\r\n     constant character, as is also the deep fuscous (of\r\n     Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, 1912,\r\n     pl. XLVI) tone of the back and of the top of the head,\r\n     in fresh, new plumage: on the sides of the body, and on\r\n     the chest surrounding the big black bar, there is little\r\n     hint of the bright vinaceous tinting that characterizes\r\n     _collaris_ from throughout upper California. Weathering\r\n     of the plumage toward spring tends to rob _martirensis_\r\n     of its most characteristic color tones, especially on the\r\n     top of the head which then becomes warmer brown, but not,\r\n     however, to the degree of brightness seen in _rufipileus_.\r\n     The latter is even browner than _collaris_.\r\n\r\nHe gives, as its range: “Sierra San Pedro Martir (San José, 2,500 feet,\r\nnear La Grulla at 7,200 feet, and near Vallecitos at 7,500 feet) and\r\nSierra Juárez (Laguna Hanson, 5,200 feet).” Elsewhere (1928b), he calls\r\nit a “common resident on the western slopes of the Sierra Juárez and\r\nSierra San Pedro Martír; in winter invading westwardly to the seacoast.\r\nBreeds in Upper Sonoran and Transition zones.”\r\n\r\nIts habits are probably similar to those of the species elsewhere.\r\n\r\nGriffing Bancroft has sent me the measurements of a set of eight eggs,\r\nwhich average 26.87 by 22.16 millimeters; the eggs showing the four\r\nextremes measure =28.2= by 22.0, 26.8 by =22.8=, and =26.2= by =20.7=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               COLAPTES CHRYSOIDES CHRYSOIDES (Malherbe)\r\n\r\n                          CAPE GILDED FLICKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nBecause Malherbe’s name was given to the first gilded flicker to be\r\ndescribed, and because his type came from the Cape region of Baja\r\nCalifornia, this race becomes the type race of the species. Its range\r\nextends from about latitude 28° N. to the southern extremity of Baja\r\nCalifornia. It is about the same size as its nearest relative to the\r\nnorthward, _brunnescens_, but is decidedly lighter in coloration. It is\r\nsmaller than _mearnsi_ and somewhat darker in coloration.\r\n\r\nWilliam Brewster (1902) says of its haunts: “Mr. Belding and Mr.\r\nFrazar agree as to the rarity of the Gilded Flicker on the higher\r\nmountains, where only a few individuals were seen by the former, and\r\nbut two (both females, taken on the Sierra de la Laguna, April 29)\r\nobtained by the latter. The bird’s true home is evidently at the bases\r\nof the mountains, and among the foothills extending thence to the\r\nshores of the Pacific on the south and west, and to the Gulf on the\r\neast. Throughout this region it is a common species, although not so\r\nnumerously represented as _Melanerpes uropygialis_. On the arid plains\r\nnear the coast it breeds in the stems of the giant cactus.”\r\n\r\nGriffing Bancroft (1930) says of this species in central Baja\r\nCalifornia, south of latitude 28°:\r\n\r\n     The birds are extremely wild, often flushing from a\r\n     distance of a quarter of a mile. They lay in old cavities\r\n     and, probably, also in those that are new; scarred sahuaro\r\n     dries so rapidly that a definite determination on this\r\n     point was not possible. The nests are usually twenty feet\r\n     or more above the ground and the cavities are generous; an\r\n     eight-inch diameter and a two-foot depth are not unusual.\r\n     Occasionally they will use natural openings in the cardón\r\n     or holes that have been chopped open by honey gatherers.\r\n\r\n     The flickers lay from early April until well into June.\r\n     The number of eggs in a clutch is normally three. With the\r\n     single exception of one set of five we found none larger,\r\n     and none smaller in which incubation had commenced.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the Cape gilded flicker are apparently similar to those\r\nof other flickers, except in size. Mr. Bancroft (1930) gives the\r\nmeasurements of 18 eggs as averaging 26.3 by 20.9 millimeters. The\r\nmeasurements of 8 other eggs average 28.49 by 21.15 millimeters;\r\nthe eggs, in this series, showing the four extremes measure =31.35=\r\nby 21.83, 30.15 by =22.22=, =25.90= by 20.70, and 26.70 by =20.00=\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\nIts habits in general are apparently similar to those the gilded\r\nflicker of Arizona, on which more has been published, and the reader is\r\nreferred to the following account of _Colaptes chrysoides mearnsi_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n_Range._--Southern Arizona, southeastern California, and northwestern\r\nMexico; nonmigratory.\r\n\r\nThe range of the gilded flicker extends =north= to extreme southeastern\r\nCalifornia (Duncan Flats); and southern Arizona (Antelope Peak,\r\nBigbug, and the Salt River Bird Reservation). =East= to southeastern\r\nArizona (Salt River Bird Reservation, Desert Wells, Picacho, Oracle,\r\nand Tombstone); central Sonora (Magdalena, Opodepe, Hermosillo,\r\nCedros, and Camoa); and central Sinaloa (Culiacan). =South= to Sinaloa\r\n(Culiacan); and southern Baja California (Cape San Lucas). =West= to\r\nBaja California (Cape San Lucas, Todos Santos, Triunfo, Santa Margarita\r\nIsland, San Javier, San Quintin, and the Alamo River); and southeastern\r\nCalifornia (Duncan Flats).\r\n\r\nThe range as outlined is for the entire species, which has been\r\nseparated into three geographic races. The typical race, known as the\r\nCape gilded flicker (_C. c. chrysoides_), is found in the Cape district\r\nof Baja California and north to about latitude 28° N. The San Fernando\r\nflicker (_C. c. brunnescens_) occurs only within a range of two degrees\r\nlatitude in Baja California (lat. 28° to 30° N.). Mearns’s gilded\r\nflicker (_C. c. mearnsi_) is the race found in the southwestern United\r\nStates, northwestern Baja California, and the mainland of Mexico.\r\n\r\n  _Egg dates._--Arizona: 24 records, April 1 to June 11; 12 records,\r\n    April 21 to May 20, indicating the height of the season.\r\n  Baja California: 16 records, April 6 to May 20; 8 records, April 10\r\n    to May 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  COLAPTES CHRYSOIDES MEARNSI Ridgway\r\n\r\n                        MEARNS’S GILDED FLICKER\r\n\r\n                               PLATE 39\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nMearns’s gilded flicker is the best known of the three races of this\r\nhandsome species. Its range is along our southwestern border in\r\nsouthwestern Arizona, extreme southeastern California, and in Sonora,\r\nMexico. It is confined almost entirely, especially in the breeding\r\nseason, to the giant cactus region in this area; its distribution seems\r\nto be mainly governed by the distribution of this cactus, on which it\r\nseems to depend for most of the necessities of life. M. French Gilman\r\n(1915) puts it very well, as follows: “The giant cactus is to this\r\nFlicker and the Gila Woodpecker, what the bamboo is to the inhabitants\r\nof some of the eastern islands. * * * The cactus furnishes the birds\r\nwith home, shelter, food and possibly drink. They roost in the holes\r\nand seek them as retreat from rain storms.” But he says that this\r\nflicker is also “found in cottonwood and willow groves as well as\r\nwherever the giant cactus grows.”\r\n\r\nW. E. D. Scott (1886) writes: “A rather common resident where-ever the\r\ngiant cactus occurs throughout the region, but is much more common in\r\nthe giant cactus of the southern part of the area under consideration\r\n[southern Arizona] than to the northward. They are common all about\r\nTucson in such localities as I have indicated, but are more rare in the\r\nSan Pedro Valley. I have met with the species in early spring and fall\r\non the San Pedro slope of the Catalinas as high up as 3,000 feet. I\r\nhave now and then seen single individuals in the mesquite timber, far\r\nfrom any giant cactus. All that I have ever met with breeding have been\r\nin giant cactus.”\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--We spent three days, May 21, 22, and 23, 1922, collecting\r\non the giant-cactus plains near Tucson, Ariz., between the mesquite\r\nforest to the southward and the Catalina Mountains to the eastward from\r\nTucson. Here we found Mearns’s gilded flicker very common; we climbed\r\nto and examined seven nests and probably passed by a number of others.\r\nThe nests were all in the giant cactus, at heights ranging from 12 to\r\n20 feet from the ground; the only cavity measured was about 24 inches\r\ndeep. We were rather too late for eggs of this species, as many of\r\nthe nests held large young, two in each nest examined, never more nor\r\nfewer. On May 22 we found a nest containing two fresh eggs and another\r\nnest with four addled eggs, probably deserted. At one of the first\r\nnests that I examined I was surprised, when I inserted my hand, to feel\r\nsomething cold and clammy; my hand was quickly withdrawn and the hole\r\nwas chopped out, revealing a large gopher snake that had killed and\r\nhalf swallowed, head first, one of the large young. At another nest,\r\ncontaining two large young, I shot the adult male for a specimen, after\r\nwhich I found the female dead in a nearby hole, which necessitated\r\ntaking the two young also. After I had left for home, my companion,\r\nFrank C. Willard, took a set of three fresh eggs on June 11, from a\r\nnest 14 feet up in a small giant cactus; this was probably a second\r\nlaying.\r\n\r\nMr. Gilman (1915), who has had considerable experience with this\r\nspecies, writes:\r\n\r\n     The nests are found in giant cactus, cottonwood and willow,\r\n     and in that order as to frequency, the giant cactus\r\n     leading. Nests are in the giant cactus or Saguaro as it\r\n     is called, far from water, and in cottonwood and willow\r\n     along the river, on banks of the canals, or even standing\r\n     in stagnant water pools. Of twenty-seven nests examined,\r\n     containing eggs or young, twenty-one were in the Saguaro,\r\n     four in willow, and two in cottonwood. Others were seen\r\n     in cottonwood but too difficult of access, and many in\r\n     the cactus were out of reach. If careful count were made\r\n     I believe about ninety per cent would be found in the\r\n     cactus. Nests in cottonwood and willow ranged from five\r\n     to twenty-five feet from the ground, and in Saguaros from\r\n     eleven to twenty-five or thirty feet. * * *\r\n\r\n     The entrance to the nest holes varies much, as may be seen\r\n     from the figures given. The smallest entrance measured 2¾\r\n     inches and the largest 4¾ inches. The shallowest hole was\r\n     ten inches, and the deepest eighteen inches. * * * The\r\n     entrance to the eighteen inch hole was three and one-half\r\n     inches in diameter, and while the ratio is not constant,\r\n     the shallower holes tend to have smaller entrances, and\r\n     the deeper holes have larger entrances. * * * From the few\r\n     measurements taken it may be stated that the bottom of\r\n     the nest hole is from four and one-half to six inches in\r\n     diameter. It is hardly correct to use the term diameter, as\r\n     many of the hole bottoms were not nearly circular, one I\r\n     measured being four inches one way and six the other. This\r\n     variation seemed to be governed by the size of the cactus,\r\n     as in the smaller plants there was not room to excavate a\r\n     large circular bottom, and it had to be stretched one way.\r\n\r\nIn the lower Colorado Valley, Dr. Joseph Grinnell (1914) found that\r\n“at least two pairs were nesting in dead cottonwood stumps in the\r\ndrowned-out area of the river bottom. A nesting hole located here was\r\neighteen feet above the ground, in a large stub.” He also mentions\r\nthe following nests found in the saguaro belt: “On the Arizona side,\r\nApril 22, excavation sixteen and one-half feet above ground in cactus\r\nthirty-one feet high, contained two fresh eggs; April 24, excavation\r\ntwenty feet above the ground, not investigated. On the California side,\r\nApril 23, excavation ten and one-third feet above the ground, in cactus\r\ntwenty-eight feet high, contained one infertile egg and two small\r\nyoung.”\r\n\r\nMajor Bendire (1895) writes:\r\n\r\n     It nests at varying distances from the ground from 8 to 40\r\n     feet, generally at heights of about 15 feet. I have the\r\n     indurated form of a nesting cavity of this species now\r\n     before me, showing its exact shape. The hardened walls\r\n     are about one-fourth of an inch thick, and show the inner\r\n     contour of the cavity perfectly. The entrance is nearly 3\r\n     inches in diameter; inside it is about 7 by 4 inches wide\r\n     and 5½ inches deep. The sides and bottom of the cavity\r\n     are quite smooth, considering the nature of the substance\r\n     (the soft inner pulp of the cactus) out of which it is\r\n     excavated. It occupied only one-half of the trunk of one\r\n     of these giant cacti, and the rear of the cavity did not\r\n     quite reach the center of the plant. The eggs lay on the\r\n     hardened floor, and not, as usual, on a layer of chips. I\r\n     am inclined to believe that a freshly excavated nesting\r\n     site is not habitable for some weeks, as it must require\r\n     some time for the exuding sap to harden. The mold before me\r\n     somewhat resembles a wasp’s nest, both in color and shape,\r\n     and if suspended from the limb of a tree might easily be\r\n     mistaken for one.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--As to the number of eggs laid by the gilded flicker, Mr.\r\nGilman (1915) writes: “Of the twenty-seven nests examined, eight had\r\nfive eggs, or young plus eggs, to make count of five for the set;\r\neleven had four eggs or young, or young plus eggs; six nests contained\r\nthree eggs or three young; and two nests had two young each. In no case\r\ndid I find five young in a nest, and from the fact that infertile eggs\r\nwere found with three and four young in a nest, it may be inferred that\r\nin many of the nests containing two, three or four young, more eggs had\r\nbeen laid. In no nest did I find more than five eggs, and I conclude\r\nthat the set is from three to five eggs.”\r\n\r\nThe gilded flicker evidently lays fewer eggs than its northern and\r\neastern relatives, and the surprising thing is that there are so many\r\ncases of infertile eggs, often one and sometimes two in a set. I have\r\nhad sets of six and seven eggs reported in collections, but these may\r\nhave been products of two females, where nesting holes were scarce or\r\nthe region overcrowded by the many birds that use these holes. The\r\nfew eggs that I have seen are like other flickers’ eggs but either\r\ndull white or only slightly glossy; this may not be the universal\r\nrule, however. The measurements of 50 eggs average 27.86 by 21.34\r\nmillimeters; the eggs showing the four extremes measure =32.0= by 22.0,\r\n27.78 by =22.22=, and =24.61= by =20.04= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Plumages._--Mr. Gilman (1915) says: “The young when first hatched are\r\nnot very prepossessing to any one, except perhaps the parents. At first\r\nglance they remind one of the pictured restoration of the Plesiosaurus,\r\nwith their long twisting naked necks. The lower mandible was more than\r\nan eighth of an inch longer than the upper, and on the tip of each was\r\nthe hard white growth used in opening the shell.”\r\n\r\nIn the juvenal plumage, which is acquired before the young bird leaves\r\nthe nest, the young male is similar to the adult male, but the forehead\r\nis usually tinged with dark red; the red malar patch is duller and less\r\nuniform; the upper parts are grayer, less brownish, and more heavily\r\nbarred; the primaries are tipped with brownish white; the under parts\r\nare grayish white, more profusely, but less distinctly, spotted; the\r\nblack patch on the breast is smaller and more central; the yellow in\r\nthe wings and tail is duller; the black tips on the under side of the\r\ntail are duller and not so well defined; and the bill is much smaller\r\nand weaker. The young female is similar to the young male, but there\r\nis no red in the crown or in the malar patches, the latter being pale\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nI have not seen enough material, taken at the proper seasons, to work\r\nout the molts, but these are probably the same as in other flickers.\r\n\r\nSeveral apparent hybrids with _cafer_ have been reported. Dr. Grinnell\r\n(1914), who has made a study of this subject, seems to doubt if there\r\nis any hybridizing between these species; he writes:\r\n\r\n     The salient fact shown by this comparative examination\r\n     is that in _all other characters_ the specimens aberrant\r\n     in colors of wing and tail, are perfectly typical of\r\n     _chrysoides_ (that is, of its subspecies _mearnsi_). None\r\n     of the phenomena consequent upon hybridization is evidenced\r\n     in other particulars, such as general size, proportional\r\n     dimensions, extent of dorsal barring, colors of body and\r\n     head. In all these characters there is no nearer approach\r\n     of the red-shafted _chrysoides_ to _collaris_, than of the\r\n     yellow-shafted _chrysoides_.\r\n\r\n     My conclusion is that the strain of _chrysoides_ occurring\r\n     at the present time in the lower Colorado Valley shows\r\n     proneness to replacement of yellow by red, without there\r\n     having been any interbreeding with another species. This\r\n     may be accounted for chemico-physiologically, as in the\r\n     case of the linnet of the Hawaiian Islands, where, however,\r\n     the change has been from red to yellow.\r\n\r\n     * * * It is quite evident that the aberrant examples\r\n     described by Brewster and Swarth from central Arizona, as\r\n     referred to above, are of the same nature as the Colorado\r\n     Valley specimens. The chances are that they were not\r\n     hybrids. So far as shown by the literature at hand, no\r\n     unquestioned hybrids have been found between _chrysoides_\r\n     (or any of its subspecies) and _collaris_ or _cafer_.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The food of Mearns’s gilded flicker seems to be much like\r\nthat of the other flickers, including ants and various other insects\r\nand such wild fruits and berries as are available in its territory.\r\nDr. Grinnell (1914) reports that the stomachs of two birds, taken in\r\nthe Colorado Valley, “had their gullets distended with a mass of small\r\nblack ants and ant larvae.” Mr. Gilman (1915) says:\r\n\r\n     They resort regularly to the Indian corncribs and are seen\r\n     in corn fields though I have never noticed them actually\r\n     engaged on an ear of green corn as I have the Gilas. They\r\n     probably attack the green corn but are quiet about the work\r\n     instead of advertising their presence. They eat largely of\r\n     the cactus fruit and possibly of the pulp at certain lean\r\n     seasons. They are very fond of watermelon, and eat freely\r\n     of it when it is placed on bird tables or on the ground\r\n     in shade of tree or shed. They appear to feed frequently\r\n     on the ground in the way the red-shafted does, and are\r\n     probably after ants most of the time. I have seen them at\r\n     work on an ant hill and even pecking into the ground after\r\n     the insects.\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The same writer says on this subject:\r\n\r\n     The Gilded Flickers are much quieter than the Gilas, and\r\n     are not so much in evidence around homes, though they do\r\n     not appear to be very timid. They are simply less sociable\r\n     I presume. * * *\r\n\r\n     They are peaceable and impress me as being eminently\r\n     practical and matter of fact. Each one minds his own\r\n     business and seems willing to live and let live. They do\r\n     not assemble in numbers as the Gilas do sometimes, but are\r\n     solitary or in pairs. They have the same habit of pecking\r\n     the walls of buildings as have the red-shafted flickers,\r\n     and one has worked spasmodically at the shingled gable of\r\n     the school house here for the past three years. I take it\r\n     to be the same individual, for he is rather tame and roosts\r\n     each night above one of the window casings. * * *\r\n\r\n     They are not close sitters, and usually leave the nest\r\n     before the tree is reached or the ladder placed against the\r\n     trunk. As soon as an intruder’s footsteps become audible\r\n     the landlady pokes her head from the entrance, and soon\r\n     after departs, never giving opportunity for capturing her\r\n     on the nest.\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The gilded flicker apparently possesses as good a vocabulary\r\nas any other flicker, uttering practically all the varied notes common\r\nto the genus, but evidently it is not quite so noisy as its relatives.\r\nMr. Gilman (1915) thinks that its notes are “not so frequent nor quite\r\nso loud” as those of the red-shafted flicker.\r\n\r\n_Field marks._--The gilded flicker can be recognized easily as a\r\nflicker by the characteristic markings of the genus, by its flight\r\nand by its voice. It looks like an eastern flicker with a red malar\r\npatch (in the male) instead of a black one, and with no red crescent\r\non the nape in either sex. It looks like a pale red-shafted flicker\r\nwith yellow, instead of red, in the wings and tail. Its smaller size is\r\nhardly noticeable in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                COLAPTES CHRYSOIDES BRUNNESCENS Anthony\r\n\r\n                         SAN FERNANDO FLICKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThe gilded flicker of middle Baja California, between latitude 28° and\r\nlatitude 30° N., is a well-marked subspecies. A. W. Anthony (1895b),\r\nnaming it, characterized it as “differing from _C. chrysoides_ in\r\ndarker upper parts and slightly smaller size.” He says further: “It\r\nwould be quite natural to expect specimens of _Colaptes_ from the\r\nnorthern half of Lower California to be more or less intermediate\r\nbetween those of Arizona and Cape St. Lucas. They are, however, further\r\nremoved from the type form from the Cape than are those from Arizona\r\nand northern Mexico, and in the series I have examined the Arizona\r\nskins are exactly intermediate in the color of the upper parts between\r\na series from Cape St. Lucas and my skins from San Fernando.”\r\n\r\nRidgway (1914) describes _brunnescens_ as “similar to _C. c.\r\nchrysoides_, but coloration decidedly darker and browner, color of\r\npileum more rufescent (russet, or between russet and mars brown, in\r\ntypical specimens), immaculate area of rump more restricted (sometimes\r\nwhole rump spotted with black), wing and tail averaging shorter, and\r\nbill longer.”\r\n\r\nMr. Anthony wrote to Major Bendire (1895): “The Gilded Flicker is\r\nrather common in the heavy growth of giant cactus, _Cereus pringlei_,\r\nbut not adverse to the candlewood forests which cover a large part of\r\nthe peninsula between latitudes 28° and 30°.” The general habits of\r\nthis flicker do not seem to differ from those of the species elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the San Fernando flicker are similar to those of the\r\npreceeding subspecies. Griffing Bancroft (1930) gives the average\r\nmeasurements of 24 eggs as 27.1 by 21.3 millimeters. I have the\r\nmeasurements of 5 others, which average 28.9 by 22.1 millimeters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   COLAPTES CAFER RUFIPILEUS Ridgway\r\n\r\n                           GUADALUPE FLICKER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HABITS\r\n\r\nThis insular race of the red-shafted flickers is another member of\r\nthe unique avifauna of that interesting island that has followed the\r\nGuadalupe caracara, and other species peculiar to Guadalupe Island,\r\ninto extinction. It was discovered by Dr. Edward Palmer in 1875 and was\r\ndescribed and named by Robert Ridgway (1876) as _Colaptes mexicanus\r\nrufipileus_. In his description of it, he remarks: “In the closed tail,\r\nonly about half an inch of red is exposed on the under surface beyond\r\nthe lower coverts, the remaining 2.50 being uniform black. The main\r\ndifferences from the continental form consist in the longer bill, more\r\npinkish rump, and bright tawny forehead. In the latter feature, the\r\nresemblance is closer to _C. chrysoides_, the crown and nape having\r\nabout the same gradation from bright cinnamon-tawny anteriorly to dull\r\ngrayish-cinnamon posteriorly.” Although it has a decidedly longer bill\r\nthan the mainland forms, it has a much shorter wing and tail. The\r\ncollector’s notes state that, even then, it was “rare, and apparently\r\nonly found in the pine-woods of the north end of the island.”\r\n\r\nWalter E. Bryant (1887), who visited Guadalupe in 1885 and 1886, gives\r\nus the best account we have of this little-known bird. He says of its\r\nstatus and haunts at that time: “Comparatively speaking, this bird\r\nwas not rare in the restricted area of the large cypress grove, but\r\napart from this locality less than a dozen were seen. Three specimens\r\nwere taken among some palms within a short distance from the beach on\r\nthe eastern side of the island. One only was heard among the pines at\r\nthe northern portion, and in the vicinity of the large palm grove on\r\nthe northwestern slope they were occasionally seen.” He collected ten\r\nspecimens, whereas Dr. Palmer took only three.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1906, W. W. Brown, Jr., with two assistants, collected\r\nfor two months on the island for the Thayer Museum, of which Thayer\r\nand Bangs (1908) say: “This well-marked island form is in all\r\nprobability doomed to speedy extinction, and will be the next of the\r\nGuadalupe birds to go. Brown and Marsden found in all not more than\r\nforty individuals in the island. In the small cypress grove near the\r\ncabins there were four and in the large cypress woods about thirty-five.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Brown tells us that in the breeding season, at least, the species\r\nis wholly confined to the cypresses, none being seen in the pine woods.\r\nThe bird is very tame and unsuspicious and falls an easy prey to the\r\ncats.”\r\n\r\n_Courtship._--Mr. Bryant (1887) noted Guadalupe flickers in courtship\r\nantics in January and in February. According to his description of\r\ntheir actions and their notes at such times, these performances are\r\nevidently similar to those of other flickers elsewhere.\r\n\r\n_Nesting._--Apparently Dr. Palmer found no nests and collected no\r\neggs of this flicker, but Mr. Bryant (1887) has this to say about its\r\nnesting habits:\r\n\r\n     By March 16, the birds were invariably found in pairs,\r\n     and my wish to secure a setting of eggs before departing\r\n     seemed in a fair way of being fulfilled. Strolling among\r\n     the cypresses on the 27th of March, I found four trees upon\r\n     which the birds were at work or had been recently, and in\r\n     such cases the birds themselves were always to be found in\r\n     the immediate vicinity. Passing a half-dead tree I heard\r\n     the sounding taps of a woodpecker at work, and as I neared\r\n     the spot, the slight noise which I made as I carefully\r\n     picked my way over the rock-strewn ground caused a handsome\r\n     male bird to suddenly appear at an opening about four feet\r\n     high. With a foot grasping either side of the entrance he\r\n     gazed upon the intruder. Having comprehended the situation,\r\n     he flew to another tree, where he quietly awaited my\r\n     inspection and departure. The hole was then down about\r\n     fifteen inches. By April 7, it had reached a depth of about\r\n     twenty inches and contained six fresh eggs, upon which the\r\n     female was then sitting.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown collected, for the Thayer Museum, six sets of eggs, one set\r\nof five, two sets of four, one set of three, and two single eggs, all\r\nof which are now in the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge,\r\nMass. The eggs were collected on dates ranging from May 8 to June 8,\r\n1906; the nests were all in cypresses, mostly old or dead trees or\r\nstumps, at heights ranging from 4 to 20 feet above the ground, and\r\nat altitudes of from 3,700 to 4,500 feet above sea level; one of the\r\ncavities was only 2 inches deep, but some of the others were 18 or 20\r\ninches deep and from 3½ to 4 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--The number of eggs laid by the Guadalupe flicker apparently\r\nranged from four to six. The eggs that I have seen, in Cambridge, are\r\novate, pure white, and decidedly glossy, like other flickers’ eggs.\r\nThe measurements of 23 eggs average 27.8 by 21.7 millimeters; the eggs\r\nshowing the four extremes measure =30.2= by 21.1, 28.0 by =22.5=, and\r\n=26.8= by =20.5= millimeters.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Mr. Bryant (1887) says: “The food of this species during a\r\nportion of the year consists largely of smooth-skinned caterpillars,\r\nbesides numerous beetles and ants; the latter are always obtainable and\r\ngrowing to a large size figure as an important item of their diet.”\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--He also remarks: “Of all the species of this family I\r\nhave ever met with, none have been so tame and unsuspicious or less\r\nfrightened by the report of a gun.”\r\n\r\n_Voice._--The notes of the Guadalupe flicker are also similar to those\r\nof the mainland forms, for Mr. Bryant (1887) says: “In addition to\r\nthe familiar scythe-whetting notes they have the peculiar ‘wake-up’\r\ncall and its rapid prelude of monosyllables. By imitating this call I\r\ndecoyed a distant female to within short range, the bird coming through\r\nthe thickest of the cypress grove, stopping at short intervals to call\r\nand listen for a reply.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LITERATURE CITED\r\n\r\n\r\n  ACHILLES, LAURENCE.\r\n       1906.

Bent was one\r\nof America’s greatest ornithologists. His historic studies, published\r\noriginally under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, are now\r\nall being reprinted by Dover Publications. These works rank as classics\r\nof our time. No ornithologist, conservationist, amateur naturalist or\r\nbirdwatcher should be without them.\r\n\r\nIn this volume the reader will find an encyclopedic collection of\r\ninformation about 64 kinds of woodpecker (hairy, downy, pileated,\r\nred-headed, cactus, Nuttall’s, white-headed, three-toed, etc.),\r\nsapsucker, and flicker. Not a group of generalized descriptions, but a\r\ncompilation of detailed, specific observations of individual birds and\r\nflocks throughout the country, it describes in readable language and\r\ncopious detail the nesting habits, eggs, young, plumage, food, range,\r\nbehavior, field marks, voice, enemies, winter habits, distribution,\r\ncourtship procedures, molting information, migratory habits--whatever\r\nyou want to know about these birds.\r\n\r\nCompletely modern in approach, the study was made with the full\r\nrecognition of the difficulties inherent in the observation and\r\ninterpretation of wild life behavior. For that reason, the author\r\nutilized not only the reports of hundreds of contemporary observers all\r\nover the country, but also the writings of America’s great naturalists\r\nof the past--Audubon, Burroughs, William Brewster. The complete textual\r\ncoverage is supplemented by 39 full-page black-and-white plates,\r\ncontaining 74 photographs of adults and young, nesting sites, the\r\nfeeding of nestlings, eggs, woodpecker damage to trees, and the like.\r\n\r\nUnabridged republication of 1st edition.
