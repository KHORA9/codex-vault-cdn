RECORD, M.A., M.F. ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF FOREST\r\nPRODUCTS, YALE UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST EDITION FIRST THOUSAND\r\n\r\n1914\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE SAME AUTHOR\r\n\r\nIdentification of the Economic Woods of the United States.\r\n8vo, vi + 117 pages, 15 figures. Cloth, $1.25 net.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE STAFF OF THE FOREST PRODUCTS LABORATORY, AT MADISON,\r\nWISCONSIN IN APPRECIATION OF THE MANY OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED AND\r\nCOURTESIES EXTENDED THE AUTHOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book was written primarily for students of forestry to whom\r\na knowledge of the technical properties of wood is essential.\r\nThe mechanics involved is reduced to the simplest terms and\r\nwithout reference to higher mathematics, with which the students\r\nrarely are familiar. The intention throughout has been to avoid\r\nall unnecessarily technical language and descriptions, thereby\r\nmaking the subject-matter readily available to every one\r\ninterested in wood.\r\n\r\nPart I is devoted to a discussion of the mechanical properties\r\nof wood--the relation of wood material to stresses and strains.\r\nMuch of the subject-matter is merely elementary mechanics of\r\nmaterials in general, though written with reference to wood in\r\nparticular. Numerous tables are included, showing the various\r\nstrength values of many of the more important American woods.\r\n\r\nPart II deals with the factors affecting the mechanical\r\nproperties of wood. This is a subject of interest to all who are\r\nconcerned in the rational use of wood, and to the forester it\r\nalso, by retrospection, suggests ways and means of regulating\r\nhis forest product through control of the conditions of\r\nproduction. Attempt has been made, in the light of all data at\r\nhand, to answer many moot questions, such as the effect on the\r\nquality of wood of rate of growth, season of cutting, heartwood\r\nand sapwood, locality of growth, weight, water content,\r\nsteaming, and defects.\r\n\r\nPart III describes methods of timber testing. They are for the\r\nmost part those followed by the U.S. Forest Service. In schools\r\nequipped with the necessary machinery the instructions will\r\nserve to direct the tests; in others a study of the text with\r\nreference to the illustrations should give an adequate\r\nconception of the methods employed in this most important line\r\nof research.\r\n\r\nThe appendix contains a copy of the working plan followed by the\r\nU.S. Forest Service in the extensive investigations covering the\r\nmechanical properties of the woods grown in the United States.\r\nIt contains many valuable suggestions for the independent\r\ninvestigator. In addition four tables of strength values for\r\nstructural timbers, both green and air-seasoned, are included.\r\nThe relation of the stresses developed in different structural\r\nforms to those developed in the small clear specimens is given.\r\n\r\nIn the bibliography attempt was made to list all of the\r\nimportant publications and articles on the mechanical properties\r\nof wood, and timber testing. While admittedly incomplete, it\r\nshould prove of assistance to the student who desires a fuller\r\nknowledge of the subject than is presented here.\r\n\r\nThe writer is indebted to the U.S. Forest Service for nearly all\r\nof his tables and photographs as well as many of the data upon\r\nwhich the book is based, since only the Government is able to\r\nconduct the extensive investigations essential to a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the subject. More than eighty thousand tests\r\nhave been made at the Madison laboratory alone, and the work is\r\nfar from completion.\r\n\r\nThe writer also acknowledges his indebtedness to Mr. Emanuel\r\nFritz, M.E., M.F., for many helpful suggestions in the\r\npreparation of Part I; and especially to Mr. Harry Donald\r\nTiemann, M.E., M.F., engineer in charge of Timber Physics at the\r\nGovernment Forest Products Laboratory, Madison, Wisconsin, for\r\ncareful revision of the entire manuscript.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL J.

By external force is meant\r\nany force outside of a given piece of material which tends to\r\ndeform it in any manner. It is largely such properties that\r\ndetermine the use of wood for structural and building purposes\r\nand innumerable other uses of which furniture, vehicles,\r\nimplements, and tool handles are a few common examples.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of these properties is obtained through\r\nexperimentation either in the employment of the wood in practice\r\nor by means of special testing apparatus in the laboratory.\r\nOwing to the wide range of variation in wood it is necessary\r\nthat a great number of tests be made and that so far as possible\r\nall disturbing factors be eliminated. For comparison of\r\ndifferent kinds or sizes a standard method of testing is\r\nnecessary and the values must be expressed in some defined\r\nunits. For these reasons laboratory experiments if properly\r\nconducted have many advantages over any other method.\r\n\r\nOne object of such investigation is to find unit values for\r\nstrength and stiffness, etc. These, because of the complex\r\nstructure of wood, cannot have a constant value which will be\r\nexactly repeated in each test, even though no error be made. The\r\nmost that can be accomplished is to find average values, the\r\namount of variation above and below, and the laws which govern\r\nthe variation. On account of the great variability in strength\r\nof different specimens of wood even from the same stick and\r\nappearing to be alike, it is important to eliminate as far as\r\npossible all extraneous factors liable to influence the results\r\nof the tests.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical properties of wood considered in this book are:\r\n(1) stiffness and elasticity, (2) tensile strength, (3)\r\ncompressive or crushing strength, (4) shearing strength, (5)\r\ntransverse or bending strength, (6) toughness, (7) hardness, (8)\r\ncleavability, (9) resilience. In connection with these,\r\nassociated properties of importance are briefly treated.\r\n\r\nIn making use of figures indicating the strength or other\r\nmechanical properties of wood for the purpose of comparing the\r\nrelative merits of different species, the fact should be borne\r\nin mind that there is a considerable range in variability of\r\neach individual material and that small differences, such as a\r\nfew hundred pounds in values of 10,000 pounds, cannot be\r\nconsidered as a criterion of the quality of the timber. In\r\ntesting material of the same kind and grade, differences of 25\r\nper cent between individual specimens may be expected in\r\nconifers and 50 per cent or even more in hardwoods. The figures\r\ngiven in the tables should be taken as indications rather than\r\nfixed values, and as applicable to a large number collectively\r\nand not to individual pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNDAMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nStudy of the mechanical properties of a material is concerned\r\nmostly with its behavior in relation to stresses and strains,\r\nand the factors affecting this behavior. A ~stress~ is a\r\ndistributed force and may be defined as the mutual action (1) of\r\none body upon another, or (2) of one part of a body upon another\r\npart. In the first case the stress is _external_; in the other\r\n_internal_. The same stress may be internal from one point of\r\nview and external from another. An external force is always\r\nbalanced by the internal stresses when the body is in\r\nequilibrium.\r\n\r\nIf no external forces act upon a body its particles assume\r\ncertain relative positions, and it has what is called its\r\n_natural shape and size_. If sufficient external force is\r\napplied the natural shape and size will be changed. This\r\ndistortion or deformation of the material is known as the\r\n~strain~. Every stress produces a corresponding strain, and\r\nwithin a certain limit (see _elastic limit_, in FUNDAMENTAL\r\nCONSIDERATIONS AND DEFINITIONS, above) the strain is directly\r\nproportional to the stress producing it.[1] The same intensity\r\nof stress, however, does not produce the same strain in\r\ndifferent materials or in different qualities of the same\r\nmaterial. No strain would be produced in a perfectly rigid body,\r\nbut such is not known to exist.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is in accordance with the discovery made in\r\n1678 by Robert Hooke, and is known as _Hooke's law_.]\r\n\r\nStress is measured in pounds (or other unit of weight or force).\r\nA ~unit stress~ is the stress on a unit of the sectional\r\n      {                P  }\r\narea. { Unit stress = --- } For instance, if a load (P) of one\r\n      {                A  }\r\nhundred pounds is uniformly supported by a vertical post with a\r\ncross-sectional area (A) of ten square inches, the unit\r\ncompressive stress is ten pounds per square inch.\r\n\r\nStrain is measured in inches (or other linear unit). A ~unit\r\nstrain~ is the strain per unit of length. Thus if a post 10\r\ninches long before compression is 9.9 inches long under the\r\ncompressive stress, the total strain is 0.1 inch, and the unit\r\n           l     0.1\r\nstrain is --- = ----- = 0.01 inch per inch of length.\r\n           L     10\r\n\r\nAs the stress increases there is a corresponding increase in the\r\nstrain. This ratio may be graphically shown by means of a\r\ndiagram or curve plotted with the increments of load or stress\r\nas ordinates and the increments of strain as abscissæ. This is\r\nknown as the ~stress-strain diagram~. Within the limit mentioned\r\nabove the diagram is a straight line. (See Fig. 1.) If the\r\nresults of similar experiments on different specimens are\r\nplotted to the same scales, the diagrams furnish a ready means\r\nfor comparison. The greater the resistance a material offers to\r\ndeformation the steeper or nearer the vertical axis will be the\r\nline.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Stress-strain diagrams of two longleaf\r\npine beams. E.L. = elastic limit. The areas of the triangles\r\n0(EL)A and 0(EL)B represent the elastic resilience of the dry\r\nand green beams, respectively.]\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of internal stresses, namely, (1)\r\n~tensile~, (2) ~compressive~, and (3) ~shearing~. When external\r\nforces act upon a bar in a direction away from its ends or a\r\ndirect pull, the stress is a tensile stress; when toward the\r\nends or a direct push, compressive stress. In the first instance\r\nthe strain is an _elongation_; in the second a _shortening_.\r\nWhenever the forces tend to cause one portion of the material to\r\nslide upon another adjacent to it the action is called a\r\n_shear_. The action is that of an ordinary pair of shears. When\r\nriveted plates slide on each other the rivets are sheared off.\r\n\r\nThese three simple stresses may act together, producing compound\r\nstresses, as in flexure. When a bow is bent there is a\r\ncompression of the fibres on the inner or concave side and an\r\nelongation of the fibres on the outer or convex side. There is\r\nalso a tendency of the various fibres to slide past one another\r\nin a longitudinal direction. If the bow were made of two or more\r\nseparate pieces of equal length it would be noted on bending\r\nthat slipping occurred along the surfaces of contact, and that\r\nthe ends would no longer be even. If these pieces were securely\r\nglued together they would no longer slip, but the tendency to do\r\nso would exist just the same. Moreover, it would be found in the\r\nlatter case that the bow would be much harder to bend than where\r\nthe pieces were not glued together--in other words, the\r\n_stiffness_ of the bow would be materially increased.\r\n\r\n~Stiffness~ is the property by means of which a body acted upon\r\nby external forces tends to retain its natural size and shape,\r\nor resists deformation. Thus a material that is difficult to\r\nbend or otherwise deform is stiff; one that is easily bent or\r\notherwise deformed is _flexible_. Flexibility is not the exact\r\ncounterpart of stiffness, as it also involves toughness and\r\npliability.\r\n\r\nIf successively larger loads are applied to a body and then\r\nremoved it will be found that at first the body completely\r\nregains its original form upon release from the stress--in other\r\nwords, the body is ~elastic~. No substance known is perfectly\r\nelastic, though many are practically so under small loads.\r\nEventually a point will be reached where the recovery of the\r\nspecimen is incomplete. This point is known as the ~elastic\r\nlimit~, which may be defined as the limit beyond which it is\r\nimpossible to carry the distortion of a body without producing a\r\npermanent alteration in shape. After this limit has been\r\nexceeded, the size and shape of the specimen after removal of\r\nthe load will not be the same as before, and the difference or\r\namount of change is known as the ~permanent set~.\r\n\r\nElastic limit as measured in tests and used in design may be\r\ndefined as that unit stress at which the deformation begins to\r\nincrease in a faster ratio than the applied load. In practice\r\nthe elastic limit of a material under test is determined from\r\nthe stress-strain diagram. It is that point in the line where\r\nthe diagram begins perceptibly to curve.[2] (See Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: If the straight portion does not pass through the\r\norigin, a parallel line should be drawn through the origin, and\r\nthe load at elastic limit taken from this line. (See Fig. 32.)]\r\n\r\n~Resilience~ is the amount of work done upon a body in deforming\r\nit. Within the elastic limit it is also a measure of the\r\npotential energy stored in the material and represents the\r\namount of work the material would do upon being released from a\r\nstate of stress. This may be graphically represented by a\r\ndiagram in which the abscissæ represent the amount of deflection\r\nand the ordinates the force acting. The area included between\r\nthe stress-strain curve and the initial line (which is zero)\r\nrepresents the work done. (See Fig. 1.) If the unit of space is\r\nin inches and the unit of force is in pounds the result is\r\ninch-pounds. If the elastic limit is taken as the apex of the\r\ntriangle the area of the triangle will represent the ~elastic\r\nresilience~ of the specimen. This amount of work can be applied\r\nrepeatedly and is perhaps the best measure of the toughness of\r\nthe wood as a working quality, though it is not synonymous with\r\ntoughness.\r\n\r\nPermanent set is due to the ~plasticity~ of the material. A\r\nperfectly plastic substance would have no elasticity and the\r\nsmallest forces would cause a set. Lead and moist clay are\r\nnearly plastic and wood possesses this property to a greater or\r\nless extent. The plasticity of wood is increased by wetting,\r\nheating, and especially by steaming and boiling. Were it not for\r\nthis property it would be impossible to dry wood without\r\ndestroying completely its cohesion, due to the irregularity of\r\nshrinkage.\r\n\r\nA substance that can undergo little change in shape without\r\nbreaking or rupturing is ~brittle~. Chalk and glass are common\r\nexamples of brittle materials. Sometimes the word _brash_ is\r\nused to describe this condition in wood. A brittle wood breaks\r\nsuddenly with a clean instead of a splintery fracture and\r\nwithout warning. Such woods are unfitted to resist shock or\r\nsudden application of load.\r\n\r\nThe measure of the stiffness of wood is termed the ~modulus of\r\nelasticity~ (or _coefficient of elasticity_). It is the ratio of\r\nstress per unit of area to the deformation per unit of\r\n        {      unit stress  }\r\nlength. { E = ------------- } It is a number indicative of\r\n        {      unit strain  }\r\nstiffness, not of strength, and only applies to conditions\r\nwithin the elastic limit. It is nearly the same whether derived\r\nfrom compression tests or from tension tests.\r\n\r\nA large modulus indicates a stiff material. Thus in green wood\r\ntested in static bending it varies from 643,000 pounds per\r\nsquare inch for arborvitæ to 1,662,000 pounds for longleaf pine,\r\nand 1,769,000 pounds for pignut hickory. (See Table IX.) The\r\nvalues derived from tests of small beams of dry material are\r\nmuch greater, approaching 3,000,000 for some of our woods. These\r\nvalues are small when compared with steel which has a modulus of\r\nelasticity of about 30,000,000 pounds per square inch.

This external pull is communicated to the\r\ninterior, so that any portion of the material exerts a pull or\r\ntensile force upon the remainder, the ability to do so depending\r\nupon the property of cohesion. The result is an elongation or\r\nstretching of the material in the direction of the applied\r\nforce. The action is the opposite of compression.\r\n\r\nWood exhibits its greatest strength in tension parallel to the\r\ngrain, and it is very uncommon in practice for a specimen to be\r\npulled in two lengthwise. This is due to the difficulty of\r\nmaking the end fastenings secure enough for the full tensile\r\nstrength to be brought into play before the fastenings shear off\r\nlongitudinally. This is not the case with metals, and as a\r\nresult they are used in almost all places where tensile strength\r\nis particularly needed, even though the remainder of the\r\nstructure, such as sills, beams, joists, posts, and flooring,\r\nmay be of wood. Thus in a wooden truss bridge the tension\r\nmembers are steel rods.\r\n\r\nThe tensile strength of wood parallel to the grain depends upon\r\nthe strength of the fibres and is affected not only by the\r\nnature and dimensions of the wood elements but also by their\r\narrangement. It is greatest in straight-grained specimens with\r\nthick-walled fibres. Cross grain of any kind materially reduces\r\nthe tensile strength of wood, since the tensile strength at\r\nright angles to the grain is only a small fraction of that\r\nparallel to the grain.\r\n\r\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                           TABLE II                           |\r\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|   RATIO OF STRENGTH OF WOOD IN TENSION AND IN COMPRESSION    |\r\n|           (Bul. 10, U.

The tension\r\nportion of the fracture is nearly the same as though the piece\r\nwere pulled in two lengthwise. The fibre walls are torn across\r\nobliquely and usually in a spiral direction. There is\r\npractically no pulling apart of the fibres, that is, no\r\nseparation of the fibres along their walls, regardless of their\r\nthickness. The nature of tension failure is apparently not\r\naffected by the moisture condition of the specimen, at least not\r\nso much so as the other strength values.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See Brush, Warren D.: A microscopic study of the\r\nmechanical failure of wood. Vol. II, Rev. F.S. Investigations,\r\nWashington, D.C., 1912, p. 35.]\r\n\r\nTension at right angles to the grain is closely related to\r\ncleavability. When wood fails in this manner the thin fibre\r\nwalls are torn in two lengthwise while the thick-walled fibres\r\nare usually pulled apart along the primary wall.\r\n\r\n|--------------------------------------------|\r\n|                 TABLE III                  |\r\n|--------------------------------------------|\r\n|  TENSILE STRENGTH AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE   |\r\n| GRAIN OF SMALL CLEAR PIECES OF 25 WOODS IN |\r\n|              GREEN CONDITION               |\r\n|         (Forest Service Cir. 213)          |\r\n|--------------------------------------------|\r\n|                  |    When    |    When    |\r\n|   COMMON NAME    | surface of | surface of |\r\n|   OF SPECIES     | failure is | failure is |\r\n|                  |   radial   | tangential |\r\n|------------------+------------+------------|\r\n|                  |  Lbs. per  |  Lbs. per  |\r\n|                  |  sq. inch  |  sq. inch  |\r\n|                  |            |            |\r\n|    Hardwoods     |            |            |\r\n|                  |            |            |\r\n| Ash, white       |      645   |      671   |\r\n| Basswood         |      226   |      303   |\r\n| Beech            |      633   |      969   |\r\n| Birch, yellow    |      446   |      526   |\r\n| Elm, slippery    |      765   |      832   |\r\n| Hackberry        |      661   |      786   |\r\n| Locust, honey    |    1,133   |    1,445   |\r\n| Maple, sugar     |      610   |      864   |\r\n| Oak, post        |      714   |      924   |\r\n|   red            |      639   |      874   |\r\n|   swamp white    |      757   |      909   |\r\n|   white          |      622   |      749   |\r\n|   yellow         |      728   |      929   |\r\n| Sycamore         |      540   |      781   |\r\n| Tupelo           |      472   |      796   |\r\n|                  |            |            |\r\n|    Conifers      |            |            |\r\n|                  |            |            |\r\n| Arborvitæ        |      241   |      235   |\r\n| Cypress, bald    |      242   |      251   |\r\n| Fir, white       |      213   |      304   |\r\n| Hemlock          |      271   |      323   |\r\n| Pine, longleaf   |      240   |      298   |\r\n|   red            |      179   |      205   |\r\n|   sugar          |      239   |      304   |\r\n|   western yellow |      230   |      252   |\r\n|   white          |      225   |      285   |\r\n| Tamarack         |      236   |      274   |\r\n|--------------------------------------------|\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPRESSIVE OR CRUSHING STRENGTH\r\n\r\n\r\n~Compression across the grain~ is very closely related to\r\nhardness and transverse shear. There are two ways in which wood\r\nis subjected to stress of this kind, namely, (1) with the load\r\nacting over the entire area of the specimen, and (2) with a load\r\nconcentrated over a portion of the area. (See Fig. 2.) The\r\nlatter is the condition more commonly met with in practice, as,\r\nfor example, where a post rests on a horizontal sill, or a rail\r\nrests on a cross-tie. The former condition, however, gives the\r\ntrue resistance of the grain to simple crushing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Compression across the grain.]\r\n\r\nThe first effect of compression across the grain is to compact\r\nthe fibres, the load gradually but irregularly increasing as the\r\ndensity of the material is increased. If the specimen lies on a\r\nflat surface and the load is applied to only a portion of the\r\nupper area, the bearing plate indents the wood, crushing the\r\nupper fibres without affecting the lower part. (See Fig. 3.) As\r\nthe load increases the projecting ends sometimes split\r\nhorizontally. (See Fig. 4.) The irregularities in the load are\r\ndue to the fact that the fibres collapse a few at a time,\r\nbeginning with those with the thinnest walls. The projection of\r\nthe ends increases the strength of the material directly beneath\r\nthe compressing weight by introducing a beam action which helps\r\nsupport the load. This influence is exerted for a short distance\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Side view of failures in compression\r\nacross the grain, showing crushing of blocks under bearing\r\nplate. Specimen at right shows splitting at ends.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--End view of failures in compression\r\nacross the grain, showing splitting of the ends of the test\r\nspecimens.]\r\n\r\nWhen wood is used for columns, props, posts, and spokes, the\r\nweight of the load tends to shorten the material endwise. This\r\nis ~endwise compression~, or compression parallel to the grain.\r\nIn the case of long columns, that is, pieces in which the length\r\nis very great compared with their diameter, the failure is by\r\nsidewise bending or flexure, instead of by crushing or\r\nsplitting. (See Fig. 5.) A familiar instance of this action is\r\nafforded by a flexible walking-stick. If downward pressure is\r\nexerted with the hand on the upper end of the stick placed\r\nvertically on the floor, it will be noted that a definite amount\r\nof force must be applied in each instance before decided flexure\r\ntakes place. After this point is reached a very slight increase\r\nof pressure very largely increases the deflection, thus\r\nobtaining so great a leverage about the middle section as to\r\ncause rupture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Testing a buggy spoke in endwise\r\ncompression, illustrating the failure by sidewise bending of a\r\nlong column fixed only at the lower end. _Photo by U. S. Forest\r\nService_]\r\n\r\nThe lateral bending of a column produces a combination of\r\nbending with compressive stress over the section, the\r\ncompressive stress being maximum at the section of greatest\r\ndeflection on the concave side. The convex surface is under\r\ntension, as in an ordinary beam test. (See Fig. 6.) If the same\r\nstick is braced in such a way that flexure is prevented, its\r\nsupporting strength is increased enormously, since the\r\ncompressive stress acts uniformly over the section, and failure\r\nis by crushing or splitting, as in small blocks. In all columns\r\nfree to bend in any direction the deflection will be seen in the\r\ndirection in which the column is least stiff. This sidewise\r\nbending can be overcome by making pillars and columns thicker in\r\nthe middle than at the ends, and by bracing studding, props, and\r\ncompression members of trusses.

(See Table\r\nV.) In other words, the transverse strength of beams at elastic\r\nlimit is practically equal to the compressive strength of the\r\nsame material in short columns. It is accordingly possible to\r\ncalculate the approximate breaking strength of beams from the\r\ncompressive strength of short columns except when the wood is\r\nbrittle. Since tests on endwise compression are simpler, easier\r\nto make, and less expensive than transverse bending tests, the\r\nimportance of this relation is obvious, though it does not do\r\naway with the necessity of making beam tests.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See Circular No. 18, U.S. Division of Forestry:\r\nProgress in timber physics, pp. 13-18; also Bulletin 70, U.S.\r\nForest Service: Effect of moisture on the strength and stiffness\r\nof wood, pp. 42, 89-90.]\r\n\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                                    TABLE V                                    |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|   RELATION OF FIBRE STRESS AT ELASTIC LIMIT (r) IN BENDING TO THE CRUSHING    |\r\n|        STRENGTH (C) OF BLOCKS CUT THEREFROM,  IN POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH       |\r\n|                        (Forest Service Bul. 70, p. 90)                        |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                                 LONGLEAF PINE                                 |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                          | Soaked | Green  | 14    | 11.5  | 9.5   | Kiln-dry |\r\n|    MOISTURE CONDITION    | 50 per | 23 per | per   | per   | per   | 6.2 per  |\r\n|                          | cent   | cent   | cent  | cent  | cent  | cent     |\r\n| -------------------------+--------+--------+-------+-------+-------+----------|\r\n| Number of tests averaged |      5 |      5 |     5 |     5 |     4 |        5 |\r\n| _r_ in bending           |  4,920 |  5,944 | 6,924 | 7,852 | 9,280 |   11,550 |\r\n| _C_ in compression       |  4,668 |  5,100 | 6,466 | 7,466 | 8,985 |   10,910 |\r\n| Per cent _r_ is in       |        |        |       |       |       |          |\r\n|   excess of _C_          |    5.5 |   16.5 |   7.1 |   5.2 |   3.3 |      5.9 |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                                    SPRUCE                                     |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                                  | Soaked | Green  | 10    | 8.1   | Kiln-dry |\r\n|        MOISTURE CONDITION        | 30 per | 30 per | per   | per   | 3.9 per  |\r\n|                                  | cent   | cent   | cent  | cent  | cent     |\r\n|----------------------------------+--------+--------+-------+-------+----------|\r\n| Number of tests averaged         |      5 |      4 |     5 |     3 |        4 |\r\n| _r_ in bending                   |  3,002 |  3,362 | 6,458 | 8,400 |   10,170 |\r\n| _C_ in compression               |  2,680 |  3,025 | 6,120 | 7,610 |    9,335 |\r\n| Per cent _r_                     |        |        |       |       |          |\r\n|   is in excess of _C_            |   12.0 |   11.1 |   5.5 |  10.4 |      9.0 |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n\r\nWhen a short column is compressed until it breaks, the manner of\r\nfailure depends partly upon the anatomical structure and partly\r\nupon the degree of humidity of the wood. The fibres (tracheids\r\nin conifers) act as hollow tubes bound closely together, and in\r\ngiving way they either (1) buckle, or (2) bend.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: See Bulletin 70, _op. cit._, p. 129.]\r\n\r\nThe first is typical of any dry thin-walled cells, as is usually\r\nthe case in seasoned white pine and spruce, and in the early\r\nwood of hard pines, hemlock, and other species with decided\r\ncontrast between the two portions of the growth ring. As a rule\r\nbuckling of a tracheid begins at the bordered pits which form\r\nplaces of least resistance in the walls. In hardwoods such as\r\noak, chestnut, ash, etc., buckling occurs only in the\r\nthinnest-walled elements, such as the vessels, and not in the\r\ntrue fibres.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jaccard[6] the folding of the cells is accompanied\r\nby characteristic alterations of their walls which seem to split\r\nthem into extremely thin layers. When greatly magnified, these\r\nlayers appear in longitudinal sections as delicate threads\r\nwithout any definite arrangements, while on cross section they\r\nappear as numerous concentric strata. This may be explained on\r\nthe ground that the growth of a fibre is by successive layers\r\nwhich, under the influence of compression, are sheared apart.\r\nThis is particularly the case with thick-walled cells such as\r\nare found in late wood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Jaccard, P.: Étude anatomique des bois comprimés.\r\nMit. d.

In\r\nwoods in which the fibre walls show all gradations of\r\nthickness--in other words, where the transition from the\r\nthin-walled cells of the early wood to the thick-walled cells of\r\nthe late wood is gradual--the two kinds of failure, namely,\r\nbuckling and bending, grade into each other. In woods with very\r\ndecided contrast between early and late wood the two forms are\r\nusually distinct. Except in the case of complete failure the\r\ncavity of the deformed cells remains open, and in hardwoods this\r\nis true not only of the wood fibres but also of the tube-like\r\nvessels. In many cases longitudinal splits occur which isolate\r\nbundles of elements by greater or less intervals. The splitting\r\noccurs by a tearing of the fibres or rays and not by the\r\nseparation of the rays from the adjacent elements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Failures of short columns of green\r\nspruce.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Failures of short columns of dry\r\nchestnut.]\r\n\r\nMoisture in wood decreases the stiffness of the fibre walls and\r\nenlarges the region of failure. The curve which the fibre walls\r\nmake in the region of failure is more gradual and also more\r\nirregular than in dry wood, and the fibres are more likely to be\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nIn examining the lines of rupture in compression parallel to the\r\ngrain it appears that there does not exist any specific type,\r\nthat is, one that is characteristic of all woods. Test blocks\r\ntaken from different parts of the same log may show very decided\r\ndifferences in the manner of failure, while blocks that are much\r\nalike in the size, number, and distribution of the elements of\r\nunequal resistance may behave very similarly. The direction of\r\nrupture is, according to Jaccard, not influenced by the\r\ndistribution of the medullary rays.[7] These are curved with the\r\nbundles of fibres to which they are attached. In any case the\r\nfailure starts at the weakest points and follows the lines of\r\nleast resistance. The plane of failure, as visible on radial\r\nsurfaces, is horizontal, and on the tangential surface it is\r\ndiagonal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: This does not correspond exactly with the\r\nconclusions of A. Thil, who says (\"Constitution anatomique du\r\nbois,\" pp. 140-141): \"The sides of the medullary rays sometimes\r\nproduce planes of least resistance varying in size with the\r\nheight of the rays. The medullary rays assume a direction more\r\nor less parallel to the lumen of the cells on which they border;\r\nthe latter curve to the right or left to make room for the ray\r\nand then close again beyond it. If the force acts parallel to\r\nthe axis of growth, the tracheids are more likely to be\r\ndisplaced if the marginal cells of the medullary rays are\r\nprovided with weak walls that are readily compressed. This\r\nexplains why on the radial surface of the test blocks the plane\r\nof rupture passes in a direction nearly following a medullary\r\nray, whereas on the tangential surface the direction of the\r\nplane of rupture is oblique--but with an obliquity varying with\r\nthe species and determined by the pitch of the spirals along\r\nwhich the medullary rays are distributed in the stem.\" See\r\nJaccard, _op. cit._, pp. 57 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEARING STRENGTH\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever forces act upon a body in such a way that one portion\r\ntends to slide upon another adjacent to it the action is called\r\na ~shear~.[8] In wood this shearing action may be (1) ~along the\r\ngrain~, or (2) ~across the grain~. A tenon breaking out its\r\nmortise is a familiar example of shear along the grain, while\r\nthe shoving off of the tenon itself would be shear across the\r\ngrain. The use of wood for pins or tree-nails involves\r\nresistance to shear across the grain. Another common instance of\r\nthe latter is where the steel edge of the eye of an axe or\r\nhammer tends to cut off the handle. In Fig. 10 the action of the\r\nwooden strut tends to shear off along the grain the portion _AB_\r\nof the wooden tie rod, and it is essential that the length of\r\nthis portion be great enough to guard against it. Fig. 11 shows\r\ncharacteristic failures in shear along the grain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Shear should not be confused with ordinary cutting\r\nor incision.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Example of shear along the grain.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Failures of test specimens in shear\r\nalong the grain.

Thus the weight\r\ncarried by a beam tends to shear it off at right angles to the\r\naxis; this stress is equal to the resultant force acting\r\nperpendicularly at any point, and in a beam uniformly loaded and\r\nsupported at either end is maximum at the points of support and\r\nzero at the centre. In addition there is a shearing force\r\ntending to move the fibres of the beam past each other in a\r\nlongitudinal direction. (See Fig. 12.) This longitudinal shear\r\nis maximum at the neutral plane and decreases toward the upper\r\nand lower surfaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Horizontal shear in a beam.]\r\n\r\nShearing across the grain is so closely related to compression\r\nat right angles to the grain and to hardness that there is\r\nlittle to be gained by making separate tests upon it. Knowledge\r\nof shear parallel to the grain is important, since wood\r\nfrequently fails in that way. The value of shearing stress\r\nparallel to the grain is found by dividing the maximum load in\r\npounds (P) by the area of the cross section in inches (A).\r\n\r\n     {          P  }\r\n     { Shear = --- }\r\n     {          A  }\r\n\r\nOblique shearing stresses are developed in a bar when it is\r\nsubjected to direct tension or compression. The maximum shearing\r\nstress occurs along a plane when it makes an angle of 45 degrees\r\n                                                       P\r\nwith the axis of the specimen.

Thus the fibres half-way between the\r\nneutral plane and the outer surface experience only half as much\r\nshortening or elongation as the outermost or extreme fibres.\r\nSimilarly for other distances. The elements along the neutral\r\nplane experience no tension or compression in an axial\r\ndirection. The line of intersection of this plane and the plane\r\nof section is known as the ~neutral axis~ (N A in Fig. 15) of\r\nthe section.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: While in reality this relationship does not exactly\r\nhold, the formulæ for beams are based on its assumption.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Diagram of a simple beam. N_{1} P =\r\nneutral plane, N A = neutral axis of section R S.]\r\n\r\nIf the bar is symmetrical and homogeneous the neutral plane is\r\nlocated half-way between the upper and lower surfaces, so long\r\nas the deflection does not exceed the elastic limit of the\r\nmaterial. Owing to the fact that the tensile strength of wood is\r\nfrom two to nearly four times the compressive strength, it\r\nfollows that at rupture the neutral plane is much nearer the\r\nconvex than the concave side of the bar or beam, since the sum\r\nof all the compressive stresses on the concave portion must\r\nalways equal the sum of the tensile stresses on the convex\r\nportion. The neutral plane begins to change from its central\r\nposition as soon as the elastic limit has been passed. Its\r\nlocation at any time is very uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe external forces acting to bend the bar also tend to rupture\r\nit at right angles to the neutral plane by causing one\r\ntransverse section to slip past another. This stress at any\r\npoint is equal to the resultant perpendicular to the axis of the\r\nforces acting at this point, and is termed the ~transverse\r\nshear~ (or in the case of beams, ~vertical shear~).\r\n\r\nIn addition to this there is a shearing stress, tending to move\r\nthe fibres past one another in an axial direction, which is\r\ncalled ~longitudinal shear~ (or in the case of beams,\r\n~horizontal shear~). This stress must be taken into\r\nconsideration in the design of timber structures. It is maximum\r\nat the neutral plane and decreases to zero at the outer elements\r\nof the section. The shorter the span of a beam in proportion to\r\nits height, the greater is the liability of failure in\r\nhorizontal shear before the ultimate strength of the beam is\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beams_\r\n\r\nThere are three common forms of beams, as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) ~Simple beam~--a bar resting upon two supports, one near\r\neach end. (See Fig. 16, No. 1.)\r\n\r\n(2) ~Cantilever beam~--a bar resting upon one support or\r\nfulcrum, or that portion of any beam projecting out of a wall or\r\nbeyond a support. (See Fig. 16, No. 2.)\r\n\r\n(3) ~Continuous beam~--a bar resting upon more than two\r\nsupports. (See Fig. 16, No. 3.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Three common forms of beams. 1. Simple.\r\n2. Cantilever. 3. Continuous.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stiffness of Beams_\r\n\r\nThe two main requirements of a beam are stiffness and strength.\r\nThe formulæ for the _modulus of elasticity (E)_ or measure of\r\nstiffness of a rectangular prismatic simple beam loaded at the\r\ncentre and resting freely on supports at either end is:[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Only this form of beam is considered since it is\r\nthe simplest. For cantilever and continuous beams, and beams\r\nrigidly fixed at one or both ends, as well as for different\r\nmethods of loading, different forms of cross section, etc.,\r\nother formulæ are required. See any book on mechanics.]\r\n\r\n           P' l^{3}\r\n     E = -------------\r\n          4 D b h^{3}\r\n\r\n   b = breadth or width of beam, inches.\r\n   h = height or depth of beam, inches.\r\n   l = span (length between points of supports) of beam, inches.\r\n   D = deflection produced by load P', inches.\r\n  P' = load at or below elastic limit, pounds.\r\n\r\nFrom this formulæ it is evident that for rectangular beams of\r\nthe same material, mode of support, and loading, the deflection\r\nis affected as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) It is inversely proportional to the width for beams of the\r\nsame length and depth. If the width is tripled the deflection is\r\none-third as great.\r\n\r\n(2) It is inversely proportional to the cube of the depth for\r\nbeams of the same length and breadth. If the depth is tripled\r\nthe deflection is one twenty-seventh as great.\r\n\r\n(3) It is directly proportional to the cube of the span for\r\nbeams of the same breadth and depth. Tripling the span gives\r\ntwenty-seven times the deflection.\r\n\r\nThe number of pounds which concentrated at the centre will\r\ndeflect a rectangular prismatic simple beam one inch may be\r\nfound from the preceding formulæ by substituting D = 1\" and\r\nsolving for P'. The formulæ then becomes:\r\n\r\n                              4 E b h^{3}\r\n     Necessary weight (P') = -------------\r\n                                 l^{3}\r\n\r\nIn this case the values for E are read from tables prepared from\r\ndata obtained by experimentation on the given material.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Strength of Beams_\r\n\r\nThe measure of the breaking strength of a beam is expressed in\r\nterms of unit stress by a _modulus of rupture_, which is a\r\npurely hypothetical expression for points beyond the elastic\r\nlimit. The formulæ used in computing this modulus is as follows:\r\n\r\n          1.5 P l\r\n     R = ---------\r\n          b h{^2}\r\n\r\n  b, h, l = breadth, height, and span, respectively, as in\r\n    preceding formulæ.\r\n  R = modulus of rupture, pounds per square inch.\r\n  P = maximum load, pounds.\r\n\r\nIn calculating the fibre stress at the elastic limit the same\r\nformulæ is used except that the load at elastic limit (P_{1}) is\r\nsubstituted for the maximum load (P).\r\n\r\nFrom this formulæ it is evident that for rectangular prismatic\r\nbeams of the same material, mode of support, and loading, the\r\nload which a given beam can support varies as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) It is directly proportional to the breadth for beams of the\r\nsame length and depth, as is the case with stiffness.\r\n\r\n(2) It is directly proportional to the square of the height for\r\nbeams of the same length and breadth, instead of as the cube of\r\nthis dimension as in stiffness.\r\n\r\n(3) It is inversely proportional to the span for beams of the\r\nsame breadth and depth and not to the cube of this dimension as\r\nin stiffness.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the strength varies as the _square_ of the height\r\nand the stiffness as the _cube_ explains the relationship of\r\nbending to thickness. Were the law the same for strength and\r\nstiffness a thin piece of material such as a sheet of paper\r\ncould not be bent any further without breaking than a thick\r\npiece, say an inch board.\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                                      TABLE IX

|\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kinds of Loads_\r\n\r\nThere are various ways in which beams are loaded, of which the\r\nfollowing are the most important:\r\n\r\n(1) ~Uniform load~ occurs where the load is spread evenly over\r\nthe beam.\r\n\r\n(2) ~Concentrated load~ occurs where the load is applied at\r\nsingle point or points.\r\n\r\n(3) ~Live~ or ~immediate load~ is one of momentary or short\r\nduration at any one point, such as occurs in crossing a bridge.\r\n\r\n(4) ~Dead~ or ~permanent load~ is one of constant and\r\nindeterminate duration, as books on a shelf. In the case of a\r\nbridge the weight of the structure itself is the dead load. All\r\nlarge beams support a uniform dead load consisting of their own\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nThe effect of dead load on a wooden beam may be two or more\r\ntimes that produced by an immediate load of the same weight.\r\nLoads greater than the elastic limit are unsafe and will\r\ngenerally result in rupture if continued long enough. A beam may\r\nbe considered safe under permanent load when the deflections\r\ndiminish during equal successive periods of time. A continual\r\nincrease in deflection indicates an unsafe load which is almost\r\ncertain to rupture the beam eventually.\r\n\r\nVariations in the humidity of the surrounding air influence the\r\ndeflection of dry wood under dead load, and increased\r\ndeflections during damp weather are cumulative and not recovered\r\nby subsequent drying. In the case of longleaf pine, dry beams\r\nmay with safety be loaded permanently to within three-fourths of\r\ntheir elastic limit as determined from ordinary static tests.\r\nIncreased moisture content, due to greater humidity of the air,\r\nlowers the elastic limit of wood so that what was a safe load\r\nfor the dry material may become unsafe.\r\n\r\nWhen a dead load not great enough to rupture a beam has been\r\nremoved, the beam tends gradually to recover its former shape,\r\nbut the recovery is not always complete. If specimens from such\r\na beam are tested in the ordinary testing machine it will be\r\nfound that the application of the dead load did not affect the\r\nstiffness, ultimate strength, or elastic limit of the material.\r\nIn other words, the deflections and recoveries produced by live\r\nloads are the same as would have been produced had not the beam\r\npreviously been subjected to a dead load.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: See Tiemann, Harry D.: Some results of dead load\r\nbending tests of timber by means of a recording deflectometer.\r\nProc. Am. Soc. for Testing Materials. Phila. Vol. IX, 1909, pp.\r\n534-548.]\r\n\r\n~Maximum load~ is the greatest load a material will support and\r\nis usually greater than the load at rupture.\r\n\r\n~Safe load~ is the load considered safe for a material to\r\nsupport in actual practice. It is always less than the load at\r\nelastic limit and is usually taken as a certain proportion of\r\nthe ultimate or breaking load.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of the breaking to the safe load is called the factor\r\nof safety. (Factor of safety = ultimate strength / safe load) In\r\norder to make due allowance for the natural variations and\r\nimperfections in wood and in the aggregate structure, as well as\r\nfor variations in the load, the factor of safety is usually as\r\nhigh as 6 or 10, especially if the safety of human life depends\r\nupon the structure. This means that only from one-sixth to\r\none-tenth of the computed strength values is considered safe to\r\nuse. If the depth of timbers exceeds four times their thickness\r\nthere is a great tendency for the material to twist when loaded.\r\nIt is to overcome this tendency that floor joists are braced at\r\nfrequent intervals. Short deep pieces shear out or split before\r\ntheir strength in bending can fully come into play.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Application of Loads_\r\n\r\nThere are three[12] general methods in which loads may be\r\napplied to beams, namely:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: A fourth might be added, namely, ~vibratory~, or\r\n~harmonic repetition~, which is frequently serious in the case\r\nof bridges.]\r\n\r\n(1) ~Static loading~ or the gradual imposition of load so that\r\nthe moving parts acquire no appreciable momentum. Loads are so\r\napplied in the ordinary testing machine.\r\n\r\n(2) ~Sudden imposition of load without initial velocity.~ \"Thus\r\nin the case of placing a load on a beam, if the load be brought\r\ninto contact with the beam, but its weight sustained by external\r\nmeans, as by a cord, and then this external support be\r\n_suddenly_ (instantaneously) removed, as by quickly cutting the\r\ncord, then, although the load is already touching the beam (and\r\nhence there is no real impact), yet the beam is at first\r\noffering no resistance, as it has yet suffered no deformation.\r\nFurthermore, as the beam deflects the resistance increases, but\r\ndoes not come to be equal to the load until it has attained its\r\nnormal deflection. In the meantime there has been an unbalanced\r\nforce of gravity acting, of a constantly diminishing amount,\r\nequal at first to the entire load, at the normal deflection. But\r\nat this instant the load and the beam are in motion, the\r\nhitherto unbalanced force having produced an accelerated\r\nvelocity, and this velocity of the weight and beam gives to them\r\nan energy, or _vis viva_, which must now spend itself in\r\novercoming an _excess_ of resistance over and above the imposed\r\nload, and the whole mass will not stop until the deflection (as\r\nwell as the resistance) has come to be equal to _twice_ that\r\ncorresponding to the static load imposed. Hence we say the\r\neffect of a suddenly imposed load is to produce twice the\r\ndeflection and stress of the same load statically applied. It\r\nmust be evident, however, that this case has nothing in common\r\nwith either the ordinary 'static' tests of structural materials\r\nin testing-machines, or with impact tests.\"[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Johnson, J.B.: The materials of construction, pp.\r\n81-82.]\r\n\r\n(3) ~Impact, shock,~ or ~blow.~[14] There are various common\r\nuses of wood where the material is subjected to sudden shocks\r\nand jars or impact. Such is the action on the felloes and spokes\r\nof a wagon wheel passing over a rough road; on a hammer handle\r\nwhen a blow is struck; on a maul when it strikes a wedge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: See Tiemann, Harry D.: The theory of impact and\r\nits application to testing materials. Jour. Franklin Inst.,\r\nOct., Nov., 1909, pp. 235-259, 336-364.]\r\n\r\nResistance to impact is resistance to energy which is measured\r\nby the product of the force into the space through which it\r\nmoves, or by the product of one-half the moving mass which\r\ncauses the shock into the square of its velocity. The work done\r\nupon the piece at the instant the velocity is entirely removed\r\nfrom the striking body is equal to the total energy of that\r\nbody. It is impossible, however, to get all of the energy of the\r\nstriking body stored in the specimen, though the greater the\r\nmass and the shorter the space through which it moves, or, in\r\nother words, the greater the proportion of weight and the\r\nsmaller the proportion of velocity making up the energy of the\r\nstriking body, the more energy the specimen will absorb. The\r\nrest is lost in friction, vibrations, heat, and motion of the\r\nanvil.\r\n\r\nIn impact the stresses produced become very complex and\r\ndifficult to measure, especially if the velocity is high, or the\r\nmass of the beam itself is large compared to that of the weight.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties attending the measurement of the stresses\r\nbeyond the elastic limit are so great that commonly they are not\r\nreckoned. Within the elastic limit the formulæ for calculating\r\nthe stresses are based on the assumption that the deflection is\r\nproportional to the stress in this case as in static tests.\r\n\r\nA common method of making tests upon the resistance of wood to\r\nshock is to support a small beam at the ends and drop a heavy\r\nweight upon it in the middle. (See Fig. 40.) The height of the\r\nweight is increased after each drop and records of the\r\ndeflection taken until failure. The total work done upon the\r\nspecimen is equal to the area of the stress-strain diagram plus\r\nthe effect of local inertia of the molecules at point of\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nThe stresses involved in impact are complicated by the fact that\r\nthere are various ways in which the energy of the striking body\r\nmay be spent:\r\n\r\n(_a_) It produces a local deformation of both bodies at the\r\nsurface of contact, within or beyond the elastic limit. In\r\ntesting wood the compression of the substance of the steel\r\nstriking-weight may be neglected, since the steel is very hard\r\nin comparison with the wood. In addition to the compression of\r\nthe fibres at the surface of contact resistance is also offered\r\nby the inertia of the particles there, the combined effect of\r\nwhich is a stress at the surface of contact often entirely out\r\nof proportion to the compression which would result from the\r\naction of a static force of the same magnitude. It frequently\r\nexceeds the crushing strength at the extreme surface of contact,\r\nas in the case of the swaging action of a hammer on the head of\r\nan iron spike, or of a locomotive wheel on the steel rail. This\r\nis also the case when a bullet is shot through a board or a pane\r\nof glass without breaking it as a whole.\r\n\r\n(_b_) It may move the struck body as a whole with an accelerated\r\nvelocity, the resistance consisting of the inertia of the body.\r\nThis effect is seen when a croquet ball is struck with a mallet.\r\n\r\n(_c_) It may deform a fixed body against its external supports\r\nand resistances. In making impact tests in the laboratory the\r\ntest specimen is in reality in the nature of a cushion between\r\ntwo impacting bodies, namely, the striking weight and the base\r\nof the machine. It is important that the mass of this base be\r\nsufficiently great that its relative velocity to that of the\r\ncommon centre of gravity of itself and the striking weight may\r\nbe disregarded.\r\n\r\n(_d_) It may deform the struck body as a whole against the\r\nresisting stresses developed by its own inertia, as, for\r\nexample, when a baseball bat is broken by striking the ball.\r\n\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                        TABLE X                        |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| RESULTS OF IMPACT BENDING TESTS ON SMALL CLEAR BEAMS  |\r\n|            OF 34 WOODS IN GREEN CONDITION             |\r\n|               (Forest Service Cir. 213)               |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                   |   Fibre   |            | Work in  |\r\n|    COMMON NAME    | stress at | Modulus of | bending  |\r\n|    OF SPECIES     |  elastic  | elasticity |    to    |\r\n|                   |   limit   |            | elastic  |\r\n|                   |           |            |  limit   |\r\n|-------------------+-----------+------------+----------|\r\n|                   |           |            | In.-lbs. |\r\n|                   | Lbs. per  |  Lbs. per  | per cu.  |\r\n|                   | sq. in.   |  sq. in.   | inch     |\r\n|                   |           |            |          |\r\n|    Hardwoods      |           |            |          |\r\n|                   |           |            |          |\r\n| Ash, black        |    7,840  |    955,000 |    3.69  |\r\n|   white           |   11,710  |  1,564,000 |    4.93  |\r\n| Basswood          |    5,480  |    917,000 |    1.84  |\r\n| Beech             |   11,760  |  1,501,000 |    5.10  |\r\n| Birch, yellow     |   11,080  |  1,812,000 |    3.79  |\r\n| Elm, rock         |   12,090  |  1,367,000 |    6.52  |\r\n|   slippery        |   11,700  |  1,569,000 |    4.86  |\r\n|   white           |    9,910  |  1,138,000 |    4.82  |\r\n| Hackberry         |   10,420  |  1,398,000 |    4.48  |\r\n| Locust, honey     |   13,460  |  2,114,000 |    4.76  |\r\n| Maple, red        |   11,670  |  1,411,000 |    5.45  |\r\n|   sugar           |   11,680  |  1,680,000 |    4.55  |\r\n| Oak, post         |   11,260  |  1,596,000 |    4.41  |\r\n|   red             |   10,580  |  1,506,000 |    4.16  |\r\n|   swamp white     |   13,280  |  2,048,000 |    4.79  |\r\n|   white           |    9,860  |  1,414,000 |    3.84  |\r\n|   yellow          |   10,840  |  1,479,000 |    4.44  |\r\n| Osage orange      |   15,520  |  1,498,000 |    8.92  |\r\n| Sycamore          |    8,180  |  1,165,000 |    3.22  |\r\n| Tupelo            |    7,650  |  1,310,000 |    2.49  |\r\n|                   |           |            |          |\r\n|    Conifers       |           |            |          |\r\n|                   |           |            |          |\r\n| Arborvitæ         |    5,290  |    778,000 |    2.04  |\r\n| Cypress, bald     |    8,290  |  1,431,000 |    2.71  |\r\n| Fir, alpine       |    5,280  |    980,000 |    1.59  |\r\n|   Douglas         |    8,870  |  1,579,000 |    2.79  |\r\n|   white           |    7,230  |  1,326,000 |    2.21  |\r\n| Hemlock           |    6,330  |  1,025,000 |    2.19  |\r\n| Pine, lodgepole   |    6,870  |  1,142,000 |    2.31  |\r\n|   longleaf        |    9,680  |  1,739,000 |    3.02  |\r\n|   red             |    7,480  |  1,438,000 |    2.18  |\r\n|   sugar           |    6,740  |  1,083,000 |    2.34  |\r\n|   western yellow  |    7,070  |  1,115,000 |    2.51  |\r\n|   white           |    6,490  |  1,156,000 |    2.06  |\r\n| Spruce, Engelmann |    6,300  |  1,076,000 |    2.09  |\r\n| Tamarack          |    7,750  |  1,263,000 |    2.67  |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------|\r\n\r\nImpact testing is difficult to conduct satisfactorily and the\r\ndata obtained are of chief value in a relative sense, that is,\r\nfor comparing the shock-resisting ability of woods of which like\r\nspecimens have been subjected to exactly identical treatment.\r\nYet this test is one of the most important made on wood, as it\r\nbrings out properties not evident from other tests. Defects and\r\nbrittleness are revealed by impact better than by any other kind\r\nof test. In common practice nearly all external stresses are of\r\nthe nature of impact. In fact, no two moving bodies can come\r\ntogether without impact stress. Impact is therefore the\r\ncommonest form of applied stress, although the most difficult to\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Failures in Timber Beams_\r\n\r\nIf a beam is loaded too heavily it will break or fail in some\r\ncharacteristic manner. These failures may be classified\r\naccording to the way in which they develop, as tension,\r\ncompression, and horizontal shear; and according to the\r\nappearance of the broken surface, as brash, and fibrous. A\r\nnumber of forms may develop if the beam is completely ruptured.\r\n\r\nSince the tensile strength of wood is on the average about three\r\ntimes as great as the compressive strength, a beam should,\r\ntherefore, be expected to fail by the formation in the first\r\nplace of a fold on the compression side due to the crushing\r\naction, followed by failure on the tension side. This is usually\r\nthe case in green or moist wood. In dry material the first\r\nvisible failure is not infrequently on the lower or tension\r\nside, and various attempts have been made to explain why such is\r\nthe case.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: See Proc. Int. Assn. for Testing Materials, 1912,\r\nXXIII_{2}, pp. 12-13.]\r\n\r\nWithin the elastic limit the elongations and shortenings are\r\nequal, and the neutral plane lies in the middle of the beam.\r\n(See TRANSVERSE OR BENDING STRENGTH: BEAMS, above.) Later the\r\ntop layer of fibres on the upper or compression side fail, and\r\non the load increasing, the next layer of fibres fail, and so\r\non, even though this failure may not be visible. As a result the\r\nshortenings on the upper side of the beam become considerably\r\ngreater than the elongations on the lower side. The neutral\r\nplane must be presumed to sink gradually toward the tension\r\nside, and when the stresses on the outer fibres at the bottom\r\nhave become sufficiently great, the fibres are pulled in two,\r\nthe tension area being much smaller than the compression area.\r\nThe rupture is often irregular, as in direct tension tests.\r\nFailure may occur partially in single bundles of fibres some\r\ntime before the final failure takes place. One reason why the\r\nfailure of a dry beam is different from one that is moist, is\r\nthat drying increases the stiffness of the fibres so that they\r\noffer more resistance to crushing, while it has much less effect\r\nupon the tensile strength.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable variation in tension failures depending\r\nupon the toughness or the brittleness of the wood, the\r\narrangement of the grain, defects, etc., making further\r\nclassification desirable. The four most common forms are:\r\n\r\n(1)~Simple tension,~ in which there is a direct pulling in two\r\nof the wood on the under side of the beam due to a tensile\r\nstress parallel to the grain, (See Fig. 17, No. 1.) This is\r\ncommon in straight-grained beams, particularly when the wood is\r\nseasoned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Characteristic failures of simple\r\nbeams.]\r\n\r\n(2)~Cross-grained tension,~ in which the fracture is caused by a\r\ntensile force acting oblique to the grain. (See Fig. 17, No. 2.)\r\nThis is a common form of failure where the beam has diagonal,\r\nspiral or other form of cross grain on its lower side. Since the\r\ntensile strength of wood across the grain is only a small\r\nfraction of that with the grain it is easy to see why a\r\ncross-grained timber would fail in this manner.\r\n\r\n(3)~Splintering tension,~ in which the failure consists of a\r\nconsiderable number of slight tension failures, producing a\r\nragged or splintery break on the under surface of the beam. (See\r\nFig. 17, No. 3.) This is common in tough woods. In this case the\r\nsurface of fracture is fibrous.\r\n\r\n(4)~Brittle tension,~ in which the beam fails by a clean break\r\nextending entirely through it. (See Fig. 17, No. 4.) It is\r\ncharacteristic of a brittle wood which gives way suddenly\r\nwithout warning, like a piece of chalk. In this case the surface\r\nof fracture is described as brash.\r\n\r\n~Compression failure~ (see Fig. 17, No. 5) has few variations\r\nexcept that it appears at various distances from the neutral\r\nplane of the beam. It is very common in green timbers. The\r\ncompressive stress parallel to the fibres causes them to buckle\r\nor bend as in an endwise compressive test. This action usually\r\nbegins on the top side shortly after the elastic limit is\r\nreached and extends downward, sometimes almost reaching the\r\nneutral plane before complete failure occurs. Frequently two or\r\nmore failures develop at about the same time.\r\n\r\n~Horizontal shear failure,~ in which the upper and lower\r\nportions of the beam slide along each other for a portion of\r\ntheir length either at one or at both ends (see Fig. 17, No. 6),\r\nis fairly common in air-dry material and in green material when\r\nthe ratio of the height of the beam to the span is relatively\r\nlarge. It is not common in small clear specimens. It is often\r\ndue to shake or season checks, common in large timbers, which\r\nreduce the actual area resisting the shearing action\r\nconsiderably below the calculated area used in the formulæ for\r\nhorizontal shear. (See page 98 for this formulæ.) For this\r\nreason it is unsafe, in designing large timber beams, to use\r\nshearing stresses higher than those calculated for beams that\r\nfailed in horizontal shear. The effect of a failure in\r\nhorizontal shear is to divide the beam into two or more beams\r\nthe combined strength of which is much less than that of the\r\noriginal beam. Fig. 18 shows a large beam in which two failures\r\nin horizontal shear occurred at the same end.

Again,\r\na tough wood is one that will not rupture until it has deformed\r\nconsiderably under loads at or near its maximum strength, or one\r\nwhich still hangs together after it has been ruptured and may be\r\nbent back and forth without breaking apart. Toughness includes\r\nflexibility and is the reverse of brittleness, in that tough\r\nwoods break gradually and give warning of failure. Tough woods\r\noffer great resistance to impact and will permit rougher\r\ntreatment in manipulations attending manufacture and use.\r\nToughness is dependent upon the strength, cohesion, quality,\r\nlength, and arrangement of fibre, and the pliability of the\r\nwood. Coniferous woods as a rule are not as tough as hardwoods,\r\nof which hickory and elm are the best examples.\r\n\r\nThe torsion or twisting test is useful in determining the\r\ntoughness of wood. If the ends of a shaft are turned in opposite\r\ndirections, or one end is turned and the other is fixed, all of\r\nthe fibres except those at the axis tend to assume the form of\r\nhelices. (See Fig. 19.) The strain produced by torsion or\r\ntwisting is essentially shear transverse and parallel to the\r\nfibres, combined with longitudinal tension and transverse\r\ncompression. Within the elastic limit the strains increase\r\ndirectly as the distance from the axis of the specimen. The\r\nouter elements are subjected to tensile stresses, and as they\r\nbecome twisted tend to compress those near the axis. The\r\nelongated elements also contract laterally. Cross sections which\r\nwere originally plane become warped. With increasing strain the\r\nlateral adhesion of the outer fibres is destroyed, allowing them\r\nto slide past each other, and reducing greatly their power of\r\nresistance. In this way the strains on the fibres nearer the\r\naxis are progressively increased until finally all of the\r\nelements are sheared apart. It is only in the toughest materials\r\nthat the full effect of this action can be observed. (See Fig.\r\n20.) Brittle woods snap off suddenly with only a small amount of\r\ntorsion, and their fracture is irregular and oblique to the axis\r\nof the piece instead of frayed out and more nearly perpendicular\r\nto the axis as is the case with tough woods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Torsion of a shaft.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Effect of torsion on different grades\r\nof hickory. _Photo by U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term _hardness_ is used in two senses, namely: (1)\r\nresistance to indentation, and (2) resistance to abrasion or\r\nscratching. In the latter sense hardness combined with toughness\r\nis a measure of the wearing ability of wood and is an important\r\nconsideration in the use of wood for floors, paving blocks,\r\nbearings, and rollers. While resistance to indentation is\r\ndependent mostly upon the density of the wood, the wearing\r\nqualities may be governed by other factors such as toughness,\r\nand the size, cohesion, and arrangement of the fibres. In use\r\nfor floors, some woods tend to compact and wear smooth, while\r\nothers become splintery and rough. This feature is affected to\r\nsome extent by the manner in which the wood is sawed; thus\r\nedge-grain pine flooring is much better than flat-sawn for\r\nuniformity of wear.\r\n\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                             TABLE XII                             |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|             HARDNESS OF 32 WOODS IN GREEN CONDITION,              |\r\n|            AS INDICATED BY THE LOAD REQUIRED TO IMBED             |\r\n|         A 0.444-INCH STEEL BALL TO ONE-HALF ITS DIAMETER          |\r\n|                     (Forest Service Cir. 213)                     |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| COMMON NAME OF SPECIES | Average |   End   | Radial  | Tangential |\r\n|                        |         | surface | surface |  surface   |\r\n|------------------------+---------+---------+---------+------------|\r\n|                        |  Pounds |  Pounds |  Pounds |   Pounds   |\r\n|                        |         |         |         |            |\r\n|    Hardwoods           |         |         |         |            |\r\n|                        |         |         |         |            |\r\n|  1 Osage orange        |   1,971 |   1,838 |   2,312 |    1,762   |\r\n|  2 Honey locust        |   1,851 |   1,862 |   1,860 |    1,832   |\r\n|  3 Swamp white oak     |   1,174 |   1,205 |   1,217 |    1,099   |\r\n|  4 White oak           |   1,164 |   1,183 |   1,163 |    1,147   |\r\n|  5 Post oak            |   1,099 |   1,139 |   1,068 |    1,081   |\r\n|  6 Black oak           |   1,069 |   1,093 |   1,083 |    1,031   |\r\n|  7 Red oak             |   1,043 |   1,107 |   1,020 |    1,002   |\r\n|  8 White ash           |   1,046 |   1,121 |   1,000 |    1,017   |\r\n|  9 Beech               |     942 |   1,012 |     897 |      918   |\r\n| 10 Sugar maple         |     937 |     992 |     918 |      901   |\r\n| 11 Rock elm            |     910 |     954 |     883 |      893   |\r\n| 12 Hackberry           |     799 |     829 |     795 |      773   |\r\n| 13 Slippery elm        |     788 |     919 |     757 |      687   |\r\n| 14 Yellow birch        |     778 |     827 |     768 |      739   |\r\n| 15 Tupelo              |     738 |     814 |     666 |      733   |\r\n| 16 Red maple           |     671 |     766 |     621 |      626   |\r\n| 17 Sycamore            |     608 |     664 |     560 |      599   |\r\n| 18 Black ash           |     551 |     565 |     542 |      546   |\r\n| 19 White elm           |     496 |     536 |     456 |      497   |\r\n| 20 Basswood            |     239 |     273 |     226 |      217   |\r\n|                        |         |         |         |            |\r\n|    Conifers            |         |         |         |            |\r\n|                        |         |         |         |            |\r\n|  1 Longleaf pine       |    532  |     574 |     502 |      521   |\r\n|  2 Douglas fir         |    410  |     415 |     399 |      416   |\r\n|  3 Bald cypress        |    390  |     460 |     355 |      354   |\r\n|  4 Hemlock             |    384  |     463 |     354 |      334   |\r\n|  5 Tamarack            |    384  |     401 |     380 |      370   |\r\n|  6 Red pine            |    347  |     355 |     345 |      340   |\r\n|  7 White fir           |    346  |     381 |     322 |      334   |\r\n|  8 Western yellow pine |    328  |     334 |     307 |      342   |\r\n|  9 Lodgepole pine      |    318  |     316 |     318 |      319   |\r\n| 10 White pine          |    299  |     304 |     294 |      299   |\r\n| 11 Engelmann pine      |    266  |     272 |     253 |      274   |\r\n| 12 Alpine fir          |    241  |     284 |     203 |      235   |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| NOTE.--Black locust and hickory are not included in this table,   |\r\n| but their position would be near the head of the list.            |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n\r\nTests for either form of hardness are of comparative value only.\r\nTests for indentation are commonly made by penetrations of the\r\nmaterial with a steel punch or ball.[16] Tests for abrasion are\r\nmade by wearing down wood with sandpaper or by means of a sand\r\nblast.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: See articles by Gabriel Janka listed in\r\nbibliography, pages 151-152.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEAVABILITY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cleavability_ is the term used to denote the facility with\r\nwhich wood is split. A splitting stress is one in which the\r\nforces act normally like a wedge. (See Fig. 21.) The plane of\r\ncleavage is parallel to the grain, either radially or\r\ntangentially.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Cleavage of highly elastic wood. The\r\ncleft runs far ahead of the wedge.]\r\n\r\nThis property of wood is very important in certain uses such as\r\nfirewood, fence rails, billets, and squares. Resistance to\r\nsplitting or low cleavability is desirable where wood must hold\r\nnails or screws, as in box-making. Wood usually splits more\r\nreadily along the radius than parallel to the growth rings\r\nthough exceptions occur, as in the case of cross grain.\r\n\r\nSplitting involves transverse tension, but only a portion of the\r\nfibres are under stress at a time. A wood of little stiffness\r\nand strong cohesion across the grain is difficult to split,\r\nwhile one with great stiffness, such as longleaf pine, is easily\r\nsplit. The form of the grain and the presence of knots greatly\r\naffect this quality.\r\n\r\n|---------------------------------------------|\r\n|                 TABLE XIII                  |\r\n|---------------------------------------------|\r\n| CLEAVAGE STRENGTH OF SMALL CLEAR PIECES OF  |\r\n|         32 WOODS IN GREEN CONDITION         |\r\n|          (Forest Service Cir. 213)          |\r\n|---------------------------------------------|\r\n|                   |    When    |    When    |\r\n|   COMMON NAME     | surface of | surface of |\r\n|   OF SPECIES      | failure is | failure is |\r\n|                   |   radial   | tangential |\r\n|-------------------+------------+------------|\r\n|                   |  Lbs. per  |  Lbs. per  |\r\n|                   |  sq. inch  |  sq. inch  |\r\n|                   |            |            |\r\n|    Hardwoods      |            |            |\r\n|                   |            |            |\r\n| Ash, black        |     275    |     260    |\r\n|   white           |     333    |     346    |\r\n| Bashwood          |     130    |     168    |\r\n| Beech             |     339    |     527    |\r\n| Birch, yellow     |     294    |     287    |\r\n| Elm, slippery     |     401    |     424    |\r\n|   white           |     210    |     270    |\r\n| Hackberry         |     422    |     436    |\r\n| Locust, honey     |     552    |     610    |\r\n| Maple, red        |     297    |     330    |\r\n|   sugar           |     376    |     513    |\r\n| Oak, post         |     354    |     487    |\r\n|   red             |     380    |     470    |\r\n|   swamp white     |     428    |     536    |\r\n|   white           |     382    |     457    |\r\n|   yellow          |     379    |     470    |\r\n| Sycamore          |     265    |     425    |\r\n| Tupelo            |     277    |     380    |\r\n|                   |            |            |\r\n|    Conifers       |            |            |\r\n|                   |            |            |\r\n| Arborvitæ         |     148    |     139    |\r\n| Cypress, bald     |     167    |     154    |\r\n| Fir, alpine       |     130    |     133    |\r\n|   Douglas         |     139    |     127    |\r\n|   white           |     145    |     187    |\r\n| Hemlock           |     168    |     151    |\r\n| Pine, lodgepole   |     142    |     140    |\r\n|   longleaf        |     187    |     180    |\r\n|   red             |     161    |     154    |\r\n|   sugar           |     168    |     189    |\r\n|   western yellow  |     162    |     187    |\r\n|   white           |     144    |     160    |\r\n| Spruce, Engelmann |     110    |     135    |\r\n| Tamarack          |     167    |     159    |\r\n|---------------------------------------------|\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II FACTORS  AFFECTING THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF WOOD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWood is an organic product--a structure of infinite variation of\r\ndetail and design.[17] It is on this account that no two woods\r\nare alike--in reality no two specimens from the same log are\r\nidentical. There are certain properties that characterize each\r\nspecies, but they are subject to considerable variation. Oak,\r\nfor example, is considered hard, heavy, and strong, but some\r\npieces, even of the same species of oak, are much harder,\r\nheavier, and stronger than others. With hickory are associated\r\nthe properties of great strength, toughness, and resilience, but\r\nsome pieces are comparatively weak and brash and ill-suited for\r\nthe exacting demands for which good hickory is peculiarly\r\nadapted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: For details regarding the structure of wood see\r\nRecord, Samuel J.: Identification of the economic woods of the\r\nUnited States. New York, John Wiley & Sons, 1912.]\r\n\r\nIt follows that no definite value can be assigned to the\r\nproperties of any wood and that tables giving average results of\r\ntests may not be directly applicable to any individual stick.\r\nWith sufficient knowledge of the intrinsic factors affecting the\r\nresults it becomes possible to infer from the appearance of\r\nmaterial its probable variation from the average. As yet too\r\nlittle is known of the relation of structure and chemical\r\ncomposition to the mechanical and physical properties to permit\r\nmore than general conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRATE OF GROWTH\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand the effect of variations in the rate of growth it\r\nis first necessary to know how wood is formed. A tree increases\r\nin diameter by the formation, between the old wood and the inner\r\nbark, of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem, living\r\nbranches, and roots. Under ordinary conditions one layer is\r\nformed each year and in cross section as on the end of a log\r\nthey appear as rings--often spoken of as _annual rings_. These\r\ngrowth layers are made up of wood cells of various kinds, but\r\nfor the most part fibrous. In timbers like pine, spruce,\r\nhemlock, and other coniferous or softwood species the wood cells\r\nare mostly of one kind, and as a result the material is much\r\nmore uniform in structure than that of most hardwoods. (See\r\nFrontispiece.) There are no vessels or pores in coniferous wood\r\nsuch as one sees so prominently in oak and ash, for example.\r\n(See Fig. 22.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Cross sections of a ring-porous\r\nhardwood (white ash), a diffuse-porous hardwood (red gum), and a\r\nnon-porous or coniferous wood (eastern hemlock). X 30.\r\n_Photomicrographs by the author._]\r\n\r\nThe structure of the hardwoods is more complex. They are more or\r\nless filled with vessels, in some cases (oak, chestnut, ash)\r\nquite large and distinct, in others (buckeye, poplar, gum) too\r\nsmall to be seen plainly without a small hand lens. In\r\ndiscussing such woods it is customary to divide them into two\r\nlarge classes--_ring-porous_ and _diffuse-porous_. (See Fig.\r\n22.) In ring-porous species, such as oak, chestnut, ash, black\r\nlocust, catalpa, mulberry, hickory, and elm, the larger vessels\r\nor pores (as cross sections of vessels are called) become\r\nlocalized in one part of the growth ring, thus forming a region\r\nof more or less open and porous tissue. The rest of the ring is\r\nmade up of smaller vessels and a much greater proportion of wood\r\nfibres. These fibres are the elements which give strength and\r\ntoughness to wood, while the vessels are a source of weakness.\r\n\r\nIn diffuse-porous woods the pores are scattered throughout the\r\ngrowth ring instead of being collected in a band or row.\r\nExamples of this kind of wood are gum, yellow poplar, birch,\r\nmaple, cottonwood, basswood, buckeye, and willow. Some species,\r\nsuch as walnut and cherry, are on the border between the two\r\nclasses, forming a sort of intermediate group.\r\n\r\nIf one examines the smoothly cut end of a stick of almost any\r\nkind of wood, he will note that each growth ring is made up of\r\ntwo more or less well-defined parts. That originally nearest the\r\ncentre of the tree is more open textured and almost invariably\r\nlighter in color than that near the outer portion of the ring.\r\nThe inner portion was formed early in the season, when growth\r\nwas comparatively rapid and is known as _early wood_ (also\r\nspring wood); the outer portion is the _late wood_, being\r\nproduced in the summer or early fall. In soft pines there is not\r\nmuch contrast in the different parts of the ring, and as a\r\nresult the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work.\r\nIn hard pine, on the other hand, the late wood is very dense and\r\nis deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft,\r\nstraw-colored early wood. (See Fig. 23.) In ring-porous woods\r\neach season's growth is always well defined, because the large\r\npores of the spring abut on the denser tissue of the fall\r\nbefore. In the diffuse-porous, the demarcation between rings is\r\nnot always so clear and in not a few cases is almost, if not\r\nentirely, invisible to the unaided eye. (See Fig. 22.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Cross section of longleaf pine showing\r\nseveral growth rings with variations in the width of the\r\ndark-colored late wood. Seven resin ducts are visible. X 33.\r\n_Photomicrograph by U.S. Forest Service_]\r\n\r\nIf one compares a heavy piece of pine with a light specimen it\r\nwill be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger\r\nproportion of late wood than the other, and is therefore\r\nconsiderably darker. The late wood of all species is denser than\r\nthat formed early in the season, hence the greater the\r\nproportion of late wood the greater the density and strength.\r\nWhen examined under a microscope the cells of the late wood are\r\nseen to be very thick-walled and with very small cavities, while\r\nthose formed first in the season have thin walls and large\r\ncavities. The strength is in the walls, not the cavities. In\r\nchoosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the\r\nimportant consideration, the principal thing to observe is the\r\ncomparative amounts of early and late wood. The width of ring,\r\nthat is, the number per inch, is not nearly so important as the\r\nproportion of the late wood in the ring.\r\n\r\nIt is not only the proportion of late wood, but also its\r\nquality, that counts. In specimens that show a very large\r\nproportion of late wood it may be noticeably more porous and\r\nweigh considerably less than the late wood in pieces that\r\ncontain but little. One can judge comparative density, and\r\ntherefore to some extent weight and strength, by visual\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of the U.S. Forest Service regarding the effect\r\nof rate of growth on the properties of Douglas fir are\r\nsummarized as follows:\r\n\r\n\"1. In general, rapidly grown wood (less than eight rings per\r\ninch) is relatively weak. A study of the individual tests upon\r\nwhich the average points are based shows, however, that when it\r\nis not associated with light weight and a small proportion of\r\nsummer wood, rapid growth is not indicative of weak wood.\r\n\r\n\"2. An average rate of growth, indicated by from 12 to 16 rings\r\nper inch, seems to produce the best material.\r\n\r\n\"3. In rates of growths lower than 16 rings per inch, the\r\naverage strength of the material decreases, apparently\r\napproaching a uniform condition above 24 rings per inch. In such\r\nslow rates of growth the texture of the wood is very uniform,\r\nand naturally there is little variation in weight or strength.\r\n\r\n\"An analysis of tests on large beams was made to ascertain if\r\naverage rate of growth has any relation to the mechanical\r\nproperties of the beams. The analysis indicated conclusively\r\nthat there was no such relation. Average rate of growth [without\r\nconsideration also of density], therefore, has little\r\nsignificance in grading structural timber.\"[18] This is because\r\nof the wide variation in the percentage of late wood in\r\ndifferent parts of the cross section.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Bul. 88: Properties and uses of Douglas fir, p.\r\n29.]\r\n\r\nExperiments seem to indicate that for most species there is a\r\nrate of growth which, in general, is associated with the\r\ngreatest strength, especially in small specimens. For eight\r\nconifers it is as follows:[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Bul. 108, U. S. Forest Service: Tests of\r\nstructural timbers, p. 37.]\r\n\r\n                  Rings per inch\r\nDouglas fir             24\r\nShortleaf pine          12\r\nLoblolly pine            6\r\nWestern larch           18\r\nWestern hemlock         14\r\nTamarack                20\r\nNorway pine             18\r\nRedwood                 30\r\n\r\nNo satisfactory explanation can as yet be given for the real\r\ncauses underlying the formation of early and late wood. Several\r\nfactors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth\r\nalone does not determine the proportion of the two portions of\r\nthe ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard\r\nand heavy, while in others the opposite is true. The quality of\r\nthe site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character\r\nof the wood formed, though it is not possible to formulate a\r\nrule governing it. In general, however, it may be said that\r\nwhere strength or ease of working is essential, woods of\r\nmoderate to slow growth should be chosen. But in choosing a\r\nparticular specimen it is not the width of ring, but the\r\nproportion and character of the late wood which should govern.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the ring-porous hardwoods there seems to exist a\r\npretty definite relation between the rate of growth of timber\r\nand its properties. This may be briefly summed up in the general\r\nstatement that the more rapid the growth or the wider the rings\r\nof growth, the heavier, harder, stronger, and stiffer the wood.\r\nThis, it must be remembered, applies only to ring-porous woods\r\nsuch as oak, ash, hickory, and others of the same group, and is,\r\nof course, subject to some exceptions and limitations.\r\n\r\nIn ring-porous woods of good growth it is usually the middle\r\nportion of the ring in which the thick-walled, strength-giving\r\nfibres are most abundant. As the breadth of ring diminishes,\r\nthis middle portion is reduced so that very slow growth produces\r\ncomparatively light, porous wood composed of thin-walled vessels\r\nand wood parenchyma. In good oak these large vessels of the\r\nearly wood occupy from 6 to 10 per cent of the volume of the\r\nlog, while in inferior material they may make up 25 per cent or\r\nmore. The late wood of good oak, except for radial grayish\r\npatches of small pores, is dark colored and firm, and consists\r\nof thick-walled fibres which form one-half or more of the wood.\r\nIn inferior oak, such fibre areas are much reduced both in\r\nquantity and quality. Such variation is very largely the result\r\nof rate of growth.\r\n\r\nWide-ringed wood is often called \"second-growth,\" because the\r\ngrowth of the young timber in open stands after the old trees\r\nhave been removed is more rapid than in trees in the forest, and\r\nin the manufacture of articles where strength is an important\r\nconsideration such \"second-growth\" hardwood material is\r\npreferred. This is particularly the case in the choice of\r\nhickory for handles and spokes. Here not only strength, but\r\ntoughness and resilience are important. The results of a series\r\nof tests on hickory by the U.S. Forest Service show that \"the\r\nwork or shock-resisting ability is greatest in wide-ringed wood\r\nthat has from 5 to 14 rings per inch, is fairly constant from 14\r\nto 38 rings, and decreases rapidly from 38 to 47 rings. The\r\nstrength at maximum load is not so great with the most\r\nrapid-growing wood; it is maximum with from 14 to 20 rings per\r\ninch, and again becomes less as the wood becomes more closely\r\nringed. The natural deduction is that wood of first-class\r\nmechanical value shows from 5 to 20 rings per inch and that\r\nslower growth yields poorer stock. Thus the inspector or buyer\r\nof hickory should discriminate against timber that has more than\r\n20 rings per inch. Exceptions exist, however, in the case of\r\nnormal growth upon dry situations, in which the slow-growing\r\nmaterial may be strong and tough.\"[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Bul. 80: The commercial hickories, pp. 48-50.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of rate of growth on the qualities of chestnut wood\r\nis summarized by the same authority as follows: \"When the rings\r\nare wide, the transition from spring wood to summer wood is\r\ngradual, while in the narrow rings the spring wood passes into\r\nsummer wood abruptly. The width of the spring wood changes but\r\nlittle with the width of the annual ring, so that the narrowing\r\nor broadening of the annual ring is always at the expense of the\r\nsummer wood. The narrow vessels of the summer wood make it\r\nricher in wood substance than the spring wood composed of wide\r\nvessels. Therefore, rapid-growing specimens with wide rings have\r\nmore wood substance than slow-growing trees with narrow rings.\r\nSince the more the wood substance the greater the weight, and\r\nthe greater the weight the stronger the wood, chestnuts with\r\nwide rings must have stronger wood than chestnuts with narrow\r\nrings. This agrees with the accepted view that sprouts (which\r\nalways have wide rings) yield better and stronger wood than\r\nseedling chestnuts, which grow more slowly in diameter.\"[21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Bul. 53: Chestnut in southern Maryland, pp.\r\n20-21.]\r\n\r\nIn diffuse-porous woods, as has been stated, the vessels or\r\npores are scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in\r\nthe early wood. The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, not\r\nthe same as in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly\r\nthe conditions in the conifers. In general it may be stated that\r\nsuch woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when\r\nvery rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood,\r\nstrength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is\r\nprized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of\r\ntexture and straightness of grain, which will in most cases\r\noccur when there is little contrast between the late wood of one\r\nseason's growth and the early wood of the next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARTWOOD AND SAPWOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nExamination of the end of a log of many species reveals a\r\ndarker-colored inner portion--the _heartwood_, surrounded by a\r\nlighter-colored zone--the _sapwood_. In some instances this\r\ndistinction in color is very marked; in others, the contrast is\r\nslight, so that it is not always easy to tell where one leaves\r\noff and the other begins. The color of fresh sapwood is always\r\nlight, sometimes pure white, but more often with a decided tinge\r\nof green or brown.\r\n\r\nSapwood is comparatively new wood. There is a time in the early\r\nhistory of every tree when its wood is all sapwood. Its\r\nprincipal functions are to conduct water from the roots to the\r\nleaves and to store up and give back according to the season the\r\nfood prepared in the leaves. The more leaves a tree bears and\r\nthe more thrifty its growth, the larger the volume of sapwood\r\nrequired, hence trees making rapid growth in the open have\r\nthicker sapwood for their size than trees of the same species\r\ngrowing in dense forests. Sometimes trees grown in the open may\r\nbecome of considerable size, a foot or more in diameter, before\r\nany heartwood begins to form, for example, in second-growth\r\nhickory, or field-grown white and loblolly pines.\r\n\r\nAs a tree increases in age and diameter an inner portion of the\r\nsapwood becomes inactive and finally ceases to function. This\r\ninert or dead portion is called heartwood, deriving its name\r\nsolely from its position and not from any vital importance to\r\nthe tree, as is shown by the fact that a tree can thrive with\r\nits heart completely decayed. Some, species begin to form\r\nheartwood very early in life, while in others the change comes\r\nslowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such trees as\r\nchestnut, black locust, mulberry, Osage orange, and sassafras,\r\nwhile in maple, ash, gum, hickory, hackberry, beech, and\r\nloblolly pine, thick sapwood is the rule.\r\n\r\nThere is no definite relation between the annual rings of growth\r\nand the amount of sapwood. Within the same species the\r\ncross-sectional area of the sapwood is roughly proportional to\r\nthe size of the crown of the tree. If the rings are narrow, more\r\nof them are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets\r\nlarger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase\r\nmaterially in volume. Sapwood is thicker in the upper portion of\r\nthe trunk of a tree than near the base, because the age and the\r\ndiameter of the upper sections are less.\r\n\r\nWhen a tree is very young it is covered with limbs almost, if\r\nnot entirely, to the ground, but as it grows older some or all\r\nof them will eventually die and be broken off. Subsequent growth\r\nof wood may completely conceal the stubs which, however, will\r\nremain as knots. No matter how smooth and clear a log is on the\r\noutside, it is more or less knotty near the middle. Consequently\r\nthe sapwood of an old tree, and particularly of a forest-grown\r\ntree, will be freer from knots than the heartwood. Since in most\r\nuses of wood, knots are defects that weaken the timber and\r\ninterfere with its ease of working and other properties, it\r\nfollows that sapwood, because of its position in the tree, may\r\nhave certain advantages over heartwood.\r\n\r\nIt is really remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees\r\nremains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is\r\nhundreds of years, and in a few instances thousands of years,\r\nold. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire,\r\ninsects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay,\r\nwhich, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk.\r\nThe larvæ of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels\r\nremain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages,\r\nhowever, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely\r\nto its relative age and position.\r\n\r\nIf a tree grows all its life in the open and the conditions of\r\nsoil and site remain unchanged, it will make its most rapid\r\ngrowth in youth, and gradually decline. The annual rings of\r\ngrowth are for many years quite wide, but later they become\r\nnarrower and narrower. Since each succeeding ring is laid down\r\non the outside of the wood previously formed, it follows that\r\nunless a tree materially increases its production of wood from\r\nyear to year, the rings must necessarily become thinner. As a\r\ntree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual\r\nwood production is lessened, thereby reducing still more the\r\nwidth of the growth rings. In the case of forest-grown trees so\r\nmuch depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle\r\nfor light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth\r\nmay alternate. Some trees, such as southern oaks, maintain the\r\nsame width of ring for hundreds of years. Upon the whole,\r\nhowever, as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the\r\ngrowth rings decreases.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that there may be decided differences in the grain\r\nof heartwood and sapwood cut from a large tree, particularly one\r\nthat is overmature. The relationship between width of growth\r\nrings and the mechanical properties of wood is discussed under\r\nRate of Growth. In this connection, however, it may be stated\r\nthat as a general rule the wood laid on late in the life of a\r\ntree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than\r\nthat produced earlier. It follows that in a large log the\r\nsapwood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was\r\ngrown, may be inferior in hardness, strength, and toughness to\r\nequally sound heartwood from the same log.\r\n\r\nAfter exhaustive tests on a number of different woods the U.S.\r\nForest Service concludes as follows: \"Sapwood, except that from\r\nold, overmature trees, is as strong as heartwood, other things\r\nbeing equal, and so far as the mechanical properties go should\r\nnot be regarded as a defect.\"[22] Careful inspection of the\r\nindividual tests made in the investigation fails to reveal any\r\nrelation between the proportion of sapwood and the breaking\r\nstrength of timber.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Bul. 108: Tests of structural timber, p. 35.]\r\n\r\nIn the study of the hickories the conclusion was: \"There is an\r\nunfounded prejudice against the heartwood. Specifications place\r\nwhite hickory, or sapwood, in a higher grade than red hickory,\r\nor heartwood, though there is no inherent difference in\r\nstrength. In fact, in the case of large and old hickory trees,\r\nthe sapwood nearest the bark is comparatively weak, and the best\r\nwood is in the heart, though in young trees of thrifty growth\r\nthe best wood is in the sap.\"[23] The results of tests from\r\nselected pieces lying side by side in the same tree, and also\r\nthe average values for heartwood and sapwood in shipments of the\r\ncommercial hickories without selection, show conclusively that\r\n\"the transformation of sapwood into heartwood does not affect\r\neither the strength or toughness of the wood.... It is true,\r\nhowever, that sapwood is usually more free from latent defects\r\nthan heartwood.\"[24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Bul. 80: The commercial hickories, p. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nSpecifications for paving blocks often require that longleaf\r\npine be 90 per cent heart. This is on the belief that sapwood is\r\nnot only more subject to decay, but is also weaker than\r\nheartwood. In reality there is no sound basis for discrimination\r\nagainst sapwood on account of strength, provided other\r\nconditions are equal. It is true that sapwood will not resist\r\ndecay as long as heartwood, if both are untreated with\r\npreservatives. It is especially so of woods with deep-colored\r\nheartwood, and is due to infiltrations of tannins, oils, and\r\nresins, which make the wood more or less obnoxious to\r\ndecay-producing fungi. If, however, the timbers are to be\r\ntreated, sapwood is not a defect; in fact, because of the\r\nrelative ease with which it can be impregnated with\r\npreservatives it may be made more desirable than heartwood.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Although the factor of heart or sapwood does not\r\ninfluence the mechanical properties of the wood and there is\r\nusually no difference in structure observable under the\r\nmicroscope, nevertheless sapwood is generally decidedly\r\ndifferent from heartwood in its physical properties. It dries\r\nbetter and more easily than heartwood, usually with less\r\nshrinkage and little checking or honeycombing. This is\r\nespecially the case with the more refractory woods, such as\r\nwhite oaks and _Eucalyptus globulus_ and _viminalis_. It is\r\nusually much more permeable to air, even in green wood, notably\r\nso in loblolly pine and even in white oak. As already stated, it\r\nis much more subject to decay. The sapwood of white oak may be\r\nimpregnated with creosote with comparative ease, while the\r\nheartwood is practically impenetrable. These facts indicate a\r\ndifference in its chemical nature.--H.D. Tiemann.]\r\n\r\nIn specifications for structural timbers reference is sometimes\r\nmade to \"boxheart,\" meaning the inclusion of the pith or centre\r\nof the tree within a cross section of the timber. From numerous\r\nexperiments it appears that the position of the pith does not\r\nbear any relation to the strength of the material. Since most\r\nseason checks, however, are radial, the position of the pith may\r\ninfluence the resistance of a seasoned beam to horizontal shear,\r\nbeing greatest when the pith is located in the middle half of\r\nthe section.[26]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Bul. 108, U.S. Forest Service, p. 36.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHT, DENSITY, AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom data obtained from a large number of tests on the strength\r\nof different woods it appears that, other things being equal,\r\nthe crushing strength parallel to the grain, fibre stress at\r\nelastic limit in bending, and shearing strength along the grain\r\nof wood vary in direct proportion to the weight of dry wood per\r\nunit of volume when green. Other strength values follow\r\ndifferent laws. The hardness varies in a slightly greater ratio\r\nthan the square of the density. The work to the breaking point\r\nincreases even more rapidly than the cube of density. The\r\nmodulus of rupture in bending lies between the first power and\r\nthe square of the density. This, of course, is true only in case\r\nthe greater weight is due to increase in the amount of wood\r\nsubstance. A wood heavy with resin or other infiltrated\r\nsubstance is not necessarily stronger than a similar specimen\r\nfree from such materials. If differences in weight are due to\r\ndegree of seasoning, in other words, to the relative amounts of\r\nwater contained, the rules given above will of course not hold,\r\nsince strength increases with dryness. But of given specimens of\r\npine or of oak, for example, in the green condition, the\r\ncomparative strength may be inferred from the weight. It is not\r\npermissible, however, to compare such widely different woods as\r\noak and pine on a basis of their weights.[27]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The oaks for some unknown reason fall below the\r\nnormal strength for weight, whereas the hickories rise above.\r\nCertain other woods also are somewhat exceptional to the normal\r\nrelation of strength and density.]\r\n\r\nThe weight of wood substance, that is, the material which\r\ncomposes the walls of the fibres and other cells, is practically\r\nthe same in all species, whether pine, hickory, or cottonwood,\r\nbeing a little greater than half again as heavy as water. It\r\nvaries slightly from beech sapwood, 1.50, to Douglas fir\r\nheartwood, 1.57, averaging about 1.55 at 30° to 35° C., in terms\r\nof water at its greatest density 4° C. The reason any wood\r\nfloats is that the air imprisoned in its cavities buoys it up.\r\nWhen this is displaced by water the wood becomes water-logged\r\nand sinks. Leaving out of consideration infiltrated substances,\r\nthe reason a cubic foot of one kind of dry wood is heavier than\r\nthat of another is because it contains a greater amount of wood\r\nsubstance.  ~Density~ is merely the weight of a unit of volume,\r\nas 35 pounds per cubic foot, or 0.56 grams per cubic centimetre.\r\n~Specific gravity~ or relative density is the ratio of the\r\ndensity of any material to the density of distilled water at 4°\r\nC. (39.2° F.). A cubic foot of distilled water at 4° C. weighs\r\n62.43 pounds. Hence the specific gravity of a piece of wood with\r\na density of 35 pounds is 35 / 62.43 = 0.561. To find the weight\r\nper cubic foot when the specific gravity is given, simply\r\nmultiply by 62.43. Thus, 0.561 X 62.43 = 35. In the metric\r\nsystem, since the weight of a cubic centimetre of pure water is\r\none gram, the density in grams per cubic centimetre has the same\r\nnumerical value as the specific gravity.\r\n\r\nSince the amount of water in wood is extremely variable it\r\nusually is not satisfactory to refer to the density of green\r\nwood. For scientific purposes the density of \"oven-dry\" wood is\r\nused; that is, the wood is dried in an oven at a temperature of\r\n100°C. (212°F.) until a constant weight is attained. For\r\ncommercial purposes the weight or density of air-dry or\r\n\"shipping-dry\" wood is used. This is usually expressed in pounds\r\nper thousand board feet, a board foot being considered as\r\none-twelfth of a cubic foot.\r\n\r\nWood shrinks greatly in drying from the green to the oven-dry\r\ncondition. (See Table XIV.) Consequently a block of wood\r\nmeasuring a cubic foot when green will measure considerably less\r\nwhen oven-dry. It follows that the density of oven-dry wood does\r\nnot represent the weight of the dry wood substance in a cubic\r\nfoot of green wood. In other words, it is not the weight of a\r\ncubic foot of green wood minus the weight of the water which it\r\ncontains. Since the latter is often a more convenient figure to\r\nuse and much easier to obtain than the weight of oven-dry wood,\r\nit is commonly expressed in tables of \"specific gravity or\r\ndensity of dry wood.\"\r\n\r\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                                 TABLE XIV

It is purely a fictitious quantity. To convert\r\nthis figure into actual density or specific gravity of the dry\r\nwood, it is necessary to know the amount of shrinkage in volume.\r\nIf S is the percentage of shrinkage from the green to the\r\noven-dry condition, based on the green volume; D, the density of\r\nthe dry wood per cubic foot while green; and d the actual\r\n                                   D\r\ndensity of oven-dry wood, then ---------- = d.\r\n                                1 - .0 S\r\n\r\nThis relation becomes clearer from the following analysis:\r\nTaking V and W as the volume and weight, respectively, when\r\ngreen, and v and w as the corresponding volume and weight when\r\n                     w         W         V - v\r\noven-dry, then, d = --- ; D = --- ; S = ------- X 100, and\r\n                     v         V           V\r\n     V - v\r\ns = ------- X 100, in which S is the percentage of shrinkage\r\n       v\r\nfrom the green to the oven-dry condition, based on the green\r\nvolume, and s the same based on the oven-dry volume.\r\n\r\nIn tables of specific gravity or density of wood it should\r\nalways be stated whether the dry weight per unit of volume when\r\ngreen or the dry weight per unit of volume when dry is intended,\r\nsince the shrinkage in volume may vary from 6 to 50 per cent,\r\nthough in conifers it is usually about 10 per cent, and in\r\nhardwoods nearer 15 per cent. (See Table XIV.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn species which show a distinct difference between heartwood\r\nand sapwood the natural color of heartwood is invariably darker\r\nthan that of the sapwood, and very frequently the contrast is\r\nconspicuous. This is produced by deposits in the heartwood of\r\nvarious materials resulting from the process of growth,\r\nincreased possibly by oxidation and other chemical changes,\r\nwhich usually have little or no appreciable effect on the\r\nmechanical properties of the wood. (See HEARTWOOD AND SAPWOOD,\r\nabove.) Some experiments[28] on very resinous longleaf pine\r\nspecimens, however, indicate an increase in strength. This is\r\ndue to the resin which increases the strength when dry. Spruce\r\nimpregnated with crude resin and dried is greatly increased in\r\nstrength thereby.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Bul. 70, U.S. Forest Service, p. 92; also p. 126,\r\nappendix.]\r\n\r\nSince the late wood of a growth ring is usually darker in color\r\nthan the early wood, this fact may be used in judging the\r\ndensity, and therefore the hardness and strength of the\r\nmaterial. This is particularly the case with coniferous woods.\r\nIn ring-porous woods the vessels of the early wood not\r\ninfrequently appear on a finished surface as darker than the\r\ndenser late wood, though on cross sections of heartwood the\r\nreverse is commonly true. Except in the manner just stated the\r\ncolor of wood is no indication of strength.\r\n\r\nAbnormal discoloration of wood often denotes a diseased\r\ncondition, indicating unsoundness. The black check in western\r\nhemlock is the result of insect attacks.[29] The reddish-brown\r\nstreaks so common in hickory and certain other woods are mostly\r\nthe result of injury by birds.[30] The discoloration is merely\r\nan indication of an injury, and in all probability does not of\r\nitself affect the properties of the wood. Certain rot-producing\r\nfungi impart to wood characteristic colors which thus become\r\ncriterions of weakness. Ordinary sap-staining is due to fungous\r\ngrowth, but does not necessarily produce a weakening effect.[31]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: See Burke, H.E.: Black check in western hemlock.\r\nCir. No. 61, U.S. Bu. Entomology, 1905.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: See McAtee, W.L.: Woodpeckers in relation to trees\r\nand wood products. Bul. No. 39, U.S. Biol.

One form of it\r\nis produced in lumber by the method of sawing and has no\r\nreference to the natural arrangement of the wood elements. Thus\r\nif the plane of the saw is not approximately parallel to the\r\naxis of the log the grain of the lumber cut is not parallel to\r\nthe edges and is termed diagonal. This is likely to occur where\r\nthe logs have considerable taper, and in this case may be\r\nproduced if sawed parallel to the axis of growth instead of\r\nparallel to the growth rings.\r\n\r\nLumber and timber with diagonal grain is always weaker than\r\nstraight-grained material, the extent of the defect varying with\r\nthe degree of the angle the fibres make with the axis of the\r\nstick. In the vicinity of large knots the grain is likely to be\r\ncross. The defect is most serious where wood is subjected to\r\nflexure, as in beams.\r\n\r\n_Spiral grain_ is a very common defect in a tree, and when\r\nexcessive renders the timber valueless for use except in the\r\nround. It is produced by the arrangement of the wood fibres in a\r\nspiral direction about the axis instead of exactly vertical.\r\nTimber with spiral grain is also known as \"torse wood.\" Spiral\r\ngrain usually cannot be detected by casual inspection of a\r\nstick, since it does not show in the so-called visible grain of\r\nthe wood, by which is commonly meant a sectional view of the\r\nannual rings of growth cut longitudinally. It is accordingly\r\nvery easy to allow spiral-grained material to pass inspection,\r\nthereby introducing an element of weakness in a structure.\r\n\r\nThere are methods for readily detecting spiral grain. The\r\nsimplest is that of splitting a small piece radially. It is\r\nnecessary, of course, that the split be radial, that is, in a\r\nplane passing through the axis of the log, and not tangentially.\r\nIn the latter case it is quite probable that the wood would\r\nsplit straight, the line of cleavage being between the growth\r\nrings.\r\n\r\nIn inspection, the elements to examine are the rays. In the case\r\nof oak and certain other hardwoods these rays are so large that\r\nthey are readily seen not only on a radial surface, but on the\r\ntangential as well. On the former they appear as flakes, on the\r\nlatter as short lines. Since these rays are between the fibres\r\nit naturally follows that they will be vertical or inclined\r\naccording as the tree is straight-grained or spiral-grained.\r\nWhile they are not conspicuous in the softwoods, they can be\r\nseen upon close scrutiny, and particularly so if a small hand\r\nmagnifier is used.\r\n\r\nWhen wood has begun to dry and check it is very easy to see\r\nwhether or not it is straight- or spiral-grained, since the\r\nchecks will for the most part follow along the rays. If one\r\nexamines a row of telephone poles, for example, he will probably\r\nfind that most of them have checks running spirally around them.\r\nIf boards were sawed from such a pole after it was badly checked\r\nthey would fall to pieces of their own weight. The only way to\r\nget straight material would be to split it out.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that split billets and squares are\r\nstronger than most sawed material. The presence of the spiral\r\ngrain has little, if any, effect on the timber when it is used\r\nin the round, but in sawed material the greater the pitch of the\r\nspiral the greater is the defect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOTS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Knots_ are portions of branches included in the wood of the\r\nstem or larger branch. Branches originate as a rule from the\r\ncentral axis of a stem, and while living increase in size by the\r\naddition of annual woody layers which are a continuation of\r\nthose of the stem. The included portion is irregularly conical\r\nin shape with the tip at the pith. The direction of the fibre is\r\nat right angles or oblique to the grain of the stem, thus\r\nproducing local cross grain.\r\n\r\nDuring the development of a tree most of the limbs, especially\r\nthe lower ones, die, but persist for a time--often for years.\r\nSubsequent layers of growth of the stem are no longer intimately\r\njoined with the dead limb, but are laid around it. Hence dead\r\nbranches produce knots which are nothing more than pegs in a\r\nhole, and likely to drop out after the tree has been sawed into\r\nlumber. In grading lumber and structural timber, knots are\r\nclassified according to their form, size, soundness, and the\r\nfirmness with which they are held in place.[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: See Standard classification of structural timber.\r\nYearbook Am. Soc. for Testing Materials, 1913, pp. 300-303.\r\nContains three plates showing standard defects.]\r\n\r\nKnots materially affect checking and warping, ease in working,\r\nand cleavability of timber. They are defects which weaken timber\r\nand depreciate its value for structural purposes where strength\r\nis an important consideration. The weakening effect is much more\r\nserious where timber is subjected to bending and tension than\r\nwhere under compression. The extent to which knots affect the\r\nstrength of a beam depends upon their position, size, number,\r\ndirection of fibre, and condition. A knot on the upper side is\r\ncompressed, while one on the lower side is subjected to tension.\r\nThe knot, especially (as is often the case) if there is a season\r\ncheck in it, offers little resistance to this tensile stress.\r\nSmall, knots, however, may be so located in a beam along the\r\nneutral plane as actually to increase the strength by tending to\r\nprevent longitudinal shearing. Knots in a board or plank are\r\nleast injurious when they extend through it at right angles to\r\nits broadest surface. Knots which occur near the ends of a beam\r\ndo not weaken it. Sound knots which occur in the central portion\r\none-fourth the height of the beam from either edge are not\r\nserious defects.\r\n\r\nExtensive experiments by the U.S. Forest Service[33] indicate\r\nthe following effects of knots on structural timbers:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Bul. 108, pp. 52 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n(1) Knots do not materially influence the stiffness of\r\nstructural timber.\r\n\r\n(2) Only defects of the most serious character affect the\r\nelastic limit of beams. Stiffness and elastic strength are more\r\ndependent upon the quality of the wood fibre than upon defects\r\nin the beam.\r\n\r\n(3) The effect of knots is to reduce the difference between the\r\nfibre stress at elastic limit and the modulus of rupture of\r\nbeams. The breaking strength is very susceptible to defects.\r\n\r\n(4) Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression\r\nparallel to the grain.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Bul. 115, U.S. Forest Service: Mechanical\r\nproperties of western hemlock, p. 20.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROST SPLITS\r\n\r\n\r\nA common defect in standing timber results from radial splits\r\nwhich extend inward from the periphery of the tree, and almost,\r\nif not always, near the base. It is most common in trees which\r\nsplit readily, and those with large rays and thin bark. The\r\nprimary cause of the splitting is frost, and various theories\r\nhave been advanced to explain the action.\r\n\r\nR. Hartig[35] believes that freezing forces out a part of the\r\nimbibition water of the cell walls, thereby causing the wood to\r\nshrink, and if the interior layers have not yet been cooled,\r\ntangential strains arise which finally produce radial clefts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Hartig, R.: The diseases of trees (trans. by\r\nSomerville and Ward), London and New York, 1894, pp. 282-294.]\r\n\r\nAnother theory holds that the water is not driven out of the\r\ncell walls, but that difference in temperature conditions of\r\ninner and outer layers is itself sufficient to set up the\r\nstrains, resulting in splitting. An air temperature of 14°F. or\r\nless is considered necessary to produce frost splits.\r\n\r\nA still more recent theory is that of Busse[36] who considers\r\nthe mechanical action of the wind a very important factor. He\r\nobserved: (_a_) Frost splits sometimes occur at higher\r\ntemperatures than 14°F. (_b_) Most splits take place shortly\r\nbefore sunrise, _i.e._, at the time of lowest air and soil\r\ntemperature; they are never heard to take place at noon,\r\nafternoon, or evening. (_c_) They always occur between two roots\r\nor between the collars of two roots, (_d_) They are most\r\nfrequent in old, stout-rooted, broad-crowned trees; in younger\r\nstands it is always the stoutest members that are found with\r\nfrost splits, while in quite young stands they are altogether\r\nabsent, (_e_) Trees on wet sites are most liable to splits, due\r\nto difference in wood structure, just as difference in wood\r\nstructure makes different species vary in this regard. (_f_)\r\nFrost splits are most numerous less than three feet above the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Busse, W.: Frost-, Ring- und Kernrisse. Forstwiss.\r\nCentralb., XXXII, 2, 1910, pp. 74-81.]\r\n\r\nWhen a tree is swayed by the wind the roots are counteracting\r\nforces, and the wood fibres are tested in tension and\r\ncompression by the opposing forces; where the roots exercise\r\ntension stresses most effectively the effect of compression\r\nstresses is at a minimum; only where the pressure is in excess\r\nof the tension, _i.e._, between the roots, can a separation of\r\nthe fibre result. Hence, when by frost a tension on the entire\r\nperiphery is established, and the wind localizes additional\r\nstrains, failure occurs. The stronger the compression and\r\ntension, the severer the strains and the oftener failures occur.\r\nThe occurrence of reports of frost splits on wind-still days is\r\nbelieved by Busse to be due to the opening of old frost splits\r\nwhere the tension produced by the frost alone is sufficient.\r\n\r\nFrost splits may heal over temporarily, but usually open up\r\nagain during the following winter. The presence of old splits is\r\noften indicated by a ridge of callous, the result of the\r\ncambium's effort to occlude the wound. Frost splits not only\r\naffect the value of lumber, but also afford an entrance into the\r\nliving tree for disease and decay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAKES, GALLS, PITCH POCKETS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heart shake_ occurs in nearly all overmature timber, being more\r\nfrequent in hardwoods (especially oak) than in conifers. In\r\ntypical heart shake the centre of the hole shows indications of\r\nbecoming hollow and radial clefts of varying size extend outward\r\nfrom the pith, being widest inward. It frequently affects only\r\nthe butt log, but may extend to the entire hole and even the\r\nlarger branches. It usually results from a shrinkage of the\r\nheartwood due probably to chemical changes in the wood.\r\n\r\nWhen it consists of a single cleft extending across the pith it\r\nis termed _simple heart shake_. Shake of this character in\r\nstraight-grained trees affects only one or two central boards\r\nwhen cut into lumber, but in spiral-grained timber the damage is\r\nmuch greater. When shake consists of several radial clefts it is\r\ntermed _star shake_. In some instances one or more of these\r\nclefts may extend nearly to the bark. In felled or converted\r\ntimber clefts due to heart shake may be distinguished from\r\nseasoning cracks by the darker color of the exposed surfaces.\r\nSuch clefts, however, tend to open up more and more as the\r\ntimber seasons.\r\n\r\n_Cup_ or _ring shake_ results from the pulling apart of two or\r\nmore growth rings. It is one of the most serious defects to\r\nwhich sound timber is subject, as it seriously reduces the\r\ntechnical properties of wood. It is very common in sycamore and\r\nin western larch, particularly in the butt portion. Its\r\noccurrence is most frequent at the junction of two growth layers\r\nof very unequal thickness. Consequently it is likely to occur in\r\ntrees which have grown slowly for a time, then abruptly\r\nincreased, due to improved conditions of light and food, as in\r\nthinning. Old timber is more subject to it than young trees. The\r\ndamage is largely confined to the butt log. Cup shake is often\r\nassociated with other forms of shake, and not infrequently shows\r\ntraces of decay.\r\n\r\nThe causes of cup shake are uncertain. The swaying action of the\r\nwind may result in shearing apart the growth layers, especially\r\nin trees growing in exposed places. Frost may in some instances\r\nbe responsible for cup shake or at least a contributing factor,\r\nalthough trees growing in regions free from frost often have\r\nring shake. Shrinkage of the heartwood may be concentric as well\r\nas radial in its action, thus producing cup shake instead of, or\r\nin connection with, heart shake.\r\n\r\nA local defect somewhat similar in effect to cup shake is known\r\nas _rind gall_. If the cambium layer is exposed by the removal\r\nof the entire bark or rind it will die. Subsequent growth over\r\nthe damaged portion does not cohere with the wood previously\r\nformed by the old cambium. The defect resulting is termed rind\r\ngall. The most common causes of it are fire, gnawing, blazing,\r\nchipping, sun scald, lightning, and abrasions.\r\n\r\n_Heart break_ is a term applied to areas of compression failure\r\nalong the grain found in occasional logs. Sometimes these breaks\r\nare invisible until the wood is manufactured into the finished\r\narticle. The occurrence of this defect is mostly limited to the\r\ndense hardwoods, such as hickory and to heavy tropical species.\r\nIt is the source of considerable loss in the fancy veneer\r\nindustry, as the veneer from valuable logs so affected drops to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nThe cause of heart break is not positively known. It is highly\r\nprobable, however, that when the tree is felled the trunk\r\nstrikes across a rock or another log, and the impact causes\r\nactual failure in the log as in a beam.\r\n\r\n_Resin_ or _pitch pockets_ are of common occurrence in the wood\r\nof larch, spruce, fir, and especially of longleaf and other hard\r\npines. They are due to accumulations of resin in openings\r\nbetween adjacent layers of growth. They are more frequent in\r\ntrees growing alone than in those of dense stands. The pockets\r\nare usually a few inches in greatest dimension and affect only\r\none or two growth layers. They are hidden until exposed by the\r\nsaw, rendering it impossible to cut lumber with reference to\r\ntheir position. Often several boards are damaged by a single\r\npocket. In grading lumber, pitch pockets are classified as\r\nsmall, standard, and large, depending upon their width and\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECT INJURIES[37]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: For detailed information regarding insect\r\ninjuries, the reader is referred to the various publications of\r\nthe U.S. Bureau of Entomology, Washington, D.C.]\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of many insects are destructive to wood. Some attack\r\nthe wood of living trees, others only that of felled or\r\nconverted material. Every hole breaks the continuity of the\r\nfibres and impairs the strength, and if there are very many of\r\nthem the material may be ruined for all purposes where strength\r\nis required.\r\n\r\nSome of the most common insects attacking the wood of living\r\ntrees are the oak timber worm, the chestnut timber worm,\r\ncarpenter worms, ambrosia beetles, the locust borer, turpentine\r\nbeetles and turpentine borers, and the white pine weevil.\r\n\r\nThe insect injuries to forest products may be classed according\r\nto the stage of manufacture of the material. Thus round timber\r\nwith the bark on, such as poles, posts, mine props, and sawlogs,\r\nis subject to serious damage by the same class of insects as\r\nthose mentioned above, particularly by the round-headed borers,\r\ntimber worms, and ambrosia beetles. Manufactured unseasoned\r\nproducts are subject to damage from ambrosia beetles and other\r\nwood borers. Seasoned hardwood lumber of all kinds, rough\r\nhandles, wagon stock, etc., made partially or entirely of\r\nsapwood, are often reduced in value from 10 to 90 per cent by a\r\nclass of insects known as powder-post beetles. Finished hardwood\r\nproducts such as handles, wagon, carriage and machinery stock,\r\nespecially if ash or hickory, are often destroyed by the\r\npowder-post beetles. Construction timbers in buildings, bridges\r\nand trestles, cross-ties, poles, mine props, fence posts, etc.,\r\nare sometimes seriously injured by wood-boring larvæ, termites,\r\nblack ants, carpenter bees, and powder-post beetles, and\r\nsometimes reduced in value from 10 to 100 per cent. In tropical\r\ncountries termites are a very serious pest in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINE WOOD-BORER INJURIES\r\n\r\n\r\nVast amounts of timber used for piles in wharves and other\r\nmarine structures are constantly being destroyed or seriously\r\ninjured by marine borers. Almost invariably they are confined to\r\nsalt water, and all the woods commonly used for piling are\r\nsubject to their attacks. There are two genera of mollusks,\r\n_Xylotrya_ and _Teredo_, and three of crustaceans, _Limnoria,\r\nChelura_, and _Sphoeroma_, that do serious damage in many places\r\nalong both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.\r\n\r\nThese mollusks, which are popularly known as \"shipworms,\" are\r\nmuch alike in structure and mode of life. They attack the\r\nexposed surface of the wood and immediately begin to bore. The\r\ntunnels, often as large as a lead pencil, extend usually in a\r\nlongitudinal direction and follow a very irregular, tangled\r\ncourse. Hard woods are apparently penetrated as readily as soft\r\nwoods, though in the same timber the softer parts are preferred.\r\nThe food consists of infusoria and is not obtained from the wood\r\nsubstance. The sole object of boring into the wood is to obtain\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nAlthough shipworms can live in cold water they thrive best and\r\nare most destructive in warm water. The length of time required\r\nto destroy an average barked, unprotected pine pile on the\r\nAtlantic coast south from Chesapeake Bay and along the entire\r\nPacific coast varies from but one to three years.\r\n\r\nOf the crustacean borers, _Limnoria_, or the \"wood louse,\" is\r\nthe only one of great importance, although _Sphoeroma_ is\r\nreported destructive in places. _Limnoria_ is about the size of\r\na grain of rice and tunnels into the wood for both food and\r\nshelter. The galleries extend inward radially, side by side, in\r\ncountless numbers, to the depth of about one-half inch. The thin\r\nwood partitions remaining are destroyed by wave action, so that\r\na fresh surface is exposed to attack. Both hard and soft woods\r\nare damaged, but the rate is faster in the soft woods or softer\r\nportions of a wood.\r\n\r\nTimbers seriously attacked by marine borers are badly weakened\r\nor completely destroyed. If the original strength of the\r\nmaterial is to be preserved it is necessary to protect the wood\r\nfrom the borers. This is sometimes accomplished by proper\r\ninjection of creosote oil, and more or less successfully by the\r\nuse of various kinds of external coatings.[38] No treatment,\r\nhowever, has proved entirely satisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: See Smith, C. Stowell: Preservation of piling\r\nagainst marine wood borers. Cir. 128, U.S. Forest Service, 1908,\r\npp. 15.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNGOUS INJURIES[39]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: See Von Schrenck, H.: The decay of timber and\r\nmethods of preventing it.

London and New York, 1894.]\r\n\r\nFungi are responsible for almost all decay of wood. So far as\r\nknown, all decay is produced by living organisms, either fungi\r\nor bacteria. Some species attack living trees, sometimes killing\r\nthem, or making them hollow, or in the case of pecky cypress and\r\nincense cedar filling the wood with galleries like those of\r\nboring insects. A much larger variety work only in felled or\r\ndead wood, even after it is placed in buildings or manufactured\r\narticles. In any case the process of destruction is the same.\r\nThe mycelial threads penetrate the walls of the cells in search\r\nof food, which they find either in the cell contents (starches,\r\nsugars, etc.), or in the cell wall itself. The breaking down of\r\nthe cell walls through the chemical action of so-called\r\n\"enzymes\" secreted by the fungi follows, and the eventual\r\nproduct is a rotten, moist substance crumbling readily under the\r\nslightest pressure. Some species remove the ligneous matter and\r\nleave almost pure cellulose, which is white, like cotton; others\r\ndissolve the cellulose, leaving a brittle, dark brown mass of\r\nligno-cellulose. Fungi (such as the bluing fungus) which merely\r\nstain wood usually do not affect its mechanical properties\r\nunless the attacks are excessive.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that the action of rot-causing fungi is to\r\ndecrease the strength of wood, rendering it unsound, brittle,\r\nand dangerous to use. The most dangerous kinds are the so-called\r\n\"dry-rot\" fungi which work in many kinds of lumber after it is\r\nplaced in the buildings. They are particularly to be dreaded\r\nbecause unseen, working as they do within the walls or inside of\r\ncasings. Several serious wrecks of large buildings have been\r\nattributed to this cause. It is stated[40] that in the three\r\nyears (1911-1913) more than $100,000 was required to repair\r\ndamage due to dry rot.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Dry rot in factory timbers, by Inspection Dept.\r\nAssociated Factory Mutual Fire Insurance Cos., 31 Milk Street,\r\nBoston, 1913.]\r\n\r\nDry rot develops best at 75°F. and is said to be killed by a\r\ntemperature of 110°F.[41] Fully 70 per cent humidity is\r\nnecessary in the air in which a timber is surrounded for the\r\ngrowth of this fungus, and probably the wood must be quite near\r\nits fibre saturation condition. Nevertheless _Merulius\r\nlacrymans_ (one of the most important species) has been found to\r\nlive four years and eight months in a dry condition.[42]\r\nThorough kiln-drying will kill this fungus, but will not prevent\r\nits redevelopment. Antiseptic treatment, such as creosoting, is\r\nthe best prevention.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Falck, Richard: Die Meruliusfaüle des Bauholzes,\r\nHausschwammforschungen, 6. Heft., Jena, 1912.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Mez, Carl: Der Hausschwamm. Dresden, 1908, p. 63.]\r\n\r\nAll fungi require moisture and air[43] for their growth.\r\nDeprived of either of these the fungus dies or ceases to\r\ndevelop. Just what degree of moisture in wood is necessary for\r\nthe \"dry-rot\" fungus has not been determined, but it is\r\nevidently considerably above that of thoroughly air-dry timber,\r\nprobably more than 15 per cent moisture. Hence the importance of\r\nfree circulation of air about all timbers in a building.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: A culture of fungus placed in a glass jar and the\r\nair pumped out ceases to grow, but will start again as soon as\r\noxygen is admitted.]\r\n\r\nWarmth is also conducive to the growth of fungi, the most\r\nfavorable temperature being about 90°F. They cannot grow in\r\nextreme cold, although no degree of cold such as occurs\r\nnaturally will kill them. On the other hand, high temperature\r\nwill kill them, but the spores may survive even the boiling\r\ntemperature. Mould fungus has been observed to develop rapidly\r\nat 130°F. in a dry kiln in moist air, a condition under which an\r\nanimal cannot live more than a few minutes. This fungus was\r\nkilled, however, at about 140° or 145°F.[44]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Experiments in kiln-drying _Eucalyptus_ in\r\nBerkeley, U.S. Forest Service.]\r\n\r\nThe fungus (_Endothia parasitica_ And.) which causes the\r\nchestnut blight kills the trees by girdling them and has no\r\ndirect effect upon the wood save possibly the four or five\r\ngrowth rings of the sapwood.[45]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: See Anderson, Paul J.: The morphology and life\r\nhistory of the chestnut blight fungus.

U.S. Forest Service, Washington, 1914, pp. 54-58.]\r\n\r\nThe most common of the higher parasitic plants damaging timber\r\ntrees are mistletoes. Many species of deciduous trees are\r\nattacked by the common mistletoe (_Phoradendron flavescens_). It\r\nis very prevalent in the South and Southwest and when present in\r\nsufficient quantity does considerable damage. There is also a\r\nconsiderable number of smaller mistletoes belonging to the genus\r\n_Razoumofskya (Arceuthobium)_ which are widely distributed\r\nthroughout the country, and several of them are common on\r\nconiferous trees in the Rocky Mountains and along the Pacific\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nOne effect of the common mistletoe is the formation of large\r\nswellings or tumors. Often the entire tree may become stunted or\r\ndistorted. The western mistletoe is most common on the branches,\r\nwhere it produces \"witches' broom.\" It frequently attacks the\r\ntrunk as well, and boards cut from such trees are filled with\r\nlong, radial holes which seriously damage or destroy the value\r\nof the timber affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCALITY OF GROWTH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe data available regarding the effect of the locality of\r\ngrowth upon the properties of wood are not sufficient to warrant\r\ndefinite conclusions. The subject has, however, been kept in\r\nmind in many of the U.S. Forest Service timber tests and the\r\nfollowing quotations are assembled from various reports:\r\n\r\n\"In both the Cuban and longleaf pine the locality where grown\r\nappears to have but little influence on weight or strength, and\r\nthere is no reason to believe that the longleaf pine from one\r\nState is better than that from any other, since such variations\r\nas are claimed can be found on any 40-acre lot of timber in any\r\nState. But with loblolly and still more with shortleaf this\r\nseems not to be the case. Being widely distributed over many\r\nlocalities different in soil and climate, the growth of the\r\nshortleaf pine seems materially influenced by location. The wood\r\nfrom the southern coast and gulf region and even Arkansas is\r\ngenerally heavier than the wood from localities farther north.\r\nVery light and fine-grained wood is seldom met near the southern\r\nlimit of the range, while it is almost the rule in Missouri,\r\nwhere forms resembling the Norway pine are by no means rare. The\r\nloblolly, occupying both wet and dry soils, varies accordingly.\"\r\nCir. No. 12, p. 6.\r\n\r\n\" ... It is clear that as all localities have their heavy and\r\ntheir light timber, so they all share in strong and weak, hard\r\nand soft material, and the difference in quality of material is\r\nevidently far more a matter of individual variation than of soil\r\nor climate.\" _Ibid._, p.22\r\n\r\n\"A representative committee of the Carriage Builders'\r\nAssociation had publicly declared that this important industry\r\ncould not depend upon the supplies of southern timber, as the\r\noak grown in the South lacked the necessary qualities demanded\r\nin carriage construction. Without experiment this statement\r\ncould be little better than a guess, and was doubly unwarranted,\r\nsince it condemned an enormous amount of material, and one\r\nproduced under a great variety of conditions and by at least a\r\ndozen species of trees, involving, therefore, a complexity of\r\nproblems difficult enough for the careful investigator, and\r\nentirely beyond the few unsystematic observations of the members\r\nof a committee on a flying trip through one of the greatest\r\ntimber regions of the world.\r\n\r\n\"A number of samples were at once collected (part of them\r\nsupplied by the carriage builders' committee), and the fallacy\r\nof the broad statement mentioned was fully demonstrated by a\r\nshort series of tests and a more extensive study into structure\r\nand weight of these materials. From these tests it appears that\r\npieces of white oak from Arkansas excelled well-selected pieces\r\nfrom Connecticut, both in stiffness and endwise compression (the\r\ntwo most important forms of resistance).\" Report upon the\r\nforestry investigations of the U.S.D.A. 1877-1898, p. 331. See\r\nalso Rep. of Div. of For., 1890, p. 209.\r\n\r\n\"In some regions there are many small, stunted hickories, which\r\nmost users will not touch. They have narrow sap, are likely to\r\nbe birdpecked, and show very slow growth. Yet five of these\r\ntrees from a steep, dry south slope in West Virginia had an\r\naverage strength fully equal to that of the pignut from the\r\nbetter situation, and were superior in toughness, the work to\r\nmaximum load being 36.8 as against 31.2 for pignut. The trees\r\nhad about twice as many rings per inch as others from better\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\"This, however, is not very significant, as trees of the same\r\nspecies, age, and size, growing side by side under the same\r\nconditions of soil and situation, show great variation in their\r\ntechnical value. It is hard to account for this difference, but\r\nit seems that trees growing in wet or moist situations are\r\nrather inferior to those growing on fresher soil; also, it is\r\nclaimed by many hickory users that the wood from limestone soils\r\nis superior to that from sandy soils.\r\n\r\n\"One of the moot questions among hickory men is the relative\r\nvalue of northern and southern hickory. The impression prevails\r\nthat southern hickory is more porous and brash than hickory from\r\nthe north. The tests ... indicate that southern hickory is as\r\ntough and strong as northern hickory of the same age. But the\r\nsouthern hickories have a greater tendency to be shaky, and this\r\nresults in much waste. In trees from southern river bottoms the\r\nloss through shakes and grub-holes in many cases amounts to as\r\nmuch as 50 per cent.\r\n\r\n\"It is clear, therefore, that the difference in northern and\r\nsouthern hickory is not due to geographic location, but rather\r\nto the character of timber that is being cut. Nearly all of that\r\nfrom southern river bottoms and from the Cumberland Mountains is\r\nfrom large, old-growth trees; that from the north is from\r\nyounger trees which are grown under more favorable conditions,\r\nand it is due simply to the greater age of the southern trees\r\nthat hickory from that region is lighter and more brash than\r\nthat from the north.\" Bul. 80, pp. 52-55.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEASON OF CUTTING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that winter-felled timber has decided\r\nadvantages over that cut at other seasons of the year, and to\r\nthat cause alone are frequently ascribed much greater\r\ndurability, less liability to check and split, better color, and\r\neven increased strength and toughness. The conclusion from the\r\nvarious experiments made on the subject is that while the time\r\nof felling may, and often does, affect the properties of wood,\r\nsuch result is due to the weather conditions rather than to the\r\ncondition of the wood.\r\n\r\nThere are two phases of this question. One is concerned with the\r\nphysiological changes which might take place during the year in\r\nthe wood of a living tree. The other deals with the purely\r\nphysical results due to the weather, as differences in\r\ntemperature, humidity, moisture, and other features to be\r\nmentioned later.\r\n\r\nThose who adhere to the first view maintain that wood cut in\r\nsummer is quite different in composition from that cut in\r\nwinter. One opinion is that in summer the \"sap is up,\" while in\r\nwinter it is \"down,\" consequently winter-felled timber is drier.\r\nA variation of this belief is that in summer the sap contains\r\ncertain chemicals which affect the properties of wood and does\r\nnot contain them in winter. Again it is sometimes asserted that\r\nwood is actually denser in winter than in summer, as part of the\r\nwood substance is dissolved out in the spring and used for plant\r\nfood, being restored in the fall.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that such views could apply only to sapwood, since\r\nit alone is in living condition at the time of cutting.\r\nHeartwood is dead wood and has almost no function in the\r\nexistence of the tree other than the purely mechanical one of\r\nsupport. Heartwood does undergo changes, but they are gradual\r\nand almost entirely independent of the seasons.\r\n\r\nSapwood might reasonably be expected to respond to seasonal\r\nchanges, and to some extent it does. Just beneath the bark there\r\nis a thin layer of cells which during the growing season have\r\nnot attained their greatest density. With the exception of this\r\none annual ring, or portion of one, the density of the wood\r\nsubstance of the sapwood is nearly the same the year round.\r\nSlight variations may occur due to impregnation with sugar and\r\nstarch in the winter and its dissolution in the growing season.\r\nThe time of cutting can have no material effect on the inherent\r\nstrength and other mechanical properties of wood except in the\r\noutermost annual ring of growth.\r\n\r\nThe popular belief that sap is up in the spring and summer and\r\nis down in the winter has not been substantiated by experiment.\r\nThere are seasonal differences in the composition of sap, but so\r\nfar as the amount of sap in a tree is concerned there is fully\r\nas much, if not more, during the winter than in summer.\r\nWinter-cut wood is not drier, to begin with, than\r\nsummer-felled--in reality, it is likely to be wetter.[47]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: See Record, S.J.: Sap in relation to the\r\nproperties of wood. Proc. Am. Wood Preservers' Assn., Baltimore,\r\nMd., 1913, pp. 160-166.\r\n\r\nKempfer, Wm. H.: The air-seasoning of timber. In Bul. 161, Am.\r\nRy. Eng. Assn., 1913, p. 214.]\r\n\r\nThe important consideration in regard to this question is the\r\nseries of circumstances attending the handling of the timber\r\nafter it is felled. Wood dries more rapidly in summer than in\r\nwinter, not because there is less moisture at one time than\r\nanother, but because of the higher temperature in summer. This\r\ngreater heat is often accompanied by low humidity, and\r\nconditions are favorable for the rapid removal of moisture from\r\nthe exposed portions of wood. Wood dries by evaporation, and\r\nother things being equal, this will proceed much faster in hot\r\nweather than in cold.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of common observation that when wood dries it\r\nshrinks, and if shrinkage is not uniform in all directions the\r\nmaterial pulls apart, causing season checks. (See Fig. 27.) If\r\nevaporation proceeds more rapidly on the outside than inside,\r\nthe greater shrinkage of the outer portions is bound to result\r\nin many checks, the number and size increasing with the degree\r\nof inequality of drying.\r\n\r\nIn cold weather, drying proceeds slowly but uniformly, thus\r\nallowing the wood elements to adjust themselves with the least\r\namount of rupturing. In summer, drying proceeds rapidly and\r\nirregularly, so that material seasoned at that time is more\r\nlikely to split and check.\r\n\r\nThere is less danger of sap rot when trees are felled in winter\r\nbecause the fungus does not grow in the very cold weather, and\r\nthe lumber has a chance to season to below the danger point\r\nbefore the fungus gets a chance to attack it. If the logs in\r\neach case could be cut into lumber immediately after felling and\r\ngiven exactly the same treatment, for example, kiln-dried, no\r\ndifference due to the season of cutting would be noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER CONTENT[48]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48:  See Tiemann, H.D.: Effect of moisture upon the\r\nstrength and stiffness of wood. Bul. 70, U.S. Forest Service,\r\nWashington, D.C., 1906; also Cir. 108, 1907.]\r\n\r\nWater occurs in living wood in three conditions, namely: (1) in\r\nthe cell walls, (2) in the protoplasmic contents of the cells,\r\nand (3) as free water in the cell cavities and spaces. In\r\nheartwood it occurs only in the first and last forms. Wood that\r\nis thoroughly air-dried retains from 8 to 16 per cent of water\r\nin the cell walls, and none, or practically none, in the other\r\nforms. Even oven-dried wood retains a small percentage of\r\nmoisture, but for all except chemical purposes, may be\r\nconsidered absolutely dry.\r\n\r\nThe general effect of the water content upon the wood substance\r\nis to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect of\r\ncommon observation is in the softening action of water on\r\nrawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits the greater the\r\nwater content the greater its softening effect.\r\n\r\nDrying produces a decided increase in the strength of wood,\r\nparticularly in small specimens. An extreme example is the case\r\nof a completely dry spruce block two inches in section, which\r\nwill sustain a permanent load four times as great as that which\r\na green block of the same size will support.\r\n\r\nThe greatest increase due to drying is in the ultimate crushing\r\nstrength, and strength at elastic limit in endwise compression;\r\nthese are followed by the modulus of rupture, and stress at\r\nelastic limit in cross-bending, while the modulus of elasticity\r\nis least affected. These ratios are shown in Table XV, but it is\r\nto be noted that they apply only to wood in a much drier\r\ncondition than is used in practice. For air-dry wood the ratios\r\nare considerably lower, particularly in the case of the ultimate\r\nstrength and the elastic limit. Stiffness (within the elastic\r\nlimit), while following a similar law, is less affected. In the\r\ncase of shear parallel to the grain, the general effect of\r\ndrying is to increase the strength, but this is often offset by\r\nsmall splits and checks caused by shrinkage.\r\n\r\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                               TABLE XV                               |\r\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|   EFFECT OF DRYING ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF WOOD, SHOWN IN    |\r\n|       RATIO OF INCREASE DUE TO REDUCING MOISTURE CONTENT FROM        |\r\n|            THE GREEN CONDITION TO KILN-DRY (3.5 PER CENT)            |\r\n|                   (Forest Service Bul. 70, p. 89)                    |\r\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|      KIND OF STRENGTH      |  Longleaf   |   Spruce    |  Chestnut   |\r\n|                            |    pine     |             |             |\r\n|----------------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------|\r\n|                            |  (1)    (2) |  (1)    (2) |  (1)   (2)  |\r\n|                            |             |             |             |\r\n| Crushing strength parallel |             |             |             |\r\n|   to grain                 | 2.89   2.60 | 3.71   3.41 | 2.83   2.55 |\r\n| Elastic limit in           |             |             |             |\r\n|   compression              |             |             |             |\r\n|   parallel to grain        | 2.60   2.34 | 3.80   3.49 | 2.40   2.26 |\r\n| Modulus of rupture in      |             |             |             |\r\n|   bending                  | 2.50   2.20 | 2.81   2.50 | 2.09   1.82 |\r\n| Stress at elastic limit in |             |             |             |\r\n|   bending                  | 2.90   2.55 | 2.90   2.58 | 2.30   2.00 |\r\n| Crushing strength at right |             |             |             |\r\n|   angles to grain          |             | 2.58   2.48 |             |\r\n| Shearing strength parallel |             |             |             |\r\n|   to grain                 | 2.01   1.91 | 2.03   1.95 | 1.55   1.47 |\r\n| Modulus of elasticity in   |             |             |             |\r\n|   compression parallel to  |             |             |             |\r\n|   grain                    | 1.63   1.47 | 2.26   2.08 | 1.43   1.29 |\r\n| Modulus of elasticity in   |             |             |             |\r\n| bending                    | 1.59   1.35 | 1.43   1.23 | 1.44   1.21 |\r\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| NOTE.--The figures in the first column show the relative increase in |\r\n| strength between a green specimen and a kiln-dry specimen of equal   |\r\n| size.

In compression tests on very dry specimens\r\nthe entire piece splits suddenly into pieces before any buckling\r\ntakes place (see Fig. 9.), while with wet material the block\r\ngives way gradually, due to the buckling or bending of the walls\r\nof the fibres along one or more shearing planes. (See Fig. 14.)\r\nIn bending tests on wet beams, first failure occurs by\r\ncompression on top of the beam, gradually extending downward\r\ntoward the neutral axis. Finally the beam ruptures at the\r\nbottom. In the case of very dry beams the failure is usually by\r\nsplitting or tension on the under side (see Fig. 17.), without\r\ncompression on the upper, and is often sudden and without\r\nwarning, and even while the load is still increasing. The effect\r\nvaries somewhat with different species, chestnut, for example,\r\nbecoming more brittle upon drying than do ash, hemlock, and\r\nlongleaf pine. The tensile strength of wood is least affected by\r\ndrying, as a rule.\r\n\r\nIn drying wood no increase in strength results until the free\r\nwater is evaporated and the cell walls begin to dry[49]. This\r\ncritical point has been called the _fibre-saturation point_.\r\n(See Fig. 24.) Conversely, after the cell walls are saturated\r\nwith water, any increase in the amount of water absorbed merely\r\nfills the cavities and intercellular spaces, and has no effect\r\non the mechanical properties. Hence, soaking green wood does not\r\nlessen its strength unless the water is heated, whereupon a\r\ndecided weakening results.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: The wood of _Eucalyptus globulus_ (blue gum)\r\nappears to be an exception to this rule. Tiemann says: \"The wood\r\nof blue gum begins to shrink immediately from the green\r\ncondition, even at 70 to 90 per cent moisture content, instead\r\nof from 30 or 25 per cent as in other species of hardwoods.\"\r\nProc. Soc. Am. For., Washington, Vol. VIII, No. 3, Oct., 1913,\r\np. 313.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Relation of the moisture content to the\r\nvarious strength values of spruce. FSP = fibre-saturation\r\npoint.]\r\n\r\nThe strengthening effects of drying, while very marked in the\r\ncase of small pieces, may be fully offset in structural timbers\r\nby inherent weakening effects due to the splitting apart of the\r\nwood elements as a result of irregular shrinkage, and in some\r\ncases also to the slitting of the cell walls (see Fig. 25).\r\nConsequently with large timbers in commercial use it is unsafe\r\nto count upon any greater strength, even after seasoning, than\r\nthat of the green or fresh condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Cross section of the wood of western\r\nlarch showing fissures in the thick-walled cells of the late\r\nwood. Highly magnified. _Photo by U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nIn green wood the cells are all intimately joined together and\r\nare at their natural or normal size when saturated with water.\r\nThe cell walls may be considered as made up of little particles\r\nwith water between them. When wood is dried the films of water\r\nbetween the particles become thinner and thinner until almost\r\nentirely gone. As a result the cell walls grow thinner with loss\r\nof moisture,--in other words, the cell shrinks.\r\n\r\nIt is at once evident that if drying does not take place\r\nuniformly throughout an entire piece of timber, the shrinkage as\r\na whole cannot be uniform. The process of drying is from the\r\noutside inward, and if the loss of moisture at the surface is\r\nmet by a steady capillary current of water from the inside, the\r\nshrinkage, so far as the degree of moisture affected it, would\r\nbe uniform. In the best type of dry kilns this condition is\r\napproximated by first heating the wood thoroughly in a moist\r\natmosphere before allowing drying to begin.\r\n\r\nIn air-seasoning and in ordinary dry kilns this condition too\r\noften is not attained, and the result is that a dry shell is\r\nformed which encloses a moist interior. (See Fig. 26.)\r\nSubsequent drying out of the inner portion is rendered more\r\ndifficult by this \"case-hardened\" condition. As the outer part\r\ndries it is prevented from shrinking by the wet interior, which\r\nis still at its greatest volume. This outer portion must either\r\ncheck open or the fibres become strained in tension. If this\r\nouter shell dries while the fibres are thus strained they become\r\n\"set\" in this condition, and are no longer in tension. Later\r\nwhen the inner part dries, it tends to shrink away from the\r\nhardened outer shell, so that the inner fibres are now strained\r\nin tension and the outer fibres are in compression. If the\r\nstress exceeds the cohesion, numerous cracks open up, producing\r\na \"honey-combed\" condition, or \"hollow-horning,\" as it is\r\ncalled. If such a case-hardened stick of wood be resawed, the\r\ntwo halves will cup from the internal tension and external\r\ncompression, with the concave surface inward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Progress of drying throughout the\r\nlength of a chestnut beam, the black spots indicating the\r\npresence of free water in the wood. The first section at the\r\nleft was cut one-fourth inch from the end, the next one-half\r\ninch, the next one inch, and all the others one inch apart. The\r\nillustration shows case-hardening very clearly. _Photo by U. S.\r\nForest Service._]\r\n\r\nFor a given surface area the loss of water from wood is always\r\ngreater from the ends than from the sides, due to the fact that\r\nthe vessels and other water-carriers are cut across, allowing\r\nready entrance of drying air and outlet for the water vapor.\r\nWater does not flow out of boards and timbers of its own accord,\r\nbut must be evaporated, though it may be forced out of very\r\nsappy specimens by heat. In drying a log or pole with the bark\r\non, most of the water must be evaporated through the ends, but\r\nin the case of peeled timbers and sawn boards the loss is\r\ngreatest from the surface because the area exposed is so much\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nThe more rapid drying of the ends causes local shrinkage, and\r\nwere the material sufficiently plastic the ends would become\r\nbluntly tapering. The rigidity of the wood substance prevents\r\nthis and the fibres are split apart. Later, as the remainder of\r\nthe stick dries many of the checks will come together, though\r\nsome of the largest will remain and even increase in size as the\r\ndrying proceeds. (See Fig. 27.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Excessive season checking. _Photo by U.\r\nS. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nA wood cell shrinks very little lengthwise. A dry wood cell is,\r\ntherefore, practically of the same length as it was in a green\r\nor saturated condition, but is smaller in cross section, has\r\nthinner walls, and a larger cavity. It is at once evident that\r\nthis fact makes shrinkage more irregular, for wherever cells\r\ncross each other at a decided angle they will tend to pull apart\r\nupon drying. This occurs wherever pith rays and wood fibres\r\nmeet. A considerable portion of every wood is made up of these\r\nrays, which for the most part have their cells lying in a radial\r\ndirection instead of longitudinally. (See Frontispiece.) In\r\npine, over 15,000 of these occur on a square inch of a\r\ntangential section, and even in oak the very large rays which\r\nare readily visible to the eye as flakes on quarter-sawed\r\nmaterial represent scarcely one per cent of the number which the\r\nmicroscope reveals.\r\n\r\nA pith ray shrinks in height and width, that is, vertically and\r\ntangentially as applied to the position in a standing tree, but\r\nvery little in length or radially. The other elements of the\r\nwood shrink radially and tangentially, but almost none\r\nlengthwise or vertically as applied to the tree. Here, then, we\r\nfind the shrinkage of the rays tending to shorten a stick of\r\nwood, while the other cells resist it, and the tendency of a\r\nstick to get smaller in circumference is resisted by the endwise\r\nreaction or thrust of the rays. Only in a tangential direction,\r\nor around the stick in direction of the annual rings of growth,\r\ndo the two forces coincide. Another factor to the same end is\r\nthat the denser bands of late wood are continuous in a\r\ntangential direction, while radially they are separated by\r\nalternate zones of less dense early wood. Consequently the\r\nshrinkage along the rings (tangential) is fully twice as much as\r\ntoward the centre (radial). (See Table XIV.) This explains why\r\nsome cracks open more and more as drying advances. (See Fig.\r\n27.)\r\n\r\nAlthough actual shrinkage in length is small, nevertheless the\r\ntendency of the rays to shorten a stick produces strains which\r\nare responsible for some of the splitting open of ties, posts,\r\nand sawed timbers with box heart. At the very centre of a tree\r\nthe wood is light and weak, while farther out it becomes denser\r\nand stronger. Longitudinal shrinkage is accordingly least at the\r\ncentre and greater toward the outside, tending to become\r\ngreatest in the sapwood. When a round or a box-heart timber\r\ndries fast it splits radially, and as drying continues the cleft\r\nwidens partly on account of the greater tangential shrinkage and\r\nalso because the greater contraction of the outer fibres warps\r\nthe sections apart. If a small hardwood stem is split while\r\ngreen for a short distance at the end and placed where it can\r\ndry out rapidly, the sections will become bow-shaped with the\r\nconcave sides out. These various facts, taken together, explain\r\nwhy, for example, an oak tie, pole, or log may split open its\r\nentire length if drying proceeds rapidly and far enough. Initial\r\nstresses in the living trees produce a similar effect when the\r\nlog is sawn into boards. This is especially so in _Eucalyptus\r\nglobulus_ and to a less extent with any rapidly grown wood.\r\n\r\nThe use of S-shaped thin steel clamps to prevent large checks\r\nand splits is now a common practice in this country with\r\ncrossties and poles as it has been for a long time in European\r\ncountries. These devices are driven into the butts of the\r\ntimbers so as to cross incipient checks and prevent their\r\nwidening. In place of the regular S-hook another of crimped iron\r\nhas been devised. (See Fig. 28.) Thin straps of iron with one\r\ntapered edge are run between intermeshing cogs and crimped,\r\nafter which they may be cut off any length desired. The time for\r\ndriving S-irons of either form is when the cracks first appear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Control of season checking by the use\r\nof S-irons. _Photo by U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nThe tendency of logs to split emphasizes the importance of\r\nconverting them into planks or timbers while in a green\r\ncondition. Otherwise the presence of large checks may render\r\nmuch lumber worthless which might have been cut out in good\r\ncondition. The loss would not be so great if logs were perfectly\r\nstraight-grained, but this is seldom the case, most trees\r\ngrowing more or less spirally or irregularly. Large pieces crack\r\nmore than smaller ones, quartered lumber less than that sawed\r\nthrough and through, thin pieces, especially veneers, less than\r\nthicker boards.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent cracks at the ends of boards, small straps\r\nof wood may be nailed on them or they may be painted. This\r\nmethod is usually considered too expensive, except in the case\r\nof valuable material. Squares used for shuttles, furniture,\r\ngun-stocks, and tool handles should always be protected at the\r\nends. One of the best means is to dip them into melted\r\nparaffine, which seals the ends and prevents loss of moisture\r\nthere. Another method is to glue paper on the ends. In some\r\ncases abroad paper is glued on to all the surfaces of valuable\r\nexotic balks. Other substances sometimes employed for the\r\npurpose of sealing the wood are grease, carbolineum, wax, clay,\r\npetroleum, linseed oil, tar, and soluble glass. In place of\r\nsolid beams, built-up material is often preferable, as the\r\ndisastrous results of season checks are thereby largely overcome\r\nor minimized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of temperature on wood depends very largely upon the\r\nmoisture content of the wood and the surrounding medium. If\r\nabsolutely dry wood is heated in absolutely dry air the wood\r\nexpands. The extent of this expansion is denoted by a\r\ncoefficient corresponding to the increase in length or other\r\ndimensions for each degree rise in temperature divided by the\r\noriginal length or other dimension of the specimen. The\r\ncoefficient of linear expansion of oak has been found to be\r\n.00000492; radial expansion, .0000544, or about eleven times the\r\nlongitudinal. Spruce expands less than oak, the ratio of radial\r\nto longitudinal expansion being about six to one. Metals and\r\nglass expand equally in all directions, since they are\r\nhomogeneous substances, while wood is a complicated structure.\r\nThe coefficient of expansion of iron is .0000285, or nearly six\r\ntimes the coefficient of linear expansion of oak and seven times\r\nthat of spruce[50].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: See Schlich's Manual of Forestry, Vol. V. (rev.\r\ned.), p. 75.]\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary conditions wood contains more or less moisture,\r\nso that the application of heat has a drying effect which is\r\naccompanied by shrinkage. This shrinkage completely obscures the\r\nexpansion due to the heating.\r\n\r\nExperiments made at the Yale Forest School revealed the effect\r\nof temperature on the crushing strength of wet wood. In the case\r\nof wet chestnut wood the strength decreases 0.42 per cent for\r\neach degree the water is heated above 60° F.; in the case of\r\nspruce the decrease is 0.32 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe effects of high temperature on wet wood are very marked.\r\nBoiling produces a condition of great pliability, especially in\r\nthe case of hardwoods. If wood in this condition is bent and\r\nallowed to dry, it rigidly retains the shape of the bend, though\r\nits strength may be somewhat reduced. Except in the case of very\r\ndry wood the effect of cold is to increase the strength and\r\nstiffness of wood. The freezing of any free water in the pores\r\nof the wood will augment these conditions.\r\n\r\nThe effect of steaming upon the strength of cross-ties was\r\ninvestigated by the U.S. Forest Service in 1904. The conclusions\r\nwere summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n\"(1) The steam at pressure up to 40 pounds applied for 4 hours,\r\nor at a pressure of 20 pounds up to 20 hours, increases the\r\nweight of ties. At 40 pounds' pressure applied for 4 hours and\r\nat 20 pounds for 5 hours the wood began to be scorched.\r\n\r\n\"(2) The steamed and saturated wood, when tested immediately\r\nafter treatment, exhibited weaknesses in proportion to the\r\npressure and duration of steaming. (See Table XVI.) If allowed\r\nto air-dry subsequently the specimens regained the greater part\r\nof their strength, provided the pressure and duration had not\r\nexceeded those cited under (1). Subsequent immersion in water of\r\nthe steamed wood and dried specimens showed that they were\r\nweaker than natural wood similarly dried and resoaked.\"[51]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Cir. 39.

The degree of steaming at which\r\npronounced harm results will depend upon the quality of the wood\r\nand its degree of seasoning, and upon the pressure (temperature)\r\nof steam and the duration of its application. For loblolly pine\r\nthe limit of safety is certainly 30 pounds for 4 hours, or 20\r\npounds for 6 hours.\"[52]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: _Ibid._, p. 21. See also Cir. 108, p. 19, table\r\n5.]\r\n\r\nExperiments made at the Yale Forest School showed that steaming\r\nabove 30 pounds' gauge pressure reduces the strength of wood\r\npermanently while wet from 25 to 75 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATIVES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exact effects of chemical impregnation upon the mechanical\r\nproperties of wood have not been fully determined, though they\r\nhave been the subject of considerable investigation.[53] More\r\ndepends upon the method of treatment than upon the preservatives\r\nused. Thus preliminary steaming at too high pressure or for too\r\nlong a period will materially weaken the wood, (See TEMPERATURE,\r\nabove.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: Hatt, W. K.: Experiments on the strength of\r\ntreated timber. Cir. 39, U.S. Forest Service, 1906, p. 31.]\r\n\r\nThe presence of zinc chloride does not weaken wood under static\r\nloading, although the indications are that the wood becomes\r\nbrittle under impact. If the solution is too strong it will\r\ndecompose the wood.\r\n\r\nSoaking in creosote oil causes wood to swell, and accordingly\r\ndecreases the strength to some extent, but not nearly so much so\r\nas soaking in water.[54]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Teesdale, Clyde II.: The absorption of creosote by\r\nthe cell walls of wood.

S. Forest Service.\r\nSee Cir. 38 (rev. ed.), 1909.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKING PLAN\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary to making a series of timber tests it is very\r\nimportant that a working plan be prepared as a guide to the\r\ninvestigation. This should embrace: (1) the purpose of the\r\ntests; (2) kind, size, condition, and amount of material needed;\r\n(3) full description of the system of marking the pieces; (4)\r\ndetails of any special apparatus and methods employed; (5)\r\nproposed method of analyzing the data obtained and the nature of\r\nthe final report. Great care should be taken in the preparation\r\nof this plan in order that all problems arising may be\r\nanticipated so far as possible and delays and unnecessary work\r\navoided. A comprehensive study of previous investigations along\r\nthe same or related lines should prove very helpful in outlining\r\nthe work and preparing the report. (For sample working plan see\r\nAppendix.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMS OF MATERIAL TESTED\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, four forms of material are tested, namely: (1) large\r\ntimbers, such as bridge stringers, car sills, large beams, and\r\nother pieces five feet or more in length, of actual sizes and\r\ngrades in common use; (2) built-up structural forms and\r\nfastenings, such as built-up beams, trusses, and various kind of\r\njoints; (3) small clear pieces, such as are used in compression,\r\nshear, cleavage, and small cross-breaking tests; (4)\r\nmanufactured articles, such as axles, spokes, shafts,\r\nwagon-tongues, cross-arms, insulator pins, barrels, and packing\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\nAs the moisture content is of fundamental importance (see WATER\r\nCONTENT, above.), all standard tests are usually made in the\r\ngreen condition. Another series is also usually run in an\r\nair-dry condition of about 12 per cent moisture. In all cases\r\nthe moisture is very carefully determined and stated with the\r\nresults in the tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE OF TEST SPECIMENS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe size of the test specimen must be governed largely by the\r\npurpose for which the test is made. If the effect of a single\r\nfactor, such as moisture, is the object of experiment, it is\r\nnecessary to use small pieces of wood in order to eliminate so\r\nfar as possible all disturbing factors. If the specimens are too\r\nlarge, it is impossible to secure enough perfect pieces from one\r\ntree to form a series for various tests. Moreover, the drying\r\nprocess with large timbers is very difficult and irregular, and\r\nrequires a long period of time, besides causing checks and\r\ninternal stresses which may obscure the results obtained.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the smaller the dimensions of the test\r\nspecimen the greater becomes the relative effect of the inherent\r\nfactors affecting the mechanical properties. For example, the\r\neffect of a knot of given size is more serious in a small stick\r\nthan in a large one. Moreover, the smaller the specimen the\r\nfewer growth rings it contains, hence there is greater\r\nopportunity for variation due to irregularities of grain.\r\n\r\nTests on large timbers are considered necessary to furnish\r\ndesigners data on the probable strength of the different sizes\r\nand grades of timber on the market; their coefficients of\r\nelasticity under bending (since the stiffness rather than the\r\nstrength often determines the size of a beam); and the manner of\r\nfailure, whether in bending fibre stress or horizontal shear. It\r\nis believed that this information can only be obtained by direct\r\ntests on the different grades of car sills, stringers, and other\r\nmaterial in common use.\r\n\r\nWhen small pieces are selected for test they very often are\r\nclear and straight-grained, and thus of so much better grade\r\nthan the large sticks that tests upon them may not yield unit\r\nvalues applicable to the larger sizes. Extensive experiments\r\nshow, however, (1) that the modulus of elasticity is\r\napproximately the same for large timbers as for small clear\r\nspecimens cut from them, and (2) that the fibre stress at\r\nelastic limit for large beams is, except in the weakest timbers,\r\npractically equal to the crushing strength of small clear pieces\r\nof the same material.[57]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Bul. 108, U. S. Forest Service: Tests of\r\nstructural timbers, pp. 53-54.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOISTURE  DETERMINATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order for tests to be comparable, it is necessary to know the\r\nmoisture content of the specimens at the zone of failure. This\r\nis determined from disks an inch thick cut from the timber\r\nimmediately after testing.\r\n\r\nIn cases, as in large beams, where it is desirable to know not\r\nonly the average moisture content but also its distribution\r\nthrough the timber, the disks are cut up so as to obtain an\r\noutside, a middle, and an inner portion, of approximately equal\r\nareas. Thus in a section 10\" x 12\" the outer strip would be one\r\ninch wide, and the second one a little more than an inch and a\r\nquarter. Moisture determinations are made for each of the three\r\nportions separately.\r\n\r\nThe procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Immediately after sawing, loose splinters are removed and\r\neach section is weighed.\r\n\r\n(2) The material is put into a drying oven at 100° C. (212° F.)\r\nand dried until the variation in weight for a period of\r\ntwenty-four hours is less than 0.5 per cent.\r\n\r\n(3) The disk is again carefully weighed.\r\n\r\n(4) The loss in weight expressed in per cent of the dry weight\r\nindicates the moisture content of the specimen from which the\r\nspecimen was cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACHINE FOR STATIC TESTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe standard screw machines used for metal tests are also used\r\nfor wood, but in the case of wood tests the readings must be\r\ntaken \"on the fly,\" and the machine operated at a uniform speed\r\nwithout interruption from beginning to end of the test. This is\r\non account of the time factor in the strength of wood. (See\r\nSPEED OF TESTING MACHINE, below.)\r\n\r\nThe standard machines for static tests can be used for\r\ntransverse bending, compression, tension, shear, and cleavage. A\r\ncommon form consists of three main parts, namely: (1) the\r\nstraining mechanism, (2) the weighing apparatus, and (3) the\r\nmachinery for communicating motion to the screws.\r\n\r\nThe straining mechanism consists of two parts, one of which is a\r\nmovable crosshead operated by four (sometimes two or three)\r\nupright steel straining screws which pass through openings in\r\nthe platform and bear upward on the bed of the machine upon\r\nwhich the weighing platform rests as a fulcrum. At the lower\r\nends of these screws are geared nuts all rotated simultaneously\r\nby a system of gears which cause the movable crosshead to rise\r\nand fall as desired.\r\n\r\nThe stationary part of the straining mechanism, which is used\r\nonly for tension and cleavage tests, consists of a steel cage\r\nabove the movable crosshead and rests directly upon the weighing\r\nplatform. The top of the cage contains a square hole into which\r\none end of the test specimen may be clamped, the crosshead\r\ncontaining a similar clamp for the other end, in making tension\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nFor testing long beams a special form of machine with an\r\nextended platform is used. (See Fig. 29.)\r\n\r\nThe weighing platform rests upon knife edges carried by primary\r\nlevers of the weighing apparatus, the fulcrum being on the bed\r\nof the machine, and any pressure upon it is directly transmitted\r\nthrough a series of levers to the weighing beam. This beam is\r\nadjusted by means of a poise running on a screw. In operation\r\nthe beam is kept floating by means of another poise moved back\r\nand forth by a screw which is operated by a hand wheel or\r\nautomatically. The larger units of stress are read from the\r\ngraduations along the side of the beam, while the intermediate\r\nsmaller weights are observed on the dial on the rear end of the\r\nbeam.\r\n\r\nThe machine is driven by power from a shaft or a motor and is so\r\ngeared that various speeds are obtainable. One man can operate\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn making tests the operation of the straining screws is always\r\ndownward so as to bring pressure to bear upon the weighing\r\nplatform. For tests in tension and cleavage the specimen is\r\nplaced between the top of the stationary cage and the movable\r\nhead and subjected to a pull. For tests in transverse bending,\r\ncompression, and cleavage the specimen is placed between the\r\nmovable head and the platform, and a direct compression force\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nTesting machines are usually calibrated to a portion of their\r\ncapacity before leaving the factory. The delicacy of the\r\nweighing levers is verified by determining the number of pounds\r\nnecessary to move the beam between the stops while a load of\r\n1,000 pounds rests on the platform. The usual requirement is\r\nthat ten pounds should accomplish this movement.\r\n\r\nThe size of machine suitable for compression tests on 2\" X 2\"\r\nsticks or for 2\" X 2\" beams with 26 to 36-inch span has a\r\ncapacity of 30,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEED OF TESTING MACHINE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn instructions for making static tests the rate of application\r\nof the stress, _i.e._, the speed of the machine, is given\r\nbecause the strength of wood varies with the speed at which the\r\nfibres are strained. The speed of the crosshead of the testing\r\nmachine is practically never constant, due to mechanical defects\r\nof the apparatus and variations in the speed of the motor, but\r\nso long as it does not exceed 25 per cent the results will not\r\nbe appreciably affected. In fact, a change in speed of 50 per\r\ncent will not cause the strength of the wood to vary more than 2\r\nper cent.[58]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: See Tiemann, Harry Donald: The effect of the speed\r\nof testing upon the strength and the standardization of tests\r\nfor speed. Proc. Am. Soc. for Testing Materials, Vol. VIII,\r\nPhiladelphia, 1908.]\r\n\r\nFollowing are the formulæ used in determining the speed of the\r\nmovable head of the machine in inches per minute (n):\r\n\r\n(1) For endwise compression          n = Z l\r\n\r\n                                          Z l^{2}\r\n(2) For beams (centre loading)       n = ---------\r\n                                            6h\r\n\r\n                                          Z l^{2}\r\n(3) For beams (third-pointloading)   n = ---------\r\n                                           5.4h\r\n\r\n  Z = rate of fibre strain per inch of fibre length.\r\n  l = span of beam or length of compression specimen.\r\n  h = height of beam.\r\n\r\nThe values commonly used for Z are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Bending large beams                      Z = 0.0007\r\n  Bending small beams                      Z = 0.0015\r\n  Endwise compression-large specimens      Z = 0.0015\r\n  Endwise compression-small       \"        Z = 0.003\r\n  Right-angled compression-large  \"        Z = 0.007\r\n  Right-angled compression-small  \"        Z = 0.015\r\n  Shearing parallel to the grain           Z = 0.015\r\n\r\nExample: At what speed should the crosshead move to give the\r\nrequired rate of fibre strain in testing a small beam 2\" X 2\" X\r\n30\". (Span = 28\".) Substituting these values in equation (2)\r\nabove:\r\n          (0.0015 X 28^2)\r\n     n = ----------------- = 0.1 inch per minute.\r\n              (6 X 2)\r\n\r\nIn order that tests may be intelligently compared, it is\r\nimportant that account be taken of the speed at which the stress\r\nwas applied. In determining the basis for a ratio between time\r\nand strength the rate of strain, which is controllable, and not\r\nthe ratio of stress, which is circumstantial, should be used. In\r\nother words, the rate at which the movable head of the testing\r\nmachine descends and not the rate of increase in the load is to\r\nbe regulated. This ratio, to which the name _speed-strength\r\nmodulus_ has been given, may be expressed as a coefficient\r\nwhich, if multiplied into any proportional change in speed, will\r\ngive the proportional change in strength. This ratio is derived\r\nfrom empirical curves.

LARGE BEAMS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Apparatus_: A static bending machine (described above), with a\r\nspecial crosshead for third-point loading and a long platform\r\nbearing knife-edge supports, is required. (See Fig. 29.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Static bending test on large beam. Note\r\narrangement of wire and scale for measuring deflection; also\r\nmethod of applying load at \"third-points.\"]\r\n\r\n_Preparing the material_: Standard sizes and grades of beams and\r\ntimbers in common use are employed. The ends are roughly squared\r\nand the specimen weighed and measured, taking the\r\ncross-sectional dimensions midway of the length. Weights should\r\nbe to the nearest pound, lengths to the nearest 0.1 inch, and\r\ncross-sectional dimensions to the nearest 0.01 inch.\r\n\r\n_Marking and sketching_: The butt end of the beam is marked _A_\r\nand the top end _B_. While facing _A_, the top side is marked\r\n_a_, the right hand _b_, the bottom _c_, the left hand _d_.\r\nSketches are made of each side and end, showing (1) size,\r\nlocation, and condition of knots, checks, splits, and other\r\ndefects; (2) irregularities of grain; (3) distribution of\r\nheartwood and sapwood; and on the ends: (4) the location of the\r\npith and the arrangement of the growth rings, (5) number of\r\nrings per inch, and (6) the proportion of late wood.\r\n\r\nThe number of rings per inch and the proportion of late wood\r\nshould always be determined along a radius or a line normal to\r\nthe rings. The average number of rings per inch is the total\r\nnumber of rings divided by the length of the line crossing them.\r\nThe proportion of late wood is equal to the sum of the widths of\r\nthe late wood crossed by the line, divided by the length of the\r\nline. Rings per inch should be to the nearest 0.1; late wood to\r\nthe nearest 0.1 per cent.\r\n\r\nSince in large beams a great variation in rate of growth and\r\nrelative amount of late wood is likely in different parts of the\r\nsection, it is advisable to consider the cross section in three\r\nvolumes, namely, the upper and lower quarters and the middle\r\nhalf. The determination should be made upon each volume\r\nseparately, and the average for the entire cross section\r\nobtained from these results.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the test the failure, as it appears on each\r\nsurface, is traced on the sketches, with the failures numbered\r\nin the order of their occurrence. If the beam is subsequently\r\ncut up and used for other tests an additional sketch may be\r\ndesirable to show the location of each piece.\r\n\r\n_Adjusting specimen in machine_: The beam is placed in the\r\nmachine with the side marked _a_ on top, and with the ends\r\nprojecting equally beyond the supports. In order to prevent\r\ncrushing of the fibre at the points where the stress is applied\r\nit is necessary to use bearing blocks of maple or other hard\r\nwood with a convex surface in contact with the beam. Roller\r\nbearings should be placed between the bearing blocks and the\r\nknife edges of the crosshead to allow for the shortening due to\r\nflexure. (See Fig. 29.) Third-point loading is used, that is,\r\nthe load is applied at two points one-third the span of the beam\r\napart. (See Fig. 30.) This affords a uniform bending moment\r\nthroughout the central third of the beam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Two methods of loading a beam, namely,\r\nthird-point loading (upper), and centre loading (lower).]\r\n\r\n_Measuring the deflection_: The method of measuring the\r\ndeflection should be such that any compression at the points of\r\nsupport or at the application of the load will not affect the\r\nreading. This may be accomplished by driving a small nail near\r\neach end of the beam, the exact location being on the neutral\r\nplane and vertically above each knife-edge support. Between\r\nthese nails a fine wire is stretched free of the beam and kept\r\ntaut by means of a rubber band or coiled spring on one end.\r\nBehind the wire at a point on the beam midway between the\r\nsupports a steel scale graduated to hundredths of an inch is\r\nfastened vertically by means of thumb-tacks or small screws\r\npassing through holes in it. Attachment should be made on the\r\nneutral plane.\r\n\r\nThe first reading is made when the scale beam is balanced at\r\nzero load, and afterward at regular increments of the load which\r\nis applied continuously and at a uniform speed. (See SPEED OF\r\nTESTING MACHINE, above.) If desired, however, the load may be\r\nread at regular increments of deflection. The deflection\r\nreadings should be to the nearest 0.01 inch. To avoid error due\r\nto parallax, the readings may be taken by means of a reading\r\ntelescope about ten feet distant and approximately on a level\r\nwith the wire. A mirror fastened to the scale will increase the\r\naccuracy of the readings if the telescope is not used. As in all\r\ntests on timber, the strain must be continuous to rupture, not\r\nintermittent, and readings must be taken \"on the fly.\" The\r\nweighing beam is kept balanced after the yield point is reached\r\nand the maximum load, and at least one point beyond it, noted.\r\n\r\n_Log of the test_: The proper log sheet for this test consists\r\nof a piece of cross-section paper with space at the margin for\r\nnotes. (See Fig. 32.) The load in some convenient unit (1,000 to\r\n10,000 pounds, depending upon the dimensions of the specimen) is\r\nentered on the ordinates, the deflection in tenths of an inch on\r\nthe abscissæ. The increments of load should be chosen so as to\r\nfurnish about ten points on the stress-strain diagram below the\r\nelastic limit.\r\n\r\nAs the readings of the wire on the scale are made they are\r\nentered directly in their proper place on the cross-section\r\npaper. In many cases a test should be continued until complete\r\nfailure results. The points where the various failures occur are\r\nindicated on the stress-strain diagram. A brief description of\r\nthe failure is made on the margin of the log sheet, and the form\r\ntraced on the sketches.\r\n\r\n_Disposal of the specimen_: Two one-inch sections are cut from\r\nthe region of failure to be used in determining the moisture\r\ncontent. (See MOISTURE DETERMINATION, above.) A two-inch section\r\nmay be cut for subsequent reference and identification, and\r\npossible microscopic study. The remainder of the beam may be cut\r\ninto small beams and compression pieces.\r\n\r\n_Calculating the results_: The formulæ used in calculating the\r\nresults of tests on large rectangular simple beams loaded at\r\nthird points of the span are as follows:\r\n\r\n              0.75 P\r\n     (1) J = --------\r\n               b h\r\n\r\n              l (P_{1} + 0.75 W)\r\n     (2) r = --------------------\r\n                   b h^{2}\r\n\r\n              l (P + 0.75 W)\r\n     (3) R = ----------------\r\n                 b h^{2}\r\n\r\n               P_{1} l^{3}\r\n     (4) E = ---------------\r\n              4.7 D b h^{3}\r\n\r\n              0.87 P_{1} D\r\n     (5) S = --------------\r\n                  2 V\r\n\r\n  b, h, l = breadth, height, and span of specimen, inches.\r\n  D = total deflection at elastic limit, inches.\r\n  P = maximum load, pounds.\r\n  P_{1} = load at elastic limit, pounds.\r\n  E = modulus of elasticity, pounds per square inch.\r\n  r = fibre stress at elastic limit, pounds per sq. inch.\r\n  R = modulus of rupture, pounds per square inch.\r\n  S = elastic resilience or work to elastic limit, inch-pounds\r\n        per cu. in.\r\n  J = greatest calculated longitudinal shear, pounds per square\r\n        inch.\r\n  V = volume of beam, cubic inches.\r\n  W = weight of the beam.\r\n\r\nIn large beams the weight should be taken into account in\r\ncalculating the fibre stress. In (2) and (3) three-fourths of\r\nthe weight of the beam is added to the load for this reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBENDING SMALL BEAMS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Apparatus_: An ordinary static bending machine, a steel I-beam\r\nbearing two adjustable knife-edge supports to rest on the\r\nplatform, and a special deflectometer, are required. (See Fig.\r\n31.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Static bending test on small beam. Note\r\nthe use of the deflectometer with indicator and dial for\r\nmeasuring the deflection; also roller bearings between beam and\r\nsupports.]\r\n\r\n_Preparing the material_: The specimens may be of any convenient\r\nsize, though beams 2\" X 2\" X 30\" tested over a 28-inch span, are\r\nconsidered best. The beams are surfaced on all four sides, care\r\nbeing taken that they are not damaged by the rollers of the\r\nsurfacing machine. Material for these tests is sometimes cut\r\nfrom large beams after failure. The specimens are carefully\r\nweighed in grams, and all dimensions measured to the nearest\r\n0.01 inch. If to be tested in a green or fresh condition the\r\nspecimens should be kept in a damp box or covered with moist\r\nsawdust until needed. No defects should be allowed in these\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n_Marking and sketching_: Sketches are made of each end of the\r\nspecimen to show the character of the growth, and after testing,\r\nthe manner of failure is shown for all four sides. In obtaining\r\ndata regarding the rate of growth and the proportion of late\r\nwood the same procedure is followed as with large beams.\r\n\r\n_Adjusting specimen in machine_: The beam should be correctly\r\ncentred in the machine and each end should have a plate with\r\nroller bearings between it and the support. Centre loading is\r\nused. Between the movable head of the machine and the specimen\r\nis placed a bearing block of maple or other hard wood, the lower\r\nsurface of which is curved in a direction along the beam, the\r\ncurvature of which should be slightly less than that of the beam\r\nat rupture, in order to prevent the edges from crushing into the\r\nfibres of the test piece.\r\n\r\n_Measuring the deflection_: The method of measuring deflection\r\nof large beams can be used for small sizes, but because of the\r\nshortness of the span and consequent slight deformation in the\r\nlatter, it is hardly accurate enough for good work. The special\r\ndeflectometer shown in Fig. 31 allows closer reading, as it\r\nmagnifies the deflection ten times. It rests on two small nails\r\ndriven in the beam on the neutral plane and vertically above the\r\nsupports. The fine wire on the wheel at the base of the\r\nindicator is attached to another small nail driven in the beam\r\non the neutral plane midway between the end nails. All three\r\nnails should be in place before the beam is put into the\r\nmachine. The indicator is adjustable by means of a thumb-screw\r\nat the base and is set at zero before the load is applied.\r\nDeflections are read to the nearest 0.001 inch. For rate of\r\napplication of load see SPEED OF TESTING MACHINE, above. The\r\nspeed should be uniform from start to finish without stopping.\r\nReadings must be made \"on the fly.\"\r\n\r\n_Log of the test_: The log sheets used for small beams (see Fig.\r\n32) are the same as for large sizes and the procedure is\r\npractically identical. The stress-strain diagram is continued to\r\nor beyond the maximum load, and in a portion of the tests should\r\nbe continued to six-inch deflection or until the specimen fails\r\nto support a load of 200 pounds. Deflection readings for equal\r\nincrements of load are taken until well beyond the elastic\r\nlimit, after which the scale beam is kept balanced and the load\r\nread for each 0.1 inch deflection. The load and deflection at\r\nfirst failure, the maximum load, and any points of sudden change\r\nshould be shown on the diagram, even though they do not occur at\r\none of the regular points. A brief description of the failure\r\nand the nature of any defects is entered on the log sheet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Sample log sheet, giving full details\r\nof a transverse bending test on a small pine beam.]\r\n\r\n_Calculating the results_: The formulæ used in calculating the\r\nresults of tests on small rectangular simple beams are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n              0.75 P\r\n     (1) J = --------\r\n               b h\r\n\r\n              1.5 P_{1} l\r\n     (2) r = -------------\r\n                b h^{2}\r\n\r\n              1.5 P l\r\n     (3) R = ---------\r\n              b h^{2}\r\n\r\n              P_{1} l^{3}\r\n     (4) E = -------------\r\n              4 D b h^{3}\r\n\r\n              P_{1} D\r\n     (5) S = ---------\r\n                2 V\r\n\r\nThe same legend is used as in BENDING LARGE BEAMS. The weight of\r\nthe beam itself is disregarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDWISE COMPRESSION\r\n\r\n\r\n_Apparatus_: An ordinary static testing machine and a\r\ncompressometer are required. (See Fig. 33.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Endwise compression test, showing\r\nmethod of measuring the deformation by means of a\r\ncompressometer.]\r\n\r\n_Preparing the material_: Two classes of specimens are commonly\r\nused, namely, (1) posts 24 inches in length, and (2) small clear\r\nblocks approximately 2\" X 2\" X 8\". The specimens are surfaced on\r\nall four sides and both ends squared smoothly and evenly. They\r\nare carefully weighed, measured, rate of growth and proportion\r\nof late wood determined, as in bending tests. After the test a\r\nmoisture section is cut and weighed. Ordinarily these specimens\r\nshould be free from defects.\r\n\r\n_Sketching_: Sketches are made of each end of the specimens to\r\nshow the character of the growth. After testing, the manner of\r\nfailure is shown for all four sides, and the various parts of\r\nthe failure are numbered in the order of their occurrence.\r\n\r\n_Adjusting specimen in machine_: The compressometer collars are\r\nadjusted, the distance between them being 20 inches for the\r\nposts and 6 inches for the blocks. If the two ends of the blocks\r\nare not exactly parallel a ball-and-socket block can be placed\r\nbetween the upper end of the specimen and the movable head of\r\nthe machine to overcome the irregularity. If the blocks are true\r\nthey can simply be stood on end upon the platform and the\r\nmovable head allowed to press directly upon the upper end.\r\n\r\n_Measuring the deformation_: The deformation is measured by a\r\ncompressometer. (See Fig. 33.) The latter registers to 0.001\r\ninch. In the case of posts the compression between the collars\r\nis communicated to the four points on the arms by means of brass\r\nrods; with short blocks, as in Fig. 33, the points of the arms\r\nare in direct contact with the collars. The operator lowers the\r\nfulcrum of the apparatus by moving the micrometer screws at such\r\na rate that the set-screw in the rear end of the upper lever is\r\nkept barely touching the fixed arm below it, being guided by a\r\nbell operated by electric contact.\r\n\r\n_Log of the test_: The load is applied continuously at a uniform\r\nrate of speed. (See SPEED OF TESTING MACHINE, above.) Readings\r\nare taken from the scale of the compressometer at regular\r\nincrements of either load or compression. The stress-strain\r\ndiagram is continued to at least one deformation point beyond\r\nthe maximum load, and in event of sudden failure, the direction\r\nof the curve beyond the maximum point is indicated. A brief\r\ndescription of the failure is entered on the log sheet. (See\r\nFig. 34.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Sample log sheet of an endwise\r\ncompression test on a short pine column.]\r\n\r\nIn short specimens the failure usually occurs in one or several\r\nplanes diagonal to the axis of the specimen. If the ends are\r\nmore moist than the middle a crushing may occur on the extreme\r\nends in a horizontal plane. Such a test is not valid and should\r\nalways be culled. If the grain is diagonal or the stress is\r\nunevenly applied a diagonal shear may occur from top to bottom\r\nof the test specimen. Such tests are also invalid and should be\r\nculled. When the plane (or several planes) of failure occurs\r\nthrough the body of the specimen the test is valid. It may\r\nsometimes be advantageous to allow the extreme ends to dry\r\nslightly before testing in order to bring the planes of failure\r\nwithin the body. This is a perfectly legitimate procedure\r\nprovided no drying is allowed from the sides of the specimen,\r\nand the moisture disk is cut from the region of failure.\r\n\r\n_Calculating the results:_ The formulæ used in calculating the\r\nresults of tests on endwise compression are as follows:\r\n\r\n              P\r\n     (1) C = -----\r\n              A\r\n\r\n              P_{1}\r\n     (2) c = -------\r\n                A\r\n\r\n              P_{1} l\r\n     (3) E = ---------\r\n                A D\r\n\r\n              P D\r\n     (4) S = -----\r\n              2 V\r\n\r\n  C = crushing strength, pounds per square inch.\r\n  c = fibre strength at elastic limit, pounds per square inch.\r\n  A = area of cross section, square inches.\r\n  l = distance between centres of collars, inches.\r\n  D = total shortening at elastic limit, inches.\r\n  V = volume of specimen, cubic inches.\r\n\r\nRemainder of legend as in BENDING LARGE BEAMS, above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPRESSION ACROSS THE GRAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n_Apparatus_: An ordinary static testing machine, a bearing\r\nplate, and a deflectometer are required. (See Fig. 35.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Compression across the grain. Note\r\nmethod of measuring the deformation by means of a\r\ndeflectomoter.]\r\n\r\n_Preparing the material_: Two classes of specimens are used,\r\nnamely, (1) sections of commercial sizes of ties, beams, and\r\nother timbers, and (2) small, clear specimens with the length\r\nseveral times the width. Sometimes small cubes are tested, but\r\nthe results are hardly applicable to conditions in practice. In\r\n(2) the sides are surfaced and the ends squared. The specimens\r\nare then carefully measured and weighed, defects noted, rate of\r\ngrowth and proportion of late wood determined, as in bending\r\ntests. (See BENDING LARGE BEAMS, above.) After the test a\r\nmoisture section is cut and weighed.\r\n\r\n_Sketching_: Sketches are made as in endwise compression tests.\r\n(See ENDWISE COMPRESSION, above.)\r\n\r\n_Adjusting specimen in machine_: The specimen is laid\r\nhorizontally upon the platform of the machine and a steel\r\nbearing plate placed on its upper surface immediately beneath\r\nthe centre of the movable head. For the larger specimens this\r\nplate is six inches wide; for the smaller sizes, two inches\r\nwide. The plate in all cases projects over the edges of the test\r\npiece, and in no case should the length of the latter be less\r\nthan four times the width of the plate.\r\n\r\n_Measuring the deformation_: The compression is measured by\r\nmeans of a deflectometer (see Fig. 35), which, after the first\r\nincrement of load is applied, is adjusted (by means of a small\r\nset screw) to read zero. The actual downward motion of the\r\nmovable head (corresponding to the compression of the specimen)\r\nis multiplied ten times on the scale from which the readings are\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n_Log of the test_: The load is applied continuously and at\r\nuniform speed (see SPEED OF TESTING MACHINE, above), until well\r\nbeyond the elastic limit. The compression readings are taken at\r\nregular load increments and entered on the cross-section paper\r\nin the usual way. Usually there is no real maximum load in this\r\ncase, as the strength continually increases as the fibres are\r\ncrushed more compactly together.\r\n\r\n_Calculating the results_: Ordinarily only the fibre stress at\r\nthe elastic limit (c) is computed. It is equal to the load at\r\nelastic limit (P_{1}) divided by the area under the plate (B).\r\n{      P_{1}  }\r\n{ c = ------- }\r\n{        B    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEAR ALONG THE GRAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n_Apparatus_: An ordinary static testing machine and a special\r\ntool designed for producing single shear are required. (See\r\nFigs. 36 and 37.) This shearing apparatus consists of a solid\r\nsteel frame with set screws for clamping the block within it\r\nfirmly in a vertical position. In the centre of the frame is a\r\nvertical slot in which a square-edged steel plate slides freely.\r\nWhen the testing block is in position, this plate impinges\r\nsquarely along the upper surface of the tenon or lip, which, as\r\nvertical pressure is applied, shears off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Vertical section of shearing tool.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Front view of shearing tool with test\r\nspecimen and steel plate in position for testing.]\r\n\r\n_Preparing the material_: The specimens are usually in the form\r\nof small, clear, straight-grained blocks with a projecting tenon\r\nor lip to be sheared off. Two common forms and sizes are shown\r\nin Figure 38. Part of the blocks are cut so that the shearing\r\nsurface is parallel to the growth rings, or tangential; others\r\nat right angles to the growth rings, or radial. It is important\r\nthat the upper surface of the tenon or lip be sawed exactly\r\nparallel to the base of the block. When the form with a tenon is\r\nused the under cut is extended a short distance horizontally\r\ninto the block to prevent any compression from below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Two forms of shear test specimens.]\r\n\r\nIn designing a shearing specimen it is necessary to take into\r\nconsideration the proportions of the area of shear, since, if\r\nthe length of the portion to be sheared off is too great in the\r\ndirection of the shearing face, failure would occur by\r\ncompression before the piece would shear. Inasmuch as the\r\nendwise compressive strength is sometimes not more than five\r\ntimes the shearing strength, the shearing surface should be less\r\nthan five times the surface to which the load is applied. This\r\ncondition is fulfilled in the specimens illustrated.\r\n\r\nShearing specimens are frequently cut from beams after testing.\r\nIn this case the specific gravity (dry), proportion of late\r\nwood, and rate of growth are assumed to be the same as already\r\nrecorded for the beams. In specimens not so taken, these\r\nquantities are determined in the usual way. The sheared-off\r\nportion is used for a moisture section.\r\n\r\n_Adjusting specimen in machine_: The test specimen is placed in\r\nthe shearing apparatus with the tenon or lip under the sliding\r\nplate, which is centred under the movable head of the machine.\r\n(See Fig. 39.) In order to reduce to a minimum the friction due\r\nto the lateral pressure of the plate against the bearings of the\r\nslot, the apparatus is sometimes placed upon several parallel\r\nsteel rods to form a roller base. A slight initial load is\r\napplied to take up the lost motion of the machinery, and the\r\nbeam balanced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Making a shearing test.]\r\n\r\n_Log of the test_: The load is applied continuously and at a\r\nuniform rate until failure, but no deformations are measured.\r\nThe points noted are the maximum load and the length of time\r\nrequired to reach it. Sketches are made of the failure. If the\r\nfailure is not pure shear the test is culled.\r\n\r\nThe shearing strength per square inch is found by dividing the\r\n                                          {      P  }\r\nmaximum load by the cross-sectional area. { Q = --- }\r\n                                          {      A  }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPACT TEST\r\n\r\n\r\n_Apparatus_: There are several types of impact testing\r\nmachines.[59] One of the simplest and most efficient for use\r\nwith wood is illustrated in Figure 40. The base of the machine\r\nis 7 feet long, 2.5 feet wide at the centre, and weighs 3,500\r\npounds. Two upright columns, each 8 feet long, act as guides for\r\nthe striking head. At the top of the column is the hoisting\r\nmechanism for raising or lowering the striking weights. The\r\npower for operating the machine is furnished by a motor set on\r\nthe top. The hoisting-mechanism is all controlled by a single\r\noperating lever, shown on the side of the column, whereby the\r\nstriking weight may be raised, lowered, or stopped at the will\r\nof the operator. There is an automatic safety device for\r\nstopping the machine when the weight reaches the top.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: For description of U.S. Forest Service automatic\r\nand autographic impact testing machine, see Proc. Am. Soc. for\r\nTesting Materials, Vol. VIII, 1908, pp. 538-540.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Impact testing machine.]\r\n\r\nThe weight is lifted by a chain, one end of which passes over a\r\nsprocket wheel in the hoisting mechanism. On the lower end of\r\nthe chain is hung an electro-magnet of sufficient magnetic\r\nstrength to support the heaviest striking weights. When it is\r\ndesired to drop the striking weight the electric current is\r\nbroken and reversed by means of an automatic switch and current\r\nbreaker. The height of drop may be regulated by setting at the\r\ndesired height on one of the columns a tripping pin which throws\r\nthe switch on the magnet and so breaks and reverses the current.\r\n\r\nThere are four striking weights, weighing respectively 50, 100,\r\n250, and 500 pounds, any one of which may be used, depending\r\nupon the desired energy of blow. When used for compression tests\r\na flat steel head six inches in diameter is screwed into the\r\nlower end of the weight. For transverse tests, a well-rounded\r\nknife edge is screwed into the weight in place of the flat head.\r\nKnife edges for supporting the ends of the specimen to be\r\ntested, are securely bolted to the base of the machine.\r\n\r\nThe record of the behavior of the specimen at time of impact is\r\ntraced upon a revolving drum by a pencil fixed in the striking\r\nhead. (See Fig. 41.) When a drop is made the pencil comes in\r\ncontact with the drum and is held in place by a spring. The drum\r\nis revolved very slowly, either automatically or by hand. The\r\nspeed of the drum can be recorded by a pencil in the end of a\r\ntuning fork which gives a known number of vibrations per second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Drum record of impact bending test.]\r\n\r\nOne size of this machine will handle specimens for transverse\r\ntests 9 inches wide and 6-foot span; the other, 12 inches wide\r\nand 8-foot span. For compression tests a free fall of about 6.5\r\nfeet may be obtained. For transverse tests the fall is a little\r\nless, depending upon the size of the specimen.\r\n\r\nThe machine is calibrated by dropping the hammer upon a copper\r\ncylinder. The axial compression of the plug is noted. The energy\r\nused in static tests to produce this axial compression under\r\nstress in a like piece of metal is determined. The external\r\nenergy of the blow (_i.e._, the weight of the hammer X the\r\nheight of drop) is compared with the energy used in static tests\r\nat equal amounts of compression. For instance:\r\n\r\nEnergy delivered, impact test            35,000 inch-pounds\r\nEnergy computed from static test        .26,400   \"    \"\r\nEfficiency of blow of hammer            .75.3 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Preparing the material_: The material used in making impact\r\ntests is of the same size and prepared in the same way as for\r\nstatic bending and compression tests. Bending in impact tests is\r\nmore commonly used than compression, and small beams with\r\n28-inch span are usually employed.\r\n\r\n_Method_: In making an impact bending test the hammer is allowed\r\nto rest upon the specimen and a zero or datum line is drawn. The\r\nhammer is then dropped from increasing heights and drum records\r\ntaken until first failure. The first drop is one inch and the\r\nincrease is by increments of one inch until a height of ten\r\ninches is reached, after which increments of two inches are used\r\nuntil complete failure occurs or 6-inch deflection is secured.\r\n\r\nThe 50-pound hammer is used when with drops up to 68 inches it\r\nis reasonably certain it will produce complete failure or 6-inch\r\ndeflection in the case of all specimens of a species; for all\r\nother species a 100-pound hammer is used.\r\n\r\n_Results_: The tracing on the drum (see Fig. 41) represents the\r\nactual deflection of the stick and the subsequent rebounds for\r\neach drop. The distance from the lowest point in each case to\r\nthe datum line is measured and its square in tenths of a square\r\ninch entered as an abscissa on cross-section paper, with the\r\nheight of drop in inches as the ordinate. The elastic limit is\r\nthat point on the diagram where the square of the deflection\r\nbegins to increase more rapidly than the height of drop. The\r\ndifference between the datum line and the final resting point\r\nafter each drop represents the set the material has received.\r\n\r\nThe formulæ used in calculating the results of impact tests in\r\nbending when the load is applied at the centre up to the elastic\r\nlimit are as follows:\r\n\r\n               3 W H l\r\n     (1) r = -----------\r\n              D b h^{2}\r\n\r\n              F S l^{2}\r\n     (2) E = -----------\r\n                6 D h\r\n\r\n               W H\r\n     (3) S = -------\r\n              l b h\r\n\r\n  H = height of drop of hammer, including deflection, inches.\r\n  S = modulus of elastic resilience, inch-pounds per cubic inch.\r\n  W = weight of hammer, pounds.\r\n\r\nRemainder of legend as in BENDING LARGE BEAMS, above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDNESS TEST: ABRASION AND INDENTATION\r\n\r\n\r\n_Abrasion_: The machine used by the U.S. Forest Service is a\r\nmodified form of the Dorry abrasion machine. (See Fig. 42.) Upon\r\nthe revolving horizontal disk is glued a commercial sandpaper,\r\nknown as garnet paper, which is commonly employed in factories\r\nin finishing wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Abrasion machine for testing the\r\nwearing qualities of woods.]\r\n\r\nA small block of the wood to be tested is fixed in one clamp and\r\na similar block of some wood chosen as a standard, as sugar\r\nmaple, at 10 per cent moisture, in the opposite, and held\r\nagainst the same zone of sandpaper by a weight of 26 pounds\r\neach. The size of the section under abrasion for each specimen\r\nis 2\" X 2\". The conditions for wear are the same for both\r\nspecimens. The speed of rotation is 68 revolutions a minute.\r\n\r\nThe test is continued until the standard specimen is worn a\r\nspecified amount, which varies with the kind of wood under test.\r\nA comparison of the wear of the two blocks affords a fair idea\r\nof their relative resistance to abrasion.\r\n\r\nAnother method makes use of a sand blast to abrade the woods and\r\nis the one employed in New South Wales.[60] The apparatus\r\nconsists essentially of a nozzle through which sand can be\r\npropelled at a high velocity against the test specimen by means\r\nof a steam jet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: See Warren, W.H.: The strength, elasticity, and\r\nother properties of New South Wales hardwood timbers. Dept.\r\nFor., N.S.W., Sydney, 1911, pp. 88-95.]\r\n\r\nThe wood to be tested is cut into blocks 3\" X 3\" X 1', and these\r\nare weighed to the nearest grain just before placing in the\r\napparatus. Steam from the boiler at a pressure of about 43\r\npounds per square inch is ejected from a nozzle in such a way\r\nthat particles of fine quartz sand are caught up and thrown\r\nviolently against the block which is being rotated. Only\r\nsuperheated steam strikes the block, thus leaving the wood dry.\r\nThe test is continued for two minutes, after which the specimen\r\nis removed and immediately weighed.\r\n\r\nBy comparison with the original weight the loss from abrasion is\r\ndetermined, and by comparison with a certain wood chosen as a\r\nstandard, a coefficient of wear-resistance can be obtained. The\r\namount of wear will vary more or less according to the surface\r\nexposed, and in these tests quarter-sawed material was used with\r\nthe edge grain to the blast.\r\n\r\n_Indentation_: The tool used for this test consists of a punch\r\nwith a hemispherical end or steel ball having a diameter of\r\n0.444 inch, giving a surface area of one-fourth square inch. It\r\nis fitted with a guard plate, which works loosely until the\r\npenetration has progressed to a depth of 0.222 inch, whereupon\r\nit tightens. (See Fig. 43.) The effect is that of sinking a ball\r\nhalf its diameter into the specimen. This apparatus is fitted\r\ninto the movable head of the static testing machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Design of tool for testing the hardness\r\nof woods by indentation.]\r\n\r\nThe wood to be tested is cut square with the grain into\r\nrectangular blocks measuring 2\" X 2\" X 6\". A block is placed on\r\nthe platform and the end of the punch forced into the wood at\r\nthe rate of 0.25 inch per minute. The operator keeps moving the\r\nsmall handle of the guard plate back and forth until it\r\ntightens. At this instant the load is read and recorded.\r\n\r\nTwo penetrations each are made on the tangential and radial\r\nsurfaces, and one on each end of every specimen tested.\r\n\r\nIn choosing the places on the block for the indentations, effort\r\nshould be made to get a fair average of heartwood and sapwood,\r\nfine and coarse grain, early and late wood.\r\n\r\nAnother method of testing by indentation involves the use of a\r\nright-angled cone instead of a ball. For details of this test as\r\nused in New South Wales see _loc. cit._, pp. 86-87.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEAVAGE TEST\r\n\r\n\r\nA static testing machine and a special cleavage testing device\r\nare required. (See Fig. 44.) The latter consists essentially of\r\ntwo hooks, one of which is suspended from the centre of the top\r\nof the cage, the other extended above the movable head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Design of tool for cleavage test.]\r\n\r\nThe specimens are 2\" X 2\" X 3.75\". At one end a one-inch hole is\r\nbored, with its centre equidistant from the two sides and 0.25\r\ninch from the end. (See Fig. 45.) This makes the cross section\r\nto be tested 2\" X 3\". Some of the blocks are cut radially and\r\nsome tangentially, as indicated in the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Design of cleavage test specimen.]\r\n\r\nThe free ends of the hooks are fitted into the notch in the end\r\nof the specimen. The movable head of the machine is then made to\r\ndescend at the rate of 0.25 inch per minute, pulling apart the\r\nhooks and splitting the block. The maximum load only is taken\r\nand the result expressed in pounds per square inch of width. A\r\npiece one-half inch thick is split off parallel to the failure\r\nand used for moisture determination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTENSION TEST PARALLEL TO THE GRAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the tensile strength of wood parallel to the grain is\r\ngreater than the compressive strength, and exceedingly greater\r\nthan the shearing strength, it is very difficult to make\r\nsatisfactory tension tests, as the head and shoulders of the\r\ntest specimen (which is subjected to both compression and shear)\r\nmust be stronger than the portion subjected to a pure tensile\r\nstress.\r\n\r\nVarious designs of test specimens have been made. The one first\r\nemployed by the Division of Forestry[61] was prepared as\r\nfollows: Sticks were cut measuring 1.5\" X 2.5\" X 16\". The\r\nthickness at the centre was then reduced to three-eighths of an\r\ninch by cutting out circular segments with a band saw. This left\r\na breaking section of 2.5\" X 0.375\". Care was taken to cut the\r\nspecimen as nearly parallel to the grain as possible, so that\r\nits failure would occur in a condition of pure tension. The\r\nspecimen was then placed between the plane wedge-shaped steel\r\ngrips of the cage and the movable head of the static machine and\r\npulled in two. Only the maximum load was recorded. (See Fig. 46,\r\nNo. 1.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Designs of tension test specimens used\r\nin United States.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Bul. No. 8: Timber physics, Part II., 1893, p. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of making such tests compared with the minor\r\nimportance of the results is so great that they are at present\r\nomitted by the U.S. Forest Service. A form of specimen is\r\nsuggested, however, and is as follows: \"A rod of wood about one\r\ninch in diameter is bored by a hollow drill from the stick to be\r\ntested. The ends of this rod are inserted and glued in\r\ncorresponding holes in permanent hardwood wedges. The specimen\r\nis then submitted to the ordinary tension test. The broken ends\r\nare punched from the wedges.\"[62] (See Fig. 46, No. 2.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Cir. 38: Instructions to engineers of timber\r\ntests, 1906, p. 24.]\r\n\r\nThe form used by the Department of Forestry of New South\r\nWales[63] is as shown in Fig. 47. The specimen has a total\r\nlength of 41 inches and is circular in cross section. On each\r\nend is a head 4 inches in diameter and 7 inches long. Below each\r\nhead is a shoulder 8.5 inches long, which tapers from a diameter\r\nof 2.75 inches to 1.25 inches. In the middle is a cylindrical\r\nportion 1.25 inches in diameter and 10 inches long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Design of tension test specimen used in\r\nNew South Wales.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Warren, W.H.: The strength, elasticity, and other\r\nproperties of New South Wales hardwood timbers, 1911, pp.\r\n58-62.]\r\n\r\nIn making the test the specimen is fitted in the machine, and an\r\nextensometer attached to the middle portion and arranged to\r\nrecord the extension between the gauge points 8 inches apart.\r\nThe area of the cross section then is 1.226 square inches, and\r\nthe tensile strength is equal to the total breaking load applied\r\ndivided by this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTENSION TEST AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE GRAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nA static testing machine and a special testing device (see Fig.\r\n48) are required. The latter consists essentially of two double\r\nhooks or clamps, one of which is suspended from the centre of\r\nthe top of the cage, the other extended above the movable head.\r\nThe specimens are 2\" X 2\" X 2.5\". At each end a one-inch hole is\r\nbored with its centre equidistant from the two sides and 0.25\r\ninch from the ends. This makes the cross section to be tested 1\"\r\nX 2\".\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Design of tool and specimen for testing\r\ntension at right angles to the grain.]\r\n\r\nThe free ends of the clamps are fitted into the notches in the\r\nends of the specimen. The movable head of the machine is then\r\nmade to descend at the rate of 0.25 inch per minute, pulling the\r\nspecimen in two at right angles to the grain. The maximum load\r\nonly is taken and the result expressed in pounds per inch of\r\nwidth. A piece one-half inch thick is split off parallel to the\r\nfailure and used for moisture determination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTORSION TEST[64]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Wood is so seldom subjected to a pure stress of\r\nthis kind that the torsion test is usually omitted.]\r\n\r\n_Apparatus_: The torsion test is made in a Riehle-Miller\r\ntorsional testing machine or its equivalent. (See Fig. 49.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Making a torsion test on hickory.]\r\n\r\n_Preparation of material_: The test pieces are cylindrical, 1.5\r\ninches in diameter and 18 inches gauge length, with squared ends\r\n4 inches long joined to the cylindrical portion with a fillet.\r\nThe dimensions are carefully measured, and the usual data\r\nobtained in regard to the rate of growth, proportion of late\r\nwood, location and kind of defects. The weight of the\r\ncylindrical portion of the specimen is obtained after the test.\r\n\r\n_Making the test_: After the specimen is fitted in the machine\r\nthe load is applied continuously at the rate of 22° per minute.\r\nA troptometer is used in measuring the deformation. Readings are\r\nmade until failure occurs, the points being entered on the\r\ncross-section paper. The character of the failure is described.\r\nMoisture determinations are made by the disk method.\r\n\r\n_Results_: The conditions of ultimate rupture due to torsion\r\nappear not to be governed by definite mathematical laws; but\r\nwhere the material is not overstrained, laws may be assumed\r\nwhich are sufficiently exact for practical cases. The formulæ\r\ncommonly used for computations are as follows:\r\n\r\n              5.1 M\r\n     (1) T = -------\r\n              c^{3}\r\n\r\n              114.6 T f\r\n     (2) G = -----------\r\n                 a c\r\n\r\n  a = angle measured by troptometer at elastic limit, in\r\n        degrees.\r\n  c = diameter of specimen, inches.\r\n  f = gauge length of specimen, inches. _G_ = modulus of\r\n        elasticity in shear across the grain, pounds per square\r\n        inch.\r\n  M = moment of torsion at elastic limit, inch-pounds.\r\n  T = outer fibre torsional stress at elastic limit, pounds per\r\n        square inch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL TESTS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spike-pulling Test_\r\n\r\nSpike-pulling tests apply to problems of railroad maintenance,\r\nand the results are used to compare the spike-holding powers of\r\nvarious woods, both untreated and treated with different\r\npreservatives, and the efficiency of various forms of spikes.\r\nSpecial tests are also made in which the spike is subjected to a\r\ntransverse load applied repetitively by a blow.\r\n\r\nFor details of tests and results see:\r\n\r\nCir. 38,  U.S.F.S.: Instructions to engineers of timber tests,\r\np. 26. Cir. 46,  U.S.F.S.: Holding force of railroad spikes in\r\nwooden ties. Bul. 118, U.S.F.S,: Prolonging the life of\r\ncross-ties, pp. 37-40.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Packing Boxes_\r\n\r\nSpecial tests on the strength of packing boxes of various woods\r\nhave been made by the U.S. Forest Service to determine the\r\nmerits of different kinds of woods as box material with the view\r\nof substituting new kinds for the more expensive ones now in\r\nuse. The methods of tests consisted in applying a load along the\r\ndiagonal of a box, an action similar to that which occurs when a\r\nbox is dropped on one of its corners. The load was measured at\r\neach one-fourth inch in deflection, and notes were made of the\r\nprimary and subsequent failures.\r\n\r\nFor details of tests and results, see:\r\n\r\nCir. 47,  U.S.F.S.: Strength of packing boxes of various woods.\r\nCir. 214, U.S.F.S.: Tests of packing boxes of various forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vehicle and Implement Woods_\r\n\r\nTests were made by the U.S. Forest Service to obtain a better\r\nknowledge of the mechanical properties of the woods at present\r\nused in the manufacture of vehicles and implements and of those\r\nwhich might be substituted for them. Tests were made upon the\r\nfollowing materials: hickory buggy spokes (see Fig. 5); hickory\r\nand red oak buggy shafts; wagon tongues; Douglas fir and\r\nsouthern pine cultivator poles.\r\n\r\nDetails of the tests and results may be found in:\r\n\r\nCir. 142, U.S.F.S.: Tests on vehicle and implement woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cross-arms_\r\n\r\nIn tests by the U.S. Forest Service on cross-arms a special\r\napparatus was devised in which the load was distributed along\r\nthe arm as in actual practice. The load was applied by rods\r\npassing through the pinholes in the arms. Nuts on these rods\r\npulled down on the wooden bearing-blocks shaped to fit the upper\r\nside of the arm. The lower ends of these rods were attached to a\r\nsystem of equalizing levers, so arranged that the load at each\r\npinhole would be the same. In all the tests the load was applied\r\nvertically by means of the static machine.\r\n\r\nSee Cir. 204, U.S.F.S.: Strength tests of cross-arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Tests_\r\n\r\nMany other kinds of tests are made as occasion demands. One kind\r\nconsists of barrels and liquid containers, match-boxes, and\r\nexplosive containers. These articles are subjected to shocks\r\nsuch as they would receive in transit and in handling, and also\r\nto hydraulic pressure.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important tests from a practical standpoint is\r\nthat of built-up structures such as compounded beams composed of\r\nsmall pieces bolted together, mortised joints, wooden trusses,\r\netc. Tests of this kind can best be worked out according to the\r\nspecific requirements in each case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMPLE WORKING PLAN OF THE U.S. FOREST SERVICE\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF WOODS GROWN IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nWorking Plan No. 124\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPOSE OF WORK\r\n\r\nIt is the general purpose of the work here outlined to provide:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Reliable data for comparing the mechanical properties of\r\nvarious species;\r\n\r\n(_b_) Data for the establishment of correct strength functions\r\nor working stresses;\r\n\r\n(_c_) Data upon which may be based analyses of the influence on\r\nthe mechanical properties of such factors as:\r\n\r\nLocality;\r\n\r\nDistance of timber from the pith of the tree;\r\n\r\nHeight of timber in the tree;\r\n\r\nChange from the green to the air-dried condition, etc.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical properties which will be considered and the\r\nprincipal tests used to determine them are as follows:\r\n\r\nStrength and stiffness--\r\n  Static bending;\r\n  Compression parallel to grain;\r\n  Compression perpendicular to grain;\r\n  Shear.\r\n\r\nToughness--\r\n  Impact bending;\r\n  Static bending;\r\n  Work to maximum load and total work.\r\n\r\nCleavability--\r\n  Cleavage test.\r\n\r\nHardness--\r\n  Modification of Janka ball test for surface hardness.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL\r\n\r\n\r\n_Selection and Number of Trees_\r\n\r\nThe material will be from trees selected in the forest by one\r\nqualified to determine the species. From each locality, three to\r\nfive dominant trees of merchantable size and approximately\r\naverage age will be so chosen as to be representative of the\r\ndominant trees of the species. Each species will eventually be\r\nrepresented by trees from five to ten localities. These\r\nlocalities will be so chosen as to be representative of the\r\ncommercial range of the species. Trees from one to three\r\nlocalities will be used to represent each species until most of\r\nthe important species have been tested.\r\n\r\nThe 16-foot butt log will be taken from each tree selected and\r\nthe entire merchantable hole of one average tree for each\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Field Notes and Shipping Instructions_\r\n\r\nField notes as outlined in Form--_a_ Shipment Description,\r\nManual of the Branch of Products, will be fully and carefully\r\nmade by the collector. The age of each tree selected will be\r\nrecorded and any other information likely to be of interest or\r\nimportance will also be made a part of these field notes. Each\r\nlog will have the bark left on. It will be plainly marked in\r\naccordance with directions given under Detailed Instructions.\r\nAll material will be shipped to the laboratory immediately after\r\nbeing cut. No trees will be cut until the collector is notified\r\nthat the laboratory is ready to receive the material.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETAILED INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Part of Tree to be Tested_\r\n\r\n(_a_) For determining the value of tree and locality and the\r\ninfluence on the mechanical properties of distance from the\r\npith, a 4-foot bolt will be cut from the top end of each 16-foot\r\nbutt log.\r\n\r\n(_b_) For investigating the variation of properties with the\r\nheight of timber in the tree, all the logs from one average tree\r\nwill be used.\r\n\r\n(_c_) For investigating the effect of drying the wood, the bolt\r\nnext below that provided for in (_a_) will be used in the case\r\nof one tree from each locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marking and Grouping of Material_\r\n\r\nThe marking will be standard except as noted. Each log will be\r\nconsidered a \"piece.\" The piece numbers will be plainly marked\r\nupon the butt end of each log by the collector. The north side\r\nof each log will also be marked.\r\n\r\nWhen only one bolt from a tree is used it will be designated by\r\nthe number of the log from which it is cut. Whenever more than\r\none bolt is taken from a tree, each 4-foot bolt or length of\r\ntrunk will be given a letter (mark), _a, b, c,_ etc., beginning\r\nat the stump.\r\n\r\nAll bolts will be sawed into 2-1/2\" X 2-1/2\" sticks and the\r\nsticks marked according to the sketch, Fig. 50. The letters _N,\r\nE, S,_ and _W_ indicate the cardinal points when known; when\r\nthese are unknown, _H, K, L,_ and _M_ will be used. Thus, _N5,\r\nK8, S7, M4_ are stick numbers, the letter being a part of the\r\nstick number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Method of cutting and marking test\r\nspecimens.]\r\n\r\nOnly straight-grained specimens, free from defects which will\r\naffect their strength, will be tested.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Care of Material_\r\n\r\nNo material will be kept in the bolt or log long enough to be\r\ndamaged or disfigured by checks, rot, or stains.\r\n\r\n_Green material_: The material to be tested green will be kept\r\nin a green state by being submerged in water until near the time\r\nof test. It will then be surfaced, sawed to length, and stored\r\nin damp sawdust at a temperature of 70°F. (as nearly as\r\npracticable) until time of test. Care should be taken to avoid\r\nas much as possible the storage of green material in any form.\r\n\r\n_Air-dry material_: The material to be air-dried will be cut\r\ninto sticks 2-1/2\" X 2-1/2\" X 4'. The ends of these sticks will\r\nbe paraffined to prevent checking. This material will be so\r\npiled as to leave an air space of at least one-half inch on each\r\nside of each stick, and in such a place that it will be\r\nprotected from sunshine, rain, snow, and moisture from the\r\nground. The sticks will be surfaced and cut to length just\r\nprevious to test.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order of Tests_\r\n\r\nThe order of tests in all cases will be such as to eliminate so\r\nfar as possible from the comparisons the effect of changes of\r\ncondition of the specimens due to such factors as storage and\r\nweather conditions.\r\n\r\nThe material used for determining the effect of height in tree\r\nwill be tested in such order that the average time elapsing from\r\ntime of cutting to time of test will be approximately the same\r\nfor all bolts from any one tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tests on Green Material_\r\n\r\nThe tests on all bolts, except those from which a comparison of\r\ngreen and dry timber is to be gotten, will be as follows:\r\n\r\n_Static bending_: One stick from each pair. A pair consists of\r\ntwo adjacent sticks equidistant from the pith, as _N_7 and _N_8,\r\nor _H_5 and _H_6.\r\n\r\n_Impact bending_: Four sticks; one to be taken from near the\r\npith; one from near the periphery; and two representative of the\r\ncross section.\r\n\r\n_Compression parallel to grain_: One specimen from each stick.\r\nThese will be marked \"1\" in addition to the number of the stick\r\nfrom which they are taken.\r\n\r\n_Compression perpendicular to grain_: One specimen from each of\r\n50 per cent of the static bending sticks. These will be marked\r\n\"2\" in addition to the number of the stick from which they are\r\ncut.\r\n\r\n_Hardness_: One specimen from each of the other 50 per cent of\r\nthe static bending sticks. These specimens will be marked \"4.\"\r\n\r\n_Shear_: Six specimens from sticks not tested in bending or from\r\nthe ends cut off in preparing the bending specimens. Two\r\nspecimens will be taken from near the pith; two from near the\r\nperiphery; and two that are representative of the average\r\ngrowth. One of each two will be tested in radial shear and the\r\nother in tangential shear. These specimens will have the mark\r\n\"3.\"\r\n\r\n_Cleavage_: Six specimens chosen and divided just as those for\r\nshearing. These specimens will have the mark \"5.\" (For sketches\r\nshowing radial and tangential cleavage, see Fig. 45.)\r\n\r\nWhen it is impossible to secure clear specimens for all of the\r\nabove tests, tests will have precedence in the order in which\r\nthey are named.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tests to Determine the Effect of Air-drying_\r\n\r\nThese tests will be made on material from the adjacent bolts\r\nmentioned in \"_c_\" under Part of Tree to be Tested. Both bolts\r\nwill be cut as outlined above. One-half the sticks from each\r\nbolt will be tested green, the other half will be air-dried and\r\ntested. The division of green and air-dry will be according to\r\nthe following scheme:\r\n\r\n                     STICK  NUMBERS\r\n\r\nLower bolt,  1,       4, 5,       8, 9,            } Tested\r\n                                            etc.   } green\r\nUpper bolt,     2, 3,       6, 7,       10,        }\r\n\r\nLower bolt,     2, 3,       6, 7,       10,        } Air-dried\r\n                                            etc.   } and\r\nUpper bolt,  1,       4, 5,       8, 9,            } tested\r\n\r\nAll green sticks from these two bolts will be tested as if they\r\nwere from the same bolt and according to the plan previously\r\noutlined for green material from single bolts. The tests on the\r\nair-dried material will be the same as on the green except for\r\nthe difference of seasoning.\r\n\r\nThe material will be tested at as near 12 per cent moisture as\r\nis practicable. The approximate weight of the air-dried\r\nspecimens at 12 per cent moisture will be determined by\r\nmeasuring while green 20 per cent of the sticks to be air-dried\r\nand assuming their dry gravity to be the same as that of the\r\nspecimens tested green. This 20 per cent will be weighed as\r\noften as is necessary to determine the proper time of test.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Methods of Test_\r\n\r\nAll tests will be made according to Circular 38 except in case\r\nof conflict with the instructions given below:\r\n\r\n_Static bending_: The tests will be on specimens 2\" X 2\" X 30\"\r\non 28-inch span. Load will be applied at the centre.\r\n\r\nIn all tests the load-deflection curve will be carried to or\r\nbeyond the maximum load. In one-third of the tests the\r\nload-deflection curve will be continued to 6-inch deflection, or\r\ntill the specimen fails to support a 200-pound load. Deflection\r\nreadings for equal increments of load will be taken until well\r\npast the elastic limit, after which the scale beam will be kept\r\nbalanced and the load read for each 0.1-inch deflection. The\r\nload and deflection at first failure, maximum load and points of\r\nsudden change, will be shown on the curve sheet even if they do\r\nnot occur at one of the regular load or deflection increments.\r\n\r\n_Impact bending_: The impact bending tests will be on specimens\r\nof the same size as those used in static bending. The span will\r\nbe 28 inches.\r\n\r\nThe tests will be by increment drop. The first drop will be 1\r\ninch and the increase will be by increments of 1 inch till a\r\nheight of 10 inches is reached, after which increments of 2\r\ninches will be used until complete failure occurs or 6-inch\r\ndeflection is secured.\r\n\r\nA 50-pound hammer will be used when with drops up to 68 inches\r\nit is practically certain that it will produce complete failure\r\nor 6-inch deflection in the case of all specimens of a species.\r\nFor all other species, a 100-pound hammer will be used.\r\n\r\nIn all cases drum records will be made until first failure. Also\r\nthe height of drop causing complete failure or 6-inch deflection\r\nwill be noted.\r\n\r\n_Compression parallel to grain_: This test will be on specimens\r\n2\" X 2\" X 8\" in size. On 20 per cent of these tests\r\nload-compression curves for a 6-inch centrally located gauge\r\nlength will be taken. Readings will be continued until the\r\nelastic limit is well passed. The other 80 per cent of the tests\r\nwill be made for the purpose of obtaining the maximum load only.\r\n\r\n_Compression perpendicular to grain_: This test will be on\r\nspecimens 2\" X 2\" X 6\" in size. The bearing plates will be 2\r\ninches wide. The rate of descent of the moving head will be\r\n0.024 inch per minute. The load-compression curve will be\r\nplotted to 0.1 inch compression and the test will then be\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\n_Hardness_: The tool shown in Fig. 43 (an adaptation of the\r\napparatus used by the German investigator, Janka) will be used.\r\nThe rate of descent of the moving head will be 0.25 inch per\r\nminute. When the penetration has progressed to the point at\r\nwhich the plate \"_a_\" becomes tight, due to being pressed\r\nagainst the wood, the load will be read and recorded.\r\n\r\nTwo penetrations will be made on a tangential surface, two on a\r\nradial, and one on each end of each specimen tested. The choice\r\nbetween the two radial and between the two tangential surfaces\r\nand the distribution of the penetrations over the surfaces will\r\nbe so made as to get a fair average of heart and sap, slow and\r\nfast growth, and spring and summer wood. Specimens will be 2\" X\r\n2\" X 6\".\r\n\r\n_Shear_: The tests will be made with a tool slightly modified\r\nfrom that shown in Circular 38. The speed of descent of head\r\nwill be 0.015 inch per minute. The only measurements to be made\r\nare those of the shearing area. The offset will be 1/8 inch.\r\nSpecimens will be 2\" X 2\" X 2-1/2\" in size. (For definition of\r\noffset and form of test specimen, see Fig. 38.)\r\n\r\n_Cleavage_: The cleavage tests will be made on specimens of the\r\nform and size shown in Fig. 45. The apparatus will be as shown\r\nin Fig. 44. The maximum load only will be taken and the result\r\nexpressed in pounds per inch of width. The speed of the moving\r\nhead will be 0.25 inch per minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Moisture Determinations_\r\n\r\nMoisture determinations will be made on all specimens tested\r\nexcept those to be photographed or kept for exhibit. A 1-inch\r\ndisk will be cut from near the point of failure of bending and\r\ncompression parallel specimens, from the portion under the plate\r\nin the case of the compression perpendicular specimens, and from\r\nthe centre of the hardness test specimens. The beads from the\r\nshear specimens will be used as moisture disks. In the case of\r\nthe cleavage specimens a piece 1/2 inch thick will be split off\r\nparallel to the failure and used as a moisture disk.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORDS\r\n\r\n\r\nAll records will be standard.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cross Sections_\r\n\r\nJust before cutting into sticks, the freshly cut end of at least\r\none bolt from each tree will be photographed. A scale of inches\r\nwill be shown in this photograph.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Specimens_\r\n\r\nThree photographs will be made of a group consisting of four 2\"\r\nX 2\" X 30\" specimens chosen from the material from each\r\nlocality. Two of these specimens will be representative of\r\naverage growth, one of fast and one of slow growth. These\r\nphotographs will show radial, tangential, and end surfaces for\r\neach specimen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Failures_\r\n\r\nTypical and abnormal failures of material from each site will be\r\nphotographed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Disposition of Material_\r\n\r\nThe specimens photographed to show typical and abnormal failures\r\nwill be saved for purposes of exhibit until deemed by the person\r\nin charge of the laboratory to be of no further value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHRINKAGE AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY\r\n\r\nAppendix to Working Plan 124\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPOSE OF WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of this work to secure data on the shrinkage\r\nand specific gravity of woods tested under Project 124. The\r\nfigures to be obtained are for use as average working values\r\nrather than as the basis for a detailed study of the principles\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe material will be taken from that provided for mechanical\r\ntests.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIAL AND TANGENTIAL SHRINKAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Specimens_\r\n\r\n_Preparation_: Two specimens 1 inch thick, 4 inches wide, and 1\r\ninch long will be obtained from near the periphery of each \"_d_\"\r\nbolt. These will be cut from the sector-shaped sections left\r\nafter securing the material for the mechanical tests or from\r\ndisks cut from near the end of the bolt. They will be taken from\r\nadjoining pieces chosen so that the results will be comparable\r\nfor use in determining radial and tangential shrinkage. (When a\r\ndisk is used, care must be taken that it is green and has not\r\nbeen affected by the shrinkage and checking near the end of the\r\nbolt.)\r\n\r\nOne of these specimens will be cut with its width in the radial\r\ndirection and will be used for the determination of radial\r\nshrinkage. The other will have its width in the tangential\r\ndirection and will be used for tangential shrinkage. These\r\nspecimens will not be surfaced.\r\n\r\n_Marking_: The shrinkage specimens will retain the shipment and\r\npiece numbers and marks of the bolts from which they are taken,\r\nand will have the additional mark _7_R or _7_T according as\r\ntheir widths are in the radial or tangential direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shrinkage measurements_: The shrinkage specimens will be\r\ncarefully weighed and measured soon after cutting. Rings per\r\ninch, per cent sap, and per cent summer wood will be measured.\r\nThey will then be air-dried in the laboratory to constant\r\nweight, and afterward oven-dried at 100°C. (212°F.), when they\r\nwill again be weighed and measured.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUMETRIC SHRINKAGE AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Specimens_\r\n\r\n_Selection and preparation_: Four 2\" X 2\" X 6\" specimens will be\r\ncut from the mechanical test sticks of each \"_d_\" bolt; also\r\nfrom each of the composite bolts used in getting a comparison of\r\ngreen and air-dry. One of these specimens will be taken from\r\nnear the pith and one from near the periphery; the other two\r\nwill be representative of the average growth of the bolt. The\r\nsides of these specimens will be surfaced and the ends smooth\r\nsawn.\r\n\r\n_Marking_: Each specimen will retain the shipment, piece, and\r\nstick numbers and mark of the stick from which it is cut, and\r\nwill have the additional mark \"_S_.\"\r\n\r\n_Manipulation_: Soon after cutting, each specimen will be\r\nweighed and its volume will be determined by the method\r\ndescribed below. The rings per inch and per cent summer wood,\r\nwhere possible, will be determined, and a carbon impression of\r\nthe end of the specimen made. It will then be air-dried in the\r\nlaboratory to a constant weight and afterward oven-dried at\r\n100°C. When dry, the specimen will be taken from the oven,\r\nweighed, and a carbon impression of its end made. While still\r\nwarm the specimen will be dipped in hot paraffine. The volume\r\nwill then be determined by the following method:\r\n\r\nOn one pan of a pair of balances is placed a container having in\r\nit water enough for the complete submersion of the test\r\nspecimen. This container and water is balanced by weights placed\r\non the other scale pan. The specimen is then held completely\r\nsubmerged and not touching the container while the scales are\r\nagain balanced. The weight required to balance is the weight of\r\nwater displaced by the specimen, and hence if in grams is\r\nnumerically equal to the volume of the specimen in cubic\r\ncentimetres. A diagrammatic sketch of the arrangement of this\r\napparatus is shown in Fig. 51.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Diagram of specific gravity apparatus,\r\nshowing a balance with container (_c_) filled with water in\r\nwhich the test block (_b_) is held submerged by a light rod\r\n(_a_) which is adjustable vertically and provided with a sharp\r\npoint to be driven into the specimen.]\r\n\r\nAir-dry specimens will be dipped in water and then wiped dry\r\nafter the first weighing and just before being immersed for\r\nweighing their displacement. All displacement determinations\r\nwill be made as quickly as possible in order to minimize the\r\nabsorption of water by the specimen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH VALUES FOR STRUCTURAL TIMBERS\r\n\r\n(From Cir. 189, U.S. Forest Service)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following tables bring together in condensed form the\r\naverage strength values resulting from a large number of tests\r\nmade by the Forest Service on the principal structural timbers\r\nof the United States. These results are more completely\r\ndiscussed in other publications of the Service, a list of which\r\nis given in BIBLIOGRAPHY, PART III.\r\n\r\nThe tests were made at the laboratories of the U.S. Forest\r\nService, in cooperation with the following institutions: Yale\r\nForest School, Purdue University, University of California,\r\nUniversity of Oregon, University of Washington, University of\r\nColorado, and University of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nTables XVIII and XIX give the average results obtained from\r\ntests on green material, while Tables XX and XXI give average\r\nresults from tests on air-seasoned material. The small\r\nspecimens, which were invariably 2\" X 2\" in cross section, were\r\nfree from defects such as knots, checks, and cross grain; all\r\nother specimens were representative of material secured in the\r\nopen market. The relation of stresses developed in different\r\nstructural forms to those developed in the small clear specimens\r\nis shown for each factor in the column headed \"Ratio to 2\" X\r\n2\".\" Tests to determine the mechanical properties of different\r\nspecies are often confined to small, clear specimens. The ratios\r\nincluded in the tables may be applied to such results in order\r\nto approximate the strength of the species in structural sizes,\r\nand containing the defects usually encountered, when tests on\r\nsuch forms are not available.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the results of tests on seasoned material with\r\nthose from tests on green material shows that, without\r\nexception, the strength of the 2\" X 2\" specimens is increased by\r\nlowering the moisture content, but that increase in strength of\r\nother sizes is much more erratic. Some specimens, in fact, show\r\nan apparent loss in strength due to seasoning. If structural\r\ntimbers are seasoned slowly, in order to avoid excessive\r\nchecking, there should be an increase in their strength. In the\r\nlight of these facts it is not safe to base working stresses on\r\nresults secured from any but green material. For a discussion of\r\nfactors of safety and safe working stresses for structural\r\ntimbers see the Manual of the American Railway Engineering\r\nAssociation, Chicago, 1911. A table from that publication,\r\ngiving working unit stresses for structural timber, is\r\nreproduced in this book, see Table XXII.\r\n\r\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| TABLE XVIII

NOTE.--The working unit-stresses given in the table are intended for railroad bridges and trestles. For highway bridges and trestles the unit-stresses may be increased          |\r\n| twenty-five (25) per cent. For  buildings and similar structures, in which the timber is protected from the weather and practically free from impact, the unit-stresses may be   |\r\n| increased fifty (50) per cent. To compute the deflection of a beam under long-continued loading instead of that when the load is first applied, only fifty (50) per cent of the  |\r\n| corresponding modulus of elasticity given in
